permaculture design today I want to talk
about<00:00:12.509> the<00:00:12.809> cause<00:00:13.019> and<00:00:13.440> cure<00:00:13.950> of<00:00:14.280> leaf<00:00:14.910> curl<00:00:15.330> in

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
about the cause and cure of leaf curl in

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.080 
about the cause and cure of leaf curl in
zucchini<00:00:16.170> plants<00:00:16.770> now<00:00:17.490> there's<00:00:17.699> typically

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
zucchini plants now there's typically

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.990 
zucchini plants now there's typically
two<00:00:18.240> causes<00:00:18.960> of<00:00:19.109> leaf<00:00:19.320> curl<00:00:19.619> one<00:00:20.430> is<00:00:20.609> white

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
two causes of leaf curl one is white

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.840 
two causes of leaf curl one is white
flies<00:00:21.330> and<00:00:21.720> the<00:00:21.930> other<00:00:22.109> is<00:00:22.320> aphids<00:00:22.800> both<00:00:23.580> of

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
flies and the other is aphids both of

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.599 
flies and the other is aphids both of
the<00:00:24.090> white<00:00:24.330> fly<00:00:24.750> and<00:00:25.109> the<00:00:25.230> aphid<00:00:25.680> prey<00:00:26.279> on<00:00:26.430> the

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
the white fly and the aphid prey on the

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.570 
the white fly and the aphid prey on the
leaf<00:00:26.820> of<00:00:27.119> the<00:00:27.689> zucchini<00:00:28.130> white<00:00:29.130> flies<00:00:29.369> in

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
leaf of the zucchini white flies in

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.120 
leaf of the zucchini white flies in
particular<00:00:30.060> will<00:00:30.510> be<00:00:30.539> underneath<00:00:30.990> and<00:00:31.560> they

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
particular will be underneath and they

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.549 
particular will be underneath and they
will<00:00:32.279> basically<00:00:32.820> suck<00:00:33.390> a<00:00:33.690> lot<00:00:34.350> of<00:00:34.469> the

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
will basically suck a lot of the

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.799 
will basically suck a lot of the
nutrients<00:00:35.070> out<00:00:35.190> of<00:00:35.250> the<00:00:35.430> zucchini<00:00:35.809> causing

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
nutrients out of the zucchini causing

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.840 
nutrients out of the zucchini causing
the<00:00:36.930> leaves<00:00:37.140> to<00:00:37.320> curl<00:00:37.590> a<00:00:37.829> lot<00:00:38.250> of<00:00:38.340> times<00:00:38.550> turn

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
the leaves to curl a lot of times turn

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.680 
the leaves to curl a lot of times turn
yellow<00:00:39.180> and<00:00:39.570> for<00:00:40.200> the<00:00:40.260> plant<00:00:40.530> to<00:00:40.739> start<00:00:41.010> to<00:00:41.190> die

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:41.690 
yellow and for the plant to start to die

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:45.260 
yellow and for the plant to start to die
so<00:00:42.690> now<00:00:42.960> one<00:00:43.680> thing<00:00:43.920> that<00:00:44.100> you<00:00:44.219> can<00:00:44.430> do<00:00:44.730> to

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
so now one thing that you can do to

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.350 
so now one thing that you can do to
prevent<00:00:45.510> white<00:00:46.079> flies<00:00:46.469> on<00:00:46.860> zucchinis<00:00:47.670> is<00:00:47.879> to

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
prevent white flies on zucchinis is to

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.090 
prevent white flies on zucchinis is to
regularly<00:00:48.690> inspect<00:00:49.230> the<00:00:49.410> leaves<00:00:49.649> look

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
regularly inspect the leaves look

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.279 
regularly inspect the leaves look
underneath<00:00:50.430> if<00:00:50.879> you<00:00:51.329> see<00:00:51.539> any<00:00:51.690> white<00:00:52.020> fly

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
underneath if you see any white fly

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.410 
underneath if you see any white fly
growing<00:00:52.770> there<00:00:52.920> you<00:00:53.340> want<00:00:53.520> to<00:00:53.610> physically<00:00:54.030> or

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
growing there you want to physically or

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.990 
growing there you want to physically or
manually<00:00:55.289> knock<00:00:55.920> off<00:00:56.160> that<00:00:56.430> white<00:00:56.699> fly

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
manually knock off that white fly

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.569 
manually knock off that white fly
another<00:00:57.870> thing<00:00:58.199> you<00:00:58.320> can<00:00:58.530> do<00:00:58.800> is<00:00:59.010> you<00:00:59.430> can

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
another thing you can do is you can

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.450 
another thing you can do is you can
spray<00:01:00.270> that<00:01:00.600> leaf<00:01:00.899> with<00:01:01.230> a<00:01:01.260> spray<00:01:01.800> bottle<00:01:02.100> and

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
spray that leaf with a spray bottle and

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.789 
spray that leaf with a spray bottle and
make<00:01:03.059> certain<00:01:03.329> that<00:01:03.480> there's<00:01:03.780> detergent<00:01:04.619> on

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
there a little drop or two and that will

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.760 
there a little drop or two and that will
actually<00:01:08.130> kill<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:08.880> white<00:01:09.090> fly<00:01:09.770> another

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
actually kill the white fly another

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.920

will<00:01:41.340> keep<00:01:41.579> those<00:01:41.850> leaves<00:01:42.150> off<00:01:42.299> the<00:01:42.659> ground<00:01:42.899> so

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
will keep those leaves off the ground so

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.370 
will keep those leaves off the ground so
that<00:01:43.409> they<00:01:43.530> don't<00:01:43.710> decay<00:01:44.960> another<00:01:45.960> thing<00:01:46.229> that
