 pokemon friend is amazing his pokemon 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:01.590
 have a lot of courage I have to admit that 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:04.439
 they do not do anything wrong 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:06.689
 great we have achieved it very safe 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:09.289
 after that explosion the crai was 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:09.289
 weakened 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:16.349
 this can not be resisted the attack 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.300
 and the worst is that he did not even suffer 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:20.430
 a lot of damage 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:22.740
 and you can know why you're surprised 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.450
 you should know that this attack is nothing 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:26.190
 against giving crime if you really want 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.440
 see a powerful attack then I'm going to 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:31.130
 show you the dark knight that the 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.130
 dark abyss 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:39.310
 motivate wake up please 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:42.750
 of that nothing will come out and use your attack 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:42.750
 of eating dreams and destroying 

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:53.230
 apparently mutin can not continue 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:56.850
 so the winner is dark ride and the 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:56.850
 first battle wins her tobias 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:03.240
 heavens we have lost a lot but I know that 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.920
 You have given your best effort in this 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:08.070
 battle and that's why I thank you 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:11.930

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:11.930
 we will not give up now 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:18.590
 that's how you talk a lot but now you must 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:21.050
 rest from now on I would 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:22.819
 I will take charge and give my best effort 

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:25.140
 as you have given it today I am proud 

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:27.120
 of you 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:29.370
 I see that you have a great link with your 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:31.140
 Pokemon are one of the few that I know 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:33.360
 who consider pokemon as friends 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:35.370
 you are certainly a great coach and 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:37.650
 someone to admire I hope we can 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:39.510
 keep giving a good fight and I'm 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:41.459
 I'm sure I'll never forget this battle 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:43.440
 now you must continue and take your 

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:45.720
 next pokemon 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:47.970
 Thanks for your words, you too 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:50.970
 you have a great friendship with your pokemon 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:53.940
 Okay enough of talks let's go crocco nou 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:56.210
 I choose you salt and use your attack lightning 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:56.210
 ice 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:05.790
 amazing that technique was amazing but 

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:08.880
 this still does not end long and use your 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:11.520
 shady pool attack with all your power 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:14.100
 chrono dodges the pulse a brio and jumps 

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:16.080
 about giving create and apparently not 

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:18.150
 You heard what I said while the 

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:22.040
 pulse a verve of looking cry is too 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:22.040
 fast your pokemon will never be able to avoid it 

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:25.470
 that's impossible 

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:33.510
 well done I think it does not use the 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:33.510
 ice fang with all your power 

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:39.520
 daldry shakes you over and hits 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:39.520
 what with your ice beam 

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:46.540
 but as you resist try to put yourself in 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:49.120
 stand and counterattack 

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:50.920
 it's too late the ice beam 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:52.840
 of giving cry is almost impossible to avoid 

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:56.550
 also your pokemon is in the air 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:56.550
 say goodbye to the swirling glass 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:08.009
 rays alone this was missing that coconut does not 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:10.320
 will freeze let's friend break that ice 

00:05:08.009 --> 00:05:12.660
 with your teeth 

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:14.400
 I'm sorry I admit that your pokemon is good 

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:16.590
 but I'm afraid I can not allow that 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:20.090
 escape daltrey use your ball of shadows and 

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:20.090
 end once with this battle 

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:33.080
 this can not be happening first 

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:35.060
 defeated mutquin and now acro with that 

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:36.440
 dark knight has a lot of power and the worst 

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:38.780
 is that he has not even received 

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:42.850
 enough damage if this continues like this 

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:42.850
 I will lose before I can do anything
