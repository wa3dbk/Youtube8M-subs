I<00:01:19.950> think<00:01:20.820> that<00:01:21.000> I<00:01:21.210> found<00:01:21.479> out<00:01:21.630> three

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
I think that I found out three

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.050 
I think that I found out three
kilometres<00:01:22.830> or<00:01:23.220> something<00:01:23.580> I<00:01:23.670> don't<00:01:23.850> know<00:01:23.939> in

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
kilometres or something I don't know in

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.060 
kilometres or something I don't know in
miles<00:01:24.330> so<00:01:25.259> I<00:01:25.350> thought<00:01:25.560> it<00:01:25.710> was<00:01:25.830> a<00:01:25.860> pretty

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
miles so I thought it was a pretty

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.460 
miles so I thought it was a pretty
distance<00:01:26.549> and<00:01:26.759> it's<00:01:26.880> true<00:01:27.240> it's<00:01:27.930> true<00:01:28.020> and<00:01:28.350> I

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
distance and it's true it's true and I

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.590 
distance and it's true it's true and I
also<00:01:28.650> noticed<00:01:29.159> that<00:01:29.220> when<00:01:29.520> they<00:01:30.299> were<00:01:30.360> thirsty

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
also noticed that when they were thirsty

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:37.069 
also noticed that when they were thirsty
they<00:01:30.960> walk<00:01:31.140> too<00:01:34.460> so<00:01:35.460> they<00:01:35.549> can<00:01:35.700> smell<00:01:36.079> that's

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
they walk too so they can smell that's

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:40.359
