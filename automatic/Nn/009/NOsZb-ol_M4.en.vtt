00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:13.999 
to point B along a minecart track
however<00:00:12.570> if<00:00:12.809> we<00:00:12.929> wanted<00:00:13.170> to<00:00:13.320> transport<00:00:13.710> a<00:00:13.769> item

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
however if we wanted to transport a item

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.730 
however if we wanted to transport a item
say<00:00:14.250> over<00:00:14.490> an<00:00:14.639> ocean<00:00:14.990> well<00:00:15.990> we'd<00:00:16.500> need<00:00:16.529> a

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
say over an ocean well we'd need a

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.040 
say over an ocean well we'd need a
storage<00:00:17.100> boat<00:00:17.430> and<00:00:17.880> that's<00:00:18.420> why<00:00:18.690> I<00:00:18.720> have<00:00:18.900> to

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
storage boat and that's why I have to

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.160 
storage boat and that's why I have to
show<00:00:19.140> you<00:00:19.199> today<00:00:20.390> so<00:00:21.390> to<00:00:21.449> demonstrate<00:00:21.750> just

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
show you today so to demonstrate just

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.740 
show you today so to demonstrate just
how<00:00:22.470> useful<00:00:22.769> this<00:00:23.039> could<00:00:23.279> be<00:00:23.430> I<00:00:23.640> want<00:00:24.539> you<00:00:24.600> to

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
how useful this could be I want you to

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.599 
how useful this could be I want you to
imagine<00:00:24.900> that<00:00:25.230> we<00:00:25.320> have<00:00:25.470> two<00:00:25.500> ports<00:00:26.070> we<00:00:26.430> have

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
imagine that we have two ports we have

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.120 
imagine that we have two ports we have
the<00:00:26.789> jungle<00:00:27.000> port<00:00:27.420> and<00:00:27.720> the<00:00:28.410> fisherman<00:00:28.859> port

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
the jungle port and the fisherman port

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.510 
the jungle port and the fisherman port
now<00:00:29.880> let's<00:00:30.330> imagine<00:00:30.539> we're<00:00:31.080> on<00:00:31.260> a<00:00:31.500> server<00:00:31.769> so

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
now let's imagine we're on a server so

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:33.950 
now let's imagine we're on a server so
on<00:00:32.640> this<00:00:32.759> server<00:00:32.969> there<00:00:33.120> are<00:00:33.210> two<00:00:33.360> towns<00:00:33.630> we've

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
on this server there are two towns we've

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.170 
on this server there are two towns we've
got<00:00:34.079> jungle<00:00:34.380> Ville<00:00:34.649> and<00:00:34.829> we<00:00:35.130> have<00:00:35.340> fish<00:00:35.880> Ville

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
got jungle Ville and we have fish Ville

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.709 
got jungle Ville and we have fish Ville
so<00:00:37.079> fish<00:00:37.469> feel<00:00:37.770> is<00:00:37.980> great<00:00:38.250> at<00:00:38.579> catching<00:00:39.270> fish

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
so fish feel is great at catching fish

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.450 
so fish feel is great at catching fish
whereas<00:00:40.230> jungle<00:00:40.649> Ville<00:00:40.770> is<00:00:40.800> great<00:00:41.219> at

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
whereas jungle Ville is great at

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.940 
whereas jungle Ville is great at
harvesting<00:00:42.000> coca<00:00:42.329> beans<00:00:42.480> now<00:00:43.350> both<00:00:43.680> of<00:00:43.710> these

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
harvesting coca beans now both of these

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.639 
harvesting coca beans now both of these
villages<00:00:44.460> or<00:00:44.820> towns<00:00:44.850> want<00:00:45.629> to<00:00:45.989> trade<00:00:46.469> with

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
villages or towns want to trade with

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.190 
villages or towns want to trade with
each<00:00:46.770> other<00:00:46.950> how<00:00:47.940> do<00:00:48.000> they<00:00:48.180> do<00:00:48.239> that<00:00:48.360> well

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
each other how do they do that well

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.869 
each other how do they do that well
there's<00:00:49.559> a<00:00:49.620> river<00:00:49.829> connecting<00:00:50.460> both<00:00:50.579> of<00:00:50.789> them

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
there's a river connecting both of them

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.020 
there's a river connecting both of them
together<00:00:51.379> so<00:00:52.379> the<00:00:53.010> obvious<00:00:53.399> solution<00:00:53.579> here<00:00:53.820> is

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
together so the obvious solution here is

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.080 
together so the obvious solution here is
to<00:00:54.390> use<00:00:54.510> storage<00:00:55.020> boats<00:00:55.370> so<00:00:56.370> here<00:00:56.730> is<00:00:56.850> the

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
to use storage boats so here is the

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.119 
to use storage boats so here is the
storage<00:00:57.420> boat<00:00:57.660> I've<00:00:57.809> been<00:00:58.020> talking<00:00:58.320> about<00:00:58.410> so

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
storage boat I've been talking about so

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:00.410 
storage boat I've been talking about so
the<00:00:59.219> jungle<00:00:59.489> village<00:00:59.579> want<00:00:59.940> to<00:01:00.030> strode<00:01:00.270> with

wouldn't you say so it's time to show
you<00:01:53.310> how<00:01:53.610> this<00:01:53.820> works<00:01:54.060> so<00:01:54.479> this<00:01:55.350> is<00:01:55.500> composed

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
you how this works so this is composed

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.310 
you how this works so this is composed
of<00:01:56.159> five<00:01:56.369> things<00:01:56.729> we<00:01:57.030> have<00:01:57.659> a<00:01:57.689> minecart

of five things we have a minecart
we<00:01:58.560> have<00:01:58.680> two<00:01:58.829> slimes<00:01:59.159> we<00:01:59.640> have<00:01:59.880> a<00:02:00.119> boat<00:02:00.600> and<00:02:00.930> we

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
we have two slimes we have a boat and we

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.590 
we have two slimes we have a boat and we
have<00:02:01.200> a<00:02:01.229> horse<00:02:01.640> so<00:02:02.640> you've<00:02:03.210> already<00:02:03.299> already

have a horse so you've already already
figure<00:02:03.810> out<00:02:03.930> right<00:02:04.079> now<00:02:04.140> but<00:02:04.560> there<00:02:04.770> are<00:02:05.090> sort

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
figure out right now but there are sort

figure out right now but there are sort
of<00:02:06.119> what<00:02:06.509> hear<00:02:06.810> it<00:02:06.930> so<00:02:07.560> first<00:02:07.799> of<00:02:07.950> all<00:02:08.069> we<00:02:08.160> have

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
of what hear it so first of all we have

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.089 
of what hear it so first of all we have
the<00:02:08.729> minecart<00:02:09.239> track<00:02:09.300> to<00:02:09.810> guide<00:02:10.289> the<00:02:10.649> boat<00:02:10.950> on

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
the minecart track to guide the boat on

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:12.160 
the minecart track to guide the boat on
its<00:02:11.250> route

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
its route

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:15.680 
its route
so<00:02:13.170> on<00:02:13.290> top<00:02:13.380> of<00:02:13.530> that<00:02:13.650> we<00:02:13.860> have<00:02:14.100> two<00:02:14.790> slimes<00:02:15.240> to

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
so on top of that we have two slimes to

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.500 
so on top of that we have two slimes to
create<00:02:15.990> a<00:02:16.140> space<00:02:16.890> of<00:02:17.070> air<00:02:17.280> so<00:02:17.730> the<00:02:18.030> is<00:02:18.240> a<00:02:18.270> big

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
create a space of air so the is a big

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:19.490 
create a space of air so the is a big
there's<00:02:18.750> a<00:02:18.810> difference<00:02:19.110> through<00:02:19.230> where<00:02:19.440> the

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
there's a difference through where the

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.070 
there's a difference through where the
mind<00:02:19.680> got<00:02:19.830> is<00:02:19.950> and<00:02:20.070> the<00:02:20.130> boat<00:02:20.280> is<00:02:20.310> and<00:02:20.840> then<00:02:21.840> got

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
mind got is and the boat is and then got

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.470 
mind got is and the boat is and then got
the<00:02:22.170> boat<00:02:22.350> and<00:02:22.740> then<00:02:23.460> top<00:02:23.580> of<00:02:23.670> the<00:02:23.760> boat<00:02:23.940> we

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
the boat and then top of the boat we

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.000 
the boat and then top of the boat we
have<00:02:24.720> an<00:02:24.960> invisible<00:02:25.200> horse

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
have an invisible horse

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.270 
have an invisible horse
well<00:02:26.700> invisible<00:02:27.390> horse<00:02:27.540> with<00:02:27.720> chests<00:02:28.230> so<00:02:28.980> if

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
well invisible horse with chests so if

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.140 
well invisible horse with chests so if
we<00:02:29.400> shift-click<00:02:29.970> whilst<00:02:30.870> they're<00:02:31.110> in<00:02:31.290> the

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
we shift-click whilst they're in the

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.910 
we shift-click whilst they're in the
horse<00:02:33.150> inventory<00:02:34.050> pops<00:02:34.290> up<00:02:34.470> but<00:02:34.590> because<00:02:34.740> the

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
horse inventory pops up but because the

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.070 
horse inventory pops up but because the
whole<00:02:34.980> storage<00:02:35.550> boat<00:02:35.820> it<00:02:36.030> comes<00:02:36.600> up<00:02:36.720> a<00:02:36.810> storage

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
whole storage boat it comes up a storage

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.210 
whole storage boat it comes up a storage
boat<00:02:37.290> and<00:02:38.930> so<00:02:39.930> to<00:02:39.990> get<00:02:40.320> a<00:02:40.380> little<00:02:40.650> chest<00:02:40.890> effect

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
boat and so to get a little chest effect

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:44.150 
boat and so to get a little chest effect
all<00:02:41.850> I<00:02:42.060> simply<00:02:42.480> did<00:02:42.690> was<00:02:42.990> I<00:02:43.350> changed<00:02:43.860> the

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
all I simply did was I changed the

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.740 
all I simply did was I changed the
texture<00:02:44.580> of<00:02:44.670> the<00:02:45.000> I<00:02:45.209> didn't<00:02:45.480> change<00:02:45.690> the

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
texture of the I didn't change the

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.660 
texture of the I didn't change the
texture<00:02:46.080> by<00:02:46.230> made<00:02:46.890> it<00:02:47.040> so<00:02:47.130> that<00:02:47.160> mine<00:02:47.459> cut

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
texture by made it so that mine cut

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.810 
texture by made it so that mine cut
displays<00:02:48.090> the<00:02:48.570> chest<00:02:49.370> texture<00:02:50.370> instead<00:02:50.700> of

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:50.820 
displays the chest texture instead of

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:54.530 
displays the chest texture instead of
the<00:02:50.940> furnace<00:02:51.090> texture<00:02:51.660> and<00:02:52.520> I<00:02:53.520> then<00:02:53.850> change

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
the furnace texture and I then change

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.720 
the furnace texture and I then change
the<00:02:54.870> offset<00:02:55.170> about<00:02:55.860> to<00:02:56.070> about<00:02:56.220> 100<00:02:56.610> or

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
the offset about to about 100 or

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.080 
the offset about to about 100 or
something<00:02:56.850> so<00:02:57.300> that<00:02:57.330> it<00:02:57.450> displayed<00:02:57.840> upwards

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.090 
something so that it displayed upwards

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:02.900 
something so that it displayed upwards
so<00:03:00.090> gaze<00:03:00.630> quite<00:03:01.140> easy<00:03:01.320> to<00:03:01.440> do<00:03:01.820> very<00:03:02.820> very

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
so gaze quite easy to do very very

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:05.479 
so gaze quite easy to do very very

it's<00:03:08.520> a<00:03:08.580> really<00:03:08.880> really<00:03:08.940> nifty<00:03:09.239> little<00:03:09.480> thing

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959 
it's a really really nifty little thing

it's a really really nifty little thing
