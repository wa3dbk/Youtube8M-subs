00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.920 
adapters today's installation will be
for<00:00:39.989> socket<00:00:40.379> 1155<00:00:41.100> motherboards<00:00:42.000> the<00:00:42.660> first

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
for socket 1155 motherboards the first

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.720 
for socket 1155 motherboards the first
step<00:00:43.170> is<00:00:43.350> to<00:00:43.469> put<00:00:43.680> the<00:00:43.710> four<00:00:44.040> socket<00:00:44.430> screws

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
step is to put the four socket screws

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.000 
step is to put the four socket screws
through<00:00:45.090> the<00:00:45.180> middle<00:00:45.570> hole<00:00:45.780> in<00:00:46.050> each<00:00:46.620> corner

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
through the middle hole in each corner

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.410 
through the middle hole in each corner
of<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.399> backplate<00:00:49.399> next<00:00:50.399> place<00:00:50.969> the<00:00:51.180> back

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
of the backplate next place the back

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.510 
of the backplate next place the back
plate<00:00:51.750> under<00:00:52.289> the<00:00:52.410> motherboard<00:00:52.920> making<00:00:53.340> sure

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
plate under the motherboard making sure

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.310 
plate under the motherboard making sure
that<00:00:53.730> the<00:00:53.879> socket<00:00:54.270> screws<00:00:54.539> stick<00:00:55.050> through<00:00:55.289> the

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
that the socket screws stick through the

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:07.170 
that the socket screws stick through the
socket<00:00:55.920> holes

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:07.180 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.240 

next<00:01:08.180> find<00:01:08.720> the<00:01:08.840> four<00:01:09.050> studs<00:01:09.380> and<00:01:09.680> place<00:01:10.040> them

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:10.250 
next find the four studs and place them

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:19.660 
next find the four studs and place them
on<00:01:10.430> top<00:01:10.460> of<00:01:10.730> the<00:01:11.000> socket<00:01:11.390> screws<00:01:17.950> now<00:01:18.950> we<00:01:19.460> will

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:19.670 
on top of the socket screws now we will

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:21.970 
on top of the socket screws now we will
install<00:01:20.000> the<00:01:20.150> strip<00:01:20.360> adapters<00:01:20.840> I'm<00:01:21.500> going<00:01:21.890> to

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:21.980 
install the strip adapters I'm going to

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:24.100 
install the strip adapters I'm going to
install<00:01:22.310> the<00:01:22.430> heatsink<00:01:22.850> horizontally<00:01:23.600> so<00:01:24.080> I

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:24.110 
install the heatsink horizontally so I

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:26.140 
install the heatsink horizontally so I
will<00:01:24.380> install<00:01:24.710> the<00:01:24.890> strip<00:01:25.100> adapters<00:01:25.580> on<00:01:25.790> the

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:26.150 
will install the strip adapters on the

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:29.469 
will install the strip adapters on the
two<00:01:26.390> top<00:01:26.930> socket<00:01:27.590> screws<00:01:27.950> and<00:01:28.190> the<00:01:28.850> two<00:01:29.030> bottom

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:55.080 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:11.280 

next<00:01:55.950> apply<00:01:56.610> the<00:01:56.700> thermal<00:01:57.210> compound

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.290 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:13.679 

now<00:02:11.920> we<00:02:12.459> will<00:02:12.580> set<00:02:12.790> up<00:02:12.939> the<00:02:13.060> heatsink<00:02:13.480> for

00:02:13.679 --> 00:02:13.689 
now we will set up the heatsink for

00:02:13.689 --> 00:02:16.289 
now we will set up the heatsink for
installation<00:02:14.409> first<00:02:15.310> we<00:02:15.849> will<00:02:15.970> need<00:02:16.150> to
