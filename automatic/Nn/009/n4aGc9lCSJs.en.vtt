00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 the one who spends my lives as they walk I am 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.720
 talent and we're here on straights at 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.309
 Devil number 9 let me see that everything is 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.200
 well the same if all that to see if already 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.540
 listen better to my voice now I bring 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.240
 another headset as you can see this is 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.920
 prettier this one is more comfortable a lot 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.170
 more comfortable because they ask him but 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:22.650
 well we are in challenges to the devil number 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:25.320
 9 so here it is difficult 9 out of 10 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.730
 a little horse is going to have a little horse 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.189
 the bad thing about the little horse is that you already know 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:32.189
 that in these generations in xbox one the 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:34.079
 little horse does not work, so let's go 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.360
 see let's see what wave we're going to see if 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.370
 yes it brings what brings the pinche challenges to the 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.230
 Devil number 9 I do not put it in first 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.000
 person because they already know that I'm in 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.399
 difficult click we always look up 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.260
 Gray Balentien doors to the devil so 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:49.850
 that before that means that the 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.850
 night they will see a gameplay leave it 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:59.070
 click easy this one is very important because 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.399
 time there because I do not have the 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.399
 video 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:09.760
 so the night they will see a gameplay 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:13.150
 of halo is very charged so for 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:16.710
 please do not tell me anything is very rude 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:16.710
 because he said 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:24.160
 and then I was playing halo because it's 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.140
 a game that I like very much but at 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:27.940
 look like the servers and I said I'm going to 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:30.040
 bring a hey gameplay not first and 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:32.380
 then I was going to go up in the night after 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:33.969
 promising day 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:36.070
 and I said I'll go up later the night 

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:38.320
 delay the devil but apparently it was not 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:40.329
 so from looking easy I'm doing 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.560
 I'm doing I'm doing that says 

00:01:40.329 --> 00:01:45.049
 it's a little horse that says 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:47.720
 there has to be a point where the 

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:50.479
 third person then what I'm going to 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:57.110
 to do is that I'm going to put the things of 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:59.240

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:20.180
 a little horse 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:27.510
 at the same time it 's a little horse and it's going to be 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:29.969
 well it's good in this little horse not 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:35.349
