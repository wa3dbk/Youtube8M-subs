00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:37.360

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:52.290

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:04.500
 five and we came on vacation for a month 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:07.650
 and it was both the impact with the 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.510
 family and with our friendships and 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.340
 with being in the same air again 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.290
 the same place that really started 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.990
 so much that we decided to go back is not that 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.759
 We came back because the place is better because 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.710
 things are better here 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:22.009
 we came back because of the feelings we saw 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:25.200
 because we really like our place 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:27.600
 we love this this beach that has a 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.729
 magical place is also caught I think that 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.119
 it weighed a lot in the story of my life in 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.119
 this place 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:58.840
 Being in the mall with my son is like no 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:02.320
 I know to be 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:04.689
 in peace in love all feelings 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:07.810
 positive is a learning the sea we 

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:10.840
 educate all of us every day 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:14.230
 let's associate also we tell ourselves things 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:18.250
 and we talk about what happens to us and we 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:21.640
 they share things with more confidence 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:24.910
 because it's something that really deum you there 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:26.440
 transmits that does not open you as 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:30.069
 person as father 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:31.410
 with your son and he's happy doing that 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:33.900
 and to me 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:35.610
 it is what feeds me the most to see my son 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.640
 happy doing something that I too what 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:41.040
 I do and I can go to the water with him I think 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.840
 is something unique or can you share 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.760
 thousands of things but going to do something that 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.680
 they really like the two or my 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:49.160
 son and I do not want to do it all 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:52.510
 the days is something 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.510

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:07.800
