that the company was created by doctors

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.600 
that the company was created by doctors
and<00:03:09.570> they<00:03:09.959> thought<00:03:10.170> that<00:03:10.410> you<00:03:11.070> know<00:03:11.190> they've

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 
and they thought that you know they've

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:13.850 
and they thought that you know they've
got<00:03:11.790> 130<00:03:12.390> medications<00:03:12.959> to<00:03:13.080> choose<00:03:13.290> from<00:03:13.500> and

got 130 medications to choose from and

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:16.040 
got 130 medications to choose from and

no guidance on which will work for your

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:18.269 
particular brain so it's guesswork it is

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:19.640

trial and error that's the dominant
therapy<00:03:20.010> and<00:03:20.130> so<00:03:20.250> instead<00:03:20.550> of<00:03:20.610> guessing<00:03:20.880> they

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450
