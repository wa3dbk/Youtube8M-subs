00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.789
 wv 

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:28.979
 we must do the following count the 

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:31.079
 rings and jump them in the order 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:35.230
 specific as you see this is the first 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:38.610
 the number 4 we jump 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:40.980
 and then we'll have to go to number 6 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.050
 remember this you should always do and 

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:45.690
 when when they kill the prophet of the 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:49.190
 truth is already dead and the fruits and the 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:53.290
 parasite be your enemy again good 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:57.540
 we come to 6 we jump 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:57.540
 well we go back again 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:10.950
 and now we will jump on number 5 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.750
 5 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:19.240
 we follow 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:22.030
 and we jump again at number 4 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:27.660
 is the one that was destroyed in halo combat 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:27.660
 evolved we go back to 5 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:38.160
 we followed and we returned to number 3 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.310
 well we jumped 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:55.530
 we came back and finally number 4 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:04.760
 and as you see the rings will begin to 

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:06.880
 illuminate that means that the 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:09.250
 skull has been activated 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:12.340
 satisfactorily 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:14.560
 are activated from 1 to 7 and 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:17.319
 we will have to return 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:20.940
 to the place where the prophet of the 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:20.940
 truth or where he killed the inquisitor 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:27.930
 I recommend doing this when the blood 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:29.680
 they are dead then kill the 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:33.750
 first 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:33.750
 as you see there is our skull
