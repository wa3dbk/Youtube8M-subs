00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:07.250
 Pokemon Tretta version of the book is well encouraged 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:12.990
 Early Summer 2013 5 

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:14.490
 I have a fanbook rookie dresser attached in the appendix every time . 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.540
 this time 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.700
 Recording 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.310
 Here a 

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:21.160
 It is Rior 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:24.150
 cute 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:25.440
 9 types of 40 fighting types 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.539
 There is a skill 

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:29.110
 Take 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:30.980
 63 hit points 

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:33.630
 These 50 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:35.450
 41 was done 55 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.910
 Special or 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:44.440
 I'm not even strong, though 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:45.890
 It's with a privilege not many Torretta also it is was taken now 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.900
 This is it 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:49.360
 Use the report 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:51.239
 This using chopsticks 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:56.250
 It is to play 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:58.910
 And I want to say and point to redeem the result screen comes out 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.930
 That 's what the animal looks like 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:05.980
 By apparently do next large log 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:12.160
 It looks like a voucher that something good happens 

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:14.130
 It has not yet been written in detail by people about what you can get or whether something good happens 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:16.909
 but 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.810
 I went to hear that there is a good thing something 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:24.649
 Because I can not go for relief 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:24.649
 I want to use this to get a play interview 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:29.080
 the same 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:32.560
 You are here in two countries 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:35.930
 It's Hanbok special made, but it's Tretta Space 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:37.640
 It looks like the third part of system mathematics 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:38.600
 Is it Torretta ? 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.360
 Three 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:44.720
 You are supposed to enter 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:46.750
 It's a bird in the gap 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:46.750
 Oh 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:58.760
 It feels like 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:03.010
 There is a hole in the 3 pieces of decommissioning furnace . 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:03.010
 If you can do the day and hang it on your neck 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:08.520
 It is a back that looks like they sell 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:12.310
 There is also 1 for the Torretta Report 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.540
 It has become 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:24.400
 Re Toka you put in here, be sure to three that caught against them because I want to catch an empty seat 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:28.140
 Favorite Pokemon 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.140
 If you put 3 bodies 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:34.360
 Toletta is 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:34.360
 I think it is your sense 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:39.090
 The Ru use this time 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:45.910
 Good thing happens in the sixth 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:48.270
 Benefits also be referred to as the amount of blood 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:50.180
 When to use this 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:52.800
 Right now 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:57.110
 It is this time 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:57.110
