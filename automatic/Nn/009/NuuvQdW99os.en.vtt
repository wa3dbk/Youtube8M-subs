00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:07.620
 What is the weather condition for 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.000
 next 15 days all over Brazil in 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.910
 which areas should expect more rain 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.040
 what areas does air subsidence go 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.049
 and will prevent the formation of 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.840
 clouds loaded in which areas I 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:21.750
 I still have strong rain showers in the 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.250
 15 days map here we have those 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.590
 green tones on showing the region 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.840
 north northern region northeastern still 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.390
 with plenty of rain 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.520
 accumulated 200 millimeters as well as 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.649
 areas of the central-western region of brazil 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.290
 also from são paulo triangle region 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:40.230
 mine -center-south and mines-general 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.910
 also and also the whole state there of the river 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.770
 of January beyond the center of 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.860
 holy spirit where the accumulated 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.059
 can reach up to 150 millimeters in 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.800
 next 15 days 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.989
 areas of santa catarina in the 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.879
 also with large volumes of 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.070
 accumulated rain only we have to 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.559
 remember that much of this rain is already going 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:01.440
 happen next weekend or 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:04.350
 until the 30th are expected from the order of 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.689
 150 to 200 mm in some areas 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.280
 Parana region of the western center 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.180
 in the north central region 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.740
 Santa Catarina 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.229
 also from the east side of são paulo 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.270
 and from the southern region the São Paulo team 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.340
 must have accumulated rain in the order of 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.380
 hundred millimeters in this period to the day 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.360
 30 there also have large volumes of 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.790
 rainfall over areas of mato grosso in these 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.640
 shades of green as well as areas of the west 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:29.220
 of goiás and the north center also goiano 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.110
 northern brazil and northern areas 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.210
 still with the presence of 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.820
 many instabilities coming from the 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.020
 ocean and favoring large shot 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.909
 clouds loaded 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.860
 the great northern river is already beginning to 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:43.170
 a very low air subsistence condition 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.670
 more present and Christmas should no longer have 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.770
 so much rain there 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.810
 throughout this period exactly as 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.820
 area of ​​the northeastern east 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.610
 accumulated rainfall should not reach 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.200
 to 30 mm accumulated until the 4th 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.939
 what we should have 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.560
 we must again have areas of the 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:00.450
 south-central brazil arriving 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.979
 these shades of orange are taking the 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.840
 paulo getting south of brazil 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:05.549
 taking mato grosso do sul 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.469
 I should not have a passing frequency 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:10.020
 cold fronts but we should have 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:12.750
 a condition of instability brought 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.100
 exit to north-central areas 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.840
 network 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.880
 in general mines, especially areas 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.310
 where the volumes of 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.960
 rain reaches the age of 70 to 150 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:23.300
 millimeters accumulated 

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:25.400
 as well as areas of holy spirit still 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:27.740
 should rain a little more on areas of 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.810
 region of mato grosso north central 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:31.550
 goiás and even in the region of brasília 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:33.260
 in the federal district 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:35.240
 the rain volumes also return to 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:37.490
 decrease over areas of the north coast 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:39.590
 Northeastern showing that I no longer have 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:42.880
 a frequency so present from my 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.880
 zone of intertropical convergence
