speed<00:01:52.560> it<00:01:52.799> was<00:01:52.920> just<00:01:53.189> so<00:01:53.369> much<00:01:53.490> easier<00:01:53.880> to

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:53.930 
speed it was just so much easier to

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:56.270 
speed it was just so much easier to
sprint<00:01:54.930> to<00:01:54.960> the<00:01:55.049> by<00:01:55.290> line<00:01:55.500> and<00:01:55.740> cross<00:01:55.950> it<00:01:56.159> in

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
sprint to the by line and cross it in

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.810 
sprint to the by line and cross it in
which<00:01:56.579> is<00:01:56.820> kind<00:01:57.299> of<00:01:57.479> sweaty<00:01:57.719> I<00:01:57.810> suppose<00:01:58.259> but<00:01:59.219> if

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
which is kind of sweaty I suppose but if

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.780 
which is kind of sweaty I suppose but if
you<00:02:00.270> really<00:02:00.600> want<00:02:00.750> to<00:02:00.869> win<00:02:01.140> or<00:02:01.430> if<00:02:02.430> you<00:02:02.579> want<00:02:02.729> to

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
you really want to win or if you want to

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.609 
you really want to win or if you want to
take<00:02:02.939> advantage<00:02:03.060> of<00:02:03.450> a<00:02:03.540> target<00:02:03.930> man<00:02:04.049> such<00:02:04.439> as

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
take advantage of a target man such as

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.520 
take advantage of a target man such as
ibrahimovic<00:02:05.460> or<00:02:05.759> Gomez<00:02:06.329> or<00:02:06.509> Huntelaar<00:02:06.960> then

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
ibrahimovic or Gomez or Huntelaar then

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.040 
ibrahimovic or Gomez or Huntelaar then
this<00:02:07.740> guy<00:02:07.920> is<00:02:07.979> your<00:02:08.429> man<00:02:08.610> I<00:02:08.879> didn't<00:02:09.690> find<00:02:09.869> it

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
shooting to be all that impressive

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:15.420 
shooting to be all that impressive
so<00:02:12.670> many<00:02:12.880> goals<00:02:13.120> for<00:02:13.360> me<00:02:13.480> and<00:02:13.990> his<00:02:14.430> dribbling

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
so many goals for me and his dribbling

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:17.220 
so many goals for me and his dribbling
isn't<00:02:15.790> particularly<00:02:16.180> good<00:02:16.540> either<00:02:16.750> he's<00:02:17.080> got

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
isn't particularly good either he's got

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.350 
isn't particularly good either he's got
the<00:02:17.380> speed<00:02:17.680> reporter<00:02:18.040> trade<00:02:18.310> but<00:02:18.520> he's<00:02:19.210> got

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
the speed reporter trade but he's got

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.620 
the speed reporter trade but he's got
very<00:02:19.540> nice<00:02:19.690> free-kick<00:02:20.110> stats<00:02:20.500> 98<00:02:21.100> curve<00:02:21.630> 90

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
very nice free-kick stats 98 curve 90

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:25.890 
very nice free-kick stats 98 curve 90
free<00:02:22.930> kick<00:02:23.110> accuracy<00:02:23.790> 99<00:02:24.790> Schaffer<00:02:25.240> but<00:02:25.630> I

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
free kick accuracy 99 Schaffer but I

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.230 
free kick accuracy 99 Schaffer but I
didn't<00:02:26.230> unfortunately<00:02:26.800> get<00:02:26.950> to<00:02:27.160> take<00:02:28.000> any

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:28.240 
didn't unfortunately get to take any

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:30.480 
didn't unfortunately get to take any
free<00:02:28.510> kicks<00:02:28.720> with<00:02:28.900> him<00:02:29.080> but<00:02:29.980> yeah<00:02:30.190> I<00:02:30.220> would

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:30.490 
free kicks with him but yeah I would

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:32.040 
free kicks with him but yeah I would
definitely<00:02:30.790> recommend<00:02:30.850> playing<00:02:31.300> this<00:02:31.510> guy<00:02:31.750> as

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.050 
definitely recommend playing this guy as

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:34.140 
definitely recommend playing this guy as
a<00:02:32.440> wide<00:02:32.830> right<00:02:33.160> winger<00:02:33.430> you<00:02:33.760> know<00:02:33.880> it<00:02:34.000> like<00:02:34.120> a

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
a wide right winger you know it like a

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.110 
a wide right winger you know it like a
4-3-3<00:02:34.720> for<00:02:35.170> example<00:02:35.650> the<00:02:35.980> kind<00:02:36.160> of<00:02:36.250> in<00:02:36.460> a<00:02:36.640> 4-3

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
4-3-3 for example the kind of in a 4-3

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:38.670 
4-3-3 for example the kind of in a 4-3
to<00:02:37.150> one<00:02:37.420> I<00:02:37.450> just<00:02:37.570> don't<00:02:37.960> think<00:02:38.200> he's<00:02:38.380> the<00:02:38.530> best

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
to one I just don't think he's the best

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.160 
to one I just don't think he's the best
option<00:02:39.160> that<00:02:39.340> right<00:02:40.000> wing<00:02:40.180> unless<00:02:40.990> you're

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
option that right wing unless you're

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:42.990 
option that right wing unless you're
going<00:02:41.320> for<00:02:41.440> a<00:02:41.560> Polish<00:02:42.010> team<00:02:42.190> then<00:02:42.400> he<00:02:42.580> may<00:02:42.760> be<00:02:42.820> I

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
going for a Polish team then he may be I

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.370 
going for a Polish team then he may be I
don't<00:02:43.210> really<00:02:43.510> know<00:02:43.630> much<00:02:43.840> about<00:02:43.900> Polish

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:44.380 
don't really know much about Polish

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:47.100 
don't really know much about Polish
teams<00:02:44.590> but<00:02:45.280> in<00:02:45.610> the<00:02:45.730> liga<00:02:45.880> BBVA<00:02:46.000> for<00:02:46.810> about<00:02:46.960> the

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110 
teams but in the liga BBVA for about the

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:48.390 
teams but in the liga BBVA for about the
same<00:02:47.140> price<00:02:47.320> i<00:02:47.710> think<00:02:47.770> the<00:02:48.040> team<00:02:48.190> of<00:02:48.310> the<00:02:48.370> year

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
same price i think the team of the year

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.100 
same price i think the team of the year
fire<00:02:48.670> fan<00:02:48.880> is<00:02:49.030> definitely<00:02:49.360> better<00:02:49.510> at

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110 
fire fan is definitely better at

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:52.620 
fire fan is definitely better at
shooting<00:02:50.880> so<00:02:51.880> yeah<00:02:52.030> i'm<00:02:52.150> gonna<00:02:52.300> move<00:02:52.420> on<00:02:52.600> to

shooting so yeah i'm gonna move on to
the<00:02:52.810> work<00:02:52.960> now<00:02:53.110> i'm<00:02:53.230> gonna<00:02:53.350> give<00:02:53.530> this<00:02:53.650> guy<00:02:53.740> an

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
the work now i'm gonna give this guy an

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:56.820 
the work now i'm gonna give this guy an

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:56.830 
8.5 out of 10 that's if you play him as

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:58.350 
8.5 out of 10 that's if you play him as
a<00:02:56.860> wide<00:02:57.190> right<00:02:57.490> winger<00:02:57.820> who's<00:02:57.970> gonna<00:02:58.120> be

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:58.360 
a wide right winger who's gonna be

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.690 
a wide right winger who's gonna be
swinging<00:02:58.600> he<00:02:58.840> crosses<00:02:59.080> and<00:02:59.380> stuff<00:02:59.590> because<00:03:00.430> he

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
swinging he crosses and stuff because he

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.400 
swinging he crosses and stuff because he
is<00:03:00.820> very<00:03:00.970> good<00:03:01.210> at<00:03:01.330> crossing<00:03:01.570> he's<00:03:02.020> got<00:03:02.170> good

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:02.410 
is very good at crossing he's got good

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:05.010 
is very good at crossing he's got good
physical<00:03:03.370> stats<00:03:03.640> such<00:03:03.850> as<00:03:04.000> pace<00:03:04.240> and<00:03:04.510> strength

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:05.020 
physical stats such as pace and strength

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:07.260 
physical stats such as pace and strength
but<00:03:05.920> then<00:03:06.220> again<00:03:06.340> he's<00:03:06.610> not<00:03:06.790> the<00:03:06.910> best<00:03:07.090> at

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:07.270 
but then again he's not the best at

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:08.640 
but then again he's not the best at
dribbling<00:03:07.450> so<00:03:07.840> you<00:03:07.900> may<00:03:08.050> not<00:03:08.200> find<00:03:08.380> it<00:03:08.530> that

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
dribbling so you may not find it that

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:11.610 
dribbling so you may not find it that
easy<00:03:08.950> and<00:03:09.100> also<00:03:09.840> he's<00:03:10.840> only<00:03:11.050> got<00:03:11.200> three<00:03:11.410> start

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
easy and also he's only got three start

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:12.840 
easy and also he's only got three start
skills<00:03:11.860> and<00:03:12.040> three<00:03:12.190> start<00:03:12.400> weak<00:03:12.520> foot<00:03:12.700> which

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:12.850 
skills and three start weak foot which

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:16.110 
skills and three start weak foot which
are<00:03:13.630> both<00:03:13.840> kind<00:03:14.200> of<00:03:14.290> a<00:03:14.380> letdown<00:03:14.560> and<00:03:15.010> again<00:03:15.910> his

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 
are both kind of a letdown and again his

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.840 
are both kind of a letdown and again his
shooting<00:03:16.480> isn't<00:03:17.050> quite<00:03:17.350> up<00:03:18.310> to<00:03:18.370> what<00:03:18.670> i<00:03:18.700> would

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:18.850 
shooting isn't quite up to what i would

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:21.870 
shooting isn't quite up to what i would
expect<00:03:18.970> for<00:03:19.390> an<00:03:19.510> 85<00:03:19.930> on<00:03:20.350> the<00:03:20.470> card<00:03:20.680> stat<00:03:21.070> so<00:03:21.820> you

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:21.880 
expect for an 85 on the card stat so you

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:24.240 
expect for an 85 on the card stat so you
have<00:03:22.120> a<00:03:22.150> very<00:03:22.870> nice<00:03:23.050> wide<00:03:23.350> player<00:03:23.650> but<00:03:23.920> not<00:03:24.100> the

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.250 
have a very nice wide player but not the

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:27.060 
have a very nice wide player but not the
greatest<00:03:24.540> sort<00:03:25.540> of<00:03:25.630> insight<00:03:26.050> striker<00:03:26.380> i<00:03:26.680> hope

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:27.070 
greatest sort of insight striker i hope

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:28.920
