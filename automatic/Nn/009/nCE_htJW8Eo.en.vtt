and there we go we've got the upper D to
arms<00:02:08.380> as<00:02:08.560> well<00:02:08.770> as<00:02:08.860> the<00:02:08.979> head<00:02:09.780> and<00:02:10.780> put<00:02:10.989> the<00:02:11.080> two

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
arms as well as the head and put the two

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:12.990 
arms as well as the head and put the two
put<00:02:11.650> the<00:02:11.739> three<00:02:12.069> together<00:02:12.190> actually<00:02:12.580> and

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
put the three together actually and

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.870 
put the three together actually and
you've<00:02:13.300> got<00:02:13.480> yourself<00:02:13.810> a<00:02:14.580> interesting<00:02:15.580> little

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
you've got yourself a interesting little

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.990 
you've got yourself a interesting little
stack<00:02:16.390> card<00:02:16.780> certainly<00:02:17.380> something<00:02:18.000> makes

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
stack card certainly something makes

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.559 
stack card certainly something makes
this<00:02:19.180> base<00:02:19.390> a<00:02:19.420> little<00:02:19.690> more<00:02:19.989> interesting<00:02:20.470> and

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:21.569 
this base a little more interesting and

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:23.610 
this base a little more interesting and
despite<00:02:22.569> the<00:02:22.690> fact<00:02:22.930> that<00:02:23.020> this<00:02:23.200> isn't<00:02:23.530> the

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
despite the fact that this isn't the

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.380 
despite the fact that this isn't the
first<00:02:23.920> wave<00:02:24.220> that<00:02:24.250> we're<00:02:24.550> now<00:02:24.790> into<00:02:25.120> what

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
first wave that we're now into what

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:28.350 
first wave that we're now into what
several<00:02:25.720> waves<00:02:26.050> into<00:02:26.440> this<00:02:26.560> line<00:02:27.209> still<00:02:28.209> they

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
several waves into this line still they

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.210 
several waves into this line still they
have<00:02:28.480> yet<00:02:28.690> not<00:02:28.900> come<00:02:29.200> up<00:02:29.349> with<00:02:29.380> the<00:02:29.590> idea<00:02:29.890> of

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
have yet not come up with the idea of

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:31.979 
have yet not come up with the idea of
hey<00:02:30.520> let's<00:02:30.819> put<00:02:31.030> the<00:02:31.180> actual<00:02:31.540> name<00:02:31.780> of<00:02:31.810> the

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:31.989 
hey let's put the actual name of the

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:35.130 
hey let's put the actual name of the
figure<00:02:32.500> there<00:02:32.890> it's<00:02:33.610> right<00:02:33.909> there<00:02:34.269> guys<00:02:34.540> there

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140 
figure there it's right there guys there

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:38.520 
figure there it's right there guys there
is<00:02:35.290> a<00:02:35.319> spot<00:02:35.829> right<00:02:36.069> there<00:02:36.810> why<00:02:37.810> they<00:02:38.049> have<00:02:38.260> not

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
is a spot right there why they have not

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.809 
is a spot right there why they have not
you

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:38.819 
you

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:40.339 
you
I<00:02:38.849> don't<00:02:39.299> know<00:02:39.390> maybe<00:02:39.749> they<00:02:39.930> just<00:02:40.019> don't<00:02:40.170> want

00:02:40.339 --> 00:02:40.349 
I don't know maybe they just don't want

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:41.839 
I don't know maybe they just don't want
to<00:02:40.469> production-wise<00:02:41.040> maybe<00:02:41.459> they<00:02:41.549> just<00:02:41.730> don't

00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:41.849 
to production-wise maybe they just don't

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:44.449 
to production-wise maybe they just don't
want<00:02:41.969> to<00:02:41.999> bother<00:02:42.659> though<00:02:42.989> this<00:02:43.280> release<00:02:44.280> a

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
want to bother though this release a

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:48.619 
want to bother though this release a
generic<00:02:44.909> base<00:02:45.120> but<00:02:46.459> it'll<00:02:47.459> just<00:02:47.639> be<00:02:48.239> put<00:02:48.450> there

00:02:48.619 --> 00:02:48.629 
generic base but it'll just be put there

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:50.929 
generic base but it'll just be put there
for<00:02:48.659> a<00:02:48.870> second<00:02:49.249> let's<00:02:50.249> have<00:02:50.340> a<00:02:50.430> look<00:02:50.700> at

00:02:50.929 --> 00:02:50.939 
for a second let's have a look at

00:02:50.939 --> 00:02:53.059 
for a second let's have a look at
Hulkbuster<00:02:51.659> ironman<00:02:52.079> whoo<00:02:52.319> I<00:02:52.560> gotta<00:02:52.799> say

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:53.069 
Hulkbuster ironman whoo I gotta say

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:54.640 
Hulkbuster ironman whoo I gotta say
looks<00:02:53.340> awesome

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
looks awesome

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:57.709 
looks awesome
totally<00:02:55.650> awesome<00:02:55.859> I<00:02:56.340> feel<00:02:57.180> like<00:02:57.299> I'm<00:02:57.450> stuck<00:02:57.659> in

00:02:57.709 --> 00:02:57.719 
totally awesome I feel like I'm stuck in

00:02:57.719 --> 00:03:01.009 
totally awesome I feel like I'm stuck in
the<00:02:57.870> 80s<00:02:58.819> there<00:02:59.819> are<00:03:00.000> some<00:03:00.359> issues

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:01.019 
the 80s there are some issues

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:02.839 
the 80s there are some issues
there's<00:03:01.469> some<00:03:01.709> small<00:03:02.040> issues<00:03:02.430> with<00:03:02.760> the

00:03:02.839 --> 00:03:02.849 
there's some small issues with the

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:05.300 
there's some small issues with the
figure<00:03:03.200> probably<00:03:04.200> the<00:03:04.439> more<00:03:04.590> obvious<00:03:04.769> one<00:03:05.159> is

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
figure probably the more obvious one is

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.490 
figure probably the more obvious one is
the<00:03:05.430> fact<00:03:05.609> that<00:03:05.730> the<00:03:05.909> upper<00:03:06.269> torso<00:03:06.510> kind<00:03:07.439> of

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
the fact that the upper torso kind of

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.949 
the fact that the upper torso kind of
like<00:03:07.680> this<00:03:07.889> area<00:03:08.370> right<00:03:08.579> here<00:03:08.639> is<00:03:09.150> a<00:03:09.540> different

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959 
like this area right here is a different

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:12.979 
like this area right here is a different
color<00:03:10.169> than<00:03:10.590> the<00:03:10.620> head<00:03:11.159> the<00:03:11.849> arms<00:03:12.269> and<00:03:12.510> also

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:12.989 
color than the head the arms and also

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:18.679 
color than the head the arms and also
the<00:03:13.319> legs<00:03:15.560> not<00:03:16.560> really<00:03:16.769> sure<00:03:16.949> why<00:03:17.159> I<00:03:17.689> mean

00:03:18.679 --> 00:03:18.689 
the legs not really sure why I mean

00:03:18.689 --> 00:03:20.720 
the legs not really sure why I mean
obviously<00:03:18.810> the<00:03:19.199> I<00:03:19.560> think<00:03:19.889> the<00:03:19.980> better<00:03:20.400> color

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
obviously the I think the better color

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:22.459 
obviously the I think the better color
maybe<00:03:21.449> would<00:03:21.689> have<00:03:21.719> been<00:03:21.810> this<00:03:22.019> color<00:03:22.319> as

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:22.469 
maybe would have been this color as

00:03:22.469 --> 00:03:23.959 
maybe would have been this color as
opposed<00:03:22.769> to<00:03:22.829> the<00:03:22.949> other<00:03:23.099> colors<00:03:23.489> here<00:03:23.730> the

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:23.969 
opposed to the other colors here the

00:03:23.969 --> 00:03:26.629 
opposed to the other colors here the
that<00:03:24.480> more<00:03:24.689> Brown<00:03:25.129> rusted<00:03:26.129> color

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:26.639 
that more Brown rusted color

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:28.490 
that more Brown rusted color
I<00:03:26.669> think<00:03:27.209> I'm<00:03:27.299> prefer<00:03:27.930> this<00:03:28.109> coming<00:03:28.409> a<00:03:28.439> little

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
I think I'm prefer this coming a little

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.250 
I think I'm prefer this coming a little
bit<00:03:28.650> more<00:03:28.889> but<00:03:29.780> strange<00:03:30.780> that<00:03:30.959> it<00:03:31.079> really

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
bit more but strange that it really

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.020 
bit more but strange that it really
isn't<00:03:31.379> on<00:03:31.620> the<00:03:31.739> rest<00:03:31.919> of<00:03:31.980> the<00:03:32.069> figure<00:03:32.370> of

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
isn't on the rest of the figure of

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:34.520 
isn't on the rest of the figure of
course<00:03:33.239> is<00:03:33.359> well<00:03:33.510> we've<00:03:33.659> got<00:03:33.780> this<00:03:33.900> nice<00:03:34.079> gold

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
course is well we've got this nice gold

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.709 
course is well we've got this nice gold
in<00:03:34.829> there<00:03:35.010> as<00:03:35.129> well<00:03:35.370> but<00:03:36.000> the<00:03:36.150> silver<00:03:36.419> on<00:03:36.629> the

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:36.719 
in there as well but the silver on the

00:03:36.719 --> 00:03:38.479 
in there as well but the silver on the
back<00:03:36.900> of<00:03:37.079> his<00:03:37.280> exhaust

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:38.489 
back of his exhaust

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:42.979 
back of his exhaust
I<00:03:38.609> guess<00:03:38.760> exhaust<00:03:39.180> stacks<00:03:41.569> but<00:03:42.569> I<00:03:42.629> mean<00:03:42.840> the

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:42.989 
I guess exhaust stacks but I mean the

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:44.689 
I guess exhaust stacks but I mean the
figure<00:03:43.319> is<00:03:43.439> very<00:03:43.500> detailed<00:03:44.129> it's<00:03:44.489> a<00:03:44.549> very

00:03:44.689 --> 00:03:44.699 
figure is very detailed it's a very

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:47.119 
figure is very detailed it's a very
large<00:03:45.090> figure<00:03:45.509> as<00:03:45.629> well<00:03:45.769> I've<00:03:46.769> got<00:03:46.919> a<00:03:46.949> little

00:03:47.119 --> 00:03:47.129 
large figure as well I've got a little

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:49.309 
large figure as well I've got a little
bit<00:03:47.220> of<00:03:47.340> problem<00:03:48.090> with<00:03:48.239> my<00:03:48.419> one<00:03:48.659> wrist<00:03:48.989> here

not so much it's nice and stiff that's
why<00:04:00.030> I<00:04:00.060> like<00:04:00.269> it

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 
why I like it

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:06.619 
why I like it
in<00:04:03.060> the<00:04:03.209> way<00:04:03.299> of<00:04:03.419> his<00:04:03.599> articulation<00:04:05.329> you<00:04:06.329> can't

00:04:06.619 --> 00:04:06.629 
in the way of his articulation you can't

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:07.909 
in the way of his articulation you can't
actually<00:04:06.870> move<00:04:07.169> his<00:04:07.349> head<00:04:07.530> which<00:04:07.709> I<00:04:07.829> was

00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:07.919 
actually move his head which I was

00:04:07.919 --> 00:04:10.039 
actually move his head which I was
actually<00:04:08.189> surprised<00:04:08.790> you<00:04:09.419> can't<00:04:09.599> moved<00:04:09.750> a<00:04:09.840> lot

00:04:10.039 --> 00:04:10.049 
actually surprised you can't moved a lot

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:11.929 
actually surprised you can't moved a lot
granted<00:04:10.560> but<00:04:11.220> you<00:04:11.280> can't<00:04:11.519> move<00:04:11.639> it<00:04:11.819> a<00:04:11.909> little

00:04:11.929 --> 00:04:11.939 
granted but you can't move it a little

00:04:11.939 --> 00:04:15.170 
granted but you can't move it a little
bit<00:04:12.239> left<00:04:12.599> and<00:04:12.750> right<00:04:13.609> he's<00:04:14.609> got<00:04:14.790> shoulder

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180 
bit left and right he's got shoulder

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:19.279 
bit left and right he's got shoulder
articulation<00:04:16.099> like<00:04:17.099> so<00:04:17.479> you<00:04:18.479> can<00:04:18.659> rotate<00:04:18.870> the

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:19.289 
articulation like so you can rotate the

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:21.529 
articulation like so you can rotate the
forearms<00:04:19.949> all<00:04:20.579> the<00:04:20.759> way<00:04:20.849> around<00:04:21.120> you<00:04:21.299> can<00:04:21.329> also

00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:21.539 
forearms all the way around you can also

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:24.080 
forearms all the way around you can also
bend<00:04:21.900> at<00:04:22.049> the<00:04:22.079> elbow<00:04:22.440> and<00:04:22.669> of<00:04:23.669> course<00:04:23.909> as

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:24.090 
bend at the elbow and of course as

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:25.820 
bend at the elbow and of course as
mentioned<00:04:24.330> you<00:04:24.539> can<00:04:24.719> rotate<00:04:24.870> the<00:04:25.199> wrist<00:04:25.409> very

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:25.830 
mentioned you can rotate the wrist very

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:30.310 
mentioned you can rotate the wrist very
loose<00:04:26.070> on<00:04:26.430> the<00:04:26.639> one<00:04:26.789> side<00:04:27.120> a<00:04:27.620> bit<00:04:28.620> of<00:04:28.710> a<00:04:28.770> shame

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:30.320 
loose on the one side a bit of a shame

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:32.600 
loose on the one side a bit of a shame
of<00:04:31.320> course<00:04:31.409> same<00:04:31.800> on<00:04:31.919> the<00:04:32.009> other<00:04:32.039> side<00:04:32.400> there

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:32.610 
of course same on the other side there

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:35.749 
of course same on the other side there
as<00:04:32.699> well<00:04:33.620> he's<00:04:34.620> got<00:04:34.770> this<00:04:34.889> really<00:04:35.099> nice<00:04:35.340> ball

00:04:35.749 --> 00:04:35.759 
as well he's got this really nice ball

00:04:35.759 --> 00:04:37.850 
as well he's got this really nice ball
joint<00:04:36.210> he's<00:04:36.449> a<00:04:36.479> ball<00:04:36.960> jointed<00:04:37.349> upper<00:04:37.620> torso

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:37.860 
joint he's a ball jointed upper torso

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:39.140 
joint he's a ball jointed upper torso
which<00:04:38.219> allows<00:04:38.520> you<00:04:38.639> to<00:04:38.729> get<00:04:38.849> a<00:04:38.909> lot<00:04:39.120> of

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:39.150 
which allows you to get a lot of

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:42.529 
which allows you to get a lot of
movement<00:04:39.479> with<00:04:39.840> him<00:04:40.639> of<00:04:41.639> course<00:04:41.849> no<00:04:42.090> waist

00:04:42.529 --> 00:04:42.539 
movement with him of course no waist

00:04:42.539 --> 00:04:45.709 
movement with him of course no waist
articulation<00:04:43.310> but<00:04:44.310> his<00:04:44.430> legs<00:04:44.639> can<00:04:45.000> bend<00:04:45.300> out

00:04:45.709 --> 00:04:45.719 
articulation but his legs can bend out

00:04:45.719 --> 00:04:48.950 
articulation but his legs can bend out
and<00:04:46.349> back<00:04:46.500> and<00:04:46.650> forth<00:04:46.949> in<00:04:47.159> and<00:04:47.310> out<00:04:47.840> you<00:04:48.840> can

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:48.960 
and back and forth in and out you can

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:50.810 
and back and forth in and out you can
also<00:04:49.080> rotate<00:04:49.380> the<00:04:49.740> thigh<00:04:49.949> bend<00:04:50.430> at<00:04:50.580> the<00:04:50.610> knee

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:50.820 
also rotate the thigh bend at the knee

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:52.250 
also rotate the thigh bend at the knee
at<00:04:50.940> two<00:04:51.120> points<00:04:51.570> you<00:04:52.050> can

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:52.260 
at two points you can

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:56.420 
at two points you can
seeing<00:04:52.470> right<00:04:52.680> there<00:04:53.390> also<00:04:55.130> you<00:04:56.130> can<00:04:56.280> rotate

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:56.430 
seeing right there also you can rotate

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:58.490 
seeing right there also you can rotate
at<00:04:56.790> the<00:04:56.940> foot<00:04:57.240> doesn't<00:04:57.930> look<00:04:58.140> like<00:04:58.290> you<00:04:58.380> can

00:04:58.490 --> 00:04:58.500 
at the foot doesn't look like you can

00:04:58.500 --> 00:04:59.960 
at the foot doesn't look like you can
actually<00:04:58.650> bend<00:04:58.950> the<00:04:59.040> foot<00:04:59.220> up<00:04:59.340> and<00:04:59.490> down<00:04:59.640> but

00:04:59.960 --> 00:04:59.970 
actually bend the foot up and down but

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:01.490 
actually bend the foot up and down but
you<00:05:00.060> can<00:05:00.180> certainly<00:05:00.360> rotate<00:05:00.870> it<00:05:00.990> left<00:05:01.260> and

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:01.500 
you can certainly rotate it left and

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:04.880 
you can certainly rotate it left and
right<00:05:02.690> getting<00:05:03.690> in<00:05:03.810> certain<00:05:04.560> certainly

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:04.890 
right getting in certain certainly

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:07.210 
right getting in certain certainly
different<00:05:05.310> poses<00:05:05.520> it's<00:05:05.910> not<00:05:06.150> a<00:05:06.180> problem

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:07.220 
different poses it's not a problem

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:09.290 
different poses it's not a problem
that's<00:05:08.220> actually<00:05:08.640> a<00:05:08.670> pretty<00:05:08.790> good<00:05:08.910> poles

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:09.300 
that's actually a pretty good poles

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:11.180 
that's actually a pretty good poles
right<00:05:09.510> there

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:11.190 
right there

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:13.820 
right there
I<00:05:11.220> don't<00:05:12.000> know<00:05:12.090> that<00:05:12.990> depending<00:05:13.500> on<00:05:13.620> how<00:05:13.770> you

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:13.830 
I don't know that depending on how you

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:15.920 
I don't know that depending on how you
prefer<00:05:14.160> it<00:05:14.400> you<00:05:15.030> can<00:05:15.150> certainly<00:05:15.360> put<00:05:15.540> him<00:05:15.810> on

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:15.930 
prefer it you can certainly put him on

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:20.000 
prefer it you can certainly put him on
his<00:05:16.050> displaced<00:05:16.500> and<00:05:17.090> now<00:05:18.090> granted<00:05:18.810> his<00:05:19.010> for

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:20.010 
his displaced and now granted his for

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:20.840 
his displaced and now granted his for
how<00:05:20.100> big<00:05:20.400> he<00:05:20.610> is

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:20.850 
how big he is

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:22.790 
how big he is
I<00:05:21.120> don't<00:05:21.870> know<00:05:21.960> putting<00:05:22.380> them<00:05:22.530> in<00:05:22.620> on<00:05:22.770> a

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:22.800 
I don't know putting them in on a

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:24.440 
I don't know putting them in on a
display<00:05:23.280> stand<00:05:23.340> first<00:05:23.820> of<00:05:23.970> all<00:05:24.030> his<00:05:24.270> might

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:24.450 
display stand first of all his might

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:26.390 
display stand first of all his might
probably<00:05:24.750> not<00:05:24.870> the<00:05:24.990> easiest<00:05:25.020> thing<00:05:25.500> to<00:05:25.530> do<00:05:25.740> but

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:26.400 
probably not the easiest thing to do but

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:27.770 
probably not the easiest thing to do but
when<00:05:26.550> you<00:05:26.610> get<00:05:26.730> on<00:05:26.940> it<00:05:27.030> it<00:05:27.360> might<00:05:27.570> actually

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:27.780 
when you get on it it might actually

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:30.920 
when you get on it it might actually
look<00:05:28.170> a<00:05:28.290> little<00:05:28.560> too<00:05:28.740> large<00:05:29.040> I<00:05:29.810> panned<00:05:30.810> down

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:30.930 
look a little too large I panned down

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:33.170 
look a little too large I panned down
there<00:05:31.200> for<00:05:31.380> a<00:05:31.410> second<00:05:31.740> I<00:05:31.890> feel<00:05:32.760> a<00:05:32.820> little<00:05:32.970> too

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:33.180 
there for a second I feel a little too

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:36.260 
there for a second I feel a little too
large<00:05:33.420> to<00:05:33.600> actually<00:05:33.840> put<00:05:33.990> on<00:05:34.140> a<00:05:34.170> display<00:05:35.270> so

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:36.270 
large to actually put on a display so

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:37.660 
large to actually put on a display so
maybe<00:05:36.510> it<00:05:36.690> might<00:05:36.840> be<00:05:36.930> the<00:05:37.050> kind<00:05:37.230> of<00:05:37.290> thing<00:05:37.440> like

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:37.670 
maybe it might be the kind of thing like

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:40.490 
maybe it might be the kind of thing like
ironmonger<00:05:38.670> if<00:05:39.390> you<00:05:39.570> have<00:05:39.720> an<00:05:39.870> ironmonger

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:40.500 
ironmonger if you have an ironmonger

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:42.410 
ironmonger if you have an ironmonger
where<00:05:41.130> you<00:05:41.460> probably<00:05:41.820> would<00:05:42.030> want<00:05:42.060> to<00:05:42.300> keep

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:42.420 
where you probably would want to keep

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:46.040 
where you probably would want to keep
the<00:05:42.600> figure<00:05:42.870> maybe<00:05:43.050> just<00:05:43.350> off<00:05:43.530> the<00:05:43.710> base<00:05:44.810> but<00:05:45.810> I

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:46.050 
the figure maybe just off the base but I

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:47.540 
the figure maybe just off the base but I
mean<00:05:46.230> it<00:05:46.320> still<00:05:46.560> manages<00:05:46.890> us<00:05:47.040> to<00:05:47.160> get<00:05:47.280> on<00:05:47.370> there

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:47.550 
mean it still manages us to get on there

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:49.420 
mean it still manages us to get on there
pretty<00:05:47.790> fine<00:05:48.120> and<00:05:48.420> you've<00:05:48.780> still<00:05:48.990> got<00:05:49.170> the

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:49.430 
pretty fine and you've still got the

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:51.770 
pretty fine and you've still got the
interesting<00:05:50.430> little<00:05:50.820> stack<00:05:51.240> card<00:05:51.570> at<00:05:51.690> the

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:51.780 
interesting little stack card at the
