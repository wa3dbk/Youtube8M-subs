00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:14.390
 hello everybody i'm giancarlo del canal 

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:16.309
 photoshop 

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:19.340
 In this video lesson, I'll show you. 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:20.660
 how to enrich and improve the contrast 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:23.600
 of photos 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:25.340
 I already have an open photograph and 

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.350
 first thing I 'm going to do is create a 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:29.990
 duplicate so that we can make a 

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:32.780
 comparative before and after I came 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:39.650
 here in duplicate rhymes and I'll give the name 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:42.580
 shock treatment 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:44.870
 I already have her copy created here 

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:48.140
 and the first thing I'll do will 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:51.430
 working with a layer of adjustments 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:54.409
 call selective col or selective color 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:57.170
 this setting you can work the 

00:00:54.409 --> 00:00:58.760
 channels individually and first I'll 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:04.699
 work the red channel or 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:09.290
 increase a few values ​​of cyan 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:13.640
 yellow and black magenta good 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:15.470
 also move on the channel she makes 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:21.230
 The same thing commented a little 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:23.830
 here I will do the same thing in the 

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:23.830
 green channel 

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:33.740
 and I'm going to play the blue channel too 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:36.530
 because there's a little heaven here I want 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:39.950
 highlight a little too, I'll make the 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:42.440
 same interesting thing so do not 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:46.220
 values ​​are too high because I do not 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:48.980
 I want to force the update a lot 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:50.360
 using this adjustment layer with 

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:53.300
 selective 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:57.110
 as you can see here, the change 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:59.450
 It was soft, because I want to do this. 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:01.700
 change this recognition using the 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.950
 ldu lap so that we will now see 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:06.410
 I'm going to right click here on the 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:09.910
 adjustment layer and I will choose mashtal 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:13.100
 to merge the two layers 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:17.650
 now I'm going to give an image to the 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:20.780
 module color blocking mas world ldu lap 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:24.290
 and I'll make the adjustment using the 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:26.990
 curves it when you open it 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:30.560
 the judge curves in the mode ldu lap her account 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:31.460
 Bilac with three options on the channel A &amp; E 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.209
 channel b 

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:37.850
 I'm going to work the channel first. 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:41.480
 and I will configure the following 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:43.700
 form if your grid and adjustment layer 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:46.400
 do not have it that way, just you 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:48.709
 press the alt key she will do 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.600
 the change to four or ten 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:51.440
 squares as you can is 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.360
 observing 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:57.830
 I'd rather work that way because 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:59.720
 You have a fit but it 's home right. 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:01.940
 It is easier for you to finish each 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:04.160
 value because every square in this one 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:07.489
 corresponds to 10% of the image 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:09.340
 I 'm here on the channel dragging a 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:12.530
 little slider to the right 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:15.170
 little little beyond the first 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:17.090
 square comes up here does the same 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:20.290
 thing 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:24.350
 Look how things are getting better. 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:29.090
 nephasth the same thing here on channel b 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:31.960
 it will enhance quite yourself 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:35.080
 thing that in the upper part 

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:37.030
 and I came here to finish coming on the channel 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:39.810
 online chinese I'll make that curve in 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:44.110
 s that we are accustomed to doing 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:45.400
 I created three dots here and I will 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:48.520
 drag the first job a little 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:52.330
 down and up here drag a 

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:55.750
 some for up just as well soft 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:57.640
 Look, the difference here already has a 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:00.250
 photo ne 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:02.980
 I'm going to close the window and I'll click with the 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:05.950
 right choose mashtal again 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:08.290
 to merge the two layers and 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:10.360
 now I come back here I want to transform 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:15.090
 my picture and rgb again 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:17.590
 I have here on magnets rgb tail template 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:19.450
 already converted back to 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:21.970
 We're going to make a 

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:25.030
 comparative of the year after I'll put 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:28.240
 here the two images there on the power side 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:28.990
 copy the layer for us to do 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:31.300
 Comparation 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:35.440
 I'll press the shift key and go 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:38.380
 drag layer up from original 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:42.280
 I can close here I will not save 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:45.430
 Look at the before and after 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:46.840
 before and after that part of the sheet that 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:49.240
 I was bothered with this part 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:50.260
 Ripper here leaving the picture. 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:52.780
 ugly, right 

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:55.750
 I'll get my cutting tool and 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:57.340
 I'll make a cut to be able to improve 

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:58.660
 this part here that does not want me to 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:03.780
 showed ripped 

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:06.760
 It's an ugly thing, not a little bit more. 

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:07.840
 press enter and my photo 

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:12.850
 is ready 

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:16.150
 see only is the before before or before 

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:18.640
 then some staff is a way 

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:20.800
 extremely simple to you improve and 

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:22.630
 enriching the choreography 

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:23.980
 Then you will not spend even five minutes. 

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:26.290
 to do this 

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:29.280
