00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:04.510
 good so androids in this video we're going 

00:00:02.409 --> 00:00:06.820
 to see once and for all how to save 

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:08.760
 real battery in the tsja or look at my 

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:11.550
 1s 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:14.070
 in part this tutorial is what I could 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.630
 thank the user uac the htc 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.540
 Mania is still very thankful because 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.640
 france be your comment we could see 

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:23.880
 how you could set the frequency 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:26.970
 minimum in this terminal since the room 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.800
 by default it does not leave if it is not 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.560
 select one of the characteristics of 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.910
 nothing or feels cpu control so 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.760
 well the first thing we have to do 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.830
 is download of the story not freeze 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.080
 cpu control and once it has 

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:42.000
 installed let's access the 

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:45.690
 application 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.560
 we go directly to the settings menu and 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:52.350
 we select the third option that is 

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:54.390
 denom is explained as not allow 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.970
 changes by the system or other 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:00.200
 applications so we do not give that 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:03.430
 option we give to ok 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:07.280
 and the rest is configured as you want 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:10.550
 if you want good deactivate the valve 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:13.100
 of security in order to include the dream 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:15.230
 deep update the current frequency 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:17.720
 that as you want but for it to work 

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:19.370
 to be able to set the frequency 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.780
 minimum in the main chair in my 1 that 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:22.700
 we have to activate the option not 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:25.250
 allow changes by the system or 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:27.200
 from another application once this is done 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:29.150
 we go back to the main menu and 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:33.050
 we select as maximum frequency 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:35.090
 well over I have chosen 1 with 19 is 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:37.610
 say 1 with 2 gigahertz 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:41.180
 you can also choose 1 with 3 that as 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:43.580
 you see as good if you need the 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:46.280
 processor works not with 3 choose either 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:48.619
 one with 3 yo 1 with 19 works pretty 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:52.070
 well and in iphone type games then it 

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:54.079
 execute well I have no problem and 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:56.790
 in minimum frequency 

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:58.409
 we selected 300 megahertz for 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.350
 when at rest consume less 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:04.049
 battery no less battery not in the 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:06.299
 processor frequency work more 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:09.630
 slow and therefore consume less battery 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:12.360
 in theme governor and planner I've 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:14.459
 been testing several governors and 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.860
 planners and with those who better 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:19.140
 results obtained has been with a theme 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:22.110
 nor did I effect if you see that 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.970
 other governors and planners 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:26.459
 you get better results that is 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:30.030
 longer battery life comment melo 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:32.549
 and well I'll make another video or I'll put it in 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:35.220
 the description section so good 

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:36.630
 what is said if you see that others plan 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:39.239
 the governors works better than 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:42.180
 December we click on apply to 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:44.930
 boot and once this is done we press 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.930
 in applying 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:51.680
 and we left 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:51.680
 and restart the smartphone 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:58.740
 and it's done once we've started 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:00.390
 on our friend's smartphone 

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:03.060
 finished that work at a frequency 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:05.670
 minimum of 13 pardon 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:07.860
 minimum of 300 megahertz and maximum 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:10.620
 good of what you have chosen in this 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:12.780
 case to 1 with 2 gigahertz so good 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:14.610
 I have done it if you have any doubt leave 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.440
 in the comments section and good if 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:20.690
 you liked the video has been useful 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:20.690
 you can give it a like share and come
