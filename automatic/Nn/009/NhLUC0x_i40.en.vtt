00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:16.040 
so let's look at how to connect a Canon

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:19.300 
so let's look at how to connect a Canon
EOS<00:00:16.160> lens<00:00:16.670> or<00:00:16.939> the<00:00:16.970> Fuji<00:00:17.420> x-pro<00:00:17.750> 1<00:00:17.960> the<00:00:18.890> problem

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:19.310 
EOS lens or the Fuji x-pro 1 the problem

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:21.040 
EOS lens or the Fuji x-pro 1 the problem
with<00:00:19.430> the<00:00:19.520> Fuji<00:00:19.730> x-pro<00:00:20.090> 1<00:00:20.240> lenses<00:00:20.869> is<00:00:21.020> that

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:21.050 
with the Fuji x-pro 1 lenses is that

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:23.229 
with the Fuji x-pro 1 lenses is that
right<00:00:21.470> now<00:00:21.680> there<00:00:21.860> are<00:00:21.950> about<00:00:22.040> four<00:00:22.910> or<00:00:22.939> five

00:00:23.229 --> 00:00:23.239 
right now there are about four or five

00:00:23.239 --> 00:00:25.359 
right now there are about four or five
lenses<00:00:23.480> which<00:00:23.810> have<00:00:23.930> been<00:00:24.079> released<00:00:24.230> and<00:00:24.680> what

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:25.369 
lenses which have been released and what

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:29.799 
lenses which have been released and what
is<00:00:25.489> lacking<00:00:25.790> there<00:00:26.239> is<00:00:26.599> a<00:00:27.259> good<00:00:28.180> portrait<00:00:29.180> lens

00:00:29.799 --> 00:00:29.809 
is lacking there is a good portrait lens

00:00:29.809 --> 00:00:36.880 
is lacking there is a good portrait lens
they're<00:00:30.649> scheduled<00:00:31.489> to<00:00:33.460> release<00:00:34.460> a<00:00:34.880> 56<00:00:35.570> mm<00:00:35.899> 1.4

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:36.890 
they're scheduled to release a 56 mm 1.4

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:39.520 
they're scheduled to release a 56 mm 1.4
which<00:00:37.280> on<00:00:37.640> this<00:00:37.940> crop<00:00:38.660> sensor<00:00:39.080> would<00:00:39.200> be<00:00:39.350> about

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:39.530 
which on this crop sensor would be about

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:44.080 
which on this crop sensor would be about
85mm<00:00:40.220> 1.4<00:00:40.430> but<00:00:41.440> currently<00:00:42.610> you<00:00:43.610> don't<00:00:43.820> have

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:44.090 
85mm 1.4 but currently you don't have

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:47.590 
85mm 1.4 but currently you don't have
anything<00:00:44.360> which<00:00:44.690> is<00:00:44.870> of<00:00:45.020> the<00:00:45.140> 85<00:00:45.560> 200<00:00:46.330> mm<00:00:47.330> range

anything which is of the 85 200 mm range

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.510 
anything which is of the 85 200 mm range
so<00:00:48.170> so<00:00:48.560> that<00:00:48.710> was<00:00:48.890> the<00:00:48.980> challenge<00:00:49.160> I<00:00:49.400> was

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:49.520 
so so that was the challenge I was

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.120 
so so that was the challenge I was
having<00:00:49.880> all<00:00:50.030> the<00:00:50.180> time<00:00:50.500> you<00:00:51.500> know<00:00:51.620> to<00:00:51.890> trick

what I did and if you can see just

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:01.180 
what I did and if you can see just
behind<00:00:58.370> the<00:00:58.579> camera<00:00:58.970> I<00:00:59.180> have<00:00:59.750> this<00:01:00.190> adapter

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:01.190 
behind the camera I have this adapter

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:03.729 
behind the camera I have this adapter
now<00:01:02.000> this<00:01:02.239> is<00:01:02.360> a<00:01:02.390> pretty<00:01:02.690> cheap<00:01:03.470> little

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:03.739 
now this is a pretty cheap little

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:06.039 
now this is a pretty cheap little
adapter<00:01:03.950> I<00:01:04.489> don't<00:01:04.670> know<00:01:04.729> what<00:01:04.909> it<00:01:05.269> it's<00:01:05.449> an

00:01:06.039 --> 00:01:06.049 
adapter I don't know what it it's an

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:08.100 
adapter I don't know what it it's an
order<00:01:06.470> TV<00:01:06.890> or<00:01:07.159> something

what<00:01:13.640> $40.00<00:01:14.360> or<00:01:15.100> 2500<00:01:16.100> rupees<00:01:16.280> and<00:01:16.940> this<00:01:17.750> was

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:17.930 
what $40.00 or 2500 rupees and this was

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:20.320 
what $40.00 or 2500 rupees and this was
what<00:01:18.140> I<00:01:18.170> thought<00:01:18.530> I<00:01:18.770> really<00:01:19.760> made<00:01:20.030> a<00:01:20.240> huge

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:20.330 
what I thought I really made a huge

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.830 
what I thought I really made a huge
difference<00:01:20.630> so<00:01:21.320> it's<00:01:21.680> fairly<00:01:22.100> simple<00:01:22.630> all<00:01:23.630> you

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:23.840 
difference so it's fairly simple all you

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.670 
difference so it's fairly simple all you
got<00:01:24.049> to<00:01:24.229> do<00:01:24.440> is<00:01:25.270> you<00:01:26.270> know<00:01:26.390> take<00:01:26.600> out<00:01:26.750> the<00:01:27.049> Fuji

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:27.680 
got to do is you know take out the Fuji

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:39.109 
got to do is you know take out the Fuji
lens<00:01:27.890> and<00:01:28.220> fix<00:01:28.549> this<00:01:28.880> adapter

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.850 

Daigo<00:01:40.119> that<00:01:40.600> that's<00:01:40.960> pretty<00:01:41.200> much<00:01:41.320> it<00:01:41.680> and

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:41.860 
Daigo that that's pretty much it and

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:45.209 
Daigo that that's pretty much it and
then<00:01:42.219> now<00:01:42.460> you<00:01:43.210> can<00:01:43.390> fix<00:01:43.659> all<00:01:43.899> your<00:01:43.930> canon<00:01:44.920> eos

00:01:45.209 --> 00:01:45.219 
then now you can fix all your canon eos

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:47.550 
then now you can fix all your canon eos
lenses<00:01:45.729> on<00:01:45.880> this<00:01:46.180> now<00:01:46.899> there<00:01:47.110> are<00:01:47.229> a<00:01:47.259> couple<00:01:47.320> of

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:47.560 
lenses on this now there are a couple of

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:49.859 
lenses on this now there are a couple of
disadvantages<00:01:48.030> one<00:01:49.030> is<00:01:49.240> you<00:01:49.479> don't<00:01:49.689> get

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:49.869 
disadvantages one is you don't get

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:51.480 
disadvantages one is you don't get
aperture<00:01:50.259> control<00:01:50.649> because<00:01:50.979> as<00:01:51.100> you<00:01:51.220> know<00:01:51.340> the

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:51.490 
aperture control because as you know the

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:54.179 
aperture control because as you know the
u.s.<00:01:51.759> lenses<00:01:52.179> don't<00:01:52.360> come<00:01:52.659> with<00:01:52.869> a<00:01:53.189> manual

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:54.189 
u.s. lenses don't come with a manual

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:57.840 
u.s. lenses don't come with a manual
aperture<00:01:55.049> change<00:01:56.049> you<00:01:56.799> can't<00:01:57.220> do<00:01:57.399> this<00:01:57.579> on

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:57.850 
aperture change you can't do this on

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:59.639 
aperture change you can't do this on
those<00:01:58.210> lenses<00:01:58.479> it's<00:01:58.960> all<00:01:59.110> electronically

00:01:59.639 --> 00:01:59.649 
those lenses it's all electronically

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:02.760 
those lenses it's all electronically
controlled<00:02:00.130> and<00:02:00.310> this<00:02:01.299> here<00:02:02.200> does<00:02:02.530> not<00:02:02.560> have

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:02.770 
controlled and this here does not have

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:05.279 
controlled and this here does not have
any<00:02:03.069> electronic<00:02:03.490> contact<00:02:04.030> so<00:02:04.329> you<00:02:04.600> can't

00:02:05.279 --> 00:02:05.289 
any electronic contact so you can't

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:07.999 
any electronic contact so you can't
really<00:02:05.530> control<00:02:06.490> aperture<00:02:07.479> so<00:02:07.630> you<00:02:07.720> carded

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
really control aperture so you carded

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.070 
really control aperture so you carded
shoot<00:02:09.009> at<00:02:09.280> the<00:02:09.880> aperture<00:02:10.239> wide<00:02:10.390> open<00:02:10.720> which<00:02:10.869> I

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
shoot at the aperture wide open which I

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:15.229 
shoot at the aperture wide open which I
don't<00:02:11.140> care<00:02:11.500> I<00:02:12.060> do<00:02:13.060> it<00:02:13.180> anyway<00:02:13.590> that's<00:02:14.590> one

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:15.239 
don't care I do it anyway that's one

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:17.550 
don't care I do it anyway that's one
problem<00:02:16.239> and<00:02:16.599> the<00:02:16.660> other<00:02:16.810> problem<00:02:17.230> is<00:02:17.349> you

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
problem and the other problem is you

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.490 
problem and the other problem is you
cannot<00:02:17.890> use<00:02:18.099> autofocus<00:02:18.819> again<00:02:19.690> that's<00:02:19.989> that's

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
cannot use autofocus again that's that's

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.530 
cannot use autofocus again that's that's
not<00:02:20.709> a<00:02:20.769> problem<00:02:21.010> for<00:02:21.340> me<00:02:21.519> some<00:02:22.120> people<00:02:22.150> might

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
not a problem for me some people might

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.199 
not a problem for me some people might
find<00:02:22.750> it<00:02:22.930> challenging<00:02:23.140> because<00:02:24.000> you<00:02:25.000> know<00:02:25.090> the

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:25.209 
find it challenging because you know the

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:28.080 
find it challenging because you know the
used<00:02:25.390> auto<00:02:25.660> focus<00:02:26.140> but<00:02:26.349> I<00:02:26.470> kind<00:02:27.459> of<00:02:27.549> I<00:02:27.730> find<00:02:27.970> it

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
used auto focus but I kind of I find it

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:30.000 
used auto focus but I kind of I find it
very<00:02:28.150> convenient<00:02:28.660> because<00:02:28.989> you<00:02:29.650> don't<00:02:29.829> have

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
very convenient because you don't have

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.400 
very convenient because you don't have
to<00:02:30.160> focus<00:02:30.370> and<00:02:30.790> then<00:02:31.299> compose<00:02:31.959> you<00:02:32.230> can

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:32.410 
to focus and then compose you can

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:35.100 
to focus and then compose you can
compose<00:02:32.799> your<00:02:33.069> photo<00:02:33.310> and<00:02:33.640> then<00:02:34.360> focus<00:02:34.930> and

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
compose your photo and then focus and

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:37.680 
compose your photo and then focus and
that's<00:02:35.290> really<00:02:35.769> really<00:02:36.599> important<00:02:37.599> the

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
that's really really important the

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.530 
that's really really important the
composition<00:02:38.290> is<00:02:38.440> primary<00:02:39.040> so<00:02:39.760> so<00:02:40.209> I<00:02:40.269> really

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
composition is primary so so I really

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:43.590 
composition is primary so so I really
don't<00:02:40.720> care<00:02:40.780> and<00:02:41.430> so<00:02:42.430> that's<00:02:42.790> why<00:02:42.970> I<00:02:43.000> find<00:02:43.390> this

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:43.600 
don't care and so that's why I find this

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:45.690 
don't care and so that's why I find this
really<00:02:43.870> really<00:02:44.170> useful<00:02:44.380> and<00:02:45.160> let<00:02:45.280> me<00:02:45.400> connect

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
really really useful and let me connect

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.640 
really really useful and let me connect
a<00:02:45.819> Canon<00:02:46.150> lens<00:02:46.359> and<00:02:46.690> just<00:02:46.930> kind<00:02:47.319> of<00:02:47.380> show<00:02:47.590> you

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
a Canon lens and just kind of show you

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:55.890 
a Canon lens and just kind of show you
how<00:02:47.980> this<00:02:48.160> works<00:02:48.519> okay<00:02:53.790> um<00:02:54.790> so<00:02:55.389> technically<00:02:55.780> I

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
how this works okay um so technically I

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.080 
how this works okay um so technically I
don't<00:02:56.139> have<00:02:56.290> a<00:02:56.319> Canon<00:02:56.769> lens<00:02:56.980> this<00:02:57.370> is<00:02:57.430> a<00:02:57.579> sigma

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
don't have a Canon lens this is a sigma

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:01.680 
don't have a Canon lens this is a sigma
lens<00:02:58.480> but<00:02:59.410> it's<00:02:59.739> a<00:02:59.859> can<00:03:00.040> mount<00:03:00.370> and<00:03:00.730> this<00:03:01.540> is

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690 
lens but it's a can mount and this is

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:05.520 
lens but it's a can mount and this is
the<00:03:01.920> sigma<00:03:02.920> 85mm<00:03:03.700> 1.4<00:03:03.940> I<00:03:04.840> use<00:03:05.109> this<00:03:05.290> very

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
the sigma 85mm 1.4 I use this very

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:08.580 
the sigma 85mm 1.4 I use this very
frequently<00:03:06.150> this<00:03:07.150> is<00:03:07.329> my<00:03:07.510> portrait<00:03:08.290> go<00:03:08.530> to

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
frequently this is my portrait go to

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:11.430 
frequently this is my portrait go to
lengths<00:03:08.889> on<00:03:09.010> the<00:03:09.100> fighty<00:03:09.310> Mach<00:03:09.609> 3<00:03:09.880> and<00:03:10.440> it's

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:11.440 
lengths on the fighty Mach 3 and it's

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:14.309 
lengths on the fighty Mach 3 and it's
it's<00:03:11.709> much<00:03:12.220> much<00:03:12.579> cheaper<00:03:13.000> than<00:03:13.030> the<00:03:13.209> 85<00:03:13.630> 1.2

00:03:14.309 --> 00:03:14.319 
it's much much cheaper than the 85 1.2

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:17.120 
it's much much cheaper than the 85 1.2
and<00:03:14.500> and<00:03:14.859> really<00:03:15.100> the<00:03:15.400> quality<00:03:15.940> difference<00:03:16.420> is

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
and and really the quality difference is

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:20.250 
and and really the quality difference is
very<00:03:18.130> very<00:03:18.310> unnoticeable<00:03:19.269> so<00:03:19.510> you<00:03:19.959> know<00:03:20.079> this

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260 
very very unnoticeable so you know this

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:24.210 
very very unnoticeable so you know this
is<00:03:20.470> this<00:03:20.739> is<00:03:20.889> a<00:03:22.139> one<00:03:23.139> of<00:03:23.260> my<00:03:23.380> favorite<00:03:23.769> lenses

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:24.220 
is this is a one of my favorite lenses

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:27.569 
is this is a one of my favorite lenses
and<00:03:24.519> I<00:03:24.700> use<00:03:24.880> this<00:03:25.090> on<00:03:25.299> the<00:03:25.329> Fuji<00:03:25.720> x-pro<00:03:25.930> too<00:03:26.579> for

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:27.579 
and I use this on the Fuji x-pro too for

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:30.090 
and I use this on the Fuji x-pro too for
portraits<00:03:28.000> now<00:03:28.480> obviously<00:03:28.959> since<00:03:29.230> it's<00:03:29.470> a<00:03:29.530> 1.6

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:30.100 
portraits now obviously since it's a 1.6

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:33.839 
portraits now obviously since it's a 1.6
crop<00:03:30.489> 85<00:03:31.030> will<00:03:31.530> kind<00:03:32.530> of<00:03:32.709> become<00:03:33.549> a<00:03:33.579> little

00:03:33.839 --> 00:03:33.849 
crop 85 will kind of become a little

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:38.879 
crop 85 will kind of become a little
longer<00:03:34.150> more<00:03:34.540> than<00:03:34.720> 120<00:03:35.680> mm<00:03:35.980> but<00:03:36.780> again<00:03:37.780> if<00:03:38.530> you

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:38.889 
longer more than 120 mm but again if you

00:03:38.889 --> 00:03:40.379 
longer more than 120 mm but again if you
know<00:03:39.040> the<00:03:39.160> distances<00:03:39.670> you're<00:03:39.849> clicking<00:03:40.180> with

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:40.389 
know the distances you're clicking with
