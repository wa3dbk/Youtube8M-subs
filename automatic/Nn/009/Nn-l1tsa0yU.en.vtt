00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 serotonin- rich foods for 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.330

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.519
 the states of depression are 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.910
 correlate in such a way that although the 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:14.070
 diet does not solve the root problem 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:16.529
 it manages to at least mitigate what 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.330
 Foods rich in serotonin are a 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.820

 depression serotonin is a 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:26.460
 neurotransmitter that directly influences 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:29.130
 in depressive states if your rate in 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.590
 blood is elevated gives the feeling of 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:34.380
 pleasure and welfare decreasing the 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:37.200
 desire to eat flours and sugars at 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.930
 opposite if the serotonin rate is 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:43.110
 low you begin to feel the desire to 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:46.350
 consume sugary foods and that 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.510
 way it ends up getting fatter 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.850
 depressive states with diet 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.949
 these depressive states can be 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.379
 combated with food rich in 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.989
 serotonin since they act against 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:00.690
 depression the carbohydrates are the foods 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:04.159
 most influential since directly 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:06.750
 Serotonin rates increase as well 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:08.520
 there are other foods 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.550
 in the bosom of its proteins a 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.110
 amino acid called tryptophan this 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:15.090
 intervenes in the production of 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:18.479
 serotonin and that's why it's so important 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:20.460
 in food is very important 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.979
 to do this, make a good selection 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.450
 of foods that contain carbohydrates and 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.240
 proteins that help treat

 correctly depression without getting fat 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:33.090
 for that reason foods that we can consume 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.700

 foods are rich in tryptophan that 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:41.070
 directly intervenes in the synthesis 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:43.740
 of serotonin is equally convenient 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:46.500
 replace the white flours the 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.840
 pies pastry and sweets for 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:52.140
 vegetable foods fresh fruits 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:54.869

 is the fish and the chicken are rich in 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:19.110
 tryptophan and help to form serotonin

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:24.180
 alcohol since it affects the neurons 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:26.849
