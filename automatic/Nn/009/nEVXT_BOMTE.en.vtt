once it dries it looks very pretty
because<00:03:41.019> once<00:03:42.019> it<00:03:42.470> dries<00:03:42.919> the<00:03:43.790> glitter<00:03:44.090> paint

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:44.870 
because once it dries the glitter paint

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:48.849 
because once it dries the glitter paint
turns<00:03:45.530> gold<00:03:46.400> when<00:03:46.879> it's<00:03:47.120> wet<00:03:47.479> it<00:03:47.810> kind<00:03:48.650> of

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:48.859 
turns gold when it's wet it kind of

00:03:48.859 --> 00:03:52.030 
turns gold when it's wet it kind of
looks<00:03:49.220> like<00:03:49.340> wet<00:03:50.000> white<00:03:50.840> so<00:03:51.470> that's<00:03:51.680> why<00:03:51.979> it

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:52.040 
looks like wet white so that's why it

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:55.869 
looks like wet white so that's why it
doesn't<00:03:52.519> look<00:03:52.699> so<00:03:52.970> pretty<00:03:53.299> so<00:03:54.340> when<00:03:55.340> you<00:03:55.489> do

00:03:55.869 --> 00:03:55.879 
doesn't look so pretty so when you do

00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:57.879 
doesn't look so pretty so when you do
the<00:03:56.120> design<00:03:56.479> you<00:03:56.750> might<00:03:56.900> think<00:03:57.319> that<00:03:57.409> is<00:03:57.650> not

00:03:57.879 --> 00:03:57.889 
the design you might think that is not

00:03:57.889 --> 00:04:00.909 
the design you might think that is not
so<00:03:57.949> pretty<00:03:58.519> but<00:03:59.299> you<00:03:59.510> have<00:03:59.720> to<00:03:59.930> wait<00:04:00.169> for<00:04:00.620> two

00:04:00.909 --> 00:04:00.919 
so pretty but you have to wait for two

00:04:00.919 --> 00:04:05.170 
so pretty but you have to wait for two
hours<00:04:01.250> until<00:04:02.180> it<00:04:02.689> dries<00:04:03.019> completely<00:04:03.879> then<00:04:04.879> you

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:05.180 
hours until it dries completely then you

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:07.469 
hours until it dries completely then you
see<00:04:05.569> how<00:04:05.959> pretty<00:04:06.229> it<00:04:06.470> looks<00:04:06.769> like<00:04:07.069> because

00:04:07.469 --> 00:04:07.479 
see how pretty it looks like because

00:04:07.479 --> 00:04:11.020 
see how pretty it looks like because
once<00:04:08.479> it<00:04:08.720> completely<00:04:09.319> dries<00:04:09.680> then<00:04:10.609> you<00:04:10.790> can

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:11.030 
once it completely dries then you can

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:15.460 
once it completely dries then you can
see<00:04:11.359> your<00:04:12.199> blue<00:04:12.949> or<00:04:13.430> golden<00:04:14.030> sequins<00:04:14.659> in<00:04:14.989> gold

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:15.470 
see your blue or golden sequins in gold

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:19.080 
see your blue or golden sequins in gold
or<00:04:15.919> silver<00:04:15.949> whatever<00:04:16.849> color<00:04:17.440> glitter

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:19.090 
or silver whatever color glitter

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:22.409 
or silver whatever color glitter
dimensional<00:04:20.090> fabric<00:04:20.659> paint<00:04:20.959> you<00:04:21.199> have<00:04:21.229> used

00:04:22.409 --> 00:04:22.419 
dimensional fabric paint you have used

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:26.890 
dimensional fabric paint you have used
so<00:04:23.419> now<00:04:23.599> like<00:04:23.930> this<00:04:24.259> you<00:04:24.889> continue<00:04:25.580> and<00:04:25.900> the

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:26.900 
so now like this you continue and the
