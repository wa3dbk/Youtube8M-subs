00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.950
 chain turned on the television more 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:05.420
 environmental 

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:07.430
 biomagnetism is a therapy that 

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:09.350
 uses medium intensity magnets to 

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:11.300
 regulate body functions and today 

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:13.099
 our naturopathic family doctor 

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:14.960
 Jose Luis Manriquez is going to talk about 

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:17.920
 this way that is super interesting 

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:21.350
 to heal welcome how are you 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:23.540
 Luis, what happens is that it is not 

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:26.150
 no novelty of knowledge that apart from 

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:28.670
 this physical body that we have surrounds us 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:30.950
 an energetic body 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:33.620
 or electric if you want to call him so 

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:35.390
 activates the functions of the organs and 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:38.840
 that was studied very well by the 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:41.420
 Chinese people from India the Aztecs 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:43.910
 also the Mayans also knew about this 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:45.680
 situation and then that's why sometimes 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:48.850
 we take one thing and data that is 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:51.520
 doing true then is the body 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:53.630
 energy when you take a 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:55.880
 electrocardiogram what you measure too 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:58.910
 it is the electrical activity of the body 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:02.600
 when you take an encephalogram almost the 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:05.210
 electrical activity of the body then 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:08.360
 in this the magnets have a pole 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:10.850
 positive a negative pole attract the 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:13.490
 magnets when you put one of the by 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:17.090
 example in a magnetic strip that has 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:19.009
 this two already integrated magnets of 6 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.610
 centimeters that have 60 thousand degrees 

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:25.009
 this you put it on your spine 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:27.080
 this one you put in the navel and then 

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:29.869
 here the field that is in the middle is 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:32.570
 magnetic field flame goes through the 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:34.159
 clear organs or you're actually 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:35.960
 having an attraction from the front towards 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:39.710
 back and there even though it's from 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:41.810
 body in half pass is leveling that 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:44.810
 the atoms that we have in our 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:47.690
 organism and then if the atom is 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:50.119
 well leveled diseases is not 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:52.460
 easy to install now if you are already 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:54.979
 installed for what magnets are 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:57.409
 the magnets basically serve to 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:02:01.220
 remove the pain for example if this 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:03.850
 you put in the column you have a 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:05.810
 deflection of the column 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:09.350
 crushed a nerve called 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:12.920
 Asian you have this problems of a 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:15.470
 herniated disc is father help for 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.930
 soothe pain without needing to take 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:20.240
 many times medication which is the 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:22.370
 ideal moment of the day or position in 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:24.140
 which is worth using here what 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:26.720
 that is not recommended almost louis is 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:29.630
 when you are sleeping about using in 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:31.520
 activity because of the electrical issue and 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:33.740
 we recommend two hours in the morning 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:35.810
 and two hours in the afternoon that this is going to 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:38.750
 wear a belt and cited vÃ¡monos if 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:41.600
 we also have for example masks 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:43.970
 with magnets that you put them on and you 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:46.910
 improves the function of the eyes does not 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:48.470
 reach the eyes and here is a magnet 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:51.840
 in the middle 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:54.450
 it is in the third eye that was called 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.580
 or this communicates with the gland 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:03:02.400
 hypophysis and you remove the headache 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:06.269
 for using this the magnets and nothing 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:10.950
 more is a mask is actually a 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:13.769
 active and we also have templates and 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:16.019
 we have magnetic knee pads and a 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:18.810
 magnetic mat so that while 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:22.769
 are you sleeping are you getting 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:24.900
 the benefits of biomagnetism for the 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:27.180
 pain to rest to give him rest 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:29.970
 this for example we will have to get 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:33.750
 times and I recommend it all night 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:36.000
 well yes and then if you have pain of 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:38.280
 head in the night I give it to you and it lowers 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.349
 You have problems in view 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:42.299
 principle is going to get a lot of lagaÃ±a 

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:44.160
 he's going to get a lot of blood 

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:48.090
 mucus that is there but it is 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:50.670
 cleaning your eyes use it with all 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:52.290
 It's certainly not father because 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:54.269
 to see but for example doctor in 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:55.739
 silver we could talk about improving 

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:58.710
 some diseases that already 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:04:00.780
 they are chronic their could improve 

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:05.730
 what I do not want to talk about is that they are going to 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:08.400
 cure instead of dedicating ourselves to some 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:11.010
 thing done as more natural than it is 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:12.870
 yes yes of course more medicines 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:15.390
 for headache 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:17.340
 and you're take take and this probably 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:20.820
 can help to take away the pain of 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:23.520
 head that there is no medicine for the 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:25.980
 pain in the waist and this can help you 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:30.870
 to take away the pain what good of 

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:32.820
 diameter if you put it here that helps you 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:34.760
 for gastritis help for the 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:38.130
 colitis but scientifically proven 

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:39.960
 in fact we give therapies there in 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:43.230
 the clinic where I work 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:46.710
 biomagnetism that is given there more complete 

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:48.140
 this is like therapy at home ok but what 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:50.820
 take you home 

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:52.800
 to complement and the joke like 

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:55.470
 we have always talked martita that no 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:58.140
 you are taking and taking medicines and 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:59.820
 exams lab tests when 

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:02.130
 must know the audience there 

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:04.139
 many things that can help you 

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:05.909
 conserve health 

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:08.490
 improve your health so rather 

00:05:05.909 --> 00:05:11.189
 when directed by a doctor and in 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:13.860
 reality is simple grace will be placed 

00:05:11.189 --> 00:05:16.139
 in different specific media very well 

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:17.789
 it ends up being very useful there 

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:19.499
 there are doctor manrique's networks for 

00:05:17.789 --> 00:05:21.960
 that they can get in touch with him or 

00:05:19.499 --> 00:05:24.210
 can read more about this topic 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:26.030
 thanks doctor a taste beyond luis 

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:28.040
 pleasure 

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:30.080
