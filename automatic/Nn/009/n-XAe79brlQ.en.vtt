I<00:02:08.539> just<00:02:09.539> a<00:02:09.750> wash<00:02:09.989> two<00:02:10.140> on<00:02:10.319> with<00:02:10.679> one<00:02:10.739> of

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
I just a wash two on with one of

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.820 
I just a wash two on with one of
evolutions<00:02:11.550> I<00:02:11.700> do<00:02:11.760> have<00:02:12.060> which<00:02:13.050> is<00:02:13.080> a<00:02:13.260> double

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
evolutions I do have which is a double

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.960 
evolutions I do have which is a double
action<00:02:14.480> it<00:02:15.480> seems<00:02:15.810> to<00:02:15.989> what<00:02:16.140> fine<00:02:16.489> it's<00:02:17.489> think

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
action it seems to what fine it's think

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.350 
action it seems to what fine it's think
it's<00:02:18.120> like<00:02:18.269> a<00:02:18.300> masterless<00:02:19.940> g23<00:02:20.940> or<00:02:21.120> something

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
it's like a masterless g23 or something

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.380 
it's like a masterless g23 or something
like<00:02:21.450> that<00:02:21.980> not<00:02:22.980> high-end<00:02:23.250> one<00:02:23.730> but<00:02:24.030> it<00:02:24.150> does

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
like that not high-end one but it does

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.100 
like that not high-end one but it does
work<00:02:24.420> fine<00:02:25.760> until<00:02:26.760> I<00:02:27.239> don't<00:02:27.630> know<00:02:27.720> the<00:02:27.870> black

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
work fine until I don't know the black

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:33.949 
work fine until I don't know the black
and<00:02:28.349> so<00:02:28.560> cool<00:02:32.000> this<00:02:33.000> assume<00:02:33.330> is<00:02:33.510> really<00:02:33.780> kind

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 
and so cool this assume is really kind

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:36.110 
and so cool this assume is really kind
of<00:02:34.110> crap<00:02:34.380> on<00:02:34.650> it<00:02:34.680> though<00:02:35.010> because<00:02:35.519> I<00:02:35.730> as<00:02:35.910> you

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
of crap on it though because I as you

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:41.660 
of crap on it though because I as you
zoom<00:02:36.269> in<00:02:36.510> it<00:02:36.690> just<00:02:36.870> kind<00:02:37.080> of<00:02:37.140> blows<00:02:40.489> so<00:02:41.489> that's

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
zoom in it just kind of blows so that's

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:46.339 
zoom in it just kind of blows so that's
that<00:02:41.849> Kali<00:02:42.170> and<00:02:43.940> the<00:02:44.940> interior<00:02:45.390> on<00:02:46.230> the

00:02:46.339 --> 00:02:46.349

00:04:52.969 --> 00:04:52.979 
underneath the hood that I think it's a

underneath the hood that I think it's a
five<00:04:53.310> little<00:04:54.050> thinking<00:04:55.050> I<00:04:56.060> remember

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:57.060 
five little thinking I remember

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:00.550 
five little thinking I remember
correctly<00:04:57.210> maybe<00:04:57.840> it's<00:04:58.020> a<00:04:58.050> 4.7<00:04:58.770> ladle<00:04:59.150> but

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:00.560 
correctly maybe it's a 4.7 ladle but

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:04.420 
correctly maybe it's a 4.7 ladle but
either<00:05:01.560> way<00:05:01.860> it's<00:05:02.070> pretty<00:05:02.430> nice<00:05:02.699> engine<00:05:03.000> I

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:04.430 
either way it's pretty nice engine I

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:06.980 
either way it's pretty nice engine I
don't<00:05:05.430> think<00:05:05.520> that<00:05:05.820> really<00:05:05.970> produces<00:05:06.479> 500

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:06.990 
don't think that really produces 500

don't think that really produces 500
