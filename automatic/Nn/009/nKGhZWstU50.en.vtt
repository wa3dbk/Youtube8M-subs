00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
time I find that when I cook it a long

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.460 
time I find that when I cook it a long
time<00:02:56.430> the<00:02:57.430> sausage<00:02:57.940> gets<00:02:58.180> super<00:02:58.720> tender

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
time the sausage gets super tender

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:02.009 
time the sausage gets super tender
it<00:03:00.250> becomes<00:03:00.610> you<00:03:01.000> know<00:03:01.090> soft<00:03:01.480> like<00:03:01.720> a<00:03:01.810> meatball

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:02.019 
it becomes you know soft like a meatball

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:03.170 
it becomes you know soft like a meatball
and<00:03:02.230> that's<00:03:02.500> how<00:03:02.650> I<00:03:02.709> like<00:03:02.920> it

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
and that's how I like it

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.060 
and that's how I like it
so<00:03:04.180> I<00:03:04.209> will<00:03:04.600> be<00:03:04.720> adjusting<00:03:04.840> the<00:03:05.440> seasonings

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510 
throughout the afternoon this will

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:09.330 
throughout the afternoon this will
definitely<00:03:07.989> reduce<00:03:08.320> a<00:03:08.560> little<00:03:08.709> bit<00:03:08.950> if<00:03:09.160> it

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
definitely reduce a little bit if it

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.520 
definitely reduce a little bit if it
gets<00:03:09.519> too<00:03:09.760> thick<00:03:10.030> I<00:03:10.239> can<00:03:10.390> add<00:03:10.570> some<00:03:10.870> more<00:03:10.900> water

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530 
gets too thick I can add some more water

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:14.280 
gets too thick I can add some more water
