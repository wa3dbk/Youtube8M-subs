00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
which I have not seen a video on on

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.330 
which I have not seen a video on on
YouTube<00:00:33.719> I<00:00:33.840> may<00:00:33.989> be<00:00:34.050> wrong<00:00:34.320> let<00:00:34.950> me<00:00:34.980> show<00:00:35.280> you

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.760 
YouTube I may be wrong let me show you
what<00:00:35.489> this<00:00:35.579> is<00:00:35.850> these<00:00:36.780> are<00:00:36.840> fake<00:00:37.170> chunks<00:00:37.620> in

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
what this is these are fake chunks in

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.670 
what this is these are fake chunks in
Minecraft<00:00:38.520> you<00:00:39.329> could<00:00:39.809> probably<00:00:40.170> relate<00:00:40.500> them

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
Minecraft you could probably relate them

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.340 
Minecraft you could probably relate them
to<00:00:40.860> like<00:00:40.980> far<00:00:41.309> lands<00:00:41.550> back<00:00:41.850> in<00:00:42.030> beta<00:00:42.270> but<00:00:43.260> you

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
to like far lands back in beta but you

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.250 
to like far lands back in beta but you
can<00:00:43.440> really<00:00:43.649> tell<00:00:43.890> something's<00:00:44.280> going<00:00:44.550> wrong

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:45.260 
can really tell something's going wrong

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.290 
can really tell something's going wrong
this<00:00:46.260> the<00:00:46.800> torches<00:00:47.190> are<00:00:47.370> not<00:00:47.550> really<00:00:47.910> aligned

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
this the torches are not really aligned

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.940 
this the torches are not really aligned
to<00:00:48.480> the<00:00:48.570> particles<00:00:49.079> which<00:00:49.260> they<00:00:49.530> are<00:00:49.649> emitting

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
to the particles which they are emitting

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.299 
to the particles which they are emitting
and<00:00:50.280> that's<00:00:51.120> because<00:00:51.449> look<00:00:52.199> at<00:00:52.260> f3<00:00:52.410> I<00:00:52.829> am

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
and that's because look at f3 I am

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.389 
and that's because look at f3 I am
behind<00:00:53.809> 13<00:00:54.809> million<00:00:55.170> blocks<00:00:55.379> away<00:00:55.710> from<00:00:55.920> spawn

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
behind 13 million blocks away from spawn

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.189 
behind 13 million blocks away from spawn
yeah<00:00:57.180> so<00:00:57.480> that's<00:00:57.660> why<00:00:57.809> this<00:00:57.870> is<00:00:58.109> happening

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
yeah so that's why this is happening

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.170 
yeah so that's why this is happening
without<00:00:58.649> further<00:00:59.010> ado<00:00:59.370> let's<00:00:59.730> get<00:00:59.850> into<00:00:59.910> this

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
without further ado let's get into this

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:01.760 
without further ado let's get into this
so<00:01:00.480> first<00:01:01.079> of<00:01:01.230> all<00:01:01.289> you<00:01:01.410> can<00:01:01.530> see<00:01:01.649> these

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
so first of all you can see these

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.470 
so first of all you can see these
torches<00:01:02.160> second<00:01:02.879> one<00:01:03.000> I'd<00:01:03.120> like<00:01:03.149> to<00:01:03.270> show<00:01:03.449> you

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
torches second one I'd like to show you

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.370 
torches second one I'd like to show you
is<00:01:04.129> these<00:01:05.129> pistons<00:01:05.909> they<00:01:06.780> do<00:01:06.840> not<00:01:07.170> look<00:01:07.350> very

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
is these pistons they do not look very

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:08.780 
is these pistons they do not look very
well<00:01:07.770> yeah

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
well yeah

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.149 
well yeah
so<00:01:08.970> these<00:01:09.450> piston<00:01:09.810> extensions<00:01:10.260> are<00:01:10.470> very<00:01:10.950> much

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
so these piston extensions are very much

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:12.980 
so these piston extensions are very much
glitched<00:01:11.400> out<00:01:11.549> they<00:01:12.030> still<00:01:12.270> work<00:01:12.479> so<00:01:12.780> I<00:01:12.840> can

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
glitched out they still work so I can

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.620 
glitched out they still work so I can
still<00:01:13.200> put<00:01:13.380> a<00:01:13.409> block<00:01:13.680> on<00:01:13.710> top<00:01:14.010> of<00:01:14.130> them<00:01:14.250> and

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:14.630 
still put a block on top of them and

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:16.399 
still put a block on top of them and
they're<00:01:15.630> still<00:01:15.810> function<00:01:16.140> properly

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
they're still function properly

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.249 
they're still function properly
definitely<00:01:17.340> something<00:01:17.700> which<00:01:17.880> I<00:01:18.210> would<00:01:18.780> when

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
definitely something which I would when

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.140 
definitely something which I would when
I<00:01:19.290> first<00:01:19.590> saw<00:01:19.740> this<00:01:19.890> also<00:01:20.130> shot<00:01:20.549> one<00:01:21.000> of<00:01:21.090> the

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
I first saw this also shot one of the

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.520 
I first saw this also shot one of the
weirdest<00:01:21.450> things<00:01:21.630> that<00:01:21.869> actually<00:01:22.140> happens

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
weirdest things that actually happens

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.200 
weirdest things that actually happens
when<00:01:22.860> you're<00:01:22.979> are<00:01:23.100> 13<00:01:23.430> million<00:01:23.640> blocks<00:01:23.939> away

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
when you're are 13 million blocks away

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.480 
when you're are 13 million blocks away
from<00:01:24.360> spine<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:25.650> second<00:01:25.979> thing<00:01:26.130> which<00:01:26.310> I

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
from spine the second thing which I

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.300 
from spine the second thing which I
think<00:01:26.520> is<00:01:26.820> probably<00:01:27.090> one<00:01:27.240> even<00:01:27.659> weirder<00:01:28.110> is

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:28.310 
think is probably one even weirder is

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:31.399 
think is probably one even weirder is
redstone<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:29.700> way<00:01:29.790> it<00:01:29.880> looks<00:01:30.090> it<00:01:30.990> takes<00:01:31.259> up

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
redstone the way it looks it takes up

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.950 
redstone the way it looks it takes up
the<00:01:31.530> full<00:01:31.560> block<00:01:31.979> but<00:01:32.790> when<00:01:33.090> you<00:01:33.210> extend<00:01:33.630> it<00:01:33.750> it

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
the full block but when you extend it it

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.770 
the full block but when you extend it it
looks<00:01:34.140> fine<00:01:34.409> but<00:01:35.159> when<00:01:35.310> you<00:01:35.430> turn<00:01:35.790> the<00:01:36.570> large

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
looks fine but when you turn the large

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.069 
looks fine but when you turn the large
redstone<00:01:37.320> diet<00:01:37.650> does<00:01:37.950> not<00:01:38.189> align<00:01:38.520> with<00:01:38.579> the

00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:39.079 
redstone diet does not align with the

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:42.800 
redstone diet does not align with the
the<00:01:40.079> two<00:01:40.290> adjacent<00:01:40.439> blocks<00:01:41.130> here<00:01:41.430> so<00:01:41.810> again

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
the two adjacent blocks here so again

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.899 
the two adjacent blocks here so again
something<00:01:43.170> which<00:01:43.409> is<00:01:43.560> really<00:01:43.860> strange<00:01:44.130> if<00:01:44.700> you

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
something which is really strange if you

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.609 
something which is really strange if you
guys<00:01:45.030> have<00:01:45.270> any<00:01:45.479> ideas<00:01:45.869> why<00:01:46.079> this<00:01:46.140> happens

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
guys have any ideas why this happens

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.800 
guys have any ideas why this happens
please<00:01:46.950> leave<00:01:47.189> a<00:01:47.369> comment<00:01:47.700> I'm<00:01:48.090> pretty<00:01:48.600> sure

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
please leave a comment I'm pretty sure

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.840 
please leave a comment I'm pretty sure
lis<00:01:48.899> files<00:01:49.170> like<00:01:49.470> maybe<00:01:49.920> 7<00:01:50.369> or<00:01:50.460> 8<00:01:50.640> million

something<00:01:52.920> these<00:01:53.369> visual<00:01:53.700> imperfections

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
something these visual imperfections

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.389 
something these visual imperfections
might<00:01:54.360> be<00:01:54.509> like<00:01:54.720> slightly<00:01:55.680> off<00:01:55.829> point<00:01:56.159> and

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
might be like slightly off point and

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.130 
might be like slightly off point and
then<00:01:56.549> when<00:01:56.729> I<00:01:56.759> actually<00:01:56.939> go<00:01:57.270> all<00:01:57.719> the<00:01:57.990> way<00:01:58.020> to

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
then when I actually go all the way to

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.139 
then when I actually go all the way to
like<00:01:58.350> 26<00:01:58.829> million<00:01:59.040> they<00:01:59.520> might<00:01:59.700> look<00:01:59.850> even

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
like 26 million they might look even

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:01.880 
like 26 million they might look even
weirder<00:02:00.509> than<00:02:00.540> they<00:02:00.750> do<00:02:00.930> right<00:02:00.960> now<00:02:01.170> but<00:02:01.829> I

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
weirder than they do right now but I

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.620 
weirder than they do right now but I
think<00:02:02.430> this<00:02:02.729> is<00:02:02.850> probably<00:02:02.969> sufficient<00:02:03.299> for

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
think this is probably sufficient for

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.319 
think this is probably sufficient for
you<00:02:03.719> guys<00:02:03.840> to<00:02:04.110> to<00:02:04.770> look<00:02:04.920> at<00:02:05.159> let's<00:02:06.090> see<00:02:06.210> if<00:02:06.270> I

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
you guys to to look at let's see if I

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.900 
you guys to to look at let's see if I
put<00:02:06.479> a<00:02:06.540> redstone<00:02:06.750> torch<00:02:06.899> and<00:02:07.439> turn<00:02:07.860> it<00:02:08.039> yeah<00:02:08.489> it

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
put a redstone torch and turn it yeah it

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.089 
put a redstone torch and turn it yeah it
still<00:02:09.149> works<00:02:09.360> but<00:02:09.780> definitely<00:02:10.440> not<00:02:10.619> the<00:02:10.979> way

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
still works but definitely not the way

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:12.740 
still works but definitely not the way
it<00:02:11.160> should<00:02:11.250> really<00:02:11.610> look<00:02:11.790> if<00:02:12.060> I<00:02:12.239> place<00:02:12.540> a

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
it should really look if I place a

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:13.850 
it should really look if I place a

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
with the entity again very strange they

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.590 
with the entity again very strange they
still<00:02:19.410> work<00:02:19.530> probably<00:02:19.770> I<00:02:20.160> don't<00:02:20.790> I<00:02:20.910> did<00:02:21.180> not<00:02:21.360> go

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 
still work probably I don't I did not go

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:22.790 
still work probably I don't I did not go
into<00:02:21.750> the<00:02:21.840> minecart<00:02:22.200> let's<00:02:22.380> see<00:02:22.530> if<00:02:22.650> that

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
into the minecart let's see if that

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.410 
into the minecart let's see if that
actually<00:02:22.950> does<00:02:23.430> work<00:02:23.460> as<00:02:23.820> well<00:02:23.970> I'm<00:02:24.210> pretty

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
actually does work as well I'm pretty

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.490 
actually does work as well I'm pretty
sure<00:02:24.540> will<00:02:24.750> oh<00:02:24.960> wow<00:02:26.420> yeah<00:02:27.420> okay<00:02:27.900> see<00:02:27.960> it's<00:02:28.350> not

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
sure will oh wow yeah okay see it's not

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.230 
sure will oh wow yeah okay see it's not
really<00:02:28.740> that<00:02:28.770> great<00:02:29.040> either<00:02:29.190> but<00:02:29.760> they<00:02:30.090> go

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:30.240 
really that great either but they go

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.900 
really that great either but they go

a place it here the it actually breaks

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.930 
a place it here the it actually breaks

suffocated and over here also stays but

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:49.640 
suffocated and over here also stays but
you<00:02:48.480> can<00:02:48.570> see<00:02:48.720> it<00:02:48.810> kind<00:02:48.990> of<00:02:49.080> flashing<00:02:49.350> it's

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
you can see it kind of flashing it's

of course it doesn't really doesn't
really<00:02:59.730> fall<00:02:59.970> when<00:03:00.239> you<00:03:00.330> place<00:03:00.540> it<00:03:00.660> on<00:03:00.720> the

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
really fall when you place it on the

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.050 
and lastly item frames do not behave as

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:09.680 
and lastly item frames do not behave as
well<00:03:07.230> in<00:03:07.500> fact<00:03:08.190> if<00:03:08.400> you<00:03:08.489> place<00:03:08.730> an<00:03:09.000> item<00:03:09.420> in<00:03:09.600> the

well in fact if you place an item in the

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459 
Wikipedia page it doesn't okay it's not

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:16.850 
Wikipedia page it doesn't okay it's not
even<00:03:14.640> letting<00:03:14.820> me<00:03:15.000> place<00:03:15.239> it<00:03:15.510> but<00:03:16.170> I<00:03:16.200> think<00:03:16.680> it

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860 
even letting me place it but I think it

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:18.979 
even letting me place it but I think it
I<00:03:17.070> think<00:03:17.850> it<00:03:18.090> actually<00:03:18.150> does<00:03:18.360> maybe<00:03:18.750> if<00:03:18.900> I

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
I think it actually does maybe if I

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:22.400 
I think it actually does maybe if I
place<00:03:19.290> it<00:03:19.530> over<00:03:19.650> here<00:03:20.450> well<00:03:21.450> it's<00:03:22.140> not<00:03:22.230> really

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
place it over here well it's not really

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:24.680 
place it over here well it's not really
letting<00:03:22.650> me<00:03:22.769> place<00:03:22.980> it<00:03:23.010> an<00:03:23.430> item<00:03:23.700> here<00:03:23.910> let's

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
letting me place it an item here let's
