00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.400
 love me milan call me don't love me love me 

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:16.320
 hi girls finally got the 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:18.600
 spring and I'm super happy because I'm 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.810
 best winter fall not winter 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.880
 I tolerate them a lot because they are chilly 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:27.470
 this name the rope atika if there is no 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.470
 alone I'm not in a good mood 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.500
 so for this reason makeup 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.270
 spring for the lips I thought a 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.090
 hombre with two colors that I like 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.219
 very much that i am fuchsia e 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.780
 the orange however once that 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.850
 learned to make temple eyeshadow 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.710
 to abuse with other combinations in short 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.559
 those that you like the most though 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.210
 most importantly, first of all is that 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.070
 breast lips hydrated with the usual 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.560
 of its neighbors allows a toothbrush 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.740
 from teeth 

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:02.560
 after he went to take them off then we go to 

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:05.720
 pass the cocoa butter 

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:07.370
 I use this blitz produced in the pharmacy 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.410
 I had taken it again this winter 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:12.870
 because I think they work a lot 

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:16.050
 better than the labellum yes more 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:17.160
 let's say professionals then don't have to 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:20.210
 be the light of the lips 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:24.650
 let's dry them 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:26.750
 ok ok then we just take a 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:29.119
 pencils you can also use a lipstick 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:31.490
 but I am better with the pencil 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:33.619
 because to make the contour of course it is 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:36.350
 more comfortable 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:40.900
 ok then i will make the orange outline 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:40.900
 so it is clearer and the fritz deception 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.700
 no 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.940
 ok once the outline is done will be the 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:10.630
 Sun 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:13.120
 I made a scalding pencil that was 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:17.350
 duel on offer with two euros in pencil 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:18.880
 glossy lips inside I'm going to do 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:21.480
 the interior with fuchsia with pencil 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:24.030
 of the new kids collection coro cai dal 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.560
 number 6 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:29.220
 so let's just connect 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.220
 the interior 

00:02:47.909 --> 00:02:55.769
 the corners don't go back to 

00:02:52.719 --> 00:02:55.769
 resume orange 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:03.710
 you know 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.959
 you know 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:25.000
 today we need a lip brush 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:33.220
 and let's try to fade but not too not 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:35.950
 we have to mix if not even lose 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:40.810
 the sense of the shadows we go only where 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:43.180
 There are joints resulting in a bit 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:45.629
 vanish 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:45.629
 Yup 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:55.940
 then if you want to create an effect a little 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:55.940
 more opaque we take an eye shadow 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:03.500
 orange built and we beat it on 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:03.500
 side dish 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:15.819
 on the sides we say 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:32.490
 for with important it remains the 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:36.530
 difference in short that the outline is 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:40.689
 sees that in the end the worms assist 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:45.869
 I believe 

00:04:40.689 --> 00:04:45.869
 and this is a possibility
