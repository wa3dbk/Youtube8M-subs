actually<00:01:57.329> let's<00:01:57.659> take<00:01:57.810> a<00:01:57.869> look<00:01:58.079> at<00:01:58.200> how<00:01:58.290> big<00:01:58.500> it

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
actually let's take a look at how big it

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.319 
actually let's take a look at how big it
is<00:01:58.710> compared<00:01:59.579> to<00:01:59.640> the<00:01:59.729> other<00:01:59.820> dragons<00:02:02.329> all

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
is compared to the other dragons all

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:06.709 
is compared to the other dragons all
right<00:02:03.479> so<00:02:03.630> it's<00:02:03.810> bigger<00:02:04.049> than<00:02:04.320> the<00:02:04.560> the<00:02:05.719> the

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
right so it's bigger than the the the

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:12.680 
right so it's bigger than the the the
gummi<00:02:07.320> dragon<00:02:07.890> the<00:02:08.069> music<00:02:08.459> dragon<00:02:11.090> level<00:02:12.090> 4<00:02:12.450> is

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
gummi dragon the music dragon level 4 is
