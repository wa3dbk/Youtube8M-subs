00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:06.299
 Welcome people to a new one 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.770
 Today, I already do it today 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:09.059
 think now should the twentieth 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.860
 already be edition 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:14.250
 that would be great in any case 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:17.310
 here just after 20 already 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.990
 editions of reddoxx unbelievable her 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.060
 You can write in, I know 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.050
 This format is very well received by you 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.910
 So you have already written 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.350
 richards and so on but you 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.730
 can still write purely because di 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.519
 resta tour's also there because I see 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:32.189
 I've already set myself in 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:34.050
 my plan when I will upload something 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.079
 So I have all the resta 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.110
 do you think through when I'm going to 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.760
 I for example can already say that 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:43.829
 the crossbow number 46 I think 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.870
 I am sure but so in 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.090
 he comes the way so I can you 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.980
 In any case say that that will come 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:53.480
 and I have that right up to now 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:56.160
 follow 50 pre-planned that is if you 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.840
 want to see the follow up 50 then 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.050
 Write in if I can, too 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:03.870
 cut short if you really wanted to but 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.720
 I guess when the format building 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.040
 arrives this should also stop what 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.869
 very very well arrived at your place 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.880
 I've heard this rating 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:14.210
 down here so where i just stop 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.860
 again a blind so a conclusion 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:18.119
 and yes you can too 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.390
 write down suggestions for improvement 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:23.070
 for example that and that you should 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.830
 maybe add more talk 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:28.409
 about his song quite banal for example 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:32.030
 or so today it should be about the us 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:35.130
 go out some time ago i believe 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:38.880
 months there was a documentary on the wwe 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:41.280
 network through the museums like 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.930
 that has developed like her 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.460
 come to the wm and so on 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.860
 was very interesting in my opinion 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.439
 jimmy and jay dee soost 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.759
 So that's twins in one day 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:54.979
 Team I personally think so 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:58.320
 apart that jay just be right 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:02:01.950
 his facebook has and jimmy has it left 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.890
 on the left and so can 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.100
 you distinguish them pretty well 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.930
 or 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.780
 that is of course meant when 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:12.900
 you look run head-on so nico 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:16.770
 if you stay in the valley if you like the 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:21.239
 course, of course, exactly when 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:23.450
 one takes it now she has then the 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:25.920
 painting 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:28.560
 so if you had told that 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:31.140
 painting here and jimmy the painting 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:35.940
 so here if you are on it frontal 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:38.550
 jay looks right with www and jimmy on the left 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.860
 because of the left so I notice that 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:42.510
 but of course others also say 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.819
 I am weak as I am 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:47.150
 but have noticed no matter the main thing you 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:49.739
 can remember the two are yes 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:51.450
 sons i believe in ricky when i am 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:55.140
 now if not me now 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.830
 Quite that would be really embarrassing me 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:58.400
 think so 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:02.550
 In any case her uncle is skinny 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:04.650
 Richie is her father and the two are 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:08.670
 first been a football player 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:10.920
 even successful and were 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:13.790
 always very very unused he has 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:16.110
 her mother said in the doku and 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:19.500
 By the way, one is like me because of him 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:22.920
 is called jonas I think so one of 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:25.640
 I'm just as hot as they are 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:28.860
 pronounced in German 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:31.440
 and i think the team is in total 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:33.540
 very complete because you have it in the beginning 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:35.250
 as the name was brought as the Samoan 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:37.280
 destroying did not quite work 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:39.090
 Now you have very spaces and as 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:40.709
 audience favorites with their initials 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:42.520
 danztage brought that to work 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:44.530
 actually great with the crowd 

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:46.210
 that's really good and I think 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:48.790
 Also, they bring solid is solid 

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:51.220
 achievements are just the champions and 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:54.550
 I hope they will come soon as it is 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:57.040
 people in the direction of wrestlemania because 

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:58.810
 I personally wish that now 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:02.580
 first at almost lane is one 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:02.580
 title defense resp 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:10.500
 moment small moment 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:17.269
 so sorry that at almost lane 

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:19.790
 title defense there and then 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:22.100
 then as humans against the 

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:24.400
 usa from rhede to wrestlemania that would be 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:28.520
 great and then how it people the title 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:30.800
 get at wrestlemania and i believe 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:31.720
 then the session but if you 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:33.889
 that would do 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:35.270
 I will definitely like it 

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:36.669
 So you can definitely times 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:38.660
 like to do it for me 

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:41.270
 otherwise I do not know what you big 

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:43.820
 want to do because you are asking now 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:46.850
 that and gold dust and the minister and 

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:49.520
 that one is now together and too 

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:51.080
 Hot kids as a tag team and so on 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:54.080
 of course, as already at 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:56.449
 the latter ad hoc mentions new teams 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:58.520
 come for example just now the 

00:04:56.449 --> 00:05:00.889
 station have just come or the 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:02.600
 lucia breakers and that was actually 

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:03.919
 That's the perfect way to do that 

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:06.380
 opinion and then you would have again 

00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:10.160
 a horny techteam scene with the usa 

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:12.110
 along with hot cherries and the 

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:14.000
 user dragons So those are super 

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:17.210
 day teams actually that's a good one 

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:20.180
 Of course, new day is required 

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:22.130
 but still good for the rather 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:25.130
 jogger area responsible monument unfortunately 

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:26.780
 in which there is more in it but in addition 

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:28.789
 I will certainly be in the 

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:33.860
 what to mention coming videos 

00:05:28.789 --> 00:05:35.120
 exactly the jusos in total are not 

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:38.210
 bad at the microphone I noticed 

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:39.979
 so if you have to keep pro you are 

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:43.400
 I do not say okay 

00:05:39.979 --> 00:05:44.599
 necessarily bad or something but are 

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:46.520
 Of course now not the die 

00:05:44.599 --> 00:05:48.650
 must keep promos are therefore 

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:50.660
 actually my stories where you as a day 

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:52.729
 teams fight against tec teams 

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:56.840
 for example, now also miss and mister 

00:05:52.729 --> 00:05:58.460
 and so on so yes the 

00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:00.100
 is understandable that they are there 

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:03.169
 not necessarily need the promo skins 

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:04.400
 but hopefully they will come against them 

00:06:03.169 --> 00:06:07.760
 extension and then lose there the 

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:11.870
 Title that would be the perfect as 

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:14.900
 you could plan that, after all 

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:16.070
 So the tag team is the jusos 

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:19.940
 generally pretty much 

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:22.400
 convincing the problem that this one 

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:25.699
 little colorless or boring in 

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:29.150
 Lately they have been there always 

00:06:25.699 --> 00:06:32.690
 These faces are in good mood throughout 

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:35.330
 and yes that is considered by many 

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:39.560
 colorless and boring beware 

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:40.700
 with me a bit but there 

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:42.410
 is it I guess with even what 

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:42.680
 make them and you have something with them 

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:46.150
 in front 

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:49.210
 I think so and yes I would say 

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:52.280
 the jusos a cool team 

00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:55.010
 write your opinion to the foot in 

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:57.020
 and gives something to say 

00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:59.530
 I do not think you until next time 

00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:59.530
 and ciao
