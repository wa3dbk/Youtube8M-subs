this is from their nude collection on

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.950 
this is from their nude collection on
that<00:00:56.699> I<00:00:56.789> have<00:00:57.000> is<00:00:57.180> in<00:00:57.360> 7<00:00:57.780> 1<00:00:57.960> 0<00:00:57.989> so<00:00:58.500> 3<00:00:58.710> send<00:00:59.129> and

00:00:59.950 --> 00:00:59.960 
that I have is in 7 1 0 so 3 send and

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.840 
that I have is in 7 1 0 so 3 send and
this<00:01:00.960> is<00:01:01.109> also<00:01:01.440> I<00:01:02.100> think<00:01:02.340> this<00:01:02.609> is<00:01:02.730> actually

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
this is also I think this is actually

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.850 
this is also I think this is actually
lighter<00:01:03.359> than<00:01:03.510> the<00:01:03.809> one<00:01:03.899> I<00:01:04.170> showed<00:01:04.409> you<00:01:04.470> before

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
lighter than the one I showed you before

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.330 
lighter than the one I showed you before
and<00:01:05.400> this<00:01:06.299> looks<00:01:06.570> very<00:01:06.659> nice<00:01:07.049> but<00:01:07.350> it<00:01:07.860> can<00:01:08.100> can

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
and this looks very nice but it can can

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.490 
and this looks very nice but it can can
wash<00:01:08.610> you<00:01:08.820> out<00:01:09.030> so<00:01:09.479> it<00:01:09.720> does<00:01:09.960> depend<00:01:09.990> on<00:01:10.350> your

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
wash you out so it does depend on your

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.100 
wash you out so it does depend on your
skin<00:01:10.770> tone<00:01:10.950> if<00:01:11.130> you<00:01:11.280> are<00:01:11.430> darker<00:01:11.909> than<00:01:12.119> me<00:01:12.299> then

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
skin tone if you are darker than me then

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.810 
skin tone if you are darker than me then
I'm<00:01:13.290> not<00:01:13.439> sure<00:01:13.650> how<00:01:13.830> it's<00:01:14.040> gonna<00:01:14.220> work<00:01:14.340> on<00:01:14.670> you

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
I'm not sure how it's gonna work on you

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.780 
I'm not sure how it's gonna work on you
but<00:01:15.119> for<00:01:15.869> me<00:01:15.990> I<00:01:16.020> really<00:01:16.470> like<00:01:16.650> this<00:01:16.860> but<00:01:17.369> it<00:01:17.610> is

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
but for me I really like this but it is

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.050 
but for me I really like this but it is
kind<00:01:18.210> of<00:01:18.330> melt<00:01:18.600> on<00:01:18.930> my<00:01:19.110> lips<00:01:19.350> so<00:01:19.530> I<00:01:19.920> do<00:01:20.220> apply<00:01:20.790> a

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
kind of melt on my lips so I do apply a

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.600 
kind of melt on my lips so I do apply a
lip<00:01:21.930> gloss<00:01:21.960> on<00:01:22.350> top<00:01:22.560> and<00:01:22.770> I<00:01:22.860> think<00:01:23.130> I<00:01:23.220> applied

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
lip gloss on top and I think I applied

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.149 
lip gloss on top and I think I applied
once<00:01:24.060> when<00:01:24.780> I<00:01:24.810> did<00:01:25.049> just<00:01:25.229> watch<00:01:25.500> just<00:01:25.530> because

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
once when I did just watch just because

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.609 
once when I did just watch just because
I<00:01:26.220> wanted<00:01:26.460> you<00:01:26.610> to<00:01:26.640> see<00:01:27.600> how<00:01:27.780> it<00:01:27.930> looks<00:01:28.140> like<00:01:28.350> so

I wanted you to see how it looks like so

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.190

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
my next two lipsticks are slightly more

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.460

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.060 
on the PGR side I'm kind of semi color
more<00:01:35.189> water<00:01:35.549> more<00:01:35.729> on<00:01:36.000> the<00:01:36.150> undertones<00:01:36.840> so<00:01:37.650> the

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
more water more on the undertones so the

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.280 
more water more on the undertones so the
first<00:01:38.280> one<00:01:38.460> that<00:01:38.549> I<00:01:38.670> have<00:01:38.880> if<00:01:39.060> the<00:01:39.210> Kate<00:01:39.479> Moss

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.469 
first one that I have if the Kate Moss
lipstick<00:01:41.070> actually<00:01:41.549> used<00:01:41.790> from<00:01:42.030> Rimmel

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
lipstick actually used from Rimmel

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.450 
lipstick actually used from Rimmel
lasting<00:01:42.720> finish<00:01:43.229> and<00:01:43.680> you<00:01:43.829> will<00:01:43.950> probably<00:01:44.159> be

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
lasting finish and you will probably be

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.370 
lasting finish and you will probably be
able<00:01:44.520> to<00:01:44.670> tell<00:01:44.970> from<00:01:45.210> the<00:01:45.450> swatch<00:01:45.689> is<00:01:45.840> that<00:01:46.049> it

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
able to tell from the swatch is that it

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:47.679 
able to tell from the swatch is that it
is<00:01:46.680> slightly

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:47.689 
is slightly

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:52.550 
is slightly
peachy<00:01:48.689> so<00:01:49.170> it's<00:01:50.159> not<00:01:50.700> really<00:01:51.149> a<00:01:51.180> pink<00:01:51.960> nude

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
peachy so it's not really a pink nude

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.340 
peachy so it's not really a pink nude

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:53.309 
the other man's eyes shone and it is it
a<00:02:51.610> scheme<00:02:51.910> a<00:02:51.970> little<00:02:52.330> bit<00:02:52.420> more<00:02:52.569> color<00:02:52.810> on<00:02:53.170> your

00:02:53.309 --> 00:02:53.319 
a scheme a little bit more color on your

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:56.580 
a scheme a little bit more color on your
lips<00:02:53.530> so<00:02:53.860> it's<00:02:54.010> not<00:02:54.130> really<00:02:54.970> a<00:02:55.000> very<00:02:55.569> nude<00:02:56.170> nude

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
lips so it's not really a very nude nude

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:59.940 
lips so it's not really a very nude nude
so<00:02:57.310> it<00:02:58.090> won't<00:02:58.360> wash<00:02:58.690> you<00:02:58.900> out<00:02:59.080> and<00:02:59.440> in<00:02:59.920> my

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
so it won't wash you out and in my

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:01.620 
so it won't wash you out and in my
opinion<00:03:00.190> this<00:03:00.519> is<00:03:00.580> a<00:03:00.790> very<00:03:00.970> nice<00:03:01.150> limit<00:03:01.480> if

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:01.630 
opinion this is a very nice limit if

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:03.030
