00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:05.910
 how are you watching is a new video les 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.770
 I'm going to teach the utilities of the 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.519
 covered in minecraft racing las 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:13.259
 beautiful buckets that end there 

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:16.470
 1.0 I will teach you the utility that 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:18.210
 has much in the lava water that of 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.650
 know why we can enter with the 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.150
 accounts that does not matter mind 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.550
 actions to make cakes what 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.859
 matter is the water in Álava that's why 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.080
 they can make several utilities not us 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.330
 as you want to see it as for example the 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.320
 first thing I'm going to show is the speaker 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.770
 of water 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.989
 I guess many already know how to do it or 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:41.129
 in some other series as initiated the 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:44.899
 water elevator we need water 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.899
 here is a better decision 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:51.699
 but let's make a water lift 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:53.469
 let's form a block of three by 

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:55.390
 three nothing else to guide us the forces 

00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:58.359
 what is our area that we are going to occupy 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:01.600
 of the lap amount of 3 x 3 is three 

00:00:58.359 --> 00:01:03.609
 tubes for three cubes and now we go to a 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:06.130
 with the crystal not that crystal strength of 

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:07.439
 sports for putting some land where 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:09.610
 whether they can put on a poster or 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.909
 simply that we are going to form with 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:11.909
 fishes 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:19.510
 about them in this way and giving the 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:21.370
 middle block is free 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:23.980
 but let's start making tower 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:27.030
 crystal as much as you want to show because 

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:27.030
 all glass walls 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.969
 and something like that now we put between the 

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:36.560
 elevator, because those indecisions come 

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:38.659
 from this side 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.970
 like this if they want from another side 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:43.369
 we just break this of these 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:45.409
 crystals that we want but to strong 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:47.020
 there have to be less three walls and 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:49.909
 a tier so it can work 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:52.640
 then the next step the next 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:55.409
 step is to place in the second block a 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:58.289
 sign we put the sign 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:00.270
 but it does not matter that we take nothing and 

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:03.899
 in the next block we will place 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:05.819
 We place a bucket of water in the 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:08.210
 next block we will place another 

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:08.210
 poster 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.690
 we place other parts 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:18.670
 and then we put another account and so 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:21.329
 successively until the end of 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:21.329
 our elevator 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:26.290
 and our water lift is already done 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:29.180
 as we see how it works simply 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:31.550
 we enter we take a little jump and to us 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:33.770
 we want to raise that we reach the top 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:36.080
 friends is very easy and simple is not so 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:37.700
 complicated of people even doing 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:39.560
 things that we will see until always 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.450
 let's see is the infinite water well 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:44.220
 so that we have that is in the 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:45.720
 cute water elevator to river powder 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:48.510
 a test tube of water every time 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:50.250
 we need water because this is a very 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:52.650
 good use so you do not have to 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:54.840
 annoy and there and return the 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:58.380
 valley and return simply you need 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:04.290
 two buckets of water and a box of two 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:05.970
 two in a two-by- two cube or a 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:08.760
 square two by two the few 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:11.110
 blocks that I put of samson so that I 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:13.480
 could undertake 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:15.910
 like two blocks and what we need 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:19.950
 are two buckets of water to the river with 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:19.950
 certain trips we go to the river 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:26.890
 let's remove this water and let's 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.739
 place in a corner a bucket of 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:32.319
 water we go to the river for another one we grab the 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:34.420
 water and we return to with our our 

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:35.980
 vitality we put it on the opposite side 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:38.109
 of endor we wear what we put 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:40.569
 previously in this case is here and 

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:44.670
 already will be generated in the ball we can 

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:44.670
 grab with pipes that we give and this 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:48.020
 on either side 

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:58.920
 but the next thing that destination signal 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:00.510
 it is a driver generator that is 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:04.940
 button generator easier there 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:04.940
 and is to form a line sometimes 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:10.819
 a line of four blocks and we're going to 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:13.760
 fix the end blocks and we 

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:15.500
 let's put water and on the other side 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:17.180
 let's place the lava now 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:19.609
 perfectly it is now simply 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:21.709
 is going to remove this block and down where 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:24.050
 you are saying what it is always to discard 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:27.800
 the water we are going to quote another one below 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:30.639
 so that it does not become an alava now 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:34.300
 what remains is to remove this 

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:35.349
 and it will be generated automatically so is 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:38.439
 infinite 

00:04:35.349 --> 00:04:40.720
 no matter how many times you do it goes 

00:04:38.439 --> 00:04:42.760
 to regenerate the same taste 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:45.520
 with many ways to make a founder 

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:48.240
 of all my favorites is very strong 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:48.240
 they are appropriate 

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:56.140
 but this is a winner and it cost more 

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:58.740
 let's say applied more efficient more 

00:04:56.140 --> 00:05:00.930
 efficient and how do I do this 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:02.470
 conquest 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:06.250
 the meditation 

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:06.250
 3 x 3 x 3 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:10.540
 ceasefire clouds of the tree 35 

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:13.390
 points 

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:14.680
 and there is the first cube of 3 x 3 x 3 and 

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:16.840
 now let's leave a game of 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:19.650
 separation and let's make another cube of 

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:21.840
 3 x 3 x 3 

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:23.130
 this friends now in the middle of the cube 

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:26.250
 of transportation is on the top 

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:29.220
 let's remove the video and in the other 

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:30.660
 side also the other cube and now in one 

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:33.080
 of the cubes what they are going to do is 

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:33.080
 remove 

00:05:33.129 --> 00:05:36.800
 from the middle and middle of the middle with 

00:05:35.259 --> 00:05:39.949
 xstrata of the slope 

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:42.590
 in the one above they remove the cube 

00:05:39.949 --> 00:05:45.500
 this in this way easier in 1500 and 

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:48.409
 now they are going to place the water corvette 

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:50.599
 on the side where they removed in the bucket from 

00:05:48.409 --> 00:05:53.150
 glass from the opposite side go to 

00:05:50.599 --> 00:05:55.340
 place here the bucket of water and here they go 

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:58.850
 to place the lava cube 

00:05:55.340 --> 00:06:02.810
 so that it does not become a nursery of water 

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:04.460
 we are going to break this block because there it is 

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:06.900
 accumulates water and is scattered 

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:11.570
 Now let's do that 

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:11.570
 for this block of this other block 

00:06:12.169 --> 00:06:24.509
 this sophisticated because when I 

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:27.169
 we pick up we go out and it's more efficient 

00:06:24.509 --> 00:06:30.199
 in this way because you do not have to 

00:06:27.169 --> 00:06:33.120
 look at us during life there in the 

00:06:30.199 --> 00:06:36.020
 coach because you can burn and 

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:36.020
 every time you remove 

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:42.900
 to explain 

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:45.199
 there were indications of the sixth Levite 200 

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:45.199
 teams 

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:47.389
 i 

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:52.090
 2 and it's how it's done are from 

00:06:50.199 --> 00:06:52.660
 different ways of doing scenarios 

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:55.889
 together 

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:58.150
 I prefer this next form but 

00:06:55.889 --> 00:07:00.639
 Well I hope you have what 

00:06:58.150 --> 00:07:02.380
 would be everything is that again because it has 

00:07:00.639 --> 00:07:04.210
 liked to give him the ademar stay with 

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:05.979
 product of subscribing to this channel if 

00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:07.330
 you have a question, half question, I'm going to 

00:07:05.979 --> 00:07:09.500
 answer the most respect action of 

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:11.830
 minutes 

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:13.810
 post 

00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:17.370
 Well I hope you liked another 

00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:17.370
 time and see you in a new video
