white on one end and it has just seen I
can<00:03:23.540> find<00:03:23.870> it<00:03:24.139> alright<00:03:24.980> there's<00:03:25.730> another

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 
can find it alright there's another

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.289 
can find it alright there's another
public<00:03:26.389> connector<00:03:26.930> on<00:03:27.590> the<00:03:27.709> other<00:03:27.829> end<00:03:28.040> I<00:03:28.370> have

00:03:29.289 --> 00:03:29.299 
public connector on the other end I have

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:31.660 
public connector on the other end I have
no<00:03:29.480> idea<00:03:29.720> what<00:03:29.840> this<00:03:29.989> does<00:03:30.049> but<00:03:30.859> if<00:03:31.400> you<00:03:31.489> bear

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:31.670 
no idea what this does but if you bear

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:33.220 
no idea what this does but if you bear
with<00:03:31.700> me<00:03:32.030> in<00:03:32.389> the<00:03:32.540> next<00:03:32.750> video

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:33.230 
with me in the next video

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:39.550 
with me in the next video
it<00:03:33.739> all<00:03:33.920> comes<00:03:34.190> together<00:03:37.900> we<00:03:38.900> have<00:03:39.199> the

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:39.560 
it all comes together we have the

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:45.039 
it all comes together we have the
British<00:03:40.540> three-pin<00:03:41.540> plug<00:03:42.220> standard<00:03:43.220> and<00:03:44.049> I

00:03:45.039 --> 00:03:45.049 
British three-pin plug standard and I

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:48.780 
British three-pin plug standard and I
guess<00:03:45.709> this<00:03:46.160> would<00:03:46.400> be<00:03:46.669> for<00:03:47.000> the<00:03:47.030> chargers<00:03:47.540> so

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790 
guess this would be for the chargers so

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:51.310 
guess this would be for the chargers so
here's<00:03:49.790> the<00:03:50.030> battery<00:03:50.239> itself<00:03:50.780> but<00:03:51.079> it<00:03:51.199> looks

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:51.320 
here's the battery itself but it looks

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:51.759 
here's the battery itself but it looks
of<00:03:51.500> it

00:03:51.759 --> 00:03:51.769 
of it

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:56.839 
of it
yeah<00:03:53.109> and<00:03:54.250> carry<00:03:55.250> strap

00:03:56.839 --> 00:03:56.849 
yeah and carry strap

00:03:56.849 --> 00:04:00.490 
yeah and carry strap
and<00:03:57.360> what<00:03:57.510> else<00:03:57.629> to<00:03:57.810> get<00:03:57.959> in<00:03:58.019> the<00:03:58.079> box<00:03:58.849> nothing

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:00.500 
and what else to get in the box nothing

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:04.990 
and what else to get in the box nothing
totally<00:04:01.500> empty<00:04:02.129> right<00:04:02.959> okay<00:04:03.959> so<00:04:04.019> to<00:04:04.290> recap

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:05.000 
totally empty right okay so to recap

totally empty right okay so to recap
we've<00:04:06.000> got<00:04:06.469> battery<00:04:08.480> we<00:04:09.480> have<00:04:09.719> the<00:04:10.079> British

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:10.890 
we've got battery we have the British
