and physics courses and in math courses
your<00:00:03.000> teachers<00:00:03.419> will<00:00:03.629> sometimes<00:00:04.529> ask<00:00:04.740> you<00:00:04.980> to

00:00:05.059 --> 00:00:05.069 
your teachers will sometimes ask you to

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:07.419 
your teachers will sometimes ask you to
write<00:00:05.220> numbers<00:00:05.580> in<00:00:05.730> scientific<00:00:06.420> notation

00:00:07.419 --> 00:00:07.429 
write numbers in scientific notation

00:00:07.429 --> 00:00:10.009 
write numbers in scientific notation
it's<00:00:08.429> just<00:00:08.910> the<00:00:09.000> notation<00:00:09.450> that<00:00:09.480> they<00:00:09.719> prefer

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
it's just the notation that they prefer

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.459 
it's just the notation that they prefer
why<00:00:10.230> I'm<00:00:10.559> not<00:00:10.889> quite<00:00:11.099> sure<00:00:11.660> but<00:00:12.660> basically<00:00:13.320> it

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
why I'm not quite sure but basically it

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.709 
why I'm not quite sure but basically it
means<00:00:13.500> take<00:00:14.040> this<00:00:14.250> decimal<00:00:14.639> point<00:00:15.059> or<00:00:15.480> this

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
means take this decimal point or this

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:17.359 
means take this decimal point or this
floating<00:00:16.170> point<00:00:16.289> is<00:00:16.740> I'll<00:00:16.859> call<00:00:17.100> it<00:00:17.190> in<00:00:17.279> these

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
floating point is I'll call it in these

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.750 
floating point is I'll call it in these
videos<00:00:17.699> and<00:00:18.660> move<00:00:18.900> it<00:00:19.080> between<00:00:19.439> the<00:00:19.859> first<00:00:20.520> and

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
videos and move it between the first and

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.050 
videos and move it between the first and
second<00:00:21.570> digit<00:00:22.020> in<00:00:22.199> the<00:00:22.320> number<00:00:22.730> so<00:00:23.730> if<00:00:23.820> I<00:00:23.910> take

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
second digit in the number so if I take

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.240 
second digit in the number so if I take
this<00:00:24.240> decimal<00:00:24.480> this<00:00:25.019> sorry<00:00:25.680> you<00:00:26.070> mean

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
this decimal this sorry you mean

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.640 
this decimal this sorry you mean
floating<00:00:26.640> point<00:00:26.910> and<00:00:27.199> I<00:00:28.199> put<00:00:28.439> it<00:00:28.529> right<00:00:28.590> here

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
floating point and I put it right here

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.800 
floating point and I put it right here
in<00:00:29.490> fact<00:00:29.699> that's<00:00:29.849> why<00:00:30.000> we<00:00:30.119> call<00:00:30.330> it<00:00:30.359> floating

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
in fact that's why we call it floating

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.530 
in fact that's why we call it floating
point<00:00:31.019> is<00:00:31.170> I'm<00:00:31.289> floating<00:00:31.980> this<00:00:32.070> point<00:00:32.540> either

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
point is I'm floating this point either

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:34.940 
point is I'm floating this point either
to<00:00:33.780> the<00:00:33.899> left<00:00:33.930> or<00:00:34.170> the<00:00:34.260> right<00:00:34.290> in<00:00:34.590> this<00:00:34.710> case

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
to the left or the right in this case

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.389 
to the left or the right in this case
I'm<00:00:35.160> doing<00:00:35.190> it<00:00:35.489> to<00:00:35.579> the<00:00:35.700> left<00:00:36.980> and<00:00:37.980> I<00:00:38.100> float<00:00:38.309> it

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
I'm doing it to the left and I float it

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.520 
I'm doing it to the left and I float it
to<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:38.610> left<00:00:38.790> to<00:00:38.879> compensate<00:00:39.480> for<00:00:39.629> that<00:00:39.690> then

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
to the left to compensate for that then

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.880 
to the left to compensate for that then
I<00:00:40.860> need<00:00:41.040> to<00:00:41.190> times<00:00:41.460> up<00:00:41.730> by<00:00:41.850> 10<00:00:42.210> to<00:00:42.629> the<00:00:42.960> 2<00:00:43.590> and

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
I need to times up by 10 to the 2 and

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.479 
I need to times up by 10 to the 2 and
this<00:00:44.579> is<00:00:44.640> the<00:00:45.079> scientific<00:00:46.079> notation<00:00:46.680> of<00:00:46.890> this

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
this is the scientific notation of this

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.260 
this is the scientific notation of this
number<00:00:47.730> up<00:00:48.059> here<00:00:49.010> well<00:00:50.010> if<00:00:50.219> I<00:00:50.610> took<00:00:50.940> that<00:00:51.120> a

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
number up here well if I took that a

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.160 
number up here well if I took that a
little<00:00:51.510> further<00:00:51.750> and<00:00:51.989> I<00:00:53.660> don't<00:00:54.660> really<00:00:54.899> need

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
little further and I don't really need

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.600 
little further and I don't really need
to<00:00:55.230> tell<00:00:55.350> you<00:00:55.559> the<00:00:55.800> 10<00:00:56.010> that<00:00:56.219> 10<00:00:56.430> is<00:00:56.579> just

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
to tell you the 10 that 10 is just

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.360 
to tell you the 10 that 10 is just
assumed<00:00:57.300> in<00:00:57.960> fact<00:00:58.289> in<00:00:58.469> my<00:00:58.770> notice<00:00:59.190> of<00:00:59.280> my

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
assumed in fact in my notice of my

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.700 
assumed in fact in my notice of my
scientific<00:00:59.789> calculators<00:01:00.420> it'll<00:01:01.109> it'll<00:01:01.410> give

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
scientific calculators it'll it'll give

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.729 
scientific calculators it'll it'll give
the<00:01:02.160> this<00:01:02.910> value<00:01:03.420> here<00:01:03.870> and<00:01:04.229> it'll<00:01:04.439> give<00:01:04.589> the

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
the this value here and it'll give the

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.890 
the this value here and it'll give the
power<00:01:04.979> but<00:01:05.430> it<00:01:05.519> won't<00:01:05.729> necessarily<00:01:05.820> say<00:01:06.600> times

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
power but it won't necessarily say times

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.460 
power but it won't necessarily say times
10<00:01:07.200> to<00:01:07.290> the<00:01:07.320> 2<00:01:07.530> it<00:01:07.680> just<00:01:07.860> says<00:01:08.369> e<00:01:08.520> which<00:01:09.470> means

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
10 to the 2 it just says e which means

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.410 
10 to the 2 it just says e which means
I'm<00:01:10.950> supposed<00:01:11.130> to<00:01:11.400> put<00:01:11.610> a<00:01:11.640> 10<00:01:12.000> there<00:01:12.180> are<00:01:12.270> times

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
I'm supposed to put a 10 there are times

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.950 
I'm supposed to put a 10 there are times
a<00:01:12.570> times<00:01:12.750> 10<00:01:13.049> to<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.229> to<00:01:13.439> the<00:01:13.860> 10<00:01:14.070> is<00:01:14.220> assumed

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:14.960 
a times 10 to the to the 10 is assumed

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.010 
a times 10 to the to the 10 is assumed
so<00:01:16.850> moving<00:01:17.850> on<00:01:17.970> from<00:01:18.000> there<00:01:18.299> if<00:01:18.420> I<00:01:18.509> give<00:01:18.810> you

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
so moving on from there if I give you

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.359 
so moving on from there if I give you
another<00:01:19.590> decimal<00:01:20.220> point<00:01:20.490> value<00:01:20.939> and<00:01:22.369> simply

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
another decimal point value and simply

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:28.580 
another decimal point value and simply
an<00:01:23.460> exponent<00:01:23.909> let's<00:01:24.270> say<00:01:24.689> let's<00:01:25.650> do<00:01:25.799> 4<00:01:27.590> then

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
an exponent let's say let's do 4 then

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.580 
an exponent let's say let's do 4 then
here<00:01:29.520> here's<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.180> number<00:01:30.479> here's<00:01:30.509> a<00:01:30.840> 4<00:01:31.170> in

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
here here's the number here's a 4 in

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.740 
here here's the number here's a 4 in
fact<00:01:31.920> let's<00:01:32.100> even<00:01:32.280> be<00:01:32.430> more<00:01:32.640> let's<00:01:33.360> go<00:01:33.420> back<00:01:33.630> to

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
fact let's even be more let's go back to

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.090 
fact let's even be more let's go back to
what<00:01:33.869> physics<00:01:34.200> teachers<00:01:34.470> lines<00:01:34.680> can<00:01:34.890> put<00:01:35.040> it

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
what physics teachers lines can put it

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.640 
what physics teachers lines can put it
in<00:01:35.189> the<00:01:35.250> right<00:01:35.400> in<00:01:35.610> the<00:01:35.790> correct<00:01:36.030> location<00:01:36.650> so

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
in the right in the correct location so

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:42.740 
in the right in the correct location so
if<00:01:37.799> I<00:01:37.950> give<00:01:38.130> you<00:01:38.280> this<00:01:40.130> value<00:01:41.299> which<00:01:42.299> is<00:01:42.329> called

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
if I give you this value which is called

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.380 
if I give you this value which is called
here's<00:01:43.020> the<00:01:43.110> technical<00:01:43.350> term<00:01:43.729> mantissa<00:01:44.729> if<00:01:45.270> I

here's the technical term mantissa if I

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.289 
here's the technical term mantissa if I
give<00:01:45.540> you<00:01:45.630> the<00:01:45.810> mantissa<00:01:46.350> and<00:01:46.680> the<00:01:47.640> exponent

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
give you the mantissa and the exponent

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:49.789 
give you the mantissa and the exponent
using<00:01:48.600> those<00:01:48.750> two<00:01:48.960> things<00:01:49.259> you<00:01:49.530> should<00:01:49.710> be

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
using those two things you should be

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.440 
using those two things you should be
able<00:01:49.890> to<00:01:50.070> figure<00:01:50.369> out<00:01:50.490> the<00:01:50.640> actual<00:01:50.820> value<00:01:51.360> of

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
able to figure out the actual value of

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.440 
able to figure out the actual value of
this<00:01:51.600> number<00:01:51.810> well<00:01:52.740> it's<00:01:52.860> simple<00:01:53.159> I<00:01:53.450> could

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
this number well it's simple I could

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.410 
this number well it's simple I could
write<00:01:54.689> it<00:01:54.840> out<00:01:54.960> longhand<00:01:55.680> and<00:01:56.040> say<00:01:57.030> well<00:01:57.270> this

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
write it out longhand and say well this

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:03.560 
write it out longhand and say well this
is<00:01:57.689> that<00:01:58.430> times<00:01:59.430> 10<00:02:00.119> to<00:02:00.659> the<00:02:02.090> 20<00:02:03.090> known<00:02:03.299> on

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
is that times 10 to the 20 known on

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.560 
is that times 10 to the 20 known on
twenty<00:02:03.840> ten<00:02:04.170> to<00:02:05.009> the<00:02:05.040> power<00:02:05.360> but<00:02:06.360> I<00:02:06.390> really

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
twenty ten to the power but I really

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.690 
twenty ten to the power but I really
don't<00:02:06.719> need<00:02:06.810> to<00:02:06.930> look<00:02:07.200> at<00:02:07.320> the<00:02:07.500> the<00:02:07.530> 10<00:02:08.099> to<00:02:08.489> the

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
don't need to look at the the 10 to the

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.199 
don't need to look at the the 10 to the
I<00:02:09.590> all<00:02:10.590> I<00:02:10.649> really<00:02:10.860> need<00:02:11.160> is<00:02:11.190> the<00:02:11.459> 4<00:02:11.700> and<00:02:12.000> the<00:02:12.060> 4

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
I all I really need is the 4 and the 4

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.490 
I all I really need is the 4 and the 4
says<00:02:12.569> you<00:02:12.810> know<00:02:12.930> what

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
says you know what

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.040 
says you know what
move<00:02:13.890> the<00:02:14.100> decimal<00:02:14.250> point<00:02:14.730> to<00:02:14.880> the<00:02:14.910> right<00:02:15.050> four

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
move the decimal point to the right four

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:18.410 
move the decimal point to the right four
digits<00:02:16.500> so<00:02:17.400> yeah<00:02:17.580> I<00:02:17.610> could<00:02:17.880> write<00:02:18.060> it<00:02:18.180> out<00:02:18.300> this

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
digits so yeah I could write it out this

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.690 
digits so yeah I could write it out this
long<00:02:18.690> way<00:02:18.870> but<00:02:18.930> it's<00:02:19.350> not<00:02:19.440> necessary<00:02:19.920> let's

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
long way but it's not necessary let's

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.070 
long way but it's not necessary let's
just<00:02:20.940> do<00:02:21.060> it<00:02:21.150> the<00:02:21.240> easy<00:02:21.390> way<00:02:21.540> I'm<00:02:21.780> just<00:02:21.840> going

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
just do it the easy way I'm just going

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.660 
just do it the easy way I'm just going
to<00:02:22.230> say<00:02:22.380> okay<00:02:22.560> well<00:02:22.770> let's<00:02:23.010> move<00:02:23.190> the<00:02:23.340> decimal

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
to say okay well let's move the decimal

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.300 
to say okay well let's move the decimal
point<00:02:23.880> over<00:02:24.170> to<00:02:25.170> the<00:02:25.260> right<00:02:25.440> four<00:02:25.800> digits<00:02:26.130> so

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
point over to the right four digits so

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.460 
point over to the right four digits so
one<00:02:26.640> two<00:02:26.910> three<00:02:26.940> four<00:02:27.270> so<00:02:27.930> that<00:02:27.960> means<00:02:28.290> the

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
one two three four so that means the

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:29.900 
one two three four so that means the
decimal<00:02:28.620> point<00:02:29.010> will<00:02:29.130> move<00:02:29.220> to<00:02:29.370> here<00:02:29.610> or<00:02:29.790> it

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
decimal point will move to here or it

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:35.480 
decimal point will move to here or it
floats<00:02:30.590> to<00:02:31.590> the<00:02:31.709> right<00:02:31.890> four<00:02:33.170> so<00:02:34.190> this<00:02:35.190> value

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:35.490 
floats to the right four so this value

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:39.920 
floats to the right four so this value
and<00:02:35.910> this<00:02:36.120> value<00:02:36.860> are<00:02:37.860> the<00:02:37.980> same<00:02:38.660> well<00:02:39.660> guess

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
and this value are the same well guess

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.240 
and this value are the same well guess
what<00:02:40.170> in<00:02:40.830> binary<00:02:41.310> it<00:02:41.610> works<00:02:41.810> identically<00:02:42.810> so

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
what in binary it works identically so

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:46.550 
what in binary it works identically so
identically<00:02:44.250> sorry<00:02:45.050> so<00:02:46.050> let<00:02:46.170> me<00:02:46.260> give<00:02:46.380> you<00:02:46.470> a

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
identically sorry so let me give you a

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.220 
identically sorry so let me give you a
binary<00:02:46.860> number<00:02:47.100> 1<00:02:47.459> 1<00:02:47.730> 0<00:02:48.000> and<00:02:48.300> put<00:02:48.810> a<00:02:48.870> decimal

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
binary number 1 1 0 and put a decimal

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:50.720 
binary number 1 1 0 and put a decimal
point<00:02:49.290> in<00:02:49.680> there<00:02:49.800> and<00:02:49.980> in<00:02:50.070> fact<00:02:50.310> let's<00:02:50.550> go<00:02:50.610> back

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
point in there and in fact let's go back

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.210 
point in there and in fact let's go back
to<00:02:51.030> scientific<00:02:51.600> notation<00:02:51.720> let's<00:02:52.650> let's<00:02:52.920> drop

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
to scientific notation let's let's drop

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.280 
to scientific notation let's let's drop
that<00:02:53.280> up<00:02:53.520> there<00:02:53.700> and<00:02:54.000> then<00:02:54.300> I<00:02:54.780> need<00:02:55.050> to<00:02:55.140> give

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
that up there and then I need to give

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.380 
that up there and then I need to give
you<00:02:55.380> a<00:02:55.410> binary<00:02:56.130> exponent<00:02:56.910> I<00:02:56.940> can't<00:02:57.150> give<00:02:57.300> you<00:02:57.330> a

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
you a binary exponent I can't give you a

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:59.390 
you a binary exponent I can't give you a
decimal<00:02:57.720> exponent<00:02:58.530> because<00:02:58.739> we<00:02:58.920> are<00:02:59.130> in

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
decimal exponent because we are in

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.610 
decimal exponent because we are in
binary<00:02:59.970> so<00:03:00.390> let<00:03:00.630> me<00:03:00.690> give<00:03:00.840> you<00:03:00.930> a<00:03:01.110> binary

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
binary so let me give you a binary

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.070 
binary so let me give you a binary
exponent<00:03:02.400> so<00:03:02.580> what<00:03:03.150> is<00:03:03.270> this<00:03:03.450> value<00:03:03.600> in<00:03:03.870> binary

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
exponent so what is this value in binary

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:08.810 
exponent so what is this value in binary
well<00:03:04.560> it's<00:03:04.860> 4<00:03:05.450> plus<00:03:06.450> 2<00:03:06.720> which<00:03:07.200> is<00:03:07.350> 6<00:03:07.620> which<00:03:08.550> I

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:08.820 
well it's 4 plus 2 which is 6 which I

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:10.520 
well it's 4 plus 2 which is 6 which I
could<00:03:09.090> write<00:03:09.300> out<00:03:09.480> the<00:03:09.630> long<00:03:09.810> way<00:03:09.840> and<00:03:10.260> say

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
could write out the long way and say

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.640 
could write out the long way and say
it's<00:03:10.920> the<00:03:11.310> mantissa<00:03:11.910> time<00:03:12.570> oh<00:03:12.930> excuse<00:03:13.500> me

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
it's the mantissa time oh excuse me

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:16.880 
it's the mantissa time oh excuse me
it's<00:03:14.010> the<00:03:14.220> mantissa<00:03:14.670> times<00:03:15.660> 2<00:03:16.140> to<00:03:16.500> the<00:03:16.530> power

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
it's the mantissa times 2 to the power

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:19.880 
it's the mantissa times 2 to the power
but<00:03:17.730> really<00:03:18.030> what<00:03:18.269> this<00:03:18.450> is<00:03:18.630> saying<00:03:18.840> is<00:03:19.170> move

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
but really what this is saying is move

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:22.580 
but really what this is saying is move
the<00:03:20.100> decimal<00:03:20.459> point<00:03:20.640> over<00:03:20.940> to<00:03:21.390> the<00:03:21.630> right<00:03:21.840> 6

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
the decimal point over to the right 6

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:25.490 
the decimal point over to the right 6
places<00:03:23.220> so<00:03:23.940> let's<00:03:24.150> do<00:03:24.269> that<00:03:24.480> I'll<00:03:24.690> drop<00:03:25.350> the

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
places so let's do that I'll drop the

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.190 
places so let's do that I'll drop the
number<00:03:25.680> down<00:03:25.799> here<00:03:25.830> and<00:03:26.250> let's<00:03:26.459> go<00:03:26.610> 1<00:03:26.850> 2<00:03:27.180> 3<00:03:27.209> 4<00:03:27.600> 5

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
number down here and let's go 1 2 3 4 5

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.479 
number down here and let's go 1 2 3 4 5
6<00:03:28.590> so<00:03:29.489> the<00:03:29.640> decimal<00:03:29.790> point<00:03:30.209> needs<00:03:31.019> to<00:03:31.110> go<00:03:31.260> there

00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:31.489 
6 so the decimal point needs to go there

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:34.789 
6 so the decimal point needs to go there
remove<00:03:32.489> it<00:03:32.640> from<00:03:32.790> here<00:03:33.209> we<00:03:33.900> just<00:03:34.080> evaluated

00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:34.799 
remove it from here we just evaluated

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:36.680 
remove it from here we just evaluated
the<00:03:34.920> exponents<00:03:35.700> so<00:03:35.730> I<00:03:35.880> can<00:03:36.150> delete<00:03:36.480> the

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
the exponents so I can delete the

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:40.640 
the exponents so I can delete the
exponent<00:03:37.260> and<00:03:37.549> so<00:03:38.549> this<00:03:39.330> binary<00:03:39.900> value<00:03:40.350> is

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
exponent and so this binary value is

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:44.199 
exponent and so this binary value is
equal<00:03:41.340> to<00:03:41.459> this<00:03:41.610> binary<00:03:41.940> value<00:03:42.590> and<00:03:43.590> that's<00:03:43.769> it

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:44.209 
equal to this binary value and that's it

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:48.560 
equal to this binary value and that's it
so<00:03:45.209> so<00:03:46.110> if<00:03:46.350> we<00:03:46.590> go<00:03:46.739> to<00:03:46.769> the<00:03:47.220> chart<00:03:48.060> which<00:03:48.239> we<00:03:48.390> saw

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:48.570 
so so if we go to the chart which we saw

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:51.620 
so so if we go to the chart which we saw
in<00:03:48.870> the<00:03:49.290> in<00:03:49.799> the<00:03:50.010> reading<00:03:50.310> on<00:03:50.489> page<00:03:50.700> 100<00:03:51.209> you

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:51.630 
in the in the reading on page 100 you

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:53.840 
in the in the reading on page 100 you
saw<00:03:51.810> something<00:03:52.200> similar<00:03:52.470> to<00:03:52.590> this<00:03:52.739> there<00:03:53.610> is

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:53.850 
saw something similar to this there is

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:55.789 
saw something similar to this there is
the<00:03:54.060> exponent<00:03:54.600> and<00:03:54.959> there<00:03:55.170> is<00:03:55.290> the<00:03:55.410> mantissa

00:03:55.789 --> 00:03:55.799 
the exponent and there is the mantissa

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:58.100 
the exponent and there is the mantissa
and<00:03:56.130> there's<00:03:56.820> also<00:03:56.970> the<00:03:57.150> sign<00:03:57.360> bit<00:03:57.660> which<00:03:57.870> I'm

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:58.110 
and there's also the sign bit which I'm

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:59.870 
and there's also the sign bit which I'm
going<00:03:58.290> to<00:03:58.380> kind<00:03:58.560> of<00:03:58.650> ignore<00:03:58.799> it's<00:03:59.250> just

00:03:59.870 --> 00:03:59.880 
going to kind of ignore it's just

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:01.039 
going to kind of ignore it's just
determines<00:04:00.269> if<00:04:00.360> it's<00:04:00.510> negative<00:04:00.810> or<00:04:00.900> positive

00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:01.049 
determines if it's negative or positive

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:03.710 
determines if it's negative or positive
the<00:04:01.739> exponent<00:04:02.190> in<00:04:02.250> the<00:04:02.310> mantissa<00:04:02.700> are<00:04:03.239> really

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720 
the exponent in the mantissa are really

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:05.449 
the exponent in the mantissa are really
the<00:04:03.870> things<00:04:04.410> we<00:04:04.620> need<00:04:04.769> to<00:04:04.920> spend<00:04:05.250> some<00:04:05.400> time

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:05.459 
the things we need to spend some time

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:08.630 
the things we need to spend some time
understanding<00:04:05.820> the<00:04:06.810> the<00:04:07.200> exponent<00:04:07.769> is<00:04:07.890> just

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:08.640 
understanding the the exponent is just

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:12.110 
understanding the the exponent is just
what<00:04:08.760> we<00:04:08.850> saw<00:04:09.060> over<00:04:09.450> here<00:04:10.250> where<00:04:11.250> it's<00:04:11.820> it's

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
what we saw over here where it's it's

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:15.229 
what we saw over here where it's it's
this<00:04:12.299> power<00:04:12.540> or<00:04:12.870> exponent<00:04:13.940> and<00:04:14.940> then<00:04:15.120> the

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:15.239 
this power or exponent and then the

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:18.080 
this power or exponent and then the
mantissa<00:04:15.570> the<00:04:15.930> mantissa<00:04:16.290> is<00:04:16.739> is<00:04:17.459> the<00:04:17.760> floating

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
mantissa the mantissa is is the floating

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:23.180 
mantissa the mantissa is is the floating
point<00:04:18.299> type<00:04:19.019> of<00:04:19.200> thing<00:04:20.239> so<00:04:21.239> so<00:04:21.780> that<00:04:22.080> when<00:04:23.070> you

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
point type of thing so so that when you

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:26.810 
point type of thing so so that when you
see<00:04:23.400> a<00:04:24.169> see<00:04:25.169> in<00:04:25.260> the<00:04:25.349> book<00:04:25.470> it<00:04:25.650> talks<00:04:25.860> about<00:04:26.039> a

it's<00:04:34.290> talking<00:04:34.410> about<00:04:34.650> same<00:04:35.400> thing<00:04:35.610> with

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:35.730 
it's talking about same thing with

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:39.530 
it's talking about same thing with
regardless<00:04:36.240> of<00:04:36.360> its<00:04:36.480> base<00:04:36.630> 10<00:04:36.900> or<00:04:37.110> base<00:04:37.230> 2
