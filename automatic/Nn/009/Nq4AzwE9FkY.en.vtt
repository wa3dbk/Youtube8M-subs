if you have lost a single tooth you have

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:04.760 
if you have lost a single tooth you have
various<00:00:03.210> tooth<00:00:03.480> replacement<00:00:04.140> options<00:00:04.500> to

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:07.180 

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:09.460 

one<00:00:08.180> option<00:00:08.630> would<00:00:08.750> be<00:00:08.810> a<00:00:08.960> single<00:00:09.290> tooth

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:09.470

a<00:00:12.710> major<00:00:13.710> consequence<00:00:14.490> of<00:00:14.700> this<00:00:14.820> option<00:00:15.330> is

a major consequence of this option is

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.930 
a major consequence of this option is
the<00:00:16.049> bone<00:00:16.230> loss<00:00:16.470> that<00:00:16.770> occurs<00:00:17.100> due<00:00:17.610> to<00:00:17.640> the
