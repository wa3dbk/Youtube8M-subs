I've<00:00:06.650> loved<00:00:07.190> always<00:00:07.910> writing<00:00:08.210> with<00:00:08.630> someone

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:09.050 
I've loved always writing with someone

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:10.680 
I've loved always writing with someone
and<00:00:09.230> you<00:00:09.980> see

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:10.690 
and you see

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:13.140

though official wanders technically I've

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:14.669 
though official wanders technically I've

00:00:14.669 --> 00:00:14.679 
given the screen captain credit I

00:00:14.679 --> 00:00:16.920 
given the screen captain credit I
figured<00:00:15.039> the<00:00:15.190> story<00:00:15.580> out<00:00:15.789> would<00:00:16.029> did<00:00:16.270> Charlie

about<00:00:22.840> working<00:00:23.380> with<00:00:23.860> someone<00:00:24.099> is<00:00:24.550> that<00:00:24.789> you

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:24.910 
about working with someone is that you

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:26.729 
about working with someone is that you
get<00:00:25.150> to<00:00:25.300> a<00:00:25.329> place<00:00:25.570> you'd<00:00:25.900> never<00:00:26.169> get<00:00:26.439> on<00:00:26.590> your

I love having people come in I'd like to

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:38.410 
percent to say I like everyone about 40

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:39.869 
percent to say I like everyone about 40
percent<00:00:38.590> of<00:00:38.950> it<00:00:39.039> and<00:00:39.219> then<00:00:39.340> hearing<00:00:39.730> what

00:00:39.869 --> 00:00:39.879 
percent of it and then hearing what

everyone else so if there's something I

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.770 
everyone else so if there's something I
really<00:00:41.829> like<00:00:42.309> or<00:00:42.699> really<00:00:42.969> don't<00:00:43.179> like<00:00:43.420> then<00:00:43.690> I

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:43.780 
really like or really don't like then I

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:46.319 
really like or really don't like then I
can<00:00:44.050> prevail<00:00:44.559> but<00:00:45.309> if<00:00:45.460> I<00:00:45.609> discover<00:00:45.999> people

00:00:46.319 --> 00:00:46.329 
can prevail but if I discover people

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:48.209 
can prevail but if I discover people
don't<00:00:46.629> like<00:00:46.899> things<00:00:47.230> I<00:00:47.409> really<00:00:47.769> listen<00:00:48.100> to

00:00:48.209 --> 00:00:48.219 
don't like things I really listen to

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:52.580 
don't like things I really listen to
them<00:00:48.370> and<00:00:48.489> I<00:00:48.579> think<00:00:48.640> that<00:00:48.969> makes<00:00:49.210> it<00:00:49.420> better

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.160 

there's<00:00:53.100> a<00:00:53.219> strange<00:00:54.000> thing<00:00:54.360> about<00:00:54.480> my<00:00:54.840> mind

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
there's a strange thing about my mind

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.900 
there's a strange thing about my mind
and<00:00:55.410> I<00:00:55.469> think<00:00:55.770> a<00:00:55.860> lot<00:00:56.039> of<00:00:56.190> writers<00:00:56.430> are<00:00:56.760> like

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
and I think a lot of writers are like

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.500 
and I think a lot of writers are like
this<00:00:57.410> it's<00:00:58.410> very<00:00:58.800> hard<00:00:59.219> to<00:00:59.519> get<00:00:59.699> plot<00:01:00.120> and

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
this it's very hard to get plot and

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.299 
this it's very hard to get plot and
character<00:01:01.640> balanced<00:01:02.989> rightly<00:01:03.989> I<00:01:04.650> used<00:01:05.159> to

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
character balanced rightly I used to

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.760 
character balanced rightly I used to
think<00:01:05.610> for<00:01:05.880> example<00:01:05.940> Mike<00:01:06.509> Lee's<00:01:06.840> early<00:01:07.440> stuff

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
think for example Mike Lee's early stuff

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.580 
think for example Mike Lee's early stuff
earlier<00:01:08.310> work<00:01:08.580> was<00:01:08.960> fantastic<00:01:09.960> on<00:01:10.110> character

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
earlier work was fantastic on character

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.880 
earlier work was fantastic on character
I<00:01:10.619> mean<00:01:10.710> it<00:01:10.860> was<00:01:11.040> love<00:01:11.759> s<00:01:11.970> being<00:01:12.360> done<00:01:12.690> but<00:01:13.530> very

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
I mean it was love s being done but very

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.030 
I mean it was love s being done but very
frequently<00:01:14.580> the<00:01:15.360> endings<00:01:15.899> of<00:01:16.200> his<00:01:16.710> plays

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
frequently the endings of his plays

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.280 
frequently the endings of his plays
didn't<00:01:18.030> work<00:01:18.180> particularly<00:01:18.630> well<00:01:18.869> because

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
didn't work particularly well because

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:20.870 
didn't work particularly well because
people<00:01:19.409> had<00:01:19.799> to<00:01:19.890> have<00:01:19.979> heart<00:01:20.280> attacks<00:01:20.670> that

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
people had to have heart attacks that

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.300 
people had to have heart attacks that
sort<00:01:21.149> of<00:01:21.240> thing<00:01:21.390> because<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:22.530> the<00:01:22.830> plot<00:01:23.070> was

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
sort of thing because the the plot was

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.550 
sort of thing because the the plot was
being<00:01:23.580> neglected<00:01:24.180> when<00:01:24.600> I'm<00:01:24.780> writing<00:01:25.050> movies

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
being neglected when I'm writing movies

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.350 
being neglected when I'm writing movies
I<00:01:25.740> find<00:01:26.039> and<00:01:26.220> I<00:01:26.310> tend<00:01:26.580> to<00:01:26.610> write<00:01:26.789> one<00:01:27.060> draft

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
I find and I tend to write one draft

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.730 
I find and I tend to write one draft
where<00:01:27.600> I'm<00:01:27.690> trying<00:01:27.899> to<00:01:27.990> get<00:01:28.140> the<00:01:28.259> plot<00:01:28.470> right

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
where I'm trying to get the plot right

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.040 
where I'm trying to get the plot right
and<00:01:28.979> then<00:01:29.100> I<00:01:29.130> do<00:01:29.250> another<00:01:29.369> draft<00:01:29.970> in<00:01:30.630> which<00:01:30.840> I'm

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:31.050 
and then I do another draft in which I'm

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:33.320 
and then I do another draft in which I'm
altering<00:01:31.619> the<00:01:31.740> character<00:01:32.310> and<00:01:32.550> by<00:01:33.090> going

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:33.330 
altering the character and by going

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:35.029 
altering the character and by going
backwards<00:01:33.690> and<00:01:34.050> forwards<00:01:34.470> on<00:01:34.590> different

00:01:35.029 --> 00:01:35.039 
backwards and forwards on different

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:36.710 
backwards and forwards on different
drafts<00:01:35.340> I<00:01:35.580> can<00:01:35.759> get<00:01:35.940> them<00:01:36.090> both<00:01:36.210> together<00:01:36.450> it

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
drafts I can get them both together it

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.620 
drafts I can get them both together it
seems<00:01:36.990> to<00:01:37.170> be<00:01:37.259> very<00:01:37.440> hard<00:01:37.800> for<00:01:38.520> me<00:01:38.729> sometimes

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
seems to be very hard for me sometimes

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.559 
seems to be very hard for me sometimes
to<00:01:40.259> hold<00:01:40.619> plot<00:01:40.979> and<00:01:41.280> character<00:01:41.970> together<00:01:42.179> at

00:01:42.559 --> 00:01:42.569 
to hold plot and character together at

00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:45.080 
to hold plot and character together at
the<00:01:42.690> same<00:01:42.899> time<00:01:43.200> and<00:01:43.950> sometimes<00:01:44.429> we<00:01:44.640> get<00:01:44.789> stuck

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
the same time and sometimes we get stuck

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.540 
the same time and sometimes we get stuck
on<00:01:45.270> a<00:01:45.300> plot<00:01:45.630> and<00:01:45.929> go<00:01:46.679> off<00:01:46.860> and<00:01:47.069> start<00:01:47.280> another

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:47.550 
on a plot and go off and start another

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:49.850 
on a plot and go off and start another
episode<00:01:48.119> and<00:01:48.420> then<00:01:48.990> come<00:01:49.289> back<00:01:49.319> to<00:01:49.500> the<00:01:49.740> other

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
episode and then come back to the other

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.320 
episode and then come back to the other
episode<00:01:50.340> later<00:01:50.640> and<00:01:50.940> it<00:01:51.000> was<00:01:51.119> wonderful

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:51.330 
episode later and it was wonderful
