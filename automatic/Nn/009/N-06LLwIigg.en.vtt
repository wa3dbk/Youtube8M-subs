00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.270
 [Music] 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.760
 let's use the 2d nozzle and some 

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:15.540
 how many silver pearls 

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:20.150
 we started putting the mouthpiece 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:23.040
 perpendicular in the center and we push 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:24.840
 we stop and we raise is very important 

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:26.190
 that before going up we stop because if not 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.010
 the flower will not come out 

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:31.600
 perfect you know 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:35.410
 now let's make a side 

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:38.350
 touching the surface we push 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:40.390
 and we raise and we have the second 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:43.750
 Now we are turning, we are doing as 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:47.320
 a small circle of flowers always with 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:50.970
 the same technique very carefully not 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.970
 lift before stopping 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:56.480
 do not worry if this layer comes out 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:01:00.380
 very good because now we are going to make you 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:02.600
 one layer up would already be the first layer 

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:05.090
 and now let's make a circular or 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:07.160
 here a circle that will give us a little 

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:08.950
 more volume to the gap instead of 

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:12.410
 start at the center we started right 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:16.940
 around the first flower we push 

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:20.360
 we separate we push and we stop we push 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:22.160
 if we stop we push and we stop and 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:24.380
 we push and we stop and now that's how 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:28.700
 we give a third height placing in the 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:31.370
 center the last flower we raise now 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:34.550
 we are going to place a silver pearl in 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:36.510
 each center we will start in the 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:38.340
 first 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:41.280
 the pearls are sugar cubes 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:44.040
 completely edible we place it with 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.110
 very careful in the center if we are 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:50.030
 move we can help it from a toothpick 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.030
 teeth that will help us to place it 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:55.890
 we put the following one and we are covering 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:57.840
 all centers with balls 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.979
 as the center is well defined no 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.979
 We will have no problem 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:08.039
 now the samples remain we are adjusting 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:10.289
 with the toothpick love a little bit for 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.000
 that the ball does not move 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:15.340
 you see 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:18.700
 and we are putting 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:21.489
 [Music] 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:23.540
 we work this figure we work with 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:26.200
 a 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:29.970
 a butter cream with a midpoint 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:33.510
 maybe here it looks a bit more 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:36.090
 to soft light point because because with the 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:38.140
 heat from the spotlight camera have been 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.630
 cast a little more than the bill 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:41.120
 [Music] 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:45.339
 it has to be well defined 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.339
 [Music] 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.640
