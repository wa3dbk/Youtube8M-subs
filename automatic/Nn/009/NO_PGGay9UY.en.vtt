00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:08.940
 but 1 want to express my condolences from 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:10.860
 teams what happened happened 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:14.400
 now in our country 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:18.900
 heard yes this is the first why us grass 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:21.330
 these black bandages wanted to do 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:24.779
 a gift to people but football failed 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:30.390
 Such a thing does not always work on the game 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:35.910
 I can say that in the first half I think 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:38.940
 that the team was very good in terms of 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:43.219
 defense but probably attack in attack 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:45.739
 there were problems after missing the ball 

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:49.469
 for some reason, the team began to play football 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:52.980
 Well, you can see the shadow of Russo and rally which is 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:54.660
 what did i say break lost 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.350
 concentration on standard positions 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.620
 can not lose 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.270
 so no matter how I shouted with the shop 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:04.530
 probably too tired and lost 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:09.110
 concentration well I think all the same 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:12.360
 valencia looked fresher which plan 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:14.280
 thought plan why because the world 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:20.189
 we sat down when in the championship before something 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:23.580
 all the same different games than probably 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:27.290
 fees well and so generally I think that I have 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:29.369
 team blame don't be what the score is 02 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:32.220
 let's go to Valencia will fight 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.780
 what do you do 2 sometimes played a role like 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.070
 would we not like force majeure 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.490
 the circumstances of what is in our country 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:40.880
 happened as if I would not say were 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.079
 something 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:45.840
 justified would not justify all the same 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:48.840
 glad to have a neutral field and the army when it was 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.909
 across the stadium fill kiev 50001 others 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.630
 I probably emotions 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:54.409
 and psychological must look 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:58.579
 analyze 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:02:00.350
 where we have errors we analyze 

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:02.659
 and then already drowned on Valencia 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:05.319
 probably not over here there is still 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:08.660
 Ukraine Championship we have 2 hard ray 

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:11.349
 therefore, through the answer from Valencia we will 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:13.790
 probably already preparing for the championship and 

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:16.610
 maybe go valence who is it 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:19.519
 knows everything can be football 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:22.459
 Sometimes I think I should play 

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:24.890
 football and since it will come out later 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:27.530
 I also think it is impossible to leave the case 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:28.690
 but still such a nerve as a team 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:37.190
 left after all 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:41.829
 nerves going around judging Sasha not 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:45.829
 I'll be empty yet on the table but as you know 

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:47.989
 time takes its probably no back 

00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:51.470
 the surface there but ir tear is very 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:54.410
 seriously, well, why the doctors said 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:58.160
 until a diagnosis is not accurate and we do not 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:03:00.920
 but we can say sorry but I think that 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:06.340
 he came out of course a fine fish 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:06.340
 Juice did not yell well done praise 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:13.110
 but I risked our hacheridi stayyp 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:16.260
 there were problems with your knee as you know and 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:19.200
 the same garmash he did not appear 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:20.819
 liquid therefore war Masha Khacherid too 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:24.030
 have problems with your knee decided on 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:26.310
 such a rune a runny take a risk therefore in 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:28.020
 such a ray can happen all 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:33.510
 anything we can lose all man 

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:35.580
 for the remaining championship forecast first 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:38.100
 fees you probably already have not even received 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:40.470
 trauma and there and there and they played hard and mean and 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:44.730
 trovich but I think that they played 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:49.170
 ok we have that today 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:54.019
 thursday tomorrow is day off 22 we're going 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:54.019
 at the base and immediately with the base and fly to the collection 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:00.780
 all appearances 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:02.910
 not yet, but now negotiate 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:05.340
 probably no sense we are not just not 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:08.459
 We have time to clean tactical 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:10.320
 plan for richard work what we do not 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:12.660
 managed to analyze on faith 

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:14.489
 see why because if in 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:17.570
 defense in the first half was good 

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:20.519
 this and of course the most interesting 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:23.810
 I repeat that after a goal scored suddenly 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:29.160
 the team started playing football 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:31.380
 happens start a swarm sir oliver themes already 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:34.020
 accustomed then we have a plane breaks then 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:36.050
 force majeure some going to happen 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:37.970
 ready for everything I don't know what but 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:40.220
 Ukrainian championship, I believe that you can 

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:42.550
 calmly move given over there 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:45.560
 some terms 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:48.319
 uefa makes that decision just for 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:51.650
 It is of course inconvenient for us, I think something 

00:04:48.319 --> 00:04:56.389
 all the same we are home players throw as if 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:59.259
 she is not an athos for my husband I donâ€™t know me yet 

00:04:56.389 --> 00:04:59.259
 did not discuss this topic
