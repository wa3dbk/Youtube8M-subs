00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
getting to know each other then the

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.150 
getting to know each other then the
biggest<00:00:09.570> thing<00:00:09.780> is<00:00:09.900> continue<00:00:10.800> to<00:00:10.889> gain<00:00:11.130> our

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
biggest thing is continue to gain our

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:12.650 
biggest thing is continue to gain our
relationship<00:00:11.759> with<00:00:11.880> the<00:00:11.969> culture<00:00:12.179> stuff<00:00:12.540> I

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
relationship with the culture stuff I

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:13.940 
relationship with the culture stuff I
think<00:00:12.870> that's<00:00:13.049> the<00:00:13.139> biggest<00:00:13.349> thing<00:00:13.530> you<00:00:13.799> know

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
think that's the biggest thing you know

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:15.890 
think that's the biggest thing you know
when<00:00:14.580> you<00:00:14.790> trust<00:00:15.299> someone<00:00:15.480> and<00:00:15.630> you<00:00:15.870> have

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
when you trust someone and you have

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.330 
when you trust someone and you have
respect<00:00:16.440> for<00:00:16.590> someone<00:00:16.710> you<00:00:16.980> want<00:00:17.130> to<00:00:17.190> play

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
respect for someone you want to play

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:18.590 
respect for someone you want to play
even<00:00:17.400> harder<00:00:17.580> for<00:00:17.820> them<00:00:18.029> so<00:00:18.240> I<00:00:18.300> think<00:00:18.390> that's

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
even harder for them so I think that's

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.029 
even harder for them so I think that's
the<00:00:18.750> biggest<00:00:18.990> thing<00:00:19.109> I'm<00:00:19.470> just<00:00:19.500> better
