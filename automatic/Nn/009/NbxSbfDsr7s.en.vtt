the mag and I'm just going to try to

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.719 
the mag and I'm just going to try to
adjust<00:01:09.540> these<00:01:09.900> things<00:01:10.140> a<00:01:10.290> little<00:01:10.380> better<00:01:10.729> and

adjust these things a little better and

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.530 
adjust these things a little better and
go<00:01:11.880> with<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.150> same<00:01:12.390> load<00:01:12.689> that<00:01:14.119> is<00:01:15.119> written<00:01:15.420> on

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
go with the same load that is written on

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.510 
go with the same load that is written on
the<00:01:15.659> case<00:01:15.869> here<00:01:16.170> at<00:01:16.320> dice<00:01:16.590> from<00:01:16.979> 1986<00:01:18.799> so<00:01:19.799> we

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
the case here at dice from 1986 so we

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.670 
the case here at dice from 1986 so we
use<00:01:20.640> that<00:01:20.670> recipe<00:01:21.110> seat<00:01:22.110> the<00:01:22.259> bullet<00:01:22.530> just

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
use that recipe seat the bullet just

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.710 
use that recipe seat the bullet just
enough<00:01:23.040> to<00:01:23.189> get<00:01:23.310> it<00:01:23.460> feeding<00:01:23.670> and<00:01:24.030> take<00:01:24.450> it<00:01:24.600> out

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
enough to get it feeding and take it out

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.480 
enough to get it feeding and take it out
to<00:01:25.080> the<00:01:25.170> range<00:01:25.320> and<00:01:25.560> see<00:01:25.650> what<00:01:25.950> happens<00:01:26.280> and

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
to the range and see what happens and

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.640 
to the range and see what happens and
then<00:01:27.150> might<00:01:27.900> even<00:01:28.140> try

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
then might even try

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:33.020 
then might even try
I<00:01:30.799> even<00:01:31.799> tried<00:01:32.009> making<00:01:32.460> something<00:01:32.759> with<00:01:32.909> some

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
I even tried making something with some

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.590 
I even tried making something with some
of<00:01:33.150> this<00:01:33.240> stuff<00:01:33.390> but<00:01:33.860> the<00:01:34.860> real<00:01:35.040> ones<00:01:35.600> dropped

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
of this stuff but the real ones dropped

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.580 
of this stuff but the real ones dropped
it<00:01:36.810> will<00:01:37.229> make<00:01:37.380> with<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:38.060> IMR<00:01:39.060> 44<00:01:39.630> it's<00:01:39.780> 43<00:01:40.200> 20

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
it will make with the IMR 44 it's 43 20

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.880 
it will make with the IMR 44 it's 43 20
so<00:01:40.920> I<00:01:41.450> already<00:01:42.450> sized<00:01:42.659> all<00:01:42.960> my<00:01:43.079> cases<00:01:43.560> in

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
so I already sized all my cases in

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.130 
so I already sized all my cases in
advance<00:01:44.460> just<00:01:44.670> to<00:01:45.030> get<00:01:45.390> that<00:01:45.509> step<00:01:45.810> out<00:01:45.990> of<00:01:46.020> the

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
advance just to get that step out of the

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.639 
advance just to get that step out of the
way<00:01:46.259> kind<00:01:46.560> of<00:01:46.649> single<00:01:47.009> staged<00:01:47.310> the<00:01:48.649> Hornady

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
way kind of single staged the Hornady

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.789 
way kind of single staged the Hornady
here<00:01:49.920> so<00:01:50.540> now<00:01:51.540> I<00:01:51.570> got<00:01:51.840> the<00:01:51.960> bullet<00:01:52.290> cedar<00:01:52.560> in

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
here so now I got the bullet cedar in

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:56.810 
here so now I got the bullet cedar in
there<00:01:53.689> we'll<00:01:54.689> just<00:01:54.720> try<00:01:55.170> to<00:01:55.200> keep<00:01:55.820> adjusting

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
there we'll just try to keep adjusting

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.620 
there we'll just try to keep adjusting
this<00:01:57.360> until<00:01:57.840> I<00:01:58.939> tell<00:01:59.939> me<00:02:00.060> around<00:02:00.360> actually

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
this until I tell me around actually

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:06.920 
this until I tell me around actually
feeds<00:02:02.149> properly<00:02:03.860> see<00:02:04.860> I'm<00:02:05.040> just<00:02:05.310> gonna<00:02:05.930> work

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
feeds properly see I'm just gonna work

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:14.260 
feeds properly see I'm just gonna work
it<00:02:07.110> down<00:02:07.320> a<00:02:07.380> little<00:02:07.619> bit<00:02:07.829> at<00:02:08.039> time

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:14.270 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:17.550 

that's<00:02:15.140> for<00:02:15.410> sure<00:02:15.620> I<00:02:16.010> think<00:02:16.430> we<00:02:16.550> might<00:02:16.760> have

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
that's for sure I think we might have

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.320 
that's for sure I think we might have
almost<00:02:18.560> done<00:02:18.770> it<00:02:18.890> on<00:02:18.980> the<00:02:19.069> first<00:02:19.370> shot<00:02:20.030> there

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 
almost done it on the first shot there

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:25.210 
almost done it on the first shot there
it<00:02:20.600> just<00:02:20.660> it<00:02:21.350> does<00:02:21.560> go<00:02:21.740> down<00:02:23.560> but<00:02:24.560> just<00:02:24.800> barely

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
it just it does go down but just barely

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.240 
it just it does go down but just barely
and<00:02:25.819> with<00:02:26.060> these<00:02:26.240> soft<00:02:26.510> points<00:02:26.990> and<00:02:27.470> this<00:02:28.040> one

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
and with these soft points and this one

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.460 
and with these soft points and this one
here<00:02:28.459> I<00:02:28.489> might<00:02:28.730> even<00:02:28.910> you<00:02:29.450> know<00:02:29.569> I've<00:02:30.110> been

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 
here I might even you know I've been

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:31.809 
here I might even you know I've been
using<00:02:30.680> this<00:02:30.830> dummy<00:02:31.040> around<00:02:31.310> for<00:02:31.430> a<00:02:31.489> little<00:02:31.670> bit

00:02:31.809 --> 00:02:31.819 
using this dummy around for a little bit

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:32.890 
using this dummy around for a little bit
so<00:02:31.970> it<00:02:32.030> might<00:02:32.150> have<00:02:32.270> rubbed<00:02:32.450> a<00:02:32.540> little<00:02:32.630> bit<00:02:32.750> of

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
so it might have rubbed a little bit of

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.930 
so it might have rubbed a little bit of
that<00:02:32.989> soft<00:02:33.260> point<00:02:33.500> off<00:02:33.650> already<00:02:33.890> so<00:02:34.190> I'm<00:02:34.730> not

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940 
that soft point off already so I'm not

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:36.520 
that soft point off already so I'm not
completely<00:02:35.390> convinced<00:02:35.930> with<00:02:36.110> that<00:02:36.290> I'm<00:02:36.410> going

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
completely convinced with that I'm going

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:38.500 
completely convinced with that I'm going
to<00:02:36.590> see<00:02:36.739> it<00:02:36.800> it<00:02:36.920> just<00:02:37.069> a<00:02:37.190> little<00:02:37.459> bit<00:02:37.850> further

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
to see it it just a little bit further

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.690 
to see it it just a little bit further
just<00:02:38.780> to<00:02:39.470> make<00:02:39.650> sure<00:02:39.800> that<00:02:40.010> everything<00:02:40.489> feeds

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
just to make sure that everything feeds

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.360 
just to make sure that everything feeds
reliably<00:02:41.330> and<00:02:42.080> give<00:02:42.860> it<00:02:42.950> a<00:02:43.010> little<00:02:43.130> room

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
reliably and give it a little room

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:45.970 
reliably and give it a little room
margin<00:02:44.060> for<00:02:44.209> error<00:02:44.480> if<00:02:44.750> you<00:02:44.900> will<00:02:45.080> but<00:02:45.560> I<00:02:45.800> think

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 
margin for error if you will but I think

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:47.440 
margin for error if you will but I think
that'll<00:02:46.430> do<00:02:46.550> it<00:02:46.730> and<00:02:46.880> then<00:02:47.000> we're<00:02:47.120> on<00:02:47.209> to<00:02:47.360> the

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
that'll do it and then we're on to the

00:02:47.450 --> 00:03:10.259 
that'll do it and then we're on to the
powder<00:03:08.410> yep

00:03:10.259 --> 00:03:10.269 
powder yep

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:14.290 
powder yep
I'm<00:03:11.269> feeling<00:03:11.690> that<00:03:12.670> for<00:03:13.670> surprise<00:03:14.060> should

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:14.300 
I'm feeling that for surprise should

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:15.940 
I'm feeling that for surprise should
make<00:03:14.450> sure<00:03:14.480> it<00:03:14.780> actually<00:03:15.110> feeds<00:03:15.320> into<00:03:15.560> the<00:03:15.769> gun

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:15.950 
make sure it actually feeds into the gun

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:33.040 
make sure it actually feeds into the gun
right

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:33.050 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:39.730 

at<00:03:34.050> work<00:03:37.490> just<00:03:38.490> take<00:03:38.670> the<00:03:38.790> needle<00:03:38.940> nose<00:03:39.210> and

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:39.740 
at work just take the needle nose and

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:43.400 
at work just take the needle nose and
really<00:03:40.740> lock<00:03:41.040> that<00:03:41.250> guy<00:03:41.490> in<00:03:41.700> I<00:03:42.200> should<00:03:43.200> never

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:43.410 
really lock that guy in I should never

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:47.960 
really lock that guy in I should never
have<00:03:43.560> to<00:03:43.680> touch<00:03:43.770> this<00:03:43.980> again<00:03:46.700> let's<00:03:47.700> measure

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
have to touch this again let's measure

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:54.770 
have to touch this again let's measure
out<00:03:48.150> some<00:03:48.450> powder

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:59.710 

a<00:03:55.610> little<00:03:56.610> bit<00:03:56.730> too<00:03:56.940> much<00:03:57.740> dough<00:03:58.740> for<00:03:58.980> just

00:03:59.710 --> 00:03:59.720 
a little bit too much dough for just

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:10.670 
a little bit too much dough for just
40.5<00:04:00.720> grains<00:04:01.530> of<00:04:01.860> powder<00:04:02.010> how<00:04:02.520> long<00:04:02.819> oh<00:04:09.680> that's

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 
40.5 grains of powder how long oh that's

00:04:10.680 --> 00:06:22.130 
40.5 grains of powder how long oh that's
it<00:04:11.300> got<00:04:12.300> it

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:22.140 

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:30.000 

so<00:06:23.140> you<00:06:23.230> can<00:06:23.410> see<00:06:24.900> it's<00:06:25.900> my<00:06:26.050> first<00:06:26.290> group<00:06:29.010> guess

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:30.010 
so you can see it's my first group guess

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:32.060 
so you can see it's my first group guess
with<00:06:30.190> it<00:06:30.370> on<00:06:30.520> within<00:06:30.970> almost<00:06:31.240> an<00:06:31.600> inch

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:32.070 
with it on within almost an inch

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:39.170 
with it on within almost an inch
these<00:06:33.070> are<00:06:33.250> inch<00:06:33.400> squares<00:06:33.760> so<00:06:34.420> first<00:06:35.260> three<00:06:36.690> I

00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:39.180 
these are inch squares so first three I

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:44.210 
these are inch squares so first three I
think<00:06:40.180> this<00:06:40.390> was<00:06:40.600> second<00:06:41.530> three<00:06:41.800> right<00:06:42.040> here

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:44.220 
think this was second three right here

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:51.240 
think this was second three right here
two<00:06:45.220> three<00:06:47.430> maybe<00:06:48.430> I<00:06:48.580> did<00:06:48.730> five<00:06:48.970> minutes<00:06:50.250> yeah

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:51.250 
two three maybe I did five minutes yeah

00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:52.680 
two three maybe I did five minutes yeah
I<00:06:51.490> think<00:06:51.640> those<00:06:51.850> are<00:06:51.970> the<00:06:52.000> last<00:06:52.180> two<00:06:52.390> out<00:06:52.600> of

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:52.690 
I think those are the last two out of

00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:55.110 
I think those are the last two out of
there<00:06:52.810> and<00:06:52.930> I<00:06:53.020> started<00:06:53.520> recognize<00:06:54.520> a<00:06:54.550> bit<00:06:54.880> I

00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:55.120 
there and I started recognize a bit I

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:57.690 
there and I started recognize a bit I
just<00:06:56.050> pinched<00:06:56.590> the<00:06:56.680> crap<00:06:57.010> out<00:06:57.190> of<00:06:57.220> it

00:06:57.690 --> 00:06:57.700 
just pinched the crap out of it

00:06:57.700 --> 00:07:01.310 
just pinched the crap out of it
we<00:06:58.300> shouldn't<00:06:58.660> shoulder<00:06:59.110> back<00:06:59.290> there<00:06:59.500> too

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:01.320 
we shouldn't shoulder back there too

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:04.320 
we shouldn't shoulder back there too
and<00:07:02.320> then<00:07:02.410> I<00:07:02.500> think<00:07:02.710> last<00:07:02.980> three<00:07:03.280> that's<00:07:04.150> my

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:04.330 
and then I think last three that's my

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:05.880 
and then I think last three that's my
why<00:07:04.510> this<00:07:04.570> group<00:07:04.930> and<00:07:05.230> that<00:07:05.320> was<00:07:05.410> probably<00:07:05.650> me

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:05.890 
why this group and that was probably me

00:07:05.890 --> 00:07:11.570 
why this group and that was probably me
lazy<00:07:06.750> last<00:07:07.750> group<00:07:08.020> right<00:07:08.260> there<00:07:10.290> there<00:07:11.290> you<00:07:11.320> go

00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:11.580 
lazy last group right there there you go

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:15.870 
lazy last group right there there you go
that's<00:07:12.580> probably<00:07:12.940> the<00:07:13.030> best<00:07:13.590> three<00:07:14.590> you<00:07:15.550> screw

00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:15.880 
that's probably the best three you screw

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:20.940 
that's probably the best three you screw
it<00:07:16.030> up<00:07:16.120> so<00:07:17.050> we'll<00:07:17.200> take<00:07:17.350> this<00:07:17.560> one<00:07:19.620> I<00:07:20.620> think<00:07:20.860> the

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:20.950 
it up so we'll take this one I think the

00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:22.680 
it up so we'll take this one I think the
round<00:07:21.190> is<00:07:21.400> where<00:07:21.910> it<00:07:22.030> needs<00:07:22.060> to<00:07:22.300> be<00:07:22.390> I<00:07:22.540> just

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:22.690 
round is where it needs to be I just

00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:25.260 
round is where it needs to be I just
need<00:07:23.050> to<00:07:23.310> come<00:07:24.310> back<00:07:24.490> out<00:07:24.640> and<00:07:24.820> practice<00:07:25.120> my

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:25.270 
need to come back out and practice my

00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:26.550 
need to come back out and practice my
actual<00:07:25.540> shooting<00:07:25.780> now<00:07:26.020> I'm<00:07:26.230> going<00:07:26.380> to<00:07:26.440> leave

00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:26.560 
actual shooting now I'm going to leave

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:29.550 
actual shooting now I'm going to leave
the<00:07:26.680> lip<00:07:26.830> of<00:07:26.950> the<00:07:27.010> round<00:07:27.250> alone
