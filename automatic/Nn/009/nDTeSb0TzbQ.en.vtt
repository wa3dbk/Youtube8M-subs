cable or charge the battery pack

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.130 
cable or charge the battery pack
directly<00:02:14.580> so<00:02:14.790> that's<00:02:14.970> six<00:02:15.239> cells<00:02:15.750> in<00:02:15.930> there

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
directly so that's six cells in there

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.009 
directly so that's six cells in there
that's<00:02:16.620> a<00:02:16.709> seven<00:02:16.980> point<00:02:17.160> two<00:02:17.220> full<00:02:17.550> volt<00:02:18.450> 800

00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:19.019 
that's a seven point two full volt 800

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:20.900 
that's a seven point two full volt 800

gonna want to do is take this at

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.449 
gonna want to do is take this at
receiving<00:03:00.570> antenna<00:03:00.930> right<00:03:01.109> here<00:03:01.440> and<00:03:01.620> plug

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
receiving antenna right here and plug

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:04.069 
receiving antenna right here and plug
the<00:03:02.609> straw<00:03:02.880> into<00:03:03.180> the<00:03:03.299> hole<00:03:03.420> down<00:03:03.660> there<00:03:03.870> so

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:04.079 
the straw into the hole down there so

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:06.229 
the straw into the hole down there so
that<00:03:04.230> it<00:03:04.320> stands<00:03:04.680> up<00:03:04.950> that<00:03:05.459> is<00:03:05.609> going<00:03:05.850> to<00:03:06.030> keep

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239 
that it stands up that is going to keep

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:08.449 
that it stands up that is going to keep
it<00:03:06.450> from<00:03:06.660> getting<00:03:06.810> in<00:03:07.079> the<00:03:07.170> way<00:03:07.380> of<00:03:07.709> the<00:03:08.220> ladder

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459 
it from getting in the way of the ladder

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:11.330 
it from getting in the way of the ladder
which<00:03:09.180> is<00:03:09.780> pretty<00:03:10.170> much<00:03:10.320> the<00:03:10.560> coolest<00:03:10.739> ladder

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
which is pretty much the coolest ladder

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.530 
which is pretty much the coolest ladder
I've<00:03:11.609> ever<00:03:11.850> seen<00:03:12.150> because<00:03:12.390> it<00:03:13.040> extends<00:03:14.040> and

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540 
I've ever seen because it extends and

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:18.590 
I've ever seen because it extends and
lifts<00:03:15.540> and<00:03:15.920> rotates<00:03:16.920> yes<00:03:17.700> it<00:03:17.940> has<00:03:18.090> all<00:03:18.329> of<00:03:18.359> the

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:18.600 
lifts and rotates yes it has all of the

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:22.580 
lifts and rotates yes it has all of the
functionality<00:03:19.170> of<00:03:19.640> a<00:03:20.640> fire<00:03:21.239> engine<00:03:21.510> ladder<00:03:21.930> so

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
functionality of a fire engine ladder so

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:25.670 
functionality of a fire engine ladder so
that<00:03:22.620> is<00:03:22.920> to<00:03:23.100> say<00:03:23.280> it<00:03:23.489> comes<00:03:23.730> up<00:03:23.910> this<00:03:24.090> way<00:03:24.680> it

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
that is to say it comes up this way it

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:26.990 
that is to say it comes up this way it
extends<00:03:26.190> out<00:03:26.310> this<00:03:26.549> way

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
extends out this way

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.290 
extends out this way
and<00:03:27.230> it<00:03:28.230> rotates<00:03:28.440> around<00:03:29.040> this<00:03:29.220> way<00:03:29.430> okay<00:03:29.849> now

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:30.300 
and it rotates around this way okay now

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:32.570 
and it rotates around this way okay now
this<00:03:30.480> fire<00:03:30.750> nozzle<00:03:31.260> our<00:03:31.620> fire<00:03:31.950> nozzle<00:03:32.370> water

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:32.580 
this fire nozzle our fire nozzle water

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:33.360 
this fire nozzle our fire nozzle water
nozzle

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:33.370 
nozzle

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:34.830 
nozzle
at<00:03:33.549> the<00:03:33.670> end<00:03:33.819> remember<00:03:34.450> you<00:03:34.540> don't<00:03:34.629> have<00:03:34.720> to

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840 
at the end remember you don't have to

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:39.869 
at the end remember you don't have to
get<00:03:34.989> that<00:03:35.140> close<00:03:36.360> here<00:03:37.360> at<00:03:37.510> the<00:03:37.659> end<00:03:38.879> actually

00:03:39.869 --> 00:03:39.879 
get that close here at the end actually

00:03:39.879 --> 00:03:41.610 
get that close here at the end actually
sprays<00:03:40.480> water<00:03:40.720> so<00:03:41.019> there's<00:03:41.200> a<00:03:41.260> reservoir

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:41.620 
sprays water so there's a reservoir

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:43.020 
sprays water so there's a reservoir
right<00:03:41.950> here<00:03:42.159> that<00:03:42.310> we<00:03:42.370> can<00:03:42.519> fill<00:03:42.700> with<00:03:42.849> water

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.030 
right here that we can fill with water

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:45.780 
right here that we can fill with water
and<00:03:43.379> let's<00:03:44.379> have<00:03:44.590> here<00:03:45.190> we'll<00:03:45.370> do<00:03:45.459> a<00:03:45.489> quick

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:48.040 
sort of overview of the fire engine

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:49.800 
sort of overview of the fire engine
itself<00:03:48.370> so<00:03:48.670> yeah<00:03:48.849> I'm<00:03:48.970> gonna<00:03:49.090> lift<00:03:49.299> this<00:03:49.450> up<00:03:49.659> so
