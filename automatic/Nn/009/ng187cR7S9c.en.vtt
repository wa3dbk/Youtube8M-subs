00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:25.990
 what is it what is what 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:50.200
 that always comes in between 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.230
 What 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:56.050
 the world is something copied without 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:58.239
 between 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:01.239
 Clear is what it is still 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:04.059
 Church tent in purchase around today with carola 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:07.290
 and eberhard rink and the rings 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:07.290
 Of course, always something going on 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:13.690
 So you really want something right now 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:16.330
 do something completely different and zack rings 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:17.790
 The door somebody bothers you before what 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:24.130
 actually had a plan and 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:26.280
 therefore, what is what is and what it was 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:28.899
 so much going on 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.810
 I had a gas leak today that's enough 

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:34.240
 my church is already in the tent 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:37.170
 go and very difficult because normal 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:42.539
 Madness a year maybe not 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:45.729
 It is clear how much too simple maybe 

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:50.330
 maybe just maybe 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:52.580
 very quietly must decide 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:57.300
 dries 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:02:00.960
 I'll take a no a clear yes and no 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:02.910
 is the one thing in your own 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.310
 Music taste is the choice 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:07.459
 but longer 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:10.890
 I like almost everything except stylistically 

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:14.459
 Maybe I'm not like that anymore 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:16.110
 generation so i totally like chanson 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:17.220
 i just do not like it too 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.980
 can play a bit of theater 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.480
 while I sing I like to do so 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.470
 Feel pure in different situations 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.470
 or roll 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.440
 sensuality 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:38.709
 I wish I was what I was 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:38.709
 wanted 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:49.069
 yes was very amusing and yes even a 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:49.489
 a little fun and profound 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:53.569
 low 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:03:01.120
 I am very entertaining, we have fun 

00:02:53.569 --> 00:03:04.930
 what has been whatever 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.930
 it was a nice evening 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:13.090
 After all , something is always something 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:13.090
 always in between 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:17.290
 it was
