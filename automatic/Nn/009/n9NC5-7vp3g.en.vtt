00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.590
 rebels don't have flags they don't have 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.300
 leaders respond to themselves 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.640
 farmers breeders workers

 artisan student transporters 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.410
 unemployed entrepreneurs are not 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.150
 not aligned with a union

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.850
 do not recognize institutional referents 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:35.730
 we want to give you the shoulder 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.860
 this political class we want that 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:41.460
 they all resign we want to have the 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:43.950
 possibility to rewrite the country where 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.930
 we live in Veneto in first movements 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.090
 they start at night then from dawn i 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.940
 protesters position themselves in the joints 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:53.190
 neuralgic the tollgates of vicenza west of 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.199

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:00.030
 of fuel in the minds delays the 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.910
 truckers remain stuck in the queue 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:05.610

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:08.100
 almost two and a half hours to do this 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:11.220
 g section of the road here I ask a 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.140
 what the principals didn't have to do 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.700
 they had to do the principals 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.890
 I wonder why the police have 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.470
 allowed to do the principals because 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.210
 there had to be the art the arrest is 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.100

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.159

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:22.480
 citizens to say enough to this 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:24.340
