one of those games where you start to

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.540 
one of those games where you start to
wonder<00:03:09.840> hey<00:03:10.320> maybe<00:03:10.650> this<00:03:10.830> team<00:03:11.100> could<00:03:11.400> have

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:11.550 
wonder hey maybe this team could have

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:13.490 
wonder hey maybe this team could have

given the 92 dream team a run for their
money<00:03:13.560> you<00:03:14.250> talk<00:03:14.459> about<00:03:14.489> that<00:03:14.700> kind<00:03:15.000> of

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
money you talk about that kind of

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:16.880 
money you talk about that kind of
efficiency<00:03:15.690> from<00:03:15.900> outside<00:03:16.260> that<00:03:16.500> kind<00:03:16.769> of

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
efficiency from outside that kind of

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:18.530 
efficiency from outside that kind of
shooting<00:03:17.310> you<00:03:17.730> know<00:03:17.820> maybe<00:03:17.970> they<00:03:18.180> don't<00:03:18.360> win<00:03:18.510> a

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
shooting you know maybe they don't win a

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.539 
shooting you know maybe they don't win a
seven-game<00:03:19.050> series<00:03:19.260> like<00:03:19.560> Kobe<00:03:19.860> Bryant<00:03:20.310> said

00:03:20.539 --> 00:03:20.549 
seven-game series like Kobe Bryant said

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:22.460 
seven-game series like Kobe Bryant said
but<00:03:20.730> if<00:03:20.850> you<00:03:20.940> play<00:03:21.150> like<00:03:21.360> this<00:03:21.570> I<00:03:21.840> mean<00:03:22.350> not

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
but if you play like this I mean not

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:24.170 
but if you play like this I mean not
anyone<00:03:22.799> else<00:03:22.950> is<00:03:23.040> going<00:03:23.190> to<00:03:23.220> shoot<00:03:23.430> 71<00:03:23.880> percent

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
anyone else is going to shoot 71 percent

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:25.729 
anyone else is going to shoot 71 percent
from<00:03:24.269> the<00:03:24.390> field<00:03:24.630> and<00:03:24.780> hit<00:03:24.900> almost<00:03:25.260> thirty

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:25.739 
from the field and hit almost thirty

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:27.170 
from the field and hit almost thirty
three<00:03:26.010> pointers<00:03:26.400> in<00:03:26.519> the<00:03:26.580> game<00:03:26.790> it<00:03:26.940> doesn't

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
three pointers in the game it doesn't

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:28.460 
three pointers in the game it doesn't
happen<00:03:27.269> every<00:03:27.630> night<00:03:27.810> even<00:03:27.840> if<00:03:28.200> you've<00:03:28.290> got

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
happen every night even if you've got

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:29.900 
happen every night even if you've got
Michael<00:03:28.799> Jordan<00:03:29.130> and<00:03:29.250> everybody<00:03:29.580> else<00:03:29.760> on

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
Michael Jordan and everybody else on

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:32.000 
Michael Jordan and everybody else on
your<00:03:30.000> team<00:03:30.060> so<00:03:30.810> a<00:03:31.110> little<00:03:31.320> bit<00:03:31.530> of<00:03:31.560> food<00:03:31.830> for

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
your team so a little bit of food for

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:34.070 
your team so a little bit of food for
the<00:03:32.100> fodder<00:03:32.310> there<00:03:32.610> I<00:03:32.640> think<00:03:32.760> but<00:03:33.080> ultimately

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:34.080 
the fodder there I think but ultimately

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.199 
the fodder there I think but ultimately
the<00:03:34.350> takeaway<00:03:34.769> here<00:03:34.799> is<00:03:35.100> it<00:03:35.549> only<00:03:35.880> gets

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209 
the takeaway here is it only gets

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:38.300 
the takeaway here is it only gets
tougher<00:03:36.390> for<00:03:36.690> United<00:03:37.019> States<00:03:37.350> they<00:03:37.920> laid<00:03:38.160> the

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
tougher for United States they laid the

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:40.039 
tougher for United States they laid the
SmackDown<00:03:38.880> and<00:03:39.209> now<00:03:39.330> they<00:03:39.450> got<00:03:39.600> to<00:03:39.720> go<00:03:39.810> to<00:03:39.870> work

00:03:40.039 --> 00:03:40.049 
SmackDown and now they got to go to work

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:42.199
