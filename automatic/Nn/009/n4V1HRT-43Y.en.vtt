really want to see how this how this

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.200 
really want to see how this how this
game<00:00:23.369> would<00:00:24.060> do<00:00:24.830> against<00:00:25.830> my<00:00:26.039> very<00:00:26.099> very<00:00:26.609> very

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
game would do against my very very very

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.700 
game would do against my very very very
very<00:00:27.390> very<00:00:27.980> low<00:00:28.980> quality<00:00:29.660> PC<00:00:30.660> specs<00:00:30.929> or<00:00:31.380> not

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
very very low quality PC specs or not

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.160 
very very low quality PC specs or not
we're<00:00:31.859> not<00:00:32.189> necessarily<00:00:32.309> low<00:00:32.910> quality<00:00:33.180> but

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
we're not necessarily low quality but

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.100 
we're not necessarily low quality but
incredibly<00:00:35.130> cheap<00:00:35.520> when<00:00:36.329> I<00:00:36.360> built<00:00:36.630> this

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
incredibly cheap when I built this

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.380 
incredibly cheap when I built this
it<00:00:37.200> was<00:00:37.469> sub<00:00:38.450> $300<00:00:40.370> yeah<00:00:41.370> that<00:00:41.579> was<00:00:41.730> it<00:00:42.000> was<00:00:42.149> sub

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
it was exactly $290 actually if I'm like

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.529 
it was exactly $290 actually if I'm like
that<00:00:45.989> and<00:00:46.559> I<00:00:46.620> was<00:00:46.710> just<00:00:46.890> like<00:00:47.129> I<00:00:47.399> can<00:00:48.030> do<00:00:48.329> this

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
that and I was just like I can do this

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.560 
that and I was just like I can do this
it<00:00:49.140> can<00:00:49.289> do<00:00:49.440> this<00:00:49.559> I<00:00:49.710> can<00:00:49.829> play<00:00:49.980> titanfall<00:00:50.309> I

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:50.570 
it can do this I can play titanfall I

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:53.689 
it can do this I can play titanfall I
guarantee<00:00:51.570> it<00:00:51.690> and<00:00:51.930> as<00:00:52.890> you<00:00:53.010> can<00:00:53.100> see<00:00:53.160> this<00:00:53.489> is

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
guarantee it and as you can see this is

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.380 
guarantee it and as you can see this is
recorded<00:00:54.480> straight<00:00:54.930> from<00:00:55.320> the<00:00:56.219> tree<00:00:57.059> from<00:00:57.300> my

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
recorded straight from the tree from my

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.529 
recorded straight from the tree from my
PC<00:00:57.750> while<00:00:57.989> I'm<00:00:58.170> playing<00:00:58.609> so<00:00:59.609> there<00:00:59.879> was<00:01:00.059> a<00:01:00.270> lot

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
PC while I'm playing so there was a lot

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.450 
PC while I'm playing so there was a lot
of<00:01:00.570> there's<00:01:01.109> obviously<00:01:01.590> some<00:01:01.829> dropped<00:01:02.100> frames

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
of there's obviously some dropped frames

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.490 
of there's obviously some dropped frames
when<00:01:03.210> you're<00:01:03.390> recording<00:01:03.809> and<00:01:04.080> playing<00:01:04.320> at<00:01:04.470> the

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
when you're recording and playing at the

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.929 
when you're recording and playing at the
same<00:01:04.739> time<00:01:05.270> so<00:01:06.470> overall<00:01:07.470> I'd<00:01:08.010> say<00:01:08.040> I'm<00:01:08.580> pretty

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
same time so overall I'd say I'm pretty

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.539 
same time so overall I'd say I'm pretty
I'm<00:01:09.720> pretty<00:01:09.780> satisfied<00:01:10.710> with<00:01:10.740> what<00:01:11.340> I'm

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
I'm pretty satisfied with what I'm

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.940 
I'm pretty satisfied with what I'm
seeing<00:01:11.880> this<00:01:12.030> is<00:01:12.150> obviously<00:01:12.540> on<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:13.049> lowest

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
seeing this is obviously on the lowest

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.660 
seeing this is obviously on the lowest
of<00:01:14.159> all<00:01:14.340> the<00:01:14.520> settings<00:01:14.880> at<00:01:15.750> 720p<00:01:16.500> but<00:01:17.280> that

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
of all the settings at 720p but that

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.719

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
all settings sub $300 like those are

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.090 
all settings sub $300 like those are

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
the plan is to upgrade the grant or get

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.240 
the plan is to upgrade the grant or get
a<00:01:36.240> graphics<00:01:36.750> card<00:01:36.810> actually<00:01:37.350> because<00:01:37.560> in<00:01:37.799> this

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
a graphics card actually because in this

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.380 
a graphics card actually because in this
this<00:01:38.490> is<00:01:38.670> a<00:01:39.320> apu<00:01:40.350> or<00:01:40.619> a<00:01:40.680> CPU<00:01:41.579> and<00:01:41.700> a<00:01:41.790> GPU<00:01:41.820> put

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
this is a apu or a CPU and a GPU put

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.350 
this is a apu or a CPU and a GPU put
into<00:01:42.600> one<00:01:42.920> so<00:01:43.920> that<00:01:43.950> it<00:01:44.490> saves<00:01:44.820> a<00:01:44.939> lot<00:01:44.970> of<00:01:45.119> money

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
into one so that it saves a lot of money

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.560 
into one so that it saves a lot of money
and<00:01:45.540> it<00:01:45.659> did<00:01:45.840> the<00:01:46.380> the<00:01:46.950> cpu<00:01:47.430> GPU<00:01:47.460> combo<00:01:48.240> which

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
and it did the the cpu GPU combo which

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.170 
and it did the the cpu GPU combo which
is<00:01:48.720> just<00:01:48.930> a<00:01:48.990> cpu<00:01:49.409> no<00:01:49.590> GPU<00:01:50.009> um<00:01:50.430> cost<00:01:50.790> only<00:01:50.939> cost

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
is just a cpu no GPU um cost only cost

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.230 
is just a cpu no GPU um cost only cost
me<00:01:51.299> $100<00:01:51.899> um<00:01:52.159> plus<00:01:53.159> the<00:01:53.340> motherboard<00:01:53.790> was

me $100 um plus the motherboard was

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.990 
me $100 um plus the motherboard was
technically<00:01:55.020> free<00:01:55.380> or<00:01:55.649> it<00:01:56.399> was<00:01:56.579> quote-unquote

was only a hundred fourteen dollars when
I<00:02:07.560> built<00:02:07.770> this<00:02:07.920> and<00:02:08.369> I<00:02:08.429> was<00:02:08.550> like<00:02:08.580> hmm<00:02:09.209> this<00:02:09.720> is

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929

this is this is off the chip this is

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:13.520 
this is this is off the chip this is

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
graphics card and not even worried about

graphics card and not even worried about
having<00:02:53.940> an<00:02:54.030> APU<00:02:54.300> but<00:02:55.140> since<00:02:55.350> I<00:02:55.470> didn't<00:02:55.830> this<00:02:56.070> is

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
having an APU but since I didn't this is

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.550 
having an APU but since I didn't this is
what<00:02:56.370> I<00:02:56.400> had<00:02:56.550> to<00:02:56.580> go<00:02:56.760> with<00:02:56.970> so<00:02:57.560> technically

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
what I had to go with so technically

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.410 
what I had to go with so technically
speaking<00:02:58.920> if<00:02:59.130> you<00:02:59.250> have<00:02:59.489> around<00:02:59.790> $400<00:03:00.360> you

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
speaking if you have around $400 you

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:01.820 
speaking if you have around $400 you
should<00:03:00.569> definitely<00:03:01.110> be<00:03:01.260> able<00:03:01.350> to<00:03:01.530> run<00:03:01.680> this

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
should definitely be able to run this

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:03.979 
should definitely be able to run this
game<00:03:02.040> at<00:03:02.340> around<00:03:02.610> 60<00:03:02.880> frames<00:03:03.060> a<00:03:03.180> second<00:03:03.510> with<00:03:03.959> a

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
dedicated graphics card which I'm going

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.870 
dedicated graphics card which I'm going
to<00:03:05.790> get<00:03:06.060> one<00:03:06.560> hopefully<00:03:07.560> very<00:03:07.860> very<00:03:08.010> soon<00:03:08.280> like

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
to get one hopefully very very soon like

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.930 
to get one hopefully very very soon like
incredibly<00:03:09.780> soon<00:03:10.050> and<00:03:10.350> then<00:03:10.860> then<00:03:11.610> I'll<00:03:11.760> be

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
incredibly soon and then then I'll be

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:13.580 
incredibly soon and then then I'll be
perfectly<00:03:12.450> fine<00:03:12.660> as<00:03:12.959> you<00:03:13.050> can<00:03:13.170> see<00:03:13.290> the<00:03:13.410> game

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
perfectly fine as you can see the game

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:15.890 
perfectly fine as you can see the game
looks<00:03:13.860> very<00:03:14.160> bad<00:03:15.030> and<00:03:15.390> I'm<00:03:15.450> guessing<00:03:15.810> that's

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
looks very bad and I'm guessing that's

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.680 
looks very bad and I'm guessing that's
due<00:03:16.140> to<00:03:16.319> not<00:03:16.920> it's<00:03:17.489> obvious<00:03:17.730> titanfall<00:03:18.239> this

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
due to not it's obvious titanfall this

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:20.900 
due to not it's obvious titanfall this
is<00:03:18.810> the<00:03:18.959> open<00:03:19.230> beta<00:03:19.380> obviously<00:03:19.950> and<00:03:20.190> it's<00:03:20.700> not

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
is the open beta obviously and it's not

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:23.630 
is the open beta obviously and it's not
I'm<00:03:21.230> hoping<00:03:22.230> it's<00:03:22.380> not<00:03:22.440> as<00:03:22.739> optimized<00:03:23.280> as<00:03:23.489> it

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640 
I'm hoping it's not as optimized as it

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:24.920 
I'm hoping it's not as optimized as it
would<00:03:23.790> be<00:03:23.940> when<00:03:24.180> the<00:03:24.299> full<00:03:24.480> game<00:03:24.630> was<00:03:24.780> released

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
would be when the full game was released

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:27.500 
would be when the full game was released
in<00:03:25.260> about<00:03:25.920> a<00:03:25.950> month<00:03:26.370> this<00:03:26.579> should<00:03:26.880> be<00:03:27.060> just<00:03:27.329> a

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
in about a month this should be just a

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:30.050 
in about a month this should be just a
really<00:03:27.810> big<00:03:28.110> learning<00:03:28.500> experience<00:03:28.890> for<00:03:29.670> them

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
really big learning experience for them

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.080 
really big learning experience for them
I<00:03:30.230> hope<00:03:31.230> they're<00:03:31.500> getting<00:03:31.620> everybody's<00:03:32.340> um<00:03:32.579> PC

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
I hope they're getting everybody's um PC

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:35.960 
I hope they're getting everybody's um PC
specs<00:03:33.299> along<00:03:34.200> with<00:03:34.650> when<00:03:35.549> everybody's

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
specs along with when everybody's

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:37.430 
specs along with when everybody's
playing<00:03:36.180> so<00:03:36.420> they<00:03:36.600> can<00:03:36.750> optimize<00:03:37.140> a<00:03:37.170> little

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
playing so they can optimize a little

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.860 
playing so they can optimize a little
bit<00:03:37.560> better<00:03:37.820> for<00:03:38.820> other<00:03:39.000> systems<00:03:39.299> in<00:03:39.720> full

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
bit better for other systems in full

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:41.600 
bit better for other systems in full

Source engine is very very very
optimizable<00:04:07.320> so<00:04:07.859> what<00:04:07.950> I'm<00:04:08.010> trying<00:04:08.190> to<00:04:08.220> say

in terms of the lower friendly guys but

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:16.190 
in terms of the lower friendly guys but
this<00:04:13.980> is<00:04:14.040> a<00:04:14.130> hardcore<00:04:14.840> battle<00:04:15.840> right<00:04:15.930> here<00:04:16.049> you

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:16.200 
this is a hardcore battle right here you

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.500 
this is a hardcore battle right here you
can<00:04:16.350> see<00:04:16.470> I'm<00:04:16.560> dropping<00:04:16.950> a<00:04:17.100> lot<00:04:17.400> a<00:04:17.729> lot<00:04:18.209> of

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:18.510 
can see I'm dropping a lot a lot of

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:20.270 
can see I'm dropping a lot a lot of
frames<00:04:18.810> that<00:04:19.109> is<00:04:19.530> what<00:04:19.650> happens<00:04:19.919> when<00:04:19.979> you<00:04:20.070> see

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 
frames that is what happens when you see

get<00:04:20.430> into<00:04:20.640> a<00:04:20.669> really<00:04:20.910> big<00:04:21.150> battle<00:04:21.479> and<00:04:21.570> that's

get into a really big battle and that's

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:22.820 
get into a really big battle and that's
what<00:04:21.780> I'm<00:04:21.870> worried<00:04:22.049> about<00:04:22.109> that's<00:04:22.380> why<00:04:22.560> I<00:04:22.620> want

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:22.830 
what I'm worried about that's why I want

what I'm worried about that's why I want
to<00:04:22.919> get

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:24.070 
to get

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:25.530 
to get
dedicated<00:04:24.550> graphics<00:04:24.700> art<00:04:25.030> because<00:04:25.240> I<00:04:25.300> really

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:25.540 
dedicated graphics art because I really

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:26.940 
dedicated graphics art because I really
do<00:04:25.660> want<00:04:25.690> to<00:04:25.870> be<00:04:25.960> playing<00:04:26.140> this<00:04:26.290> game<00:04:26.440> a<00:04:26.500> lot<00:04:26.770> um

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:26.950 
do want to be playing this game a lot um

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:28.530 
do want to be playing this game a lot um
it's<00:04:27.280> supposed<00:04:27.730> to<00:04:27.850> be<00:04:27.940> my<00:04:28.090> called<00:04:28.390> D

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:28.540 
it's supposed to be my called D

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:31.020 
it's supposed to be my called D
replacement<00:04:29.140> and<00:04:29.350> by<00:04:30.310> the<00:04:30.370> looks<00:04:30.640> of<00:04:30.760> it<00:04:30.850> it

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:31.030 
replacement and by the looks of it it

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:32.700 
replacement and by the looks of it it
feels<00:04:31.480> what<00:04:31.660> I<00:04:31.690> call<00:04:31.870> a<00:04:31.900> duty<00:04:32.200> a<00:04:32.230> little<00:04:32.530> bit<00:04:32.680> uh

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:32.710 
feels what I call a duty a little bit uh

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:34.560 
feels what I call a duty a little bit uh
it's<00:04:33.220> a<00:04:33.310> little<00:04:33.580> bit<00:04:33.730> smoother<00:04:34.150> and<00:04:34.360> I<00:04:34.420> don't

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:34.570 
it's a little bit smoother and I don't

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:36.810 
it's a little bit smoother and I don't
know<00:04:34.630> if<00:04:34.780> it's<00:04:34.900> B<00:04:35.020> if<00:04:35.260> it's<00:04:35.440> because<00:04:35.590> I'm<00:04:36.220> on<00:04:36.370> PC

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:36.820 
know if it's B if it's because I'm on PC

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:39.210 
know if it's B if it's because I'm on PC
knows<00:04:37.000> of<00:04:37.210> console<00:04:37.630> but<00:04:37.720> it<00:04:37.810> does<00:04:38.020> seem<00:04:38.590> to<00:04:39.190> be

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:39.220 
knows of console but it does seem to be

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:40.860 
knows of console but it does seem to be
a<00:04:39.310> little<00:04:39.670> bit<00:04:39.880> smoother<00:04:40.360> I'm<00:04:40.600> actually

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:40.870 
a little bit smoother I'm actually

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:42.720 
a little bit smoother I'm actually
playing<00:04:41.170> with<00:04:41.230> the<00:04:41.320> controller<00:04:41.830> on<00:04:42.130> this<00:04:42.430> um

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:42.730 
playing with the controller on this um

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:46.290 
playing with the controller on this um
with<00:04:43.450> my<00:04:43.570> ps3<00:04:43.840> controller<00:04:44.350> on<00:04:44.650> this<00:04:45.220> video<00:04:45.490> or

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:46.300 
with my ps3 controller on this video or

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:48.600 
with my ps3 controller on this video or
on<00:04:46.360> this<00:04:46.630> gameplay<00:04:46.870> that<00:04:47.080> matters<00:04:47.890> because<00:04:48.370> it

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:48.610 
on this gameplay that matters because it

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:50.820 
on this gameplay that matters because it
just<00:04:49.000> feels<00:04:49.240> a<00:04:49.390> little<00:04:49.450> bit<00:04:49.630> better<00:04:49.900> and<00:04:50.170> like

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:50.830 
just feels a little bit better and like

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:52.230 
just feels a little bit better and like
I<00:04:50.920> said<00:04:51.100> I<00:04:51.130> don't<00:04:51.250> obviously<00:04:51.370> if<00:04:51.910> it's<00:04:52.090> because

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:52.240 
I said I don't obviously if it's because

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:53.790 
I said I don't obviously if it's because
I'm<00:04:52.450> on<00:04:52.510> PC<00:04:52.900> if<00:04:53.020> it's<00:04:53.200> just<00:04:53.560> because<00:04:53.770> it's

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:53.800 
I'm on PC if it's just because it's

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.350 
I'm on PC if it's just because it's
titanfall<00:04:54.250> I'm<00:04:54.580> hoping<00:04:54.850> it's<00:04:55.000> just<00:04:55.150> because

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:55.360 
titanfall I'm hoping it's just because

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:59.040 
titanfall I'm hoping it's just because
its<00:04:55.480> site<00:04:55.660> involved<00:04:56.020> but<00:04:56.620> it's<00:04:57.220> here<00:04:57.670> and<00:04:58.050> your

00:04:59.040 --> 00:04:59.050 
its site involved but it's here and your

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:01.770 
its site involved but it's here and your
PC<00:04:59.320> can<00:04:59.680> probably<00:05:00.150> do<00:05:01.150> a<00:05:01.180> little<00:05:01.300> something

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:01.780 
PC can probably do a little something

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:03.720 
PC can probably do a little something
and<00:05:01.930> the<00:05:02.590> next<00:05:02.620> thing<00:05:03.070> I'm<00:05:03.280> trying<00:05:03.520> to<00:05:03.580> figure

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:03.730 
and the next thing I'm trying to figure

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:06.930

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:06.940 
out is if if it's if it's not running

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:09.900 
out is if if it's if it's not running
well<00:05:07.210> or<00:05:07.600> not<00:05:07.900> up<00:05:08.230> to<00:05:08.440> par<00:05:08.650> aka<00:05:09.220> 60<00:05:09.640> frames<00:05:09.790> a

it's<00:05:13.450> the<00:05:13.540> CPU<00:05:14.110> or<00:05:14.140> the<00:05:14.320> GPU<00:05:14.680> if<00:05:14.770> it's<00:05:14.920> the<00:05:15.040> GPU

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:15.460 
it's the CPU or the GPU if it's the GPU

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:17.670 
it's the CPU or the GPU if it's the GPU
perfect<00:05:16.210> I<00:05:16.330> can<00:05:16.420> just<00:05:16.660> easily<00:05:16.900> get<00:05:17.260> an<00:05:17.320> uprated

that<00:05:24.190> is<00:05:24.430> for<00:05:24.730> GPUs<00:05:25.120> so<00:05:25.810> but<00:05:26.260> I'm<00:05:26.350> pretty<00:05:27.010> sure

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:27.250 
that is for GPUs so but I'm pretty sure

I'm banking on the fact that these are

all particle effects that is mostly

all particle effects that is mostly

and<00:05:32.980> that's<00:05:33.070> definitely<00:05:33.550> one<00:05:34.540> hundred

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:34.810 
and that's definitely one hundred

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:38.940 
and that's definitely one hundred
percent<00:05:34.960> GPU<00:05:35.740> side<00:05:35.980> stuff<00:05:37.020> so<00:05:38.020> titanfall<00:05:38.560> in

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:38.950 
percent GPU side stuff so titanfall in

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:42.300 
percent GPU side stuff so titanfall in
general<00:05:39.430> is<00:05:39.880> a<00:05:40.780> very<00:05:41.350> very<00:05:41.680> very<00:05:41.890> fun<00:05:42.280> game

general is a very very very fun game
very<00:05:42.970> fast-paced<00:05:43.570> but<00:05:44.200> the<00:05:44.560> game<00:05:44.800> modes<00:05:45.340> can

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:45.670 
very fast-paced but the game modes can

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:48.300 
very fast-paced but the game modes can
be<00:05:45.730> a<00:05:46.060> little<00:05:46.330> bit<00:05:46.450> long<00:05:46.690> compared<00:05:47.440> to<00:05:47.740> how

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:48.310 
be a little bit long compared to how

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:51.150 
be a little bit long compared to how
long<00:05:48.610> it<00:05:48.670> feels<00:05:49.120> like<00:05:49.420> that<00:05:50.110> you're<00:05:50.560> actually

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:51.160

definitely very very fun actually this
part<00:06:19.840> right<00:06:20.020> here<00:06:20.350> might<00:06:20.500> be<00:06:20.620> one<00:06:20.860> of<00:06:20.950> the

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:21.010 
part right here might be one of the

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:23.490 
part right here might be one of the
longer<00:06:21.370> parts<00:06:21.670> the<00:06:21.790> epilogue<00:06:22.180> after<00:06:23.050> you<00:06:23.230> win

from<00:06:28.750> the<00:06:28.810> battle<00:06:29.170> scene<00:06:29.320> so<00:06:29.470> this<00:06:29.620> might

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:29.770 
from the battle scene so this might

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:31.680 
from the battle scene so this might
actually<00:06:29.890> be<00:06:30.130> the<00:06:30.190> longest<00:06:30.550> part<00:06:30.820> but<00:06:31.480> in

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:31.690 
actually be the longest part but in

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:34.050 
actually be the longest part but in
