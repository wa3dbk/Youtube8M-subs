00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:34.590
 get rich and leave such a goal in front 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:36.660

 he is now another man millionaire 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:01.810
 he says the most amazing thought 

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:06.280
 for him is that until you 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:07.930
 left the race you would not lose if 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:10.330
 lincoln fizzled out 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:13.590
 some year his name seal would be to anyone 

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:16.810
 it was not known but he continued 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:19.360
 despite all their terrible defeats 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:22.750
 here's the story teaches us only one if 

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:25.210
 today you fail failure failures 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:29.770
 if you can't do it today 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:33.280
 tomorrow you are waiting for victory in the mandatory 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:37.870
 okay provided you don't give up 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:41.200
 if you continue the story teaches what 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:43.510
 failure success as a rule I have said 

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:45.490
 About Thomas Edison I already spoke about 

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:47.410
 Churchill and I tell you the program 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:51.970
 lincoln I can tell a lot 

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:54.880
 examples when a key success factor 

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:57.730
 is perseverance 

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:59.710
 don't give up don't give up under any 

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:00.900
 circumstances don't give up and you 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:08.380
 will win 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:10.680
 the story I know from the book the story is one 

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:14.040
 guy 

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:17.530
 suffered a defeat taking up this 

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:21.100
 business in one of the companies is unsuccessful he 

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:25.510
 the sponsor joined him cheated to say the least 

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:30.330
 did not teach here in short did not clarify and 

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:34.780
 Moreover, he also fell into debt and 

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:38.590
 he had to return to his father's house under 

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:40.330
 daddy's wing age of 26 again being 

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:42.490
 already on free bread by yourself 

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:43.580
 while living he was forced to return to 

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:48.259
 parental home 

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:50.870
 and there was nothing to eat and he went again 

00:05:48.259 --> 00:05:53.210
 his work he was an engineer and in the family 

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:58.280
 was an outcast mocked senior 

00:05:53.210 --> 00:06:01.400
 brothers and sisters and he worked as an engineer 

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:05.870
 trying to pay debts but once his 

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:08.389
 again some familiar fascinated by this 

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:10.639
 ideas get rich in network marketing and 

00:06:08.389 --> 00:06:12.199
 He did not look in advance which gave promise 

00:06:10.639 --> 00:06:13.550
 when not doing this again 

00:06:12.199 --> 00:06:16.129
 started because he didn't see the exit 

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:18.830
 other because he realized that in this 

00:06:16.129 --> 00:06:20.060
 see here as an opportunity and he is ours he 

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:22.430
 set a goal 

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:25.219
 he swore that he would succeed 

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:29.060
 prove to his father that he movies them that he 

00:06:25.219 --> 00:06:32.060
 the man that he can and he chose us 

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:34.550
 simple method one he took the reference book 

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:37.009
 phones and started calling him 

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:39.500
 worked from 8 am to 10 pm each 

00:06:37.009 --> 00:06:41.889
 day he equipped his office garage 

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:45.159
 countries at my father's house and started calling 

00:06:41.889 --> 00:06:49.520
 signed every 250 

00:06:45.159 --> 00:06:50.810
 every 200 50 year he kept then 

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:53.029
 gradually he had other 

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:56.029
 ways then other methods 

00:06:53.029 --> 00:06:58.629
 through with purple was for her he drew 

00:06:56.029 --> 00:07:03.529
 people behind him and he took his persistence 

00:06:58.629 --> 00:07:08.599
 each 250 subscribe 249 said 

00:07:03.529 --> 00:07:11.839
 went in but didn't give he didn't give up and you didn't 

00:07:08.599 --> 00:07:14.560
 never pass on to any authors like 

00:07:11.839 --> 00:07:20.539
 we will not give up and we will win 

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:22.490
 remember if one fails if not 

00:07:20.539 --> 00:07:23.360
 I argue using tedmed from you not 

00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:25.909

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:28.490
 can you find another if something is not 

00:07:25.909 --> 00:07:33.099
 working means that there is something that 

00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:35.569
 earn try try know there is a huge 

00:07:33.099 --> 00:07:36.100
 perspective on the internet we will 

00:07:35.569 --> 00:07:38.170
 her 

00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:41.040
 working this prospect and succeed 

00:07:38.170 --> 00:07:41.040
 forward
