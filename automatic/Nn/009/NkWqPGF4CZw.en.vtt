on the 1st string and you pick for free
1<00:03:03.770> again<00:03:05.770> then<00:03:06.770> d<00:03:06.950> 4th<00:03:07.510> so

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:11.240

and<00:03:56.140> the<00:03:57.140> next<00:03:57.410> part<00:03:57.680> is<00:03:57.890> extremely<00:03:58.490> easy

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:01.450 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:04.870 

it's<00:04:02.450> just<00:04:02.980> several<00:04:03.980> two-finger<00:04:04.610> coats

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:04.880 
it's just several two-finger coats

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:08.140 
it's just several two-finger coats
followed<00:04:05.630> by<00:04:05.810> each<00:04:05.960> other<00:04:06.760> first<00:04:07.760> one<00:04:08.000> like

third finger on the full string on the

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:46.559 
third finger on the full string on the

00:04:46.559 --> 00:04:46.569 

00:04:46.569 --> 00:04:50.469 

then<00:04:47.569> you<00:04:47.870> move<00:04:48.800> your<00:04:48.830> first<00:04:49.669> finger<00:04:50.150> to<00:04:50.180> the

00:04:55.809 --> 00:04:55.819 
third string so they just switch strings

00:04:55.819 --> 00:04:59.589 
third string so they just switch strings
