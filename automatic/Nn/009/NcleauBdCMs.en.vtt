00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.890 
check it out here to see how it looks
and<00:00:21.660> what<00:00:22.410> some<00:00:22.859> of<00:00:22.920> the<00:00:23.130> changes<00:00:23.430> are<00:00:23.970> I<00:00:24.240> think

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
and what some of the changes are I think

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.470 
and what some of the changes are I think
some<00:00:25.890> of<00:00:25.920> the<00:00:26.160> changes<00:00:26.369> are<00:00:26.789> background

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
some of the changes are background

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.950 
some of the changes are background
changes<00:00:28.170> like<00:00:28.529> there's<00:00:29.220> urban<00:00:30.210> fixes<00:00:30.720> when<00:00:30.869> it

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
changes like there's urban fixes when it

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.880 
changes like there's urban fixes when it
comes<00:00:31.230> to<00:00:31.650> memory<00:00:31.949> leakage<00:00:32.989> memory<00:00:33.989> sprawl<00:00:34.530> as

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
comes to memory leakage memory sprawl as

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.840 
comes to memory leakage memory sprawl as
well<00:00:35.100> as<00:00:35.250> battery<00:00:36.239> drain<00:00:36.540> in<00:00:36.930> standby<00:00:37.710> mode

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:37.850 
well as battery drain in standby mode

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.940 
well as battery drain in standby mode
but<00:00:38.850> there<00:00:39.000> are<00:00:39.120> some<00:00:39.450> new<00:00:40.290> features<00:00:40.559> as<00:00:40.920> well

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
but there are some new features as well

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.860 
but there are some new features as well
which<00:00:41.460> have<00:00:41.640> been<00:00:41.760> brought<00:00:42.030> on<00:00:42.059> switches<00:00:42.840> a

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
which have been brought on switches a

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:48.020 
which have been brought on switches a
dedicated<00:00:44.329> memory<00:00:45.410> manager<00:00:46.520> so<00:00:47.520> you<00:00:47.610> can<00:00:47.789> see

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
dedicated memory manager so you can see

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.319 
dedicated memory manager so you can see
this<00:00:48.239> here<00:00:48.920> which<00:00:49.920> is<00:00:50.250> probably<00:00:50.789> long<00:00:51.120> overdue

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
this here which is probably long overdue

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:56.500 
this here which is probably long overdue
really<00:00:52.230> I<00:00:52.440> can<00:00:53.280> see<00:00:53.550> that<00:00:53.760> we<00:00:53.940> can<00:00:53.969> control<00:00:54.960> the

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:56.510 
really I can see that we can control the

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:59.000 
really I can see that we can control the
performance<00:00:57.510> here<00:00:57.840> as<00:00:58.050> well<00:00:58.260> as<00:00:58.410> the<00:00:58.590> memory

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
performance here as well as the memory

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.840 
performance here as well as the memory
used<00:00:59.460> by<00:00:59.670> certain<00:01:00.239> apps<00:01:01.070> so<00:01:02.070> that<00:01:02.340> is<00:01:02.520> pretty

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
used by certain apps so that is pretty

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:08.149 
used by certain apps so that is pretty
cool<00:01:02.969> and<00:01:04.189> it<00:01:05.189> goes<00:01:05.430> by<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:06.710> strange<00:01:07.710> number

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
cool and it goes by the strange number

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.390 
cool and it goes by the strange number
or<00:01:09.150> numbering<00:01:09.960> system<00:01:10.530> that<00:01:10.770> google<00:01:10.979> has

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
or numbering system that google has

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.480 
or numbering system that google has
adopted<00:01:11.670> for<00:01:12.210> these<00:01:12.470> particular<00:01:13.490> releases

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
adopted for these particular releases

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.100 
adopted for these particular releases
this<00:01:14.729> is<00:01:14.909> the<00:01:15.060> MPS<00:01:15.570> at<00:01:15.840> 79<00:01:16.530> m<00:01:17.240> so<00:01:18.240> where<00:01:18.630> we<00:01:18.930> can

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
this is the MPS at 79 m so where we can

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.910 
this is the MPS at 79 m so where we can
see<00:01:19.380> the<00:01:19.710> new<00:01:20.310> android<00:01:21.259> symbol<00:01:22.259> here<00:01:22.590> which<00:01:22.770> is

see the new android symbol here which is

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.570 
see the new android symbol here which is
quite<00:01:23.189> nice<00:01:23.460> and<00:01:24.000> we<00:01:24.119> do<00:01:24.270> get<00:01:24.509> so<00:01:24.810> weird<00:01:25.580> kind

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
quite nice and we do get so weird kind

quite nice and we do get so weird kind
of<00:01:26.810> no<00:01:27.810> toast<00:01:28.170> notification<00:01:29.130> when<00:01:29.310> you<00:01:29.520> try<00:01:29.790> go

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
of no toast notification when you try go

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:33.289 
of no toast notification when you try go
into<00:01:30.119> a<00:01:30.150> game<00:01:31.310> other<00:01:32.310> than<00:01:32.490> that<00:01:32.549> obviously

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
into a game other than that obviously

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.380 
into a game other than that obviously
you<00:01:33.720> will<00:01:33.930> have<00:01:34.110> seen<00:01:34.380> this<00:01:34.740> new<00:01:35.280> kind<00:01:35.610> of<00:01:35.820> app

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
you will have seen this new kind of app

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.620 
you will have seen this new kind of app
drawer<00:01:36.810> for<00:01:37.229> the<00:01:37.470> original<00:01:38.630> developer

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
drawer for the original developer

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.510 
drawer for the original developer
preview<00:01:39.930> so<00:01:41.060> think<00:01:42.060> that<00:01:42.630> is<00:01:43.100> quite<00:01:44.100> the<00:01:44.159> same

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
preview so think that is quite the same

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.889 
preview so think that is quite the same
here<00:01:45.409> everything<00:01:46.409> seems<00:01:46.740> to<00:01:46.890> be<00:01:47.880> quite<00:01:48.180> a<00:01:48.360> nice

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
here everything seems to be quite a nice

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.840 
here everything seems to be quite a nice
and<00:01:49.170> fast<00:01:49.409> actually<00:01:49.680> I<00:01:49.950> was<00:01:50.070> expecting<00:01:50.460> it<00:01:50.790> to

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
and fast actually I was expecting it to

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.280 
and fast actually I was expecting it to
be<00:01:51.060> a<00:01:51.990> little<00:01:52.290> bit<00:01:52.560> kind<00:01:53.430> of<00:01:53.549> boogie<00:01:54.229> kind<00:01:55.229> of

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
be a little bit kind of boogie kind of

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.030 
be a little bit kind of boogie kind of
like<00:01:55.439> the<00:01:55.770> iOS<00:01:56.340> beaches<00:01:57.000> but<00:01:57.530> to<00:01:58.530> me<00:01:58.680> just

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
like the iOS beaches but to me just

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.139 
like the iOS beaches but to me just
seems<00:01:59.250> very<00:01:59.909> nice<00:02:00.240> and<00:02:00.469> usable<00:02:01.469> here<00:02:01.829> a<00:02:01.979> bit<00:02:02.729> of

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
seems very nice and usable here a bit of

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.929 
seems very nice and usable here a bit of
a<00:02:03.329> shame<00:02:03.600> that<00:02:03.630> we<00:02:03.960> don't<00:02:04.140> have<00:02:04.469> a<00:02:04.799> fast<00:02:05.670> way<00:02:05.909> to

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
a shame that we don't have a fast way to

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:08.330 
a shame that we don't have a fast way to
get<00:02:06.390> rid<00:02:06.600> of<00:02:06.630> all<00:02:06.990> these<00:02:07.409> things<00:02:07.799> I<00:02:07.950> think<00:02:08.190> that

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
get rid of all these things I think that

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:09.090 
get rid of all these things I think that
is

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:09.100 
is

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:12.240 
is
quite<00:02:09.730> annoying<00:02:10.440> still<00:02:11.440> that<00:02:11.680> I<00:02:11.740> have<00:02:11.890> to<00:02:12.070> do

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
quite annoying still that I have to do

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.650 
quite annoying still that I have to do
this<00:02:12.460> one<00:02:13.360> by<00:02:13.390> one<00:02:14.340> but<00:02:15.340> other<00:02:15.550> than<00:02:15.670> that<00:02:15.730> you

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
this one by one but other than that you

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:18.660 
this one by one but other than that you
can<00:02:16.930> see<00:02:17.200> we<00:02:17.320> do<00:02:17.470> have<00:02:17.500> this<00:02:17.860> wallpaper<00:02:18.400> that's

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
can see we do have this wallpaper that's

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:21.210 
can see we do have this wallpaper that's
come<00:02:18.880> on<00:02:19.000> as<00:02:19.180> well<00:02:19.560> looking<00:02:20.560> into<00:02:20.980> the

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
come on as well looking into the

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:23.760 
come on as well looking into the
wallpapers<00:02:22.030> I<00:02:22.270> can't<00:02:22.660> really<00:02:22.780> see<00:02:23.080> too<00:02:23.590> much

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:23.770 
wallpapers I can't really see too much

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:26.940 
wallpapers I can't really see too much
in<00:02:23.980> the<00:02:24.070> way<00:02:24.100> of<00:02:24.220> differences<00:02:25.740> compared<00:02:26.740> to

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
in the way of differences compared to

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.330 
in the way of differences compared to
what<00:02:27.190> there<00:02:27.340> was<00:02:27.520> before<00:02:28.590> but<00:02:29.590> this<00:02:29.800> one<00:02:30.100> does

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
what there was before but this one does

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:31.650 
what there was before but this one does
look<00:02:30.550> quite<00:02:30.790> knew<00:02:31.060> I<00:02:31.090> haven't<00:02:31.510> like

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:31.660 
look quite knew I haven't like

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:36.240 
look quite knew I haven't like
downloaded<00:02:32.260> this<00:02:32.700> so<00:02:33.700> i<00:02:34.740> don't<00:02:35.740> think<00:02:36.010> i<00:02:36.130> have

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
downloaded this so i don't think i have

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:37.950 
downloaded this so i don't think i have
anywhere<00:02:36.610> might<00:02:36.940> have<00:02:37.150> actually<00:02:37.300> it<00:02:37.840> might

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:37.960 
anywhere might have actually it might

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:40.890 
anywhere might have actually it might
have<00:02:38.080> just<00:02:38.110> restored<00:02:38.710> itself<00:02:39.190> so<00:02:39.720> but<00:02:40.720> the

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
have just restored itself so but the

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.080 
have just restored itself so but the
notification<00:02:41.710> shade<00:02:41.740> looks<00:02:42.550> so<00:02:42.820> quite

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
notification shade looks so quite

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:45.720 
notification shade looks so quite
similar<00:02:43.450> to<00:02:43.510> before<00:02:43.750> i<00:02:44.260> do<00:02:45.130> like<00:02:45.460> these

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
similar to before i do like these

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.780 
similar to before i do like these
they're<00:02:46.260> kind<00:02:47.260> of<00:02:47.440> the<00:02:47.680> animations<00:02:48.370> that<00:02:48.490> come

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
they're kind of the animations that come

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:51.000 
they're kind of the animations that come
up<00:02:48.970> when<00:02:49.570> you<00:02:49.750> click<00:02:49.990> on<00:02:50.140> things<00:02:50.500> you<00:02:50.590> can<00:02:50.770> see

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
up when you click on things you can see

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:53.820 
up when you click on things you can see
it's<00:02:51.190> like<00:02:51.340> a<00:02:51.610> lollipop<00:02:51.790> head<00:02:52.420> and<00:02:52.720> they<00:02:53.650> do

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:53.830 
it's like a lollipop head and they do

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:57.000 
it's like a lollipop head and they do
look<00:02:53.980> very<00:02:54.040> nice<00:02:54.430> and<00:02:54.820> clean<00:02:55.450> here<00:02:55.960> and<00:02:56.170> if<00:02:56.860> we

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 
look very nice and clean here and if we

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:59.910 
look very nice and clean here and if we
go<00:02:57.160> into<00:02:57.490> the<00:02:58.060> settings<00:02:58.330> you<00:02:59.170> can<00:02:59.230> see<00:02:59.650> like<00:02:59.890> a

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920 
go into the settings you can see like a

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.370 
go into the settings you can see like a
square<00:03:00.700> kind<00:03:01.120> of<00:03:01.240> animation<00:03:01.660> there<00:03:02.080> which<00:03:02.230> is

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:02.380 
square kind of animation there which is

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:05.370 
square kind of animation there which is
quite<00:03:02.620> cool<00:03:02.950> if<00:03:03.280> we<00:03:04.240> look<00:03:04.690> at<00:03:04.750> these<00:03:04.900> settings

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:05.380 
quite cool if we look at these settings

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:08.010 
quite cool if we look at these settings
we<00:03:05.830> can<00:03:06.070> see<00:03:06.370> that<00:03:06.700> everything<00:03:07.570> looks<00:03:07.690> quite

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:08.020 
we can see that everything looks quite

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:09.840 
we can see that everything looks quite
similar<00:03:08.290> really<00:03:08.800> we<00:03:08.920> get<00:03:09.070> the<00:03:09.220> ambient

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:09.850 
similar really we get the ambient

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:14.370 
similar really we get the ambient
display<00:03:10.000> still<00:03:11.220> and<00:03:12.540> also<00:03:13.540> some<00:03:14.020> of<00:03:14.050> the<00:03:14.170> other

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:14.380 
display still and also some of the other

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:18.300 
display still and also some of the other
settings<00:03:15.150> look<00:03:16.150> quite<00:03:16.420> similar<00:03:17.100> like<00:03:18.100> the

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
settings look quite similar like the

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:23.490 
settings look quite similar like the
location<00:03:18.760> and<00:03:20.520> some<00:03:21.520> other<00:03:21.760> things<00:03:21.870> as<00:03:22.870> we<00:03:23.260> got

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
location and some other things as we got

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.880 
location and some other things as we got
sound<00:03:24.070> and<00:03:24.310> notification<00:03:25.350> do<00:03:26.350> we<00:03:26.410> get<00:03:26.530> any<00:03:26.590> new

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:26.890 
sound and notification do we get any new

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:29.940 
sound and notification do we get any new
sounds<00:03:27.870> so<00:03:28.870> these<00:03:29.140> are<00:03:29.350> the<00:03:29.410> ones<00:03:29.680> that<00:03:29.770> have

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:29.950 
sounds so these are the ones that have

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:36.090 
sounds so these are the ones that have
come<00:03:30.190> with<00:03:30.700> it<00:03:30.900> by<00:03:31.900> default<00:03:33.930> so<00:03:34.930> it's<00:03:35.860> called

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:36.100 
come with it by default so it's called

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:39.920 
come with it by default so it's called
thethe<00:03:36.430> this<00:03:36.700> or<00:03:37.030> something<00:03:37.540> and<00:03:38.580> I<00:03:39.580> probably

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
thethe this or something and I probably

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:47.730 
thethe this or something and I probably
change<00:03:40.930> that<00:03:42.960> to<00:03:43.980> my<00:03:44.980> favorite<00:03:46.740> hangouts

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:47.740 
change that to my favorite hangouts

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:52.260 
change that to my favorite hangouts
which<00:03:48.250> is<00:03:48.460> the<00:03:48.610> best<00:03:49.350> and<00:03:50.350> we<00:03:50.890> can<00:03:51.190> see<00:03:51.460> that<00:03:51.490> we

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:52.270 
which is the best and we can see that we

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:54.180 
which is the best and we can see that we
get<00:03:52.480> all<00:03:52.810> the<00:03:53.140> indoor<00:03:53.470> App<00:03:53.650> Store<00:03:53.950> quite

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:54.190 
get all the indoor App Store quite

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:57.320 
get all the indoor App Store quite
similar<00:03:54.670> here<00:03:55.060> not<00:03:55.930> too<00:03:56.290> much<00:03:56.440> in<00:03:56.770> the<00:03:57.040> way<00:03:57.070> of

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:57.330 
similar here not too much in the way of

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:01.290 
similar here not too much in the way of
differences<00:03:58.330> there<00:03:59.400> and<00:04:00.400> all<00:04:00.850> the<00:04:00.880> things

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:01.300 
differences there and all the things

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:10.410 
differences there and all the things
that<00:04:01.420> we<00:04:01.660> can<00:04:01.870> have<00:04:02.080> a<00:04:02.110> look<00:04:02.230> at<00:04:02.500> is<00:04:02.680> the<00:04:03.180> camera

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:10.420 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:12.460 

don't<00:04:11.420> think<00:04:11.720> this<00:04:11.870> is<00:04:11.989> going<00:04:12.110> to<00:04:12.170> be<00:04:12.290> very

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:12.470 
don't think this is going to be very

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:14.350 
don't think this is going to be very
different<00:04:13.010> but<00:04:13.250> worthwhile<00:04:13.670> checking

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:14.360 
different but worthwhile checking

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:18.550 
different but worthwhile checking
nevertheless<00:04:15.130> as<00:04:16.130> so<00:04:16.729> you<00:04:16.790> can<00:04:17.090> see<00:04:17.359> that<00:04:17.810> we

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:18.560 
nevertheless as so you can see that we

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:20.439 
nevertheless as so you can see that we
get<00:04:18.709> quite<00:04:19.130> the<00:04:19.250> same<00:04:19.519> kind<00:04:19.729> of<00:04:19.850> options<00:04:20.329> here

00:04:20.439 --> 00:04:20.449 
get quite the same kind of options here

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:27.370 
get quite the same kind of options here
and<00:04:23.680> don't<00:04:24.680> think<00:04:25.040> there<00:04:25.639> is<00:04:25.669> much<00:04:26.510> in<00:04:27.260> the<00:04:27.350> way

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:27.380 
and don't think there is much in the way

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:29.680 
and don't think there is much in the way
of<00:04:27.530> difference<00:04:28.040> 4k<00:04:28.790> still<00:04:29.180> there<00:04:29.449> which<00:04:29.570> is

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:29.690 
of difference 4k still there which is

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:40.150 
of difference 4k still there which is
good<00:04:30.020> i<00:04:36.430> think<00:04:37.430> this<00:04:38.530> receptacle<00:04:39.530> looks<00:04:39.919> a<00:04:40.010> bit

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:40.160 
good i think this receptacle looks a bit

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:44.650 
good i think this receptacle looks a bit
different<00:04:40.220> now<00:04:41.830> which<00:04:42.830> have<00:04:43.669> not<00:04:43.880> noticed

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:44.660 
different now which have not noticed

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:50.730 
different now which have not noticed
before<00:04:44.900> maybe<00:04:45.530> I'm<00:04:45.710> just<00:04:45.860> not<00:04:46.039> very<00:04:46.100> observant

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:50.740 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:55.840 

it's<00:04:51.740> quite<00:04:51.979> cool<00:04:52.280> if<00:04:52.460> you<00:04:52.610> ask<00:04:52.639> me<00:04:53.060> I<00:04:54.850> think

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:55.850 
it's quite cool if you ask me I think

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:58.000 
it's quite cool if you ask me I think
they've<00:04:56.180> moved<00:04:56.389> the<00:04:56.720> gallery<00:04:57.139> up<00:04:57.470> here<00:04:57.860> as

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:58.010 
they've moved the gallery up here as

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:09.560 
they've moved the gallery up here as
well

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:09.570 

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:12.300 

so<00:05:10.570> it<00:05:10.630> looks<00:05:10.780> like<00:05:10.870> this<00:05:11.229> is<00:05:11.380> all<00:05:11.530> working<00:05:11.800> so

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:12.310 
so it looks like this is all working so

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:15.600 
so it looks like this is all working so
that<00:05:13.320> is<00:05:14.320> good<00:05:14.530> to<00:05:14.590> know<00:05:14.740> if<00:05:15.070> you<00:05:15.160> want<00:05:15.370> to

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:15.610 
that is good to know if you want to

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:19.020 
that is good to know if you want to
check<00:05:16.000> this<00:05:16.150> out<00:05:16.419> and<00:05:17.460> can<00:05:18.460> have<00:05:18.550> a<00:05:18.639> look<00:05:18.760> at

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:19.030 
check this out and can have a look at

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:22.830
