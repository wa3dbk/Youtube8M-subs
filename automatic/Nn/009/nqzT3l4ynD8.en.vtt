Sibelius<00:00:11.700> so<00:00:12.630> I'm<00:00:12.719> cheaper<00:00:13.049> than<00:00:13.200> spacious

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
Sibelius so I'm cheaper than spacious

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:15.589 
Sibelius so I'm cheaper than spacious
though<00:00:13.740> it's<00:00:13.950> 1099<00:00:14.790> which<00:00:15.030> is<00:00:15.269> quite

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599

though it's 1099 which is quite
expensive<00:00:15.960> for<00:00:16.410> an<00:00:16.500> app<00:00:16.710> that<00:00:17.490> was<00:00:17.609> a<00:00:17.670> very

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
straight away you have to go through a

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.230 
straight away you have to go through a
few<00:01:04.110> different<00:01:04.439> options<00:01:04.949> to<00:01:05.939> do<00:01:06.030> that<00:01:06.180> in

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
few different options to do that in

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.219 
few different options to do that in
Sibelius<00:01:07.490> all<00:01:08.490> of<00:01:08.850> the<00:01:09.060> all<00:01:09.570> the<00:01:09.780> interface<00:01:10.080> is

Sibelius all of the all the interface is

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:11.960 
Sibelius all of the all the interface is
pretty<00:01:10.439> intuitive<00:01:10.729> you've<00:01:11.729> got<00:01:11.880> three

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
pretty intuitive you've got three

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.910 
pretty intuitive you've got three
different<00:01:12.090> note<00:01:12.420> durations<00:01:13.020> rests<00:01:13.680> and

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
different note durations rests and

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.600 
different note durations rests and
accents<00:01:15.530> lots<00:01:16.530> of<00:01:16.590> the<00:01:16.770> things<00:01:16.830> there<00:01:17.189> to<00:01:17.490> go

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
accents lots of the things there to go

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.670 
accents lots of the things there to go
out<00:01:17.759> you<00:01:17.909> can<00:01:18.119> it's<00:01:19.049> like<00:01:19.110> so<00:01:19.409> it's<00:01:19.530> very

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
out you can it's like so it's very

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.380 
out you can it's like so it's very
powerful<00:01:19.920> app<00:01:20.400> and<00:01:20.759> get<00:01:20.880> pretty<00:01:21.240> much

everything that you can and Sibelius

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:26.330 
everything that you can and Sibelius
it's<00:01:23.790> very<00:01:23.970> intuitive<00:01:24.240> as<00:01:24.600> well<00:01:24.810> it's<00:01:25.250> uses<00:01:26.250> a

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:56.560 
I'm just entering a little melody here
using<00:01:54.090> crotchets<00:01:54.750> and<00:01:54.869> minims

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:56.570

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
and as you can see you can start

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:05.990 
and as you can see you can start
entering<00:02:04.920> these<00:02:05.130> melodies<00:02:05.430> very<00:02:05.820> very

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
entering these melodies very very

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.760 
entering these melodies very very
quickly<00:02:06.270> I'm<00:02:06.540> using<00:02:06.719> a<00:02:06.869> keyboard<00:02:07.110> interface

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
quickly I'm using a keyboard interface

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.900 
quickly I'm using a keyboard interface
here<00:02:08.869> because<00:02:10.009> I'm<00:02:11.009> a<00:02:11.069> keyboard<00:02:11.370> player<00:02:11.640> so<00:02:11.879> I

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
here because I'm a keyboard player so I

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.830 
here because I'm a keyboard player so I
know<00:02:12.030> no<00:02:12.629> other<00:02:12.780> notes<00:02:13.020> that<00:02:13.170> I<00:02:13.200> need<00:02:13.379> are

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
know no other notes that I need are

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.280 
know no other notes that I need are
not<00:02:14.050> a<00:02:14.080> clarinet<00:02:14.590> player<00:02:14.879> and<00:02:15.879> so<00:02:16.330> it<00:02:17.050> would<00:02:17.200> be

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
not a clarinet player and so it would be

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.199 
not a clarinet player and so it would be
a<00:02:17.319> challenge<00:02:17.680> for<00:02:17.709> me<00:02:17.890> otherwise<00:02:18.400> to<00:02:18.760> enter<00:02:19.090> it

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:19.209 
a challenge for me otherwise to enter it

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:22.710 
a challenge for me otherwise to enter it
in<00:02:19.530> transposing<00:02:20.530> as<00:02:20.830> I<00:02:21.129> go<00:02:21.450> okay<00:02:22.450> so<00:02:22.510> let's

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
in transposing as I go okay so let's

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:23.850 
in transposing as I go okay so let's
have<00:02:22.780> a<00:02:22.870> listen<00:02:22.989> to<00:02:23.200> that<00:02:23.230> melody<00:02:23.590> in<00:02:23.680> real

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
have a listen to that melody in real

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:30.970 
have a listen to that melody in real
time

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:34.740 

ah

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:37.980 

okay<00:02:35.500> I<00:02:35.530> like<00:02:35.740> the<00:02:35.830> sound<00:02:36.040> of<00:02:36.130> that<00:02:36.190> melody<00:02:36.990> but

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:37.990 
okay I like the sound of that melody but

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:39.630 
okay I like the sound of that melody but
what<00:02:38.500> I'm<00:02:38.560> gonna<00:02:38.680> do<00:02:38.800> is<00:02:38.890> change<00:02:39.280> the<00:02:39.460> last

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
what I'm gonna do is change the last

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:43.550 
what I'm gonna do is change the last
note<00:02:39.910> I'm<00:02:40.900> gonna<00:02:41.170> move<00:02:41.380> that<00:02:41.410> down<00:02:41.860> to<00:02:42.160> a<00:02:42.190> C

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
note I'm gonna move that down to a C

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.660 
note I'm gonna move that down to a C
because<00:02:44.560> I<00:02:44.620> think<00:02:44.800> it<00:02:44.890> resolves<00:02:45.280> a<00:02:45.370> little<00:02:45.580> bit

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
because I think it resolves a little bit

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:47.490 
because I think it resolves a little bit
better<00:02:45.820> now<00:02:46.510> I<00:02:46.540> start<00:02:46.840> my<00:02:46.930> trumpet<00:02:47.290> section

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
better now I start my trumpet section

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:52.110 
better now I start my trumpet section
just<00:02:48.100> going<00:02:48.370> to<00:02:48.490> add<00:02:48.940> in<00:02:49.450> some<00:02:49.810> semibreve<00:02:51.120> just

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
just going to add in some semibreve just

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:57.900 
just going to add in some semibreve just
to<00:02:52.210> fill<00:02:52.480> that<00:02:52.750> out<00:02:53.230> a<00:02:53.410> little<00:02:53.650> bit<00:02:53.920> and<00:02:56.910> then

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:57.910 
to fill that out a little bit and then

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
to fill that out a little bit and then
I'll<00:02:58.030> move<00:02:58.180> on<00:02:58.270> to<00:02:58.300> the<00:02:58.630> acoustic<00:02:59.200> guitar<00:03:00.930> they

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
I'll move on to the acoustic guitar they

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:03.810 
I'll move on to the acoustic guitar they
kind<00:03:02.140> of<00:03:02.230> cause<00:03:02.410> change<00:03:02.770> the<00:03:03.010> tempo<00:03:03.520> of<00:03:03.580> this

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:03.820 
kind of cause change the tempo of this

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:06.720 
kind of cause change the tempo of this
just<00:03:04.180> by<00:03:04.360> a<00:03:04.690> double<00:03:05.200> tapping<00:03:05.410> on<00:03:05.650> the<00:03:05.830> the

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:06.730 
just by a double tapping on the the

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:08.550 
just by a double tapping on the the
crotchet<00:03:07.090> symbol<00:03:07.300> at<00:03:07.360> the<00:03:07.390> top<00:03:07.450> there

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
crotchet symbol at the top there

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.610 
crotchet symbol at the top there
okay<00:03:09.010> acoustics<00:03:09.430> off<00:03:10.110> so<00:03:11.110> you<00:03:11.200> can<00:03:11.320> change<00:03:11.500> the

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
okay acoustics off so you can change the

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.010 
okay acoustics off so you can change the
interface<00:03:12.000> quite<00:03:13.000> easily<00:03:13.150> to<00:03:13.480> the<00:03:13.720> fretboard

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:14.020 
interface quite easily to the fretboard

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:16.640 
interface quite easily to the fretboard
of<00:03:14.230> guitar<00:03:14.560> so<00:03:15.160> if<00:03:15.250> you<00:03:15.370> are<00:03:15.550> guitarist<00:03:16.180> and

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
of guitar so if you are guitarist and

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:18.600 
of guitar so if you are guitarist and
you're<00:03:17.650> going<00:03:17.770> to<00:03:17.830> find<00:03:17.980> a<00:03:18.040> lot<00:03:18.190> easier<00:03:18.490> to

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:18.610 
you're going to find a lot easier to

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:22.310 
you're going to find a lot easier to
work<00:03:18.700> this<00:03:18.820> way<00:03:19.030> so<00:03:19.990> I'm<00:03:20.110> going<00:03:20.290> to<00:03:20.350> put<00:03:20.500> in<00:03:20.650> a<00:03:21.300> C

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:22.320 
work this way so I'm going to put in a C

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:25.680 
work this way so I'm going to put in a C
chord<00:03:23.320> and<00:03:23.910> you<00:03:24.910> can<00:03:25.060> see<00:03:25.180> I've<00:03:25.300> switched<00:03:25.450> over

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:25.690 
chord and you can see I've switched over

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:28.800 
chord and you can see I've switched over
to<00:03:25.840> the<00:03:26.170> layering<00:03:26.920> note<00:03:27.340> option<00:03:28.240> so<00:03:28.750> I<00:03:28.780> can

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:28.810 
to the layering note option so I can

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:30.060 
to the layering note option so I can
layer<00:03:29.080> the<00:03:29.170> notes<00:03:29.320> on<00:03:29.440> top<00:03:29.620> of<00:03:29.709> each<00:03:29.800> other<00:03:30.040> so

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:30.070 
layer the notes on top of each other so

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:32.670 
layer the notes on top of each other so
it<00:03:30.400> sounds<00:03:31.000> like<00:03:31.060> a<00:03:31.150> strum<00:03:31.630> through<00:03:32.080> a<00:03:32.110> through

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:32.680 
it sounds like a strum through a through

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:35.220 
it sounds like a strum through a through
an<00:03:32.740> acoustic<00:03:33.070> guitar<00:03:33.480> as<00:03:34.480> that<00:03:34.690> sound<00:03:35.020> isn't

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.230 
an acoustic guitar as that sound isn't

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:37.290 
an acoustic guitar as that sound isn't
isn't<00:03:35.650> the<00:03:35.830> best<00:03:36.010> acoustic<00:03:36.459> guitar<00:03:36.700> sound<00:03:36.970> but

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:37.300 
isn't the best acoustic guitar sound but

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:39.479 
isn't the best acoustic guitar sound but
it's<00:03:37.510> pretty<00:03:37.840> good<00:03:38.200> and<00:03:39.010> the<00:03:39.100> main<00:03:39.250> thing<00:03:39.430> is

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:39.489 
it's pretty good and the main thing is

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:42.479 
it's pretty good and the main thing is
the<00:03:39.790> e<00:03:39.820> getting<00:03:40.209> the<00:03:40.300> notes<00:03:40.510> on<00:03:40.720> there<00:03:41.370> so<00:03:42.370> just

00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:42.489 
the e getting the notes on there so just

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:43.890 
the e getting the notes on there so just
tapping<00:03:42.880> on<00:03:42.970> the<00:03:43.060> fretboard<00:03:43.269> there<00:03:43.660> to<00:03:43.810> get

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:43.900 
tapping on the fretboard there to get

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:46.229 
tapping on the fretboard there to get
the<00:03:43.989> next<00:03:44.140> that<00:03:44.320> I<00:03:44.350> need<00:03:44.530> and<00:03:45.459> you'll<00:03:46.090> notice

00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:46.239 
the next that I need and you'll notice

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:48.180 
the next that I need and you'll notice
as<00:03:46.450> well<00:03:46.600> it's<00:03:46.780> putting<00:03:47.110> in<00:03:47.290> the<00:03:47.410> tablature

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:48.190 
as well it's putting in the tablature

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:53.100 
as well it's putting in the tablature
for<00:03:48.370> me<00:03:49.440> so<00:03:50.440> I<00:03:50.470> can<00:03:50.530> use<00:03:50.769> the<00:03:50.890> tablature<00:03:52.110> to

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:53.110 
for me so I can use the tablature to

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:54.570 
for me so I can use the tablature to
display<00:03:53.470> this<00:03:53.620> to<00:03:53.739> someone<00:03:54.040> who<00:03:54.160> maybe<00:03:54.280> can't

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:54.580 
display this to someone who maybe can't

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:56.850 
display this to someone who maybe can't
be<00:03:54.670> music<00:03:55.000> but<00:03:55.150> can<00:03:55.300> read<00:03:55.450> temperature<00:03:55.989> that's

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:56.860 
be music but can read temperature that's

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:58.400

I'm<00:04:48.750> using<00:04:49.650> their<00:04:49.920> keyboard<00:04:50.310> interface<00:04:50.520> and

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:51.860 
I'm using their keyboard interface and

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:54.800 
I'm using their keyboard interface and
see<00:04:52.860> if<00:04:52.920> it<00:04:52.980> does<00:04:53.100> a<00:04:53.130> good<00:04:53.280> job<00:04:53.340> of<00:04:53.910> come<00:04:54.390> from

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:54.810 
see if it does a good job of come from

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:57.940 
see if it does a good job of come from
quantizing<00:04:55.560> that<00:04:55.740> and<00:04:56.100> getting<00:04:56.280> it<00:04:56.430> in<00:04:56.550> there

00:04:57.940 --> 00:04:57.950 
quantizing that and getting it in there

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:59.990 
quantizing that and getting it in there
so<00:04:58.950> I'm<00:04:59.010> just<00:04:59.130> turning<00:04:59.310> fit<00:04:59.580> around<00:04:59.820> now<00:04:59.940> to

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:00.000 
so I'm just turning fit around now to

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.260 
so I'm just turning fit around now to
see<00:05:00.210> if<00:05:00.270> I<00:05:00.330> can<00:05:00.450> find<00:05:00.540> the<00:05:00.660> melody<00:05:00.900> that<00:05:01.020> I<00:05:01.050> want

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:02.270 
see if I can find the melody that I want

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:08.060 
see if I can find the melody that I want
and<00:05:04.160> I<00:05:05.160> can<00:05:05.610> start<00:05:05.760> recording<00:05:06.110> it<00:05:07.110> that<00:05:07.350> gives

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:08.070 
and I can start recording it that gives

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:24.920 
and I can start recording it that gives
me<00:05:08.250> a<00:05:08.280> 1<00:05:08.700> bar<00:05:08.880> counting<00:05:23.660> okay<00:05:24.660> and<00:05:24.780> I<00:05:24.810> just

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:24.930 
me a 1 bar counting okay and I just

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:26.270 
me a 1 bar counting okay and I just
going<00:05:25.020> to<00:05:25.110> do<00:05:25.170> the<00:05:25.290> same<00:05:25.470> thing<00:05:25.650> now<00:05:25.800> with<00:05:26.040> the
