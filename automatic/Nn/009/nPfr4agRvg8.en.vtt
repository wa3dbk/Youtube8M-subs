before<00:00:32.619> the<00:00:32.830> ipad<00:00:33.160> came<00:00:33.460> out<00:00:33.640> a<00:00:33.940> lot<00:00:34.660> of<00:00:34.780> people

00:00:35.009 --> 00:00:35.019 
before the ipad came out a lot of people

00:00:35.019 --> 00:00:36.240 
before the ipad came out a lot of people
were<00:00:35.110> saying<00:00:35.410> this<00:00:35.680> thing<00:00:35.920> is<00:00:36.010> going<00:00:36.160> to

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:36.250 
were saying this thing is going to

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:38.580 
were saying this thing is going to
change<00:00:36.519> the<00:00:37.300> way<00:00:37.420> we<00:00:37.600> look<00:00:37.720> at<00:00:37.900> computers<00:00:38.350> and

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:38.590 
change the way we look at computers and

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:42.119 
change the way we look at computers and
I<00:00:39.100> thought<00:00:39.489> yeah<00:00:40.269> maybe<00:00:40.960> but<00:00:41.559> it's<00:00:41.860> really

00:00:42.119 --> 00:00:42.129 
I thought yeah maybe but it's really

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:45.210 
I thought yeah maybe but it's really
just<00:00:42.250> a<00:00:42.580> giant<00:00:42.760> ipod<00:00:43.059> touch<00:00:43.629> right<00:00:44.350> it<00:00:45.100> would

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:45.220 
just a giant ipod touch right it would

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:47.490 
just a giant ipod touch right it would
do<00:00:45.340> exactly<00:00:45.519> the<00:00:46.089> same<00:00:46.120> stuff<00:00:46.720> it<00:00:47.080> would<00:00:47.229> fit

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:47.500 
do exactly the same stuff it would fit

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.759 
do exactly the same stuff it would fit
the<00:00:47.530> exact<00:00:48.100> same<00:00:48.430> demographic<00:00:49.210> I<00:00:49.530> was<00:00:50.530> wrong

really<00:01:03.519> has<00:01:03.699> created<00:01:04.030> this<00:01:04.239> new<00:01:04.600> class<00:01:05.409> of

00:01:05.789 --> 00:01:05.799 
really has created this new class of

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:08.609 
really has created this new class of
computing<00:01:06.630> that's<00:01:07.630> in<00:01:07.810> between<00:01:07.900> something

00:01:08.609 --> 00:01:08.619 
computing that's in between something

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:11.700 
computing that's in between something
like<00:01:08.860> an<00:01:09.010> iPhone<00:01:09.400> or<00:01:09.610> an<00:01:09.700> iPod<00:01:10.060> Touch<00:01:10.330> and<00:01:10.710> a

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:11.710 
like an iPhone or an iPod Touch and a

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:15.539 
like an iPhone or an iPod Touch and a
laptop<00:01:12.510> it<00:01:13.510> can<00:01:13.780> do<00:01:13.990> so<00:01:14.020> much<00:01:14.470> more<00:01:14.530> than<00:01:15.460> an

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:15.549 
laptop it can do so much more than an

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:19.800 
laptop it can do so much more than an
ipod<00:01:15.909> touch<00:01:16.180> or<00:01:16.420> an<00:01:17.049> iPod<00:01:17.979> or<00:01:18.250> an<00:01:18.910> iPhone<00:01:19.060> or

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:19.810 
ipod touch or an iPod or an iPhone or

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:22.860 
ipod touch or an iPod or an iPhone or
PDA<00:01:20.140> or<00:01:20.680> something<00:01:21.160> like<00:01:21.280> that<00:01:21.340> but<00:01:22.210> again<00:01:22.600> it

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:22.870 
PDA or something like that but again it

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
PDA or something like that but again it
is<00:01:22.960> not<00:01:23.170> quite<00:01:23.530> as<00:01:23.670> functional<00:01:24.670> as<00:01:24.720> a<00:01:25.720> mac<00:01:26.530> or<00:01:26.800> a

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:26.890 
is not quite as functional as a mac or a

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:29.610 
is not quite as functional as a mac or a
pc<00:01:27.570> and<00:01:28.570> that's<00:01:28.750> I<00:01:28.930> think<00:01:28.960> what<00:01:29.290> I<00:01:29.350> like<00:01:29.590> about

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:29.620 
pc and that's I think what I like about

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:32.880 
pc and that's I think what I like about
it<00:01:29.950> so<00:01:30.250> much<00:01:30.400> is<00:01:30.880> it<00:01:31.210> it<00:01:31.390> blends<00:01:31.750> the<00:01:32.350> best<00:01:32.620> of

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:32.890 
it so much is it it blends the best of

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:35.460 
it so much is it it blends the best of
both<00:01:33.070> of<00:01:33.130> those<00:01:33.520> together<00:01:34.080> and<00:01:35.080> makes<00:01:35.350> them

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:35.470 
both of those together and makes them

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:38.010 
both of those together and makes them
into<00:01:35.740> this<00:01:35.860> kind<00:01:36.190> of<00:01:36.310> really<00:01:36.940> handy<00:01:37.750> and

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:38.020 
into this kind of really handy and

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:40.230 
into this kind of really handy and
simple<00:01:38.590> device<00:01:38.860> that<00:01:39.280> you<00:01:39.400> can<00:01:39.610> take<00:01:39.910> out<00:01:40.090> and

not just limited to those two i could

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:57.009 
not just limited to those two i could
turn<00:03:54.709> it<00:03:54.890> the<00:03:54.980> other<00:03:55.010> way<00:03:55.220> up<00:03:55.459> i<00:03:55.640> can<00:03:55.940> even<00:03:56.060> have

00:03:57.009 --> 00:03:57.019 
turn it the other way up i can even have

00:03:57.019 --> 00:03:59.890 
turn it the other way up i can even have
this<00:03:57.170> thing<00:03:57.380> upside<00:03:57.890> down<00:03:58.190> and<00:03:58.549> it<00:03:59.420> will

00:03:59.890 --> 00:03:59.900 
this thing upside down and it will

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:02.770 
this thing upside down and it will
always<00:04:00.049> flip<00:04:00.769> down<00:04:00.980> to<00:04:01.340> where<00:04:01.790> gravity<00:04:02.060> is<00:04:02.330> and

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:02.780 
always flip down to where gravity is and

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:03.850 
always flip down to where gravity is and
i<00:04:02.840> think<00:04:02.870> that's<00:04:03.140> really<00:04:03.290> cool<00:04:03.620> because

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:03.860

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:05.630 
i think that's really cool because
whichever<00:04:04.730> way<00:04:04.910> i<00:04:04.970> want<00:04:05.180> to<00:04:05.269> sit

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:05.640 
whichever way i want to sit

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:07.250 
whichever way i want to sit
say<00:04:05.760> honest<00:04:06.030> it<00:04:06.210> kind<00:04:06.450> of<00:04:06.480> like<00:04:06.630> this<00:04:06.870> and<00:04:07.170> have

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:07.260 
say honest it kind of like this and have

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.200 
say honest it kind of like this and have
it<00:04:07.290> like<00:04:07.530> that<00:04:07.710> or<00:04:07.980> maybe<00:04:08.430> I<00:04:08.550> want<00:04:08.700> to<00:04:08.730> turn<00:04:09.000> it

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:09.210 
it like that or maybe I want to turn it

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:12.949 
it like that or maybe I want to turn it
or<00:04:09.560> maybe<00:04:10.560> I'm<00:04:10.800> I<00:04:11.069> don't<00:04:11.280> know<00:04:11.780> putting<00:04:12.780> it<00:04:12.870> on

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:12.959 
or maybe I'm I don't know putting it on

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:15.260 
or maybe I'm I don't know putting it on
a<00:04:13.020> desk<00:04:13.260> it<00:04:14.069> will<00:04:14.220> always<00:04:14.370> flip<00:04:14.760> up<00:04:14.910> to<00:04:15.180> the

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:15.270 
a desk it will always flip up to the

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:16.280 
a desk it will always flip up to the
right<00:04:15.390> way<00:04:15.569> and<00:04:15.780> that's<00:04:15.959> because<00:04:16.079> of<00:04:16.260> the

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:16.290 
right way and that's because of the

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:18.259 
right way and that's because of the
accelerometer<00:04:17.010> inside<00:04:17.280> the<00:04:17.730> iphone<00:04:18.060> does<00:04:18.239> a

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:18.269 
accelerometer inside the iphone does a

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:20.569 
accelerometer inside the iphone does a
very<00:04:18.359> similar<00:04:18.750> job<00:04:19.560> with<00:04:19.799> that<00:04:19.829> except<00:04:20.430> it

00:04:20.569 --> 00:04:20.579 
very similar job with that except it

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:22.520 
very similar job with that except it
just<00:04:20.760> doesn't<00:04:21.090> it<00:04:21.299> doesn't<00:04:21.600> flip<00:04:22.079> every<00:04:22.410> way

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:22.530 
just doesn't it doesn't flip every way

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:24.140 
just doesn't it doesn't flip every way
that<00:04:22.680> it<00:04:22.800> should<00:04:22.830> if<00:04:23.520> you<00:04:23.700> don't<00:04:23.850> own<00:04:24.000> you

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:24.150 
that it should if you don't own you

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:27.220 
that it should if you don't own you
sometimes<00:04:24.900> you<00:04:25.560> can<00:04:25.710> only<00:04:25.830> have<00:04:26.040> it<00:04:26.220> in<00:04:26.400> one

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:27.230 
sometimes you can only have it in one

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:29.270 
sometimes you can only have it in one
landscape<00:04:28.230> mode<00:04:28.440> you<00:04:28.620> can't<00:04:28.830> have<00:04:29.010> it<00:04:29.040> you

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:29.280 
landscape mode you can't have it you

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:31.310 
landscape mode you can't have it you
know<00:04:29.400> the<00:04:29.610> other<00:04:29.820> way<00:04:30.030> in<00:04:30.330> landscapes<00:04:31.080> so<00:04:31.260> I

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:31.320 
know the other way in landscapes so I

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:34.250 
know the other way in landscapes so I
think<00:04:31.380> that's<00:04:31.590> really<00:04:31.890> cool<00:04:32.250> a<00:04:33.110> few<00:04:34.110> things

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:34.260 
think that's really cool a few things

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.080 
think that's really cool a few things
that<00:04:34.590> I<00:04:34.620> would<00:04:34.830> like<00:04:34.980> to<00:04:35.010> see<00:04:35.370> in<00:04:35.640> a<00:04:35.760> future

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:36.090 
that I would like to see in a future

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:37.640 
that I would like to see in a future
version<00:04:36.360> of<00:04:36.630> the<00:04:36.720> ipad<00:04:37.020> I<00:04:37.260> think<00:04:37.500> it's

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:37.650 
version of the ipad I think it's

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:40.310 
version of the ipad I think it's
important<00:04:38.070> to<00:04:38.130> talk<00:04:38.310> about<00:04:38.600> one<00:04:39.600> is<00:04:39.750> a<00:04:39.780> camera

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:40.320 
important to talk about one is a camera

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:43.460 
important to talk about one is a camera
and<00:04:40.560> I<00:04:41.100> found<00:04:41.490> it<00:04:41.700> you<00:04:42.570> know<00:04:42.720> one<00:04:42.930> before<00:04:43.290> I<00:04:43.350> had

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:43.470 
and I found it you know one before I had

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:44.870 
and I found it you know one before I had
the<00:04:43.500> device<00:04:43.800> i<00:04:44.010> was<00:04:44.100> like<00:04:44.190> air<00:04:44.430> you<00:04:44.640> know<00:04:44.730> what

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:44.880 
the device i was like air you know what

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:46.640 
the device i was like air you know what
camera<00:04:45.240> isn't<00:04:45.450> really<00:04:45.600> that<00:04:45.720> important<00:04:46.169> but<00:04:46.320> i

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:46.650 
camera isn't really that important but i

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:48.650 
camera isn't really that important but i
really<00:04:46.919> see<00:04:47.100> how<00:04:47.250> camera<00:04:47.669> could<00:04:47.910> be<00:04:48.480> very

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:48.660 
really see how camera could be very

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:52.250 
really see how camera could be very
beneficial<00:04:48.810> to<00:04:49.320> this<00:04:49.590> device<00:04:50.960> all<00:04:51.960> of<00:04:52.140> the

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:52.260 
beneficial to this device all of the

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:53.780 
beneficial to this device all of the
apps<00:04:52.410> on<00:04:52.800> this<00:04:52.919> device<00:04:53.190> could<00:04:53.460> take<00:04:53.640> advantage

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:53.790 
apps on this device could take advantage

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:55.670 
apps on this device could take advantage
of<00:04:54.180> a<00:04:54.270> camera<00:04:54.600> the<00:04:54.840> YouTube<00:04:55.230> app<00:04:55.380> which<00:04:55.650> is

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:55.680

another<00:05:12.780> really<00:05:13.020> good<00:05:13.229> example<00:05:13.290> where<00:05:13.770> I<00:05:13.830> see

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:14.130 
another really good example where I see

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:16.490 
another really good example where I see
a<00:05:14.160> camera<00:05:14.520> useful<00:05:15.150> of<00:05:15.630> the<00:05:15.810> ipad<00:05:16.110> is<00:05:16.169> with

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:16.500 
a camera useful of the ipad is with

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:19.130 
a camera useful of the ipad is with
skype<00:05:17.180> skype<00:05:18.180> haven't<00:05:18.510> come<00:05:18.630> out<00:05:18.660> with<00:05:18.930> an<00:05:19.050> app

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:19.140 
skype skype haven't come out with an app

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:20.900 
skype skype haven't come out with an app
for<00:05:19.350> the<00:05:19.410> ipad<00:05:19.860> yet<00:05:20.160> at<00:05:20.460> least<00:05:20.520> i<00:05:20.820> don't

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:20.910 
for the ipad yet at least i don't

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:23.180 
for the ipad yet at least i don't
believe<00:05:21.180> they<00:05:21.330> have<00:05:21.540> but<00:05:22.530> imagine<00:05:22.919> if<00:05:23.040> you

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:23.190 
believe they have but imagine if you

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:26.240 
believe they have but imagine if you
were<00:05:23.340> able<00:05:23.610> to<00:05:23.910> and<00:05:24.870> this<00:05:25.020> is<00:05:25.200> leading<00:05:25.950> into<00:05:26.130> my

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:26.250 
were able to and this is leading into my

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:27.740 
were able to and this is leading into my
next<00:05:26.460> point<00:05:26.700> is<00:05:26.850> that<00:05:27.030> maybe<00:05:27.210> the<00:05:27.450> camera

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:27.750 
next point is that maybe the camera

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:29.270 
next point is that maybe the camera
doesn't<00:05:27.930> need<00:05:28.110> to<00:05:28.200> be<00:05:28.290> built<00:05:28.500> into<00:05:28.740> the<00:05:28.950> ipad

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:29.280 
doesn't need to be built into the ipad

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:30.560 
doesn't need to be built into the ipad
but<00:05:29.430> that<00:05:29.580> it<00:05:29.669> can<00:05:29.820> be<00:05:29.910> an<00:05:30.000> accessory<00:05:30.330> that

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:30.570 
but that it can be an accessory that

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:32.570 
but that it can be an accessory that
could<00:05:30.780> go<00:05:30.870> into<00:05:30.990> the<00:05:31.169> dock<00:05:31.350> connector<00:05:31.830> imagine

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:32.580 
could go into the dock connector imagine

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:34.100 
could go into the dock connector imagine
if<00:05:32.669> you<00:05:32.790> were<00:05:32.850> able<00:05:32.940> to<00:05:33.180> set<00:05:33.540> your<00:05:33.660> right<00:05:33.840> hand

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:34.110 
if you were able to set your right hand

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:36.860 
if you were able to set your right hand
up<00:05:34.430> kind<00:05:35.430> of<00:05:35.460> like<00:05:35.640> that<00:05:35.880> have<00:05:36.419> the<00:05:36.570> skype
