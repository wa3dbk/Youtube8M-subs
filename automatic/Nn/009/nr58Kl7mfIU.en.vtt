00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:05.190
 so we removed the impeller 

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:18.420
 see here it is the impeller bolts the spider 

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:21.880
 belt and now 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:27.519
 began need to be drained first antifreeze to 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:33.610
 drain Solu what a thing is here we 

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:37.320
 there is a tap on the block 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:41.850
 put on a rubber tube 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:53.289
 opened the cork radiator 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:56.980
 put vylaz flows yet this is your 

00:00:53.289 --> 00:00:59.820
 Lanochka he flows antifreeze into aluminum 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:59.820
 goose 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:07.960
 at the union these participants did in them 

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:10.560
 baked at this very well and now it turned out 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:15.430
 that it is harmful aluminum 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:17.670
 press did not give using so here 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:22.950
 so already antifreeze sat down 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.950
 now proceed to the removal of the pump 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:34.090
 then removed my pump 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:37.970
 After all , here it is easy and simple 4 Gadget and 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:42.680
 plus tensioner tensioner there problems 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:46.290
 I burst now I'll go show you 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:51.830
 mean about tensioner 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:57.500
 the problem can be seen now here is a burst 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:02:01.590
 Now you need to clean up the grinder 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:02.460
 make a channel q and brew that went in 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:06.000
 this disappeared 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:08.459
 Now, about pump and a little bit there 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.490
 disappointments here the guy didn't say there 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:13.380
 it's not that disappointing that little rabbits 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:15.090
 here's an old pump impeller 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:18.360
 just a few millimeters 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:20.000
 more than new items but look 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:25.110
 here for 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:28.650
 impeller see all processed no 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:30.360
 no nothing like here if she water 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.970
 through itself worth antifreeze 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:36.860
 no twists no noise 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:41.280
 No, but in this pump in the new one, he sees 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:44.640
 what can it do and nothing 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:49.680
 I know, but that's how I logically 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:53.970
 wrong you could walk but 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:57.180
 This pump seems to be Czech 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:03:00.299
 She's there who knows with a tapered one 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:04.980
 it's the problem of this so all 

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:08.340
 ok well if so leave us going 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:11.480
 and on him and on everything else so i think 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.480
 that everything is fine and 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:18.980
 hear old bad 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:26.870
 new and the same she even greasy herself 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:31.260
 pripy creaks squeaks 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:34.530
 Well , such things gave laying on this 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:36.990
 pump was also paper and left her 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:39.840
 now you yourself will insert it 

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:41.850
 new gasket without nothing 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:47.280
 sealant without all 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:49.830
 well, I will continue to continue further 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:53.100
 that means I show in parables 

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:55.980
 tensioner like this I am his grinder 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:58.730
 cleared now I will cook 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:58.730
 by welding 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:06.840
 here is our lever after swarovski yet 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:10.560
 hot i see you buy anything 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:14.550
 do not need everything and boil everything will be 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:22.350
 cool all cleared grinder now 

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:25.500
 put it in its place and collect everything well 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:29.430
 that's all arranged in place see 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:32.220
 there is what we brewed for cleaning 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:34.650
 Bulgarian everything is fine everything is fine here 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:36.169
 now i want to show again i take for 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:42.930
 impeller 

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:45.870
 listen see all the knock stopped there 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:48.060
 bearing was still as I thought well 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:48.720
 now let's hope that we have this one 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:54.470
 thing 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:59.120
 nothing we do not hurt me in terms of where 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:05:05.340
 5 nodules of metal everything will be fine 

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:10.169
 Well, I will inform you about it. 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:12.020
 Now I will pour antifreeze and that's it 

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:15.770
 pump we changed 

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:15.770
