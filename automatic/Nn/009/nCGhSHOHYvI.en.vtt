00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:09.830
 with a recipe that you will love is 

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:11.900
 a very easy to do botanita for 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:13.910
 this Sunday that is the day of the world 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:15.920
 the World Cup is over so I have a 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:17.840
 good news begins between four years 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:20.599
 so let's start doing it 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:22.489
 we are minced shrimp I chop it to 

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:25.000
 of course I hand Rabito 

00:00:22.489 --> 00:00:25.000
 onion 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:32.210
 I have water chestnuts that I bought them in 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:36.100
 the super or I can replace it with cup 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:36.100
 finely chopped jicama 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.960
 I have rice vinegar 

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:46.950
 I have ginger again 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:54.000
 I have egg white, I'm going to put it 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:58.490
 at the end so that I can see how much I need 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:01.160
 I have corn starch 

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:05.800
 these shrimp balls are very 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:05.800
 Japanese are going to love it 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:16.960
 I feel that I do not need to put him 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.640
 humidity but I need the addition that 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:22.260
 I will give the clear one the clear one is the 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.260
 resistor for this recipe 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:26.820
 and let's mix perfectly 

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:33.100
 it's over and I'm going to leave it inside 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.280
 of the respirator to approximate about 10 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:38.020
 15 minutes and since I have some balls 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.730
 previously made that the only thing 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:42.310
 you need is to make them go through panko 

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:45.710
 or by bread crushed bread with are flakes of 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:48.260
 very Japanese bread 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:52.140
 we passed them perfectly by the bank 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:54.090
 we make little balls 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:57.050
 and here they were already past but you 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:59.630
 It is very pass twice 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:00.890
 and I have very, very hot oil 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:05.810
 Oil has an approximate temperature 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:07.310
 of 350 degrees also 350 but I think 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:09.170
 which is a temperature that we need 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.450
 Always know what you are at home 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.430
 ortega if you have a thermometer for 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:15.260
 oil for sweet is very good to have it 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:17.120
 also at home if we do not know 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:20.510
 perfectly that when it starts to 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:23.210
 drive or suddenly put on like a piece 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:27.100
 of bread we can see how they are already 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:27.100
 starting to warm up perfectly 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:31.230
 there we are, the balls are 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.410
 perfectly well done I spent two 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:36.800
 times by panko 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:38.930
 I also have my hot oven as I 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:41.960
 they are going to leave approximately 40 I am going to 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:44.300
 give a tip we can go taking out look 

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:45.890
 well we squeeze them on paper towels 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:47.810
 absorbent and then I pass them to a 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:49.820
 tray this tray I think mother 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:52.160
 help them when they are all 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:54.260
 lists the goals to a heat shock of 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:56.030
 approximate between five minutes and I 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.960
 all couples are hot 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:01.220
 now we are going to put them to fry but 

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:03.980
 before it's going to be my sauce that the sauce is 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:06.610
 very easy to make is to put jam 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:06.610
 vulgar 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:11.329
 how about lack of soy 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:17.819
 How about a Chinese sauce called 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:17.819
 laughter 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:27.159
 I always say to you yes, but it is not 

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:28.840
 it is seen txagorritxu ricacha I am going to 

00:03:27.159 --> 00:03:31.420
 put the lemon juice always a 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:34.709
 acid is very good 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:34.709
 and the onion habitats 

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:40.040
 that's all he did for my sauce me 

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:42.799
 It will be spectacular 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:45.530
 and my oil we can see how they start 

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:47.450
 to form these small little holes 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:48.980
 you see what you can see 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:51.739
 see this oil when we were doing 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:53.180
 I already have some lists of course and 

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:56.450
 all I have to do is start 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:59.150
 to add myself and I will work on them 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:01.879
 parts I will work four by four 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:03.769
 and every one that took the four left 

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:06.049
 again that my oil goes back to 

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:08.090
 warm up if I put them immediately 

00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:10.430
 the oil does not have the same temperature 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:12.980
 then I passed a deep frying as 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:15.680
 this is the seventh table we throw 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:17.299
 We take these balls out and let them 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:19.220
 take the temperature again and 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:21.560
 we added these remained to the recipe if
