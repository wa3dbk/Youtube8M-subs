this let's assume that I've got a 2400

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.470 
this let's assume that I've got a 2400
maintenance<00:00:47.610> calorie<00:00:47.969> number<00:00:48.239> that<00:00:48.390> I'm

working<00:00:48.600> with<00:00:48.899> every<00:00:49.170> day<00:00:49.320> basically<00:00:49.739> I<00:00:49.890> need

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
working with every day basically I need

working with every day basically I need
2400<00:00:51.030> calories<00:00:51.149> a<00:00:51.390> day<00:00:51.480> to<00:00:51.600> maintain<00:00:51.750> my

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
2400 calories a day to maintain my

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.529 
2400 calories a day to maintain my
current<00:00:52.500> body<00:00:52.649> weight<00:00:52.890> so<00:00:53.789> I'm<00:00:54.059> assuming<00:00:54.329> that

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
current body weight so I'm assuming that

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.000 
current body weight so I'm assuming that
every<00:00:54.809> time<00:00:54.960> I<00:00:54.989> do<00:00:55.110> one<00:00:55.199> of<00:00:55.379> these<00:00:55.440> 24-hour

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
not eating that day so that's basically

you just go and make up all the calories
that<00:01:41.909> you<00:01:42.030> lost<00:01:42.270> by<00:01:42.780> doing<00:01:43.110> the<00:01:43.170> fast<00:01:43.409> to<00:01:43.590> begin

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
that you lost by doing the fast to begin

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.280 
that you lost by doing the fast to begin
with<00:01:44.040> my<00:01:44.640> answer<00:01:45.000> to<00:01:45.090> that<00:01:45.119> is<00:01:45.299> no<00:01:45.930> it's<00:01:46.170> not

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
with my answer to that is no it's not

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:47.630 
with my answer to that is no it's not
going<00:01:46.500> to<00:01:46.560> tire<00:01:46.770> lee<00:01:46.920> defeat<00:01:47.159> the<00:01:47.280> purpose

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
going to tire lee defeat the purpose

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.010 
going to tire lee defeat the purpose
although<00:01:47.909> it<00:01:48.030> wouldn't<00:01:48.299> be<00:01:48.390> recommended

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
although it wouldn't be recommended

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.899 
although it wouldn't be recommended
because<00:01:49.380> if<00:01:49.710> your<00:01:49.829> goal<00:01:50.009> is<00:01:50.040> primarily<00:01:50.610> fat

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
because if your goal is primarily fat

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.090 
because if your goal is primarily fat
loss<00:01:51.210> I<00:01:51.479> would<00:01:51.930> have<00:01:52.110> you<00:01:52.229> say<00:01:52.470> a<00:01:52.500> maintenance

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
loss I would have you say a maintenance

the<00:01:55.170> week<00:01:55.320> that<00:01:55.500> you<00:01:55.619> do<00:01:55.740> actually<00:01:55.920> and<00:01:56.430> then

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
the week that you do actually and then

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.370 
the week that you do actually and then
not<00:01:56.969> really<00:01:57.240> do<00:01:57.390> anything<00:01:57.420> to<00:01:57.869> add<00:01:58.110> any

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
not really do anything to add any

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.109 
not really do anything to add any
additional<00:01:58.619> calories<00:01:59.280> on<00:01:59.430> top<00:01:59.579> of<00:01:59.790> it<00:01:59.880> for<00:02:00.030> the

week

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.810

why<00:02:00.899> because<00:02:01.560> doing<00:02:01.740> those<00:02:01.950> too<00:02:02.130> fast<00:02:02.460> creates

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
why because doing those too fast creates

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.850 
why because doing those too fast creates
what<00:02:03.000> I<00:02:03.030> call<00:02:03.299> an<00:02:03.420> effortless<00:02:03.930> deficit<00:02:04.500> so

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
what I call an effortless deficit so

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.620 
what I call an effortless deficit so
unless<00:02:05.100> you<00:02:05.250> do<00:02:05.399> something<00:02:05.700> to<00:02:06.090> basically

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
unless you do something to basically

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.180 
unless you do something to basically
hurt<00:02:06.869> yourself<00:02:07.320> in<00:02:07.469> terms<00:02:07.680> of<00:02:07.829> creating<00:02:08.069> that

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
hurt yourself in terms of creating that

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.889 
hurt yourself in terms of creating that
deficit<00:02:08.700> like<00:02:08.879> eating<00:02:09.270> way<00:02:09.509> more<00:02:09.720> calories

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
deficit like eating way more calories

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:10.609 
deficit like eating way more calories
than<00:02:10.289> you

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
than you

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.320 
than you
on<00:02:10.860> the<00:02:10.950> days<00:02:11.129> when<00:02:11.310> you<00:02:11.430> eat<00:02:11.580> you're<00:02:12.209> gonna

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
on the days when you eat you're gonna

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.690 
on the days when you eat you're gonna
experience<00:02:12.780> like<00:02:13.319> you<00:02:13.470> said<00:02:13.680> a<00:02:13.709> 1400<00:02:14.400> calorie

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
experience like you said a 1400 calorie

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.910 
experience like you said a 1400 calorie
deficit<00:02:15.239> every<00:02:15.599> week<00:02:15.780> that<00:02:16.319> you<00:02:16.470> didn't<00:02:16.830> have

and doing fasted cardio especially past

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:26.630 
and doing fasted cardio especially past
18-hour<00:02:24.780> fasted<00:02:25.319> point<00:02:25.560> during<00:02:26.129> those<00:02:26.220> 24

18-hour fasted point during those 24

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.190 
18-hour fasted point during those 24
hour<00:02:26.730> fasts<00:02:27.120> you're<00:02:27.540> gonna<00:02:27.629> be<00:02:27.780> creating<00:02:28.140> a

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
hour fasts you're gonna be creating a

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.899 
hour fasts you're gonna be creating a
calorie<00:02:28.530> deficit<00:02:28.980> that's<00:02:29.190> much<00:02:29.430> larger<00:02:29.819> than

00:02:29.899 --> 00:02:29.909 
calorie deficit that's much larger than

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:31.880 
calorie deficit that's much larger than
4,800<00:02:30.599> a<00:02:30.659> week<00:02:30.840> and<00:02:31.079> you're<00:02:31.409> gonna<00:02:31.470> be<00:02:31.680> burning

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
4,800 a week and you're gonna be burning

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.580 
4,800 a week and you're gonna be burning
fat<00:02:32.250> at<00:02:32.489> an<00:02:32.610> exponential<00:02:33.120> rate<00:02:33.299> now<00:02:34.049> I<00:02:34.409> do

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
fat at an exponential rate now I do

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.890 
fat at an exponential rate now I do
think<00:02:34.709> it's<00:02:35.040> ok<00:02:35.310> to<00:02:35.340> take<00:02:35.670> an<00:02:35.849> extra<00:02:36.060> 3<00:02:36.360> to<00:02:36.480> 500

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
think it's ok to take an extra 3 to 500

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.110 
think it's ok to take an extra 3 to 500
calories<00:02:37.049> a<00:02:37.379> day<00:02:37.500> maybe<00:02:38.129> add<00:02:38.370> that<00:02:38.579> on<00:02:38.700> top<00:02:38.879> of

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
calories a day maybe add that on top of

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.339 
calories a day maybe add that on top of
what<00:02:39.269> you're<00:02:39.360> already<00:02:39.480> eating<00:02:39.659> the<00:02:39.959> other<00:02:40.079> 5

00:02:40.339 --> 00:02:40.349 
what you're already eating the other 5

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:41.839 
what you're already eating the other 5
days<00:02:40.560> of<00:02:40.709> the<00:02:40.799> week<00:02:40.950> I<00:02:41.190> don't<00:02:41.400> think<00:02:41.730> it's

00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:41.849 
days of the week I don't think it's

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:43.250 
days of the week I don't think it's
gonna<00:02:41.940> slow<00:02:42.209> down<00:02:42.239> your<00:02:42.540> fat<00:02:42.720> loss<00:02:42.930> at<00:02:43.170> all

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
gonna slow down your fat loss at all

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.619 
gonna slow down your fat loss at all
because<00:02:43.650> for<00:02:44.250> it<00:02:44.310> to<00:02:44.430> do<00:02:44.579> that<00:02:44.609> you<00:02:45.390> would<00:02:45.510> have

00:02:45.619 --> 00:02:45.629 
because for it to do that you would have

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:47.180 
because for it to do that you would have
to<00:02:45.780> completely<00:02:46.260> discount<00:02:46.680> the<00:02:46.829> fact<00:02:47.069> that

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
to completely discount the fact that

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.039
