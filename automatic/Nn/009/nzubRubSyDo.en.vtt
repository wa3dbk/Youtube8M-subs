the solution to puzzle one is first

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:20.720 
the solution to puzzle one is first
Bishop<00:00:18.030> g5<00:00:18.360> double<00:00:19.290> check<00:00:19.500> and<00:00:19.740> keep<00:00:20.400> in<00:00:20.550> mind

Bishop g5 double check and keep in mind
from<00:00:20.850> the<00:00:21.030> original<00:00:21.390> position<00:00:21.780> white<00:00:22.050> is

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
from the original position white is

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.290 
from the original position white is
already<00:00:22.470> down<00:00:22.620> a<00:00:22.650> queen<00:00:22.980> and<00:00:23.190> so<00:00:23.790> attempts<00:00:24.180> are

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
already down a queen and so attempts are

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.760 
already down a queen and so attempts are
trying<00:00:24.540> to<00:00:24.600> go<00:00:24.720> after<00:00:24.870> the<00:00:25.080> black<00:00:25.260> queen<00:00:25.560> are

and if the King tries to go to c7 we
once<00:00:40.560> again<00:00:40.650> make<00:00:40.950> use<00:00:41.130> of<00:00:41.160> d8<00:00:41.579> only<00:00:42.090> this<00:00:42.210> time

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
once again make use of d8 only this time

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.360 
once again make use of d8 only this time
with<00:00:42.600> the<00:00:42.690> bishop<00:00:43.050> so<00:00:43.620> that<00:00:43.770> the<00:00:43.890> King<00:00:44.070> cannot

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
with the bishop so that the King cannot

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.810 
with the bishop so that the King cannot
run<00:00:44.610> to<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:45.510> b6<00:00:45.930> square<00:00:46.020> so<00:00:46.829> this<00:00:47.430> first

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
run to the b6 square so this first

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.310 
run to the b6 square so this first
puzzle<00:00:48.210> was<00:00:48.300> actually<00:00:48.690> a<00:00:48.720> checkmate<00:00:49.110> in<00:00:49.260> two

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
puzzle was actually a checkmate in two

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.380 
puzzle was actually a checkmate in two
and<00:00:50.310> so<00:00:50.579> moving<00:00:50.940> on<00:00:51.060> now<00:00:51.270> to<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:52.170> next<00:00:52.380> one

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:53.390 
and so moving on now to the next one

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:56.090 
and so moving on now to the next one
white<00:00:54.390> to<00:00:54.540> play<00:00:54.720> pause<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:55.320> video<00:00:55.530> see<00:00:55.980> if<00:00:56.010> you

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
white to play pause the video see if you

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.180 
white to play pause the video see if you
can<00:00:56.220> find<00:00:56.399> the<00:00:56.489> best<00:00:56.579> continuation<00:00:57.980> ok<00:00:58.980> the

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
can find the best continuation ok the

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.130 
can find the best continuation ok the
solution<00:00:59.520> to<00:00:59.579> this<00:00:59.700> one<00:00:59.940> is<00:01:00.600> not<00:01:00.960> to

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
solution to this one is not to

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.110 
solution to this one is not to
immediately<00:01:01.500> take<00:01:01.770> the<00:01:01.920> pawn<00:01:02.130> taking<00:01:03.059> the

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
immediately take the pawn taking the

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.819 
immediately take the pawn taking the
pawn<00:01:03.300> to<00:01:03.420> give<00:01:03.540> check<00:01:03.840> while<00:01:04.469> it<00:01:04.649> might<00:01:04.769> be

00:01:04.819 --> 00:01:04.829 
pawn to give check while it might be

00:01:04.829 --> 00:01:06.860 
pawn to give check while it might be
very<00:01:05.159> appealing<00:01:05.430> since<00:01:06.119> the<00:01:06.240> king<00:01:06.420> is<00:01:06.570> already

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:06.870 
very appealing since the king is already

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:08.539 
very appealing since the king is already
running<00:01:07.080> very<00:01:07.409> short<00:01:07.470> on<00:01:07.799> squares<00:01:08.100> the<00:01:08.370> knight

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
running very short on squares the knight

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.360 
running very short on squares the knight
is<00:01:08.700> there<00:01:08.850> to<00:01:09.000> defend<00:01:09.270> however<00:01:10.280> once<00:01:11.280> you

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:11.370 
is there to defend however once you

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:13.039 
is there to defend however once you
recognize<00:01:11.580> this<00:01:12.060> maybe<00:01:12.479> you<00:01:12.630> can<00:01:12.840> first

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
recognize this maybe you can first

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.200 
recognize this maybe you can first
remove<00:01:13.530> the<00:01:13.650> defender<00:01:14.070> Queen<00:01:14.850> takes<00:01:15.030> Knight

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
remove the defender Queen takes Knight

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.210 
remove the defender Queen takes Knight
is<00:01:15.479> the<00:01:15.630> best<00:01:15.810> move<00:01:16.049> delivering<00:01:16.650> check<00:01:16.920> if<00:01:17.070> the

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
is the best move delivering check if the

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.370 
is the best move delivering check if the
King<00:01:17.370> tries<00:01:17.610> to<00:01:17.820> run<00:01:18.000> the<00:01:18.659> bishop<00:01:18.960> grabs<00:01:19.170> the

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
King tries to run the bishop grabs the

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.500 
King tries to run the bishop grabs the
pond<00:01:19.530> and<00:01:19.770> that<00:01:19.799> will<00:01:20.040> be<00:01:20.159> main<00:01:20.369> the<00:01:21.299> only

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:21.510 
pond and that will be main the only

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:23.060 
pond and that will be main the only
other<00:01:21.659> thing<00:01:21.900> to<00:01:21.930> do<00:01:22.229> is<00:01:22.409> to<00:01:22.560> take<00:01:22.740> the<00:01:22.860> Queen

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
other thing to do is to take the Queen

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.219 
other thing to do is to take the Queen
and<00:01:23.310> now<00:01:23.460> only<00:01:23.820> at<00:01:24.060> this<00:01:24.240> point<00:01:24.540> do<00:01:25.110> the

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
and now only at this point do the

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.219 
and now only at this point do the
bishops<00:01:25.590> now<00:01:26.330> control<00:01:27.330> all<00:01:27.570> of<00:01:27.720> these<00:01:27.869> squares

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
bishops now control all of these squares

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:29.870 
bishops now control all of these squares
and<00:01:28.409> this<00:01:28.560> is<00:01:28.680> checkmate<00:01:28.920> so<00:01:29.520> once<00:01:29.729> again

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
and this is checkmate so once again

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.929 
and this is checkmate so once again
another<00:01:30.630> checkmate<00:01:31.170> in<00:01:31.290> two<00:01:31.439> puzzle<00:01:31.939> moving

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
another checkmate in two puzzle moving

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:36.260 
another checkmate in two puzzle moving
on<00:01:33.060> to<00:01:33.210> the<00:01:33.299> third<00:01:33.479> one<00:01:34.460> white<00:01:35.460> to<00:01:35.610> play<00:01:35.790> pause

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
on to the third one white to play pause

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:37.580 
on to the third one white to play pause
the<00:01:36.510> video<00:01:36.750> see<00:01:36.960> if<00:01:36.990> you<00:01:37.080> can<00:01:37.200> find<00:01:37.380> the<00:01:37.470> best

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
the video see if you can find the best

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.850 
the video see if you can find the best
continuation<00:01:38.900> ok<00:01:39.900> the<00:01:40.080> solution<00:01:40.439> to<00:01:40.500> this<00:01:40.619> one

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
continuation ok the solution to this one

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.200 
continuation ok the solution to this one
is<00:01:41.790> first<00:01:42.090> between<00:01:43.049> the<00:01:43.229> f8<00:01:43.880> and<00:01:44.880> there<00:01:45.119> is

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
is first between the f8 and there is

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.780 
is first between the f8 and there is
only<00:01:45.360> one<00:01:45.450> reply<00:01:45.900> but<00:01:46.860> ship<00:01:47.009> takes<00:01:47.250> Queen<00:01:47.490> and

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
only one reply but ship takes Queen and

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.440 
only one reply but ship takes Queen and
now<00:01:48.570> finishing<00:01:48.990> up<00:01:49.310> Knight<00:01:50.310> g7<00:01:50.880> and<00:01:51.030> this<00:01:51.299> is

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
now finishing up Knight g7 and this is

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.690 
now finishing up Knight g7 and this is
checkmate<00:01:51.689> since<00:01:52.140> both<00:01:52.350> rook<00:01:52.650> and<00:01:52.890> Knight<00:01:53.220> are

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
checkmate since both rook and Knight are

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.730 
checkmate since both rook and Knight are
hitting<00:01:54.000> the<00:01:54.090> King<00:01:54.299> once<00:01:54.659> again<00:01:54.990> double<00:01:55.530> check

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
hitting the King once again double check

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.429 
hitting the King once again double check
and<00:01:55.979> there's<00:01:56.939> no<00:01:57.180> place<00:01:57.930> that<00:01:58.140> the<00:01:58.259> King<00:01:58.409> can

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
and there's no place that the King can

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.530 
and there's no place that the King can
run<00:01:58.710> to<00:01:58.829> that<00:01:59.009> is<00:01:59.159> safe<00:01:59.369> so<00:01:59.820> these<00:02:00.000> first<00:02:00.210> three

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
run to that is safe so these first three

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.950 
run to that is safe so these first three
so<00:02:00.840> far<00:02:01.140> we're<00:02:01.860> checkmate<00:02:02.189> in<00:02:02.369> two<00:02:02.490> puzzles

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:02.960 
so far we're checkmate in two puzzles

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:07.160 
so far we're checkmate in two puzzles

to blunt this diagonal with that five

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:31.250 
to blunt this diagonal with that five
that<00:02:28.650> would<00:02:28.800> drop<00:02:28.950> the<00:02:29.130> Queen<00:02:29.510> and<00:02:30.510> this<00:02:31.080> is

else<00:02:33.030> well<00:02:33.540> we're<00:02:33.810> just<00:02:33.840> going<00:02:34.170> to<00:02:34.230> be<00:02:34.380> mating

else well we're just going to be mating
on<00:02:35.160> each<00:02:35.490> seven<00:02:35.910> so<00:02:36.120> this<00:02:36.330> is<00:02:36.510> turning<00:02:36.870> out<00:02:37.050> to

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
on each seven so this is turning out to

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.040 
on each seven so this is turning out to
be<00:02:37.760> maybe<00:02:38.760> the<00:02:38.940> best<00:02:39.120> move<00:02:39.390> at<00:02:39.540> this<00:02:39.630> point<00:02:39.750> I

be maybe the best move at this point I

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:41.720 
be maybe the best move at this point I
guess<00:02:40.230> there's<00:02:40.470> some<00:02:40.530> sacrifices<00:02:41.220> to<00:02:41.520> delay

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
play pause the video see if you can find

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.820 
play pause the video see if you can find
the<00:03:22.350> best<00:03:22.470> continuation<00:03:24.320> okay<00:03:25.350> the<00:03:25.470> solution

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:25.830 
the best continuation okay the solution

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:29.210 
the best continuation okay the solution
to<00:03:25.860> this<00:03:26.040> last<00:03:26.340> one<00:03:26.640> is<00:03:27.590> King<00:03:28.590> in<00:03:28.709> the<00:03:28.799> corner

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
to this last one is King in the corner

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:32.990 
to this last one is King in the corner
and<00:03:30.650> the<00:03:31.650> idea<00:03:31.950> here<00:03:32.220> is<00:03:32.310> that<00:03:32.340> if<00:03:32.610> now<00:03:32.730> Queen

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
and the idea here is that if now Queen

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.850 
and the idea here is that if now Queen
takes<00:03:33.150> bishop<00:03:33.570> this<00:03:33.750> is<00:03:33.900> actually<00:03:34.260> stalemate

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:34.860 
takes bishop this is actually stalemate

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:36.860 
takes bishop this is actually stalemate
so<00:03:35.580> of<00:03:35.640> course<00:03:35.820> important<00:03:36.330> to<00:03:36.420> recognize<00:03:36.840> that

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
so of course important to recognize that

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:39.680 
so of course important to recognize that
there<00:03:37.380> is<00:03:37.580> not<00:03:38.580> a<00:03:38.610> way<00:03:38.850> for<00:03:39.150> white<00:03:39.269> to<00:03:39.450> win<00:03:39.600> this

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
there is not a way for white to win this

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:42.050 
there is not a way for white to win this
position<00:03:40.170> taking<00:03:40.590> the<00:03:40.680> Queen<00:03:40.860> well<00:03:41.519> the<00:03:41.880> King

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:45.199 
position taking the Queen well the King
is<00:03:42.180> of<00:03:42.360> course<00:03:42.600> too<00:03:43.500> far<00:03:43.769> away<00:03:43.950> this<00:03:44.790> is<00:03:45.000> just

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209 
is of course too far away this is just

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:46.580 
is of course too far away this is just
completely<00:03:45.540> waiting<00:03:45.870> for<00:03:45.989> black<00:03:46.170> so<00:03:46.380> you<00:03:46.410> have

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
completely waiting for black so you have

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:48.979 
completely waiting for black so you have
to<00:03:46.709> make<00:03:46.830> use<00:03:47.040> of<00:03:47.070> a<00:03:47.280> stalemate<00:03:47.549> idea<00:03:48.540> King<00:03:48.870> to

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:48.989 
to make use of a stalemate idea King to

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:52.250 
to make use of a stalemate idea King to
h1<00:03:49.470> and<00:03:49.739> any<00:03:50.700> other<00:03:50.910> black<00:03:51.239> King<00:03:51.570> move<00:03:51.780> while

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
h1 and any other black King move while

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:53.870 
h1 and any other black King move while
you're<00:03:52.530> just<00:03:52.650> dropping<00:03:52.860> the<00:03:53.130> Queen<00:03:53.370> so<00:03:53.549> this

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:53.880 
you're just dropping the Queen so this

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:56.300 
you're just dropping the Queen so this
is<00:03:54.030> really<00:03:54.330> going<00:03:54.989> to<00:03:55.170> be<00:03:55.260> the<00:03:55.380> best<00:03:55.620> play<00:03:56.010> for

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
is really going to be the best play for

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:59.000 
is really going to be the best play for
black<00:03:56.489> at<00:03:56.730> that<00:03:56.760> point<00:03:57.180> and<00:03:58.019> I<00:03:58.230> guess<00:03:58.290> as<00:03:58.620> a

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 
black at that point and I guess as a

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:02.900 
black at that point and I guess as a
bonus<00:03:59.580> question<00:04:00.299> if<00:04:00.630> there<00:04:00.989> is<00:04:01.610> some<00:04:02.610> time<00:04:02.790> it

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:02.910 
bonus question if there is some time it

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:04.640 
bonus question if there is some time it
was<00:04:03.209> some<00:04:03.480> type<00:04:03.660> of<00:04:03.690> a<00:04:03.870> bonus<00:04:04.170> question<00:04:04.500> that<00:04:04.620> I

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
was some type of a bonus question that I

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:06.590 
was some type of a bonus question that I
could<00:04:04.739> be<00:04:04.890> throwing<00:04:05.100> out<00:04:05.310> at<00:04:05.459> this<00:04:05.549> point<00:04:05.880> if

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:06.600 
could be throwing out at this point if

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:09.080 
could be throwing out at this point if
I'm<00:04:06.840> to<00:04:07.019> ask<00:04:07.170> you<00:04:07.530> if<00:04:07.769> black<00:04:08.310> does<00:04:08.580> not<00:04:08.760> capture

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090 
I'm to ask you if black does not capture

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:12.400 
I'm to ask you if black does not capture
the<00:04:09.299> bishop<00:04:09.830> does<00:04:10.830> black<00:04:11.220> lose<00:04:11.760> this<00:04:11.940> position

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:12.410 
the bishop does black lose this position

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:15.140 
the bishop does black lose this position
yes<00:04:13.410> or<00:04:13.620> no<00:04:13.769> if<00:04:14.370> you'd<00:04:14.519> like<00:04:14.670> to<00:04:14.820> pause<00:04:15.000> the

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.150 
yes or no if you'd like to pause the

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:16.340 
yes or no if you'd like to pause the
video<00:04:15.390> and<00:04:15.540> think<00:04:15.600> about<00:04:15.810> it<00:04:16.079> for<00:04:16.169> a<00:04:16.229> little

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:16.350 
video and think about it for a little

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:20.090 
video and think about it for a little
bit<00:04:16.560> and<00:04:16.950> I'll<00:04:17.130> just<00:04:17.370> give<00:04:17.700> the<00:04:17.820> answer<00:04:19.100> okay

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:20.100 
bit and I'll just give the answer okay

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:22.039 
bit and I'll just give the answer okay
if<00:04:20.519> black<00:04:20.790> does<00:04:21.000> not<00:04:21.209> capture<00:04:21.630> the<00:04:21.660> bishop

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049 
if black does not capture the bishop

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:24.650 
if black does not capture the bishop
black<00:04:22.380> still<00:04:22.710> does<00:04:23.190> not<00:04:23.370> lose<00:04:23.640> for<00:04:24.210> example<00:04:24.570> if

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:24.660 
black still does not lose for example if

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:26.770 
black still does not lose for example if
the<00:04:24.750> King<00:04:24.930> goes<00:04:25.140> to<00:04:25.530> any<00:04:25.830> one<00:04:26.039> of<00:04:26.070> these<00:04:26.250> three

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:26.780 
the King goes to any one of these three

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:30.230 
the King goes to any one of these three
let's<00:04:27.780> just<00:04:27.990> say<00:04:28.110> here<00:04:28.410> bishop<00:04:29.370> takes

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:30.240 
let's just say here bishop takes

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:33.260 
let's just say here bishop takes
this<00:04:30.750> is<00:04:30.900> not<00:04:31.110> a<00:04:31.140> win<00:04:31.410> for<00:04:31.650> white<00:04:31.830> because<00:04:32.730> if

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:33.270 
this is not a win for white because if

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:34.760 
this is not a win for white because if
you<00:04:33.420> can<00:04:33.570> envision<00:04:33.810> this<00:04:34.110> pawn<00:04:34.320> is<00:04:34.500> already

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:34.770 
you can envision this pawn is already

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:37.880 
you can envision this pawn is already
being<00:04:34.980> passed<00:04:35.960> that<00:04:36.960> queening<00:04:37.410> square<00:04:37.680> is<00:04:37.860> a

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:37.890 
being passed that queening square is a

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:39.830 
being passed that queening square is a
light<00:04:38.160> square<00:04:38.490> the<00:04:38.910> bishop<00:04:39.240> needs<00:04:39.450> to<00:04:39.630> be<00:04:39.750> able

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:39.840 
light square the bishop needs to be able

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:41.510 
light square the bishop needs to be able
to<00:04:40.050> control<00:04:40.380> it<00:04:40.560> and<00:04:40.710> because<00:04:41.040> he<00:04:41.220> does<00:04:41.370> not

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:41.520 
to control it and because he does not

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.030 
to control it and because he does not
there's<00:04:41.850> not<00:04:42.000> a<00:04:42.030> way<00:04:42.180> to<00:04:42.240> push<00:04:42.600> this<00:04:42.780> pawn

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:43.040 
there's not a way to push this pawn

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:46.640 
there's not a way to push this pawn
eventually<00:04:44.040> to<00:04:44.190> to<00:04:44.400> Queen<00:04:44.670> and<00:04:45.300> so<00:04:46.140> you<00:04:46.560> know

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:46.650 
eventually to to Queen and so you know

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:48.320 
eventually to to Queen and so you know
white<00:04:46.890> wouldn't<00:04:47.190> be<00:04:47.250> able<00:04:47.310> to<00:04:47.490> win<00:04:47.730> from<00:04:48.180> this

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:48.330 
white wouldn't be able to win from this

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:50.660 
white wouldn't be able to win from this
position<00:04:48.540> but<00:04:48.960> nevertheless<00:04:49.680> you<00:04:50.400> wouldn't

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:50.670 
position but nevertheless you wouldn't

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:51.980 
position but nevertheless you wouldn't
see<00:04:50.820> that<00:04:50.850> type<00:04:51.210> of<00:04:51.240> a<00:04:51.420> thing<00:04:51.450> from<00:04:51.810> this

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:51.990 
see that type of a thing from this

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:53.990 
see that type of a thing from this
position<00:04:52.200> King<00:04:53.190> Navy<00:04:53.400> which<00:04:53.490> one<00:04:53.670> is<00:04:53.880> the

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:54.000 
position King Navy which one is the

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.140 
position King Navy which one is the
solution<00:04:54.270> and<00:04:55.070> we<00:04:56.070> just<00:04:56.400> end<00:04:56.580> up<00:04:56.700> in<00:04:56.820> a<00:04:56.940> drawn

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:57.150 
solution and we just end up in a drawn

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:59.420 
solution and we just end up in a drawn
position<00:04:57.600> after<00:04:57.720> Queen<00:04:58.080> takes<00:04:58.260> bishop<00:04:58.650> so

00:04:59.420 --> 00:04:59.430 
position after Queen takes bishop so

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:01.250 
position after Queen takes bishop so
