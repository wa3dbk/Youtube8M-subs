00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
this isn't really a game whoa this isn't

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.740 
this isn't really a game whoa this isn't
really<00:01:29.100> a<00:01:29.250> gamebreaking<00:01:29.759> glitch<00:01:29.909> but<00:01:30.600> it's

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
really a gamebreaking glitch but it's

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.149 
really a gamebreaking glitch but it's
just<00:01:30.869> one<00:01:30.960> of<00:01:31.020> those<00:01:31.140> ones<00:01:31.470> that<00:01:31.590> helps<00:01:31.950> you

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
just one of those ones that helps you

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.490 
just one of those ones that helps you
get<00:01:32.610> it<00:01:32.790> faster<00:01:33.420> than<00:01:33.540> normal<00:01:33.720> so<00:01:34.140> I'm<00:01:34.380> not

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
get it faster than normal so I'm not

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.080 
get it faster than normal so I'm not
going<00:01:34.680> to<00:01:34.740> put<00:01:34.860> fast<00:01:35.130> in<00:01:35.400> the<00:01:35.490> title<00:01:35.850> because

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
going to put fast in the title because

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.030 
going to put fast in the title because
it's<00:01:36.270> not<00:01:36.390> fast<00:01:36.689> it<00:01:37.350> does<00:01:37.560> take<00:01:37.799> a<00:01:37.829> little

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
it's not fast it does take a little

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.850 
it's not fast it does take a little
while<00:01:38.340> so<00:01:39.000> if<00:01:39.210> you're<00:01:39.360> looking<00:01:39.540> to<00:01:39.869> make<00:01:40.259> your

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
while so if you're looking to make your

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.289 
while so if you're looking to make your
strength<00:01:41.189> even<00:01:41.490> better<00:01:41.759> than<00:01:41.970> what<00:01:42.150> it<00:01:42.180> was

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
strength even better than what it was

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.480 
strength even better than what it was
then<00:01:42.960> just<00:01:43.259> do<00:01:43.470> this<00:01:43.619> method<00:01:44.009> as<00:01:44.130> you<00:01:44.220> see<00:01:44.399> at

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
then just do this method as you see at

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.130 
then just do this method as you see at
the<00:01:44.520> bottom<00:01:44.729> left<00:01:45.000> of<00:01:45.119> the<00:01:45.180> screen<00:01:45.270> it<00:01:45.720> will

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
the bottom left of the screen it will

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.109 
the bottom left of the screen it will
pop<00:01:46.380> up<00:01:46.409> any<00:01:46.740> second<00:01:47.189> now<00:01:47.220> saying<00:01:47.909> your

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
pop up any second now saying your

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:49.969 
pop up any second now saying your
strength<00:01:48.390> has<00:01:48.540> went<00:01:48.750> up<00:01:48.869> to<00:01:49.079> think<00:01:49.590> of<00:01:49.740> eighty

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
strength has went up to think of eighty

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.770 
strength has went up to think of eighty
percent<00:01:50.250> I'm<00:01:50.579> not<00:01:50.670> assurance<00:01:51.030> at<00:01:51.119> 60<00:01:51.420> 80<00:01:51.570> I

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
percent I'm not assurance at 60 80 I

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.929 
percent I'm not assurance at 60 80 I
don't<00:01:51.960> know<00:01:52.049> you<00:01:52.290> have<00:01:52.439> a<00:01:52.470> look<00:01:52.680> cuz<00:01:52.950> I<00:01:53.070> I<00:01:53.369> got<00:01:53.909> a

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
brain like a fucking goldfish so they go

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.209 
brain like a fucking goldfish so they go
up<00:01:56.820> to<00:01:56.880> 80<00:01:57.360> out<00:01:57.600> of<00:01:57.630> 100<00:01:57.899> it's<00:01:58.829> a<00:01:58.920> very<00:01:59.130> easy

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
up to 80 out of 100 it's a very easy

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:02.090 
up to 80 out of 100 it's a very easy
thing<00:01:59.520> to<00:01:59.880> do<00:02:00.030> it's<00:02:00.600> not<00:02:00.810> very<00:02:01.110> very<00:02:01.530> effective

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
thing to do it's not very very effective

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.770 
thing to do it's not very very effective
but<00:02:02.280> it<00:02:02.369> does<00:02:02.549> help<00:02:02.759> you<00:02:03.030> if<00:02:03.180> you're<00:02:03.329> looking

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
to rain cut the next part of this is if

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.990 
to rain cut the next part of this is if
you<00:02:06.780> want<00:02:06.960> to<00:02:07.079> rank<00:02:07.560> up<00:02:07.770> your<00:02:08.129> shooting<00:02:08.759> and

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
just get a gun out I've decided to use

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.200 
just get a gun out I've decided to use
the<00:02:10.830> Gatling<00:02:11.280> gun<00:02:11.459> because<00:02:11.730> the

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:12.210 
the Gatling gun because the

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:13.580 
the Gatling gun because the
you<00:02:12.300> don't<00:02:12.480> have<00:02:12.570> to<00:02:12.690> reload<00:02:13.050> it's<00:02:13.380> just

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
you don't have to reload it's just

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.320 
you don't have to reload it's just
convenient<00:02:13.950> so<00:02:14.520> this<00:02:14.670> is<00:02:14.820> a<00:02:14.850> part<00:02:15.120> where<00:02:15.270> you

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
convenient so this is a part where you

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:16.760 
convenient so this is a part where you
will<00:02:15.480> get<00:02:15.630> police<00:02:15.870> on<00:02:16.080> you<00:02:16.260> won't<00:02:16.410> get<00:02:16.590> these

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
will get police on you won't get these

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:18.500 
will get police on you won't get these
from<00:02:16.920> you<00:02:17.070> for<00:02:17.250> the<00:02:17.310> other<00:02:17.400> part<00:02:17.730> but<00:02:18.210> you<00:02:18.360> want

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
from you for the other part but you want

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.240 
from you for the other part but you want
to<00:02:18.600> aim<00:02:18.750> to<00:02:18.990> the<00:02:19.080> head<00:02:19.290> and<00:02:19.440> just<00:02:20.010> keep

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250
