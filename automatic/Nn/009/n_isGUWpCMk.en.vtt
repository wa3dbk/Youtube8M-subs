00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:07.960
 we are about to finish 2013 a year 

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:10.119
 that has left us many surprises with 

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:12.129
 regarding mobile phones and tablets 

00:00:10.119 --> 00:00:14.709
 undoubtedly the protagonists of the party 

00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:16.840
 there are practically days left to change 

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:18.730
 of year and there's still nothing firm that 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:22.210
 go ahead in what we can expect 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:24.580
 in 2014 the only thing we have is data 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:26.740
 from alleged rumors 

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:29.470
 leaks and the odd model 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:30.430
 shown with a very different concept to 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:33.309
 seen so far 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:35.469
 eye to the Chinese market because it certainly goes 

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:37.780
 to hit very hard in the West and 

00:00:35.469 --> 00:00:40.089
 we will be very aware of the possible 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:42.489
 competitors that appear in that area 

00:00:40.089 --> 00:00:44.559
 however we can foresee some of 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:47.319
 those that will be top sales for their 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:49.329
 trajectory in the previous ones so 

00:00:47.319 --> 00:00:51.730
 we go there with the candidates who 

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:54.640
 we have at the moment 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:56.290
 despite having been announced already this 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:59.860
 model will not be marketed in europe 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:02.680
 until 2014 the particular thing that the 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:04.449
 sheik flex is its curved design the 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:06.670
 investigation by the axis about 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:08.650
 the flexible screens has led to 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:11.470
 manufacturer to create this first 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:13.960
 approaching the gef lex is a phone 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:16.420
 striking with a format designed to 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:18.580
 offer ergonomics when talking and 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:20.740
 in some movie screens at the time 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:23.350
 to watch videos or movies from the 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:25.240
 own terminal maybe your hardware 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:28.119
 does not exceed by far the 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:30.100
 large terminals of 2013 but only by 

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:32.680
 the innovation that contributes to the sector and 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:37.259
 deserves to be one of the antÃ³n candidates 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:37.259
 of the best mobiles of 2014 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:41.799
 and the samsung brand has reached a level 

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:44.020
 of popularity that leads directly 

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:46.540
 to the top positions in almost any 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:48.600
 top that is done at the moment we have are 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:51.280
 many rumors and alleged leaks 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:55.090
 about what the samsung galaxy s 5 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:57.039
 will contribute to the market in 2014 and knowing 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:59.289
 the manufacturer sure he gets his 

00:01:57.039 --> 00:02:02.259
 placed among the top 3 without further 

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:04.869
 difficulty what the galaxy s would bring 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:08.560
 5 to this market would be a processor of 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:11.230
 48 64-bit cores over 3 gb of ram 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:13.510
 and as the experts say possibly 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.880
 it would also bring a design 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:18.760
 curved in the absence of knowing new 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:22.860
 rivals this would be among the best 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:25.230
 2014 mobile no doubt 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:28.350
 the third candidate from our list of 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:30.450
 best mobiles for 2014 is the iphone 6 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:32.520
 as in the case of samsung that the 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.830
 commercial trajectory of the brand 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:37.410
 it becomes almost a season pass 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:40.590
 so it will almost certainly be finally 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:42.780
 in the top real what is said about this 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:45.240
 iphone 6 is that it equates a crystal of 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:48.660
 sapphire instead of the typical corning 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:50.540
 gorilla glass in fact is up to 25 times 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:53.280
 more resistant to bumps and scratches 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:55.680
 it is also said that apple would combine the 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:58.800
 2 haiti with a recognition sensor 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:01.230
 facial for safety issues other 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:04.200
 aspect that would improve would be the ranc 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:06.660
 thanks to the 64-bit processor the 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:09.870
 coming iphone 6 could increase this 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:13.050
 up to 4 gb getting more fluency and 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:15.300
 more power to process data and here 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:17.430
 are these guys are our three 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:20.160
 candidates to be the best mobiles 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:22.110
 for 2014 it is clear that we will have to 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.640
 go updating this information to 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:25.709
 incorporate both the ads 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:27.390
 officers that are given as the 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:30.040
 new rumors that are appearing 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:32.379
 but this is the most palpable 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:35.560
 to know what will be next 

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:38.670
 year and you which one would you add to this list 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.670
 according to the known
