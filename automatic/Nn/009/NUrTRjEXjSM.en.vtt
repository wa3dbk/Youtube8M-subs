this<00:03:37.380> character<00:03:37.830> and<00:03:37.920> knows<00:03:38.160> he's<00:03:38.310> going<00:03:38.550> to

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
this character and knows he's going to

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:40.340 
this character and knows he's going to
die<00:03:38.850> and<00:03:39.120> in<00:03:39.330> both<00:03:39.510> of<00:03:39.660> these<00:03:39.750> moments<00:03:40.200> he's

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:40.350 
die and in both of these moments he's

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:42.110 
die and in both of these moments he's
accepting<00:03:40.920> that<00:03:41.040> and<00:03:41.280> continuing<00:03:41.730> the<00:03:41.940> fight

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
accepting that and continuing the fight

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.030 
accepting that and continuing the fight
and<00:03:42.840> I<00:03:42.960> think<00:03:43.140> this<00:03:43.230> is<00:03:43.350> a<00:03:43.380> great<00:03:43.560> example<00:03:43.980> of

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
and I think this is a great example of

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.070 
and I think this is a great example of
using<00:03:44.220> sound<00:03:44.610> as<00:03:44.910> an<00:03:45.060> overall<00:03:45.420> cinematic

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:46.080 
using sound as an overall cinematic

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:49.020 
structure for the whole film I do want

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:50.360 
structure for the whole film I do want
to<00:03:49.050> point<00:03:49.230> out<00:03:49.350> this<00:03:49.590> stuff<00:03:49.830> isn't<00:03:50.010> just<00:03:50.310> a

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
to point out this stuff isn't just a

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:52.040 
to point out this stuff isn't just a
matter<00:03:50.610> of<00:03:50.730> good<00:03:50.970> sound<00:03:51.390> mixing<00:03:51.780> though<00:03:51.900> there

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:52.050 
matter of good sound mixing though there

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:53.990 
matter of good sound mixing though there
is<00:03:52.170> that<00:03:52.380> the<00:03:52.830> sound<00:03:53.070> mixers<00:03:53.340> can't<00:03:53.610> do<00:03:53.820> this

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
is that the sound mixers can't do this

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.430 
is that the sound mixers can't do this
stuff<00:03:54.210> if<00:03:54.420> you<00:03:54.540> design<00:03:54.870> the<00:03:55.050> movie<00:03:55.260> with

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440 
stuff if you design the movie with

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:57.830 
stuff if you design the movie with
wall-to-wall<00:03:55.770> dialogue<00:03:56.580> effects<00:03:56.940> of<00:03:57.090> music<00:03:57.510> I

wall-to-wall dialogue effects of music I
don't<00:03:58.260> have<00:03:58.530> anything<00:03:58.740> against<00:03:59.730> a<00:04:00.630> film<00:04:01.380> being

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 
don't have anything against a film being

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.130 
don't have anything against a film being
loud<00:04:01.950> for<00:04:02.490> a<00:04:02.520> moment<00:04:03.060> or<00:04:03.180> two<00:04:03.210> or<00:04:03.780> a<00:04:03.810> short

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:04.140 
loud for a moment or two or a short

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:05.750 
loud for a moment or two or a short
period<00:04:04.440> of<00:04:04.590> time<00:04:04.650> I<00:04:04.890> think<00:04:05.400> that's<00:04:05.580> completely

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 
period of time I think that's completely

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.540 
period of time I think that's completely
appropriate<00:04:06.860> but<00:04:07.860> if<00:04:07.950> you<00:04:08.070> have<00:04:08.250> a<00:04:08.280> sequence

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:08.550 
appropriate but if you have a sequence

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:11.810 
appropriate but if you have a sequence
that's<00:04:08.970> loud<00:04:09.210> for<00:04:09.720> 20<00:04:10.170> or<00:04:10.200> 30<00:04:10.320> minutes<00:04:10.820> you've

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:11.820 
that's loud for 20 or 30 minutes you've

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:14.330 
that's loud for 20 or 30 minutes you've
forgotten<00:04:12.240> what<00:04:12.780> it's<00:04:12.900> like<00:04:13.140> to<00:04:13.410> be<00:04:13.440> quiet<00:04:13.890> and

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.340 
forgotten what it's like to be quiet and

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:17.330 
forgotten what it's like to be quiet and
so<00:04:14.610> nothing<00:04:15.510> really<00:04:15.720> seems<00:04:16.290> loud<00:04:16.650> because

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:17.340 
so nothing really seems loud because

so nothing really seems loud because

they're feeling and you get something
