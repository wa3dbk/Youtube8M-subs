not<00:00:29.519> outfit<00:00:30.029> so<00:00:30.750> the<00:00:31.080> o2<00:00:31.289> capacity<00:00:32.099> and<00:00:32.189> the

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
not outfit so the o2 capacity and the

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.340 
not outfit so the o2 capacity and the
max<00:00:32.489> slam<00:00:32.790> damage<00:00:33.270> are<00:00:33.390> pretty<00:00:33.570> decent<00:00:34.110> with

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
max slam damage are pretty decent with

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.860 
max slam damage are pretty decent with
this<00:00:34.590> oz<00:00:34.800> kit<00:00:35.219> the<00:00:35.820> maximum<00:00:36.090> damage<00:00:36.480> adds

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
this oz kit the maximum damage adds

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.680 
this oz kit the maximum damage adds
corrosion<00:00:37.680> that's<00:00:38.010> pretty<00:00:38.280> cool<00:00:38.690> interesting

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
corrosion that's pretty cool interesting

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.299 
corrosion that's pretty cool interesting
thing<00:00:39.899> about<00:00:39.930> it<00:00:40.230> though<00:00:40.350> is<00:00:40.379> the<00:00:40.649> fire<00:00:40.980> rate

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
thing about it though is the fire rate

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.490 
thing about it though is the fire rate
stacking<00:00:41.969> and<00:00:42.120> the<00:00:42.450> reload<00:00:42.809> speed<00:00:43.050> stacking

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
stacking and the reload speed stacking

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.920 
stacking and the reload speed stacking
when<00:00:44.370> you're<00:00:44.579> shooting<00:00:44.789> an<00:00:45.059> airborne<00:00:45.480> target

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
when you're shooting an airborne target

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.889 
when you're shooting an airborne target
this<00:00:46.500> can<00:00:46.739> definitely<00:00:47.489> come<00:00:47.850> in<00:00:47.879> handy<00:00:48.090> when

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
this can definitely come in handy when

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.750 
this can definitely come in handy when
you're<00:00:49.110> shooting<00:00:49.649> some<00:00:49.980> of<00:00:50.100> those<00:00:50.250> flying

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
you're shooting some of those flying

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.880 
you're shooting some of those flying
machines<00:00:50.879> out<00:00:51.449> there<00:00:51.480> or<00:00:51.960> when<00:00:52.289> your<00:00:52.440> enemies

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
machines out there or when your enemies

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.939 
machines out there or when your enemies
are<00:00:52.920> jumping<00:00:53.579> around<00:00:53.699> pretty<00:00:54.629> cool<00:00:54.899> now<00:00:55.590> first

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
are jumping around pretty cool now first

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.610 
are jumping around pretty cool now first
it<00:00:56.100> wasn't<00:00:56.280> obvious<00:00:56.550> what<00:00:57.329> this<00:00:57.660> spawned<00:00:58.140> flak

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
it wasn't obvious what this spawned flak

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.310 
it wasn't obvious what this spawned flak
around<00:00:59.010> airborne<00:00:59.489> target<00:01:00.120> was<00:01:00.300> it<00:01:00.930> took<00:01:01.140> me<00:01:01.289> a

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
around airborne target was it took me a

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.590 
around airborne target was it took me a
while<00:01:01.500> to<00:01:01.559> figure<00:01:01.920> it<00:01:02.100> out<00:01:02.219> and<00:01:02.550> you<00:01:03.210> can<00:01:03.239> best

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
while to figure it out and you can best

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.200 
while to figure it out and you can best
see<00:01:03.870> this<00:01:04.049> effect<00:01:04.530> with<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:05.010> constant<00:01:05.760> stream

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
see this effect with the constant stream

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.990 
see this effect with the constant stream
laser<00:01:06.630> gun<00:01:07.140> now<00:01:07.950> i'm<00:01:08.040> going<00:01:08.159> to<00:01:08.220> unequip<00:01:08.790> this

laser gun now i'm going to unequip this

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000 
laser gun now i'm going to unequip this
oscott<00:01:09.689> so<00:01:09.810> you<00:01:09.900> can<00:01:10.020> see<00:01:10.260> what<00:01:10.500> the<00:01:10.680> laser

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
oscott so you can see what the laser

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.120 
oscott so you can see what the laser
does<00:01:11.400> normally<00:01:12.030> yeah<00:01:12.930> you<00:01:13.229> can<00:01:13.380> see<00:01:13.530> pretty

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
does normally yeah you can see pretty

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.390 
does normally yeah you can see pretty
normal<00:01:14.430> damage<00:01:14.960> now<00:01:15.960> i'm<00:01:16.229> going<00:01:16.530> to<00:01:16.619> equip<00:01:17.250> the

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
normal damage now i'm going to equip the

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.359 
normal damage now i'm going to equip the
ack-ack<00:01:17.939> and<00:01:18.270> you<00:01:19.140> can<00:01:19.350> see<00:01:19.619> here<00:01:19.890> now<00:01:20.070> that

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
ack-ack and you can see here now that

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.760 
ack-ack and you can see here now that
when<00:01:20.520> i'm<00:01:20.610> firing<00:01:20.970> it<00:01:21.150> at<00:01:21.270> this<00:01:21.479> enemy<00:01:22.020> there

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
when i'm firing it at this enemy there

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.460 
when i'm firing it at this enemy there
are<00:01:22.979> smaller<00:01:23.490> explosions<00:01:23.939> all<00:01:24.630> around<00:01:24.689> the

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
are smaller explosions all around the

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.859 
are smaller explosions all around the
enemy<00:01:25.799> doing<00:01:26.130> additional<00:01:26.759> damage<00:01:27.240> the

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
enemy doing additional damage the

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.350 
enemy doing additional damage the
explosions<00:01:28.590> look<00:01:28.860> exactly<00:01:29.610> like<00:01:29.640> a<00:01:29.909> flak<00:01:30.329> ER

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
explosions look exactly like a flak ER

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.910 
explosions look exactly like a flak ER
which<00:01:30.659> I'm<00:01:30.869> sure<00:01:31.049> is<00:01:31.110> where<00:01:31.409> the<00:01:31.530> reference

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
which I'm sure is where the reference

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.950 
which I'm sure is where the reference
comes<00:01:32.220> from<00:01:32.430> another<00:01:33.150> cool<00:01:33.420> thing<00:01:33.450> about<00:01:33.720> this

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
comes from another cool thing about this

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.890 
comes from another cool thing about this
oz<00:01:34.229> kit<00:01:34.590> is<00:01:34.799> that<00:01:35.070> you<00:01:35.220> can<00:01:35.400> still<00:01:35.820> spawn<00:01:36.329> flak

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
oz kit is that you can still spawn flak

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.690 
oz kit is that you can still spawn flak
when<00:01:36.930> you're<00:01:37.439> riding<00:01:37.710> in<00:01:38.040> a<00:01:38.130> vehicle<00:01:38.310> and

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
when you're riding in a vehicle and

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.210 
when you're riding in a vehicle and
shooting<00:01:39.240> at<00:01:39.360> an<00:01:39.479> airborne<00:01:39.810> target<00:01:40.320> this<00:01:41.009> is

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
shooting at an airborne target this is

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.490 
shooting at an airborne target this is
pretty<00:01:41.460> cool<00:01:41.790> and<00:01:42.030> makes<00:01:42.720> shooting<00:01:43.020> at<00:01:43.320> things

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
pretty cool and makes shooting at things

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.530 
pretty cool and makes shooting at things
with<00:01:43.649> a<00:01:43.740> vehicle<00:01:44.070> a<00:01:44.340> lot<00:01:44.670> more<00:01:44.880> effective

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
with a vehicle a lot more effective

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.590 
with a vehicle a lot more effective
because<00:01:45.750> of<00:01:46.049> the<00:01:46.140> added<00:01:46.350> explosive<00:01:47.310> damage

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:47.600 
because of the added explosive damage

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.389 
because of the added explosive damage
overall<00:01:48.600> this<00:01:48.869> seems<00:01:49.140> like<00:01:49.259> a<00:01:49.409> decent<00:01:49.649> oz<00:01:50.100> kit

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
overall this seems like a decent oz kit

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.490 
overall this seems like a decent oz kit
and<00:01:50.670> could<00:01:51.030> become<00:01:51.420> very<00:01:51.780> useful<00:01:52.320> in

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
and could become very useful in

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.069 
and could become very useful in
particular<00:01:52.890> situations<00:01:53.570> so<00:01:54.570> that's<00:01:54.750> the

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
particular situations so that's the

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.319 
particular situations so that's the
acidic<00:01:55.500> ack<00:01:55.740> ack<00:01:55.979> thanks<00:01:56.880> for<00:01:57.030> watching
