00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
the Samsung Galaxy s6 edge that we saw

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.089 
the Samsung Galaxy s6 edge that we saw
launched<00:00:09.540> earlier<00:00:09.900> on<00:00:10.019> this<00:00:10.139> year<00:00:10.200> I'm<00:00:10.860> going

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
launched earlier on this year I'm going

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:11.959 
launched earlier on this year I'm going
to<00:00:11.160> take<00:00:11.309> you<00:00:11.460> through<00:00:11.700> it

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
to take you through it

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:15.289 
to take you through it
basically<00:00:12.480> the<00:00:12.750> s6<00:00:13.410> edge+<00:00:13.950> is<00:00:14.219> just<00:00:14.700> a<00:00:14.820> larger

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
basically the s6 edge+ is just a larger

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.170 
basically the s6 edge+ is just a larger
s6<00:00:15.900> edge<00:00:16.139> there's<00:00:16.770> a<00:00:16.859> few<00:00:17.100> enhancements<00:00:17.430> to<00:00:18.000> it

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
s6 edge there's a few enhancements to it

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.150 
s6 edge there's a few enhancements to it
one<00:00:18.930> of<00:00:19.020> the<00:00:19.109> obvious<00:00:19.230> ones<00:00:19.470> is<00:00:19.740> the<00:00:19.830> fact<00:00:20.010> it

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
one of the obvious ones is the fact it

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.150 
one of the obvious ones is the fact it
has<00:00:20.279> a<00:00:20.310> 5.7<00:00:21.150> inch<00:00:21.570> screen<00:00:21.840> instead<00:00:22.140> of<00:00:22.230> a<00:00:22.320> 5.1

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
has a 5.7 inch screen instead of a 5.1

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.300 
has a 5.7 inch screen instead of a 5.1
inch<00:00:23.400> screen<00:00:23.699> it's<00:00:24.060> still<00:00:24.350> qHD<00:00:25.350> or<00:00:25.590> 2k<00:00:25.800> on<00:00:26.189> a

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
inch screen it's still qHD or 2k on a

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.650 
inch screen it's still qHD or 2k on a
call<00:00:26.490> at<00:00:26.609> that<00:00:27.080> 2560<00:00:28.080> by<00:00:28.619> 1440<00:00:29.340> which<00:00:30.269> which

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
call at that 2560 by 1440 which which

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.110 
call at that 2560 by 1440 which which
means<00:00:30.900> they're<00:00:31.109> even<00:00:31.410> over<00:00:31.800> 5.7<00:00:32.610> inches<00:00:32.880> it's

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
means they're even over 5.7 inches it's

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.389 
means they're even over 5.7 inches it's
it's<00:00:33.360> incredibly<00:00:33.870> crisp<00:00:34.170> and<00:00:34.440> its<00:00:34.829> uses<00:00:35.309> a

it's incredibly crisp and its uses a

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.729 
it's incredibly crisp and its uses a
mellow<00:00:35.670> tech<00:00:35.969> as<00:00:36.210> Samsung<00:00:36.719> tends<00:00:37.230> to<00:00:37.440> do<00:00:37.559> these

because<00:00:38.760> it<00:00:38.879> has<00:00:39.030> a<00:00:39.059> larger<00:00:39.480> screen<00:00:39.690> there's

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
because it has a larger screen there's

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.840 
because it has a larger screen there's
more<00:00:40.290> edge<00:00:40.469> to<00:00:40.710> play<00:00:40.890> with<00:00:41.100> which<00:00:41.309> means<00:00:41.550> that

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
more edge to play with which means that

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.700 
more edge to play with which means that
instead<00:00:42.300> of<00:00:42.420> just<00:00:42.540> pulling<00:00:42.780> in<00:00:43.050> contacts<00:00:43.559> on

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
instead of just pulling in contacts on

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.560 
instead of just pulling in contacts on
the<00:00:43.800> side<00:00:44.040> you<00:00:44.520> can<00:00:44.550> also<00:00:44.820> pull<00:00:45.149> in<00:00:45.270> your<00:00:45.390> most

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
the side you can also pull in your most

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.990 
the side you can also pull in your most
used<00:00:45.989> apps<00:00:46.230> my<00:00:47.100> hope<00:00:47.280> is<00:00:47.460> that<00:00:47.489> as<00:00:47.789> the

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
used apps my hope is that as the

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.700 
used apps my hope is that as the
technology<00:00:48.510> matures<00:00:48.840> Samsung<00:00:49.289> keeps<00:00:49.500> adding

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
technology matures Samsung keeps adding

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.950 
technology matures Samsung keeps adding
functionalities<00:00:50.640> for<00:00:50.670> those<00:00:50.940> edges<00:00:51.390> so<00:00:51.930> that

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
functionalities for those edges so that

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.930 
functionalities for those edges so that
it<00:00:52.110> is<00:00:52.379> instead<00:00:53.160> of<00:00:53.219> being<00:00:53.460> something<00:00:53.699> that's

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
it is instead of being something that's

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.369 
it is instead of being something that's
nice<00:00:54.120> to<00:00:54.390> have<00:00:54.570> it's<00:00:54.809> something<00:00:55.140> that<00:00:55.260> becomes

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
nice to have it's something that becomes

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.250 
nice to have it's something that becomes
actually<00:00:56.370> essential<00:00:56.850> in<00:00:56.969> these<00:00:57.120> products<00:00:57.390> it

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
actually essential in these products it

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.110 
actually essential in these products it
runs<00:00:58.440> the<00:00:58.530> same<00:00:58.590> processor<00:00:59.309> as<00:00:59.550> the<00:00:59.969> other

runs the same processor as the other

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.209 
runs the same processor as the other
devices<00:01:00.390> in<00:01:00.510> the<00:01:00.719> range<00:01:00.930> that's<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:01.500> Samsung

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
devices in the range that's the Samsung

Exynos also port which we found

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.260 
Exynos also port which we found
incredibly<00:01:04.979> fast<00:01:05.220> with<00:01:05.489> those<00:01:05.610> other<00:01:05.790> devices

incredibly fast with those other devices

incredibly fast with those other devices
and<00:01:06.450> we<00:01:06.510> expect<00:01:06.810> more<00:01:06.840> of<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.140> same<00:01:07.170> from<00:01:07.530> this

we'll<00:02:50.820> see<00:02:51.060> I<00:02:51.090> mean<00:02:51.359> we've<00:02:51.989> been<00:02:52.140> very

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320 
we'll see I mean we've been very

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.160 
we'll see I mean we've been very

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.170 
impressed by the battery life but also

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:57.140 
impressed by the battery life but also
the<00:02:55.170> the<00:02:55.470> fast<00:02:55.680> charging<00:02:55.980> capabilities<00:02:56.700> of

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
the s6 and the s6 edge so we're

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:00.289 
the s6 and the s6 edge so we're
expecting<00:02:59.250> more<00:02:59.459> of<00:02:59.640> the<00:02:59.730> same<00:02:59.880> for<00:03:00.060> missile

00:03:00.289 --> 00:03:00.299

attack<00:03:00.480> one<00:03:01.019> intriguing<00:03:01.410> piece<00:03:01.709> of

functionality<00:03:02.100> that<00:03:02.519> I'm<00:03:02.760> just<00:03:02.970> a<00:03:03.060> little<00:03:03.420> bit

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540

skeptical<00:03:03.900> of<00:03:04.109> is<00:03:04.260> this<00:03:04.859> devices<00:03:05.280> capability

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:05.850 
skeptical of is this devices capability

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:07.460 
skeptical of is this devices capability
to<00:03:06.030> upscale<00:03:06.450> the<00:03:06.600> music<00:03:06.900> that<00:03:07.049> you<00:03:07.140> listen<00:03:07.260> to

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
to upscale the music that you listen to

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:10.550 
to upscale the music that you listen to
so<00:03:07.950> there's<00:03:08.100> a<00:03:08.160> 24<00:03:08.609> bit<00:03:08.880> 192<00:03:09.359> kilohertz<00:03:09.870> DAC<00:03:10.380> in

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
so there's a 24 bit 192 kilohertz DAC in

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.340 
so there's a 24 bit 192 kilohertz DAC in

Samsung<00:03:46.280> has<00:03:46.370> been<00:03:46.489> very<00:03:46.700> careful<00:03:47.180> to<00:03:47.209> to<00:03:47.900> let

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:48.140 
Samsung has been very careful to to let

Samsung has been very careful to to let
the<00:03:48.350> the<00:03:48.650> quality<00:03:49.070> Android<00:03:49.459> app<00:03:49.610> shine

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:49.910 
the the quality Android app shine

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:51.759 
the the quality Android app shine
through<00:03:50.300> rather<00:03:50.840> than<00:03:50.989> stuffing<00:03:51.380> it<00:03:51.470> full<00:03:51.500> of

00:03:51.759 --> 00:03:51.769 
through rather than stuffing it full of

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:54.220 
through rather than stuffing it full of
bloatware<00:03:52.040> so<00:03:52.730> I<00:03:53.060> have<00:03:53.420> high<00:03:53.570> hopes<00:03:53.600> this<00:03:54.050> is

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:54.230 
bloatware so I have high hopes this is

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:56.590 
bloatware so I have high hopes this is
going<00:03:54.350> to<00:03:54.410> keep<00:03:54.620> running<00:03:54.860> quickly<00:03:55.459> after<00:03:56.330> some

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:56.600 
going to keep running quickly after some

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:59.140 
going to keep running quickly after some
time<00:03:56.840> of<00:03:56.870> years<00:03:57.200> now<00:03:57.980> what<00:03:58.280> the<00:03:58.459> s6<00:03:58.790> edge+

00:03:59.140 --> 00:03:59.150 
time of years now what the s6 edge+

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:01.059 
time of years now what the s6 edge+
definitely<00:03:59.690> isn't<00:04:00.050> is<00:04:00.200> the<00:04:00.320> samsung<00:04:00.739> galaxy
