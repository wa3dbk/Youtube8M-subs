this<00:01:03.239> is<00:01:03.420> an<00:01:03.510> amazing<00:01:03.750> piece<00:01:04.170> of<00:01:04.199> technology

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
this is an amazing piece of technology

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.950 
this is an amazing piece of technology
here<00:01:05.040> and<00:01:05.220> most<00:01:05.909> importantly<00:01:06.090> I<00:01:06.510> mean<00:01:06.810> it's<00:01:06.930> a

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
here and most importantly I mean it's a

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.090 
here and most importantly I mean it's a
lot<00:01:07.080> of<00:01:07.140> technological<00:01:07.530> technological

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
lot of technological technological

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.700 
lot of technological technological
horsepower<00:01:08.970> but<00:01:09.119> most<00:01:09.600> importantly<00:01:10.080> it<00:01:10.530> just

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
horsepower but most importantly it just

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.410 
horsepower but most importantly it just
sounds<00:01:11.010> great<00:01:11.130> so<00:01:11.400> let<00:01:11.939> me<00:01:12.000> take<00:01:12.180> you<00:01:12.270> through

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
sounds great so let me take you through

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:21.710 
sounds great so let me take you through
a<00:01:12.450> couple<00:01:12.570> of<00:01:12.780> Pat's<00:01:12.930> sure<00:01:13.200> let's<00:01:13.439> hear<00:01:13.619> it

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.950 

so<00:01:22.320> what<00:01:22.500> we<00:01:22.620> have<00:01:22.740> like<00:01:22.920> a<00:01:23.070> little<00:01:23.280> area

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
so what we have like a little area

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.750 
so what we have like a little area
so<00:01:25.530> this<00:01:25.680> is<00:01:25.800> kind<00:01:26.010> of<00:01:26.040> a<00:01:26.130> delayed<00:01:26.400> shimmer

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:26.760 
so this is kind of a delayed shimmer

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:29.270 
so this is kind of a delayed shimmer
it's<00:01:27.270> a<00:01:27.420> delay<00:01:27.720> mixed<00:01:28.080> in<00:01:28.200> with<00:01:28.350> them<00:01:28.590> with<00:01:29.250> a

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
it's a delay mixed in with them with a

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.710 
it's a delay mixed in with them with a
filter<00:01:29.610> that<00:01:29.940> sounds<00:01:30.270> actually<00:01:30.390> like<00:01:30.690> a

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
filter that sounds actually like a

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.810 
filter that sounds actually like a
chorus<00:01:31.230> so<00:01:31.830> you're<00:01:32.010> getting<00:01:32.280> two<00:01:32.460> different

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
chorus so you're getting two different

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.850 
chorus so you're getting two different
sounds<00:01:32.940> at<00:01:33.180> the<00:01:33.240> same<00:01:33.300> time<00:01:33.810> so<00:01:34.380> it's<00:01:34.530> delaying

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
sounds at the same time so it's delaying

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.110 
sounds at the same time so it's delaying
and<00:01:35.130> course<00:01:35.400> because<00:01:35.730> there's<00:01:35.910> two<00:01:36.090> different

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:36.120 
and course because there's two different

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:39.320 
and course because there's two different
channels<00:01:36.600> in<00:01:36.930> there<00:01:37.080> so<00:01:37.880> to<00:01:38.880> move<00:01:38.970> on<00:01:39.150> to

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:39.330 
channels in there so to move on to

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:39.800 
channels in there so to move on to
another<00:01:39.570> one

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
another one

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.340 
another one
and<00:01:40.490> this<00:01:41.490> one<00:01:41.670> is<00:01:41.820> what<00:01:42.540> we<00:01:42.660> are<00:01:42.780> at<00:01:42.930> Nashville

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
and this one is what we are at Nashville

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:54.650 
and this one is what we are at Nashville
right<00:01:52.280> sound<00:01:53.280> it<00:01:53.460> sounds<00:01:53.790> analog<00:01:54.210> though<00:01:54.420> and

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:54.660 
right sound it sounds analog though and

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:56.870 
right sound it sounds analog though and
the<00:01:54.810> eyes<00:01:55.680> are<00:01:55.920> getting<00:01:56.010> rolled<00:01:56.280> off<00:01:56.460> okay

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
the eyes are getting rolled off okay

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.190 
the eyes are getting rolled off okay
they<00:01:57.000> are<00:01:57.119> getting<00:01:57.330> rolled<00:01:57.540> off<00:01:57.720> so<00:01:57.930> there's

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
they are getting rolled off so there's

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.230 
they are getting rolled off so there's
there's<00:01:58.560> two<00:01:58.860> that<00:01:59.430> are<00:01:59.490> going<00:01:59.700> on<00:01:59.880> here<00:02:00.060> this

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
there's two that are going on here this

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.170 
there's two that are going on here this
vintage<00:02:00.600> in<00:02:00.990> digital<00:02:01.440> a<00:02:01.649> vintage<00:02:02.520> digital<00:02:02.970> and

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
vintage in digital a vintage digital and

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.480 
vintage in digital a vintage digital and
analog<00:02:03.899> so<00:02:04.170> when<00:02:04.740> you're<00:02:04.890> here<00:02:05.070> and<00:02:05.190> there<00:02:05.340> is

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
analog so when you're here and there is

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.160 
analog so when you're here and there is
correct<00:02:05.790> you<00:02:05.910> got<00:02:06.030> great<00:02:06.240> ear<00:02:06.420> so<00:02:06.630> it<00:02:07.020> does

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
correct you got great ear so it does

correct you got great ear so it does
have<00:02:07.380> the<00:02:07.470> vintage<00:02:07.649> digital<00:02:08.250> and<00:02:08.640> it<00:02:08.759> also<00:02:08.880> has

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
have the vintage digital and it also has

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:10.910 
have the vintage digital and it also has
the<00:02:09.360> analog<00:02:09.720> in<00:02:09.899> there<00:02:10.020> so<00:02:10.200> it's<00:02:10.590> just<00:02:10.709> really

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
the analog in there so it's just really

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.890 
the analog in there so it's just really
cool<00:02:11.160> car<00:02:11.430> cross<00:02:11.790> pollenization<00:02:12.239> of<00:02:12.660> the<00:02:12.750> two

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
cool car cross pollenization of the two

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:18.410 
cool car cross pollenization of the two
in<00:02:13.050> them<00:02:13.230> so<00:02:15.260> we<00:02:16.260> have<00:02:16.380> another<00:02:17.150> patch<00:02:18.150> here

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
in them so we have another patch here

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:19.790 
in them so we have another patch here
that's<00:02:18.600> really<00:02:19.020> beautiful<00:02:19.470> it's<00:02:19.620> like<00:02:19.650> a

really cool let's check it out here's

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:29.190 
really cool let's check it out here's
one<00:04:28.720> of<00:04:28.810> them

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:29.200 
one of them

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.620 
one of them
one<00:04:29.650> of<00:04:29.740> the<00:04:29.800> really<00:04:30.160> sought<00:04:30.460> after<00:04:30.640> modes<00:04:31.510> is

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:31.630 
one of the really sought after modes is

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:33.570 
one of the really sought after modes is
called<00:04:31.840> shimmer<00:04:32.230> it<00:04:32.950> sounds<00:04:33.310> like<00:04:33.400> a<00:04:33.430> little

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:33.580 
called shimmer it sounds like a little

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:48.750 
called shimmer it sounds like a little
bit<00:04:33.760> like<00:04:33.880> a<00:04:33.910> Corbin<00:04:36.750> wow<00:04:37.750> that<00:04:38.140> is<00:04:38.170> cool

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:48.760 

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:51.360 

so<00:04:49.330> let's<00:04:49.690> look<00:04:49.840> at<00:04:49.930> the<00:04:50.020> controls<00:04:50.590> on<00:04:50.830> here<00:04:51.010> so

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:51.370 
so let's look at the controls on here so

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:55.110 
so let's look at the controls on here so
we<00:04:52.120> have<00:04:52.270> effects<00:04:52.750> level<00:04:53.170> tone<00:04:53.680> time<00:04:54.430> and<00:04:54.970> then

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:55.120 
we have effects level tone time and then

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:57.810 
we have effects level tone time and then
level<00:04:55.540> um<00:04:55.780> tone<00:04:56.050> you<00:04:56.410> have<00:04:56.590> the<00:04:57.130> time<00:04:57.370> so<00:04:57.760> you

00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:57.820 
level um tone you have the time so you

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:01.200 
level um tone you have the time so you
can<00:04:58.060> really<00:04:58.210> spread<00:04:58.570> out<00:04:59.220> just<00:05:00.220> have<00:05:00.730> a<00:05:00.760> really

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:01.210 
can really spread out just have a really

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:03.840 
can really spread out just have a really
really<00:05:01.390> long<00:05:02.080> tail<00:05:02.470> on<00:05:02.530> the<00:05:02.830> reverb<00:05:03.190> you<00:05:03.670> can

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:03.850 
really long tail on the reverb you can

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:05.760 
really long tail on the reverb you can
vary<00:05:04.090> the<00:05:04.270> effect<00:05:04.630> so<00:05:04.810> you<00:05:05.020> can<00:05:05.170> tailor<00:05:05.530> to

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:05.770 
vary the effect so you can tailor to

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:07.590

that we got so you can control the level

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:18.480 
that we got so you can control the level
of<00:05:16.240> the<00:05:16.390> reverb<00:05:16.780> on<00:05:16.960> the<00:05:17.470> fly<00:05:17.680> so<00:05:18.160> that<00:05:18.190> you

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:18.490 
of the reverb on the fly so that you

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:20.100 
of the reverb on the fly so that you
don't<00:05:18.610> have<00:05:18.730> to<00:05:18.880> bend<00:05:19.540> down<00:05:19.660> and<00:05:19.720> do<00:05:19.900> words

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:20.110 
don't have to bend down and do words

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:22.200 
don't have to bend down and do words
we're<00:05:20.260> talking<00:05:20.500> here<00:05:20.980> so<00:05:21.340> you<00:05:21.430> can<00:05:21.760> use<00:05:21.940> it<00:05:22.090> to

we're talking here so you can use it to

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:24.900 
we're talking here so you can use it to
control<00:05:22.360> the<00:05:22.750> mix<00:05:23.169> the<00:05:23.410> wet<00:05:23.530> dry<00:05:23.740> mix<00:05:24.070> yeah<00:05:24.700> on

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:24.910 
control the mix the wet dry mix yeah on

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:26.700 
control the mix the wet dry mix yeah on
the<00:05:25.030> fly<00:05:25.210> so<00:05:25.450> when<00:05:25.570> you're<00:05:25.690> playing

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:26.710 
the fly so when you're playing

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:28.710 
the fly so when you're playing
you<00:05:27.160> don't<00:05:27.340> have<00:05:27.520> to<00:05:27.669> have<00:05:28.120> to<00:05:28.240> resound<00:05:28.539> the

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:28.720 
you don't have to have to resound the

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:29.939 
you don't have to have to resound the
knobs<00:05:28.900> and<00:05:29.139> if<00:05:29.199> you<00:05:29.259> do<00:05:29.380> whether<00:05:29.590> you're<00:05:29.740> doing

00:05:29.939 --> 00:05:29.949
