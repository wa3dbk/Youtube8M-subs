00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
this particular ride he's taking me up

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.910 
this particular ride he's taking me up
what<00:00:45.390> he<00:00:45.930> aptly<00:00:46.920> calls<00:00:47.190> the<00:00:47.579> idiot<00:00:48.059> trail<00:00:48.920> when

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
what he aptly calls the idiot trail when

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.360 
what he aptly calls the idiot trail when
they<00:00:50.039> first<00:00:50.340> created<00:00:51.000> this<00:00:51.360> trail<00:00:51.660> for<00:00:51.930> riding

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:52.370 
they first created this trail for riding

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:55.100 
they first created this trail for riding
you'd<00:00:53.370> have<00:00:53.550> to<00:00:53.699> be<00:00:53.820> an<00:00:53.910> idiot<00:00:54.120> to<00:00:54.300> go<00:00:54.570> back<00:00:54.840> up

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
you'd have to be an idiot to go back up

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.840 
you'd have to be an idiot to go back up
it<00:00:55.350> after<00:00:56.160> the<00:00:56.250> first<00:00:56.460> time<00:00:56.610> they<00:00:56.699> went

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
it after the first time they went

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.520 
it after the first time they went
through<00:00:57.090> or<00:00:57.510> so<00:00:57.930> he<00:00:58.140> says<00:00:58.440> so<00:00:59.660> it's<00:01:00.660> pretty<00:01:00.960> pre

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
through or so he says so it's pretty pre

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.789 
through or so he says so it's pretty pre
steep<00:01:01.800> terrain<00:01:02.309> right<00:01:02.640> through<00:01:02.910> here<00:01:03.239> and

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:03.799 
steep terrain right through here and

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:06.560 
steep terrain right through here and
we've<00:01:04.799> got<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:05.070> GoPro<00:01:05.309> mounted<00:01:06.000> on<00:01:06.180> the<00:01:06.299> side

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
we've got the GoPro mounted on the side

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.240 
we've got the GoPro mounted on the side
of<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:07.880> side<00:01:08.880> of<00:01:08.909> the<00:01:09.090> front<00:01:09.390> tire<00:01:09.630> here

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:10.250 
of the side of the front tire here

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:12.500 
of the side of the front tire here
if<00:01:11.250> you're<00:01:11.400> unfamiliar<00:01:11.820> with<00:01:11.909> the<00:01:12.030> rock<00:01:12.240> on

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
if you're unfamiliar with the rock on

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.160 
if you're unfamiliar with the rock on
motorcycles<00:01:13.470> it's<00:01:13.710> a<00:01:13.799> two<00:01:14.010> wheel<00:01:14.189> drive<00:01:14.220> bike

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.170 
motorcycles it's a two wheel drive bike

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.649 
motorcycles it's a two wheel drive bike
kind<00:01:16.170> of<00:01:16.290> like<00:01:16.470> a<00:01:16.580> reminiscent<00:01:17.580> of<00:01:17.670> like<00:01:18.479> an

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
kind of like a reminiscent of like an

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.469 
kind of like a reminiscent of like an
old<00:01:18.900> Willys<00:01:19.439> Jeep<00:01:19.799> or<00:01:20.040> maybe<00:01:20.250> like<00:01:20.520> a<00:01:20.549> Humvee<00:01:21.450> I

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
old Willys Jeep or maybe like a Humvee I

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.510 
old Willys Jeep or maybe like a Humvee I
mean<00:01:21.780> these<00:01:21.900> things<00:01:22.170> just<00:01:22.380> go<00:01:22.680> anywhere

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
mean these things just go anywhere

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.719 
mean these things just go anywhere
and<00:01:23.689> so<00:01:24.689> we're<00:01:25.500> climbing<00:01:25.770> up<00:01:26.009> a<00:01:26.100> pretty<00:01:26.460> steep

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
and so we're climbing up a pretty steep

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.310 
and so we're climbing up a pretty steep
grade<00:01:26.759> as<00:01:27.299> you<00:01:27.390> can<00:01:27.540> see<00:01:27.720> we're<00:01:27.960> coming<00:01:28.229> up

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
grade as you can see we're coming up

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.170 
grade as you can see we're coming up
through<00:01:28.590> you<00:01:29.250> know<00:01:29.340> quite<00:01:29.579> a<00:01:29.610> bit<00:01:29.700> of<00:01:29.909> water

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
through you know quite a bit of water

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.249 
through you know quite a bit of water
here<00:01:30.329> and<00:01:31.729> this<00:01:32.729> little<00:01:33.479> cross<00:01:33.720> in<00:01:33.750> here<00:01:34.140> it

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
here and this little cross in here it

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.030 
here and this little cross in here it
doesn't<00:01:34.560> look<00:01:34.710> too<00:01:35.990> too<00:01:36.990> big<00:01:37.650> or<00:01:38.009> too

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
doesn't look too too big or too

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.240 
doesn't look too too big or too
difficult<00:01:38.520> on<00:01:39.390> this<00:01:40.259> video<00:01:40.650> but<00:01:40.979> you<00:01:41.159> know

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
difficult on this video but you know

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.550 
difficult on this video but you know
there's<00:01:41.430> probably<00:01:41.670> you<00:01:42.540> know<00:01:42.630> a<00:01:42.659> foot<00:01:43.350> and<00:01:43.470> a

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
there's probably you know a foot and a

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.810 
there's probably you know a foot and a
half<00:01:43.770> in<00:01:44.630> height<00:01:45.630> the<00:01:46.079> log<00:01:46.320> here<00:01:46.740> and<00:01:46.950> trying

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
half in height the log here and trying

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.679 
half in height the log here and trying
to<00:01:47.909> get<00:01:48.509> up<00:01:48.630> and<00:01:48.840> over<00:01:48.990> it<00:01:49.820> so<00:01:50.820> just<00:01:51.030> you<00:01:51.509> can

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
to get up and over it so just you can

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.389 
to get up and over it so just you can
see<00:01:51.720> the<00:01:51.990> front<00:01:52.229> tire<00:01:52.470> they're<00:01:52.740> spinning<00:01:53.100> cuz

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
see the front tire they're spinning cuz

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.160 
see the front tire they're spinning cuz
you<00:01:53.549> know<00:01:53.610> they're<00:01:53.759> just<00:01:53.840> two-wheel<00:01:54.840> drive

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
you know they're just two-wheel drive

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.889 
you know they're just two-wheel drive
and<00:01:55.470> so<00:01:55.590> that<00:01:55.799> front<00:01:56.549> tire<00:01:56.729> is<00:01:56.969> really<00:01:57.689> digging

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
and so that front tire is really digging

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:01.399 
and so that front tire is really digging
into<00:01:58.200> that<00:01:58.640> mossy<00:01:59.640> wet<00:02:00.090> yucca<00:02:00.540> log<00:02:00.840> trying<00:02:01.320> to

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
into that mossy wet yucca log trying to

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.490 
into that mossy wet yucca log trying to
beat<00:02:01.500> up<00:02:01.619> over<00:02:01.979> it<00:02:02.100> and<00:02:02.310> there<00:02:03.180> it<00:02:03.500> finally

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
beat up over it and there it finally

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.999 
beat up over it and there it finally
musters<00:02:04.890> over<00:02:05.250> it<00:02:06.200> you<00:02:07.200> know<00:02:07.259> this<00:02:07.439> particular

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
musters over it you know this particular

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.200 
musters over it you know this particular
trail<00:02:08.340> is<00:02:08.789> very<00:02:09.030> soupy<00:02:09.840> very<00:02:10.110> muddy<00:02:10.440> as

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:11.210 
trail is very soupy very muddy as

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:13.930 
trail is very soupy very muddy as
see<00:02:11.330> the<00:02:11.480> water<00:02:11.720> here<00:02:12.460> it's<00:02:13.460> not<00:02:13.610> something

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940 
see the water here it's not something

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.750

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:04.070 
of me that's a lot of fun you know these

of me that's a lot of fun you know these
bikes<00:04:04.310> are<00:04:04.490> surprisingly<00:04:05.090> light<00:04:05.390> and

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:05.780 
bikes are surprisingly light and

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:07.750 
bikes are surprisingly light and
surprisingly<00:04:06.680> nimble<00:04:06.950> for<00:04:07.280> what<00:04:07.460> they<00:04:07.580> are

surprisingly nimble for what they are

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:09.520 
surprisingly nimble for what they are
and<00:04:07.970> they<00:04:08.090> weigh<00:04:08.510> just<00:04:08.540> a<00:04:08.930> little<00:04:09.200> better<00:04:09.440> than

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:09.530 
and they weigh just a little better than

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:12.370 
and they weigh just a little better than
200<00:04:10.220> pounds<00:04:10.730> so<00:04:11.540> they're<00:04:11.720> not<00:04:11.870> really<00:04:12.110> that

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:12.380 
200 pounds so they're not really that
