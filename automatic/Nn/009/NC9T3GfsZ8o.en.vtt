00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:41.339 
marked myself a aligned level and then I

00:00:41.339 --> 00:00:44.000 
marked myself a aligned level and then I
marked<00:00:41.640> myself<00:00:41.969> another<00:00:42.210> line<00:00:42.510> it's<00:00:43.350> like<00:00:43.500> you

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
marked myself another line it's like you

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.000 
marked myself another line it's like you
can<00:00:44.160> barely<00:00:44.339> see<00:00:44.609> it<00:00:44.699> right<00:00:44.820> there<00:00:45.890> it's<00:00:46.890> just

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
can barely see it right there it's just

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.729 
can barely see it right there it's just
from<00:00:47.190> here<00:00:47.370> to<00:00:47.489> there<00:00:47.640> just<00:00:48.350> trying<00:00:49.350> to<00:00:49.440> guess

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
from here to there just trying to guess

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.160 
from here to there just trying to guess
you<00:00:50.160> know<00:00:50.280> trying<00:00:51.210> to<00:00:51.239> make<00:00:51.329> it<00:00:51.570> be<00:00:51.690> right<00:00:52.050> in

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
you know trying to make it be right in

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.270 
you know trying to make it be right in
the<00:00:52.649> middle<00:00:53.010> of<00:00:53.100> that<00:00:53.550> opening<00:00:54.089> open<00:00:54.690> spot<00:00:55.280> so

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
the middle of that opening open spot so

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.770 
the middle of that opening open spot so
I'm<00:00:56.370> going<00:00:56.519> to<00:00:56.550> put<00:00:56.730> my<00:00:56.879> template<00:00:57.359> right<00:00:57.539> there

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
I'm going to put my template right there

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.739 
I'm going to put my template right there
mark<00:00:58.620> it<00:00:58.829> and<00:00:58.949> then<00:00:59.129> I'm<00:01:00.089> going<00:01:00.239> to<00:01:00.269> try<00:01:00.449> to<00:01:00.510> cut

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:00.749 
mark it and then I'm going to try to cut

00:01:00.749 --> 00:01:02.200 
mark it and then I'm going to try to cut
it<00:01:00.870> out

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:02.210 
it out

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:04.700 
it out
probably<00:01:03.210> start<00:01:03.449> by<00:01:03.569> drilling<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:04.290> corners

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
probably start by drilling the corners

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.290 
probably start by drilling the corners
with<00:01:05.430> a<00:01:05.460> drill<00:01:05.760> bit<00:01:05.790> for<00:01:06.450> a<00:01:06.510> metal<00:01:07.020> and<00:01:07.170> then

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:08.300 
with a drill bit for a metal and then

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:12.230 
with a drill bit for a metal and then
either<00:01:09.300> with<00:01:09.600> a<00:01:09.630> jigsaw<00:01:10.110> or<00:01:10.380> a<00:01:11.040> salsa<00:01:11.550> blade<00:01:11.970> I

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
either with a jigsaw or a salsa blade I

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.340 
either with a jigsaw or a salsa blade I
mean<00:01:13.050> it's<00:01:13.200> all<00:01:13.320> song<00:01:13.560> with<00:01:13.950> a<00:01:14.090> metal<00:01:15.090> blade

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:15.350 
mean it's all song with a metal blade

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:20.780 
mean it's all song with a metal blade
and<00:01:17.810> so<00:01:18.810> I'm<00:01:19.140> gonna<00:01:19.260> see<00:01:19.380> how<00:01:19.500> that<00:01:19.530> goes<00:01:19.950> and

tips<00:01:50.000> just<00:01:51.000> to<00:01:51.210> grind<00:01:51.510> down<00:01:51.660> the<00:01:52.340> the<00:01:53.340> sides

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.130 
tips just to grind down the the sides

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:58.040 
tips just to grind down the the sides
because<00:01:56.130> when<00:01:56.490> you<00:01:56.610> cut<00:01:56.790> it<00:01:56.940> it's<00:01:57.330> not<00:01:57.900> going

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:58.050 
because when you cut it it's not going

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:59.810 
because when you cut it it's not going
to<00:01:58.140> be<00:01:58.620> so<00:01:58.860> prettier<00:01:59.250> than<00:01:59.310> I'm<00:01:59.460> going<00:01:59.610> to<00:01:59.670> fit

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
to be so prettier than I'm going to fit

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.370 
to be so prettier than I'm going to fit
perfect

this hole the light finally goes through

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:13.370

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:23.880 
holes for the for the bolts that I may
use<00:02:17.700> so<00:02:19.140> there's<00:02:20.140> a<00:02:20.230> line<00:02:20.440> right<00:02:20.620> there<00:02:20.860> and<00:02:22.890> I

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
use so there's a line right there and I

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:25.830 
use so there's a line right there and I
already<00:02:24.790> cut<00:02:25.030> the<00:02:25.120> other<00:02:25.239> one<00:02:25.360> I<00:02:25.420> just<00:02:25.480> need<00:02:25.750> to

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:49.240 
that's the light and the boats I put on

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:52.530 
that's the light and the boats I put on
there<00:02:50.400> the<00:02:51.400> other<00:02:51.580> side<00:02:51.790> is<00:02:51.940> the<00:02:52.060> same<00:02:52.240> thing

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
there the other side is the same thing

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:58.340 
there the other side is the same thing
and<00:02:55.020> right<00:02:56.020> here<00:02:56.230> is<00:02:56.350> where<00:02:56.380> you<00:02:56.680> have<00:02:56.710> the

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
and right here is where you have the

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:02.400 
and right here is where you have the
bunch<00:02:59.350> of<00:02:59.500> wires<00:03:00.120> and<00:03:01.120> I<00:03:01.240> follow<00:03:01.540> them<00:03:01.810> when<00:03:02.380> I

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:02.410 
bunch of wires and I follow them when I

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:05.700 
bunch of wires and I follow them when I
install<00:03:02.800> this<00:03:02.920> other<00:03:03.160> lights<00:03:03.460> turn<00:03:03.850> here<00:03:04.710> and

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:05.710 
install this other lights turn here and

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:08.970 
install this other lights turn here and
I<00:03:06.070> followed<00:03:06.430> them<00:03:06.460> to<00:03:06.580> the<00:03:06.910> taillights<00:03:07.950> so<00:03:08.950> I

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:08.980 
I followed them to the taillights so I

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:10.710 
I followed them to the taillights so I
knew<00:03:09.250> those<00:03:09.430> were<00:03:09.490> the<00:03:09.790> ones<00:03:09.970> and<00:03:10.240> then<00:03:10.420> I<00:03:10.510> just

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
knew those were the ones and then I just

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:15.750 
knew those were the ones and then I just
tapped<00:03:11.230> into<00:03:11.470> the<00:03:13.320> the<00:03:14.320> lighter<00:03:14.560> gray<00:03:14.920> which

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 
tapped into the the lighter gray which

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.450 
tapped into the the lighter gray which
is<00:03:15.790> powerful<00:03:16.540> reversed<00:03:16.930> and<00:03:17.230> then<00:03:18.070> the<00:03:18.250> black

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:18.460 
is powerful reversed and then the black

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:23.640 
is powerful reversed and then the black
one<00:03:18.670> is<00:03:19.080> ground<00:03:20.730> so<00:03:21.730> if<00:03:22.690> you<00:03:22.930> just<00:03:23.200> use<00:03:23.440> those

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:23.650 
one is ground so if you just use those

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:25.950 
one is ground so if you just use those
you'll<00:03:24.370> be<00:03:24.610> able<00:03:24.880> to<00:03:25.150> connect<00:03:25.480> the<00:03:25.660> anti

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:25.960 
you'll be able to connect the anti

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:27.510 
you'll be able to connect the anti
lights<00:03:26.170> I<00:03:26.470> wouldn't<00:03:26.920> connect<00:03:27.220> too<00:03:27.340> many

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:27.520 
lights I wouldn't connect too many

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:30.410 
lights I wouldn't connect too many
lights<00:03:27.760> to<00:03:28.270> the<00:03:28.390> reverse<00:03:28.720> though<00:03:28.990> without<00:03:29.530> a<00:03:29.740> a

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420 
lights to the reverse though without a a

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:34.920 
lights to the reverse though without a a
relay<00:03:31.420> or<00:03:31.450> something<00:03:33.600> because<00:03:34.600> you<00:03:34.750> might

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:34.930 
relay or something because you might

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:38.370 
relay or something because you might
blow<00:03:35.140> a<00:03:35.170> fuse<00:03:35.970> but<00:03:36.970> but<00:03:37.660> with<00:03:37.810> this<00:03:37.930> tool<00:03:38.140> ice

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:38.380 
blow a fuse but but with this tool ice

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:42.180 
blow a fuse but but with this tool ice
um<00:03:38.770> I<00:03:39.220> don't<00:03:40.000> think<00:03:40.180> it's<00:03:40.300> a<00:03:40.360> problem<00:03:40.980> I'm<00:03:41.980> just

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:42.190 
um I don't think it's a problem I'm just

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:45.210 
um I don't think it's a problem I'm just
going<00:03:42.310> to<00:03:42.370> connect<00:03:42.730> those<00:03:42.850> up<00:03:42.910> and<00:03:43.980> see<00:03:44.980> if<00:03:45.070> it

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:45.220 
going to connect those up and see if it

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:53.720 
going to connect those up and see if it
works

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:53.730 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:57.210

00:03:59.339 --> 00:03:59.349 
I haven't removed the other lights but

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:02.910 
I haven't removed the other lights but
they're<00:03:59.500> disconnected<00:04:00.330> and<00:04:01.330> I<00:04:01.510> got<00:04:01.720> a<00:04:01.920> shirt

they're disconnected and I got a shirt
on<00:04:02.950> top<00:04:03.280> of<00:04:03.489> the<00:04:03.670> sensor<00:04:04.599> so<00:04:04.780> it<00:04:04.900> thinks<00:04:05.110> it's

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:05.260 
on top of the sensor so it thinks it's

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:06.600 
on top of the sensor so it thinks it's
nice<00:04:05.409> so<00:04:05.650> if<00:04:05.830> I<00:04:05.950> click<00:04:06.220> the<00:04:06.370> unlock<00:04:06.549> button

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:55.070 
something because we really don't have

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:57.070 
something because we really don't have
many<00:04:55.460> of<00:04:55.639> those<00:04:55.759> around<00:04:56.030> we're<00:04:56.360> well<00:04:56.810> I<00:04:56.840> meant
