00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:03.570 
hey guys I am proud and what you are

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:06.530 
hey guys I am proud and what you are
looking<00:00:03.959> at<00:00:04.140> right<00:00:04.440> now<00:00:04.470> is<00:00:05.040> a<00:00:05.759> working<00:00:06.299> model

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:06.540 
looking at right now is a working model

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.799 
looking at right now is a working model
of<00:00:06.779> the<00:00:07.020> solar<00:00:07.230> system<00:00:07.830> made<00:00:08.130> in<00:00:08.280> Minecraft<00:00:08.809> so

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
of the solar system made in Minecraft so

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:11.629 
of the solar system made in Minecraft so
as<00:00:10.019> you<00:00:10.139> can<00:00:10.320> see<00:00:10.500> there's<00:00:10.860> the<00:00:11.130> Sun<00:00:11.340> in<00:00:11.550> the

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
as you can see there's the Sun in the

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:14.060 
as you can see there's the Sun in the
middle<00:00:11.790> and<00:00:12.179> all<00:00:12.870> the<00:00:13.110> planets<00:00:13.440> are<00:00:13.710> orbiting

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
middle and all the planets are orbiting

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:20.150 
middle and all the planets are orbiting
around<00:00:14.429> it<00:00:15.560> let's<00:00:16.560> take<00:00:16.890> a<00:00:17.070> closer<00:00:17.400> look

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.759 

here's<00:00:20.760> the<00:00:20.940> Sun<00:00:21.180> and

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:24.769 

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:27.200 

here's<00:00:25.369> the<00:00:25.550> earth

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
here's the earth

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.790 
here's the earth
this<00:00:27.779> is<00:00:27.929> Mars<00:00:28.199> and<00:00:28.769> all<00:00:29.220> the<00:00:30.060> other<00:00:30.210> planets

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:30.800 
this is Mars and all the other planets

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.360 
this is Mars and all the other planets
around<00:00:31.800> it

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:33.370 
around it

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:37.639 
around it
I<00:00:33.460> used<00:00:34.559> textures<00:00:35.559> from<00:00:35.949> there<00:00:36.579> are<00:00:36.789> photos<00:00:37.239> of

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
I used textures from there are photos of

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:42.540 
I used textures from there are photos of
the<00:00:39.180> real<00:00:40.180> photos<00:00:40.570> of<00:00:40.719> the<00:00:40.840> planets<00:00:41.340> as<00:00:42.340> you

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:42.550 
the real photos of the planets as you

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:44.880 
the real photos of the planets as you
can<00:00:42.699> see<00:00:42.879> from<00:00:43.059> the<00:00:43.329> earth<00:00:43.480> for<00:00:43.750> example<00:00:44.260> what

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:44.890 
can see from the earth for example what

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:50.080 
can see from the earth for example what
is<00:00:44.980> it

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:50.090 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:54.860 

and<00:00:50.380> let's<00:00:51.380> see<00:00:51.680> how<00:00:52.340> I<00:00:52.610> did<00:00:52.670> it

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
and let's see how I did it

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.380 
and let's see how I did it
let's<00:00:55.410> set<00:00:55.710> the<00:00:55.920> time<00:00:56.160> today

00:00:59.380 --> 00:00:59.390 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:07.700 

and<00:00:59.480> let's<00:01:00.470> change<00:01:00.950> the<00:01:01.180> textbook

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.220 

so

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:09.230 
so

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:12.940 
so
as<00:01:09.740> you<00:01:09.920> can<00:01:10.040> see<00:01:10.250> the<00:01:10.970> Sun<00:01:11.210> is<00:01:11.450> just<00:01:11.960> glowstone

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:12.950 
as you can see the Sun is just glowstone

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:19.390 
as you can see the Sun is just glowstone
and<00:01:13.550> all<00:01:14.540> the<00:01:14.900> planets<00:01:15.290> are<00:01:15.970> blocks<00:01:16.990> and<00:01:18.400> the

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:19.400 
and all the planets are blocks and the

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.109 
and all the planets are blocks and the
reason<00:01:19.760> that<00:01:20.150> they<00:01:20.540> are<00:01:20.570> moving<00:01:20.960> is

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:23.119 
reason that they are moving is

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:25.830 
reason that they are moving is
my<00:01:23.719> cards

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:25.840 
my cards

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.770 
my cards
I<00:01:25.929> used<00:01:26.649> my<00:01:26.920> girls<00:01:27.219> as<00:01:27.579> you<00:01:27.820> can<00:01:28.090> see<00:01:28.450> from

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:28.780 
I used my girls as you can see from

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:32.770 
I used my girls as you can see from
those<00:01:29.560> two<00:01:29.859> down<00:01:30.729> years

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:32.780 
those two down years

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:38.130 
those two down years
to<00:01:33.409> move<00:01:33.619> locks<00:01:34.090> basically<00:01:35.090> I<00:01:35.270> used<00:01:35.479> mcedit<00:01:36.110> to

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:38.140 
to move locks basically I used mcedit to

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:41.230 
to move locks basically I used mcedit to
change<00:01:39.140> the<00:01:39.470> block<00:01:39.740> that<00:01:40.100> the<00:01:40.520> minecart<00:01:41.030> is

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:41.240 
change the block that the minecart is

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:46.840 
change the block that the minecart is
solving<00:01:41.659> for<00:01:42.619> example

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:46.850 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:50.140 

this<00:01:47.540> my<00:01:47.780> gut<00:01:48.049> here<00:01:48.409> is<00:01:48.860> holding<00:01:49.189> a<00:01:49.549> upper<00:01:49.939> and

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:50.150 
this my gut here is holding a upper and

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:53.859 
this my gut here is holding a upper and
with<00:01:50.930> an<00:01:51.229> z<00:01:51.409> edit<00:01:51.619> you<00:01:51.770> can<00:01:52.420> change<00:01:53.420> it<00:01:53.630> block

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:53.869 
with an z edit you can change it block

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:58.180 
with an z edit you can change it block
and<00:01:54.940> for<00:01:55.940> example<00:01:56.270> here<00:01:56.780> I<00:01:56.990> changed<00:01:57.680> it<00:01:57.920> in

00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:58.190 
and for example here I changed it in

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:04.990 
and for example here I changed it in
iron<00:01:58.640> and<00:01:59.110> I<00:02:00.110> moved<00:02:00.890> it<00:02:01.070> up<00:02:02.770> then<00:02:03.770> I<00:02:04.040> placed

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
iron and I moved it up then I placed

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.559 
iron and I moved it up then I placed
those<00:02:05.479> mine<00:02:05.840> cuts<00:02:06.170> on<00:02:06.710> these<00:02:07.310> tracks

00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:10.569 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:14.339 

and<00:02:10.659> you<00:02:11.409> can<00:02:11.620> see<00:02:11.799> the<00:02:11.920> rest<00:02:12.099> with<00:02:12.249> you<00:02:13.349> the

00:02:14.339 --> 00:02:14.349 
and you can see the rest with you the

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:18.360 
and you can see the rest with you the
cool<00:02:14.560> thing<00:02:14.829> about<00:02:15.069> this<00:02:15.489> is<00:02:15.760> that<00:02:17.159> the<00:02:18.159> light

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
cool thing about this is that the light

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:23.099 
cool thing about this is that the light
of<00:02:18.700> the<00:02:20.099> this<00:02:21.099> block<00:02:21.400> here<00:02:21.670> is<00:02:22.359> the<00:02:22.629> same<00:02:22.840> light

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:23.109 
of the this block here is the same light

00:02:23.109 --> 00:02:27.330 
of the this block here is the same light
of<00:02:23.409> the<00:02:23.620> minecart<00:02:24.069> so<00:02:24.340> if<00:02:24.579> I<00:02:24.930> break<00:02:26.340> those

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
of the minecart so if I break those

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:30.420 
of the minecart so if I break those
clothes<00:02:27.670> on<00:02:27.909> now<00:02:28.840> the<00:02:28.900> minecart<00:02:29.500> is<00:02:29.709> in<00:02:29.889> a<00:02:29.980> dark

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
clothes on now the minecart is in a dark

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:34.080 
clothes on now the minecart is in a dark
spot<00:02:30.730> and<00:02:31.530> you<00:02:32.530> can<00:02:32.739> see<00:02:32.920> that<00:02:33.099> the<00:02:33.519> block<00:02:33.760> here

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
spot and you can see that the block here

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:40.619 
spot and you can see that the block here
is<00:02:34.299> darker<00:02:35.189> and<00:02:37.049> that's<00:02:38.049> why<00:02:39.060> those<00:02:40.060> planets

00:02:40.619 --> 00:02:40.629 
is darker and that's why those planets

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:46.140 
is darker and that's why those planets
looks<00:02:41.019> like<00:02:41.489> they<00:02:42.489> are<00:02:42.639> glowing<00:02:44.760> as<00:02:45.760> you<00:02:45.969> can

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
looks like they are glowing as you can

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:50.020 
looks like they are glowing as you can
see

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:55.900 

the<00:02:50.660> only<00:02:51.050> problem<00:02:51.500> with<00:02:51.680> this<00:02:51.920> is<00:02:52.190> that<00:02:54.910> this

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910 
the only problem with this is that this

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:00.240 
the only problem with this is that this
if<00:02:56.810> the<00:02:57.680> minecart<00:02:58.190> is<00:02:58.460> not<00:02:58.880> in<00:02:59.180> the<00:02:59.300> screen

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250 
if the minecart is not in the screen

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:05.230 
if the minecart is not in the screen
then<00:03:01.250> this<00:03:02.240> block<00:03:02.540> is<00:03:02.750> not<00:03:02.900> rendered<00:03:04.180> so<00:03:05.180> you

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:05.240 
then this block is not rendered so you

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:11.270 
then this block is not rendered so you
need<00:03:05.750> to<00:03:06.050> look<00:03:06.620> at<00:03:06.860> this<00:03:07.570> from<00:03:08.570> above

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:15.799 

yeah<00:03:11.849> that's<00:03:12.390> all<00:03:12.599> and<00:03:12.840> thanks<00:03:13.620> for<00:03:13.739> watching
