when you're playing as well hareen I

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:09.260 
when you're playing as well hareen I
mean<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.710> controls<00:01:08.189> are<00:01:08.549> what's<00:01:08.790> really

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
controls and if the controls were

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.020 
controls and if the controls were
buttered<00:01:13.979> then<00:01:14.280> I'd<00:01:14.430> give<00:01:14.670> it<00:01:14.700> a<00:01:14.850> better

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030
