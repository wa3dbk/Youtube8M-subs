00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:11.590
 does this problem come from fifa 14 

00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:12.790
 then you should know this 

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:15.750
 watch video because we show here 

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:15.750
 a solution to this problem 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.930
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:27.910
 another video for our channel bipa 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:30.370
 gaming and that is the first part now 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:31.900
 from the new video series as explain 

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:33.610
 things your former fifa has learned 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:38.590
 and now have to relearn in fifa 14 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:40.210
 the whole is called short wdf djf 14 nm and 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:41.590
 in this video series it should be up to the 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:43.420
 name already says to go things you 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:45.550
 now just do it differently in fifa 14 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:47.170
 must and has learned differently in the past and 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:49.420
 the first example we have you 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:51.310
 it's already shown before the intro 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:53.170
 just so now in fifa 14 of the 

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:54.790
 often play the ball easily 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:56.950
 very far and the reason for that 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:59.140
 the following is that he is the tempo 

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:00.670
 that's easy too 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:03.160
 now that 's more realistic with it 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:04.330
 is because when you first set the pace 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.590
 and then you put the ball 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:06.940
 a little bit further ahead can take more steps 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:09.159
 can accelerate faster 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:10.930
 and that's the problem now 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:12.640
 Of course, that's what he's up to 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:14.200
 always so far that the 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.130
 one can better arrive opponents 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.830
 just lose that a bit 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:19.360
 ball control and so it is easy 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:20.080
 for easier for the opponent that he 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.990
 ball decreases 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:24.940
 and we have a solution here now 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:26.920
 for that or simply a technique like one 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:28.210
 can avoid it all or how to do it 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.920
 can control better 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:33.100
 and that's exactly what you want now 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.900
 introduce it here in this video 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.369
 you must be able to use this technique 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:38.110
 that's the case with the controller settings 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:40.540
 just set this in here 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:43.180
 press outline on triangle or on y 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:45.670
 There is then the option analog 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:47.650
 sprint this standard off and on 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:50.080
 that needs to be set and what 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:51.549
 The purpose of the whole the lower you go 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.020
 sprint-ace pushes in the more 

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:55.000
 the player runs faster and thus 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:55.930
 is also better the pace of the 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.670
 control players 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:58.900
 Of course, then here now has the 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:01.299
 sprint also one of the two rear 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:02.650
 shoulder buttons be otherwise otherwise 

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:04.330
 I do not really think the option yes 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:06.189
 I can fine tune that 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:07.810
 we show whole again here now 

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:09.519
 with a controller yes here you can see 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:11.950
 it a commercial playstation 3 

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:13.310
 controller and back there are then 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:15.290
 is usually right 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:18.140
 the sprint aces and you can see it here 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:19.880
 nice you can push it in slowly 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.680
 also push out again the deeper 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.420
 you now almost pure presses the more 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.739
 faster the player and if you go 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.910
 For example, it only has halfway up then 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:28.310
 the player has not quite finished yet 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:30.170
 full speed and with that you are now 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:32.090
 then able to better control 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.860
 if and when the player can 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:35.420
 so to speak, so far as to put the ball around that 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:37.040
 to record the tempo will show the whole 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.000
 you on a specific examples like 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.310
 that looks and that too 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.019
 works in the example make 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:43.370
 now a sprinter and two techniques 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:45.380
 compare once the full 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:47.120
 squeeze through as if by analogy 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:48.830
 jumps out the player would lie down 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.780
 of course, the ball takes on so well 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:52.370
 fast pace and then the other 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:54.319
 technology that has just been presented 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:56.560
 where to pick up the tempo slowly in the 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:58.849
 at the beginning you are not fully absorbed and 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:00.260
 then submit as ball avoids and 

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:02.060
 Let's compare the times 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.680
 We start here at the midline and 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.540
 it stops at the height of 16 meters 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:07.160
 knew and we see this here now 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:09.470
 first example want to be fully absorbed 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.760
 at 938 start of the one sees that the 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:12.620
 play twice the ball strong 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.750
 submit as a control and then 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:16.040
 at 10 50 he arrives that's a time 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:18.049
 from one minute to twelve seconds 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:19.190
 Of course here the demo time was 

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:20.690
 not really a minute and now 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:22.970
 twelve seconds but much less 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:24.560
 and now we see the second example 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:25.070
 where we did not fully go through at the beginning 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:27.859
 to press 

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:29.120
 we start at 548 and you can see it 

00:03:27.859 --> 00:03:30.739
 player does not put the ball that far 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:33.049
 but still has dry pace yet 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:35.180
 recorded and arrives at 17 0 2 

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:36.709
 and that means one minute and 14 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:38.600
 seconds that is called on this route 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:40.130
 two seconds slower with this 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:42.250
 Of course not really two 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:44.959
 seconds but maybe a few 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:46.400
 millisecond slower and still has 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:48.049
 the player does not play the ball so hard 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.549
 had submitted had been present 

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:51.560
 so much more control over the 

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:53.780
 ball and that 's just this advantage 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:55.010
 The whole thing about this technique 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:56.299
 now here again just one 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:58.160
 show another example where to do that 

00:03:56.299 --> 00:03:59.630
 it looks pretty nice here 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:01.040
 for example, if you have an exit move 

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:02.480
 did and watched the ball 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:03.709
 far submits that would be almost with 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:06.139
 a lok sprint and here the same 

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:07.760
 for example with a lok sprint where you 

00:04:06.139 --> 00:04:08.840
 but also picks up speed 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:11.709
 not presented so far 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:14.480
 that was already the first part of 

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:16.220
 www.dfb.de 14 nm and I hope 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:18.470
 you liked it and we can do it 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:20.269
 also successfully apply in fifa 14 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:21.409
 we can imagine more 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:22.789
 to bring in this direction so of 

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:24.800
 this series of videos we are on your 

00:04:22.789 --> 00:04:26.810
 feedback curious if you like it 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:28.100
 has and if something is unclear 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:30.080
 really like this technique too 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:31.400
 Ask the comment section if 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:32.630
 her in which proposals have to 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:34.310
 both her and her help maybe 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:36.169
 needed fifa 14 or too 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:38.150
 mind you hey I'll do it now 

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:39.500
 fifa 14 otherwise it would be nice 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:42.080
 maybe that's the way it is 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:43.580
 something for this series of videos and that 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:45.320
 should have been now i hope so too 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:52.310
 it fell clean on the box clean 

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:53.870
 js hello and welcome to 

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:56.710
 another video for our channel 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:56.710
 like never
