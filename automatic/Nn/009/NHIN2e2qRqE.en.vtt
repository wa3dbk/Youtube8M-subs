00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.069
 hello and welcome to another review 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.670
 today we'll take a look at the action pussies 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:10.590
 of the playmates toys of the tmnt line 

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:13.170
 classic collection and in particular 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.690
 we will take a look at be bop which is part 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.690
 of the series 2 action figer was 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:21.500
 produced in 2014 and in 6 inches scale 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:25.130
 it is about 16 centimeters high 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:31.230
 here is how the packaging looks in front 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:33.000
 and on the back is perfectly identical to 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:38.280
 that of rocksteady so don't miss it 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:40.590
 more time on the box and be be bop 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.149
 out of the packaging I have to say that I do 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.120
 really like the look of be bop 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.920
 especially for converse shoes that 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.230
 I therefore madly love a character 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.020
 with these shoes it ca n't help but stay with me 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.460
 ultra nice also in this case the 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.860
 character's look has been revisited 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.590
 to look more badass 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:01.230
 rather more aggressive and less clumsy e 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:05.239
 comic I repeat this thing does not give me 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.239
 no nuisance I do not consider myself a purist 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:10.740
 a lot can also the rocksteady look 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:14.340
 with these purple and crest glasses 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:16.560
 I think I'm purple, too, I'm almost sure 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.540
 that he had a cartoon pigtail while 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.680
 in this case as you can see not 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.439
 has been eliminated 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.240
 I must say that this thing I do not like it 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:26.490
 one annoys enough why 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.810
 clearly a shortcut to do the 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.329
 pigtail could be enough 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.549
 annoying seen quite annoying 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:35.040
 list given the articulation here present 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:36.869
 in the neck then delete it 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.229
 completely is a shortcut that 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:41.729
 frankly it bothers me a little 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:43.350
 we have this ride in red that how 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.420
 you can see it carved is not a piece 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:48.060
 separated as well as all these pendants 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:51.119
 and this belt is all the pieces 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:56.509
 these bombs are also carved here on the 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:59.969
 gila these black bracelets with spikes 

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:02.070
 blue trousers with chain belts e 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:05.729
 as i said before e commerce a lot 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:07.150
 beautiful red with purple details is the 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:09.070
 obviously white tip 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:11.170
 we care to let me see how 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:13.720
 inside instead there are not there 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:14.590
 are some painting details 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.750
 this is another thing that me 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:18.070
 annoys me enough I do n't understand 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:21.180
 the meaning I don't see because outside 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:23.740
 should be painted inside no 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:26.200
 let's go back to this course 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:29.530
 very large indeed very much 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:33.640
 massive slightly curved forward and 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:37.990
 these these turtle shells on 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:39.100
 shoulders of separate pieces you see fine 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:41.320
 do not limit that much 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:44.920
 the articulation about 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:46.630
 head and ball joint though 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.180
 can practically only rotate and 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:51.580
 move his down slightly 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:54.070
 arm can rotate 360 ​​degrees to move 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:57.760
 in outside in part rotation 

00:02:54.070 --> 00:03:01.300
 high biceps double joint elbow a 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:03.340
 then rotation with zipper in the hand 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:05.920
 it can rotate and move up and up 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.780
 although he had a little hard rotation a 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:09.610
 ball joint ball in the middle 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:12.700
 of the course even if the range of movement 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:13.959
 and a little limited sphere also at the sides 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:18.310
 also here with a range of motion 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:20.410
 rather limited double to the knee and 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:22.209
 something rotation to the shoe 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:24.959
 I want you to notice the fact that it is 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:28.330
 let me take rocksteady 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:31.390
 I 'll show you see the legs are 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:33.400
 a scout is completely different there is the 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:36.010
 playmate has not reused the same 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:37.780
 scout the same body for both 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:40.450
 characters I have to say this is one 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:43.000
 ultra positive note because 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:46.030
 they could have done it easily 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.790
 given the similar the similarity between the two 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:50.350
 characters at least for the body for 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:51.970
 regarding the body 

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:53.890
 instead they didn't want to make it 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:55.350
 wanted to be bop a little more massive 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:57.360
 see that the muscular legs he has 

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:59.650
 compared to rocksteady 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:04.170
 as far as accessories are concerned 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:06.420
 we have the base here it is 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:08.370
 as for that of rocksteady this 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:10.920
 time sees the complete completely 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:13.380
 flat gray without shades of 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:15.090
 painting something that I must say I do not 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:18.570
 really like the character's name 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:20.220
 below is only one weapon then a 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:21.120
 rocksteady difference he had two 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:22.970
 weapons 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:28.220
 we have only this weapon this kind of 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:31.020
 rifle with soft plastic auger 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:33.510
 completely dark gray you see no 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:37.520
 detail also in this case to give 

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:37.520
 a retro touch to this action figures 

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:48.389
 and here is a nice shocking group of all e 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:50.970
 four turtles with rocksteady and 

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:52.460
 be bop really very beautiful these actions 

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:55.260
 figures all together 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:57.660
 to conclude, I confirm what I said 

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:59.040
 in the review of rocksteady and that is 

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:00.840
 that is rocksteady that be bop 

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:02.669
 certainly represent a step 

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:05.340
 back compared to what we saw with the 

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:06.660
 however, ninja turtles are still present 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:09.120
 rather than action figures 

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:11.250
 funny and that are definitely worth the 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:12.720
 price paid for the purchase 

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:15.450
 I personally bought them on 

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:18.300
 amazon.uk paying about 16 hours and 50 

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:20.039
 one shipped including shipping 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:22.289
 if I had to recommend a price I would say 

00:05:20.039 --> 00:05:24.240
 definitely not to go over 20 euros 

00:05:22.289 --> 00:05:25.950
 including shipping for each 

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:27.780
 character 

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:30.060
 having said that I greet you I hope that 

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:32.430
 you enjoyed this review and you 

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:34.580
 I make an appointment at the next video 

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:34.580
 Hello
