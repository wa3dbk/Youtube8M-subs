CT spawn so anyone trying to rotate

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.959 
CT spawn so anyone trying to rotate
through<00:00:37.200> that<00:00:37.410> will<00:00:38.070> be<00:00:38.190> completely<00:00:38.640> cut<00:00:38.940> off

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
through that will be completely cut off

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.389

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
the risk of actually going for it but

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.080 
the risk of actually going for it but
most<00:00:43.379> likely<00:00:43.559> dying<00:00:44.040> because<00:00:44.460> of<00:00:44.640> the<00:00:44.850> smoke

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090
