product called the smart scope to which

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:06.590 
product called the smart scope to which
these<00:00:04.589> two<00:00:04.799> monitors<00:00:05.250> you<00:00:05.400> see<00:00:05.609> in<00:00:05.759> this<00:00:05.910> red

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:06.600 
these two monitors you see in this red

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.509 
these two monitors you see in this red
configuration<00:00:07.319> right<00:00:07.649> here<00:00:07.919> and<00:00:08.099> they<00:00:08.400> are

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
configuration right here and they are

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:11.180 
configuration right here and they are
not<00:00:08.639> just<00:00:08.670> monitors<00:00:09.420> you<00:00:09.630> can<00:00:09.809> configure<00:00:10.410> both

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
not just monitors you can configure both

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.030 
not just monitors you can configure both
of<00:00:11.429> them<00:00:11.639> are<00:00:11.880> one<00:00:12.330> of<00:00:12.450> them<00:00:12.630> to<00:00:13.230> show<00:00:13.710> a

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
of them are one of them to show a

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.160 
of them are one of them to show a
technical<00:00:14.790> view<00:00:15.059> on<00:00:15.240> the<00:00:15.360> video<00:00:15.599> signal<00:00:15.839> and

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
technical view on the video signal and

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:17.930 
technical view on the video signal and
the<00:00:16.619> way<00:00:16.770> you<00:00:16.830> do<00:00:17.039> it<00:00:17.190> is<00:00:17.340> you<00:00:17.369> use<00:00:17.730> the

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
the way you do it is you use the

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.870 
the way you do it is you use the
software<00:00:18.390> which<00:00:18.779> follows<00:00:19.740> the<00:00:19.980> product<00:00:20.310> so

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
software which follows the product so

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.939 
software which follows the product so
Blackmagic<00:00:21.810> made<00:00:22.020> this<00:00:22.170> application<00:00:22.800> for

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
Blackmagic made this application for

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.150 
Blackmagic made this application for
your<00:00:23.010> laptop<00:00:23.250> a<00:00:23.760> Mac<00:00:24.359> or<00:00:24.510> PC<00:00:24.539> and<00:00:25.140> using<00:00:25.980> this

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
your laptop a Mac or PC and using this

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.400 
your laptop a Mac or PC and using this
you<00:00:26.340> can<00:00:26.550> now<00:00:26.670> change<00:00:26.939> the<00:00:27.210> one

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
you can now change the one

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.669 
you can now change the one
maneet<00:00:29.070> set<00:00:29.250> to<00:00:29.369> show<00:00:29.609> a<00:00:30.179> waveform<00:00:31.140> or<00:00:31.380> some

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
maneet set to show a waveform or some

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.209 
maneet set to show a waveform or some
other<00:00:31.920> kind<00:00:32.309> of<00:00:33.020> scope<00:00:34.020> showing<00:00:34.680> the<00:00:34.829> the

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
other kind of scope showing the the

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.180 
other kind of scope showing the the
technical<00:00:35.760> details<00:00:36.210> of<00:00:36.420> the<00:00:36.540> video<00:00:36.780> signal

technical details of the video signal

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:39.650 
technical details of the video signal
okay<00:00:38.190> one<00:00:38.430> of<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:38.670> drawbacks<00:00:39.000> of<00:00:39.480> this

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
okay one of the drawbacks of this

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.139 
okay one of the drawbacks of this
product<00:00:40.079> is<00:00:40.200> that<00:00:40.379> it's<00:00:40.590> hooked<00:00:41.520> up<00:00:41.730> with<00:00:41.910> the

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
product is that it's hooked up with the

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.779 
product is that it's hooked up with the
software<00:00:42.480> panel<00:00:42.930> only<00:00:43.260> there's<00:00:43.950> no<00:00:44.219> hardware

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
software panel only there's no hardware

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.450 
software panel only there's no hardware
control<00:00:45.270> to<00:00:45.570> do<00:00:45.719> this<00:00:45.930> in<00:00:46.110> the<00:00:46.230> field<00:00:46.440> so<00:00:47.070> we

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
control to do this in the field so we

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.930 
control to do this in the field so we
developed<00:00:48.239> that<00:00:48.360> of<00:00:48.480> course<00:00:48.750> and<00:00:49.730> the<00:00:50.730> way<00:00:50.879> you

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
developed that of course and the way you

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.610 
developed that of course and the way you
communicate<00:00:51.600> with<00:00:51.750> the<00:00:51.870> monitors<00:00:52.320> are

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
communicate with the monitors are

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.860 
communicate with the monitors are
through<00:00:52.860> Ethernet<00:00:53.370> and<00:00:53.489> we<00:00:54.030> made<00:00:54.600> a<00:00:54.629> few

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
through Ethernet and we made a few

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.770 
through Ethernet and we made a few
hardware<00:00:55.289> solutions<00:00:55.829> or<00:00:55.980> examples<00:00:56.969> really<00:00:57.390> on

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
hardware solutions or examples really on

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.119 
hardware solutions or examples really on
how<00:00:58.320> you<00:00:58.379> can<00:00:58.649> do<00:00:58.829> it<00:00:59.090> so<00:01:00.090> we<00:01:00.870> have<00:01:01.079> this<00:01:01.890> one

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
how you can do it so we have this one

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.429 
how you can do it so we have this one
which<00:01:02.370> is<00:01:02.609> one<00:01:02.850> extreme<00:01:03.329> it's<00:01:03.570> developed

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
which is one extreme it's developed

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.350 
which is one extreme it's developed
specifically<00:01:05.070> for<00:01:05.189> a<00:01:05.400> customer<00:01:05.880> designed

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
specifically for a customer designed

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.289 
specifically for a customer designed
with<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:06.720> customer<00:01:07.200> to<00:01:07.890> be<00:01:07.920> a<00:01:08.310> field<00:01:08.850> operated

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
with the customer to be a field operated

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.450 
with the customer to be a field operated
device<00:01:09.720> using<00:01:10.229> a<00:01:10.350> battery<00:01:10.590> inside<00:01:11.040> and<00:01:11.340> then

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
device using a battery inside and then

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:12.920 
device using a battery inside and then
we<00:01:11.580> have<00:01:11.729> these<00:01:12.000> which<00:01:12.270> are<00:01:12.479> far<00:01:12.900> more

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
we have these which are far more

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.850 
we have these which are far more
integrated<00:01:13.799> where<00:01:14.040> actually<00:01:14.790> their<00:01:15.330> main

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:15.860 
integrated where actually their main

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:18.740 
integrated where actually their main
function<00:01:16.860> is<00:01:17.009> to<00:01:17.070> operate<00:01:17.729> an<00:01:17.909> ATM<00:01:18.299> switcher

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
function is to operate an ATM switcher

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.830 
function is to operate an ATM switcher
but<00:01:19.290> you<00:01:19.439> can<00:01:19.590> also<00:01:19.880> enable<00:01:20.880> scope<00:01:21.330> mode<00:01:21.600> and

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
but you can also enable scope mode and

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.719 
but you can also enable scope mode and
I'll<00:01:22.110> show<00:01:22.350> you<00:01:22.409> that<00:01:22.650> in<00:01:22.860> just<00:01:23.130> a<00:01:23.220> bit<00:01:23.340> so

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
I'll show you that in just a bit so

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.640 
I'll show you that in just a bit so
let's<00:01:23.909> take<00:01:24.060> a<00:01:24.090> look<00:01:24.270> at<00:01:24.420> this<00:01:24.659> one<00:01:24.900> now<00:01:25.080> this

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
let's take a look at this one now this

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.580 
let's take a look at this one now this
is<00:01:25.770> really<00:01:26.040> a<00:01:26.189> nice<00:01:26.369> little<00:01:26.640> device<00:01:27.080> you<00:01:28.080> just

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
is really a nice little device you just

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.710 
is really a nice little device you just
connect<00:01:28.950> the<00:01:29.310> ethernet<00:01:29.460> here<00:01:29.970> and<00:01:30.180> the

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
connect the ethernet here and the

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.990 
connect the ethernet here and the
customer<00:01:31.140> requested<00:01:32.070> that<00:01:32.250> he<00:01:32.400> could<00:01:32.579> control

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
customer requested that he could control

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.210 
customer requested that he could control
up<00:01:33.240> to<00:01:33.420> three<00:01:33.720> different<00:01:33.960> scopes<00:01:34.530> so<00:01:35.040> we

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
up to three different scopes so we

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.819 
up to three different scopes so we
programmed<00:01:35.790> our<00:01:36.299> scope<00:01:36.689> IP<00:01:36.930> addresses<00:01:37.560> onto

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
programmed our scope IP addresses onto

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.160 
programmed our scope IP addresses onto
these<00:01:37.950> buttons<00:01:38.369> now<00:01:38.850> scope<00:01:39.570> number<00:01:39.900> one

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
these buttons now scope number one

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.140 
these buttons now scope number one
corresponds<00:01:40.890> to<00:01:40.950> the<00:01:41.130> IP<00:01:41.310> address<00:01:41.790> of<00:01:41.939> this

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
corresponds to the IP address of this

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.639 
corresponds to the IP address of this
particular<00:01:42.570> scopes<00:01:43.020> and<00:01:43.140> when<00:01:43.259> I<00:01:43.290> press<00:01:43.619> that

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
particular scopes and when I press that

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.950 
particular scopes and when I press that
you<00:01:43.950> can<00:01:44.100> now<00:01:44.250> see<00:01:44.549> it's<00:01:45.060> confirmed<00:01:45.630> that<00:01:45.750> we

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
you can now see it's confirmed that we

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.870 
you can now see it's confirmed that we
have<00:01:46.079> a<00:01:46.110> connection<00:01:46.439> to<00:01:46.740> this<00:01:46.860> one<00:01:47.070> and<00:01:47.250> that

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
have a connection to this one and that

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.210 
have a connection to this one and that
means<00:01:48.149> if<00:01:48.450> we<00:01:48.930> push<00:01:49.170> these<00:01:49.350> buttons<00:01:49.770> up<00:01:49.920> and

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
means if we push these buttons up and

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.910 
means if we push these buttons up and
down<00:01:50.399> we<00:01:50.970> can<00:01:51.180> now<00:01:51.210> cycle<00:01:51.930> the<00:01:52.110> modes<00:01:52.380> of<00:01:52.740> the

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
down we can now cycle the modes of the

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.109 
down we can now cycle the modes of the
scope<00:01:53.250> over<00:01:53.460> here<00:01:54.950> right<00:01:55.950> and<00:01:56.369> we<00:01:56.490> can<00:01:56.640> also<00:01:56.790> go

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
scope over here right and we can also go

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.760 
scope over here right and we can also go
the<00:01:57.149> other<00:01:57.450> way<00:01:58.219> like<00:01:59.219> you<00:01:59.369> see<00:01:59.610> here<00:02:00.530> okay<00:02:01.530> so

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
the other way like you see here okay so

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.370

this is a very typical application of
sky-high<00:03:05.319> products<00:03:06.010> because<00:03:06.400> we<00:03:06.580> can

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:06.730 
sky-high products because we can

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:08.970 
sky-high products because we can
integrate<00:03:07.120> control<00:03:07.780> of<00:03:07.930> multiple<00:03:08.260> hardware

devices in the same physical device that

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:13.970 
devices in the same physical device that
makes<00:03:11.799> it<00:03:11.980> easy<00:03:12.250> to<00:03:12.580> create<00:03:12.959> user-friendly

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
makes it easy to create user-friendly

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.070 
makes it easy to create user-friendly
interfaces<00:03:14.980> because<00:03:15.880> you<00:03:16.090> have<00:03:16.299> all<00:03:16.599> the

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:17.080 
interfaces because you have all the

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:18.870 
interfaces because you have all the
buttons<00:03:17.410> at<00:03:17.650> the<00:03:17.980> same<00:03:18.160> place<00:03:18.459> designed

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:18.880 
buttons at the same place designed

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.990 
buttons at the same place designed
exactly<00:03:19.540> like<00:03:19.690> you<00:03:19.840> wanted<00:03:20.200> the<00:03:21.040> one<00:03:21.250> below<00:03:21.640> is

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
exactly like you wanted the one below is

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.080 
exactly like you wanted the one below is
an<00:03:22.420> example<00:03:22.750> of<00:03:23.410> basically<00:03:24.370> the<00:03:24.519> same<00:03:24.760> but<00:03:24.970> in

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.090 
an example of basically the same but in

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:27.120 
an example of basically the same but in
a<00:03:25.180> slightly<00:03:25.329> different<00:03:25.720> enclosure<00:03:26.380> is<00:03:26.650> still

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:27.130 
a slightly different enclosure is still

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:30.330 
a slightly different enclosure is still
de<00:03:27.400> 21<00:03:28.299> enclosure<00:03:28.780> type<00:03:29.140> but<00:03:29.890> as<00:03:30.010> you<00:03:30.160> can<00:03:30.280> see

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.340 
de 21 enclosure type but as you can see

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:32.130 
de 21 enclosure type but as you can see
we<00:03:30.640> have<00:03:30.790> different<00:03:30.940> layout<00:03:31.510> of<00:03:31.660> buttons<00:03:31.989> etc

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:32.140 
we have different layout of buttons etc

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:34.590 
we have different layout of buttons etc
so<00:03:32.920> there's<00:03:33.160> a<00:03:33.280> lot<00:03:33.459> of<00:03:33.579> flexibility<00:03:34.150> you<00:03:34.269> can

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:34.600 
so there's a lot of flexibility you can

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:37.410 
so there's a lot of flexibility you can
obtain<00:03:35.079> using<00:03:35.890> these<00:03:36.340> modules<00:03:37.239> and

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:37.420 
obtain using these modules and

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:41.870 
obtain using these modules and
enclosures

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.940
