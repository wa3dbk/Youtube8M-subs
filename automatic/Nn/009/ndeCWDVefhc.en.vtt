surprised but someone who has so much

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:40.720 
surprised but someone who has so much
going<00:02:38.810> on<00:02:39.140> their<00:02:39.320> lives<00:02:39.590> it's<00:02:40.160> kind<00:02:40.340> of<00:02:40.459> hard

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
going on their lives it's kind of hard

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:42.699 
going on their lives it's kind of hard
to<00:02:40.820> you<00:02:41.120> know<00:02:41.150> actually<00:02:41.510> go<00:02:41.989> out<00:02:42.140> and<00:02:42.170> do<00:02:42.530> your

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:42.709 
to you know actually go out and do your

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:45.310 
to you know actually go out and do your
thing<00:02:42.739> so<00:02:43.250> when<00:02:44.180> pro<00:02:44.420> day<00:02:44.600> comes<00:02:44.930> when<00:02:45.230> he

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:45.320 
thing so when pro day comes when he

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:46.870 
thing so when pro day comes when he
actually<00:02:45.470> gets<00:02:45.739> the<00:02:45.920> second<00:02:46.310> opportunity<00:02:46.579> to

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:46.880 
actually gets the second opportunity to

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:48.610 
actually gets the second opportunity to
prove<00:02:47.090> to<00:02:47.299> the<00:02:47.390> crowd<00:02:47.660> what<00:02:48.230> he<00:02:48.320> can<00:02:48.470> do<00:02:48.590> I

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
prove to the crowd what he can do I

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:49.930 
prove to the crowd what he can do I
think<00:02:48.799> he'll<00:02:49.100> make<00:02:49.220> most<00:02:49.430> of<00:02:49.579> it<00:02:49.730> and<00:02:49.850> also

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:49.940 
think he'll make most of it and also

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.180 
think he'll make most of it and also
Tyrann<00:02:50.450> Mathieu<00:02:50.480> I<00:02:51.140> think<00:02:51.650> he<00:02:51.709> is<00:02:51.739> deafening

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.190 
Tyrann Mathieu I think he is deafening

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:55.090 
Tyrann Mathieu I think he is deafening
to<00:02:52.280> be<00:02:52.400> probably<00:02:52.910> a<00:02:53.000> steal<00:02:53.299> an<00:02:53.420> NFL<00:02:53.900> draft<00:02:54.320> it's

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:55.100

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:56.410 
to be probably a steal an NFL draft it's
just<00:02:55.250> gonna<00:02:55.370> be<00:02:55.459> pretty<00:02:55.670> interesting<00:02:56.090> to<00:02:56.209> see

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420

where<00:02:56.750> he<00:02:57.019> goes<00:02:57.230> in<00:02:57.560> a<00:02:57.620> draft<00:02:57.890> but<00:02:58.100> the<00:02:58.160> only

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280 
where he goes in a draft but the only

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.099 
where he goes in a draft but the only
thing<00:02:58.400> is<00:02:58.760> I<00:02:58.970> just<00:02:59.329> don't<00:02:59.690> know<00:02:59.810> if<00:02:59.930> I'm<00:03:00.019> going
