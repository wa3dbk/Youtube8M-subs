 transparent lip gloss with light 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:17.469

 spending a lot of time and effort 

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:31.539
 and not having professional skills 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:35.170
 moisten the lips to add volume to the lips and 

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:39.119

 he is a friend of light corrector 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:07.880
 if we still want to get a clear 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:12.170
 contour of the lips while slightly changing 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:14.480
 form up is better 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:18.280
 just take a pencil of natural color 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:21.200
 almost light lips and slightly slightly 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:24.820
 increase sponge but increase should 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.820
 be no more than one millimeter 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:39.760

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:41.440
 by using this feathering i 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:44.640
 feather contour 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.640
 inside the lips 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:52.260
 be sure to apply the contour on 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.810
 lips when we use lipstick because 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:59.510
 that you will never succeed beautifully and 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:59.510
 clearly draw lips without a pencil 

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:12.819

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:16.050
 doctor new lip gloss with easy 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:18.700
 berry shade and already on top of lipstick 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:20.740
 I will now shine a little 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:23.280
 change the color of lipstick it will be a little 

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:27.030
 brighter lips will 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:28.950
 glossy more shiny more 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:31.900
 seductive 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:35.820
 there will be a light berry shade your 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:41.160
 splint and due to the glossy effect 

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:43.720

 used red lipstick but me 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:51.540

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:54.100
 lipstick goes to everybody but every woman 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:56.350
 your shade of red lipstick 

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:58.780
 It seems to me that this will go very well 

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:01.800
 pure neutral red red 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:05.770
 lipstick she very strongly obliges 

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:08.910
 so you need to be very careful about 

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:08.910
 draw lip contour 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:16.200

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:31.310
 Now you need to shade red to 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:31.310
 went inside necessarily 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:40.140
 very carefully about painting lips and in 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:43.590
 throughout the day make sure that 

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:46.200

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:52.770
 look at the mirrors and correct 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:55.200
 if you want your lipstick 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:57.000
 kept longer yes that is strengthen 

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:59.190
 there are a lot of things 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:04.260
 makeup artist kih secrets but one of them 

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:06.420
 such that you can get a little wet only 

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:13.910
 at this moment do not smudge lipstick 

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:20.420
 then take on the brush powder again 

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:25.660
 attach neatly and lips, as it were 

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:25.660
 punch through the napkin where 

00:05:27.039 --> 00:05:30.710
 neatly 

00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:30.710
 take off 

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:40.250
 then duplicate again if 

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:44.040
 you want to have matte lips you can again 

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:47.150
 blotted with a napkin and the color of the lips will become 

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:47.150
 more dull 

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:54.830
 if the opposite 

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:57.800
 you want to have glossy lips with varnish 

00:05:54.830 --> 00:06:01.480
 the effect then you need to use 

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:01.480
 extra lip gloss 

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:19.310
 if this is a girl of spring color type 

00:06:16.599 --> 00:06:21.319
 light wheat blonde hair 

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:23.720
 With bright eyes, it is likely to be here. 

00:06:21.319 --> 00:06:24.319
 need to use unclean red 

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:26.620
 lipstick 

00:06:24.319 --> 00:06:30.050
 a slightly muffled slightly 

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:32.960
 fitted and also such a growth 

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:35.750
 as I am also not recommended to use 

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:37.909
 very bright red lipstick you need such 

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:40.479
 slightly muffled in u with cold smoke 

00:06:37.909 --> 00:06:40.479
 shade 

00:06:42.339 --> 00:06:48.110
 like that knowing the secrets of the professionals 

00:06:45.439 --> 00:06:50.949
 you can change the shape of the lips and tame 

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:50.949
 red lipstick
