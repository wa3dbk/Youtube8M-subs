00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.099 
started by taking a 16 inch sterling
silver<00:00:17.369> Rolo<00:00:17.670> chain<00:00:17.699> which<00:00:18.240> we<00:00:18.390> carry<00:00:18.660> in<00:00:18.930> both

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
16 18 and 20 inches and I cut a piece

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:23.929 
16 18 and 20 inches and I cut a piece
out<00:00:22.710> of<00:00:22.890> it<00:00:23.010> because<00:00:23.340> something<00:00:23.670> you<00:00:23.730> want<00:00:23.910> to

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
out of it because something you want to

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.550 
out of it because something you want to
keep<00:00:24.060> in<00:00:24.180> mind<00:00:24.390> is<00:00:24.510> whatever<00:00:24.720> you're<00:00:25.050> beating

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
keep in mind is whatever you're beating

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.980 
keep in mind is whatever you're beating
into<00:00:25.859> the<00:00:25.949> chain<00:00:26.189> is<00:00:26.460> going<00:00:26.849> to<00:00:26.910> add<00:00:27.029> length<00:00:27.359> so

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
into the chain is going to add length so

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.960 
into the chain is going to add length so
if<00:00:28.170> you<00:00:28.320> don't<00:00:28.560> want<00:00:28.800> it<00:00:28.890> to<00:00:29.010> be<00:00:29.130> more<00:00:29.400> than<00:00:29.580> 16

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
if you don't want it to be more than 16

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.490 
if you don't want it to be more than 16
inches<00:00:30.210> you<00:00:30.330> have<00:00:30.480> to<00:00:30.599> cut<00:00:30.810> some<00:00:31.140> of<00:00:31.260> the<00:00:31.349> links

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
inches you have to cut some of the links

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.319 
inches you have to cut some of the links
out<00:00:31.710> so<00:00:31.949> I've<00:00:32.099> cut<00:00:32.340> out<00:00:32.460> about<00:00:33.030> a<00:00:33.090> two<00:00:33.300> inch

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
out so I've cut out about a two inch

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.569 
out so I've cut out about a two inch
piece<00:00:33.719> of<00:00:34.079> chain<00:00:34.680> which<00:00:34.860> I<00:00:34.980> can<00:00:35.130> now<00:00:35.160> use<00:00:35.430> for

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
piece of chain which I can now use for

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:36.740 
piece of chain which I can now use for
something<00:00:35.880> else<00:00:36.000> I<00:00:36.120> could<00:00:36.270> make<00:00:36.420> matching

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
something else I could make matching

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.690 
something else I could make matching
earrings<00:00:36.989> with<00:00:37.110> it<00:00:37.230> if<00:00:37.290> I<00:00:37.380> want<00:00:37.620> so<00:00:38.520> right<00:00:38.670> now

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
earrings with it if I want so right now

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.970 
earrings with it if I want so right now
I<00:00:38.850> have<00:00:39.030> a<00:00:39.059> 14<00:00:39.600> inch<00:00:39.629> chain<00:00:40.079> here<00:00:40.440> that's<00:00:40.800> going

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
I have a 14 inch chain here that's going

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.650 
I have a 14 inch chain here that's going
to<00:00:41.070> end<00:00:41.100> up<00:00:41.309> becoming<00:00:41.820> a<00:00:42.149> little<00:00:42.360> bit<00:00:42.480> longer

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
to end up becoming a little bit longer

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.479 
to end up becoming a little bit longer
it'll<00:00:42.899> probably<00:00:43.079> go<00:00:43.230> back<00:00:43.379> up<00:00:43.590> to<00:00:43.739> about<00:00:43.950> a<00:00:44.010> 16

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
it'll probably go back up to about a 16

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.330 
it'll probably go back up to about a 16
so<00:00:45.360> I'm<00:00:45.420> going<00:00:45.480> to<00:00:45.690> start<00:00:45.930> by<00:00:46.020> taking<00:00:46.350> some

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
so I'm going to start by taking some

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.940 
so I'm going to start by taking some
soft<00:00:47.579> like<00:00:47.760> beading<00:00:48.120> wire<00:00:48.440> going<00:00:49.440> to<00:00:49.530> take<00:00:49.739> my

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
soft like beading wire going to take my

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.389 
soft like beading wire going to take my
crimp<00:00:50.399> bead<00:00:50.550> I'm<00:00:51.289> going<00:00:52.289> to<00:00:52.379> crimp<00:00:52.710> on<00:00:52.890> to<00:00:53.250> the

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
crimp bead I'm going to crimp on to the

00:00:53.399 --> 00:01:01.840 
crimp bead I'm going to crimp on to the
end<00:00:53.550> link<00:00:53.879> of<00:00:54.180> the<00:00:54.600> chain

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:01.850 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:09.560 

like<00:01:02.850> so

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.330 

and<00:01:10.110> I<00:01:10.170> think<00:01:10.380> it's<00:01:10.470> really<00:01:10.530> important<00:01:11.159> to<00:01:11.190> use

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
and I think it's really important to use

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.790 
and I think it's really important to use
crimp<00:01:11.610> covers<00:01:11.880> especially<00:01:12.750> in<00:01:12.900> this<00:01:13.409> kind<00:01:13.710> of

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:13.800 
crimp covers especially in this kind of

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.160 
crimp covers especially in this kind of
a<00:01:13.890> situation<00:01:14.070> because<00:01:14.729> our<00:01:15.630> crimps<00:01:15.960> are<00:01:16.050> going

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
a situation because our crimps are going

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.390 
a situation because our crimps are going
to<00:01:16.229> be<00:01:16.320> towards<00:01:16.620> the<00:01:16.710> front<00:01:16.920> of<00:01:17.010> the<00:01:17.130> necklace

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
to be towards the front of the necklace

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.440 
to be towards the front of the necklace
so<00:01:17.490> they're<00:01:17.610> going<00:01:17.700> to<00:01:17.790> be<00:01:17.880> much<00:01:18.060> more<00:01:18.090> visible

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
so they're going to be much more visible

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.540 
so they're going to be much more visible
so<00:01:19.260> it's<00:01:19.440> always<00:01:19.740> nice<00:01:19.950> to<00:01:19.979> be<00:01:20.220> able<00:01:20.310> to

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:20.550 
so it's always nice to be able to

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:23.359 
so it's always nice to be able to
camouflage<00:01:21.090> them<00:01:21.890> and<00:01:22.890> make<00:01:23.070> them<00:01:23.220> look<00:01:23.280> like

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
camouflage them and make them look like

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.000 
camouflage them and make them look like
a<00:01:23.490> filler<00:01:23.760> of<00:01:23.970> sterling<00:01:24.360> silver<00:01:24.390> bead<00:01:24.830> so<00:01:25.830> now
