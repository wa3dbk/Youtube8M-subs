00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:11.519
 Nine people get to this new one 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:14.070
 sequence of lego breakdance number one by 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:17.100
 kinzler after a longer break, there you go 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.720
 Finally , yes, as you can see 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.670
 I already have the gondolas 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:24.570
 Almost all have begun 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:27.210
 and I'll show you just me now 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.640
 take off the times in close-up 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.170
 to show 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:34.290
 the basic part consists of these 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:36.149
 diagonally stone and I have then stop 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.930
 connected at the top 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:42.930
 on the front is such a plate as a 6 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.640
 wide and three long, yes the whole 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.710
 a total of six wide and become easy 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.660
 then put on it and turn around 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.879
 beautiful on the gondola cross it cross 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.250
 itself turns well and the 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.809
 Gondolas swing well too 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:57.719
 let's get to the next one that would be the one 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:00.690
 I have that diamond so far now 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:03.449
 The basic idea comes from the fair 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.830
 live by the diamonds have determined 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.600
 many of you have seen 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.070
 I have just was not space 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.140
 with the typical kinzler seem 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.210
 Headlamps set underneath and the 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.780
 changed colors where the lamps are on 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.939
 so in gold and green the typical 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.430
 colors of the kinzler otherwise he is 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:23.360
 I'll have that next 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.360
 kasseler out 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:29.830
 You can see that with the door 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:37.300
 Colors are still changing a bit 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:39.700
 I still miss one part of 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:41.560
 behind so swivel music system 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.930
 computer the whole control of 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:46.480
 breakdance with pizza and a little one 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:49.650
 coffee machine I have installed there so 

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:52.630
 as a little comics on second glance 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:55.150
 yes and then I still have a part of the 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:57.310
 outside wreath so this black and white 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:58.780
 edge of the plate I have now the 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:00.400
 just gondolas on the floor 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.470
 put to you just the choice 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.550
 to show 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:06.880
 I can get out of there myself 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:09.670
 two times two plates built by lego 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:13.209
 always in black and white alternating and at the 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:15.760
 corners are these four long oblique 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:19.260
 stones or wing plates are called the 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:21.850
 I think here you see such a time 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.800
 yes that was it already then 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:27.420
