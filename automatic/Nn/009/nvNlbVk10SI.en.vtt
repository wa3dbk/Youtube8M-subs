in the game this game Warwick in my

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.889 
in the game this game Warwick in my
opinion<00:02:04.710> carried<00:02:05.040> I<00:02:05.420> mean<00:02:06.420> it<00:02:06.540> goes<00:02:06.659> for<00:02:06.840> that

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
opinion carried I mean it goes for that

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.109 
opinion carried I mean it goes for that
I<00:02:06.960> mean<00:02:07.170> off<00:02:07.469> stats<00:02:07.890> alone<00:02:08.250> like<00:02:08.580> 1000<00:02:08.849> and<00:02:08.970> 5

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
I mean off stats alone like 1000 and 5

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.370 
I mean off stats alone like 1000 and 5
you<00:02:09.629> know<00:02:09.750> having<00:02:10.110> great<00:02:10.289> stats<00:02:10.590> isn't

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:11.380 
you know having great stats isn't

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:14.880 
you know having great stats isn't
early<00:02:11.650> like<00:02:11.890> a<00:02:13.230> guarantee<00:02:14.230> like<00:02:14.470> this<00:02:14.710> guy

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
early like a guarantee like this guy

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:16.890 
early like a guarantee like this guy
carried<00:02:15.310> the<00:02:15.430> game<00:02:15.580> it<00:02:15.880> is<00:02:16.300> it<00:02:16.510> can<00:02:16.750> be<00:02:16.870> a

the champions and the damage taken it's

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:40.110 
the champions and the damage taken it's
normally<00:02:38.950> a<00:02:38.980> pretty<00:02:39.220> good<00:02:39.460> indicator<00:02:39.910> of

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
normally a pretty good indicator of

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:44.430 
normally a pretty good indicator of

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:15.520 
stood and then second look at your

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:17.160 
stood and then second look at your
damage<00:03:15.850> Delta<00:03:16.120> champs<00:03:16.480> and<00:03:16.630> your<00:03:16.870> damage

damage Delta champs and your damage

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:20.550 
damage Delta champs and your damage
taken<00:03:17.590> what<00:03:18.250> that'll<00:03:18.490> do<00:03:18.700> is<00:03:19.530> that<00:03:20.530> will

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:20.560 
taken what that'll do is that will

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.200 
taken what that'll do is that will
basically<00:03:20.920> I'm<00:03:21.460> not<00:03:21.610> even<00:03:21.790> going<00:03:21.910> to<00:03:21.970> read<00:03:22.090> it

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:22.210 
basically I'm not even going to read it

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:23.340 
basically I'm not even going to read it
dude<00:03:22.360> because<00:03:22.540> this<00:03:22.660> is<00:03:22.750> completely<00:03:23.200> retarded

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:23.350 
dude because this is completely retarded

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:25.410 
dude because this is completely retarded
it's<00:03:24.160> completely<00:03:24.640> retarded<00:03:25.000> to<00:03:25.090> come<00:03:25.210> in<00:03:25.300> here

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:25.420 
it's completely retarded to come in here

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:26.700 
it's completely retarded to come in here
and<00:03:25.540> try<00:03:25.630> to<00:03:25.660> justify<00:03:26.110> your<00:03:26.200> attitude<00:03:26.590> your

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:28.080 
attitude is completely ridiculous and

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:31.560 
attitude is completely ridiculous and
it's<00:03:29.080> part<00:03:29.380> of<00:03:29.440> the<00:03:29.530> reason<00:03:29.800> why<00:03:30.010> this<00:03:30.910> game<00:03:31.420> is

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:31.570 
it's part of the reason why this game is

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:33.930 
it's part of the reason why this game is
so<00:03:31.720> shitty<00:03:31.990> is<00:03:32.200> because<00:03:32.470> nobody<00:03:33.010> everyone<00:03:33.820> is

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:33.940 
so shitty is because nobody everyone is

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:36.600 
so shitty is because nobody everyone is
so<00:03:34.090> quick<00:03:34.330> to<00:03:34.540> report<00:03:35.500> people<00:03:35.650> for<00:03:36.130> perceive

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:36.610 
so quick to report people for perceive

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:37.950 
so quick to report people for perceive
toxicity<00:03:37.210> and<00:03:37.390> all<00:03:37.450> that<00:03:37.600> when<00:03:37.750> they<00:03:37.810> don't

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:37.960 
toxicity and all that when they don't

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:39.900 
toxicity and all that when they don't
even<00:03:38.050> use<00:03:38.170> logic<00:03:38.680> or<00:03:38.800> reason<00:03:39.130> for<00:03:39.580> half<00:03:39.760> of

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:39.910 
even use logic or reason for half of

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:43.170 
even use logic or reason for half of
their<00:03:40.030> arguments<00:03:40.540> and<00:03:41.440> here's<00:03:42.430> just<00:03:42.760> a<00:03:42.850> prime

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:43.180 
their arguments and here's just a prime

like<00:04:57.570> damning<00:04:58.570> for<00:04:58.600> somebody<00:04:59.080> but<00:04:59.590> it<00:04:59.680> is<00:04:59.830> here

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:00.190 
like damning for somebody but it is here

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:02.400 
like damning for somebody but it is here
because<00:05:00.790> your<00:05:00.940> stats<00:05:01.210> on<00:05:01.420> the<00:05:01.660> under<00:05:02.050> damage

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:02.410 
because your stats on the under damage

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:03.960 
because your stats on the under damage
dealt<00:05:02.590> sucks<00:05:02.920> so<00:05:03.130> much<00:05:03.160> that<00:05:03.550> that<00:05:03.640> basically

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:03.970 
dealt sucks so much that that basically

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:05.880 
dealt sucks so much that that basically
means<00:05:04.240> you<00:05:04.450> are<00:05:04.480> unable<00:05:04.750> to<00:05:04.960> ever<00:05:05.410> land<00:05:05.740> a

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:05.890 
means you are unable to ever land a

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:08.580 
means you are unable to ever land a
combo<00:05:06.280> the<00:05:06.430> entire<00:05:06.790> game<00:05:07.290> essentially<00:05:08.290> saying

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:08.590 
combo the entire game essentially saying

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:11.130 
combo the entire game essentially saying
you<00:05:08.710> have<00:05:09.010> you<00:05:09.670> lack<00:05:10.030> this<00:05:10.240> basic<00:05:10.690> proficiency

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:11.140 
you have you lack this basic proficiency

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:16.740 
you have you lack this basic proficiency
on<00:05:11.290> at<00:05:11.500> least<00:05:11.650> completely<00:05:12.720> um<00:05:15.360> yeah<00:05:16.360> I<00:05:16.390> mean<00:05:16.690> I

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:16.750 
on at least completely um yeah I mean I

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:18.570 
on at least completely um yeah I mean I

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:18.580 
just I just find it really humorous

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:19.800 
just I just find it really humorous
because<00:05:18.760> there's<00:05:19.060> plenty<00:05:19.150> of<00:05:19.330> people<00:05:19.660> like

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:19.810 
because there's plenty of people like
