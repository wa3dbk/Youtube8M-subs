00:00:01.210 --> 00:00:05.630
 Welcome to the second part of my 

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:07.210
 small euro while walking her degree 

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:09.340
 to rule 

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:12.130
 We just hope to continue 

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:16.420
 were just at aig that was the last one 

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:16.420
 visit and now I would like it 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:22.080
 lined direction through the hammer to 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:25.330
 new yamaha mid-engine installed 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.800
 I would show it for a short time and also 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:28.480
 a new engine the one 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.640
 own development is in I have 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:33.790
 the extra energy test hazard was the 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:35.140
 quite strong up could still 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:37.660
 be controlled a bit more harmoniously 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:40.720
 So a bit pushy always the 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:42.220
 support but still as I said 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:45.280
 we see a pretty power package here 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:46.720
 right now I'm coming to it too 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:51.820
 newer from the design quite new 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:53.409
 great battery but definitely good 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:55.780
 with the beautiful features of one 

00:00:53.409 --> 00:00:57.000
 direct runners quietly good direct 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:03.489
 power transmission 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:10.000
 nice thing is the yamaha mid-engine 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:11.799
 It is exactly to see here and in the case of Giant it is 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.780
 so you build the battery yourself 

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:15.970
 that is, they only take over the engine 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:17.140
 if I understood correctly what 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:19.330
 at the moment a little bit more leads to it 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:21.369
 that the vote altogether is not so 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:23.679
 and is she my medium engine 

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:26.020
 normally you're used to it 

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:27.700
 a little bit the feeling that occurs 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:29.380
 not quite round so then always clicks 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:32.320
 if you enter a correct one 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:34.409
 relapsing can and then pulled it again 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:36.549
 briefly away 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.530
 I drove the sco trainer 

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:39.969
 but somehow look nice from time to time 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:44.759
 I find a bit stronger colors 

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:44.759
 always great 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:49.710
 the second manufacturer of the also 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:53.080
 yamaha mid-engine is installed like nora 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:55.299
 I drove him there and found it 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.770
 him actually much more harmonious that 

00:01:55.299 --> 00:01:58.000
 is partly because that the 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:03.810
 complete set block 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.810
 that can be seen here 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:19.930
 also the new trans ex 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:19.930
 medium motor 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:34.609
 trans extreme vendor future is 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.500
 okay i found a good mid engine 

00:02:34.609 --> 00:02:40.519
 but now nothing is where I say 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:42.349
 you would have necessarily driven 

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:44.269
 but I turn around wrong again 

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:46.430
 direction got to flyer flyer 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:48.049
 namely the panasonic rear wheel 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:50.090
 engine in two cases i have it 

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:51.950
 may have driven yesterday too 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:03:03.950
 we were luckier here because at ktm 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:03:05.680
 not before that seems to be on the way 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:10.099
 his 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:15.139
 it's a pity well, well, but look good 

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:23.720
 Qatar is here now again since 

00:03:15.139 --> 00:03:26.230
 yes yes that looks good there he is exactly 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:26.230
 is 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:35.210
 you can see it relatively compact just like 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:37.790
 said no direct runner but 

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:39.010
 Gear motor display is the well-known 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:41.720
 panasonic display 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:45.290
 Interestingly, as I said here 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:47.390
 above such a small recuperation circle 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:50.290
 that is when you brake is direct 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:50.290
 decorated 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:04:00.550
 anyway, if I'm not grossly wrong 

00:03:52.520 --> 00:04:00.550
 I also understood a medium engine 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:05.360
 andreas good day 

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:07.520
 now I'm tired I'm doing one right now 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:10.640
 small eurobike tour of my blog 

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:14.180
 and here we have the alternative to 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:17.180
 folk festival model t works but 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:19.370
 better I have already driven more 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:21.829
 power and looks better too 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:24.200
 Maybe here in the back 

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:29.419
 still the model from starter not to 

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:35.000
 confused with start from nice thing 

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:36.470
 accelerated properly responds well ok 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.180
 yes never drives but I have it 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:42.410
 ever tested feels great in the 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:45.290
 cut cut again I am 

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:46.250
 curious if this podcast arrives well 

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:47.480
 But I'm just on the idea 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:48.860
 come that one actually for the times 

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:51.020
 People who do not drive the euro far 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:52.040
 can make for a podcast and 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:54.230
 I've been babbling for a while now 

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:59.030
 almost ten minutes but I'm also one 

00:04:54.230 --> 00:05:00.440
 why I'll be back soon andreas 

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:02.270
 king of extra energy has the long 

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:05.060
 passed the tests and now has one 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:07.130
 own project momentum electric and 

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:07.790
 as I said for a wheel what 1100 euro 

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:11.479
 should cost 

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:15.460
 with force sensor really not bad 

00:05:11.479 --> 00:05:17.510
 very much reduced to the essential and 

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:19.850
 somehow really cool compared to 

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:21.169
 many so much inflated things like 

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:22.340
 then somehow a bad one at the end 

00:05:21.169 --> 00:05:26.030
 But I do not want control either 

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:28.419
 too much advertising do indeed roll before 

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:28.419
 our nose 

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:34.830
 there are probably about that 

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:36.150
 same as with karl cook find 

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:39.540
 I'm quite nice with the colors of the 

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:41.610
 impulse motor is well known 

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:45.210
 nice direct middle engines with 

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:49.160
 great big batteries so good thing 

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:51.630
 any case yes i would say 

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:54.210
 I would be through with my little one 

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:55.230
 euro vector i hope for the people who 

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:58.620
 there were a few 

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:59.970
 to see interesting things and me 

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:03.120
 would say we say goodbye to us 

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:05.220
 A look at the folding bike well-known 

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:08.000
 but you can still see pretty good and 

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:08.000
 bye for now
