 jérémy lead or briand that sticks since September 2000 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:37.650
 little already 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:40.870
 I live in the country I spent all my youth in the countryside 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:45.800
 Always always in the fields to go in the garden and it's true 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.340
 that always help my mother my father 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:50.950
 according to the team and for me 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:53.950
 to make it the first hours 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.540
 it's a job of course but it's mostly a passion 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:00.320
 but what allows me to develop it to the maximum 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.870
 then to be horticultural worker clc first and foremost for him 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.480
 these records any culture whatever it is 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:10.600
 that is, we control the multiplication on sale 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.600
 of course by the transplanting tennis internship 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.070
 while controlling watering fertilization and monitoring 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:21.070
 phytosanitary measures the three essential points that followed a 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.450
 fabrice crcc manufacture his climate his wishes 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:28.480
 it's managing it 

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:30.130
 but it's not just making 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:32.350
 a climate makes different climates 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:34.760
 sc difficult access 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:38.600
 we have to enter different parameters according to the greenhouse blog according to the plans 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.250
 then inside since 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:43.250
 they do not all have the same requirements 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.160
 amine sometimes are very rigorous in her work about fair it takes 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:50.410
 really have a professional conscience 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:53.200
 you have to have a huge sense of analysis 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.510
 always anticipated and the plant always master it 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:59.510
 public finances private 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.110
 to get him out for me he opens the book 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.110
 we will not mock season will be your stomach ache 

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:11.449
 raymond doiron must know why foresee to the advanced 

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:14.449
 the possible evolutions the ttp 

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:20.180
 it is a work that is done in team ultimately 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:23.749
 we are in fashion we are always brought with them several on the same site 

00:02:24.389 --> 00:02:27.909
 for the sake of productivity too but percent 

00:02:27.909 --> 00:02:30.449
 every person still has his 

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:33.449
 his role that everyone brings his little stone to this building 

00:02:34.119 --> 00:02:37.609
 but we work a lot in a team 

00:02:37.609 --> 00:02:41.719
 it's a huge pleasure as long as the plant had finley we produced like 

00:02:41.719 --> 00:02:44.859
 we imagined it at the beginning 

00:02:44.859 --> 00:02:47.229
 in a week the young woman 

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:50.729
 we have to get what we wanted at the beginning it's my art 

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:53.669
 we managed to pass over all the others 

00:02:53.669 --> 00:02:56.589
 I still have a lot to learn 

00:02:56.589 --> 00:02:59.589
 thank you very much for all the time I think they themselves 

00:03:00.499 --> 00:03:03.569
 the beautiful does not mark to last yet things to learn 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:06.809
 towards the gets tailgating not exploit it to the maximum 

00:03:06.809 --> 00:03:10.059
 but if it was to do again I do it again willingly 

00:03:10.059 --> 00:03:13.059
 the same I change
