of<00:01:44.720> things<00:01:45.720> you<00:01:45.840> can<00:01:45.960> play<00:01:46.200> and<00:01:46.470> use<00:01:46.740> UPS<00:01:47.220> or

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
of things you can play and use UPS or

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:48.800 
of things you can play and use UPS or
tells<00:01:47.729> you<00:01:47.880> how<00:01:48.060> long<00:01:48.240> you<00:01:48.360> can<00:01:48.390> be<00:01:48.570> able<00:01:48.720> to

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
tells you how long you can be able to

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.469 
tells you how long you can be able to
use<00:01:48.960> that<00:01:49.170> for<00:01:49.520> the<00:01:50.520> interesting<00:01:51.000> thing<00:01:51.210> is<00:01:51.240> if

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
use that for the interesting thing is if

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.030 
use that for the interesting thing is if
we<00:01:51.570> go<00:01:51.720> ahead<00:01:51.780> and<00:01:51.899> click<00:01:52.079> on<00:01:52.229> super<00:01:52.649> next<00:01:52.920> to

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
we go ahead and click on super next to

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.060 
we go ahead and click on super next to
it<00:01:53.159> so<00:01:53.310> this<00:01:54.030> jumps<00:01:54.600> to<00:01:54.810> from<00:01:55.170> 14<00:01:55.619> hours<00:01:55.829> that

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
it so this jumps to from 14 hours that

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.420 
it so this jumps to from 14 hours that
was<00:01:56.219> latest<00:01:57.000> attempt<00:01:57.540> charge<00:01:57.869> to<00:01:58.560> over<00:01:59.070> 21

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
was latest attempt charge to over 21

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.069 
was latest attempt charge to over 21
hours<00:01:59.759> so<00:01:59.939> obviously<00:02:00.570> that's<00:02:00.689> going<00:02:00.899> to<00:02:00.990> give

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
hours so obviously that's going to give

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.530 
hours so obviously that's going to give
you<00:02:01.229> kind<00:02:01.380> of<00:02:01.530> a<00:02:01.649> a<00:02:01.890> 30<00:02:02.430> odd<00:02:02.640> percent<00:02:03.060> increase

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
you kind of a a 30 odd percent increase

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.600 
you kind of a a 30 odd percent increase
which<00:02:03.689> is<00:02:03.840> really<00:02:04.020> great<00:02:04.200> to<00:02:04.290> see<00:02:04.619> you<00:02:05.280> can<00:02:05.490> see

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
which is really great to see you can see

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.069 
which is really great to see you can see
here<00:02:05.759> you<00:02:05.850> have<00:02:05.880> all<00:02:06.180> your<00:02:06.299> toggle<00:02:06.570> tier<00:02:06.869> which

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
here you have all your toggle tier which

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:10.999 
here you have all your toggle tier which
disabled<00:02:07.860> in<00:02:08.729> this<00:02:09.270> kind<00:02:09.569> of<00:02:09.660> super<00:02:10.110> setting

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
disabled in this kind of super setting

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.320 
disabled in this kind of super setting
so<00:02:11.280> that's<00:02:11.489> going<00:02:11.640> to<00:02:11.700> be<00:02:11.760> great<00:02:11.970> because<00:02:12.150> you

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
so that's going to be great because you

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.600 
so that's going to be great because you
don't<00:02:12.810> have<00:02:12.930> to<00:02:13.050> go<00:02:13.200> in

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
don't have to go in

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:14.860 
don't have to go in
visually<00:02:13.970> in<00:02:14.120> the<00:02:14.210> settings<00:02:14.540> and<00:02:14.660> kind<00:02:14.840> of

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
visually in the settings and kind of

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:16.690 
visually in the settings and kind of
faff<00:02:15.050> about<00:02:15.200> it<00:02:15.500> all<00:02:15.620> and<00:02:15.650> try<00:02:15.860> and<00:02:15.980> find<00:02:16.220> we

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
faff about it all and try and find we

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.250 
faff about it all and try and find we
try<00:02:16.940> to<00:02:17.000> find<00:02:17.210> disable<00:02:17.660> it<00:02:17.750> it<00:02:17.840> just<00:02:17.870> does<00:02:18.140> it

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
try to find disable it it just does it

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.380 
try to find disable it it just does it
all<00:02:18.380> for<00:02:18.590> you<00:02:18.710> and<00:02:18.940> drops<00:02:19.940> the<00:02:20.030> brightness

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
all for you and drops the brightness

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.390 
all for you and drops the brightness
down<00:02:20.540> for<00:02:20.840> you<00:02:20.960> and<00:02:21.230> also<00:02:21.530> disables<00:02:22.190> with<00:02:22.280> your

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
down for you and also disables with your

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:23.980 
down for you and also disables with your
radio<00:02:22.700> tune<00:02:22.970> just<00:02:23.180> leaves<00:02:23.360> your<00:02:23.480> signal<00:02:23.900> so

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:23.990 
radio tune just leaves your signal so

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:25.960 
radio tune just leaves your signal so
you<00:02:24.080> can<00:02:24.230> get<00:02:24.350> texts<00:02:24.710> and<00:02:24.800> things<00:02:24.980> so<00:02:25.520> that

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
you can get texts and things so that

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:27.610 
you can get texts and things so that
gives<00:02:26.150> you<00:02:26.270> 21<00:02:26.630> hours<00:02:26.870> batteries<00:02:27.230> that's<00:02:27.440> not

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
gives you 21 hours batteries that's not

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.310 
gives you 21 hours batteries that's not
too<00:02:27.770> bad<00:02:27.800> and<00:02:28.640> then<00:02:29.180> jumping<00:02:29.390> over<00:02:29.600> on<00:02:29.750> to<00:02:30.110> the

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:30.320 
too bad and then jumping over on to the

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:31.540 
too bad and then jumping over on to the
next<00:02:30.500> one<00:02:30.590> here<00:02:30.800> on<00:02:30.890> the<00:02:30.980> right<00:02:31.130> you<00:02:31.280> just<00:02:31.400> have

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:31.550 
next one here on the right you just have

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:34.420 
next one here on the right you just have
a<00:02:31.580> sleep<00:02:31.850> function<00:02:32.260> so<00:02:33.260> that<00:02:33.560> jumps<00:02:34.070> to<00:02:34.220> a

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
a sleep function so that jumps to a

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:37.240 
a sleep function so that jumps to a
message<00:02:34.910> 23<00:02:35.450> hours<00:02:35.810> almost<00:02:36.650> doubling<00:02:37.130> your

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
message 23 hours almost doubling your

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:39.699 
message 23 hours almost doubling your
battery<00:02:37.610> time<00:02:37.820> there<00:02:38.090> is<00:02:38.870> you<00:02:39.230> can<00:02:39.290> see<00:02:39.500> here

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:39.709 
battery time there is you can see here

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:41.890 
battery time there is you can see here
in<00:02:39.800> the<00:02:39.860> top<00:02:40.070> it<00:02:40.190> enables<00:02:40.610> them<00:02:40.820> airplane<00:02:41.660> mode

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:41.900 
in the top it enables them airplane mode

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:43.900 
in the top it enables them airplane mode
and<00:02:42.200> that's<00:02:42.890> pretty<00:02:43.100> much<00:02:43.220> it<00:02:43.340> disables

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:43.910 
and that's pretty much it disables

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:45.010 
and that's pretty much it disables
pretty<00:02:44.120> much<00:02:44.209> everything<00:02:44.540> on<00:02:44.630> your<00:02:44.750> device

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:45.020 
pretty much everything on your device

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:46.990 
pretty much everything on your device
just<00:02:45.260> in<00:02:45.470> order<00:02:45.709> to<00:02:45.830> give<00:02:46.160> you<00:02:46.250> that<00:02:46.430> higher

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000 
just in order to give you that higher

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.380 
just in order to give you that higher
battery<00:02:47.950> longevity<00:02:48.950> to<00:02:49.670> you<00:02:49.970> know<00:02:50.120> have<00:02:50.360> a

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
battery longevity to you know have a

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:52.000 
battery longevity to you know have a
longer<00:02:50.660> charge<00:02:50.959> for<00:02:51.140> it<00:02:51.170> which<00:02:51.830> is<00:02:51.980> really

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
longer charge for it which is really

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:54.070 
longer charge for it which is really
great<00:02:52.340> so<00:02:52.760> I'm<00:02:52.940> going<00:02:53.150> to<00:02:53.239> jump<00:02:53.450> back<00:02:53.690> on<00:02:53.840> to

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:54.080 
great so I'm going to jump back on to

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:55.750 
great so I'm going to jump back on to
buy<00:02:54.380> normal<00:02:54.709> setting<00:02:54.950> heroes<00:02:55.250> are<00:02:55.400> mostly<00:02:55.670> at

buy normal setting heroes are mostly at
home<00:02:55.910> I<00:02:56.030> don't<00:02:56.209> really<00:02:56.330> need<00:02:56.450> to<00:02:56.600> save<00:02:56.750> battery

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
home I don't really need to save battery

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.170 
home I don't really need to save battery
but<00:02:58.310> it's<00:02:58.459> really<00:02:58.610> good<00:02:58.790> gives<00:02:59.030> you<00:02:59.090> the

great little batteries or statistics
really<00:03:10.790> and<00:03:11.060> I<00:03:11.090> haven't<00:03:11.360> charged<00:03:11.660> my<00:03:11.720> device

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:12.050 
really and I haven't charged my device

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:14.199 
really and I haven't charged my device
since<00:03:12.290> I've<00:03:12.470> had<00:03:12.620> this<00:03:12.770> app<00:03:13.030> opened<00:03:14.030> and

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:14.209 
since I've had this app opened and

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:16.090 
since I've had this app opened and
because<00:03:14.959> that's<00:03:15.080> what<00:03:15.350> it<00:03:15.380> suggests<00:03:15.590> to<00:03:15.860> do

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:16.100 
because that's what it suggests to do

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:18.820 
because that's what it suggests to do
and<00:03:16.420> so<00:03:17.420> if<00:03:17.600> you<00:03:17.959> know<00:03:18.049> over<00:03:18.410> the<00:03:18.500> period<00:03:18.709> of

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:18.830 
and so if you know over the period of

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:21.009 
and so if you know over the period of
having<00:03:19.100> this<00:03:19.190> app<00:03:19.400> for<00:03:19.610> a<00:03:19.640> longer<00:03:19.820> time<00:03:20.019> we

00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:21.019 
having this app for a longer time we

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:23.110 
having this app for a longer time we
have<00:03:21.290> you<00:03:21.470> know<00:03:21.590> a<00:03:21.620> few<00:03:21.860> charges<00:03:22.160> behind<00:03:22.640> on

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120 
have you know a few charges behind on

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:24.789 
have you know a few charges behind on
your<00:03:23.480> belt<00:03:23.720> and<00:03:23.840> that<00:03:24.049> you<00:03:24.230> can<00:03:24.260> kind<00:03:24.650> of<00:03:24.680> have

00:03:24.789 --> 00:03:24.799 
your belt and that you can kind of have

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:26.380 
your belt and that you can kind of have
a<00:03:24.860> bit<00:03:25.070> more<00:03:25.280> sort<00:03:25.519> of<00:03:25.549> in-depth<00:03:25.850> statistics

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:26.390 
a bit more sort of in-depth statistics

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:28.270 
a bit more sort of in-depth statistics
about<00:03:26.510> that<00:03:26.810> so<00:03:27.110> I'd<00:03:27.440> recommend<00:03:27.590> you<00:03:27.920> do<00:03:28.070> that

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:28.280 
about that so I'd recommend you do that

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.670 
about that so I'd recommend you do that
and<00:03:28.519> and<00:03:29.420> then<00:03:29.570> you<00:03:29.750> have<00:03:29.900> kinds<00:03:30.200> of<00:03:30.260> calendar

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:30.680 
and and then you have kinds of calendar

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:32.229 
and and then you have kinds of calendar
for<00:03:30.890> the<00:03:31.040> third<00:03:31.250> time<00:03:31.280> among<00:03:31.730> here<00:03:31.970> and<00:03:32.120> that

00:03:32.229 --> 00:03:32.239 
for the third time among here and that

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:33.759 
for the third time among here and that
gives<00:03:32.420> you<00:03:32.600> kind<00:03:32.780> of<00:03:32.900> lose<00:03:33.019> statistics<00:03:33.680> you

00:03:33.759 --> 00:03:33.769 
gives you kind of lose statistics you

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:35.650 
gives you kind of lose statistics you
can<00:03:33.890> see<00:03:34.100> here<00:03:34.280> like<00:03:34.790> I<00:03:34.820> haven't<00:03:35.120> charged<00:03:35.510> this

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:18.770 
really really good and don't worry about

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:20.200 
really really good and don't worry about
all<00:06:19.100> the<00:06:19.220> chinese<00:06:19.700> and<00:06:19.910> that<00:06:20.000> when<00:06:20.150> you

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:20.210 
all the chinese and that when you

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:21.280 
all the chinese and that when you
download<00:06:20.570> it<00:06:20.720> because<00:06:20.810> when<00:06:21.050> you<00:06:21.140> actually

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:21.290 
download it because when you actually

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:22.540 
download it because when you actually
have<00:06:21.590> it<00:06:21.710> installed<00:06:21.980> it's<00:06:22.220> all<00:06:22.340> in<00:06:22.460> English

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:22.550 
have it installed it's all in English

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:27.020 
okay guys I sort of just popped my

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:28.810 
okay guys I sort of just popped my
device<00:06:27.380> in<00:06:27.620> and<00:06:27.800> found<00:06:28.100> some<00:06:28.340> amazing<00:06:28.430> new

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:28.820 
device in and found some amazing new

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:29.830 
device in and found some amazing new
features<00:06:29.000> that<00:06:29.210> I<00:06:29.360> didn't<00:06:29.540> really<00:06:29.630> want<00:06:29.810> to

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:29.840 
features that I didn't really want to

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:32.530 
features that I didn't really want to
leave<00:06:29.900> out<00:06:30.200> of<00:06:30.350> this<00:06:30.500> video<00:06:30.919> so<00:06:31.640> once<00:06:32.300> you<00:06:32.390> plug

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:32.540 
leave out of this video so once you plug

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:33.730 
leave out of this video so once you plug
it<00:06:32.690> is<00:06:32.750> wighting<00:06:32.930> you<00:06:33.200> can<00:06:33.320> see<00:06:33.470> here<00:06:33.650> you<00:06:33.710> have

00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:33.740 
it is wighting you can see here you have

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:36.130 
it is wighting you can see here you have
three<00:06:34.100> different<00:06:34.310> charging<00:06:34.820> types<00:06:35.060> so<00:06:35.900> if<00:06:36.050> you

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:36.140 
three different charging types so if you

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:37.420 
three different charging types so if you
have<00:06:36.260> a<00:06:36.289> like<00:06:36.470> a<00:06:36.500> low<00:06:36.710> battery<00:06:36.919> you<00:06:37.190> can<00:06:37.220> go

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:37.430 
have a like a low battery you can go

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:39.159 
have a like a low battery you can go
ahead<00:06:37.520> and<00:06:37.669> press<00:06:37.910> fast<00:06:38.210> charging<00:06:38.660> and<00:06:38.960> that

00:06:39.159 --> 00:06:39.169 
ahead and press fast charging and that

00:06:39.169 --> 00:06:40.570 
ahead and press fast charging and that
will<00:06:39.289> charge<00:06:39.530> you<00:06:39.740> right<00:06:39.950> at<00:06:40.160> eight

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:40.580 
will charge you right at eight

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:43.600 
will charge you right at eight
as<00:06:41.509> quickly<00:06:41.750> as<00:06:41.930> possible<00:06:42.610> continuation

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:43.610 
as quickly as possible continuation

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:46.450 
as quickly as possible continuation
charging<00:06:44.539> once<00:06:44.750> you<00:06:44.930> have<00:06:45.080> kind<00:06:45.409> of<00:06:45.530> where<00:06:46.430> I

00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:46.460 
charging once you have kind of where I

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:48.580 
charging once you have kind of where I
am<00:06:46.550> now<00:06:46.729> among<00:06:46.909> eighty-six<00:06:47.509> percent<00:06:47.569> it<00:06:48.470> will

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:48.590 
am now among eighty-six percent it will

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:50.260 
am now among eighty-six percent it will
charge<00:06:48.800> with<00:06:49.069> like<00:06:49.250> a<00:06:49.280> diminished<00:06:49.849> current

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:50.270 
charge with like a diminished current

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:51.969 
charge with like a diminished current
which<00:06:50.449> means<00:06:50.750> that<00:06:50.960> you'll<00:06:51.139> end<00:06:51.409> up<00:06:51.530> being

00:06:51.969 --> 00:06:51.979 
which means that you'll end up being

00:06:51.979 --> 00:06:53.649 
which means that you'll end up being
able<00:06:52.159> to<00:06:52.219> charge<00:06:52.490> to<00:06:52.699> like<00:06:52.849> one<00:06:53.360> hundred

00:06:53.649 --> 00:06:53.659 
able to charge to like one hundred

00:06:53.659 --> 00:06:56.260 
able to charge to like one hundred
percent<00:06:53.689> of<00:06:54.199> all<00:06:54.620> fine<00:06:55.069> and<00:06:55.099> you<00:06:55.550> know<00:06:55.729> it<00:06:56.000> will

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:56.270 
percent of all fine and you know it will

00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:57.369 
percent of all fine and you know it will
actually<00:06:56.509> be<00:06:56.719> one<00:06:56.810> hundred<00:06:56.870> percent<00:06:57.050> battery

00:06:57.369 --> 00:06:57.379 
actually be one hundred percent battery

00:06:57.379 --> 00:06:59.499 
actually be one hundred percent battery
and<00:06:57.830> then<00:06:58.400> you<00:06:58.490> have<00:06:58.610> trickle<00:06:58.969> charging<00:06:59.300> as

00:06:59.499 --> 00:06:59.509 
and then you have trickle charging as

00:06:59.509 --> 00:07:02.550 
and then you have trickle charging as
well<00:06:59.719> which<00:07:00.560> reduces<00:07:00.919> the<00:07:01.189> current<00:07:01.520> charging

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:02.560 
well which reduces the current charging

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:04.540 
well which reduces the current charging
when<00:07:03.560> battery<00:07:03.770> is<00:07:03.979> full<00:07:04.159> to<00:07:04.280> keep<00:07:04.460> the

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:04.550 
when battery is full to keep the

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:05.890 
when battery is full to keep the
electrons<00:07:04.939> moving<00:07:05.210> and<00:07:05.509> linked<00:07:05.689> from<00:07:05.750> the

00:07:05.890 --> 00:07:05.900 
electrons moving and linked from the

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:08.439 
electrons moving and linked from the
battery<00:07:06.199> life<00:07:06.349> so<00:07:07.159> you<00:07:07.969> know<00:07:08.090> once<00:07:08.300> you're

00:07:08.439 --> 00:07:08.449 
battery life so you know once you're

00:07:08.449 --> 00:07:09.939 
battery life so you know once you're
gonna<00:07:08.599> soar<00:07:08.930> going<00:07:09.110> to<00:07:09.169> bed<00:07:09.289> maybe<00:07:09.500> you<00:07:09.770> wanna

gonna soar going to bed maybe you wanna

00:07:09.949 --> 00:07:11.830 
gonna soar going to bed maybe you wanna
