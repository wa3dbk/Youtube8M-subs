00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:08.860
 the slogan of this campaign is the people 

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:10.120
 good is not tattooed where is what 

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:12.040
 are finding out is what is 

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:13.830
 varying because as far as I got 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:15.790
 yesterday in the networks lady 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.179
 they blamed the government for a 

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:20.669
 I do not remember what state why not 

00:00:18.179 --> 00:00:23.829
 I was saying they can be 

00:00:20.669 --> 00:00:26.679
 Aguascalientes, now we have to 

00:00:23.829 --> 00:00:29.019
 corroborate this stand that are 

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:31.269
 corroborating that it truly is a 

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:34.120
 campaign that has the government logo 

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:37.270
 of Aguascalientes that is not a non- 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:38.170
 be one of those this the muletazo be 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:40.300
 false 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:43.360
 not that I 'll continue with him later 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:45.340
 the rag and this and right now but look 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:47.170
 nothing else is very dangerous I am with your 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:49.330
 position I know people very but very very 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:50.740
 good that has tattoos and that does not have 

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:53.450
 nothing to do with attitude or much 

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:57.160
 less in life look 

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:57.160
 it's the secretary 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.860
 of public security in aguascalientes 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.130
 single command strategy 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.470
 to monitor access to the city 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:20.580
 and they are arresting whoever is considered 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.580
 suspect 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.580
 among them the tattooed people 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:33.619
 and then already if you wear a tattoo you are 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:36.409
 suspect and then your name goes up 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:39.170
 to the mexico platform to see if 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:41.780
 you have some this if you owe something or in case 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:43.970
 you should or in case it occurs to you because if 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:45.979
 you wear a tattoo then tomorrow 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:47.990
 who knows you can think of peace is 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:50.630
 very serious means that what decision more 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:55.670
 out of the root the municipal government 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:58.100
 It's hot from aguascalientes good for 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:00.200
 for more moms parts this from 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.640
 then go make a note of that 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.700
 our head of information is already 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:07.360
 but doomed and that we could trace 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:10.910
 effect is a government campaign 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:14.410
 municipal de Aguascalientes is titled 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:14.410
 good people do not get tattooed 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:19.590
 stop vehicles that do not have plates 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:23.599
 of the state 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.599
 that have tinted windows 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:29.349
 and anyone who is made 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:31.870
 strange that you and I brothers no longer 

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:35.260
 let's have that vale de aguascalientes 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:37.659
 you have a tattoo, you do not retain a 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:42.599
 work of art we are going to give to 

00:02:37.659 --> 00:02:42.599
 our friends from aguascalientes a 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:55.470
 It is this work of art is to see the photo 

00:02:53.939 --> 00:02:57.930
 opaque 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:05.070
 the bass saying nothing else there are that good 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:07.500
 are the two who say the most 

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:10.590
 let's make a wave so that 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:14.150
 you want and a cool green record now 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:14.150
 if it is not like that 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:18.550
 that's 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:23.730
 for radio people we are 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:26.430
 taking a picture to have us 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:28.260
 well signed in aguascalientes that already 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:31.340
 know who we are 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:36.360
 that's loaded this what's your name if 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:39.920
 the microphone is my same i am thick 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:39.920
 see you at the Aguascalientes fair 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:45.819
 you are a rapper, no, you have never had 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:48.670
 no problem after seen like this 

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:51.700
 is someone violated never in my life this 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:57.329
 You have not stolen anything you skipped 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:57.329
 someone in a woman who worked 

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:05.080
 then it would not have to be 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:06.610
 suspect I'm not leaving I'm a clown and 

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:08.560
 I work here every day they know where 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:10.300
 to be clear that yes I do not know if 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:12.840
 someone looking for me knows where to find 

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:12.840
 less 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:15.910
 safe 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:25.940
 see the image that is 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:28.610
 circulating in the networks about this 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:31.340
 which it is truly a stupidity 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:34.040
 good people do not get tattoos for the people of 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:37.250
 radio we are seeing the poster is the 

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:38.660
 creation itself and with the logo of the 

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:40.250
 municipal government of aguascalientes 

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:44.390
 besides nothing else 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:46.280
 see how dangerous this is and good 

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:48.800
 in times of course they are not 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:52.030
 easy but not for the psoe not for 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:56.690
 start stigmatizing and I acquired mine 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:05:00.230
 lizardo and from from the the from 

00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:01.850
 the criterion more scratch or small than 

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:04.610
 one can imagine when going back the year 

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:06.620
 of which party the party came from 

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:08.240
 municipal water president until the 

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:11.690
 shore we ask why they are interested 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:14.960
 please of political origin from the 

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:19.669
 municipal government of aguascalientes 

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:22.430
 what match is the colors of that 

00:05:19.669 --> 00:05:24.050
 promotion are blue and Hispanic but 

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:25.759
 let's see let's see why the governor 

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:28.400
 is the example istac a rudo sano no 

00:05:25.759 --> 00:05:29.870
 Lusty dweller is the governor and 

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:33.020
 hot first 

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:35.539
 but lateral angel diaz is what I had 

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:38.599
 the mayoralty now high let's find out 

00:05:35.539 --> 00:05:41.330
 but look, I was hoping that 

00:05:38.599 --> 00:05:44.360
 was a false transfer that was not 

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:47.780
 to jonathan some waves and a half goes to 

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:49.970
 policy of then to throw him out 

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:52.970
 How much is this so many women 

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:55.940
 pan something always remains but no no 

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:58.550
 it does not seem like it's a campaign 

00:05:55.940 --> 00:06:04.250
 from the municipal government of aguascalientes 

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:06.740
 that very absurd and very painful and double 

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:09.349
 moral no less because on the one hand it 

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:12.440
 can relate to a person with 

00:06:09.349 --> 00:06:14.120
 tattoo with being criminal in order and when 

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:16.370
 we see things that happen in 

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:18.660
 aguascalientes especially when the 

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:21.740
 fair of aguascalientes in short is 

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:25.230
 mayor juan antonio martÃ­n del campo 

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:27.660
 of the swamp it is clear that 

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:29.370
 new national account or action and one of 

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:31.320
 the politicians that will emerge and be 

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:34.680
 related to an issue that is really 

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:38.780
 embarrassing nothing more like nothing more 

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:38.780
 as a man exercise to the best 

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:46.580
 a doctor who saved someone's life 

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:48.650
 from his family maybe a someone who 

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:52.520
 a paramedic is in the ambulances 

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:56.470
 that took him out of the heart attack to the best 

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:56.470
 under the robe has a tattoo 

00:06:58.290 --> 00:07:03.670
 impressive impresses it was already 

00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:06.850
 president of the bread in aguascalientes 

00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:10.390
 this man king of the field was 

00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:14.080
 coordinator of the felipe campaign in 

00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:16.390
 the region and has been a local deputy two 

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:20.830
 sometimes what atrocity 

00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:22.900
 good with that trajectory something something something 

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:25.300
 well I would have to show but it seems 

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:27.490
 that is are insisting on showing 

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:31.350
 the panistas unfortunately for their 

00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:31.350
 party the worst of the repertoire
