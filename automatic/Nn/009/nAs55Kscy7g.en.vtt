in<00:01:22.970> this<00:01:23.150> video<00:01:23.510> we're<00:01:24.290> using<00:01:24.410> the<00:01:24.620> axe-fx<00:01:24.950> to

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:25.430 
in this video we're using the axe-fx to

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:30.070 
in this video we're using the axe-fx to
in<00:01:26.420> conjunction<00:01:26.900> with<00:01:27.080> a<00:01:27.260> matrix<00:01:27.560> GT<00:01:28.520> 1500<00:01:29.480> FX

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:30.080 
in conjunction with a matrix GT 1500 FX

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.310 
in conjunction with a matrix GT 1500 FX
BD<00:01:30.740> power<00:01:31.040> amplifier<00:01:31.610> which<00:01:31.880> is<00:01:31.910> a<00:01:32.210> 3<00:01:33.020> channel

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:33.320 
BD power amplifier which is a 3 channel

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:37.540 
BD power amplifier which is a 3 channel
solid-state<00:01:34.250> power<00:01:34.520> amp<00:01:35.410> to<00:01:36.410> do<00:01:36.590> the<00:01:36.860> wet<00:01:37.250> dry

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:37.550 
solid-state power amp to do the wet dry

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:40.930 
solid-state power amp to do the wet dry
wet<00:01:37.580> application<00:01:38.290> so<00:01:39.290> we're<00:01:39.890> using<00:01:40.070> output<00:01:40.640> 1

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:40.940 
wet application so we're using output 1

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:43.000 
wet application so we're using output 1
out<00:01:41.720> of<00:01:42.050> the<00:01:42.229> axe-fx

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:43.010 
out of the axe-fx

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:46.359 
out of the axe-fx
into<00:01:43.340> the<00:01:43.460> B<00:01:43.850> amp<00:01:44.570> which<00:01:45.560> is<00:01:45.710> our<00:01:45.890> center

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:46.369
