and then play Knight to e5 it probably

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.260 
and then play Knight to e5 it probably

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.979 
the exchange but he decided to trade and
I<00:00:59.070> guess<00:00:59.460> get<00:00:59.609> the<00:00:59.730> d5<00:01:00.090> square<00:01:00.270> for<00:01:00.570> his<00:01:00.690> Knight

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
I guess get the d5 square for his Knight

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.260 
I guess get the d5 square for his Knight
you<00:01:01.260> know<00:01:01.379> so<00:01:01.530> the<00:01:02.039> white<00:01:02.520> pawn<00:01:02.760> is<00:01:02.910> no<00:01:03.030> longer

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
you know so the white pawn is no longer

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:04.789 
you know so the white pawn is no longer
here<00:01:03.510> so<00:01:03.690> this<00:01:03.809> time<00:01:04.019> able<00:01:04.320> to<00:01:04.379> go<00:01:04.470> here<00:01:04.650> in<00:01:04.710> the
