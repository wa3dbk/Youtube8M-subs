00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
mocked that hand or fold that hand so

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.700 
mocked that hand or fold that hand so
they<00:01:48.210> think<00:01:48.270> that<00:01:48.689> other<00:01:48.840> players<00:01:49.170> know<00:01:49.470> that

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
or they would they say things like I

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.289 
or they would they say things like I
would<00:01:52.380> never<00:01:52.530> call<00:01:52.829> that<00:01:53.130> River<00:01:53.399> and<00:01:53.670> all<00:01:54.119> of<00:01:54.240> a

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
dangerous and that's why some of the

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:37.260 
dangerous and that's why some of the

ways actually beat this game like I sit
down<00:02:37.390> these<00:02:37.600> people<00:02:37.900> and<00:02:38.290> like<00:02:38.560> what<00:02:38.680> should<00:02:38.800> I

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
down these people and like what should I

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:40.290 
down these people and like what should I
do<00:02:38.920> but<00:02:39.310> I<00:02:39.460> was<00:02:39.550> like<00:02:39.640> you<00:02:39.760> should<00:02:39.850> play

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
over again and they would they basically

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.140 
over again and they would they basically
do<00:03:05.050> is<00:03:05.260> they<00:03:05.800> try<00:03:05.860> to<00:03:06.100> justify<00:03:06.820> because
