00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:08.410
 Then this flow of time when we make an order like this actually in the place of the guitar Mr. Nishi 

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:12.320
 I want you to teach me roughly 

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:16.219
 Yes I hear Misono tail with its customers 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:18.470
 If the discussion lives and the specification is finalized 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:21.800
 It is at the stop of maa 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:29.440
 I have a lot of choices from the materials though 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:44.590
 Well this it's quite Typical Buraji bastard all the time but Well Torre ago 

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:49.280
 Booboo Matcha Tiramisu in the condition I bought 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:57.890
 Timer becomes a state as close to symmetrically nearly symmetrical 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:01:01.950
 In the Kitaueno width portion width of the good and the take off to back 5:00 later Well acoustic characteristic guard left parenthesis 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:06.470
 In Attari Toka pattern is closer 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:10.130
 I 'm thinking it's good to be exclusive 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:15.730
 It is a typical way 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:17.320
 And even by air match as Well top it is the same I'd guitar bag in place 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:19.320
 make 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:22.380
 Four days 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:27.030
 Well as the procedure is that simultaneous 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:29.360
 I will proceed in various ways, but in the case of the body first of the fluffy thing 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:32.720
 At the center 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:37.630
 Appointed to the beginning from the adhesive to 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:40.689
 The Oyama used by flowers to adjust its thickness is basically that 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:44.140
 The first boom of Fujima is fine 

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:49.220
 The final but I use the machine Toka or a canna 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:50.770
 Although in respect gathered'm an effective metal plate I scraper 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:55.840
 Using this 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:56.859
 We will add thickness finally, not such as paper sandpaper, but it is such an amazing fact 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:02.170
 Use a place 

00:01:56.859 --> 00:02:02.860
 This it Is Well In short I'm a type of metal that is said to be a building spring steel 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:06.219
 But 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:07.210
 To cotton linen and willingly 

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:11.850
 school 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:13.970
 Here I'm putting the company said it 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:17.060
 Why by using positive 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:18.530
 Well, it's a little different from paper 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.450
 Take off 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:26.450
 It feels like 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:32.750
 As it is possible to use it in the image, it can be very useful because 8 subtle adjustments can be made. 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:38.020
 Well then, when I was able to do it now, it seems that I 'm going to raise such saturation 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:40.850
 The side is also basically a kind of like a match as it is called a match match 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:41.810
 I'm getting a lot of sins I got this too 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:45.540
 a 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:50.400
 Moisture and heat mud from established a thickness 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:51.780
 I 'm listening to it so Seibu will usually include that water, but this is also about heat 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:55.050
 Ieupyon 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:57.350
 It is said that it is said that heat penguin general theory 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:03:01.520
 Gets hot 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:03.460
 Anne's clothes atmel Pylondish is quite as a structure 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:07.450
 This item 2 

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:12.250
 I will bend in and out while pressing 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:14.770
 I bend in it, but because there are various body ncp , its own inner shape 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:16.500
 Because we are doing, we go beyond the ball time 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:17.890
 Adjust to bending 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:22.930
 How to say 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:25.100
 I'm going to set in, I can't do this right away 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:29.990
 It depends on when you solve 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:32.510
 Bend a little, lay a little, bend a little, lay a little 

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:38.870
 Wood and Kodama Room 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:39.650
 I will mix gently little by little, and if it is rough with this, the shape of the guitar is not so good 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:41.590
 I think 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:44.950
 Even higher 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:48.849
 Well Well I guess I'm the so-called lining 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:54.970
 Adhesive Pu Jun also but I think with the incoming Well 

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:57.350
 Well this lining ultra-Belmoja if this side is re-fitted to the mold just before 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:04:00.620
 I'm paying but I say it is 

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:06.670
 It's all about making these things so-called 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:10.050
 Well when I paste the top and back to the side well again itself is already true 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:14.250
 I think that the thickness is so because it is only about 3 mm 

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:19.709
 And stick the top and bag do not stick mark 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:22.170
 There is this in the sense that it is going to be a law, and it's Eggart's idiot 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:26.270
 In combination with tax 

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:31.220
 That was in what the wind is Naa fan Is there at that time 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:32.690
 I 'll fix it, but that line looks like it's too hard to fit into the mold but it 's a clothespin 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:34.330
 Like high 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:36.409
 In the clamp 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:43.069
 I will wear 

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:44.989
 How much is it glued Well that glue itself is basically well in about 30 minutes 

00:04:43.069 --> 00:04:50.209
 Although it cures 

00:04:44.989 --> 00:04:52.490
 Well, at the same time, I will go with the neck at the same time, so basically the first one for bonding 

00:04:50.209 --> 00:04:54.660
 Place you it in 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:56.180
 To because after its 

00:04:54.660 --> 00:05:00.740
 So-called 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:01.400
 Top and pack had done before to do this do it's right that the Soviet Union would bracing 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:05.500
 Follow 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:06.490
 It is a state of book match, but from that state 

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:14.050
 Ets 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:18.409
 Rude Religious Affairs Agency on the inside of the box as the guitar you will have stretched the materials the reinforcement of power 

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:20.520
 Well Well that say so-called bracing 

00:05:18.409 --> 00:05:25.349
 Play new exclusive 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:26.039
 I have heard that there are some special and professional professionals in any case. 

00:05:25.349 --> 00:05:31.349
 I But 

00:05:26.039 --> 00:05:32.889
 Ah so something but this is Toka angle of like a lesbian play Mr. Good case of Nissan 

00:05:31.349 --> 00:05:38.949
 Anyway 

00:05:32.889 --> 00:05:41.160
 Well I'm a little but my master is my prime minister is 8 Arvin that skill and 

00:05:38.949 --> 00:05:48.030
 I say so pretty famous 

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:51.340
 Basically Kedomo I'm a person of the famous to Policy Division in the road that my prime minister the tree's 

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:53.120
 Learn from and go on your own 

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:58.340
 I guess I made it 

00:05:53.120 --> 00:06:02.200
 I learned it because I have a bracing style, so I made it my own 

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:04.920
 Interpret on your own 

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:04.920
 I do
