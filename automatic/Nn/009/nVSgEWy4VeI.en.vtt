Amanda<00:00:26.870> about<00:00:27.140> the<00:00:27.860> fabric<00:00:28.280> forming<00:00:28.670> and<00:00:29.119> and

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:29.570 
Amanda about the fabric forming and and

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:32.080 
Amanda about the fabric forming and and
how<00:00:29.780> it's<00:00:30.740> such<00:00:31.010> an<00:00:31.130> exciting<00:00:31.430> way<00:00:31.730> to<00:00:31.760> work

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:32.090 
how it's such an exciting way to work

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:33.760 
how it's such an exciting way to work
with<00:00:32.239> concrete<00:00:32.599> because<00:00:32.840> most<00:00:33.379> people<00:00:33.650> don't

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:33.770 
with concrete because most people don't

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:35.560 
with concrete because most people don't
think<00:00:33.890> of<00:00:34.129> it<00:00:34.280> yeah<00:00:34.520> how<00:00:35.300> would<00:00:35.449> you<00:00:35.540> use

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:35.570 
think of it yeah how would you use

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:37.869 
think of it yeah how would you use
fabric<00:00:36.199> and<00:00:36.410> concrete<00:00:36.800> right<00:00:36.920> but<00:00:37.340> here<00:00:37.610> I

00:00:37.869 --> 00:00:37.879 
fabric and concrete right but here I

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:39.939 
fabric and concrete right but here I
just<00:00:38.030> have<00:00:38.239> this<00:00:38.540> material<00:00:39.199> which<00:00:39.440> is<00:00:39.650> um

00:00:39.939 --> 00:00:39.949 
just have this material which is um

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:41.740 
just have this material which is um
sheet<00:00:40.580> material<00:00:41.120> we've<00:00:41.239> got<00:00:41.390> this<00:00:41.540> from<00:00:41.690> the

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:41.750 
sheet material we've got this from the

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:46.240 
sheet material we've got this from the
discount<00:00:42.170> fabric<00:00:42.620> place<00:00:42.860> it's<00:00:44.710> yeah<00:00:45.710> yeah

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:46.250 
discount fabric place it's yeah yeah

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:51.970 
discount fabric place it's yeah yeah
yeah<00:00:46.520> and<00:00:46.850> so<00:00:47.300> also<00:00:47.570> I<00:00:50.290> cut<00:00:51.290> this<00:00:51.410> out<00:00:51.590> we<00:00:51.800> put

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:51.980 
yeah and so also I cut this out we put

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:54.250 
yeah and so also I cut this out we put
these<00:00:52.160> tabs<00:00:52.550> here<00:00:52.880> and<00:00:53.630> the<00:00:53.720> tabs<00:00:53.960> are<00:00:54.230> for

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:54.260 
these tabs here and the tabs are for

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.389 
these tabs here and the tabs are for
convenience<00:00:55.219> of<00:00:55.399> pulling<00:00:56.210> it<00:00:56.480> out<00:00:56.630> and<00:00:57.399> now

00:00:58.389 --> 00:00:58.399 
convenience of pulling it out and now

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:00.430 
convenience of pulling it out and now
the<00:00:58.460> material<00:00:58.790> is<00:00:59.180> flat<00:00:59.450> we<00:01:00.020> would<00:01:00.140> just<00:01:00.290> mix

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:00.440 
the material is flat we would just mix

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.619 
the material is flat we would just mix
up<00:01:00.590> the<00:01:00.739> shape<00:01:00.920> cream<00:01:01.219> and<00:01:02.000> we<00:01:02.270> would<00:01:02.420> show<00:01:02.570> you

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:02.629 
up the shape cream and we would show you

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:04.389 
up the shape cream and we would show you
in<00:01:02.840> another<00:01:03.110> video<00:01:03.320> how<00:01:03.770> to<00:01:03.800> make<00:01:03.920> something

00:01:04.389 --> 00:01:04.399 
in another video how to make something

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:07.240 
in another video how to make something
shaped<00:01:04.610> so<00:01:05.180> there's<00:01:05.360> two<00:01:05.540> consistencies<00:01:06.320> one

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:07.250 
shaped so there's two consistencies one

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:10.359 
shaped so there's two consistencies one
is<00:01:07.550> a<00:01:07.899> clay<00:01:08.899> like<00:01:09.140> consistency<00:01:09.530> where<00:01:10.190> you

00:01:10.359 --> 00:01:10.369 
is a clay like consistency where you

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:13.180 
is a clay like consistency where you
could<00:01:10.520> actually<00:01:10.700> roll<00:01:11.119> it<00:01:11.149> out<00:01:11.479> and<00:01:12.190> treat

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:13.190 
could actually roll it out and treat

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:15.399 
could actually roll it out and treat
almost<00:01:13.460> like<00:01:13.760> clay<00:01:13.970> and<00:01:14.750> the<00:01:14.840> other<00:01:15.080> would<00:01:15.380> be

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:15.409 
almost like clay and the other would be

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:18.550 
almost like clay and the other would be
a<00:01:15.860> pourable<00:01:16.520> consistency<00:01:16.930> that<00:01:17.930> let's<00:01:18.350> say<00:01:18.470> if

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560 
a pourable consistency that let's say if

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.710 
a pourable consistency that let's say if
this<00:01:18.680> was<00:01:18.890> really<00:01:19.400> flat<00:01:19.670> and<00:01:20.000> you<00:01:20.119> poured<00:01:20.570> it

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:20.720 
this was really flat and you poured it

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:22.990 
this was really flat and you poured it
on<00:01:20.900> here<00:01:21.229> it<00:01:21.409> would<00:01:21.560> articulate<00:01:22.190> every<00:01:22.729> little

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:23.000 
on here it would articulate every little

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:34.510 
on here it would articulate every little
detail<00:01:23.180> but<00:01:23.930> it'd<00:01:24.020> be<00:01:24.110> too<00:01:24.320> fluid<00:01:24.650> to<00:01:24.890> pick<00:01:25.070> up

you<00:01:55.650> can<00:01:55.800> always<00:01:56.070> add<00:01:56.400> a<00:01:56.430> little<00:01:56.670> bit<00:01:57.180> more

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
you can always add a little bit more

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:16.310 
you can always add a little bit more
water<00:01:57.630> what<00:01:58.470> we<00:01:58.590> call<00:01:58.800> be<00:01:58.980> tempered<00:02:14.630> as<00:02:15.630> we<00:02:16.110> do

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320 
water what we call be tempered as we do

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:20.780 
water what we call be tempered as we do
this<00:02:16.560> and<00:02:16.860> we<00:02:17.100> get<00:02:17.910> these<00:02:18.150> cracks<00:02:19.110> the<00:02:20.100> heel<00:02:20.400> so

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
this and we get these cracks the heel so

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:25.220 
this and we get these cracks the heel so
to<00:02:20.850> speak<00:02:22.910> then<00:02:23.910> you<00:02:24.240> would<00:02:24.390> let<00:02:24.540> it<00:02:24.660> set<00:02:24.930> up<00:02:25.080> a

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
to speak then you would let it set up a

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.470 
to speak then you would let it set up a
little<00:02:25.440> bit<00:02:25.650> just<00:02:26.430> a<00:02:26.580> little<00:02:26.610> bit<00:02:26.880> wait<00:02:27.450> a

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
little bit just a little bit wait a

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.210 
little bit just a little bit wait a
little<00:02:27.690> bit<00:02:27.930> and<00:02:28.110> then<00:02:28.410> as<00:02:28.590> it<00:02:28.740> stiffens<00:02:29.100> up

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
little bit and then as it stiffens up

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.280 
little bit and then as it stiffens up
and<00:02:29.370> then<00:02:29.459> we<00:02:29.580> could<00:02:29.760> go<00:02:29.910> back<00:02:30.090> again<00:02:30.480> once

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
and then we could go back again once

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.010 
and then we could go back again once
we've<00:02:31.560> determined<00:02:32.340> that<00:02:32.730> this<00:02:33.300> is<00:02:33.480> it<00:02:33.690> we're

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.020 
we've determined that this is it we're

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:37.550 
we've determined that this is it we're
got<00:02:34.830> it<00:02:35.010> all<00:02:35.130> finished<00:02:35.520> out<00:02:35.700> nicely<00:02:35.970> then<00:02:36.660> with

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
got it all finished out nicely then with

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.090 
got it all finished out nicely then with
any<00:02:37.800> cement<00:02:38.520> product<00:02:39.330> the<00:02:40.140> concrete<00:02:40.650> product

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 
any cement product the concrete product

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:44.210 
any cement product the concrete product
we<00:02:41.250> want<00:02:41.490> to<00:02:41.640> cure<00:02:42.360> it<00:02:42.480> slowly<00:02:42.840> okay<00:02:43.830> it's

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
we want to cure it slowly okay it's

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.000 
we want to cure it slowly okay it's
called<00:02:44.489> hydrating<00:02:45.150> and<00:02:45.530> there's<00:02:46.530> chemical

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
called hydrating and there's chemical

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.070 
called hydrating and there's chemical
reactions<00:02:47.459> going<00:02:47.640> on<00:02:47.910> and<00:02:48.269> it<00:02:48.330> needs<00:02:48.540> water<00:02:48.780> to

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
reactions going on and it needs water to

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.530 
reactions going on and it needs water to
do<00:02:49.230> that<00:02:49.440> okay<00:02:50.310> so<00:02:50.760> depending<00:02:51.180> on<00:02:51.269> the<00:02:51.360> weather

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
do that okay so depending on the weather

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.750 
do that okay so depending on the weather
let's<00:02:51.780> say<00:02:51.870> it's<00:02:52.110> really<00:02:52.500> dry<00:02:52.800> or<00:02:52.830> hot<00:02:53.400> then

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
let's say it's really dry or hot then

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.270 
let's say it's really dry or hot then
you<00:02:53.940> want<00:02:54.209> to<00:02:54.300> make<00:02:54.660> sure<00:02:54.690> it<00:02:55.110> sits<00:02:55.320> moist<00:02:55.739> so

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
you want to make sure it sits moist so

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.150 
you want to make sure it sits moist so
what<00:02:56.430> we<00:02:56.550> do<00:02:56.700> is<00:02:56.850> just<00:02:57.060> cover<00:02:57.840> it<00:02:57.989> with<00:02:58.200> some

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
what we do is just cover it with some

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.820 
what we do is just cover it with some
demographic<00:03:00.060> with<00:03:00.269> painters<00:03:00.630> plastic<00:03:00.900> and

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
demographic with painters plastic and

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:03.900
