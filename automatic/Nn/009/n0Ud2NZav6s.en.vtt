00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
that's just in Canada here because we

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.220 
that's just in Canada here because we
use<00:00:11.790> the<00:00:13.790> 4/4<00:00:14.790> band<00:00:15.089> for<00:00:15.330> LTE<00:00:15.660> I'm<00:00:15.839> not<00:00:15.990> exactly

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
use the 4/4 band for LTE I'm not exactly

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.870 
use the 4/4 band for LTE I'm not exactly
sure<00:00:16.940> but<00:00:18.740> if<00:00:19.740> you<00:00:19.859> take<00:00:20.070> a<00:00:20.100> look<00:00:20.369> here<00:00:20.670> you'll

00:00:25.089 --> 00:00:25.099 
see right now I'm on 3G I got two bars

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:27.290 
see right now I'm on 3G I got two bars
that's<00:00:26.099> what<00:00:26.340> I'm<00:00:26.430> gonna<00:00:26.519> do<00:00:26.789> is<00:00:26.970> a<00:00:27.000> quick

speed test here to show you guys and

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:34.750 
speed test here to show you guys and
this<00:00:31.260> is<00:00:31.439> the<00:00:31.560> Nexus<00:00:31.980> 4<00:00:32.340> I<00:00:32.369> just<00:00:32.759> got<00:00:32.969> it<00:00:33.120> today

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:34.760 
this is the Nexus 4 I just got it today

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.209 
this is the Nexus 4 I just got it today
sorry<00:00:35.760> about<00:00:35.940> the<00:00:36.059> blurry<00:00:36.300> camera<00:00:37.129> so<00:00:38.129> I've

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
sorry about the blurry camera so I've

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.190 
sorry about the blurry camera so I've
been<00:00:38.309> getting<00:00:38.430> pretty<00:00:38.760> slow<00:00:38.969> speeds<00:00:39.390> you'll

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
been getting pretty slow speeds you'll

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.540 
been getting pretty slow speeds you'll
notice<00:00:40.500> there's<00:00:40.680> probably<00:00:40.890> about<00:00:41.040> one<00:00:41.309> to<00:00:41.520> two

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
notice there's probably about one to two

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:50.330 
notice there's probably about one to two
megabits<00:00:42.090> per<00:00:42.210> second<00:00:46.610> well<00:00:49.340> connections

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
megabits per second well connections

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.400 
megabits per second well connections
pretty<00:00:50.579> crappy<00:00:51.000> in<00:00:51.090> my<00:00:51.210> room<00:00:51.390> here<00:00:54.260> know<00:00:55.260> if

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
pretty crappy in my room here know if

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:56.689 
pretty crappy in my room here know if
you<00:00:55.500> guys<00:00:55.620> just<00:00:55.770> know<00:00:55.980> stuff<00:00:56.309> but<00:00:56.460> I've<00:00:56.550> been

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
you guys just know stuff but I've been

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.459 
you guys just know stuff but I've been
having<00:00:56.820> antenna<00:00:57.360> issues<00:00:57.780> I<00:00:57.899> think<00:00:58.140> this<00:00:58.260> phone

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
having antenna issues I think this phone

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:03.830 
having antenna issues I think this phone
actually<00:00:58.620> might<00:00:58.859> be<00:00:58.890> defective<00:00:59.780> but<00:01:02.840> so

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
actually might be defective but so

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.530 
actually might be defective but so
that's<00:01:04.019> the<00:01:04.320> speed<00:01:04.589> I'm<00:01:04.799> looking<00:01:05.189> out<00:01:05.339> here<00:01:05.640> so

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
that's the speed I'm looking out here so

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.420 
that's the speed I'm looking out here so
we'll<00:01:06.659> finish<00:01:06.869> this<00:01:07.140> test<00:01:07.439> off<00:01:07.710> and<00:01:08.040> then<00:01:08.310> I'll

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
we'll finish this test off and then I'll

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.010 
we'll finish this test off and then I'll
show<00:01:08.610> you<00:01:08.640> guys<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:08.909> difference<00:01:09.450> when<00:01:09.720> we<00:01:09.840> go

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
show you guys the difference when we go

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:17.660 
show you guys the difference when we go
to<00:01:11.720> LTE<00:01:15.920> so<00:01:16.920> as<00:01:17.009> you<00:01:17.130> can<00:01:17.220> see<00:01:17.400> it's<00:01:17.520> not<00:01:17.610> very

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
to LTE so as you can see it's not very

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.520 
to LTE so as you can see it's not very
fast<00:01:19.939> 1.6<00:01:20.939> 2<00:01:21.090> megabits<00:01:21.450> per<00:01:21.570> second<00:01:22.080> pretty

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
fast 1.6 2 megabits per second pretty

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.609 
fast 1.6 2 megabits per second pretty
disappointing<00:01:23.340> I<00:01:24.080> was<00:01:25.080> just<00:01:25.229> reading<00:01:25.380> the

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
disappointing I was just reading the

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.920 
disappointing I was just reading the
forum's<00:01:25.890> on<00:01:26.189> red<00:01:26.430> flag<00:01:26.729> deals<00:01:27.150> and<00:01:27.450> also<00:01:27.750> on

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
forum's on red flag deals and also on

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.569 
forum's on red flag deals and also on
XDA<00:01:28.350> and<00:01:28.619> a<00:01:28.650> lot<00:01:28.799> of<00:01:28.829> people<00:01:29.070> were<00:01:29.159> saying<00:01:29.400> they

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
XDA and a lot of people were saying they

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.649 
XDA and a lot of people were saying they
managed<00:01:29.850> to<00:01:29.880> get<00:01:30.150> LTE<00:01:30.869> speeds<00:01:31.380> somehow<00:01:32.659> so

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
managed to get LTE speeds somehow so

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:38.149 
managed to get LTE speeds somehow so
somebody<00:01:33.960> posted<00:01:34.409> a<00:01:36.350> like<00:01:37.350> star<00:01:37.619> command<00:01:37.950> to

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
somebody posted a like star command to

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.260 
somebody posted a like star command to
get<00:01:38.310> into<00:01:38.490> like<00:01:38.610> a<00:01:38.640> debug<00:01:39.090> menu<00:01:40.070> and<00:01:41.070> I<00:01:42.030> tried

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
get into like a debug menu and I tried

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:43.969 
get into like a debug menu and I tried
it<00:01:42.450> out<00:01:42.540> and<00:01:42.600> was<00:01:42.990> testing<00:01:43.320> a<00:01:43.380> few<00:01:43.409> things<00:01:43.799> and

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
it out and was testing a few things and

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.560 
it out and was testing a few things and
it<00:01:44.100> turned<00:01:44.310> out<00:01:44.430> actually<00:01:44.729> the<00:01:45.000> APN<00:01:45.540> settings

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
it turned out actually the APN settings

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.870 
it turned out actually the APN settings
are<00:01:46.200> what<00:01:46.380> I<00:01:46.439> needed<00:01:46.710> to<00:01:46.920> change<00:01:46.950> in<00:01:47.579> order<00:01:47.700> to

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
are what I needed to change in order to

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.520 
are what I needed to change in order to
access<00:01:48.090> the<00:01:48.390> LT<00:01:48.630> yet<00:01:48.840> first<00:01:49.079> I<00:01:49.200> thought<00:01:49.350> it<00:01:49.500> was

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
access the LT yet first I thought it was

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.850 
access the LT yet first I thought it was
a<00:01:49.619> scam<00:01:50.540> but<00:01:51.540> it<00:01:51.689> appears<00:01:51.990> to<00:01:52.079> be<00:01:52.259> real<00:01:52.530> so<00:01:52.829> I

just gonna get out of this you guys get
the<00:01:59.909> idea<00:02:00.920> 1.6<00:02:01.920> megabits<00:02:02.340> per<00:02:02.399> second<00:02:02.850> down<00:02:03.590> so

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
the idea 1.6 megabits per second down so

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.709 
the idea 1.6 megabits per second down so
what<00:02:04.799> I'm<00:02:04.920> gonna<00:02:05.040> do<00:02:05.310> now<00:02:05.579> is<00:02:05.880> I'm<00:02:06.299> going<00:02:06.420> to<00:02:06.479> go

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
so you'll notice it's on gsm auto right

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.590 
so you'll notice it's on gsm auto right
now<00:02:16.880> I'm<00:02:17.120> gonna<00:02:17.240> change<00:02:17.510> that<00:02:17.750> to<00:02:17.810> LTE<00:02:18.560> only<00:02:19.600> so

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:20.600 
now I'm gonna change that to LTE only so

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.180 
now I'm gonna change that to LTE only so
right<00:02:20.810> away<00:02:20.930> you'll<00:02:21.290> see<00:02:21.470> on<00:02:21.620> the<00:02:21.740> top<00:02:21.950> that

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190 
right away you'll see on the top that

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:27.460 
right away you'll see on the top that
the<00:02:22.340> signal<00:02:22.700> will<00:02:22.819> change<00:02:22.870> from<00:02:23.870> 3G<00:02:24.140> to<00:02:26.470> just

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
the signal will change from 3G to just

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:34.360 
the signal will change from 3G to just
two<00:02:28.100> gray<00:02:28.370> bars<00:02:28.700> with<00:02:29.060> no<00:02:29.140> actual<00:02:32.920> no<00:02:33.920> actual

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
two gray bars with no actual no actual

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.240 
two gray bars with no actual no actual
connection<00:02:34.970> which<00:02:35.420> is<00:02:35.600> what<00:02:36.380> I<00:02:36.410> tried<00:02:36.500> rigidly

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
connection which is what I tried rigidly

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:38.650 
connection which is what I tried rigidly
and<00:02:37.459> I<00:02:37.520> can<00:02:37.700> figure<00:02:37.940> out<00:02:38.000> what<00:02:38.240> was<00:02:38.420> wrong<00:02:38.450> and

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660 
and I can figure out what was wrong and

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:41.680 
and I can figure out what was wrong and
I<00:02:38.930> figured<00:02:39.200> it<00:02:39.290> must<00:02:39.410> be<00:02:39.590> a<00:02:39.620> scam<00:02:40.570> sorry<00:02:41.570> about

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:41.690 
I figured it must be a scam sorry about

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:43.210 
I figured it must be a scam sorry about
the<00:02:41.810> cameras<00:02:42.170> blurry<00:02:42.440> I<00:02:42.530> don't<00:02:42.770> know<00:02:42.830> why<00:02:43.010> it's

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
the cameras blurry I don't know why it's

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:44.460 
the cameras blurry I don't know why it's
doing<00:02:43.280> that

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
doing that

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:47.229 
doing that
but<00:02:45.470> the<00:02:45.739> actual<00:02:46.070> difference<00:02:46.640> here<00:02:46.910> is<00:02:47.060> what

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:47.239 
but the actual difference here is what

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:56.520 
but the actual difference here is what
we<00:02:47.360> need<00:02:47.510> to<00:02:47.630> do<00:02:47.840> is<00:02:48.140> go<00:02:48.350> into<00:02:49.030> settings<00:02:50.030> and

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:00.880 

sorry<00:02:57.620> we're<00:02:58.130> going<00:02:58.370> to<00:02:58.519> networks<00:02:59.060> and<00:02:59.890> I

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890 
sorry we're going to networks and I

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:04.360 
sorry we're going to networks and I
actually<00:03:01.070> created<00:03:01.580> a<00:03:01.820> new<00:03:01.970> APN<00:03:03.250> for<00:03:04.250> the

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370 
actually created a new APN for the

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:09.699 
actually created a new APN for the
Rogers<00:03:04.760> LTE<00:03:05.420> APN<00:03:06.019> which<00:03:06.200> is<00:03:06.350> different<00:03:08.709> it's

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:09.709 
Rogers LTE APN which is different it's

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:10.960 
Rogers LTE APN which is different it's
right<00:03:09.950> here<00:03:10.160> so<00:03:10.340> we're<00:03:10.459> just<00:03:10.489> going<00:03:10.730> to<00:03:10.790> select

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:10.970 
right here so we're just going to select

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:15.729 
right here so we're just going to select
that<00:03:13.269> you'll<00:03:14.269> now<00:03:14.420> notice<00:03:14.720> at<00:03:15.019> the<00:03:15.110> top<00:03:15.380> it

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:15.739 
that you'll now notice at the top it

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:17.890 
that you'll now notice at the top it
says<00:03:15.769> 4G<00:03:16.760> might<00:03:17.239> be<00:03:17.360> a<00:03:17.390> little<00:03:17.570> bit<00:03:17.660> hard<00:03:17.840> to

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:17.900 
says 4G might be a little bit hard to

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:24.750 
says 4G might be a little bit hard to
read<00:03:18.200> I<00:03:21.579> don't<00:03:22.579> know<00:03:22.760> if<00:03:22.820> you<00:03:22.940> can<00:03:23.090> read<00:03:23.269> that

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:24.760 
read I don't know if you can read that

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:28.920 
read I don't know if you can read that
stupid<00:03:25.760> camera

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:28.930 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:33.309 

you'll<00:03:29.930> notice<00:03:30.200> there's<00:03:30.379> two<00:03:30.440> bars<00:03:30.920> of<00:03:31.069> 4G<00:03:32.319> so

00:03:33.309 --> 00:03:33.319 
you'll notice there's two bars of 4G so

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:36.130 
you'll notice there's two bars of 4G so
what<00:03:33.470> I'm<00:03:33.560> gonna<00:03:33.680> do<00:03:33.920> now<00:03:34.129> is<00:03:34.959> we're<00:03:35.959> now

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:36.140 
what I'm gonna do now is we're now

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:38.949 
what I'm gonna do now is we're now
connected<00:03:36.560> to<00:03:36.590> HSPA<00:03:37.220> Network<00:03:37.670> so<00:03:38.659> what<00:03:38.840> I'm

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:38.959 
connected to HSPA Network so what I'm

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:41.229 
connected to HSPA Network so what I'm
going<00:03:39.140> to<00:03:39.230> do<00:03:39.470> is<00:03:39.830> a<00:03:39.860> quick<00:03:40.280> speed<00:03:40.640> test<00:03:40.940> again

00:03:41.229 --> 00:03:41.239 
going to do is a quick speed test again

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:58.680 
going to do is a quick speed test again
and<00:03:41.510> you<00:03:42.500> guys<00:03:42.680> will<00:03:42.890> see<00:03:42.920> the<00:03:43.220> difference

00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:58.690 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:03.840 

so<00:03:59.200> it's<00:03:59.350> not<00:03:59.500> exactly<00:03:59.680> as<00:04:00.490> fast<00:04:01.030> as<00:04:02.640> you<00:04:03.640> might

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:03.850 
so it's not exactly as fast as you might

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:05.970 
so it's not exactly as fast as you might
expect<00:04:03.970> but<00:04:04.420> hey<00:04:04.570> that's<00:04:04.810> 9<00:04:05.080> times<00:04:05.110> faster

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:05.980 
expect but hey that's 9 times faster

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:07.760 
expect but hey that's 9 times faster
than<00:04:06.070> what<00:04:06.190> I<00:04:06.250> was<00:04:06.400> getting<00:04:06.640> before<00:04:06.760> so

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:07.770 
than what I was getting before so

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:10.490 
than what I was getting before so
definitely<00:04:08.770> not<00:04:08.920> a<00:04:08.950> scam<00:04:09.130> guys<00:04:09.490> this<00:04:09.790> is<00:04:09.940> legit

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 
definitely not a scam guys this is legit

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:14.460 
definitely not a scam guys this is legit
I<00:04:11.940> don't<00:04:12.940> know<00:04:13.150> what's<00:04:13.690> going<00:04:13.960> on<00:04:14.110> or<00:04:14.320> what's

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:14.470 
I don't know what's going on or what's

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:17.490 
I don't know what's going on or what's
really<00:04:14.830> happening<00:04:15.220> here<00:04:15.280> but<00:04:16.380> if<00:04:17.380> you

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:17.500 
really happening here but if you

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:20.880 
really happening here but if you
actually<00:04:17.680> go<00:04:17.860> back<00:04:18.190> into<00:04:18.220> this<00:04:18.580> debug<00:04:19.000> menu

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:20.890 
actually go back into this debug menu

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:27.000 
actually go back into this debug menu
you<00:04:21.459> will<00:04:21.640> see<00:04:22.590> that<00:04:23.590> Eclipse<00:04:25.920> according<00:04:26.920> to

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:27.010 
you will see that Eclipse according to

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:32.190 
you will see that Eclipse according to
this<00:04:27.280> I'm<00:04:28.210> in<00:04:28.450> LTE<00:04:28.900> network<00:04:29.560> type<00:04:30.480> and<00:04:31.480> that's

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:32.200 
this I'm in LTE network type and that's

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:34.380 
this I'm in LTE network type and that's
because<00:04:32.470> I've<00:04:32.620> chosen<00:04:32.800> LTE<00:04:33.370> only<00:04:33.910> so<00:04:34.120> this

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:34.390 
because I've chosen LTE only so this

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:37.170 
because I've chosen LTE only so this
does<00:04:34.630> appear<00:04:34.930> to<00:04:34.990> be<00:04:35.110> legit<00:04:36.000> Rodgers<00:04:37.000> in

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:37.180 
does appear to be legit Rodgers in

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:40.650 
does appear to be legit Rodgers in
Canada<00:04:37.660> has<00:04:37.840> HSPA<00:04:38.530> 21<00:04:39.100> megabits<00:04:39.550> per<00:04:39.610> second<00:04:40.150> I

Canada has HSPA 21 megabits per second I

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:42.750 
Canada has HSPA 21 megabits per second I
know<00:04:41.350> some<00:04:41.620> people<00:04:41.740> showed<00:04:42.100> this<00:04:42.310> off<00:04:42.490> on<00:04:42.670> the

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:42.760 
know some people showed this off on the

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:44.550 
know some people showed this off on the
Telus<00:04:43.030> Network<00:04:43.360> which<00:04:43.510> is<00:04:43.660> 42<00:04:43.960> megabits<00:04:44.470> per

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:44.560 
Telus Network which is 42 megabits per

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:46.050 
Telus Network which is 42 megabits per
second<00:04:45.010> and<00:04:45.070> people<00:04:45.430> were<00:04:45.520> saying<00:04:45.730> oh<00:04:45.850> that's

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:46.060 
second and people were saying oh that's

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:48.090 
second and people were saying oh that's
probably<00:04:46.300> just<00:04:46.450> dual<00:04:46.660> channel<00:04:47.050> HSPA<00:04:47.530> but<00:04:47.860> I

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:48.100 
probably just dual channel HSPA but I

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:49.860 
probably just dual channel HSPA but I
don't<00:04:48.790> think<00:04:48.940> that's<00:04:49.090> the<00:04:49.240> case<00:04:49.390> here<00:04:49.450> because

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:49.870 
don't think that's the case here because

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:51.720 
don't think that's the case here because
Rogers<00:04:50.230> doesn't<00:04:50.500> have<00:04:50.620> dual<00:04:50.860> channel<00:04:51.220> HSPA

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:51.730 
Rogers doesn't have dual channel HSPA

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:53.790 
Rogers doesn't have dual channel HSPA
and<00:04:52.000> I've<00:04:52.660> been<00:04:52.810> getting<00:04:52.930> constantly<00:04:53.590> 1

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:53.800 
and I've been getting constantly 1

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.560 
and I've been getting constantly 1
megabit<00:04:54.160> per<00:04:54.220> second<00:04:54.670> all<00:04:54.760> day<00:04:54.970> and<00:04:55.210> now<00:04:55.390> I'm

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:55.570 
megabit per second all day and now I'm

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:58.110 
megabit per second all day and now I'm
getting<00:04:55.870> 10<00:04:56.430> let's<00:04:57.430> try<00:04:57.610> that<00:04:57.760> one<00:04:57.970> more<00:04:58.000> time

00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:58.120 
getting 10 let's try that one more time

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:04.740

LTE or some form of it and that's a

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:32.170 
LTE or some form of it and that's a
freebie<00:05:31.099> because<00:05:31.520> that<00:05:31.669> was<00:05:31.819> one<00:05:32.000> of<00:05:32.090> the

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:32.180
