00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
little bit of meat that you have to

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:11.600 
little bit of meat that you have to
slice<00:01:02.969> down<00:01:03.000> along<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:03.989> rib<00:01:04.409> cage<00:01:04.619> here

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.649

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:30.060 
other side you break the base of the rib
cage<00:01:20.280> I'll<00:01:21.280> try<00:01:21.520> to<00:01:21.579> get<00:01:21.759> so<00:01:21.939> you<00:01:22.000> can<00:01:22.149> see<00:01:22.329> here

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:30.070 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:32.109 

then<00:01:31.070> you're<00:01:31.159> going<00:01:31.250> to<00:01:31.340> slice<00:01:31.579> down<00:01:31.850> along

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:32.119

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 
the rib cage and I'm slicing through a

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:40.980 
the rib cage and I'm slicing through a
little<00:01:35.090> roll<00:01:35.720> bones<00:01:35.960> that<00:01:36.170> we<00:01:36.229> take<00:01:36.439> out<00:01:36.619> later

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:40.990
