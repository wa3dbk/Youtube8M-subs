that maybe I was interested before the

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.370 
that maybe I was interested before the
whole<00:01:05.549> packaging<00:01:06.119> thing<00:01:06.299> but<00:01:06.479> wasn't<00:01:06.990> like<00:01:07.140> oh

I'm definitely going I'm making the trip
and<00:01:10.110> everything<00:01:10.530> and<00:01:10.939> well<00:01:11.939> it's<00:01:12.090> not<00:01:12.210> really

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
and everything and well it's not really

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.210 
and everything and well it's not really
a<00:01:12.570> trip<00:01:12.840> it's<00:01:13.020> really<00:01:13.560> like<00:01:13.770> only<00:01:14.010> five

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
a trip it's really like only five

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.690 
a trip it's really like only five
minutes<00:01:14.369> but<00:01:15.000> anyway<00:01:15.540> I<00:01:16.340> thought<00:01:17.340> I<00:01:17.640> would

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
minutes but anyway I thought I would

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.969 
minutes but anyway I thought I would
really<00:01:18.030> like<00:01:18.210> this<00:01:18.390> brand<00:01:18.720> and<00:01:19.020> really<00:01:19.290> I<00:01:19.619> hate

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
really like this brand and really I hate

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.929 
really like this brand and really I hate
it<00:01:20.130> and<00:01:20.340> I<00:01:21.210> mean<00:01:21.659> it<00:01:21.900> has<00:01:22.259> nothing<00:01:22.590> to<00:01:23.340> do<00:01:23.549> with

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
it and I mean it has nothing to do with

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.240 
it and I mean it has nothing to do with
just<00:01:24.689> like<00:01:25.049> the<00:01:25.259> hype<00:01:25.470> of<00:01:25.500> it<00:01:25.830> or<00:01:26.040> anything

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
just like the hype of it or anything

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.249 
just like the hype of it or anything
well<00:01:26.610> I<00:01:26.640> think<00:01:26.790> it<00:01:27.090> is<00:01:27.210> kind<00:01:27.570> of<00:01:27.630> a<00:01:27.840> little<00:01:28.110> bit

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
well I think it is kind of a little bit

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.819 
well I think it is kind of a little bit
overhyped<00:01:28.770> to<00:01:29.040> tell<00:01:29.220> you<00:01:29.340> the<00:01:29.520> truth<00:01:29.549> but<00:01:30.299> and
