seem to be a fantastic partner for

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.310 
seem to be a fantastic partner for
developing<00:00:43.379> a<00:00:43.469> new<00:00:43.710> wheel<00:00:43.950> which<00:00:44.340> was<00:00:44.610> both

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:45.320 
developing a new wheel which was both

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.380 
developing a new wheel which was both
combined<00:00:46.399> my<00:00:47.399> aerodynamic<00:00:47.940> knowledge<00:00:48.239> in

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
combined my aerodynamic knowledge in

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:49.940 
combined my aerodynamic knowledge in

there and their composite knowledge to

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.520 
there and their composite knowledge to
produce<00:00:50.100> a<00:00:50.520> really<00:00:51.239> efficient<00:00:51.809> product<00:00:52.410> I

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
produce a really efficient product I

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.340 
produce a really efficient product I
think<00:00:52.770> that's<00:00:53.930> light

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
think that's light

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.619 
think that's light

00:00:59.619 --> 00:00:59.629 
stiff stable in the wind and and fast

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:01.849 
stiff stable in the wind and and fast
this<00:01:00.629> is<00:01:00.809> that<00:01:00.960> this<00:01:01.079> is<00:01:01.230> the<00:01:01.350> first<00:01:01.620> of<00:01:01.800> a

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
this is that this is the first of a

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.100 
this is that this is the first of a
range<00:01:02.100> of<00:01:02.309> three<00:01:02.969> wheel<00:01:03.180> sets<00:01:03.510> that<00:01:03.719> we<00:01:03.870> have

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
range of three wheel sets that we have

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.590 
range of three wheel sets that we have
coming<00:01:04.379> on<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:04.589> market<00:01:04.769> very<00:01:05.460> soon<00:01:05.580> we<00:01:06.450> have

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
coming on the market very soon we have

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.710 
coming on the market very soon we have
it<00:01:06.720> a<00:01:06.780> 60<00:01:07.170> millimeter<00:01:07.530> front<00:01:07.920> rim<00:01:08.189> and<00:01:08.939> a<00:01:08.970> 70

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
it a 60 millimeter front rim and a 70

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.530 
it a 60 millimeter front rim and a 70
millimeter<00:01:10.049> rear<00:01:10.320> rim<00:01:11.000> they're<00:01:12.000> also<00:01:12.150> both

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
millimeter rear rim they're also both

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.200 
millimeter rear rim they're also both
different<00:01:12.810> shapes<00:01:13.610> that<00:01:14.610> the<00:01:14.760> front<00:01:15.030> wheel<00:01:15.180> is

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
different shapes that the front wheel is

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.899 
different shapes that the front wheel is
actually<00:01:15.509> slightly<00:01:15.930> wider<00:01:16.320> and<00:01:16.909> 26

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
actually slightly wider and 26

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.880 
actually slightly wider and 26
millimeters<00:01:18.390> at<00:01:18.509> the<00:01:18.600> brake<00:01:18.780> track<00:01:19.049> and<00:01:19.320> the

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
millimeters at the brake track and the

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.760 
millimeters at the brake track and the
rear<00:01:20.070> is<00:01:20.369> 24<00:01:21.150> at<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:21.540> brain<00:01:21.750> track<00:01:22.020> and<00:01:22.650> the

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
rear is 24 at the brain track and the

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.320 
rear is 24 at the brain track and the
reason<00:01:23.040> for<00:01:23.220> this<00:01:23.310> is<00:01:23.520> we<00:01:23.820> kind<00:01:24.210> of

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
reason for this is we kind of

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:25.850 
reason for this is we kind of
fundamentally<00:01:24.990> addressed<00:01:25.439> the<00:01:25.680> wing

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
fundamentally addressed the wing

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.130 
fundamentally addressed the wing
development<00:01:26.400> differently<00:01:26.820> we<00:01:27.030> came<00:01:27.810> into<00:01:27.990> the

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
development differently we came into the

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.630 
development differently we came into the
market<00:01:28.500> and<00:01:28.680> realized<00:01:29.280> that<00:01:29.430> you<00:01:29.549> know

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
market and realized that you know

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.480 
market and realized that you know
there's<00:01:29.850> some<00:01:30.630> really<00:01:30.840> good<00:01:31.220> wheels<00:01:32.220> out

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
there's some really good wheels out

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.490 
there's some really good wheels out
there<00:01:32.700> that<00:01:32.909> had<00:01:33.479> a<00:01:33.509> lot<00:01:33.720> of<00:01:33.750> development<00:01:34.290> over

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
there that had a lot of development over

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.289 
there that had a lot of development over
the<00:01:34.590> years<00:01:34.860> and<00:01:35.070> a<00:01:35.250> huge<00:01:35.700> lot<00:01:35.939> of<00:01:36.030> air

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
the years and a huge lot of air

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.870 
the years and a huge lot of air
resources<00:01:36.960> already<00:01:37.170> gone<00:01:37.470> into<00:01:37.770> them<00:01:37.920> but<00:01:38.700> I

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
resources already gone into them but I

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.429 
resources already gone into them but I
think<00:01:39.090> the<00:01:39.180> difference<00:01:39.479> is<00:01:39.600> that<00:01:39.659> wheels<00:01:40.200> in

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
think the difference is that wheels in

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.800 
think the difference is that wheels in
the<00:01:40.530> past<00:01:40.770> of<00:01:41.009> whose<00:01:41.189> be<00:01:41.520> started<00:01:42.240> as<00:01:42.450> a<00:01:42.479> wheel

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
the past of whose be started as a wheel

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.719 
the past of whose be started as a wheel
in<00:01:43.290> a<00:01:43.439> wind<00:01:43.649> tunnel<00:01:43.710> from<00:01:44.070> an<00:01:44.159> error<00:01:44.369> variance

in a wind tunnel from an error variance
perspective<00:01:45.540> but<00:01:46.320> from<00:01:46.829> my<00:01:46.950> background<00:01:47.220> in

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
perspective but from my background in

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.550 
perspective but from my background in
Formula<00:01:48.090> one<00:01:48.299> where<00:01:48.540> we<00:01:48.689> think<00:01:48.869> much<00:01:49.170> more<00:01:49.409> the

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
Formula one where we think much more the

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.520 
Formula one where we think much more the
system<00:01:50.009> and<00:01:50.189> the<00:01:50.250> interaction<00:01:50.939> of<00:01:51.000> everything

system and the interaction of everything

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.620 
system and the interaction of everything
we<00:01:52.530> felt<00:01:52.799> that<00:01:52.860> we<00:01:53.520> could<00:01:53.549> find<00:01:53.970> an<00:01:54.119> advantage

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
we felt that we could find an advantage

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.999 
we felt that we could find an advantage
by<00:01:55.280> deriving<00:01:56.280> a<00:01:56.520> new<00:01:56.759> test<00:01:57.479> protocol<00:01:58.049> and<00:01:58.290> as

you<00:01:59.159> develop<00:01:59.280> in<00:01:59.700> the<00:01:59.790> wheels<00:01:59.969> in<00:02:00.299> the<00:02:00.509> bicycle

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
you develop in the wheels in the bicycle

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.920 
you develop in the wheels in the bicycle
and<00:02:01.229> so<00:02:02.009> for<00:02:02.219> that<00:02:02.280> reason<00:02:02.420> the<00:02:03.420> rear<00:02:03.600> isn't

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
and so for that reason the rear isn't

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.200 
and so for that reason the rear isn't
just<00:02:04.079> a<00:02:04.170> different<00:02:04.500> death<00:02:05.070> it's<00:02:05.520> a<00:02:05.790> different

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
just a different death it's a different

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.059 
just a different death it's a different
shape<00:02:06.630> because<00:02:07.200> it<00:02:07.350> sees<00:02:07.530> a<00:02:07.560> different<00:02:07.890> flow

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
shape because it sees a different flow

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:09.889 
shape because it sees a different flow
field<00:02:08.340> so<00:02:08.610> that<00:02:08.640> the<00:02:09.090> front<00:02:09.390> wheel<00:02:09.569> is<00:02:09.780> it

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
field so that the front wheel is it

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.750 
field so that the front wheel is it
tends<00:02:10.110> to<00:02:10.170> be<00:02:10.319> slightly<00:02:10.560> wider<00:02:10.920> so

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
tends to be slightly wider so

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.820 
tends to be slightly wider so
of<00:02:11.819> the<00:02:11.970> flow<00:02:12.150> attachment<00:02:12.780> around<00:02:13.200> the

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
of the flow attachment around the

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.559 
of the flow attachment around the
cleaner<00:02:14.099> air<00:02:14.370> around<00:02:14.939> the<00:02:15.030> front<00:02:15.269> that<00:02:15.390> lead

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
cleaner air around the front that lead

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:17.630 
cleaner air around the front that lead
leading<00:02:15.870> edge<00:02:15.959> of<00:02:15.989> the<00:02:16.230> tire<00:02:16.530> as<00:02:16.769> it<00:02:17.099> as<00:02:17.430> it

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
leading edge of the tire as it as it

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.819 
leading edge of the tire as it as it
actually<00:02:17.849> riding<00:02:18.510> along<00:02:18.780> in<00:02:18.810> a<00:02:19.170> crosswind<00:02:19.620> and

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:19.829 
actually riding along in a crosswind and

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:22.069 
actually riding along in a crosswind and
of<00:02:20.310> course<00:02:20.519> the<00:02:20.730> rear<00:02:21.239> wheel<00:02:21.450> doesn't<00:02:21.720> see

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:22.079 
of course the rear wheel doesn't see

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:24.800 
of course the rear wheel doesn't see
such<00:02:23.010> a<00:02:23.040> an<00:02:23.430> angle<00:02:23.730> of<00:02:23.790> attack<00:02:23.909> there<00:02:24.450> because

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
such a an angle of attack there because

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.539 
such a an angle of attack there because
of<00:02:24.930> the<00:02:25.049> the<00:02:25.230> seat<00:02:25.439> supernal<00:02:25.920> the<00:02:26.040> shielding

00:02:26.539 --> 00:02:26.549 
of the the seat supernal the shielding

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:28.430 
of the the seat supernal the shielding
so<00:02:27.299> there's<00:02:27.540> there's<00:02:27.750> a<00:02:27.810> lot<00:02:27.959> of<00:02:28.110> things<00:02:28.290> that

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
so there's there's a lot of things that

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.259 
so there's there's a lot of things that
gone<00:02:28.920> on<00:02:29.069> in<00:02:29.190> the<00:02:29.280> design<00:02:29.579> in<00:02:29.849> the<00:02:29.940> front<00:02:30.060> of

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:30.269 
gone on in the design in the front of

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:32.030 
gone on in the design in the front of
the<00:02:30.329> rear<00:02:30.510> wheel<00:02:30.959> the<00:02:31.170> to<00:02:31.500> make<00:02:31.680> it<00:02:31.829> different

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
the rear wheel the to make it different

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.199 
the rear wheel the to make it different
and<00:02:32.340> that's<00:02:32.519> how<00:02:32.730> we've<00:02:32.879> been<00:02:32.970> able<00:02:33.060> to

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.209 
and that's how we've been able to

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:35.720 
and that's how we've been able to
improve<00:02:33.629> the<00:02:34.470> and<00:02:34.829> optimize<00:02:35.340> the<00:02:35.579> performance

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
improve the and optimize the performance

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.949 
improve the and optimize the performance
of<00:02:36.420> a<00:02:36.840> wheel<00:02:37.019> set<00:02:37.609> the<00:02:38.609> the<00:02:38.640> other<00:02:39.000> key<00:02:39.450> area

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 
of a wheel set the the other key area

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:42.979 
of a wheel set the the other key area
that<00:02:40.019> we've<00:02:40.349> really<00:02:41.040> identified<00:02:41.329> from<00:02:42.329> the<00:02:42.540> an

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:42.989 
that we've really identified from the an

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:46.610 
that we've really identified from the an
aerodynamic<00:02:43.560> perspective<00:02:44.099> is<00:02:44.340> that<00:02:45.620> there's

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
aerodynamic perspective is that there's

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.910 
aerodynamic perspective is that there's
two<00:02:46.950> key<00:02:47.220> metrics<00:02:47.670> to<00:02:47.909> -<00:02:48.349> aerodynamics<00:02:49.349> so<00:02:49.560> one

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
two key metrics to - aerodynamics so one

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.759 
two key metrics to - aerodynamics so one
is<00:02:50.069> the<00:02:50.730> totals<00:02:51.569> will<00:02:51.750> drag<00:02:52.049> and<00:02:52.290> speed<00:02:52.590> that

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:52.769 
is the totals will drag and speed that

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:54.500 
is the totals will drag and speed that
you<00:02:52.950> associate<00:02:53.489> with<00:02:53.670> an<00:02:53.760> error<00:02:53.940> error<00:02:54.239> wheel

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
you associate with an error error wheel

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.110 
you associate with an error error wheel
but<00:02:54.720> also<00:02:54.870> that<00:02:55.260> to<00:02:55.739> realize<00:02:56.010> the<00:02:56.909> ride

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
but also that to realize the ride

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.420 
but also that to realize the ride
ability<00:02:57.569> is<00:02:57.720> absolutely<00:02:58.170> key<00:02:58.409> and<00:02:58.680> that's

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
ability is absolutely key and that's

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.259 
ability is absolutely key and that's
because<00:02:59.819> in<00:03:00.420> a<00:03:00.930> crosswind<00:03:01.500> you<00:03:01.650> tend<00:03:01.920> to<00:03:02.010> get

00:03:02.259 --> 00:03:02.269 
because in a crosswind you tend to get

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:05.780 
because in a crosswind you tend to get
different<00:03:03.269> pressure<00:03:04.049> build-up<00:03:04.500> I<00:03:04.680> mean<00:03:04.829> it's

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
different pressure build-up I mean it's

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:07.430 
different pressure build-up I mean it's
the<00:03:06.030> wheels<00:03:06.629> on<00:03:06.780> to<00:03:06.900> break<00:03:07.049> look<00:03:07.230> very

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
the wheels on to break look very

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.110 
the wheels on to break look very
complicated<00:03:07.920> but<00:03:08.099> in<00:03:08.250> simple<00:03:08.459> terms<00:03:08.819> you<00:03:08.940> can

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
complicated but in simple terms you can

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.460 
complicated but in simple terms you can
imagine<00:03:09.329> that<00:03:09.540> you're<00:03:09.810> you<00:03:10.170> you're<00:03:10.349> getting

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
imagine that you're you you're getting

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:13.160 
imagine that you're you you're getting
low<00:03:11.430> low<00:03:11.730> pressure<00:03:12.030> build<00:03:12.269> up<00:03:12.389> on<00:03:12.569> on<00:03:12.840> two

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
low low pressure build up on on two

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.020 
low low pressure build up on on two
sides<00:03:13.409> of<00:03:13.620> the<00:03:14.190> front<00:03:14.430> and<00:03:14.609> the<00:03:14.670> rear<00:03:14.700> of<00:03:14.879> the

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
sides of the front and the rear of the

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:16.970 
sides of the front and the rear of the
wheel<00:03:15.180> and<00:03:15.569> that's<00:03:16.019> what<00:03:16.290> tends<00:03:16.590> to<00:03:16.680> cause

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
wheel and that's what tends to cause

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.369 
wheel and that's what tends to cause
this<00:03:17.190> some<00:03:17.459> these<00:03:18.060> oscillations<00:03:18.569> and<00:03:19.109> and

00:03:19.369 --> 00:03:19.379 
this some these oscillations and and

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:21.259 
this some these oscillations and and
nervin<00:03:19.949> experiences<00:03:20.579> that<00:03:20.730> some<00:03:20.940> people<00:03:21.180> have

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:21.269 
nervin experiences that some people have

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:23.720 
nervin experiences that some people have
had<00:03:21.359> in<00:03:21.510> the<00:03:21.599> past<00:03:21.629> when<00:03:22.109> riding<00:03:22.379> a<00:03:22.889> winning<00:03:23.459> in

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
had in the past when riding a winning in

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:25.129 
had in the past when riding a winning in
gusty<00:03:24.090> conditions<00:03:24.120> which<00:03:24.720> makes<00:03:24.959> them

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:25.139 
gusty conditions which makes them

00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:27.740 
gusty conditions which makes them
dangerous<00:03:25.440> and<00:03:25.949> not<00:03:26.069> really<00:03:26.370> usable<00:03:26.699> so<00:03:27.569> we

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
dangerous and not really usable so we

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:30.470 
dangerous and not really usable so we
work<00:03:28.019> very<00:03:28.049> hard<00:03:28.319> to<00:03:28.889> tune<00:03:29.730> the<00:03:29.940> shape<00:03:30.209> of<00:03:30.419> the

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
work very hard to tune the shape of the

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:33.680 
work very hard to tune the shape of the
wheel<00:03:30.660> so<00:03:31.290> you<00:03:31.560> when<00:03:32.430> you<00:03:32.639> pass<00:03:33.030> these<00:03:33.299> these

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
wheel so you when you pass these these

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:36.830 
wheel so you when you pass these these
unsteady<00:03:34.169> conditions<00:03:34.760> out<00:03:35.760> on<00:03:36.060> the<00:03:36.180> road<00:03:36.389> is

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
unsteady conditions out on the road is

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:38.300 
unsteady conditions out on the road is
that<00:03:37.079> you<00:03:37.169> actually<00:03:37.290> have<00:03:37.590> a<00:03:37.620> stabilizing

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
that you actually have a stabilizing

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:40.069 
that you actually have a stabilizing
effect<00:03:38.549> and<00:03:39.030> it<00:03:39.329> doesn't<00:03:39.629> throw<00:03:39.840> you<00:03:39.900> off

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:40.079 
effect and it doesn't throw you off

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:43.099 
effect and it doesn't throw you off
course<00:03:40.430> so<00:03:41.430> that<00:03:41.459> that's<00:03:42.419> a<00:03:42.629> result<00:03:42.750> of<00:03:42.989> the

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:43.109 
course so that that's a result of the

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:45.229

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940 
have sort of four metrics that we've

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:06.110 
have sort of four metrics that we've
tried<00:04:03.180> to<00:04:03.209> trade<00:04:04.220> to<00:04:05.220> get<00:04:05.370> to<00:04:05.519> get<00:04:05.639> the<00:04:05.760> most

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
tried to trade to get to get the most

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:07.280 
tried to trade to get to get the most
efficient<00:04:06.540> win<00:04:06.629> I<00:04:06.720> like<00:04:06.870> the<00:04:06.989> thing<00:04:07.169> we're

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290 
efficient win I like the thing we're

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:09.339 
efficient win I like the thing we're
really<00:04:07.440> really<00:04:07.739> pleased<00:04:07.979> with<00:04:08.159> a<00:04:08.280> fun<00:04:08.790> product

00:04:09.339 --> 00:04:09.349 
really really pleased with a fun product

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:13.390 
really really pleased with a fun product
some<00:04:10.349> you<00:04:10.769> do<00:04:11.459> you<00:04:11.549> recommend<00:04:12.000> a<00:04:12.239> certain<00:04:12.659> tire

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:13.400 
some you do you recommend a certain tire

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:17.210 
some you do you recommend a certain tire
do<00:04:14.400> you<00:04:14.519> find<00:04:14.790> anything<00:04:15.500> yeah<00:04:16.500> that's<00:04:17.070> a<00:04:17.130> good

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220 
do you find anything yeah that's a good

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:19.670 
do you find anything yeah that's a good
point<00:04:17.430> I<00:04:17.579> mean<00:04:17.609> you<00:04:17.970> know<00:04:18.120> if<00:04:18.269> for<00:04:19.199> this<00:04:19.320> for

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680 
point I mean you know if for this for

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:22.399 
point I mean you know if for this for
this<00:04:19.769> first<00:04:20.070> project<00:04:20.340> we<00:04:20.729> it<00:04:21.690> was<00:04:21.870> a<00:04:21.900> big<00:04:22.139> step

00:04:22.399 --> 00:04:22.409 
this first project we it was a big step

00:04:22.409 --> 00:04:24.570 
this first project we it was a big step
to<00:04:22.620> say<00:04:22.830> let's<00:04:23.159> try<00:04:23.550> to<00:04:23.610> develop

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:24.580 
to say let's try to develop

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:27.749 
to say let's try to develop
a<00:04:24.639> wheel<00:04:25.539> set<00:04:25.870> that<00:04:26.080> works<00:04:27.009> better<00:04:27.340> in<00:04:27.610> all

00:04:27.749 --> 00:04:27.759 
a wheel set that works better in all

00:04:27.759 --> 00:04:29.279 
a wheel set that works better in all
frames<00:04:28.090> and<00:04:28.479> that<00:04:28.569> was<00:04:28.720> quite<00:04:28.990> a<00:04:29.020> big

00:04:29.279 --> 00:04:29.289 
frames and that was quite a big

00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:31.230 
frames and that was quite a big
statement<00:04:29.800> you<00:04:30.370> can<00:04:30.520> imagine<00:04:30.699> the<00:04:30.970> kind<00:04:31.180> of

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:31.240 
statement you can imagine the kind of

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:32.670 
statement you can imagine the kind of
huge<00:04:31.479> test<00:04:31.780> matrix<00:04:31.990> you<00:04:32.259> could<00:04:32.409> come<00:04:32.560> up<00:04:32.650> with

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:32.680 
huge test matrix you could come up with

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:35.100 
huge test matrix you could come up with
you<00:04:32.919> try<00:04:33.159> to<00:04:33.219> design<00:04:33.430> wheels<00:04:33.849> for<00:04:34.110> specific

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:35.110 
you try to design wheels for specific

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:36.719 
you try to design wheels for specific
bikes<00:04:35.319> and<00:04:35.620> then<00:04:35.740> on<00:04:35.889> top<00:04:36.099> of<00:04:36.159> that<00:04:36.370> you<00:04:36.550> can

00:04:36.719 --> 00:04:36.729 
bikes and then on top of that you can

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:40.890 
bikes and then on top of that you can
add<00:04:36.879> in<00:04:37.139> different<00:04:38.139> tires<00:04:38.379> as<00:04:38.680> well<00:04:38.710> so<00:04:39.900> we

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:40.900 
add in different tires as well so we

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:43.379 
add in different tires as well so we
certainly<00:04:41.409> believe<00:04:41.590> that<00:04:41.800> in<00:04:42.610> the<00:04:42.849> future<00:04:42.879> we

00:04:43.379 --> 00:04:43.389 
certainly believe that in the future we

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:45.029 
certainly believe that in the future we
could<00:04:43.509> get<00:04:43.689> even<00:04:43.810> better<00:04:44.080> performance<00:04:44.379> by

00:04:45.029 --> 00:04:45.039 
could get even better performance by

00:04:45.039 --> 00:04:48.209 
could get even better performance by
designing<00:04:45.639> wheels<00:04:46.000> that<00:04:46.449> suit<00:04:46.930> certain<00:04:47.919> tires

00:04:48.209 --> 00:04:48.219 
designing wheels that suit certain tires

00:04:48.219 --> 00:04:50.760 
designing wheels that suit certain tires
but<00:04:49.000> for<00:04:49.210> now<00:04:49.389> we<00:04:49.449> we<00:04:49.990> took<00:04:50.199> that<00:04:50.379> we<00:04:50.530> said

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:50.770 
but for now we we took that we said

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:52.980 
but for now we we took that we said
let's<00:04:51.069> stay<00:04:51.340> with<00:04:51.370> the<00:04:51.610> most<00:04:51.819> common<00:04:52.270> tires

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:52.990 
let's stay with the most common tires

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:55.379 
let's stay with the most common tires
that<00:04:53.259> are<00:04:53.349> being<00:04:53.469> used<00:04:53.800> and<00:04:54.159> that's<00:04:54.759> around<00:04:55.000> it

00:04:55.379 --> 00:04:55.389 
that are being used and that's around it

00:04:55.389 --> 00:04:57.990 
that are being used and that's around it
we<00:04:55.599> designed<00:04:56.259> this<00:04:56.439> for<00:04:56.740> around<00:04:57.009> a<00:04:57.370> twenty<00:04:57.759> two

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:58.000 
we designed this for around a twenty two

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.140 
we designed this for around a twenty two
twenty<00:04:58.419> three<00:04:58.569> millimeter<00:04:59.229> tire<00:05:00.150> presently

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:01.150 
twenty three millimeter tire presently

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:03.149 
twenty three millimeter tire presently
for<00:05:01.810> this<00:05:01.900> year<00:05:02.110> we've<00:05:02.319> started<00:05:02.620> off<00:05:02.860> with<00:05:03.039> the

00:05:03.149 --> 00:05:03.159 
for this year we've started off with the

00:05:03.159 --> 00:05:05.100 
for this year we've started off with the
tubular<00:05:03.550> design<00:05:03.580> and<00:05:04.150> now<00:05:04.810> we're<00:05:04.990> working

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:05.110 
tubular design and now we're working

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:07.680 
tubular design and now we're working
hard<00:05:05.530> on<00:05:05.650> the<00:05:06.340> clean<00:05:06.909> ship<00:05:07.090> design<00:05:07.419> for<00:05:07.629> the

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:07.690 
hard on the clean ship design for the

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:10.350 
hard on the clean ship design for the
future<00:05:08.280> because<00:05:09.280> you've<00:05:09.819> got<00:05:10.030> you're<00:05:10.180> quite

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:10.360 
future because you've got you're quite

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:12.029 
future because you've got you're quite
right<00:05:10.539> that<00:05:10.599> has<00:05:10.960> an<00:05:11.050> important<00:05:11.440> impact<00:05:11.530> on

00:05:12.029 --> 00:05:12.039 
right that has an important impact on

00:05:12.039 --> 00:05:14.730 
right that has an important impact on
the<00:05:12.190> the<00:05:12.729> aerodynamic<00:05:13.210> performance<00:05:13.740> your

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:14.740 
the the aerodynamic performance your

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:16.439 
the the aerodynamic performance your
background<00:05:15.190> is<00:05:15.340> formula<00:05:15.819> one<00:05:16.000> where

00:05:16.439 --> 00:05:16.449 
background is formula one where

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:18.510 
background is formula one where
obviously<00:05:17.139> the<00:05:17.440> speeds<00:05:17.800> are<00:05:18.069> far<00:05:18.250> far<00:05:18.460> higher

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:18.520 
obviously the speeds are far far higher

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:22.679 
obviously the speeds are far far higher
and<00:05:19.680> where<00:05:20.680> the<00:05:20.800> tires<00:05:21.639> are<00:05:22.060> incredibly

00:05:22.679 --> 00:05:22.689 
and where the tires are incredibly

00:05:22.689 --> 00:05:25.860 
and where the tires are incredibly
important<00:05:23.469> on<00:05:23.759> the<00:05:24.759> performance<00:05:25.419> the

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:25.870 
important on the performance the

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:29.790 
important on the performance the
cornering<00:05:26.349> but<00:05:26.800> also<00:05:26.949> the<00:05:27.189> speed<00:05:27.729> of<00:05:28.560> the<00:05:29.560> cars

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:29.800 
cornering but also the speed of the cars

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:33.119 
cornering but also the speed of the cars
so<00:05:30.610> would<00:05:31.599> you<00:05:31.779> recommend<00:05:31.930> any<00:05:32.680> tyre

00:05:33.119 --> 00:05:33.129 
so would you recommend any tyre

00:05:33.129 --> 00:05:34.920 
so would you recommend any tyre
manufacturers<00:05:33.819> in<00:05:33.969> sight<00:05:34.240> would<00:05:34.569> they<00:05:34.750> ever

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:34.930 
manufacturers in sight would they ever

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:39.589 
manufacturers in sight would they ever
need<00:05:35.319> to<00:05:35.889> start<00:05:36.190> designing<00:05:36.430> for<00:05:37.240> aro<00:05:37.449> Oh

00:05:39.589 --> 00:05:39.599 
need to start designing for aro Oh

00:05:39.599 --> 00:05:42.269 
need to start designing for aro Oh
certainly<00:05:40.599> young<00:05:40.930> and<00:05:41.110> we<00:05:41.199> there's<00:05:41.860> two<00:05:42.099> ways

00:05:42.269 --> 00:05:42.279 
certainly young and we there's two ways

00:05:42.279 --> 00:05:45.959 
certainly young and we there's two ways
of<00:05:42.430> looking<00:05:42.490> at<00:05:42.729> it<00:05:42.789> we<00:05:43.169> we<00:05:44.169> try<00:05:44.710> to<00:05:44.770> design<00:05:45.250> in

00:05:45.959 --> 00:05:45.969 
of looking at it we we try to design in

00:05:45.969 --> 00:05:48.570 
of looking at it we we try to design in
a<00:05:46.120> way<00:05:46.270> like<00:05:46.479> we've<00:05:46.990> described<00:05:47.469> which<00:05:47.949> design

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:48.580 
a way like we've described which design

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:50.820 
a way like we've described which design
designing<00:05:49.029> wheel<00:05:49.270> sets<00:05:49.569> the<00:05:49.750> almost<00:05:50.620> less

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:50.830 
designing wheel sets the almost less

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:53.159 
designing wheel sets the almost less
sensitive<00:05:51.279> to<00:05:51.520> different<00:05:51.849> frames<00:05:52.180> so<00:05:53.020> you're

00:05:53.159 --> 00:05:53.169 
sensitive to different frames so you're

00:05:53.169 --> 00:05:55.079 
sensitive to different frames so you're
getting<00:05:53.409> overall<00:05:53.680> better<00:05:53.860> performance<00:05:54.370> we<00:05:54.520> we

00:05:55.079 --> 00:05:55.089 
getting overall better performance we we

00:05:55.089 --> 00:05:56.369 
getting overall better performance we we
have<00:05:55.210> trying<00:05:55.449> to<00:05:55.539> optimize<00:05:55.960> this<00:05:56.139> at<00:05:56.289> the

00:05:56.369 --> 00:05:56.379 
have trying to optimize this at the

00:05:56.379 --> 00:05:59.700 
have trying to optimize this at the
moment<00:05:56.620> generally<00:05:57.339> for<00:05:58.050> various<00:05:59.050> tire<00:05:59.319> shapes

00:05:59.700 --> 00:05:59.710 
moment generally for various tire shapes

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:01.920 
moment generally for various tire shapes
but<00:06:00.400> then<00:06:00.520> you<00:06:00.639> could<00:06:00.879> go<00:06:01.060> the<00:06:01.240> other<00:06:01.270> way<00:06:01.479> and

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:01.930 
but then you could go the other way and

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:04.290 
but then you could go the other way and
take<00:06:02.469> a<00:06:02.500> specific<00:06:03.099> tire<00:06:03.310> shape<00:06:03.610> and<00:06:03.879> optimize

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:04.300 
take a specific tire shape and optimize

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:07.320 
take a specific tire shape and optimize
the<00:06:04.539> rim<00:06:04.719> for<00:06:04.990> that<00:06:05.199> and<00:06:05.409> I<00:06:05.949> think<00:06:06.520> those<00:06:06.819> there

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:07.330 
the rim for that and I think those there

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:08.969 
the rim for that and I think those there
would<00:06:07.419> be<00:06:07.449> some<00:06:07.870> more<00:06:08.020> performance<00:06:08.529> to<00:06:08.650> be<00:06:08.770> had

00:06:08.969 --> 00:06:08.979 
would be some more performance to be had

00:06:08.979 --> 00:06:12.510 
would be some more performance to be had
there<00:06:09.270> but<00:06:10.270> I<00:06:10.300> think<00:06:10.389> it's<00:06:10.690> a<00:06:10.870> kind<00:06:11.770> of<00:06:11.800> a<00:06:11.919> more

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:12.520 
there but I think it's a kind of a more

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:14.249 
there but I think it's a kind of a more
of<00:06:12.550> a<00:06:12.610> second<00:06:13.000> order<00:06:13.180> from<00:06:13.719> where<00:06:14.080> we<00:06:14.229> are

00:06:14.249 --> 00:06:14.259 
of a second order from where we are

00:06:14.259 --> 00:06:16.409 
of a second order from where we are
we've<00:06:14.589> taken<00:06:15.190> this<00:06:15.430> to<00:06:15.580> low<00:06:15.819> line<00:06:16.029> through

00:06:16.409 --> 00:06:16.419 
we've taken this to low line through

00:06:16.419 --> 00:06:18.600 
we've taken this to low line through
first<00:06:16.779> and<00:06:17.110> then<00:06:17.259> you<00:06:17.889> could<00:06:18.069> definitely<00:06:18.219> move

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:18.610 
first and then you could definitely move

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:19.890 
first and then you could definitely move
on<00:06:18.759> in<00:06:18.879> the<00:06:18.940> future<00:06:18.969> and<00:06:19.449> I<00:06:19.509> think<00:06:19.539> you<00:06:19.839> know

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:19.900 
on in the future and I think you know

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:22.110 
on in the future and I think you know
you<00:06:20.050> those<00:06:20.500> things<00:06:20.740> it's<00:06:21.699> diminishing

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:22.120 
you those things it's diminishing

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:24.269 
you those things it's diminishing
returns<00:06:22.569> and<00:06:22.810> as<00:06:22.900> people<00:06:23.080> look<00:06:23.620> for<00:06:23.830> that<00:06:23.979> it's

00:06:24.269 --> 00:06:24.279 
returns and as people look for that it's

00:06:24.279 --> 00:06:26.219 
returns and as people look for that it's
a<00:06:24.460> bit<00:06:24.610> of<00:06:24.699> performance<00:06:25.120> for<00:06:25.509> sure<00:06:25.719> that's

00:06:26.219 --> 00:06:26.229 
a bit of performance for sure that's

00:06:26.229 --> 00:06:28.439 
a bit of performance for sure that's
where<00:06:26.379> we<00:06:26.500> need<00:06:26.830> to<00:06:26.860> be<00:06:27.099> and<00:06:27.639> how<00:06:28.060> much<00:06:28.240> are

00:06:28.439 --> 00:06:28.449 
where we need to be and how much are
