00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.889 

all<00:01:45.250> right<00:01:45.399> now<00:01:45.520> that<00:01:45.700> beats<00:01:45.909> ski<00:01:46.180> racing<00:01:46.600> I

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:51.850 
think we may be able to say we have the

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:53.510 
think we may be able to say we have the
best<00:01:52.030> snow<00:01:52.329> in<00:01:52.450> Europe<00:01:52.689> at<00:01:52.780> the<00:01:52.840> moment<00:01:52.869> it's

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
best snow in Europe at the moment it's

00:01:53.520 --> 00:02:32.440 
best snow in Europe at the moment it's
phenomenal<00:01:54.520> down<00:01:54.700> here

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:35.289 

Here<00:02:33.450> I<00:02:33.569> am<00:02:33.599> sitting<00:02:33.989> at<00:02:34.230> my<00:02:34.409> trusty<00:02:34.860> geisha

00:02:35.289 --> 00:02:35.299 
Here I am sitting at my trusty geisha

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:38.600 
Here I am sitting at my trusty geisha
this<00:02:36.299> morning<00:02:36.720> I<00:02:36.810> looked<00:02:37.140> at<00:02:37.590> the<00:02:37.680> sign<00:02:37.950> and<00:02:38.370> I

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
this morning I looked at the sign and I

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.339 
this morning I looked at the sign and I
debated<00:02:38.760> to<00:02:39.239> take<00:02:39.420> whether<00:02:39.720> students<00:02:40.200> are

00:02:40.339 --> 00:02:40.349 
debated to take whether students are

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:42.679 
debated to take whether students are
whether<00:02:40.680> she<00:02:40.860> took<00:02:40.980> the<00:02:41.099> Geisha<00:02:41.390> so<00:02:42.390> I<00:02:42.420> went

00:02:42.679 --> 00:02:42.689 
whether she took the Geisha so I went

00:02:42.689 --> 00:02:44.270 
whether she took the Geisha so I went
with<00:02:42.750> the<00:02:42.870> trusty<00:02:43.230> geisha<00:02:43.439> and<00:02:43.890> it<00:02:44.189> was

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
with the trusty geisha and it was

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:45.920 
with the trusty geisha and it was
definitely<00:02:44.459> the<00:02:44.760> right<00:02:45.120> choice<00:02:45.180> is<00:02:45.750> there

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
definitely the right choice is there

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.899 
definitely the right choice is there
enough<00:02:46.260> flotation<00:02:46.500> when<00:02:47.099> it<00:02:47.220> gets<00:02:47.370> very<00:02:47.640> deep

00:02:47.899 --> 00:02:47.909 
enough flotation when it gets very deep

00:02:47.909 --> 00:02:50.360 
enough flotation when it gets very deep
and<00:02:48.150> it's<00:02:48.870> also<00:02:49.049> very<00:02:49.230> maneuverable<00:02:50.129> in<00:02:50.250> and

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
and it's also very maneuverable in and

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.520 
and it's also very maneuverable in and
amongst<00:02:50.640> the<00:02:50.700> trees<00:02:50.939> so<00:02:51.239> great<00:02:51.930> choice<00:02:52.230> and<00:02:52.470> I

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
amongst the trees so great choice and I

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.679 
amongst the trees so great choice and I
think<00:02:52.739> it'll<00:02:52.890> probably<00:02:53.099> be<00:02:53.280> my<00:02:53.430> weapon<00:02:54.030> for

00:02:54.679 --> 00:02:54.689 
think it'll probably be my weapon for

00:02:54.689 --> 00:02:56.989 
think it'll probably be my weapon for
this<00:02:54.780> scene
