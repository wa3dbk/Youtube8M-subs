ingredient<00:03:53.519> in<00:03:53.849> the<00:03:53.940> beer<00:03:54.120> to<00:03:54.660> see<00:03:54.840> how<00:03:54.989> it

00:03:55.129 --> 00:03:55.139 
ingredient in the beer to see how it

like if you want some volume and you

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:02.330 
like if you want some volume and you

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
really works in terms of reverting heat

damage<00:04:06.569> on<00:04:06.690> the<00:04:06.750> other<00:04:06.840> hand<00:04:07.049> like<00:04:07.440> that<00:04:07.760> piece

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
damage on the other hand like that piece

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:10.550 
damage on the other hand like that piece
I<00:04:09.060> mean<00:04:09.389> you<00:04:09.510> saw<00:04:09.720> in<00:04:09.959> other<00:04:10.230> videos<00:04:10.530> that

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 
I mean you saw in other videos that

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:13.250 
I mean you saw in other videos that
piece<00:04:10.949> is<00:04:11.160> like<00:04:11.459> beyond<00:04:11.819> repair<00:04:12.180> I<00:04:12.510> don't

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:13.260 
piece is like beyond repair I don't

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.050 
piece is like beyond repair I don't
think<00:04:13.290> anything<00:04:13.799> I<00:04:13.889> can<00:04:14.040> do<00:04:14.129> to<00:04:14.160> it<00:04:14.549> is<00:04:14.699> going

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:15.060 
think anything I can do to it is going

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:17.699 
think anything I can do to it is going
to<00:04:15.269> make<00:04:15.449> it<00:04:15.569> curl<00:04:15.780> again<00:04:16.049> but

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:17.709 
to make it curl again but

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:19.830 
to make it curl again but
my<00:04:18.220> room<00:04:18.459> to<00:04:18.609> do<00:04:18.759> so<00:04:19.030> definitely<00:04:19.539> definitely

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:19.840 
my room to do so definitely definitely

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:21.900 
my room to do so definitely definitely
tighter<00:04:20.259> so<00:04:20.919> I<00:04:20.949> think<00:04:21.069> this<00:04:21.340> is<00:04:21.400> what<00:04:21.579> may<00:04:21.729> be<00:04:21.789> a

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:21.910 
tighter so I think this is what may be a

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:24.570 
tighter so I think this is what may be a
good<00:04:22.270> preventive<00:04:22.870> method<00:04:23.560> I<00:04:23.800> don't<00:04:24.310> think<00:04:24.460> it

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:24.580 
good preventive method I don't think it

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:28.080 
good preventive method I don't think it
necessarily<00:04:24.759> fixes<00:04:25.569> he<00:04:25.810> damaged<00:04:26.229> but<00:04:27.090> before

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:28.090 
necessarily fixes he damaged but before

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:29.850 
necessarily fixes he damaged but before
you<00:04:28.210> get<00:04:28.449> heat<00:04:28.690> damage<00:04:29.080> I<00:04:29.259> would<00:04:29.289> recommend

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:29.860 
you get heat damage I would recommend

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:34.170 
you get heat damage I would recommend
