that second half you know I thought for

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.200 
that second half you know I thought for
us<00:01:49.770> you<00:01:49.950> know<00:01:49.979> when<00:01:50.189> we<00:01:50.280> score<00:01:50.520> them<00:01:50.729> than<00:01:51.060> two

us you know when we score them than two

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.210 
us you know when we score them than two
tries<00:01:51.540> then<00:01:51.840> we<00:01:51.930> went<00:01:52.079> nearly<00:01:52.560> went<00:01:52.740> up<00:01:53.100> the

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
tries then we went nearly went up the

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.340 
tries then we went nearly went up the
field<00:01:53.430> again<00:01:53.700> and<00:01:53.880> scored<00:01:54.149> and<00:01:54.329> then<00:01:54.509> we<00:01:55.200> gave

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
field again and scored and then we gave

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:56.569 
field again and scored and then we gave
away<00:01:55.380> apparently<00:01:55.710> they<00:01:55.979> kick<00:01:56.159> to<00:01:56.250> the<00:01:56.340> corn

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
away apparently they kick to the corn

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:57.970 
away apparently they kick to the corn
and<00:01:56.759> I<00:01:56.820> drove<00:01:57.000> us<00:01:57.149> over

00:01:57.970 --> 00:01:57.980 
and I drove us over

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:59.290 
and I drove us over
just<00:01:58.100> kind<00:01:58.280> of<00:01:58.340> deflated<00:01:58.550> us<00:01:58.880> a<00:01:58.970> little<00:01:59.090> bit

00:01:59.290 --> 00:01:59.300 
just kind of deflated us a little bit

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:01.060 
just kind of deflated us a little bit
