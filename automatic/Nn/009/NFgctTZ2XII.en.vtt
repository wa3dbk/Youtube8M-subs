00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
once it's coded using a fork we're just

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.260 
once it's coded using a fork we're just
going<00:01:24.960> to<00:01:24.990> pick<00:01:25.140> it<00:01:25.229> up<00:01:25.729> let<00:01:26.729> it<00:01:26.820> drain<00:01:27.060> for<00:01:27.210> a

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
going to pick it up let it drain for a

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:28.910 
going to pick it up let it drain for a
bit<00:01:27.420> then<00:01:28.080> we're<00:01:28.200> going<00:01:28.320> to<00:01:28.380> place<00:01:28.530> it<00:01:28.680> onto<00:01:28.799> a

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
bit then we're going to place it onto a

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.620 
bit then we're going to place it onto a
plate

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.469

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
next into a pot of hot oil that is at

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.640 
next into a pot of hot oil that is at
say<00:01:37.259> 100<00:01:37.439> ninety<00:01:37.890> degrees<00:01:38.130> Celsius<00:01:38.610> or<00:01:39.650> 370

say 100 ninety degrees Celsius or 370

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.920 
say 100 ninety degrees Celsius or 370
degrees<00:01:40.920> Fahrenheit<00:01:41.729> now<00:01:42.659> we're<00:01:42.780> going<00:01:42.869> to

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
degrees Fahrenheit now we're going to

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:56.750 
degrees Fahrenheit now we're going to
