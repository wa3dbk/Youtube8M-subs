out how to keep their hardware devices
up-to-date<00:00:19.770> and<00:00:20.390> the<00:00:21.390> problem<00:00:22.140> is<00:00:22.289> that<00:00:22.710> new

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
up-to-date and the problem is that new

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.249 
up-to-date and the problem is that new
drivers<00:00:23.460> are<00:00:23.669> released<00:00:24.119> constantly<00:00:24.750> it<00:00:25.110> can

00:00:25.249 --> 00:00:25.259 
drivers are released constantly it can

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:26.749 
drivers are released constantly it can
be<00:00:25.320> really<00:00:25.619> hard<00:00:25.800> to<00:00:25.860> stay<00:00:26.099> on<00:00:26.219> top<00:00:26.460> of<00:00:26.489> each

00:00:26.749 --> 00:00:26.759

new release you know there's lots of
reasons<00:00:29.910> why<00:00:30.000> drivers<00:00:30.689> are<00:00:31.160> continually

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
reasons why drivers are continually

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
software and hardware are up-to-date and

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.919 
software and hardware are up-to-date and
have<00:00:52.379> the<00:00:52.469> latest<00:00:52.620> drivers<00:00:53.179> and<00:00:54.179> you<00:00:54.809> know

have the latest drivers and you know

00:00:54.929 --> 00:00:56.660 
have the latest drivers and you know
other<00:00:55.079> times<00:00:55.379> devices<00:00:55.890> just<00:00:56.129> don't<00:00:56.370> work

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
other times devices just don't work

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:57.739 
other times devices just don't work
correctly

00:00:57.739 --> 00:00:57.749 
correctly

00:00:57.749 --> 00:00:59.750 
correctly
you<00:00:58.559> know<00:00:58.679> whether<00:00:58.829> a<00:00:58.949> certain<00:00:59.460> device

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
you know whether a certain device

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.579 
you know whether a certain device
doesn't<00:01:00.179> have<00:01:00.269> sound<00:01:00.510> or<00:01:00.929> printers<00:01:01.350> and

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:01.589 
doesn't have sound or printers and

00:01:01.589 --> 00:01:04.729 
doesn't have sound or printers and
working<00:01:01.979> USB<00:01:02.489> not<00:01:02.729> functioning<00:01:03.739> typically

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
working USB not functioning typically

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.050 
working USB not functioning typically
the<00:01:04.860> answer<00:01:05.159> is<00:01:05.250> because<00:01:05.550> they<00:01:05.760> don't<00:01:05.970> have

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
the answer is because they don't have

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.080 
the answer is because they don't have
up-to-date<00:01:06.390> drivers<00:01:07.110> and<00:01:07.799> you<00:01:08.640> know<00:01:08.760> finding

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
up-to-date drivers and you know finding

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.670 
up-to-date drivers and you know finding
these<00:01:09.210> own<00:01:09.450> on<00:01:09.720> your<00:01:09.900> own<00:01:10.049> is<00:01:10.290> a<00:01:10.320> really

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
these own on your own is a really

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.610 
these own on your own is a really
difficult<00:01:11.190> task<00:01:11.810> this<00:01:12.810> is<00:01:12.870> even<00:01:13.200> worse<00:01:13.320> for

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:13.620 
difficult task this is even worse for

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:15.830 
difficult task this is even worse for
people<00:01:13.920> who<00:01:14.070> might<00:01:14.820> have<00:01:14.850> just<00:01:15.060> reformatted

people who might have just reformatted

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.380 
people who might have just reformatted
their<00:01:15.960> system<00:01:16.410> and<00:01:16.710> lost<00:01:17.490> all<00:01:17.790> their<00:01:17.910> drivers

don't you know the device will not only

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.700 
don't you know the device will not only
work<00:01:29.430> it<00:01:29.730> can<00:01:29.880> cause<00:01:30.090> crashing<00:01:30.930> freezing<00:01:31.470> blue

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710

for folks who are lazy like me and want

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.050 
for folks who are lazy like me and want
a<00:01:37.680> simple<00:01:38.010> solution<00:01:38.250> there<00:01:38.670> is<00:01:38.700> what<00:01:38.970> is

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
a simple solution there is what is

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.300 
a simple solution there is what is
called<00:01:39.330> driver<00:01:39.750> update<00:01:40.290> software

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
called driver update software

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.520 
called driver update software
it<00:01:41.700> basically<00:01:42.270> performs<00:01:42.960> a<00:01:43.020> full<00:01:43.230> scan<00:01:43.470> of

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
it basically performs a full scan of

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.580 
it basically performs a full scan of
your<00:01:43.710> machine<00:01:44.070> and<00:01:44.720> updates<00:01:45.720> your<00:01:45.900> drivers

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
your machine and updates your drivers

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.470 
your machine and updates your drivers
with<00:01:46.950> a<00:01:46.980> click<00:01:47.460> of<00:01:47.490> the<00:01:47.640> mouse<00:01:47.670> the<00:01:48.330> whole

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:48.480 
with a click of the mouse the whole

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:52.480 
with a click of the mouse the whole
process<00:01:48.720> will<00:01:49.080> just<00:01:49.290> take<00:01:49.530> a<00:01:49.770> couple<00:01:49.800> minutes

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:55.639 

so<00:01:53.490> what<00:01:53.729> we'll<00:01:53.850> do<00:01:53.969> here<00:01:54.210> is<00:01:54.270> go<00:01:54.869> to<00:01:54.930> the

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
so what we'll do here is go to the

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:21.979 
so what we'll do here is go to the
website<00:02:06.200> www.jfn.co.jp/toho<00:02:20.840> just<00:02:21.840> gonna

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:21.989 
website www.jfn.co.jp/toho just gonna
