00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:01.620 
which is then connected to our stick

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:05.819 
which is then connected to our stick
that<00:04:02.620> is<00:04:02.950> stick<00:04:03.670> stacking<00:04:04.500> now<00:04:05.500> for<00:04:05.739> this

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:05.829 
that is stick stacking now for this

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:09.420 
that is stick stacking now for this
video<00:04:06.130> I<00:04:06.459> just<00:04:06.820> used<00:04:07.150> one<00:04:08.049> stick<00:04:08.290> you<00:04:09.100> can<00:04:09.280> use
