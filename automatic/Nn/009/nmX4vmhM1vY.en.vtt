00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 Hello again, my dear 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:06.690
 subscribers today we will have a review here 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:08.849
 such a strange parcel from Thailand 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.010
 and I honestly don't know yet 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.950
 is in this package she is all 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.910
 some kind of rumpled tape rewound 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:19.460
 Russian post 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.460
 Well, in general, let's go open 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.070
 in general, the guys here are such 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.680
 a strange premise as I already said she 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.090
 all wrinkled and scrambled mail 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:37.590
 Russia is so pretty 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:39.620
 here I am 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.989
 once I get a package with such a hat 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:45.420
 here some guys act on the outside 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:48.870
 condition and external condition 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:51.120
 shipments and weight difference in general I 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:57.350
 I do not know what kind of act, let's open from 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:57.350
 me here branded legs and so 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:10.010
 let's open let's see what kind of act 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:13.950
 such as I understood either at customs 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:16.770
 packaging wounded or mail Russia 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:19.920
 I wanted to report from me to steal from the parcel 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:22.950
 but I understand that there are three of you there 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:25.380
 no iPhones and packed the whole thing 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:30.270
 back so we act that here 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:32.250
 it is written so guys I do not understand 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.259
 to be honest, what is it like that with 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:39.210
 external examination turned shell 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:42.179
 damaged so apply il weight 208 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:47.070
 4 actually 284 but everything seems fine 

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:53.759
 with a weight so make up 2 copies 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:55.219
 blah blah blah section chief there but I 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:57.600
 I did not understand what it is 

00:01:55.219 --> 00:02:00.840
 in general, okay, let's open our 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:03.659
 the package I guess it should 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:06.109
 be some kind of vermicelli guys quick 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.109
 preparations 

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:13.830
 although maybe I 'm wrong 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:15.450
 I just ordered a lot and no longer 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:27.690
 remember so let's actually now 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:35.850

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:39.990

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:44.340

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:47.280
 deal with finances buy yourself guys 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:56.880
 good yard to open parcels 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:58.620
 worthy so here we have so i'm really 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:02.130
 I thought that we had some kind of 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:02.790
 perry michelle will and has already prepared 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:06.120
 boiling water 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:08.640
 we have guys here are not vermicelli but here 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:12.030

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:17.940

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:19.280

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:23.450

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:26.930
 at a pace I will soon stomach myself 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:26.930
 put in the end 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:40.590
 so mean here we guys mean 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:41.010
 weight 110 grams and these chips cost 460 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:44.209
 rubles 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:49.590
 the link will be as always in the description so 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:53.489
 everything is written incomprehensible in general such here 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:55.670
 hot in and spice type chips 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:59.400
 some kind of super sharp at all 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:04:03.470
 type there peppers should be dofiga such 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:05.959
 Here is the steam room chip Sayan whiskered face 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:12.180
 let's actually open our chips 

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:15.079
 from Thailand and tastes at all 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:18.389
 strange fact that what the packaging was 

00:04:15.079 --> 00:04:20.329
 damaged because it seems to me that 

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:23.849
 the seller then sent everything ok 

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:25.949
 just at customs or where else are they 

00:04:23.849 --> 00:04:29.550
 probably thought it might be there 

00:04:25.949 --> 00:04:34.949
 it is valuable and wanted to steal but 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:39.150
 We looked at you and packed 

00:04:34.949 --> 00:04:42.510
 back so tonic any guys all 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:46.139
 damn to get chips don't know 

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:49.740
 Generally give something two put water 

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:52.860
 do not lie here are such chips as we 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:54.630
 see here a lot of spices on them I 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:58.500
 how many pringles ate chips yet 

00:04:54.630 --> 00:05:01.919
 noticed so many 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:04.800
 there were spices in general let's try 

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:09.659
 Our chips pringles want to save which 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:11.490
 They in the country are sharp drove at all if 

00:05:09.659 --> 00:05:12.539
 honestly the chips are not very straight i would say 

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:16.010
 what's super sharp 

00:05:12.539 --> 00:05:20.340
 but asters feeling like 

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:24.090
 barbecue mixed with hot pepper that is 

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:25.770
 taste like this barbecue and pepper but 

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:29.159
 nothing is right here for the barbecue 

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:33.509
 it's just that the peppers are flying and in general 

00:05:29.159 --> 00:05:37.610
 such things are like a chip 

00:05:33.509 --> 00:05:41.150
 delicious I'll give them perhaps points 10 out of 10 

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:44.150
 but they do not match what's hot 

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:46.129
 young and spa city by super-sharp well yes 

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:49.969
 not sharp but not right that super straight 

00:05:46.129 --> 00:05:53.110
 super at all here are the things you have here 

00:05:49.969 --> 00:05:56.389
 There was such a package from Thailand 

00:05:53.110 --> 00:06:00.580

00:05:56.389 --> 00:06:00.580
