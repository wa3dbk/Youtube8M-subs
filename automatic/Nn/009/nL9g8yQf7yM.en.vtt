00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
180 with your head and shoulders and the

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.620 
180 with your head and shoulders and the
board<00:01:53.040> just<00:01:53.220> goes<00:01:53.430> flying<00:01:53.850> out<00:01:54.119> in<00:01:54.270> front<00:01:54.509> of

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
board just goes flying out in front of

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.230 
board just goes flying out in front of
you<00:01:54.780> and<00:01:55.020> there's<00:01:55.740> just<00:01:55.890> really<00:01:56.130> no<00:01:56.310> control

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
you and there's just really no control

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.840 
you and there's just really no control
now<00:01:58.170> if<00:01:58.350> you<00:01:58.469> have<00:01:58.680> a<00:01:58.710> good<00:01:59.009> ollie<00:01:59.340> and<00:01:59.700> you're

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
now if you have a good ollie and you're

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.090 
now if you have a good ollie and you're
able<00:01:59.939> to<00:02:00.210> pop<00:02:00.450> an<00:02:00.689> ollie<00:02:00.810> up<00:02:01.020> into<00:02:01.380> the<00:02:01.500> air<00:02:01.530> a

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
able to pop an ollie up into the air a

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.120 
able to pop an ollie up into the air a
good<00:02:02.430> like<00:02:02.640> let's<00:02:03.149> let's<00:02:04.100> guesstimate<00:02:05.100> a

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
good like let's let's guesstimate a

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.999 
good like let's let's guesstimate a
number<00:02:06.060> here<00:02:06.299> of<00:02:06.450> like<00:02:06.630> six<00:02:07.049> inches<00:02:07.259> let's<00:02:07.770> say

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
number here of like six inches let's say

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.790 
number here of like six inches let's say
if<00:02:08.610> you're<00:02:08.849> able<00:02:08.970> to<00:02:09.300> level<00:02:09.959> out<00:02:10.229> your<00:02:10.500> board

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
if you're able to level out your board

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.430 
if you're able to level out your board
in<00:02:11.039> the<00:02:11.280> air<00:02:11.459> six<00:02:11.940> inches<00:02:12.330> up<00:02:12.540> there

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
in the air six inches up there

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.830 
in the air six inches up there
then<00:02:13.620> you<00:02:14.070> have<00:02:14.310> enough<00:02:14.760> hang<00:02:15.150> time<00:02:15.180> you<00:02:15.630> have

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
then you have enough hang time you have

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.770 
then you have enough hang time you have
enough<00:02:16.140> air<00:02:16.350> in<00:02:16.860> order<00:02:17.790> to<00:02:18.000> turn<00:02:18.300> your<00:02:18.600> upper

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
enough air in order to turn your upper

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.860 
enough air in order to turn your upper
body<00:02:19.170> and<00:02:19.560> then<00:02:20.370> have<00:02:20.730> your<00:02:20.940> legs<00:02:21.240> do<00:02:21.600> that

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
body and then have your legs do that

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.960 
body and then have your legs do that
motion<00:02:22.410> underneath<00:02:22.890> you<00:02:23.130> in<00:02:23.310> order<00:02:23.550> to<00:02:23.700> get

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
motion underneath you in order to get

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.680 
motion underneath you in order to get
the<00:02:24.150> 180<00:02:24.540> so<00:02:25.170> really<00:02:25.530> this<00:02:25.710> is<00:02:25.890> more<00:02:26.130> of<00:02:26.160> a

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
the 180 so really this is more of a

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:29.660 
the 180 so really this is more of a
handling<00:02:27.690> of<00:02:27.900> just<00:02:28.350> get<00:02:29.100> your<00:02:29.220> Ollie's<00:02:29.640> down

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
handling of just get your Ollie's down

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.730 
handling of just get your Ollie's down
it's<00:02:30.060> very<00:02:30.270> very<00:02:30.570> very<00:02:30.810> very<00:02:31.080> very<00:02:31.230> very<00:02:31.620> very

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:31.740 
it's very very very very very very very

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:34.460 
it's very very very very very very very
very<00:02:32.130> very<00:02:32.280> very<00:02:32.640> very<00:02:32.790> very<00:02:33.180> important<00:02:33.720> and<00:02:34.020> I

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
very very very very very important and I

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.500 
very very very very very important and I
know<00:02:34.530> there's<00:02:34.800> going<00:02:34.950> to<00:02:35.040> be<00:02:35.100> a<00:02:35.460> couple<00:02:36.150> people

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
know there's going to be a couple people

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.000 
know there's going to be a couple people
who<00:02:36.540> are<00:02:36.780> like<00:02:36.960> I<00:02:37.170> learned<00:02:37.410> how<00:02:37.620> to<00:02:37.680> frontside

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
who are like I learned how to frontside

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.190 
who are like I learned how to frontside
180<00:02:38.370> before<00:02:38.790> I<00:02:38.820> even<00:02:38.970> knew<00:02:39.120> how<00:02:39.330> to<00:02:39.390> ollie<00:02:39.630> or

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
180 before I even knew how to ollie or

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.100 
180 before I even knew how to ollie or
some<00:02:40.410> wild<00:02:40.710> thing<00:02:40.920> like<00:02:41.070> that<00:02:41.100> but<00:02:42.000> the<00:02:42.750> ollie

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
some wild thing like that but the ollie

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:46.760 
some wild thing like that but the ollie
is<00:02:43.590> actually<00:02:44.010> part<00:02:44.370> of<00:02:44.670> the<00:02:44.730> 180<00:02:45.330> so<00:02:46.110> even<00:02:46.650> if

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770 
is actually part of the 180 so even if

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:50.120 
is actually part of the 180 so even if
you<00:02:46.950> were<00:02:47.280> to<00:02:47.850> actually<00:02:48.330> be<00:02:49.110> able<00:02:49.290> to<00:02:49.470> do<00:02:49.710> a<00:02:49.740> 180

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
you were to actually be able to do a 180

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:52.430 
you were to actually be able to do a 180
but<00:02:50.460> you<00:02:50.550> skipped<00:02:50.790> it<00:02:51.000> ollie<00:02:51.180> you're<00:02:51.930> missing

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
but you skipped it ollie you're missing

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.490 
but you skipped it ollie you're missing
so<00:02:53.100> much<00:02:53.730> and<00:02:54.150> later<00:02:54.900> on<00:02:55.140> in<00:02:55.320> your

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
so much and later on in your

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.200 
so much and later on in your
skateboarding<00:02:56.100> that's<00:02:56.280> just<00:02:56.520> going<00:02:56.640> to<00:02:56.730> catch

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:57.210 
skateboarding that's just going to catch

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:58.550 
skateboarding that's just going to catch
up<00:02:57.420> with<00:02:57.570> you<00:02:57.750> and<00:02:57.960> then<00:02:58.080> it's<00:02:58.200> going<00:02:58.350> to<00:02:58.410> be

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
up with you and then it's going to be

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.370 
up with you and then it's going to be
really<00:02:58.770> hard<00:02:59.190> so<00:02:59.820> definitely<00:03:00.270> go<00:03:00.690> back<00:03:00.870> and

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380 
really hard so definitely go back and

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:04.280 
really hard so definitely go back and
just<00:03:01.530> master<00:03:02.100> the<00:03:02.250> ollie<00:03:02.490> that<00:03:03.480> is<00:03:03.660> the<00:03:04.050> most

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
just master the ollie that is the most

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.710 
just master the ollie that is the most
important<00:03:04.830> thing<00:03:05.070> it's<00:03:05.250> actually<00:03:05.720> probably

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
important thing it's actually probably

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.630 
important thing it's actually probably
the<00:03:07.200> most<00:03:07.440> important<00:03:08.100> trick<00:03:08.430> in

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
the most important trick in

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.310 
the most important trick in
skateboarding<00:03:09.450> is<00:03:09.600> just<00:03:09.810> getting<00:03:10.020> a<00:03:10.140> really

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:10.320 
skateboarding is just getting a really

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:12.860 
skateboarding is just getting a really
good<00:03:10.440> ollie<00:03:10.860> down<00:03:11.190> because<00:03:11.700> look<00:03:12.000> at<00:03:12.150> how<00:03:12.810> many

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
good ollie down because look at how many

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.440 
good ollie down because look at how many
other<00:03:13.260> tricks<00:03:13.710> depend<00:03:14.220> upon<00:03:14.550> it<00:03:14.580> it's<00:03:15.240> pretty

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
other tricks depend upon it it's pretty

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:16.970 
other tricks depend upon it it's pretty
much<00:03:15.630> anything<00:03:16.020> you're<00:03:16.320> going<00:03:16.500> to<00:03:16.560> do<00:03:16.770> on<00:03:16.950> a

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
much anything you're going to do on a

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.970 
much anything you're going to do on a
skateboard<00:03:17.340> is<00:03:17.850> going<00:03:18.209> to<00:03:18.450> require<00:03:19.290> that<00:03:19.560> you

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
skateboard is going to require that you

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.340 
skateboard is going to require that you
are<00:03:20.400> able<00:03:20.670> to<00:03:20.940> pop<00:03:21.180> your<00:03:21.360> board<00:03:21.570> up<00:03:21.930> into<00:03:22.230> the

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 
are able to pop your board up into the

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:25.270 
are able to pop your board up into the
air<00:03:22.380> and<00:03:22.890> have<00:03:23.280> a<00:03:23.310> pretty<00:03:23.790> decent<00:03:24.239> ollie<00:03:24.510> and

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.280 
air and have a pretty decent ollie and

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:29.210 
air and have a pretty decent ollie and
yes<00:03:26.280> the<00:03:27.209> frontside<00:03:27.600> 180<00:03:27.870> is<00:03:28.080> the<00:03:28.350> second<00:03:28.860> step

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
yes the frontside 180 is the second step

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:32.090 
yes the frontside 180 is the second step
in<00:03:29.430> the<00:03:29.580> series<00:03:29.940> so<00:03:30.209> it<00:03:30.360> is<00:03:30.480> the<00:03:30.690> next<00:03:31.140> one<00:03:31.410> but

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:32.100 
in the series so it is the next one but

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:33.500 
in the series so it is the next one but
you<00:03:32.220> just<00:03:32.400> have<00:03:32.550> to<00:03:32.670> get<00:03:32.820> that<00:03:32.970> ollie<00:03:33.239> down

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
you just have to get that ollie down

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:36.170 
you just have to get that ollie down
better<00:03:33.840> notice<00:03:34.709> this<00:03:34.830> right<00:03:35.100> here<00:03:35.340> he<00:03:35.459> pops<00:03:35.880> up

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
better notice this right here he pops up

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:39.020 
better notice this right here he pops up
drags<00:03:36.750> his<00:03:36.959> front<00:03:37.200> foot<00:03:37.410> he's<00:03:37.709> like<00:03:37.739> fully<00:03:38.700> all
