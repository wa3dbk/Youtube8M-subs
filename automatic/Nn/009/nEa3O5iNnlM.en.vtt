00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:12.350 
anything what I do is I just take the

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:16.480 
anything what I do is I just take the
plate<00:01:13.480> mainly<00:01:14.480> just<00:01:15.140> for<00:01:15.380> cleanliness<00:01:15.620> and<00:01:16.190> a

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:16.490 
plate mainly just for cleanliness and a

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:19.000 
plate mainly just for cleanliness and a
little<00:01:17.030> bit<00:01:17.120> of<00:01:17.180> insulation<00:01:17.740> when<00:01:18.740> I<00:01:18.770> touch

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:19.010 
little bit of insulation when I touch

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:22.060 
little bit of insulation when I touch
here<00:01:19.280> fairly<00:01:20.260> fairly<00:01:21.260> warm<00:01:21.560> but<00:01:21.770> I<00:01:21.800> mean<00:01:21.979> I

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:22.070 
here fairly fairly warm but I mean I

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:25.300 
here fairly fairly warm but I mean I
could<00:01:22.130> keep<00:01:22.340> my<00:01:22.490> hand<00:01:22.700> here<00:01:22.940> all<00:01:23.660> day<00:01:24.190> it<00:01:25.190> would

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:25.310 
could keep my hand here all day it would

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.450 
could keep my hand here all day it would
be<00:01:25.430> fine<00:01:26.710> the<00:01:27.710> plate<00:01:27.920> it's<00:01:28.100> a<00:01:28.190> little<00:01:28.370> bit

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:28.460 
be fine the plate it's a little bit

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:30.640 
be fine the plate it's a little bit
cooler<00:01:28.790> but<00:01:29.150> I<00:01:29.210> think<00:01:29.450> what<00:01:29.600> really<00:01:29.750> does<00:01:30.620> the

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:30.650 
cooler but I think what really does the

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:34.420 
cooler but I think what really does the
trick<00:01:30.800> is<00:01:31.280> the<00:01:31.430> hot<00:01:31.610> air<00:01:31.640> around<00:01:31.940> here<00:01:32.500> oh<00:01:33.500> yeah

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:34.430 
trick is the hot air around here oh yeah

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:37.359 
trick is the hot air around here oh yeah
I<00:01:34.460> just<00:01:34.580> stacked<00:01:35.180> my<00:01:36.070> different<00:01:37.070> types<00:01:37.220> of

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:37.369 
I just stacked my different types of

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:37.770 
I just stacked my different types of
peppers

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:37.780 
peppers

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:40.420 
peppers
sometimes<00:01:38.780> I<00:01:38.960> even<00:01:39.500> start<00:01:39.890> other<00:01:40.070> types<00:01:40.340> of

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:40.430 
sometimes I even start other types of

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:43.359 
sometimes I even start other types of
seeds<00:01:40.670> here<00:01:40.840> find<00:01:41.840> on<00:01:41.990> it<00:01:42.170> dense<00:01:42.350> it<00:01:43.009> does<00:01:43.160> work

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:43.369 
seeds here find on it dense it does work

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:48.310

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:58.220 
very warm so you're not just getting the

00:01:58.220 --> 00:01:59.650 
very warm so you're not just getting the
heat<00:01:58.430> from<00:01:58.610> underneath<00:01:58.850> you're<00:01:59.210> getting<00:01:59.420> heat

00:01:59.650 --> 00:01:59.660 
heat from underneath you're getting heat

pepper<00:02:32.990> sauce<00:02:33.260> here<00:02:33.500> I<00:02:35.470> started<00:02:36.470> these<00:02:38.470> 10

root there I thought it would have had a
little<00:02:57.489> bit<00:02:57.610> more

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:04.050

and now my yellow pepper it looks like

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.990 
and now my yellow pepper it looks like
that<00:03:12.040> of<00:03:12.190> six<00:03:12.540> that<00:03:13.540> maybe<00:03:13.840> four<00:03:14.610> donated<00:03:15.610> you

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 
that of six that maybe four donated you

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.130

another stage I think what's these first

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:31.390 
another stage I think what's these first
set<00:06:27.080> of<00:06:27.460> plants<00:06:28.460> mature<00:06:28.850> I'll<00:06:29.650> move<00:06:30.650> them<00:06:30.890> to<00:06:31.370> a

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:31.400 
set of plants mature I'll move them to a

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:35.290 
set of plants mature I'll move them to a
different<00:06:31.460> level<00:06:31.820> and<00:06:33.040> you<00:06:34.040> know<00:06:34.190> for<00:06:34.729> for

different level and you know for for

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:37.180 
different level and you know for for
taller<00:06:35.510> plants<00:06:35.930> and<00:06:36.140> then<00:06:36.440> I'll<00:06:36.590> just<00:06:36.800> start

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:37.190 
taller plants and then I'll just start

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:39.399 
taller plants and then I'll just start
my<00:06:37.790> little<00:06:38.060> tiny<00:06:38.330> seedlings<00:06:38.840> like

let me see how this goes
this<00:07:14.899> should<00:07:15.079> be<00:07:15.199> fine<00:07:15.409> for<00:07:15.849> at<00:07:16.849> least<00:07:16.969> four

00:07:17.229 --> 00:07:17.239 
this should be fine for at least four

this should be fine for at least four
what<00:07:17.360> I'm<00:07:17.449> doing<00:07:17.629> in<00:07:17.779> the<00:07:18.349> short<00:07:18.800> term<00:07:18.949> so
