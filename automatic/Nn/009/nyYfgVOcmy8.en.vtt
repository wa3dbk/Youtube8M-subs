 hello my name is alfonsina and I would like 

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:14.880
 help you set up wifi calls or 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:17.250
 wifi with link on your windows phone 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:20.400
 we fight calling allows you to do 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:23.810
 calls and send texts through a 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:26.520
 Wifi network even when you have no signal 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:29.939
 like in the basement of your house or in the 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:33.030
 office the first step is to verify that 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.530
 your phone is connected to a network 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.079
 Wifi 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.030
 look at the bar above to see if 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:42.090
 you have the wifi symbol 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.840
 if so, you're ready to start 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:48.720
 otherwise go to the menu 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:51.060
 configurations to activate wifi is 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:53.700
 You may have to enter a 

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:56.610
 password if the wifi network has 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:59.760
 security now that we know we're 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:02.180
 connected we will configure wifi 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:05.000
 calling 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:08.090
 we fight calling should be activated 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.020
 automatically when you start using your 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:13.409
 phone 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:16.530
 however to verify it simply 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:19.920
 move to the left again and 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:22.590
 then down to see wifi calls 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:26.030
 in the list of applications select 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:29.039
 wifi calling in the application list 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:32.640
 use the indicator to activate or 

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:36.240
 disable this function now you're 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:39.360
 ready to use wifi calling I have a 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.840
 more suggestion for you 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:45.900
 anchor tiles to the home screen 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:48.570
 saves time I recommend anchoring the 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:52.320
 wifi mosaic calling to your screen 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:55.530
 home to be easily accessed if 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:58.290
 you need to make some change or consult 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:01.680
 the help menu list 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:04.110
 applications keep pressed wifi 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.659
 calling until the menu appears 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:12.080
 options to anchor 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:15.660
 select anchor at the start or team start 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:18.480
 this will place the wifi calling mosaic 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:21.390
 on the homepage later you will be able to 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:23.549
 make it smaller or bigger and 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.510
 move it anywhere within your 

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:28.080
