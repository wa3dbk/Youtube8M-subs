builder<00:00:16.440> the<00:00:16.529> reason<00:00:16.890> it's<00:00:17.279> like<00:00:17.520> that<00:00:17.670> is

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
builder the reason it's like that is

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:19.279 
builder the reason it's like that is
because<00:00:18.090> these<00:00:18.330> players<00:00:18.660> are<00:00:18.900> quite<00:00:19.080> high

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
because these players are quite high

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.019 
because these players are quite high
rated<00:00:19.740> and<00:00:19.949> they're<00:00:20.279> dropped<00:00:20.609> a<00:00:20.760> hell<00:00:20.880> of<00:00:20.910> a

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
rated and they're dropped a hell of a

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:22.970 
rated and they're dropped a hell of a
lot<00:00:21.180> by<00:00:21.630> the<00:00:21.750> time<00:00:21.960> I<00:00:21.990> built<00:00:22.380> this<00:00:22.500> one<00:00:22.560> I<00:00:22.830> do

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
lot by the time I built this one I do

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.859 
lot by the time I built this one I do
build<00:00:23.250> my<00:00:23.369> squads<00:00:23.609> quite<00:00:23.850> far<00:00:24.150> in<00:00:24.269> advance<00:00:24.390> but

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
build my squads quite far in advance but

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:26.359 
build my squads quite far in advance but

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
and don't actually play over them until

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:27.950 
and don't actually play over them until
