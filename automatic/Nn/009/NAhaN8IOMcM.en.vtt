00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
 when you are considering high 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.450
 cost of updates decorative 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:07.950
 profiles are an easy way to create 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.410
 classic design without major 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.150
 financial costs adding 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.500
 decorative profiles and rounding 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.599
 along with the ceiling coverings 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.000
 paintings or wall slats 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:22.109
 can transform a nondescript room into 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.289
 much more luxurious decorative 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.949
 profiles are made of solid wood 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:28.050
 fibreboard in the middle 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.630
 density or pine thorn planks 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.309
 connections these strips are white pines with 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.079
 blanks that will be held together 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.520
 spiked 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:37.590
 they are fresh from the drying oven 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.420
 hygrometer measures the humidity of each 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:48.059
 the bar determines not dried enough 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:50.520
 wood for further processing 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.829
 guides better laser sizing 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.539
 and each particular piece of laser 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.699
 sends this information to the computer 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.210
 who sends the slats down the pipeline 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.399
 farther 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.750
 where they will be about the strings to the required 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:04.969
 thickness and put in order 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.969
 This process turns the bar into a blog. 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.710
 now blocks are coming 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.630
 high-tech device which 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.939
 identifies defects and needs to be eliminated 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.220
 each block is passed through this 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:22.430
 device where the scanner captures all of it 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.430
 specifications 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:29.420
 further information is transmitted to the computer 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.420
 which calculates the processing plan 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.609
 Bella running computer 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:55.729
 cuts off all the knots and pieces of wood 

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:59.350
 poor quality mechanical pushers 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:59.350
 drop trim from conveyor 

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:15.380
 in the meantime the blocks keep moving 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:19.630
 getting under razor sharp rotating 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:19.630
 heads that cut spikes on the ends 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:31.120
 in the next stage the spikes are covered 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:31.120
 industrial strength wood glue 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:39.620
 now the conveyor picks up speed and 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:43.120
 squeezes blocks under high pressure spikes 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:43.120
 fit tightly into each other 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:03:01.099
 when glue dries compound 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:03:03.250
 connected blocks become strong 

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:05.269
 represent a continuous stream 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:08.170
 now the saw cuts them into pieces 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:08.170
 standard size 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:14.599
 these narrow are called blanks 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:22.970
 because they have not yet been given the right 

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:24.739
 the shape now blanks are sawn into 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:26.629
 longitudinal direction to thickness 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:28.810
 specific profile for which they 

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:28.810
 intended 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:45.580
 The final step of giving the workpiece 

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:48.140
 desired profile 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:50.480
 machine which is called molding 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:53.080
 machine has revolving steel knives 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:55.490
 which give the tree the required shape 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:04:07.070
 for each profile there are 

00:03:55.490 --> 00:04:08.750
 special knives molding machine 

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:12.700
 turns the blanks into decorative 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:12.700
 profiles at 30 meters per minute 

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:34.270
 profiles made from pine 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:36.610
 or fibreboard least 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:38.740
 expensive to purchase but they can not 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:41.320
 paint like a solid profile 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:43.590
 wood otherwise way DIY can all 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:43.590
 to spoil
