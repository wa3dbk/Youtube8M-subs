okay this is our rollout nesting box my
husband<00:00:05.339> already<00:00:05.640> posted<00:00:06.180> a<00:00:06.359> video<00:00:06.779> of<00:00:07.230> this

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
first of all there is a 2x4 which he cut

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:30.679 
first of all there is a 2x4 which he cut
a<00:00:25.320> 45<00:00:26.269> degree<00:00:27.269> angle<00:00:27.689> into<00:00:28.460> so<00:00:29.460> it's<00:00:30.179> easy<00:00:30.510> to

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
a 45 degree angle into so it's easy to

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.799 
a 45 degree angle into so it's easy to
hang<00:00:31.019> all<00:00:31.980> you<00:00:32.160> do<00:00:32.369> is<00:00:32.700> I'm<00:00:33.360> going<00:00:33.510> to<00:00:33.570> show<00:00:33.660> you

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
the angle it's a 45 degree angle on a

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.940 
the angle it's a 45 degree angle on a
regular<00:00:37.800> 2x4<00:00:38.430> and<00:00:38.610> it's<00:00:39.210> removable<00:00:39.719> so<00:00:40.590> you

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
regular 2x4 and it's removable so you

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.060 
regular 2x4 and it's removable so you
remove<00:00:41.640> that<00:00:41.670> you<00:00:42.149> wouldn't<00:00:42.989> you<00:00:43.350> would<00:00:43.559> screw

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
remove that you wouldn't you would screw

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.790 
remove that you wouldn't you would screw
that<00:00:44.250> into<00:00:44.730> the<00:00:44.820> wall<00:00:45.000> and<00:00:45.239> then<00:00:46.140> all<00:00:46.469> you<00:00:46.649> have

to<00:00:46.980> do<00:00:47.190> is<00:00:48.950> hook<00:00:49.950> the<00:00:50.219> nesting<00:00:51.090> box<00:00:51.300> right<00:00:51.600> onto

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
to do is hook the nesting box right onto

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.680 
to do is hook the nesting box right onto
that<00:00:51.960> and<00:00:52.320> there<00:00:53.280> you<00:00:53.370> go<00:00:53.550> easy<00:00:53.789> as<00:00:54.239> pie

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
to the front to the front of the right

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
to the front to the front of the right
which<00:02:40.020> that<00:02:40.260> prevents<00:02:40.830> this<00:02:41.610> piece<00:02:41.910> here

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
which that prevents this piece here

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:47.290 
which that prevents this piece here
prevents<00:02:43.440> the<00:02:43.620> egg<00:02:43.740> from<00:02:43.980> falling<00:02:44.490> out<00:02:45.440> and

prevents the egg from falling out and

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:51.170 
prevents the egg from falling out and
breaking<00:02:48.300> obviously<00:02:48.600> so<00:02:49.580> what<00:02:50.580> happens<00:02:50.970> is

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
breaking obviously so what happens is

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.620 
breaking obviously so what happens is

the egg is going to roll forward it's

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:56.150 
the egg is going to roll forward it's
going<00:02:54.900> to<00:02:55.020> fall<00:02:55.230> through<00:02:55.320> the<00:02:55.739> knotch

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
going to fall through the knotch
