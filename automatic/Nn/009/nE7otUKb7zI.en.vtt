accidentally<00:01:19.060> cut<00:01:19.390> your<00:01:19.540> templates<00:01:20.370> with

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:21.370 
accidentally cut your templates with

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:25.570 
your craft knife but you want to move

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:27.690 
your craft knife but you want to move
the<00:01:25.840> paper<00:01:26.050> I<00:01:26.440> find<00:01:26.800> that<00:01:26.980> moving<00:01:27.190> the<00:01:27.490> paper

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:27.700 
the paper I find that moving the paper

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:37.410 
the paper I find that moving the paper
helps<00:01:30.540> to<00:01:31.540> cut<00:01:31.780> it<00:01:31.900> out<00:01:32.020> more<00:01:32.260> easily<00:01:36.120> so<00:01:37.120> after

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:37.420 
helps to cut it out more easily so after

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.500 
helps to cut it out more easily so after
you<00:01:37.600> get<00:01:37.750> done<00:01:37.960> cutting<00:01:38.410> out<00:01:39.120> both<00:01:40.120> of<00:01:40.360> your

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:40.510 
you get done cutting out both of your

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:43.590 
you get done cutting out both of your
flaps<00:01:40.900> I<00:01:41.500> like<00:01:42.250> to<00:01:42.400> come<00:01:42.640> back<00:01:42.790> with<00:01:42.970> my<00:01:43.120> eraser

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:23.320 
book but not on the flaps because the

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:25.680 
book but not on the flaps because the
flaps<00:02:23.680> can<00:02:24.370> be<00:02:24.640> glued<00:02:24.910> down<00:02:25.030> later<00:02:25.330> but<00:02:25.540> they

flaps can be glued down later but they

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:28.140 
flaps can be glued down later but they
tend<00:02:25.989> to<00:02:26.020> get<00:02:26.170> in<00:02:26.290> the<00:02:26.320> way<00:02:26.530> and<00:02:27.459> you<00:02:27.580> also<00:02:27.760> want

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
tend to get in the way and you also want

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.720 
tend to get in the way and you also want
to<00:02:28.239> make<00:02:28.959> sure<00:02:29.110> you've<00:02:29.320> folded<00:02:29.860> your<00:02:30.220> flaps<00:02:30.489> to

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
to make sure you've folded your flaps to

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:32.640 
to make sure you've folded your flaps to
get<00:02:30.850> them<00:02:31.000> out<00:02:31.150> of<00:02:31.239> the<00:02:31.330> way<00:02:31.450> too<00:02:31.510> so<00:02:32.290> you<00:02:32.350> see

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
get them out of the way too so you see

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:34.830 
get them out of the way too so you see
how<00:02:32.770> I<00:02:32.800> can<00:02:33.130> slide<00:02:33.459> my<00:02:33.670> paper<00:02:33.700> on<00:02:34.120> here<00:02:34.450> since<00:02:34.720> I

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
how I can slide my paper on here since I

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.449 
how I can slide my paper on here since I

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:36.459 
put the glue on the book instead of

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:38.550 
put the glue on the book instead of
putting<00:02:36.670> the<00:02:36.850> glue<00:02:37.030> on<00:02:37.180> the<00:02:37.239> paper<00:02:37.480> I<00:02:37.870> can
