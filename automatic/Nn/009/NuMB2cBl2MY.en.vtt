simple<00:00:54.149> basically<00:00:55.019> you<00:00:55.079> have<00:00:55.170> an<00:00:55.289> on<00:00:55.409> and<00:00:55.769> off

00:00:55.849 --> 00:00:55.859 
simple basically you have an on and off

00:00:55.859 --> 00:00:58.310 
simple basically you have an on and off
button<00:00:56.309> so<00:00:56.999> it'll<00:00:57.239> either<00:00:57.329> be<00:00:57.449> turned<00:00:58.140> on<00:00:58.260> or

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
button so it'll either be turned on or

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.059 
button so it'll either be turned on or
turned<00:00:58.530> off<00:00:58.920> there's<00:00:59.670> nothing<00:01:00.149> a<00:01:00.179> little

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:01.069 
turned off there's nothing a little

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:02.959 
turned off there's nothing a little
programming<00:01:02.069> that<00:01:02.309> you<00:01:02.460> have<00:01:02.550> to<00:01:02.670> do<00:01:02.789> it<00:01:02.940> just

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
programming that you have to do it just

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.690 
programming that you have to do it just
on<00:01:03.269> or<00:01:03.480> off<00:01:03.600> it's<00:01:03.809> great<00:01:04.050> now<00:01:04.800> out<00:01:05.309> of<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:05.489> box

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
on or off it's great now out of the box

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.130 
on or off it's great now out of the box
it<00:01:06.000> comes<00:01:06.210> with<00:01:06.270> a<00:01:06.420> few<00:01:06.600> different<00:01:06.659> mounting

one is going to be for not water

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.709 
one is going to be for not water
resistant<00:01:38.399> but<00:01:38.579> it's<00:01:38.820> mainly<00:01:39.030> about<00:01:39.390> the

00:01:39.709 --> 00:01:39.719

noise<00:01:39.899> you<00:01:40.229> know<00:01:40.860> if<00:01:40.950> I<00:01:41.399> you're<00:01:41.610> trying<00:01:41.909> to

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
noise you know if I you're trying to

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.870 
noise you know if I you're trying to
pick<00:01:42.210> up<00:01:42.469> better<00:01:43.469> sound<00:01:43.860> and<00:01:44.189> there's<00:01:44.340> low

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
pick up better sound and there's low

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.450 
pick up better sound and there's low
noise<00:01:45.119> I<00:01:45.539> can<00:01:46.229> use<00:01:46.350> this<00:01:46.530> back<00:01:46.770> cap<00:01:47.039> it's

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
noise I can use this back cap it's

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:48.920 
noise I can use this back cap it's
basically<00:01:47.880> got<00:01:48.090> a<00:01:48.119> hole<00:01:48.299> in<00:01:48.329> the<00:01:48.479> back<00:01:48.659> of<00:01:48.840> it

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
basically got a hole in the back of it

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.539 
basically got a hole in the back of it
for<00:01:49.320> better<00:01:49.439> sound<00:01:49.710> transmission<00:01:50.250> through

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
for better sound transmission through

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.969 
for better sound transmission through
the<00:01:50.729> south<00:01:50.939> side<00:01:51.210> of<00:01:51.270> the<00:01:51.359> camera<00:01:51.740> now<00:01:52.740> you<00:01:52.799> can
