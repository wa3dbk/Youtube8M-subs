00:00:01.499 --> 00:00:08.769
 good afternoon to you in the afternoon sometime there 

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:11.950
 downloaded showed it probably 

00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:13.660
 our solar you to the furnace but now I 

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:16.960
 I want to show you a little how she is 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:23.140
 really works here you see here 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:25.080
 glass now I'll open that's it 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:31.200
 there was already a frame 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:38.199
 the frame is already heated by here you see your 

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:40.629
 left interrupt update 1 1 dirt we 

00:00:38.199 --> 00:00:43.000
 here of course on occasion if more there 

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:46.149
 technologically there more perfect 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:52.329
 technique it can be better for him 

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:54.879
 clean but in sunshine 

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:57.609
 it 's somewhere we'll talk right there 

00:00:54.879 --> 00:01:00.250
 and on 35 street here somewhere 

00:00:57.609 --> 00:01:04.659
 Well, maybe a degree 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:10.780
 50 is and here at this temperature here 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:15.729
 about going here is melting here 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:18.490
 I already take this one off 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:22.659
 there is no longer at least sunny 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:25.780
 extractors already no longer drowns them 

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:27.720
 Take off and now I will load the ears of the Christmas tree-stick 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:32.680
 hot see now got caught 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:35.829
 very hot hot hot with us 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:44.700
 due to the fact that here is galvanized 

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:44.700
 it heats up well this way 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:52.049
 a little glorified does not flow 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:54.789
 wax flows down here an hour I will show it 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:55.479
 here it looks like a box that's a watch 

00:01:54.789 --> 00:02:03.039
 pulled out 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:02:11.230
 I will show you this box to understand 

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:14.260
 understand their coffin over there yes that's such 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:17.860
 the thing we get here is mastic and 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:19.900
 ms-1 then with another then with 3 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:23.440
 here and he is typed and then typed 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:28.079
 then we will change it and randomly frame 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:32.980
 there on the frame for it is finally 

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:40.150
 here we have a small one such boards 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:42.910
 in this beats at an angle here 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:45.129
 galvanizing see dug here 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:52.139
 such a small pocket 

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:52.139
 through which leakage occurs 

00:02:52.349 --> 00:03:01.690
 one more rush just frame frame i 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:05.019
 I donâ€™t know now at least something 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:07.180
 what do you think about dinner and apparently they are to me 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:11.769
 not met is called one more and 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:17.349
 Until ranka Feeder once remember my 

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:20.019
 grandfather were such children give out the same beat 

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:21.639
 moth she was afraid of me lying in 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:26.530
 one place in general is not one his 

00:03:21.639 --> 00:03:29.889
 forgetting here is the way 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:33.540
 Subcorus here here I chose his tesla part 

00:03:29.889 --> 00:03:36.760
 Here podkorka and Charlz Wood 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:38.859
 syrup and bees from here with pleasure 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:40.900
 to easily see more than once grew 

00:03:38.859 --> 00:03:43.359
 a day you can several times it 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:47.040
 add a little bit and having for example in 

00:03:43.359 --> 00:03:49.840
 beehive such a framework so that the few 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:53.889
 painless just can be over here 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:54.360
 grams 150 200 will enter here 5 such frames 

00:03:53.889 --> 00:03:57.900
 and 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:04:01.110
 liter look like this here 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:03.240
 a little trouble for you i spent it 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:07.830
 now from here I put a box on you 

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:11.280
 detail a couple of hours with intense sun 

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:18.920
 this whole thing melts and stays 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:18.920
 one interrupt right was considered to be 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:26.940
 you see 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:29.100
 I cover her all and she stands in the sun but 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:31.350
 for in order to increase some 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:33.680
 a corner so that there is a majority of the topic 

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:33.680
 to lift 

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:39.690
 put a brick under it you're here 

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:41.970
 would have expired good on the news seen 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:45.919
 melts and again the authorities will interrupt something 

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:53.490
 my father help 

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:55.140
 master well you see here a little bit 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:57.419
 heats up how much has passed somewhere in the world 

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:58.380
 twenty passed to we set and now 

00:04:57.419 --> 00:05:01.610
 that's the edge 

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:07.530
 already bends now open 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:15.479
 here's the last you see, he's already the planet 

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:17.970
 we have a little more and already wire 

00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:20.940
 it begins to appear under the weight 

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:24.840
 its already falling and getting on 

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:28.880
 hot galvanized galvanized metal 

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:28.880
 she put everything in there and immediately
