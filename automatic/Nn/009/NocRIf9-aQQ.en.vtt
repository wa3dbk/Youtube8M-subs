00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:05.509
 hello how about everyone and manning names and 

00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:08.570
 then on this occasion to make this video 

00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:10.850
 is to tell you about an experiment that 

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:15.100
 I'm about to do 

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:17.720
 It turns out that a couple of months ago I 

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:19.310
 came the idea of ​​letting me grow 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:21.120
 hair 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:24.210
 mainly the opposite 

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:26.670
 where but in the game the image that my 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.390
 Hair grows very slowly so as 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:32.059
 I was looking for there this 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:34.160
 home remedies to accelerate the 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:36.110
 hair growth and then I 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.410
 I found one that can be medium 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:38.410
 simple 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:45.670
 and it's about the shampoo with onion 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:47.860
 I was looking for several videos and the 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:50.620
 truth is that 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:52.690
 in all the videos that came out were 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:55.720
 women talking about accounts and 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:59.130
 recommending the shampoo and despite that 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:02.670
 there were several this 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:04.380
 comments of not one of several of 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.110
 men who also asked that if 

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:09.200
 that remedy the shampoo also 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.450
 it would work for men 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.490
 the truth that none had an answer 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:15.590
 taxes I stayed a multi list equal 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.210
 with the same doubt then I did not say good 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:19.700
 I will treat the total 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:21.430
 I can lose tokyo so I'm going to 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.650
 try 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:25.600
 and this in this way yes to some of 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:28.540
 you are seeing if they have any 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:31.750
 question or any doubt or anything 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:34.660
 Well, I know what I'm going to be 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:37.960
 Experiencing as who says and if to me 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:39.640
 it has happened to me has not happened to me any 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:41.710
 thing that is that any change that 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:43.360
 notes so I'll let you know and if 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:45.630
 I can answer your question because I'm going 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:45.630
 to do 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:51.830
 Well, if you saw in my videos here 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:55.790
 or up here something like that is the video of 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:57.229
 how how to make the shampoo is very simple 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:59.750
 only they have to do in summary 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:01.340
 it is chopping the onion depends on the 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:04.490
 size of the onion is a 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:06.560
 more medianita onion if it is very large 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:09.149
 no more half depends on you from 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.709
 calculate our minus 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.769
 they are given to the campus they are going to use 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:18.140
 this regularly me here I already have my 

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:18.140
 shampoo this one already takes 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:24.660
 nine days at rest where they are missing 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:28.280
 still a few more 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:28.280
 the shampoo that I used 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:36.710
 aloe shampoo 3 ávila is of law that 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:38.780
 Aloe also helps to nourish the 

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:40.940
 hair and often put something like that 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:42.980
 so then when I saw that shampoo 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:44.750
 I said no, I'm going to treat it and then with 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:47.990
 the onion and with the aloe and therefore 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:50.590
 better works a little better not and if 

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:53.170
 this is the time that I used 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:55.569
 Here you have the onion which is what 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:57.700
 we will do well let's let 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:03:00.069
 as I mentioned in the video also in 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:01.720
 the other you saw me let it rest for 15 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:03.550
 selected days transit is left 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:06.400
 rest for 15 days i what am i 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:07.930
 doing is that the cycle toya waves every 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.890
 day 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:14.500
 now some of the questions that I lived 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:17.319
 and that they have no answer was that if the 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:19.450
 onion is going to be removed or is it going to 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:22.480
 leave when the shampoo is ready 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:25.400
 15 days, what I'm going to do is 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:29.799
 leave my onions out of bread 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:29.799
 another thing is also that 

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:35.870
 I'm going to use it the first time I 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:39.950
 I will use it at night for two 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:43.040
 reasons the first because here of this 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:45.020
 way we could not go to sleep the same 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:47.900
 to do is that I dried up and so I do not go 

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:49.490
 to take anything after that I will 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:53.240
 do nothing I 'm not going to show what's going to 

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:56.000
 let be natural and the second one is 

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:58.640
 because many have the doubt already this 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.430
 tool in a fear of you going to 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:03.590
 smell a little more of the hair then 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:07.250
 ine what is that you say that when 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:10.220
 once it dries stop smelling but 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:12.050
 good for while and while not for that 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:14.840
 will leave it at night so that 

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:16.820
 if the next day I see that I still 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:19.070
 it hurts a little onion or it smells 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:21.640
 a lot I do not know how much bigger or led 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:24.000
 where can I put to bathe again 

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:26.770
 collection 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.870
 and well, that's all 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:32.169
 As I say to my entry, I still have a 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:34.479
 couple of days a few more days to 

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:36.789
 that is ready if there were any 

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:39.249
 question do not hesitate to ask it if I know 

00:04:36.789 --> 00:04:41.859
 the answers I will answer 

00:04:39.249 --> 00:04:44.889
 and if they have some two networks their 

00:04:41.859 --> 00:04:47.529
 deficiencies or students you have 

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:49.639
 treated already and if it has worked for them that 

00:04:47.529 --> 00:04:51.710
 they have done that they have not done 

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:55.219
 well in a comment of your videos 

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:58.580
 send the message and well then that's 

00:04:55.219 --> 00:05:01.120
 everything is careful that we do not continue to see 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:01.120
 the next
