00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:23.990 
using a first here perk at all that's

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:25.300 
using a first here perk at all that's
because<00:01:24.290> i<00:01:24.380> feel<00:01:24.590> none<00:01:24.860> of<00:01:24.950> them<00:01:25.070> are<00:01:25.190> really

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:25.310 
because i feel none of them are really

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:27.789 
because i feel none of them are really
necessary<00:01:25.970> when<00:01:26.570> playing<00:01:26.810> in<00:01:26.990> an<00:01:27.080> FFA<00:01:27.530> match

whereas<00:01:28.700> scavenger<00:01:29.479> and<00:01:29.510> toughness<00:01:29.960> are<00:01:30.170> just

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:30.409 
whereas scavenger and toughness are just

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:32.950 
whereas scavenger and toughness are just
essentials<00:01:30.950> for<00:01:31.100> me<00:01:31.250> i<00:01:31.400> cannot<00:01:32.150> i<00:01:32.390> cannot<00:01:32.510> do

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:32.960

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.020 
anymore I kind of spoiled myself I

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:37.929

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:42.880 
ever since I just can't a too well in a
game<00:01:41.479> without<00:01:41.750> him<00:01:42.080> so<00:01:42.470> that's<00:01:42.590> what<00:01:42.799> I'm

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:42.890 
game without him so that's what I'm

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:44.830 
game without him so that's what I'm
rolling<00:01:43.130> with<00:01:43.159> there<00:01:43.549> and<00:01:43.759> then<00:01:44.240> i'm<00:01:44.659> also

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
rolling with there and then i'm also

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.219 
rolling with there and then i'm also
using<00:01:44.960> the<00:01:45.909> absolutely<00:01:46.909> the<00:01:47.150> tac-45<00:01:47.659> you<00:01:48.080> guys

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:48.229 
using the absolutely the tac-45 you guys

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:49.840 
using the absolutely the tac-45 you guys
that's<00:01:48.409> obvious<00:01:48.860> and<00:01:49.009> then<00:01:49.490> for<00:01:49.759> the

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:49.850 
that's obvious and then for the

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:52.210 
that's obvious and then for the
attachments<00:01:50.450> i<00:01:50.509> believe<00:01:50.979> let's<00:01:51.979> say<00:01:52.130> i'm

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:52.220 
attachments i believe let's say i'm

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:54.340 
attachments i believe let's say i'm
using<00:01:52.490> long<00:01:52.880> barrel<00:01:53.210> and<00:01:53.360> then<00:01:53.600> fast<00:01:53.900> mag<00:01:54.170> as

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:54.350 
using long barrel and then fast mag as

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:56.440 
using long barrel and then fast mag as
well<00:01:54.530> for<00:01:54.770> this<00:01:54.860> quicker<00:01:55.220> reloads<00:01:55.610> i<00:01:55.790> wouldn't

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:56.450 
well for this quicker reloads i wouldn't

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:58.060 
well for this quicker reloads i wouldn't
recommend<00:01:56.509> using<00:01:56.930> extended<00:01:57.530> clip<00:01:57.770> on<00:01:57.920> this

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:58.070 
recommend using extended clip on this

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:59.679 
recommend using extended clip on this
gun<00:01:58.250> guys<00:01:58.490> if<00:01:58.729> you're<00:01:58.850> if<00:01:59.030> you<00:01:59.150> want<00:01:59.329> to<00:01:59.390> try<00:01:59.630> it

00:01:59.679 --> 00:01:59.689 
gun guys if you're if you want to try it

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:01.899 
gun guys if you're if you want to try it
out<00:01:59.840> because<00:02:00.439> it<00:02:00.710> only<00:02:00.890> increases<00:02:01.400> the<00:02:01.700> mag

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:01.909 
out because it only increases the mag

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:04.510 
out because it only increases the mag
size<00:02:02.210> from<00:02:02.479> 10<00:02:02.780> to<00:02:02.930> 13<00:02:03.290> bullets<00:02:03.619> which<00:02:03.799> is<00:02:03.979> very

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:04.520 
size from 10 to 13 bullets which is very

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.340 
size from 10 to 13 bullets which is very
insignificant<00:02:04.909> i<00:02:05.509> wouldn't<00:02:05.990> recommend<00:02:06.049> that

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:06.350 
insignificant i wouldn't recommend that

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:08.169 
insignificant i wouldn't recommend that
at<00:02:06.500> all<00:02:06.560> a<00:02:06.770> fast<00:02:07.250> mag<00:02:07.460> is<00:02:07.610> definitely<00:02:08.060> the

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179 
at all a fast mag is definitely the

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:09.910 
at all a fast mag is definitely the
better<00:02:08.300> way<00:02:08.509> to<00:02:08.539> go<00:02:08.660> other<00:02:09.289> than<00:02:09.530> that<00:02:09.649> i'm

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 
better way to go other than that i'm

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:11.320 
better way to go other than that i'm
using<00:02:09.950> the<00:02:10.250> bouncing<00:02:10.670> betty<00:02:10.910> and<00:02:11.180> the

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.330 
using the bouncing betty and the

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:12.500 
using the bouncing betty and the
concussion<00:02:11.930> grenade

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
concussion grenade

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.750 
concussion grenade
and<00:02:12.629> these<00:02:13.379> are<00:02:13.439> just<00:02:13.830> the<00:02:13.950> bouncing<00:02:14.489> betty<00:02:14.670> I

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
and these are just the bouncing betty I

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.429 
and these are just the bouncing betty I
know<00:02:14.970> it's<00:02:15.269> a<00:02:15.330> little<00:02:15.450> controversial<00:02:16.049> some

00:02:16.429 --> 00:02:16.439 
know it's a little controversial some

00:02:16.439 --> 00:02:18.229 
know it's a little controversial some
people<00:02:16.799> might<00:02:16.980> give<00:02:17.340> a<00:02:17.370> little<00:02:17.610> hate<00:02:17.879> on<00:02:18.030> me

00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:18.239 
people might give a little hate on me

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:20.539 
people might give a little hate on me
for<00:02:18.269> using<00:02:18.629> it<00:02:18.870> but<00:02:19.319> I'm<00:02:19.379> okay<00:02:19.950> with<00:02:20.099> that<00:02:20.129> but

00:02:20.539 --> 00:02:20.549 
for using it but I'm okay with that but

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:22.670 
for using it but I'm okay with that but
I<00:02:21.090> probably<00:02:21.840> won't<00:02:22.019> use<00:02:22.260> it<00:02:22.290> in<00:02:22.500> future

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
I probably won't use it in future

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.039 
I probably won't use it in future
episodes<00:02:22.860> but<00:02:23.459> it<00:02:23.579> does<00:02:23.849> really<00:02:24.239> help<00:02:24.450> an<00:02:24.629> FFA

00:02:25.039 --> 00:02:25.049 
episodes but it does really help an FFA

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:27.470 
episodes but it does really help an FFA
for<00:02:25.439> controlling<00:02:26.069> an<00:02:26.159> area<00:02:26.489> and<00:02:26.760> you'll<00:02:27.269> see

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
for controlling an area and you'll see

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.089 
for controlling an area and you'll see
I'm<00:02:27.629> kind<00:02:27.870> of<00:02:27.989> trying<00:02:28.170> to<00:02:28.349> hold<00:02:28.530> down<00:02:28.620> this
