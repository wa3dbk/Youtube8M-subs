waterproof but I will tell you this is
and<00:02:21.480> I'll<00:02:21.569> take<00:02:21.750> it<00:02:21.870> in<00:02:21.989> salt<00:02:22.260> water<00:02:22.459> swimming

and I'll take it in salt water swimming
pools<00:02:24.019> you<00:02:25.019> name<00:02:25.230> it<00:02:25.439> the<00:02:25.650> river<00:02:25.890> and<00:02:26.629> it

00:02:27.619 --> 00:02:27.629 
pools you name it the river and it

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:30.349 
pools you name it the river and it
hasn't<00:02:27.989> leaked<00:02:28.170> and<00:02:28.439> it's<00:02:29.370> got<00:02:29.519> this<00:02:29.730> lock<00:02:30.060> on

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:30.359 
hasn't leaked and it's got this lock on

00:02:30.359 --> 00:02:33.259 
hasn't leaked and it's got this lock on
it<00:02:30.390> which<00:02:31.170> is<00:02:31.349> a<00:02:31.379> nice<00:02:31.650> feature<00:02:31.709> because<00:02:32.269> if

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:33.269 
it which is a nice feature because if

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:36.080 
it which is a nice feature because if
you<00:02:33.450> are<00:02:33.629> in<00:02:33.780> the<00:02:33.810> water<00:02:34.049> and<00:02:34.379> you<00:02:35.129> some

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
you are in the water and you some

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.740 
you are in the water and you some
cameras<00:02:36.510> don't<00:02:37.819> don't<00:02:38.819> have<00:02:39.420> a<00:02:39.450> lock

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
cameras don't don't have a lock

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.539 
cameras don't don't have a lock
mechanism<00:02:40.349> like<00:02:40.439> that<00:02:40.680> that<00:02:40.950> visually

00:02:41.539 --> 00:02:41.549 
mechanism like that that visually

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:43.819 
mechanism like that that visually
confirms<00:02:41.939> it<00:02:42.180> it's<00:02:42.299> locked<00:02:42.540> so<00:02:43.349> that's<00:02:43.530> a<00:02:43.650> nice

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:43.829 
confirms it it's locked so that's a nice

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:47.300 
confirms it it's locked so that's a nice
touch<00:02:44.159> the<00:02:45.090> only<00:02:45.359> thing<00:02:45.569> that<00:02:45.750> I<00:02:45.980> could<00:02:46.980> say<00:02:47.250> so

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
touch the only thing that I could say so

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.929 
touch the only thing that I could say so
far<00:02:47.849> that's<00:02:49.010> somewhat<00:02:50.010> negative<00:02:50.280> about<00:02:50.700> this

00:02:50.929 --> 00:02:50.939 
far that's somewhat negative about this

00:02:50.939 --> 00:02:53.780 
far that's somewhat negative about this
camera<00:02:51.359> and<00:02:51.709> by<00:02:52.709> no<00:02:52.769> means<00:02:53.220> should<00:02:53.430> this<00:02:53.579> be

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
camera and by no means should this be

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.089 
camera and by no means should this be
considered<00:02:54.000> a<00:02:54.329> deal<00:02:54.569> breaker<00:02:54.810> but<00:02:55.799> you<00:02:55.919> can

00:02:56.089 --> 00:02:56.099 
considered a deal breaker but you can

00:02:56.099 --> 00:03:01.670 
considered a deal breaker but you can
see<00:02:56.310> the<00:02:56.689> the<00:02:57.689> silver<00:02:58.169> coloured<00:03:00.439> thing<00:03:01.439> around

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
see the the silver coloured thing around

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.879 
see the the silver coloured thing around
the<00:03:01.859> lens<00:03:02.750> that<00:03:03.750> can<00:03:04.019> create<00:03:04.230> problems

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:04.889 
the lens that can create problems

00:03:04.889 --> 00:03:06.830 
the lens that can create problems
especially<00:03:05.099> if<00:03:05.639> you're<00:03:05.819> filming<00:03:06.209> directly

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840

surrounds the lens if they did that in
my<00:04:04.919> opinion<00:04:05.040> they<00:04:05.489> would<00:04:05.609> have<00:04:05.729> a<00:04:05.759> perfect

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:06.269 
my opinion they would have a perfect

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:07.969 
my opinion they would have a perfect
camera<00:04:06.509> I<00:04:06.870> thought<00:04:07.560> the<00:04:07.709> price<00:04:07.949> was

00:04:07.969 --> 00:04:07.979 
camera I thought the price was

00:04:07.979 --> 00:04:10.759 
camera I thought the price was
reasonable<00:04:08.720> one<00:04:09.720> final<00:04:10.229> thing<00:04:10.409> I'd<00:04:10.590> like<00:04:10.620> to

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:10.769 
reasonable one final thing I'd like to

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:13.819 
reasonable one final thing I'd like to
