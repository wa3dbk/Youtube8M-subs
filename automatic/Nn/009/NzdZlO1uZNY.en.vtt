00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.760
 this manip works now it works 

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:17.950
 very well and I feel it needs to 

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:21.520
 explain to me then in fact we had created 

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:24.220
 here a radar system is so the goal 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:26.140
 it's coming to identify and locate 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:27.700
 all the targets that are going to be in 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:29.079
 this piece is going to have you 

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:31.750
 explain to me better because for me a 

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:33.130
 radar these gear that waiting for me on 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:34.000
 the roadside and I think by 

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:35.649
 hatch is the same thing 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.629
 it's a bit the same principle finally 

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:42.160
 yes yes so can I explain with 

00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:43.510
 the schema that is here then we have two 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:45.760
 antennas an antenna resignation a 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:47.289
 receiving antenna 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:50.019
 the resigning antenna will generate a signal 

00:00:47.289 --> 00:00:53.379
 radar that will come to be reflected on a 

00:00:50.019 --> 00:00:54.460
 of our targets the signal will be reflected 

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:55.170
 and be picked up by the antenna of 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:58.480
 reception 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.489
 okay okay and so looking 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:01.120
 the difference between the transmitted signal and the 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:02.979
 received signal 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:05.409
 and knowing the speed of propagation 

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:07.570
 of the ondh we will be able to deduce the 

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:11.500
 distance because of differences in 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:13.689
 time between the signal alley and its 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:16.000
 back this is basically he put some 

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:20.219
 time to make the round trip and this 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.219
 time and pictures of the chord position 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:27.040
 yesterday so the 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:29.290
 radâmes he is there that's it then for 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:31.030
 do this assembly we finally need 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:33.100
 some electronic components 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:35.350
 basic one has a generator that is going 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:38.410
 emit our radar signal a divider 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:40.960
 a power multiplier and 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:42.820
 amps as well as so our antenna 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.760
 transmission and reception 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:47.230
 illuminate our targets ok but practically 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:49.150
 how do you get the 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:51.280
 folder position then if you want 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:52.840
 that the position of the targets we will do 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.030
 a single acquisition like this in 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.500
 static and we will have the 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:58.840
 position by processing the received signal 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.520
 however, the purpose of the project is 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.560
 can also identify targets in 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.880
 function of their shape and so for that 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.160
 we will make several acquisitions in 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.510
 turning the block is so you're going 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:08.890
 able to do a demonstration because 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:10.780
 that's why smoking with good 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:12.340
 sure so what are we gonna do 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.660
 to make several acquisitions under 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.630
 different points of view so we're going 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:18.190
 run our engine and then we 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:19.800
 will be able to reconstruct the image thanks to 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:24.300
 all the acquisitions we made 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:24.300
 ok ok so I show you that 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.580
 I 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:33.209
 this is the result of our treatments 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:36.209
 so we find our two cylinders 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:38.870
 view from above in the xy clan we have 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:38.870
 reconstituted 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:47.930
 aluminum and we're going to make a 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.070
 radar image of his profile seen from above 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:53.710
 as before with the sea ​​dogs 

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:53.710
 okay so I'm going to start the rotation 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:58.750
 but then why do you 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:00.970
 used polystyrene as a support 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:03.220
 so the goal here is going to be 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:05.380
 characterize only the target is not 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:06.370
 its support and in fact we use 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:07.750
 polystyrene since it's going to be 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:09.880
 transparent vis-à-vis the radar zones 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:12.640
 still agree what would 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:14.260
 to say that for the measure it's as if 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:18.040
 the car was suspended in 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:20.710
 this is it and if we had 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:21.700
 a support was measured suddenly this is the 

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:24.160
 purpose is that the support 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:28.120
 do not think but is not a 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:29.980
 signature that we can find the 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:32.050
 measure but here we are in a room 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:33.880
 very loose and especially with 

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:36.430
 metal objects that need to think 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:37.510
 the waves then we do how to do 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:39.940
 first a first acquisition of 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:41.560
 the whole room without the target then the 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:43.270
 same question with the target and then 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:47.170
 we will subtract the two for 

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:48.880
 optimize the image of steel so there we 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:51.250
 see the acquisition that is done in time 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:53.860
 real meaning that we rebuild 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:55.480
 the image little by little thanks to all the 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:57.010
 signals that we will receive for each 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:59.200
 point of view 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:01.900
 the vehicle that is destined nothing to see 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:04.360
 with the stressful measure so there we have 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:07.810
 symbolized this is the theoretical object for 

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:10.780
 we here in truth here are our points of 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:13.000
 measure so we see that red areas 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:17.200
 are the ones that sign the zones the most 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.510
 typically flat of the car and so 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:22.150
 we see that we manage to rebuild 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:23.230
 almost the identical object and in 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:25.000
 terms of scope what can we 

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:26.290
 to say because there we are very close yes 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.850
 then the door and the door 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:28.740
 basically the power of the 

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:31.060
 emission signal 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:33.580
 so at the signal level we are going 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:35.350
 to emit its intensity will decrease with 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:37.480
 the distance logically so the longer the 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:39.880
 target will be far - leuven sent 

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:41.680
 therefore signal with the materials we 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:43.770
 here we are limited to about 10 meters 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:47.500
 scope 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:49.120
 and it works with metal so no 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:50.620
 easter walking with metal it works 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:52.060
 better with the metal since these 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:54.250
 drivers and that he has a good 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:56.169
 coefficient of reflection in fact one 

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:58.030
 must be easily reflected on 

00:04:56.169 --> 00:04:59.800
 metal unlike other materials 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:01.599
 who will absorb the ondh 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:03.340
 and less thoughtful at a 

00:05:01.599 --> 00:05:05.319
 practical use of this system 

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:07.240
 yes then have applications of this 

00:05:05.319 --> 00:05:10.210
 system are in the civilian domain or 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:12.789
 military especially space we're going 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:14.470
 power through this kind of system come 

00:05:12.789 --> 00:05:17.080
 reconstruct the image of objects present 

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:19.240
 in space like debris or even 

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:20.800
 space shuttles as we can 

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:22.900
 see on this picture where we come to 

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:26.639
 rebuild a shuttle that yet to 

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:26.639
 700 km of altitude
