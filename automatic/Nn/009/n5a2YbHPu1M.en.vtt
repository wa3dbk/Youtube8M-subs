00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 at the motor circus with the Italian champion 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.230
 rally seven times than for Italian 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.150
 rally paolo andreucci paolo 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.580
 first let's talk a little bit about 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:15.900
 how do you see is what you are doing this 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:19.529
 event but now we are in version 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:25.340
 historical in the sense that we turn with the 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:30.330
 historical pirelli with 10 37 and la nel 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:33.120
 in the area in the active area and for which two 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.660
 traverse some show time 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.010
 we'll do another round around 4 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:42.440
 cent programs for the next 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:48.899
 competitive season with we will do with the 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:53.789
 weight the 208 r2 probably six seven 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:55.379
 races and then there is that before the end 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:59.520
 year in short, we can do the 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:05.070
 debut with the 208 r5 always in the cir 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:08.479
 and then later we will see in hope it is 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:12.360
 clearly competitive in 2014 to do 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:13.799
 with the 208 r5 you have always been 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.810
 involved and worked so hard in 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:18.930
 machine developments will be so too 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.520
 for these cars as they seem to you 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.070
 bases on the indications of what 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:27.540
 have already shown in the tests but also 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:30.180
 in the race the r2 is a machine that was born 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.729
 very well already with certain specifications of 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:36.180
 very good base 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:40.079
 we saw friday in paris with con 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:44.189
 resine lion and it's a car really 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:48.390
 done well it is almost reductive to call it 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:51.570
 r2 clearly an engine will have some 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.710
 performance that suitable for the 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.490
 category 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:02:01.070
 however, our task is to seek 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:03.730
 to bring it to be competitive too 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:05.650
 in on Italian roads 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:08.230
 the development is done has been done in 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:10.720
 in france we will do a job in italy 

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:12.340
 with the rect since the on to adapt it to 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.140
 all the routes in Italy so that 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:17.940
 all the pilots all the trophists who the 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:21.040
 usa is above all very competitive 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:23.050
 competitive in the trophy but also in the 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:26.350
 category r2 we want there to be one 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:28.540
 winning machine and we will adapt 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:31.870
 in Italian races there will be precisely 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:34.390
 also set specific settings for 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:38.230
 we will own the Italian championship 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:40.540
 we hope to give a car without 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:42.840
 need to be retouched by dai 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.840
 pilots
