00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:39.770 
Vick because he has so much speed he

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:41.530 
Vick because he has so much speed he

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:41.540 
could roll away from that pressure so

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:43.390

for<00:04:18.269> a<00:04:18.299> quarterback<00:04:18.900> let's<00:04:19.769> take<00:04:19.919> a<00:04:19.979> look<00:04:20.220> at

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:20.310 
for a quarterback let's take a look at

for a quarterback let's take a look at
his<00:04:20.609> throwing<00:04:21.449> stance<00:04:21.870> because<00:04:21.989> this<00:04:22.169> is<00:04:22.259> what

his throwing stance because this is what
really<00:04:22.740> brings<00:04:23.070> the<00:04:23.250> problem<00:04:23.850> for<00:04:24.240> defending

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:25.110 
really brings the problem for defending

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:27.560 
really brings the problem for defending
think<00:04:25.320> he's<00:04:25.440> got<00:04:25.590> 96<00:04:25.919> thermal<00:04:26.220> power<00:04:26.370> 86<00:04:27.030> short

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:27.570

think he's got 96 thermal power 86 short
87<00:04:28.229> middle<00:04:28.500> and<00:04:28.680> 84<00:04:29.669> deep<00:04:29.910> drivers<00:04:30.389> and<00:04:30.630> here's

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:30.930 
87 middle and 84 deep drivers and here's

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:33.740 
87 middle and 84 deep drivers and here's
the<00:04:31.169> kicker<00:04:31.530> 98<00:04:32.400> throw<00:04:32.669> on<00:04:32.820> the<00:04:32.910> run<00:04:32.940> this<00:04:33.600> is

the kicker 98 throw on the run this is

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:35.480 
the kicker 98 throw on the run this is
what<00:04:33.900> makes<00:04:34.050> Michael<00:04:34.470> Vick<00:04:34.620> so<00:04:34.919> dangerous<00:04:35.370> so

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:36.570 
let's take a look at how we're going to

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:39.379 
let's take a look at how we're going to
stop<00:04:36.810> them<00:04:37.020> with<00:04:37.199> the<00:04:37.590> upcoming<00:04:38.009> play<00:04:38.389> all

right guys so we're going to take a look

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:42.409 
right guys so we're going to take a look
at<00:04:40.800> the<00:04:40.889> nickel<00:04:41.250> normal<00:04:41.610> formation<00:04:42.150> and<00:04:42.360> I

00:04:42.409 --> 00:04:42.419 
at the nickel normal formation and I

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:43.580 
at the nickel normal formation and I
want<00:04:42.600> to<00:04:42.660> stress<00:04:42.900> something<00:04:43.259> right<00:04:43.380> off<00:04:43.470> the

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:43.590 
want to stress something right off the

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:46.670 
want to stress something right off the
get-go<00:04:43.800> you<00:04:44.610> don't<00:04:44.940> have<00:04:45.300> to<00:04:45.600> use<00:04:45.930> the<00:04:46.350> nickel

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:46.680 
get-go you don't have to use the nickel

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:49.159 
get-go you don't have to use the nickel
normal<00:04:46.979> formation<00:04:47.490> this<00:04:47.639> is<00:04:47.789> just<00:04:48.030> a<00:04:48.240> guidance

00:04:49.159 --> 00:04:49.169 
normal formation this is just a guidance

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:51.320 
normal formation this is just a guidance
its<00:04:49.350> way<00:04:49.530> of<00:04:49.770> showing<00:04:50.070> okay<00:04:50.250> so<00:04:50.310> you<00:04:50.880> can<00:04:51.060> use

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:51.330 
its way of showing okay so you can use

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:53.150 
its way of showing okay so you can use
it<00:04:51.360> from<00:04:51.900> the<00:04:52.080> nickel<00:04:52.350> normal<00:04:52.650> but<00:04:52.800> it's<00:04:52.889> more

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:53.160 
it from the nickel normal but it's more

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:56.840 
it from the nickel normal but it's more
of<00:04:53.220> a<00:04:53.460> idea<00:04:54.270> more<00:04:54.690> of<00:04:54.780> a<00:04:55.130> theory<00:04:56.130> if<00:04:56.430> you<00:04:56.610> will

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:56.850 
of a idea more of a theory if you will

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:59.390 
of a idea more of a theory if you will
how<00:04:57.210> to<00:04:57.270> stop<00:04:57.900> Vic<00:04:58.289> so<00:04:58.830> first<00:04:59.070> thing<00:04:59.220> we<00:04:59.310> want

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:00.600 
to take a look at is we want to bring

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:02.510 
to take a look at is we want to bring
pressure<00:05:00.840> from<00:05:01.199> either<00:05:01.500> side<00:05:01.830> of<00:05:01.889> the<00:05:02.100> line<00:05:02.370> of

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:02.520 
pressure from either side of the line of

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:04.370 
pressure from either side of the line of
scrimmage<00:05:02.610> and<00:05:03.030> then<00:05:03.419> on<00:05:03.539> the<00:05:03.660> opposite<00:05:04.139> side

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:04.380 
scrimmage and then on the opposite side

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:06.409 
scrimmage and then on the opposite side
we<00:05:04.560> want<00:05:04.740> to<00:05:04.800> contain<00:05:05.190> and<00:05:05.220> then<00:05:05.580> spy<00:05:06.000> that

00:05:06.409 --> 00:05:06.419 
we want to contain and then spy that

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:08.810 
we want to contain and then spy that
side<00:05:06.900> so<00:05:07.470> here<00:05:07.620> we<00:05:07.650> already<00:05:08.430> actually<00:05:08.669> bring

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:08.820 
side so here we already actually bring

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:10.460 
side so here we already actually bring
pressure<00:05:09.030> from<00:05:09.240> the<00:05:09.330> right<00:05:09.479> side<00:05:09.690> by<00:05:09.930> double<00:05:10.320> a

00:05:19.979 --> 00:05:21.950 
en on a spy we call buffer coverage so
that<00:05:20.009> we<00:05:20.490> have<00:05:20.940> time<00:05:21.210> for<00:05:21.389> the<00:05:21.479> Blitz<00:05:21.720> to<00:05:21.840> get

that we have time for the Blitz to get

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:23.240 
that we have time for the Blitz to get
in<00:05:22.050> there<00:05:22.229> and<00:05:22.260> we're<00:05:22.560> going<00:05:22.680> to<00:05:22.710> user<00:05:22.919> the

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:23.250 
in there and we're going to user the

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:25.279 
in there and we're going to user the
deep<00:05:23.430> free<00:05:23.580> safety<00:05:23.940> on<00:05:24.030> the<00:05:24.120> halfback<00:05:24.539> and<00:05:24.750> use

00:05:25.279 --> 00:05:25.289 
deep free safety on the halfback and use

00:05:25.289 --> 00:05:27.500 
deep free safety on the halfback and use
defensive<00:05:25.740> assist<00:05:26.099> to<00:05:26.460> cover<00:05:26.820> the<00:05:27.060> halfback

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:27.510 
defensive assist to cover the halfback

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:29.629 
defensive assist to cover the halfback
it's<00:05:28.050> gonna<00:05:28.169> make<00:05:28.260> it<00:05:28.380> a<00:05:28.410> lot<00:05:28.440> easier<00:05:28.530> to<00:05:29.220> use

00:05:29.629 --> 00:05:29.639 
it's gonna make it a lot easier to use

00:05:29.639 --> 00:05:31.100 
it's gonna make it a lot easier to use
the<00:05:29.880> assist<00:05:30.210> rather<00:05:30.449> than<00:05:30.660> roam<00:05:30.960> around

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:31.110 
the assist rather than roam around

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:32.450 
the assist rather than roam around
yourself<00:05:31.620> so<00:05:31.830> here<00:05:31.979> as<00:05:32.070> you<00:05:32.130> can<00:05:32.160> see<00:05:32.280> the

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:32.460 
yourself so here as you can see the

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:34.040 
yourself so here as you can see the
pressure<00:05:32.669> comes<00:05:32.940> in<00:05:33.150> and<00:05:33.330> then<00:05:33.720> on<00:05:33.810> the<00:05:33.900> weak

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:34.050 
pressure comes in and then on the weak

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:36.050 
pressure comes in and then on the weak
side<00:05:34.080> that<00:05:34.500> contain<00:05:34.830> keeps<00:05:35.310> Vic<00:05:35.699> in<00:05:35.909> the

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:36.060 
side that contain keeps Vic in the

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:37.760 
side that contain keeps Vic in the
pocket<00:05:36.510> so<00:05:37.020> when<00:05:37.169> we<00:05:37.260> take<00:05:37.349> out<00:05:37.470> a<00:05:37.560> look<00:05:37.680> at

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:37.770 
pocket so when we take out a look at

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:39.140 
pocket so when we take out a look at
instant<00:05:38.130> replay<00:05:38.430> this<00:05:38.550> is<00:05:38.639> real<00:05:38.820> important

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:39.150 
instant replay this is real important

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:41.719 
instant replay this is real important
guys<00:05:39.270> okay<00:05:39.810> so<00:05:39.870> the<00:05:40.020> pressure<00:05:40.260> comes<00:05:40.580> so<00:05:41.580> we

00:05:41.719 --> 00:05:41.729 
guys okay so the pressure comes so we

00:05:41.729 --> 00:05:43.100 
guys okay so the pressure comes so we
can<00:05:41.880> create<00:05:42.090> pressure<00:05:42.389> but<00:05:42.690> that's<00:05:42.840> that's

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:43.110 
can create pressure but that's that's

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:44.689 
can create pressure but that's that's
fine<00:05:43.409> that's<00:05:43.590> that's<00:05:43.949> one<00:05:44.159> thing<00:05:44.310> to<00:05:44.430> create

00:05:44.689 --> 00:05:44.699 
fine that's that's one thing to create

00:05:44.699 --> 00:05:46.310 
fine that's that's one thing to create
the<00:05:44.789> pressure<00:05:45.030> but<00:05:45.300> the<00:05:45.419> problem<00:05:45.780> when<00:05:45.930> facing

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:46.320 
the pressure but the problem when facing

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:48.830 
the pressure but the problem when facing
Vic<00:05:46.530> is<00:05:46.680> that<00:05:46.830> he<00:05:47.010> sa<00:05:47.280> that<00:05:47.729> speed<00:05:48.180> to<00:05:48.449> escape

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:48.840 
Vic is that he sa that speed to escape

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:50.810 
Vic is that he sa that speed to escape
the<00:05:49.050> pressure<00:05:49.320> so<00:05:50.010> here<00:05:50.220> we<00:05:50.340> have<00:05:50.370> the

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:50.820 
the pressure so here we have the

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:52.010 
the pressure so here we have the
pressure<00:05:51.030> coming<00:05:51.270> out<00:05:51.389> the<00:05:51.479> right<00:05:51.630> edge<00:05:51.810> and

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:52.020 
pressure coming out the right edge and

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:53.870 
pressure coming out the right edge and
then<00:05:52.229> we<00:05:52.349> look<00:05:52.500> to<00:05:52.590> scramble<00:05:53.130> to<00:05:53.310> the<00:05:53.370> left<00:05:53.639> and

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:53.880 
then we look to scramble to the left and

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:55.730 
then we look to scramble to the left and
that's<00:05:54.389> when<00:05:54.570> the<00:05:54.599> problem<00:05:55.080> it<00:05:55.169> comes<00:05:55.470> if<00:05:55.650> you

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:55.740 
that's when the problem it comes if you

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:57.620 
that's when the problem it comes if you
don't<00:05:55.949> have<00:05:56.130> that<00:05:56.280> contain<00:05:56.699> there<00:05:57.000> we<00:05:57.449> have<00:05:57.599> a

00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:57.630 
don't have that contain there we have a

00:05:57.630 --> 00:05:59.420 
don't have that contain there we have a
big<00:05:57.960> big<00:05:58.229> issue<00:05:58.470> but<00:05:58.860> this<00:05:58.979> time<00:05:59.130> we<00:05:59.250> have<00:05:59.340> to

00:05:59.420 --> 00:05:59.430 
big big issue but this time we have to

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:01.339 
big big issue but this time we have to
contain<00:05:59.699> that<00:05:59.909> forces<00:06:00.360> Vic<00:06:00.599> in<00:06:00.780> the<00:06:00.900> pocket

00:06:01.339 --> 00:06:01.349 
contain that forces Vic in the pocket

00:06:01.349 --> 00:06:02.810 
contain that forces Vic in the pocket
now<00:06:01.860> I<00:06:01.889> know<00:06:02.130> a<00:06:02.220> lot<00:06:02.310> of<00:06:02.370> people<00:06:02.460> are<00:06:02.639> going<00:06:02.729> to

let's take a bird's eye view see the

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:08.750 
let's take a bird's eye view see the
buffett<00:06:07.380> run<00:06:07.530> I<00:06:07.770> will<00:06:07.800> agree<00:06:08.280> the<00:06:08.400> left<00:06:08.580> slot

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:08.760 
buffett run I will agree the left slot

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:11.060 
buffett run I will agree the left slot

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:11.070 
was open he's in a curl there so we

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:12.230 
was open he's in a curl there so we
wouldn't<00:06:11.250> want<00:06:11.310> to<00:06:11.400> throw<00:06:11.550> him<00:06:11.789> but<00:06:11.880> everyone

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:12.240 
wouldn't want to throw him but everyone

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:13.850 
wouldn't want to throw him but everyone
else<00:06:12.330> looks<00:06:12.570> to<00:06:12.659> be<00:06:12.720> matched<00:06:12.930> up<00:06:13.199> the<00:06:13.650> tight

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:13.860 
else looks to be matched up the tight

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:15.469 
else looks to be matched up the tight
end<00:06:13.979> in<00:06:14.070> the<00:06:14.099> right<00:06:14.280> slot<00:06:14.550> had<00:06:14.789> a<00:06:14.820> angle<00:06:15.210> on<00:06:15.300> his

00:06:15.469 --> 00:06:15.479 
end in the right slot had a angle on his

00:06:15.479 --> 00:06:17.000 
end in the right slot had a angle on his
man<00:06:15.630> but<00:06:15.840> the<00:06:15.900> pressure<00:06:16.110> was<00:06:16.320> so<00:06:16.470> quick<00:06:16.770> we

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:17.010 
man but the pressure was so quick we

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:18.379 
man but the pressure was so quick we
probably<00:06:17.310> didn't<00:06:17.880> really<00:06:18.030> want<00:06:18.150> to<00:06:18.180> throw

00:06:18.379 --> 00:06:18.389 
probably didn't really want to throw

00:06:18.389 --> 00:06:21.170 
probably didn't really want to throw
there<00:06:18.599> so<00:06:19.110> we're<00:06:19.229> gonna<00:06:19.320> show<00:06:19.530> this<00:06:19.650> again<00:06:20.180> but

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:21.180 
there so we're gonna show this again but

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:23.480 
there so we're gonna show this again but
we're<00:06:21.270> gonna<00:06:21.360> this<00:06:21.990> time<00:06:22.169> call<00:06:22.680> cover<00:06:22.949> three

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:23.490 
we're gonna this time call cover three

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:25.490 
we're gonna this time call cover three
so<00:06:24.300> we're<00:06:24.419> going<00:06:24.479> to<00:06:24.599> set<00:06:24.690> the<00:06:24.780> same<00:06:24.990> play<00:06:25.349> up

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:25.500 
so we're going to set the same play up

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:26.870 
so we're going to set the same play up
this<00:06:25.650> time<00:06:25.860> just<00:06:25.949> change<00:06:26.219> the<00:06:26.340> covers<00:06:26.580> behind

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:26.880 
this time just change the covers behind

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:27.830 
this time just change the covers behind
it<00:06:27.060> we're<00:06:27.150> going<00:06:27.240> to<00:06:27.300> blitz<00:06:27.510> the<00:06:27.599> middle

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:27.840 
it we're going to blitz the middle

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:29.839 
it we're going to blitz the middle
