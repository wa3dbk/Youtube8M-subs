00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:09.900
 we are in the impressive matalascañas beach in the province 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.730
 from huelva where a young fisherman or francisco ramos will show us the 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.980
 interesting way to fish 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.980
 do it three decades 

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:24.259
 they happened as a result of which you have to always see a fan there is almost no 

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:27.980
 to no means to fish or more because the villa has already sung 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:30.099
 nico has finished 

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:34.360
 and since he did not have an economic omega, he goes to a big boat, nor does he have a place or anything 

00:00:34.359 --> 00:00:37.559
 so that it adds that it helps to lower the mark returns vessel 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:41.650
 he claimed comfortable tiny but let me p p face 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:45.420
 and little by little for that, adding everything 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.090
 ocaña besides that I do not 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.639
 The CIA ordered in January 

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:52.180
 and also collaborated to minute everything 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:54.360
 the first question that is posed to us is 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.360
 because the closed pirogue has been opened 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.000
 the answer is deep in the sea 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.140
 The canoe closed are at a clear disadvantage in case of rollover or entry 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:06.000
 of water 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.650
 on the contrary open kayaks are more manageable in those cases and allow 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:14.190
 get back on them easily 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:17.350
 as if it were an inflatable mattress 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:21.890
 even more so in the case of having double helmets self does before the 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.890
 they make practically unsinkable 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:42.960
 One of the modalities that most practices francisco is hunting, it happens that 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:43.690
 before 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:47.690
 its light and quiet boat allows you to do it in places where the 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:49.360
 depth is not big 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:52.360
 and any engine or fish would take 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:02:00.310
 Attentive to the sound of the reel and the movement of the pointer will soon stop 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:02.240
 paddle and take the rod 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.240
 something has entered the employees 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:12.470
 Another advantage of open kayak is to be able to sit comfortably on the side to the 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:15.470
 pick up time 

00:02:22.249 --> 00:02:25.529
 a basic fact like this from the first catch of the morning 

00:02:25.529 --> 00:02:26.490
 its size 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:30.000
 is small for this species and francisco decided to release it 

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:37.519
 again loose thread starts up 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:40.509
 Keeping a steady rhythm is essential 

00:02:40.509 --> 00:02:43.539
 and not just so that the lures swim with a proper movement 

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:47.530
 here the key to keep a steady rhythm banón get tired 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:49.329
 said force for all 

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:51.279
 all or nothing 

00:02:51.279 --> 00:02:54.159
 vergara has 40 tops with the car and then 

00:02:54.159 --> 00:02:57.439
 spend agitated tomorrow when both can be produced applied 

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:08.649
 the areas surrounding the remains of this watchtower 

00:03:08.649 --> 00:03:12.260
 built in the 16th century to protect this coast 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:16.950
 of Berber incursions are especially interesting for some 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:21.069
 predators looking for small fish there 

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:26.099
 and other possible prey so it is not uncommon for good catches to occur 

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:33.289
 russo 

00:03:40.119 --> 00:03:41.589
 three of them 

00:03:41.589 --> 00:03:45.909
 some of good size have caught the three lures that has ridden francisco 

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:51.209
 from the same family as the lines these voracious predators usually 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:53.359
 get close enough to the coasts 

00:03:53.359 --> 00:03:56.869
 jason bay they sell this beach in a lot to a valencia 

00:03:56.869 --> 00:04:01.629
 isela tickets and economic in banks or mention in no time and always 

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:02.929
 He kept what was not 

00:04:02.929 --> 00:04:05.389
 Spain has been given the Arabic plan 

00:04:05.389 --> 00:04:08.189
 the human couple usually throw themselves 

00:04:08.189 --> 00:04:09.819
 I walk what they are 

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:15.349
 clear as a white wholly as pulpit the the swollen to the lava and the 

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:18.359
 surely orta - the serene bad that the anchovy that the food 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:21.859
 Malaga is one of them 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:27.550
 with the calm sea 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:31.789
 It is also possible to move further away from the coast in search of another type of 

00:04:31.789 --> 00:04:34.919
 pieces 

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:37.419
 francisco maintains at the same levels 

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:42.949
 which are two white vinyl pulpits and a small black and silver artificial fish 

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:45.949
 being very far from the surface 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:51.060
 To get away from the beach, it is necessary to take precautions 

00:04:51.809 --> 00:04:56.090
 In addition to the life jacket it is recommended in any circumstance 

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:59.850
 It is advisable to bring a mobile phone and inform a relative or friend of the 

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:03.379
 area you are going to go to and the approximate time of return 

00:05:05.009 --> 00:05:08.009
 It changes quickly and you have to cover any eventuality 

00:05:19.499 --> 00:05:22.029
 now it will not do anything 

00:05:22.029 --> 00:05:25.029
 the town hall leaves 

00:05:36.879 --> 00:05:39.879
 do not go 

00:05:45.249 --> 00:05:47.180
 the morning was very productive 

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:51.880
 revealing the kayak as a really interesting option when it comes to 

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:52.520
 fishing 

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:54.059
 not only to the hunt 

00:05:54.059 --> 00:05:55.289
 but also 

00:05:55.289 --> 00:05:56.200
 thoroughly 

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:59.200
 joan rangel and what not 

00:06:03.659 --> 00:06:04.129
