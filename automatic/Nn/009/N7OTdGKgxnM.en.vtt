00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 because the honoree of the gene is in the 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.250
 movie 'breakfast with diamonds' though 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.550
 this is my favorite look from the movie 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:11.370
 I find it incredibly cool with this 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.590
 man 's shirt is super modern the 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.839
 makeup the anti- facto I think it's 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.850
 fantastic I will teach you to know the 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.350
 another look since it is the most iconic yes 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.330
 I hope you like it and I think you can 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:24.240
 also as I say after hydrating the skin 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.949
 we apply the makeup base together 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.330
 with the concealer in the areas where 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.480
 it is necessary 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.130
 we started by applying a cream shadow 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:35.030
 to imitate the look he wore to audrey 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.030
 in 'breakfast with diamonds' 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.880
 although my favorite audrey look at 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.730
 this movie is when at the beginning 

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:43.590
 appears with a mask looks like a look 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.930
 very fresh and very modern for the time 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.650
 I have chosen this look because it is the most 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:52.530
 iconic 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:52.530
 now we apply a brown shadow 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:00.560
 in the area of â€‹â€‹the basin 

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:03.730
 then we apply an eyeliner 

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.730
 pretty thin 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:10.149
 sticking as much as possible to the root 

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:10.149
 of the eyelashes 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:25.340
 then we apply a colored pencil 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:25.340
 flesh in the lower part of the eye 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:33.619
 and we apply a grayish shadow 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.619
 above the eyeliner 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:38.230
 that's how I interpreted the look that 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:41.100
 takes audrey in this movie about 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:41.100
 all in some scenes 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:54.660
 we blend well 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:02.590
 since it is an eye makeup is very 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.590
 natural and very blurred 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:10.510
 and now we apply the gray shadow of 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:14.800
 Bobby Braun in the lower part of the eye 

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:14.800
 to create a depth effect 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:26.520
 we use lashes 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:33.049
 and then apply the mask 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:35.989
 I had thought about putting false eyelashes on 

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:39.260
 aura but as it has some eyelashes so 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:41.950
 long and bulky I thought not 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.950
 was necessary 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:06.270
 we also apply mask on the part 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:08.610
 lower eyelashes 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:11.930
 very carefully 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:11.930
 so as not to stain the skin 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:31.300
 Once applied we let it dry if it has 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:33.340
 dropped a little mask on the part 

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:35.739
 below and cleaned with a cotton swab 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:37.510
 of cotton this is a very useful tool 

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:40.799
 Useful 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:40.799
 to make small corrections 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:47.240
 then we apply a little bit of 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:49.990
 illuminator with a golden tone 

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:49.990
 and the cheekbones 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:54.240
 another and had fantastic cheekbones 

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:02.840
 on the tip of the nose too 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:09.239
 and a little bit of rouge is a blush 

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:09.239
 pink with a coral tone 

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:23.560
 and now one of the most 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:25.539
 important of this makeup that is 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:27.849
 recreate audrey's eyebrows that were 

00:04:25.539 --> 00:04:29.169
 quite thick though in this movie 

00:04:27.849 --> 00:04:33.210
 It was less thick than in movies 

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:33.210
 previous ones that were very bushy 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:40.980
 we are going to build them slowly 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:43.320
 making small touches 

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:45.270
 first with a shadow and then 

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:47.690
 we will apply a long eyebrow gel 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:47.690
 duration 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:55.090
 and little by little we are building 

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:59.780
 until inviting the best eyebrows 

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:59.780
 audrey 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:10.030
 this kind of eyebrow brush if you do not 

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:12.520
 you have or you do not want to buy it you can 

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:14.500
 to do in a very simple way take a 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:17.229
 eyelash mask that already serves us and 

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:18.970
 the clean well disinfects it jce and a 

00:05:17.229 --> 00:05:21.990
 Once it is dry you can use it 

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:21.990
 as eyebrow brush 

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:46.160
 now we apply make a forever gel 

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:48.890
 which is long-lasting resistant to 

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:51.220
 water to give more drama to 

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:51.220
 eyebrows 

00:05:54.680 --> 00:06:00.639
 and finally we are on the lips 

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:02.960
 applying a coral pencil first 

00:06:00.639 --> 00:06:05.690
 and then we will apply a bar 

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:08.949
 coral lips just like he was wearing audrey 

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:08.949
 for almost the entire movie 

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:41.449
 we extend the lip a little 

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:44.940
 with the pencil 

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:49.750
 and we apply a coral bar 

00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:09.580
 we apply it little by little in several layers 

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:09.580
 so that it lasts much longer 

00:07:14.139 --> 00:07:19.080
 and here we have the final result I hope 

00:07:16.659 --> 00:07:19.080
 what you liked
