00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.960 

I<00:01:53.490> think<00:01:54.240> of<00:01:54.360> it<00:01:54.450> as<00:01:54.600> just<00:01:54.630> a<00:01:55.080> massive<00:01:55.970> trash

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:56.970

truck<00:01:57.330> valet<00:02:12.590> really<00:02:13.590> working<00:02:13.920> with<00:02:14.010> the

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
worked with got in the very beginning

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:24.770

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
that the public doesn't know what they

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.720 
that the public doesn't know what they
do<00:02:24.840> and<00:02:25.650> that<00:02:25.709> they<00:02:26.040> are<00:02:26.190> underappreciated

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
and their work is often invisible and so

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.040 
and their work is often invisible and so
they<00:02:29.790> really<00:02:30.060> understood<00:02:30.480> that<00:02:30.540> this<00:02:30.750> is<00:02:30.930> a

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050
