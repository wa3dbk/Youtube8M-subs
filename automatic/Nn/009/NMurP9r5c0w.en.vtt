00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:08.139
 hello everyone I'm yemen rockies and 

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:09.580
 this new video of battlefield 4 in 

00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:11.469
 this opportunity will like how 

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:13.180
 can unlock and use the mines 

00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:15.039
 antiaircraft you already know that usually 

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:16.869
 I do not do this kind of videos of 

00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:18.760
 will show weapons or anything like this because 

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:21.130
 I usually do not know much about 

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:23.199
 the weapons but many subscribers me 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:25.089
 they asked very please to make a video 

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:27.279
 explaining these mines and how they could 

00:00:25.089 --> 00:00:28.960
 unlock and use all the main 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:30.460
 is how can you unlock them for 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:32.950
 can unlock has to complete the 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.630
 mission called death from the ground in 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:37.360
 the one that they have to get three gallons 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:39.399
 of self defense weapon and destroy 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.930
 five and cross air with the rockets 

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:43.420
 So this means that we can 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:46.480
 eliminate air vehicles with the 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:48.969
 srag with the stinger with the lilac with the 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:49.600
 rpg better said with the currents of his 

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:51.850
 preference 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:55.210
 once we get these requirements then 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:57.969
 obviously we can choose in the class 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:59.710
 engineer the anti- aircraft mines good yo 

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:01.179
 once you have selected the 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:03.010
 anti-aircraft mines the only thing that has to 

00:01:01.179 --> 00:01:05.170
 do is use them or deploy 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:07.810
 So what I advise you is that 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:09.790
 when they are going to unfold point to 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:12.280
 these mines santias to where you 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:14.290
 that air vehicles can come already 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.910
 be helicopters and airplanes does not matter 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:18.700
 whatever it is simply that they are 

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:20.560
 pointing to that side as these 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.930
 measures simply what they do is 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:25.300
 detect within a range the vehicle 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:27.250
 and start shooting the truth not 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:30.100
 It is very easy to get a death with 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.660
 these measures is rather difficult what 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.600
 only thing we have to have is a little 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:36.520
 of patience, I would also advise them 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.800
 that if they can do it with friends from 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:41.140
 soon create a strategy you 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:43.030
 have thousands of stories and have suddenly 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:44.500
 Some friend who is from the class of 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:46.330
 applaud them and do yourself the favor of 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.400
 be giving him ammunition so that you 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:51.160
 may be recharging these mines 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:53.170
 anti-aircraft here as they realize it 

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:55.360
 shot the look because they are pretty 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:57.310
 Easy to use if what you want 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.380
 do or get a death is pretty 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:01.300
 hard to shoot a mine caused a 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:03.640
 30 damage and here they are repairing 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:05.320
 helicopter but it does not repair completely 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.210
 so it shoots the second me the 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:10.330
 key if I can get death 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:13.060
 then let's say that sometimes it is 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:14.769
 matter of luck as I tell you they are 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.940
 mines very easy to use but 

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:18.370
 get a death 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:20.110
 it is quite complicated then it is 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:22.330
 where to create strategies with your friends 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:24.880
 try to have a little patience 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:26.950
 to get it and obviously have something 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:29.320
 of luck I tried to find more 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:31.570
 information obviously these mines in 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:33.550
 other videos in forums but the truth is not 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:34.900
 I got a lot of information, I think 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:37.990
 it's because it ends up being a complete 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:39.580
 crap are very useful because as they 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:41.020
 I say they are easy to use but 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:43.120
 Unfortunately when it 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:45.700
 they shoot they do a lot of damage and when 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:47.260
 they say let's shoot well and 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.360
 they go towards the goal of action 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:51.700
 helicopter some plane then at the moment 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:53.170
 of throwing the flares this one is 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:55.900
 loses the and we have to go back to 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:57.760
 reload why I tell them try to make 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:00.550
 some shingles with their friends that they 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:02.530
 are giving us ammunition or that too 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:03.990
 you can do it with two engineers and 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:06.610
 when to link and is getting closer 

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:08.830
 then one of the engineers launches a 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:10.390
 sting euroliga and in this way the 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:12.400
 aerial vehicle will deploy the 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:14.200
 flares already when you approach the mines 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.960
 well just wait to have a little 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:19.090
 of luck and being able to tell you to stay at 

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:20.770
 objective already with this simply because 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:23.650
 have the opportunity to 

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:25.780
 that the two mines reach nothing to give 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:27.310
 helicopter or plane and this way so 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:29.350
 get death so they can 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:31.060
 unlock the trophy achievement then 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:32.920
 if they asked me for this video to be able to 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:34.840
 get the achievement of the trophy I wish you 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:37.300
 good luck so you can get 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:38.980
 that death and if they simply asked me 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:40.780
 to know a little more about these 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:42.940
 mine, I hope you have served them 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:44.380
 of information this video then 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:46.390
 I hope you liked the video if 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:48.460
 well we like to leave your like favorites 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:50.290
 as labels they seem to me these 

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:52.360
 you are sanctity if you seem to them using 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:53.680
 items well subscribe to the channel if 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:55.360
 they have not yet done so hope 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.160
 that can achieve the achievement of the trophy 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:00.810
 and get many deaths with the sights 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:00.810
 find out and see you until next time 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:12.730
 look
