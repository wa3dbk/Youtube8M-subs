the the slide roll bezels on these

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.940 
the the slide roll bezels on these
things<00:01:41.430> are<00:01:41.610> always<00:01:41.759> kind<00:01:42.450> of<00:01:42.630> tight<00:01:42.950> there

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
things are always kind of tight there

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.249 
things are always kind of tight there
they're<00:01:44.340> snug<00:01:44.820> and<00:01:45.060> they<00:01:45.180> smooth<00:01:45.689> they<00:01:46.049> they

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.940 
turn smoothly but they're very stiff um
I<00:01:50.250> don't<00:01:50.579> know<00:01:50.759> how<00:01:51.259> how<00:01:52.259> often<00:01:52.590> I'd<00:01:52.649> want<00:01:52.890> to

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.010 
use it
I'd<00:01:54.149> also<00:01:54.299> worry<00:01:54.570> a<00:01:54.659> little<00:01:54.780> bit<00:01:54.899> about

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020

water<00:01:56.920> resistance<00:01:57.550> of<00:01:57.730> the<00:01:57.820> model<00:01:58.120> because

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
water resistance of the model because

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.810 
water resistance of the model because
because<00:01:59.740> of<00:01:59.860> the<00:01:59.920> way<00:02:00.040> the<00:02:00.159> side<00:02:00.370> rule<00:02:00.640> is

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:00.820 
because of the way the side rule is

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:03.840 
because of the way the side rule is
designed<00:02:01.210> on<00:02:01.600> these<00:02:02.520> the<00:02:03.520> water<00:02:03.700> resistance

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:03.850 
designed on these the water resistance

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:06.690 
designed on these the water resistance
is<00:02:04.330> only<00:02:04.479> 30<00:02:04.780> meters<00:02:05.190> not<00:02:06.190> recommended<00:02:06.670> for

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
side by side briefly here so it does

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.070 
side by side briefly here so it does
have<00:02:36.160> a<00:02:36.220> little<00:02:36.580> bit<00:02:36.700> less<00:02:37.120> presence<00:02:37.540> and<00:02:37.780> and

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:38.080 
have a little bit less presence and and

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:46.170 
have a little bit less presence and and
thickness<00:02:38.950> wise<00:02:41.190> not<00:02:42.190> quite<00:02:42.520> as<00:02:42.640> thick<00:02:45.180> but

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
thickness wise not quite as thick but

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:51.300

from<00:03:26.080> there<00:03:26.560> but<00:03:26.830> they<00:03:27.520> do<00:03:27.580> have<00:03:27.910> Yoshi<00:03:28.840> a

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:34.870 
circular really nice the date which is

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:37.199 
circular really nice the date which is
something<00:03:35.430> kind<00:03:36.430> of<00:03:36.520> cool<00:03:36.640> they<00:03:36.790> did<00:03:36.970> on<00:03:37.090> this

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:37.209 
something kind of cool they did on this

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:38.850 
something kind of cool they did on this
model<00:03:37.570> is<00:03:37.690> that<00:03:37.720> they<00:03:37.930> put<00:03:38.080> the<00:03:38.230> date<00:03:38.380> sideways

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:38.860 
model is that they put the date sideways

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:43.110 
model is that they put the date sideways
so<00:03:39.459> the<00:03:39.520> eight<00:03:39.640> shows<00:03:39.880> up<00:03:40.060> like<00:03:40.270> that<00:03:40.540> and<00:03:42.120> as

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
so the eight shows up like that and as

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.120 
so the eight shows up like that and as
you<00:03:43.300> cycle<00:03:43.630> through<00:03:43.780> the<00:03:43.900> numbers<00:03:44.230> I<00:03:44.500> can't<00:03:44.890> do

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:45.130 
you cycle through the numbers I can't do

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:46.620 
you cycle through the numbers I can't do
it<00:03:45.280> with<00:03:45.430> this<00:03:45.580> one<00:03:45.790> because<00:03:46.060> it<00:03:46.180> doesn't<00:03:46.390> have

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:46.630 
it with this one because it doesn't have

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:50.970 
it with this one because it doesn't have
a<00:03:46.660> quick<00:03:46.930> set<00:03:47.140> date<00:03:49.050> they<00:03:50.050> they<00:03:50.500> turn<00:03:50.740> the

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:57.130 
double digits they start showing up this

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:01.800 
double digits they start showing up this

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:13.030 
a 23-3 22 and it is a value movement

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:16.259 
a 23-3 22 and it is a value movement
which<00:04:13.330> is<00:04:13.510> a<00:04:13.540> which<00:04:14.350> is<00:04:14.500> the<00:04:15.269> Breitling

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:16.269 
which is a which is the Breitling

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:31.600 
the the ETA movements 28 and 92 I

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:34.260 
the the ETA movements 28 and 92 I
believe<00:04:32.340> that<00:04:33.340> some<00:04:33.520> of<00:04:33.550> the<00:04:33.669> other<00:04:33.790> ones<00:04:33.970> used

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:34.270 
believe that some of the other ones used

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:38.659 
believe that some of the other ones used
that<00:04:34.510> have<00:04:34.720> the<00:04:34.960> offset<00:04:36.690> crown<00:04:37.690> and<00:04:37.930> pushers

00:04:38.659 --> 00:04:38.669 
that have the offset crown and pushers

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:41.700 
that have the offset crown and pushers
these<00:04:39.669> ones<00:04:39.850> are<00:04:39.970> all<00:04:40.060> line<00:04:40.810> in<00:04:41.050> the<00:04:41.169> line<00:04:41.350> here

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:41.710 
these ones are all line in the line here

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:43.240 
these ones are all line in the line here
and

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:43.250 
and

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:45.730 
and
so<00:04:44.240> it<00:04:44.390> is<00:04:44.750> a<00:04:44.780> little<00:04:45.050> bit<00:04:45.200> of<00:04:45.260> a<00:04:45.320> noisier

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:45.740 
so it is a little bit of a noisier

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:49.390 
so it is a little bit of a noisier
movement<00:04:46.270> probably<00:04:47.270> can't<00:04:47.450> hear<00:04:47.690> it<00:04:47.840> but<00:04:48.400> but

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:49.400 
movement probably can't hear it but but

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:51.100 
movement probably can't hear it but but
the<00:04:49.490> value<00:04:49.790> 70<00:04:50.150> some<00:04:50.300> 50s<00:04:50.600> are<00:04:50.720> a<00:04:50.750> little<00:04:50.960> bit

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:51.110 
the value 70 some 50s are a little bit

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:55.770 
the value 70 some 50s are a little bit
more<00:04:51.140> noisy<00:04:51.680> and<00:04:52.690> but<00:04:53.690> that's<00:04:53.780> that's<00:04:54.080> fine

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:55.780 
more noisy and but that's that's fine

00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:02.320 
more noisy and but that's that's fine
not<00:04:56.780> not<00:04:57.350> a<00:04:57.380> huge<00:04:57.710> deal<00:04:58.430> to<00:04:58.460> me<00:04:59.320> and<00:05:01.120> has<00:05:02.120> the
