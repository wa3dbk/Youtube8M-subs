00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
of the onions and rituals where we've

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.910 
of the onions and rituals where we've
put<00:00:23.910> in<00:00:24.090> make<00:00:25.050> sure<00:00:25.080> when<00:00:25.410> you<00:00:25.500> buy<00:00:25.650> a<00:00:25.680> chicken

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
put in make sure when you buy a chicken

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.929 
put in make sure when you buy a chicken
you<00:00:26.789> like<00:00:27.859> make<00:00:28.859> sure<00:00:29.039> it's<00:00:29.220> not<00:00:29.279> too<00:00:29.460> because

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
you like make sure it's not too because

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.460 
you like make sure it's not too because
obviously<00:00:30.240> the<00:00:30.539> slow<00:00:30.720> cookers<00:00:31.080> aren't<00:00:31.410> that

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
obviously the slow cookers aren't that

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.280 
obviously the slow cookers aren't that
big<00:00:31.740> really<00:00:32.460> to<00:00:32.790> hold<00:00:33.000> a<00:00:33.120> huge<00:00:33.390> chicken<00:00:33.600> so<00:00:34.050> I

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
big really to hold a huge chicken so I

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.250 
big really to hold a huge chicken so I
think<00:00:34.890> this<00:00:35.130> is<00:00:35.190> probably<00:00:35.790> about<00:00:35.940> a<00:00:36.059> 1.2<00:00:36.870> to

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
think this is probably about a 1.2 to

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.549 
think this is probably about a 1.2 to
1.4<00:00:37.440> kilograms<00:00:38.930> so<00:00:39.930> yeah<00:00:40.079> once<00:00:40.260> you<00:00:40.379> put<00:00:40.530> your

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
1.4 kilograms so yeah once you put your

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:41.959 
1.4 kilograms so yeah once you put your
chicken<00:00:40.770> in<00:00:40.920> there<00:00:41.070> all<00:00:41.219> you<00:00:41.309> need<00:00:41.489> to<00:00:41.640> do<00:00:41.760> now

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
chicken in there all you need to do now

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.150 
chicken in there all you need to do now
