realflow<00:00:07.670> workflow<00:00:08.670> in<00:00:08.970> am<00:00:09.360> I<00:00:10.700> just<00:00:11.700> gonna<00:00:11.820> do

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
realflow workflow in am I just gonna do

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.930 
realflow workflow in am I just gonna do
basically<00:00:12.420> just<00:00:13.259> a<00:00:13.410> cup<00:00:16.369> cup<00:00:17.369> pretty<00:00:17.730> much

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
basically just a cup cup pretty much

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:23.570 
basically just a cup cup pretty much
filled<00:00:18.449> with<00:00:19.010> water<00:00:20.010> and<00:00:20.930> how<00:00:21.930> it<00:00:22.109> is<00:00:22.580> worked

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
filled with water and how it is worked

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.410 
filled with water and how it is worked
out<00:00:23.760> in<00:00:24.600> real<00:00:25.080> fluff<00:00:25.350> there's<00:00:26.160> real<00:00:26.310> flow<00:00:26.580> just

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
out in real fluff there's real flow just

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.359 
out in real fluff there's real flow just
basically<00:00:27.869> got<00:00:28.199> our<00:00:28.289> social<00:00:28.590> cut<00:00:28.740> mesh<00:00:29.039> that

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
basically got our social cut mesh that

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.020 
basically got our social cut mesh that
you<00:00:29.550> can<00:00:29.730> either<00:00:30.060> build<00:00:30.269> in<00:00:30.890> Maya<00:00:31.890> or<00:00:32.219> rail

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
you can either build in Maya or rail

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.180 
you can either build in Maya or rail
flow<00:00:34.070> and<00:00:35.070> then<00:00:35.250> you<00:00:35.370> go<00:00:35.520> ahead<00:00:35.640> and<00:00:35.760> you<00:00:35.940> just

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:37.190 
flow and then you go ahead and you just

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:40.069 
flow and then you go ahead and you just
get<00:00:38.190> your<00:00:38.370> scene<00:00:38.820> set<00:00:39.030> up<00:00:39.120> with<00:00:39.300> as<00:00:39.540> far<00:00:39.899> as

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
get your scene set up with as far as

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.130 
get your scene set up with as far as
assimilating<00:00:41.070> and<00:00:41.910> basically<00:00:42.420> it's<00:00:42.629> a<00:00:42.719> circle

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
assimilating and basically it's a circle

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.260 
assimilating and basically it's a circle
so<00:00:43.559> I've<00:00:43.710> got<00:00:43.829> a<00:00:43.860> circle<00:00:44.340> and<00:00:44.579> then<00:00:44.789> you<00:00:44.969> get

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
so I've got a circle and then you get

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.150 
so I've got a circle and then you get
your

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:49.160 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.670 

you<00:00:50.150> get<00:00:50.300> your<00:00:50.540> resolutions<00:00:51.380> the<00:00:51.530> way<00:00:51.620> you

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:51.680 
you get your resolutions the way you

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:55.510 
you get your resolutions the way you
want<00:00:51.920> it<00:00:52.010> and<00:00:52.570> how<00:00:53.570> many<00:00:53.800> particles<00:00:54.800> that<00:00:55.340> you

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:55.520 
want it and how many particles that you

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.280 
want it and how many particles that you
need<00:00:55.700> so<00:00:56.210> I'm<00:00:56.270> just<00:00:56.450> setting<00:00:56.630> up<00:00:56.750> a<00:00:56.870> scene<00:00:57.050> is

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:57.290 
need so I'm just setting up a scene is

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:59.200 
need so I'm just setting up a scene is
to<00:00:57.559> get<00:00:58.010> the<00:00:58.160> flow<00:00:58.370> to<00:00:58.430> go<00:00:58.700> the<00:00:58.790> way<00:00:58.879> I<00:00:58.910> like<00:00:59.180> it

00:00:59.200 --> 00:00:59.210 
to get the flow to go the way I like it

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:01.330 
to get the flow to go the way I like it
too<00:00:59.480> because<00:01:00.020> as<00:01:00.200> you<00:01:00.350> see<00:01:00.500> the<00:01:00.620> splashing<00:01:01.160> on

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:01.340 
too because as you see the splashing on

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:04.420 
too because as you see the splashing on
the<00:01:01.430> right<00:01:01.580> and<00:01:01.820> left<00:01:02.260> so<00:01:03.260> then<00:01:03.470> that's<00:01:03.680> saved

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:04.430 
the right and left so then that's saved

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:07.450 
the right and left so then that's saved
and<00:01:04.760> we<00:01:04.879> export<00:01:05.390> it<00:01:05.479> out<00:01:05.630> into<00:01:06.260> an<00:01:06.440> SD<00:01:06.890> file<00:01:07.160> and

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:07.460 
and we export it out into an SD file and

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.250 
and we export it out into an SD file and
go<00:01:08.180> and<00:01:08.330> search<00:01:08.540> for<00:01:08.570> that<00:01:08.960> here<00:01:09.470> in<00:01:09.650> Maya<00:01:10.220> and

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:11.260 
go and search for that here in Maya and

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:15.300 
go and search for that here in Maya and
then<00:01:12.260> it's<00:01:12.530> under<00:01:12.770> mesh<00:01:13.100> to<00:01:13.550> be<00:01:13.610> the<00:01:13.729> bin<00:01:13.880> file

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:15.310 
then it's under mesh to be the bin file

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:18.400 
then it's under mesh to be the bin file
let<00:01:16.310> me<00:01:16.369> get<00:01:16.550> i'm<00:01:16.820> getting<00:01:17.060> the<00:01:17.390> cup<00:01:17.780> first<00:01:18.050> and

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:18.410 
let me get i'm getting the cup first and

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:21.280 
let me get i'm getting the cup first and
then<00:01:18.680> that's<00:01:19.040> the<00:01:19.250> SD<00:01:19.550> file<00:01:19.790> and<00:01:20.119> under<00:01:21.080> on

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:21.290 
then that's the SD file and under on

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:23.620 
then that's the SD file and under on
your<00:01:21.530> menu<00:01:21.710> would<00:01:21.979> be<00:01:22.220> netflix<00:01:23.030> you<00:01:23.270> could<00:01:23.450> get

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:23.630 
your menu would be netflix you could get

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:27.580 
your menu would be netflix you could get
to<00:01:23.990> your<00:01:24.220> michigan<00:01:25.220> porter<00:01:25.640> and<00:01:26.180> you<00:01:27.110> can<00:01:27.320> get

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:27.590 
to your michigan porter and you can get

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:31.620 
to your michigan porter and you can get
your<00:01:27.740> SD<00:01:28.039> file<00:01:28.280> and<00:01:28.550> there<00:01:28.759> it<00:01:28.880> is<00:01:29.000> there

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:31.630 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:33.999 

basically<00:01:32.630> the<00:01:32.840> procedure<00:01:33.170> it<00:01:33.380> goes<00:01:33.560> down<00:01:33.860> you

00:01:33.999 --> 00:01:34.009 
basically the procedure it goes down you

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:36.850 
basically the procedure it goes down you
need<00:01:34.160> to<00:01:34.250> get<00:01:34.399> your<00:01:34.550> shaders<00:01:34.940> and<00:01:35.680> from<00:01:36.680> there

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:36.860 
need to get your shaders and from there

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:40.480 
need to get your shaders and from there
but<00:01:37.240> we<00:01:38.240> also<00:01:38.420> need<00:01:38.660> to<00:01:38.780> get<00:01:38.930> a<00:01:38.960> scene<00:01:39.350> lit<00:01:39.830> HDR

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490 
but we also need to get a scene lit HDR

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:42.580 
but we also need to get a scene lit HDR
is<00:01:40.610> really<00:01:40.820> good<00:01:41.060> at<00:01:41.390> that<00:01:41.720> or<00:01:42.080> just<00:01:42.320> in<00:01:42.500> a

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:42.590 
is really good at that or just in a

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.730 
is really good at that or just in a
plane<00:01:42.950> incandescent<00:01:43.910> light<00:01:44.509> or<00:01:44.840> spotlight

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 
plane incandescent light or spotlight

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.359 
plane incandescent light or spotlight
will<00:01:46.070> work<00:01:46.840> this<00:01:47.840> is<00:01:48.020> something<00:01:48.530> kind<00:01:48.860> of<00:01:49.039> just

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:49.369 
will work this is something kind of just

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:51.570 
will work this is something kind of just
thrown<00:01:49.580> together<00:01:49.729> here<00:01:50.180> for<00:01:50.420> us<00:01:50.539> here<00:01:50.840> at<00:01:50.960> down

thrown together here for us here at down

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:54.219 
thrown together here for us here at down
in<00:01:52.580> one<00:01:52.729> of<00:01:52.759> our<00:01:52.850> projects<00:01:53.300> but<00:01:53.509> i'm<00:01:53.990> going<00:01:54.170> to

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:54.229 
in one of our projects but i'm going to

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:59.589 
in one of our projects but i'm going to
just<00:01:54.349> get<00:01:54.500> an<00:01:54.590> image<00:01:54.740> map<00:01:55.459> down<00:01:55.700> here<00:01:57.759> okay<00:01:58.759> now

00:01:59.589 --> 00:01:59.599 
just get an image map down here okay now

00:01:59.599 --> 00:02:03.820 
just get an image map down here okay now
we<00:01:59.660> just<00:02:00.020> got<00:02:00.170> to<00:02:00.200> last<00:02:02.080> would<00:02:03.080> be<00:02:03.229> what<00:02:03.800> I

we just got to last would be what I

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:06.490 
we just got to last would be what I
would<00:02:03.920> use<00:02:04.399> to<00:02:05.060> simulate<00:02:05.479> my<00:02:05.840> water<00:02:06.110> and<00:02:06.349> there

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:06.500 
would use to simulate my water and there

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.690 
would use to simulate my water and there
it<00:02:06.619> is<00:02:06.679> and<00:02:06.890> i<00:02:06.950> just<00:02:07.130> select<00:02:07.819> and<00:02:08.500> assign<00:02:09.700> to

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700 
it is and i just select and assign to

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:12.490 
it is and i just select and assign to
the<00:02:10.910> shader<00:02:11.209> which<00:02:11.360> be<00:02:11.780> into<00:02:11.990> your<00:02:12.110> shaded

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
the shader which be into your shaded

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.520 
the shader which be into your shaded
tree<00:02:12.590> library<00:02:13.150> installed<00:02:14.150> into<00:02:14.510> your<00:02:14.900> hard

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
tree library installed into your hard

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:17.300 
tree library installed into your hard
drive

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
drive

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.290 
drive
and<00:02:17.880> there<00:02:18.510> we<00:02:18.840> go<00:02:19.050> okay<00:02:19.890> so<00:02:19.950> now<00:02:20.370> i<00:02:20.700> have<00:02:21.270> my

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
and there we go okay so now i have my

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.600 
and there we go okay so now i have my
plane<00:02:21.810> to<00:02:22.050> have<00:02:22.290> my<00:02:22.739> mesh<00:02:23.459> from<00:02:24.360> realflow<00:02:25.080> and

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
plane to have my mesh from realflow and

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:28.309 
plane to have my mesh from realflow and
I'm<00:02:26.610> just<00:02:26.940> kind<00:02:27.270> of<00:02:27.300> thinking<00:02:27.510> Cambridge

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:28.319 
I'm just kind of thinking Cambridge

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:31.100 
I'm just kind of thinking Cambridge
splitting<00:02:28.980> image<00:02:29.190> on<00:02:29.640> this<00:02:30.000> plane<00:02:30.420> would<00:02:30.900> make

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
splitting image on this plane would make

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:35.750 
splitting image on this plane would make
it<00:02:31.290> to<00:02:31.470> reflect<00:02:32.370> the<00:02:32.760> light<00:02:33.660> in<00:02:34.019> the<00:02:34.610> image<00:02:35.610> a

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
it to reflect the light in the image a

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.610 
it to reflect the light in the image a
little<00:02:36.000> bit<00:02:36.090> more<00:02:36.269> better<00:02:36.510> show<00:02:36.810> that's<00:02:37.290> what

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
little bit more better show that's what

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.370 
little bit more better show that's what
I'm<00:02:37.739> doing<00:02:37.769> am<00:02:38.370> I<00:02:39.000> by<00:02:39.180> default<00:02:39.630> pleasure

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
I'm doing am I by default pleasure

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:43.820 
I'm doing am I by default pleasure
images<00:02:40.830> so<00:02:41.220> he<00:02:41.970> sits<00:02:42.319> some<00:02:43.319> of<00:02:43.380> the<00:02:43.440> standards

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
images so he sits some of the standards

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:45.680 
images so he sits some of the standards
this<00:02:44.130> is<00:02:44.310> all<00:02:44.489> basic<00:02:44.970> stuff<00:02:45.180> that<00:02:45.330> you<00:02:45.510> would

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
this is all basic stuff that you would

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.949 
this is all basic stuff that you would
get<00:02:45.900> in<00:02:46.110> the<00:02:46.590> intro<00:02:46.830> tamiya<00:02:47.780> we're<00:02:48.780> going<00:02:48.900> to

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
get in the intro tamiya we're going to

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:51.020 
get in the intro tamiya we're going to
go<00:02:49.080> over<00:02:49.110> all<00:02:49.319> that<00:02:49.350> but<00:02:49.769> basically<00:02:50.670> we<00:02:50.940> want

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
go over all that but basically we want

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:55.100 
go over all that but basically we want
onlar<00:02:51.480> it<00:02:51.660> and<00:02:51.930> get<00:02:52.830> it<00:02:52.860> all<00:02:53.010> set<00:02:53.340> up<00:02:53.370> for<00:02:54.110> and

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
onlar it and get it all set up for and

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
onlar it and get it all set up for and
how<00:02:55.739> did<00:02:55.950> i<00:02:55.980> make<00:02:57.410> reflection<00:02:58.410> off<00:02:58.590> of<00:02:58.620> there

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
how did i make reflection off of there

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:02.150 
how did i make reflection off of there
water<00:02:59.640> in<00:03:00.030> our<00:03:00.299> glass<00:03:00.709> but<00:03:01.709> I<00:03:01.769> hit<00:03:01.890> the<00:03:01.980> glass

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
water in our glass but I hit the glass

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.140 
water in our glass but I hit the glass
because<00:03:02.610> I'm<00:03:03.060> not<00:03:03.209> going<00:03:03.390> to<00:03:03.450> get<00:03:03.569> into<00:03:05.150> you

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
because I'm not going to get into you

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:07.610 
because I'm not going to get into you
know<00:03:06.239> a<00:03:06.269> cup<00:03:06.569> full<00:03:06.720> of<00:03:06.780> water<00:03:06.900> I<00:03:07.170> just<00:03:07.230> wanted

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
know a cup full of water I just wanted

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:11.240 
know a cup full of water I just wanted
to<00:03:07.650> see<00:03:07.980> how<00:03:08.310> the<00:03:08.370> actual<00:03:09.739> shader<00:03:10.739> network

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
to see how the actual shader network

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:15.140 
to see how the actual shader network
would<00:03:11.489> work<00:03:11.730> with<00:03:12.239> real<00:03:12.450> flow<00:03:12.690> and<00:03:13.400> in<00:03:14.400> my

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
would work with real flow and in my

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.630 
would work with real flow and in my
Deanna

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
Deanna

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.210 
Deanna
meaning<00:03:18.420> that<00:03:18.569> the<00:03:18.840> shader<00:03:19.140> that<00:03:19.410> I<00:03:19.440> assigning

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
meaning that the shader that I assigning

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:24.280 
meaning that the shader that I assigning
in<00:03:20.340> Maya<00:03:20.580> is<00:03:21.300> put<00:03:21.630> on<00:03:22.130> the<00:03:23.130> mess<00:03:23.340> that<00:03:23.610> was

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:24.290 
in Maya is put on the mess that was

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:27.949 
in Maya is put on the mess that was
simulated<00:03:25.290> out<00:03:25.440> of<00:03:25.650> real<00:03:25.920> flow<00:03:26.220> and<00:03:26.810> there<00:03:27.810> i'm

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959 
simulated out of real flow and there i'm

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:31.190 
simulated out of real flow and there i'm
pretty<00:03:28.319> happy<00:03:28.410> with<00:03:29.240> that<00:03:30.240> particular<00:03:30.630> image

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 
pretty happy with that particular image

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:36.080 
pretty happy with that particular image
so<00:03:31.890> now<00:03:32.790> i'm<00:03:33.030> just<00:03:33.680> that<00:03:34.680> set<00:03:35.520> my<00:03:35.700> scene<00:03:35.940> in

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
so now i'm just that set my scene in

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:38.930 
so now i'm just that set my scene in
maya<00:03:36.270> to<00:03:36.750> be<00:03:37.380> there<00:03:37.620> the<00:03:37.890> frames<00:03:38.190> that<00:03:38.550> real

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
maya to be there the frames that real

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:43.030 
maya to be there the frames that real
flow<00:03:39.180> has<00:03:40.610> gave<00:03:41.610> us<00:03:41.880> a<00:03:41.910> solution<00:03:42.180> and

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:43.040 
flow has gave us a solution and

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:45.590 
flow has gave us a solution and
therefore<00:03:44.040> now<00:03:44.310> i'm<00:03:44.370> just<00:03:44.850> making<00:03:45.239> sure<00:03:45.420> that

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:45.600 
therefore now i'm just making sure that

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.330 
therefore now i'm just making sure that
everything<00:03:46.110> is<00:03:46.140> lining<00:03:46.500> up<00:03:46.800> straightening<00:03:47.220> up

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
everything is lining up straightening up

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:52.160 
everything is lining up straightening up
my<00:03:47.370> image<00:03:47.700> plane<00:03:47.940> a<00:03:47.970> little<00:03:48.300> bit<00:03:50.750> so<00:03:51.750> i<00:03:51.810> get<00:03:52.020> my

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170 
my image plane a little bit so i get my

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:54.770 
my image plane a little bit so i get my
final<00:03:52.500> shot<00:03:52.850> they<00:03:53.850> come<00:03:54.030> out<00:03:54.180> to<00:03:54.270> kind<00:03:54.420> of<00:03:54.570> a

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
final shot they come out to kind of a

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:57.620 
final shot they come out to kind of a
final<00:03:55.080> sequence<00:03:55.470> actually<00:03:56.040> sitting<00:03:56.670> up<00:03:56.850> my

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:57.630 
final sequence actually sitting up my

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:59.840 
final sequence actually sitting up my
renders<00:03:58.010> you<00:03:59.010> know<00:03:59.100> you<00:03:59.190> can<00:03:59.310> also<00:03:59.430> set<00:03:59.700> your

00:03:59.840 --> 00:03:59.850 
renders you know you can also set your

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:01.699 
renders you know you can also set your
render<00:04:00.150> just<00:04:00.480> to<00:04:00.630> be<00:04:00.720> as<00:04:00.840> default<00:04:01.320> if<00:04:01.470> you<00:04:01.560> just

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:01.709 
render just to be as default if you just

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:05.930 
render just to be as default if you just
want<00:04:01.860> to<00:04:01.980> see<00:04:02.160> this<00:04:02.370> but<00:04:02.780> to<00:04:03.780> actually<00:04:03.870> get<00:04:04.940> get

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:05.940 
want to see this but to actually get get

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:08.000 
want to see this but to actually get get
ray<00:04:06.360> tracing<00:04:06.600> use<00:04:06.989> mental<00:04:07.260> ray<00:04:07.410> you<00:04:07.680> could<00:04:07.860> use

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.010 
ray tracing use mental ray you could use

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:12.080 
ray tracing use mental ray you could use
any<00:04:08.550> other<00:04:08.760> will<00:04:09.330> do<00:04:09.450> just<00:04:09.900> fine<00:04:11.090> actually

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.090 
any other will do just fine actually

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:14.120 
any other will do just fine actually
I've<00:04:12.180> tried<00:04:12.390> all<00:04:12.420> of<00:04:12.600> them<00:04:12.840> and<00:04:12.989> I<00:04:13.260> think<00:04:13.800> they

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:14.130 
I've tried all of them and I think they

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:17.960 
I've tried all of them and I think they
are<00:04:14.340> pretty<00:04:15.030> good<00:04:15.890> okay<00:04:16.890> so<00:04:17.250> here<00:04:17.820> we<00:04:17.940> go

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:17.970 
are pretty good okay so here we go

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:20.599 
are pretty good okay so here we go
inside<00:04:18.239> our<00:04:18.540> final<00:04:19.109> render

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:20.609 
inside our final render

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:24.050 
inside our final render
atwater<00:04:21.000> salvation<00:04:21.840> there<00:04:22.019> and<00:04:22.729> looks<00:04:23.729> pretty

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.060 
atwater salvation there and looks pretty

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:26.119 
atwater salvation there and looks pretty
good<00:04:24.270> i<00:04:24.300> thought<00:04:24.599> that<00:04:24.870> i<00:04:24.930> came<00:04:25.289> across<00:04:25.439> pretty

00:04:26.119 --> 00:04:26.129 
good i thought that i came across pretty

00:04:26.129 --> 00:04:29.390 
good i thought that i came across pretty
pretty<00:04:26.819> nice<00:04:27.090> in<00:04:27.449> there<00:04:28.009> this<00:04:29.009> is<00:04:29.159> just<00:04:29.310> a

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:29.400 
pretty nice in there this is just a

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:33.200 
pretty nice in there this is just a
little<00:04:29.639> glimpse<00:04:29.729> into<00:04:30.180> how<00:04:31.310> my<00:04:32.310> in<00:04:32.759> realflow

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:33.210 
little glimpse into how my in realflow

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:36.409 
little glimpse into how my in realflow
worked<00:04:33.870> out<00:04:34.050> together<00:04:34.289> because<00:04:35.039> a<00:04:35.430> lot<00:04:36.270> people

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:36.419 
worked out together because a lot people

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:39.050 
worked out together because a lot people
ask<00:04:36.750> me<00:04:37.039> there's<00:04:38.039> different<00:04:38.340> people<00:04:38.939> of

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:39.060 
ask me there's different people of

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:42.020 
ask me there's different people of
else'll<00:04:39.479> that<00:04:39.689> my<00:04:39.870> friends<00:04:40.530> here<00:04:40.740> that<00:04:41.030> have

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:42.030
