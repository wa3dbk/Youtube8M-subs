 sixteenth century on this earth was 

00:00:02.379 --> 00:00:04.420
 Cyril was erected in Ozersk monasteries 

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:05.820
 which lasted until 

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:07.259
 October Revolution 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:09.710

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:11.740
 first political prisoners concluded 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:12.940
 and after the Great Patriotic War 

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:15.210
 here those who collaborated with 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.300
 Hitler regime after the Khrushchev thaw 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:19.430
 political theme transformed into 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:21.169
 colony special regime a two years 

00:00:21.169 --> 00:00:23.279
 back as an experiment of them 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:24.800
 made prison for life 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.340
 prisoners today is the only one in 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:29.259
 Russian prison of this kind 

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:31.399
 now the colony is 127 prisoners 

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:33.120
 sentenced to death 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.030
 then pardoned commission when 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:36.890
 the president of russia only two 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:38.789
 convicts over sixty years old 

00:00:38.789 --> 00:00:41.539
 the rest is less than 40 hectares average age 

00:00:41.539 --> 00:00:44.739
 is 28 35 years basic 

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:46.210
 firing articles for which convicted 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:47.050
 these people 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:48.969
 more than three murders for each robbery 

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:50.559
 banditry and violence 

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:52.370
 on the fire sit people who 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:54.159
 put yourself out of morality or not 

00:00:54.159 --> 00:00:55.010
 society 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:58.010
 two people killed however 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:02.130
 and the second moment can free 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.180
 mean nothing with one more movement 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:10.640
 sense of punishment is loneliness 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:12.640
 or as the condemned deaths say 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:14.100
 deferred installments 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.140
 condition caused by the lack of what 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.000
 there is no radio TV information 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:19.660
 and newspapers 

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:21.640
 two thousand books and a serial hybrid these 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.420
 old-timers have already learned by heart 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.650
 most of the literature making up 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.650
 detective fiction and romance novels 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:29.120
 apart from his cellmate 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:31.510
 convicts are forbidden to communicate with anyone 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:34.590
 even with gentlemen and warders at all 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.650
 no mention of forgiveness 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:38.290
 Russia under the contract 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:40.370
 so the conclusion 

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:41.980
 it turns out 

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:44.030
 all engineering networks 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:45.270
 lifelong cameras 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.100
 the convict is twos 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.720
 also the two work four hours a little 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:51.830
 there are enough salary mitts to 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:53.920
 buy tobacco in plenty 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.250
 will push the main dream in the zone 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.420
 four times a month in prisoners baths 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:00.670
 also once ten days spend on 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:01.490
 a walk 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:03.840
 in fact, suicide bombers also walk in the cell 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.939
 then this place is often steel ceilings 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:06.860
 twigs 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:09.039
 convict before going for a walk 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:11.430
 searched after this comes 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.190
 handcuffed to prevent attack 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:14.460
 on convoy you and prevent 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:15.780
 suicide attempts 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:16.999
 just a month 

00:02:16.999 --> 00:02:18.779
 because the suicide bomber did not refuse 

00:02:18.779 --> 00:02:20.589
 relatives are allowed to receive 

00:02:20.589 --> 00:02:22.999
 eight kilogram parcels dating themselves 

00:02:22.999 --> 00:02:24.619
 with relatives forbidden 

00:02:24.619 --> 00:02:27.249
 Glory to Russia and below 

00:02:27.249 --> 00:02:30.599
 woke up it's impossible to cure 

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:32.930
 deputies themselves were in their very 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:34.609
 China 

00:02:34.609 --> 00:02:36.589
 Russia r 

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:38.429
 in place 

00:02:38.429 --> 00:02:39.959
 I just arrived in the colony 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:42.239
 prisoners often go into hysterics 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:44.090
 then deep depression 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.040
 According to Kiryanov psychologist Vladimir 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.680
 popova 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.409
 only here and not aware 

00:02:48.409 --> 00:02:50.189
 what can give and ahead 

00:02:50.189 --> 00:02:52.479
 I thought 

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:54.699
 this can confirm bosses 

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:57.569
 I'm never right in my life 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:00.449
 the second one wept not for us 

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:02.329
 explains it 

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:05.149
 according to the results of gurvich lats 

00:03:05.149 --> 00:03:07.519
 many convicts canâ€™t survive 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:08.980
 and attempt suicide 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.400
 tie forward swallow the bose 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.389
 lost cemetery last year 

00:03:13.389 --> 00:03:15.249
 two fresh graves appeared 

00:03:15.249 --> 00:03:17.669
 there are no gravestones of crosses on them even 

00:03:17.669 --> 00:03:18.559
 named 

00:03:18.559 --> 00:03:20.639
 only wooden plate with ordinal 

00:03:20.639 --> 00:03:21.529
 number 

00:03:21.529 --> 00:03:23.259
 according to an attempt to commit suicide 

00:03:23.259 --> 00:03:25.749
 undertaking those who did not ask for 

00:03:25.749 --> 00:03:28.409
 pardon and their life in prison is not 

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:29.639
 so little 

00:03:29.639 --> 00:03:30.880
 this is a pantry 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:33.989
 interesting section 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:36.989
 I was near the body 

00:03:37.559 --> 00:03:39.249
 burning for life 

00:03:39.249 --> 00:03:40.849
 these are people 

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:43.369
 most people are unconscious 

00:03:43.369 --> 00:03:45.879
 so we must pay tribute 

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:49.029
 remarkable withdrawal decision was made 

00:03:49.029 --> 00:03:50.179
 based 

00:03:50.179 --> 00:03:53.009
 but my grandmother Leonova 

00:03:53.009 --> 00:03:55.149
 the rest grows like mushrooms 

00:03:55.149 --> 00:03:56.999
 but it turns out today for such 

00:03:56.999 --> 00:03:58.449
 no legal approach 

00:03:58.449 --> 00:03:59.609
 grounds 

00:03:59.609 --> 00:04:01.089
 right to demand 

00:04:01.089 --> 00:04:02.719
 what would you change 

00:04:02.719 --> 00:04:04.609
 last 

00:04:04.609 --> 00:04:07.439
 the conclusions of the death penalty not less 

00:04:07.439 --> 00:04:10.439
 only 

00:04:11.189 --> 00:04:13.469
 to dispose of their lives themselves 

00:04:13.469 --> 00:04:15.569
 but demand it from the state of course 

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:16.969
 can't convinced 

00:04:16.969 --> 00:04:18.859
 Today, Russia will enter the Council of Europe 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:21.340
 facing the problem of the abolition of the death penalty 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:22.639
 lifelong unity 

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:22.819
 the conclusions
