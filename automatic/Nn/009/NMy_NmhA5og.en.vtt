vr6 purists that are out there I feel

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:37.830 
vr6 purists that are out there I feel
like<00:00:35.320> they're<00:00:36.250> going<00:00:36.430> to<00:00:36.490> miss<00:00:36.670> the<00:00:37.000> old<00:00:37.270> v6

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:39.760 
with reality is I've driven every

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:42.510 
with reality is I've driven every
generation<00:00:40.210> of<00:00:40.710> our<00:00:41.710> model<00:00:42.040> that's<00:00:42.190> been<00:00:42.400> out

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:42.520 
generation of our model that's been out

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:45.090 
generation of our model that's been out
so<00:00:42.760> far<00:00:43.000> and<00:00:43.660> this<00:00:43.870> is<00:00:44.050> by<00:00:44.200> far<00:00:44.410> the<00:00:44.470> liveliest

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:45.100 
so far and this is by far the liveliest

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:47.160 
so far and this is by far the liveliest
version<00:00:45.670> there's<00:00:46.059> nothing<00:00:46.630> against<00:00:46.930> the<00:00:47.020> old

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:47.170 
version there's nothing against the old

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:49.560 
version there's nothing against the old
vr6<00:00:47.620> version<00:00:47.980> it<00:00:48.070> was<00:00:48.160> a<00:00:48.190> fantastic<00:00:48.580> car<00:00:49.030> the

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:49.570 
vr6 version it was a fantastic car the

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:51.360 
vr6 version it was a fantastic car the
v6<00:00:49.750> had<00:00:50.110> a<00:00:50.140> great<00:00:50.350> sound<00:00:50.680> to<00:00:50.800> it<00:00:51.070> but<00:00:51.250> I<00:00:51.280> think

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:51.370 
v6 had a great sound to it but I think

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:53.100 
v6 had a great sound to it but I think
the<00:00:51.610> engineers<00:00:52.000> have<00:00:52.210> done<00:00:52.330> a<00:00:52.390> fantastic<00:00:52.660> job

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:53.110 
the engineers have done a fantastic job

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:56.240 
the engineers have done a fantastic job
of<00:00:53.680> lowering<00:00:54.460> the<00:00:54.610> overall<00:00:55.000> weight

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
of lowering the overall weight

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.350 
of lowering the overall weight
especially<00:00:57.250> up<00:00:57.370> front<00:00:57.670> over<00:00:58.059> the<00:00:58.150> front

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:58.360 
especially up front over the front

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:59.820 
especially up front over the front
wheels<00:00:58.600> and<00:00:58.900> that's<00:00:59.050> so<00:00:59.230> critical<00:00:59.260> when

00:00:59.820 --> 00:00:59.830 
wheels and that's so critical when

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:01.590 
wheels and that's so critical when
you're<00:01:00.040> trying<00:01:00.339> to<00:01:00.519> get<00:01:00.850> the<00:01:01.089> best<00:01:01.300> handling

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:01.600 
you're trying to get the best handling

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:09.300 
you're trying to get the best handling
that<00:01:02.110> you<00:01:02.290> can<00:01:02.470> out<00:01:02.710> of<00:01:02.739> the<00:01:02.890> vehicle<00:01:08.310> the

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:09.310 
that you can out of the vehicle the

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:11.130 
that you can out of the vehicle the
all-wheel<00:01:09.610> drive<00:01:09.909> actually<00:01:10.480> makes<00:01:10.720> this<00:01:10.840> car

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:11.140 
all-wheel drive actually makes this car

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:12.360 
all-wheel drive actually makes this car
a<00:01:11.170> little<00:01:11.470> more<00:01:11.620> neutral<00:01:12.040> where<00:01:12.220> it's

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:12.370 
a little more neutral where it's

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:13.920 
a little more neutral where it's
front-wheel<00:01:12.610> drive<00:01:12.730> cars<00:01:13.210> at<00:01:13.420> their<00:01:13.570> limits

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:13.930 
front-wheel drive cars at their limits

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:16.890 
front-wheel drive cars at their limits
tend<00:01:14.560> to<00:01:14.680> push<00:01:14.890> and<00:01:15.310> understeer<00:01:15.730> this<00:01:16.360> car<00:01:16.600> has

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:16.900 
tend to push and understeer this car has

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:19.440 
tend to push and understeer this car has
more<00:01:17.320> of<00:01:17.440> a<00:01:17.500> tendency<00:01:17.710> to<00:01:18.190> turn<00:01:18.370> in<00:01:18.640> and<00:01:19.270> when

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:19.450 
more of a tendency to turn in and when

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:20.850 
more of a tendency to turn in and when
you<00:01:19.570> hammer<00:01:19.840> on<00:01:20.050> the<00:01:20.170> accelerator<00:01:20.680> because

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:20.860 
you hammer on the accelerator because

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:22.890 
you hammer on the accelerator because
they<00:01:21.130> all<00:01:21.220> wheel<00:01:21.340> drive<00:01:21.430> it<00:01:22.120> just<00:01:22.390> pulls<00:01:22.690> that

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:22.900 
they all wheel drive it just pulls that

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:24.780 
they all wheel drive it just pulls that
car<00:01:23.140> right<00:01:23.500> through<00:01:23.710> the<00:01:23.800> corner<00:01:24.100> I<00:01:24.340> mean<00:01:24.580> all

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:24.790 
car right through the corner I mean all

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:26.340 
car right through the corner I mean all
that<00:01:24.970> power<00:01:25.120> is<00:01:25.270> going<00:01:25.450> right<00:01:25.630> down<00:01:25.870> all<00:01:26.110> four

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:26.350 
that power is going right down all four

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:28.140 
that power is going right down all four
wheels<00:01:26.530> and<00:01:26.979> it<00:01:27.100> just<00:01:27.340> launches<00:01:27.850> out<00:01:28.000> of<00:01:28.090> the

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:28.150 
wheels and it just launches out of the

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:33.300 
wheels and it just launches out of the
corners

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:33.310 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:35.590 

my<00:01:34.310> first<00:01:34.579> impressions<00:01:35.090> on<00:01:35.270> this<00:01:35.390> car

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600 
my first impressions on this car

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.690 
my first impressions on this car
obviously<00:01:36.079> you<00:01:36.590> know<00:01:36.710> this<00:01:36.860> is<00:01:37.040> the<00:01:37.159> uber<00:01:37.460> golf

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:37.700 
obviously you know this is the uber golf

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.320 
obviously you know this is the uber golf
this<00:01:38.030> is<00:01:38.090> the<00:01:38.890> all-wheel-drive<00:01:40.330> highest

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:41.330 
this is the all-wheel-drive highest

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:43.539 
this is the all-wheel-drive highest
horsepower<00:01:41.750> version<00:01:42.049> that's<00:01:42.530> available<00:01:42.619> it's

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:43.549 
horsepower version that's available it's

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:45.840 
horsepower version that's available it's
kind<00:01:43.820> of<00:01:43.880> a<00:01:43.939> halo<00:01:44.119> car<00:01:44.450> for<00:01:44.630> Volkswagen<00:01:44.840> so

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:45.850 
kind of a halo car for Volkswagen so

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:47.950 
kind of a halo car for Volkswagen so
naturally<00:01:46.850> it<00:01:47.000> sets<00:01:47.299> the<00:01:47.450> bar<00:01:47.479> pretty<00:01:47.810> high

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960 
naturally it sets the bar pretty high

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.320 
naturally it sets the bar pretty high
you<00:01:48.409> already<00:01:48.979> got<00:01:49.100> a<00:01:49.159> great<00:01:49.399> GTI<00:01:49.789> to<00:01:49.909> start

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:50.330 
you already got a great GTI to start

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:52.570 
you already got a great GTI to start
with<00:01:50.509> and<00:01:50.869> then<00:01:51.259> to<00:01:51.560> even<00:01:51.890> try<00:01:52.009> to<00:01:52.070> elevate

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:52.580 
with and then to even try to elevate

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:54.760 
with and then to even try to elevate
that<00:01:53.000> higher<00:01:53.179> you<00:01:53.689> really<00:01:54.110> have<00:01:54.259> to<00:01:54.409> step<00:01:54.619> it

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770 
that higher you really have to step it

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:56.020 
that higher you really have to step it
up<00:01:54.890> and<00:01:55.130> I<00:01:55.250> think<00:01:55.460> looks<00:01:55.640> like<00:01:55.759> it's<00:01:55.909> done<00:01:55.970> a

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.030 
up and I think looks like it's done a

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:04.510 
up and I think looks like it's done a
great<00:01:56.270> job<00:01:56.299> with<00:01:56.659> this<00:01:56.840> car

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:04.520 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.880 

our<00:02:05.520> is<00:02:06.420> one<00:02:06.630> of<00:02:06.750> those<00:02:06.840> cars<00:02:07.170> that<00:02:07.530> kind<00:02:07.770> of

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
our is one of those cars that kind of

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.590 
our is one of those cars that kind of
this<00:02:08.039> is<00:02:08.640> greater<00:02:08.970> than<00:02:09.119> the<00:02:09.240> sum<00:02:09.420> of<00:02:09.450> its

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:09.600 
this is greater than the sum of its

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.740 
this is greater than the sum of its
parts<00:02:09.720> in<00:02:10.229> every<00:02:10.890> way<00:02:11.039> it<00:02:11.640> has<00:02:11.910> a<00:02:11.940> fantastic

parts in every way it has a fantastic
interior<00:02:13.020> it<00:02:13.800> has<00:02:13.920> a<00:02:13.950> really<00:02:14.310> nice<00:02:14.430> attention

interior it has a really nice attention

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.220 
interior it has a really nice attention
to<00:02:14.910> detail<00:02:15.000> that<00:02:15.330> you<00:02:15.569> would<00:02:15.600> expect<00:02:15.959> in<00:02:16.170> a

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
to detail that you would expect in a

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.630 
to detail that you would expect in a
German<00:02:16.560> car<00:02:16.850> if<00:02:17.850> it<00:02:18.450> writes<00:02:18.830> and<00:02:19.830> goes<00:02:20.489> down

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
German car if it writes and goes down

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.910 
German car if it writes and goes down
the<00:02:20.760> road<00:02:20.910> like<00:02:21.270> a<00:02:21.450> far<00:02:22.080> more<00:02:22.110> expensive<00:02:22.530> car

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
the road like a far more expensive car

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.880 
the road like a far more expensive car
