00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:13.940 
well it looks like the berry bushes are

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:16.140 
well it looks like the berry bushes are
really<00:00:14.940> starting<00:00:15.240> to<00:00:15.360> put<00:00:15.630> on

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:16.150 
really starting to put on

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:23.550 
really starting to put on
-<00:00:16.360> a<00:00:19.980> lot<00:00:20.980> of<00:00:21.010> berries<00:00:21.430> this<00:00:21.640> year

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:23.560 
- a lot of berries this year

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:26.609 
- a lot of berries this year
so<00:00:24.130> I<00:00:24.160> don't<00:00:24.400> think<00:00:24.580> this<00:00:24.820> this<00:00:25.780> area<00:00:26.200> here<00:00:26.590> has

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:26.619 
so I don't think this this area here has

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:31.920 
so I don't think this this area here has
been<00:00:27.130> hit<00:00:27.430> too<00:00:27.990> hard<00:00:28.990> with<00:00:29.410> the<00:00:30.000> drought<00:00:31.000> it's

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:31.930 
been hit too hard with the drought it's

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:35.760 
been hit too hard with the drought it's
still<00:00:32.680> pretty<00:00:32.950> green<00:00:33.400> and<00:00:34.090> lush<00:00:34.510> and<00:00:34.989> the

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:35.770 
still pretty green and lush and the

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:37.840 
ferns are really tall which means it's

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:45.750 
ferns are really tall which means it's
