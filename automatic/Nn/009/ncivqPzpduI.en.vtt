00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
sticks before it so i probably had like

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.719 
sticks before it so i probably had like
pigment<00:01:09.960> from<00:01:10.500> the<00:01:10.680> other<00:01:10.830> lipstick<00:01:11.310> left<00:01:11.580> on

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:23.900 
where lips are dry and it makes it stick

00:04:26.449 --> 00:04:29.650 
out even worse with satin finishes like
snob<00:04:26.780> it<00:04:27.199> the<00:04:27.680> color<00:04:27.919> still<00:04:28.250> goes<00:04:28.430> over<00:04:28.910> the

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:29.660 
snob it the color still goes over the

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:31.750 
snob it the color still goes over the
crack<00:04:29.960> areas<00:04:30.410> it<00:04:30.710> just<00:04:30.979> makes<00:04:31.130> it<00:04:31.250> look<00:04:31.310> dryer

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:31.760 
crack areas it just makes it look dryer

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:33.700

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:33.710 
but the color is still on it so you can

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:35.140 
but the color is still on it so you can
just<00:04:33.740> throw<00:04:33.889> some<00:04:34.190> lip<00:04:34.340> gloss<00:04:34.370> on<00:04:34.699> top<00:04:34.760> of<00:04:35.030> it

you're<00:05:08.300> thinking<00:05:08.660> about<00:05:08.840> looking<00:05:09.050> for<00:05:09.350> an

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:09.440 
you're thinking about looking for an

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:11.830 
you're thinking about looking for an
everyday<00:05:09.800> color<00:05:10.310> to<00:05:10.729> wear<00:05:10.970> something<00:05:11.810> more

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:11.840 
everyday color to wear something more

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:14.200 
everyday color to wear something more
towards<00:05:12.350> the<00:05:12.500> pink<00:05:12.800> it's<00:05:13.039> not<00:05:13.400> necessarily

towards the pink it's not necessarily

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:16.540 
towards the pink it's not necessarily
nude<00:05:14.479> pink<00:05:15.320> I<00:05:15.560> think<00:05:15.949> it<00:05:16.070> would<00:05:16.250> be<00:05:16.280> if<00:05:16.520> you
