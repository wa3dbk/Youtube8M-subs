be huge I think it still hasn't sunk in

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.590 
be huge I think it still hasn't sunk in
quite<00:01:51.930> that<00:01:51.960> we<00:01:52.439> actually<00:01:52.619> won<00:01:53.009> the<00:01:53.220> thing<00:01:53.399> I

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:53.600 
quite that we actually won the thing I

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.670 
quite that we actually won the thing I
hear<00:01:54.600> you<00:01:54.810> guys<00:01:54.990> talking<00:01:55.049> about<00:01:55.439> it<00:01:55.590> some

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
hear you guys talking about it some

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.499 
hear you guys talking about it some
times<00:01:56.040> here<00:01:56.189> and<00:01:56.280> there<00:01:56.340> but<00:01:56.700> you<00:01:57.180> still<00:01:57.390> don't

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
times here and there but you still don't

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:00.560 
times here and there but you still don't
like<00:01:57.659> I<00:01:58.460> haven't<00:01:59.460> quite<00:01:59.820> understand<00:02:00.329> that<00:02:00.450> it

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
like I haven't quite understand that it

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.749 
like I haven't quite understand that it
yet<00:02:00.719> so<00:02:01.020> i<00:02:01.229> think<00:02:01.799> when<00:02:02.070> i<00:02:02.100> get<00:02:02.280> the<00:02:02.430> ring<00:02:02.579> i

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
yet so i think when i get the ring i

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.100 
yet so i think when i get the ring i
it's<00:02:03.000> going<00:02:03.030> to<00:02:03.180> be<00:02:03.240> pretty<00:02:03.299> emotional<00:02:03.840> for<00:02:04.020> me

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
it's going to be pretty emotional for me

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.289 
it's going to be pretty emotional for me
I<00:02:04.140> may<00:02:04.469> be<00:02:04.530> that<00:02:04.740> that's<00:02:05.040> when<00:02:05.250> when<00:02:06.000> I<00:02:06.060> finally

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
I may be that that's when when I finally

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:07.700 
I may be that that's when when I finally
can<00:02:06.509> understand<00:02:06.899> the<00:02:07.049> way<00:02:07.140> we<00:02:07.170> accomplished
