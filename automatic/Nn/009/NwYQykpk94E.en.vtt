00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:08.099
 hello to all welcome on his web tv 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.990
 you are a fashion victim tells you 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:11.670
 you're connected I have to buy 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.040
 a bracelet connected yes my life in 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.990
 depends another moment I'm too much at this 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.670
 completely empty so how to choose 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.230
 and here we are, luckily 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.760
 we are here we will tell you everything 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.080
 how to choose your connected bracelet 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.080
 it's now on 01net tv 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:34.600
 so the period is good because he 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:36.970
 gets out pretty much every week 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.660
 connected bracelets and then again 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:38.290
 many others who must arrive 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:39.730
 shortly 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:41.590
 it becomes the jungle and it's a bit 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:43.150
 complicated to navigate 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:45.640
 luckily we are a little bit 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:47.620
 oral of the brass the connectors are going 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:50.140
 help you good then what's the point 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:52.269
 the connected bracelet let's start with the 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:54.910
 low bases is already working to count the 

00:00:52.269 --> 00:00:56.830
 not that you do every day yes 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:58.150
 to make you walk since you 

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:59.470
 know to be in shape you have to walk 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:02.050
 ten thousand steps a day minimum 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:03.760
 accordingly accordingly 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:05.619
 consequence but hey it'll give you 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:08.560
 also the number of calories burned 

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:10.060
 and yes no calories etc it's good for 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.860
 health that good for health 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.119
 certainly a bracelet but not all can 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:16.240
 watch your sleep 

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:18.130
 he sees that you are falling asleep 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.600
 that she wake you up the calculation so 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:21.340
 all the same time you slept and in 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.229
 more if you slept well if you 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:24.910
 have restless sleep or not if you 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:25.330
 have done well all your phases of 

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:28.180
 sleep 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:30.190
 here are some also going to take the 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:31.750
 pulse for you then not the one I have 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:32.890
 the hand through his hair in the pulse 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:36.009
 heartbeat 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:38.140
 yeah so he does not have much who 

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:40.090
 go to our realities there is the football is 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:42.789
 a new feature he has the 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:46.209
 future gear fit of samsung mainly 

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:47.410
 and then there is the pulse of 8.6 but that 

00:01:46.209 --> 00:01:48.849
 is not a bracelet that is a small 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:50.679
 stuff that goes in the pocket like that 

00:01:48.849 --> 00:01:52.149
 and icing on the cake if your 

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:54.369
 bracelet is hyper connected he goes 

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:56.110
 to be able to tell you the notifications 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:58.149
 your sms smartphone 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.860
 after the ex and then we go out a little 

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:02.050
 little to basic functionality of the 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:04.330
 bracelet to go to what do the 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:06.789
 connected watches and this is the case 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:09.940
 especially here again the future gear made of 

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:12.690
 samsung or also the live band bracelet 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.690
 of lg 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.790
 so how does it work bracelets 

00:02:15.409 --> 00:02:17.989
 connected because I want to tell you 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:21.620
 that technology in there 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:22.670
 yeah in this little little thing in 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.620
 plastic there are full full of 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:27.310
 technical but there it is these famous 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:30.040
 sensor 1 that will detect motion 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:33.260
 the acceleration pains did indeed 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:35.239
 of accelerometers the pulse sensor 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.620
 of course for some it was said and 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:38.030
 all this is transmitted to the application 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.319
 because it's really called 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.250
 connected because it's connected with 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:42.079
 the mobile phone 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:43.519
 that's it with a mobile app that 

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:46.340
 is more or less successful need to know 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:48.799
 that every manufacturer of bracelets to 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.930
 develop his mobile app one that is going 

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:53.120
 have some specificities 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:54.319
 we liked jawbone's one 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.720
 was talking about some time ago 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:58.250
 01net on tv here after how that 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.930
 walk because it takes the 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:00.859
 connectivity a this bracelet it takes 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:03.049
 that they communicate with your 

00:03:00.859 --> 00:03:04.849
 smartphone is good for most 

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:06.230
 is the Bluetooth low energy is 

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:08.239
 this new generation of all that 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:10.280
 consumes very little and that actually allows 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:11.810
 to extend the autonomy of the bracelet but 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:13.489
 you need a compatible smartphone with 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:15.560
 only the last generations of 

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:17.989
 smartphone for example from 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.430
 the iphone 4s he would see xi is king are 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:22.099
 compatible bluetooth low energy 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:23.630
 otherwise it remains for some bracelet 

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:25.910
 the first generations the possibility 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:28.579
 to plug them into hard with a port on 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:30.530
 the usb port or even with a 

00:03:28.579 --> 00:03:32.120
 kind of wifi owners like on 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:33.829
 fitbit thanks to a little dongle 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:35.480
 branch on the computer 

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:36.590
 So here are lots of technologies in 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:38.150
 his bracelets but the question we get 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:38.840
 poses finally is what we can do 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:40.940
 trust 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:42.799
 actually in these connected bracelets is 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:44.510
 what is reliable we put the 

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:45.739
 question our reporter 01net opinion 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:46.970
 nogueira this question is 

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:48.829
 actually quite justified 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:50.629
 since that is the strength of 

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:53.180
 its sensors of its activity trackers 

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:54.889
 the problem is that among the 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:57.139
 builders actually we do a little bit 

00:03:54.889 --> 00:03:59.030
 fine mouth on on this subject so I'm 

00:03:57.139 --> 00:04:00.470
 am turned towards a society that 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:02.959
 manufactures these analog accelerometer 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:04.970
 devices that told me so about his 

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:06.680
 technology that is actually integrated with a 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:08.239
 product which is the wwoofing pulse 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:09.290
 what is certain is that all and 

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:11.090
 accelerometer are today 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:12.739
 visibly of good quality are all 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:14.780
 compatible three axes they all arrive 

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:16.130
 more or less effectively to detect 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:17.419
 all the movements in the air to 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:19.039
 to identify the steps is what makes 

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:20.989
 really the difference is really what 

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:22.880
 on what points analog devices went into 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:25.100
 does the algorithm that is behind 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:26.960
 there this time well it's ball of the 

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:29.090
 side of the builders who have to 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:30.800
 actually created a software development in 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:33.890
 anyway something that is capable 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:34.550
 to interpret all the movements of the 

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:36.260
 accelerometer 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:37.910
 for example if I have a bracelet that I 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:39.260
 make a move like that where like that 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:40.700
 or simply a fake 

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.060
 move I move my mouse on my 

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:43.370
 office 

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:45.260
 what makes the 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:46.790
 bracelet will interpret or not this 

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:48.500
 given as a step others are 

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:49.760
 able to interpret the phases of 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:51.290
 sleep I have models that I test 

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:53.480
 currently who are actually going 

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:54.950
 vary the number of steps while 

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:56.990
 I'm in a scooter here it's all 

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:59.720
 these data and left to the free 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:00.560
 builder appreciation what is 

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:02.600
 sure is that there is a small 

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:07.070
 improvement that is underway but there 

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:07.940
 still work on the subject then the 

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:09.950
 question you ask is how 

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:12.380
 choose how to choose this or that 

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:14.960
 connected bracelet you have to know that 

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:16.340
 typically the display or not 

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:17.540
 the display or not on the bracelet can 

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:19.220
 to be a choice a criterion of choice 

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:20.330
 yes because there are bracelets that 

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:22.520
 have no display at all 

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:23.450
 technically the our good advantage 

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:25.820
 is that it makes a bracelet 

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:27.530
 toddlers very fine very light you 

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:30.230
 have a bracelet with which of 

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:31.820
 small led that are already going 

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:32.900
 for example, to provide information on the number of 

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:34.550
 not that you did these few 

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:36.890
 indicators of be2 makes us all go 

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:37.340
 exactly like on the nike or on the 

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:39.470
 huawei 

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:42.230
 and then we can go straight 

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:43.970
 the touch screen and again it's at 

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:45.560
 samsung with guerlain or at home 

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:47.930
 lg we find that with them screens 

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:49.640
 especially oled from samsung and son who 

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:50.420
 is a very very beautiful screen that gives 

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:51.950
 a lot of information 

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:53.210
 good of course what is important this 

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:54.920
 are the features that is what 

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:56.180
 what does he do not do and that 

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:59.030
 it's based on what you 

00:05:56.180 --> 00:06:00.830
 wish and its impacts the price because 

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:02.570
 the more it is the performer and the more it is 

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:04.580
 expensive then you have to know that all his 

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:06.140
 his arms are waterproof an ip57 the 

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:07.580
 most part-time fadoq and resists 

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:08.960
 splashing this is waterproof is not everything 

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:10.730
 in fact the mozilla which is resistant to water 

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:11.990
 but you can for example 

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:13.700
 transform into commander cousteau with 

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:15.920
 it did not work it is not recommended 

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:18.330
 and then the autonomy so good here are the 

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:19.830
 newer hold a week 

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:21.900
 you have to know that the more they have 

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:23.490
 the display and chips obviously - 

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:25.319
 autonomy will be important 

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:27.090
 doubt and then last criterion of course 

00:06:25.319 --> 00:06:29.129
 well it's the most subjective and the 

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:31.530
 more personal is the design the look 

00:06:29.129 --> 00:06:33.599
 so that depends on your taste and then 

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:34.379
 try to try these bracelets because 

00:06:33.599 --> 00:06:35.610
 you will see that some have 

00:06:34.379 --> 00:06:36.120
 maybe you look a little fat a 

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:38.250
 little heavy 

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:39.750
 others know better how to be forgotten 

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:41.189
 try it because it's true that in 

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:43.110
 comfort and then also 

00:06:41.189 --> 00:06:44.610
 prison in hand I was going to say that's 

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:46.080
 important to know if we feel good 

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:48.120
 with this bracelet and if you really 

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:49.979
 are allergic to this thing to your 

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:51.419
 wrist you can opt for for the 

00:06:49.979 --> 00:06:52.740
 small sensor the little tracker we are 

00:06:51.419 --> 00:06:53.819
 in the pocket is another option 

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:54.599
 quite and then you have to know that 

00:06:53.819 --> 00:06:56.340
 most smartphones too 

00:06:54.599 --> 00:06:58.560
 today have applications that 

00:06:56.340 --> 00:07:00.030
 also allow for accounting for 

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:01.500
 not that you do in the day 

00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:03.419
 but hey, there is not much 

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:04.409
 information about all these 

00:07:03.419 --> 00:07:06.150
 breweries that make a lot more 

00:07:04.409 --> 00:07:08.400
 this is the name of the bracelet these letters 

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:10.050
 a priori more precise and more complete 

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:12.090
 of course that's what we could say 

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:13.529
 maybe we helped you choose 

00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:13.919
 your bracelet quality in any case it is 

00:07:13.529 --> 00:07:15.719
 wish 

00:07:13.919 --> 00:07:18.439
 01net tv one finds oneself of course gives 

00:07:15.719 --> 00:07:18.439
 a salute to all
