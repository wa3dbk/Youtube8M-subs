00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:32.900 
that's the same thing on this one this
hand<00:02:29.970> and<00:02:30.470> sword<00:02:31.470> are<00:02:31.770> all<00:02:31.980> a<00:02:32.010> separate<00:02:32.610> piece

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
hand and sword are all a separate piece

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:36.080 
hand and sword are all a separate piece
but<00:02:33.690> again<00:02:34.020> it's<00:02:34.290> the<00:02:34.530> only<00:02:35.190> way<00:02:35.400> that<00:02:35.910> I<00:02:35.940> can

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
but again it's the only way that I can

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.150 
but again it's the only way that I can
fit<00:02:36.510> them<00:02:36.750> without<00:02:37.140> having<00:02:37.470> to<00:02:37.530> get<00:02:37.680> a<00:02:37.709> custom

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
fit them without having to get a custom

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:39.860 
fit them without having to get a custom
box<00:02:38.430> if<00:02:38.670> I<00:02:38.790> have<00:02:38.880> to<00:02:39.000> start<00:02:39.209> getting<00:02:39.360> custom

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
box if I have to start getting custom

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:47.000 
box if I have to start getting custom
boxes<00:02:41.989> they<00:02:42.989> are<00:02:43.170> not<00:02:43.380> cheap<00:02:43.850> anyway<00:02:45.800> there<00:02:46.800> he

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
boxes they are not cheap anyway there he

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:51.710 
boxes they are not cheap anyway there he
is<00:02:47.130> again<00:02:47.160> and<00:02:49.250> there<00:02:50.250> is<00:02:50.640> the<00:02:50.700> very<00:02:51.300> first<00:02:51.540> one

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
is again and there is the very first one

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:57.340 
is again and there is the very first one
I<00:02:51.900> did<00:02:53.000> and<00:02:54.830> here<00:02:55.830> was<00:02:55.950> the<00:02:56.130> last<00:02:56.340> one<00:02:56.670> I<00:02:56.700> did

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:57.350 
I did and here was the last one I did

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:01.490 
I did and here was the last one I did
and<00:02:58.350> I<00:02:58.980> think<00:02:59.310> that's<00:02:59.760> yet<00:03:00.269> yes<00:03:00.870> that<00:03:01.260> was<00:03:01.470> it

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
and I think that's yet yes that was it

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.600 
and I think that's yet yes that was it
but<00:03:02.130> again<00:03:02.459> my<00:03:03.500> video<00:03:04.500> that<00:03:04.709> I<00:03:04.739> tried<00:03:05.069> to<00:03:05.340> tape

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
but again my video that I tried to tape

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:08.870 
but again my video that I tried to tape
of<00:03:05.880> them<00:03:06.239> didn't<00:03:06.900> come<00:03:07.260> out<00:03:07.950> so<00:03:08.069> well<00:03:08.489> but

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
of them didn't come out so well but

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.840 
of them didn't come out so well but
actually<00:03:09.890> they<00:03:10.890> show<00:03:11.130> better<00:03:11.340> this<00:03:11.610> way

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850 
actually they show better this way

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:16.880 
actually they show better this way
anyway<00:03:12.360> and<00:03:14.450> there<00:03:15.450> we<00:03:15.840> go<00:03:16.019> and<00:03:16.290> I<00:03:16.470> hope<00:03:16.680> you
