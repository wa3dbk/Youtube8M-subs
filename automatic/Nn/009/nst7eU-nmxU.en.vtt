square<00:00:09.090> feet<00:00:09.469> we're<00:00:10.469> building<00:00:10.769> it<00:00:10.860> in<00:00:10.980> modules

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
square feet we're building it in modules

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:13.220 
square feet we're building it in modules
because<00:00:11.849> it<00:00:12.150> needs<00:00:12.300> to<00:00:12.450> be<00:00:12.540> transported<00:00:13.019> to

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
because it needs to be transported to

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.259 
because it needs to be transported to
the<00:00:13.349> National<00:00:13.799> Mall<00:00:13.950> for<00:00:14.519> a<00:00:14.580> contest<00:00:15.000> in

has<00:00:18.420> been<00:00:18.449> a<00:00:18.660> tremendous<00:00:19.260> experience<00:00:19.350> I<00:00:19.890> kind

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
has been a tremendous experience I kind

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:21.620 
has been a tremendous experience I kind
of<00:00:20.279> got<00:00:20.460> into<00:00:20.699> it<00:00:20.850> through<00:00:21.210> my<00:00:21.359> advisor

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
of got into it through my advisor

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.269 
of got into it through my advisor
because<00:00:22.050> I'm<00:00:22.140> in<00:00:22.230> the<00:00:22.289> solar<00:00:22.500> energy<00:00:22.619> lab<00:00:22.949> and

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
because I'm in the solar energy lab and

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.009 
because I'm in the solar energy lab and
it's<00:00:23.910> just<00:00:24.210> been<00:00:24.390> this<00:00:24.600> phenomenal

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
it's just been this phenomenal

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:26.269 
it's just been this phenomenal
experience<00:00:25.439> I've<00:00:25.590> learned<00:00:25.619> so<00:00:25.980> much<00:00:26.099> about

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
experience I've learned so much about

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.310 
experience I've learned so much about
home<00:00:26.939> construction<00:00:27.240> in<00:00:27.539> architecture<00:00:28.140> and

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
home construction in architecture and

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.859 
home construction in architecture and
how<00:00:29.250> we<00:00:29.310> incorporate<00:00:29.789> that<00:00:30.119> into<00:00:30.330> engineering

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
how we incorporate that into engineering

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.630 
how we incorporate that into engineering
it's<00:00:31.529> been<00:00:31.740> a<00:00:31.769> fantastic<00:00:32.489> learning

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
it's been a fantastic learning

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.370 
it's been a fantastic learning
experience<00:00:33.149> it's<00:00:33.899> been<00:00:34.050> kind<00:00:34.230> of<00:00:34.260> crazy

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
experience it's been kind of crazy

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.590 
experience it's been kind of crazy
earlier<00:00:35.340> on<00:00:35.550> we<00:00:35.850> took<00:00:36.149> a<00:00:36.210> little<00:00:36.360> bit<00:00:36.540> more

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
earlier on we took a little bit more

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.389 
earlier on we took a little bit more
relaxed<00:00:37.170> approach<00:00:37.260> to<00:00:37.649> it<00:00:37.739> inviting<00:00:38.160> everyone

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
relaxed approach to it inviting everyone

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.720 
relaxed approach to it inviting everyone
into<00:00:39.000> design<00:00:39.930> sessions<00:00:40.469> into<00:00:41.100> discussions

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
into design sessions into discussions

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.459 
into design sessions into discussions
about<00:00:41.850> what<00:00:42.030> the<00:00:42.059> concept<00:00:42.510> should<00:00:42.570> be<00:00:42.809> as<00:00:43.050> we

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
about what the concept should be as we

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:44.840 
about what the concept should be as we
get<00:00:43.620> closer<00:00:43.829> and<00:00:44.129> closer<00:00:44.280> to<00:00:44.489> the<00:00:44.579> end<00:00:44.700> right

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
get closer and closer to the end right

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.580 
get closer and closer to the end right
now<00:00:44.910> we're<00:00:45.180> six<00:00:45.360> months<00:00:45.629> off<00:00:45.750> we're<00:00:46.050> kind<00:00:46.559> of

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
now we're six months off we're kind of

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:47.840 
now we're six months off we're kind of
in<00:00:46.710> a<00:00:46.770> frantic<00:00:46.980> mode<00:00:47.280> where<00:00:47.460> we're<00:00:47.550> doing<00:00:47.640> both

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
in a frantic mode where we're doing both

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.209 
in a frantic mode where we're doing both
construction<00:00:48.329> and<00:00:48.750> fixing<00:00:49.410> up<00:00:49.500> drawings<00:00:49.920> and

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
construction and fixing up drawings and

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:51.799 
construction and fixing up drawings and
dealing<00:00:50.550> with<00:00:50.670> communication<00:00:50.969> stuff<00:00:51.570> so

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
dealing with communication stuff so

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.959 
dealing with communication stuff so
where<00:00:51.960> our<00:00:52.590> team<00:00:52.770> is<00:00:52.890> really<00:00:53.070> really<00:00:53.309> busy<00:00:53.460> I

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
where our team is really really busy I

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.430 
where our team is really really busy I
think<00:00:54.390> what<00:00:54.510> we're<00:00:54.629> trying<00:00:54.780> to<00:00:54.930> do<00:00:55.050> is<00:00:55.260> just

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
think what we're trying to do is just

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.099 
think what we're trying to do is just
essentially<00:00:56.039> raise<00:00:56.329> awareness<00:00:57.329> about<00:00:57.750> all

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
essentially raise awareness about all

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.020 
essentially raise awareness about all
the<00:00:58.260> things<00:00:58.500> that<00:00:58.620> people<00:00:58.710> can<00:00:59.070> do<00:00:59.219> to<00:00:59.489> have<00:01:00.000> a

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
the things that people can do to have a

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.299 
the things that people can do to have a
house<00:01:00.270> that<00:01:00.570> might<00:01:01.469> be<00:01:01.680> a<00:01:01.710> solution<00:01:01.859> to<00:01:02.129> some

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
house that might be a solution to some

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.729 
house that might be a solution to some
of<00:01:02.399> the<00:01:02.460> problems<00:01:02.820> that<00:01:02.910> we<00:01:03.120> are<00:01:03.149> facing<00:01:03.739> so

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
of the problems that we are facing so

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.530 
of the problems that we are facing so
when<00:01:05.309> we<00:01:05.400> build<00:01:05.729> a<00:01:05.790> solar<00:01:06.000> house<00:01:06.180> we're<00:01:06.390> really

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
when we build a solar house we're really

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.480 
when we build a solar house we're really
trying<00:01:06.840> to<00:01:06.930> use<00:01:07.140> all<00:01:07.439> the<00:01:07.560> technology<00:01:08.100> we<00:01:08.130> can

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
trying to use all the technology we can

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.630 
trying to use all the technology we can
and<00:01:08.869> showcase<00:01:09.869> it<00:01:09.900> in<00:01:10.200> ways<00:01:10.470> that<00:01:10.890> maybe<00:01:11.490> the

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
and showcase it in ways that maybe the

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.850 
and showcase it in ways that maybe the
public<00:01:11.760> can<00:01:12.090> see<00:01:12.479> and<00:01:12.750> understand<00:01:13.590> how<00:01:13.710> they

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
public can see and understand how they

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.020 
public can see and understand how they
might<00:01:14.010> be<00:01:14.070> able<00:01:14.340> to<00:01:14.430> implement<00:01:14.640> it<00:01:14.820> in<00:01:14.939> the

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
might be able to implement it in the

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.789 
might be able to implement it in the
same<00:01:15.240> way<00:01:15.390> or<00:01:15.630> possibly<00:01:16.409> an<00:01:16.530> entirely

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
same way or possibly an entirely

same way or possibly an entirely
different<00:01:16.950> way<00:01:17.250> that's<00:01:17.580> the<00:01:17.850> whole<00:01:18.000> idea<00:01:18.390> of

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
different way that's the whole idea of

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.980 
different way that's the whole idea of
this<00:01:18.840> type<00:01:19.259> of<00:01:19.290> house<00:01:19.650> is<00:01:19.979> we're<00:01:20.790> using<00:01:20.990> for

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
this type of house is we're using for

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.170 
this type of house is we're using for
the<00:01:22.080> most<00:01:22.259> part<00:01:22.560> very<00:01:22.860> conventional<00:01:23.520> building

on this hadn't happen for this project

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.670 
on this hadn't happen for this project
so<00:02:11.940> it's<00:02:12.480> really<00:02:12.720> high<00:02:12.989> value

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
so it's really high value

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.319 
so it's really high value
for<00:02:14.040> many<00:02:14.189> reasons<00:02:14.280> that<00:02:14.819> have<00:02:14.939> been<00:02:15.120> really

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:15.329 
for many reasons that have been really

00:02:15.329 --> 00:02:17.089 
for many reasons that have been really
inspirational<00:02:15.720> to<00:02:16.140> work<00:02:16.260> with<00:02:16.439> with<00:02:16.980> these

00:02:17.089 --> 00:02:17.099 
inspirational to work with with these

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:18.740 
inspirational to work with with these
students<00:02:17.579> I<00:02:17.670> just<00:02:18.030> can't<00:02:18.209> believe<00:02:18.299> how<00:02:18.599> much

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
students I just can't believe how much

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:19.970 
students I just can't believe how much
energy<00:02:19.049> they've<00:02:19.409> given<00:02:19.739> to<00:02:19.769> the<00:02:19.890> project

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980

energy they've given to the project
earlier<00:02:20.939> on<00:02:21.150> we've<00:02:21.420> had<00:02:21.450> problems

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
earlier on we've had problems

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.350 
earlier on we've had problems
communicating<00:02:22.319> across<00:02:22.920> the<00:02:23.159> table<00:02:23.310> you<00:02:24.209> work

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
communicating across the table you work

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:25.429 
communicating across the table you work
at<00:02:24.510> different<00:02:24.599> disciplines<00:02:25.140> you<00:02:25.290> have

00:02:25.429 --> 00:02:25.439 
at different disciplines you have

00:02:25.439 --> 00:02:26.899 
at different disciplines you have
different<00:02:25.829> fields<00:02:26.159> and<00:02:26.220> there's<00:02:26.400> a<00:02:26.489> different

00:02:26.899 --> 00:02:26.909 
different fields and there's a different

00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:28.850 
different fields and there's a different
set<00:02:27.030> of<00:02:27.090> language<00:02:27.689> that<00:02:27.900> you<00:02:27.959> established<00:02:28.620> and

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
set of language that you established and

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.920 
set of language that you established and
so<00:02:29.610> it<00:02:29.760> took<00:02:29.879> us<00:02:29.939> a<00:02:30.150> while<00:02:30.299> to<00:02:30.359> understand

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
so it took us a while to understand

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:32.809 
so it took us a while to understand
where<00:02:31.500> each<00:02:31.530> other<00:02:31.799> came<00:02:32.040> from<00:02:32.250> and<00:02:32.549> what<00:02:32.700> we

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:32.819 
where each other came from and what we

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:34.190 
where each other came from and what we
were<00:02:32.909> trying<00:02:33.120> to<00:02:33.269> communicate<00:02:33.450> but<00:02:33.870> I<00:02:34.019> think

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
were trying to communicate but I think

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.869 
were trying to communicate but I think
our<00:02:34.319> team<00:02:34.530> is<00:02:34.560> far<00:02:34.920> enough<00:02:35.159> far<00:02:35.459> enough<00:02:35.609> along

00:02:35.869 --> 00:02:35.879 
our team is far enough far enough along

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:37.250 
our team is far enough far enough along
now<00:02:36.120> that<00:02:36.450> we're<00:02:36.599> doing<00:02:36.810> really<00:02:37.019> well<00:02:37.200> in

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
now that we're doing really well in

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.020 
now that we're doing really well in
terms<00:02:37.500> of<00:02:37.680> communication<00:02:38.280> I<00:02:38.459> almost<00:02:38.730> get

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
terms of communication I almost get

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.979 
terms of communication I almost get
teary<00:02:39.269> when<00:02:39.450> I<00:02:39.480> talk<00:02:39.750> about<00:02:39.900> this<00:02:40.200> look<00:02:40.560> I<00:02:40.709> did

00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:41.989 
teary when I talk about this look I did

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:45.530 
teary when I talk about this look I did
the<00:02:42.989> students<00:02:43.470> are<00:02:43.590> so<00:02:43.920> amazing<00:02:44.489> I<00:02:44.730> mean<00:02:44.760> the
