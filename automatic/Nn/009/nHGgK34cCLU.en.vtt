00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:16.839
 exact 

00:00:16.839 --> 00:00:19.839
 kist 

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:23.769
 the letter 

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:29.789
 the presence of the past in triumph over the pattern of electric power called it 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.970
 the attention of locals 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:38.690
 own account was also not spoelstra less twisted during such a 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:43.489
 rare bird of pilar in the first time as you can see the model that 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:47.660
 uses very well this is what I most of time to camouflage when 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:52.650
 finally tree trunks we have here she was easily noticed by 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:54.360
 residents 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.030
 it is therefore whether the report sought the veterinarian vera 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:04.150
 Lucia knows very well adenosine extinction these days he is 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:08.190
 widespread in Brazil, but he does not like much of 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:10.859
 how is an animal that feeds on flights 

00:01:10.859 --> 00:01:14.250
 the closed forest would make this kind of feeding difficult 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.470
 it is only becoming clearer why this study shows pork is 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.479
 a very vulnerable animal you realize that not only every day more 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:26.479
 sad of my government the veterinarian 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:29.679
 talked about the pressure of being here because for a long time 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.749
 they are usually camouflaged and at night go out looking for food 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.600
 throughout the state 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:43.850
 defined by many as scary but the veterinarian discouraged 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:48.240
 because of course this site when it marked its territory comments 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.020
 between Iraq but I have a corner in the turn the benfica 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:57.140
 where they sing tnp weapons demarcate territory and people usually find 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:00.869
 that this is a bad omen because the culture is not 93 years old. 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:01.850
 boyfriend 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:05.619
 the construction company will still have the recommendation that we should never 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:07.909
 look for a partner like this 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:15.080
 five that in the majority of the times at 36 minutes are 43 years our children 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.760
 of our grandchildren can see an animal of this wonder of nature 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.389
 rely mainly on us getting smart
