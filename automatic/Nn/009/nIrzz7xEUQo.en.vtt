the two by six redwood into it you can

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.219 
the two by six redwood into it you can
see<00:01:15.119> we're<00:01:15.240> going<00:01:15.299> to<00:01:15.390> build<00:01:15.630> up<00:01:15.900> the<00:01:16.080> sides

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
see we're going to build up the sides

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.710 
see we're going to build up the sides
and<00:01:16.759> really<00:01:17.759> you're<00:01:17.970> building<00:01:18.299> it<00:01:18.360> upside

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
and really you're building it upside

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.830 
and really you're building it upside
down<00:01:18.750> at<00:01:19.170> this<00:01:19.500> stage<00:01:19.740> step<00:01:20.369> four<00:01:20.670> is<00:01:20.850> when<00:01:21.659> you

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
down at this stage step four is when you

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.410 
down at this stage step four is when you
volt<00:01:22.200> it<00:01:22.380> all<00:01:22.560> of<00:01:22.680> the<00:01:22.799> 2<00:01:22.979> by<00:01:23.130> 6<00:01:23.159> into<00:01:23.729> the<00:01:24.240> four

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
volt it all of the 2 by 6 into the four

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:25.940 
volt it all of the 2 by 6 into the four
by<00:01:24.509> four<00:01:24.689> posts<00:01:25.080> and<00:01:25.259> you're<00:01:25.619> going<00:01:25.770> to<00:01:25.830> have

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
by four posts and you're going to have

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.649 
by four posts and you're going to have
little<00:01:26.159> pieces<00:01:26.400> of<00:01:26.580> four<00:01:26.909> by<00:01:27.030> four<00:01:27.240> sticking

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
little pieces of four by four sticking

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.569 
little pieces of four by four sticking
up<00:01:27.750> about<00:01:27.960> six<00:01:28.170> inches<00:01:28.380> so<00:01:29.189> you're<00:01:29.430> going<00:01:29.520> to

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
up about six inches so you're going to

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.240 
up about six inches so you're going to
dig<00:01:30.030> a<00:01:30.060> few<00:01:30.329> holes<00:01:30.570> that<00:01:31.350> match<00:01:31.590> those<00:01:31.950> and

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
dig a few holes that match those and

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.090 
dig a few holes that match those and
then<00:01:32.579> flip<00:01:32.970> the<00:01:33.810> bed<00:01:33.990> over<00:01:34.439> into<00:01:34.799> the<00:01:34.890> hole<00:01:35.070> so

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
then flip the bed over into the hole so

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.740 
then flip the bed over into the hole so
it<00:01:35.369> has<00:01:35.490> little<00:01:35.670> feet<00:01:35.939> sticking<00:01:36.240> into<00:01:36.570> the

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
it has little feet sticking into the

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.630 
it has little feet sticking into the
ground<00:01:36.930> so<00:01:37.619> you<00:01:37.650> need<00:01:37.860> to<00:01:37.979> measure<00:01:38.159> where<00:01:38.490> the

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
ground so you need to measure where the

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:39.980 
ground so you need to measure where the
feet<00:01:38.790> are<00:01:38.939> going<00:01:39.060> to<00:01:39.119> go<00:01:39.240> in<00:01:39.390> the<00:01:39.479> ground<00:01:39.630> so

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:19.830 
and where so figure out what plants are
going<00:02:17.170> to<00:02:17.410> be<00:02:17.590> good<00:02:18.280> for<00:02:18.610> your<00:02:18.820> zone<00:02:19.390> so<00:02:19.780> you

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
figure out what's good so you also want

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.660 
figure out what's good so you also want
to<00:02:33.730> figure<00:02:33.850> out<00:02:34.090> exactly<00:02:35.080> where<00:02:35.980> in<00:02:36.310> the<00:02:36.490> bed

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
to figure out exactly where in the bed

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:39.750 
to figure out exactly where in the bed
the<00:02:37.540> plants<00:02:37.900> are<00:02:38.050> going<00:02:38.290> to<00:02:38.500> go<00:02:38.680> keeping<00:02:39.670> in

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
the plants are going to go keeping in

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.070 
the plants are going to go keeping in
mind<00:02:39.790> that<00:02:40.120> there's<00:02:40.390> going<00:02:40.630> to<00:02:40.720> be<00:02:40.750> a<00:02:40.840> top

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
mind that there's going to be a top

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:43.050 
mind that there's going to be a top
piece<00:02:41.380> that<00:02:41.590> goes<00:02:41.620> around<00:02:42.040> the<00:02:42.400> edge<00:02:42.550> of<00:02:42.580> the

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
piece that goes around the edge of the

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:46.110 
piece that goes around the edge of the
bed<00:02:43.440> so<00:02:44.440> hopefully<00:02:45.400> you've<00:02:45.730> cut<00:02:45.940> those<00:02:46.090> pieces

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
bed so hopefully you've cut those pieces

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.570 
bed so hopefully you've cut those pieces
already<00:02:46.570> and<00:02:46.930> you<00:02:47.320> can<00:02:47.470> actually<00:02:47.650> dry<00:02:48.220> fit

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:48.580 
already and you can actually dry fit

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:51.180 
already and you can actually dry fit
them<00:02:48.760> and<00:02:48.910> see<00:02:49.420> how<00:02:50.080> much<00:02:50.200> space<00:02:50.440> you<00:02:50.500> have<00:02:50.680> for

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190 
them and see how much space you have for

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:53.550 
them and see how much space you have for
your<00:02:51.280> plants<00:02:51.520> so<00:02:52.330> now<00:02:52.450> you're<00:02:52.600> almost<00:02:52.840> done

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
your plants so now you're almost done

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.280 
your plants so now you're almost done
you<00:02:54.010> have<00:02:54.280> your<00:02:54.850> top<00:02:55.150> on<00:02:55.420> you<00:02:55.690> have<00:02:55.840> the<00:02:55.930> plants

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
you have your top on you have the plants

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:57.750 
you have your top on you have the plants
in<00:02:56.440> so<00:02:56.770> you<00:02:56.830> probably<00:02:57.040> want<00:02:57.250> to<00:02:57.340> put<00:02:57.400> down<00:02:57.550> some

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
in so you probably want to put down some

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.120 
in so you probably want to put down some
mulch<00:02:57.970> put<00:02:58.690> in<00:02:58.810> some<00:02:58.959> rocks<00:02:59.170> maybe<00:02:59.590> a<00:02:59.709> lantern

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130 
mulch put in some rocks maybe a lantern

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:02.190 
mulch put in some rocks maybe a lantern
and<00:03:00.400> then<00:03:00.940> you<00:03:01.270> finally<00:03:01.540> get<00:03:01.750> to<00:03:01.870> sit<00:03:02.020> back

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200
