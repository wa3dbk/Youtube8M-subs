00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.279
 My beautiful beauty is personal this video 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:08.040
 that will follow just to say the reason 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:10.050
 Do not bring so many lately 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.670
 reason for not having water in the interview with 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.320
 oil and so on 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:17.369
 so I really expect patience from the 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:19.680
 Your guys, ladies beauty and personal 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.890
 I'll go there, the civil matter wants to bet today. 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.900
 and personal because not bringing so many 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.480
 videos by bringing videos to almost 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.939
 two weeks that I can not a video 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:32.189
 simply because I walk a lot 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:34.170
 frustrated with youtube as the 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.600
 things go on youtube mainly 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.700
 with my channel it 's me too 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.579
 busy having to read school books has 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:44.070
 This year I'm seeing a lot 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.350
 movie you follow me on twitter it's already 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.989
 knowing that I'm coming in the movie 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.820
 legend than playing lately so is 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:54.120
 a number of factors why I do not 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:57.210
 I'm playing is not bringing video is 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:01.350
 person about interview I never promised 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:03.809
 an interview date I always said 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.790
 as soon as man was available 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.500
 to respond to my email 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.930
 answering all the questions that 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.770
 You sent me the interview via the 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.840
 channel 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.220
 I know we're forced to 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:18.390
 interview good question 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:20.610
 quietly but you there you that 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.530
 come here on the channel complain where 'ta' 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.530
 face-to-face interview 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.960
 only I got off my feet please if you 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.299
 ask quietly this interview 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.860
 and such me and ruth I will hide in the greatest 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:34.200
 It's possible to follow me in the 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.869
 twitter makes it easier to chat for 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.180
 everton but do not come and fill the bag 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:43.020
 to fill the bag is to take body 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.890
 Users ranked please meoo interview without 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.380
 That's it folks 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:49.259
 This is really annoying as you are. 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.329
 interview out if it depended on 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:53.549
 me it does not depend on me 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:56.159
 If it were me, the interview would have come out 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:57.479
 five times to fly is to see is but not to depend 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:59.280
 from me unfortunately 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.869
 civilian personnel that serves only to 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.939
 This is to say that I do not represent the 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:06.030
 I'm frustrated with the situation. 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:07.680
 in youtube current is some you can 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.399
 on twitter already know the number of 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.980
 animals to record 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:13.599
 is to see how things happen today in 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.069
 Day on YouTube is all that much. 

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:17.590
 disheartening and such 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:18.939
 But this is what I think is going to happen soon. 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:20.920
 I will soon make a video to 

00:02:18.939 --> 00:02:22.420
 you usually on the channel you want 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.920
 hear the fan noise back here 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:25.420
 Because it has a lot of heat, Sao Paulo. 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.970
 so I will not record without a fan 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:30.790
 Excuse me and that's it , guys, I'm alone. 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:33.519
 I wanted to say that I'm not thinking 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:35.470
 I said a lot lately and the reasons 

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:37.299
 interview when they look at answering 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:39.720
 to imply beauty then these people 

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:39.720
