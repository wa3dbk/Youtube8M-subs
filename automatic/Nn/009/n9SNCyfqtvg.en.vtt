00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.200
 by the side of the road 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.120
 [Music] 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:41.340

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.470

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:51.899
 Something 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:54.440
 I think I have an idea it's true 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.440

 sorry but next time you will do 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:12.540
 more attention to this is how we 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:17.010
 learns no longer play near the road 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:22.560

 [Music] 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:03.640
 I imagine that now kevin is double 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.640
 to return home 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:29.619
 I do not push me 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:29.619
 [Music] 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:37.140

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:39.090
 Kevin Doug 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:41.910
 this is the second accident that you 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:43.590
 avoid today I know but this 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:46.019
 time I really tried not to 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:48.090
 play with the ball kevin you can 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:50.130
 always buy another balloon but you 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:51.330
 only one life is true 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:53.130
 remember these few rules 

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:55.380
 simple to play ball safely 

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:56.780
 which did not play balloon near 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:59.880
 cars 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:01.530
 play at the park when you're focused 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:03.239
 on your balloon for risk of not 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:05.640
 see arriving a car is so 

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:07.080
 dangerous and if your balloon goes on 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:08.850
 the road did not run true 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:11.040
 just wait everything stops 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:14.010
 then cross the road in all 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:15.390
 security and picked up your balloon or 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:21.870
 ask an adult to pick him up 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:23.070
 for or polite and that's of course it's 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:24.900
 boli 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:26.820
 it's a balloon bag you put it 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:28.830
 soccer ball is he like that he is not going 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:30.450
 not ride anywhere when you're wearing 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:32.689
 by the integrated londe who always sees 

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:34.580
 a risk that these first names danger 

00:04:32.689 --> 00:04:36.129
 if you do not have a balloon sakha you can 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:40.249
 use a plastic bag instead 

00:04:36.129 --> 00:04:43.429
 your tv is for you thank you 

00:04:40.249 --> 00:04:47.239

00:04:43.429 --> 00:04:49.819
 he returned thanks police actually 

00:04:47.239 --> 00:04:51.769
 it's a heavy truck gift 

00:04:49.819 --> 00:04:54.439
 he told me he was very upset 

00:04:51.769 --> 00:04:56.860
 to have rolled on your balloon is too much 

00:04:54.439 --> 00:04:56.860
