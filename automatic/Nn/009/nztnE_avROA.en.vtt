00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:26.320
 well I initially believe that the team 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:29.529
 what they lacked were ideas not 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:32.739
 tension and intensity it seems to me that we have 

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:34.670
 failed today in everything the generation 

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:37.820
 of game 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:40.250
 the development mobility especially 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:42.530
 in the last 20 meters and that has 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:44.180
 deprived of being able to get a better 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:46.600
 result especially in the second 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:46.600
 weather 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.400
 the feeling that I have is that our 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.380
 Duty is to fight until the last 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.640
 moment and while this happens and 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:59.960
 as long as mathematics gives us 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.960
 possibilities we are going to stick 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:23.970
 yes but anyway I think that the 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:26.580
 the problems have been different in the 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:29.010
 defeats that we had outside a 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.950
 thing has decided the realsociedad something else 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:34.080
 bilbao and something else totally different 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.960
 today I repeat again on the day 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:38.430
 today what has not been missing is what 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.100
 habitually distinguishes this team 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:43.340
 What is it 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:46.220
 the good workmanship find spaces 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:48.200
 embroidery on the outside we could not 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:49.840
 almost do in the whole party beyond 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.220
 that in the second time we have had 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:54.320
 long the ball has lacked us 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:57.189
 we have not been able to get 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.189
 depth 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.930
 sometimes there are matches that lack a u 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.460
 another thing and obviously to what 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:08.100
 we have cost in the last 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:10.960
 matches is to make a complete match 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:14.550
 where all the facets of the game 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:14.550
 are completely covered 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:37.550
 well obviously if there were even 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.890
 we would have won today the same as bernabéu 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:41.930
 we had to go win even if we had 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:43.970
 tied today to the bernabéu had to go to 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:46.760
 win us what we behind in 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:48.330
 the league and the need to go win that 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.790
 party is 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:52.770
 if today we are footballing in 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.210
 conditions of that happening good is 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:56.520
 Of course we are not at our best 

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:58.320
 version and to play with the real madrid- 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:00.810
 have possibilities we must find the 

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:05.040
 it only missing 15 days to the 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:07.110
 We have this whole party and all this 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.610
 time to try to find us not 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:11.780
 especially considering that now 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:11.780
 we have champions matches 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:18.800
 I think they are different things 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:20.390
 we today have not played a good 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:22.280
 match 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:23.630
 we have also played a good game in 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:26.600
 Manchester and then we played a bad 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:28.100
 party in san sebastián good 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:30.130
 we will try to make it exactly at 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:30.130
 inverse 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:44.630
 good to the best what we 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:47.519
 we understood that all the care and 

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:49.239
 all this 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:51.700
 modifications that we made in the 

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:53.739
 the first part of the year tending to 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:55.569
 now we come in good shape to what 

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:57.730
 better has not been given in the way 

00:03:55.569 --> 00:04:01.299
 expected is true that footballers 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:04.180
 they arrive at this time of year with less 

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:05.620
 minutes with less fatigue we understood that 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:07.660
 at this time it was the time when 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:09.340
 We were arriving in good shape and 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:11.680
 evidently for the last two 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:13.959
 outputs that we have had this this is not 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:16.329
 is happening and we are late 

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:19.650
 February or early March in the 

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:19.650
 moments when everything is defined 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:30.800
 not not for me today what 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:33.789
 We missed a lot is what distinguishes 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:35.780
 to the team that is to improve in the 

00:04:33.789 --> 00:04:37.819
 circulation in the elaboration of game 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:40.220
 obviously in mobility because for 

00:04:37.819 --> 00:04:42.380
 to be able to work well you have to move and 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:44.470
 therefore we have missed overflowing 

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:44.470
 and depth 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:51.940
 well always the rival always tells me 

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:54.910
 I never rule out 

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:56.860
 to the rival and when we won or when 

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:59.830
 we lose if in the previous much less 

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:02.560
 we always always play against an opponent 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:04.270
 and the rival proposes things and we 

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:07.290
 we have to try to solve those 

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:07.290
 questions that the rival proposes 

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:20.450
 good for the third time the contexts 

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:22.640
 missing ideas to make the game missed 

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:25.070
 mobility to elaborate the game 

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:27.560
 lack of depth and uncheck for 

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:30.640
 elaborate the game me in any way 

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:30.640
 there was a lack of attitude 

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:43.680
 good and the second defeat in the 

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:45.979
 last two exits and that without leaving so 

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:48.509
 far and that leaves us worried because 

00:05:45.979 --> 00:05:50.520
 it's time to define the 

00:05:48.509 --> 00:05:52.770
 league and we the last two outings 

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:55.470
 we add zero point I do not need to 

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:57.979
 go to the calderón party to be 

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:57.979
 worried 

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:13.410
 and I think that all that amount of 

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:14.610
 soccer game that we had the 

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:18.240
 amount of time we had the 

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:19.770
 ball to play 45 minutes on everything 

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:22.230
 of the second half without the rival 

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:25.650
 practically kicks us but 

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:27.660
 in such a small space without elaboration 

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:30.600
 well without having good passes without having 

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:32.310
 good from marquez at any given time 

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:34.290
 transforms into impotence it is clear that 

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:36.840
 there were moments of the match in the in the 

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:38.580
 start of the second time where we had 

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:40.160
 two punctual plays that maybe if 

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:42.720
 we would have achieved the tie 

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:45.690
 transformed all this did not give us much 

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:48.060
 more confidence to us when it comes to 

00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:50.610
 generate game and maybe it made you doubt 

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:52.290
 no opponent has been unable to no longer be 

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:55.190
 As the minutes passed, the 

00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:55.190
 impotence did not win 

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:07.480
 is that I think we almost never had 

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:10.150
 possibility of being direct came out a 

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:12.550
 play that was the one of leo in the beginning 

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:14.470
 from the second half that was almost more of a 

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:17.100
 defensive mistake that a rating 

00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:19.300
 deep but we have rarely had 

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:21.460
 possibilities of running generally 

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:23.020
 Valladolid when he lost the ball came 

00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:24.730
 in the middle of the field he put his two 

00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:27.100
 centrodelanteros to the height of half of 

00:07:24.730 --> 00:07:28.780
 court and it was always a fence of 10 

00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:30.310
 footballers that we had to overcome 

00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:31.840
 I'm sure that if we had had 

00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:35.340
 possibility of running we would have 

00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:35.340
 done because it was what was best for us
