00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:13.010
 hello everyone today let's try to 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:14.840
 awaken the golfer's mind let's 

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:18.380
 enter fully in training 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:20.330
 mental and we've already seen the obvious 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:23.060
 importance of the sports psychologist 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:24.650
 within the sport and also also 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:26.779
 we have seen how to analyze now what 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:29.539
 what we have to do is connect the 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:31.220
 purely technical part of the swing with the 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:32.870
 mind for it we can use 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:34.940
 different types of exercises myself 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:38.090
 I avail myself of one person 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:41.330
 I learned with vision 54 that it is a group of 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:44.420
 Americans that is based on a 

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:46.550
 swing technique timing btw 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:48.650
 vision 54 has a very interesting book 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:50.060
 which is called every stroke should have a 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:52.100
 objective that I recommend that you read 

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:55.340
 and within which is this technique that 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:57.620
 let's learn today this is based on the 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:59.210
 taichi that is a martial art and that is 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:02.060
 based on movement in very slow I suppose 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:04.729
 you will have seen everything and will help us 

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:05.990
 much at the time of golf the taxi will 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:07.540
 has almost become a technique of 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:10.720
 meditation more than a 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:12.220
 shower technique for that physical connection 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:14.800
 spiritual and this what we want to do 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:17.170
 make that connection as I tell you between the 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:19.530
 the body and mind has been discovered 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:21.880
 that when players make a swing 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.830
 they slowly learn to know their 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.550
 swing concept this is what ben said 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:27.130
 hogan 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:29.080
 and he has checked then what we're going 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:31.229
 to do today is to swing the camera 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:33.760
 very very slow a swing that should last 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:36.550
 even minutes the slower it is 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:38.440
 much better is quite complicated 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:40.300
 requires a very high level of concentration 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:41.890
 high but certainly worth it 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.390
 try it to do this exercise 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:45.160
 let's have the help of Carlos 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.770
 Dominguez who is the professional of the 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:49.270
 eagle closed school and he 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:51.390
 will teach us a little bit how we can 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:54.510
 do this exercise 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:57.330
 and we are going to start the movement very 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:58.860
 slowly upwards the movement goes 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:00.930
 to be so slow that it's going to be almost 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.540
 invaluable let's do our 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.970
 normal breathing and in no time 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:09.090
 let's resist the slowness and we 're going 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:11.760
 to anticipate to finish the perfect would be 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:14.520
 It takes 62 minutes to complete the 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:16.260
 full swing we can even 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:18.780
 time to make sure that 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:21.810
 we are going to exhaust all the time and that 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:23.700
 you do too fast as you will see this 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:26.220
 It seems a simple task but requires 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:28.520
 a very high level of concentration and 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.590
 commitment to that rhythm of swing 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:31.880
 It is very important that you will have 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:34.100
 all the sensations that you go 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:36.680
 having a sense of balance in 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:38.840
 the lower part of the body and that 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:41.660
 go feeling like the party 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:44.660
 top everything that is waist 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:48.260
 arms shoulders that are all 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:53.390
 coordinated with the bottom 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:55.459
 once you go finishing the swing 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:57.260
 I recommend that you return to make a 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:59.200
 second attempt with closed eyes if 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:02.180
 you get to know all those feelings 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.799
 this seems so easy 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:05.480
 It is quite complicated and you will give 

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:07.939
 account as I say just at the level of 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:10.069
 pretty high computing 

00:03:07.939 --> 00:03:12.079
 but it's going to be very useful already 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:13.849
 that according to neuroscientific studies 

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:15.650
 and for its particular effects on the 

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:18.469
 brain it is known that connections 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:20.239
 Neuronal associated with a movement so 

00:03:18.469 --> 00:03:21.980
 slow they get stronger and help 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:24.260
 make that movement more accessible in the 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:27.170
 mind also will also help to have 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:29.120
 new sensations about our dream 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:31.549
 to give a perspective in three 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.719
 dimensions about the purpose and for 

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:34.669
 course it will also help us 

00:03:32.719 --> 00:03:37.370
 train the concentration and I think it's 

00:03:34.669 --> 00:03:39.590
 a very simple exercise that you can 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:42.340
 start working to start with 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:42.340
 this mental work 

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:51.230
 because with this we finish today I hope 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:53.390
 that you put this exercise into practice and 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:55.730
 let's start connecting as I say that 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:58.550
 mental part with the purely part 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:00.110
 technique and thank you for your attention and 

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:02.680
 see you next week in Andalusia 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:02.680
