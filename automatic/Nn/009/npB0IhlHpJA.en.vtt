00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:10.480 

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:13.080 

the<00:01:10.960> Venus<00:01:11.320> human<00:01:11.680> trap<00:01:11.980> which<00:01:12.250> is<00:01:12.460> a<00:01:12.640> big

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:13.090 
the Venus human trap which is a big

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:15.930 
the Venus human trap which is a big
giant<00:01:13.750> green<00:01:14.320> plant<00:01:14.800> with<00:01:15.040> huge<00:01:15.370> tentacles

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:15.940 
giant green plant with huge tentacles

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:18.000 
giant green plant with huge tentacles
and<00:01:16.180> it'll<00:01:16.450> pick<00:01:16.720> up<00:01:16.750> cars<00:01:17.230> pick<00:01:17.650> up<00:01:17.800> people

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:18.010 
and it'll pick up cars pick up people

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:23.250 
and it'll pick up cars pick up people
and<00:01:18.250> just<00:01:18.490> eat<00:01:18.760> them<00:01:21.420> it's<00:01:22.420> also<00:01:22.600> interactive

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:23.260 
and just eat them it's also interactive

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.800 
and just eat them it's also interactive
so<00:01:23.500> you<00:01:23.590> can<00:01:23.830> PK<00:01:24.520> a<00:01:24.550> human<00:01:25.000> and<00:01:25.210> bring<00:01:25.480> it<00:01:25.600> near

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:25.810 
so you can PK a human and bring it near

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:27.660 
so you can PK a human and bring it near
a<00:01:25.840> tentacle<00:01:26.320> and<00:01:26.500> the<00:01:26.830> Venus<00:01:27.160> human<00:01:27.370> trap<00:01:27.550> will

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:27.670 
a tentacle and the Venus human trap will

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:32.100 
a tentacle and the Venus human trap will
just<00:01:27.820> grab<00:01:28.120> it<00:01:28.180> right<00:01:28.510> from<00:01:29.220> and<00:01:30.840> one<00:01:31.840> of<00:01:31.960> the
