00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:09.660
 hello guys it's been a week since our last application program 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.680
 and games for ipad and iphone 

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:12.499
 this Monday 

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:16.629
 and we return commune of the selection a selection of acquiring games 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:21.820
 that we consider very common and important that interesting said this 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:24.820
 we start with today's program 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.349
 the success of the leader so everything is unpredictable but the game system 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.750
 what Rovio has created has marked 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.730
 a before and after in mobile games 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:41.130
 how other developers who are creating their version of andy work 

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:41.649
 behrens 

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:46.839
 with every time with more options and point you have starting from the original concept 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.770
 to print awards is the game that copies the andy system but with a theme 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.249
 very different this time 

00:00:55.249 --> 00:00:58.120
 instead of playing with birds and being seen 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:01.520
 we will have to use heavy weapons from medieval times 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:04.330
 to destroy fortresses and castles 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:07.530
 with the objective of eliminating the soldiers that are in it 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:11.800
 swords 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:17.440
 the weapon we use is a great tiraje and nash as the great leader 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:22.420
 however we have something new that is the free choice of ammunition at the time 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.300
 to destroy the objective 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:28.610
 as we advance in levels that we will get new ammunition as 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:29.360
 stones 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.460
 fireballs and so on 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:36.630
 to print or Thursday is not to deceive us a game copied of year provisions but 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.200
 at least try to move forward and that is to solve the concept 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.380
 two 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:54.460
 pes 2012 has just hit the market has done so I started building 'm3' xbox 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:55.590
 presents 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.220
 and other platforms but at this point 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:02.439
 could not be passed from a version for mobile platforms 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:13.340
 konami alanzado pes 2012 for iphone cold ipad a game that sure is going to 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.730
 like any fan of the saga 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:20.319
 although I have some things to improve because considering that it is a 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:25.179
 new version similarities 2000 with c are too many 

00:02:25.179 --> 00:02:26.339
 well, that 

00:02:26.339 --> 00:02:29.179
 3 

00:02:29.179 --> 00:02:34.229
 In the game we have several game modes like show party mode 

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:35.829
 league cup of the uefa 

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:41.319
 and even an all normal training mode in this type of titles what 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:46.529
 least I like is how they said the little difference is that haiti between pes 2012 

00:02:46.529 --> 00:02:50.739
 and last year's version of the game that is practically null 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:55.169
 so maybe pos advised to keep the 2011 version 

00:02:55.169 --> 00:02:56.829
 and try fifa 12 

00:02:56.829 --> 00:02:57.590
 and at least 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:00.590
 if you will be surprised 

00:03:07.999 --> 00:03:12.320
 the applications to watch television live from the iss as the prat 

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:16.590
 they are a real demand and their profile is achieving good results 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:22.939
 I'm not going to cheat you and I'll make it clear that we'll pay to watch TV on it. 

00:03:22.939 --> 00:03:27.590
 as the sponsor because the image quality is good or because it has a very 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:33.049
 Pretty superti ti has been created with haste and its creators adm forgotten to give 

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:37.069
 a little touch of design to the application so do not expect great 

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:37.999
 thing 

00:03:37.999 --> 00:03:41.959
 however the main function ce ce without problems 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:45.989
 with your profile and we can access dozens of channels from different countries 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:49.400
 In my case I am interested in Spanish channels 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:53.569
 and as we see we have a large list of television channels to see 

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:58.699
 the organization of the channels is horrible as well as the theme of the fund 

00:03:58.699 --> 00:04:03.709
 of screen but I already tell you if we click on a vote we will see on television 

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:06.919
 live from the corresponding chain 

00:04:06.919 --> 00:04:11.249
 good application to not miss a program to be and that we like when 

00:04:11.249 --> 00:04:15.789
 lack of television and we have a wi-fi connection within reach 

00:04:15.789 --> 00:04:18.919
 efe 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:25.400
 the other day in our games section we've already advanced some 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:27.180
 Details about health or more 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:31.509
 a game that analysts baptize as the 'lucky day' to 

00:04:31.509 --> 00:04:35.979
 they are not surprised that they have earned this qualification because all the 

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:41.310
 modeling the environments in the weapons the characters and the plot are based on 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:42.189
 respect 

00:04:42.189 --> 00:04:43.909
 oxxo 

00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:48.630
 except one part saw the game but as the games that learning 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:52.440
 are titles that make the apple platform gain a reputation 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:57.810
 this disinterest for ipad and iphone is from my point of view the best game 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:01.940
 from them we could evaluate each section separately and equally 

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:05.180
 we will find the rival mound for some cases 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:09.220
 but usually both the graphic section and the gameplay of the 

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:13.210
 olympus ambience or sound outperform almost any other game 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:14.969
 ahead astor 

00:05:14.969 --> 00:05:19.659
 however the club that continues to miss and Solomon is a system of watch 

00:05:19.659 --> 00:05:22.989
 more innovative than having to use the finger to rotate the view 

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:26.849
 since it makes maneuverability very difficult when we have to 

00:05:26.849 --> 00:05:29.800
 move and shoot at the same time 

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:33.780
 games like 9 millimeters are already starting to use the accelerometer 

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:38.229
 for this task and the truth that is noticeable when we are removing buttons from the 

00:05:38.229 --> 00:05:41.319
 screen and leaving the basic controls 

00:05:41.319 --> 00:05:45.990
 decalogue we can say that the story takes place on a spatial basis and that 

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:49.699
 we have to go eliminating some special in and that was very well armed 

00:05:49.699 --> 00:05:54.169
 We will have different weapons and tools to carry out our 

00:05:54.169 --> 00:05:58.930
 task but the ammunition is over and we must eliminate enemies for 

00:05:58.929 --> 00:06:00.550
 get your way 

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:04.610
 the gameplay is good and the system to sign up dominates after a while 

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:09.860
 of play on the other hand is to say that the system to cover us from the shots 

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:12.070
 enemies is spectacular 

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:15.650
 the form with which we cover ourselves with which we went out to shoot 

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:20.530
 or how we jump over the fences in the template will be incredible if you 

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:25.350
 like the super solomon games for ipad and iphone you will love it because it is 

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:28.350
 one of the best games of the moment 

00:06:29.689 --> 00:06:33.999
 good guys how do you allow at the beginning I think today's selection is more 

00:06:33.999 --> 00:06:34.800
 that's good 

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:39.840
 If you like that program, do not forget to tell your friends from Elche 

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:42.869
 every Monday in configurarequipos dotcom greetings
