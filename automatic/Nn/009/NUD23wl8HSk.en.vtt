00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:10.400
 Well, the determining factor for today is 

00:00:07.399 --> 00:00:13.400
 that good traffic is needed in Siberia 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:18.309
 team and disciplines believe that in these 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:18.309
 components we were height today 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:30.349
 good game important points i want was for 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:33.620
 guys I want to congratulate 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:36.320
 about going to win and thank for 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:40.370
 a compliment because he called two 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:44.719
 component, I think that was not to be questioned 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:47.780
 in all the components on hockey much 

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:50.059
 far superior to you than connected 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:53.510
 you can probably find some excuse 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:55.339
 after such a series to cause not very 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:58.179
 simple but again i say i don't want 

00:00:55.339 --> 00:01:01.730
 look for an excuse we played today 

00:00:58.179 --> 00:01:04.670
 fairly weak as many mistakes as 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:08.659
 committed today especially the middle zone 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:10.840
 defense zone is not remembered so we in 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:15.409
 one match is generally so much 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:17.770
 made mistakes maybe somewhere like that 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:21.229
 know the hype around the team 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:23.869
 this is not entirely to one side all 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:27.490
 nice to read here these are all other articles 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:31.009
 hand a little bit early our tap I already 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:33.189
 appeal to all journalists as the land 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:35.540
 let's finish the season and then you 

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:40.369
 estimate here it is clear 6 some 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:42.560
 intermediate results but damn everything all 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:45.770
 estimated at the end of the season 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:48.289
 And once again on the fact that the game is still concerned 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:50.649
 let's understand that the opponent broke out not 

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:50.649
 great 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:59.860
 disturbed as they prevent your I 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:04.920
 said he is now today 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:07.450
 so big we ourselves prevented 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:13.840
 the team today can hurt it that 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:15.730
 virus sheet team someone no more but 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:19.990
 if you want the truth you can not find there 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:21.880
 a whole bunch of times we are these people who are with 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:23.710
 virus or sick goes to the ice they 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:25.900
 should be responsible for their actions on 

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:28.410
 ice and even if you came out then you should 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:31.600
 play full if you can't play 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:35.170
 heal on going out not going out 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:37.510
 so of course what else 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:40.720
 if you lose you can be mass 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:43.050
 the reasons why I now say to us 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:50.530
 need to sit and think a little too 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:55.180
 deal with well of course this is the leader 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:57.700
 teams is the leader of the first link on the u 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:59.620
 you and us understand the team and us 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:02.739
 the absence of any player affects 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:06.880
 estimate bench yes we have all all the players 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:09.459
 which they will make up thank God for 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:15.780
 1 2 player losses this already affects 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:18.330
 on stony was resolved thanks 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:21.820
 Strelnikova most defenders 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:23.680
 decided to throw a surfer today you 

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:27.120
 squeezed on you no less in bed even 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:30.099
 participation of the protector of the royal family 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:34.430
 contentedly you are playing the wicked 

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:36.409
 example 2 she undoubtedly today 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:39.829
 goal in the minority turned out yes we 

00:03:36.409 --> 00:03:41.659
 did it yourself after 300 modellers and 

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:43.849
 In general, today it happened 

00:03:41.659 --> 00:03:47.060
 there are literally three seconds left 

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:48.859
 there were 2 opportunity to step twice 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:51.530
 we do not get out about any and more 

00:03:48.859 --> 00:03:54.469
 I want to repeat that these questions 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:58.310
 yes game games in the minority 

00:03:54.469 --> 00:04:04.459
 questions on the breed team, on this 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:06.200
 work accent my teeth to andrew 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:08.049
 turned around later stitched to pour 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:11.000
 there are guys at home 

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:14.530
 Alexey Kaigorodov looking for me with players 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:18.859
 not fully recovered but Andrei is 1 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:20.810
 dining pillars our gang so but 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:22.330
 defenders used to score unfortunately 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:24.440
 still forget stalin 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:25.360
 go about your business in 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:29.180
 general major 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:30.110
 I probably would like to note good 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:33.460
 all defender 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:35.300
 well and the attackers then another question from 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:37.479
 everyone says that 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:39.620
 steiner negatively affects repair 

00:04:37.479 --> 00:04:43.789
 mostly physical readiness 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:44.840
 how do you evaluate the impact of this tournament on 

00:04:43.789 --> 00:04:48.650
 the team as he is now 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:51.110
 functional state of the word but necessary 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:54.190
 creates a double impression we arrived 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:56.000
 on this extended two years ago and how 

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:58.310
 approach this tournament 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.880
 we already know and experience on this 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:02.650
 the tournament that collected 

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:05.650
 I think that some of the best European 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:08.620
 teams teams that are reinforced by another 3 

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:13.540
 4 players from other clubs also managed 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:15.490
 this is one of the leaders of the championship and good 

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:18.480
 fast modern hockey and I think 

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:21.100
 for us it is exactly what grows in it and 

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:21.900
 in some period undoubtedly passes 

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:24.100
 when 

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:26.830
 adaptive yes when we come what 

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:30.000
 we had several births in the past 

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:33.370
 at first but if you take 

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:35.500
 probably in the long run from 

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:37.030
 this tournament more pros than cons 

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:39.700
 but I certainly certainly do not 

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:41.380
 try to play more successfully because 

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:44.140
 that we are not sweaters whether a strong team 

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:48.790
 beat and davos beat and beat 

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:50.950
 yokerit beat medveschak well on this 

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:52.300
 tournament know how boring press 

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:54.010
 good mood 

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:55.810
 regarded as a stage of preparation for 

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:57.840
 championship then it goes fine 

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:59.890
 if you just go there I will pass 

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:01.780
 celebrate the new year holidays it 

00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:03.430
 better to celebrate them at home all the more 

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:05.920
 still we are not sure if a certain 

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:08.560
 responsibility khl club which 

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:11.140
 representing how I think the finals 

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:16.990
 there is good enough even good 

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:20.860
 achievement master cook did not return 

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:21.400
 the composition of the past became a solo variety 

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:23.470
 quickly 

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:24.790
 team why is it considered something 

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:28.260
 free steering wheel maxim 

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:31.740
 after strangling the room very loved would go 

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:31.740
 not even without 

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:39.850
 miss pollock 

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:48.580
 if the maximum without comment people 

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:48.580
 the whole team played
