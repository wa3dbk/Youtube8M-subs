00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720 
hi all today I will show you how to make

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.990 
hi all today I will show you how to make
a<00:00:06.750> gradient<00:00:07.140> with<00:00:07.560> a<00:00:07.589> small<00:00:07.919> sponge<00:00:08.280> I've

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
a gradient with a small sponge I've

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.820 
a gradient with a small sponge I've
never<00:00:09.269> tried<00:00:09.540> it<00:00:09.599> before<00:00:09.840> with<00:00:10.230> a<00:00:10.260> sponge<00:00:10.590> but

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
never tried it before with a sponge but

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.480 
never tried it before with a sponge but
it<00:00:10.980> seems<00:00:11.190> like<00:00:11.429> it<00:00:11.580> works<00:00:11.790> pretty<00:00:11.910> well<00:00:12.269> I<00:00:13.490> use

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
it seems like it works pretty well I use

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.369 
it seems like it works pretty well I use
a<00:00:14.519> smooth<00:00:14.880> and<00:00:15.120> airy<00:00:15.330> kind<00:00:15.599> of<00:00:15.809> sponge<00:00:16.109> that

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
a smooth and airy kind of sponge that

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.820 
a smooth and airy kind of sponge that
resists<00:00:16.920> nail<00:00:17.160> polish<00:00:17.640> and<00:00:17.850> remover<00:00:18.330> and<00:00:18.710> I<00:00:19.710> am

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
resists nail polish and remover and I am

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.370 
resists nail polish and remover and I am
using<00:00:20.070> tweezers<00:00:20.640> to<00:00:20.970> dip<00:00:21.119> one<00:00:21.390> corner<00:00:22.020> of<00:00:22.199> the

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
using tweezers to dip one corner of the

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.349 
using tweezers to dip one corner of the
sponge<00:00:22.710> in<00:00:23.010> the<00:00:23.130> nail<00:00:23.250> polish<00:00:23.699> so<00:00:24.000> I<00:00:24.119> don't

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
sponge in the nail polish so I don't

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:25.779 
sponge in the nail polish so I don't
have<00:00:24.539> to<00:00:24.660> do<00:00:24.779> it<00:00:24.869> in<00:00:24.990> my<00:00:25.109> fingers

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:25.789 
have to do it in my fingers

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:28.609 
have to do it in my fingers
then<00:00:26.789> I<00:00:26.820> use<00:00:27.210> the<00:00:27.390> sponge<00:00:27.720> to<00:00:28.080> do<00:00:28.230> the<00:00:28.349> gradient

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
then I use the sponge to do the gradient

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.350 
then I use the sponge to do the gradient
on<00:00:29.039> my<00:00:29.220> nail<00:00:31.250> if<00:00:32.250> you<00:00:32.430> don't<00:00:32.610> press<00:00:32.850> too<00:00:33.030> much

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
on my nail if you don't press too much

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.340 
on my nail if you don't press too much
on<00:00:33.630> it<00:00:33.660> you<00:00:34.500> won't<00:00:34.680> have<00:00:34.829> much<00:00:35.190> of<00:00:35.340> a<00:00:35.430> gradient

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:36.350 
on it you won't have much of a gradient

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:39.319 
on it you won't have much of a gradient
to<00:00:37.350> make<00:00:37.530> a<00:00:37.559> beautiful<00:00:37.890> gradient<00:00:38.850> you<00:00:39.120> should

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
to make a beautiful gradient you should

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.510 
to make a beautiful gradient you should
press<00:00:39.570> hard<00:00:39.930> on<00:00:40.110> it<00:00:40.320> and<00:00:40.469> then<00:00:40.770> put<00:00:40.950> more<00:00:41.340> nail

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
press hard on it and then put more nail

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.850 
press hard on it and then put more nail
polish<00:00:41.940> on<00:00:42.120> your<00:00:42.390> sponge<00:00:42.629> the<00:00:43.320> more<00:00:43.500> you<00:00:43.590> press

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
polish on your sponge the more you press

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.220 
polish on your sponge the more you press
the<00:00:44.280> better<00:00:44.460> graded<00:00:45.059> you'll<00:00:45.239> get<00:00:45.480> because<00:00:45.960> it

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
the better graded you'll get because it

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.200 
the better graded you'll get because it
will<00:00:46.440> take<00:00:46.710> the<00:00:46.890> nail<00:00:47.039> polish<00:00:47.430> of<00:00:47.610> the<00:00:47.879> sponge

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
will take the nail polish of the sponge

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.569 
will take the nail polish of the sponge
you<00:00:48.539> should<00:00:49.200> know<00:00:49.320> that<00:00:49.469> shaded<00:00:49.890> tones<00:00:50.160> done

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
you should know that shaded tones done

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.970 
you should know that shaded tones done
with<00:00:50.820> a<00:00:50.850> sponge<00:00:51.239> dry<00:00:51.690> very<00:00:51.930> fast<00:00:52.320> because<00:00:52.680> it's

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
with a sponge dry very fast because it's

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:59.990 
with a sponge dry very fast because it's
a<00:00:53.070> very<00:00:53.280> thin<00:00:53.579> coat<00:00:53.789> of<00:00:53.850> nail<00:00:54.149> polish

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.240 

let<00:01:01.000> me<00:01:01.150> show<00:01:01.329> you<00:01:01.390> one<00:01:01.690> more<00:01:01.720> time<00:01:02.110> you<00:01:02.440> can<00:01:02.980> of

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:03.250 
let me show you one more time you can of

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:04.920 
let me show you one more time you can of
course<00:01:03.550> make<00:01:03.760> a<00:01:03.820> gradient<00:01:04.150> with<00:01:04.360> several

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:04.930 
course make a gradient with several

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:07.800 
course make a gradient with several
colors<00:01:05.350> you<00:01:05.950> can<00:01:06.100> overlay<00:01:06.610> them<00:01:06.910> for<00:01:07.450> example

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:07.810 
colors you can overlay them for example

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:09.510 
colors you can overlay them for example
to<00:01:07.930> make<00:01:08.050> a<00:01:08.110> gradient<00:01:08.440> you<00:01:08.830> can<00:01:08.979> do<00:01:09.160> it<00:01:09.280> with

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:09.520 
to make a gradient you can do it with

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:18.390 
to make a gradient you can do it with
many<00:01:09.670> colors<00:01:10.120> to<00:01:10.300> obtain<00:01:10.630> a<00:01:10.660> base<00:01:17.280> so<00:01:18.280> I'm

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:18.400 
many colors to obtain a base so I'm

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.390 
many colors to obtain a base so I'm
using<00:01:18.640> three<00:01:18.970> colors<00:01:19.000> here<00:01:19.710> once<00:01:20.710> again<00:01:21.040> I<00:01:21.070> did

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:21.400 
using three colors here once again I did

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.249 
using three colors here once again I did
one<00:01:21.700> side<00:01:21.910> of<00:01:22.060> the<00:01:22.150> sponge<00:01:22.420> in<00:01:22.690> the<00:01:22.780> color<00:01:22.990> and

00:01:23.249 --> 00:01:23.259 
one side of the sponge in the color and

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:33.800 
one side of the sponge in the color and
will<00:01:23.650> use<00:01:23.860> it<00:01:24.070> to<00:01:24.220> make<00:01:24.369> the<00:01:24.520> gradient

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:59.940 

the<00:01:34.810> Queen<00:01:35.020> responds<00:01:35.469> dip<00:01:35.799> it<00:01:35.979> in<00:01:36.219> acetone

00:01:59.940 --> 00:01:59.950 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:02.249
