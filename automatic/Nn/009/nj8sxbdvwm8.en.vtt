00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:16.300 
and now I look like a ghost I'm going to
blend<00:02:10.280> all<00:02:10.670> of<00:02:10.820> it<00:02:10.970> using<00:02:11.300> my<00:02:11.450> ring<00:02:11.660> finger

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:42.729 

I<00:02:40.819> took<00:02:41.330> a<00:02:41.510> little<00:02:41.720> bit<00:02:41.930> of<00:02:42.049> the<00:02:42.170> color<00:02:42.379> tease

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:42.739

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
started blending the eyeshadows together

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:50.110 
started blending the eyeshadows together
so<00:02:48.079> that<00:02:48.230> it<00:02:48.349> looked<00:02:48.620> seamless<00:02:49.310> and<00:02:49.549> then<00:02:50.090> I

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
so that it looked seamless and then I

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.149 
so that it looked seamless and then I
also<00:02:50.540> pulled<00:02:50.930> in<00:02:51.110> a<00:02:51.260> little<00:02:51.530> bit<00:02:51.650> onto<00:02:52.010> the

also pulled in a little bit onto the
outer<00:02:52.430> corners<00:02:52.970> on<00:02:53.209> the<00:02:53.420> bottom<00:02:53.780> lashes<00:02:55.180> so

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 
outer corners on the bottom lashes so

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:58.210 
outer corners on the bottom lashes so
mascara<00:02:56.629> I'm<00:02:56.930> using<00:02:57.099> benefits

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.220 
mascara I'm using benefits

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.539

Adele real mascara it's a waterproof

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:04.149 
Adele real mascara it's a waterproof
formula<00:03:01.549> so<00:03:01.879> it<00:03:02.060> lasts<00:03:02.629> all<00:03:02.840> day<00:03:02.900> long<00:03:03.230> and<00:03:03.739> it

00:03:04.149 --> 00:03:04.159 
formula so it lasts all day long and it

00:03:04.159 --> 00:03:06.190 
formula so it lasts all day long and it
really<00:03:04.670> separates<00:03:05.239> the<00:03:05.480> lashes<00:03:05.690> and

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:06.200 
really separates the lashes and

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.309 
really separates the lashes and
lengthens<00:03:06.859> it<00:03:07.010> and<00:03:07.220> adds<00:03:07.730> tons<00:03:08.390> of<00:03:08.720> volume

00:03:09.309 --> 00:03:09.319 
lengthens it and adds tons of volume

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:11.380 
lengthens it and adds tons of volume

especially when I know I have a long day

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:16.030 
especially when I know I have a long day
ahead<00:03:13.549> and<00:03:13.970> then<00:03:14.659> I'm<00:03:14.900> going<00:03:15.109> to<00:03:15.140> use<00:03:15.440> a<00:03:15.709> B

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:51.970 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:54.150 

it's<00:03:52.510> time<00:03:52.780> to<00:03:52.810> straighten<00:03:53.170> my<00:03:53.500> hair<00:03:53.530> I<00:03:54.130> was

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:54.160 
it's time to straighten my hair I was

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.520 
it's time to straighten my hair I was
just<00:03:54.700> pulling<00:03:54.910> out<00:03:55.180> random<00:03:55.690> sections<00:03:56.320> and

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:56.530 
just pulling out random sections and

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:59.340 
just pulling out random sections and
then<00:03:56.880> straightening<00:03:57.880> it<00:03:58.150> and<00:03:58.390> curling<00:03:58.960> the

00:03:59.340 --> 00:03:59.350 
then straightening it and curling the

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:02.910 
then straightening it and curling the
edges<00:03:59.830> to<00:04:00.460> curl<00:04:00.670> the<00:04:00.880> edge<00:04:01.090> I<00:04:01.570> am<00:04:01.900> just<00:04:02.710> taking

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:02.920 
edges to curl the edge I am just taking

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:05.460 
edges to curl the edge I am just taking
the<00:04:03.220> straightener<00:04:03.670> and<00:04:03.970> rotating<00:04:04.690> it<00:04:04.870> so<00:04:05.260> that

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:05.470 
the straightener and rotating it so that

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:08.010 
the straightener and rotating it so that
you<00:04:05.680> get<00:04:05.890> this<00:04:06.100> soft<00:04:06.460> curl<00:04:06.940> only<00:04:07.570> on<00:04:07.660> the<00:04:07.810> outer

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:08.020 
you get this soft curl only on the outer

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:10.590 
you get this soft curl only on the outer
edge<00:04:08.410> I<00:04:08.710> think<00:04:09.310> it<00:04:09.400> looks<00:04:09.610> really<00:04:09.730> nice<00:04:10.210> and<00:04:10.270> it

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:10.600 
edge I think it looks really nice and it

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:13.470 
edge I think it looks really nice and it
adds<00:04:10.840> a<00:04:11.110> sort<00:04:11.770> of<00:04:11.830> like<00:04:12.100> a<00:04:12.130> volume<00:04:12.550> onto<00:04:13.330> the

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:13.480 
adds a sort of like a volume onto the

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:16.229 
adds a sort of like a volume onto the
ends<00:04:14.050> of<00:04:14.170> my<00:04:14.200> hair<00:04:14.860> instead<00:04:15.430> of<00:04:15.670> this<00:04:15.850> looking

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:16.239 
ends of my hair instead of this looking

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:19.620 
ends of my hair instead of this looking
limp<00:04:17.110> and<00:04:17.500> I<00:04:18.340> don't<00:04:18.489> know<00:04:18.760> weird<00:04:19.060> it<00:04:19.360> looks

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:19.630 
limp and I don't know weird it looks

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:22.260 
limp and I don't know weird it looks
better<00:04:19.840> this<00:04:20.140> way<00:04:20.380> and<00:04:20.680> this<00:04:21.520> is<00:04:21.670> how<00:04:21.790> it<00:04:21.940> looks

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:22.270 
better this way and this is how it looks

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:25.290 
better this way and this is how it looks
then<00:04:23.050> I'm<00:04:23.380> going<00:04:23.680> to<00:04:23.740> take<00:04:24.010> the<00:04:24.580> Moroccan<00:04:25.210> oil

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:25.300 
then I'm going to take the Moroccan oil
