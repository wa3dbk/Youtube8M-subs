00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:20.670
 now it is actually so far up 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:24.150
 you'll jailbreak my channel soon 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:26.880
 see videos reviews et cetera in 4k 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.369
 in addition I here the samsung nx 500 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:32.969
 I think a standard device in 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:35.219
 the 4k industry currently i use this camera 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.500
 I bought myself for you 4k 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.270
 to produce videos and in this 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.620
 video is really just about that 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.280
 unboxing because we'll see each other now 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.410
 just take a look 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.140
 what the package looks like and what it looks like 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.640
 is in the packaging and to 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.210
 First of all, look at the front 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.469
 page on 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.410
 Once upon a time, we have the lettering 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:55.140
 samsung nx 500 the camera pictured this 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.940
 samsung sign around left of the 4k 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.590
 content and then how much 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.170
 megapixel and so on 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.059
 then we have the one side where 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.580
 we do not stand much 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.740
 again the camera pictured and a 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:12.030
 some information the same here too 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:13.680
 and the back he is empty and not 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.540
 especially nice and I think now 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.700
 Let's just unpack it 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.350
 to bake , we have one here 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:23.850
 we can just do that with small glue 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:26.079
 take off and then here the camera 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:29.210
 also open 

00:01:26.079 --> 00:01:33.829
 and that's what we pull on this lax and 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:35.090
 already we can open this here and so 

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:37.670
 then we have two laps here again 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:39.289
 they open as well and look at us 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:41.619
 First, consider that everybody in it so 

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:45.369
 he is just such a small time for me 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:47.710
 Tackle where we probably will 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:50.630
 to find paperwork 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:52.159
 so it looks like we have here first 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:55.429
 user manuals short instructions 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:57.740
 quick start guide and so on 

00:01:55.429 --> 00:02:01.250
 then we have more here 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:03.649
 information and last but not least 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.939
 here warning and so on not so 

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:07.450
 particularly interesting is on 

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:11.239
 mainly just paperwork 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:13.340
 then we have the objective thing here 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:16.310
 directly supplied so is the 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:18.079
 standard kit lens and yes that feels 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:21.650
 in any case, pretty much 

00:02:18.079 --> 00:02:23.239
 valent to not as plastic as me 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.000
 that of my know objective 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:29.030
 at least from the 50 millimeter lens 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.380
 have in memory and there we look 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.329
 maybe later again 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:33.920
 or then in a detailed video 

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:36.980
 more on that later 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:43.639
 then we have even more plastic and 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:45.760
 Here we have a power plug with usb 

00:02:43.639 --> 00:02:45.760
 connection 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:55.170
 nothing and on the left side 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:03:00.670
 then there is already the camera 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:01.989
 and that is really damn small so 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:04.200
 In any case, I have them that way 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:07.359
 not presented is really 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:10.450
 pretty small very compact one 

00:03:07.359 --> 00:03:11.950
 Compact camera just and also the chance 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:12.840
 maybe something again 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:16.060
 more exactly 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:18.510
 in a short overview then we have 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:23.139
 here under this little box 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:25.599
 other accessories and a strap around 

00:03:23.139 --> 00:03:28.590
 then the camera around the neck 

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:38.590
 to hang the shoulder that way too 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:41.189
 also here a usb charging cable and there 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:41.189
 we have here 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:47.079
 here we have the lightning did not quite go 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:49.060
 so easy on but here we have one 

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:51.459
 additional lightning we easily 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:53.409
 I can find that out above 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:55.390
 really cool so we have this one here 

00:03:53.409 --> 00:03:56.799
 have internal flash light but if 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:57.219
 we just need him out 

00:03:56.799 --> 00:04:00.340
 can 

00:03:57.219 --> 00:04:04.780
 we also have it here then 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:07.480
 the battery again in the classic tackled 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:10.180
 and otherwise it would be you see 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:12.040
 the box is empty in any case 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:14.950
 not so much accessories so im 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:16.720
 contrary to my canon eos 650 de da 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:18.340
 Somehow there was something more 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:20.049
 but this is one too 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:22.660
 SLR camera and there was still a lot 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:24.910
 much more paperwork and so on 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:27.099
 and here we also need in the end 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:30.340
 no more than the camera's lens 

00:04:27.099 --> 00:04:32.410
 and of course the battery and then pack 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:34.419
 I first the packaging here for 

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:36.310
 page and we will have a look again 

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:38.259
 Everything was supplied differently here 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:41.169
 also paperwork against the lens 

00:04:38.259 --> 00:04:46.150
 the camera one of the netzstecker friend 

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:48.840
 USB cable also the battery very short 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:48.840
 unpacking 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:58.870
 so he looks out of here then the lightning and 

00:04:56.199 --> 00:05:02.290
 Of course, the shoulder strap we then 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:04.360
 can attach to the camera now 

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:05.919
 just a little bit more precise to the 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:07.630
 Camera I always have the objective now 

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:09.340
 screwed on and here we have the 

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:11.260
 of course we can do it all in one go 

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:13.900
 just put it in and then 

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:17.350
 mooring and, of course, also 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:18.820
 other flashes up here but the stuck 

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:20.440
 I do not now first it the 

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:22.449
 Battery I have set down then pure 

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:23.950
 and there I will be now 

00:05:22.449 --> 00:05:27.490
 insert a sd card I have 

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:31.540
 two 64gb sd cards bought this u 3 

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:34.060
 sdk to be needed for 4k and 

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:37.240
 I am against a 128 gb card 

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:39.610
 decided because I find that annoying 

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:40.090
 if i had a 128gb card 

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:42.520
 loses 

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:43.450
 instead of a 64 gb card and 

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:45.220
 Accordingly, I have easy 

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:47.830
 thought it is the same in the end 

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:49.539
 memory I prefer to pay 23 euros more 

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:50.830
 that you have tasted now you will find 

00:05:49.539 --> 00:05:51.940
 of course and in the video description 

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:54.130
 could even look over 

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:56.229
 and because you have only one SD card 

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:58.690
 at least, that's what I've got myself for 

00:05:56.229 --> 00:06:01.630
 thought so and I put it there now 

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:07.030
 Just get in when I get out of this 

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:10.780
 out and put the sd card in here 

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:13.740
 the camera and next we start 

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:13.740
 the camera just once 

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:19.050
 The first start would have been very much now 

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:20.310
 that you have extra time here 

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:22.590
 and so on can adjust that 

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:25.169
 I 've already done that but the 

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:27.030
 Camera is running and I am working 

00:06:25.169 --> 00:06:30.180
 I'll be with it now the next few days 

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:31.650
 to deal with it a little more precisely 

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:32.939
 will also come to a review 

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:34.560
 but not on my channel 

00:06:32.939 --> 00:06:36.569
 but on the channel of all you need 

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:37.889
 you're welcome to stop by and 

00:06:36.569 --> 00:06:39.780
 maybe also leave an abo 

00:06:37.889 --> 00:06:41.729
 I'll put the channel in the video 

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:43.830
 description because these have me to 

00:06:41.729 --> 00:06:45.599
 Part of the camera provided 

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:46.020
 so that I turn the 4k videos for you 

00:06:45.599 --> 00:06:48.389
 can 

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:49.740
 there was a small cooperation and 

00:06:48.389 --> 00:06:51.539
 that's why my channel is coming now 

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:54.240
 the unboxing and on the channel 

00:06:51.539 --> 00:06:55.500
 the video I'm going to shoot and 

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:58.259
 Accordingly, you are welcome once 

00:06:55.500 --> 00:07:01.530
 drop by if you like this video too 

00:06:58.259 --> 00:07:03.090
 the samsung nx 500 should be interested 

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:04.430
 then I thank you for this 

00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:07.259
 I hope you look forward to it 

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:08.879

 again until then makes fine 

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:40.700
 but
