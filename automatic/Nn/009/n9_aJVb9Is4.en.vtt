00:00:00.719 --> 00:00:04.830
 why some people start with letters associating the wisdom of the 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:05.470
 mass 

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:09.559
 and how booming oceans conquer this is the final battle in Swedish 

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:12.559
 this week's science news 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:21.620
 Canadian researchers have 4,000 pieces of amber and the end of one 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:24.849
 Dinosaur Era viewed in search of Veere 

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:26.419
 they lived 11 

00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:30.299
 why is the congealed heart of conifers and in the base against the 

00:00:30.299 --> 00:00:34.519
 Four millions millions of years ago, the four are very different 

00:00:34.519 --> 00:00:36.719
 they could be birds 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.420
 but the researchers rather think that was for teenagers that would not be 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:41.760
 could fly 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.610
 thanks to the newest of the springs 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:46.850
 in any case, it becomes a bit clear to what extent in evolution 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:48.190
 Have originated 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:51.360
 groups are often much smarter than individuals 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.640
 new research shows that and individual often makes major mistakes as in 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.990
 to estimate because candies are again a glass jar 

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:03.260
 the average of all estimates is again very accurate and that average 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:04.540
 estimate is the best 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:07.310
 if people have no knowledge of each other shock 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:12.500
 in the cr z less and less traffic jams and more ailment that is strange because jellyfish are 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.020
 not nearly as good at catching plankton as hunting fish 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.390
 they just hang on to us what's up with their tentacles until something comes to an end 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:23.140
 yet they are ultimately as efficient as the fish 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:25.680
 researchers have now calculated this 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.190
 because they themselves consume so little energy, the jellyfish have 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:30.950
 much less chain 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:33.600
 and therefore ten ailments can take the place of, for example 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:34.770
 energy 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.770
 the oceans are therefore becoming increasingly full 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:44.050
 some people may have captured title colors 16 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:46.610
 we sometimes call this phenomenon ten discussions 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:50.220
 That said Van Leeuwen was awarded a PhD by the Thunder Institute for research 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.100
 the brain processes the stock markets knew themselves 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.560
 she herself is also synestheten and I am now in charge day ticket office hello hello 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.810
 can you briefly explain what he misses is he is 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.810
 year sign up culinaria you parker specifically it stimulates observers 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:07.850
 for example a certain nice life euro 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:09.609
 also dive off the crack 

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:13.279
 then there is always the extra value and more so the shrinkage in the case of 

00:02:13.279 --> 00:02:17.180
 nice and cozy and you deserve a color and the way it even became 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.779
 an aesthetic experiences from a few examples 

00:02:19.779 --> 00:02:24.639
 yes i know you an investor comment color all day per week actors 

00:02:24.639 --> 00:02:28.819
 complainers happened to be black on Fridays but how to implement it he got there 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:32.359
 a few local there are five people registered musical notes 

00:02:32.359 --> 00:02:36.110
 we are a very bizarre person, it is very difficult to imagine 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:39.810
 but those letters you have researched among others how you have it 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.029
 done 

00:02:41.029 --> 00:02:45.189
 but now we notice with kemp and green left what exactly is with airshow 

00:02:45.189 --> 00:02:46.299
 happened around partner 

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:48.559
 no the audience at their age 

00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:52.039
 so knowing very nice and nice in the kennedy is not on one 

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:52.879
 horse 

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:57.019
 and that he did not and looked at which medicines and changed 

00:02:57.019 --> 00:02:59.939
 activity I see for the letters that quietly become world keeper 

00:02:59.939 --> 00:03:04.029
 one of equipment 3 in a network of areas that were important to them 

00:03:04.029 --> 00:03:07.989
 some clumsy song standing in line involved about integration area 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:10.719
 on to the different types and tastes director must also 

00:03:10.719 --> 00:03:15.159
 coming in that is why he also proved to be an important sailing route 

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:19.020
 experienced anp the color must come to be connected say yes 

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:22.279
 and how exactly does that work with the little girl 

00:03:22.279 --> 00:03:24.199
 refuse color 

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:27.829
 to the golden palm and handling times the yellow color church on a paper 

00:03:28.609 --> 00:03:31.819
 that was really normal as well as seeing the colors 

00:03:32.399 --> 00:03:36.049
 and some people experience the kernel association so they think he's with the 

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:39.489
 hottest some more but you can see that barbara did not really show itself 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:40.559
 a statement 

00:03:40.559 --> 00:03:44.279
 if it's on the list however the paper chemistry plans I find it a very 

00:03:44.279 --> 00:03:48.249
 experience then in a pit the brand becomes your profession again which is more important than 

00:03:48.249 --> 00:03:52.169
 you can be the first bright person and active and then the message is created 

00:03:52.169 --> 00:03:56.259
 top forwarded to the area you can combine what information we can give 

00:03:56.259 --> 00:04:00.039
 take mr nice thick afterparty association vineyards tactical anderson 

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:04.069
 so get received support to get life but returns to 

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:08.069
 integration area the ball then the neat pintje must be activated 

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:12.260
 actually also goes so well when J in the world of occasions airport 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:13.529
 it sometimes seemed like something 

00:04:13.529 --> 00:04:17.469
 jelle cooper while the red balls predict, for example, yes and that 

00:04:17.469 --> 00:04:21.579
 We can now actually go with your research then you then off 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:23.379
 Yes please 

00:04:23.379 --> 00:04:27.210
 according to him, the first in my research is a quarter of the turnover carmen 

00:04:27.209 --> 00:04:30.589
 apparently also with other investing eva it is more important what order there is 

00:04:30.589 --> 00:04:31.469
 are areas 

00:04:31.469 --> 00:04:35.149
 to be active apparently difficult to perceive I have your kiev and 

00:04:35.149 --> 00:04:36.420
 insulting the ing 

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:39.680
 that brought along the conclusion from our research 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:41.809
 it now looks like night vision 

00:04:41.809 --> 00:04:46.049
 network site no idea have problems accommodations on different details 

00:04:46.049 --> 00:04:49.639
 to see a picture of top sport also see a face 

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:52.949
 made much more often than they have trouble getting a whole in csi 

00:04:53.449 --> 00:04:56.850
 and that did not work and he has a much better tendency with a latin tendency 

00:04:56.849 --> 00:04:58.719
 to link things together 

00:04:58.719 --> 00:05:02.099
 He actually walked around and watched both groups how they sort this out 

00:05:02.099 --> 00:05:05.899
 problems with nagging solving the perception there I am unable to 

00:05:05.899 --> 00:05:09.369
 say about the michelin stars this means you work better and that couple 

00:05:09.369 --> 00:05:12.369
 people with schizophrenia work less well okay thank you for the 

00:05:12.369 --> 00:05:15.260
 Explanations Success With Research Further Testing Lions 

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:18.260
 which term 

00:05:21.099 --> 00:05:24.119
 and what else happened this week in the world of science 

00:05:25.349 --> 00:05:28.819
 American researchers have discovered what changes in the heart after it 

00:05:28.819 --> 00:05:33.699
 placement of a certain species these weeks the cnv with that knowledge they can 

00:05:33.699 --> 00:05:36.699
 maybe in the future just develop drugs against heart failure 

00:05:37.969 --> 00:05:42.020
 musicians experience fewer hearing problems at a later age and then 

00:05:42.019 --> 00:05:45.129
 not musicians the ability of early music 

00:05:45.129 --> 00:05:48.689
 see to follow conversations in a noisy environment is a lot 

00:05:48.689 --> 00:05:53.089
 bigger according to the researchers and father the musicians, moreover, only twenty years 

00:05:53.089 --> 00:05:56.939
 later the same hearing problems as the people who never and instruments 

00:05:56.939 --> 00:05:58.639
 handed over 

00:05:58.639 --> 00:06:00.960
 crows can postpone a reward 

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:04.880
 that is very remarkable because most animals are impulsive he responded 

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:06.689
 directly on the situation 

00:06:06.689 --> 00:06:10.199
 During a new investigation, the cabinet found that Thursday to 

00:06:10.199 --> 00:06:12.860
 ask attention for a nice piece 

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:15.129
 this is similar to hijacking behavior 

00:06:15.129 --> 00:06:18.129
 those of all animals and closest to the people 

00:06:20.279 --> 00:06:22.960
 and now into this news from space 

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:26.319
 in his speech in films it is a cliché but in real life it is there 

00:06:26.319 --> 00:06:27.139
 first 

00:06:27.139 --> 00:06:30.369
 and a planet was discovered usually hit the sky 

00:06:30.369 --> 00:06:32.259
 the yellow and a red one 

00:06:32.259 --> 00:06:35.469
 the two would run 41 days around each other 

00:06:35.469 --> 00:06:39.779
 and the planets' atmosphere surrounds it in 229 days 

00:06:39.779 --> 00:06:42.020
 it can look a bit like set tennis 

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:45.020
 and has been discovered by NASA's Kempenaar Space Telescope 

00:06:46.189 --> 00:06:49.559
 this is an animation of the rockets that the people must go to march 

00:06:50.219 --> 00:06:54.209
 this new launcher itself has more power than the heaviest rockets boyd 

00:06:54.209 --> 00:06:56.360
 the set of tennis 5 

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:59.729
 the church must ultimately be able to carry more than 143 tons of cargo 

00:07:00.569 --> 00:07:03.009
 three times as much as the space shuttle 

00:07:03.009 --> 00:07:06.089
 as fuel directly in oxygen and liquid hydrogen 

00:07:06.689 --> 00:07:09.879
 the first test is planned for the end of 2017 

00:07:09.879 --> 00:07:12.990
 and nasa wants the first man on the moon in 2030 

00:07:13.539 --> 00:07:16.039
 just like his bottle can claim to be Monday
