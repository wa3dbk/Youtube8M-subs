00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:09.469
 spectacular victory of betis football 

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:11.320
 in the cathedral before the athletic club of 

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:14.629
 Bilbao in a match of many absences 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:17.270
 and important absences for the whole 

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:19.630
 Bilbao out of the call 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:23.610
 fernando llorente and javi martínez 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:25.920
 injured muniáin amorebieta 

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:27.900
 the athletic one of then put courage to 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.460
 a game that was very much against him 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.960
 with a 0 to 3 in the first period to 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.820
 despite everything the first great occasion of 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.210
 I find this ball that tries 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:38.580
 chop mikel san jose and that just 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.010
 catching the goalkeeper Fabricio a 

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:43.710
 betis that was very effective in the first 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.079
 period and the first play 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.720
 at minute 7 first arrival at the area 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.940
 of beñat 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:52.900
 who delivers the ball to rubén castro 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:52.900
 which ends by marking 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:00.940
 the 0 to 1 there we see the action of peña 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:00.940
 how do you get 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:05.150
 get rid of the pressure of 

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:07.190
 iturraspe delivers to rubén castro which is 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:09.110
 the player in charge of marking that 0 to 1 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:12.640
 he put himself ahead on the scoreboard 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.640
 invasive betis 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.689
 bielsa very calm in this match and 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:22.730
 the bético picture that tried 

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:24.970
 constantly backlash surprise 

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:27.490
 to the set 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:29.020
 In Bilbao we see amorebieta and 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:30.670
 muniáin as we said players 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:35.040
 important ones that were left out by 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:37.980
 injury in this match had to 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:40.830
 leave the injured encounter ander 

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:42.960
 iturraspe and was replaced by íñigo 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:47.870
 ruiz de galarreta the young player of 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.870
 lezama and the betis that got the 0 to 2 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:55.680
 at minute 26 jorge molina 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:58.140
 in an action very similar to 1 to 0 see 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.510
 very fast action again from betis that 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.300
 he was getting 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:04.690
 with this advantage ahead in the 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:04.690
 marker 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.780
 from 0 to 2 had had until then 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:13.580
 very much the ball the athletic of 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.580
 bilbao but do not 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:20.450
 It did not work because the Betis still 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:23.150
 would score a third goal in this action on 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:25.700
 that ends is beñat that had already been 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:28.360
 important in the two other goals and this 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:31.510
 time it was he who closed 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:35.790
 the first half with this 0 to 3 very 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:35.790
 worrying for the athletic of bilbao 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:44.160
 touched possession or possessions of up to one 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:46.350
 70% Bilbao team with many people 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:49.950
 young on the field by the absences and 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:53.330
 with touch as a reference in attack 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:55.370
 Done touch has this action 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:57.620
 was the second one that did appear 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:00.170
 courage of the lions to get 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:02.959
 tie the match another touch 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:08.170
 a mess is made there gaizka toquero al 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:10.060
 try to get that ball and in the end 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:11.290
 the ball ends up losing by line of 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:13.540
 background 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:16.930
 in the rest, nobody could do much 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:19.580
 least predict a second half 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:21.200
 exciting with that 0 to 3 the 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:23.630
 amateurs who in the end if 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:25.970
 they smiled but it is true that 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:26.930
 the athletic Bilbao with this first 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:29.480
 action already of the party 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:32.450
 in his second time frames with the 1 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:35.810
 to 3 with the first of the inhabitants of Bilbao 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:37.640
 2 the betis' hobby could maybe 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:41.450
 think that the thing was not done 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:42.920
 there was still a lot left and he turned around 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:44.950
 the athletic club of bilbao in the 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:48.010
 Fabricio goal 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:50.410
 and stopped ball is where he found the 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:52.780
 key to the other two goals with 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:56.830
 identical protagonist 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:04:00.650
 mikel san jose finishing for 2 to 3 

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:03.650
 in the 21st minute header 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:03.650
 overwhelming 

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:11.990
 bad exit of fabricio and on the other 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:13.790
 side in the 31st minute tie to three 

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:15.710
 amazing what the athletic had done 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:18.400
 what about the engraving that he had 

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:18.400
 tie the game 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:22.730
 there was a quarter of an hour 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:31.360
 and the set of exams I had 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:33.520
 minutes ahead to find the 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:35.180
 victory but when worse was the 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:37.880
 betis arrived 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:41.180
 3 to 4 that closed the game or at least 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:42.949
 He left the people of Pozuelo very touched 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:45.289
 that just entered alternate in the game 

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:46.639
 Alejandro Pozuelo receives a ball from 

00:04:45.289 --> 00:04:49.430
 another game that had also entered 

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:53.330
 reeds here we see it in this bad clearance 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:55.699
 of the Bilbao defense and in the 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:57.500
 front of the small area almost tops 

00:04:55.699 --> 00:05:00.590
 pleasure catching the 

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:03.910
 goalkeeper gorka iráizoz was 3 to 4 

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:03.910
 but to finish finishing the job 

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:11.300
 jorge molina would score 3 to 5 

00:05:08.219 --> 00:05:14.309
 spectacular the betis reacting as 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:16.259
 a great team like a big one in a 

00:05:14.309 --> 00:05:18.689
 difficult field as is the cathedral there is no 

00:05:16.259 --> 00:05:20.189
 out of the game and we see how it starts in 

00:05:18.689 --> 00:05:23.400
 correct position and how well the 

00:05:20.189 --> 00:05:25.500
 jorge molina ball to score 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:26.880
 3 to 5 and his second goal in this 

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:28.830
 match at the end great historic victory 

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:33.050
 betis victory in san mamés athletic 

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:33.050
 3 betis club 5
