00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:03.000 
hey guys this is Austin its DeMuth video

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.579 
hey guys this is Austin its DeMuth video
going<00:00:03.210> over<00:00:03.300> some<00:00:03.540> of<00:00:03.629> my<00:00:03.659> reasons<00:00:04.200> on<00:00:04.350> why<00:00:04.380> you

00:00:04.579 --> 00:00:04.589 
going over some of my reasons on why you

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:06.380 
going over some of my reasons on why you
should<00:00:04.770> get<00:00:04.830> an<00:00:04.950> SSD<00:00:05.220> so<00:00:06.150> if<00:00:06.210> you've<00:00:06.330> been

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:06.390 
should get an SSD so if you've been

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:07.610 
should get an SSD so if you've been
watching<00:00:06.569> the<00:00:06.810> channel<00:00:07.080> for<00:00:07.200> any<00:00:07.290> length<00:00:07.529> of

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620 
watching the channel for any length of

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.070 
watching the channel for any length of
time<00:00:07.680> you<00:00:08.040> know<00:00:08.189> I<00:00:08.220> love<00:00:08.610> SSDs<00:00:09.179> they<00:00:09.660> just<00:00:09.929> make

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
time you know I love SSDs they just make

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.410 
time you know I love SSDs they just make
everything<00:00:10.469> better

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:11.420 
everything better

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:14.990 
everything better
it<00:00:12.420> ranges<00:00:12.809> but<00:00:13.710> anyway<00:00:14.040> they<00:00:14.429> are<00:00:14.670> really

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
it ranges but anyway they are really

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.580 
it ranges but anyway they are really
really<00:00:15.240> good<00:00:15.420> and<00:00:15.719> there<00:00:16.170> are<00:00:16.260> a<00:00:16.320> bunch<00:00:16.529> of

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
really good and there are a bunch of

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.439 
really good and there are a bunch of
reasons<00:00:16.890> why<00:00:17.160> you<00:00:17.220> should<00:00:17.609> have<00:00:17.850> an<00:00:17.970> SSD<00:00:18.300> on

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
reasons why you should have an SSD on

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.150 
reasons why you should have an SSD on
your<00:00:18.630> computer<00:00:19.109> if<00:00:19.380> you<00:00:19.529> look<00:00:19.680> at<00:00:19.770> computers

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
your computer if you look at computers

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.920 
your computer if you look at computers
today<00:00:20.310> almost<00:00:20.850> everyone<00:00:21.240> is<00:00:21.359> moving<00:00:21.510> toward

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
today almost everyone is moving toward

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.200 
today almost everyone is moving toward
SSDs<00:00:22.500> so<00:00:23.130> take<00:00:23.279> for<00:00:23.369> example<00:00:23.430> the<00:00:23.850> MacBook<00:00:24.180> Air

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
SSDs so take for example the MacBook Air

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.000 
SSDs so take for example the MacBook Air
and<00:00:24.539> the<00:00:24.570> MacBook<00:00:24.779> Pro<00:00:25.170> both<00:00:25.560> of<00:00:25.710> these<00:00:25.800> now

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
and the MacBook Pro both of these now

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.400 
and the MacBook Pro both of these now
only<00:00:26.279> come<00:00:26.640> with<00:00:26.820> an<00:00:26.939> SSD<00:00:27.240> same<00:00:28.140> thing<00:00:28.289> goes

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
only come with an SSD same thing goes

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:29.900 
only come with an SSD same thing goes
for<00:00:28.439> Windows<00:00:28.890> ultrabooks<00:00:29.460> you're<00:00:29.670> pretty

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
for Windows ultrabooks you're pretty

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.279 
for Windows ultrabooks you're pretty
much<00:00:29.970> always<00:00:30.119> going<00:00:30.449> to<00:00:30.630> find<00:00:30.810> they're<00:00:31.109> going

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
much always going to find they're going

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:32.930 
much always going to find they're going
to<00:00:31.380> come<00:00:31.500> with<00:00:31.590> an<00:00:31.740> SSD<00:00:32.070> as<00:00:32.489> opposed<00:00:32.790> to<00:00:32.850> a

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
to come with an SSD as opposed to a

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.700 
to come with an SSD as opposed to a
normal<00:00:33.270> hard<00:00:33.420> drive<00:00:33.660> but<00:00:33.989> before<00:00:34.320> we<00:00:34.380> get<00:00:34.500> into

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
normal hard drive but before we get into

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.380 
normal hard drive but before we get into
all<00:00:34.829> the<00:00:35.010> reasons<00:00:35.040> why<00:00:35.460> why<00:00:35.820> we<00:00:35.969> just<00:00:36.090> take<00:00:36.329> a

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
all the reasons why why we just take a

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.380 
all the reasons why why we just take a
look<00:00:36.540> at<00:00:36.630> what<00:00:36.840> exactly<00:00:37.290> an<00:00:37.350> SSD<00:00:37.739> is<00:00:38.270> SSD<00:00:39.270> is

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
look at what exactly an SSD is SSD is

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.660 
look at what exactly an SSD is SSD is
short<00:00:39.660> for<00:00:39.840> a<00:00:39.870> solid-state<00:00:40.440> drive<00:00:40.469> and<00:00:41.190> this

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
short for a solid-state drive and this

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.160 
short for a solid-state drive and this
is<00:00:41.820> another<00:00:42.090> type<00:00:42.210> of<00:00:42.540> hard<00:00:42.719> drive<00:00:42.960> your

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
is another type of hard drive your

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.540 
is another type of hard drive your
computer<00:00:43.500> sees<00:00:43.649> at<00:00:43.800> the<00:00:43.890> exact<00:00:44.160> same<00:00:44.340> way

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
computer sees at the exact same way

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.340 
computer sees at the exact same way
however<00:00:45.030> it<00:00:45.300> functions<00:00:45.660> in<00:00:45.780> a<00:00:45.840> very<00:00:46.050> different

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
however it functions in a very different

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:47.930 
however it functions in a very different
way<00:00:46.469> more<00:00:46.950> likely<00:00:47.280> the<00:00:47.430> computer<00:00:47.820> you're

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
way more likely the computer you're

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.430 
way more likely the computer you're
using<00:00:47.969> to<00:00:48.329> watch<00:00:48.480> this<00:00:48.629> video<00:00:48.899> right<00:00:49.050> now<00:00:49.079> is

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
using to watch this video right now is

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.470 
using to watch this video right now is
using<00:00:49.590> a<00:00:49.800> mechanical<00:00:50.340> hard<00:00:50.520> drive<00:00:50.760> now<00:00:51.300> this

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
using a mechanical hard drive now this

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.209 
using a mechanical hard drive now this
is<00:00:51.660> basically<00:00:51.930> a<00:00:52.050> series<00:00:52.260> of<00:00:52.379> platters<00:00:52.710> almost

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
is basically a series of platters almost

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.610 
is basically a series of platters almost
like<00:00:53.399> a<00:00:53.430> DVD<00:00:53.879> although<00:00:54.329> not<00:00:54.570> really<00:00:54.780> but<00:00:55.170> it

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
like a DVD although not really but it

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.170 
like a DVD although not really but it
has<00:00:55.860> a<00:00:55.890> little<00:00:56.100> on<00:00:56.309> that<00:00:56.340> will<00:00:56.610> read<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:56.969> data

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
has a little on that will read the data

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.360 
has a little on that will read the data
off<00:00:57.390> of<00:00:57.570> the<00:00:57.690> disk<00:00:57.930> now<00:00:58.500> this<00:00:58.739> is<00:00:58.890> great<00:00:59.070> they

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
off of the disk now this is great they

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:00.860 
off of the disk now this is great they
have<00:00:59.489> lots<00:00:59.760> of<00:00:59.879> storage<00:01:00.180> and<00:01:00.510> hard<00:01:00.660> drives

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
have lots of storage and hard drives

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.209 
have lots of storage and hard drives
have<00:01:00.960> been<00:01:01.020> around<00:01:01.289> for<00:01:01.530> a<00:01:01.559> very<00:01:01.920> very<00:01:02.010> long

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
have been around for a very very long

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.369 
have been around for a very very long
time<00:01:02.399> you<00:01:03.030> take<00:01:03.210> a<00:01:03.239> look<00:01:03.329> at<00:01:03.449> an<00:01:03.539> SSD<00:01:03.870> you'll

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
time you take a look at an SSD you'll

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:05.570 
time you take a look at an SSD you'll
see<00:01:04.500> this<00:01:04.619> is<00:01:04.710> just<00:01:04.860> a<00:01:04.949> series<00:01:05.250> of<00:01:05.309> flash

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
see this is just a series of flash

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.490 
see this is just a series of flash
memory<00:01:05.939> chips<00:01:06.210> this<00:01:06.780> is<00:01:06.900> the<00:01:06.990> very<00:01:07.229> similar

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
memory chips this is the very similar

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.410 
memory chips this is the very similar
stuff<00:01:07.770> to<00:01:07.979> what<00:01:08.100> you<00:01:08.189> will<00:01:08.310> find<00:01:08.549> in<00:01:08.790> an<00:01:08.880> iPhone

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
stuff to what you will find in an iPhone

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.020 
stuff to what you will find in an iPhone
and<00:01:09.750> iPad<00:01:10.470> even<00:01:10.740> in<00:01:11.040> an<00:01:11.159> SD<00:01:11.520> card<00:01:11.549> for<00:01:11.909> your

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
and iPad even in an SD card for your

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.550 
and iPad even in an SD card for your
camera<00:01:12.270> probably<00:01:12.720> the<00:01:12.900> biggest<00:01:13.049> reason<00:01:13.290> to<00:01:13.470> go

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
camera probably the biggest reason to go

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.560 
camera probably the biggest reason to go
with<00:01:13.680> an<00:01:13.770> SSD<00:01:14.040> is<00:01:14.280> because<00:01:14.580> of<00:01:14.670> the<00:01:14.760> speed<00:01:15.090> an

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
with an SSD is because of the speed an

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:16.820 
with an SSD is because of the speed an
SSD<00:01:15.900> will<00:01:16.200> be<00:01:16.290> able<00:01:16.409> to<00:01:16.500> boot<00:01:16.650> your<00:01:16.799> computer

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.940 
for Photoshop to open and since there
are<00:01:24.299> no<00:01:24.420> moving<00:01:24.600> parts<00:01:24.720> in<00:01:25.049> an<00:01:25.140> SSD<00:01:25.439> that<00:01:25.799> means

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
are no moving parts in an SSD that means

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:26.899 
are no moving parts in an SSD that means
it<00:01:26.070> is<00:01:26.189> going<00:01:26.310> to<00:01:26.460> be<00:01:26.549> generally<00:01:26.880> more

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
it is going to be generally more

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.700 
it is going to be generally more
reliable<00:01:27.570> so<00:01:27.990> for<00:01:28.080> example<00:01:28.380> if<00:01:28.470> you<00:01:28.560> have<00:01:28.680> a

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
reliable so for example if you have a

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.530 
reliable so for example if you have a
laptop<00:01:28.950> with<00:01:29.220> a<00:01:29.400> normal<00:01:29.820> spinning<00:01:30.150> hard<00:01:30.329> drive

right now if you drop it or shake it
around<00:01:32.490> there's<00:01:32.970> a<00:01:33.000> very<00:01:33.180> good<00:01:33.299> chance<00:01:33.479> that

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
around there's a very good chance that

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.330 
around there's a very good chance that
something<00:01:34.049> could<00:01:34.079> happen<00:01:34.439> and<00:01:34.770> you<00:01:35.100> could

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
something could happen and you could

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:36.830 
something could happen and you could

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400

little bit more pricey however

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.389 
little bit more pricey however
especially<00:02:04.290> if<00:02:04.560> you're<00:02:04.680> using<00:02:04.829> a<00:02:04.979> Mac<00:02:05.189> I<00:02:05.340> think

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
especially if you're using a Mac I think

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:06.380

it's<00:02:05.670> really<00:02:05.820> worth<00:02:06.030> it

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390
