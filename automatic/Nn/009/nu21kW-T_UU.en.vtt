00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:04.910
Are you looking for the best antivirus in
2015 for Windows 8 or Windows 8.1 or Windows

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:06.040
7 or Windows 10?

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:07.040
You’re in the right spot.

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:16.930
We’re going to go over the top three best
antivirus applications for your Windows computer.

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:19.699
And before we get into the list I just want
to quickly mention that everything that we

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:23.599
talk about, all the links to all the antivirus
programs and other tools that I talk about,

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:27.310
will be in a blog post on my website and the
link to that will be right in the description

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:30.982
below so check that out so you can get the
links to all these programs and find the one

00:00:30.982 --> 00:00:31.982
that's best for you.

00:00:31.982 --> 00:00:37.020
So let's kick off this list at number one,
and this is actually not a antivirus software

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:42.420
but it's actually anti-malware and it is called
Malwarebytes and it goes great alongside any

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:43.420
other antivirus.

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:46.970
So it's something that I think every Windows
user should have on their machine.

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:52.030
Malwarebytes is a great second line of defense
so it catches stuff that your antivirus typically

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:54.390
wouldn't catch or gets by your antivirus.

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.210
So it'll catch adware, spyware, root kits,
trojan horses, all that bad stuff, all that

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:00.670
malware.

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:03.620
It catches that, does a great job at finding
that and removing that.

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:05.510
So it's just awesome to have.

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:06.960
Download this and install this.

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.100
Make sure you have this on your computer at
all times.

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.260
The free version works as an on-demand scanner
so you’ll have to scan it on demand if you’re

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:16.850
using the free version, but it almost always
detects infection if you have it on your PC.

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:20.120
And if you want real-time protection with
Malwarebytes you can upgrade to the premium

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:24.000
version for like $25 so, but the free version
is awesome.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.770
And I think everyone should have that installed
on your system.

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:28.460
So definitely install that.

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:33.540
Now let's get into my favorite antivirus software
out of the next two that I’m going to talk

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:34.540
about.

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:38.060
This is my favorite and it’s the best in
my opinion and it's BitDefender antivirus

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:39.060
free edition.

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.700
And the reason why I like this the best is
because it's lightweight.

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.240
It will not slow down your computer.

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:45.240
It doesn't bog down your system.

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.130
It doesn't use a lot of your computers resources
so it just sits there in the taskbar, it’s

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.130
quiet.

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:55.520
It does its thing, but it also keeps you protected
because the antivirus engine and the database

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.979
that it has is one of the best out there for
all antiviruses.

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.930
It’s consistently ranking amongst the top
antiviruses when these security companies

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:08.170
do side-by-side test comparisons BitDefender
is almost always at the top of those lists

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:11.900
so it definitely does a great job at keeping
your system protected.

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.349
It has real-time protection and it's really
unobtrusive.

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:16.860
That's one thing I like about this.

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:17.860
It’s quiet.

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:19.760
That's all it is is that little box right
there.

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.349
It has a virus shield which is the real-time
protection and it has the auto scan feature

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:27.650
and it scans when your system is idle so it
doesn't like I said it doesn't slow down your

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:28.650
computer.

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:33.430
That's why I recommend BitDefender the free
edition because of those factors, and almost

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:35.329
everybody can get by with the free edition.

00:02:35.329 --> 00:02:40.170
So if you have BitDefender free antivirus
paired along with the free Malwarebytes then

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:41.239
you’re pretty much good to go.

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:43.749
That's all you need and you can feel protected
with that.

00:02:43.749 --> 00:02:48.450
But if you are a little bit less tech savvy
or you’re not as knowledgeable when it comes

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:52.900
to computers or you don't know much about
safe home computing or safe web browsing and

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.579
you just want that extra protection.

00:02:55.579 --> 00:02:58.959
BitDefender does offer the premium version
so if you want to pay for it.

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:02.659
And you’re just that type of person who
just wants that peace of mind and pay for

00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:08.480
it they do offer one of the best premium antiviruses
which is the BitDefender Total Security 2015

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:14.019
so but like I said almost everybody can get
by and be protected with just the free version

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:17.659
and you know the basics of safe web browsing
and safe computing.

00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:22.480
So BitDefender’s my favorite but actually
closing out this list at number three is Avast.

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:27.349
Avast is a fantastic free antivirus and a
lot of people swear by it.

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:32.510
I personally don't use it because I think
it's just a little bit too obtrusive and annoying.

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:35.559
It has these pop-ups and these noises by default.

00:03:35.559 --> 00:03:40.930
You can turn those off but it uses up a little
more system resources than I like compared

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:43.239
to BitDefender, because BitDefender is just
quiet.

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:45.739
It’s got that little box in the bottom right.

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:46.930
It updates by itself.

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:50.909
It’s quiet, but at its core as an antivirus
Avast is fantastic.

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:56.680
It’s one of the best, one of the most popular
free antivirus out there and a lot of people

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:57.680
use this.

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:01.620
So Avast is definitely one of the best and
it’s something to check out.

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:05.590
For me personally like I said I prefer BitDefender
over Avast.

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:10.790
So those are my top three best antivirus applications
in 2015 for your Windows computer if you’re

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:16.700
on Windows 8, Windows 8.1, Windows 7, all
of these are great options for you to stay

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:17.700
protected.

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:21.879
And again my recommended setup is Malwarebytes
along with BitDefender.

00:04:21.879 --> 00:04:23.770
If you have those two you’ll be good to
go.

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:25.110
You won’t have to worry about much.

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:28.289
And make sure you check out my blog post that
goes along to this video where I’ll have

00:04:28.289 --> 00:04:31.940
all the links to everything, and make sure
you like this video and subscribe if you haven't

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:32.940
already.

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:34.440
I do tech videos every single week.

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:37.630
Make sure you leave a comment down below and
let other people know what you use as your

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:38.630
antivirus.

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:41.669
What’s your favorite because the more information
that everybody knows the better it is for

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:42.669
everybody.

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:43.669
Thank you so much for watching.

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:45.620
Stay safe out there and I'll talk to guys
in the next video.

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:45.630
Bye.
