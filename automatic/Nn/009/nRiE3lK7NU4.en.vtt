00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
never force you into being lethal or

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:06.950 
never force you into being lethal or
non-lethal<00:02:05.030> now<00:02:06.030> that<00:02:06.240> he's<00:02:06.450> out<00:02:06.630> of<00:02:06.780> the<00:02:06.840> way

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
non-lethal now that he's out of the way

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.570 
non-lethal now that he's out of the way
let's<00:02:07.170> see<00:02:07.619> what<00:02:07.770> speaking<00:02:08.160> around<00:02:08.369> that

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
let's see what speaking around that

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:15.170 
let's see what speaking around that
corner<00:02:13.370> obviously<00:02:14.370> we<00:02:14.489> have<00:02:14.610> a<00:02:14.640> few<00:02:14.910> enemies

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
corner obviously we have a few enemies

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.330 
corner obviously we have a few enemies
to<00:02:15.569> get<00:02:15.720> rid<00:02:15.870> of<00:02:15.900> and<00:02:16.290> we<00:02:16.830> might<00:02:16.980> need<00:02:17.130> a<00:02:17.190> bit

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
to get rid of and we might need a bit

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.270 
to get rid of and we might need a bit
more<00:02:17.400> ammo<00:02:17.700> to<00:02:17.940> do<00:02:18.180> it<00:02:18.330> so<00:02:18.480> let's<00:02:18.690> get<00:02:18.959> some<00:02:19.280> all

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
more ammo to do it so let's get some all

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:21.470 
more ammo to do it so let's get some all
right<00:02:20.459> I<00:02:20.489> think<00:02:20.610> we're<00:02:20.910> good<00:02:21.030> to<00:02:21.120> start<00:02:21.330> our

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
right I think we're good to start our

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:45.710 
right I think we're good to start our
assault

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.660 

so<00:02:46.720> this<00:02:46.960> was<00:02:47.140> a<00:02:47.170> purely<00:02:47.470> combat<00:02:48.130> of<00:02:48.310> approach

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
so this was a purely combat of approach

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:50.340 
so this was a purely combat of approach
something<00:02:49.300> you<00:02:49.390> can<00:02:49.540> employ<00:02:49.750> throughout<00:02:50.140> the

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:50.350 
something you can employ throughout the

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:52.200 
something you can employ throughout the
game<00:02:50.530> she<00:02:51.070> can<00:02:51.190> also<00:02:51.310> mix<00:02:51.610> it<00:02:51.760> with<00:02:51.880> stealth

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:52.210 
game she can also mix it with stealth

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:54.020 
game she can also mix it with stealth
which<00:02:52.540> we'll<00:02:52.750> see<00:02:52.780> in<00:02:52.960> this<00:02:53.200> next<00:02:53.500> playthrough

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
which we'll see in this next playthrough

00:02:54.030 --> 00:03:00.840 
which we'll see in this next playthrough
Richard<00:02:55.030> amen<00:02:58.950> since<00:02:59.950> this<00:03:00.190> is<00:03:00.250> a<00:03:00.430> stealth

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:00.850 
Richard amen since this is a stealth

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:03.060 
Richard amen since this is a stealth
approach<00:03:01.030> will<00:03:01.960> use<00:03:02.140> a<00:03:02.170> non-lethal<00:03:02.740> takedown

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:03.070 
approach will use a non-lethal takedown

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:13.230 
approach will use a non-lethal takedown
on<00:03:03.310> this<00:03:03.610> first<00:03:03.880> enemy

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:13.240 

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:15.730 

we<00:03:14.240> want<00:03:14.450> to<00:03:14.570> be<00:03:14.660> stealthy<00:03:15.140> so<00:03:15.350> let's<00:03:15.560> also

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:15.740 
we want to be stealthy so let's also

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:27.700 
we want to be stealthy so let's also
hide<00:03:16.070> the<00:03:16.190> body<00:03:16.400> and<00:03:16.820> loot<00:03:17.600> it<00:03:17.750> just<00:03:18.110> for<00:03:18.260> fun

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:27.710 

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:29.930 

now<00:03:28.710> we<00:03:28.770> have<00:03:29.010> to<00:03:29.130> find<00:03:29.340> a<00:03:29.460> way<00:03:29.580> to<00:03:29.640> get<00:03:29.850> around

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
now we have to find a way to get around

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:32.480 
now we have to find a way to get around
these<00:03:30.450> enemies<00:03:30.750> without<00:03:31.020> being<00:03:31.410> seen<00:03:31.710> the

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:32.490 
these enemies without being seen the

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:34.340 
these enemies without being seen the
best<00:03:32.700> way<00:03:32.850> to<00:03:32.910> go<00:03:33.090> about<00:03:33.120> this<00:03:33.390> is<00:03:33.750> to<00:03:33.780> explore

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350 
best way to go about this is to explore

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:36.170 
best way to go about this is to explore
so<00:03:34.830> let's<00:03:35.010> backtrack<00:03:35.280> and<00:03:35.700> see<00:03:35.910> what<00:03:36.060> was

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
so let's backtrack and see what was

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:39.470 
so let's backtrack and see what was
hiding<00:03:36.540> in<00:03:36.630> that<00:03:36.660> room<00:03:37.520> when<00:03:38.520> you<00:03:38.670> explore<00:03:39.090> you

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
hiding in that room when you explore you

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.330 
hiding in that room when you explore you
can<00:03:39.660> discover<00:03:39.990> alternate<00:03:40.680> paths<00:03:40.920> that<00:03:41.130> help

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
can discover alternate paths that help

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.850 
can discover alternate paths that help
you<00:03:41.430> go<00:03:41.610> around<00:03:41.700> major<00:03:42.150> obstacles<00:03:42.840> since<00:03:43.560> the

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:43.860 
you go around major obstacles since the

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:45.470 
you go around major obstacles since the
level<00:03:44.160> design<00:03:44.250> in<00:03:44.670> Deus<00:03:44.880> Ex<00:03:45.120> Human<00:03:45.330> Revolution

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
level design in Deus Ex Human Revolution

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:55.110 
level design in Deus Ex Human Revolution
supports<00:03:46.320> many<00:03:46.560> different<00:03:46.980> approaches

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:55.120 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.759 

now<00:03:56.120> let's<00:03:56.390> use<00:03:56.599> the<00:03:56.780> cover<00:03:57.019> system<00:03:57.290> to<00:03:57.560> hide

00:03:57.759 --> 00:03:57.769 
now let's use the cover system to hide

00:03:57.769 --> 00:03:59.890 
now let's use the cover system to hide
from<00:03:57.980> these<00:03:58.219> guys<00:03:58.459> we'll<00:03:59.299> wait<00:03:59.480> until<00:03:59.629> they

00:03:59.890 --> 00:03:59.900 
from these guys we'll wait until they

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:01.630 
from these guys we'll wait until they
finish<00:04:00.170> their<00:04:00.319> patrol<00:04:00.739> and<00:04:00.980> we<00:04:01.310> can<00:04:01.489> gain

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:01.640 
finish their patrol and we can gain

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:03.280 
finish their patrol and we can gain
access<00:04:01.849> to<00:04:02.120> the<00:04:02.299> warehouse<00:04:02.510> without<00:04:03.049> being

access to the warehouse without being
seen

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:11.060 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:13.360 

notice<00:04:11.870> that<00:04:11.900> the<00:04:12.080> coverage<00:04:12.500> system<00:04:12.890> is<00:04:13.099> used

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:13.370 
notice that the coverage system is used

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:15.699 
notice that the coverage system is used
in<00:04:13.550> two<00:04:13.760> ways<00:04:14.000> first<00:04:14.750> to<00:04:15.170> survey<00:04:15.530> your

in two ways first to survey your
surroundings<00:04:16.250> of<00:04:16.400> plan<00:04:16.639> your<00:04:16.820> approach<00:04:17.180> then

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:17.780 
surroundings of plan your approach then

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:19.539 
surroundings of plan your approach then
second<00:04:18.290> to<00:04:18.380> physically<00:04:18.829> hide<00:04:19.070> yourself<00:04:19.489> from

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:19.549 
second to physically hide yourself from

second to physically hide yourself from
your<00:04:19.850> enemies<00:04:20.000> this<00:04:20.780> is<00:04:20.959> entirely<00:04:21.290> optional

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:21.680 
your enemies this is entirely optional

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:38.529 
your enemies this is entirely optional
but<00:04:22.250> very<00:04:22.550> useful

briefing<00:04:54.210> let's<00:04:54.870> try<00:04:55.050> to<00:04:55.169> get<00:04:55.350> insight<00:04:55.800> using

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:56.250 
briefing let's try to get insight using

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:03.040 
briefing let's try to get insight using
it

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:03.050 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:05.120 

again<00:05:04.050> we'll<00:05:04.290> need<00:05:04.440> to<00:05:04.590> take<00:05:04.770> care<00:05:04.980> of<00:05:05.040> that

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:05.130 
again we'll need to take care of that

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:17.350 
again we'll need to take care of that
century<00:05:05.550> so<00:05:06.180> we'll<00:05:06.330> use<00:05:06.510> another<00:05:06.810> takedown

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:17.360 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:19.700 

let's<00:05:18.360> hide<00:05:18.570> it<00:05:18.720> more<00:05:18.900> carefully<00:05:19.170> this<00:05:19.650> time

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:19.710 
let's hide it more carefully this time

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:45.480 
let's hide it more carefully this time
just<00:05:20.310> for<00:05:20.520> fun

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:45.490 

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:48.089 

the<00:05:46.090> layout<00:05:46.419> is<00:05:46.449> the<00:05:46.780> same<00:05:46.960> as<00:05:47.080> before<00:05:47.530> but<00:05:47.979> if

00:05:48.089 --> 00:05:48.099 
the layout is the same as before but if
