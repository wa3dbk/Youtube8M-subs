00:00:28.499 --> 00:00:28.509 
here's my original feeder and waterer

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:30.970 
here's my original feeder and waterer
and<00:00:29.509> I<00:00:29.989> found<00:00:30.200> that<00:00:30.290> these<00:00:30.470> two<00:00:30.649> things<00:00:30.680> were

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:30.980 
and I found that these two things were

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:32.860 
and I found that these two things were
just<00:00:31.009> they're<00:00:31.610> too<00:00:31.820> small<00:00:32.119> I<00:00:32.360> was<00:00:32.540> changing

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:32.870 
just they're too small I was changing

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:35.020 
just they're too small I was changing
them<00:00:33.020> every<00:00:33.200> day<00:00:33.230> became<00:00:34.130> a<00:00:34.190> chore<00:00:34.489> so<00:00:34.730> I<00:00:34.760> moved

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:35.030 
them every day became a chore so I moved

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:37.389 
them every day became a chore so I moved
to<00:00:35.300> something<00:00:36.260> else<00:00:36.440> figured<00:00:36.949> out<00:00:37.070> from

00:00:37.389 --> 00:00:37.399 
to something else figured out from

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:39.099 
to something else figured out from
reading<00:00:37.609> some<00:00:37.760> forums<00:00:38.239> and<00:00:38.420> other<00:00:38.480> ideas<00:00:38.870> I

00:00:39.099 --> 00:00:39.109 
reading some forums and other ideas I

00:00:39.109 --> 00:00:42.459 
reading some forums and other ideas I
went<00:00:39.829> with<00:00:40.510> buckets<00:00:41.510> and<00:00:41.690> oil<00:00:41.870> pans<00:00:42.170> so

00:00:42.459 --> 00:00:42.469 
went with buckets and oil pans so

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:44.680 
went with buckets and oil pans so
basically<00:00:42.829> just<00:00:43.250> got<00:00:43.399> two<00:00:43.670> white<00:00:44.179> buckets

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:44.690 
basically just got two white buckets

out<00:00:59.089> two<00:01:00.550> good-sized<00:01:01.550> holes<00:01:01.879> those<00:01:02.089> got<00:01:02.269> to<00:01:02.390> be

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:02.480 
out two good-sized holes those got to be

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.200 
out two good-sized holes those got to be
a<00:01:02.510> couple<00:01:02.749> to<00:01:03.170> three<00:01:03.409> inch<00:01:03.530> diameter<00:01:04.030> holes<00:01:05.030> I

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:05.210 
a couple to three inch diameter holes I

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:07.859 
a couple to three inch diameter holes I
just<00:01:05.390> used<00:01:05.630> a<00:01:05.810> box<00:01:06.619> cutter<00:01:06.890> to<00:01:07.100> cut<00:01:07.250> those<00:01:07.490> out

00:01:07.859 --> 00:01:07.869 
just used a box cutter to cut those out

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:12.249 
just used a box cutter to cut those out
and<00:01:08.869> then<00:01:09.710> inside<00:01:10.130> I<00:01:10.430> just<00:01:10.520> secured<00:01:11.119> it<00:01:11.270> with<00:01:11.479> a

00:01:12.249 --> 00:01:12.259 
and then inside I just secured it with a

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:16.300 
and then inside I just secured it with a
little<00:01:12.939> nut<00:01:13.939> and<00:01:14.090> washer<00:01:14.210> here<00:01:15.159> just<00:01:16.159> so<00:01:16.250> it

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:16.310 
little nut and washer here just so it

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:18.190 
little nut and washer here just so it
doesn't<00:01:16.520> move<00:01:16.610> around<00:01:16.840> as<00:01:17.840> they're<00:01:18.020> eating

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:18.200 
doesn't move around as they're eating

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.139 
doesn't move around as they're eating
and<00:01:18.500> I'll<00:01:19.280> fill<00:01:19.490> it<00:01:19.610> up<00:01:19.700> and<00:01:19.850> I'll<00:01:19.939> show<00:01:20.119> you

00:01:20.139 --> 00:01:20.149 
and I'll fill it up and I'll show you

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:21.910 
and I'll fill it up and I'll show you
you<00:01:20.299> know<00:01:20.420> when<00:01:20.540> they<00:01:20.630> Peck<00:01:20.869> it<00:01:21.020> it<00:01:21.110> just<00:01:21.290> just

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:21.920 
you know when they Peck it it just just

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.499 
you know when they Peck it it just just
self<00:01:22.250> feeds<00:01:22.549> itself<00:01:23.530> the<00:01:24.530> water<00:01:24.740> was<00:01:25.009> a<00:01:25.040> little

00:01:25.499 --> 00:01:25.509 
self feeds itself the water was a little

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:27.760 
self feeds itself the water was a little
different

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:27.770 
different

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.010 
different
basically<00:01:28.340> it's<00:01:28.549> the<00:01:28.610> same<00:01:28.850> bucket<00:01:29.180> but<00:01:29.780> this

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020 
basically it's the same bucket but this

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.789 
basically it's the same bucket but this
time<00:01:30.350> I<00:01:30.700> drilled<00:01:31.700> some<00:01:32.030> holes<00:01:32.530> around<00:01:33.530> the

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:33.799 
time I drilled some holes around the

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:38.039 
time I drilled some holes around the
edge<00:01:33.950> I<00:01:34.219> believe<00:01:34.430> these<00:01:34.579> are<00:01:35.500> 3/8<00:01:36.500> holes<00:01:36.890> I

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:38.049 
edge I believe these are 3/8 holes I

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:41.410 
edge I believe these are 3/8 holes I
found<00:01:39.049> I<00:01:39.289> found<00:01:40.070> that<00:01:40.460> smaller<00:01:40.789> holes<00:01:41.060> didn't

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:41.420 
found I found that smaller holes didn't

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.870 
found I found that smaller holes didn't
actually<00:01:41.840> allow<00:01:42.770> it<00:01:42.890> to<00:01:43.009> drain<00:01:43.280> so<00:01:43.520> what<00:01:43.640> I<00:01:43.670> did

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:43.880 
actually allow it to drain so what I did

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.029 
actually allow it to drain so what I did
is<00:01:44.000> just<00:01:44.030> drilled<00:01:44.390> these<00:01:44.479> holes<00:01:44.539> in<00:01:44.930> here<00:01:45.170> at<00:01:45.979> a

00:01:46.029 --> 00:01:46.039 
is just drilled these holes in here at a

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:48.279 
is just drilled these holes in here at a
level<00:01:46.399> that's<00:01:46.549> lower<00:01:46.969> than<00:01:47.509> the<00:01:47.899> level<00:01:48.140> of

00:01:48.279 --> 00:01:48.289 
level that's lower than the level of

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:50.770 
level that's lower than the level of
this<00:01:48.439> oil<00:01:48.649> pan<00:01:49.009> they<00:01:49.789> see<00:01:50.060> so<00:01:50.329> it<00:01:50.450> fills<00:01:50.630> up

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:50.780 
this oil pan they see so it fills up

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.740 
this oil pan they see so it fills up
almost<00:01:51.380> all<00:01:51.829> the<00:01:51.979> way<00:01:52.130> and<00:01:52.399> then<00:01:53.180> I<00:01:53.420> turn<00:01:53.719> it

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 
almost all the way and then I turn it

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:55.779 
almost all the way and then I turn it
upside<00:01:53.869> down<00:01:54.109> because<00:01:54.469> you<00:01:54.560> need<00:01:54.710> the<00:01:54.859> seal<00:01:55.100> so

00:01:55.779 --> 00:01:55.789 
upside down because you need the seal so

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:58.209 
upside down because you need the seal so
that<00:01:55.939> it<00:01:56.060> doesn't<00:01:56.770> so<00:01:57.770> it<00:01:57.829> doesn't<00:01:58.100> just

00:01:58.209 --> 00:01:58.219 
that it doesn't so it doesn't just

00:01:58.219 --> 00:02:00.190 
that it doesn't so it doesn't just
completely<00:01:58.369> drain<00:01:58.880> out<00:01:59.060> and<00:01:59.240> then<00:01:59.780> on<00:01:59.869> the<00:01:59.960> top

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:00.200 
completely drain out and then on the top

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.770 
completely drain out and then on the top
I<00:02:00.560> don't<00:02:01.520> need<00:02:01.670> to<00:02:01.729> ever<00:02:01.850> reseal<00:02:02.299> this<00:02:02.479> I<00:02:02.600> just

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:02.780 
I don't need to ever reseal this I just

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:04.719 
I don't need to ever reseal this I just
sealed<00:02:02.990> it<00:02:03.140> and<00:02:03.259> I<00:02:03.320> made<00:02:03.770> a<00:02:03.799> hole<00:02:04.070> for<00:02:04.399> my<00:02:04.520> hose

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:04.729 
sealed it and I made a hole for my hose

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:07.240 
sealed it and I made a hole for my hose
to<00:02:05.149> fill<00:02:05.179> up<00:02:05.479> the<00:02:06.079> water<00:02:06.109> and<00:02:06.649> then<00:02:06.859> when<00:02:07.009> I<00:02:07.039> got

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 
to fill up the water and then when I got

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:09.310 
to fill up the water and then when I got
a<00:02:07.310> fill<00:02:07.609> filled<00:02:08.479> I<00:02:08.600> just<00:02:08.780> kind<00:02:08.929> of<00:02:08.990> turned<00:02:09.200> it

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:09.320 
a fill filled I just kind of turned it

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:12.580 
a fill filled I just kind of turned it
over<00:02:09.410> it<00:02:09.860> all<00:02:09.979> drains<00:02:10.250> in<00:02:10.520> here<00:02:10.760> and<00:02:11.500> seems<00:02:12.500> to

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
over it all drains in here and seems to

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.370 
over it all drains in here and seems to
work<00:02:12.710> pretty<00:02:12.740> well<00:02:13.120> it<00:02:14.120> does<00:02:14.360> get<00:02:14.570> muddy<00:02:14.870> after

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
work pretty well it does get muddy after

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:16.630 
work pretty well it does get muddy after
about<00:02:15.680> a

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
about a

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.490 
about a
the<00:02:16.970> dirt<00:02:17.209> from<00:02:17.390> their<00:02:17.569> pecking<00:02:17.959> gets<00:02:18.200> all<00:02:18.349> in

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
the dirt from their pecking gets all in

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.830 
the dirt from their pecking gets all in
here<00:02:18.740> and<00:02:18.860> kind<00:02:19.640> of<00:02:19.730> messes<00:02:20.000> it<00:02:20.150> up<00:02:20.239> so<00:02:20.510> that's

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
here and kind of messes it up so that's

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.449 
here and kind of messes it up so that's
why<00:02:21.080> I<00:02:21.110> change<00:02:21.440> it<00:02:21.590> but<00:02:21.739> there<00:02:21.980> is<00:02:22.099> more<00:02:22.280> water

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:22.459 
why I change it but there is more water

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:24.490 
why I change it but there is more water
in<00:02:22.730> there<00:02:22.940> I<00:02:23.120> could<00:02:23.630> let<00:02:23.780> it<00:02:23.870> go<00:02:23.900> longer<00:02:24.200> if<00:02:24.349> I

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
in there I could let it go longer if I

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.410 
in there I could let it go longer if I
wanted<00:02:24.800> to<00:02:24.950> you<00:02:25.760> know<00:02:25.849> that's<00:02:26.030> the<00:02:26.120> basic

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
wanted to you know that's the basic

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:27.670 
wanted to you know that's the basic
setup<00:02:26.569> I'll<00:02:26.810> show<00:02:26.930> you<00:02:27.020> the<00:02:27.080> feeder<00:02:27.319> so<00:02:27.530> here's

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
setup I'll show you the feeder so here's

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.770 
setup I'll show you the feeder so here's
the<00:02:27.770> feeder<00:02:27.980> filled<00:02:28.280> up<00:02:28.459> and<00:02:29.090> you<00:02:29.209> can<00:02:29.450> see<00:02:29.660> it

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
the feeder filled up and you can see it

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:31.900 
the feeder filled up and you can see it
drains<00:02:30.440> out<00:02:30.590> naturally<00:02:31.040> as<00:02:31.160> I<00:02:31.190> peck<00:02:31.520> at<00:02:31.730> it

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:31.910 
drains out naturally as I peck at it

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:35.350 
drains out naturally as I peck at it
more<00:02:32.720> food<00:02:33.020> just<00:02:33.260> keeps<00:02:33.290> coming<00:02:33.650> so<00:02:34.360> they're

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
more food just keeps coming so they're

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.540 
more food just keeps coming so they're
big<00:02:35.540> enough<00:02:35.569> I<00:02:36.020> just<00:02:36.770> played<00:02:37.069> with<00:02:37.100> the<00:02:37.340> size

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:37.550 
big enough I just played with the size

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:39.400 
big enough I just played with the size
you'll<00:02:38.090> need<00:02:38.239> fairly<00:02:38.569> large<00:02:38.750> holes<00:02:38.989> for<00:02:39.230> it<00:02:39.290> to

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
you'll need fairly large holes for it to

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:42.490 
you'll need fairly large holes for it to
free<00:02:39.709> slowly<00:02:40.600> flow<00:02:41.600> freely

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
free slowly flow freely

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.640 
free slowly flow freely
these<00:02:43.010> are<00:02:43.330> layer<00:02:44.330> pellets<00:02:44.930> if<00:02:45.140> you<00:02:45.500> have

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650 
these are layer pellets if you have

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:47.620 
these are layer pellets if you have
smaller<00:02:46.010> grain<00:02:46.340> food<00:02:47.090> you<00:02:47.269> probably<00:02:47.390> need

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:47.630 
smaller grain food you probably need

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:50.860 
smaller grain food you probably need
smaller<00:02:47.870> holes<00:02:48.970> and<00:02:49.970> so<00:02:50.120> that's<00:02:50.269> basically<00:02:50.630> it

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
smaller holes and so that's basically it

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:54.460 
smaller holes and so that's basically it
I<00:02:51.830> have<00:02:52.310> these<00:02:52.489> in<00:02:52.700> my<00:02:52.730> coop<00:02:53.090> and<00:02:53.300> I<00:02:54.230> have<00:02:54.350> it

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 
I have these in my coop and I have it

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:57.160 
I have these in my coop and I have it
protected<00:02:54.650> by<00:02:55.069> a<00:02:55.100> little<00:02:55.489> wooden<00:02:56.390> roof<00:02:56.840> so

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.170 
protected by a little wooden roof so

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:59.650 
protected by a little wooden roof so
that<00:02:57.200> the<00:02:57.620> food<00:02:57.830> doesn't<00:02:58.010> get<00:02:58.160> soggy<00:02:58.370> and<00:02:58.700> that

00:02:59.650 --> 00:02:59.660 
that the food doesn't get soggy and that

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:02.229 
that the food doesn't get soggy and that
allows<00:02:59.870> me<00:03:00.049> to<00:03:00.080> change<00:03:00.230> it<00:03:00.620> about<00:03:01.250> once<00:03:02.120> a<00:03:02.209> week

00:03:02.229 --> 00:03:02.239 
allows me to change it about once a week

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:05.440 
allows me to change it about once a week
Adam<00:03:02.900> at<00:03:03.739> the<00:03:04.010> minimum<00:03:04.250> sometimes<00:03:05.180> longer

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
Adam at the minimum sometimes longer

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:07.030 
Adam at the minimum sometimes longer
depending<00:03:05.720> how<00:03:06.200> much<00:03:06.350> free-ranging<00:03:06.920> they're

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
depending how much free-ranging they're

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.150 
depending how much free-ranging they're
doing<00:03:07.310> I<00:03:07.459> realize<00:03:08.450> this<00:03:08.630> isn't<00:03:08.870> a<00:03:09.230> solution

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:10.160 
doing I realize this isn't a solution

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:11.620 
doing I realize this isn't a solution
for<00:03:10.489> everybody<00:03:10.910> depending<00:03:11.269> where<00:03:11.390> you<00:03:11.480> live

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:13.850 
but for me this is the easy easy

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:16.870 
but for me this is the easy easy
