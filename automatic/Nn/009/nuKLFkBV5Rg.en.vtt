feelings about having so many figures

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.760 
feelings about having so many figures
and<00:00:14.610> the<00:00:15.240> thing<00:00:15.420> about<00:00:15.660> my<00:00:15.870> custom<00:00:16.529> calendar

and the thing about my custom calendar

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.160 
and the thing about my custom calendar
is<00:00:17.190> that<00:00:17.220> it's<00:00:18.000> what<00:00:18.240> I<00:00:18.420> would<00:00:18.660> do<00:00:18.840> not

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
is that it's what I would do not

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.320 
is that it's what I would do not
necessarily<00:00:19.470> what<00:00:20.039> Lego<00:00:20.250> would<00:00:20.520> do<00:00:20.670> and<00:00:20.910> I've

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
necessarily what Lego would do and I've

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.150 
necessarily what Lego would do and I've
kind<00:00:21.539> of<00:00:21.660> been<00:00:21.720> trying<00:00:21.960> to<00:00:22.230> just<00:00:22.439> alternate<00:00:22.980> it

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
kind of been trying to just alternate it

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.880 
kind of been trying to just alternate it
you<00:00:23.640> know<00:00:23.730> figure<00:00:24.269> than<00:00:24.570> build<00:00:24.840> figure<00:00:25.529> build

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
you know figure than build figure build

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.040 
you know figure than build figure build
and<00:00:26.189> some<00:00:26.699> of<00:00:26.789> the<00:00:26.880> builds<00:00:27.210> are<00:00:27.420> things<00:00:27.840> like

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
and some of the builds are things like

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.830 
and some of the builds are things like
the<00:00:28.230> Christmas<00:00:28.470> tree<00:00:28.980> or<00:00:29.220> the<00:00:30.179> weapons<00:00:30.570> and

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
the Christmas tree or the weapons and

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.319 
the Christmas tree or the weapons and
different<00:00:31.109> things<00:00:31.320> so<00:00:32.099> hopefully<00:00:32.820> you<00:00:33.149> guys

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
different things so hopefully you guys

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.000 
different things so hopefully you guys
understand<00:00:33.899> that<00:00:34.050> this<00:00:34.350> is<00:00:34.469> not<00:00:34.620> meant<00:00:34.860> to<00:00:34.920> be

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
understand that this is not meant to be

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.590 
understand that this is not meant to be
just<00:00:35.399> like<00:00:35.610> the<00:00:35.760> way<00:00:35.880> Lego<00:00:36.149> would<00:00:36.360> do<00:00:36.480> it

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
just like the way Lego would do it

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.360 
just like the way Lego would do it
because<00:00:37.170> if<00:00:37.320> Lego<00:00:37.559> would<00:00:37.800> do<00:00:37.920> it<00:00:38.070> you<00:00:38.280> would

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
because if Lego would do it you would

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.310 
because if Lego would do it you would
have<00:00:38.430> about<00:00:38.790> half<00:00:39.090> as<00:00:39.270> many<00:00:39.390> figures<00:00:39.870> as<00:00:40.140> what

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
have about half as many figures as what

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.740 
have about half as many figures as what
I<00:00:40.350> have<00:00:40.620> right<00:00:40.829> now<00:00:41.010> that's<00:00:41.820> just<00:00:41.910> how<00:00:42.510> they<00:00:42.690> do

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
I have right now that's just how they do

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.229 
I have right now that's just how they do
things<00:00:43.110> but<00:00:43.410> this<00:00:44.100> is<00:00:44.280> how<00:00:44.399> I<00:00:44.610> would<00:00:44.850> do<00:00:44.969> it<00:00:45.000> if

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
things but this is how I would do it if

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.020 
things but this is how I would do it if
I<00:00:45.270> were<00:00:45.750> doing<00:00:45.870> a<00:00:46.200> real<00:00:46.800> calendar<00:00:47.460> from<00:00:47.789> Lego

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
I were doing a real calendar from Lego

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.299 
I were doing a real calendar from Lego
so<00:00:48.870> anyway<00:00:49.590> day<00:00:50.129> number<00:00:50.370> 16<00:00:51.059> is<00:00:51.890> not<00:00:52.890> a<00:00:52.920> figure

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
so anyway day number 16 is not a figure

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.670 
so anyway day number 16 is not a figure
I'd<00:00:53.820> overheard<00:00:54.270> those<00:00:54.570> of<00:00:54.750> you<00:00:54.870> who<00:00:55.440> have<00:00:55.559> been

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
I'd overheard those of you who have been

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.160 
I'd overheard those of you who have been
looking<00:00:55.860> at<00:00:56.370> all<00:00:57.000> these<00:00:57.149> figures<00:00:57.390> it's

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
looking at all these figures it's

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.110 
looking at all these figures it's
actually<00:00:58.530> a<00:00:58.559> build<00:00:58.920> and<00:00:59.160> I<00:00:59.489> know<00:00:59.550> a<00:00:59.640> lot<00:00:59.910> of<00:00:59.940> you

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
actually a build and I know a lot of you

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.360 
actually a build and I know a lot of you
guys<00:01:00.539> have<00:01:00.930> been<00:01:00.960> asking<00:01:01.320> about<00:01:01.859> something

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
for the snakes and I have been trying to

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.000 
for the snakes and I have been trying to
think<00:01:05.729> of<00:01:05.880> exactly<00:01:06.119> what<00:01:06.420> to<00:01:06.540> do<00:01:06.689> because<00:01:07.320> it's

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
think of exactly what to do because it's

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.660 
think of exactly what to do because it's
gonna<00:01:08.760> be<00:01:08.909> pretty<00:01:09.119> hard<00:01:09.360> to<00:01:09.570> a<00:01:09.750> custom

different staffs that they have and one

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.920 
different staffs that they have and one
of<00:01:25.920> these<00:01:26.040> I<00:01:26.100> used<00:01:26.610> to<00:01:26.670> have<00:01:26.880> turned<00:01:27.270> the<00:01:27.720> wrong

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930
