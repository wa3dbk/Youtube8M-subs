ipod<00:00:40.110> video<00:00:40.350> cable<00:00:40.980> but<00:00:41.129> it<00:00:41.219> does<00:00:41.430> exactly<00:00:41.850> the

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
ipod video cable but it does exactly the

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.540 
ipod video cable but it does exactly the
same<00:00:42.210> thing<00:00:42.450> except<00:00:43.440> that<00:00:43.620> the<00:00:43.829> colors<00:00:44.340> are

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
mixed up so instead of white this should

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.619 
mixed up so instead of white this should
be<00:00:48.930> yellow<00:00:49.079> it<00:00:49.800> was<00:00:50.070> a<00:00:50.100> real<00:00:50.370> ipod<00:00:50.820> video<00:00:51.030> cable

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
that's my v on it as I use it for my

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.350 
that's my v on it as I use it for my
ipod<00:00:54.090> video<00:00:55.579> basically<00:00:56.579> that<00:00:57.030> should<00:00:57.239> be

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
ipod video basically that should be

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.830 
ipod video basically that should be
yellow<00:00:57.649> and<00:00:58.649> then<00:00:59.489> at<00:00:59.879> the<00:01:00.059> other<00:01:00.090> end<00:01:00.510> you

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:02.840 
yellow and then at the other end you

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:07.070 
yellow and then at the other end you
have<00:01:03.840> the<00:01:05.000> you'll<00:01:06.000> have<00:01:06.270> this<00:01:06.540> will<00:01:06.750> be<00:01:06.869> white

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
have the you'll have this will be white

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.250 
have the you'll have this will be white
instead<00:01:07.530> and<00:01:07.770> this<00:01:07.920> would<00:01:08.070> be<00:01:08.100> rad<00:01:09.260> basically

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
instead and this would be rad basically

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.260 
instead and this would be rad basically
you<00:01:10.619> can<00:01:10.770> either<00:01:10.890> plug<00:01:11.220> it<00:01:11.400> into<00:01:11.520> a<00:01:11.700> mixer

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
you can either plug it into a mixer

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.820 
you can either plug it into a mixer
input<00:01:13.369> or<00:01:14.369> you<00:01:14.880> can<00:01:15.119> just<00:01:15.290> let<00:01:16.290> them<00:01:16.470> hang

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
input or you can just let them hang

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.429 
input or you can just let them hang
loose<00:01:17.130> plug<00:01:17.790> it<00:01:17.909> into<00:01:18.030> the<00:01:18.180> input<00:01:18.390> on<00:01:18.810> an<00:01:19.080> app

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
loose plug it into the input on an app

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:27.039 
loose plug it into the input on an app
like<00:01:19.710> so<00:01:22.009> you<00:01:23.009> need<00:01:23.400> two<00:01:23.610> of<00:01:23.640> these<00:01:24.080> at<00:01:25.080> least

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:27.049 
like so you need two of these at least

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:33.710 
like so you need two of these at least
plug<00:01:28.049> that<00:01:28.229> in

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:57.000 

volume<00:01:49.170> and<00:01:50.170> that's<00:01:50.440> it<00:01:54.360> or<00:01:55.360> if<00:01:55.720> you<00:01:55.900> want<00:01:56.140> your

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:57.010 
volume and that's it or if you want your

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:59.160 
volume and that's it or if you want your
more<00:01:57.250> adventurous<00:01:57.700> you<00:01:57.880> can<00:01:58.000> just<00:01:58.210> chop<00:01:59.140> up

00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.170 
more adventurous you can just chop up

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:02.640 
more adventurous you can just chop up
the<00:01:59.530> ipod<00:01:59.920> video<00:02:00.160> cable<00:02:00.790> and<00:02:01.200> solder<00:02:02.200> on<00:02:02.440> your

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:02.650 
the ipod video cable and solder on your
