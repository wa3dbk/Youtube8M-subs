because i'm not in that math class

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:07.480 
because i'm not in that math class
anymore<00:02:05.600> I<00:02:05.960> was<00:02:06.619> with<00:02:06.770> in<00:02:06.920> geometry<00:02:07.220> class

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.490 
anymore I was with in geometry class

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:08.949 
anymore I was with in geometry class
with<00:02:07.880> the<00:02:07.909> same<00:02:08.179> teacher<00:02:08.450> that<00:02:08.690> was<00:02:08.780> named

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:08.959 
with the same teacher that was named

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:13.030 
with the same teacher that was named
Walker<00:02:09.259> but<00:02:10.190> I<00:02:10.250> got<00:02:10.399> switched<00:02:10.580> out<00:02:10.819> so<00:02:12.040> and

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
Walker but I got switched out so and

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:18.940 
Walker but I got switched out so and
then<00:02:13.190> this<00:02:13.370> is<00:02:13.760> these<00:02:14.569> for<00:02:15.910> math<00:02:16.910> actually<00:02:17.950> so

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
then this is these for math actually so

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:20.350 
then this is these for math actually so
I<00:02:18.980> don't<00:02:19.220> think<00:02:19.370> I<00:02:19.400> need<00:02:19.489> this<00:02:19.760> sense<00:02:20.090> of<00:02:20.150> it<00:02:20.269> in

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
I don't think I need this sense of it in

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.830 
I don't think I need this sense of it in
different<00:02:20.480> geometry<00:02:21.170> class<00:02:21.380> and<00:02:22.330> then<00:02:23.330> we'll

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
different geometry class and then we'll

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.309 
different geometry class and then we'll
see<00:02:23.989> what's<00:02:24.170> up<00:02:24.260> her<00:02:24.380> in<00:02:24.500> here<00:02:24.739> i<00:02:25.030> have<00:02:26.030> my
