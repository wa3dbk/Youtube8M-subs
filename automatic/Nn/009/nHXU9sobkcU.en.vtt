00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 
or many people refer to it as Satori

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:17.730 
or many people refer to it as Satori
it's<00:02:15.580> like<00:02:15.880> this<00:02:16.120> you<00:02:16.420> know<00:02:16.560> special<00:02:17.560> rhythm

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:17.740 
it's like this you know special rhythm

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:19.590

and<00:02:18.040> once<00:02:18.310> you<00:02:18.730> know<00:02:18.820> I<00:02:18.850> get<00:02:19.060> into<00:02:19.240> that<00:02:19.270> rhythm

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:19.600 
and once you know I get into that rhythm

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.590 
and once you know I get into that rhythm
I<00:02:19.960> feel<00:02:20.500> like<00:02:20.620> I<00:02:20.650> can<00:02:20.890> run<00:02:21.010> forever<00:02:21.220> and<00:02:21.820> to<00:02:22.420> me

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:22.600 
I feel like I can run forever and to me

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.270 
I feel like I can run forever and to me
I<00:02:22.930> think<00:02:23.050> that's<00:02:23.380> what<00:02:23.650> I'm<00:02:23.770> always<00:02:23.950> searching

for
and<00:02:25.569> I<00:02:25.930> think<00:02:25.989> it's<00:02:26.290> just<00:02:27.010> that

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
and I think it's just that

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.610 
and I think it's just that
that<00:02:29.490> time<00:02:29.760> we're<00:02:30.060> running<00:02:30.900> is<00:02:31.140> really<00:02:31.290> easy

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
that time we're running is really easy

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.800 
that time we're running is really easy
and<00:02:32.220> I<00:02:32.670> know<00:02:32.940> a<00:02:33.120> lot<00:02:33.330> of<00:02:33.360> people<00:02:33.660> when<00:02:33.750> you

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
and I know a lot of people when you

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:35.810 
and I know a lot of people when you
first<00:02:34.050> start<00:02:34.320> running<00:02:34.680> it<00:02:35.400> doesn't<00:02:35.670> feel<00:02:35.760> like

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:35.820 
first start running it doesn't feel like

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:37.370 
first start running it doesn't feel like
running<00:02:36.150> is<00:02:36.330> gonna<00:02:36.480> be<00:02:36.600> easy<00:02:36.930> our<00:02:37.110> running
