familiar<00:00:13.440> with<00:00:13.860> my<00:00:14.070> channel<00:00:14.460> probably<00:00:15.030> know

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
familiar with my channel probably know

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.120 
familiar with my channel probably know
that<00:00:15.599> I<00:00:15.839> don't<00:00:16.170> do<00:00:16.320> a<00:00:16.350> whole<00:00:16.470> lot<00:00:16.650> of<00:00:16.830> pack

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
that I don't do a whole lot of pack

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.970 
that I don't do a whole lot of pack
openings<00:00:17.640> it's<00:00:18.210> not<00:00:18.300> really<00:00:18.449> my<00:00:18.570> thing<00:00:18.690> I<00:00:19.170> tend

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
openings it's not really my thing I tend

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.609 
openings it's not really my thing I tend
to<00:00:20.070> conserve<00:00:20.520> my<00:00:20.730> coins<00:00:21.029> I<00:00:21.420> just<00:00:22.080> don't<00:00:22.230> open<00:00:22.410> a

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
to conserve my coins I just don't open a

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.529 
to conserve my coins I just don't open a
lot<00:00:22.769> of<00:00:22.890> packs<00:00:23.130> and<00:00:23.519> I<00:00:24.029> think<00:00:24.300> the<00:00:24.420> biggest

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
lot of packs and I think the biggest

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.120 
lot of packs and I think the biggest
reason<00:00:24.779> for<00:00:25.230> that<00:00:25.320> is<00:00:25.529> because<00:00:25.560> when<00:00:25.949> I<00:00:26.010> was

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
reason for that is because when I was

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.890 
reason for that is because when I was
first<00:00:26.310> getting<00:00:26.519> started<00:00:26.789> a<00:00:27.300> lot<00:00:27.720> of<00:00:27.750> my

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
first getting started a lot of my

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.689 
first getting started a lot of my
friends<00:00:28.140> you<00:00:28.380> guys<00:00:28.500> know<00:00:28.740> I'm<00:00:28.859> Ryan<00:00:29.310> chase

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.120 
friends you guys know I'm Ryan chase
London<00:00:30.570> those<00:00:31.320> guys<00:00:31.529> would<00:00:31.650> always<00:00:31.890> tell<00:00:32.099> me

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
London those guys would always tell me

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.150 
London those guys would always tell me
that<00:00:32.279> they<00:00:33.030> end<00:00:33.390> up<00:00:33.660> spending<00:00:34.020> a<00:00:34.410> ton<00:00:34.739> of<00:00:34.800> coins

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
that they end up spending a ton of coins

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.299 
that they end up spending a ton of coins
on<00:00:35.550> opening<00:00:36.510> packs<00:00:36.780> and<00:00:37.170> they<00:00:37.860> never<00:00:38.070> get

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
on opening packs and they never get

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:39.799 
on opening packs and they never get
anything<00:00:38.520> in<00:00:38.790> those<00:00:38.879> packs<00:00:39.180> and<00:00:39.420> they<00:00:39.480> get<00:00:39.629> so

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
anything in those packs and they get so

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.970 
anything in those packs and they get so
upset<00:00:39.960> about<00:00:40.260> it<00:00:40.590> so<00:00:41.250> I<00:00:41.579> don't<00:00:42.480> really<00:00:42.750> open<00:00:43.710> up

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
upset about it so I don't really open up

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.240 
upset about it so I don't really open up
a<00:00:44.129> lot<00:00:44.309> of<00:00:44.430> packs<00:00:44.640> because<00:00:44.879> I<00:00:45.120> guess<00:00:45.270> my<00:00:45.450> first

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:46.250 
a lot of packs because I guess my first

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:48.860 
a lot of packs because I guess my first
instinct<00:00:47.250> is<00:00:47.340> to<00:00:47.520> not<00:00:47.760> do<00:00:48.030> that<00:00:48.210> after<00:00:48.539> hearing

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
instinct is to not do that after hearing

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.610 
instinct is to not do that after hearing
them<00:00:48.989> complain<00:00:49.440> so<00:00:49.710> much<00:00:49.760> so<00:00:50.899> that's<00:00:51.899> why<00:00:52.110> my

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
them complain so much so that's why my

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.319 
them complain so much so that's why my
channel<00:00:52.980> has<00:00:53.100> been<00:00:53.219> mostly<00:00:53.640> dedicated<00:00:54.239> to
