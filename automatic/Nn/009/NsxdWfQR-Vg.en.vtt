00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.240 
that I mean if I want to bring up my

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:27.950 
that I mean if I want to bring up my
keyboard<00:04:25.400> then<00:04:26.400> go<00:04:26.580> and<00:04:26.849> I<00:04:27.570> like<00:04:27.780> this

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:27.960 
keyboard then go and I like this

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:28.340 
keyboard then go and I like this
keyboard

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:28.350 
keyboard

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:32.530 
keyboard
because<00:04:28.470> it<00:04:28.560> makes<00:04:28.710> noise<00:04:28.980> when<00:04:29.250> I<00:04:29.310> tap<00:04:29.430> on<00:04:29.820> it

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:32.540 

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:35.420 

so<00:04:33.540> I<00:04:33.570> like<00:04:33.870> that<00:04:34.110> it's<00:04:34.800> a<00:04:34.860> lot<00:04:34.980> better<00:04:35.160> than

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:35.430 
so I like that it's a lot better than

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:37.340 
so I like that it's a lot better than
the<00:04:35.550> one<00:04:35.760> that<00:04:35.940> just<00:04:35.970> comes<00:04:36.360> up<00:04:36.570> usually<00:04:36.840> and

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:37.350 
the one that just comes up usually and

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:40.990 
the one that just comes up usually and
then<00:04:38.220> of<00:04:38.520> course<00:04:38.550> let<00:04:39.540> me<00:04:39.660> close<00:04:39.840> out<00:04:40.080> of<00:04:40.140> this

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:41.000 
then of course let me close out of this

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.640 
then of course let me close out of this
and<00:04:42.000> then<00:04:42.270> of<00:04:42.390> course<00:04:42.420> upper<00:04:43.080> right<00:04:43.320> I<00:04:44.090> have<00:04:45.090> my

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:45.650

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:56.340 
will leave a link on how to do this in a

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:58.130 
will leave a link on how to do this in a
little<00:04:56.460> more<00:04:56.730> detail<00:04:57.390> because<00:04:57.870> i<00:04:57.960> know<00:04:58.020> the

00:04:58.130 --> 00:04:58.140 
little more detail because i know the

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:01.810 
little more detail because i know the
video<00:04:58.380> isn't<00:04:58.950> really<00:04:58.980> that<00:04:59.400> clear<00:04:59.850> and

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:01.820 
video isn't really that clear and

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:05.930 
video isn't really that clear and
basically<00:05:03.920> it<00:05:04.920> will<00:05:05.130> lead<00:05:05.340> you<00:05:05.550> to<00:05:05.580> the
