00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.970
 so system is heard long has it 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:08.790
 lasted because he pretty much took to 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.769
 until the color we played out 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.230
 unfortunately you can still see one 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.870
 little bubbles in the reservoir 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:17.460
 but few take days to be beautiful 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.520
 I think I can recognize quite well 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:23.029
 The color is due to the damage 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:23.029
 is really great 

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:32.730
 of course, that the housing 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.440
 the side is open is the conversion 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.320
 last album is actually because 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.989
 the temperature is a bit high so 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:47.329
 I've decided to go here now 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:47.329
 good springs 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:58.940
 i would like that and 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:58.940
 of course and put this protection 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:12.210
 as soon as the system turns off that is 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:15.660
 liquid completely clear once you 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.810
 now active to woman looks like that then 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:17.810
 out 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.469
 I am a beautiful effect 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:46.020
 to the other 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:06.050
 so should 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:08.910
 Widmer Paris called because of the Gibson 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:10.170
 decide, not all cards a 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.460
 The dealer told me that there is 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:18.160
 critical 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:19.390
 so I 'm from albus 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:23.560
 requested however came there 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:24.330
 strangely , not back to her 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:27.940
 to exchange 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:30.370
 because my dealer in advance of the first clicks 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:32.950
 again on the 16th 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:35.610
 halves again which still can 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.610
 do not exchange 

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:47.700
 not the problem that's how it looks 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:47.700
 whole now i hope you like it 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.689
 now also the light again 

00:03:00.689 --> 00:03:05.590
 squander 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:11.500
 the air bubbles that there a bit 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:18.060
 so far away again illuminates the 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:19.930
 really strong ok have fun watching 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.159
 you can you still others 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:22.480
 have not seen videos 

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:23.980
 we can not even take a look 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:28.109
 nice if a message leaves like 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.109
 I should like until then
