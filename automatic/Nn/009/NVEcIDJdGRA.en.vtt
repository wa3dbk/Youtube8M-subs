00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.340
 The roof of a small apartment. Finished condition of urethane coating waterproof. 

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:22.540
 The building is a 40-year-old three-story reinforced concrete house. 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:31.280
 Although the housing is strong and strong, explosions due to rebar corrosion, mortar, and floating of coating are everywhere. 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:38.700
 The part of the cement color was polished with a disk sander to expose the substrate and repaired with mortar. 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:45.760
 It was foundation repair over almost the whole outer wall. 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:17.320
 The veranda balcony also had a sheet waterproof later. 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:24.360
 To catch the sheet up to the parapet. In a state where Tochigi and the fence are removed. 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:49.920
 As the groundwork of the part which had been hidden in Tochigi has also deteriorated seriously, I repaired the corrosion prevention and mortar to the iron part. 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.340
 The same urethane waterproof on the second floor veranda. 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:17.220
 Most repairs were done with no cracks and no injection of epoxy resin. 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:51.260
 All fences were once removed to ensure the water resistance on the second floor veranda. 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:44.240
 I also replaced the front door in conjunction with the painting work. 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:10.980
 Replace the bay window, also repair mortar around. 

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:18.160
 Also repair the coating film that had floated from the sky. 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:05:05.460
 It was a scene from Yokohama where it took time and effort to repair the foundation rather than painting.
