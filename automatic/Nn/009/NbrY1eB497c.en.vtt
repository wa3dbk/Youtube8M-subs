00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:07.080
 jurian box from elshout has in his 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.849
 one of the mandemakers stadium of rkc 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.849
 waalwijk recreated 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.880
 with lego and we think that is facking 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:13.880
 epic 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:27.050
 Who 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:27.710
 a total rkc waalwijk stadium 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:31.430
 Scale 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:33.920
 what fuck yes hobby plus plus f and fan 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:36.559
 are from rkc say and 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:38.690
 fan of stadium tribes then it comes 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:39.980
 all nicely together i think i would 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:40.730
 must say i think it is really facking 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:42.920
 epic 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:44.629
 how long we have been doing this 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.970
 about eight months and then on 

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:49.010
 I would estimate to rent around 600 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:50.930
 the remains a hobby so I would actually 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:52.790
 don't exactly say chris how do you want 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:55.280
 gets in terms of mixing we are and how much 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:57.799
 pieces of lego are in it I would say 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.510
 I could be around 40,000 

00:00:57.799 --> 00:01:02.180
 sit pretty well 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:04.580
 how much it costs so much 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:05.750
 I was around 5000 euros what do you think 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:07.610
 Parents from the te thing back in the 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:10.340
 are living 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:11.720
 annoying but yes you can and others 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.130
 nowhere else and it started quite 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.470
 innocent with the 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:17.119
 a grandstand and that is slow 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:19.340
 go out flowing to the monster what you 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:19.880
 see how often you are on such a lego block 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.080
 go stand 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.119
 the cards from the past that you like that 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.439
 runs that barefoot wash that is 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:27.219
 just about the pain from hell 

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:30.079
 and build those things a few thousand times 

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:32.149
 at terrible i can get in on one 

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:34.570
 a pile of lego prey and then I notice 

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:34.570
 none of it 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:42.060
 julian besides that this is the most epic 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.330
 hobby is that a mature man can 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.920
 to have 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:45.930
 you also make a big fat money 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.909
 earn for example through sponsorship 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:51.420
 Well there is already something from your own driving school 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:53.100
 and your graphic design where it will 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.830
 the viewer does not surprise you that we 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.930
 the first official therefore pay pounder 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:01.110
 have gone from this fantastic stadium 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:04.790
 We now move on to the official moment of 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.790
 placing the coil forward 

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:15.299
 Oh 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:25.030
 what's next what now i actually have 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.500
 no concrete plans yet but on 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:28.209
 financially I think it will not 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:31.000
 become a new stadium unless the 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:33.459
 natural a football club or sponsor 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.500
 comes through who says of juliana 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:37.120
