00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.250
 I said Luis here and someone else uses the video 

00:00:08.679 --> 00:00:12.009
 on here 

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:17.320
 difficult here we are already in the ultimate team 

00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:19.840
 more precisely in uep and today's use 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.580
 is two teams but in my beauty 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:24.190
 fifa but I'm in a hurry 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:25.510
 I'm getting ahead requires you to all 

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:27.490
 bgs week 

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:30.940
 I'll show you both my 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:34.089
 bronze teams beauty two teams 

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:36.760
 That I did very cheaply is in my 

00:00:34.089 --> 00:00:38.199
 opinion a very very strong edition does not 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:41.739
 Let's have nobody play me. 

00:00:38.199 --> 00:00:46.620
 I'm going to use the players beauty 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:49.960
 starting with the beauty board and the rogan 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:53.109
 because two attackers with a lot of weight 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:55.420
 because so personal the bronze player 

00:00:53.109 --> 00:00:58.539
 Since you do not have much quality, they 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:01.149
 have to be at least agile then 

00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:03.460
 any bronze team see us if they will 

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:05.290
 at least a little bit of fish that 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:07.119
 there are some shortcomings that are 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:09.159
 more skillful type to me explained 

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:12.159
 which is the best bronze 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:14.680
 since fifa 13 and the best proof that 

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:15.729
 There is in my opinion the beauty is 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:20.890
 best bronze 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:23.770
 now how are you going to find out 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:25.869
 even if it is the best bronze being 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:27.700
 I really like the coaching has the 

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:30.159
 best players and he is one of the 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:33.850
 most liked it more expensive here when 

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:37.990
 began to stand at the base of five to eight 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:39.969
 thousand codes to pay for it 1,700 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:42.039
 Damn, I've been looking for a lot. 

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:43.870
 he very much and I did not want to spend 

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:47.620
 with the guy so 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:50.230
 the bronze card to be resold and have a 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:51.880
 of the fact that most of the 

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:54.850
 players that are here have done enough 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:56.110
 trade with them and is well worth 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:58.690
 many things 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:01.150
 So you're going to require me now to tell you 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:05.730
 I said my bronze team starts with the 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:11.110
 crushed with the cream of nine that crowned the 

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:13.330
 cast is the rogan beauty with which leonard 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:17.020
 which is the bass I really liked the player 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:18.910
 it is loud and fast and repeated no 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:21.310
 I really liked it, but it's good, right? 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:24.460
 the foster that if he is one of the best 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:27.690
 brass beaters then have 

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:30.340
 that having an English team is hector and 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:31.570
 websense web be a little slower but 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.270
 he is very tall 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:36.910
 wisdom he has a good fish 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:39.790
 kibon and the d'arco and also of a fish 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:42.100
 good physical good that he is very tall and 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:45.010
 goalkeeper the same occurring since fifa 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:47.890
 13 is the day lautas very good guy always 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:50.980
 I used it now and I will show my team 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:53.260
 mls I have two bronze teams 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:57.459
 My team deserves very good and I like it. 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:59.080
 enough of this team is also 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:03.459
 attackers with enough fish 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:06.850
 the funnel law we talk and the hard one lasts 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:08.380
 very good I play a game he is good at team and 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:11.200
 that's why it is higher than the 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:13.600
 item 3 I do not understand I do not understand this cup 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:16.090
 Brazil is taller and he is very good. 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:18.370
 very fast and kicks well until 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:20.770
 we sing felipe that is the brazilian he 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:23.080
 is a letter or covers not infrequently but it is 

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:24.850
 very good for me the best, right? 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:27.640
 leave in that position and have a good kick 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:29.709
 a good partner of 70 fish then he 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:33.400
 It's very good, I've been in a mane 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:35.320
 much fish and four of 13 dribble 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:38.080
 show that I have is not based on the 

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:41.260
 His slope is very good and very expensive. 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:44.110
 the drm we have brushed they stole one 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:48.640
 car can also be free is very good 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:52.330
 the créole strike reads those says the giba says 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:56.470
 also omitted the two also have enough 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:59.230
 fish and are high next beauty 1 and b5 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:02.560
 and setting 89 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:08.740
 if I'm not mistaken a stimulus can see 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:11.500
 and that in 1988 and by one side 

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:14.020
 right and one is x will already have left 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:16.959
 enough fish not all so based on 

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:18.760
 states of defense and physics for Jesus 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:23.080
 stand behind is very good 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:25.960
 the chain has 64 of defense and 67 header 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:28.180
 so he is very good well defensive and 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:29.530
 this use here that does not know him 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:32.050
 Google it 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:34.180
 puts then the name that goes lewis 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:37.210

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:40.240
 Very good, he is very tall so boot 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:42.610
 What will you understand and personal? 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:45.880
 This team is every player that you 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:48.640
 they saw it worth your while to buy 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:52.180
 and try to resell for more expensive 

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:54.280
 These attackers are half-way right. 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:55.870
 and wears glasses 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:59.169
 any player who overcomes any 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:01.180
 player since all the bronze team 

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:03.610
 given English, right? 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:05.590
 You'll be able to sell for guys for 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:08.200
 a very high price because they are all 

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:10.450
 good interest that both dividing staff 

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:12.400
 all about the two of bronze not uncommon 

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:15.100
 because brunão trees and why but 

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:17.950
 they are very good and a bronze not uncommon 

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:20.140
 if they are not worth as much as the others 

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:22.720
 they seem personal liked 

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:24.700
 if you liked the liquid favorite 

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:26.830
 Sorry, I did not catch me play beauty 

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:29.470
 but what I try to do what people 

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:31.960
 seen is much more worked but now 

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:35.319
 because I really want 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:38.590
 I think it's too short for you, video. 

00:05:35.319 --> 00:05:40.720

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:46.750
 twitter facebook and channel partnership 

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:49.000
 the facebook profile channel group is 

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:51.789

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:56.069
 video company is this 

00:05:51.789 --> 00:05:56.069
