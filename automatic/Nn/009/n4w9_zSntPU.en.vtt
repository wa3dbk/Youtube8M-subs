00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:04.259
 why do we meet with melquiades argüelles who is not an artisan 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:08.889
 in wood he elaborates more expensive my taste to know you face it close to his 

00:00:08.889 --> 00:00:10.179
 work with young people 

00:00:10.179 --> 00:00:14.039
 yes clear this month here is we work the biggest 

00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:15.929
 wood of 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.779
 of many years ago I dedicate myself to this 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.569
 percent equally not just bones in storms or paint 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:25.749
 the masks 

00:00:25.749 --> 00:00:28.239
 percent in the part of the operation 

00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:30.560
 what kind of teachers of which 8 hours 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:34.969
 this post can be a traditional mask createsse nalda de pilatos 

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:36.710
 as detailed 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:38.220
 a santiago 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:40.700
 the personal ones up 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.390
 the one that the parquet person wants 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:45.280
 desired posey with 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:49.110
 an image or X something like the ones I already have the images 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:54.970
 I can achieve that the mask that you want is very complicated to elaborate 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:56.590
 More expensive 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:00.180
 well, a very complicated path, simply that you have to have a bit of 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.240
 covered and dressed and the desire to do it 

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:06.240
 because if you do not have them, you do not 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:11.180
 what do you rely on as a messiah people translate inside the wood 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:14.180
 process common image as sumptuous 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:18.030
 this act at the beginning then first the wood 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.230
 as well 

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:22.560
 depends a lot on the size of a 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.750
 a trunk that you use 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.250
 and from the web here the one that you crossed us a sms the common 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.250
 no sir that's why it's like companies 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:38.500
 this pact here what is this 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:42.410
 the base what is missing is the margin more or less 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:45.410
 and it's what I kind of want to do 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.120
 perform 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.880
 look for this size 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.390
 that is appropriate to what will be the most expensive 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:56.260
 because if he makes her very big very young 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:57.810
 posse baeza cried out 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.930
 more or less after a large size that you want us more so that it looks good on 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:03.710
 costume 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:06.670
 it's like the meadow mask 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:08.939
 this 

00:02:08.939 --> 00:02:11.939
 we see it on screen 

00:02:11.939 --> 00:02:13.919
 men one more or less adapted 

00:02:13.919 --> 00:02:15.749
 to 

00:02:15.749 --> 00:02:18.919
 Larger, rougher type of disguise 

00:02:18.919 --> 00:02:20.680
 to be a little more real 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.589
 same this 

00:02:22.589 --> 00:02:24.899
 spin you take small 

00:02:24.899 --> 00:02:27.919
 here yes you have to explain a little pop less bad 

00:02:27.919 --> 00:02:30.919
 so that it looks like a knowledge 

00:02:31.419 --> 00:02:36.399
 it's like when you grab a bigger wood piscila 

00:02:36.399 --> 00:02:38.809
 you want to modify something whatever 

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:41.809
 I want a beginning yes it's some things 

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:44.049
 how will it be 

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:45.120
 you will leave 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.729
 And if it does not, it does not 

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:48.759
 pickett and hardens 

00:02:48.759 --> 00:02:50.609
 nelson new work 

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:53.279
 for a finished product like a pet 

00:02:53.279 --> 00:02:56.689
 for about a day and a half or so 

00:02:56.689 --> 00:03:00.650
 a week later this one and a half days of getting 

00:03:01.399 --> 00:03:03.019
 dedicated to doing it 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:06.399
 because if you leave it min, yes no if you stop doing it 

00:03:07.039 --> 00:03:09.239
 proposal for a week 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:13.379
 three four five days but yes they do in cars a day and a half nothing more 

00:03:13.969 --> 00:03:17.599
 this kind of tools the musket cocopa have different from their 

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:18.599
 blades 

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:22.260
 what is your speechless coupon called a city called 

00:03:23.119 --> 00:03:26.409
 this tavo see a key cha ibeas 

00:03:27.429 --> 00:03:28.549
 a hill hotel 

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:30.329
 a machete 

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:31.310
 nothing else 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:32.779
 this 

00:03:32.779 --> 00:03:33.919
 and a lot of creativity 

00:03:33.919 --> 00:03:35.719
 it's been a long time 

00:03:35.719 --> 00:03:39.089
 this simply you also have to have the desire to do it 

00:03:40.139 --> 00:03:42.189
 because without wanting you do not 

00:03:42.189 --> 00:03:44.369
 for five are of wood 

00:03:44.369 --> 00:03:47.379
 you know how you see the ideal way 

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:50.989
 so to make protective masks as you know it is legal 

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:56.359
 for me this one 

00:03:56.359 --> 00:03:59.359
 Green wood is very good because it is very soft 

00:04:00.389 --> 00:04:01.500
 and so it is 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.609
 what and how do you want 

00:04:03.609 --> 00:04:08.139
 but for him nine concessions were painted to work it after determining 

00:04:08.139 --> 00:04:09.309
 a mask 

00:04:09.309 --> 00:04:11.979
 How is it going 

00:04:11.979 --> 00:04:15.749
 you can not paint it green because you can not paint because you vote 

00:04:15.749 --> 00:04:16.819
 painting 

00:04:16.819 --> 00:04:18.709
 you have to choose a wood 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:19.699
 that is in 

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:22.039

00:04:35.229 --> 00:04:36.940
 this in fact 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:38.139
 this 

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:41.460
