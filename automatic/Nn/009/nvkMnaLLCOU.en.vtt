 No, this can not happen, and it's okay. 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.150
 so do not take this risk 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:15.390

 Do not let happen to you, then. 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:26.420
 watch the part open see inside see 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:30.450
 outwardly understood if it is a seam 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:34.170
 pass have this care passes the speed or 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:36.810
 zig zag or the suddenly I the scissors 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:39.090
 you know how to finish do it 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:42.990
 that cleaning does not leave hanging line 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:44.670
 iron is all the details make 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.759
 much difference 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:50.220
 sometimes the person speaks like this is the law I will 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:51.899
 to finish well because it's not right 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.509
 in a world will see 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:57.479
 sometimes people buy from you 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:02:00.600
 This piece to take shows she goes. 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:02.130
 neglect and will see the beginning can can 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.100
 can not happen 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:09.060
 And then she speaks in a half-show of this. 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:11.970
 Work, then, no, you just have to 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:15.330
 receive compliments indications 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:17.880
 nor praise more and more orders 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:20.310
 a detail that we let pass is 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:23.750
 least one customer or less many 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:25.260
 customers and then finishing is 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.750
 very important 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.730
 I said I think in the first video I 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.080
 the finishing begins on the purchase of the 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.940
 material 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:36.690
 it's not you're buying good stuff 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:39.000
 né you organized did the piece with 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:42.990
 calm in the organized place had that 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:46.230
 super idea and made the cool finish tá 

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:48.750
 sold is sold 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:51.510
 Okay, so you do not have to fear it's a 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:54.270
 ask that more day less day people 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:56.160
 they will buy or it is an order 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:58.770
 the person will have air today because you 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:01.050
 took care of yourself 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:03.690
 Of course we can be more careful. 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:06.060
 We can do more than 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:09.680
 packaging ne 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:15.420
 is to put a pretty sticker know 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:20.010
 put on a tie put on is the plastic 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:22.350
 Silk paper knows all this is a clear is 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:26.880
 It costs more than you'll get just that 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:29.310
 on the other hand and the customer's reaction is 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:32.100
 noticing care you had this is 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:34.739
 Priceless they're priceless person 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:38.610
 waiting maceió 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:41.850
 here if you order but you will not you will not 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:45.600
 will you do that will you pack will 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:49.019
 wrap a little paper will not put 

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:53.220
 a bag you had a right to tape 

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:56.370
 Put your card on, then all this 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:59.040
 is engage the customer and the customer loyalty 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:01.980
 he will tell you look can buy 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:04.500
 I indicate it's all we want. 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:06.360
 then it is mainly when you are in the 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:10.170
 At first we want to win the customer. 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:12.090
 You know when I started I did not have this 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:14.400
 social networking thing as it has today so 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:18.840
 Strong, then I said certainly 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:20.310
 I wrote down the name of the client as well 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:23.160
 recommend a box okay 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:24.970

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:28.370

 understood and there is that moment of you 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:33.170

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:35.930

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:39.800

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:42.620
 You know to always have the customer. 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:44.810
 Remembering me, this is the marketing. 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:46.460
 nice, we end up getting neither 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:48.950
 Pull on saquism, you end up getting friends. 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:52.190
 customer is very cool customer relies 

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:54.560
 in you and want to hear your tips that is 

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:57.530
 listening is what you're doing again 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:05:00.170
 each and every one just ends up feel 

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:02.900

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:04.850
 I was calling on your birthday, it's very good, right? 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:07.340
 today we talk but through networks 

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:09.230
 social as I said but it's cool you 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:12.830
 this approach generates a 

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:17.120
 confidence this creates credibility 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:21.110
 cool, you 're so capriche you've seen yourself so far 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:25.850
 We talked about the beginning of everything until the 

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:28.850
 end of the piece knows then a cycle is e 

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:31.490
 each step can not be pasted understood 

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:34.250
 if you like wrong material or if you 

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:37.400
 is not in a suitable place to work 

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:41.270
 is something wrong is no longer this 

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:43.010

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:50.720
 not with that foot with that 

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:53.570
 distrust that she liked that it will be that 

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:56.300
 She's going to talk, you do not have to deliver 

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:58.790
 the quiet talking piece can open can 

00:05:56.300 --> 00:06:00.290
 to use underneath it is by itself the 

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:05.150
 reverse 

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:07.880
