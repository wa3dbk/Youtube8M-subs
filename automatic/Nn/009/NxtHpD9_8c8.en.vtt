00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:15.089
 ingredients that we have next 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:17.390
 the first potatoes we have peeled between 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:21.869
 4 and 5 potatoes depending on the size 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:25.910
 chopped and cut into cachelos then 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:29.310
 we will need garlic onion pepper 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:32.220
 chorizo ​​and a little a teaspoon of 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:35.070
 paprika all this we will apply 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:37.020
 well chopped as we see the pepper in 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.110
 larger pieces while the garlic and 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:42.930
 the onion well chopped the chorizo ​​with 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.730
 that are sliced ​​is enough once 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.039
 let's have all the ingredients we are going to 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.649
 put in a pan a little 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.870
 oil and the first ingredients that 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:54.390
 would be the garlic the onion and the pepper 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:57.130
 all we will sear until 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.350
 have a good color 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:02.860
 we already have in the pot the 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:06.630
 ingredients cast first 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:09.010
 the onion the garlic and the red pepper 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.820
 we are going to have them like that for about 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:15.010
 minutes until they are completely brown 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:17.800
 stirring from time to time so that it 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:22.940
 mix flavors well when this 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:25.100
 we will have to add chorizo 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:27.860
 we added the chorizo ​​and now it's 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:30.710
 taking a reddish color when everything is 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:33.110
 well mixed we will add the potatoes and 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:36.100
 we fry them for about 5 minutes 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:38.930
 approximately before adding the water 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:40.540
 we keep it that way now for about 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:42.850
 minutes 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:45.580
 the potatoes and van have already been incorporated 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:47.300
 taking also a reddish color what 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:51.350
 we move 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:54.530
 in the pot let's water for about 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:57.290
 minutes the potatoes and later 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:59.270
 we will add the water we can incorporate 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:01.880
 also a bay leaf to give 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:05.000
 taste and then you just have to let it cook 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:07.640
 over a fairly cheerful fire until they are 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.039
 made the potatoes 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:12.080
 we have already added water and are 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:14.450
 baking the potatoes in 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.610
 approximately 15 minutes will be but 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:18.200
 it's just a matter of trying them and when 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:21.840
 we seem to be withdrawing them from 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:25.740
 fire, we will only have to add 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:29.010
 the paprika right now we are going to do it 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:31.910
 the teaspoon of paprika and also the 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.910
 bay leaves 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:38.150
 that give it a very good taste with that 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:40.640
 we will have finished the dish will only be 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:42.970
 wait for the potatoes to be made and 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.580
 to serve 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:47.350
 and potatoes are already well Rioja 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:50.260
 is how the finished dish looks after 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:52.240
 about 20 minutes approximately 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:54.220
 cooking the potatoes simply 

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:57.160
 We will have to test them and when they are 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:59.800
 removed from the fire and serve is a 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:02.440
 pretty elaborate dish but it does not stop 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:04.570

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:08.310
