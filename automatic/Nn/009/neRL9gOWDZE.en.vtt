record<00:00:18.900> I<00:00:19.170> think<00:00:19.230> it's<00:00:19.680> an<00:00:19.830> effective<00:00:20.340> program

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:20.779 
record I think it's an effective program

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:23.599 
record I think it's an effective program
but<00:00:21.779> like<00:00:21.960> any<00:00:22.230> program<00:00:22.500> it<00:00:23.010> can<00:00:23.220> be<00:00:23.369> miss

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
but like any program it can be miss

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.230 
but like any program it can be miss
applied<00:00:24.029> or<00:00:24.449> abused<00:00:25.170> or<00:00:25.500> misused<00:00:25.939> and<00:00:26.939> things

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
feels okay

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.569 
feels okay
just<00:00:48.539> keep<00:00:48.780> doing<00:00:49.170> it<00:00:49.289> okay<00:00:49.800> there<00:00:50.190> are<00:00:50.309> some

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
just keep doing it okay there are some

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.450 
just keep doing it okay there are some
you<00:00:51.239> know<00:00:51.390> these<00:00:52.020> potential<00:00:52.980> pitfalls

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
you know these potential pitfalls

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.600 
you know these potential pitfalls
actually<00:00:54.300> are<00:00:54.570> okay<00:00:55.199> for<00:00:55.230> some<00:00:55.710> people<00:00:56.100> but

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
actually are okay for some people but

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.069 
actually are okay for some people but
for<00:00:56.670> most<00:00:56.969> people<00:00:57.390> I<00:00:57.480> think<00:00:57.750> they're<00:00:57.930> going<00:00:58.020> to

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
for most people I think they're going to

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.770 
for most people I think they're going to
cause<00:00:58.320> trouble<00:00:58.890> so<00:00:59.579> without<00:00:59.850> further<00:01:00.149> ado

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
cause trouble so without further ado

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.860 
cause trouble so without further ado
kids<00:01:01.170> let<00:01:01.440> me<00:01:01.590> get<00:01:01.800> unto<00:01:02.160> the<00:01:02.280> point

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
kids let me get unto the point

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.480 
kids let me get unto the point
the<00:01:04.290> first<00:01:04.739> one<00:01:05.129> is<00:01:06.590> boring<00:01:07.590> but<00:01:07.979> big

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
the first one is boring but big

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.570 
the first one is boring but big
deadlifts<00:01:09.479> of<00:01:09.659> five<00:01:09.990> by<00:01:10.290> ten<00:01:10.590> on<00:01:10.920> deadlifts

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
deadlifts of five by ten on deadlifts

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:17.359 
deadlifts of five by ten on deadlifts
now<00:01:12.330> I<00:01:12.750> think<00:01:13.590> you<00:01:14.130> know<00:01:14.250> as<00:01:14.460> a<00:01:15.979> novice<00:01:16.979> to

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
now I think you know as a novice to

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.840 
now I think you know as a novice to
early<00:01:17.759> intermediate<00:01:18.799> lifter<00:01:19.799> that<00:01:19.830> you<00:01:20.610> do

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
early intermediate lifter that you do

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.719 
early intermediate lifter that you do
need<00:01:21.030> some<00:01:21.330> reps<00:01:21.570> on<00:01:21.810> deadlift<00:01:22.259> but<00:01:22.500> I'm<00:01:23.340> not<00:01:23.670> a

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
need some reps on deadlift but I'm not a

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.719 
need some reps on deadlift but I'm not a
big<00:01:23.970> fan<00:01:24.299> of<00:01:24.330> doing<00:01:24.659> 5<00:01:25.080> sets<00:01:25.470> of<00:01:25.619> 10<00:01:26.100> reps<00:01:26.460> on

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
big fan of doing 5 sets of 10 reps on

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.859 
big fan of doing 5 sets of 10 reps on
deadlifts<00:01:27.570> I<00:01:28.100> think<00:01:29.100> you<00:01:29.400> would<00:01:30.030> be<00:01:30.329> better

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
deadlifts I think you would be better

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.429 
deadlifts I think you would be better
served<00:01:31.290> with<00:01:31.619> doing<00:01:31.950> fewer<00:01:32.369> reps<00:01:32.759> per<00:01:33.060> set<00:01:33.439> so

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
served with doing fewer reps per set so

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:38.330 
served with doing fewer reps per set so
how<00:01:34.860> many<00:01:34.920> is<00:01:35.670> really<00:01:36.479> up<00:01:36.659> to<00:01:36.900> you<00:01:37.170> but<00:01:37.439> I'm

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
how many is really up to you but I'm

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.850 
how many is really up to you but I'm
typically<00:01:39.030> not<00:01:39.119> a<00:01:39.329> fan<00:01:39.630> of<00:01:39.659> the<00:01:39.930> boring<00:01:40.350> but

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
typically not a fan of the boring but

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.920 
typically not a fan of the boring but

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:20.820 
assistance work so that's one thing I

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:22.670

the squats and bench - they're all out
set<00:02:44.070> and<00:02:44.400> then<00:02:44.940> they'll<00:02:45.150> go<00:02:45.360> straight<00:02:45.750> to

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
set and then they'll go straight to

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:51.290

their<00:02:47.040> assistants<00:02:47.880> work<00:02:48.380> now<00:02:49.380> I<00:02:49.740> do<00:02:50.310> not<00:02:50.880> think

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:51.300 
their assistants work now I do not think

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:54.070 
their assistants work now I do not think
that<00:02:51.480> that<00:02:51.960> one<00:02:52.350> working<00:02:52.680> set<00:02:53.190> per<00:02:53.460> week<00:02:53.730> on

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:54.080 
that that one working set per week on

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:58.160 
that that one working set per week on
squats<00:02:55.080> and<00:02:55.500> on<00:02:56.220> bench<00:02:56.550> is<00:02:56.880> enough<00:02:57.630> squatting

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
squats and on bench is enough squatting

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.140 
squats and on bench is enough squatting
and<00:02:58.290> benching<00:02:58.680> for<00:02:58.860> you<00:02:58.950> each<00:02:59.190> week<00:02:59.460> I<00:02:59.730> don't

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
and benching for you each week I don't

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.300 
and benching for you each week I don't
think<00:03:00.390> that's<00:03:00.570> enough<00:03:00.810> work<00:03:01.080> if<00:03:01.350> you're<00:03:02.190> going

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
think that's enough work if you're going

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.190 
think that's enough work if you're going
to<00:03:02.400> build<00:03:02.580> I<00:03:02.850> think<00:03:02.940> you<00:03:03.420> should<00:03:03.600> build<00:03:03.810> up<00:03:04.050> to

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
to build I think you should build up to

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.830 
to build I think you should build up to
that<00:03:04.230> and<00:03:04.650> then<00:03:05.310> you<00:03:05.940> either<00:03:06.150> do<00:03:06.450> more<00:03:06.810> of

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
that and then you either do more of

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.620 
that and then you either do more of
those<00:03:07.350> types<00:03:07.620> of<00:03:07.830> exercises<00:03:08.370> squats<00:03:09.000> or<00:03:09.270> bench

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
those types of exercises squats or bench

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:12.920 
those types of exercises squats or bench
or<00:03:09.990> you<00:03:10.860> do<00:03:11.010> an<00:03:11.160> assistance<00:03:11.760> where<00:03:12.060> systems

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
or you do an assistance where systems

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.290 
or you do an assistance where systems
