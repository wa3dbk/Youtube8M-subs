00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:04.490
 WGL The Grand Finals World Series is both wonderful and crazy 

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:08.740
 This event, the birth of the new Wargaming.net League champion 

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:12.620
 It also brings to the world a lot of dazzling, thrilling and brilliant moments. 

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:14.880
 Here are 10 classic clips 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.610
 The chances of the following situations are minimal 

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:23.370
 A self-propelled gun actually reversed the situation 

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:26.160
 This lucky one is Dyador. 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:28.960
 Dyador and his cannon struck 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.688
 - On! Caught him! - Can he keep up? 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:32.333
 - He has done it! - Well done! 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.010
 In the area of ​​Simorsdorf, you should not touch some places. 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:41.840
 Unless you want to take the lead 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.360
 The taste of the gunfire of Virtus.PRO 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:45.780
 They are stared 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.530
 Elevate's plan is over, they have to... 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:50.970
 Hey, GeeForcer, see how bad he is! 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:52.970
 1.4k, he didn’t sing. 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:03.370
 Even if your chariot is almost ruined, you will never give up. 

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:08.330
 Constant threats like eAlien require quite sophisticated skills 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.160
 Ealien faces 2 dozens, Uralfish discovers Cowthief 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:14.250
 Kazna sent a big gift from a distance, Ealien kills and kills 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.490
 He is dancing and delaying time 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:17.300
 He got 1.2k damage 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:18.680
 Look at where he moved 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:19.740
 This is not easy to play. 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.360
 It’s amazing performance 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.200
 Fast, Ealien is finally dead. 

00:01:29.133 --> 00:01:31.088
 JustCaus perseveringly attacks 

00:01:31.111 --> 00:01:33.022
 Risking the disintegration of the vehicle or attacking 

00:01:33.066 --> 00:01:34.933
 Even if the guns are loud 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:38.170
 JustCauz, Coca_Cola and koreetz survived 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:40.480
 Kirill is running out of blood, and it’s over again. 

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:41.540
 JustCauz hit it up. 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:45.060
 Look at this blood volume, hey! JustCauz solved him. 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.450
 Only LeBwa is left now. 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.400
 Why in the Hollywood movie 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:55.290
 The bomb was always removed in the last second? 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.980
 The players of SC6 officially realized today. 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:58.940
 The same thrilling pressure as in the movie 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:01:59.720
 Countdown 10 seconds 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:01.020
 They can't stay nearby 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.400
 9 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:02.100
 They hid in the car 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.222
 - 8 - They know 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:04.240
 6 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:05.320
 Like playing a football game 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:06.480
 They collided to stop them 

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:07.140
 Hiding in the vehicle 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.955
 - You love you - 3! 2! 

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:09.977
 1! 

00:02:10.066 --> 00:02:10.720
 Someone... 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.777
 - Oh! Reset! Reset! - It is twice the reset time! 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.890
 Breaking armor causes huge damage? 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.960
 The T49 cannon is not very reliable, you know 

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:27.100
 But look at how Creative uses it. 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:29.250
 You may start to believe that there is a miracle in the world. 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:34.820
 Wow, finally, a heavy gun 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:36.550
 800, 1000 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:38.200
 1100 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:39.350
 This is just the power of a hair 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:42.640
 JustCreat1ve sent a shot to Coca_Cola. 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:48.840
 MT-25 is not resistant 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:52.020
 But let's see how koreetz can be fully played. 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:53.710
 Become a powerful force in his team 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.680
 Statik is in a rather dangerous position 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.000
 He was captured 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.910
 Single shadow 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:00.950
 It’s too dangerous here. 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:02.530
 Koreetz has penetrated 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.680
 Maybe he can cause some damage here. 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:05.880
 Statik is going to die. 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.310
 Almost in vain 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:09.440
 Break_neck packed up him 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.680
 But then I have to see what he wants to do now. 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:19.020
 A sixth-order light chariot is on the eighth-order fleet. 

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:20.350
 need help 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:23.220
 This may be too boring for Monti. 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:24.970
 Oh! Nightmare is a big problem here. 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:27.220
 Look at how miserable he is, only two drops of blood 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:29.710
 Monti is easy to get, now he is looking for opportunities... 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:32.300
 Play a big one 

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:34.360
 The next thing that hangs up is Reflection. 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:41.150
 When you and the two teammates meet the five world champions 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:43.270
 How to fight? 

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:45.620
 Awaken the spirit of the king in your body! 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.180
 Like Hellraisers 

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:49.510
 Hellraisers has no answer 

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:51.000
 Anatolich can only retreat 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
 But when you look at Straik, he is acting. 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.310
 See if there is anything that can change the situation 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:58.070
 The enemy is in front of you, killing two consecutive kills 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:01.080
 As you can see, some of the chariots are still conservative. 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:02.800
 Neskwi detour behind but Straik 

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:03.560
 Attack again 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:05.150
 But DYADOR is in the upper hand 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:07.720
 Inexplicably caught in 2 to 2 scenes 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:09.320
 And Straik has very low blood volume. 

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:11.400
 DYADOR can be everything with one shot 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:12.520
 coming! 

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:13.960
 Angel_Killer 1 to 2 

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:16.810
 Hellraisers almost reversed the big picture 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:19.400
 Na'Vi is still under control, can they complete the task? 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:20.880
 Angel_killer takes one! 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:22.320
 But he is dead! ! 

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:29.730
 The most valuable picture of the final battle will not be a unique show. 

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:30.670
 But a dramatic combination of scenes 

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:33.870
 Nine deaths, a miracle 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:36.240
 Of course, there are lolwo's superb skills. 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:40.280
 As a good player, of course you have to stand up for your team. 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:41.690
 He paused to deny this fact 

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:43.110
 But hey! He was caught too early 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:45.920
 He did spy on the situation first, a beautiful blow. 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:50.580
 This is not a small circle, the target appears, the turret is in place. 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:52.480
 He grabbed the opportunity... Wow! 

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:53.800
 A smashing blow!
