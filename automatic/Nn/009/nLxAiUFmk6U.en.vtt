almost<00:04:53.320> feels<00:04:53.740> like<00:04:54.010> maybe<00:04:54.430> an<00:04:54.580> illusionist

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:55.150 
almost feels like maybe an illusionist

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:57.810 
almost feels like maybe an illusionist
stock<00:04:55.539> so<00:04:56.440> it's<00:04:56.710> definitely<00:04:57.160> a<00:04:57.250> it's
