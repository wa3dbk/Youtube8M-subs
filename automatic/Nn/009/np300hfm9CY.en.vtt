00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.610 
stuff because right when you start the
game<00:03:07.830> you<00:03:08.480> can<00:03:09.480> just<00:03:09.630> call<00:03:09.810> a<00:03:09.870> line<00:03:10.230> in<00:03:10.470> my

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
game you can just call a line in my

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.890 
game you can just call a line in my
right<00:03:10.890> do<00:03:11.100> like<00:03:11.280> half<00:03:11.520> the<00:03:11.730> map<00:03:11.940> and<00:03:12.240> then<00:03:12.780> if

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
now in this map the spawn points are

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:31.040 
now in this map the spawn points are
basically<00:03:27.180> the<00:03:27.239> back<00:03:27.570> corners<00:03:28.190> so<00:03:29.190> on<00:03:30.050> I'm

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:31.050 
basically the back corners so on I'm

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:32.479 
basically the back corners so on I'm
going<00:03:31.170> to<00:03:31.260> go<00:03:31.350> back<00:03:31.500> to<00:03:31.650> this<00:03:31.770> to<00:03:32.040> their<00:03:32.190> spawn

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:32.489 
going to go back to this to their spawn

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:37.340 
going to go back to this to their spawn
point<00:03:32.790> right<00:03:33.000> now<00:03:35.120> and<00:03:36.120> see<00:03:36.930> if<00:03:36.959> I<00:03:37.110> can<00:03:37.230> get

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:37.350 
point right now and see if I can get

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:39.020 
point right now and see if I can get
some<00:03:37.410> kills<00:03:37.739> I've<00:03:38.160> all<00:03:38.370> going<00:03:38.580> to<00:03:38.640> spawn<00:03:38.880> right

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
some kills I've all going to spawn right

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:43.200 
some kills I've all going to spawn right
now

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:43.210 

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:45.120 

right<00:03:43.810> now<00:03:43.960> I<00:03:44.170> think<00:03:44.200> I<00:03:44.530> think<00:03:44.740> this<00:03:44.800> is<00:03:44.860> when<00:03:45.100> I

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:45.130 
right now I think I think this is when I

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:47.790 
right now I think I think this is when I
start<00:03:45.430> getting<00:03:45.910> all<00:03:46.060> my<00:03:46.210> death<00:03:46.710> yeah<00:03:47.710> because

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:49.450 
I keep going back there to try to get

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:54.240 
I keep going back there to try to get
the<00:03:49.570> spawn<00:03:49.840> kills<00:03:52.110> but<00:03:53.110> I<00:03:53.140> get<00:03:53.650> a<00:03:53.680> triple<00:03:54.100> kill

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:54.250 
the spawn kills but I get a triple kill

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:57.240
