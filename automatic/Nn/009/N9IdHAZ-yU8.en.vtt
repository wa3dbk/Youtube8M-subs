the stuff with the game and how they can
get<00:00:08.429> animations<00:00:09.030> into<00:00:09.269> the<00:00:09.330> game<00:00:09.510> a<00:00:10.050> day<00:00:10.860> after

recording or something like that which
is<00:00:12.870> crazy<00:00:13.139> insane<00:00:13.740> for<00:00:14.429> development

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
is crazy insane for development

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.790 
is crazy insane for development
standards<00:00:15.210> and<00:00:15.450> is<00:00:15.690> hopefully<00:00:16.230> you<00:00:16.500> know<00:00:16.619> a

standards and is hopefully you know a
really<00:00:17.430> good<00:00:17.640> idea<00:00:17.699> for<00:00:18.029> dynamic<00:00:18.420> updates

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
really good idea for dynamic updates

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.679 
really good idea for dynamic updates
they<00:00:19.500> talked<00:00:19.830> a<00:00:19.949> lot<00:00:20.130> about<00:00:20.189> synergy<00:00:20.670> and<00:00:21.270> how

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
they have all these metrics about how

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.470 
they have all these metrics about how

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:36.380 
and I came up with this idea that I want
to<00:00:35.489> share<00:00:35.550> with<00:00:35.700> you<00:00:35.880> guys<00:00:35.910> and<00:00:36.239> hopefully

neea people that are going to be

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.310 
neea people that are going to be
listening<00:00:38.309> in<00:00:38.430> which<00:00:39.090> is<00:00:39.210> doubtful<00:00:39.570> but<00:00:39.750> hey<00:00:40.290> i

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
listening in which is doubtful but hey i

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.760 
listening in which is doubtful but hey i
can<00:00:40.620> try<00:00:40.770> anyway<00:00:41.510> my<00:00:42.510> idea<00:00:42.870> is<00:00:42.930> dynamic

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
can try anyway my idea is dynamic

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.680 
can try anyway my idea is dynamic
hotspots<00:00:44.899> now<00:00:46.370> we've<00:00:47.370> seen<00:00:47.610> this<00:00:47.760> with<00:00:48.000> arcade

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
hotspots now we've seen this with arcade

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.450 
hotspots now we've seen this with arcade
games<00:00:48.930> before<00:00:49.140> where<00:00:49.559> you<00:00:49.590> go<00:00:49.920> and<00:00:50.100> shoot<00:00:50.280> at<00:00:50.430> a

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
games before where you go and shoot at a

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:51.799 
games before where you go and shoot at a
certain<00:00:50.670> point<00:00:50.910> you<00:00:51.090> get<00:00:51.180> a<00:00:51.239> extra<00:00:51.390> point

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
certain point you get a extra point

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.020 
certain point you get a extra point
boost<00:00:52.020> or<00:00:52.230> something<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:53.460> way<00:00:53.610> I've<00:00:53.789> seen

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
boost or something the way I've seen

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.840 
boost or something the way I've seen
this<00:00:54.120> in<00:00:54.239> a<00:00:54.329> simulation<00:00:54.809> context<00:00:55.620> is<00:00:55.789> when<00:00:56.789> you

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
this in a simulation context is when you

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.580 
this in a simulation context is when you
have<00:00:57.030> synergy<00:00:57.539> if<00:00:57.719> you<00:00:57.809> guys<00:00:57.930> remember<00:00:58.050> NBA

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
have synergy if you guys remember NBA

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.849 
have synergy if you guys remember NBA
live<00:00:58.859> 09<00:00:59.629> when<00:01:00.629> you<00:01:00.690> had<00:01:00.809> synergy<00:01:01.379> in<00:01:01.680> that

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
live 09 when you had synergy in that

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.889 
live 09 when you had synergy in that
game<00:01:02.129> it<00:01:02.820> was<00:01:02.969> just<00:01:03.090> these<00:01:03.180> stats<00:01:03.570> that<00:01:03.780> were

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
game it was just these stats that were

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.329 
game it was just these stats that were
just<00:01:03.989> showing<00:01:04.229> up<00:01:04.470> at<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:04.710> top<00:01:04.890> of<00:01:04.949> the<00:01:05.189> screen

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
just showing up at the top of the screen

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.789 
just showing up at the top of the screen
and<00:01:05.729> that<00:01:06.210> didn't<00:01:06.479> really<00:01:06.510> mean<00:01:06.960> crap<00:01:07.260> to<00:01:07.500> me<00:01:07.650> I

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
and that didn't really mean crap to me I

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.770 
and that didn't really mean crap to me I
get<00:01:08.549> the<00:01:08.640> ball<00:01:08.790> of<00:01:08.909> the<00:01:08.970> Rondo<00:01:09.299> and<00:01:09.420> says<00:01:09.600> I'm

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
get the ball of the Rondo and says I'm

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.870 
get the ball of the Rondo and says I'm
gonna<00:01:09.930> have<00:01:10.260> to<00:01:10.409> I<00:01:10.530> that<00:01:10.799> normally<00:01:11.250> Rondo<00:01:11.640> goes

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
gonna have to I that normally Rondo goes

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.250 
gonna have to I that normally Rondo goes
to<00:01:12.060> his<00:01:12.150> right<00:01:12.210> fifty-four<00:01:12.840> percent<00:01:12.869> of<00:01:13.200> the

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
to his right fifty-four percent of the

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.280 
to his right fifty-four percent of the
time<00:01:13.439> that<00:01:14.369> means<00:01:14.549> nothing<00:01:15.030> that<00:01:15.570> that<00:01:16.080> means

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
time that means nothing that that means

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.770 
time that means nothing that that means
nothing<00:01:17.009> to<00:01:17.220> me<00:01:17.340> what<00:01:18.150> would<00:01:18.270> make<00:01:18.420> more<00:01:18.720> sense

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
nothing to me what would make more sense

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.880 
nothing to me what would make more sense
is<00:01:19.470> if<00:01:20.310> dynamically<00:01:21.180> you<00:01:22.170> get<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:22.470> ball<00:01:22.650> with

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
is if dynamically you get the ball with

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.859 
is if dynamically you get the ball with
Rondo<00:01:23.400> and<00:01:23.580> then<00:01:24.119> like<00:01:24.270> a<00:01:24.299> little<00:01:24.630> red

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
Rondo and then like a little red

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.679 
Rondo and then like a little red
highlight<00:01:25.530> shows<00:01:26.009> up<00:01:26.220> on<00:01:26.340> the<00:01:26.460> court<00:01:26.790> showing
