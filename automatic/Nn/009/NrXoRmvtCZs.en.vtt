00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.190 
your imagination or your visualization
this<00:02:20.650> way<00:02:20.920> it<00:02:21.610> makes<00:02:21.820> a<00:02:22.000> real<00:02:22.240> difference<00:02:23.050> to

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
this way it makes a real difference to

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.170 
this way it makes a real difference to
the<00:02:23.440> way<00:02:23.560> your<00:02:23.740> body<00:02:23.950> functions<00:02:24.520> and<00:02:24.880> to<00:02:25.090> the

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
the way your body functions and to the

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:28.110 
the way your body functions and to the
activity<00:02:25.780> of<00:02:25.810> the<00:02:26.290> nerves<00:02:27.010> and<00:02:27.370> cells<00:02:27.670> into

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
activity of the nerves and cells into

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.390 
activity of the nerves and cells into
the<00:02:28.240> different<00:02:28.540> parts<00:02:28.570> of<00:02:28.930> your<00:02:29.050> body<00:02:29.260> and<00:02:29.500> so

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
the different parts of your body and so

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.010 
the different parts of your body and so
it<00:02:30.520> will<00:02:30.700> make<00:02:30.970> them<00:02:31.210> more<00:02:31.390> filled<00:02:31.780> with

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:32.020 
it will make them more filled with

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:35.160 
it will make them more filled with
energy<00:02:32.380> and<00:02:33.030> prepare<00:02:34.030> you<00:02:34.210> to<00:02:34.390> circulate<00:02:35.020> the

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
energy and prepare you to circulate the

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:38.310 
energy and prepare you to circulate the
energy<00:02:35.560> through<00:02:35.830> your<00:02:35.950> body<00:02:36.870> so<00:02:37.870> finally

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:38.320 
energy through your body so finally

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:40.290 
energy through your body so finally
after<00:02:38.470> you've<00:02:38.770> pushed<00:02:39.100> to<00:02:39.430> the<00:02:39.580> sides<00:02:39.910> and

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:40.300 
after you've pushed to the sides and

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
after you've pushed to the sides and
pushed<00:02:41.260> up<00:02:41.560> and<00:02:41.890> down<00:02:42.330> the<00:02:43.330> last<00:02:43.630> direction

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:44.320 
pushed up and down the last direction

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:45.990 
pushed up and down the last direction
that<00:02:44.440> you<00:02:44.620> will<00:02:44.740> push<00:02:45.070> is<00:02:45.400> you're<00:02:45.670> going<00:02:45.880> to

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
that you will push is you're going to

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.810 
that you will push is you're going to
push<00:02:46.240> to<00:02:46.270> the<00:02:46.450> front<00:02:46.930> in<00:02:47.290> back<00:02:47.710> you're<00:02:48.640> going

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:48.820 
push to the front in back you're going

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:52.410 
push to the front in back you're going
to<00:02:48.940> do<00:02:49.150> this<00:02:49.330> twisting<00:02:50.020> on<00:02:50.230> each<00:02:50.650> side<00:02:51.420> so

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
to do this twisting on each side so

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.900 
to do this twisting on each side so
breathe<00:02:52.750> out<00:02:53.020> as<00:02:53.380> you<00:02:53.560> turn<00:02:53.800> one<00:02:54.070> way<00:02:54.280> and<00:02:54.670> push

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:54.910 
breathe out as you turn one way and push

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:57.000 
breathe out as you turn one way and push
your<00:02:55.030> hands<00:02:55.300> apart<00:02:55.600> look<00:02:56.350> at<00:02:56.470> each<00:02:56.590> hand

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 
your hands apart look at each hand

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:00.020 
your hands apart look at each hand
breathe<00:02:57.850> in<00:02:58.150> draw<00:02:58.480> the<00:02:58.510> hands<00:02:58.870> back<00:02:59.140> together

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
breathe in draw the hands back together

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:05.570 
breathe in draw the hands back together
breathe<00:03:01.030> out<00:03:01.330> push<00:03:02.260> the<00:03:02.470> hands<00:03:02.770> apart<00:03:03.690> breathe

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:05.580 
breathe out push the hands apart breathe

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:09.240 
breathe out push the hands apart breathe
back<00:03:06.580> together<00:03:07.230> again<00:03:08.230> as<00:03:08.680> with<00:03:08.860> the<00:03:08.920> other

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250 
back together again as with the other

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:12.330 
back together again as with the other
exercises<00:03:10.290> you're<00:03:11.290> gonna<00:03:11.410> spend<00:03:11.770> a<00:03:11.950> fair<00:03:12.160> bit

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
exercises you're gonna spend a fair bit

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:13.920 
exercises you're gonna spend a fair bit
of<00:03:12.430> time<00:03:12.490> on<00:03:13.000> this<00:03:13.240> and<00:03:13.300> it's<00:03:13.630> well<00:03:13.900> worth

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:13.930 
of time on this and it's well worth

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:17.699 
of time on this and it's well worth
doing<00:03:14.440> that<00:03:15.840> practicing<00:03:16.840> slowly<00:03:17.200> to<00:03:17.440> begin

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:17.709 
doing that practicing slowly to begin

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:19.980 
doing that practicing slowly to begin
with<00:03:17.860> is<00:03:18.010> a<00:03:18.040> good<00:03:18.250> idea<00:03:18.430> but<00:03:19.420> you<00:03:19.540> can<00:03:19.720> also

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:19.990 
with is a good idea but you can also

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:22.560 
with is a good idea but you can also
experiment<00:03:20.980> with<00:03:21.280> doing<00:03:21.940> these<00:03:22.090> pushing

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:22.570 
experiment with doing these pushing

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:25.770 
experiment with doing these pushing
motions<00:03:23.020> quite<00:03:23.650> quickly<00:03:24.270> pressing<00:03:25.270> out<00:03:25.450> quite

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:37.209 
for the energy circulation you'll be

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:39.540 
for the energy circulation you'll be
doing<00:03:37.510> with<00:03:38.170> the<00:03:38.410> exercises<00:03:38.950> which<00:03:39.280> are<00:03:39.430> to
