00:00:00.039 --> 00:00:03.810
 we know details about all this now in this report as you 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.589
 they said I did next to the companions my son and Pedro belt we go 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:09.529
 go along 

00:00:09.529 --> 00:00:11.649
 subway of free to the population 

00:00:11.649 --> 00:00:17.189
 That's right, the savior subway will turn up. 

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:18.700
 that this be done 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:22.140
 this is wonderful the player must debut the Bahia people 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.599
 this approach 

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:25.269
 hahaha time 

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:29.489
 She tries to control, she hoped this is my heart. 

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:33.600
 It's hard to believe 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.590
 which the city hall promised next at the end of December these three days 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.690
 started to change and by the 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.330
 and the patella kneecap 

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:42.920
 but in the test phase 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.339
 will be the period to train staff 

00:00:45.339 --> 00:00:47.569
 fix possible crashes anyway 

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:48.910
 set everything 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:49.860
 will be 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.039
 six months of experiments 

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:53.830
 show with technicians 

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:57.890
 it is from July next year, yes, the population begins to be 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:00:59.000
 transported 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.370
 on good news this transport 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:03.470
 for free 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:06.970
 the city wants the population to get used to riding the subway 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:08.770
 and wait 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:10.789
 everybody find out soon 

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:13.840
 the importance of this means of transport to the city 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:18.329
 the presenter already has a partnership with the ministry of cities 

00:01:18.329 --> 00:01:23.099
 as it was done in the great Brazilian cities. 

00:01:23.099 --> 00:01:28.490
 January so that the first few months the dossier brings to the 

00:01:28.489 --> 00:01:32.840
 we have this partnership with the minister of the cities but for 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.820
 ride that carried 80,000 passengers for free per day 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:39.480
 first it is necessary to finish this work 

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:41.390
 to know what's missing 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:46.650
 how much with the shot was spent what will be the final cost of the project between the 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:49.960
 to the pirajá edil station where money can leave 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.590
 the city hall made a contract with the army for a work of 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:57.520
 consulting the requirement of the union's court of accounts 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.439
 this contract between the city and army was signed because in March 

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:05.920
 this year the report with the result of the inspection 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.080
 must reach the city hall this week before 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:10.229
 let's take a close look 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:14.510
 how is the subway and what the city hall has promised to one of the most 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.199
 controversy of the city 

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:20.189
 it's already been 12 years of work and the three do not walk 

00:02:20.189 --> 00:02:21.489
 the initial project 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:25.919
 previous of the 12 kilometers between the station of the already known lagoon of piraja 

00:02:26.429 --> 00:02:28.899
 but was halved 

00:02:28.899 --> 00:02:32.319
 on this trip we did the part of the lapa season we saw closely 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.090
 more details of the work that stubborn in not being ready 

00:02:36.859 --> 00:02:38.090
 in some points 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:41.540
 you can see other workers working to build the new source 

00:02:42.109 --> 00:02:43.809
 and we come to imagine 

00:02:43.809 --> 00:02:46.959
 will it be that the stadium will be two nights that the subway works 

00:02:47.919 --> 00:02:49.079
 we will follow 

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:50.679
 and a little further on 

00:02:50.679 --> 00:02:54.869
 we passed by the station sprouts we found the new wagon stopped 

00:02:55.639 --> 00:02:57.129
 another in the colorful 

00:02:57.129 --> 00:03:00.129
 appeared cleaned inside 

00:03:01.609 --> 00:03:04.399
 We're already on the tub in the body. 

00:03:04.399 --> 00:03:09.099
 and the original project of the subway has just been modified again the city hall 

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:12.589
 decided to build a passenger transhipment 

00:03:12.589 --> 00:03:17.189
 in this region here to benefit residents who are in the neighborhood of sprouts 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:22.640
 and that descend to compose the body dwellers question here in group b that 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:26.850
 heading to the cosme de farias neighborhood in total will benefit 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:31.420
 about him up to 100 thousand people suddenly I also interaction with the 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:33.229
 I almost hit the ground 

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:37.289
 will not open theft some other problems that we showed days ago already 

00:03:37.289 --> 00:03:38.629
 were resolved 

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:43.409
 the high voltage wires that pass over the rails are already a distance 

00:03:43.409 --> 00:03:44.389
 safe 

00:03:44.389 --> 00:03:47.999
 islands were made for the requests by engineers of the 

00:03:47.999 --> 00:03:49.669
 town hall 

00:03:49.669 --> 00:03:54.109
 after half an hour of travel and with two stops we complete with six 

00:03:54.109 --> 00:03:57.109
 kilometers and we reached the patella kneecap 

00:03:57.629 --> 00:04:00.430
 but the speed of the subway when it is circulating 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:01.899
 it will be much bigger 

00:04:01.899 --> 00:04:05.669
 and travel can be made in 15 minutes at most 

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:07.610
 we landed 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:11.340
 and we went to the operational control room of the three 

00:04:11.939 --> 00:04:16.329
 the facilities are ready and the technicians can already see 

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:21.120
 all the way through a TV circuit installed along the road 

00:04:21.719 --> 00:04:24.210
 But for now 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:27.659
 on the outside most problems one of them 

00:04:27.659 --> 00:04:29.419
 of greatest concern 

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:32.419
 the lack of integration with other means of transport 

00:04:33.099 --> 00:04:37.909
 but until July of next year the promise of the city hall is to transform this place 

00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:40.590
 in a large parking lot 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:44.290
 is well below the viaducts of the expressway Bay of All Saints 

00:04:45.189 --> 00:04:47.389
 who wants to go to the city center 

00:04:47.389 --> 00:04:51.930
 you can leave the car parked here and take the subway that is very close 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:54.690
 a pedestrian walkway 

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:56.000
 must be built 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.770
 to the subway station 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:00.770
 and from the outside look like this 

00:05:01.779 --> 00:05:03.409
 we took the landing 

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:05.900
 and we started with engineer francisco ulisses 

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:09.259
 the coordinator of the transportation projects of the city of salvador 

00:05:09.259 --> 00:05:11.280
 it says that the parameter is useful 

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:14.680
 integration with other modes of transport 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:16.650
 what will take time to happen 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:20.400
 in addition to expanding the road system through existing norms 

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:24.889
 duplication of existing roads and the solution of critical points of 

00:05:24.889 --> 00:05:25.759
 traffic 

00:05:25.759 --> 00:05:27.620
 We're going to create a network. 

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:28.800
 multimodal 

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:31.270
 I'm not listening to the suburban train. 

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:34.729
 involving the subway involving the brt system 

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:38.710
 all three systems they will be integrated 

00:05:39.819 --> 00:05:43.860
 will operate as an integrated network including transport 

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:44.740
 conventional 

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:47.380
 these works that are missing to complete the subway 

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:50.380
 integration with the buses will still take some time 

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:56.030
 perhaps also the time it takes for the population to believe that 

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:56.699
 the subway 

00:05:56.699 --> 00:05:58.180
 It will even work. 

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:01.410
 last night but it's worth remembering that now in the east 

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:04.000
 it's hard to be led by land 

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.599
 barack obama 

00:06:06.599 --> 00:06:12.259
 of life / in the cabula in the pirapa lapa will solve a lot but for this to do 

00:06:12.259 --> 00:06:15.479
 a new proof but the secretary of the civil house joão leão 

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:20.120
 speak with enthusiasm of the subway the edis do not have doubts 

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:25.910
 of which he will run in 2012 the first stretch the first batch of the subway 

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:29.290
 from the lapa season to the 

00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:30.690
 north access 

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:35.230
 he will vote he will run until December of that year running and 

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:39.550
 experience and by July of next year he will be voting with the 

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:43.070
 passenger is already a money forecast is for example cost of the tariff 

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:46.910
 that the subway kyphosis was being charged today, we did not have a 

00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:55.100
 The interconnection rate forecast would be to melt the bus and the 

00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:59.020
 subway that would be something around three floors we returned to 

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:03.130
 we also made the trip back to lapa 

00:07:03.639 --> 00:07:05.460
 We gave the traffic down there. 

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:08.469
 always complicated as it is complicated to predict safely 

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:12.509
 when the three will be running at full speed through these rails 

00:07:13.159 --> 00:07:17.699
 we will hope that we have already seen that at least there is a light in the 

00:07:17.699 --> 00:07:17.840
 tunnel
