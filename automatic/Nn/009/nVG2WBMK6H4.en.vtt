00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:05.069
 hello to everyone and welcome back today we see 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.649
 together a speed exercise that 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:08.910
 however it can also be used as 

00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:10.920
 fragment of musical phrase for the 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.309
 your improvisations or yours 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.309
 Arsoli 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.369
 I'll start by telling you this 

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:26.800
 exercise is based on the minor scale 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:29.770
 pentatonic beyond in first position e 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:31.810
 for those who didn't know what I'm talking about 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:33.399
 do not worry because I will post soon 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:36.370
 a video with the explanation of 

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:38.769
 this fateful pentatonic minor scale 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:40.659
 for this exercise we will use the 

00:00:38.769 --> 00:00:43.329
 so-called amiron which is one of the two 

00:00:40.659 --> 00:00:46.320
 movements of the delegated technique in what 

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:50.170
 consists of making a note 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:52.180
 normally given a picking and for 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:54.790
 perform the next note on it 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:56.650
 rope but in a more acute position be disco 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:58.360
 of the keys that are closer to yours 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:00.129
 right than the first note that 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:02.290
 we performed instead of giving one 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:04.239
 picking we press the button with force 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:06.280
 using only the finger of the hand 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:07.900
 left 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:11.140
 then we position ourselves with the index 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:12.820
 on the fourth string fifth key we will give 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:14.770
 the picking to do this note is 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:17.490
 as we have said that it is done for 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:20.220
 using the meron technique 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:23.110
 we are going to position ourselves with the ring finger 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.820
 pressing the seventh button on the 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:28.650
 same rope without giving another 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:28.650
 picking in this way 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:36.329
 we move to the third string with 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:36.329
 the index and we do the same thing 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:43.710
 back to the fourth and resume 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:43.710
 the exercise performing cyclically 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.549
 no 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:55.670
 as for the picking vi 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.050
 I recommend using the picking 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.240
 alternating for which on the fourth string 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:03.010
 ruined down and on the third 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.010
 pens through the top in this way 

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:15.260
 as usual I repeat you to start 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.150
 very low speed exercise e 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.310
 increase gradually only in 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:22.940
 moment when you see that exercise 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:26.290
 it comes naturally and above all 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:28.580
 clean without too many errors or dirt 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:31.340
