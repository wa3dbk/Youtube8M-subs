00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.600
 so we shoot a little video for 

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:08.280
 tender 

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:10.889
 for the company don-stroy invest 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.139
 and the length we took an apartment in the complex 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.210
 all game with which is located in 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.160
 building one on the twenty fifth floor and 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:21.180
 has the fifth type here this picture we 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:23.160
 took the site and from it we made here 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:27.180
 such a layout in our tool for 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:30.689
 creating then active apartments as seen 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:35.070
 if it comes close it is already furnished 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:36.600
 the furniture is not supposed to texture japan it 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.950
 all right in the browser and happens that is 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.079
 no installation required 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.899
 additional security and on it 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:47.910
 right here you can walk and watch 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:48.300
 me 3d format as the top and with the view 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.950
 out of sight 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.950
 let's try 3d 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:00.280
 here after under loading textures flat 

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:03.489
 looks like this can be 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:06.070
 look from different sides twist 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:09.119
 You can also superimpose a panorama to 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:13.320
 the view from the windows now we will probably see 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.320
 if you come to walk mode 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:25.690
 the user can walk 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:28.370
 view from the eyes to move around the apartment 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:29.990
 at the same time we see a large number 

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:35.150
 details of the interior view from the window which 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:37.310
 was attached to this wall layout 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:40.090
 decorated with all sorts of pictures on the table 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.090
 are apples 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:52.439
 can pay attention to enough 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:52.439
 high quality pictures in the browser 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:04.050
 reflection shadow setting light and so 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:06.920
 further actually from such a three-dimensional 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:08.850
 layouts after that we can do 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:11.100
 an interactive tool that can 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:13.069
 used both in browsers and by the way 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:16.280
 speaking of it can do 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:19.530
 photorealistic well or at least 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:22.050
 high-quality renders of pictures from 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.730
 the point where the person is where he is 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:26.610
 presses the render generation button 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:31.050
 and besides this here right from this 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:32.820
 planning that we have prepared for 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:37.250
 overall quite a short time 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:37.250
 you can do this 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.940
 just generated render 

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:53.050
 there are many other little things 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:55.480
 who can emotionally hook 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:57.370
 potential buyer of the apartment 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.020
 for example, there is a real clock 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:00.880
 of time 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:05.140
 if you put an apartment 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:07.330
 comments can be seen 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:10.960
 visible and reflections of fire and so on then 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:14.860
 there is a possibility of various special effects 

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:16.660
 Now we take for example and right in 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:21.070
 real time in bang put a stone 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:22.150
 that start to burn beautifully and in 

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:23.740
 Generally it will be possible 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:26.740
 such an opportunity to give anyone 

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:29.880
 to the user, so go on 

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:35.740
 from this very apartment we can make 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:38.260
 special special part of mobile 

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:40.500
 applications this is an interactive walk on 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:43.870
 iPads and iPhones since 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:47.550
 All this application is implemented on the engine 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:47.550
 on unity3d technology 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:52.420
 everything is easy apartment and tsya on 

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:54.550
 mobile device 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:56.230
 that is, if it were done 

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:58.930
 flash this opportunity and would not be 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:03.120
 Now we will show how this 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:03.120
 the way it looks for example the most 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:17.299
 this is the same apartment that is for sure 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:20.870
 can also be viewed from different angles 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:22.690
 so a person will be able to choose 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:27.560
 own training and 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:29.560
 consider her overall pretty close 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:36.910
 details then 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:38.080
 carpet or do not know the furniture except such 

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:42.010
 forms 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:46.150
 consideration there is also a walk 

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:46.150
 it works about the same as 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:50.980
 and on a big computer 

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:02.200
 so the check will be able to meet 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:04.030
 apartment in advance unfortunately we are not 

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:09.070
 managed to prepare and for for iphone but 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:10.570
 we have another apartment that was 

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:12.430
 prepared in advance as we see 

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:16.110
 here is very much the same way 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:18.370
 controls are all the same in essence 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:21.490
 a person can walk in the same way 

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:23.440
 in their future apartment enjoy 

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:28.890
 views from the window if they are captured 

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:28.890
 and mentally get ready for her purchase
