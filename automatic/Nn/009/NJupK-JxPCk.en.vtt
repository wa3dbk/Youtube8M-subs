of this video which will become apparent
very<00:00:14.730> soon<00:00:15.440> secondly<00:00:16.440> I<00:00:16.680> was<00:00:17.279> told<00:00:17.580> that<00:00:18.060> the

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
very soon secondly I was told that the

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.510

Alliance are seriously outnumbered by

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.750 
Alliance are seriously outnumbered by
the<00:00:20.580> Horde<00:00:20.939> on<00:00:21.119> the<00:00:21.210> PTR<00:00:21.570> ago<00:00:22.529> if<00:00:22.890> I<00:00:23.460> became

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
the Horde on the PTR ago if I became

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.609 
the Horde on the PTR ago if I became
remember<00:00:24.119> their<00:00:24.300> lines<00:00:24.510> again<00:00:24.930> and<00:00:25.140> joined

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
remember their lines again and joined

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.320 
remember their lines again and joined
the<00:00:25.740> battleground<00:00:26.609> queue<00:00:26.939> for<00:00:27.150> the<00:00:27.210> new

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
the battleground queue for the new

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.240 
the battleground queue for the new
battleground<00:00:27.810> which<00:00:28.320> is<00:00:28.560> deep<00:00:28.800> wing<00:00:28.980> gorge

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
battleground which is deep wing gorge

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.450 
battleground which is deep wing gorge
then<00:00:30.119> the<00:00:30.420> q<00:00:30.689> should<00:00:31.080> pop<00:00:31.380> a<00:00:31.679> lot<00:00:32.219> quicker

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
then the q should pop a lot quicker

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.370 
then the q should pop a lot quicker
because<00:00:32.880> so<00:00:33.239> far<00:00:33.480> have<00:00:33.630> racked<00:00:33.899> up<00:00:34.079> around

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
because so far have racked up around

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.340 
because so far have racked up around
seven<00:00:34.950> hours<00:00:35.280> of<00:00:35.460> queueing<00:00:36.329> time<00:00:36.600> with<00:00:36.840> no<00:00:37.050> pop

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
seven hours of queueing time with no pop

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.630 
seven hours of queueing time with no pop
but<00:00:38.040> look<00:00:38.190> at<00:00:38.309> this<00:00:38.840> 11<00:00:39.840> minutes<00:00:40.110> on<00:00:40.260> average

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:40.640

you do use the teleportation device it's

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.870 
you do use the teleportation device it's
a<00:01:41.880> one-way<00:01:42.780> trip<00:01:43.409> make<00:01:43.710> sure<00:01:43.740> that<00:01:44.520> you've<00:01:44.670> got

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880
