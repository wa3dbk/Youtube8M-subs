00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
about 15 seconds I'm going to fish it

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.490 
about 15 seconds I'm going to fish it
out<00:01:08.850> and<00:01:09.299> I'm<00:01:09.720> going<00:01:09.840> to<00:01:09.869> put<00:01:10.020> into<00:01:10.140> the<00:01:10.290> cold

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.100 
out and I'm going to put into the cold
water<00:01:10.710> so<00:01:10.890> it's<00:01:11.159> pretty<00:01:11.369> hot<00:01:11.610> to<00:01:11.760> handle<00:01:12.150> now

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
water so it's pretty hot to handle now

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.289 
water so it's pretty hot to handle now
you<00:01:13.260> can<00:01:13.409> see<00:01:13.619> that<00:01:13.890> the<00:01:14.040> skin<00:01:14.310> on<00:01:15.000> the<00:01:15.060> bottom

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
you can see that the skin on the bottom

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.530 
you can see that the skin on the bottom
here<00:01:15.720> it's<00:01:16.200> nice<00:01:16.350> and<00:01:16.590> loose<00:01:16.740> and<00:01:17.360> also<00:01:18.360> at<00:01:18.450> the

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
here it's nice and loose and also at the

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.450 
here it's nice and loose and also at the
top<00:01:18.780> my<00:01:19.200> skin<00:01:19.439> seems<00:01:19.680> to<00:01:19.770> split<00:01:20.100> at<00:01:20.189> the<00:01:20.280> top

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
top my skin seems to split at the top

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:21.770 
top my skin seems to split at the top
that's<00:01:20.670> absolutely<00:01:21.060> fine<00:01:21.270> if<00:01:21.420> that<00:01:21.540> happens

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
that's absolutely fine if that happens

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.320 
that's absolutely fine if that happens
to<00:01:21.960> you<00:01:22.080> as<00:01:22.170> well<00:01:22.729> makes<00:01:23.729> it<00:01:23.850> easier<00:01:24.119> to<00:01:24.210> peel

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330

to you as well makes it easier to peel
the<00:01:24.450> skin<00:01:24.570> away<00:01:24.840> so<00:01:25.170> just<00:01:25.200> pop<00:01:25.740> your

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890

and<00:01:29.900> move<00:01:30.900> it<00:01:31.200> in<00:01:31.650> this<00:01:31.860> larger<00:01:32.790> pieces<00:01:33.119> as<00:01:33.270> you

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299

can

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:38.690 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:40.540
