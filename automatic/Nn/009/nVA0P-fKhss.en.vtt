Sidel Saxony chromatic harmonica
this<00:00:19.150> is<00:00:19.300> a<00:00:19.330> 12<00:00:19.660> hole<00:00:19.900> harmonica<00:00:20.680> made<00:00:20.920> in

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:21.220 
this is a 12 hole harmonica made in

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:25.950 
this is a 12 hole harmonica made in
Germany<00:00:22.320> by<00:00:23.320> hand<00:00:23.650> and<00:00:23.920> I<00:00:24.700> tested<00:00:24.939> it<00:00:25.240> some

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:25.960 
Germany by hand and I tested it some

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:27.030 
Germany by hand and I tested it some
time<00:00:26.170> ago<00:00:26.200> and<00:00:26.470> I've<00:00:26.590> been<00:00:26.619> using<00:00:26.860> it

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:27.040 
time ago and I've been using it

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:29.190 
time ago and I've been using it
exclusively<00:00:27.700> since<00:00:28.029> then<00:00:28.270> like<00:00:28.869> to<00:00:28.990> show<00:00:29.140> you

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:29.200 
exclusively since then like to show you

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.410 
exclusively since then like to show you
why<00:00:29.439> this<00:00:29.500> harmonic<00:00:30.070> appeals<00:00:30.430> to<00:00:30.610> me<00:00:30.730> the

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:31.420 
why this harmonic appeals to me the

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:32.850 
why this harmonic appeals to me the
first<00:00:31.660> thing<00:00:31.780> I<00:00:31.869> look<00:00:32.050> for<00:00:32.110> in<00:00:32.470> a<00:00:32.559> chromatic

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:32.860 
first thing I look for in a chromatic

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:35.010 
first thing I look for in a chromatic
harmonica<00:00:33.100> is<00:00:33.640> that<00:00:33.820> it<00:00:33.910> has<00:00:34.059> even<00:00:34.360> response

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:35.020 
harmonica is that it has even response

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:37.290 
harmonica is that it has even response
and<00:00:35.290> the<00:00:35.890> way<00:00:36.010> I<00:00:36.040> test<00:00:36.400> that<00:00:36.489> is<00:00:36.730> with<00:00:36.910> minimal

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:37.300 
and the way I test that is with minimal

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.840 
and the way I test that is with minimal
volume<00:00:37.720> making<00:00:38.440> sure<00:00:38.590> every<00:00:38.860> reed<00:00:39.129> responds

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:39.850 
volume making sure every reed responds

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:51.870 
volume making sure every reed responds
the<00:00:39.940> same<00:00:49.680> and<00:00:50.680> I<00:00:50.800> get<00:00:50.950> an<00:00:51.040> even<00:00:51.250> response<00:00:51.670> all

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:51.880 
the same and I get an even response all

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:54.150 
the same and I get an even response all
the<00:00:52.030> way<00:00:52.120> through<00:00:52.559> second<00:00:53.559> thing<00:00:53.680> I<00:00:53.770> look<00:00:53.920> for

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:54.160 
the way through second thing I look for

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.420 
the way through second thing I look for
is<00:00:54.280> the<00:00:54.399> ability<00:00:54.460> to<00:00:55.260> play<00:00:56.260> an<00:00:56.530> even<00:00:56.800> scale

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:57.430 
is the ability to play an even scale

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:59.340 
is the ability to play an even scale
that<00:00:57.730> means<00:00:57.969> every<00:00:58.270> reed<00:00:58.480> has<00:00:58.690> the<00:00:58.840> same<00:00:59.079> tone

00:00:59.340 --> 00:00:59.350 
that means every reed has the same tone

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:02.700 
that means every reed has the same tone
the<00:01:00.040> slide<00:01:00.340> is<00:01:01.079> transparent<00:01:02.079> does<00:01:02.230> not<00:01:02.410> get<00:01:02.590> in

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:02.710 
the slide is transparent does not get in

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:05.700 
the slide is transparent does not get in
my<00:01:02.739> way<00:01:02.890> and<00:01:03.270> the<00:01:04.270> valves<00:01:04.809> or<00:01:04.989> the<00:01:05.110> windsavers

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:05.710 
my way and the valves or the windsavers

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:07.590 
my way and the valves or the windsavers
do<00:01:05.860> not<00:01:06.009> make<00:01:06.190> any<00:01:06.399> distortion<00:01:07.270> or<00:01:07.450> any

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:07.600 
do not make any distortion or any

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.690 
do not make any distortion or any
clicking<00:01:07.990> or<00:01:08.200> popping<00:01:08.649> so<00:01:09.100> that<00:01:09.220> I<00:01:09.250> can<00:01:09.490> play

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:09.700 
clicking or popping so that I can play

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.460 
clicking or popping so that I can play
essentially<00:01:10.149> like<00:01:10.300> on<00:01:10.479> the<00:01:10.570> piano<00:01:10.899> just<00:01:11.050> float

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:11.470 
essentially like on the piano just float

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:23.940 
essentially like on the piano just float
up<00:01:11.500> and<00:01:11.740> down

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:23.950 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:26.230 

everything<00:01:24.950> should<00:01:25.100> sound<00:01:25.430> and<00:01:25.729> feel<00:01:26.030> the

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:26.240 
everything should sound and feel the

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.730 
everything should sound and feel the
same<00:01:26.479> and<00:01:26.780> to<00:01:26.900> me<00:01:27.080> it<00:01:27.320> does<00:01:28.450> lastly<00:01:29.450> I<00:01:29.930> need<00:01:30.470> to

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:30.740 
same and to me it does lastly I need to

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.639 
same and to me it does lastly I need to
be<00:01:30.950> able<00:01:31.040> to<00:01:31.220> color<00:01:31.460> the<00:01:31.790> sound<00:01:32.170> in<00:01:33.170> an

00:01:33.639 --> 00:01:33.649 
be able to color the sound in an

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:36.219 
be able to color the sound in an
artistic<00:01:34.009> way<00:01:34.250> that<00:01:35.060> means<00:01:35.270> I<00:01:35.360> use<00:01:35.390> volume<00:01:35.869> and

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:36.229 
artistic way that means I use volume and

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:40.960 
artistic way that means I use volume and
tone<00:01:36.649> changes<00:01:37.420> tremolo<00:01:38.420> vibrato<00:01:39.200> and<00:01:39.970> chorus

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:40.970
