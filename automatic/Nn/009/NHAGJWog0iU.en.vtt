a printed on graphic I believe in red
it's<00:00:26.519> actually<00:00:26.699> a<00:00:26.939> deeper<00:00:27.390> red<00:00:27.599> then<00:00:27.869> it's

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
it's actually a deeper red then it's

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:33.290

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:36.570 
are like delayed by double so yeah you

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:38.480 
are like delayed by double so yeah you
would<00:04:36.720> usually<00:04:36.870> like<00:04:37.200> take<00:04:37.950> three<00:04:38.250> or<00:04:38.310> five

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:38.490 
would usually like take three or five

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:42.529 
would usually like take three or five
days<00:04:38.729> but<00:04:39.090> it's<00:04:39.270> not<00:04:39.450> really<00:04:39.600> a<00:04:39.720> problem<00:04:41.539> so

00:04:42.529 --> 00:04:42.539
