00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920
 hello everyone nikolai with you today 

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:07.859
 continuation of my project 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:10.530
 history of the world of warcraft and 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:10.889
 In this issue, I will tell you about the Western 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.950
 edge 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:16.529
 well then let's start the western edge 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:19.910
 is the borders kingdom stormgrad and 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:22.650
 enough populated locations 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:26.310
 this region is under control 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:28.560
 Alliance used to be big here 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.279
 number of farmers but that all 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:34.170
 decay came during the second war 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:37.350
 the western edge was filled with bandits from 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.840
 justice fraternity stormgrad 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.610
 considers this land his property 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.500
 but the kingdom does not have enough money 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.629
 to establish in these lands full 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.100
 the order 

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:48.480
 a handful of farmers still tried 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.700
 restore your possessions 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.920
 and some even traded with assault 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.770
 hail but most of the harvest was enough 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.260
 just to feed yourself 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:01:01.670
 bandits and gnolls steal supplies regularly 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.840
 harvest farmers fraternity of justice 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:04.290
 controls most of the western 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.780
 the edges 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:10.140
 but the main forces are concentrated in the moon 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:12.420
 speech when some territories of azerot 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.729
 captured the arches of the dead and demons 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:18.960
 the western edge fell from their own people 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:21.090
 shortly after the Second War, the brotherhood 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:24.119
 justice led by edwin van 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:26.250
 Cliff tries to capture them Stormwind 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:29.600
 chose the western edge as their 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:32.220
 bases where they planned their operations 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.210
 farmers have not had time to recover from 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.860
 horde attacks 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.740
 failed to provide decent 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.540
 resistance to gangsters soon 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.509
 most westerners 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:46.079
 left their cities and farms and on their 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:48.329
 the place came gangsters rulers in 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:50.549
 stormgrades consider other problems more 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:52.439
 priority rather than some kind of fraternity 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:54.240
 they believe that someday they 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:56.520
 get to the western edge 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.560
 they probably don't even realize the true 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.439
 the threat that comes right on their 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.369
 territories fighting fraternity 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:04.979
 of justice 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:07.170
 continues after the cataclysm but already 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:10.009
 not so tense because the main force 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:12.300
 managing fraternity managed to execute 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:14.130
 stormgrad now sends much 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.620
 more troops on these lands 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:19.080
 However, to replace the previous leader Edwin 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.300
 Van Cleef was his successor exactly 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:24.780
 which promised to crack down on any 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:27.000
 who is to blame for the death of her father and now 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.580
 let's take a little geography 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.830
 western edge 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:33.450
 once proud land of farmers and shepherds 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:35.640
 now completely in decline 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:39.600
 mainly because of the thieves who 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:41.730
 usurped this land now on this 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.510
 rich land grow mostly only 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:46.260
 weeds 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:49.170
 the wind blows empty fields sometime 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:53.580
 blooming area slowly turns into 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:56.250
 desert land of dried up black soil 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:59.070
 turns into sand of golden color 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:02.040
 a strong wind drives a tumbleweed 

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:03.239
 this area now looks like a prairie they 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.810
 Azeroth's breadbasket 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:09.209
 what she used to be most of 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:11.790
 western edge remains unchanged in 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:13.950
 as a result of the cataclysm part of the farm and 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.609
 access to the coast captured a huge 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:18.690
 landslide 

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:21.000
 over which the large funnel rotates on 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:23.880
 this story of the western edge came to 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.819
 the end with you was i nicula of everything 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:29.600

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:29.600
