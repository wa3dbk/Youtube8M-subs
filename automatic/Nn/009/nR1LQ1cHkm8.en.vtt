00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
does now it's it's wrong it's it

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.709 
does now it's it's wrong it's it
shouldn't<00:00:39.840> be<00:00:39.989> like<00:00:40.200> that<00:00:40.260> and<00:00:40.800> I'm<00:00:41.719> getting

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
shouldn't be like that and I'm getting

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.080 
shouldn't be like that and I'm getting
absolutely<00:00:43.020> slaughtered<00:00:43.440> here<00:00:43.770> because<00:00:44.489> the

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
absolutely slaughtered here because the

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.110 
absolutely slaughtered here because the
team<00:00:45.329> is<00:00:45.360> using<00:00:45.980> DMR's<00:00:46.980> against<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:47.820> battle

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
team is using DMR's against the battle

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.930 
team is using DMR's against the battle
rifle<00:00:48.450> now<00:00:49.170> if<00:00:49.559> they<00:00:49.829> have<00:00:50.070> if<00:00:50.309> they<00:00:50.370> give<00:00:50.910> a

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
rifle now if they have if they give a

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.450 
rifle now if they have if they give a
buff<00:00:51.329> to<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:51.719> battle<00:00:52.020> rifle<00:00:52.379> and<00:00:52.590> make<00:00:53.010> it<00:00:53.250> a

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
buff to the battle rifle and make it a

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.720 
buff to the battle rifle and make it a
bit<00:00:54.270> stronger<00:00:54.809> because<00:00:55.199> at<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:56.250> moment<00:00:56.280> it<00:00:56.670> is

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
bit stronger because at the moment it is

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.479 
bit stronger because at the moment it is
fairly<00:00:57.629> weak<00:00:58.050> it<00:00:58.260> does<00:00:58.410> take<00:00:58.680> quite<00:00:58.890> a<00:00:59.039> bit<00:00:59.280> to

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
fairly weak it does take quite a bit to

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.849 
fairly weak it does take quite a bit to
kill<00:00:59.670> someone<00:01:00.090> so<00:01:00.480> I<00:01:00.510> think<00:01:00.780> maybe<00:01:01.109> if<00:01:01.680> they

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
kill someone so I think maybe if they

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.380 
kill someone so I think maybe if they
did<00:01:02.129> give<00:01:02.309> it<00:01:02.340> a<00:01:02.460> bit<00:01:02.609> of<00:01:02.640> a<00:01:02.789> buff<00:01:03.000> that<00:01:03.239> would

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
did give it a bit of a buff that would

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.770 
did give it a bit of a buff that would
be<00:01:03.539> nice<00:01:03.719> but<00:01:04.080> just<00:01:04.949> in<00:01:05.100> general<00:01:05.450> it's<00:01:06.450> just

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
be nice but just in general it's just

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.640 
be nice but just in general it's just
not<00:01:07.439> seeming<00:01:07.979> like<00:01:08.540> the<00:01:09.540> DMR<00:01:09.960> is<00:01:10.200> just<00:01:10.470> a

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
not seeming like the DMR is just a

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.940 
not seeming like the DMR is just a
weapon<00:01:11.040> that<00:01:11.070> really<00:01:12.049> is<00:01:13.049> it's<00:01:13.619> way<00:01:13.890> too

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
weapon that really is it's way too

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.330 
weapon that really is it's way too
overpowered<00:01:14.880> and<00:01:15.030> it<00:01:15.330> needs<00:01:15.689> to<00:01:16.080> be<00:01:16.340> patched

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
overpowered and it needs to be patched

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.740 
overpowered and it needs to be patched
or<00:01:17.759> fixed<00:01:18.360> because<00:01:18.830> yet<00:01:19.830> it's<00:01:20.400> been<00:01:20.700> so<00:01:21.509> it's

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750

have<00:02:04.920> to<00:02:05.040> make<00:02:05.189> a<00:02:05.250> short<00:02:05.790> clip<00:02:06.240> on<00:02:06.509> the<00:02:07.409> actual

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
have to make a short clip on the actual

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.770 
have to make a short clip on the actual
damage<00:02:08.069> that<00:02:08.280> it<00:02:08.399> does<00:02:08.899> because

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:10.780 
damage that it does because

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.430 
damage that it does because
a battle<00:02:11.200> rifle<00:02:11.740> at<00:02:12.010> the<00:02:12.160> moment<00:02:12.580> I<00:02:13.200> think<00:02:14.200> is

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
a battle rifle at the moment I think is

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.980 
a battle rifle at the moment I think is
I<00:02:14.800> don't<00:02:15.130> know<00:02:15.310> how<00:02:15.610> many<00:02:15.640> births<00:02:16.209> it<00:02:16.510> is<00:02:16.690> but

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:16.990 
I don't know how many births it is but

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:19.740 
I don't know how many births it is but
it<00:02:17.170> definitely<00:02:17.470> it<00:02:18.310> definitely<00:02:18.850> takes<00:02:19.270> a<00:02:19.480> lot

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
it definitely it definitely takes a lot

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:22.230 
it definitely it definitely takes a lot
more<00:02:19.780> than<00:02:20.170> the<00:02:20.290> demo<00:02:20.680> and<00:02:20.920> the<00:02:21.069> DMR<00:02:21.580> should

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:22.240 
more than the demo and the DMR should

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:24.870 
more than the demo and the DMR should
not<00:02:22.569> be<00:02:22.780> that<00:02:22.959> powerful<00:02:23.380> for<00:02:23.860> a<00:02:24.069> weapon<00:02:24.730> that's

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
not be that powerful for a weapon that's

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.449 
not be that powerful for a weapon that's
not<00:02:25.209> a<00:02:25.240> power<00:02:25.540> weapon<00:02:26.050> it's<00:02:26.770> basically<00:02:27.160> like<00:02:27.400> a

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:27.459 
not a power weapon it's basically like a

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:31.590 
not a power weapon it's basically like a
mini<00:02:27.760> sniper<00:02:28.090> rifle<00:02:28.660> that<00:02:28.900> is<00:02:29.170> I<00:02:30.510> don't<00:02:31.510> know

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:31.600 
mini sniper rifle that is I don't know

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.080 
mini sniper rifle that is I don't know
it<00:02:31.870> takes<00:02:32.080> three<00:02:32.650> head<00:02:32.860> shots<00:02:32.890> to<00:02:33.370> kill<00:02:33.550> which

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
it takes three head shots to kill which

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:38.690 
it takes three head shots to kill which
is<00:02:34.330> quite<00:02:35.489> quite<00:02:36.489> overpowered<00:02:37.239> versus<00:02:37.690> like

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
is quite quite overpowered versus like

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.820 
is quite quite overpowered versus like

the DMR because over it's over it's

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.440 
the DMR because over it's over it's
extreme<00:03:11.560> range<00:03:11.920> it<00:03:12.190> is<00:03:12.220> still<00:03:12.670> one<00:03:13.180> of<00:03:13.209> the

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:13.450 
extreme range it is still one of the

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:16.560 
extreme range it is still one of the
most<00:03:13.480> accurate<00:03:14.019> guns<00:03:14.890> in<00:03:15.190> the<00:03:15.430> game<00:03:15.670> which<00:03:16.269> it

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:16.570 
most accurate guns in the game which it

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:19.740 
most accurate guns in the game which it
should<00:03:16.989> not<00:03:17.380> be<00:03:17.579> it<00:03:18.579> should<00:03:18.880> not<00:03:19.090> be<00:03:19.150> like<00:03:19.480> that

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750 
should not be it should not be like that

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:22.860 
should not be it should not be like that
the<00:03:20.709> battle<00:03:21.070> rifle<00:03:21.519> they<00:03:22.299> should<00:03:22.540> have<00:03:22.570> kept

the battle rifle they should have kept

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:24.539 
the battle rifle they should have kept
the<00:03:22.930> old<00:03:23.049> start<00:03:23.470> they'll<00:03:23.769> doing<00:03:24.040> so<00:03:24.340> much

00:03:24.539 --> 00:03:24.549 
the old start they'll doing so much

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:30.300 
the old start they'll doing so much
nicer<00:03:26.970> but<00:03:27.970> now<00:03:28.150> I<00:03:28.180> greater<00:03:28.959> with<00:03:29.200> this<00:03:29.410> hugely

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310 
nicer but now I greater with this hugely

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:35.060 
nicer but now I greater with this hugely
underpowered<00:03:30.910> butter<00:03:31.660> rifle<00:03:32.170> which<00:03:33.510> it's

it's not the battle rifle is not
extremely<00:03:39.150> underpowered<00:03:40.150> but<00:03:40.570> versus<00:03:41.320> a<00:03:41.350> DMR

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:41.829 
extremely underpowered but versus a DMR

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:46.259 
extremely underpowered but versus a DMR
it<00:03:42.100> it<00:03:42.400> definitely<00:03:42.820> loses<00:03:43.600> its<00:03:44.579> ability<00:03:45.579> I

00:03:46.259 --> 00:03:46.269 
it it definitely loses its ability I

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:50.099

00:04:05.039 --> 00:04:05.049 
good which is yeah the demo just it

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:07.830 
good which is yeah the demo just it
shouldn't<00:04:05.500> be<00:04:05.620> like<00:04:05.829> that<00:04:05.890> i<00:04:06.130> hate<00:04:06.730> the<00:04:07.420> DMR

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:10.930 
I've hated it since reach I wanted them

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:13.080 
I've hated it since reach I wanted them
to<00:04:11.140> bring<00:04:11.290> the<00:04:11.470> battle<00:04:11.769> rifle<00:04:12.160> NM<00:04:12.549> reach<00:04:12.790> but

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:13.090 
to bring the battle rifle NM reach but

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:15.210 
to bring the battle rifle NM reach but
they<00:04:13.209> didn't<00:04:13.810> they<00:04:13.930> made<00:04:14.140> another<00:04:14.950> weapon

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:15.220

they didn't they made another weapon
that<00:04:15.700> just<00:04:16.269> I<00:04:16.539> didn't<00:04:17.289> think<00:04:17.530> was<00:04:17.769> as<00:04:17.919> good<00:04:19.019> so

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:20.239 
that just I didn't think was as good so

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:24.189 
that just I didn't think was as good so
so<00:04:21.109> yeah<00:04:21.380> I<00:04:22.060> brought<00:04:23.060> the<00:04:23.210> DMR<00:04:23.569> back<00:04:23.780> so<00:04:24.050> on

personal opinion was everyone's going to
pick<00:04:53.300> up<00:04:53.449> the<00:04:53.569> battle<00:04:53.900> rifle<00:04:54.289> and<00:04:54.500> just<00:04:54.710> go
