00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:51.170 
really afraid for saying this but um

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:54.730 
really afraid for saying this but um
she's<00:01:51.560> kind<00:01:52.280> of<00:01:52.310> that<00:01:52.490> one<00:01:52.670> friend<00:01:52.880> you<00:01:53.210> know

and I mean so I guess it doesn't really

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:58.469 
and I mean so I guess it doesn't really
make<00:01:56.450> sense<00:01:56.509> to<00:01:56.930> accept<00:01:57.259> like<00:01:57.439> a<00:01:57.470> blind<00:01:58.070> date

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:58.479 
make sense to accept like a blind date

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:00.880 
make sense to accept like a blind date
