over every knotted section of tool like

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:05.119 
over every knotted section of tool like
this<00:01:02.840> so<00:01:03.840> now<00:01:03.960> this<00:01:04.170> part<00:01:04.470> here<00:01:04.710> you're<00:01:04.949> going

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
this so now this part here you're going

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:06.859 
this so now this part here you're going
to<00:01:05.280> be<00:01:05.369> working<00:01:05.580> on<00:01:05.880> later<00:01:06.240> so<00:01:06.570> it<00:01:06.659> doesn't

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
to be working on later so it doesn't

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.050 
to be working on later so it doesn't
really<00:01:06.960> matter<00:01:07.140> if<00:01:07.740> it's<00:01:08.100> totally<00:01:08.430> secure<00:01:08.850> so

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
really matter if it's totally secure so

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.190 
really matter if it's totally secure so
i<00:01:09.119> take<00:01:10.939> this<00:01:11.939> is<00:01:12.150> probably<00:01:12.420> not<00:01:12.600> the<00:01:12.689> best<00:01:12.810> to

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
i take this is probably not the best to

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.740 
i take this is probably not the best to
to<00:01:13.380> to<00:01:13.619> show<00:01:13.860> on<00:01:14.010> because<00:01:14.280> it's<00:01:14.430> so<00:01:14.610> big<00:01:14.850> this

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
to to show on because it's so big this

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.560 
to to show on because it's so big this
is<00:01:15.960> my<00:01:16.170> prima<00:01:16.950> 22<00:01:17.310> which<00:01:17.520> is<00:01:17.670> 18<00:01:18.119> inches<00:01:18.299> in

more hair so I take it I grab the next
section<00:02:04.350> that<00:02:04.560> doesn't<00:02:05.070> have<00:02:05.280> any<00:02:06.090> ribbon

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
section that doesn't have any ribbon

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.630

over it

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.740 
over it
and<00:02:08.729> I<00:02:08.850> flatten<00:02:09.539> the<00:02:09.750> ribbon<00:02:10.020> out<00:02:10.170> as<00:02:10.319> I<00:02:10.470> go<00:02:11.750> and

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
and I flatten the ribbon out as I go and

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.230 
and I flatten the ribbon out as I go and
then<00:02:12.900> I<00:02:12.990> tuck<00:02:13.260> it<00:02:13.380> underneath<00:02:13.730> and<00:02:14.730> bring<00:02:15.090> it

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
then I tuck it underneath and bring it

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:22.280 
then I tuck it underneath and bring it
through<00:02:18.800> I'll<00:02:19.800> do<00:02:19.980> one<00:02:20.190> more<00:02:21.170> holding<00:02:22.170> the

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
through I'll do one more holding the

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.580 
through I'll do one more holding the
ribbon<00:02:22.590> so<00:02:22.920> the<00:02:23.520> rough<00:02:23.819> edge<00:02:24.150> is<00:02:24.510> going<00:02:25.410> to<00:02:25.470> be

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
ribbon so the rough edge is going to be

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.190 
ribbon so the rough edge is going to be

single face satin ribbon up I always

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:50.180 
single face satin ribbon up I always
time<00:03:47.640> I<00:03:47.850> half<00:03:48.060> not<00:03:48.360> this<00:03:49.050> just<00:03:49.320> helps<00:03:49.650> it<00:03:49.950> so

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190 
time I half not this just helps it so

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:52.730 
time I half not this just helps it so
the<00:03:50.310> ribbon<00:03:50.610> doesn't<00:03:50.940> pull<00:03:51.330> through<00:03:51.360> and<00:03:52.170> make

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:52.740 
the ribbon doesn't pull through and make

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:54.650 
the ribbon doesn't pull through and make
it<00:03:52.920> difficult<00:03:53.130> for<00:03:53.520> me<00:03:53.880> when<00:03:54.030> I'm<00:03:54.180> trying<00:03:54.480> to
