00:04:34.949 --> 00:04:38.170 
review on this as fashion luxe Barbie
doll<00:04:35.130> um<00:04:35.580> I<00:04:35.940> think<00:04:36.450> they're<00:04:36.720> really<00:04:36.990> cool<00:04:37.229> and

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:38.180 
doll um I think they're really cool and

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:40.339 
doll um I think they're really cool and
the<00:04:39.180> only<00:04:39.450> negative<00:04:39.810> thing<00:04:39.840> is<00:04:40.080> that<00:04:40.229> she

00:04:40.339 --> 00:04:40.349 
the only negative thing is that she

00:04:40.349 --> 00:04:42.409 
the only negative thing is that she
doesn't<00:04:40.590> come<00:04:40.889> with<00:04:41.010> a<00:04:41.130> stand<00:04:41.400> but<00:04:41.820> I<00:04:42.120> think

00:04:42.409 --> 00:04:42.419 
doesn't come with a stand but I think

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:44.990 
doesn't come with a stand but I think
that<00:04:42.690> the<00:04:42.930> fact<00:04:43.139> that<00:04:43.260> she's<00:04:43.500> so<00:04:43.680> poseable<00:04:44.220> is

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:45.000 
that the fact that she's so poseable is

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.290 
that the fact that she's so poseable is
a<00:04:45.090> giant<00:04:45.720> giant<00:04:46.110> cluster<00:04:46.650> party<00:04:47.039> line<00:04:47.190> um<00:04:47.729> and
