to D sonar you can buy this unit this

00:00:32.699 --> 00:00:35.840 
to D sonar you can buy this unit this
unit<00:00:33.030> runs<00:00:33.239> for<00:00:33.449> 399<00:00:34.079> okay<00:00:35.040> you<00:00:35.100> can<00:00:35.430> jump<00:00:35.670> up

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
unit runs for 399 okay you can jump up

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.150 
unit runs for 399 okay you can jump up
to<00:00:35.880> the<00:00:36.060> next<00:00:36.270> model<00:00:36.690> the<00:00:37.470> next<00:00:37.770> model<00:00:38.100> is

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
to the next model the next model is

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.220 
to the next model the next model is
going<00:00:38.280> to<00:00:38.340> be<00:00:38.400> the<00:00:38.460> helix<00:00:38.820> seven<00:00:39.210> down<00:00:39.750> image

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
going to be the helix seven down image

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.920 
going to be the helix seven down image
okay<00:00:41.220> with<00:00:41.430> the<00:00:41.550> downed<00:00:41.760> image<00:00:42.060> you<00:00:42.210> get<00:00:42.360> to<00:00:42.720> D

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
okay with the downed image you get to D

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.069 
okay with the downed image you get to D
and<00:00:43.280> down<00:00:44.280> image<00:00:44.610> on<00:00:44.760> this<00:00:44.880> one<00:00:45.120> unit<00:00:45.540> the

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
and down image on this one unit the

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.410 
and down image on this one unit the
price<00:00:46.320> will<00:00:46.530> go<00:00:46.560> up<00:00:46.710> just<00:00:46.980> a<00:00:47.070> little<00:00:47.220> bit<00:00:47.420> and

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
price will go up just a little bit and

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.200 
price will go up just a little bit and
again<00:00:48.720> if<00:00:49.200> you<00:00:49.470> want<00:00:49.680> something<00:00:49.920> more<00:00:50.070> you<00:00:51.059> go

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
again if you want something more you go

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.450 
again if you want something more you go
up<00:00:51.300> to<00:00:51.390> the<00:00:51.480> next<00:00:51.780> one<00:00:52.020> this<00:00:52.260> is<00:00:52.410> a<00:00:52.440> helix<00:00:52.950> seven

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
up to the next one this is a helix seven

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.870 
up to the next one this is a helix seven
sonar<00:00:54.450> when<00:00:54.809> you<00:00:54.960> get<00:00:55.110> the<00:00:55.260> sonar<00:00:55.500> you<00:00:56.430> get<00:00:56.700> the

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:56.880 
sonar when you get the sonar you get the

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:58.490 
sonar when you get the sonar you get the
previous<00:00:57.300> two<00:00:57.480> models<00:00:57.870> in<00:00:58.020> there<00:00:58.170> as<00:00:58.230> well<00:00:58.260> so

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
previous two models in there as well so

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.290 
previous two models in there as well so
with<00:00:59.010> the<00:00:59.130> sonar<00:00:59.489> unit<00:00:59.730> I<00:01:00.059> get<00:01:00.950> to<00:01:01.950> D<00:01:02.160> and<00:01:02.460> down

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
with the sonar unit I get to D and down

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.440 
with the sonar unit I get to D and down
image<00:01:03.660> and<00:01:04.040> GPS<00:01:05.040> in<00:01:05.309> this<00:01:05.880> sonar<00:01:06.240> and<00:01:06.390> the

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
image and GPS in this sonar and the

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.980 
image and GPS in this sonar and the
helix<00:01:06.749> seven<00:01:07.079> ok<00:01:07.259> so<00:01:07.319> now<00:01:07.649> if<00:01:08.490> you<00:01:08.819> want<00:01:09.090> all

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
helix seven ok so now if you want all

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.779 
helix seven ok so now if you want all
three<00:01:10.319> of<00:01:10.409> these<00:01:10.649> then<00:01:11.039> you<00:01:11.159> get<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.520> the

00:01:11.779 --> 00:01:11.789 
three of these then you get the the

00:01:11.789 --> 00:01:17.690 
three of these then you get the the
helix<00:01:12.889> 7d<00:01:13.889> I<00:01:13.920> with<00:01:14.759> GPS<00:01:15.299> here<00:01:15.749> now<00:01:16.409> we<00:01:17.399> get<00:01:17.579> up

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
helix 7d I with GPS here now we get up

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.349 
helix 7d I with GPS here now we get up
to<00:01:17.819> the<00:01:17.880> top<00:01:17.909> model<00:01:18.600> one<00:01:18.779> this<00:01:18.990> is<00:01:19.049> the<00:01:19.200> helix

00:01:20.349 --> 00:01:20.359 
to the top model one this is the helix

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:23.599 
to the top model one this is the helix
7si<00:01:21.359> and<00:01:21.749> GPS<00:01:22.439> so<00:01:22.679> this<00:01:22.829> is<00:01:22.950> going<00:01:23.100> to<00:01:23.159> have<00:01:23.340> all

00:01:23.599 --> 00:01:23.609 
7si and GPS so this is going to have all

00:01:23.609 --> 00:01:25.190 
7si and GPS so this is going to have all
the<00:01:24.060> bells<00:01:24.240> and<00:01:24.420> whistles<00:01:24.509> this<00:01:24.869> is<00:01:24.929> going<00:01:25.109> to

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
the bells and whistles this is going to

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.749 
the bells and whistles this is going to
have<00:01:25.289> down<00:01:25.950> image<00:01:26.399> side<00:01:26.850> image<00:01:27.439> 2d<00:01:28.439> sonar<00:01:28.950> and

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
have down image side image 2d sonar and

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.419 
have down image side image 2d sonar and
GPS<00:01:30.479> with<00:01:30.779> mapping<00:01:31.139> now<00:01:31.499> with<00:01:31.740> the<00:01:31.859> mapping<00:01:32.310> we

00:01:32.419 --> 00:01:32.429 
GPS with mapping now with the mapping we

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:34.010 
GPS with mapping now with the mapping we
can<00:01:32.579> put<00:01:32.729> the<00:01:32.849> lake<00:01:33.029> master<00:01:33.450> chips<00:01:33.689> in<00:01:33.840> there

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
can put the lake master chips in there

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.349 
can put the lake master chips in there
and<00:01:34.590> adjust<00:01:35.099> the<00:01:35.189> lake<00:01:35.459> levels<00:01:35.880> for<00:01:36.029> the<00:01:36.060> lakes
