8.3<00:00:42.750> and<00:00:43.309> the<00:00:44.309> reason<00:00:44.579> I<00:00:44.670> said<00:00:44.879> downgrade<00:00:45.360> is

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
8.3 and the reason I said downgrade is

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.360 
8.3 and the reason I said downgrade is
because<00:00:45.870> this<00:00:46.110> will<00:00:46.320> change<00:00:46.530> minecraft<00:00:46.920> PE

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370

you're not jailbroken and you updated to
iOS<00:00:53.550> 8.3<00:00:54.030> then<00:00:54.960> if<00:00:55.559> you<00:00:55.980> download<00:00:56.489> maps<00:00:56.730> with
