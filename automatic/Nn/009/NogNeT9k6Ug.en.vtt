00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.760
 If you come to a conclusion: tell the gospel is just empty talk, 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.185
 You have come to a conclusion that Jesus Christ never reached, 

00:00:12.185 --> 00:00:16.864
 Paul or any follower of Christ never reached a conclusion. 

00:00:16.864 --> 00:00:20.031
 Men and women draw these conclusions based on God’s sovereignty. 

00:00:20.031 --> 00:00:25.348
 Because they are using their own secular minds 

00:00:25.348 --> 00:00:29.499
 I came to the conclusion that there is any meaning about God’s sovereignty. 

00:00:29.499 --> 00:00:35.755
 Behold, if you don’t read the Bible from time to time, 

00:00:35.755 --> 00:00:38.906
 To feel the balance of the Bible, 

00:00:38.906 --> 00:00:44.597
 Always use the Bible to review your own conclusions and you will make mistakes. 

00:00:44.797 --> 00:00:48.966
 You will either say, "This invitation to the gospel is valid, so God has no sovereignty." 

00:00:48.966 --> 00:00:53.849
 You will either say, "God has sovereignty, so this is just empty talk." 

00:00:53.849 --> 00:00:58.085
 This is not the right conclusion. The correct conclusion is: 

00:00:58.085 --> 00:01:01.088
 Has anyone fallen? 

00:01:01.088 --> 00:01:05.440
 Totally fallen? Born to be fallen? Yes! 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:11.026
 Does God have sovereignty? Have! Is salvation out of the Lord? Yes! 

00:01:11.026 --> 00:01:15.515
 If the Father is not attractive, can people not come to Christ? Yes! 

00:01:15.515 --> 00:01:18.102
 Has the man been told to come to Jesus? Yes! 

00:01:18.102 --> 00:01:20.286
 If they come, will they be saved? meeting! 

00:01:20.286 --> 00:01:23.681
 Do they have the responsibility to come and be saved? They are absolutely responsible! 

00:01:23.681 --> 00:01:27.144
 Does the Bible have enough sufficiency to say atonement: 

00:01:27.144 --> 00:01:31.301
 If they come, is this enough to save them and wash away all their sins? 

00:01:31.301 --> 00:01:35.552
 There is no doubt about this! If a person does not come, is it a crime? Count! 

00:01:35.552 --> 00:01:39.267
 If they don't come, they can't come because they love their idols more. 

00:01:39.267 --> 00:01:42.003
 There is only one reason to stop people from coming to Christ: 

00:01:42.003 --> 00:01:45.028
 Because people are evilly dependent on sin. 

00:01:45.028 --> 00:01:48.329
 This is the words of the Bible, the sin of man, the heavens, 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:52.582
 God wants to throw people into hell, for their rebellious sins, 

00:01:52.582 --> 00:01:55.776
 They sinned against the sins of God and they refused to come and punish them. 

00:01:55.776 --> 00:02:00.076
 If anyone believes that God’s punishment will not come to them, 

00:02:00.076 --> 00:02:02.168
 They will be saved. 

00:02:02.168 --> 00:02:05.474
 If they don't believe it, they don't believe it. 

00:02:05.474 --> 00:02:09.960
 Jesus said, "But you will not come to me to come to life." (John 5:40) 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:15.424
 Because they refuse to come, they will perish in their sins, and they must be responsible. 

00:02:15.424 --> 00:02:19.764
 This is the word of the Bible, we want to preach the gospel, 

00:02:19.764 --> 00:02:22.960
 Tell people to reconcile with God. 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:27.925
 According to the adequacy of the atonement, all this has been prepared. 

00:02:27.925 --> 00:02:32.545
 If they don’t come, the family has a good reason to lose their temper. 

00:02:32.545 --> 00:02:36.966
 His anger will make these people burn in hell. 

00:02:36.966 --> 00:02:39.552
 This is the teaching of the Bible. 

00:02:39.552 --> 00:02:43.524
 In the end, is there a group of chosen people of God? You better believe it! 

00:02:43.524 --> 00:02:47.259
 But no one will be excused from their responsibilities because they have not been chosen. 

00:02:47.259 --> 00:02:51.247
 Sinners are called sinners in the Bible! 

00:02:51.247 --> 00:02:54.876
 If they are willing to let go of their rebellious weapons, 

00:02:54.876 --> 00:02:58.681
 If they are willing to fall to the embrace of Christ's mercy, 

00:02:58.681 --> 00:03:00.850
 They will be redeemed. 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:06.307
 Many people heard it, they repented, and they believed that they were saved. 

00:03:06.307 --> 00:03:10.455
 If they can’t hear, the Bible says it’s because they refuse to listen. 

00:03:10.455 --> 00:03:12.753
 They refused to come, they refused to believe, 

00:03:12.753 --> 00:03:16.485
 Because of their praising praise, they love the field, 

00:03:16.485 --> 00:03:19.347
 They love cows, they love their wives (beyond love gods), 

00:03:19.347 --> 00:03:23.596
 So they can’t come; because people don’t come, this sets people’s sins. 

00:03:23.596 --> 00:03:28.409
 This reveals the fact that they want to be evil for them 

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:31.283
 Take responsibility alone. 

00:03:31.283 --> 00:03:38.174
 People are criminals, because people refuse to come, their hearts are against God. 

00:03:38.174 --> 00:03:42.477
 They hate God, which is why they refuse to come. 

00:03:42.477 --> 00:03:46.797
 This is not a legitimate reason before God. 

00:03:46.797 --> 00:03:55.874
 This sin will be severely punished according to righteousness. 

00:03:55.874 --> 00:04:00.139
 This will be subject to the most rigorous justice, because this is a big crime, 

00:04:00.139 --> 00:04:04.250
 You don't know how much this sin is offensive to God. 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:08.541
 This is a very evil crime. This is the attitude of the Bible to people who refuse to come. 

00:04:08.541 --> 00:04:13.339
 The fault lies in the person who refused to come. 

00:04:13.339 --> 00:04:19.607
 We are very grateful to God because God has overcome the hardships in our hearts. 

00:04:19.607 --> 00:04:23.607
 God softens our hearts, and God gives us the ears we are willing to listen to. 

00:04:23.607 --> 00:04:30.257
 We can thank God because God does not let us continue to love our sins and then go to hell. 

00:04:30.257 --> 00:04:34.978
 Everyone who goes to hell is willing to pay. 

00:04:35.178 --> 00:04:40.339
 They love sin, and God allows them to do whatever they want. 

00:04:40.339 --> 00:04:44.969
 In the end, no one will find a mistake in God. 

00:04:44.969 --> 00:04:49.481
 Because God is letting them do what they want. 

00:04:49.481 --> 00:04:53.844
 They want to go to crime, and God lets them get what they want. 

00:04:53.844 --> 00:04:59.257
 We must balance the sovereignty of God and the responsibility of man. 

00:04:59.257 --> 00:05:04.112
 In the end, how do you make these perfect blends? The Bible did not try to do this, 

00:05:04.112 --> 00:05:07.226
 Do you know when the Bible is silent? 

00:05:07.226 --> 00:05:11.165
 Many people think that they must give an answer. 

00:05:11.165 --> 00:05:15.570
 But the problem is that there are certain things, and the Bible does not give us the answer. 

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:19.019
 There is no answer here, we don’t feel that we have to 

00:05:19.019 --> 00:05:24.383
 Give an answer, but we can see that both aspects are truth. 

00:05:24.383 --> 00:05:29.219
 I can guarantee that there is no gap here. 

00:05:29.219 --> 00:05:33.782
 Look! Jesus Christ is crying for sinners. 

00:05:33.782 --> 00:05:38.470
 Jesus Christ said, "I tell you these things are to save you." 

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:44.652
 Heavenly Father calls out to people who are unwilling to obey. 

00:05:44.652 --> 00:05:48.147
 Commanded people to come. Come to me. 

00:05:48.147 --> 00:05:53.493
 There are many of these invitations, and there are countless in the Bible. 

00:05:53.493 --> 00:05:57.337
 No one goes to hell 

00:05:57.337 --> 00:06:03.764
 Because they lack one of the most affectionate demands. Do you remember that I said this? 

00:06:03.764 --> 00:06:05.964
 How is God portrayed? 

00:06:05.964 --> 00:06:11.207
 When the prodigal son came home, he was far away. 

00:06:11.207 --> 00:06:18.096
 The father ran to meet the sinner. 

00:06:18.096 --> 00:06:24.288
 This is not a way that I or Charles Spurgeon came up with. 

00:06:24.288 --> 00:06:28.908
 This is the way God shows Himself to us.
