00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:04.379
 absolutely because animals according to 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.930
 we towards the strict rigor 

00:00:04.379 --> 00:00:10.680
 we are hairless monkeys for that 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:12.300
 we came from a line of apes with 

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:13.710
 the whales could our planet 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.730
 be the cats who have 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.590
 developed and they would be other 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.110
 features would be more creatures 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.480
 introverted who look deeply at a 

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:23.279
 little more uprooted that obviously is 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.260
 together they reproduce but each one 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.850
 living in your square meter you will feel 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.010
 that we all have the characteristics of 

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:31.050
 we are gregarious we are in a lot 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.160
 we should only need to be 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.139
 entertained 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.729
 we are one evolved the one cat one 

00:00:34.139 --> 00:00:37.019
 evolved fish have the 

00:00:35.729 --> 00:00:38.940
 characteristics probably own 

00:00:37.019 --> 00:00:40.409
 these animals and in relation to this that 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.389
 we are seeing the reptilians and the 

00:00:40.409 --> 00:00:44.940
 Mexicans or the Aztec civilizations 

00:00:42.389 --> 00:00:46.499
 they had to quetzalcóatl via kukulcán what 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.499
 good that he mentions that because not only 

00:00:46.499 --> 00:00:51.209
 the Mexicans the oriental risks and 

00:00:49.499 --> 00:00:53.129
 the orientals talk about dragons 

00:00:51.209 --> 00:00:55.289
 that the snakes that fly the 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.719
 great gods know according to culture 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:00.989
 big mapuche greetings to all of them 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:02.350
 out funds understand screeds 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.560
 notice 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:08.140
 by train and road but in two snakes 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:10.330
 they are all the same story well 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.280
 let's paste a brush stroke precisely 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:14.020
 for the subject of the bertilia there is a 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.399
 great man a big hello to him though 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:17.770
 we have had some exchange of 

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:20.380
 information in the Lord of my bagpipe and 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:22.270
 we have support regarding reptilians 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.850
 please let's see it and I'm going to 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:27.039
 explain exactly the dragos the 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:29.020
 dragons and in fact it's in the bible it 

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:31.180
 supposed to have created and that went down to 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.740
 tell him hear the let's see more 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:34.810
 smart that is the same thing that was 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:36.909
 as in I promise Greek literature a 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:38.470
 reptile a snake a snake what 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:40.300
 curious because it has to do a little bit with 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:42.460
 all with the same what we are seeing 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:44.679
 are the origins or the most 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:46.390
 primitive of these creatures and I do not 

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:48.490
 I want to go to the pig but I want so 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:49.960
 less hit a pasadita yes gentlemen 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:52.810
 there are many of those creatures among 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:54.850
 us and that have managed to adopt a 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:57.880
 human aspect when in reality it does not 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:59.799
 are not the Egyptians have that 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.690
 they also worship are actually in the 

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:03.759
 chains they call what the gringos 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:06.280
 they call shapeshifter it's worth saying they have the 

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:07.390
 ability to change their shape 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.759
 they can create illusion 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:13.390
 can alter your body are like 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:15.550
 Chameleons have the characteristic in 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:16.930
 when are they chasing the machine and 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:20.170
 there is a reptilian that is a 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:23.290
 de facto taborda transformer and uader 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:26.320
 you know here it looks at 85% the 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:28.390
 today's modern reptilian to the tree only 

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:30.400
 that that red face with the tips of 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:31.660
 really only need that instead of 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.790
 points are as well as a few 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:36.040
 little suitcase but it's 80 percent 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:40.600
 annual are very similar we are seeing 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:42.580
 the ancient pre-Columbian cultures and 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:44.830
 installing the Sumerian and everything else and 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:46.360
 he provokes them in adoration 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:48.430
 famous gods that I called them 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:51.459
 creators and as I tell you in all 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:53.410
 cultures of the world a snake had 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:56.170
 to do with our flowering of 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:58.480
 knowledge the bible of the serpent 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:01.180
 from the genesis of the bible the dragons 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:03.489
 flying in the east that which or the 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:05.290
 plumed serpent of mexico and the 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:09.070
 Central American and North American culture 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:10.600
 and cudeca and kaibil and 33 that are the 

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:12.489
 snakes that generate the human race 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:13.530
 according to the Mapuche culture what 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:16.200
 coincidence 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:18.240
 it's a snake that came in I grab you 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:21.990
 intelligent person all the same 

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:26.280
 history everything fits any style 

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:28.740
 because in another because it was given if it is not the 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:30.989
 way you can get a first one is a 

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:34.819
 suspicious match garonne first 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:39.540
 it's curious just not in this way 

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:41.520
 are currently currently viewed as well 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:43.260
 of course of course but the 

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:44.459
 reptilians managed to adapt now there are 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.410
 what to say the reptilians have to 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:48.420
 understand that they exist are all bad and 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:49.800
 dominators if you really have to see 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:53.400
 how those castes that stayed in 

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:55.110
 the planet but there are also very very 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:58.140
 wise very great and they have helped 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:04:00.269
 in different ways in fact what to 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:01.739
 purpose the moon here always touches the 

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:04.110
 Topic him in a vision feature 

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:06.180
 reptilian those who supposedly live 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:08.880
 on the planet that is about to happen and all 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:11.850
 they are this way in January exactly and 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:13.210
 it is also curious that the 

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:15.550
 Bible 

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:18.190
 of a reptile like the one that tempts the 

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:19.930
 man with his facet what turns him 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:22.170
 because within its harmony it takes it out and 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:24.880
 those to eat from the tree of knowledge 

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:26.500
 but not of life does not give you the secret in 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:29.080
 the eternal life that they have it only 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:30.880
 It gives you 20 because some of it is 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:33.430
 he composed but notice that the snake 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:34.990
 blue for solís friend you chose 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:36.760
 that was dying but deep down it's not going to 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:39.220
 die if you join that woman 

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:41.380
 you can have children and can continue 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:43.960
 living gave them a little secret read from 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:48.120
 one last songs and he takes out all house 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:48.120
 friends snakes said the son 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:55.650
 the book of the jungle we have something more 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:59.500
 we can achieve a lot 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:05:01.990
 to the queen and have I have an advance to 

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:03.910
 see I want to see I want to say something in the 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:06.730
 library of esoteric characteristics to 

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:09.460
 the flower in all managed to finally bring 

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:11.689
 the translated books of dignity the 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:14.330
 sons of the matrix 

00:05:11.689 --> 00:05:16.129
 the best kept secret in the world 

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:17.959
 all those things are already in chile this 

00:05:16.129 --> 00:05:19.729
 to find the life books and their 

00:05:17.959 --> 00:05:21.319
 videos are spectacular he was the 

00:05:19.729 --> 00:05:23.539
 first to open your eyes say that 

00:05:21.319 --> 00:05:24.949
 has that common in the woods family with 

00:05:23.539 --> 00:05:28.759
 Queen Isabella II with many others 

00:05:24.949 --> 00:05:29.869
 powerful a small preview of what 

00:05:28.759 --> 00:05:32.649
 we're going to be probably talking 

00:05:29.869 --> 00:05:35.119
 morning attention listen to me well this is 

00:05:32.649 --> 00:05:37.549
 important this is not going to be a little 

00:05:35.119 --> 00:05:40.429
 limit of what some can absorb 

00:05:37.549 --> 00:05:41.779
 in terms of any knowledge here 

00:05:40.429 --> 00:05:43.909
 to tell us there is a lot of name 

00:05:41.779 --> 00:05:45.679
 really but I make my vegans more 

00:05:43.909 --> 00:05:47.419
 gentlemen please you what serves them 

00:05:45.679 --> 00:05:49.999
 I took what we're not going to 

00:05:47.419 --> 00:05:51.919
 little metal awaits mines that arrived 

00:05:49.999 --> 00:05:53.179
 long ago on earth not 

00:05:51.919 --> 00:05:55.909
 they looked like the queen of england 

00:05:53.179 --> 00:05:57.709
 but they were of a kind between snakes and 

00:05:55.909 --> 00:06:00.079
 lizards but have been passed by 

00:05:57.709 --> 00:06:04.189
 crossed the ancient reptilian part 

00:06:00.079 --> 00:06:06.559
 it just has not disappeared like this is 

00:06:04.189 --> 00:06:09.110
 of life in the big one that reptiles is 

00:06:06.559 --> 00:06:10.759
 just that it's not just an extra way 

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:12.529
 begins or the video cart I'm your 

00:06:10.759 --> 00:06:16.209
 tribe science is to say the books 

00:06:12.529 --> 00:06:16.209
 they are available I make a good gift 

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:28.190
 but I've talked to hundreds of people 

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:30.740
 in the whole world fixed and researched this 

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:32.840
 and more than 40 countries and they have always 

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:36.200
 told basically the same story 

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:38.260
 recurrent and notice that reptilians 

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:41.030
 by chance it 's because the energy 

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:43.310
 even benjamin franklin is just 

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:44.840
 they know that the president of the USA 

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:46.820
 they found all this amount of children 

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:48.710
 dead in his yard the one who if the one 

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:51.070
 appears to the $ 5 bill but that 

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:51.070
 it's another story
