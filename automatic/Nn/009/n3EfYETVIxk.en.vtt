with him these last three months the

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:12.680 
with him these last three months the
main<00:00:10.590> reason<00:00:10.860> why<00:00:11.400> I<00:00:11.429> haven't<00:00:12.000> put<00:00:12.300> it<00:00:12.389> any

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
main reason why I haven't put it any

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.369 
main reason why I haven't put it any
videos<00:00:13.380> is<00:00:13.710> because<00:00:13.889> I<00:00:14.490> had<00:00:15.059> my<00:00:15.240> hair<00:00:15.750> in<00:00:16.020> the

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
videos is because I had my hair in the

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.859 
videos is because I had my hair in the
two<00:00:16.560> strand<00:00:16.890> twist<00:00:17.220> for<00:00:17.550> two<00:00:17.820> months<00:00:18.180> and<00:00:18.359> then

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
two strand twist for two months and then

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.759 
two strand twist for two months and then
take<00:00:19.080> them<00:00:19.199> out<00:00:19.439> until<00:00:21.230> the<00:00:22.230> second<00:00:22.619> or<00:00:22.710> third

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
take them out until the second or third

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.540 
take them out until the second or third
week<00:00:23.189> of<00:00:23.369> februari<00:00:24.060> so<00:00:24.900> I<00:00:25.320> was<00:00:25.529> really<00:00:25.800> limited

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
week of februari so I was really limited

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.349 
week of februari so I was really limited
to<00:00:27.000> the<00:00:27.480> styles<00:00:27.990> but<00:00:28.410> I<00:00:28.939> could<00:00:29.939> do<00:00:30.060> with<00:00:30.240> my

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
to the styles but I could do with my

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:35.420 
to the styles but I could do with my
hair<00:00:30.660> so<00:00:31.140> I<00:00:32.239> would<00:00:33.239> mainly<00:00:34.200> just<00:00:34.680> retwist<00:00:35.250> my

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
hair so I would mainly just retwist my

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.340 
hair so I would mainly just retwist my
hair<00:00:35.780> to<00:00:37.070> make<00:00:38.070> the<00:00:38.309> edges<00:00:38.510> or<00:00:39.510> make<00:00:39.870> my<00:00:40.079> hair

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
hair to make the edges or make my hair

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:41.540 
hair to make the edges or make my hair
look<00:00:40.379> a<00:00:40.680> little<00:00:40.829> bit<00:00:41.010> neater<00:00:41.250> and<00:00:41.370> more

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
look a little bit neater and more

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.510 
look a little bit neater and more
presentable<00:00:42.000> when<00:00:42.450> I<00:00:42.510> did<00:00:42.809> go<00:00:42.989> out<00:00:43.020> and<00:00:43.520> that's

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
presentable when I did go out and that's

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.610 
presentable when I did go out and that's
basically<00:00:44.820> it<00:00:45.210> I<00:00:45.570> didn't<00:00:45.870> really<00:00:45.989> do<00:00:46.230> too<00:00:46.260> much

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
basically it I didn't really do too much

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.860 
basically it I didn't really do too much
with<00:00:46.829> my<00:00:46.890> hair<00:00:47.309> while<00:00:47.640> my<00:00:48.270> hair<00:00:48.510> was<00:00:48.629> in<00:00:48.780> that

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
with my hair while my hair was in that

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.069 
with my hair while my hair was in that
protective<00:00:49.410> style<00:00:50.120> so<00:00:51.120> that's<00:00:51.660> one<00:00:51.930> of<00:00:51.960> the

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
protective style so that's one of the

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.229 
protective style so that's one of the
reasons<00:00:52.410> why<00:00:52.680> didn't<00:00:53.070> put<00:00:53.219> up<00:00:53.340> any<00:00:53.460> videos<00:00:53.879> for

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
reasons why didn't put up any videos for

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.920 
reasons why didn't put up any videos for
