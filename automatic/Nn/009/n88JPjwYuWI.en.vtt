by<00:01:50.870> feeding<00:01:51.200> it<00:01:51.290> through<00:01:51.320> the<00:01:51.560> back<00:01:56.409> and<00:01:57.580> then

00:01:58.570 --> 00:01:58.580 
by feeding it through the back and then

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:07.039 
by feeding it through the back and then
just<00:01:58.760> light<00:01:58.880> this<00:01:59.000> one<00:01:59.150> in<00:01:59.300> from<00:01:59.450> the<00:01:59.570> top

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.660 

now<00:02:07.560> we're<00:02:07.680> going<00:02:07.770> to<00:02:07.829> take<00:02:07.979> this<00:02:08.099> screw<00:02:08.369> and

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
now we're going to take this screw and

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.130 
now we're going to take this screw and
secure<00:02:09.149> the<00:02:09.300> back<00:02:09.450> of<00:02:09.629> the<00:02:09.720> clamp

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
secure the back of the clamp

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.380 
secure the back of the clamp
now<00:02:10.890> before<00:02:11.190> Kelly<00:02:11.430> completely<00:02:12.060> tightens

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
now before Kelly completely tightens

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
now before Kelly completely tightens
that<00:02:12.480> down<00:02:12.629> over<00:02:12.840> there<00:02:12.959> we're<00:02:13.110> going<00:02:13.230> to<00:02:13.319> take

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
that down over there we're going to take

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.740 
that down over there we're going to take
our<00:02:13.560> side<00:02:13.800> plate<00:02:14.099> and<00:02:14.400> we're<00:02:15.060> going<00:02:15.209> to<00:02:15.239> set<00:02:15.510> it

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
our side plate and we're going to set it

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:19.130 
our side plate and we're going to set it
up<00:02:15.780> in<00:02:16.019> place<00:02:16.230> and<00:02:16.590> verify<00:02:17.489> that<00:02:17.819> the<00:02:18.660> distance

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
up in place and verify that the distance

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.500 
up in place and verify that the distance
between<00:02:19.290> our<00:02:19.500> clamps<00:02:19.920> is<00:02:20.040> perfect<00:02:20.459> that<00:02:21.300> that

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
between our clamps is perfect that that

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:22.580 
between our clamps is perfect that that
looks<00:02:21.690> great<00:02:21.870> Kelly<00:02:22.110> go<00:02:22.290> ahead<00:02:22.410> and<00:02:22.500> tighten

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
looks great Kelly go ahead and tighten

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.220 
looks great Kelly go ahead and tighten
those<00:02:22.769> down<00:02:23.269> now<00:02:24.269> that<00:02:24.450> installation<00:02:24.750> on<00:02:25.080> this

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
those down now that installation on this

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:26.479 
those down now that installation on this
side<00:02:25.410> is<00:02:25.560> complete<00:02:25.950> we'll<00:02:26.129> go<00:02:26.250> ahead<00:02:26.370> and

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:26.489 
side is complete we'll go ahead and

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:28.369 
side is complete we'll go ahead and
install<00:02:26.790> on<00:02:26.970> the<00:02:27.060> other<00:02:27.209> side<00:02:27.480> and<00:02:27.750> then<00:02:27.959> mount

while performing this measurement you

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:06.740 
while performing this measurement you
want<00:03:05.430> to<00:03:05.519> make<00:03:05.700> sure<00:03:05.910> that<00:03:06.120> the<00:03:06.269> tape<00:03:06.510> measure

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
want to make sure that the tape measure

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:08.539 
want to make sure that the tape measure
is<00:03:07.019> at<00:03:07.170> roughly<00:03:07.560> the<00:03:07.680> angle<00:03:08.069> the<00:03:08.190> windshield

is<00:03:08.640> going<00:03:08.760> to<00:03:08.819> be<00:03:08.940> at<00:03:09.120> if<00:03:09.329> you<00:03:09.900> go<00:03:10.079> straight<00:03:10.319> up

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
is going to be at if you go straight up

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:11.809 
is going to be at if you go straight up
and<00:03:10.650> down<00:03:10.680> you're<00:03:11.069> going<00:03:11.160> to<00:03:11.250> get<00:03:11.459> a<00:03:11.489> false

00:03:11.809 --> 00:03:11.819
