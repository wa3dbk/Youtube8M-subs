00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:27.740 
we'll see if you get it or not I don't

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:31.420 
we'll see if you get it or not I don't
know<00:00:27.830> anyway<00:00:28.780> here<00:00:29.780> you<00:00:30.350> can<00:00:30.740> see<00:00:30.980> I<00:00:31.010> am<00:00:31.400> using

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:31.430 
know anyway here you can see I am using

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:36.220 
know anyway here you can see I am using
GoPro<00:00:32.239> studio<00:00:33.190> 2.5<00:00:34.190> and<00:00:34.640> we've<00:00:35.450> introduced<00:00:35.960> a

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:36.230 
GoPro studio 2.5 and we've introduced a

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:38.440 
GoPro studio 2.5 and we've introduced a
brand<00:00:36.440> new<00:00:36.650> feature<00:00:36.920> in<00:00:37.310> GoPro<00:00:37.760> studio<00:00:37.940> 2.5

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:38.450 
brand new feature in GoPro studio 2.5

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:44.170 
brand new feature in GoPro studio 2.5
called<00:00:38.720> flex<00:00:39.640> which<00:00:40.640> is<00:00:40.670> basically<00:00:42.130> our<00:00:43.180> way

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:44.180 
called flex which is basically our way

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:47.670 
called flex which is basically our way
to<00:00:44.500> give<00:00:45.500> you<00:00:45.710> the<00:00:45.860> ability<00:00:46.070> to<00:00:46.280> create<00:00:47.210> much

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:47.680 
to give you the ability to create much

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.560 
to give you the ability to create much
smoother<00:00:48.680> slow<00:00:49.130> motion<00:00:49.550> I<00:00:49.850> basically<00:00:50.450> just

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:50.570 
smoother slow motion I basically just

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:54.459 
smoother slow motion I basically just
assembled<00:00:51.260> a<00:00:52.420> basic<00:00:53.420> timeline<00:00:53.660> here<00:00:54.140> I<00:00:54.350> took

00:00:54.459 --> 00:00:54.469 
assembled a basic timeline here I took

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:56.590 
assembled a basic timeline here I took
my<00:00:54.770> Jeep<00:00:55.450> off-roading

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:56.600 
my Jeep off-roading

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.520 
my Jeep off-roading
the<00:00:57.410> other<00:00:57.530> day<00:00:57.739> and<00:00:58.690> I<00:00:59.690> wanted<00:00:59.989> to<00:01:00.140> slow<00:01:00.350> down

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:00.530 
the other day and I wanted to slow down

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:02.380 
the other day and I wanted to slow down
some<00:01:00.829> of<00:01:00.860> these<00:01:00.950> shots<00:01:01.250> this<00:01:01.489> footage<00:01:02.030> here

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:02.390 
some of these shots this footage here

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.529 
some of these shots this footage here
that<00:01:02.660> you<00:01:02.719> see<00:01:02.960> is<00:01:03.189> 1440<00:01:04.189> resolution<00:01:04.219> and<00:01:05.119> 48

00:01:05.529 --> 00:01:05.539 
that you see is 1440 resolution and 48

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:08.469 
that you see is 1440 resolution and 48
frames<00:01:05.749> per<00:01:05.899> second<00:01:06.380> so<00:01:07.159> the<00:01:07.490> more<00:01:07.700> the<00:01:08.359> higher

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:08.479 
frames per second so the more the higher

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:11.139 
frames per second so the more the higher
the<00:01:08.659> frame<00:01:08.840> rate<00:01:09.020> you<00:01:09.049> start<00:01:09.439> with<00:01:10.149> typically

00:01:11.139 --> 00:01:11.149 
the frame rate you start with typically

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:12.639 
the frame rate you start with typically
the<00:01:11.299> better<00:01:11.450> results<00:01:11.869> you're<00:01:11.990> gonna<00:01:12.109> get<00:01:12.380> and

00:01:12.639 --> 00:01:12.649 
the better results you're gonna get and

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:17.649 
the better results you're gonna get and
the<00:01:13.369> slower<00:01:13.700> you<00:01:14.030> can<00:01:14.179> slow<00:01:14.450> it<00:01:14.479> down<00:01:16.179> and<00:01:17.179> what

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:17.659 
the slower you can slow it down and what

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:20.289 
the slower you can slow it down and what
flux<00:01:17.990> will<00:01:18.079> let<00:01:18.200> you<00:01:18.289> do<00:01:18.439> is<00:01:18.740> if<00:01:19.520> you<00:01:20.060> want<00:01:20.240> to

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:20.299 
flux will let you do is if you want to

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:23.230 
flux will let you do is if you want to
go<00:01:20.389> slower<00:01:20.779> than<00:01:21.259> the<00:01:22.029> maximum<00:01:23.029> amount<00:01:23.149> of

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:23.240 
go slower than the maximum amount of

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:24.660 
go slower than the maximum amount of
frames<00:01:23.509> that<00:01:23.600> you're<00:01:23.779> actually<00:01:24.049> working<00:01:24.229> with

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:24.670 
frames that you're actually working with

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:27.219 
frames that you're actually working with
you<00:01:25.670> can<00:01:25.850> do<00:01:26.029> that<00:01:26.179> and<00:01:26.299> it'll<00:01:26.509> create<00:01:26.689> smooth

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:27.229 
you can do that and it'll create smooth

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:30.519 
you can do that and it'll create smooth
in-between<00:01:27.799> frames<00:01:29.020> so<00:01:30.020> this<00:01:30.349> particular

00:01:30.519 --> 00:01:30.529 
in-between frames so this particular

00:01:30.529 --> 00:01:32.679 
in-between frames so this particular
shot<00:01:31.039> I'm<00:01:31.249> gonna<00:01:31.639> play<00:01:31.819> it<00:01:31.880> through<00:01:32.119> here<00:01:32.389> with

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:32.689 
shot I'm gonna play it through here with

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:34.389 
shot I'm gonna play it through here with
slow<00:01:33.109> motion<00:01:33.259> applied<00:01:33.679> and<00:01:33.920> you'll<00:01:34.009> see<00:01:34.219> what

00:01:34.389 --> 00:01:34.399 
slow motion applied and you'll see what

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:36.190 
slow motion applied and you'll see what
it<00:01:34.579> has<00:01:34.759> typically<00:01:35.299> looked<00:01:35.539> like<00:01:35.689> without<00:01:35.899> any

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:36.200 
it has typically looked like without any

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.969 
it has typically looked like without any
flux<00:01:36.560> plug<00:01:38.229> so<00:01:39.229> as<00:01:39.289> you<00:01:39.439> can<00:01:39.560> see<00:01:39.619> there<00:01:39.950> I

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:39.979 
flux plug so as you can see there I

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:47.379 
flux plug so as you can see there I
slowed<00:01:40.369> this<00:01:40.520> shot<00:01:42.340> down<00:01:43.340> to<00:01:44.829> 25%<00:01:46.090> so<00:01:47.090> I'm

00:01:47.379 --> 00:01:47.389 
slowed this shot down to 25% so I'm

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:51.389 
slowed this shot down to 25% so I'm
basically<00:01:48.310> doubling<00:01:49.310> frames<00:01:50.149> at<00:01:50.779> that

00:01:51.389 --> 00:01:51.399 
basically doubling frames at that

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:54.249 
basically doubling frames at that
percentage<00:01:52.399> at<00:01:52.609> 48<00:01:52.969> frames<00:01:52.999> per<00:01:53.299> second<00:01:53.599> or<00:01:53.689> 24

00:01:54.249 --> 00:01:54.259 
percentage at 48 frames per second or 24

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:55.749 
percentage at 48 frames per second or 24
time<00:01:54.590> base<00:01:54.799> you're<00:01:55.069> gonna<00:01:55.159> get<00:01:55.340> 50%

00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:55.759 
time base you're gonna get 50%

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:57.459 
time base you're gonna get 50%
slow-motion<00:01:56.479> without<00:01:56.689> doubling<00:01:57.020> any<00:01:57.200> frames

00:01:57.459 --> 00:01:57.469 
slow-motion without doubling any frames

00:01:57.469 --> 00:02:00.039 
slow-motion without doubling any frames
so<00:01:58.340> I<00:01:58.399> went<00:01:58.609> half<00:01:58.909> that<00:01:59.149> amount<00:01:59.209> now<00:01:59.689> I've<00:01:59.869> got

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:00.049 
so I went half that amount now I've got

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:01.979 
so I went half that amount now I've got
one<00:02:00.169> more<00:02:00.229> slow<00:02:00.590> motion<00:02:00.799> shot<00:02:00.919> after<00:02:01.159> this

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:01.989 
one more slow motion shot after this

00:02:01.989 --> 00:02:05.139 
one more slow motion shot after this
this<00:02:02.989> one<00:02:03.229> here<00:02:03.619> and<00:02:03.799> then<00:02:04.310> on<00:02:04.429> this<00:02:04.579> shot<00:02:04.880> I'm

00:02:05.139 --> 00:02:05.149 
this one here and then on this shot I'm

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:10.630 
this one here and then on this shot I'm
gonna<00:02:05.329> go<00:02:05.539> all<00:02:05.779> the<00:02:05.899> way<00:02:05.929> down<00:02:06.969> to<00:02:08.500> 15.4%

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
gonna go all the way down to 15.4%

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.880 
gonna go all the way down to 15.4%
so<00:02:11.300> you're<00:02:11.510> gonna<00:02:11.600> have<00:02:11.840> almost<00:02:12.320> tripling<00:02:12.650> of

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
so you're gonna have almost tripling of

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:14.920 
so you're gonna have almost tripling of
frames<00:02:13.130> there<00:02:13.400> and<00:02:13.700> what<00:02:14.090> flux<00:02:14.390> is<00:02:14.510> gonna<00:02:14.720> do

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
frames there and what flux is gonna do

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:17.350 
frames there and what flux is gonna do
is<00:02:15.110> interpolate<00:02:15.860> in<00:02:16.550> between<00:02:16.880> those<00:02:17.060> frames

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
is interpolate in between those frames

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.720 
is interpolate in between those frames
and<00:02:17.600> create<00:02:17.870> a<00:02:17.930> slower<00:02:18.410> slow<00:02:19.100> motion<00:02:19.460> so

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
and create a slower slow motion so

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:21.750 
and create a slower slow motion so
instead<00:02:20.180> of<00:02:20.240> the<00:02:20.390> choppiness<00:02:20.750> you<00:02:20.990> see<00:02:21.170> here

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
instead of the choppiness you see here

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.120 
instead of the choppiness you see here
on<00:02:22.990> export<00:02:23.990> you're<00:02:24.530> gonna<00:02:24.650> see<00:02:24.890> a<00:02:24.920> much

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.130 
on export you're gonna see a much

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:27.880 
on export you're gonna see a much
smoother<00:02:25.790> version<00:02:26.180> of<00:02:26.270> that<00:02:26.390> so<00:02:26.780> you<00:02:27.500> do<00:02:27.680> have

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
smoother version of that so you do have

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:33.210 
smoother version of that so you do have
the<00:02:28.040> ability<00:02:28.190> to<00:02:28.550> turn<00:02:29.510> flux<00:02:30.080> on<00:02:30.320> and<00:02:30.590> off<00:02:31.330> here

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
the ability to turn flux on and off here

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:38.860 
the ability to turn flux on and off here
using<00:02:34.220> these<00:02:34.340> check<00:02:34.730> marks<00:02:35.320> per<00:02:36.320> shot<00:02:37.390> or<00:02:38.390> you

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 
using these check marks per shot or you

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:40.870 
using these check marks per shot or you
can<00:02:38.990> do<00:02:39.110> it<00:02:39.140> globally<00:02:40.010> when<00:02:40.459> you<00:02:40.550> actually

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:40.880 
can do it globally when you actually

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:44.350 
can do it globally when you actually
export<00:02:41.300> it<00:02:41.390> here<00:02:41.570> it<00:02:41.660> says<00:02:41.980> apply<00:02:42.980> flux<00:02:43.360> for

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360 
export it here it says apply flux for

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.590 
export it here it says apply flux for
smoother<00:02:44.750> speed<00:02:45.140> changes<00:02:45.530> in<00:02:45.650> your<00:02:45.770> video

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:46.600 
smoother speed changes in your video

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.180 
smoother speed changes in your video
export<00:02:47.600> time<00:02:47.810> will<00:02:48.110> be<00:02:48.290> longer<00:02:48.500> than<00:02:48.800> usual

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.190 
export time will be longer than usual

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:51.699 
export time will be longer than usual
and<00:02:49.400> yes<00:02:50.150> indeed<00:02:50.540> that<00:02:50.780> is<00:02:50.930> true<00:02:51.140> export<00:02:51.560> time

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:51.709 
and yes indeed that is true export time

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:55.120 
and yes indeed that is true export time
will<00:02:51.950> definitely<00:02:52.700> be<00:02:53.270> longer<00:02:53.840> than<00:02:54.380> usual<00:02:54.620> so

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.130 
will definitely be longer than usual so

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:58.180 
will definitely be longer than usual so
I'm<00:02:55.700> gonna<00:02:55.850> cancel<00:02:56.209> but<00:02:56.450> that<00:02:57.320> reminds<00:02:57.680> me<00:02:57.800> a

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.190 
I'm gonna cancel but that reminds me a

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:00.640 
I'm gonna cancel but that reminds me a
really<00:02:58.910> good<00:02:59.030> point<00:02:59.239> when<00:02:59.870> it<00:02:59.989> comes<00:03:00.200> to<00:03:00.410> using

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:00.650 
really good point when it comes to using

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:03.300 
really good point when it comes to using
flux<00:03:01.100> because<00:03:01.730> of<00:03:01.880> the<00:03:01.940> render<00:03:02.209> time<00:03:02.390> is

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310 
flux because of the render time is

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:06.790 
flux because of the render time is
substantially<00:03:04.310> longer<00:03:05.590> you're<00:03:06.590> not<00:03:06.709> gonna

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:06.800 
substantially longer you're not gonna

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:10.360 
substantially longer you're not gonna
want<00:03:07.010> to<00:03:07.040> pick<00:03:07.280> a<00:03:07.690> 45<00:03:08.690> second<00:03:09.140> clip<00:03:09.350> and<00:03:09.680> export

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.370 
want to pick a 45 second clip and export

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:13.360 
want to pick a 45 second clip and export
the<00:03:10.459> entire<00:03:10.790> thing<00:03:11.120> using<00:03:11.570> flux<00:03:12.190> unless<00:03:13.190> you

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.370 
the entire thing using flux unless you

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:16.140 
the entire thing using flux unless you
have<00:03:13.580> a<00:03:13.850> lot<00:03:14.630> of<00:03:14.750> time<00:03:14.900> on<00:03:15.049> your<00:03:15.140> hands<00:03:15.320> which

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
have a lot of time on your hands which

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:19.420 
have a lot of time on your hands which
maybe<00:03:17.150> you<00:03:17.269> do<00:03:17.450> that's<00:03:17.810> cool<00:03:18.049> but<00:03:18.470> I<00:03:18.620> don't<00:03:18.709> so

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:19.430 
maybe you do that's cool but I don't so

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:21.789 
maybe you do that's cool but I don't so
I'm<00:03:19.549> not<00:03:19.670> gonna<00:03:19.820> do<00:03:20.180> that<00:03:20.209> but<00:03:20.600> also<00:03:20.959> I<00:03:21.230> just<00:03:21.560> I

00:03:21.789 --> 00:03:21.799 
I'm not gonna do that but also I just I

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:24.910 
I'm not gonna do that but also I just I
don't<00:03:22.340> I<00:03:22.640> don't<00:03:22.730> see<00:03:23.030> the<00:03:23.269> need<00:03:23.450> for<00:03:23.750> that<00:03:24.650> type

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:24.920 
don't I don't see the need for that type

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:27.600 
don't I don't see the need for that type
of<00:03:24.980> clip<00:03:25.370> so<00:03:25.640> like<00:03:26.150> for<00:03:26.330> example<00:03:26.410> you<00:03:27.410> know

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:27.610 
of clip so like for example you know

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:29.830 
of clip so like for example you know
this<00:03:28.610> clip<00:03:28.880> the<00:03:29.030> approach<00:03:29.330> you<00:03:29.540> don't<00:03:29.690> want

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840 
this clip the approach you don't want

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.009 
this clip the approach you don't want
that<00:03:29.930> to<00:03:30.110> be<00:03:30.140> slow<00:03:30.470> pick<00:03:31.370> and<00:03:31.549> choose<00:03:32.019> your

00:03:33.009 --> 00:03:33.019 
that to be slow pick and choose your

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:35.770 
that to be slow pick and choose your
your<00:03:33.500> moments<00:03:34.040> and<00:03:34.250> this<00:03:35.060> is<00:03:35.239> really<00:03:35.510> just<00:03:35.540> a

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:35.780 
your moments and this is really just a

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:39.400 
your moments and this is really just a
really<00:03:36.260> short<00:03:36.940> two<00:03:37.940> or<00:03:38.090> three<00:03:38.269> second<00:03:38.690> portion

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:39.410 
really short two or three second portion

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:42.009 
really short two or three second portion
of<00:03:39.709> the<00:03:39.950> clip<00:03:40.160> and<00:03:40.430> that's<00:03:40.549> really<00:03:41.019> best

00:03:42.009 --> 00:03:42.019 
of the clip and that's really best

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:43.180 
of the clip and that's really best
practice<00:03:42.530> there<00:03:42.709> and<00:03:42.830> then<00:03:42.920> if<00:03:43.010> you<00:03:43.070> have

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:43.190 
practice there and then if you have

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:49.800 
practice there and then if you have
music<00:03:43.930> you<00:03:44.930> know<00:03:45.769> you<00:03:45.799> can<00:03:46.070> time<00:03:46.400> it<00:03:46.430> out<00:03:48.190> and

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:49.810 
music you know you can time it out and

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:52.449 
music you know you can time it out and
there<00:03:50.810> are<00:03:50.930> some<00:03:51.110> techniques<00:03:51.680> in<00:03:51.890> studio<00:03:52.250> on

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:52.459 
there are some techniques in studio on

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:55.449 
there are some techniques in studio on
how<00:03:52.880> to<00:03:52.940> time<00:03:53.330> up<00:03:53.510> the<00:03:54.049> slow<00:03:54.260> motion<00:03:54.590> to<00:03:54.799> to

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:55.459 
how to time up the slow motion to to

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:57.370 
how to time up the slow motion to to
music<00:03:55.820> cues<00:03:56.090> and<00:03:56.239> I'll<00:03:56.330> go<00:03:56.480> over<00:03:56.570> that<00:03:57.019> in<00:03:57.080> a

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:57.380 
music cues and I'll go over that in a

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:00.490 
music cues and I'll go over that in a
future<00:03:57.799> tutorial<00:03:58.330> that<00:03:59.330> I<00:03:59.540> just<00:04:00.080> decided<00:04:00.380> that

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:00.500 
future tutorial that I just decided that

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:02.020 
future tutorial that I just decided that
will<00:04:00.709> make<00:04:00.860> I<00:04:01.100> will<00:04:01.340> definitely<00:04:01.790> be<00:04:01.910> making

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:02.030 
will make I will definitely be making

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:03.699 
will make I will definitely be making
another<00:04:02.390> tutorial<00:04:02.630> about<00:04:02.870> that<00:04:03.019> so<00:04:03.290> keep<00:04:03.590> a

00:04:03.699 --> 00:04:03.709 
another tutorial about that so keep a

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:07.449 
another tutorial about that so keep a
