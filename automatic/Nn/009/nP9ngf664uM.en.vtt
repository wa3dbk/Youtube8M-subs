that I went in with old navy and I got
this<00:00:57.030> cardigan<00:00:57.780> and<00:00:58.199> it's<00:00:58.980> just<00:00:59.129> this<00:00:59.219> blue

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
this cardigan and it's just this blue

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.180 
this cardigan and it's just this blue
cardigan<00:00:59.850> and<00:01:00.590> just<00:01:01.590> looks<00:01:01.710> like<00:01:01.829> this<00:01:02.010> I

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
cardigan and just looks like this I

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.670 
cardigan and just looks like this I
don't<00:01:02.760> really<00:01:02.910> have<00:01:03.000> a<00:01:03.149> long<00:01:03.390> proteans<00:01:03.899> so<00:01:04.650> I

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
don't really have a long proteans so I

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.160 
don't really have a long proteans so I
decided<00:01:05.220> this<00:01:05.489> one<00:01:05.700> and<00:01:06.150> it's<00:01:06.450> pretty<00:01:06.750> thin<00:01:06.960> I

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
decided this one and it's pretty thin I

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.080 
decided this one and it's pretty thin I
could<00:01:07.350> probably<00:01:07.530> still<00:01:07.860> wear<00:01:07.979> it<00:01:08.010> during<00:01:08.280> the

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
could probably still wear it during the

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.460 
could probably still wear it during the
spring<00:01:09.330> time<00:01:09.479> as<00:01:09.659> you<00:01:09.780> can<00:01:09.930> see<00:01:10.110> it's<00:01:10.260> pretty

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
spring time as you can see it's pretty

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.410 
spring time as you can see it's pretty

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:13.410 
kind of yeah it's it's a lot but I think
it'll<00:05:11.830> be<00:05:11.920> really<00:05:12.010> pretty<00:05:12.400> and<00:05:12.790> you'll

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:13.420 
it'll be really pretty and you'll

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:15.480 
it'll be really pretty and you'll
probably<00:05:13.540> see<00:05:13.870> me<00:05:13.900> wearing<00:05:14.200> this<00:05:14.290> in<00:05:14.680> some

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:15.490 
probably see me wearing this in some

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:19.590 
probably see me wearing this in some
future<00:05:15.640> videos<00:05:16.210> because<00:05:16.930> I<00:05:17.350> like<00:05:18.160> it<00:05:18.370> so<00:05:18.940> the

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:19.600 
future videos because I like it so the

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:20.940 
future videos because I like it so the
next<00:05:19.750> place<00:05:19.960> that<00:05:20.260> I<00:05:20.290> went<00:05:20.530> to<00:05:20.650> I<00:05:20.680> actually

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:20.950 
next place that I went to I actually

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:22.590 
next place that I went to I actually
went<00:05:21.280> to<00:05:21.430> today<00:05:21.760> and<00:05:21.970> I<00:05:22.090> just<00:05:22.120> got<00:05:22.390> back<00:05:22.540> from

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:22.600 
went to today and I just got back from

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:25.230 
went to today and I just got back from
there<00:05:23.020> but<00:05:23.290> I<00:05:23.530> went<00:05:23.740> to<00:05:23.890> marshalls<00:05:24.430> I<00:05:24.700> only<00:05:25.090> got

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:25.240 
there but I went to marshalls I only got

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:27.360 
there but I went to marshalls I only got
one<00:05:25.450> shirt<00:05:25.750> but<00:05:26.500> I<00:05:26.830> thought<00:05:27.070> it<00:05:27.160> was<00:05:27.250> really

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:27.370 
one shirt but I thought it was really

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:28.800 
one shirt but I thought it was really
pretty<00:05:27.460> and<00:05:27.790> I<00:05:27.880> thought<00:05:28.030> I<00:05:28.060> might<00:05:28.210> include<00:05:28.690> it

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:28.810 
pretty and I thought I might include it

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:30.900 
pretty and I thought I might include it
anyway<00:05:29.080> because<00:05:29.230> it's<00:05:29.380> pretty<00:05:29.830> springy<00:05:30.100> so<00:05:30.580> I

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:30.910 
anyway because it's pretty springy so I

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:34.290 
anyway because it's pretty springy so I
got<00:05:31.510> this<00:05:31.840> shirt<00:05:32.080> from<00:05:32.410> Marshall<00:05:33.070> so<00:05:33.520> this<00:05:34.000> is
