position and it's also got a little
cable<00:04:41.310> but<00:04:42.030> it's<00:04:42.300> actually<00:04:42.479> destroying<00:04:43.110> which

00:04:44.089 --> 00:04:44.099 
cable but it's actually destroying which

00:04:44.099 --> 00:04:46.070

is<00:04:44.250> pretty<00:04:44.490> neat<00:04:44.789> but<00:04:45.360> the<00:04:45.510> sad<00:04:45.840> thing<00:04:45.870> about

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:46.080 
is pretty neat but the sad thing about

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:47.779 
is pretty neat but the sad thing about
is<00:04:46.320> that<00:04:46.500> the<00:04:46.620> cable<00:04:46.950> doesn't<00:04:47.130> attach<00:04:47.490> it<00:04:47.760> to

00:04:47.779 --> 00:04:47.789 
is that the cable doesn't attach it to

00:04:47.789 --> 00:04:48.940 
is that the cable doesn't attach it to
anything

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:48.950 
anything

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:51.370
