00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:54.200 
attic was pushing up in their spawn so

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:56.680 
attic was pushing up in their spawn so
it's<00:03:54.349> starting<00:03:54.680> to<00:03:54.829> move<00:03:55.489> him<00:03:55.639> back<00:03:55.819> but<00:03:56.150> this

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:56.690 
it's starting to move him back but this

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:58.960 
it's starting to move him back but this
is<00:03:56.870> a<00:03:56.900> good<00:03:57.079> spot<00:03:57.319> to<00:03:57.769> kill<00:03:58.069> him<00:03:58.190> with<00:03:58.310> with<00:03:58.819> the

00:03:58.960 --> 00:03:58.970 
is a good spot to kill him with with the

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:00.699 
is a good spot to kill him with with the
ac-130<00:03:59.450> as<00:03:59.599> well<00:03:59.780> ended<00:04:00.349> up<00:04:00.440> getting<00:04:00.680> the

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:00.709 
ac-130 as well ended up getting the

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:02.379 
ac-130 as well ended up getting the
first<00:04:00.950> nuke<00:04:01.190> and<00:04:01.430> I<00:04:01.730> thought<00:04:01.910> cool<00:04:02.180> you<00:04:02.359> know

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:02.389 
first nuke and I thought cool you know

00:04:02.389 --> 00:04:04.360 
first nuke and I thought cool you know
this<00:04:02.599> is<00:04:02.629> an<00:04:02.840> early<00:04:03.049> kind<00:04:03.769> of<00:04:03.829> pretty<00:04:04.010> early

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:04.370 
this is an early kind of pretty early

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:05.409 
this is an early kind of pretty early
nuke<00:04:04.519> it<00:04:04.700> would<00:04:04.790> have<00:04:04.879> been<00:04:04.940> nice<00:04:05.150> but<00:04:05.359> I

00:04:05.409 --> 00:04:05.419 
nuke it would have been nice but I

00:04:05.419 --> 00:04:06.580 
nuke it would have been nice but I
figured<00:04:05.750> I'd<00:04:05.840> go<00:04:05.959> ahead<00:04:06.109> and<00:04:06.230> keep<00:04:06.319> playing

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:06.590 
figured I'd go ahead and keep playing

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:09.189 
figured I'd go ahead and keep playing
and<00:04:06.709> try<00:04:06.829> to<00:04:06.889> get<00:04:07.040> the<00:04:07.099> double<00:04:07.690> and<00:04:08.690> i<00:04:09.109> think

00:04:09.189 --> 00:04:09.199 
and try to get the double and i think

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:10.569 
and try to get the double and i think
i'm<00:04:09.349> going<00:04:09.440> to<00:04:09.530> start<00:04:09.680> trying<00:04:09.980> again<00:04:10.160> I've

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:10.579 
i'm going to start trying again I've

00:04:10.579 --> 00:04:12.099 
i'm going to start trying again I've
come<00:04:11.030> close<00:04:11.060> a<00:04:11.269> couple<00:04:11.480> times<00:04:11.629> to<00:04:11.900> some

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:12.109 
come close a couple times to some

00:04:12.109 --> 00:04:14.170 
come close a couple times to some
doubles<00:04:12.470> this<00:04:13.250> one<00:04:13.459> was<00:04:13.609> definitely<00:04:13.970> a<00:04:14.000> fail

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:14.180 
doubles this one was definitely a fail

these<00:04:26.690> guys<00:04:26.930> I<00:04:27.230> thought<00:04:27.500> he<00:04:27.620> was<00:04:27.740> over<00:04:27.830> here<00:04:27.920> on

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:28.100 
these guys I thought he was over here on

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:29.170 
these guys I thought he was over here on
the<00:04:28.160> right<00:04:28.280> hand<00:04:28.400> side<00:04:28.520> right<00:04:28.790> here<00:04:28.940> I<00:04:29.000> was

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:29.180 
the right hand side right here I was

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:30.730 
the right hand side right here I was
thinking<00:04:29.210> but<00:04:30.050> then<00:04:30.170> I<00:04:30.260> was<00:04:30.380> like<00:04:30.440> where<00:04:30.710> is

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:30.740 
thinking but then I was like where is

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:32.380 
thinking but then I was like where is
that<00:04:30.980> because<00:04:31.100> if<00:04:31.400> you<00:04:31.490> see<00:04:31.730> the<00:04:31.940> map<00:04:32.150> he's

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:32.390 
that because if you see the map he's

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:33.790 
that because if you see the map he's
like<00:04:32.540> out<00:04:32.660> of<00:04:32.750> the<00:04:32.810> map<00:04:32.990> so<00:04:33.260> I<00:04:33.290> was<00:04:33.470> like<00:04:33.560> well<00:04:33.770> I

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:33.800 
like out of the map so I was like well I

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:36.040 
like out of the map so I was like well I
don't<00:04:33.890> know<00:04:34.040> what's<00:04:34.310> going<00:04:34.550> on<00:04:34.840> maybe<00:04:35.840> he

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:36.050 
don't know what's going on maybe he

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:38.020 
don't know what's going on maybe he
jumped<00:04:36.560> out<00:04:36.650> an<00:04:36.800> app<00:04:36.980> to<00:04:37.190> boost<00:04:37.430> and<00:04:37.730> if<00:04:37.910> you

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:38.030 
jumped out an app to boost and if you

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:40.270 
jumped out an app to boost and if you
saw<00:04:38.300> that<00:04:38.330> you<00:04:39.080> guys<00:04:39.470> might<00:04:39.680> have<00:04:39.860> to<00:04:39.950> rewind

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:40.280 
saw that you guys might have to rewind

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:41.860 
saw that you guys might have to rewind
that<00:04:40.460> look<00:04:40.730> on<00:04:40.820> the<00:04:41.000> mini-map<00:04:41.300> you<00:04:41.600> would<00:04:41.690> see

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:41.870 
that look on the mini-map you would see

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:43.600 
that look on the mini-map you would see
that<00:04:41.900> the<00:04:42.110> guy<00:04:42.230> was<00:04:42.260> out<00:04:42.500> of<00:04:42.530> the<00:04:42.650> map<00:04:42.800> I<00:04:43.100> don't

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:43.610

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:14.560 
since we have basically I think oh no
they<00:06:12.560> FC<00:06:12.830> I<00:06:13.310> figured<00:06:13.970> they'd<00:06:14.060> be<00:06:14.120> spawning<00:06:14.450> a

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:14.570 
they FC I figured they'd be spawning a

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:16.710 
they FC I figured they'd be spawning a
day<00:06:14.660> so<00:06:14.720> I<00:06:14.870> shot<00:06:15.410> that<00:06:15.440> javelin<00:06:15.800> up<00:06:15.980> over<00:06:16.160> there

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:16.720 
day so I shot that javelin up over there

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:18.240 
day so I shot that javelin up over there
and<00:06:16.870> get<00:06:17.080> a<00:06:17.110> double<00:06:17.350> right<00:06:17.710> there<00:06:17.920> as<00:06:18.010> you<00:06:18.100> can

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:18.250 
and get a double right there as you can

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:21.510 
and get a double right there as you can
see<00:06:18.460> and<00:06:19.080> I'm<00:06:20.080> gonna<00:06:20.290> just<00:06:20.800> kind<00:06:21.040> of<00:06:21.070> wait<00:06:21.400> it

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:21.520 
see and I'm gonna just kind of wait it

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:23.610 
see and I'm gonna just kind of wait it
out<00:06:21.640> it's<00:06:22.240> hard<00:06:22.420> when<00:06:22.690> we<00:06:22.870> have<00:06:23.050> just<00:06:23.380> the<00:06:23.500> be

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:23.620 
out it's hard when we have just the be

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:26.070 
out it's hard when we have just the be
flag<00:06:23.860> and<00:06:24.040> they<00:06:24.100> have<00:06:24.220> a<00:06:24.490> and<00:06:24.850> C<00:06:25.480> because<00:06:25.840> then

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:26.080 
flag and they have a and C because then

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:27.180 
flag and they have a and C because then
I<00:06:26.110> don't<00:06:26.200> really<00:06:26.470> know<00:06:26.680> what<00:06:26.860> these<00:06:26.950> guys<00:06:27.130> are
