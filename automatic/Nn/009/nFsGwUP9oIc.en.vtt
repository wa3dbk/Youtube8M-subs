 allows us to manage as a way of saving 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:39.040
 gasoline and good testing the by the

 streets of the peripheral city viaduct 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.830
 the truth is quite efficient the 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.260
 system 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:47.540
 in the back of what is the 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:51.800
 vehicle a vehicle of approximately 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:54.080
 5 meters long and two wide 2.5 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:55.910
 tons approximately the system 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:57.680
 entertainment as we had commented 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:59.660
 It has two form screens 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:02.750
 independent one for the second row 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:05.190
 of seats and another for the third both 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:07.410
 9 inch screens 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:09.210
 something very father who counts the second 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:11.310
 row of seats without having speakers in 

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:13.410
 the central part of the truck is that 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:14.550
 they have wireless headphones so that 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:16.800
 can hear what is being 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:18.120
 playing on the screens fits 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:20.520
 mention that as to the seats 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:22.560
 the second row and the third are 

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:24.780
 folding to gain much more space 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:26.730
 internal the second row is done in a 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:28.050
 manual while the third row 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:30.630
 It has a shape feature 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:33.390
 automatic and with very movements 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:35.940
 fun it's about the most 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:38.370
 equipped with the segment of this minivan the 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:40.980
 equipment limit with a price 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:43.260
 approximately 600 seats pesos 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:46.430
 They are lined in leather very well 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:49.980
 finished have armrests the 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:52.530
 four independent seats is one 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:54.660
 truck for seven passengers has a 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:57.300
 large capacity in the trunk of the back 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:59.700
 also approximately four suitcases 

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:01.140
 great and good to decide in the part 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:03.480
 from up here you can also use 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:04.870
 to put some small things or 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:06.879
 small suitcases 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:08.799
 to access the rear cabin what 

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:11.400
 we can do in two ways the 

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:11.400
 traditional 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:17.650
 or automatically through 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:17.650
 remote control 

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:28.840
 as we had mentioned the seats 

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:28.840
 they are animals are very easy to use 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:42.000
 You can also invite yourself by achieving greater 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:45.150
 space capacity just like the 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.960
 doors the trunk opens in two ways to 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:47.960
 through control 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:59.110
 It has the lever and we can take it 

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:59.110
 same 

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:14.440
 through these buttons we can fold 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:17.500
 the seats in the third row have 

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:20.560
 the mode to choose and both seats are 

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:22.630
 move at the same time or if we put 

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:25.270
 Fai moves only the seat of the 

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:27.490
 right we select led moves the 

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:29.590
 seat on the left we have several 

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:33.100
 configurations for the fold of the 

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:35.440
 seats one can be the mode 

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:37.570
 completely flat where we get 

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:39.580
 space from the second row of 

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:42.550
 seats until this part of here 

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:45.940
 we have this higher load capacity 

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:48.460
 that the other offers us if we select 

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:50.890
 this way the seats move 

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:53.790
 only towards the front there 

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:57.249
 we can occupy in this in this area 

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:58.929
 high volume spaces 

00:05:57.249 --> 00:06:01.389
 if you take the front of the block it would be 

00:05:58.929 --> 00:06:04.209
 behind the second row of seats a 

00:06:01.389 --> 00:06:06.899
 space not so high but if we take advantage 

00:06:04.209 --> 00:06:06.899
 employment 

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:12.370
 backs to occupy more that area of 

00:06:11.199 --> 00:06:15.820
 load 

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:18.040
 as a conclusion we can define that this 

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:20.620
 model is a great rival for the toyota 

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:22.690
 sienna and for heart honda odyssey account 

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:26.139
 with a very high level of equipment 

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:28.420
 complete very competitive very efficient 

00:06:26.139 --> 00:06:30.660
 It is super comfortable 

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:33.880
 bring what you need to go on a trip 

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:36.610
 comfortable safe with great capabilities 

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:38.260
 of travel computer space mode 

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:40.960
 energy saving 

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:42.280
 we can entertain the passengers of the 

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:44.800
 second and third row seeing one 

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:47.550
 movie I highly recommend this 

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:50.260
 vehicle is handled very father very soft 

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:51.970
 would have a small detail maybe not 

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:54.370
 It is as hermetic as its other two 

00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:57.610
 rivals but that does not make it less 

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:59.230
 no one takes an important factor 

00:06:57.610 --> 00:07:00.970
 decision making 

00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:02.950
 thank you very much friends autocosmos me
