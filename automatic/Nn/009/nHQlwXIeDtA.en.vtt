00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:07.670
 I came back with all the information of 

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:09.920
 the shows and we told him that the 

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:11.959
 boys from maroon five because they did not have or 

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:14.900
 they could not have better start of their 

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:16.789
 tour 2012 little man tremendous the 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:18.769
 concert that they offered last night here in 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:21.289
 the city â€‹â€‹of monterrey new lÃ©on 

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:23.679
 they left everyone breathless 

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:23.679
 present 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.660
 it follows this manufacturing rhythm that thousands 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.489
 of regiomontanos moved not as 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:43.180
 mick jagger or someone else but as 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:43.180
 they would like 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.190
 the Californian group rank with great 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.020
 success suggests our city where 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.120
 they achieved what few had achieved 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.770
 during the last months exhaust 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.110
 tickets in one of the more enclosures 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.579
 largest in Latin America with a 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:04.409
 visually modest production that 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.810
 consists of screens and a powerful game 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:10.009
 of lights for my company splurge the 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.009
 energy on stage 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:22.050
 although its effect towards the presence does not 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.370
 it was different from the one of his arrival that did not 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:25.500
 imported with the magic of maroon five 

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:27.240
 it consisted of his very talent that 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.030
 spell and gift a night that 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.720
 surely for many it still echoes in 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.720
 his head 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.960
 The polution 

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:58.200
 what if it's adam levine I really say 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.550
 I regret a lot because 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.890
 one thing or another I did not have the opportunity 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:03.240
 to buy tickets and then I imagine 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.490
 that a lot of people because they sold out 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.770
 immediately the tickets but hopefully 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:10.679
 come very soon because the psuv we saw 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:12.840
 many who with him outside sighed this was 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:14.840
 the main reason why many do not 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:17.280
 They were because tickets were sold out 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.440
 They must have made another easy date 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.510
 well to fill the precinct left is 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:24.270
 I wish I wish they come back 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:27.240
 soon soon oh yes changing 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:30.209
 topic today you a few days of death 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:32.250
 from chavela vargas the scandal has 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:34.290
 started there he commissioned them 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.480
 statements of some of their beings 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.610
 loved exactly and that is because the 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.770
 family blames the representative and 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:43.490
 biographer Maria curtain to be the 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:46.700
 guilty of the death of the shaman 

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:49.910
 I because he was so cruel to my family 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:52.190
 because he did not allow me to see my aunt 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:55.120
 what was the theme was that I would encourage 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:55.120
 my aunt as
