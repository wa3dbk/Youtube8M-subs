and show them inside the box is one

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:30.550 
and show them inside the box is one
prediction<00:00:29.340> in<00:00:29.610> one<00:00:29.730> prediction<00:00:30.090> only

prediction in one prediction only

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:34.819 
prediction in one prediction only
remember<00:00:31.560> they<00:00:31.680> chose<00:00:31.920> this<00:00:32.070> color<00:00:33.680> take<00:00:34.680> a

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
remember they chose this color take a

remember they chose this color take a
look<00:00:35.010> at<00:00:35.129> the<00:00:35.250> prediction<00:00:39.679> open<00:00:40.679> it<00:00:40.769> up<00:00:41.149> of

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
look at the prediction open it up of

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:47.569 
look at the prediction open it up of
course<00:00:42.920> you<00:00:43.920> will<00:00:44.730> pick<00:00:45.089> blue<00:00:46.280> you<00:00:47.280> know<00:00:47.370> they

different things held with a paper clip

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.010 
different things held with a paper clip
your<00:01:18.610> five<00:01:18.939> different<00:01:19.210> predictions<00:01:19.630> of<00:01:19.840> all

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:20.020 
your five different predictions of all

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.889 
your five different predictions of all
five<00:01:20.259> colors<00:01:20.970> inside<00:01:21.970> each<00:01:22.149> of<00:01:22.299> these<00:01:22.390> papers

00:01:22.889 --> 00:01:22.899 
five colors inside each of these papers

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:25.590 
five colors inside each of these papers
is<00:01:23.140> a<00:01:23.170> little<00:01:23.619> steel<00:01:24.610> magnet

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:25.600 
is a little steel magnet

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:30.300 
is a little steel magnet
alright<00:01:27.450> so<00:01:28.450> that's<00:01:28.720> it<00:01:28.929> you<00:01:29.470> put<00:01:29.679> this<00:01:29.830> on<00:01:30.039> top

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:30.310 
alright so that's it you put this on top

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:32.340 
alright so that's it you put this on top
you<00:01:31.119> have<00:01:31.149> the<00:01:31.330> expect<00:01:31.750> you<00:01:31.840> to<00:01:31.929> choose<00:01:32.140> any

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:32.350 
you have the expect you to choose any

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:34.260 
you have the expect you to choose any
color<00:01:32.619> and<00:01:33.340> I'll<00:01:33.490> show<00:01:33.670> you<00:01:33.729> what<00:01:33.940> happens

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:34.270 
color and I'll show you what happens

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:35.880 
color and I'll show you what happens
let's<00:01:34.420> say<00:01:34.509> they<00:01:34.690> choose<00:01:34.929> yellow<00:01:35.259> just<00:01:35.740> watch

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:35.890 
let's say they choose yellow just watch

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:39.899 
let's say they choose yellow just watch
the<00:01:36.069> box<00:01:36.869> and<00:01:37.869> the<00:01:38.140> prediction<00:01:38.709> falls<00:01:39.520> down

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:39.909 
the box and the prediction falls down

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:45.300 
the box and the prediction falls down
from<00:01:40.979> there<00:01:42.899> alright<00:01:43.899> so<00:01:44.649> the<00:01:44.799> prediction<00:01:45.130> is

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:45.310 
from there alright so the prediction is

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:47.870 
from there alright so the prediction is
held<00:01:45.840> by<00:01:46.840> a<00:01:46.869> magnet

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
held by a magnet

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.940 
held by a magnet
inside<00:01:48.880> the<00:01:49.060> paper<00:01:49.270> when<00:01:50.200> they<00:01:50.380> remove

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:50.950 
inside the paper when they remove

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:53.789 
inside the paper when they remove
whatever<00:01:51.490> color<00:01:52.030> they<00:01:52.209> want<00:01:52.420> a<00:01:52.780> magnet<00:01:53.649> is

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:53.799 
whatever color they want a magnet is

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:55.919 
whatever color they want a magnet is
released<00:01:54.189> dropping<00:01:55.149> the<00:01:55.269> prediction<00:01:55.720> and

00:01:55.919 --> 00:01:55.929 
released dropping the prediction and

00:01:55.929 --> 00:01:59.070 
released dropping the prediction and
only<00:01:56.500> the<00:01:56.619> prediction<00:01:57.039> in<00:01:57.280> the<00:01:57.940> box<00:01:58.119> what<00:01:58.959> the

00:01:59.070 --> 00:01:59.080 
only the prediction in the box what the

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:02.339 
only the prediction in the box what the
bedding<00:01:59.440> does<00:01:59.679> is<00:02:00.039> to<00:02:00.879> silence<00:02:01.450> the<00:02:02.080> paper

00:02:02.339 --> 00:02:02.349 
bedding does is to silence the paper

00:02:02.349 --> 00:02:04.440 
bedding does is to silence the paper
clip<00:02:02.619> from<00:02:02.769> hitting<00:02:02.950> the<00:02:03.310> bottom<00:02:04.119> of<00:02:04.209> the<00:02:04.269> box

you<00:02:04.929> don't<00:02:05.050> want<00:02:05.229> to<00:02:05.319> hear<00:02:05.729> that<00:02:06.729> so<00:02:07.090> you<00:02:07.149> lose

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:07.420 
you don't want to hear that so you lose

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:09.690 
you don't want to hear that so you lose
lose<00:02:07.690> a<00:02:07.720> little<00:02:07.959> use<00:02:08.739> a<00:02:09.069> little<00:02:09.369> bit<00:02:09.489> of<00:02:09.580> this

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700 
lose a little use a little bit of this

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:11.220 
lose a little use a little bit of this
bedding<00:02:09.940> to<00:02:10.179> silence<00:02:10.599> the<00:02:10.810> paper<00:02:10.989> clip

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
bedding to silence the paper clip

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.150 
bedding to silence the paper clip
falling<00:02:11.560> they<00:02:12.489> open<00:02:12.819> it<00:02:12.910> up<00:02:13.060> and<00:02:13.920> of<00:02:14.920> course

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
falling they open it up and of course

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.970 
falling they open it up and of course
they<00:02:15.849> picked<00:02:16.120> yellow<00:02:16.360> and<00:02:16.690> that's<00:02:17.650> what<00:02:17.860> the

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
they picked yellow and that's what the

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:21.989 
they picked yellow and that's what the
prediction<00:02:18.430> says<00:02:18.790> you<00:02:19.450> pick<00:02:19.690> you<00:02:19.959> up
