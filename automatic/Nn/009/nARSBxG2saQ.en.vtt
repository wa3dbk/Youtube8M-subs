eye<00:00:52.440> so<00:00:53.340> I'm<00:00:53.430> just<00:00:53.640> taking<00:00:54.140> like<00:00:55.140> I<00:00:55.260> said<00:00:55.320> a

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
eye so I'm just taking like I said a

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.160 
eye so I'm just taking like I said a
neutral<00:00:56.010> color<00:00:56.510> and<00:00:57.510> I'm<00:00:57.600> just<00:00:57.840> gently

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
neutral color and I'm just gently

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.779 
neutral color and I'm just gently
brushing<00:00:58.710> that<00:00:58.829> right<00:00:59.190> up<00:00:59.370> in<00:00:59.520> here<00:00:59.640> and

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
brushing that right up in here and

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.099 
brushing that right up in here and
that's<00:00:59.910> going<00:00:59.969> to<00:01:00.090> create<00:01:00.270> more<00:01:00.539> depth<00:01:00.840> so<00:01:00.989> it

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
that's going to create more depth so it

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.130 
that's going to create more depth so it
starts<00:01:01.550> it<00:01:02.550> starts<00:01:02.969> my<00:01:03.120> contouring<00:01:03.690> former

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
starts it starts my contouring former

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.660 
starts it starts my contouring former
using<00:01:04.439> shadow<00:01:04.739> in<00:01:05.040> here<00:01:05.220> you<00:01:05.339> see<00:01:05.519> how<00:01:05.580> it

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
using shadow in here you see how it

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.340 
using shadow in here you see how it
starts<00:01:06.000> to<00:01:06.060> narrow<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:06.630> nose<00:01:06.810> shape<00:01:07.170> a<00:01:07.320> little

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
starts to narrow the nose shape a little

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.630 
starts to narrow the nose shape a little
bit<00:01:08.960> just<00:01:09.960> like<00:01:10.260> that<00:01:10.560> and<00:01:10.830> it's<00:01:11.369> good<00:01:11.610> to

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
bit just like that and it's good to

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.780 
bit just like that and it's good to
start<00:01:11.970> down<00:01:12.150> here<00:01:12.180> and<00:01:12.479> brush<00:01:12.689> up<00:01:12.900> ok<00:01:13.470> so

highlight so basically all I want to do

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.890 
highlight so basically all I want to do
is<00:01:18.090> work<00:01:18.390> from<00:01:18.810> her<00:01:19.400> natural<00:01:20.400> brow<00:01:20.700> and<00:01:21.090> draw<00:01:21.869> a

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
straight line down and then blend so I'm

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.190 
straight line down and then blend so I'm
going<00:01:25.170> to<00:01:25.200> use<00:01:25.259> the<00:01:25.590> darkest<00:01:26.159> color<00:01:26.810> from<00:01:27.810> my

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
going to use the darkest color from my

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.859 
going to use the darkest color from my
corrector<00:01:28.799> wheel<00:01:29.009> to<00:01:30.000> do<00:01:30.180> this<00:01:30.390> and<00:01:30.600> this<00:01:30.689> may

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
corrector wheel to do this and this may

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.330 
corrector wheel to do this and this may
seem<00:01:30.930> a<00:01:31.110> little<00:01:31.320> scary<00:01:31.680> at<00:01:31.829> first<00:01:31.860> when<00:01:32.250> you

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
seem a little scary at first when you

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.770 
seem a little scary at first when you
first<00:01:32.579> do<00:01:32.700> this<00:01:32.880> on<00:01:33.030> yourself<00:01:33.390> but<00:01:33.509> the<00:01:33.600> more

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
first do this on yourself but the more

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.030 
first do this on yourself but the more
you<00:01:33.810> do<00:01:33.990> it<00:01:34.020> the<00:01:34.140> more<00:01:34.259> you'll<00:01:34.470> get<00:01:34.650> used<00:01:34.860> to<00:01:34.950> it

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
you do it the more you'll get used to it

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.240 
you do it the more you'll get used to it
so<00:01:35.820> I<00:01:35.850> start<00:01:36.240> right<00:01:36.570> here<00:01:36.600> right<00:01:37.560> at<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:37.799> tip

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
so I start right here right at the tip

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.319 
so I start right here right at the tip
of<00:01:38.310> the<00:01:38.490> eyebrow<00:01:38.939> and<00:01:39.240> I<00:01:40.020> start<00:01:40.380> to<00:01:40.560> brush<00:01:40.799> down

00:01:41.319 --> 00:01:41.329 
of the eyebrow and I start to brush down

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:44.420 
of the eyebrow and I start to brush down
and<00:01:42.329> I<00:01:42.420> make<00:01:42.600> this<00:01:42.750> as<00:01:42.960> round<00:01:43.860> it<00:01:44.130> and<00:01:44.159> it's

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
and I make this as round it and it's

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.010 
and I make this as round it and it's
perfect<00:01:44.820> as<00:01:44.939> possible<00:01:45.000> turn<00:01:45.630> towards<00:01:45.869> me<00:01:45.930> a

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
perfect as possible turn towards me a

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.050 
perfect as possible turn towards me a
little<00:01:46.110> bit<00:01:46.409> I<00:01:46.680> want<00:01:47.520> that<00:01:47.610> to<00:01:47.759> be<00:01:47.850> a<00:01:47.880> little

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
little bit I want that to be a little

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.469 
little bit I want that to be a little
more<00:01:48.180> rounded<00:01:48.810> shape<00:01:49.110> right<00:01:50.009> here<00:01:50.210> and<00:01:51.210> then

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
more rounded shape right here and then

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.429 
more rounded shape right here and then
I'm<00:01:51.630> going<00:01:51.780> to<00:01:51.840> go<00:01:52.140> as<00:01:52.439> straight<00:01:53.130> as<00:01:53.280> I<00:01:53.399> can

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:54.439 
I'm going to go as straight as I can

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:57.319 
I'm going to go as straight as I can
write<00:01:55.439> down<00:01:55.649> the<00:01:55.829> nose<00:01:56.009> with<00:01:56.310> it<00:01:56.460> so<00:01:57.000> you<00:01:57.060> see

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
write down the nose with it so you see

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.749 
write down the nose with it so you see
I'm<00:01:57.439> gently<00:01:58.439> trying<00:01:58.710> to<00:01:58.799> create<00:01:59.130> the<00:01:59.310> shape<00:01:59.549> I

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
I'm gently trying to create the shape I

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.290 
I'm gently trying to create the shape I
want

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:01.300 
want

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:04.080 
want
but<00:02:01.930> by<00:02:02.020> the<00:02:02.080> time<00:02:02.170> I<00:02:02.350> get<00:02:02.650> to<00:02:02.920> about<00:02:03.370> the<00:02:03.880> nose

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.090 
but by the time I get to about the nose
