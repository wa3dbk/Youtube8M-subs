00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
that um for sub see if he actually

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.750 
that um for sub see if he actually
switches<00:00:57.360> out<00:00:57.510> or<00:00:57.660> something<00:00:57.960> here<00:00:58.170> um

the screens has ended up actually

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.310 
the screens has ended up actually
switching<00:01:14.610> out<00:01:14.970> okay<00:01:15.420> so<00:01:15.479> that<00:01:15.780> worries<00:01:16.140> me<00:01:16.170> a

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320
