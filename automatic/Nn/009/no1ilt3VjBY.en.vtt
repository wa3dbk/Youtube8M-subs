KERMIT: Well, some people
say that you're the

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:32.664

would.

Let's see it.

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:41.780
Wow.

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:43.970

MR. TURTLE: Hm?

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:04.390
KERMIT: I was wondering.

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:06.890
Some people say that you're
too slow to win this race.

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:08.120
What do you say to
that, Turtle?

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:10.142

win this race?

00:01:10.142 --> 00:01:13.700

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:14.060

00:01:28.945 --> 00:01:30.220

Folks, let's go over and talk

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:11.076
Uh, pardon me, Mr. Rabbit.

00:02:11.076 --> 00:02:12.543
The turtle has already
moved out.

00:02:12.543 --> 00:02:14.031
He's running on down the
track, and you're just

00:02:14.031 --> 00:02:14.370
standing here.

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.812
Can you tell us exactly why
you're just standing here?

00:02:16.812 --> 00:02:18.740
MR. RABBIT: Hey, listen, I'm so
fast I can afford to just

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:21.830
hang around here for a while
and still win this race.

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:23.660
