towers shorter I try to make it into a

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.540 
towers shorter I try to make it into a
timeless<00:00:42.989> version<00:00:43.440> which<00:00:44.160> would<00:00:44.280> be<00:00:44.399> easier

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550

live so for a bit I have placed it down

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.210 
live so for a bit I have placed it down
underneath<00:01:45.540> the<00:01:45.720> stairs<00:01:46.560> yep

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
underneath the stairs yep

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.090 
underneath the stairs yep
this<00:01:47.490> will<00:01:47.670> save<00:01:47.790> some<00:01:48.000> space<00:01:48.329> for<00:01:48.780> us<00:01:49.079> but<00:01:49.979> if

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
this will save some space for us but if

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.319 
this will save some space for us but if
you<00:01:50.189> want<00:01:50.369> to<00:01:50.460> place<00:01:50.640> it<00:01:50.790> this<00:01:50.939> way<00:01:51.270> is

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329
