jealous elf to someone you're not and

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.380 
jealous elf to someone you're not and
you<00:02:10.500> can<00:02:10.739> kind<00:02:11.190> of<00:02:11.310> change<00:02:11.610> your<00:02:11.879> aims<00:02:12.120> and

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
you can kind of change your aims and

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.460 
you can kind of change your aims and
goals<00:02:12.450> so<00:02:12.959> you're<00:02:13.170> not

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
goals so you're not

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.770 
goals so you're not
but<00:02:13.710> at<00:02:14.430> the<00:02:14.610> end<00:02:14.640> of<00:02:14.790> the<00:02:14.910> day<00:02:15.030> sometimes<00:02:15.600> it

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
but at the end of the day sometimes it

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.710 
but at the end of the day sometimes it
can<00:02:15.990> really<00:02:16.230> suck<00:02:16.850> but<00:02:17.850> then<00:02:18.060> on<00:02:18.270> the<00:02:18.330> other

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
can really suck but then on the other

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.260 
can really suck but then on the other
side<00:02:19.530> of<00:02:19.560> the<00:02:19.680> coin<00:02:19.890> I'd<00:02:20.250> say<00:02:20.580> that<00:02:20.790> is<00:02:20.820> it<00:02:21.150> a

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
side of the coin I'd say that is it a

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:23.960 
side of the coin I'd say that is it a
necessary<00:02:22.110> evil<00:02:22.290> in<00:02:22.590> the<00:02:22.740> fact<00:02:22.950> that<00:02:23.070> that's

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
necessary evil in the fact that that's

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.900 
necessary evil in the fact that that's
what<00:02:24.240> I<00:02:24.420> will<00:02:24.570> a<00:02:24.600> lot<00:02:24.870> of<00:02:24.960> also<00:02:25.170> driven<00:02:25.410> by<00:02:25.910> you

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
what I will a lot of also driven by you

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:28.160 
what I will a lot of also driven by you
know<00:02:27.090> I<00:02:27.120> suppose<00:02:27.570> there's<00:02:27.810> a<00:02:27.870> difference

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
know I suppose there's a difference

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.650 
know I suppose there's a difference
between<00:02:28.200> envy<00:02:28.830> and<00:02:28.980> jealousy<00:02:29.240> but<00:02:30.240> at<00:02:30.510> the<00:02:30.630> end

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
between envy and jealousy but at the end

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.320 
between envy and jealousy but at the end
of<00:02:30.810> the<00:02:30.900> day<00:02:31.490> you<00:02:32.490> see<00:02:32.730> someone<00:02:33.000> doing

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
thinking about what it is exactly that

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:31.070 
thinking about what it is exactly that
you<00:03:28.830> can<00:03:29.160> you<00:03:29.550> can<00:03:29.730> learn<00:03:30.269> a<00:03:30.300> lot<00:03:30.480> just<00:03:30.870> by

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:31.080 
you can you can learn a lot just by

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:34.250 
you can you can learn a lot just by
thinking<00:03:31.140> about<00:03:31.739> things<00:03:32.160> and<00:03:32.459> I<00:03:33.150> reckon<00:03:34.080> with

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
thinking about things and I reckon with

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:35.930 
thinking about things and I reckon with
those<00:03:34.590> first<00:03:34.830> few<00:03:34.920> kills<00:03:35.160> this<00:03:35.340> is<00:03:35.459> where<00:03:35.640> I<00:03:35.670> go

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
those first few kills this is where I go

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:37.460 
those first few kills this is where I go
on<00:03:36.000> a<00:03:36.090> bit<00:03:36.269> of<00:03:36.300> a<00:03:36.450> nice<00:03:36.630> kilt<00:03:36.930> route<00:03:37.140> to<00:03:37.290> less

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
on a bit of a nice kilt route to less

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:39.410 
on a bit of a nice kilt route to less
