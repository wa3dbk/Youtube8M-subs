now if you don't do this correctly

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:41.089 
now if you don't do this correctly
meaning<00:02:38.459> you<00:02:38.700> most<00:02:38.940> likely<00:02:39.180> moved<00:02:39.920> the<00:02:40.920> rifle

00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:41.099 
meaning you most likely moved the rifle

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:44.030 
meaning you most likely moved the rifle
while<00:02:41.730> you<00:02:41.849> were<00:02:41.970> arranging<00:02:42.709> you<00:02:43.709> will<00:02:43.860> get<00:02:44.010> a

while you were arranging you will get a

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.770 
while you were arranging you will get a
no<00:02:44.340> shooting<00:02:45.000> solution<00:02:45.769> error<00:02:47.780> done

no shooting solution error done

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:53.089 
no shooting solution error done
correctly<00:02:49.290> and<00:02:49.769> it<00:02:50.340> will<00:02:50.519> pop<00:02:50.790> up<00:02:51.769> its<00:02:52.769> guards

00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:53.099 
correctly and it will pop up its guards

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:57.190 
correctly and it will pop up its guards
the<00:02:53.220> target<00:02:53.870> target<00:02:54.870> range<00:02:55.129> 263<00:02:56.129> yards<00:02:56.459> to<00:02:56.640> Bob

the crosshairs are at the bottom and

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:13.339 
the crosshairs are at the bottom and
then<00:03:11.459> we<00:03:11.579> just<00:03:11.760> hit<00:03:11.940> the<00:03:12.060> enter<00:03:12.269> button<00:03:12.390> and<00:03:12.870> it

00:03:13.339 --> 00:03:13.349 
then we just hit the enter button and it

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:23.780 
then we just hit the enter button and it
immediately<00:03:13.890> calculates<00:03:14.780> the<00:03:15.780> yardage<00:03:22.790> it's

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
immediately calculates the yardage it's

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:27.380 
immediately calculates the yardage it's
one<00:03:23.970> of<00:03:24.090> the<00:03:24.209> first<00:03:24.450> things<00:03:24.750> you<00:03:24.959> want<00:03:25.140> to<00:03:26.390> do

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:32.539 
one of the first things you want to do
when<00:03:27.720> you<00:03:27.840> get<00:03:28.019> it<00:03:29.239> is<00:03:30.239> zero<00:03:30.870> the<00:03:31.049> cartridge<00:03:31.549> so

00:03:32.539 --> 00:03:32.549 
when you get it is zero the cartridge so

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:37.339 
when you get it is zero the cartridge so

00:06:32.009 --> 00:06:35.869 
also calculates the angle which you
shoot<00:06:32.520> so<00:06:33.270> I<00:06:33.300> calculates<00:06:34.229> the<00:06:34.409> angle<00:06:34.620> up<00:06:35.550> and

00:06:35.869 --> 00:06:35.879 
shoot so I calculates the angle up and

00:06:35.879 --> 00:06:38.510 
shoot so I calculates the angle up and
down<00:06:36.090> and<00:06:36.620> plug<00:06:37.620> that<00:06:37.650> into<00:06:37.889> your<00:06:38.190> shooting

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:38.520 
down and plug that into your shooting

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:42.430 
down and plug that into your shooting
solution<00:06:38.789> as<00:06:39.060> well<00:06:39.889> okay<00:06:40.889> so<00:06:40.949> they<00:06:41.159> like<00:06:41.339> this

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:42.440 
solution as well okay so they like this

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:45.649 
solution as well okay so they like this
