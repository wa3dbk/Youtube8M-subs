00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:40.000

 the common human beings are we are here at 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.590

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:46.060

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.829
 thank the damn thankless because 

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:49.239
 usually these channels make me 

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:52.050
 see only the games instead us 

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:52.050
 let's make culture 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:58.510

 offer a pizza maybe we'll go back to 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:14.800
 however this blog makes sense in 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:19.000
 right reality we all have 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:20.979
 a sense everyone has never ever noticed 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.320
 but never in life 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:24.880
 this blog basically exists for 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:27.460
 let you see our city we have 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:30.220
 said to thank you for joining 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:32.110
 so massive per second 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:37.030
 those two channel on the server 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:39.009
 so we wanted to give you some 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:40.899
 explanations why many of you are 

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:42.610
 been a bit pedantic in asking 

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:44.610
 go on shit 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:47.050
 who now is always the shitty dog 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.039
 feel what a mess it is anyway 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:51.039
 many of you have asked us 

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:54.220
 repeatedly something yes yes yes how 

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:56.440
 let's choose between you youtuber 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:58.750
 which are the most promising ones for 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:02.170
 our sick minds and therefore those from 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:04.720
 sponsor and then we usually 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:06.520
 we travel on youtube no you also do it 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:09.429
 so why shouldn't we do it 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:12.790
 and therefore we sometimes hear the name 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:14.650
 of someone good then if you are 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:15.280
 doing quality and doing a good one 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:17.410
 work 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:20.620
 there is a good chance that you are 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:22.599
 in our black list obviously list 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.970
 black would have been would be the white list 

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:27.190
 but we also have a blacklist and it is 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:30.190
 a list made of all the people e 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:33.630
 fuchsia our name instead of black list is 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:36.190
 made up of people who come to ask us 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:37.750
 guys but it is not that we are sponsored by him 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:40.270
 we know we must not send a visa 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:42.940
 let's really send the same because 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:45.400
 otherwise he couldn't see mine you 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:48.340
 makes us test yours on the cock 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:50.110
 channel without even opening it wrong a 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:51.940
 do indeed like we have a list 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:53.950
 of the channels that convince us we have one 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:56.170
 list of channels we will never call 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:58.270
 and you sending us private messages 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:59.260
 looking for sponsorships returned to 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:01.629
 that category 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:04.090
 ok guys rather incorrect rather 

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:04.720

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:18.190

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:20.980
 that you come behave like people 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:25.090

00:03:55.270 --> 00:04:00.240
 she was in a wheelchair she took a 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:06.670
 plasma and is waiting 

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:08.020
 continues however from both we say that 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:09.580

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:38.770

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:42.669
 tell you that we are not possible ie 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:44.710
 all times to explain a door 

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:46.690
 because struggling a door he wanted 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:48.430

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:50.470

 Last blog, however, we wouldn't want you to 

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:11.260
 confuse this thing with something that 

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:13.390
