00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
was a totally different one on display

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.539 
was a totally different one on display
and<00:02:26.970> then<00:02:27.690> they<00:02:27.840> showed<00:02:28.319> more<00:02:28.890> recently<00:02:29.310> like

00:02:29.539 --> 00:02:29.549 
and then they showed more recently like

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:32.479 
and then they showed more recently like
a<00:02:29.610> few<00:02:29.879> weeks<00:02:30.000> back<00:02:30.860> packaging<00:02:31.860> shots<00:02:32.160> of<00:02:32.370> the

really<00:02:33.299> bulky<00:02:33.780> one<00:02:33.959> that<00:02:34.110> looked<00:02:34.290> terrible

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
really bulky one that looked terrible

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.119 
really bulky one that looked terrible
I'm<00:02:36.120> wrong<00:02:36.390> so<00:02:36.989> they<00:02:37.140> finally<00:02:37.470> guessed

00:02:38.119 --> 00:02:38.129 
I'm wrong so they finally guessed

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:40.880 
I'm wrong so they finally guessed
decided<00:02:38.970> to<00:02:39.209> use<00:02:39.569> this<00:02:39.810> one<00:02:39.870> I<00:02:40.349> don't<00:02:40.739> know

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
decided to use this one I don't know

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.610 
decided to use this one I don't know
what<00:02:41.069> they<00:02:41.250> really<00:02:41.519> did<00:02:41.670> the<00:02:41.849> other<00:02:42.000> two<00:02:42.540> but<00:02:43.379> I

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620

mean it looks really nice though in my
opinion<00:02:50.420> but<00:02:51.420> maybe<00:02:51.569> that's<00:02:51.810> just<00:02:51.930> me<00:02:52.110> because

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
opinion but maybe that's just me because

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.199 
opinion but maybe that's just me because

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:04.000 
doesn't come with any but there is a
little<00:03:01.109> catch<00:03:01.319> doom<00:03:01.590> he<00:03:02.579> does<00:03:02.819> have<00:03:03.030> removable

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
little catch doom he does have removable

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:07.009 
little catch doom he does have removable
arm<00:03:05.010> of<00:03:05.220> the<00:03:05.579> pieces<00:03:06.359> of<00:03:06.510> what<00:03:06.629> do<00:03:06.720> you<00:03:06.750> want<00:03:06.959> to

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:07.019 
arm of the pieces of what do you want to

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:10.089 
arm of the pieces of what do you want to
call<00:03:07.140> them<00:03:07.230> the<00:03:07.980> first<00:03:08.190> part<00:03:08.579> is<00:03:08.819> a<00:03:09.090> removable

00:03:10.089 --> 00:03:10.099 
call them the first part is a removable

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:14.330 
call them the first part is a removable
faceplate<00:03:11.099> but<00:03:11.400> you<00:03:11.489> can<00:03:11.609> see<00:03:11.790> they're<00:03:13.340> pretty

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
faceplate but you can see they're pretty

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.339 
faceplate but you can see they're pretty
cool<00:03:14.549> I<00:03:14.609> guess<00:03:15.000> I<00:03:15.269> mean<00:03:15.660> I<00:03:15.810> don't<00:03:15.870> really<00:03:16.049> see

00:03:16.339 --> 00:03:16.349 
cool I guess I mean I don't really see

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:18.080 
cool I guess I mean I don't really see
why<00:03:16.590> they<00:03:16.799> needed<00:03:17.040> to<00:03:17.250> include<00:03:17.639> that<00:03:17.819> because

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
why they needed to include that because

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:21.020 
why they needed to include that because
um<00:03:18.569> I<00:03:18.930> guess<00:03:19.859> they<00:03:20.010> just<00:03:20.040> wanted<00:03:20.220> to<00:03:20.519> do<00:03:20.849> that

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
um I guess they just wanted to do that

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:22.640 
um I guess they just wanted to do that
so<00:03:21.299> they<00:03:21.419> can<00:03:21.540> add<00:03:21.660> some<00:03:21.870> extra<00:03:22.169> Play<00:03:22.380> feature

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
so they can add some extra Play feature

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.949 
so they can add some extra Play feature
into<00:03:23.099> it<00:03:23.250> since<00:03:24.150> he<00:03:24.239> doesn't<00:03:24.540> come<00:03:24.660> up<00:03:24.690> any

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
into it since he doesn't come up any

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:28.309 
into it since he doesn't come up any
actual<00:03:25.380> real<00:03:25.590> accessories<00:03:26.250> but<00:03:27.239> in<00:03:28.079> the

00:03:28.309 --> 00:03:28.319 
actual real accessories but in the

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:31.009 
actual real accessories but in the
original<00:03:28.470> trilogy<00:03:28.919> you<00:03:29.310> never<00:03:29.579> saw<00:03:29.880> the<00:03:30.540> inner

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:31.019 
original trilogy you never saw the inner

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:32.960 
original trilogy you never saw the inner
parts<00:03:31.440> with<00:03:31.560> seat<00:03:31.739> their<00:03:31.919> view<00:03:32.099> other<00:03:32.669> than

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
parts with seat their view other than

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:35.870 
parts with seat their view other than
the<00:03:33.269> part<00:03:33.510> where<00:03:33.720> um<00:03:33.930> he<00:03:34.799> got<00:03:34.950> blasted<00:03:35.579> to

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
the part where um he got blasted to

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:38.120 
the part where um he got blasted to
pieces<00:03:35.910> and<00:03:36.450> the<00:03:36.750> Empire<00:03:36.989> Strikes<00:03:37.230> Back<00:03:37.410> and

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
pieces and the Empire Strikes Back and

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:39.650 
pieces and the Empire Strikes Back and
all<00:03:38.250> as<00:03:38.340> you<00:03:38.430> can<00:03:38.579> see<00:03:38.730> was<00:03:38.940> like<00:03:39.150> some<00:03:39.389> cutoff

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660 
all as you can see was like some cutoff

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:41.569 
all as you can see was like some cutoff
pieces<00:03:40.139> of<00:03:40.290> him<00:03:40.410> but<00:03:41.010> you<00:03:41.160> didn't<00:03:41.400> actually

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:41.579 
pieces of him but you didn't actually

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:44.750 
pieces of him but you didn't actually
see<00:03:41.970> the<00:03:42.090> inside<00:03:42.540> of<00:03:42.569> c-3po<00:03:43.260> so<00:03:43.950> that's<00:03:44.519> a

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
see the inside of c-3po so that's a

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.699 
see the inside of c-3po so that's a
really<00:03:44.940> kind<00:03:45.299> of<00:03:45.329> flaw<00:03:45.750> since<00:03:46.079> this<00:03:46.230> is<00:03:46.440> the

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 
really kind of flaw since this is the

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:50.059 
really kind of flaw since this is the
vintage<00:03:47.040> collection<00:03:47.700> line<00:03:48.739> for<00:03:49.739> the<00:03:49.829> Empire

00:03:50.059 --> 00:03:50.069 
vintage collection line for the Empire

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:50.770 
vintage collection line for the Empire
Strikes<00:03:50.250> Back

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:50.780 
Strikes Back

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:52.909 
Strikes Back
so<00:03:51.780> I<00:03:51.810> don't<00:03:52.139> know<00:03:52.200> why<00:03:52.319> they<00:03:52.440> did<00:03:52.590> that<00:03:52.620> but

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:52.919 
so I don't know why they did that but

00:03:52.919 --> 00:03:54.650 
so I don't know why they did that but
whatever<00:03:53.579> it's<00:03:54.000> still<00:03:54.209> pretty<00:03:54.359> neat<00:03:54.630> though

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660 
whatever it's still pretty neat though

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:56.330 
whatever it's still pretty neat though
they<00:03:54.989> had<00:03:55.109> some<00:03:55.290> nice<00:03:55.440> details<00:03:56.069> in<00:03:56.220> their

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 
they had some nice details in their

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:58.520 
they had some nice details in their
wires<00:03:56.730> his<00:03:57.120> eyes<00:03:57.329> and<00:03:57.630> everything<00:03:57.840> he<00:03:58.380> was

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:00.710 
wires his eyes and everything he was
chests<00:03:58.829> but<00:03:59.010> I<00:03:59.190> mean<00:03:59.459> his<00:03:59.579> face<00:03:59.760> play<00:04:00.000> even<00:04:00.239> if

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:04.190 
chests but I mean his face play even if
it's<00:04:00.870> on<00:04:01.049> pretty<00:04:01.230> nicely<00:04:01.609> works<00:04:02.609> out<00:04:02.790> well

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200 
it's on pretty nicely works out well

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.800

camera now but other than that it's
really<00:05:51.520> nice<00:05:51.640> figure<00:05:51.910> I'll<00:05:52.480> give<00:05:52.750> him<00:05:52.960> a<00:05:53.610> 4.5

really nice figure I'll give him a 4.5
out<00:05:54.850> of<00:05:54.880> 5<00:05:55.000> the<00:05:55.720> only<00:05:55.960> reason<00:05:56.320> I<00:05:56.410> give<00:05:56.590> him<00:05:56.680> that

00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:56.740 
out of 5 the only reason I give him that

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:00.090 
out of 5 the only reason I give him that
is<00:05:57.010> because<00:05:57.340> he<00:05:57.720> he<00:05:58.720> has<00:05:58.960> the<00:05:59.110> removable<00:05:59.560> armor

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:00.100 
is because he he has the removable armor

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:02.340 
is because he he has the removable armor
pieces<00:06:00.340> that<00:06:01.150> wasn't<00:06:01.510> really<00:06:01.630> shown<00:06:02.050> in<00:06:02.260> the
