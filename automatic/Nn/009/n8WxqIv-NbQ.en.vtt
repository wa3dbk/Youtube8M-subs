00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
the front lacing here is merely

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.999 
the front lacing here is merely
decorative<00:01:47.850> on<00:01:48.270> this<00:01:48.810> side<00:01:49.020> it's<00:01:49.380> closed<00:01:49.709> and

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
decorative on this side it's closed and

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.400 
decorative on this side it's closed and
it<00:01:50.250> just<00:01:50.459> has<00:01:50.700> a<00:01:51.000> bone<00:01:51.179> on<00:01:51.479> the<00:01:51.599> scene<00:01:51.810> here<00:01:51.990> so

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:52.410 
it just has a bone on the scene here so

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:54.680 
it just has a bone on the scene here so
because<00:01:52.590> the<00:01:53.069> zipper<00:01:53.399> actually<00:01:53.880> replaces<00:01:54.509> the

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:54.690 
because the zipper actually replaces the

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:57.440 
because the zipper actually replaces the
bone<00:01:54.869> on<00:01:55.200> one<00:01:55.649> of<00:01:55.770> the<00:01:55.860> seams<00:01:56.160> it<00:01:56.459> is<00:01:57.030> a<00:01:57.060> little

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
bone on one of the seams it is a little

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.540 
bone on one of the seams it is a little
bit<00:01:57.599> less<00:01:57.780> structured<00:01:58.319> on<00:01:58.590> this<00:01:58.830> side<00:01:59.069> and<00:01:59.340> so

00:01:59.540 --> 00:01:59.550 
bit less structured on this side and so

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:01.880 
bit less structured on this side and so
it<00:01:59.759> tends<00:02:00.060> to<00:02:00.179> bent<00:02:00.509> in<00:02:00.750> at<00:02:01.259> the<00:02:01.470> waist<00:02:01.649> a

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
it tends to bent in at the waist a

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.469 
it tends to bent in at the waist a
little<00:02:02.009> bit<00:02:02.250> more<00:02:02.399> so<00:02:02.580> I'm<00:02:02.700> curvier<00:02:03.119> on<00:02:03.270> this

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
little bit more so I'm curvier on this

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.089 
little bit more so I'm curvier on this
side<00:02:03.660> than<00:02:03.840> i<00:02:03.869> actually<00:02:04.080> am<00:02:04.319> on<00:02:04.530> this<00:02:04.709> side<00:02:04.890> so

00:02:05.089 --> 00:02:05.099 
side than i actually am on this side so

00:02:05.099 --> 00:02:07.219 
side than i actually am on this side so
here's<00:02:05.490> the<00:02:05.610> iud<00:02:05.940> underbust<00:02:06.270> laying<00:02:06.569> flat<00:02:06.899> and

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
here's the iud underbust laying flat and

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:08.660 
here's the iud underbust laying flat and
the<00:02:07.410> main<00:02:07.560> reason<00:02:07.800> that<00:02:07.830> I<00:02:07.950> wanted<00:02:08.039> to<00:02:08.340> try

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
the main reason that I wanted to try

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.059 
the main reason that I wanted to try
this<00:02:08.729> particular<00:02:09.479> corset<00:02:10.020> was<00:02:10.200> due<00:02:10.619> to<00:02:10.830> the

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
this particular corset was due to the

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.670 
this particular corset was due to the
zip<00:02:11.310> closure<00:02:11.760> in<00:02:12.030> the<00:02:12.209> side<00:02:12.450> back<00:02:12.780> here<00:02:13.140> I<00:02:13.290> have

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
zip closure in the side back here I have

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.170 
zip closure in the side back here I have
relatively<00:02:14.130> little<00:02:14.340> experience<00:02:14.580> with

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
relatively little experience with

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.330 
relatively little experience with
corsets<00:02:15.840> that<00:02:15.959> have<00:02:16.170> zip<00:02:16.530> closures<00:02:17.010> I<00:02:17.160> only

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
corsets that have zip closures I only

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.180 
corsets that have zip closures I only
tried<00:02:17.940> to<00:02:18.540> before<00:02:18.930> this<00:02:19.110> one<00:02:19.319> and<00:02:19.560> it's

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
tried to before this one and it's

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:21.589 
tried to before this one and it's
interesting<00:02:20.459> to<00:02:20.730> see<00:02:20.940> the<00:02:21.150> differences<00:02:21.540> in

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:21.599 
interesting to see the differences in

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:23.900 
interesting to see the differences in
how<00:02:21.840> they<00:02:22.050> actually<00:02:22.290> insert<00:02:23.190> the<00:02:23.340> zipper<00:02:23.640> and

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
how they actually insert the zipper and

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:25.490 
how they actually insert the zipper and
whether<00:02:24.150> it<00:02:24.360> stands<00:02:24.569> up<00:02:24.750> to<00:02:24.840> tension<00:02:25.230> or<00:02:25.349> not

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
whether it stands up to tension or not

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.559 
whether it stands up to tension or not
now<00:02:26.010> this<00:02:26.220> one<00:02:26.430> actually<00:02:26.640> does<00:02:27.000> stand<00:02:27.300> up<00:02:27.450> to

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569 
now this one actually does stand up to

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:29.780 
now this one actually does stand up to
about<00:02:27.750> four<00:02:28.050> inches<00:02:28.319> reduction<00:02:28.890> I<00:02:29.040> think<00:02:29.610> this

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
about four inches reduction I think this

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.100 
about four inches reduction I think this
corset<00:02:30.630> is<00:02:30.780> marketed<00:02:31.349> to<00:02:31.530> people<00:02:31.950> who<00:02:32.130> are

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 
corset is marketed to people who are

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:36.890 
corset is marketed to people who are
dancers<00:02:34.110> in<00:02:34.800> burlesque<00:02:35.310> so<00:02:35.819> they<00:02:36.030> can<00:02:36.330> have<00:02:36.569> a

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
dancers in burlesque so they can have a

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.650 
dancers in burlesque so they can have a
really<00:02:37.380> easy<00:02:37.500> out<00:02:37.800> from<00:02:38.400> their<00:02:38.520> corset<00:02:38.940> but<00:02:39.510> in

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
really easy out from their corset but in

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.479 
really easy out from their corset but in
any<00:02:39.780> case<00:02:39.870> for<00:02:40.200> the<00:02:40.290> materials<00:02:40.709> of<00:02:40.860> this<00:02:41.040> it<00:02:41.280> I

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
any case for the materials of this it I

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:43.550 
any case for the materials of this it I
believe<00:02:41.760> it's<00:02:41.939> two<00:02:42.150> main<00:02:42.420> layers<00:02:42.719> it<00:02:43.019> has<00:02:43.200> the

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
believe it's two main layers it has the

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.440 
believe it's two main layers it has the
ivory<00:02:43.920> satin<00:02:44.069> on<00:02:44.340> the<00:02:44.370> outside<00:02:44.489> although<00:02:45.390> you

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
ivory satin on the outside although you

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:46.490 
ivory satin on the outside although you
can<00:02:45.780> get<00:02:45.989> it<00:02:46.110> in<00:02:46.200> red

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
can get it in red

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.800 
can get it in red
if<00:02:46.620> you<00:02:46.770> want<00:02:47.010> to<00:02:47.250> and<00:02:47.460> then<00:02:48.360> on<00:02:48.540> the<00:02:48.660> inside

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
if you want to and then on the inside

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.750 
if you want to and then on the inside
here<00:02:49.230> you<00:02:49.320> can<00:02:49.470> see<00:02:49.620> that<00:02:49.800> it's<00:02:49.980> also<00:02:50.220> lined<00:02:50.580> in

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
here you can see that it's also lined in

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.970 
here you can see that it's also lined in
ivory<00:02:51.180> 12<00:02:51.600> for<00:02:52.200> the<00:02:52.230> construction<00:02:52.470> of<00:02:52.830> this

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
ivory 12 for the construction of this

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:54.800 
ivory 12 for the construction of this
course<00:02:53.190> it<00:02:53.340> is<00:02:53.430> actually<00:02:53.880> made<00:02:54.060> from<00:02:54.090> a<00:02:54.360> 13

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
course it is actually made from a 13

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:56.990 
course it is actually made from a 13
panel<00:02:55.200> pattern<00:02:55.680> now<00:02:56.100> it's<00:02:56.310> kind<00:02:56.700> of<00:02:56.790> difficult

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
panel pattern now it's kind of difficult

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.210 
panel pattern now it's kind of difficult
to<00:02:57.300> see<00:02:57.630> where<00:02:58.050> it<00:02:58.230> starts<00:02:58.590> and<00:02:58.710> where<00:02:58.770> it<00:02:58.980> ends

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
to see where it starts and where it ends

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:00.890 
to see where it starts and where it ends
but<00:02:59.580> basically<00:02:59.910> this<00:03:00.120> is<00:03:00.180> a<00:03:00.300> center<00:03:00.690> front

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
but basically this is a center front

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.540 
but basically this is a center front
here<00:03:01.230> and<00:03:01.440> because<00:03:01.680> it<00:03:01.770> has<00:03:01.890> a<00:03:01.920> closed<00:03:02.250> front

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:02.550 
here and because it has a closed front

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:04.400 
here and because it has a closed front
then<00:03:02.760> it's<00:03:02.910> a<00:03:03.000> single<00:03:03.420> panel<00:03:03.780> right<00:03:03.959> there<00:03:04.200> and

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
then it's a single panel right there and

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:07.220 
then it's a single panel right there and
then<00:03:05.280> after<00:03:05.790> that<00:03:05.820> you<00:03:06.240> have<00:03:06.480> another<00:03:06.930> six

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
then after that you have another six

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:08.990 
then after that you have another six
panels<00:03:07.680> on<00:03:07.830> each<00:03:07.860> side<00:03:08.250> so<00:03:08.430> you<00:03:08.459> can<00:03:08.520> see<00:03:08.760> one

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
panels on each side so you can see one

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.590 
panels on each side so you can see one
two<00:03:09.480> three<00:03:10.080> four<00:03:10.440> five<00:03:10.500> six<00:03:11.070> and<00:03:11.850> that<00:03:12.450> brings

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:12.600 
two three four five six and that brings

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.360 
two three four five six and that brings
you<00:03:12.810> to<00:03:12.959> the<00:03:13.050> lacing<00:03:13.410> panel<00:03:13.709> and<00:03:13.860> for<00:03:14.280> the

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
you to the lacing panel and for the

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.640 
you to the lacing panel and for the
actual<00:03:14.640> assembly<00:03:15.000> of<00:03:15.270> this<00:03:15.420> corset<00:03:15.900> it<00:03:16.140> seems

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
actual assembly of this corset it seems

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:18.410 
actual assembly of this corset it seems
as<00:03:16.890> though<00:03:16.920> the<00:03:17.520> fashion<00:03:17.910> fabric<00:03:18.209> and<00:03:18.330> the

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
as though the fashion fabric and the

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.420 
as though the fashion fabric and the
lining<00:03:18.750> or<00:03:18.840> flat<00:03:19.080> line<00:03:19.260> together<00:03:19.440> and<00:03:19.860> the

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
lining or flat line together and the

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.280 
lining or flat line together and the
panels<00:03:20.760> were<00:03:20.850> assembled<00:03:21.330> using<00:03:21.600> a<00:03:21.810> top<00:03:22.020> stitch

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
panels were assembled using a top stitch

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:23.990 
panels were assembled using a top stitch
so<00:03:22.530> it<00:03:22.680> is<00:03:22.800> at<00:03:23.040> least<00:03:23.340> double<00:03:23.610> stitched

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
so it is at least double stitched

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.010 
so it is at least double stitched
between<00:03:24.570> the<00:03:25.340> seams<00:03:26.340> here<00:03:26.640> the<00:03:27.450> boning<00:03:27.840> is

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:28.020 
between the seams here the boning is

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:31.370 
between the seams here the boning is
actually<00:03:28.950> in<00:03:29.120> internal<00:03:30.120> 12<00:03:30.570> boning<00:03:30.959> channels

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380 
actually in internal 12 boning channels

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:33.860 
actually in internal 12 boning channels
laid<00:03:31.830> on<00:03:32.100> the<00:03:32.280> seams<00:03:32.520> so<00:03:33.060> it's<00:03:33.180> single<00:03:33.510> bone<00:03:33.660> on

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
laid on the seams so it's single bone on

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:35.870 
laid on the seams so it's single bone on
the<00:03:33.900> seams<00:03:34.230> here<00:03:34.470> the<00:03:34.920> center<00:03:35.250> front<00:03:35.459> here

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880

corset here's a close-up of the binding

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:58.940 
corset here's a close-up of the binding
and<00:03:57.630> it's<00:03:57.780> made<00:03:57.930> from<00:03:58.080> this<00:03:58.290> commercial<00:03:58.560> black

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:58.950 
and it's made from this commercial black

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:00.979 
and it's made from this commercial black
ribbon<00:03:59.370> so<00:03:59.580> it's<00:03:59.790> not<00:03:59.940> folded<00:04:00.390> under<00:04:00.690> and<00:04:00.870> then

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:00.989 
ribbon so it's not folded under and then

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:02.600 
ribbon so it's not folded under and then
stitched<00:04:01.320> because<00:04:02.070> the<00:04:02.220> ribbon<00:04:02.489> itself

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:02.610 
stitched because the ribbon itself

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:05.030 
stitched because the ribbon itself
already<00:04:03.060> has<00:04:03.510> a<00:04:03.540> finished<00:04:04.140> edge<00:04:04.260> that<00:04:04.709> is<00:04:04.860> not

already has a finished edge that is not
going<00:04:05.250> to<00:04:05.370> fray<00:04:05.700> so<00:04:06.150> it<00:04:06.390> is<00:04:06.480> actually<00:04:06.690> a<00:04:06.930> single

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:07.380 
going to fray so it is actually a single

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:09.140 
going to fray so it is actually a single
line<00:04:07.590> of<00:04:07.620> machine<00:04:08.250> stitching<00:04:08.580> that's

line of machine stitching that's

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.600 
line of machine stitching that's
securing<00:04:09.600> it<00:04:09.720> down<00:04:09.900> on<00:04:10.170> the<00:04:10.470> outside<00:04:10.500> and<00:04:11.100> on

securing it down on the outside and on
the<00:04:11.670> underside<00:04:12.239> but<00:04:12.870> it's<00:04:13.110> fairly<00:04:13.470> neat<00:04:13.890> the

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 
the underside but it's fairly neat the

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:16.620 
modesty panel is unsafe int and it's

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:18.800

inches long and it has metal teeth which
in<00:04:44.430> my<00:04:44.729> opinion<00:04:44.880> is<00:04:45.419> a<00:04:45.960> bit<00:04:46.169> stronger<00:04:46.530> than<00:04:46.740> the

in my opinion is a bit stronger than the
nylon<00:04:47.370> this<00:04:48.360> is<00:04:48.540> not<00:04:48.690> a<00:04:48.720> YKK<00:04:48.990> zipper<00:04:49.650> it<00:04:49.770> says

nylon this is not a YKK zipper it says

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:51.830 
nylon this is not a YKK zipper it says
RiRi<00:04:50.430> on<00:04:50.580> it<00:04:50.729> so<00:04:50.910> I'm<00:04:51.120> assuming<00:04:51.240> that's<00:04:51.660> a

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:51.840 
RiRi on it so I'm assuming that's a

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:53.810 
RiRi on it so I'm assuming that's a
different<00:04:52.169> brand<00:04:52.470> here<00:04:52.770> but<00:04:53.250> it<00:04:53.400> seems<00:04:53.520> to<00:04:53.700> be

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:53.820 
different brand here but it seems to be

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:57.560 
different brand here but it seems to be
holding<00:04:54.060> in<00:04:54.360> fairly<00:04:54.870> well<00:04:55.250> this<00:04:56.250> is<00:04:56.760> secured

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:57.570 
holding in fairly well this is secured

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:59.550 
holding in fairly well this is secured
in<00:04:57.750> with<00:04:58.080> what<00:04:58.620> looks<00:04:58.800> like<00:04:58.860> a<00:04:58.979> single

00:04:59.550 --> 00:04:59.560 
in with what looks like a single

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:01.350 
in with what looks like a single
a<00:04:59.590> stitching<00:05:00.010> but<00:05:00.340> it<00:05:00.730> might<00:05:00.880> actually<00:05:01.060> be

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:01.360 
a stitching but it might actually be

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:03.450 
a stitching but it might actually be
lockstitch<00:05:02.169> so<00:05:02.410> it<00:05:02.530> might<00:05:02.710> be<00:05:02.740> stitched<00:05:03.130> twice

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:03.460 
lockstitch so it might be stitched twice

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:05.640 
lockstitch so it might be stitched twice
it<00:05:03.700> is<00:05:04.120> not<00:05:04.300> supported<00:05:04.990> by<00:05:05.020> any<00:05:05.139> bone

it is not supported by any bone

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:08.400 
it is not supported by any bone
underneath<00:05:06.220> here<00:05:06.639> so<00:05:06.940> like<00:05:07.300> I<00:05:07.419> said<00:05:07.480> before<00:05:07.900> it

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:08.410 
underneath here so like I said before it

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:11.190 
underneath here so like I said before it
is<00:05:08.470> a<00:05:08.650> bit<00:05:08.889> flexible<00:05:09.100> and<00:05:09.580> it<00:05:09.730> tends<00:05:10.240> to<00:05:10.330> go<00:05:10.990> in

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:11.200 
is a bit flexible and it tends to go in

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:13.350 
is a bit flexible and it tends to go in
a<00:05:11.230> little<00:05:11.620> bit<00:05:11.889> when<00:05:12.310> you're<00:05:12.490> wearing<00:05:12.730> it<00:05:13.000> so<00:05:13.330> I
