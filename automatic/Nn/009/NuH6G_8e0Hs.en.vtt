00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:26.519
 stay long because planting a product 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.039
 If you do not run to dinner, the other one. 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.619
 before one ends you will be without 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:35.040
 the products for example sometimes these 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:38.129
 potato that they even desire is so good that 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.230
 take away if I have space to plant another 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:43.140
 Shoot is if I'm going to be without 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.090
 so we have to get the branch of this 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.670
 enjoy the seedlings already planted in 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.860
 another space to contaminate a rate of 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:53.820
 other chives 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:56.730
 I can also at the fair new fair 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.390

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.960
 they 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:03.570
 I bring what I plant and really have a 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.409
 beautiful a great safe in terms of 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.340
 chemistry as we are talking about is really 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:10.560
 she 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.210
 it comes with chemistry to and then the part 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.570
 where you plant two or three times the 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.549
 same onion and will install as well and will 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:21.270
 grow organic onion too 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:23.549
 there's never going to be any on earth to 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.490
 chives when we plant it 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:28.470
 changes comes out we plant it and 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.270
 She does not go anybody until then she already 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.460
 free of pesticides 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:35.400
 from the moment we get out 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.710
 third muse of the own chives 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:54.240
 She is already the year. 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:56.740
 [Music] 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:59.259
 we participate in the association of 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:02.439
 farmers of sÃ£o mateus da feira 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:05.289
 language products without pesticides 

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:07.869
 I started planting without pesticides. 

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:10.840
 Because I bought some leaves 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:13.090
 at the fair to make treater juice 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:16.569
 and we are in the world already 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:18.879
 it seemed like it was getting worse 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:21.010
 Then I went into a garden of the Lord that 

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:23.799
 plant without pesticides and started 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:26.290
 take the juice from the cob and then I started to 

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:29.140
 feel good and there was one of the discoverers 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:31.720
 poison they put in the leaves in the 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:34.989
 vegetables we buy is nothing 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:37.390
 cool for health I did not hockey 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:40.030
 I want to know and not even talk about poison. 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:42.190
 inside my plantation because this 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:44.980
 is not good for my health or for 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:48.370
 the health of the human being in general 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:55.620
 I plant six different kinds of opash 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:03:04.230
 zucchini garlic sauce parsley salt 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:07.060
 beetroot broccoli ninja covo 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:11.889

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:15.400
 here only of the more we since then worse eh 

00:03:11.889 --> 00:03:17.500

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:21.819
 Can someone john to work a 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:24.760
 Good day to you and still have the 

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:28.540
 traveling can not come and people who 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:29.799
 really taking care of tomorrow 's study is 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:33.010
 very laborious 

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:35.829
 You have to be because you have talent and 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:38.859
 left a little without hesitation because the 

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:41.290
 I'll take care of the leash, I lost the bed. 

00:03:38.859 --> 00:03:44.440
 table and bath door in door 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:46.720
 taking this bus here this law 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:48.160
 I ended up getting a lot of my arm from 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.819
 both carry weight 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:53.709
 that's where I took the gardening course 

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:56.139
 I met a person who was already 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:58.870
 within the farmers' association and 

00:03:56.139 --> 00:04:02.260
 I found it interesting there when I 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:03.750
 I joined the association three years after 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:06.900
 get to win this team 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:12.000
 the ac but before going out on selling 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:14.160
 Bed Bath door table and would have everything 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:20.100
 who imagined perhaps in and really 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:23.880
 it's a service that's a lot of attention but it's 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:27.120
 a work that works with a 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:29.670
 heart itself and is practically one 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:33.120
 therapy for those who really like it 

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:36.660
 therapy is planting to retain 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:41.449
 this wonderful
