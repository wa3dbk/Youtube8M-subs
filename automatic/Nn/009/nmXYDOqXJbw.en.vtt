00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.810
 in mac os xx there is the autostart 

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:09.599
 as well as under windows also the 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:12.389
 autostart basically means that if 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:15.450
 my system will start right away 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:19.020
 one or the other application with the 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:23.390
 system is started automatically 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:26.310
 There are two options under mac os 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:30.090
 to stop this autostadt 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:33.149
 on the one hand, it is the fast solution 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:37.260
 simple solution that works over 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:40.800
 our pressure and on the other hand it is the 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:43.860
 Solution that works over ours 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.860
 Control Panel want both solutions 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:49.680
 we discuss in this workshop 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:52.949
 First time we go to the solution over 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:55.440
 the dock on the dock below that looks yes 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:59.039
 I have my programs in there I 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:02.399
 most users and would like to 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:05.510
 example that my address book or my 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:07.710
 skype again at the beginning already said 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:11.189
 automatically start with 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:15.780
 So I click on the symbol 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:17.880
 right mouse button go to options and 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.619
 Here you will find the point in the 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:23.310
 open registration 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:27.290
 that means when max is started you 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:30.479
 you in the system logs or the 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:33.409
 logon process 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:37.200
 Skype immediately afterwards 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:39.720
 This is the quick solution 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.880
 but as we said at the beginning 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.829
 There is also something more complex 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.200
 solution and we will now as 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:47.310
 to discuss next 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:50.930
 First of all, he goes up or up 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.909
 Apple logo in the system settings 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:55.619
 to get 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:59.310
 there in the system settings you have 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:01.890
 the user to the user you have 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:04.860
 Here and there you have the tab on the right 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:08.429
 login objects so you click on 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:11.400
 login objects and see here is mine 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:13.790
 skype entered skype will be so 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:17.299
 hereby my system 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:20.120
 Together, the ah started this is a 

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:22.219
 program and left you can see 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:25.159
 what you click can hide it 

00:02:22.219 --> 00:02:26.239
 that means instead of your program 

00:02:25.159 --> 00:02:28.099
 you have just with the 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:31.340
 system settings seen kopton 

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:33.079
 he might not want to open the window 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:35.450
 Although we have indeed started it 

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:38.239
 but will not this window with 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:39.079
 then you clicked on this here 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:40.760
 is started 

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:43.459
 you see that down in your blog 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:46.069
 program is started but it is not 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:47.750
 window on the desktop now there is 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:50.239
 Another step we took 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:51.290
 if we have an autostart 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:54.560
 carry out 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:57.560
 in another tutorial we have 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:03:01.299
 already talked about what spaces are 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:02.510
 and that we can take by car 

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:04.879
 combine 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:08.569
 that means we are going to the 

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:11.060
 Settings exposé and spaces go 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:14.930
 there on spaces and you have down now 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:17.450
 a list where programs are listed 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:19.970
 that means those programs will be in 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:23.299
 a particular screen in one 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:25.280
 space in a desktop started on 

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:27.919
 a test system you see I have four 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:34.250
 spaces and would like to work in 

00:03:27.919 --> 00:03:35.449
 future the skype in my space number 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:37.519
 1 is started 

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:40.940
 So I want it again 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:43.479
 show up here then clicked on plus 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:46.609
 on select gone 

00:03:43.479 --> 00:03:47.870
 because the program what you want to start 

00:03:46.609 --> 00:03:50.419
 is not in the list here 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:52.280
 why are you reading this ? 

00:03:50.419 --> 00:03:53.269
 was only for programs that already 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:55.549
 started 

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:58.430
 but that does not matter we get as 

00:03:55.549 --> 00:04:01.030
 left on programs crowns down 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:07.159
 until we find skype 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:10.099
 lmnop here is skype add 

00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:15.739
 and skype i would like to have it in 

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:17.840
 space 1 is started that means mco 

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:22.250
 Sixx is started I log in 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:25.130
 the jump to workstation 1 opens 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:26.680
 skype and then go on in my 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:30.759
 Example you see I have 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:34.960
 the us in space 3 means that he jumps 

00:04:30.759 --> 00:04:37.900
 only on space 3 opens itunes jumps 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:40.330
 next of space 2 opens me mail 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:45.340
 and then go to space 1 and open 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:48.160
 more skype so much initially too 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:49.180
 the topic autostadt we still grasp 

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:51.400
 briefly together 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:55.139
 autostart quickly and easily via 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:57.160
 the dock autostadt over the 

00:04:55.139 --> 00:04:59.889
 system settings and something more complex 

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:02.289
 with more options ie hidden 

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:04.870
 State does not start hidden and 

00:05:02.289 --> 00:05:07.710
 autostart refined in 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:10.090
 combination with exposé and spaces 

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:11.889
 I hope you have that now 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:13.479
 Otherwise, look at it 

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:16.240
 Just relax 

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:19.630
 It is a very efficient thing though 

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:21.520
 I start several programs 

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:22.539
 Thank you here for this job 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:25.120
