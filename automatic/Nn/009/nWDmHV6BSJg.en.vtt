brushes and blue first of all you need
to<00:00:10.170> roll<00:00:10.320> the<00:00:10.349> paper<00:00:10.590> using<00:00:11.070> the<00:00:11.219> brush<00:00:11.759> like

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
to roll the paper using the brush like

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.279 
to roll the paper using the brush like
this<00:00:13.040> then<00:00:14.040> take<00:00:14.490> out<00:00:14.639> the<00:00:14.820> brush<00:00:15.059> and<00:00:15.330> roll<00:00:16.170> it

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
this then take out the brush and roll it

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.760 
this then take out the brush and roll it
on<00:00:16.440> carefully<00:00:17.390> after<00:00:18.390> that<00:00:18.869> we<00:00:19.320> need<00:00:19.500> to<00:00:19.619> roll

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
on carefully after that we need to roll

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.580 
on carefully after that we need to roll
like<00:00:19.800> this<00:00:20.250> and<00:00:20.609> at<00:00:21.180> the<00:00:21.359> end<00:00:21.480> of<00:00:21.630> rolling<00:00:21.990> unit

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
like this and at the end of rolling unit

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.380 
like this and at the end of rolling unit
use<00:00:22.800> the<00:00:22.980> blue<00:00:23.250> to<00:00:24.240> make<00:00:24.600> it<00:00:25.109> stable<00:00:26.390> okay

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
use the blue to make it stable okay

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.000 
use the blue to make it stable okay
after<00:00:27.570> the<00:00:27.840> end<00:00:27.960> of<00:00:28.019> rolling<00:00:28.410> it<00:00:28.590> is<00:00:28.800> look<00:00:28.980> like

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
after the end of rolling it is look like

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.910 
after the end of rolling it is look like
a<00:00:29.220> stick<00:00:29.550> like<00:00:29.580> this<00:00:29.960> now<00:00:30.960> you<00:00:31.380> need<00:00:31.590> to<00:00:31.679> place

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
a stick like this now you need to place

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.970 
a stick like this now you need to place
it<00:00:31.949> from<00:00:32.309> the<00:00:32.489> center<00:00:32.730> to<00:00:33.390> the<00:00:33.420> ends<00:00:33.930> I<00:00:34.110> have

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
it from the center to the ends I have

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.979 
it from the center to the ends I have
drawn<00:00:35.219> an<00:00:35.370> arrow<00:00:35.489> to<00:00:36.030> make<00:00:36.270> you<00:00:36.420> sure<00:00:36.660> how<00:00:36.930> to

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
drawn an arrow to make you sure how to

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.530 
drawn an arrow to make you sure how to
do<00:00:37.200> that<00:00:37.230> now<00:00:38.040> again<00:00:38.760> start<00:00:39.030> rolling<00:00:39.420> the

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
do that now again start rolling the

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.180 
do that now again start rolling the
paper<00:00:39.719> from<00:00:40.680> one<00:00:40.950> end<00:00:41.190> using<00:00:42.030> the<00:00:42.120> brush<00:00:42.420> and

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:43.190 
paper from one end using the brush and

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:46.430 
paper from one end using the brush and
keep<00:00:44.190> rolling<00:00:44.370> it<00:00:44.700> until<00:00:45.510> it<00:00:45.690> becomes<00:00:46.079> a<00:00:46.200> coil

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
keep rolling it until it becomes a coil

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.639 
keep rolling it until it becomes a coil
like<00:00:46.530> this<00:00:46.980> now<00:00:47.879> use<00:00:48.149> glue<00:00:48.570> at<00:00:48.870> the<00:00:48.930> other<00:00:49.350> end

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
like this now use glue at the other end

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.330 
like this now use glue at the other end
to<00:00:50.280> stick<00:00:50.610> it<00:00:50.760> up<00:00:51.320> okay<00:00:52.320> after<00:00:52.530> sticking<00:00:52.949> it<00:00:53.190> up

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
to stick it up okay after sticking it up

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.250 
to stick it up okay after sticking it up
it<00:00:53.820> will<00:00:53.940> look<00:00:54.120> like<00:00:54.149> a<00:00:54.329> proper<00:00:54.690> coil<00:00:55.079> like

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
it will look like a proper coil like

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.610 
it will look like a proper coil like
this<00:00:55.730> now<00:00:56.730> your<00:00:56.910> coil<00:00:57.120> is<00:00:57.270> ready<00:00:57.480> you<00:00:58.379> need<00:00:58.559> to

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
this now your coil is ready you need to

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.360 
this now your coil is ready you need to
make<00:00:58.890> at<00:00:59.100> least<00:00:59.149> 15<00:01:00.149> coils<00:01:00.600> like<00:01:00.809> this<00:01:01.170> I<00:01:01.469> have

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
make at least 15 coils like this I have

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.170 
make at least 15 coils like this I have
made<00:01:02.910> it<00:01:03.030> before<00:01:03.180> so<00:01:03.870> I<00:01:04.170> can<00:01:04.650> show<00:01:04.799> you<00:01:04.860> now<00:01:05.180> you

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.690 
need to do the exact same thing with the
other<00:01:14.580> coils<00:01:15.090> I<00:01:15.330> will<00:01:15.930> be<00:01:16.020> using<00:01:16.380> green<00:01:16.979> red

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
other coils I will be using green red

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.010

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
sticking of the coils you need to put

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.090 
sticking of the coils you need to put
glue<00:01:29.549> like<00:01:29.759> this<00:01:29.790> and<00:01:30.409> stick<00:01:31.409> the<00:01:31.560> other<00:01:31.590> coil

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
glue like this and stick the other coil

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.240 
glue like this and stick the other coil
like<00:01:32.490> this<00:01:32.549> and<00:01:33.380> also<00:01:34.380> stick<00:01:34.590> another<00:01:34.829> coil

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
like this and also stick another coil

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.630 
like this and also stick another coil
like<00:01:36.150> this<00:01:36.590> after<00:01:37.590> sticking<00:01:37.979> up<00:01:38.130> all<00:01:38.340> the

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
like this after sticking up all the

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.880 
like this after sticking up all the
coils<00:01:39.000> it<00:01:39.299> will<00:01:39.479> look<00:01:39.659> like<00:01:39.720> this<00:01:40.079> make<00:01:40.860> sure

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
coils it will look like this make sure

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.230 
coils it will look like this make sure
that<00:01:41.490> it<00:01:41.729> is<00:01:41.820> dry<00:01:42.000> enough<00:01:42.299> for<00:01:42.570> wall<00:01:43.380> hanging

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:44.240 
that it is dry enough for wall hanging

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.590 
that it is dry enough for wall hanging
you<00:01:44.750> can<00:01:44.960> make<00:01:45.140> another<00:01:45.680> type<00:01:45.920> like<00:01:46.160> this<00:01:46.370> also

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:46.600 
you can make another type like this also

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.810 
you can make another type like this also
or<00:01:47.600> even<00:01:48.020> if<00:01:48.110> you<00:01:48.230> don't<00:01:48.410> color<00:01:48.740> it<00:01:49.550> will<00:01:49.700> be

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:49.820 
or even if you don't color it will be

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:52.630 
or even if you don't color it will be
very<00:01:50.000> beautiful<00:01:50.180> like<00:01:50.660> this<00:01:51.490> okay

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:52.640 
very beautiful like this okay
