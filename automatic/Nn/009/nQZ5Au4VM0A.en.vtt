 we can really use 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.960
 Well, we can really put the caps 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:25.810
 we want we do not have to 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.370
 let to the top and the f2 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:29.260
 little fine we can really put this 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:32.260
 we want if we can customize it 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:33.190
 from a to z and settat and that's why 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.600

 see you have all the stuff 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:14.520
 ok ah yes it's no I think of something 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.170
 which you really have everything or if you 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:18.990
 want to do a gradient and after I know 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:20.160
 not put a little round and also it's 

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:23.100
 the color basically those meals you want 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:25.620
 it's blue like that from above if 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:26.970
 you want it not really 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:28.470
 over it finally here it's really 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:30.209
 you can put it 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:32.880
 as you want from a to finally 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:35.190
 2nd look just add to 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:37.490
 add shapes and it can 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:39.770
 make things really cool 

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:41.750
 look at it I created a kind of small 

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:43.640
 monster in the space of two seconds and 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:45.080
 kind of eyes there is a species of 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:46.610
 weird mouth so it's true we 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:47.570
 could do that but really like 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:49.370
 you want you can put the 

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:51.350
 colors you do not want stingy for 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:51.830
 to make a French cape in two 

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:53.630
 seconds 

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:55.910
 you see you click you put 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:58.580
 blue you take that white priority 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:04:00.140
 this one after red this one and we're going 

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:01.280
 you have a cape of france is roughly 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:04.040
 I prefer to mark every time you 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:06.230
 add something that changes a link 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:06.650
 here so look I add that it 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:08.990
 exchange 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:10.310
 after when I make the ex army like 

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:12.710
 so we actually made that a link 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:13.640
 in fact it's this link there so when you 

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:16.430
 will have finished your course 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:16.760
 so we'll say you keep the map 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:18.590
 white 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:20.000
 when you have finished your four years 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:22.580
 once you have finished barrows 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:26.330
 aurelien you take the link and you 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:28.940

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:31.820
 you do the cape of France so we 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:32.920
 for the tutorial we will take a queue that 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:35.510
 is already done 

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:37.490
 so the one I have and that I have 

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:39.410
 currently and that I keep in this 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:46.610

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:00.370
 that's me that's how I 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:05.980
 here it is I am a little 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:09.560
 degraded to the top 12 

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:11.600

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:16.760
 I do not have to do what she likes me 

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:18.620
 well how in case I did 

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:21.110
 the sea ​​should you click on save and 

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:24.380
 your course is set to play so here

 in the description you will have a 

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:28.550

 not to find so dedications ali so 

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:36.440
 it's a good ten cape if it's 

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:38.220
 that they have each time the flag of 

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:40.560
 la France 

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:42.630
 so so a bit like the mine you 

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:44.310
 see it's not really that 20 players 

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:46.020
 with stronger logos and 

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:47.760
 little stuff besides who but that all 

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:49.740
 likewise represents France so I 

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:53.070
 gives you and a dozen in the 

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:54.200
 description you also have the worry 

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:57.690
 dish that I will put in the description 

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:59.010
 or if you have millions and 

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:02.580
 million obala you have you have 

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:04.440
 21000 you have 21000 different banner 

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:04.950
 so is called banners in fact they 

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:06.630
 new cape 

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:08.250
 you see there are full full 

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:10.590
 and just chick and you check or 

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:11.760
 ticket may be at the end of a 

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:13.560
 moment you will fall on a 

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:18.360
 capital and who will be love at first sight 

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:20.100
 between you and that's all there is 

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:21.990
 really a lot a lot so 

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:23.820
 the anoci on a site in the description 

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:25.200
 he does not really draw for example 

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:27.540
 I think that's why a 

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:29.160
 pokéball there that opened there are some 

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:31.860
 watch a little monster frankly 

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:35.190
 it's really stylish also has the points 

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:37.290
 who go I think who agrees so 

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:38.730
 so here I think it's pretty much 

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:39.810
 everything and so you have to click on his 

00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:41.580
 lips once in a nutshell that's what 

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:45.300
 also you will connect to the small 

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:47.480
 fine you go into banner you fool 

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:49.830
 the link you put it you go back 

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:51.270
 after you do on save to click 

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:52.940
 on save you restart your lunch on 

00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:55.590
 minecraft too that's important if not 

00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:57.240
 well it will not update itself 

00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:59.880
 automatically need to restart launcher 

00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:02.610
 and then you'll have your famous cape 

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:03.720
 so that's so it was not finally 

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:06.060
 really little tutorial because like 

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:08.520
