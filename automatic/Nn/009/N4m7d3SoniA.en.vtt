 small producer in the face of sustained demand and high profitability 

00:00:09.579 --> 00:00:13.479
 the process of forming Buddhas is the strong foundation of the production of 

00:00:13.479 --> 00:00:14.819
 Strawberry 

00:00:14.819 --> 00:00:19.449

 own the plants taken from the nursery alcampo of production 

00:00:24.499 --> 00:00:29.570
 the conditions necessary for a good production of Buddhas are to count 

00:00:29.569 --> 00:00:34.860
 with a vienna plot devised and disease-free media infrastructure 

00:00:34.859 --> 00:00:40.059
 abundant shadow water source near enough mulch and organic matter 

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:42.570
 to improve the soil

 the seedlings that are transplanted to the field at the end of March and in April the

 Each mother plant has a capacity to produce between 300 to 400 plants figures 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:24.290
 this data is putin to know how many mother plants there are to grow in the 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:29.240
 nursery in order to obtain the desired number for field cultivation 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.240
 regular irrigation is essential 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:37.880

 market will qualify the domestic market for fresh and natural consumption 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.869
 The bridge is also good raw material for industrial production
