like the small fish in the improved fish
mode<00:03:11.560> and<00:03:11.769> use<00:03:12.189> them<00:03:12.400> for<00:03:12.430> alchemy

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.140 

as<00:03:20.110> you<00:03:20.260> can<00:03:20.379> see<00:03:20.560> here<00:03:20.860> it<00:03:21.010> also<00:03:21.159> adds<00:03:21.610> a<00:03:21.879> lot

so if we take our newly acquired

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:34.440 
so if we take our newly acquired
ingredients<00:03:31.840> to<00:03:31.989> an<00:03:32.140> alchemy<00:03:32.560> table<00:03:33.269> we<00:03:34.269> can

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:34.450 
ingredients to an alchemy table we can

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:36.780 
ingredients to an alchemy table we can
use<00:03:34.599> them<00:03:34.840> just<00:03:35.349> like<00:03:35.739> regular<00:03:35.980> ingredients

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790
