00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
get the detail now I'm basically looking

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.069 
get the detail now I'm basically looking
to<00:00:58.980> get<00:00:59.100> fears<00:00:59.370> on<00:00:59.550> the<00:00:59.640> Pala<00:00:59.850> whenever<00:01:00.180> I<00:01:00.300> can

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
to get fears on the Pala whenever I can

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.770 
to get fears on the Pala whenever I can
it's<00:01:01.440> a<00:01:01.500> bit<00:01:01.649> of<00:01:01.739> extra<00:01:02.039> CC<00:01:02.399> on<00:01:02.520> him<00:01:02.670> and<00:01:03.660> it

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
it's a bit of extra CC on him and it

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.500 
it's a bit of extra CC on him and it
stops<00:01:04.019> him<00:01:04.140> dispelling<00:01:04.559> the<00:01:04.739> DK<00:01:05.129> a<00:01:05.159> bit<00:01:05.510> and

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
stops him dispelling the DK a bit and

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.530 
stops him dispelling the DK a bit and
maybe<00:01:07.260> opens<00:01:07.680> is<00:01:07.799> off<00:01:07.920> proto<00:01:08.130> Kali<00:01:08.540> it's

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
maybe opens is off proto Kali it's

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.060 
maybe opens is off proto Kali it's
pretty<00:01:09.900> much<00:01:10.020> impossible<00:01:10.350> for<00:01:10.680> the<00:01:10.740> mange<00:01:10.920> to

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
pretty much impossible for the mange to

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.070 
pretty much impossible for the mange to
get<00:01:11.189> apollyon<00:01:11.430> in<00:01:11.670> mobile<00:01:11.909> ways<00:01:12.060> just<00:01:12.750> because

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
get apollyon in mobile ways just because

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.390 
get apollyon in mobile ways just because
of<00:01:13.229> how<00:01:13.380> hard<00:01:13.530> he's<00:01:13.680> getting<00:01:13.920> tunneled<00:01:14.250> by<00:01:14.340> the

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:20.770 
that's okay now my main she gets a deep
sheep<00:03:19.319> on<00:03:19.500> a<00:03:19.530> pile<00:03:19.739> of<00:03:19.769> here<00:03:20.010> which<00:03:20.160> is<00:03:20.310> wicked

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:20.780 
sheep on a pile of here which is wicked

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:23.330 
sheep on a pile of here which is wicked
and<00:03:21.780> so<00:03:22.200> I'll<00:03:22.290> go<00:03:22.380> a<00:03:22.410> little<00:03:22.590> bit<00:03:22.739> offensive<00:03:23.190> I

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
and so I'll go a little bit offensive I

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:24.830 
and so I'll go a little bit offensive I
think<00:03:23.639> the<00:03:23.700> hunt<00:03:23.850> of<00:03:23.940> might<00:03:24.060> scare<00:03:24.299> me<00:03:24.510> here<00:03:24.660> so

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
think the hunt of might scare me here so

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.479 
think the hunt of might scare me here so
I<00:03:24.870> actually<00:03:24.989> used<00:03:25.319> a<00:03:25.500> doesn't<00:03:26.250> in<00:03:26.310> the<00:03:26.370> end

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:26.489 
I actually used a doesn't in the end

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:28.490 
I actually used a doesn't in the end
instead<00:03:26.880> they<00:03:27.000> swap<00:03:27.239> to<00:03:27.359> me<00:03:27.510> which<00:03:28.139> turns<00:03:28.410> out

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
instead they swap to me which turns out

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.559 
instead they swap to me which turns out
to<00:03:28.560> be<00:03:28.680> a<00:03:28.739> bit<00:03:28.920> of<00:03:28.980> a<00:03:29.040> mistake<00:03:29.359> since<00:03:30.359> I<00:03:30.480> get

00:03:30.559 --> 00:03:30.569 
to be a bit of a mistake since I get

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:33.650 
to be a bit of a mistake since I get
away<00:03:30.690> with<00:03:30.930> freedom<00:03:31.260> now<00:03:31.440> and<00:03:32.359> the<00:03:33.359> pilots

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
away with freedom now and the pilots

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:35.300 
away with freedom now and the pilots
bubbles<00:03:33.989> running<00:03:34.230> out<00:03:34.350> I'll<00:03:34.829> get<00:03:34.950> a<00:03:35.010> bit<00:03:35.160> of<00:03:35.250> a

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
bubbles running out I'll get a bit of a

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.400 
bubbles running out I'll get a bit of a
lucky<00:03:35.579> fear<00:03:35.819> here<00:03:35.970> on<00:03:36.060> or<00:03:36.180> on<00:03:36.329> mastery<00:03:36.690> I<00:03:36.900> have

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
lucky fear here on or on mastery I have

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:39.170 
lucky fear here on or on mastery I have
to<00:03:37.500> jump<00:03:37.739> up<00:03:37.889> to<00:03:37.920> get<00:03:38.190> it<00:03:38.340> but<00:03:38.700> it's<00:03:38.850> all<00:03:38.970> good

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
to jump up to get it but it's all good

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:40.580 
to jump up to get it but it's all good
because<00:03:39.209> now<00:03:39.660> we've<00:03:39.840> got<00:03:39.989> a<00:03:40.019> pilot<00:03:40.380> and<00:03:40.500> the

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
because now we've got a pilot and the

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:43.610 
because now we've got a pilot and the
Deacon<00:03:40.920> and<00:03:41.069> over<00:03:41.220> fear<00:03:41.840> the<00:03:42.840> BK<00:03:43.170> clear<00:03:43.380> delish

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
Deacon and over fear the BK clear delish

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.190 
Deacon and over fear the BK clear delish
born<00:03:43.859> so<00:03:43.950> he<00:03:44.010> gets<00:03:44.190> out<00:03:44.310> of<00:03:44.370> fear<00:03:44.700> but<00:03:45.450> we're<00:03:46.109> on

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 
born so he gets out of fear but we're on

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:47.180 
born so he gets out of fear but we're on
him<00:03:46.319> so<00:03:46.530> that's<00:03:46.650> fine

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
him so that's fine

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:50.690 
him so that's fine
and<00:03:47.970> we<00:03:48.120> managed<00:03:48.450> force<00:03:49.049> AMS<00:03:49.440> and<00:03:49.650> I<00:03:50.220> found

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700 
and we managed force AMS and I found

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:53.289 
and we managed force AMS and I found
here<00:03:50.880> so<00:03:51.690> that<00:03:52.109> makes<00:03:52.290> him<00:03:52.410> a<00:03:52.530> viable<00:03:52.680> target

00:03:53.289 --> 00:03:53.299 
here so that makes him a viable target

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:55.280 
here so that makes him a viable target

00:04:11.059 --> 00:04:11.069 
in trouble I managed to get a double

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:12.680 
in trouble I managed to get a double
fear<00:04:11.370> though<00:04:11.519> here<00:04:11.760> on<00:04:11.910> the<00:04:12.030> DK<00:04:12.329> and<00:04:12.450> the<00:04:12.510> power

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:12.690 
fear though here on the DK and the power

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:14.000 
fear though here on the DK and the power
and<00:04:12.959> neither<00:04:13.410> of<00:04:13.500> them<00:04:13.650> actually<00:04:13.769> have

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.010 
and neither of them actually have

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:15.949 
and neither of them actually have
breakers<00:04:14.430> and<00:04:15.090> the<00:04:15.239> pile<00:04:15.419> is<00:04:15.540> actually<00:04:15.750> miles

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:15.959 
breakers and the pile is actually miles

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:18.650 
breakers and the pile is actually miles
away<00:04:16.229> so<00:04:16.289> we<00:04:16.500> call<00:04:16.680> for<00:04:16.799> a<00:04:16.829> swap<00:04:17.010> on<00:04:17.160> the<00:04:17.250> DK<00:04:17.660> and

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:18.660 
away so we call for a swap on the DK and

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:20.420 
away so we call for a swap on the DK and
I<00:04:18.780> just<00:04:18.989> leave<00:04:19.079> my<00:04:19.229> major<00:04:19.440> 50%<00:04:20.099> and<00:04:20.190> start

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430 
I just leave my major 50% and start

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:22.350 
I just leave my major 50% and start
spamming<00:04:20.669> damage<00:04:21.060> into<00:04:21.269> the<00:04:21.359> DK
