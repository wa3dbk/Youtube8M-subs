00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:15.869
 the idea of â€‹â€‹making this bait was 

00:00:14.699 --> 00:00:19.560
 reach not 

00:00:15.869 --> 00:00:22.890
 imitation of an exact copy of water bodies 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:25.680
 food objects of fish that can 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:28.169
 catch not only predator well and peaceful 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.779
 fish species for the prototype of these baits 

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:34.800
 They took exactly living in our waters 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:37.800
 and dragonfly larvae of the spring swimmer beetle 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:40.829
 and made exact copies repeated 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.210
 literally to the smallest detail this 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.230
 the bait can be used practically 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:48.949
 all year round with the same success as 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:52.469
 larvae of dragonflies and some of these 

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:54.149
 insects live in water up to 3 years 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.850
 and the fish don't stop eating them 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:59.339
 almost year round 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:01.589
 wiring used to catch this 

00:00:59.339 --> 00:01:03.120
 bait must also imitate 

00:01:01.589 --> 00:01:06.870
 behavior of the living 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:09.930
 the larvae that is some kind of smooth 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:12.909
 moving off the bottom some jumps 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:15.880
 small to this kind of sharp 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:20.109
 movement on should not do that is to eat 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:22.780
 real life these insects live at the bottom 

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:26.850
 crawling about somehow slowly crawling along 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:26.850
 plant stalks in the grass 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:49.200
 vesa which can be used of course 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:53.220
 need to fit under the conditions of fishing but 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:55.620
 most often it is still not heavy ruza 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:58.380
 because heavy load to carry out smoothly 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:00.750
 a little bit difficult in time 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:03.090
 the existence of this bait on her was 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:05.750
 caught almost all and come on lineup 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:09.720
 fish that inhabit our waters 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:10.380
 there were such exotic fish as 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.650
 podust 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:17.090
 I labor trout also 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:19.140
 caught successfully by this bait even 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:22.370
 some anglers use it to 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:22.370
 wild trout fishing 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:31.200
 the bait that is being played has played 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:34.680
 quite a weighty role in winning 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:36.750
 stage of the Kiev region cup fishing 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.250
 predator from the shore on about one channel 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:42.000
 really appreciated 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:44.550
 when the fish becomes cautious when 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.630
 it takes a long pause then at first 

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:50.750
 the plan seems to me to go no longer 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:54.170
 the wave that creates there is the bait to her 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:56.210
 appearance and in such conditions well then 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:58.910
 there is when for a long time but to delay 

00:03:56.210 --> 00:04:01.190
 bait on the bottom such bait that 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:04.880
 accurately mimics insect living object 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:07.750
 then they certainly have a very substantial 

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:11.420
 gain compared to the classics therefore 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:14.450
 the bait is not weighty enough for us 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:15.940
 argument in the fight for the championship and here 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:19.390
 I really liked her 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:22.580
 I will continue to develop this topic of course 

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:24.710
 such imitation is not in two cases very 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:26.720
 have a significant advantage over others 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:28.810
 lures are when clean water and 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:32.600
 required long pause what spoke 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:33.689
 long delays at the bottom and the second is 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:36.089
 when 

00:04:33.689 --> 00:04:37.949
 fishing is obviously in swampy places 

00:04:36.089 --> 00:04:41.369
 that is, clearly there where presence 

00:04:37.949 --> 00:04:43.919
 insects eat aquatic but per hour and if you 

00:04:41.369 --> 00:04:44.729
 see the reed before that goes into the water 

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:46.829
 deep 

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:48.959
 or do you see some shallow water 

00:04:46.829 --> 00:04:51.779
 grassy bay so swampy 

00:04:48.959 --> 00:04:56.509
 plan then this is a direct command in order 

00:04:51.779 --> 00:04:56.509
 to start using these baits
