00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.859
 hello everyone again from the channel 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:06.950
 txingas 12 where we will see how to make a 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:09.929
 experiment that is a bit strange 

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:12.480
 will consist in making today a 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.880
 ounce of chocolate a square of the 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:18.539
 nothing that appears without more to do it 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:21.720
 we need a tablet that is 6 x 4 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.820
 ounces we have 24 in total and 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.560
 apart from that something to cut it 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.869
 I'm going to take a cutter and a lighter 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.300
 to warm it up a bit and cut something 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.669
 better the first cut that we have 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.219
 what to do is from the second ounce 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:40.460
 starting here from the second 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:40.460
 until the third a straight line cut 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:52.320
 good a bit this part but as you see 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.839
 we have made the cut now the next 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:01:00.260
 cut that we will have to do will be here 

00:00:54.839 --> 00:01:00.260
 separating this line of ounces 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.850
 once we have made this cut the only 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:15.150
 What we have left to do is to remove this 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:18.360
 last this last ounce 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.820
 and then how was it mounted before 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.670
 Tablet 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:25.120
 would have had to be here to take out 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.120
 a little more 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:36.510
 we would have 1 2 3 4 5 6 6 for 1 2 3 4 24 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:41.280
 ounces but if now we remove this 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:45.020
 and we change these pieces 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.020
 to hope that two pieces have been left 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:53.060
 and we change these pieces 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:57.110
 we have 1 2 3 4 5 6 x 1 2 3 4 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:02:00.020
 24 ounces and we have a spare one is a video 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:01.369
 little bit strange I do not know exactly what is 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.899
 the explanation but good is something 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:03.630
 awesome when you see it for the first 

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:06.060
 time 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.570
 I hope you liked it and this has 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.570
 been everything for today
