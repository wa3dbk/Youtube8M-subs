00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:10.400

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.369
 see for the bag 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:31.969
 we have the features for two 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:36.000
 people to enhance stitch 8 kg 

00:00:31.969 --> 00:00:42.899
 length 295 height 105 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:47.070
 but sorry length 295 I know how 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:52.649
 the wrong width 155 295 changes the 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:56.789
 depth and height 110 cm this is the 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:59.059
 bag and this is the tent mounted above 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:03.090
 there is also my 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:06.360
 really spacious really spacious there 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:09.030
 you can do anything can get in 3 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:13.200
 david I don't want to overdo it either 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:15.720
 two Emilians the 2xl 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:19.860
 in particular also this space 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:22.170
 extra here where you can 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.990
 put all your shit type le 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.900
 shoes or lizzani so that later 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:30.659
 close everything in the purple house 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:33.630
 no nothing happens your stuff is 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:35.130
 tired in a few or for sure the thing 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.939
 very interesting to note that there are 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:40.950
 two layers an inner layer 

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:43.619
 waterproof under and with a membrane 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:47.640
 breathable and with so many other nin limbs 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:49.890
 and nice is on there is a cloth instead 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:53.899
 waterproof this green as you can 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.899
 see everything supported by these 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:59.340
 raceways and tubulars that yes 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:00.960
 they close that supports everything 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.340
 here you can also see the inside how much 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.540
 cabbage is what makes me spacious 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.670
 to understand 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:08.820
 is really operated in the smallest details 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:12.120
 there are openings here for air 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:14.600
 and on the other side in this cloth 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:18.030
 green that you can see above are there 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:19.830
 these are these sorts of implications that 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:23.580
 they delude even more to keep everything 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:27.630
 how well closed and covered and how 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:28.620
 you can see what I say personally 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:30.720
 the with bucket 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:32.970
 as I said it is spacious and is high 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.830
 if you want to get around especially 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:37.890
 with your boyfriend with yours 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:39.870
 boy is perfect 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:43.650
 you can really do that 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:47.180
 what you want and signed I saw that too 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:49.709
 quite high is really spacious 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:52.680
 small flaw he has 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:55.640
 forget that shit of what type 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:59.850
 car mountable no no no no shit 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:00.360
 this eagle really got into five 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:03.420
 minutes 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:05.340
 does not exist does not exist that shit 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:07.080
 plus then close it in this one 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:08.700
 bag that is a bit big anyway 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:10.560
 these realities the one we will talk about 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:12.810
 later that shit instead 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:15.080
 resealable not let their 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.080
 partial 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:21.420
 the only flaw as I said and that 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:23.430
 slightly pesantuccia 3.8 feel it 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:26.340
 ring around and the bag was tax la 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:27.150
 type must be mounted in a backpack with 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.430
 of the ropes 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:32.250
 in short, usual way above or below the 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:35.910
 glue the thing that could help you that 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:39.600
 given the length that is a bit the glue 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:43.769
 because longer than a normalize is 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:45.030
 mainly given by the battens from 

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:47.430
 these sticks some then go to 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:49.200
 compose the tubular these splints 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:50.610
 instead it has succeeded instead for example 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:53.310
 water 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:55.049
 if instead managed to put them for 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:56.730
 example in the backpack has succeeded in 

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:59.280
 close the slightly wrong way the 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:02.700
 tent thing I can't do you can 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:04.709
 then I also think it actually halves the 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:06.120
 length of this bag by pruning it 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:08.459
 really put that everywhere 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:10.080
 point is very light the battens neither 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:12.419
 rozzano you will never hear them because 

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:15.400
 will be missing a chiletto is this that 

00:04:12.419 --> 00:04:19.479
 attacking from behind is really right 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:23.020
 a trifle and makeover is 

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:24.880
 another an opening this type a 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:27.310
 other place look how much it sucks 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:28.780
 that curtain compared to mine at 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:30.639
 mine this water and that born tern of 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:33.669
 shit what god 

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:36.400
 guys I recommend the price if you 

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:37.750
 I don't remember badly about fifty 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:40.300
 sixty hera I don't mean 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:43.300
 crap strings on the site is available 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:44.800
 in green available in blue than anything else 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:49.199
 you can ask the mother in short 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:49.199
 the house is bought beautiful
