00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:03.360 
all right I'm gonna do a review here on

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:08.059 
all right I'm gonna do a review here on
the<00:00:03.480> Honda<00:00:04.730> EU<00:00:05.730> mm<00:00:06.690> ah<00:00:06.950> generator

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
the Honda EU mm ah generator

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.540 
the Honda EU mm ah generator
it's<00:00:08.340> an<00:00:08.429> inverter<00:00:08.790> I<00:00:09.920> just<00:00:10.920> got<00:00:11.099> this<00:00:11.340> this

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
it's an inverter I just got this this

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.780 
it's an inverter I just got this this
past<00:00:11.790> year<00:00:12.240> it's<00:00:12.870> a<00:00:12.990> very<00:00:13.410> very<00:00:13.860> quiet<00:00:14.309> unit

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
past year it's a very very quiet unit

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.620 
past year it's a very very quiet unit
very<00:00:15.450> good<00:00:15.690> unit<00:00:16.049> to<00:00:16.260> starts<00:00:17.070> real<00:00:17.250> easy<00:00:17.630> it's

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
very good unit to starts real easy it's

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.269 
very good unit to starts real easy it's
got<00:00:18.750> a<00:00:18.779> fuel<00:00:19.109> shutoff<00:00:19.410> here<00:00:19.859> so<00:00:20.010> that<00:00:20.100> way<00:00:20.189> if

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
got a fuel shutoff here so that way if

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:21.529 
got a fuel shutoff here so that way if
you<00:00:20.369> want<00:00:20.550> to<00:00:20.640> put<00:00:20.789> it<00:00:20.850> in<00:00:20.910> your<00:00:21.000> pickup<00:00:21.210> truck

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
you want to put it in your pickup truck

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.490 
you want to put it in your pickup truck
and<00:00:22.350> haul<00:00:22.529> it<00:00:22.619> around<00:00:22.710> you<00:00:23.010> don't<00:00:23.160> smell<00:00:23.369> fuel

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:24.500 
and haul it around you don't smell fuel

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.310 
and haul it around you don't smell fuel
it<00:00:25.500> starts<00:00:25.890> on<00:00:25.980> the<00:00:26.039> second<00:00:26.430> pull<00:00:27.170> it's<00:00:28.170> got

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
it starts on the second pull it's got

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.650 
it starts on the second pull it's got
two<00:00:28.529> outlets<00:00:28.859> on<00:00:29.039> it<00:00:29.189> 110<00:00:29.609> outlets<00:00:30.029> it's<00:00:30.510> also

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
two outlets on it 110 outlets it's also

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.020 
two outlets on it 110 outlets it's also
got<00:00:31.019> the<00:00:31.199> slot<00:00:31.920> here<00:00:32.250> where<00:00:32.430> you<00:00:32.550> can<00:00:32.700> hook<00:00:32.880> up

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
got the slot here where you can hook up

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.910 
got the slot here where you can hook up
another<00:00:33.270> generator<00:00:33.750> parallel

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
another generator parallel

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.740 
another generator parallel
it's<00:00:35.309> even<00:00:35.550> got<00:00:35.579> a<00:00:35.700> battery<00:00:36.180> charger

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
it's even got a battery charger

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:42.319 
it's even got a battery charger
connection<00:00:37.500> on<00:00:37.649> it<00:00:37.800> I<00:00:38.010> don't<00:00:38.489> have<00:00:38.670> that<00:00:38.910> I<00:00:41.329> I'm

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
connection on it I don't have that I I'm

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.080 
connection on it I don't have that I I'm
putting<00:00:42.690> a<00:00:42.750> few<00:00:42.930> generators<00:00:43.530> but<00:00:44.399> this<00:00:44.789> right

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
putting a few generators but this right

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.180 
putting a few generators but this right
here<00:00:45.270> is<00:00:45.390> probably<00:00:45.809> the<00:00:46.289> best<00:00:46.500> one<00:00:46.680> so<00:00:46.950> far<00:00:46.980> I

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
here is probably the best one so far I

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.889 
here is probably the best one so far I
haven't<00:00:47.430> had<00:00:47.579> to<00:00:47.820> actually<00:00:48.300> knock<00:00:48.510> on<00:00:48.690> wood

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
haven't had to actually knock on wood

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.279 
haven't had to actually knock on wood
and<00:00:49.140> use<00:00:49.379> it<00:00:49.590> for<00:00:50.489> emergency<00:00:51.149> reasons<00:00:51.360> yet<00:00:51.809> but

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
and use it for emergency reasons yet but

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.170 
and use it for emergency reasons yet but
it's<00:00:52.440> been<00:00:52.620> nice<00:00:52.800> to<00:00:52.980> take<00:00:53.190> out<00:00:53.370> the<00:00:53.610> building

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
it's been nice to take out the building

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.150 
it's been nice to take out the building
I<00:00:54.390> don't<00:00:54.750> have<00:00:54.870> power<00:00:55.110> in<00:00:55.410> things<00:00:55.860> and<00:00:56.039> run

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
I don't have power in things and run

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.110 
I don't have power in things and run
power<00:00:56.430> tools<00:00:56.760> uh<00:00:58.430> you<00:00:59.430> know<00:00:59.550> I<00:00:59.579> know<00:00:59.820> that

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
power tools uh you know I know that

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.560 
power tools uh you know I know that
these<00:01:00.239> are<00:01:00.300> close<00:01:00.719> to<00:01:00.870> $1,000<00:01:01.739> okay<00:01:02.460> and<00:01:02.730> you

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
these are close to $1,000 okay and you

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.969 
these are close to $1,000 okay and you
know<00:01:03.660> they<00:01:03.780> are<00:01:03.899> pretty<00:01:04.140> pricey<00:01:04.500> but<00:01:04.890> you<00:01:05.640> know

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:06.979 
know they are pretty pricey but you know

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:09.260 
know they are pretty pricey but you know
nothing<00:01:07.979> like<00:01:08.100> having<00:01:08.280> a<00:01:08.460> good<00:01:08.580> quality<00:01:08.790> piece

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
nothing like having a good quality piece

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.060 
nothing like having a good quality piece
of<00:01:09.330> equipment<00:01:09.510> when<00:01:10.020> you<00:01:10.140> need<00:01:10.320> backup<00:01:10.920> power

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
of equipment when you need backup power

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.550 
of equipment when you need backup power
this<00:01:11.850> isn't<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:12.390> most<00:01:12.630> powerfully<00:01:13.260> and<00:01:13.320> as

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
this isn't the most powerfully and as

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.240 
this isn't the most powerfully and as
you<00:01:13.710> see<00:01:13.920> it's<00:01:14.070> a<00:01:14.159> 2000<00:01:14.790> watt<00:01:15.420> inverter<00:01:16.250> but

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
you see it's a 2000 watt inverter but

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.020 
you see it's a 2000 watt inverter but
it's<00:01:17.670> good<00:01:17.909> for<00:01:18.240> you<00:01:18.750> know<00:01:18.869> emergencies<00:01:20.030> one

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
it's good for you know emergencies one

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.910 
it's good for you know emergencies one
thing<00:01:21.180> it<00:01:21.270> taught<00:01:21.509> me<00:01:21.540> a<00:01:21.750> good<00:01:22.259> lesson<00:01:22.320> was

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
thing it taught me a good lesson was

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.620 
thing it taught me a good lesson was
2012<00:01:23.880> 2012<00:01:25.520> we<00:01:26.520> had<00:01:26.610> two<00:01:26.820> major<00:01:27.030> storms<00:01:27.540> that

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
2012 2012 we had two major storms that

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.630 
2012 2012 we had two major storms that
come<00:01:27.840> through<00:01:28.020> here<00:01:28.290> in<00:01:28.320> West<00:01:28.650> Virginia<00:01:28.740> at

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
come through here in West Virginia at

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:30.950 
come through here in West Virginia at
the<00:01:29.700> time<00:01:29.939> I<00:01:30.090> was<00:01:30.210> living<00:01:30.450> in<00:01:30.540> Preston<00:01:30.930> County

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
the time I was living in Preston County

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.190 
the time I was living in Preston County
and<00:01:31.470> we<00:01:32.070> had<00:01:32.189> the<00:01:32.340> duration<00:01:32.820> in<00:01:33.119> June<00:01:33.299> of<00:01:33.450> 2012

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
and we had the duration in June of 2012

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.280 
and we had the duration in June of 2012
and<00:01:34.740> we<00:01:34.799> had<00:01:35.640> hurricane<00:01:36.299> sandy<00:01:36.750> trip<00:01:36.960> through

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
and we had hurricane sandy trip through

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.899 
and we had hurricane sandy trip through
in<00:01:37.700> October<00:01:38.700> of<00:01:38.939> last<00:01:39.090> year<00:01:39.540> I<00:01:40.640> can<00:01:41.640> tell<00:01:41.850> you

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
in October of last year I can tell you

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.920 
in October of last year I can tell you
this<00:01:42.119> from<00:01:42.420> Hurricane<00:01:43.229> sandy<00:01:43.259> last<00:01:44.250> year<00:01:44.579> I

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:44.930 
this from Hurricane sandy last year I

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:47.330 
this from Hurricane sandy last year I
definitely<00:01:45.930> realized<00:01:46.860> that<00:01:47.100> a<00:01:47.130> good

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
definitely realized that a good

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.280 
definitely realized that a good
generator<00:01:47.909> would<00:01:48.090> be<00:01:48.149> the<00:01:48.329> way<00:01:48.479> to<00:01:48.509> go

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
generator would be the way to go

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.679 
generator would be the way to go
I<00:01:49.320> have<00:01:49.920> my<00:01:50.100> big<00:01:50.280> welder<00:01:50.520> unit<00:01:50.970> my<00:01:51.180> big<00:01:51.360> welding

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
I have my big welder unit my big welding

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.109 
I have my big welder unit my big welding
unit<00:01:51.840> my<00:01:52.140> most<00:01:52.950> Hobart<00:01:53.369> slash<00:01:53.670> mill<00:01:53.939> or

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
unit my most Hobart slash mill or

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.780 
unit my most Hobart slash mill or
whatever<00:01:54.420> champion<00:01:54.930> ten<00:01:55.079> thousand<00:01:55.670> it's<00:01:56.670> a

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
whatever champion ten thousand it's a

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.700 
whatever champion ten thousand it's a
great<00:01:57.000> unit<00:01:57.329> but<00:01:57.479> yet<00:01:57.659> it's<00:01:58.110> awfully<00:01:58.469> heavy

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
great unit but yet it's awfully heavy

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.319 
great unit but yet it's awfully heavy
and<00:01:58.979> I'd<00:01:59.070> have<00:01:59.219> to<00:01:59.250> have<00:01:59.399> the<00:01:59.549> farm<00:01:59.820> tracker<00:02:00.119> to

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
and I'd have to have the farm tracker to

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:03.859
