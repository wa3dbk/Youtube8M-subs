00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.710
 the turn in research the 

00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:05.150
 Chinese and Malaysian authorities continue 

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:08.509
 trying to find the whereabouts of 

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:11.839
 boeing 777 200 that the past disappeared 

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:13.459
 Friday with 239 people on board according to 

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:15.559
 the civil aviation radars the 

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:17.630
 aircraft would have turned around before 

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:19.460
 of losing contact with land now 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:21.200
 examine the possibilities of an attack 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:23.570
 terrorist 

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:25.550
 in china and in malaysia the families of 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:29.540
 the missing people with the flight 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:31.400
 mh 370 of malaysia airlines refuse to 

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:34.370
 lose hope 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:35.960
 less than 48 hours later the whereabouts 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:38.210
 of the aircraft remains a mystery 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:40.250
 the authorities announced that the 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:42.620
 rescue teams expanded the area of 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:44.750
 Search in the Gulf of Thailand 22 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:47.360
 aircraft and 40 vessels from malaysia 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:50.019
 vietnam singapore and indonesia participate 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.019
 in the operative 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:54.650
 we affirm that our search has now 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.110
 been extended to a wider area 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:59.120
 because there is a possibility that the 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:00.559
 plane has hanged in that case 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:04.790
 different areas will have to be 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:06.650
 identified radar data 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.110
 of the armed forces and of aviation 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:10.940
 civil they threw information 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:13.280
 puzzling would indicate that the plane 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:15.619
 could have turned around before 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:18.260
 disappear the pilot would not have 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:19.630
 informed nothing about it now he 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.890
 investigates a possible terrorist attack 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:23.810
 after knowing that at least two 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:26.479
 passengers were traveling with false passports 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:28.050
 and there are suspicions about the identity of 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:30.660
 minus two others 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:32.070
 there are only two passengers who are in the 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:34.980
 record that they traveled with passports 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:37.440
 false we have images of the circuit 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:39.870
 closed television of the individuals 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:42.210
 from check-in to the point of 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:44.700
 starting these images are now object 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.680
 of investigation the personnel of the 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.740
 airline did not give much hope to 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.540
 families and we have communicated to 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.490
 members of the family that after 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.740
 more than 30 hours without any contact with 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:58.110
 the aircraft we think they should 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.670
 prepare for the worst we're going to talk 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.100
 with them to know how many they want 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.750
 travel and how soon we will have to 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.790
 work hand in hand with the authorities 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.530
 from China and Malaysia because many of the 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:10.710
 relatives of the victims do not have 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:13.530
 passports in the middle of the growing 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:16.080
 despair the authorities saw a 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:18.720
 unexpected turn I did an investigation 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.790
 the US will send agents from the 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.640
 fbi to help with the work of 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:26.690
 intelligence 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:29.870
 the boeing 777-200 of malaysia airlines 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:32.620
