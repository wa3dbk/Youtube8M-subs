 I have already published this series then 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:02.120
 if you happen to have this someone 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.530

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:06.110
 regarding this video game 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:09.380
 next to me my mat is ready 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:10.490
 will be the video on my account for how much 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:12.350
 concerns abdominals 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:15.200
 so all unreliable sprinters don't 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:17.329
 too difficult that you can want 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.369
 enhance or meanwhile serial number 

00:01:17.329 --> 00:01:21.920
 or using for some types 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:24.049
 also the pieces and you can admire 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:27.560
 these exercises to the video I already have 

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:28.659
 published on the buttocks so you can 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.640
 create like this 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:32.740
 and even more complete must begin 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:36.609
 I immediately wait for all your comments 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:39.579
 below and sending you a greater 

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:41.109
 great we do well let's start with 

00:01:39.579 --> 00:01:42.549
 heating and stretching for a 

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:44.079
 more in-depth heating vi 

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:45.369
 I refer to the video on luthi he already has 

00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:47.439
 published 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:49.030
 otherwise if you have already carried out 

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:51.130
 exercises previously you can 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:55.259
 simply carry out these simple 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:55.259
 heating movements 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:08.560
 first exercise 8 normal crunchies 8 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:09.580
 with legs at 45 degrees 8 with legs a 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.620
 180 degrees 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:14.769
 lying on a mat we fold the 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:17.260
 legs and we carry up and down the shoulders 

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:20.890
 without bending the neck excessively 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:22.900
 then looking up and looking 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:26.080
 precisely to focus on 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:30.160
 exclusive contraction of dominating I 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:32.650
 I repeat this number of repetitions for 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:35.579
 three series of course you can increase it and 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:35.579
 decrease 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:41.780
 I am 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:51.739
 second exercise the 28 normal 8 with the 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:54.050
 legs and 8 with legs and arms who yes 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:56.989
 in this case they also touch lying down 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:59.239
 with legs bent at 45 degrees 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:01.819
 we bring the pelvis backwards 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:06.470
 focusing on the contraction of the 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:09.110
 dominate we repeat the same movement 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:11.870
 but this time bringing it upwards 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:13.840
 also shoulders at the same time 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:16.790
 with the pelvis 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:20.870
 finally to the 38 repetitions that they foresee 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:22.610
 then stretch your legs upwards 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:25.640
 we make a further contraction 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:27.890
 of the abdominal third exercise but 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:29.209
 brown the former I normally your 12 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:31.370
 repetitions because I find this 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:34.040
 very intense exercise position of 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:34.849
 team departure we go up and down with the 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:36.590
 legs 

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:38.900
 be careful not to buckle the 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:40.940
 back then if you notice that el 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:42.590
 exercise is too intense because 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:44.900
 the markets too back 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:46.819
 you can not bring your legs up to 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:49.209
 floor but observe yourself at a height 

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:49.209
 higher 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:57.030
 how much exercise you are performing bike 12 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:58.440
 repetitions per side and with position 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:00.540
 of departure 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:03.030
 I raise my right shoulder lengthening the 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:05.280
 arm is stretching at the same time 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:07.860
 also the legs taking me to the side 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:09.330
 opposite or to the left with this 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:13.520
 exercise that we really want a lot 

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:13.520
 well all the ubiquitous abdominal band 

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:26.670
 new exercise seems to focus on studies 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:28.560
 oblique effect of 12 petitions spoken 

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:31.440
 at a normal speed at a speed 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:33.660
 more exercise really super suitable 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:35.610
 to counter the famous handles 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:37.080
 of love and with the position of 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:40.230
 departure also in this case me 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:43.290
 I also use a piece but you can not 

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:45.330
 use it if you prefer is empty on 

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:49.590
 bust first right and then left 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:51.930
 contracting very well and slanting effect 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:54.770
 12 repetition at this speed and 11 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:54.770
 at a higher speed 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:13.300
 again a more intense exercise 

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:15.759
 we are in positions of planck and we carry 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:20.259
 for 25 repetitions the knees before 

00:05:15.759 --> 00:05:31.090
 right and then left trying not to 

00:05:20.259 --> 00:05:32.830
 arch your back too much 

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:35.199
 then led to the planta position 

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:37.840
 side and I go up and down with the pelvis 

00:05:35.199 --> 00:05:40.419
 contracting the good part of them job here 

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:42.910
 then I respect the 25 repetitions with the 

00:05:40.419 --> 00:05:45.260
 knees and the other eight of petitions 

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:47.510
 of said blanc and on the other side 

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:49.730
 Let us now turn back and the station 8 

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:51.920
 repetitions with alternating legs 8 with 

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:54.020
 gam and screw and 8 with legs and arms 

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:56.570
 this exercise was strength and muscle 

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:58.160
 lower backbones which are the muscles 

00:05:56.570 --> 00:06:00.770
 abdominal antagonists and that 

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:02.540
 they are often overlooked instead they are 

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:04.480
 very important because they end 

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:07.430
 at the center of strength for many movements 

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:09.890
 then cut with the belly to the ground 

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:13.160
 if empty of petitions bringing up and down 

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:15.410
 the legs and just contracting the muscles 

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:21.020
 dorsal then along the lower part 

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:23.060
 of the back 8 repetitions bringing up 

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:25.820
 and down at the same time as the legs and then 

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:28.600
 to 38 repetitions with legs and arms in 

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:28.600
 Contemporary 

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:34.820
 last exercise lateral lance performs 

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:36.890
 20 repetitions per side the position of 

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:39.320
 departure and lateral lunge is 

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:41.170
 very light therefore not very marked ed 

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:43.760
 exercise plans to raise 

00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:46.520
 at the same time laterally arm 

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:49.220
 and opposite leg I understand very well 

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:51.050
 the oblique in this video I use a 

00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:53.270
 piece of 2 kg but I assure you that 

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:56.060
 this exercise is really a lot 

00:06:53.270 --> 00:07:07.550
 effective even without the use of weights 

00:06:56.060 --> 00:07:09.590
 try to believe to conclude 

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:12.080
 then we move on to the final stretching 

00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:13.910
 a whole series of small exercises of 

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:18.350
 stretching of the muscles that 

00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:20.150
 we have made girls work well there 

00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:21.590
