00:00:00.619 --> 00:00:04.550 

the<00:00:01.619> question<00:00:02.040> I<00:00:02.250> received<00:00:02.879> in<00:00:03.330> an<00:00:03.749> email<00:00:03.989> and

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:04.560 
the question I received in an email and

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.550 
the question I received in an email and
I<00:00:05.220> tried<00:00:05.759> to<00:00:05.879> draw<00:00:06.120> it<00:00:06.270> in<00:00:06.540> a<00:00:06.870> couple<00:00:07.470> of

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560 
I tried to draw it in a couple of

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.700 
I tried to draw it in a couple of
different<00:00:08.070> things<00:00:08.960> I<00:00:09.960> got<00:00:10.200> on<00:00:10.410> the<00:00:10.560> computer

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
different things I got on the computer

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.280 
different things I got on the computer
and<00:00:11.130> I<00:00:11.520> couldn't<00:00:12.030> draw<00:00:12.360> it<00:00:12.570> so<00:00:12.750> I<00:00:12.780> figured<00:00:12.900> out

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
and I couldn't draw it so I figured out

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:14.420 
and I couldn't draw it so I figured out
what<00:00:13.470> the<00:00:13.590> heck<00:00:13.770> I'm<00:00:13.950> gonna<00:00:14.100> go<00:00:14.220> in<00:00:14.340> the

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:14.430 
what the heck I'm gonna go in the

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:17.150 
what the heck I'm gonna go in the
backyard<00:00:14.700> and<00:00:15.480> flatten<00:00:16.199> off<00:00:16.349> the<00:00:16.529> surface<00:00:16.949> and

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
backyard and flatten off the surface and

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.999 
backyard and flatten off the surface and
mound<00:00:17.400> up<00:00:17.609> some<00:00:17.849> dirt<00:00:18.150> and<00:00:18.509> see<00:00:19.499> if<00:00:19.619> I<00:00:19.740> can't

00:00:19.999 --> 00:00:20.009 
mound up some dirt and see if I can't

00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:23.900 
mound up some dirt and see if I can't
explain<00:00:20.519> it<00:00:20.669> this<00:00:21.390> way<00:00:21.449> so<00:00:22.169> the<00:00:22.890> picture<00:00:23.490> was

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
explain it this way so the picture was

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.509 
explain it this way so the picture was
of<00:00:23.939> a<00:00:24.539> home<00:00:25.230> that<00:00:25.619> was<00:00:25.769> on<00:00:25.919> the<00:00:26.039> top<00:00:26.249> of<00:00:26.279> a

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
of a home that was on the top of a

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.220 
of a home that was on the top of a
mountain<00:00:26.730> and<00:00:27.560> the<00:00:29.419> at<00:00:30.419> the<00:00:30.570> bottom<00:00:30.960> of<00:00:31.109> the

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
mountain and the at the bottom of the

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.500 
mountain and the at the bottom of the
hill<00:00:31.439> I<00:00:31.470> would<00:00:31.829> imagine<00:00:32.070> the<00:00:32.520> home<00:00:33.240> was

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
hill I would imagine the home was

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.910 
hill I would imagine the home was
probably<00:00:34.050> about<00:00:34.260> a<00:00:34.320> hundred<00:00:34.590> feet<00:00:35.040> above<00:00:35.480> the

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:36.920 
probably about a hundred feet above the

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.890 
probably about a hundred feet above the
site<00:00:37.920> of<00:00:38.130> a<00:00:38.220> mountain<00:00:38.640> so<00:00:39.030> we<00:00:39.270> had<00:00:39.420> the<00:00:39.570> home<00:00:39.720> at

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:39.900 
site of a mountain so we had the home at

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.950 
site of a mountain so we had the home at
the<00:00:39.930> top<00:00:40.230> and<00:00:40.820> probably<00:00:41.820> about<00:00:42.060> a<00:00:42.420> I'm

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
the top and probably about a I'm

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.160 
the top and probably about a I'm
guessing<00:00:43.920> about<00:00:44.040> a<00:00:44.220> sixty<00:00:44.790> degree<00:00:44.910> angle

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:45.170 
guessing about a sixty degree angle

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:49.340 
guessing about a sixty degree angle
going<00:00:46.170> down<00:00:46.470> to<00:00:46.890> a<00:00:46.920> flat<00:00:47.340> area<00:00:47.970> with<00:00:48.270> a<00:00:48.480> stream

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
going down to a flat area with a stream

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.150 
going down to a flat area with a stream
at<00:00:49.590> the<00:00:49.710> base<00:00:49.920> of<00:00:50.480> the<00:00:51.480> mountain<00:00:52.050> and<00:00:52.590> the

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
at the base of the mountain and the

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.250 
at the base of the mountain and the
rocks<00:00:53.550> are<00:00:53.820> basically<00:00:54.210> basically<00:00:54.960> going<00:00:55.170> to

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
rocks are basically basically going to

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.990 
rocks are basically basically going to
represent<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:55.980> stream<00:00:56.310> and<00:00:56.580> of<00:00:56.670> course<00:00:56.910> I'm

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
represent the stream and of course I'm

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.560 
represent the stream and of course I'm
going<00:00:57.090> to<00:00:57.150> draw<00:00:57.390> some<00:00:57.420> stuff<00:00:57.960> in<00:00:58.230> and<00:00:59.300> some<00:01:00.300> in

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
going to draw some stuff in and some in

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.830 
going to draw some stuff in and some in
the<00:01:00.690> pictures<00:01:01.170> and<00:01:02.180> the<00:01:03.180> little<00:01:03.450> mound<00:01:03.630> of

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
the pictures and the little mound of

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.289 
the pictures and the little mound of
dirt<00:01:04.129> actually<00:01:05.129> would<00:01:05.280> represent<00:01:05.700> the

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
dirt actually would represent the

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.499 
dirt actually would represent the
mountain<00:01:06.920> now<00:01:07.920> what<00:01:08.159> happened<00:01:08.609> was<00:01:08.759> over<00:01:08.789> time

00:01:09.499 --> 00:01:09.509 
mountain now what happened was over time

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:13.789 
mountain now what happened was over time
the<00:01:10.140> river<00:01:10.710> started<00:01:11.340> to<00:01:11.520> erode<00:01:12.149> a<00:01:12.600> section<00:01:13.590> of

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
the river started to erode a section of

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.959 
the river started to erode a section of
the<00:01:13.979> mountain<00:01:14.159> away<00:01:14.700> and<00:01:15.689> it<00:01:16.789> doesn't<00:01:17.789> take

00:01:17.959 --> 00:01:17.969 
the mountain away and it doesn't take

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:20.630 
the mountain away and it doesn't take
much<00:01:18.210> for<00:01:18.270> a<00:01:18.509> river<00:01:18.810> to<00:01:19.049> do<00:01:19.229> this<00:01:19.469> in<00:01:20.159> some

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
much for a river to do this in some

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.149 
much for a river to do this in some
cases<00:01:20.969> all<00:01:21.390> depends<00:01:21.869> on<00:01:21.960> the<00:01:22.170> soil<00:01:22.380> conditions

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
cases all depends on the soil conditions

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.620 
cases all depends on the soil conditions
the<00:01:23.399> river<00:01:24.619> the<00:01:25.619> plants<00:01:26.130> all<00:01:26.880> sorts<00:01:27.270> of<00:01:27.390> things

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
the river the plants all sorts of things

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.660 
the river the plants all sorts of things
but<00:01:27.840> the<00:01:27.990> water<00:01:28.200> can<00:01:28.469> actually<00:01:28.619> undermine<00:01:29.369> a

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
but the water can actually undermine a

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.209 
but the water can actually undermine a
hill<00:01:29.939> or<00:01:30.179> a<00:01:30.869> mountain<00:01:31.020> and<00:01:31.590> then<00:01:31.799> eventually

00:01:32.209 --> 00:01:32.219 
hill or a mountain and then eventually

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:34.999 
hill or a mountain and then eventually
move<00:01:32.850> in<00:01:33.179> you<00:01:33.990> know<00:01:34.049> you<00:01:34.229> can<00:01:34.380> see<00:01:34.560> I<00:01:34.590> kind<00:01:34.829> of

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
move in you know you can see I kind of

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.349 
move in you know you can see I kind of
took<00:01:35.189> a<00:01:35.249> little<00:01:35.369> dirt<00:01:35.759> away<00:01:35.909> from<00:01:36.090> the

00:01:36.349 --> 00:01:36.359 
took a little dirt away from the

00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:40.209 
took a little dirt away from the
mountain<00:01:36.869> showing<00:01:37.799> the<00:01:37.950> erosion<00:01:38.819> and<00:01:39.090> the

00:01:40.209 --> 00:01:40.219 
mountain showing the erosion and the

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:43.580 
mountain showing the erosion and the
river<00:01:41.219> could<00:01:41.490> actually<00:01:41.700> just<00:01:42.329> keep<00:01:42.780> working

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
river could actually just keep working

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.520 
river could actually just keep working
its<00:01:43.799> way<00:01:44.069> in<00:01:44.399> to<00:01:44.969> the<00:01:45.450> mountain<00:01:45.659> and<00:01:46.139> it<00:01:46.380> would

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
its way in to the mountain and it would

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.749 
its way in to the mountain and it would
eventually<00:01:48.380> erode<00:01:49.380> enough<00:01:50.009> of<00:01:50.249> the<00:01:50.399> mountain

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
eventually erode enough of the mountain

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.779 
eventually erode enough of the mountain
to<00:01:50.939> cause<00:01:51.119> the<00:01:51.359> house<00:01:51.569> to<00:01:51.840> fall<00:01:52.079> down<00:01:52.380> if<00:01:52.889> there

00:01:53.779 --> 00:01:53.789 
to cause the house to fall down if there

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:56.359 
to cause the house to fall down if there
isn't<00:01:54.359> anything<00:01:54.719> done<00:01:55.319> and<00:01:55.619> like<00:01:55.709> I<00:01:55.889> said<00:01:56.130> over

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
isn't anything done and like I said over

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.330 
isn't anything done and like I said over
time<00:01:56.789> this<00:01:57.090> could<00:01:57.359> be<00:01:57.630> ten<00:01:58.380> years<00:01:58.409> it<00:01:58.920> could<00:01:59.100> be

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
time this could be ten years it could be

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.999 
time this could be ten years it could be
50<00:01:59.789> years<00:02:00.060> but<00:02:00.389> either<00:02:00.959> way<00:02:01.259> it's<00:02:01.439> a<00:02:01.529> problem

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
50 years but either way it's a problem

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.279 
50 years but either way it's a problem
that<00:02:02.159> should<00:02:02.399> be<00:02:02.459> addressed<00:02:02.880> if<00:02:03.420> you<00:02:03.689> have<00:02:03.959> a

00:02:04.279 --> 00:02:04.289 
that should be addressed if you have a

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:08.059 
that should be addressed if you have a
home<00:02:04.560> with<00:02:04.950> a<00:02:05.340> river<00:02:05.719> some<00:02:06.719> type<00:02:06.899> of<00:02:06.929> body<00:02:07.859> of

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
home with a river some type of body of

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.910 
home with a river some type of body of
water<00:02:08.399> that<00:02:08.789> seems<00:02:09.659> to<00:02:09.869> keep<00:02:10.019> taking<00:02:10.500> a<00:02:10.619> little

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
water that seems to keep taking a little

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.970 
water that seems to keep taking a little
bit<00:02:11.250> of<00:02:11.549> your<00:02:11.849> Mountain<00:02:12.439> away<00:02:13.439> on

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
bit of your Mountain away on

five<00:03:22.049> feet<00:03:22.319> wide<00:03:22.590> you<00:03:23.010> know<00:03:23.099> obviously<00:03:23.639> you

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
five feet wide you know obviously you

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.569 
five feet wide you know obviously you
wouldn't<00:03:24.180> be<00:03:24.359> doing<00:03:24.690> this<00:03:24.900> with<00:03:25.560> a<00:03:25.590> river<00:03:26.130> that

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:26.579 
wouldn't be doing this with a river that

is moving fast and is you know let's
just<00:03:31.919> say<00:03:32.099> it's<00:03:32.370> 20<00:03:33.090> feet<00:03:33.269> wide<00:03:33.569> obviously

that<00:04:07.650> obviously<00:04:07.769> this<00:04:08.280> would<00:04:08.459> make<00:04:08.609> the<00:04:08.730> job

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
that obviously this would make the job

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.390 
that obviously this would make the job
easier<00:04:09.450> and<00:04:09.540> you<00:04:10.169> could<00:04:10.319> do<00:04:10.410> it<00:04:10.440> a<00:04:10.560> lot<00:04:10.709> faster

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
easier and you could do it a lot faster

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:14.240 
easier and you could do it a lot faster
that<00:04:11.810> would<00:04:12.810> be<00:04:13.019> that<00:04:13.379> would<00:04:13.470> be<00:04:13.500> a<00:04:13.650> really<00:04:14.099> a

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250 
that would be that would be a really a

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:15.379 
that would be that would be a really a
good<00:04:14.459> way<00:04:14.579> to<00:04:14.639> go<00:04:14.819> if<00:04:14.910> you<00:04:15.000> could<00:04:15.120> get<00:04:15.269> the

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:15.389 
good way to go if you could get the

00:04:15.389 --> 00:04:16.849 
good way to go if you could get the
equipment<00:04:15.840> out<00:04:15.930> there<00:04:15.989> and<00:04:16.349> of<00:04:16.470> course<00:04:16.680> had

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:16.859 
equipment out there and of course had

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:19.580 
equipment out there and of course had
the<00:04:16.889> money<00:04:17.190> to<00:04:17.280> do<00:04:17.579> that<00:04:17.900> now<00:04:18.900> the<00:04:18.989> next<00:04:19.139> thing

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:19.590 
the money to do that now the next thing

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:21.979 
the money to do that now the next thing
you're<00:04:19.709> gonna<00:04:19.829> need<00:04:20.099> to<00:04:20.250> do<00:04:20.370> after<00:04:20.729> you<00:04:21.000> move

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:21.989 
you're gonna need to do after you move

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:25.520 
you're gonna need to do after you move
the<00:04:22.469> stream<00:04:23.280> will<00:04:23.909> be<00:04:24.150> to<00:04:24.419> start<00:04:24.750> back<00:04:25.140> filling

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:25.530 
the stream will be to start back filling

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:27.500 
the stream will be to start back filling
this<00:04:25.919> area<00:04:26.460> with<00:04:26.729> something

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:27.510 
this area with something

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:30.230 
this area with something
and<00:04:27.630> again<00:04:28.470> I'm<00:04:28.650> not<00:04:28.770> a<00:04:28.830> soil<00:04:29.190> engineer<00:04:29.520> I<00:04:29.970> just

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:30.240 
and again I'm not a soil engineer I just

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:33.050 
and again I'm not a soil engineer I just
made<00:04:30.420> this<00:04:30.600> video<00:04:31.520> to<00:04:32.520> see<00:04:32.670> if<00:04:32.700> I<00:04:32.880> could

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:33.060 
made this video to see if I could

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:35.450 
made this video to see if I could
provide<00:04:33.330> them<00:04:33.570> with<00:04:33.750> some<00:04:33.990> assistance<00:04:34.460> you

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:35.460 
provide them with some assistance you

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:37.090 
provide them with some assistance you
might<00:04:35.700> need<00:04:35.910> to<00:04:36.120> get<00:04:36.240> some<00:04:36.480> more<00:04:36.660> information

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:37.100 
might need to get some more information

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:40.700 
might need to get some more information
and<00:04:38.100> again<00:04:38.850> I<00:04:38.880> suggest<00:04:39.210> that<00:04:39.630> you<00:04:39.840> do<00:04:40.080> you<00:04:40.620> know

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:40.710 
and again I suggest that you do you know

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:43.160 
and again I suggest that you do you know
this<00:04:40.890> is<00:04:41.070> just<00:04:41.190> kind<00:04:41.460> of<00:04:41.520> a<00:04:41.670> basic<00:04:42.360> idea<00:04:42.900> of

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:43.170 
this is just kind of a basic idea of

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:44.810 
this is just kind of a basic idea of
what<00:04:43.200> to<00:04:43.620> do<00:04:43.800> here<00:04:44.130> and<00:04:44.250> I<00:04:44.340> couldn't<00:04:44.580> find

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:44.820 
what to do here and I couldn't find

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:47.360 
what to do here and I couldn't find
another<00:04:45.090> video<00:04:45.530> that<00:04:46.530> I<00:04:46.860> could<00:04:47.130> have<00:04:47.250> even

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:47.370 
another video that I could have even

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:50.000 
another video that I could have even
sent<00:04:47.820> you<00:04:48.060> so<00:04:48.630> I<00:04:48.930> couldn't<00:04:49.170> i<00:04:49.290> typed<00:04:49.620> in<00:04:49.800> how<00:04:49.950> to

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:50.010 
sent you so I couldn't i typed in how to

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:52.870 
sent you so I couldn't i typed in how to
move<00:04:50.220> a<00:04:50.340> river<00:04:50.580> and<00:04:50.790> there<00:04:50.910> was<00:04:51.060> nothing<00:04:51.630> so

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:52.880 
move a river and there was nothing so

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:55.490 
move a river and there was nothing so
but<00:04:53.880> you<00:04:54.000> will<00:04:54.150> need<00:04:54.360> to<00:04:54.480> backfill<00:04:54.930> the<00:04:55.110> area

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:55.500 
but you will need to backfill the area

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:56.870 
but you will need to backfill the area
and<00:04:55.680> of<00:04:55.740> course<00:04:55.980> I<00:04:56.100> would<00:04:56.160> suggest<00:04:56.430> to

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:56.880 
and of course I would suggest to

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:59.480 
and of course I would suggest to
backfill<00:04:57.390> it<00:04:57.600> with<00:04:57.630> dirt<00:04:58.620> or<00:04:58.920> whatever<00:04:59.310> you're

00:04:59.480 --> 00:04:59.490 
backfill it with dirt or whatever you're

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:02.180 
backfill it with dirt or whatever you're
going<00:04:59.640> to<00:04:59.730> use<00:04:59.850> my<00:05:00.660> you<00:05:00.720> know<00:05:00.990> if<00:05:01.890> you're<00:05:02.070> gonna

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:02.190 
going to use my you know if you're gonna

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:04.340 
going to use my you know if you're gonna
do<00:05:02.430> it<00:05:02.460> yourself<00:05:02.700> could<00:05:03.420> you<00:05:03.450> just<00:05:03.780> move<00:05:04.020> some

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:04.350 
do it yourself could you just move some

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:06.020 
do it yourself could you just move some
dirt<00:05:04.590> and<00:05:04.830> start<00:05:05.070> throwing<00:05:05.280> it<00:05:05.520> over<00:05:05.760> the<00:05:05.850> hill

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:06.030 
dirt and start throwing it over the hill

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:09.470 
dirt and start throwing it over the hill
you<00:05:06.510> know<00:05:06.540> I<00:05:06.630> think<00:05:06.750> you<00:05:07.200> could<00:05:08.360> you<00:05:09.360> would

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:09.480 
you know I think you could you would

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:12.050 
you know I think you could you would
just<00:05:09.660> have<00:05:09.810> to<00:05:09.840> watch<00:05:10.170> it<00:05:10.200> and<00:05:10.940> you<00:05:11.940> know

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:12.060 
just have to watch it and you know

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:13.780 
just have to watch it and you know
obviously<00:05:12.480> some<00:05:12.810> type<00:05:13.020> of<00:05:13.050> a<00:05:13.290> fill<00:05:13.560> material

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:13.790 
obviously some type of a fill material

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:16.970 
obviously some type of a fill material
gravel<00:05:14.790> would<00:05:15.030> work<00:05:15.240> better<00:05:15.540> but<00:05:15.990> again<00:05:16.830> it

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:16.980 
gravel would work better but again it

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:18.710 
gravel would work better but again it
goes<00:05:17.100> back<00:05:17.160> to<00:05:17.490> how<00:05:17.580> much<00:05:17.760> money<00:05:18.030> you<00:05:18.210> have<00:05:18.240> if

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:18.720 
goes back to how much money you have if

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:21.370 
goes back to how much money you have if
you're<00:05:18.990> you<00:05:19.680> know<00:05:19.800> if<00:05:20.010> you<00:05:20.160> can<00:05:20.370> move<00:05:20.640> the

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:21.380 
you're you know if you can move the

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:24.890 
you're you know if you can move the
creek<00:05:22.380> first<00:05:23.340> you<00:05:24.000> know<00:05:24.150> and<00:05:24.180> that's<00:05:24.720> gonna

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:24.900 
creek first you know and that's gonna

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:26.480 
creek first you know and that's gonna
take<00:05:25.140> you<00:05:25.350> a<00:05:25.380> year<00:05:25.500> or<00:05:25.770> something<00:05:26.280> like<00:05:26.430> that

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:26.490 
take you a year or something like that

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:27.950 
take you a year or something like that
then<00:05:26.940> obviously<00:05:27.060> it's<00:05:27.510> gonna<00:05:27.630> take<00:05:27.840> you<00:05:27.930> some

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:27.960 
then obviously it's gonna take you some

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:30.050 
then obviously it's gonna take you some
time<00:05:28.350> to<00:05:28.380> backfill<00:05:28.950> the<00:05:29.250> area<00:05:29.640> but<00:05:29.760> at<00:05:29.910> least

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:30.060 
time to backfill the area but at least

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:32.570 
time to backfill the area but at least
you're<00:05:30.420> you're<00:05:31.290> pulling<00:05:31.890> some<00:05:32.130> of<00:05:32.250> the<00:05:32.310> water

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:32.580 
you're you're pulling some of the water

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:35.180 
you're you're pulling some of the water
away<00:05:32.850> you're<00:05:33.210> going<00:05:33.360> to<00:05:33.710> prevent<00:05:34.710> the<00:05:34.920> erosion

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:35.190 
away you're going to prevent the erosion

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:37.640 
away you're going to prevent the erosion
or<00:05:35.610> prevent<00:05:36.000> the<00:05:36.090> problem<00:05:36.510> from<00:05:36.650> getting

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:37.650 
or prevent the problem from getting

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:39.410 
or prevent the problem from getting
worse<00:05:37.980> so<00:05:38.460> if<00:05:38.610> you<00:05:38.730> don't<00:05:38.880> got<00:05:39.000> very<00:05:39.210> much

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:39.420 
worse so if you don't got very much

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:42.590 
worse so if you don't got very much
money<00:05:39.920> move<00:05:40.920> the<00:05:41.100> creek<00:05:41.340> first<00:05:41.700> and<00:05:42.030> then

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:42.600 
money move the creek first and then

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:45.440 
money move the creek first and then
start<00:05:43.530> filling<00:05:43.710> the<00:05:44.010> area<00:05:44.220> later<00:05:44.880> and<00:05:45.240> that's

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:45.450 
start filling the area later and that's

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:47.720 
start filling the area later and that's
about<00:05:45.660> all<00:05:45.840> I<00:05:45.870> got<00:05:46.020> for<00:05:46.590> this<00:05:46.950> and<00:05:47.280> I<00:05:47.370> hope<00:05:47.580> it

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:47.730 
about all I got for this and I hope it

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:50.420 
about all I got for this and I hope it
helps<00:05:48.000> if<00:05:48.270> it<00:05:48.390> does<00:05:48.920> hit<00:05:49.920> me<00:05:50.070> with<00:05:50.220> the<00:05:50.310> old

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:50.430 
helps if it does hit me with the old

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:53.390
