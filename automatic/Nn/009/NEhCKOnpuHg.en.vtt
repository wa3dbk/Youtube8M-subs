00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:07.740
 hello friends how good this video is going 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:11.910
 to be brief going let's talk about how 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:15.660
 install the twv rp recovery to the motorola 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:18.240
 motokey xt 10 32 this method is very 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:21.270
 effective for this we must already have 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.930
 the bootloader unlocked but good 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.930
 let's proceed 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:28.640
 first of all we have to download 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:30.620
 the file that I'm going to leave in the 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:37.300
 description of the video 

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:37.300
 is this flyer twv rp recovery once 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:44.079
 that we have unpacked this file 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:46.690
 We will see all these 

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:49.890
 records 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:49.890
 except for this 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.030
 and we go straight to our motorcycle 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.560
 gp 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:01:00.790
 we are going to 

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:00.790
 let's turn it off 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:08.610
 to be able to enter facebook mode 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:11.420
 you know new fast boot button 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:15.020
 off on and off volume less 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:19.409
 we were squeezing about 45 seconds 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:20.460
 and let's go here we are already in fast mode 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.890
 boot 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:27.409
 we will enter 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.409
 let's connect it to the computer 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.200
 for this we must have the drivers 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:38.490
 installed 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:41.670
 well now we are going to 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:47.060
 open a command window this is 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:47.060
 makes pressing the shift key 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:55.490
 the right click 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.490
 this option will appear 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:04.440
 but it did not come out again we're going to give 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:07.250
 here it is and we are going to give it to open 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:08.660
 command window 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:12.230
 now 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:14.750
 here we are going to write a command in this 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:16.550
 part of here I already have it copied I'm going 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:19.880
 to paste 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:24.320
 but let's put it 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:28.790
 the command fast good flash recovery 

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:32.890
 recovery point and mg anyway the 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:35.890
 command is already in the rare file in a 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:40.530
 in a notes file after we go to 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:40.530
 give him enter and he will start the process 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:45.000
 and ready 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:45.000
 It is done 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:52.430
 now we go to the motorcycle g 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:55.870
 we disconnected 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:59.709
 and we go down to where it says recovery 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:03.269
 with the volume minus there is and when 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:03.269
 the most volume we select 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.360
 will start 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:23.750
 and there we have twv erp recovery the 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:27.220
 truth is that it is very useful I like it to me 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:27.220
 personally I like more what 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:33.019
 cw m recovery clockwork mount because 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:35.720
 here so good we have the tows 

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:38.720
 available and nothing to use the 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:42.579
 good buttons that would be all friends and 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:42.579
