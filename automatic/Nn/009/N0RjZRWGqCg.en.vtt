just like that and now I'm going to let
this<00:02:48.630> hair<00:02:48.840> down<00:02:49.190> now<00:02:50.190> this<00:02:50.400> makes<00:02:50.640> a<00:02:50.820> pretty

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
this hair down now this makes a pretty

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.630 
this hair down now this makes a pretty
good<00:02:51.060> hairstyle<00:02:51.330> on<00:02:51.720> its<00:02:51.810> own<00:02:51.930> so<00:02:52.620> you<00:02:53.490> can

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
good hairstyle on its own so you can

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.790 
good hairstyle on its own so you can
just<00:02:53.820> wear<00:02:53.970> it<00:02:54.000> like<00:02:54.120> this<00:02:54.240> and<00:02:54.660> have<00:02:54.900> it<00:02:55.140> be<00:02:55.590> a

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 
just wear it like this and have it be a

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:59.180 
just wear it like this and have it be a
little<00:02:56.150> braided<00:02:57.150> headband<00:02:57.600> but<00:02:57.930> I<00:02:58.140> prefer<00:02:58.980> the

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
little braided headband but I prefer the

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.150 
little braided headband but I prefer the
other<00:02:59.490> method<00:03:00.000> because<00:03:00.180> it's<00:03:00.330> just<00:03:00.480> like<00:03:00.570> a

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:01.160 
other method because it's just like a
