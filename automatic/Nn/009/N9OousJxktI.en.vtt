00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:43.180 
really nice features of the at2020 are

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:45.420 
really nice features of the at2020 are
that<00:01:43.510> it<00:01:43.690> does<00:01:43.930> have<00:01:43.960> noise<00:01:44.530> cancelling<00:01:45.190> and

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:45.430 
that it does have noise cancelling and

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:48.660 
that it does have noise cancelling and
also<00:01:46.150> it<00:01:46.360> sounds<00:01:46.690> really<00:01:47.140> clear<00:01:47.710> and<00:01:47.920> natural
