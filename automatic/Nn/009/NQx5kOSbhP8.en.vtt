00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
functionality that you get from a

functionality that you get from a
jailbroken<00:00:34.559> phone<00:00:34.800> I<00:00:35.219> think<00:00:35.820> apples<00:00:36.270> kind<00:00:36.420> of

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
jailbroken phone I think apples kind of

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:37.850 
jailbroken phone I think apples kind of
purposely<00:00:36.809> doing<00:00:37.050> it<00:00:37.230> kind<00:00:37.380> of<00:00:37.410> snub<00:00:37.710> out

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
jailbreaker it's a little bit it allows

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:40.639

you<00:00:39.600> to<00:00:39.690> kind<00:00:39.809> of<00:00:39.930> theme<00:00:40.140> your<00:00:40.350> device<00:00:40.620> a

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
you to kind of theme your device a

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.330 
you to kind of theme your device a
little<00:00:41.040> bit<00:00:41.270> background<00:00:42.270> multitasking<00:00:43.170> a<00:00:43.890> lot

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
little bit background multitasking a lot

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.240

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
start making apps because it kind of has

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.770 
start making apps because it kind of has
a<00:00:58.500> different<00:00:58.859> framework<00:00:59.420> but<00:01:00.420> other<00:01:00.660> than

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
a different framework but other than

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.529 
a different framework but other than
that<00:01:00.930> guys<00:01:01.350> I<00:01:02.190> wouldn't<00:01:02.789> be<00:01:02.969> dig<00:01:03.149> around<00:01:03.270> the

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
that guys I wouldn't be dig around the

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.119 
that guys I wouldn't be dig around the
internet<00:01:03.870> to<00:01:04.019> try<00:01:04.229> and<00:01:04.320> download<00:01:04.500> and<00:01:04.830> install

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
internet to try and download and install

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:06.200 
internet to try and download and install
I<00:01:05.189> guess<00:01:05.430> you<00:01:05.519> have<00:01:05.610> to<00:01:05.640> have<00:01:05.790> a<00:01:05.850> dev<00:01:06.060> account

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
I guess you have to have a dev account

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.090 
I guess you have to have a dev account
to<00:01:06.540> do<00:01:06.689> it<00:01:06.840> and<00:01:07.020> if<00:01:07.409> you<00:01:07.530> have<00:01:07.710> a<00:01:07.740> dev<00:01:07.979> account

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
to do it and if you have a dev account

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.260 
to do it and if you have a dev account
you<00:01:08.369> can<00:01:08.460> just<00:01:08.670> download<00:01:08.790> it<00:01:09.000> right<00:01:09.150> from

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
you can just download it right from

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.170 
you can just download it right from
Apple<00:01:09.689> so<00:01:10.530> I<00:01:10.560> wouldn't<00:01:11.100> be<00:01:11.369> trying<00:01:11.760> to<00:01:11.939> do<00:01:12.150> a

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
Apple so I wouldn't be trying to do a

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.179 
Apple so I wouldn't be trying to do a
pirated<00:01:12.780> or<00:01:13.020> illegal<00:01:13.500> because<00:01:13.710> it's<00:01:14.040> really

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
pirated or illegal because it's really

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.640 
pirated or illegal because it's really
difficult<00:01:14.630> unless<00:01:15.630> you're<00:01:15.900> a<00:01:15.930> developer<00:01:16.229> and

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
difficult unless you're a developer and

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.249 
difficult unless you're a developer and
there<00:01:17.189> actually<00:01:17.340> is<00:01:17.729> a<00:01:18.030> jailbreak<00:01:18.659> right<00:01:19.140> now

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
there actually is a jailbreak right now

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.410 
there actually is a jailbreak right now
there's<00:01:19.500> an<00:01:19.590> exploit<00:01:20.100> for<00:01:20.130> it<00:01:20.430> well<00:01:21.150> we<00:01:21.299> don't

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
there's an exploit for it well we don't

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.719 
there's an exploit for it well we don't
know<00:01:21.540> that<00:01:21.570> for<00:01:21.720> sure<00:01:21.869> but<00:01:22.290> muscle<00:01:23.100> nerd<00:01:23.460> one

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
know that for sure but muscle nerd one

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.010 
know that for sure but muscle nerd one
of<00:01:23.820> the<00:01:23.880> members<00:01:24.060> of<00:01:24.180> the<00:01:24.360> iphone<00:01:24.630> dev<00:01:24.780> team

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
of the members of the iphone dev team

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.570 
of the members of the iphone dev team
kind<00:01:25.259> of<00:01:25.320> hinted<00:01:25.650> to<00:01:25.770> it<00:01:25.890> on<00:01:26.009> twitter<00:01:26.310> that<00:01:26.549> he

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
kind of hinted to it on twitter that he

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.999 
kind of hinted to it on twitter that he
has<00:01:26.970> a<00:01:27.000> exploit<00:01:27.750> for<00:01:27.780> 4.2<00:01:29.810> jailbreak<00:01:31.009> which

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
has a exploit for 4.2 jailbreak which

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.069 
has a exploit for 4.2 jailbreak which
but<00:01:32.340> that's<00:01:32.520> also<00:01:32.670> kind<00:01:32.939> of<00:01:33.000> bad<00:01:33.150> so<00:01:33.570> that

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
but that's also kind of bad so that

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.050 
but that's also kind of bad so that
means<00:01:34.650> that<00:01:34.860> there<00:01:35.189> won't<00:01:35.340> be<00:01:35.520> a<00:01:35.549> jailbreak

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
means that there won't be a jailbreak

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.940 
means that there won't be a jailbreak
until<00:01:36.630> four<00:01:36.900> point<00:01:37.140> oh<00:01:37.259> comes<00:01:37.470> out<00:01:37.650> probably

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
until four point oh comes out probably

I'm<00:04:19.919> also<00:04:20.130> hoping<00:04:20.519> with<00:04:21.000> the<00:04:21.090> next<00:04:21.329> iphone<00:04:21.630> 4

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810 
I'm also hoping with the next iphone 4

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:23.630 
I'm also hoping with the next iphone 4
to<00:04:21.900> have<00:04:22.019> a<00:04:22.049> forward<00:04:22.440> facing<00:04:22.590> camera<00:04:23.010> much

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:23.640 
to have a forward facing camera much

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:26.250 
to have a forward facing camera much
faster<00:04:24.060> processor<00:04:24.690> than<00:04:24.719> the<00:04:24.990> iphone<00:04:25.289> 3gs

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:26.260 
faster processor than the iphone 3gs

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.170 
faster processor than the iphone 3gs
I<00:04:26.650> would<00:04:27.010> hope<00:04:27.190> I<00:04:27.400> would<00:04:27.430> like<00:04:27.670> it<00:04:27.850> to<00:04:28.030> be

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:28.180 
I would hope I would like it to be

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:32.040 
I would hope I would like it to be
thinner<00:04:29.050> than<00:04:29.590> the<00:04:29.740> iphone<00:04:30.070> 3g<00:04:30.550> and<00:04:30.850> 3gs<00:04:31.050> right

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:32.050 
thinner than the iphone 3g and 3gs right

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:34.470 
thinner than the iphone 3g and 3gs right
now<00:04:32.320> but<00:04:33.280> I'm<00:04:33.430> kind<00:04:33.460> of<00:04:33.730> doubting<00:04:33.940> that<00:04:34.120> I'm

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:34.480 
now but I'm kind of doubting that I'm

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:36.060 
now but I'm kind of doubting that I'm
thinking<00:04:35.050> I'm<00:04:35.290> probably<00:04:35.470> about<00:04:35.680> the<00:04:35.860> same

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:36.070 
thinking I'm probably about the same

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:38.100 
thinking I'm probably about the same
thickness<00:04:36.400> but<00:04:37.390> it<00:04:37.510> should<00:04:37.660> have<00:04:37.810> a<00:04:37.840> bigger

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:38.110 
thickness but it should have a bigger

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:39.750 
thickness but it should have a bigger
screen<00:04:38.620> or<00:04:38.950> at<00:04:39.070> least<00:04:39.250> a<00:04:39.370> higher<00:04:39.520> resolution

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:39.760 
screen or at least a higher resolution

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:42.450 
screen or at least a higher resolution
screen<00:04:40.240> and<00:04:40.870> it<00:04:41.800> should<00:04:41.980> have<00:04:42.100> a<00:04:42.130> lot<00:04:42.340> more

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:42.460 
screen and it should have a lot more

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:44.610 
screen and it should have a lot more
functionality<00:04:43.180> now<00:04:43.360> I<00:04:43.600> think<00:04:44.110> because<00:04:44.290> they

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:44.620 
functionality now I think because they

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:46.620 
functionality now I think because they
got<00:04:44.740> to<00:04:44.890> really<00:04:45.040> keep<00:04:45.280> up<00:04:45.430> with<00:04:45.640> HTC<00:04:46.300> and

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:46.630 
got to really keep up with HTC and

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:48.630 
got to really keep up with HTC and
android<00:04:47.110> and<00:04:47.710> google<00:04:47.740> and<00:04:48.280> all<00:04:48.400> these<00:04:48.520> other
