wow<00:00:36.050> you<00:00:37.050> guys<00:00:37.230> maybe<00:00:37.740> read<00:00:38.010> that<00:00:38.190> off<00:00:38.340> on

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
wow you guys maybe read that off on

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:04.420 
I think it's the same that's what I

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:06.300 
I think it's the same that's what I

10 amp current limit I'm now guessing
that<00:02:15.099> should<00:02:15.790> be<00:02:15.940> twice<00:02:16.209> the<00:02:16.239> torque<00:02:16.890> because

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
that should be twice the torque because

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:32.820 
that should be twice the torque because
it<00:02:18.069> was<00:02:18.930> twice<00:02:19.930> the<00:02:19.959> amps

you<00:02:40.390> take<00:02:40.600> me<00:02:40.780> gag<00:02:41.790> just<00:02:42.790> 24<00:02:43.740> volts<00:02:44.740> of<00:02:47.640> 10m

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
you take me gag just 24 volts of 10m

you take me gag just 24 volts of 10m

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.690 

what<00:03:03.810> the<00:03:03.989> same<00:03:04.230> as<00:03:04.409> it<00:03:04.530> was<00:03:04.650> before<00:03:04.680> I'm<00:03:05.549> going

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
what the same as it was before I'm going

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:09.830 
what the same as it was before I'm going
to<00:03:05.760> trust<00:03:05.969> it<00:03:06.180> it's<00:03:06.359> the<00:03:06.480> same<00:03:06.689> 436<00:03:07.409> also<00:03:07.739> in<00:03:08.840> 48

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
to trust it it's the same 436 also in 48

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.059 
to trust it it's the same 436 also in 48
and<00:03:09.870> 60<00:03:10.219> so<00:03:11.219> it's<00:03:11.250> the<00:03:11.549> same<00:03:11.909> torque<00:03:12.980> for<00:03:13.980> a

00:03:14.059 --> 00:03:14.069 
and 60 so it's the same torque for a

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:23.229 
and 60 so it's the same torque for a
given<00:03:14.280> current<00:03:14.700> limit<00:03:17.780> just<00:03:18.780> yeah<00:03:19.469> okay
