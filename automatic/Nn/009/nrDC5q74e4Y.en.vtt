 all the part of mobile sebastián which 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:48.020
 they are or what they get are the 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:50.720
 main characteristics of choose 2 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:53.630
 good the main one is the design today in 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:55.580
 day the design is ergonomically made 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:57.140
 for the palm of his hand what was coming 

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:59.900
 making smartphones or computers 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:03.170
 the consumer threw it is not looking 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:06.080
 the button taking the picture did not fit 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:09.800
 in the palm in belts the design is 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:12.500
 exclusively on 5.2 inches in the 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:15.410
 screen and it's made so you can 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:17.720
 One-hand operation of the telephone 

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:19.880
 you can write you can take pictures or 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:22.490
 you can this is good to be doing 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:25.070
 anything the second point is the 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:27.810
 camera the 3 megapixel camera is what 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:30.740
 that allows to be 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:33.840
 It is designed on the computer perfectly 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:35.850
 is thin so that a bong does not come out 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.280
 like conventional cameras the 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.590
 camera allows you to take pictures in 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.680
 movement which is new is a 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:46.380
 stabilizer that has the equipment and is 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:49.049
 done as if it were the human eye not you 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.390
 you see an image does not distort you 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:54.600
 move is fixed is what is going to be the 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:56.700
 phone keeps that stability another 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.009
 important point is the processor 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:03.899
 we include a 2.6 process 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:05.909
 gigabytes with snapdragon 800 and is a 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:09.420
 valence that we have with qualcomm and what 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:11.099
 which allows us to handle speed not 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.959
 get your music be sending 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:15.269
 messages be on the internet 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:18.180
 talking at the same time and you can 

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:22.290
 manage the city's phone without 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:24.390
 that is broken and another point well they are 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:27.030
 the user experience that has 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.980
 other features that we will be 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.870
 talking on social networks about this 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.730
 We will be launching videos in Mexico 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:35.940
 let's be in touch with consumer 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:38.549
 on facebook twitter and then any 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.500
 doubt that they come within our 

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:42.510
 Dr. yí page there we can 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.560
 explain what would be the date 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:48.269
 launch of this equipment to our 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:49.500
 country we are talking about yet date 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:50.670
 we are defining dates but 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.349
 we calculate that at the end of October 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:54.930
 early November will be 

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:56.880
 available in Mexico the carré not yet 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.489
 is defined could be with the three 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.700
 more important if you consider us 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:02.950
 carriers 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:06.069
 both telcel movistar iusacell unefon 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:08.890
 we still do not have a fight, everything is a 

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:10.900
 possibility everything is a possibility but 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:13.480
 sure we will have it by the end of 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:15.879
 October early November another 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:17.620
 point that also draws attention 

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:20.709
 when with this equipment is the subject of 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:23.050
 optimus what happens with optimus stays or 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:24.580
 the word goes inside the line 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:27.040
 mobile phones 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:28.990
 optimus is the family see how well you say 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:31.300
 lg smartphones 

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:34.240
 We are working here as products 

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:37.570
 high- end in this case so that 2 

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:38.890
 going to be removed is going to be the gym g22 this with 

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:41.020
 the purpose that the user can 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:43.510
 identify in a better way our 

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:46.210
 new family of high- end products 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:48.280
 on smartphones but not only for 

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:50.260
 be high-end is price is expensive we are 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:53.320
 talking about technology we have better 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:55.240
 technology against competition and that 

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:57.460
 is going to be part of this then it's going to 

00:03:55.240 --> 00:04:01.240
 look like the gym 

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:03.910
 and finally of these equipments that is if 

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:05.650
 we see that there is at most the event a 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:07.900
 with an important comparison against the 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:09.340
 competition you think they're going to 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:12.070
 to do in Mexico in Mexico we are a little 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:13.600
 more susceptible but you think we see 

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:15.340
 this battle for phones 

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:17.350
 intelligent we go to you that 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:19.960
 we are good and we send ourselves 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:22.570

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:26.530
 in Mexico we are as leaders 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:31.630
 We are talking about market figures 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:34.750
 double zero this and well then that's the 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:38.950
 people are migrating us towards 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:42.550

 throw hehe but also nexus not 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:52.390
 then let's say we are in the mind 

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:53.950
 of the consumer in both familiarity and 

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:55.690
