that<00:04:03.000> frame<00:04:03.270> I've<00:04:03.420> been<00:04:03.750> teased<00:04:04.050> whip<00:04:04.380> up<00:04:04.560> a

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
that frame I've been teased whip up a

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:08.690 
that frame I've been teased whip up a
little<00:04:04.770> bit<00:04:05.209> another<00:04:06.650> point<00:04:07.650> if<00:04:08.100> we<00:04:08.370> can<00:04:08.550> get

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:08.700 
little bit another point if we can get

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:14.930 
little bit another point if we can get
it<00:04:08.790> to<00:04:08.940> focus<00:04:12.620> there<00:04:13.620> we<00:04:13.740> go<00:04:13.950> I've<00:04:14.459> put<00:04:14.790> two

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:14.940 
it to focus there we go I've put two

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:16.340 
it to focus there we go I've put two
Marines<00:04:15.180> head<00:04:15.390> in<00:04:15.510> there<00:04:15.660> I<00:04:15.690> even<00:04:15.780> tried<00:04:16.200> to

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:16.350 
Marines head in there I even tried to

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:19.820 
Marines head in there I even tried to
green<00:04:16.620> stuff<00:04:16.890> a<00:04:16.980> little<00:04:17.220> bit<00:04:17.370> of<00:04:17.459> a<00:04:18.830> brain

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:19.830 
green stuff a little bit of a brain

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:23.060 
green stuff a little bit of a brain
matter<00:04:20.280> in<00:04:20.459> there<00:04:20.790> I<00:04:21.109> might<00:04:22.109> see<00:04:22.380> the<00:04:22.530> knots<00:04:22.800> in

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:23.070 
matter in there I might see the knots in

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:24.440 
matter in there I might see the knots in
it<00:04:23.160> to<00:04:23.340> make<00:04:23.370> it<00:04:23.520> look<00:04:23.760> like<00:04:23.910> brain<00:04:24.240> I<00:04:24.420> don't

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:24.450 
it to make it look like brain I don't

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:27.590 
it to make it look like brain I don't
know<00:04:24.780> and<00:04:25.140> I've<00:04:25.890> drilled<00:04:26.670> a<00:04:26.850> hole<00:04:26.880> out<00:04:27.120> of<00:04:27.390> the

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 
know and I've drilled a hole out of the

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:30.020 
know and I've drilled a hole out of the
I<00:04:27.750> am<00:04:28.080> cut<00:04:28.740> one<00:04:28.860> of<00:04:28.950> the<00:04:29.040> spikes<00:04:29.370> off<00:04:29.669> the<00:04:29.820> bits

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:30.030 
I am cut one of the spikes off the bits

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:32.659 
I am cut one of the spikes off the bits
that's<00:04:30.210> covered<00:04:30.540> by<00:04:30.570> the<00:04:30.720> helmet<00:04:31.229> and<00:04:31.410> I<00:04:31.950> put

00:04:32.659 --> 00:04:32.669 
that's covered by the helmet and I put

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:34.610 
that's covered by the helmet and I put
the<00:04:32.790> spike<00:04:33.120> coming<00:04:33.570> through<00:04:33.840> the<00:04:33.960> helmet<00:04:34.290> will

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:34.620 
the spike coming through the helmet will

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:37.370 
the spike coming through the helmet will
or<00:04:34.680> dodgy<00:04:35.070> camera<00:04:35.550> worthless<00:04:35.940> about<00:04:36.389> that<00:04:36.720> so

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:37.380 
or dodgy camera worthless about that so

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:39.620 
or dodgy camera worthless about that so
he's<00:04:37.919> got<00:04:38.190> literally<00:04:38.550> a<00:04:38.669> spike<00:04:39.000> poking<00:04:39.510> out

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:39.630 
he's got literally a spike poking out

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:41.750 
he's got literally a spike poking out
his<00:04:39.810> eye<00:04:39.900> so<00:04:40.139> it's<00:04:40.229> pretty<00:04:40.470> gruesome<00:04:40.680> and<00:04:41.550> I'm

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:41.760 
his eye so it's pretty gruesome and I'm

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:48.110 
his eye so it's pretty gruesome and I'm
hoping<00:04:42.180> to<00:04:42.360> have<00:04:42.510> some<00:04:45.350> tacky<00:04:46.580> blood<00:04:47.580> dripping

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:48.120 
hoping to have some tacky blood dripping

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:49.939 
hoping to have some tacky blood dripping
down<00:04:48.330> from<00:04:48.720> the<00:04:48.840> helmet<00:04:49.290> straight<00:04:49.650> to<00:04:49.830> the

00:04:49.939 --> 00:04:49.949 
down from the helmet straight to the

00:04:49.949 --> 00:04:53.090 
down from the helmet straight to the
base<00:04:50.160> there<00:04:51.229> so<00:04:52.229> that<00:04:52.410> should<00:04:52.710> look<00:04:52.830> quite

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:53.100 
base there so that should look quite

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:55.340 
base there so that should look quite
cool<00:04:53.340> so<00:04:53.580> I'm<00:04:53.639> going<00:04:53.790> to<00:04:53.850> have<00:04:54.120> a<00:04:54.150> go<00:04:55.080> over<00:04:55.229> that

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:55.350 
cool so I'm going to have a go over that

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:57.800 
cool so I'm going to have a go over that

the tip brush to get rid of the pain

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:38.750 
the tip brush to get rid of the pain
particularly<00:05:37.710> the<00:05:37.889> primer<00:05:38.190> from<00:05:38.400> the<00:05:38.580> mini

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:44.390 
don't run it under water at all for the
simple<00:05:43.560> reason<00:05:43.590> is<00:05:43.889> you're<00:05:44.010> scrubbing<00:05:44.220> it

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:44.400 
simple reason is you're scrubbing it

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:46.250 
simple reason is you're scrubbing it
with<00:05:44.430> a<00:05:44.550> toothbrush<00:05:44.910> if<00:05:45.150> it's<00:05:45.419> not<00:05:45.720> if<00:05:46.200> the

fully what you'll do you'll start

modelling all clump up and it'll turn
into<00:05:56.010> like<00:05:56.130> a<00:05:56.160> gloopy<00:05:56.669> mess<00:05:56.960> you<00:05:57.960> need<00:05:58.200> to

miniature and if you actually struggle
doing<00:06:29.250> that<00:06:29.460> then<00:06:29.910> it's<00:06:30.060> basically<00:06:30.599> needs<00:06:30.900> to

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:31.080 
doing that then it's basically needs to

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:32.900 
doing that then it's basically needs to
stay<00:06:31.320> in<00:06:31.349> the<00:06:31.740> air<00:06:32.010> depth<00:06:32.250> for<00:06:32.550> you<00:06:32.789> know

stay in the air depth for you know
another<00:06:33.300> few<00:06:34.139> hours<00:06:34.500> I<00:06:35.160> mean<00:06:35.490> it<00:06:35.550> doesn't<00:06:35.699> harm

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:35.940 
another few hours I mean it doesn't harm

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:37.279 
another few hours I mean it doesn't harm
to<00:06:36.210> leave<00:06:36.389> them<00:06:36.570> in<00:06:36.690> there<00:06:36.870> for<00:06:36.900> a<00:06:37.050> day<00:06:37.229> two

00:06:37.279 --> 00:06:37.289 
to leave them in there for a day two

00:06:37.289 --> 00:06:40.159 
to leave them in there for a day two
days<00:06:37.770> three<00:06:37.800> days<00:06:38.240> so<00:06:39.240> but<00:06:39.780> what<00:06:40.020> I<00:06:40.050> would

00:06:40.159 --> 00:06:40.169 
days three days so but what I would

00:06:40.169 --> 00:06:42.980 
days three days so but what I would
recommend<00:06:40.860> though<00:06:41.039> is<00:06:41.250> between<00:06:42.240> leaving<00:06:42.479> is

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:42.990 
recommend though is between leaving is

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:44.899 
recommend though is between leaving is
taking<00:06:43.469> out<00:06:43.650> give<00:06:44.039> it<00:06:44.070> a<00:06:44.159> good<00:06:44.280> old<00:06:44.370> brushing

00:06:44.899 --> 00:06:44.909 
taking out give it a good old brushing

00:06:44.909 --> 00:06:46.640 
taking out give it a good old brushing

of one layer of pay at a time depending

00:06:58.920 --> 00:06:59.990 
of one layer of pay at a time depending
on<00:06:59.010> the<00:06:59.160> miniature<00:06:59.490> there<00:06:59.640> might<00:06:59.730> be<00:06:59.790> more

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:00.000 
on the miniature there might be more

on the miniature there might be more
than<00:07:00.210> one<00:07:00.360> layer<00:07:00.570> so<00:07:00.870> it's<00:07:01.530> a<00:07:01.560> case<00:07:01.740> of<00:07:02.070> taking
