diameter<00:00:31.599> that<00:00:32.599> will<00:00:32.899> require<00:00:33.200> for<00:00:34.010> me<00:00:34.070> to<00:00:34.190> use

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:34.370 
diameter that will require for me to use

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:38.160 
diameter that will require for me to use
a<00:00:34.399> number<00:00:34.879> 3<00:00:35.120> crimp<00:00:35.449> bead<00:00:36.579> the<00:00:37.579> crimp<00:00:37.879> bead

a number 3 crimp bead the crimp bead

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:43.989 
a number 3 crimp bead the crimp bead
needs<00:00:39.170> to<00:00:39.440> be<00:00:39.620> mashed<00:00:40.280> into<00:00:41.269> an<00:00:41.569> oval<00:00:42.940> so<00:00:43.940> you

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:43.999 
needs to be mashed into an oval so you

00:00:43.999 --> 00:00:46.889 
needs to be mashed into an oval so you
simply<00:00:44.390> place<00:00:44.780> the<00:00:45.050> the<00:00:45.440> crimp<00:00:45.679> bead<00:00:45.710> into<00:00:46.129> it

00:00:46.889 --> 00:00:46.899 
simply place the the crimp bead into it

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:49.599 
simply place the the crimp bead into it

00:00:49.599 --> 00:00:49.609 
I'm using a curved chain nose you could

00:00:49.609 --> 00:00:51.910 
I'm using a curved chain nose you could
use<00:00:49.729> a<00:00:49.760> regular<00:00:49.999> chain<00:00:50.390> nose<00:00:50.600> and<00:00:50.899> just<00:00:51.620> mash

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:51.920 
use a regular chain nose and just mash

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.250 
use a regular chain nose and just mash
it<00:00:51.949> so<00:00:52.640> that<00:00:52.819> you<00:00:52.909> get<00:00:53.030> a<00:00:53.089> nice<00:00:53.300> oval<00:00:53.809> out<00:00:53.989> of<00:00:54.140> it

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:54.260 
it so that you get a nice oval out of it

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.680 
it so that you get a nice oval out of it
you<00:00:55.069> want<00:00:55.249> to<00:00:55.309> be<00:00:55.399> able<00:00:55.489> to<00:00:55.609> allow<00:00:55.969> for<00:00:56.479> at

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:56.690 
you want to be able to allow for at

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:01.259 
you want to be able to allow for at

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:16.690 
inches of wire so I'm going to cut that

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:21.850 
inches of wire so I'm going to cut that
and<00:01:17.980> then<00:01:18.980> I<00:01:19.130> have<00:01:19.450> some<00:01:20.450> cut<00:01:20.720> already<00:01:21.080> you

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:21.860

and then I have some cut already you
want<00:01:22.040> to<00:01:22.130> lay<00:01:22.280> the<00:01:22.310> strands<00:01:22.940> next<00:01:23.510> to<00:01:23.600> one

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:23.780 
want to lay the strands next to one

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:28.240 
want to lay the strands next to one
another<00:01:24.790> flat<00:01:25.790> and<00:01:26.620> with<00:01:27.620> the<00:01:27.740> curvature<00:01:27.980> of

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:28.250 
another flat and with the curvature of

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:30.810 
another flat and with the curvature of
the<00:01:28.460> wire<00:01:28.870> going<00:01:29.870> in<00:01:30.050> the<00:01:30.110> natural<00:01:30.470> position

the wire going in the natural position

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:32.920 
the wire going in the natural position
then<00:01:31.820> you're<00:01:31.940> going<00:01:32.060> to<00:01:32.120> slide<00:01:32.420> the<00:01:32.690> crimp

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:32.930 
then you're going to slide the crimp

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:37.660 
then you're going to slide the crimp
bead<00:01:33.170> that's<00:01:33.920> been<00:01:34.160> mashed<00:01:34.430> on<00:01:35.770> and<00:01:36.770> then

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:37.670 
bead that's been mashed on and then

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:41.340 
bead that's been mashed on and then
you're<00:01:37.820> going<00:01:38.000> to<00:01:39.250> give<00:01:40.250> yourself<00:01:40.580> some<00:01:40.610> room

you're going to give yourself some room
at<00:01:42.350> the<00:01:42.560> end<00:01:42.710> and<00:01:43.390> then<00:01:44.390> mash<00:01:44.660> that<00:01:44.900> down

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:45.200 
at the end and then mash that down

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.570 
at the end and then mash that down
securely

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:48.580 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:52.610 

if<00:01:49.060> you're<00:01:49.330> adding<00:01:49.690> beads<00:01:50.880> to<00:01:51.880> your<00:01:52.000> bracelet

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:52.620 
if you're adding beads to your bracelet

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:54.930 
if you're adding beads to your bracelet
you<00:01:53.620> need<00:01:53.800> to<00:01:53.890> make<00:01:54.040> sure<00:01:54.070> that<00:01:54.550> the<00:01:54.700> two

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:54.940 
you need to make sure that the two

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:58.560 
you need to make sure that the two
strands<00:01:56.070> will<00:01:57.070> fit<00:01:57.340> into<00:01:57.610> the<00:01:58.180> hole<00:01:58.360> of<00:01:58.390> the

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:58.570 
strands will fit into the hole of the

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:07.380 
strands will fit into the hole of the
bead<00:02:03.330> just<00:02:04.330> like<00:02:04.600> the<00:02:04.690> two<00:02:04.810> strands<00:02:05.110> in<00:02:06.390> down

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:07.390 
bead just like the two strands in down

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:09.480 
bead just like the two strands in down
and<00:02:08.350> then<00:02:08.500> your<00:02:08.650> third<00:02:08.800> strand<00:02:09.160> will<00:02:09.340> go

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:09.490 
and then your third strand will go

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:13.140 
and then your third strand will go
around<00:02:09.910> the<00:02:10.210> bead<00:02:11.400> it's<00:02:12.400> important<00:02:12.850> to<00:02:12.940> hold

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
around the bead it's important to hold

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.930 
around the bead it's important to hold
these<00:02:13.360> flat<00:02:13.840> once<00:02:14.200> again<00:02:14.560> and<00:02:14.890> slide<00:02:15.580> up<00:02:15.790> to

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
these flat once again and slide up to

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.440 
these flat once again and slide up to
the<00:02:16.030> end<00:02:16.210> and<00:02:17.190> on<00:02:18.190> goes<00:02:18.580> another<00:02:18.910> one<00:02:19.180> of<00:02:19.330> the

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
the end and on goes another one of the

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:29.410 
the end and on goes another one of the
mashed<00:02:20.760> crimp<00:02:21.760> beads<00:02:24.210> just<00:02:25.210> like<00:02:25.480> this<00:02:25.660> down

wires<00:02:41.239> and<00:02:42.400> once<00:02:43.400> again<00:02:43.580> slide<00:02:44.180> on<00:02:44.650> the<00:02:45.650> bead

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.850 

and<00:02:51.599> then<00:02:52.599> the<00:02:52.720> third<00:02:52.900> strand<00:02:53.260> will<00:02:53.470> go<00:02:53.620> around

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:53.860 
and then the third strand will go around

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:56.430 
and then the third strand will go around
on<00:02:54.160> the<00:02:54.310> opposite<00:02:54.790> side<00:02:55.060> this<00:02:55.840> side<00:02:56.080> then<00:02:56.410> that

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440 
on the opposite side this side then that

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:00.600 
on the opposite side this side then that
side<00:02:57.000> you<00:02:58.019> alternate<00:02:59.019> that<00:02:59.280> for<00:03:00.280> the<00:03:00.370> length

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:00.610 
side you alternate that for the length

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:04.110 
side you alternate that for the length
of<00:03:00.849> the<00:03:01.060> bracelet<00:03:02.040> again<00:03:03.040> slide<00:03:03.430> on<00:03:03.640> the<00:03:03.849> three

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.059 

and<00:03:14.490> judge<00:03:15.490> the<00:03:15.700> distance<00:03:16.030> or<00:03:16.270> measure<00:03:16.540> it<00:03:16.660> and

00:03:17.059 --> 00:03:17.069 
and judge the distance or measure it and

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:23.420 
and judge the distance or measure it and
mash<00:03:20.760> em<00:03:21.760> continue<00:03:22.630> the<00:03:22.750> pattern<00:03:22.959> alternating

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:26.890 
the two strand first on one side than

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:28.920 
the two strand first on one side than
the<00:03:27.010> other<00:03:27.040> until<00:03:27.910> you<00:03:27.970> get<00:03:28.209> approximately<00:03:28.750> to

don't<00:03:31.480> crimp<00:03:31.930> the<00:03:32.200> last<00:03:32.440> one<00:03:32.910> this<00:03:33.910> one<00:03:34.120> we're

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:34.270 
don't crimp the last one this one we're

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:36.990 
don't crimp the last one this one we're
going<00:03:34.360> to<00:03:34.450> have<00:03:34.630> to<00:03:34.780> put<00:03:35.590> all<00:03:35.800> of<00:03:35.830> the<00:03:36.100> crimp<00:03:36.370> of

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.000 
going to have to put all of the crimp of

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.160 
going to have to put all of the crimp of
the<00:03:37.150> wires<00:03:37.360> into<00:03:37.690> a<00:03:37.870> non<00:03:38.440> mashed<00:03:39.160> crimp<00:03:39.640> bead

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:42.720 
the wires into a non mashed crimp bead
so<00:03:41.170> we're<00:03:41.410> going<00:03:41.500> to<00:03:41.560> slide<00:03:41.800> these<00:03:42.070> three<00:03:42.520> on

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:42.730 
so we're going to slide these three on

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:48.240 
so we're going to slide these three on
this<00:03:43.030> side<00:03:45.540> and<00:03:46.560> try<00:03:47.560> to<00:03:47.620> keep<00:03:47.800> them<00:03:47.950> as<00:03:48.100> flat

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.250 
this side and try to keep them as flat

this side and try to keep them as flat
as<00:03:48.520> possible<00:03:49.090> and<00:03:49.330> then<00:03:50.080> these<00:03:50.380> three<00:03:50.770> will<00:03:50.920> go

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:51.070 
as possible and then these three will go

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:52.830 
as possible and then these three will go
on<00:03:51.160> this<00:03:51.340> side<00:03:51.400> and<00:03:51.850> if<00:03:51.910> they<00:03:52.150> don't<00:03:52.330> all<00:03:52.510> fit

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:52.840

which<00:03:53.709> sometimes<00:03:54.190> occurs<00:03:54.640> you<00:03:55.510> may<00:03:55.720> have<00:03:56.019> to

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:56.200 
which sometimes occurs you may have to

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:03.390 
which sometimes occurs you may have to
move<00:03:56.410> to<00:03:56.640> the<00:03:57.640> number<00:03:59.700> four<00:04:00.700> crimp<00:04:01.410> tube<00:04:02.410> to

move to the number four crimp tube to

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:07.050 
move to the number four crimp tube to
finish<00:04:03.820> this<00:04:04.000> off<00:04:04.920> because<00:04:05.920> the<00:04:06.550> wires<00:04:06.820> are

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:07.060 
finish this off because the wires are

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:08.940 
finish this off because the wires are
too<00:04:07.120> large<00:04:07.510> this<00:04:08.350> would<00:04:08.500> be<00:04:08.620> one<00:04:08.739> of<00:04:08.769> those

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:08.950 
too large this would be one of those

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:10.949 
too large this would be one of those
times<00:04:09.489> when<00:04:09.820> you<00:04:09.910> would<00:04:10.030> want<00:04:10.269> to<00:04:10.450> use<00:04:10.720> a

00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:10.959 
times when you would want to use a

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:13.140 
times when you would want to use a
little<00:04:11.410> smaller<00:04:11.739> diameter<00:04:12.310> wire<00:04:12.489> or<00:04:12.790> just<00:04:12.820> go

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:13.150 
little smaller diameter wire or just go

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:15.360 
little smaller diameter wire or just go
to<00:04:13.209> a<00:04:13.300> crimp<00:04:13.630> tube<00:04:13.720> which<00:04:14.709> has<00:04:14.739> a<00:04:14.950> slightly

larger diameter for the number four and

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:34.310 
larger diameter for the number four and
then<00:04:20.470> push<00:04:20.979> these<00:04:21.190> wires<00:04:21.519> in

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:39.120 
they're a little bit tight you can use

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:42.320 
they're a little bit tight you can use
the<00:04:39.300> pliers<00:04:39.510> to<00:04:39.870> pull<00:04:40.940> holding<00:04:41.940> onto<00:04:42.090> the
