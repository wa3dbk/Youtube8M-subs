so we don't need to go off buying

you<00:02:07.170> go<00:02:07.290> into<00:02:07.439> hit<00:02:07.860> points<00:02:08.280> it<00:02:08.789> puts<00:02:09.179> all<00:02:09.390> the

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
you go into hit points it puts all the

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.010 
you go into hit points it puts all the
hit<00:02:09.629> points<00:02:10.050> in<00:02:10.229> for<00:02:10.770> you<00:02:11.599> then<00:02:12.599> what<00:02:12.750> you<00:02:12.870> want

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
hit points in for you then what you want

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.580 
hit points in for you then what you want
to<00:02:13.110> adjust

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
to adjust

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.800 
to adjust
is<00:02:13.800> the<00:02:14.099> threshold<00:02:14.610> you<00:02:14.970> can<00:02:15.000> see<00:02:15.300> these<00:02:15.510> lines

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
is the threshold you can see these lines

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:22.600 
is the threshold you can see these lines
here<00:02:17.120> and<00:02:18.120> that<00:02:18.330> shows<00:02:18.720> you<00:02:19.640> the<00:02:20.640> hit<00:02:20.819> points

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
here and that shows you the hit points

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:26.390 
here and that shows you the hit points
that<00:02:23.610> it<00:02:23.880> will<00:02:24.090> gather<00:02:24.660> up<00:02:24.950> so<00:02:25.950> as<00:02:26.099> you<00:02:26.220> reduce

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
that it will gather up so as you reduce

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.360 
that it will gather up so as you reduce
the<00:02:26.819> threshold<00:02:27.170> it<00:02:28.170> begins<00:02:28.590> to<00:02:28.950> put<00:02:29.160> those

the threshold it begins to put those

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.229 
the threshold it begins to put those
slices<00:02:30.209> in<00:02:30.390> for<00:02:30.750> you<00:02:31.550> and<00:02:32.550> at<00:02:32.670> the<00:02:32.760> point<00:02:33.060> when

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:33.239 
slices in for you and at the point when

slices in for you and at the point when
you've<00:02:33.390> got<00:02:33.630> down<00:02:33.900> and<00:02:34.230> you<00:02:34.410> think<00:02:34.440> you've

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
you've got down and you think you've

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.120 
you've got down and you think you've
gathered<00:02:35.459> up<00:02:35.610> all<00:02:35.959> those<00:02:36.959> MIDI<00:02:37.560> notes<00:02:37.860> that

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
gathered up all those MIDI notes that

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:41.839 
gathered up all those MIDI notes that
you<00:02:38.280> want<00:02:38.310> and<00:02:39.269> you<00:02:40.080> can<00:02:40.260> see<00:02:40.640> it's<00:02:41.640> pretty

00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:41.849 
you want and you can see it's pretty

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:43.640 
you want and you can see it's pretty
much<00:02:42.000> cuttable<00:02:42.480> the<00:02:42.810> place<00:02:43.019> to<00:02:43.230> watch<00:02:43.410> is

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
much cuttable the place to watch is

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.530 
much cuttable the place to watch is
where<00:02:43.800> you<00:02:43.890> get<00:02:44.069> multiple<00:02:44.519> notes<00:02:44.790> together<00:02:45.060> or

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
where you get multiple notes together or

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:50.240 
where you get multiple notes together or
occasionally<00:02:46.290> quiet<00:02:46.590> notes<00:02:48.260> you<00:02:49.260> can<00:02:49.290> do<00:02:50.220> a

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
occasionally quiet notes you can do a

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.789 
occasionally quiet notes you can do a
number<00:02:50.489> of<00:02:50.670> things<00:02:50.940> you<00:02:51.120> can<00:02:51.330> slice<00:02:51.600> it<00:02:51.630> up<00:02:52.019> you

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:52.799 
number of things you can slice it up you

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:55.550 
number of things you can slice it up you
can<00:02:52.980> create<00:02:53.220> a<00:02:53.340> groove<00:02:53.730> groove<00:02:54.660> quantizing<00:02:55.470> is

series of videos but the important thing
for<00:02:59.760> us<00:02:59.880> is<00:03:00.120> to<00:03:00.480> create<00:03:00.810> MIDI<00:03:01.319> notes<00:03:01.620> and<00:03:03.470> you

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
for us is to create MIDI notes and you

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:07.789 
for us is to create MIDI notes and you
can<00:03:04.620> either<00:03:04.819> fix<00:03:05.819> the<00:03:06.000> velocity<00:03:06.540> or<00:03:06.750> you<00:03:07.620> can

00:03:07.789 --> 00:03:07.799 
can either fix the velocity or you can

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:09.850 
can either fix the velocity or you can
have<00:03:07.980> dynamic<00:03:08.280> velocity<00:03:09.120> based<00:03:09.360> on<00:03:09.690> the

velocity of the original notes you pick

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:17.270

the<00:03:13.980> pitch<00:03:14.250> that<00:03:14.549> you<00:03:14.700> want<00:03:15.500> the<00:03:16.500> length<00:03:17.010> of

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
the pitch that you want the length of

the pitch that you want the length of
the<00:03:17.400> MIDI<00:03:17.579> notes<00:03:17.820> that<00:03:18.090> it<00:03:18.180> will<00:03:18.329> create<00:03:18.510> and

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
the MIDI notes that it will create and

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:22.009 
the MIDI notes that it will create and
where<00:03:19.350> you're<00:03:19.440> going<00:03:19.560> to<00:03:19.680> put<00:03:19.920> them<00:03:21.019> generally

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:22.019 
where you're going to put them generally

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:24.680 
where you're going to put them generally
I'd<00:03:22.590> go<00:03:22.920> for<00:03:23.100> a<00:03:23.130> new<00:03:23.340> MIDI<00:03:23.609> track<00:03:23.640> and<00:03:24.180> in<00:03:24.570> this

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
I'd go for a new MIDI track and in this

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:28.640 
I'd go for a new MIDI track and in this
case<00:03:24.959> we<00:03:25.200> know<00:03:25.410> that<00:03:25.650> the<00:03:25.950> kick<00:03:26.190> drum<00:03:26.459> is<00:03:26.670> c1<00:03:27.650> so

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
case we know that the kick drum is c1 so

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:30.319 
case we know that the kick drum is c1 so
we'll<00:03:28.829> extract<00:03:29.069> that<00:03:29.489> to<00:03:29.819> a<00:03:29.850> new<00:03:30.090> MIDI<00:03:30.299> track

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:30.329 
we'll extract that to a new MIDI track

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:35.599 
we'll extract that to a new MIDI track
and<00:03:30.569> we<00:03:31.109> click<00:03:31.319> OK<00:03:33.560> if<00:03:34.560> we<00:03:34.709> just<00:03:34.920> come<00:03:35.190> out

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:35.609 
and we click OK if we just come out

00:03:35.609 --> 00:03:38.270 
and we click OK if we just come out
we<00:03:36.540> should<00:03:36.750> scroll<00:03:37.049> down<00:03:37.319> now<00:03:37.620> and<00:03:37.799> find<00:03:38.100> here

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
we should scroll down now and find here

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.849 
we should scroll down now and find here
we<00:03:38.459> have<00:03:38.609> a<00:03:38.640> kick<00:03:38.940> MIDI<00:03:39.299> at<00:03:39.810> the<00:03:40.049> bottom<00:03:40.380> of<00:03:40.680> our

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:40.859 
we have a kick MIDI at the bottom of our

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:44.030 
we have a kick MIDI at the bottom of our
screen<00:03:40.920> and<00:03:41.810> we<00:03:42.810> just<00:03:43.019> opened<00:03:43.410> that<00:03:43.500> up<00:03:43.560> you'll

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
screen and we just opened that up you'll

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.160 
screen and we just opened that up you'll
see<00:03:44.250> that<00:03:44.370> we<00:03:44.489> have<00:03:44.519> a<00:03:44.670> whole<00:03:44.880> bunch<00:03:45.120> of<00:03:45.329> hit

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170 
see that we have a whole bunch of hit

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:50.680 
see that we have a whole bunch of hit
points<00:03:46.200> have<00:03:46.950> been<00:03:47.100> assigned<00:03:47.400> for<00:03:47.819> us

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:50.690 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:53.980 

you<00:03:51.530> can<00:03:51.740> of<00:03:51.830> course<00:03:51.860> map<00:03:52.400> this<00:03:52.810> now<00:03:53.810> what<00:03:53.960> I

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:53.990 
you can of course map this now what I

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:57.310 
you can of course map this now what I
did<00:03:54.350> was<00:03:55.010> I<00:03:55.370> did<00:03:55.850> that<00:03:56.300> process<00:03:56.810> for<00:03:57.020> the<00:03:57.080> kick

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:57.320 
did was I did that process for the kick

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:02.290 
did was I did that process for the kick
and<00:03:57.530> the<00:03:57.590> snare<00:03:58.280> and<00:03:59.110> then<00:04:00.110> I<00:04:00.290> copied<00:04:01.150> one<00:04:02.150> up

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:02.300 
and the snare and then I copied one up

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:05.550 
and the snare and then I copied one up
on<00:04:02.480> top<00:04:02.690> of<00:04:02.840> the<00:04:02.960> other

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:05.560 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:09.810 

like<00:04:06.560> that<00:04:07.030> and<00:04:08.030> simply<00:04:08.450> glued<00:04:08.690> them<00:04:08.870> together

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:09.820 
like that and simply glued them together

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:14.020 
like that and simply glued them together
using<00:04:10.820> the<00:04:11.120> glue<00:04:11.300> tool<00:04:12.490> I'm<00:04:13.490> not<00:04:13.670> going<00:04:13.850> to<00:04:13.910> do

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:14.030 
using the glue tool I'm not going to do

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:17.680 
using the glue tool I'm not going to do
that<00:04:14.210> here<00:04:14.480> because<00:04:14.720> I<00:04:16.180> don't<00:04:17.180> want<00:04:17.390> to<00:04:17.600> upset

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:17.690 
that here because I don't want to upset

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:24.010 
that here because I don't want to upset
my<00:04:19.570> pre-arranged<00:04:20.570> MIDI<00:04:21.290> track<00:04:22.840> and<00:04:23.840> we'll

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:24.020 
my pre-arranged MIDI track and we'll

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:27.640 
my pre-arranged MIDI track and we'll
just<00:04:24.170> delete<00:04:24.350> that<00:04:24.650> all<00:04:24.860> together<00:04:26.260> go<00:04:27.260> back<00:04:27.440> to

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:27.650 
just delete that all together go back to

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:31.390

was<00:04:49.310> unsympathetic<00:04:49.910> to<00:04:50.570> that<00:04:51.670> so<00:04:52.670> having

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:52.850 
was unsympathetic to that so having

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:55.030 
was unsympathetic to that so having
glued<00:04:53.180> the<00:04:53.360> two<00:04:53.390> parts<00:04:53.990> together<00:04:54.200> what<00:04:55.010> I

glued the two parts together what I

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:58.300 
glued the two parts together what I
ended<00:04:55.370> up<00:04:55.460> with<00:04:55.760> was<00:04:56.660> this<00:04:56.840> and<00:04:57.260> as<00:04:58.010> you<00:04:58.190> can

ez drummer one of the things you'll
notice<00:05:41.480> is<00:05:41.840> that<00:05:41.960> it's<00:05:42.230> only<00:05:42.410> using<00:05:42.650> 54<00:05:43.610> Meg<00:05:43.850> of

using the ez drummer or a similar
sampler<00:06:02.030> it's<00:06:02.630> worth<00:06:02.870> looking<00:06:03.140> at<00:06:03.440> how<00:06:03.590> you

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:06.540 
can minimize the amount of samples it

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:08.990 
can minimize the amount of samples it
loads<00:06:06.750> into<00:06:07.080> memory<00:06:07.440> but<00:06:08.160> here<00:06:08.490> we've<00:06:08.700> got<00:06:08.880> the

sound in the original recording as I'd

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:41.390 
sound in the original recording as I'd
mix<00:06:39.540> them<00:06:39.780> and<00:06:40.440> then<00:06:40.620> I'm<00:06:40.710> going<00:06:40.890> to<00:06:41.010> add<00:06:41.190> in

00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:41.400 
mix them and then I'm going to add in

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:44.180 
mix them and then I'm going to add in
the<00:06:42.030> kick<00:06:42.240> and<00:06:42.420> snare<00:06:42.660> from<00:06:43.530> the<00:06:43.680> Americana

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:44.190 
the kick and snare from the Americana

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:46.730 
the kick and snare from the Americana
kit<00:06:44.520> it<00:06:45.270> gives<00:06:45.510> them<00:06:45.690> a<00:06:45.840> little<00:06:46.080> bit<00:06:46.200> of<00:06:46.230> edge<00:06:46.440> a

00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:46.740 
kit it gives them a little bit of edge a

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:49.100 
kit it gives them a little bit of edge a
little<00:06:47.130> bit<00:06:47.250> of<00:06:47.370> beef<00:06:47.580> and<00:06:48.360> I<00:06:48.750> think<00:06:48.960> you'll

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:49.110 
little bit of beef and I think you'll

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:53.360 
little bit of beef and I think you'll
see<00:06:49.290> the<00:06:49.440> difference<00:06:49.860> and<00:06:51.080> so<00:06:52.080> with<00:06:52.860> that<00:06:53.040> I'll

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:53.370 
see the difference and so with that I'll
