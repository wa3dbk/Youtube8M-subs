00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.340 
pilot project back in the spring and so
we<00:00:21.150> talked<00:00:21.390> about<00:00:21.510> different<00:00:21.660> angles<00:00:22.260> and

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
we talked about different angles and

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:23.779 
we talked about different angles and
what<00:00:22.500> we<00:00:22.619> were<00:00:22.710> going<00:00:22.830> to<00:00:22.890> use<00:00:23.189> and<00:00:23.369> we<00:00:23.460> decided

what we were going to use and we decided

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.070 
what we were going to use and we decided

envelope<00:00:30.090> in<00:00:30.390> Sylvania<00:00:30.630> the<00:00:31.289> sheep<00:00:31.529> are<00:00:31.740> here

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
envelope in Sylvania the sheep are here

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.880 
envelope in Sylvania the sheep are here
to<00:00:32.489> keep<00:00:32.969> the<00:00:33.210> vegetation<00:00:33.930> under<00:00:34.110> control<00:00:34.710> so

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
to keep the vegetation under control so

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.590 
to keep the vegetation under control so
that<00:00:35.010> we<00:00:35.100> don't<00:00:35.219> have<00:00:35.340> to<00:00:35.610> send<00:00:35.820> mowers<00:00:36.329> out

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
that we don't have to send mowers out

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.410 
that we don't have to send mowers out
mowers<00:00:37.170> have<00:00:37.469> big<00:00:37.770> wheels<00:00:38.280> so<00:00:39.210> the<00:00:39.390> mower<00:00:39.629> will

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:41.420 
mowers have big wheels so the mower will

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.479 
mowers have big wheels so the mower will
compact<00:00:42.420> the<00:00:42.750> basin<00:00:43.290> and<00:00:43.530> that<00:00:44.100> makes<00:00:44.370> it

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
compact the basin and that makes it

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.299 
compact the basin and that makes it
perform<00:00:44.969> less<00:00:45.180> efficiently<00:00:45.930> because<00:00:46.559> you

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
perform less efficiently because you

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.220 
perform less efficiently because you
can't<00:00:47.550> infiltrate<00:00:48.149> it<00:00:48.239> as<00:00:48.300> easily<00:00:48.629> after

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
can't infiltrate it as easily after

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.799 
can't infiltrate it as easily after
you've<00:00:49.469> noted<00:00:49.890> a<00:00:49.950> few<00:00:50.160> times<00:00:50.460> the<00:00:51.329> sheep<00:00:51.600> on

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
you've noted a few times the sheep on

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.350 
you've noted a few times the sheep on
the<00:00:51.960> other<00:00:52.140> hand<00:00:52.530> will<00:00:53.190> have<00:00:53.370> less<00:00:53.610> impact<00:00:53.820> on

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
the other hand will have less impact on

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:00.709 
the other hand will have less impact on
that<00:00:54.620> their<00:00:56.059> natural<00:00:57.059> mowers<00:00:59.539> I've<00:01:00.539> been

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
that their natural mowers I've been

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.540 
that their natural mowers I've been

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
there and this Basin is meant to capture

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:14.840 
there and this Basin is meant to capture
the<00:01:13.799> storm<00:01:14.100> water<00:01:14.280> coming<00:01:14.700> off<00:01:14.790> the

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
the storm water coming off the

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.520 
the storm water coming off the
neighborhoods<00:01:15.479> and<00:01:15.630> keep<00:01:15.869> it<00:01:15.990> from<00:01:16.140> rushing

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
neighborhoods and keep it from rushing

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.260 
neighborhoods and keep it from rushing
into<00:01:16.680> the<00:01:16.890> stream<00:01:17.189> so<00:01:17.430> fast<00:01:17.700> and<00:01:17.970> causing

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
into the stream so fast and causing

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.480 
into the stream so fast and causing
damage<00:01:18.420> so<00:01:19.020> what<00:01:19.170> I<00:01:19.200> came<00:01:19.470> up<00:01:19.650> with<00:01:19.680> was<00:01:20.100> to<00:01:20.250> put

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
damage so what I came up with was to put

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.510 
damage so what I came up with was to put
a<00:01:20.520> sampler<00:01:21.180> on<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:22.080> inlet<00:01:22.560> to<00:01:22.710> the<00:01:22.740> basin<00:01:23.280> and

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
a sampler on the inlet to the basin and

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.249 
a sampler on the inlet to the basin and
on<00:01:23.640> the<00:01:23.820> outlet<00:01:24.180> so<00:01:24.420> I<00:01:24.450> sampled<00:01:24.990> the<00:01:25.080> water

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
on the outlet so I sampled the water

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.800 
on the outlet so I sampled the water
coming<00:01:25.650> in<00:01:25.799> from<00:01:25.830> the<00:01:26.220> neighborhoods<00:01:26.810> it

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
coming in from the neighborhoods it

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.510 
coming in from the neighborhoods it
crosses<00:01:28.409> the<00:01:28.530> basin<00:01:28.920> and<00:01:29.070> goes<00:01:29.159> out<00:01:29.340> the

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
crosses the basin and goes out the

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.429 
crosses the basin and goes out the
outlet<00:01:29.880> i<00:01:30.030> sample<00:01:30.509> the<00:01:30.540> outlet<00:01:30.990> I<00:01:31.170> get<00:01:31.409> a

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
outlet i sample the outlet I get a

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.310 
outlet i sample the outlet I get a
before<00:01:31.650> and<00:01:31.950> after

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:33.320 
before and after

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:35.410 
before and after
if<00:01:33.800> this<00:01:34.100> takes<00:01:34.370> off<00:01:34.640> then<00:01:34.910> I<00:01:35.000> think<00:01:35.210> more

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:35.420 
if this takes off then I think more

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.100 
if this takes off then I think more
people<00:01:35.450> will<00:01:35.840> be<00:01:36.020> willing<00:01:36.050> to<00:01:36.500> use<00:01:36.680> sheep

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:38.110 
people will be willing to use sheep

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:40.360 
people will be willing to use sheep
