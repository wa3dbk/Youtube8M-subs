and I have a good pair of cities can
have<00:02:36.780> the<00:02:36.870> pillow<00:02:37.140> sit<00:02:37.380> right<00:02:37.590> here<00:02:37.620> and<00:02:37.920> says

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
have the pillow sit right here and says

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.220 
have the pillow sit right here and says
on<00:02:38.550> with<00:02:39.000> the<00:02:39.090> yellow<00:02:39.330> and<00:02:39.810> you<00:02:39.900> can<00:02:40.020> have<00:02:40.140> the

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
on with the yellow and you can have the

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:41.870 
on with the yellow and you can have the
mutant<00:02:40.770> and<00:02:40.920> this<00:02:41.070> is<00:02:41.160> all<00:02:41.310> this<00:02:41.460> is<00:02:41.610> just

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
mutant and this is all this is just

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.360 
mutant and this is all this is just
sensing<00:02:42.210> so<00:02:42.390> hard<00:02:42.930> he<00:02:43.050> hit<00:02:43.230> it<00:02:43.380> is<00:02:43.830> a<00:02:43.890> scrape

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
sensing so hard he hit it is a scrape

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.490 
sensing so hard he hit it is a scrape
but<00:02:45.300> whatever<00:02:45.450> side<00:02:45.780> you<00:02:45.810> wants<00:02:46.200> a<00:02:46.230> lot<00:02:46.380> of

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
but whatever side you wants a lot of

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.020 
but whatever side you wants a lot of
sounds<00:02:46.680> in<00:02:46.860> here<00:02:47.100> and<00:02:47.340> there<00:02:47.490> the<00:02:47.640> sounds<00:02:47.970> you

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
sounds in here and there the sounds you

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:49.640 
sounds in here and there the sounds you
can<00:02:48.120> choose<00:02:48.360> from<00:02:48.540> and<00:02:48.930> how<00:02:49.080> to<00:02:49.200> send<00:02:49.410> them<00:02:49.530> up

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
can choose from and how to send them up

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:51.260 
can choose from and how to send them up
so<00:02:49.830> you<00:02:49.920> have<00:02:50.010> interweb<00:02:50.460> see<00:02:50.700> matt<00:02:50.880> said<00:02:51.090> right

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:51.270 
so you have interweb see matt said right

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:55.430 
so you have interweb see matt said right
there<00:02:51.860> see<00:02:52.860> the<00:02:52.920> interval<00:02:53.750> Johnson<00:02:54.750> and<00:02:55.380> I

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
there see the interval Johnson and I

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.410 
there see the interval Johnson and I
haven't<00:02:55.740> just<00:02:55.830> fitted<00:02:56.100> for<00:02:56.220> harmonic<00:02:56.790> I<00:02:56.970> can

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
haven't just fitted for harmonic I can

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.560 
haven't just fitted for harmonic I can
pick<00:02:57.600> anything<00:02:58.290> yes<00:02:58.560> I<00:02:58.680> want<00:02:58.980> in<00:02:59.190> it<00:02:59.340> I<00:02:59.570> just

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:00.570 
pick anything yes I want in it I just

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:02.030 
pick anything yes I want in it I just
have<00:03:00.720> that's<00:03:00.930> like<00:03:01.080> a<00:03:01.110> whole<00:03:01.320> way<00:03:01.500> over<00:03:01.680> with

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
have that's like a whole way over with

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.370 
have that's like a whole way over with
everyone<00:03:02.420> so<00:03:03.420> that's<00:03:03.600> how<00:03:03.750> it's<00:03:03.990> going<00:03:04.110> to<00:03:04.200> set

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380 
everyone so that's how it's going to set

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:05.990 
everyone so that's how it's going to set
up<00:03:04.500> like<00:03:04.650> them<00:03:04.860> if<00:03:05.400> you<00:03:05.550> had<00:03:05.730> a<00:03:05.760> bigger

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
up like them if you had a bigger

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.870 
up like them if you had a bigger
keyboard<00:03:06.300> so<00:03:06.750> I<00:03:06.810> have<00:03:06.990> the<00:03:07.140> 48<00:03:07.650> in<00:03:07.860> for<00:03:08.550> the<00:03:08.670> key

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
keyboard so I have the 48 in for the key

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:10.520 
keyboard so I have the 48 in for the key
so<00:03:09.090> if<00:03:09.210> you<00:03:09.330> had<00:03:09.420> you<00:03:09.690> can<00:03:09.840> have<00:03:09.930> more<00:03:10.110> set<00:03:10.440> up

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
so if you had you can have more set up

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.070 
so if you had you can have more set up
by<00:03:10.650> one<00:03:10.890> time<00:03:11.070> I<00:03:11.100> chapter<00:03:11.610> 3<00:03:11.820> set<00:03:12.030> up<00:03:12.210> which<00:03:12.960> is

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.080 
by one time I chapter 3 set up which is

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:16.460 
by one time I chapter 3 set up which is
enough<00:03:13.380> so<00:03:13.590> when<00:03:13.710> I<00:03:13.740> can<00:03:14.750> but<00:03:15.750> nothing<00:03:16.140> is<00:03:16.170> cool

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
enough so when I can but nothing is cool

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:19.130 
enough so when I can but nothing is cool
is<00:03:16.620> you<00:03:16.770> can<00:03:16.800> set<00:03:17.070> up<00:03:17.460> L<00:03:17.730> you<00:03:18.210> your<00:03:18.600> keyboard

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140 
is you can set up L you your keyboard

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:21.410 
is you can set up L you your keyboard
