00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
here that it's almost like a BIOS on an

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.080 
here that it's almost like a BIOS on an
actual<00:00:19.109> computer<00:00:19.260> it<00:00:19.949> lists<00:00:20.310> the<00:00:20.430> chipset<00:00:20.850> the

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
actual computer it lists the chipset the

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.240 
actual computer it lists the chipset the
memory<00:00:21.420> pretty<00:00:22.380> much<00:00:22.560> everything<00:00:22.949> it<00:00:23.100> looks

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
memory pretty much everything it looks

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.099 
memory pretty much everything it looks
really<00:00:23.519> cool<00:00:23.699> given<00:00:24.420> the<00:00:24.510> text<00:00:24.750> white<00:00:24.900> rami

running so if you scroll down here I

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.290 
running so if you scroll down here I
think<00:00:28.019> that's<00:00:28.199> about<00:00:28.320> it<00:00:28.619> but<00:00:28.769> yeah<00:00:29.369> you<00:00:30.119> can

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
think that's about it but yeah you can

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.880 
think that's about it but yeah you can
actually<00:00:30.449> press<00:00:30.779> some<00:00:30.990> buttons<00:00:31.019> and<00:00:31.590> it<00:00:31.769> will

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
actually press some buttons and it will

mode<00:00:34.860> and<00:00:35.340> I<00:00:35.579> think<00:00:35.760> that<00:00:35.910> it's<00:00:36.210> just<00:00:36.390> really

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
mode and I think that it's just really

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.090 
mode and I think that it's just really
awesome<00:00:36.809> and<00:00:37.230> you<00:00:37.380> can<00:00:37.530> get<00:00:37.680> different<00:00:37.920> ones

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100
