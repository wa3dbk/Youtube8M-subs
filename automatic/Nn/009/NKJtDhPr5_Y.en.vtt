00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:03.300 
something that I completely forgot to

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.470 
something that I completely forgot to
talk<00:00:03.540> about<00:00:03.689> in<00:00:04.020> my<00:00:04.200> previous<00:00:04.560> tutorials<00:00:05.480> was

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:06.480 
talk about in my previous tutorials was

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.299 
talk about in my previous tutorials was
how<00:00:06.720> to<00:00:06.750> render<00:00:07.319> your<00:00:07.649> 3d<00:00:08.040> models<00:00:08.400> and

00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:10.309 
how to render your 3d models and

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:13.339 
how to render your 3d models and
simplest<00:00:11.309> way<00:00:11.490> to<00:00:11.759> get<00:00:12.059> the<00:00:12.900> look<00:00:13.049> that<00:00:13.110> I

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
simplest way to get the look that I

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.939 
simplest way to get the look that I
usually<00:00:13.650> use<00:00:14.130> like<00:00:14.490> this<00:00:15.330> no<00:00:15.750> shadows<00:00:16.230> just

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
usually use like this no shadows just

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:22.429 
usually use like this no shadows just
pure<00:00:17.190> texture<00:00:18.710> select<00:00:19.710> your<00:00:19.800> object<00:00:21.230> go<00:00:22.230> down

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
pure texture select your object go down

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.420 
pure texture select your object go down
to<00:00:22.590> your<00:00:22.710> materials<00:00:23.310> page<00:00:23.580> here<00:00:23.880> and<00:00:25.430> over

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
to your materials page here and over

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.710 
to your materials page here and over
here<00:00:26.460> to<00:00:26.789> sit<00:00:26.970> shadeless<00:00:27.859> if<00:00:28.970> I<00:00:29.970> render<00:00:30.630> it

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
here to sit shadeless if I render it

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.729 
here to sit shadeless if I render it
here<00:00:30.960> with<00:00:31.230> the<00:00:31.619> shameless<00:00:32.130> off<00:00:33.500> well<00:00:34.500> that

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
here with the shameless off well that

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.110 
here with the shameless off well that
doesn't<00:00:35.040> look<00:00:35.190> quite<00:00:35.520> right<00:00:35.610> oh<00:00:35.940> because

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
doesn't look quite right oh because

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:45.500 
doesn't look quite right oh because
there's<00:00:36.329> no<00:00:36.450> light<00:00:36.600> source<00:00:43.850> there<00:00:44.850> we<00:00:44.940> go<00:00:45.030> that

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
there's no light source there we go that

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.930 
there's no light source there we go that
doesn't<00:00:45.809> look<00:00:45.870> quite<00:00:45.989> right<00:00:46.160> so<00:00:47.160> what<00:00:47.910> I

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
doesn't look quite right so what I

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.990 
doesn't look quite right so what I
usually<00:00:48.149> just<00:00:48.390> do<00:00:48.690> is<00:00:49.219> turn<00:00:50.219> on<00:00:50.280> shade<00:00:50.670> lists

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
usually just do is turn on shade lists

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.700 
usually just do is turn on shade lists
and<00:00:51.260> everything<00:00:52.260> works<00:00:54.500> something<00:00:55.500> else<00:00:55.649> that

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
and everything works something else that

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.709 
and everything works something else that
I<00:00:55.829> did<00:00:56.010> not<00:00:56.190> touch<00:00:56.370> on<00:00:56.640> was<00:00:56.969> camera<00:00:57.360> control

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
I did not touch on was camera control

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.189 
I did not touch on was camera control
and<00:00:58.590> normally<00:00:59.399> we're<00:00:59.579> in<00:00:59.760> front<00:01:00.449> view<00:01:00.719> or<00:01:00.930> side

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
and normally we're in front view or side

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:05.719

the camera to get into camera view hit

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.280 
the camera to get into camera view hit
the<00:01:09.659> 0<00:01:09.930> key<00:01:10.470> on<00:01:10.740> your<00:01:10.799> numpad<00:01:11.369> and<00:01:11.850> that'll<00:01:12.540> put

you into the cameras view you can hit G

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.830 
you into the cameras view you can hit G

controls are the same as they would be

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.219 
controls are the same as they would be

in a normal situation except instead of

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:26.390 
in a normal situation except instead of
moving<00:01:25.229> that<00:01:25.530> object<00:01:25.920> you're<00:01:26.040> moving<00:01:26.310> the

moving that object you're moving the

moving that object you're moving the
camera<00:01:29.060> when<00:01:30.060> you<00:01:30.150> hit<00:01:30.329> render<00:01:30.710> whatever<00:01:31.710> is

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
camera when you hit render whatever is

camera when you hit render whatever is
within<00:01:32.960> these<00:01:33.960> boxes<00:01:34.740> here<00:01:35.930> will<00:01:36.930> be<00:01:37.200> rendered

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:38.030 
within these boxes here will be rendered

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:40.370 
within these boxes here will be rendered
anything<00:01:39.030> outside<00:01:39.299> of<00:01:39.390> it<00:01:39.600> will<00:01:39.810> not<00:01:40.020> be<00:01:40.170> you

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
anything outside of it will not be you

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.969 
anything outside of it will not be you
can<00:01:40.890> change<00:01:41.159> the<00:01:41.340> sides<00:01:41.610> the<00:01:42.210> size<00:01:42.509> of<00:01:42.979> this

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
can change the sides the size of this

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.350 
can change the sides the size of this
box<00:01:44.310> by<00:01:44.939> going<00:01:45.240> into<00:01:45.450> the<00:01:45.720> render<00:01:46.590> tab<00:01:46.799> and

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:47.360 
box by going into the render tab and

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:55.520 
box by going into the render tab and
over<00:01:48.360> here<00:01:48.600> so<00:01:50.270> 800<00:01:51.270> x<00:01:52.460> 800<00:01:54.200> well<00:01:55.200> let's<00:01:55.350> do

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
over here so 800 x 800 well let's do

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.999 
over here so 800 x 800 well let's do
something<00:01:55.740> different<00:01:57.020> 400<00:01:58.020> there<00:01:58.200> we<00:01:58.770> going

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
something different 400 there we going

00:01:59.009 --> 00:01:59.929 
something different 400 there we going
you'll<00:01:59.130> notice<00:01:59.399> that<00:01:59.430> the<00:01:59.610> size<00:01:59.759> is

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
you'll notice that the size is

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:03.560 
you'll notice that the size is
completely<00:02:00.329> different<00:02:00.479> I<00:02:00.869> hit<00:02:01.020> render<00:02:02.570> it's

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
completely different I hit render it's

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.749 
completely different I hit render it's
huge

00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:07.759 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:10.070 

you<00:02:08.759> can<00:02:08.880> also<00:02:09.000> try<00:02:09.209> on<00:02:09.330> your<00:02:09.390> auntie<00:02:09.660> lysing

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
you can also try on your auntie lysing

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.370 
you can also try on your auntie lysing
but<00:02:10.709> I<00:02:10.739> don't<00:02:10.950> like<00:02:11.069> using<00:02:11.250> that<00:02:12.230> because<00:02:13.230> it

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
but I don't like using that because it

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.460 
but I don't like using that because it
makes<00:02:13.640> it<00:02:14.660> defeats<00:02:15.660> the<00:02:15.660> purpose<00:02:15.989> of<00:02:16.290> the

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
makes it defeats the purpose of the

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.400 
makes it defeats the purpose of the
whole<00:02:16.620> low-poly<00:02:17.010> look
