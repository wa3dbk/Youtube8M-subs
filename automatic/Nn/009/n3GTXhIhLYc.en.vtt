00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.740 

oh<00:03:36.549> yeah<00:03:37.549> like<00:03:37.760> now<00:03:37.939> instead<00:03:38.360> of<00:03:38.420> that<00:03:38.569> being

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:38.750 
oh yeah like now instead of that being

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:41.020 
oh yeah like now instead of that being
overhead<00:03:39.260> low<00:03:39.470> it<00:03:39.739> just<00:03:39.920> becomes<00:03:40.099> alone<00:03:40.400> for

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:41.030 
overhead low it just becomes alone for

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:42.910 
overhead low it just becomes alone for
the<00:03:41.090> X<00:03:41.360> that's<00:03:41.510> why<00:03:41.689> you<00:03:41.780> got<00:03:41.930> them<00:03:42.049> Tom's
