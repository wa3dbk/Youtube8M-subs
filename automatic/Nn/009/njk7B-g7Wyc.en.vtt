this particular process we really

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.110 
this particular process we really
recommend<00:00:34.739> that<00:00:34.800> you<00:00:34.890> use<00:00:35.100> a<00:00:35.130> silicone<00:00:35.880> mold

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
recommend that you use a silicone mold

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.209 
recommend that you use a silicone mold
as<00:00:36.390> opposed<00:00:36.809> to<00:00:36.930> a<00:00:36.989> polyurethane<00:00:37.350> mold<00:00:38.010> in

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
polyurethane you would have to use a

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.849 
polyurethane you would have to use a
silicone<00:00:59.910> release<00:01:00.329> agent<00:01:00.780> and<00:01:00.899> that<00:01:01.350> silicone

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
silicone release agent and that silicone

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.009 
silicone release agent and that silicone
release<00:01:02.070> agent<00:01:02.670> could<00:01:02.850> potentially<00:01:03.480> cause

release agent could potentially cause

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.890 
release agent could potentially cause
the<00:01:04.229> patina<00:01:04.589> not<00:01:05.010> to<00:01:05.250> react<00:01:05.610> later<00:01:05.939> on<00:01:06.180> or<00:01:06.479> any

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
the patina not to react later on or any

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.120 
the patina not to react later on or any
kind<00:01:07.170> of<00:01:07.260> finish<00:01:07.619> that<00:01:07.860> you're<00:01:07.979> going<00:01:08.100> to

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
kind of finish that you're going to

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.460 
kind of finish that you're going to
apply<00:01:08.220> later<00:01:08.760> to<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.119> finish<00:01:09.390> cast<00:01:09.689> not<00:01:10.200> to

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
apply later to the finish cast not to

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.100 
apply later to the finish cast not to
stick<00:01:10.830> so<00:01:11.610> it's<00:01:11.970> a<00:01:12.060> good<00:01:12.180> idea<00:01:12.299> to<00:01:12.930> make<00:01:13.080> sure

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
stick so it's a good idea to make sure

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.560 
stick so it's a good idea to make sure
you<00:01:13.409> use<00:01:13.530> a<00:01:13.619> clean<00:01:13.979> silicone<00:01:14.640> mold<00:01:14.909> and<00:01:15.210> no

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
you use a clean silicone mold and no

method we use a very small amount of

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.370 
method we use a very small amount of
bronze<00:01:20.850> powder<00:01:21.180> because<00:01:21.509> we're<00:01:21.689> just<00:01:21.720> dusting

bronze powder because we're just dusting
the<00:01:22.500> surface<00:01:22.950> and<00:01:23.130> then<00:01:23.580> the<00:01:23.610> excess<00:01:24.090> powder

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
the surface and then the excess powder

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.810 
the surface and then the excess powder
we<00:01:24.630> pour<00:01:24.900> back<00:01:25.200> off<00:01:25.439> into<00:01:25.680> the<00:01:25.830> container<00:01:26.189> so

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
we pour back off into the container so

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.580 
we pour back off into the container so
you<00:01:26.909> just<00:01:27.180> wind<00:01:27.390> up<00:01:27.570> with<00:01:27.720> a<00:01:27.750> very<00:01:27.840> thin<00:01:28.560> film

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.679 
bright white so we're going to offset
that<00:01:55.740> by<00:01:55.950> adding<00:01:56.310> some<00:01:56.640> black<00:01:56.759> poly<00:01:57.180> color<00:01:57.450> you

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
could also add some brown poly color or

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.590 
could also add some brown poly color or

even blue for some metallic finishes but
what<00:02:03.960> we<00:02:04.110> want<00:02:04.409> is<00:02:04.590> a<00:02:04.619> background<00:02:05.070> color<00:02:05.670> that

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149

so when this cures this is going to give

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.140 
so when this cures this is going to give
us<00:02:15.510> a<00:02:15.659> charcoal<00:02:16.319> gray<00:02:16.709> color<00:02:17.069> rather<00:02:17.909> than<00:02:18.120> a

00:02:59.089 --> 00:02:59.099 
bit on the flexible side so you want to

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:01.429 
bit on the flexible side so you want to
be<00:02:59.189> careful<00:02:59.459> to<00:03:00.329> keep<00:03:00.359> your<00:03:00.659> pieces<00:03:00.870> flat

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:45.319 
are too hot you might not get a reaction
or<00:03:43.560> too<00:03:43.979> cold<00:03:44.310> and<00:03:44.729> you<00:03:44.790> might<00:03:44.970> not<00:03:45.090> get<00:03:45.299> a

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:45.329 
or too cold and you might not get a

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:47.809 
or too cold and you might not get a
reaction<00:03:45.769> now<00:03:46.769> the<00:03:46.829> longer<00:03:47.400> we<00:03:47.519> allow<00:03:47.760> that

00:03:47.809 --> 00:03:47.819 
reaction now the longer we allow that

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:50.240 
reaction now the longer we allow that
patina<00:03:48.389> to<00:03:48.599> sit<00:03:48.840> on<00:03:48.870> the<00:03:49.139> surface<00:03:49.319> the<00:03:49.979> more

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
patina to sit on the surface the more

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:52.909 
patina to sit on the surface the more
that<00:03:50.459> oxide<00:03:51.030> will<00:03:51.269> spread<00:03:51.629> but<00:03:52.409> once<00:03:52.739> the

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:52.919 
that oxide will spread but once the

00:03:52.919 --> 00:03:54.680 
that oxide will spread but once the
piece<00:03:53.069> is<00:03:53.250> dry<00:03:53.549> to<00:03:53.609> the<00:03:53.819> touch<00:03:53.940> ready<00:03:54.510> to

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690 
piece is dry to the touch ready to

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:57.020 
piece is dry to the touch ready to
polish<00:03:55.049> it<00:03:55.229> and<00:03:55.349> this<00:03:55.949> is<00:03:56.190> a<00:03:56.220> piece<00:03:56.729> that<00:03:56.760> we

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 
polish it and this is a piece that we

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:58.849 
polish it and this is a piece that we
allowed<00:03:57.329> to<00:03:57.510> react<00:03:57.810> for<00:03:58.079> about<00:03:58.260> an<00:03:58.379> hour<00:03:58.440> and<00:03:58.829> a

00:03:58.849 --> 00:03:58.859 
allowed to react for about an hour and a

00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:01.369 
allowed to react for about an hour and a
half<00:03:59.069> so<00:03:59.609> we<00:03:59.639> could<00:03:59.909> let<00:04:00.090> that<00:04:00.120> oxide<00:04:00.840> continue

00:04:01.369 --> 00:04:01.379 
half so we could let that oxide continue

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:03.469 
half so we could let that oxide continue
to<00:04:01.590> spread<00:04:01.979> or<00:04:02.310> at<00:04:02.729> this<00:04:02.879> point<00:04:03.150> since<00:04:03.329> we're

00:04:03.469 --> 00:04:03.479 
to spread or at this point since we're

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:04.819 
to spread or at this point since we're
actually<00:04:03.599> going<00:04:03.810> to<00:04:03.900> pull<00:04:04.139> back<00:04:04.169> some<00:04:04.620> of<00:04:04.739> that

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:04.829 
actually going to pull back some of that

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:06.289 
actually going to pull back some of that
green<00:04:05.129> we're<00:04:05.639> going<00:04:05.790> to<00:04:05.849> go<00:04:05.940> ahead<00:04:06.000> and<00:04:06.150> start

00:04:06.289 --> 00:04:06.299 
green we're going to go ahead and start

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:08.689 
green we're going to go ahead and start
polishing<00:04:06.540> up<00:04:07.079> some<00:04:07.440> of<00:04:07.530> the<00:04:07.590> high<00:04:07.739> points<00:04:08.190> now

00:04:08.689 --> 00:04:08.699 
polishing up some of the high points now

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:11.809 
polishing up some of the high points now
here<00:04:08.970> we're<00:04:09.150> using<00:04:09.180> a<00:04:09.870> quadruple<00:04:10.829> lot<00:04:11.010> steel

00:04:11.809 --> 00:04:11.819 
here we're using a quadruple lot steel

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:14.659 
here we're using a quadruple lot steel
wool<00:04:12.090> the<00:04:12.299> ultrafine<00:04:12.989> steel<00:04:13.470> wool<00:04:13.709> and<00:04:13.919> the

00:04:14.659 --> 00:04:14.669 
wool the ultrafine steel wool and the

00:04:14.669 --> 00:04:16.399 
wool the ultrafine steel wool and the
idea<00:04:15.030> here<00:04:15.299> is<00:04:15.389> just<00:04:15.419> to<00:04:15.659> pull<00:04:15.959> back<00:04:16.139> that

00:04:16.399 --> 00:04:16.409 
idea here is just to pull back that

00:04:16.409 --> 00:04:19.039 
idea here is just to pull back that
oxide<00:04:17.010> on<00:04:17.340> the<00:04:17.370> high<00:04:17.639> points<00:04:17.940> and<00:04:18.299> expose<00:04:19.019> that

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:19.049 
oxide on the high points and expose that

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:21.680 
oxide on the high points and expose that

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:21.690 
polished bronze on the high points and

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:24.080 
polished bronze on the high points and
leave<00:04:21.989> that<00:04:22.289> light<00:04:22.560> green<00:04:22.830> patina<00:04:23.219> in<00:04:23.520> all<00:04:23.969> of

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:24.090 
leave that light green patina in all of

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:25.850 
leave that light green patina in all of
those<00:04:24.210> recessed<00:04:24.779> areas<00:04:25.229> that<00:04:25.409> gives<00:04:25.620> us<00:04:25.770> a

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860 
those recessed areas that gives us a

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:27.410 
those recessed areas that gives us a
nice<00:04:26.039> contrast

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:27.420 
nice contrast

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:30.320 
nice contrast
nice<00:04:27.740> classic<00:04:28.740> antique<00:04:28.950> look<00:04:29.640> to<00:04:29.820> our<00:04:29.970> final

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:30.330 
nice classic antique look to our final

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:33.260 
nice classic antique look to our final
piece<00:04:30.650> now<00:04:31.650> when<00:04:31.890> you<00:04:32.010> use<00:04:32.280> steel<00:04:32.640> wool<00:04:32.940> like

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:33.270 
piece now when you use steel wool like

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:35.600 
piece now when you use steel wool like
this<00:04:33.510> to<00:04:33.720> polish<00:04:34.170> out<00:04:34.380> a<00:04:34.410> piece<00:04:34.770> you<00:04:35.400> want<00:04:35.490> to

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:35.610 
this to polish out a piece you want to

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:37.790 
this to polish out a piece you want to
be<00:04:35.730> very<00:04:36.120> careful<00:04:36.570> about<00:04:36.660> the<00:04:37.080> steel<00:04:37.560> wool

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:37.800 
be very careful about the steel wool

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:41.000 
be very careful about the steel wool
residue<00:04:38.460> that's<00:04:38.640> left<00:04:38.790> behind<00:04:39.570> so<00:04:40.380> once<00:04:40.800> we're

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:41.010 
residue that's left behind so once we're

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:43.280 
residue that's left behind so once we're
done<00:04:41.190> with<00:04:41.400> our<00:04:41.430> polishing<00:04:42.150> step<00:04:42.450> we<00:04:42.990> want<00:04:43.200> to

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:43.290 
done with our polishing step we want to

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:45.260 
done with our polishing step we want to
take<00:04:43.440> extra<00:04:43.860> care<00:04:44.130> to<00:04:44.310> make<00:04:44.460> sure<00:04:44.490> we<00:04:44.790> remove

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:45.270 
take extra care to make sure we remove

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:48.530 
take extra care to make sure we remove
any<00:04:45.690> of<00:04:46.230> that<00:04:46.380> dust<00:04:46.950> from<00:04:47.280> the<00:04:47.820> steel<00:04:48.210> wool

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:48.540 
any of that dust from the steel wool

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:50.810 
any of that dust from the steel wool
because<00:04:48.840> any<00:04:49.380> of<00:04:49.500> that<00:04:49.680> dust<00:04:49.950> leftover<00:04:50.640> will

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:50.820 
because any of that dust leftover will

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:53.540 
because any of that dust leftover will
react<00:04:51.210> with<00:04:51.450> that<00:04:51.480> oxide<00:04:52.170> and<00:04:52.560> give<00:04:53.040> us<00:04:53.160> rust

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:53.550 
react with that oxide and give us rust

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:54.680 
react with that oxide and give us rust
which<00:04:53.910> will<00:04:54.150> make<00:04:54.390> for<00:04:54.420> a<00:04:54.630> very

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:54.690 
which will make for a very

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:57.710 
which will make for a very
strange-looking<00:04:55.760> copper<00:04:56.760> or<00:04:56.940> bronze<00:04:57.210> piece

00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:57.720 
strange-looking copper or bronze piece

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:00.200 
strange-looking copper or bronze piece
so<00:04:58.440> once<00:04:58.890> you're<00:04:59.070> done<00:04:59.100> with<00:04:59.550> the<00:04:59.700> polishing

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:00.210 
so once you're done with the polishing

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:02.330 
so once you're done with the polishing
step<00:05:00.480> what<00:05:01.110> I<00:05:01.140> recommend<00:05:01.680> is<00:05:01.800> either<00:05:01.950> an<00:05:02.130> air

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:02.340 
step what I recommend is either an air

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:05.270 
step what I recommend is either an air
hose<00:05:02.640> or<00:05:03.000> can<00:05:03.390> Apollo<00:05:03.750> purge<00:05:04.080> to<00:05:04.440> just<00:05:04.920> blow

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:05.280 
hose or can Apollo purge to just blow

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:08.000 
hose or can Apollo purge to just blow
off<00:05:05.520> any<00:05:05.910> of<00:05:06.180> that<00:05:06.390> leftover<00:05:07.230> dust<00:05:07.680> from<00:05:07.950> your

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:08.010 
off any of that leftover dust from your

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:10.970 
off any of that leftover dust from your
steel<00:05:08.400> wool<00:05:08.430> and<00:05:09.050> don't<00:05:10.050> underestimate<00:05:10.380> this

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:10.980 
steel wool and don't underestimate this

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:13.940 
steel wool and don't underestimate this
step<00:05:11.220> because<00:05:11.610> any<00:05:11.850> of<00:05:12.090> the<00:05:12.540> leftover<00:05:13.440> steel

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:13.950 
step because any of the leftover steel

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:17.030 
step because any of the leftover steel
wool<00:05:14.190> dust<00:05:14.550> will<00:05:15.210> react<00:05:15.690> with<00:05:15.960> that<00:05:16.230> green

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:17.040 
wool dust will react with that green

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:19.700 
wool dust will react with that green
patina<00:05:17.430> over<00:05:17.760> time<00:05:18.180> and<00:05:18.540> create<00:05:19.230> little

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:19.710 
patina over time and create little

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:21.620 
patina over time and create little
pockets<00:05:20.190> of<00:05:20.310> rust<00:05:20.640> that<00:05:20.820> could<00:05:21.060> ruin<00:05:21.360> the

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:21.630 
pockets of rust that could ruin the

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:24.320 
pockets of rust that could ruin the
finish<00:05:21.810> of<00:05:22.080> your<00:05:22.110> piece<00:05:22.640> now<00:05:23.640> for<00:05:23.940> the<00:05:24.060> final

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:24.330 
finish of your piece now for the final

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:26.060 
finish of your piece now for the final

going<00:05:32.190> to<00:05:32.250> apply<00:05:32.460> over<00:05:33.120> the<00:05:33.510> top<00:05:33.690> and<00:05:33.930> just

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:34.080 
going to apply over the top and just

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:36.050 
going to apply over the top and just
gives<00:05:34.290> a<00:05:34.380> little<00:05:34.410> bit<00:05:34.740> more<00:05:34.800> character<00:05:35.310> but

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:36.060 
gives a little bit more character but

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:38.660 
gives a little bit more character but
also<00:05:36.330> gives<00:05:36.810> it<00:05:36.960> a<00:05:37.050> protective<00:05:37.650> layer<00:05:37.680> so<00:05:38.520> that

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:38.670 
also gives it a protective layer so that

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:41.540 
also gives it a protective layer so that
oxide<00:05:39.240> wants<00:05:39.690> spread<00:05:40.080> since<00:05:40.830> we<00:05:41.040> want<00:05:41.220> that<00:05:41.400> to

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:41.550 
oxide wants spread since we want that to

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:44.420 
oxide wants spread since we want that to
look<00:05:41.820> like<00:05:42.600> that<00:05:42.780> nice<00:05:43.110> green<00:05:43.530> exactly<00:05:44.280> where

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:44.430 
look like that nice green exactly where

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:46.520 
look like that nice green exactly where
we<00:05:44.550> put<00:05:44.790> it<00:05:44.940> we<00:05:45.390> don't<00:05:45.570> want<00:05:45.720> that<00:05:45.810> to<00:05:45.990> shift<00:05:46.290> or

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:46.530 
we put it we don't want that to shift or

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:49.610 
we put it we don't want that to shift or
change<00:05:46.800> over<00:05:46.980> time<00:05:47.340> and<00:05:47.640> the<00:05:47.810> wax<00:05:48.810> much<00:05:49.320> like<00:05:49.590> a

change over time and the wax much like a
clear<00:05:50.130> sealer<00:05:50.700> will<00:05:51.270> give<00:05:51.660> us<00:05:51.750> that

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:51.930 
clear sealer will give us that

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:54.170 
clear sealer will give us that
protective<00:05:52.500> barrier<00:05:52.920> so<00:05:53.250> that<00:05:53.460> our<00:05:53.580> color

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:54.180
