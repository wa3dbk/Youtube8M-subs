00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
at the world anchor and the dimension

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.689 
at the world anchor and the dimension
langa<00:00:16.170> now<00:00:16.770> let's<00:00:17.010> say<00:00:17.190> you're<00:00:17.369> doing<00:00:17.400> a

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
langa now let's say you're doing a

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:19.640 
langa now let's say you're doing a
large-scale<00:00:18.270> construction<00:00:18.510> projects<00:00:19.350> you've

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
large-scale construction projects you've

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.830 
large-scale construction projects you've
got<00:00:19.770> lava<00:00:20.070> pumping<00:00:20.490> from<00:00:20.609> ok<00:00:21.029> know<00:00:21.180> many<00:00:21.449> many

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
got lava pumping from ok know many many

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.259 
got lava pumping from ok know many many
miles<00:00:22.080> away<00:00:22.350> got<00:00:23.039> quarry's<00:00:23.400> deep<00:00:23.699> underground

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
miles away got quarry's deep underground

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:25.340 
miles away got quarry's deep underground
and<00:00:24.480> basically<00:00:24.779> want<00:00:24.990> to<00:00:25.050> keep<00:00:25.170> these<00:00:25.320> things

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
and basically want to keep these things

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:26.960 
and basically want to keep these things
running<00:00:25.830> now<00:00:26.220> what<00:00:26.430> happens<00:00:26.730> when<00:00:26.880> you

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
running now what happens when you

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.759 
running now what happens when you
actually<00:00:27.090> leave<00:00:27.420> the<00:00:27.480> chunk<00:00:27.900> the<00:00:28.380> chunk<00:00:28.619> will

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
actually leave the chunk the chunk will

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.859 
actually leave the chunk the chunk will
do<00:00:28.890> load<00:00:29.130> and<00:00:29.519> your<00:00:29.910> machine<00:00:30.269> will<00:00:30.300> just<00:00:30.689> stop

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
do load and your machine will just stop

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.389 
do load and your machine will just stop
working<00:00:31.050> and<00:00:31.380> you<00:00:31.470> won't<00:00:31.619> get<00:00:31.769> anything<00:00:32.009> for

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
working and you won't get anything for

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.490 
working and you won't get anything for
it<00:00:32.460> so<00:00:33.210> how<00:00:33.360> do<00:00:33.420> we<00:00:33.540> combat<00:00:33.870> this<00:00:34.020> problem<00:00:34.140> well

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
it so how do we combat this problem well

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.200 
it so how do we combat this problem well
you've<00:00:35.070> got<00:00:35.190> the<00:00:35.280> world<00:00:35.460> on<00:00:35.550> get<00:00:35.790> and<00:00:36.000> as<00:00:36.090> I

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
you've got the world on get and as I

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.150 
you've got the world on get and as I
mention<00:00:36.540> again<00:00:36.840> first<00:00:37.559> let's<00:00:37.770> have<00:00:37.890> a<00:00:37.920> look<00:00:38.070> at

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
mention again first let's have a look at

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.040 
mention again first let's have a look at
the<00:00:38.309> wadanka<00:00:38.790> go<00:00:39.059> geo<00:00:39.210> crafting<00:00:39.540> bench<00:00:39.660> now

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
the wadanka go geo crafting bench now

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.360 
the wadanka go geo crafting bench now
for<00:00:40.290> this<00:00:40.410> recipe<00:00:40.649> you're<00:00:40.950> going<00:00:41.100> to<00:00:41.190> need

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
for this recipe you're going to need

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.459 
for this recipe you're going to need
three<00:00:41.760> blocks<00:00:42.000> for<00:00:42.239> Sid<00:00:42.360> Ian<00:00:42.510> down<00:00:43.170> the<00:00:43.320> middle

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
three blocks for Sid Ian down the middle

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.500 
three blocks for Sid Ian down the middle
like<00:00:43.559> so<00:00:43.710> and<00:00:44.219> then<00:00:44.250> you<00:00:44.460> want<00:00:44.579> to<00:00:44.730> put<00:00:44.940> a<00:00:45.210> gold

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
like so and then you want to put a gold

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.869 
like so and then you want to put a gold
ingot<00:00:45.690> in<00:00:45.960> every<00:00:46.260> single<00:00:46.500> corner<00:00:46.680> and<00:00:46.950> then<00:00:47.850> a

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
ingot in every single corner and then a

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.389 
ingot in every single corner and then a
diamond<00:00:48.420> to<00:00:48.510> either<00:00:48.660> side<00:00:49.050> and<00:00:49.410> there<00:00:50.160> we<00:00:50.250> go

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
diamond to either side and there we go

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.160 
diamond to either side and there we go
there's<00:00:50.610> your<00:00:50.700> wild<00:00:51.030> anchor<00:00:51.300> now<00:00:51.840> let's<00:00:52.020> take

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
there's your wild anchor now let's take

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.529 
there's your wild anchor now let's take
that<00:00:52.379> and<00:00:52.559> plumbing<00:00:52.770> it<00:00:52.829> down<00:00:53.010> and<00:00:53.309> that's<00:00:54.239> it

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
that and plumbing it down and that's it

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.479 
that and plumbing it down and that's it
this<00:00:55.230> will<00:00:55.410> basically<00:00:55.500> keep<00:00:55.890> a<00:00:56.039> three<00:00:56.340> by

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
this will basically keep a three by

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.160 
this will basically keep a three by
three<00:00:56.520> chunk<00:00:57.000> loaded<00:00:57.390> so<00:00:57.570> the<00:00:57.750> chunk<00:00:57.960> we're<00:00:58.109> in

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
three chunk loaded so the chunk we're in

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.889 
three chunk loaded so the chunk we're in
at<00:00:58.289> worm<00:00:58.500> that's<00:00:58.800> what<00:00:59.570> 64,000<00:01:00.570> blocks<00:01:00.780> or

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
at worm that's what 64,000 blocks or

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.049 
at worm that's what 64,000 blocks or
something<00:01:00.989> of<00:01:01.199> that<00:01:01.230> it<00:01:01.920> will<00:01:02.039> also<00:01:02.219> keep<00:01:02.640> the

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
something of that it will also keep the

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.649 
something of that it will also keep the
adjacent<00:01:04.010> chunks<00:01:05.010> either<00:01:05.549> side<00:01:05.880> of<00:01:06.240> the

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
adjacent chunks either side of the

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.070 
adjacent chunks either side of the
chunky<00:01:07.110> rendered<00:01:07.350> month<00:01:07.530> Carly<00:01:08.070> loaded

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:09.080 
chunky rendered month Carly loaded

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:11.660 
chunky rendered month Carly loaded
basically<00:01:10.080> it's<00:01:11.010> like<00:01:11.130> having<00:01:11.640> another

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
basically it's like having another

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.789 
basically it's like having another
person<00:01:12.330> online<00:01:12.630> and<00:01:13.200> this<00:01:13.320> will<00:01:13.470> keep<00:01:13.590> all

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
person online and this will keep all

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.399 
person online and this will keep all
your<00:01:13.830> machinery<00:01:14.310> running<00:01:14.610> at<00:01:15.119> all<00:01:15.330> times<00:01:15.409> as

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
your machinery running at all times as

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.219 
your machinery running at all times as
long<00:01:16.619> as<00:01:16.799> someone<00:01:17.070> is<00:01:17.280> actually<00:01:17.460> in<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:17.820> game

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:18.229 
long as someone is actually in the game

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:20.510 
long as someone is actually in the game
it's<00:01:19.229> obviously<00:01:19.530> quite<00:01:19.590> expensive<00:01:20.040> to<00:01:20.220> make

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
it's obviously quite expensive to make

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.370 
it's obviously quite expensive to make
so<00:01:21.090> let's<00:01:21.450> go<00:01:21.630> back<00:01:21.780> to<00:01:21.810> the<00:01:21.960> crafting<00:01:22.229> bench

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
so let's go back to the crafting bench

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.770 
so let's go back to the crafting bench
and<00:01:22.619> have<00:01:22.770> a<00:01:22.799> look<00:01:22.950> at<00:01:23.009> the<00:01:23.070> dimension<00:01:23.580> of<00:01:24.479> this

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
and have a look at the dimension of this

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.030 
and have a look at the dimension of this
you're<00:01:25.020> going<00:01:25.140> to<00:01:25.229> need<00:01:25.350> one<00:01:25.380> block<00:01:25.740> of<00:01:25.890> iron

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
you're going to need one block of iron

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.770 
you're going to need one block of iron
which<00:01:26.400> you<00:01:26.549> put<00:01:26.700> in<00:01:26.820> the<00:01:26.880> middle<00:01:27.119> and<00:01:27.299> then<00:01:27.509> on

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
which you put in the middle and then on

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.190 
which you put in the middle and then on
either<00:01:28.049> side<00:01:28.409> you<00:01:29.130> put<00:01:29.460> gold<00:01:30.180> ingots<00:01:30.509> now<00:01:30.750> take

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
either side you put gold ingots now take

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.380 
either side you put gold ingots now take
a<00:01:31.229> dimensional<00:01:31.740> anchor<00:01:31.979> like<00:01:32.130> so<00:01:32.340> plump<00:01:33.240> that

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
a dimensional anchor like so plump that

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.420 
a dimensional anchor like so plump that
down<00:01:33.570> now<00:01:33.780> right<00:01:34.229> click<00:01:34.409> on<00:01:34.560> it<00:01:34.619> and<00:01:34.740> it<00:01:35.220> brings

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
down now right click on it and it brings

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.490 
down now right click on it and it brings
up<00:01:35.460> this<00:01:35.880> little<00:01:36.060> box<00:01:36.299> here<00:01:36.450> now<00:01:37.079> basically<00:01:37.320> at

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
up this little box here now basically at

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.200 
up this little box here now basically at
the<00:01:37.590> moment<00:01:37.860> the<00:01:38.100> dimension<00:01:38.520> Lanka<00:01:38.850> is<00:01:38.909> only

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
the moment the dimension Lanka is only

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.780 
the moment the dimension Lanka is only
keeping<00:01:39.720> a<00:01:39.840> one<00:01:40.020> by<00:01:40.229> one<00:01:40.470> chunk<00:01:40.860> loaded<00:01:41.400> so<00:01:41.610> the

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
keeping a one by one chunk loaded so the

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.179 
keeping a one by one chunk loaded so the
chunk<00:01:42.030> are<00:01:42.150> in<00:01:42.240> that<00:01:42.810> stays<00:01:43.049> loaded<00:01:43.470> now<00:01:44.040> with

this<00:01:44.310> one<00:01:44.490> you<00:01:44.520> can<00:01:44.610> actually<00:01:44.909> set<00:01:45.390> it<00:01:45.570> so<00:01:45.810> you

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
this one you can actually set it so you

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.710 
this one you can actually set it so you
can<00:01:46.020> have<00:01:46.200> three<00:01:46.770> x<00:01:46.950> 35.5<00:01:47.579> seven<00:01:48.450> point<00:01:48.600> seven

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
can have three x 35.5 seven point seven

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.929 
can have three x 35.5 seven point seven
or<00:01:49.110> nine<00:01:49.170> by<00:01:49.619> nine<00:01:49.860> so<00:01:50.579> you<00:01:50.640> can<00:01:50.790> actually

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
or nine by nine so you can actually

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.999 
or nine by nine so you can actually
choose<00:01:51.540> the<00:01:52.259> amount<00:01:52.320> of<00:01:52.530> chunks<00:01:52.799> you<00:01:52.860> want

have a powerful computer try and keep it

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.870 
have a powerful computer try and keep it
