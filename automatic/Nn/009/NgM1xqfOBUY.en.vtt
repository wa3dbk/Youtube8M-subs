00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
we have to also find the sum of the

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.810 
we have to also find the sum of the
first<00:00:29.070> 15<00:00:29.699> terms<00:00:29.939> in<00:00:30.210> each<00:00:30.420> case<00:00:30.689> right<00:00:31.170> so<00:00:32.130> in

first 15 terms in each case right so in
this<00:00:33.000> problem<00:00:33.270> first<00:00:33.630> we<00:00:33.719> have<00:00:33.870> to<00:00:33.960> show<00:00:34.110> an

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
this problem first we have to show an

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.110 
this problem first we have to show an
AEP<00:00:34.559> after<00:00:35.370> showing<00:00:35.610> the<00:00:35.730> art<00:00:35.969> medical

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
AEP after showing the art medical

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.119 
AEP after showing the art medical
mission<00:00:36.630> we<00:00:36.840> have<00:00:37.020> to<00:00:37.140> find<00:00:37.380> the<00:00:37.500> sum<00:00:37.829> of<00:00:37.860> the

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
mission we have to find the sum of the

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.200 
mission we have to find the sum of the
first<00:00:38.370> 15<00:00:39.030> terms<00:00:39.329> right<00:00:39.719> so<00:00:40.820> let<00:00:41.820> me<00:00:41.940> write<00:00:42.059> the

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
first 15 terms right so let me write the

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.279 
first 15 terms right so let me write the
first<00:00:42.469> first<00:00:43.469> case<00:00:43.710> that<00:00:43.980> is<00:00:44.370> e<00:00:44.579> and<00:00:45.030> is<00:00:45.690> equals

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
first first case that is e and is equals

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.160 
first first case that is e and is equals
to<00:00:46.379> 3<00:00:47.340> plus<00:00:47.930> Florian

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
to 3 plus Florian

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.790 
to 3 plus Florian
so<00:00:50.030> when<00:00:51.030> N<00:00:51.360> equals<00:00:51.390> to<00:00:51.840> 1<00:00:52.050> we'll<00:00:52.410> get<00:00:52.590> the

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
so when N equals to 1 we'll get the

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.680 
so when N equals to 1 we'll get the
frustum<00:00:53.280> a<00:00:53.460> 1<00:00:53.730> equals<00:00:54.030> to<00:00:54.260> 3<00:00:55.260> plus<00:00:55.770> 4<00:00:56.370> times<00:00:57.360> 1

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
frustum a 1 equals to 3 plus 4 times 1

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.180 
frustum a 1 equals to 3 plus 4 times 1
that<00:00:57.989> is<00:00:58.170> 3<00:00:58.379> plus<00:00:59.280> 4<00:00:59.789> equals<00:01:00.239> to<00:01:00.420> 7<00:01:01.289> and<00:01:01.620> again

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
that is 3 plus 4 equals to 7 and again

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.030 
that is 3 plus 4 equals to 7 and again
when<00:01:02.430> N<00:01:02.609> equals<00:01:02.640> to<00:01:03.120> 2<00:01:03.170> will<00:01:04.170> get<00:01:04.439> the<00:01:04.650> second

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
when N equals to 2 will get the second

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.500 
when N equals to 2 will get the second
term<00:01:05.100> that<00:01:05.549> is<00:01:06.119> 3<00:01:06.540> plus<00:01:07.080> 4<00:01:07.560> times<00:01:08.070> 2<00:01:08.400> that<00:01:09.270> is<00:01:09.479> 3

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
term that is 3 plus 4 times 2 that is 3

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.760 
term that is 3 plus 4 times 2 that is 3
plus<00:01:10.500> 4<00:01:11.310> times<00:01:11.520> 2<00:01:11.729> that<00:01:11.850> is<00:01:12.000> 8<00:01:12.299> 8<00:01:13.260> plus<00:01:13.560> 3<00:01:13.680> that

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
plus 4 times 2 that is 8 8 plus 3 that

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:20.570 
plus 4 times 2 that is 8 8 plus 3 that
is<00:01:14.119> 11<00:01:15.740> again<00:01:16.740> when<00:01:17.009> N<00:01:17.250> equals<00:01:17.280> to<00:01:17.670> 3<00:01:18.140> 8<00:01:19.140> 3<00:01:19.580> will

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
is 11 again when N equals to 3 8 3 will

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.039 
is 11 again when N equals to 3 8 3 will
be<00:01:20.729> equals<00:01:21.060> to<00:01:21.119> 3<00:01:21.570> plus<00:01:22.080> 4<00:01:22.619> times<00:01:23.130> 3<00:01:23.810> that<00:01:24.810> is<00:01:25.020> 3

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.520 
me find the common difference here
between<00:02:11.280> this<00:02:11.700> and<00:02:11.940> this<00:02:12.120> 11<00:02:12.569> and<00:02:12.690> 7

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
between this and this 11 and 7

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:20.180 
between this and this 11 and 7
so<00:02:13.770> 11<00:02:14.400> minus<00:02:14.690> 7<00:02:15.690> equals<00:02:16.290> 2<00:02:17.150> now<00:02:18.150> 7<00:02:18.930> 5<00:02:19.260> right<00:02:19.530> and

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
so 11 minus 7 equals 2 now 7 5 right and

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:24.140 
so 11 minus 7 equals 2 now 7 5 right and
not<00:02:20.370> exactly<00:02:20.760> 4<00:02:21.770> 4<00:02:22.770> so<00:02:23.040> in<00:02:23.160> Evin<00:02:23.340> -7<00:02:23.790> equals<00:02:23.850> to

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
not exactly 4 4 so in Evin -7 equals to

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.410 
not exactly 4 4 so in Evin -7 equals to
4<00:02:24.360> and<00:02:24.569> if<00:02:25.200> I<00:02:25.350> will<00:02:25.470> subtract<00:02:25.860> 19-15<00:02:26.790> then

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
4 and if I will subtract 19-15 then

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.660 
4 and if I will subtract 19-15 then
again<00:02:27.660> it<00:02:27.780> will<00:02:27.900> be<00:02:28.080> 4<00:02:28.350> right<00:02:28.740> and<00:02:28.980> if<00:02:29.400> I<00:02:29.550> will

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
again it will be 4 right and if I will

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.790 
again it will be 4 right and if I will
subtract<00:02:30.030> 11<00:02:30.150> from<00:02:30.420> the<00:02:30.630> 15<00:02:31.080> then<00:02:31.290> also<00:02:31.440> I<00:02:31.590> will

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
subtract 11 from the 15 then also I will

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.220 
subtract 11 from the 15 then also I will
get<00:02:31.920> 4<00:02:32.190> so<00:02:32.700> everywhere<00:02:33.239> the<00:02:33.390> difference<00:02:34.080> is

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
get 4 so everywhere the difference is

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:35.540 
get 4 so everywhere the difference is
forced<00:02:34.590> so<00:02:34.709> since<00:02:35.010> the<00:02:35.130> difference<00:02:35.430> is

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
forced so since the difference is

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:37.670 
forced so since the difference is
constant<00:02:36.060> I<00:02:36.150> can<00:02:36.180> say<00:02:36.510> this<00:02:36.959> is<00:02:37.140> an<00:02:37.260> automatic

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
constant I can say this is an automatic

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.240 
constant I can say this is an automatic
progression<00:02:38.160> right<00:02:38.670> so<00:02:39.470> now<00:02:40.470> I<00:02:40.530> have<00:02:40.920> to<00:02:41.040> find

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
progression right so now I have to find

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.970 
progression right so now I have to find
the<00:02:41.400> sum<00:02:41.700> of<00:02:41.730> the<00:02:42.030> anthems<00:02:42.420> of<00:02:42.540> the<00:02:42.690> 15th<00:02:43.260> Tom's

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
the sum of the anthems of the 15th Tom's

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.360 
the sum of the anthems of the 15th Tom's
right<00:02:44.250> the<00:02:44.640> first<00:02:44.910> 15<00:02:45.330> so<00:02:45.989> it<00:02:46.200> means<00:02:46.410> first<00:02:46.830> 15

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
right the first 15 so it means first 15

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.259 
right the first 15 so it means first 15
right<00:02:47.730> and<00:02:47.940> he's<00:02:48.480> here<00:02:48.920> 9:15<00:02:49.920> and<00:02:50.120> frustum<00:02:51.120> is

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:51.269 
right and he's here 9:15 and frustum is

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:54.470 
right and he's here 9:15 and frustum is
here<00:02:51.510> 7<00:02:52.410> as<00:02:52.560> we<00:02:52.920> have<00:02:53.070> got<00:02:53.280> this<00:02:53.459> now<00:02:53.940> I<00:02:53.970> have<00:02:54.360> to

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
here 7 as we have got this now I have to

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.930 
here 7 as we have got this now I have to
find<00:02:54.660> the<00:02:54.810> sum<00:02:55.080> of<00:02:55.110> the<00:02:55.440> 15<00:02:55.830> long<00:02:56.280> right<00:02:56.730> and

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
find the sum of the 15 long right and

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.750 
find the sum of the 15 long right and
some<00:02:57.480> of<00:02:57.660> the<00:02:57.780> 15<00:02:58.140> thumb<00:02:58.380> for<00:02:59.310> this<00:02:59.459> formula

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
some of the 15 thumb for this formula

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.210 
some of the 15 thumb for this formula
the<00:02:59.940> sum<00:03:00.180> of<00:03:00.209> anthems<00:03:00.690> is<00:03:00.870> an<00:03:00.989> upon<00:03:01.230> to<00:03:01.470> write

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
the sum of anthems is an upon to write

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:07.490 
the sum of anthems is an upon to write
to<00:03:02.850> a<00:03:02.880> plus<00:03:03.450> and<00:03:04.250> minus<00:03:05.250> 1<00:03:05.750> times<00:03:06.750> the<00:03:07.050> common

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
to a plus and minus 1 times the common

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.550 
to a plus and minus 1 times the common
difference<00:03:07.739> right<00:03:08.370> so<00:03:09.269> as<00:03:09.510> 15<00:03:09.989> is<00:03:10.140> equals<00:03:10.500> to

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
difference right so as 15 is equals to

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:16.610 
difference right so as 15 is equals to
now<00:03:11.090> 15<00:03:12.090> up<00:03:12.360> and<00:03:12.840> 2<00:03:13.230> times<00:03:14.100> 2<00:03:14.430> times<00:03:15.390> e<00:03:15.900> is<00:03:16.260> the

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
now 15 up and 2 times 2 times e is the

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:20.270 
now 15 up and 2 times 2 times e is the
first<00:03:16.860> term<00:03:17.010> that<00:03:17.040> is<00:03:17.190> 7<00:03:17.640> here<00:03:18.410> again<00:03:19.410> n<00:03:19.620> plus<00:03:19.950> n

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
first term that is 7 here again n plus n

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:24.490 
first term that is 7 here again n plus n
minus<00:03:20.340> 1<00:03:20.700> and<00:03:21.060> is<00:03:21.299> here<00:03:21.510> total<00:03:21.870> 15<00:03:22.850> minus<00:03:23.850> 1

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:24.500 
minus 1 and is here total 15 minus 1

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.870 
minus 1 and is here total 15 minus 1
times<00:03:25.500> the<00:03:25.650> common<00:03:25.920> difference<00:03:26.130> common

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
times the common difference common

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:33.380 
times the common difference common
difference<00:03:27.180> here<00:03:27.329> is<00:03:27.480> 4<00:03:27.750> right<00:03:29.360> again<00:03:32.030> 15<00:03:33.030> up

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:33.390 
difference here is 4 right again 15 up

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:38.870 
difference here is 4 right again 15 up
on<00:03:33.660> to<00:03:34.549> two<00:03:35.549> sevens<00:03:36.000> of<00:03:36.180> 14<00:03:36.799> right<00:03:37.799> 15<00:03:38.549> minus<00:03:38.820> 1

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:38.880 
on to two sevens of 14 right 15 minus 1

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:42.580 
on to two sevens of 14 right 15 minus 1
again<00:03:39.239> 14<00:03:39.870> times<00:03:40.500> the<00:03:41.310> 4<00:03:41.610> right

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:42.590 
again 14 times the 4 right

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:48.430 
again 14 times the 4 right
so<00:03:43.590> again<00:03:44.420> 15<00:03:45.420> divided<00:03:45.660> by<00:03:45.690> 2<00:03:46.019> it<00:03:46.920> will<00:03:47.130> be<00:03:47.190> and

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:48.440 
so again 15 divided by 2 it will be and

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:52.789 
so again 15 divided by 2 it will be and
see<00:03:49.440> ya<00:03:49.590> in<00:03:49.799> both<00:03:50.310> cases<00:03:50.609> here<00:03:51.540> is<00:03:51.660> 14<00:03:52.290> and<00:03:52.440> 14

00:03:52.789 --> 00:03:52.799 
see ya in both cases here is 14 and 14

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:55.819 
see ya in both cases here is 14 and 14
so<00:03:53.370> 14<00:03:53.400> comes<00:03:54.090> outside<00:03:54.600> so<00:03:55.049> one<00:03:55.260> remains<00:03:55.620> here

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:55.829 
so 14 comes outside so one remains here

00:03:55.829 --> 00:03:59.900 
so 14 comes outside so one remains here
and<00:03:56.040> this<00:03:56.540> 4<00:03:57.540> will<00:03:57.660> be<00:03:57.870> here<00:03:58.079> so<00:03:58.680> two<00:03:58.910> sevens

00:03:59.900 --> 00:03:59.910 
and this 4 will be here so two sevens

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:04.180 
and this 4 will be here so two sevens
are<00:04:00.090> right<00:04:00.450> so<00:04:01.200> now<00:04:01.410> it<00:04:01.590> is<00:04:01.620> 15<00:04:02.459> times<00:04:02.880> 7<00:04:03.510> times

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:04.190 
are right so now it is 15 times 7 times

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:11.770 
are right so now it is 15 times 7 times
5<00:04:05.190> right<00:04:05.570> so<00:04:06.570> again<00:04:07.190> 5<00:04:08.190> 15<00:04:09.019> 15<00:04:10.019> 15<00:04:10.380> 5<00:04:10.829> just<00:04:11.070> 75

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:11.780 
5 right so again 5 15 15 15 5 just 75

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:14.060 
5 right so again 5 15 15 15 5 just 75
times<00:04:12.780> 7<00:04:13.530> right

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:14.070 
times 7 right

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:18.080 
times 7 right
so<00:04:14.370> 75<00:04:14.700> 7.75<00:04:15.630> da<00:04:16.140> 35<00:04:17.100> carry<00:04:17.340> over<00:04:17.519> three<00:04:17.729> seven

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
so 75 7.75 da 35 carry over three seven

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:22.310 
so 75 7.75 da 35 carry over three seven
sevens<00:04:18.390> of<00:04:18.539> 49<00:04:18.930> 49<00:04:19.260> plus<00:04:19.590> 352<00:04:20.539> right<00:04:21.539> so<00:04:22.049> five

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:22.320 
sevens of 49 49 plus 352 right so five

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:24.740 
sevens of 49 49 plus 352 right so five
two<00:04:22.590> five<00:04:22.800> so<00:04:23.220> we<00:04:23.370> got<00:04:23.610> the<00:04:23.789> first<00:04:24.000> sum<00:04:24.479> of<00:04:24.630> the

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:24.750 
two five so we got the first sum of the

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:27.439 
two five so we got the first sum of the
first<00:04:24.990> 15<00:04:25.560> terms<00:04:25.830> as<00:04:26.039> a

00:04:27.439 --> 00:04:27.449 
first 15 terms as a

00:04:27.449 --> 00:04:31.980 
first 15 terms as a
525<00:04:28.620> for<00:04:29.620> the<00:04:29.740> first<00:04:30.069> case<00:04:30.310> right<00:04:30.699> now<00:04:30.990> in

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:31.990 
525 for the first case right now in

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:34.439 
525 for the first case right now in
second<00:04:32.439> case<00:04:32.590> also<00:04:32.830> exactly<00:04:33.669> we<00:04:33.849> have<00:04:33.879> to<00:04:34.090> do

00:04:34.439 --> 00:04:34.449 
second case also exactly we have to do

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:36.689 
second case also exactly we have to do
the<00:04:34.599> same<00:04:34.900> thing<00:04:35.439> as<00:04:35.650> we<00:04:35.919> have<00:04:36.069> done<00:04:36.280> over<00:04:36.400> here

00:04:36.689 --> 00:04:36.699 
the same thing as we have done over here

00:04:36.699 --> 00:04:38.399 
the same thing as we have done over here
right<00:04:36.879> and<00:04:37.060> I<00:04:37.419> hope<00:04:37.599> you'll<00:04:37.900> be<00:04:37.960> doing<00:04:38.259> this

00:04:38.399 --> 00:04:38.409 
right and I hope you'll be doing this

00:04:38.409 --> 00:04:40.649 
right and I hope you'll be doing this
and<00:04:38.650> trying<00:04:39.550> to<00:04:39.729> solve<00:04:39.939> this<00:04:40.090> problem<00:04:40.150> write

00:04:40.649 --> 00:04:40.659 
and trying to solve this problem write

00:04:40.659 --> 00:04:42.570 
and trying to solve this problem write
it<00:04:40.840> exactly<00:04:41.110> the<00:04:41.500> same<00:04:41.530> as<00:04:41.919> I<00:04:41.949> have<00:04:42.189> proceeded

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:42.580 
it exactly the same as I have proceeded

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:45.209 
it exactly the same as I have proceeded
right<00:04:42.909> so<00:04:43.330> do<00:04:43.509> follow<00:04:43.960> these<00:04:44.199> steps<00:04:44.680> as<00:04:44.949> I<00:04:44.979> have

00:04:45.209 --> 00:04:45.219 
right so do follow these steps as I have

00:04:45.219 --> 00:04:48.360 
right so do follow these steps as I have
done<00:04:45.400> and<00:04:45.580> you'll<00:04:45.969> be<00:04:46.150> getting<00:04:46.389> the<00:04:47.370> solution

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:48.370 
done and you'll be getting the solution

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:51.300 
done and you'll be getting the solution
of<00:04:48.729> this<00:04:48.849> of<00:04:49.689> this<00:04:49.990> part<00:04:50.409> right<00:04:50.590> so<00:04:51.099> this<00:04:51.250> is

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:51.310 
of this of this part right so this is

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:54.089 
of this of this part right so this is
let<00:04:52.120> me<00:04:52.150> read<00:04:52.750> once<00:04:52.990> again<00:04:53.229> this<00:04:53.500> is<00:04:53.650> a<00:04:53.800> n

00:04:54.089 --> 00:04:54.099 
let me read once again this is a n

00:04:54.099 --> 00:04:56.309 
let me read once again this is a n
equals<00:04:54.460> to<00:04:54.580> n<00:04:54.729> minus<00:04:55.120> phibn<00:04:55.360> right<00:04:55.689> put<00:04:56.169> the

00:04:56.309 --> 00:04:56.319 
equals to n minus phibn right put the

00:04:56.319 --> 00:04:58.230 
equals to n minus phibn right put the
velov<00:04:56.620> and<00:04:56.860> one<00:04:57.189> two<00:04:57.430> three<00:04:57.460> four<00:04:57.879> five<00:04:58.090> six
