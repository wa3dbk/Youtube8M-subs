00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:07.650
 but let's try 

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:11.370
 open a bottle without 

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:15.030
 that is, a car without removing corks 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:18.590
 a house and we do not have samples of 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.590
 instrument the implements are 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:23.440
 a screw 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:26.520
 you have to wash it because it may come 

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:26.520
 to be in contact with the 

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:33.100
 pointed the way 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:35.489
 and apart from that you also need a 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.489
 hammer 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.180
 but he did not detect if in life 

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:49.300
 the nicked pastor 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.300
 or screwdriver us 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:57.290
 and up to where 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:00.650
 not to screws 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:02.900
 in this case how far does the cute 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:05.570
 of the xi so that it holds all the 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:07.010
 short because we just did it and do not know 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:09.340
 did with all the thread and cracked the 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:09.340
 cork 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:20.570
 and how many centimeters of screw that 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:23.630
 be the length of the short and if you have yes 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:25.969
 has this space without great thread 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:29.680
 if I do it does not matter having screws what 

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:29.680
 do before you drop to take off 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:33.549
 ah 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:45.200
 because we lack the typical walk 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.200
 situation in which we 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.840
 and there is everything inside 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.310
 again for here 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:02:03.320
 since we are in full show 9 lights 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.320
 we have realized that we see each other 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.610
 do not 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:16.400
 [Music] 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:18.909
 fantastic very well and well but because 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.909
 ifai
