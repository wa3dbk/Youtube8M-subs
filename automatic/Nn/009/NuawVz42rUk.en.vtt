what the spiral steel boning looks like

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.260 
what the spiral steel boning looks like
it's<00:00:37.710> flexible<00:00:38.309> it<00:00:38.430> bends<00:00:38.640> this<00:00:38.879> way<00:00:38.940> it<00:00:39.239> also

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
it's flexible it bends this way it also

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
boning and putting it on to over this

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.240 
boning and putting it on to over this
channel<00:01:05.030> it's<00:01:06.030> gonna<00:01:06.119> start<00:01:06.510> an<00:01:06.750> inch<00:01:07.650> in<00:01:07.950> so<00:01:08.220> I

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
channel it's gonna start an inch in so I

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.440 
channel it's gonna start an inch in so I
have<00:01:08.400> it<00:01:08.490> marked<00:01:08.610> in<00:01:08.790> pencil<00:01:09.119> I<00:01:09.210> don't<00:01:09.330> know<00:01:09.390> if
