and the pop you get out of those things

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.290 
and the pop you get out of those things
it's<00:01:01.770> pretty<00:01:01.890> unmatched<00:01:02.340> with<00:01:02.699> just<00:01:03.180> that

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950

benefits<00:01:08.159> of<00:01:09.060> a<00:01:09.210> cambered<00:01:09.510> board<00:01:09.540> but<00:01:09.960> make<00:01:10.080> a

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
benefits of a cambered board but make a

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.350 
benefits of a cambered board but make a
little<00:01:10.260> bit<00:01:10.409> a<00:01:10.670> little<00:01:11.670> bit<00:01:11.760> easier<00:01:12.000> to<00:01:12.090> ride

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
little bit a little bit easier to ride

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.210 
little bit a little bit easier to ride
so<00:01:12.780> that's<00:01:13.350> why<00:01:13.439> that<00:01:13.500> camber<00:01:13.890> is<00:01:13.979> pretty

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
so that's why that camber is pretty

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.980 
so that's why that camber is pretty
mellow<00:01:14.460> it's<00:01:14.760> not<00:01:14.939> a<00:01:14.970> not<00:01:15.570> a<00:01:15.600> whole<00:01:15.810> lot<00:01:15.960> of

mellow it's not a not a whole lot of

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
rise and also um the contact points here

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.230 
rise and also um the contact points here
just<00:01:19.140> have<00:01:19.290> a<00:01:19.320> little<00:01:19.530> bit<00:01:19.740> of<00:01:20.040> rocker<00:01:20.820> with<00:01:21.180> a

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
just have a little bit of rocker with a

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.240 
just have a little bit of rocker with a
flat<00:01:21.509> kind<00:01:21.720> of<00:01:21.869> section<00:01:22.170> so<00:01:22.380> what<00:01:22.979> that<00:01:23.100> does

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
flat kind of section so what that does

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.320 
flat kind of section so what that does
is<00:01:23.430> that<00:01:23.460> this<00:01:23.610> kind<00:01:23.790> of<00:01:23.820> takes<00:01:24.030> some<00:01:24.119> of<00:01:24.240> the

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
is that this kind of takes some of the

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.060 
is that this kind of takes some of the
pressure<00:01:24.360> off<00:01:24.689> the<00:01:24.869> tips<00:01:25.110> you<00:01:25.320> know<00:01:25.470> just<00:01:25.920> kind

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
pressure off the tips you know just kind

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.920 
pressure off the tips you know just kind

a lot of pressure on your contact points
here<00:01:29.850> which<00:01:30.270> can<00:01:30.390> be<00:01:30.509> a<00:01:30.540> little<00:01:30.630> squirrely

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
here which can be a little squirrely

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.690 
here which can be a little squirrely
sometimes<00:01:31.380> it's<00:01:31.560> a<00:01:31.829> little<00:01:31.950> off<00:01:32.220> you<00:01:32.430> know<00:01:32.549> and

sometimes it's a little off you know and

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.609 
sometimes it's a little off you know and
catch<00:01:33.000> your<00:01:33.150> edge<00:01:33.270> and<00:01:33.329> slam<00:01:33.659> but<00:01:34.259> this<00:01:34.439> thing

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.359 
is pretty sweet those tips really do
kind<00:01:37.409> of<00:01:37.439> that<00:01:37.560> blend<00:01:37.799> zone<00:01:38.009> and<00:01:38.100> the<00:01:38.159> tips

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
kind of that blend zone and the tips

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.219 
kind of that blend zone and the tips
really<00:01:38.579> helps<00:01:38.939> loosen<00:01:39.450> up<00:01:39.659> the<00:01:39.750> ride<00:01:39.930> just<00:01:40.140> a

really helps loosen up the ride just a
little<00:01:40.409> bit<00:01:40.530> but<00:01:40.829> it<00:01:41.189> doesn't<00:01:41.579> um<00:01:41.700> you<00:01:42.360> know

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479

about the core profile this board is
really<00:01:48.390> consistent<00:01:48.750> you<00:01:49.560> don't<00:01:49.710> have<00:01:49.799> a<00:01:49.829> lot

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
really consistent you don't have a lot

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.590 
really consistent you don't have a lot
of<00:01:50.009> corn<00:01:50.220> milling<00:01:50.520> going<00:01:50.729> on<00:01:50.880> it's<00:01:51.360> just<00:01:51.479> a

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
of corn milling going on it's just a

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.389 
of corn milling going on it's just a
consistent<00:01:52.200> taper<00:01:52.439> you<00:01:53.009> know<00:01:53.130> from<00:01:53.310> the

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
consistent taper you know from the

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.429 
consistent taper you know from the
center<00:01:53.670> out<00:01:53.939> and<00:01:54.210> that<00:01:54.840> gives<00:01:55.110> you<00:01:55.200> a<00:01:55.259> really

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
center out and that gives you a really

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.880 
solid feel really consistent feel
throughout<00:01:57.869> the<00:01:58.020> board<00:01:58.229> it's<00:01:58.439> really<00:01:58.740> really

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
throughout the board it's really really

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.440 
throughout the board it's really really
stiff<00:01:59.189> between<00:01:59.729> the<00:01:59.820> feet<00:02:00.000> that's<00:02:00.240> something

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
stiff between the feet that's something

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:01.880 
stiff between the feet that's something
I<00:02:00.479> noticed<00:02:00.630> when<00:02:00.810> I<00:02:00.899> wrote<00:02:01.110> it<00:02:01.140> I'm<00:02:01.530> part<00:02:01.860> of

that stiffness comes from the carbon
fiber<00:02:03.630> in<00:02:03.930> this<00:02:04.530> board<00:02:04.799> so<00:02:05.310> it<00:02:05.399> has<00:02:05.520> carbon

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.260 
fiber in this board so it has carbon
fiber<00:02:06.030> just<00:02:06.869> kind<00:02:07.110> of<00:02:07.170> stringers<00:02:07.560> that<00:02:07.799> go<00:02:08.580> tip

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
fiber just kind of stringers that go tip

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:10.999 
fiber just kind of stringers that go tip
to<00:02:09.390> tail<00:02:09.539> about<00:02:09.929> here<00:02:10.170> to<00:02:10.289> here<00:02:10.319> on<00:02:10.619> each<00:02:10.739> side

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
to tail about here to here on each side

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.250 
to tail about here to here on each side
and<00:02:11.610> what<00:02:11.730> that<00:02:11.879> does<00:02:12.030> is<00:02:12.270> um<00:02:12.450> really<00:02:12.720> helps

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
and what that does is um really helps

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.820 
and what that does is um really helps
you

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
you

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.160 
you
with<00:02:14.280> some<00:02:14.460> pop<00:02:14.690> helps<00:02:15.690> you<00:02:15.780> kind<00:02:15.840> of<00:02:15.930> put<00:02:16.080> down

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
with some pop helps you kind of put down

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:17.420 
with some pop helps you kind of put down
some<00:02:16.320> landings<00:02:16.620> this<00:02:16.770> has<00:02:16.890> a<00:02:16.920> really<00:02:17.100> stiff

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
some landings this has a really stiff

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.060 
some landings this has a really stiff
you<00:02:17.850> know<00:02:17.910> area<00:02:18.300> to<00:02:18.570> set<00:02:19.290> things<00:02:19.440> down<00:02:19.680> or<00:02:19.710> to

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.070 
you know area to set things down or to

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:22.550 
you know area to set things down or to
load<00:02:20.220> things<00:02:20.490> up<00:02:20.760> it<00:02:21.450> also<00:02:21.600> really<00:02:21.900> helps<00:02:21.960> hold

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
load things up it also really helps hold

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.530 
load things up it also really helps hold
to<00:02:22.680> that<00:02:22.860> that<00:02:23.340> edge<00:02:23.520> hold<00:02:23.790> but<00:02:24.000> it's<00:02:24.390> not

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
to that that edge hold but it's not

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.060 
to that that edge hold but it's not
gonna<00:02:24.660> be<00:02:24.780> anything<00:02:24.930> too<00:02:25.140> crazy<00:02:25.320> torsional

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.070 
gonna be anything too crazy torsional

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:27.710 
gonna be anything too crazy torsional
flex<00:02:26.220> you<00:02:26.940> know<00:02:27.060> so<00:02:27.240> you<00:02:27.330> still<00:02:27.510> get<00:02:27.630> a<00:02:27.660> little

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
flex you know so you still get a little

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:28.970 
flex you know so you still get a little
bit<00:02:27.930> torsional<00:02:28.230> flex<00:02:28.320> out<00:02:28.560> of<00:02:28.650> this<00:02:28.770> thing

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
bit torsional flex out of this thing

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:30.890 
bit torsional flex out of this thing
even<00:02:29.700> though<00:02:29.850> there's<00:02:30.030> that<00:02:30.180> carbon<00:02:30.480> fiber<00:02:30.660> a

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
even though there's that carbon fiber a

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.480 
even though there's that carbon fiber a
carbon<00:02:31.200> fiber<00:02:31.350> really<00:02:31.710> is<00:02:32.100> just<00:02:32.310> there<00:02:32.460> for

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:32.490 
carbon fiber really is just there for

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:35.630 
carbon fiber really is just there for
pop<00:02:32.850> and<00:02:33.210> so<00:02:33.780> stability<00:02:34.020> a<00:02:34.470> few<00:02:35.250> other<00:02:35.370> things

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
pop and so stability a few other things

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.580 
pop and so stability a few other things
with<00:02:35.820> the<00:02:35.910> fiberglass<00:02:36.180> lay<00:02:36.960> up<00:02:37.110> in<00:02:37.230> this<00:02:37.320> board

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
with the fiberglass lay up in this board

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.070 
with the fiberglass lay up in this board
it<00:02:38.040> has<00:02:38.220> a<00:02:38.250> by<00:02:38.490> ax<00:02:38.700> and<00:02:39.000> a<00:02:39.090> Triax<00:02:39.450> weave<00:02:39.960> them

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
it has a by ax and a Triax weave them

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.260 
it has a by ax and a Triax weave them
class<00:02:40.350> so<00:02:41.070> what<00:02:41.130> that<00:02:41.250> means<00:02:41.460> is<00:02:41.670> that<00:02:41.700> by<00:02:41.970> X<00:02:42.150> is

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270 
class so what that means is that by X is

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:44.420 
class so what that means is that by X is
just<00:02:42.450> a<00:02:42.570> two<00:02:42.750> way<00:02:42.960> at<00:02:43.410> 90<00:02:43.710> degrees<00:02:43.980> kind<00:02:44.250> of<00:02:44.310> to

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
just a two way at 90 degrees kind of to

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.040 
just a two way at 90 degrees kind of to
a<00:02:44.460> weave<00:02:44.730> which<00:02:45.210> is<00:02:45.330> kind<00:02:45.480> of<00:02:45.510> a<00:02:45.600> really<00:02:45.720> soft

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
a weave which is kind of a really soft

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:48.620 
a weave which is kind of a really soft
and<00:02:46.260> forgiving<00:02:46.740> layup<00:02:47.430> of<00:02:47.580> fiberglass<00:02:48.030> and

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
and forgiving layup of fiberglass and

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.660 
and forgiving layup of fiberglass and
then<00:02:48.780> also<00:02:48.960> has<00:02:49.170> a<00:02:49.200> Triax<00:02:49.740> weave<00:02:50.310> on<00:02:50.550> the

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
then also has a Triax weave on the

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.490 
then also has a Triax weave on the
bottom<00:02:51.060> it's<00:02:51.480> the<00:02:51.510> bottom<00:02:51.810> layer<00:02:51.990> fiberglass

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
bottom it's the bottom layer fiberglass

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.230 
bottom it's the bottom layer fiberglass
is<00:02:52.710> a<00:02:52.740> three-way<00:02:53.130> weave<00:02:53.340> so<00:02:53.940> that<00:02:54.030> is<00:02:54.120> this<00:02:54.210> a

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:54.240 
is a three-way weave so that is this a

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.360 
is a three-way weave so that is this a
little<00:02:54.360> more<00:02:54.510> responsive<00:02:55.170> in<00:02:55.890> general<00:02:56.280> so

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
little more responsive in general so

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:57.740 
little more responsive in general so
that<00:02:56.430> top<00:02:56.730> part<00:02:57.000> is<00:02:57.150> gonna<00:02:57.240> be<00:02:57.420> a<00:02:57.450> little<00:02:57.600> bit

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
that top part is gonna be a little bit

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.840 
that top part is gonna be a little bit
softer<00:02:58.080> a<00:02:58.110> bit<00:02:58.320> more<00:02:58.470> forgiving<00:02:59.310> and<00:02:59.400> flexible

00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850 
softer a bit more forgiving and flexible

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:01.520 
softer a bit more forgiving and flexible
then<00:03:00.300> that<00:03:00.420> bottom<00:03:00.750> is<00:03:00.810> really<00:03:00.930> gonna<00:03:01.110> hold<00:03:01.380> up

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
then that bottom is really gonna hold up

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:03.350 
then that bottom is really gonna hold up
a<00:03:01.560> little<00:03:01.680> bit<00:03:01.800> more<00:03:01.920> to<00:03:02.160> the<00:03:02.580> chatter<00:03:02.880> in<00:03:03.150> the

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
a little bit more to the chatter in the

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:04.760 
a little bit more to the chatter in the
speeds<00:03:03.720> and<00:03:03.960> the<00:03:04.050> landings<00:03:04.380> that<00:03:04.500> you<00:03:04.560> kind<00:03:04.710> of

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:04.770 
speeds and the landings that you kind of

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:06.590 
speeds and the landings that you kind of
put<00:03:04.920> this<00:03:05.040> thing<00:03:05.250> through<00:03:05.310> a<00:03:05.730> few<00:03:06.480> other

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600 
put this thing through a few other

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.870 
put this thing through a few other
details<00:03:06.840> on<00:03:07.290> the<00:03:07.350> capita<00:03:07.650> Outsiders<00:03:08.190> it<00:03:08.670> has<00:03:08.850> a

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
details on the capita Outsiders it has a

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.180 
details on the capita Outsiders it has a
beech<00:03:09.180> wood<00:03:09.390> stringers<00:03:10.020> along<00:03:10.230> the<00:03:10.380> edges<00:03:10.710> so

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
beech wood stringers along the edges so

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.490 
beech wood stringers along the edges so
that's<00:03:11.340> just<00:03:11.400> a<00:03:11.550> denser<00:03:11.970> wood<00:03:12.720> overall<00:03:13.200> and

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
that's just a denser wood overall and

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:14.720 
that's just a denser wood overall and
what<00:03:13.680> that<00:03:13.860> does<00:03:14.040> is<00:03:14.220> just<00:03:14.370> kind<00:03:14.490> of<00:03:14.550> give<00:03:14.640> it<00:03:14.700> a

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
what that does is just kind of give it a

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:16.520 
what that does is just kind of give it a
little<00:03:14.760> more<00:03:14.940> control<00:03:15.300> on<00:03:15.330> the<00:03:15.630> edges<00:03:15.960> holds

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
little more control on the edges holds

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:17.780 
little more control on the edges holds
up<00:03:16.620> a<00:03:16.650> little<00:03:16.830> bit<00:03:16.950> more<00:03:17.100> impact<00:03:17.310> and<00:03:17.760> just

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
up a little bit more impact and just

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:19.310 
up a little bit more impact and just
kind<00:03:18.000> of<00:03:18.030> transfers<00:03:18.510> you<00:03:18.930> know<00:03:19.020> the<00:03:19.110> power

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:19.320 
kind of transfers you know the power

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:20.270 
kind of transfers you know the power
that<00:03:19.380> you<00:03:19.560> have<00:03:19.770> when<00:03:19.950> you're<00:03:19.980> trying<00:03:20.190> to

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
that you have when you're trying to

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.130 
that you have when you're trying to
drive<00:03:20.400> that<00:03:20.670> snowboard<00:03:21.030> to<00:03:21.420> the<00:03:21.570> edge<00:03:21.720> and

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
drive that snowboard to the edge and

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:23.979 
drive that snowboard to the edge and
that's<00:03:22.290> your<00:03:22.410> contact<00:03:22.830> point<00:03:23.100> on<00:03:23.340> the<00:03:23.790> board

00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:23.989 
that's your contact point on the board

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:26.990 
that's your contact point on the board
lastly<00:03:24.989> it<00:03:25.320> has<00:03:25.380> a<00:03:25.500> waxen<00:03:25.950> to<00:03:26.070> use<00:03:26.190> base<00:03:26.459> so

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
lastly it has a waxen to use base so

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.090 
lastly it has a waxen to use base so
that<00:03:27.150> wax<00:03:27.420> is<00:03:27.570> gonna<00:03:27.750> just<00:03:28.680> kind<00:03:28.830> of<00:03:28.890> stay<00:03:29.070> in

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.100 
that wax is gonna just kind of stay in

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.280
