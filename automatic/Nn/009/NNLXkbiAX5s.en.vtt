further<00:01:11.729> into<00:01:12.090> catabolism<00:01:12.810> now<00:01:13.320> there<00:01:13.560> is<00:01:13.710> an

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
further into catabolism now there is an

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.070 
further into catabolism now there is an
anabolic<00:01:14.220> component<00:01:14.729> to<00:01:14.820> it<00:01:14.970> but<00:01:15.540> my

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
anabolic component to it but my

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.920 
anabolic component to it but my
invitation<00:01:16.650> to<00:01:16.680> you<00:01:16.830> would<00:01:17.759> be<00:01:17.790> to<00:01:18.090> back<00:01:18.630> off

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
invitation to you would be to back off

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.070 
invitation to you would be to back off
all<00:01:19.290> the<00:01:19.890> high<00:01:20.189> catabolic<00:01:21.119> activities<00:01:21.960> that

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
all the high catabolic activities that

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.140 
all the high catabolic activities that
you're<00:01:22.290> engaged<00:01:22.710> in<00:01:23.009> just<00:01:23.670> for<00:01:23.939> a<00:01:24.000> little

you're engaged in just for a little
while<00:01:24.270> so<00:01:24.720> that<00:01:24.869> your<00:01:24.990> hormones<00:01:25.229> can<00:01:25.560> balance

itself out I talk a lot about this with
my<00:01:28.259> brother<00:01:28.500> talks<00:01:28.710> a<00:01:28.799> lot<00:01:28.890> about<00:01:28.950> this<00:01:29.250> in

my brother talks a lot about this in
this<00:01:29.509> report<00:01:30.509> that<00:01:30.600> we<00:01:30.689> created<00:01:31.020> it's<00:01:31.170> down

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
this report that we created it's down

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.590 
this report that we created it's down
below<00:01:31.500> called<00:01:31.829> anabolic<00:01:32.759> advantage<00:01:33.299> but<00:01:33.509> it

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
below called anabolic advantage but it

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.300 
below called anabolic advantage but it
requires<00:01:34.170> that<00:01:34.380> you<00:01:34.560> pay<00:01:34.860> very<00:01:34.890> close

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
requires that you pay very close

catabolic<00:02:24.160> right<00:02:24.459> you<00:02:24.580> want<00:02:24.760> to<00:02:24.819> push

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
catabolic right you want to push

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.610 
catabolic right you want to push

yourself too far in either direction and

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.580 
yourself too far in either direction and
right<00:02:27.520> now<00:02:27.730> your<00:02:28.420> catabolism<00:02:29.019> is<00:02:29.230> way<00:02:29.530> too

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
right now your catabolism is way too

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:31.170 
right now your catabolism is way too
heavy<00:02:30.160> so<00:02:30.370> you're<00:02:30.519> going<00:02:30.700> to<00:02:30.790> need<00:02:30.940> to<00:02:31.030> engage

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
heavy so you're going to need to engage

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.390 
heavy so you're going to need to engage
in<00:02:31.330> activities<00:02:31.959> that<00:02:32.380> stimulate<00:02:32.920> anabolism

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
in activities that stimulate anabolism

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.750 
in activities that stimulate anabolism
right<00:02:34.269> that<00:02:34.450> stimulates<00:02:34.840> growth<00:02:35.670> working<00:02:36.670> out

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
right that stimulates growth working out

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:37.920 
right that stimulates growth working out
doesn't<00:02:37.060> stimulate<00:02:37.180> growth<00:02:37.390> how<00:02:37.690> do<00:02:37.750> you<00:02:37.840> guys

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
doesn't stimulate growth how do you guys

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:39.750 
doesn't stimulate growth how do you guys
I<00:02:37.959> don't<00:02:38.110> know<00:02:38.200> that<00:02:38.350> working<00:02:39.160> working<00:02:39.670> out

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
I don't know that working working out

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.479 
I don't know that working working out
stimulates<00:02:40.600> breakdown<00:02:41.220> catabolism<00:02:42.220> and

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:42.489 
stimulates breakdown catabolism and

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:44.640 
stimulates breakdown catabolism and
that's<00:02:42.640> okay<00:02:42.910> we<00:02:43.060> want<00:02:43.300> that<00:02:43.450> so<00:02:43.930> that<00:02:44.110> we<00:02:44.500> can

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
that's okay we want that so that we can

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:46.620 
that's okay we want that so that we can
create<00:02:45.040> a<00:02:45.250> situation<00:02:45.489> where<00:02:45.819> animalism<00:02:46.360> comes

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:46.630 
create a situation where animalism comes

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:48.720 
create a situation where animalism comes
back<00:02:46.870> but<00:02:47.350> now<00:02:47.500> you've<00:02:47.680> gone<00:02:47.890> way<00:02:48.430> too<00:02:48.459> far

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
back but now you've gone way too far

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:50.640 
back but now you've gone way too far
down<00:02:49.180> this<00:02:49.390> road<00:02:49.630> and<00:02:49.780> it<00:02:49.900> ends<00:02:50.170> up<00:02:50.260> happening

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650 
down this road and it ends up happening

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:53.160 
down this road and it ends up happening
when<00:02:50.920> you're<00:02:51.190> doing<00:02:51.519> a<00:02:51.640> lot<00:02:52.269> of<00:02:52.390> cardio<00:02:52.780> you

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170 
when you're doing a lot of cardio you

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:55.170 
when you're doing a lot of cardio you
can<00:02:53.200> push<00:02:53.500> yourself<00:02:53.620> into<00:02:54.069> this<00:02:54.190> into<00:02:55.150> this

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
can push yourself into this into this

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:56.970 
can push yourself into this into this
ditch<00:02:55.540> and<00:02:55.750> it's<00:02:55.870> okay<00:02:56.170> as<00:02:56.530> long<00:02:56.769> as<00:02:56.920> you

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
ditch and it's okay as long as you

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:58.380 
ditch and it's okay as long as you
understand<00:02:57.400> how<00:02:57.730> the<00:02:57.790> nervous<00:02:58.060> system<00:02:58.150> works

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390 
understand how the nervous system works

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:01.229 
understand how the nervous system works
and<00:02:58.690> you<00:02:58.840> and<00:02:59.650> you<00:02:59.769> and<00:02:59.800> you<00:03:00.250> afford<00:03:00.940> your<00:03:01.060> body

00:03:03.539 --> 00:03:03.549 
the chance to become antibiotic again so

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:05.220 
the chance to become antibiotic again so

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:12.160 
back a few steps back so that you can

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.130 
back a few steps back so that you can
take<00:03:12.310> a<00:03:12.340> few<00:03:12.579> steps<00:03:12.790> forward<00:03:13.060> and<00:03:13.450> that's

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780 
stop the cardio if you need to get your

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:29.390 
stop the cardio if you need to get your
heart<00:03:25.959> pumping<00:03:26.109> do<00:03:26.709> very<00:03:27.250> short<00:03:27.700> bouts<00:03:28.060> of

heart pumping do very short bouts of
high<00:03:30.400> intensity<00:03:30.700> interval<00:03:31.120> training<00:03:31.150> like<00:03:31.540> 10

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:32.140 
high intensity interval training like 10

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:34.860 
high intensity interval training like 10
seconds<00:03:32.650> on<00:03:32.799> a<00:03:33.130> minute<00:03:33.820> off<00:03:34.000> or<00:03:34.480> min<00:03:34.660> and<00:03:34.810> a

seconds on a minute off or min and a
half<00:03:34.900> off<00:03:35.500> like<00:03:35.769> really<00:03:36.430> crushing<00:03:36.760> it<00:03:36.850> and

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:36.970 
half off like really crushing it and

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:39.990 
half off like really crushing it and
then<00:03:37.120> relaxing<00:03:37.989> right<00:03:38.290> and<00:03:38.609> take<00:03:39.609> your<00:03:39.790> weight

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.000 
then relaxing right and take your weight

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.860 
then relaxing right and take your weight

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.040 
moderate intensity which is probably is

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:46.289 
moderate intensity which is probably is
if<00:03:45.220> you're<00:03:45.340> building<00:03:45.459> muscle<00:03:45.820> it's<00:03:46.120> going<00:03:46.239> to

00:03:46.289 --> 00:03:46.299 
if you're building muscle it's going to

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:48.030 
if you're building muscle it's going to
be<00:03:46.390> higher<00:03:46.690> volume<00:03:47.200> moderate<00:03:47.650> to<00:03:47.829> low

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:48.040 
be higher volume moderate to low

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:51.990 
be higher volume moderate to low
intensity<00:03:48.459> and<00:03:49.140> switch<00:03:50.140> it<00:03:50.320> to<00:03:51.280> higher

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:52.000

intensity and switch it to higher
intensity<00:03:52.450> lower<00:03:53.140> volume<00:03:53.709> so<00:03:53.980> you're<00:03:54.100> going

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:54.220 
intensity lower volume so you're going

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:57.030 
intensity lower volume so you're going

that's<00:04:00.430> more<00:04:00.549> power<00:04:00.790> lifting<00:04:01.269> based<00:04:01.600> I<00:04:02.100> would

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:03.100 
that's more power lifting based I would

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:05.780 
that's more power lifting based I would
give<00:04:03.220> myself<00:04:03.459> a<00:04:03.820> good<00:04:04.000> four<00:04:04.390> to<00:04:04.420> six<00:04:04.690> weeks

that<00:04:31.710> so<00:04:31.889> that's<00:04:32.280> it<00:04:32.580> the<00:04:33.270> main<00:04:33.449> thing<00:04:33.690> is<00:04:33.870> if

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:34.020 
that so that's it the main thing is if

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:35.689 
that so that's it the main thing is if
you're<00:04:34.169> going<00:04:34.380> to<00:04:34.620> get<00:04:35.070> out<00:04:35.190> of<00:04:35.310> this<00:04:35.430> ditch

00:04:35.689 --> 00:04:35.699 
you're going to get out of this ditch

00:04:35.699 --> 00:04:37.879 
you're going to get out of this ditch
you<00:04:36.000> need<00:04:36.120> to<00:04:36.210> become<00:04:36.479> more<00:04:36.600> anabolic<00:04:37.260> right

00:04:37.879 --> 00:04:37.889 
you need to become more anabolic right

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:39.500 
you need to become more anabolic right
now<00:04:38.010> you're<00:04:38.160> tired<00:04:38.400> and<00:04:38.639> the<00:04:39.060> tendency<00:04:39.479> for

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:39.510 
now you're tired and the tendency for

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:41.390 
now you're tired and the tendency for
tired<00:04:39.870> people<00:04:40.080> is<00:04:40.440> to<00:04:40.740> push<00:04:40.919> harder<00:04:41.280> and

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:41.400 
tired people is to push harder and

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:42.260 
tired people is to push harder and
you're<00:04:41.580> just<00:04:41.669> going<00:04:41.789> to<00:04:41.850> push<00:04:41.970> yourself

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:42.270 
you're just going to push yourself

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:43.670 
you're just going to push yourself
further<00:04:42.419> and<00:04:42.660> further<00:04:42.750> further<00:04:43.080> down<00:04:43.650> that

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:43.680 
further and further further down that

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.040 
further and further further down that
catabolic<00:04:44.280> spiral<00:04:44.729> you<00:04:45.570> really<00:04:45.810> actually

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:46.050 
catabolic spiral you really actually

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:46.850 
catabolic spiral you really actually
back<00:04:46.320> off

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:46.860 
back off

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:49.340 
back off
so<00:04:47.580> the<00:04:47.760> energy<00:04:48.120> comes<00:04:48.330> back<00:04:48.600> but<00:04:48.870> you<00:04:49.020> can<00:04:49.139> eat

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:49.350 
so the energy comes back but you can eat

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:50.960 
so the energy comes back but you can eat
it<00:04:49.530> by<00:04:49.830> changing<00:04:50.250> in<00:04:50.310> your<00:04:50.400> program<00:04:50.699> the<00:04:50.820> way<00:04:50.910> I

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:50.970 
it by changing in your program the way I

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:55.699 
it by changing in your program the way I
just<00:04:51.000> described<00:04:51.570> good<00:04:52.050> luck<00:04:52.229> yo<00:04:53.160> Eliot
