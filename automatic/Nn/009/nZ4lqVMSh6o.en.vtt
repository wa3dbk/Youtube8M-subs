admitting valve what this latest it does

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:03.820 
admitting valve what this latest it does
is<00:03:01.280> it<00:03:01.459> allows<00:03:01.540> air<00:03:02.540> to<00:03:02.570> come<00:03:03.140> in<00:03:03.410> to<00:03:03.680> the

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:03.830 
is it allows air to come in to the

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:06.400 
is it allows air to come in to the
plumbing<00:03:04.220> system<00:03:04.459> so<00:03:05.330> that<00:03:05.540> the<00:03:05.720> trap<00:03:06.050> seal

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:06.410 
plumbing system so that the trap seal

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:09.220 
plumbing system so that the trap seal
will<00:03:06.680> be<00:03:06.830> maintained<00:03:07.430> and<00:03:07.700> sewer<00:03:08.390> gases<00:03:08.720> will

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.230 
will be maintained and sewer gases will

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:12.670 
will be maintained and sewer gases will

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:19.310 
here and I totally destroyed it I cut

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:21.340 
here and I totally destroyed it I cut
the<00:03:19.430> top<00:03:19.640> off<00:03:19.820> of<00:03:19.880> it<00:03:20.120> now<00:03:20.720> this<00:03:20.870> top<00:03:21.140> is

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:21.350 
the top off of it now this top is

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:24.940 
the top off of it now this top is
maintance<00:03:21.980> opposed<00:03:22.280> to<00:03:22.400> maintain<00:03:22.850> a<00:03:23.950> an

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:24.950 
maintance opposed to maintain a an

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:27.280 
maintance opposed to maintain a an
airtight<00:03:25.430> seal<00:03:25.760> all<00:03:26.000> the<00:03:26.030> way<00:03:26.120> around<00:03:26.570> and<00:03:26.750> the

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:27.290 
airtight seal all the way around and the

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:31.330 
airtight seal all the way around and the
way<00:03:27.440> that<00:03:27.709> this<00:03:27.920> works<00:03:28.370> is<00:03:29.230> that<00:03:30.230> in<00:03:30.739> this<00:03:31.040> cap

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340 
way that this works is that in this cap

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:39.190 
way that this works is that in this cap
we<00:03:31.670> have<00:03:31.940> a<00:03:32.269> stem<00:03:33.260> and<00:03:34.030> on<00:03:35.030> this<00:03:38.200> gasket

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:39.200 
we have a stem and on this gasket

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.710 
we have a stem and on this gasket
assembly<00:03:39.920> we<00:03:40.489> have<00:03:40.610> a<00:03:40.640> stem<00:03:41.000> guide<00:03:41.299> so<00:03:41.690> that

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:41.720 
assembly we have a stem guide so that

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:44.410 
assembly we have a stem guide so that
stem<00:03:42.230> guide<00:03:42.470> rides<00:03:42.860> up<00:03:43.220> and<00:03:43.430> down<00:03:43.640> inside<00:03:44.360> the

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:44.420 
stem guide rides up and down inside the

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:47.770 
stem guide rides up and down inside the
stem<00:03:44.959> so<00:03:45.230> it<00:03:45.350> can<00:03:45.530> go<00:03:45.709> move<00:03:46.430> up<00:03:46.670> and<00:03:46.850> down<00:03:47.030> very

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:47.780 
stem so it can go move up and down very

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:50.890 
stem so it can go move up and down very
freely<00:03:48.320> I<00:03:48.350> might<00:03:48.650> say<00:03:48.890> and<00:03:49.390> then<00:03:50.390> at<00:03:50.540> the<00:03:50.660> base

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:50.900 
freely I might say and then at the base

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:53.370 
freely I might say and then at the base
of<00:03:50.930> this<00:03:51.290> valve<00:03:51.560> right<00:03:52.010> here<00:03:52.070> we<00:03:52.610> have<00:03:52.790> a<00:03:52.820> seat

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:53.380 
of this valve right here we have a seat

00:03:53.380 --> 00:04:00.220 
of this valve right here we have a seat
that<00:03:54.380> this<00:03:55.390> rubber<00:03:56.390> seal<00:03:57.019> sets<00:03:57.860> on<00:03:58.100> and<00:03:59.230> then

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:00.230 
that this rubber seal sets on and then

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:04.509 
that this rubber seal sets on and then
we<00:04:00.620> have<00:04:01.690> ports<00:04:02.690> on<00:04:02.900> the<00:04:03.049> side<00:04:03.260> so<00:04:04.100> that<00:04:04.340> when

00:04:04.509 --> 00:04:04.519 
we have ports on the side so that when

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:10.360 
we have ports on the side so that when
this<00:04:04.989> seal<00:04:05.989> lifts<00:04:06.739> up<00:04:07.060> it<00:04:08.060> allows<00:04:08.420> air<00:04:09.370> from

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:10.370 
this seal lifts up it allows air from

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:13.930 
this seal lifts up it allows air from
inside<00:04:11.299> your<00:04:11.510> home<00:04:11.720> to<00:04:12.470> come<00:04:12.709> up<00:04:12.890> inside<00:04:13.370> the

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:13.940 
inside your home to come up inside the

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:17.020 
inside your home to come up inside the
valve<00:04:14.209> and<00:04:14.510> then<00:04:15.459> enter<00:04:16.459> into

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:17.030 
valve and then enter into

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:20.890 
valve and then enter into
the<00:04:17.440> venting<00:04:18.440> system<00:04:18.970> here<00:04:19.970> so<00:04:20.630> that<00:04:20.810> it

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:20.900 
the venting system here so that it

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:28.690 
the venting system here so that it
doesn't<00:04:22.990> slide<00:04:23.990> on<00:04:24.200> the<00:04:24.290> track<00:04:25.090> now<00:04:27.310> in<00:04:28.310> theory

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:28.700 
doesn't slide on the track now in theory

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:31.720 
doesn't slide on the track now in theory
and<00:04:29.320> these<00:04:30.320> things<00:04:30.560> do<00:04:30.770> work<00:04:30.980> I<00:04:31.160> mean<00:04:31.340> actually

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:31.730 
and these things do work I mean actually

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:33.810 
and these things do work I mean actually
they're<00:04:31.910> very<00:04:31.940> well<00:04:32.360> made<00:04:32.389> and<00:04:32.600> they<00:04:32.900> do<00:04:32.960> work

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:33.820 
they're very well made and they do work

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:38.320 
they're very well made and they do work
but<00:04:34.820> they<00:04:35.450> are<00:04:35.660> mechanical<00:04:37.330> anything

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:38.330 
but they are mechanical anything

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:42.190 
but they are mechanical anything
mechanical<00:04:39.230> can<00:04:39.710> and<00:04:40.190> will<00:04:40.460> break<00:04:41.110> the<00:04:42.110> other

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:42.200 
mechanical can and will break the other

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:46.120 
mechanical can and will break the other
thing<00:04:42.470> is<00:04:42.680> this<00:04:42.830> this<00:04:43.190> is<00:04:43.400> rubber<00:04:44.110> rubber<00:04:45.130> will

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:46.130 
thing is this this is rubber rubber will

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:50.950 
thing is this this is rubber rubber will
rot<00:04:46.430> away<00:04:46.460> eventually<00:04:47.919> leaving<00:04:49.000> the<00:04:50.000> vent<00:04:50.270> or

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:50.960 
rot away eventually leaving the vent or

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:54.850 
rot away eventually leaving the vent or
sewer<00:04:51.320> gases<00:04:52.180> to<00:04:53.180> be<00:04:53.330> able<00:04:53.419> to<00:04:53.660> escape<00:04:53.930> through

cause it to stay open critters that live

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:18.640 
cause it to stay open critters that live
inside<00:05:15.440> the<00:05:15.770> inside<00:05:16.669> the<00:05:16.729> sewer<00:05:17.650> cockroaches

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:18.650 
inside the inside the sewer cockroaches

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:20.110 
inside the inside the sewer cockroaches
things<00:05:18.919> of<00:05:19.070> this<00:05:19.160> nature<00:05:19.220> we<00:05:19.940> have<00:05:20.030> a

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:20.120 
things of this nature we have a

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:21.940 
things of this nature we have a
cockroach<00:05:20.810> wants<00:05:21.140> to<00:05:21.229> come<00:05:21.410> up<00:05:21.440> through<00:05:21.740> that

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:21.950 
cockroach wants to come up through that

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:24.159 
cockroach wants to come up through that
this<00:05:22.550> this<00:05:22.880> hole<00:05:23.090> here<00:05:23.360> which<00:05:23.720> is<00:05:23.900> the<00:05:23.990> bigger

00:05:24.159 --> 00:05:24.169 
this this hole here which is the bigger

00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:26.290 
this this hole here which is the bigger
slot<00:05:24.500> up<00:05:24.680> on<00:05:24.830> the<00:05:24.919> side<00:05:25.130> let's<00:05:25.790> say<00:05:25.910> he<00:05:26.030> crawls

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:26.300 
slot up on the side let's say he crawls

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:28.930 
slot up on the side let's say he crawls
up<00:05:26.540> in<00:05:26.690> there<00:05:26.870> and<00:05:27.050> this<00:05:27.650> air<00:05:28.160> admittin<00:05:28.669> valve

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:28.940 
up in there and this air admittin valve

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:31.570 
up in there and this air admittin valve
is<00:05:29.210> open<00:05:29.630> well<00:05:30.410> it's<00:05:30.590> and<00:05:30.800> he<00:05:30.919> tries<00:05:31.220> to<00:05:31.250> escape

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:31.580 
is open well it's and he tries to escape

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:34.420 
is open well it's and he tries to escape
and<00:05:32.090> this<00:05:32.300> comes<00:05:32.539> down<00:05:32.780> and<00:05:33.080> and<00:05:33.830> now<00:05:34.190> he's<00:05:34.400> uh

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:34.430 
and this comes down and and now he's uh

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:38.680 
and this comes down and and now he's uh
now<00:05:35.240> he's<00:05:35.390> caught<00:05:36.970> don't<00:05:37.970> leave<00:05:38.180> that<00:05:38.360> valve

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:38.690 
now he's caught don't leave that valve

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:42.700 
now he's caught don't leave that valve
open<00:05:39.289> like<00:05:39.470> so<00:05:40.150> so<00:05:41.150> gases<00:05:42.110> will<00:05:42.289> be<00:05:42.320> able<00:05:42.650> to

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:42.710 
open like so so gases will be able to

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:45.790 
open like so so gases will be able to
escape<00:05:43.330> the<00:05:44.330> other<00:05:44.450> thing<00:05:44.750> is<00:05:44.930> is<00:05:45.140> on<00:05:45.350> the<00:05:45.590> top

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:45.800 
escape the other thing is is on the top

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:49.000 
escape the other thing is is on the top
of<00:05:45.830> this<00:05:46.190> valve<00:05:46.490> the<00:05:47.500> little<00:05:48.500> critters<00:05:48.830> can

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:49.010 
of this valve the little critters can

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:52.960 
of this valve the little critters can
crawl<00:05:49.550> in<00:05:49.789> around<00:05:50.150> gather<00:05:51.020> in<00:05:51.320> on<00:05:51.530> top<00:05:51.890> of<00:05:52.430> that

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:52.970 
crawl in around gather in on top of that

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:55.960 
crawl in around gather in on top of that
device<00:05:53.330> they<00:05:54.050> can<00:05:54.200> sit<00:05:54.410> there<00:05:54.680> die<00:05:55.250> whatever

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:55.970 
device they can sit there die whatever

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:58.570 
device they can sit there die whatever
and<00:05:56.620> what<00:05:57.620> they're<00:05:57.770> doing<00:05:58.039> then<00:05:58.220> is<00:05:58.400> there

00:05:58.570 --> 00:05:58.580 
and what they're doing then is there

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:02.310 
and what they're doing then is there
adding<00:05:59.000> applying<00:05:59.479> additional<00:06:00.169> weight<00:06:00.410> to<00:06:01.250> the

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:02.320 
adding applying additional weight to the

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:07.240 
adding applying additional weight to the
top<00:06:03.320> of<00:06:03.710> this<00:06:03.860> diaphragm<00:06:04.789> so<00:06:05.360> now<00:06:06.200> when<00:06:06.830> you

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:07.250 
top of this diaphragm so now when you

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:12.370 
top of this diaphragm so now when you
get<00:06:07.550> the<00:06:08.140> draw<00:06:09.140> from<00:06:09.650> the<00:06:10.400> waste<00:06:10.850> line<00:06:11.150> to<00:06:12.050> open

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:12.380 
get the draw from the waste line to open

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:14.800 
get the draw from the waste line to open
the<00:06:12.950> bow<00:06:13.130> bub

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:14.810 
the bow bub

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:17.800 
the bow bub
it's<00:06:15.200> too<00:06:15.440> heavy<00:06:15.620> it<00:06:15.830> won't<00:06:16.370> pick<00:06:16.550> up<00:06:17.030> but

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:17.810 
it's too heavy it won't pick up but

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:19.510 
it's too heavy it won't pick up but
anyway<00:06:18.110> so<00:06:18.169> like<00:06:18.530> I<00:06:18.620> said<00:06:18.680> these<00:06:18.950> are<00:06:19.010> very

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:19.520 
anyway so like I said these are very

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:21.070 
anyway so like I said these are very
well<00:06:19.760> designed

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:21.080 
well designed

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:24.540 
well designed
and<00:06:21.409> they<00:06:21.620> do<00:06:21.680> work<00:06:22.129> but<00:06:23.030> they<00:06:23.449> are<00:06:23.599> dangerous

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:24.550 
and they do work but they are dangerous

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:26.559 
and they do work but they are dangerous
like<00:06:25.550> I<00:06:25.580> said<00:06:25.789> the<00:06:25.849> way<00:06:26.000> that<00:06:26.030> these<00:06:26.389> things

00:06:26.559 --> 00:06:26.569 
like I said the way that these things

00:06:26.569 --> 00:06:30.219 
like I said the way that these things
work<00:06:26.870> is<00:06:27.080> once<00:06:27.379> once<00:06:28.340> the<00:06:28.690> we<00:06:29.690> pull<00:06:29.900> a<00:06:29.930> vacuum

00:06:30.219 --> 00:06:30.229 
work is once once the we pull a vacuum

00:06:30.229 --> 00:06:34.570 
work is once once the we pull a vacuum
basically<00:06:31.099> from<00:06:31.819> the<00:06:32.919> bite<00:06:33.919> by<00:06:34.190> the<00:06:34.250> water

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:34.580 
basically from the bite by the water

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:39.520 
basically from the bite by the water
draining<00:06:34.970> out<00:06:35.210> of<00:06:35.330> the<00:06:35.449> sink<00:06:35.750> the<00:06:38.110> seal<00:06:39.110> here

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:39.530 
draining out of the sink the seal here

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:41.920 
draining out of the sink the seal here
will<00:06:39.949> rise<00:06:40.430> up<00:06:40.789> because<00:06:41.150> this<00:06:41.360> is<00:06:41.539> the<00:06:41.690> seal

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:41.930 
will rise up because this is the seal

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:45.450 
will rise up because this is the seal
unit<00:06:42.560> it<00:06:42.860> will<00:06:43.159> rise<00:06:43.490> up<00:06:43.849> inside<00:06:44.180> the<00:06:44.599> unit<00:06:44.930> and

00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:45.460 
unit it will rise up inside the unit and

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:51.999 
unit it will rise up inside the unit and
allow<00:06:46.460> the<00:06:47.710> air<00:06:48.710> to<00:06:48.740> be<00:06:49.340> introduced<00:06:50.150> into<00:06:51.009> the

00:06:51.999 --> 00:06:52.009 
allow the air to be introduced into the

00:06:52.009 --> 00:06:54.129 
allow the air to be introduced into the
venting<00:06:52.340> system<00:06:52.370> and<00:06:52.879> then<00:06:53.300> once<00:06:53.599> the

00:06:54.129 --> 00:06:54.139 
venting system and then once the

00:06:54.139 --> 00:06:56.920 
venting system and then once the
pressure<00:06:54.440> is<00:06:54.680> equal<00:06:55.009> it<00:06:55.909> will<00:06:56.210> drop<00:06:56.479> back<00:06:56.719> down

00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:56.930 
pressure is equal it will drop back down

00:06:56.930 --> 00:07:00.640 
pressure is equal it will drop back down
into<00:06:56.990> place<00:06:58.210> but<00:06:59.210> the<00:06:59.569> like<00:07:00.289> I<00:07:00.319> said<00:07:00.409> the

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:00.650 
into place but the like I said the

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:03.670 
into place but the like I said the
videos<00:07:01.009> that<00:07:01.039> follow<00:07:01.389> I'm<00:07:02.389> sure<00:07:03.050> you'll<00:07:03.289> find

00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:03.680 
videos that follow I'm sure you'll find

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:10.220 
videos that follow I'm sure you'll find
to<00:07:04.310> be<00:07:04.840> there<00:07:05.840> pretty<00:07:06.080> elaborate<00:07:06.440> but<00:07:06.949> I<00:07:07.960> think

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:10.230 
to be there pretty elaborate but I think

00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:16.309 
to be there pretty elaborate but I think
going<00:07:10.470> across<00:07:10.560> and<00:07:11.280> I<00:07:12.120> hope<00:07:12.330> that<00:07:12.540> you

00:07:16.309 --> 00:07:16.319 

00:07:16.319 --> 00:07:19.769 

raises<00:07:17.319> your<00:07:17.529> concern<00:07:18.099> about<00:07:18.729> these<00:07:19.239> being

00:07:19.769 --> 00:07:19.779 
raises your concern about these being

00:07:19.779 --> 00:07:23.849 
raises your concern about these being
allowed<00:07:20.049> to<00:07:20.109> be<00:07:20.379> installed<00:07:20.649> that<00:07:21.369> you<00:07:21.639> can
