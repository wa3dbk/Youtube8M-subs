00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:11.090
 with this video article I intend to explain the impact that our style has 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:14.990
 of life that includes nutrition physical activity work and relationships 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:19.830
 social to its production modulation of a whole series of hormones that affect 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.109
 directly on our body composition 

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:25.830
 let's start by treating it in generic mode topics 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.290
 speaking of the general repercussions, they can result in true and 

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:31.440
 own pathologies 

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:34.790
 Western lifestyles produce in our species 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:39.740
 I will then continue the report by discussing it more thoroughly instead 

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:43.650
 connection for hormones type of training and body composition 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:45.420
 billings method 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.250
 It has been well documented that the CRF has made me the king of release of the court against 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:50.970

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:55.070
 edott to activate peripheral mind system and unitary reducing 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:57.810
 the expression of cytokines such as tnf 

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:01.710
 a factor of tumor necrosis interleukin 1 and six 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:06.380
 still high numbers of fat cells are able to activate further 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.630
 answer of this class of molecules project amatoria 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:14.600
 and bay proved known within the medical community that a lifestyle 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.200
 reckless asp 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.710
 dramatic doors dramatic changes 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:22.920
 not only in terms of health but also of the general physical appearance 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:27.680
 what are the social dynamics that the pathogenesis of 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.030
 today's body composition 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.090
 the exponential growth of psychiatric pathologies 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.650
 of type 2 diabetes mellitus of cardiac hypertension 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:41.200
 of cardiovascular diseases of the metabolic greeting syndrome 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.220
 of sexual dysfunctions are all pathologies that are mainly 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:48.220
 generated by our lifestyle 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:54.760
 78% of US and overweight males from 14 TV and are affected by 

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:57.860
 a low vitality that has become chronic 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:02.600
 it has been estimated that 90% of the adult population is completely 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:03.750
 sedentary 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.100
 such subjects are not do not exceed during their day 

00:02:08.159 --> 00:02:10.899
 the 6000 steps of walking 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:13.999
 male body composition in the united states 

00:02:13.999 --> 00:02:17.139
 is becoming more and more similar to women 

00:02:17.139 --> 00:02:21.109
 with fat accumulations especially in the waist area 

00:02:21.109 --> 00:02:24.959
 that make them always like me the area add pregnant women in the third month 

00:02:25.789 --> 00:02:28.709
 this negative remodeling of the composition mor 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:29.750
 corporeal 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.359
 as a consequence or a remarkable one 

00:02:32.359 --> 00:02:36.909
 a total lack of energy to devote to physical exercise 

00:02:36.909 --> 00:02:40.799
 the need to use the peripheral dilator jar to get one 

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:42.479
 normal sex life 

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:45.209
 anxiety and overweight depression 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:48.720
 mental fatigue in general a compromised quality of life 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.439
 which tends to feed these and other pathologies 

00:02:52.439 --> 00:02:56.400
 speaking scientifically what were the cultural factors they have 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.340
 helped feed this decline in the health of our species 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.289
 homo sapiens sapiens 

00:03:02.289 --> 00:03:05.099
 rome was confirmed that our circle photo 

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:07.519
 it has not changed from buletin to millennia 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:11.109
 what has changed and our social environment that has us 

00:03:11.109 --> 00:03:14.140
 conditioned by an incompatible lifestyle 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:15.600
 with our evolution 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:18.900
 leading us to the pathogenesis of this abnormal phenotype 

00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:23.419
 it seems that the spread of new technologies is more widely accused 

00:03:23.419 --> 00:03:25.159
 for what is happening to us 

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:29.959
 modern technologies may be incomplete antithesis with necessity 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:32.959
 the physical movement of our species 

00:03:33.619 --> 00:03:37.419
 this condition has a heavy impact on our lifestyle 

00:03:37.419 --> 00:03:40.880
 contributed to the remodeling of our cocktail bodies 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:45.040
 and consequently given birth to a new phenotype characterized by low 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:45.890
 vitality 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:46.939
 obesity 

00:03:46.939 --> 00:03:48.710
 emotional instability 

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:52.140
 sexually compromised and often living in a continuous state of 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:54.079
 silent inflammation 

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:58.150
 the inability to understand the incompatibility of certain on the cover 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:02.569
 life choices with our chambery is quickly bringing us to a continuum 

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:05.439
 deterioration and physical transformation 

00:04:05.439 --> 00:04:09.960
 some sociologists, the culprit economists such as malthus 

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:13.530
 at the end of the nineteenth century hypothesize that humanity would have found itself ad 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:14.359
 face up to 

00:04:14.359 --> 00:04:18.209
 big problems due to its continuous growth in the market 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:22.669
 moreover, many other social philosophers have warned us that the 

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:26.060
 our capitalist system could have important repercussions 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:30.419
 on the human body as well as in the surrounding environment 

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:35.770
 marshall mcluhan during the late 50s wrote a number of papers 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:38.940
 brilliantly arguing against television 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:42.350
 in racing the so-called electronic age in relation to the 

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:46.480
 effects that would have had oki would have made on the human psyche 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:51.320
 there are also many studies that outlines a generalized decrease in 

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:52.949
 capacity 

00:04:52.949 --> 00:04:56.389
 of the last generations compared to the previous ones 

00:04:56.389 --> 00:05:00.810
 a lot of research shows us the growing difficulty of our young people 

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:03.810
 to understand the spirits of great thinkers 

00:05:04.389 --> 00:05:07.889
 if we think that the years that at the beginning of the twentieth century were the main objective 

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:10.389
 of compulsory school policies 

00:05:10.389 --> 00:05:13.159
 was to make culture accessible to all 

00:05:13.159 --> 00:05:16.530
 with the aim of making the great majority of virgil works accessible 

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:21.790
 scecspirer humerus and what then so compromises our physical abilities 

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:25.279
 and specific intellectual of our species 

00:05:25.279 --> 00:05:29.270
 because we are willing to let simple factors economic partners 

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:32.270
 so can our nature change for the worse 

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:34.719
 you can try to imagine 

00:05:34.719 --> 00:05:37.020
 to seek only to imagine 

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:41.150
 the nightmare that I live in a 45 year old man looking at himself in the mirror 

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:44.170
 see with a belly similar to that of a pregnant woman 

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:48.510
 what time to resort to viagra will betray normal relationships both sexuality and 

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:50.410
 always the same as you on alessio shoes 

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:52.790
 needs sleeping pills to sleep 

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:56.900
 weight system or skeletal muscle gets atrophied and that its abilities 

00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:59.559
 cognitive are in continuous decline 

00:05:59.559 --> 00:06:03.870
 this relative portrait of millions of Western men is not science fiction 

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:05.379
 even if scary 

00:06:05.379 --> 00:06:08.379
 since it has become the main condition of our species 

00:06:09.119 --> 00:06:12.909
 population studies predict this situation in the future 

00:06:12.909 --> 00:06:15.550
 will tend to a continuous deterioration 

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:16.550
 stress 

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:18.750
 low vitality obesity 

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:21.810
 plurimetabolic syndrome type 2 diabetes mellitus 

00:06:22.409 --> 00:06:25.240
 mental illnesses sexual problems 

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:29.159
 dismetabolism enigma atc ​​inflammatory disorders 

00:06:29.159 --> 00:06:32.449
 have not yet reached their peak 

00:06:32.449 --> 00:06:35.759
 however it has been shown that the modern phenotype can come easily 

00:06:35.759 --> 00:06:37.120
 reverse 

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:41.350
 although some cultural factors while disco rock the realization 

00:06:42.199 --> 00:06:44.000
 I finish the first part here 

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:49.530
 of the obvious ftp pointing between 4 in a few days for the second part like 

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:50.339
 usual 

00:06:50.339 --> 00:06:52.679
 thanks for following me and goodbye
