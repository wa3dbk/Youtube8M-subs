topic that's called counter rhythms

topic that's called counter rhythms
these<00:00:36.310> rhythms<00:00:36.670> are<00:00:36.790> supposed<00:00:37.090> to<00:00:37.240> be

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:37.390 
these rhythms are supposed to be

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:39.330 
these rhythms are supposed to be
functional<00:00:37.900> around<00:00:38.230> each<00:00:38.440> other<00:00:38.680> but<00:00:38.950> I<00:00:38.980> don't

functional around each other but I don't

functional around each other but I don't
quite<00:00:39.670> get<00:00:40.000> the<00:00:40.180> overall<00:00:40.510> idea<00:00:40.840> is<00:00:41.320> it<00:00:41.680> a

00:00:41.729 --> 00:00:41.739 
quite get the overall idea is it a

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:44.010 
quite get the overall idea is it a
variation<00:00:42.340> of<00:00:42.640> an<00:00:42.790> original<00:00:43.060> rhythm<00:00:43.600> or<00:00:43.780> is<00:00:43.900> it

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:44.020 
variation of an original rhythm or is it

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:46.229 
variation of an original rhythm or is it
something<00:00:44.260> else<00:00:44.560> like<00:00:44.860> an<00:00:45.160> improvised<00:00:45.790> rhythm

00:00:46.229 --> 00:00:46.239 
something else like an improvised rhythm

since having excellent rhythm is the

area of layering counter rhythms the

counter rhythm though is a rhythm

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:12.539 
counter rhythm though is a rhythm
performed<00:01:10.570> under<00:01:10.870> an<00:01:11.229> established<00:01:11.920> groove<00:01:12.220> it

performed under an established groove it

performed under an established groove it

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:15.370 
can be composed or improvised but played

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:17.340 
can be composed or improvised but played
accurately<00:01:16.120> the<00:01:16.360> counter<00:01:16.750> rhythm<00:01:17.049> should

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:17.350 
accurately the counter rhythm should

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:19.320 
accurately the counter rhythm should
flow<00:01:17.710> nicely<00:01:18.010> against<00:01:18.610> the<00:01:18.640> established

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:19.330 
flow nicely against the established

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:22.020 
flow nicely against the established
groove<00:01:19.600> without<00:01:20.080> straying<00:01:20.650> too<00:01:20.830> far<00:01:21.040> which

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:22.030 
groove without straying too far which

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:23.700 
groove without straying too far which
could<00:01:22.270> result<00:01:22.450> in<00:01:22.780> a<00:01:22.930> loss<00:01:22.960> of<00:01:23.440> that

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:23.710 
could result in a loss of that

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:26.880 
could result in a loss of that
established<00:01:24.549> groove<00:01:24.880> so<00:01:25.869> to<00:01:25.930> demonstrate<00:01:26.500> the

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:26.890 
established groove so to demonstrate the

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:28.950 
established groove so to demonstrate the
concept<00:01:27.369> I've<00:01:27.580> basically<00:01:28.510> created<00:01:28.810> some

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:28.960 
concept I've basically created some

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:30.600 
concept I've basically created some
examples<00:01:29.530> I'd<00:01:29.650> like<00:01:29.799> to<00:01:29.920> run<00:01:30.100> through<00:01:30.400> so

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:30.610 
examples I'd like to run through so

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:32.940 
examples I'd like to run through so
let's<00:01:30.790> not<00:01:31.060> waste<00:01:31.299> any<00:01:31.600> time<00:01:31.689> and<00:01:32.140> move<00:01:32.530> on<00:01:32.740> to

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:32.950 
let's not waste any time and move on to

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:35.429 
let's not waste any time and move on to
those<00:01:33.100> examples<00:01:33.549> right<00:01:33.909> away<00:01:34.150> in<00:01:34.960> example

those examples right away in example
number<00:01:35.470> one<00:01:35.830> I<00:01:35.860> have<00:01:36.010> established<00:01:36.490> a<00:01:37.060> groove

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:37.420 
number one I have established a groove

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:39.929 
number one I have established a groove
that<00:01:38.110> will<00:01:38.229> be<00:01:38.350> the<00:01:38.439> backing<00:01:38.950> track<00:01:39.250> for<00:01:39.280> other

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:39.939 
that will be the backing track for other

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:42.450 
that will be the backing track for other
counter<00:01:40.540> rhythm<00:01:40.869> examples<00:01:41.470> here<00:01:42.100> it<00:01:42.189> is<00:01:42.280> it

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:42.460 
counter rhythm examples here it is it

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:44.999 
counter rhythm examples here it is it
just<00:01:42.580> moves<00:01:43.330> a<00:01:43.540> four<00:01:44.020> bar<00:01:44.229> progression<00:01:44.860> with

00:01:44.999 --> 00:01:45.009 
just moves a four bar progression with

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:47.940 
just moves a four bar progression with
two<00:01:45.189> bars<00:01:45.460> on<00:01:45.640> a<00:01:45.700> minor<00:01:46.119> and<00:01:46.570> then<00:01:47.229> bars<00:01:47.590> three

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:47.950 
two bars on a minor and then bars three

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:50.280 
two bars on a minor and then bars three
and<00:01:48.070> four<00:01:48.310> will<00:01:48.549> be<00:01:48.670> on<00:01:48.700> a<00:01:48.850> D<00:01:49.150> minor<00:01:49.390> court<00:01:49.840> it

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:50.290 
and four will be on a D minor court it

00:01:50.290 --> 00:02:08.169 
and four will be on a D minor court it
sounds<00:01:50.590> like<00:01:50.710> this<00:01:50.890> one<00:01:51.369> two<00:01:52.119> three<00:01:52.990> four

rhythms execution of the parts is very

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:47.509 
rhythms execution of the parts is very
important<00:03:46.139> you'll<00:03:46.680> need<00:03:46.859> to<00:03:46.950> develop<00:03:47.370> the

00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:47.519

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:49.520 
important you'll need to develop the
phrases<00:03:48.030> both<00:03:48.299> in<00:03:48.510> your<00:03:48.750> mind's<00:03:49.169> so<00:03:49.290> you<00:03:49.379> can

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
phrases both in your mind's so you can

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:51.830 
phrases both in your mind's so you can
hear<00:03:49.769> them<00:03:49.919> clearly<00:03:50.220> as<00:03:50.609> well<00:03:51.209> as<00:03:51.389> being<00:03:51.689> able

the<00:03:54.299> good<00:03:54.510> news<00:03:54.720> is<00:03:54.930> that<00:03:54.959> as<00:03:55.349> you<00:03:55.590> develop

00:03:56.119 --> 00:03:56.129 
the good news is that as you develop

00:03:56.129 --> 00:03:58.220 
the good news is that as you develop
your<00:03:56.159> ability<00:03:56.879> with<00:03:56.909> rhythms<00:03:57.569> and<00:03:57.780> you<00:03:57.870> become

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.230 
your ability with rhythms and you become

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:00.080 
your ability with rhythms and you become
more<00:03:58.590> and<00:03:58.829> more<00:03:58.889> successful<00:03:59.669> with<00:04:00.060> your

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090 
more and more successful with your

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:03.140 
more and more successful with your
technical<00:04:00.780> ability<00:04:01.290> to<00:04:01.769> perform<00:04:02.250> them<00:04:02.430> your

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 
technical ability to perform them your

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.149 
technical ability to perform them your
mind<00:04:03.419> will<00:04:03.599> also<00:04:03.900> develop<00:04:04.139> alongside<00:04:04.560> of<00:04:05.040> that

00:04:05.149 --> 00:04:05.159 
mind will also develop alongside of that

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:07.190 
mind will also develop alongside of that
physical<00:04:05.730> ability<00:04:06.209> then<00:04:06.480> in<00:04:06.599> the<00:04:06.719> end<00:04:06.840> your

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:07.200 
physical ability then in the end your

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.289 
physical ability then in the end your
feeling<00:04:07.889> for<00:04:07.919> this<00:04:08.250> will<00:04:08.430> become<00:04:08.760> so<00:04:09.030> strong

00:04:09.289 --> 00:04:09.299 
feeling for this will become so strong

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:11.479 
feeling for this will become so strong
that<00:04:09.540> you'll<00:04:09.659> begin<00:04:10.040> improvising<00:04:11.040> counter

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:11.489 
that you'll begin improvising counter

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:14.119 
that you'll begin improvising counter
rhythms<00:04:11.819> in<00:04:12.000> real<00:04:12.480> time<00:04:12.780> even<00:04:13.409> live<00:04:13.590> on<00:04:13.799> stage
