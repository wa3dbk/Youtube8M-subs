and lift on too much drag and really

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.180 
and lift on too much drag and really
slow<00:00:36.570> the<00:00:36.630> ball<00:00:36.809> down<00:00:36.870> but<00:00:37.440> too<00:00:37.469> little<00:00:37.800> drag

encasing<00:00:42.510> is<00:00:42.600> really<00:00:42.930> something<00:00:43.290> that

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:43.550 
encasing is really something that

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:45.590 
encasing is really something that
controls<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:44.730> ball<00:00:44.910> as<00:00:45.090> it<00:00:45.210> passes<00:00:45.420> through

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
controls the ball as it passes through

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.600 
controls the ball as it passes through
the<00:00:45.870> air<00:00:45.989> and<00:00:46.200> we've<00:00:46.379> able<00:00:47.039> to<00:00:47.129> develop<00:00:47.520> the

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
the air and we've able to develop the

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.869 
the air and we've able to develop the
casing<00:00:47.969> for<00:00:48.180> the<00:00:48.210> Tino<00:00:48.539> to<00:00:48.600> trace<00:00:48.930> of<00:00:49.140> it<00:00:49.260> is

00:00:49.869 --> 00:00:49.879 
casing for the Tino to trace of it is

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:52.939 
casing for the Tino to trace of it is
aerodynamically<00:00:50.879> more<00:00:51.270> efficient<00:00:51.949> really

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
aerodynamically more efficient really

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.500 
aerodynamically more efficient really
what<00:00:53.100> this<00:00:53.219> does<00:00:53.430> is<00:00:53.610> hold<00:00:53.820> the<00:00:54.059> ball<00:00:54.239> in<00:00:54.449> the

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
what this does is hold the ball in the

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.319 
what this does is hold the ball in the
air<00:00:54.930> and<00:00:55.230> stop<00:00:55.980> it<00:00:56.160> from<00:00:56.340> moving<00:00:56.399> around<00:00:56.969> or

the<00:01:04.199> ball<00:01:04.409> fly<00:01:04.680> through<00:01:04.890> the<00:01:04.920> air<00:01:05.010> straighter

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
the players don't like it really you

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.309

ball and we know we've got a good
football<00:01:47.219> on<00:01:47.250> my<00:01:47.459> hand<00:01:48.739> if<00:01:49.739> you<00:01:49.890> look<00:01:50.039> at

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
football on my hand if you look at

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.459 
football on my hand if you look at
traditional<00:01:50.789> home<00:01:51.329> the<00:01:51.509> scene<00:01:51.719> described<00:01:52.229> if

00:01:52.459 --> 00:01:52.469 
traditional home the scene described if

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:55.100 
traditional home the scene described if
you<00:01:52.619> look<00:01:52.739> at<00:01:52.860> the<00:01:53.039> t90<00:01:53.610> tricep<00:01:54.090> the<00:01:54.299> seams<00:01:55.049> are

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
you look at the t90 tricep the seams are

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.779 
you look at the t90 tricep the seams are
actually<00:01:55.379> curve<00:01:55.619> there<00:01:56.009> is<00:01:56.159> no<00:01:56.310> hot<00:01:56.610> spots

00:01:56.779 --> 00:01:56.789 
actually curve there is no hot spots

00:01:56.789 --> 00:01:58.429 
actually curve there is no hot spots
there's<00:01:57.149> no<00:01:57.239> soft<00:01:57.509> spots<00:01:57.599> and<00:01:57.959> therefore<00:01:58.319> you

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
there's no soft spots and therefore you

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.369 
there's no soft spots and therefore you
create<00:01:58.799> this<00:01:59.239> 360<00:02:00.239> degree<00:02:00.629> sweet<00:02:00.869> spot<00:02:01.079> he

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:01.379 
create this 360 degree sweet spot he

00:02:01.379 --> 00:02:02.749 
create this 360 degree sweet spot he
doesn't<00:02:01.709> matter<00:02:01.860> where<00:02:02.129> you<00:02:02.159> kick<00:02:02.459> the<00:02:02.610> ball

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
doesn't matter where you kick the ball

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:07.160 
doesn't matter where you kick the ball
you<00:02:03.000> get<00:02:03.239> the<00:02:03.329> same<00:02:03.629> responsible<00:02:05.989> the<00:02:06.989> main

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
you get the same responsible the main

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.139 
you get the same responsible the main
issue<00:02:07.200> during<00:02:07.950> the<00:02:08.190> games<00:02:08.399> that<00:02:08.640> there<00:02:08.849> is<00:02:08.940> so

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
graphics were always kind of an

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.460 
graphics were always kind of an
aesthetic<00:02:17.940> treatment<00:02:18.480> we<00:02:18.720> try<00:02:18.959> to<00:02:19.019> look<00:02:19.139> at<00:02:19.319> it

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
aesthetic treatment we try to look at it

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.379 
aesthetic treatment we try to look at it
in<00:02:19.560> a<00:02:19.620> different<00:02:19.650> way<00:02:19.950> visual<00:02:20.639> acuity<00:02:20.910> or<00:02:21.150> the

in a different way visual acuity or the
visual<00:02:21.900> signals<00:02:22.349> will<00:02:22.470> be<00:02:22.680> the<00:02:23.310> ball<00:02:23.489> gives

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
visual signals will be the ball gives

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.309 
visual signals will be the ball gives
off<00:02:23.880> is<00:02:24.180> something<00:02:24.810> that<00:02:24.930> we've<00:02:25.139> been

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:25.319 
off is something that we've been

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:27.289 
off is something that we've been
developing<00:02:25.560> over<00:02:25.950> many<00:02:26.310> years<00:02:26.400> the<00:02:27.030> flicker

00:02:27.289 --> 00:02:27.299 
developing over many years the flicker

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:30.140 
developing over many years the flicker
effect<00:02:27.660> is<00:02:28.099> effectively<00:02:29.099> like<00:02:29.670> a<00:02:29.730> strobe

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
effect is effectively like a strobe

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.150 
effect is effectively like a strobe
light<00:02:30.209> as<00:02:30.810> the<00:02:31.139> ball<00:02:31.319> comes<00:02:31.500> towards<00:02:31.950> you<00:02:31.980> you

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
light as the ball comes towards you you

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:33.650 
light as the ball comes towards you you
get<00:02:32.280> this<00:02:32.459> light<00:02:32.790> dark<00:02:33.030> light<00:02:33.150> dark<00:02:33.269> and

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
get this light dark light dark and

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.629 
get this light dark light dark and
therefore<00:02:34.019> your<00:02:34.590> eyes<00:02:34.799> can<00:02:35.130> see<00:02:35.160> that<00:02:35.459> much

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:35.639 
therefore your eyes can see that much

00:02:35.639 --> 00:02:37.339 
therefore your eyes can see that much
better<00:02:35.880> and<00:02:36.150> much<00:02:36.209> visible<00:02:36.750> players<00:02:37.169> have

it allows them to judge spin by having

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:44.420 
it allows them to judge spin by having
that<00:02:42.269> split<00:02:42.900> second<00:02:43.260> left<00:02:43.410> behind<00:02:43.799> by<00:02:44.099> seeing
