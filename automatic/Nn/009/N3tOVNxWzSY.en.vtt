00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
the biggest trade day maybe the most

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.279 
the biggest trade day maybe the most
players<00:00:18.090> but<00:00:18.420> it's<00:00:18.539> definitely<00:00:18.720> not<00:00:18.990> the<00:00:19.140> most

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
players but it's definitely not the most

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.590 
players but it's definitely not the most
expensive<00:00:19.710> and<00:00:20.160> high-end<00:00:20.640> players<00:00:20.910> but<00:00:21.210> there

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
expensive and high-end players but there

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.060 
expensive and high-end players but there
are<00:00:21.720> a<00:00:21.750> lot<00:00:21.960> of<00:00:21.990> star<00:00:22.350> of<00:00:22.439> the<00:00:22.500> weeks<00:00:22.680> here<00:00:23.039> and

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
are a lot of star of the weeks here and

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.980 
are a lot of star of the weeks here and
a<00:00:23.550> lot<00:00:23.910> of<00:00:23.939> these<00:00:24.090> players<00:00:24.300> I<00:00:24.449> actually<00:00:24.630> felt

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
a lot of these players I actually felt

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.050 
a lot of these players I actually felt
to<00:00:25.109> be<00:00:25.140> really<00:00:25.590> really<00:00:25.680> good<00:00:25.949> and<00:00:26.160> I<00:00:26.519> guess<00:00:26.939> you

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
to be really really good and I guess you

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.330 
to be really really good and I guess you
could<00:00:27.180> say<00:00:27.269> undervalued<00:00:27.930> like<00:00:28.560> ekman-larsson

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
could say undervalued like ekman-larsson

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.749 
could say undervalued like ekman-larsson
is<00:00:29.910> like<00:00:30.090> 20<00:00:30.599> 25<00:00:30.779> k<00:00:31.289> or<00:00:31.410> so<00:00:31.590> but<00:00:32.040> he's<00:00:32.189> he's<00:00:32.610> one

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
is like 20 25 k or so but he's he's one

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.130 
is like 20 25 k or so but he's he's one
of<00:00:32.850> my<00:00:32.910> favorite<00:00:33.239> defenseman<00:00:33.690> sure<00:00:33.870> he's<00:00:33.989> not

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
of my favorite defenseman sure he's not

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.810 
of my favorite defenseman sure he's not
a<00:00:34.170> very<00:00:34.320> good<00:00:34.380> hitter<00:00:34.500> but<00:00:34.920> he's<00:00:35.370> really<00:00:35.520> fast

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
a very good hitter but he's really fast

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.639 
a very good hitter but he's really fast
he's<00:00:36.239> very<00:00:36.450> agile<00:00:36.630> he's<00:00:37.200> just<00:00:37.350> an<00:00:37.410> overall

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
he's very agile he's just an overall

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.369 
he's very agile he's just an overall
great<00:00:37.739> defenseman<00:00:38.430> and<00:00:38.640> for<00:00:39.059> 25k<00:00:39.480> instead<00:00:40.290> of

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
great defenseman and for 25k instead of

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.170 
great defenseman and for 25k instead of
paying<00:00:40.530> like<00:00:40.710> a<00:00:40.890> DK<00:00:41.190> for<00:00:41.399> enough<00:00:41.700> I<00:00:41.879> think<00:00:41.910> he's

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
paying like a DK for enough I think he's

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.910 
paying like a DK for enough I think he's
definitely<00:00:42.570> a<00:00:42.600> lot<00:00:42.750> better<00:00:42.809> if<00:00:43.469> you<00:00:43.590> guys<00:00:43.739> want

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
definitely a lot better if you guys want

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.799 
definitely a lot better if you guys want
