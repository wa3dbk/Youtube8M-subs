00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:06.230 
a lot of the MGS here on this side and

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:09.699 
a lot of the MGS here on this side and
this<00:04:06.349> side<00:04:06.410> and<00:04:07.370> then<00:04:07.640> back<00:04:08.629> further<00:04:09.080> is<00:04:09.379> the<00:04:09.560> H

00:04:09.699 --> 00:04:09.709 
this side and then back further is the H

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:10.990 
this side and then back further is the H
G's<00:04:10.010> and<00:04:10.250> then<00:04:10.340> on<00:04:10.459> the<00:04:10.549> very<00:04:10.730> back<00:04:10.940> wall

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:11.000 
G's and then on the very back wall

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.940 
G's and then on the very back wall
they've<00:04:11.480> got<00:04:11.720> a<00:04:11.750> few<00:04:12.080> like<00:04:12.349> kind<00:04:12.650> of<00:04:12.709> older

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:15.860 
kids and PG is there as well so I'll

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:17.349 
kids and PG is there as well so I'll
just<00:04:16.010> kind<00:04:16.130> of<00:04:16.250> show<00:04:16.459> you<00:04:16.489> a<00:04:16.880> bunch<00:04:17.120> of<00:04:17.209> those

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:17.359 
just kind of show you a bunch of those

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:19.870 
just kind of show you a bunch of those
basically<00:04:18.350> their<00:04:18.620> pricing<00:04:19.100> system<00:04:19.459> here<00:04:19.669> is

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:19.880 
basically their pricing system here is

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:21.909 
basically their pricing system here is
basically<00:04:20.389> taking<00:04:20.780> the<00:04:20.900> list<00:04:21.109> price<00:04:21.410> in<00:04:21.680> yen

00:04:21.909 --> 00:04:21.919 
basically taking the list price in yen

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:24.070 
basically taking the list price in yen
and<00:04:22.160> then<00:04:22.310> multiply<00:04:22.880> that<00:04:22.910> times<00:04:23.360> ten<00:04:23.810> point

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:24.080 
and then multiply that times ten point

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.290 
and then multiply that times ten point
three<00:04:24.139> for<00:04:24.740> T<00:04:25.250> of<00:04:25.310> the<00:04:25.430> Korean<00:04:25.729> Won<00:04:25.910> so<00:04:26.180> it's

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:26.300 
three for T of the Korean Won so it's

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:27.310 
three for T of the Korean Won so it's
just<00:04:26.389> a<00:04:26.540> little<00:04:26.780> bit<00:04:26.900> higher<00:04:27.050> than<00:04:27.229> the

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:27.320 
just a little bit higher than the

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:30.010 
just a little bit higher than the
Japanese<00:04:27.680> list<00:04:27.919> price<00:04:28.130> which<00:04:28.910> is<00:04:29.090> not<00:04:29.780> too<00:04:29.990> bad

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:30.020 
Japanese list price which is not too bad

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:32.379 
Japanese list price which is not too bad
