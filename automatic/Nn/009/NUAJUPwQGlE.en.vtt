00:00:03.049 --> 00:00:08.610
 Take personal op right fine 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.510
 We are here again with LG pad for 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.030
 you 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.190
 There is a cool feature today asks 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.199
 that you can have afternoons on the 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.750
 lock without having to unlock it 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.730
 to access them pretty obvious that we 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.970
 there we will unlock the device here and 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:26.430
 we also have six shortcuts here in the 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.260
 bottom of the display and does not 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.359
 stay touching them you will not 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.189
 access to them you will not open this law 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.260
 really the applications you have to 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.360
 touch and drag right from the app 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.670
 which you will open for example directly in the 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.100
 chrome or what it was like on the screen 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.320
 direct lock on your camera which is 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.899
 very practical that no tablet is currently 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.870
 You already opened it directly on your camera then 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.879
 So you're going to take a picture that is 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.100
 interesting but honestly it is not 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.539
 very useful remembering that it is a tablet 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.590
 so I'm not going to use it so much to take 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.600
 Photos 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.640

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.220
 drag you to open directly to the 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:07.439
 function that is ok here but these 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.700
 shortcuts are not necessarily gallery 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.460
 chrome navigation 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:15.780
