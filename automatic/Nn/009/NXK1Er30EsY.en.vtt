quite<00:03:37.890> a<00:03:37.920> bit<00:03:38.130> bigger<00:03:38.180> than<00:03:39.180> this<00:03:39.330> d<00:03:39.540> Walt

00:03:42.839 --> 00:03:42.849 

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:45.339 

it's<00:03:43.849> got<00:03:44.000> to<00:03:44.060> be<00:03:44.120> almost<00:03:44.420> 2<00:03:44.780> inches<00:03:44.810> bigger

00:03:45.339 --> 00:03:45.349

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:47.510 
than the DeWalt so it's a little bit

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:49.420 
than the DeWalt so it's a little bit
