00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.060 
top of the rhizome still be exposed
that's<00:01:36.509> very<00:01:36.990> important<00:01:37.530> in<00:01:37.619> order<00:01:37.799> to<00:01:37.890> get

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
that's very important in order to get

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.649 
that's very important in order to get
lots<00:01:38.310> of<00:01:38.460> blooms<00:01:38.670> if<00:01:38.880> you<00:01:39.000> cover<00:01:39.360> the<00:01:39.630> whole

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
lots of blooms if you cover the whole

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.740 
lots of blooms if you cover the whole
rhizome<00:01:40.470> you'll<00:01:40.890> tend<00:01:41.280> to<00:01:41.430> get<00:01:41.610> fewer<00:01:42.570> and

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
rhizome you'll tend to get fewer and

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.170 
rhizome you'll tend to get fewer and
fewer<00:01:43.170> blooms<00:01:43.649> over<00:01:44.520> the<00:01:44.610> course<00:01:44.850> of<00:01:45.060> the

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
fewer blooms over the course of the

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.020 
fewer blooms over the course of the
years<00:01:45.500> okay<00:01:46.500> one<00:01:46.860> last<00:01:47.040> thing<00:01:47.369> that<00:01:47.399> I<00:01:47.549> like<00:01:47.850> to

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
years okay one last thing that I like to

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.569 
years okay one last thing that I like to
do<00:01:48.180> before<00:01:48.479> I<00:01:48.750> transplant<00:01:49.530> these<00:01:49.740> is<00:01:50.009> just

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
do before I transplant these is just

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.789 
do before I transplant these is just
give<00:01:50.790> them<00:01:50.970> a<00:01:51.060> little<00:01:51.210> bit<00:01:51.390> of<00:01:51.479> a<00:01:51.540> haircut<00:01:51.799> and

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
give them a little bit of a haircut and

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.920 
give them a little bit of a haircut and
just<00:01:52.979> cut<00:01:53.159> off<00:01:53.280> the<00:01:53.460> tops<00:01:53.729> so<00:01:54.030> that's<00:01:54.600> what

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
just cut off the tops so that's what

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.630 
just cut off the tops so that's what
I'll<00:01:55.049> replant<00:01:55.560> that's<00:01:55.829> the<00:01:56.040> final<00:01:56.369> product

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
I'll replant that's the final product

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.520 
I'll replant that's the final product
before<00:01:57.149> it<00:01:57.240> goes<00:01:57.360> back<00:01:57.659> into<00:01:57.930> the<00:01:58.049> ground<00:01:58.320> it

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
before it goes back into the ground it

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.170 
before it goes back into the ground it
just<00:01:58.740> lets<00:01:58.920> the<00:01:59.070> plant<00:01:59.310> develop<00:01:59.610> better<00:01:59.790> roots

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
just lets the plant develop better roots

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.410 
just lets the plant develop better roots
rather<00:02:00.780> than<00:02:01.049> a<00:02:01.200> lot<00:02:01.409> of<00:02:01.530> green<00:02:01.680> foliage<00:02:02.420> so

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
rather than a lot of green foliage so

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.060 
rather than a lot of green foliage so
that's<00:02:03.600> a<00:02:03.719> little<00:02:03.840> dwarf<00:02:04.200> virus<00:02:04.350> for<00:02:04.799> you<00:02:04.920> and

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
that's a little dwarf virus for you and

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.709 
that's a little dwarf virus for you and
a<00:02:05.100> little<00:02:05.310> lesson<00:02:05.520> on<00:02:05.700> transplanting<00:02:06.390> them<00:02:06.540> I

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
a little lesson on transplanting them I

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:07.999 
a little lesson on transplanting them I
