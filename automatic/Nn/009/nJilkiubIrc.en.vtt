00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
to map of the day today we're gonna be

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:18.710 
to map of the day today we're gonna be
checking<00:00:17.130> out<00:00:17.310> a<00:00:17.369> really<00:00:17.789> cool<00:00:17.940> map<00:00:18.330> this<00:00:18.539> is<00:00:18.690> a

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
checking out a really cool map this is a

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.900 
checking out a really cool map this is a
halo<00:00:19.140> survival<00:00:19.650> map<00:00:19.800> reminds<00:00:20.430> me<00:00:20.520> of<00:00:20.640> kind<00:00:20.789> of

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
halo survival map reminds me of kind of

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.910 
halo survival map reminds me of kind of
like<00:00:21.060> Skyblock<00:00:21.779> I<00:00:21.960> guess<00:00:22.170> it's<00:00:22.439> that<00:00:22.590> same

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
like Skyblock I guess it's that same

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.040 
like Skyblock I guess it's that same
idea<00:00:23.490> that<00:00:23.730> you<00:00:24.029> don't<00:00:24.240> want<00:00:24.420> to<00:00:24.480> fall<00:00:24.689> off<00:00:24.869> and

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
idea that you don't want to fall off and

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.570 
idea that you don't want to fall off and
you<00:00:25.109> kind<00:00:25.320> of<00:00:25.350> have<00:00:25.500> just<00:00:25.529> a<00:00:25.800> limited<00:00:26.070> amount

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
you kind of have just a limited amount

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.550 
you kind of have just a limited amount
of<00:00:26.640> space<00:00:26.820> to<00:00:27.240> build<00:00:27.420> things<00:00:27.779> is<00:00:28.230> he<00:00:28.349> gonna<00:00:28.470> be

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
of space to build things is he gonna be

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.140 
of space to build things is he gonna be
careful<00:00:28.980> with<00:00:29.070> your<00:00:29.189> resources<00:00:29.550> and<00:00:29.939> figure

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
careful with your resources and figure

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.330 
careful with your resources and figure
out<00:00:30.300> how<00:00:30.539> to<00:00:30.599> expand<00:00:31.199> and<00:00:31.500> keep<00:00:31.949> things<00:00:32.219> going

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
out how to expand and keep things going

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.670 
out how to expand and keep things going
on<00:00:32.820> this<00:00:33.000> island<00:00:33.270> so<00:00:33.630> one<00:00:34.290> thing<00:00:34.440> about<00:00:34.469> this

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
on this island so one thing about this

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.350 
on this island so one thing about this
one<00:00:34.860> is<00:00:34.980> you're<00:00:35.100> going<00:00:35.489> to<00:00:35.579> have<00:00:35.730> some<00:00:35.910> fairly

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
one is you're going to have some fairly

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.030 
one is you're going to have some fairly
limited<00:00:36.540> resources<00:00:37.320> so<00:00:37.469> you<00:00:37.590> don't<00:00:37.829> have<00:00:37.890> to

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
limited resources so you don't have to

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.040 
limited resources so you don't have to
really<00:00:38.610> take<00:00:38.850> a<00:00:38.910> lot<00:00:39.120> of<00:00:39.180> time<00:00:39.329> to<00:00:39.510> figure<00:00:39.719> out

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
really take a lot of time to figure out

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.660 
really take a lot of time to figure out
how<00:00:40.320> to<00:00:40.379> use<00:00:40.680> the<00:00:40.860> resources<00:00:41.219> that<00:00:41.460> are

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
how to use the resources that are

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.610 
how to use the resources that are
available<00:00:41.940> to<00:00:42.390> you<00:00:42.480> let's<00:00:43.050> make<00:00:43.230> it<00:00:43.290> better<00:00:43.469> so

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
available to you let's make it better so

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.069 
available to you let's make it better so
this<00:00:44.370> is<00:00:44.550> just<00:00:44.760> a<00:00:44.910> really<00:00:45.420> cool<00:00:45.600> map<00:00:45.809> it's<00:00:46.020> a

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
this is just a really cool map it's a

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.680 
this is just a really cool map it's a
really<00:00:46.410> nice<00:00:46.620> change<00:00:46.980> from<00:00:47.370> Skyblock<00:00:48.329> so

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
really nice change from Skyblock so

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.049 
really nice change from Skyblock so
that's<00:00:49.500> really<00:00:49.770> cool<00:00:50.010> obviously<00:00:50.520> other<00:00:50.730> goes

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
that's really cool obviously other goes

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.810 
that's really cool obviously other goes
Aikau<00:00:52.039> obviously<00:00:53.039> it<00:00:53.129> hasn't<00:00:53.309> to<00:00:53.460> do<00:00:53.640> with<00:00:53.730> the

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
Aikau obviously it hasn't to do with the

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.750 
Aikau obviously it hasn't to do with the
Halo<00:00:54.120> franchise<00:00:54.500> which<00:00:55.500> is<00:00:55.980> what<00:00:56.219> confused<00:00:56.610> me

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
Halo franchise which is what confused me

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.279 
Halo franchise which is what confused me
the<00:00:56.910> first<00:00:57.090> time<00:00:57.300> I<00:00:57.329> downloaded<00:00:57.840> it<00:00:58.050> I<00:00:58.140> thought

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
the first time I downloaded it I thought

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.950 
the first time I downloaded it I thought
it<00:00:58.410> was<00:00:58.500> like<00:00:58.590> a<00:00:58.649> halo<00:00:59.359> survival<00:01:00.359> map<00:01:00.539> you<00:01:00.840> know

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
it was like a halo survival map you know

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.740 
it was like a halo survival map you know
I<00:01:00.989> get<00:01:01.230> halo<00:01:01.410> franchise<00:01:01.829> survival<00:01:02.760> map<00:01:02.940> and

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
I get halo franchise survival map and

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.530 
I get halo franchise survival map and
it's<00:01:03.930> not<00:01:04.229> but<00:01:05.129> that's<00:01:05.369> alright<00:01:05.880> so<00:01:06.119> a<00:01:06.150> few

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
it's not but that's alright so a few

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.480 
it's not but that's alright so a few
things<00:01:06.570> to<00:01:06.810> kind<00:01:07.080> of<00:01:07.110> point<00:01:07.320> out<00:01:07.470> here<00:01:07.860> is<00:01:08.040> for

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
things to kind of point out here is for

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.789 
things to kind of point out here is for
stuff<00:01:09.090> if<00:01:09.630> you<00:01:09.780> have<00:01:09.810> a<00:01:09.960> creeper<00:01:10.439> on<00:01:10.500> here<00:01:10.740> I'm

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
stuff if you have a creeper on here I'm

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.050 
stuff if you have a creeper on here I'm
pretty<00:01:10.979> sure<00:01:11.250> you're<00:01:11.369> gonna<00:01:11.430> be<00:01:11.549> pretty

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060

pretty sure you're gonna be pretty
screwed<00:01:12.420> I<00:01:12.750> don't<00:01:13.110> know<00:01:13.170> if<00:01:13.229> we<00:01:13.290> look<00:01:13.439> at<00:01:13.530> all

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
screwed I don't know if we look at all

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.410 
screwed I don't know if we look at all
these<00:01:13.799> animals<00:01:14.430> on<00:01:14.670> the<00:01:14.820> side<00:01:15.000> here<00:01:15.180> I<00:01:15.210> think

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
these animals on the side here I think

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.179 
these animals on the side here I think
that's<00:01:15.570> just<00:01:15.659> really<00:01:15.930> cool<00:01:16.229> as<00:01:16.500> you<00:01:16.920> can<00:01:17.040> see

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
that's just really cool as you can see

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.600 
that's just really cool as you can see
the<00:01:17.310> trees<00:01:17.549> kind<00:01:17.759> of<00:01:17.909> go<00:01:18.090> up<00:01:18.330> like<00:01:18.960> so<00:01:19.610> one

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
the trees kind of go up like so one

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.219 
the trees kind of go up like so one
thing<00:01:20.880> about<00:01:21.090> this<00:01:21.270> map<00:01:21.479> is<00:01:21.720> I<00:01:21.840> think<00:01:21.900> it<00:01:22.140> would

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
thing about this map is I think it would

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:23.420 
thing about this map is I think it would
have<00:01:22.320> been<00:01:22.470> cool<00:01:22.650> if<00:01:22.770> it<00:01:22.830> was<00:01:22.920> a<00:01:23.009> little<00:01:23.340> bit

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
have been cool if it was a little bit

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.429 
have been cool if it was a little bit
thicker<00:01:23.880> to<00:01:24.479> where<00:01:24.630> there<00:01:24.810> could<00:01:24.930> be<00:01:25.080> just<00:01:25.290> a

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
thicker to where there could be just a

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.260 
thicker to where there could be just a
lot<00:01:25.680> of<00:01:25.740> really<00:01:26.220> cool<00:01:26.549> things<00:01:26.790> to<00:01:26.939> explore

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
lot of really cool things to explore

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.200 
lot of really cool things to explore
both<00:01:27.560> on<00:01:28.560> both<00:01:28.950> sides<00:01:29.430> and<00:01:29.759> now<00:01:30.060> obviously

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
both on both sides and now obviously

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.609 
both on both sides and now obviously
that's<00:01:30.630> a<00:01:30.780> little<00:01:30.960> bit<00:01:31.049> hard<00:01:31.259> she's<00:01:31.470> obviously

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
that's a little bit hard she's obviously

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.200 
that's a little bit hard she's obviously
gravity<00:01:32.369> it's<00:01:32.549> gonna<00:01:32.670> be<00:01:32.790> hard<00:01:33.030> getting

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
gravity it's gonna be hard getting

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.469 
gravity it's gonna be hard getting
through<00:01:33.450> all<00:01:33.600> this<00:01:33.780> as<00:01:33.990> it<00:01:34.470> is<00:01:35.240> so<00:01:36.240> I<00:01:36.299> don't

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
through all this as it is so I don't

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:37.880 
through all this as it is so I don't
know<00:01:36.540> just<00:01:36.990> kind<00:01:37.170> of<00:01:37.229> one<00:01:37.380> of<00:01:37.470> my<00:01:37.650> thoughts

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
know just kind of one of my thoughts

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.859 
know just kind of one of my thoughts
it's<00:01:38.100> definitely<00:01:38.700> a<00:01:38.729> good<00:01:38.970> idea<00:01:39.030> so<00:01:39.630> let<00:01:39.780> me

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
it's definitely a good idea so let me

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.620 
it's definitely a good idea so let me
show<00:01:40.020> you<00:01:40.049> this<00:01:40.320> dark<00:01:40.650> room<00:01:40.860> here<00:01:41.280> I<00:01:41.630> spawned

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
show you this dark room here I spawned

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 
for cons though I wish there was a

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:31.990 
for cons though I wish there was a
better<00:02:30.620> way<00:02:30.860> to<00:02:30.920> start<00:02:31.280> this<00:02:31.400> map<00:02:31.640> because<00:02:31.910> if

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
better way to start this map because if

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.190 
better way to start this map because if
you<00:02:32.090> look<00:02:32.270> at<00:02:32.390> this<00:02:32.480> there's<00:02:32.720> this<00:02:32.810> tunnel

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
you look at this there's this tunnel

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.020 
you look at this there's this tunnel
here<00:02:33.380> and<00:02:33.470> this<00:02:33.560> is<00:02:33.710> a<00:02:33.740> water<00:02:34.070> tunnel<00:02:34.490> and<00:02:34.730> from

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
here and this is a water tunnel and from

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:36.610 
here and this is a water tunnel and from
down<00:02:35.180> here<00:02:35.390> you<00:02:35.510> can<00:02:35.690> climb<00:02:35.900> up<00:02:35.960> so<00:02:36.260> it<00:02:36.380> kind<00:02:36.560> of

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
down here you can climb up so it kind of

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.920 
down here you can climb up so it kind of
really<00:02:37.310> allows<00:02:37.730> for<00:02:37.760> cheating<00:02:38.480> because<00:02:38.660> it

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
really allows for cheating because it

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:41.290 
really allows for cheating because it
works<00:02:39.140> both<00:02:39.530> ways<00:02:39.590> you<00:02:40.310> can<00:02:40.430> go<00:02:40.550> both<00:02:40.760> down<00:02:41.030> and

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:41.300 
works both ways you can go both down and

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:44.110 
works both ways you can go both down and
up<00:02:41.540> with<00:02:41.750> it<00:02:41.900> as<00:02:42.860> you<00:02:43.070> can<00:02:43.310> see<00:02:43.370> just<00:02:43.700> water<00:02:43.910> so

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
if you fall off and die you can easily

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:47.350 
if you fall off and die you can easily
go<00:02:45.800> and<00:02:45.980> retrieve<00:02:46.220> your<00:02:46.460> stuff<00:02:46.670> and<00:02:47.090> well<00:02:47.240> with

any adventure map all you have to do is

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.500 
any adventure map all you have to do is
throw<00:02:48.980> it<00:02:49.010> into<00:02:49.220> creators<00:02:49.940> to<00:02:50.090> cheat<00:02:50.300> it's

kind of threw me off I wish there was a

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:55.330 
kind of threw me off I wish there was a
better<00:02:54.290> way<00:02:54.350> to<00:02:54.440> start<00:02:54.710> it<00:02:54.830> where<00:02:55.040> everyone

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
better way to start it where everyone

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.160 
better way to start it where everyone
could<00:02:55.460> just<00:02:55.520> start<00:02:55.910> in<00:02:56.150> this<00:02:56.390> house<00:02:56.600> so<00:02:57.140> that

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.170 
could just start in this house so that

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:59.230 
could just start in this house so that
there's<00:02:57.410> never<00:02:57.530> need<00:02:57.830> to<00:02:57.950> go<00:02:58.070> down<00:02:58.220> there<00:02:58.400> so<00:02:59.000> I

00:02:59.230 --> 00:02:59.240
