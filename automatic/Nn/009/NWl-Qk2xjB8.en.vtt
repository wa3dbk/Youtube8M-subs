00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:05.730
 yes people have already come to my client is nl and I have a new video 

00:00:05.729 --> 00:00:10.380
 After a while ago there have been no new videos for a while because 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.529
 my current top has been scourged 

00:00:12.529 --> 00:00:17.670
 the hard disk is completely broken the set everything I had on the street 

00:00:17.669 --> 00:00:19.509
 standing is gone 

00:00:19.509 --> 00:00:24.649
 and on including the movies including the intro whose term is movies 

00:00:24.649 --> 00:00:26.499
 everything everything everything away 

00:00:26.499 --> 00:00:30.729
 of ages and only then is there almost no interest in my lap 

00:00:30.729 --> 00:00:35.070
 the year that is why I have not been able to put anything on youtube and 

00:00:35.069 --> 00:00:38.030
 after he got a new laptop 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:41.840
 and i'm also going to make a new intro and you would like to make but i thought i'm going 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.840
 anyway and post the video next week 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:46.870
 everything is also a bit like his family 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:51.730
 and I assume Swedish to show though I had little luck with him 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:56.870
 the zip code last month disappeared there just known to us from the 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:01.080
 yes they just did not arrive and one of the two teams of the very strange because 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:04.330
 that were different park is even from different countries 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:07.490
 but also from the online stores 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.610
 and they just didn't get to it and it seems strong to me that all those packages 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.740
 were lost on its own so we quickly dropped 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:19.820
 as a result of which they and, in particular, research have stood as a postman and as good 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:22.870
 is that it is settled now because we are getting the park right now 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:24.470
 just inside 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:29.350
 well i would start myself i have a couple by then the other one 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:32.570
 must use a zip code or to which they have a postal address 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:37.290
 and at that address all the party that came in from us were opened 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.510
 so i have some kids who are ok but yes 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:44.580
 that makes it no less fun where I start with a package 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:49.210
 an acquaintance and this a weekend of harn consoles so further I have often 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:50.240
 communicated 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.680
 and this time we have money for these two injections 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:54.490
 and 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:02:00.700
 the core mt further takes from the came also luis set for me i am 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.800
 I try not to complete it as quickly as possible 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:07.760
 I still have a few people but there are many cards that still come in 

00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:13.289
 and I still have a big package for you and a small one for the party 

00:02:13.919 --> 00:02:18.090
 and I think I am going with small package then I will continue I will enjoy it 

00:02:18.669 --> 00:02:21.669
 really the case always 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:23.829
 and 

00:02:23.829 --> 00:02:26.459
 and very cool this comes from deutsche bank 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:29.860
 and this is what we have for money and has also been a text while 

00:02:29.859 --> 00:02:30.659
 done 

00:02:30.659 --> 00:02:33.750
 I do not agree with him that we are renewing today 

00:02:34.289 --> 00:02:37.049
 but the generation first bianci 

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:39.489
 and he had the previous one on it 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:42.330
 put the two pages on facebook 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:44.259
 and I still have legs 

00:02:44.259 --> 00:02:48.729
 just have novum in yemen and so it is also an idiocy 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:53.159
 that's how wendy jans shows her raising her hand 

00:02:55.029 --> 00:02:57.299
 a very very beautiful one 

00:02:57.299 --> 00:02:59.929
 girls already sick in it 

00:02:59.929 --> 00:03:03.789
 I am really happy with that because it is finished in the whole 

00:03:03.789 --> 00:03:04.889
 when you see 

00:03:04.889 --> 00:03:09.339
 I really like it very much off your back is a great gold 

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:16.629
 who sees this as a silver plated in the room lurks me 

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:21.219
 where I find it really a very beautiful path but especially the one the evolution first 

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:25.569
 and he also added this as an extra 

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:31.069
 I have not realized that the media or radiance researchers can do that themselves 

00:03:32.289 --> 00:03:35.829
 hopefully there will be more bianchi tickets because I think it's really one 

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:38.029
 very cool pokmon 

00:03:38.029 --> 00:03:42.239
 well and further i had violence and manager niels s viktor elm 

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:46.859
 and there was actually 15 euros with which you made the internet 

00:03:47.399 --> 00:03:50.199
 and 

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:54.379
 I honestly don't know what I think of him, he got a horse first 

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:56.519
 provided that one is sent and even 

00:03:56.519 --> 00:03:59.580
 and these are third cards that has 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:00.799
 the way to bed 

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:03.729
 side those experienced devices 

00:04:03.729 --> 00:04:07.039
 and I have that I have a very worthy Japanese 

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:10.819
 Then who came into action when he smelled the street 

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:15.709
 and strong 61 

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:17.669
 hence 59 

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:18.769
 the set list 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:20.569
 I have as much smaller 

00:04:20.569 --> 00:04:24.849
 And he also has a number of other Paul Matthew's bad luck on the channel extras 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:28.110
 and the tour that la 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:30.650
 beautiful son 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:32.569
 svi young 

00:04:32.569 --> 00:04:34.379
 I leave it on 

00:04:34.379 --> 00:04:36.050
 four bands 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:37.900
 deliver it 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:39.759
 no more and 

00:04:39.759 --> 00:04:43.180
 do not buy out a few hours 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:45.090
 and the 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:48.090
 that became 76 national symbols 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:51.979
 tested six times 

00:04:51.979 --> 00:04:53.689
 wholly in your hands 

00:04:53.689 --> 00:04:56.689
 this is very diverse that syria itself too 

00:04:57.499 --> 00:05:00.829
 Gordon and angry know and one by bus both 

00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:06.320
 well thanks everyone for the party i am very happy and with the things 

00:05:06.319 --> 00:05:09.979
 I received that, I am very happy that they have arrived 

00:05:09.979 --> 00:05:13.039
 m the disruption again for their interests 

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:18.530
 Japan would actually go back because its policy that was broken but there 

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:20.430
 released a new video clip 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:22.379
 new chinese open service 

00:05:22.379 --> 00:05:24.050
 and hopefully 

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:27.940
 all the paperwork very large opening position I intend to 

00:05:28.529 --> 00:05:31.920
 yes it is those boxes to pick up the 

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:35.580
 and what is there I also know sister of a few gigs 

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:38.819
 but they will come later this month 

00:05:38.819 --> 00:05:44.020
 and the horse dian cybook itself which I also have to deal with these two 

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:47.449
 We look to see if we can get India done here 

00:05:48.419 --> 00:05:51.350
 Lots of question marks always left behind lately 

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:53.090
 and until next time 3
