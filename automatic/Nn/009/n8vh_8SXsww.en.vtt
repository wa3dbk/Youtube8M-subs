00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.730
 the uselessness of suffering 

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:16.710
 effectively for a long time we 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.600
 We have dedicated ourselves to see how we stop 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.150
 suffer uselessly and after having 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.789
 treated thousands and thousands of people today 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.519

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.289
 that will help us to be happy and that's what 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.670
 that we want to show you we want

 see what the human eye does not perceive and you 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:38.760
 lets hear what the words we 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.230
 they say lets you also distinguish what 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.180
 what is the truth and what is the lie 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.180
 what is the authenticity and what is the 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.670
 cheating because today we are going to see how we can 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.890
 learn to forgive forgive 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.810
 would be the first essential key of 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.700
 our life we are born knowing 

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:56.490
 forgive us but nonetheless throughout 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:58.230
 of our lives many people stop 

00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:00.450
 do it and stop it from happening a 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.250
 little in their insecurities and in their 

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:04.590
 fears I have to when we do not 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.250
 we forgive we lower our self-esteem and 

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:07.380
 our 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.020
 is in the hands of others that is something 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.380
 that we can not afford donuts 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.450
 it is the fundamental axis 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:18.270
 love us better to be the key that we 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.490
 will help to give the impulse and control and 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.680
 take the reins of our lives what 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.290
 will definitely allow us to give that 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.720
 important step that is the step towards 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.000
 happiness let's see how we do it 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.220
 in very complicated situations when 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.510
 we have really failed we think that 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.400
 we have failed the person who most 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:36.930
 has wanted in life when we knew to 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.880
 our family of our children to 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.340
 our friends when we have to 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.869
 we have gone from ready when a 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.790
 moment that we are very weak that we 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.530
 we feel very sick when they are 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.940
 we who do not want to forgive us 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.570
 when these are they want us 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:51.149
 handle 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:53.280
 let's see how to get it and there 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:55.680
 we will find in a very clear way 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.020
 how to do it I think there is no 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.509
 person who finds your example 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.759
 reflected in this book I believe that you are the 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:05.880
 great contribution that we can give them and what 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:07.830
 What I would ask them to do is follow it 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:11.220
 will then constitute a 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:13.320
 and then in his life forgiveness will make us 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:16.830
 freer but after winning us 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:20.630
 themselves will make us happier and we will not 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:20.630
 will drop into the hands of others
