the power we get back more water you see
the<00:02:45.930> current<00:02:46.140> steps<00:02:46.500> obviously<00:02:47.040> we've<00:02:47.160> just

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
the current steps obviously we've just

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.340 
the current steps obviously we've just
our<00:02:47.400> boxes<00:02:47.760> unboxed<00:02:48.330> it<00:02:48.420> so<00:02:48.600> so<00:02:49.080> there's<00:02:49.260> no
