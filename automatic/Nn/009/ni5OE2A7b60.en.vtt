00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
here most of your chrome is covered the

here most of your chrome is covered the

sides are covered the top and bottom are
fully<00:02:29.040> exposed<00:02:29.489> so<00:02:29.790> that's<00:02:30.540> kind<00:02:30.780> of<00:02:30.840> a

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:30.989 
fully exposed so that's kind of a

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:34.880 
fully exposed so that's kind of a
downside<00:02:31.620> if<00:02:31.920> you<00:02:32.160> don't<00:02:32.940> like<00:02:33.150> your<00:02:33.890> your

screen protector kind of just looks like
it<00:02:38.970> just<00:02:39.000> goes<00:02:39.450> right<00:02:39.720> over<00:02:39.780> except<00:02:40.650> for<00:02:40.680> the

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
design you do have a little bit because

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.070 
design you do have a little bit because
it<00:02:57.390> is<00:02:57.510> a<00:02:57.540> bit<00:02:57.810> raised<00:02:58.730> but<00:02:59.730> not<00:02:59.910> as<00:03:00.090> much<00:03:00.360> up

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080

mirror screen protector there is that

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:27.920 
mirror screen protector there is that
little<00:03:26.579> cutout<00:03:26.970> here<00:03:27.150> so<00:03:27.390> your<00:03:27.570> sensors

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
little cutout here so your sensors

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:30.110 
little cutout here so your sensors
aren't<00:03:28.170> blocked<00:03:28.530> and<00:03:29.310> you<00:03:29.400> have<00:03:29.640> a<00:03:29.670> nice<00:03:29.880> cut

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
aren't blocked and you have a nice cut

aren't blocked and you have a nice cut
out<00:03:30.239> it<00:03:30.480> does<00:03:30.630> look<00:03:30.810> like<00:03:30.890> does<00:03:31.890> look<00:03:32.070> really

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
out it does look like does look really

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:34.849 
out it does look like does look really
nice<00:03:32.670> the<00:03:33.239> only<00:03:33.390> downside<00:03:33.630> I<00:03:33.959> think<00:03:34.320> to<00:03:34.560> mirror

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:34.859 
nice the only downside I think to mirror

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:38.240 
nice the only downside I think to mirror
screen<00:03:35.100> protectors<00:03:35.609> that<00:03:35.640> right<00:03:36.120> now<00:03:36.709> in<00:03:37.709> the

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
screen protectors that right now in the

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.870 
screen protectors that right now in the
summer<00:03:38.489> are<00:03:38.820> that<00:03:39.150> it<00:03:39.480> is<00:03:39.660> hard<00:03:39.900> to<00:03:40.019> read

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:40.880 
summer are that it is hard to read

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:45.170 
summer are that it is hard to read
anything<00:03:41.880> on<00:03:42.290> a<00:03:43.290> mirror<00:03:44.250> screen<00:03:44.489> protector<00:03:44.549> in

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
anything on a mirror screen protector in

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.090 
anything on a mirror screen protector in
the<00:03:45.420> Sun<00:03:45.630> it's<00:03:46.260> kind<00:03:46.500> of<00:03:46.560> like<00:03:46.709> you're<00:03:46.950> looking

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:47.100 
the Sun it's kind of like you're looking

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:48.470 
the Sun it's kind of like you're looking
into<00:03:47.340> something<00:03:47.880> and<00:03:48.030> you're<00:03:48.120> just<00:03:48.269> like

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
into something and you're just like

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:52.759 
into something and you're just like
blinded<00:03:49.320> like<00:03:49.500> look<00:03:50.420> like<00:03:51.420> they're<00:03:51.769> blinding

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:52.769 
blinded like look like they're blinding

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:58.449 
blinded like look like they're blinding
like<00:03:54.260> also<00:03:55.260> you<00:03:55.859> do<00:03:56.010> have<00:03:56.190> to<00:03:56.370> have<00:03:56.400> your<00:03:57.290> your

00:03:58.449 --> 00:03:58.459 
like also you do have to have your your

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:01.490 
like also you do have to have your your
brightness<00:03:59.459> all<00:03:59.730> the<00:03:59.880> way<00:03:59.970> up<00:04:00.120> with<00:04:00.329> this<00:04:00.500> well

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
brightness all the way up with this well

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.500 
brightness all the way up with this well
that's<00:04:01.920> what<00:04:02.100> I<00:04:02.130> found<00:04:02.370> at<00:04:02.549> least<00:04:02.700> you<00:04:03.390> can

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.510 
that's what I found at least you can

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:05.509 
that's what I found at least you can
still<00:04:03.660> use<00:04:03.930> it<00:04:03.959> with<00:04:04.590> the<00:04:04.680> brightness<00:04:04.920> low<00:04:05.250> but

00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:05.519 
still use it with the brightness low but

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:08.120 
still use it with the brightness low but
it<00:04:06.209> does<00:04:06.420> make<00:04:06.600> the<00:04:06.780> screen<00:04:07.140> a<00:04:07.380> lot<00:04:07.680> darker

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:08.130 
it does make the screen a lot darker

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:10.819 
it does make the screen a lot darker
than<00:04:08.549> it<00:04:08.880> normally<00:04:09.180> is<00:04:09.480> usually<00:04:10.410> with<00:04:10.560> normal

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:10.829 
than it normally is usually with normal

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:12.319 
than it normally is usually with normal
screen<00:04:11.010> protectors<00:04:11.459> or<00:04:11.549> no<00:04:11.700> screen<00:04:11.940> protector

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:12.329 
screen protectors or no screen protector

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:14.949 
screen protectors or no screen protector
I<00:04:12.389> have<00:04:12.630> it<00:04:12.780> down<00:04:12.959> there<00:04:13.489> that's<00:04:14.489> how<00:04:14.670> low<00:04:14.850> my

00:04:14.949 --> 00:04:14.959 
I have it down there that's how low my

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:19.460 
I have it down there that's how low my
brightness<00:04:15.959> is<00:04:16.639> but<00:04:17.639> with<00:04:17.789> this<00:04:17.910> I<00:04:18.260> found<00:04:19.260> I

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:22.140 
needed to have it all the way up so that

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:24.230 
needed to have it all the way up so that
it's<00:04:22.289> easier<00:04:22.590> to<00:04:22.740> use<00:04:22.970> easier<00:04:23.970> to<00:04:24.090> see

everything and everything

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:27.240 
everything and everything
a lot<00:04:25.330> clearer<00:04:25.620> but<00:04:26.620> if<00:04:26.770> you're<00:04:26.919> one<00:04:27.070> of<00:04:27.160> those

a lot clearer but if you're one of those

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:28.620 
a lot clearer but if you're one of those

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:38.850

smudge<00:04:36.699> fairly<00:04:37.630> easily<00:04:37.810> so<00:04:38.289> it's<00:04:38.530> kind<00:04:38.740> of

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:38.860 
smudge fairly easily so it's kind of

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:44.010 
smudge fairly easily so it's kind of
like<00:04:39.419> a<00:04:41.970> fingerprint<00:04:42.970> magnet<00:04:43.210> if<00:04:43.570> you<00:04:43.840> have

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:44.020

I<00:04:49.539> found<00:04:49.900> that<00:04:50.110> this<00:04:50.560> does<00:04:50.860> lift<00:04:51.130> up<00:04:51.310> because

00:04:51.629 --> 00:04:51.639 
I found that this does lift up because

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:54.629 
I found that this does lift up because
it<00:04:51.759> is<00:04:51.910> thicker<00:04:52.180> so<00:04:53.020> it<00:04:53.289> does<00:04:53.500> sort<00:04:54.070> of<00:04:54.190> lift<00:04:54.460> up

00:04:54.629 --> 00:04:54.639 
it is thicker so it does sort of lift up

00:04:54.639 --> 00:04:57.480 
it is thicker so it does sort of lift up
with<00:04:55.270> slider<00:04:55.780> cases<00:04:56.350> that<00:04:56.560> push<00:04:56.949> up<00:04:57.130> against

00:06:03.089 --> 00:06:03.099 
this case is I found it's kind of hard

00:06:03.099 --> 00:06:05.939 
this case is I found it's kind of hard
to<00:06:03.190> get<00:06:03.580> it<00:06:03.729> off<00:06:04.000> you<00:06:04.960> kind<00:06:05.169> of<00:06:05.229> have<00:06:05.380> to<00:06:05.409> dig

00:06:05.939 --> 00:06:05.949 
to get it off you kind of have to dig

00:06:05.949 --> 00:06:11.909 
to get it off you kind of have to dig
down<00:06:06.310> here<00:06:06.789> and<00:06:07.260> sort<00:06:08.260> of<00:06:08.440> I<00:06:10.740> still<00:06:11.740> haven't

00:06:11.909 --> 00:06:11.919 
down here and sort of I still haven't

00:06:11.919 --> 00:06:16.610 
down here and sort of I still haven't
figured<00:06:12.130> this<00:06:12.310> out<00:06:12.690> you<00:06:13.690> gotta<00:06:13.870> lift<00:06:14.260> it<00:06:14.440> up

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:16.620 

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:18.959 

there<00:06:17.620> you<00:06:17.710> go

00:06:18.959 --> 00:06:18.969 
there you go

00:06:18.969 --> 00:06:22.259 
there you go
and<00:06:19.779> pull<00:06:20.679> out<00:06:20.799> so<00:06:21.429> it's<00:06:21.549> kind<00:06:21.729> of<00:06:21.789> hard<00:06:21.969> to<00:06:22.029> get

00:06:22.259 --> 00:06:22.269 
and pull out so it's kind of hard to get
