the barnes and noble leather-bound
classic<00:02:21.260> editions<00:02:21.709> i<00:02:21.860> think<00:02:22.010> that's<00:02:22.129> what

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
classic editions i think that's what

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:24.309 
classic editions i think that's what
they're<00:02:22.400> called<00:02:22.640> and<00:02:23.090> it's<00:02:23.629> just<00:02:23.930> really

00:02:24.309 --> 00:02:24.319 
they're called and it's just really

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:27.640 
they're called and it's just really
pretty<00:02:25.220> i<00:02:25.580> love<00:02:25.640> these<00:02:26.330> kind<00:02:26.599> of<00:02:26.690> swirly<00:02:27.379> end

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
pretty i love these kind of swirly end

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.850 
pretty i love these kind of swirly end
pages<00:02:28.340> and<00:02:28.700> i<00:02:28.940> think<00:02:29.480> that<00:02:29.660> the<00:02:29.810> purple<00:02:30.260> pages

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
pages and i think that the purple pages

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:32.920 
pages and i think that the purple pages
are<00:02:31.160> awesome<00:02:31.760> like<00:02:32.090> they're<00:02:32.239> kind<00:02:32.360> of<00:02:32.450> subtly

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 
are awesome like they're kind of subtly

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:36.670 
are awesome like they're kind of subtly
purple<00:02:33.410> but<00:02:33.800> it's<00:02:34.459> just<00:02:34.940> really<00:02:35.780> really<00:02:36.349> well

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
purple but it's just really really well

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.280 
purple but it's just really really well
done<00:02:36.709> I<00:02:37.190> think<00:02:37.489> all<00:02:37.670> the<00:02:37.880> covers<00:02:38.239> of<00:02:38.420> this

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
done I think all the covers of this

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:42.009 
done I think all the covers of this
collection<00:02:39.709> are<00:02:40.280> really<00:02:40.670> beautiful<00:02:40.819> and<00:02:41.510> this

00:02:42.009 --> 00:02:42.019 
collection are really beautiful and this

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:43.390

is<00:02:42.200> a<00:02:42.230> purple<00:02:42.620> one<00:02:42.650> that<00:02:42.920> I<00:02:42.950> think<00:02:43.010> is<00:02:43.340> really

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
is a purple one that I think is really

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.339 
is a purple one that I think is really
wonderful<00:02:43.880> also<00:02:44.569> can<00:02:44.750> we<00:02:44.840> just<00:02:45.019> say<00:02:45.170> how

00:02:45.339 --> 00:02:45.349 
wonderful also can we just say how

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:47.410 
wonderful also can we just say how
beautiful<00:02:45.769> the<00:02:45.890> spine<00:02:46.190> is<00:02:46.430> because<00:02:46.940> seriously

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
beautiful the spine is because seriously

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:49.630 
beautiful the spine is because seriously
like<00:02:47.870> if<00:02:48.260> I<00:02:48.380> had<00:02:48.500> a<00:02:48.530> bunch<00:02:48.769> of<00:02:48.920> these<00:02:49.099> altima

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
like if I had a bunch of these altima

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.509 
like if I had a bunch of these altima
that<00:02:49.849> would<00:02:49.970> be<00:02:50.120> so<00:02:50.750> so<00:02:51.560> pretty<00:02:51.799> next<00:02:52.250> up<00:02:52.400> we

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:52.519 
that would be so so pretty next up we

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:54.130 
that would be so so pretty next up we
have<00:02:52.549> a<00:02:52.670> book<00:02:52.849> that<00:02:52.880> is<00:02:53.150> probably<00:02:53.540> a<00:02:53.660> solid

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140 
have a book that is probably a solid

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.740 
have a book that is probably a solid
combination<00:02:54.769> of<00:02:54.980> blue<00:02:55.310> and<00:02:55.700> purple<00:02:56.269> but<00:02:56.720> I

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
combination of blue and purple but I

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:58.420 
combination of blue and purple but I
wanted<00:02:57.049> to<00:02:57.110> include<00:02:57.380> it<00:02:57.530> here<00:02:57.590> because<00:02:58.040> I<00:02:58.310> have

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
wanted to include it here because I have

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:00.039 
wanted to include it here because I have
a<00:02:58.459> ton<00:02:58.730> of<00:02:58.760> blue<00:02:59.030> books<00:02:59.209> on<00:02:59.360> my<00:02:59.480> shelf<00:02:59.510> but<00:02:59.870> not

00:03:00.039 --> 00:03:00.049 
a ton of blue books on my shelf but not

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:02.199 
a ton of blue books on my shelf but not
a<00:03:00.079> ton<00:03:00.290> of<00:03:00.349> purple<00:03:00.769> ones<00:03:00.980> and<00:03:01.370> that<00:03:01.519> is<00:03:01.849> range

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:02.209 
a ton of purple ones and that is range

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:04.240 
a ton of purple ones and that is range
of<00:03:02.390> ghosts<00:03:02.750> by<00:03:02.870> elizabeth<00:03:03.319> bear<00:03:03.349> and<00:03:03.860> i<00:03:03.980> think

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
of ghosts by elizabeth bear and i think

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:05.770 
of ghosts by elizabeth bear and i think
if<00:03:04.730> you<00:03:04.880> find<00:03:05.120> her<00:03:05.209> i<00:03:05.239> can<00:03:05.420> see<00:03:05.540> that<00:03:05.569> it

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
if you find her i can see that it

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:07.360 
if you find her i can see that it
definitely<00:03:05.900> comes<00:03:06.260> across<00:03:06.560> more<00:03:06.890> purple<00:03:07.340> than

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
definitely comes across more purple than

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:09.940 
definitely comes across more purple than
blue<00:03:07.790> so<00:03:08.120> i<00:03:08.299> feel<00:03:08.720> justified<00:03:09.319> putting<00:03:09.650> this<00:03:09.739> in

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950 
blue so i feel justified putting this in

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:12.460 
blue so i feel justified putting this in
here<00:03:10.280> but<00:03:10.579> this<00:03:11.180> book<00:03:11.510> i<00:03:11.720> just<00:03:12.079> want<00:03:12.260> to<00:03:12.349> say

00:03:42.009 --> 00:03:42.019 
my opinion I mean everything else is

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:44.140 
my opinion I mean everything else is
pretty<00:03:42.230> much<00:03:42.350> like<00:03:42.769> good<00:03:43.010> it's<00:03:43.190> solid<00:03:43.430> simple

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.150 
pretty much like good it's solid simple

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:46.660 
pretty much like good it's solid simple
the<00:03:44.359> writing<00:03:44.720> is<00:03:44.840> very<00:03:44.900> simple<00:03:45.440> the<00:03:46.069> spine<00:03:46.430> is

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:46.670 
the writing is very simple the spine is

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:48.250 
the writing is very simple the spine is
very<00:03:46.730> simple<00:03:47.269> with<00:03:47.540> just<00:03:47.569> a<00:03:47.810> little<00:03:48.019> bit<00:03:48.170> of

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:48.260 
very simple with just a little bit of

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.319 
very simple with just a little bit of
illustration<00:03:49.010> and<00:03:49.190> the<00:03:49.340> back<00:03:49.519> is<00:03:49.730> also<00:03:50.060> super

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:50.329 
illustration and the back is also super

00:03:50.329 --> 00:03:52.660 
illustration and the back is also super
simple<00:03:50.870> but<00:03:51.200> i<00:03:51.380> think<00:03:51.859> that<00:03:51.950> the<00:03:52.040> illustration

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:52.670 
simple but i think that the illustration

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:55.900 
simple but i think that the illustration
on<00:03:52.790> the<00:03:52.910> cover<00:03:53.120> is<00:03:53.359> so<00:03:54.099> stunning<00:03:55.099> and<00:03:55.670> it's

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:57.640 
on the cover is so stunning and it's
probably<00:03:56.389> one<00:03:56.630> of<00:03:56.660> my<00:03:56.780> favorite<00:03:57.380> cover

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:57.650 
probably one of my favorite cover

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:00.280 
probably one of my favorite cover
illustrations<00:03:58.489> that<00:03:58.639> i've<00:03:58.790> seen<00:03:58.959> so<00:03:59.959> far<00:04:00.230> I

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:00.290 
illustrations that i've seen so far I

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:01.809 
illustrations that i've seen so far I
think<00:04:00.410> the<00:04:00.650> rest<00:04:00.829> of<00:04:00.980> the<00:04:01.040> series<00:04:01.250> is<00:04:01.489> also

00:04:01.809 --> 00:04:01.819 
think the rest of the series is also

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:03.970

also<00:04:45.710> really<00:04:46.070> pretty<00:04:46.460> but<00:04:46.670> I<00:04:46.730> think<00:04:47.000> that<00:04:47.150> this

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:47.300 
also really pretty but I think that this

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:49.810

one<00:04:47.570> is<00:04:47.780> my<00:04:48.350> favorite<00:04:48.830> any<00:04:49.040> second<00:04:49.580> book<00:04:49.700> in

one is my favorite any second book in
the<00:04:49.880> duology<00:04:50.780> I<00:04:50.930> think<00:04:51.230> shadow<00:04:51.530> scale<00:04:51.920> is<00:04:52.220> also

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:53.120 
the duology I think shadow scale is also

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:54.760

beautiful<00:04:53.300> as<00:04:53.630> a<00:04:53.780> gorgeous<00:04:54.170> cover<00:04:54.350> as<00:04:54.560> well<00:04:54.710> I

beautiful as a gorgeous cover as well I

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:56.800

think<00:04:55.010> that<00:04:55.130> one's<00:04:55.280> blue<00:04:55.580> and<00:04:56.060> I<00:04:56.270> think<00:04:56.720> if<00:04:56.780> I

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:56.810 
think that one's blue and I think if I

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:58.090 
think that one's blue and I think if I
had<00:04:56.840> to<00:04:57.020> pick<00:04:57.050> my<00:04:57.290> favorite<00:04:57.650> purple<00:04:57.860> book

had to pick my favorite purple book
cover<00:04:58.370> this<00:04:58.700> would<00:04:58.970> definitely<00:04:59.360> be<00:05:00.050> it<00:05:00.290> so
