what stand turf a burger to which
company<00:00:05.330> okay

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:07.860 
company okay

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:13.100 
company okay
and<00:00:08.189> this<00:00:08.580> is<00:00:08.790> a<00:00:08.820> work<00:00:11.090> work<00:00:12.090> spiral<00:00:12.629> pump<00:00:12.870> and

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
and this is a work work spiral pump and

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:14.289 
and this is a work work spiral pump and
they<00:00:13.200> built<00:00:13.440> it<00:00:13.620> for<00:00:13.799> the<00:00:13.860> Sandcastle

00:00:14.289 --> 00:00:14.299 
they built it for the Sandcastle

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:19.790 
they built it for the Sandcastle
competition<00:00:15.299> in<00:00:15.420> Galveston<00:00:16.970> TSC<00:00:17.970> and<00:00:18.800> I'm

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
competition in Galveston TSC and I'm

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.440 
competition in Galveston TSC and I'm
walking<00:00:20.130> around<00:00:20.369> and<00:00:20.759> now<00:00:20.970> what<00:00:21.270> they're

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:21.450 
walking around and now what they're

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:23.600 
walking around and now what they're
doing<00:00:21.480> they<00:00:21.869> did<00:00:22.410> not<00:00:22.529> have<00:00:22.860> can't<00:00:23.400> use

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:23.610 
doing they did not have can't use

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:25.990 
doing they did not have can't use
gasoline<00:00:23.910> power<00:00:24.480> down<00:00:24.840> here<00:00:25.080> anymore

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:26.000 
gasoline power down here anymore

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.330 
gasoline power down here anymore
so<00:00:27.000> they<00:00:27.240> devised<00:00:27.900> the<00:00:28.230> method<00:00:28.619> to<00:00:28.710> pump<00:00:28.980> water

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
so they devised the method to pump water

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.250 
so they devised the method to pump water
up<00:00:29.760> to<00:00:29.789> the<00:00:30.119> sand<00:00:31.050> castle<00:00:31.380> competition<00:00:31.830> build

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:33.260

ow

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:56.130 

gravity<00:00:49.600> takes<00:00:50.020> over<00:00:53.340> pressure<00:00:54.810> actually<00:00:55.810> a

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:56.140 
gravity takes over pressure actually a

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:58.110 
gravity takes over pressure actually a
band<00:00:56.500> right<00:00:56.680> here<00:00:56.740> she<00:00:57.130> don't<00:00:57.250> have<00:00:57.370> to<00:00:57.580> learn

00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:58.120 
band right here she don't have to learn

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:03.180 
band right here she don't have to learn
about<00:00:58.330> work<00:01:01.170> how<00:01:02.170> much<00:01:02.320> pressure<00:01:02.650> you<00:01:02.920> think

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:03.190 
about work how much pressure you think

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:05.200 
about work how much pressure you think
you<00:01:03.309> have<00:01:03.489> to<00:01:03.640> put<00:01:03.820> on<00:01:03.880> that<00:01:04.030> thing

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:05.210 
you have to put on that thing

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:09.820 
you have to put on that thing
20<00:01:05.900> pounds<00:01:06.490> that<00:01:07.490> Mary

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:09.830 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:12.740 

I

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.179 

perfect<00:01:13.750> day<00:01:13.899> down<00:01:14.170> here<00:01:14.200> in<00:01:14.469> Galveston<00:01:14.829> see

00:01:15.179 --> 00:01:15.189 
perfect day down here in Galveston see

00:01:15.189 --> 00:01:16.620 
perfect day down here in Galveston see
I'm<00:01:15.340> putting<00:01:15.670> pressure<00:01:15.700> on<00:01:16.149> it<00:01:16.210> it's<00:01:16.509> just

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:16.630 
I'm putting pressure on it it's just

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:20.999 
I'm putting pressure on it it's just
it's<00:01:17.020> easy<00:01:17.229> to<00:01:17.530> turn<00:01:18.509> yeah<00:01:19.530> and<00:01:20.530> so<00:01:20.710> you<00:01:20.860> were

00:01:20.999 --> 00:01:21.009 
it's easy to turn yeah and so you were

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:23.700 
it's easy to turn yeah and so you were
describing<00:01:21.490> how<00:01:21.789> it<00:01:21.960> fills<00:01:22.960> the<00:01:23.110> tube<00:01:23.500> up

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:23.710 
describing how it fills the tube up

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:26.039 
describing how it fills the tube up
about<00:01:24.009> halfway<00:01:24.310> and<00:01:24.640> then<00:01:24.969> as<00:01:25.360> it<00:01:25.539> gets<00:01:25.719> near

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:26.049 
about halfway and then as it gets near

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:44.160 
about halfway and then as it gets near
the<00:01:26.229> end<00:01:40.829> it<00:01:41.829> is<00:01:42.069> a<00:01:42.100> unique<00:01:42.640> a<00:01:42.850> unique<00:01:43.140> way<00:01:44.140> to

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:44.170 
the end it is a unique a unique way to

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:46.770 
the end it is a unique a unique way to
pump<00:01:44.740> water<00:01:45.039> the<00:01:45.610> pumping<00:01:46.030> water<00:01:46.240> how<00:01:46.360> far<00:01:46.630> do

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:46.780 
pump water the pumping water how far do

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:58.789 
pump water the pumping water how far do
the<00:01:47.229> puff<00:01:47.560> of<00:01:47.740> water<00:01:47.920> up<00:01:48.130> there

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.169 

so<00:01:59.799> we<00:01:59.920> had<00:02:00.100> somebody<00:02:00.520> up<00:02:00.700> here<00:02:00.909> with<00:02:01.060> the

00:02:01.169 --> 00:02:01.179 
so we had somebody up here with the

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:05.160 
so we had somebody up here with the
umbrella<00:02:03.420> pumping<00:02:04.420> water<00:02:04.630> while<00:02:04.869> they<00:02:04.990> do

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.170 
umbrella pumping water while they do

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:06.899 
umbrella pumping water while they do
competition<00:02:05.920> what<00:02:06.070> y'all<00:02:06.280> start<00:02:06.549> building

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:06.909 
competition what y'all start building

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:10.450 
competition what y'all start building
this<00:02:07.000> morning<00:02:07.179> about<00:02:07.600> 8:00
