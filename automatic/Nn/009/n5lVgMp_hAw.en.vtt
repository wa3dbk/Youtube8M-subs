00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:05.690
 for the preparation of cochinita 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:05.690
 pibil we need 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:13.160
 kilo and a half of fat-free pork 

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:15.530
 90 grams of achiote paste half cup 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:19.029
 of lemon juice and a cup of juice 

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:19.029
 orange to dissolve achiote 

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:27.450
 let's start with the cochinita pibil 

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:29.240
 let's cut the meat are the 

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:32.720
 more traditional dishes of the kitchen 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.720
 from the southeast 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:36.280
 let's cut into dice 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:39.910
 approximately five centimeters 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:42.989
 making a horizontal cut 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:42.989
 thus 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:52.110
 and then we are going to cut into strips 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:03.970
 I'll have to give a little thick because 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:08.220
 is going to crumble 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:08.220
 when we are baking the 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:14.520
 and then we cut in this position 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.520
 and we are going to proceed to marinate the 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:30.820
 the marinade we will make with the pasta 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:33.040
 of souter that we prepared previously 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:34.680
 along with orange juice and juice 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:38.410
 lemon in this case we already have it 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:41.550
 dissolved and we're going to let the 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:41.550
 meat around 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:46.430
 four hours minimum of preferences and 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:50.770
 then if we let him marinate all the 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:50.770
 night will have much better flavor 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:58.750
 let's mix well so your goal is 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:02.810
 that all the meat 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:05.170
 and we are going to cover with a damp cloth 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.820
 and store in the refrigerator 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:09.390
 and prevent the top from drying out 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:09.390
 of the flesh 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:15.460
 I have moistened the cloth 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.610
 let's cover it in this way 

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:20.130
 in agreement 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:23.420
 for habanero or semi chile sauce 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.420
 pec we need 

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:32.260
 6 chiles habaneros 2 cups onion 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:32.260
 chopped purple a cup of lemon juice 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:41.790
 a cup of orange juice and a pinch 

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:41.790
 of salt 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:48.860
 Now we will continue with our sauce 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:51.680
 of habanero pepper 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:55.000
 The first thing we are going to do is cut 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:58.160
 in strips the habanero chile 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:02.440
 removing the seed 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:02.440
 and the veins in this way 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.730
 and we are going to cut it 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:33.300
 and now we are going to continue 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:35.160
 with this sauce 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:39.270
 adding all the ingredients that 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:40.640
 It has purple onion that is an onion 

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:43.640
 with more flavor it is very attractive 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:46.610
 mainly because of its color 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:49.100
 is what is traditionally used in 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:51.670
 raw in salads basically by the 

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:54.440
 flavor that is how I tell them is strong is 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:57.380
 intense and also the color that is very 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:04:01.300
 decorative which we are going to add the 

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:01.300
 chiles the chopped onion 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:04.890
 the lemon game 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:12.890
 and the orange juice 

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:19.970
 this along with a pinch of salt 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:30.070
 with acid orange juice and 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:32.260
 lemon 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:34.120
 basically what we 're going to get is a 

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:36.670
 milder flavor in chiles are going to 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:37.720
 to tan in this marinated me 

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:39.960
 I recommend that at least they do 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:42.520
 four hours before serving 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:45.840
 and we're going to 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:45.840
 and leave in the refrigerator 

00:04:46.129 --> 00:04:50.169
 to bake our cochinita pibil 

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:53.680
 we need 

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:55.569
 four large and medium banana leaves 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:58.499
 cup of vegetable oil or butter 

00:04:55.569 --> 00:04:58.499
 pig will melt 

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:06.590
 we have already marinated our meat 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:09.110
 for 4 hours just like the sauce 

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:10.330
 then we will proceed to pass the leaves 

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:13.199
 of 

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:13.199
 banana 

00:05:13.569 --> 00:05:17.740
 this in order to soften it is not 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:19.539
 leave 

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:21.520
 and also resist a little more heat 

00:05:19.539 --> 00:05:22.860
 let's do it with direct fire 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:25.050
 low 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:26.909
 and with your hands 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:29.479
 at the moment of putting them to start 

00:05:26.909 --> 00:05:29.479
 change color 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:36.419
 to shine a little more the sheet in that 

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:38.810
 moment we continue uniformly with all 

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:38.810
 the sheet 

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:51.710
 once the banana leaf is roasted we are going to 

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:51.710
 proceed 

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:56.650
 put it in a 

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:59.240
 in a pot to bake the meat 

00:05:56.650 --> 00:06:02.229
 let's cover the bottom of the pot with 

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:02.229
 the banana leaves 

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:06.500
 thus 

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:18.570
 and we will try to cover all 

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:18.570
 the parts to make a sachet 

00:06:18.729 --> 00:06:23.870
 let it maintain the humidity of the 

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:26.020
 marinated 

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:29.699
 in the meat 

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:29.699
 so that during the baking process 

00:06:29.729 --> 00:06:36.840
 I do not know I do not know what too 

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:39.030
 now let's proceed to see the meat 

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:41.550
 over the pot we have ready the 

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:43.990
 banana leaves 

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:46.500
 let's pass it 

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:46.500
 here 

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:50.820
 along with all the marinade 

00:07:00.639 --> 00:07:07.120
 Next we are going to add acrylic oil 

00:07:03.879 --> 00:07:09.200
 vegetable oil this too with butter 

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:10.460
 of pork 

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:11.590
 they can do it to their own liking 

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:15.950
 obviously with lard 

00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:18.190
 they will have more flavor but also more fat 

00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:18.190
 animal 

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:25.750
 let's cover perfectly with the 

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:25.750
 banana leaves 

00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:36.539
 now I recommend sprinkling with a little 

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:38.639
 of water the banana leaves this for 

00:07:36.539 --> 00:07:41.270
 avoid drying too much in the oven 

00:07:38.639 --> 00:07:41.270
 and they can burn 

00:07:46.409 --> 00:07:51.239
 and then we can treat it with paper 

00:07:48.119 --> 00:07:54.190
 aluminum and put it in the oven at 210 degrees 

00:07:51.239 --> 00:07:56.440
 for about two hours 

00:07:54.190 --> 00:07:58.780
 after removing from the oven in the 

00:07:56.440 --> 00:08:01.000
 cochinita we have decreased a little the 

00:07:58.780 --> 00:08:03.340
 meat has to be about to be 

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:06.000
 very soft and we present it on a plate 

00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:06.000
 thus
