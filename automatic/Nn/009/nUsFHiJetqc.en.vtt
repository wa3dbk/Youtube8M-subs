yard<00:02:54.130> so<00:02:54.580> the<00:02:55.090> reason<00:02:55.360> why<00:02:55.450> I<00:02:55.480> did<00:02:55.690> that<00:02:55.810> was

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
yard so the reason why I did that was

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:57.450 
yard so the reason why I did that was
and<00:02:56.050> I<00:02:56.110> want<00:02:56.350> to<00:02:56.470> check<00:02:56.740> the<00:02:56.950> corner<00:02:57.310> with<00:02:57.430> the

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:57.460

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
dumpsters of that and if I do that and

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.410 
dumpsters of that and if I do that and
he's<00:02:59.830> magically<00:03:00.400> on<00:03:00.430> the<00:03:00.640> other<00:03:00.910> side<00:03:01.240> of<00:03:01.360> the

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
he's magically on the other side of the

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.120 
he's magically on the other side of the
map<00:03:01.630> then<00:03:02.200> he<00:03:02.320> was<00:03:02.440> gonna<00:03:02.530> be<00:03:02.680> able<00:03:02.800> to<00:03:02.860> take<00:03:03.010> me

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.130 
map then he was gonna be able to take me

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:04.950 
map then he was gonna be able to take me
out<00:03:03.160> easily<00:03:03.490> that's<00:03:04.330> the<00:03:04.450> reason<00:03:04.690> why<00:03:04.810> I'm
