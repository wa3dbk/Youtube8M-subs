00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:12.519
 attempts to combine in one device 

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:14.290
 tablet and laptop almost always 

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:16.299
 They carry a lot of compromises in 

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:18.280
 manufacturers in the end often turns out 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:20.440
 either too bulky tablet or 

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:21.670
 too slow laptop so what if 

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:22.960
 such a transformer can be 

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:25.119
 both productive and 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:27.460
 compact enough to make 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:28.960
 competition ultrabook asus 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:31.330
 sure to find the right recipe 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.100
 crossbreed tablet and laptop embodied 

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:34.420
 your ideas in the transformer book model 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.159
 t300 chi 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:37.989
 asus transformer book t300 chi 

00:00:36.159 --> 00:00:39.190
 Comes in a compact box inside 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:41.649
 which as well as you can find the charger 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:43.089
 device microusb cable and adapter 

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:45.159
 with microusb usb 

00:00:43.089 --> 00:00:46.719
 appearance of the device is slightly different 

00:00:45.159 --> 00:00:47.530
 from what can be seen in ultrabooks 

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:49.719
 of the company 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:51.850
 This model has a simple design without 

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:53.499
 glossy surfaces despite being 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:55.839
 that the body of the tablet is metallic it 

00:00:53.499 --> 00:00:57.699
 covered in matt paint in this way 

00:00:55.839 --> 00:00:59.109
 asus turned out to be a discreet device 

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:00.159
 which is unlikely to attract to itself 

00:00:59.109 --> 00:01:02.319
 a lot of attention 

00:01:00.159 --> 00:01:04.360
 the design here is given for the sake of practicality 

00:01:02.319 --> 00:01:05.830
 which is generally good body materials 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.540
 tablet represented whole 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:09.580
 metal plate on the back 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:11.560
 as well as a protective glass on the front 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:13.720
 the most interesting in asus design 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:16.240
 transformer book t300 chi is the thickness 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:18.010
 shells here she is only 7 and 6 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.510
 millimeters and this is given that 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:21.610
 tablet features pretty 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:23.140
 impressive as a result with strapped 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:25.060
 keyboard device is more like 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:25.840
 compact ultrabook than on a tablet with 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:27.700
 docking station 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.740
 the keyboard case itself is also 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.630
 made of metal in this case unlike 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:33.550
 in the previous generation of Transformers 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:35.590
 asus used not mechanical but 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:38.020
 magnetic mount up to to with keyboard 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:39.610
 disconnecting the device is easier when 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:41.620
 that they are still strong enough 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:43.780
 hold on to each other asus transformer 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:46.120
 book t300 chi at the same time can be 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:47.470
 like laptops with the same tablet 

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:49.360
 electronics device hidden under 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:50.470
 display while dogs keyboard 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:52.390
 practically empty 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:54.550
 as mentioned above they connect with 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:56.200
 using magnets to work with the t300 chi in 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:57.880
 tablet mode is so comfortable 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.880
 how can it be convenient at all 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:02.320
 tablet with windows 81 despite 12 5 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.330
 inch display device still 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:06.040
 it is comfortable to hold in hands several 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:08.079
 looks strange vertical orientation 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:09.399
 due to the elongated screen nevertheless to 

00:02:08.079 --> 00:02:11.439
 you get used to it quickly 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:13.390
 the display responds well enough to 

00:02:11.439 --> 00:02:15.520
 touch and although asus main control 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:17.050
 is exactly through the screen on the case 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:19.180
 tablet you can find the adjustment keys 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:20.920
 volume and power up 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.690
 standard for device operating 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.130
 microsoft windows button in this 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:25.930
 the model is not in the usual place 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:28.780
 under the display and on the left side of the case 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:31.060
 all keys have a clear move and easy 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:32.470
 are by touch block with keyboard 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.940
 clips onto the tablet using 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:35.950
 magnets with the connection itself 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:38.080
 happens via wireless protocol 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:39.700
 bluetooth keys themselves in asus 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.860
 transformer book t300 chi good 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.780
 separated from them a clear pleasant move 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:46.060
 the layout here is typical for ultrabooks 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:47.860
 asus keyboard backlight no what 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:50.140
 is a flaw given 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:52.450
 sufficient thickness of the docking station keys 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:53.650
 have white and green markings which 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:56.410
 reads well even with bad 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:57.940
 Illumination is one of the drawbacks of small 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:59.530
 transformer book thickness t300 chi 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:01.660
 is the lack of full-size 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:03.220
 ports yusb in this regard, the device 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:05.260
 really more like tablets 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:07.030
 than on ultrabooks to the right of his face 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:09.400
 can find 35 millimeter input for 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:11.830
 headphone jack micro with dima and port 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.840
 microusb and 30 last compatible with 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:15.370
 microusb and bundled asus offers 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:17.560
 usb adapter 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:18.489
 This is the right approach as an adapter. 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:21.250
 allows you to connect to the device 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:23.230
 external drives and peripherals in 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:24.579
 the transformer can be installed 12 5 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:28.180
 inch touch ips display with 

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:30.730
 2560 resolution at 1440 calabash points 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:32.500
 Come to us for test was the first option 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:35.440
 which demonstrates excellent clarity 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:37.120
 pictures and good viewing angles to us on 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:39.640
 review hit top grade with 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:41.950
 intel core m5 processor in 71 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:44.680
 operating at a frequency of 1 and 2 gigabytes with in 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:46.720
 normal mode and 2 and 99 rs turbo boost 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:48.820
 since the heat dissipation of core processors 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.769
 m is on low level asus 

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:52.959
 managed to implement in t300 chi full 

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:54.579
 passive cooling system while 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:57.370
 even under high load the tablet is not 

00:03:54.579 --> 00:03:59.200
 heats up above 45 degrees celsius in 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:01.600
 reality lower right corner device 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:03.760
 becomes noticeable warm nuruku with 

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:06.280
 This does not burn in addition to 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:07.810
 processor 581 in our version of asus 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:09.730
 transformer book t300 chi was 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:11.859
 installed 8 gigabytes of operational 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:13.480
 the device works as a whole 

00:04:11.859 --> 00:04:15.220
 quite quickly speaking of such 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:17.079
 basic task like browsing sites 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:19.180
 working with mail and creating a document in 

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:19.840
 presentations and editing 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:21.280
 photos 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:22.900
 but generally wait incredible 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:25.180
 performance from the tablet are not worth 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:26.979
 which is also confirmed by synthetic 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:29.110
 and performance tests are 

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:31.210
 at a good level if we talk about t300 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:32.949
 chi like compact laptops and on 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:36.070
 high if you compare it with others 

00:04:32.949 --> 00:04:38.110
 windows t300 chi tablets installed 2 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:39.580
 I'm honest battery at 32 here an hour 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:41.110
 which when the load is above average 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:42.729
 enough for 4 hours of work 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:44.710
 mixed mode tablet can 

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:47.350
 last six to seven hours 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:48.970
 minimum load of about 10 in the end 

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:50.560
 device autonomy can be called 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:52.300
 average to hold a full-time worker 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:54.550
 day on one battery she is not 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:56.620
 can in this plan more attractive 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:58.509
 Looks like a version with full hd screen 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:59.289
 which this news is at 20-30 percent 

00:04:58.509 --> 00:05:01.840
 above 

00:04:59.289 --> 00:05:03.460
 asus transformer book t300 chi captivates 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:05.410
 its form factor device 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:06.370
 turned out quite compact but with 

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:08.500
 it has a full keyboard 

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:09.039
 which can be left at the office when she 

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:10.840
 not needed 

00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:12.880
 disadvantages of this model are typical for 

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:14.500
 convergent windows devices namely 

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:16.330
 small number of ports and medium 

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:18.370
 autonomy nonetheless amid 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:19.150
 similar models t300 chi has a number 

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:21.070
 advantages 

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:22.570
 he is fast enough has a good 

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:24.820
 the screen is completely silent in operation 

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:26.440
 equipped with a good keyboard as well 

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:28.120
 touchpad so if you don't 

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:29.889
 stared at the surprise 3 pro from 

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:30.669
 microsoft which unfortunately does not come to us 

00:05:29.889 --> 00:05:32.500
 supplied 

00:05:30.669 --> 00:05:33.909
 look also at asus transformer 

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:35.830
 book t300 chi 

00:05:33.909 --> 00:05:39.210
 at the moment it is the best transformer 

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:39.210
 available in the Ukrainian market
