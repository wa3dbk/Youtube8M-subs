00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:06.270
 the basin would not be enough 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:08.069
 here it comes to me and that makes sense 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:11.300
 this is followed by barbecue 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.300
 Rheinhessen have fun 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:43.739
 We now see the ingredients we for 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.780
 our show rietschel will need 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.360
 los s goes naturally with the charité 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.620
 the show is a spanish road where is 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.690
 in the a lot of paprika powder 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.910
 has been processed correctly 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.589
 and really really delicious then I have 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.769
 Freshly tapped thyme next to it 

00:00:55.589 --> 00:01:00.659
 smoked garlic cloves then I have 

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:03.080
 red onion a whole lot of noise 

00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:07.049
 of chili powder maple syrup 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:08.909
 balsamic vinegar brown sugar olive oil 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.649
 and of course we still need it 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.210
 a big bus ride in the whole 

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:14.490
 then I'll do it and then I will 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.890
 say to the board prepare 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.780
 I start that school 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.820
 First cut into smaller pieces 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.110
 I take such a sausage and 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:31.350
 you first cut the length 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:34.159
 down and then from it smaller 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.159
 to make dice 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:46.060
 so it stays perfect when these dice 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:47.110
 will have that strength and then 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:49.210
 cut the others first 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:50.740
 May be small and then we see the 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:51.310
 School is now in my chest 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:52.840
 took 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:54.010
 maybe one or the other 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.170
 asked why I do not have the balls 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:57.160
 that was easy to do 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:58.990
 so is a pretty greasy one 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:00.130
 matter and if you like the pel 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.140
 she just has a lot to do with it 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:03.310
 much better cut to the topic 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.080
 I cut the red ones here 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:06.640
 Onions are about to become equal now 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:07.420
 peeled and then in rough pieces 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.030
 sliced 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.830
 the garlic is peeled on and fine 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:13.480
 hacked is important but now first 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.070
 to put the pan on the stove 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.480
 a temperature setting seven of 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:18.460
 Ten, I'll be the next one now 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.630
 half an hour, the study too slowly 

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:22.209
 So let them handle the horse properly 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:23.920
 beautiful and then we see each other 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:25.270
 right back so i have been diligent and 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.130
 peeled the red onions and 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:29.110
 cut the garlic finely chopped 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:30.910
 and the thyme side ripped off now 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:32.650
 Let's see what our school is now 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:34.209
 a good quarter of an hour in the bus driver 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:35.410
 also needs loose normal 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:37.180
 quarter of an hour know so far is 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:38.890
 in between stirring again and again 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:40.390
 she does not get dark but that looks 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:41.380
 fantastic from people smell 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:43.600
 incomprehensible 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:45.010
 and when I'm finished we look at each other 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:47.290
 the pan again a good half hour 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.220
 later sail school together look like this 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:50.230
 that a lot of fat 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:51.400
 come together and I will be under 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:53.530
 no circumstances mountain I have here 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:56.530
 already put a pot together with 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:59.050
 So now the jury is pouring the sieve 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:00.040
 catch the fat in any case and 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:02.050
 That should not be a cover 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.330
 but just like the wm 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:05.640
 he can also ask me something then 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:08.350
 almost done with the fat 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:10.260
 You can make scrambled eggs wonderful 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:12.580
 what can you do with it wonderfully 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:14.769
 think so many possibilities something 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:16.600
 searing wanted to use the same 

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:17.940
 Just fix this that it absolutely 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.810
 gigantic 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:21.250
 is very important if you then the 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:22.750
 bus driver touches it up 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:24.220
 no case only with the fingers 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:26.110
 used towel so that your fingers 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:28.420
 burns now we leave here 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:30.670
 school to drain and then it works 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:31.930
 right next to the pan and directly 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:33.340
 it continues on the flag the flag 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:35.650

 not so dry to yourself 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:43.310
 just a little bit now 

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:46.189
 back so that you drive then two 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:49.099
