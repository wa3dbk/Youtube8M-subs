multicenter<00:01:16.770> trials<00:01:17.220> in<00:01:17.369> clinical<00:01:18.119> trials

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
multicenter trials in clinical trials

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.630 
multicenter trials in clinical trials
pending<00:01:19.110> review<00:01:19.229> by<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:19.619> fda<00:01:20.040> and<00:01:20.130> so<00:01:20.490> we

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
pending review by the fda and so we

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:21.859 
pending review by the fda and so we
think<00:01:20.820> this<00:01:20.970> is<00:01:21.150> actually<00:01:21.330> going<00:01:21.659> to<00:01:21.750> go

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
think this is actually going to go

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.480 
think this is actually going to go
through<00:01:22.080> and<00:01:22.200> get<00:01:22.320> approved<00:01:22.650> by<00:01:22.799> the<00:01:22.860> FDA<00:01:23.250> it's

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
through and get approved by the FDA it's

have<00:01:43.500> to<00:01:43.619> pay<00:01:43.799> for<00:01:43.860> each<00:01:44.130> of<00:01:44.280> these<00:01:44.369> treatments

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
have to pay for each of these treatments

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.719 
have to pay for each of these treatments
and<00:01:45.000> is<00:01:45.270> it<00:01:45.509> safe<00:01:45.990> it's<00:01:46.560> basically<00:01:47.490> going<00:01:47.670> to

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
and is it safe it's basically going to

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.240 
and is it safe it's basically going to
be<00:01:47.850> around<00:01:48.119> 400<00:01:48.390> to<00:01:48.750> $1,000<00:01:49.560> a<00:01:49.590> treatment<00:01:50.040> so

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
be around 400 to $1,000 a treatment so

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.520 
be around 400 to $1,000 a treatment so
that<00:01:50.430> can<00:01:50.700> add<00:01:51.060> up<00:01:51.299> to<00:01:51.450> about<00:01:51.750> the<00:01:51.900> cost<00:01:52.110> of<00:01:52.320> one

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
that can add up to about the cost of one

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.800 
that can add up to about the cost of one
liposuction<00:01:53.369> procedure<00:01:53.790> but<00:01:54.420> hey<00:01:54.600> it's

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
liposuction procedure but hey it's

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.050 
liposuction procedure but hey it's
non-invasive<00:01:55.350> it's<00:01:55.830> non<00:01:56.009> painful<00:01:56.549> no

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060

within<00:03:24.940> about<00:03:25.150> an<00:03:25.420> hour<00:03:25.570> but<00:03:26.170> it<00:03:26.320> doesn't

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620 
within about an hour but it doesn't

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:28.620 
within about an hour but it doesn't
affect<00:03:26.710> anything<00:03:27.250> deeper<00:03:27.760> than<00:03:27.940> the<00:03:28.090> below

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:28.630

the bleeding that liposuction can cause

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:36.900 
the bleeding that liposuction can cause
and<00:03:34.660> so<00:03:35.200> we<00:03:35.380> haven't<00:03:35.770> seen<00:03:36.040> many<00:03:36.220> side<00:03:36.580> effects

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:36.910 
and so we haven't seen many side effects

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:40.130 
and so we haven't seen many side effects
at<00:03:37.090> all<00:03:37.270> where<00:03:38.200> is<00:03:38.320> it<00:03:38.440> coming<00:03:38.650> I<00:03:39.010> want<00:03:39.400> it<00:03:39.580> now

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.140 
at all where is it coming I want it now

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:42.840 
at all where is it coming I want it now
can<00:03:41.140> we<00:03:41.260> get<00:03:41.410> it<00:03:41.500> in<00:03:41.620> two<00:03:42.190> weeks<00:03:42.400> you<00:03:42.640> can<00:03:42.760> be

can we get it in two weeks you can be

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:45.510 
can we get it in two weeks you can be
down<00:03:43.030> a<00:03:43.060> gene<00:03:43.450> size<00:03:43.750> I<00:03:43.870> love<00:03:44.170> it<00:03:44.320> it<00:03:45.220> will<00:03:45.370> be

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:45.520 
down a gene size I love it it will be

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:47.220 
down a gene size I love it it will be
mass<00:03:45.760> appeal<00:03:46.180> it<00:03:46.420> will<00:03:46.540> change<00:03:46.750> the<00:03:46.990> face<00:03:47.200> of

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:47.230 
mass appeal it will change the face of

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:49.170 
mass appeal it will change the face of
cosmetic<00:03:47.860> procedures<00:03:48.340> in<00:03:48.550> the<00:03:48.610> United<00:03:48.940> States

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:49.180 
cosmetic procedures in the United States

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:51.450 
cosmetic procedures in the United States
what<00:03:49.330> do<00:03:49.420> you<00:03:49.480> think<00:03:49.690> a<00:03:49.780> year<00:03:50.290> well<00:03:51.190> I<00:03:51.220> think

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:51.460 
what do you think a year well I think

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:54.030 
what do you think a year well I think
the<00:03:52.030> FDA<00:03:52.150> likes<00:03:52.630> to<00:03:52.840> scrutinize<00:03:53.320> very<00:03:53.650> hard

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:54.040 
the FDA likes to scrutinize very hard

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:55.620 
the FDA likes to scrutinize very hard
like<00:03:54.250> they<00:03:54.400> did<00:03:54.580> silicone<00:03:55.030> breast<00:03:55.240> implants

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:55.630 
like they did silicone breast implants

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:57.240 
like they did silicone breast implants
so<00:03:55.720> we're<00:03:55.870> the<00:03:55.990> last<00:03:56.140> in<00:03:56.440> the<00:03:56.560> world<00:03:56.740> to<00:03:56.980> get<00:03:57.100> it

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.250 
so we're the last in the world to get it

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:59.730 
so we're the last in the world to get it
as<00:03:57.370> usual<00:03:57.580> but<00:03:58.240> probably<00:03:58.750> within<00:03:59.050> two<00:03:59.440> years

00:03:59.730 --> 00:03:59.740 
as usual but probably within two years

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:00.780 
as usual but probably within two years
it's<00:04:00.100> what<00:04:00.220> they're<00:04:00.370> saying<00:04:00.610> and

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:00.790 
it's what they're saying and

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:03.050 
it's what they're saying and
unfortunately<00:04:01.360> phase<00:04:01.540> 3<00:04:01.870> can<00:04:02.050> last<00:04:02.260> years

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
unfortunately phase 3 can last years

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:04.980 
unfortunately phase 3 can last years
phase<00:04:04.060> 3<00:04:04.300> which<00:04:04.450> is<00:04:04.480> where<00:04:04.720> they're<00:04:04.840> what

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:04.990 
phase 3 which is where they're what

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:06.900 
phase 3 which is where they're what
they're<00:04:05.140> in<00:04:05.260> now<00:04:05.440> the<00:04:06.220> last<00:04:06.430> range<00:04:06.760> of

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:06.910 
they're in now the last range of

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:09.000 
they're in now the last range of
clinical<00:04:07.330> trials<00:04:07.690> but<00:04:07.840> it's<00:04:08.440> gotten<00:04:08.680> that<00:04:08.710> far

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:09.010 
clinical trials but it's gotten that far

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:10.770 
clinical trials but it's gotten that far
so<00:04:09.220> we<00:04:09.340> think<00:04:09.490> it<00:04:09.640> will<00:04:09.760> be<00:04:09.940> approved<00:04:10.210> isn't<00:04:10.690> it

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:10.780 
so we think it will be approved isn't it

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:12.840 
so we think it will be approved isn't it
it<00:04:11.380> is<00:04:11.500> nice<00:04:11.740> to<00:04:11.770> think<00:04:12.010> about<00:04:12.400> at<00:04:12.550> least<00:04:12.640> the

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:12.850 
it is nice to think about at least the

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:14.220 
it is nice to think about at least the
thought<00:04:13.000> of<00:04:13.150> losing<00:04:13.270> a<00:04:13.480> few<00:04:13.630> inches<00:04:13.780> around

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:14.230 
thought of losing a few inches around

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:16.890 
thought of losing a few inches around
you<00:04:14.880> just<00:04:15.880> sit<00:04:16.060> under<00:04:16.239> the<00:04:16.330> machine<00:04:16.630> and<00:04:16.810> then

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:16.900 
you just sit under the machine and then

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:19.050 
you just sit under the machine and then
you're<00:04:17.080> off<00:04:17.230> doctor<00:04:17.890> therefore<00:04:18.220> Walden<00:04:18.549> thank

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:19.060 
you're off doctor therefore Walden thank

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:22.260 
you're off doctor therefore Walden thank
