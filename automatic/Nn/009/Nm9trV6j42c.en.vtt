00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:10.220
 the girls very good guys inhibited and 

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:13.340
 we are in the video that many 

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:16.760
 you were asking for the perfect command 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:19.070
 because if the command of xbox one seems 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:21.619
 be that is going to take all the compliments 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:24.860
 of all the players and insiders because 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:28.160
 the next command the wrong xbox controller 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:30.670
 called elite is a command that you want 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:33.190
 have at all costs 

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:35.860
 Well then this what it costs 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:38.500
 truth is that it is an attractive command and 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:41.860
 really intended for those who the 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:44.230
 they can already allow that good 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:46.660
 price is talking about what can 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:50.739
 even to be worth approximately 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:52.410
 $ 150 a price which 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:55.710
 Really 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:58.350
 it's a little expensive, you have to say it clearly 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:01.620
 for a command logically but you have to 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:04.890
 say that the accessories they carry 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:07.970
 the customization options that are 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:10.850
 they can get to have are really 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:13.290
 spectacular not as you know 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:14.180
 Microsoft wants to go for the public 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.670
 competitive 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:20.570
 those who seek the best possible quality 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.570
 for a command 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.440
 and although it has to be said that the command of 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.780
 xbox one already in itself is good you see that 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:30.540
 for the competitive world is not 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:34.229
 enough and look for something else there is 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.220
 say that well we have to talk about 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.160
 this command that you are seeing there the 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:40.619
 images are really spectacular 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:43.110
 some pieces are not logically in 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.869
 the original configuration the sticks the 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:48.870
 rear bullets and the crosshead are 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:51.270
 completely removable 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:54.450
 they emphasize that they are surprisingly 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.190
 easy to remove people you have to have 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.970
 slightly outward and the part leaves 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:02.250
 single as much of sticks as of the crosshead 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:04.200
 do not force or make movements 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.270
 strangers and the best of all is that a 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.580
 despite being a process such a process 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:11.280
 simple then when the piece is 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:13.140
 coupled the piece does not wag or is that 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.480
 it has a perfect robustness they can not stand 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.909
 all right 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:21.799
 the touch and in my moment it gives the sensation 

00:02:16.909 --> 00:02:24.200
 I go to move or fall not know 

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:27.200
 they say that also the buttons have 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:30.290
 something else about the distribution of 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:32.480
 the metal rear legs back then 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:35.780
 good at the moment of truth are good 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:37.760
 positioned and do that at the time of 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:40.849
 play the beats are more comfortable 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:44.269
 in fact there are about two little buttons that 

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:46.010
 you set so good you can adjust the 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:49.579
 movement of the triggers with these 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:52.040
 buttons and it really is a great option 

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:54.680
 the response time in the model 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:58.130
 wireless is commented from the fair 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:03:00.500
 which is practically imperceptible 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:01.190
 and the truth is that good will have to be seen 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:03.680
 moving 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:05.470
 unfortunately, well, how are you? 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:08.680
 seeing 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:13.000
 there was not there was not a sample of 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:15.940
 pieces to be able to change and be able to try 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.770
 each one of them what they could not 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:20.200
 do the specialized veis is to try 

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:23.080
 command with a game to really see 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:25.270
 the response time is not the truth 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:27.400
 that the media that have 

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:29.380
 tried the command to highlight that has 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:32.250
 the best feeling of control and 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:35.310
 travel they have tried so far and 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:38.060
 the truth is that 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:41.940
 there is a lot of desire to see him in action 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:43.650
 it is spoken that can be good is spoken of 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:46.230
 the possibility of re-mapping the four 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:47.849
 of the four buttons and even adjust 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:49.630
 the sensitivity curve of the sticks 

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:52.990
 analog 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:55.930
 how good they look with very good options 

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:57.590
 for the competitive public the truth is 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:59.900
 what 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:01.610
 Paints very well is the command a command 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:04.700
 excellent maybe the only downside is the 

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:06.680
 excessive price I think that 150 is a 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:08.420
 price too expensive than 100 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:10.459
 it would have been fine but the options 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:13.780
 who has the command and the options that you 

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:16.310
 can give maybe it's worth it 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:17.769
 comment you already know many thanks 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:22.090
 for being there I hope you liked it 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:22.090
 see you in the next chao
