 I will not answer these questions 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:05.930
 as a hobby worth seeing in 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:09.020
 cinema 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:12.160

 advise to reconsider 4k 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:21.290
 will open for you a new genre called it 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:24.230
 specific documentary 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:26.209
 this is the kind of movie when events 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:28.190
 removed as there is no 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:31.370
 performances and most importantly actors 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:32.989
 this is our planet earth and one of 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:35.180
 examples of such a species 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:37.459
 documentaries is a movie of landscapes 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:40.100
 time 2012 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:42.590
 no big- name names of star compositions 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:45.019
 only beauty around us 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:47.000
 if you are among the visual 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:48.980
 aesthetes then be sure to look at this 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.670
 movie in good resolution at large 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:53.069
 tv 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:55.249
 mountains lakes waterfalls wilderness animals 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:59.599
 sometimes people are all shot in super quality 

00:02:55.249 --> 00:02:59.599
 brings maximum pleasure 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:14.890
 if you are interested in paintings landscapes 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:17.500
 time and you want to view y on 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:19.689
 its 4 to the TV even prepared 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.469
 390 gigabytes of hard drive space 

00:03:19.689 --> 00:03:23.019
 drive 

00:03:20.469 --> 00:03:26.049
 but don't know where to download forced you 

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:27.909
 disappoint but condemn piracy and in 

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:30.930
 particular rutracker on which this 

00:03:27.909 --> 00:03:30.930
 film can be found 

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:37.569
 there are movies when you watch which 

00:03:35.409 --> 00:03:40.120
 breathtaking from special effects and 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:43.180
 I want to revise them more often and 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:45.519
 more often such films as the avengers 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:48.909
 and what about serials is there anything 

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:52.419
 similar cool and comic well and arrow 

00:03:48.909 --> 00:03:55.120
 already had such a series then we discussed 

00:03:52.419 --> 00:03:57.549
 literally last time is the time for 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:59.650
 shield show agents will tell us about 

00:03:57.549 --> 00:04:01.780
 weekdays secret organization which 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:04.000
 investigates strange crimes 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:06.430
 the weirdness is that to them 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.379
 involved either supermen or a guest from 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:11.109
 other planets either mysterious 

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:12.790
 artifacts ball rule seems to be lost 

00:04:11.109 --> 00:04:14.949
 the avengers phil colson 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:17.799
 true here he is mysteriously alive 

00:04:14.949 --> 00:04:19.750
 still have mega cool ming on which 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:22.150
 playing no less cool melinda may 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:24.340
 series is built on the principle of monster 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:27.370
 weeks every episode there is a problem 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:29.289
 which the gallant cheaters decide I will say 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:31.599
 immediately wait from the show the same 

00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:33.820
 impressions like the movie the avengers do not 

00:04:31.599 --> 00:04:36.159
 worth it though marvel fans will 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:39.070
 rejoice like children yes agree with you 

00:04:36.159 --> 00:04:41.289
 if you say that the agents of the shield are not 4k 

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:43.900
 but if you happen to be 

00:04:41.289 --> 00:04:45.789
 owner of ultra easy tv from 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:46.900

00:04:45.789 --> 00:04:49.240
 function 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:52.470

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:04.880
 one young and tanned guy leads

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:11.780
 technical frills 

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:13.850
 but its main advantage is that 

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:17.210
 he does his reviews in super super 

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:18.440

 it is useful however the guy speaks distinctly 

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:33.350
