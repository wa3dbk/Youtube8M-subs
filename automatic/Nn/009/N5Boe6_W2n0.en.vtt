00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:05.540
 hello my name is alex I do not pretend that 

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:08.120
 this video lasts a long time since really 

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:10.099
 does not have what I would call a lot 

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:12.079
 information but it 's information what 

00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:14.869
 relevant enough to upload a 

00:00:12.079 --> 00:00:16.849
 video to my liking so let's do it in 

00:00:14.869 --> 00:00:18.830
 the famous files of network forums and 

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:20.390
 some goods are being filtered 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:22.910
 leave the five more guardians 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:25.490
 specifically old weapons that we're 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:27.439
 observing back or modifications to 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:28.249
 certain attributes of the gameplay and that already 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:30.050
 we know 

00:00:28.249 --> 00:00:32.599
 before showing images should i 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:34.910
 inform them something the catches have a 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:35.539
 somewhat low graphic quality in the 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:37.100
 weapons 

00:00:35.539 --> 00:00:39.050
 frank o'connor context the leaks 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.879
 that these models are working 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.980
 beta code and not pay them 

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:45.079
 attention remember that it is content 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.820
 filtering that is being the most object 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:49.280
 to changes since it is for something that the 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:51.379
 company is not showing it with that in 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.940
 I will start with the attributes the 

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:54.859
 look at the acid m &amp; r 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:57.590
 significantly improved for not 

00:00:54.859 --> 00:00:59.719
 emit too much visibility on screen 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:01.460
 is the look during the beta and 

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:03.859
 this is the look with which one is 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.710
 currently working much better already 

00:01:03.859 --> 00:01:07.870
 who is still using the look 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:11.000
 simply in a more 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:12.860
 smart that was lousy the envelopes 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.960
 shields are back in gel or such and 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:16.580
 as expected, they have a strange 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.470
 and unique brightness of green color 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:20.450
 different from other deliveries and 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:22.820
 of report quiz and even as if the 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.770
 brightness was badly functioning which 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:26.900
 This is probably the case since 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:29.030
 reported that the hd indicated that he had 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:31.100
 still about over shields even before 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:32.870
 of dying the weapons now have a 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.700
 Brightness of blue color of outline when 

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:36.860
 they are lying on the floor with 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.900
 the purpose of better identification in the 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:41.090
 battlefield especially in 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:43.700
 dark sections a problem that was 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:45.590
 very present in the beta of halo 5 the 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.870
 death chambers were not present 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:49.510
 in this demonstration you could affect 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:51.260
 other players while you were dead 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:53.300
 characteristic that had already been 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:55.610
 required in halo for a while 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:57.590
 the spartan conversations had been 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:59.240
 reduced enough their dialogues are more 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.220
 concise with what is happening and 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.740
 speak more to indicate the position of 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:05.960
 enemy or the availability of weapons the 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:08.179
 fist against the floor is slightly more 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:10.160
 slow to use equally has a lower 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:11.480
 impact radio however it is more 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.030
 simple to use now compares 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:16.280
 of the vein simply less accessible 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:17.989
 the screen feedback is 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.180
 say what is on screen 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:22.129
 it has also changed now tells you what 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.019
 player killed the other player and with what 

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:26.239
 weapon did it no longer there is companionship 

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:28.040
 spartan at the end of the games now 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:30.349
 they all walk together towards the screen 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.150
 rather than celebrate and make their poses 

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:34.370
 of the throne down forward the network with 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:36.440
 is back from halo 4 and it works 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:38.569
 practically the same as it used to 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:40.700
 however now it has a capacity of 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:42.560
 11 shots the barrel incineration 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:44.000
 find again in halo 5 guardians 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.950
 but its operation number of 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.599
 shots has been altered now it works 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:49.640
 similar to plasma weapons with a 

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:51.620
 Charger instead of ammunition is charged 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:53.510
 like a plasma gun and it depends on 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:55.700
 how long do you hold the charge shoots 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:57.859
 stronger the bag has also changed 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.989
 since its appearance in halo 4 it no longer has 

00:02:57.859 --> 00:03:02.150
 a shotgun style shooting mode has 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:04.129
 a single shooting mode which also 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:05.660
 is new shoots two shots at the same 

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:08.629
 time which have a small 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:10.579
 crawling small enemy tracking not 

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:13.340
 wait for a projectile of trajectory of 

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:15.230
 heat or something like that 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:17.390
 the supervisor also return 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:19.129
 guardians but without many changes their 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:21.890
 the biggest difference is that it shoots more 

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:24.019
 slow agreeing with the report much more 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:26.090
 slow the firing speed of the 

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:27.800
 magnum has been diminished but the value 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:29.629
 of damage of each shot has been 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:31.489
 increased works in essence something 

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:33.920
 similar to an invitation of the magnum 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:35.840
 leave it with barwa the rifle version of 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:38.390
 battle shown here was bestial 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:40.610
 shot very fast and very strong though 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:42.560
 the filter feeder states that this simply 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:44.900
 to test possible alterations in the 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:47.180
 value of damage and not how you plan to leave it 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:49.069
 and now if that has been everything I think 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:52.220
 that there should not be anything new until 

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:54.200
 e3 but at this point I can no longer guess 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:55.970
 we'll see if you liked this video 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:58.250
 subscribe if you contained me entirely 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:00.349
 leave it already makes news or curiosities 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:02.209
 give me a like that inspires me to go up 

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:03.950
 much more and as we will always see 

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:06.680
 until next time 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:09.579
 thank you very much for watching qatar a 3-4-3 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:09.579
 outside
