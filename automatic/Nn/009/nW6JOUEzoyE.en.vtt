00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
 welcome to another video is me and eyes 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:05.009
 of pokemon and good this time 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.290
 I bring a piece of information 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.330
 new information about pokemon ruby omega 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:12.150
 and alpha sapphire and is just 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.040
 confirm the new mega evolution of 6 b 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.080
 line so is the third pokemon 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.910
 generation a pokémon that already in itself 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.039
 it was pretty good the truth that has 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:23.220
 a good combination of types had 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.859
 ghostly sinister team and thanks to 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.810
 this combination in sixth generation 

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:28.920
 he only had a weakness zone what 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.320
 which makes it not a pokémon 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.460
 pretty good it's true although the only thing 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.280
 bad is that with statistics 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.380
 pretty poor but that did not matter 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.320
 nothing because even if I had statistics 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.450
 very poor of course that this pokemon looked 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.010
 too much and thanks to his skill that 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.320
 I was joking that all the 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.360
 movements that were so to speak 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.969
 that do not cause direct damage they had 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.530
 priority so imagine yourself now 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.120
 we have a mega evolution in fact 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.219
 obviously here you are seeing the image 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.260
 what am I putting of this mega 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.969
 evolution of mega silverlight we can 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.190
 see that the truth is practically the same 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.329
 simply the only changes that arrive 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.119
 To suffer 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.979
 this mega pokemon has a big shield 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.200
 a large shield that looks like a ruby 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.270
 a little crazy little theory not 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.549
 I know what you think, I think there will be 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.200
 two variations of mega tv line here 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.119
 leave comments and also believe it 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.070
 I mean a mega ceibe light 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:22.500
 will be with a giant ruby ​​obviously for 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:25.320
 ruby or mega and another mega saver light will be 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.270
 pau with an equally giant sapphire 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.850
 obviously one for each version 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.229
 respectively it is a small hypothesis 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.479
 I have the truth that I do not know what 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:36.000
 you think but good really that 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.259
 we know from this pokemon that good in 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.690
 the little information that they gave us 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:41.700
 more than statistics or something for that 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:43.259
 style we can get to notice that it's going to 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.940
 be a more defensive pokémon so 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:47.130
 imagine a silver lake that is already 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:49.380
 yes it was pretty good being more 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.880
 defensive is still really a 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.709
 pokémon that will give a lot of that 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.450
 talk a very interesting pokémon the 

00:01:52.709 --> 00:01:56.880
 truth and that if you increase the 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.159
 statistics in the boom believe me not 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.830
 there's going to be absolutely nothing that can 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:03.270
 stop at a mega seibel line but good 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:04.380
 it would be all for this moment I hope that 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.850
