my name is Ben Bartel and I'm a

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:13.370 
my name is Ben Bartel and I'm a
postdoctoral<00:00:11.580> researcher<00:00:12.360> here<00:00:12.690> at<00:00:12.780> MIT<00:00:12.990> in

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
postdoctoral researcher here at MIT in

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.770 
postdoctoral researcher here at MIT in
the<00:00:13.500> lab<00:00:13.800> of<00:00:13.830> Alan<00:00:14.280> jazzing<00:00:14.670> off<00:00:14.790> and<00:00:15.150> what<00:00:15.660> we

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
the lab of Alan jazzing off and what we

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.600 
the lab of Alan jazzing off and what we
do<00:00:15.960> is<00:00:16.139> we<00:00:16.260> develop<00:00:16.500> new<00:00:16.680> technologies<00:00:17.400> these

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:17.610 
do is we develop new technologies these

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:19.820 
do is we develop new technologies these
sensors<00:00:18.150> for<00:00:18.420> looking<00:00:18.779> at<00:00:18.900> neurotransmitters

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
sensors for looking at neurotransmitters

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.310 
sensors for looking at neurotransmitters
and<00:00:20.220> the<00:00:21.180> purpose<00:00:21.480> of<00:00:21.510> this<00:00:21.630> is<00:00:21.779> to<00:00:21.900> give<00:00:22.050> us<00:00:22.170> a

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
and the purpose of this is to give us a

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.700 
and the purpose of this is to give us a
new<00:00:22.590> viewpoint<00:00:23.340> on<00:00:23.640> how<00:00:23.910> the<00:00:23.970> brain<00:00:24.300> works

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:24.710 
new viewpoint on how the brain works

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:27.500 
new viewpoint on how the brain works
we've<00:00:25.710> been<00:00:25.860> moving<00:00:26.580> along<00:00:26.820> this<00:00:26.970> thinking<00:00:27.360> of

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
we've been moving along this thinking of

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.359 
we've been moving along this thinking of
the<00:00:27.630> brain<00:00:27.930> as<00:00:28.110> a<00:00:28.140> computer<00:00:28.260> for<00:00:29.010> a<00:00:29.039> very<00:00:29.190> long

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
the brain as a computer for a very long

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.490 
the brain as a computer for a very long
time<00:00:29.640> and<00:00:29.970> that<00:00:30.390> metaphor<00:00:30.750> is<00:00:30.840> great<00:00:31.110> and<00:00:31.350> it's

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
time and that metaphor is great and it's

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.610 
time and that metaphor is great and it's
kind<00:00:31.680> of<00:00:31.770> true<00:00:32.099> but<00:00:32.690> if<00:00:33.690> you<00:00:33.840> look<00:00:34.080> at<00:00:34.230> how<00:00:34.559> the

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
kind of true but if you look at how the

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.189 
kind of true but if you look at how the
brain<00:00:35.059> acts<00:00:36.059> it<00:00:36.600> doesn't<00:00:36.870> act<00:00:36.989> like<00:00:37.170> a

00:00:37.189 --> 00:00:37.199 
brain acts it doesn't act like a

00:00:37.199 --> 00:00:39.470 
brain acts it doesn't act like a
computer<00:00:37.680> it<00:00:37.860> has<00:00:38.160> this<00:00:38.430> very<00:00:38.610> emergent<00:00:39.360> or

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
computer it has this very emergent or

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.110 
computer it has this very emergent or
improvisational<00:00:40.290> property<00:00:40.830> and<00:00:41.070> to<00:00:41.519> me<00:00:41.729> it's

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
improvisational property and to me it's

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.880 
improvisational property and to me it's
actually<00:00:42.540> more<00:00:42.659> like<00:00:42.720> music<00:00:43.350> like<00:00:43.559> it's<00:00:43.769> a

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
actually more like music like it's a

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.829 
actually more like music like it's a
multi-billion<00:00:44.550> number<00:00:45.030> smoking<00:00:45.600> jazz

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:45.839 
multi-billion number smoking jazz

00:00:45.839 --> 00:00:47.930 
multi-billion number smoking jazz
ensemble<00:00:46.650> that's<00:00:46.830> playing<00:00:47.129> some<00:00:47.370> music<00:00:47.489> that

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
ensemble that's playing some music that

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.410 
ensemble that's playing some music that
only<00:00:48.360> they<00:00:48.870> can<00:00:49.080> hear<00:00:49.470> and<00:00:49.970> if<00:00:50.970> you<00:00:51.180> think

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
only they can hear and if you think

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.149 
only they can hear and if you think
about<00:00:51.540> electrical<00:00:52.530> activity<00:00:52.949> in<00:00:52.979> the<00:00:53.070> brain

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:53.159 
about electrical activity in the brain

00:00:53.159 --> 00:00:54.770 
about electrical activity in the brain
that<00:00:53.370> is<00:00:53.549> also<00:00:53.940> very<00:00:54.150> true<00:00:54.420> and<00:00:54.540> it's

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
that is also very true and it's

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.630 
that is also very true and it's
important<00:00:55.290> but<00:00:55.500> it's<00:00:55.979> not<00:00:56.100> like<00:00:56.400> there's

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
important but it's not like there's

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.969 
important but it's not like there's
sparks<00:00:57.299> jumping<00:00:57.750> between<00:00:57.870> neurons<00:00:58.290> there

00:00:58.969 --> 00:00:58.979 
sparks jumping between neurons there

00:00:58.979 --> 00:01:00.250 
sparks jumping between neurons there
these<00:00:59.100> chemicals<00:00:59.670> called<00:01:00.000> neurotransmitters

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:00.260 
these chemicals called neurotransmitters

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:04.399 
these chemicals called neurotransmitters
that<00:01:01.260> make<00:01:01.500> up<00:01:01.680> that<00:01:01.710> signal<00:01:02.190> so<00:01:03.409> imaging

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
that make up that signal so imaging

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.160 
that make up that signal so imaging
methods<00:01:04.710> like<00:01:04.860> fMRI<00:01:05.430> or<00:01:06.170> electrophysiology

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
methods like fMRI or electrophysiology

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.530 
methods like fMRI or electrophysiology
or<00:01:07.409> calcium<00:01:08.040> imaging<00:01:08.159> these<00:01:09.030> all<00:01:09.150> look<00:01:09.299> at<00:01:09.420> the

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
or calcium imaging these all look at the

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.070 
or calcium imaging these all look at the
neurons<00:01:09.930> and<00:01:10.260> kind<00:01:10.920> of<00:01:10.979> associated<00:01:12.080> factors

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
neurons and kind of associated factors

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.780 
neurons and kind of associated factors
but<00:01:13.230> they<00:01:13.380> don't<00:01:13.620> look<00:01:14.340> at<00:01:14.520> neuro

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
but they don't look at neuro

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.420 
but they don't look at neuro
transmissions<00:01:15.420> specifically<00:01:16.350> that's<00:01:17.190> this

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
transmissions specifically that's this

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.640 
transmissions specifically that's this
process<00:01:18.000> of<00:01:18.180> of<00:01:18.450> chemicals<00:01:19.110> getting<00:01:19.350> blown

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
process of of chemicals getting blown

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.590 
process of of chemicals getting blown
out<00:01:19.860> and<00:01:19.920> sustained<00:01:20.490> and<00:01:20.790> drawn<00:01:21.090> back<00:01:21.390> in

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
out and sustained and drawn back in

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.660 
out and sustained and drawn back in
again<00:01:21.810> which<00:01:22.020> to<00:01:22.230> me<00:01:22.410> is<00:01:22.650> that<00:01:22.860> music<00:01:23.490> that

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
again which to me is that music that

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.370 
again which to me is that music that
they're<00:01:23.850> playing<00:01:24.120> but<00:01:24.390> we<00:01:24.510> just<00:01:24.690> can't<00:01:24.990> hear

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
they're playing but we just can't hear

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.320 
they're playing but we just can't hear
so<00:01:26.100> when<00:01:26.220> you<00:01:26.280> start<00:01:26.490> thinking<00:01:26.520> that<00:01:26.910> way

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
so when you start thinking that way

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.660 
so when you start thinking that way
about<00:01:28.200> what<00:01:28.560> are<00:01:28.620> we<00:01:28.680> missing<00:01:28.950> from<00:01:29.520> not

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
about what are we missing from not

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.580 
about what are we missing from not
hearing<00:01:30.030> this<00:01:30.120> music<00:01:30.330> it<00:01:31.020> opens<00:01:31.350> up<00:01:31.470> this

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
hearing this music it opens up this

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.830 
hearing this music it opens up this
whole<00:01:31.650> world<00:01:32.240> for<00:01:33.240> instance<00:01:33.330> there's<00:01:33.630> only

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
whole world for instance there's only

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.400 
whole world for instance there's only
10%<00:01:34.770> of<00:01:35.250> your<00:01:35.970> brain<00:01:36.240> is<00:01:36.510> neurons<00:01:36.930> but

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:37.410 
10% of your brain is neurons but

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:39.620 
10% of your brain is neurons but
everything's<00:01:37.860> taking<00:01:38.220> apart<00:01:38.460> here<00:01:38.760> I<00:01:38.970> have<00:01:39.540> no

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
everything's taking apart here I have no

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.510 
everything's taking apart here I have no
idea<00:01:39.900> what<00:01:40.080> we'll<00:01:40.230> actually<00:01:40.350> find<00:01:41.160> when<00:01:41.430> you

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
idea what we'll actually find when you

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.310 
idea what we'll actually find when you
start<00:01:41.730> listening<00:01:42.000> in<00:01:42.390> on<00:01:42.540> neurotransmission

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
start listening in on neurotransmission

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.620 
start listening in on neurotransmission
we're<00:01:43.620> just<00:01:43.830> starting<00:01:44.250> to<00:01:44.580> get<00:01:44.760> there<00:01:45.060> for

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
we're just starting to get there for

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:46.760 
we're just starting to get there for
anything<00:01:45.840> there's<00:01:45.990> dozens<00:01:46.500> of<00:01:46.650> these

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
anything there's dozens of these

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.470 
anything there's dozens of these
neurotransmitters<00:01:47.700> and<00:01:47.850> you<00:01:47.940> can't<00:01:48.150> really

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:48.480 
neurotransmitters and you can't really

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:50.300 
neurotransmitters and you can't really
get<00:01:48.660> a<00:01:48.720> whole<00:01:49.020> view<00:01:49.440> of<00:01:49.560> what's<00:01:49.770> going<00:01:50.100> on

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
get a whole view of what's going on

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.070 
get a whole view of what's going on
without<00:01:50.640> listening<00:01:51.120> to<00:01:51.330> the<00:01:51.510> whole<00:01:51.659> range<00:01:51.840> of

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:52.080 
without listening to the whole range of

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.649 
without listening to the whole range of
sounds<00:01:52.620> so<00:01:53.190> we're<00:01:53.310> making<00:01:53.430> a<00:01:53.670> suite<00:01:54.270> of<00:01:54.480> these

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
sounds so we're making a suite of these

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.110 
sounds so we're making a suite of these
sensors<00:01:55.530> for<00:01:55.770> neuro<00:01:55.980> transmitters<00:01:56.730> now<00:01:57.000> this

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:57.120 
sensors for neuro transmitters now this

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:58.610 
sensors for neuro transmitters now this
technology<00:01:57.420> goes<00:01:57.750> way<00:01:57.960> beyond<00:01:58.350> what<00:01:58.470> we've

00:01:58.610 --> 00:01:58.620 
technology goes way beyond what we've

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:00.470 
technology goes way beyond what we've
developed<00:01:59.130> for<00:01:59.280> neuron<00:01:59.760> recording<00:02:00.300> but

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:00.480 
developed for neuron recording but

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:02.300 
developed for neuron recording but
there's<00:02:01.350> just<00:02:01.500> no<00:02:01.650> other<00:02:01.680> way<00:02:01.890> of

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
there's just no other way of

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.190 
there's just no other way of
understanding<00:02:02.760> what's<00:02:03.270> going<00:02:03.360> on<00:02:03.750> in<00:02:03.990> there

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
understanding what's going on in there

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.440 
understanding what's going on in there
what<00:02:04.650> makes<00:02:04.800> up<00:02:05.240> sensation<00:02:06.240> and

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
what makes up sensation and

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.359 
what makes up sensation and
consciousness<00:02:07.080> it's<00:02:07.680> all<00:02:07.890> this<00:02:08.069> thing

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
consciousness it's all this thing

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.249 
consciousness it's all this thing
happening<00:02:08.970> in<00:02:09.179> the<00:02:09.509> space<00:02:09.810> between<00:02:10.050> the

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
happening in the space between the

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.590 
happening in the space between the
neurons

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:12.600 
neurons

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.660 
neurons
