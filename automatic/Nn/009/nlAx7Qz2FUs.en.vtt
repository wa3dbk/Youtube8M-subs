00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.180
 ale we are leaving turkey we are in 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:08.910
 cruise with the Verona hunter e 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.740
 cacia as you are finding yourself in these 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.469
 days of cruising, in short, a novelty 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:16.520
 for you yes for me I the first time 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:19.890
 I take a cruise and I'm fine then 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:23.039
 daniele fabrizio we have lived everything 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:27.029
 the year together therefore already forced a 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:28.500
 nice relationship with them so I'm fine though 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:32.309
 I really felt comfortable with them 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:34.710
 here with all the staff with you too 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.899
 those fans because there is a part of the 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:41.100
 fans who are doing well 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:42.960
 because they are not exaggerate they are here 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.030
 when they have to ask for something as it is 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.120
 right that various photos are so true 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.980
 autographs or things you are 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.500
 behaving well so it's great 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.420
 then here is the sun sea and the right 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.399
 relax after a year of fatigue because 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.379
 anyway even if you maybe played 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.420
 in short, he played very little though 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.980
 you were also instrumental in doing 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.899
 group to create this group then 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.500
 in the end it brought a result 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:06.540
 extraordinary that it was the 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.549
 promotion in series to that era 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.830
 the goal we set ourselves to 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:13.140
 beginning of the year that was the series to why 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.299
 however an important team and then 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.030
 really from inside the locker room but 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.650
 having said that I think of a degree 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.509
 immediately because I found some companions 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.009
 that made me integrate right away 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.990
 because anyway if you find companions 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.430
 that do not allow you to allow 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.479
 these are even more difficult I am 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.000
 arrived here in Verona 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:32.549
 the last market day and I found 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.720
 a group of comrades speak on a level 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:38.759
 really incredible human being now 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.619
 easy to say but it will not go into series a 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.840
 was in that group is what happens 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.119
 it was difficult inside the locker room 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.170
 then technically I do n't have to god I think 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.630
 that we've talked about it enough 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.820
 which was a very valid group and therefore 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:54.420
 although it was difficult because the series a 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:56.310
 series b and every game then set off with 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.170
 favors of the prediction even more 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.750
 difficult that every game like a e 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.520
 saw all vinyan olives match of the 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.200
 life shut down so I think that 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.729
 we have been 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.869
 we deserved this result e 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.009
 we were great 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.390
 the course of the season also the 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.879
 manager especially the mister have 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.680
 stressed several times that even those who do not 

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:15.719
 I played who used little 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.040
 he created something important that is 

00:02:15.719 --> 00:02:19.680
 helped to contribute something 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.180
 important for this promotion was 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.519
 perhaps this is also the strength of the group 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.170
 a group united precisely in all its 

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:28.739
 elements 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:32.870
 if he said the manager is the 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:35.150
 truth that is when I do not know made sentences or 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:39.120
 it's just the truth was a group 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:42.239
 extraordinary even those who were not out 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:44.430
 I've never heard complaints play that 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:47.129
 does not play that because it was anyway 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.750
 so difficult because it is anyway 

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:51.419
 difficult to reach that goal 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:55.019
 that there was no time to 

00:02:51.419 --> 00:02:57.359
 stop for those who complained because there is 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:58.709
 the group rowed everything and everyone there 

00:02:57.359 --> 00:03:02.250
 we put everyone back together 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:04.400
 same towards the same goal and we are there 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:07.799
 successful we closed great 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:09.930
 we deserved the series at two o'clock 

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:11.700
 useful to emphasize you have played 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:13.230
 very little in short you sacrificed a 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.040
 a little for this because of this 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:15.659
 this goal 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.549
 what do you expect from this summer 

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:18.989
 especially to the transfer market yours 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:20.669
 will and that way of staying 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:22.049
 verona maybe maybe go play 

00:03:20.669 --> 00:03:23.909
 since it is probably the competition 

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:27.629
 will be even stronger this year in 

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:29.989
 series there is the possibility that the verona 

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:32.729
 redeem me and I would like it 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:34.109
 first on a personal level because not 

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:36.209
 having played even more difficult 

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:37.639
 order however I have also shown 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:40.680
 in training 

00:03:37.639 --> 00:03:42.299
 I hope technically precisely then 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:45.180
 behaviors and attitudes of 

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:45.750
 to deserve to be able to deserve the 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:48.120
 confirmation 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:50.430
 then clearly also being redeemed 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:52.769
 at least 22 years old being anyway 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:55.139
 relatively young I want and 

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:58.620
 need to play for my growth 

00:03:55.139 --> 00:04:00.930
 at the technical level staff I need me 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:02.489
 need to play like bread so I want 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:05.099
 go I want to go out and play 

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:07.409
 but I would like to see Verona anyway 

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:09.840
 redeemed me in these last hours of 

00:04:07.409 --> 00:04:11.370
 cruise, however, must redeem you by ping 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:13.680
 pong because that defeated with 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:15.449
 career does not make you down 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:17.909
 I don't know why, anyway, I'm Fabrizio 

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:20.250
 masia historical couple that in Rome and I love 

00:04:17.909 --> 00:04:22.320
 touched upon success here was so 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:24.190
 easy to win against who it really is 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:26.380
 your brother 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:29.230
 we lost against my brother ha 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:30.850
 incredible shaved but we do it again 

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:32.770
 let's see if we can do tomorrow 

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:34.210
 another game because we play if 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:37.780
 let's play fifteen more times we say 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:40.240
 20 15 I ca n't explain myself not 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:42.430
 we lost anyway we did 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:44.230
 why it is because we have seen it anyway 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:46.090
 immediately just some problems with the most 

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:47.860
 impose then that encourages to 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:49.510
 keep playing we did 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:51.430
 winning was an act in other words 

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:54.270
 we say goodwill 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:59.070
 an act of kindness towards daniele 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:59.070
 he wanted to sing thanks to everyone
