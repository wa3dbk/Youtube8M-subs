stronger and there's more of them so

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:34.010 
stronger and there's more of them so
it's<00:00:32.399> easily<00:00:32.669> to<00:00:32.969> do<00:00:33.059> it<00:00:33.180> on<00:00:33.329> playthrough<00:00:33.840> one

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.010 
if you're like level 20 level 14 if that
maybe<00:00:37.910> there's<00:00:38.910> a<00:00:39.000> point<00:00:39.180> in<00:00:39.210> the<00:00:39.270> storyline<00:00:39.570> -

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
maybe there's a point in the storyline -

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.170 
maybe there's a point in the storyline -
as<00:00:40.379> I<00:00:40.500> have<00:00:40.530> to<00:00:40.739> mention<00:00:40.920> that<00:00:41.100> you<00:00:41.730> have<00:00:41.910> to<00:00:42.059> be

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
by to get into the caverns but yeah I

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.400 
by to get into the caverns but yeah I
don't<00:00:47.789> wanna<00:00:48.000> spoil<00:00:48.180> the<00:00:48.360> story<00:00:48.570> so<00:00:48.809> you'll

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
don't wanna spoil the story so you'll

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.470 
don't wanna spoil the story so you'll
know<00:00:49.590> when<00:00:49.860> and<00:00:50.129> you<00:00:50.160> just<00:00:50.940> head<00:00:51.090> back<00:00:51.120> to

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
know when and you just head back to

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.799 
know when and you just head back to
where<00:00:51.629> that<00:00:51.809> event<00:00:52.440> happens<00:00:52.829> and<00:00:53.239> so<00:00:54.239> you<00:00:54.629> go

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
where that event happens and so you go

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.389 
where that event happens and so you go
here<00:00:55.230> and<00:00:55.440> you<00:00:55.649> jump<00:00:55.890> up<00:00:55.980> here

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
here and you jump up here

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.010 
here and you jump up here
and<00:00:56.520> you<00:00:56.699> go<00:00:56.820> through<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:57.180> yard<00:00:57.360> through

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
and you go through the yard through

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.170 
and you go through the yard through
these<00:00:58.170> blocks<00:00:58.410> right<00:00:58.559> there<00:00:58.770> if<00:00:59.640> you<00:00:59.760> duck<00:01:00.000> you

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
these blocks right there if you duck you

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:01.790 
these blocks right there if you duck you
can<00:01:00.329> only<00:01:00.449> go<00:01:00.629> through<00:01:00.809> one<00:01:01.020> way<00:01:01.170> things<00:01:01.440> and

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
can only go through one way things and

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.500 
can only go through one way things and
then<00:01:01.920> they'll<00:01:02.070> be<00:01:02.219> creepers<00:01:02.969> but<00:01:03.180> since<00:01:03.359> its

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
then they'll be creepers but since its

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:04.759 
then they'll be creepers but since its
own<00:01:03.600> played<00:01:03.840> through<00:01:04.019> to<00:01:04.170> think<00:01:04.619> there's

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
own played through to think there's

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:05.990 
own played through to think there's
eight<00:01:04.890> more<00:01:05.220> there's<00:01:05.549> like<00:01:05.700> two<00:01:05.820> or<00:01:05.939> three

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
eight more there's like two or three

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.899 
eight more there's like two or three
more<00:01:06.270> or<00:01:06.420> something<00:01:06.830> so<00:01:07.830> there<00:01:08.490> you<00:01:08.580> go<00:01:08.700> and

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
more or something so there you go and

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.210 
more or something so there you go and
the<00:01:09.900> giant<00:01:10.439> one<00:01:10.590> should<00:01:10.770> be<00:01:10.830> coming<00:01:11.100> in<00:01:11.159> a

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
the giant one should be coming in a

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.280 
the giant one should be coming in a
second<00:01:11.580> so<00:01:12.479> you<00:01:12.540> see<00:01:12.689> there's<00:01:12.869> a<00:01:12.930> lot<00:01:13.110> more

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
second so you see there's a lot more

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.490 
second so you see there's a lot more
than<00:01:13.530> regularly<00:01:14.360> so<00:01:15.360> there<00:01:15.509> is<00:01:15.689> so<00:01:15.990> amusing

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
than regularly so there is so amusing

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.380 
than regularly so there is so amusing
weak<00:01:16.770> SMG<00:01:17.340> so<00:01:17.670> I<00:01:17.850> probably<00:01:18.030> should<00:01:18.270> have

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
weak SMG so I probably should have

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.359 
weak SMG so I probably should have
switched<00:01:18.450> to<00:01:18.600> something<00:01:18.890> did<00:01:19.890> more<00:01:20.040> damage

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
switched to something did more damage

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.520 
switched to something did more damage
but<00:01:20.580> anyways<00:01:21.420> you<00:01:21.600> killed<00:01:21.810> him<00:01:21.900> and<00:01:22.080> then<00:01:22.380> he

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
but anyways you killed him and then he

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.980 
but anyways you killed him and then he
drops<00:01:22.799> a<00:01:23.009> bunch<00:01:23.220> of<00:01:23.340> things<00:01:23.520> so<00:01:23.939> for<00:01:24.570> example

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
drops a bunch of things so for example

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.510 
drops a bunch of things so for example
there's<00:01:25.140> the<00:01:25.290> crafty<00:01:25.650> head<00:01:25.799> right<00:01:26.009> there<00:01:26.220> so

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
there's the crafty head right there so

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.910 
there's the crafty head right there so
you<00:01:27.090> gotta<00:01:27.240> pick<00:01:27.420> it<00:01:27.509> up<00:01:27.650> sometimes<00:01:28.650> doesn't

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
you gotta pick it up sometimes doesn't

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.969 
you gotta pick it up sometimes doesn't
spawns<00:01:29.159> and<00:01:29.460> there's<00:01:30.030> the<00:01:30.270> skin<00:01:30.630> for<00:01:30.840> you<00:01:30.979> so

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
spawns and there's the skin for you so

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.410 
spawns and there's the skin for you so
sometimes<00:01:32.340> it<00:01:32.460> doesn't<00:01:32.610> spawn<00:01:32.939> so<00:01:33.180> you<00:01:33.270> might

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
sometimes it doesn't spawn so you might

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.960 
sometimes it doesn't spawn so you might
need<00:01:33.540> to<00:01:33.600> have<00:01:33.750> to<00:01:33.869> go<00:01:34.140> back<00:01:34.380> and<00:01:34.770> redo<00:01:35.310> it

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
need to have to go back and redo it

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.789 
need to have to go back and redo it
maybe<00:01:36.329> like<00:01:36.509> two<00:01:36.689> or<00:01:36.720> three<00:01:36.840> times<00:01:37.229> if<00:01:37.530> that's

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
maybe like two or three times if that's

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.350 
maybe like two or three times if that's
like<00:01:37.979> worst<00:01:38.340> case<00:01:38.460> scenario<00:01:38.909> I<00:01:39.000> got<00:01:39.150> the

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
like worst case scenario I got the

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.840 
like worst case scenario I got the
second<00:01:39.689> time<00:01:39.810> on<00:01:40.020> this<00:01:40.140> so<00:01:40.470> it's<00:01:41.340> not<00:01:41.460> that<00:01:41.549> bad

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
second time on this so it's not that bad

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.300 
second time on this so it's not that bad
