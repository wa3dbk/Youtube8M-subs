00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.120
 and hello to all dear friends with you top 

00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:06.100
 dota and today will tell you how 

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:11.860
 way you can build sitting in the carcass 

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:14.170
 feet meters get nothing new flesh 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:16.630
 such a gun act like this 

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:24.039
 we set fire to one dynamite first 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:26.169
 dynamite I almost did it 

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:28.239
 a good example of how it works 

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:32.680
 this gun was already out of the hollow well 

00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:41.710
 get here over stylish so we take a block 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:44.320
 obsidian put here here so here it is 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:47.680
 there will be a floor so that nothing will fail 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:50.490
 we put the floor here a block here we put another 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.490
 obsidian blocks 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:01:09.729
 there must still be a blog like this 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:11.700
 so so we take water up to me here 

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:24.270
 drag here 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:31.109
 inside the block is dynamite and here is dynamite 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:38.670
 rather his children man then this 

00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:38.670
 move away and here's the gun ready will and 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:45.539
 the main thing is that the gun is not disposable 

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:47.200
 let's again about experimenting we 

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:51.700
 we put dynamite 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:52.630
 you dynamite 2 we light 14 second 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:59.609
 light any 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:02:02.770
 and here is our gun ready for him 

00:01:59.609 --> 00:02:04.810
 how does it work that is, let's say 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:08.020
 such guns you can build 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:11.450
 build a series of such guns to prepare them 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:14.170
 and evaluated let's say here 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.170
 mobs and 

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:21.950
 these are all simple arrangements with you 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:24.860
 a bottle of gok 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:27.160
 for new videos to new meetings all 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:27.160
 until
