00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:26.340
 Hi guys if you really are not able to 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:28.980
 accept it we windows 8 interface 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.950
 and you want to disable both the start 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:35.040
 screen that the charm bar to make space 

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:38.550
 to a classic menu jump you can do it 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:42.930
 leaning on programs like metro 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:44.640
 killer and classic star 8 or programs 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.000
 similar 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:50.760
 the first way allows precisely of 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.489
 remove the touch screen 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:58.530
 the corpse bar and therefore the hot corners 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:01:02.510
 that is, the angles that allow you to 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:06.869
 access the Windows interface 8 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:09.330
 while the second installs a menu 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:12.690
 classic start as that of the 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:15.210
 previous operating systems and then from 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:17.360
 use instead of touch 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.360
 screen 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:25.799
 so for the first one it will be enough 

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:28.080
 access the website www.toyg.it m from dal 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:32.189
 html background go to the bottom of the page 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:35.159
 click on download and start the ex e 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:37.979
 just downloaded will then inform you that 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:41.460
 there when you will be disabled on 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:46.640
 screenshot corners let's continue 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:49.110
 we click on it is bent that typical 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.220
 admits interface and interface of 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.110
 windows 8 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.070
 can be quietly 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:56.869
 restorers by starting the computer 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:02:00.960
 or by starting the resource explorer 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:03.570
 in fact the change is not permanent 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:09.750
 going on task management indeed in the 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:11.850
 task manager and restarting explores 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:14.519
 resources will in fact be rehabilitated see 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:17.579
 now feeling and the corners not 

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:19.700
 nothing happens and the explorer starts 

00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:19.700
 resources 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:26.260
 it all comes back as you see back from 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:32.140
 start 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:34.870
 and leave bar ok now let's see 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:38.549
 the classic start menu as is possible 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:40.930
 put it we connect to the site 

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:43.860

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.860
 free download button 

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:50.849
 expect the download to start 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:03:02.349
 is completed and then we execute 

00:02:50.849 --> 00:03:04.750
 the installer we confirm therefore call 

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:12.790
 on the former we accept the terms of the 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:14.230
 license and then click on finish ci 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:16.209
 you are asked whether to add the bar 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:18.310
 of the classical start tools 8 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:24.120
 we confirm to get this other out 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:24.120
 button you see ie the start button 

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:30.459
 in any case we say the classic 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:33.959
 start screen then you have to then 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:36.669
 reuse the m killer program for 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:38.380
 disable it if necessary should 

00:03:36.669 --> 00:03:42.220
 happen to you 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:43.720
 d if the button of the 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:46.330
 of the start menu 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:49.120
 all you have to do is click on the button 

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:51.280
 right on the application bar e 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:55.000
 enable from the menu bar 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:58.270
 classic start 8 tools as you can 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.740
 see is very similar to that of 

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:03.160
 windows seven with the effect of the spa 

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:07.270
 however the terms are in English but 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:09.520
 they work the same way if you want 

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:10.180
 instead try another type of 

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:13.120
 start menu 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:15.640
 you can view ours 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:19.270
 previous video guide through this 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:23.350
 link that presents you another program 

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:25.600
 which adds another kind of menu 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:29.770
 start and in any case similar to that 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:31.420
 which we have just shown and with 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:33.760
