00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 an austrian film whose trailer 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.279
 a bit comes disturbingly 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.210
 expect us in the beginning of July in the 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:07.799
 german cinemas 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:11.480
 and exactly the trailer we look at 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:11.480
 to see I see 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.869
 I 'm looking forward to it again 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.869
 back 

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:31.370
 amon 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:49.660
 all 

00:00:52.560 --> 00:01:01.910
 how is not clear how much starling 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:07.210
 stand on the forest 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:08.750
 it wears you know how much wanted 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:13.010
 because 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:15.440
 about the planter god the lord has 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:20.400
 they counted 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:23.780
 that he does not miss one 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.780
 after the child 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:34.929
 where is his 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.509
 I hope you know what I am 

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:46.220
 disturb my children with this 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:47.720
 Masks it already a scary picture 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:49.640
 the whole time this psycho adhesive 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.289
 musical accompaniment and at some point 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.640
 the children said very artistic and 

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:54.320
 but gray pictures also has pictures 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.640
 do not want to match and then the 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.869
 Do not tell history is like that 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.549
 a game i have to go back and 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:00.439
 say okay, what awaits me here now 

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:01.700
 because I really do not know that 

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:03.229
 the Austrians have already 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.789
 proved a few times with films like that 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:06.229
 white ribbon or in 3 days you are dead 

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:08.420
 that's exactly when it's a bit 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:09.950
 bizarre becomes really good movies 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:11.599
 That's why I'm happy 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:13.580
 and still amused with the 

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:14.720
 Expectations on I see I see the 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:17.600
 the new vision film then 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.830
 expected from 2 July 2015 in 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.630
 the german cinemas bring and the 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:21.950
 story told by lukas and elias 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:23.420
 both are twins living together 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:25.670
 of course now have under one roof 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.720
 twins the common ones a common 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.340
 mother giving me one 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.910
 beauty surgery you are waiting for your 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.560
 return 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:32.030
 but the woman who comes back there 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.349
 somehow maybe not her 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:35.330
 to be native to her country not to 

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:36.860
 not to the favorite song of your children 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:38.360
 she behaves quite differently but what 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:39.950
 is that for a human under your roof 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.660
 and of course they want to, of course 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:42.830
 know exactly what is behind it then 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:44.930
 It gets its very own 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:46.700
 grafing is beautiful that the coach is not 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:48.500
 Too much betrayed we only see it could 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.840
 to get pretty angry and hard 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.489
 I had a film in the otherwise a fsk 16 looking forward 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:54.019
 I look at me but I see how 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:55.190
 I just do not know what I mean 

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:56.239
 expected to understand that after this 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:58.010
 trailer let me in any case 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:59.720
 know the comments I am through 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:01.310
 he likes to put a thumb in it 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:03.260
 This trailer check will be done 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:04.459
 I do not know otherwise that you know 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.560
 it still left around me and 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:08.930
 tomorrow at 15 o'clock, of course, at the latest 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:12.489

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:12.489
