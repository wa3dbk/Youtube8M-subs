00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:42.440

not<00:00:43.440> enough<00:00:43.680> no<00:00:44.309> real<00:00:45.149> berms<00:00:45.390> on<00:00:45.690> this<00:00:45.899> hill

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:46.700

the<00:00:47.700> hit<00:00:48.350> they're<00:00:49.350> too<00:00:49.530> fast

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:50.450 
the hit they're too fast

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:53.650

yeah<00:00:51.450> it's<00:00:52.110> just<00:00:52.230> not<00:00:52.500> worth<00:00:52.739> the<00:00:52.920> climb<00:00:53.190> I

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:53.660
