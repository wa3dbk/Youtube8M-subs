ever before about a year ago I finally
got<00:00:12.990> fed<00:00:13.259> up<00:00:13.440> with<00:00:13.559> killing<00:00:13.889> my<00:00:13.980> plants<00:00:14.460> and<00:00:14.610> I

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
got fed up with killing my plants and I

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.240 
got fed up with killing my plants and I
decided<00:00:15.150> to<00:00:15.330> create<00:00:15.420> a<00:00:15.570> solution<00:00:16.160> through<00:00:17.160> my

decided to create a solution through my
own<00:00:17.369> experiences<00:00:18.060> in<00:00:18.330> a<00:00:18.420> little<00:00:18.630> bit<00:00:18.720> of

research I found out that over and under

research I found out that over and under
watering<00:00:21.119> are<00:00:21.420> the<00:00:21.539> top<00:00:21.750> killers<00:00:22.140> of

my first attempt at a solution wasn't
very<00:00:26.340> pretty<00:00:26.670> but<00:00:27.390> it<00:00:27.480> was<00:00:27.570> enough<00:00:27.840> to<00:00:27.869> pull

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
very pretty but it was enough to pull

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.439 
very pretty but it was enough to pull
together<00:00:28.439> a<00:00:28.650> few<00:00:28.949> friends<00:00:29.220> and<00:00:29.609> start<00:00:30.150> making

together a few friends and start making
a<00:00:30.539> system<00:00:30.960> that<00:00:31.230> would<00:00:31.289> make<00:00:31.500> gardening<00:00:31.740> more

for the past year we've been working
together<00:00:36.329> to<00:00:36.690> create<00:00:36.870> something<00:00:37.260> that<00:00:37.440> would

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
together to create something that would

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.530 
together to create something that would
change<00:00:37.950> the<00:00:38.219> way<00:00:38.370> that<00:00:38.579> people<00:00:38.640> interact<00:00:39.210> with
