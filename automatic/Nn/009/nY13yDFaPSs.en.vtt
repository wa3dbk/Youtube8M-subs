 [Music] 

00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:04.150
 at 

00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:12.539
 hello everyone I doubted stupid I hope 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.679
 that you're fine me that has 

00:00:12.539 --> 00:00:15.779
 perfectly especially today for 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.340
 the episode number 7 of carlos vela se 

00:00:15.779 --> 00:00:19.200
 to lose on the run 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.490
 this bpl team a little weird with 

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:22.590
 a lot of players outside their 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.759
 positions all that so here we are 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.239
 still in division 3 of this team 

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:25.980
 African 

00:00:24.239 --> 00:00:28.259
 we will try to do our best to 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.480
 to go faster in europe because 

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:31.739
 yes the next step 7 in europe 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.480
 so it's up to you to tell me where this is 

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:35.100
 you want me to go I do not know 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.989
 the Netherlands for example we will try 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.629
 to make a nation pretty much 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:43.469
 near friendly good there you've seen from 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:46.530
 superb actions and magnificent of the 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.940
 scene that instils diouf who run into 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.249
 touch directly in goal exit 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.199
 it's superb it's really superb 

00:00:50.249 --> 00:00:53.149
 so yes I said that it would have to 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.219
 you told me in the comments 

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:58.260
 what team would I want to do I 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.339
 do not know the netherlands austria has 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.699
 not finally a nation a little bit 

00:00:59.339 --> 00:01:04.710
 original not a French team is 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.960
 nothing so here you tell me that 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.860
 quietly and I will do that in 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.200
 comments function 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.640
 it will be in europe this time it left 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.880
 leave my sense a little bit in the 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.560
 gameplay 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.320
 a first half a little dull with 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.030
 some occasions like in saïdia 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.830
 oussama said sorry or die I 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.660
 know more who makes a few small 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.060
 some small technical gestures without 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:25.830
 success we pass in the 30th minute here 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.300
 big acceleration of carlos vela who 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.700
 will be alone in front of goal but 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:30.780
 good his right foot know it's not his 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.610
 strong so he tried a shot 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.260
 left foot quite complicated in this 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.280
 angle but have continued to put the 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.660
 pressure look had to here again a 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.520
 time there is all alone in front of the goalkeeper and 

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:41.970
 there his right foot he is really 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.140
 disgusting and suddenly it's 45th 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.430
 he just before the last break 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.950
 opportunity it's cadamuro my defender 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:49.380
 central who tries a good shot is 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.850
 good it is these countries we pass everything from 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.930
 continuation in the second period there it is him 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.220
 who puts the pressure right away the 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.800
 watch a good little sequence of 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:58.050
 passes but I will succeed intervene 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:59.310
 in extremis look with kameni there I 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:01.380
 I'll go out as quickly as I can 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.640
 possible to clear kameni that is 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.040
 still solid on his line the 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.930
 completely disgusting relaunch it's going 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.390
 I succeed recover these parties assedic 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.800
 who has seen going deep 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:11.940
 youssef el arabi el arabi you know 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.470
 that there is not missing that you know they 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.510
 not rent it besides it or not it's 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:18.870
 in opening score in the 49th 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.670
 minute of youssef el arabi the former 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.110
 player of 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:24.080
 two grenades and time too I believe 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.739
 now he's gone to qatar or a 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:25.989
 Arab 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:28.370
 rabhi are empty I know more exactly 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:29.989
 but here we are opening the mark to the 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:32.319
 49th minute he procured a beautiful 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:34.940
 opportunity it was a joke and 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:36.170
 accelerations the bomba I do not arrive 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:37.340
 too much to pick up the ball and with a 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:38.870
 little luck i do not know too much 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:40.790
 how look there I have 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:42.739
 anticipated the scene that recovers the pass 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:43.459
 in depth and speed of assaidi 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:44.989
 make the difference 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:46.550
 he will be alone in front of the goalkeeper 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:48.590
 in addition to jager who gets hurt like a 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:52.130
 fool and that's these sanctions that 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:53.840
 deserves a shalit shop all that guy 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:55.550
 I cut my bootyshake the guy cut me 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.180
 my little check we could even finish 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:58.160
 quietly 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:00.170
 we'll try to say that's who benefits from 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:02.989
 the big dagger wound for for the 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:04.880
 punish quietly 2-0 at the 51st 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:05.989
 minute 56 minutes continued to put 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:07.010
 the pressure and the acv there that is going 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:09.170
 to find alone in front of the goalkeeper what is 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:10.340
 who made laugh he's speeding up and the little one 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:11.959
 ball down to earth that is decidedly 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:14.030
 who worked very well in this match 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:17.000
 Julio Cesar who was not very serene 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:19.730
 on his line and that's 3 0 to the 56th 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.230
 minute carlos vela who is serene 3 0 on 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:22.130
 know we won now we are 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:24.500
 quiet we tried to put 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:25.880
 nice goals and that's what I'm trying to 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:28.640
 every time to make the series look 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:31.340
 who will recover up feint of hitting he 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:33.769
 accelerates with a scoop turn acceleration 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:35.480
 big hit and it hits the post 

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:35.959
 damn it pissed it was 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:38.989
 well tried 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:41.329
 I'm far from being a king of the gesture 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:42.560
 technical so I try but it 

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:43.730
 still pretty basic like what I do 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:46.010
 and there I will take a goal a little 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:47.810
 a bit unlucky on my part a but 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:49.220
 good it happens it's assaidi decidedly 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:51.890
 who is in every shot a it's 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:53.840
 super grabbed in both teams he 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:54.859
 is everywhere to his ideas and so here 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:56.930
 a victory 3 1 

00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:58.310
 so we go to six points I think or 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:00.200
 wait, listen, we'll see that all 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:02.209
 right away so there we come from 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:04.130
 win another match we lost 

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:07.579
 1 during the previous episode he told me 

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:08.720
 looks good and so here's the like 

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:11.870
 I dominated that I still 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:13.970
 well dominated there we were at 9 points he me 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:15.650
 looks good and we will try to go 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:17.840
 win another match that we 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:19.519
 would therefore already ensure the maintenance it is 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:20.930
 not bad but I think we're aiming 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:21.889
 higher than maintaining anyway a 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:23.660
 little respect so buy it 

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:24.530
 against a Brazilian team with 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:27.139
 some players outside of their 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:28.099
 training and all that so we'll see 

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:30.120
 what it can give but it's going very 

00:04:28.099 --> 00:04:32.790
 quickly with wagner love hulk 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:34.080
 robinho or even willy tons so we 

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:35.310
 go see what can be done at the 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.660
 first opportunity is to look at him 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:38.400
 or lipton that recovers and strikes 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:39.449
 luckily my defender was on the 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:41.520
 trajectory because I'm not sure 

00:04:39.449 --> 00:04:43.530
 that kameni would have been very serene about 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:44.820
 this little shit sentence there is the 

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:45.060
 scene cac it's a big foot job 

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:47.370
 left 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:49.530
 saved by his guardian it was well tempted 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:50.699
 it was well tempted there was the idea the 

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:53.400
 corner to see what we can do is 

00:04:50.699 --> 00:04:54.960
 traoré who cares and fight head 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:57.290
 from cadamuro just past 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:59.040
 unfortunately it was well tempted 

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:00.600
 continue to put pressure but there 

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:01.949
 we will recover ball with barrada 

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:03.150
 who will revive for the seine seine 

00:05:01.949 --> 00:05:05.580
 which is a very good day I liked 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:07.139
 and the cei said bah you know they have 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:09.479
 missed that you know what 

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:11.699
 how do you miss health seriously say no 

00:05:09.479 --> 00:05:13.110
 do not you go to the end a moment 

00:05:11.699 --> 00:05:14.340
 respect the players you pass me ah 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:15.960
 good it's not serious we're raising 

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:17.789
 Moments later it's carlos 

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:19.949
 vela that loose the big velocity at this 

00:05:17.789 --> 00:05:21.630
 alone in front of the goalkeeper advances a little 

00:05:19.949 --> 00:05:23.550
 fool advance before hitting 

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:26.669
 oh there there is more respect to his 

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:28.080
 of a kidnapping for baradat baradat for vela 

00:05:26.669 --> 00:05:30.120
 and who will succeed in getting around 

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:32.070
 philippe and luis is here for this path 

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:34.020
 if twice not twice 

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:36.660
 thanks it's in of course if it's 

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:38.610
 in little little respect for them 

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:40.020
 players anyway thank you here is more 

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:43.500
 he types the pose as you know the buy 

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:45.060
 we are handsome kid 1 0 so thanks to 

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:46.289
 carlito vela that speeds up and kim a 

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:48.360
 big shot of the left foot close to the 

00:05:46.289 --> 00:05:49.530
 unstoppable post and the good 

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:51.270
 table recovery that went well 

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:53.820
 beaten assaidi who will do the diff 

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:56.970
 watch the scene that knew in depth 

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:58.139
 for carlito carlito that will be blocked 

00:05:56.970 --> 00:05:59.550
 by defense but careful attention 

00:05:58.139 --> 00:06:01.199
 to him puts pressure we do not let go 

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:02.610
 relax not barrada that accelerates that is 

00:06:01.199 --> 00:06:04.020
 what he does to the people is hungry to strike 

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:05.880
 ok it becomes anything what 

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:07.080
 is happening carlos vela why do you 

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:08.039
 attempts a coiled strike but a 

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:10.080
 big fools hit 

00:06:08.039 --> 00:06:11.940
 oh yeah there's more respect good go 

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:13.500
 the corner tson with this team I 

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:14.669
 not yet well alone corner though no 

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:16.770
 no no it was a feint 

00:06:14.669 --> 00:06:18.599
 it was an end of course and the 

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:21.210
 beautiful sequence and the arabica center alone 

00:06:18.599 --> 00:06:22.919
 facing the cages and he or not yet a 

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:24.810
 you shoot the guardian it's not 

00:06:22.919 --> 00:06:27.389
 very serious all this but good look 

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:28.470
 the beautiful sequence the good one goes that 

00:06:27.389 --> 00:06:30.120
 Sadly 

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:31.260
 I can not conclude it's not over 

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:31.889
 look at their hobby trying to do 

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:34.440
 small move 

00:06:31.889 --> 00:06:36.720
 the disgusting center well saved by his 

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:37.979
 guardian quietly no we push on 

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:39.690
 push one and there i get body one 

00:06:37.979 --> 00:06:40.890
 free kick so I say good we're going 

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:43.110
 give to carlos vela it's perfect for 

00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:43.470
 a left here you never know care 

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:44.760
 I am 

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:47.090
 I am far from a good shooter 

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:47.090
 free kick 

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:51.860
 [Music] 

00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:54.740
 what am I put to free kick this is to 

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:57.229
 just about that my reaction actually I 

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:59.060
 finished a free kick there is only one is offered 

00:06:57.229 --> 00:07:02.449
 and that's what it means in 

00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:04.729
 more rage quit rage than the free-kick 

00:07:02.449 --> 00:07:05.930
 rage quit direct to the whores I was 

00:07:04.729 --> 00:07:06.710
 happy because it's very rare when 

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:08.180
 I put free kicks I am 

00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:10.250
 really a big dung at the free kick 

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:12.020
 but here I really had really 

00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:13.970
 well dominated this first part of 

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:15.620
 match or we are 9 points 

00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:17.780
 now here is the problem comes 

00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:20.000
 ensure the maintenance we will see if we 

00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:21.620
 can fetch why not the 

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.319
 rise during the episode on who knows 

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:25.520
 who is going we will here 

00:07:24.319 --> 00:07:27.889
 quietly I show you the stats 

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:29.270
 and so we end up Thursday for 

00:07:27.889 --> 00:07:33.280
 the next episode of carlos vela se 

00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:33.280
 to lose on the run was like oh
