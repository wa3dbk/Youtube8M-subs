of<00:01:31.439> the<00:01:31.590> yeah<00:01:32.189> Blackwing<00:01:32.579> cards<00:01:34.369> come<00:01:35.369> on

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
of the yeah Blackwing cards come on

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.550 
of the yeah Blackwing cards come on
mathematician<00:01:36.420> or<00:01:36.509> tonight<00:01:36.840> this<00:01:37.200> is<00:01:37.409> the

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
mathematician or tonight this is the

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.499 
mathematician or tonight this is the
main<00:01:37.799> thing<00:01:37.829> I'm<00:01:38.250> hoping<00:01:38.549> for<00:01:38.820> but<00:01:39.119> uh<00:01:39.180> we'll

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
main thing I'm hoping for but uh we'll

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:44.510 
main thing I'm hoping for but uh we'll
see<00:01:42.290> sole<00:01:43.290> charge<00:01:43.320> that's<00:01:44.009> still<00:01:44.130> pretty<00:01:44.280> good

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
see sole charge that's still pretty good

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.740 
see sole charge that's still pretty good
to<00:01:44.640> get<00:01:45.560> and<00:01:46.670> we<00:01:47.670> have<00:01:47.880> another<00:01:48.180> ring<00:01:48.630> Cup

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
to get and we have another ring Cup

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:54.520 
to get and we have another ring Cup
matches<00:01:48.899> once<00:01:49.259> rank-up-magic<00:01:49.530> a<00:01:50.040> quick<00:01:50.340> chaos

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:54.530 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:58.459 

what<00:01:55.530> else<00:01:55.770> we<00:01:55.979> got<00:01:56.130> here<00:01:56.780> so<00:01:57.780> far<00:01:58.020> not<00:01:58.229> really

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
what else we got here so far not really

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.080 
what else we got here so far not really
some<00:01:58.619> of<00:01:58.649> the<00:01:58.770> better<00:01:59.009> seeker<00:01:59.700> air<00:01:59.850> so

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
some of the better seeker air so

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.359 
some of the better seeker air so
hopefully<00:02:00.479> a<00:02:00.829> little<00:02:01.829> bit<00:02:02.009> better<00:02:02.070> there<00:02:02.310> we

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
hopefully a little bit better there we

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:03.709 
hopefully a little bit better there we
go<00:02:02.490> when<00:02:02.729> the<00:02:02.820> focus<00:02:03.090> on<00:02:03.180> for<00:02:03.329> a<00:02:03.360> second

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
go when the focus on for a second

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.590 
go when the focus on for a second
another<00:02:04.170> soul<00:02:04.380> charge<00:02:04.590> and<00:02:05.600> mathematician

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
another soul charge and mathematician

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:07.999 
another soul charge and mathematician
there<00:02:06.869> we<00:02:07.020> go<00:02:07.170> there's<00:02:07.380> one<00:02:07.590> the<00:02:07.680> good<00:02:07.799> ones

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
there we go there's one the good ones

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.190 
there we go there's one the good ones
that<00:02:08.129> are<00:02:08.489> where<00:02:08.729> we<00:02:08.970> are<00:02:09.209> one<00:02:09.390> to<00:02:09.479> get<00:02:09.569> I<00:02:09.629> think
