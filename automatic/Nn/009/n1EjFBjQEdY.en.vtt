competition and dancer you can go to
ballet<00:02:14.500> class<00:02:14.680> and<00:02:15.280> maybe<00:02:15.670> just<00:02:15.910> not<00:02:16.180> put<00:02:16.720> all

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
ballet class and maybe just not put all

forth your effort or something and
that's<00:02:19.000> totally<00:02:19.450> different<00:02:19.599> from<00:02:19.840> like

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:20.740 
that's totally different from like

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:22.860 
that's totally different from like
trying<00:02:21.670> to<00:02:21.700> your<00:02:21.880> leg<00:02:22.030> higher<00:02:22.420> and<00:02:22.660> higher<00:02:22.690> and

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
trying to your leg higher and higher and

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.620 
trying to your leg higher and higher and
higher<00:02:22.959> lots<00:02:23.470> of<00:02:23.590> determination<00:02:24.430> and<00:02:24.700> hard

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
higher lots of determination and hard

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:27.690 
higher lots of determination and hard
work<00:02:25.720> because<00:02:26.410> if<00:02:26.650> you<00:02:26.800> don't<00:02:27.010> come<00:02:27.550> to<00:02:27.580> class

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
work because if you don't come to class

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:31.050 
work because if you don't come to class
and<00:02:27.940> stuff<00:02:28.660> it's<00:02:28.930> really<00:02:29.530> hard<00:02:29.740> to<00:02:30.060> progress

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
and stuff it's really hard to progress

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.330 
and stuff it's really hard to progress
like<00:02:31.630> for<00:02:31.780> example<00:02:31.870> like<00:02:32.260> whenever<00:02:32.440> you<00:02:32.770> do<00:02:33.310> a

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
like for example like whenever you do a

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.730 
like for example like whenever you do a
combination<00:02:33.610> they<00:02:34.000> expect<00:02:34.300> you<00:02:34.480> to<00:02:34.590> catch<00:02:35.590> on

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:35.740 
combination they expect you to catch on

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:37.530 
combination they expect you to catch on
fast<00:02:36.010> you<00:02:36.550> know<00:02:36.670> maybe<00:02:37.030> ask<00:02:37.300> a<00:02:37.420> couple

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
fast you know maybe ask a couple

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.750 
fast you know maybe ask a couple
questions<00:02:37.690> and<00:02:38.530> make<00:02:39.040> sure<00:02:39.069> that<00:02:39.400> you<00:02:39.490> know

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
questions and make sure that you know

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.270

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
our technique because going like this

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:39.710 
our technique because going like this
you<00:03:38.489> know<00:03:38.580> it's<00:03:38.819> not<00:03:39.000> what<00:03:39.239> the<00:03:39.360> audience<00:03:39.450> is
