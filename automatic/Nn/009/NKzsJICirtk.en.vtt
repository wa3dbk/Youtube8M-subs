00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:07.819
 hello everyone with such a classroom just 

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:11.710
 get the logitech of 500 s which is the 

00:00:07.819 --> 00:00:13.670
 new version of the old 500 

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:19.600
 but I have here 

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:19.600
 and well let's see how the mouse is 

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:26.030
 good 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:29.360
 in appearance it has changed although what 

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:32.350
 it's the way it looks like it's exactly 

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:32.350
 same 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:38.040
 we'll see it better when I take it out to see 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:38.040
 with this 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:46.020
 this has to 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:46.020
 Zeal adhesive tape on nothing 

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:49.610
 ages 

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:10.870
 yes I already know that it could be a cutter but 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.870
 we are even talking 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:23.940
 so I have sometimes irrational 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:23.940
 and if the mouse 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:28.890
 if you speak 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:34.770
 so they have made the return 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:34.770
 good 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:37.710
 nothing else 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:43.880
 we are already with the mouse itself 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.880
 why 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:48.420
 3 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:53.630
 now 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:53.630
 complicated 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:06.909
 and 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:16.410
 and that the box with 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:19.010
 with the instructions and positions of 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.010
 support 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:26.310
 closed 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:31.740
 i 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:52.820
 we are going to do the treatment 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:04.300
 through the hole 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:04.300
 and the plastic will be removed 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.700
 have 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:17.260
 they do not perform them so 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:24.140
 why 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:29.300
 Now I have the mouse out of the box 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:29.300
 is that showing it is not given in depth 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:35.310
 it has to three buttons 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:35.310
 for the thumb 

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:40.110
 you have to go the two buttons to go 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:44.250
 changing the sensitivity of the mouse 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:48.240
 when we want the network is where the network 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:51.050
 it decreases from being fixed 

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:51.050
 be loose 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:55.849
 Y 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:04:01.090
 we have appearance that is also what 

00:03:55.849 --> 00:04:05.430
 they have changed more modernito maybe 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:05.430
 and good so then 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:12.770
 this part that is the 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:15.130
 the insert where you can place the 

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:15.130
 pesos 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:22.450
 here I have compared just to the side 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:25.930
 of 500 which is really very similar 

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:29.340
 buttons in a few locations so 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:32.240
 it seems that it has only changed at the level of 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:35.300
 appearance 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:37.009
 and nothing since when I tried it 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:41.139
 I can say more about the 

00:04:37.009 --> 00:04:41.139
 greetings mouse performance
