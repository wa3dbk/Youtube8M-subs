00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:27.909
 Vatican 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:27.909
 no happiness 

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:35.980
 this is what you have to do 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:37.260
 to convey happiness it is necessary 

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:38.860
 to be injured 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:41.810
 and this to stop the bull 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:45.689

 Pieces don't worry so much to do 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.439
 poetry only one thing is needed 

00:01:58.459 --> 00:02:03.479
 you understand and not looking for the novelty 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:04.920
 their life the most beautiful thing there is and 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.679
 separates only one track from it 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:10.319
 position from this thus gives the whole 

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:14.010
 war so get yourself here 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:16.079
 I was lying down like the sky looks 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:18.600

00:02:16.079 --> 00:02:25.310

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:27.370
 east make offer from words 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:31.299
