00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:41.950 
just get another crosshair on screen

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:44.160 
just get another crosshair on screen
without<00:03:42.130> a<00:03:42.310> character<00:03:42.640> being<00:03:43.000> there<00:03:43.300> in<00:03:43.780> a<00:03:43.990> way

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:44.170 
without a character being there in a way

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:46.320 
without a character being there in a way
it's<00:03:44.440> kind<00:03:44.530> of<00:03:44.950> like<00:03:45.010> player<00:03:45.430> 2<00:03:45.730> is<00:03:45.850> playing<00:03:45.880> a

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:46.330 
it's kind of like player 2 is playing a

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:48.540 
it's kind of like player 2 is playing a
light<00:03:46.540> gun<00:03:46.720> game<00:03:46.990> without<00:03:47.500> the<00:03:47.710> worry<00:03:48.010> or<00:03:48.280> fear

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:48.550

light gun game without the worry or fear
of<00:03:48.580> being<00:03:49.000> hit<00:03:49.330> so<00:03:49.570> I<00:03:50.350> suppose<00:03:50.740> you<00:03:50.890> can<00:03:51.040> use

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:51.220 
of being hit so I suppose you can use

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:52.470 
of being hit so I suppose you can use
that<00:03:51.370> to<00:03:51.550> kind<00:03:51.670> of<00:03:51.850> cheat<00:03:52.000> your<00:03:52.180> way<00:03:52.270> through

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:52.480 
that to kind of cheat your way through

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.900 
that to kind of cheat your way through
the<00:03:52.570> game<00:03:52.780> or<00:03:53.020> whatever<00:03:53.220> but<00:03:54.220> it<00:03:54.370> kind<00:03:54.820> of

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:54.910 
the game or whatever but it kind of

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:57.890 
the game or whatever but it kind of
sucks<00:03:55.210> but<00:03:55.740> it's<00:03:56.740> not<00:03:56.980> really<00:03:57.430> a<00:03:57.460> big<00:03:57.820> deal

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
sucks but it's not really a big deal

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.870 
sucks but it's not really a big deal
putting<00:03:58.900> you<00:03:59.350> know<00:03:59.470> that<00:03:59.770> minor<00:04:00.100> gripe<00:04:00.430> aside

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:00.880 
putting you know that minor gripe aside

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:04.710 
putting you know that minor gripe aside
the<00:04:01.600> game<00:04:01.780> itself<00:04:02.140> overall<00:04:02.590> is<00:04:02.950> superb<00:04:03.490> and<00:04:03.760> I

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:04.720 
the game itself overall is superb and I

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:07.460 
the game itself overall is superb and I
believe<00:04:05.350> it's<00:04:05.590> truly<00:04:05.980> an<00:04:06.100> asset<00:04:06.550> to<00:04:06.730> the<00:04:06.880> Wiis

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470 
believe it's truly an asset to the Wiis

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:10.050 
believe it's truly an asset to the Wiis
library<00:04:08.470> of<00:04:08.620> games<00:04:08.800> but<00:04:09.610> again<00:04:09.820> that's<00:04:09.940> just

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:10.060 
library of games but again that's just

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:11.850 
library of games but again that's just
my<00:04:10.300> opinion<00:04:10.390> the<00:04:11.320> game<00:04:11.500> is<00:04:11.680> currently

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:11.860 
my opinion the game is currently

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:14.460 
my opinion the game is currently
exclusive<00:04:12.670> to<00:04:12.790> Japan<00:04:13.150> but<00:04:13.900> it's<00:04:14.260> been

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:14.470 
exclusive to Japan but it's been

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:16.349 
exclusive to Japan but it's been
reported<00:04:14.830> that<00:04:15.040> it's<00:04:15.370> getting<00:04:15.580> a<00:04:15.730> release
