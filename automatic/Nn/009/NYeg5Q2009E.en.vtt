00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
whole process of the curing or how would

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.039 
whole process of the curing or how would
you<00:01:02.910> describe<00:01:03.210> this<00:01:03.449> well<00:01:03.629> the<00:01:03.809> great<00:01:04.019> thing

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
you describe this well the great thing

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.050 
you describe this well the great thing
is<00:01:04.260> it<00:01:04.379> can<00:01:04.470> be<00:01:04.530> used<00:01:04.619> like<00:01:05.040> any<00:01:05.250> other<00:01:05.610> exposed

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
is it can be used like any other exposed

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.719 
is it can be used like any other exposed
aggregates<00:01:06.689> so<00:01:07.229> you<00:01:07.320> just<00:01:07.500> really<00:01:07.680> need<00:01:08.460> it<00:01:08.640> on

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
aggregates so you just really need it on

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.390 
aggregates so you just really need it on
the<00:01:08.850> top<00:01:09.090> of<00:01:09.119> setting<00:01:09.840> concrete<00:01:10.280> and<00:01:11.280> then

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
the top of setting concrete and then

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.310 
the top of setting concrete and then
exposed<00:01:11.850> it<00:01:12.030> as<00:01:12.150> you'd<00:01:12.299> expose<00:01:12.659> any<00:01:12.990> type<00:01:13.290> of

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
exposed it as you'd expose any type of

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.260 
exposed it as you'd expose any type of
glass<00:01:14.070> or<00:01:14.400> any<00:01:14.520> other<00:01:14.670> type<00:01:14.820> of<00:01:14.850> exposed

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
glass or any other type of exposed

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.510 
glass or any other type of exposed
aggregate<00:01:15.479> yes<00:01:16.049> really<00:01:16.799> it<00:01:17.130> could<00:01:17.250> also<00:01:17.400> be

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
aggregate yes really it could also be

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.240 
aggregate yes really it could also be
placed<00:01:17.850> in<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.330> in<00:01:19.049> the<00:01:19.320> clear<00:01:19.650> coat<00:01:19.860> so<00:01:20.189> you

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
placed in the in the clear coat so you

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:21.620 
placed in the in the clear coat so you
can<00:01:20.369> actually<00:01:20.520> put<00:01:20.880> it<00:01:20.970> so<00:01:21.180> the<00:01:21.360> way<00:01:21.479> they'll

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
can actually put it so the way they'll

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.749 
can actually put it so the way they'll
find<00:01:21.900> sand<00:01:22.320> you<00:01:22.680> put<00:01:22.860> it<00:01:22.950> right<00:01:22.979> into<00:01:23.220> a<00:01:23.310> clear

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
find sand you put it right into a clear

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.030 
find sand you put it right into a clear
coat<00:01:24.030> so<00:01:24.360> this<00:01:24.600> is<00:01:24.750> like<00:01:24.930> a<00:01:25.110> luminescent<00:01:25.920> or

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
coat so this is like a luminescent or

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.830 
coat so this is like a luminescent or
phosphorous<00:01:26.729> photoluminescence

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
phosphorous photoluminescence

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.140 
phosphorous photoluminescence
pigment<00:01:28.290> whole<00:01:28.650> luminescent<00:01:29.189> stone<00:01:29.520> and<00:01:29.880> sand

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
pigment whole luminescent stone and sand

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.819 
pigment whole luminescent stone and sand
that<00:01:30.390> we<00:01:30.600> develop<00:01:30.990> you<00:01:31.290> brought<00:01:31.530> along<00:01:31.650> a

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
that we develop you brought along a

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.880 
that we develop you brought along a
couple<00:01:32.130> of<00:01:32.360> pieces<00:01:33.360> they're<00:01:33.780> very<00:01:34.560> very

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
couple of pieces they're very very

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.069 
couple of pieces they're very very
lightweight<00:01:35.579> just<00:01:35.970> looks<00:01:36.150> almost<00:01:36.390> like<00:01:36.600> yeah

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
lightweight just looks almost like yeah

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.770 
lightweight just looks almost like yeah

00:02:02.999 --> 00:02:03.009 
makes an overlay mix that will not

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:05.639 
makes an overlay mix that will not
delaminate<00:02:03.729> from<00:02:03.909> any<00:02:04.090> clean<00:02:04.570> surface<00:02:05.110> you

00:02:05.639 --> 00:02:05.649 
delaminate from any clean surface you

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:07.430 
delaminate from any clean surface you
can<00:02:05.799> put<00:02:05.950> this<00:02:06.070> on<00:02:06.220> wood<00:02:06.549> you<00:02:06.759> can<00:02:06.880> put<00:02:07.030> it<00:02:07.119> on

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:07.440 
can put this on wood you can put it on

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.650 
can put this on wood you can put it on
renown<00:02:08.440> that<00:02:08.769> only<00:02:09.130> on<00:02:09.310> concrete<00:02:09.759> nope<00:02:10.269> and<00:02:10.569> it

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:10.660 
renown that only on concrete nope and it

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:12.330 
renown that only on concrete nope and it
doesn't<00:02:11.019> require<00:02:11.110> any<00:02:11.319> climbing<00:02:11.980> on<00:02:12.099> either

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
doesn't require any climbing on either

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.880 
doesn't require any climbing on either
so<00:02:12.970> you<00:02:13.060> can<00:02:13.209> put<00:02:13.390> this<00:02:13.480> on<00:02:13.630> any<00:02:13.930> clean<00:02:14.349> surface

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
so you can put this on any clean surface

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.339 
so you can put this on any clean surface
from<00:02:15.130> 1/16<00:02:15.730> of<00:02:15.849> an<00:02:15.970> inch<00:02:16.060> which<00:02:16.660> is<00:02:16.780> very<00:02:17.050> thin

00:02:17.339 --> 00:02:17.349 
from 1/16 of an inch which is very thin

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:19.229 
from 1/16 of an inch which is very thin
as<00:02:17.560> you<00:02:17.590> see<00:02:17.860> here<00:02:18.099> on<00:02:18.130> you<00:02:18.610> can<00:02:18.790> spray<00:02:19.209> it

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:19.239 
as you see here on you can spray it

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:23.009 
as you see here on you can spray it
trowel<00:02:19.930> it<00:02:20.319> brush<00:02:21.040> it<00:02:21.069> roll<00:02:21.640> it<00:02:21.670> up<00:02:22.480> to<00:02:22.780> 2

00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:23.019 
trowel it brush it roll it up to 2

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:27.720 
trowel it brush it roll it up to 2
inches<00:02:23.250> in<00:02:24.250> one<00:02:24.959> layer<00:02:26.160> one<00:02:27.160> coating<00:02:27.400> so<00:02:27.640> you

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
inches in one layer one coating so you

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.720 
inches in one layer one coating so you
know<00:02:27.790> it's<00:02:27.940> just<00:02:28.060> depth<00:02:28.420> -<00:02:28.900> that's<00:02:29.739> correct<00:02:30.040> so

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
know it's just depth - that's correct so

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:32.490 
know it's just depth - that's correct so
apparently<00:02:31.390> this<00:02:31.599> is<00:02:31.810> a<00:02:31.840> fairly<00:02:32.140> thick

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
apparently this is a fairly thick

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:33.360 
apparently this is a fairly thick
