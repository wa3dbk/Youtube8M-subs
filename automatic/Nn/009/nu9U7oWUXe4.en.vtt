with<00:00:13.889> some<00:00:14.130> jetpack<00:00:14.610> tips<00:00:14.880> and<00:00:15.000> I've<00:00:15.089> been

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
with some jetpack tips and I've been

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.240 
with some jetpack tips and I've been
using<00:00:15.389> the<00:00:15.570> jetpack<00:00:15.780> a<00:00:16.139> lot<00:00:16.560> since<00:00:16.800> halo<00:00:17.039> 4

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
using the jetpack a lot since halo 4

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.279 
using the jetpack a lot since halo 4
came<00:00:17.430> out<00:00:17.580> and<00:00:17.880> I've<00:00:18.240> come<00:00:18.539> up<00:00:18.690> with<00:00:18.720> a<00:00:18.840> lot<00:00:19.140> of

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
came out and I've come up with a lot of

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.200 
that would have gone bad how to not have
the<00:00:37.170> jetpack<00:00:37.559> now<00:00:38.280> here's<00:00:38.460> another<00:00:38.550> one<00:00:38.790> here

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
the jetpack now here's another one here

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.060 
the jetpack now here's another one here
now<00:00:39.510> I'm<00:00:39.780> going<00:00:40.230> around<00:00:40.440> this<00:00:40.559> corner<00:00:40.829> here

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
boost and I know that they're spawning

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.420 
boost and I know that they're spawning
in<00:00:56.760> by<00:00:57.120> open<00:00:57.719> so<00:00:58.140> I<00:00:58.170> kind<00:00:58.469> of<00:00:58.500> jetpack<00:00:58.890> over<00:00:59.219> and

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
up a little farther and this is what I

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.550 
up a little farther and this is what I
like<00:01:08.909> to<00:01:09.030> call<00:01:09.210> having<00:01:09.630> an<00:01:09.780> even<00:01:10.049> ground<00:01:10.320> with

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
like to call having an even ground with

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.039 
like to call having an even ground with
the<00:01:10.680> jetpack<00:01:10.920> now<00:01:11.580> I'm<00:01:11.790> able<00:01:11.939> to<00:01:12.090> jetpack<00:01:12.630> over

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
the jetpack now I'm able to jetpack over

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.539 
the jetpack now I'm able to jetpack over
here<00:01:13.320> and<00:01:13.470> I'm<00:01:13.740> able<00:01:13.890> to<00:01:14.010> clean<00:01:14.189> up<00:01:14.310> the<00:01:14.400> kill

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
here and I'm able to clean up the kill

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.010 
here and I'm able to clean up the kill
on<00:01:14.580> this<00:01:14.729> guy<00:01:14.880> and<00:01:15.000> unfortunately<00:01:15.509> I<00:01:15.570> do<00:01:15.750> get

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
on this guy and unfortunately I do get

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.630 
on this guy and unfortunately I do get
taken<00:01:16.320> aim<00:01:16.439> but<00:01:16.860> I<00:01:17.040> would<00:01:17.280> not<00:01:17.430> have<00:01:17.520> gotten

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
taken aim but I would not have gotten

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:18.560 
taken aim but I would not have gotten
mad<00:01:17.820> kill<00:01:18.030> otherwise

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
mad kill otherwise

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.240 
mad kill otherwise
now<00:01:18.960> here's<00:01:19.140> another<00:01:19.200> technique<00:01:19.770> you<00:01:19.979> can

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
now here's another technique you can

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:21.890 
now here's another technique you can
actually<00:01:20.400> stand<00:01:21.030> up<00:01:21.119> on<00:01:21.270> these<00:01:21.360> pillars<00:01:21.689> on

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
actually stand up on these pillars on

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.390 
actually stand up on these pillars on
Haven<00:01:22.080> and<00:01:22.320> you're<00:01:22.409> able<00:01:22.530> to<00:01:22.650> rain<00:01:22.890> down<00:01:23.100> tear

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
Haven and you're able to rain down tear

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.950 
Haven and you're able to rain down tear
and<00:01:23.549> then<00:01:23.610> the<00:01:23.729> jetpack<00:01:24.090> is<00:01:24.240> amazing<00:01:24.750> for<00:01:24.900> this

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
and then the jetpack is amazing for this

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.080 
and then the jetpack is amazing for this
now<00:01:25.200> because<00:01:25.799> it's<00:01:25.979> extremely<00:01:26.460> easy<00:01:26.759> to<00:01:26.909> get

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
now because it's extremely easy to get

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.609 
now because it's extremely easy to get
kills<00:01:27.360> and<00:01:27.630> they<00:01:27.930> don't<00:01:28.140> know<00:01:28.290> where<00:01:28.500> the

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
kills and they don't know where the

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.080 
kills and they don't know where the
bullets<00:01:28.890> are<00:01:28.979> coming<00:01:29.009> from<00:01:29.280> so<00:01:29.700> as<00:01:29.820> you<00:01:29.909> see<00:01:30.060> I
