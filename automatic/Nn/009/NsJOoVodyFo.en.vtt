00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.930
 accounts today my wife sandra 

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:06.789
 Rodriguez who is who is in 

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:09.280
 the camera and a server alberto 

00:00:06.789 --> 00:00:11.379
 rodríguez we want to introduce some of 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:14.919
 most recent work we have done 

00:00:11.379 --> 00:00:17.230
 in our workshop salt cartonery art 

00:00:14.919 --> 00:00:20.410
 Mexican with tradition like you 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:23.470
 can see is a piece that we 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:26.800
 represents a skeleton that is 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:30.330
 drawing we can appreciate a pencil of 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:33.550
 drawing in his hand the same as 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:36.790
 a respirator with all the tools 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:40.930
 that an architect requires for his 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:43.430
 work we see here a rule t 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:46.640
 the squads 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:50.940
 even with its numbering 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:53.989
 we see here a transporter in small 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.989
 even the rubber 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:59.660
 thanks to the 21st century led technology 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:02.260
 we can even 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:04.729
 design a light bulb to turn on 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.920
 palate 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:10.010
 then the fantasy to continue the 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:12.640
 fantasy that this skeletal made 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:16.010
 these planes that you can see here 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:18.710
 everything is done in an artisanal way 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:22.100
 the shoes were created one by one 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:24.159
 start from making the shoe plant 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:26.260
 of each of them 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:28.630
 to one that the other 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:32.230
 and he is with hundreds giving him the height 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:34.990
 determined we also see some of this 

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:38.050
 fine work modesty parts in the 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:40.240
 belt that is covered with 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:43.510
 Loops are not drawn or glued 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:45.580
 but it is really elaborated this 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:47.830
 the belt has its buckle can be 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:50.080
 undo and can be buttoned though 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:52.890
 you obviously do not believe it with much 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:56.920
 Be careful the vest is to a certain extent 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:59.350
 flexible this piece is fulfilling the 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:03.640
 specifications that made us who we 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:06.670
 he commissioned it however obviously one would 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:08.440
 puts the special and creative touch such is 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:11.950
 the case of the eyes as you can 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:14.980
 appreciate having some sunflowers has 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:17.740
 some sunflowers because obviously the 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:21.010
 people who work for the benefit of 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:23.050
 all of all human beings which is 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:25.630
 the case of the architects because they are 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:27.640
 creative people that's why their 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:29.860
 eyes is sprouting and the nonetheless that 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:32.950
 is a skeleton are sprouting around 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:36.340
 very colorful sunflowers and good this 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:39.160
 work has great mobility not only 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:43.060
 because what you own can be removed or 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:46.120
 put but because its structure itself is 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:48.310
 a structure in motion is not 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:50.350
 giving the impression of a person who 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:53.590
 is working 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:56.560
 because this is part of what we wanted 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:59.170
 present them today has already 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:01.120
 time we upload videos to youtube 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:03.340
