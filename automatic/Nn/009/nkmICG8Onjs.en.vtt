stainless is that we have today and what

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:24.169 
stainless is that we have today and what
makes<00:00:21.910> each<00:00:22.179> one<00:00:22.240> of<00:00:22.449> those<00:00:22.599> different<00:00:23.050> okay

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:24.179 
makes each one of those different okay

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:26.700 
makes each one of those different okay
all<00:00:25.179> steel<00:00:25.539> kind<00:00:25.839> of<00:00:25.900> started<00:00:26.259> from<00:00:26.289> a<00:00:26.500> plain

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:26.710 
all steel kind of started from a plain

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:28.499 
all steel kind of started from a plain
carbon<00:00:27.009> steel<00:00:27.160> it<00:00:27.609> was<00:00:27.699> the<00:00:27.820> first<00:00:28.000> steel<00:00:28.330> that

00:00:28.499 --> 00:00:28.509 
carbon steel it was the first steel that

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:31.829 
carbon steel it was the first steel that
was<00:00:28.630> made<00:00:29.220> plain<00:00:30.220> carbon<00:00:30.460> steel<00:00:30.839> involves

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:31.839 
was made plain carbon steel involves

00:00:31.839 --> 00:00:37.729 
was made plain carbon steel involves
having<00:00:32.160> mostly<00:00:33.160> iron<00:00:33.750> you<00:00:34.750> know<00:00:35.250> 95%<00:00:36.250> 96%<00:00:37.180> iron

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
having mostly iron you know 95% 96% iron

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.470 
having mostly iron you know 95% 96% iron
a<00:00:38.739> little<00:00:39.219> bit<00:00:39.340> of<00:00:39.430> manganese<00:00:39.879> which<00:00:40.030> is

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:40.480 
a little bit of manganese which is

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:42.600 
a little bit of manganese which is
actually<00:00:40.690> the<00:00:40.989> first<00:00:41.020> cow<00:00:41.559> lowing<00:00:41.829> ingredient

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:42.610 
actually the first cow lowing ingredient

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:45.060 
actually the first cow lowing ingredient
added<00:00:43.360> to<00:00:43.539> any<00:00:43.809> piece<00:00:44.050> of<00:00:44.079> carnival<00:00:44.680> steel<00:00:44.920> as

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:45.070 
added to any piece of carnival steel as

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:48.330 
added to any piece of carnival steel as
manganese<00:00:45.309> and<00:00:45.820> then<00:00:46.600> carbon<00:00:47.110> so<00:00:47.829> plain

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:48.340 
manganese and then carbon so plain

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:50.010 
manganese and then carbon so plain
carbon<00:00:48.640> steels<00:00:49.030> have<00:00:49.300> just<00:00:49.570> those<00:00:49.750> three

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:50.020 
carbon steels have just those three

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:53.490 
carbon steels have just those three
ingredients<00:00:50.199> in<00:00:50.859> them<00:00:51.510> and<00:00:52.510> and<00:00:52.870> that's<00:00:53.260> where

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:53.500 
ingredients in them and and that's where

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:54.660 
ingredients in them and and that's where
he<00:00:53.649> treats<00:00:53.949> started<00:00:54.340> that's<00:00:54.489> where

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:54.670 
he treats started that's where

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:56.790 
he treats started that's where
steelmaking<00:00:55.120> started<00:00:55.600> so<00:00:56.440> they<00:00:56.559> invented

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:56.800 
steelmaking started so they invented

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.840 
steelmaking started so they invented
that<00:00:57.039> first<00:00:57.489> simple<00:00:58.030> piece<00:00:58.269> of<00:00:58.300> carbon<00:00:58.840> steel

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
that first simple piece of carbon steel

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.209 
that first simple piece of carbon steel
well<00:01:00.850> they<00:01:01.030> had<00:01:01.149> these<00:01:01.329> other<00:01:01.510> elements<00:01:02.219> that

00:01:03.209 --> 00:01:03.219 
well they had these other elements that

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:06.570 
well they had these other elements that
we<00:01:03.699> can<00:01:03.850> add<00:01:03.969> to<00:01:04.210> that<00:01:04.530> so<00:01:05.530> as<00:01:05.800> you<00:01:05.860> add

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:06.580 
we can add to that so as you add

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:09.560 
we can add to that so as you add
alloying<00:01:07.450> elements<00:01:08.110> you<00:01:08.619> have<00:01:08.650> to<00:01:08.920> increase

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
alloying elements you have to increase

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.080 
alloying elements you have to increase
the<00:01:10.830> temperature<00:01:11.830> that<00:01:12.100> you<00:01:12.159> heat<00:01:12.460> treat<00:01:12.729> so

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:13.090 
the temperature that you heat treat so

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:18.210 
the temperature that you heat treat so
that's<00:01:13.270> one<00:01:13.540> one<00:01:15.420> aspect<00:01:16.420> of<00:01:17.100> adding<00:01:18.100> elements

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:18.220 
that's one one aspect of adding elements

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:20.429 
that's one one aspect of adding elements
if<00:01:19.210> they<00:01:19.390> have<00:01:19.509> to<00:01:19.630> increase<00:01:19.960> the<00:01:20.020> heat<00:01:20.259> tree

00:01:20.429 --> 00:01:20.439 
if they have to increase the heat tree

00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:22.109 
if they have to increase the heat tree
the<00:01:20.590> more<00:01:20.770> you<00:01:20.890> add<00:01:21.130> into<00:01:21.579> that<00:01:21.610> piece<00:01:22.090> of

00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:22.119 
the more you add into that piece of

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:24.090 
the more you add into that piece of
steel<00:01:22.479> the<00:01:23.079> higher<00:01:23.259> you<00:01:23.290> have<00:01:23.590> to<00:01:23.710> go<00:01:23.860> to<00:01:23.920> get

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:24.100 
steel the higher you have to go to get

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.870 
steel the higher you have to go to get
those<00:01:24.280> ingredients<00:01:24.579> to<00:01:24.970> mix<00:01:25.180> so<00:01:26.579> they<00:01:27.579> threw

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:27.880 
those ingredients to mix so they threw

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:29.819 
those ingredients to mix so they threw
in<00:01:28.030> a<00:01:28.090> little<00:01:28.240> bit<00:01:28.509> of<00:01:28.659> half<00:01:29.200> a<00:01:29.290> percent<00:01:29.740> of

00:01:29.819 --> 00:01:29.829 
in a little bit of half a percent of

00:01:29.829 --> 00:01:31.499 
in a little bit of half a percent of
tungsten<00:01:30.130> and<00:01:30.430> a<00:01:30.520> half<00:01:30.729> a<00:01:30.850> percent<00:01:31.210> of<00:01:31.270> Molly

00:01:31.499 --> 00:01:31.509 
tungsten and a half a percent of Molly

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:34.590 
tungsten and a half a percent of Molly
so<00:01:32.049> just<00:01:32.320> very<00:01:32.380> small<00:01:32.649> percentages<00:01:33.600> changed

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:34.600 
so just very small percentages changed

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:39.870 
so just very small percentages changed
10<00:01:35.049> 8<00:01:35.200> or<00:01:35.380> 10<00:01:35.740> 95<00:01:36.130> in<00:01:36.369> 201<00:01:36.850> okay<00:01:37.649> that<00:01:38.649> that<00:01:38.880> one

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:39.880 
10 8 or 10 95 in 201 okay that that one

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:42.569 
10 8 or 10 95 in 201 okay that that one
percent<00:01:40.390> of<00:01:40.570> extra<00:01:41.020> alloyed<00:01:41.470> point<00:01:42.340> five

00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:42.579 
percent of extra alloyed point five

00:01:42.579 --> 00:01:45.359 
percent of extra alloyed point five
Molly<00:01:43.119> and<00:01:43.270> point<00:01:43.780> five<00:01:44.020> tungsten<00:01:44.530> added<00:01:45.340> a

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:45.369 
Molly and point five tungsten added a

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:47.280 
Molly and point five tungsten added a
little<00:01:45.579> bit<00:01:45.700> of<00:01:45.820> toughness<00:01:46.090> and<00:01:46.420> added<00:01:47.200> a

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:47.290 
little bit of toughness and added a

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:49.440 
little bit of toughness and added a
quite<00:01:47.710> a<00:01:47.740> bit<00:01:47.920> of<00:01:48.009> wearability<00:01:48.460> so<00:01:49.149> that's<00:01:49.329> why

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:49.450 
quite a bit of wearability so that's why

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:51.510 
quite a bit of wearability so that's why
oh<00:01:49.630> one<00:01:49.930> is<00:01:49.960> such<00:01:50.229> a<00:01:50.259> great<00:01:50.500> edge<00:01:50.829> hoarder<00:01:51.250> as

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:51.520 
oh one is such a great edge hoarder as

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.429 
oh one is such a great edge hoarder as
far<00:01:51.790> as<00:01:51.820> the<00:01:52.000> carbon<00:01:52.329> Steel's<00:01:52.540> go

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:53.439 
far as the carbon Steel's go

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:58.630 
far as the carbon Steel's go
basically<00:01:55.030> there's<00:01:56.030> about<00:01:56.979> eight<00:01:57.979> to<00:01:58.369> ten

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640 
basically there's about eight to ten

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.990 
basically there's about eight to ten
major<00:01:59.390> alloying<00:02:00.200> elements<00:02:00.770> and<00:02:00.950> as<00:02:01.310> you<00:02:01.759> add

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:02.000 
major alloying elements and as you add

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.020 
major alloying elements and as you add
those<00:02:02.360> alloying<00:02:02.840> elements<00:02:03.439> you<00:02:04.070> increase<00:02:04.820> the

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.030 
those alloying elements you increase the

some<00:04:21.880> toughness<00:04:22.150> and<00:04:22.449> some<00:04:22.600> harden<00:04:22.870> ability

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 
some toughness and some harden ability

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:26.879 
some toughness and some harden ability
so<00:04:24.280> basically<00:04:25.000> that's<00:04:25.180> how<00:04:25.330> it<00:04:25.510> works<00:04:25.889> plain

00:04:26.879 --> 00:04:26.889 
so basically that's how it works plain

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:28.860 
so basically that's how it works plain
carbon<00:04:27.160> steels<00:04:27.490> at<00:04:27.699> one<00:04:27.880> end<00:04:28.030> of<00:04:28.210> the<00:04:28.630> spectrum

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:28.870 
carbon steels at one end of the spectrum

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:32.670 
carbon steels at one end of the spectrum
as<00:04:29.410> you<00:04:30.010> add<00:04:30.280> alloy<00:04:30.789> you're<00:04:31.780> going<00:04:32.020> to<00:04:32.260> add

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:32.680 
as you add alloy you're going to add

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:35.189 
as you add alloy you're going to add
complexity<00:04:33.580> to<00:04:33.880> the<00:04:33.970> steel<00:04:34.270> complexity<00:04:35.050> to

00:04:35.189 --> 00:04:35.199 
complexity to the steel complexity to

00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:37.110 
complexity to the steel complexity to
the<00:04:35.289> heat<00:04:35.470> treat<00:04:35.770> and<00:04:36.490> you're<00:04:36.669> going<00:04:36.849> to<00:04:36.910> also

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:37.120 
the heat treat and you're going to also

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:39.360 
the heat treat and you're going to also
add<00:04:37.539> those<00:04:37.780> properties<00:04:38.349> of<00:04:38.500> those<00:04:38.650> alloys<00:04:39.160> and

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:39.370 
add those properties of those alloys and

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:42.960 
add those properties of those alloys and
bring<00:04:39.669> rule<00:04:40.090> will<00:04:40.330> it<00:04:40.449> take<00:04:40.660> so<00:04:41.789> you<00:04:42.789> know<00:04:42.880> at

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:42.970 
bring rule will it take so you know at

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:44.939 
bring rule will it take so you know at

that's<00:05:10.289> basically<00:05:10.949> how<00:05:11.099> you<00:05:11.699> know<00:05:11.789> all<00:05:11.970> steals

00:05:12.399 --> 00:05:12.409 
that's basically how you know all steals

00:05:12.409 --> 00:05:15.290 
that's basically how you know all steals
came<00:05:13.409> from<00:05:13.680> that<00:05:13.919> original<00:05:14.250> plain<00:05:14.849> carbon

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:15.300 
came from that original plain carbon

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:17.240 
came from that original plain carbon
steel<00:05:15.479> so<00:05:16.110> you're<00:05:16.259> still<00:05:16.560> starting<00:05:17.039> with<00:05:17.220> that

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:17.250 
steel so you're still starting with that

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:20.059 
steel so you're still starting with that
no<00:05:18.120> matter<00:05:18.360> what<00:05:18.720> steel<00:05:19.110> you<00:05:19.289> make<00:05:19.560> your<00:05:19.800> still

00:05:20.059 --> 00:05:20.069 
no matter what steel you make your still

00:05:20.069 --> 00:05:21.490 
no matter what steel you make your still
starting<00:05:20.460> with<00:05:20.610> that<00:05:20.639> plain<00:05:21.030> carbon<00:05:21.330> steel

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:21.500 
starting with that plain carbon steel

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:25.159 
starting with that plain carbon steel
and<00:05:22.500> throwing<00:05:22.949> different<00:05:22.979> ingredients<00:05:23.789> in<00:05:24.169> to

00:05:25.159 --> 00:05:25.169 
and throwing different ingredients in to

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:27.350 
and throwing different ingredients in to
get<00:05:25.289> the<00:05:25.560> properties<00:05:26.250> of<00:05:26.280> your<00:05:26.460> level<00:05:26.699> so<00:05:27.210> the

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:27.360 
get the properties of your level so the

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:29.480 
get the properties of your level so the
steel<00:05:27.599> up<00:05:28.229> to<00:05:28.500> the<00:05:28.620> knife<00:05:28.800> maker<00:05:29.039> there<00:05:29.310> is<00:05:29.430> a
