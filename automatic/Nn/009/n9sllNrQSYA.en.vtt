 we wait a little 

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:06.580
 and it would come to them here 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:10.570
 giving that team of lime is to stand 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:12.370
 users will leave a folder that 

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:14.230
 it's called spider-man ladies that I do not 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:18.120
 it appears because I passed it to the desk 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:21.850
 excuse me here is this and once 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:24.880
 had already downloaded this only 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:28.360
 all they have to do is open the 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:31.840
 folder and open this beautiful symbol and 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:33.490
 you can start playing the controls 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.920
 that they do have a question about how they can 

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:39.880
 I will leave them in the description 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:42.460

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:47.050
 cobweb et cetera etcetera and good this 

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:49.290
 game what I liked is that they do not exist 

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:52.300
 facilities by saying so a portable 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:54.310
 and well this just open it to this 

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:56.080
 place to a gameplay that I wait 10 months 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:59.470
 and it is that it does not give me eggs I leave a 

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:01.720
 gameplay is in English but I think not 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:03.640
 there is in Spanish it exists but good and so 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:05.760
 is how they download what would be 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:08.340

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:10.739

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:25.529
 same folder they open and it's over 

00:04:23.849 --> 00:04:26.969
