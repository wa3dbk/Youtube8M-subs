00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.790
 Well, let's see how coffee is made in 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:09.610
 our machine is on our southern 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:13.719
 coffee maker hata 2014 

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:16.299
 and the little machine to get and I'm going to 

00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:18.509
 teach how it is the first thing to turn on 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:18.509
 machine 

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:24.190
 and have if I was one day you would have to 

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:27.930
 turn green as you know 

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:29.640
 preheated by does not turn on 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:33.410
 The first thing we do is verify that 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.410
 the machine is well closed 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.780
 the machine right now is well going 

00:00:42.679 --> 00:00:49.660
 for nothing here we have two discs 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:53.590
 they came with what the machine was 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:56.420
 we have this album that is the cream that 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:58.879
 has the center has a little hole 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:00.410
 and another part here puts so are a 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:03.290
 significant has to put the part of 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:09.200
 below what is the case 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:09.200
 it is very important that yes no 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:15.190
 for we take what is the case 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:17.530
 is this 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:20.460
 the filter and we put it 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:20.460
 we try to enter 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.369
 30 hours 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.590
 we are approved has 3 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:36.770
 responded and adjusted to between well 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.770
 what 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:43.100
 let's see this with one hand is 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:45.140
 complicated by god 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:48.290
 and now we turn it a little bit so that 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:53.259
 when we leave we take the case with the 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:53.259
 throws us not come with those 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:58.899
 now if we throw we use monodose 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:01.869
 we have this accessory, this is 

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:05.740
 very important because if not the single dose 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:07.600
 will come waters because because the ammunition 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:10.149
 inside this 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.560
 if they use the hard one as it goes inside 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:13.390
 our rule nothing more to put in your 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.510
 site if you use the soft you have to 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:18.280
 put it in and at the same time press it and 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.690
 then put this accessory on top 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.420
 as it is right now in this 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:24.930
 position 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:26.790
 has a highlight here that is like a 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:30.680
 step on that step has to go for 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:30.680
 down that will press the coin 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:35.660
 9 years ago logically 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:39.440
 let's collaborate 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.240
 best 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:43.900
 and this is what with one hand is 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:43.900
 complicated 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:51.080
 now I go out showing we will take the 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:53.920
 accessory the step down 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.920
 and we raise it 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:59.760
 Now I'll have to release the phone because 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:02.930
 this machine apparently the arm has 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:05.689
 quite hard 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:07.989
 you have to hold the machine to put the 

00:03:05.689 --> 00:03:07.989
 arm 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:21.560
 Now we introduce the glass but I have already 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:22.850
 done a test before by is observed 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:25.580
 A) Yes 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:28.030
 numbers with the are 

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:31.390
 and now we give 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:33.040
 to the cream imagine I do not know why it is not 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:35.790
 by the force of the pump if you do not 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.790
 we take the hole 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:41.230
 He gets a lot out of them but with 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:43.410
 a lot of cream since it is a very 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:43.410
 short 

00:03:55.569 --> 00:04:01.620
 I did not realize it's cream 

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:02.930
 I have had to do almost one 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:08.349
 hour 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:08.349
 put and in the cream layer is not given 

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:13.080
 I used there is a torrefacto bag 

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:16.600
 who likes my hand 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:18.780
 it takes one time fear but 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:20.830
 in half an hour as a pendant to good 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:24.300
 that I use it more than anything for that 

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:24.300
 to go to the room 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:35.690
 and I like the long one and that I will not leave 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:35.690
 A) Yes 

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:42.970
 until this date 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:46.889
 let's see well 

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:49.520
 6 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:55.190
 where the bonus 

00:04:52.819 --> 00:04:57.490
 Awesome 

00:04:55.190 --> 00:05:01.210
 ah 

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:02.740
 but you're pretty much how this topic goes 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:05.249
 sometimes throws a little water 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:07.259
 when it ends now 

00:05:05.249 --> 00:05:09.929
 have come to the green light and when 

00:05:07.259 --> 00:05:10.949
 that's how to boil is because the 

00:05:09.929 --> 00:05:13.199
 light green and clear 

00:05:10.949 --> 00:05:16.630
 it heats up more like it 's logical then 

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:20.440
 but a little noise but they are like that 

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:25.740
 but that has not been useful and then 

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:25.740
 when I now hang it on youtube
