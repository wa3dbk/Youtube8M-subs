there's this little jet and

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.050 
there's this little jet and
right<00:03:00.750> here<00:03:01.110> there's<00:03:01.680> an<00:03:01.950> a<00:03:02.159> cloud<00:03:02.459> coming<00:03:02.940> out

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
right here there's an a cloud coming out

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.350 
right here there's an a cloud coming out
and<00:03:03.330> it<00:03:03.900> it's<00:03:04.319> a<00:03:04.470> cloud<00:03:04.680> that's<00:03:05.209> obviously<00:03:06.209> you

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
and it it's a cloud that's obviously you

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.780 
and it it's a cloud that's obviously you
can<00:03:06.599> see<00:03:06.870> safe<00:03:07.110> dimension<00:03:07.680> it<00:03:07.769> and<00:03:08.489> it<00:03:08.670> would

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
can see safe dimension it and it would

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.600 
can see safe dimension it and it would
be<00:03:08.970> it's<00:03:09.209> a<00:03:09.420> filled<00:03:10.379> with<00:03:10.560> active<00:03:10.980> vines<00:03:11.190> and

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 
be it's a filled with active vines and

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:15.110 
be it's a filled with active vines and
these<00:03:11.879> ions<00:03:12.409> actually<00:03:13.409> cover<00:03:14.069> the<00:03:14.280> hair<00:03:14.580> while

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
these ions actually cover the hair while

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.479 
these ions actually cover the hair while
you're<00:03:15.390> brushing<00:03:15.569> it<00:03:15.930> and<00:03:16.200> literally<00:03:17.040> layer

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
you're brushing it and literally layer

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:19.550 
you're brushing it and literally layer
massive<00:03:18.030> cloud<00:03:18.209> over<00:03:18.690> it<00:03:18.750> and<00:03:19.110> therefore<00:03:19.319> they

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
massive cloud over it and therefore they

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.710 
massive cloud over it and therefore they
have<00:03:19.709> it<00:03:19.829> comes<00:03:20.010> a<00:03:20.129> lot<00:03:20.280> smoother<00:03:20.790> shinier

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
have it comes a lot smoother shinier

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.680 
have it comes a lot smoother shinier
