00:00:04.249 --> 00:00:04.259 
with cash University and I'm here with

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:06.440 
with cash University and I'm here with
the<00:00:04.440> seagate<00:00:04.950> freeagent<00:00:04.980> Gulf<00:00:05.790> less<00:00:06.060> desk

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:06.450 
the seagate freeagent Gulf less desk

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.790 
the seagate freeagent Gulf less desk
this<00:00:07.230> is<00:00:07.470> the<00:00:07.649> USB<00:00:08.280> 3.0<00:00:08.880> 3<00:00:09.360> terabyte<00:00:09.389> model<00:00:10.260> now

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
this is the USB 3.0 3 terabyte model now

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.709 
this is the USB 3.0 3 terabyte model now
the<00:00:11.219> best<00:00:11.460> part<00:00:11.700> about<00:00:11.790> Seagate's<00:00:12.480> go<00:00:13.170> flex

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:14.719 
the best part about Seagate's go flex

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:17.420 
the best part about Seagate's go flex
modular<00:00:15.719> design<00:00:16.109> is<00:00:16.350> that<00:00:16.529> this<00:00:17.070> right<00:00:17.369> here

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
modular design is that this right here

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.269 
modular design is that this right here
is<00:00:17.760> by<00:00:18.240> itself<00:00:18.720> and<00:00:19.410> this<00:00:19.680> bottom<00:00:20.070> part

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
is by itself and this bottom part

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.960 
is by itself and this bottom part
actually<00:00:20.609> detaches<00:00:21.449> and<00:00:21.600> you<00:00:22.230> can<00:00:22.410> actually

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:22.970 
actually detaches and you can actually

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:25.790 
actually detaches and you can actually
drop<00:00:23.970> it<00:00:24.180> into<00:00:24.480> another<00:00:24.630> docking<00:00:25.410> station

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
drop it into another docking station

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:32.510 
drop it into another docking station
that<00:00:26.430> can<00:00:26.699> be<00:00:26.910> for<00:00:28.519> firewire<00:00:29.990> eSATA<00:00:31.520> things

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
that can be for firewire eSATA things

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.490 
that can be for firewire eSATA things
like<00:00:32.700> that<00:00:32.940> so<00:00:33.540> you<00:00:33.570> have<00:00:33.870> the<00:00:34.050> functionality

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
like that so you have the functionality

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.510 
like that so you have the functionality
of<00:00:34.920> connecting<00:00:35.430> it<00:00:35.489> to<00:00:35.670> different<00:00:36.440> computers

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:37.520 
of connecting it to different computers

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:41.690 
of connecting it to different computers
different<00:00:38.840> data<00:00:39.840> speeds<00:00:40.200> so<00:00:41.070> it<00:00:41.309> really<00:00:41.520> works

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
different data speeds so it really works

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.410 
different data speeds so it really works
out<00:00:41.879> especially<00:00:42.120> for<00:00:42.420> Mac<00:00:42.780> users<00:00:42.860> who<00:00:43.860> are

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:44.420 
out especially for Mac users who are

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:46.970 
out especially for Mac users who are
looking<00:00:45.420> for<00:00:45.629> that<00:00:45.690> firewire<00:00:46.260> connectivity

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
looking for that firewire connectivity

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.139 
looking for that firewire connectivity
now<00:00:47.610> I<00:00:47.640> did<00:00:47.910> get<00:00:48.090> the<00:00:48.210> USB<00:00:48.780> 3.0<00:00:49.200> model<00:00:49.579> so<00:00:50.579> if

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
now I did get the USB 3.0 model so if

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.380 
now I did get the USB 3.0 model so if
you<00:00:51.239> look<00:00:51.420> in<00:00:51.539> the<00:00:51.629> back<00:00:53.030> we<00:00:54.030> actually<00:00:54.120> have
