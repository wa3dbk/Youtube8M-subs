00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:06.990
 its interface is now many years 

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:10.950
 somehow yes because that he won his first grand prize 

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:15.009
 gentlemen grand prix canada 2010 it was a grand prize yes it was necessary 

00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:18.859
 not treated exactly like being one day sewing 

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:22.429
 the big prices you have to attack hamilton does not always respond 

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:24.249
 he answered present and future 

00:00:24.249 --> 00:00:28.880
 belga la sauvette are real progress of the red single-seater circuit 

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:32.470
 coin purse 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:35.059
 m same for the single-seater but cannon om 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:38.789
 from this beginning of the season there is the circuit especially that allowed me 

00:00:38.789 --> 00:00:41.839
 for two reasons first because now we can very well 

00:00:41.839 --> 00:00:44.799
 exploit the tires that's the first thing the second thing with 

00:00:44.799 --> 00:00:48.980
 youssoupha the system eve two acts that gives them a little more speed of 

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:50.910
 point in the straight line gold 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:51.899
 a good trip 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.359
 just before hanging there is a straight line that does but the five meters 

00:00:55.359 --> 00:00:56.840
 aplon so a good kilometer 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:59.520
 and there they used it and it helped us a lot 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.820
 a performance in lyon seems slight withdrawal your feeling today 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.190
 I do not think that his withdrawal of performance I think it's 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:09.390
 exploitation of the mine which is in withdrawal 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.200
 red bull was a little lost 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.610
 out of 10 on tires a little lost in strategy like that and always and 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.659
 then I will not forget the reliability because if I was she had to lift her foot 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.829
 at the end of the grand prix it's because his gearbox is in the process of 

00:01:21.829 --> 00:01:22.730
 To die 

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:25.780
 and if you're last not gone ahead on the starting line 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.120
 it's because his gearbox was dead and he needs the 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:32.000
 change and so five penalty places on the grid 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.290
 to your votes beating including the system a sequel to the pilot rankings 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:36.940
 and frustrated teams 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:39.469
 he's frustrated he's not angry 

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:42.419
 he's angry about Turkey's biggest price ever the same because 

00:01:42.419 --> 00:01:47.840
 the collision there is an accident with paul bert is struggling to pass alas he had to 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.439
 to make a good performance unfortunately could not make the bet that the valve 

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:52.170
 the attempted 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.300
 namely soft tires subject very quickly 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:58.930
 we will qualify more hard to hold all the start of the race it has not 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:00.210
 not really market either 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.520
 and finally the stable friends the hard tires 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.740
 - the soft tires is it 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.330
 for palestine basket is the one that was also not published either 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.639
 in this case it takes four to five while I could have talked about them 

00:02:11.639 --> 00:02:12.859
 sand alonzo 

00:02:12.859 --> 00:02:14.969
 and revive what you think 

00:02:14.969 --> 00:02:18.629
 as the Spanish driver could do more better - 

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:23.199
 yes of course he was bothered by the traffic fernando alonso but I must say 

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:24.509
 that it's for everyone the same 

00:02:24.509 --> 00:02:28.189
 he had traffic everywhere especially on this grand prix and there was a train 

00:02:28.189 --> 00:02:31.189
 of hell led by both mclaren and alonso ferrari 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:33.100
 it is also planned 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:36.109
 and I'll see if and of course it embarrassed me a bit 

00:02:36.109 --> 00:02:38.380
 but be it a race like that 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:40.649
 he had a car with a good engine 

00:02:40.649 --> 00:02:43.709
 to make him suffer a little bit duplicate frequently that's what he 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:47.559
 had they pulled out of the game now I think ferrari you 

00:02:47.559 --> 00:02:51.839
 do not apologize to another chapter the record label with a new 

00:02:51.839 --> 00:02:55.279
 version b which will probably appear in valence so we will see the network 

00:02:55.279 --> 00:02:57.290
 able to defend differently his chances 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:01.559
 to that the question reminded eventually we did not really shine in canada 

00:03:01.559 --> 00:03:05.099
 he even caused quite a lot of media he was not punished the packers 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:07.429
 that's why 

00:03:07.429 --> 00:03:11.119
 yes and then massa was sanctioned but for excessive speed in the 

00:03:11.119 --> 00:03:11.550
 stands 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:14.650
 when I answer that it is already that did not shine all that is true 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:17.980
 the second thing is that there was not very nice with massa which is his 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:19.699
 best friend he calls his brother 

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:22.960
 and they killed themselves the lapd and the other in the grass 

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:26.130
 for me it was not well played I think it's a chance the page 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:27.309
 Custom 

00:03:27.309 --> 00:03:29.239
 his mother and a little while 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:31.659
 what happened to this list 

00:03:31.659 --> 00:03:36.829
 edgar allan poe johnstone they relied on% 2008 we did not come to 

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:40.399
 canada in 2009 in 2008 there are players call soft and hard tires 

00:03:40.399 --> 00:03:41.879
 so everything has changed 

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:45.379
 so nice to say that she is chosen in the range of hard words hard and in 

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:47.129
 the range of times it is rather rare 

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:48.949
 all of a sudden they were worried 

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:51.910
 and the stables had refused a small 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:55.580
 a little slogan of the day our attention the manufacturer of 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:56.289
 scroungers 

00:03:56.289 --> 00:03:57.669
 therefore bad effect 

00:03:57.669 --> 00:04:00.669
 that's what happened to bridgestone an error of appreciation 

00:04:01.339 --> 00:04:04.889
 if a circuit change was not really planned in the program but 

00:04:04.889 --> 00:04:07.869
 that's the rule but everyone is careful not finally seen 

00:04:07.869 --> 00:04:10.839
 little damage on the tires except that it brought us a race 

00:04:10.839 --> 00:04:12.290
 absolutely sensational 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:14.590
 when you read from all sides like that and just over a year
