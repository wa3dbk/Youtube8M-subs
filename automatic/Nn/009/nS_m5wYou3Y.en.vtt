garchomps do not run a lot of speed EV

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:46.780 
garchomps do not run a lot of speed EV
so<00:02:45.170> he<00:02:45.290> can<00:02:45.440> easily<00:02:45.860> out<00:02:45.950> speed<00:02:46.220> me<00:02:46.370> so<00:02:46.550> that's

so he can easily out speed me so that's

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:48.760 
so he can easily out speed me so that's
why<00:02:47.000> he's<00:02:47.480> gonna<00:02:47.660> make<00:02:47.870> a<00:02:47.930> double<00:02:48.200> switch<00:02:48.320> into

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:48.770 
why he's gonna make a double switch into

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:50.500 
why he's gonna make a double switch into
his<00:02:48.860> car<00:02:49.040> over<00:02:49.160> so<00:02:49.459> that<00:02:49.490> he<00:02:49.850> can<00:02:50.000> freely<00:02:50.240> may
