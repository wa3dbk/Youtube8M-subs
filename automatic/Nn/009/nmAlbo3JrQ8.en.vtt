00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
previous may change but there will be

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.660 
previous may change but there will be

legendary from a ultimate badass

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.560 
legendary from a ultimate badass
structure<00:00:54.180> but<00:00:54.559> people<00:00:55.559> from<00:00:55.800> EOS<00:00:56.129> or<00:00:56.570> eclipse

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
structure but people from EOS or eclipse

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.180 
structure but people from EOS or eclipse
or<00:00:57.840> a<00:00:58.670> random<00:00:59.670> glitch<00:01:00.090> enemy<00:01:00.480> there<00:01:01.440> is<00:01:01.590> no<00:01:01.980> way

or a random glitch enemy there is no way

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.910 
or a random glitch enemy there is no way
I<00:01:02.520> think<00:01:02.640> that<00:01:03.210> this<00:01:03.840> visionary<00:01:04.350> has<00:01:04.589> a

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
I think that this visionary has a

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.770 
I think that this visionary has a
original<00:01:05.700> place<00:01:05.939> where<00:01:06.180> drops

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
original place where drops

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.530 
original place where drops
the<00:01:07.560> legendary<00:01:08.010> there's<00:01:08.400> no<00:01:08.580> boss<00:01:08.820> across

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
the legendary there's no boss across

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:10.720 
the legendary there's no boss across
this<00:01:09.750> region<00:01:09.990> area

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:10.730 
this region area

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:15.420 
this region area
like<00:01:10.880> as<00:01:11.240> a<00:01:11.890> official<00:01:12.890> drop<00:01:13.370> I<00:01:13.700> guess<00:01:14.260> so

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:15.430 
like as a official drop I guess so

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:18.310 
like as a official drop I guess so
there's<00:01:16.430> no<00:01:16.670> way<00:01:16.850> I<00:01:16.880> can<00:01:17.000> tell<00:01:17.300> you<00:01:17.540> on<00:01:17.900> how<00:01:18.290> you

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:18.320 
there's no way I can tell you on how you

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:21.610 
there's no way I can tell you on how you
can<00:01:18.910> get<00:01:19.910> this<00:01:20.120> gun<00:01:20.420> certainly<00:01:21.050> but<00:01:21.260> then<00:01:21.440> if

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:21.620 
can get this gun certainly but then if

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:22.810 
can get this gun certainly but then if
you<00:01:21.770> only<00:01:21.920> get<00:01:22.100> this<00:01:22.220> gun

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:22.820 
you only get this gun

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:25.390 
you only get this gun
I<00:01:22.850> suggest<00:01:23.450> you<00:01:23.600> form<00:01:23.870> eclipses<00:01:24.290> and<00:01:24.440> heels<00:01:24.710> as

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:25.400 
I suggest you form eclipses and heels as

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.400 
I suggest you form eclipses and heels as

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:29.600 
can kill him very quickly you can use

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.380 
can kill him very quickly you can use
the<00:01:29.750> Gooch<00:01:29.930> that<00:01:30.230> I<00:01:30.470> showed<00:01:31.400> in<00:01:31.610> my<00:01:31.640> one<00:01:32.180> of<00:01:32.270> my

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:32.390 
the Gooch that I showed in my one of my

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.830 
the Gooch that I showed in my one of my
latest<00:01:33.050> videos<00:01:33.230> recent<00:01:34.010> videos<00:01:34.720> but<00:01:35.720> then

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:35.840 
latest videos recent videos but then

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.510 
latest videos recent videos but then
that's<00:01:35.990> not<00:01:36.170> a<00:01:36.200> way<00:01:36.350> to<00:01:36.380> get<00:01:36.650> it<00:01:36.800> right<00:01:37.280> I've

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 
that's not a way to get it right I've

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.440 
that's not a way to get it right I've
become<00:01:37.790> badasses<00:01:38.330> or<00:01:38.780> bosses<00:01:40.120> so<00:01:41.120> then<00:01:41.300> that's

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:41.450 
become badasses or bosses so then that's

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:43.200 
become badasses or bosses so then that's
basically<00:01:41.780> it<00:01:42.020> Lester<00:01:42.350> brought<00:01:42.530> a<00:01:42.590> gun
