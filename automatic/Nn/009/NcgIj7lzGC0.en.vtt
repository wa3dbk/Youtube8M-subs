going to be heading up to space and we

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.720 
going to be heading up to space and we
are<00:00:19.770> going<00:00:19.949> to<00:00:20.100> create<00:00:20.520> a<00:00:20.990> UFO<00:00:22.070> space<00:00:23.070> station

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
are going to create a UFO space station

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.179 
are going to create a UFO space station
slash<00:00:24.210> village<00:00:24.779> it's<00:00:25.380> gonna<00:00:25.529> be<00:00:25.710> awesome

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
slash village it's gonna be awesome

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.169 
slash village it's gonna be awesome
can't<00:00:26.550> wait<00:00:26.730> to<00:00:26.849> get<00:00:26.970> started<00:00:27.570> so<00:00:28.230> let's<00:00:28.650> do<00:00:28.859> it

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:29.179 
can't wait to get started so let's do it

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:31.999 
can't wait to get started so let's do it
so<00:00:30.179> just<00:00:30.660> as<00:00:30.779> we're<00:00:30.929> getting<00:00:31.080> started<00:00:31.740> with

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
so just as we're getting started with

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.940 
so just as we're getting started with
our<00:00:32.279> build<00:00:32.820> here<00:00:33.149> I<00:00:33.360> was<00:00:34.020> thinking<00:00:34.050> about<00:00:34.410> you

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
our build here I was thinking about you

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.900 
our build here I was thinking about you
know<00:00:35.100> what<00:00:35.399> I<00:00:35.579> would<00:00:35.969> design<00:00:36.770> for<00:00:37.770> a<00:00:37.800> UFO<00:00:38.070> sort

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
know what I would design for a UFO sort

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.670 
know what I would design for a UFO sort
of<00:00:39.030> um<00:00:39.379> base<00:00:40.379> and<00:00:41.000> you<00:00:42.000> know<00:00:42.149> I<00:00:42.180> guess<00:00:42.600> you<00:00:43.559> know

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
of um base and you know I guess you know

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.920 
of um base and you know I guess you know
you<00:00:43.739> think<00:00:44.040> about<00:00:44.280> what<00:00:44.850> have<00:00:44.940> you<00:00:45.090> seen<00:00:45.420> of

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
you think about what have you seen of

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.470 
you think about what have you seen of
UFOs<00:00:46.530> and<00:00:46.829> like<00:00:46.920> movies<00:00:47.370> and<00:00:47.610> stuff<00:00:47.789> like<00:00:47.969> that

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
UFOs and like movies and stuff like that

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.400 
UFOs and like movies and stuff like that
and<00:00:48.920> you<00:00:49.920> know<00:00:50.039> they<00:00:50.160> tend<00:00:50.399> to<00:00:50.520> be<00:00:50.760> like<00:00:50.969> those

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:51.410 
and you know they tend to be like those

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:54.860 
and you know they tend to be like those
domed<00:00:52.410> sort<00:00:53.280> of<00:00:53.430> you<00:00:54.090> know<00:00:54.120> they're<00:00:54.570> kind<00:00:54.780> of

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
domed sort of you know they're kind of

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.130 
domed sort of you know they're kind of
they're<00:00:55.199> very<00:00:55.230> symmetrical<00:00:56.160> very<00:00:57.140> minimalist

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
they're very symmetrical very minimalist

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.889 
they're very symmetrical very minimalist
sort<00:00:58.620> of<00:00:58.710> design<00:00:59.070> so<00:00:59.579> you<00:00:59.969> know<00:01:00.449> there's<00:01:00.600> not

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
sort of design so you know there's not

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.630 
sort of design so you know there's not
like<00:01:01.079> lots<00:01:01.410> of<00:01:01.469> random<00:01:01.920> things<00:01:01.949> hanging<00:01:02.430> off

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
like lots of random things hanging off

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.670 
like lots of random things hanging off
them<00:01:02.879> and<00:01:03.000> stuff<00:01:03.239> like<00:01:03.359> that<00:01:03.629> so<00:01:04.409> I<00:01:04.439> thought

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
them and stuff like that so I thought

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.480 
them and stuff like that so I thought
I'd<00:01:04.830> build<00:01:05.220> like<00:01:05.430> a<00:01:05.460> core<00:01:06.500> area<00:01:07.500> and<00:01:08.040> then<00:01:08.220> sort

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
I'd build like a core area and then sort

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.780 
I'd build like a core area and then sort
of<00:01:08.580> spread<00:01:09.090> out<00:01:09.240> the<00:01:09.479> base<00:01:09.659> from<00:01:09.990> there<00:01:10.229> and

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:10.790 
of spread out the base from there and

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:14.240 
of spread out the base from there and
yeah<00:01:11.790> see<00:01:12.150> how<00:01:12.330> we<00:01:12.420> go<00:01:12.600> with<00:01:12.750> it<00:01:12.869> so<00:01:13.049> as<00:01:13.770> always

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
yeah see how we go with it so as always

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.219 
yeah see how we go with it so as always
I<00:01:14.400> put<00:01:14.700> some<00:01:14.820> music<00:01:14.939> to<00:01:15.270> this<00:01:15.390> and<00:01:15.659> have<00:01:16.049> been<00:01:16.080> a

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
I put some music to this and have been a

00:01:16.229 --> 00:02:20.130 
I put some music to this and have been a
fun

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.720 

all<00:02:21.140> righty<00:02:21.380> so<00:02:21.860> we're<00:02:22.310> about<00:02:22.400> halfway

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
all righty so we're about halfway

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.270 
all righty so we're about halfway
through<00:02:22.910> our<00:02:23.180> design<00:02:23.450> and<00:02:24.170> what<00:02:24.950> I<00:02:24.980> really

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
through our design and what I really

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.030 
through our design and what I really
like<00:02:25.460> about<00:02:25.730> starting<00:02:26.570> with<00:02:26.750> like<00:02:27.170> the<00:02:27.500> center

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
like about starting with like the center

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.400 
like about starting with like the center
of<00:02:28.070> your<00:02:28.310> base<00:02:28.550> is<00:02:29.150> that<00:02:29.420> it's<00:02:29.570> up<00:02:29.750> to<00:02:29.780> you<00:02:30.110> how

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410 
of your base is that it's up to you how

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:32.530 
of your base is that it's up to you how
you<00:02:30.470> want<00:02:30.710> to<00:02:30.770> design<00:02:30.950> the<00:02:31.400> outer<00:02:31.700> components

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
you want to design the outer components

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:34.900 
you want to design the outer components
of<00:02:32.660> your<00:02:33.050> space<00:02:33.350> station<00:02:33.530> so<00:02:34.490> some<00:02:34.700> of<00:02:34.730> you

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:34.910 
of your space station so some of you

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:36.520 
of your space station so some of you
might<00:02:35.120> want<00:02:35.300> to<00:02:35.330> build<00:02:35.570> like<00:02:35.810> massive<00:02:36.260> laser

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
might want to build like massive laser

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:39.670 
might want to build like massive laser
guns<00:02:36.980> on<00:02:37.220> the<00:02:37.340> side<00:02:37.640> or<00:02:38.030> some<00:02:38.960> space<00:02:39.260> stations

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
guns on the side or some space stations

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.160 
guns on the side or some space stations
tend<00:02:39.980> to<00:02:40.160> resemble<00:02:40.640> animals<00:02:41.180> from<00:02:41.480> Earth

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
tend to resemble animals from Earth

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:44.080 
tend to resemble animals from Earth
so<00:02:42.620> sometimes<00:02:42.980> people<00:02:43.310> turn<00:02:43.490> them<00:02:43.670> into<00:02:43.790> giant

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
so sometimes people turn them into giant

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:47.650 
so sometimes people turn them into giant
spiders<00:02:45.020> or<00:02:45.350> crabs<00:02:45.770> with<00:02:46.100> big<00:02:46.640> pincer<00:02:47.209> lasers

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:47.660 
spiders or crabs with big pincer lasers

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:50.949 
spiders or crabs with big pincer lasers
around<00:02:47.780> the<00:02:48.080> front<00:02:49.480> you<00:02:50.480> can<00:02:50.540> go<00:02:50.780> the

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:50.959 
around the front you can go the

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:52.420 
around the front you can go the
traditional<00:02:51.110> method<00:02:51.740> which<00:02:51.890> is<00:02:52.010> up<00:02:52.160> what<00:02:52.340> I'm

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430 
traditional method which is up what I'm

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:54.220 
traditional method which is up what I'm
gonna<00:02:52.580> try<00:02:52.790> and<00:02:53.120> do<00:02:53.240> a<00:02:53.270> bit<00:02:53.480> of<00:02:53.510> a<00:02:53.630> glass<00:02:53.840> dome

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230 
gonna try and do a bit of a glass dome

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:57.130 
gonna try and do a bit of a glass dome
on<00:02:54.500> the<00:02:54.530> top<00:02:55.330> another<00:02:56.330> thing<00:02:56.660> that's<00:02:56.900> really

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:57.140 
on the top another thing that's really

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:00.490 
on the top another thing that's really
fun<00:02:57.590> to<00:02:57.620> use<00:02:57.850> gemstar<00:02:58.850> blocks<00:02:59.390> which<00:03:00.200> are<00:03:00.380> just

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
fun to use gemstar blocks which are just

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:34.620 
like mine and look even looking at it

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:35.540 
like mine and look even looking at it
now<00:05:34.740> if<00:05:34.919> I<00:05:35.010> was<00:05:35.100> probably<00:05:35.250> going<00:05:35.460> to<00:05:35.520> change

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:35.550 
now if I was probably going to change

something I'd make the dome on the top a
bit<00:05:37.680> smoother<00:05:38.250> and<00:05:38.460> wider

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:39.270

always<00:05:42.060> freestyle<00:05:42.720> my<00:05:42.870> builds<00:05:43.260> I<00:05:43.410> just<00:05:43.680> get<00:05:44.070> a

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:44.100 
always freestyle my builds I just get a

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:46.340 
always freestyle my builds I just get a
bunch<00:05:44.340> of<00:05:44.520> stuff<00:05:44.760> and<00:05:44.910> build<00:05:45.150> it<00:05:45.330> so<00:05:45.690> I<00:05:46.050> think

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:46.350 
bunch of stuff and build it so I think

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:48.050 
bunch of stuff and build it so I think
that's<00:05:46.650> the<00:05:46.740> secret<00:05:47.070> to<00:05:47.280> base<00:05:47.430> building<00:05:47.850> like

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:48.060 
that's the secret to base building like

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:50.000 
that's the secret to base building like
don't<00:05:48.300> try<00:05:48.419> and<00:05:48.570> plan<00:05:48.750> it<00:05:48.900> too<00:05:49.050> much<00:05:49.200> just<00:05:49.830> grab
