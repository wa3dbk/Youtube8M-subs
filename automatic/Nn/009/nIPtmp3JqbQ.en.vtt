nice to find out about all these ways

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.410

thinking<00:01:55.049> will<00:01:55.320> how<00:01:56.189> would<00:01:56.430> you<00:01:56.549> explain<00:01:56.640> that

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
thinking will how would you explain that

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.730 
thinking will how would you explain that
how<00:01:57.210> does<00:01:57.270> that<00:01:57.479> work<00:01:57.689> and<00:01:57.930> he<00:01:58.049> lose<00:01:58.439> nothing

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
how does that work and he lose nothing

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.679 
how does that work and he lose nothing
unexplained<00:01:59.369> so<00:01:59.549> that's<00:01:59.700> great<00:02:00.030> so<00:02:00.450> my

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
unexplained so that's great so my

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:01.850 
unexplained so that's great so my
feelings<00:02:01.020> about<00:02:01.110> this<00:02:01.229> book<00:02:01.439> i<00:02:01.560> guess<00:02:01.710> the

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
feelings about this book i guess the

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.590 
feelings about this book i guess the
first<00:02:02.070> book<00:02:02.280> five<00:02:02.520> stars<00:02:02.880> i<00:02:03.060> gave<00:02:03.299> this<00:02:03.450> one

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
first book five stars i gave this one

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.420 
first book five stars i gave this one
four<00:02:03.869> stars<00:02:04.200> so<00:02:04.409> evidently<00:02:04.710> i<00:02:04.950> didn't<00:02:05.219> enjoy

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
four stars so evidently i didn't enjoy

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.520 
four stars so evidently i didn't enjoy
it<00:02:05.549> as<00:02:05.640> much<00:02:05.700> as<00:02:05.909> the<00:02:06.149> first<00:02:06.360> one<00:02:06.570> so<00:02:07.170> my

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
it as much as the first one so my

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.219 
it as much as the first one so my
reasons<00:02:08.039> for<00:02:08.099> that<00:02:08.280> are<00:02:08.550> this<00:02:09.239> makes<00:02:09.450> longer<00:02:10.080> i

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
reasons for that are this makes longer i

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.000 
reasons for that are this makes longer i

as<00:02:20.439> I<00:02:20.560> like<00:02:20.709> her<00:02:20.860> kind<00:02:21.040> of<00:02:21.280> it<00:02:21.430> like<00:02:21.610> this<00:02:21.700> is

00:02:21.839 --> 00:02:21.849 
as I like her kind of it like this is

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:23.970 
as I like her kind of it like this is
can<00:02:21.970> I<00:02:22.000> skip<00:02:22.209> this<00:02:22.360> bit<00:02:22.599> I<00:02:22.810> just<00:02:23.739> felt<00:02:23.920> like

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
can I skip this bit I just felt like

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:28.740 
can I skip this bit I just felt like
this<00:02:24.220> but<00:02:24.459> was<00:02:24.670> very<00:02:25.269> slow<00:02:25.930> so<00:02:26.769> it<00:02:27.390> took<00:02:28.390> a<00:02:28.450> long

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
this but was very slow so it took a long

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:31.649 
this but was very slow so it took a long
time<00:02:28.810> to<00:02:29.440> talk<00:02:29.709> about<00:02:29.739> not<00:02:30.610> much<00:02:30.819> really<00:02:30.849> and<00:02:31.510> I

00:02:31.649 --> 00:02:31.659 
time to talk about not much really and I

00:02:31.659 --> 00:02:33.089 
time to talk about not much really and I
think<00:02:31.840> it's<00:02:31.959> because<00:02:32.019> this<00:02:32.349> book<00:02:32.560> wanted<00:02:32.980> to

00:02:33.089 --> 00:02:33.099 
think it's because this book wanted to

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:36.059 
think it's because this book wanted to
do<00:02:33.310> sort<00:02:33.670> of<00:02:33.760> more<00:02:34.319> political<00:02:35.319> intrigue<00:02:35.739> and

00:02:36.059 --> 00:02:36.069 
do sort of more political intrigue and

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:38.339 
do sort of more political intrigue and
the<00:02:36.190> way<00:02:36.340> the<00:02:36.579> court<00:02:36.819> system<00:02:37.209> worked<00:02:37.450> the<00:02:38.140> wire

00:02:38.339 --> 00:02:38.349 
the way the court system worked the wire

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:40.050 
the way the court system worked the wire
drums<00:02:38.680> or<00:02:38.920> betraying<00:02:39.400> one<00:02:39.670> enough<00:02:39.849> for<00:02:39.970> all

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
drums or betraying one enough for all

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.149 
drums or betraying one enough for all
these<00:02:40.150> secrets<00:02:40.420> and<00:02:40.810> in<00:02:41.530> order<00:02:41.680> to<00:02:41.769> do<00:02:41.950> that<00:02:42.099> it

00:02:42.149 --> 00:02:42.159 
these secrets and in order to do that it

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:43.860 
these secrets and in order to do that it
does<00:02:42.370> take<00:02:42.579> a<00:02:42.609> longer<00:02:42.909> time<00:02:42.939> much<00:02:43.359> more<00:02:43.540> detail

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
does take a longer time much more detail

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:45.390 
does take a longer time much more detail
needs<00:02:44.049> to<00:02:44.170> put<00:02:44.349> him<00:02:44.500> it<00:02:44.739> wasn't<00:02:45.250> so<00:02:45.370> much

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
needs to put him it wasn't so much

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.289 
needs to put him it wasn't so much
non-stop<00:02:45.849> action<00:02:46.390> as<00:02:46.480> the<00:02:46.569> first<00:02:46.810> one<00:02:47.129> so<00:02:48.299> for

00:02:49.289 --> 00:02:49.299 
non-stop action as the first one so for

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:51.149 
non-stop action as the first one so for
that<00:02:49.390> reason<00:02:49.450> it<00:02:49.720> was<00:02:49.810> slower<00:02:50.049> but<00:02:50.680> once<00:02:50.950> I'd

00:02:51.149 --> 00:02:51.159 
that reason it was slower but once I'd

00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:52.289 
that reason it was slower but once I'd
rather<00:02:51.370> I<00:02:51.639> sort<00:02:51.879> of<00:02:51.909> thought<00:02:52.000> you<00:02:52.060> know<00:02:52.150> this

00:02:52.289 --> 00:02:52.299 
rather I sort of thought you know this

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:53.940 
rather I sort of thought you know this

what<00:02:54.579> actually<00:02:54.879> happened<00:02:55.720> so<00:02:56.170> not<00:02:56.409> much

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
what actually happened so not much

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.589 
what actually happened so not much
really<00:02:57.069> happens<00:02:57.549> I<00:02:57.790> think<00:02:58.000> a<00:02:58.329> lot<00:02:58.480> of<00:02:58.510> the

00:02:58.589 --> 00:02:58.599 
really happens I think a lot of the

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:00.300 
really happens I think a lot of the
stuff<00:02:59.019> in<00:02:59.139> this<00:02:59.230> book<00:02:59.500> is<00:02:59.530> sort<00:02:59.859> of<00:02:59.950> like<00:03:00.129> a

stuff in this book is sort of like a
bridge<00:03:00.730> to<00:03:01.060> the<00:03:01.120> third<00:03:01.359> book<00:03:01.629> so<00:03:02.200> it's

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090 
really enjoyed it and like I said never

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:14.520 
really enjoyed it and like I said never
bothered<00:03:13.540> me<00:03:13.569> there<00:03:13.840> was<00:03:13.989> slow<00:03:14.230> so<00:03:14.260> it's

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
bothered me there was slow so it's

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:15.899 
bothered me there was slow so it's
difficult<00:03:14.680> to<00:03:14.980> explain<00:03:15.069> didn't<00:03:15.579> bother<00:03:15.730> me

00:03:15.899 --> 00:03:15.909 
difficult to explain didn't bother me

00:03:15.909 --> 00:03:18.839 
difficult to explain didn't bother me
but<00:03:16.900> I<00:03:16.959> recognized<00:03:17.680> it<00:03:17.709> and<00:03:18.190> see<00:03:18.459> that<00:03:18.669> maybe

00:03:18.839 --> 00:03:18.849 
but I recognized it and see that maybe

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:21.300 
but I recognized it and see that maybe
it<00:03:19.060> could<00:03:19.269> have<00:03:19.389> been<00:03:19.510> done<00:03:19.690> better<00:03:20.310> also

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:21.310 
it could have been done better also

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:24.270 
it could have been done better also
there's<00:03:22.000> a<00:03:22.269> romance<00:03:22.780> in<00:03:23.049> this<00:03:23.410> series<00:03:23.620> and<00:03:24.069> I

there's a romance in this series and I
felt<00:03:24.489> the<00:03:24.669> romance<00:03:25.060> was<00:03:25.269> done<00:03:25.419> so<00:03:25.690> much<00:03:25.870> better

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:26.049 
felt the romance was done so much better

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:27.360 
felt the romance was done so much better
in<00:03:26.169> the<00:03:26.230> first<00:03:26.470> book<00:03:26.680> the<00:03:26.739> very<00:03:27.069> much<00:03:27.190> we'll

character I think you pronounce his name

00:04:05.409 --> 00:04:07.890 
character I think you pronounce his name
dazed<00:04:05.980> I'm<00:04:06.849> not<00:04:07.000> quite<00:04:07.180> sure<00:04:07.209> but<00:04:07.629> I<00:04:07.780> think

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:07.900 
dazed I'm not quite sure but I think

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:09.750 
dazed I'm not quite sure but I think
he's<00:04:08.139> excellent<00:04:08.650> and<00:04:09.159> I<00:04:09.340> think<00:04:09.400> this<00:04:09.639> has

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:09.760 
he's excellent and I think this has

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:10.920 
he's excellent and I think this has
really<00:04:10.030> set<00:04:10.329> the<00:04:10.419> scene<00:04:10.569> with<00:04:10.720> the<00:04:10.780> third

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:10.930 
really set the scene with the third

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:12.089 
really set the scene with the third
books<00:04:11.169> I<00:04:11.290> think<00:04:11.409> the<00:04:11.470> third<00:04:11.620> book<00:04:11.769> is<00:04:11.889> going<00:04:12.010> to

00:04:12.089 --> 00:04:12.099 
books I think the third book is going to

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:13.770 
books I think the third book is going to
be<00:04:12.159> with<00:04:12.310> action<00:04:12.699> packed<00:04:12.909> and<00:04:13.150> excellent<00:04:13.659> and

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:13.780 
be with action packed and excellent and

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:14.580
