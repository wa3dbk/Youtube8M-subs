overview<00:00:07.049> the<00:00:07.890> red<00:00:08.069> gear<00:00:08.370> is<00:00:08.519> the<00:00:08.669> input<00:00:08.849> gear

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:09.440 
overview the red gear is the input gear

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:13.189 
overview the red gear is the input gear
the<00:00:10.440> green<00:00:10.740> gear<00:00:11.070> is<00:00:11.539> one<00:00:12.539> of<00:00:12.659> the<00:00:12.780> optional

00:00:13.189 --> 00:00:13.199 
the green gear is one of the optional

00:00:13.199 --> 00:00:15.409 
the green gear is one of the optional
output<00:00:13.679> gears<00:00:13.980> you<00:00:14.490> can<00:00:14.610> have<00:00:14.789> them<00:00:14.969> either

00:00:15.409 --> 00:00:15.419 
output gears you can have them either

00:00:15.419 --> 00:00:19.870 
output gears you can have them either
one<00:00:15.839> of<00:00:15.869> these<00:00:16.550> gray<00:00:17.550> gears<00:00:17.849> over<00:00:18.119> here<00:00:18.390> and

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:19.880 
one of these gray gears over here and

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:23.870 
one of these gray gears over here and
the<00:00:20.880> mechanism<00:00:21.449> works<00:00:21.689> by<00:00:22.669> rectifying<00:00:23.669> the

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
the mechanism works by rectifying the

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.390 
the mechanism works by rectifying the
rotation<00:00:24.570> that<00:00:25.410> you<00:00:25.529> input<00:00:25.740> from<00:00:26.130> the<00:00:26.189> red

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
rotation that you input from the red

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.909 
rotation that you input from the red
gear<00:00:26.669> so<00:00:27.029> I'll<00:00:27.240> demonstrate<00:00:27.480> here<00:00:28.050> you'll

00:00:28.909 --> 00:00:28.919 
gear so I'll demonstrate here you'll

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:31.600 
gear so I'll demonstrate here you'll
notice<00:00:29.189> that<00:00:29.429> if<00:00:29.880> I<00:00:30.029> rotate<00:00:30.539> the<00:00:30.689> red<00:00:30.900> gear

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:31.610 
notice that if I rotate the red gear

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:34.280 
notice that if I rotate the red gear
counterclockwise<00:00:32.750> then<00:00:33.750> from<00:00:34.050> this

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
counterclockwise then from this

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.110 
counterclockwise then from this
perspective<00:00:34.680> the<00:00:35.190> green<00:00:35.520> gear<00:00:35.790> turns

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
perspective the green gear turns

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.460 
perspective the green gear turns
counterclockwise<00:00:36.420> as<00:00:37.320> well<00:00:38.960> I'll<00:00:39.960> give<00:00:40.170> a<00:00:40.200> few

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:40.470 
counterclockwise as well I'll give a few

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:42.950 
counterclockwise as well I'll give a few
aura<00:00:40.650> tations<00:00:41.160> here<00:00:41.370> you<00:00:41.550> can<00:00:41.700> see<00:00:41.910> it<00:00:42.000> now<00:00:42.180> if

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
aura tations here you can see it now if

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.320 
aura tations here you can see it now if
I<00:00:43.140> change<00:00:43.650> the<00:00:44.130> direction<00:00:44.280> of<00:00:44.700> rotation<00:00:44.760> on

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:45.330 
I change the direction of rotation on

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:48.770 
I change the direction of rotation on
the<00:00:45.360> red<00:00:45.660> gear<00:00:46.340> you<00:00:47.340> can<00:00:47.520> see<00:00:47.760> that<00:00:48.330> the<00:00:48.540> green

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
the red gear you can see that the green

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.680 
the red gear you can see that the green
here<00:00:49.110> still<00:00:49.500> rotates<00:00:49.980> in<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.250> same<00:00:50.460> direction

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:50.690 
here still rotates in the same direction

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:53.510 
here still rotates in the same direction
and<00:00:51.690> I<00:00:51.810> haven't<00:00:52.200> actually<00:00:52.380> activated<00:00:53.280> any

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
and I haven't actually activated any

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.440 
and I haven't actually activated any
mechanism<00:00:54.270> or<00:00:54.540> anything<00:00:55.110> it's<00:00:55.590> all<00:00:55.710> automatic

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:56.450 
mechanism or anything it's all automatic

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:00.260 
mechanism or anything it's all automatic
so<00:00:57.450> what<00:00:58.380> happens<00:00:58.800> here<00:00:58.890> is<00:00:59.310> that<00:00:59.400> the<00:01:00.060> red

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
so what happens here is that the red

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.110 
so what happens here is that the red
gear<00:01:00.600> drives<00:01:01.020> the<00:01:01.740> blue<00:01:02.040> gear<00:01:02.310> I'll<00:01:02.940> try<00:01:03.060> to

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
gear drives the blue gear I'll try to

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.570 
gear drives the blue gear I'll try to
find<00:01:03.270> a<00:01:03.450> good<00:01:03.600> perspective<00:01:03.870> for<00:01:04.320> this<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:05.370> red

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
find a good perspective for this the red

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.720 
find a good perspective for this the red
geared<00:01:05.880> draw<00:01:06.150> drives<00:01:07.140> a<00:01:07.410> blue<00:01:07.920> gear<00:01:08.190> over<00:01:08.430> here

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:08.730 
geared draw drives a blue gear over here

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:11.690 
geared draw drives a blue gear over here
which<00:01:09.690> drives<00:01:10.170> two<00:01:10.620> of<00:01:10.770> these<00:01:10.980> gray<00:01:11.370> gears

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
which drives two of these gray gears

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.230 
which drives two of these gray gears
right<00:01:11.970> here<00:01:12.470> the<00:01:13.470> gray<00:01:13.710> gears<00:01:14.100> see<00:01:14.460> sit<00:01:15.000> on

other<00:01:45.570> one<00:01:45.780> right<00:01:45.960> here<00:01:46.229> now<00:01:46.890> here<00:01:47.700> you<00:01:47.729> have

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:48.470 
other one right here now here you have

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:51.200 
other one right here now here you have
the<00:01:49.470> blue<00:01:49.680> gear<00:01:49.920> driving<00:01:50.340> these<00:01:50.520> two<00:01:50.760> years<00:01:51.060> so

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
the blue gear driving these two years so

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.000 
the blue gear driving these two years so
they<00:01:51.390> both<00:01:51.630> want<00:01:51.960> to<00:01:52.200> rotate<00:01:52.380> in<00:01:52.830> the

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:53.010 
they both want to rotate in the

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:55.880 
they both want to rotate in the
assembler<00:01:53.430> in<00:01:53.610> the<00:01:53.729> same<00:01:53.909> direction<00:01:54.440> but<00:01:55.440> you

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
assembler in the same direction but you

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.500 
assembler in the same direction but you
can<00:01:56.010> see<00:01:56.190> these<00:01:56.460> two<00:01:56.790> gives<00:01:57.030> here<00:01:57.240> which<00:01:57.390> I

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:57.510 
can see these two gives here which I

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:59.690 
can see these two gives here which I
connected<00:01:57.930> by<00:01:58.080> rigid<00:01:58.320> axles<00:01:58.920> to<00:01:59.190> these<00:01:59.400> gears

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
connected by rigid axles to these gears

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.359 
connected by rigid axles to these gears
the<00:02:00.000> small<00:02:00.270> ones<00:02:00.479> are<00:02:00.570> connected<00:02:00.960> disease

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:01.369 
the small ones are connected disease

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:03.859 
the small ones are connected disease
they're<00:02:02.369> connected<00:02:02.790> by<00:02:02.909> two<00:02:02.970> gears<00:02:03.450> between

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
they're connected by two gears between

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:07.700 
they're connected by two gears between
them<00:02:04.110> so<00:02:04.680> they'd<00:02:05.580> like<00:02:05.850> ideally<00:02:06.479> to<00:02:07.140> rotate<00:02:07.530> in

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
them so they'd like ideally to rotate in

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.109 
them so they'd like ideally to rotate in
different<00:02:08.249> directions

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
different directions

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.339 
different directions
what<00:02:10.119> this<00:02:10.270> means<00:02:10.539> is<00:02:10.720> that<00:02:10.780> there's<00:02:11.110> some

00:02:11.339 --> 00:02:11.349 
what this means is that there's some

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:14.610 
what this means is that there's some
sort<00:02:11.379> of<00:02:11.650> force<00:02:12.010> on<00:02:12.660> on<00:02:13.660> the<00:02:13.930> gears<00:02:14.140> here<00:02:14.379> which

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
sort of force on on the gears here which

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.830 
sort of force on on the gears here which
would<00:02:15.310> normally<00:02:15.550> jam<00:02:16.150> the<00:02:16.360> gears<00:02:16.599> if

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
would normally jam the gears if

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.770 
would normally jam the gears if
everything<00:02:17.470> was<00:02:17.590> just<00:02:17.860> kind<00:02:18.310> of<00:02:18.370> rigid<00:02:18.780> but

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
everything was just kind of rigid but

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:24.500 
everything was just kind of rigid but
what<00:02:20.290> happens<00:02:20.769> is<00:02:21.160> that<00:02:22.200> these<00:02:23.200> sit<00:02:23.620> here<00:02:23.980> the

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
what happens is that these sit here the

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.059 
what happens is that these sit here the
gray<00:02:25.510> gear<00:02:25.750> see<00:02:25.959> it<00:02:26.050> on<00:02:26.170> top<00:02:26.380> of<00:02:26.440> the<00:02:26.620> blue<00:02:26.890> gear

00:02:27.059 --> 00:02:27.069 
gray gear see it on top of the blue gear

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:29.009 
gray gear see it on top of the blue gear
and<00:02:27.280> depending<00:02:28.209> on<00:02:28.330> the<00:02:28.450> direction<00:02:28.630> of

00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:29.019 
and depending on the direction of

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:30.990 
and depending on the direction of
rotation<00:02:29.080> one<00:02:29.860> is<00:02:30.040> kind<00:02:30.250> of<00:02:30.310> lifted<00:02:30.670> up<00:02:30.819> in

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
rotation one is kind of lifted up in

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.330 
rotation one is kind of lifted up in
this<00:02:31.180> case<00:02:31.390> the<00:02:32.050> left<00:02:32.290> one<00:02:32.530> is<00:02:32.560> lifted<00:02:33.040> up<00:02:33.160> and

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
this case the left one is lifted up and

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:36.030 
this case the left one is lifted up and
the<00:02:33.489> right<00:02:33.700> one<00:02:33.730> is<00:02:34.209> pulled<00:02:34.630> down<00:02:34.930> and<00:02:35.230> because

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
the right one is pulled down and because

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.500 
the right one is pulled down and because
they<00:02:36.190> sit<00:02:36.430> on<00:02:36.459> lever<00:02:36.880> arms<00:02:37.450> you<00:02:38.140> can<00:02:38.319> kind<00:02:38.500> of

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
they sit on lever arms you can kind of

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.150 
they sit on lever arms you can kind of
they<00:02:40.510> have<00:02:40.720> the<00:02:40.900> freedom<00:02:41.290> to<00:02:41.319> move<00:02:41.620> and<00:02:41.860> click

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.160 
they have the freedom to move and click

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.910 
they have the freedom to move and click
away<00:02:42.340> and<00:02:42.760> that<00:02:43.420> way<00:02:43.599> it<00:02:43.750> resolves<00:02:44.410> the

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
away and that way it resolves the

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.660 
away and that way it resolves the
conflict<00:02:45.190> between<00:02:45.910> the<00:02:46.480> gear<00:02:47.430> between<00:02:48.430> this

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
conflict between the gear between this

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:50.660 
conflict between the gear between this
set<00:02:48.910> of<00:02:49.060> gears<00:02:49.299> and<00:02:49.510> this<00:02:49.690> set<00:02:49.870> of<00:02:49.989> gears<00:02:50.230> and

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
set of gears and this set of gears and

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:54.780 
set of gears and this set of gears and
if<00:02:51.670> I<00:02:51.819> rotate<00:02:52.180> this<00:02:52.390> way<00:02:52.660> then<00:02:53.340> the<00:02:54.340> left<00:02:54.519> one

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
if I rotate this way then the left one

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:56.910 
if I rotate this way then the left one
will<00:02:54.910> jump<00:02:55.239> over<00:02:55.450> to<00:02:55.540> the<00:02:55.780> other<00:02:55.930> way<00:02:56.230> the

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:56.920 
will jump over to the other way the

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:00.449 
will jump over to the other way the
other<00:02:56.950> one<00:02:57.400> will<00:02:57.579> jump<00:02:57.849> and<00:02:59.099> that's<00:03:00.099> about<00:03:00.310> it

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:00.459 
other one will jump and that's about it

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:03.660 
other one will jump and that's about it
I<00:03:00.760> think<00:03:01.440> you<00:03:02.440> can<00:03:02.590> have<00:03:02.769> the<00:03:02.920> green<00:03:03.160> gear<00:03:03.489> on

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670 
I think you can have the green gear on

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:07.199 
I think you can have the green gear on
either<00:03:03.940> one<00:03:04.299> of<00:03:04.569> these<00:03:05.099> great<00:03:06.099> years<00:03:06.370> so<00:03:07.150> you

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:07.209 
either one of these great years so you

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:10.559 
either one of these great years so you
could<00:03:07.569> have<00:03:07.599> the<00:03:07.780> bias<00:03:08.349> the<00:03:08.650> other<00:03:08.920> way<00:03:09.569> right

00:03:10.559 --> 00:03:10.569 
could have the bias the other way right

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:13.229 
could have the bias the other way right
now<00:03:10.780> it<00:03:11.040> rotates<00:03:12.040> if<00:03:12.610> you<00:03:12.760> look<00:03:12.910> at<00:03:13.030> it<00:03:13.090> from

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:13.239 
now it rotates if you look at it from

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:16.559 
now it rotates if you look at it from
this<00:03:13.450> perspective<00:03:13.739> it<00:03:14.739> rotates<00:03:15.420> always<00:03:16.420> to

00:03:16.559 --> 00:03:16.569 
this perspective it rotates always to

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:18.720 
this perspective it rotates always to
the<00:03:16.600> counterclockwise<00:03:17.139> direction<00:03:17.579> you<00:03:18.579> can

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:18.730 
the counterclockwise direction you can

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:20.250 
the counterclockwise direction you can
choose<00:03:18.880> the<00:03:18.910> other<00:03:19.120> gear<00:03:19.540> and<00:03:19.690> have<00:03:19.810> it<00:03:19.959> always

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260 
choose the other gear and have it always

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.099 
choose the other gear and have it always
rotate<00:03:20.709> to<00:03:20.859> the<00:03:20.889> clockwise<00:03:21.549> direction<00:03:22.109> that's

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:23.109 
rotate to the clockwise direction that's

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:25.380 
rotate to the clockwise direction that's
about<00:03:23.350> it
