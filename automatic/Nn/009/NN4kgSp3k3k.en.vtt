is very convenient and today in our
video<00:00:50.309> I'm<00:00:50.520> going<00:00:50.760> to<00:00:50.850> show<00:00:51.090> you<00:00:51.120> the<00:00:51.420> quality

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:51.860 
video I'm going to show you the quality

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:55.459 
video I'm going to show you the quality
what<00:00:52.860> are<00:00:52.980> the<00:00:53.100> differences<00:00:53.670> between<00:00:54.469> the

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
what are the differences between the

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.889 
what are the differences between the
only<00:00:55.739> n<00:00:55.860> cottages<00:00:56.460> and<00:00:56.699> the<00:00:57.390> compatible

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
only n cottages and the compatible

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.229 
only n cottages and the compatible
cartridges<00:00:58.399> okay<00:00:59.399> so<00:00:59.460> let's<00:00:59.910> take<00:01:00.180> a

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
cartridges okay so let's take a

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.110 
cartridges okay so let's take a
comparison<00:01:01.079> between<00:01:01.559> the<00:01:01.980> both<00:01:02.160> the<00:01:02.670> Audion

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
comparison between the both the Audion

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.620 
comparison between the both the Audion
ink<00:01:03.629> and<00:01:04.729> remanufacture<00:01:05.729> so<00:01:05.970> as<00:01:06.090> you<00:01:06.240> can<00:01:06.420> see

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
ink and remanufacture so as you can see

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.530 
ink and remanufacture so as you can see
on<00:01:06.840> the<00:01:07.049> left<00:01:07.229> side<00:01:07.380> goes<00:01:08.159> to<00:01:08.490> our<00:01:08.729> o<00:01:08.970> young<00:01:09.299> one

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
on the left side goes to our o young one

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.350 
on the left side goes to our o young one
and<00:01:09.950> on<00:01:10.950> the<00:01:11.159> right<00:01:11.340> side<00:01:11.610> the<00:01:11.880> two<00:01:12.090> other

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
and on the right side the two other

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.480 
and on the right side the two other
remanufactured<00:01:13.320> so<00:01:13.650> basically<00:01:14.189> if<00:01:14.400> you

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
remanufactured so basically if you

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.130 
remanufactured so basically if you
compare<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:14.939> physical<00:01:15.299> appearance<00:01:15.750> very<00:01:15.990> is

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
compare the physical appearance very is

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.289 
compare the physical appearance very is
not<00:01:16.170> any<00:01:16.710> differences<00:01:17.310> since<00:01:18.000> the

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
not any differences since the

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.539 
not any differences since the
remanufacture<00:01:19.140> ink<00:01:19.380> is<00:01:19.650> basically<00:01:20.430> a

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
remanufacture ink is basically a

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.980 
remanufacture ink is basically a
recycling<00:01:21.470> from<00:01:22.470> the<00:01:22.860> OEM<00:01:23.189> one<00:01:23.430> and<00:01:23.780> seen<00:01:24.780> in

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
recycling from the OEM one and seen in

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.179 
recycling from the OEM one and seen in
this<00:01:25.200> case<00:01:25.530> this<00:01:26.400> one<00:01:26.640> is<00:01:26.850> basically<00:01:27.090> a<00:01:27.689> 61<00:01:28.650> XL

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
this case this one is basically a 61 XL

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:32.630 
this case this one is basically a 61 XL
so<00:01:29.549> it<00:01:29.880> contain<00:01:30.420> much<00:01:31.110> more<00:01:31.140> ink<00:01:31.799> compared<00:01:32.490> to

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
so it contain much more ink compared to

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.890 
so it contain much more ink compared to
the<00:01:32.759> OE<00:01:32.880> n<00:01:33.290> okay<00:01:34.290> so<00:01:34.409> I'm<00:01:34.829> gonna<00:01:35.100> place<00:01:35.490> the

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:35.900 
the OE n okay so I'm gonna place the

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:38.690 
the OE n okay so I'm gonna place the
remanufactured<00:01:36.900> cartridges<00:01:37.220> inside<00:01:38.220> printer

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
remanufactured cartridges inside printer

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.740 
remanufactured cartridges inside printer
now

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:43.750 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:48.550 

okay<00:01:44.750> score<00:01:45.080> salute<00:01:46.630> okay<00:01:47.630> so<00:01:47.690> the<00:01:48.050> carriages

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:48.560 
okay score salute okay so the carriages

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.620 
okay score salute okay so the carriages
has<00:01:48.740> been<00:01:48.950> successfully<00:01:49.730> recognized<00:01:50.360> by<00:01:50.570> the

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.630 
has been successfully recognized by the

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:54.550 
has been successfully recognized by the
machine<00:01:51.230> because<00:01:51.680> there<00:01:52.400> is<00:01:52.520> no<00:01:52.820> any<00:01:53.560> orange

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:54.560 
machine because there is no any orange

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.290 
machine because there is no any orange
signal<00:01:55.070> shows<00:01:55.370> in<00:01:55.640> here

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:56.300 
signal shows in here

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:59.290 
signal shows in here
okay<00:01:57.170> so<00:01:57.230> this<00:01:57.590> is<00:01:57.770> the<00:01:57.980> stand<00:01:58.280> are<00:01:58.460> a<00:01:58.730> document

00:01:59.290 --> 00:01:59.300 
okay so this is the stand are a document

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:01.600 
okay so this is the stand are a document
that<00:01:59.330> they<00:01:59.990> used<00:02:00.350> to<00:02:00.560> test<00:02:00.800> for<00:02:00.950> the<00:02:01.220> quality

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:01.610 
that they used to test for the quality

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:03.610 
that they used to test for the quality
of<00:02:01.640> the<00:02:01.880> premium<00:02:02.270> performance<00:02:02.450> so<00:02:03.380> if<00:02:03.530> you

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:03.620 
of the premium performance so if you

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:06.280 
of the premium performance so if you
compare<00:02:04.040> the<00:02:04.250> both<00:02:04.490> the<00:02:05.270> Orion<00:02:05.750> on<00:02:05.960> the<00:02:06.080> left

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:06.290 
compare the both the Orion on the left

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:07.810 
compare the both the Orion on the left
side<00:02:06.470> and<00:02:06.740> the<00:02:06.860> rim<00:02:07.040> manufacturer<00:02:07.670> on<00:02:07.760> the

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:07.820 
side and the rim manufacturer on the

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:10.290 
side and the rim manufacturer on the
right<00:02:08.090> side<00:02:08.390> you<00:02:09.020> will<00:02:09.170> realize<00:02:09.649> that

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:10.300 
right side you will realize that

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:13.630 
right side you will realize that
