more milk off its natural cycle do you

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:37.880 
more milk off its natural cycle do you
know<00:00:36.630> what<00:00:36.750> of<00:00:36.840> the<00:00:36.930> cows<00:00:37.200> are<00:00:37.530> being

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
know what of the cows are being

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.010 
know what of the cows are being
force-fed<00:00:38.340> with<00:00:38.730> animal<00:00:39.149> byproducts<00:00:39.930> and

grains<00:00:40.710> after<00:00:41.280> the<00:00:41.399> milk<00:00:41.640> goes<00:00:41.820> through<00:00:42.030> its

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
grains after the milk goes through its

grains after the milk goes through its
pasteurization<00:00:43.079> process<00:00:43.110> all<00:00:43.890> the<00:00:44.370> proteins

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
pasteurization process all the proteins

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.700 
pasteurization process all the proteins
of<00:00:44.969> milk<00:00:45.149> are<00:00:45.300> being<00:00:45.510> denatured<00:00:46.110> what<00:00:46.590> does

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
of milk are being denatured what does

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.650 
of milk are being denatured what does
that<00:00:46.739> mean<00:00:47.129> it's<00:00:47.370> like<00:00:47.789> taking<00:00:48.000> a<00:00:48.180> vegetable

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
that mean it's like taking a vegetable

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.479 
that mean it's like taking a vegetable
and<00:00:48.750> boiling<00:00:48.930> it<00:00:49.110> for<00:00:49.289> hours<00:00:49.620> you've<00:00:50.039> lost<00:00:50.219> its

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
and boiling it for hours you've lost its

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.639 
and boiling it for hours you've lost its
enzyme<00:00:50.940> that<00:00:51.420> milk<00:00:51.780> is<00:00:52.020> void<00:00:52.350> of<00:00:52.530> any

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
enzyme that milk is void of any

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.910 
enzyme that milk is void of any
nutrients<00:00:53.640> and<00:00:53.879> we<00:00:54.300> are<00:00:54.360> consuming<00:00:55.050> this<00:00:55.379> poor

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
nutrients and we are consuming this poor

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.680 
nutrients and we are consuming this poor
quality<00:00:56.399> of<00:00:56.489> milk<00:00:56.789> that<00:00:57.300> is<00:00:57.329> being

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
quality of milk that is being

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.170 
quality of milk that is being

what<00:01:06.060> does<00:01:06.150> it<00:01:06.270> do<00:01:06.420> tura<00:01:06.570> system<00:01:06.960> once<00:01:07.140> it's<00:01:07.350> in

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
what does it do tura system once it's in

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.880 
what does it do tura system once it's in
creates<00:01:08.490> an<00:01:08.670> imbalance<00:01:08.970> of<00:01:09.659> pH<00:01:10.170> in<00:01:10.470> our<00:01:10.680> gut

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
creates an imbalance of pH in our gut

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.670 
creates an imbalance of pH in our gut
what<00:01:11.850> does<00:01:11.970> this<00:01:12.150> cause<00:01:12.420> it<00:01:12.720> creates<00:01:13.170> a

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
what does this cause it creates a

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.920 
what does this cause it creates a
decrease<00:01:14.220> in<00:01:14.250> absorption<00:01:14.790> of<00:01:15.060> calcium<00:01:15.299> into

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
decrease in absorption of calcium into

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.690 
decrease in absorption of calcium into
our<00:01:16.020> bloodstream<00:01:16.170> so<00:01:17.130> our<00:01:17.220> bones<00:01:17.490> are<00:01:17.670> not

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
our bloodstream so our bones are not

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.390 
our bloodstream so our bones are not
getting<00:01:18.090> enough<00:01:18.390> calcium<00:01:19.189> second<00:01:20.189> of<00:01:20.280> all

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
getting enough calcium second of all

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.100 
getting enough calcium second of all
it's<00:01:20.610> going<00:01:20.790> to<00:01:20.850> create<00:01:21.030> inflammation<00:01:21.540> in<00:01:21.990> the

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
it's going to create inflammation in the

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.469 
it's going to create inflammation in the
gut<00:01:22.140> it's<00:01:22.950> going<00:01:23.189> to<00:01:23.220> be<00:01:23.310> a<00:01:23.340> lot<00:01:23.610> of<00:01:23.640> acidity<00:01:24.210> in

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
gut it's going to be a lot of acidity in

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.990 
gut it's going to be a lot of acidity in
the<00:01:24.600> gut<00:01:24.780> which<00:01:25.439> in<00:01:25.650> the<00:01:25.799> long<00:01:25.979> haul<00:01:26.280> is<00:01:26.549> going

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
the gut which in the long haul is going

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.179 
the gut which in the long haul is going
to<00:01:27.060> decrease<00:01:27.420> your<00:01:27.540> immunity<00:01:28.140> and<00:01:28.380> that's<00:01:28.950> why

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
to decrease your immunity and that's why

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.550 
to decrease your immunity and that's why
a<00:01:29.220> lot<00:01:29.310> of<00:01:29.490> people<00:01:29.610> end<00:01:30.210> up<00:01:30.570> being<00:01:30.840> allergic<00:01:31.290> to

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
a lot of people end up being allergic to

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.210 
a lot of people end up being allergic to
milk<00:01:31.950> so<00:01:32.700> imagine<00:01:33.150> this<00:01:33.710> drinking<00:01:34.710> milk<00:01:34.950> over

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
milk so imagine this drinking milk over

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.429 
milk so imagine this drinking milk over
the<00:01:35.340> years<00:01:35.670> is<00:01:35.909> like<00:01:36.329> grabbing<00:01:36.900> a<00:01:37.020> ball<00:01:37.259> of

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
the years is like grabbing a ball of

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.340 
the years is like grabbing a ball of
acid<00:01:37.950> and<00:01:38.040> slowly<00:01:38.759> pouring<00:01:39.299> it<00:01:39.630> over<00:01:39.810> the

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
acid and slowly pouring it over the

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.060 
acid and slowly pouring it over the
bones<00:01:40.610> now<00:01:41.610> you<00:01:42.060> answer<00:01:42.270> this<00:01:42.540> question<00:01:43.070> acid

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
bones now you answer this question acid

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.620 
bones now you answer this question acid
over<00:01:44.280> the<00:01:44.430> bones<00:01:44.640> is<00:01:44.909> it<00:01:45.060> going<00:01:45.210> to<00:01:45.270> build<00:01:45.479> the

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
over the bones is it going to build the

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.330 
over the bones is it going to build the
bones<00:01:45.840> into<00:01:46.259> health<00:01:46.500> stronger<00:01:46.890> bones<00:01:47.070> like

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
bones into health stronger bones like

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.429 
bones into health stronger bones like
what<00:01:47.729> the<00:01:47.880> advertisers<00:01:48.540> wants<00:01:48.810> to<00:01:48.960> believe<00:01:49.229> or

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
what the advertisers wants to believe or

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.770 
what the advertisers wants to believe or
is<00:01:49.829> it<00:01:49.890> going<00:01:50.040> to<00:01:50.100> denature<00:01:50.430> it<00:01:50.759> so<00:01:51.299> we<00:01:51.420> figured

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
is it going to denature it so we figured

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.389 
is it going to denature it so we figured
