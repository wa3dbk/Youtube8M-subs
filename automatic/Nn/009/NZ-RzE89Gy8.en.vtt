should<00:02:51.410> really<00:02:51.620> base<00:02:51.800> it<00:02:51.950> off<00:02:52.100> that<00:02:52.430> but<00:02:52.670> it

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
should really base it off that but it

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.250 
should really base it off that but it
was<00:02:52.880> a<00:02:52.910> pretty<00:02:53.240> cool<00:02:53.390> concept<00:02:53.810> for<00:02:53.900> him<00:02:54.020> to<00:02:54.110> be
