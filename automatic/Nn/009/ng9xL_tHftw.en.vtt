the bank and i think it was like six or
seven<00:00:47.399> mil<00:00:47.789> so<00:00:48.420> now<00:00:48.629> we<00:00:48.690> can<00:00:48.960> go<00:00:49.110> to<00:00:49.170> the<00:00:49.230> price

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
the drops i know it was not that great

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.350

well go price check now as a tradition I
always<00:01:28.229> price<00:01:28.530> check<00:01:28.860> my<00:01:29.100> rare<00:01:29.579> drops<00:01:29.850> first

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
always price check my rare drops first

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
and it looks like i have 1.5 mil maybe

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.870 
and it looks like i have 1.5 mil maybe
two<00:01:34.500> mil<00:01:34.680> more<00:01:34.890> than<00:01:35.070> the<00:01:35.159> last<00:01:35.189> step<00:01:35.520> so<00:01:35.579> it's

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
two mil more than the last step so it's

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.340 
two mil more than the last step so it's
