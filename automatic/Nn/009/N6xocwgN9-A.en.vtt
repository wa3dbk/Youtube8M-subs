but through the years it has dissolved

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.139 
but through the years it has dissolved
because<00:00:33.899> of<00:00:34.020> economics<00:00:34.710> so<00:00:35.160> Elizabeth<00:00:35.550> sort

of<00:00:36.239> was<00:00:36.480> thinking<00:00:36.809> about<00:00:37.050> that<00:00:37.110> ran<00:00:37.649> with<00:00:37.860> it

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040

of was thinking about that ran with it
and<00:00:38.100> was<00:00:38.820> able<00:00:38.940> to<00:00:39.090> get<00:00:39.510> funding<00:00:39.840> to<00:00:40.320> allow<00:00:40.440> for

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
and was able to get funding to allow for

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.810 
and was able to get funding to allow for
us<00:00:41.219> to<00:00:41.489> hire<00:00:42.450> a<00:00:42.480> bus<00:00:42.750> company<00:00:43.230> to<00:00:43.920> bring<00:00:44.550> kids

us to hire a bus company to bring kids
to<00:00:44.940> the<00:00:45.090> library<00:00:45.510> and<00:00:45.719> the<00:00:46.410> idea<00:00:46.739> that<00:00:47.570> grew

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
to the library and the idea that grew

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.540 
to the library and the idea that grew
into<00:00:49.200> the<00:00:49.379> formation<00:00:49.680> of<00:00:49.950> this<00:00:50.129> bus<00:00:50.309> loss

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
into the formation of this bus loss

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.970 
into the formation of this bus loss
program<00:00:51.120> with<00:00:51.420> you<00:00:51.719> know<00:00:52.170> various<00:00:52.469> types<00:00:52.800> of

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
program with you know various types of

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.189 
program with you know various types of
jobs<00:00:53.219> and<00:00:53.579> we<00:00:53.879> do<00:00:54.030> have<00:00:54.210> a<00:00:54.300> single<00:00:54.660> parent

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
jobs and we do have a single parent

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.860 
jobs and we do have a single parent
population<00:00:56.030> sometimes<00:00:57.030> it's<00:00:57.270> difficult<00:00:57.360> for

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
population sometimes it's difficult for

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.510 
population sometimes it's difficult for
parents<00:00:58.230> to<00:00:58.469> get<00:00:58.680> their<00:00:58.739> children<00:00:59.280> to<00:00:59.309> the

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
parents to get their children to the

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.900 
parents to get their children to the
library<00:00:59.969> so<00:01:00.449> this<00:01:00.600> is<00:01:00.629> a<00:01:00.809> phenomenal<00:01:01.109> resource

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:01.910 
library so this is a phenomenal resource

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:04.490 
library so this is a phenomenal resource
this<00:01:02.910> is<00:01:03.000> just<00:01:03.120> a<00:01:03.270> few<00:01:03.480> short<00:01:03.510> years<00:01:03.809> ago<00:01:04.229> the

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
this is just a few short years ago the

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.109 
this is just a few short years ago the
previous<00:01:04.949> superintendent<00:01:05.549> was<00:01:05.670> ready<00:01:05.880> to

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
previous superintendent was ready to

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:07.910 
previous superintendent was ready to
eliminate<00:01:06.780> all<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:06.960> libraries<00:01:07.500> they<00:01:07.650> had<00:01:07.799> in

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
eliminate all the libraries they had in

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.640 
eliminate all the libraries they had in
all<00:01:08.010> the<00:01:08.100> elementary<00:01:08.640> schools<00:01:08.909> and<00:01:09.470> put<00:01:10.470> books

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
all the elementary schools and put books

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.890 
all the elementary schools and put books
in<00:01:10.799> hallways<00:01:11.280> they<00:01:11.909> save<00:01:12.210> their<00:01:12.450> libraries

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
in hallways they save their libraries

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.300 
in hallways they save their libraries
but<00:01:13.110> for<00:01:13.320> how<00:01:13.409> long<00:01:13.470> we're<00:01:13.890> not<00:01:14.040> really<00:01:14.220> sure

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
but for how long we're not really sure

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.429 
but for how long we're not really sure
so<00:01:14.760> anything<00:01:15.299> that<00:01:15.330> public<00:01:15.750> library<00:01:16.110> can<00:01:16.259> do

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
so anything that public library can do

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.620 
so anything that public library can do
to<00:01:16.979> the<00:01:17.100> Waukegan<00:01:17.580> Public<00:01:17.700> Schools<00:01:18.150> and<00:01:18.390> help

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
to the Waukegan Public Schools and help

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.350 
to the Waukegan Public Schools and help
them<00:01:18.810> out<00:01:18.930> is<00:01:19.369> why<00:01:20.369> we're<00:01:20.580> here<00:01:20.810> what<00:01:21.810> I<00:01:21.840> was

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:23.360 
them out is why we're here what I was

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.480 
them out is why we're here what I was
this<00:01:24.360> was<00:01:24.659> out<00:01:24.900> of<00:01:25.320> the<00:01:25.470> comfort<00:01:25.710> zone<00:01:25.920> for<00:01:26.369> our

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
this was out of the comfort zone for our

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.240 
this was out of the comfort zone for our
librarians<00:01:27.119> to<00:01:27.479> actually<00:01:28.020> create<00:01:28.650> curriculum

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
librarians to actually create curriculum

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.090 
librarians to actually create curriculum
and<00:01:30.060> give<00:01:30.600> it<00:01:30.720> out<00:01:30.930> to<00:01:30.960> the<00:01:31.290> children<00:01:31.740> and<00:01:31.950> they

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
and give it out to the children and they

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.499 
and give it out to the children and they
really<00:01:32.490> rose<00:01:32.729> the<00:01:32.939> occasion<00:01:33.210> I<00:01:33.240> think<00:01:33.420> they

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
really rose the occasion I think they

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.149 
really rose the occasion I think they
were<00:01:33.600> really<00:01:33.869> nervous<00:01:34.110> for<00:01:34.530> the<00:01:34.619> first<00:01:34.650> one

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
were really nervous for the first one

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.490 
were really nervous for the first one
but<00:01:36.090> they<00:01:36.240> get<00:01:36.390> so<00:01:36.570> much<00:01:36.720> energy<00:01:36.960> from<00:01:37.380> the

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
but they get so much energy from the

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.130 
but they get so much energy from the
children<00:01:37.979> and<00:01:38.189> it's<00:01:39.119> so<00:01:39.329> rewarding<00:01:39.509> that<00:01:39.869> it

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
children and it's so rewarding that it

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:40.460 
children and it's so rewarding that it
went

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
went

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.810 
went
so<00:01:41.070> well<00:01:41.340> I<00:01:41.670> think<00:01:42.030> this<00:01:42.500> exhibit<00:01:43.500> will<00:01:43.820> bring

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
so well I think this exhibit will bring

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.690 
so well I think this exhibit will bring
over<00:01:45.120> a<00:01:45.150> thousand<00:01:45.630> children<00:01:45.810> to<00:01:46.110> the<00:01:46.200> library

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700 
over a thousand children to the library

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.620 
over a thousand children to the library
these<00:01:47.700> are<00:01:47.850> kind<00:01:48.030> of<00:01:48.120> wrecks<00:01:48.330> that<00:01:48.420> you're

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
these are kind of wrecks that you're

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.530 
these are kind of wrecks that you're
going<00:01:48.750> to<00:01:48.810> find<00:01:49.020> in<00:01:49.170> your<00:01:49.260> backyard<00:01:50.150> know<00:01:51.150> the

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
going to find in your backyard know the

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.390 
going to find in your backyard know the
water<00:01:51.750> is<00:01:51.930> what<00:01:52.200> made<00:01:52.380> these<00:01:52.590> ICS<00:01:53.010> would<00:01:53.250> make

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:53.400 
water is what made these ICS would make

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.180 
water is what made these ICS would make
sure<00:01:53.700> though<00:01:53.970> what<00:01:54.810> works<00:01:55.050> very<00:01:55.320> well<00:01:55.410> is<00:01:55.860> the

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:56.190 
sure though what works very well is the

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:58.790 
sure though what works very well is the
interactivity<00:01:57.120> the<00:01:57.570> hands<00:01:57.990> on<00:01:58.140> the<00:01:58.380> kids<00:01:58.680> are

00:01:58.790 --> 00:01:58.800 
interactivity the hands on the kids are
