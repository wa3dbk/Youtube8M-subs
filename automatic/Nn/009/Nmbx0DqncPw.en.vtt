00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:56.110 
honest and again it's not a bash against
madhouse<00:03:54.859> it's<00:03:55.160> just<00:03:55.340> the<00:03:55.760> way<00:03:55.879> they<00:03:56.060> do

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:56.120 
madhouse it's just the way they do

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:00.099 
madhouse it's just the way they do
things<00:03:56.540> and<00:03:57.430> one<00:03:58.430> of<00:03:58.519> the<00:03:58.579> problems<00:03:59.060> with<00:03:59.810> that

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:00.109 
things and one of the problems with that

00:04:00.109 --> 00:04:02.770 
things and one of the problems with that
is<00:04:00.379> the<00:04:00.530> fact<00:04:00.739> that<00:04:00.889> the<00:04:01.280> battles<00:04:01.849> are<00:04:02.030> Ironman

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:02.780 
is the fact that the battles are Ironman

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:06.879 
is the fact that the battles are Ironman
battles<00:04:03.199> they're<00:04:04.359> vicious<00:04:05.359> and<00:04:05.690> brutal<00:04:06.470> and

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:06.889 
battles they're vicious and brutal and

00:04:06.889 --> 00:04:09.430 
battles they're vicious and brutal and
pretty<00:04:07.519> short<00:04:07.909> because<00:04:08.540> it's<00:04:08.690> large<00:04:09.049> robots

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:09.440 
pretty short because it's large robots

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:11.170 
pretty short because it's large robots
bashing<00:04:09.919> each<00:04:09.979> other<00:04:10.250> and<00:04:10.519> at<00:04:10.790> some<00:04:11.000> point

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:11.180 
bashing each other and at some point

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:13.420

they<00:04:11.269> get<00:04:11.389> damaged<00:04:11.780> and<00:04:12.049> then<00:04:12.680> the<00:04:12.979> fight<00:04:13.159> gets

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:13.430 
they get damaged and then the fight gets

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:15.670 
they get damaged and then the fight gets
very<00:04:13.849> you<00:04:14.269> know<00:04:14.299> overpowered<00:04:15.229> on<00:04:15.349> one<00:04:15.470> way<00:04:15.590> or
