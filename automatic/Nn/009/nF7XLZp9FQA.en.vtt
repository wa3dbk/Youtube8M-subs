when I chat online with the lady they

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.200 
when I chat online with the lady they
suggested<00:01:22.530> indeed<00:01:23.280> because<00:01:23.670> it<00:01:23.880> goes<00:01:24.000> up<00:01:24.119> to

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
suggested indeed because it goes up to

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.570 
suggested indeed because it goes up to
extra-large<00:01:24.720> and<00:01:25.170> also<00:01:25.470> you<00:01:25.890> can<00:01:26.070> adjust<00:01:26.159> the

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
extra-large and also you can adjust the

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.480 
extra-large and also you can adjust the
front<00:01:26.909> two<00:01:27.810> cups<00:01:28.170> so<00:01:28.829> you<00:01:28.979> can<00:01:29.100> kind<00:01:29.250> of<00:01:29.280> slide

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
front two cups so you can kind of slide

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:30.560 
front two cups so you can kind of slide
it<00:01:29.700> back<00:01:29.820> and<00:01:30.000> forth<00:01:30.150> and<00:01:30.210> I<00:01:30.270> thought<00:01:30.420> that

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
it back and forth and I thought that

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.060 
it back and forth and I thought that
would<00:01:30.630> be<00:01:30.689> great<00:01:30.900> but<00:01:31.200> unfortunately<00:01:31.350> when<00:01:32.009> I

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
would be great but unfortunately when I

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.969 
would be great but unfortunately when I
ordered<00:01:32.369> it<00:01:32.490> the<00:01:32.850> cups<00:01:33.150> are<00:01:33.450> quite<00:01:34.020> flat<00:01:34.439> so

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
ordered it the cups are quite flat so

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.859 
ordered it the cups are quite flat so
much<00:01:35.159> actually<00:01:35.460> doesn't<00:01:35.700> even<00:01:35.820> hold<00:01:36.119> anything

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
much actually doesn't even hold anything

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.170 
much actually doesn't even hold anything
in<00:01:37.170> place<00:01:37.470> it<00:01:37.680> just<00:01:37.860> kind<00:01:38.159> of<00:01:38.280> it's<00:01:39.000> like<00:01:39.150> a

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
in place it just kind of it's like a

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.240 
in place it just kind of it's like a
coverslip<00:01:39.630> it's<00:01:40.049> just<00:01:40.200> it<00:01:40.350> just<00:01:40.409> covers<00:01:40.770> but

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
coverslip it's just it just covers but

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.340 
coverslip it's just it just covers but
in<00:01:41.460> terms<00:01:41.759> of<00:01:41.939> what<00:01:42.479> it<00:01:42.570> looks<00:01:42.750> it's<00:01:42.960> really

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350
