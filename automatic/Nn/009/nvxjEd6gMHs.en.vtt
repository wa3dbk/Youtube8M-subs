00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:47.990 
opportunity cost of buying one GI Joe
was<00:01:45.659> the<00:01:46.259> next<00:01:46.560> best<00:01:46.740> alternative<00:01:46.950> use<00:01:47.460> of<00:01:47.670> my

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
was the next best alternative use of my

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.789 
was the next best alternative use of my
money<00:01:48.180> was<00:01:48.420> to<00:01:48.570> buy<00:01:48.689> another<00:01:48.899> one<00:01:49.079> or<00:01:49.229> Legos

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
money was to buy another one or Legos

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:53.899 
money was to buy another one or Legos
and<00:01:50.149> by<00:01:51.149> buying<00:01:51.720> one<00:01:51.899> I<00:01:52.409> blocked<00:01:53.220> myself<00:01:53.490> at

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
and by buying one I blocked myself at

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.700 
and by buying one I blocked myself at
that<00:01:53.939> moment<00:01:54.329> from<00:01:54.659> buying<00:01:54.960> the<00:01:55.170> next<00:01:55.320> item

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
that moment from buying the next item

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.740 
that moment from buying the next item
and<00:01:55.890> that's<00:01:56.460> really<00:01:56.729> what<00:01:56.939> opportunity<00:01:57.540> cost

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
and that's really what opportunity cost

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.350 
and that's really what opportunity cost
is<00:01:57.960> and<00:01:58.200> what<00:01:58.860> I<00:01:58.890> found<00:01:59.159> is<00:01:59.399> as<00:01:59.610> we<00:01:59.759> get<00:01:59.939> older

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
is and what I found is as we get older

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.530 
is and what I found is as we get older
the<00:02:01.140> zeros<00:02:01.619> start<00:02:02.490> adding<00:02:02.820> up<00:02:02.939> behind<00:02:03.420> the

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
the zeros start adding up behind the

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.830 
the zeros start adding up behind the
numbers<00:02:03.899> and<00:02:04.110> these<00:02:04.619> these<00:02:05.070> opportunities

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 
numbers and these these opportunities

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.570 
numbers and these these opportunities
man<00:02:06.840> you're<00:02:07.229> making<00:02:07.560> much<00:02:07.770> greater<00:02:08.039> decision
