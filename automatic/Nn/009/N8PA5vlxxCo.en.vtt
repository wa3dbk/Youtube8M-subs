00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:30.839
 hello to all guys from tim and then 62 and 

00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:34.629
 today we see another part of the video 

00:00:30.839 --> 00:00:37.839
 of the best apps for ipad 

00:00:34.629 --> 00:00:40.059
 the first application is now called two 

00:00:37.839 --> 00:00:43.449
 lessons and is very useful especially for 

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:45.879
 in fact, who is a student is free and there 

00:00:43.449 --> 00:00:50.320
 allows you to organize the hours and hours 

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:53.260
 lessons that take place for example of 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:56.229
 Monday you can set the start time 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:57.159
 up to a maximum of 12 hours and with each 

00:00:56.229 --> 00:00:59.890
 matter 

00:00:57.159 --> 00:01:01.720
 you can choose a color to have 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:03.820
 good table like this 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:06.970
 looking on this button above 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:09.159
 we can send you the table ad 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:12.119
 example to a friend of ours in the 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:15.220
 little box under our apps we find 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:19.240
 two applications always developed there 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:22.899
 from the same house we say that they are ai 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:23.740
 mortgage installment and f24 tax codes I do not 

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:26.200
 I got it 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:29.050
 so I can't get him to review another 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:33.729
 application quarry paper helper and 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:37.840
 a very good and good text editing 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:41.290
 i have to say is keep his right to a 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:44.260
 browser that can then be removed and can 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:46.060
 then being removed if we don't need it is a lot 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:49.180
 useful this application especially if 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:51.370
 so we are on a website 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:54.940
 we want to take notes on 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:58.540
 things therefore for above all to study 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:02:00.909
 may be this is in text dating 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:04.310
 word type or quite good so if 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:06.979
 admit central writing to the side 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:11.660
 we can change color when 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:15.140
 we write we are all one dream 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:17.480
 beautiful application that we find 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:20.900
 this should be paid not 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:28.040
 I remember then the other application yes 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:30.620
 call clean tech li name for hd and ci 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:33.380
 lets you see the inclinations in 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:35.569
 based on the inclination allows us 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:39.680
 let's say it makes us see on the level 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:42.739
 I can't show you how 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:46.600
 it moves however it is net already supporting it 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:51.440
 in this way you see that it levels it 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:54.470
 so let's say phone and documentation 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:58.220
 I still don't understand what is being done 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:03:02.090
 however you can carib or mimic it 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:04.340
 calibrate is the level and there are all 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:07.370
 the settings also on the colors then 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:12.410
 to change the level the color of the 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:14.660
 the four levels and various other things 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:17.630
 toles hd and in other applications always 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:19.730
 free that allows us to have 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:20.569
 four tools in one 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:25.430
 application 

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:29.989
 the jewel the first one I have to say a lot 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:35.600
 useful if we can't choose between 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:37.519
 so many colors then wait until I don't know 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:44.829
 how to get back then more a 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:44.829
 moment the application sorry I'm keeping 

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:50.010
 then we have a torch that I am 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:53.310
 only colors and us only 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:04:00.930
 of colors, however, for someone you find 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:04:04.920
 torch that is, above all there is the 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:11.700
 level that allows us to national 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:14.300
 how the plan is touched and we have the 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:16.200
 timer that can be useful for measuring 

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:18.660
 something 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:20.989
 time for something that ebay to do 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:20.989
 something 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:26.010
 the other application is called mobile 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:28.380
 notes is free and allows us to 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:32.100
 write notes and I have to say it's a lot 

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:34.800
 more beautiful than we say the notes 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:37.080
 that we already have in the episode of the 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:39.360
 ipad is much more beautiful indeed we can 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:42.390
 also add pictures 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:44.760
 by accessing our gallery 

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:47.850
 here we can then delete the notes 

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:52.530
 add various notes 

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:56.210
 here we have on the left all the notes here 

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:59.490
 instead we return to the main menu 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:02.730
 by clicking here you are synchronized 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:05.720
 so you can connect here in the 

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:10.180
 settings you can change 

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:14.030
 at your leisure and quick start guide 

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:20.780
 this part if i get a little like 

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:23.720
 it works the app let's say we can 

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:25.720
 say also avoid notes and everything 

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:28.820
 how much 

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:32.780
 the last application is called euronics 

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:35.750
 well i think we all know the shops 

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:38.060

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:42.800

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:46.150

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:49.850
 always downloadable because obviously 

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:52.850
 then we choose the location then 

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:56.270
 we can read the flyer in the news 

00:05:52.850 --> 00:06:01.430
