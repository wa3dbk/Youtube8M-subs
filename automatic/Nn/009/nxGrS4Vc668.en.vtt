00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:31.750 
reason I bought this lock I figured I

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:32.850 
reason I bought this lock I figured I
could<00:01:31.780> clean<00:01:32.020> it<00:01:32.049> up<00:01:32.229> a<00:01:32.320> little<00:01:32.409> bit<00:01:32.680> and

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:32.860 
could clean it up a little bit and

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:35.219 
could clean it up a little bit and
replace<00:01:33.700> this<00:01:33.939> core<00:01:34.270> in<00:01:34.420> fact<00:01:34.600> I<00:01:34.689> have<00:01:34.840> removed

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:35.229 
replace this core in fact I have removed

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:37.770 
replace this core in fact I have removed
the<00:01:35.439> core<00:01:35.710> I<00:01:35.890> have<00:01:36.070> not<00:01:36.220> picked<00:01:36.430> the<00:01:36.610> lock<00:01:36.790> but

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:37.780 
the core I have not picked the lock but

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:40.260 
the core I have not picked the lock but
I<00:01:37.810> did<00:01:38.110> remove<00:01:38.380> the<00:01:38.500> core<00:01:38.740> I<00:01:39.130> did<00:01:39.700> open<00:01:40.000> it<00:01:40.119> to

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.270 
I did remove the core I did open it to

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:42.210 
I did remove the core I did open it to
make<00:01:40.450> sure<00:01:40.570> I<00:01:40.600> could<00:01:40.720> remove<00:01:41.170> the<00:01:41.350> core<00:01:41.560> so

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:42.220 
make sure I could remove the core so

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:43.590

it's<00:02:32.980> the<00:02:33.130> curved<00:02:33.520> flag<00:02:35.340> because<00:02:36.340> I<00:02:36.430> need<00:02:36.640> to

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
it's the curved flag because I need to

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.880 
it's the curved flag because I need to
go<00:02:36.940> around<00:02:37.090> these<00:02:37.480> little<00:02:37.660> and<00:02:38.470> get<00:02:38.590> this<00:02:38.739> up

here if I can get it I need to go around

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:42.330 
here if I can get it I need to go around
this<00:02:40.269> too<00:02:40.450> little<00:02:40.630> mounds<00:02:41.050> that<00:02:41.110> the<00:02:41.349> pins<00:02:42.190> are

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
this too little mounds that the pins are

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:45.449 
this too little mounds that the pins are
hiding<00:02:42.670> behind<00:02:42.959> so<00:02:43.959> a<00:02:44.230> little<00:02:45.069> bit<00:02:45.160> of<00:02:45.250> tension

just<00:02:45.940> like<00:02:46.120> all<00:02:46.360> dimple<00:02:46.690> locks<00:02:46.900> start<00:02:47.830> from

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
just like all dimple locks start from

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:49.860 
just like all dimple locks start from
the<00:02:48.069> front<00:02:48.220> and<00:02:48.519> just<00:02:48.940> go<00:02:49.180> from<00:02:49.300> front<00:02:49.569> we<00:02:49.780> are

handy<00:03:42.049> what<00:03:42.890> we're<00:03:43.010> going<00:03:43.129> to<00:03:43.159> do<00:03:43.310> is<00:03:43.430> just

00:03:43.539 --> 00:03:43.549 
handy what we're going to do is just

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:48.720 
handy what we're going to do is just
take<00:03:43.730> that<00:03:43.879> baby<00:03:44.120> right<00:03:44.209> out<00:03:44.390> of<00:03:44.540> there<00:03:44.750> and

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:48.730 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:51.699 

our<00:03:49.730> core<00:03:49.940> falls<00:03:50.239> out<00:03:50.480> and<00:03:50.690> you<00:03:50.810> can<00:03:50.959> see<00:03:51.170> it<00:03:51.409> is

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:51.709 
our core falls out and you can see it is

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:54.879 
our core falls out and you can see it is
indeed<00:03:52.129> a<00:03:52.370> very<00:03:52.599> cheaply<00:03:53.889> manufactured

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:54.889 
indeed a very cheaply manufactured

00:03:54.889 --> 00:03:58.089 
indeed a very cheaply manufactured
Chinese<00:03:55.700> core<00:03:56.120> it<00:03:56.389> looks<00:03:56.540> like<00:03:56.659> a<00:03:56.690> cast<00:03:57.109> body

00:03:58.089 --> 00:03:58.099 
Chinese core it looks like a cast body

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:00.729 
Chinese core it looks like a cast body
the<00:03:58.459> only<00:03:58.489> finished<00:03:59.090> part<00:03:59.359> is<00:03:59.629> right<00:04:00.349> here<00:04:00.590> on

00:04:00.729 --> 00:04:00.739 
the only finished part is right here on

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:03.610 
the only finished part is right here on
the<00:04:00.859> front<00:04:01.010> well<00:04:01.790> I<00:04:02.329> did<00:04:02.840> notice<00:04:03.049> earlier<00:04:03.440> when

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:03.620 
the front well I did notice earlier when

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:05.830 
the front well I did notice earlier when
I<00:04:03.650> took<00:04:03.769> it<00:04:03.950> apart<00:04:04.190> the<00:04:04.340> actuator<00:04:04.849> pop<00:04:05.690> this

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:05.840 
I took it apart the actuator pop this

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:11.289 
I took it apart the actuator pop this
out<00:04:06.819> is<00:04:07.819> very<00:04:08.209> poorly<00:04:08.829> manufactured<00:04:10.150> you<00:04:11.150> can

00:04:11.289 --> 00:04:11.299 
out is very poorly manufactured you can

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:12.939 
out is very poorly manufactured you can
see<00:04:11.450> some<00:04:11.659> rough<00:04:11.870> machining<00:04:12.079> on<00:04:12.530> there<00:04:12.769> I

00:04:12.939 --> 00:04:12.949 
see some rough machining on there I

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:15.099 
see some rough machining on there I
think<00:04:13.760> I'll<00:04:14.150> probably<00:04:14.269> have<00:04:14.569> to<00:04:14.599> make<00:04:14.720> a<00:04:14.870> new

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:15.109 
think I'll probably have to make a new

00:04:15.109 --> 00:04:16.810 
think I'll probably have to make a new
actuator<00:04:15.680> I<00:04:15.799> don't<00:04:15.949> really<00:04:16.070> trust<00:04:16.370> this<00:04:16.609> one

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:16.820 
actuator I don't really trust this one

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:18.879 
actuator I don't really trust this one
but<00:04:17.209> anyway<00:04:17.479> I<00:04:17.660> will<00:04:18.109> put<00:04:18.260> it<00:04:18.349> together<00:04:18.440> with<00:04:18.859> a

00:04:18.879 --> 00:04:18.889 
but anyway I will put it together with a

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:22.180 
but anyway I will put it together with a
brand<00:04:19.310> new<00:04:19.519> 6<00:04:19.849> pin<00:04:20.180> core<00:04:20.660> not<00:04:21.349> a<00:04:21.560> Chinese<00:04:21.979> one

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:22.190 
brand new 6 pin core not a Chinese one

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:23.170 
brand new 6 pin core not a Chinese one
I'll<00:04:22.340> come<00:04:22.490> up<00:04:22.610> with<00:04:22.729> something<00:04:22.970> like<00:04:23.000> an

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:23.180 
I'll come up with something like an
