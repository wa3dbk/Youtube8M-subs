00:00:04.609 --> 00:00:09.120
 we are at the company of this 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.920
 partnership course too long I am you 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.889
 used cage tract 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:17.330
 no we have been in partnership for 15 years 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:19.430
 taken from my father and 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:23.210
 we are the first to grow in quota and 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:25.130
 we have it in all directions in 2015 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:28.099
 made plans a long time ago 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:29.360
 for new construction first 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:31.849
 first trajectory where his piece at the 

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:33.620
 steel but coming further and further 

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:35.660
 So we opted for the 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:37.460
 construction of a complete jet 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:39.440
 initially we thought there 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:41.809
 to start a new milking stall 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.610
 with progressive insight and good 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:46.220
 we are counting that work 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:47.059
 choice that is best for 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:50.420
 us under with 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:52.460
 vms and get started 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:54.430
 found the same after a major investigation 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:57.909
 we finally chose it 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:01:00.500
 for the telephone phone has one 

00:00:57.909 --> 00:01:04.309
 nice cow friendly 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:06.770
 where nice dairy machine with namely 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:08.990
 for job and it appeals to me very much 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:10.340
 a natural way of playing football and 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:12.440
 what i what i now after two months 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:14.840
 robotic milking see is that they are the 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:16.010
 let the flowing milk shoot well 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.159
 by then I waste too many 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:21.620
 confidence in it innovation 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:23.120
 for example the hut name likete de comes 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:25.640
 the kind accounted for the mellow on it 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:27.560
 for the cow for the future 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:29.380
 we looked and looked into the 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.869
 in the maintenance contracts and 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:34.210
 we all have the different ones 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:35.110
 passed on and then we opt for it 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:36.700
 c contract 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:39.130
 because that creates a lot of clarity and then 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:41.740
 do you know exactly on time what 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:43.929
 your hair costs are in addition to the 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:46.369
 We have the milking robots 

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:49.219
 scratches and the water bowl and 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:51.799
 also from waste and the dhc 

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:54.439
 that is the cock steering cast of both 

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:56.179
 the light and if the curtains the the 

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:58.880
 lights are dimmable they are LED lights 

00:01:56.179 --> 00:02:00.890
 and the curtains are controlled by 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.929
 sensors in the beam and that combination 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:05.119
 with the weather station him 

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:08.020
 Total packages is what they call the 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:08.020
 blue beam 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.840
 well quite long we have been thinking and 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.660
 have milked in and all new ones 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:21.340
 There are milking parlors that now show that 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:24.190
 have chosen another milking robot it is 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:26.230
 a huge piece of labor obligation 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:27.970
 we now also see that was family without 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:30.430
 many more cows without external help 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:31.630
 can milk and moreover it is seen after 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:33.430
 2015 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:35.590
 We think we have huge milk production 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:37.720
 can increase with more milk and 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:39.430
 this is a very social system point 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:42.420
 for the where the whole family did not like him 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:42.420
 can easily save 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.819
 in 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.459
 we are over two months ago 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:53.670
 booted up well that's scary look there 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:55.019
 you have a huge head start 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.459
 first it starts with the 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:59.220
 the cows move out 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:00.209
 older steel to the new style well up 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:02.310
 Tuesday morning 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:03.870
 are they are we have them to new ones 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:05.819
 style hunted they are the two three 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:09.630
 so there is a run around 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:11.700
 the fences were placed and then 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:14.640
 they dogs started milking him in it 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:17.250
 brought it with her in milk and arrived 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.970
 four people from lava further were none 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:21.150
 people needed 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:22.110
 yes we ourselves 100 but not grain 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.549
 to teach me 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:26.760
 there and it is a very intensive one 

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:28.260
 bye because it comes to you a lot 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.329
 at the end of the day then the 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.819
 new people so that we will be there 

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:34.170
 You hold your peace 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:35.519
 Monday then you have to do it yourself during the day 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:36.660
 wider 

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:38.519
 first you think we have those cows 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:40.410
 all equally rinrin flowers that too 

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:41.880
 was not so bad with a bit 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:46.230
 guidance is easy to stack 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:47.849
 in our case it has been better than expected 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:51.269
 well we are more than two months back 

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:54.780
 started up with a 25 liter daily run of 

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:56.910
 from the old box language and after more than one 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:59.549
 week we already had 28 liters and that is there 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:02.100
 what is almost 30 liters of cool is that 

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:04.410
 that by now we have chosen increased 

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:06.120
 for a corner arrangement 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:08.310
 this first robot can be the cows and such 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:10.950
 from you between the boxes 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:12.660
 the right to walk in and the others out 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:14.760
 it from the square 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:16.769
 were spacious square opted for one 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:19.590
 for good accessibility of the 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:21.060
 of the milking robot behind the robot space 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:24.530
 we have to order different 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:24.530
 separation options 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:38.469
 we have a tonometer on the robot ourselves 

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:40.569
 and they have 3 confidence every day 

00:04:38.469 --> 00:04:43.389
 and we the great health 

00:04:40.569 --> 00:04:46.449
 cell count has also fallen 

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:49.360
 since the start of the 

00:04:46.449 --> 00:04:51.840
 You can see the milk flow aroma here 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:55.680
 that I cows my head 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:55.680
 185 witzel tell me once 

00:04:56.289 --> 00:05:01.749
 and where the phase is the average 

00:05:00.789 --> 00:05:06.969
 suicide 

00:05:01.749 --> 00:05:09.039
 87 now after more than 2 jobs than robotic milking 

00:05:06.969 --> 00:05:10.869
 we see that it is a very nice laid-back 

00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:12.189
 way of milk 

00:05:10.869 --> 00:05:14.800
 we had expected a year there 

00:05:12.189 --> 00:05:16.509
 I have been practicing for over two months 

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:18.189
 we of well as far as we are concerned it is one 

00:05:16.509 --> 00:05:22.270
 story has been there actually it is 

00:05:18.189 --> 00:05:24.869
 now just wait for 2015 so we still 

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:24.869
 further expand
