00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.320
 I woke up late for them 

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:15.880
 but early for me 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:18.420
 the clothes change and the words 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:21.780
 they make sense to me 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.620
 1-2-3, time to run 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:27.660
 free by land and park 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.440
 19-20-21-23 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.220
 to classify his head 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:36.140
 31-30-35-36 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.900
 what you did begins to join 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.580
 40-50 maybe 66 

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:44.660
 tired of the rest of you talking to you 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:48.080
 I know, that one day I will arrive 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.080
 where nobody was 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:54.200
 will be suddenly, falling night 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.640
 I will not let anyone know 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.480
 and I know I will be 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:02.580
 where nobody else 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:06.380
 will be suddenly, falling night and no one will warn you 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.500
 I never heard the starting whistle 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.300
 but little by little I began to notice 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:15.220
 to several dead on the road 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.260
 others kill themselves by fitting 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:20.940
 1-2-3 draws on a paper 

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:24.180
 what you want to be when big 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.860
 19-20-21-23 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:29.840
 select what you reach 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.260
 31-35-36 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:35.340
 friendship is not what it used to be 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.020
 40-50 maybe 66 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:41.020
 when hatred is over 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.480
 I know, that one day I will arrive 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.180
 where nobody was 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:50.680
 will be suddenly, falling night 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.700
 I will not let anyone know 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.380
 and I know I will be 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.960
 where nobody else 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.060
 will be suddenly, falling night 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.020
 I will not let anyone know 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:31.840
 for them I am before zero because I never wanted to play their game 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:37.340
 they no longer dream, they are just sleeping. 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:43.160
 they exchanged heart for the brain they thought they did the right thing 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:48.480
 they no longer dream, they are just sleeping. 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:54.520
 for them I am before zero because I never wanted to play their game 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:59.580
 they no longer dream, they are just sleeping 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:05.760
 they exchanged heart for the brain they thought they did the right thing 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:10.940
 they no longer dream, they are just sleeping 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:15.260
 I know, that one day I will arrive 

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:17.860
 where nobody was 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:21.020
 will be suddenly, falling night 

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:23.320
 I will not let anyone know 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:26.500
 and I know, I'll be 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.400
 where nobody else 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:33.240
 will be suddenly, falling night and no one will warn you 

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:35.480
 I woke up late for them
