00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
new build for this build I'll be using

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.919 
new build for this build I'll be using
the<00:00:12.300> QA<00:00:12.599> v<00:00:12.690> 400<00:00:13.650> frame<00:00:14.460> from<00:00:14.880> fpv<00:00:15.480> manuals

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:17.810 
the QA v 400 frame from fpv manuals
reason<00:00:16.619> I<00:00:16.710> decided<00:00:17.070> to<00:00:17.130> go<00:00:17.190> with<00:00:17.369> this<00:00:17.520> frame

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
reason I decided to go with this frame

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.620 
reason I decided to go with this frame
is<00:00:18.090> the<00:00:18.240> jello<00:00:18.600> free<00:00:19.220> video<00:00:20.220> so<00:00:20.970> basically<00:00:21.449> if

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
is the jello free video so basically if

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.179 
is the jello free video so basically if
you're<00:00:21.750> looking<00:00:21.990> for<00:00:22.140> a<00:00:22.170> quadcopter<00:00:22.410> that'll

can<00:00:26.369> go<00:00:26.490> with<00:00:26.609> the<00:00:26.730> QA<00:00:27.000> v<00:00:27.029> 500<00:00:27.779> I've<00:00:27.930> used<00:00:28.199> both

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
can go with the QA v 500 I've used both

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.189 
can go with the QA v 500 I've used both
and<00:00:28.859> I<00:00:29.609> really<00:00:30.119> like<00:00:30.300> the<00:00:30.420> performance<00:00:31.019> in

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
and I really like the performance in

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.200 
and I really like the performance in
both<00:00:31.380> quad<00:00:31.769> copters<00:00:32.250> really<00:00:32.820> like<00:00:33.000> this

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
both quad copters really like this

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.389 
both quad copters really like this
because<00:00:33.540> it's<00:00:33.719> a<00:00:33.840> compact<00:00:34.440> size<00:00:34.649> easy<00:00:35.219> to

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
because it's a compact size easy to

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.030 
because it's a compact size easy to
carry<00:00:36.020> for<00:00:37.020> this<00:00:37.140> build<00:00:37.380> I<00:00:37.530> decided<00:00:37.559> to<00:00:37.980> use

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
carry for this build I decided to use

from<00:01:15.840> Hobby<00:01:16.200> King<00:01:16.909> really<00:01:17.909> good<00:01:18.060> battery<00:01:18.450> I

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
from Hobby King really good battery I

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.859 
from Hobby King really good battery I
think<00:01:18.930> this<00:01:19.170> battery<00:01:19.560> should<00:01:19.799> put<00:01:20.009> up<00:01:20.689> and<00:01:21.689> a

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
think this battery should put up and a

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.510 
think this battery should put up and a
lot<00:01:22.229> of<00:01:22.290> power<00:01:22.619> for<00:01:22.799> these<00:01:23.009> little<00:01:23.340> motors

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
lot of power for these little motors

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.990 
lot of power for these little motors
