hey<00:00:00.480> guys<00:00:00.659> how's<00:00:00.900> it<00:00:00.930> going<00:00:01.170> so<00:00:02.100> I<00:00:02.429> haven't

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:02.850 
hey guys how's it going so I haven't

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:05.059 
hey guys how's it going so I haven't
made<00:00:03.000> anything<00:00:03.270> on<00:00:03.600> the<00:00:04.290> quarry<00:00:04.650> for

00:00:05.059 --> 00:00:05.069 
made anything on the quarry for

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:07.130 
made anything on the quarry for
Minecraft<00:00:05.580> just<00:00:06.089> any<00:00:06.240> videos<00:00:06.569> about<00:00:06.810> it<00:00:06.930> for<00:00:07.109> a

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.140 
Minecraft just any videos about it for a

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.000 
Minecraft just any videos about it for a
long<00:00:07.350> time<00:00:08.990> so<00:00:09.990> I<00:00:10.260> guess<00:00:10.469> I<00:00:10.590> wanted<00:00:10.830> to<00:00:10.920> just

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
long time so I guess I wanted to just

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.160 
long time so I guess I wanted to just
take<00:00:11.460> a<00:00:11.519> second<00:00:12.330> actually<00:00:12.809> like<00:00:12.929> talked<00:00:13.139> about

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
take a second actually like talked about

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.010 
take a second actually like talked about
like<00:00:13.410> what<00:00:13.920> is<00:00:14.219> preventing<00:00:14.880> the<00:00:15.420> quarry<00:00:15.690> from

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
like what is preventing the quarry from

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.550 
like what is preventing the quarry from
being<00:00:16.260> a<00:00:16.410> thing<00:00:16.590> and<00:00:18.170> yeah<00:00:19.170> I<00:00:19.199> just<00:00:19.289> kind<00:00:19.500> of

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
being a thing and yeah I just kind of

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.099 
being a thing and yeah I just kind of
let<00:00:19.740> you<00:00:19.830> guys<00:00:20.010> know<00:00:20.760> what's<00:00:21.330> going<00:00:21.630> on<00:00:21.720> since

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
let you guys know what's going on since

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.859 
let you guys know what's going on since
that<00:00:22.410> was<00:00:23.400> like<00:00:23.580> at<00:00:24.180> one<00:00:24.359> point<00:00:24.510> that<00:00:24.660> was<00:00:24.750> like

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
that was like at one point that was like

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:26.269 
that was like at one point that was like
three<00:00:25.109> fourths<00:00:25.410> of<00:00:25.410> the<00:00:25.529> videos<00:00:25.859> I<00:00:26.010> put<00:00:26.189> out

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
three fourths of the videos I put out

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:27.259 
three fourths of the videos I put out
we're<00:00:26.430> about<00:00:26.460> this<00:00:26.760> thing<00:00:26.910> and<00:00:27.029> that<00:00:27.150> I<00:00:27.180> just

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
we're about this thing and that I just

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.349 
we're about this thing and that I just
kind<00:00:27.630> of<00:00:27.750> stopped<00:00:28.849> but<00:00:29.849> one<00:00:30.000> of<00:00:30.119> the<00:00:30.210> main

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
kind of stopped but one of the main

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.010 
kind of stopped but one of the main
problems<00:00:30.470> with<00:00:31.470> the<00:00:31.590> quarry<00:00:31.859> is<00:00:32.480> I'll<00:00:33.480> explain

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
problems with the quarry is I'll explain

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.900 
problems with the quarry is I'll explain
why<00:00:34.260> you<00:00:34.320> need<00:00:34.590> a<00:00:34.620> clock<00:00:35.070> later<00:00:35.370> but<00:00:35.610> you<00:00:35.640> need

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
why you need a clock later but you need

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.810 
why you need a clock later but you need
a<00:00:35.940> redstone<00:00:36.680> clock<00:00:37.680> and<00:00:38.129> you<00:00:38.640> know<00:00:38.730> the

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
a redstone clock and you know the

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.340 
a redstone clock and you know the
classic<00:00:39.180> clock<00:00:39.360> is<00:00:39.510> just<00:00:39.719> this<00:00:39.840> too<00:00:40.110> sticky

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
classic clock is just this too sticky

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.020 
classic clock is just this too sticky
pistons<00:00:40.860> facing<00:00:41.250> into<00:00:41.489> each<00:00:41.579> other<00:00:41.760> like<00:00:42.000> that

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
pistons facing into each other like that

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.660 
pistons facing into each other like that
and<00:00:42.620> what<00:00:43.620> we<00:00:43.739> can<00:00:43.890> do<00:00:44.010> is<00:00:44.100> you<00:00:44.219> have<00:00:44.250> put<00:00:44.489> like

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
and what we can do is you have put like

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:51.110 
and what we can do is you have put like
a<00:00:45.800> piston<00:00:46.800> there<00:00:47.010> and<00:00:48.020> now<00:00:49.020> we<00:00:49.079> have<00:00:49.309> a<00:00:50.309> simple

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
a piston there and now we have a simple

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.869 
a piston there and now we have a simple
redstone<00:00:51.570> clock<00:00:51.660> like<00:00:51.930> on<00:00:52.110> and<00:00:52.230> off<00:00:52.670> and<00:00:53.670> needs

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
redstone clock like on and off and needs

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.700 
redstone clock like on and off and needs
to<00:00:54.000> be<00:00:54.090> made<00:00:54.329> out<00:00:54.360> of<00:00:54.539> slime<00:00:54.930> blocks<00:00:55.199> redstone

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
to be made out of slime blocks redstone

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.470 
to be made out of slime blocks redstone
blocks<00:00:55.949> and<00:00:56.219> pistons<00:00:56.699> because<00:00:56.969> it<00:00:57.090> needs<00:00:57.270> to

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
blocks and pistons because it needs to

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.500 
blocks and pistons because it needs to
be<00:00:57.570> possible<00:00:58.340> the<00:00:59.340> clock<00:00:59.550> is<00:00:59.730> used<00:00:59.969> to<00:01:00.149> make<00:01:00.300> a

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
be possible the clock is used to make a

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.149 
be possible the clock is used to make a
conveyor<00:01:01.050> belt<00:01:01.170> for<00:01:01.829> the<00:01:02.539> for<00:01:03.539> the<00:01:03.570> quarry

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:04.159 
conveyor belt for the for the quarry

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:06.740 
conveyor belt for the for the quarry
that<00:01:05.159> you<00:01:05.400> could<00:01:05.610> theoretically<00:01:05.820> make<00:01:06.450> Cory

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
that you could theoretically make Cory

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.630 
that you could theoretically make Cory
without<00:01:07.049> a<00:01:07.080> conveyor<00:01:07.380> belt<00:01:07.500> but<00:01:07.830> just<00:01:08.010> it's

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
without a conveyor belt but just it's

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.750 
without a conveyor belt but just it's
much<00:01:08.970> easier<00:01:09.000> to<00:01:09.720> you<00:01:10.470> have<00:01:10.680> a<00:01:10.710> conveyor<00:01:11.670> belt

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
much easier to you have a conveyor belt

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.250 
much easier to you have a conveyor belt
which<00:01:12.060> means<00:01:12.360> you<00:01:12.540> need<00:01:12.689> a<00:01:12.750> push<00:01:12.990> to<00:01:13.110> bowl

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
which means you need a push to bowl

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.380 
which means you need a push to bowl
clock<00:01:13.530> now<00:01:14.250> I've<00:01:14.400> made<00:01:14.580> a<00:01:14.610> possible<00:01:15.000> clock<00:01:15.210> and

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
clock now I've made a possible clock and

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.510 
clock now I've made a possible clock and
I've<00:01:15.479> made<00:01:15.630> a<00:01:15.659> possible<00:01:16.140> a<00:01:16.229> conveyor<00:01:16.560> belt<00:01:16.680> but

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
I've made a possible a conveyor belt but

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.130 
I've made a possible a conveyor belt but
the<00:01:17.640> problem<00:01:17.970> is<00:01:18.090> my<00:01:18.240> conveyor<00:01:18.540> belts<00:01:18.869> can't

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
the problem is my conveyor belts can't

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.530 
the problem is my conveyor belts can't
turn<00:01:19.409> off<00:01:19.619> and<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:20.820> reason<00:01:20.970> that's<00:01:21.180> a<00:01:21.330> problem

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
turn off and the reason that's a problem

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.649 
turn off and the reason that's a problem
is<00:01:21.840> this<00:01:22.619> we'll<00:01:23.520> see<00:01:23.670> if<00:01:23.700> we<00:01:23.880> can<00:01:24.030> catch<00:01:24.270> a

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
is this we'll see if we can catch a

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.190 
is this we'll see if we can catch a
piston<00:01:25.259> breaking<00:01:26.509> yeah<00:01:27.509> there<00:01:27.689> we<00:01:27.780> go<00:01:27.810> look<00:01:28.140> at

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
piston breaking yeah there we go look at

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.840 
piston breaking yeah there we go look at
this<00:01:28.729> well<00:01:29.729> looks<00:01:30.360> like<00:01:30.450> yeah<00:01:31.020> 3<00:01:31.290> out<00:01:31.380> of<00:01:31.409> the

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:31.850 
this well looks like yeah 3 out of the

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:34.760 
this well looks like yeah 3 out of the
seven<00:01:32.850> clocks<00:01:33.119> here<00:01:33.299> just<00:01:33.540> stopped<00:01:34.439> working

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
seven clocks here just stopped working

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.350 
seven clocks here just stopped working
just<00:01:35.520> completely<00:01:36.560> and<00:01:37.759> if<00:01:38.759> I<00:01:38.850> keep<00:01:39.090> logging

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
just completely and if I keep logging

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.510 
just completely and if I keep logging
and<00:01:39.570> we<00:01:39.750> may<00:01:39.960> hopefully<00:01:40.740> we'll<00:01:41.130> get<00:01:41.250> the<00:01:41.310> next

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
and we may hopefully we'll get the next

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.490 
and we may hopefully we'll get the next
thing<00:01:41.970> that<00:01:42.180> looks<00:01:42.869> like<00:01:42.960> they<00:01:43.140> all<00:01:43.229> stopped

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
thing that looks like they all stopped

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.230 
thing that looks like they all stopped
working<00:01:43.829> but<00:01:44.009> sometimes<00:01:44.549> what<00:01:44.790> happens<00:01:44.820> is

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
working but sometimes what happens is

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.179 
working but sometimes what happens is
the<00:01:45.780> piston<00:01:46.200> will<00:01:46.380> become<00:01:46.649> permanently

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
the piston will become permanently

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.850 
the piston will become permanently
extended<00:01:48.090> or<00:01:48.329> extended<00:01:49.140> and<00:01:49.259> retract<00:01:49.619> at<00:01:49.770> the

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
extended or extended and retract at the

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.429 
extended or extended and retract at the
same<00:01:50.040> time<00:01:50.220> it's<00:01:50.460> a<00:01:50.670> weird<00:01:50.909> bug<00:01:51.290> if<00:01:52.290> you've

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
same time it's a weird bug if you've

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.200 
same time it's a weird bug if you've
worked<00:01:52.680> with<00:01:52.829> pistons<00:01:53.280> and<00:01:53.399> close<00:01:53.820> your<00:01:53.850> world

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
worked with pistons and close your world

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.749 
worked with pistons and close your world
you<00:01:54.420> know<00:01:54.750> it<00:01:54.899> is<00:01:55.020> but<00:01:55.259> so<00:01:55.590> the<00:01:56.159> issue<00:01:56.340> here

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
you know it is but so the issue here

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.459 
you know it is but so the issue here
that<00:01:56.820> I'm<00:01:57.119> trying<00:01:57.570> to<00:01:57.659> get<00:01:57.869> across<00:01:57.990> with<00:01:58.380> all

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
that I'm trying to get across with all

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:02.810 
that I'm trying to get across with all
this<00:01:58.649> is<00:01:58.799> that<00:02:00.380> the<00:02:01.380> clocks<00:02:01.680> are<00:02:01.920> unstable

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
this is that the clocks are unstable

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.359 
this is that the clocks are unstable
which<00:02:03.780> means<00:02:04.110> a<00:02:04.439> conveyor<00:02:04.829> belt<00:02:04.920> would<00:02:05.219> be

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
which means a conveyor belt would be

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.639 
which means a conveyor belt would be
would<00:02:05.850> be<00:02:05.880> very<00:02:06.180> unstable<00:02:06.600> and<00:02:06.960> break<00:02:07.290> if<00:02:07.590> you

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
would be very unstable and break if you

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:10.219 
would be very unstable and break if you
saved<00:02:08.129> and<00:02:08.340> exit<00:02:08.640> the<00:02:08.670> world<00:02:08.970> so<00:02:09.750> if<00:02:09.899> you<00:02:09.989> had<00:02:10.200> a

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
saved and exit the world so if you had a

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.170 
saved and exit the world so if you had a
conveyor<00:02:10.560> belt<00:02:10.679> you<00:02:11.550> would<00:02:11.700> need<00:02:11.849> to<00:02:11.910> be<00:02:12.090> able

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
conveyor belt you would need to be able

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.630 
conveyor belt you would need to be able
to<00:02:12.390> turn<00:02:12.540> it<00:02:12.599> off<00:02:12.780> somehow

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
to turn it off somehow

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.309 
to turn it off somehow
and<00:02:13.730> that<00:02:14.510> also<00:02:14.720> means<00:02:15.080> you<00:02:15.200> know<00:02:15.260> I'm

00:02:15.309 --> 00:02:15.319 
and that also means you know I'm

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:19.320 
and that also means you know I'm
constantly<00:02:15.800> monitoring<00:02:16.490> the<00:02:17.650> the<00:02:18.650> quarry<00:02:18.950> and

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
constantly monitoring the the quarry and

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:21.550 
constantly monitoring the the quarry and
having<00:02:20.330> some<00:02:20.600> way<00:02:20.810> to<00:02:20.870> turn<00:02:21.140> off<00:02:21.319> all<00:02:21.530> the

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
having some way to turn off all the

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.800 
having some way to turn off all the
conveyor<00:02:21.980> belts<00:02:22.340> in<00:02:22.490> it<00:02:22.640> from<00:02:22.850> a<00:02:23.030> remote

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
conveyor belts in it from a remote

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:25.540 
conveyor belts in it from a remote
location<00:02:23.870> or<00:02:24.620> go<00:02:24.950> through<00:02:25.160> all<00:02:25.280> the<00:02:25.430> different

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:25.550 
location or go through all the different

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:27.660 
location or go through all the different
convertibles<00:02:26.270> into<00:02:26.390> the<00:02:26.660> moth<00:02:26.840> individually

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
convertibles into the moth individually

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:29.949 
convertibles into the moth individually
so<00:02:28.670> then<00:02:28.790> just<00:02:28.940> write<00:02:29.150> down<00:02:29.180> you<00:02:29.450> the<00:02:29.720> four

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:29.959 
so then just write down you the four

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:32.350 
so then just write down you the four
kind<00:02:30.290> of<00:02:30.440> things<00:02:31.400> that<00:02:31.730> are<00:02:31.850> preventing<00:02:32.120> me

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360 
kind of things that are preventing me

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.810 
kind of things that are preventing me
from<00:02:32.540> or<00:02:33.410> I<00:02:33.560> guess<00:02:33.830> anyone<00:02:34.190> I<00:02:34.250> suppose<00:02:34.640> for

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:34.820 
from or I guess anyone I suppose for

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:37.180 
from or I guess anyone I suppose for
making<00:02:35.120> a<00:02:35.209> quarry<00:02:35.450> and<00:02:35.690> seal<00:02:35.900> the<00:02:36.800> first<00:02:37.010> one<00:02:37.160> I

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
making a quarry and seal the first one I

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:39.100 
making a quarry and seal the first one I
just<00:02:37.430> show<00:02:37.670> you<00:02:37.700> guys<00:02:37.880> his<00:02:38.060> Pistons<00:02:38.690> breaking

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110 
just show you guys his Pistons breaking

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:40.360 
just show you guys his Pistons breaking
and<00:02:39.230> that's<00:02:39.350> just<00:02:39.500> the<00:02:39.650> biggest<00:02:39.830> one<00:02:40.100> for<00:02:40.130> me

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
and that's just the biggest one for me

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:43.000 
and that's just the biggest one for me
because<00:02:40.580> making<00:02:41.450> a<00:02:41.720> conveyor<00:02:42.560> belt<00:02:42.680> system

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
because making a conveyor belt system

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:44.650 
because making a conveyor belt system
that<00:02:43.250> you<00:02:43.310> could<00:02:43.459> turn<00:02:43.580> off<00:02:43.819> like<00:02:44.239> doubles

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660 
that you could turn off like doubles

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:47.380 
that you could turn off like doubles
maybe<00:02:44.870> in<00:02:45.110> triples<00:02:45.500> its<00:02:45.709> size<00:02:46.120> unless<00:02:47.120> you

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.390 
maybe in triples its size unless you

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:49.479 
maybe in triples its size unless you
made<00:02:47.570> like<00:02:47.780> redstone<00:02:48.440> wires<00:02:48.770> running<00:02:49.160> across

00:02:49.479 --> 00:02:49.489 
made like redstone wires running across

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:51.130 
made like redstone wires running across
the<00:02:49.790> whole<00:02:49.970> thing<00:02:50.180> that<00:02:50.510> these<00:02:50.690> things<00:02:50.870> flew

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.140 
the whole thing that these things flew

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:52.720 
the whole thing that these things flew
along<00:02:51.410> and<00:02:51.620> you<00:02:51.680> could<00:02:51.830> turn<00:02:52.070> those<00:02:52.280> on<00:02:52.459> but

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
along and you could turn those on but

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:54.820 
along and you could turn those on but
and<00:02:52.970> it<00:02:53.600> seems<00:02:53.810> like<00:02:53.870> having<00:02:54.200> redstone<00:02:54.590> wire

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:54.830 
and it seems like having redstone wire

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:56.320 
and it seems like having redstone wire
would<00:02:55.040> kind<00:02:55.250> of<00:02:55.310> defeat<00:02:55.459> the<00:02:55.610> purpose<00:02:55.760> of<00:02:56.180> the

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:56.330 
would kind of defeat the purpose of the

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:00.280 
would kind of defeat the purpose of the
quarry<00:02:57.640> next<00:02:58.640> parts<00:02:58.850> grapple<00:02:59.300> my<00:02:59.600> kind<00:03:00.200> of

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.290 
quarry next parts grapple my kind of

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:01.990 
quarry next parts grapple my kind of
sideways<00:03:00.500> mining<00:03:00.980> design<00:03:01.280> takes<00:03:01.550> care<00:03:01.820> that

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
sideways mining design takes care that

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.670 
sideways mining design takes care that
actually<00:03:02.360> but<00:03:02.510> I<00:03:02.660> just<00:03:02.840> wanted<00:03:03.170> to<00:03:03.290> mention<00:03:03.440> it

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 
actually but I just wanted to mention it

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.020 
actually but I just wanted to mention it
because<00:03:03.739> gravel<00:03:04.160> is<00:03:04.250> a<00:03:04.280> problem<00:03:04.700> for<00:03:04.730> some

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.030 
because gravel is a problem for some

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:08.229 
because gravel is a problem for some
gory<00:03:05.330> designs<00:03:05.720> and<00:03:06.010> then<00:03:07.010> uh<00:03:07.239> upsetting

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:08.239 
gory designs and then uh upsetting

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:10.530 
gory designs and then uh upsetting
spawners<00:03:08.510> and<00:03:08.780> chests<00:03:09.230> or<00:03:09.350> rather<00:03:09.560> just

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540 
spawners and chests or rather just

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.270 
spawners and chests or rather just
unmovable<00:03:11.540> items<00:03:11.870> that<00:03:12.110> spawn<00:03:12.440> naturally<00:03:12.769> in

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280 
unmovable items that spawn naturally in

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.340 
unmovable items that spawn naturally in
the<00:03:13.400> world<00:03:13.610> those<00:03:14.480> are<00:03:14.690> a<00:03:14.750> big<00:03:14.900> problem<00:03:15.050> of

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:15.350 
the world those are a big problem of

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:17.410 
the world those are a big problem of
course<00:03:15.470> because<00:03:15.739> you<00:03:15.860> know<00:03:15.950> there's<00:03:16.400> no<00:03:16.610> real

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:17.420 
course because you know there's no real

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:18.880 
course because you know there's no real
way<00:03:17.540> forward<00:03:18.200> to<00:03:18.320> get<00:03:18.470> around<00:03:18.650> them<00:03:18.860> so

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:18.890 
way forward to get around them so

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:20.620 
way forward to get around them so
essentially<00:03:19.880> what<00:03:19.970> you'd<00:03:20.120> have<00:03:20.239> to<00:03:20.329> do<00:03:20.510> is

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:20.630 
essentially what you'd have to do is

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:22.360 
essentially what you'd have to do is
maybe<00:03:20.780> like<00:03:20.930> scout<00:03:21.410> out<00:03:21.620> through<00:03:22.040> the<00:03:22.160> caves

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:22.370 
maybe like scout out through the caves

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:24.550 
maybe like scout out through the caves
and<00:03:22.640> stuff<00:03:22.760> of<00:03:23.120> a<00:03:23.329> world<00:03:24.110> and<00:03:24.380> make<00:03:24.530> sure

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
and stuff of a world and make sure

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.229 
and stuff of a world and make sure
there's<00:03:24.980> or<00:03:25.190> use<00:03:25.340> an<00:03:25.489> x-ray<00:03:25.850> glitch<00:03:26.120> or

00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:26.239 
there's or use an x-ray glitch or

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:27.660 
there's or use an x-ray glitch or
something<00:03:26.299> and<00:03:26.660> make<00:03:26.810> sure<00:03:26.840> there's<00:03:27.290> no

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:27.670 
something and make sure there's no

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:30.670 
something and make sure there's no
dungeons<00:03:28.670> or<00:03:28.850> lava<00:03:29.120> anywhere<00:03:29.690> and<00:03:29.959> then<00:03:30.290> if<00:03:30.470> so

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:30.680 
dungeons or lava anywhere and then if so

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:32.430 
dungeons or lava anywhere and then if so
you<00:03:30.739> can<00:03:30.860> set<00:03:31.130> up<00:03:31.250> your<00:03:31.280> quarry<00:03:31.640> in<00:03:31.790> that<00:03:31.940> area

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 
you can set up your quarry in that area

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.780 
you can set up your quarry in that area
liquids<00:03:33.440> I<00:03:33.650> don't<00:03:33.799> think<00:03:33.980> are<00:03:34.100> a<00:03:34.130> problem<00:03:34.370> for

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.790 
liquids I don't think are a problem for

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:37.930 
liquids I don't think are a problem for
the<00:03:35.420> quarry<00:03:35.690> I've<00:03:35.780> been<00:03:36.019> designing<00:03:36.880> aquaria<00:03:37.880> I

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:37.940 
the quarry I've been designing aquaria I

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:39.009 
the quarry I've been designing aquaria I
thought<00:03:38.209> about<00:03:38.299> it's<00:03:38.510> like<00:03:38.630> if<00:03:38.780> you<00:03:38.840> have<00:03:38.959> a

00:03:39.009 --> 00:03:39.019 
thought about it's like if you have a

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:41.080 
thought about it's like if you have a
cube<00:03:39.290> it'll<00:03:39.739> take<00:03:39.890> off<00:03:40.010> like<00:03:40.190> the<00:03:40.400> face<00:03:40.640> of<00:03:40.670> the

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.090 
cube it'll take off like the face of the

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:42.819 
cube it'll take off like the face of the
cube<00:03:41.239> closest<00:03:41.720> to<00:03:41.840> you<00:03:41.959> mind<00:03:42.290> that<00:03:42.470> and<00:03:42.709> then

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:42.829 
cube closest to you mind that and then

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:44.710 
cube closest to you mind that and then
like<00:03:43.010> keep<00:03:43.250> moving<00:03:43.610> forward<00:03:43.850> into<00:03:44.329> the<00:03:44.360> cube

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:44.720 
like keep moving forward into the cube

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:47.680 
like keep moving forward into the cube
instead<00:03:45.230> of<00:03:45.320> minding<00:03:45.620> it<00:03:45.709> from<00:03:45.890> above<00:03:46.690> and

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:47.690 
instead of minding it from above and

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:48.699 
instead of minding it from above and
then<00:03:47.810> the<00:03:47.900> last<00:03:47.930> thing<00:03:48.200> is<00:03:48.350> just<00:03:48.560> the

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:48.709 
then the last thing is just the

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:51.039 
then the last thing is just the
tediousness<00:03:49.130> of<00:03:49.250> the<00:03:49.519> quarry<00:03:49.760> like<00:03:50.570> obviously

00:03:51.039 --> 00:03:51.049 
tediousness of the quarry like obviously

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:52.600 
tediousness of the quarry like obviously
the<00:03:51.200> whole<00:03:51.350> point<00:03:51.530> of<00:03:51.680> the<00:03:51.829> quarry<00:03:52.070> is<00:03:52.250> to<00:03:52.489> get

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:52.610 
the whole point of the quarry is to get

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:55.330 
the whole point of the quarry is to get
it<00:03:52.730> to<00:03:52.820> a<00:03:52.850> point<00:03:53.200> not<00:03:54.200> now<00:03:54.470> but<00:03:55.160> eventually

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:55.340 
it to a point not now but eventually

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:58.150 
it to a point not now but eventually
where<00:03:56.150> it's<00:03:56.780> easier<00:03:57.380> to<00:03:57.530> just<00:03:57.709> set<00:03:57.890> up<00:03:58.010> the

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:58.160 
where it's easier to just set up the

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.310 
where it's easier to just set up the
quarry<00:03:58.489> than<00:03:59.180> to<00:03:59.390> actually<00:03:59.510> do<00:03:59.840> the<00:03:59.989> mining

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:00.320 
quarry than to actually do the mining

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:03.640 
quarry than to actually do the mining
yourself<00:04:01.299> and<00:04:02.299> right<00:04:02.510> now<00:04:02.690> I<00:04:02.930> just<00:04:03.200> don't

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:03.650 
yourself and right now I just don't

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:06.610 
yourself and right now I just don't
think<00:04:03.890> it's<00:04:04.010> good<00:04:04.220> anywhere<00:04:04.700> near<00:04:04.940> that<00:04:05.620> just

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:06.620 
think it's good anywhere near that just

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:09.220 
think it's good anywhere near that just
with<00:04:06.769> all<00:04:06.950> this<00:04:07.540> piston<00:04:08.540> breaking<00:04:08.870> and<00:04:09.019> stuff

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:09.230 
with all this piston breaking and stuff

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:10.930 
with all this piston breaking and stuff
that<00:04:09.590> at<00:04:09.890> least<00:04:10.040> would<00:04:10.220> have<00:04:10.370> to<00:04:10.489> get<00:04:10.609> fixed

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:10.940 
that at least would have to get fixed

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:13.120 
that at least would have to get fixed
before<00:04:11.299> I<00:04:11.329> give<00:04:11.720> this<00:04:11.870> thing<00:04:12.109> another<00:04:12.680> serious

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:13.130 
before I give this thing another serious

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:17.259 
before I give this thing another serious
attempt<00:04:15.100> so<00:04:16.100> yeah<00:04:16.280> I<00:04:16.519> guess<00:04:16.579> this<00:04:16.850> is<00:04:17.000> just<00:04:17.030> my

00:04:17.259 --> 00:04:17.269 
attempt so yeah I guess this is just my

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:19.659 
attempt so yeah I guess this is just my
way<00:04:17.299> of<00:04:17.450> saying<00:04:17.720> the<00:04:18.680> whole<00:04:18.769> quarry<00:04:19.190> stuff<00:04:19.519> is

00:04:19.659 --> 00:04:19.669 
way of saying the whole quarry stuff is

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:22.800 
way of saying the whole quarry stuff is
going<00:04:19.820> to<00:04:19.880> be<00:04:19.970> on<00:04:20.060> hold<00:04:20.329> until<00:04:20.600> you<00:04:21.260> know<00:04:21.789> some

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:22.810 
going to be on hold until you know some

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:25.690 
going to be on hold until you know some
major<00:04:23.810> solution<00:04:24.440> is<00:04:24.590> made<00:04:24.800> and<00:04:25.130> most

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:25.700 
major solution is made and most

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:29.830 
major solution is made and most
to<00:04:25.790> these<00:04:26.000> four<00:04:26.540> areas<00:04:26.720> here<00:04:27.200> I<00:04:28.180> know<00:04:29.180> if<00:04:29.510> they

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:29.840 
to these four areas here I know if they

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:32.590 
to these four areas here I know if they
up<00:04:30.080> like<00:04:30.380> the<00:04:30.590> block<00:04:30.890> limit<00:04:31.310> to<00:04:31.430> like<00:04:31.580> 15<00:04:32.210> said

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:32.600 
up like the block limit to like 15 said

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:35.440 
up like the block limit to like 15 said
12<00:04:32.900> for<00:04:33.080> Pistons<00:04:33.470> that<00:04:33.980> would<00:04:34.130> be<00:04:34.250> amazing<00:04:34.610> I

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:35.450 
12 for Pistons that would be amazing I

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:37.060 
12 for Pistons that would be amazing I
could<00:04:35.900> do<00:04:35.990> so<00:04:36.230> much<00:04:36.380> more<00:04:36.440> with<00:04:36.650> this<00:04:36.830> stuff

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:37.070 
could do so much more with this stuff

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:38.380 
could do so much more with this stuff
but<00:04:37.250> and<00:04:37.460> that<00:04:37.610> would<00:04:37.730> probably<00:04:38.030> make<00:04:38.210> this

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:38.390 
but and that would probably make this

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:40.450 
but and that would probably make this
stuff<00:04:38.540> a<00:04:38.660> lot<00:04:38.750> more<00:04:38.930> come<00:04:39.140> back<00:04:39.350> to<00:04:39.590> and<00:04:39.890> easy

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:40.460 
stuff a lot more come back to and easy

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:44.290 
stuff a lot more come back to and easy
to<00:04:40.640> build<00:04:40.790> but<00:04:41.140> what's<00:04:42.140> going<00:04:42.350> to<00:04:42.440> do<00:04:43.060> this<00:04:44.060> was

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:44.300 
to build but what's going to do this was

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:46.210 
to build but what's going to do this was
a<00:04:44.330> clock<00:04:45.020> that<00:04:45.050> was<00:04:45.380> working<00:04:45.710> on<00:04:45.800> trying<00:04:46.100> to

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:46.220 
a clock that was working on trying to

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:49.270 
a clock that was working on trying to
turn<00:04:46.400> off<00:04:47.140> or<00:04:48.140> was<00:04:48.320> this<00:04:48.470> I<00:04:48.710> don't<00:04:49.130> know<00:04:49.190> what

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:49.280 
turn off or was this I don't know what

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:52.690 
turn off or was this I don't know what
this<00:04:49.400> is<00:04:50.440> so<00:04:51.440> yeah<00:04:51.590> that's<00:04:51.800> all<00:04:51.980> I'll<00:04:52.490> leave

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:52.700 
this is so yeah that's all I'll leave

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:56.640 
this is so yeah that's all I'll leave
you<00:04:52.820> guys<00:04:52.880> with<00:04:53.030> this<00:04:53.240> flying<00:04:53.840> machine<00:04:54.020> here

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:56.650 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:59.110 

kind<00:04:57.650> of<00:04:57.740> didn't<00:04:57.950> work<00:04:58.130> but<00:04:58.310> the<00:04:58.760> point<00:04:58.970> of<00:04:59.030> it

00:04:59.110 --> 00:04:59.120 
kind of didn't work but the point of it

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:01.300 
kind of didn't work but the point of it
is<00:04:59.210> to<00:04:59.270> have<00:04:59.480> like<00:04:59.690> things<00:05:00.500> move<00:05:00.830> in<00:05:01.010> pairs

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:01.310 
is to have like things move in pairs

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:02.560 
is to have like things move in pairs
even<00:05:01.670> though<00:05:01.760> they're<00:05:01.910> not<00:05:01.940> connected<00:05:02.300> by

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:02.570 
even though they're not connected by

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:04.150 
even though they're not connected by
slime<00:05:02.840> blocks<00:05:03.110> like<00:05:03.470> see<00:05:03.620> how<00:05:03.680> the<00:05:03.710> ad<00:05:03.920> or<00:05:04.040> two

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:04.160 
slime blocks like see how the ad or two

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:07.240 
slime blocks like see how the ad or two
are<00:05:04.280> moving<00:05:04.580> at<00:05:04.670> the<00:05:04.790> same<00:05:04.940> time<00:05:06.250> alright

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:07.250 
are moving at the same time alright

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:08.890 
are moving at the same time alright
that's<00:05:07.430> all<00:05:07.640> thanks<00:05:08.210> for<00:05:08.240> watching<00:05:08.360> I'll<00:05:08.840> see

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:08.900 
that's all thanks for watching I'll see

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:10.120 
that's all thanks for watching I'll see
how<00:05:09.110> you<00:05:09.170> guys<00:05:09.350> later<00:05:09.590> with<00:05:09.740> another<00:05:09.770> video
