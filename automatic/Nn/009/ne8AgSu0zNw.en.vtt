blue<00:03:15.060> plastic<00:03:15.420> elephant<00:03:16.019> which<00:03:16.140> you<00:03:16.230> put

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
blue plastic elephant which you put

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:18.319 
blue plastic elephant which you put
butterflies<00:03:16.739> inside<00:03:17.280> of<00:03:17.430> it<00:03:17.519> and<00:03:17.609> then<00:03:18.239> you

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:18.329 
butterflies inside of it and then you

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:19.759 
butterflies inside of it and then you
attached<00:03:18.630> a<00:03:18.810> trunk<00:03:19.170> which<00:03:19.440> would<00:03:19.650> basically

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:19.769 
attached a trunk which would basically

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:22.340 
attached a trunk which would basically
be<00:03:20.070> the<00:03:20.190> air<00:03:20.400> flow<00:03:20.820> unit<00:03:21.239> I<00:03:21.329> guess<00:03:21.570> and<00:03:21.810> you

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 
be the air flow unit I guess and you

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:23.870 
be the air flow unit I guess and you
would<00:03:22.500> turn<00:03:22.650> on<00:03:22.680> the<00:03:22.950> elephant<00:03:23.310> on<00:03:23.459> the<00:03:23.579> bottom

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
would turn on the elephant on the bottom

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:25.640 
would turn on the elephant on the bottom
and<00:03:24.000> air<00:03:24.600> would<00:03:24.900> start<00:03:25.079> circulating<00:03:25.350> through

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
and air would start circulating through

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:27.020 
and air would start circulating through
would<00:03:25.739> it<00:03:25.829> be<00:03:25.890> like<00:03:25.980> a<00:03:26.040> fan<00:03:26.310> and<00:03:26.640> it<00:03:26.790> would<00:03:26.880> push

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
would it be like a fan and it would push

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:28.520 
would it be like a fan and it would push
the<00:03:27.060> butterflies<00:03:27.540> up<00:03:27.750> from<00:03:28.019> the<00:03:28.109> elephant's

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
the butterflies up from the elephant's

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:30.920 
the butterflies up from the elephant's
stomach<00:03:28.890> out<00:03:29.310> of<00:03:29.640> the<00:03:29.819> trunk<00:03:30.239> and<00:03:30.390> you<00:03:30.780> would

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
stomach out of the trunk and you would

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:32.240 
stomach out of the trunk and you would
catch<00:03:31.049> him<00:03:31.200> in<00:03:31.290> a<00:03:31.350> net<00:03:31.380> and<00:03:31.680> whoever<00:03:31.950> had<00:03:32.130> the

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
catch him in a net and whoever had the

00:03:58.729 --> 00:03:58.739 
i didn't really grasp the concept that

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:00.050 
i didn't really grasp the concept that
you<00:03:58.799> could<00:03:59.010> actually<00:03:59.040> move<00:03:59.489> around<00:03:59.639> and

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
you could actually move around and

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:01.490 
you could actually move around and
actually<00:04:00.209> move<00:04:00.569> your<00:04:00.720> net<00:04:00.930> from<00:04:01.079> side<00:04:01.319> to<00:04:01.470> side

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
actually move your net from side to side

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.379 
actually move your net from side to side
to<00:04:01.829> try<00:04:02.010> to<00:04:02.069> catch<00:04:02.250> these<00:04:02.430> butterflies<00:04:02.700> but

my net and I guess I was young enough or

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:58.939 
my net and I guess I was young enough or
old<00:04:56.759> enough<00:04:57.060> I<00:04:57.180> should<00:04:57.360> say<00:04:57.539> to<00:04:57.960> realize<00:04:58.409> that

00:04:58.939 --> 00:04:58.949 
old enough I should say to realize that

old enough I should say to realize that
that<00:04:59.310> was<00:04:59.460> just<00:04:59.639> disrespectful<00:05:00.240> that<00:05:00.419> even<00:05:00.690> if

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:00.780 
that was just disrespectful that even if

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:02.629 
that was just disrespectful that even if
I<00:05:00.840> got<00:05:01.020> zero<00:05:01.199> on<00:05:01.469> my<00:05:01.590> own<00:05:01.740> you're<00:05:02.219> putting<00:05:02.400> one

00:05:02.629 --> 00:05:02.639 
I got zero on my own you're putting one
