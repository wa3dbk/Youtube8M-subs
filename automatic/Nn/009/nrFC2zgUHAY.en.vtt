such a large protrusion is you end up

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.370 
such a large protrusion is you end up
using<00:00:25.109> more<00:00:25.980> wood<00:00:26.400> creating<00:00:27.240> bigger<00:00:27.480> caps<00:00:27.930> and

using more wood creating bigger caps and
you<00:00:28.859> raise<00:00:29.099> the<00:00:29.429> baseline<00:00:29.939> height<00:00:30.179> making<00:00:30.689> it

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
you raise the baseline height making it

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.080 
you raise the baseline height making it
more<00:00:31.140> difficult<00:00:31.380> to<00:00:31.859> work<00:00:32.040> and<00:00:32.399> in<00:00:32.820> some

more difficult to work and in some

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.780 
more difficult to work and in some
circumstances<00:00:33.800> you<00:00:34.800> cannot<00:00:35.250> raise<00:00:35.579> the

your dock an elegant solution devised by

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.549 
your dock an elegant solution devised by
our<00:00:41.430> dock<00:00:41.730> master<00:00:42.239> was<00:00:42.600> to<00:00:42.780> eliminate<00:00:43.050> some<00:00:43.530> of

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
our dock master was to eliminate some of

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.369 
our dock master was to eliminate some of
the<00:00:43.680> blocks<00:00:43.980> then<00:00:44.820> turn<00:00:45.300> the<00:00:45.600> forward<00:00:46.050> blocks

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
the blocks then turn the forward blocks

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.220 
the blocks then turn the forward blocks
over<00:00:46.710> on<00:00:46.860> their<00:00:47.280> side<00:00:47.550> now<00:00:48.510> we<00:00:48.570> can<00:00:49.020> use

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
over on their side now we can use

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.920 
over on their side now we can use
smaller<00:00:49.620> caps<00:00:50.010> and<00:00:50.399> we<00:00:50.879> lowered<00:00:51.270> the<00:00:51.300> baseline

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
smaller caps and we lowered the baseline

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.979 
smaller caps and we lowered the baseline
height<00:00:52.670> however<00:00:53.670> we<00:00:53.940> still<00:00:54.270> could<00:00:54.539> not<00:00:54.570> get

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
height however we still could not get

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.709 
height however we still could not get
over<00:00:55.020> the<00:00:55.230> blocks<00:00:55.620> we<00:00:56.579> had<00:00:56.760> a<00:00:56.789> limited<00:00:57.360> draft

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
over the blocks we had a limited draft

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.229 
over the blocks we had a limited draft
in<00:00:58.020> loading<00:00:58.590> Stern<00:00:58.890> first<00:00:59.219> the<00:00:59.579> sonar<00:01:00.030> dome

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
in loading Stern first the sonar dome

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.709 
in loading Stern first the sonar dome
would<00:01:00.539> contact<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.320> first<00:01:01.559> block<00:01:02.300> so<00:01:03.300> we<00:01:03.480> made

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
would contact the first block so we made

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.080 
would contact the first block so we made
the<00:01:03.930> first<00:01:04.140> block<00:01:04.559> a<00:01:04.799> hinge<00:01:05.189> block<00:01:05.489> so<00:01:05.820> now<00:01:06.030> we

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
the first block a hinge block so now we

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:11.300 
the first block a hinge block so now we
can<00:01:06.420> enter<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:06.900> dock<00:01:07.140> with<00:01:07.439> no<00:01:07.590> problems

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.560 

let's<00:01:12.310> look<00:01:12.460> at<00:01:12.610> some<00:01:12.790> pictures<00:01:12.970> from<00:01:13.390> the

let's look at some pictures from the

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:16.910 
let's look at some pictures from the
docking<00:01:14.070> here<00:01:15.070> you<00:01:15.280> can<00:01:15.460> see<00:01:15.760> our<00:01:15.790> cue<00:01:16.450> line

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
docking here you can see our cue line

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.810 
docking here you can see our cue line
notice<00:01:17.920> the<00:01:18.040> difference<00:01:18.400> between<00:01:18.580> the

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:18.820 
notice the difference between the

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:20.850 
notice the difference between the
upright<00:01:19.270> blocks<00:01:19.630> and<00:01:19.990> the<00:01:20.230> ones<00:01:20.440> that<00:01:20.740> have

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:20.860 
upright blocks and the ones that have

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:24.560 
upright blocks and the ones that have
been<00:01:20.890> laid<00:01:21.250> over<00:01:21.640> on<00:01:21.820> their<00:01:22.000> side

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.480 

now<00:01:25.260> let's<00:01:25.440> take<00:01:25.620> a<00:01:25.680> look<00:01:25.950> at<00:01:26.100> that<00:01:26.220> hinge

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
now let's take a look at that hinge

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.210 
now let's take a look at that hinge
block<00:01:26.850> here<00:01:27.810> we<00:01:27.960> could<00:01:28.110> see<00:01:28.350> the<00:01:28.530> block<00:01:28.830> is<00:01:29.040> in

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
block here we could see the block is in

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.070 
block here we could see the block is in
the<00:01:29.310> lowered<00:01:29.640> position<00:01:29.820> ready<00:01:30.420> for<00:01:30.690> docking
