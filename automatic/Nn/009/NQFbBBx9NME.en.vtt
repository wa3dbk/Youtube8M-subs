00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:05.250
 Hello friends with you today 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:07.049
 I would like to show you how to remove the text 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.630
 or some inscription not be 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:12.150
 photo or picture in general 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.790
 no matter for this we need 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:17.990
 adobe photoshop program itself with 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:21.480
 using it we will delete various 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:24.000
 Text from pictures of photos in general 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:27.300
 no matter let's say you found some 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.170
 picture and there is an inscription that you want 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.539
 to remove 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:34.110
 and instead add yours like this 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:36.800
 I'll show you so for a start 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.960
 run the program photoshop adob and 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.969
 drag that picture either 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:48.600
 photo where we want to remove 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:51.719
 any text let's say ok we 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:54.960
 we can drag in two ways either 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:58.350
 just roll up the program drag 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:00.030
 either click on the file open and select that 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:04.379
 picture we need 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:06.439
 and so on everything is very simple for 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:11.850
 it is enough to choose 

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:15.990
 the straight lasso itself and circle 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:18.750
 the text that we want to remove if u 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.220
 us text located that we 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.310
 we want to remove 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:26.130
 next to some other text like 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.759
 I suppose I suppose I remove the global 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.860
 offencive 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:33.509
 Here and at the top I have a text if we 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:35.610
 we will enter next to this text 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.210
 top let's say I take global 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.930
 offencive 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:43.290
 and we will circle next to the upper text 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.490
 then we will have shoals so if next 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:48.689
 some text 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.350
 actually either some character 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:53.450
 or 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:57.090
 some kind of drawing there and desirable 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:59.450
 circle as close as possible to that text 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:05.580
 which we want to remove 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:08.100
 actually starting to type and how you 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:09.590
 I see very near practically 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:13.800
 close 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:16.980
 I make the outline of the text that I 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:24.569
 I want to remove and then I capture the area 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:27.120
 actually which we will replace this 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:31.410
 text that is, instead of this text will be 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:33.590
 the usual kind of background which is on 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:37.890
 the whole picture in general, will replace 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:41.480
 main background and so now we go into 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:43.440
 edit perform fill and 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:49.110
 choose parameters 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:55.709
 use subject to content click 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:59.790
 ok and wait as you see this text at 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:03:02.280
 us was successfully removed and instead 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:05.100
 just filled the space 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:07.590
 major background after we removed 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:10.260
 text we don't need we can replace it 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:12.120
 and on any other that we need for 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:16.739
 it is enough to click on the icon 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:18.859
 text and enter the name that we 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:18.859
 on 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:27.820
 further click on the arrow 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:30.640
 and now we can place our text in 

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:34.630
 any part of our picture 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:38.860
 we can also lengthen this 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:43.210
 text so and reduce it to do wider and 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:45.450
 already as we need further 

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:48.460
 next if we click 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:50.830
 click again on the text icon we 

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:55.870
 we can circle it 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:59.260
 and further we can choose the color which 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:01.500
 much for this text which we 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.500
 have written 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:08.710
 and also choose any format 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:30.660
 all after that we all save and 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:33.430
 Now weâ€™re actually the final result. 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:37.300
 save any format which 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:38.280
 but we need to go save the file 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:41.190
 as 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:43.900
 choose a place where we want to save 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:45.250
 the result we choose the format I 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:48.730
 I choose jamc as he 

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:50.740
 common and actually save 

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:54.550
 I choose the quality I put 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:59.620
 click ok and everything 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:05:06.010
 now we can see what we have 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:09.070
 It turned out as we see everything successfully with us 

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:11.710
 it turned out now we are actually leaving 

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:12.580
 and that's it would be useful if 

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:14.590
 information 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:18.540
