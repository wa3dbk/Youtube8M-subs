building and personal finance and really

building and personal finance and really
the<00:00:34.290> best<00:00:34.410> thing<00:00:34.559> that<00:00:34.620> you<00:00:34.770> can<00:00:34.950> do<00:00:35.070> is<00:00:35.370> just

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
the best thing that you can do is just

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.970 
the best thing that you can do is just
to<00:00:35.700> keep<00:00:35.820> it<00:00:36.000> simple<00:00:36.649> usually<00:00:37.649> even<00:00:37.770> the

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
to keep it simple usually even the

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.160 
to keep it simple usually even the
people<00:00:38.250> that<00:00:38.460> are<00:00:38.879> creating<00:00:39.390> massive<00:00:39.660> amounts

people that are creating massive amounts

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.130 
people that are creating massive amounts
of<00:00:40.230> passive<00:00:40.649> income<00:00:40.760> without<00:00:41.760> much<00:00:41.940> effort<00:00:42.300> at

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
of passive income without much effort at

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.110 
of passive income without much effort at
one<00:00:43.410> point<00:00:43.620> or<00:00:43.800> another<00:00:43.829> they<00:00:44.640> probably<00:00:44.910> put

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
one point or another they probably put

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.670 
one point or another they probably put
in<00:00:45.270> a<00:00:45.360> lot<00:00:45.570> of<00:00:45.600> effort<00:00:46.050> and<00:00:46.170> a<00:00:46.230> lot<00:00:46.410> of<00:00:46.500> time

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
in a lot of effort and a lot of time

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.770 
in a lot of effort and a lot of time
into<00:00:47.280> building<00:00:47.670> those<00:00:47.879> assets<00:00:48.480> that<00:00:48.629> produce

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
into building those assets that produce

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.500 
into building those assets that produce
money<00:00:49.260> for<00:00:49.469> them<00:00:50.030> but<00:00:51.030> there's<00:00:51.180> something<00:00:51.420> I

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
money for them but there's something I

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:52.760 
money for them but there's something I
just<00:00:51.600> want<00:00:51.719> to<00:00:51.899> talk<00:00:52.020> about<00:00:52.140> that<00:00:52.410> I<00:00:52.440> think<00:00:52.530> is

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
just want to talk about that I think is

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.040 
just want to talk about that I think is
often<00:00:52.980> overlooked<00:00:53.579> and<00:00:53.789> that<00:00:53.850> is<00:00:54.719> probably

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
often overlooked and that is probably

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.680 
often overlooked and that is probably
the<00:00:55.140> fundamental<00:00:55.860> rule<00:00:56.129> about<00:00:56.730> money<00:00:56.969> that

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
the fundamental rule about money that

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.080 
the fundamental rule about money that
you<00:00:57.870> need<00:00:58.020> to<00:00:58.230> not<00:00:59.070> only<00:00:59.100> understand<00:00:59.760> but

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
you need to not only understand but

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.830 
you need to not only understand but
practice<00:01:00.600> before<00:01:01.020> you<00:01:01.170> can<00:01:01.320> do<00:01:01.469> anything<00:01:01.890> else

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:02.840 
practice before you can do anything else

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.620 
practice before you can do anything else
and<00:01:03.840> this<00:01:04.019> is<00:01:04.140> an<00:01:04.260> amazingly<00:01:04.739> simple<00:01:04.830> concept

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:05.630 
and this is an amazingly simple concept

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:07.969 
and this is an amazingly simple concept
but<00:01:06.630> it's<00:01:06.780> a<00:01:06.840> concept<00:01:06.869> that<00:01:07.350> a<00:01:07.439> lot<00:01:07.650> of<00:01:07.740> people

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
but it's a concept that a lot of people

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.620 
but it's a concept that a lot of people
either<00:01:08.100> miss<00:01:08.460> or<00:01:09.000> they<00:01:09.210> don't<00:01:09.390> have<00:01:09.540> the

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
either miss or they don't have the

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.950 
either miss or they don't have the
discipline<00:01:10.080> to<00:01:10.140> follow<00:01:10.700> and<00:01:11.700> that<00:01:12.659> is<00:01:12.810> that

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
discipline to follow and that is that

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.570 
discipline to follow and that is that
you<00:01:13.080> need<00:01:13.290> to<00:01:13.320> either<00:01:13.500> make<00:01:14.130> more<00:01:14.340> than<00:01:14.490> you

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
you need to either make more than you

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.010 
you need to either make more than you
spend<00:01:14.850> or<00:01:15.680> spend<00:01:16.680> less<00:01:17.009> than<00:01:17.070> you<00:01:17.340> make<00:01:18.020> simple

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
spend or spend less than you make simple

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.510 
spend or spend less than you make simple
right<00:01:19.259> you've<00:01:19.560> heard<00:01:19.770> this<00:01:19.890> over<00:01:20.070> and<00:01:20.250> over

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
right you've heard this over and over

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.480 
right you've heard this over and over
again<00:01:20.810> but<00:01:21.810> it's<00:01:21.960> a<00:01:22.020> real<00:01:22.259> problem<00:01:22.470> a<00:01:22.950> lot<00:01:23.369> of

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
again but it's a real problem a lot of

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.130 
again but it's a real problem a lot of
people<00:01:23.729> in<00:01:23.820> America<00:01:24.240> especially<00:01:24.869> are

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
people in America especially are

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.260 
people in America especially are
hemorrhaging<00:01:25.560> with<00:01:25.950> that<00:01:26.159> because<00:01:26.880> we<00:01:27.150> have

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
hemorrhaging with that because we have

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.020 
hemorrhaging with that because we have
this<00:01:27.360> urge<00:01:27.689> to<00:01:28.020> want<00:01:28.680> more<00:01:29.009> want<00:01:29.729> bigger

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
this urge to want more want bigger

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.310 
this urge to want more want bigger
things<00:01:30.390> and<00:01:30.920> have<00:01:31.920> things<00:01:32.100> in<00:01:32.310> excess<00:01:33.320> we're

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
things and have things in excess we're

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.800 
things and have things in excess we're
trained<00:01:34.590> to<00:01:34.650> be<00:01:34.799> over<00:01:35.100> consumers<00:01:35.640> and<00:01:35.880> we<00:01:36.659> do<00:01:36.780> a

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
trained to be over consumers and we do a

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.469 
trained to be over consumers and we do a
really<00:01:37.020> good<00:01:37.229> job<00:01:37.380> of<00:01:37.560> it<00:01:37.850> but<00:01:38.850> before<00:01:39.000> you<00:01:39.299> can

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
really good job of it but before you can

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.569 
really good job of it but before you can
build<00:01:39.720> wealth<00:01:40.020> you<00:01:40.650> have<00:01:40.680> to<00:01:40.979> learn<00:01:41.159> to<00:01:41.220> keep

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
build wealth you have to learn to keep

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.580 
build wealth you have to learn to keep
more<00:01:41.880> of<00:01:41.909> the<00:01:42.060> money<00:01:42.090> that<00:01:42.450> you<00:01:42.540> make<00:01:42.720> that<00:01:43.409> way

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
more of the money that you make that way

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.039 
more of the money that you make that way
you<00:01:43.649> can<00:01:43.979> use<00:01:44.549> that<00:01:44.729> money<00:01:44.939> and<00:01:45.149> leverage<00:01:45.869> it

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
you can use that money and leverage it

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:49.039 
you can use that money and leverage it
to<00:01:46.200> produce<00:01:46.380> more<00:01:46.979> income<00:01:47.750> think<00:01:48.750> of<00:01:48.810> it<00:01:48.930> this

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
to produce more income think of it this

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.649 
to produce more income think of it this
way<00:01:49.220> let's<00:01:50.220> say<00:01:50.369> every<00:01:50.909> paycheck<00:01:51.180> that<00:01:51.540> you

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
way let's say every paycheck that you

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.399 
way let's say every paycheck that you
get<00:01:51.899> you<00:01:52.860> take<00:01:53.040> $100<00:01:53.790> and<00:01:54.030> invested<00:01:54.720> in<00:01:54.899> a

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
get you take $100 and invested in a

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.950 
get you take $100 and invested in a
mutual<00:01:55.829> fund<00:01:55.860> that<00:01:56.729> averages<00:01:57.299> let's<00:01:57.719> say<00:01:57.840> an

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
mutual fund that averages let's say an

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.190 
mutual fund that averages let's say an
