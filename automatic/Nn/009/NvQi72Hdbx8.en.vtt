00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:43.579
 to think news contour beige ni por por 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:46.220
 spirit neither by word nor by cake 

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:49.640
 as if it were ours in the sense of 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:52.340
 that the day of the Lord is near nobody 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:55.189
 cheat in any way because it will not come 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:57.109
 without first coming apostasy and 

00:02:55.189 --> 00:02:59.689
 manifest the man of sin 

00:02:57.109 --> 00:03:01.849
 the son of perdition which he opposes 

00:02:59.689 --> 00:03:05.540
 rise against all that is called god 

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:08.139
 or its cult object so much that 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:10.870
 sit in the temple of god as god 

00:03:08.139 --> 00:03:13.659
 pretending to be god 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:17.230
 you do not remember when I was 

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:19.480
 still with you I told you this and 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:21.819
 now you know what stops him 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:23.350
 so that in due time it 

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:25.870
 manifest 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:28.510
 because the mystery of 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:31.630
 the entity only he who now 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:34.510
 present stops him until he to his 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:37.240
 once it has been removed from the middle and then 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:39.400
 it will be manifested to whoever prevented whom 

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:42.250
 the lord will kill with the spirit of his 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:45.310
 mouth and it will destroy with the radiance of its 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:49.180
 come the advent of this prevents 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:51.700
 that is the work of satan will be accompanied by 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:54.940
 Facts made powerful and false signals 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:57.760
 miracles and all guile entity 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:59.830
 for those who get lost because they do not 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:01.330
 they received the love of truth to be 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:03.460
 saved 

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:07.030
 this is why god descended a power 

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:09.400
 deceiving so that they believe in lying to 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:11.560
 so that all those who are sentenced 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:14.320
 they did not believe the truth but they 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:16.690
 they indulged in injustice but 

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:19.060
 we should always give thanks to 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:22.090

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:30.340
 salvation through sanctification by 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:32.620

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:47.530
 doctrine that you have learned be by 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:50.290
 word or by our letter and the same 

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:53.110
 Jesus Christ Lord our God our 

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:56.020
 father who loved us and gave us 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:59.530

 second Thessalonians 3 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:11.159
 otherwise brothers now more for 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:15.430
 us so that the word of the Lord 

00:05:11.159 --> 00:05:17.650
 cap and be glorified as it was 

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:20.310
 between you and for us to be 

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:23.919
 rid of wicked and evil men 

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:26.830
 because it is not of all the faith but faithful is 

00:05:23.919 --> 00:05:29.680
 the lord who will affirm you and keep you from 

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:32.710
 bad and we have confidence in 

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:36.400
 you in the Lord in what you do and 

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:39.880
 you will do what we have commanded you and the 

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:43.500
 Lord, guide your hearts to 

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:46.500
 love of God and patience the Christ 

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:48.990
 but we order you brothers in the name 

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:51.000
 of our Lord Jesus Christ that you 

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:53.730
 away from every brother who walks 

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:56.970
 disorderly and not according to the teaching 

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:58.980
 that you received from us because 

00:05:56.970 --> 00:06:01.680
 you yourselves know in what way 

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:03.450
 You must invite us, we do not 

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:06.270
 we messed around between 

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:09.990
 you did not eat the bread of 

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:13.170
 nobody on the contrary we work with eagerness and 

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:15.810
 fatigue day and night so as not to be burdensome 

00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:18.150
 to none of you not because no 

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:20.340
 we had right but to give us 

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:23.490
 ourselves an example that you can 

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:26.970
 imitate because also when we are with 

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:28.490
 you order us come on this what if 

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:32.070
 someone does not want to work 

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:35.070
 do not eat either because we hear that some of 

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:37.830
 among you they walk disorderly not 

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:41.160
 working on nothing but meddling 

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:43.070
 in the foreign to those we send and 

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:46.800
 we exhort for our Lord Jesus Christ 

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:48.200
 that working quietly eat their 

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:51.110
 own bread 

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:53.900
 but you brothers are not looking for 6 of 

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:56.890
 do well if someone does not obey what 

00:06:53.900 --> 00:07:00.350
 we decided through this letter to that 

00:06:56.890 --> 00:07:02.690
 pointing out do not join with him so that 

00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:05.860
 be ashamed but do not have it 

00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:09.470
 enemy but admonish as a brother 

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:12.890
 and the same lord of peace you always 

00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:15.920
 peace in every way the Lord be with 

00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:19.370
 all of you salutations of my 

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:23.780
 Paul's own hand which is the sign in 

00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:26.450
 every letter of mine writes the grace of 

00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:29.980
 our Lord Jesus Christ be with all 

00:07:26.450 --> 00:07:29.980
 you amen
