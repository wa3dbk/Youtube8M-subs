00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:36.290 
think it'll go 12 rounds I thought the

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:37.630 
think it'll go 12 rounds I thought the
other<00:03:36.440> fight<00:03:36.770> the<00:03:37.070> fight<00:03:37.280> the<00:03:37.430> other<00:03:37.460> night

it'll<00:03:40.160> be<00:03:40.250> a<00:03:40.340> 12-round<00:03:40.970> fight<00:03:41.150> I<00:03:41.330> think

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:41.720 
it'll be a 12-round fight I think

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:43.660
