program<00:00:37.860> I<00:00:38.100> think<00:00:38.190> validators<00:00:38.940> fair<00:00:39.180> it's

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
program I think validators fair it's

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.770 
program I think validators fair it's
fair<00:00:39.600> to<00:00:39.750> say<00:00:39.930> that<00:00:39.960> I<00:00:40.170> think<00:00:41.120> anybody<00:00:42.120> being<00:00:42.690> a

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
fair to say that I think anybody being a

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.500 
fair to say that I think anybody being a
champion<00:00:43.020> is<00:00:43.380> what<00:00:43.649> defines<00:00:44.100> a<00:00:44.489> sport<00:00:45.329> when

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
champion is what defines a sport when

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:46.700 
champion is what defines a sport when
you're<00:00:45.629> talking<00:00:45.960> about<00:00:46.020> winning<00:00:46.469> and<00:00:46.590> losing

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
now being champions is just a product of

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.389 
now being champions is just a product of
all<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:50.820> things<00:00:51.030> we<00:00:51.210> do<00:00:51.420> in<00:00:51.540> our<00:00:51.629> program<00:00:52.399> you

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
wants one when it's his turn

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:27.680 
wants one when it's his turn
that's<00:02:25.410> big<00:02:25.650> and<00:02:25.770> with<00:02:26.730> nobility<00:02:26.940> I<00:02:27.270> mean<00:02:27.480> I'm

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
that's big and with nobility I mean I'm

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.780 
that's big and with nobility I mean I'm
sure<00:02:27.750> he<00:02:27.960> wants<00:02:28.200> to<00:02:28.230> up<00:02:28.830> my<00:02:29.100> records<00:02:29.490> and<00:02:29.610> also

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
sure he wants to up my records and also

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.210 
sure he wants to up my records and also
once<00:02:30.510> somebody<00:02:30.960> said<00:02:31.260> something<00:02:31.560> like<00:02:31.800> with<00:02:32.190> a

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
once somebody said something like with a

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:33.830 
once somebody said something like with a
state<00:02:32.520> champion<00:02:33.030> obviously<00:02:33.540> the<00:02:33.660> other

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
state champion obviously the other

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.990 
state champion obviously the other
brother<00:02:34.110> wants<00:02:34.410> either<00:02:34.530> match<00:02:35.250> it<00:02:35.520> or<00:02:35.730> go

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
brother wants either match it or go

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.660 
brother wants either match it or go
above<00:02:36.270> and<00:02:36.510> beyond<00:02:36.810> so<00:02:37.050> I<00:02:37.200> think<00:02:37.560> that's<00:02:37.800> part

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
above and beyond so I think that's part

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:39.890 
above and beyond so I think that's part
of<00:02:38.730> the<00:02:38.790> reason<00:02:39.210> like<00:02:39.330> they<00:02:39.450> don't<00:02:39.600> want<00:02:39.720> to<00:02:39.810> be

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
of the reason like they don't want to be

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.320 
of the reason like they don't want to be
left<00:02:40.110> out<00:02:40.350> if<00:02:40.740> they<00:02:40.920> don't<00:02:41.730> get<00:02:41.880> that<00:02:42.060> state

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
left out if they don't get that state

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:44.000 
left out if they don't get that state
title<00:02:42.570> so<00:02:42.930> I<00:02:42.959> think<00:02:43.290> that's<00:02:43.590> part<00:02:43.800> of<00:02:43.920> their

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
title so I think that's part of their

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.430 
title so I think that's part of their
goal<00:02:44.280> in<00:02:44.700> fact<00:02:45.090> nearly<00:02:45.480> half<00:02:45.840> the<00:02:46.050> starting

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
goal in fact nearly half the starting

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.070 
goal in fact nearly half the starting
lineup<00:02:46.770> is<00:02:46.920> made<00:02:47.160> up<00:02:47.340> of<00:02:47.520> two<00:02:47.760> families<00:02:48.090> meet

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
lineup is made up of two families meet

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.830 
lineup is made up of two families meet
start<00:02:49.500> out<00:02:49.650> with<00:02:49.890> Ty<00:02:50.190> Lee<00:02:50.459> then<00:02:51.060> Trent<00:02:51.480> Leon

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
start out with Ty Lee then Trent Leon

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.460 
start out with Ty Lee then Trent Leon
then<00:02:52.470> Zack<00:02:52.890> Lee<00:02:53.190> Trey<00:02:53.910> Leon<00:02:54.360> and<00:02:54.660> Robert<00:02:55.290> Lee
