together<00:06:11.650> and<00:06:12.650> I<00:06:12.740> think<00:06:12.950> that's<00:06:13.100> probably<00:06:13.250> his

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:13.550 
together and I think that's probably his

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:15.820 
together and I think that's probably his
way<00:06:13.730> of<00:06:13.850> saying<00:06:14.120> this<00:06:14.900> this<00:06:15.230> is<00:06:15.410> where<00:06:15.620> my

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:15.830 
way of saying this this is where my

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:19.390 
way of saying this this is where my
heart<00:06:16.130> is<00:06:16.340> I<00:06:17.290> hope<00:06:18.290> that<00:06:18.470> you<00:06:18.590> can<00:06:18.800> join<00:06:18.830> me<00:06:19.250> in

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:19.400 
heart is I hope that you can join me in

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:22.390 
heart is I hope that you can join me in
my<00:06:19.910> love<00:06:20.480> and<00:06:20.630> interest<00:06:20.840> of<00:06:21.110> the<00:06:21.170> place<00:06:21.380> do<00:06:22.370> you

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:22.400 
my love and interest of the place do you

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:25.060 
my love and interest of the place do you
think<00:06:22.760> we<00:06:23.000> can<00:06:23.240> actually<00:06:24.200> sort<00:06:24.350> of<00:06:24.440> map<00:06:24.800> in

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:25.070 
think we can actually sort of map in

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:27.430 
think we can actually sort of map in
some<00:06:25.340> way<00:06:25.550> the<00:06:25.790> nature<00:06:26.030> of<00:06:26.240> his<00:06:26.420> affections<00:06:26.990> if

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:27.440 
some way the nature of his affections if

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:29.620 
some way the nature of his affections if
you<00:06:27.650> take<00:06:27.890> an<00:06:28.040> aerial<00:06:28.490> view<00:06:28.520> or<00:06:29.030> flat<00:06:29.330> furred

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:29.630 
you take an aerial view or flat furred

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:32.220 
you take an aerial view or flat furred
and<00:06:29.750> you<00:06:29.930> actually<00:06:30.110> put<00:06:30.530> a<00:06:30.770> grid<00:06:31.340> of<00:06:31.550> all<00:06:31.910> the

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:32.230 
and you actually put a grid of all the

00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:34.420 
and you actually put a grid of all the
viewpoints<00:06:33.230> that<00:06:33.410> he<00:06:33.530> painted<00:06:34.130> all<00:06:34.280> the

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:34.430 
viewpoints that he painted all the

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:36.400 
viewpoints that he painted all the
sketches<00:06:35.000> all<00:06:35.300> the<00:06:35.450> oil<00:06:35.630> sketches<00:06:36.140> all<00:06:36.290> the

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:36.410 
sketches all the oil sketches all the

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:38.440 
sketches all the oil sketches all the
finished<00:06:36.740> paintings<00:06:37.190> it<00:06:37.820> comes<00:06:38.090> out<00:06:38.270> as<00:06:38.420> a

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:38.450 
finished paintings it comes out as a

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:40.960 
finished paintings it comes out as a
spider's<00:06:38.930> web<00:06:39.080> almost<00:06:39.470> so<00:06:40.370> let's<00:06:40.520> start<00:06:40.790> with

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:40.970 
spider's web almost so let's start with

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:43.270 
spider's web almost so let's start with
the<00:06:41.090> hay<00:06:41.210> Wain<00:06:41.440> painted<00:06:42.440> from<00:06:42.620> here<00:06:42.890> and<00:06:43.160> it

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:43.280 
the hay Wain painted from here and it

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:46.480 
the hay Wain painted from here and it
just<00:06:43.640> clips<00:06:43.970> the<00:06:44.330> end<00:06:44.870> of<00:06:45.140> the<00:06:45.410> Millhouse<00:06:45.980> here

I think that that core is here I think

00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:29.969 
I think that that core is here I think
