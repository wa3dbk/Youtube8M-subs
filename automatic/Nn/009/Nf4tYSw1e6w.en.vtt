00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:28.019
 in general, root rights at least do not wander 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.779
 big plus given cheat root rights and 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.700

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:36.360
 I told you that on any device 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:40.460
 can go these root rights i was wrong in 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:42.840
 This husband is not any but I think 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:45.960

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:49.530

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:52.440
 device because outfit is not to blame 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:55.640
 that you do not have that before others for long 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:01:01.289
 It was loading and that's why 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:02.969
 going well, Che those well, let's assume 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:06.710
 that you have some powerful game 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:12.260
 gata vaishity that's how i have this 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:12.260
 place minecraft then this account and 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.580
 and other games like asphalt and all 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.750
 such and you have a weak smartphone 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.549

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:30.860
 and tell you the fact that you have a game 

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:33.960
 buggy it is not a weak processor and 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:37.860
 quantitative Jager and then kept on 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:42.540
 it is not completely that is most important it 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:43.200
 not a processor and RAM and its 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.329
 need to 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.399
 At times, we need to clean up the years 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:49.229
 The application has a dispatcher that can 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:50.700
 Download the server in the marketplace and give 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:57.400

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:23.410
