00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
we have a look on the thread there's

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.590 
we have a look on the thread there's
commands<00:02:28.930> such<00:02:29.170> as<00:02:29.230> VIP<00:02:29.710> paypal<00:02:30.580> donate<00:02:31.330> and

commands such as VIP paypal donate and
whatnot<00:02:32.100> so<00:02:33.540> these<00:02:34.540> will<00:02:34.720> just<00:02:34.780> show<00:02:35.160> when

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 
whatnot so these will just show when

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:37.440 
whatnot so these will just show when
they<00:02:36.280> type<00:02:36.490> in<00:02:36.580> that<00:02:36.730> command<00:02:36.970> it<00:02:37.120> will<00:02:37.180> come

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
they type in that command it will come

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:38.640 
they type in that command it will come
up<00:02:37.570> with<00:02:37.690> that<00:02:37.840> so<00:02:38.050> you<00:02:38.140> can<00:02:38.200> turn<00:02:38.320> it<00:02:38.380> on<00:02:38.500> and

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
up with that so you can turn it on and

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:41.910 
up with that so you can turn it on and
off<00:02:38.740> of<00:02:39.430> true<00:02:39.670> or<00:02:39.760> false<00:02:39.910> there<00:02:40.590> when<00:02:41.590> then<00:02:41.770> do

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
off of true or false there when then do

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.420 
off of true or false there when then do
info<00:02:43.170> to<00:02:44.170> generate<00:02:44.500> go<00:02:44.710> to<00:02:44.770> the<00:02:44.950> server<00:02:45.220> web

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
info to generate go to the server web

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:48.690 
info to generate go to the server web
site<00:02:45.640> so<00:02:46.740> that's<00:02:47.740> the<00:02:47.920> information<00:02:48.310> now<00:02:48.430> again

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
site so that's the information now again

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.000 
site so that's the information now again
so<00:02:48.910> you<00:02:48.970> can<00:02:49.030> change<00:02:49.330> that<00:02:49.480> and<00:02:49.770> then<00:02:50.770> you<00:02:50.920> can

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
so you can change that and then you can

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:53.070 
so you can change that and then you can
type<00:02:51.220> in<00:02:51.370> VIP<00:02:51.640> and<00:02:51.880> repair<00:02:52.240> so<00:02:52.480> this<00:02:52.660> is<00:02:52.840> what

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:53.080 
type in VIP and repair so this is what

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
the VIP will get if they become a

the VIP will get if they become a
donator<00:02:56.490> and<00:02:57.490> then<00:02:57.640> this<00:02:57.790> is<00:02:58.000> what<00:02:58.210> the<00:02:58.360> play

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540

or<00:02:58.720> gave<00:02:58.900> they<00:02:59.230> deny<00:02:59.650> even<00:02:59.770> more<00:03:00.210> so<00:03:01.210> then<00:03:01.360> you

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 
or gave they deny even more so then you

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.000 
or gave they deny even more so then you
can<00:03:01.600> also<00:03:01.720> have<00:03:01.900> a<00:03:01.930> paypal<00:03:02.350> section<00:03:02.740> so<00:03:02.920> if
