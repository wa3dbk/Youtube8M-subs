allocation<00:03:31.220> of<00:03:31.280> focus<00:03:31.610> to<00:03:31.760> I<00:03:31.819> was<00:03:32.000> gonna<00:03:32.120> I

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:32.209 
allocation of focus to I was gonna I

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:34.720 
allocation of focus to I was gonna I
should<00:03:32.720> have<00:03:32.810> kept<00:03:32.989> three<00:03:33.260> on<00:03:33.410> scar<00:03:33.770> and<00:03:34.069> that

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:34.730 
should have kept three on scar and that

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:36.850 
should have kept three on scar and that
way<00:03:34.819> I<00:03:34.849> could<00:03:34.970> have<00:03:35.150> cast<00:03:35.450> backlash<00:03:36.410> on

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:36.860 
way I could have cast backlash on

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:39.040 
way I could have cast backlash on
through<00:03:37.400> the<00:03:37.580> the<00:03:37.940> death<00:03:38.090> of<00:03:38.239> run<00:03:38.450> to<00:03:38.569> the<00:03:38.690> the

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:44.090 
in with the remainder of the the statics

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:45.759 
in with the remainder of the the statics
asst<00:03:44.239> a<00:03:44.450> couple<00:03:44.989> of<00:03:45.110> meant<00:03:45.260> the<00:03:45.349> distance<00:03:45.650> to

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:45.769 
asst a couple of meant the distance to

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:48.309 
asst a couple of meant the distance to
charge<00:03:46.069> the<00:03:46.849> other<00:03:47.000> two<00:03:47.420> here<00:03:47.810> did<00:03:48.019> not<00:03:48.140> they

00:03:48.309 --> 00:03:48.319

just<00:03:48.500> advanced<00:03:48.980> and<00:03:49.130> I<00:03:49.760> think<00:03:50.000> out<00:03:50.150> of<00:03:50.269> the

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:50.360 
just advanced and I think out of the

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:54.309 
just advanced and I think out of the
five<00:03:50.630> I<00:03:50.989> hit<00:03:51.230> with<00:03:51.530> one<00:03:52.400> and<00:03:52.959> order<00:03:53.959> I<00:03:54.019> hit<00:03:54.200> with

00:03:54.309 --> 00:03:54.319 
five I hit with one and order I hit with

five I hit with one and order I hit with
maybe<00:03:54.500> two<00:03:54.769> and<00:03:55.100> failed<00:03:55.819> to<00:03:55.940> damage<00:03:56.330> the<00:03:56.420> shoot

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:56.600 
maybe two and failed to damage the shoot

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:58.059 
maybe two and failed to damage the shoot
it<00:03:56.720> with<00:03:56.840> three<00:03:57.200> and<00:03:57.230> filled<00:03:57.590> the<00:03:57.709> damage<00:03:58.040> to

00:03:58.059 --> 00:03:58.069 
it with three and filled the damage to

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:00.550 
it with three and filled the damage to
all<00:03:58.730> right<00:03:58.910> yeah<00:03:59.480> so<00:03:59.810> I<00:03:59.840> ended<00:04:00.080> up<00:04:00.140> doing<00:04:00.410> one
