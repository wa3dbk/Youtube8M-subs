00:01:03.939 --> 00:01:03.949

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
between the rubber tip and the edge of

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.320 
between the rubber tip and the edge of
the<00:01:07.740> rest<00:01:08.250> of<00:01:08.369> the<00:01:08.460> stylus<00:01:08.880> so<00:01:09.000> that<00:01:09.150> was<00:01:09.240> an

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
the rest of the stylus so that was an

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:10.700 
the rest of the stylus so that was an
issue<00:01:09.450> with<00:01:09.689> me<00:01:09.810> there<00:01:10.020> and<00:01:10.140> this<00:01:10.320> one<00:01:10.560> does

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
issue with me there and this one does

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.350 
issue with me there and this one does
that<00:01:10.830> I<00:01:10.860> haven't<00:01:11.310> had<00:01:11.520> that<00:01:11.580> issue<00:01:11.939> and<00:01:12.240> I've

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
that I haven't had that issue and I've

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.530 
that I haven't had that issue and I've
been<00:01:12.540> using<00:01:12.720> it<00:01:12.930> for<00:01:12.990> about<00:01:13.229> a<00:01:13.350> week<00:01:13.439> now<00:01:13.740> and

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:14.540 
been using it for about a week now and

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:17.630 
been using it for about a week now and
so<00:01:15.540> as<00:01:15.810> it<00:01:16.200> is<00:01:16.229> right<00:01:16.590> here<00:01:16.920> just<00:01:17.310> a<00:01:17.430> regular

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
so as it is right here just a regular

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.600 
so as it is right here just a regular
stay<00:01:18.060> on<00:01:18.119> a<00:01:18.210> stylus<00:01:18.659> it<00:01:19.049> works<00:01:19.290> fine<00:01:19.799> but<00:01:20.520> the

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
stay on a stylus it works fine but the

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.490 
stay on a stylus it works fine but the
main<00:01:20.880> purpose<00:01:21.270> behind<00:01:21.600> this<00:01:21.930> is<00:01:21.990> that<00:01:22.350> you

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
main purpose behind this is that you

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.740 
main purpose behind this is that you
take<00:01:22.710> out<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:23.220> middle<00:01:23.369> part<00:01:23.700> here<00:01:23.939> and<00:01:24.119> flip

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
take out the middle part here and flip

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.870 
take out the middle part here and flip
it<00:01:24.840> around<00:01:24.990> and<00:01:25.350> then<00:01:25.530> you<00:01:25.560> have<00:01:25.830> a<00:01:25.880> full-blown

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
it around and then you have a full-blown

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.719 
it around and then you have a full-blown
paint<00:01:27.840> brush<00:01:28.020> so<00:01:28.740> if<00:01:28.920> you're<00:01:29.070> into<00:01:29.280> painting

and I'm sure you could use it with
regular<00:01:42.659> pictures<00:01:43.259> but<00:01:43.409> but<00:01:43.680> that's<00:01:43.860> beside

think<00:01:50.250> they've<00:01:50.399> been<00:01:50.570> optimized<00:01:51.570> for<00:01:51.780> a

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960

think they've been optimized for a

down here along the track there are

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.469 
down here along the track there are
different<00:02:08.550> tips<00:02:08.789> that<00:02:08.880> you<00:02:09.030> can<00:02:09.149> use<00:02:09.209> but

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
different tips that you can use but

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.150 
different tips that you can use but
we're<00:02:09.660> really<00:02:09.899> just<00:02:09.989> going<00:02:10.229> to<00:02:10.289> focus<00:02:10.380> on<00:02:10.890> the

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
we're really just going to focus on the

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.070 
we're really just going to focus on the
bottom<00:02:11.489> one<00:02:11.640> here<00:02:11.940> what's<00:02:12.150> cousin<00:02:12.510> it's<00:02:12.900> the

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
bottom one here what's cousin it's the

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.250 
bottom one here what's cousin it's the
closest<00:02:13.709> to<00:02:14.010> mimic<00:02:14.880> a<00:02:15.090> regular<00:02:15.810> paintbrush

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
closest to mimic a regular paintbrush

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.410 
closest to mimic a regular paintbrush
and<00:02:16.950> also<00:02:17.370> for<00:02:17.550> this<00:02:17.610> demonstration<00:02:18.060> I'm<00:02:18.270> not

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
and also for this demonstration I'm not

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:19.940 
and also for this demonstration I'm not
gonna<00:02:18.599> multicolored<00:02:19.140> it<00:02:19.349> I'm<00:02:19.470> just<00:02:19.709> really

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
gonna multicolored it I'm just really

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.620 
gonna multicolored it I'm just really
gonna<00:02:20.069> show<00:02:20.280> you<00:02:20.340> maybe<00:02:20.580> blue<00:02:20.910> and<00:02:21.090> red<00:02:21.239> just

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
gonna show you maybe blue and red just

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.720 
gonna show you maybe blue and red just
to<00:02:21.780> show<00:02:21.930> you<00:02:21.989> the<00:02:22.170> difference<00:02:22.530> so<00:02:23.160> what<00:02:23.700> I

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
to show you the difference so what I

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.460 
to show you the difference so what I
really<00:02:24.269> want<00:02:24.510> to<00:02:24.660> test<00:02:24.900> out<00:02:25.080> was<00:02:25.319> the

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
really want to test out was the

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.050 
really want to test out was the
difference<00:02:25.800> between<00:02:25.980> the<00:02:26.370> rubber<00:02:26.550> tip<00:02:26.849> and

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
difference between the rubber tip and

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.170 
difference between the rubber tip and
the<00:02:27.690> paint<00:02:27.900> brush<00:02:28.050> tip<00:02:28.260> so<00:02:28.530> if<00:02:28.769> I<00:02:29.180> apply

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
the paint brush tip so if I apply

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.140 
the paint brush tip so if I apply
pressure<00:02:31.190> throughout<00:02:32.190> the<00:02:32.370> whole<00:02:32.580> stroke

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
pressure throughout the whole stroke

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:42.710 
pressure throughout the whole stroke
with<00:02:33.420> the<00:02:33.510> rubber<00:02:33.690> tip<00:02:33.959> you<00:02:34.410> get<00:02:34.590> this<00:02:41.450> there<00:02:42.450> I

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
with the rubber tip you get this there I

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:48.199 
with the rubber tip you get this there I
do<00:02:43.560> one<00:02:43.739> more<00:02:43.769> time<00:02:45.560> there<00:02:46.560> you<00:02:46.620> go<00:02:46.880> by<00:02:47.880> apply

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
do one more time there you go by apply

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:50.390 
do one more time there you go by apply
full<00:02:48.540> pressure<00:02:48.840> with<00:02:49.769> the<00:02:49.860> paintbrush<00:02:50.130> tip

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
full pressure with the paintbrush tip

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:56.750 
full pressure with the paintbrush tip
you<00:02:50.610> get<00:02:50.700> this<00:02:54.950> do<00:02:55.950> you<00:02:56.010> see<00:02:56.160> a<00:02:56.190> difference

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
you get this do you see a difference

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.960 
you get this do you see a difference
no<00:02:57.060> and<00:02:57.569> I<00:02:57.660> guess<00:02:57.870> that's<00:02:58.170> a<00:02:58.410> good<00:02:58.650> thing<00:02:58.970> the

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
no and I guess that's a good thing the

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.210 
no and I guess that's a good thing the
next<00:03:00.180> thing<00:03:00.299> I<00:03:00.450> really<00:03:00.750> want<00:03:00.930> to<00:03:01.049> test<00:03:01.260> out<00:03:01.530> was

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
next thing I really want to test out was

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:06.320 
next thing I really want to test out was
seeing<00:03:02.610> what<00:03:03.000> would<00:03:03.150> happen<00:03:03.599> if<00:03:04.040> I<00:03:05.330> applied

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
seeing what would happen if I applied

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.720 
seeing what would happen if I applied
pressure<00:03:06.630> and<00:03:07.049> then<00:03:07.200> let<00:03:07.470> go

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
pressure and then let go

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.360 
pressure and then let go
in<00:03:09.209> mid-stroke<00:03:10.019> and<00:03:10.320> then<00:03:10.530> reapply<00:03:10.980> pressure

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
in mid-stroke and then reapply pressure

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:15.380 
in mid-stroke and then reapply pressure
if<00:03:11.700> you<00:03:12.269> would<00:03:12.420> see<00:03:13.310> the<00:03:14.310> brush<00:03:14.670> leaving<00:03:15.299> the

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
if you would see the brush leaving the

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:17.090 
if you would see the brush leaving the
paper<00:03:15.600> and<00:03:15.959> then<00:03:16.230> going<00:03:16.500> back<00:03:16.530> to<00:03:16.709> the<00:03:16.920> paper

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:17.100 
paper and then going back to the paper

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:19.940 
paper and then going back to the paper
so<00:03:17.280> kind<00:03:17.730> of<00:03:17.790> a<00:03:17.970> a<00:03:18.239> thick<00:03:18.959> line<00:03:19.230> thin<00:03:19.680> line

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
so kind of a a thick line thin line

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:21.380 
so kind of a a thick line thin line
thick<00:03:20.310> line<00:03:20.519> that's<00:03:20.760> what<00:03:20.970> I<00:03:21.000> was<00:03:21.150> kind<00:03:21.269> of

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
thick line that's what I was kind of

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:24.229 
thick line that's what I was kind of
hoping<00:03:21.570> for<00:03:22.049> and<00:03:22.260> because<00:03:22.920> ArtRage<00:03:23.400> is<00:03:23.790> meant

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
hoping for and because ArtRage is meant

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:25.849 
hoping for and because ArtRage is meant
to<00:03:24.420> do<00:03:24.600> that<00:03:24.810> I<00:03:24.840> mean<00:03:24.989> that's<00:03:25.170> what<00:03:25.380> this<00:03:25.620> app

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:25.859 
to do that I mean that's what this app

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:28.610 
to do that I mean that's what this app
is<00:03:26.190> meant<00:03:26.400> to<00:03:26.549> really<00:03:26.760> demonstrate<00:03:27.060> is<00:03:27.620> almost

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
is meant to really demonstrate is almost

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:32.270 
is meant to really demonstrate is almost
true<00:03:29.010> to<00:03:29.160> life<00:03:29.329> painting<00:03:30.329> on<00:03:30.540> a<00:03:31.079> tablet<00:03:31.590> hoping

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
true to life painting on a tablet hoping

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.099 
true to life painting on a tablet hoping
our<00:03:32.430> trades<00:03:32.609> would<00:03:32.730> do<00:03:32.850> that<00:03:33.060> and<00:03:33.269> this<00:03:33.959> is

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:34.109 
our trades would do that and this is

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:38.210 
our trades would do that and this is
what<00:03:34.260> I<00:03:34.290> had<00:03:34.470> so<00:03:35.870> all<00:03:36.870> pressure<00:03:37.230> let<00:03:37.680> go<00:03:37.859> our

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:05.910 
want to feel like they're painting with

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:08.240 
want to feel like they're painting with
a<00:04:05.940> real<00:04:06.420> paintbrush<00:04:07.260> if<00:04:07.620> that's<00:04:07.950> what<00:04:08.130> you

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
a real paintbrush if that's what you

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:10.729 
a real paintbrush if that's what you
want<00:04:08.519> and<00:04:08.850> get<00:04:09.090> this<00:04:09.299> otherwise<00:04:10.109> in<00:04:10.470> all

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:10.739 
want and get this otherwise in all

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:13.189 
want and get this otherwise in all
honesty<00:04:11.310> the<00:04:11.880> outcome<00:04:12.540> that<00:04:12.720> you're<00:04:12.900> going<00:04:13.139> to

00:04:13.189 --> 00:04:13.199 
honesty the outcome that you're going to

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:15.110 
honesty the outcome that you're going to
get<00:04:13.470> from<00:04:13.799> just<00:04:13.919> using<00:04:14.190> a<00:04:14.489> rubber

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120 
get from just using a rubber

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:19.189 
get from just using a rubber
tip<00:04:15.380> stylus<00:04:16.380> is<00:04:16.560> the<00:04:16.859> same<00:04:17.220> outcome<00:04:18.030> so<00:04:18.660> if

00:04:19.189 --> 00:04:19.199 
tip stylus is the same outcome so if

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:20.569 
tip stylus is the same outcome so if
you're<00:04:19.530> gonna<00:04:19.650> spend<00:04:20.010> a<00:04:20.160> little<00:04:20.340> bit<00:04:20.489> more

00:04:20.569 --> 00:04:20.579 
you're gonna spend a little bit more

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:22.340 
you're gonna spend a little bit more
money<00:04:21.000> for<00:04:21.239> the<00:04:21.359> sensitive<00:04:21.720> stylus<00:04:22.199> because

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:22.350 
money for the sensitive stylus because

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:24.050 
money for the sensitive stylus because
of<00:04:22.680> the<00:04:22.800> double<00:04:23.160> kind<00:04:23.430> of<00:04:23.520> thing<00:04:23.669> that<00:04:23.699> it<00:04:23.910> has

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.060 
of the double kind of thing that it has

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:24.740 
of the double kind of thing that it has
going<00:04:24.300> on

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:24.750 
going on

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:27.710 
going on
you'd<00:04:25.320> probably<00:04:25.590> would<00:04:26.130> do<00:04:26.910> fine<00:04:27.240> with<00:04:27.510> some

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:27.720 
you'd probably would do fine with some

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:29.420 
you'd probably would do fine with some
of<00:04:27.900> the<00:04:27.960> more<00:04:28.139> cheaper<00:04:28.530> styli<00:04:28.979> that<00:04:29.190> are<00:04:29.280> out

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:29.430 
of the more cheaper styli that are out

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:31.100 
of the more cheaper styli that are out
there<00:04:29.669> and<00:04:29.850> I<00:04:29.970> believe<00:04:30.360> that's<00:04:30.600> the<00:04:30.690> plural

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:31.110 
there and I believe that's the plural

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:35.330 
there and I believe that's the plural
styler<00:04:31.710> um<00:04:32.520> but<00:04:33.030> yeah<00:04:33.810> it's<00:04:34.740> a<00:04:34.830> really<00:04:35.160> nice

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:35.340 
styler um but yeah it's a really nice

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:37.610 
styler um but yeah it's a really nice
stylus<00:04:35.850> like<00:04:36.300> I<00:04:36.389> said<00:04:36.570> the<00:04:36.750> weight<00:04:36.960> is<00:04:37.470> very

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:37.620 
stylus like I said the weight is very

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:39.830 
stylus like I said the weight is very
nice<00:04:38.010> and<00:04:38.280> then<00:04:38.400> when<00:04:38.610> you<00:04:38.699> open<00:04:38.729> it<00:04:39.090> up<00:04:39.240> it<00:04:39.690> has

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:39.840 
nice and then when you open it up it has

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:42.110 
nice and then when you open it up it has
this<00:04:40.110> rubber<00:04:40.350> grip<00:04:40.800> so<00:04:41.040> it's<00:04:41.160> even<00:04:41.729> that<00:04:41.760> much

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:42.120 
this rubber grip so it's even that much

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:46.430 
this rubber grip so it's even that much
more<00:04:43.040> mimicking<00:04:44.040> a<00:04:44.220> real<00:04:44.580> paintbrush<00:04:45.419> but<00:04:46.169> in

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:46.440 
more mimicking a real paintbrush but in

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:47.900 
more mimicking a real paintbrush but in
all<00:04:46.590> fairness<00:04:47.130> to<00:04:47.340> it

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:47.910 
all fairness to it

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:50.570 
all fairness to it
I<00:04:47.940> don't<00:04:48.750> really<00:04:49.080> seeing<00:04:49.440> this<00:04:49.680> catch<00:04:49.979> on<00:04:50.280> even

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:50.580 
I don't really seeing this catch on even

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:53.420 
I don't really seeing this catch on even
even<00:04:50.880> with<00:04:51.030> avid<00:04:51.600> painter<00:04:52.139> so<00:04:52.590> and<00:04:52.770> I<00:04:52.919> had<00:04:53.400> a

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:53.430 
even with avid painter so and I had a

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:56.270 
even with avid painter so and I had a
painter<00:04:54.090> my<00:04:54.419> wife<00:04:54.630> as<00:04:54.810> an<00:04:54.930> artist<00:04:55.289> I<00:04:55.500> had<00:04:56.100> her

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:56.280 
painter my wife as an artist I had her

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:59.719 
painter my wife as an artist I had her
tested<00:04:56.550> out<00:04:56.880> and<00:04:57.090> yeah<00:04:57.840> it's<00:04:58.229> fun<00:04:58.350> but<00:04:59.250> because

00:04:59.719 --> 00:04:59.729 
tested out and yeah it's fun but because

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:02.060 
tested out and yeah it's fun but because
of<00:04:59.910> mimics<00:05:00.389> a<00:05:00.510> paintbrush<00:05:00.810> but<00:05:01.169> you<00:05:01.590> don't<00:05:01.770> see
