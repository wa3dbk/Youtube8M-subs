00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.990

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.040
 perennial bananas taken away 

00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:14.639
 I have it in the last video ever 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:17.039
 said overloaded at lidl and aldi the 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.600

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.480

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:25.920
 not but I was always again 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:29.310
 just all the young states nothing 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:31.070
 brought I have ever or vegetables 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:35.250
 already brought me with it 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:38.640
 Of course, a little funny stuff 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.500
 with engine power lecithin sugar 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:44.540
 I do not know, and so on everyone 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.540
 case this is a classic story 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:57.350
 based in order to tomatoes yes now 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:01.630
 we are in fact already said evans 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:04.309
 shopping and red thai curry 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:05.840
 coconut milk from alnatura the horny at 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:10.850
 the coconut milk from a tour is the 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:13.390
 free even after time already 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:15.619
 two euros but you have just synonymous 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:17.210
 coconut and water separates that 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:18.770
 it had been yes with the other one 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:19.790
 still analogues and other factors 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:23.479
 stories with them 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:25.130
 this will save the two things next to it 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:28.970
 By the way, for the dough I hear that 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:30.800
 Then I myself was then cinema 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:33.860
 again turning I sometimes 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:36.080
 kidney beans are needed again 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:37.399
 still from the aldi if no I have 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:38.690
 forget the dry kidney beans 

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:39.890
 that's why I have 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:42.080
 took 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:44.030
 a mango which there is then also 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:45.289
 I have followed mango again 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:48.229
 moment there is no way somehow 

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:50.810
 good big and small now too 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:57.979
 even the arrabiata sauce also fast 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:59.899
 sometimes it has to go from alnatura 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:01.399
 Sun rice waffles are used to camera eyes 

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:03.979
 Mom eat you are also stayed free 

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:06.080
 you know, I do my cluj 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:08.569
 Then I have two rice drinking nature 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:10.810
 taken along that's just cool yes 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:13.010
 There is nothing in it purely vegetable 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:17.450
 is it a whole bunch convincing it 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:22.550
 what's wrong with everything is also here 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:24.650
 always and brought here so flakes 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:26.510
 So if you know where it really is 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:28.610
 so right here so flakes are there says 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:31.060
 I know because they flake here 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:33.349
 are now not so the upper further 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:35.450
 and then we have two more here 

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:37.700
 buckwheat yes as I said for the 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:39.800
 Gluten check and buckwheat is also great 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:42.140
 cool still has ten grams of protein, yes 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:45.680
 those who flake here also have ten 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:48.349
 yes, this is because it is 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:51.080
 good but it is not that is not 

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:53.870
 the grain of the senses but pseudo 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:55.790
 cereals have good free and book continues 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.709
 really good properties so there you can 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:58.879
 google it if you want it 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:01.069
 not thought that's actually 

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:04.040
 say just as little as quinoa 

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:07.340
 amaranth things are also good 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:09.230
 but spelled are calling yes in general 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:10.430
 is making extra knots video what im 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:12.439
 moment already gone 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:14.209
 we'll probably see that then 

00:03:12.439 --> 00:03:15.469
 before you buy it after that you have to 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:17.329
 Let's see how it is online right now 

00:03:15.469 --> 00:03:19.329
 brings with it that was again a purchase 

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:22.340
 tegut and all the factors seen 

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:23.480
 were 27 euros was a bit more expensive 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:25.670
 but first of all alone the two 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:29.329
 buckwheat or here we are together 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:29.930
 Eight Euros cost 10 Euros to 12 Euros 

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:33.230
 50 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:35.780
 So cheap so you just have to 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:38.750
 let's see it and the cinema from 105 euro 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:40.129
