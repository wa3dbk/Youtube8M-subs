00:01:14.429 --> 00:01:14.439 
me really think about which source

00:01:14.439 --> 00:01:16.080 
me really think about which source
protein<00:01:14.770> I<00:01:14.950> want<00:01:15.280> to<00:01:15.369> eat<00:01:15.520> you<00:01:15.909> know<00:01:16.000> I'm

both<00:01:20.950> of<00:01:21.159> them<00:01:21.310> are<00:01:21.460> good<00:01:21.640> source<00:01:21.909> of<00:01:22.030> protein

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:22.600 
both of them are good source of protein

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.819 
both of them are good source of protein
matter<00:01:23.439> of<00:01:23.530> fact<00:01:23.590> beef<00:01:24.159> itself<00:01:25.119> can<00:01:26.110> be<00:01:26.409> just

00:01:26.819 --> 00:01:26.829 
matter of fact beef itself can be just

00:01:26.829 --> 00:01:29.730 
matter of fact beef itself can be just
as<00:01:27.040> low<00:01:27.250> in<00:01:27.400> fat<00:01:27.700> and<00:01:28.000> that<00:01:28.960> if<00:01:29.140> not<00:01:29.350> that<00:01:29.560> it

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:29.740 
as low in fat and that if not that it

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:32.160 
as low in fat and that if not that it
provides<00:01:30.070> you<00:01:30.250> more<00:01:30.310> zinc<00:01:30.909> more<00:01:31.509> iron<00:01:31.810> and
