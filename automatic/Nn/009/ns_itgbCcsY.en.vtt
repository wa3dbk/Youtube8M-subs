00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:04.650
 I liked to boil potatoes with potatoes 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:06.480
 made the day before 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.110
 and percent in the shell allowing it to cool overnight 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:10.829
 can pull 

00:00:10.829 --> 00:00:13.829
 become firmer so I can cut them nicely 

00:00:14.899 --> 00:00:17.329
 So now in the cold state first 

00:00:17.329 --> 00:00:20.329
 and free appeals 

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:30.640
 but take care that the potatoes are as little as possible 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.770
 hurt that I still keep a round of play with mine 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:35.820
 Potato slices Hirschmann 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.460
 and become 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.800
 so i'm all pelled so i can approach then i start now the 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.660
 decisive cut 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:47.750
 Qatar will be practically cutting lengthwise alongside stage divorce 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:50.590
 pick as evenly as possible 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:52.280
 impossible for the potato 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.790
 Biedermann I crumbles in my hand crumbles but is good 

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:59.740
 the whole states 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:06.370
 Spleen beginning park 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:09.590
 Problems have been able to get even slices can break here as well 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:12.840
 Just click here on the board with the big chef's knife 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:14.590
 the peace 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.540
 even slices 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:20.540
 measure and cut off 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:28.180
 or if you completely 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:30.090
 has big thick potatoes 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.090
 the disks just get too big bigger than the others 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.080
 yes still cut my half 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:40.080
 and then 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.880
 I've got all my potatoes sliced ​​and now 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:00.980
 can now go to it 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:04.260
 At the construction of a breakdown to fry I have to first with the here 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.260
 Potash Meissen Parnet leave 

00:02:13.139 --> 00:02:16.290
 and the second set way was very high, that is because of hidden 

00:02:16.289 --> 00:02:18.119
 Plaster with black paint color 

00:02:18.119 --> 00:02:19.879
 that's why very well suited 

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:23.249
 Roetgen for a long time to roast 

00:02:23.249 --> 00:02:25.829
 when the lard is hot 

00:02:25.829 --> 00:02:28.039
 not every potato was to us 

00:02:28.039 --> 00:02:32.789
 in portions it only means so much the set offered with 

00:02:32.789 --> 00:02:35.789
 Potato slices is covered 

00:02:36.969 --> 00:02:41.239
 So all the broken slices will get the same amount of brown evenly 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:43.099
 can be 

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:45.669
 before you have a little patience now 

00:02:45.669 --> 00:02:50.919
 From each side here you pay in the hot pan to let costs and 

00:02:50.919 --> 00:02:53.169
 then be careful 

00:02:53.169 --> 00:02:54.219
 love you » 

00:02:54.219 --> 00:02:57.400
 Potato peels do not move so much because they should first of a 

00:02:57.399 --> 00:02:57.889
 page 

00:02:57.889 --> 00:03:00.889
 get critical question 

00:03:01.719 --> 00:03:05.129
 From time to time I can see my landlady and look like no other record looks like 

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:18.639
 if I want to turn it over because it's from one side 

00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:20.349
 but have taken five 

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:23.349
 I have to be very careful with the plastic business now 

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:27.279
 really holy 

00:03:27.279 --> 00:03:30.389
 as long as they are not brown on both sides 

00:03:30.389 --> 00:03:32.689
 I am relatively unstable 

00:03:32.689 --> 00:03:35.709
 from woman divorce together there you have to now 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:37.129
 maybe wait a bit 

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:40.129
 to take the hand to help 

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:44.339
 Often it is like that 

00:03:44.339 --> 00:03:45.729
 the vanity 

00:03:45.729 --> 00:03:48.879
 Turned potato slices have the whole solid percent trap of the other 

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:52.459
 Side of the potato I was just a bit more 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:55.459
 from butter to lard again 

00:04:00.659 --> 00:04:04.680
 Photo Schmautz ensure that the heat nicely from the phantom and delivers 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.719
 Opel is transferred 

00:04:06.719 --> 00:04:09.479
 Dieter can become pretty brown 

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:12.180
 Lasted until the man needed »a little patience for it 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:14.009
 Refueled for 8 to 10 minutes 

00:04:14.009 --> 00:04:17.009
 at least 

00:04:18.719 --> 00:04:20.549
 so if the potatoes are coming now 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:23.430
 have turned brown from both sides 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:26.129
 and around that the butter lard Pauli 

00:04:26.129 --> 00:04:29.270
 went over to the potatoes 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:32.249
 Finally, it's quite bitter with butter 

00:04:32.249 --> 00:04:34.689
 there are some good flakes here 

00:04:34.689 --> 00:04:37.460
 I'm just with the if any 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:39.479
 quiet generous 

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:40.810
 and a little trick 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:43.749
 Now do not move the flag but just the butter 

00:04:43.749 --> 00:04:46.610
 leave it alone 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:47.900
 now it is already 

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:51.590
 So this butter foams so nicely on top of the potatoes 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:53.960
 the butter then stopped too 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:57.309
 then I can do that again 

00:04:57.309 --> 00:04:59.590
 all around 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:02.949
 by when 

00:05:02.949 --> 00:05:06.199
 even the butter is evenly distributed he is consultant Top Manchester as not 

00:05:06.199 --> 00:05:09.199
 to forget 

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:13.029
 That's right at the end 

00:05:13.029 --> 00:05:14.930
 Add salt to the potatoes 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:17.790
 the salt ensures that spirits are pulled out of the potatoes 

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:18.950
 that would turn 

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:21.849
 cause the potatoes do not turn brown, but in their own 

00:05:21.849 --> 00:05:24.849
 cook a liquid here 

00:05:28.349 --> 00:05:30.439
 now in the deep potato 

00:05:30.439 --> 00:05:33.279
 crispy brown 

00:05:33.279 --> 00:05:36.279
 They spared my house under rules 

00:05:42.259 --> 00:05:44.809
 on a 

00:05:44.809 --> 00:05:45.849
 Bowl for example
