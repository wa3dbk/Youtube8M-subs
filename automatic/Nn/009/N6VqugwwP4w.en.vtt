think that you should just wear

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:18.770 
think that you should just wear
something<00:02:16.920> because<00:02:17.400> it's<00:02:17.550> in<00:02:17.670> trend<00:02:17.970> there<00:02:18.690> is

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
something because it's in trend there is

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.570 
something because it's in trend there is
something<00:02:19.080> to<00:02:19.110> be<00:02:19.290> said<00:02:19.319> about<00:02:19.680> making<00:02:20.490> a

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
something to be said about making a

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.790 
something to be said about making a
trend<00:02:20.819> work<00:02:21.030> for<00:02:21.240> you<00:02:21.390> or<00:02:21.630> refining<00:02:22.350> your<00:02:22.560> look

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800

trend work for you or refining your look

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
and I think that's just something that

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.420 
and I think that's just something that
comes<00:02:24.270> with<00:02:24.540> trial<00:02:24.780> and<00:02:24.990> error<00:02:25.140> one<00:02:25.680> really

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
comes with trial and error one really

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.280 
comes with trial and error one really
big<00:02:26.790> like<00:02:27.030> watershed<00:02:27.569> moment<00:02:27.930> for<00:02:27.959> me<00:02:28.170> was

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
big like watershed moment for me was

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.050

it's going to go next it's not saying
that<00:02:54.000> just<00:02:54.030> because<00:02:54.300> you<00:02:54.720> put<00:02:54.870> the<00:02:55.019> effort<00:02:55.140> in

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
that just because you put the effort in
