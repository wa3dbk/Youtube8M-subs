00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 for the rest 

00:00:18.409 --> 00:00:21.380
 she was like nationals in the pas-de-calais 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:24.380
 patients and staff are equipped with funny sensors 

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:28.130
 sorts of little tables of numbers that records the least 

00:00:28.129 --> 00:00:29.359
 contact between them 

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:32.460
 these boxes are using an experiment 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:33.400
 unique in the world 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.520
 set up by the ministry the Pastor Institute 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:39.520
 public assistance-paris hospitals it deserves 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:45.240
 albert his goal to better understand the spread of bacteria 

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:49.750
 responsible for nosocomial infections and for the teacher didier guillemot 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:51.030
 who is leading the project 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.490
 the issue is important 

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:54.659
 for the occasion we are given to the site 

00:00:54.659 --> 00:00:57.210
 an infection 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.570
 that we catch in the hospital 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:02.340
 this is a real public health problem 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:07.460
 in this sense what the low mans estimated between 5 and 10% in France but 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:09.320
 also a bit in all European countries 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.409
 for the risk of making a communal water injection in the elite among 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:13.350
 people who go with 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.380
 that obviously poses a liability problem 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.630
 and then when we go to the hospital we do not go to catch up with the fiction 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:25.280
 so take more one of the problems that arises is that the losc these 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.370
 minute bacteria are becoming more resistant to antibiotics 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:32.770
 it is therefore to elucidate the mechanisms of dissemination of these 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:34.330
 resistant bacteria 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:37.660
 that the halliburton project was launched in May 2009 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:41.070
 we are trying to understand basically what is it that makes 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.580
 a bacterium at some point we will have a success since 2004 then 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:46.950
 another one is not going to have 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.970
 what comes into play therefore on this dynamics of the bacteria 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:54.960
 it's several things especially so easy and resistant several things 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.010
 what is the use of antibiotics of course 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:59.500
 and cissÃ© and its 2 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.090
 to be honest, what will make it possible 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.570
 e the fact that this bacteria will be able to pass very very quickly 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:08.810
 in the life of one individual to another then another then another then a 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:10.559
 other child 

00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:12.099
 experiences 

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:14.359
 this year perkins they live alaa 

00:02:14.359 --> 00:02:18.769
 decided to measure the contacts between people actually measuring what makes 

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:19.890
 possible 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:24.490
 the transmission of resistant bacteria between individuals for 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:28.000
 measure contacts with patients and hospital staff 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.709
 bone tip that was equipped with electronic sensors 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:34.819
 these transceivers that can be worn on the arm pendant or 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:38.269
 still in a pocket they were developed by a team from the institute 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:43.499
 National Research Center in Computer Science and Automation directed by eric flury 

00:02:43.499 --> 00:02:46.509
 however the pretenders to find them a microcontroller shows a 

00:02:46.509 --> 00:02:49.270
 little processor like in a cell phone 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:53.110
 find them an adobe title that can send messages on 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:54.619
 the zombies in the air 

00:02:54.619 --> 00:02:55.999
 an antenna 

00:02:55.999 --> 00:02:58.549
 a little memory to see all the data collected during 

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:00.659
 operations 

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:04.069
 a real-time component that allows you to pruner gun every 30 

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:05.519
 seconds before intimate in the game 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:08.169
 and of course as these sensors are autonomous you will find a 

00:03:08.169 --> 00:03:09.579
 drums 

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:11.329
 these people carry a sensor 1 

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:14.329
 for example number 5 who was sitting at number four at the site 

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:17.879
 concocted by the office 5 will send every 30 seconds a message in 

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:21.069
 saying I'm number 5 roughly within a meter perimeter when the 

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:24.069
 nobody so the sensor of a rocket not receive his messages 

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:28.199
 so she's going to be I'm head number and I got a number 5 message 

00:03:29.169 --> 00:03:32.169
 such day at this time so each sensor saves 

00:03:32.719 --> 00:03:35.369
 systematically and regularly periodically every 30 seconds 

00:03:35.369 --> 00:03:38.829
 his environment his environment are what are the gifts they had to 

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:42.919
 proximity through this device contacts between carers and patients 

00:03:42.919 --> 00:03:45.549
 between caregivers and caregivers 

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:50.549
 and between patients and patients we were all recorded 24 hours a day. 7 

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:54.770
 days out of 7 for six months between May and October 2009 

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:59.760
 some of the technologies and hard to accept to a population at 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:00.439
 beginning 

00:04:00.439 --> 00:04:03.779
 and so the first saw the pastry cooks and sidi of media cohade 

00:04:03.779 --> 00:04:04.819
 teeth 

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:08.709
 do you know who I am and who I do not know where I am 

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:11.749
 in the hospital those who had all kinds of his imagination but a 

00:04:11.749 --> 00:04:13.529
 once it has been explained that 

00:04:13.529 --> 00:04:17.889
 so stop and the case itself has it never recorded the 

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:20.370
 name of the person have already made anonymous 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:23.849
 and second to it was explained that this ingenious geolocation 

00:04:25.689 --> 00:04:28.689
 it 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:45.350
 once for the staff and passion was to train it was great 

00:04:45.349 --> 00:04:47.469
 frankly upset 

00:04:47.469 --> 00:04:52.529
 exciting at the moment one of his participations at the height of 90% 

00:04:53.749 --> 00:04:57.349
 more than 800 people who have agreed to integrate this experience 

00:04:57.349 --> 00:04:58.389
 in large scale 

00:04:58.389 --> 00:05:01.479
 and to carry these communicating sensors in their least displacements 

00:05:02.559 --> 00:05:05.490
 in parallel with the inventory of contacts in real time 

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:09.379
 participants are also submitted to a questionnaire every week 

00:05:09.379 --> 00:05:12.460
 to know their consumption of antibiotics 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:16.030
 the five nurses specially set up at berck for the study and of 

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:19.030
 the order are thus responsible for making regular samples 

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:23.250
 the qatari is not the same about her sharing 

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:27.870
 these resistant bacteria but apart contract told in tears decided to 

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:31.180
 to unite with each of the participants of the study that it is personal 

00:05:31.729 --> 00:05:32.550
 patience 

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:36.199
 so throughout the six months to a year we took samples each 

00:05:36.199 --> 00:05:38.520
 week each participant 

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:42.020
 these samples are then analyzed to see if the individuals 

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:44.800
 are carriers or not of potentially resistant bacteria 

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:47.979
 responsible for nosocomial infections 

00:05:47.979 --> 00:05:50.800
 types of microorganisms are given special attention 

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:52.270
 researchers 

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:55.330
 staphylococcus aureus of Enterobacteriaceae 

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:58.199
 methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus 

00:05:58.199 --> 00:06:01.659
 as for them with one of the bacteria most frequently found in the 

00:06:01.659 --> 00:06:04.889
 nosocomial infections while resistant bacteria but even 

00:06:04.889 --> 00:06:07.520
 globally in a common text 

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:11.090
 with the dismiss meticillin-resistant in front of dirk nowitzki 

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:12.539
 attack resistance 

00:06:12.539 --> 00:06:16.809
 these are bacteria for which there are only a few exits of 

00:06:16.809 --> 00:06:20.369
 types who are the ones who practice them not so send us the importance of 

00:06:20.369 --> 00:06:23.780
 to say that Lavalois is trying to minimize% 

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:26.839
 the number of infections that is territories for 

00:06:26.839 --> 00:06:30.589
 and then we also work on rodeo bacteria that are enterococci 

00:06:30.589 --> 00:06:34.639
 resistant third-generation cephalosporin photo that starts to 

00:06:34.639 --> 00:06:37.639
 become points a problem of law 

00:06:38.139 --> 00:06:41.520
 combining the results of the sampling, the questionnaires and 

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:43.180
 sensor records 

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:46.570
 the researchers hope to be able to detail all the steps 

00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:49.710
 of the transmission of these bacterial strains within the hospital 

00:06:51.149 --> 00:06:53.819
 that could bring new lighting 

00:06:53.819 --> 00:06:56.930
 on the spread of nosocomial infections 

00:06:56.930 --> 00:07:00.349
 and suggests important innovations in terms of prevention 

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:04.249
 we could imagine that tomorrow or the day after tomorrow 

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:06.499
 or after almost a month 

00:07:06.499 --> 00:07:11.919
 that led to the very early identification at 2% of the potential 

00:07:11.919 --> 00:07:15.159
 epidemic of such bacteria that is to say at the end of the tracks 

00:07:15.159 --> 00:07:18.610
 will return to find a bacterium whose priority we know to be potential 

00:07:18.609 --> 00:07:19.800
 epidemic quÃ©bec 

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:23.899
 and the last one that uses more magic but% 

00:07:23.899 --> 00:07:28.339
 to take special precautions to develop the risk of 

00:07:28.339 --> 00:07:31.889
 spread of this bacteria I have other passions I'm doing 

00:07:31.889 --> 00:07:34.739
 analyze the millions of data collected during the 6 months 

00:07:34.739 --> 00:07:37.919
 computer scientist and biologists are already at work 

00:07:38.939 --> 00:07:43.389
 but of course it will take time do not expect you so in 2012 

00:07:43.389 --> 00:07:46.389
 to see the publication of the first results 

00:07:50.729 --> 00:07:51.029
 you
