with<00:01:47.209> us<00:01:47.299> of<00:01:47.509> angular<00:01:48.140> rate<00:01:48.409> sensor<00:01:48.860> so<00:01:49.069> if<00:01:49.130> you

00:01:49.209 --> 00:01:49.219 
with us of angular rate sensor so if you

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:51.069 
with us of angular rate sensor so if you
snapped<00:01:49.549> a<00:01:49.700> head<00:01:49.850> back<00:01:50.060> and<00:01:50.600> couldn't<00:01:50.990> find

snapped a head back and couldn't find
volunteers<00:01:51.649> so<00:01:51.950> he's<00:01:52.880> the<00:01:52.969> next<00:01:53.209> best<00:01:53.360> thing

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:54.310

00:02:07.449 --> 00:02:07.459 
accelerometer on Jon's wrist to see how

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:10.029 
accelerometer on Jon's wrist to see how
fast<00:02:07.819> that<00:02:08.030> 19<00:02:08.690> ounces<00:02:08.869> will<00:02:09.440> strike<00:02:09.799> the

so<00:02:12.319> as<00:02:12.470> you<00:02:12.650> swing<00:02:13.069> through<00:02:13.340> it's<00:02:13.819> going<00:02:13.970> to

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
so as you swing through it's going to

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.000 
so as you swing through it's going to
tell<00:02:14.299> us<00:02:14.329> how<00:02:14.630> fast<00:02:15.019> you're<00:02:15.319> going<00:02:15.500> through<00:02:15.860> a

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
tell us how fast you're going through a

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.570 
tell us how fast you're going through a
360<00:02:16.790> degree<00:02:17.030> mode<00:02:17.239> how<00:02:17.900> many<00:02:18.079> feet

as<00:02:19.580> though<00:02:19.819> this<00:02:19.970> is<00:02:20.030> the<00:02:20.300> worst<00:02:20.660> thing<00:02:20.990> that

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:21.020 
as though this is the worst thing that

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:23.650 
as though this is the worst thing that
could<00:02:21.319> happen<00:02:21.500> if<00:02:21.860> a<00:02:21.980> guy<00:02:22.160> was<00:02:22.430> totally<00:02:23.150> made

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
could happen if a guy was totally made

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:26.740 
could happen if a guy was totally made
of<00:02:23.840> evil<00:02:24.560> this<00:02:25.550> what<00:02:25.850> we're<00:02:25.970> gonna<00:02:26.060> see<00:02:26.300> is<00:02:26.450> why

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
of evil this what we're gonna see is why

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:30.250 
of evil this what we're gonna see is why
there<00:02:27.080> are<00:02:27.230> rules<00:02:27.560> in<00:02:27.890> the<00:02:27.980> game<00:02:28.190> we<00:02:28.970> go<00:02:29.260> go

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
there are rules in the game we go go

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:55.920
