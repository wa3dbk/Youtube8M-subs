all<00:03:28.030> cut<00:03:29.030> this<00:03:29.180> off<00:03:29.390> a<00:03:29.420> little<00:03:29.690> bit<00:03:29.900> cut<00:03:30.170> a<00:03:30.200> bit

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:30.440 
all cut this off a little bit cut a bit

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:34.780 
all cut this off a little bit cut a bit
off<00:03:30.530> more<00:03:30.800> because<00:03:31.160> once<00:03:31.459> it's<00:03:32.330> get<00:03:33.190> in<00:03:34.190> here

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.790 
off more because once it's get in here

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:37.750 
off more because once it's get in here
once<00:03:35.330> that<00:03:35.510> get<00:03:35.720> inside<00:03:36.080> there<00:03:36.380> and<00:03:36.670> once<00:03:37.670> I

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:37.760 
once that get inside there and once I

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:43.210 
once that get inside there and once I
guess<00:03:37.940> it's<00:03:38.420> the<00:03:38.510> fabric<00:03:40.209> it's<00:03:41.209> snug<00:03:41.890> it<00:03:42.890> ain't

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:43.220

going nowhere

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:47.979 
going nowhere
it's<00:03:44.330> melech<00:03:44.780> fitted<00:03:46.390> so<00:03:47.390> once<00:03:47.570> you<00:03:47.690> get<00:03:47.810> in

00:03:47.979 --> 00:03:47.989 
it's melech fitted so once you get in

00:03:47.989 --> 00:04:00.730 
it's melech fitted so once you get in
there<00:03:48.290> it's<00:03:48.410> a<00:03:48.560> snug<00:03:48.830> fit<00:03:49.870> so

about<00:04:27.920> doing<00:04:28.480> I'm<00:04:29.480> at<00:04:29.780> the<00:04:29.900> end<00:04:30.080> of<00:04:30.170> rewiring

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:30.620 
about doing I'm at the end of rewiring

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:32.260 
about doing I'm at the end of rewiring
it<00:04:31.000> anyway

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:32.270 
it anyway

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:33.910 
it anyway
come<00:04:32.600> on<00:04:32.750> the<00:04:32.870> end<00:04:32.990> of<00:04:33.110> relocating<00:04:33.830> them

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:33.920 
come on the end of relocating them

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:39.940 
come on the end of relocating them
anyway<00:04:36.100> relocating<00:04:37.100> it<00:04:37.160> anyway<00:04:37.670> so<00:04:37.700> I<00:04:38.620> think<00:04:39.620> I

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:39.950 
anyway relocating it anyway so I think I

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:41.170 
anyway relocating it anyway so I think I
might<00:04:40.160> just<00:04:40.400> do<00:04:40.610> that

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:41.180 
might just do that

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:42.820 
might just do that
you're<00:04:41.570> probably<00:04:41.720> easier<00:04:42.260> on<00:04:42.350> me<00:04:42.500> just<00:04:42.710> to

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:42.830 
you're probably easier on me just to

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:47.590 
you're probably easier on me just to
