these small bleeder cups even these
little<00:00:36.989> magnetic<00:00:37.320> ones<00:00:37.680> and<00:00:37.920> sometimes<00:00:38.520> I

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
little magnetic ones and sometimes I

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:42.860 
little magnetic ones and sometimes I
resort<00:00:39.360> to<00:00:39.600> a<00:00:39.629> hose<00:00:40.290> in<00:00:40.500> a<00:00:40.590> jar<00:00:40.890> but<00:00:41.850> this<00:00:42.690> is

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
resort to a hose in a jar but this is

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.770 
resort to a hose in a jar but this is
messy<00:00:43.320> it's<00:00:43.500> dirty<00:00:43.829> and<00:00:44.129> it's<00:00:44.579> not<00:00:44.820> efficient

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
messy it's dirty and it's not efficient

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.860 
messy it's dirty and it's not efficient
and<00:00:45.899> fast<00:00:46.260> so<00:00:47.100> I<00:00:47.129> said<00:00:47.489> about<00:00:47.700> okay<00:00:48.420> what<00:00:48.719> do<00:00:48.809> I

and fast so I said about okay what do I
need<00:00:49.399> to<00:00:50.399> really<00:00:50.789> capture<00:00:51.270> that<00:00:51.840> old<00:00:52.170> fluid

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
need to really capture that old fluid

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.470 
need to really capture that old fluid
coming<00:00:53.219> out<00:00:53.520> of<00:00:53.760> each<00:00:53.910> one<00:00:53.940> of<00:00:54.180> the<00:00:54.300> brake

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
coming out of each one of the brake

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.930 
coming out of each one of the brake
calipers<00:00:54.930> and<00:00:55.110> there<00:00:55.680> were<00:00:55.770> two<00:00:55.980> criteria<00:00:56.730> for

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
calipers and there were two criteria for

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.770 
calipers and there were two criteria for
me<00:00:57.059> number<00:00:57.420> one<00:00:57.629> I<00:00:57.870> needed<00:00:58.590> to<00:00:58.890> see<00:00:59.250> when<00:01:00.180> the

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
me number one I needed to see when the

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.680 
me number one I needed to see when the
fluid<00:01:01.079> started<00:01:01.590> to<00:01:01.739> run<00:01:01.980> clear<00:01:02.640> and<00:01:03.090> number

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
fluid started to run clear and number

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.410 
fluid started to run clear and number
two<00:01:03.870> I<00:01:03.899> needed<00:01:04.500> enough<00:01:04.799> capacity<00:01:05.390> so<00:01:06.390> that

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
two I needed enough capacity so that

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.600 
two I needed enough capacity so that
they<00:01:06.659> didn't<00:01:06.960> have<00:01:06.990> to<00:01:07.229> stop<00:01:07.710> after<00:01:08.010> every

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
they didn't have to stop after every

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.760 
they didn't have to stop after every
wheel<00:01:09.060> and<00:01:09.390> pour<00:01:09.720> the<00:01:09.900> brake<00:01:10.110> fluid<00:01:10.140> out<00:01:10.530> into

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
wheel and pour the brake fluid out into

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.340 
wheel and pour the brake fluid out into
some<00:01:10.950> bottle<00:01:11.400> and<00:01:11.610> risk<00:01:11.909> the<00:01:12.090> chance<00:01:12.119> of<00:01:12.659> you

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
some bottle and risk the chance of you

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.140 
some bottle and risk the chance of you
know<00:01:13.470> kicking<00:01:13.740> over<00:01:14.040> I<00:01:14.159> wanted<00:01:14.640> a<00:01:14.700> container

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
know kicking over I wanted a container

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.320 
know kicking over I wanted a container
that<00:01:15.840> would<00:01:16.020> do<00:01:16.470> a<00:01:16.500> complete<00:01:17.220> brake<00:01:17.790> flush<00:01:18.090> on

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
that would do a complete brake flush on

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.170 
that would do a complete brake flush on
all<00:01:18.659> four<00:01:19.110> wheels<00:01:19.640> let<00:01:20.640> me<00:01:20.729> show<00:01:20.909> you<00:01:21.030> what<00:01:21.150> I

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
all four wheels let me show you what I

came up with I pumped the bleeder up to
about<00:01:23.909> 10<00:01:24.240> psi<00:01:24.780> max<00:01:25.200> don't<00:01:26.189> go<00:01:26.369> over<00:01:26.670> that<00:01:27.330> when

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
about 10 psi max don't go over that when

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.069 
about 10 psi max don't go over that when
doing<00:01:27.780> these<00:01:28.049> old<00:01:28.290> cars<00:01:28.619> and<00:01:29.119> note<00:01:30.119> I've<00:01:30.360> added

now note that I always remove this cap

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.130 
now note that I always remove this cap
here<00:02:08.429> to<00:02:08.610> keep<00:02:08.729> from<00:02:08.940> pressurizing<00:02:09.720> this

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
here to keep from pressurizing this

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.470 
here to keep from pressurizing this
capture<00:02:10.649> bottle<00:02:11.009> when<00:02:11.160> I'm<00:02:11.280> bleeding<00:02:11.730> and<00:02:11.849> I'm

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
capture bottle when I'm bleeding and I'm

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.760 
capture bottle when I'm bleeding and I'm
only<00:02:12.690> going<00:02:12.900> to<00:02:12.989> open<00:02:13.230> this<00:02:13.379> up

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
only going to open this up

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.790 
only going to open this up
a half<00:02:14.070> a<00:02:14.190> turn<00:02:14.490> and<00:02:15.480> you<00:02:15.600> can<00:02:15.630> see<00:02:16.050> the<00:02:16.470> fluid

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
a half a turn and you can see the fluid

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.160 
a half a turn and you can see the fluid
coming<00:02:17.070> in<00:02:17.340> the<00:02:17.760> little<00:02:18.000> pre<00:02:18.210> chamber<00:02:18.600> here<00:02:19.020> a

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
coming in the little pre chamber here a

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.680 
coming in the little pre chamber here a
note<00:02:20.160> it's<00:02:20.340> already<00:02:20.760> clean<00:02:21.120> because<00:02:21.150> the

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
note it's already clean because the

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.870 
note it's already clean because the
dirty<00:02:21.930> fluid<00:02:22.560> has<00:02:22.800> already<00:02:23.130> rotted<00:02:23.520> out<00:02:23.610> and

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
dirty fluid has already rotted out and

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.080 
dirty fluid has already rotted out and
down<00:02:24.030> into<00:02:24.270> the<00:02:24.420> bottom<00:02:24.870> so<00:02:25.560> this

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
down into the bottom so this

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:28.400 
down into the bottom so this
accomplishes<00:02:27.090> that<00:02:27.300> objective<00:02:27.960> of<00:02:28.140> being

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
accomplishes that objective of being

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.500 
accomplishes that objective of being
able<00:02:28.530> to<00:02:28.680> see<00:02:28.980> when<00:02:29.340> I've<00:02:29.460> got<00:02:29.670> clean<00:02:30.030> fluid

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
able to see when I've got clean fluid

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.600 
able to see when I've got clean fluid
coming<00:02:31.260> out<00:02:31.470> of<00:02:31.620> the<00:02:31.710> brake<00:02:31.920> caliper<00:02:32.400> and

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
being one litre in size it's big enough

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.030 
being one litre in size it's big enough
that<00:02:35.880> I<00:02:35.940> can<00:02:36.180> do<00:02:36.330> all<00:02:36.540> four<00:02:36.870> wheels<00:02:37.020> I<00:02:37.380> always

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
that I can do all four wheels I always

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.160 
that I can do all four wheels I always
do<00:02:38.430> a<00:02:38.460> little<00:02:38.760> bit<00:02:38.880> more<00:02:39.090> of<00:02:39.210> flush<00:02:39.510> on<00:02:39.780> the

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
do a little bit more of flush on the

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:41.960 
do a little bit more of flush on the
first<00:02:40.440> wheel<00:02:40.710> because<00:02:41.130> you're<00:02:41.670> going<00:02:41.760> to<00:02:41.850> be

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
first wheel because you're going to be

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:43.730 
first wheel because you're going to be
getting<00:02:42.090> a<00:02:42.270> lot<00:02:42.450> of<00:02:42.510> that<00:02:42.720> crud<00:02:43.110> out<00:02:43.320> of<00:02:43.380> the

brake<00:02:44.160> master<00:02:44.430> cylinder<00:02:44.910> reservoir<00:02:45.350> so<00:02:46.350> I'll

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
brake master cylinder reservoir so I'll

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.070 
brake master cylinder reservoir so I'll
go<00:02:46.560> ahead<00:02:46.590> close<00:02:47.400> this<00:02:47.640> one<00:02:47.820> off<00:02:48.000> this<00:02:48.870> one's

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
go ahead close this one off this one's
