okay<00:00:09.820> now<00:00:10.299> the<00:00:10.360> technique<00:00:10.929> I'm<00:00:11.080> going<00:00:11.110> to

00:00:11.249 --> 00:00:11.259 
okay now the technique I'm going to

00:00:11.259 --> 00:00:12.659 
okay now the technique I'm going to
share<00:00:11.410> with<00:00:11.559> you<00:00:11.679> is<00:00:11.769> called<00:00:11.980> coils<00:00:12.459> this

00:00:12.659 --> 00:00:12.669 
share with you is called coils this

00:00:12.669 --> 00:00:14.430 
share with you is called coils this
comes<00:00:12.969> from<00:00:13.120> the<00:00:13.269> 80s<00:00:13.660> when<00:00:13.839> we<00:00:13.929> used<00:00:14.110> to<00:00:14.200> take

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:14.440 
comes from the 80s when we used to take

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:17.099 
comes from the 80s when we used to take
hair<00:00:15.009> we<00:00:15.190> put<00:00:15.400> it<00:00:15.490> into<00:00:15.610> a<00:00:15.730> ponytail<00:00:16.150> and<00:00:16.599> then

00:00:17.099 --> 00:00:17.109 
hair we put it into a ponytail and then

00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:19.050 
hair we put it into a ponytail and then
we<00:00:17.230> gel<00:00:17.680> the<00:00:17.830> ponytail<00:00:18.340> then<00:00:18.760> we<00:00:18.880> take<00:00:19.000> a

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:19.060 
we gel the ponytail then we take a

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:20.580 
we gel the ponytail then we take a
little<00:00:19.180> sections<00:00:19.720> and<00:00:19.869> we<00:00:19.929> twist<00:00:20.140> twist<00:00:20.439> twist

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:20.590 
little sections and we twist twist twist

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:22.830 
little sections and we twist twist twist
and<00:00:20.920> it<00:00:21.220> would<00:00:21.310> coil<00:00:21.580> back<00:00:21.849> on<00:00:22.090> itself<00:00:22.420> and

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:22.840 
and it would coil back on itself and

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:24.060 
and it would coil back on itself and
then<00:00:22.990> you<00:00:23.109> end<00:00:23.259> up<00:00:23.349> with<00:00:23.470> a<00:00:23.500> little<00:00:23.740> shenyang

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:24.070 
then you end up with a little shenyang

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:26.099 
then you end up with a little shenyang
of<00:00:24.400> these<00:00:24.939> little<00:00:25.179> coils<00:00:25.539> what<00:00:25.900> we're<00:00:25.990> going

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:26.109 
of these little coils what we're going

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:27.720 
of these little coils what we're going
to<00:00:26.140> do<00:00:26.320> with<00:00:26.500> it<00:00:26.650> is<00:00:26.800> we're<00:00:26.980> going<00:00:27.070> to<00:00:27.130> use<00:00:27.189> it

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:27.730 
to do with it is we're going to use it

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:29.909 
to do with it is we're going to use it
and<00:00:27.939> use<00:00:28.150> it<00:00:28.330> like<00:00:28.449> a<00:00:28.509> braiding<00:00:28.960> motion<00:00:29.380> we

00:00:29.909 --> 00:00:29.919 
and use it like a braiding motion we

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:32.400 
and use it like a braiding motion we
take<00:00:30.099> a<00:00:30.130> diagonal<00:00:30.519> forward<00:00:30.880> section<00:00:31.449> okay<00:00:32.140> and

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:32.410 
take a diagonal forward section okay and

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:34.560 
take a diagonal forward section okay and
we<00:00:32.620> twist<00:00:32.860> towards<00:00:33.220> the<00:00:33.310> face<00:00:33.520> I<00:00:33.820> place<00:00:34.300> where

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:34.570 
we twist towards the face I place where

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:36.720 
we twist towards the face I place where
I<00:00:34.600> want<00:00:34.840> that<00:00:34.930> to<00:00:35.080> lay<00:00:35.380> so<00:00:35.950> I<00:00:35.980> want<00:00:36.220> that<00:00:36.400> to<00:00:36.580> lay

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:47.050 
to lay I slice to that I bring it

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:49.770 
to lay I slice to that I bring it
underneath<00:00:47.350> and<00:00:47.800> I<00:00:48.790> wrap<00:00:49.060> it<00:00:49.270> towards<00:00:49.540> sorts

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:49.780 
underneath and I wrap it towards sorts

underneath and I wrap it towards sorts
of<00:00:49.840> face<00:00:50.080> so<00:00:50.320> this<00:00:50.500> gets<00:00:50.650> wrapped<00:00:50.950> towards<00:00:51.250> the

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:51.370 
of face so this gets wrapped towards the

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:53.940 
of face so this gets wrapped towards the
face<00:00:51.580> okay<00:00:52.570> I<00:00:52.750> place<00:00:53.080> it<00:00:53.260> where<00:00:53.380> I<00:00:53.410> want<00:00:53.710> I

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:56.710 
slice up to that point and I wrap to the

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:58.740 
slice up to that point and I wrap to the
face<00:00:56.920> now<00:00:57.580> once<00:00:57.790> I've<00:00:58.000> wrapped<00:00:58.240> to<00:00:58.390> the<00:00:58.510> face

how its narrowing down see I went too
wide<00:04:25.979> too<00:04:26.310> narrow<00:04:26.580> because<00:04:26.970> the<00:04:27.180> head<00:04:27.360> does

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 
wide too narrow because the head does

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.840
