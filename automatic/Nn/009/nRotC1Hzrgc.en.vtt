00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
tricky because the EDF unit is right

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:31.710

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
epoxy on here so I could miss this area

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.050 
epoxy on here so I could miss this area
so<00:02:34.180> I'm<00:02:34.269> gonna<00:02:34.360> put<00:02:34.599> a<00:02:34.989> pocket<00:02:35.379> here<00:02:35.950> an<00:02:36.670> epoxy
