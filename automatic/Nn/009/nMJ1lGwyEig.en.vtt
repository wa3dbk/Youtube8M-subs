00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
all conditioner really does is softens

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:38.179 
all conditioner really does is softens
your<00:01:36.180> hair<00:01:36.479> so<00:01:36.869> that<00:01:37.020> you<00:01:37.049> can<00:01:37.350> comb<00:01:37.590> it<00:01:37.619> so<00:01:38.130> you

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
your hair so that you can comb it so you

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:41.510 
your hair so that you can comb it so you
can<00:01:38.340> comb<00:01:38.549> through<00:01:38.850> it<00:01:39.770> and<00:01:40.770> obviously<00:01:41.040> it's

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
can comb through it and obviously it's

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.030 
can comb through it and obviously it's
temporary<00:01:42.090> since<00:01:42.450> most<00:01:42.780> in<00:01:43.110> most<00:01:43.380> cases<00:01:43.710> you

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
temporary since most in most cases you

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.620 
temporary since most in most cases you
rinse<00:01:44.369> it<00:01:44.579> out<00:01:44.759> unless<00:01:45.030> it's<00:01:45.299> a<00:01:45.390> leave-in

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
rinse it out unless it's a leave-in

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.069 
rinse it out unless it's a leave-in
conditioner<00:01:46.439> of<00:01:46.590> course<00:01:46.939> but<00:01:47.939> that's<00:01:48.630> really

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
conditioner of course but that's really

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.920 
conditioner of course but that's really
it<00:01:49.409> and<00:01:49.970> also<00:01:50.970> she<00:01:51.060> went<00:01:51.420> on<00:01:51.509> and<00:01:51.689> talked<00:01:51.810> about

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
it and also she went on and talked about

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.980 
it and also she went on and talked about
in<00:01:52.229> the<00:01:52.350> post<00:01:52.590> how<00:01:52.920> after<00:01:53.759> about<00:01:54.119> 10<00:01:54.420> to<00:01:54.570> 15

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
in the post how after about 10 to 15

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.429 
in the post how after about 10 to 15
minutes<00:01:55.610> your<00:01:56.610> hair<00:01:56.850> has<00:01:57.060> absolved<00:01:57.450> absorbed

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
minutes your hair has absolved absorbed

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.050 
minutes your hair has absolved absorbed
all<00:01:58.590> that<00:01:58.649> it's<00:01:58.979> gonna<00:01:59.159> absorb<00:01:59.340> of<00:01:59.939> a

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
all that it's gonna absorb of a

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.289 
all that it's gonna absorb of a
conditioner<00:02:00.719> so<00:02:01.409> really<00:02:01.890> anything<00:02:02.280> past<00:02:02.759> 15

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
conditioner so really anything past 15

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.660 
conditioner so really anything past 15
minutes<00:02:03.780> you're<00:02:03.990> not<00:02:04.229> gaining<00:02:05.219> any

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
minutes you're not gaining any

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.190 
minutes you're not gaining any
additional<00:02:06.740> benefits<00:02:07.740> so<00:02:08.369> to<00:02:08.429> speak

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200 
additional benefits so to speak

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.710 
additional benefits so to speak
so<00:02:09.709> once<00:02:10.399> I<00:02:10.520> read<00:02:10.729> that<00:02:10.910> I<00:02:10.970> was<00:02:11.090> playing<00:02:11.420> game

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
so once I read that I was playing game

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.640 
so once I read that I was playing game
one<00:02:11.990> and<00:02:12.349> from<00:02:13.220> then<00:02:13.430> on<00:02:13.760> that<00:02:14.750> was<00:02:15.080> almost<00:02:15.380> two

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
one and from then on that was almost two

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:20.770 
one and from then on that was almost two
years<00:02:15.890> ago<00:02:15.950> I<00:02:16.520> think<00:02:17.180> yeah<00:02:17.950> I<00:02:19.180> haven't<00:02:20.180> deep

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
years ago I think yeah I haven't deep

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:22.690 
years ago I think yeah I haven't deep
conditioned<00:02:21.290> my<00:02:21.440> hair<00:02:21.470> and<00:02:21.950> my<00:02:22.099> hair<00:02:22.130> is

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
conditioned my hair and my hair is

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.350 
conditioned my hair and my hair is
thriving<00:02:23.390> it's<00:02:23.840> growing<00:02:24.730> you<00:02:25.730> know<00:02:25.880> it's<00:02:26.120> good

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
thriving it's growing you know it's good

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.920 
thriving it's growing you know it's good
to<00:02:26.390> go

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
to go

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:30.520 
to go
so<00:02:27.730> that<00:02:28.730> in<00:02:28.970> short<00:02:29.270> is<00:02:29.450> why<00:02:29.630> I<00:02:29.660> don't<00:02:29.870> deep

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
so that in short is why I don't deep

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:32.830 
so that in short is why I don't deep
condition<00:02:31.069> because<00:02:31.489> I<00:02:31.880> have<00:02:32.300> even<00:02:32.510> noticed

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
condition because I have even noticed

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:34.570 
condition because I have even noticed
like<00:02:33.260> even<00:02:33.650> when<00:02:33.709> I<00:02:33.800> leave<00:02:33.980> conditioner<00:02:34.250> on

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.580 
like even when I leave conditioner on

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:36.790 
like even when I leave conditioner on
for<00:02:34.610> ten<00:02:35.000> minutes<00:02:35.390> as<00:02:35.630> opposed<00:02:36.350> to<00:02:36.440> leaving<00:02:36.620> it

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:36.800 
for ten minutes as opposed to leaving it

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.460 
for ten minutes as opposed to leaving it
on<00:02:36.890> for<00:02:36.950> 30<00:02:37.340> minutes<00:02:37.760> my<00:02:38.300> hair<00:02:38.630> doesn't<00:02:39.019> feel

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
on for 30 minutes my hair doesn't feel

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:43.059 
on for 30 minutes my hair doesn't feel
any<00:02:39.980> better<00:02:40.730> or<00:02:41.269> any<00:02:41.360> different<00:02:41.959> it's<00:02:42.530> pretty

00:02:43.059 --> 00:02:43.069 
any better or any different it's pretty

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:45.160 
any better or any different it's pretty
much<00:02:43.250> the<00:02:43.430> same<00:02:43.640> so<00:02:44.000> for<00:02:44.209> me<00:02:44.360> it's<00:02:45.019> about

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
much the same so for me it's about

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.620 
much the same so for me it's about
saving<00:02:45.769> time<00:02:45.800> you<00:02:46.340> know<00:02:46.519> I<00:02:46.850> don't<00:02:47.390> want<00:02:47.569> my

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:47.630 
saving time you know I don't want my

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:50.350 
saving time you know I don't want my
washing<00:02:48.290> day<00:02:48.500> to<00:02:48.560> be<00:02:48.890> taking<00:02:49.790> forever<00:02:50.030> and

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:50.360 
washing day to be taking forever and

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:52.449 
washing day to be taking forever and
five<00:02:50.900> million<00:02:51.230> years<00:02:51.530> from<00:02:52.010> you<00:02:52.340> know

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:52.459 
five million years from you know

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:56.740 
five million years from you know
conditioning<00:02:54.400> so<00:02:55.400> I<00:02:55.819> hope<00:02:56.420> that<00:02:56.450> that

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
conditioning so I hope that that

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:58.990 
conditioning so I hope that that
explanation<00:02:57.350> was<00:02:57.709> helpful<00:02:58.250> but<00:02:58.459> it's<00:02:58.760> pretty

if you leave it on for an hour as

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:31.479 
if you leave it on for an hour as
opposed<00:03:28.489> to<00:03:28.640> 10<00:03:29.269> minutes<00:03:29.799> so<00:03:30.799> yeah<00:03:31.010> so<00:03:31.340> that's

00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:31.489

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:33.610 
opposed to 10 minutes so yeah so that's
why<00:03:31.670> I<00:03:31.700> don't<00:03:31.850> do<00:03:32.030> conditioned<00:03:32.630> and<00:03:33.019> I<00:03:33.470> also

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:33.620 
why I don't do conditioned and I also

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:45.650 
loop do and it is inspired by a

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:47.800 
loop do and it is inspired by a
hairstyle<00:03:46.430> that<00:03:46.579> had<00:03:46.700> beautiful<00:03:46.880> brown<00:03:47.450> baby

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:52.940 
doll actually did a tutorial on um so I

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:55.860 
doll actually did a tutorial on um so I
kind<00:03:53.180> of<00:03:53.269> put<00:03:53.540> my<00:03:53.690> own<00:03:53.870> spin<00:03:54.140> on<00:03:54.319> it<00:03:54.590> she<00:03:54.980> did<00:03:55.310> I

00:03:58.809 --> 00:03:58.819 
have two strand flat twists on both

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:02.140 
have two strand flat twists on both
sides<00:03:59.350> and<00:04:00.350> you<00:04:01.130> can<00:04:01.280> see<00:04:01.430> on<00:04:01.549> the<00:04:01.670> left<00:04:01.910> side<00:04:02.090> I

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:02.150 
sides and you can see on the left side I

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:04.509 
sides and you can see on the left side I
kind<00:04:02.569> of<00:04:02.660> did<00:04:02.870> it<00:04:02.900> a<00:04:03.290> little<00:04:03.829> bit<00:04:04.100> differently

00:04:04.509 --> 00:04:04.519 
kind of did it a little bit differently

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:07.180 
kind of did it a little bit differently
because<00:04:04.670> I<00:04:05.170> started<00:04:06.170> getting<00:04:06.440> tired<00:04:06.590> so<00:04:07.069> I

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:07.190 
because I started getting tired so I

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:09.759 
because I started getting tired so I
just<00:04:07.459> made<00:04:07.609> them<00:04:07.700> bigger<00:04:07.940> and<00:04:08.030> I<00:04:08.239> made<00:04:08.480> them<00:04:08.769> go

00:04:09.759 --> 00:04:09.769 
just made them bigger and I made them go
