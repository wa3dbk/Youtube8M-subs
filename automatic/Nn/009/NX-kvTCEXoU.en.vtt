inches<00:02:11.720> the<00:02:11.900> trick<00:02:12.110> was<00:02:12.320> to<00:02:12.470> get<00:02:12.590> the<00:02:12.680> tire<00:02:12.890> up

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
inches the trick was to get the tire up

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:14.980 
inches the trick was to get the tire up
underneath<00:02:13.430> the<00:02:13.850> spare<00:02:14.060> tire<00:02:14.330> which<00:02:14.960> is

underneath the spare tire which is

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:17.590 
underneath the spare tire which is
always<00:02:15.230> a<00:02:15.350> problem<00:02:15.770> a<00:02:15.950> proper<00:02:16.640> tailgate<00:02:17.120> and

always a problem a proper tailgate and

relation<00:03:41.300> to<00:03:41.330> the<00:03:41.510> rear<00:03:41.690> axle<00:03:41.900> it's<00:03:42.380> in<00:03:42.530> the

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:42.620 
relation to the rear axle it's in the

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:44.640 
relation to the rear axle it's in the
same<00:03:42.800> spot<00:03:43.100> we<00:03:43.220> never<00:03:43.400> knew<00:03:43.580> move<00:03:43.910> the<00:03:44.090> motor

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:44.650 
same spot we never knew move the motor

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:46.920 
same spot we never knew move the motor
of<00:03:45.310> course<00:03:45.550> move<00:03:45.790> the<00:03:45.910> front<00:03:46.150> axle<00:03:46.480> forward

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:46.930 
of course move the front axle forward

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:50.130 
of course move the front axle forward
it's<00:03:47.170> now<00:03:47.440> 117<00:03:48.310> inch<00:03:48.489> wheelbase<00:03:48.760> and<00:03:49.239> the<00:03:49.930> cab

the blanks after that what's cool about

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:59.100 
the blanks after that what's cool about
it<00:03:55.989> is<00:03:56.260> it's<00:03:56.620> a<00:03:56.739> full<00:03:56.950> eight<00:03:57.670> foot<00:03:58.000> box<00:03:58.239> on<00:03:58.720> this
