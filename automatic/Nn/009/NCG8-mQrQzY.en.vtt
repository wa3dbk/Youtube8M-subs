imagine that your hands are moving like

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:18.789 
imagine that your hands are moving like
a<00:04:16.609> school<00:04:17.000> of<00:04:17.030> fish<00:04:17.510> swirling<00:04:18.380> around<00:04:18.500> each

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:18.799 
a school of fish swirling around each

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:19.650 
a school of fish swirling around each
other

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:19.660 
other

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:22.450 
other
escaping<00:04:20.660> from<00:04:20.870> the<00:04:21.109> school<00:04:21.380> and<00:04:21.829> coming<00:04:22.250> back

escaping from the school and coming back

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:24.850 
escaping from the school and coming back
so<00:04:23.389> the<00:04:23.539> first<00:04:23.780> timing<00:04:24.050> variation<00:04:24.740> we're

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:24.860 
so the first timing variation we're

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:29.070 
so the first timing variation we're
going<00:04:25.039> to<00:04:25.130> look<00:04:25.280> at<00:04:25.460> is<00:04:25.669> a<00:04:26.389> slow<00:04:26.990> slow<00:04:27.919> slow

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:29.080 
going to look at is a slow slow slow

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:32.800 
going to look at is a slow slow slow
motion<00:04:30.080> that<00:04:30.110> then<00:04:30.800> releases<00:04:31.490> into<00:04:32.479> a<00:04:32.510> fast

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:32.810 
motion that then releases into a fast

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:35.589 
motion that then releases into a fast
motion<00:04:33.050> I<00:04:33.470> like<00:04:33.860> to<00:04:34.010> think<00:04:34.250> of<00:04:34.340> this<00:04:34.550> as<00:04:34.820> the

00:04:35.589 --> 00:04:35.599 
motion I like to think of this as the

00:04:35.599 --> 00:04:39.730 
motion I like to think of this as the
test<00:04:35.960> and<00:04:36.380> go<00:04:37.280> for<00:04:37.520> it<00:04:37.550> motion<00:04:38.050> imagine<00:04:39.050> you

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:39.740 
test and go for it motion imagine you

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:41.529 
test and go for it motion imagine you
are<00:04:39.950> thinking<00:04:40.490> about<00:04:40.610> getting<00:04:40.940> into<00:04:41.300> a<00:04:41.330> hot

00:04:41.529 --> 00:04:41.539 
are thinking about getting into a hot

00:04:41.539 --> 00:04:43.600 
are thinking about getting into a hot
tub<00:04:41.840> and<00:04:42.080> you're<00:04:42.440> wondering<00:04:42.950> should<00:04:42.979> I<00:04:43.370> step

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:43.610 
tub and you're wondering should I step

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:47.260 
tub and you're wondering should I step
should<00:04:44.389> I<00:04:44.510> step<00:04:44.750> out<00:04:45.080> oh<00:04:45.669> just<00:04:46.669> go<00:04:46.849> for<00:04:47.090> it<00:04:47.120> and

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:47.270 
should I step out oh just go for it and

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:51.820 
should I step out oh just go for it and
you<00:04:47.360> jump<00:04:47.690> in<00:04:49.450> the<00:04:50.450> second<00:04:50.870> timing<00:04:51.110> variation

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:51.830 
you jump in the second timing variation

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:57.219 
you jump in the second timing variation
we'll<00:04:51.979> look<00:04:52.130> at<00:04:52.370> is<00:04:53.080> a<00:04:54.340> fast<00:04:55.340> sharp<00:04:56.229> inhale

00:04:57.219 --> 00:04:57.229 
we'll look at is a fast sharp inhale

00:04:57.229 --> 00:05:02.080 
we'll look at is a fast sharp inhale
type<00:04:57.590> of<00:04:57.770> motion<00:04:58.280> followed<00:04:59.000> by<00:04:59.870> a<00:05:00.229> slow<00:05:01.130> silky

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:02.090 
type of motion followed by a slow silky

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:06.360 
type of motion followed by a slow silky
exhale<00:05:02.720> I<00:05:03.080> like<00:05:04.039> to<00:05:04.160> call<00:05:04.310> it<00:05:04.370> this<00:05:04.970> gasp

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:06.370 
exhale I like to call it this gasp

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:09.370 
exhale I like to call it this gasp
inside
