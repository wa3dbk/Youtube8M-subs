one talk to us so I can tell you how to
fix<00:00:49.170> that<00:00:49.260> common<00:00:49.680> fault<00:00:49.980> it<00:00:50.100> sounds<00:00:50.370> like

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
fix that common fault it sounds like

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.189 
fix that common fault it sounds like

blowing across the top of a milk bottle

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.590 
blowing across the top of a milk bottle
which<00:00:52.649> is<00:00:52.920> a<00:00:53.280> vibration<00:00:54.000> that<00:00:54.090> was<00:00:54.210> caused<00:00:54.449> in

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
which is a vibration that was caused in

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.220 
which is a vibration that was caused in
that<00:00:54.750> inlet<00:00:55.050> it<00:00:55.890> also<00:00:56.039> had<00:00:56.370> a<00:00:56.550> VF<00:00:57.030> 22<00:00:57.510> STI

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230

roller<00:00:58.649> bearing<00:00:59.039> turbo<00:01:00.829> what<00:01:01.829> else<00:01:02.010> I'm

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
roller bearing turbo what else I'm

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:03.920 
roller bearing turbo what else I'm
pretty<00:01:02.879> sure<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.120> model<00:01:03.359> came<00:01:03.510> standard<00:01:03.750> with

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
pretty sure the model came standard with

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.200 
pretty sure the model came standard with
the<00:01:04.049> STI<00:01:04.530> radiator<00:01:05.129> cap<00:01:05.369> but<00:01:05.850> one<00:01:06.000> thing<00:01:06.180> that

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
the STI radiator cap but one thing that

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.760 
the STI radiator cap but one thing that
did<00:01:06.479> make<00:01:06.630> it<00:01:06.659> a<00:01:06.840> bit<00:01:06.990> different<00:01:07.140> is<00:01:07.500> you

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
did make it a bit different is you

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.230 
did make it a bit different is you
notice<00:01:07.920> it<00:01:08.100> doesn't<00:01:08.250> have<00:01:08.369> any<00:01:08.610> ABS<00:01:09.000> the

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
notice it doesn't have any ABS the

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.640 
notice it doesn't have any ABS the
integral<00:01:09.630> of<00:01:09.750> water<00:01:09.930> spray<00:01:10.229> is<00:01:10.439> down

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
integral of water spray is down

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.580 
integral of water spray is down
underneath<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.130> cold<00:01:11.580> air<00:01:11.729> intake<00:01:12.090> for<00:01:12.360> the

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:12.590 
underneath the cold air intake for the

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:14.719 
underneath the cold air intake for the
for<00:01:13.590> the<00:01:13.680> air<00:01:13.860> filter<00:01:14.220> which<00:01:14.340> goes<00:01:14.549> obviously

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
for the air filter which goes obviously

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.550 
for the air filter which goes obviously
around<00:01:15.270> and<00:01:15.420> in<00:01:15.509> through<00:01:15.689> here<00:01:15.960> and<00:01:16.939> whereas

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560 
around and in through here and whereas

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.499 
around and in through here and whereas
the<00:01:19.560> later<00:01:19.740> models<00:01:20.220> obviously<00:01:20.400> eight<00:01:20.880> abs<00:01:21.299> and

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
the later models obviously eight abs and

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.480 
the later models obviously eight abs and
this<00:01:21.570> is<00:01:21.689> where<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:21.960> ABS<00:01:22.380> units<00:01:22.740> act<00:01:23.009> one

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
this is where the ABS units act one

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:24.800 
this is where the ABS units act one
thing<00:01:23.700> I<00:01:23.759> will<00:01:23.970> point<00:01:24.000> out<00:01:24.330> which<00:01:24.509> is<00:01:24.630> not

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
thing I will point out which is not

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.920 
thing I will point out which is not
genuine<00:01:25.200> on<00:01:25.350> this<00:01:25.500> model<00:01:25.799> is<00:01:25.950> the<00:01:26.310> red<00:01:26.930> silicon

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
genuine on this model is the red silicon

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.999 
genuine on this model is the red silicon
boost<00:01:28.200> hose<00:01:28.470> leads<00:01:28.890> I'm<00:01:29.520> at<00:01:29.850> a<00:01:29.880> slightly<00:01:30.420> vary

00:01:30.999 --> 00:01:31.009 
boost hose leads I'm at a slightly vary

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:35.359 
boost hose leads I'm at a slightly vary
variation<00:01:32.009> on<00:01:32.130> the<00:01:33.200> boost<00:01:34.200> control<00:01:34.740> actuator

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
variation on the boost control actuator

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.819 
variation on the boost control actuator
and<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:36.119> map<00:01:36.299> sensor<00:01:36.570> compared<00:01:37.320> to<00:01:37.439> the<00:01:37.530> STI

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
and the map sensor compared to the STI

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.069 
and the map sensor compared to the STI
model<00:01:38.250> but<00:01:38.729> effectively<00:01:39.210> overall<00:01:39.720> it<00:01:39.960> was

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
model but effectively overall it was

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.319 
model but effectively overall it was
what<00:01:40.290> was<00:01:40.619> inside<00:01:41.130> the<00:01:41.400> engine<00:01:41.490> that<00:01:41.939> really

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
what was inside the engine that really

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:43.609 
what was inside the engine that really
did<00:01:42.509> make<00:01:42.689> a<00:01:42.750> big<00:01:43.020> difference

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
did make a big difference

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.310 
did make a big difference
2.2<00:01:44.610> litre<00:01:44.880> obviously<00:01:45.450> a<00:01:45.479> lot<00:01:45.689> more<00:01:45.720> torque<00:01:46.140> in

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
2.2 litre obviously a lot more torque in

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.520 
2.2 litre obviously a lot more torque in
those<00:01:46.500> days<00:01:46.770> but<00:01:47.520> also<00:01:48.259> probably<00:01:49.259> not<00:01:49.409> as

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
those days but also probably not as

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:50.840 
those days but also probably not as
reliable<00:01:49.799> as<00:01:50.070> what<00:01:50.189> Subaru<00:01:50.549> it<00:01:50.610> would<00:01:50.729> have

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
reliable as what Subaru it would have

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.639 
reliable as what Subaru it would have
hoped<00:01:51.090> and<00:01:51.329> this<00:01:51.509> car<00:01:51.750> you<00:01:51.960> need<00:01:52.200> to<00:01:52.409> take<00:01:52.619> a

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
hoped and this car you need to take a

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.950 
hoped and this car you need to take a
lot<00:01:53.070> of<00:01:53.100> careful<00:01:53.820> attention<00:01:54.000> in<00:01:54.509> making<00:01:54.840> sure

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
lot of careful attention in making sure

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.720 
lot of careful attention in making sure
you<00:01:55.079> look<00:01:55.259> after<00:01:55.590> this<00:01:55.770> particular<00:01:56.130> ones

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:56.730 
you look after this particular ones

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:59.120 
you look after this particular ones
about<00:01:57.000> 30,000<00:01:57.660> kilometers<00:01:57.810> on<00:01:58.260> it<00:01:58.380> and<00:01:58.680> has
