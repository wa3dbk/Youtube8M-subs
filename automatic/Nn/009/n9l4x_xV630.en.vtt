 about these lipsticks how to make 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:24.240
 application if it is really dry it 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:27.300

 sale and what is being a fever in the 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.050
 It's true, I've already decided to 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.820
 review I received some lipsticks and I said 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.540
 Let's record more to show the 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:44.610
 coloring that is in the old one in the 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:47.190
 There are and cool girls in these lipsticks 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:50.219
 mate is that you do not have to do much 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:53.250
 That shadow is all elaborate at last. 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:55.320
 only you are going to have to make a 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:58.770
 outlined a basic shadow and passing 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.899
 Hot lipstick is you already have a 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:04.260
 superbike that's why I like it 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:06.479
 Loving the mate and hassan lipsticks was the 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:10.260
 Lipstick is very good is the sequinho 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:13.320
 its durability is very 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:15.210
 You pass it early, you stay with him. 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.820
 for a long time I was going to stay 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.860
 Cool year lipsticks marketing 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.900
 san siro brand the team does not stay 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.810
 cracked because I do not like that 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.729
 button batman so that you pass everything 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.979
 cracked in the mouth and everything to which side 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:31.350
 So this year I do not like it very much. 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:34.020
 I really liked the nine in this question. 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.939
 dry even you make a lot of sense 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.850
 otherwise no finger even comes out 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:41.100
 so what's cool is this brand 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.890
 So, people come and talk and come with me. 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.780
 let's go watch video - the first 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.120
 button, I want to show you these 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:51.660
 from here button 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:55.310
 It's color number 1 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:59.760
 This is the mouth as you can see. 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:02.670
 The mouth is very handsome. 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:07.830
 He is very handsome and on his lips he goes 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:10.380
 keep this result look at it stays 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:12.840
 started out really cool and with makeup 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:16.290
 neutral for example this makeup that 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:19.500
 I'm using it 's a contrast well. 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:21.810
 Nice but he stays a mouth but does not 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:24.360
 that mouth is very light but it is a good 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:27.510
 way rosadinho then it really is 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:30.210
 perfect, I really liked it a lot 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:32.970
 this effect is that it combines 

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:36.900
 any shade shade that you are 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:40.020
 make a second boy button is this 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:41.850
 From here I like to show well together 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:44.820
 with a make-up for you to see how the 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:46.380
 effect and it's cool even just button like 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:51.330
 which draws attention directly to the 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:54.330
 side is to that tone here he is the land 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:57.180
 the number 10 is what you want is 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:03:00.050
 see right this is number 10 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.050
 look that 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:10.650
 he is well so is a brown more earth 

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:15.239
 it is very dark and the effect is 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:17.670
 Lips stay very calm very beautiful 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:20.220
 People are happy to talk, I do not like them very much. 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:23.250
 button more per week 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:26.489
 It's that button tone. It works great. 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:30.569
 It is very nice for those who have the skin 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:33.569
 the white skin until tanned to him 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:35.989
 brunettes is also for those who have skin 

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:39.690
 black the effect of lipstick on lips 

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:43.739
 means very very beautiful clean and the 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:45.930
 next button is the pink lipstick I 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:49.560
 I have loved you enough that you have liked 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:53.400
 very much of that girls button tone 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:04:00.299
 That this is the numbering 3 that is 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:04:05.010
 the gávea and if pink here only looks the tone of the 

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:08.669
 lipstick because beautiful pink chewing gum then 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:11.579
 63 numbering with rose yes is fine 

00:04:08.669 --> 00:04:15.120
 Whiteness the tone of that lipstick 

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:18.150
 pink looks very pretty that highlights 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:24.750
 even call good attention to you have to 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:27.120
 Lighter skin is lighter than many 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:30.330
 The girls asked asked a lot to 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:34.080
 me and it's been such a series that 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:37.560
 lipstick tone too which is the number 9 that 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:41.220
 is the ipanema that lipstick here and it people 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:43.530
 It has made more success, and the girls 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:45.790
 always ask too much for me it's too 

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:49.450
 that purple lipstick you're wearing 

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:50.860
 and such a photo and any agent here and 

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:53.800
 If you will see that I am using that I 

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:55.210
 I have fallen in love with the effect that 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:57.790
 it stays on your lips if you make a 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:59.050
 shadow one that black side passes the lipstick 

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:02.020
 of people 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:04.510
 the makeup is perfect is very good 

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:06.910
 really for you to rock the 

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:10.810
 girl who did not have a penultimate button 

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:12.910
 is this from here the harpooner 

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:15.790
 and if hence the number 5 for you to see 

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:18.010
 is also that it seems an effect is 

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:23.590
 a rose but it is a mixture of a rose 

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:25.660
 even in the middle of watermelon one sees 

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:28.960
 His tone is neither red nor olhão. 

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:30.850
 Pink a little the tone is a bit different 

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:31.630
 It's a common agreement and watermelon I do not know. 

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:37.120
 explain 

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:41.880
 It's up to her, it's a rosebush anyway. 

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:45.010
 here arpoador rosê is that the numbering 

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:48.430
 15 for you to see what a beautiful color 

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:50.500
 I think this is a different color. It's the time. 

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:53.680
 you pass the lips before are 

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:56.830
 with a lipstick it does not even matter 

00:05:53.680 --> 00:06:03.490
 to speak which is the most beautiful among all 

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:06.730
 Is the girl there to close it ? 

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:09.790
 I'm using it now and that's where I'm going with it. 

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:10.990
 the girls asked a lot a lot 

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:14.260
 very much 

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:19.510
 It's time for this button. 

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:23.230
 in mines there are four that is my clothes 

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:26.770
 the purple is and it stays is a he had not 

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:28.120
 folks rolf and get the effect very much 

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:29.449
 pretty for makeup 

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:31.699
 I think 

00:06:29.449 --> 00:06:34.550
 so for evening makeup you want is 

00:06:31.699 --> 00:06:37.879
 a super to close that button tone 

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:41.960

 skin is blonde and be white 

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:47.419

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:49.069
 everton in skin tone it gets the effect 

00:06:47.419 --> 00:06:50.659
 What he says on the lips is a lot of 

00:06:49.069 --> 00:06:52.879
 attention becomes very beautiful 

00:06:50.659 --> 00:06:55.069
