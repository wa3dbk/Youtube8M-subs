00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:24.560
 coffee toy version 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:27.230
 which unknown came to us with 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:30.320
 america and and also also called attic 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:31.279
 toy and primitive its essence is that it 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:33.920
 reminds us 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:36.559
 a toy that let's say in vintage 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:39.530
 does a story she publishes very 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:41.350
 spicy flavor is very important for in 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:44.360
 as Christmas toys to use 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:46.489
 hang on the Christmas tree it will be difficult to smell 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.739
 also in the car you need to hang on the mirror 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:51.859
 and today i would like to tell you about 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:53.269
 how to make coffee toys we were 

00:00:51.859 --> 00:00:56.660
 do it with the following example 

00:00:53.269 --> 00:01:00.050
 cute gingerbread man we 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:04.400
 we take already ready printed pattern and 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:07.040
 we take fabric cotton or white 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.810
 that's how my milky we translate our 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.720
 sound fish i do it 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:12.830
 vanishing marker next we add up 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:16.250
 doubly 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:19.010
 we take our fabric scissors and cut us 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:21.800
 it is necessary to stitch our contour 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:23.570
 the product can be done as manually 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:26.230
 and on a typewriter but now we will do 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:28.610
 do not forget to leave this manually 

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:31.160
 a small piece not stitched in order 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:34.780
 so that we could return our products and 

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:37.070
 so we stitched the contour of our toy 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:40.060
 not necessarily for the need not to forget 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:43.150
 make cuts in the fold places of the nights 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:46.720
 when we turn our toy 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:49.810
 here pull the cloth beautifully very 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:51.880
 cut our products and now through 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:54.280
 left hole we are very 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:58.290
 neatly turn out our ride and 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:02:03.010
 start the picture and gradually gradually 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:05.730
 we stretch the fabric straighten our Christmas trees 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:09.310
 gingerbread heads 

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:11.550
 pay attention to bends 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:15.040
 so we very carefully straighten 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:17.860
 our products are completely won now 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:20.200
 we need to fill it and on this 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:21.790
 stage is still convenient to work with him in appearance 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.860
 toy can be sewn loop 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:28.360
 usually making so small 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:30.310
 toys goes from 40 to minutes to an hour but 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:34.690
 when the hand is already filled with the master already 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:36.970
 Faster so decided our loop now 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:41.590
 it's time to stuff it for stuffing I'm 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:43.930
 using holofiber you can use 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:46.840
 sintepon filling process takes 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:51.190
 quite a lot of time is important here 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:52.120
 tamp tight so then we have here 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:54.910
 these bends 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:56.700
 not dangling and through our holes we 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:59.830
 stuffed starting 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:01.959
 rammed head first were on 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:03.150
 The pens are so important but on top 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:05.280
 naturally 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:07.579
 here we are almost full 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:12.030
 the toy must be tight enough 

00:03:07.579 --> 00:03:14.549
 make sure the pens and the head and and 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:17.400
 the legs were of the same density 

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:20.489
 i'm pretty on white toy and now 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:23.579
 our task is a neat hiding behind 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:26.299
 chef this hole and so is our toy 

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:29.189
 ready for toning now our task 

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:31.079
 prepare a solution for this to us 

00:03:29.189 --> 00:03:33.209
 will need about 100 milliliters 

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:35.069
 water we take 2 and a half spoons 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:37.650
 instant coffee 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:39.959
 but actually you can to your taste 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:41.400
 add if you want more bright 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:43.109
 pronounced taste you can add 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:47.400
 more coffee or more cinnamon frogs 

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:49.889
 name flippers added coffee add 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:54.680
 vanilla sugar per 100 milliliters 

00:03:49.889 --> 00:03:57.180
 about 1 tablespoon and cinnamon here 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:04:00.389
 about the same one tablespoon 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:03.780
 we take a brush and the first layer we 

00:04:00.389 --> 00:04:05.819
 we put pva without glue and just light 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:08.609
 movements but sure promazyvaem 

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:11.220
 you pay special attention to our toy 

00:04:08.609 --> 00:04:13.980
 you have the first layer ready 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:16.260
 our task now is to dry the toy 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:18.690
 it is necessary to dry 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:20.910
 in limbo do it 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:22.590
 can be in two ways or it will dry 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:25.350
 it is natural that it takes some 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:26.040
 amount of time either do it in 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:28.530
 the oven 

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:30.900
 toy must be baked in the oven two 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:31.380
 times the first time we cover with a layer without 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:33.540
 glue 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:35.400
 the solution and the second time in the same 

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:38.490
 solution we add a tablespoon of glue 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:40.550
 in order to fix our smell and 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:43.740
 surface solution 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:47.520
 further our task is to decorate a toy 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:49.860
 This is the most interesting thing I tie 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:53.510
 bow for our little man 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:59.510
 and then I'll simulate the icing on our 

00:04:53.510 --> 00:05:02.010
 gingerbread take the contour and make 

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:04.500
 arbitrary pattern but to give it 

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:05.340
 I enjoy using even more joy 

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:09.120
 rouge 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:10.250
 left to glue the bow and decorate 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:12.770
 buttons 

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:14.509
 our toy is ready 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:17.530
 and you just need to wait when 

00:05:14.509 --> 00:05:17.530
 the contour will dry 

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:35.410

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:35.410
