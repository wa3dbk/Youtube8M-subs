00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
they're long in the way that like the

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.690 
they're long in the way that like the
deviant<00:01:45.090> moon<00:01:45.299> is<00:01:45.600> and<00:01:46.170> so<00:01:46.380> for<00:01:47.040> me<00:01:47.220> anyway

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
it's not possible really to shuffle you

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.200

know<00:01:52.020> in<00:01:52.530> this<00:01:52.829> way<00:01:53.070> so<00:01:53.130> you<00:01:53.490> have<00:01:53.520> to<00:01:53.850> do<00:01:54.030> the

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
know in this way so you have to do the

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.929 
know in this way so you have to do the
kind<00:01:54.479> of<00:01:54.540> long<00:01:54.780> you<00:01:55.530> know<00:01:55.680> up<00:01:56.100> and<00:01:56.340> up<00:01:56.640> and<00:01:56.850> down

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
kind of long you know up and up and down

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.420 
kind of long you know up and up and down
sort<00:01:57.509> of<00:01:57.630> shuffle<00:01:57.840> anyway<00:01:58.560> um

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
sort of shuffle anyway um

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.069 
sort of shuffle anyway um
but<00:01:59.790> that's<00:01:59.969> not<00:02:00.180> really<00:02:00.390> that<00:02:00.420> big<00:02:00.750> of<00:02:00.840> a<00:02:00.930> deal

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
but that's not really that big of a deal

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.709 
but that's not really that big of a deal
I<00:02:01.350> know<00:02:01.530> mine<00:02:01.799> shuffling<00:02:02.219> that<00:02:02.460> way<00:02:02.719> although
