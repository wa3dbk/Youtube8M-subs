00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:18.620
 hello friends with you ford and 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:22.310
 today I want to present your attention 

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:23.230
 review in the style of letsplay game metro last 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:26.330
 light 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:29.000
 i just started playing this 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:32.300
 Wonderful game is going through the first 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.760
 mission playing on medium settings 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:37.730
 because at the maximum game I have 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:41.329
 slows me down radeon 5850 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:44.329
 saying not the newest graphics card therefore 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:47.179
 so it turns out most likely I will soon 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:51.229
 I will change and will play at the maximum 

00:00:47.179 --> 00:00:53.089
 settings I would like to say in 

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:55.280
 first thing even 

00:00:53.089 --> 00:00:59.089
 no maximum graphics settings pro 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:02.929
 high she is wonderfully she is optimized and 

00:00:59.089 --> 00:01:05.119
 everything is really cool also in the game 

00:01:02.929 --> 00:01:07.390
 From the first guilt noticeably that survived 

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:09.860
 the atmosphere of the first part and 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:11.570
 atmospheric stalker we remember everything 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:14.270
 fine that face 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:18.079
 Metro 2033 game was very similar to 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:20.390
 stalker only if the stalker is more 

00:01:18.079 --> 00:01:22.759
 such an open world and we were trails 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:25.030
 more such a script she also plays 

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:29.289
 second part on more wanna script but 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:29.289
 dual plot is better and all that 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:36.070
 see raindrops on 

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:36.070
 help in the decree beautifully everything looks 

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:42.409
 see what the open world will be now 

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:44.450
 remember in the first part the open world was 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:46.159
 not really let the subway inside was 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:51.850
 much more detailed than 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:51.850
 the sphere in the second part now i'm looking 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:58.179
 move the main entrance there comfortable 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:01.159
 I can hold a large position 

00:01:58.179 --> 00:02:04.689
 In the second, in principle, it is already better with 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:10.640
 the outside world is already sunny 

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:13.120
 the graphics are better for me 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.120
 weapon 

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:19.080
 as for weapons, I have a machine gun 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:22.890
 rifle and gun 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:27.659
 you can get the weapons in the game and that's 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:36.239
 repaired his body and all that cool in 

00:02:27.659 --> 00:02:38.159
 Well, I added this sight myself here or 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:40.140
 cartridges can also be preserved in 

00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:43.140
 the game is such a thing as possible with us money 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:46.110
 ammunition that is just no ammo i don't 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.519
 about weaker okay kill them a lot and 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:49.440
 less ammo 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:51.060
 they are stronger but do not go like money then 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:57.180
 there is to buy different weapons 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:03:03.510
 simple cartridges all that is not with the world 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:05.780
 they certainly worked for the glory of the ambulance 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:05.780
 part 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:15.959
 also 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:22.469
 but 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:33.120
 black skirts custody course will do and 

00:03:22.469 --> 00:03:35.870
 that sniper scudo you watch i start 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:40.079
 and the whole three rapana and 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:44.749
 building work returns in the game cool 

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:44.749
 weapons strip from to already interesting 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:48.010
 model 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:56.740
 I play on the average difficulty level 

00:03:54.740 --> 00:04:00.750
 to each 

00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:00.750
 Do you understand me the windowsill is easy 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:07.490
 let's go around the room. 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:18.250
 so it is clear that neither right 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:30.180
 what I really don't like is if 

00:04:28.349 --> 00:04:32.669
 had to need the right to hold 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:34.520
 I'm used to that uncomfortable truth hit her 

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:40.520
 holding onto it again sympathizes 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:40.520
 life is a planet is pressed 

00:05:02.249 --> 00:05:13.599
 whale burrows guys please last time 

00:05:09.879 --> 00:05:15.789
 asked this time too just write 

00:05:13.599 --> 00:05:22.120
 Please in comments that you think on 

00:05:15.789 --> 00:05:24.069
 about what I'm doing a review 

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:26.560
 lately moved in like it up 

00:05:24.069 --> 00:05:28.060
 War is not well, I do not know what 

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:30.279
 side move honest 

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:32.939
 everything seems like such a critique scary 

00:05:30.279 --> 00:05:46.620
 no about my let me play 

00:05:32.939 --> 00:05:46.620
 more information listen to tasks 

00:05:50.310 --> 00:06:13.460
 four already stuck right away me about 

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:13.460
 fuel delivery is certainly quite good here 

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:33.949
 here is a setup of the bases slides 

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:52.309
 as usual, some kind of setup 

00:06:49.999 --> 00:06:52.759
 In general, I understand in general what I want to say 

00:06:52.309 --> 00:06:54.680
 guys 

00:06:52.759 --> 00:06:57.050
 I like the game so far I do nâ€™t know how 

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:59.119
 will be later at the moment it 

00:06:57.050 --> 00:07:00.499
 really good sequel tight 

00:06:59.119 --> 00:07:03.110
 2 in 1 part 

00:07:00.499 --> 00:07:05.360
 yes this is no breakthrough is not innovation but not 

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:08.059
 less I like the game I think it is 

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:09.770
 will be one of the games that i will go for 

00:07:08.059 --> 00:07:11.839
 the last time is full because i'm 

00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:15.559
 really don't remember was the last of us 

00:07:11.839 --> 00:07:17.539
 passed even the same vershok which to me 

00:07:15.559 --> 00:07:20.899
 really liked it can i pass i 

00:07:17.539 --> 00:07:25.699
 I did not pass here in this game I will play 

00:07:20.899 --> 00:07:27.409
 I advise you to go through it and play as well 

00:07:25.699 --> 00:07:29.300
