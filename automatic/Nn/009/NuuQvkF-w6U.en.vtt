00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.030 
took a hundred guys he'd be at the
bottom<00:01:37.229> of<00:01:37.409> the<00:01:37.500> list<00:01:37.680> that<00:01:37.740> would<00:01:37.950> do

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
bottom of the list that would do

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.859 
bottom of the list that would do
something<00:01:38.280> like<00:01:38.340> this<00:01:38.400> in<00:01:38.640> my<00:01:38.759> opinion<00:01:38.869> okay

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
something like this in my opinion okay

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.420 
something like this in my opinion okay
that<00:01:40.290> would<00:01:40.470> then<00:01:40.680> bring<00:01:40.890> me<00:01:41.040> to<00:01:41.250> my<00:01:41.280> next

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
that would then bring me to my next

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.090 
that would then bring me to my next
question<00:01:41.670> because<00:01:42.270> whether<00:01:42.450> you<00:01:42.750> knew<00:01:43.619> jr.

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
question because whether you knew jr.

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.990 
question because whether you knew jr.
met<00:01:44.399> jr.<00:01:45.079> whatever<00:01:46.079> it<00:01:46.259> was<00:01:46.640> when<00:01:47.640> you<00:01:47.759> watch

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
met jr. whatever it was when you watch

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.330 
met jr. whatever it was when you watch
what<00:01:48.210> happened<00:01:48.570> yesterday<00:01:49.340> everybody

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
what happened yesterday everybody

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.940 
what happened yesterday everybody
probably<00:01:50.700> took<00:01:51.149> a<00:01:51.210> step<00:01:51.479> back<00:01:51.720> and<00:01:52.049> you<00:01:52.500> start

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
probably took a step back and you start

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.370 
probably took a step back and you start
to<00:01:53.009> ask<00:01:53.220> yourself<00:01:53.490> the<00:01:54.030> question<00:01:54.060> now<00:01:54.509> why<00:01:54.810> why

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
to ask yourself the question now why why

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.490 
to ask yourself the question now why why
would<00:01:55.439> somebody<00:01:56.159> do<00:01:56.820> something<00:01:56.930> like<00:01:57.930> this<00:01:58.140> I

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
would somebody do something like this I

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.469 
would somebody do something like this I
can't<00:01:59.040> speculate<00:01:59.340> on<00:01:59.490> why<00:01:59.759> he<00:02:00.149> would<00:02:00.360> do

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
can't speculate on why he would do

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:01.670 
can't speculate on why he would do
something<00:02:00.509> like<00:02:00.869> that<00:02:00.930> but<00:02:01.259> i<00:02:01.320> think<00:02:01.350> it

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
something like that but i think it

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.069 
something like that but i think it
caused<00:02:01.979> us<00:02:02.219> to<00:02:02.369> step<00:02:03.180> back<00:02:03.420> and<00:02:03.659> think<00:02:03.719> about

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
caused us to step back and think about

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:05.600 
caused us to step back and think about
how<00:02:04.110> well<00:02:04.469> do<00:02:04.619> we<00:02:04.680> know<00:02:04.740> the<00:02:04.979> people<00:02:05.280> we<00:02:05.399> know
