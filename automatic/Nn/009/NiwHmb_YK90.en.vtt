went on I noticed more and more I was

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.460 
went on I noticed more and more I was
just<00:01:38.820> huffing<00:01:39.820> and<00:01:40.030> puffing<00:01:40.210> and<00:01:40.810> huffing<00:01:40.869> and

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
completed I was breathing normally it

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.700 
completed I was breathing normally it
it's<00:01:56.490> absolutely<00:01:57.420> amazing<00:01:57.710> absolutely

and cardiologists jointly and the reason
for<00:02:04.560> that<00:02:04.619> is<00:02:05.240> surgeons<00:02:06.240> are<00:02:06.360> used<00:02:06.509> to<00:02:06.600> doing

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
for that is surgeons are used to doing

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.570 
for that is surgeons are used to doing
open-heart<00:02:07.080> surgery<00:02:07.619> and<00:02:07.680> know<00:02:07.950> the<00:02:08.130> anatomy

of the aortic valve and we were able to

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:14.449 
of the aortic valve and we were able to
treat<00:02:12.750> complications<00:02:13.500> that<00:02:13.560> may<00:02:13.770> arise<00:02:14.100> as<00:02:14.400> a

treat complications that may arise as a
result<00:02:14.640> of<00:02:14.970> implanting<00:02:15.390> they<00:02:15.510> or<00:02:15.720> to<00:02:15.810> fail<00:02:15.990> and

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
result of implanting they or to fail and

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.140 
result of implanting they or to fail and
cardiologists<00:02:17.400> have<00:02:17.489> experience<00:02:18.000> with

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
cardiologists have experience with

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:19.970 
cardiologists have experience with
catheters<00:02:18.660> and<00:02:18.840> wires<00:02:18.900> and<00:02:19.440> going<00:02:19.650> up<00:02:19.800> through

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
catheters and wires and going up through

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.770 
catheters and wires and going up through
the<00:02:20.070> groin<00:02:20.280> and<00:02:20.670> so<00:02:21.120> each<00:02:21.300> of<00:02:21.390> us<00:02:21.510> brings

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
the groin and so each of us brings

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.840 
the groin and so each of us brings
different<00:02:22.110> things<00:02:22.320> to<00:02:22.620> the<00:02:22.950> procedure<00:02:23.310> so<00:02:23.610> we

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
different things to the procedure so we

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:27.680 
different things to the procedure so we
do<00:02:24.150> them<00:02:24.330> jointly<00:02:24.890> and<00:02:26.150> therefore<00:02:27.150> that<00:02:27.390> it

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
do them jointly and therefore that it

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.990 
do them jointly and therefore that it
gives<00:02:28.260> the<00:02:28.380> patient<00:02:28.500> the<00:02:28.770> best<00:02:28.800> option<00:02:29.370> severe

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
gives the patient the best option severe

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.140 
gives the patient the best option severe
aortic<00:02:30.660> stenosis<00:02:31.200> is<00:02:31.890> a<00:02:31.920> common<00:02:32.459> illness<00:02:32.700> and

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
aortic stenosis is a common illness and

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:35.940 
aortic stenosis is a common illness and
we<00:02:34.239> have<00:02:34.450> a<00:02:34.480> very<00:02:34.780> good<00:02:35.049> treatment<00:02:35.470> for<00:02:35.860> it

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
we have a very good treatment for it

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:38.520 
we have a very good treatment for it
which<00:02:36.099> is<00:02:36.129> surgical<00:02:36.849> York<00:02:37.330> valve<00:02:37.569> replacement

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
which is surgical York valve replacement

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:40.979 
which is surgical York valve replacement
but<00:02:38.920> for<00:02:39.099> many<00:02:39.280> many<00:02:39.519> patients<00:02:39.849> they<00:02:40.629> are<00:02:40.810> not

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:40.989 
but for many many patients they are not

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:43.680 
but for many many patients they are not
able<00:02:41.200> to<00:02:41.409> go<00:02:42.280> through<00:02:42.489> that<00:02:42.730> big<00:02:43.480> heart

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690 
able to go through that big heart

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:45.899 
able to go through that big heart
surgery<00:02:44.170> and<00:02:44.470> so<00:02:44.950> for<00:02:45.129> those<00:02:45.220> patients<00:02:45.519> in<00:02:45.819> the

00:02:45.899 --> 00:02:45.909 
surgery and so for those patients in the

00:02:45.909 --> 00:02:47.339 
surgery and so for those patients in the
past<00:02:46.150> there<00:02:46.420> were<00:02:46.480> really<00:02:46.659> no<00:02:46.780> treatment

00:02:47.339 --> 00:02:47.349 
past there were really no treatment

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:49.949 
past there were really no treatment
options<00:02:47.709> and<00:02:48.400> so<00:02:48.610> this<00:02:48.819> is<00:02:49.000> a<00:02:49.209> less<00:02:49.510> invasive

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:49.959 
options and so this is a less invasive

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:54.199 
options and so this is a less invasive
and<00:02:51.329> allows<00:02:52.329> folks<00:02:52.659> to<00:02:52.840> get<00:02:53.019> back<00:02:53.260> to<00:02:53.440> their

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
and allows folks to get back to their

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:57.869 
and allows folks to get back to their
usual<00:02:55.209> things<00:02:55.720> more<00:02:56.230> quickly<00:02:56.430> and<00:02:57.430> so<00:02:57.640> far

00:02:57.869 --> 00:02:57.879 
usual things more quickly and so far

00:02:57.879 --> 00:02:59.610 
usual things more quickly and so far
we've<00:02:58.030> seen<00:02:58.060> great<00:02:58.450> results<00:02:58.480> the<00:02:59.409> next

00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620 
we've seen great results the next

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:02.789 
we've seen great results the next
morning<00:03:00.190> I<00:03:00.370> saw<00:03:00.849> the<00:03:00.879> food<00:03:01.319> after<00:03:02.319> I<00:03:02.349> had<00:03:02.590> my
