00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:36.180
 from outside the eyelashes 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:37.980

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.670
 false eyelashes 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:58.770

 is so applied to beige pencil pike 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:13.740
 My god gives a lot of support to the beige pencil 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:15.930
 It's water line Make me lipstick 

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:18.180
 cosmetics like leave the milan in the blog 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:20.970
 up that liquid lipstick from the delta to 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:22.920
 leaving a slightly more matte tone that 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:28.019
 lipstick is nude but you can color 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:30.090
 Whatever you want, let's go to the hair and 

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:33.540
 I'll start by applying that look 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:35.550
 candle he is very generous and I apply 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:37.290
 in all the rivers and soon thereafter I 

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:40.019
 I will comb to make the oil 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:41.700
 penetrates every day I will dry 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:43.290
 hair dryer make a little school 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:46.019
 basic 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:48.860
 in the first fight I thought about letting him 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:48.860
 go to you 

00:03:55.270 --> 00:04:00.200
 In this look I thought of something much more 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:02.960
 I then put on a boot or 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:06.170
 vergani she's the one above the knee 

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:08.300
 a high waist shorts and a kimono 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:10.850
 Which I think is super fun. 

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:12.470
 look 6 option also you use the 

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:15.230
 hat but if you do not want not 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:17.600
 research is optional and I left my hair 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:20.750
 smooth but basic even that is a 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:21.920
 Another day, you'll go to some chemistry. 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:25.000
 thing like that 

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:25.000
 I think it gets a lot better 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:43.729
 I chose to do now that I babyliss 

00:04:41.509 --> 00:04:44.720
 I feel more beautiful more powerful with 

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:46.370
 curls 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:48.710
 But you use your hair the way you do. 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:50.419
 I want to make a babyliss more 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:55.550
 I want to make one of the curls 

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:58.449
 bigger and gets rid of the mega I left 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:58.449
 there on the blog too 

00:05:22.689 --> 00:05:28.179
 This is a mid-term look and neither is it 

00:05:25.719 --> 00:05:30.099
 so chic but also not so low 

00:05:28.179 --> 00:05:32.439
 sometimes you want a restaurant but 

00:05:30.099 --> 00:05:34.449
 You're not going to do something very fancy. 

00:05:32.439 --> 00:05:36.339
 Do you want something more stripped down? 

00:05:34.449 --> 00:05:39.099
 I think this dress is wonderful and 

00:05:36.339 --> 00:05:41.739
 finances openings in the arm and he is so 

00:05:39.099 --> 00:05:44.469
 I let loose so much fun and I put 

00:05:41.739 --> 00:05:47.139
 with an organic egg boot also since 

00:05:44.469 --> 00:05:49.649
 This one has a leap to another she was without 

00:05:47.139 --> 00:05:49.649
 jump 

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:58.780
 this look I made one of the most chic 

00:05:55.120 --> 00:06:01.900
 for a more romantic dinner a chip 

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:04.360
 I put a pair of jeans this is a 

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:06.069
 little jump that very disease that causes 

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:09.129
 of a large central 

00:06:06.069 --> 00:06:12.240
 this case here is beautiful and a purse a 

00:06:09.129 --> 00:06:12.240
 skin night 

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:18.340
 so this is it folks wait very small 

00:06:16.449 --> 00:06:20.340
 to decide if you liked it 

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:22.750
 I signed up under my channel. 

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:25.900
 block will veto those products that I 

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:28.539
 I used it and will have it later there and the 

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:30.190
 girls the makeup is according to me 

00:06:28.539 --> 00:06:32.229
 I like it, I think it 's a boyfriend. 

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:35.860
 super romantic then taxis rose 

00:06:32.229 --> 00:06:37.539
 my law but on this date it according to 

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:40.000
 Your personal taste if you will use it on 

00:06:37.539 --> 00:06:41.620
 day you put less shine on the 

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.289
 more opaque if you are going to use it at night 

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:45.909
 because it puts more glitter but it can 

00:06:44.289 --> 00:06:48.490
 same basis as people who have 

00:06:45.909 --> 00:06:50.110
 sure you're going to rock and also 

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:55.139
 can put the color of the lipstick that you 

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:55.139
 like it or kiss you tea
