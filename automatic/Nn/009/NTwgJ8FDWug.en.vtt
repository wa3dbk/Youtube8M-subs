 he presents with the leon cupra 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.389
 new sporty top model 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:11.639

 engine in two power levels 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:21.510
 Available with 195 and 206 kw is the 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.670
 Cooper is a 3 in a concept he is 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.050
 lively in the city is racy on the 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.609
 race track and casual on the 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.310
 highway and the whole goes through 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.810
 pressing the button in the 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.590
 you can change the dashboard 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:36.300
 between comfortable sporty dynamic 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.040
 then the sound changes and when 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.450
 downshift gives the car 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.040
 independently really great 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.210
 Intergas is working on it 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.200
 and there is one more 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.480
 individual settings options 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.629
 then you can use the vehicle according to the 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.760
 individual taste 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:52.770
 configure 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:55.530
 the leon cupra is the most powerful 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.719
 seat series automobile and you can see that 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.160
 also as a five-door and we know in the 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.980
 fast spanier already from earlier 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.850
 he is new as leon sc cooper sport 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.850
 coupe with three doors 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:12.710
 a three-dimensional honeycomb pattern directs 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:15.550
 the views of the grille and 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:15.550
 air intakes 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:25.890
 eye-catching at the rear are spoiler diffuser 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:25.890
 and two oval exhaust pipes 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:31.110
 the power station is the new 2 liter 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:31.110
 engine 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:44.409
 we drive the fast three-door with 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:47.290
 206 kw and double clutch transmission dsg 

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:50.070
 in 5 7 seconds it accelerates from 0 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:53.520
 on 100 km h and only at tempo 250 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.520
 ends the propulsion 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:10.670
 the new seat leon cupra is the 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:12.710
 Strongest cooper ever with 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:14.600
 up to 280 ps but of course I want 

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:17.470
 look what that vehicle on the 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:17.470
 race track knew 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:29.360
 the leon cupra just barely does it 

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:31.070
 1300 75 kilograms and so he counts 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.320
 the lightest compact athlete in 

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:34.790
 shows his class on the race track 

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:37.010
 Its all the dynamics that 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:39.560
 Interplay of light weight and 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:42.290
 the rigid body structure the 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:44.090
 adaptive landing gear dcc is 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:45.890
 specially optimized for the cupra and 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:48.170
 fits the characteristic of the vehicle 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:50.030
 within milliseconds to the current 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:50.830
 conditions or to the wishes of the 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:53.360
 driver 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:55.459
 also standard is the progressive 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:58.840
 Steer the precise to small 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:58.840
 steering movements responded 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:03.359
 cobra comes from kap racing and a racer 

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:05.219
 is the cooper that proves on the 

00:03:03.359 --> 00:03:07.650
 race track the engine has every time 

00:03:05.219 --> 00:03:09.989
 enough power to grab the brakes 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:13.049
 Snappy to the steering is very very 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:16.079
 Precise and the chassis can handle any amount 

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:17.909
 from to help, for example, the 

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:20.069
 differential lock on the day before 

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:22.200
 that sounds complicated but it is 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:23.939
 not the car distributed by itself anymore 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.040
 force on the wheel at the front axle 

00:03:23.939 --> 00:03:27.659
 that has more liability and therefore can 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.549
 get out of the curve even faster out 

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:31.709
 drive with the very precise steering 

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:35.849
 makes that a lot of fun and the engine 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:37.379
 does his part also to the 

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:39.569
 Double clutch transmission is in the 

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:41.639
 lower gears translated and can be short 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:43.530
 also via optional rocker switches on the 

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:45.510
 be served steering wheel who would rather own 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:48.530
 Switch gets the cupra too 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:50.669
 manual six-speed gearbox 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:51.239
 my conclusion for the cupra on the 

00:03:50.669 --> 00:03:54.419
 Racetrack 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:56.159
 the Spaniard goes like hell especially 

00:03:54.419 --> 00:03:58.109
 in coop mode that is for the 

00:03:56.159 --> 00:04:00.329
 the race track has been designed 

00:03:58.109 --> 00:04:00.959
 accelerator pedal reacts more sensitive to the chassis 

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:03.959
 is taut 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:05.849
 The steering is also more precise and 

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:07.229
 You can feel that in every curve at the 

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:10.439
 Maneuver that you on the race track 

00:04:07.229 --> 00:04:12.449
 lies down the new cooper is both for 

00:04:10.439 --> 00:04:14.370
 The city for the highway as well 

00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:17.030
 great for the race track 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:17.030
 sportgerät 

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:23.370
 even in the interior convinced the 

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:25.370
 sporty trim the self-confident though 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:27.690
 that does not seem exaggerated 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:30.560
 perforated leather sports steering wheel lies 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:30.560
 pleasant in the hand 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:49.480
 High-contrast lines flow around the 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:53.820
 contour of the sports seats and at the 

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:53.820
 flash fittings facing made of chromium 

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:09.790
 in everyday life cupra shone with foldable 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:12.240
 backrests and at least 380 liters 

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:12.240
 trunk 

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:20.699
 For the city, the leon cupra is almost 

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:22.439
 a bit overpowered on the 

00:05:20.699 --> 00:05:24.179
 Race track is not every day 

00:05:22.439 --> 00:05:26.759
 That's why the Bergische Landstraße 

00:05:24.179 --> 00:05:30.709
 exactly the right field of application for the 

00:05:26.759 --> 00:05:30.709
 There he was the most cheerful cooper
