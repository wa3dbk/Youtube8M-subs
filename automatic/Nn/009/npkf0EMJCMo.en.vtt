00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:35.800
 hello to all guys and welcome to 

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:38.020
 this new explanation 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:39.699
 I want to teach the wave controller 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:41.590
 what is the wave control you saw 

00:00:39.699 --> 00:00:44.100
 first the technique that allows him to 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:46.600
 take any card from the deck e 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.970
 put it in the bottom of the deck without it 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.620
 viewer then notices it for 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:53.530
 First we have to get a card 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:56.379
 any of the deck for example the ace of 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:58.239
 flowers and place it approximately at 

00:00:56.379 --> 00:00:59.909
 gay march center 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:02.530
 at this point we have to push it inside 

00:00:59.909 --> 00:01:05.920
 a little bit raised which is therefore in 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:07.630
 this way with the index ok so 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:10.450
 because it is a little bit raised because 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:11.950
 see that this separation will be created 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:14.619
 continuing to push it will end 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:17.080
 in the upper bunch 

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:19.090
 ok this is what will happen to this 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.720
 point you have to take with the thumb of the 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:23.619
 right hand 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:25.630
 all the ok bunch this is with me 

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:28.750
 you'll have to do it all over again 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:30.850
 we have the ace of flowers 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:35.830
 we insert left flowers we push 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:38.950
 inside and we take everything ok perfect a 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:41.730
 this point what we have to do with the 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:44.950
 middle and thumb we have to think 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:49.480
 the other bunch now has this 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:51.480
 thought more about your right as possible 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:54.430
 and at this point with the left hand 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:56.500
 let's think between the index and thumb the first 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:58.330
 bunch and then we continue then 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.710
 we raise a portion of bunch with 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:04.000
 the index 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:05.409
 and we continue to do it ok up to 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.869
 when you want, in short, until you do 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:10.179
 they finish the cards but because so much below 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:12.310
 our card will remain so we do 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:17.020
 all over again we have ace of flowers 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:19.810
 ok let's take everything 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:22.569
 put the second one under the bunch 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:28.180
 we think of it as medium and thumb 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:31.170
 1 and then continue 12 fast visas 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:31.170
 it would be so 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:43.269
 in this way we have ours 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:45.580
 card in this video or used too 

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:46.989
 the spin that is what you have if you want 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:49.150
 the explanation of the spino you can 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:53.849
 find it on my channel or otherwise 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:56.200
 clicking here ok perfect 

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:58.470
 no guys i hope i was 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.470
 help
