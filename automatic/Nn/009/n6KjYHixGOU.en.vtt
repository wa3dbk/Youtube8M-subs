is they're his of speed but he got
tanked<00:01:17.280> out<00:01:17.400> by<00:01:17.610> Rotom<00:01:17.939> wash<00:01:18.060> and<00:01:18.830> here<00:01:19.830> i<00:01:19.920> have

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
tanked out by Rotom wash and here i have

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.980 
tanked out by Rotom wash and here i have
this<00:01:20.549> greninja<00:01:20.880> it's<00:01:21.180> kind<00:01:21.360> of<00:01:21.390> useless<00:01:21.630> it's

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
this greninja it's kind of useless it's

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.690 
this greninja it's kind of useless it's
just<00:01:22.229> there<00:01:22.500> i<00:01:22.710> guess<00:01:22.950> to<00:01:23.070> take<00:01:23.220> those<00:01:23.369> space

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
just there i guess to take those space

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.060 
just there i guess to take those space
but<00:01:24.030> it's<00:01:24.360> protein<00:01:24.720> and<00:01:25.020> i<00:01:25.650> went<00:01:25.799> for<00:01:25.950> the

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
but it's protein and i went for the

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.859 
but it's protein and i went for the
shadow<00:01:26.310> sneak<00:01:26.610> just<00:01:27.060> to<00:01:27.150> change<00:01:27.390> my<00:01:27.570> type<00:01:27.720> to

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
shadow sneak just to change my type to

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.560 
shadow sneak just to change my type to
ghost<00:01:28.080> and<00:01:28.229> get<00:01:28.409> the<00:01:28.500> priority<00:01:28.920> move<00:01:29.070> because

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:29.570 
ghost and get the priority move because

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:33.560 
ghost and get the priority move because
yeah<00:01:31.490> and<00:01:32.490> what<00:01:32.700> protein<00:01:33.030> does<00:01:33.180> if<00:01:33.360> you<00:01:33.390> guys

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
yeah and what protein does if you guys

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:34.999 
yeah and what protein does if you guys
don't<00:01:33.720> know<00:01:33.900> it's<00:01:34.110> the<00:01:34.290> dream<00:01:34.439> world<00:01:34.619> ability

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009
