but<00:03:46.850> I<00:03:46.910> wanted<00:03:47.150> to<00:03:47.269> know<00:03:47.420> if<00:03:47.570> anybody<00:03:47.900> out

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:48.140 
but I wanted to know if anybody out

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:50.560 
but I wanted to know if anybody out
there<00:03:48.350> collected<00:03:49.040> Errol<00:03:49.459> and<00:03:49.700> what<00:03:50.420> they

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:50.570 
there collected Errol and what they

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:53.259 
there collected Errol and what they
thought<00:03:50.840> of<00:03:51.049> it<00:03:51.230> and<00:03:51.850> it's<00:03:52.850> definitely

00:03:53.259 --> 00:03:53.269 
thought of it and it's definitely

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:54.789 
thought of it and it's definitely
something<00:03:53.450> I'd<00:03:53.660> be<00:03:53.780> interested<00:03:53.989> in<00:03:54.320> doing<00:03:54.440> but

00:03:54.789 --> 00:03:54.799 
something I'd be interested in doing but

00:03:54.799 --> 00:03:56.979 
something I'd be interested in doing but
right<00:03:55.730> now<00:03:55.910> I'm<00:03:56.060> kind<00:03:56.329> of<00:03:56.390> focused<00:03:56.780> on<00:03:56.930> the

00:03:56.979 --> 00:03:56.989 
right now I'm kind of focused on the

00:03:56.989 --> 00:04:00.220 
right now I'm kind of focused on the
wooden<00:03:57.380> railway<00:03:57.709> line<00:03:57.950> but<00:03:58.959> it's<00:03:59.959> definitely

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:00.230 
wooden railway line but it's definitely

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:02.620 
wooden railway line but it's definitely
interesting<00:04:00.890> it<00:04:01.670> looks<00:04:01.850> like<00:04:02.030> a<00:04:02.060> lot<00:04:02.329> of<00:04:02.359> the

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:02.630 
interesting it looks like a lot of the

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:04.960 
interesting it looks like a lot of the
stuff<00:04:02.900> is<00:04:03.049> easier<00:04:03.470> to<00:04:03.560> come<00:04:03.739> by<00:04:03.890> and<00:04:04.130> if<00:04:04.790> you

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:04.970 
stuff is easier to come by and if you

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:06.550 
stuff is easier to come by and if you
have<00:04:05.090> a<00:04:05.150> budget<00:04:05.510> it<00:04:05.660> seems<00:04:05.900> to<00:04:06.109> me<00:04:06.230> that<00:04:06.260> you'd

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:06.560 
have a budget it seems to me that you'd

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:10.390 
have a budget it seems to me that you'd
be<00:04:06.709> able<00:04:06.799> to<00:04:07.209> collect<00:04:08.209> most<00:04:08.540> items<00:04:09.079> for<00:04:09.560> you

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:10.400 
be able to collect most items for you

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:13.420 
be able to collect most items for you
know<00:04:10.519> a<00:04:10.549> cheaper<00:04:11.090> price<00:04:11.329> as<00:04:11.690> far<00:04:11.900> as<00:04:12.400> but<00:04:13.400> I

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:13.430 
know a cheaper price as far as but I

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:14.890 
know a cheaper price as far as but I
think<00:04:13.700> there<00:04:13.880> is<00:04:13.970> a<00:04:14.000> lot<00:04:14.269> more<00:04:14.480> in<00:04:14.630> the<00:04:14.720> line<00:04:14.870> so

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:14.900 
think there is a lot more in the line so

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:17.920 
think there is a lot more in the line so
I'm<00:04:15.440> not<00:04:15.620> sure<00:04:15.850> anyways<00:04:16.850> make<00:04:17.479> leave<00:04:17.900> a
