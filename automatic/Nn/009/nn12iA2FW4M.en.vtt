00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.179
 prosthetics for many years 

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:05.130
 used in dentistry and is 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:07.020
 one of the most popular methods 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:07.649
 aimed at restoring dental 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.840
 row 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:15.089
 what types of prosthetics exist 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:16.920
 tell our expert there are two 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.250
 types of removable dentures 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:22.410
 these are full dentures and partial 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:25.609
 dentures which include themselves so 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:28.859
 called acrylic or plastic 

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:29.880
 thermoplastics you and either flexible and byugelnye 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.560
 dentures 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.680
 full dentures are made 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:37.680
 in the absence of teeth on one or 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.640
 both jaws their task to fill 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.530
 lack of teeth 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.989
 color and shape of teeth on removable dental 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.579
 dentures are chosen by patients during 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.230
 dental visits 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.329
 dentures made by 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.760
 modern technology and have high 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.590
 aesthetic properties and wear resistance 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.629
 modern products in conditions 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.789
 proper operation and correct 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:59.340
 manufacturing technology for a long time 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:01.350
 retain their appearance strength and 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.030
 density partial dentures 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.280
 manufactured in the absence of 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.470
 one or more teeth 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.080
 partial plastic dentures 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.869
 used to compensate for defects 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.119
 the dentition and are the easiest 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.759
 we make them and available at the price 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:20.340
 they are fixed by the so-called 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:22.770
 clasps of metal hooks which 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.840
 hold on to the extreme support of the defect 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.220
 Klammerâ€™s teeth are made of 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.770
 stainless steel and 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.689
 or noble alloys which have 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.729
 high spring properties 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.380
 thanks to such properties clasp 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.200
 securely fixes the prosthesis 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.880
 during meal talk and so 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.360
 Further 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.350
 byugel prosthesis one of the most 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:45.079
 modern comfortable and reliable 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.740
 designs among removable partial 

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:47.930
 prostheses 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.810
 great difference in diesel prostheses 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:52.070
 is that chewing load 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:55.399
 evenly distributed between 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:57.470
 jawbone and abutment teeth in 

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:59.750
 difference from partial platelets 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:02.030
 removable dentures where the load falls in 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:04.189
 mainly on the gum legal prosthesis can 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:06.229
 also hooked 

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:08.060
 clasps but there are more 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:10.160
 modern way of fixing with 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:12.860
 the use of so-called and then what 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:15.170
 give away min or castle consists of two 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.900
 parts one of which is mounted 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:19.489
 cable prosthesis and the second hidden in 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.440
 artificial crown which 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:22.130
 made on your own 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.630
 abutment tooth 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:25.700
 this option compared to 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:27.890
 traditional klammer has more 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.930
 significant advantage due to high 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:32.209
 aesthetics and reliability of the prosthesis from 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:34.700
 thermoplastic so-called flexible on 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:36.890
 ilona you and or prostheses strengthened 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:39.769
 have several advantages over ordinary 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:41.690
 plastic night acrylic prosthesis among 

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:44.090
 they can be distinguished by increased flexibility 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:46.250
 increased strength allowing 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:48.579
 to withstand higher loads 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:51.200
 accurate fit and secure fit 

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:52.459
 no need to grind 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.620
 teeth under the crown 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:57.019
 no allergic reactions 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:59.900
 no metal parts in 

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:03.079
 oral cavities visible when smiling fast 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:06.019
 addictive and lightweight prosthesis apply 

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:07.940
 such prostheses as in the absence of 1 and 

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:10.880
 several and even complete absence 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:13.280
 teeth therefore flexible real denture 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:15.650
 alternative to many dentures and in 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:18.049
 first of all his outdated brethren 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:19.760
 acrylic dentures should 

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:21.560
 note that all kinds of removable 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:23.930
 prosthetics imply 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:26.510
 the need to adapt to them time 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:28.970
 addiction to the prosthesis depends on its type 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:31.420
 material of individual characteristics 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:33.709
 patient's body 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:35.930
 Today prosthetics is great 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:37.569
 variety of methods and techniques that 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:39.950
 differ in price policy 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:41.840
 aesthetic and medical indications 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:43.400
 such a variety of options gives 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:46.069
 modern man is huge 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:48.110
 advantage of choice and your task 

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:50.299
 make it right we hope that 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:52.840
 thanks to our experts, it will be you 

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:52.840
 not difficult
