 that's george him today we bring the 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:42.030
 we go to the technology we do 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.370
 Use is called stop motion the first 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.680
 part of the video I show you as you 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.170
 record the whole and in the second part 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.870
 of the video I'll show you then how that 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.850
 whole then the computer goes on 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.699
 we attach double-sided adhesive tape 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.980
 At his feet he stops a little more 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.920
 and the whole thing gets a bit easier 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:04.830
 then you take your camera makes 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.960
 picture of george and then you go with it 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.570
 george a bit further and makes again 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.939
 a picture and the exposure you should 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.159
 manually adjust so iso manually 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.450
 to adjust 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:17.250
 Aperture and exposure time manually 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.500
 otherwise your picture flickers 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.439
 something, and this looks not so good 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:25.229
 So go manual mode then do it 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:28.439
 you need your pictures for a second 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:32.130
 her about 15 pictures with that 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:34.619
 movement is fluid and if you then 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:39.470
 so have a few pictures together 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:39.470
 you continue with the editing htc 

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:54.770
 if he has pc then that should be 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.869
 download free program 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:59.359
 the link to it constantly in the 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:02.420
 description the program opens her 

00:01:59.359 --> 00:02:05.030
 then you go on your video file 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.750
 and then every first picture opens euro 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.849
 series 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:09.709
 if you have done more about series 

00:02:07.849 --> 00:02:12.410
 then you have the pictures in 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:13.849
 move a folder together as 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:14.540

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:16.580
 folder 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:19.220
 then you open the folder then that 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:21.500

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:26.360
 teams then gives a rider point 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:31.790
 Preference is then there someday 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:32.989

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:35.209
 1 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:37.459
 that means as much as that then applies 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:38.510
 video with 15 pictures per second 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:42.670
 changed 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:45.739
 and then he goes to vl and save.tv 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:46.579
 then choose a location from memory 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:48.739
 the whole 

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:50.269
 and then she comes the stored 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:51.020
 video still in your editing program 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:54.050

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:56.810
 adjust the aspect ratio with 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:58.940
 cut several scenes together and 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:02.150
 still the color and something else set 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:05.600
