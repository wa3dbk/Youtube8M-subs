welcome<00:00:00.780> to<00:00:00.930> digital<00:00:01.050> tool<00:00:01.439> box<00:00:01.650> so<00:00:01.860> there

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:02.010 
welcome to digital tool box so there

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:03.860 
welcome to digital tool box so there
we're<00:00:02.220> going<00:00:02.460> to<00:00:02.580> create<00:00:02.820> another<00:00:03.210> attractor

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:03.870 
we're going to create another attractor

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:05.809 
we're going to create another attractor
but<00:00:04.110> this<00:00:04.230> time<00:00:04.470> we're<00:00:04.710> going<00:00:04.799> to<00:00:04.859> create<00:00:05.700> the

00:00:05.809 --> 00:00:05.819 
but this time we're going to create the

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:09.230 
but this time we're going to create the
attractors<00:00:06.270> on<00:00:06.480> a<00:00:06.509> surface<00:00:06.839> not<00:00:07.710> on<00:00:07.919> a<00:00:07.950> to<00:00:08.130> a<00:00:08.790> 2d

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
attractors on a surface not on a to a 2d

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.640 
attractors on a surface not on a to a 2d
plane<00:00:09.269> and<00:00:10.219> on<00:00:11.219> a<00:00:11.670> surface<00:00:12.000> you<00:00:12.599> give<00:00:12.780> a<00:00:12.809> 3d

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
plane and on a surface you give a 3d

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.530 
plane and on a surface you give a 3d
attractions<00:00:14.219> such<00:00:14.460> as<00:00:14.490> if<00:00:14.759> I<00:00:14.849> move<00:00:15.059> this<00:00:15.089> point

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
attractions such as if I move this point

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.380 
attractions such as if I move this point
further<00:00:16.109> down<00:00:16.410> near<00:00:16.680> the<00:00:16.770> surface<00:00:17.210> you<00:00:18.210> get<00:00:18.359> a

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
further down near the surface you get a

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.179 
further down near the surface you get a
different<00:00:18.630> attraction<00:00:19.470> and<00:00:19.619> I<00:00:19.949> can<00:00:20.100> also

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
different attraction and I can also

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.370 
different attraction and I can also
apply<00:00:20.550> this<00:00:20.640> to<00:00:20.939> a<00:00:20.970> curve<00:00:21.330> so<00:00:21.660> if<00:00:21.810> I<00:00:21.869> reconnect

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
apply this to a curve so if I reconnect

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.800 
apply this to a curve so if I reconnect
this<00:00:22.529> to<00:00:22.740> the<00:00:22.830> distance<00:00:23.279> here<00:00:23.519> now<00:00:24.449> if<00:00:24.570> i<00:00:24.660> move

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
this to the distance here now if i move

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.650 
this to the distance here now if i move
the<00:00:25.019> curve<00:00:25.230> around<00:00:25.550> the<00:00:26.550> the<00:00:27.150> circles<00:00:27.539> are

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
the curve around the the circles are

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.140 
the curve around the the circles are
changing<00:00:28.260> based<00:00:29.010> on<00:00:29.250> the<00:00:29.369> position<00:00:29.609> of<00:00:29.939> the

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
changing based on the position of the

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.770 
changing based on the position of the
curve<00:00:30.630> itself<00:00:31.170> so<00:00:31.590> if<00:00:31.679> i<00:00:31.769> move<00:00:31.920> the<00:00:32.040> curve<00:00:32.250> more

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:32.780 
curve itself so if i move the curve more

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:35.990 
curve itself so if i move the curve more
more<00:00:33.780> close<00:00:34.140> to<00:00:34.170> the<00:00:34.440> surface<00:00:34.620> or<00:00:35.100> it<00:00:35.730> will<00:00:35.850> be

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
more close to the surface or it will be

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.389 
more close to the surface or it will be
affected<00:00:36.450> so<00:00:37.320> to<00:00:37.410> create<00:00:37.620> this<00:00:37.890> i'm<00:00:38.129> going<00:00:38.340> to

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
affected so to create this i'm going to

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.930 
affected so to create this i'm going to
use<00:00:38.719> some<00:00:39.719> of<00:00:39.840> the<00:00:39.899> old<00:00:40.190> definitions<00:00:41.190> so<00:00:41.850> the

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
use some of the old definitions so the

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.580 
use some of the old definitions so the
first<00:00:42.180> definition<00:00:42.989> i'm<00:00:43.110> going<00:00:43.230> to<00:00:43.320> pull<00:00:43.469> out

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
first definition i'm going to pull out

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.770 
first definition i'm going to pull out
is<00:00:43.770> the<00:00:44.100> exploding<00:00:44.670> divide<00:00:45.000> tutorial

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
is the exploding divide tutorial

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.959 
is the exploding divide tutorial
definition<00:00:46.289> and<00:00:46.469> here<00:00:47.190> i'm<00:00:47.309> going<00:00:47.520> to<00:00:47.579> set<00:00:47.789> the

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
definition and here i'm going to set the

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.479 
definition and here i'm going to set the
surface<00:00:48.420> so<00:00:49.110> make<00:00:49.289> sure<00:00:49.320> you<00:00:49.649> guys<00:00:49.800> clear<00:00:50.370> the

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
surface so make sure you guys clear the

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.729 
surface so make sure you guys clear the
surface<00:00:50.879> clear<00:00:51.600> values<00:00:51.989> first<00:00:52.230> before<00:00:52.680> you

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
surface clear values first before you

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.889 
surface clear values first before you
guys<00:00:52.800> site<00:00:53.100> it<00:00:53.219> i'm<00:00:54.030> going<00:00:54.390> to<00:00:54.449> set<00:00:54.690> one

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
guys site it i'm going to set one

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.130 
guys site it i'm going to set one
surface<00:00:55.460> so<00:00:56.460> now<00:00:56.579> we<00:00:56.640> have<00:00:56.730> our<00:00:56.879> exploded<00:00:57.510> fits

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
surface so now we have our exploded fits

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.569 
surface so now we have our exploded fits
into<00:00:58.350> panels<00:00:58.739> and<00:00:58.949> we're<00:00:59.070> not<00:00:59.219> going<00:00:59.399> to<00:00:59.460> need

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
into panels and we're not going to need

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.330 
into panels and we're not going to need
the<00:00:59.789> divide<00:01:00.629> points<00:01:01.440> we<00:01:01.530> just<00:01:01.710> need<00:01:01.829> to<00:01:01.920> divide

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
the divide points we just need to divide

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.000 
the divide points we just need to divide
I<00:01:03.090> mean<00:01:03.570> to<00:01:03.629> explode<00:01:03.989> surface<00:01:04.439> and<00:01:04.619> from<00:01:04.920> the

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
I mean to explode surface and from the

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.010 
I mean to explode surface and from the
subsurface<00:01:05.400> and<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:06.420> next<00:01:06.630> thing<00:01:06.750> we<00:01:06.869> need<00:01:06.990> to

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
subsurface and the next thing we need to

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.050 
subsurface and the next thing we need to
do<00:01:07.110> is<00:01:07.229> find<00:01:07.439> the<00:01:07.710> normal<00:01:07.979> to<00:01:08.280> each<00:01:08.369> surface<00:01:08.640> so

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
do is find the normal to each surface so

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.539 
do is find the normal to each surface so
our<00:01:09.330> circles<00:01:09.840> are<00:01:09.960> laid<00:01:10.110> out<00:01:10.140> correctly<00:01:10.549> so

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
our circles are laid out correctly so

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.250 
our circles are laid out correctly so
I'm<00:01:11.670> going<00:01:11.820> to<00:01:11.880> go<00:01:11.970> into<00:01:12.150> the<00:01:12.630> evaluate

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
I'm going to go into the evaluate

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.440 
I'm going to go into the evaluate
surface<00:01:13.680> tutorial<00:01:14.070> definition<00:01:14.640> and<00:01:14.850> i'm

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
surface tutorial definition and i'm

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.440 
surface tutorial definition and i'm
going<00:01:15.659> to<00:01:15.750> copy<00:01:16.110> and<00:01:16.380> copy<00:01:17.100> these<00:01:17.549> slot<00:01:18.000> maybe

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
going to copy and copy these slot maybe

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:24.320 
going to copy and copy these slot maybe
sliders<00:01:18.840> and<00:01:19.049> buttons<00:01:22.490> you<00:01:23.490> only<00:01:23.640> need<00:01:23.820> these

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
sliders and buttons you only need these

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.050 
sliders and buttons you only need these
three<00:01:24.659> so<00:01:24.810> I'm<00:01:24.900> a<00:01:24.990> copy<00:01:25.229> and<00:01:25.860> then<00:01:26.729> we<00:01:26.880> go<00:01:27.030> to

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
three so I'm a copy and then we go to

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.670 
three so I'm a copy and then we go to
the<00:01:27.390> exploding<00:01:27.780> divide<00:01:28.049> i'm<00:01:28.229> going<00:01:28.380> to<00:01:28.439> paste

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
the exploding divide i'm going to paste

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.569 
the exploding divide i'm going to paste
this<00:01:29.030> and<00:01:30.320> then<00:01:31.320> I<00:01:31.350> grab<00:01:31.619> go<00:01:31.950> geometry<00:01:32.520> and

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
this and then I grab go geometry and

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.819 
this and then I grab go geometry and
grabbed<00:01:32.850> surface<00:01:33.540> from<00:01:33.960> and<00:01:34.229> then<00:01:34.619> I'm<00:01:34.710> going

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
grabbed surface from and then I'm going

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.219 
grabbed surface from and then I'm going
to<00:01:34.890> apply<00:01:35.369> faces<00:01:35.850> of<00:01:35.970> this<00:01:36.090> and<00:01:36.960> I'm<00:01:37.020> going<00:01:37.170> to

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
to apply faces of this and I'm going to

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.200 
to apply faces of this and I'm going to
unproven<00:01:38.040> xplode<00:01:38.520> because<00:01:38.790> I<00:01:38.850> don't<00:01:39.000> want<00:01:39.119> to

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
unproven xplode because I don't want to

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.719 
unproven xplode because I don't want to
see<00:01:39.329> the<00:01:39.570> vertices<00:01:40.110> and<00:01:40.500> these<00:01:41.460> are<00:01:41.640> the

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
see the vertices and these are the

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.139 
see the vertices and these are the
surface<00:01:42.090> that<00:01:42.240> we<00:01:42.450> want<00:01:42.689> to<00:01:42.869> evaluate<00:01:43.350> and

00:01:44.139 --> 00:01:44.149 
surface that we want to evaluate and

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:48.530 
surface that we want to evaluate and
then<00:01:45.149> I'm<00:01:45.270> going<00:01:45.509> to<00:01:45.810> the<00:01:46.790> the<00:01:47.790> old<00:01:48.060> definition

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
then I'm going to the the old definition

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.899 
then I'm going to the the old definition
on<00:01:48.600> the<00:01:48.689> tractors<00:01:49.140> of<00:01:49.290> two<00:01:49.470> curves<00:01:49.799> and<00:01:50.159> that's

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
on the tractors of two curves and that's

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
I'm just going to copy these buttons

inition<00:02:17.400> I<00:02:20.270> just<00:02:21.270> zoom<00:02:22.050> out<00:02:22.200> here<00:02:22.440> a<00:02:22.470> little

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
inition I just zoom out here a little

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:30.210 
inition I just zoom out here a little
real<00:02:23.280> quick

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.180 

so<00:02:30.820> now<00:02:30.940> we<00:02:31.000> need<00:02:31.210> to<00:02:31.680> set<00:02:32.680> our<00:02:32.710> curve<00:02:33.010> so<00:02:33.130> I'm

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
so now we need to set our curve so I'm

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:35.850 
so now we need to set our curve so I'm
just<00:02:33.370> going<00:02:33.490> to<00:02:33.550> grab<00:02:33.670> a<00:02:33.970> curve<00:02:34.470> curve<00:02:35.470> button

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
just going to grab a curve curve button

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:38.580 
just going to grab a curve curve button
and<00:02:36.100> I<00:02:36.160> apply<00:02:36.370> this<00:02:36.430> to<00:02:36.700> curves<00:02:37.350> and<00:02:38.350> I'm<00:02:38.440> also

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
and I apply this to curves and I'm also

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:40.770 
and I apply this to curves and I'm also
going<00:02:38.770> to<00:02:38.830> grab<00:02:39.040> a<00:02:39.070> point<00:02:39.540> so<00:02:40.540> I'm<00:02:40.600> going<00:02:40.630> to

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
going to grab a point so I'm going to

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.530 
going to grab a point so I'm going to
set<00:02:40.930> this<00:02:41.080> point<00:02:41.470> right<00:02:41.830> now<00:02:41.890> and<00:02:42.490> I'm<00:02:43.390> also

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
set this point right now and I'm also

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:49.200 
set this point right now and I'm also
going<00:02:43.750> to<00:02:43.810> set<00:02:44.080> the<00:02:44.200> curve<00:02:47.340> so<00:02:48.340> if<00:02:48.760> you<00:02:48.910> want<00:02:49.090> to

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:49.210 
going to set the curve so if you want to

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:50.940 
going to set the curve so if you want to
figure<00:02:49.600> out<00:02:49.750> the<00:02:49.810> distance<00:02:50.080> we<00:02:50.590> can<00:02:50.740> just

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
figure out the distance we can just

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:53.130 
figure out the distance we can just
apply<00:02:51.190> a<00:02:51.520> into<00:02:52.060> the<00:02:52.360> points<00:02:52.690> that<00:02:52.780> we<00:02:52.900> want<00:02:53.050> to

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 
apply a into the points that we want to

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:54.900 
apply a into the points that we want to
evaluate<00:02:53.320> which<00:02:53.860> is<00:02:54.010> from<00:02:54.310> the<00:02:54.460> evaluate

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:54.910 
evaluate which is from the evaluate

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:58.170 
evaluate which is from the evaluate
surface<00:02:55.300> and<00:02:55.740> then<00:02:56.740> be<00:02:57.010> will<00:02:57.310> be<00:02:57.490> in<00:02:57.850> to<00:02:58.060> the

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
surface and then be will be in to the

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:01.680 
surface and then be will be in to the
point<00:02:58.450> and<00:02:58.860> then<00:02:59.860> are<00:03:00.100> we<00:03:00.280> going<00:03:00.580> to<00:03:00.820> the

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690 
point and then are we going to the

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:04.890 
point and then are we going to the
circle<00:03:02.170> and<00:03:02.459> then<00:03:03.459> the<00:03:03.640> circle<00:03:04.090> the<00:03:04.450> origin<00:03:04.840> of

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:04.900 
circle and then the circle the origin of

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:07.260 
circle and then the circle the origin of
the<00:03:05.020> circle<00:03:05.350> will<00:03:05.440> be<00:03:05.590> at<00:03:05.680> the<00:03:05.800> P<00:03:06.040> and<00:03:06.280> now<00:03:07.209> we

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:07.270 
the circle will be at the P and now we

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:09.270 
the circle will be at the P and now we
want<00:03:07.570> to<00:03:07.600> orientate<00:03:08.200> each<00:03:08.440> circle<00:03:08.920> to<00:03:09.130> the

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280 
want to orientate each circle to the

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.010 
want to orientate each circle to the
surface<00:03:09.490> plane<00:03:09.910> so<00:03:10.150> then<00:03:10.390> the<00:03:10.660> evaluate

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:11.020 
surface plane so then the evaluate

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:12.540 
surface plane so then the evaluate
surface<00:03:11.290> gives<00:03:11.500> us<00:03:11.590> the<00:03:11.740> normal<00:03:12.040> vector<00:03:12.340> and

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:12.550 
surface gives us the normal vector and

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:15.330 
surface gives us the normal vector and
that<00:03:12.580> will<00:03:13.300> go<00:03:13.420> into<00:03:13.540> n<00:03:13.780> and<00:03:14.110> now<00:03:14.620> each<00:03:14.830> circle

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.340 
that will go into n and now each circle

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:19.560 
that will go into n and now each circle
is<00:03:16.110> normal<00:03:17.110> to<00:03:17.200> that<00:03:17.290> surface<00:03:17.790> so<00:03:18.790> if<00:03:18.910> i<00:03:19.030> go

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:19.570 
is normal to that surface so if i go

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:23.990 
is normal to that surface so if i go
into<00:03:20.410> perspective<00:03:20.709> here<00:03:21.510> you<00:03:22.510> can<00:03:23.200> see<00:03:23.380> that

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
into perspective here you can see that

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.730 
into perspective here you can see that
so<00:03:25.000> if<00:03:25.090> we<00:03:25.180> want<00:03:25.330> to<00:03:25.450> apply<00:03:25.690> to<00:03:25.750> a<00:03:25.959> curve<00:03:26.470> all

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:26.740 
so if we want to apply to a curve all

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:29.460 
so if we want to apply to a curve all
you<00:03:27.010> gotta<00:03:27.160> do<00:03:27.310> is<00:03:27.340> reconnect<00:03:28.030> p<00:03:28.390> into<00:03:28.690> B<00:03:29.230> and

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.470 
you gotta do is reconnect p into B and

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:35.640 
you gotta do is reconnect p into B and
not<00:03:29.620> the<00:03:29.800> point<00:03:32.220> and<00:03:33.840> i<00:03:34.840> also<00:03:34.989> have<00:03:35.230> to<00:03:35.350> apply

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 
not the point and i also have to apply

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:39.120 
not the point and i also have to apply
this<00:03:36.160> p<00:03:36.519> into<00:03:37.300> the<00:03:37.810> points<00:03:38.290> so<00:03:38.590> now<00:03:38.739> it's

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:39.130 
this p into the points so now it's

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:43.110 
this p into the points so now it's
applied<00:03:40.170> so<00:03:41.170> now<00:03:41.320> now<00:03:42.040> it's<00:03:42.250> a<00:03:42.430> the<00:03:42.670> attractors

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
applied so now now it's a the attractors

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.270 
applied so now now it's a the attractors
are<00:03:43.269> working<00:03:43.630> with<00:03:44.290> the<00:03:44.500> curve<00:03:44.800> and<00:03:44.980> not<00:03:45.130> the

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:45.280 
are working with the curve and not the

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.759 
are working with the curve and not the
point<00:03:45.519> and<00:03:45.820> if<00:03:46.630> i<00:03:46.750> want<00:03:46.959> to<00:03:47.050> reconnect<00:03:47.470> at<00:03:47.650> the

00:03:47.759 --> 00:03:47.769 
point and if i want to reconnect at the

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:50.190 
point and if i want to reconnect at the
point<00:03:48.040> just<00:03:48.910> get<00:03:49.269> stuff<00:03:49.630> to<00:03:49.750> switch<00:03:49.930> it<00:03:50.080> out

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:50.200 
point just get stuff to switch it out

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:52.320 
point just get stuff to switch it out
and<00:03:50.440> that's<00:03:51.370> how<00:03:51.459> you<00:03:51.519> create<00:03:51.730> an<00:03:51.940> attractor

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:52.330 
and that's how you create an attractor

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:56.489 
and that's how you create an attractor
on<00:03:52.480> a<00:03:52.510> surface<00:03:52.840> and<00:03:53.260> thanks<00:03:54.100> for<00:03:54.190> watching
