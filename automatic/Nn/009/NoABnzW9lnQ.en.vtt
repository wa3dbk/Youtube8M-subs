 In order to defrost the refrigerator, the technician removes the refrigerator from the outlet 

00:00:19.854 --> 00:00:41.000
 The next step - the technician removes the screws that close the plastic lid 

00:00:41.694 --> 00:00:55.000
 Next, the technician tries carefully to remove the lid, without using special force 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
 In order to thaw the ice in the lid, the technician inserts in a syringe of boiling water and injects them into the bare holes of the lid on the sides, and every few minutes tries to open the lid further until the lid comes out of itself (without exerting force) 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:24.800
 The ice has been dropped and now the technician is pulling the lid out 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:33.800
 The technician removes the remaining ice residue on the battery 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:03:30.300
 Now the technician opens the screws of the fan, disassembles everything and takes out the ice 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:04:54.300
 The technician closes everything and puts the lid in place, closing the screws 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:05:07.300
 Plug in and check that the fan is working and the refrigerator has started to cool
