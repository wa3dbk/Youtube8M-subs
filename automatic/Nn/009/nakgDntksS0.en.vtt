00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.900
 Allradler with loading area in the USA 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:21.090
 rarely asked two pick 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.100
 UPS from the Far East should change that 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.789
 double cabin comfortable in the interior 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:28.050
 and strong diesel offer you usefulness 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:31.189
 family suitability and how to see 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.189
 even driving pleasure 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:36.870
 the nissan navara and the mitsubishi 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:40.399
 l200 are Germany's bestsellers 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.399
 the off-road small truck 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:54.650
 the mitsubishi l200 is in the 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:57.830
 third generation modern and comfort 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:59.210
 emphasizes dsp is available the base price 

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:02.470
 for a pickup with his equipment 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:02.470
 is very cheap 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:08.280
 [Applause] 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:10.680
 the nissan offers significantly more power 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.520
 and a larger loading area though 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:16.760
 also for a higher price 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:19.050
 [Music] 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:21.240
 the nissan consumes a bit more fuel 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:23.450
 but his opponent comes but thanks 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.770
 larger tank at the same range 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:29.270
 acceleration and draft are thanks 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.270
 wps much better 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:38.620
 80 percent of the pick-ups will be mainly 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:42.520
 privately used buyers pay attention 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:44.260
 practical ones are also part of the design 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.910
 his edges and five meters pay 20 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:48.280
 length is the nissan navara one 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:50.560
 powerful appearance of the double cabin 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:52.360
 offers space for five, but it works 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.690
 very close to the back seats 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:57.250
 more than short distance is hardly there 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:58.960
 on the other hand, the occupants enjoy a lot in the front 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:01.790
 place also in the broad 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:06.599
 The cockpit is unaffectedly factual 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:06.599
 [Music] 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:12.930
 the four-wheel drive is electric 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:16.059
 switchable air conditioning costs extra 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.059
 [Music] 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:20.140
 the footboard is not for entry 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:21.020
 really necessary and sets in terrain as 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:24.189
 first on 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:24.189
 [Music] 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:29.180
 the large cargo area of ​​the navara measures in 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:32.920
 the diagonal proud 210 and offers 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.920
 place for a whole seven strobles 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:40.370
 [Music] 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.780
 the diagonal of the mitsubishi is 26 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:43.550
 centimeters shorter 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:50.900
 only five bales of straw can be found here 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:52.880
 The new L200 is for one accomodate 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:54.290
 pickup very modern designed the 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:56.700
 line guidance comes from me to 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:03:02.190
 history race car 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:04.200
 [Music] 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:07.170
 here, too, the footboard is more chic 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:09.630
 as practically downright relaxed 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:12.870
 the fond passengers get carried away 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:15.300
 there is less space in the front of the interior 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:18.930
 modern styled with blue fittings 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:20.510
 a watcher no truck but now car 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:23.870
 haptics 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:25.629
 [Music] 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:28.489
 climate also costs mitsubishi 

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:30.440
 extra charge permanent all-wheel with 

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:34.519
 Central differential is in this case 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:36.090
 a nice gimmick the electric series 

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:38.780
 Retractable rear windows 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:41.730
 [Music] 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:43.800
 the modern 2.5 liter common rail diesel 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:46.500
 runs very rough and suffers from one 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:49.819
 clear turbo lag at least met 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:54.380
 he with particle filter the euro 4 standard 

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:54.380
 top without and also without filter 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:08.230
 Pick-ups have to prove themselves in the terrain 

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:08.620
 the miss choice is longer than a s 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:11.140
 class 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:13.390
 its wheelbase gigantic that sets 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:15.990
 especially with footboard borders and 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:15.990
 on groups 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:22.980
 Research and ramp angles are at 

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:24.030
 shorter mitsubishi l200 better that 

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:26.010
 But does not mean that he in the 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:28.550
 terrain features overall the nose 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:28.550
 has in front 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:38.949
 short seal from the German allrad combined 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:41.410
 find out for us which pickup of the 

00:04:38.949 --> 00:04:43.300
 better offroader is the nissan navara 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:47.169
 convince him immediately with his 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:53.530
 more extreme reduction excellent 

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:56.800
 here the reduction with 267 absolutely 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:59.500
 Perfect steep mountain runs are here 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:02.169
 possible without the brake ever press 

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:04.630
 To have the engine brakes and completely 

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:07.479
 that alone is a lot of fun 

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:10.840
 The car is always grateful and gives 

00:05:07.479 --> 00:05:13.389
 a lot of security in things 

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:16.050
 terrain reduction can not the l200 

00:05:13.389 --> 00:05:19.600
 keep up but he has other qualities 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:24.150
 Here in offroad terrain with a 

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:26.620
 submission and the hero of the 1.9 

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:30.700
 that's a little bit that could be 

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:32.620
 to be a little better because neither in the relationship 

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:34.389
 attaches to the rhader the shorter one 

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:36.550
 The entanglement is pretty neat 

00:05:34.389 --> 00:05:38.590
 The handling is very clean too 

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:41.110
 comfortable to drive in the terrain 

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:43.600
 we need a bit of the brake 

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:46.020
 which then basically never something 

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:48.430
 load changes the front axle leads 

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:50.940
 thus the angle of the slope something 

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:54.220
 it does not necessarily decrease positively 

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:58.840
 but overall we loose even heavy 

00:05:54.220 --> 00:06:00.460
 Terrain suitable for use by the Nissan 

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:02.620
 navara beats himself despite his 

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:04.780
 huge wheelbase and way too early 

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:07.650
 putting on footboards in terrain 

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:07.650
 surprisingly good 

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:18.120
 the handling is with the far quite 

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:20.640
 to compare with the navara something 

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:22.650
 looks rockier and not quite so 

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:24.540
 comfortable when it comes to terrain and 

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:27.330
 he can also be on the street with the 

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:30.110
 It's too much for me 200 

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:30.110
 not quite keep up 

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:38.620
 In a way, it should be mentioned that the 

00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:40.870
 Mitsubishi L200 50 mm value depth 

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:42.880
 can be and also at the front 

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:46.030
 a slightly better angle I 

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:50.800
 and there is nissan 

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:52.630
 Nevertheless, he often states that 

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:56.260
 the nissan is a bit more compact here 

00:06:52.630 --> 00:07:00.270
 makes the impression and thus the open 

00:06:56.260 --> 00:07:00.270
 evaluation for you 

00:07:03.139 --> 00:07:08.419
 Conclusion total, the Mitsubishi l200 

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:10.030
 in terms of price equipment security 

00:07:08.419 --> 00:07:12.560
 and environment the nose 

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:14.389
 if you want to go to the terrain, come with me 

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:16.939
 the islam at his expense 

00:07:14.389 --> 00:07:19.300
 Both offer plenty of pickup own 

00:07:16.939 --> 00:07:19.300
 driving pleasure
