00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
quite tight early at the first but the

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:34.610 
quite tight early at the first but the
reason<00:00:33.719> why<00:00:33.840> you<00:00:33.899> want<00:00:34.110> to<00:00:34.200> do<00:00:34.350> that<00:00:34.500> is

reason why you want to do that is

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.920 
reason why you want to do that is
because<00:00:34.739> losing<00:00:35.250> chips<00:00:35.760> is<00:00:35.940> catastrophic

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930

yes winning tips is good but losing
chips<00:00:39.840> is<00:00:40.020> way<00:00:40.440> worse<00:00:40.770> than<00:00:41.190> the<00:00:41.460> positives<00:00:41.969> of

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
chips is way worse than the positives of

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.270 
chips is way worse than the positives of
winning<00:00:42.660> chips<00:00:42.960> you<00:00:43.379> just<00:00:43.559> want<00:00:43.739> to<00:00:43.800> hang<00:00:44.070> in

why I'd have preferred you to fold

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.619 
why I'd have preferred you to fold
preflop<00:02:22.739> yes<00:02:23.099> it<00:02:23.280> was<00:02:23.430> quite<00:02:23.640> cheap<00:02:24.120> it<00:02:24.360> wasn't

00:02:24.619 --> 00:02:24.629 
preflop yes it was quite cheap it wasn't

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:26.869 
preflop yes it was quite cheap it wasn't
a<00:02:24.720> big<00:02:25.260> raise<00:02:25.470> at<00:02:25.680> all<00:02:25.890> but<00:02:26.519> it's<00:02:26.670> just<00:02:26.790> gonna

00:02:26.869 --> 00:02:26.879 
a big raise at all but it's just gonna

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:28.280 
a big raise at all but it's just gonna
be<00:02:27.000> really<00:02:27.060> hard<00:02:27.480> for<00:02:27.569> you<00:02:27.720> to<00:02:27.750> play<00:02:27.989> your<00:02:28.019> hand

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
be really hard for you to play your hand

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.009 
be really hard for you to play your hand
profitably<00:02:28.920> out<00:02:29.190> of<00:02:29.550> position<00:02:30.000> free<00:02:30.360> ways<00:02:30.629> and

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:31.019 
profitably out of position free ways and

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:33.860 
profitably out of position free ways and
so<00:02:31.799> I<00:02:31.830> just<00:02:32.129> think<00:02:32.310> saving<00:02:32.819> those<00:02:33.239> 60<00:02:33.660> tips

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
so I just think saving those 60 tips

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.479 
so I just think saving those 60 tips
were<00:02:34.080> in<00:02:34.200> better<00:02:34.379> but<00:02:34.799> anyway<00:02:35.250> it's<00:02:35.370> been

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:35.489 
were in better but anyway it's been

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:40.009 
were in better but anyway it's been
checked<00:02:35.730> around<00:02:38.120> eight<00:02:39.120> on<00:02:39.420> the<00:02:39.510> turnin<00:02:39.840> and

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:40.019 
checked around eight on the turnin and

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:41.030 
checked around eight on the turnin and
you<00:02:40.140> should<00:02:40.379> get<00:02:40.530> into<00:02:40.620> a<00:02:40.709> lot<00:02:40.830> of<00:02:40.860> trouble

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
you should get into a lot of trouble

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.479

running<00:04:19.349> big<00:04:19.590> Bluffs<00:04:19.859> in<00:04:20.130> dy<00:04:20.459> arms<00:04:20.669> is

running big Bluffs in dy arms is

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:21.440 
running big Bluffs in dy arms is
profitable

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:21.450 
profitable

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:23.360 
profitable
I<00:04:21.570> think<00:04:21.780> players<00:04:21.989> know<00:04:22.380> that<00:04:22.650> by<00:04:22.830> now<00:04:22.860> and

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:23.370 
I think players know that by now and

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:25.459 
I think players know that by now and
when<00:04:24.000> your<00:04:24.270> opponent's<00:04:24.659> betting<00:04:24.990> that<00:04:25.140> amount

00:04:25.459 --> 00:04:25.469 
when your opponent's betting that amount

00:04:25.469 --> 00:04:26.150 
when your opponent's betting that amount
I<00:04:25.620> think<00:04:25.680> your

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:26.160 
I think your

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.250 
I think your
so<00:04:26.280> really<00:04:26.730> good<00:04:26.940> here<00:04:27.180> but<00:04:27.660> we<00:04:27.750> have<00:04:27.930> to<00:04:27.960> fold

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:28.260 
so really good here but we have to fold

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.080 
so really good here but we have to fold
it<00:04:28.410> may<00:04:28.860> only<00:04:29.040> sound<00:04:29.250> like<00:04:29.340> 200<00:04:29.700> tips<00:04:29.910> but

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:30.090 
it may only sound like 200 tips but

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:32.480 
it may only sound like 200 tips but
that's<00:04:30.270> 10%<00:04:30.600> of<00:04:31.110> your<00:04:31.260> stat<00:04:31.530> no<00:04:31.740> I'm<00:04:31.890> fully

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:32.490 
that's 10% of your stat no I'm fully

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:33.950 
that's 10% of your stat no I'm fully
aware<00:04:32.700> of<00:04:32.760> how<00:04:32.940> much<00:04:33.060> it<00:04:33.210> is<00:04:33.300> to<00:04:33.420> my<00:04:33.570> stack<00:04:33.810> but

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:33.960 
aware of how much it is to my stack but

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:36.650 
aware of how much it is to my stack but
I<00:04:34.020> do<00:04:34.080> think<00:04:34.350> I<00:04:34.500> still<00:04:34.800> call<00:04:35.190> here<00:04:35.640> and<00:04:35.790> maybe

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:36.660 
I do think I still call here and maybe

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:38.660 
I do think I still call here and maybe
that's<00:04:36.810> the<00:04:36.900> leak<00:04:37.080> in<00:04:37.200> my<00:04:37.230> game<00:04:37.530> I<00:04:37.830> think<00:04:38.460> it<00:04:38.550> is

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:38.670 
that's the leak in my game I think it is

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:40.520 
that's the leak in my game I think it is
I<00:04:38.850> think<00:04:38.880> I<00:04:39.180> think<00:04:39.420> you're<00:04:39.750> rarely<00:04:40.050> beaten

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:40.530 
I think I think you're rarely beaten

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:42.590 
I think I think you're rarely beaten
here<00:04:40.680> I<00:04:40.710> don't<00:04:40.920> think<00:04:41.160> we<00:04:41.250> ever<00:04:41.280> see<00:04:41.610> 884

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:42.600 
here I don't think we ever see 884

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:44.690 
here I don't think we ever see 884
betting<00:04:43.110> King<00:04:43.380> Queen<00:04:43.680> here<00:04:43.890> for<00:04:44.070> example<00:04:44.310> and

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:44.700 
betting King Queen here for example and

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:47.030 
betting King Queen here for example and
if<00:04:45.270> we<00:04:45.450> if<00:04:45.660> he's<00:04:45.810> not<00:04:46.020> bluffing<00:04:46.260> very<00:04:46.620> often

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:47.040 
if we if he's not bluffing very often

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:49.310 
if we if he's not bluffing very often
and<00:04:47.490> he's<00:04:47.580> not<00:04:47.760> betting<00:04:47.970> we're<00:04:48.300> sands<00:04:48.630> we're

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:49.320 
and he's not betting we're sands we're

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:51.710 
and he's not betting we're sands we're
not<00:04:49.440> really<00:04:49.650> beating<00:04:50.100> that<00:04:50.280> much<00:04:50.490> so<00:04:50.820> you<00:04:51.060> do

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:51.720 
not really beating that much so you do

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:53.840 
not really beating that much so you do
call<00:04:51.990> and<00:04:52.230> immediately<00:04:53.130> we<00:04:53.280> can<00:04:53.430> see<00:04:53.610> but<00:04:53.790> just

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:53.850 
call and immediately we can see but just

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:55.790 
call and immediately we can see but just
get<00:04:54.210> involved<00:04:54.660> at<00:04:54.750> Ace<00:04:54.870> 9<00:04:54.900> which<00:04:55.380> I<00:04:55.500> think<00:04:55.680> was

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:55.800 
get involved at Ace 9 which I think was

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:58.370 
get involved at Ace 9 which I think was
a<00:04:55.830> slight<00:04:56.220> error<00:04:56.610> has<00:04:57.420> crippled<00:04:58.020> your<00:04:58.110> stack

00:04:58.370 --> 00:04:58.380 
a slight error has crippled your stack

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:01.550 
a slight error has crippled your stack
by<00:04:58.610> 25%<00:04:59.610> earlier<00:05:00.060> than<00:05:00.240> a<00:05:00.300> DUI<00:05:00.510> em<00:05:00.840> that's

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:03.710 
by 25% earlier than a DUI em that's

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:05.970 
really that big of a deal but in a deal

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:08.090 
really that big of a deal but in a deal
I<00:05:06.180> am<00:05:06.210> that<00:05:06.720> could<00:05:06.930> be<00:05:07.080> massive<00:05:07.470> when<00:05:07.980> the

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:08.100 
I am that could be massive when the

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:11.360 
I am that could be massive when the
blinds<00:05:08.340> right<00:05:08.640> blinds<00:05:09.300> raise<00:05:09.630> later<00:05:10.140> on<00:05:10.410> yeah

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:11.370 
blinds right blinds raise later on yeah

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:13.760 
blinds right blinds raise later on yeah
I<00:05:11.400> must<00:05:12.030> admit<00:05:12.270> I've<00:05:12.420> been<00:05:12.990> a<00:05:13.170> bit<00:05:13.320> rusty<00:05:13.740> on

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:13.770 
I must admit I've been a bit rusty on

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:15.380 
I must admit I've been a bit rusty on
dym<00:05:14.370> so<00:05:14.490> that's<00:05:14.640> the<00:05:14.730> first<00:05:14.880> time<00:05:15.060> I<00:05:15.150> played

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:15.390 
dym so that's the first time I played

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:18.650 
dym so that's the first time I played
them<00:05:15.660> in<00:05:15.780> in<00:05:16.080> a<00:05:16.200> while<00:05:16.530> and<00:05:16.950> I<00:05:17.520> know<00:05:18.030> just<00:05:18.540> from

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:18.660 
them in in a while and I know just from

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:19.880 
them in in a while and I know just from
experience<00:05:18.750> in<00:05:19.230> playing<00:05:19.380> them<00:05:19.560> over<00:05:19.740> and<00:05:19.860> over

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:19.890 
experience in playing them over and over

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:22.400 
experience in playing them over and over
and<00:05:20.130> over<00:05:20.220> again<00:05:20.400> eventually<00:05:21.180> you<00:05:21.480> become<00:05:21.690> so

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:22.410 
and over again eventually you become so

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:24.500 
and over again eventually you become so
tight<00:05:22.860> so<00:05:23.340> hand<00:05:23.640> selective<00:05:24.120> in<00:05:24.210> those<00:05:24.360> first

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:24.510 
tight so hand selective in those first

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:27.770 
tight so hand selective in those first
two<00:05:24.690> or<00:05:24.870> three<00:05:25.160> blind<00:05:26.160> levels<00:05:26.640> that<00:05:26.940> you<00:05:27.540> would

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:27.780 
two or three blind levels that you would

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:30.230 
two or three blind levels that you would
possibly<00:05:28.050> think<00:05:28.560> about<00:05:28.650> folding<00:05:29.490> anything

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:30.240 
possibly think about folding anything

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:32.930 
possibly think about folding anything
from<00:05:30.510> the<00:05:30.990> nines<00:05:31.320> downwards<00:05:32.070> and<00:05:32.310> you<00:05:32.730> just

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:32.940 
from the nines downwards and you just

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:34.100 
from the nines downwards and you just
get<00:05:33.090> rid<00:05:33.210> of<00:05:33.270> everything<00:05:33.540> it<00:05:33.750> all<00:05:33.870> goes<00:05:34.050> back

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:34.110 
get rid of everything it all goes back

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:37.580 
get rid of everything it all goes back
to<00:05:34.380> the<00:05:34.410> theory<00:05:34.890> of<00:05:35.780> saving<00:05:36.780> tips<00:05:37.020> is<00:05:37.230> far<00:05:37.440> more

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:37.590 
to the theory of saving tips is far more

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:39.410 
to the theory of saving tips is far more
important<00:05:37.950> for<00:05:38.040> the<00:05:38.130> accumulating<00:05:38.820> chips<00:05:39.120> so

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:39.420 
important for the accumulating chips so

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:40.850 
important for the accumulating chips so
we<00:05:39.810> just<00:05:39.960> don't<00:05:40.140> want<00:05:40.260> to<00:05:40.290> take<00:05:40.470> on<00:05:40.620> any

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:40.860 
we just don't want to take on any

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:43.190 
we just don't want to take on any
marginal<00:05:41.580> spots<00:05:41.880> and<00:05:42.090> that<00:05:42.180> includes<00:05:42.570> calling

generally<00:05:47.010> speaking<00:05:47.130> from<00:05:47.940> my<00:05:48.090> experience<00:05:48.660> of

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:48.780 
generally speaking from my experience of

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:51.320 
generally speaking from my experience of
playing<00:05:49.080> them<00:05:49.350> you're<00:05:49.590> looking<00:05:50.040> to<00:05:50.280> outlast<00:05:51.150> a

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:51.330 
playing them you're looking to outlast a

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:52.460 
playing them you're looking to outlast a
couple<00:05:51.570> of<00:05:51.660> players<00:05:51.840> aren't<00:05:52.200> you<00:05:52.290> you're

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:52.470 
couple of players aren't you you're

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:54.650 
couple of players aren't you you're
looking<00:05:52.650> to<00:05:52.919> not<00:05:53.130> play<00:05:53.340> at<00:05:53.490> all<00:05:53.640> and<00:05:53.940> before

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:54.660 
looking to not play at all and before

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:55.970 
looking to not play at all and before
you<00:05:54.780> know<00:05:54.930> it<00:05:54.960> two<00:05:55.320> players<00:05:55.620> are<00:05:55.830> not

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:55.980 
you know it two players are not

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:57.620 
you know it two players are not
themselves<00:05:56.370> out<00:05:56.850> and<00:05:57.030> you're<00:05:57.210> down<00:05:57.390> to<00:05:57.540> the

00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:57.630 
themselves out and you're down to the

00:05:57.630 --> 00:05:59.330 
themselves out and you're down to the
last<00:05:57.870> four<00:05:58.200> so<00:05:58.440> you're<00:05:58.560> effectively<00:05:58.740> four

00:05:59.330 --> 00:05:59.340 
last four so you're effectively four

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:01.430 
last four so you're effectively four
players<00:05:59.640> playing<00:06:00.360> for<00:06:00.570> three<00:06:00.750> spots<00:06:01.200> like<00:06:01.410> a

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:01.440 
players playing for three spots like a

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:03.350 
players playing for three spots like a
like<00:06:01.800> a<00:06:01.830> game<00:06:02.070> of<00:06:02.220> musical<00:06:02.280> chairs<00:06:02.610> for<00:06:03.240> if

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:03.360 
like a game of musical chairs for if

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:04.610 
like a game of musical chairs for if
you're<00:06:03.480> running<00:06:03.720> around<00:06:03.780> three<00:06:04.110> chairs<00:06:04.410> and

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:04.620 
you're running around three chairs and

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:05.930 
you're running around three chairs and
more<00:06:05.040> often<00:06:05.160> than<00:06:05.310> not<00:06:05.400> you're<00:06:05.610> going<00:06:05.790> to<00:06:05.880> be

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:05.940 
more often than not you're going to be

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:06.890 
more often than not you're going to be
one<00:06:06.030> of<00:06:06.090> those<00:06:06.210> people<00:06:06.390> on<00:06:06.600> one<00:06:06.720> of<00:06:06.750> those

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:06.900 
one of those people on one of those

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:08.680 
one of those people on one of those
chairs<00:06:07.230> when<00:06:07.470> the<00:06:07.560> music<00:06:07.890> stops<00:06:08.160> aren't<00:06:08.430> you

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:08.690 
chairs when the music stops aren't you

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:11.330 
chairs when the music stops aren't you
that's<00:06:09.690> that's<00:06:10.169> if<00:06:10.620> you<00:06:10.919> just<00:06:11.070> keep<00:06:11.250> yourself

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:11.340 
that's that's if you just keep yourself

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:12.110 
that's that's if you just keep yourself
out<00:06:11.610> of<00:06:11.700> trouble

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:12.120 
out of trouble

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:13.909 
out of trouble
that's<00:06:12.540> very<00:06:12.840> easy<00:06:13.080> to<00:06:13.260> do<00:06:13.410> for<00:06:13.590> new<00:06:13.680> players

00:06:13.909 --> 00:06:13.919 
that's very easy to do for new players

00:06:13.919 --> 00:06:15.740 
that's very easy to do for new players
you<00:06:14.130> literally<00:06:14.430> just<00:06:14.700> don't<00:06:14.940> do<00:06:15.150> anything<00:06:15.390> and

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:15.750 
you literally just don't do anything and

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:17.810 
you literally just don't do anything and
you'll<00:06:16.320> find<00:06:16.620> yourself<00:06:16.740> in<00:06:17.100> a<00:06:17.250> in<00:06:17.460> a<00:06:17.580> four

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:17.820 
you'll find yourself in a in a four

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:19.280 
you'll find yourself in a in a four
player<00:06:18.030> game<00:06:18.120> before<00:06:18.660> a<00:06:18.690> long<00:06:18.840> one<00:06:18.990> I<00:06:19.110> like

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:19.290 
player game before a long one I like

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:21.080 
player game before a long one I like
that<00:06:19.470> analogy<00:06:19.560> and<00:06:20.040> if<00:06:20.160> you<00:06:20.340> can<00:06:20.520> get<00:06:20.760> to<00:06:20.970> that

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:21.090 
that analogy and if you can get to that

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:22.850 
that analogy and if you can get to that
bubble<00:06:21.450> stage<00:06:21.630> where<00:06:21.900> four<00:06:22.169> players<00:06:22.470> are<00:06:22.710> left

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:22.860 
bubble stage where four players are left
