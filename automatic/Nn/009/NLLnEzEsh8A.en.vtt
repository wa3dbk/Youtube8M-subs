00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:14.620 
as woodworkers for the most part what we

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:17.579 
as woodworkers for the most part what we
hear<00:00:14.860> about<00:00:14.890> our<00:00:15.599> HVLP<00:00:16.599> type<00:00:17.019> sprayers<00:00:17.439> that

00:00:17.579 --> 00:00:17.589 
hear about our HVLP type sprayers that

00:00:17.589 --> 00:00:19.409 
hear about our HVLP type sprayers that
we<00:00:17.829> would<00:00:17.980> use<00:00:18.189> for<00:00:18.220> spraying<00:00:18.669> top<00:00:18.939> coats<00:00:19.240> on

00:00:19.409 --> 00:00:19.419 
we would use for spraying top coats on

00:00:19.419 --> 00:00:22.439 
we would use for spraying top coats on
woodworking<00:00:19.749> projects<00:00:20.409> but<00:00:21.150> airless<00:00:22.150> sprayer

you built out of MDF or poplar and

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:33.810 
you built out of MDF or poplar and
instead<00:00:32.320> of<00:00:32.439> staining<00:00:32.980> and<00:00:33.100> top<00:00:33.280> coating<00:00:33.699> it

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:33.820 
instead of staining and top coating it

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:35.610 
instead of staining and top coating it
your<00:00:33.969> plan<00:00:34.180> all<00:00:34.420> along<00:00:34.449> is<00:00:34.930> to<00:00:34.989> paint<00:00:35.440> it

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:35.620 
your plan all along is to paint it

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:38.669 
your plan all along is to paint it
happens<00:00:36.250> all<00:00:36.399> the<00:00:36.430> time<00:00:36.930> the<00:00:37.930> airless<00:00:38.350> sprayer

00:00:38.669 --> 00:00:38.679 
happens all the time the airless sprayer

00:00:38.679 --> 00:00:40.680 
happens all the time the airless sprayer
is<00:00:38.800> like<00:00:38.980> this<00:00:39.219> are<00:00:39.489> really<00:00:39.699> really<00:00:40.059> good<00:00:40.269> at

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:40.690 
is like this are really really good at

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:42.750 
is like this are really really good at
getting<00:00:41.109> on<00:00:41.199> a<00:00:41.230> layer<00:00:41.530> of<00:00:41.769> paint<00:00:42.010> they're<00:00:42.550> not

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:42.760 
getting on a layer of paint they're not

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:44.490 
getting on a layer of paint they're not
so<00:00:42.969> good<00:00:43.120> at<00:00:43.269> doing<00:00:43.510> topcoat<00:00:43.989> so<00:00:44.170> here's<00:00:44.379> what

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:44.500 
so good at doing topcoat so here's what

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.250 
so good at doing topcoat so here's what
we've<00:00:44.620> got<00:00:44.649> here<00:00:45.070> with<00:00:45.730> this<00:00:45.940> one<00:00:46.210> the<00:00:47.079> way<00:00:47.230> it

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:47.260 
we've got here with this one the way it

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.410 
we've got here with this one the way it
works<00:00:47.589> is<00:00:47.829> that<00:00:47.859> we're<00:00:48.219> not<00:00:48.309> providing<00:00:48.910> air<00:00:49.179> to

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:49.420 
works is that we're not providing air to

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:50.880 
works is that we're not providing air to
the<00:00:49.570> system<00:00:50.019> as<00:00:50.199> would<00:00:50.500> come<00:00:50.679> from<00:00:50.800> a

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:50.890 
the system as would come from a

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:53.009 
the system as would come from a
compressor<00:00:51.429> or<00:00:51.730> a<00:00:51.789> turbine<00:00:52.239> we're<00:00:52.719> providing

00:00:53.009 --> 00:00:53.019 
compressor or a turbine we're providing

00:00:53.019 --> 00:00:55.439 
compressor or a turbine we're providing
electricity<00:00:53.530> to<00:00:53.800> it<00:00:54.070> there's<00:00:54.640> a<00:00:54.699> pump<00:00:54.999> inside

00:00:55.439 --> 00:00:55.449 
electricity to it there's a pump inside

00:00:55.449 --> 00:00:57.720 
electricity to it there's a pump inside
here<00:00:55.839> when<00:00:56.320> we<00:00:56.469> run<00:00:56.739> this<00:00:56.980> when<00:00:57.160> I<00:00:57.190> squeeze<00:00:57.579> the

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:57.730 
here when we run this when I squeeze the

00:00:57.730 --> 00:00:59.819 
here when we run this when I squeeze the
trigger<00:00:57.760> the<00:00:58.480> pump<00:00:58.749> is<00:00:58.899> going<00:00:59.050> to<00:00:59.140> pull<00:00:59.350> liquid

00:00:59.819 --> 00:00:59.829 
trigger the pump is going to pull liquid

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:02.399 
trigger the pump is going to pull liquid
up<00:00:59.980> out<00:01:00.159> from<00:01:00.550> the<00:01:00.640> pot<00:01:00.850> down<00:01:01.120> here<00:01:01.539> push<00:01:02.260> it

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:02.409 
up out from the pot down here push it

00:01:02.409 --> 00:01:04.410 
up out from the pot down here push it
out<00:01:02.530> the<00:01:02.710> nozzle<00:01:03.129> they<00:01:03.640> work<00:01:03.879> really<00:01:04.239> really

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:04.420 
out the nozzle they work really really

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:08.160 
out the nozzle they work really really
well<00:01:04.930> for<00:01:05.500> thick-bodied<00:01:06.250> stuff<00:01:07.060> like<00:01:07.600> paint

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:08.170 
well for thick-bodied stuff like paint

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:09.840 
well for thick-bodied stuff like paint
so<00:01:08.650> that's<00:01:08.830> kind<00:01:09.070> of<00:01:09.130> the<00:01:09.220> line<00:01:09.400> in<00:01:09.580> the<00:01:09.670> sand

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:09.850 
so that's kind of the line in the sand

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:12.510 
so that's kind of the line in the sand
if<00:01:10.090> you're<00:01:10.210> spraying<00:01:10.830> polyurethane<00:01:11.830> lacquer

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:12.520 
if you're spraying polyurethane lacquer

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:15.450 
if you're spraying polyurethane lacquer
shellac<00:01:13.420> you<00:01:13.990> really<00:01:14.320> are<00:01:14.470> better<00:01:14.770> you're

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:15.460 
shellac you really are better you're

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:17.790 
shellac you really are better you're
really<00:01:15.700> are<00:01:15.790> better<00:01:15.970> off<00:01:16.180> with<00:01:16.810> an<00:01:16.960> HVLP<00:01:17.500> gun

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:17.800 
really are better off with an HVLP gun

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.560 
really are better off with an HVLP gun
that<00:01:18.250> you<00:01:18.340> would<00:01:18.490> run<00:01:18.640> on<00:01:18.700> an<00:01:19.240> air<00:01:19.420> compressor

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:19.570 
that you would run on an air compressor

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:22.080 
that you would run on an air compressor
or<00:01:20.110> a<00:01:20.170> turbine<00:01:20.650> if<00:01:21.130> you<00:01:21.310> want<00:01:21.460> to<00:01:21.550> spray<00:01:21.790> paint

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:22.090 
or a turbine if you want to spray paint

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:24.120 
or a turbine if you want to spray paint
because<00:01:22.630> it's<00:01:22.810> so<00:01:22.960> thick<00:01:23.320> you're<00:01:23.800> better<00:01:24.040> off

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:24.130 
because it's so thick you're better off

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:26.430 
because it's so thick you're better off
with<00:01:24.490> an<00:01:24.610> airless<00:01:25.000> like<00:01:25.300> this<00:01:25.570> so<00:01:26.110> here's<00:01:26.320> what

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:26.440 
with an airless like this so here's what

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.830 
with an airless like this so here's what
we've<00:01:26.560> got<00:01:26.590> going<00:01:26.950> this<00:01:27.490> particular<00:01:28.120> one<00:01:28.360> is<00:01:28.600> a

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:28.840 
we've got going this particular one is a

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.680 
we've got going this particular one is a
two-speed<00:01:29.560> gun<00:01:29.860> so<00:01:30.460> I<00:01:30.490> can<00:01:30.790> change<00:01:31.150> the<00:01:31.330> speed

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:31.690 
two-speed gun so I can change the speed

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:34.110 
two-speed gun so I can change the speed
setting<00:01:32.020> here<00:01:32.410> which<00:01:32.740> is<00:01:32.980> affected<00:01:33.460> by<00:01:33.640> the

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:34.120 
setting here which is affected by the

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:36.060 
setting here which is affected by the
viscosity<00:01:34.510> the<00:01:34.810> thickness<00:01:34.960> of<00:01:35.530> the<00:01:35.920> liquid

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:36.070 
viscosity the thickness of the liquid

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:38.160 
viscosity the thickness of the liquid
I'm<00:01:36.340> spraying<00:01:36.670> right<00:01:37.270> now<00:01:37.420> I<00:01:37.450> just<00:01:37.570> got<00:01:37.870> water

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.170 
I'm spraying right now I just got water

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:40.080 
I'm spraying right now I just got water
in<00:01:38.410> here<00:01:38.650> so<00:01:39.040> it'll<00:01:39.280> come<00:01:39.400> out<00:01:39.460> just<00:01:39.760> fine<00:01:40.030> on

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.090 
in here so it'll come out just fine on

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:42.540 
in here so it'll come out just fine on
that<00:01:40.390> low<00:01:40.630> speed<00:01:41.020> setting<00:01:41.410> I<00:01:41.590> can<00:01:42.040> also<00:01:42.190> turn

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:42.550 
that low speed setting I can also turn

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:44.970 
that low speed setting I can also turn
this<00:01:42.850> knob<00:01:43.150> and<00:01:43.570> I<00:01:44.020> can<00:01:44.200> control<00:01:44.590> the<00:01:44.770> amount

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:44.980 
this knob and I can control the amount

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:47.760 
this knob and I can control the amount
of<00:01:45.190> fluid<00:01:45.610> that<00:01:45.640> comes<00:01:46.120> out<00:01:46.330> the<00:01:46.540> front<00:01:46.690> I<00:01:47.020> can

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:47.770 
of fluid that comes out the front I can

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:51.060 
of fluid that comes out the front I can
turn<00:01:48.220> this<00:01:49.150> and<00:01:49.630> I<00:01:50.140> can<00:01:50.350> control<00:01:50.650> whether<00:01:50.950> I

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:51.070 
turn this and I can control whether I

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:53.310 
turn this and I can control whether I
have<00:01:51.280> a<00:01:51.310> vertical<00:01:51.640> fan<00:01:52.090> or<00:01:52.330> a<00:01:52.360> horizontal<00:01:52.600> fan
