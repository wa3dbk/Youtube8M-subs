my<00:00:27.970> pleasure<00:00:28.269> in<00:00:28.599> the<00:00:28.779> building

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:38.540 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:40.060 

yeah<00:00:38.840> the<00:00:39.020> silver<00:00:39.350> device<00:00:39.620> that<00:00:39.830> we<00:00:39.920> have

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:40.070 
yeah the silver device that we have

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:42.250 
yeah the silver device that we have
behind<00:00:40.310> the<00:00:40.490> antis<00:00:40.760> photo<00:00:41.000> dynamometer<00:00:41.450> the

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:42.260 
behind the antis photo dynamometer the

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.050 
behind the antis photo dynamometer the
dynamometer<00:00:42.680> allows<00:00:43.040> us<00:00:43.250> to<00:00:43.370> test<00:00:43.580> our<00:00:43.730> engine

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:44.060 
dynamometer allows us to test our engine

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:45.780 
dynamometer allows us to test our engine
so<00:00:44.150> that<00:00:44.330> we<00:00:44.420> can<00:00:44.570> get<00:00:44.690> the<00:00:44.840> best<00:00:45.020> fuel<00:00:45.680> economy

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:45.790 
so that we can get the best fuel economy

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:48.790 
so that we can get the best fuel economy
horsepower<00:00:46.790> torque<00:00:47.210> enters<00:00:48.080> that<00:00:48.380> gives<00:00:48.620> you

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:48.800 
horsepower torque enters that gives you

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.580 
horsepower torque enters that gives you
the<00:00:48.830> engines<00:00:49.370> with<00:00:49.520> long<00:00:49.730> life<00:00:49.970> defensibility

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:50.590 
the engines with long life defensibility

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:54.250

here<00:02:55.430> right<00:02:55.730> now<00:02:55.910> the<00:02:56.360> thing<00:02:56.600> that's

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
here right now the thing that's

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:58.810 
here right now the thing that's
important<00:02:57.290> is<00:02:57.350> how<00:02:57.740> quickly<00:02:58.190> it<00:02:58.460> goes<00:02:58.490> from

00:02:58.810 --> 00:02:58.820 
important is how quickly it goes from

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:01.810 
important is how quickly it goes from
four<00:02:59.120> to<00:02:59.270> eight<00:02:59.410> so<00:03:00.410> it's<00:03:00.470> about<00:03:00.710> length<00:03:01.670> of

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:01.820 
four to eight so it's about length of
