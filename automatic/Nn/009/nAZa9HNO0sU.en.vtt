if you kill these guys they do take
quite<00:01:26.670> a<00:01:26.729> lot<00:01:26.970> of<00:01:27.060> hits<00:01:27.270> at<00:01:27.479> you<00:01:27.630> at<00:01:27.720> the<00:01:27.780> moment

quite a lot of hits at you at the moment

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.990 
quite a lot of hits at you at the moment
I<00:01:28.290> don't<00:01:28.409> know<00:01:28.770> this<00:01:28.920> is<00:01:29.040> going<00:01:29.130> to<00:01:29.250> change<00:01:29.280> in

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
I don't know this is going to change in

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.440 
I don't know this is going to change in
the<00:01:30.869> one<00:01:31.530> point<00:01:31.770> to<00:01:31.979> release<00:01:32.310> the<00:01:33.240> final

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
the one point to release the final

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.219 
the one point to release the final
release<00:01:33.810> but<00:01:34.470> they<00:01:34.890> drop<00:01:35.130> iron<00:01:35.400> bars<00:01:36.229> and

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
release but they drop iron bars and

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.289 
release but they drop iron bars and
sometimes<00:01:37.740> they<00:01:37.920> drop<00:01:38.130> flowers<00:01:38.670> as<00:01:38.850> well<00:01:39.060> I

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
sometimes they drop flowers as well I

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.060 
sometimes they drop flowers as well I
think<00:01:39.570> they<00:01:39.689> pick<00:01:39.960> up<00:01:40.110> flowers<00:01:40.290> as<00:01:40.770> they<00:01:40.890> move

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
think they pick up flowers as they move

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:47.020 
think they pick up flowers as they move
around<00:01:41.280> which<00:01:41.729> is<00:01:41.850> a<00:01:41.880> bit<00:01:42.090> strange<00:01:42.450> but<00:01:44.390> yeah

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.030 
around which is a bit strange but yeah

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:49.880 
around which is a bit strange but yeah
so<00:01:48.030> yeah<00:01:48.210> that's<00:01:48.360> that's<00:01:49.049> how<00:01:49.259> you<00:01:49.320> build<00:01:49.560> them

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
so yeah that's that's how you build them

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.210 
so yeah that's that's how you build them
a<00:01:50.159> little<00:01:50.790> bit<00:01:51.030> of<00:01:51.180> a<00:01:51.439> sort<00:01:52.439> of<00:01:52.470> hidden<00:01:52.740> chest

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
a little bit of a sort of hidden chest

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.840 
a little bit of a sort of hidden chest
it's<00:01:53.520> not<00:01:53.549> be<00:01:53.759> hidden<00:01:54.090> but<00:01:54.360> you<00:01:54.540> know<00:01:55.850> also

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
it's not be hidden but you know also

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.990 
it's not be hidden but you know also
found<00:01:57.240> out<00:01:57.420> that<00:01:57.479> they<00:01:58.250> attack<00:01:59.250> skeletons<00:01:59.790> as

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
found out that they attack skeletons as

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.090 
found out that they attack skeletons as
well<00:02:00.270> so<00:02:00.930> if<00:02:01.079> I<00:02:01.200> got<00:02:01.740> another

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
well so if I got another

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.929 
well so if I got another
one<00:02:02.220> and<00:02:03.200> yeah<00:02:04.200> they<00:02:04.380> tax<00:02:04.680> curtains<00:02:05.130> I<00:02:05.369> think

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
one and yeah they tax curtains I think

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:08.029 
one and yeah they tax curtains I think
he<00:02:06.060> didn't<00:02:06.270> attack<00:02:06.650> skeleton<00:02:07.650> in<00:02:07.770> the<00:02:07.860> last

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
he didn't attack skeleton in the last

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.370 
he didn't attack skeleton in the last
video<00:02:08.250> is<00:02:08.520> because<00:02:08.700> it<00:02:09.569> was<00:02:09.720> in<00:02:09.840> an<00:02:09.929> odd<00:02:10.050> place

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:10.380 
video is because it was in an odd place

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:13.750 
video is because it was in an odd place
sort<00:02:11.280> of<00:02:11.430> the<00:02:11.910> path<00:02:12.150> thing<00:02:12.450> was<00:02:12.600> a<00:02:12.630> bit<00:02:12.840> glitchy

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
sort of the path thing was a bit glitchy

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.699 
sort of the path thing was a bit glitchy
they<00:02:14.760> are<00:02:14.910> a<00:02:14.940> little<00:02:15.239> bit<00:02:15.480> buggy<00:02:15.900> still<00:02:16.500> at<00:02:16.590> the

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 
they are a little bit buggy still at the

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:21.350 
they are a little bit buggy still at the
moment<00:02:17.390> they<00:02:18.390> aren't<00:02:18.630> perfect<00:02:19.140> so<00:02:20.360> but

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
moment they aren't perfect so but

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.199 
moment they aren't perfect so but
apparently<00:02:21.930> there<00:02:22.200> were<00:02:22.500> their<00:02:23.459> actual<00:02:23.880> name

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
apparently there were their actual name

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:27.470 
apparently there were their actual name
