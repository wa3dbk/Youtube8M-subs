that<00:00:43.559> pose<00:00:44.190> and<00:00:44.760> I<00:00:45.570> felt<00:00:46.079> myself<00:00:46.200> getting

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
that pose and I felt myself getting

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.250 
that pose and I felt myself getting
stronger<00:00:46.890> and<00:00:47.190> stronger<00:00:47.430> each<00:00:47.820> day<00:00:48.230> because<00:00:49.230> I

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
stronger and stronger each day because I

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.069 
stronger and stronger each day because I
was<00:00:49.469> building<00:00:50.010> these<00:00:50.129> muscles<00:00:51.000> and<00:00:51.300> you<00:00:51.960> know

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
was building these muscles and you know

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.260 
was building these muscles and you know
it<00:00:52.410> was<00:00:52.620> getting<00:00:52.770> easier<00:00:53.309> and<00:00:53.370> easier<00:00:53.789> because

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
it was getting easier and easier because

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.090 
it was getting easier and easier because
I<00:00:54.449> was<00:00:54.600> getting<00:00:54.870> stronger<00:00:55.110> and<00:00:55.469> stronger<00:00:55.710> and

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
I was getting stronger and stronger and

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.209 
I was getting stronger and stronger and
that<00:00:56.219> progress<00:00:56.520> was<00:00:56.850> really<00:00:57.180> fun<00:00:57.750> to<00:00:57.960> watch

00:00:58.209 --> 00:00:58.219 
that progress was really fun to watch

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:00.920 
that progress was really fun to watch
and<00:00:59.219> I<00:00:59.280> thought<00:00:59.789> it<00:01:00.059> would<00:01:00.180> get<00:01:00.420> to<00:01:00.570> a<00:01:00.600> point

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
and I thought it would get to a point

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.720 
and I thought it would get to a point
where<00:01:01.170> it<00:01:01.320> became<00:01:01.590> effortless<00:01:02.250> that<00:01:02.280> I<00:01:02.520> could

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
where it became effortless that I could

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.039 
where it became effortless that I could
just<00:01:02.879> hold<00:01:03.149> it<00:01:03.390> up<00:01:03.510> forever

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
just hold it up forever

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.100 
just hold it up forever
well<00:01:04.589> I<00:01:04.949> learned<00:01:05.280> that<00:01:05.549> you<00:01:06.420> know<00:01:06.570> I<00:01:06.600> could

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
well I learned that you know I could

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.020 
well I learned that you know I could
hold<00:01:07.350> it<00:01:07.500> for<00:01:07.530> longer<00:01:07.890> towards<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:08.610> end<00:01:08.790> but

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
hold it for longer towards the end but

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.359 
hold it for longer towards the end but
it<00:01:09.150> never<00:01:09.450> really<00:01:09.750> became<00:01:10.040> effortless<00:01:11.040> and

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
it never really became effortless and

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.030 
it never really became effortless and
that's<00:01:11.909> because<00:01:12.299> you<00:01:12.869> always<00:01:13.290> have<00:01:13.650> to<00:01:13.830> be

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
that's because you always have to be

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.340 
that's because you always have to be
trying<00:01:14.820> you<00:01:15.180> always<00:01:15.479> have<00:01:15.600> to<00:01:15.720> be<00:01:15.840> doing<00:01:16.200> your

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
trying you always have to be doing your

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.080 
trying you always have to be doing your
best<00:01:16.650> and<00:01:16.950> when<00:01:17.369> you're<00:01:17.490> doing<00:01:17.790> your<00:01:17.909> best

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
best and when you're doing your best

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.910 
best and when you're doing your best
you're<00:01:18.479> pushing<00:01:18.930> yourself<00:01:19.049> and<00:01:19.439> that<00:01:19.619> takes

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
you're pushing yourself and that takes

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.219 
you're pushing yourself and that takes
effort<00:01:20.250> you<00:01:20.700> know<00:01:20.820> it<00:01:21.180> never<00:01:21.360> gets<00:01:21.659> too<00:01:21.930> easy

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
effort you know it never gets too easy

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.050 
effort you know it never gets too easy
because<00:01:22.500> when<00:01:22.890> it's<00:01:23.040> too<00:01:23.340> easy<00:01:23.640> and<00:01:24.030> too

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
because when it's too easy and too

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.780 
because when it's too easy and too
effortless<00:01:24.840> that<00:01:25.350> means<00:01:25.619> you're<00:01:26.250> actually

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
effortless that means you're actually

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.880 
effortless that means you're actually
not<00:01:26.970> trying<00:01:27.360> as<00:01:27.750> far<00:01:28.049> as<00:01:28.170> you<00:01:28.290> can<00:01:28.560> you're<00:01:28.860> not

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
not trying as far as you can you're not

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.950 
not trying as far as you can you're not
pushing<00:01:29.250> yourself<00:01:29.790> to<00:01:30.240> your<00:01:30.420> fullest

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
pushing yourself to your fullest

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.940 
pushing yourself to your fullest
potential<00:01:31.439> and<00:01:31.890> so<00:01:32.189> I<00:01:32.520> learned<00:01:33.240> that<00:01:33.710> to<00:01:34.710> grow

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
potential and so I learned that to grow

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.800 
potential and so I learned that to grow
you<00:01:35.400> always<00:01:35.880> got<00:01:36.030> to<00:01:36.060> be<00:01:36.180> pushing<00:01:36.390> yourself

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
you always got to be pushing yourself

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.170 
you always got to be pushing yourself
you<00:01:36.930> always<00:01:37.229> have<00:01:37.380> to<00:01:37.470> be<00:01:37.590> uncomfortable<00:01:38.180> the

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
you always have to be uncomfortable the

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.510 
you always have to be uncomfortable the
journey<00:01:39.420> is<00:01:39.540> never<00:01:39.689> gonna<00:01:39.930> get<00:01:40.170> easy<00:01:40.439> and<00:01:40.799> so

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
journey is never gonna get easy and so

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.590 
journey is never gonna get easy and so
that<00:01:42.060> was<00:01:42.390> a<00:01:42.869> very<00:01:43.470> you<00:01:44.040> know<00:01:44.270> powerful<00:01:45.270> lesson

that was a very you know powerful lesson

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.620 
that was a very you know powerful lesson
that<00:01:45.750> I<00:01:45.810> learned<00:01:45.840> because<00:01:47.149> you<00:01:48.149> always<00:01:48.329> got<00:01:48.600> to

that I learned because you always got to
put<00:01:48.810> in<00:01:48.899> effort<00:01:49.049> it's<00:01:49.860> never<00:01:50.130> gonna<00:01:50.280> be<00:01:50.490> a

breeze that journey is never gonna be
smooth<00:01:52.829> sailing<00:01:53.310> because<00:01:53.460> if<00:01:53.820> it<00:01:54.090> is<00:01:54.240> then

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
smooth sailing because if it is then

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.289 
smooth sailing because if it is then
that<00:01:54.720> means<00:01:54.930> you're<00:01:55.740> not<00:01:55.770> putting<00:01:56.219> out<00:01:56.610> as

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
that means you're not putting out as

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:58.160 
that means you're not putting out as
much<00:01:57.659> your

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
much your

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.530 
much your
trying<00:01:58.619> as<00:01:58.920> hard<00:01:58.979> as<00:01:59.610> you<00:01:59.759> should<00:01:59.820> be<00:02:00.180> the

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
trying as hard as you should be the

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.510 
trying as hard as you should be the
second<00:02:00.869> thing<00:02:01.080> is<00:02:01.409> kind<00:02:01.830> of<00:02:01.950> a<00:02:02.070> revelation

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
second thing is kind of a revelation

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.710 
second thing is kind of a revelation
that<00:02:02.880> I<00:02:02.909> had<00:02:03.210> around<00:02:03.570> the<00:02:03.720> 30<00:02:03.990> day<00:02:04.320> mark<00:02:04.740> I<00:02:05.720> was

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:06.720 
that I had around the 30 day mark I was

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:11.330 
that I had around the 30 day mark I was
holding<00:02:07.290> it<00:02:07.409> up<00:02:07.619> and<00:02:07.860> I<00:02:08.750> tried<00:02:09.750> to<00:02:09.959> actually<00:02:10.340> do

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
holding it up and I tried to actually do

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.600 
holding it up and I tried to actually do
better<00:02:11.580> and<00:02:12.000> push<00:02:12.540> my<00:02:12.780> arms<00:02:13.140> out<00:02:13.319> and<00:02:13.650> really

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
better and push my arms out and really

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.530 
better and push my arms out and really
use<00:02:15.000> my<00:02:15.239> muscles<00:02:15.450> to<00:02:16.110> push<00:02:16.980> and<00:02:17.430> be<00:02:17.700> strong<00:02:18.150> and

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
use my muscles to push and be strong and

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.050 
use my muscles to push and be strong and
I<00:02:18.900> realized<00:02:19.410> that<00:02:19.650> there<00:02:19.890> is<00:02:20.069> such<00:02:20.489> a<00:02:20.520> huge

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
I realized that there is such a huge

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.110 
I realized that there is such a huge
difference<00:02:21.480> between<00:02:21.840> being<00:02:22.080> active<00:02:22.770> being

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
difference between being active being

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.059 
difference between being active being
you<00:02:24.120> know<00:02:24.239> actively<00:02:24.900> pushing<00:02:25.260> your<00:02:25.590> arms<00:02:25.920> and

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069 
you know actively pushing your arms and

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:28.729 
you know actively pushing your arms and
using<00:02:26.459> your<00:02:26.580> muscles<00:02:26.970> versus<00:02:27.780> being<00:02:28.019> passive

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:28.739 
using your muscles versus being passive

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:31.699 
using your muscles versus being passive
and<00:02:29.150> passive<00:02:30.150> means<00:02:30.390> just<00:02:30.750> holding<00:02:31.230> your<00:02:31.350> arms

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
and passive means just holding your arms

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:35.059 
and passive means just holding your arms
up<00:02:31.890> but<00:02:32.430> not<00:02:32.640> like<00:02:32.910> you<00:02:33.360> know<00:02:33.510> engaging<00:02:34.319> so

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:35.069 
up but not like you know engaging so

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:36.860 
up but not like you know engaging so
when<00:02:35.220> you're<00:02:35.340> active<00:02:35.760> you're<00:02:36.120> actually<00:02:36.540> using

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
when you're active you're actually using

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:38.059 
when you're active you're actually using
these<00:02:36.989> muscles<00:02:37.260> and<00:02:37.650> you're<00:02:37.830> pushing

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:38.069 
these muscles and you're pushing

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:40.550 
these muscles and you're pushing
yourself<00:02:38.340> you<00:02:39.030> feel<00:02:39.180> so<00:02:39.600> much<00:02:39.780> stronger<00:02:40.290> that

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
yourself you feel so much stronger that

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.890 
yourself you feel so much stronger that
way<00:02:40.769> versus<00:02:41.340> when<00:02:41.489> you're<00:02:41.610> passive<00:02:42.150> you<00:02:42.690> feel

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
way versus when you're passive you feel

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.170 
way versus when you're passive you feel
like<00:02:43.049> you're<00:02:43.230> constantly<00:02:43.610> battling<00:02:44.610> gravity

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
like you're constantly battling gravity

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.449 
like you're constantly battling gravity
being<00:02:45.510> passive<00:02:46.110> holding<00:02:47.010> your<00:02:47.100> arms<00:02:47.340> up

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
being passive holding your arms up

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:49.880 
being passive holding your arms up
actually<00:02:47.880> hurts<00:02:48.120> a<00:02:48.209> lot<00:02:48.390> more<00:02:48.690> than<00:02:49.049> using

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
actually hurts a lot more than using

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:51.860 
actually hurts a lot more than using
your<00:02:50.010> muscles<00:02:50.370> and<00:02:50.610> flexing<00:02:51.390> and<00:02:51.569> you<00:02:51.750> know

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
your muscles and flexing and you know

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.620 
your muscles and flexing and you know
pushing<00:02:52.470> so<00:02:52.769> there<00:02:53.489> is<00:02:53.790> a<00:02:54.090> difference<00:02:54.540> between

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
pushing so there is a difference between

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:57.289 
pushing so there is a difference between
being<00:02:55.049> active<00:02:55.650> and<00:02:55.980> being<00:02:56.250> passive<00:02:56.519> being

00:02:57.289 --> 00:02:57.299 
being active and being passive being

00:02:57.299 --> 00:02:59.960 
being active and being passive being
active<00:02:57.810> you<00:02:58.110> feel<00:02:58.560> like<00:02:58.739> you<00:02:59.010> are<00:02:59.250> in<00:02:59.519> control

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
active you feel like you are in control

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.660 
active you feel like you are in control
of<00:03:00.360> your<00:03:00.750> body<00:03:01.019> and<00:03:01.200> how<00:03:01.560> you<00:03:01.799> feel<00:03:02.220> and<00:03:02.519> you

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
of your body and how you feel and you

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:05.840 
of your body and how you feel and you
feel<00:03:02.970> so<00:03:03.480> much<00:03:03.630> stronger<00:03:03.930> being<00:03:04.380> active<00:03:04.890> when

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:05.850 
feel so much stronger being active when

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:08.710 
feel so much stronger being active when
you're<00:03:06.000> passive<00:03:06.630> then<00:03:07.200> you're<00:03:08.040> literally

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:08.720 
you're passive then you're literally

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:11.270 
you're passive then you're literally
reacting<00:03:09.720> to<00:03:09.870> the<00:03:09.959> environment<00:03:10.590> you<00:03:10.859> feel<00:03:11.130> the

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
reacting to the environment you feel the

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:12.830 
reacting to the environment you feel the
gravity<00:03:11.459> pull<00:03:11.910> you<00:03:12.030> down<00:03:12.209> and<00:03:12.480> you're<00:03:12.570> trying

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
gravity pull you down and you're trying

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.500 
gravity pull you down and you're trying
to<00:03:12.900> hold<00:03:13.260> yourself<00:03:13.590> up<00:03:14.040> against<00:03:14.549> gravity<00:03:14.700> or

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
to hold yourself up against gravity or

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.740 
to hold yourself up against gravity or
your<00:03:16.079> environment<00:03:16.260> and<00:03:16.920> so<00:03:17.370> I<00:03:17.760> think<00:03:18.329> that<00:03:18.540> is

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
your environment and so I think that is

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:21.770 
your environment and so I think that is
such<00:03:18.989> a<00:03:19.019> key<00:03:19.859> difference<00:03:20.730> that<00:03:21.150> in<00:03:21.359> life<00:03:21.540> you

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
such a key difference that in life you

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.050 
such a key difference that in life you
got<00:03:21.959> to<00:03:22.109> be<00:03:22.230> active<00:03:22.829> and<00:03:23.070> when<00:03:23.519> you're<00:03:23.640> active

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
got to be active and when you're active

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.360 
got to be active and when you're active
you<00:03:24.480> are<00:03:24.630> in<00:03:24.750> control<00:03:25.079> and<00:03:25.170> you<00:03:25.590> feel<00:03:25.799> like<00:03:26.040> you

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
you are in control and you feel like you

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:28.130 
you are in control and you feel like you
own<00:03:26.579> it<00:03:26.609> and<00:03:27.000> you're<00:03:27.120> much<00:03:27.269> stronger<00:03:27.600> versus

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 
own it and you're much stronger versus

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:30.140 
own it and you're much stronger versus
when<00:03:28.620> you're<00:03:28.739> passive<00:03:29.280> you<00:03:29.459> let<00:03:29.730> your

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
when you're passive you let your

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:31.430 
when you're passive you let your
environment<00:03:30.329> pull<00:03:30.989> you<00:03:31.140> in<00:03:31.260> different

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
environment pull you in different

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.500 
environment pull you in different
directions<00:03:31.590> and<00:03:32.190> you<00:03:32.280> just<00:03:32.489> don't<00:03:32.910> feel<00:03:33.060> as

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
directions and you just don't feel as

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:38.650 
directions and you just don't feel as
powerful<00:03:34.350> that<00:03:34.950> way<00:03:35.250> so<00:03:35.540> be<00:03:36.540> active<00:03:37.489> push

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:38.660 
powerful that way so be active push

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:41.330 
powerful that way so be active push
alright<00:03:39.660> so<00:03:40.109> those<00:03:40.230> are<00:03:40.380> my<00:03:40.530> two<00:03:40.590> big<00:03:41.100> lessons

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
alright so those are my two big lessons

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:42.920 
alright so those are my two big lessons
from<00:03:41.819> doing<00:03:42.090> the<00:03:42.209> latter<00:03:42.450> half<00:03:42.720> of<00:03:42.810> this

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
from doing the latter half of this

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:45.380 
from doing the latter half of this
meditation<00:03:43.709> but<00:03:44.220> I<00:03:44.280> also<00:03:44.489> learned<00:03:44.850> a<00:03:45.120> lot<00:03:45.239> of

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.390 
meditation but I also learned a lot of

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:47.240 
meditation but I also learned a lot of
many<00:03:45.630> lessons<00:03:46.049> along<00:03:46.260> the<00:03:46.319> way<00:03:46.470> you<00:03:46.650> know<00:03:47.010> like

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
many lessons along the way you know like

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:48.860 
many lessons along the way you know like
if<00:03:47.579> you're<00:03:47.760> not<00:03:47.910> getting<00:03:48.150> stronger<00:03:48.480> you're

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
if you're not getting stronger you're

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:49.740 
if you're not getting stronger you're
getting<00:03:49.230> weaker

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:49.750 
getting weaker

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:52.260 
getting weaker
and<00:03:49.960> again<00:03:50.500> commitment<00:03:51.100> was<00:03:51.250> a<00:03:51.280> huge<00:03:51.880> lesson

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:52.270 
and again commitment was a huge lesson

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:54.240 
and again commitment was a huge lesson
throughout<00:03:52.780> this<00:03:52.900> entire<00:03:53.140> journey<00:03:53.830> you<00:03:54.130> know
