you know you get rain until you drop
early<00:04:06.759> and<00:04:07.030> I<00:04:07.209> think<00:04:08.159> that's<00:04:09.159> one<00:04:09.430> that<00:04:09.609> you

00:04:09.689 --> 00:04:09.699 
early and I think that's one that you

00:04:09.699 --> 00:04:12.089 
early and I think that's one that you
have<00:04:09.909> to<00:04:10.030> admire<00:04:10.299> with<00:04:10.599> boxes<00:04:10.989> and<00:04:11.229> you<00:04:11.409> know

00:04:12.089 --> 00:04:12.099 
have to admire with boxes and you know

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:14.219 
have to admire with boxes and you know
and<00:04:12.310> that<00:04:12.609> they're<00:04:12.879> going<00:04:13.060> in<00:04:13.269> and<00:04:13.479> the<00:04:13.659> the

00:04:14.219 --> 00:04:14.229 
and that they're going in and the the

00:04:14.229 --> 00:04:16.469 
and that they're going in and the the
fighting<00:04:14.590> against<00:04:14.859> to<00:04:15.009> the<00:04:15.129> men<00:04:15.310> and<00:04:15.340> you<00:04:16.329> know

00:04:16.469 --> 00:04:16.479 
fighting against to the men and you know

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:17.789 
fighting against to the men and you know
you<00:04:16.539> see<00:04:16.780> should<00:04:16.989> soon<00:04:17.229> and<00:04:17.380> take<00:04:17.530> some

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:17.799 
you see should soon and take some

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:20.069 
you see should soon and take some
punches<00:04:18.220> and<00:04:18.400> then<00:04:18.549> you<00:04:19.209> think<00:04:19.479> that<00:04:19.900> would<00:04:19.959> be

00:04:20.069 --> 00:04:20.079 
punches and then you think that would be

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:21.120 
punches and then you think that would be
slow<00:04:20.289> going<00:04:20.320> but<00:04:20.620> they're<00:04:20.829> still<00:04:20.889> going

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:21.130 
slow going but they're still going

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:23.040 
slow going but they're still going
forward<00:04:21.579> and<00:04:21.789> I<00:04:22.000> go<00:04:22.389> on<00:04:22.509> the<00:04:22.599> pitch<00:04:22.780> in<00:04:22.930> and

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:23.050 
forward and I go on the pitch in and

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:24.749 
forward and I go on the pitch in and
I'll<00:04:23.229> never<00:04:23.470> give<00:04:23.740> in<00:04:23.860> and<00:04:24.099> I<00:04:24.280> think<00:04:24.550> that's

00:04:24.749 --> 00:04:24.759 
I'll never give in and I think that's

00:04:24.759 --> 00:04:27.300
