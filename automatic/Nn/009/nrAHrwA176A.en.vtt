00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:42.440
 a game 0 15 and I show you today a basin series of the company my and 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.360
 though the eM the 18 years 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.830
 the race of the 80s is now the 8 Browns government's brand names 

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:51.090
 even difficult to recognize 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.090
 is in one he honorable 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:58.090
 Beautiful Mattersburg shine 

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:01.680
 the ceilings are of the sound character 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.810
 all very sharp and loud 

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:06.450
 So really very assertive when you rock 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.040
 Things do nice things 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.370
 There they are at home 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:14.140
 you can miss a steep for everyone but also for advanced clock 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:17.810
 People who want unfavorable SGO small basin time 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:20.870
 for brazen use 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:22.560
 it sound caterer stands 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.080
 I first of two parts 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.080
 As you can see it has a lot more giant big bell 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:31.830
 and of course I have only very warm and expressive 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:40.950
 So cool, especially with a little bit 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.990
 the block wants to work 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.760
 I'm going to fake a while 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:48.420
 a lot with the wide that Sams times in the overall structure can hear 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:42.309
 So I think just really right 

00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:44.009
 in years tone 

00:02:44.009 --> 00:02:47.009
 full warm things right 

00:02:47.679 --> 00:02:50.719
 come to talk to Heiko 

00:02:50.719 --> 00:02:54.079
 Wednesday 10 2 some packed 

00:02:54.079 --> 00:02:57.009
 also brilliant and spitzy from the sound 

00:02:57.009 --> 00:03:00.369
 the trick just amazed for example very much 

00:03:00.369 --> 00:03:02.909
 Warmbrunn comes and as strong 

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:05.669
 They are very, very nice to me 

00:03:05.669 --> 00:03:08.439
 really worth listening to the thing 

00:03:08.439 --> 00:03:11.829
 we speak the mixed Hecking played a bit more with the world 

00:03:28.999 --> 00:03:31.999
 there 

00:04:08.869 --> 00:04:13.209
 in the crash I really have all the standard sizes and 15 on the medium 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:16.719
 suspended on the medium of sixteen on the lower half of the 18th medium 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:22.049
 supposedly the 18er medium left because just nice deep and tight for 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:25.049
 Rocking stuff simply made for the left side 

00:04:26.059 --> 00:04:29.619
 the Comercio dear Finisher Cola one very much found many things to do 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:32.289
 stop by the smaller sizes 

00:04:32.289 --> 00:04:36.449
 It's simply the majority for this price at home 

00:04:37.719 --> 00:04:41.869
 Rocking things can do that is really very very good 

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:46.629
 which I find very nice for example Comercio one if you have two powers 

00:04:46.629 --> 00:04:47.860
 strikes together 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:51.210
 So Super AMOLED really fits it very very very well together 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:53.240
 coordinated the whole 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:55.840
 I stand the room still thinks Eck 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:59.490
 Mainly with the crash is and now they work that one time 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:00.330
 Tent is 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:03.330
 rather my course of course forfeit forget commitment 

00:05:04.289 --> 00:05:07.379
 again have a very very long and thus again a giant 

00:05:07.379 --> 00:05:08.409
 Sound volume 

00:05:08.409 --> 00:05:11.409
 after really fun 

00:06:11.449 --> 00:06:15.909
 So I think you heard it really very very good very very abstract 

00:06:15.909 --> 00:06:18.289
 strong really makes us keep having fun 

00:06:18.289 --> 00:06:20.619
 Kopper likes to pass us men 

00:06:20.619 --> 00:06:23.529
 Take a look at it and compare it with other pools in the world 

00:06:23.529 --> 00:06:26.529
 Price levels so you will really notice the weaknesses 

00:06:27.349 --> 00:06:29.689
 Mr. supposes broad masses 

00:06:29.689 --> 00:06:31.589
 yes of course an online order Frechen Songs 

00:06:31.589 --> 00:06:35.839
 assembled package consisting of 33 days back antique texts why 

00:06:35.839 --> 00:06:36.539
 Porsche 

00:06:36.539 --> 00:06:39.539
 I say goodbye and spider-man and leaves
