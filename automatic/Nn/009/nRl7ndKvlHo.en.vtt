interesting<00:03:17.769> thing<00:03:18.579> to<00:03:18.760> be<00:03:18.880> using<00:03:19.420> very

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
interesting thing to be using very

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.400 
interesting thing to be using very
unusual<00:03:20.440> to<00:03:20.560> be<00:03:20.680> using<00:03:21.070> that<00:03:21.750> in<00:03:22.750> a<00:03:22.930> sense<00:03:23.170> are

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:23.410 
unusual to be using that in a sense are

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:25.080 
unusual to be using that in a sense are
also<00:03:23.560> making<00:03:23.980> it<00:03:24.070> very<00:03:24.190> easy<00:03:24.519> because<00:03:24.820> we've

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.090 
also making it very easy because we've

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:27.210 
also making it very easy because we've
got<00:03:25.180> the<00:03:25.269> gelatine<00:03:25.720> in<00:03:25.989> them<00:03:26.200> and<00:03:26.410> so<00:03:26.980> let's

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:27.220 
got the gelatine in them and so let's

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:31.440 
got the gelatine in them and so let's
pop<00:03:27.400> them<00:03:27.579> onto<00:03:27.760> the<00:03:28.720> stove<00:03:28.989> to<00:03:29.349> cook<00:03:30.450> the
