the<00:03:58.550> fast<00:03:58.970> intense<00:03:59.240> doctor<00:03:59.660> shows<00:03:59.870> the<00:03:59.990> i<00:04:00.020> said

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:01.420 
the fast intense doctor shows the i said

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:03.610 
the fast intense doctor shows the i said
interior<00:04:02.420> lighting<00:04:02.840> I<00:04:03.230> didn't<00:04:03.500> like<00:04:03.590> that

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:03.620 
interior lighting I didn't like that

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:05.260 
interior lighting I didn't like that
they<00:04:03.920> don't<00:04:03.950> have<00:04:04.070> the<00:04:04.250> interior<00:04:04.730> lighting<00:04:04.940> to

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:05.270 
they don't have the interior lighting to

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:07.420 
they don't have the interior lighting to
it<00:04:05.450> so<00:04:06.020> but<00:04:06.350> i<00:04:06.380> guess<00:04:06.620> it<00:04:06.740> was<00:04:06.770> cheaper<00:04:07.190> for<00:04:07.340> him

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:07.430 
it so but i guess it was cheaper for him

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:09.580 
it so but i guess it was cheaper for him
to<00:04:07.520> make<00:04:07.640> and<00:04:08.120> once<00:04:08.750> again<00:04:08.810> if<00:04:09.020> you<00:04:09.110> close<00:04:09.380> the
