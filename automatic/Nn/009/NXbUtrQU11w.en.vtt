00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:02.340 
hey this is down boarding extreme we

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.599 
hey this is down boarding extreme we
just<00:00:02.550> have<00:00:02.850> made<00:00:03.090> some<00:00:03.300> home<00:00:03.620> made<00:00:04.620> rails<00:00:05.069> it's

00:00:05.599 --> 00:00:05.609 
just have made some home made rails it's

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:08.360 
just have made some home made rails it's
just<00:00:05.850> a<00:00:06.000> big<00:00:06.330> piece<00:00:06.540> of<00:00:06.569> wood<00:00:06.990> with<00:00:07.890> the<00:00:08.130> 2-inch

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
just a big piece of wood with the 2-inch

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:13.129 
just a big piece of wood with the 2-inch
pipe<00:00:08.760> that<00:00:09.059> was<00:00:09.090> used<00:00:09.990> from<00:00:10.170> a<00:00:10.349> bench<00:00:10.620> and<00:00:12.139> we

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
pipe that was used from a bench and we

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:14.660 
pipe that was used from a bench and we
found<00:00:13.410> that<00:00:13.590> having<00:00:13.920> an<00:00:14.099> angle<00:00:14.519> like<00:00:14.549> this

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
found that having an angle like this

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.910 
found that having an angle like this
isn't<00:00:15.089> working<00:00:15.750> because<00:00:15.929> we<00:00:16.379> try<00:00:16.590> and<00:00:16.650> slide

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
isn't working because we try and slide

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.460 
isn't working because we try and slide
it<00:00:16.949> the<00:00:17.490> wheel<00:00:17.670> catches<00:00:18.109> so<00:00:19.109> we've<00:00:19.260> made<00:00:19.289> a

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
it the wheel catches so we've made a

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.550 
it the wheel catches so we've made a
45-degree<00:00:20.460> cut<00:00:20.760> with<00:00:21.359> the<00:00:21.510> skill<00:00:21.840> saw<00:00:22.080> so

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
45-degree cut with the skill saw so

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.460 
45-degree cut with the skill saw so
those<00:00:22.859> will<00:00:23.039> not<00:00:23.730> catch<00:00:24.060> so<00:00:24.269> you<00:00:24.390> can<00:00:24.570> do<00:00:25.320> all

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
those will not catch so you can do all

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.250 
those will not catch so you can do all
your<00:00:25.830> grinds<00:00:26.900> everything<00:00:27.900> and<00:00:28.080> you<00:00:28.140> won't

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
your grinds everything and you won't

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.099 
your grinds everything and you won't
throw<00:00:28.500> her<00:00:28.590> about<00:00:28.769> the<00:00:28.920> wheel<00:00:29.070> catching<00:00:30.109> so

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
throw her about the wheel catching so

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:32.749 
throw her about the wheel catching so
and<00:00:31.590> then<00:00:31.830> after<00:00:32.130> that<00:00:32.250> we're<00:00:32.460> just<00:00:32.610> going<00:00:32.730> to

and then after that we're just going to

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.510 
and then after that we're just going to

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:45.389 

easy<00:00:42.340> to<00:00:42.550> lift<00:00:42.760> so<00:00:43.239> I'm<00:00:43.359> very<00:00:43.390> happy<00:00:44.399> on

easy to lift so I'm very happy on

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:48.869 
easy to lift so I'm very happy on
another<00:00:45.789> rail<00:00:46.030> it<00:00:46.329> has<00:00:46.510> little<00:00:46.829> handles<00:00:47.879> that

00:00:48.869 --> 00:00:48.879 
another rail it has little handles that

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:52.200 
another rail it has little handles that
makes<00:00:49.149> it<00:00:49.269> easy<00:00:49.510> to<00:00:49.660> pick<00:00:49.899> up<00:00:50.820> just<00:00:51.820> right<00:00:52.000> here

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:52.210 
makes it easy to pick up just right here

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:54.869 
makes it easy to pick up just right here
you<00:00:52.329> simply<00:00:53.199> get<00:00:53.829> little<00:00:54.129> handles<00:00:54.489> and<00:00:54.640> screw

00:00:54.869 --> 00:00:54.879 
you simply get little handles and screw

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:57.389 
you simply get little handles and screw
it<00:00:54.909> down<00:00:55.030> so<00:00:55.480> it's<00:00:55.600> easy<00:00:56.500> to<00:00:56.680> maneuver<00:00:57.219> and

00:00:57.389 --> 00:00:57.399 
it down so it's easy to maneuver and

00:00:57.399 --> 00:01:00.959 
it down so it's easy to maneuver and
this<00:00:57.940> one's<00:00:58.500> both<00:00:59.500> sides<00:01:00.190> are<00:01:00.370> done<00:01:00.579> so<00:01:00.879> you

00:01:00.959 --> 00:01:00.969 
this one's both sides are done so you

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:02.759 
this one's both sides are done so you
could<00:01:01.120> go<00:01:01.420> either<00:01:01.659> side<00:01:01.989> you<00:01:02.229> like<00:01:02.440> to<00:01:02.589> grind

00:01:02.759 --> 00:01:02.769 
could go either side you like to grind

00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:07.200 
could go either side you like to grind
on<00:01:03.269> and<00:01:04.269> yeah<00:01:04.479> they're<00:01:04.899> on<00:01:05.740> to<00:01:05.920> grind<00:01:06.159> just<00:01:07.000> do

whatever well yeah here's your homemade
rail<00:01:16.330> for<00:01:16.509> you<00:01:17.429> this<00:01:18.429> is<00:01:18.640> how<00:01:18.759> you<00:01:18.820> make<00:01:19.030> the<00:01:19.210> 45

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:19.630 
rail for you this is how you make the 45

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:38.580 
rail for you this is how you make the 45
degree<00:01:19.810> cut<00:01:20.289> on<00:01:20.560> your<00:01:20.619> homemade<00:01:21.550> reality<00:01:37.590> now

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:38.590 
degree cut on your homemade reality now

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:42.510 
degree cut on your homemade reality now
you<00:01:38.649> now<00:01:39.159> you<00:01:39.220> just<00:01:39.460> simply<00:01:39.729> a<00:01:41.009> chisel<00:01:42.009> off<00:01:42.190> all

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:42.520 
you now you just simply a chisel off all

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.440 
you now you just simply a chisel off all
the<00:01:42.670> leftover<00:01:44.039> let<00:01:45.039> the<00:01:45.190> skill<00:01:45.460> sliding<00:01:45.909> by

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:46.450 
the leftover let the skill sliding by

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:58.300 
the leftover let the skill sliding by
trying<00:01:46.690> to<00:01:46.810> get

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.310 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:00.800 

then<00:01:59.310> once<00:01:59.610> you're<00:01:59.820> all<00:01:59.940> done<00:01:59.970> with<00:02:00.240> getting

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
then once you're all done with getting

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.590 
then once you're all done with getting
all<00:02:00.870> that<00:02:01.050> done<00:02:01.460> the<00:02:02.460> finished<00:02:02.880> product<00:02:03.360> will

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
all that done the finished product will

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.620 
all that done the finished product will
look<00:02:03.660> like<00:02:03.810> and<00:02:04.740> I<00:02:05.580> wouldn't<00:02:05.910> do<00:02:06.090> this<00:02:06.270> alone

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
look like and I wouldn't do this alone

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.419 
look like and I wouldn't do this alone
it's<00:02:07.020> really<00:02:07.650> important<00:02:08.039> to<00:02:08.070> have<00:02:08.280> your

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
it's really important to have your

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.050 
it's really important to have your
parents<00:02:08.729> involved<00:02:09.690> or<00:02:10.080> adult<00:02:10.530> supervision

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
power tools that's really dangerous see

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.020 
power tools that's really dangerous see
I<00:02:15.630> have<00:02:15.840> my<00:02:16.020> father<00:02:16.590> making<00:02:17.580> this<00:02:17.670> right<00:02:17.910> now

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
I have my father making this right now

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.860 
I have my father making this right now
that's<00:02:18.270> Larry<00:02:19.100> so<00:02:20.100> he's<00:02:20.910> also<00:02:21.120> with<00:02:21.420> absolute

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
that's Larry so he's also with absolute

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.740 
that's Larry so he's also with absolute
electric<00:02:22.350> so<00:02:22.560> you<00:02:22.709> should<00:02:22.890> check<00:02:23.310> them<00:02:23.520> out

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
electric so you should check them out

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:46.400 
electric so you should check them out
well<00:02:24.750> that's<00:02:25.290> a<00:02:25.620> game<00:02:26.040> made<00:02:26.250> real<00:02:26.490> for<00:02:26.760> you
