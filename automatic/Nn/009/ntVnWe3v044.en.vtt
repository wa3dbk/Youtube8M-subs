00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:04.380
 the 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.170
 the fingers are looking too good 700 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.330
 and I would like to talk a little about the operation of the phone now 

00:00:10.989 --> 00:00:13.140
 profits the world sends big head 

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:14.239
 and 

00:00:14.239 --> 00:00:17.239
 "If you dedicate it here, then come here 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.890
 around the keys to reveal the hilt and train clothed and unlit 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.890
 State you can not see the buttons 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:29.529
 the governing only on light attach 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:34.790
 Daimler is a kind of Bernern sensor lower 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:36.370
 the heart if I am now 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:39.700
 No counting in a gravel bed Fini is not lit. 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:45.030
 but if I just tapped them now, they started to rule 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.000
 unfortunately it can happen too 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.520
 if you are just on the phone that you are provided against it and so that 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:57.550
 the iPhone turns into the Astor 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:02.190
 Judge good against armed and watch lists we have been phoned 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.070
 at a motion sensor the deadline should not be equipped at the moment 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.640
 Unfortunately, this is not the case with the mobile phone, which means you have to do a little bit 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:12.350
 watch out 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:15.350
 many diapers also this transition me so 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.130
 in the situation I'm down here really needs to be on the cash register after all 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:20.810
 occur and if I do then 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.509
 up here I just have to compete so this transition is 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:25.440
 something 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:27.700
 getting used to for many 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:29.980
 So it was a bit wet at our 

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:33.100
 Watch Nieminen 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.280
 then i have my part here with food jogging and i can do that too 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.600
 Two different types do it once 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.830
 there fell 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:46.659
 which is more comfortable but maybe not for the menu 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:52.070
 is suitable but I can just call a stupid and and press 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:53.420
 and to the side 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:55.770
 navigate through the menu and last 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.170
 because that's exactly what I do 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:00.310
 and let's see what I have everything for Minden KUB 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:05.009
 as he calls for totally call list then phone book music player internet 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:06.300
 news 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:09.829
 a data a calendar camera and Google 

00:02:09.829 --> 00:02:11.979
 Applications Alam 

00:02:11.979 --> 00:02:13.879
 and settings 

00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:16.829
 and I would have to initiate 1 messages 

00:02:16.829 --> 00:02:20.219
 because I also have the buttons down here a bit 

00:02:20.219 --> 00:02:23.219
 want to test 

00:02:29.759 --> 00:02:30.949
 so rest 

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:32.900
 Everything is very nice 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.799
 the counters, however 

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:38.839
 not as are around the buttons are so at a bit here from each other 

00:02:39.779 --> 00:02:43.369
 tired but unfortunately you do not really feel it with your hand 

00:02:44.669 --> 00:02:48.799
 I have to really look for that, I have completely quiet error free in 

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:49.919
 my text 

00:02:49.919 --> 00:02:53.409
 that can always be a positive sign 

00:02:53.409 --> 00:02:56.359
 what I also noticed your negative 

00:02:56.359 --> 00:02:58.869
 the power weakened down here 

00:02:58.869 --> 00:03:02.489
 the military service comes over Olver Fini tilts backwards if you do it with a 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:03.789
 Hand holds 

00:03:03.789 --> 00:03:07.729
 So in their defense far wrong is an amplification of the cell phone 

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:10.629
 relatively high up so that it tilted backwards 

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:13.629
 Hermanns holds with both hands then that is of course no problem 

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:17.829
 Hasemann that sits to the chest 

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:20.979
 how can overall good momentum Tecan 

00:03:20.979 --> 00:03:24.559
 if you really flip that switch between and then up here 

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:28.639
 only on crutches really market that everyone must of course for themselves 

00:03:28.639 --> 00:03:30.259
 decide 

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:31.999
 I find something to get used to
