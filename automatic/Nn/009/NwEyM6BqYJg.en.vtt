00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:11.610
 absurd is absurd ism there is no 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.260
 boat next to me I have got it all 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.699
 wise developed to the fullest and I am 

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:18.170
 pulling more planes at me than me at him 

00:00:14.699 --> 00:00:18.170
 and it is only to say inferior 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.380
 but pond of the planes to the water 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:33.680
 that happens sometimes is not logical and more 

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:36.610
 had somewhere going to see if 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.610
 I arrive to all of their places 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.950
 I'm going for the battleship that's here in 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.730
 g1 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:44.730
 And it is 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.110
 the pure torpedoes 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:01:01.440
 record recall and I have not seen them 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:01.440
 when I do not believe it 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:09.870
 I lose I lose not know me 

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:13.440
 does not matter 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:13.440
 how is the fuck 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:23.920
 9 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:28.710
 but my planes should arrive before 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.710
 that less aniquilen I hope you know 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.430
 good 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:57.140
 hello my friend is to eat torpedoes 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:02.830
 you're going to eat three at least who says 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:02.830
 316 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:10.590
 who says 3 says 6 that simple 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:23.420
 how it is put at the beginning 

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:27.550
 and that in 16 it also says that you're going to 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.550
 also eat these two people 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:31.109
 ah 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.030
 sorry 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:46.560
 poor with fifty and fifty three 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:48.830
 thousand 900 of the year so well it 's that easy 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.830
 easy 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:56.160
 now you can advance us 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.820
 today 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:04.680
 that amount there we are in saipan 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:09.800
 but I'm I'm re arming the planes 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:13.549
 I'm going to advance a little bit 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:23.970
 but I take advantage of them I will not bring them 

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:26.520
 still the fighters 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:28.590
 I'll wait for emptying first and 

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:31.980
 is 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:35.310
 there are times that it is better to fill them and 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:36.870
 although it is even though they have but 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:40.519
 yours are recharging or something like that is 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:40.519
 better to take advantage 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:46.320
 is that you should not have omaha 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:54.050
 when aircraft carrier already there but there is one 

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:57.220
 that at least they should not be left 

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:57.220
 sure, let's go 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:00.920
 so that it has not come down 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:06.360
 Now when I leave here I'm going to 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:06.360
 melt at 6 pam 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:15.050
 good a remover 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:18.640
 they know 

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:18.640
 and the moat I think that will take away 

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:34.030
 it's my turn 

00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:43.360
 in the distance 600 

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:55.260
 you are worth 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:57.150
 for a set of houses right now 

00:04:55.260 --> 00:05:01.020
 behind mine of mine that are 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:03.930
 good of you well well together behind 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:07.520
 if two come in fact if you attend the 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:07.520
 loads better than better 

00:05:08.569 --> 00:05:15.300
 to carry the attack but also 

00:05:12.099 --> 00:05:16.740
 when they come when they come 

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:19.560
 it seems to me that they have seen what is 

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:20.789
 approached and have said that nanai after the 

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:22.409
 battleship this one had in front is going to 

00:05:20.789 --> 00:05:24.650
 disappear now they begin to approach 

00:05:22.409 --> 00:05:24.650
 I think 

00:05:27.569 --> 00:05:31.460
 and now now it's going now 

00:05:34.129 --> 00:05:41.520
 jo jo jo jo jo jo jo lad 

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:41.520

00:05:44.669 --> 00:05:51.509
 it only makes thick strips of said one not 

00:05:47.199 --> 00:05:51.509
 you eat but five at least and hala 

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:02.000
 13 impacts for almost 4,000 years each 

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:04.480
 of the moment almost 60,000 is not bad 

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.480

00:06:09.009 --> 00:06:12.990

00:06:10.569 --> 00:06:12.990

00:06:19.529 --> 00:06:23.460
