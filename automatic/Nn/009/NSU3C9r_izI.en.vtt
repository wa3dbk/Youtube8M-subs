00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
a lot of people this is like I said this

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.270 
a lot of people this is like I said this
is<00:01:30.119> kind<00:01:30.479> of<00:01:30.540> a<00:01:30.689> trendy<00:01:31.619> thing<00:01:31.650> to<00:01:31.950> wear<00:01:32.070> these

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
is kind of a trendy thing to wear these

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.270 
is kind of a trendy thing to wear these
things<00:01:32.340> shorts<00:01:33.210> even<00:01:33.390> with<00:01:33.630> jeans<00:01:33.979> and<00:01:34.979> I

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
never really got it but I think the

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.499 
never really got it but I think the
reason<00:01:37.680> they<00:01:37.890> do<00:01:37.950> it<00:01:38.159> is<00:01:38.280> you<00:01:38.460> have<00:01:38.579> you<00:01:39.299> have<00:01:39.420> a
