why<00:02:07.520> it's<00:02:07.789> that<00:02:07.909> thick<00:02:08.390> I<00:02:08.660> really<00:02:09.020> don't<00:02:09.200> think

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:09.259 
why it's that thick I really don't think

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:11.080 
why it's that thick I really don't think
you<00:02:09.500> need<00:02:09.619> a<00:02:09.649> user<00:02:09.920> manual<00:02:10.160> that's<00:02:10.520> that<00:02:10.789> thick

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
you need a user manual that's that thick
