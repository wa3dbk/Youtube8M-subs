the snr when you use select fire on them

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.420 
the snr when you use select fire on them
now<00:01:44.670> have<00:01:44.970> reduced<00:01:45.479> damage<00:01:45.930> a<00:01:46.320> type<00:01:46.770> 25<00:01:47.189> is

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
the swat-556 which also has long range

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.660 
the swat-556 which also has long range
damage<00:01:57.719> increase<00:01:58.380> if<00:01:58.799> we<00:01:58.860> then<00:01:59.040> jump<00:01:59.310> over<00:01:59.460> to

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
damage increase if we then jump over to

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.950 
damage increase if we then jump over to
the<00:01:59.790> LMGs<00:02:00.360> both<00:02:00.840> a<00:02:01.049> hammer<00:02:01.380> and<00:02:01.680> a<00:02:02.040> qbb<00:02:02.850> LSW<00:02:02.960> now

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
have more damage at medium ranges so

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.540 
have more damage at medium ranges so
that's<00:02:06.540> all<00:02:06.810> the<00:02:07.049> basic<00:02:07.619> stuff<00:02:07.890> covered<00:02:08.250> we

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
that's all the basic stuff covered we

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:09.830 
that's all the basic stuff covered we
can<00:02:08.700> now<00:02:08.849> jump<00:02:09.149> into<00:02:09.330> actual<00:02:09.599> gameplay

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
can now jump into actual gameplay

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.690

footage<00:02:10.319> of<00:02:10.619> specific<00:02:11.310> gun<00:02:11.670> changes

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
footage of specific gun changes

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.730 
footage of specific gun changes
so<00:02:12.849> first<00:02:13.090> of<00:02:13.270> all<00:02:13.330> the<00:02:13.540> PDW<00:02:14.530> what<00:02:14.650> you're

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:14.740 
so first of all the PDW what you're

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:16.650 
so first of all the PDW what you're
gonna<00:02:14.830> see<00:02:15.010> on<00:02:15.130> screen<00:02:15.220> on<00:02:15.520> left<00:02:15.940> is<00:02:16.180> before

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
gonna see on screen on left is before

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:19.170 
gonna see on screen on left is before
pattern<00:02:17.200> on<00:02:17.290> the<00:02:17.440> right<00:02:17.650> is<00:02:17.950> after<00:02:18.489> patch<00:02:18.670> the

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
pattern on the right is after patch the

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.780 
pattern on the right is after patch the
PDW<00:02:19.989> is<00:02:20.140> now<00:02:20.319> slightly<00:02:20.920> less<00:02:21.099> accurate<00:02:21.580> while

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
PDW is now slightly less accurate while

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:23.880 
PDW is now slightly less accurate while
firing<00:02:22.300> from<00:02:22.480> the<00:02:22.540> hip<00:02:22.630> and<00:02:23.020> also<00:02:23.709> has

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
firing from the hip and also has

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:26.520 
firing from the hip and also has
increased<00:02:24.670> recoil<00:02:25.330> as<00:02:25.810> you<00:02:25.930> can<00:02:26.110> see<00:02:26.290> on<00:02:26.440> the

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
increased recoil as you can see on the

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:28.559 
increased recoil as you can see on the
right<00:02:26.680> the<00:02:26.890> recoil<00:02:27.250> of<00:02:27.280> the<00:02:27.340> PDW<00:02:27.880> almost<00:02:28.420> goes

00:02:28.559 --> 00:02:28.569 
right the recoil of the PDW almost goes

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:31.020 
right the recoil of the PDW almost goes
completely<00:02:28.840> off<00:02:29.440> the<00:02:30.190> actual<00:02:30.489> ship<00:02:30.819> on

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
completely off the actual ship on

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:32.699 
completely off the actual ship on
highjack<00:02:31.480> that<00:02:31.630> were<00:02:31.750> on<00:02:31.870> here<00:02:32.080> and<00:02:32.260> start

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:32.709 
highjack that were on here and start

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:34.440 
highjack that were on here and start
shooting<00:02:33.069> at<00:02:33.160> the<00:02:33.250> helicopter<00:02:33.850> in<00:02:33.940> some<00:02:34.150> cases

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
shooting at the helicopter in some cases

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:36.990 
shooting at the helicopter in some cases
so<00:02:34.690> the<00:02:34.780> PDW<00:02:35.500> Rico<00:02:35.980> has<00:02:36.370> definitely<00:02:36.880> been

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
so the PDW Rico has definitely been

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.600 
so the PDW Rico has definitely been
increased<00:02:37.420> more<00:02:37.959> so<00:02:37.989> in<00:02:38.470> an<00:02:38.620> upwards<00:02:39.130> and<00:02:39.310> to

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
increased more so in an upwards and to

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:42.000 
increased more so in an upwards and to
the<00:02:39.850> right<00:02:40.030> direction<00:02:40.540> now<00:02:41.319> the<00:02:41.410> next<00:02:41.680> gun<00:02:41.860> to

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
the right direction now the next gun to

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:44.160 
the right direction now the next gun to
be<00:02:42.130> changed<00:02:42.610> in<00:02:42.790> a<00:02:42.940> very<00:02:43.120> similar<00:02:43.480> way<00:02:43.660> is<00:02:43.989> the

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
be changed in a very similar way is the

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:46.470 
be changed in a very similar way is the
MSMC<00:02:44.830> of<00:02:45.190> course<00:02:45.430> another<00:02:45.640> submachine<00:02:46.300> gun

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
MSMC of course another submachine gun

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.120 
MSMC of course another submachine gun
which<00:02:46.600> is<00:02:46.720> also<00:02:47.200> now<00:02:47.410> less<00:02:47.650> accurate<00:02:48.040> when

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.130 
which is also now less accurate when

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:49.860 
which is also now less accurate when
you're<00:02:48.250> fine<00:02:48.459> from<00:02:48.670> the<00:02:48.790> hip<00:02:48.940> but<00:02:49.540> something

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
you're fine from the hip but something

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:51.870 
you're fine from the hip but something
I've<00:02:49.959> been<00:02:49.989> able<00:02:50.140> to<00:02:50.290> test<00:02:50.530> on<00:02:50.739> screen<00:02:51.310> is<00:02:51.519> the

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:51.880 
I've been able to test on screen is the

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:53.759 
I've been able to test on screen is the
actual<00:02:52.239> recoil<00:02:52.840> and<00:02:52.930> as<00:02:53.140> you<00:02:53.230> can<00:02:53.350> see<00:02:53.590> it's

00:02:53.759 --> 00:02:53.769 
actual recoil and as you can see it's

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:56.160 
actual recoil and as you can see it's
been<00:02:53.920> increased<00:02:54.340> more<00:02:54.580> of<00:02:54.760> a<00:02:54.880> vertical<00:02:55.630> manner

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 
been increased more of a vertical manner

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:58.680 
been increased more of a vertical manner
and<00:02:56.640> again<00:02:57.640> it's<00:02:57.850> almost<00:02:58.060> shooting<00:02:58.480> at<00:02:58.569> the

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:58.690 
and again it's almost shooting at the

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:00.990 
and again it's almost shooting at the
helicopter<00:02:58.840> it's<00:02:59.560> being<00:02:59.709> increased<00:03:00.190> so<00:03:00.790> much

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
helicopter it's being increased so much

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.920 
helicopter it's being increased so much
we've<00:03:01.239> got<00:03:01.360> to<00:03:01.450> remember<00:03:01.569> when<00:03:01.840> you're

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
won't be quite as predominant but it's

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:09.990 
won't be quite as predominant but it's
certainly<00:03:08.920> been<00:03:09.190> increased

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
certainly been increased

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.759

gun<00:03:17.920> so<00:03:18.100> they've<00:03:18.220> been<00:03:18.489> reduced<00:03:19.359> in<00:03:19.840> power<00:03:20.230> and

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:20.560 
gun so they've been reduced in power and

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.740
