going<00:01:12.229> to<00:01:12.320> be<00:01:12.380> faster<00:01:13.070> it's<00:01:13.340> going<00:01:13.370> to<00:01:13.520> be

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:13.580 
going to be faster it's going to be

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:15.100 
going to be faster it's going to be
faster<00:01:13.850> than<00:01:13.880> this<00:01:14.090> it's<00:01:14.270> going<00:01:14.360> to<00:01:14.479> 2.2<00:01:14.930> and

I<00:03:48.070> think<00:03:48.310> like<00:03:48.550> open<00:03:48.970> platform<00:03:49.480> may<00:03:50.170> be

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:50.230 
I think like open platform may be

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:52.640 
I think like open platform may be
interoperable<00:03:50.740> with<00:03:51.190> skype<00:03:51.670> as<00:03:51.850> well<00:03:52.030> and

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
interoperable with skype as well and

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:54.630 
interoperable with skype as well and
otherwise<00:03:53.650> there<00:03:53.920> will<00:03:53.980> be<00:03:54.130> other<00:03:54.280> skype

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:54.640 
otherwise there will be other skype

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:56.520 
otherwise there will be other skype
applications<00:03:55.240> of<00:03:55.420> course<00:03:55.600> they<00:03:55.720> work<00:03:55.960> they

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:56.530 
applications of course they work they

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:59.010 
applications of course they work they
made<00:03:56.650> a<00:03:56.680> special<00:03:57.100> system<00:03:57.310> monitor<00:03:57.940> so<00:03:58.750> you<00:03:58.840> can

00:03:59.010 --> 00:03:59.020 
made a special system monitor so you can

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:01.020 
made a special system monitor so you can
see<00:03:59.320> all<00:03:59.350> the<00:03:59.470> apps<00:04:00.010> that<00:04:00.430> are<00:04:00.550> running<00:04:00.580> right

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:03.030 
see all the apps that are running right
now<00:04:01.060> you<00:04:01.900> can<00:04:02.050> stop<00:04:02.350> all<00:04:02.530> the<00:04:02.620> apps<00:04:02.770> if<00:04:02.950> you

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:03.040 
now you can stop all the apps if you

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.010 
now you can stop all the apps if you
want<00:04:03.220> so<00:04:03.370> then<00:04:03.520> now<00:04:03.670> it's<00:04:03.820> even<00:04:04.300> smoother<00:04:04.870> and

into here that's fun maybe you should
hold<00:04:32.599> both<00:04:32.750> hands<00:04:32.990> it's<00:04:33.409> 480<00:04:33.800> grams<00:04:33.979> so<00:04:34.400> it's

00:04:34.659 --> 00:04:34.669 
hold both hands it's 480 grams so it's

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:37.149 
hold both hands it's 480 grams so it's
hold<00:04:35.030> about<00:04:35.180> in<00:04:35.300> one<00:04:35.419> hand<00:04:35.629> but<00:04:36.159> recommended
