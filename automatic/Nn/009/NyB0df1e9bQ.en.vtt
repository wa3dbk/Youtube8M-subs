seen I think this one that actually is a

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.370 
seen I think this one that actually is a
little<00:00:32.250> smaller<00:00:32.550> to<00:00:33.450> be<00:00:33.540> fair<00:00:33.719> this<00:00:33.840> has<00:00:34.020> 16

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
little smaller to be fair this has 16

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:35.600 
little smaller to be fair this has 16
gigabytes<00:00:34.739> that<00:00:34.860> I<00:00:34.920> had<00:00:35.040> a<00:00:35.070> little<00:00:35.190> more<00:00:35.430> but

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
gigabytes that I had a little more but

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.030 
gigabytes that I had a little more but
this<00:00:36.030> thing<00:00:36.239> is<00:00:36.390> tiny<00:00:36.840> 16<00:00:37.530> gigabytes<00:00:37.920> of

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
this thing is tiny 16 gigabytes of

moving<00:02:27.170> down<00:02:27.319> to<00:02:27.500> the<00:02:27.530> bottom<00:02:27.739> here<00:02:28.159> have<00:02:28.700> a

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
moving down to the bottom here have a

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:29.830 
moving down to the bottom here have a
look<00:02:28.939> at<00:02:29.030> this<00:02:29.180> there's<00:02:29.389> what<00:02:29.510> the<00:02:29.599> battery

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
look at this there's what the battery

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.649 
look at this there's what the battery
goes<00:02:30.109> right<00:02:30.980> there<00:02:31.189> that's<00:02:31.489> an<00:02:31.609> SD<00:02:32.120> card<00:02:32.389> slot

00:02:32.649 --> 00:02:32.659 
goes right there that's an SD card slot

00:02:32.659 --> 00:02:34.149 
goes right there that's an SD card slot
so<00:02:32.870> you<00:02:33.049> can<00:02:33.109> double<00:02:33.530> up<00:02:33.590> your<00:02:33.739> storage<00:02:34.069> if

00:02:34.149 --> 00:02:34.159 
so you can double up your storage if

00:02:34.159 --> 00:02:35.410 
so you can double up your storage if
you've<00:02:34.280> got<00:02:34.400> 16<00:02:34.790> gigabytes<00:02:35.150> of<00:02:35.239> internal

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
you've got 16 gigabytes of internal

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.259 
you've got 16 gigabytes of internal
storage<00:02:35.780> you<00:02:36.530> can<00:02:36.680> pick<00:02:36.799> up<00:02:36.920> an<00:02:37.040> SDHC<00:02:37.519> card<00:02:37.969> and

00:02:38.259 --> 00:02:38.269 
storage you can pick up an SDHC card and

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:40.360 
storage you can pick up an SDHC card and
they<00:02:38.450> come<00:02:38.629> in<00:02:38.750> 16<00:02:39.260> maybe<00:02:39.560> even<00:02:39.829> more<00:02:40.040> by<00:02:40.189> now

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
they come in 16 maybe even more by now

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:42.460 
they come in 16 maybe even more by now
and<00:02:40.700> you<00:02:41.510> can<00:02:41.629> put<00:02:41.750> that<00:02:41.840> in<00:02:42.019> there<00:02:42.139> as<00:02:42.230> well

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
and you can put that in there as well

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:44.289 
and you can put that in there as well
use<00:02:42.889> that<00:02:43.099> as<00:02:43.280> storage<00:02:43.549> so<00:02:43.700> you've<00:02:43.819> got<00:02:43.939> 16

00:02:44.289 --> 00:02:44.299 
use that as storage so you've got 16

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:45.940 
use that as storage so you've got 16
gigabytes<00:02:44.689> of<00:02:44.780> internal<00:02:44.959> storage<00:02:45.349> and<00:02:45.590> you

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
gigabytes of internal storage and you

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:47.379 
gigabytes of internal storage and you
can<00:02:46.069> have<00:02:46.220> you<00:02:46.519> know<00:02:46.549> a<00:02:46.790> gigabyte<00:02:47.209> to

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:47.389 
can have you know a gigabyte to

00:02:47.389 --> 00:02:49.149 
can have you know a gigabyte to
gigabytes<00:02:47.720> more<00:02:48.049> however<00:02:48.230> much<00:02:48.500> your<00:02:48.650> SD<00:02:48.919> card

00:02:49.149 --> 00:02:49.159 
gigabytes more however much your SD card

00:02:49.159 --> 00:02:51.490 
gigabytes more however much your SD card
is<00:02:49.310> you<00:02:49.819> can<00:02:49.970> add<00:02:50.150> all<00:02:50.510> that<00:02:50.689> this<00:02:51.260> has<00:02:51.470> a

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 
is you can add all that this has a

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.710 
is you can add all that this has a
canons<00:02:52.010> digit<00:02:52.340> 2<00:02:52.549> image<00:02:52.879> processor<00:02:53.389> and<00:02:53.599> the

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 
canons digit 2 image processor and the

canons digit 2 image processor and the
Canon<00:02:54.319> lenses<00:02:54.650> as<00:02:54.799> well<00:02:55.040> now<00:02:55.549> with<00:02:55.700> the

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
Canon lenses as well now with the

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:57.699 
Canon lenses as well now with the
digital<00:02:55.939> 2<00:02:56.480> processors<00:02:57.019> you<00:02:57.079> get<00:02:57.230> less<00:02:57.439> noise

00:02:57.699 --> 00:02:57.709 
digital 2 processors you get less noise

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:00.909 
digital 2 processors you get less noise
better<00:02:58.549> low-light<00:02:58.969> performance<00:02:59.000> and<00:02:59.689> I<00:03:00.500> just

00:03:00.909 --> 00:03:00.919 
better low-light performance and I just

00:03:00.919 --> 00:03:02.199 
better low-light performance and I just
can't<00:03:01.040> get<00:03:01.099> over<00:03:01.189> how<00:03:01.310> small<00:03:01.790> this<00:03:01.909> thing<00:03:01.969> is
