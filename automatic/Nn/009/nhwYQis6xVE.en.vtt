because<00:02:12.010> I<00:02:12.130> I<00:02:12.400> don't<00:02:12.700> think<00:02:12.880> I've<00:02:12.940> ever<00:02:12.970> used<00:02:13.330> a

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
because I I don't think I've ever used a

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.330 
because I I don't think I've ever used a
little<00:02:13.660> piggy<00:02:13.990> before<00:02:14.290> and<00:02:14.440> I<00:02:14.530> felt<00:02:14.740> I<00:02:15.010> felt

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
little piggy before and I felt I felt

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.160 
little piggy before and I felt I felt
bad<00:02:15.520> for<00:02:15.790> it<00:02:15.910> so<00:02:16.090> I<00:02:16.150> put<00:02:16.360> it<00:02:16.450> there<00:02:16.630> and<00:02:16.960> also

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
bad for it so I put it there and also

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.020 
bad for it so I put it there and also
it's<00:02:17.380> adorable<00:02:17.650> so<00:02:17.980> that<00:02:18.580> that's<00:02:18.820> another

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
it's adorable so that that's another

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:20.760 
it's adorable so that that's another
good<00:02:19.240> reason<00:02:19.450> but<00:02:19.840> it<00:02:20.170> needed<00:02:20.470> something

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:20.770 
good reason but it needed something

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:23.280 
good reason but it needed something
something<00:02:21.760> gardeny<00:02:22.510> I<00:02:22.540> guess<00:02:22.750> that's<00:02:22.960> kind<00:02:23.050> of

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
something gardeny I guess that's kind of

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.260 
something gardeny I guess that's kind of
garden<00:02:23.620> near<00:02:23.740> Pig<00:02:24.010> do<00:02:24.400> people<00:02:24.640> put<00:02:24.820> pigs<00:02:25.060> in

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:25.270 
garden near Pig do people put pigs in

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
was gonna say that is not correct but

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.800

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.080 
tables as well now I know that's kind of

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.320 
tables as well now I know that's kind of
like<00:02:47.260> odd<00:02:47.500> like<00:02:48.310> I<00:02:48.340> don't<00:02:48.640> personally<00:02:48.940> think

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:49.330 
like odd like I don't personally think

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:52.470 
like odd like I don't personally think
I've<00:02:49.630> ever<00:02:49.780> seen<00:02:50.050> drugs<00:02:50.430> outside<00:02:51.430> not<00:02:52.210> Walt

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
I've ever seen drugs outside not Walt

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.390 
I've ever seen drugs outside not Walt
like<00:02:52.660> maybe<00:02:53.470> one<00:02:53.620> like<00:02:53.740> a<00:02:53.800> deck<00:02:54.100> or<00:02:54.310> a<00:02:54.340> patio

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
like maybe one like a deck or a patio

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.340 
like maybe one like a deck or a patio
but<00:02:54.880> I<00:02:54.940> don't<00:02:55.120> know<00:02:55.210> about<00:02:55.390> the<00:02:55.480> grass<00:02:55.660> but<00:02:55.960> it

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:56.350 
but I don't know about the grass but it

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:57.750 
but I don't know about the grass but it
just<00:02:56.590> needed<00:02:56.830> a<00:02:57.010> little<00:02:57.250> extra<00:02:57.370> something

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
just needed a little extra something

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.310 
just needed a little extra something
it's<00:02:58.030> probably<00:02:58.150> because<00:02:58.630> I<00:02:58.750> wasn't<00:02:58.960> able<00:02:59.170> to

00:02:59.310 --> 00:02:59.320 
it's probably because I wasn't able to

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:02.940 
it's probably because I wasn't able to
like<00:02:59.650> paint<00:02:59.950> the<00:03:00.190> terrain<00:03:00.670> then<00:03:01.590> it's<00:03:02.590> okay<00:03:02.800> I

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950 
like paint the terrain then it's okay I

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:04.530 
like paint the terrain then it's okay I
think<00:03:03.160> it<00:03:03.400> looks<00:03:03.550> ok<00:03:03.880> if<00:03:04.000> you<00:03:04.090> want<00:03:04.270> to<00:03:04.330> remove

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
think it looks ok if you want to remove

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:06.000 
think it looks ok if you want to remove
them<00:03:04.720> that's<00:03:04.930> totally<00:03:05.440> fine<00:03:05.620> I<00:03:05.920> would
