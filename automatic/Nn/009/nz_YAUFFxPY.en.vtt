reason<00:01:42.010> I<00:01:42.130> originally<00:01:42.910> looked<00:01:43.210> into<00:01:43.510> the

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:43.600 
reason I originally looked into the

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:44.850 
reason I originally looked into the
sprocket<00:01:44.050> is<00:01:44.140> because<00:01:44.290> I'm<00:01:44.410> part<00:01:44.590> of<00:01:44.650> the<00:01:44.740> new

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:44.860 
sprocket is because I'm part of the new

to 300 forums and I saw some people

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:48.390 
to 300 forums and I saw some people
talking<00:01:46.690> about<00:01:46.870> it<00:01:47.140> saying<00:01:48.070> that<00:01:48.160> it

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:48.400 
talking about it saying that it

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.730 
talking about it saying that it
increases<00:01:48.760> highway<00:01:49.360> performance<00:01:49.740> it

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:50.740 
increases highway performance it

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.550 
increases highway performance it
increases<00:01:51.250> fuel<00:01:51.430> economy<00:01:52.170> and<00:01:53.170> it<00:01:53.230> increases

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.560 
increases fuel economy and it increases

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.590 
increases fuel economy and it increases
the<00:01:53.980> the<00:01:54.010> bikes<00:01:54.550> basically<00:01:55.060> performance<00:01:55.510> in

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:55.600 
the the bikes basically performance in

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.960 
the the bikes basically performance in
first<00:01:55.810> gear<00:01:55.960> because<00:01:56.200> and<00:01:56.560> then<00:01:56.979> just<00:01:57.160> 300

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:57.970 
first gear because and then just 300

first gear because and then just 300
very<00:01:58.330> very<00:01:58.630> short<00:01:59.020> first<00:01:59.350> gear<00:02:01.260> so<00:02:02.260> that

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:03.160 
very very short first gear so that

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:05.580 
very very short first gear so that
obviously<00:02:03.970> piqued<00:02:04.510> my<00:02:04.600> interest<00:02:04.690> being<00:02:05.350> that

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.590 
obviously piqued my interest being that

big<00:02:26.680> of<00:02:26.739> an<00:02:26.890> investment<00:02:27.239> worst<00:02:28.239> case<00:02:28.450> I<00:02:28.570> don't

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
big of an investment worst case I don't

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:30.690 
big of an investment worst case I don't
like<00:02:28.780> it<00:02:29.019> I'll<00:02:29.110> pull<00:02:29.290> it<00:02:29.320> out<00:02:29.530> and<00:02:29.709> about<00:02:30.370> 20

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
like it I'll pull it out and about 20

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.170 
like it I'll pull it out and about 20
bucks<00:02:31.170> so<00:02:32.170> it<00:02:32.230> took<00:02:32.380> me<00:02:32.440> about<00:02:33.040> an<00:02:33.340> hour<00:02:33.430> to<00:02:33.820> put

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
bucks so it took me about an hour to put

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.030 
bucks so it took me about an hour to put
it<00:02:34.269> in<00:02:34.420> I<00:02:34.600> had<00:02:35.200> never<00:02:35.380> done<00:02:35.620> anything<00:02:35.890> like

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
it in I had never done anything like

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.650 
it in I had never done anything like
that<00:02:36.190> before<00:02:36.340> this<00:02:36.790> is<00:02:36.880> my<00:02:37.000> first<00:02:37.239> bike<00:02:37.480> I've

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.660 
that before this is my first bike I've

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:39.479 
that before this is my first bike I've
never<00:02:37.840> worked<00:02:38.050> on<00:02:38.200> a<00:02:38.260> motorcycle<00:02:38.860> before<00:02:38.950> so

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:39.489 
never worked on a motorcycle before so

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:42.300 
never worked on a motorcycle before so
and<00:02:39.910> I<00:02:40.030> was<00:02:40.150> able<00:02:40.360> to<00:02:40.390> figure<00:02:40.690> it<00:02:40.810> out<00:02:40.930> I<00:02:41.920> said<00:02:42.280> I

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
and I was able to figure it out I said I

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:43.800 
and I was able to figure it out I said I
would<00:02:42.459> say<00:02:42.580> the<00:02:42.700> hardest<00:02:42.820> part<00:02:43.209> was<00:02:43.360> getting

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
would say the hardest part was getting

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:47.430 
would say the hardest part was getting
the<00:02:44.820> the<00:02:45.820> original<00:02:46.030> sprocket<00:02:46.630> off<00:02:46.810> I<00:02:47.200> had<00:02:47.320> to

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 
the the original sprocket off I had to

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.590 
the the original sprocket off I had to
pick<00:02:47.560> up<00:02:47.709> a<00:02:47.830> 28<00:02:48.310> millimeter<00:02:48.459> socket<00:02:49.209> to<00:02:49.360> get<00:02:49.510> it

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:49.600 
pick up a 28 millimeter socket to get it

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:53.520 
pick up a 28 millimeter socket to get it
off<00:02:49.750> and<00:02:50.019> I<00:02:50.380> used<00:02:50.560> my<00:02:50.650> impact<00:02:51.190> wrench<00:02:52.530> to

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
off and I used my impact wrench to

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:55.680 
off and I used my impact wrench to
remove<00:02:53.560> it<00:02:54.010> but<00:02:54.160> once<00:02:54.370> that<00:02:54.519> came<00:02:55.120> off<00:02:55.360> it<00:02:55.570> was

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
remove it but once that came off it was

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:57.960 
remove it but once that came off it was
it<00:02:56.500> was<00:02:56.620> smooth<00:02:56.860> sailing<00:02:56.890> I<00:02:57.400> was<00:02:57.580> able<00:02:57.670> to<00:02:57.790> use

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:57.970 
it was smooth sailing I was able to use

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:00.800 
it was smooth sailing I was able to use
stock<00:02:58.330> chain<00:02:58.890> obviously<00:02:59.890> you<00:02:59.980> have<00:03:00.160> to

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
stock chain obviously you have to

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.270 
stock chain obviously you have to
readjust<00:03:01.810> the<00:03:02.170> chain<00:03:02.410> slack<00:03:02.680> afterwards

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 
readjust the chain slack afterwards

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.550 
readjust the chain slack afterwards
realign<00:03:03.730> the<00:03:03.880> rear<00:03:04.060> tire<00:03:04.360> but<00:03:05.230> that's<00:03:05.410> just

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
realign the rear tire but that's just

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:06.810 
realign the rear tire but that's just
general<00:03:05.980> maintenance<00:03:06.130> that<00:03:06.519> you<00:03:06.580> should

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:06.820 
general maintenance that you should

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:09.630 
general maintenance that you should
technically<00:03:07.180> be<00:03:07.269> doing<00:03:07.570> regardless<00:03:08.019> so<00:03:08.640> that

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:09.640 
technically be doing regardless so that

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:15.270 
technically be doing regardless so that
wasn't<00:03:09.850> a<00:03:10.030> huge<00:03:10.239> concern<00:03:10.600> so<00:03:12.930> after<00:03:13.930> a<00:03:14.410> total

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280 
wasn't a huge concern so after a total

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:16.740 
wasn't a huge concern so after a total
investment<00:03:15.850> of<00:03:15.910> let's<00:03:16.120> say<00:03:16.269> twenty<00:03:16.600> two

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:16.750 
investment of let's say twenty two

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:20.970 
investment of let's say twenty two
dollars<00:03:16.900> an<00:03:17.860> hour<00:03:18.100> of<00:03:18.370> my<00:03:18.519> time<00:03:18.810> I<00:03:19.810> took<00:03:20.739> it<00:03:20.890> for

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:20.980 
dollars an hour of my time I took it for

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:22.590 
dollars an hour of my time I took it for
a<00:03:21.070> test<00:03:21.310> ride<00:03:21.430> and<00:03:21.790> right<00:03:22.030> off<00:03:22.209> the<00:03:22.239> bat<00:03:22.420> I

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:22.600 
a test ride and right off the bat I

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.270 
a test ride and right off the bat I
noticed<00:03:23.019> a<00:03:23.110> change<00:03:23.140> in<00:03:23.500> first<00:03:23.769> gear<00:03:23.980> first

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280 
noticed a change in first gear first

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:26.180 
noticed a change in first gear first
gear<00:03:24.430> was<00:03:24.640> much<00:03:25.239> taller<00:03:25.600> than<00:03:25.720> it<00:03:25.959> was

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
gear was much taller than it was

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:30.150 
gear was much taller than it was
originally<00:03:27.299> so<00:03:28.299> you<00:03:28.690> no<00:03:28.870> longer<00:03:29.049> have<00:03:29.920> to

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:30.160 
originally so you no longer have to

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.270 
originally so you no longer have to
shift<00:03:30.400> going<00:03:31.180> through<00:03:31.450> the<00:03:31.600> intersection<00:03:32.290> you

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 
shift going through the intersection you

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:34.800 
shift going through the intersection you
don't<00:03:33.459> have<00:03:33.670> to<00:03:33.880> shift<00:03:34.060> all<00:03:34.269> the<00:03:34.299> time<00:03:34.570> when

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:34.810 
don't have to shift all the time when

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:35.960 
don't have to shift all the time when
doing

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
doing

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:38.070 
doing
bumper-to-bumper<00:03:36.970> traffic<00:03:37.480> I<00:03:37.810> mean<00:03:37.930> you

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:38.080 
bumper-to-bumper traffic I mean you

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:40.500 
bumper-to-bumper traffic I mean you
still<00:03:38.290> I<00:03:38.560> still<00:03:39.010> do<00:03:39.430> sometimes<00:03:39.760> but<00:03:40.120> you<00:03:40.300> don't

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.510 
still I still do sometimes but you don't

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:43.470 
still I still do sometimes but you don't
really<00:03:40.750> have<00:03:41.020> to<00:03:41.940> so<00:03:42.940> it's<00:03:43.090> much<00:03:43.240> more

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.480 
really have to so it's much more

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:44.850 
really have to so it's much more
convenient<00:03:43.840> if<00:03:44.050> it<00:03:44.200> feels<00:03:44.410> like<00:03:44.590> the<00:03:44.710> bike

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:44.860 
convenient if it feels like the bike

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:47.940 
convenient if it feels like the bike
shouldn't<00:03:45.220> come<00:03:45.370> this<00:03:45.520> way<00:03:45.670> stock<00:03:46.650> on<00:03:47.650> the

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:47.950 
shouldn't come this way stock on the

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:50.550 
shouldn't come this way stock on the
highway<00:03:48.310> I<00:03:48.520> mean<00:03:48.790> in<00:03:49.060> sixth<00:03:49.540> gear<00:03:49.750> yeah<00:03:50.050> rpms

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 
highway I mean in sixth gear yeah rpms

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:51.870 
highway I mean in sixth gear yeah rpms
have<00:03:50.680> dropped<00:03:50.950> significantly<00:03:51.100> I'd<00:03:51.670> probably

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:51.880 
have dropped significantly I'd probably

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:53.790 
have dropped significantly I'd probably
say<00:03:52.150> in<00:03:52.270> around<00:03:52.510> that<00:03:52.630> the<00:03:52.720> range<00:03:52.870> of<00:03:53.050> six<00:03:53.260> to

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:53.800 
say in around that the range of six to

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:57.300 
say in around that the range of six to
seven<00:03:54.160> hundred<00:03:54.900> which<00:03:55.900> is<00:03:55.930> awesome<00:03:56.530> in<00:03:57.070> terms

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.310 
seven hundred which is awesome in terms

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:59.130 
seven hundred which is awesome in terms
of<00:03:57.430> fuel<00:03:57.610> economy<00:03:57.850> I<00:03:58.090> haven't<00:03:58.480> actually

00:03:59.130 --> 00:03:59.140 
of fuel economy I haven't actually

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:01.200 
of fuel economy I haven't actually
burned<00:03:59.350> through<00:03:59.560> a<00:03:59.620> full<00:03:59.830> tank<00:04:00.070> yet<00:04:00.370> I'm<00:04:00.880> sure

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:01.210 
burned through a full tank yet I'm sure

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:04.380 
burned through a full tank yet I'm sure
it<00:04:01.300> will<00:04:01.420> help<00:04:01.690> because<00:04:01.840> with<00:04:02.440> decreased<00:04:03.390> rpms

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:04.390 
it will help because with decreased rpms

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:07.320 
it will help because with decreased rpms
comes<00:04:04.660> increased<00:04:04.990> fuel<00:04:05.440> economy<00:04:06.030> but<00:04:07.030> as<00:04:07.180> soon

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:07.330 
comes increased fuel economy but as soon

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:09.810 
comes increased fuel economy but as soon
as<00:04:07.420> I<00:04:07.480> go<00:04:07.600> through<00:04:07.810> this<00:04:07.900> tank<00:04:08.200> I<00:04:08.890> will<00:04:09.490> post<00:04:09.670> in

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:09.820 
as I go through this tank I will post in

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:11.220 
as I go through this tank I will post in
the<00:04:09.880> video<00:04:10.090> description<00:04:10.210> or<00:04:10.810> I'll<00:04:10.960> make<00:04:11.080> an

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:19.289 
of changes it did there in terms of
acceleration<00:04:17.109> yeah<00:04:17.380> I<00:04:17.470> definitely<00:04:18.120> well<00:04:19.120> I

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:19.299 
acceleration yeah I definitely well I

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:20.970 
acceleration yeah I definitely well I
wouldn't<00:04:19.570> say<00:04:19.630> definitely<00:04:19.900> I'm<00:04:20.350> sure<00:04:20.650> it<00:04:20.799> did

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:20.980 
wouldn't say definitely I'm sure it did

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:23.430 
wouldn't say definitely I'm sure it did
affect<00:04:21.760> acceleration<00:04:22.360> a<00:04:22.420> little<00:04:22.780> bit<00:04:22.930> my

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:23.440 
affect acceleration a little bit my

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:25.050 
affect acceleration a little bit my
bikes<00:04:23.650> not<00:04:23.860> accelerating<00:04:24.430> like<00:04:24.550> he<00:04:24.640> did<00:04:24.850> out

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:25.060 
bikes not accelerating like he did out

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:27.600 
bikes not accelerating like he did out
of<00:04:25.270> the<00:04:25.930> factory<00:04:26.380> some<00:04:27.010> of<00:04:27.100> that<00:04:27.220> probably<00:04:27.490> has

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:27.610 
of the factory some of that probably has

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:29.280 
of the factory some of that probably has
to<00:04:27.700> be<00:04:27.790> with<00:04:27.910> rockets<00:04:28.450> so<00:04:28.600> it<00:04:28.840> probably<00:04:28.960> has<00:04:29.170> to

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:29.290 
to be with rockets so it probably has to

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:32.540 
to be with rockets so it probably has to
do<00:04:29.350> with<00:04:29.440> a<00:04:29.530> slip<00:04:29.740> on<00:04:30.120> either<00:04:31.120> way<00:04:31.390> it's<00:04:32.110> still

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:32.550 
do with a slip on either way it's still

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:34.830 
do with a slip on either way it's still
very<00:04:33.550> very<00:04:33.670> functional<00:04:34.420> it'll<00:04:34.660> still

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:34.840 
very very functional it'll still

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:37.800 
very very functional it'll still
accelerate<00:04:35.320> past<00:04:35.470> most<00:04:35.770> cars<00:04:36.420> you<00:04:37.420> know<00:04:37.540> so

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:37.810 
accelerate past most cars you know so

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:41.070 
accelerate past most cars you know so
for<00:04:38.500> all<00:04:38.650> practical<00:04:38.730> reasons<00:04:39.730> there's<00:04:40.210> as<00:04:40.900> far

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:41.080 
for all practical reasons there's as far

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:42.390 
for all practical reasons there's as far
as<00:04:41.200> I'm<00:04:41.260> going<00:04:41.380> soon<00:04:41.560> there's<00:04:41.740> no<00:04:41.860> reason<00:04:42.250> not

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:42.400 
as I'm going soon there's no reason not

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:47.430 
as I'm going soon there's no reason not
to<00:04:42.460> do<00:04:42.669> this<00:04:42.700> upgrade<00:04:43.800> and<00:04:45.540> to<00:04:46.540> me<00:04:46.690> the<00:04:47.080> the

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:47.440 
to do this upgrade and to me the the

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:50.520 
to do this upgrade and to me the the
benefits<00:04:47.890> or<00:04:48.880> the<00:04:48.940> pros<00:04:49.330> far<00:04:50.080> outweigh<00:04:50.380> the

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:50.530 
benefits or the pros far outweigh the

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:53.159 
benefits or the pros far outweigh the
cons<00:04:50.970> so<00:04:51.970> if<00:04:52.090> you're<00:04:52.210> considering<00:04:52.600> doing<00:04:52.720> it

00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:53.169 
cons so if you're considering doing it

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:55.140 
cons so if you're considering doing it
if<00:04:53.380> you<00:04:53.500> have<00:04:53.680> a<00:04:53.710> lower<00:04:54.370> displacement<00:04:54.970> bike

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:55.150 
if you have a lower displacement bike

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:57.990 
if you have a lower displacement bike
and<00:04:55.630> you<00:04:55.840> know<00:04:55.930> a<00:04:55.960> 250<00:04:56.620> is<00:04:56.770> 300<00:04:57.250> perhaps<00:04:57.669> even<00:04:57.850> a

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:58.000 
and you know a 250 is 300 perhaps even a

and you know a 250 is 300 perhaps even a
500<00:04:58.570> I<00:04:58.750> definitely<00:04:59.470> recommend<00:04:59.770> it<00:05:00.040> I'll<00:05:00.190> post

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:00.490 
500 I definitely recommend it I'll post

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:02.460 
500 I definitely recommend it I'll post
the<00:05:00.700> actual<00:05:01.030> model<00:05:01.720> number<00:05:01.930> of<00:05:02.020> the<00:05:02.080> sprocket

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:02.470 
the actual model number of the sprocket

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:05.550 
the actual model number of the sprocket
I<00:05:02.530> got<00:05:03.060> in<00:05:04.060> the<00:05:04.540> video<00:05:04.780> description<00:05:05.020> as<00:05:05.380> well

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:05.560 
I got in the video description as well

I got in the video description as well
as<00:05:05.650> an<00:05:05.740> annotation<00:05:06.160> just<00:05:06.640> because<00:05:07.000> I<00:05:07.930> saw

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:08.350 
as an annotation just because I saw

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:10.080 
as an annotation just because I saw
people<00:05:08.380> reading<00:05:08.950> on<00:05:09.220> forums<00:05:09.669> I<00:05:09.760> saw<00:05:09.910> people

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:10.090 
people reading on forums I saw people

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:11.730 
people reading on forums I saw people
writing<00:05:10.480> that<00:05:10.630> there's<00:05:10.870> basically<00:05:11.470> two

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:11.740 
writing that there's basically two

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:13.630 
different models that people get one is

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:16.620 
different models that people get one is
a<00:05:13.660> perfect<00:05:14.560> fit<00:05:14.800> one<00:05:15.040> is<00:05:15.160> not<00:05:15.419> the<00:05:16.419> one<00:05:16.540> I've
