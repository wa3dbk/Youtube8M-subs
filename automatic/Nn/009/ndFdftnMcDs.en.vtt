here is one of the dual SIM card so it's

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.960 
here is one of the dual SIM card so it's
the<00:01:43.229> normal<00:01:43.560> you<00:01:43.950> can<00:01:43.979> pop<00:01:44.280> that<00:01:44.399> out<00:01:44.460> it's<00:01:44.850> the

Mini I believe you need them you need
the<00:02:05.430> Nano<00:02:05.880> size<00:02:06.509> which<00:02:06.899> is<00:02:07.020> the<00:02:07.140> tiny<00:02:07.429> just

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
the Nano size which is the tiny just

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.929 
the Nano size which is the tiny just
like<00:02:08.610> the<00:02:08.729> circuit<00:02:09.090> board<00:02:09.270> really<00:02:09.629> there

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:10.939 
like the circuit board really there

00:02:10.939 --> 00:02:13.420 
like the circuit board really there
so<00:02:11.560> still<00:02:12.560> have<00:02:12.739> a<00:02:12.769> look<00:02:12.920> at<00:02:13.040> the<00:02:13.099> link<00:02:13.250> below

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
so still have a look at the link below

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:15.699 
so still have a look at the link below
this<00:02:13.730> video<00:02:13.939> and<00:02:14.420> we<00:02:15.349> would<00:02:15.439> be<00:02:15.500> able<00:02:15.590> to

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:15.709 
this video and we would be able to

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:18.869 
this video and we would be able to
select<00:02:16.060> iPhone<00:02:17.060> 5<00:02:17.390> to<00:02:17.689> get<00:02:17.900> the<00:02:18.049> nano-sim

00:02:18.869 --> 00:02:18.879 
select iPhone 5 to get the nano-sim

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:22.270 
select iPhone 5 to get the nano-sim
there<00:02:19.879> and<00:02:20.379> that's<00:02:21.379> it<00:02:21.500> really<00:02:21.650> just<00:02:21.950> get<00:02:22.129> that

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
there and that's it really just get that

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.330
