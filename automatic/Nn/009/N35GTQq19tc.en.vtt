by<00:00:45.930> the<00:00:45.989> heat<00:00:46.260> I<00:00:46.469> think<00:00:46.739> they<00:00:46.829> finally<00:00:47.190> have<00:00:47.340> a

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
by the heat I think they finally have a

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.130 
by the heat I think they finally have a
formula<00:00:47.820> as<00:00:48.059> to<00:00:48.210> how<00:00:48.329> to<00:00:48.390> defend<00:00:48.780> them<00:00:48.960> and<00:00:49.020> it

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
formula as to how to defend them and it

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.319 
formula as to how to defend them and it
showed<00:00:49.379> really<00:00:49.649> well<00:00:49.920> in<00:00:50.129> game<00:00:50.789> number<00:00:50.969> two

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
showed really well in game number two

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.119 
showed really well in game number two
and<00:00:51.570> really<00:00:52.020> the<00:00:52.170> heat<00:00:52.320> really<00:00:52.649> choked<00:00:52.920> out

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
and really the heat really choked out

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:54.770

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
especially as that least they're number

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.179 
especially as that least they're number
one<00:01:36.329> and<00:01:36.600> number<00:01:36.630> two<00:01:36.900> score<00:01:37.229> the<00:01:37.680> Pacers

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
one and number two score the Pacers

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:39.710 
one and number two score the Pacers
really<00:01:38.430> have<00:01:38.579> no<00:01:38.729> shot<00:01:39.030> to<00:01:39.060> win<00:01:39.210> this<00:01:39.479> series

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
really have no shot to win this series

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.120 
really have no shot to win this series
or<00:01:39.930> this<00:01:40.140> game<00:01:40.350> here<00:01:40.560> in<00:01:40.650> Game<00:01:40.799> three<00:01:40.829> and

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
or this game here in Game three and

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.469 
or this game here in Game three and
that's<00:01:41.250> why<00:01:41.369> I<00:01:41.400> think<00:01:41.640> the<00:01:41.729> heat<00:01:41.880> at<00:01:42.030> minus<00:01:42.270> six

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
that's why I think the heat at minus six

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:43.700 
that's why I think the heat at minus six
and<00:01:42.600> a<00:01:42.630> half<00:01:42.659> despite<00:01:43.079> the<00:01:43.259> spread<00:01:43.470> being<00:01:43.649> a

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
and a half despite the spread being a

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.050 
and a half despite the spread being a
little<00:01:43.860> bit<00:01:44.009> high<00:01:44.159> I<00:01:44.430> think<00:01:44.820> they<00:01:44.909> have<00:01:45.030> a

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
little bit high I think they have a

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.969 
little bit high I think they have a
little<00:01:45.299> bit<00:01:45.420> of<00:01:45.450> value<00:01:45.840> here<00:01:46.020> also<00:01:46.860> another

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
little bit of value here also another

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.499 
little bit of value here also another
factor<00:01:47.100> for<00:01:47.579> this<00:01:47.670> game<00:01:47.850> was<00:01:48.030> the<00:01:48.060> Birdman

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
factor for this game was the Birdman

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.600 
factor for this game was the Birdman
Chris<00:01:48.689> Andersen<00:01:49.140> was<00:01:49.229> huge<00:01:49.530> for<00:01:50.009> the<00:01:50.159> ESPN

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
Chris Andersen was huge for the ESPN

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.969 
Chris Andersen was huge for the ESPN

game patients were only three and 12 so

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.760 
game patients were only three and 12 so

he really had a defensive impact on this

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.130 
he really had a defensive impact on this
on<00:02:04.950> the<00:02:05.040> Pacers<00:02:05.399> gave<00:02:06.240> them<00:02:06.390> some<00:02:06.600> size<00:02:06.840> the

Indiana<00:02:14.530> Pacers<00:02:14.620> if<00:02:15.069> you<00:02:15.159> include<00:02:15.870> this<00:02:16.870> Pope

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
Indiana Pacers if you include this Pope

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:18.420 
Indiana Pacers if you include this Pope
for<00:02:17.290> the<00:02:17.470> second<00:02:17.799> postseason<00:02:18.040> game<00:02:18.400> first

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
for the second postseason game first

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:19.949 
for the second postseason game first
postseason<00:02:18.819> game<00:02:19.269> excuse<00:02:19.629> me<00:02:19.750> and<00:02:19.840> they've

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:19.959 
postseason game excuse me and they've

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:21.360 
postseason game excuse me and they've
also<00:02:20.110> covered<00:02:20.500> three<00:02:20.739> of<00:02:20.829> their<00:02:20.950> last<00:02:20.980> four

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
also covered three of their last four

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.729 
also covered three of their last four
games<00:02:21.400> against<00:02:22.120> the<00:02:22.209> Pacers<00:02:22.599> in<00:02:22.750> Miami<00:02:23.530> so<00:02:23.709> I

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:23.739 
games against the Pacers in Miami so I

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:25.229 
games against the Pacers in Miami so I
do<00:02:23.860> think<00:02:24.069> that<00:02:24.189> the<00:02:24.400> Miami<00:02:24.909> Heat<00:02:25.060> have<00:02:25.209> a

00:02:25.229 --> 00:02:25.239 
do think that the Miami Heat have a

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:26.970 
do think that the Miami Heat have a
little<00:02:25.480> bit<00:02:25.659> of<00:02:25.689> value<00:02:25.989> done<00:02:26.140> I'm<00:02:26.260> like<00:02:26.439> I<00:02:26.769> said

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
little bit of value done I'm like I said

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:28.649 
little bit of value done I'm like I said
Paul<00:02:27.159> George's<00:02:27.489> is<00:02:27.670> being<00:02:27.879> absolutely<00:02:28.299> taken

00:02:28.649 --> 00:02:28.659 
Paul George's is being absolutely taken

00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:30.119 
Paul George's is being absolutely taken
out<00:02:28.900> by<00:02:29.049> LeBron<00:02:29.379> James<00:02:29.650> and<00:02:29.739> if<00:02:29.860> that's<00:02:30.010> the

00:02:30.119 --> 00:02:30.129 
out by LeBron James and if that's the

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:31.589 
out by LeBron James and if that's the
case<00:02:30.220> of<00:02:30.489> Game<00:02:30.640> three<00:02:30.670> don't<00:02:31.390> think<00:02:31.540> the

00:02:31.589 --> 00:02:31.599 
case of Game three don't think the

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:32.940 
case of Game three don't think the
Pacers<00:02:31.900> have<00:02:32.049> much<00:02:32.170> of<00:02:32.200> a<00:02:32.379> chance<00:02:32.560> here<00:02:32.829> either

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
Pacers have much of a chance here either

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:34.979 
Pacers have much of a chance here either
so<00:02:33.069> if<00:02:33.280> that<00:02:33.400> continues<00:02:33.579> I<00:02:34.000> like<00:02:34.450> the<00:02:34.599> heat

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:34.989 
so if that continues I like the heat

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:36.360 
so if that continues I like the heat
here<00:02:35.140> at<00:02:35.200> mine<00:02:35.319> six<00:02:35.620> and<00:02:35.739> a<00:02:35.769> half<00:02:35.799> so<00:02:36.069> add<00:02:36.190> it<00:02:36.280> to

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
here at mine six and a half so add it to

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:38.100 
here at mine six and a half so add it to
