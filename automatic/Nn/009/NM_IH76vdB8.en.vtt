00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:07.109
 new video to show you how 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:08.490
 fill a second violent aulas we're going 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:10.019
 to leave on something a little more 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.599
 original with fimo paste to 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.250
 inside I do not really know what 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:18.090
 I am embarking there when I 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.470
 talk we'll see well in the end but I 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.910
 still want to film you this because 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.240
 that it remains I will not do 45 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:27.599
 minutes like this guy there I'll go 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:32.940
 say and 2.3 material materials by the 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:35.160
 material that I need so I think of 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.320
 eyes a flask tower could even river 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.180
 it's still not bad of all that 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.879
 is thought that makes ground I you 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:45.210
 would put I think the tubes list of 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:48.170
 material materials at info base 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.170
 so let's go 

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:56.719
 2 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.890
 born 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:29.650
 is there for the light 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:31.870
 artificial I'm a little obliged if we 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:33.490
 play nothing at all then once 

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:37.120
 you did read like that that my 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:39.270
 wife is shown in fast and good 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:42.130
 making small mushrooms 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:47.140
 so yes it's true toddlers 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:49.350
 really like that then how do we 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:52.270
 will do we will already take the pass 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:54.160
 each dark could very well take 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:56.229
 the Sahara dough or dough 

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:59.770
 champagne does not have flesh I believe 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:03.430
 that it is that exists and we will do 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:05.050
 really microbes or like this then 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:07.360
 I take the dough ice 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:12.250
 and in classic 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:17.620
 also i'm going too a little ball and 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:19.780
 I pay for it, I press gently 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.420
 always keep there the bomb shape having 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:28.260
 does I form a little ball two 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:28.260
 dear buddies and here's a little mushroom 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:36.500
 see nothing crazy then you actually 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:37.880
 as much as you want the color that 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:41.680
 you want to do a little bit your 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:41.680
 imagination comes out of it all 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:58.609
 so I hope we have one led to 

00:02:55.519 --> 00:03:00.620
 one there ie I made small 

00:02:58.609 --> 00:03:02.769
 mushrooms on the grass is cooked 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:06.920
 meantime I did that so these are 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:09.379
 four little snails 3 really all 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:11.269
 small and one bigger then I'm going to you 

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:14.269
 show how I made them which I 

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:16.760
 I 'll show you a veil 

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:22.849
 so why are they like that it's 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:25.909
 because I have polishes so I 

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:28.760
 took the dough on easy I took one 

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:32.799
 little bit like that I formed a 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:37.750
 ball then I rolled like this 

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:37.750
 just these worlds next to wholesale 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:49.019
 then I trained I flatten your head 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:51.510
 while keeping the rounded shape at 

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:55.590
 start because it's going to be his head and 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:58.250
 then with another page and form a 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.250
 flange 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:07.459
 I did not even take two to show 

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:11.209
 I have not in hell of a choir and I have 

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:11.209
 rolled like this 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:21.919
 a big fat that's it I went from the top 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:26.139
 and I rolled around enlarging the 

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:30.850
 wholesale diameter of the five major a little 

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:33.259
 and then we will do the editing 

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:35.650
 so I can use a strong glue 

00:04:33.259 --> 00:04:35.650
 or 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:17.280
 and 

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:17.280
 hamon 

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:23.600
 m 

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:23.600
 at M 

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:30.010
 and 

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:30.010
 hamon 

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:33.720
 and 

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:39.580
 no
