units that I have down inside and each

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.610 
units that I have down inside and each
of<00:00:51.300> these<00:00:51.360> are<00:00:51.540> controlled<00:00:51.899> by<00:00:51.989> a<00:00:52.079> switch<00:00:52.410> now

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
of these are controlled by a switch now

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.110 
of these are controlled by a switch now
I<00:00:52.649> have<00:00:52.890> not<00:00:53.040> figured<00:00:53.309> out<00:00:53.520> a<00:00:53.579> way<00:00:53.790> yet<00:00:54.000> to

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
I have not figured out a way yet to

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.990 
I have not figured out a way yet to
control<00:00:54.450> these<00:00:54.600> by<00:00:54.809> one<00:00:55.170> switch<00:00:55.590> so<00:00:56.489> for<00:00:56.910> right

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
control these by one switch so for right

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.250 
control these by one switch so for right
now<00:00:57.059> this<00:00:57.210> is<00:00:57.540> how<00:00:57.690> it's<00:00:57.840> going<00:00:57.960> to<00:00:58.020> have<00:00:58.230> to

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
now this is how it's going to have to

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.350 
now this is how it's going to have to
work<00:00:58.590> until<00:00:59.190> I<00:00:59.399> get<00:00:59.550> it<00:00:59.670> working<00:01:00.000> but<00:01:00.149> if<00:01:00.270> you

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:00.360 
work until I get it working but if you

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.080 
work until I get it working but if you
look<00:01:00.510> up<00:01:00.660> in<00:01:00.750> here<00:01:00.989> i<00:01:01.020> also<00:01:01.320> have<00:01:01.760> lights<00:01:02.760> in

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
the walls we're going to turn those on

the walls we're going to turn those on
to<00:01:06.960> show<00:01:07.710> you<00:01:07.770> those<00:01:07.979> are<00:01:08.130> all<00:01:08.189> controlled<00:01:08.579> by

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
to show you those are all controlled by

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.940 
to show you those are all controlled by
a<00:01:08.790> switch<00:01:09.439> so<00:01:10.439> what<00:01:10.530> I'm<00:01:10.590> gonna<00:01:10.679> do<00:01:10.799> is<00:01:10.829> I'm

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
a switch so what I'm gonna do is I'm

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.669 
a switch so what I'm gonna do is I'm
going<00:01:11.069> to<00:01:11.159> knock<00:01:11.459> these<00:01:11.670> torches<00:01:12.030> out<00:01:12.679> it's

00:01:13.669 --> 00:01:13.679 
going to knock these torches out it's

00:01:13.679 --> 00:01:17.859 
going to knock these torches out it's
like<00:01:13.829> so<00:01:16.009> then<00:01:17.009> I'm<00:01:17.189> going<00:01:17.340> to<00:01:17.399> turn<00:01:17.549> these<00:01:17.759> on

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:17.869 
like so then I'm going to turn these on

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:27.669 
like so then I'm going to turn these on
one<00:01:18.869> by<00:01:19.079> one<00:01:19.579> let's<00:01:20.579> see<00:01:20.909> and<00:01:21.450> there's<00:01:22.439> one<00:01:24.139> two

00:01:38.989 --> 00:01:38.999 
pulsers in there now these are kind of a

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:41.510 
pulsers in there now these are kind of a
variation<00:01:39.689> of<00:01:39.779> rapid<00:01:40.139> pulsers<00:01:40.560> I<00:01:40.740> just<00:01:41.340> kind

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
variation of rapid pulsers I just kind

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.510 
variation of rapid pulsers I just kind
of<00:01:41.579> added<00:01:42.569> some<00:01:42.749> more<00:01:42.869> stuff<00:01:43.200> to<00:01:43.469> it<00:01:43.619> and<00:01:43.799> add

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
of added some more stuff to it and add

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.580 
of added some more stuff to it and add
some<00:01:44.880> give<00:01:45.539> it<00:01:45.659> some<00:01:45.840> more<00:01:45.869> blinking<00:01:46.380> lights

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
some give it some more blinking lights

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.379 
some give it some more blinking lights
and<00:01:46.920> I'll<00:01:47.039> go<00:01:47.609> down<00:01:47.759> there<00:01:47.939> and<00:01:47.969> show<00:01:48.209> you<00:01:48.270> how

00:01:48.379 --> 00:01:48.389 
and I'll go down there and show you how

00:01:48.389 --> 00:01:52.099 
and I'll go down there and show you how
they're<00:01:48.659> built<00:01:50.179> but<00:01:51.179> that's<00:01:51.389> what<00:01:51.749> that<00:01:51.899> looks

00:01:52.099 --> 00:01:52.109 
they're built but that's what that looks

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:53.719 
they're built but that's what that looks
like<00:01:52.229> so<00:01:52.560> now<00:01:52.679> let's<00:01:52.919> go<00:01:53.069> turn<00:01:53.279> on<00:01:53.310> the<00:01:53.520> wall

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
like so now let's go turn on the wall

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
coming here I got a switch here and that

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:07.610 
coming here I got a switch here and that
switch<00:01:58.979> on<00:01:59.420> there's<00:02:00.420> more<00:02:00.510> lies

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:07.620

so<00:02:08.620> now<00:02:08.770> as<00:02:08.920> this<00:02:09.100> goes

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:17.680 

where

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:25.300 

this<00:02:18.690> is<00:02:18.870> the<00:02:19.020> wiring<00:02:19.470> for<00:02:19.650> the<00:02:19.680> wall<00:02:19.920> lights

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:30.020 

see<00:02:27.110> I've<00:02:28.110> got<00:02:28.170> boosters<00:02:28.770> so<00:02:29.460> to<00:02:29.520> extend<00:02:29.940> the

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
see I've got boosters so to extend the

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:44.300 
see I've got boosters so to extend the
power<00:02:30.500> from<00:02:31.500> every<00:02:31.800> 15<00:02:32.160> blocks

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.590 

kind<00:02:45.310> of<00:02:45.370> slow<00:02:45.580> down<00:02:45.760> a<00:02:45.790> little<00:02:45.970> bit<00:02:46.150> some<00:02:46.420> get

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:46.600 
kind of slow down a little bit some get

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.030 
kind of slow down a little bit some get
an<00:02:46.690> idea<00:02:46.960> of<00:02:47.020> how<00:02:47.230> it<00:02:47.260> in<00:02:47.470> if<00:02:47.620> you<00:02:47.740> look<00:02:47.890> right

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
an idea of how it in if you look right

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:53.460 
an idea of how it in if you look right
here<00:02:48.630> there's<00:02:49.630> where<00:02:49.810> the<00:02:49.840> lights<00:02:50.080> are<00:02:52.470> patch

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
here there's where the lights are patch

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:57.960 
here there's where the lights are patch
that<00:02:53.800> back<00:02:54.070> up<00:02:55.920> coming<00:02:56.920> back<00:02:57.100> here<00:02:57.430> we<00:02:57.610> got<00:02:57.760> the

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:57.970 
that back up coming back here we got the

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:02.640 
that back up coming back here we got the
five<00:02:58.570> clock<00:02:58.840> pulse<00:02:59.110> ER<00:03:01.170> and<00:03:02.170> then<00:03:02.320> it's<00:03:02.470> hook

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
five clock pulse ER and then it's hook

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:06.450 
five clock pulse ER and then it's hook
right<00:03:03.160> here<00:03:03.610> to<00:03:04.240> the<00:03:04.360> switch<00:03:04.630> and<00:03:04.960> so<00:03:05.620> break

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:06.460 
right here to the switch and so break

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:08.790 
right here to the switch and so break
this<00:03:06.610> out<00:03:06.910> see<00:03:07.840> the<00:03:07.960> switch<00:03:08.200> is<00:03:08.380> there<00:03:08.620> if<00:03:08.710> i

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:08.800 
this out see the switch is there if i

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.810 
this out see the switch is there if i
turn<00:03:08.860> the<00:03:09.070> switch<00:03:09.190> off<00:03:09.780> the<00:03:10.780> lights<00:03:10.990> go<00:03:11.230> off

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:11.820 
turn the switch off the lights go off

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:15.390 
turn the switch off the lights go off
swatch<00:03:13.080> say<00:03:14.080> that<00:03:14.350> there's<00:03:14.770> the<00:03:14.980> lights<00:03:15.160> off

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400 
swatch say that there's the lights off

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:22.800 
swatch say that there's the lights off
turn<00:03:17.940> it<00:03:18.940> back<00:03:19.000> on<00:03:19.150> and<00:03:21.450> the<00:03:22.450> lights<00:03:22.660> are

turn it back on and the lights are
blinking<00:03:22.990> again<00:03:24.510> that's<00:03:25.510> that<00:03:25.810> part<00:03:26.110> now

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:26.440 
blinking again that's that part now

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:29.270 
blinking again that's that part now
we're<00:03:27.010> going<00:03:27.100> to<00:03:27.190> go<00:03:27.400> to<00:03:27.640> the<00:03:28.330> bottom<00:03:28.540> floor

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
we're going to go to the bottom floor

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:34.470 
we're going to go to the bottom floor
and<00:03:30.280> show<00:03:30.520> you<00:03:30.610> the<00:03:30.730> rapid<00:03:31.030> pulsers<00:03:32.550> cool<00:03:33.550> all

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480 
and show you the rapid pulsers cool all

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:39.170 
and show you the rapid pulsers cool all
right<00:03:34.750> let's<00:03:35.020> light<00:03:35.230> this<00:03:35.440> up<00:03:35.620> some<00:03:35.950> down<00:03:36.160> here

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.730 

you<00:03:40.180> can<00:03:40.300> see<00:03:40.480> this<00:03:40.630> is<00:03:40.840> basically<00:03:41.230> the<00:03:41.410> rabbit

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:41.740 
you can see this is basically the rabbit

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:43.980 
you can see this is basically the rabbit
pulsers<00:03:42.160> and<00:03:43.150> how<00:03:43.210> their<00:03:43.420> work<00:03:43.600> they're

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:43.990 
pulsers and how their work they're

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:46.979 
pulsers and how their work they're
hooking<00:03:44.350> to<00:03:44.620> the<00:03:44.739> switches<00:03:45.190> up<00:03:45.520> there<00:03:45.989> we're

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:46.989 
hooking to the switches up there we're

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:48.360 
hooking to the switches up there we're
going<00:03:47.110> to<00:03:47.170> go<00:03:47.230> inside<00:03:47.620> of<00:03:47.650> here<00:03:47.950> this<00:03:48.130> will<00:03:48.250> be

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:48.370 
going to go inside of here this will be

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:52.020 
going to go inside of here this will be
a<00:03:48.400> little<00:03:48.520> noisy<00:03:50.250> this<00:03:51.250> is<00:03:51.430> what<00:03:51.580> the<00:03:51.700> rabbit

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.030 
a little noisy this is what the rabbit

00:03:52.030 --> 00:04:08.340 
a little noisy this is what the rabbit
pulsar's<00:03:52.420> look<00:03:52.630> like

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:08.350 

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:10.170 

each<00:04:08.920> one<00:04:09.160> of<00:04:09.190> these<00:04:09.340> are<00:04:09.520> hooked<00:04:09.670> to<00:04:09.790> a<00:04:09.820> switch

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:10.180 
each one of these are hooked to a switch

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:17.360 
each one of these are hooked to a switch
as<00:04:10.510> they<00:04:10.780> go<00:04:11.170> in<00:04:11.290> the<00:04:11.410> hair

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:20.729 

so<00:04:18.370> basically<00:04:18.789> I<00:04:18.940> mean<00:04:19.209> that's<00:04:19.560> it's<00:04:20.560> really

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:20.739 
so basically I mean that's it's really

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:22.350 
so basically I mean that's it's really
about<00:04:20.889> that<00:04:21.280> it's<00:04:21.489> about<00:04:21.579> it<00:04:21.880> I<00:04:21.910> just<00:04:22.030> wanted
