the<00:01:30.370> problem<00:01:30.760> is<00:01:30.910> if<00:01:31.840> money<00:01:32.230> is<00:01:32.470> not<00:01:32.740> a<00:01:32.770> store

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:33.280 
the problem is if money is not a store

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.060 
the problem is if money is not a store
of<00:01:33.310> stable<00:01:34.030> value<00:01:34.180> over<00:01:34.630> time<00:01:34.740> then<00:01:35.740> there<00:01:35.950> is

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:36.070 
of stable value over time then there is

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:38.790 
of stable value over time then there is
no<00:01:36.310> incentive<00:01:36.730> to<00:01:37.000> save<00:01:37.390> money<00:01:37.630> why<00:01:38.470> save

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:38.800 
no incentive to save money why save

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:41.370 
no incentive to save money why save
money<00:01:39.130> if<00:01:39.670> it<00:01:39.820> is<00:01:39.940> going<00:01:40.180> to<00:01:40.330> be<00:01:40.360> worth<00:01:40.690> less<00:01:41.080> in

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:41.380 
money if it is going to be worth less in

money if it is going to be worth less in
the<00:01:41.500> future<00:01:41.920> than<00:01:42.460> it<00:01:42.640> is<00:01:42.820> right<00:01:42.850> now

the future than it is right now

the future than it is right now
this<00:01:45.990> causes<00:01:46.500> speculation<00:01:47.399> to<00:01:47.579> become<00:01:47.880> common

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
this causes speculation to become common
