00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
about to leave he kind of just stared

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.890 
about to leave he kind of just stared
off<00:01:22.560> into<00:01:22.619> space<00:01:23.189> and<00:01:23.490> then<00:01:24.000> slammed<00:01:24.420> his<00:01:24.689> head

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
off into space and then slammed his head

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.080 
off into space and then slammed his head
really<00:01:25.290> hard<00:01:25.680> against<00:01:26.100> the<00:01:26.310> desk<00:01:26.549> which<00:01:26.850> kind

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
really hard against the desk which kind

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.149 
really hard against the desk which kind
of<00:01:27.150> threw<00:01:27.360> me<00:01:27.390> off<00:01:27.509> wasn't<00:01:28.020> expecting<00:01:28.650> that<00:01:28.740> I

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
of threw me off wasn't expecting that I

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.620 
of threw me off wasn't expecting that I
guess<00:01:29.340> that's<00:01:29.579> what<00:01:29.759> exams<00:01:30.060> do<00:01:30.360> to<00:01:30.479> you

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
guess that's what exams do to you

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.420 
guess that's what exams do to you
especially<00:01:31.290> if<00:01:31.409> you're<00:01:31.590> in<00:01:31.710> a<00:01:31.799> math<00:01:32.009> oriented

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
especially if you're in a math oriented

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.580 
especially if you're in a math oriented
program<00:01:33.180> so<00:01:33.600> I<00:01:33.630> tried<00:01:33.930> to<00:01:33.960> be<00:01:34.140> really<00:01:34.320> sneaky

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
program so I tried to be really sneaky

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.280 
program so I tried to be really sneaky
and<00:01:34.979> film<00:01:35.310> a<00:01:35.369> little<00:01:35.520> video<00:01:35.790> of<00:01:36.270> the<00:01:36.689> exam<00:01:36.990> hall

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
and film a little video of the exam hall
