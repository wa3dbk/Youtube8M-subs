catwalk<00:00:46.050> again<00:00:47.090> yeah<00:00:48.090> instead<00:00:48.600> it's<00:00:48.750> just<00:00:48.930> a

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
catwalk again yeah instead it's just a

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:50.810

Mount<00:00:51.059> Everest<00:00:51.420> is<00:00:51.809> not<00:00:51.960> ideal<00:00:52.110> for<00:00:52.410> me

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
Mount Everest is not ideal for me

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.720 
Mount Everest is not ideal for me
because<00:00:52.829> I<00:00:52.920> struggle<00:00:53.309> might<00:00:53.850> be<00:00:53.969> it<00:00:54.059> by<00:00:54.180> large

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:55.730

the<00:00:56.730> blue<00:00:56.940> shoes<00:00:57.239> I<00:00:57.539> want<00:00:57.690> a<00:00:57.750> pair<00:00:57.899> of<00:00:57.989> them<00:00:58.140> I

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
the blue shoes I want a pair of them I

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:59.959 
the blue shoes I want a pair of them I
think<00:00:58.649> it's<00:00:58.800> if<00:00:59.039> you<00:00:59.160> have<00:00:59.280> dog<00:00:59.489> poo<00:00:59.699> on<00:00:59.850> your

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
think it's if you have dog poo on your

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.170 
think it's if you have dog poo on your
shoe<00:01:00.300> it's<00:01:01.079> not<00:01:01.199> to<00:01:01.320> get<00:01:01.379> on<00:01:01.500> the<00:01:02.149> ball<00:01:03.149> just

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
shoe it's not to get on the ball just

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.480 
shoe it's not to get on the ball just
