00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:12.570
 we return that there are some videos nurseries 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.640
 welcome to the channel here we are in a 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.760
 new video a comparison between right 

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:19.110
 and motorcycle club a comparison that is 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.700
 something we are thinking about buying a 

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:24.270
 motorcycle game or something similar 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:25.950
 I hope it's previous 2 with this one so we're going to 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:28.830
 go entertain us more we analyze in a 

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:31.260
 first place the introduction and 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.300
 We analyze the load times as 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.160
 You see, it takes a little longer to load 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.960
 to start 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.060
 the raid I guess it will be because it has 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.160
 a 

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:41.220
 The more data gigabytes you must 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.200
 be a 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:44.960
 Graphically a little better than what 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.969
 good 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:49.520
 the theme of appreciation and platforms 

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:53.690
 available price only here in europe 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:56.150
 it's 59 euros what each game is worth and 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:57.620
 They're available 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:00.380
 the two games on both platforms 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:02.450
 both in dams in box with an xbox and 

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:05.590
 also with the playstation 3 and 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:05.590
 on xbox 360 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.410
 let's analyze now the issue of 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:23.750
 playability the gameplay in this case 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:25.460
 I would bet for raid I do not want either 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.900
 to decant me from the first moment by 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:29.690
 a game because then they tell me that I am 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:31.670
 out there a fan box or any or 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:34.700
 anything so good of all 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:36.470
 forms to me personally in my opinion 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.360
 I liked more raid on the subject 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:41.180
 gameplay because it's more real controls 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:44.240
 The road feels much better 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:45.750
 in the engine control club is a little bit 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:49.620
 plus 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:51.780
 how to say it simpler more made for 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:53.730
 have fun in plan to reach the goal and 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.940
 ready however wright for me in 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:59.670
 understand a little more simulation not 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:02.250
 it's so arcade but it's more simulation 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:06.210
 more enjoy driving 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:08.280
 allows in fact about when we do not 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.800
 lets do those things 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.150
 means that the dead are there I'm not going 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.160
 to do motÃ¶rhead that all the time that 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.350
 if not 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:18.170
 I'm going to sing here 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:19.520
 on motorcycle if it's true that 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.380
 while we are playing for example we 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:25.450
 let's change the bike thing that we do not 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:27.819
 let's do the raid because 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:29.680
 take the motorbike because we will not be able to 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:31.000
 change it but good is a detail that 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.680
 I liked motorcycle a lot since 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.990
 good for example allows us to change to 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.300
 a 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:38.370
 from a superbike to a harley by 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:40.470
 example is similar then well then 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:42.800
 there is enough that is enough vision 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.800
 nice detail 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:23.230
 the realism theme so good to me 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:25.870
 personally I find more real wright 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:27.700
 the detail in the trees results 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.830
 is much better done allows us 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:32.019
 configure the bike in great aspects 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:33.760
 without suspensions wheels and so on 

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:36.280
 while motorcycles there that stays 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:39.849
 a little further back yes that is true 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:41.230
 that I do not know that in my opinion is a 

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:43.959
 little bit more fun is one more game 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:47.560
 fast more to come and go does not have 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:50.440
 so much muddle inside I do not know to 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:53.440
 I understand is much more fun 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:57.500
 more fun good is to say simple no 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:04:00.560
 more than simple fun because yes 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:03.380
 as I say is driving on the accelerator and 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:06.860
 pull forward we have goals in 

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:10.300
 the track we can take turbo by ramps 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:12.320
 in plan crash bandicoot we have 

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:14.500
 minigames within the same track in 

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:17.390
 end yes that is a little more fun 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:19.579
 graphically as I said before is 

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:22.910
 Rather better raid is much better 

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:25.070
 drawn in fact is a very simulator 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:27.020
 good motorcycles the difference of motorcycles 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:28.460
 you have not looked for the simulation but rather 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:30.820
 it's an arcade game looking fun 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:30.820
 etc 

00:04:32.129 --> 00:04:37.889
 social connectivity motors you have to 

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:40.199
 win by beating is a game as you bring 

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:42.629
 club in which we have a club a 

00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:46.379
 team we can invite friends to do is 

00:04:42.629 --> 00:04:49.270
 play play with them and against others 

00:04:46.379 --> 00:04:52.980
 final conclusion to my understanding I would win 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:55.890
 raid why why 

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:58.110
 it's much better game let's say in aspects 

00:04:55.890 --> 00:05:00.960
 general what engines are there that graph 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:02.310
 driving simulation and so on 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:04.800
 ways to do a couple of aspects 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:06.810
 which are fun and for example in what 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:07.980
 social of the game then here it depends 

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:10.110
 a little bit what do you look for 

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:11.910
 face to buy it to see me personally 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:14.070
 I would buy raid because it is not 

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:17.280
 a simulation is to say a mole that 

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:19.620
 He looked for a very vast arcade like the 

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:22.110
 engine singles anyway and the 

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:24.139
 simulations it hits you a little bit 

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:27.050
 put it like that 

00:05:24.139 --> 00:05:28.310
 I would be for motors, because 

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:29.260
 as they are like much more fun and 

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:31.300
 much more 

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:33.820
 well nothing if the video of I hope that you 

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:35.500
 I liked you will deposit I like 

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:37.650
 subscribe to the channel and nothing 

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:37.650
 bye
