00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:12.750
 adult dear friends you look 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.759
 video on android insider dot ru 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.010
 and we continue to get acquainted with the novelties 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:20.640
 which samsung showed us 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:22.890
 today September 25 we are with you 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.330
 looked at samsung galaxy notes if you 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.599
 have not seen a reference in the description there 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.460
 now it's time to show off 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:32.880
 device that was submitted 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:35.160
 Together with the galaxy, laptop 3 is a smart watch 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.570
 samsung galaxy gear this way 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.370
 they look right over here 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.920
 special patch so that they are not dragged away 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.750
 and precisely because of her feeling from 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.450
 devices are now adding up to 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.780
 least not the most pleasant I was not allowed 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.590
 remove it and I did not find a sample 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.940
 irresponsible movie anyway for 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.620
 At first glance, I think we will 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.989
 enough and so let's go quickly 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.739
 go over technical 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.739
 characteristics 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:02.789
 This watch is a display with a patch diagonal 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:05.129
 more than one and a half inches 1.03 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:08.210
 super amoled of course maybe even 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:10.439
 intel now I will not lie that further 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:11.280
 plastic rubber case such 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.490
 strap 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.290
 here we have topics 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.939
 conversation don't do that is you can in 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.159
 principle you walk down the street apply 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.570
 this thing head and 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:23.390
 and catch surprised looks 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:25.969
 job passer here we have 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:28.969
 the camera almost 2 megapixels is also not 

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:31.369
 quite clear why she is needed but if 

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:33.229
 you need something urgent and fast 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:37.250
 take a picture then maybe she will 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:38.299
 this works on android is useful 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:41.179
 4.3 

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:43.609
 and is supplied with a battery with enough 

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:45.649
 low capacity 315 milliampere hours 

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:48.380
 but again it is not clear how much 

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:50.869
 they will be enough let's try 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:53.530
 look now the camera is running not 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:57.129
 so I can twist hope you can see 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:57.129
 people walk around 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:03.399
 photos are made very easy to tap 

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:05.289
 on the screen and photograph ready here 

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:07.240
 we can see the settings mode 

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:12.209
 focus let 's take macro let's 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:12.209
 let's move on 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.930
 really macro mode works 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:22.380
 not bad and very quickly focused 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:25.380
 it is convenient i think by the settings we 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:26.870
 we will not go long because nothing 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:28.560
 there is nothing interesting as you can see 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:31.080
 return in the previous menu 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.989
 implemented very simply then we are with 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:36.830
 wipe from top to bottom and fall into 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:39.200
 previous menu here we can look through 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:43.580
 built-in applications here have a pedometer 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:45.530
 music built-in player with it dylan 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:48.800
 really smart watch gallery but 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:52.540
 understandable here are stored our photos and 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:55.930
 video recordings that we did on the clock 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:03:00.590
 settings and the list of all applications 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:03.110
 let's look through work let's say so 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:04.420
 not very fast but at the same time not 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:07.730
 cause irritation 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:10.550
 you can even say well enough 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:12.800
 let's say that it is very convenient to have a pedometer and 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:15.590
 so thats not how I walk with 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:17.450
 odd bracelet who consider steps 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:21.860
 there is also a pedometer 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:25.520
 his laptop is so disclaimer 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:28.540
 weather can be seen by the whole year 

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:31.190
 you know now let's not be too 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:33.050
 talk about what they can what they don't 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:35.540
 may our words while honestly do not understand 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:37.580
 they need to learn treated because 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:40.730
 that everything is so simple at least to me 

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:43.340
 now not everything is clear in any 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:46.100
 case, this watch will go to our office 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:48.500
 we will definitely test them 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:50.660
 how much they live and how convenient it is 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:53.330
 wear smart watches getting on them 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:55.370
 notifications about kranchik spinning 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:57.830
 nice to get notified on them 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:58.940
 consider with them the steps to listen to music and that 

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:01.220
 amazing to talk on the phone 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:03.019
 we all will surely check it 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:05.209
 ask your question if you have anything 

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:07.100
