00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:36.670 
but I'm sure it would be all right and I
don't<00:02:35.420> know<00:02:35.510> how<00:02:35.720> it<00:02:35.840> is<00:02:35.900> on<00:02:35.930> your<00:02:36.260> country

don't know how it is on your country
well<00:02:37.430> in<00:02:37.610> bc<00:02:38.060> for<00:02:38.420> sure<00:02:38.739> pretty<00:02:39.739> sure<00:02:39.800> all<00:02:39.950> of

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
well in bc for sure pretty sure all of

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:43.990 
well in bc for sure pretty sure all of
canada<00:02:40.849> is<00:02:41.770> when<00:02:42.770> it<00:02:42.860> comes<00:02:43.069> to<00:02:43.280> a<00:02:43.310> rear<00:02:43.610> ender

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
canada is when it comes to a rear ender

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.600 
canada is when it comes to a rear ender
it<00:02:44.630> doesn't<00:02:45.020> matter

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610 
it doesn't matter

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:50.620 
it doesn't matter
what<00:02:47.210> the<00:02:47.420> reason<00:02:47.900> or<00:02:48.550> what<00:02:49.550> happened<00:02:50.120> whoever

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:50.630 
what the reason or what happened whoever

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:52.300 
what the reason or what happened whoever
did<00:02:50.930> the<00:02:51.050> rear<00:02:51.260> ending<00:02:51.650> is<00:02:51.800> always<00:02:51.950> one

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
did the rear ending is always one

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:54.510 
did the rear ending is always one
hundred<00:02:52.520> percent<00:02:52.550> at<00:02:52.820> fault

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:54.520 
hundred percent at fault

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:58.950 
hundred percent at fault
so<00:02:55.030> I<00:02:55.540> imagine<00:02:56.230> that's<00:02:56.380> kind<00:02:56.650> of<00:02:56.770> the<00:02:57.400> same<00:02:57.960> all

00:02:58.950 --> 00:02:58.960 
so I imagine that's kind of the same all

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:03.850 
so I imagine that's kind of the same all
over<00:02:59.020> the<00:02:59.500> world

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:03.860 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:08.870 

so<00:03:04.400> the<00:03:04.520> guy<00:03:04.640> will<00:03:04.790> get<00:03:04.910> his<00:03:05.000> car<00:03:05.210> fixed
