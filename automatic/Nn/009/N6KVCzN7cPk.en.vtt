00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:05.850 
and joy for working in the round with

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:08.930 
and joy for working in the round with
double<00:00:06.330> point<00:00:06.569> needles<00:00:07.460> you<00:00:08.460> begin<00:00:08.760> by

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
double point needles you begin by

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.450 
double point needles you begin by
casting<00:00:09.179> all<00:00:09.690> your<00:00:09.870> stitches<00:00:10.139> onto<00:00:10.679> one

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
casting all your stitches onto one

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.180 
casting all your stitches onto one
needle<00:00:11.910> and<00:00:12.480> I've<00:00:12.599> already<00:00:12.960> cast<00:00:13.170> on<00:00:13.469> 36

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
needle and I've already cast on 36

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.420 
needle and I've already cast on 36
stitches<00:00:14.750> these<00:00:15.750> get<00:00:16.080> divided<00:00:16.440> between<00:00:16.830> three

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
stitches these get divided between three

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.349 
stitches these get divided between three
needles<00:00:17.820> and<00:00:18.660> you<00:00:19.590> do<00:00:19.740> that<00:00:19.949> by<00:00:20.220> slipping<00:00:20.789> one

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
needles and you do that by slipping one

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.859 
needles and you do that by slipping one
third<00:00:21.689> of<00:00:21.960> the<00:00:22.230> stitches<00:00:22.710> onto<00:00:23.010> a<00:00:23.730> free<00:00:24.240> double

farthest<00:00:27.869> from<00:00:28.230> the<00:00:28.380> working<00:00:28.590> yarn<00:00:29.000> that<00:00:30.000> will

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
farthest from the working yarn that will

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.260 
farthest from the working yarn that will
be<00:00:30.300> the<00:00:30.480> first<00:00:30.779> stitch<00:00:31.019> you<00:00:31.289> cast<00:00:31.560> on<00:00:32.180> so<00:00:33.180> I'm

going<00:00:33.450> to<00:00:33.540> slip<00:00:33.780> 12<00:00:35.120> bind<00:00:36.120> to<00:00:36.300> this<00:00:36.480> needle

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:55.390 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:59.760 

with<00:00:55.960> a<00:00:55.990> second<00:00:56.530> free<00:00:56.800> needle<00:00:58.260> you<00:00:59.260> slip<00:00:59.590> the

00:00:59.760 --> 00:00:59.770 
with a second free needle you slip the

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:22.140 
with a second free needle you slip the
next<00:00:59.920> 12<00:01:00.370> stitches

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:22.150 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:26.350 

and<00:01:23.150> now<00:01:23.390> I<00:01:23.420> have<00:01:23.870> three<00:01:24.290> needles<00:01:24.970> each<00:01:25.970> with

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:26.360 
and now I have three needles each with

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.860 
and now I have three needles each with
12<00:01:26.690> stitches<00:01:27.350> and<00:01:28.090> being<00:01:29.090> careful<00:01:29.420> not<00:01:29.660> to

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:29.870 
12 stitches and being careful not to

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:33.070 
12 stitches and being careful not to
twist<00:01:30.230> the<00:01:30.650> stitches<00:01:31.360> between<00:01:32.360> our<00:01:32.870> on<00:01:33.050> the

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:33.080 
twist the stitches between our on the

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:34.900 
twist the stitches between our on the
needles<00:01:33.620> I'm<00:01:33.890> going<00:01:34.130> to<00:01:34.220> form<00:01:34.490> a<00:01:34.580> triangle

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:34.910 
needles I'm going to form a triangle

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:43.870 
needles I'm going to form a triangle
with<00:01:35.480> the<00:01:35.630> working<00:01:36.050> yarn<00:01:36.730> at<00:01:37.730> the<00:01:37.760> top<00:01:42.730> so<00:01:43.730> it

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:43.880 
with the working yarn at the top so it

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.310 
with the working yarn at the top so it
looks<00:01:44.060> like<00:01:44.300> this

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
looks like this

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.360 
looks like this
there<00:01:46.920> are<00:01:47.040> several<00:01:47.310> ways<00:01:47.610> that<00:01:47.640> you<00:01:47.970> can<00:01:48.300> join

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:49.370 
there are several ways that you can join

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:52.160 
there are several ways that you can join
the<00:01:50.370> yarn<00:01:50.640> into<00:01:51.030> a<00:01:51.060> circle<00:01:51.600> but<00:01:51.810> I<00:01:51.900> want<00:01:52.080> to

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
the yarn into a circle but I want to

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.050 
the yarn into a circle but I want to
demonstrate<00:01:52.320> the<00:01:52.860> one<00:01:53.040> I<00:01:53.070> like<00:01:53.400> best

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
demonstrate the one I like best

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.750 
demonstrate the one I like best
I<00:01:54.290> like<00:01:55.290> it<00:01:55.470> best<00:01:55.680> because<00:01:56.010> it<00:01:56.310> doesn't<00:01:56.610> leave

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:56.760 
I like it best because it doesn't leave

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:59.420 
I like it best because it doesn't leave
a<00:01:56.790> stair-step<00:01:57.210> bump<00:01:57.870> to<00:01:58.140> fix<00:01:58.410> later<00:01:58.650> on<00:01:59.040> it's<00:01:59.310> a

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
a stair-step bump to fix later on it's a

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.000 
a stair-step bump to fix later on it's a
pretty<00:01:59.640> smooth<00:01:59.970> joint<00:02:00.380> you<00:02:01.380> take<00:02:01.590> the<00:02:01.770> point

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:02.010 
pretty smooth joint you take the point

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:05.450 
pretty smooth joint you take the point
of<00:02:02.130> the<00:02:02.250> right<00:02:02.430> hand<00:02:02.700> needle<00:02:03.920> into<00:02:04.920> the<00:02:05.130> first
