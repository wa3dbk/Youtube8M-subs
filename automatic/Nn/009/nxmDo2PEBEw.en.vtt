00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:08.469
 very well I moved in three months ago 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:09.030
 can not say it was my 

00:03:08.469 --> 00:03:11.019
 best friend 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:14.889
 I can not say that it was my 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:15.669
 best friend what does it mean 

00:03:14.889 --> 00:03:19.359
 to say what is to say that you had 

00:03:15.669 --> 00:03:20.919
 scuffles but no but knows 

00:03:19.359 --> 00:03:22.659
 was not necessarily good site 

00:03:20.919 --> 00:03:24.819
 we did not necessarily get along hard it's 

00:03:22.659 --> 00:03:26.019
 any time will you say it on 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:27.040
 did not get along well there was shouting at 

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:32.939
 from there me what do I think 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:35.319
 I do not know you do not know I do not know 

00:03:32.939 --> 00:03:36.280
 you say we did not smell well and like 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:37.239
 by chance is attacked 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.790
 that's why I'm asking you 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:40.900
 what do I think it makes sense 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:43.480
 but it's not true 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:46.530
 I come before you calm yourself 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:46.530
 answer to the majors 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:59.230
 I'm pretty reassembled myself I'm doing 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:00.370
 my job I was letting to know 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:01.360
 what happened in front of the 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:03.690
 freshness I realize that you 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:05.440
 have an aggressive behavior 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:06.520
 so I tell myself that there must be a 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:08.530
 report it's not impossible 

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:10.270
 I'm not aggressive I'm coming for 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:11.770
 to testify I find myself accused he did 

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:16.000
 nothing against you this someone you 

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:17.709
 charge here sir then I resume 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.650
 why are you attacking Madame Freshness 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:23.020
 I did not mistreat madam russia 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:25.120
 why why she is not assaulted 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:26.800
 sir sir you tell me we 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.840
 did not get along well there was screaming and 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:29.920
 is done at ante so I deduce from 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:31.450
 the outcome of a scuffle 

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:33.310
 you have like an aggression it's not 

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:34.690
 impossible but I did not mug 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:36.190
 maneuver does not want to let go in this 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:37.600

 exclusively composed of vowels 

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:43.900
