 the higgs boson so the coat of arms to say 

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:37.000
 that it is excellent then 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:42.320
 that the system has on the one disclosed 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:44.600
 dolby surround here the connections and 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.340
 here again the dial and the 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:49.120
 whole is then also talk 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:52.030
 very many languages 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:54.530
 here is just again 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:56.540
 great sound and powerful bass for 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:59.450
 your music films and games so 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:02.060
 together seven advertising on this page 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:05.120
 here again a picture of the device 

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:08.290
 and again the serial number that 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:14.180
 model and down here the whole 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:17.240
 specification again and here again 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:20.180
 all the technical data and on the 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:23.000
 back there is nothing so here 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:27.650
 Now let's see the two speakers 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:29.570
 and the included jack cable for 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:35.630
 Connection to the computer or an mp3 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:38.150
 player that is the left one 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:40.640
 speakers because it's just the 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:44.659
 speaker unit and the texo and 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:47.840
 the brave logo and here below 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:52.610
 a rubber rubber feet with that too 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:56.659
 do not wobble and then the right one 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:59.810
 speaker also has the logo but 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:05.119
 no logitech logo but a 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:09.110
 the knob the volume control and the 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:10.250
 bass regulator and located on the side 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:12.319
 there will be another one now 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.360
 headphone jack with you not always 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:16.910
 if you are for example 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:20.140
 will listen to headphones and not noisy 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:26.209
 from the computer for example and here still 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:29.810
 the connection for the source 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:31.670
 the participation was plug these in 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:36.019
 connection is indeed still on 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:39.319
 subwoofer so that's it now 

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:42.080
 main element of the whole system of 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:45.500
 Seehofer here is the subwoofer 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:48.290
 under a solid metal grid and here 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:51.500
 again the logo on the on the 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:53.140
 strong as before the surface here 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:56.030
 and do not be surprised 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:58.760
 I have this filmstrip 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:01.069
 made on these edges here 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.870
 already very easily broken 

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:07.010
 the very the whole material 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:10.090
 sensitive to scratching is then on this 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:15.430
 side of the air outlet for the basses 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:19.579
 again and that is made of hard plastic 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:25.060
 The whole thing is also made of wood and then 

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:27.799
 here the connections 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:32.900
 it opens up here once 

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:35.840
 the vcs connection left right then still 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:39.310
 one on his lock jack and here 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.310
 the connection 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:46.060
 this one there speak for the right one 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:48.790
 because there must be all these 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:51.280
 data to the subwoofer come to 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:52.690
 main unit and there you can then this 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:57.069
 connection sends out a bit like 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:58.900
 its display connection vga connection and 

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:04.140
 you put it here then come easy 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:11.260
 plug in and the connection underneath 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:13.120
 this one developed here is for that one 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:16.000
 left speaker you plug 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:19.690
 just like that with a whole 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:23.650
 my connection a yes out is here 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:31.120
 then again on what everything 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:38.320
 so to speak can be seen as the idea 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:41.169
 empathy 50 hertz then 220 to 240 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:43.539
 volt it's just the current what time 

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:49.090
 six must have the maximum minimum 

00:04:43.539 --> 00:04:50.440
 family peer and yes the whole 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:53.560
 Serial numbers and stuff like that 

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:57.070
 that was it first with the subwoofer like that 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:58.889
 come to the final view 

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:05.169
 point as you want to call it 

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:08.470
 that is that logitech z 623 one 

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:13.169
 really very good system from the price 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:15.880
 sounds as good as a home theater system 

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:18.940
 600 euro costs and that costs belief 

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:23.560
 I then 130 something and I would 

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:27.669
 Definitely recommend and now 

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:29.410
 Let's do a bass test for it 

00:05:27.669 --> 00:05:30.910
 it was not so good now but you 

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:33.370
 you can imagine it a bit 

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:34.960
 because you realize that pretty much here 

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:38.280
 starts a lot 

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:38.280
 By the way, to say 

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:59.950
 so even if maybe thought now 

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:03.940
 have a great time 

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:05.470
 that can have something nice here but 

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:07.540
 I do not hear it, I recommend it 

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:10.300
 rise a damn good 

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:13.090
 Sound quality and if you are the next 

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:14.620
 times in media market is clear you can 

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:15.840
 listen to it here at is there is not 

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:18.730
 everywhere the system 

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:20.230
 thanks for watching the video 

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:22.000
