00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:55.759 
Christie was showing me earlier it's not
the<00:03:54.720> most<00:03:54.810> effective<00:03:55.079> thing<00:03:55.409> because<00:03:55.620> he<00:03:55.680> had

00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:55.769 
the most effective thing because he had

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:57.710 
the most effective thing because he had
thought<00:03:56.010> of<00:03:56.040> uses<00:03:56.459> for<00:03:56.489> an<00:03:56.760> but<00:03:57.390> they<00:03:57.450> give<00:03:57.599> him

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
thought of uses for an but they give him

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.089 
thought of uses for an but they give him
his<00:03:57.840> other<00:03:57.989> senses<00:03:58.230> well<00:03:58.680> the<00:03:58.769> one<00:03:58.890> we<00:03:59.010> just

00:03:59.089 --> 00:03:59.099 
his other senses well the one we just

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:02.059 
his other senses well the one we just
literally<00:03:59.579> switches<00:04:00.200> sides<00:04:01.200> yeah<00:04:01.620> I<00:04:01.650> believe

00:04:02.059 --> 00:04:02.069 
literally switches sides yeah I believe

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:04.250 
literally switches sides yeah I believe
so<00:04:02.340> I<00:04:02.670> but<00:04:03.390> he<00:04:03.450> has<00:04:03.540> a<00:04:03.569> move<00:04:03.810> that<00:04:03.930> does<00:04:04.079> that

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
so I but he has a move that does that

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.920 
so I but he has a move that does that
okay<00:04:04.760> he<00:04:05.760> also<00:04:05.880> has<00:04:06.120> a<00:04:06.150> stamp<00:04:06.450> so<00:04:06.599> you'd<00:04:06.810> be<00:04:06.900> a
