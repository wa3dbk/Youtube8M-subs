00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:12.230
 montevideo 26 ansa 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.230
 this same command very good 

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:20.640
 ah 

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:26.849
 or 

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:33.890
 to 

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:33.890
 ah 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.890
 plus 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.179
 two 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:52.900
 ah 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:52.900
 all 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.900
 hello everyone how are they alone 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.700
 land I bring you this new video and 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:08.560
 I bring you the first simulation of 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:10.689
 new channel already after the tragedy 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.490
 of the other but not start in it we're going to 

00:01:10.689 --> 00:01:15.700
 start at the good thing that is left by 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:18.340
 ahead and good we have this combat the 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:20.830
 big show against seamus in a test match 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:23.110
 with ba chair lifts in which he knew good 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:24.340
 you can use only this object in case 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:27.190
 that you want to catch some object only 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:29.229
 can use classes the chairs sorry 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:30.909
 and you have to hit him with you 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:34.539
 hit with them perfectly so 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:36.490
 I think it's going to win semiaus something 

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:38.050
 something tells me that he will win semus and if 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:40.810
 it does not win, it's very likely 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:44.590
 as they said they would give him the title for 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:46.360
 couples to a king mysterio and so face and 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:48.819
 daniel bryan would remove the title 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:51.190
 the heavy weights to mixed and the truth 

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:52.929
 it would be very interesting to me I would like 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:54.789
 pretty see adam and ryan maybe champion 

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:57.069
 I liked it a lot in the bryant as 

00:01:54.789 --> 00:02:00.340
 heavyweight champion but good 

00:01:57.069 --> 00:02:01.929
 I am a lucido I decide it the ww so 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.010
 we think about combat and my prediction 

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:07.640
 it's going to win sheamus 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:09.350
 and I would like you to follow sheamus vicson 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:14.090
 I would like you to redeem dolph 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:17.240
 ziggler the site has been many months and 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:20.090
 good although although the tlc exchange it 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:21.530
 it would be very repetitive would be very 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:23.570
 interesting again see notice or 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.340
 angry because he has lost the title and 

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:27.650
 he has returned here in the return exchange 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:30.320
 above him the money in the bank but 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.580
 well I would like to see double champion 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:33.410
 the heavyweights have not seen him 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:36.740
 well you saw a smackdown show 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:39.410
 about 15 minutes until it reached 20 made 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:41.060
 and it was taken off again and nothing has not 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:43.760
 had opportunities two centuries for the 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:47.360
 title of the vw and by the heavyweight 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:49.180
 but never has been victorious only 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:52.880
 has had minor titles like that of 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:54.530
 usa the intercontinental but to the but 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:57.530
 nothing else has been in good reigns but 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:59.750
 they have not put anything anything greater so 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:02.150
 I think it 's the right time if 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:04.610
 it is not the tlc that is the royal rumble of 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:06.590
 redeem the money in the bank man 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:08.990
 would be a puntazo swap book now 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:12.020
 but the sooner I think the better 

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:14.060
 he must face well 

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:15.530
 cheers match is going to be a good match 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:17.510
 as I said and I hope that I have 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:18.340
 liked the video life favorites and up 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:21.340
 the next 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.340
 goodbye
