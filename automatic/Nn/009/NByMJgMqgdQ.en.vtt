00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.750
 hello hello hello people welcome 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.790
 back to minecraft i have a new one 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:30.510
 tutorial prepared for you 

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:32.760
 It's about e-mails with blocks 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:38.540
 What you can do with it where I get it 

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:42.239
 It can be so I have here once 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:42.930
 extreme mountain billion sought and also 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:47.430
 found 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:51.690
 in creative mode then go up 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:55.670
 here builds up and that the doctors 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:58.800
 look like they can, however, only 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:01.400
 in individual blocks so in individual 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.510
 find doctors 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:05.489
 that's what it does in the course, of course 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:09.270
 even harder to look for them and 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:11.370
 to find or then masses of it too 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.440
 she still only finds it as 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:17.180
 individual doctors 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:24.000
 if you do that then if you will then 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:27.050
 he has degraded it is such a stop 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:31.290
 simply one has as 1 1 in emmerich 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:33.860
 From this money you can then with new ones 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.860
 piece 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:42.670
 1m with blog forces most of the time only 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:49.240
 can use for decoration or 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:51.730
 even if it comes out film work in 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:54.480
 Progress blog for the baw station 

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:57.340
 so to speak you can pick something up 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:02:02.350
 you can then use it as the pyramid 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:03.600
 arranged then can find natural 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:07.869
 could also fill in 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:11.380
 the higher the pyramid is, the higher it is 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:13.450
 So it has more sea function 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:18.340
 she can arms and last longer 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:22.540
 the bass I think so synonymous this 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:25.630
 You can then find rhine with the 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:27.910
 wilders want to exchange leather cap 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:29.080
 got accurate exchange've tutorial 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:30.750
 I already prepared you can 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:35.020
 find a channel 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:37.450
 Trixi does not give enough of that then 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:38.340
 Let's go down to react 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:42.610
 height 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:46.239
 y 12 at height one also diamonds 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:49.690
 finds and most doctors and old 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:50.769
 simply the best mining level I have 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:53.160
 Just go straight through this 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:55.540
 dug 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.760
 I leave all the doctors far as 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:01.200
 so that the difference to the times 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:04.000
 doctors can see how often what is there 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:06.300
 I find a way here 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.300
 Find 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:10.440
 there was nothing 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:20.820
 I have just back there was still 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:26.350
 the cave found there is explained 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:28.870
 that says again individually and right here 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:38.680
 I have not found it yet 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:39.610
 again a tent so on and on me 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:42.130
 know they can perhaps also 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:45.490
 find it twice then it is more luck 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:48.310
 that they are there besides then so here 

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:50.860
 we have you I have more in total 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:55.540
 the yes found as emails, however 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:57.820
 less the veins than engels the 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:00.880
 Total number of dias I found 

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:04.360
 have they are still more than I to 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:05.800
 found aids that means even in 

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:09.450
 extremely bio factory is my 

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:09.450
 conclusion that I have more 

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:18.730
 Parents, however, still find more 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:22.680
 dias out so get the emre 

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:22.680
 so to speak for me the rarest 

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:30.220
 can and should invent 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:33.370
 accordingly, then try too 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:35.980
 treat or pay attention to it 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:37.540
 just going in the extreme plant was here 

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:41.110
 then the last one found in the mobile phone 

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:43.860
 has or was looking for as you can see are 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:46.600
 the camerons are camping extremely 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:51.280
 You can find them in extremely vacuum 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:53.850
 more often than ever, however 

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:53.850
 only individually 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:59.819
 so if you are expensive things from the 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:01.400
 have images I can only wish 

00:04:59.819 --> 00:05:02.580
 recommend in the extreme work the order to 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:04.710
 mean 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:07.160
 there you can diamonds and 

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:10.199
 find emerald 

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:11.729
