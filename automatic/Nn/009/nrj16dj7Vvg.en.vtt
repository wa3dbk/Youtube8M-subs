00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:13.240 

now<00:00:10.880> the<00:00:11.330> way<00:00:11.450> I'm<00:00:11.630> visualizing<00:00:12.559> this<00:00:12.950> is<00:00:13.219> a

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:13.250 
now the way I'm visualizing this is a

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:15.209 
now the way I'm visualizing this is a
lot<00:00:13.580> it'll<00:00:14.000> look<00:00:14.090> a<00:00:14.240> lot<00:00:14.420> like<00:00:14.599> that

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:15.219 
lot it'll look a lot like that

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:21.999 
lot it'll look a lot like that
except<00:00:16.219> it'll<00:00:16.340> be<00:00:17.260> about<00:00:19.540> 12<00:00:20.540> or<00:00:20.840> 13<00:00:21.050> or<00:00:21.560> 14

00:00:21.999 --> 00:00:22.009 
except it'll be about 12 or 13 or 14

00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:24.670 
except it'll be about 12 or 13 or 14
inches<00:00:22.250> shorter<00:00:22.810> so<00:00:23.810> that<00:00:23.960> it's<00:00:24.079> not<00:00:24.200> actually

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:24.680 
inches shorter so that it's not actually

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:26.769 
inches shorter so that it's not actually
taller<00:00:24.950> than<00:00:25.279> the<00:00:25.400> car<00:00:25.640> so<00:00:26.509> that<00:00:26.660> the

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:26.779 
taller than the car so that the

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:33.660 
taller than the car so that the
coca-cola<00:00:27.820> would<00:00:28.820> come<00:00:29.059> down<00:00:29.239> to<00:00:29.390> about<00:00:29.599> here

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:33.670 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:36.660 

we've<00:00:34.670> got<00:00:34.820> this<00:00:34.969> nice<00:00:35.210> stainless<00:00:36.140> steel

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:36.670 
we've got this nice stainless steel

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:40.090 
we've got this nice stainless steel
cooler<00:00:37.670> inside<00:00:38.270> here<00:00:38.680> which<00:00:39.680> is<00:00:39.829> where<00:00:39.980> we

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:40.100 
cooler inside here which is where we

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.750 
cooler inside here which is where we
could<00:00:40.250> put<00:00:41.140> we<00:00:42.140> could<00:00:42.320> either<00:00:42.440> put<00:00:42.800> clothes

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:43.760 
could put we could either put clothes

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:45.400 
could put we could either put clothes
and<00:00:44.210> stuff<00:00:44.390> in<00:00:44.570> here<00:00:44.780> if<00:00:44.899> we<00:00:45.019> wanted<00:00:45.260> to<00:00:45.320> get

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:45.410 
and stuff in here if we wanted to get

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:46.750 
and stuff in here if we wanted to get
really<00:00:45.649> fancy<00:00:45.829> we<00:00:46.129> could<00:00:46.249> fill<00:00:46.429> it<00:00:46.519> full<00:00:46.640> of

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:46.760 
really fancy we could fill it full of

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:51.759 
really fancy we could fill it full of
ice<00:00:46.879> and<00:00:47.179> fill<00:00:47.329> it<00:00:47.449> full<00:00:47.480> of<00:00:47.600> drinks<00:00:50.649> and<00:00:51.649> I<00:00:51.710> do

00:00:51.759 --> 00:00:51.769 
ice and fill it full of drinks and I do

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:54.310 
ice and fill it full of drinks and I do
like<00:00:52.100> the<00:00:52.280> buggy<00:00:52.460> Springs<00:00:52.909> on<00:00:53.120> the<00:00:53.239> back<00:00:53.420> now

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:54.320 
like the buggy Springs on the back now

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:55.479 
like the buggy Springs on the back now
that<00:00:54.469> I<00:00:54.530> kind<00:00:54.739> of<00:00:54.769> got<00:00:54.920> them<00:00:55.039> up<00:00:55.159> here<00:00:55.339> where<00:00:55.460> I

00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:55.489 
that I kind of got them up here where I

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:58.029 
that I kind of got them up here where I
can<00:00:55.609> see<00:00:55.850> them<00:00:55.969> I<00:00:56.319> can<00:00:57.319> just<00:00:57.559> imagine<00:00:57.679> it

00:00:58.029 --> 00:00:58.039 
can see them I can just imagine it

00:00:58.039 --> 00:00:59.979 
can see them I can just imagine it
sitting<00:00:58.339> a<00:00:58.429> little<00:00:58.609> lower<00:00:58.760> look<00:00:59.210> it<00:00:59.809> looked

00:00:59.979 --> 00:00:59.989 
sitting a little lower look it looked

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:03.399 
sitting a little lower look it looked
pretty<00:01:00.079> honking<00:01:00.559> yeah<00:01:02.019> alright<00:01:03.019> that's<00:01:03.350> the

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:03.409 
pretty honking yeah alright that's the

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:05.770 
pretty honking yeah alright that's the
plan<00:01:03.620> all<00:01:04.010> righty<00:01:04.400> well<00:01:04.550> I'll<00:01:05.239> clean<00:01:05.510> up<00:01:05.540> this

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:05.780 
plan all righty well I'll clean up this

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.260 
plan all righty well I'll clean up this
frame<00:01:06.110> some<00:01:06.350> more<00:01:06.729> and<00:01:07.729> then<00:01:07.820> you<00:01:07.909> come<00:01:08.120> back

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:08.270 
frame some more and then you come back

00:01:08.270 --> 00:03:00.000 
frame some more and then you come back
we'll<00:01:08.420> look<00:01:08.510> at<00:01:08.659> it<00:01:08.780> again

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.860 

okay<00:03:01.010> I<00:03:01.040> did<00:03:01.280> this<00:03:01.430> pretty<00:03:01.639> much<00:03:01.879> entirely<00:03:02.480> for

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
okay I did this pretty much entirely for

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:06.309 
okay I did this pretty much entirely for
the<00:03:04.689> opportunity<00:03:05.689> to<00:03:05.810> kind<00:03:06.019> of<00:03:06.109> have<00:03:06.290> a

00:03:06.309 --> 00:03:06.319 
the opportunity to kind of have a

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:08.679 
the opportunity to kind of have a
mock-up<00:03:06.949> of<00:03:07.189> what<00:03:07.489> this<00:03:07.939> would<00:03:08.090> look<00:03:08.150> like<00:03:08.480> if

00:03:08.679 --> 00:03:08.689 
mock-up of what this would look like if

00:03:08.689 --> 00:03:13.599 
mock-up of what this would look like if
it<00:03:08.840> was<00:03:08.989> chopped<00:03:09.290> down<00:03:12.489> it's<00:03:13.489> probably

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:13.609 
it was chopped down it's probably

00:03:13.609 --> 00:03:18.729 
it was chopped down it's probably
sitting<00:03:14.000> a<00:03:14.030> little<00:03:14.209> lower<00:03:15.819> you<00:03:16.819> know<00:03:17.739> yeah

00:03:18.729 --> 00:03:18.739 
sitting a little lower you know yeah

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:19.959 
sitting a little lower you know yeah
it's<00:03:19.040> probably<00:03:19.159> sitting<00:03:19.549> a<00:03:19.579> little<00:03:19.790> lower

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:19.969 
it's probably sitting a little lower

00:03:19.969 --> 00:03:28.050 
it's probably sitting a little lower
than<00:03:20.239> it<00:03:20.359> would

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:28.060 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:31.539 

hmm<00:03:29.230> hard<00:03:30.230> for<00:03:30.379> me<00:03:30.439> to<00:03:30.530> make<00:03:30.680> my<00:03:30.829> eyeballs<00:03:31.250> see

00:03:31.539 --> 00:03:31.549 
hmm hard for me to make my eyeballs see

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:32.819 
hmm hard for me to make my eyeballs see
how<00:03:31.700> this<00:03:31.879> is<00:03:32.060> going<00:03:32.239> to<00:03:32.299> look<00:03:32.480> exactly

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:32.829 
how this is going to look exactly

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:36.069 
how this is going to look exactly
because<00:03:33.829> this<00:03:34.040> would<00:03:34.219> be<00:03:34.370> smaller<00:03:35.079> shorter

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:36.079 
because this would be smaller shorter

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:39.069 
because this would be smaller shorter
and<00:03:36.859> it<00:03:36.950> would<00:03:37.069> be<00:03:37.189> up<00:03:37.310> off<00:03:37.519> the<00:03:37.700> ground<00:03:38.079> and

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:39.079 
and it would be up off the ground and

00:03:39.079 --> 00:03:42.849 
and it would be up off the ground and
this<00:03:39.260> axle<00:03:39.939> would<00:03:40.939> be<00:03:41.090> back<00:03:41.329> here<00:03:41.780> I<00:03:41.989> mean<00:03:42.769> this

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:42.859 
this axle would be back here I mean this

00:03:42.859 --> 00:03:44.229 
this axle would be back here I mean this
spring<00:03:43.189> would<00:03:43.370> be<00:03:43.459> back<00:03:43.640> here<00:03:43.849> behind<00:03:43.970> the

00:03:44.229 --> 00:03:44.239 
spring would be back here behind the

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:46.210 
spring would be back here behind the
axle<00:03:44.629> and<00:03:44.659> all<00:03:44.840> this<00:03:45.019> extra<00:03:45.349> metal<00:03:45.709> right<00:03:45.890> here

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:46.220 
axle and all this extra metal right here

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:52.059 
axle and all this extra metal right here
I'm<00:03:46.340> going<00:03:46.430> to<00:03:46.489> cut<00:03:46.760> off<00:03:50.650> I'm<00:03:51.650> just<00:03:51.920> going<00:03:52.040> to

00:03:52.059 --> 00:03:52.069 
I'm going to cut off I'm just going to

00:03:52.069 --> 00:04:01.179 
I'm going to cut off I'm just going to
get<00:03:52.189> a<00:03:52.220> better<00:03:52.489> a<00:03:52.939> better<00:03:53.750> idea<00:03:54.170> how<00:04:00.189> see

00:04:01.179 --> 00:04:01.189 
get a better a better idea how see

00:04:01.189 --> 00:04:15.960 
get a better a better idea how see
that's<00:04:01.400> too<00:04:01.579> low<00:04:02.650> that's<00:04:03.650> about<00:04:03.950> where<00:04:11.560> I

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:15.970 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:18.219 

think<00:04:16.970> this<00:04:17.329> is<00:04:17.449> going<00:04:17.570> to<00:04:17.630> turn<00:04:17.780> into<00:04:17.840> one<00:04:18.019> of

00:04:18.219 --> 00:04:18.229 
think this is going to turn into one of

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:19.390 
think this is going to turn into one of
those<00:04:18.289> deals<00:04:18.560> where<00:04:18.709> I'm<00:04:18.919> gonna<00:04:19.070> have<00:04:19.280> to

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:19.400 
those deals where I'm gonna have to

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:22.779 
those deals where I'm gonna have to
build<00:04:19.609> it<00:04:20.049> in<00:04:21.049> order<00:04:21.289> to<00:04:21.410> look<00:04:21.530> at<00:04:21.769> it<00:04:21.889> I<00:04:22.070> just

00:04:22.779 --> 00:04:22.789 
build it in order to look at it I just

00:04:22.789 --> 00:04:26.920 
build it in order to look at it I just
got<00:04:23.030> to<00:04:23.150> think<00:04:23.300> about<00:04:23.509> this<00:04:23.630> more<00:04:23.870> and<00:04:25.840> see<00:04:26.840> if

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:26.930 
got to think about this more and see if

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:29.170 
got to think about this more and see if
I<00:04:27.050> can<00:04:27.169> figure<00:04:27.289> out<00:04:27.500> what<00:04:27.710> how<00:04:28.430> exactly<00:04:28.910> I<00:04:29.030> want

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:29.180 
I can figure out what how exactly I want

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:31.360 
I can figure out what how exactly I want
to<00:04:29.240> go
