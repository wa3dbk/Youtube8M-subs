00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:05.130
 today i am in belfort in the east 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:08.180
 from France and we will meet the 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.180
 photographers and telecoms 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:27.509
 etienne I would like to know a little more 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.009
 on you I let you introduce yourself ok 

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:31.769
 my name is coop and 

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:33.420
 I live in belfort I'm a photographer 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.780
 for a few years 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.629
 now 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.670
 and basically I'm doing a lot of areas 

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:39.900
 different be it from the portrait of 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.940
 things a bit traditional like 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:44.300
 wedding 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.559
 reports in a global way and 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:49.100
 when I can projects more 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.969
 personal to express themselves a little more 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:53.760
 since you gave us an appointment 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.350
 to throw down the base I had planned to 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.670
 take you to an apartment that is 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.710
 completely empty because it comes 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.140
 to be moved to be able to precisely 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.579
 focus on on the model and in 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.860
 really make the central element of the 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.630
 session is ultimately actually coming 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.659
 here I told myself that frankly 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.530
 the universe sells really great and like 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.000
 I know a little bit about the tauliers 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.500
 I would have asked if we could really 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:21.090
 to make the session here we will pass 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:25.190
 this will be where we will welcome charlotte 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.190
 who is a model for suicide girls 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:29.100
 the advantage of working with charlotte 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.470
 it's because I'm someone 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.600
 have known for a long time we know 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.429
 two cases no ambiguity between us and 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.490
 I know she will not want to show anything 

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:43.460
 too intimate and then it's up to me 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.460
 the picture of staying respectful that 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:47.939
 unlike a context if the photo 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.369
 group or photos of landscapes where we have 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:52.590
 often need that every honest month 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:54.810
 in the portrait a something that me 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.689
 Characterize not bad is that I appreciate 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.560
 everything is not far from full openness 

00:01:56.689 --> 00:02:01.140
 because I enjoy blocking it in 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.420
 background so this is also one of 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.670
 why my gear is 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:10.140
 mainly primes the 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:12.660
 fall to the 35 set at the 135 sets most 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.250
 time and it allows me precisely 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:17.069
 to have a very good quality from the 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:19.739
 full open and I like to have 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:21.450
 a fairly shallow depth of field 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:24.750
 why because in fact with the 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:26.130
 landscape natural lines or moldings of 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.140
 town planning in general I can create some 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:30.780
 lines of dynamism I can put in 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.340
 value the subject I can actually draw 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.599
 with the background and that's some 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.900
 I like to take into account 

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:35.900
 his laurels 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:41.670
 which helps me to stay creative in fact 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:43.080
 it's discovering discovering more 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:46.320
 things on the football pitch that's why 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:47.520
 also that I do not plan everything and for 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:49.890
 that mainly that I rarely do 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:51.390
 sessions in the same place ie 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:54.330
 that just play on 6 of 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:56.400
 architectures on the lines and where if I 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:57.780
 do it once but after that 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.130
 seems interested to come to the same 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.990
 place but the person the same 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:02.820
 place that says look hate line but 

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:04.500
 you did not do it that's not it 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:05.910
 interesting is also precisely 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.320
 to live something on the day of the session 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:10.380
 that's why I prefer 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:12.180
 portraits is to live a kind of 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:15.480
 adventure during the session this is the 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:17.790
 live with others and realize the 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.110
 potential of each place or even a 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.000
 line of flight that is interesting 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:23.210
 discover it the day j with the good 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.680
 lighting in the right place 

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:28.770
 that 's almost an adventure at every 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:30.000
 times during sessions in general I 

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:30.660
 know what I want is the result 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.420
 I 'm going to get 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:34.560
 so I am rather directive myself there is 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:36.840
 always a notion of respect necessarily 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:40.050
 not registered on people but I 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:41.489
 tendency to lead know how to say to which 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:42.989
 place we can best capture the 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:44.970
 light that showcases someone 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:46.680
 because the interest of the portrait also 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:49.650
 is that you guess things if the 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:54.209
 people that they know you come back a little 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:56.640
 in their private domain but without 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:57.959
 to be indiscreet that is to say that as 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:00.390
 and as the session ended, 

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:01.830
 understand that the person hates his 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:03.690
 profile or tests were born then 

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:05.730
 come back to make her comfortable 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:08.040
 on that side and do not necessarily 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:10.350
 pictures or lcl she will not be at her 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:12.600
 advantage makes a kind of mirror of the 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:15.209
 nobody to put it best 

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:16.100
 possible to his advantage I try to 

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:20.120
 to eat is to have a guy 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:20.120
 relatively objective 

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:23.790
 no
