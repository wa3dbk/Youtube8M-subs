00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:06.720
 ah 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.759
 [Music] 

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:17.619
 with friends then after a good 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:19.210
 time I bring you another mega mod 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:21.700
 I know I had promised you the gta 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:26.200
 narco mexico version 3 I still do not finish it 

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:27.880
 but then I decided to do this 

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:31.509
 The only difference is very good 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:34.510
 is that because I did not put him 

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:40.420
 Mexican stores and that but it comes as 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:42.290
 with 90% of cars comes with I put a 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:48.420
 speedometer 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:51.720
 patrols the front h and is very good 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:55.380
 this this mega mod brings patrols of 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:59.580
 federal police force brings new 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:01:02.610
 New streets try in the sky more more 

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:04.629
 real is very good and well then there 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:07.299
 I put more things 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:09.630
 and as you can see in the pictures as 

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:14.610
 it looks good 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:17.850
 this well are 5 links 5 parts 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:20.870
 and as you already know we need 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:23.610
 have a game without mods a fair game 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:27.150
 In case you do not have a game I'm going to 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:29.820
 leave a link to download it and 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:33.660
 well then let's start downloading 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:35.610
 the parts of the mega mod as already 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:38.430
 you know here they wait the 5 seconds and you 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:42.090
 we give in jumping advertising if it comes out 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:45.990
 this and the baby in ax to close it 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:48.240
 ok we hope here they will not put anything 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:51.770
 abnormal in insulting advertising them 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:54.810
 I clarify that the links had 4 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:56.640
 because all the servers already 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.569
 close accounts and upload heavy files 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:02.310
 or they want you to pay and that's so 

00:01:59.569 --> 00:02:03.959
 when they give in to download if they do not have 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.509
 account will ask you to register 

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:09.330
 so well you know they register is 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:10.890
 easy here you are waiting for you 20 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.319
 seconds also I do not see anything 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:16.840
 because it's my the wait 20 file 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:20.680
 seconds and they give in free download 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:24.910
 ok ok and start downloading no 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:28.720
 greatly delays the total weight of the 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:30.250
 five parts are 700 megabytes in total already 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.739
 downloaded the five parts 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:34.959
 remember they have to download all there 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:36.640
 Sometimes they tell you that for 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:39.640
 others and that and well and you know the 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:41.590
 everyone and right now they have the 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:43.630
 rar files I am going to comment on a 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:46.570
 problem that sometimes happens 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:48.790
 at the moment of giving you in extract here 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:51.760
 there is an error that says that the 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:54.430

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:57.650

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:03.920
 ok so try with everyone to pass the 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:09.170
 same 140 minus one fifth is the 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:11.599
 that weighs less weighs 132 and well since 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:14.090

 ok here is going to finish this is fast 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:32.900
 this installer is going to leave us 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:38.660
 that appears as a little flag of mexico 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:41.260
 we give you right click to execute as 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:41.260
 administrator 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:47.709
 ok they will appear this there they read it 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:49.959

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:55.629
 accept here they reread everything that 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:58.930
 I wrote let's examine and go to 

00:03:55.629 --> 00:04:01.300
 find the route of our game you know 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:04.239
 they have to find the correct route to 

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:06.040

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:09.400

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:11.370
 desktop do not have it look for it and well 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:13.930
 I have many games installed here 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:17.320
 but I'm going to install it in this 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:20.639

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:20.639
 we give in install 

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:27.560
 ok the installation is fast I do not tell them 

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:30.680
 it does not weigh much 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:34.430
 I want to comment you do not add no 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:36.980
 add skins characters but I'm going to 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:38.990
 leave an extra link for whoever wants 

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:41.810
 putting the characters puts them apart 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:44.480
 because you can give them water something 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:46.760
 and it is better that they try this way already if they want 

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:49.240
 to your liking they put what are the 

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:49.240
 skins 

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:54.210

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:56.220

 I also told them an extra file that 

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:00.600
 flame point and d vehicle because 

00:04:59.009 --> 00:05:04.349
 after I finish uploading 

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:07.919
 files a car left with the tires 

00:05:04.349 --> 00:05:10.750
 bad and that's why I put it aside but now 

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:14.370
 it was fixed 

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:16.720

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:19.900
