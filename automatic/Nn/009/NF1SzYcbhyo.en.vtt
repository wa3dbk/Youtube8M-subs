00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 Good day to all ladies and 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:06.990
 gentlemen my name is nope saibot and this 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.799
 guide how to farm antimagom from the first 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.280
 lavela in the forest 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.809
 chip work for the darkness recently I 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.269
 wrote down the guide on how farma with 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:18.140
 Alchemist on Enshten it was a chip 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:22.050
 light but it is respectively then 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:27.390
 first purchase buy hatchet and on 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:32.420
 Damage 1 2 on the table where we buy 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:35.160
 rm strum twigs need to go to this point 

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:37.739
 This farm reminds farm Furion well 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:42.649
 know when he's teleported here a 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:45.480
 then here if you are too strong 

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:47.340
 buried on the line you do not give 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.309
 farm or possible too new 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.500
 series no one gives you a farm that is 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:55.890
 this can help you in the game wrong 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.570
 more than once people are surprised but it 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:01.170
 works anyway it's better than 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:04.019
 nothing but repeat that stand on the line 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:08.100
 anyway it's always better than doing 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:09.390
 Here is such a garbage but again this 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:21.060
 better than doing nothing 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:23.840
 Creep forward to seeing it at 30 seconds 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:28.259
 there is up in this case we don't need 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:30.479
 no flaps tango nothing on the hilka 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:34.979
 we stupidly have to stand and farm 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:36.780
 cheat you in there like that or 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.659
 something else to calm to farm 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.700
 further in the forest 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:43.710
 Creeps appeared to farm immediately and they were not 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:47.060
 I will make double stack double stack if 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.270
 who does not know is done at 53 seconds on 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:52.409
 53 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:55.200
 then again on 53 then on 52 on 51 and 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:58.140
 by reduction but rarely obtained 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:04.200
 do honestly more than three or four 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:05.509
 I personally all Agra creeps should go 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:10.280
 get a double stack 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:13.739
 on we got further we do the following 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:16.379
 for blinky at all in this area cut it 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:20.760
 tree and calmly cut creeps 

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:23.510
 The trick is that the attack range even 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:26.569
 melee on heroes more than that 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:30.360
 creeps therefore I calmly stand them 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:32.430
 they can't beat me accordingly 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:35.489
 If possible, always do it from the water 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:37.500
 there is if you see that you do not have time 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:40.550
 farm this pack also damn scram 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:44.280
 take away and when i watched all the time 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:47.640
 Hyde is the same as I shoot 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:51.120
 the dude knew how to take it off 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:54.269
 here at these points the trees and walked here 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:57.480
 here here to the flashlight somewhere here flashlight 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:59.730
 should be here in my swing plus signs 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:02.390
 to have more damage 53 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.390
 i went 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:07.620
 i will swing blink at home cabling damage 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:16.120
 again davos and so on 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.920
 if creeps aggro we cut down here 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.930
 trees nothing terrible is not Match 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.849
 that is when they started to knock you down 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:26.560
 you need to move away here and again just 

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:28.239
 come up and beat them all just nothing 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:30.609
 Difficult in this method is not again 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:33.370
 I repeat if you have a support on 

00:03:30.609 --> 00:03:37.689
 line if no one bothers you farm 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:39.909
 better farm on line but if you donâ€™t 

00:03:37.689 --> 00:03:43.269
 give the farm do not have to endure and merge 

00:03:39.909 --> 00:03:45.280
 the game that is, if you understand that the game 

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:48.219
 will reach leith you can safely go here 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:50.939
 in the absence of pharma on the line any 

00:03:48.219 --> 00:03:53.049
 cause and farm in such a way and 

00:03:50.939 --> 00:03:55.989
 Timan I finished so you need 

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:58.030
 something to buy at Mona do not know 

00:03:55.989 --> 00:03:59.650
 you can tell yourself to take a couple instead 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:05.230
 Now these two twigs but here I am an ordinary 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:09.459
 damage all 455 you can catch all 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:11.560
 nine did not have time well and in the same spirit 

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:14.139
