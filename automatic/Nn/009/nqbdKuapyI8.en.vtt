might<00:05:21.760> notice<00:05:22.120> I<00:05:22.810> just<00:05:23.170> get<00:05:23.980> the<00:05:24.070> focus<00:05:26.670> the

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:27.670 
might notice I just get the focus the

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:30.890 
might notice I just get the focus the
Millennium<00:05:28.120> Falcon<00:05:28.950> compared<00:05:29.950> to<00:05:30.100> this<00:05:30.250> guy

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:30.900 
Millennium Falcon compared to this guy

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:36.420 
Millennium Falcon compared to this guy
it's<00:05:31.900> way<00:05:32.050> too<00:05:32.110> big<00:05:33.450> not<00:05:34.650> 100%<00:05:35.650> sure<00:05:35.980> of<00:05:36.010> the

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:36.430 
it's way too big not 100% sure of the

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:40.050 
it's way too big not 100% sure of the
scales<00:05:36.870> but<00:05:37.870> I<00:05:38.320> believe<00:05:39.250> the<00:05:39.460> Millennium

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:40.060 
scales but I believe the Millennium

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:43.170 
scales but I believe the Millennium
Falcon<00:05:40.140> would<00:05:41.140> equate<00:05:41.500> probably<00:05:41.980> to<00:05:42.130> one<00:05:42.400> stud

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:43.180 
Falcon would equate probably to one stud

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:46.520 
Falcon would equate probably to one stud
on<00:05:44.170> the<00:05:44.230> Lego<00:05:45.010> here
