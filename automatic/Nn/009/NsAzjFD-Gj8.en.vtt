00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:08.130
 and a quick idea super easy to do and 

00:00:05.459 --> 00:00:10.650
 that surely you will surprise more 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.540
 of one today we are going to make some 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.999
 chocolate nests that practically you 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:18.330
 then put what you want after 

00:00:14.999 --> 00:00:20.840
 put chocolates for exposing what you can 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:24.990
 put the side as the day of another fact 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:28.730
 you know that this is super easy 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.730
 presence to do because generally 

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:36.079
 and twitter 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:44.239
 I feel good, you know I love you 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.239
 I send you a big hug 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.250
 make these chocolate nests is very 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.230
 easy the only thing we're going to use the 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.019
 chocolate you can use the one you 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.690
 you want it can be dark or it can be 

00:00:55.019 --> 00:01:00.180
 white we are going to occupy a logo 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.360
 completely clean and sachets 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.360
 plastic 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.659
 let's open our chocolate and let's go 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.940
 to make sure we cut it into pieces 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:12.950
 small as I told you, you can use 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:16.420
 anyone as long as it's a 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:16.420
 chocolate that melts 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.500
 let's cut it into small squares 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:37.650
 and we are going to use our bags of 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:40.020
 plastic to get inside and we're going to 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:42.180
 make a knot make sure it is 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.190
 just in the chocolate corner for 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.290
 that can serve us in the next 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:49.940
 step we are going to give him a teddy bear so that 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.940
 our chocolate is not going to come out 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.670
 in the each something more or less like that 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.810
 and as I told you, you can use the 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:10.360
 white chocolate or dark chocolate or 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:10.360
 bitter chocolate the one you like the most 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:28.100
 ok since we have our two bags 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:30.080
 of chocolate we are going to inflate a balloon you 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:32.900
 you decide but I recommend you to be 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:35.890
 as a medium size that is more 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.890
 small how big 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:40.940
 and well let's put our chocolate 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:43.160
 to our microwave oven too 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:44.720
 you could do it in a bain-marie but good 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:49.070
 I feel that in the microwave is much more 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:53.140
 You can quickly start putting me 

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:53.140
 I put it for 30 seconds in 30 seconds 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:58.430
 to go see and check until 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:00.500
 our chocolate is completely 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:02.480
 melted the next step in super 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:05.720
 easy since we're just going to give it a 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:07.970
 chick to our scar bag in 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:11.120
 melted chocolate and we're going to form 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:13.340
 lines and lines and lines on our 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:15.890
 balloon what is important is that these lines 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:18.650
 so they are interspersed with each other to 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:21.830
 that we have something more or less like that and 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:24.020
 effect of like a chocolate nest 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:26.540
 then once you have your 

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:28.310
 so we are going to put it in the fridge is 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:31.810
 important that the refri goal for 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:33.970
 that the chocolate solidifies 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:37.330
 so I'm going to put it in my fridge and 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:42.750
 I'll leave them there about 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:42.750
 10 from 10 to 20 minutes 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:06.180
 ok once we already expected this 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:09.420
 time and the chocolate is completely 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:12.300
 solid you can take a needle or a step 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:14.040
 of borbÃ³ something sharp to break our 

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:16.410
 balloon in this step you should do it with 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:18.930
 very careful and you must make sure that 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:21.720
 the chocolate is completely solid and 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:23.820
 so that we do not get undone so 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:25.919
 everything simply because the balloon and with 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:28.020
 careful alone is going to take off 

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:29.940
 but if it stays stuck in the parts of 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:32.100
 up down with a lot of care 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:34.610
 you can take away the balloon the truth is 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:34.610
 that is not difficult 

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:41.600
 and that's how fast you already have your children 

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:43.340
 I put the ice cream and the 

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:44.870
 truth is that that part was erased 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:47.060
 where I'm putting the ice cream but 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:48.410
 good is super simple and as of teis 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:50.810
 that you can fill it with what you 

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:52.400
 you want to look super coquettish and it's a 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:55.280
 way to change the 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:57.050
 presentation to an ice cream you know that 

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:59.870
 are the little details what they do 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:01.820
 our special days 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:03.290
 and I hope you liked it you know 

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:05.810
 that I send you a big hug more 

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:08.860
 trained and see you in a next 

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:08.860
