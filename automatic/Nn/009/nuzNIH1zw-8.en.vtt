00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:23.560 
make it a organic mixture to feed the

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:32.389 
make it a organic mixture to feed the
trees<00:00:23.800> so

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.520

apricot tree right here you see these

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:41.160 
apricot tree right here you see these
three<00:00:39.030> this<00:00:40.030> one<00:00:40.210> the<00:00:40.329> center<00:00:40.690> is<00:00:40.780> the<00:00:40.899> idea

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:41.170 
three this one the center is the idea

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:42.569 
three this one the center is the idea
one<00:00:41.379> to<00:00:41.530> prune<00:00:41.800> so<00:00:42.040> we're<00:00:42.160> going<00:00:42.250> to<00:00:42.340> prune

00:00:42.569 --> 00:00:42.579 
one to prune so we're going to prune

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:45.569 
one to prune so we're going to prune
this<00:00:42.730> one<00:00:42.940> off<00:00:43.120> it<00:00:43.360> gets<00:00:43.570> a<00:00:43.690> nice<00:00:43.899> room<00:00:44.290> here<00:00:44.739> so

00:00:45.569 --> 00:00:45.579 
this one off it gets a nice room here so

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:48.270 
this one off it gets a nice room here so
these<00:00:45.790> all<00:00:45.969> produce<00:00:46.269> fruit<00:00:46.780> also<00:00:47.620> to<00:00:47.890> over

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:48.280 
these all produce fruit also to over

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:50.130 
these all produce fruit also to over
here<00:00:48.460> you<00:00:48.550> have<00:00:48.579> tooth<00:00:48.879> nice<00:00:49.120> space<00:00:49.510> it's<00:00:49.870> nice

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:50.140 
here you have tooth nice space it's nice

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:52.740 
here you have tooth nice space it's nice
and<00:00:50.170> spaced<00:00:50.620> out<00:00:50.829> evenly<00:00:50.890> and<00:00:51.640> you<00:00:52.149> see<00:00:52.570> as<00:00:52.720> it

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:52.750 
and spaced out evenly and you see as it

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:55.439 
and spaced out evenly and you see as it
comes<00:00:53.110> up<00:00:53.260> there's<00:00:54.010> plenty<00:00:54.220> of<00:00:54.489> room<00:00:54.790> for<00:00:55.089> them

00:00:55.439 --> 00:00:55.449 
comes up there's plenty of room for them

00:00:55.449 --> 00:00:59.060 
comes up there's plenty of room for them
to<00:00:55.570> grow<00:00:55.720> it<00:00:55.989> here<00:00:56.790> see<00:00:57.790> how<00:00:58.000> it<00:00:58.120> cuts<00:00:58.329> across

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
to grow it here see how it cuts across

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.649 
to grow it here see how it cuts across
it<00:01:00.070> wasn't<00:01:00.399> prune<00:01:00.640> right<00:01:00.879> so<00:01:01.089> that<00:01:01.300> one<00:01:01.449> should

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:01.659 
it wasn't prune right so that one should

00:01:01.659 --> 00:01:06.389 
it wasn't prune right so that one should
be<00:01:01.780> pruned<00:01:02.110> like<00:01:03.010> right<00:01:03.280> over<00:01:03.309> here<00:01:05.369> so<00:01:06.369> i

00:01:06.389 --> 00:01:06.399 
be pruned like right over here so i

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:08.969 
be pruned like right over here so i
won't<00:01:06.610> cut<00:01:06.820> across<00:01:07.149> the<00:01:07.720> other<00:01:07.899> plans<00:01:08.350> also

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:08.979 
won't cut across the other plans also

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:11.279 
won't cut across the other plans also
too<00:01:09.310> if<00:01:10.000> you<00:01:10.149> look<00:01:10.420> you'll<00:01:10.690> see<00:01:10.720> this<00:01:11.080> one

00:01:11.279 --> 00:01:11.289 
too if you look you'll see this one

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:15.960 
too if you look you'll see this one
right<00:01:11.500> here<00:01:11.560> are<00:01:12.399> dead<00:01:14.460> you<00:01:15.460> see<00:01:15.700> them<00:01:15.789> right

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:15.970 
right here are dead you see them right

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:19.830 
right here are dead you see them right
there<00:01:16.030> so<00:01:16.750> that<00:01:16.960> one<00:01:17.200> needs<00:01:18.160> to<00:01:18.250> get<00:01:18.460> cut<00:01:18.840> just

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:19.840 
there so that one needs to get cut just

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:21.419 
there so that one needs to get cut just
like<00:01:20.020> the<00:01:20.200> one<00:01:20.350> right<00:01:20.560> next<00:01:20.590> to<00:01:20.979> it<00:01:21.070> see<00:01:21.280> that

00:01:21.419 --> 00:01:21.429 
like the one right next to it see that

00:01:21.429 --> 00:01:22.830 
like the one right next to it see that
one<00:01:21.550> wasn't<00:01:21.670> cut<00:01:21.970> a<00:01:22.000> long<00:01:22.179> time<00:01:22.450> ago<00:01:22.600> and<00:01:22.780> they

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:22.840 
one wasn't cut a long time ago and they

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:24.300 
one wasn't cut a long time ago and they
sure<00:01:23.050> grow<00:01:23.170> up<00:01:23.259> and<00:01:23.530> they<00:01:23.590> take<00:01:23.800> a<00:01:23.830> long<00:01:24.100> time

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:24.310 
sure grow up and they take a long time

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:27.389 
sure grow up and they take a long time
see<00:01:24.970> and<00:01:25.210> then<00:01:25.750> right<00:01:26.200> along<00:01:26.350> this<00:01:26.530> path<00:01:26.950> here

00:01:27.389 --> 00:01:27.399 
see and then right along this path here

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:29.340 
see and then right along this path here
this<00:01:28.210> is<00:01:28.360> really<00:01:28.539> nice<00:01:28.750> you<00:01:28.810> see<00:01:29.200> they're

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:29.350 
this is really nice you see they're

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:32.700 
this is really nice you see they're
spread<00:01:29.740> out<00:01:29.770> very<00:01:30.280> evenly<00:01:31.409> all<00:01:32.409> the<00:01:32.590> way

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:32.710 
spread out very evenly all the way

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:34.139 
spread out very evenly all the way
across<00:01:32.830> and<00:01:33.250> that's<00:01:33.399> the<00:01:33.550> idea<00:01:33.850> you<00:01:34.030> don't

00:01:34.139 --> 00:01:34.149 
across and that's the idea you don't

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:35.910 
across and that's the idea you don't
want<00:01:34.360> to<00:01:34.420> have<00:01:34.539> so<00:01:34.720> many<00:01:34.840> things<00:01:35.200> bound<00:01:35.710> up

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:35.920 
want to have so many things bound up

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.429 
want to have so many things bound up
this<00:01:36.100> like<00:01:36.340> up<00:01:36.549> here<00:01:36.630> between<00:01:37.630> these<00:01:37.960> two<00:01:38.229> but

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:38.439 
this like up here between these two but

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:39.929 
this like up here between these two but
that<00:01:38.619> was<00:01:38.770> just<00:01:38.799> a<00:01:39.040> simple<00:01:39.340> matter<00:01:39.520> of<00:01:39.640> moving

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:39.939 
that was just a simple matter of moving

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:41.999 
that was just a simple matter of moving
them<00:01:40.210> across<00:01:40.420> that<00:01:40.780> way<00:01:40.990> see<00:01:41.350> so<00:01:41.649> they<00:01:41.770> don't

00:01:41.999 --> 00:01:42.009 
them across that way see so they don't

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:43.859 
them across that way see so they don't
cross<00:01:42.250> each<00:01:42.460> other<00:01:42.729> and<00:01:43.000> there's<00:01:43.509> plenty<00:01:43.659> of

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:43.869 
cross each other and there's plenty of

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:49.380 
cross each other and there's plenty of
room<00:01:43.960> in<00:01:44.320> there<00:01:45.600> can<00:01:46.600> you<00:01:46.659> see<00:01:47.020> over<00:01:47.259> here<00:01:48.390> see

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:49.390 
room in there can you see over here see

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:52.920 
room in there can you see over here see
that<00:01:49.600> one<00:01:49.780> that<00:01:50.710> one's<00:01:50.950> a<00:01:51.040> dried<00:01:51.640> 1<00:01:51.939> i'm<00:01:52.840> going

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:52.930 
that one that one's a dried 1 i'm going

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:54.300 
that one that one's a dried 1 i'm going
to<00:01:53.079> go<00:01:53.140> ahead<00:01:53.170> and<00:01:53.290> cut<00:01:53.409> it<00:01:53.680> because<00:01:53.770> it<00:01:54.009> wasn't

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:54.310 
to go ahead and cut it because it wasn't

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:56.730 
to go ahead and cut it because it wasn't
pruned<00:01:54.869> when<00:01:55.869> it<00:01:55.960> should<00:01:56.140> have<00:01:56.170> been<00:01:56.350> it<00:01:56.530> just

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:56.740 
pruned when it should have been it just

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:58.410 
pruned when it should have been it just
takes<00:01:56.920> a<00:01:57.040> long<00:01:57.189> time<00:01:57.250> for<00:01:57.520> it<00:01:57.790> to<00:01:57.820> dry<00:01:58.119> out<00:01:58.270> it

00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:58.420 
takes a long time for it to dry out it

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:06.670 
takes a long time for it to dry out it
takes<00:01:58.570> a<00:01:58.780> lot<00:01:58.930> of<00:01:58.960> energy<00:01:59.140> away

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:06.680 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:10.190 

go<00:02:07.680> chemicals

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
go chemicals

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:16.090 
go chemicals
make<00:02:10.410> earth<00:02:10.770> sing

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:16.100 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.560 

okay<00:02:17.100> so<00:02:17.160> a<00:02:17.430> good<00:02:17.670> rule<00:02:17.730> of<00:02:17.910> thumb<00:02:18.000> is<00:02:18.390> don't

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:18.570 
okay so a good rule of thumb is don't

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:20.300 
okay so a good rule of thumb is don't
let<00:02:18.840> anything<00:02:19.080> you<00:02:19.320> grow<00:02:19.590> right<00:02:19.890> off<00:02:20.010> the<00:02:20.160> main

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
let anything you grow right off the main

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.520 
let anything you grow right off the main
trunk<00:02:20.670> anything<00:02:21.480> going<00:02:21.780> inside<00:02:22.080> the<00:02:22.290> center

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
trunk anything going inside the center

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:23.750 
trunk anything going inside the center
of<00:02:22.620> the<00:02:22.770> tree<00:02:23.010> it's<00:02:23.250> not<00:02:23.370> going<00:02:23.490> to<00:02:23.580> do<00:02:23.730> very

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
of the tree it's not going to do very

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.520 
of the tree it's not going to do very
well<00:02:24.030> it<00:02:24.300> just<00:02:24.330> takes<00:02:24.660> a<00:02:24.750> lot<00:02:24.900> of<00:02:24.930> energy<00:02:25.110> for

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
well it just takes a lot of energy for

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.620 
well it just takes a lot of energy for
the<00:02:25.590> tree<00:02:25.830> like<00:02:26.370> this<00:02:26.400> one<00:02:26.730> in<00:02:26.880> here<00:02:27.090> going<00:02:27.390> out

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
the tree like this one in here going out

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:29.720 
the tree like this one in here going out
of<00:02:27.660> the<00:02:27.780> center<00:02:28.140> somewhere<00:02:28.410> so<00:02:29.280> you<00:02:29.310> clear<00:02:29.700> up

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
of the center somewhere so you clear up

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.430 
of the center somewhere so you clear up
all<00:02:30.030> the<00:02:30.180> center<00:02:30.480> ones<00:02:30.660> including<00:02:31.140> all<00:02:31.290> these

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
all the center ones including all these

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.650 
all the center ones including all these
all<00:02:31.710> these<00:02:31.740> centres<00:02:32.610> ones<00:02:32.820> because<00:02:33.540> they're

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
all these centres ones because they're

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.360 
all these centres ones because they're
going<00:02:33.990> right<00:02:34.170> in<00:02:34.320> the<00:02:34.440> center<00:02:34.770> of<00:02:34.800> tree<00:02:35.130> so

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
going right in the center of tree so

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.690 
going right in the center of tree so
think<00:02:35.610> about<00:02:35.730> when<00:02:36.060> the<00:02:36.150> tree<00:02:36.360> gets<00:02:36.510> full

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
think about when the tree gets full

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.920 
think about when the tree gets full
rightfully<00:02:38.700> there'd<00:02:39.000> be<00:02:39.060> no<00:02:39.210> light<00:02:39.480> in<00:02:39.510> here

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
rightfully there'd be no light in here

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.500 
rightfully there'd be no light in here
and<00:02:40.590> it'll<00:02:40.710> be<00:02:40.830> a<00:02:40.860> waste<00:02:41.100> of<00:02:41.490> energy<00:02:42.270> for<00:02:42.450> the

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
and it'll be a waste of energy for the

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.870 
and it'll be a waste of energy for the
tree<00:02:42.750> so<00:02:43.590> all<00:02:43.740> these<00:02:43.890> centres<00:02:44.220> ones<00:02:44.430> here<00:02:44.730> all

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
tree so all these centres ones here all

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.850 
tree so all these centres ones here all
these<00:02:45.030> little<00:02:45.210> lower<00:02:45.510> center<00:02:46.020> ones<00:02:46.200> see

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
these little lower center ones see

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:48.650 
these little lower center ones see
that's<00:02:47.040> what<00:02:47.160> happens<00:02:47.220> it's<00:02:47.730> grew<00:02:48.000> to<00:02:48.270> try<00:02:48.600> to

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
that's what happens it's grew to try to

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:50.750 
that's what happens it's grew to try to
do<00:02:48.930> it<00:02:49.080> and<00:02:49.230> last<00:02:49.350> year's<00:02:49.560> no<00:02:49.740> light<00:02:49.980> and

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
do it and last year's no light and

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.290 
do it and last year's no light and
shriveled<00:02:51.540> right<00:02:51.720> up<00:02:52.220> so<00:02:53.220> and<00:02:53.580> you<00:02:54.000> show<00:02:54.150> you

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 
shriveled right up so and you show you

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:55.910 
shriveled right up so and you show you
about<00:02:54.390> this<00:02:54.660> level<00:02:55.050> here<00:02:55.230> see<00:02:55.470> you<00:02:55.620> want<00:02:55.830> to

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
about this level here see you want to

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.170 
about this level here see you want to
clean<00:02:56.130> up<00:02:56.250> and<00:02:56.480> bike<00:02:57.480> over<00:02:57.810> here<00:02:57.840> see<00:02:58.800> these

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
clean up and bike over here see these

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:02.210 
clean up and bike over here see these
this<00:03:00.180> was<00:03:00.360> last<00:03:00.570> year's<00:03:01.110> and<00:03:01.290> it<00:03:01.530> dried<00:03:01.860> up<00:03:02.070> and

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
this was last year's and it dried up and

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.280 
this was last year's and it dried up and
this<00:03:02.310> is<00:03:02.490> just<00:03:02.670> this<00:03:02.970> year's<00:03:03.420> it's<00:03:04.080> going<00:03:04.230> to

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
this is just this year's it's going to

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.440 
this is just this year's it's going to
do<00:03:04.380> the<00:03:04.500> same<00:03:04.710> thing<00:03:05.070> so<00:03:05.700> we<00:03:05.820> want<00:03:06.030> to<00:03:06.090> clean<00:03:06.330> it

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
do the same thing so we want to clean it

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.000 
do the same thing so we want to clean it
up<00:03:06.600> right<00:03:06.630> up<00:03:06.960> I<00:03:07.110> beginning<00:03:07.470> to<00:03:07.530> the<00:03:07.590> base<00:03:07.800> of

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
up right up I beginning to the base of

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.040 
up right up I beginning to the base of
it<00:03:08.100> and<00:03:08.310> here's<00:03:08.790> a<00:03:08.910> perfect<00:03:09.150> example<00:03:09.360> not

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:10.050 
it and here's a perfect example not

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:13.370 
it and here's a perfect example not
enough<00:03:10.320> light<00:03:10.670> and<00:03:11.810> it's<00:03:12.810> just<00:03:12.960> shriveled<00:03:13.290> up

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
enough light and it's just shriveled up

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:15.080 
enough light and it's just shriveled up
and<00:03:13.530> won't<00:03:13.770> do<00:03:13.890> well<00:03:14.070> and<00:03:14.310> this<00:03:14.520> particular

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
and won't do well and this particular

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.360 
and won't do well and this particular
one<00:03:15.270> here<00:03:15.540> barely<00:03:15.930> gets<00:03:16.230> enough<00:03:16.500> light<00:03:16.770> so<00:03:16.980> we

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
one here barely gets enough light so we

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:18.800 
one here barely gets enough light so we
leave<00:03:17.700> this<00:03:17.850> upper<00:03:18.209> part<00:03:18.480> because<00:03:18.660> that's

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
leave this upper part because that's

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:20.210 
leave this upper part because that's
going<00:03:18.990> to<00:03:19.050> get<00:03:19.170> light<00:03:19.410> but<00:03:19.620> all<00:03:19.800> these<00:03:19.950> other

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
going to get light but all these other

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.870 
going to get light but all these other
ones<00:03:20.520> are<00:03:20.790> going<00:03:21.630> to<00:03:21.750> be<00:03:21.840> way<00:03:22.020> too<00:03:22.080> low<00:03:22.500> for<00:03:22.880> it

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
ones are going to be way too low for it

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:26.420 
ones are going to be way too low for it
to<00:03:23.970> do<00:03:24.120> anything<00:03:24.620> now<00:03:25.620> here's<00:03:25.890> another<00:03:26.130> thing

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
to do anything now here's another thing

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.460 
to do anything now here's another thing
that<00:03:26.490> you<00:03:26.640> want<00:03:26.910> to<00:03:26.970> learn<00:03:27.150> about<00:03:27.390> right<00:03:28.290> here

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
that you want to learn about right here

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:30.949 
that you want to learn about right here
in<00:03:28.530> this<00:03:28.650> branch<00:03:28.920> a<00:03:29.370> good<00:03:30.300> rule<00:03:30.480> of<00:03:30.510> thumb<00:03:30.630> is

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 
in this branch a good rule of thumb is

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:33.380 
in this branch a good rule of thumb is
anything<00:03:31.290> going<00:03:31.500> down<00:03:31.650> is<00:03:31.950> no<00:03:32.100> good<00:03:32.310> so<00:03:33.300> you

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:33.390 
anything going down is no good so you

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:36.620 
anything going down is no good so you
just<00:03:33.630> clip<00:03:33.959> clip<00:03:34.260> that<00:03:34.610> see<00:03:35.610> and<00:03:35.820> then<00:03:36.150> in<00:03:36.300> here

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:36.630 
just clip clip that see and then in here

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:38.180 
just clip clip that see and then in here
this<00:03:36.810> branch<00:03:37.200> here<00:03:37.470> it's<00:03:37.590> not<00:03:37.709> going<00:03:37.860> to<00:03:37.950> do<00:03:38.070> it

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
this branch here it's not going to do it

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:39.830 
this branch here it's not going to do it
well<00:03:38.520> at<00:03:38.730> all<00:03:38.880> this<00:03:39.060> is<00:03:39.209> not<00:03:39.240> going<00:03:39.480> to<00:03:39.570> get<00:03:39.690> any

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
well at all this is not going to get any

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.449 
well at all this is not going to get any
light<00:03:40.110> sure<00:03:40.470> this<00:03:40.650> is<00:03:40.770> light<00:03:40.950> in<00:03:41.100> here<00:03:41.250> now

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:41.459 
light sure this is light in here now

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:44.030 
light sure this is light in here now
because<00:03:41.700> there's<00:03:41.970> no<00:03:42.120> leaves<00:03:42.450> but<00:03:43.350> the<00:03:43.920> only

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
because there's no leaves but the only

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:45.110 
because there's no leaves but the only
thing<00:03:44.130> that's<00:03:44.400> going<00:03:44.490> to<00:03:44.580> do<00:03:44.670> well<00:03:44.850> is<00:03:45.000> this

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
thing that's going to do well is this

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:46.790 
thing that's going to do well is this
branch<00:03:45.420> out<00:03:45.690> here<00:03:45.990> see<00:03:46.260> this<00:03:46.380> is<00:03:46.530> where<00:03:46.680> he's

branch out here see this is where he's

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:48.440 
branch out here see this is where he's
going<00:03:46.950> to<00:03:47.010> get<00:03:47.100> all<00:03:47.250> the<00:03:47.370> light<00:03:47.580> and<00:03:47.820> this

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450 
going to get all the light and this

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:50.780 
going to get all the light and this

to<00:04:05.400> cut<00:04:05.610> it<00:04:05.930> here's<00:04:06.930> another<00:04:07.170> one<00:04:07.380> going<00:04:07.740> down

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:08.390 
to cut it here's another one going down

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:11.150 
to cut it here's another one going down
in<00:04:09.390> the<00:04:09.630> middle<00:04:09.959> of<00:04:10.020> nowhere<00:04:10.470> not<00:04:10.920> enough

in the middle of nowhere not enough

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.640

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:13.650 
light a lot of energy to grow that and

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:16.430 
light a lot of energy to grow that and
it<00:04:14.250> dried<00:04:14.640> right<00:04:14.880> up<00:04:15.060> see<00:04:16.020> it's<00:04:16.140> no<00:04:16.260> good

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 
it dried right up see it's no good

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.830 
it dried right up see it's no good
here's<00:04:16.980> another<00:04:17.070> one<00:04:17.459> going<00:04:17.880> down<00:04:18.060> find<00:04:18.690> this

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840 
here's another one going down find this

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:21.349 
here's another one going down find this
one<00:04:19.080> it<00:04:19.709> went<00:04:20.010> down<00:04:20.190> then<00:04:20.430> it<00:04:20.549> turned<00:04:20.880> and<00:04:21.239> went

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:21.359 
one it went down then it turned and went

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:23.090 
one it went down then it turned and went
out<00:04:21.690> so<00:04:22.109> now<00:04:22.260> it's<00:04:22.440> getting<00:04:22.590> enough<00:04:22.860> light

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:23.100 
out so now it's getting enough light

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:25.790 
out so now it's getting enough light
over<00:04:23.430> here<00:04:23.460> see<00:04:23.880> that<00:04:24.660> one's<00:04:24.840> okay<00:04:24.960> but<00:04:25.680> these

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800 
over here see that one's okay but these

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:26.840

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:34.220 
tree and they're going to die and I get
enough<00:04:31.200> light<00:04:32.210> you<00:04:33.210> see<00:04:33.420> how<00:04:33.600> nice<00:04:33.810> and<00:04:33.840> airy

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:34.230 
enough light you see how nice and airy

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:36.530 
enough light you see how nice and airy
this<00:04:34.620> whole<00:04:34.830> thing<00:04:35.070> is<00:04:35.250> some<00:04:36.120> of<00:04:36.240> the<00:04:36.300> time

this whole thing is some of the time
sometimes<00:04:36.840> the<00:04:37.260> tips<00:04:37.560> die-offs<00:04:38.070> you<00:04:38.310> just<00:04:38.550> get

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:39.030 
sometimes the tips die-offs you just get

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:44.540 
sometimes the tips die-offs you just get
at<00:04:39.180> the<00:04:39.300> tip<00:04:39.510> like<00:04:40.500> that<00:04:40.710> see<00:04:41.270> and<00:04:43.340> in<00:04:44.340> the

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:44.550 
at the tip like that see and in the

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:46.250 
at the tip like that see and in the
center<00:04:44.820> of<00:04:44.910> the<00:04:45.060> tree<00:04:45.330> up<00:04:45.570> here<00:04:45.630> towards<00:04:46.230> the

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:46.260 
center of the tree up here towards the

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:50.240 
center of the tree up here towards the
top<00:04:46.790> you<00:04:47.790> have<00:04:47.940> more<00:04:48.120> lights<00:04:48.420> tea<00:04:48.810> and<00:04:49.100> you<00:04:50.100> can

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:50.250 
top you have more lights tea and you can

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:52.580 
top you have more lights tea and you can
see<00:04:50.430> it's<00:04:50.640> still<00:04:50.790> perlier<00:04:51.270> e<00:04:51.390> arey<00:04:51.780> the<00:04:52.320> lower

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:52.590 
see it's still perlier e arey the lower

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:54.710 
see it's still perlier e arey the lower
parts<00:04:53.130> are<00:04:53.250> always<00:04:53.460> die<00:04:53.820> out<00:04:54.060> on<00:04:54.300> you<00:04:54.480> so<00:04:54.660> you

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:54.720 
parts are always die out on you so you

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:56.180 
parts are always die out on you so you
might<00:04:54.870> as<00:04:54.960> well<00:04:55.020> save<00:04:55.350> them<00:04:55.470> the<00:04:55.500> energy<00:04:55.950> and

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:56.190 
might as well save them the energy and

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:58.940 
might as well save them the energy and
cut<00:04:56.970> it<00:04:57.090> off<00:04:57.270> like<00:04:57.510> this<00:04:57.660> lower<00:04:57.930> one<00:04:58.260> over<00:04:58.590> here

00:04:58.940 --> 00:04:58.950 
cut it off like this lower one over here

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:02.360 
cut it off like this lower one over here
see<00:04:59.730> it's<00:04:59.850> just<00:05:00.330> dried<00:05:00.630> right<00:05:00.870> out<00:05:01.130> now<00:05:02.130> here's

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:02.370 
see it's just dried right out now here's

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:06.140 
see it's just dried right out now here's
a<00:05:02.430> perfect<00:05:02.670> example<00:05:02.970> of<00:05:04.640> improper<00:05:05.640> pruning<00:05:06.060> or

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:06.150 
a perfect example of improper pruning or

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:08.360 
a perfect example of improper pruning or

been pruned there a long time ago but

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:15.380 
been pruned there a long time ago but
what's<00:05:14.190> happening<00:05:14.550> now<00:05:14.640> he's<00:05:14.880> going<00:05:15.210> right

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:15.390 
what's happening now he's going right

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:17.030 
what's happening now he's going right
into<00:05:15.660> the<00:05:15.870> middle<00:05:15.990> of<00:05:16.200> the<00:05:16.260> tree<00:05:16.650> here<00:05:16.950> it's

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:17.040 
into the middle of the tree here it's

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:18.530

now there could be a little bit of the

now there could be a little bit of the
sea<00:05:21.450> we<00:05:21.600> can<00:05:21.750> maybe<00:05:21.900> move<00:05:22.200> it<00:05:22.410> see<00:05:22.980> what

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:23.190 
sea we can maybe move it see what

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:24.530 
sea we can maybe move it see what
happens<00:05:23.220> this<00:05:23.640> whole<00:05:23.850> branch<00:05:24.090> was<00:05:24.300> going<00:05:24.450> to

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:24.540 
happens this whole branch was going to

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:26.180 
happens this whole branch was going to
come<00:05:24.660> right<00:05:24.840> off<00:05:24.900> anyways<00:05:25.440> he<00:05:25.620> says<00:05:25.830> to<00:05:25.950> waste

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:26.190 
come right off anyways he says to waste

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:29.240 
come right off anyways he says to waste
with<00:05:26.910> the<00:05:27.030> tree<00:05:27.380> so<00:05:28.380> we<00:05:28.410> just<00:05:28.740> clean<00:05:29.040> this<00:05:29.190> up

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:29.250 
with the tree so we just clean this up

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:31.850 
with the tree so we just clean this up
here<00:05:29.820> and<00:05:30.180> this<00:05:30.960> would<00:05:31.110> be<00:05:31.140> much<00:05:31.410> better<00:05:31.440> all

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:31.860 
here and this would be much better all

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:33.350 
here and this would be much better all
the<00:05:31.890> energy<00:05:32.250> is<00:05:32.310> going<00:05:32.400> to<00:05:32.520> go<00:05:32.610> my<00:05:32.760> out<00:05:32.970> here<00:05:33.240> to

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:33.360 
the energy is going to go my out here to

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:35.000 
the energy is going to go my out here to
the<00:05:33.480> to<00:05:33.720> this<00:05:33.900> branch<00:05:34.200> now<00:05:34.530> all<00:05:34.830> these

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:35.010 
the to this branch now all these

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:36.440 
the to this branch now all these
branches<00:05:35.460> are<00:05:35.610> going<00:05:35.730> to<00:05:35.790> produce<00:05:35.970> a<00:05:36.270> lot<00:05:36.420> more

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:36.450 
branches are going to produce a lot more

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:39.110 
branches are going to produce a lot more
not<00:05:37.350> a<00:05:37.380> waste<00:05:37.710> of<00:05:37.860> time<00:05:38.040> and<00:05:38.100> energy<00:05:38.280> and<00:05:38.640> even

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:39.120 
not a waste of time and energy and even

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:40.820 
not a waste of time and energy and even
this<00:05:39.210> one<00:05:39.450> in<00:05:39.570> the<00:05:39.600> center<00:05:39.900> see<00:05:40.530> that<00:05:40.680> one

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:40.830 
this one in the center see that one

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:43.070 
this one in the center see that one
there<00:05:40.980> is<00:05:41.070> dried<00:05:41.370> out<00:05:41.510> if<00:05:42.510> you<00:05:42.660> don't<00:05:42.840> cut

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:43.080 
there is dried out if you don't cut

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:44.690 
there is dried out if you don't cut
these<00:05:43.290> it<00:05:43.770> will<00:05:43.920> spend<00:05:44.190> a<00:05:44.280> lot<00:05:44.430> of<00:05:44.460> energy

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:44.700 
these it will spend a lot of energy

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:47.000 
these it will spend a lot of energy
trying<00:05:45.210> to<00:05:45.360> get<00:05:45.480> it<00:05:45.600> to<00:05:45.690> drop<00:05:45.870> again<00:05:46.440> this<00:05:46.830> one

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:47.010 
trying to get it to drop again this one

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:48.680 
trying to get it to drop again this one
here<00:05:47.190> didn't<00:05:47.520> do<00:05:47.610> well<00:05:47.760> see<00:05:48.060> the<00:05:48.180> tip<00:05:48.390> dried

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:48.690 
here didn't do well see the tip dried

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:52.010 
here didn't do well see the tip dried
out<00:05:48.920> and<00:05:50.030> so<00:05:51.030> now<00:05:51.060> you<00:05:51.270> have<00:05:51.510> this<00:05:51.630> as<00:05:51.840> much

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:52.020 
out and so now you have this as much

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:54.260 
out and so now you have this as much
bearing<00:05:52.490> the<00:05:53.490> thing<00:05:53.730> you<00:05:53.850> have<00:05:53.970> to<00:05:54.000> remember

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:54.270 
bearing the thing you have to remember

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:57.560 
bearing the thing you have to remember
about<00:05:54.990> pruning<00:05:55.350> is<00:05:55.650> that<00:05:56.390> people<00:05:57.390> generally

00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:57.570 
about pruning is that people generally

00:05:57.570 --> 00:06:00.290 
about pruning is that people generally
over<00:05:58.200> prone<00:05:58.530> see<00:05:59.160> so<00:05:59.670> they<00:05:59.820> don't<00:06:00.000> really<00:06:00.030> know

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:00.300 
over prone see so they don't really know

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:02.180 
over prone see so they don't really know
what<00:06:00.510> what<00:06:00.810> their<00:06:00.990> pruning<00:06:01.380> for<00:06:01.620> some<00:06:01.860> people

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:02.190 
what what their pruning for some people

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:05.450 
what what their pruning for some people
pruned<00:06:02.490> for<00:06:03.270> our<00:06:03.600> looks<00:06:04.050> now<00:06:04.830> we're<00:06:05.010> pruning<00:06:05.370> a

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:05.460 
pruned for our looks now we're pruning a

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:07.640 
pruned for our looks now we're pruning a
fruit<00:06:05.730> tree<00:06:05.970> so<00:06:06.210> basically<00:06:06.960> we're<00:06:07.140> pruning<00:06:07.530> it

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:07.650 
fruit tree so basically we're pruning it

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:10.580 
fruit tree so basically we're pruning it
this<00:06:07.800> is<00:06:07.980> a<00:06:08.010> bad<00:06:08.250> branch<00:06:08.550> right<00:06:08.790> here<00:06:09.440> so<00:06:10.440> we're

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:10.590 
this is a bad branch right here so we're

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:12.200 
this is a bad branch right here so we're
basically<00:06:10.770> pruning<00:06:11.490> or<00:06:11.550> fruit<00:06:11.790> tree<00:06:12.000> for

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:12.210 
basically pruning or fruit tree for

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:15.140 
basically pruning or fruit tree for
production<00:06:12.840> okay<00:06:13.740> so<00:06:14.400> we<00:06:14.520> want<00:06:14.760> it<00:06:14.850> to<00:06:14.880> produce

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:15.150 
production okay so we want it to produce

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:17.560 
production okay so we want it to produce
more<00:06:15.600> fruit<00:06:15.960> it's<00:06:16.140> just<00:06:16.290> like<00:06:16.410> we're<00:06:16.590> roses

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:17.570 
more fruit it's just like we're roses

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:19.760 
more fruit it's just like we're roses
