00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:37.750
 that's why we do not want to win for the three 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:37.750
 points we are going from forceful 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:43.600
 a great match a very strong match 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:46.300
 as always are the classics a match 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:49.059
 Communist also a lot of tradition 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:52.059
 then we hope it's a match 

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:52.059
 hard-fought 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.180
 i 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:10.250
 the conscience is to make us prepare 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:12.350
 since January they are more than six times 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:16.430
 preparation for the entire season of 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:21.310
 world of berlin until something is extra 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:21.310
 for this game nothing but yourself 

00:01:21.429 --> 00:01:29.299
 thinking what you want to do the diary 

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:32.030
 Well , the more prepared when 

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:33.799
 games we can find the 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:35.090
 better the time with which it was considered 

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:36.709
 one more team read the same the 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:38.869
 corporates equal and if strauss kahn 

00:01:36.709 --> 00:01:40.250
 closes the repetition the same as 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:42.099
 breathed really different if it comes out 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:44.689
 totally different is a party and 

00:01:42.099 --> 00:01:49.030
 changes completely is a continuation 

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:49.030
 It is excellent but to be the same 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:58.610
 back they are strong they are fast but 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:02.090
 I believe that unlike in past years 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:04.440
 to this they have still been down their 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:09.009
 goiÃ¡s performance t 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:10.690
 they have the defense that after four years 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:13.750
 normal 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:16.110
 I'm wrong about his own offense 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.110
 as well 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.260
 Y 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:40.350
 You can read more of how the final 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:40.350
 in pairs 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:44.380
 a difficult game 

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:55.870
 also is always electric is a 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:57.970
 team that we fought together I did not make them 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:00.220
 street we hire to lift them from all 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:02.620
 the team to that fellow diego and 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:04.540
 we are always built, no 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:07.000
 we are not a team of talents 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:10.270
 individual is not our team that 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:13.660
 all look or all or all broken 

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:15.070
 I think that the friend we have there is 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:17.620
 I work the first job we have 

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:22.440
 had all these last five years and 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:22.440
 this union that we are formed 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.620
 we are more than more than a team we are 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:30.000
 fernando all there I think that this is 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:30.000
 a very high point of your forehead 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:35.980
 yes 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:39.880
 As always , I think it's the best 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:42.150
 Mexican hobby always conditions the 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:45.580
 good in the bad rather you go bad 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:47.500
 it would be proven that if we were to touch 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:50.770
 populate to be in Puebla if it touches us 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:53.950
 the task and it's in Monterrey and it's not 

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:56.200
 we have a house but find a stadium that 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:57.879
 it's that we're going 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:00.099
 to say it's a position 

00:03:57.879 --> 00:04:02.060
 conditional I think it's going to always take 

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:06.910
 can the wire net bierce functions 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:10.870
 good nothing 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:10.870
 america of mexico
