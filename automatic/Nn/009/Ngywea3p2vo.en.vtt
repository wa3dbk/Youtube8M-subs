00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
so let's get started the first step is

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.620

step you're going to need to make your
nails<00:00:29.369> even<00:00:29.820> so<00:00:30.480> you<00:00:30.539> can<00:00:30.900> either<00:00:31.080> trim<00:00:31.380> them

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
nails even so you can either trim them

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.280 
nails even so you can either trim them
as<00:00:32.520> you<00:00:32.610> can<00:00:32.759> see<00:00:32.880> mine<00:00:33.000> are<00:00:33.120> very<00:00:33.270> uneven<00:00:33.960> so<00:00:34.260> I

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
as you can see mine are very uneven so I

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.620 
as you can see mine are very uneven so I
just<00:00:34.739> clipped<00:00:35.070> mine<00:00:35.340> you<00:00:35.969> can<00:00:36.149> also<00:00:36.329> use<00:00:36.600> a

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
just clipped mine you can also use a

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.869 
just clipped mine you can also use a
nail<00:00:37.050> file<00:00:37.380> to<00:00:37.590> make<00:00:37.710> some<00:00:37.980> flat-topped

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
nail file to make some flat-topped

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:47.630 
nail file to make some flat-topped
I<00:00:44.539> know<00:00:45.539> I<00:00:45.750> could<00:00:46.170> really<00:00:46.469> use<00:00:46.590> a<00:00:46.829> pedicure<00:00:47.250> but

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
I know I could really use a pedicure but

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.819 
I know I could really use a pedicure but
here<00:00:48.180> what<00:00:48.390> they<00:00:48.480> look<00:00:48.629> like<00:00:48.660> after<00:00:48.960> I<00:00:49.170> trimmed

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
here what they look like after I trimmed

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.460 
here what they look like after I trimmed
them

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:52.470 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:55.740 

if<00:00:53.470> you<00:00:53.680> have<00:00:53.860> an<00:00:53.980> unsteady<00:00:54.610> or<00:00:54.850> shaky<00:00:55.450> hand

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:55.750 
if you have an unsteady or shaky hand

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:57.120 
if you have an unsteady or shaky hand
when<00:00:55.960> painting<00:00:56.410> I<00:00:56.560> definitely<00:00:56.890> recommend

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:57.130 
when painting I definitely recommend

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:59.280 
when painting I definitely recommend
putting<00:00:57.460> tape<00:00:57.850> around<00:00:58.390> your<00:00:58.690> nails<00:00:58.870> so<00:00:59.140> there

00:00:59.280 --> 00:00:59.290 
putting tape around your nails so there

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:02.400 
putting tape around your nails so there
will<00:00:59.410> not<00:00:59.560> get<00:00:59.770> excess<00:01:00.580> polish<00:01:01.000> around<00:01:01.510> your

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:02.410 
will not get excess polish around your

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:05.100 
will not get excess polish around your
arm<00:01:02.620> toe<00:01:02.920> but<00:01:03.580> if<00:01:03.700> you<00:01:03.850> have<00:01:04.059> a<00:01:04.090> steady<00:01:04.510> enough

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:05.110 
arm toe but if you have a steady enough

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:07.710 
arm toe but if you have a steady enough
hand<00:01:05.350> like<00:01:05.500> I<00:01:05.680> do<00:01:05.740> tape<00:01:06.700> is<00:01:06.850> not<00:01:06.880> necessary<00:01:07.510> but

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:07.720 
hand like I do tape is not necessary but

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.450 
hand like I do tape is not necessary but
for<00:01:07.900> this<00:01:07.990> for<00:01:08.680> the<00:01:08.770> big<00:01:08.890> toe<00:01:09.040> I'm<00:01:09.130> just<00:01:09.310> going

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:09.460 
for this for the big toe I'm just going

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:11.010 
for this for the big toe I'm just going
to<00:01:09.490> show<00:01:09.640> you<00:01:09.670> how<00:01:09.940> tape<00:01:10.240> would<00:01:10.480> work<00:01:10.690> if<00:01:10.870> you

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:11.020 
to show you how tape would work if you

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:20.190 
to show you how tape would work if you
need<00:01:11.200> it

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:20.200 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.720 

so<00:01:21.200> as<00:01:21.320> you<00:01:21.440> can<00:01:21.530> see<00:01:21.710> the<00:01:21.830> tape<00:01:22.040> does<00:01:22.400> help

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:22.730 
so as you can see the tape does help

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:23.620 
so as you can see the tape does help
even<00:01:23.030> though<00:01:23.090> you<00:01:23.180> haven't<00:01:23.360> really<00:01:23.540> seen

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:23.630 
even though you haven't really seen

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:25.900 
even though you haven't really seen
anything<00:01:23.810> yet<00:01:23.990> but<00:01:24.620> I'm<00:01:24.770> doing<00:01:25.070> sideways

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:25.910 
anything yet but I'm doing sideways

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:27.370 
anything yet but I'm doing sideways
jokes<00:01:26.270> you<00:01:26.360> can<00:01:26.390> do<00:01:26.540> up<00:01:26.660> and<00:01:26.750> down<00:01:26.810> strokes<00:01:27.110> if

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:27.380 
jokes you can do up and down strokes if

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:29.110 
jokes you can do up and down strokes if
that<00:01:27.530> floats<00:01:27.770> your<00:01:27.890> boat<00:01:27.950> make<00:01:28.940> sure<00:01:29.060> you

polish<00:01:30.830> on<00:01:31.040> the<00:01:31.610> brush<00:01:31.850> because<00:01:32.210> you<00:01:32.330> can

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:32.540 
polish on the brush because you can

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:35.020 
polish on the brush because you can
create<00:01:32.810> little<00:01:33.140> globs<00:01:33.440> so<00:01:34.280> just<00:01:34.550> be<00:01:34.670> careful

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.030

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:36.860

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.160 
with this and as you can tell the tape
is<00:01:37.070> working<00:01:37.580> and<00:01:37.790> it'll<00:01:38.600> make<00:01:38.750> it<00:01:38.840> look<00:01:38.930> what

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:39.170 
is working and it'll make it look what

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:41.380 
is working and it'll make it look what
mate<00:01:39.470> way<00:01:39.830> cleaner<00:01:40.100> if<00:01:40.490> your<00:01:40.700> hand<00:01:41.000> is<00:01:41.150> more

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:41.390

unsteady<00:01:43.360> now<00:01:44.360> I<00:01:44.390> am<00:01:44.660> peeling<00:01:45.110> off<00:01:45.380> the<00:01:45.410> tape

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920 
unsteady now I am peeling off the tape

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:47.500 
unsteady now I am peeling off the tape
and<00:01:46.160> I'm<00:01:46.250> getting<00:01:46.460> a<00:01:46.550> very<00:01:46.700> clean<00:01:46.970> look<00:01:47.000> if<00:01:47.420> I

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:47.510 
and I'm getting a very clean look if I

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:48.880 
and I'm getting a very clean look if I
add<00:01:47.660> if<00:01:47.870> the<00:01:47.960> tape<00:01:48.140> acts<00:01:48.320> and<00:01:48.440> I<00:01:48.470> covered<00:01:48.710> up

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 
add if the tape acts and I covered up

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:50.800 
add if the tape acts and I covered up
par<00:01:49.070> the<00:01:49.190> nail<00:01:49.370> I<00:01:49.580> can<00:01:50.030> easily<00:01:50.330> get<00:01:50.479> that<00:01:50.630> but

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810 
par the nail I can easily get that but

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:52.719 
par the nail I can easily get that but
if<00:01:50.900> you<00:01:50.990> can't<00:01:51.260> read<00:01:51.590> tape<00:01:51.800> the<00:01:52.070> tape<00:01:52.280> back<00:01:52.460> on

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:52.729 
if you can't read tape the tape back on

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:55.510 
if you can't read tape the tape back on
and<00:01:53.000> it<00:01:53.840> should<00:01:54.080> work<00:01:54.260> just<00:01:54.440> fine<00:01:54.830> so<00:01:55.280> that's

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520 
and it should work just fine so that's

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:04.420 
and it should work just fine so that's
what<00:01:55.729> that<00:01:55.880> nail<00:01:56.300> turned<00:01:56.690> out<00:01:56.870> like

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:04.430 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:08.359
