I<00:04:41.750> think<00:04:42.750> I<00:04:42.810> much<00:04:42.990> figured<00:04:43.380> out<00:04:43.560> now<00:04:43.590> actually

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:44.220 
I think I much figured out now actually

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:48.530 
I think I much figured out now actually
wait<00:04:44.880> is<00:04:44.970> that<00:04:46.880> you<00:04:47.880> say<00:04:48.060> it's<00:04:48.180> not<00:04:48.270> floating

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:48.540 
wait is that you say it's not floating

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:54.710 
wait is that you say it's not floating
it's<00:04:49.020> not<00:04:49.199> okay<00:04:49.590> that's<00:04:49.800> cool<00:04:53.270> i've<00:04:54.270> added<00:04:54.479> the

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:54.720 
it's not okay that's cool i've added the

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:56.270 
it's not okay that's cool i've added the
ramp<00:04:54.960> in<00:04:55.139> so<00:04:55.290> no<00:04:55.440> it's<00:04:55.560> not<00:04:55.590> actually<00:04:55.770> floating

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:56.280 
ramp in so no it's not actually floating

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:59.750 
ramp in so no it's not actually floating
because<00:04:56.430> i<00:04:56.460> think<00:04:56.610> it<00:04:56.760> was<00:04:56.880> before<00:04:57.090> and<00:04:58.760> after
