now<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:57.090> second<00:00:57.539> question<00:00:57.690> it's<00:00:58.109> kind<00:00:58.260> of<00:00:58.289> a

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
now the second question it's kind of a

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.830 
now the second question it's kind of a
tricky<00:00:58.890> question<00:00:59.039> it<00:00:59.489> is<00:00:59.670> do<00:01:00.149> you<00:01:00.210> think<00:01:00.420> that

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
tricky question it is do you think that

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.650 
tricky question it is do you think that
books<00:01:01.260> should<00:01:01.590> have<00:01:01.770> age<00:01:02.100> limits<00:01:02.910> my<00:01:03.180> opinion

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
books should have age limits my opinion

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.880 
books should have age limits my opinion
is<00:01:03.809> kind<00:01:04.140> of<00:01:04.460> it's<00:01:05.460> yes<00:01:05.909> you<00:01:06.630> as<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:07.470> publisher

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
is kind of it's yes you as the publisher

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.219 
is kind of it's yes you as the publisher
do<00:01:08.280> not<00:01:08.520> have<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:09.119> right<00:01:09.330> to<00:01:09.570> tell<00:01:09.810> anybody

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
do not have the right to tell anybody

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.920 
do not have the right to tell anybody
anybody<00:01:11.159> what<00:01:11.610> they<00:01:11.640> can<00:01:12.030> and<00:01:12.210> cannot<00:01:12.510> read<00:01:12.750> it

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
anybody what they can and cannot read it

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.980 
anybody what they can and cannot read it
but<00:01:13.110> I<00:01:13.439> do<00:01:13.560> think<00:01:13.740> that<00:01:14.220> it<00:01:14.460> is<00:01:14.490> a<00:01:14.610> good<00:01:14.970> idea<00:01:15.450> to

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
but I do think that it is a good idea to

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.390 
but I do think that it is a good idea to
kind<00:01:16.170> of<00:01:16.290> put<00:01:16.470> a<00:01:16.500> sticker<00:01:16.830> on<00:01:16.950> there<00:01:17.100> that<00:01:17.220> says

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
kind of put a sticker on there that says

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.700 
kind of put a sticker on there that says
mature<00:01:17.850> content<00:01:18.450> and<00:01:18.630> so<00:01:19.049> that<00:01:19.229> way<00:01:19.409> the

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
mature content and so that way the

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.679 
mature content and so that way the
parent<00:01:20.009> can<00:01:20.159> be<00:01:20.250> like<00:01:20.400> you<00:01:20.759> know<00:01:20.880> what<00:01:21.090> Johnny

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
parent can be like you know what Johnny

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.240 
parent can be like you know what Johnny
boy<00:01:21.900> I<00:01:22.170> don't<00:01:22.229> think<00:01:22.560> you're<00:01:22.680> ready<00:01:22.890> to<00:01:23.070> read

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
boy I don't think you're ready to read

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.850 
boy I don't think you're ready to read
this<00:01:23.430> one<00:01:23.640> quite<00:01:23.939> yet<00:01:24.240> but<00:01:24.689> maybe<00:01:24.990> Susan<00:01:25.380> is

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
this one quite yet but maybe Susan is

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.890 
this one quite yet but maybe Susan is
ready<00:01:26.430> to<00:01:26.640> read<00:01:26.820> it<00:01:26.909> and<00:01:27.030> so<00:01:27.119> I<00:01:27.299> think<00:01:27.479> that<00:01:27.720> it

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
ready to read it and so I think that it

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.050 
ready to read it and so I think that it
is<00:01:28.020> good<00:01:28.350> for<00:01:28.590> the<00:01:28.890> parents<00:01:29.340> and<00:01:29.430> for<00:01:29.490> kind<00:01:30.000> of

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
is good for the parents and for kind of

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.359 
is good for the parents and for kind of
self-evaluation<00:01:30.930> but<00:01:31.320> I<00:01:31.500> do<00:01:31.619> not<00:01:31.890> think<00:01:32.159> that

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
self-evaluation but I do not think that

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.219 
self-evaluation but I do not think that
it<00:01:32.490> should<00:01:32.700> be<00:01:32.750> restricting<00:01:33.750> alright<00:01:34.020> so

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
it should be restricting alright so

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.380 
it should be restricting alright so
question<00:01:34.560> three<00:01:34.590> is<00:01:35.070> what<00:01:35.490> was<00:01:35.850> your<00:01:36.000> favorite

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:27.450 
children's book and just overall from me
the<00:05:25.510> biggest<00:05:25.720> theme<00:05:26.200> that<00:05:26.770> I<00:05:26.830> think<00:05:26.950> I<00:05:27.220> picked

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:27.460 
the biggest theme that I think I picked

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:30.090 
the biggest theme that I think I picked
up<00:05:27.640> from<00:05:28.210> my<00:05:28.539> childhood<00:05:29.020> reading<00:05:29.440> was<00:05:29.650> to<00:05:29.830> be

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:30.100 
up from my childhood reading was to be

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:34.170 
up from my childhood reading was to be
brave<00:05:30.880> to<00:05:31.240> be<00:05:31.570> courageous<00:05:32.200> and<00:05:32.680> I<00:05:33.430> think<00:05:34.060> it's

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:34.180 
brave to be courageous and I think it's

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:36.210 
brave to be courageous and I think it's
because<00:05:34.479> like<00:05:34.660> in<00:05:34.870> all<00:05:35.260> of<00:05:35.500> the<00:05:35.620> stories

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:36.220 
because like in all of the stories

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:38.850 
because like in all of the stories
it's<00:05:36.550> always<00:05:37.080> somebody<00:05:38.080> goes<00:05:38.470> on<00:05:38.680> like<00:05:38.830> a

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:38.860 
it's always somebody goes on like a

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:40.980 
it's always somebody goes on like a
quest<00:05:39.310> or<00:05:39.640> an<00:05:39.729> adventure<00:05:40.270> and<00:05:40.479> at<00:05:40.570> the<00:05:40.660> end<00:05:40.840> of

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:40.990 
quest or an adventure and at the end of

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:43.409 
quest or an adventure and at the end of
the<00:05:41.050> day<00:05:41.289> it<00:05:41.560> requires<00:05:42.039> them<00:05:42.340> to<00:05:42.520> be<00:05:42.640> brave<00:05:43.000> in

00:05:43.409 --> 00:05:43.419 
the day it requires them to be brave in

00:05:43.419 --> 00:05:45.120 
the day it requires them to be brave in
a<00:05:43.630> lot<00:05:43.840> of<00:05:43.990> different<00:05:44.350> ways<00:05:44.500> and<00:05:44.770> I<00:05:44.860> think<00:05:44.890> I

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:45.130 
a lot of different ways and I think I

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:46.650 
a lot of different ways and I think I
picked<00:05:45.340> that<00:05:45.430> up<00:05:45.490> when<00:05:46.000> I<00:05:46.030> was<00:05:46.210> a<00:05:46.240> little<00:05:46.539> kid

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:46.660 
picked that up when I was a little kid

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:47.940 
picked that up when I was a little kid
and<00:05:46.810> I<00:05:46.900> think<00:05:47.080> I<00:05:47.169> always<00:05:47.380> kind<00:05:47.560> of<00:05:47.650> know<00:05:47.740> it's

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:47.950 
and I think I always kind of know it's

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:49.650 
and I think I always kind of know it's
like<00:05:48.070> yeah<00:05:48.250> you<00:05:48.550> know<00:05:48.789> what<00:05:49.000> I<00:05:49.150> don't<00:05:49.390> want<00:05:49.570> to
