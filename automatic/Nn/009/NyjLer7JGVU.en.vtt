00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:10.679
 buenos aires 1968 2 fundamental and opposite facts happened at that time 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.269
 on the one hand the military government of Juan Carlos onganía on the other the institute 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:15.990
 di tella 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.340
 it is possible that in the same historical moment this has happened these two 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:20.619
 things 

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:21.520
 That's how it went 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:25.210
 and it was then that in the institute di tella the glorious institute di tella 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:27.599
 an artist called roberto plate 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:32.169
 now presents an unusual work for the then public toilets 

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:36.129
 that made the one that put inside and that tuto public bathroom women and men 

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:37.450
 ladies and gentlemen 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:42.470
 but did not count plate with the cunning of the present audience that began although 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:45.070
 The bathrooms should be used as they should be used 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:45.960
 write 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.170
 graffiti 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:51.730
 and they began to put absolutely of all and of another that segovia and another that 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:54.229
 wrote and so they went from the most 

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:55.350
 soeces 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:56.640
 Advanced ibarra 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.790
 that puts the public baths up to criticism terrible criticism 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:04.710
 military government of Juan Carlos Onganía when he heard the seal was armed the 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:05.840
 great bolonti 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:07.610
 and before that somehow 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:09.950
 deterioration decay in the face of pressure 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:13.920
 from the institute di tella it seems to me that this is so important that it happened and this 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.920
 hora de roberto plate which is an honor 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.280
 annan 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.710
 Vicente del Bosque 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:30.750
 travel to cities of the last century of 68 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.460
 and that institute that brings together all the arts 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.260
 at that time it is the place par excellence one by one 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.729
 in the theater of contemporary or experimental authors or 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:44.750
 as 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:47.190
 concert 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:50.190
 oppositions like the one we're talking about 

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:55.460
 my experience 68 I once witnessed the city 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:00.410
 name was like him the palios 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.710
 my work consists simply of a quarter 

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:10.809
 which are a trailer of the other 

00:02:10.809 --> 00:02:13.879
 difficult in signaling the silhouette 

00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:16.249
 it gives more and gentlemen 

00:02:16.249 --> 00:02:19.639
 one could penetrate to and open the cinema door 

00:02:20.419 --> 00:02:25.139
 I felt like two months and we have to wash our hands let's say it or dust 

00:02:25.139 --> 00:02:27.029
 enhance your nose 

00:02:27.029 --> 00:02:30.289
 but he did not have any sanitary facility 

00:02:30.289 --> 00:02:34.399
 and then this surface extinction extract that those walls the 

00:02:34.399 --> 00:02:35.729
 interiors 

00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:37.399
 and there were no demonstrations 

00:02:37.399 --> 00:02:40.939
 the graphic is well understood especially after the dictatorship 

00:02:41.999 --> 00:02:43.039
 against 

00:02:43.039 --> 00:02:46.039
 the military 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:50.869
 the exhibition lasted from Friday to Saturday 

00:02:50.869 --> 00:02:55.519
 fracture scare another day and says the next day was censored kid who did not 

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:57.659
 you can give 

00:02:57.659 --> 00:02:59.469
 from each side the force airplane 

00:02:59.469 --> 00:03:02.469
 a policeman as if instead of the desert 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:09.529
 after all the other solidarity artists 

00:03:09.529 --> 00:03:11.959
 aa this censorship 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:13.029
 my job 

00:03:13.029 --> 00:03:16.299
 they took out all the works environment of the institute says the art 

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:19.879
 and they're going outside and grab 

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:22.689
 big bonfires being solidary 

00:03:22.689 --> 00:03:24.769
 to the freedom of 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:27.949
 and from there we did not go from Argentina 

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:30.399
 like many others of my generation 

00:03:30.399 --> 00:03:33.399
 we return the moment democracy monumental center in egypt 

00:03:35.139 --> 00:03:37.819
 I'm plastering the one in the bathrooms 

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:40.319
 and those common ticket to whom about 1 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:43.159
 you like it or you do not like it but you can not get over it I have 

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:46.159
 consciousness that and I have 

00:03:49.999 --> 00:03:52.999
