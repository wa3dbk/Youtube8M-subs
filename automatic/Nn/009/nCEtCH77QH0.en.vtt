this little feature up here inside this
ice<00:01:43.000> machine<00:01:43.390> this<00:01:43.600> little<00:01:44.260> vent<00:01:44.710> tube<00:01:45.070> it

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:45.400 
ice machine this little vent tube it

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:48.120 
ice machine this little vent tube it
leads<00:01:46.270> to<00:01:46.390> a<00:01:46.600> future<00:01:46.930> that<00:01:47.110> we<00:01:47.229> call<00:01:47.470> loom<00:01:47.920> ice

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.130 
leads to a future that we call loom ice

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:51.690 
leads to a future that we call loom ice
and<00:01:48.760> looma<00:01:49.720> ice<00:01:49.869> is<00:01:50.200> in<00:01:50.530> the<00:01:50.619> ozone<00:01:51.130> machine

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:51.700 
and looma ice is in the ozone machine

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.060 
and looma ice is in the ozone machine
built<00:01:52.119> into<00:01:52.420> our<00:01:52.570> ice<00:01:52.690> machine<00:01:53.200> so<00:01:53.410> what<00:01:53.830> we<00:01:53.950> do

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:54.070 
built into our ice machine so what we do

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:57.840 
built into our ice machine so what we do
is<00:01:54.190> we<00:01:54.340> circulate<00:01:55.140> ozone<00:01:56.140> air<00:01:56.619> through<00:01:57.550> this

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:57.850 
is we circulate ozone air through this

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:01.050 
is we circulate ozone air through this
food<00:01:58.590> area<00:01:59.590> and<00:01:59.920> what<00:02:00.490> we're<00:02:00.610> doing<00:02:00.850> is<00:02:00.910> we're

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:01.060 
food area and what we're doing is we're

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.540 
food area and what we're doing is we're
basically<00:02:01.590> sanitizing<00:02:02.590> the<00:02:02.619> air<00:02:03.010> this

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:03.550 
basically sanitizing the air this

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:05.880 
basically sanitizing the air this

machine<00:02:06.369> you<00:02:07.330> have<00:02:07.479> your<00:02:07.660> on/off<00:02:08.110> button<00:02:08.500> here

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:08.770 
machine you have your on/off button here

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:10.229 
machine you have your on/off button here
and<00:02:08.860> you<00:02:08.950> have<00:02:09.130> your<00:02:09.160> clean<00:02:09.550> button<00:02:09.940> here<00:02:10.149> and

and you have your clean button here and

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:11.699 
and you have your clean button here and
you<00:02:10.360> can<00:02:10.509> basically<00:02:10.690> ignore<00:02:10.929> this<00:02:11.380> if<00:02:11.590> you

00:02:11.699 --> 00:02:11.709 
you can basically ignore this if you

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:13.380 
you can basically ignore this if you
want<00:02:12.040> to<00:02:12.250> if<00:02:12.489> you<00:02:12.580> just<00:02:12.730> wants<00:02:12.940> ice<00:02:13.090> cream<00:02:13.120> to

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
want to if you just wants ice cream to

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.180 
want to if you just wants ice cream to
run<00:02:13.570> you<00:02:13.720> let<00:02:13.900> it<00:02:13.989> run<00:02:14.230> if<00:02:14.860> you<00:02:14.950> want<00:02:14.980> to

run you let it run if you want to

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:16.500 
run you let it run if you want to
interact<00:02:15.400> with<00:02:15.730> this<00:02:15.790> and<00:02:15.970> understand<00:02:16.390> what

filter needs to be cleaned so it'll

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:51.600 
filter needs to be cleaned so it'll
prompt<00:02:50.380> you<00:02:50.500> and<00:02:50.530> tell<00:02:50.890> you<00:02:51.100> when<00:02:51.430> it<00:02:51.580> needs

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:51.610 
prompt you and tell you when it needs

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:54.960 
prompt you and tell you when it needs

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
this stuff taken care of once we get

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:57.720 
this stuff taken care of once we get
into<00:02:55.209> this<00:02:55.299> control<00:02:55.780> board<00:02:55.989> we<00:02:56.590> can<00:02:56.799> manage<00:02:57.340> a

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
into this control board we can manage a

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:02.039 
into this control board we can manage a
lot<00:02:58.480> of<00:02:59.250> your<00:03:00.250> expenses<00:03:01.030> such<00:03:01.239> as<00:03:01.450> energy<00:03:01.750> and

00:03:02.039 --> 00:03:02.049 
lot of your expenses such as energy and

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:04.560 
lot of your expenses such as energy and
water<00:03:02.470> expenses<00:03:03.250> via<00:03:03.489> this<00:03:03.670> control<00:03:04.090> board<00:03:04.299> so

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:04.570 
water expenses via this control board so

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:07.740 
water expenses via this control board so
we'll<00:03:05.049> more<00:03:05.230> in<00:03:05.320> our<00:03:05.440> ice<00:03:05.640> program<00:03:06.640> mode<00:03:06.940> we

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:07.750 
we'll more in our ice program mode we

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:09.810 
we'll more in our ice program mode we
can<00:03:07.780> actually<00:03:08.410> program<00:03:08.739> this<00:03:09.160> ice<00:03:09.400> machine

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:09.820 
can actually program this ice machine

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:13.770 
can actually program this ice machine
now<00:03:10.060> to<00:03:10.870> operate<00:03:11.680> certain<00:03:12.400> times<00:03:12.910> of<00:03:13.329> the<00:03:13.570> day

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780 
now to operate certain times of the day

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:15.690 
now to operate certain times of the day
or<00:03:14.290> you<00:03:14.500> can<00:03:14.650> have<00:03:14.829> it<00:03:14.980> off<00:03:15.130> let's<00:03:15.400> say<00:03:15.549> you're

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
or you can have it off let's say you're

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:17.400 
or you can have it off let's say you're
closed<00:03:16.000> on<00:03:16.209> Sundays<00:03:16.660> and<00:03:16.810> Mondays<00:03:17.140> and<00:03:17.350> you

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:17.410 
closed on Sundays and Mondays and you

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:18.569 
closed on Sundays and Mondays and you
just<00:03:17.530> don't<00:03:17.709> need<00:03:17.860> the<00:03:17.920> ice<00:03:18.040> machine<00:03:18.400> to<00:03:18.489> be

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:18.579 
just don't need the ice machine to be

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:20.729 
just don't need the ice machine to be
making<00:03:18.880> ice<00:03:19.030> then<00:03:19.329> we<00:03:19.870> can<00:03:20.019> actually<00:03:20.170> cycle

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:20.739 
making ice then we can actually cycle

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:22.620 
making ice then we can actually cycle
ice<00:03:20.890> machine<00:03:21.250> completely<00:03:21.610> off<00:03:22.060> through<00:03:22.510> this

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:22.630 
ice machine completely off through this

ice machine completely off through this
control<00:03:23.049> on<00:03:23.230> any<00:03:23.799> day<00:03:24.100> of<00:03:24.130> the<00:03:24.280> week<00:03:24.459> you<00:03:24.489> can

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:24.730 
control on any day of the week you can

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:27.030 
control on any day of the week you can
even<00:03:24.850> set<00:03:25.209> ice<00:03:25.390> usage<00:03:26.019> so<00:03:26.320> say<00:03:26.680> this<00:03:26.890> ice

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.040 
even set ice usage so say this ice

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:28.830 
even set ice usage so say this ice
machine<00:03:27.370> will<00:03:27.459> make<00:03:27.579> 500<00:03:28.060> pounds<00:03:28.329> of<00:03:28.390> ice<00:03:28.540> on

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 
machine will make 500 pounds of ice on

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:31.110 
machine will make 500 pounds of ice on
its<00:03:28.989> own<00:03:29.140> in<00:03:29.350> 24<00:03:29.739> hours<00:03:30.070> but<00:03:30.310> you're<00:03:30.790> not<00:03:30.910> using

its own in 24 hours but you're not using

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:32.550 
its own in 24 hours but you're not using
that<00:03:31.360> much<00:03:31.510> ice<00:03:31.750> so<00:03:31.900> you<00:03:31.930> can<00:03:32.110> program<00:03:32.440> this

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:32.560 
that much ice so you can program this

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.250 
that much ice so you can program this
machine<00:03:32.860> to<00:03:32.980> only<00:03:33.160> produce<00:03:33.400> 100
