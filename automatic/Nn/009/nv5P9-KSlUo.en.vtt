00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
regular drawing paper for this penguin

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.509 
regular drawing paper for this penguin
is<00:00:13.049> going<00:00:13.290> to<00:00:13.349> be<00:00:13.469> a<00:00:13.500> little<00:00:14.009> bit<00:00:14.130> more<00:00:14.280> of<00:00:14.429> a

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
is going to be a little bit more of a

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.220 
is going to be a little bit more of a
realistic<00:00:14.880> penguin<00:00:15.509> so<00:00:15.870> I'm<00:00:15.929> gonna<00:00:16.020> start<00:00:16.170> off

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
realistic penguin so I'm gonna start off

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:17.750 
realistic penguin so I'm gonna start off
with<00:00:16.350> a<00:00:16.379> circle<00:00:16.770> for<00:00:16.890> the<00:00:16.949> Penguins<00:00:17.340> head<00:00:17.580> in

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
with a circle for the Penguins head in

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.340 
with a circle for the Penguins head in
comparison<00:00:18.240> to<00:00:18.330> the<00:00:18.420> rest<00:00:18.570> of<00:00:18.720> its<00:00:18.840> body<00:00:18.900> its

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
comparison to the rest of its body its

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:20.660 
comparison to the rest of its body its
head<00:00:19.529> it's<00:00:19.650> going<00:00:19.830> to<00:00:19.890> be<00:00:19.980> a<00:00:20.010> rather<00:00:20.189> small

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
head it's going to be a rather small

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.700 
head it's going to be a rather small
circle<00:00:21.180> so<00:00:21.869> we<00:00:21.900> put<00:00:22.140> a<00:00:22.170> circle<00:00:22.500> for<00:00:22.590> the<00:00:22.680> head

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
circle so we put a circle for the head

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.470 
circle so we put a circle for the head
and<00:00:23.039> then<00:00:23.220> I'm<00:00:23.279> going<00:00:23.400> to<00:00:23.430> put<00:00:23.580> a<00:00:23.609> large<00:00:24.000> kind

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
and then I'm going to put a large kind

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.320 
and then I'm going to put a large kind
of<00:00:24.630> squared<00:00:25.140> oval<00:00:25.800> shape<00:00:26.609> for<00:00:26.849> the<00:00:26.939> body<00:00:27.150> of

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
of squared oval shape for the body of

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:37.340 
of squared oval shape for the body of
the<00:00:27.420> penguin<00:00:34.850> just<00:00:35.850> like<00:00:36.000> so<00:00:36.239> then<00:00:36.480> you<00:00:37.230> have

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
the penguin just like so then you have

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:38.600 
the penguin just like so then you have
to<00:00:37.380> decide<00:00:37.680> which<00:00:37.890> way<00:00:38.070> you<00:00:38.100> want<00:00:38.340> your

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
to decide which way you want your

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:39.889 
to decide which way you want your
penguin<00:00:38.940> looking<00:00:39.300> I'm<00:00:39.420> going<00:00:39.570> to<00:00:39.629> have<00:00:39.719> mine

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
penguin looking I'm going to have mine

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.900 
penguin looking I'm going to have mine
looking<00:00:40.170> off<00:00:40.320> this<00:00:40.350> direction<00:00:41.040> so<00:00:41.640> I'm<00:00:41.730> just

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
looking off this direction so I'm just

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.910 
looking off this direction so I'm just
going<00:00:42.059> to<00:00:42.090> go<00:00:42.570> along<00:00:42.719> with<00:00:43.110> this<00:00:43.290> line<00:00:43.649> here

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
going to go along with this line here

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.110 
going to go along with this line here
and<00:00:44.070> I'm<00:00:44.160> just<00:00:44.190> going<00:00:44.460> to<00:00:44.550> kind<00:00:44.760> of<00:00:44.820> come<00:00:44.969> all

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
the way up to the top of the head for

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.729 
the way up to the top of the head for
the<00:00:47.579> penguin<00:00:47.940> just<00:00:48.719> connect<00:00:49.200> that<00:00:49.260> right<00:00:49.559> in

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
the penguin just connect that right in

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.340 
the penguin just connect that right in
there<00:00:49.950> and<00:00:50.539> have<00:00:51.539> it<00:00:51.660> come<00:00:51.780> all<00:00:52.050> the<00:00:52.260> way

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
there and have it come all the way

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:53.990 
there and have it come all the way
around<00:00:52.680> so<00:00:52.800> it's<00:00:52.949> just<00:00:53.039> this<00:00:53.219> really<00:00:53.280> just

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
around so it's just this really just

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.840 
around so it's just this really just
seamless<00:00:54.660> line<00:00:54.870> all<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:55.320> way<00:00:55.379> up<00:00:55.559> and<00:00:55.850> stop

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
seamless line all the way up and stop

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.599 
seamless line all the way up and stop
just<00:00:57.239> before<00:00:57.570> I<00:00:57.600> get<00:00:57.719> to<00:00:57.930> the<00:00:58.020> halfway<00:00:58.230> mark

00:00:58.599 --> 00:00:58.609 
just before I get to the halfway mark

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:00.950 
just before I get to the halfway mark
and<00:00:59.609> here<00:00:59.820> I'm<00:00:59.879> going<00:01:00.000> to<00:01:00.059> put<00:01:00.270> in<00:01:00.359> my<00:01:00.390> line<00:01:00.750> for

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
and here I'm going to put in my line for

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.969 
and here I'm going to put in my line for
the<00:01:01.109> beak<00:01:02.210> bring<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.390> beak<00:01:03.570> line<00:01:03.809> out<00:01:04.019> and<00:01:04.320> I'm

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
the beak bring the beak line out and I'm

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.719 
the beak bring the beak line out and I'm
going<00:01:05.070> to<00:01:05.189> taper<00:01:05.580> this<00:01:05.939> line<00:01:06.590> out<00:01:07.590> and<00:01:08.040> down

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
going to taper this line out and down

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.020 
going to taper this line out and down
towards<00:01:09.450> the<00:01:09.659> point<00:01:09.900> of<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.140> beak<00:01:10.380> the<00:01:11.030> beak

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
towards the point of the beak the beak

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.080 
towards the point of the beak the beak
is<00:01:12.150> are<00:01:12.270> going<00:01:12.360> to<00:01:12.450> be<00:01:12.570> about<00:01:13.760> roughly<00:01:14.760> this

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
is are going to be about roughly this

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.480 
is are going to be about roughly this
little<00:01:15.990> it's<00:01:16.140> smaller<00:01:16.500> than<00:01:16.650> the<00:01:17.009> size<00:01:17.250> of<00:01:17.400> the

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
little it's smaller than the size of the

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.429 
little it's smaller than the size of the
head<00:01:17.640> circle<00:01:18.030> just<00:01:18.570> a<00:01:18.630> little<00:01:18.869> bit<00:01:18.960> but<00:01:19.140> almost

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
head circle just a little bit but almost

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:20.990 
head circle just a little bit but almost
about<00:01:19.710> the<00:01:19.830> same<00:01:20.009> size<00:01:20.280> that<00:01:20.310> you<00:01:20.670> would<00:01:20.790> put

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
about the same size that you would put

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.719 
about the same size that you would put
in<00:01:21.090> for<00:01:21.240> this<00:01:21.360> head<00:01:21.509> circle<00:01:22.369> have<00:01:23.369> that<00:01:23.549> come

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
in for this head circle have that come

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.520 
in for this head circle have that come
out<00:01:23.909> and<00:01:24.210> then<00:01:24.960> I'm<00:01:25.049> going<00:01:25.170> to<00:01:25.259> have<00:01:25.380> the

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
out and then I'm going to have the

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.170 
out and then I'm going to have the
bottom<00:01:25.860> part<00:01:25.890> of<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.189> beat<00:01:26.340> come<00:01:26.580> down<00:01:26.820> but<00:01:27.090> as

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
bottom part of the beat come down but as

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.140 
bottom part of the beat come down but as
it<00:01:27.270> gets<00:01:27.390> closer<00:01:27.720> it's<00:01:28.110> going<00:01:28.320> to<00:01:28.409> taper<00:01:28.650> down

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:29.150 
it gets closer it's going to taper down

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:33.740 
it gets closer it's going to taper down
towards<00:01:30.150> the<00:01:30.299> bottom<00:01:30.420> of<00:01:30.720> that<00:01:30.869> circle<00:01:32.750> now

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
towards the bottom of that circle now

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.300 
towards the bottom of that circle now
it's<00:01:33.930> going<00:01:34.079> to<00:01:34.170> when<00:01:34.500> it<00:01:34.590> gets<00:01:34.770> down<00:01:34.979> to<00:01:35.040> that

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
it's going to when it gets down to that

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.039 
it's going to when it gets down to that
bottom<00:01:35.490> circle<00:01:35.759> and<00:01:36.060> it<00:01:36.119> connects<00:01:36.450> with<00:01:36.659> this

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
bottom circle and it connects with this

down<00:03:19.260> the<00:03:19.440> middle<00:03:19.739> of<00:03:20.010> this<00:03:20.220> and<00:03:20.400> this<00:03:20.459> is

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:20.630 
down the middle of this and this is

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:23.330 
down the middle of this and this is
going<00:03:21.630> to<00:03:21.720> block<00:03:22.049> off<00:03:22.260> the<00:03:22.799> kind<00:03:22.980> of<00:03:23.010> the<00:03:23.130> black

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
going to block off the kind of the black

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:24.979 
going to block off the kind of the black
part<00:03:23.579> of<00:03:23.640> us<00:03:23.760> for<00:03:23.940> their<00:03:24.030> work<00:03:24.180> and<00:03:24.359> the<00:03:24.810> white

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:24.989 
part of us for their work and the white

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:26.810 
part of us for their work and the white
part<00:03:25.230> of<00:03:25.290> his<00:03:25.410> feathers<00:03:25.709> is<00:03:25.920> going<00:03:26.549> to<00:03:26.609> come

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:26.820 
part of his feathers is going to come

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:29.030 
part of his feathers is going to come
down<00:03:27.079> till<00:03:28.079> it<00:03:28.170> reaches<00:03:28.470> where<00:03:28.620> I<00:03:28.650> want<00:03:28.859> his

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
down till it reaches where I want his

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.460 
down till it reaches where I want his
wing<00:03:29.340> to<00:03:29.609> start<00:03:30.120> where<00:03:30.390> his<00:03:30.540> wing<00:03:30.810> comes<00:03:31.200> if

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
wing to start where his wing comes if

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.680 
wing to start where his wing comes if
you<00:03:31.560> cut<00:03:31.769> that<00:03:31.799> in<00:03:31.980> half<00:03:32.069> and<00:03:32.700> cut<00:03:33.359> that<00:03:33.510> in

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
you cut that in half and cut that in

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:35.930 
you cut that in half and cut that in
half<00:03:33.720> so<00:03:33.989> you<00:03:34.049> cut<00:03:34.230> this<00:03:34.319> in<00:03:34.500> fourths<00:03:35.040> about

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
half so you cut this in fourths about

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.750 
half so you cut this in fourths about
about<00:03:36.480> 1/4<00:03:37.079> way<00:03:37.410> down<00:03:37.739> you're<00:03:38.340> going<00:03:38.489> to<00:03:38.549> cut

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
about 1/4 way down you're going to cut

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.640 
about 1/4 way down you're going to cut
in<00:03:38.910> the<00:03:39.000> wing<00:03:39.209> which<00:03:39.630> is<00:03:39.780> going<00:03:39.989> to<00:03:40.049> be<00:03:40.170> have<00:03:40.620> a

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
in the wing which is going to be have a

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:43.250 
in the wing which is going to be have a
little<00:03:40.980> bit<00:03:41.100> of<00:03:41.220> a<00:03:41.480> not<00:03:42.480> a<00:03:42.510> straight<00:03:42.900> line<00:03:43.079> too

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
little bit of a not a straight line too

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:44.539 
little bit of a not a straight line too
it's<00:03:43.410> going<00:03:43.530> to<00:03:43.590> swoop<00:03:43.859> back<00:03:44.069> just<00:03:44.400> a<00:03:44.519> little

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:44.549 
it's going to swoop back just a little

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:47.660 
it's going to swoop back just a little
bit<00:03:44.760> and<00:03:45.000> then<00:03:45.269> forward<00:03:45.870> again<00:03:46.489> kind<00:03:47.489> of<00:03:47.519> want

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:47.670 
bit and then forward again kind of want

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:49.420 
bit and then forward again kind of want
to<00:03:47.700> just<00:03:47.760> think<00:03:48.030> of<00:03:48.120> a<00:03:48.209> bird<00:03:48.420> wing<00:03:48.660> shape<00:03:49.079> I

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:49.430 
to just think of a bird wing shape I

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:52.250 
to just think of a bird wing shape I
don't<00:03:50.430> have<00:03:50.609> the<00:03:51.359> feathers<00:03:51.780> that<00:03:52.019> you<00:03:52.109> would

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
don't have the feathers that you would

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.020 
don't have the feathers that you would
think<00:03:52.410> of<00:03:52.590> as<00:03:52.769> a<00:03:52.829> bird<00:03:53.459> because<00:03:53.819> they

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
think of as a bird because they

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:57.650 
think of as a bird because they
obviously<00:03:54.810> they<00:03:54.989> don't<00:03:55.079> fly<00:03:55.470> they<00:03:56.310> swim<00:03:56.760> so

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:57.660 
obviously they don't fly they swim so

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:59.569 
obviously they don't fly they swim so
their<00:03:57.840> feathers<00:03:58.109> would<00:03:58.260> be<00:03:58.410> very<00:03:58.799> very<00:03:59.100> small

00:03:59.569 --> 00:03:59.579 
their feathers would be very very small

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:04.789 
their feathers would be very very small
and<00:03:59.850> very<00:03:59.880> packed<00:04:00.389> together<00:04:03.350> so<00:04:04.350> you<00:04:04.440> really

00:04:04.789 --> 00:04:04.799 
and very packed together so you really

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:07.099 
and very packed together so you really
just<00:04:04.829> get<00:04:05.190> to<00:04:05.340> see<00:04:05.519> that<00:04:05.700> actual<00:04:06.209> shape<00:04:06.510> of<00:04:06.690> the

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:07.109 
just get to see that actual shape of the

00:04:07.109 --> 00:04:09.650 
just get to see that actual shape of the
wing<00:04:07.260> itself<00:04:07.829> and<00:04:08.130> then<00:04:08.940> you<00:04:08.970> can<00:04:09.150> bring<00:04:09.359> in

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:09.660 
wing itself and then you can bring in

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:12.349 
wing itself and then you can bring in
the<00:04:10.170> kind<00:04:10.410> of<00:04:10.470> pattern<00:04:10.709> of<00:04:11.010> the<00:04:11.459> feathering

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:12.359 
the kind of pattern of the feathering

00:04:12.359 --> 00:04:17.810 
the kind of pattern of the feathering
back<00:04:12.660> behind<00:04:12.840> there<00:04:16.280> so<00:04:17.280> if<00:04:17.370> you're<00:04:17.519> having<00:04:17.760> a

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:17.820 
back behind there so if you're having a

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:19.640 
back behind there so if you're having a
hard<00:04:18.000> time<00:04:18.030> kind<00:04:18.450> of<00:04:18.570> with<00:04:18.660> this<00:04:18.810> bird<00:04:19.079> shape<00:04:19.410> I

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:19.650 
hard time kind of with this bird shape I

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:21.649 
hard time kind of with this bird shape I
do<00:04:19.919> have<00:04:20.220> a<00:04:20.250> video<00:04:20.549> on<00:04:20.669> drawing<00:04:21.090> a<00:04:21.180> bird<00:04:21.450> wing

00:04:21.649 --> 00:04:21.659 
do have a video on drawing a bird wing

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:23.149 
do have a video on drawing a bird wing
kind<00:04:21.959> of<00:04:22.109> look<00:04:22.260> at<00:04:22.380> that<00:04:22.530> they'll<00:04:22.890> kind<00:04:23.130> of

00:04:23.149 --> 00:04:23.159 
kind of look at that they'll kind of

00:04:23.159 --> 00:04:25.279 
kind of look at that they'll kind of
show<00:04:23.370> you<00:04:23.430> how<00:04:23.669> that's<00:04:23.940> kind<00:04:24.510> of<00:04:24.570> similar<00:04:24.780> or

00:04:25.279 --> 00:04:25.289 
show you how that's kind of similar or

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:25.870 
show you how that's kind of similar or
also<00:04:25.560> you<00:04:25.620> can

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:25.880 
also you can

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:27.490 
also you can
look<00:04:25.970> at<00:04:26.090> your<00:04:26.240> reference<00:04:26.540> photos<00:04:26.870> so<00:04:27.320> let's

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:27.500 
look at your reference photos so let's

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:29.110 
look at your reference photos so let's
look<00:04:27.590> at<00:04:27.710> some<00:04:27.830> of<00:04:27.920> the<00:04:27.980> detail<00:04:28.370> on<00:04:28.670> the

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:29.120 
look at some of the detail on the

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:30.880 
look at some of the detail on the
Penguins<00:04:29.540> face<00:04:29.840> and<00:04:30.140> again<00:04:30.230> these<00:04:30.560> change

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:30.890 
Penguins face and again these change

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:32.860 
Penguins face and again these change
with<00:04:31.310> different<00:04:31.640> types<00:04:31.940> of<00:04:32.090> penguin<00:04:32.450> I'm

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:32.870 
with different types of penguin I'm

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:35.050 
with different types of penguin I'm
going<00:04:33.020> to<00:04:33.080> make<00:04:33.200> kind<00:04:33.320> of<00:04:33.440> more<00:04:33.710> of<00:04:33.830> a<00:04:33.950> I<00:04:34.250> guess

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:35.060 
going to make kind of more of a I guess

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:37.930 
going to make kind of more of a I guess
maybe<00:04:35.270> this<00:04:35.480> is<00:04:35.630> an<00:04:35.720> emperor<00:04:36.080> penguin<00:04:36.940> but

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:37.940 
maybe this is an emperor penguin but

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:41.260 
maybe this is an emperor penguin but
they<00:04:38.060> have<00:04:38.180> that<00:04:38.300> really<00:04:38.720> pretty<00:04:39.760> orange<00:04:40.760> kind

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:41.270 
they have that really pretty orange kind

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:44.290 
they have that really pretty orange kind
of<00:04:41.420> orange<00:04:42.200> a<00:04:42.290> yellow<00:04:42.760> splash<00:04:43.760> on<00:04:44.000> their<00:04:44.120> neck

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:44.300 
of orange a yellow splash on their neck

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:47.470 
of orange a yellow splash on their neck
so<00:04:44.330> I'm<00:04:44.510> going<00:04:44.630> to<00:04:44.660> kind<00:04:44.840> of<00:04:44.900> come<00:04:45.080> up<00:04:46.240> and<00:04:47.240> just

so I'm going to kind of come up and just
draw<00:04:47.630> this<00:04:47.810> little<00:04:48.080> kind<00:04:48.410> of<00:04:48.500> a<00:04:48.590> loop<00:04:48.890> right

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:49.160 
draw this little kind of a loop right

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:50.200 
draw this little kind of a loop right
there<00:04:49.190> and<00:04:49.460> I'm<00:04:49.550> going<00:04:49.670> to<00:04:49.700> fill<00:04:49.880> that<00:04:50.030> in<00:04:50.090> with

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:50.210 
there and I'm going to fill that in with

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:52.390 
there and I'm going to fill that in with
some<00:04:50.480> color<00:04:50.720> and<00:04:50.960> then<00:04:51.680> on<00:04:51.800> their<00:04:51.950> beak<00:04:52.190> they

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:57.590 
part there to their beak just got to

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:00.010 
part there to their beak just got to
color<00:04:57.770> that<00:04:57.860> in<00:04:58.270> now<00:04:59.270> it's<00:04:59.450> really<00:04:59.660> dark<00:04:59.900> you
