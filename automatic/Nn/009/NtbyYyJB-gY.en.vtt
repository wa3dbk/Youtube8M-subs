00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:01.560
 "broadcasting" 

00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:04.860
 "Congmei Discovery ~" 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:06.200
 Dear friends 

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:07.440
 and also 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:08.990
 Miss Sato Satoshi 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.920
 Good night everyone~ 

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:13.480
 Yeah~ 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.030
 Congratulations on the program broadcast to reach a hundred episodes 

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:17.570
 I am Xiaoye Yuchang. 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:19.640
 This .... sugar? 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:21.400
 Always 

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:22.650
 At the end of the show 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:25.360
 Leave a message to GTR 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:26.620
 Thank you very much. 

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:28.560
 Actually, sugar? 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:30.480
 Obviously don't want to talk to GTR 

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:31.200
 Not right 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:33.500
 I don’t want to talk to Ono Sakae. 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:34.920
 But it was also forced by the planners to talk about some... 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.440
 It’s like “Today’s Ono’s Intelligence”. 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.130
 I am really sorry~ granulated sugar 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:46.560
 That....the sugar always says when I mention it. 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:51.700
 "Really a great predecessor, I really want to talk to Mr. Ono," 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:56.030
 Although this is always said on the mouth 

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:57.070
 But in fact 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.150
 When the firm met 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:03.310
 Is it true that you don’t want to come over? 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.520
 Nothing 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.210
 Every time I follow the topic in the radio show 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.910
 I want to say "Hey ~ Sugar candy 妳 this guy ~" 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:19.200
 The result is that the dodging eyes are like saying "I don't really come over." 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:21.650
 About this....granulated sugar 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:23.760
 I am really worried 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:26.250
 Even once in a while 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.530
 After all, it’s a predecessor, even if you don’t want it, how much you have to deal with. 

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:36.090
 And what about the continuation of the show? 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:42.700
 It is to accept the words of the director, the producer and the writer. 

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:43.770
 In the future 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:47.120
 I want GTR....I am? 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:52.760
 Still continue to receive those spicy messages 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.530
 I won't take it to my heart. 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:59.160
 I also know that sugar does not want to relate to me. 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:03.060
 Then please work harder at work. 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:04.140
 Goodbye 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:08.890
 About the day before yesterday 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:10.890
 I met sugar in the office. 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.890
 The moment the sugar saw me.... 

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:20.880
 I just thought, "That's true~ If you want to hide, don't say it." 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:23.950
 I said "sand ~ sugar!" 

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:28.180
 She is "ah~ sorry...sorry..." 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:32.420
 What is she doing? 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:34.840
 Have you said anything? 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.390
 Well, I also said to the agent. 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.670
 "Sand sugar, she always said bad things about me on the radio show." 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:45.840
 "No, I didn't say it~" 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.500
 Also said "grand sugar, although I received glutinous chocolate" 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.520
 "But that was bought at "TOKYU HANDS", right? " 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.630
 "No~~ That's really what I did~" 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:04.800
 "Although the outer packaging is bought in "TOKYU HANDS"..." 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:09.180
 that guy....
