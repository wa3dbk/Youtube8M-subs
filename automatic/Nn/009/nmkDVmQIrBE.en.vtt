00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:04.170 
okay today what we're going to do is

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:06.110 
okay today what we're going to do is
we're<00:00:04.290> going<00:00:04.380> to<00:00:04.470> look<00:00:04.620> at<00:00:04.830> a<00:00:05.160> time<00:00:05.819> sheet

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:06.120 
we're going to look at a time sheet

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.270 
we're going to look at a time sheet
application<00:00:06.960> called<00:00:07.400> time<00:00:08.400> org<00:00:08.809> timesheet

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:10.280 
application called time org timesheet

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:13.400 
application called time org timesheet
it's<00:00:11.280> a<00:00:11.719> application<00:00:12.719> that<00:00:12.960> allows<00:00:13.049> you<00:00:13.380> to

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
it's a application that allows you to

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.099 
it's a application that allows you to
keep<00:00:13.530> track<00:00:13.590> of<00:00:13.860> your<00:00:14.009> time<00:00:14.370> in<00:00:15.360> my<00:00:15.540> case<00:00:15.599> I

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
keep track of your time in my case I

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.099 
keep track of your time in my case I
develop<00:00:16.650> websites<00:00:16.859> and<00:00:17.460> I<00:00:17.550> also<00:00:17.820> do<00:00:18.690> computer

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
develop websites and I also do computer

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.380 
develop websites and I also do computer
repairs<00:00:19.439> from<00:00:19.560> service<00:00:19.980> so<00:00:20.430> a<00:00:20.460> timesheet<00:00:21.180> is<00:00:21.240> a

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
repairs from service so a timesheet is a

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.620 
repairs from service so a timesheet is a
necessity<00:00:22.400> this<00:00:23.400> allows<00:00:23.760> me<00:00:23.789> to<00:00:24.029> keep<00:00:24.300> track

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
necessity this allows me to keep track

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.050 
necessity this allows me to keep track
of<00:00:24.660> it<00:00:25.019> which<00:00:25.710> is<00:00:25.890> basically<00:00:26.340> the<00:00:26.580> flick<00:00:26.849> of<00:00:26.880> my

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
of it which is basically the flick of my

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.529 
of it which is basically the flick of my
finger<00:00:27.210> to<00:00:28.199> turn<00:00:28.380> on<00:00:28.619> or<00:00:28.830> off<00:00:28.859> the<00:00:29.039> timer<00:00:29.670> so

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
finger to turn on or off the timer so

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.360 
finger to turn on or off the timer so
let's<00:00:31.439> go<00:00:31.590> on<00:00:31.769> into<00:00:32.009> the<00:00:32.610> timesheet<00:00:33.149> app<00:00:33.540> and

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:34.370 
let's go on into the timesheet app and

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:38.660 
let's go on into the timesheet app and
this<00:00:35.370> is<00:00:35.520> a<00:00:35.550> free<00:00:36.090> app<00:00:36.980> I'm<00:00:37.980> going<00:00:38.250> to<00:00:38.340> get<00:00:38.460> out

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
this is a free app I'm going to get out

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.470 
this is a free app I'm going to get out
of<00:00:38.700> that<00:00:38.910> section<00:00:39.600> there

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:41.480 
of that section there

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:43.820 
you know they're okay let's go to main

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:46.479 
you know they're okay let's go to main
screen<00:00:44.239> here<00:00:44.510> okay<00:00:45.410> so<00:00:45.829> if<00:00:46.130> you'll<00:00:46.280> notice

from there it keeps running in the
background<00:01:05.420> there's<00:01:06.320> a<00:01:06.440> badge<00:01:06.800> here<00:01:07.490> that

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:07.790 
background there's a badge here that

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:10.240 
background there's a badge here that
shows<00:01:08.060> that<00:01:08.119> it<00:01:08.540> is<00:01:08.660> still<00:01:08.869> running<00:01:09.290> so<00:01:10.130> I<00:01:10.160> know

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:25.880 
back to my timesheet I tap on it go back

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:27.550 
back to my timesheet I tap on it go back
into<00:01:26.149> it<00:01:26.420> notice<00:01:26.840> the<00:01:26.960> clock<00:01:27.200> still<00:01:27.500> ticking

the downside to that slider is it will
only<00:03:50.830> go<00:03:51.069> up<00:03:51.099> to<00:03:51.280> 12<00:03:51.580> hour<00:03:51.760> day<00:03:52.000> so<00:03:52.060> if<00:03:52.390> you<00:03:52.510> work

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:52.950 
only go up to 12 hour day so if you work

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:56.160 
only go up to 12 hour day so if you work
16-hour<00:03:53.950> days<00:03:54.220> it's<00:03:54.640> that<00:03:54.970> one<00:03:55.599> feature<00:03:55.840> won't

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:56.170 
16-hour days it's that one feature won't

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:58.500 
16-hour days it's that one feature won't
do<00:03:56.349> you<00:03:56.440> a<00:03:56.470> lot<00:03:56.769> of<00:03:56.830> good<00:03:56.950> but<00:03:57.430> still<00:03:58.239> that's

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:58.510 
do you a lot of good but still that's

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:00.660 
do you a lot of good but still that's
that's<00:03:59.049> one<00:03:59.230> of<00:03:59.290> the<00:03:59.379> characteristics<00:04:00.159> of<00:04:00.549> the

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:00.670 
that's one of the characteristics of the

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:03.479 
that's one of the characteristics of the
software<00:04:01.060> now<00:04:01.780> another<00:04:02.019> thing<00:04:02.140> here<00:04:02.590> is<00:04:02.709> i<00:04:03.280> can
