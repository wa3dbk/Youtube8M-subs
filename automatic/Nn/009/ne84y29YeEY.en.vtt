00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:06.270
 and then my people are with another video 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.429
 This time I'm bringing it here play the 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.650
 black ops two for you on ray map 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.750
 jacket and in this video I'll give some 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.470
 tips for you to die little on this map 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:18.840
 which is a very busy milestone that 

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:22.109
 meet 6 against is well imagine 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:25.170
 nine against nine is but north decided 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:28.410
 bring one in pdm for you with 25/3 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.660
 fred I think it's cool it's a ferry 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.120
 reasonable for the pdm if it were maybe 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.010
 one with a domain name I could 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.440
 15 more probably fred a little 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.930
 better but I think it was really cool 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.390
 Even I 'm bringing you here and 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.460
 the tips I want to give you are 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.460
 basically the following for this I 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:50.520
 I put the carlton and vidic strike to 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:53.550
 and the shopper is this 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.989
 combination and was very efficient because tt 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.850
 help enough to get the guys 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.500
 unprepared and still catch good kills 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.199
 right especially with the mall that 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.210
 on this map it does a lot of damage 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:05.580
 is this map your small map you 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:09.299
 able to position it more easily 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:11.490
 and is the following is basically the calculation 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:14.580
 He will not let you down is visibly. 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.560
 map them and it helps you a lot 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:20.520
 because you can catch the unwary 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:22.350
 and the main tip here is to avoid the center 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.270
 of the map I know you should already have 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.460
 I heard that a lot on youtube 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.369
 but this is the most important map that 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:32.189
 you must take this into account 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:34.049
 Everyone wants to know that 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:36.570
 enemy is in the middle of the map because 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:38.640
 You can see everyone who is born already 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.560
 go running there and like these guys 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.960
 they did not even realize that he was on the 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:46.290
 them and there and this will be the art to 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:48.240
 You died little and 14 and I saw man and this 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:51.750
 helps a lot by leaving enemies 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:54.630
 blind and always exceptional 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.460
 basically you should not go by the side 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.640
 of the maps there on the map side alias 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:01.110
 Because there are many tickets , and the 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.570
 I recommend you is pass the 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:06.240
 kind of like I'm going through now 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:08.580
 be very careful in this fights over there 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.660
 they emphasize the gametes of the confused 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:13.270
 put more beauty 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:15.520
 and you looking fine, can you 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:18.070
 that the ones but be careful for I have not seen more 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:20.320
 2m ghosn together like this because it goes 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:20.980
 disrupt and quite likely you 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:22.810
 gonna die 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:24.760
 so pay close attention to the mini 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:27.370
 map and is well located 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:30.460
 I 've never lied in the middle of a fight with 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:32.590
 with two guys so the team is well 

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:37.270
 stel felipe local and I saw that you will have 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:39.910
 pick up and rocket beauty and in that exchange 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:42.190
 since they get up to 6 in the expensive guy and I 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:44.110
 I do not know how to play dinap sincerely if 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:47.980
 has taken 5 than conventional ones by 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:49.810
 block 2 will be much but at last it is with 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:52.210
 Shopper there guy you will get good 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:55.450
 kills and how you can see the guys neither 

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:57.370
 imagine that I am here and will be the 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:59.920
 ideal for you to get tempting 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:01.900
 catch them on the side, yes, not from the front 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.460
 always as in the case here if I had 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:05.860
 appeared in front of him probably 

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:09.550
 would have happened a range fight and I 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:11.290
 because she could have died and guys 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:13.810
 this video that is coming out most evenings 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:15.640
 but in the afternoon so I want to know 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:19.390
 How will the feedback be if you guys are? 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:21.670
 think posting is the night so the 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:23.650
 but at lunchtime the same as it is 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:25.450

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:35.170
 have tanned that gameplay died only 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:37.240
 three times on this map here is very difficult 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:38.800
 even if you walk away 

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:41.980
 I know there without paying attention to anything you 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:43.810
 is going to die a lot and I hope they 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:45.880
 value it there that you have 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:48.430
 liked the audio now in the microphone or 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:51.790
 using an expo of mine that helps me 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:53.830
 avoid that blow nÃ© that the px 2011 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:56.530
 captures a lot I hope you have 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:04:00.520
 also liked the audio quality of 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:02.530
