00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:17.530
 our role is totally 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.150
 save lives the savoy 

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:22.580
 if we must intervene, it is above all 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:23.450
 to save the lives of people who 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:27.140
 are on board planes 

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:28.939
 to leave it to extinguish the fire or to avoid us 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:30.890
 the damage on the planes 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:33.470
 it's secondary our first goal 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:38.320
 it's about saving lives these days 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:38.320
 very definition of our work to see 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:43.160
 bones that if you mean by risk so the 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:46.070
 main risk on an airplane c the 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:49.400
 hydrocarbons whose fuel therefore 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:51.290
 our priority is to establish or heavy 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:55.400
 evacuation for passengers it saves 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:57.260
 vocal stage must absolutely protect the 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.790
 cell at the party believes privileged 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.409
 to be able to evacuate their style for this 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:02.049
 second rescue 

00:00:59.409 --> 00:01:04.430
 so here we will make a foam mat 

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:08.630
 who's going to serve as cutlery that's for sure 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:10.850
 airport hydrocarbons for our 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:14.360
 airport we are four in service 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:17.000
 we work two a day of service in 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.560
 permanence and our sector it's 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.429
 only the airport we do not intervene 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:23.409
 that jobs 

00:01:20.429 --> 00:01:25.210
 so how are you alerting and who 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:27.909
 give the alertent like for example the 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:29.020
 say and do you have as soon as 

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:32.729
 you have knowledge of 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.729
 incidents that will happen during a flight 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:50.079
 precisely there we go on alert and the 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.060
 knowledge of the terrain after it is sure 

00:01:50.079 --> 00:01:56.530
 of what will happen if they get to 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:59.579
 ask otherwise we will participate in the 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:59.579
 Research period 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.729
 that is, if there is a glitch 

00:02:04.329 --> 00:02:08.769
 serious accidents the control tower 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:09.849
 does his job locally but from 

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:11.440
 anyway there is a backup plan 

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:12.340
 that triggered the prefect CEI which 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.560
 becomes responsible 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:18.310
 as for any big accident 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:22.629
 large-scale of his back from his 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:26.670
 region his sector they are 

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:26.670
 mainly to the type of intervention 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:34.280
 the most common is actually a bit of 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:36.260
 rescue is the protection of 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.820
 passengers in case of refueling 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.640
 tokyo as the rowing club with 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:43.280
 words covered the passengers on board so 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:46.520
 it's really prevention the function 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:48.320
 otherwise it is an alarm of a seer 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:50.300
 on rowing so we have them less 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:51.800
 three unlocked trains serves more 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:53.540
 short 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:56.420
 can you handle alone your your 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:58.400
 interventions example cost planes otherwise 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:01.820
 are you taking young back with 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:03.680
 other gases stopped a little bit what 

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:05.390
 I mentioned earlier that 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:07.070
 at first it's us who 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:09.170
 let's go we are the first 

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:10.940
 speakers and to but after that's the 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:12.950
 prefect who triggers the whole system of 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:14.080
 their rescue plan is there 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:16.460
 actually all firefighters 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:18.890
 available will be put on alert and at its 

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:21.830
 Meme it request there is a drone where we ourselves 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:23.030
 help in case of big interventions 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:25.220
 like crashes 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:27.380
 Has it something that warns 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:30.100
 surrounding populations and do we 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:30.100
 must evacuate them 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:38.120
 it's a bit of a question 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:39.590
 particular because everything depends where this 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:41.540
 cost takes place the crash 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:43.180
 if the crash actually is going to be at 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:45.380
 near a town or village 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:47.360
 if there are risks to the population 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:49.040
 at that moment so again the 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:51.530
 prefect and will make every effort to 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:55.380
 prevent people and that people 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:56.760
 people are either evacuated but good 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:59.100
 in general it is still going pretty 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:00.870
 near airports is so there it 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:02.250
 is not there is no calling it the 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:05.820
 populations are not concerned 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:07.740
 directly what are the means 

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:08.340
 that you have available for 

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:10.500
 intervene 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:14.190
 are there any specific ways for his 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:16.980
 aeronautical interventions so not everything 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:19.830
 actually on specialized vehicles that 

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:21.770
 are intended to work in priority 

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:24.150
 with foam for hydrocarbons 

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:26.820
 and which are specific for the 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:29.400
 airports that are manufactured 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:32.930
 especially for airports with 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:32.930
 particular equipment that we use
