00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
here again from guitar jams dot-com I've

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.810 
here again from guitar jams dot-com I've
got<00:00:57.120> a<00:00:57.150> little<00:00:57.510> outside<00:00:58.350> the<00:00:58.710> box<00:00:58.950> kind<00:00:59.700> of

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
got a little outside the box kind of

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.450 
got a little outside the box kind of
lick<00:01:00.000> for<00:01:00.239> you<00:01:00.420> reminds<00:01:01.350> me<00:01:01.470> of<00:01:01.680> some<00:01:02.309> of<00:01:02.400> the

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
lick for you reminds me of some of the

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:03.590 
lick for you reminds me of some of the
Allman<00:01:02.730> Brothers<00:01:03.030> stuff<00:01:03.300> when<00:01:03.510> they're

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
Allman Brothers stuff when they're

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.719 
Allman Brothers stuff when they're
jamming<00:01:04.110> really<00:01:04.350> hard<00:01:04.589> and<00:01:05.070> it's<00:01:05.339> this<00:01:05.460> little

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
jamming really hard and it's this little

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.249 
jamming really hard and it's this little
device<00:01:05.820> I<00:01:06.150> have<00:01:06.330> that<00:01:06.570> makes<00:01:06.840> you<00:01:06.960> you<00:01:07.170> know

00:01:07.249 --> 00:01:07.259 
device I have that makes you you know

00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:09.380 
device I have that makes you you know
it's<00:01:07.380> like<00:01:07.500> a<00:01:07.530> more<00:01:07.740> exotic<00:01:08.640> sound<00:01:09.119> that<00:01:09.330> you

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
it's like a more exotic sound that you

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:10.940 
it's like a more exotic sound that you
can<00:01:09.540> add<00:01:09.660> in<00:01:09.810> there<00:01:10.020> I<00:01:10.170> guess<00:01:10.500> you<00:01:10.650> could<00:01:10.830> call

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
can add in there I guess you could call

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.740 
can add in there I guess you could call
it<00:01:11.009> kind<00:01:11.220> of<00:01:11.280> a<00:01:11.400> jazz<00:01:11.670> fusion<00:01:12.000> kind<00:01:12.479> of<00:01:12.540> thing

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
it kind of a jazz fusion kind of thing

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.660 
it kind of a jazz fusion kind of thing
but<00:01:13.200> really<00:01:13.470> it's<00:01:13.590> just<00:01:13.649> using<00:01:14.040> some<00:01:14.190> outside

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
but really it's just using some outside

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.330 
but really it's just using some outside
notes<00:01:14.940> outside<00:01:15.899> of<00:01:15.960> the<00:01:16.140> pentatonic<00:01:16.560> and<00:01:16.979> so<00:01:17.310> I

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
notes outside of the pentatonic and so I

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.790 
notes outside of the pentatonic and so I
think<00:01:17.490> of<00:01:17.759> it<00:01:17.910> and<00:01:18.149> you<00:01:19.110> know<00:01:19.229> you<00:01:19.410> can<00:01:19.530> add<00:01:19.710> it

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:19.800 
think of it and you know you can add it

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.650 
think of it and you know you can add it

Brothers<00:01:51.330> I<00:01:51.600> think<00:01:51.840> of<00:01:52.050> in<00:01:52.560> memory<00:01:52.950> of

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
Brothers I think of in memory of

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.510 
Brothers I think of in memory of
Elizabeth<00:01:53.369> Reed<00:01:53.970> and<00:01:54.750> some<00:01:55.560> of<00:01:55.649> their<00:01:55.800> moody

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
Elizabeth Reed and some of their moody

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:02.029 
Elizabeth Reed and some of their moody
line<00:01:58.220> jazz<00:01:59.220> blues<00:01:59.610> blues<00:02:00.209> jazz<00:02:01.039> explorations

00:02:02.029 --> 00:02:02.039 
line jazz blues blues jazz explorations

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:05.150 
line jazz blues blues jazz explorations
but<00:02:02.209> anyway<00:02:03.209> we<00:02:03.450> got<00:02:03.479> a<00:02:03.599> G<00:02:03.840> thing<00:02:04.080> G<00:02:04.920> minor

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:05.160 
but anyway we got a G thing G minor

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.520 
but anyway we got a G thing G minor
seven<00:02:05.640> and<00:02:06.240> so<00:02:06.630> you'd<00:02:06.750> have<00:02:06.780> that<00:02:07.050> G<00:02:07.289> minor

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
seven and so you'd have that G minor

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:17.990 
seven and so you'd have that G minor
pentatonic<00:02:07.950> scale<00:02:08.459> correct<00:02:16.580> but<00:02:17.580> here's<00:02:17.819> some

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
pentatonic scale correct but here's some

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.730 
pentatonic scale correct but here's some
cool<00:02:18.209> outside<00:02:18.510> notes<00:02:18.959> that<00:02:19.170> you<00:02:19.230> can<00:02:19.380> add<00:02:19.560> to

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
cool outside notes that you can add to

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:21.110 
cool outside notes that you can add to
jazz<00:02:20.040> things<00:02:20.069> up<00:02:20.610> a<00:02:20.730> bit

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
jazz things up a bit

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.760 
jazz things up a bit
or<00:02:21.330> just<00:02:21.750> add<00:02:22.230> tension<00:02:24.530> basically<00:02:25.530> you<00:02:25.590> go

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
or just add tension basically you go

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:29.059 
or just add tension basically you go
like<00:02:25.920> this<00:02:25.950> I<00:02:26.490> think<00:02:26.730> of<00:02:26.819> it<00:02:27.080> like<00:02:28.080> a<00:02:28.140> shift<00:02:28.650> so

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:29.069 
like this I think of it like a shift so

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:31.550 
like this I think of it like a shift so
if<00:02:29.130> my<00:02:29.280> index<00:02:29.700> finger<00:02:30.120> is<00:02:30.360> on<00:02:30.780> that<00:02:31.050> third<00:02:31.319> fret

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
if my index finger is on that third fret

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:39.830 
if my index finger is on that third fret
of<00:02:31.590> the<00:02:31.709> G<00:02:32.010> right<00:02:32.250> there<00:02:32.489> I<00:02:38.660> think<00:02:39.660> of<00:02:39.720> it<00:02:39.810> like

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
of the G right there I think of it like

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.900 
of the G right there I think of it like
this<00:02:40.110> I<00:02:40.290> just<00:02:40.319> slide<00:02:40.739> my<00:02:40.770> index<00:02:41.310> finger<00:02:41.580> down<00:02:41.880> a

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
this I just slide my index finger down a

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:44.770 
this I just slide my index finger down a
half<00:02:42.210> step

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:47.300 

and<00:02:45.780> now<00:02:45.990> I<00:02:46.020> have<00:02:46.350> either<00:02:46.650> of<00:02:46.800> those<00:02:46.920> notes

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
and now I have either of those notes

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.060 
and now I have either of those notes
with<00:02:47.760> my<00:02:47.910> index<00:02:48.270> there<00:02:48.660> and<00:02:48.960> my<00:02:49.320> middle<00:02:49.770> finger

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.070 
with my index there and my middle finger

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:57.710 
with my index there and my middle finger
there<00:02:54.710> and<00:02:55.710> then<00:02:55.950> I<00:02:55.980> shift<00:02:56.400> my<00:02:56.580> pinky<00:02:57.030> to<00:02:57.570> that

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
there and then I shift my pinky to that

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.290 
there and then I shift my pinky to that
route<00:02:58.080> instead<00:02:58.380> of<00:02:58.560> my<00:02:58.680> ring<00:02:58.890> finger<00:02:59.250> and<00:02:59.430> that

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:00.300 
route instead of my ring finger and that

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:01.760 
route instead of my ring finger and that
would<00:03:00.420> be<00:03:00.540> the<00:03:00.690> fifth<00:03:00.900> fret<00:03:01.140> of<00:03:01.290> the<00:03:01.320> D<00:03:01.530> which

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:01.770 
would be the fifth fret of the D which

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:05.330 
would be the fifth fret of the D which
is<00:03:01.890> a<00:03:01.920> G<00:03:02.250> note<00:03:03.590> so<00:03:04.590> you<00:03:04.650> know<00:03:04.920> I'm<00:03:05.010> jamming

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
is a G note so you know I'm jamming

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:11.750 
is a G note so you know I'm jamming
along<00:03:05.520> in<00:03:05.670> G<00:03:05.850> minor<00:03:06.710> pentatonic<00:03:10.550> shift<00:03:11.550> right

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
along in G minor pentatonic shift right

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:43.450 
along in G minor pentatonic shift right
there<00:03:14.120> pinky<00:03:15.120> on<00:03:15.240> that

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:43.460 

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:46.040 

okay<00:03:44.460> then<00:03:44.820> you<00:03:45.000> have<00:03:45.120> this<00:03:45.270> leading<00:03:45.750> tone

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:46.050 
okay then you have this leading tone

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:49.370 
okay then you have this leading tone
which<00:03:47.010> is<00:03:47.040> real<00:03:47.400> funky<00:03:48.110> but<00:03:49.110> it's<00:03:49.200> just<00:03:49.320> a

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:49.380 
which is real funky but it's just a

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:51.650 
which is real funky but it's just a
passing<00:03:49.830> tone<00:03:49.980> into<00:03:50.340> that<00:03:50.490> route<00:03:50.760> so<00:03:51.360> it's<00:03:51.510> the

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660 
passing tone into that route so it's the

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:59.240 
passing tone into that route so it's the
fourth<00:03:51.960> fret<00:03:52.200> of<00:03:52.470> the<00:03:52.500> D<00:03:57.830> you<00:03:58.830> really<00:03:59.100> just

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 
fourth fret of the D you really just

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:00.770 
fourth fret of the D you really just
want<00:03:59.430> to<00:03:59.490> hear<00:03:59.640> it<00:03:59.700> going<00:03:59.970> into<00:04:00.210> that<00:04:00.570> you

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
want to hear it going into that you

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:05.090 
want to hear it going into that you
don't<00:04:00.930> want<00:04:01.050> to<00:04:01.110> be<00:04:01.200> like<00:04:03.440> it's<00:04:04.440> always<00:04:04.680> gonna

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:05.100 
don't want to be like it's always gonna

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:18.070 
don't want to be like it's always gonna
be

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:18.080 

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:27.190

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:49.800 
fret of the B same note so now we're in

00:04:49.800 --> 00:05:12.420 
fret of the B same note so now we're in
this<00:04:49.890> little<00:04:49.950> position<00:04:50.460> with<00:04:50.760> our<00:04:50.790> hand

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:12.430 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:15.640 

once<00:05:13.430> you're<00:05:13.580> there<00:05:13.610> you<00:05:14.330> got<00:05:14.480> a<00:05:14.510> either<00:05:15.260> stay

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:15.650 
once you're there you got a either stay

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:17.620 
once you're there you got a either stay
in<00:05:15.680> that<00:05:15.920> little<00:05:16.220> position<00:05:16.490> there<00:05:16.850> and<00:05:17.060> then

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:17.630 
in that little position there and then

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:20.080 
in that little position there and then
either<00:05:18.320> slide<00:05:18.890> up<00:05:19.130> with<00:05:19.250> your<00:05:19.370> index<00:05:19.700> instead

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:20.090 
either slide up with your index instead

00:05:20.090 --> 00:06:02.920 
either slide up with your index instead
of<00:05:20.180> going

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:02.930 

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:05.030 

so<00:06:03.930> in<00:06:04.020> other<00:06:04.110> words<00:06:04.200> you've<00:06:04.500> got<00:06:04.680> your<00:06:04.860> normal

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:05.040 
so in other words you've got your normal

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:07.340 
so in other words you've got your normal
blue<00:06:05.400> stuff<00:06:05.730> and<00:06:06.090> if<00:06:06.480> the<00:06:06.600> moment<00:06:06.840> is<00:06:07.080> right

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:07.350 
blue stuff and if the moment is right

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:09.680 
blue stuff and if the moment is right
then<00:06:08.130> you<00:06:08.280> can<00:06:08.430> get<00:06:08.550> it<00:06:08.670> switch<00:06:09.210> into<00:06:09.510> this

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:09.690 
then you can get it switch into this

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:12.170 
then you can get it switch into this
little<00:06:10.050> device<00:06:10.200> here<00:06:10.680> and<00:06:10.920> add<00:06:11.190> some<00:06:11.760> outside

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:12.180 
little device here and add some outside

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:14.600 
little device here and add some outside
notes<00:06:12.450> another<00:06:13.380> thing<00:06:13.650> from<00:06:13.860> that<00:06:14.040> that<00:06:14.490> you

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:14.610 
notes another thing from that that you

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:17.090 
notes another thing from that that you
can<00:06:14.730> do<00:06:14.880> which<00:06:15.510> is<00:06:15.660> a<00:06:15.690> super<00:06:16.080> straight<00:06:16.920> from

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:17.100

jazz<00:06:17.340> you<00:06:17.970> know<00:06:18.030> jazz<00:06:18.420> a<00:06:18.840> jazz<00:06:19.650> line<00:06:20.010> you<00:06:20.280> could

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:20.400 
jazz you know jazz a jazz line you could

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:30.770 
jazz you know jazz a jazz line you could
say<00:06:20.640> is<00:06:21.260> you<00:06:22.260> got<00:06:22.380> that<00:06:22.530> note<00:06:29.240> that's<00:06:30.240> a<00:06:30.390> minor

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:30.780 
say is you got that note that's a minor

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:39.529 
say is you got that note that's a minor
arpeggio

00:06:39.529 --> 00:06:39.539 

00:06:39.539 --> 00:06:42.119 

okay<00:06:40.539> but<00:06:40.840> what<00:06:40.960> you<00:06:41.020> can<00:06:41.169> do<00:06:41.319> is<00:06:41.620> this<00:06:41.860> kind<00:06:42.069> of

00:06:42.119 --> 00:06:42.129 
okay but what you can do is this kind of

00:06:42.129 --> 00:07:37.960 
okay but what you can do is this kind of
vibe<00:06:42.340> for<00:06:42.639> each<00:06:42.759> note

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:37.970 

00:07:37.970 --> 00:07:40.550 

so<00:07:38.970> try<00:07:39.150> some<00:07:39.210> of<00:07:39.419> those<00:07:39.509> new<00:07:39.720> ideas<00:07:39.780> out<00:07:40.319> and

00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:40.560 
so try some of those new ideas out and

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:41.870 
so try some of those new ideas out and
just<00:07:40.770> even<00:07:40.949> if<00:07:41.099> you<00:07:41.160> can<00:07:41.280> add<00:07:41.400> one<00:07:41.699> little

00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:41.880 
just even if you can add one little

00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:44.870 
just even if you can add one little
extra<00:07:42.120> idea<00:07:43.099> then<00:07:44.099> that's<00:07:44.340> how<00:07:44.520> you<00:07:44.550> get<00:07:44.729> the

00:07:44.870 --> 00:07:44.880 
extra idea then that's how you get the

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:46.879 
extra idea then that's how you get the
ball<00:07:45.120> rolling<00:07:45.840> and<00:07:46.110> so<00:07:46.349> go<00:07:46.500> ahead<00:07:46.590> and<00:07:46.710> get
