00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
junkyard I've removed the piece out of

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.290 
junkyard I've removed the piece out of
the<00:00:54.960> middle<00:00:55.199> that<00:00:55.289> I<00:00:55.350> need<00:00:55.620> but<00:00:56.550> after<00:00:57.180> the

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
the middle that I need but after the

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.299 
the middle that I need but after the
piece<00:00:57.539> is<00:00:57.719> broken<00:00:58.050> like<00:00:58.620> this<00:00:58.859> is<00:00:59.039> what<00:00:59.190> it

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
piece is broken like this is what it

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.099 
piece is broken like this is what it
looks<00:00:59.460> like<00:00:59.609> underneath<00:00:59.969> my<00:01:00.210> hood<00:01:00.420> the<00:01:00.870> piece

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
looks like underneath my hood the piece

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.759 
looks like underneath my hood the piece
is<00:01:01.260> broken<00:01:01.609> so<00:01:02.609> this<00:01:03.449> doesn't<00:01:03.840> really<00:01:04.019> stay<00:01:04.739> on

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
is broken so this doesn't really stay on

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.730 
is broken so this doesn't really stay on
there<00:01:05.369> too<00:01:05.580> well<00:01:05.820> because<00:01:06.350> the<00:01:07.350> piece<00:01:07.560> is

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
there too well because the piece is

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.260 
there too well because the piece is
missing<00:01:07.860> so<00:01:08.369> what<00:01:08.549> we're<00:01:08.670> going<00:01:08.790> to<00:01:08.880> do<00:01:09.030> is

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
missing so what we're going to do is

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.469 
missing so what we're going to do is
we're<00:01:10.049> going<00:01:10.080> to<00:01:10.380> take<00:01:11.040> a<00:01:11.100> rubber<00:01:11.369> band<00:01:11.490> and

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
we're going to take a rubber band and

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:13.910 
we're going to take a rubber band and
we're<00:01:12.600> going<00:01:12.720> to<00:01:12.780> wrap<00:01:12.900> a<00:01:12.930> rubber<00:01:13.260> band<00:01:13.439> around

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
we're going to wrap a rubber band around

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.550 
we're going to wrap a rubber band around
there<00:01:14.340> temporarily<00:01:15.090> just<00:01:15.720> to<00:01:15.869> hold<00:01:16.110> that<00:01:16.320> on

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
there temporarily just to hold that on

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.179 
there temporarily just to hold that on
there<00:01:16.950> so<00:01:17.280> when<00:01:17.460> I<00:01:17.490> use<00:01:18.270> the<00:01:18.479> shifter<00:01:19.020> it<00:01:19.799> will

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
there so when I use the shifter it will

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.810 
there so when I use the shifter it will
work<00:01:20.430> until<00:01:21.299> we<00:01:21.450> can<00:01:21.570> fix<00:01:22.020> it<00:01:22.259> and<00:01:22.770> here<00:01:23.580> coming
