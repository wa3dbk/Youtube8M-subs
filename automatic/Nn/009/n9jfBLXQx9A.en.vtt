00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:04.259
 very good kids that as you are 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:07.049
 Of course, if you target a path that 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:08.580
 would go back to this this mythical map in the 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:10.440
 summit map of whites one because 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.110
 after yesterday's trailer of the third 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.879
 lp in guns said the last map 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:18.090
 apple inc is therefore going to be a 

00:00:14.879 --> 00:00:21.269
 remasterization of the summit no of 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:24.090
 whites or not a thing very similar to what 

00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:26.519
 what they did with study and feeling right 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.349
 Well, very happy that I'm going back this 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.720
 map now we will spend a little comment 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.969
 the lcd trailer especially of zombies 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.440
 that I have enough things to tell you 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.870
 some you will already know and others 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.239
 then you will find out now but good 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.129
 I was going back to this game of kids that 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.110
 there was a very bad connection by the way 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.420
 because this was playing 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.579
 early morning and you see that I touched with people 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.989
 that at dawn there is very little 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:52.199
 people from Spain playing and the truth that 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:54.899
 there was a connection very very very very bad 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.250
 and good a very bad connection and also 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.489
 I remember that in the harassment not many times 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:02.280
 they put you many falsehoods not the same 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.680
 that sponge avant did not happen to you 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.290
 falsehood but good with the house 74 this 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.450
 mythical weapon the cheto this that that goes very 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.400
 very very very well and good I took out the 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.320
 puppies the black see me I make a 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.740
 flirtatious streak and I realize that 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.960
 I'm going 25-28 one and the game was not 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.640
 reached 5,000 points and then already 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.930
 as a result of that I started to die then I 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.120
 take another streak but good is 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.910
 pretty good I'll leave a little bit of 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:29.130
 background to comment the trailer that the 

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:30.930
 yesterday they went up nothing simply the 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.080
 four multiplayer cameras code that 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:37.110
 well they tell us that it is an island that is 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:38.400
 in the ocean the Indian Ocean that says 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.050
 that there are many coverages and the truth 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.880
 that on this map and the next one 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:44.700
 I imagine some air gushes that 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:47.310
 destroy that house and a living thing or a 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.440
 swarm and let's destroy do it the 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.520
 massacre it will be fine to take off the 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:52.620
 air gusts 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.350
 but hey it's basically a map 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:56.880
 little thing that I like 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.310
 well we went to the next one that is 10 south 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.530
 that set in a bridge the truth 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.840
 that another map with which the gusts 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.060
 air will go very well 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.829
 The sad one says he has several 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.050
 heights we can be fighting 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:11.790
 in the top part that we can be 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.769
 fighting down that says it was a 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:16.019
 shotgun a submachine gun maybe the best 

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:17.519
 choice but good several things and the 

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:19.680
 true that some air gushes are guardo 

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:21.840
 As Willy said, well, the truth is that 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.670
 I wanted to destroy quite the 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:27.640
 next map the ras 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:29.680
 I set a map of paintball no 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:32.860
 There is much to say about this map and 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:34.690
 he says that he either says the name ras that 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:36.340
 it means fast hurry then good 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:39.550
 we will have to go 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:40.989
 very fast it's not going to be a map of many 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:43.629
 armed conflicts I do not know well what 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:45.459
 I just said but good and that's it 

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:47.610
 last map that is the apple inc 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:49.780
 set in their vitola the rhymes 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:52.360
 remastering that maybe it 's the one that 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:54.970
 more enthusiasm comes from watching me return 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:57.459
 to play at the costly take on the good 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:59.769
 let's move on to comment on the trailer 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:02.110
 zombies so good for saying things and 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:04.330
 various things is invented in the far 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:06.849
 west that zombies have eyes 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:09.190
 blue are we going to understand what 

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:10.959
 they are handled by faith not faith and 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:13.810
 what is also striking is 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:17.260
 what is the whiskey bottle 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:20.380
 and if he says that this will be like 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:22.720
 together and that there is a theory that they say 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:24.489
 that the four characters are going to 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:25.810
 die on that map and there is also a 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:28.360
 image that the four characters 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:30.519
 they appear behind some tombs that this 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:32.019
 I've read it in a comment from another of 

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:33.879
 another video and it has called me a lot 

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:35.709
 turn to the last map that 

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:37.870
 let's see these four characters together 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:39.579
 is the penultimate of him efe perhaps in the 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:41.769
 last of lc as they already appear 

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:42.730
 characters of always eristoff them in 

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:44.650
 maxis the 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:48.190
 those who have always been in zombies 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:49.930
 but good the zombie we go with him here in 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:52.000
 the far west the voice of this of saman 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:53.920
 of samantha who tells us that she receives us 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.629
 beginning and good then here in the far 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:58.090
 west underground that says here the 

00:03:55.629 --> 00:03:59.110
 creator that is a zombie map under 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:01.989
 land in the far west 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:03.700
 here you see the four tombs 

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:05.140
 four characters and there are pÃ¡ramos just the 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:07.750
 image because we have seen the new 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:10.540
 drink that will appear on this map there 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:12.940
 many speculations nobody knows 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:14.409
 the function that will do this is this 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:15.819
 new drink and also they have not put us 

00:04:14.409 --> 00:04:18.310
 here with the tits of the aunt is that 

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:19.780
 this is quite a comment 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:22.570
 from another video that said that drink 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:24.940
 it was dr pepper that exists in the in 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:27.550
 reality and that is to look at the packaging 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:29.680
 of that brand doctor pp do not tell me that 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:31.030
 it does not look like the symbol of the drink what 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:33.220
 that is striking is that it is 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:36.460
 red and no drink other than you get 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:39.820
 down was red and look at the container this 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:42.700
 of dr pepper as it seems 

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:44.080
 the coke or whatever this drink 

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:45.820
 because it has nothing to do with what is going 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:47.620
 to do in zombies but well we throw 

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:49.120
 with the trailer because it tells us here a 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:50.470
 very interesting thing that is going to be 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:53.110
 a new character that is going to 

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:55.060
 excite the fans and that we can 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:57.130
 use to our advantage or against me 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:59.350
 I would classify it as a kind of 

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:01.060
 george rosemary in web as in call 

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:03.520
 of the deep is not known and we'll see what 

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:05.830
 does and we pass with the new weapon of 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:07.660
 rays that a lot of people said I was going to 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:09.760
 be the special weapon of this map and that 

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:12.190
 it is totally false because according to this 

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:14.680
 image which comes to say that the weapon 

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:16.420
 of rays the frame jubes of the second 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:18.400
 ray gun can tell you so it goes 

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:20.020
 to be on all zombie maps 

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:22.090
 then if it is going to be in all not 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:24.610
 we know what it would be like if it would happen in the 

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:26.260
 tombola or if the 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:28.060
 normal roots do not know the truth 

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:30.250
 but what he does not understand is 

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:31.400
 that there's going to be another special weapon in that 

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:33.949
 Map 

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:35.750
 well then we continue with the trailers that 

00:05:33.949 --> 00:05:37.790
 the ray weapon is therefore tells us that 

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:40.190
 is a weapon to hold high rounds a 

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:42.530
 weapon since it gets pretty and basically 

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:43.820
 because it goes through whole waves and 

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:45.889
 we have a great ball of 

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:48.229
 zombies let's go through the surge 

00:05:45.889 --> 00:05:50.419
 whole with that connection as I say no 

00:05:48.229 --> 00:05:52.610
 I know that it will be achieved in the tombola if 

00:05:50.419 --> 00:05:54.470
 you could improve the truth that you do not 

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:56.530
 you know but that's basically what more 

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:59.870
 It has caught my attention on this map 

00:05:56.530 --> 00:06:02.270
 good note is worth a lot or very excited 

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:03.620
 for forming and not the dads the 

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:05.030
 new multiplayer maps and especially 

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:06.979
 the zombies that the truth that at 

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:08.449
 principle is pretty good to play them 

00:06:06.979 --> 00:06:10.100
 but you spend quite well and discovering 

00:06:08.449 --> 00:06:11.539
 there the interest and assured that the 

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:14.270
 character if you do not have it enough that 

00:06:11.539 --> 00:06:16.250
 see in the interest but good people this 

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:18.160
 has been everything I hope to the state the 

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:22.870
 video with much desire of this new dlc 

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:22.870
 nothing does not feel goodbye video
