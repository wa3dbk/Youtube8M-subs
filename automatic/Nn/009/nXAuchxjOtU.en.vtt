00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.089 
his career were not a big deal but they
are<00:02:08.300> a<00:02:08.330> big<00:02:08.750> deal<00:02:09.019> but<00:02:09.319> in<00:02:09.590> the<00:02:09.769> game<00:02:09.950> it

00:02:10.089 --> 00:02:10.099 
are a big deal but in the game it

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:11.830 
are a big deal but in the game it
doesn't<00:02:10.160> feel<00:02:10.550> that<00:02:10.610> way<00:02:10.849> and<00:02:11.269> I<00:02:11.360> think<00:02:11.629> that's

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
doesn't feel that way and I think that's

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.570 
doesn't feel that way and I think that's
what<00:02:12.019> this<00:02:12.140> game<00:02:12.379> is<00:02:12.410> missing<00:02:12.890> and<00:02:13.099> I<00:02:13.160> think<00:02:13.430> if

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
what this game is missing and I think if

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:15.910 
what this game is missing and I think if
they<00:02:13.730> focus<00:02:14.150> on<00:02:14.269> that<00:02:14.510> next<00:02:14.810> year<00:02:15.200> and<00:02:15.349> do

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
they focus on that next year and do

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:17.619 
they focus on that next year and do
something<00:02:16.310> like<00:02:16.430> a<00:02:16.489> nice<00:02:16.760> story<00:02:17.090> mode<00:02:17.390> with

00:02:17.619 --> 00:02:17.629 
something like a nice story mode with

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:19.479 
something like a nice story mode with
Tiger<00:02:18.080> this<00:02:18.349> has<00:02:18.590> potential<00:02:18.950> for<00:02:19.129> greatness

00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:19.489

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:18.910 
a game you know I think you guys should

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:19.980 
a game you know I think you guys should
be<00:05:19.090> a<00:05:19.120> little<00:05:19.240> bit<00:05:19.360> more<00:05:19.420> polish<00:05:19.720> than<00:05:19.870> that

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:19.990 
be a little bit more polish than that

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:22.290 
be a little bit more polish than that
that's<00:05:20.500> my<00:05:20.680> opinion<00:05:20.920> you<00:05:21.460> know<00:05:21.550> what<00:05:21.760> I<00:05:21.970> was

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:22.300 
that's my opinion you know what I was

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:24.720 
that's my opinion you know what I was
kinda<00:05:22.780> let<00:05:23.020> down<00:05:23.050> by<00:05:23.680> this<00:05:23.740> version<00:05:24.310> of<00:05:24.400> tiger

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:24.730 
kinda let down by this version of tiger

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:26.580 
kinda let down by this version of tiger
because<00:05:24.880> I<00:05:25.240> was<00:05:25.450> very<00:05:25.660> excited<00:05:25.840> for<00:05:26.470> the

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:26.590 
because I was very excited for the

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:29.010 
because I was very excited for the
legacy<00:05:27.040> mode<00:05:27.220> I<00:05:27.280> want<00:05:27.669> to<00:05:27.940> even<00:05:28.750> though<00:05:28.870> I<00:05:28.900> know

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:29.020 
legacy mode I want to even though I know

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:31.440

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:34.210 
know basically golfing since he could

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:36.000 
know basically golfing since he could
walk<00:05:34.480> and<00:05:34.870> you<00:05:34.930> know<00:05:35.020> hiding<00:05:35.320> in<00:05:35.590> the<00:05:35.710> ditches

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:41.290 
think there is great potential to make

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:42.780 
think there is great potential to make
an<00:05:41.440> amazing<00:05:41.710> interesting<00:05:42.280> story<00:05:42.490> I<00:05:42.520> mean<00:05:42.669> you

recommend to purchase for this the

00:06:01.419 --> 00:06:02.640 
recommend to purchase for this the
changes<00:06:01.720> are<00:06:01.810> not<00:06:01.960> strong<00:06:02.229> enough<00:06:02.260> for<00:06:02.470> a

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:02.650 
changes are not strong enough for a

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:04.170 
changes are not strong enough for a
purchase<00:06:02.890> in<00:06:03.220> my<00:06:03.250> opinion<00:06:03.340> what<00:06:04.000> is<00:06:04.030> the

strong<00:06:04.600> point<00:06:04.870> of<00:06:04.960> this<00:06:05.020> game<00:06:05.110> though<00:06:05.410> is

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:05.590 
strong point of this game though is

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:07.200 
strong point of this game though is
still<00:06:05.710> the<00:06:05.919> career<00:06:06.250> where<00:06:06.490> you<00:06:06.580> can<00:06:06.760> go<00:06:06.940> for

a long time by the way but totally worth

00:06:14.919 --> 00:06:16.290 
a long time by the way but totally worth
it<00:06:15.250> if<00:06:15.370> you<00:06:15.430> want<00:06:15.610> to<00:06:15.669> go<00:06:15.760> for<00:06:15.940> to<00:06:16.030> look<00:06:16.150> exactly

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:23.850 
they're adding on it's okay and it's
basically<00:06:21.600> doing<00:06:22.600> things<00:06:22.990> differently<00:06:23.470> but

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:23.860 
basically doing things differently but

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:25.800 
basically doing things differently but
achieving<00:06:24.550> the<00:06:24.669> same<00:06:24.880> things<00:06:25.330> like<00:06:25.660> they're

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:28.570 
trying to change it up at least thank

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:30.420 
trying to change it up at least thank
God<00:06:28.780> for<00:06:28.990> that<00:06:29.169> but<00:06:29.470> I<00:06:29.500> just<00:06:29.740> think<00:06:29.919> the<00:06:30.310> way

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:30.430 
God for that but I just think the way

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:31.920 
God for that but I just think the way
they<00:06:30.580> executed<00:06:31.090> it<00:06:31.210> didn't<00:06:31.570> work<00:06:31.720> especially

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:31.930 
they executed it didn't work especially

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:33.990 
they executed it didn't work especially
in<00:06:32.260> legacy<00:06:32.680> mode<00:06:32.860> playing<00:06:33.250> online<00:06:33.430> is<00:06:33.790> still

in legacy mode playing online is still

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.659 
in legacy mode playing online is still
fun<00:06:34.270> I<00:06:34.479> don't<00:06:34.780> think<00:06:34.870> there's<00:06:35.290> much<00:06:35.470> to<00:06:36.250> do<00:06:36.490> in

00:06:36.659 --> 00:06:36.669 
fun I don't think there's much to do in

00:06:36.669 --> 00:06:39.659
