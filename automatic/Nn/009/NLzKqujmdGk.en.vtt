paragraph closure and to touch upon the

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.290

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
main idea to give the reader the idea

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.299 
main idea to give the reader the idea
that<00:00:45.809> the<00:00:45.960> topic<00:00:46.320> is<00:00:46.469> now<00:00:46.620> finished<00:00:47.010> and<00:00:47.219> that

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
that the topic is now finished and that

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.910 
that the topic is now finished and that
you're<00:00:47.460> moving<00:00:47.760> on<00:00:47.850> to<00:00:47.910> something<00:00:48.270> else<00:00:48.920> okay

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
you're moving on to something else okay

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.360 
you're moving on to something else okay
so<00:00:50.000> the<00:00:51.000> entire<00:00:51.360> paragraph<00:00:51.809> stems<00:00:52.440> from<00:00:53.010> the

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
so the entire paragraph stems from the

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.790 
so the entire paragraph stems from the
topic<00:00:53.789> sentence<00:00:54.210> so<00:00:54.870> it's<00:00:55.020> very<00:00:55.170> really

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
topic sentence so it's very really

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.350 
topic sentence so it's very really
important<00:00:56.219> to<00:00:56.309> have<00:00:56.430> a<00:00:56.489> strong<00:00:56.879> topic

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
important to have a strong topic

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.450 
important to have a strong topic
sentence<00:00:57.690> let's<00:00:57.899> look<00:00:58.050> at<00:00:58.140> an<00:00:58.230> example<00:00:58.530> of<00:00:58.800> a

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
sentence let's look at an example of a

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.569 
sentence let's look at an example of a
good<00:00:59.640> one<00:01:00.410> taking<00:01:01.410> too<00:01:01.620> many<00:01:01.770> university

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
good one taking too many university

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.340 
good one taking too many university
courses<00:01:02.820> at<00:01:03.030> once<00:01:03.059> can<00:01:03.480> have<00:01:03.629> potentially

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
courses at once can have potentially

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.160 
courses at once can have potentially
serious<00:01:04.559> consequences<00:01:05.689> okay<00:01:06.689> so<00:01:06.750> this<00:01:06.960> is<00:01:07.140> a

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
serious consequences okay so this is a

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.810 
serious consequences okay so this is a
strong<00:01:07.500> topic<00:01:07.920> sentence<00:01:08.250> for<00:01:08.460> a<00:01:08.520> couple

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
reasons one it has a clear topic in this

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.620 
reasons one it has a clear topic in this
case<00:01:13.340> taken<00:01:14.340> to<00:01:14.460> any<00:01:14.610> university<00:01:15.180> courses<00:01:15.420> at

once
also<00:01:16.799> it<00:01:17.070> has<00:01:17.369> a<00:01:17.610> main<00:01:18.270> idea<00:01:18.479> in<00:01:19.100> this<00:01:20.100> case

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
also it has a main idea in this case

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.450 
also it has a main idea in this case
potentially<00:01:21.360> serious<00:01:21.570> consequences<00:01:22.460> it's

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
potentially serious consequences it's

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.370 
potentially serious consequences it's
also<00:01:23.640> effective<00:01:24.240> because<00:01:24.630> it<00:01:24.869> gives<00:01:25.140> the

right now let's look at for example

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:46.249 
right now let's look at for example
topic<00:01:43.530> sentences<00:01:44.250> you<00:01:45.060> can<00:01:45.090> even<00:01:45.329> pause<00:01:45.960> the

topic sentences you can even pause the

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.020 
topic sentences you can even pause the
video<00:01:46.500> for<00:01:46.560> a<00:01:46.799> minute<00:01:47.100> and<00:01:47.250> look<00:01:47.759> at<00:01:47.909> these

four<00:01:48.420> sentences<00:01:49.170> and<00:01:49.619> decide<00:01:50.009> which<00:01:50.430> do<00:01:50.790> you

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
four sentences and decide which do you

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.240 
four sentences and decide which do you
think<00:01:51.149> is<00:01:51.270> the<00:01:51.420> strongest<00:01:51.990> topic<00:01:52.890> sentence

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250

you

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:05.440 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.330 

alright<00:02:06.440> that<00:02:06.590> was<00:02:06.620> actually<00:02:07.040> a<00:02:07.070> bit<00:02:07.190> of<00:02:07.220> a

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 
alright that was actually a bit of a

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:09.760 
alright that was actually a bit of a
trick<00:02:07.550> question<00:02:07.940> because<00:02:08.500> none<00:02:09.500> of<00:02:09.530> these

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:09.770 
trick question because none of these

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:11.890 
trick question because none of these
four<00:02:09.979> sentences<00:02:10.220> are<00:02:11.060> strong<00:02:11.450> topic

four sentences are strong topic

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.410
