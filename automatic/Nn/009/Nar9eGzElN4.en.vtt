00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
here now so those are collards on this

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.900 
here now so those are collards on this
side<00:00:42.410> I've<00:00:43.410> planned<00:00:43.829> them<00:00:43.980> maybe<00:00:44.430> too<00:00:44.700> close

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
side I've planned them maybe too close

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.549 
side I've planned them maybe too close
they<00:00:45.329> did<00:00:45.450> okay<00:00:45.780> last<00:00:46.079> year<00:00:46.260> doing<00:00:46.440> this

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
they did okay last year doing this

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.220 
they did okay last year doing this
weather<00:00:46.829> about<00:00:47.129> a<00:00:47.160> foot<00:00:47.579> to<00:00:47.879> 14<00:00:48.360> 16<00:00:48.899> inches

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
weather about a foot to 14 16 inches

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.549 
weather about a foot to 14 16 inches
apart<00:00:49.559> in<00:00:50.039> various<00:00:50.370> places<00:00:50.520> and<00:00:51.469> maybe<00:00:52.469> I

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
apart in various places and maybe I

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:53.840 
apart in various places and maybe I
should<00:00:52.739> have<00:00:52.860> done<00:00:52.980> two<00:00:53.219> rows<00:00:53.430> rather<00:00:53.730> than

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
should have done two rows rather than

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.250 
should have done two rows rather than
three<00:00:54.120> but<00:00:54.270> I<00:00:54.360> had<00:00:54.480> a<00:00:54.510> whole<00:00:54.660> lot<00:00:54.780> of<00:00:54.870> collards

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
three but I had a whole lot of collards

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.470 
three but I had a whole lot of collards
I<00:00:55.320> think<00:00:55.469> it<00:00:55.559> kind<00:00:55.739> of<00:00:55.770> over<00:00:56.039> bought<00:00:56.219> those<00:00:56.520> so

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
I think it kind of over bought those so

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.920 
I think it kind of over bought those so
I'm<00:00:57.570> I'm<00:00:58.109> going<00:00:58.289> to<00:00:58.350> see<00:00:59.010> how<00:00:59.190> these<00:00:59.399> do<00:00:59.930> they

started<00:02:21.400> real<00:02:21.640> little<00:02:21.879> about<00:02:22.180> maybe<00:02:22.659> foot

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:22.989 
started real little about maybe foot

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:25.770 
started real little about maybe foot
tall<00:02:23.909> it's<00:02:24.909> another<00:02:25.120> some<00:02:25.510> of<00:02:25.629> them<00:02:25.720> are

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
well all of these leaves here I'm not

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:35.490 
well all of these leaves here I'm not
sure<00:02:34.239> what's<00:02:34.510> getting<00:02:34.750> hold<00:02:34.989> of<00:02:35.079> those<00:02:35.230> some

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
sure what's getting hold of those some

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.160 
sure what's getting hold of those some
of<00:02:35.530> those<00:02:35.650> key<00:02:35.829> folks<00:02:36.069> who<00:02:36.629> grow<00:02:37.629> grapes<00:02:37.930> might

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
of those key folks who grow grapes might

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:39.330 
of those key folks who grow grapes might
be<00:02:38.290> able<00:02:38.349> to<00:02:38.470> tell<00:02:38.590> me<00:02:38.650> what's<00:02:38.829> happening<00:02:39.220> here

with<00:02:39.489> this<00:02:39.549> leaf<00:02:40.290> well<00:02:41.290> if<00:02:41.379> it's<00:02:41.500> a<00:02:41.560> fungus<00:02:41.829> or

00:02:42.119 --> 00:02:42.129 
with this leaf well if it's a fungus or

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:45.180 
with this leaf well if it's a fungus or
some<00:02:42.340> sort<00:02:42.579> of<00:02:42.670> the<00:02:42.879> bug<00:02:43.680> that's<00:02:44.680> doing<00:02:44.980> that

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
some sort of the bug that's doing that

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:47.339 
some sort of the bug that's doing that
we<00:02:46.090> have<00:02:46.180> roses<00:02:46.629> growing<00:02:46.870> beside<00:02:47.049> them

00:02:47.339 --> 00:02:47.349 
we have roses growing beside them

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:48.899 
we have roses growing beside them
because<00:02:47.560> nikki<00:02:47.889> has<00:02:48.250> read<00:02:48.459> somewhere<00:02:48.849> that

00:02:48.899 --> 00:02:48.909 
because nikki has read somewhere that

00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:51.030 
because nikki has read somewhere that
it's<00:02:49.090> good<00:02:49.269> for<00:02:49.480> register<00:02:49.840> growth<00:02:50.019> that<00:02:50.319> it

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
it's good for register growth that it

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.030 
it's good for register growth that it
allows<00:02:51.250> you<00:02:51.430> to<00:02:51.519> see<00:02:51.730> what's<00:02:52.060> a<00:02:52.859> two-pin<00:02:53.859> that

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
allows you to see what's a two-pin that

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.940 
allows you to see what's a two-pin that
it<00:02:54.569> it<00:02:55.569> allows<00:02:55.780> you<00:02:55.900> to<00:02:56.019> tell<00:02:56.200> them<00:02:56.349> blots<00:02:56.650> and

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
it it allows you to tell them blots and

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:58.349 
it it allows you to tell them blots and
various<00:02:57.280> things<00:02:57.310> are<00:02:57.639> getting<00:02:58.120> ready<00:02:58.269> to

00:02:58.349 --> 00:02:58.359 
various things are getting ready to

00:02:58.359 --> 00:03:00.300 
various things are getting ready to
happen<00:02:58.540> it<00:02:58.840> gets<00:02:59.379> to<00:02:59.530> the<00:02:59.620> roses<00:02:59.950> before<00:03:00.099> it

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
happen it gets to the roses before it

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:04.020 
happen it gets to the roses before it
gets<00:03:00.489> to<00:03:00.639> the<00:03:00.730> grapes<00:03:01.799> so<00:03:02.799> yeah<00:03:03.040> I<00:03:03.370> don't<00:03:03.939> know

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
gets to the grapes so yeah I don't know

I<00:03:58.900> guess<00:03:59.049> probably<00:03:59.440> I<00:03:59.859> cut<00:04:00.639> it<00:04:00.760> loose<00:04:00.909> in

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:01.120 
I guess probably I cut it loose in

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:03.449 
I guess probably I cut it loose in
october<00:04:01.690> and<00:04:01.810> and<00:04:02.019> I'll<00:04:02.979> if<00:04:03.129> we<00:04:03.220> use<00:04:03.340> it<00:04:03.430> for

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:03.459 
october and and I'll if we use it for

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:05.219 
october and and I'll if we use it for
jack<00:04:03.760> o'lantern<00:04:04.000> and<00:04:04.329> i<00:04:04.419> think<00:04:04.780> probably<00:04:04.989> not

00:04:05.219 --> 00:04:05.229 
jack o'lantern and i think probably not

00:04:05.229 --> 00:04:07.589 
jack o'lantern and i think probably not
it's<00:04:05.409> really<00:04:05.620> good<00:04:05.829> cooking<00:04:06.299> pumpkin<00:04:07.299> needing

it's really good cooking pumpkin needing
that<00:04:07.720> when<00:04:07.870> they<00:04:07.959> might<00:04:08.139> actually<00:04:08.440> buy<00:04:08.829> a

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:08.859 
that when they might actually buy a

00:04:08.859 --> 00:04:11.990 
that when they might actually buy a
couple<00:04:09.220> I<00:04:09.340> matru<00:04:09.609> used<00:04:09.849> for<00:04:10.030> jack<00:04:10.239> o'lantern

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000
