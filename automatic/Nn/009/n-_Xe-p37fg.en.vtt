know that if you pack a punch them you
might<00:00:43.710> be<00:00:43.890> able<00:00:44.010> to<00:00:44.340> have<00:00:44.700> a<00:00:44.730> blast<00:00:45.030> radius<00:00:45.239> but

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
might be able to have a blast radius but

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.779 
might be able to have a blast radius but
as<00:00:45.690> it<00:00:45.809> is<00:00:45.899> right<00:00:46.050> now<00:00:46.110> unpack<00:00:46.860> a<00:00:46.890> punched<00:00:47.399> they

does one at a time now the secondary to

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.529 
does one at a time now the secondary to
this<00:00:59.219> is<00:00:59.399> the<00:00:59.579> wave<00:00:59.789> gun<00:01:00.000> and<00:01:00.180> I<00:01:00.210> will<00:01:00.329> get<00:01:00.420> to

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
this is the wave gun and I will get to

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.479 
this is the wave gun and I will get to
that<00:01:00.570> in<00:01:00.719> a<00:01:00.840> second<00:01:01.230> but<00:01:01.350> basically<00:01:01.859> what<00:01:02.460> that

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
that in a second but basically what that

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.000 
that in a second but basically what that
is<00:01:02.670> it's<00:01:03.120> like<00:01:03.420> a<00:01:03.660> gun<00:01:04.110> that's<00:01:04.320> an<00:01:04.500> attachment

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
is it's like a gun that's an attachment

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.539 
is it's like a gun that's an attachment
to<00:01:05.369> it<00:01:05.400> the<00:01:05.970> zap<00:01:06.299> guns<00:01:06.570> and<00:01:06.780> it's<00:01:07.500> very<00:01:08.159> cool<00:01:08.369> so

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
to it the zap guns and it's very cool so

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.179 
to it the zap guns and it's very cool so
it's<00:01:08.580> like<00:01:08.790> two<00:01:08.939> guns<00:01:09.150> in<00:01:09.330> one<00:01:09.510> zap<00:01:10.439> guns<00:01:10.740> they

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
it's like two guns in one zap guns they

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.210 
it's like two guns in one zap guns they
have<00:01:11.520> eight<00:01:12.240> bullets<00:01:12.750> per<00:01:13.170> round<00:01:13.380> per<00:01:13.799> gun<00:01:14.040> so

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
have eight bullets per round per gun so

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.770 
have eight bullets per round per gun so
you<00:01:14.310> get<00:01:14.400> 16<00:01:14.729> bullets<00:01:14.939> in<00:01:15.180> total<00:01:15.479> before<00:01:15.720> you

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
you get 16 bullets in total before you

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.920 
you get 16 bullets in total before you
have<00:01:15.930> to<00:01:16.080> reload<00:01:16.470> and<00:01:16.710> you<00:01:16.979> have<00:01:17.420> 1664<00:01:18.420> bullets

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
have to reload and you have 1664 bullets

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.020 
have to reload and you have 1664 bullets

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.940 
backup weapon so you got a lot of ammo
and<00:01:21.210> that's<00:01:21.780> very<00:01:22.049> good<00:01:22.259> you'll<00:01:22.650> notice<00:01:22.860> that

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
I use a black hole right there that

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.429 
I use a black hole right there that

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
grenade launcher pretty much you hit the

grenade launcher pretty much you hit the
left<00:01:55.920> d-pad<00:01:56.369> and<00:01:56.549> then<00:01:57.240> you<00:01:57.360> get<00:01:57.509> to<00:01:57.540> have<00:01:57.719> the

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
left d-pad and then you get to have the

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.410 
left d-pad and then you get to have the
rake<00:01:58.110> wave<00:01:58.439> gun<00:01:58.770> out<00:01:59.009> so<00:01:59.790> what<00:01:59.939> it<00:02:00.060> does<00:02:00.180> is<00:02:00.390> it

that<00:02:13.700> we<00:02:13.790> found<00:02:13.970> in<00:02:14.150> the<00:02:14.240> box<00:02:14.480> is<00:02:14.690> this<00:02:14.900> weird

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
that we found in the box is this weird

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.710 
that we found in the box is this weird
sort<00:02:15.620> of<00:02:15.800> secondary<00:02:16.490> equipment<00:02:17.120> I<00:02:17.240> just<00:02:17.600> got

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
sort of secondary equipment I just got

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.540 
sort of secondary equipment I just got
it<00:02:17.870> right<00:02:17.960> now<00:02:18.020> right<00:02:18.620> there<00:02:18.890> it<00:02:19.220> kind<00:02:19.520> of

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:19.550 
it right now right there it kind of

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:23.050 
it right now right there it kind of
looks<00:02:19.610> like<00:02:19.760> an<00:02:19.940> electric<00:02:20.300> dildo<00:02:21.250> very<00:02:22.250> random

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
looks like an electric dildo very random

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:24.670 
looks like an electric dildo very random
and<00:02:23.270> weird<00:02:23.330> looking<00:02:23.930> not<00:02:24.110> quite<00:02:24.320> sure<00:02:24.350> what

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
and weird looking not quite sure what

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.710 
and weird looking not quite sure what
this<00:02:24.800> does<00:02:25.010> I<00:02:25.220> think<00:02:25.700> what<00:02:25.850> it<00:02:25.940> does<00:02:26.090> so<00:02:26.300> far<00:02:26.540> is

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 
this does I think what it does so far is

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.900 
this does I think what it does so far is
just<00:02:26.930> emits<00:02:27.350> like<00:02:27.530> a<00:02:27.560> shockwave<00:02:27.920> and<00:02:28.280> makes

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
just emits like a shockwave and makes

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:31.030 
just emits like a shockwave and makes
the<00:02:29.000> zombies<00:02:29.360> fly<00:02:29.600> away<00:02:29.870> from<00:02:30.080> it<00:02:30.230> so<00:02:30.800> it's<00:02:30.980> a

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
the zombies fly away from it so it's a

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:32.020 
the zombies fly away from it so it's a
very<00:02:31.070> useful<00:02:31.340> tool<00:02:31.640> if<00:02:31.730> you're<00:02:31.850> getting

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
very useful tool if you're getting

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:33.160 
very useful tool if you're getting
overrun<00:02:32.270> you<00:02:32.480> can<00:02:32.600> just<00:02:32.720> throw<00:02:32.780> it<00:02:32.990> on<00:02:33.050> the

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
overrun you can just throw it on the

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:34.570 
overrun you can just throw it on the
ground<00:02:33.320> the<00:02:33.530> zombies<00:02:33.860> will<00:02:33.890> fly<00:02:34.220> away<00:02:34.310> from

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.580 
ground the zombies will fly away from

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:36.160 
ground the zombies will fly away from
you<00:02:34.670> as<00:02:34.850> you<00:02:34.880> saw<00:02:35.120> I<00:02:35.150> failed<00:02:35.480> with<00:02:35.690> it<00:02:35.840> so<00:02:35.990> the

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
you as you saw I failed with it so the

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:38.770 
you as you saw I failed with it so the
blast<00:02:36.380> radius<00:02:36.500> is<00:02:36.830> not<00:02:37.010> very<00:02:37.250> large<00:02:37.340> so<00:02:37.790> far<00:02:38.000> as

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
blast radius is not very large so far as

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:40.390 
blast radius is not very large so far as
far<00:02:39.020> as<00:02:39.140> I<00:02:39.200> can<00:02:39.260> tell<00:02:39.380> but<00:02:39.680> I<00:02:39.740> get<00:02:40.040> it<00:02:40.130> closer<00:02:40.280> to

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
far as I can tell but I get it closer to

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:41.830 
far as I can tell but I get it closer to
him<00:02:40.550> there<00:02:40.730> and<00:02:40.880> see<00:02:41.060> lucky<00:02:41.300> flies<00:02:41.540> backwards

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
him there and see lucky flies backwards

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.170 
him there and see lucky flies backwards
so<00:02:42.290> it's<00:02:42.770> a<00:02:42.800> very<00:02:42.830> neat<00:02:43.190> equipment<00:02:43.640> and<00:02:43.790> I

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.180 
so it's a very neat equipment and I

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:46.000 
so it's a very neat equipment and I
don't<00:02:44.630> find<00:02:44.870> it<00:02:44.990> useful<00:02:45.320> at<00:02:45.410> this<00:02:45.560> point<00:02:45.830> I

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
don't find it useful at this point I

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:47.620 
don't find it useful at this point I
find<00:02:46.220> the<00:02:46.400> black<00:02:46.820> holes<00:02:47.060> to<00:02:47.210> be<00:02:47.300> more<00:02:47.480> useful

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:47.630 
find the black holes to be more useful

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:48.790 
find the black holes to be more useful
but<00:02:47.960> who<00:02:48.080> knows<00:02:48.200> maybe<00:02:48.410> you<00:02:48.560> need<00:02:48.680> them<00:02:48.770> for

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:48.800 
but who knows maybe you need them for
