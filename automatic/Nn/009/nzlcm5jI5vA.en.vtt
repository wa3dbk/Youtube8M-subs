I really like about it is that it's
slightly<00:00:43.170> beefier<00:00:43.800> than<00:00:43.860> Nana<00:00:44.340> it's<00:00:44.730> slightly

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
slightly beefier than Nana it's slightly

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:51.470 
slightly beefier than Nana it's slightly
longer<00:00:45.329> and<00:00:47.780> see<00:00:48.780> with<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.410> Mallard<00:00:50.480> it

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
actually things out along this the most

level<00:01:11.930> of<00:01:12.020> detail<00:01:12.350> is<00:01:12.470> really<00:01:12.619> very<00:01:12.950> nice<00:01:14.140> it's

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:15.140 
level of detail is really very nice it's

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:16.960 
level of detail is really very nice it's
one<00:01:15.470> of<00:01:15.500> Hornby's<00:01:16.070> super<00:01:16.369> detail<00:01:16.640> arrange

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:16.970 
one of Hornby's super detail arrange

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:20.310 
one of Hornby's super detail arrange
that<00:01:17.420> are<00:01:17.570> available<00:01:17.960> now<00:01:18.880> it's<00:01:19.880> a<00:01:19.909> bit<00:01:20.030> dusty

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:20.320 
that are available now it's a bit dusty

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:24.609 
that are available now it's a bit dusty
that<00:01:21.850> one<00:01:22.850> bit<00:01:23.090> that<00:01:23.270> is<00:01:23.630> is<00:01:23.930> really<00:01:24.259> rather

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:24.619 
that one bit that is is really rather

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:25.990 
that one bit that is is really rather
unconvincing<00:01:25.009> I<00:01:25.220> don't<00:01:25.369> know<00:01:25.460> what<00:01:25.549> it<00:01:25.640> is

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:26.000 
unconvincing I don't know what it is

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.380 
unconvincing I don't know what it is
right<00:01:26.390> underneath<00:01:26.750> this<00:01:27.789> iron<00:01:28.789> whatever<00:01:29.240> that

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:29.390 
right underneath this iron whatever that

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.850 
right underneath this iron whatever that
is<00:01:29.570> for<00:01:29.799> this<00:01:30.799> bit<00:01:31.039> here<00:01:31.369> that<00:01:32.440> broke<00:01:33.440> it's

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:33.860 
is for this bit here that broke it's

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:35.710 
is for this bit here that broke it's
supposed<00:01:34.159> to<00:01:34.220> have<00:01:34.399> a<00:01:34.429> little<00:01:34.729> thing<00:01:35.569> which

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:35.720 
supposed to have a little thing which

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.169 
supposed to have a little thing which
pokes<00:01:36.050> down<00:01:36.289> and<00:01:36.590> gives<00:01:37.130> you<00:01:37.220> access<00:01:37.399> to<00:01:37.640> the<00:01:37.819> I

00:01:38.169 --> 00:01:38.179 
pokes down and gives you access to the I

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:40.389 
pokes down and gives you access to the I
think<00:01:38.630> that<00:01:38.720> unlocks<00:01:39.110> the<00:01:39.380> the<00:01:39.710> front<00:01:39.950> bit<00:01:40.220> so

00:01:40.389 --> 00:01:40.399 
think that unlocks the the front bit so

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:42.279 
think that unlocks the the front bit so
you<00:01:40.490> can<00:01:40.520> you<00:01:40.909> can<00:01:41.090> open<00:01:41.479> it<00:01:41.569> up<00:01:41.659> and<00:01:41.929> get

00:01:42.279 --> 00:01:42.289 
you can you can open it up and get

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:44.559 
you can you can open it up and get
access<00:01:42.440> to<00:01:42.649> the<00:01:42.770> boiler<00:01:43.130> but<00:01:43.850> that's<00:01:44.240> broken

00:01:44.559 --> 00:01:44.569 
access to the boiler but that's broken

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:48.820 
access to the boiler but that's broken
off<00:01:46.659> it<00:01:47.659> broke<00:01:47.899> off<00:01:48.050> in<00:01:48.259> the<00:01:48.350> packaging

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:48.830 
off it broke off in the packaging

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:50.850 
off it broke off in the packaging
unfortunately<00:01:49.429> on<00:01:49.520> its<00:01:49.700> on<00:01:49.850> its<00:01:50.000> way<00:01:50.149> to<00:01:50.210> me<00:01:50.509> I

unfortunately on its on its way to me I

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.440 
unfortunately on its on its way to me I
mean<00:01:51.860> you<00:01:52.069> can<00:01:52.250> make<00:01:52.429> a<00:01:52.460> new<00:01:52.670> one<00:01:52.850> out<00:01:52.880> of<00:01:53.060> out

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 
mean you can make a new one out of out

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:56.800 
mean you can make a new one out of out
of<00:01:53.659> just<00:01:53.869> anything<00:01:54.350> really<00:01:54.530> but<00:01:55.690> just<00:01:56.690> to<00:01:56.780> warn

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
of just anything really but just to warn

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:58.749 
of just anything really but just to warn
you<00:01:57.170> that<00:01:57.200> it's<00:01:57.530> if<00:01:57.830> you<00:01:58.039> if<00:01:58.340> you're<00:01:58.490> thinking

you that it's if you if you're thinking

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:00.580 
you that it's if you if you're thinking
of<00:01:58.819> getting<00:01:58.970> one<00:01:59.119> there<00:01:59.840> are<00:01:59.959> some<00:02:00.200> bits<00:02:00.440> which

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
of getting one there are some bits which

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:02.260 
of getting one there are some bits which
are<00:02:00.740> fairly<00:02:00.890> flimsy<00:02:01.190> and<00:02:01.549> will<00:02:01.759> probably<00:02:02.119> come

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270 
are fairly flimsy and will probably come

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:03.789 
are fairly flimsy and will probably come
off<00:02:02.420> and<00:02:02.600> require<00:02:02.899> a<00:02:02.929> replacement<00:02:03.530> at<00:02:03.619> some

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:03.799 
off and require a replacement at some

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:07.660 
off and require a replacement at some
point<00:02:04.479> running<00:02:05.479> wise<00:02:05.750> really<00:02:06.350> nothing<00:02:07.219> extra

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:07.670 
point running wise really nothing extra

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.150 
point running wise really nothing extra
to<00:02:07.700> say<00:02:07.989> because<00:02:08.989> the<00:02:09.350> same<00:02:09.590> things<00:02:09.979> which

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 
to say because the same things which

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.550 
to say because the same things which
applies<00:02:10.429> with<00:02:10.670> Mal<00:02:10.880> are<00:02:11.230> really<00:02:12.230> applying

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
applies with Mal are really applying

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.270 
applies with Mal are really applying
yeah<00:02:13.000> it<00:02:14.000> doesn't<00:02:14.360> like<00:02:14.769> small<00:02:15.769> turning

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
yeah it doesn't like small turning

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.310 
yeah it doesn't like small turning
circles<00:02:16.730> which<00:02:17.420> makes<00:02:17.630> arrangements<00:02:17.840> going

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:18.320 
circles which makes arrangements going

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:19.509 
circles which makes arrangements going
backwards<00:02:18.680> or<00:02:18.769> something<00:02:19.040> somewhere<00:02:19.310> from

00:02:19.509 --> 00:02:19.519 
backwards or something somewhere from

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:22.420 
backwards or something somewhere from
there<00:02:19.670> probably<00:02:19.940> piss<00:02:20.060> might<00:02:20.269> not<00:02:20.920> know<00:02:21.920> every

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.900 
the maillard had some problems it had a
little<00:02:32.600> piston<00:02:33.109> at<00:02:33.260> the<00:02:33.320> back<00:02:33.500> here<00:02:34.010> that<00:02:34.700> was

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:34.910 
little piston at the back here that was

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:37.150 
little piston at the back here that was
connecting<00:02:35.420> that<00:02:35.540> up<00:02:36.140> to<00:02:36.290> the<00:02:36.410> body<00:02:36.620> here<00:02:36.980> that

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160 
connecting that up to the body here that

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.060 
connecting that up to the body here that
was<00:02:37.280> actually<00:02:37.880> jamming<00:02:38.570> and<00:02:38.890> creating<00:02:39.890> some

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:40.070 
was actually jamming and creating some

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:42.039 
was actually jamming and creating some
real<00:02:40.220> problems<00:02:40.459> so<00:02:41.450> I<00:02:41.480> actually<00:02:41.690> took<00:02:41.870> that

00:02:42.039 --> 00:02:42.049 
real problems so I actually took that

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:45.069 
real problems so I actually took that
off<00:02:42.380> just<00:02:42.410> just<00:02:43.070> I've<00:02:43.790> kept<00:02:44.329> it<00:02:44.480> just<00:02:44.510> just<00:02:44.959> in

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:45.079 
off just just I've kept it just just in

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:46.569 
off just just I've kept it just just in
case<00:02:45.260> I<00:02:45.380> can<00:02:45.530> work<00:02:45.920> out<00:02:46.040> how<00:02:46.100> to<00:02:46.220> fix<00:02:46.459> it

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:46.579 
case I can work out how to fix it

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:51.370 
case I can work out how to fix it
somehow<00:02:46.820> but<00:02:47.180> yeah<00:02:47.840> really<00:02:48.200> really<00:02:50.200> not<00:02:51.200> very

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:51.380 
somehow but yeah really really not very

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:54.610 
somehow but yeah really really not very
good<00:02:51.560> I<00:02:52.750> think<00:02:53.750> this<00:02:53.959> is<00:02:54.079> one<00:02:54.200> of<00:02:54.230> the<00:02:54.350> nicer

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
good I think this is one of the nicer

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:56.349 
good I think this is one of the nicer
Hornby<00:02:55.190> engines<00:02:55.609> that<00:02:55.760> they've<00:02:55.910> done<00:02:56.150> they've

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:56.359 
Hornby engines that they've done they've

00:02:56.359 --> 00:02:57.940 
Hornby engines that they've done they've
done<00:02:56.540> lots<00:02:56.840> of<00:02:56.959> versions<00:02:57.320> of<00:02:57.440> this<00:02:57.560> over<00:02:57.859> the

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 
done lots of versions of this over the

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:00.069 
done lots of versions of this over the
years<00:02:58.190> but<00:02:58.489> this<00:02:58.609> is<00:02:58.760> probably<00:02:59.030> the<00:02:59.780> best<00:02:59.959> one

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:00.079 
years but this is probably the best one

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:04.599 
years but this is probably the best one
they've<00:03:00.290> ever<00:03:00.350> done<00:03:00.470> yet<00:03:03.190> yeah<00:03:04.190> the<00:03:04.340> level<00:03:04.549> of

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:04.609 
they've ever done yet yeah the level of

00:03:04.609 --> 00:03:05.949 
they've ever done yet yeah the level of
detail<00:03:04.850> at<00:03:04.940> the<00:03:05.000> front<00:03:05.180> is<00:03:05.269> really<00:03:05.569> very<00:03:05.810> nice

00:03:05.949 --> 00:03:05.959 
detail at the front is really very nice

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:08.500 
detail at the front is really very nice
you've<00:03:06.920> got<00:03:07.100> all<00:03:07.579> kinds<00:03:07.790> of<00:03:07.850> hoses<00:03:08.299> and

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 
you've got all kinds of hoses and

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:11.050 
you've got all kinds of hoses and
coupler<00:03:08.870> bits<00:03:09.079> and<00:03:09.380> and<00:03:09.620> obviously<00:03:10.060> these

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
coupler bits and and obviously these

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:15.360 
coupler bits and and obviously these
lamp<00:03:11.389> irons<00:03:11.750> are<00:03:11.900> quite<00:03:12.109> nice

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:17.890 

sprung<00:03:16.370> buffers<00:03:16.819> I<00:03:17.060> always<00:03:17.239> liked<00:03:17.420> those<00:03:17.630> bits

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:17.900 
sprung buffers I always liked those bits

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:22.059 
sprung buffers I always liked those bits
I<00:03:19.900> can't<00:03:20.900> remember<00:03:21.140> whether<00:03:21.410> this<00:03:21.620> is<00:03:21.770> kind<00:03:21.980> of

00:03:22.059 --> 00:03:22.069 
I can't remember whether this is kind of

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:26.740 
I can't remember whether this is kind of
tab<00:03:23.060> went<00:03:23.510> the<00:03:23.630> now<00:03:23.810> odd<00:03:25.209> will<00:03:26.209> the<00:03:26.360> moldings

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
tab went the now odd will the moldings

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:27.910 
tab went the now odd will the moldings
all<00:03:26.900> there<00:03:27.110> it's<00:03:27.349> just<00:03:27.410> none<00:03:27.590> of<00:03:27.620> it's<00:03:27.800> been

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:27.920 
all there it's just none of it's been

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.160 
all there it's just none of it's been
painted<00:03:28.400> so<00:03:28.760> well<00:03:29.630> if<00:03:29.840> you're<00:03:29.930> gonna<00:03:30.019> be

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:30.170 
painted so well if you're gonna be

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:33.670 
painted so well if you're gonna be
bothered<00:03:30.530> I<00:03:30.650> guess<00:03:30.830> you<00:03:31.040> could<00:03:31.220> you<00:03:32.150> could<00:03:32.680> get

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:33.680 
bothered I guess you could you could get

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.290 
bothered I guess you could you could get
in<00:03:33.860> there<00:03:34.040> and<00:03:34.190> paint<00:03:34.400> all<00:03:34.550> that<00:03:34.760> but<00:03:35.030> I<00:03:35.180> don't

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:35.300 
in there and paint all that but I don't

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:36.610 
in there and paint all that but I don't
you<00:03:35.540> know<00:03:35.660> you're<00:03:35.810> not<00:03:35.870> gonna<00:03:36.050> see<00:03:36.319> you<00:03:36.440> never

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:36.620 
you know you're not gonna see you never

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:38.710 
you know you're not gonna see you never
sir<00:03:36.980> don't<00:03:37.819> think<00:03:37.970> there's<00:03:38.120> that<00:03:38.180> much<00:03:38.450> of<00:03:38.660> a

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:38.720 
sir don't think there's that much of a

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:42.400 
sir don't think there's that much of a
reason<00:03:38.900> to<00:03:39.110> paint<00:03:39.950> it<00:03:40.099> all<00:03:40.750> so<00:03:41.750> yes<00:03:41.959> all<00:03:42.170> in<00:03:42.290> all

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:42.410 
reason to paint it all so yes all in all

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:46.170 
reason to paint it all so yes all in all
it's<00:03:42.560> a<00:03:42.680> it's<00:03:42.980> a<00:03:43.069> very<00:03:43.400> nice<00:03:44.680> modeled<00:03:45.680> have

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.180 
it's a it's a very nice modeled have

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:49.660 
it's a it's a very nice modeled have
never<00:03:47.180> had<00:03:47.390> any<00:03:47.569> trouble<00:03:47.989> with<00:03:48.019> it<00:03:48.640> had<00:03:49.640> a

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:49.670 
never had any trouble with it had a

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:50.830 
never had any trouble with it had a
little<00:03:49.850> bit<00:03:50.000> of<00:03:50.060> trouble<00:03:50.269> with<00:03:50.480> the<00:03:50.540> mallard

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840 
little bit of trouble with the mallard

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.729 
little bit of trouble with the mallard
with<00:03:51.019> at<00:03:51.110> one<00:03:51.260> time<00:03:51.440> with<00:03:51.620> the<00:03:51.650> Pistons<00:03:52.610> and

00:03:53.729 --> 00:03:53.739 
with at one time with the Pistons and

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:56.530 
with at one time with the Pistons and
bit<00:03:54.739> of<00:03:54.830> pulling<00:03:55.040> power<00:03:55.280> trouble<00:03:55.700> this<00:03:56.360> one

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:56.540 
bit of pulling power trouble this one

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:57.910 
bit of pulling power trouble this one
doesn't<00:03:56.690> have<00:03:56.780> so<00:03:56.989> much<00:03:57.110> pulling<00:03:57.470> pulling

00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:57.920 
doesn't have so much pulling pulling

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:59.500 
doesn't have so much pulling pulling
power<00:03:58.130> trouble<00:03:58.549> right<00:03:58.670> I<00:03:58.849> think<00:03:59.090> it's<00:03:59.269> really

00:03:59.500 --> 00:03:59.510 
power trouble right I think it's really

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:04.990 
power trouble right I think it's really
not<00:04:02.590> the<00:04:03.590> only<00:04:04.069> ones<00:04:04.250> really<00:04:04.459> aren't<00:04:04.640> designed

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:05.000 
not the only ones really aren't designed

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.430 
not the only ones really aren't designed
to<00:04:05.120> do<00:04:05.269> much<00:04:05.420> of<00:04:05.569> an<00:04:05.630> incline<00:04:05.989> even<00:04:06.319> though

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:06.440 
to do much of an incline even though

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:10.240 
to do much of an incline even though
they<00:04:06.680> they<00:04:06.980> sell<00:04:07.280> you<00:04:07.489> peers<00:04:08.200> annoyingly<00:04:09.250> now

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:10.250 
they they sell you peers annoyingly now

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:12.280 
they they sell you peers annoyingly now
in<00:04:10.430> three<00:04:10.730> bits<00:04:11.000> you<00:04:11.209> have<00:04:11.360> to<00:04:11.450> buy<00:04:11.569> up<00:04:11.870> peers

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:12.290 
in three bits you have to buy up peers

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:14.530 
in three bits you have to buy up peers
along<00:04:12.890> peers<00:04:13.220> and<00:04:13.459> then<00:04:13.670> damp<00:04:13.970> it<00:04:14.209> is<00:04:14.360> they

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:14.540 
along peers and then damp it is they

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:18.039 
along peers and then damp it is they
don't<00:04:14.750> just<00:04:14.870> come<00:04:15.019> in<00:04:15.080> one<00:04:15.230> package<00:04:15.650> more<00:04:17.049> but

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:18.049 
don't just come in one package more but

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:20.680 
don't just come in one package more but
they<00:04:18.140> sell<00:04:18.350> your<00:04:18.530> peers<00:04:18.769> which<00:04:19.450> in<00:04:20.450> the

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:20.690 
they sell your peers which in the

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:22.810 
they sell your peers which in the
inclined<00:04:20.989> peers<00:04:21.260> which<00:04:21.470> I<00:04:21.709> think<00:04:22.280> the<00:04:22.430> the

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:22.820 
inclined peers which I think the the

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:26.740 
inclined peers which I think the the
lowest<00:04:23.260> grade<00:04:24.260> that<00:04:24.680> they'll<00:04:24.919> let<00:04:25.190> you<00:04:25.400> do<00:04:26.390> is

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:26.750 
lowest grade that they'll let you do is

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:30.670 
lowest grade that they'll let you do is
like<00:04:27.140> a<00:04:27.289> five<00:04:28.160> six<00:04:28.580> percent<00:04:29.000> so<00:04:29.360> and<00:04:29.720> then<00:04:30.350> you

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:30.680 
like a five six percent so and then you

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:32.440 
like a five six percent so and then you
know<00:04:30.740> it's<00:04:31.610> a<00:04:31.700> bit<00:04:31.820> stupid<00:04:32.000> because<00:04:32.300> then

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:32.450 
know it's a bit stupid because then

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:33.610 
know it's a bit stupid because then
they're<00:04:32.600> going<00:04:32.720> and<00:04:32.900> making<00:04:33.050> models<00:04:33.470> which

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:33.620 
they're going and making models which

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:35.409 
they're going and making models which
can't<00:04:33.860> get<00:04:34.070> up<00:04:34.190> there

00:04:35.409 --> 00:04:35.419 
can't get up there

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:41.469 
can't get up there
with<00:04:36.220> anything<00:04:37.220> like<00:04:37.789> three<00:04:38.750> coaches<00:04:40.479> say

00:04:41.469 --> 00:04:41.479 
with anything like three coaches say

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:43.029 
with anything like three coaches say

yeah my advice to you is just if you're
gonna<00:04:43.250> buy<00:04:43.430> these<00:04:43.490> kind<00:04:43.820> of<00:04:43.850> locomotives<00:04:44.419> make

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:45.200 
gonna buy these kind of locomotives make

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:46.840 
gonna buy these kind of locomotives make
sure<00:04:45.350> you've<00:04:45.500> got<00:04:45.530> some<00:04:45.979> make<00:04:46.669> sure<00:04:46.760> you've

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:46.850 
sure you've got some make sure you've

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:48.370 
sure you've got some make sure you've
got<00:04:46.880> a<00:04:47.030> loop<00:04:47.300> where<00:04:47.570> they<00:04:47.690> can<00:04:47.870> just<00:04:47.900> run<00:04:48.229> on

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:48.380 
got a loop where they can just run on

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:50.580 
got a loop where they can just run on
the<00:04:48.500> flat<00:04:48.770> I<00:04:48.979> think<00:04:49.160> that's<00:04:49.310> probably<00:04:49.460> best

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:50.590 
the flat I think that's probably best

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:53.379 
the flat I think that's probably best
or<00:04:51.590> you've<00:04:52.070> got<00:04:52.100> such<00:04:52.460> a<00:04:52.490> slight<00:04:52.789> incline<00:04:53.180> that

00:04:53.379 --> 00:04:53.389 
or you've got such a slight incline that

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:54.850 
or you've got such a slight incline that
it<00:04:53.510> doesn't<00:04:53.810> it<00:04:53.930> doesn't<00:04:54.110> matter<00:04:54.380> like<00:04:54.590> less

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:54.860 
it doesn't it doesn't matter like less

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:56.379 
it doesn't it doesn't matter like less
than<00:04:55.039> two<00:04:55.190> percent<00:04:55.310> if<00:04:55.760> if<00:04:56.060> at<00:04:56.210> all<00:04:56.330> possible

00:04:56.379 --> 00:04:56.389 
than two percent if if at all possible
