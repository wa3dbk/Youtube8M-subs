all-stars today we're going to be taking
a<00:00:06.569> look<00:00:06.720> at<00:00:06.899> the<00:00:07.140> Nike<00:00:07.529> Lakota<00:00:08.370> head<00:00:08.760> this<00:00:09.389> is<00:00:09.599> a

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
a look at the Nike Lakota head this is a

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:11.930 
a look at the Nike Lakota head this is a
high<00:00:09.960> school<00:00:10.019> legal<00:00:10.590> head<00:00:10.800> it's<00:00:11.639> been<00:00:11.790> out<00:00:11.910> for

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
high school legal head it's been out for

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.570 
high school legal head it's been out for
a<00:00:12.150> year<00:00:12.690> or<00:00:12.780> two<00:00:12.929> but<00:00:13.080> it's<00:00:13.259> very<00:00:13.590> popular<00:00:14.130> so

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
a year or two but it's very popular so

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.099 
a year or two but it's very popular so
we<00:00:14.610> thought<00:00:14.820> we'd<00:00:14.969> take<00:00:15.120> a<00:00:15.179> look<00:00:15.420> tell<00:00:16.080> you

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
we thought we'd take a look tell you

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:17.660 
we thought we'd take a look tell you
what<00:00:16.199> we<00:00:16.379> thought<00:00:16.560> about<00:00:16.710> it<00:00:16.920> first<00:00:17.430> off

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
what we thought about it first off

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.099 
what we thought about it first off
you're<00:00:17.880> gonna<00:00:17.970> notice<00:00:18.240> the<00:00:18.570> appearance<00:00:18.869> of

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
you're gonna notice the appearance of

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.769 
you're gonna notice the appearance of
the<00:00:19.230> head<00:00:20.449> it's<00:00:21.449> got<00:00:21.630> pretty<00:00:22.230> big<00:00:22.439> cutaways

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:23.779 
the head it's got pretty big cutaways

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:26.960 
the head it's got pretty big cutaways
it's<00:00:24.779> clearly<00:00:25.170> offset<00:00:25.920> so<00:00:26.519> I<00:00:26.550> think<00:00:26.670> this

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
it's clearly offset so I think this

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.089 
it's clearly offset so I think this
makes<00:00:27.210> it<00:00:27.390> pretty<00:00:27.900> attractive<00:00:28.380> to<00:00:28.800> me<00:00:28.890> voice

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
makes it pretty attractive to me voice

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:30.650 
makes it pretty attractive to me voice
comes<00:00:29.640> in<00:00:29.789> a<00:00:29.849> number<00:00:30.000> of<00:00:30.150> different<00:00:30.330> colors

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
equipment I think it's attractive let me

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.340 
equipment I think it's attractive let me
look<00:00:44.160> at<00:00:44.280> stringing<00:00:44.760> you've<00:00:45.360> got<00:00:45.510> a<00:00:45.539> bunch<00:00:46.200> of

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
look at stringing you've got a bunch of

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.049 
look at stringing you've got a bunch of
different<00:00:46.710> holes<00:00:46.860> up<00:00:47.100> along<00:00:47.280> the<00:00:47.460> scoop<00:00:47.760> you

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
different holes up along the scoop you

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.600 
different holes up along the scoop you
have<00:00:48.510> a<00:00:48.570> ton<00:00:48.930> of<00:00:48.960> sidewall<00:00:49.649> holes<00:00:49.860> as<00:00:50.280> you<00:00:50.460> can

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
have a ton of sidewall holes as you can

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.209 
have a ton of sidewall holes as you can
see<00:00:50.789> I<00:00:50.820> use<00:00:51.090> the<00:00:51.329> vast<00:00:51.660> majority<00:00:51.840> of<00:00:52.199> them<00:00:52.440> the

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
see I use the vast majority of them the

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.400 
see I use the vast majority of them the
only<00:00:53.460> knock<00:00:53.789> on<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.149> string<00:00:54.449> is<00:00:55.050> that<00:00:55.260> when

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
only knock on the string is that when

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.459 
only knock on the string is that when
you<00:00:55.500> get<00:00:55.620> to<00:00:55.739> the<00:00:55.860> bottom<00:00:56.070> of<00:00:56.370> the<00:00:56.489> throat

00:00:57.459 --> 00:00:57.469 
you get to the bottom of the throat

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:00.229 
you get to the bottom of the throat
those<00:00:58.469> holes<00:00:58.739> are<00:00:58.859> a<00:00:58.920> little<00:00:59.039> bit<00:00:59.250> small<00:00:59.579> so<00:00:59.820> it

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
those holes are a little bit small so it

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.060 
those holes are a little bit small so it
makes<00:01:00.420> it<00:01:00.539> really<00:01:00.809> tough<00:01:01.170> to<00:01:01.379> get<00:01:01.469> traditional

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
makes it really tough to get traditional

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.740 
makes it really tough to get traditional
mothers<00:01:02.309> today<00:01:02.520> there<00:01:02.820> so<00:01:03.300> you<00:01:03.359> got<00:01:03.480> to<00:01:03.600> knock

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
mothers today there so you got to knock

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.289 
mothers today there so you got to knock
them<00:01:03.930> off<00:01:04.049> half<00:01:04.379> a<00:01:04.500> point<00:01:04.790> 1.5<00:01:05.790> out<00:01:06.000> of<00:01:06.090> tune

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
them off half a point 1.5 out of tune

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.120 
them off half a point 1.5 out of tune
now<00:01:06.900> when<00:01:07.020> you<00:01:07.080> talk<00:01:07.260> about<00:01:07.320> stiffness

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
now when you talk about stiffness

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.670 
now when you talk about stiffness
there's<00:01:08.729> a<00:01:08.790> pretty<00:01:09.030> stiff<00:01:09.330> head<00:01:09.630> it<00:01:10.530> doesn't

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
there's a pretty stiff head it doesn't

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.039 
there's a pretty stiff head it doesn't
have<00:01:10.860> a<00:01:10.920> ton<00:01:11.189> of<00:01:11.220> flex<00:01:11.640> to<00:01:11.909> it<00:01:11.939> you<00:01:12.900> know<00:01:12.990> it

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
have a ton of flex to it you know it

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.289 
have a ton of flex to it you know it
doesn't<00:01:13.260> give<00:01:13.560> one<00:01:13.860> way<00:01:14.070> or<00:01:14.250> the<00:01:14.369> other<00:01:14.400> too

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
doesn't give one way or the other too

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.530 
doesn't give one way or the other too
much<00:01:16.040> it's<00:01:17.040> pretty<00:01:17.130> good<00:01:17.700> and<00:01:18.000> it's<00:01:18.240> not<00:01:18.360> the

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
much it's pretty good and it's not the

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.929 
much it's pretty good and it's not the
stiffest<00:01:19.110> head<00:01:19.320> in<00:01:19.409> the<00:01:19.470> world<00:01:19.680> I<00:01:19.979> don't<00:01:20.729> even

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
stiffest head in the world I don't even

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.730 
stiffest head in the world I don't even
think<00:01:21.060> it's<00:01:21.330> the<00:01:21.540> strongest<00:01:21.810> tender<00:01:22.530> world

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
think it's the strongest tender world

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.950 
think it's the strongest tender world
but<00:01:23.700> it's<00:01:23.850> good<00:01:24.119> it's<00:01:24.330> decent

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
but it's good it's decent

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.960 
but it's good it's decent
it<00:01:25.530> feels<00:01:25.799> pretty<00:01:26.040> solid<00:01:26.310> in<00:01:26.490> their<00:01:26.640> hands<00:01:26.820> is

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
it feels pretty solid in their hands is

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.730 
it feels pretty solid in their hands is
not<00:01:27.000> going<00:01:27.270> to<00:01:27.390> go<00:01:27.509> anywhere<00:01:27.750> so<00:01:28.080> while<00:01:28.530> it's

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
not going to go anywhere so while it's

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.190 
not going to go anywhere so while it's
not<00:01:28.799> a<00:01:28.920> standout<00:01:29.729> in<00:01:29.880> that<00:01:30.000> category<00:01:30.360> one

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
not a standout in that category one

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.289 
not a standout in that category one
point<00:01:31.439> five<00:01:31.680> out<00:01:31.890> of<00:01:31.920> two<00:01:32.159> it's<00:01:32.790> got<00:01:33.000> some<00:01:33.150> good

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
point five out of two it's got some good

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.480 
point five out of two it's got some good
stiffness<00:01:33.869> and<00:01:34.079> and<00:01:34.320> character<00:01:35.040> to<00:01:35.250> the<00:01:35.340> head

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
stiffness and and character to the head

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.340 
stiffness and and character to the head
it's<00:01:36.060> got<00:01:36.210> some<00:01:36.360> good<00:01:36.479> integrity<00:01:37.049> now<00:01:37.140> when<00:01:37.259> it

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
it's got some good integrity now when it

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.490 
it's got some good integrity now when it
comes<00:01:37.409> to<00:01:37.590> durability<00:01:37.939> it's<00:01:38.939> pretty<00:01:39.210> tough

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:39.500 
comes to durability it's pretty tough

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.170 
comes to durability it's pretty tough
I've<00:01:40.500> definitely<00:01:40.740> given<00:01:41.070> it<00:01:41.340> a<00:01:41.460> my<00:01:41.880> fair<00:01:42.150> share

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
I've definitely given it a my fair share

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.679 
I've definitely given it a my fair share
of<00:01:42.450> abuse<00:01:42.990> and<00:01:43.579> it's<00:01:44.579> held<00:01:44.790> up<00:01:44.909> well<00:01:45.180> and<00:01:45.509> tell

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
of abuse and it's held up well and tell

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.780 
of abuse and it's held up well and tell
of<00:01:45.840> well<00:01:46.049> I<00:01:46.259> can't<00:01:46.619> say<00:01:46.770> that<00:01:46.950> it<00:01:47.070> has

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
of well I can't say that it has

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.730 
of well I can't say that it has
one<00:01:48.210> issue<00:01:48.390> with<00:01:48.570> it<00:01:48.840> though<00:01:49.020> is<00:01:49.260> if<00:01:49.440> you<00:01:49.560> take

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
one issue with it though is if you take

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.940 
one issue with it though is if you take
face<00:01:50.040> offs<00:01:50.340> I<00:01:50.880> would<00:01:51.510> not<00:01:51.720> buy<00:01:52.080> this<00:01:52.140> head<00:01:52.470> or

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
face offs I would not buy this head or

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.830 
face offs I would not buy this head or
if<00:01:53.040> you<00:01:53.130> throw<00:01:53.370> a<00:01:53.400> lot<00:01:53.640> of<00:01:53.760> big<00:01:53.940> slap<00:01:54.360> and<00:01:54.630> poke

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
if you throw a lot of big slap and poke

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.990 
if you throw a lot of big slap and poke
checks<00:01:55.170> where<00:01:56.100> you've<00:01:56.250> been<00:01:56.430> the<00:01:56.640> head<00:01:56.760> a<00:01:56.790> lot

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
checks where you've been the head a lot

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.300 
checks where you've been the head a lot
because<00:01:57.210> as<00:01:57.930> the<00:01:58.200> head<00:01:58.350> does<00:01:58.620> start<00:01:58.980> to<00:01:59.010> kind

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
because as the head does start to kind

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.330 
because as the head does start to kind
of<00:01:59.370> bend<00:01:59.690> because<00:02:00.690> of<00:02:00.960> how<00:02:01.170> how<00:02:01.650> stiff<00:02:02.040> it<00:02:02.190> is

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
of bend because of how how stiff it is

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.580 
of bend because of how how stiff it is
it<00:02:03.180> kind<00:02:03.360> of<00:02:03.480> keeps<00:02:03.690> that<00:02:03.990> shape<00:02:04.050> because

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
it kind of keeps that shape because

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.740 
it kind of keeps that shape because
there<00:02:04.770> it<00:02:04.979> doesn't<00:02:05.130> flex<00:02:05.580> back<00:02:05.940> to<00:02:06.600> where

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
there it doesn't flex back to where

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:07.100 
there it doesn't flex back to where
you're<00:02:06.870> going

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
you're going

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.680 
you're going
so<00:02:07.290> durability<00:02:07.830> again<00:02:08.130> it's<00:02:08.850> pretty<00:02:09.060> tough<00:02:09.360> it

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
so durability again it's pretty tough it

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.410 
so durability again it's pretty tough it
can<00:02:09.780> take<00:02:09.960> a<00:02:09.990> beating<00:02:10.229> but<00:02:11.100> because<00:02:12.000> when<00:02:12.330> it

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
can take a beating but because when it

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.960 
can take a beating but because when it
bends<00:02:12.750> it<00:02:13.080> can<00:02:13.290> stay<00:02:13.680> bent<00:02:14.010> and<00:02:14.550> will<00:02:14.700> Bend

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
bends it can stay bent and will Bend

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:16.790 
bends it can stay bent and will Bend
back<00:02:15.240> you<00:02:15.870> got<00:02:16.020> to<00:02:16.140> knock<00:02:16.320> it<00:02:16.470> off<00:02:16.590> in<00:02:16.620> the

point five out of two when we get that

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.590 
point five out of two when we get that
value<00:02:22.050> value<00:02:23.040> is<00:02:23.100> important<00:02:23.580> obviously<00:02:23.790> and

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
value value is important obviously and

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.110 
value value is important obviously and
the<00:02:25.320> Lakota<00:02:25.770> head<00:02:26.010> for<00:02:26.459> a<00:02:26.489> high<00:02:26.700> school<00:02:26.910> head

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
the Lakota head for a high school head

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.010 
the Lakota head for a high school head
is<00:02:27.450> a<00:02:27.510> reasonably<00:02:28.080> priced<00:02:28.350> at<00:02:28.830> around<00:02:29.690> $75<00:02:30.690> in

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
is a reasonably priced at around $75 in

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.470 
is a reasonably priced at around $75 in
most<00:02:31.200> places<00:02:32.000> comparable<00:02:33.000> heads<00:02:33.180> are<00:02:33.390> gonna

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
most places comparable heads are gonna

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.370 
most places comparable heads are gonna
run<00:02:33.750> you<00:02:33.989> between<00:02:34.230> 60<00:02:35.070> and<00:02:35.239> probably<00:02:36.239> $100<00:02:37.080> so

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
run you between 60 and probably $100 so

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.340 
run you between 60 and probably $100 so
it<00:02:37.830> is<00:02:38.010> on<00:02:38.220> the<00:02:38.340> lower<00:02:38.640> end<00:02:39.000> of<00:02:39.420> that<00:02:40.020> range

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
it is on the lower end of that range

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:43.160 
it is on the lower end of that range
when<00:02:41.070> I<00:02:41.100> look<00:02:41.370> back<00:02:41.400> at<00:02:41.790> the<00:02:41.910> issue<00:02:42.030> of<00:02:42.630> the

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
when I look back at the issue of the

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.650 
when I look back at the issue of the
durability<00:02:43.410> and<00:02:43.980> how<00:02:44.459> it<00:02:44.640> can<00:02:44.820> warp<00:02:45.150> and

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
durability and how it can warp and

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:46.729 
durability and how it can warp and
doesn't<00:02:46.050> Bend<00:02:46.200> back

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:46.739 
doesn't Bend back

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:49.100 
doesn't Bend back
that<00:02:47.400> gives<00:02:47.640> me<00:02:47.730> some<00:02:47.820> concern<00:02:48.390> but<00:02:48.660> overall<00:02:48.959> I

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
that gives me some concern but overall I

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:51.560 
that gives me some concern but overall I
think<00:02:49.320> it's<00:02:49.560> a<00:02:49.650> pretty<00:02:49.860> high<00:02:50.130> quality<00:02:50.790> product

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
think it's a pretty high quality product

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:54.800 
think it's a pretty high quality product
and<00:02:52.530> for<00:02:52.799> being<00:02:52.920> 75<00:02:53.519> dollars<00:02:53.910> there's<00:02:54.180> only<00:02:54.330> 15

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
and for being 75 dollars there's only 15

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:57.050 
and for being 75 dollars there's only 15
above<00:02:54.989> kind<00:02:55.440> of<00:02:55.500> that<00:02:55.620> minimum<00:02:56.130> elite<00:02:56.850> level

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
above kind of that minimum elite level

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.870 
above kind of that minimum elite level
threshold<00:02:57.780> pricing<00:02:58.260> point<00:02:58.519> you<00:02:59.519> got<00:02:59.670> to<00:02:59.760> give

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
threshold pricing point you got to give

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.699 
threshold pricing point you got to give
it<00:02:59.910> one<00:03:00.120> point<00:03:00.360> five<00:03:00.630> out<00:03:00.840> of<00:03:00.870> two<00:03:01.080> for<00:03:01.320> value

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
it one point five out of two for value

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:05.090 
it one point five out of two for value
it's<00:03:02.430> a<00:03:02.580> good<00:03:02.820> buy<00:03:03.230> maybe<00:03:04.230> not<00:03:04.440> a<00:03:04.470> great<00:03:04.860> buy

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.100 
it's a good buy maybe not a great buy

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:08.420 
it's a good buy maybe not a great buy
but<00:03:05.459> it's<00:03:05.610> a<00:03:05.730> it's<00:03:05.910> a<00:03:06.209> very<00:03:06.239> good<00:03:06.780> buy<00:03:07.430> people

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
but it's a it's a very good buy people

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.060 
but it's a it's a very good buy people
will<00:03:08.549> see<00:03:08.700> you<00:03:08.850> know<00:03:09.000> clearly<00:03:09.299> it's<00:03:09.570> got<00:03:09.780> that

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:10.070 
will see you know clearly it's got that

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:13.759 
will see you know clearly it's got that
further<00:03:11.070> down<00:03:11.430> the<00:03:11.820> offset<00:03:12.420> it's<00:03:13.290> really<00:03:13.590> good

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:13.769 
further down the offset it's really good

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:16.640 
further down the offset it's really good
for<00:03:13.950> a<00:03:14.010> high<00:03:14.190> pocket<00:03:14.730> it's<00:03:15.269> pretty<00:03:15.570> narrow<00:03:15.810> the

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
for a high pocket it's pretty narrow the

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:18.440 
for a high pocket it's pretty narrow the
way<00:03:16.769> I<00:03:16.799> strain<00:03:17.190> I<00:03:17.340> like<00:03:17.670> kind<00:03:17.880> of<00:03:17.910> a<00:03:18.030> more<00:03:18.269> of<00:03:18.299> a

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
way I strain I like kind of a more of a

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.630 
way I strain I like kind of a more of a
mid-level<00:03:18.989> pocket<00:03:19.470> and<00:03:19.950> where<00:03:20.070> the<00:03:20.190> ball<00:03:20.370> sits

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 
mid-level pocket and where the ball sits

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:23.990 
mid-level pocket and where the ball sits
here<00:03:21.890> it's<00:03:22.890> really<00:03:23.310> in<00:03:23.400> a<00:03:23.489> very<00:03:23.519> narrow

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
here it's really in a very narrow

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.810 
here it's really in a very narrow
portion<00:03:24.330> of<00:03:24.570> the<00:03:24.720> throat<00:03:24.989> so<00:03:25.310> overall<00:03:26.310> I<00:03:26.459> like

portion of the throat so overall I like

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:28.460 
portion of the throat so overall I like
it<00:03:27.000> I've<00:03:27.180> been<00:03:27.330> using<00:03:27.600> it<00:03:27.810> I<00:03:27.900> don't<00:03:28.080> have<00:03:28.230> any
