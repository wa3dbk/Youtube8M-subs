00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:48.630 
can see the possibility of the terrain

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:51.230 
can see the possibility of the terrain
so<00:05:48.930> for<00:05:49.680> instance<00:05:50.100> these<00:05:50.640> rocks<00:05:50.910> over<00:05:51.210> here

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:51.240 
so for instance these rocks over here

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:53.690 
so for instance these rocks over here
are<00:05:51.690> not<00:05:51.900> possible<00:05:52.470> but<00:05:52.650> for<00:05:52.770> land<00:05:53.160> units<00:05:53.550> but
