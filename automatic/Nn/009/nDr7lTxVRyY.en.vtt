00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.950
 hi to all and welcome to the 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:07.200
 presentation of this maxim us6 embarrassed 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.179
 which is the new motherboard asus 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.790
 in z 87 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:16.350
 so it's a micro-atx it's a map 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:18.570
 mother rather range around the 200 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:21.330
 euros anyway so we're on the 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.220
 nice product so a packaging 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.560
 classics as usual at asus 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.630
 rather upscale with the detail of 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.610
 what we have in the x trem nginn on 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:33.030
 will explain her in the 

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:34.650
 on the website the supremefx which is a 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.600
 features of the top cards of 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:40.170
 like asus range with more detail 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:42.180
 far the mini pci-express combo 2 which is 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.060
 such a nice component we will see 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.739
 in detail about the case like 

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:49.860
 usually on halal poultry the 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:52.500
 cardboard was taken up in detail 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:56.750
 main advantages of the mini motherboard 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.750
 pci-express combo 2 extreme jeans 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:04.559
 scalability celi crossfire that's then 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:09.000
 we have the rear view of the panel view 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:10.229
 back with all the connectivity more 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.369
 all the technical details for those 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.840
 who would not be what they bought 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:16.490
 that is, it's a map 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:19.619
 mother for processions 50 etc etc 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:23.130
 So here we open the gold case where 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:25.259
 half of the map we end up on 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.270
 a highlight rather nice 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:30.179
 with a plastic cover we immediately 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:33.170
 the visibility on the motherboard is 

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:36.899
 Flattering is very flattering 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:42.530
 so we will remove the map and see already 

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:42.530
 what he was delivering with this motherboard 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:58.180
 so we have the shield obviously we have 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:02:01.590
 the equivalent we have six cables sata iii on 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:05.260
 has small connectivity the module 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:06.970
 mini pci-express combo what it takes 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:11.350
 obviously for the crossfire the series has 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:12.850
 assigned driver leaflet stickers if 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:16.300
 you want to make a clean montage 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:18.100
 So here is the motherboard pcb wind 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:20.100
 it's really great class I see 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:22.450
 high-end capacitors 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:25.890
 we really see a quality finish 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:28.300
 who is still more than friendly 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:32.430
 these are the high-end capacitors 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:32.430
 the lcd display for error eco 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:39.470
 boring the eight sata connectors 3 

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:42.680
 since it's one of the big ones 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:45.640
 town in front of the z 97 87 8 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.640
 sata iii connectors 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:49.920
 the buttons to see the recipes button 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:55.920
 those who have their hands in the box 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:59.610
 permanently and who tinker we have four 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:01.650
 supports ddr3 4 supports they are 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:04.650
 able to accept 8 giga modules 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:07.230
 so 32 gigas in total on a map 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.670
 mother like that it's pretty nice there we have 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:12.270
 something interesting is the 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:15.380
 supreme module fx which is a 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:16.920
 particularity of asus we will see that in the 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:19.110
 web test 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:24.060
 and then here I let you watch the 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:24.960
 pcb quality mounting quality 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:27.690
 of this motherboard 

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:30.110
 you get what you pay for there is not there 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:34.590
 There is no need to say we are still pretty 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:36.459
 pretty neat here so see all 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:38.370
 capacitors see 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:43.200
 everything that is 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:46.200
 rm components that we will see everything from 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:54.900
 after they have careened a good 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:59.700
 heard behind we have six USB 3 usb 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:04:03.810
 classic a port hdmi an output 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:05.030
 optical a 5.1 sound network port and 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:09.700
 laleu 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:14.240
 the mini pci combo 2 receptacle 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:16.220
 of course you see both 

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:18.980
 16x express PCI ports and here is the famous 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:20.440
 mini pci-express congo two module 

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:22.669
 so it's pretty original 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:26.540
 it's a small module that will help you 

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:29.450
 give an esata port of the usb2 and 

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:31.580
 others and so to combo port that allows 

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:34.639
 to connect for example a wi fi module 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:37.490
 a bluetooth module to give still 

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:39.620
 of the usb 2 and why not satin in 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:41.810
 on the on the connector some 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:44.330
 we saw so it's nice it's not 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:45.980
 mandatory but it avoids 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:48.370
 to have on a micro tea xx card which 

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:52.760
 still by definition rather small 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:56.620
 an extension without having cables that 

00:04:52.760 --> 00:05:00.229
 strolls useless stuff 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:01.669
 that's where it goes to this village is 

00:05:00.229 --> 00:05:04.250
 not slipped but it is done quickly for 

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:07.000
 to be supportive of the motherboard of the 

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:07.000
 small visit on time 

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:18.600
 so we're going to look at the socket one that 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:21.120
 looks suspiciously like socket 11 55 

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:23.250
 so we have exactly the same system of 

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:25.860
 fixing the same opening system on 

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:29.820
 is supposed to have 5 pinoges less 

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:31.650
 will not check it's very very close 

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:33.240
 and very similar it's so 

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:35.699
 similar that it's 

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:36.960
 the same in fact it is almost the past 

00:05:35.699 --> 00:05:38.789
 the same points of attachment since 

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:42.449
 here I have a socket a fan on 

00:05:38.789 --> 00:05:45.330
 204 have 55 and it works perfectly 

00:05:42.449 --> 00:05:48.690
 it comes clipping it's the same 

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:50.430
 across points is the surface of 

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:51.180
 plate cooling exactly at 

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:53.639
 same place 

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:54.210
 so for those who want to change 

00:05:53.639 --> 00:05:55.410
 platform 

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:57.990
 they will not have lost everything to 

00:05:55.410 --> 00:06:00.720
 recover their 26 lots or their kit 

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:04.220
 watercooling we 'll try that's why 

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:04.220
 taken we're going to say so here's
