00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:21.960
 hi here doing repairs today 

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:25.910
 car kamaz engine happened 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:30.960
 such a breakdown nasty drip antifreeze 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:34.350
 here is antifreeze flowed out of the heads here 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:42.180
 whether that drip out of this nozzle 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:43.100
 he cracked or gasket just burnt 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:48.800
 snowstorms 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:53.760
 Well shorter antifreeze drip thats all 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:55.399
 us flows through the camber and sat on 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:01:01.010
 lands 

00:00:55.399 --> 00:01:04.699
 we will shoot now 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:07.210
 air collector is now on the other 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:10.270
 the sides are both him there will be better seen 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:11.540
 Here I started to have problems by the way 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:14.869
 neat 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:19.700
 antifreeze flowing here it is from under the heads 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:21.890
 but it will be clear from here 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:27.890
 from under the heads flowed not from under 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:31.450
 pipes so well for us to get to 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:33.140
 this pipe here I started to disassemble 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:39.920
 we need to take off 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:42.880
 return pipe hose and tubing with 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:48.380
 fuel pump 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:52.940
 the tank can not remove we will not hurt 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:56.750
 unleash immediately here on the bolts here 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:02:06.470
 this air here it is air 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:10.090
 the collector and the pump we will not need 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:16.540
 shoot here but I'll still shoot gur 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:21.410
 here too the tank flows too we will replace it 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:23.860
 well, until I solve the problem with antifreeze take off 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:23.860
 this one 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:37.930
 here is the air collector here 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:39.879
 further we will understand so but now 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:44.049
 when I take off nothing here principle 

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:46.480
 interesting is twisting the nuts and then 

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:49.359
 let's see what happened to me 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:50.200
 collector can he cracked can 

00:02:49.359 --> 00:02:55.930
 gaskets 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:58.650
 like this 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:03.209
 our pipe 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:05.700
 here we have it 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:09.180
 we flowed antifreeze 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:09.180
 from here 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:15.910
 Here, but I think most likely to do it 

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:26.090
 not in the pipe 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:32.420
 The point in this head will need to be a picture 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:34.840
 head and most likely there are barrels 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:34.840
 three kegs 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:47.470
 It happened here and so I think this thing is not 

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:52.880
 in the laying the gasket is whole and here's a 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:59.380
 deal with me talk so here i am now 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:04:04.760
 take off 4 bolts and see what we have there 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:09.560
 happened why we drove antifreeze 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:13.210
 from under I thought and the collector decline 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:13.210
 turn out from under the head 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:25.780
 so I removed the head 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:31.850
 that's how I thought it was laying 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:40.450
 here and how to eat your anger 

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:40.450
 for this reason, antifreeze tech with preparation 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:53.120
 the head itself now flowed out of here and all 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:57.710
 Now we will put new gaskets all 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:05:00.400
 on sealant and tomorrow we will try 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:00.400
 start up 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:14.490
 Now here is a repair I and tomorrow 

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:19.199
 check here for today 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:20.849
 Now I clean myself will put on sealant and 

00:05:19.199 --> 00:05:27.789
 everything 

00:05:20.849 --> 00:05:31.210
 I'll screw it up and tomorrow we'll just fill in the ambassador and I 

00:05:27.789 --> 00:05:36.030
 I think everything will be fine as well, all over the 

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:36.030
 Thank you all for your attention.
