00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
beginning of having pinterest it would

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.539 
beginning of having pinterest it would
have<00:02:02.700> been<00:02:02.759> just<00:02:03.149> amazing<00:02:04.189> now<00:02:05.189> you<00:02:05.250> see<00:02:05.520> that

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
have been just amazing now you see that

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.880 
have been just amazing now you see that
it<00:02:05.759> will<00:02:05.850> go<00:02:06.030> through<00:02:06.469> sometimes<00:02:07.469> it<00:02:07.799> goes

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
it will go through sometimes it goes

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.809 
it will go through sometimes it goes
through<00:02:08.190> quite<00:02:08.550> a<00:02:08.610> bit

00:02:09.809 --> 00:02:09.819 
through quite a bit

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:12.630 
through quite a bit
of<00:02:09.929> flickr<00:02:10.929> so<00:02:11.409> sometimes<00:02:11.799> it<00:02:12.189> might<00:02:12.340> take<00:02:12.609> a

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
of flickr so sometimes it might take a

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.569 
of flickr so sometimes it might take a
little<00:02:12.790> while<00:02:12.939> and<00:02:13.359> plus<00:02:14.430> obviously<00:02:15.430> i<00:02:15.459> know

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:15.579 
little while and plus obviously i know

00:02:15.579 --> 00:02:16.860 
little while and plus obviously i know
it<00:02:15.790> might<00:02:15.909> be<00:02:15.939> running<00:02:16.150> a<00:02:16.389> little<00:02:16.540> slower

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
it might be running a little slower

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:19.580 
it might be running a little slower
since<00:02:17.379> i<00:02:17.560> actually<00:02:17.889> have<00:02:18.069> the<00:02:18.760> video<00:02:19.030> running

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
since i actually have the video running

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.559 
since i actually have the video running
but<00:02:20.590> it<00:02:20.709> should<00:02:20.980> be<00:02:21.010> just<00:02:21.129> another<00:02:21.939> second<00:02:22.480> or

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:22.569 
but it should be just another second or

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:25.170 
but it should be just another second or
so<00:02:22.870> and<00:02:23.499> like<00:02:24.310> i<00:02:24.370> said<00:02:24.579> i<00:02:24.639> mean<00:02:24.819> i've<00:02:25.030> been
