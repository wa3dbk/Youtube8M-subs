their<00:00:39.109> foundations<00:00:39.739> our<00:00:40.309> yellow<00:00:41.090> based<00:00:43.390> with

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:44.390 
their foundations our yellow based with

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:47.770 
their foundations our yellow based with
african-american<00:00:45.260> women<00:00:45.620> a<00:00:46.149> lot<00:00:47.149> of<00:00:47.329> cosmetic

00:00:51.099 --> 00:00:51.109 
companies do not cater to us and so the

00:00:51.109 --> 00:00:54.759 
companies do not cater to us and so the
undertones<00:00:51.710> will<00:00:52.250> have<00:00:52.550> like<00:00:52.850> Don<00:00:53.120> and<00:00:53.769> Ashley

00:00:58.930 --> 00:00:58.940 
or pink base to them and it's really

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:02.139

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:05.800 
hard to know which lines have those
undertones<00:01:03.430> so<00:01:04.430> I<00:01:04.760> was<00:01:04.940> really<00:01:05.089> happy<00:01:05.449> when<00:01:05.750> I
