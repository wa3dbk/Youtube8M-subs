00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
wrong with the ignition system they

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.819 
wrong with the ignition system they
where<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:47.820> voltage<00:00:47.969> drop<00:00:48.450> is<00:00:48.660> your<00:00:49.350> test<00:00:49.590> like

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829

no started to see what's going on oh
it's<00:00:58.829> on<00:00:58.980> every<00:00:59.699> 13<00:01:00.379> like<00:01:01.379> you<00:01:01.920> can't<00:01:02.160> see<00:01:02.370> it

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460

it's on every 13 like you can't see it
on<00:01:02.579> the<00:01:02.730> camera<00:01:02.940> I<00:01:03.559> can't<00:01:04.559> just

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:16.250 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:20.959 

 batteries<00:01:17.729> right<00:01:18.000> now<00:01:19.549> but<00:01:20.549> yeah<00:01:20.700> you

00:01:20.959 --> 00:01:20.969 
 batteries right now but yeah you

00:01:20.969 --> 00:01:24.440 
 batteries right now but yeah you
can<00:01:21.119> say<00:01:21.360> this<00:01:22.460> something<00:01:23.460> odd<00:01:23.700> was<00:01:23.939> going<00:01:24.240> on

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
can say this something odd was going on

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:32.029 
can say this something odd was going on
hey<00:01:24.570> everything<00:01:24.960> all<00:01:29.149> right<00:01:30.149> check<00:01:30.539> -<00:01:30.979> now<00:01:31.979> for

00:01:32.029 --> 00:01:32.039 
hey everything all right check - now for

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:34.999 
hey everything all right check - now for
another<00:01:32.280> Coriolanus<00:01:33.060> is<00:01:33.299> what<00:01:33.479> I<00:01:33.509> think<00:01:34.009> that

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
another Coriolanus is what I think that

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.039 
another Coriolanus is what I think that
other<00:01:35.250> coil<00:01:35.729> was<00:01:35.880> overloading<00:01:36.509> miss<00:01:36.659> powers

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
other coil was overloading miss powers

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.260 
other coil was overloading miss powers
down<00:01:37.289> here<00:01:37.679> and<00:01:38.250> not<00:01:38.460> getting<00:01:38.640> enough<00:01:38.759> voltage

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
down here and not getting enough voltage

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.100 
down here and not getting enough voltage
that's<00:01:39.569> what<00:01:39.720> light<00:01:40.159> didn't<00:01:41.159> wider<00:01:41.810> one<00:01:42.810> coil

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
that's what light didn't wider one coil

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:49.339 
that's what light didn't wider one coil
so<00:01:43.409> put<00:01:43.649> one<00:01:43.679> off<00:01:43.950> the<00:01:44.130> old<00:01:44.250> Mercedes<00:01:44.399> on<00:01:48.110> well

00:01:49.339 --> 00:01:49.349 
so put one off the old Mercedes on well

00:01:49.349 --> 00:02:16.309 
so put one off the old Mercedes on well
why<00:01:49.560> so<00:01:49.770> what<00:01:49.890> brought<00:01:50.130> in<00:01:50.280> there

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:26.830 

Coria

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.870 

happening<00:02:27.530> here<00:02:27.590> the<00:02:28.099> aircon<00:02:28.640> whoo

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:28.880 
happening here the aircon whoo

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:34.309 
happening here the aircon whoo
headlights<00:02:29.480> on

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:34.319 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:03:29.059 

okay<00:02:34.560> with<00:02:34.709> that

00:03:29.059 --> 00:03:29.069 

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:32.040 

there<00:03:30.069> in<00:03:30.190> conclusion<00:03:30.610> you<00:03:31.090> had<00:03:31.480> a<00:03:31.510> 12<00:03:31.840> volt

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:32.050 
there in conclusion you had a 12 volt

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:34.050 
there in conclusion you had a 12 volt
coil<00:03:32.319> on<00:03:32.590> it<00:03:32.739> instead<00:03:33.159> of<00:03:33.220> a<00:03:33.340> coil<00:03:33.700> it<00:03:33.790> needed

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.060 
coil on it instead of a coil it needed

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:35.399 
coil on it instead of a coil it needed
to<00:03:34.090> be<00:03:34.150> running<00:03:34.510> to<00:03:34.569> this<00:03:34.690> ballast<00:03:35.230> resistor

00:03:35.399 --> 00:03:35.409 
to be running to this ballast resistor

00:03:35.409 --> 00:03:39.390 
to be running to this ballast resistor
which<00:03:36.370> that<00:03:36.640> is<00:03:36.989> when<00:03:37.989> the<00:03:38.200> engines<00:03:38.620> cold<00:03:39.040> and

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:39.400 
which that is when the engines cold and

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:40.289 
which that is when the engines cold and
just<00:03:39.430> started<00:03:40.000> it

00:03:40.289 --> 00:03:40.299 
just started it

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:42.600 
just started it
the<00:03:40.629> battery<00:03:40.989> was<00:03:41.110> a<00:03:41.170> bit<00:03:41.349> flat<00:03:41.680> so<00:03:42.040> that

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:42.610 
the battery was a bit flat so that

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:44.399 
the battery was a bit flat so that
wasn't<00:03:42.940> getting<00:03:43.120> 12<00:03:43.510> volts<00:03:43.750> start<00:03:44.170> we're

00:03:44.399 --> 00:03:44.409 
wasn't getting 12 volts start we're

00:03:44.409 --> 00:03:47.339 
wasn't getting 12 volts start we're
giving<00:03:45.069> the<00:03:45.190> coil<00:03:45.519> six<00:03:45.819> volts<00:03:46.180> which<00:03:47.110> was

00:03:47.339 --> 00:03:47.349 
giving the coil six volts which was

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:51.360 
giving the coil six volts which was
enough<00:03:47.650> to<00:03:47.799> run<00:03:47.890> a<00:03:47.920> 12<00:03:48.280> volt<00:03:48.489> coil<00:03:50.040> yeah<00:03:51.040> that's

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:51.370 
enough to run a 12 volt coil yeah that's

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:53.280 
enough to run a 12 volt coil yeah that's
probably<00:03:51.849> most<00:03:52.120> shut<00:03:52.510> up<00:03:52.720> and<00:03:52.930> then<00:03:53.019> the<00:03:53.080> Cavs

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:53.290 
probably most shut up and then the Cavs

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:58.319 
probably most shut up and then the Cavs
Co<00:03:55.319> now<00:03:56.319> I've<00:03:56.440> got<00:03:56.590> a<00:03:56.620> coil<00:03:56.950> miss<00:03:57.790> Bella<00:03:58.030> she's

00:03:58.319 --> 00:03:58.329 
Co now I've got a coil miss Bella she's

00:03:58.329 --> 00:04:00.839 
Co now I've got a coil miss Bella she's
done<00:03:58.659> well<00:03:58.870> for<00:03:59.140> one<00:03:59.349> and<00:03:59.950> soy<00:04:00.459> some<00:04:00.640> quite

00:04:00.839 --> 00:04:00.849 
done well for one and soy some quite

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:05.849 
done well for one and soy some quite
nice<00:04:01.060> now<00:04:02.519> one<00:04:03.519> to<00:04:03.640> the<00:04:03.700> right
