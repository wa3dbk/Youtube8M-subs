00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 Welcome to my business channel and today 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:06.779
 let's make the real base or also 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.639
 called own base if this is 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.710
 Use a lot to decorate to eat 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.809
 especially the cupcakes or also the 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.630
 eggs below we can also do with 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.699
 these flowers or different decorations 

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:20.010
 it's very simple to do and you can 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.840
 dye with different colors let's start 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:25.439
 with the programming for this link 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:28.680
 real what we need is 250 sugar 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:30.619
 impalpable works two egg whites and 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:34.969
 a teaspoon of lemon juice 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:34.969
 we start by placing the egg whites 

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:43.560
 once we have the egg whites 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:43.560
 we started to beat 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:03.030
 once the egg whites start to 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.860
 play we start to put sugar already 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:08.090
 As we are putting we continue 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.090
 beating little by little 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:45.840
 and finally add the teaspoon of 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.840
 lemon juice 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:01.590
 Here we can see that it is already hard in the 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:04.619
 thirst but as we realize when 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:07.470
 it's because it stays firmer and 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:09.509
 because when he touches him he does not stick 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:12.710
 in this case we can see that it impacts 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:16.760
 a little more then we keep adding 

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:20.340
 little by little we can go with a spoon 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:23.090
 adding impalpable sugar to achieve 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.090
 the exact point 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:32.290
 ah 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:38.660
 Let's see 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:48.890
 as I told you previously he decided 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:52.340
 in placing the impalpable sugar until 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:53.959
 reach the desired point I gave him the 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.600
 amounts so they have an idea 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:58.760
 approximate other way I would throw more 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:02.890
 impalpable sugar until you get to this 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:07.470
 point that as you see is very firm 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:07.470
 and when you touch it you can not see 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:14.140
 this we can place it in the sleeves 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:18.430
 cake hours 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:22.120
 we can put dyes to be able 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:25.180
 Decorate Easter eggs cookies or 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:27.909
 use it also to decorate cupcakes 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:31.200
 I hope you liked this idea and 

00:03:27.909 --> 00:03:31.200
 that comes out exquisite 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:40.690
 for more
