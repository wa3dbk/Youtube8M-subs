if I have a pretty good bat with the
Bosch<00:03:02.359> or<00:03:03.019> the<00:03:03.140> pure<00:03:03.409> later<00:03:03.680> pure<00:03:03.950> one<00:03:04.249> these

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:04.579 
Bosch or the pure later pure one these

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:06.550 
Bosch or the pure later pure one these
weren't<00:03:04.909> too<00:03:05.090> bad<00:03:05.299> these<00:03:05.870> aren't<00:03:06.079> bad<00:03:06.260> at<00:03:06.319> all

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:06.560 
weren't too bad these aren't bad at all

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:08.410 
weren't too bad these aren't bad at all
if<00:03:06.739> you<00:03:06.859> could<00:03:07.010> give<00:03:07.249> me<00:03:07.310> goodbye<00:03:07.489> if<00:03:08.090> you<00:03:08.269> want

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:08.420 
if you could give me goodbye if you want

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:09.759 
if you could give me goodbye if you want
to<00:03:08.480> buy<00:03:08.599> a<00:03:08.629> filter<00:03:08.959> off<00:03:09.200> the<00:03:09.319> shelf<00:03:09.560> you<00:03:09.650> can

00:03:09.759 --> 00:03:09.769 
to buy a filter off the shelf you can

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:11.830 
to buy a filter off the shelf you can
buy<00:03:09.950> one<00:03:10.159> of<00:03:10.189> these<00:03:10.400> and<00:03:11.239> you'd<00:03:11.420> probably<00:03:11.629> do

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 
buy one of these and you'd probably do

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.920 
buy one of these and you'd probably do
okay<00:03:11.870> and<00:03:12.909> of<00:03:13.909> course<00:03:14.180> the<00:03:14.389> best<00:03:14.629> was<00:03:14.900> the

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:14.930 
okay and of course the best was the

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:16.869 
okay and of course the best was the
fleet<00:03:15.290> guard<00:03:15.590> and<00:03:15.980> I<00:03:16.069> think<00:03:16.310> this<00:03:16.459> is<00:03:16.579> a<00:03:16.609> mail

00:03:16.869 --> 00:03:16.879 
fleet guard and I think this is a mail

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:19.629 
fleet guard and I think this is a mail
order<00:03:16.909> filter<00:03:17.629> only<00:03:18.069> and<00:03:19.069> you<00:03:19.189> can<00:03:19.310> only<00:03:19.430> buy

00:03:19.629 --> 00:03:19.639 
order filter only and you can only buy

00:03:19.639 --> 00:03:22.089 
order filter only and you can only buy
it<00:03:19.670> by<00:03:19.939> the<00:03:20.000> case<00:03:20.299> but<00:03:20.659> by<00:03:20.900> far<00:03:21.319> this<00:03:21.859> is<00:03:22.069> the

00:03:22.089 --> 00:03:22.099 
it by the case but by far this is the

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:25.229 
it by the case but by far this is the
best<00:03:22.219> filter<00:03:22.879> because<00:03:23.689> of<00:03:23.840> the<00:03:23.900> filter<00:03:24.290> media

00:03:25.229 --> 00:03:25.239 
best filter because of the filter media

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:28.179 
best filter because of the filter media
and<00:03:26.239> that's<00:03:26.389> that's<00:03:26.750> just<00:03:26.840> the<00:03:27.169> best<00:03:27.379> the<00:03:28.040> best

00:03:28.179 --> 00:03:28.189 
and that's that's just the best the best

00:03:28.189 --> 00:03:31.150 
and that's that's just the best the best
filter<00:03:28.700> that<00:03:29.569> I've<00:03:29.719> seen<00:03:29.930> out<00:03:30.109> of<00:03:30.200> all<00:03:30.349> these

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:31.160
