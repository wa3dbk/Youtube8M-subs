00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:20.730
 hello to everyone from dennis here with this 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.539
 new video this time is not a 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:28.230
 gameplay or other is just with like 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:31.800
 configure a gaming PC with a 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:34.380
 maximum of 500 euros 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.940
 here is this which is very similar to mine 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:41.100
 gaming pc 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:43.760
 we are on the site and we see a little 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.410
 pieces are then we start from 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:50.550
 from the power supply as a power supply ho 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:56.039
 used a 500 watt master cooler is 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:57.840
 very good and with 500 watts it is ideal 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.090
 to hold all other components 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:03.090
 this computer 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:08.750
 now let's move on to the keys which if 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:10.610
 always used an elite master cooler from 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:13.340
 large enough that it can hold 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:17.080
 all that I have chosen for this 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:22.540
 very good computer 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:28.160
 as you can see also pretty nice from 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:29.180
 let's move on we move on to the bayern 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:34.369
 motherboard 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:39.860
 the screen I chose an asus m5 a 78 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:43.430
 mm with usb 3 ports is an excellent card 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:46.840
 mother that can hold up to 16 gb of 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:52.780
 memory that is ram over body 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:02:01.300
 therefore overclockable 202,000 hearts 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:02:06.340
 good good motherboard and then 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:12.680
 quite then a hdmi port to 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:16.340
 various audio ports and two USB 3.0 ports 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:19.880
 and 4 usb 2.0 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:23.269
 higher is here internal but this is what 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:26.170
 those that matter are fine this is 

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:29.530
 a good board that I badly recommend for 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:35.360
 this computer 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:38.900
 let's move on to the motherboard now 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:43.330
 all hard disk over the hard disk whatever 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:45.530
 from 500 hp can be fine 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:49.730
 now let's move on to the processor at 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:54.920
 processor I chose a 6,206 corapi fx 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:03:01.940
 sera 3.5 g third overclockable up to 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:06.050
 at 4,000 104.1 jeeps a very good one 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:09.890
 processor that consumes even a little less 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:13.760
 of that other that I am at its own 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:19.300
 brought we say as it is much less than a 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:26.200
 phenomenon which does not offer but less than one 

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:32.330
 fx 4100 type is an excellent processor that 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:34.730
 allows a good cepu admits to do 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:38.360
 travel to all well on all games 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:41.780
 make the games go well then for me 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:47.600
 is fine then now we move on to 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:51.060
 ram amoretto a house a race for the gagers 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:55.420
 blue after film 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:57.730
 for 8 lap which is fine though 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:00.130
 I will mark even less and if you want 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:02.590
 could take even less 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:05.140
 now let's move on to the vito la card 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:12.640
 video card chosen a shopping lie 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:14.050
 ati amd 7,770 naples hicks from known but 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:19.900
 video card from 

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:24.010
 even just from a great to an hdmi port 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:31.240
 and also the support of how you see here 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:35.050
 oh well okay you go to a thousand and 100 mega hertz 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:41.880
 good floor clock I make you 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:46.980
 see also what more bosses say about it today 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:51.970
 what site where I look at the statistics 

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:55.660
 of the cards of the mother video cards 

00:04:51.970 --> 00:05:00.010
 there is also the processors is somewhat act 

00:04:55.660 --> 00:05:02.670
 and see then sharpen we occupy the 

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:02.670
 directly 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:08.750
 here it is 

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:24.199
 runs to cartier 

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:27.499
 77 and 90 here it is more or less 

00:05:24.199 --> 00:05:30.800
 this guys here no to me this 

00:05:27.499 --> 00:05:35.679
 slice boys wait for this choice 90 

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:35.679
 and I had 770 here it is 

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:41.940
 here it is now if internet hired yes 

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:45.280
 more or less is this here though 

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:52.150
 honestly this is much more powerful 

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:54.310
 because we see this either way 

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:57.100
 quite good but it's not that it isn't 

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:59.340
 this is not what this is here 

00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:02.170
 different and more powerful 

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:09.270
 this is a little less powerful is the 

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:11.980
 version from a little more version 

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:15.280
 old and in any case this is much better 

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:16.440
 and to the very reliable guys that there 

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:19.720
 I highly recommend it 

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:25.450
 and also for this video on 

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:27.640
 amd configuration from 500 euros is everything 

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:30.130
 See you at the next child forever 

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:33.040
 but on the confederation amd this 

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:36.160
 time on the 800 euros 

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:36.550
 we'll see how to have a very good baby 

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:38.140
 game 

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:40.870
 and remember with this configuration 

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:45.520
 here you can run well enough 

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:49.180
 all these games here you see on 

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:54.190
