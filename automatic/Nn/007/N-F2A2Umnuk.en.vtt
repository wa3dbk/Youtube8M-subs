tutorial now today I'm going to show you
this<00:00:07.379> Rubik's<00:00:08.069> Cube<00:00:08.400> effect<00:00:08.790> in<00:00:09.030> cinema<00:00:09.660> 4d

00:00:10.839 --> 00:00:10.849 
this Rubik's Cube effect in cinema 4d

00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:13.879 
this Rubik's Cube effect in cinema 4d
now<00:00:11.849> before<00:00:12.360> we<00:00:12.420> get<00:00:12.509> started<00:00:12.719> it's<00:00:13.500> not

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
now before we get started it's not

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.370 
now before we get started it's not
exactly<00:00:14.089> very<00:00:15.089> complex<00:00:15.780> in<00:00:16.139> its<00:00:16.379> shape<00:00:16.830> a

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:18.380 
exactly very complex in its shape a

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:21.260 
exactly very complex in its shape a
purely<00:00:19.380> due<00:00:19.680> to<00:00:19.800> the<00:00:19.949> fact<00:00:20.220> that<00:00:20.430> as<00:00:20.850> you<00:00:21.029> see

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
purely due to the fact that as you see

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.340 
purely due to the fact that as you see
here<00:00:21.689> or<00:00:22.650> go<00:00:23.340> to<00:00:23.400> get<00:00:23.580> away<00:00:23.699> where<00:00:23.970> the<00:00:24.060> lights

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:24.350 
here or go to get away where the lights

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:28.519 
here or go to get away where the lights
more<00:00:25.350> bright<00:00:26.090> go<00:00:27.090> to<00:00:27.150> the<00:00:27.300> top<00:00:27.510> actually<00:00:27.930> as

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
more bright go to the top actually as

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.220 
more bright go to the top actually as
you<00:00:29.039> see<00:00:29.220> here<00:00:29.460> it's<00:00:29.670> green<00:00:30.000> and<00:00:30.029> green<00:00:30.539> rose

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
you see here it's green and green rose

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.790 
you see here it's green and green rose
on<00:00:31.380> an<00:00:31.470> actual<00:00:31.679> Rubik's<00:00:32.399> Cube<00:00:33.770> there'll<00:00:34.770> be

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
on an actual Rubik's Cube there'll be

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.069 
on an actual Rubik's Cube there'll be
different<00:00:35.280> colors<00:00:35.640> will<00:00:35.910> be<00:00:36.030> a<00:00:36.390> big<00:00:36.750> square

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
different colors will be a big square

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:38.720 
different colors will be a big square
that's<00:00:37.320> the<00:00:37.469> actual<00:00:37.590> thing<00:00:38.129> and<00:00:38.309> then<00:00:38.520> there

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
that's the actual thing and then there

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.459 
that's the actual thing and then there
will<00:00:38.820> be<00:00:39.379> different<00:00:40.379> three<00:00:41.100> rows<00:00:41.280> of<00:00:41.489> three

00:00:42.459 --> 00:00:42.469 
will be different three rows of three

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:45.110 
will be different three rows of three
separate<00:00:43.469> squares<00:00:43.829> and<00:00:44.070> on<00:00:44.190> them<00:00:44.399> there<00:00:45.030> will

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
separate squares and on them there will

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.930 
separate squares and on them there will
be<00:00:45.149> a<00:00:45.210> different<00:00:45.539> color<00:00:46.219> now<00:00:47.219> that's<00:00:47.670> a<00:00:47.820> bit

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
be a different color now that's a bit

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.720 
be a different color now that's a bit
too<00:00:47.969> advanced<00:00:48.420> for<00:00:48.570> this<00:00:48.750> tutorial<00:00:49.640> so<00:00:50.640> I'm

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
too advanced for this tutorial so I'm

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.459 
too advanced for this tutorial so I'm
just<00:00:50.820> going<00:00:50.940> to<00:00:51.000> show<00:00:51.120> you<00:00:51.180> a<00:00:51.270> basic<00:00:51.539> one<00:00:52.170> now

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
just going to show you a basic one now

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.790 
just going to show you a basic one now
and<00:00:53.449> maybe<00:00:54.449> more<00:00:54.719> advanced<00:00:55.199> one<00:00:55.379> in<00:00:55.590> the

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
and maybe more advanced one in the

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.090 
and maybe more advanced one in the
future<00:00:55.980> to<00:00:56.250> come<00:00:56.280> and<00:00:56.610> maybe<00:00:56.820> two<00:00:57.180> parts<00:00:58.100> but

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
future to come and maybe two parts but

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.510 
future to come and maybe two parts but
anyway<00:01:00.140> if<00:01:01.140> you<00:01:01.260> go<00:01:01.379> on<00:01:01.500> the<00:01:01.620> objects<00:01:02.190> like<00:01:02.340> on

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
anyway if you go on the objects like on

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:03.590 
anyway if you go on the objects like on
here<00:01:02.730> you'll<00:01:02.879> see<00:01:02.910> there's<00:01:03.210> loads<00:01:03.449> of

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
here you'll see there's loads of

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.440 
here you'll see there's loads of
different<00:01:03.719> cubes<00:01:04.309> this<00:01:05.309> is<00:01:05.580> because<00:01:05.760> I'm<00:01:06.210> not

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
different cubes this is because I'm not

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.350 
different cubes this is because I'm not
exactly<00:01:06.930> familiar<00:01:07.860> with<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.280> clone<00:01:08.700> object

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
exactly familiar with the clone object

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.800 
exactly familiar with the clone object
so<00:01:10.130> I'm<00:01:11.130> going<00:01:11.460> to<00:01:11.520> be<00:01:11.610> doing<00:01:11.850> the<00:01:12.150> newbie<00:01:12.689> way

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
so I'm going to be doing the newbie way

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.070 
so I'm going to be doing the newbie way
of<00:01:13.020> copying<00:01:13.320> and<00:01:13.799> pasting<00:01:14.750> so<00:01:15.750> let's<00:01:15.930> get

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
of copying and pasting so let's get

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.210 
of copying and pasting so let's get
started<00:01:16.490> file<00:01:17.490> and<00:01:17.729> new<00:01:18.330> and<00:01:18.830> just<00:01:19.830> add<00:01:19.979> in<00:01:20.159> a

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
started file and new and just add in a

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.870 
started file and new and just add in a
cube<00:01:20.689> simple<00:01:21.799> hit<00:01:22.799> the<00:01:22.950> fill<00:01:23.280> it<00:01:23.400> or<00:01:23.610> fill

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
cube simple hit the fill it or fill

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.039 
cube simple hit the fill it or fill
eight<00:01:24.090> a<00:01:24.890> box<00:01:25.890> and<00:01:26.159> change<00:01:27.030> the<00:01:27.240> Philip<00:01:27.570> radius

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
eight a box and change the Philip radius

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:33.649 
eight a box and change the Philip radius
to<00:01:28.229> fifth<00:01:29.090> 15<00:01:30.090> and<00:01:31.579> you<00:01:32.579> see<00:01:32.790> that<00:01:33.000> it's<00:01:33.180> okay

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
to fifth 15 and you see that it's okay

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.950 
to fifth 15 and you see that it's okay
there<00:01:34.700> then<00:01:35.700> with<00:01:36.000> that<00:01:36.030> selected<00:01:36.479> hit

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
there then with that selected hit

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.340 
there then with that selected hit
control<00:01:37.409> C<00:01:37.439> and<00:01:38.009> ctrl<00:01:38.220> P<00:01:38.780> which<00:01:39.780> copy<00:01:40.110> and

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
control C and ctrl P which copy and

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.010 
control C and ctrl P which copy and
paste<00:01:40.619> it<00:01:40.979> so<00:01:41.400> I<00:01:41.430> all<00:01:41.880> go<00:01:42.030> to<00:01:42.090> edit<00:01:42.479> copy<00:01:42.750> in

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
paste it so I all go to edit copy in

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.530 
paste it so I all go to edit copy in
edit<00:01:43.229> paste<00:01:43.500> but<00:01:44.100> ctrl-c<00:01:44.700> ctrl-v<00:01:44.729> is<00:01:45.329> much

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
edit paste but ctrl-c ctrl-v is much

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.830 
edit paste but ctrl-c ctrl-v is much
quicker<00:01:46.670> then<00:01:47.670> on<00:01:47.759> the<00:01:47.880> X<00:01:48.090> you<00:01:48.360> want<00:01:48.540> to<00:01:48.630> type

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
quicker then on the X you want to type

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:57.770 
quicker then on the X you want to type
in<00:01:49.020> 200<00:01:50.149> apply<00:01:51.530> ctrl-c<00:01:52.530> ctrl-v<00:01:55.909> it<00:01:56.909> to<00:01:57.180> minus

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
in 200 apply ctrl-c ctrl-v it to minus

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.630 
in 200 apply ctrl-c ctrl-v it to minus
200<00:01:58.500> so<00:01:58.649> go<00:01:58.770> the<00:01:58.920> other<00:01:58.950> side<00:01:59.280> the<00:01:59.430> one<00:01:59.460> the

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
200 so go the other side the one the

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:05.359 
200 so go the other side the one the
middle<00:01:59.909> so<00:02:00.899> 0<00:02:01.409> minus<00:02:01.829> 200<00:02:02.490> and<00:02:02.670> 200<00:02:03.770> now<00:02:04.770> on

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
middle so 0 minus 200 and 200 now on

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:09.320 
middle so 0 minus 200 and 200 now on
that<00:02:05.579> one<00:02:05.759> go<00:02:05.909> ctrl-c<00:02:06.390> ctrl-v<00:02:06.420> and<00:02:08.149> change<00:02:09.149> the

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
that one go ctrl-c ctrl-v and change the

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.190 
that one go ctrl-c ctrl-v and change the
Y<00:02:09.569> to<00:02:09.979> 200<00:02:10.979> as<00:02:11.099> well<00:02:11.280> I<00:02:11.310> believe

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
Y to 200 as well I believe

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.039 
Y to 200 as well I believe
there<00:02:14.200> you<00:02:14.319> go<00:02:15.000> and<00:02:16.000> then<00:02:16.060> go<00:02:16.299> to<00:02:16.329> control<00:02:16.870> C

00:02:17.039 --> 00:02:17.049 
there you go and then go to control C

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:25.309 
there you go and then go to control C
control<00:02:17.079> V<00:02:17.439> and<00:02:19.200> go<00:02:20.200> to<00:02:20.430> zero<00:02:21.430> on<00:02:21.730> X<00:02:23.370> apply

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:25.319 
control V and go to zero on X apply

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:27.979 
control V and go to zero on X apply
actually<00:02:26.319> I<00:02:26.349> didn't<00:02:26.650> control<00:02:27.069> C<00:02:27.340> control<00:02:27.370> via

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:27.989 
actually I didn't control C control via

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:31.559 
actually I didn't control C control via
copy<00:02:28.989> and<00:02:29.200> paste<00:02:29.409> it<00:02:29.590> so<00:02:30.459> good<00:02:30.639> go<00:02:31.120> to<00:02:31.180> zero

00:02:31.559 --> 00:02:31.569 
copy and paste it so good go to zero

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:38.780 
copy and paste it so good go to zero
again<00:02:34.680> note<00:02:35.680> my<00:02:35.920> bad<00:02:36.129> change<00:02:36.519> the<00:02:36.670> Y<00:02:36.879> to<00:02:36.939> 200

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
again note my bad change the Y to 200

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:44.220 
again note my bad change the Y to 200
now<00:02:39.790> the<00:02:39.849> white<00:02:40.209> keep<00:02:40.629> kept<00:02:41.230> at<00:02:41.409> 200<00:02:43.019> but<00:02:44.019> you

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
now the white keep kept at 200 but you

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:48.119 
now the white keep kept at 200 but you
want<00:02:44.379> the<00:02:44.470> X<00:02:44.739> to<00:02:44.980> be<00:02:45.099> at<00:02:45.220> zero<00:02:46.049> apply<00:02:47.129> then

00:02:48.119 --> 00:02:48.129 
want the X to be at zero apply then

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:51.629 
want the X to be at zero apply then
control<00:02:48.609> C<00:02:48.819> control<00:02:48.849> V<00:02:49.409> and<00:02:50.409> the<00:02:51.010> X<00:02:51.189> to<00:02:51.430> be<00:02:51.519> at

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:51.639 
control C control V and the X to be at

00:02:51.639 --> 00:02:59.640 
control C control V and the X to be at
minus<00:02:52.419> 200<00:02:54.840> not<00:02:55.840> minus<00:02:56.290> 200<00:02:56.829> sorry<00:02:57.099> just<00:02:57.579> 200<00:02:58.650> a

minus 200 not minus 200 sorry just 200 a
common<00:03:00.159> sense<00:03:00.370> will<00:03:00.519> probably<00:03:00.819> figure<00:03:01.090> this

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:01.359 
common sense will probably figure this

00:03:01.359 --> 00:03:04.229 
common sense will probably figure this
out<00:03:01.510> for<00:03:01.750> you<00:03:01.810> guys<00:03:02.909> know<00:03:03.909> it's<00:03:04.060> kind<00:03:04.209> of

out for you guys know it's kind of

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:07.520 
out for you guys know it's kind of
tedious<00:03:04.480> maybe<00:03:04.930> watching<00:03:05.139> me<00:03:05.409> fail<00:03:05.889> as<00:03:06.280> I<00:03:06.549> am

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
tedious maybe watching me fail as I am

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:13.110 
tedious maybe watching me fail as I am
but<00:03:08.530> ctrl-c<00:03:09.280> ctrl-v<00:03:10.980> why<00:03:11.980> think<00:03:12.609> be<00:03:12.760> four

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
but ctrl-c ctrl-v why think be four

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:17.819 
but ctrl-c ctrl-v why think be four
hundred<00:03:14.549> that's<00:03:15.549> it<00:03:15.819> and<00:03:16.750> then<00:03:16.989> control

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:17.829 
hundred that's it and then control

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:22.789 
hundred that's it and then control
secret<00:03:18.069> Soviet<00:03:19.139> yeah<00:03:20.139> yeah<00:03:20.709> why<00:03:21.010> would<00:03:21.370> be

keep why the same and next at zero apply
and<00:03:30.069> then<00:03:30.099> last<00:03:30.699> one<00:03:31.139> and<00:03:32.139> I'll<00:03:32.290> show<00:03:32.530> you<00:03:32.560> why

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:32.889 
and then last one and I'll show you why

00:03:32.889 --> 00:03:37.289 
and then last one and I'll show you why
in<00:03:32.949> a<00:03:33.069> sec<00:03:33.430> change<00:03:33.879> the<00:03:34.030> x2<00:03:34.659> minus<00:03:35.609> 200<00:03:36.609> apply

00:03:37.289 --> 00:03:37.299 
in a sec change the x2 minus 200 apply

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:41.189 
in a sec change the x2 minus 200 apply
and<00:03:38.519> that<00:03:39.519> is<00:03:39.699> it<00:03:39.879> you<00:03:40.000> should<00:03:40.180> have<00:03:40.299> a<00:03:40.569> grid

00:03:41.189 --> 00:03:41.199 
and that is it you should have a grid

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:45.360 
and that is it you should have a grid
array<00:03:41.560> of<00:03:41.590> these<00:03:42.099> cubes<00:03:43.680> now<00:03:44.680> all<00:03:44.889> you<00:03:45.009> want<00:03:45.220> we

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:45.370 
array of these cubes now all you want we

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:47.099 
array of these cubes now all you want we
need<00:03:45.519> three<00:03:45.909> more<00:03:45.939> stacks<00:03:46.509> of<00:03:46.689> these<00:03:46.840> and<00:03:47.049> we

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:47.109 
need three more stacks of these and we

00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:50.129 
need three more stacks of these and we
be<00:03:47.169> done<00:03:47.409> so<00:03:48.069> hold<00:03:48.430> down<00:03:48.639> shift<00:03:49.030> and<00:03:49.269> open<00:03:49.870> top

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:50.139 
be done so hold down shift and open top

00:03:50.139 --> 00:03:54.569 
be done so hold down shift and open top
to<00:03:50.379> bottom<00:03:51.959> okay<00:03:52.959> top<00:03:53.379> to<00:03:53.560> bottom<00:03:53.590> and<00:03:54.129> let's

copy and then edit and paste and it will

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:04.589 
copy and then edit and paste and it will
just<00:04:02.769> paste<00:04:03.099> them<00:04:03.340> all<00:04:03.519> and<00:04:03.699> if<00:04:04.090> you<00:04:04.209> get<00:04:04.419> the

00:04:04.589 --> 00:04:04.599 
just paste them all and if you get the

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:07.050 
just paste them all and if you get the
blue<00:04:04.870> arrow<00:04:05.079> and<00:04:05.560> look<00:04:06.459> down<00:04:06.729> in<00:04:07.030> the

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:07.060 
blue arrow and look down in the

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:10.020 
blue arrow and look down in the
coordinates<00:04:07.930> down<00:04:08.199> here<00:04:08.680> you<00:04:09.549> see<00:04:09.759> what<00:04:09.909> one

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:10.030 
coordinates down here you see what one

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:13.409 
coordinates down here you see what one
is<00:04:10.150> changing<00:04:10.569> so<00:04:10.599> it's<00:04:10.870> the<00:04:11.019> Z<00:04:11.349> so<00:04:12.129> change<00:04:12.419> z2

00:04:13.409 --> 00:04:13.419 
is changing so it's the Z so change z2

00:04:13.419 --> 00:04:17.520 
is changing so it's the Z so change z2
minus<00:04:14.250> 200<00:04:15.509> that's<00:04:16.509> the<00:04:16.720> dimensions<00:04:17.289> of<00:04:17.380> the

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:17.530 
minus 200 that's the dimensions of the

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:21.529 
minus 200 that's the dimensions of the
cube<00:04:17.829> and<00:04:18.489> then<00:04:19.000> ctrl-c<00:04:19.659> ctrl-v<00:04:19.739> again<00:04:20.739> and

00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:21.539 
cube and then ctrl-c ctrl-v again and

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:25.200 
cube and then ctrl-c ctrl-v again and
change<00:04:22.539> it<00:04:22.719> to<00:04:22.750> minus<00:04:23.260> four<00:04:24.250> hundred<00:04:24.760> so<00:04:24.880> move

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:25.210 
change it to minus four hundred so move

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:25.580 
change it to minus four hundred so move
it

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:25.590 
it

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:30.790 
it
a little<00:04:25.949> bit<00:04:26.100> more<00:04:26.280> and<00:04:27.800> that<00:04:28.800> is<00:04:28.980> about<00:04:29.130> it

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:30.800 
a little bit more and that is about it

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:33.680 
a little bit more and that is about it
select<00:04:31.800> off<00:04:31.980> them<00:04:32.250> here<00:04:32.460> there<00:04:33.240> is<00:04:33.419> all<00:04:33.570> the

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:33.690 
select off them here there is all the

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:36.140 
select off them here there is all the
different<00:04:33.960> cubes<00:04:34.430> so<00:04:35.430> you've<00:04:35.520> got<00:04:35.550> the<00:04:35.699> basic

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:36.150 
different cubes so you've got the basic

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:38.930 
different cubes so you've got the basic
shape<00:04:36.180> for<00:04:36.720> the<00:04:36.810> Rubik's<00:04:37.490> all<00:04:38.490> that's<00:04:38.729> left<00:04:38.850> to

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:38.940 
shape for the Rubik's all that's left to

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:41.780 
shape for the Rubik's all that's left to
do<00:04:39.090> is<00:04:39.120> to<00:04:39.240> add<00:04:39.510> the<00:04:39.690> colors<00:04:40.280> so<00:04:41.280> if<00:04:41.520> you<00:04:41.639> just

going<00:04:59.340> to<00:04:59.400> make<00:04:59.520> this<00:04:59.550> one<00:04:59.850> and<00:05:00.060> green<00:05:03.169> solid

00:05:04.159 --> 00:05:04.169 
going to make this one and green solid

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:09.379 
going to make this one and green solid
green<00:05:04.410> there<00:05:04.740> we<00:05:04.830> go<00:05:06.229> green<00:05:07.229> is<00:05:07.560> the<00:05:08.490> blue<00:05:09.090> like

00:05:09.379 --> 00:05:09.389 
green there we go green is the blue like

00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:17.690 
green there we go green is the blue like
that<00:05:09.419> blue<00:05:10.910> their<00:05:11.910> dark<00:05:12.660> royal<00:05:13.200> blue<00:05:14.630> okay<00:05:16.700> and

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:17.700 
that blue their dark royal blue okay and

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:25.640 
that blue their dark royal blue okay and
clad<00:05:17.970> a<00:05:18.000> yellow<00:05:22.070> yellow<00:05:23.070> I<00:05:24.320> think<00:05:25.320> that's<00:05:25.530> all

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:25.650 
clad a yellow yellow I think that's all

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:27.230 
clad a yellow yellow I think that's all
the<00:05:25.740> colors<00:05:26.039> doesn't<00:05:26.280> it<00:05:26.340> as<00:05:26.610> well<00:05:26.880> as<00:05:26.970> white

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:27.240 
the colors doesn't it as well as white

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:28.670 
the colors doesn't it as well as white
obviously<00:05:27.780> but<00:05:27.990> you<00:05:28.110> can<00:05:28.229> just<00:05:28.260> leave<00:05:28.620> the

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:28.680 
obviously but you can just leave the

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:31.730 
obviously but you can just leave the
white<00:05:29.010> ones<00:05:29.250> as<00:05:29.400> they<00:05:29.460> are<00:05:30.169> you<00:05:31.169> know<00:05:31.289> I<00:05:31.320> think

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:31.740 
white ones as they are you know I think

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:35.560 
white ones as they are you know I think
it<00:05:32.010> is<00:05:32.039> anyway<00:05:32.880> if<00:05:33.270> not<00:05:33.630> my<00:05:34.260> mistake<00:05:34.680> you<00:05:35.010> know

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:35.570 
it is anyway if not my mistake you know

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:38.779 
it is anyway if not my mistake you know
that<00:05:36.570> they'll<00:05:36.720> be<00:05:36.750> another<00:05:37.229> one<00:05:37.460> but<00:05:38.460> anyways

00:05:38.779 --> 00:05:38.789 
that they'll be another one but anyways

00:05:38.789 --> 00:05:41.260 
that they'll be another one but anyways
drag<00:05:39.330> them<00:05:39.450> on<00:05:39.600> so<00:05:40.200> with<00:05:40.410> a<00:05:40.440> red<00:05:40.740> one<00:05:40.950> just

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:41.270 
drag them on so with a red one just

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:44.810 
drag them on so with a red one just
choose<00:05:42.270> a<00:05:42.860> point<00:05:43.860> on<00:05:44.099> the<00:05:44.130> cube<00:05:44.520> and<00:05:44.729> should

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:44.820 
choose a point on the cube and should

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:48.200 
choose a point on the cube and should
drag<00:05:45.030> it<00:05:45.150> on<00:05:45.270> and<00:05:46.190> just<00:05:47.190> pretty<00:05:47.460> much<00:05:47.580> drag<00:05:48.000> and

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:48.210 
drag it on and just pretty much drag and

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:51.140 
drag it on and just pretty much drag and
drop<00:05:48.450> it<00:05:49.610> anything<00:05:50.610> you<00:05:50.669> want<00:05:50.789> to<00:05:50.849> be<00:05:50.940> white

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:51.150 
drop it anything you want to be white

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:55.730 
drop it anything you want to be white
you<00:05:51.270> just<00:05:51.479> leave<00:05:51.750> it<00:05:51.960> as<00:05:52.080> it<00:05:52.349> is<00:05:54.530> should<00:05:55.530> just

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:55.740 
you just leave it as it is should just

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:57.379 
you just leave it as it is should just
do<00:05:55.830> this<00:05:55.950> face<00:05:56.220> to<00:05:56.250> show<00:05:56.880> you<00:05:56.940> for<00:05:57.210> time

00:05:57.379 --> 00:05:57.389 
do this face to show you for time

00:05:57.389 --> 00:06:00.400 
do this face to show you for time
purposes<00:05:57.630> so<00:05:58.020> you<00:05:58.110> don't<00:05:58.260> get<00:05:58.380> too<00:05:58.650> bored

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:00.410 
purposes so you don't get too bored

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:06.200 
purposes so you don't get too bored
greener<00:06:01.410> another<00:06:02.900> red<00:06:03.900> I<00:06:03.930> think<00:06:04.260> and<00:06:05.210> there

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:06.210 
greener another red I think and there

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:10.760 
greener another red I think and there
you<00:06:06.300> go<00:06:06.360> that's<00:06:06.930> basically<00:06:07.410> one<00:06:07.740> face<00:06:08.039> and<00:06:09.770> you

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:10.770 
you go that's basically one face and you

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:12.440 
you go that's basically one face and you
just<00:06:10.950> keep<00:06:11.160> doing<00:06:11.220> this<00:06:11.580> to<00:06:11.880> throughout<00:06:12.240> all

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:12.450 
just keep doing this to throughout all

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:17.469 
just keep doing this to throughout all
the<00:06:12.630> other<00:06:12.720> squares<00:06:13.169> hard<00:06:14.070> drag<00:06:14.460> and<00:06:14.639> drop<00:06:16.310> but

00:06:17.469 --> 00:06:17.479 
the other squares hard drag and drop but

00:06:17.479 --> 00:06:20.240 
the other squares hard drag and drop but
there<00:06:18.479> you<00:06:18.630> have<00:06:18.660> the<00:06:18.780> basic<00:06:19.349> rubik's<00:06:19.950> cube

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:20.250 
there you have the basic rubik's cube

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:21.680 
there you have the basic rubik's cube
shape<00:06:20.490> but<00:06:20.849> as<00:06:20.970> you've<00:06:21.180> seen<00:06:21.419> at<00:06:21.599> the

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:21.690 
shape but as you've seen at the

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:25.129 
shape but as you've seen at the
beginning<00:06:22.110> it<00:06:22.229> had<00:06:22.500> it<00:06:22.620> had<00:06:22.650> a<00:06:22.770> plane<00:06:23.599> so<00:06:24.599> click

00:06:25.129 --> 00:06:25.139 
beginning it had it had a plane so click

00:06:25.139 --> 00:06:28.310 
beginning it had it had a plane so click
and<00:06:25.289> hold<00:06:25.410> on<00:06:25.590> the<00:06:25.650> square<00:06:25.950> go<00:06:26.190> to<00:06:26.250> plane<00:06:26.849> a<00:06:27.320> lot

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:28.320 
and hold on the square go to plane a lot

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:32.719 
and hold on the square go to plane a lot
to<00:06:28.470> type<00:06:28.680> in<00:06:30.139> 97<00:06:31.139> times<00:06:31.410> don't<00:06:32.280> how<00:06:32.340> many<00:06:32.520> times

00:06:32.719 --> 00:06:32.729 
to type in 97 times don't how many times

00:06:32.729 --> 00:06:35.890 
to type in 97 times don't how many times
I<00:06:32.849> was<00:06:33.000> but<00:06:33.210> anyway

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:35.900 

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:38.530 

stop<00:06:36.229> budgeted<00:06:36.800> for<00:06:37.009> this<00:06:37.130> at<00:06:37.250> nine<00:06:37.520> knows<00:06:38.180> no

stop budgeted for this at nine knows no
more<00:06:38.720> the<00:06:38.930> car<00:06:39.139> count<00:06:39.410> can<00:06:39.560> I<00:06:39.590> anyway<00:06:40.370> and<00:06:41.240> then

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:41.330 
more the car count can I anyway and then

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:42.550 
more the car count can I anyway and then
once<00:06:41.509> you've<00:06:41.600> got<00:06:41.690> a<00:06:41.720> plane<00:06:41.990> it<00:06:42.199> might<00:06:42.320> be<00:06:42.530> just

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:42.560 
once you've got a plane it might be just

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:44.740 
once you've got a plane it might be just
halfway<00:06:43.130> through<00:06:43.550> the<00:06:43.669> squares<00:06:43.970> so<00:06:44.210> just<00:06:44.419> drag

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:44.750 
halfway through the squares so just drag

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:49.420 
halfway through the squares so just drag
it<00:06:44.780> down<00:06:45.910> just<00:06:46.910> under<00:06:47.060> the<00:06:47.300> bottom<00:06:47.810> and<00:06:48.310> if<00:06:49.310> you

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:49.430 
it down just under the bottom and if you

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:53.830 
it down just under the bottom and if you
go<00:06:49.550> to<00:06:49.610> file<00:06:50.470> shader<00:06:51.470> and<00:06:51.759> nuki<00:06:52.759> nuki<00:06:53.539> is

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:53.840 
go to file shader and nuki nuki is

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:55.540 
go to file shader and nuki nuki is
basically<00:06:54.199> just<00:06:54.229> a<00:06:54.440> glossy<00:06:54.919> blue<00:06:55.130> that<00:06:55.370> gives

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:55.550 
basically just a glossy blue that gives

00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:58.600 
basically just a glossy blue that gives
her<00:06:55.639> a<00:06:55.699> bit<00:06:55.880> of<00:06:55.970> reflection<00:06:57.310> then<00:06:58.310> to<00:06:58.520> actually

00:06:58.600 --> 00:06:58.610 
her a bit of reflection then to actually

00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:00.430 
her a bit of reflection then to actually
make<00:06:59.000> it<00:06:59.270> have<00:06:59.479> a<00:06:59.509> reflection<00:06:59.960> need<00:07:00.199> to<00:07:00.289> add<00:07:00.410> a

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:00.440 
make it have a reflection need to add a

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:02.590 
make it have a reflection need to add a
light<00:07:00.800> so<00:07:01.250> just<00:07:01.400> go<00:07:01.520> to<00:07:01.580> the<00:07:01.729> four<00:07:02.000> hours<00:07:02.210> x

00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:02.600 
light so just go to the four hours x

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:06.270 
light so just go to the four hours x

that<00:07:09.860> we're<00:07:09.949> working<00:07:10.100> on<00:07:11.110> render<00:07:12.110> that<00:07:12.199> out

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:12.380 
that we're working on render that out

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:16.870 
that we're working on render that out
and<00:07:14.229> you<00:07:15.229> see<00:07:15.560> that<00:07:15.740> it's<00:07:15.860> got<00:07:15.949> a<00:07:16.100> reflection

00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:16.880 
and you see that it's got a reflection

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:18.939 
and you see that it's got a reflection
but<00:07:17.419> to<00:07:17.630> get<00:07:17.750> the<00:07:17.900> shadows<00:07:18.350> you<00:07:18.560> need<00:07:18.680> to<00:07:18.770> go<00:07:18.889> to

00:07:18.939 --> 00:07:18.949 
but to get the shadows you need to go to

00:07:18.949 --> 00:07:23.439 
but to get the shadows you need to go to
shadow<00:07:19.760> and<00:07:20.150> shadow<00:07:21.139> map<00:07:21.440> soft<00:07:22.330> render<00:07:23.330> out

00:07:23.439 --> 00:07:23.449 
shadow and shadow map soft render out

00:07:23.449 --> 00:07:25.840 
shadow and shadow map soft render out
again<00:07:23.780> and<00:07:24.280> there<00:07:25.280> you<00:07:25.400> go<00:07:25.460> you<00:07:25.580> have<00:07:25.729> a
