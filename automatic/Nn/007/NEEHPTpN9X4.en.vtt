00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:03.449 
hi my name is Ben Tommy Erickson and I

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:05.990 
hi my name is Ben Tommy Erickson and I
want<00:00:03.720> to<00:00:03.959> show<00:00:04.529> you<00:00:04.589> how<00:00:05.190> to<00:00:05.250> make<00:00:05.700> liquid

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:06.000 
want to show you how to make liquid

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.960 
want to show you how to make liquid
water<00:00:06.779> or<00:00:07.170> some<00:00:07.470> other<00:00:07.560> liquids<00:00:08.069> in<00:00:08.400> tutorial

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
water or some other liquids in tutorial

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.650 
water or some other liquids in tutorial
in<00:00:09.809> the<00:00:10.080> tutorial<00:00:10.980> in<00:00:11.099> light-weight<00:00:11.660> the

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
in the tutorial in light-weight the

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.079 
in the tutorial in light-weight the
first<00:00:12.900> thing<00:00:13.110> I<00:00:13.230> got<00:00:13.410> need<00:00:14.219> to<00:00:14.340> do<00:00:14.490> is<00:00:14.730> go<00:00:15.030> to

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
first thing I got need to do is go to

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.470 
first thing I got need to do is go to
item<00:00:15.599> and<00:00:15.839> an<00:00:16.020> ami<00:00:16.379> can<00:00:16.920> add<00:00:17.310> some<00:00:17.789> particles

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
item and an ami can add some particles

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.529 
item and an ami can add some particles
the<00:00:18.930> particles<00:00:18.960> is<00:00:19.710> what's<00:00:20.430> going<00:00:20.820> to<00:00:20.880> be<00:00:21.090> the

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
the particles is what's going to be the

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.040 
the particles is what's going to be the
water<00:00:22.820> so<00:00:23.820> I<00:00:23.850> call<00:00:24.150> the<00:00:24.240> particle<00:00:24.779> emitter

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
water so I call the particle emitter

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.509 
water so I call the particle emitter
water<00:00:25.970> and<00:00:26.970> add<00:00:27.150> it<00:00:27.330> to<00:00:27.689> the<00:00:27.810> scene<00:00:28.220> but<00:00:29.220> is<00:00:29.369> it

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
water and add it to the scene but is it

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.260 
water and add it to the scene but is it
a<00:00:29.609> little<00:00:29.730> bit<00:00:29.910> up<00:00:30.240> so<00:00:31.109> I<00:00:31.140> can<00:00:31.410> see<00:00:31.560> it<00:00:31.619> I<00:00:32.270> like

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
a little bit up so I can see it I like

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.270 
a little bit up so I can see it I like
to<00:00:33.300> animate<00:00:33.809> this<00:00:34.050> thing<00:00:34.320> when<00:00:34.559> I'm<00:00:34.710> working

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
to animate this thing when I'm working

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:43.369 
to animate this thing when I'm working
with<00:00:35.489> this<00:00:35.640> I<00:00:40.640> try<00:00:41.640> to<00:00:42.260> increase<00:00:43.260> the

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
with this I try to increase the

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:50.240 
with this I try to increase the
birthrate<00:00:45.890> the<00:00:46.890> limit<00:00:47.460> is<00:00:47.989> limiting<00:00:48.989> how<00:00:49.920> many

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
birthrate the limit is limiting how many

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.209 
birthrate the limit is limiting how many
particles<00:00:50.850> in<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:51.780> scene<00:00:52.020> at<00:00:52.230> the<00:00:52.710> same<00:00:52.920> time

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
particles in the scene at the same time

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.959 
particles in the scene at the same time
and<00:00:53.510> some<00:00:54.510> other<00:00:54.690> thing<00:00:54.960> it's<00:00:55.170> the<00:00:55.969> lifetime

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
and some other thing it's the lifetime

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.840 
and some other thing it's the lifetime
of<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:57.449> particles<00:00:57.930> my<00:00:58.559> animation<00:00:59.309> is<00:00:59.489> only

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
of the particles my animation is only

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.250 
of the particles my animation is only
hundred<00:01:00.329> and<00:01:00.559> twenty<00:01:01.559> frames<00:01:02.100> so<00:01:02.460> the

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:03.260 
hundred and twenty frames so the

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.109 
hundred and twenty frames so the
lifetime<00:01:04.260> of<00:01:04.619> this<00:01:04.949> particle<00:01:05.519> don't<00:01:05.760> have<00:01:05.970> to

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
lifetime of this particle don't have to

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.859 
lifetime of this particle don't have to
be<00:01:06.240> higher<00:01:06.570> than<00:01:06.840> this<00:01:08.240> the<00:01:09.240> next<00:01:09.540> thing<00:01:09.720> I

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
be higher than this the next thing I

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:15.080 
be higher than this the next thing I
need<00:01:10.680> to<00:01:10.799> do<00:01:10.950> is<00:01:11.220> adding<00:01:11.840> some<00:01:12.840> gravity<00:01:13.799> I<00:01:14.090> like

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
need to do is adding some gravity I like

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.580 
need to do is adding some gravity I like
to<00:01:15.240> do<00:01:15.390> it<00:01:15.570> separately<00:01:17.810> and<00:01:18.810> now<00:01:19.080> you<00:01:19.140> can<00:01:19.439> see

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
to do it separately and now you can see

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.859 
to do it separately and now you can see
that<00:01:20.479> the<00:01:21.479> water<00:01:21.659> is<00:01:21.900> flowing<00:01:22.350> but<00:01:23.869> the

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
that the water is flowing but the

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.770 
that the water is flowing but the
gravity<00:01:25.350> is<00:01:25.409> much<00:01:25.860> higher<00:01:26.340> in<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:27.299> real<00:01:27.479> world

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
gravity is much higher in the real world

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:33.020 
gravity is much higher in the real world
i<00:01:28.049> adding<00:01:28.710> 9.8<00:01:30.829> standard<00:01:31.829> and<00:01:32.610> you<00:01:32.700> can<00:01:32.880> see

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
i adding 9.8 standard and you can see

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:38.910 
i adding 9.8 standard and you can see
the<00:01:33.150> water<00:01:33.360> is<00:01:33.890> is<00:01:34.890> falling

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:38.920 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:44.070 

the<00:01:39.490> next<00:01:39.820> thing<00:01:40.000> I<00:01:40.120> want<00:01:40.810> to<00:01:40.930> do<00:01:41.080> is<00:01:41.640> to<00:01:43.080> have

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:44.080 
the next thing I want to do is to have

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:46.140 
the next thing I want to do is to have
something<00:01:44.680> that's<00:01:44.890> happening<00:01:45.730> to<00:01:45.910> the<00:01:46.030> water

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:46.150 
something that's happening to the water

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:49.020 
something that's happening to the water
I'm<00:01:46.630> going<00:01:46.930> to<00:01:47.050> increase<00:01:47.530> this<00:01:47.830> the<00:01:48.580> camera

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:49.030 
I'm going to increase this the camera

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:52.190 
I'm going to increase this the camera
setting<00:01:49.630> so<00:01:49.810> we<00:01:49.840> can<00:01:50.200> see<00:01:50.440> a<00:01:50.470> little<00:01:50.680> bit<00:01:50.920> more

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
setting so we can see a little bit more

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.850 
setting so we can see a little bit more
here<00:01:53.200> because<00:01:53.380> of<00:01:53.740> my<00:01:53.920> small<00:01:54.160> screen<00:01:55.590> the<00:01:56.590> next

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:56.860 
here because of my small screen the next

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:02.540 
here because of my small screen the next
thing<00:01:56.979> is<00:01:57.160> to<00:01:57.900> add<00:01:58.900> a<00:01:59.170> coalition<00:02:00.960> so<00:02:01.960> the<00:02:02.110> water

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:02.550 
thing is to add a coalition so the water

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:07.590 
thing is to add a coalition so the water
is<00:02:04.020> have<00:02:05.020> something<00:02:05.410> to<00:02:05.560> hit<00:02:05.740> I'm<00:02:06.640> increasing

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:07.600 
is have something to hit I'm increasing

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
is have something to hit I'm increasing
this<00:02:07.810> collection<00:02:08.649> objects<00:02:09.039> 250<00:02:10.030> pounds

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:10.620 
this collection objects 250 pounds

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:17.430 
this collection objects 250 pounds
present<00:02:12.510> and<00:02:13.620> I'm<00:02:14.620> going<00:02:15.040> to<00:02:15.690> clone<00:02:16.690> this<00:02:16.959> item

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
present and I'm going to clone this item

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.810 
present and I'm going to clone this item
just<00:02:17.790> to<00:02:18.790> make<00:02:19.390> this<00:02:20.040> even<00:02:21.040> a<00:02:21.190> little<00:02:21.220> bit<00:02:21.610> more

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:21.820 
just to make this even a little bit more

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:24.449 
just to make this even a little bit more
Justin<00:02:22.600> and<00:02:23.200> you<00:02:23.230> can<00:02:23.530> see<00:02:23.650> here<00:02:23.890> the<00:02:24.070> water<00:02:24.280> is

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:24.459 
Justin and you can see here the water is

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:26.400 
Justin and you can see here the water is
bouncing<00:02:25.150> around<00:02:25.300> on<00:02:25.630> this<00:02:25.870> collection

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
bouncing around on this collection

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:32.280 
bouncing around on this collection
objects<00:02:28.380> but<00:02:29.380> if<00:02:29.890> I<00:02:30.130> now<00:02:30.510> try<00:02:31.510> to<00:02:31.600> render<00:02:31.959> this

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
objects but if I now try to render this

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.630 
objects but if I now try to render this
the<00:02:33.100> scene<00:02:33.310> is<00:02:33.459> black<00:02:33.900> totally<00:02:34.900> black<00:02:35.520> and<00:02:36.520> the

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
the scene is black totally black and the

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.860 
the scene is black totally black and the
reason<00:02:37.030> for<00:02:37.209> this<00:02:37.330> is<00:02:37.390> I<00:02:37.900> haven't<00:02:38.230> added<00:02:38.650> some

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
reason for this is I haven't added some

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.810 
reason for this is I haven't added some
hyper<00:02:40.870> Boxley<00:02:41.440> yet<00:02:41.620> and<00:02:42.220> at<00:02:42.370> the<00:02:42.459> effects

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:42.820 
hyper Boxley yet and at the effects

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:45.830 
hyper Boxley yet and at the effects
tools<00:02:43.120> you<00:02:43.480> have<00:02:43.510> some<00:02:43.930> bottom<00:02:44.620> make<00:02:45.190> happy

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
tools you have some bottom make happy

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:50.880 
tools you have some bottom make happy
voxels<00:02:46.840> and<00:02:47.290> I<00:02:48.220> click<00:02:48.640> this<00:02:49.230> every<00:02:50.230> object<00:02:50.799> you

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:57.240 
have in the scene will be in this list
and<00:02:53.799> if<00:02:54.100> I<00:02:54.250> go<00:02:54.430> to<00:02:54.459> water<00:02:55.299> and<00:02:56.040> activate<00:02:57.040> this

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
and if I go to water and activate this

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:03.380 
and if I go to water and activate this
then<00:02:58.209> the<00:02:58.480> water<00:02:58.690> is<00:02:58.900> going<00:02:59.500> to<00:02:59.650> render

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:10.250 

I<00:03:03.710> said<00:03:04.710> some<00:03:05.070> particle<00:03:05.850> size<00:03:06.140> and<00:03:09.230> now<00:03:10.230> I

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
I said some particle size and now I

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:15.800 
I said some particle size and now I
going<00:03:10.830> to<00:03:11.240> change<00:03:12.470> how<00:03:13.470> the<00:03:14.310> radius<00:03:14.730> of<00:03:15.510> this

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
going to change how the radius of this

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:19.490 
going to change how the radius of this
particle<00:03:16.500> to<00:03:16.620> mimic<00:03:17.520> the<00:03:17.940> water<00:03:18.180> the<00:03:18.960> color<00:03:19.170> of

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
particle to mimic the water the color of

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:25.760 
particle to mimic the water the color of

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380 
and sorry diffusion is nearly hundred

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:36.460 
and sorry diffusion is nearly hundred
percent<00:03:31.740> and<00:03:32.040> specularity<00:03:32.700> is<00:03:33.209> also<00:03:34.850> about

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470 
percent and specularity is also about

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:47.619 
percent and specularity is also about
1900<00:03:38.330> and<00:03:40.430> the<00:03:41.430> glossiness<00:03:42.260> is<00:03:43.260> to<00:03:43.500> say

00:03:47.619 --> 00:03:47.629 

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:50.979 

the<00:03:48.230> water<00:03:48.530> isn't<00:03:48.999> showing<00:03:49.999> especially<00:03:50.810> good

00:03:50.979 --> 00:03:50.989 
the water isn't showing especially good

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:53.440 
the water isn't showing especially good
now<00:03:51.530> and<00:03:52.010> there<00:03:52.159> is<00:03:52.189> a<00:03:52.280> several<00:03:52.819> reason<00:03:53.269> for

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:53.450 
now and there is a several reason for

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:55.750 
now and there is a several reason for
this<00:03:54.310> the<00:03:55.310> water

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:55.760 
this the water

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:00.699 
this the water
I<00:03:56.170> had<00:03:57.170> reflection<00:03:58.010> about<00:03:58.749> 2013-present<00:03:59.749> and

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:00.709 
I had reflection about 2013-present and

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:04.720 
I had reflection about 2013-present and
transfer<00:04:01.599> Perrin<00:04:02.599> see<00:04:02.840> about<00:04:03.370> the<00:04:04.370> rest<00:04:04.579> of

transfer Perrin see about the rest of

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:07.869 
transfer Perrin see about the rest of
hundreds<00:04:05.180> present<00:04:05.980> but<00:04:06.980> to<00:04:07.099> make<00:04:07.579> the<00:04:07.700> water

hundreds present but to make the water
look<00:04:08.180> oily<00:04:08.689> naturally<00:04:09.139> I<00:04:09.379> need<00:04:09.920> to<00:04:10.159> act<00:04:10.459> at

00:04:10.899 --> 00:04:10.909 
look oily naturally I need to act at

00:04:10.909 --> 00:04:13.959 
look oily naturally I need to act at
some<00:04:10.939> background<00:04:11.599> and<00:04:12.280> then<00:04:13.280> go<00:04:13.430> to<00:04:13.489> action

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:13.969 
some background and then go to action

00:04:13.969 --> 00:04:21.510 
some background and then go to action
options<00:04:14.450> and<00:04:14.780> add<00:04:15.349> some<00:04:17.560> scratches<00:04:18.560> I<00:04:20.049> can

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:21.520 
options and add some scratches I can

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:25.600 
options and add some scratches I can
enable<00:04:22.520> some<00:04:23.150> clouds<00:04:23.479> to<00:04:23.960> to<00:04:24.410> even<00:04:24.680> make<00:04:25.550> it

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:25.610 
enable some clouds to to even make it

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:31.260 
enable some clouds to to even make it
more<00:04:25.789> natural<00:04:27.370> now<00:04:28.370> the<00:04:28.430> water<00:04:28.759> is<00:04:29.060> way<00:04:29.870> better

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:31.270 
more natural now the water is way better

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:34.240 
more natural now the water is way better
in<00:04:32.270> the<00:04:32.419> real<00:04:32.660> world<00:04:32.960> the<00:04:33.470> water<00:04:33.680> has<00:04:33.979> some

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:34.250 
in the real world the water has some

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:44.090 
in the real world the water has some
refraction<00:04:35.060> and<00:04:35.960> I<00:04:36.199> can<00:04:36.440> add<00:04:37.009> that

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:44.100 

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:46.460 

the<00:04:44.640> problem<00:04:44.970> with<00:04:45.180> refraction<00:04:45.720> is<00:04:45.840> rendering

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:46.470 
the problem with refraction is rendering

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:51.200 
the problem with refraction is rendering
time<00:04:46.800> is<00:04:47.010> very<00:04:47.550> worried<00:04:48.470> increasing<00:04:50.210> my

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:51.210 
time is very worried increasing my

00:04:51.210 --> 00:05:01.090 
time is very worried increasing my
grandeur<00:04:51.660> of<00:04:51.690> this<00:04:52.050> see<00:04:52.680> how<00:04:52.860> it<00:04:53.040> looks

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:01.100 

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:04.260 

yes<00:05:01.730> Sundberg<00:05:02.300> so<00:05:02.630> this<00:05:02.900> is<00:05:03.080> the<00:05:03.260> first<00:05:03.470> test

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:04.270 
yes Sundberg so this is the first test

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:07.750 
yes Sundberg so this is the first test
this<00:05:05.270> is<00:05:05.480> how<00:05:05.660> the<00:05:05.720> water<00:05:05.960> looks<00:05:06.350> we<00:05:07.010> can<00:05:07.310> maybe

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:07.760 
this is how the water looks we can maybe

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:12.600 
this is how the water looks we can maybe
increase<00:05:08.830> the<00:05:09.830> reflection<00:05:10.490> and<00:05:11.240> maybe

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:12.610 
increase the reflection and maybe

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:13.840 
increase the reflection and maybe
transparency

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:13.850 
transparency

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:19.090 
transparency
what<00:05:14.840> is<00:05:15.110> object<00:05:15.830> a<00:05:15.950> little<00:05:16.220> bit<00:05:17.020> and<00:05:18.020> maybe<00:05:18.740> we

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:19.100 
what is object a little bit and maybe we

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:22.410 
what is object a little bit and maybe we
are<00:05:19.190> going<00:05:19.520> to<00:05:19.730> increase<00:05:20.120> the<00:05:20.180> size<00:05:20.600> of<00:05:21.070> this

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:22.420 
are going to increase the size of this

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:29.250 
are going to increase the size of this
and<00:05:23.420> that's<00:05:24.430> turning<00:05:25.430> under<00:05:26.680> geometric<00:05:28.090> maybe

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:29.260 
and that's turning under geometric maybe

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:39.200 
and that's turning under geometric maybe
250<00:05:30.260> will<00:05:30.770> be<00:05:30.980> a<00:05:31.550> little<00:05:31.730> bit<00:05:31.940> more<00:05:32.380> realistic

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:39.210 

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:41.809 

I<00:05:39.270> like<00:05:39.960> to<00:05:40.139> turn<00:05:40.319> off<00:05:40.530> this<00:05:40.800> refraction<00:05:41.400> index

00:05:41.809 --> 00:05:41.819 
I like to turn off this refraction index

00:05:41.819 --> 00:05:44.029 
I like to turn off this refraction index
when<00:05:42.090> I'm<00:05:42.240> working<00:05:42.810> so<00:05:43.050> let's<00:05:43.289> render<00:05:43.740> much

00:05:44.029 --> 00:05:44.039 
when I'm working so let's render much

00:05:44.039 --> 00:05:51.070 
when I'm working so let's render much
faster<00:05:45.740> it<00:05:46.740> this<00:05:47.220> is<00:05:47.479> more<00:05:48.500> divided<00:05:49.500> like<00:05:49.740> so<00:05:50.340> I

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:51.080 
faster it this is more divided like so I

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:54.200 
faster it this is more divided like so I
think<00:05:52.080> we're<00:05:52.440> going<00:05:52.560> to<00:05:52.680> leave<00:05:53.009> this<00:05:53.220> for<00:05:54.180> now

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:54.210 
think we're going to leave this for now

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:57.920 
think we're going to leave this for now
and<00:05:54.360> I'm<00:05:55.139> going<00:05:55.229> to<00:05:55.590> render<00:05:55.949> their<00:05:56.449> movies<00:05:57.449> so

00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:57.930 
and I'm going to render their movies so

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:00.140 
and I'm going to render their movies so
you<00:05:57.960> can<00:05:58.229> see<00:05:58.410> how<00:05:58.560> it's<00:05:58.800> look<00:05:58.979> like<00:05:59.009> I<00:05:59.550> hope

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:00.150 
you can see how it's look like I hope

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:02.779 
you can see how it's look like I hope
you<00:06:00.330> liked<00:06:00.539> my<00:06:00.569> tutorial<00:06:01.169> and<00:06:01.949> please<00:06:02.310> please
