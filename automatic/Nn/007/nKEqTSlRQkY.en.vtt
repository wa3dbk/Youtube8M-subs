00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.850
 or 

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:08.850
 good 

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:15.700
 why 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.830
 and 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:32.060
 we cut the eggs and 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.060
 we empty with the help of a knife 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:39.820
 we chop up what we just got out and what 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:43.020
 we mix with the mayonnaise and we do the 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:43.020
 same with the crab sticks 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:49.470
 do not 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:56.089
 two 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:58.570
 with that mixture we fill the halves of 

00:00:56.089 --> 00:00:58.570
 the eggs 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:05.409
 we cut the olives in half 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:07.540
 we put a part on the egg and the 

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:10.560
 another we cut in strips to make 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:10.560
 the legs of the spiders 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:14.650
 do not 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:37.030
 good 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:42.760
 we put the pizzas next cheese 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:45.950
 chopped up 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:47.869
 the eyes of mummies like olives 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:50.920
 you just have to put them in the oven until 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:50.920
 that look good 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.270
 we heat the sausages in the 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:04.670
 microwave and cut pieces of cheese 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:07.060
 for the nails and we made done for the 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.060
 blood 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:20.420
 on the bread we put the hamburgers 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:24.069
 previously made in the pan and over 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.069
 the cut cheese in the shape of a pumpkin 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:36.450
 we beat two yolks with 60 grams of 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.910
 sugar when they are sparkling we add 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:42.770
 60 milliliters of oil and raisins and 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:42.770
 chopped almonds and mix well 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.660
 two 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:52.270
 pour the mixture in a volcano of 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:55.620
 flour and knead until the 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:55.620
 dough does not stick on the table 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.800
 or not 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:05.020
 for a moment 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:12.300
 after letting it rest a few minutes 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:14.400
 we are making the shape of the fingers of 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:18.380
 the witch and we are placing them on the 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.380
 lined tray with baking paper 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:45.730
 when we have the shape made him 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:48.790
 we stick one end of an almond to 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:51.460
 look like the nail we join with 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:53.860
 egg and put them in the oven between 15 

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:55.960
 and 20 minutes I did them too 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:57.820
 short and even above I missed the 

00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:01.710
 time so more than a few fingers 

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:01.710
 witch I have got some orc fingers 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:17.280
 one 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:19.320
 with the melted chocolate we decorate by 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:21.329
 inside the glasses and the glasses as more 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:23.389
 we like it and let them cool down in the 

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:23.389
 fridge 

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:33.570
 i 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:45.930
 when the chocolate is solid only 

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:45.930
 we have to serve the drinks 

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:59.720
 we can take some ice that we have 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:02.830
 frozen with a spider treat or 

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:02.830
 worm inside 

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:14.780
