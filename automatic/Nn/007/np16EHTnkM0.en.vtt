rest<00:00:33.180> for<00:00:33.420> like<00:00:33.899> i<00:00:33.989> said<00:00:34.050> it<00:00:34.380> will<00:00:34.710> fit<00:00:35.340> with

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
rest for like i said it will fit with

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.220 
rest for like i said it will fit with
your<00:00:35.730> original<00:00:35.910> s4<00:00:36.300> cover<00:00:36.540> so<00:00:36.870> if<00:00:36.930> i<00:00:37.020> go<00:00:37.140> ahead

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
your original s4 cover so if i go ahead

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.410 
your original s4 cover so if i go ahead
and<00:00:37.410> take<00:00:37.530> that<00:00:37.649> off<00:00:37.829> and<00:00:38.489> pop<00:00:38.700> the<00:00:38.820> s4<00:00:39.120> back<00:00:39.270> on

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
and take that off and pop the s4 back on

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.660 
and take that off and pop the s4 back on
the<00:00:39.510> table<00:00:39.719> and<00:00:40.200> just<00:00:40.800> draw<00:00:41.489> your<00:00:41.610> attention

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
the table and just draw your attention

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.660 
the table and just draw your attention
to<00:00:42.149> this<00:00:42.360> tab<00:00:42.690> here<00:00:42.930> which<00:00:43.050> features<00:00:43.469> two<00:00:44.250> gold

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
to this tab here which features two gold

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.779 
to this tab here which features two gold
keys<00:00:45.090> like<00:00:45.719> so<00:00:46.050> that<00:00:46.320> if<00:00:46.530> we<00:00:46.800> pick<00:00:47.010> up<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.309> s4

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
keys like so that if we pick up the s4

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:53.119 
keys like so that if we pick up the s4
or<00:00:48.450> fit<00:00:48.809> into<00:00:49.370> the<00:00:50.370> two<00:00:50.610> gold<00:00:51.180> ports<00:00:51.719> there<00:00:52.199> see

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
or fit into the two gold ports there see

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.540 
or fit into the two gold ports there see
and<00:00:53.579> then<00:00:53.820> it'll<00:00:54.000> just<00:00:54.239> sit<00:00:54.780> nicely<00:00:55.170> on<00:00:55.440> to<00:00:56.160> s4

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
and then it'll just sit nicely on to s4

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.160 
and then it'll just sit nicely on to s4
so<00:00:56.789> then<00:00:56.910> you<00:00:56.969> can<00:00:57.059> go<00:00:57.149> ahead<00:00:57.270> and<00:00:57.600> take<00:00:57.989> your

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
so then you can go ahead and take your

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:04.179 
so then you can go ahead and take your
original<00:00:58.289> s4<00:00:58.890> cover<00:00:59.160> and<00:00:59.750> clip<00:01:00.750> it<00:01:00.870> back<00:01:00.899> on

00:01:04.179 --> 00:01:04.189 

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:07.399 

like<00:01:05.189> so<00:01:05.790> now<00:01:06.299> i<00:01:06.330> will<00:01:06.689> say<00:01:06.900> at<00:01:07.020> this<00:01:07.110> point

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
like so now i will say at this point

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.219 
like so now i will say at this point
that<00:01:07.950> because<00:01:08.670> once<00:01:08.939> you've<00:01:09.150> got<00:01:09.299> the<00:01:09.420> adapter

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
that because once you've got the adapter

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.620 
that because once you've got the adapter
inside<00:01:10.680> and<00:01:10.979> because<00:01:11.340> the<00:01:11.580> s4<00:01:11.939> cover<00:01:12.240> the

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
inside and because the s4 cover the

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.899 
inside and because the s4 cover the
original<00:01:13.049> one<00:01:13.229> is<00:01:13.680> pretty<00:01:14.130> form-fitted<00:01:14.760> that

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
original one is pretty form-fitted that

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.170 
original one is pretty form-fitted that
you<00:01:15.000> will<00:01:15.270> see<00:01:15.689> a<00:01:16.049> slight<00:01:16.830> bulge<00:01:17.189> now<00:01:17.790> if<00:01:17.939> you

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
you will see a slight bulge now if you

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.289 
you will see a slight bulge now if you
are<00:01:18.390> someone<00:01:18.869> who<00:01:18.900> has<00:01:19.020> a<00:01:20.090> form-fitted<00:01:21.090> case

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
are someone who has a form-fitted case

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.480 
are someone who has a form-fitted case
already<00:01:21.570> on<00:01:21.750> us<00:01:21.900> for<00:01:22.140> you<00:01:22.290> may<00:01:22.439> find<00:01:23.310> some
