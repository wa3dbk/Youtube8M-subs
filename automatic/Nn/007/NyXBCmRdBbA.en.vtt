00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:09.450
 'SÃ­ndic' 300 is a range phone 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:11.700
 low average but at a very low price 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.080
 accessible here in Mexico by the moment 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.230
 it's only available and it's that way 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:18.449
 movistar but fortunately here 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.730
 There is a new norm in Mexico 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:23.160
 allows the change of company's 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.710
 that we will note that the pieces 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:30.090
 the 'guaje' 60 and 300 that is for a 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:33.059
 very accessible amount of 1900 minutes to 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.880
 1800 depending on the company by 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:39.440
 example has one its screen so it 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:43.980
 this equipment the 4 inch screen 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:46.920
 correia android 4.1 living has a 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:49.739
 dual core processor that runs a 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.410
 trip is a 5 megapixel camera with 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:56.360
 flash 3 that's the horn 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:59.940
 a quick view of the equipment 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:03.780
 charger or the lumen the key to 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:05.430
 open it up voting is the general aspect of 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.370
 huawei 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:11.510
 we're going to open it, the rest is the interface 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:15.890
 from android 4 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:19.450
 have this menu can be modified 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:21.070
 fortunately we open 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:22.780
 what you have to say that exists and 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:26.189
 Huawei unlike everyone else 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:26.189
 that does not have a menu button 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:31.040
 on the menu button or techniques and the 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:34.070
 interface life in this sense of it 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:36.500
 as an iphone to legitimate it is that 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:38.840
 next allowed no button less 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:41.180
 simply to the set of folders by 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.100
 example are always an explanation 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:44.479
 then a moment to put on sale 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.460
 will mark the system can not 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:48.380
 delete or an application for example 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:49.670
 this what is it then eliminates it 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.979
 directly so you have to have 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:55.250
 careful in that sense one thing is a 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:59.630
 decreased aggressively that its doubled in dvd 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:01.700
 one giga hertz too day 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:04.100
 what surprises me a lot about this team 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:06.600
 more simply because company a letter 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:09.400
 also told them is that the screen 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.740
 word and second generation letters is 

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:14.110
 what surprised me 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:16.100
 dimas per company make up a lot of 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:20.660
 with the chamber d 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:22.940
 a camera front the camera as I am 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:25.040
 recording a table does not look good I'll say 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:28.990
 that I'm recording tablet but it's not 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:31.920
 influenced the excellent camera 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:31.920
 here we change 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:47.450
 how 

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:55.480
 unless it runs pretty well that 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:58.880
 lets run shandong with a game 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:00.530
 for high- end range phones 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:02.810
 medium-high they are receiving in the 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:05.090
 5000 this phone to the truth is very 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:07.760
 demanding and desisted because you're in 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:09.770
 half of the half and it runs exactly 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:13.370
 like all of yunnan elbow an application 

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:16.700
 that you simply go down 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:19.879
 that allows you to do what some for 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:24.650
 example the samsung galaxy s 3000 allows 

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:28.900
 You do commented that lets you see 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:28.900
 videos in other instances 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:36.250
 will allow you libido and be able to do 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:41.280
 other things and video I was stunned and 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:41.280
 like other things 

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:52.120
 I like it 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:55.110
 comment 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:01.620
 Japanese you can move this action 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:05.600
 is what the watÃ¡n allows in what 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:05.600
 allows the past dual-core 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:11.360
 a team pretty good for free 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:15.620
 company is the most surprising the team 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:17.630
 in another video are a review going well and 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:19.729
 how it should be simply by three 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:21.739
 they say to see that at the moment of 

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:25.360
 making your purchase is rather good 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:25.360
 buy this equipment 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:31.330
 a very complete and excellent king so that 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:34.590
 any color column we can 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:34.590
 make 10
