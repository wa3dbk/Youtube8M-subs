 a 1,700 milliamp battery 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.050
 We definitely are when a 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.970

 worth it and more for the price of 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:25.119
 this device the subject in which 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:26.680
 We have what you have in a design 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:28.210
 the different colors that are there 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.979
 that a little more than specifications that 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:32.619
 we just found them with the sensors 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:34.660
 50 remove appears the gravity from 

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:36.280
 distance and light and so on 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:38.740
 Ramon is the top and we 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:40.590
 directly with the phone we are going to 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:43.909
 put the phone aside and see more 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:46.780
 inside the box 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:46.780
 warranty 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:50.869
 quick guide we open the street and we 

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:52.760
 we only met with was doing 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:56.570
 headphones 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:58.810
 good charger usb microusb cable what 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:01.390
 it's still an adapter 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:03.579
 and this is the charger the truth is 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:06.189
 that we are going to open the charger because 

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:08.679
 it seems that only one unloads 

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:10.810
 fast your mobile we are going to talk about this 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:13.260
 here I will not have cable summers around here 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:15.610
 actor here we are going to open the hearing aids 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.360
 what is going to appear this is important 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:20.000
 stop 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:22.370
 some people the truth is that I feel 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.170
 I am forms of the economic however 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:26.210
 it's better this nothing true we're going to 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.890
 keep it inside the box and one is not 

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:30.860
 saved in the box let's see the 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:32.360
 device itself ok the device is 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.280
 pretty small we would tell what would 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:36.740
 being the shop brand for this part 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:39.140
 of the phone we have the flash in the 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:40.790
 2 megapixel main camera we have 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:42.470
 that the volume button and like that 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:44.540
 off button on the bottom 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:46.700
 we go with the home button I imagine that 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.230
 is the least and is to go back through 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.720
 the back are with a design of 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:52.310
 plastic with the brand shop or equally 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.660
 we go with the main camera of 5 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:55.489
 megapixels as with the flash 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:58.010
 now we return a little more of the design 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:03:00.170
 of the device is totally plastic 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:02.000
 I can see that we have the local yak 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:03.560
 just like apparently now we count 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.950
 only with greece in the microphone and the 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:08.540
 charging port if we open the phone 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:11.120
 we ran into the 1,700 battery 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:13.520
 miles periods as well as good and 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:15.140
 installed battery we are going to remove this 

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:17.560
 plastic to see if he learns the 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:17.560
 phone 

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:22.480
 no questions we have asked with the 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:25.030
 design the truth is that I like it 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:26.650
 a lot this is a light blue as well 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:28.600
 that the first one goes very well with the color 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:30.190
 silver that the silver tree is 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.590
 even if it's plastic it gives you this nice 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:34.300
 metallic finish and a base see if the 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:36.940
 device has batteries that the phone 

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:39.160
 If you have a battery, let's see what load 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:40.900
 the phone has already learned effectively 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:43.120
 I have a feeling to loli pop in this 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:45.310
 device with nothing else that follows if 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:46.930
 I am costa ramos of the channels of hd te 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:48.190
 I invite you to stay tuned to the channel 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:50.140
 because soon although the revised 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:51.210
 complete this device the link 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:53.080
 of purchase will be in the description 

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:55.510
 remember that this device was 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:56.740
 acquired in the 'top dotcom without anything 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:59.100
