00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.109
 natural 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.359
 I decided to put it because my fingernail 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:20.430
 too much is too weak and I eat 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:23.070
 very nail 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.970
 there he was hurting a lot aesthetically 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:29.070
 it was not beautiful but according to this 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:31.920
 dermatologist to cover up the defect is not 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:35.130
 a good alternative since the nails 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:37.110
 can hide others 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.870
 health problems 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.969
 always before adopting a method I'm going 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.440

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.300
 strong on the nose 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.579
 is to look for a dermatologist because 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.899
 weak nail brittle nail it can be 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:52.860
 including signs of systemic diseases 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:54.870
 like anemia thyroid changes then 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.640
 sometimes the person is no longer having the 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.410
 chance of an early diagnosis of a 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.960
 more effective treatment of a disease is 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.379
 systemic because it did not seek to defeat 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.680
 shopkeeper at the right time to avoid 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:07.020

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:10.100
 before you start to do the nails 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:13.590

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:19.470

 but there are also customers who want to have 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:25.080
 Beware of historical 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:28.739
 Ana Beatriz applies the gel nails there 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:33.690
 three years and praises the work is very 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:36.900
 durable, the enamel remains 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:40.140
 with the natural nail does not happen 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:42.989
 but even with all the care 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:46.410
 prolonged application of the technique may 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:48.750
 cause serious personal problems 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:51.510
 hand to a cabin with a bulbs in it. 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:53.880
 ultra violet for that substance if 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:57.269
 solidifies and gives the appearance of the nail person 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:59.040
 whether it is the ultraviolet is known 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:01.500
 great villain in early aging 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:03.480
 is a way to minimize this 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.730
 would not do the procedure with such 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.890
 frequency and use a sunscreen 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:11.730
 on the hands before going to that 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:14.609
 predisposition for medical guidance and 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:17.280
 radical these artificial nails they will 

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:20.579
 always cause minor or major damage 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:22.920
 degree and that's why we are ted 

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:24.570
 that the person use the nail in the natural way 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.459
 that I think the safest way to 

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:29.340
 take no chances, the ideal is that you 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:30.840
 take care of your natural nail and that it has 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:33.200
 the knowledge that you give of 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.200
 time
