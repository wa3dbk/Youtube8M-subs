00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.990
 hello and welcome to 

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:12.820
 Another video of me I am 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:16.590
 nexus and in this video I show you 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:16.590
 the handcuffs of nothing 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:19.939
 we'll be there the next 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:21.949
 handcuffs that have nothing energy 

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:25.789
 projection on it increases the grenades 

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:28.189
 Throw range of government decrease 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:31.570
 every time the grenades go off when 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:36.019
 you pick up a light ferry and scatter 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:38.540
 activates order for states and loads 

00:00:36.019 --> 00:00:40.190
 an extra tax had on the bottom 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:43.239
 actually means simply you get 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:45.170
 a second strew and the top one is 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:48.230
 that the litter mentioned goal 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:49.670
 suchfunktion trade with china short 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:51.289
 on the tax 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:54.199
 that would be run at each herein 

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:56.719
 sprinkle grenade one called the itself 

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:59.210
 divides into munitions and a big one 

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:00.770
 The area is full of explosions 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:02.840
 useful and if you still have to search 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:05.089
 are still much cooler but I show 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:06.830
 then in the cutouts here first 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:11.810
 still briefly the possibilities of combination 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:13.090
 with the teacher runner and the machine 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.289
 or the handcuffs 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:17.270
 the combination that i can do now 

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:18.039
 to do with all kinds of gears is very 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:20.660
 useful 

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:23.869
 the whole thing is based on this function 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:25.550
 energy deduction a powerful power 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:28.099
 Melee attack of falling energy 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:31.340
 withdraws and thus the cooldown of a 

00:01:28.099 --> 00:01:34.369
 grenade decreases when you with the 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:36.170
 hit somebody then you have for 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:38.599
 a short moment energy deduction on 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:40.340
 you and this ability is then active 

00:01:38.599 --> 00:01:42.830
 that the grenade charges faster 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.869
 sounds pretty good but now says manja 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:47.709
 Kuhl national fight is not so 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:51.319
 We can improve the whole thing 

00:01:47.709 --> 00:01:52.789
 by which they say come up sven 

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:54.830
 with energy deduction is eliminated 

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:56.780
 the cooldown of the nova decreases 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:58.729
 Bomb sounds a lot more enticing 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.560
 so grenade and nora bomb again 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:02.620
 We can still reduce that 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:06.010
 increase 

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:08.290
 in that that will be poor around the teaching 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:10.210
 take on a thrown nova 

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:12.820
 Bombs or grenades solve with their 

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:15.670
 harm a energy deduction effect 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:18.040
 that is if you are using the grenade 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:20.650
 someone hits gibson energy deduction 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:22.000
 Effect of energy deduction effect 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:26.730
 that the grenade it charges faster 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:30.460
 and super charging and faster 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:31.960
 In addition you can do the whole with the 

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:33.310
 Great also that means if in the 

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:35.500
 internet was someone kills there 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:37.270
 again energy lift effect on the 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:40.090
 Does not matter what ability you use 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:42.130
 blow grenade or super you have there 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:44.700
 always a bonus on it that I the nova 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:47.050
 and charge the grenades faster 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:50.050
 That's the combination with the games 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:51.700
 I like it then I have here for the grandfather 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:55.600
 wipe out the explosions of 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:58.120
 grenades and bombs are bigger 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:01.330
 effect is also more frequently used 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:02.890
 so that I can meet the enemy safely 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:04.600
 could also take the hunger with it 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:06.880
 energy deduction effect is longer in there 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:09.310
 It's up to you to decide how to do that 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:13.720
 management and now switch to the 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:15.430
 cutouts so first I show 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:17.590
 same time as the goal search 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:20.370
 works without slow motion you see the 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:24.220
 then follow easily 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:26.770
 and of course we have two edges which 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:28.690
 we were able to do it all the time 

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:30.340
 without a goal search I have now 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:33.100
 they have not equipped one yet 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:34.630
 sees the search no goal and thus the 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:36.150
 even more beautiful is in 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:39.220
 slow motion right away 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:41.110
 now you can see how the shots there 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:42.550
 are really aiming for and behind 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:46.750
 fly they do not have such a big one 

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:49.600
 radius but better than if you 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:52.600
 she plays without the search and indeed 

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:54.130
 much better for the pvp I consider 

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:55.959
 The gloves are not that good 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:57.850
 it's nice mentioned 2 1 while 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:59.980
 but there are better exotic ones 

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:02.140
 armor parts for this reason I show 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:03.190
 no excerpts from the pvp recommend 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:05.080
 not me 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:06.400
 I do not think that's good 

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:08.980
 play if you have nothing else two 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:11.080
 I call beautiful hand in all cases 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:12.790
 direction door and that was it 

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:14.320
 already from my video 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:15.850
 if you liked it, let it be 

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:17.470
 a like because i am looking forward to growing 

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:19.150
 or an abo if you do not know me yet 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:20.280
 I have subscribed to continue my studies 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:22.780
 whose upload the videos 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:25.110
 thank you for watching until last 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:25.110
 a video
