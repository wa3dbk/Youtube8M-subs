00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:30.880 
but what portable nakshatra is that now

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.240 
but what portable nakshatra is that now
that<00:02:31.150> everything<00:02:31.450> is<00:02:31.540> bulldozed<00:02:31.989> let's<00:02:32.890> build

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
that everything is bulldozed let's build

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:36.270 
that everything is bulldozed let's build
something<00:02:33.520> let's<00:02:33.850> create<00:02:34.120> something<00:02:35.280> and

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
something let's create something and

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.880 
something let's create something and
this<00:02:37.180> is<00:02:37.360> a<00:02:37.390> very<00:02:37.660> creative<00:02:38.170> nakshatra<00:02:38.769> as

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
this is a very creative nakshatra as

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:40.830 
this is a very creative nakshatra as
well<00:02:39.069> because<00:02:39.400> here<00:02:39.610> Jupiter<00:02:40.180> brings<00:02:40.569> in

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
well because here Jupiter brings in

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.220 
well because here Jupiter brings in
divine<00:02:41.739> intelligence<00:02:42.220> of<00:02:42.730> the<00:02:43.180> gods<00:02:43.360> how<00:02:44.170> to

00:02:57.059 --> 00:02:57.069 
third part of this nakshatra these guys

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:00.539 
third part of this nakshatra these guys
kind<00:02:57.880> of<00:02:58.030> literally<00:02:58.630> become<00:02:59.019> the<00:02:59.170> true<00:02:59.620> Gemini

00:03:00.539 --> 00:03:00.549 
kind of literally become the true Gemini

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:05.190 
kind of literally become the true Gemini
people<00:03:02.310> they<00:03:03.310> are<00:03:03.580> the<00:03:04.000> ones<00:03:04.330> who<00:03:04.720> have<00:03:04.989> the

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
entrepreneurial nature to create many

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.100 
entrepreneurial nature to create many
different<00:03:08.739> things<00:03:09.190> at<00:03:09.370> the<00:03:09.400> same<00:03:09.580> time<00:03:10.110> they

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:11.110 
different things at the same time they

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:14.460 
different things at the same time they

Elon Musk is if they want to learn about

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.860 
Elon Musk is if they want to learn about
math<00:03:26.890> they<00:03:27.430> want<00:03:27.670> to<00:03:27.760> learn<00:03:27.910> Barre<00:03:28.150> universe

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
math they want to learn Barre universe

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:35.270 
math they want to learn Barre universe
and<00:03:29.220> planets<00:03:30.220> and<00:03:31.680> automobile<00:03:33.299> sports

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280

just know about everything and somehow
create<00:03:42.130> try<00:03:42.370> to<00:03:42.430> create<00:03:42.730> something<00:03:43.150> new<00:03:43.269> in

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:43.420 
create try to create something new in

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:45.840 
create try to create something new in
all<00:03:43.540> these<00:03:43.810> things<00:03:44.079> so<00:03:44.709> I<00:03:44.739> knew<00:03:45.070> a<00:03:45.100> very

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:45.850 
all these things so I knew a very

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:47.910 
all these things so I knew a very
entrepreneurial<00:03:46.540> natured<00:03:47.200> person<00:03:47.590> is<00:03:47.709> born

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:47.920 
entrepreneurial natured person is born

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:50.610 
entrepreneurial natured person is born
and<00:03:48.100> there's<00:03:48.280> this<00:03:48.430> thing<00:03:48.670> and<00:03:49.590> because<00:03:50.590> of

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:50.620 
and there's this thing and because of

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:52.590 
and there's this thing and because of
the<00:03:50.859> backing<00:03:51.280> of<00:03:51.400> Jupiter<00:03:51.910> because<00:03:52.150> this<00:03:52.480> is

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:52.600 
the backing of Jupiter because this is

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:55.740 
the backing of Jupiter because this is
the<00:03:52.750> sign<00:03:53.079> controlled<00:03:53.500> by<00:03:53.650> Jupiter<00:03:54.750> shows

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:55.750 
the sign controlled by Jupiter shows

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:58.500 
the sign controlled by Jupiter shows
that<00:03:55.930> that<00:03:56.079> one's<00:03:56.319> has<00:03:56.620> the<00:03:56.859> intelligence<00:03:57.510> to

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:58.510 
that that one's has the intelligence to

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:01.349 
that that one's has the intelligence to
implement<00:03:59.230> those<00:03:59.410> ideas<00:03:59.650> and<00:04:00.220> make<00:04:01.120> them

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:01.359 
implement those ideas and make them

00:04:01.359 --> 00:04:03.150 
implement those ideas and make them
something<00:04:01.690> in<00:04:01.930> a<00:04:01.989> very<00:04:02.109> useful<00:04:02.410> manner<00:04:02.859> and

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:03.160 
something in a very useful manner and

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:06.330 
something in a very useful manner and
you<00:04:04.060> will<00:04:04.180> find<00:04:04.510> a<00:04:04.780> lot<00:04:05.410> of<00:04:05.440> people<00:04:06.040> with<00:04:06.220> this

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:06.340 
you will find a lot of people with this

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:13.110 
you will find a lot of people with this
kind<00:04:06.730> of<00:04:06.819> a<00:04:07.170> Baha<00:04:08.760> going<00:04:09.760> into<00:04:10.440> robotics<00:04:12.120> Kriya

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:13.120 
kind of a Baha going into robotics Kriya

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:16.469 
kind of a Baha going into robotics Kriya
engineering<00:04:14.250> creating<00:04:15.250> something<00:04:15.519> new<00:04:15.730> that

00:04:16.469 --> 00:04:16.479 
engineering creating something new that

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:18.830 
engineering creating something new that
is<00:04:16.510> hot<00:04:17.019> that<00:04:17.049> requires<00:04:17.680> higher<00:04:18.010> education

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840 
is hot that requires higher education

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:21.870 
is hot that requires higher education
even<00:04:19.840> though<00:04:20.019> Mars<00:04:20.890> is<00:04:21.099> not<00:04:21.250> involved<00:04:21.549> you

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:21.880 
even though Mars is not involved you

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:23.520 
even though Mars is not involved you
know<00:04:22.030> nothing<00:04:22.419> is<00:04:22.539> involved<00:04:22.900> but<00:04:22.990> remember

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:23.530 
know nothing is involved but remember

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:25.659 
know nothing is involved but remember
Jupiter<00:04:24.010> is<00:04:24.070> higher<00:04:24.340> education

00:04:25.659 --> 00:04:25.669 
Jupiter is higher education

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:28.820 
Jupiter is higher education
education<00:04:26.669> like<00:04:27.360> PhD<00:04:27.990> master's<00:04:28.560> degree

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:28.830 
education like PhD master's degree

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:30.800 
education like PhD master's degree
doctor<00:04:29.310> degree<00:04:29.639> so<00:04:30.210> these<00:04:30.419> are<00:04:30.570> the<00:04:30.660> people
