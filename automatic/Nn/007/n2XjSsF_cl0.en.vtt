other players on the other hand tend to
perform<00:00:34.290> much<00:00:34.739> better<00:00:34.980> in<00:00:35.219> practice<00:00:35.460> when

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
perform much better in practice when

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.660 
perform much better in practice when
there's<00:00:36.270> very<00:00:36.570> little<00:00:36.840> pressure<00:00:37.460> so<00:00:38.460> what's

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
there's very little pressure so what's

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.700 
there's very little pressure so what's
the<00:00:38.850> difference<00:00:39.000> and<00:00:39.480> how<00:00:39.930> can<00:00:39.989> you<00:00:40.200> become

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
the difference and how can you become

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.139 
the difference and how can you become
one<00:00:40.860> of<00:00:40.980> those<00:00:41.100> clutch<00:00:41.399> players<00:00:41.730> that

winning those important matches under

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.840 
winning those important matches under
pressure<00:00:51.530> the<00:00:52.530> first<00:00:52.860> problem<00:00:53.190> we<00:00:53.309> face<00:00:53.579> is

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
pressure the first problem we face is

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.150 
pressure the first problem we face is
that<00:00:53.879> we're<00:00:54.120> so<00:00:54.360> focused<00:00:54.690> on<00:00:55.079> winning<00:00:55.530> that<00:00:55.980> we

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
that we're so focused on winning that we

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.819 
that we're so focused on winning that we
can<00:00:56.430> remain<00:00:56.789> calm<00:00:57.210> and<00:00:57.480> focus<00:00:58.199> just<00:00:58.440> on<00:00:58.649> the

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
can remain calm and focus just on the

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.770 
can remain calm and focus just on the
process<00:00:59.309> of<00:00:59.430> playing<00:00:59.699> one<00:01:00.030> point<00:01:00.359> at<00:01:00.600> a<00:01:00.629> time

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
process of playing one point at a time

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.830 
process of playing one point at a time
if<00:01:01.260> we<00:01:02.129> were<00:01:02.280> able<00:01:02.460> to<00:01:02.760> focus<00:01:03.000> only<00:01:03.329> on<00:01:03.510> one

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
if we were able to focus only on one

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.140 
if we were able to focus only on one
point<00:01:04.080> at<00:01:04.290> a<00:01:04.350> time<00:01:04.409> and<00:01:04.890> the<00:01:05.250> process<00:01:05.760> of<00:01:05.909> how

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
point at a time and the process of how

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.179 
point at a time and the process of how
we<00:01:06.180> want<00:01:06.630> to<00:01:06.689> play<00:01:07.020> that<00:01:07.049> point<00:01:07.560> we<00:01:08.010> would<00:01:08.130> have

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
we want to play that point we would have

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.609 
we want to play that point we would have
the<00:01:08.490> best<00:01:08.729> possible<00:01:09.210> chance<00:01:09.570> of<00:01:09.720> winning<00:01:10.500> the

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
the best possible chance of winning the

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.399 
the best possible chance of winning the
match<00:01:10.970> instead<00:01:11.970> we<00:01:12.150> think<00:01:12.360> about<00:01:12.540> things<00:01:13.229> like

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
match instead we think about things like

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.770 
match instead we think about things like
the<00:01:13.680> consequences<00:01:14.130> winning<00:01:14.939> or<00:01:15.090> losing<00:01:15.420> will

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
the consequences winning or losing will

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.870 
the consequences winning or losing will
have<00:01:16.020> for<00:01:16.290> us<00:01:16.409> and<00:01:16.680> then<00:01:17.369> we<00:01:17.520> start<00:01:17.790> to

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
have for us and then we start to

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.719 
have for us and then we start to
overthink<00:01:18.509> things<00:01:18.869> in<00:01:19.080> general<00:01:19.350> we<00:01:20.250> get<00:01:20.460> more

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
overthink things in general we get more

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.969 
overthink things in general we get more
and<00:01:20.880> more<00:01:20.939> nervous<00:01:21.270> and<00:01:21.689> oftentimes<00:01:22.500> this

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
and more nervous and oftentimes this

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.670 
and more nervous and oftentimes this
ends<00:01:23.369> up<00:01:23.460> with<00:01:23.640> us<00:01:23.820> being<00:01:24.119> very<00:01:24.210> upset<00:01:24.720> and<00:01:25.229> we

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
ends up with us being very upset and we

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.830 
ends up with us being very upset and we
can't<00:01:25.979> focus<00:01:26.280> on<00:01:26.549> the<00:01:26.610> process<00:01:26.939> anymore<00:01:27.659> at

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
can't focus on the process anymore at

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.179 
can't focus on the process anymore at
all<00:01:28.049> which<00:01:28.650> becomes<00:01:29.070> a<00:01:29.250> real<00:01:29.490> downward<00:01:30.119> spiral

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:31.189 
all which becomes a real downward spiral

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:34.280 
all which becomes a real downward spiral
so<00:01:32.189> we<00:01:32.400> know<00:01:32.610> that<00:01:32.939> the<00:01:33.119> key<00:01:33.390> is<00:01:33.570> to<00:01:33.840> focus

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
so we know that the key is to focus

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.350 
so we know that the key is to focus
solely<00:01:34.680> on<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:35.100> process<00:01:35.610> of<00:01:35.759> playing<00:01:36.030> one

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
solely on the process of playing one

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.350 
solely on the process of playing one
point<00:01:36.720> at<00:01:36.990> a<00:01:37.020> time<00:01:37.430> but<00:01:38.430> how<00:01:38.640> can<00:01:38.700> you<00:01:38.880> get<00:01:39.150> out

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
point at a time but how can you get out

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.450 
point at a time but how can you get out
of<00:01:39.450> that<00:01:39.630> negative<00:01:40.229> spiral<00:01:40.619> so<00:01:40.979> that<00:01:41.130> you<00:01:41.280> can

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
of that negative spiral so that you can

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.330 
of that negative spiral so that you can
focus<00:01:41.700> on<00:01:42.030> the<00:01:42.360> process<00:01:42.600> again<00:01:43.340> there's

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
focus on the process again there's

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.490 
focus on the process again there's
actually<00:01:44.880> one<00:01:45.149> extremely<00:01:45.810> effective

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
actually one extremely effective

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.740 
actually one extremely effective
exercise<00:01:47.040> that<00:01:47.520> have<00:01:47.670> used<00:01:47.850> a<00:01:48.030> lot<00:01:48.240> in<00:01:48.509> recent

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
exercise that have used a lot in recent

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.780 
exercise that have used a lot in recent
years<00:01:49.140> with<00:01:49.409> students<00:01:50.070> that<00:01:50.460> can<00:01:50.610> change

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
years with students that can change

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.660 
years with students that can change
everything<00:01:51.329> for<00:01:51.750> you<00:01:51.899> so<00:01:52.520> what's<00:01:53.520> the

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.880 
everything for you so what's the
exercise<00:01:54.180> I<00:01:54.509> want<00:01:55.079> you<00:01:55.259> to<00:01:55.439> challenge

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
exercise I want you to challenge

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.219 
exercise I want you to challenge
yourself<00:01:56.340> to<00:01:56.399> play<00:01:56.640> one<00:01:57.030> entire<00:01:57.420> set<00:01:57.750> where

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
yourself to play one entire set where

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.980 
yourself to play one entire set where
you<00:01:58.259> follow<00:01:58.680> the<00:01:58.950> same<00:01:59.280> routine<00:01:59.759> after<00:02:00.570> every

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
you follow the same routine after every

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.620 
you follow the same routine after every
point<00:02:01.320> so<00:02:02.280> if<00:02:02.399> you<00:02:02.520> win<00:02:02.729> a<00:02:02.759> point<00:02:03.119> you<00:02:03.360> turn

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
point so if you win a point you turn

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.990 
point so if you win a point you turn
around<00:02:03.869> you<00:02:04.530> go<00:02:04.770> to<00:02:04.829> your<00:02:05.070> strengths<00:02:05.549> you<00:02:05.700> take

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
around you go to your strengths you take

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:06.800 
around you go to your strengths you take
a<00:02:06.030> deep<00:02:06.299> breath

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
a deep breath

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.960 
a deep breath
or<00:02:07.079> follow<00:02:07.500> whatever<00:02:07.979> your<00:02:08.369> individual

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
or follow whatever your individual

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.410 
or follow whatever your individual
routine<00:02:09.420> is<00:02:09.629> and<00:02:09.899> if<00:02:10.410> you<00:02:10.560> lose<00:02:10.830> a<00:02:10.860> point

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
routine is and if you lose a point

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.520 
routine is and if you lose a point
especially<00:02:12.420> when<00:02:12.599> you<00:02:12.690> commit<00:02:13.020> it<00:02:13.140> and

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
especially when you commit it and

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.040 
especially when you commit it and
the<00:02:13.680> unforced<00:02:14.220> error<00:02:14.430> you<00:02:14.940> follow<00:02:15.270> the<00:02:15.480> exact

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
the unforced error you follow the exact

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:17.240 
the unforced error you follow the exact
same<00:02:16.440> routine

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
same routine

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.880 
same routine
sounds<00:02:18.120> easy<00:02:18.240> I<00:02:18.660> can<00:02:19.110> tell<00:02:19.290> you<00:02:19.470> that<00:02:19.620> this<00:02:19.710> is

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
sounds easy I can tell you that this is

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.390 
sounds easy I can tell you that this is
a<00:02:19.920> lot<00:02:20.310> harder<00:02:20.610> than<00:02:20.850> it<00:02:21.060> sounds<00:02:21.630> if<00:02:22.220> you<00:02:23.220> do

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
a lot harder than it sounds if you do

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.370 
a lot harder than it sounds if you do
this<00:02:23.580> right<00:02:23.910> somebody<00:02:24.540> watching<00:02:25.050> from<00:02:25.260> the

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
this right somebody watching from the

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:28.010 
this right somebody watching from the
outside<00:02:25.410> is<00:02:26.190> not<00:02:26.760> able<00:02:27.090> to<00:02:27.330> tell<00:02:27.570> whether<00:02:27.870> or

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
outside is not able to tell whether or

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.650 
outside is not able to tell whether or
not<00:02:28.170> you<00:02:28.530> want<00:02:28.890> or<00:02:29.130> lost<00:02:29.520> the<00:02:29.880> previous<00:02:30.120> point

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
not you want or lost the previous point

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.500 
not you want or lost the previous point
we're<00:02:31.590> all<00:02:31.770> conditioned<00:02:32.370> to<00:02:32.700> display<00:02:33.330> at

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
we're all conditioned to display at

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.690 
we're all conditioned to display at
least<00:02:33.840> a<00:02:34.140> little<00:02:34.530> bit<00:02:34.680> of<00:02:34.800> negative<00:02:35.400> body

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
least a little bit of negative body

least a little bit of negative body
language<00:02:35.850> after<00:02:36.450> committing<00:02:37.230> easy<00:02:37.590> unforced

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
language after committing easy unforced

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.670 
language after committing easy unforced
errors<00:02:38.760> so<00:02:39.360> trust<00:02:39.690> me<00:02:39.810> this<00:02:40.110> is<00:02:40.260> a<00:02:40.380> real

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
errors so trust me this is a real

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.640 
errors so trust me this is a real
challenge<00:02:41.600> so<00:02:42.600> why<00:02:42.810> would<00:02:43.050> we<00:02:43.230> want<00:02:43.260> to<00:02:43.530> do

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
challenge so why would we want to do

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.000 
challenge so why would we want to do
this<00:02:43.830> and<00:02:44.100> why<00:02:44.640> does<00:02:44.880> it<00:02:45.000> help<00:02:45.180> you<00:02:45.360> so<00:02:45.660> much

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
this and why does it help you so much

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.860 
this and why does it help you so much
studies<00:02:47.010> have<00:02:47.040> shown<00:02:47.220> that<00:02:47.520> anger<00:02:48.510> levels

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
studies have shown that anger levels

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:50.870 
studies have shown that anger levels
don't<00:02:49.110> go<00:02:49.350> down<00:02:49.590> quick<00:02:50.010> enough<00:02:50.040> after<00:02:50.790> an

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
don't go down quick enough after an

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.970 
don't go down quick enough after an
outburst<00:02:51.360> so<00:02:51.959> that<00:02:52.110> it<00:02:52.200> wouldn't<00:02:52.470> influence

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
outburst so that it wouldn't influence

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.880 
outburst so that it wouldn't influence
the<00:02:53.400> next<00:02:53.760> point<00:02:54.060> so<00:02:54.300> if<00:02:54.900> we<00:02:55.050> display<00:02:55.470> negative

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
the next point so if we display negative

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:58.010 
the next point so if we display negative
body<00:02:56.130> language<00:02:56.280> for<00:02:56.790> example<00:02:57.239> or<00:02:57.390> we<00:02:57.540> comment

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:58.020 
body language for example or we comment

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:00.290 
body language for example or we comment
on<00:02:58.170> our<00:02:58.230> errors<00:02:58.830> we<00:02:59.340> actually<00:02:59.730> put<00:02:59.970> more

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:00.300 
on our errors we actually put more

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:03.350 
on our errors we actually put more
energy<00:03:00.480> into<00:03:01.170> that<00:03:01.320> negative<00:03:01.650> spiral<00:03:02.520> the

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
energy into that negative spiral the

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.479 
energy into that negative spiral the
great<00:03:03.600> news<00:03:03.870> however<00:03:04.140> is<00:03:04.380> if<00:03:04.800> we<00:03:04.980> don't<00:03:05.280> do

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
great news however is if we don't do

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:08.390 
great news however is if we don't do
that<00:03:05.700> and<00:03:05.970> if<00:03:06.630> we<00:03:06.840> follow<00:03:07.170> our<00:03:07.260> routine<00:03:07.860> after

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
that and if we follow our routine after

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.180 
that and if we follow our routine after
every<00:03:08.820> point<00:03:09.120> we<00:03:09.660> become<00:03:10.020> calmer<00:03:10.620> and<00:03:10.800> calmer

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
every point we become calmer and calmer

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.970 
every point we become calmer and calmer
and<00:03:11.580> can<00:03:12.120> focus<00:03:12.330> on<00:03:12.660> the<00:03:12.780> process<00:03:13.020> again<00:03:13.560> so

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
and can focus on the process again so

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:15.830 
and can focus on the process again so
essentially<00:03:14.580> we're<00:03:15.000> now<00:03:15.180> putting<00:03:15.540> energy

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
essentially we're now putting energy

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.370 
essentially we're now putting energy
into<00:03:16.410> a<00:03:16.440> positive<00:03:17.160> spiral<00:03:17.900> you've<00:03:18.900> all<00:03:19.170> heard

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
into a positive spiral you've all heard

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.500 
into a positive spiral you've all heard
a<00:03:19.530> lot<00:03:19.560> about<00:03:20.040> what<00:03:20.310> you<00:03:20.430> can<00:03:20.640> do<00:03:20.880> when<00:03:21.360> you're

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
a lot about what you can do when you're

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:23.360 
a lot about what you can do when you're
angry<00:03:21.930> on<00:03:22.049> the<00:03:22.170> court<00:03:22.440> so<00:03:22.620> that<00:03:22.769> you<00:03:22.890> can<00:03:23.040> focus

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
angry on the court so that you can focus

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:26.449 
angry on the court so that you can focus
on<00:03:23.700> the<00:03:24.030> process<00:03:24.540> again<00:03:24.769> now<00:03:25.769> I<00:03:25.830> can<00:03:26.100> tell<00:03:26.310> you

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
on the process again now I can tell you

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:28.070 
on the process again now I can tell you
that<00:03:26.580> this<00:03:26.730> is<00:03:26.880> by<00:03:27.030> far<00:03:27.269> the<00:03:27.330> most<00:03:27.690> effective

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:28.080 
that this is by far the most effective

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:30.650 
that this is by far the most effective
strategy<00:03:28.739> I<00:03:28.769> came<00:03:29.220> across<00:03:29.370> in<00:03:29.820> many<00:03:30.120> years<00:03:30.390> of

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
strategy I came across in many years of

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:31.640 
strategy I came across in many years of
experimentation

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
experimentation

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:34.699 
experimentation
what<00:03:32.489> I<00:03:32.519> find<00:03:32.850> again<00:03:33.390> and<00:03:33.690> again<00:03:34.049> when<00:03:34.560> I<00:03:34.590> do

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
what I find again and again when I do

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:36.800 
what I find again and again when I do
this<00:03:34.950> with<00:03:35.190> students<00:03:35.790> is<00:03:35.910> that<00:03:36.390> they<00:03:36.540> play

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
this with students is that they play

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:38.870 
this with students is that they play
better<00:03:37.110> the<00:03:37.530> longer<00:03:37.739> the<00:03:38.130> match<00:03:38.340> goes<00:03:38.670> on

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:38.880 
better the longer the match goes on

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:41.210 
better the longer the match goes on
because<00:03:39.570> they<00:03:39.720> become<00:03:40.049> calmer<00:03:40.380> and<00:03:40.769> they<00:03:41.070> can

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
because they become calmer and they can

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:44.330 
because they become calmer and they can
focus<00:03:41.519> on<00:03:41.880> the<00:03:42.180> process<00:03:42.420> again<00:03:43.010> so<00:03:44.010> go<00:03:44.220> ahead

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
focus on the process again so go ahead

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.880 
focus on the process again so go ahead
and<00:03:44.489> set<00:03:44.940> yourself<00:03:45.390> this<00:03:45.600> challenge<00:03:46.110> play<00:03:46.590> one

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:46.890 
and set yourself this challenge play one
