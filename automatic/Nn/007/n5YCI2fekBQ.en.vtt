so<00:03:00.269> what<00:03:00.989> to<00:03:01.139> look<00:03:01.290> for<00:03:01.620> in<00:03:01.889> a<00:03:02.100> good<00:03:02.250> shovel

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
so what to look for in a good shovel

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:09.530 
so what to look for in a good shovel
well<00:03:03.600> first<00:03:04.530> off<00:03:05.180> an<00:03:06.180> extendable<00:03:08.239> handle<00:03:09.239> is

well first off an extendable handle is

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:12.020 
well first off an extendable handle is
very<00:03:09.690> important<00:03:10.500> this<00:03:11.250> gives<00:03:11.489> you<00:03:11.579> extra

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
very important this gives you extra

reach and allows you to move snow much
more<00:03:15.359> efficiently<00:03:16.880> there's<00:03:17.880> a<00:03:17.970> real<00:03:18.150> knack<00:03:18.540> to

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:19.139 
more efficiently there's a real knack to

00:03:19.139 --> 00:03:22.190 
more efficiently there's a real knack to
moving<00:03:19.560> soft<00:03:20.040> snow<00:03:20.400> quickly<00:03:21.090> it's<00:03:21.900> less

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
moving soft snow quickly it's less

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:44.390 
moving soft snow quickly it's less
digging<00:03:22.799> and<00:03:23.010> more<00:03:23.430> scooping

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:49.229 

as<00:03:45.750> you<00:03:46.750> can<00:03:46.930> see<00:03:47.200> with<00:03:47.650> a<00:03:47.680> long<00:03:47.980> handle<00:03:48.250> that

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:49.239 
as you can see with a long handle that

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:52.410 
as you can see with a long handle that
scooping<00:03:49.870> motion<00:03:50.049> is<00:03:50.830> made<00:03:51.190> much<00:03:51.549> easier<00:03:52.000> and

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:52.420 
scooping motion is made much easier and

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:55.470 
scooping motion is made much easier and
it's<00:03:53.200> also<00:03:53.409> much<00:03:53.799> easier<00:03:54.190> on<00:03:54.250> your<00:03:54.430> back<00:03:54.640> what

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:55.480 
it's also much easier on your back what

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.270 
it's also much easier on your back what

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:57.280 
else do I look for in a good shovel

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:00.210 
else do I look for in a good shovel
well<00:03:57.580> first<00:03:57.879> off<00:03:58.060> a<00:03:58.360> good<00:03:58.690> strong<00:03:59.170> metal<00:03:59.769> blade

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:00.220 
well first off a good strong metal blade

well first off a good strong metal blade
that's<00:04:01.030> going<00:04:01.299> to<00:04:01.360> last<00:04:01.540> you<00:04:01.750> a<00:04:01.780> lot<00:04:01.959> longer

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
that's going to last you a lot longer

that's going to last you a lot longer
plastic<00:04:03.430> blades<00:04:03.670> may<00:04:04.000> be<00:04:04.060> lighter<00:04:04.450> but<00:04:05.319> in

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:05.500 
plastic blades may be lighter but in

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:07.770 
plastic blades may be lighter but in
cold<00:04:05.799> conditions<00:04:06.430> they<00:04:06.970> become<00:04:07.329> more<00:04:07.510> brittle

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:07.780 
cold conditions they become more brittle

cold conditions they become more brittle
and<00:04:08.200> I've<00:04:08.560> seen<00:04:08.799> quite<00:04:09.010> a<00:04:09.129> few<00:04:09.250> plastic<00:04:10.090> shovel

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:10.780 
and I've seen quite a few plastic shovel

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:12.890 
and I've seen quite a few plastic shovel
blades<00:04:11.019> break<00:04:11.379> over<00:04:11.950> the<00:04:11.980> years

it'd be shaped handle if possible these
are<00:04:20.109> becoming<00:04:20.380> harder<00:04:20.799> to<00:04:20.949> find<00:04:21.250> these<00:04:21.549> days

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:21.910 
are becoming harder to find these days

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:24.840 
are becoming harder to find these days
you<00:04:22.449> see<00:04:22.630> a<00:04:22.660> lot<00:04:22.870> with<00:04:23.050> a<00:04:23.080> T<00:04:23.380> grip<00:04:23.680> but<00:04:24.190> a<00:04:24.220> D<00:04:24.520> grip

you see a lot with a T grip but a D grip

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:26.580 
you see a lot with a T grip but a D grip
is<00:04:25.060> really<00:04:25.479> good<00:04:25.660> because<00:04:25.810> you<00:04:25.990> can<00:04:26.139> use<00:04:26.440> them

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:26.590 
is really good because you can use them

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:29.010 
is really good because you can use them
not<00:04:26.770> just<00:04:26.830> with<00:04:27.220> gloves<00:04:27.550> but<00:04:28.120> also<00:04:28.300> with

00:04:35.189 --> 00:04:35.199 
for in any snow shovel is a removable

00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:37.770 
for in any snow shovel is a removable
head<00:04:35.590> so<00:04:35.860> that<00:04:35.889> you<00:04:36.010> can<00:04:36.190> separate<00:04:36.639> the<00:04:36.940> handle

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:37.780 
head so that you can separate the handle

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:42.090 
head so that you can separate the handle
and<00:04:37.900> shaft<00:04:38.199> from<00:04:38.770> the<00:04:39.370> head<00:04:40.050> like<00:04:41.050> so<00:04:41.380> that

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:42.100 
and shaft from the head like so that

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:44.250 
and shaft from the head like so that

things<00:04:50.260> much<00:04:50.440> easier<00:04:50.919> so<00:04:51.550> that's<00:04:51.669> something

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:52.090 
things much easier so that's something

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:59.640 
things much easier so that's something

customization on your part think about

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:08.279 
customization on your part think about
