00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:05.430 
today we're going to present you watch

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:07.909 
today we're going to present you watch
by<00:00:05.790> Piaget<00:00:06.180> that<00:00:06.569> was<00:00:06.750> first<00:00:07.049> introduced<00:00:07.560> at

00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:07.919 
by Piaget that was first introduced at

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:09.799 
by Piaget that was first introduced at
the<00:00:08.130> SHA<00:00:08.670> 2011

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
the SHA 2011

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.430 
the SHA 2011
it's<00:00:10.380> the<00:00:10.590> otaku<00:00:11.550> some<00:00:11.820> automatic<00:00:12.719> jovial

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
it's the otaku some automatic jovial

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.129 
it's the otaku some automatic jovial
it's<00:00:13.950> the<00:00:14.250> thinnest<00:00:14.759> tobe<00:00:15.389> own<00:00:15.540> in<00:00:15.809> the<00:00:15.929> world

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
it's the thinnest tobe own in the world

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.170 
it's the thinnest tobe own in the world
it's<00:00:16.590> only<00:00:16.830> five<00:00:17.699> point<00:00:17.970> five<00:00:18.119> millimeter

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
it's only five point five millimeter

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.980 
it's only five point five millimeter
thick<00:00:19.050> the<00:00:19.470> entire<00:00:19.890> case<00:00:20.490> is<00:00:20.910> just<00:00:21.420> above<00:00:21.630> ten

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
thick the entire case is just above ten

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.320 
thick the entire case is just above ten
millimeter<00:00:22.590> so<00:00:22.890> it's<00:00:23.039> a<00:00:23.189> very<00:00:23.369> thin<00:00:23.730> watch<00:00:23.939> and

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
millimeter so it's a very thin watch and

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.240 
millimeter so it's a very thin watch and
we<00:00:24.600> know<00:00:24.720> Piaget<00:00:25.109> being<00:00:25.350> really<00:00:25.680> expert<00:00:26.039> at

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
we know Piaget being really expert at

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.880 
we know Piaget being really expert at
doing<00:00:26.369> ultra-thin<00:00:27.240> movements<00:00:27.810> it<00:00:28.230> comes<00:00:28.710> from

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
doing ultra-thin movements it comes from

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.130 
doing ultra-thin movements it comes from
the<00:00:29.130> black<00:00:29.400> tie<00:00:29.640> family<00:00:30.090> of<00:00:30.269> watches<00:00:30.840> meaning

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
the black tie family of watches meaning

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.749 
the black tie family of watches meaning
that<00:00:31.260> it<00:00:31.410> generally<00:00:31.710> have<00:00:31.890> a<00:00:32.099> shape<00:00:32.489> within

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
that it generally have a shape within

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.190 
that it generally have a shape within
the<00:00:32.969> shape<00:00:33.180> and<00:00:33.390> here<00:00:33.570> you<00:00:33.690> see<00:00:33.870> it<00:00:33.899> really

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
the shape and here you see it really

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.440 
the shape and here you see it really
well<00:00:34.380> with<00:00:34.620> the<00:00:34.710> concern<00:00:35.070> shape<00:00:35.309> that<00:00:36.180> first

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
well with the concern shape that first

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.830 
well with the concern shape that first
came<00:00:36.630> out<00:00:36.750> in<00:00:37.020> the<00:00:37.200> mid<00:00:37.649> 90s<00:00:38.300> with<00:00:39.300> for<00:00:39.780> the

kind of linked and you can really see an

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.440 
kind of linked and you can really see an
eight-figure<00:01:14.100> when<00:01:14.400> it<00:01:14.490> came<00:01:14.670> out<00:01:14.820> it<00:01:15.210> really

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
eight-figure when it came out it really

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.780 
eight-figure when it came out it really
kind<00:01:15.780> of<00:01:15.900> struck<00:01:16.200> everybody<00:01:16.700> having<00:01:17.700> this

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
kind of struck everybody having this

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.149 
kind of struck everybody having this
really<00:01:18.090> original<00:01:18.720> aspect<00:01:19.470> there<00:01:20.040> are

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
really original aspect there are

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.460 
really original aspect there are
approximately<00:01:20.820> 200<00:01:21.270> components<00:01:21.840> in<00:01:22.080> this

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
approximately 200 components in this

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.320 
approximately 200 components in this
movement<00:01:22.890> and<00:01:23.070> you<00:01:23.430> can<00:01:23.580> actually<00:01:23.729> see<00:01:24.119> them

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
movement and you can actually see them

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.480 
movement and you can actually see them
through<00:01:24.750> this<00:01:24.990> sapphire<00:01:25.680> glass<00:01:25.890> the<00:01:26.159> second

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
through this sapphire glass the second

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.280 
through this sapphire glass the second
layer<00:01:26.610> of<00:01:26.729> sapphire<00:01:27.150> glass<00:01:27.330> because<00:01:28.049> on<00:01:28.200> the

layer of sapphire glass because on the
back<00:01:28.380> of<00:01:28.560> the<00:01:28.650> case<00:01:28.890> the<00:01:29.220> only<00:01:29.430> two<00:01:30.409> openings

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
back of the case the only two openings

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.350 
back of the case the only two openings
are<00:01:31.680> for<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:32.159> casual<00:01:32.820> beyond<00:01:33.060> that<00:01:33.240> you<00:01:33.329> can

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
are for the casual beyond that you can

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.850 
are for the casual beyond that you can
see<00:01:33.570> here<00:01:33.869> and<00:01:34.049> the<00:01:34.140> power<00:01:34.290> reserve<00:01:34.710> indicator

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
see here and the power reserve indicator

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.539 
see here and the power reserve indicator
and<00:01:35.460> this<00:01:36.270> movement<00:01:36.540> is<00:01:36.990> a<00:01:37.049> mix<00:01:37.500> between<00:01:37.799> two

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
and this movement is a mix between two

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.999 
and this movement is a mix between two
existing<00:01:39.180> previous<00:01:39.570> movements<00:01:39.960> from<00:01:40.079> Piaget

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
existing previous movements from Piaget

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:46.160 
existing previous movements from Piaget
is<00:01:41.220> the<00:01:41.820> 600<00:01:42.450> P<00:01:42.780> and<00:01:43.790> 1208<00:01:44.790> one<00:01:45.390> had<00:01:45.630> the<00:01:45.840> micro

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
is the 600 P and 1208 one had the micro

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:46.670 
is the 600 P and 1208 one had the micro
toe

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
toe

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.980 
toe
the<00:01:46.950> other<00:01:47.070> one<00:01:47.250> had<00:01:47.490> the<00:01:47.520> Toby<00:01:47.939> and<00:01:48.270> the<00:01:48.780> merge

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
the other one had the Toby and the merge

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.560 
the other one had the Toby and the merge
of<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:49.320> two<00:01:49.470> enabled<00:01:50.100> to<00:01:50.399> have<00:01:50.549> this<00:01:50.700> original

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
of the two enabled to have this original

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.590 
of the two enabled to have this original
design<00:01:52.380> so<00:01:52.590> it's<00:01:53.189> really<00:01:53.399> kind<00:01:53.729> of<00:01:53.850> a<00:01:53.909> tech

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
design so it's really kind of a tech

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:00.630 
design so it's really kind of a tech
nice<00:01:54.750> it<00:01:54.899> E<00:01:55.020> is<00:01:55.259> used<00:01:55.979> for<00:01:56.729> design<00:01:57.299> purposes

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:00.640 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:03.700 

this<00:02:01.640> particular<00:02:02.120> model<00:02:02.420> is<00:02:02.750> made<00:02:03.530> out<00:02:03.680> of

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:03.710 
this particular model is made out of

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:05.920 
this particular model is made out of
pink<00:02:04.070> all<00:02:04.280> there's<00:02:04.970> also<00:02:05.120> a<00:02:05.300> white<00:02:05.660> gold
