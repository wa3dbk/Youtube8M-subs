now<00:00:01.140> we<00:00:01.199> are<00:00:01.530> in<00:00:01.770> the<00:00:01.920> last<00:00:02.070> stage<00:00:02.399> before

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:02.730 
now we are in the last stage before

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:05.300 
now we are in the last stage before
finishing<00:00:03.300> our<00:00:03.659> drawing<00:00:04.200> and<00:00:04.350> sending<00:00:04.799> it<00:00:04.920> to

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:05.310 
finishing our drawing and sending it to

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.570 
finishing our drawing and sending it to
printing<00:00:06.230> so<00:00:07.230> as<00:00:07.560> we<00:00:07.710> see<00:00:07.950> we<00:00:08.189> add<00:00:08.340> all

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
printing so as we see we add all

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.200 
printing so as we see we add all
dimensions<00:00:09.179> and<00:00:09.690> we<00:00:10.320> had<00:00:10.800> a<00:00:11.130> look<00:00:11.280> at<00:00:11.759> the

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
dimensions and we had a look at the

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.930 
dimensions and we had a look at the
views<00:00:12.750> on<00:00:13.650> different<00:00:13.710> views<00:00:14.250> if<00:00:14.460> you<00:00:14.580> want<00:00:14.849> to

views on different views if you want to

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.290 
views on different views if you want to
use<00:00:15.150> some<00:00:15.809> special<00:00:16.199> of<00:00:16.440> views<00:00:16.680> to<00:00:17.039> make<00:00:17.460> some

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
use some special of views to make some

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.609 
use some special of views to make some
parts<00:00:18.660> clear<00:00:18.990> to<00:00:19.380> see<00:00:19.590> or<00:00:19.859> whatever<00:00:20.789> and<00:00:21.689> also

parts clear to see or whatever and also
if<00:00:22.890> you<00:00:23.010> go<00:00:23.160> to<00:00:23.189> annotation<00:00:23.939> you<00:00:24.150> will<00:00:24.269> have

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
if you go to annotation you will have

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.070 
if you go to annotation you will have
the<00:00:25.109> surface<00:00:25.650> finish<00:00:25.830> word<00:00:26.279> sample<00:00:26.689> and<00:00:27.689> so<00:00:27.869> on

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
the surface finish word sample and so on

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.490 
the surface finish word sample and so on
the<00:00:28.230> art<00:00:28.439> is<00:00:28.650> to<00:00:29.130> use<00:00:29.310> just<00:00:30.119> to<00:00:30.510> lick<00:00:30.720> what<00:00:31.260> you

bit of material so also you can show it
on<00:02:51.030> the<00:02:51.330> parts<00:02:51.900> they<00:02:52.650> will<00:02:52.860> look<00:02:53.610> okay<00:02:53.790> but<00:02:54.270> in

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:54.960 
on the parts they will look okay but in

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:57.170 
on the parts they will look okay but in
this<00:02:55.110> case<00:02:55.380> we<00:02:55.620> don't<00:02:55.680> have<00:02:55.860> sub<00:02:56.610> assemblies

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
this case we don't have sub assemblies

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.180 
this case we don't have sub assemblies
so<00:02:57.450> you'll<00:02:57.600> get<00:02:57.840> the<00:02:58.080> same<00:02:58.320> type<00:02:58.920> of<00:02:58.950> material

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
so you'll get the same type of material

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:02.150 
so you'll get the same type of material
now<00:03:00.180> we<00:03:00.240> have<00:03:00.600> an<00:03:00.930> issue<00:03:01.140> that<00:03:01.290> we<00:03:01.770> see<00:03:01.800> our

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
now we have an issue that we see our

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.120 
now we have an issue that we see our
beloved<00:03:02.610> here<00:03:02.820> well<00:03:03.120> we<00:03:03.660> don't<00:03:03.900> know<00:03:04.170> where

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
beloved here well we don't know where

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:07.700 
beloved here well we don't know where
are<00:03:05.430> the<00:03:05.670> parts<00:03:06.000> for<00:03:06.240> example<00:03:06.300> who<00:03:07.230> are<00:03:07.260> not

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:07.710 
are the parts for example who are not

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:09.620 
are the parts for example who are not
familiar<00:03:08.010> with<00:03:08.310> crystals<00:03:08.790> will<00:03:09.120> not<00:03:09.330> know

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
familiar with crystals will not know

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:11.890 
familiar with crystals will not know
where<00:03:09.840> the<00:03:10.050> piston<00:03:10.230> head<00:03:10.530> missing<00:03:11.100> pin<00:03:11.340> so

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
where the piston head missing pin so

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:16.040 
where the piston head missing pin so
here<00:03:12.900> comes<00:03:13.290> the<00:03:13.710> use<00:03:13.950> of<00:03:14.370> balloons<00:03:15.150> so<00:03:15.690> you

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:16.050 
here comes the use of balloons so you

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:19.010 
here comes the use of balloons so you
have<00:03:16.200> balloons<00:03:16.680> you<00:03:17.220> are<00:03:17.370> able<00:03:17.760> to<00:03:18.020> add

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:19.020 
have balloons you are able to add

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:22.970 
have balloons you are able to add
balloons<00:03:20.150> one<00:03:21.150> by<00:03:21.390> one<00:03:21.660> so<00:03:22.440> for<00:03:22.530> example<00:03:22.860> this

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
balloons one by one so for example this

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:24.620 
balloons one by one so for example this
is<00:03:23.190> number<00:03:24.060> one

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 
is number one

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:27.890 
is number one
this<00:03:24.810> is<00:03:24.990> the<00:03:25.290> piston<00:03:25.710> head<00:03:26.780> automatically<00:03:27.780> it

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
this is the piston head automatically it

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:31.670 
this is the piston head automatically it
is<00:03:27.930> wide<00:03:28.740> so<00:03:29.640> if<00:03:29.850> you<00:03:30.630> have<00:03:30.780> here<00:03:31.050> number<00:03:31.380> one

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
is wide so if you have here number one

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.880 
is wide so if you have here number one
and<00:03:31.980> if<00:03:32.820> you<00:03:32.970> click<00:03:33.240> this<00:03:33.480> one<00:03:33.540> you<00:03:34.500> would<00:03:34.680> get

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
and if you click this one you would get

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:39.370 
and if you click this one you would get
number<00:03:35.190> three<00:03:35.430> which<00:03:36.270> is<00:03:36.540> piston<00:03:37.290> rod<00:03:37.530> and

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:39.380 
number three which is piston rod and

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:45.560 
number three which is piston rod and
here<00:03:40.380> you<00:03:40.740> can<00:03:40.980> see<00:03:42.200> number<00:03:43.200> four<00:03:44.210> which<00:03:45.210> is

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:45.570 
here you can see number four which is

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:49.070 
here you can see number four which is
the<00:03:45.870> piston<00:03:46.290> rod<00:03:46.440> cap<00:03:47.060> then<00:03:48.060> you<00:03:48.270> have<00:03:48.510> here

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:49.080 
the piston rod cap then you have here

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:56.720 
the piston rod cap then you have here
number<00:03:49.980> two<00:03:50.240> the<00:03:53.870> piston<00:03:54.870> pin<00:03:55.200> so<00:03:56.010> we<00:03:56.220> can<00:03:56.430> also

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
number two the piston pin so we can also

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:59.420 
number two the piston pin so we can also
if<00:03:57.120> you<00:03:57.300> have<00:03:57.630> a<00:03:57.840> lot<00:03:57.990> of<00:03:58.020> parts<00:03:58.560> and<00:03:59.070> you<00:03:59.220> don't

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
if you have a lot of parts and you don't

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:02.530 
if you have a lot of parts and you don't
want<00:03:59.670> to<00:03:59.820> do<00:04:00.000> with<00:04:00.390> one<00:04:00.900> by<00:04:01.110> one<00:04:01.350> you<00:04:02.220> just

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:02.540 
want to do with one by one you just

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:05.150 
want to do with one by one you just
cancel<00:04:03.540> these<00:04:03.870> balloons<00:04:04.320> click<00:04:04.710> on<00:04:04.980> the

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:05.160 
cancel these balloons click on the

00:04:42.569 --> 00:04:47.089 
yourself it's not churning this part
we're<00:04:43.530> going<00:04:43.680> to<00:04:43.860> have<00:04:44.819> it<00:04:45.030> here<00:04:45.539> so<00:04:46.530> when

00:04:47.089 --> 00:04:47.099 
we're going to have it here so when

00:04:47.099 --> 00:04:48.559 
we're going to have it here so when
you're<00:04:47.280> done<00:04:47.610> click<00:04:47.879> OK

00:04:52.429 --> 00:04:52.439 
and so now our drawing is almost ready

00:04:52.439 --> 00:04:54.529 
and so now our drawing is almost ready
to<00:04:53.009> be<00:04:53.550> printed

00:04:54.529 --> 00:04:54.539 
to be printed

00:04:54.539 --> 00:04:57.709 
to be printed
because<00:04:55.229> sinkhole<00:04:56.069> dimensions<00:04:56.819> balloons

00:04:57.709 --> 00:04:57.719 
because sinkhole dimensions balloons

00:04:57.719 --> 00:05:01.790

and<00:05:02.159> so<00:05:03.060> on

00:05:03.379 --> 00:05:03.389 
and so on

00:05:03.389 --> 00:05:06.619 
and so on
so<00:05:04.229> I<00:05:04.259> hope<00:05:04.560> this<00:05:04.830> set<00:05:05.099> of<00:05:05.250> torah<00:05:05.580> was<00:05:05.849> useful

00:05:06.619 --> 00:05:06.629 
so I hope this set of torah was useful

00:05:06.629 --> 00:05:08.950 
so I hope this set of torah was useful
and<00:05:06.840> you<00:05:07.500> are<00:05:07.710> ready<00:05:07.949> to<00:05:07.979> create<00:05:08.460> your<00:05:08.909> own

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:08.960 
and you are ready to create your own
