00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:03.120 
stabilizing force and of all the forces

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:08.740 
stabilizing force and of all the forces
that<00:00:03.419> are<00:00:03.600> needed<00:00:04.230> at<00:00:04.380> this<00:00:04.560> time<00:00:04.670> this<00:00:06.620> this

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:08.750 
that are needed at this time this this

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:14.450 
that are needed at this time this this
is<00:00:09.750> the<00:00:09.990> most<00:00:10.200> viable<00:00:12.650> yeah<00:00:13.650> you<00:00:13.950> know<00:00:14.070> I<00:00:14.099> get

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
is the most viable yeah you know I get

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.540 
is the most viable yeah you know I get
this<00:00:14.700> at<00:00:15.150> least<00:00:15.360> intellectually<00:00:16.340> but<00:00:17.340> the

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
this at least intellectually but the

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.370 
this at least intellectually but the
doing<00:00:17.970> of<00:00:18.060> it's<00:00:18.270> another<00:00:18.539> thing<00:00:18.869> I<00:00:19.020> mean<00:00:19.140> maybe

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
doing of it's another thing I mean maybe

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.800 
doing of it's another thing I mean maybe
this<00:00:19.650> is<00:00:19.830> too<00:00:19.949> extreme<00:00:20.250> of<00:00:20.460> an<00:00:20.550> example<00:00:21.119> but<00:00:21.300> if

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
this is too extreme of an example but if

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.630 
this is too extreme of an example but if
they're<00:00:22.020> food<00:00:22.230> shortages<00:00:22.830> and<00:00:23.100> rioting<00:00:23.550> and

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
they're food shortages and rioting and

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.370 
they're food shortages and rioting and
the<00:00:23.699> street<00:00:24.000> breaks<00:00:24.300> out<00:00:24.539> or<00:00:24.810> the<00:00:24.869> economy

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
the street breaks out or the economy

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.560 
the street breaks out or the economy
really<00:00:25.710> you<00:00:25.949> know<00:00:26.070> it<00:00:26.250> goes<00:00:26.400> into<00:00:26.640> meltdown<00:00:27.000> or

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
really you know it goes into meltdown or

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.919 
really you know it goes into meltdown or
you<00:00:28.050> know<00:00:28.140> how<00:00:28.260> do<00:00:28.320> we<00:00:28.439> remain<00:00:29.570> as<00:00:30.570> stable

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
you know how do we remain as stable

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.630 
you know how do we remain as stable
forces<00:00:31.470> I<00:00:31.679> mean<00:00:31.800> wouldn't<00:00:32.070> it<00:00:32.130> be<00:00:32.219> natural<00:00:32.399> to

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
forces I mean wouldn't it be natural to

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.400 
forces I mean wouldn't it be natural to
get<00:00:32.730> kind<00:00:32.969> of<00:00:33.059> caught<00:00:33.300> up<00:00:33.510> in<00:00:33.690> the<00:00:33.780> chaos<00:00:33.989> and

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
get kind of caught up in the chaos and

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.069 
get kind of caught up in the chaos and
said<00:00:34.620> it<00:00:35.309> affects<00:00:35.640> us<00:00:35.880> and<00:00:36.120> I<00:00:36.630> think<00:00:36.899> it<00:00:36.989> would

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
said it affects us and I think it would

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:38.990 
said it affects us and I think it would
be<00:00:37.170> very<00:00:37.320> hard<00:00:37.649> to<00:00:37.739> remain<00:00:38.129> in<00:00:38.370> the<00:00:38.460> heart<00:00:38.760> or

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
be very hard to remain in the heart or

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.389 
be very hard to remain in the heart or
or<00:00:39.660> express<00:00:40.230> a<00:00:40.260> love<00:00:40.590> centered<00:00:40.890> life<00:00:41.070> in<00:00:41.309> the

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
or express a love centered life in the

or express a love centered life in the

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
midst of this kind of chaos at least I'm

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.000 
midst of this kind of chaos at least I'm
not<00:00:44.430> predicting<00:00:44.640> there'll<00:00:45.360> be<00:00:45.420> chaos<00:00:46.010> though

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
not predicting there'll be chaos though

not predicting there'll be chaos though
it's<00:00:47.190> a<00:00:47.280> possibility<00:00:48.350> much<00:00:49.350> of<00:00:49.500> the

let me answer you this way if the people

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.199 
let me answer you this way if the people
of<00:02:41.930> our<00:02:42.019> world<00:02:42.079> knew<00:02:42.739> only<00:02:43.310> the<00:02:43.519> condition<00:02:43.880> of

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:44.209 
of our world knew only the condition of

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:47.020 
of our world knew only the condition of
sleep<00:02:44.860> it<00:02:45.860> would<00:02:46.099> be<00:02:46.220> logical<00:02:46.430> that<00:02:46.849> they

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
sleep it would be logical that they

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.229 
sleep it would be logical that they
would<00:02:47.239> then<00:02:47.390> fear<00:02:47.780> the<00:02:48.049> dawn<00:02:48.940> the<00:02:49.940> people

00:02:52.119 --> 00:02:52.129 
would wonder what is the strange light

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:56.860 
would wonder what is the strange light
that<00:02:52.519> awakens<00:02:53.000> us<00:02:54.160> this<00:02:55.160> is<00:02:55.370> the<00:02:55.549> time<00:02:55.870> when

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
that awakens us this is the time when

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:00.640 
that awakens us this is the time when
spirit<00:02:57.650> is<00:02:57.950> victorious<00:02:58.879> over<00:02:59.209> the<00:02:59.930> forces<00:03:00.379> of

spirit is victorious over the forces of
materialization<00:03:01.579> and<00:03:01.760> it<00:03:02.390> will<00:03:02.660> emerge<00:03:03.230> with

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920 
materialization and it will emerge with

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.520 
materialization and it will emerge with
the<00:03:04.040> calm<00:03:04.340> supremacy<00:03:05.209> that's<00:03:05.900> the<00:03:06.140> signature

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
the calm supremacy that's the signature

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:09.520 
the calm supremacy that's the signature
of<00:03:06.709> its<00:03:06.980> source<00:03:07.220> and<00:03:07.610> this<00:03:07.760> this<00:03:08.480> emergence<00:03:09.260> is

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
you see I could give you this technique

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:16.400 
you see I could give you this technique
or<00:04:13.890> the<00:04:14.040> hat<00:04:14.189> but<00:04:14.549> in<00:04:14.700> the<00:04:14.819> end<00:04:15.000> it's<00:04:15.959> really
