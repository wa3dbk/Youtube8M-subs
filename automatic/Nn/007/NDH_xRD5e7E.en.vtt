it or whatever but I mean I thought
about<00:00:45.450> it<00:00:45.690> deeply<00:00:45.840> though<00:00:46.140> like<00:00:46.379> I<00:00:46.620> don't

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
about it deeply though like I don't

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.430 
about it deeply though like I don't
think<00:00:47.789> like<00:00:48.180> if<00:00:48.329> I<00:00:48.480> were<00:00:48.600> to<00:00:48.780> bet<00:00:48.989> on<00:00:49.170> it<00:00:49.320> I

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
think like if I were to bet on it I

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:50.900 
think like if I were to bet on it I
don't<00:00:49.500> know<00:00:49.739> this<00:00:49.890> for<00:00:49.950> sure<00:00:50.100> I<00:00:50.309> didn't<00:00:50.670> do<00:00:50.730> no

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
don't know this for sure I didn't do no

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.639 
don't know this for sure I didn't do no
research<00:00:51.300> on<00:00:51.449> it<00:00:51.629> whatever<00:00:51.780> but<00:00:52.079> if<00:00:52.230> I<00:00:52.350> knew<00:00:52.500> if
