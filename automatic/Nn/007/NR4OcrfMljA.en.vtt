00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:35.420
 eicma 2012 stand educated let's try here a 

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:37.940
 biggest news of ducats for 2013 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:40.400
 it is the ai per strada ne 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:42.560
 we will talk with federico sabbioni project 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:44.510
 manager of the hypermotard line for 

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:46.670
 find to discover with him all the 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:49.400
 details and refinements and evolutions 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:53.050
 of the hypermotard we have completely 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:55.400
 revolutionized the hyper motard by doing 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:57.410
 a generational evolution that starts 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.300
 from the 4-valve engine cooled to 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:01.720
 liquid 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:04.820
 821 of displacement is particularly 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:06.830
 suitable for application is so wide 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:09.200
 let's say he gave sporty driving but 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:11.420
 also a more oriented application 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.580
 touring as l2 street thanks to the fact 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.530
 which maintains similar characteristics to 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:17.659
 the multistrada one is therefore a 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:20.210
 testastretta 11 degrees with crossing 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:22.310
 reduced and with a layout of 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:23.510
 injection as well as the secondary area 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.159
 which are the features it gives 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:26.690
 this year to 2013 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:27.950
 we introduced on the engine of the 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:29.600
 multi-road to optimize the 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:31.010
 regularity of travel therefore for the 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.260
 born a performance that is not alone 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:36.530
 the pure one of the performance however it is 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:37.910
 an engine of 110 horses and more than 9 kg 3 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.160
 of torque therefore a performance rather than 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:41.630
 generous but also in the first 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.840
 performance in terms of usability of 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:43.840
 usability 

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:56.610
 from a slightly driving position 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:58.170
 less extreme than those of pressed 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.220
 previous where the bust is very close 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.260
 on the handlebar so here we have a 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:03.090
 loosely spaced out but relaxed 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:05.100
 however with an easy handling 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.860
 really high level 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:11.310
 this is the concept we have been looking for 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.690
 to realize in the entry version 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.940
 let's say to be standard and to 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:17.070
 extreme in the sp is a concept 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.140
 which had inside features 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:21.360
 like the generous suspension things 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.220
 ground clearance and a driving position 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.230
 a buster f arms a little more relaxed 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.360
 as I said they were squeezing anyway 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.890
 I like to say the multistrada eye 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.750
 that you have on the street can be seen as 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:33.660
 the sister of the hyper mutagen its cousin 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:36.930
 of the multi endowment with note then 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:39.300
 see but from a central stand two 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:41.610
 power outlets 12 times the 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:44.100
 front windshield handlebar 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:46.410
 raised 20 mm more mudguards 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:49.070
 protective a cup parÃ  but above all 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:51.360
 an ergonomic and effective handle 

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:53.340
 grip for the passenger who integrates 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.840
 the support of the bags therefore the bags 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.640
 they are very clean 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:59.850
 without frames without added elements 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:01.650
 and a saddle that in addition to the graphic one 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:03.090
 specifically designed driver form 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:04.860
 road then with a passing pillow 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:06.510
 a bit wider than horizontal bigica 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:08.850
 cozy this engine has 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:11.100
 an extremely more regular supply 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:13.760
 at the bass and then above all at the extension 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.760
 of the four valves
