here's this app s120 trimmer brush

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:08.540 
here's this app s120 trimmer brush
cutter<00:00:04.220> just<00:00:05.220> come<00:00:05.370> in<00:00:05.520> last<00:00:05.700> night<00:00:07.519> now<00:00:08.519> the

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
cutter just come in last night now the

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.580 
cutter just come in last night now the
guy<00:00:08.849> said<00:00:09.179> that<00:00:09.389> one<00:00:09.570> of<00:00:09.599> his<00:00:09.780> employees<00:00:10.170> ran

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
guy said that one of his employees ran

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.490 
guy said that one of his employees ran
it<00:00:10.769> for<00:00:11.040> approximately<00:00:11.420> half<00:00:12.420> an<00:00:12.630> hour<00:00:12.809> with

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
it for approximately half an hour with

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.220 
it for approximately half an hour with
no<00:00:13.710> oil<00:00:13.920> in<00:00:14.160> the<00:00:14.250> gas<00:00:14.450> I'm<00:00:15.450> surprised<00:00:15.900> it<00:00:16.109> would

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
no oil in the gas I'm surprised it would

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.519 
no oil in the gas I'm surprised it would
even<00:00:16.440> run<00:00:16.650> that<00:00:16.920> long<00:00:17.690> so<00:00:18.690> I'll<00:00:18.990> just<00:00:19.260> show<00:00:19.500> you

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
even run that long so I'll just show you

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.260 
even run that long so I'll just show you
usually<00:00:20.160> like<00:00:20.340> I<00:00:20.520> mentioned<00:00:21.060> in<00:00:21.150> a<00:00:21.240> previous

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
usually like I mentioned in a previous

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.240 
usually like I mentioned in a previous
video<00:00:21.960> if<00:00:22.230> there's<00:00:22.529> a<00:00:22.619> lot<00:00:22.740> of<00:00:22.890> compression

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
video if there's a lot of compression

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.460 
video if there's a lot of compression
you<00:00:23.820> can<00:00:23.850> grab<00:00:24.210> the<00:00:24.390> Machine<00:00:24.750> and<00:00:24.930> lift<00:00:25.380> the

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
you can grab the Machine and lift the

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.859 
you can grab the Machine and lift the
whole<00:00:25.619> machine<00:00:26.269> just<00:00:27.269> by<00:00:27.420> pulling<00:00:27.660> on<00:00:27.810> the

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
whole machine just by pulling on the

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.840 
whole machine just by pulling on the
cord<00:00:28.260> but<00:00:29.010> in<00:00:29.189> this<00:00:29.340> case<00:00:29.580> you<00:00:29.789> can<00:00:30.060> just<00:00:31.850> I've

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
cord but in this case you can just I've

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.850 
cord but in this case you can just I've
seen<00:00:33.180> smaller<00:00:33.510> trimmers<00:00:34.020> with<00:00:34.230> a<00:00:34.410> lot<00:00:34.649> more

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
seen smaller trimmers with a lot more

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.290 
seen smaller trimmers with a lot more
compression<00:00:35.399> than<00:00:35.520> that<00:00:35.730> so<00:00:36.000> I'll<00:00:36.090> take<00:00:36.239> it

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
compression than that so I'll take it

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.119 
compression than that so I'll take it
apart<00:00:36.690> and<00:00:36.899> I'll<00:00:37.230> show<00:00:37.410> you<00:00:37.469> what<00:00:37.710> happens

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
going to come out of its compartment on

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:59.300 
going to come out of its compartment on
the<00:02:55.709> carb<00:02:56.489> here<00:02:57.470> next<00:02:58.470> you<00:02:58.680> can<00:02:58.829> just<00:02:59.040> pull<00:02:59.190> the

00:03:04.339 --> 00:03:04.349 
fuel line's down you don't need to take

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:07.399 
fuel line's down you don't need to take
these<00:03:04.560> off<00:03:05.510> so<00:03:06.510> now<00:03:06.659> you<00:03:06.720> got<00:03:06.900> to<00:03:06.989> remove<00:03:07.200> these

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:22.739 
here it's going to come off and it's

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:24.320 
here it's going to come off and it's
going<00:03:22.860> to<00:03:22.980> separate<00:03:23.400> itself<00:03:23.760> from<00:03:24.060> the

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:24.330 
going to separate itself from the

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:30.770 
going to separate itself from the
cylinder<00:03:25.790> remove<00:03:26.790> the<00:03:26.970> spark<00:03:27.209> plug<00:03:27.480> cap<00:03:29.780> so

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
cylinder remove the spark plug cap so

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:44.130 

let<00:03:38.410> me<00:03:38.500> have<00:03:38.650> to<00:03:38.800> wiggle<00:03:38.980> it<00:03:39.220> a<00:03:39.250> bit<00:03:40.080> study<00:03:43.140> so

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:44.140 
let me have to wiggle it a bit study so

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:46.440 
let me have to wiggle it a bit study so
here's<00:03:44.380> the<00:03:44.500> piston<00:03:44.950> and<00:03:45.070> rings<00:03:45.370> you<00:03:45.940> can<00:03:46.120> see

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:46.450 
here's the piston and rings you can see

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:50.370 
here's the piston and rings you can see
it's<00:03:46.860> been<00:03:47.860> through<00:03:48.100> a<00:03:48.130> beating<00:03:49.020> it's<00:03:50.020> really

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:50.380 
it's been through a beating it's really

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:53.310 
it's been through a beating it's really
bad<00:03:50.910> that's<00:03:51.910> a<00:03:52.090> side<00:03:52.300> of<00:03:52.330> the<00:03:52.570> exhaust<00:03:52.870> port

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:53.320 
bad that's a side of the exhaust port

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:57.690 
bad that's a side of the exhaust port
it's<00:03:53.740> even<00:03:54.010> worse<00:03:54.190> on<00:03:54.430> that<00:03:54.610> side<00:03:56.370> the<00:03:57.370> crank

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:57.700 
it's even worse on that side the crank

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:00.030 
it's even worse on that side the crank
bearings<00:03:58.180> don't<00:03:58.630> seem<00:03:58.900> too<00:03:59.170> bad<00:03:59.410> I<00:03:59.440> don't<00:03:59.800> feel

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.040 
bearings don't seem too bad I don't feel

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:04.230 
bearings don't seem too bad I don't feel
any<00:04:00.310> loose<00:04:00.670> in<00:04:00.940> there<00:04:01.180> and<00:04:02.370> on<00:04:03.370> this<00:04:03.550> side<00:04:03.850> it

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:04.240 
any loose in there and on this side it

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:10.430 
any loose in there and on this side it
seems<00:04:04.420> pretty<00:04:04.810> tight<00:04:05.490> the<00:04:06.490> cylinder<00:04:07.030> is<00:04:07.240> shot

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:10.440 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:13.380 

there's<00:04:11.440> the<00:04:11.800> inside<00:04:12.280> wall<00:04:12.580> of<00:04:12.880> the<00:04:13.120> cylinder

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:13.390 
there's the inside wall of the cylinder

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:16.920 
there's the inside wall of the cylinder
on<00:04:13.870> the<00:04:14.500> exhaust<00:04:14.770> port<00:04:15.450> you<00:04:16.450> can<00:04:16.630> see<00:04:16.840> it

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:16.930 
on the exhaust port you can see it

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:20.220 
on the exhaust port you can see it
scratched<00:04:17.380> and<00:04:18.150> it's<00:04:19.150> also<00:04:19.329> scratched<00:04:19.870> and

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:20.230 
scratched and it's also scratched and

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:22.830 
scratched and it's also scratched and
other<00:04:20.950> sides<00:04:21.340> of<00:04:21.669> the<00:04:22.030> cylinder<00:04:22.270> there<00:04:22.720> as

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:22.840 
other sides of the cylinder there as

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:27.300 
other sides of the cylinder there as
well<00:04:23.080> so<00:04:25.050> that's<00:04:26.050> what<00:04:26.260> happens<00:04:26.680> when<00:04:27.040> you<00:04:27.130> run

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:27.310 
well so that's what happens when you run

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:29.850 
well so that's what happens when you run
requirement<00:04:27.880> with<00:04:28.030> no<00:04:28.180> oil<00:04:28.560> so<00:04:29.560> I'm<00:04:29.650> going<00:04:29.800> to

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:29.860 
requirement with no oil so I'm going to

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:31.980 
requirement with no oil so I'm going to
price<00:04:30.130> the<00:04:30.400> cylinder<00:04:30.970> kit<00:04:31.210> which<00:04:31.419> comes<00:04:31.690> with

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:31.990 
price the cylinder kit which comes with

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:34.710 
price the cylinder kit which comes with
the<00:04:32.080> piston<00:04:32.530> rings<00:04:33.130> and<00:04:33.430> the<00:04:34.090> cylinder<00:04:34.540> head

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:34.720 
the piston rings and the cylinder head

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:37.500 
the piston rings and the cylinder head
it<00:04:35.590> is<00:04:35.650> a<00:04:35.770> five<00:04:36.220> six<00:04:36.640> hundred<00:04:36.760> dollar<00:04:37.090> machine

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:37.510 
it is a five six hundred dollar machine

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:40.560 
it is a five six hundred dollar machine
brand-new<00:04:37.960> to<00:04:38.140> replace<00:04:38.790> so<00:04:39.790> it<00:04:40.060> may<00:04:40.240> be<00:04:40.270> worth

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:40.570 
brand-new to replace so it may be worth

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:44.790 
brand-new to replace so it may be worth
