 cable car do not go 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:55.030

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:55.030

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:59.040

 we go 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:12.900
 I have an idea I do not have money if I'm 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.780
 of course I have money 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.950
 It is done 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:20.610

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:24.020
 and now if erc iu days 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:28.260
 to network and minimum part to sunset 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:31.670
 perfect situation to show you the 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.670
 super somersault 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.400
 If you want to do it, follow these 

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:40.380
 recommendations 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:45.370
 ok you have to stop here 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:48.370
 admire the great view that there is 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:51.760
 and those who want to count until 3 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:53.930
 to be able to order and jump ok 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:56.469
 a 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:56.469
 do not 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:05.550
 runs runs runs frame and if you can 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:05.550
 chubby if you can 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.299
 to see 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.980
 the pixel 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:20.230
 every activity that we are in the making 

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:23.580
 number 2 of the super somersault 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:27.610
 let's hope that this time it is correct 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:31.170
 so there comes the how the 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:31.170
 spherical if the cable car 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:35.819
 and hopefully this time we get it right 

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:45.260
 it is pesos it costs the army to omit the 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:48.500
 trip x the trip what is important is the 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:50.770
 super somersault and find a 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:50.770
 thing 

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:58.810
 Oh 

00:03:55.300 --> 00:04:01.420
 ok more orchids I said 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:05.910
 these are these are the steps that have 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:05.910
 what to take to be able to throw 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:17.470
 and join and say god and s3 run run 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:21.600
 runs jumps 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:21.600
 and open it yes 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:30.350
 this orchid is the super somersault 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:33.880
 and see the view 

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:33.880
 in sight potatoes 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:41.020
 I even say 

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:49.960
 I do but it's okay to provide the view 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:52.470
 behind us 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:55.160
 of the sun 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:57.230
 Sun Sea and sand 

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:59.560
 ok now let's see if we can fall in 

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:59.560
 the sea 

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:08.059
 somewhere strategic for what 

00:05:03.569 --> 00:05:08.059
 why design a little bit of the sea 

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:15.050
 I think that this donor is the most 

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:17.629
 high 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:21.650
 from which you can jump here in the gta 

00:05:17.629 --> 00:05:25.190
 five la mamen is a great game 

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:28.900
 and if they like the feil and I know that 

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:28.900
 you will like to leave your line 

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:37.920
 this is the kinematic shot 

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:42.960
 I do not know how you can say 

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:46.400
 okay 

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:53.920
 this date because then you can get in 

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:56.740
 some fucking whores or 3 

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:58.930
 good good macho he 

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:01.320
 the color of him 

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:04.430
 for falls 

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:04.430
 in the waves 

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:16.080
 I do not want to go down to the legs until 

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:16.080
 the legs do not get wet 

00:06:19.249 --> 00:06:26.089
 cause your costume and see this is the sea 

00:06:23.169 --> 00:06:29.149

00:06:26.089 --> 00:06:33.650

00:06:29.149 --> 00:06:35.570
 super deadly jump runs I'll save you
