00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.269
 constantly looking for new ones 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:15.000

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:17.210
 just the life of the 48-year-old and 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.500
 even in sleep 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:21.630
 I'm lucky that the textile 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.740
 Dream exhausting too, because I'm there 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.109
 sometimes get up god in the morning 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.939
 worked all night but it is so 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.260
 that come up with the ideas and moods 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.300
 stay and then I often have that 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.920
 same dream and specifically in the morning 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.440
 monument that could become the idea 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:37.020

 becomes fashion and lives guido maria 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.950
 kretschmer probably every day 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:43.110
 his personal dream already as 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.210
 child he wanted to advertise fashion designer 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.450
 always wanted to change things 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.010
 shape 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:52.050
 creativity is for many people 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.610
 This has to happen so consciously for me 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.719
 It is part of my life to know it 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.969
 not at all my parents have 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:59.100
 always roll a few at christmas 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.879
 get a roll of furniture 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.079
 can move 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.910
 because they were afraid of me 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.830
 my young back spoil by 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.600
 because I am always confining all dresser 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.909
 when the were away because pushed off 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.130
 I never wanted to be changes 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.710
 to stay true to his lineage 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.409
 kretschmers motto in front of the camera or in 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.030
 his atelier contact fears are him 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.640
 strange 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:23.369
 I am very fast in action and very fast 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.270
 the new one also shows such a picture of the new 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.009
 again roller coaster 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.299
 I am someone who is afraid though 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.310
 in the first place sets the wind 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.869
 I want to look up and down 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.490
 goes and I'm not done for 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.229
 second row to be allowed to me what I too 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.640
 but I thought it was nice when I did that 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:38.220
 do and so is a bit my life 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.579
 and that's why I'm so brave I would 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.829
 say 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:42.390
 He goes his way and tries 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:44.939
 overcome barriers 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.890
 with his fashion in his life like that 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:48.420
 he confesses himself openly to his 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.159
 homosexuality 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.600
 this really is not a vocational training 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.340
 one does not think and now becomes 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.799
 I spool around sexually that's it 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.119
 so and you have to say that all the 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.770
 gay and lesbians that exist and 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.540
 maybe the different ones will be 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.050
 All recruited from normal 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.460
 family 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:04.200
 that you are every one of today I say 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.820
 I do not want to do that tomorrow 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.140
 maybe the father a gay guys 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.520
 and I believe the only one 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.290
 Commitment I see with parents 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.570
 is that your children are alive 

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:13.320
 personal life design is long ago 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:15.420
 risen 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:17.700
 guido maria kretschmer is a designer 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:20.190
 a concept remains worldwide 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:22.230
 I still wish I could 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:25.170
 Kate Winslet breakfast that would be determined 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:27.270
 single with kate winslet a muesli 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.640
 crunch this dream will be the 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:31.440
 maybe also fulfill and kate 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.980
 and Guido Maria at a table together 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:37.520
 that would be a very creative one 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.520
 breakfast
