them<00:02:47.580> over<00:02:48.120> here<00:02:48.390> is<00:02:48.600> the<00:02:49.170> RPMs<00:02:49.650> that<00:02:49.890> tells<00:02:50.100> us

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
them over here is the RPMs that tells us

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.610 
them over here is the RPMs that tells us
it's<00:02:50.400> a<00:02:50.490> tachometer<00:02:50.880> for<00:02:51.330> the<00:02:51.390> propeller

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
it's a tachometer for the propeller

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:53.869 
it's a tachometer for the propeller
above<00:02:52.890> that<00:02:53.099> is<00:02:53.340> something<00:02:53.580> called<00:02:53.730> the

00:02:53.869 --> 00:02:53.879 
above that is something called the

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:55.729 
above that is something called the

manifold pressure gauge it's a way of

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:58.390 
manifold pressure gauge it's a way of
telling<00:02:56.129> us<00:02:56.220> how<00:02:56.340> much<00:02:56.489> power<00:02:56.760> we're<00:02:57.150> putting

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
telling us how much power we're putting

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.160

to<00:02:59.400> the<00:02:59.580> engine<00:03:00.030> you<00:03:00.269> want<00:03:00.450> you<00:03:00.569> and<00:03:00.810> we<00:03:00.989> use

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
to the engine you want you and we use

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:04.220 
to the engine you want you and we use
these<00:03:01.440> knobs<00:03:01.799> down<00:03:02.040> here<00:03:02.610> to<00:03:02.989> control<00:03:03.989> that

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
these knobs down here to control that

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.970 
push in go fast pull out to go slow blue
knob<00:03:10.590> controls<00:03:11.519> the<00:03:11.970> pitch<00:03:12.120> of<00:03:12.299> the<00:03:12.360> propeller

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:12.980 
knob controls the pitch of the propeller

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:16.069

whether<00:03:13.980> you're<00:03:14.519> pushing<00:03:14.879> pushing<00:03:15.659> them<00:03:15.900> you

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:16.079 
whether you're pushing pushing them you

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:19.339 
whether you're pushing pushing them you
increase<00:03:16.709> the<00:03:16.890> RPMs<00:03:17.430> and<00:03:17.819> you<00:03:18.540> have<00:03:18.750> a<00:03:18.780> better

00:03:19.339 --> 00:03:19.349 
increase the RPMs and you have a better

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:21.410 
increase the RPMs and you have a better
climb<00:03:19.680> capability<00:03:20.400> you<00:03:20.519> pull<00:03:20.760> it<00:03:20.879> back<00:03:21.060> you

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
climb capability you pull it back you

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:23.690 
climb capability you pull it back you
have<00:03:21.629> your<00:03:22.349> rpms<00:03:22.950> and<00:03:23.190> it's<00:03:23.370> kind<00:03:23.549> of<00:03:23.610> like

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
have your rpms and it's kind of like

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.240 
have your rpms and it's kind of like
