00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.659
 ah 

00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:04.659
 i 

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:11.830
 hello chachis welcome to a new 

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:14.410
 chapter of small cha today we will see 

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:16.029
 a theme of the killers a group that 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:20.680
 we had never touched and that it was time 

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:22.809
 and let's see his last hit runway is a 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:25.329
 hit that is not characterized by having 

00:00:22.809 --> 00:00:28.390
 a hit structure but rather rather 

00:00:25.329 --> 00:00:31.840
 it's something out of his kind because he does not 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:34.030
 follow that typical structure of verse and 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:36.910
 verse chorus verse chorus or 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:39.100
 verse pre chorus chorus verse 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:41.950
 by refrain refrain not suddenly 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:44.200
 bridges appear ahead of time and 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:47.230
 prescribed ones and ones that do not 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:50.640
 follow the chorus in order with the table 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:53.200
 ture it will have clearer by the 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.010
 grate on the fret 1 because I want 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.010
 play the chords 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:03.080
 the intro the intro does something like 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:21.450
 and this again after the verses in 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:21.450
 the verses the same chords 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:36.409
 next the block the bridge number 1 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:39.170
 bridge number 1 that starts with a fa 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:43.039
 but that I'm going to put it here with 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:48.280
 fifth string the fret tonic 8 and 

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:48.280
 figure of 2 then we start with a fa 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:52.530
 one 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:05.530
 and now comes the pre-chorus with 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:05.530
 gallop rhythm 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.000
 cortez 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:32.819
 as a detail of this pre chorus the 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:39.439
 second the minor 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:39.439
 it is followed by fifth string fret 23 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:44.650
 to finish him 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.439
 to 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:59.390
 the block of the refrains themselves 

00:02:55.460 --> 00:03:02.630
 chords that intro and verses but with a 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:04.970
 little more rhythm and cane I have a 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:08.450
 trick that is that the second chord of the 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:11.350
 wheel hit up then 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:11.350
 we are like this 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:20.849
 i 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:20.849
 i 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:24.200
 ah 

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:36.300
 and to finish we will explain a new 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:39.660
 block the bridge number 2 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:42.740
 which is totally new and unexpected and 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:42.740
 you start with a minor 

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:49.540
 and four glasses 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:06.580
 and I think that's already I think there was 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:08.860
 explained all the blocks of the 

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:10.709
 structure if you have any doubts 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:14.620
 Comment I highly recommend you 

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:16.840
 Have a look at the tabla tura 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:19.750
 what's in the description for you 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:22.210
 everything clear clarinet so nothing 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:25.950
 see you in the next tutorial of 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:25.950
