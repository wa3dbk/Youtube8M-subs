then you could do it - I don't know I'm

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.299 
then you could do it - I don't know I'm
not<00:00:49.140> quite<00:00:49.440> sure<00:00:49.469> it<00:00:49.739> could<00:00:49.860> work<00:00:49.980> or<00:00:50.250> you

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309

gonna try to hit the truck and you're
gonna<00:00:59.910> try<00:01:00.149> to<00:01:00.210> glitch<00:01:00.539> the<00:01:00.719> bike<00:01:00.930> in<00:01:01.199> which<00:01:01.800> is

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
gonna try to glitch the bike in which is

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.549 
gonna try to glitch the bike in which is
one<00:01:02.160> beat<00:01:02.550> one<00:01:02.940> wheel<00:01:03.149> inside<00:01:03.750> the<00:01:03.930> UFO<00:01:04.260> garage

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
one beat one wheel inside the UFO garage

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.080 
one beat one wheel inside the UFO garage
and<00:01:04.769> one<00:01:04.920> wheel<00:01:05.070> outside<00:01:05.460> you<00:01:05.820> know<00:01:05.939> your

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
and one wheel outside you know your

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.570 
and one wheel outside you know your
focal<00:01:06.479> Raj<00:01:06.630> so<00:01:07.140> I<00:01:07.200> hit<00:01:07.590> it<00:01:07.619> again<00:01:08.010> and<00:01:08.400> let's

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
focal Raj so I hit it again and let's

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.270 
focal Raj so I hit it again and let's
see<00:01:08.729> if<00:01:09.030> it<00:01:09.360> works<00:01:09.570> as<00:01:10.409> you<00:01:10.650> can<00:01:10.799> see<00:01:10.950> in<00:01:11.159> the

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
see if it works as you can see in the

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.010 
see if it works as you can see in the
bottom<00:01:11.760> there's<00:01:12.090> basically<00:01:12.570> it's<00:01:12.659> basically

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
bottom there's basically it's basically

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.690 
bottom there's basically it's basically
Galatia<00:01:13.409> and<00:01:13.560> my<00:01:13.680> truck<00:01:13.950> is<00:01:14.070> actually<00:01:14.220> moving

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
Galatia and my truck is actually moving

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.550 
Galatia and my truck is actually moving
so<00:01:15.240> I<00:01:15.270> guess<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:15.689> glitch<00:01:15.930> you<00:01:16.200> know<00:01:16.409> it's

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
so I guess the glitch you know it's

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.050 
so I guess the glitch you know it's
working<00:01:16.740> make<00:01:17.250> sure<00:01:17.460> that<00:01:17.580> you<00:01:17.700> take<00:01:17.939> the

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
working make sure that you take the

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.850 
working make sure that you take the
truck<00:01:18.360> as<00:01:18.540> soon<00:01:18.780> as<00:01:18.900> possible<00:01:19.290> make<00:01:19.590> sure<00:01:19.619> you

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
truck as soon as possible make sure you

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.440 
truck as soon as possible make sure you
