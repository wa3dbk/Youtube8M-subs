00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:20.039
 this is a so-called 3 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:23.130
 With this simple technique you can 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:25.940
 water in bang gas more precisely in 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:29.550
 split brown gas 

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:32.879
 The electrolysis of water is an old one 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.050
 and simple invention she can be very 

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:36.600
 be efficient 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.030
 and even succeed in using materials 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.250
 the hardware store 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:46.320
 The principle is as ingenious as it is simple 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:49.170
 you only need mild suds and 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.600
 current for the electrolysis best 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:55.140
 of course from photovoltaic or 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:58.890
 wind power set that frank immediately 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:02.820
 to race as happened inside is the 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:05.399
 water splitting in the coming 14 off 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:08.700
 and has to go through the water and now 

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:11.159
 we have the gas out there hangars 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:14.549
 The water is cheap to produce and 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:17.070
 Of course, that's very environmentally friendly 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:21.060
 brown bassist brent and owns it 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:29.310
 more energy than petroleum or natural gas 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:32.780
 that's so hot, tungsten melts 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:36.600
 the tauern melts iron steel melts 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:39.920
 and to drip in as short a time as 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:43.560
 child with the flame on ordinary ago 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:46.380
 peter sacher is convinced that one with 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.090
 This gas can also heat and that too 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:53.790
 a fraction of the previous costs 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:54.930
 from petroleum natural gas or wood we create 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.659
 always help 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.320
 that is why we are there what we know what we are 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.540
 do 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.380
 I'm looking for a solution all 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.500
 can do 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.240
 it has to be easy if I know 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.640
 want 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:11.259
 if that is possible but not I can 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.259
 Just try it yourself 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.870
 whose judicial is coming 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:24.120
 look forward to if we are more willing 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:26.819
 are with this vivid dvd the 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:30.090
 detailed on it 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:33.830
 You can use instructions for DIY 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:36.690
 build your own price already now 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:38.640
 everything still experimental now 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.959
 we can heat a house 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.349
 with zero percent 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:46.080
 rob pause then that would be a sensation 

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:49.069
 and maybe you can with this 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:52.069
 one day even all fossil technology 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:54.480
 fuels and fuels through the 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:57.470
 environmentally friendly gas from the water 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.470
 replace 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:08.130
 I built this thing for myself and I am 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:09.750
 so that went to tÃ¼v north him 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:12.239
 I have yet presented the background 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:14.580
 Reported and wanted a license 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:16.260
 have and have the head 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:19.410
 shaken then they say oh oh 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:21.650
 this is a manipulation of a type 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:23.600
 which is allowed what we can not 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:26.850
 accept 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:28.980
 and then I drew attention 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:30.690
 that with 1000's of those things 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:31.050
 Traveling in Germany and driving in Germany 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:35.460
 world 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:40.680
 why did I think you can? 

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:45.180
 me a 125er not only with 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:47.160
 cleared out and now I have a two 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:49.410
 months a video posted with the net 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:51.950
 the generator because only with gas runs 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:56.220
 So actually the engine is running and what 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:59.310
 i'm not saying that i'm over the 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:02.540
 But at least I'm gonna get up 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:05.040
 But that's not all right now 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:07.290
 Amazed last went it will go on 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:09.090
 because we are already there he is from 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:10.800
 people try to do with the and 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:13.890
 would say work 

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:14.370
 Everyone has experimented with each ideas 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:16.709
 around 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:20.760
 it is a real pleasure now what is there 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:23.660
 on it is caused is unbelievable the 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:28.260
 is now nothing but water in it 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:32.460
 Ryanair flies water that fly that 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:35.760
 I always have to give something first 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:36.840
 and then something comes back and 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:39.870
 That's why I have no problems 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:43.260
 to come here 800 kilometers to 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:45.120
 drive in my spare time and I get 

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:46.740
 she comes from that life 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:49.919
 keeps giving us and we have to 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:52.550
 learn to think more in this form and 

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:55.800
 does not have to get something everywhere 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:58.880
 Look at an apple tree he needs 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:02.100
 to reproduce a 85 and then 

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:02.900
 but how many apples after the 400 kilo 

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:06.030
 or more 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:08.430
 that is that I am the law of 

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:09.870
 wealth has come from us and that is 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:12.690
 also in the world inside and the world 

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:15.990
 discover yourself from where it starts 

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:16.590
 will come there can the bars 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:19.820
 to bend 

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:19.820
 as will come
