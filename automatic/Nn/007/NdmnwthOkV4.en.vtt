 Hello dear friends with you 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.899
 Alexander from the channel Jungle for Stevi and 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.970
 Today I am glad to show you the sixth edition 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:11.010
 knife trades heading out of nothing 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.849
 sit back and I wish you 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.849
 pleasant viewing 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:28.270

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:31.599
 field trials which at this 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:33.580
 moment worth three hundred and sixty seven 

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:35.770
 rubles and now I am ready to show you 

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:38.110
 Dear viewers for what I traded him 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:40.059
 Immediately I warn you that you came with 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:42.400
 large time intervals therefore 

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:45.129
 prices have changed a lot and based on this 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:46.930
 I can go out as a big plus so go to 

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:50.830
 minus but at the time of trading 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:53.080
 I was always in the first plus 3d 3d p2000 

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:55.440

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.479
 well-worn 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:09.850
 and went to minus at 120 rubles but 

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:12.100
 I repeat that at the time of release 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.409
 prices have changed so much 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:17.770
 that I went to minus but that moment when 

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:20.080
 trade was made I was in the plus gave them 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:21.909

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:53.200
 not a bad result I apologize for 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.990
