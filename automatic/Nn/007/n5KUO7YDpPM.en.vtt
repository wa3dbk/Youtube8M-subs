00:01:54.199 --> 00:01:54.209 
going to adhere that pattern paper I've

00:01:54.209 --> 00:01:58.489 
going to adhere that pattern paper I've
got<00:01:54.420> a<00:01:54.450> five<00:01:54.810> by<00:01:55.170> five<00:01:55.560> card<00:01:56.069> stock<00:01:56.969> base<00:01:57.509> and

00:01:58.489 --> 00:01:58.499 
got a five by five card stock base and

00:01:58.499 --> 00:02:02.179 
got a five by five card stock base and
so<00:01:58.770> that<00:01:59.009> gives<00:01:59.249> me<00:01:59.459> a<00:01:59.609> starting<00:02:00.539> point<00:02:01.189> you

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
so that gives me a starting point you

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:05.719 
so that gives me a starting point you
might<00:02:02.399> notice<00:02:02.729> too<00:02:03.329> that<00:02:03.359> the<00:02:04.350> card<00:02:04.709> itself<00:02:04.950> is

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
might notice too that the card itself is

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:10.309 
might notice too that the card itself is
a<00:02:06.479> darker<00:02:07.610> color<00:02:08.610> that<00:02:09.119> hers<00:02:09.390> was<00:02:09.420> which<00:02:10.200> I

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
a darker color that hers was which I

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:11.059 
a darker color that hers was which I
thought<00:02:10.530> that's<00:02:10.740> what

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
thought that's what

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.459 
thought that's what
hey<00:02:11.189> I<00:02:11.219> kind<00:02:11.760> of<00:02:11.879> like<00:02:11.939> really<00:02:12.329> rich<00:02:12.629> tones<00:02:13.109> and

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:13.469 
hey I kind of like really rich tones and

00:02:13.469 --> 00:02:16.459 
hey I kind of like really rich tones and
Hughes<00:02:13.799> so<00:02:14.159> I<00:02:14.459> grabbed<00:02:15.269> a<00:02:15.420> little<00:02:15.629> bit<00:02:15.749> deeper

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:16.469 
Hughes so I grabbed a little bit deeper

00:02:16.469 --> 00:02:19.670 
Hughes so I grabbed a little bit deeper
tone<00:02:17.010> to<00:02:17.370> go<00:02:17.519> with<00:02:17.700> my<00:02:17.939> card<00:02:18.299> now<00:02:19.200> I<00:02:19.230> didn't

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
tone to go with my card now I didn't

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.940 
tone to go with my card now I didn't
have<00:02:19.950> these<00:02:20.310> specific<00:02:21.379> snowflakes<00:02:22.379> that<00:02:22.560> he

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
have these specific snowflakes that he

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.660 
have these specific snowflakes that he
had<00:02:23.400> here<00:02:23.730> but<00:02:24.239> I<00:02:24.269> do<00:02:24.389> have<00:02:24.749> some<00:02:25.019> pretty<00:02:25.230> cool

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
had here but I do have some pretty cool

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.699 
had here but I do have some pretty cool
punches<00:02:26.670> and<00:02:27.299> so<00:02:27.719> I<00:02:27.810> thought<00:02:28.019> I'm<00:02:28.260> just<00:02:28.319> going

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
punches and so I thought I'm just going

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:33.009 
punches and so I thought I'm just going
to<00:02:28.769> use<00:02:28.980> those<00:02:29.310> punches<00:02:30.200> instead<00:02:31.200> of<00:02:31.409> the<00:02:31.920> I

00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:33.019 
to use those punches instead of the I

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:36.080 
to use those punches instead of the I
think<00:02:34.019> these<00:02:34.170> are<00:02:34.230> stickers<00:02:34.650> that<00:02:34.859> she<00:02:35.430> has<00:02:35.760> so

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
think these are stickers that she has so

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:44.000 
think these are stickers that she has so
I'm<00:02:36.180> going<00:02:36.389> to<00:02:36.420> touch<00:02:38.299> right<00:02:39.299> here<00:02:41.930> and<00:02:43.010> then

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
I'm going to touch right here and then

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:48.349 
I'm going to touch right here and then
another<00:02:44.280> smaller<00:02:45.150> one<00:02:46.639> now<00:02:47.639> you<00:02:47.700> may<00:02:47.939> not<00:02:48.120> have

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:48.359 
another smaller one now you may not have

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:50.179 
another smaller one now you may not have
these<00:02:48.510> exact<00:02:48.900> bunches<00:02:49.379> too<00:02:49.409> but<00:02:49.799> maybe<00:02:49.980> you

00:02:50.179 --> 00:02:50.189 
these exact bunches too but maybe you

00:02:50.189 --> 00:02:52.009 
these exact bunches too but maybe you
can<00:02:50.400> figure<00:02:50.760> out<00:02:50.939> a<00:02:51.090> sticker<00:02:51.540> or<00:02:51.750> something

and<00:04:35.389> then<00:04:35.689> she<00:04:35.930> does<00:04:36.110> just<00:04:36.139> some<00:04:36.559> nice<00:04:36.800> little

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:37.900 
and then she does just some nice little

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:41.799 
and then she does just some nice little
edges<00:04:38.900> there<00:04:39.199> so<00:04:39.439> I'm<00:04:39.529> going<00:04:39.740> to<00:04:40.539> cut<00:04:41.539> it<00:04:41.659> at<00:04:41.779> a

00:04:41.799 --> 00:04:41.809 
edges there so I'm going to cut it at a

00:04:41.809 --> 00:04:43.749 
edges there so I'm going to cut it at a
slant<00:04:42.199> that<00:04:42.589> gives<00:04:42.800> it<00:04:42.949> kind<00:04:43.189> of<00:04:43.279> an<00:04:43.399> elegant

00:04:43.749 --> 00:04:43.759 
slant that gives it kind of an elegant

00:04:43.759 --> 00:04:56.049 
slant that gives it kind of an elegant
look<00:04:52.719> okay<00:04:53.719> so<00:04:54.349> now<00:04:54.680> we're<00:04:54.919> coming<00:04:55.069> down<00:04:55.249> to

00:04:56.049 --> 00:04:56.059 
look okay so now we're coming down to
