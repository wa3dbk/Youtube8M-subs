00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.360 
thought of making is on some of the pack
a<00:02:14.390> punch<00:02:14.780> machines<00:02:15.260> not<00:02:15.740> just<00:02:15.980> the<00:02:16.160> coke

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
a punch machines not just the coke

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:19.780 
a punch machines not just the coke
bottle<00:02:16.730> but<00:02:16.910> the<00:02:17.000> machines<00:02:17.390> themselves<00:02:18.790> my

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
bottle but the machines themselves my

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:21.580 
bottle but the machines themselves my
first<00:02:20.030> one<00:02:20.210> i<00:02:20.300> was<00:02:20.330> thinking<00:02:20.780> of<00:02:20.870> making<00:02:21.080> was

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590 
first one i was thinking of making was

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:25.090 
first one i was thinking of making was
the<00:02:21.920> PhD<00:02:22.550> flopper<00:02:23.500> actually<00:02:24.500> found<00:02:24.740> out<00:02:24.920> how

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:25.100 
the PhD flopper actually found out how

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:26.650 
the PhD flopper actually found out how
all<00:02:25.130> the<00:02:25.460> things<00:02:25.640> going<00:02:25.760> to<00:02:26.000> be<00:02:26.120> and<00:02:26.330> i<00:02:26.450> have

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
all the things going to be and i have

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:28.570 
all the things going to be and i have
the<00:02:26.840> materials<00:02:27.410> for<00:02:27.470> it<00:02:27.740> actually<00:02:28.430> won't

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
the materials for it actually won't

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:29.830 
the materials for it actually won't
really<00:02:28.850> be<00:02:28.940> that<00:02:29.180> hard<00:02:29.360> because<00:02:29.540> it's<00:02:29.780> just

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
really be that hard because it's just

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.760 
really be that hard because it's just
pretty<00:02:30.230> much<00:02:30.410> big<00:02:31.010> square<00:02:31.340> box<00:02:32.020> so<00:02:33.020> i'm

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:33.770 
pretty much big square box so i'm

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:35.110 
pretty much big square box so i'm
actually<00:02:33.920> going<00:02:34.220> to<00:02:34.310> be<00:02:34.370> making<00:02:34.730> some<00:02:34.910> of<00:02:34.970> the

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
actually going to be making some of the

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:36.700 
actually going to be making some of the
perk<00:02:35.330> machines<00:02:35.750> probably<00:02:36.230> making<00:02:36.410> quick

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:36.710 
perk machines probably making quick

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:39.990 
perk machines probably making quick
revive<00:02:37.010> and<00:02:37.400> i'm<00:02:37.460> probably<00:02:37.610> be<00:02:37.880> making<00:02:38.270> um

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
revive and i'm probably be making um

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.310 
revive and i'm probably be making um
speed<00:02:41.000> Cola<00:02:41.270> or<00:02:41.420> you're<00:02:41.900> diggin<00:02:42.200> I'd

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:42.320 
speed Cola or you're diggin I'd

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:44.890 
speed Cola or you're diggin I'd
something<00:02:42.830> like<00:02:42.920> that<00:02:43.130> not<00:02:43.480> every<00:02:44.480> single<00:02:44.780> one

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
something like that not every single one

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.130 
something like that not every single one
just<00:02:45.230> like<00:02:45.470> two<00:02:46.040> or<00:02:46.190> three<00:02:46.220> but<00:02:46.990> the<00:02:47.990> reason

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
just like two or three but the reason

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:50.260 
just like two or three but the reason
why<00:02:48.410> making<00:02:48.920> those<00:02:49.070> is<00:02:49.460> that<00:02:49.820> I've<00:02:50.000> actually

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:50.270 
why making those is that I've actually

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:54.460 
why making those is that I've actually
decided<00:02:50.600> on<00:02:51.260> making<00:02:51.890> a<00:02:52.900> real-life<00:02:53.900> nazi

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 
decided on making a real-life nazi

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:57.100 
decided on making a real-life nazi
zombie<00:02:54.830> moving<00:02:55.250> and<00:02:55.370> using<00:02:55.640> all<00:02:55.790> these<00:02:56.120> right

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:57.110 
zombie moving and using all these right

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:03.670 
zombie moving and using all these right
on<00:02:57.350> winter<00:02:58.070> towel<00:02:58.340> all<00:02:58.760> those<00:02:59.330> as<00:03:02.290> props<00:03:03.290> for

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 
on winter towel all those as props for

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:07.600 
on winter towel all those as props for
