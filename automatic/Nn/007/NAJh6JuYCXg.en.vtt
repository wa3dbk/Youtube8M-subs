00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:54.290 
port why would a sniffs need an internet

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:56.550 
port why would a sniffs need an internet
connection<00:00:54.350> I'll<00:00:55.130> get<00:00:55.400> to<00:00:55.520> that<00:00:55.550> in<00:00:55.700> a<00:00:55.910> moment

been wired and programs to work as an
emulator<00:02:13.240> we<00:02:14.140> couldn't<00:02:14.410> quite<00:02:14.470> figure<00:02:14.740> out

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
emulator we couldn't quite figure out

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:17.100 
emulator we couldn't quite figure out
how<00:02:15.160> to<00:02:15.220> get<00:02:15.400> the<00:02:15.520> power<00:02:15.760> thing<00:02:16.150> to<00:02:16.360> work<00:02:16.540> what

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
how to get the power thing to work what

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:20.100 
how to get the power thing to work what
how<00:02:17.200> we<00:02:17.260> want<00:02:17.560> it<00:02:17.680> so<00:02:17.860> it's<00:02:18.490> still<00:02:18.610> a<00:02:19.000> USB<00:02:19.810> port

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
how we want it so it's still a USB port

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:23.520 
how we want it so it's still a USB port
and<00:02:20.320> it<00:02:20.800> comes<00:02:21.100> out<00:02:21.250> of<00:02:21.310> the<00:02:21.460> side<00:02:22.080> the<00:02:23.080> USB

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
and it comes out of the side the USB

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:26.150 
and it comes out of the side the USB
ports<00:02:23.860> are<00:02:24.280> so<00:02:24.460> that<00:02:24.610> you<00:02:24.700> can<00:02:24.880> use<00:02:25.150> almost<00:02:25.750> any

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
ports are so that you can use almost any

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.570 
ports are so that you can use almost any
USB<00:02:27.270> controller<00:02:28.440> even<00:02:29.440> different<00:02:29.980> ones<00:02:30.130> like

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.580 
USB controller even different ones like

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:32.400 
USB controller even different ones like
player<00:02:30.850> one<00:02:31.090> could<00:02:31.300> use<00:02:31.420> this<00:02:31.660> for<00:02:31.930> a<00:02:31.960> classic

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:32.410 
player one could use this for a classic

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:36.090 
player one could use this for a classic
feel<00:02:32.590> and<00:02:33.990> player<00:02:34.990> two<00:02:35.200> could<00:02:35.440> use<00:02:35.470> this<00:02:35.770> for<00:02:36.070> a

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:36.100 
feel and player two could use this for a

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:39.120 
feel and player two could use this for a
more<00:02:36.280> modern<00:02:36.610> feel<00:02:36.850> but<00:02:37.120> sadly<00:02:38.080> 360<00:02:38.740> and<00:02:38.860> ps3

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130 
more modern feel but sadly 360 and ps3

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:43.620 
more modern feel but sadly 360 and ps3
controllers<00:02:39.670> don't<00:02:39.850> work<00:02:42.330> now<00:02:43.330> with<00:02:43.390> the

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:43.630 
controllers don't work now with the

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:45.450 
controllers don't work now with the

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:45.460 
camera pointed at the telly use what it

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:47.640 
camera pointed at the telly use what it
looks<00:02:45.820> like<00:02:46.090> when<00:02:46.690> it's<00:02:46.840> booting<00:02:47.230> this<00:02:47.470> is<00:02:47.590> the

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
looks like when it's booting this is the

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:49.500 
looks like when it's booting this is the
Sega<00:02:47.890> Genesis<00:02:48.250> cartridge<00:02:48.400> so<00:02:49.180> why<00:02:49.300> does<00:02:49.450> it

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
Sega Genesis cartridge so why does it

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.480 
Sega Genesis cartridge so why does it
need<00:02:49.690> an<00:02:49.810> Ethernet<00:02:50.320> port<00:02:50.350> well<00:02:51.010> because

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:51.490 
need an Ethernet port well because

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:53.580 
need an Ethernet port well because
that's<00:02:52.000> how<00:02:52.270> you<00:02:52.330> get<00:02:52.540> the<00:02:52.660> roms<00:02:52.870> you<00:02:53.350> can't

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
that's how you get the roms you can't

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:56.100 
that's how you get the roms you can't
plug<00:02:54.130> in<00:02:54.340> the<00:02:54.460> cartridges<00:02:55.120> into<00:02:55.510> a<00:02:55.630> computer

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110 
plug in the cartridges into a computer

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:58.890 
plug in the cartridges into a computer
and<00:02:56.410> just<00:02:56.440> transfer<00:02:57.370> files<00:02:57.790> over<00:02:58.060> you<00:02:58.540> have<00:02:58.720> to

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
and just transfer files over you have to

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:02.370 
and just transfer files over you have to
use<00:02:59.080> SCP<00:02:59.709> going<00:03:00.280> through<00:03:00.690> Ethernet<00:03:01.690> supports

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:02.380 
use SCP going through Ethernet supports

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:04.199 
use SCP going through Ethernet supports
so<00:03:03.010> here's<00:03:03.160> the<00:03:03.310> menu<00:03:03.459> with<00:03:03.790> the<00:03:03.970> vast

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:04.209 
so here's the menu with the vast

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:07.590 
so here's the menu with the vast
majority<00:03:04.870> of<00:03:04.990> Sega<00:03:05.350> Genesis<00:03:05.740> games<00:03:06.390> note<00:03:07.390> I'm

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:07.600 
majority of Sega Genesis games note I'm

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:12.650 
majority of Sega Genesis games note I'm
playing<00:03:07.930> with<00:03:08.140> a<00:03:08.200> Super<00:03:08.739> Nintendo<00:03:08.830> controller

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:16.229 

and<00:03:13.660> let's<00:03:14.500> play<00:03:14.739> Sonic<00:03:15.130> 3<00:03:15.430> because<00:03:15.850> I<00:03:15.880> love

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:16.239 
and let's play Sonic 3 because I love

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:20.460 
and let's play Sonic 3 because I love
that<00:03:16.420> game<00:03:17.250> and<00:03:18.510> as<00:03:19.510> you<00:03:19.660> can<00:03:19.780> see<00:03:19.840> there's<00:03:20.260> no

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.470 
that game and as you can see there's no

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:23.010 
that game and as you can see there's no
framerate<00:03:20.800> issues<00:03:21.070> the<00:03:22.000> only<00:03:22.270> problem<00:03:22.900> I've

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:23.020 
framerate issues the only problem I've

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:24.570 
framerate issues the only problem I've
really<00:03:23.290> had<00:03:23.500> was<00:03:23.709> with<00:03:23.830> Donkey<00:03:24.160> Kong<00:03:24.340> Country

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:24.580 
really had was with Donkey Kong Country

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:26.520 
really had was with Donkey Kong Country
and<00:03:25.090> that<00:03:25.450> was<00:03:25.600> just<00:03:25.780> that<00:03:25.930> the<00:03:26.140> audio<00:03:26.440> was

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.530 
and that was just that the audio was

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:28.320 
and that was just that the audio was
off-key<00:03:27.100> so<00:03:27.489> the<00:03:27.610> way<00:03:27.700> I<00:03:27.730> did<00:03:28.000> this<00:03:28.120> with<00:03:28.300> the

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:28.330 
off-key so the way I did this with the

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:30.870 
off-key so the way I did this with the
cartridges<00:03:28.810> and<00:03:28.989> everything<00:03:29.320> is<00:03:29.880> unnecessary

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:30.880

I<00:03:31.120> only<00:03:31.630> did<00:03:31.840> it<00:03:31.870> as<00:03:32.110> a<00:03:32.140> little<00:03:32.470> extra<00:03:33.040> fun

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 
I only did it as a little extra fun

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:35.580 
I only did it as a little extra fun
