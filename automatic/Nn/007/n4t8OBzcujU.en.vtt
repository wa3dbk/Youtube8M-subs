00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.960
 just follow as they are vÃ­ctor managers and 

00:00:04.609 --> 00:00:09.570
 we are going to 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:13.350
 I'm looking to teach how to make portions of 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:15.720
 jump and somersault of these super 

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:18.180
 super cool you are going to see the ones that 

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:20.220
 be super cool options and good for 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.340
 All we need is the 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:26.070
 world that regenerates so much this 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:30.060
 from the base to the lava we have and such and 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.320
 which good and I'll show you how as 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.300
 do these positions basically what 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.489
 what we need are rabbits I have caught 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.040
 of the creative as the rabbits' broadsword 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:41.300
 to kill them and get what 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:45.000
 we need this is that they are the 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:48.250
 rabbit food we sit on the feet of 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.230
 rabbit so good 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:53.860
 we go there of choco and I learn by day 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:56.890
 because times &amp; day because if they do not go to 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:58.840
 appear a lot of enemy maps and not 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:01.239
 I want that so well, a little bit 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:02.920
 marc let's see let's apply to 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:04.210
 potent potion support for 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.310
 start we need a support for 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:08.860
 we need some bottles that 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:11.320
 I have left them, I have left because 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:13.840
 look if it's that smart today, let's just leave 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:16.000
 see I'm going to catch it first like with 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:18.040
 water and then the bottles jars are 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.740
 flame night vials jars indeed 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:22.869
 I'm going to take the subject with good water 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:27.420
 is so you do not take them I'm going to 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:27.420
 do also so you do not say 

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:31.540
 we need water that I already have 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:33.190
 here is that you do not need the cube then 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:36.369
 what we need are jars of 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:38.619
 crystal that are obtained with crystal 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:40.840
 we put for example I'm going to explain it 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:42.580
 better because if we do not already imagine 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.680
 that this is crystal vale is the jar 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:47.080
 these flasks smiles because we put 1 2 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:49.600
 3 and in this way we will get three 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:52.450
 glass bottles that are in these 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:56.439
 here and then we fill them 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:58.210
 23 we put them here 1 2 3 we put it 

00:01:56.439 --> 00:02:01.600
 the infernal wart that is obtained in 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:04.509
 the leader and we wait for you to tell 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:06.100
 this ends and as soon as I finish 

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:09.099
 we have to place the rabbit 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:10.899
 this will give us a salt option or 

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:14.380
 gives us let's say the characteristics of a 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:16.870
 of a rabbit and we can jump so that 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.400
 I see, it's not cool a lot because, in fact, 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.140
 I think you could not create before 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.599
 also not having tried to create but 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:25.660
 I think they can not be created in the man 

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:27.790
 create 1.7 already earlier so it has very 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:31.120
 good looking let's go there I think already 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:32.349
 I'm there is here we put support or 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.299
 be first we have to put the wart 

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:36.670
 infernal has to be everything in order 

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:39.099
 first infernal wart then foot of 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:41.290
 rabbit and then well can we go to 

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:43.299
 change or we can put redstone or 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:45.220
 luminous stone dust or also 

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:47.950
 we can put gunpowder to make them 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.569
 explayÃ³ be it splashes before good sometimes 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:51.790
 they have been done as you see here already puts 

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:53.440
 three minute high jump we're going to 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:56.410
 doing this would give us the high jump to 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:58.739
 three minutes if we put him dexton do not 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:58.739
 can 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:03.130
 put redstone therefore pick up one 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:05.370
 therefore if you can not put network 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:08.430
 this can not lengthen its duration 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:11.760
 friend are three minutes 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:13.140
 in three minutes with high jump and 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.269
 then with network are good to know that in 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:16.709
 theory has to be better that's the 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:18.659
 potions philosophy what happens not 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:21.060
 I know it's really that jumping 

00:03:18.659 --> 00:03:22.769
 two high theory are better or is 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:25.680
 that would jump is more with them to see no 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:27.659
 it may be weird and this yes yes with 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:29.099
 resistance and with knowing what's going good and 

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:31.200
 while we are going to take the portion of 

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:34.319
 come out and go and see what this is going to be 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:37.349
 a festival or you see that it is the 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:40.790
 jumps from death to and is that 

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:43.200
 my mother, my mother. 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:44.579
 guacho to the only thing missing that I do not 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:47.909
 I have damage from falling because my mother 

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:50.939
 ok and in theory is when you put him 

00:03:47.909 --> 00:03:52.680
 redstone returns to its lower level than 

00:03:50.939 --> 00:03:56.760
 it's high high but three minutes like that 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:58.640
 that I'm going to take from creative a a cube 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:01.700
 of milk 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:02.750
 milk there is milk and we are going to take 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:04.790
 a little milk to remove the 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:06.800
 effects of jump position 2 of 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:09.380
 this one that you jump so much 

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:12.110
 there they are and we are going to take the one we 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:13.970
 you jump so much that it's 3 minutes 63 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:16.040
 minutes of high jump and as you see 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:18.230
 is our card is to tell us high 

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:20.870
 so much but even so it's about 

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:22.490
 I jump more than my mother kid 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:23.720
 jumps that you hit and then these 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:26.390
 lasts three minutes and the truth is that 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:27.770
 thank you very much there are some guys with 

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:29.090
 I say goodbye, I hope that I have 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:32.330
 served this tutorial on how to do 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:33.590
 portions of high jump assigned if 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:35.240
 It has been like that to leave a position 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:38.030
 like to subscribe to the channel for more 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:39.710
 videos as they exist and nothing a greeting to 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:42.730
 everyone and see you in the next video 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:42.730
 until then
