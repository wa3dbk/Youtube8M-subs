00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 Talking galley on channel on skateboard 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:05.609
 What are you talking about? Guilherme opened four 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:11.250
 maneuvers in the air today show you 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:16.400
 how to send a flip but a backside 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.400
 ollie the two together a backflip 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:23.850
 So, guys, send me a backside flip. 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.470
 just like the backside ollie when you 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.260
 hold you might start 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:31.080
 making it reverses is then deprived 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.570
 You'll send the felipe that can catch 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.520
 in the front and finish turning on the floor makes 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.070
 the right way is you go there all in the 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.260
 air because the pivot will serve you. 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.090
 to him on the floor or from him to climb in some 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.739
 obstacle but if you go down one 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.780
 ladder for example has no quality and 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.090
 I'll stay the impact if you want to 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.550
 The team will end up harming me 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.449
 then the easiest way 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.699
 correct 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.199
 You will get enough strength to play the 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.420
 egg and kick the flip 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:00.030
 every time you make a move 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.680
 backside ollie when you are 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.300
 feeling more or less is just the flip 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.939
 just like Felipe 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.900
 there in the initial eleven will already begin to rotate 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.720
 in the air 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.490
 it will complete the 180graus and you already 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.640
 will have turned all your base and will 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.409
 fall on him show but have now 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:19.200
 the front of the flip just behind the 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:23.330
 screws back full well in the middle plays 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.330
 this arm along with the egg and kick flip 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:36.420
 manoel felipe beck is you 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.520
 think about the backside ollie and when 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.189
 start spinning you're flip as well 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.200
 strong out is there at eleven stretches 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:45.450
 your foot and that your body is already 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.180
 turning and you walking back when he 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.460
 complete 180 c coupe here but the most 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.320
 important is to play hard with both the 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.759
 back foot as time arriving at 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.799
 time to kick the flip hits hard 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:57.659
 ollie backside to turn everything in the air 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.500
 to come to 180graus in haiti and on time 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:01.229
 that he's been here for more or less 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.450
 passing from 45 degrees chuck flip null 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:07.490
 Super show out there he'll be 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.490
 all dry the bases 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:33.150

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.470
