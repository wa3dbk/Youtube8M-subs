hey<00:00:01.020> so<00:00:01.770> here's<00:00:01.979> a<00:00:02.070> project<00:00:02.490> that<00:00:02.520> I've<00:00:02.669> been

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:02.700 
hey so here's a project that I've been

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:04.309 
hey so here's a project that I've been
working<00:00:02.879> on<00:00:03.149> for<00:00:03.389> the<00:00:03.510> last<00:00:03.570> couple<00:00:03.929> of<00:00:04.140> months

00:00:04.309 --> 00:00:04.319 
working on for the last couple of months

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:07.309 
working on for the last couple of months
I<00:00:04.680> spent<00:00:05.220> some<00:00:05.609> time<00:00:05.670> in<00:00:06.180> classrooms<00:00:06.839> teaching

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:07.319 
I spent some time in classrooms teaching

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:09.530 
I spent some time in classrooms teaching
fifth<00:00:07.649> graders<00:00:07.980> had<00:00:08.429> a<00:00:08.460> program<00:00:08.940> using<00:00:09.179> Lego

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
fifth graders had a program using Lego

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.080 
fifth graders had a program using Lego
robotics<00:00:09.809> and<00:00:10.349> when<00:00:11.099> I<00:00:11.130> had<00:00:11.340> them<00:00:11.519> write<00:00:11.790> down

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
robotics and when I had them write down

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:13.820 
robotics and when I had them write down
the<00:00:12.420> commands<00:00:12.929> they<00:00:13.049> wanted<00:00:13.349> the<00:00:13.440> robot<00:00:13.799> to

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
the commands they wanted the robot to

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.829 
the commands they wanted the robot to
complete<00:00:14.340> on<00:00:14.549> a<00:00:14.610> physical<00:00:15.179> piece<00:00:15.420> of<00:00:15.660> paper

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
complete on a physical piece of paper

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.670 
complete on a physical piece of paper
they<00:00:16.440> had<00:00:16.650> no<00:00:17.130> problem<00:00:17.660> but<00:00:18.660> when<00:00:19.199> I<00:00:19.230> wanted

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
they had no problem but when I wanted

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.890 
they had no problem but when I wanted
them<00:00:19.800> to<00:00:19.890> transfer<00:00:20.160> those<00:00:20.430> commands<00:00:21.060> onto<00:00:21.810> the

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
them to transfer those commands onto the

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.929 
them to transfer those commands onto the
computer<00:00:22.439> so<00:00:23.160> that<00:00:23.189> they<00:00:23.430> could<00:00:23.550> program<00:00:23.760> the

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
computer so that they could program the

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.870 
computer so that they could program the
robot<00:00:24.240> lots<00:00:25.140> of<00:00:25.350> problems<00:00:25.560> came<00:00:25.949> up<00:00:26.160> so<00:00:26.849> I

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
robot lots of problems came up so I

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.790 
robot lots of problems came up so I
thought<00:00:27.119> to<00:00:27.240> myself<00:00:27.269> what<00:00:28.140> if<00:00:28.260> I<00:00:28.349> could<00:00:28.500> create

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
thought to myself what if I could create

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.120 
thought to myself what if I could create
a<00:00:29.070> physical<00:00:29.640> way<00:00:29.820> to<00:00:30.300> program<00:00:30.750> so<00:00:31.740> basically

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
a physical way to program so basically

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.610 
a physical way to program so basically
combined<00:00:32.579> two<00:00:32.820> technologies<00:00:33.180> one<00:00:33.870> this<00:00:34.290> Lego

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
combined two technologies one this Lego

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.860 
combined two technologies one this Lego
NXT<00:00:34.820> the<00:00:35.820> robotics<00:00:36.300> that<00:00:36.420> I<00:00:36.450> use<00:00:36.660> in<00:00:36.809> the

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
NXT the robotics that I use in the

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.080 
NXT the robotics that I use in the
classroom<00:00:36.989> which<00:00:37.950> basically<00:00:38.280> consists<00:00:38.790> of<00:00:38.910> a

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
classroom which basically consists of a

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.450 
classroom which basically consists of a
center<00:00:39.420> console<00:00:39.809> the<00:00:40.200> brain<00:00:40.440> and<00:00:40.710> here<00:00:41.340> I<00:00:41.370> have

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
center console the brain and here I have

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.220 
center console the brain and here I have
just<00:00:41.760> one<00:00:41.969> simple<00:00:42.270> motor<00:00:42.570> and<00:00:42.899> a<00:00:43.680> light<00:00:43.860> sensor

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:45.230 
just one simple motor and a light sensor

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:49.850 
just one simple motor and a light sensor
with<00:00:46.230> sift<00:00:46.829> EO<00:00:47.010> cubes<00:00:48.170> and<00:00:49.170> what<00:00:49.320> these<00:00:49.469> guys

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
with sift EO cubes and what these guys

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.400 
with sift EO cubes and what these guys
are<00:00:49.920> is<00:00:50.340> small<00:00:50.700> cubes<00:00:51.059> that<00:00:51.210> you<00:00:51.930> can<00:00:52.079> push<00:00:52.289> an

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
are is small cubes that you can push an

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.229 
are is small cubes that you can push an
image<00:00:52.680> to<00:00:52.829> their<00:00:52.949> screen<00:00:53.250> there's<00:00:53.730> a<00:00:53.940> single

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
image to their screen there's a single

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.720 
image to their screen there's a single
button<00:00:54.539> they<00:00:55.260> can<00:00:55.440> tell<00:00:55.710> their<00:00:55.739> orientation

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
button they can tell their orientation

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.479 
button they can tell their orientation
and<00:00:56.960> their<00:00:57.960> relation<00:00:58.440> with<00:00:58.590> other<00:00:58.770> cubes<00:00:59.190> and

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
and their relation with other cubes and

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.180 
and their relation with other cubes and
so<00:01:00.270> I<00:01:00.300> basically<00:01:00.510> combine<00:01:01.079> this<00:01:01.289> to<00:01:01.680> create<00:01:01.949> an

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
so I basically combine this to create an

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.020 
so I basically combine this to create an
awesome<00:01:02.760> physical<00:01:03.510> way<00:01:03.660> to<00:01:03.719> program<00:01:04.519> so<00:01:05.519> you

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
awesome physical way to program so you

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.840 
awesome physical way to program so you
basically<00:01:06.240> click<00:01:06.720> the<00:01:06.900> button<00:01:07.670> to<00:01:08.670> toggle

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
basically click the button to toggle

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.760 
basically click the button to toggle
through<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.479> commands<00:01:09.900> I<00:01:10.020> have<00:01:10.229> a<00:01:10.260> forward

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
through the commands I have a forward

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.980 
through the commands I have a forward
command<00:01:11.130> a<00:01:11.250> backwards<00:01:11.670> command<00:01:12.119> a<00:01:12.360> wait

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
command a backwards command a wait

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.580 
command a backwards command a wait
command<00:01:13.530> stop<00:01:14.250> command<00:01:14.790> and<00:01:15.229> also<00:01:16.229> using<00:01:16.560> the

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
command stop command and also using the

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.679 
command stop command and also using the
light<00:01:16.799> sensor<00:01:17.159> I<00:01:17.189> have<00:01:17.400> a<00:01:17.430> wait<00:01:17.729> for<00:01:17.970> it<00:01:18.060> seeing

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
light sensor I have a wait for it seeing

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.840 
light sensor I have a wait for it seeing
brighter<00:01:19.229> and<00:01:19.470> a<00:01:19.619> wait<00:01:19.770> for<00:01:19.979> seeing<00:01:20.189> darker<00:01:20.580> so

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
brighter and a wait for seeing darker so

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.300 
brighter and a wait for seeing darker so
first<00:01:21.180> let's<00:01:21.900> write<00:01:22.049> a<00:01:22.080> simple<00:01:22.320> program<00:01:22.439> let's

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
first let's write a simple program let's

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.640 
first let's write a simple program let's
make<00:01:23.430> it<00:01:23.460> go<00:01:23.610> forward<00:01:23.939> for<00:01:24.810> two<00:01:25.140> seconds<00:01:25.530> and

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
make it go forward for two seconds and

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.140 
make it go forward for two seconds and
how<00:01:25.830> you<00:01:25.890> change<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.280> time<00:01:26.490> as<00:01:26.700> you<00:01:26.850> flip<00:01:27.090> over

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
how you change the time as you flip over

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.410 
how you change the time as you flip over
any<00:01:27.450> cube<00:01:27.810> and<00:01:28.020> on<00:01:28.740> the<00:01:28.829> back<00:01:29.009> I<00:01:29.250> have<00:01:29.430> a<00:01:29.700> plus

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
any cube and on the back I have a plus

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.330 
any cube and on the back I have a plus
symbol<00:01:30.600> and<00:01:30.900> a<00:01:30.960> minus<00:01:31.140> symbol<00:01:31.409> and<00:01:31.680> then<00:01:32.250> you

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
symbol and a minus symbol and then you

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.510 
symbol and a minus symbol and then you
simply<00:01:32.490> push<00:01:33.090> them<00:01:33.210> together<00:01:33.360> to<00:01:33.540> add<00:01:33.840> time

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520 
simply push them together to add time

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.810 
simply push them together to add time
which<00:01:35.520> you<00:01:35.640> can<00:01:35.790> see<00:01:35.820> in<00:01:35.970> this<00:01:36.119> top<00:01:36.420> corner

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:37.820 
which you can see in this top corner

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:43.609 
which you can see in this top corner
then<00:01:38.820> let's<00:01:39.150> have<00:01:39.240> a<00:01:39.299> go<00:01:39.479> backwards<00:01:41.299> and<00:01:42.619> as

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
then let's have a go backwards and as

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:48.980 
then let's have a go backwards and as
you<00:01:44.100> can<00:01:44.220> see<00:01:44.250> two<00:01:44.820> seconds<00:01:45.240> and<00:01:46.820> then<00:01:47.990> after

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
you can see two seconds and then after

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.810 
you can see two seconds and then after
it<00:01:49.079> completes<00:01:49.500> those<00:01:49.829> two<00:01:50.130> commands<00:01:50.579> let's

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
it completes those two commands let's

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.319 
it completes those two commands let's
have<00:01:50.939> it<00:01:51.530> make<00:01:52.530> a<00:01:52.560> sound<00:01:52.649> so<00:01:53.310> to<00:01:53.369> recap<00:01:53.850> it

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
have it make a sound so to recap it

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.899 
have it make a sound so to recap it
should<00:01:54.540> go<00:01:54.710> forward<00:01:55.710> for<00:01:55.950> two<00:01:56.070> seconds<00:01:56.430> then

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
should go forward for two seconds then

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.730 
should go forward for two seconds then
backwards<00:01:57.420> for<00:01:57.570> two<00:01:57.659> seconds<00:01:58.020> and<00:01:58.170> then<00:01:58.560> make

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
backwards for two seconds and then make

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.590 
backwards for two seconds and then make
a<00:01:58.770> sound<00:01:58.979> and<00:01:59.219> so<00:01:59.850> if<00:01:59.909> you<00:01:59.969> push<00:02:00.180> them<00:02:00.420> in

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
a sound and so if you push them in

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.649 
a sound and so if you push them in
together<00:02:01.140> in<00:02:01.500> the<00:02:01.619> desire<00:02:01.920> to<00:02:01.950> order<00:02:02.490> and<00:02:02.670> then

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
together in the desire to order and then

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.600 
together in the desire to order and then
the<00:02:04.049> screen<00:02:04.259> comes<00:02:04.530> up<00:02:04.680> saying<00:02:04.890> click<00:02:05.369> to

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
the screen comes up saying click to

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:14.790 
the screen comes up saying click to
compile<00:02:05.969> so<00:02:06.570> when<00:02:06.689> I<00:02:06.719> click<00:02:06.840> it

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.250 

there<00:02:15.700> you<00:02:15.820> go<00:02:15.970> now<00:02:16.570> let's<00:02:16.750> write<00:02:16.870> a<00:02:16.900> little

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
there you go now let's write a little

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.530 
there you go now let's write a little
bit<00:02:17.470> more<00:02:17.740> complex<00:02:18.130> program<00:02:18.640> using<00:02:19.060> the<00:02:19.090> light

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
bit more complex program using the light

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.670 
bit more complex program using the light
sensor<00:02:19.960> and<00:02:20.430> this<00:02:21.430> piece<00:02:21.610> of<00:02:21.760> white<00:02:21.910> paper<00:02:22.680> so

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
sensor and this piece of white paper so

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.680 
sensor and this piece of white paper so
first<00:02:23.920> I<00:02:24.100> wanted<00:02:24.370> to<00:02:24.460> go<00:02:24.820> forward<00:02:25.270> which<00:02:25.600> is

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
first I wanted to go forward which is

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:30.420 
first I wanted to go forward which is
already<00:02:25.780> on<00:02:25.930> that<00:02:26.020> command<00:02:27.180> and<00:02:29.070> then<00:02:30.070> we're

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
already on that command and then we're

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:34.400 
already on that command and then we're
going<00:02:30.520> to<00:02:30.580> have<00:02:30.760> it<00:02:30.910> wait<00:02:31.270> until<00:02:31.600> it<00:02:32.530> sees

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
going to have it wait until it sees

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.660 
going to have it wait until it sees
something<00:02:35.410> brighter<00:02:35.710> so<00:02:36.130> this<00:02:36.280> command<00:02:36.550> would

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
something brighter so this command would

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:39.990 
something brighter so this command would
say<00:02:36.970> keep<00:02:37.720> doing<00:02:38.140> what<00:02:38.290> it's<00:02:38.410> doing<00:02:38.470> until<00:02:39.430> the

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
say keep doing what it's doing until the

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.060 
say keep doing what it's doing until the
light<00:02:40.270> sensor<00:02:40.660> sees<00:02:40.840> a<00:02:40.900> brighter<00:02:41.350> surface<00:02:41.860> and

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:42.070 
light sensor sees a brighter surface and

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:45.090 
light sensor sees a brighter surface and
then<00:02:43.230> again<00:02:44.230> we'll<00:02:44.410> have<00:02:44.500> to<00:02:44.590> go<00:02:44.710> backwards

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:45.100 
then again we'll have to go backwards

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:47.700 
then again we'll have to go backwards
for<00:02:45.280> two<00:02:45.400> seconds<00:02:45.810> so<00:02:46.810> if<00:02:46.900> you<00:02:46.990> put<00:02:47.170> them<00:02:47.320> in<00:02:47.560> a

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:47.710 
for two seconds so if you put them in a

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:50.370 
for two seconds so if you put them in a
desired<00:02:48.010> order<00:02:48.600> where<00:02:49.600> should<00:02:49.690> go<00:02:49.870> forward

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:50.380 
desired order where should go forward

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:52.740 
desired order where should go forward
til<00:02:51.310> to<00:02:51.400> see<00:02:51.490> something<00:02:51.700> brighter<00:02:52.000> and<00:02:52.240> then

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:52.750 
til to see something brighter and then

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:55.800 
til to see something brighter and then
go<00:02:52.900> backwards<00:02:53.320> push<00:02:54.100> them<00:02:54.220> together<00:02:54.690> click<00:02:55.690> to

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810 
go backwards push them together click to

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:05.370 
go backwards push them together click to
compile<00:03:01.530> and<00:03:03.060> there<00:03:04.060> you<00:03:04.150> have<00:03:04.180> it<00:03:04.360> I<00:03:04.660> think

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:05.380 
compile and there you have it I think

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:08.190 
compile and there you have it I think
this<00:03:05.560> physical<00:03:06.250> way<00:03:06.430> of<00:03:06.760> programming<00:03:07.390> will<00:03:07.870> be

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200 
this physical way of programming will be

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.830 
this physical way of programming will be
far<00:03:08.890> easier<00:03:09.220> for<00:03:09.790> children<00:03:10.180> to<00:03:10.270> pick<00:03:10.480> up<00:03:10.630> and

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
far easier for children to pick up and

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:21.750 
far easier for children to pick up and
excel<00:03:11.680> at<00:03:12.150> thank<00:03:13.150> you

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.760 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:23.819 

you
