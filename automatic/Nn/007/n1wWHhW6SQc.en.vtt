00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:17.490
 We tweet with the problem litter with 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:22.320
 sugar water I already have sugar water 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:24.960
 that is one to one means one 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:28.289
 part water part sugar I 've got 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:31.080
 Now about a kilo in weight that almost 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:35.390
 in 500 milliliters of water and 500 grams 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:38.100
 sugar I take one to one 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:40.320
 Mixing ratio because must lingers 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.360
 wait a bit longer and build up 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:51.390
 that promotes that soon need to know what 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:53.309
 store and what do we need to me 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:57.510
 do that with pleasure to feed 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:01:01.829
 ratio the bees can down here 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:05.540
 purely need here a steak up 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:09.150
 and then come here to the sugar water 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:12.420
 the whole is closed off by plexiglas 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:15.270
 So do not drown think the lid 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:19.409
 make the cover on the top up 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:24.000
 the whole thing comes on a slide drum 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:26.750
 around empty days even we have the 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.430
 leher the film days have to get me now 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:30.780
 and in the very nice weather it was 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.590
 we have chosen today 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:37.229
 a really good smoker I hope 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:40.229
 they do not drive me that hard 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.400
 I'm here only briefly and 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.939
 after all, they also get something to eat 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.939
 from me 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.750
 One day I did not choose it 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:51.579
 It does not change since I have the week 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:54.189
 not much time and the bees have to 

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:56.649
 be fed because they have to first 

00:01:54.189 --> 00:02:01.110
 the food for breeding and you need 

00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:03.759
 the place to brood as I said with 121 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.590
 sugar water works best 

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:07.090
 that one brings the many to the 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:09.099
 to expand honeycomb were at the 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:11.410
 Bad weather, they find nothing 

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:14.610
 They do not like eating their food 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:18.040
 to advertise medium walls 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:21.360
 Well, we say of traded states that 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.360
 nokas mode can start 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:29.920
 So I try to hurry 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:31.810
 as I said there is not so good the date 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:35.019
 he probably is not pleased 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:45.010
 to see me give tidy it is 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:47.280
 a little contact possible with the bees 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:47.280
 to have 

00:03:28.639 --> 00:03:31.639
 to 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:58.280
 He has a slit on it 

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:13.350
 our food gets on it 

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:27.830
 fill in there quickly with sugar water 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:54.159
 still empty days on it 

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:14.229
 and cover it was faster 

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:16.030
 Intervention today is half an hour around 

00:05:14.229 --> 00:05:22.389
 and you look again just that 

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:24.210

00:05:22.389 --> 00:05:28.320
 The first bees have found their way 

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:28.320
 are already busy eating 

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:37.180
 now you can enter it diligently and 

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:39.520
 especially the middle walls expand as well 

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:44.980
 in the bad weather with it 

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:46.390
