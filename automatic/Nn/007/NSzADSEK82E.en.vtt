one<00:02:16.810> apart<00:02:17.050> as<00:02:17.319> well<00:02:18.720> looks<00:02:19.720> pretty<00:02:19.930> good<00:02:20.200> in

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
one apart as well looks pretty good in

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:21.960 
one apart as well looks pretty good in
the<00:02:20.440> packaging<00:02:20.950> I<00:02:21.040> have<00:02:21.190> to<00:02:21.340> say<00:02:21.489> so<00:02:21.550> even

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
the packaging I have to say so even

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.930 
the packaging I have to say so even
though<00:02:22.030> it's<00:02:22.180> a<00:02:22.209> couple<00:02:22.480> pieces<00:02:23.400> it<00:02:24.400> has<00:02:24.580> and

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
though it's a couple pieces it has and

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:26.100 
though it's a couple pieces it has and
you<00:02:24.970> might<00:02:25.030> be<00:02:25.180> wondering<00:02:25.300> what<00:02:25.690> this<00:02:25.840> paper

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
you might be wondering what this paper

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:30.930 
you might be wondering what this paper
so<00:02:26.950> let's<00:02:27.280> go<00:02:28.270> somewhere<00:02:28.840> in<00:02:29.110> here<00:02:29.760> what's<00:02:30.760> in

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
so let's go somewhere in here what's in

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:34.740 
so let's go somewhere in here what's in
here<00:02:32.550> once<00:02:33.550> you<00:02:33.700> open<00:02:33.850> this<00:02:34.090> up<00:02:34.330> you'll<00:02:34.600> have

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
here once you open this up you'll have

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:41.400 
here once you open this up you'll have
your<00:02:34.900> pieces<00:02:35.200> here<00:02:35.850> or<00:02:36.850> those<00:02:37.150> out<00:02:40.019> and<00:02:41.019> then

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:41.410 
your pieces here or those out and then

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:44.880 
your pieces here or those out and then
you<00:02:41.590> can<00:02:41.769> take<00:02:42.010> out<00:02:43.230> this<00:02:44.230> little<00:02:44.500> piece<00:02:44.739> of

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
you can take out this little piece of

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:48.690 
you can take out this little piece of
paper<00:02:45.130> and<00:02:46.590> might<00:02:47.590> be<00:02:47.739> thinking<00:02:48.220> if<00:02:48.400> I<00:02:48.519> don't

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
paper and might be thinking if I don't

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:49.949 
paper and might be thinking if I don't
have<00:02:48.850> the<00:02:48.970> directions<00:02:49.269> how<00:02:49.630> am<00:02:49.720> I<00:02:49.780> going<00:02:49.900> to

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:49.959 
have the directions how am I going to

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:52.830 
have the directions how am I going to
build<00:02:50.140> it<00:02:50.290> so<00:02:50.410> campus<00:02:50.799> it<00:02:50.980> well<00:02:51.670> you<00:02:52.150> unfold<00:02:52.660> it

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
build it so campus it well you unfold it

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.070 
build it so campus it well you unfold it
and<00:02:53.019> you<00:02:53.140> have<00:02:53.319> the<00:02:53.500> directions<00:02:53.769> right<00:02:54.160> there

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 
and you have the directions right there

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:59.930 
and you have the directions right there
on<00:02:56.080> how<00:02:56.290> to<00:02:56.350> build<00:02:56.560> it<00:02:56.799> so<00:02:57.310> it's<00:02:57.610> all<00:02:57.790> folded<00:02:58.180> up

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
on how to build it so it's all folded up

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.789 
on how to build it so it's all folded up
so<00:03:00.940> yeah<00:03:01.239> that's<00:03:01.450> just<00:03:01.600> watching<00:03:02.080> 15<00:03:02.410> inches<00:03:02.680> a

00:03:02.789 --> 00:03:02.799 
so yeah that's just watching 15 inches a

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:06.350 
so yeah that's just watching 15 inches a
little<00:03:03.040> bad<00:03:03.360> but<00:03:04.360> I<00:03:04.420> just<00:03:04.690> photocopied<00:03:05.500> it<00:03:05.620> and

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
little bad but I just photocopied it and

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:10.130 
little bad but I just photocopied it and
cut<00:03:07.360> it<00:03:07.390> I'm<00:03:07.600> out<00:03:07.780> so<00:03:08.170> I'm<00:03:08.500> cutting<00:03:09.069> them<00:03:09.580> out

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
cut it I'm out so I'm cutting them out

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.449 
cut it I'm out so I'm cutting them out
so<00:03:11.140> I<00:03:11.170> could<00:03:11.319> just<00:03:11.650> fit<00:03:11.799> them<00:03:11.920> in<00:03:12.040> these<00:03:12.190> little

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:12.459 
so I could just fit them in these little

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:15.870 
so I could just fit them in these little
plastic<00:03:13.060> baggies<00:03:13.630> and<00:03:14.310> shipping<00:03:15.310> these<00:03:15.580> guys

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:15.880 
plastic baggies and shipping these guys

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:19.170 
plastic baggies and shipping these guys
safer<00:03:16.600> and<00:03:16.810> better<00:03:17.220> so<00:03:18.220> that's<00:03:18.459> pretty<00:03:19.000> much

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:19.180 
safer and better so that's pretty much

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.690 
safer and better so that's pretty much
that<00:03:19.480> I<00:03:19.690> have<00:03:20.170> three<00:03:20.980> of<00:03:21.070> those<00:03:21.220> and<00:03:21.280> you'll

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:21.700 
that I have three of those and you'll

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:25.020 
that I have three of those and you'll
probably<00:03:21.910> see<00:03:22.239> something<00:03:22.480> like<00:03:22.750> um<00:03:23.970> let<00:03:24.970> me

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 
probably see something like um let me

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:34.650 
probably see something like um let me
get<00:03:25.209> a<00:03:25.269> pen<00:03:25.870> and<00:03:25.900> a<00:03:26.079> pencil<00:03:26.320> or<00:03:26.829> something<00:03:33.660> okay

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:34.660 
get a pen and a pencil or something okay

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:43.819 
get a pen and a pencil or something okay
so<00:03:34.720> you<00:03:35.019> might<00:03:35.380> see<00:03:35.590> something<00:03:35.859> like<00:03:36.209> this<00:03:37.209> me

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:43.829 

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:50.400 

then<00:03:44.829> you'll<00:03:45.100> see<00:03:45.340> lo<00:03:48.989> you<00:03:49.989> see<00:03:50.140> something

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:50.410 
then you'll see lo you see something
