00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.250
Unfortunately Sir, We have grave news for you.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.500
Today, After watching the Apple Live 2015 event,

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:07.500
a lot of Apple fans left the event very angry.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
And the violence from all the anger is spreading rapidly.

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:15.500
Fans have headed straight to Windows Store,
here and here.

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.000
Fine, fine. What are they mad about?

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.500
And what did Apple launch at the event?

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.500
My fuhrer...

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:28.500
Well...

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.500
New MacBook (non-touch) for $1299.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
And it has ONLY one USB-C port.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.500
Everybody who bought the
Lenovo Yoga Pro 3, Dell XPS 13, Asus ZenBook UX305,
please leave the room, now.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
What the f**k? How can they put just one USB-C port?

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:17.750
What if I need to connect my thumb drive while charging?

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.250
My USB Mouse, my USB Keyboard
and my HDMI cable...

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.000
They told thunderbolt was the NEXT big thing...

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.000
Now it is a NO big deal.

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.000
Should we conclude thunderbolt is truly DEAD now?

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:37.750
What were they thinking????
NOT a single standard USB port.

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:40.500
And how the f**k will I connect ALL devices using ONLY one USB-C port?

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.750
My fuhrer..
Apple has made a USB-C Digital AV Multiport Adapter.

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.250
Oh Great!
They expect us to carry a USB-C Adapter wherever we go...

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.800
My fuhrer, the new Macbook now comes in GOLD.

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:52.000
Jony and his GOLD color.
F**k the f**king GOLD!!!

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.500
Who the f**k do you think I am?

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.750
A 480p web camera and a single USB-C port.

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.500
And they expect me to pay $1299 for it?

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.500
And what if I forget to carry the USB-C Adapter?

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.000
Do they expect me to buy a new USB-C Adapter EVERY f**king time?

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:13.500
And if the USB-C port is so small,
why could not they just 2 more???

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.750
Why don't these people understand,
we require additional ports.

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.750
Steve Jobs would have fired them all, 
the minute he would have seen the "new" MacBook.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
How am I supposed to video chat on a 
480p web camera?

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.000
Really? A 480p webcam.
Even my iPod has 720p front camera.

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.500
I looked Awesome!

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.500
What about the new iPhones?

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.500
Are they going ship them with
both USB-C and USB 2.0 cables?

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:53.000
And will the new iPhone 6S / 6S Plus
come with USB-C connector?

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
Who is going to answer? Tim or Jony?

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.750
Or will I have to wait till September, 2015.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.500
Steve Jobs must have been rolling in his grave.

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:07.500
The NEXT "new" MacBook will have 3 USB-C ports.

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.250
I hope the USB-C Adapter is included.

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:23.250
It would be a crime paying extra for it.

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:26.750
Specially if it is $79.00.

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.750
Declare WAR if it is NOT included.

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:46.250
Go ahead, Pre-Order
the new MacBook and the Apple Watch.

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:49.000
Order in GOLD color.

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:56.000
Also, Buy an EXTRA USB-C Adapter.
