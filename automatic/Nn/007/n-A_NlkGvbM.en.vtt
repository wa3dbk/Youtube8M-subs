00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.970 
in and all the heat and all the air goes
out<00:02:35.220> of<00:02:35.700> the<00:02:35.940> case<00:02:36.180> with<00:02:36.870> these<00:02:37.049> push-pull

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
out of the case with these push-pull

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.880 
out of the case with these push-pull
configuration<00:02:39.170> fans<00:02:40.170> and<00:02:40.560> there's<00:02:40.799> a

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
configuration fans and there's a

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:42.440 
configuration fans and there's a
radiator<00:02:41.430> in<00:02:41.459> the<00:02:41.579> back<00:02:41.760> you<00:02:41.940> can't<00:02:42.180> see<00:02:42.360> it

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
radiator in the back you can't see it

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:46.160 
radiator in the back you can't see it
but<00:02:42.599> I'll<00:02:42.720> show<00:02:42.959> you<00:02:43.280> the<00:02:44.280> heat<00:02:44.489> goes<00:02:44.670> out<00:02:45.170> so

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
but I'll show you the heat goes out so

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.470 
but I'll show you the heat goes out so
let<00:02:47.069> me<00:02:47.160> open<00:02:47.250> the<00:02:47.430> case<00:02:47.610> up<00:02:47.879> like<00:02:48.090> I<00:02:48.120> said<00:02:48.329> it's

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
let me open the case up like I said it's

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:53.930 
let me open the case up like I said it's
a<00:02:48.540> heavily<00:02:48.780> modded<00:02:49.290> case<00:02:52.400> here<00:02:53.400> we<00:02:53.519> go<00:02:53.640> there's

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
a heavily modded case here we go there's

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:59.710 
a heavily modded case here we go there's
quad<00:02:54.239> 79<00:02:54.780> 70s<00:02:55.790> water<00:02:56.790> cooling<00:02:57.239> in<00:02:57.359> parallel<00:02:57.900> so

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720 
quad 79 70s water cooling in parallel so

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.270 
quad 79 70s water cooling in parallel so
you<00:03:00.720> know<00:03:00.810> they<00:03:01.079> all<00:03:01.170> once<00:03:01.890> the<00:03:01.980> water<00:03:02.160> gets

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
you know they all once the water gets

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.670 
you know they all once the water gets
through<00:03:02.489> here<00:03:02.849> it's<00:03:03.090> basically<00:03:04.010> in<00:03:05.010> and<00:03:05.310> out

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:06.680 
through here it's basically in and out

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:11.650 
through here it's basically in and out
so<00:03:07.680> it<00:03:08.069> keeps<00:03:08.310> all<00:03:08.640> the<00:03:08.970> cards<00:03:09.660> evenly<00:03:10.109> cold<00:03:10.500> I

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:11.660 
so it keeps all the cards evenly cold I

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:14.059 
so it keeps all the cards evenly cold I
like<00:03:12.660> that<00:03:12.930> there's<00:03:13.200> another<00:03:13.410> fan<00:03:13.799> there

00:03:14.059 --> 00:03:14.069 
like that there's another fan there

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:21.309 
like that there's another fan there

clicking had any problems with it and

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:41.479 
clicking had any problems with it and
I've<00:03:39.030> the<00:03:39.389> computers<00:03:39.750> actually<00:03:39.930> uh<00:03:40.340> like<00:03:41.340> The

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:23.760 
one and there's still enough clearance

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:26.820 
one and there's still enough clearance

there and even with these - well these
four<00:05:31.810> fans<00:05:32.139> are<00:05:32.410> still<00:05:32.770> enough<00:05:33.039> space<00:05:33.310> you

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:33.340 
four fans are still enough space you

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:36.710 
four fans are still enough space you
know<00:05:33.580> nothing's<00:05:33.970> touching<00:05:34.440> basically<00:05:35.440> every

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:36.720 
know nothing's touching basically every

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:40.469 
know nothing's touching basically every
every<00:05:37.720> inch<00:05:37.960> of<00:05:38.139> this<00:05:38.289> case<00:05:38.680> is<00:05:39.150> put<00:05:40.150> to<00:05:40.270> some

00:05:40.469 --> 00:05:40.479 
every inch of this case is put to some

00:05:40.479 --> 00:05:43.260 
every inch of this case is put to some
use<00:05:41.400> it's<00:05:42.400> not<00:05:42.490> like<00:05:42.700> anything's<00:05:43.090> going<00:05:43.210> to

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:43.270 
use it's not like anything's going to

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:44.700 
use it's not like anything's going to
get<00:05:43.450> in<00:05:43.510> the<00:05:43.599> way<00:05:43.720> it's<00:05:43.960> a<00:05:44.050> really<00:05:44.260> good<00:05:44.440> case

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:44.710 
get in the way it's a really good case

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:48.210 
get in the way it's a really good case
and<00:05:44.979> it's<00:05:45.099> still<00:05:45.400> a<00:05:45.430> mid<00:05:45.789> Tower<00:05:46.030> so<00:05:47.220> surprising

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:48.220 
and it's still a mid Tower so surprising

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:49.710 
and it's still a mid Tower so surprising
you<00:05:48.310> don't<00:05:48.460> have<00:05:48.550> to<00:05:48.639> go<00:05:48.760> to<00:05:48.820> a<00:05:48.940> full<00:05:49.240> Tower<00:05:49.479> to

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:49.720 
you don't have to go to a full Tower to

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:52.800 
you don't have to go to a full Tower to
get<00:05:49.870> all<00:05:49.990> this<00:05:50.139> stuff<00:05:50.289> in<00:05:50.560> here<00:05:51.599> except<00:05:52.599> for

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:52.810 
get all this stuff in here except for

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:56.370 
get all this stuff in here except for
the<00:05:53.910> Raiders<00:05:54.910> on<00:05:55.060> that<00:05:55.240> this<00:05:55.450> Raiders<00:05:55.690> on<00:05:56.200> the

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:56.380 
the Raiders on that this Raiders on the

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:58.950 
the Raiders on that this Raiders on the
outside<00:05:56.770> but<00:05:56.889> I<00:05:56.950> like<00:05:57.190> that<00:05:57.430> a<00:05:58.300> lot<00:05:58.690> of<00:05:58.720> heat

00:05:58.950 --> 00:05:58.960 
outside but I like that a lot of heat

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:02.670 
outside but I like that a lot of heat
goes<00:05:59.139> through<00:05:59.349> here<00:06:01.320> sometimes<00:06:02.320> that's<00:06:02.440> a<00:06:02.500> go

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:02.680 
goes through here sometimes that's a go

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:04.980 
goes through here sometimes that's a go
over<00:06:02.860> and<00:06:03.010> plug<00:06:03.190> something<00:06:03.460> in<00:06:03.729> and<00:06:03.970> it<00:06:04.000> really

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:04.990 
over and plug something in and it really

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:07.260 
over and plug something in and it really
heats<00:06:05.260> up<00:06:05.500> so<00:06:06.099> I<00:06:06.370> mean<00:06:06.550> that's<00:06:06.669> good<00:06:06.970> that<00:06:07.150> the

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:07.270 
heats up so I mean that's good that the

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:09.600 
heats up so I mean that's good that the
heats<00:06:07.479> not<00:06:07.570> in<00:06:07.840> the<00:06:07.900> video<00:06:08.169> cards<00:06:08.530> and<00:06:08.770> it's

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:09.610 
heats not in the video cards and it's

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:11.879 
heats not in the video cards and it's
out<00:06:09.760> of<00:06:09.820> the<00:06:09.940> case<00:06:10.150> so<00:06:10.450> it<00:06:11.289> uses<00:06:11.560> less<00:06:11.830> power

00:06:11.879 --> 00:06:11.889 
out of the case so it uses less power

00:06:11.889 --> 00:06:16.020 
out of the case so it uses less power
that<00:06:12.400> way<00:06:13.650> so<00:06:14.650> that's<00:06:14.830> about<00:06:14.979> it<00:06:15.130> I<00:06:15.490> like<00:06:15.940> I

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:16.030 
that way so that's about it I like I

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:18.270 
that way so that's about it I like I
said<00:06:16.090> I<00:06:16.270> put<00:06:16.630> in<00:06:16.750> my<00:06:16.900> two<00:06:16.960> pre-orders<00:06:17.770> for<00:06:18.010> my

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:18.280 
said I put in my two pre-orders for my

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:20.339

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:25.300 
those in it's going to be a lower energy
