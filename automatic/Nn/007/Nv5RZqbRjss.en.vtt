 we will let it warm up 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:24.190
 we will add our cod steaks at this point as you can see 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:27.270

 they were put in the pan 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.000
 now we just have to wait 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.140
 fifteen minutes and they will be ready 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.440
 I wanted to suggest something in the eventuality 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:55.640
 not everything was consumed 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.560

 the sauce can be seasoned with the pasta di Ã¨ sicuro 

00:02:15.799 --> 00:02:17.979
 that really very tasty 

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:20.779
 I moved to a smaller fire 

00:02:20.779 --> 00:02:23.839
 the pan to do so 

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:26.399
 continue cooking the world 

00:02:26.399 --> 00:02:28.539
 so slow 

00:02:28.539 --> 00:02:30.219
 but uniform 

00:02:30.219 --> 00:02:33.219
 I assure you that it is the perfume of meteo.it 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:36.259
 my mouth is already watering 

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:39.259
 I just shot our cod steaks 

00:02:39.779 --> 00:02:42.479
 so that they cook 

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:46.639
 you have to be a part of it, but you may not like it at all 

00:02:46.639 --> 00:02:47.619
 anyway 

00:02:47.619 --> 00:02:49.389
 when it's about to complete 

00:02:49.389 --> 00:02:52.870
 I add a pepper to the cooking 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:55.569
 minimum ppc 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:57.929
 they really do get respected 

00:02:57.929 --> 00:03:00.929
 to cooking so that 

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:05.299

00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:12.169
