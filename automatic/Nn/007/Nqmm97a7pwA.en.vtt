 if you want a beautiful lawn 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:06.740
 grid there are some elementary rules 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:06.740
 to respect 

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:14.200
 a mower is dangerous to avoid 

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:15.760
 any risk of projection or damage 

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:18.160
 caused to the lady at the kart'are of the 

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:20.650
 mower browse your lawn in all 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:23.170
 meaning before starting to mow 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:24.970
 pick up all the toys the pebbles 

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:27.579
 dead branches or any other object 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:29.829
 who litter your soil if you own 

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:31.630
 a self-propelled push mower or not 

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:33.250
 start by cutting around 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:34.870
 obstacles the tree trunks the 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:36.760
 massive suburbs the aisles the 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:39.070
 fence feet and if you do not pick up 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:41.469
 not the cuts eject the herbs to 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:42.160
 inside the lawn and never on 

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:43.780
 the mountains 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:45.699
 if you have an ejector 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:47.710
 lateral on the left begins and 

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:49.329
 always in the opposite direction of a 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:51.730
 world needle simply for 

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:52.960
 avoid splashing grass on your 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:55.570
 alleyways or in your massive 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.850
 if your mower has a basket so 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:59.710
 you pick up your grass especially done 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:01.719
 back and forth when you tend 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:03.519
 your turf and the next time when 

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:04.839
 you will fall to mow them in 

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:07.510
 the other way so not always 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:09.010
 stomp your lawn at the same place if 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:10.420
 you do not have baskets at your disposal 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:11.350
 round of you can also pick up 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.420
 the grass so for that you go 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:15.160
 use a lawn mower or a rake 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:17.380
 and put that in a wheelbarrow and you have 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:19.720
 use these terms to practice 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:21.400
 the mÃ¶nch to cover the ground at the foot of 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.840
 shrubs or why not at the foot of 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.430
 bamboo that will allow to feed them 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.050
 and in addition it will avoid the bad ones 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:27.400
 grasses to grow at this place 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:29.680
 if you have a lot of going in your 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:31.750
 garden especially adapt your aisles by 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:33.940
 compared to the mower one to two passages 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:35.710
 maximum by was always going to win 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:37.120
 time avoid steps before 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:38.500
 back steps arrange for that 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:39.910
 the massifs are from ubs the most 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.890
 unitary possible 

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:43.300
 and then at the edge of the massifs 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:45.250
 not to make cuts you go 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:46.630
 earn a serious so many tents 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:47.980
 you know that when you fall 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:48.430
 you do not do anything else in your 

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:50.410
 garden 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:52.090
 concerning the height of the cut 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:53.380
 did not expect too much in the spring before 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:54.580
 to mow because you are going to be at 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.110
 clothing mistakes initially the 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:58.210
 height so if you're overwhelmed by 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.470
 height do not cut more than a third 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:01.480
 every time better to mow 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:03.400
 several times to get to the height 

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:06.790
 wanted during the summer if it's dry 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:07.990
 do not miss your lawn because 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:10.629
 following you may have a 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:13.450
 mosquito invasion one goes back a 

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:16.630
 notch even two notches your blade of 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:18.400
 grass and especially do not hesitate to 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:19.810
 leave the air on top so 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.550
 that it makes a little blanket 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:23.470
 always in competence 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:25.420
 to prevent your humble ones from drying up 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:27.070
 you can also opt for the must the 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:28.720
 principle of evil these two plates and the 

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:29.080
 grass on the ground does not need to 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.940
 to pick up 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.800
 only disadvantage it is not necessary 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:34.330
 wait until the grass is too much for the 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:36.430
 to do it must fall much more 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:38.740
 often and your lawn is still 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:40.660
 friendlier respect your neighbors 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:41.920
 because the sound of the mower can 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:43.690
 disturb then there are 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.500
 regulations in the villages or 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:47.020
 in your city 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.490
 be respectful but especially a 

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:50.440
 little bit of common sense like that you 

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:54.600
 enjoy your aperitif with 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.600
 your neighbor on a green lawn
