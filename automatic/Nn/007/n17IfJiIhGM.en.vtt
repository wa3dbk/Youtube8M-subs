00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
part two the motorized bike build on I

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.829 
part two the motorized bike build on I
got<00:00:14.490> the<00:00:14.610> engine<00:00:14.880> running<00:00:14.910> and<00:00:15.360> I'll<00:00:15.509> show<00:00:15.750> you

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
starts up at one pole but um it it runs

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.250 
starts up at one pole but um it it runs
good<00:00:24.029> it<00:00:24.150> starts<00:00:24.390> up<00:00:24.449> in<00:00:24.539> a<00:00:24.600> couple<00:00:24.720> poles<00:00:25.019> in<00:00:25.230> a

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
good it starts up in a couple poles in a

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:26.839 
good it starts up in a couple poles in a
cold<00:00:25.680> start<00:00:25.980> so<00:00:26.160> that's<00:00:26.369> good

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
cold start so that's good

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.240 
cold start so that's good

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:21.080 
gonna let the green BMX because uh um

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:27.530 
gonna let the green BMX because uh um
this<00:01:22.130> bike<00:01:23.130> it's<00:01:23.490> got<00:01:23.820> the<00:01:24.210> UM<00:01:24.420> uh<00:01:26.240> this<00:01:27.240> bike

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
this bike it's got the UM uh this bike

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.340 
this bike it's got the UM uh this bike
as<00:01:27.750> you<00:01:27.840> can<00:01:28.020> see<00:01:28.380> on<00:01:29.100> it's<00:01:30.030> a<00:01:30.210> lot<00:01:30.360> more<00:01:30.570> intact

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
as you can see on it's a lot more intact

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.550 
as you can see on it's a lot more intact
like<00:01:31.680> and<00:01:31.920> it<00:01:32.159> is<00:01:32.280> like<00:01:33.079> this<00:01:34.079> thing<00:01:34.259> is<00:01:34.350> just

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
like and it is like this thing is just

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.190 
like and it is like this thing is just
going<00:01:34.650> to<00:01:34.740> look<00:01:34.829> better<00:01:35.100> because<00:01:35.960> just<00:01:36.960> part

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
going to look better because just part

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.510 
going to look better because just part
of<00:01:37.229> my<00:01:37.320> mount<00:01:37.590> when<00:01:37.770> working<00:01:38.070> on<00:01:38.189> using

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
of my mount when working on using

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.660 
of my mount when working on using
Goliath<00:01:39.750> stirs<00:01:40.110> yeah

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
Goliath stirs yeah

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.139 
Goliath stirs yeah
now<00:01:42.509> this<00:01:42.720> bike<00:01:43.189> is<00:01:44.189> just<00:01:44.670> going<00:01:44.850> to<00:01:44.939> be<00:01:45.000> better

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
now this bike is just going to be better

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.830 
now this bike is just going to be better
because<00:01:45.409> this<00:01:46.409> tire<00:01:46.860> will<00:01:47.490> work<00:01:48.240> better<00:01:48.540> for

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
because this tire will work better for

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.050 
because this tire will work better for
the<00:01:48.930> friction<00:01:49.350> drive<00:01:49.560> because<00:01:50.009> this<00:01:50.250> is<00:01:50.490> G's

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
the friction drive because this is G's

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.789 
the friction drive because this is G's
will<00:01:51.329> this<00:01:52.079> is<00:01:52.170> probably<00:01:52.380> actually<00:01:52.649> get<00:01:52.770> a

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
will this is probably actually get a

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.200 
will this is probably actually get a
better<00:01:52.950> grip<00:01:53.220> but<00:01:53.399> they'll<00:01:53.579> just<00:01:53.729> get<00:01:53.880> chewed

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
better grip but they'll just get chewed

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.700 
better grip but they'll just get chewed
up<00:01:54.360> fast<00:01:54.720> because<00:01:55.170> it's<00:01:55.290> kind<00:01:55.470> of<00:01:55.530> like<00:01:55.680> a

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
up fast because it's kind of like a

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.330 
up fast because it's kind of like a
cheap<00:01:56.250> rubber<00:01:56.689> those<00:01:57.689> are<00:01:57.810> like<00:01:57.960> Chinese<00:01:58.530> like

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
cheap rubber those are like Chinese like

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.760 
cheap rubber those are like Chinese like
rubber<00:01:59.759> wheels<00:02:00.090> that<00:02:00.450> I<00:02:00.689> had<00:02:01.380> laying<00:02:01.649> around

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
rubber wheels that I had laying around

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.469 
rubber wheels that I had laying around
put<00:02:02.280> I<00:02:02.310> had<00:02:02.490> to<00:02:02.549> put<00:02:02.700> them<00:02:02.820> on<00:02:02.850> there<00:02:03.090> a<00:02:03.299> long

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
put I had to put them on there a long

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.990 
put I had to put them on there a long

about moving this tire exid this wheel

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.510 
about moving this tire exid this wheel
but<00:02:22.140> I<00:02:22.170> think<00:02:22.560> this<00:02:22.680> one<00:02:22.890> will<00:02:23.040> get<00:02:23.190> a<00:02:23.250> fine

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
but I think this one will get a fine

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:24.020 
but I think this one will get a fine
grip

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030
