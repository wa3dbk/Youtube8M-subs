review of just chassis come guy go over

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.230 
review of just chassis come guy go over
the<00:00:19.590> basic<00:00:19.890> things<00:00:20.130> and<00:00:20.340> that<00:00:20.460> show<00:00:20.640> you<00:00:20.699> a

the basic things and that show you a
running<00:00:21.630> video<00:00:21.900> of<00:00:22.080> it<00:00:23.210> so<00:00:24.210> starting<00:00:24.660> with<00:00:24.689> the

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
running video of it so starting with the

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.759 
running video of it so starting with the
installation<00:00:25.380> the<00:00:26.369> installation<00:00:26.670> was<00:00:27.180> very

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:27.769 
installation the installation was very

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:32.389 
installation the installation was very
difficult<00:00:28.769> for<00:00:29.220> me<00:00:29.640> at<00:00:29.880> least<00:00:30.410> from<00:00:31.410> what<00:00:32.250> I've

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
difficult for me at least from what I've

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.690 
difficult for me at least from what I've
heard<00:00:32.430> other<00:00:32.820> people<00:00:32.910> had<00:00:33.390> better<00:00:33.630> luck<00:00:34.309> but<00:00:35.309> a

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
heard other people had better luck but a

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.260 
heard other people had better luck but a
lot<00:00:36.450> of<00:00:36.480> my<00:00:36.660> screws<00:00:37.110> weren't<00:00:37.680> fitting<00:00:38.160> and<00:00:38.850> the

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
lot of my screws weren't fitting and the

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.319 
lot of my screws weren't fitting and the
the<00:00:40.230> servo<00:00:40.770> had<00:00:41.190> trouble<00:00:41.640> getting<00:00:41.760> in<00:00:42.090> there

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
the servo had trouble getting in there

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.020 
the servo had trouble getting in there
and<00:00:43.110> he<00:00:43.500> had<00:00:43.680> to<00:00:43.829> make<00:00:43.950> dessert<00:00:44.340> the<00:00:44.789> servo

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
and he had to make dessert the servo

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.500 
and he had to make dessert the servo
thing<00:00:45.360> at<00:00:45.600> 45<00:00:46.110> degree<00:00:46.440> angle<00:00:46.920> and<00:00:47.280> it's<00:00:47.640> really

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
thing at 45 degree angle and it's really

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.529 
thing at 45 degree angle and it's really
just<00:00:48.780> different<00:00:49.530> now<00:00:50.489> I<00:00:50.789> did<00:00:51.030> get<00:00:51.180> everything

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
just different now I did get everything

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.799 
just different now I did get everything
working<00:00:52.160> it<00:00:53.160> does<00:00:53.460> there<00:00:54.030> are<00:00:54.210> a<00:00:54.270> few<00:00:54.570> things

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
working it does there are a few things

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.810 
working it does there are a few things
different<00:00:55.530> that<00:00:55.829> probably<00:00:56.280> shouldn't<00:00:56.610> be

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
different that probably shouldn't be

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.010 
different that probably shouldn't be
that<00:00:57.090> way<00:00:57.149> but<00:00:57.360> it<00:00:57.660> is<00:00:57.809> working<00:00:58.350> so

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:00.020 
that way but it is working so

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:01.730 
that way but it is working so
installation

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:01.740

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:05.150 
installation
out<00:01:02.670> of<00:01:02.880> 10<00:01:03.150> for<00:01:03.180> ease<00:01:03.720> I<00:01:04.050> give<00:01:04.290> it<00:01:04.380> like<00:01:04.410> a<00:01:04.590> five

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:05.160 
out of 10 for ease I give it like a five

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:08.300 
out of 10 for ease I give it like a five
it<00:01:05.670> really<00:01:05.910> was<00:01:06.180> not<00:01:06.390> easy<00:01:06.660> I<00:01:06.990> mean<00:01:07.560> I've<00:01:07.770> done

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
it really was not easy I mean I've done

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.720 
it really was not easy I mean I've done
a<00:01:08.610> few<00:01:09.210> chasity's<00:01:09.840> for<00:01:10.460> electric<00:01:11.460> buggy

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:11.730 
a few chasity's for electric buggy

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:13.940 
a few chasity's for electric buggy
before<00:01:12.570> which<00:01:12.660> I've<00:01:12.780> short<00:01:12.990> course<00:01:13.230> twice<00:01:13.530> for

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
before which I've short course twice for

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.110 
before which I've short course twice for
my<00:01:14.070> sexual<00:01:14.430> wife<00:01:14.580> or<00:01:14.760> a<00:01:14.940> mi<00:01:15.450> se<00:01:15.630> te<00:01:16.790> and<00:01:17.790> this

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:18.120 
my sexual wife or a mi se te and this

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:19.520 
my sexual wife or a mi se te and this
was<00:01:18.300> really<00:01:18.510> hard<00:01:18.840> and<00:01:18.990> it's<00:01:19.140> a<00:01:19.230> two<00:01:19.380> wheel

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
was really hard and it's a two wheel

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:20.930 
was really hard and it's a two wheel
drive<00:01:19.560> so<00:01:19.950> I<00:01:19.980> think<00:01:20.100> that<00:01:20.310> they<00:01:20.520> could<00:01:20.580> have

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:20.940 
drive so I think that they could have

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:23.000 
drive so I think that they could have
kept<00:01:21.330> it<00:01:21.450> a<00:01:21.540> little<00:01:21.630> more<00:01:21.840> traditional<00:01:22.050> but

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:23.010 
kept it a little more traditional but

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:25.130 
kept it a little more traditional but
they<00:01:23.130> didn't<00:01:23.490> and<00:01:23.880> you<00:01:24.330> know<00:01:24.420> it's<00:01:24.690> fine<00:01:24.840> if<00:01:25.020> it

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
they didn't and you know it's fine if it

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.330 
they didn't and you know it's fine if it
works<00:01:26.330> Electronics<00:01:27.330> is<00:01:27.900> pretty<00:01:28.710> up<00:01:28.860> pretty

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
works Electronics is pretty up pretty

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:30.650

and screw back in and it is very snug in
there<00:01:50.780> the<00:01:50.899> battery<00:01:51.140> does<00:01:51.380> not<00:01:51.560> go<00:01:51.710> anywhere

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:51.890 
there the battery does not go anywhere

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:54.069 
there the battery does not go anywhere
for<00:01:52.189> a<00:01:52.250> standard<00:01:52.549> to<00:01:52.939> sell<00:01:53.210> comes<00:01:53.780> with<00:01:53.929> these

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:09.070 
can um make them a little bit bigger but
it<00:02:07.459> is<00:02:07.640> kind<00:02:07.880> of<00:02:07.909> hard<00:02:07.969> to<00:02:08.179> get<00:02:08.479> off<00:02:08.690> and<00:02:08.899> on

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.080 
it is kind of hard to get off and on

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:13.720 
it is kind of hard to get off and on
stuff<00:02:09.560> like<00:02:09.590> that<00:02:10.900> so<00:02:11.900> on<00:02:12.410> to<00:02:13.069> performance

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
stuff like that so on to performance

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:15.369 
stuff like that so on to performance
like<00:02:14.420> i<00:02:14.540> said<00:02:14.629> i'll<00:02:14.810> show<00:02:14.930> you<00:02:14.989> the<00:02:15.140> running

00:02:15.369 --> 00:02:15.379 
like i said i'll show you the running

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:17.199 
like i said i'll show you the running
video<00:02:15.620> later<00:02:16.040> and<00:02:16.340> i'm<00:02:16.790> trying<00:02:16.910> to<00:02:17.030> make<00:02:17.060> this

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:17.209 
video later and i'm trying to make this

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:21.190 
video later and i'm trying to make this
video<00:02:17.390> kind<00:02:17.750> of<00:02:17.870> fast<00:02:18.310> but<00:02:19.310> it<00:02:19.790> drives<00:02:20.329> so<00:02:20.840> much

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
video kind of fast but it drives so much

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.280 
video kind of fast but it drives so much
better<00:02:21.590> it<00:02:21.829> is<00:02:21.860> insane<00:02:22.489> the<00:02:22.849> car<00:02:23.390> doesn't<00:02:23.900> it

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
better it is insane the car doesn't it

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:26.770 
better it is insane the car doesn't it
like<00:02:24.709> can't<00:02:25.190> roll<00:02:25.489> over<00:02:25.819> due<00:02:26.090> to<00:02:26.299> physics

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
like can't roll over due to physics

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.890 
like can't roll over due to physics
because<00:02:27.190> the<00:02:28.190> chassis<00:02:28.670> is<00:02:28.700> below<00:02:29.450> the<00:02:29.480> center

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
because the chassis is below the center

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.759 
because the chassis is below the center
of<00:02:29.930> the<00:02:30.110> wheels<00:02:30.430> so<00:02:31.430> when<00:02:31.790> it's<00:02:31.940> running<00:02:32.150> it<00:02:33.109> it

00:02:33.759 --> 00:02:33.769 
of the wheels so when it's running it it

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:36.610 
of the wheels so when it's running it it
just<00:02:33.849> just<00:02:34.849> turns<00:02:35.209> it<00:02:35.480> doesn't<00:02:35.720> really<00:02:35.930> flip

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
just just turns it doesn't really flip

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.930 
just just turns it doesn't really flip
over<00:02:36.920> it<00:02:37.190> it<00:02:37.790> never<00:02:38.060> flipped<00:02:38.390> over<00:02:38.569> and<00:02:39.940> that

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
over it it never flipped over and that

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:42.819 
over it it never flipped over and that
is<00:02:41.120> really<00:02:41.629> great<00:02:41.810> because<00:02:41.989> the<00:02:42.319> standard<00:02:42.739> /

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:42.829 
is really great because the standard /

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:44.800 
is really great because the standard /
just<00:02:43.489> flips<00:02:43.760> over<00:02:43.940> and<00:02:44.150> over<00:02:44.269> and<00:02:44.480> over<00:02:44.599> and

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
just flips over and over and over and

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:49.870 
just flips over and over and over and
over<00:02:45.019> so<00:02:46.959> running<00:02:47.959> is<00:02:48.459> perfecto<00:02:49.459> it's<00:02:49.760> a

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:49.880 
over so running is perfecto it's a

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:52.720 
over so running is perfecto it's a
closer<00:02:50.480> to<00:02:50.750> an<00:02:50.870> sc10<00:02:51.410> than<00:02:51.680> a<00:02:51.769> blitz<00:02:52.010> if<00:02:52.280> you've

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
closer to an sc10 than a blitz if you've

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:55.270 
closer to an sc10 than a blitz if you've
driven<00:02:53.019> either<00:02:54.019> you'll<00:02:54.620> know<00:02:54.799> what<00:02:54.950> i<00:02:54.980> mean

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
driven either you'll know what i mean

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.670 
driven either you'll know what i mean
it's<00:02:55.670> more<00:02:55.970> like<00:02:56.150> at<00:02:56.299> sc10<00:02:56.930> i<00:02:56.989> think<00:02:57.410> which<00:02:57.650> is

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
it's more like at sc10 i think which is

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:58.780 
it's more like at sc10 i think which is
good<00:02:58.010> because<00:02:58.190> that<00:02:58.340> one's<00:02:58.639> all

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:58.790 
good because that one's all

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:02.020 
good because that one's all
championships<00:02:59.829> keeps<00:03:00.829> all<00:03:01.340> the<00:03:01.730> weight<00:03:01.849> low

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.030 
championships keeps all the weight low

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:04.089 
championships keeps all the weight low
to<00:03:02.090> the<00:03:02.239> ground<00:03:02.380> one<00:03:03.380> of<00:03:03.500> the<00:03:03.560> lowest<00:03:03.769> chassis

00:03:04.089 --> 00:03:04.099 
to the ground one of the lowest chassis

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:05.860 
to the ground one of the lowest chassis
as<00:03:04.310> you<00:03:04.430> can<00:03:04.519> get<00:03:04.700> I<00:03:04.910> think<00:03:05.510> it's<00:03:05.630> better<00:03:05.810> than

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:05.870 
as you can get I think it's better than

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:09.000 
as you can get I think it's better than
sliced<00:03:06.410> because<00:03:06.829> the<00:03:06.980> slice<00:03:07.190> puts<00:03:07.489> the

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010 
sliced because the slice puts the

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:12.010 
sliced because the slice puts the
correct<00:03:10.010> me<00:03:10.130> if<00:03:10.190> I'm<00:03:10.310> wrong<00:03:10.340> it<00:03:10.669> is<00:03:10.819> the<00:03:11.000> slide

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:12.020 
correct me if I'm wrong it is the slide

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:14.230 
correct me if I'm wrong it is the slide
they<00:03:12.620> put<00:03:13.160> the<00:03:13.250> motor<00:03:13.460> in<00:03:13.610> the<00:03:13.790> middle<00:03:14.150> and

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:14.240 
they put the motor in the middle and

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:15.580 
they put the motor in the middle and
that<00:03:14.420> doesn't<00:03:14.750> give<00:03:14.840> me<00:03:14.930> as<00:03:15.020> much<00:03:15.170> traction

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:15.590 
that doesn't give me as much traction

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:17.680 
that doesn't give me as much traction
because<00:03:16.040> in<00:03:16.250> a<00:03:16.340> 20<00:03:16.550> job<00:03:16.850> you<00:03:17.000> want<00:03:17.150> traction<00:03:17.450> in

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:17.690 
because in a 20 job you want traction in

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:19.030 
because in a 20 job you want traction in
the<00:03:17.720> rear<00:03:18.020> because<00:03:18.380> that's<00:03:18.560> where<00:03:18.740> the<00:03:18.830> motor

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040 
the rear because that's where the motor

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.820 
the rear because that's where the motor
is<00:03:19.310> I<00:03:19.550> mean<00:03:20.030> that's<00:03:20.150> where<00:03:20.390> the<00:03:20.510> power<00:03:21.350> goes

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:21.830 
is I mean that's where the power goes

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:25.060 
is I mean that's where the power goes
and<00:03:22.370> you<00:03:23.270> don't<00:03:23.450> need<00:03:23.840> much<00:03:24.140> up<00:03:24.380> front<00:03:24.620> just

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:25.070 
and you don't need much up front just

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:27.550 
and you don't need much up front just
steering<00:03:25.490> so<00:03:26.270> you<00:03:26.360> want<00:03:26.660> as<00:03:26.780> much<00:03:26.930> weight<00:03:27.320> in

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:27.560 
steering so you want as much weight in

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:30.010 
steering so you want as much weight in
the<00:03:27.800> rear<00:03:28.190> as<00:03:28.760> possible<00:03:29.270> without<00:03:29.420> making<00:03:29.930> it

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:30.020 
the rear as possible without making it

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:33.940 
the rear as possible without making it
too<00:03:30.140> heavy<00:03:30.500> and<00:03:32.020> I'm<00:03:33.020> glad<00:03:33.350> that<00:03:33.620> they<00:03:33.710> kept

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:33.950 
too heavy and I'm glad that they kept

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:36.640 
too heavy and I'm glad that they kept
him<00:03:34.040> under<00:03:34.130> back<00:03:34.370> here<00:03:34.550> this<00:03:34.730> chassis<00:03:35.260> so<00:03:36.260> with

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:36.650 
him under back here this chassis so with

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:38.440 
him under back here this chassis so with
that<00:03:36.800> I'll<00:03:37.070> show<00:03:37.310> you<00:03:37.400> guys<00:03:37.580> the<00:03:37.820> running

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:38.450 
that I'll show you guys the running

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:41.080 
that I'll show you guys the running
video<00:03:38.690> and<00:03:39.070> realize<00:03:40.070> that<00:03:40.100> this<00:03:40.430> is<00:03:40.490> my<00:03:40.850> first

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.090 
video and realize that this is my first

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:43.420 
video and realize that this is my first
to<00:03:41.240> drive<00:03:41.540> that<00:03:41.720> Iran<00:03:42.140> in<00:03:42.470> about<00:03:42.710> a<00:03:42.980> year<00:03:43.280> and<00:03:43.370> a

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:43.430 
to drive that Iran in about a year and a

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:47.110 
to drive that Iran in about a year and a
half<00:03:43.660> so<00:03:45.100> what's<00:03:46.100> it<00:03:46.220> the<00:03:46.310> best<00:03:46.460> driving<00:03:46.700> and

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120 
half so what's it the best driving and

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:50.050 
half so what's it the best driving and
it<00:03:47.270> was<00:03:47.360> also<00:03:47.630> with<00:03:47.840> a<00:03:47.900> slower<00:03:48.410> motor<00:03:48.710> I<00:03:49.030> have<00:03:50.030> a

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:50.060 
it was also with a slower motor I have a

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:53.890 
it was also with a slower motor I have a
different<00:03:50.210> one<00:03:50.480> here<00:03:50.780> now<00:03:51.250> so<00:03:52.750> nobody<00:03:53.750> guys

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:53.900 
different one here now so nobody guys

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:55.450 
different one here now so nobody guys
