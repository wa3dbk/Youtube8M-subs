00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.130 
day was a hundred and seventy thousand
level<00:01:04.739> and<00:01:04.949> he<00:01:05.909> had<00:01:06.090> thirteen<00:01:06.810> and<00:01:07.020> a<00:01:07.110> half

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.370 
level and he had thirteen and a half
million<00:01:07.710> health<00:01:08.189> at<00:01:08.430> that<00:01:08.610> level<00:01:08.930> so<00:01:09.930> it's

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
million health at that level so it's

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.950 
million health at that level so it's
quite<00:01:10.710> a<00:01:10.740> long<00:01:10.979> fight<00:01:11.369> because<00:01:12.240> I<00:01:12.479> couldn't

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.390 
have different step backs for every
weapon<00:02:21.180> musics<00:02:22.020> so<00:02:22.500> there's<00:02:22.920> six<00:02:23.250> different

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
weapon musics so there's six different

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:28.010 
weapon musics so there's six different
types<00:02:23.970> of<00:02:24.360> step<00:02:25.140> backs<00:02:25.410> and<00:02:26.150> you<00:02:27.150> can<00:02:27.450> use<00:02:27.720> a

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
types of step backs and you can use a

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.680 
types of step backs and you can use a
heel<00:02:28.530> ring<00:02:28.770> if<00:02:28.980> he<00:02:29.160> doesn't<00:02:29.640> have<00:02:29.790> immunity<00:02:30.270> to

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
heel ring if he doesn't have immunity to

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:33.260 
heel ring if he doesn't have immunity to
magic<00:02:31.260> because<00:02:32.040> he<00:02:32.160> doesn't<00:02:32.400> take<00:02:32.760> off<00:02:32.970> much

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
magic because he doesn't take off much

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:35.330 
magic because he doesn't take off much
health<00:02:33.600> if<00:02:33.840> you<00:02:33.870> if<00:02:34.140> you<00:02:34.410> do<00:02:34.590> get<00:02:34.770> hit<00:02:35.070> and

health if you if you do get hit and

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.240 
health if you if you do get hit and
that's<00:02:36.180> why<00:02:36.480> also<00:02:36.959> the<00:02:37.170> health<00:02:37.410> potion<00:02:37.980> is

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
that's why also the health potion is

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.270 
that's why also the health potion is
helpful<00:02:38.880> because<00:02:39.480> it<00:02:39.989> will<00:02:40.230> replenish<00:02:40.920> your

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:30.980 
then you get cat gems and that's helpful

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:34.209 
then you get cat gems and that's helpful
for<00:03:31.579> upgrading<00:03:32.480> your<00:03:32.840> dark<00:03:33.109> fire<00:03:33.439> or<00:03:33.799> rare

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:34.219 
for upgrading your dark fire or rare

00:03:34.219 --> 00:03:37.179 
for upgrading your dark fire or rare
stat<00:03:34.760> gems<00:03:35.150> so<00:03:36.019> it's<00:03:36.260> definitely<00:03:36.769> worth

00:03:37.179 --> 00:03:37.189 
stat gems so it's definitely worth

00:03:37.189 --> 00:03:39.819 
stat gems so it's definitely worth
taking<00:03:37.579> on<00:03:37.969> the<00:03:38.150> challenge<00:03:38.629> of<00:03:38.870> defeating<00:03:39.650> it

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:39.829 
taking on the challenge of defeating it

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:42.640 
taking on the challenge of defeating it
and<00:03:40.069> of<00:03:40.999> course<00:03:41.239> you<00:03:41.420> could<00:03:41.689> use<00:03:41.719> stun<00:03:42.349> lock

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:42.650 
and of course you could use stun lock

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:46.209 
and of course you could use stun lock
with<00:03:43.489> a<00:03:43.730> magic<00:03:44.209> immune<00:03:44.599> collector<00:03:45.319> but<00:03:45.920> I

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:46.219 
with a magic immune collector but I

00:03:46.219 --> 00:03:48.910 
with a magic immune collector but I
wanted<00:03:46.639> to<00:03:46.700> actually<00:03:47.239> fight<00:03:47.840> him<00:03:48.079> because<00:03:48.409> I

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:48.920 
wanted to actually fight him because I

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:52.479 
wanted to actually fight him because I
think<00:03:49.219> that's<00:03:49.400> more<00:03:49.639> fun<00:03:49.939> and<00:03:50.859> just<00:03:51.859> attacking

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:52.489 
think that's more fun and just attacking

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:55.149 
think that's more fun and just attacking
a<00:03:52.700> super<00:03:53.180> through<00:03:53.719> the<00:03:53.900> whole<00:03:54.079> fights<00:03:54.409> can<00:03:54.889> get

00:03:55.149 --> 00:03:55.159 
a super through the whole fights can get

00:03:55.159 --> 00:03:58.390 
a super through the whole fights can get
a<00:03:55.340> bit<00:03:55.549> monotonous<00:03:55.989> so<00:03:56.989> I<00:03:57.409> rather<00:03:57.769> try<00:03:58.280> and

00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:58.400 
a bit monotonous so I rather try and

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:00.699 
a bit monotonous so I rather try and
fighting<00:03:58.849> but<00:03:59.450> if<00:03:59.599> you<00:03:59.749> are<00:03:59.930> having<00:04:00.139> trouble

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:00.709 
fighting but if you are having trouble

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:02.979 
fighting but if you are having trouble
with<00:04:00.739> him<00:04:01.010> then<00:04:01.280> stun<00:04:01.639> lock<00:04:01.849> is<00:04:02.090> definitely<00:04:02.750> a

00:04:02.979 --> 00:04:02.989 
with him then stun lock is definitely a

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:07.300 
with him then stun lock is definitely a
good<00:04:03.439> idea<00:04:03.620> as<00:04:04.340> another<00:04:05.120> alternative<00:04:05.870> and<00:04:06.319> as

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:07.310 
good idea as another alternative and as

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:10.439 
good idea as another alternative and as
I<00:04:07.489> say<00:04:07.879> if<00:04:08.239> you<00:04:08.629> have<00:04:09.109> got<00:04:09.349> a<00:04:09.379> magic<00:04:09.799> immune

00:04:10.439 --> 00:04:10.449 
I say if you have got a magic immune

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:13.780 
I say if you have got a magic immune
collector<00:04:11.449> and<00:04:11.719> you<00:04:12.469> aren't<00:04:12.980> going<00:04:13.370> to<00:04:13.459> use

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:13.790 
collector and you aren't going to use

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:16.150 
collector and you aren't going to use
stun<00:04:14.299> lock<00:04:14.540> then<00:04:15.109> it<00:04:15.290> really<00:04:15.500> is<00:04:15.650> a<00:04:15.739> good<00:04:15.980> idea

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:16.160 
stun lock then it really is a good idea

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:18.249 
stun lock then it really is a good idea
to<00:04:16.759> get<00:04:16.880> familiar<00:04:17.329> with<00:04:17.449> these<00:04:17.660> step<00:04:18.019> backs

00:04:18.249 --> 00:04:18.259 
to get familiar with these step backs

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:21.400 
to get familiar with these step backs
and<00:04:18.620> I<00:04:19.400> way<00:04:19.609> to<00:04:19.669> refresh<00:04:20.120> myself<00:04:20.359> with<00:04:21.169> the

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:21.410 
and I way to refresh myself with the

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:24.339 
and I way to refresh myself with the
step-back<00:04:21.889> videos<00:04:22.400> before<00:04:23.150> I<00:04:23.539> take<00:04:23.990> on<00:04:24.169> the

00:04:24.339 --> 00:04:24.349 
step-back videos before I take on the

00:04:24.349 --> 00:04:26.890 
step-back videos before I take on the
fight<00:04:24.650> if<00:04:25.130> I<00:04:25.639> know<00:04:25.699> that<00:04:26.090> I'm<00:04:26.210> going<00:04:26.509> to<00:04:26.599> be

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:26.900 
fight if I know that I'm going to be

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:29.350 
fight if I know that I'm going to be
