the void it was a nice try at the

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:39.360 
the void it was a nice try at the
defense<00:04:38.199> I<00:04:38.319> think<00:04:38.560> this<00:04:38.680> should<00:04:38.860> be<00:04:39.039> at<00:04:39.340> least

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:39.370

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:41.700 
defense I think this should be at least
the<00:04:40.210> mailer<00:04:40.509> X<00:04:40.660> if<00:04:40.870> not<00:04:41.080> more<00:04:41.289> from<00:04:41.500> evil

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:41.710 
the mailer X if not more from evil

the mailer X if not more from evil
geniuses<00:04:42.039> and<00:04:42.970> samil<00:04:43.360> has<00:04:43.509> a<00:04:43.539> region<00:04:43.990> throwing

00:04:44.249 --> 00:04:44.259 
geniuses and samil has a region throwing

00:04:44.259 --> 00:04:46.950 
geniuses and samil has a region throwing
all<00:04:44.380> this<00:04:44.530> too<00:04:45.030> so<00:04:46.030> he's<00:04:46.330> just<00:04:46.509> in<00:04:46.569> the<00:04:46.630> papas

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:46.960 
all this too so he's just in the papas

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:48.420 
all this too so he's just in the papas
region<00:04:47.319> he'll<00:04:47.470> be<00:04:47.590> fine<00:04:47.800> they<00:04:47.949> get<00:04:48.069> the<00:04:48.190> racks

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:48.430 
region he'll be fine they get the racks

pretty<00:04:48.970> much<00:04:49.090> uncontested<00:04:49.919> they<00:04:50.919> lose<00:04:51.160> the

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:51.340 
pretty much uncontested they lose the

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:53.159 
pretty much uncontested they lose the
aegis<00:04:51.669> and<00:04:51.819> they<00:04:51.880> lose<00:04:52.030> universe<00:04:52.539> but<00:04:52.780> I<00:04:52.840> think

00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:53.169 
aegis and they lose universe but I think

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:54.420 
aegis and they lose universe but I think
they're<00:04:53.289> totally<00:04:53.590> fine<00:04:53.770> universe<00:04:54.099> gonna<00:04:54.310> go

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:54.430 
they're totally fine universe gonna go

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:56.909 
they're totally fine universe gonna go

me so it'll make his initiation that

00:04:59.199 --> 00:05:00.600 
me so it'll make his initiation that
much<00:04:59.409> easier<00:04:59.590> they<00:04:59.949> don't<00:05:00.130> need<00:05:00.220> to<00:05:00.340> be<00:05:00.370> cared
