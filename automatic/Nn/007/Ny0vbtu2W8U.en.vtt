which<00:01:12.280> we<00:01:12.490> brought<00:01:12.700> out<00:01:12.880> which<00:01:13.149> is<00:01:13.360> a<00:01:13.570> little

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:13.840 
which we brought out which is a little

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.870 
which we brought out which is a little
one<00:01:14.020> by<00:01:14.170> ten<00:01:14.380> cabinet<00:01:14.860> the<00:01:14.979> same<00:01:15.220> as<00:01:15.399> the<00:01:15.490> combo

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:15.880 
one by ten cabinet the same as the combo

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.450 
one by ten cabinet the same as the combo
but<00:01:16.750> also<00:01:17.170> similarly<00:01:17.649> of<00:01:17.860> course<00:01:17.920> people<00:01:18.310> are

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:18.460 
but also similarly of course people are

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:19.830 
but also similarly of course people are
going<00:01:18.580> to<00:01:18.670> be<00:01:18.759> sticking<00:01:19.119> these<00:01:19.210> into<00:01:19.479> four<00:01:19.509> by

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:19.840 
going to be sticking these into four by

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.440 
going to be sticking these into four by
twelve<00:01:20.140> two<00:01:20.500> by<00:01:20.649> twelves<00:01:21.159> and<00:01:21.369> obviously<00:01:22.270> you

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:22.450 
twelve two by twelves and obviously you

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:23.910 
twelve two by twelves and obviously you
experiment<00:01:22.930> with<00:01:23.020> the<00:01:23.170> cabinet's<00:01:23.619> you<00:01:23.770> get

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:23.920 
experiment with the cabinet's you get

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.190 
experiment with the cabinet's you get
different<00:01:24.130> sounds<00:01:24.399> anyway<00:01:24.909> have<00:01:25.270> another

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:26.200 
different sounds anyway have another

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:34.320 
different sounds anyway have another
sound<00:01:26.890> characters<00:01:32.250> 1960<00:01:33.250> ax<00:01:33.580> for<00:01:33.850> example<00:01:34.240> and

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:34.330 
sound characters 1960 ax for example and

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:35.370 
sound characters 1960 ax for example and
you'll<00:01:34.420> get<00:01:34.539> a<00:01:34.569> different<00:01:34.780> sound<00:01:35.110> from<00:01:35.289> the

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:35.380 
you'll get a different sound from the

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:37.620 
you'll get a different sound from the
standard<00:01:35.710> 1960<00:01:36.490> and<00:01:36.909> it<00:01:37.000> allows<00:01:37.210> you<00:01:37.360> to<00:01:37.390> play

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:37.630
