00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.469
 from the back are the enemies 

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:11.219
 are regenerating in that area right at 

00:00:08.469 --> 00:00:11.219
 point side 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.410
 enemy 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:43.280
 and from the studio said accurate and here 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:48.379
 with the caster at home as we have it 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:51.140
 with the good guys so caster 

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:53.809
 Well to comment what is 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:57.800
 basically tried of emotion and 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:59.540
 sing also of spark of something from 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.430
 grace maybe and to get there 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:03.620
 the truth that it was all very casual not 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:07.369
 all the personalities you already know that 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:08.869
 They exist in life because I started playing 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:11.810
 this game that I was playing with 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:13.430
 youtube in 2007 with the warfare four 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.229
 and good by its side had been erased 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:16.759
 but the other one is something that came up 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:21.039
 opportunity to start creating a channel 

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:21.039
 as a friend of a team and of 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:25.930
 opportunities 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:28.090
 up to this point and before call of duty 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:30.220
 that the game goes up, if you 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:33.130
 really that I would have played before 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:35.640
 had played halo to diop luque and 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:38.650
 little things like that a little bit more 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:42.810
 let's say I do not know if you remember the first one 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:47.200
 all the first one if I also played 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:49.750
 because I believe that the IUT or the super mccain 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:52.180
 nintendo if I remember correctly or nintendo 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:55.930
 64 the air goal and the first first 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:57.610
 game alex kidd in master system are not 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:00.460
 classified you knew that when writing you are going to 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:02.800
 being the sega mascot did not know how many 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:05.350
 people have right now because now 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:07.870
 same I have xbox one I have 16 14 and 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:09.760
 playstation is then when they have 

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:11.410
 to control judas or believe that with 

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:16.069
 only the games I started playing in 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:18.549
 playstation3 and by labor issues 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:21.560
 there is always within the scope of caster 

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:24.290
 it flashed so much on playstation 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:26.650
 3 as in xbox you think that seeing it as 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:29.680
 really 1 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:31.989
 ay with a belt who do not believe it because 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:35.709
 Well, I guess it's much more 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:39.000
 man who overwhelms the first ink 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:39.000

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:45.370
