00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
is Wagyu represented by this circle here

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.450 
is Wagyu represented by this circle here
so<00:00:39.030> this<00:00:39.300> is<00:00:39.480> all<00:00:39.750> the<00:00:40.020> beef<00:00:40.230> in<00:00:40.559> Japan<00:00:41.070> that<00:00:41.100> is

apologize for any errors tajima's one of
several<00:01:37.020> strains<00:01:38.009> of<00:01:38.310> a<00:01:38.369> particular<00:01:38.700> line

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
several strains of a particular line

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.140 
several strains of a particular line
that<00:01:40.200> end<00:01:40.740> up<00:01:40.920> with<00:01:41.100> a<00:01:41.130> heavy<00:01:41.460> marbling<00:01:41.970> that

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
that end up with a heavy marbling that

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.690 
that end up with a heavy marbling that
you<00:01:42.240> see<00:01:42.450> throughout<00:01:43.110> the<00:01:43.369> steaks<00:01:44.369> and

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
you see throughout the steaks and

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.310 
you see throughout the steaks and
something<00:01:45.270> about<00:01:45.360> the<00:01:45.570> heavy<00:01:45.750> marbling

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
something about the heavy marbling

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.350 
something about the heavy marbling
changes<00:01:46.860> the<00:01:47.040> ratio<00:01:47.520> of<00:01:47.579> omega-3<00:01:48.180> and<00:01:48.270> omega-6

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
changes the ratio of omega-3 and omega-6

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.660 
changes the ratio of omega-3 and omega-6
fatty<00:01:49.140> acids<00:01:49.619> and<00:01:49.770> so<00:01:50.040> there's<00:01:50.280> a<00:01:50.369> higher

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
fatty acids and so there's a higher

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.760 
fatty acids and so there's a higher
ratio<00:01:50.909> of<00:01:51.180> monounsaturated<00:01:51.600> fats<00:01:52.500> to

ratio of monounsaturated fats to
saturated<00:01:53.250> fats<00:01:53.549> monounsaturated<00:01:54.329> fats<00:01:55.110> are

saturated fats monounsaturated fats are

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.260 
saturated fats monounsaturated fats are

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
small and there's not a lot of space

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.229 
small and there's not a lot of space
here<00:03:43.889> now<00:03:44.069> we<00:03:44.130> probably<00:03:44.489> didn't<00:03:44.910> need<00:03:44.970> to<00:03:45.090> make

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:45.239 
here now we probably didn't need to make

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:47.089 
here now we probably didn't need to make
reservations<00:03:45.359> but<00:03:45.989> we<00:03:46.139> did<00:03:46.380> but<00:03:46.739> we<00:03:46.799> ate

00:03:47.089 --> 00:03:47.099 
reservations but we did but we ate

reservations but we did but we ate

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:49.709 
really early so it was not challenging

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:51.620 
really early so it was not challenging
at<00:03:49.829> all<00:03:49.950> to<00:03:50.220> get<00:03:50.340> in<00:03:50.489> and<00:03:50.700> get<00:03:50.790> out<00:03:50.849> in<00:03:51.150> fact<00:03:51.419> we

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:53.160 
were the only people there and so I was
