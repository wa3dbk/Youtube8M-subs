00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.210
 yes, our sharp finished and think about it 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.740
 how was that please today's 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.420
 I wanted to introduce myself today 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.780
 he has something to do with sheep again 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.549
 but chief culprit of this sheep climate 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.850
 It is called that all that is supposed to be the sheep 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:19.170
 In any case, there is still missing the tail 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:21.390
 and yes the knot 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.920
 Of course it will be natural too 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.160
 clearly that can not be missing the 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.830
 Censorship is not here if 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.420
 the light because it would be unfair 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:33.030
 oh so the recording is already us 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:36.450
 are now reviewing a new oz and 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.520
 it's about sheep so it's about the noise shops 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.700
 mod and what the ic can do after that 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.700
 intro 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:54.760
 So this music through things to this 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:56.530
 Sheep troops should be based 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:58.480
 I can do that for a screenshot 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:00.910
 show when you hit sheep broke 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:02.920
 should be a piece of meat troups at what 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:03.760
 Unfortunately, not me 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.130
 is working 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:08.110
 what I can tell you is, unfortunately, 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:09.520
 not say I have it exactly 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:11.140
 installed and I have this too 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.640
 meat this high office shop i can 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:16.840
 the theme show you strong theme sheep 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:18.760
 broken yes it drips minow wool and me 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:21.820
 I even uploaded ifx10 on it and 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:23.260
 to test that and it does not work 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:25.300
 I also like to go for the people 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:27.520
 you think it's game mode 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:28.869
 go out of the game engine and get that 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.460
 I also like to show fire 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:32.350
 here again as in the game place 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:33.790
 Enter this green want to make the 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:37.900
 So far , the wheels still stop 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:39.160
 little new update is so like 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:43.570
 You can see I beat the team 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:44.950
 broken there is unfortunately nothing here too 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:46.320
 not in the mode and plug the 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:49.030
 head suggest 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.880
 jaja internetten schÃ¤fchen I'm sorry 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:55.210
 So we have once the election office if 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:56.220
 that is not so cool from hunger 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:59.500
 here 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:01.630
 you can do that as far as I know two 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.280
 to hear three hearts and with her 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:04.960
 could four to five halls that was 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.520
 cool the highest roast 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:09.040
 can now like to show with times 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:11.290
 our beautiful nature items animation 

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:12.489
 if you burn something here then wood 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:14.620
 So you can pack it in and then 

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:16.690
 gets her yes, and this time a 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:18.549
 you actually get job from the lemm 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:20.860
 I do not know if it is with the model or 

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:22.360
 teaming up with 40 or have me wrong 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:23.080
 I can install it very briefly 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:26.560
 completely look 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:27.640
 may not be synonymous with frog universe yes 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.230
 so I do not have that in the 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.209
 minecraft I've packed the always 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:32.980
 to folders to murder perhaps packed 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:34.299
 you know how it works, I've 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.980
 you once imagined the times actually found 

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:37.540
 quite funny because I I've ever 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:39.190
 no wonder why sheep 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:40.900
 meat dry is actually a 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:42.670
 bit odd now there are 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.739
 finally what maybe feels too 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:47.560
 no, actually a very cool idea 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:49.540
 with the meat here and what of that 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:51.730
 Review please rate my sharp 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:53.470
 what do you think of so I think to 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:55.540
 also his visage but that 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:57.940
 I rate the place between 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:59.620
 points because an error has occurred 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:01.390
 which has to come from me and 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:01.780
 because I think you could be here 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:03.160
 perhaps 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.830
 Add a little more 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:07.870
 maybe I'm extra lamb 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:09.250
 be inserted or something like that 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:10.990
 suggestions for improvement what do you want 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:15.090
 improve write me the comments 

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:15.090
