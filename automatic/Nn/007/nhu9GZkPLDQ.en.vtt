00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:03.170
 ae 

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:06.399
 ae 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:22.320
 And then the doctor's okay with 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:24.480
 I here but have not seen the most welcome 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.669
 a video our channel today Monday 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.369
 and compromised will come out this new video 

00:00:26.669 --> 00:00:31.829
 I 'm here now after my practical class. 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.870
 technology and science 

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:35.910
 fully white white t-shirt 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.440
 white pants and white shoes because 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.239
 so you ask the rules my 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.280
 university for practical classes 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.020
 this is not a rule has faculties that 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.090
 little does care the cake is traveling 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.800
 for a practical lesson as long as they are 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.180
 for example by wearing closed shoes 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.860
 for a reason of being a rule of 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:53.250
 safety not to fall products 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:55.350
 chemical or knife to mix well but 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.750
 otherwise they do not care if the 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.850
 white red yellow clothing color 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.010
 old at last plus a video today 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.690
 personal talk about another subject 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.790
 I'll talk to you about it. 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.979
 It is doubtful of many students passing 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.320
 all those years of school 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.450
 its supported by parents 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.119
 Then they end up, yes. 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.680
 university they think just like me 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.140
 I will do to keep myself during the 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.580
 five years or six years of college and 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.560
 they become more dynamic as they were 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.210
 so far supported by parents who 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.680
 much more than a joint that will come from 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.619
 They will now have to put money into 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.900
 house with rent of expense account 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:33.630
 in general then answer that question 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.760
 Can you reconcile college? 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.740
 studies with work 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:39.930
 the answer is do not bring it first is 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.270
 depends on how organized 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.869
 you depend on how you plan your 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.729
 time 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:47.340
 if you are the kind of person who can 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.510
 being governed was your activity 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.250
 in a certain period of time after 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:52.200
 to spend a little more time there to 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.090
 organize your life its bark the most 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.920
 you'll probably be able to 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.259
 now if you can not organize your 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.119
 time if you are extremely messy and 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.830
 I hope to be much harder. 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.840
 course, it also depends on the course 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:05.520
 You mix right, in my case, I studied. 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.350
 medicine is very difficult to maintain 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.989
 I work because I have classes in the morning 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.709
 and in the afternoon every day from Monday to 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:13.140
 friday 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.860
 so I even work in my case I am 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.840
 dance teacher 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.180
 are the pre-vestibular courses and 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.920
 cent also, but 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.750
 my classes take place on Saturday 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.340
 morning that the time that I have available 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.860
 to serve them and also some 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:28.320
 students who end up teaching the choice 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.360
 chemistry 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:32.700
 we have given to private individuals 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.650
 English or know the child of the 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.580
 The building they live in knows they start 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.830
 to rotate the child with the tongue 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:39.390
 Portuguese consciences people is 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.280
 are more important matters. 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.510
 simple and such but sometimes parents 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.760
 pay for them to have a 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:46.920
 home monitoring is moreover 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:49.170
 I also had colleagues have colleagues who 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.640
 end up preferring to work at night 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.130
 some for example are trainees 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:56.250
 legislative assembly or work with 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:58.230
 marketing or finally, in a way, give 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:00.360
 his name has water not to make a 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:02.040
 Rio buck and so realize 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.750
 of the expenses of the house in the 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.850
 You that you do not worry so much about 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:07.950
 this when you pass the entrance exam and 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:09.450
 Foca blurred pass in the college entrance examination 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:11.190
 its what you will probably 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:13.050
 catching is not on your side had a 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:14.580
 touch manage because if they saw that 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:15.600
 Are you really working? 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:18.090
 worried about having a good training 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:19.890
 professional they will get out of there 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:21.690
 if you do not frame if you are still 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:22.500
 to spout something else you can 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:24.540
 do 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:26.580
 besides medicine, even when you 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:28.440
 finish studying a subject and such 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:30.390
 I'm teacher can create empathy and you 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:32.730
 And then in the next semester when you 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:34.560
 do the prosecution it will probably go 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:36.299
 apply a written test and will do 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.650
 an interview with you to know which 

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:39.750
 schedules and has available to meet 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:41.820
 the students of the other Latin phase arriving 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:43.019
 in spite of his son he will talk 

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:45.330
 You too think your 

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:47.700
 commitment knows how good you have been 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:49.799
 your big notes and messi know if you 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:51.870
 really has the profile of a broker and 

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:53.700
 if he feels you have this profile 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:56.190
 He'll ask you, he'll call me. 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:57.989
 for your then much discipline and then mine 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:59.820
 friend you will receive 7 throughout the month 

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:01.530
 language money monitoring scholarships 

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:03.330
 very loud but sure to help 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:05.160
 you stay in university 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:07.140
 Furthermore in many colleges 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:09.330
 especially the federal universities 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:11.130
 and 100 scholarships for those who 

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:12.989
 are lacking and there are also other 

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:14.910
 bags to be monitor to help in the 

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:17.459
 discipline is microbiology and 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:19.560
 parasitology is basic support of the 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:21.350
 life is the basic support of life for 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:23.300
 example is very interesting and beautiful 

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:25.460
 because you see the warm and the passing 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:28.610
 by the college steps and then you 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:30.440
 calluses check pressure you help them 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:32.300
 learn to do rcp nÃ© 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:34.340
 CPR you 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:37.430
 helps to undo the chest compression at 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:38.840
 commonly called the heart massage 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:40.790
 It's very cool, you keep on keeping 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:42.530
 contact with these things as well 

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:44.450
 be important in your medical practice 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:46.430
 now if you do not have the support of your 

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:49.310
 Parents help you with the bills if you do not 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:51.710
 can be a monitor my friend one 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:53.990
 Hugs to you, it's complicated, I do not know. 

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:55.700
 I'll do it but it's cold, look at you. 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:57.650
 because who has the power to 

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:59.690
 willingness and motivation to 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:01.010
 see the future there see the place with 

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:02.510
 that the goals that you 

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:04.100
 achieve 

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:05.960
 It motivates you in a way you 

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:09.320
 feels excited to perform 

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:10.880
 the goal then focus on this know is 

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:13.250
 possible to reconcile study and 

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:15.800
 It's not easy for everyone to do their 

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:18.920
 ninth if you study law or intend to 

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:20.720
 give right or administration marketing 

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:22.910
 mouth to another a course that is not 

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:25.400
 integral with medicine is possible 

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:27.320
 work part time study myself 

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:29.270
 I have an older sister and she 

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:31.130
 attended college and she during college 

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:33.410
 whole during all periods it 

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:35.570
 It has always been necessary to think 

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:36.830
 different modalities of the profession and 

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:38.510
 It was very interesting because they 

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:40.370
 meeting a guy in the area can see 

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:42.170
 exactly what she would like to do and 

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:44.270
 at the same time also had a practice and 

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:45.680
 a buck there at the end of the month 

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:47.480
 something that I, for example, medicine 

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:49.400
 it is difficult to bottle because it teaches 

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:50.360
 the stages that we perform are not 

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:52.430
 remunerated 

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:54.620
 so I do stage more for example 

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:56.600
 wins so but also to acquire 

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:59.780
 another form in pepper to my generation and 

00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:01.430
 of course as always for 

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:04.220
 my parents who are the ones who are looking for 

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:06.050
 part of my clothes, not personal and 

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:07.400
 about this subject I hope 

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:09.640
 clarify the main doubts of 

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:12.170
 I know it's not easy to work. 

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:14.420
 sometimes we get very tired in 

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:16.820
 home at night really is taking a shower 

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:18.500
 and eat and be quiet because I could 

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:21.710
 I studied all of myself and did things all day. 

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:23.840
 whole but needy to have health in 

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:25.760
 force knows have to have willpower 

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:27.310
 It has to be cool to make it work. 

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:29.170
 our life to do with 

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:31.210
 our plans because we are the 

00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:32.500
 only responsible for our future and 

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:34.570
 a conversation sculpture build 

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:35.410
 now here in our sacrifice our 

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:36.760
 each day 

00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:38.860
 so if you want to do a college 

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:40.810
 will need to work to maintain or 

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:42.640
 at least to help us take costs 

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:44.860
 sure that you are far from you 

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:45.490
 spend enough on account of it 

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:47.530
 good 

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:51.060
 A big hug to everyone, a good kiss. 

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:51.060
 big until the next
