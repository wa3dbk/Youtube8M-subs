00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.080
 Hey man! Where is the orange? 

00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:04.000
 This is supposed to be a surprise party 

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
 Well, surprise, it never shows up 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.580
 I think he is stuck in crisis 

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:09.080
 Brother, we live in the kitchen! 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:10.640
 I do not believe this 

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:12.460
 This is his birthday party and now he is not here? 

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:14.500
 Hmmmmmm, there is no one else 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:15.800
 this is not true 

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:16.840
 The dwarf apple made it 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:18.160
 It means small apple 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:19.580
 Hooo! Who came this 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:21.040
 The dwarf apple inside the cake 

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:22.380
 The small apple 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:23.620
 Why do you do this? 

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:25.320
 Well, watch out. This is my birthday party 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:27.300
 He will jump out of the cake and sing for the orange 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.080
 You do not do this at Christmas parties 

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:30.120
 Do not do ?? 

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:31.080
 No 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.500
 Does that mean I can go out now? 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.500
 Hi? Hi? 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.000
 Hi, sorry for the delay 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.000
 Hi? 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.700
 Hi, I'm a Marshmallow candy 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:39.700
 Can you be my friend 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:42.320
 Take me out of the cake and I will be your favorite friend 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:43.340
 YAYAAI !!! 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:44.380
 To sing a song, dear friend 

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:46.040
 Man, I'm stuck in the cake 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:47.540
 Ooh, I do not know this song 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:48.540
 One will be invented 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:49.660
 (Old man tone) Marshmallow candy here 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:50.860

 Man, I'm stuck in the cake 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:54.300
 (Laughter) 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.340
 Hello, what are you talking about? 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:57.040
 I'm not late, I'm an orange (laughs) 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.420
 Hello, you are here 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:01.180
 Happy Birthday! 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:02.760
 Yaaaaaaa! 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.460
 YOUNGAY !! 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:06.200
 Happy Birthday! 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.820
 Wait, birthday of? 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.280
 Waaow, I did not go before to a birthday party 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:14.750
 what should we do? 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:16.120
 This is your birthday, O orange 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:17.420
 You can do what you want 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:18.420
 Oh really?? 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:19.420
 Sure, my friend 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:20.750
 Well I want to practice shooting 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:22.500
 Hmmmmmmm .... well 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.000
 (Suction, spit) 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.200
 Direct infection 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.200
 Hello, I just woke up ..... 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.700
 (Resentment, screams) 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:29.900
 Huwao, 100 percent direct injury 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:31.250
 (Laughter) 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:32.860
 (Loud noise) This is not nice, man. This is not nice 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.920
 (Laughter) You look like a marshmallow man 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.580
 Hey! To sing a song 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:37.580
 Helium gas is foolish 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:39.580
 Youth, why not open some of the gifts 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:41.280
 Is it possible to start the cake? 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:43.440
 The orange, (haste) 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:47.000
 (Normal voice): Rapture, we decided to bring you something for as long as you wanted 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.160
 Owoh, 

00:01:50.208 --> 00:01:51.458
 -A hot tub filled with molded? 

00:01:51.458 --> 00:01:52.792
 No, this is gross. 

00:01:52.792 --> 00:01:54.500
 This is something I've always wanted. 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:55.500
 remember? 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:56.667

 No, it's not your birthday party. 

00:02:02.417 --> 00:02:08.325

00:02:08.325 --> 00:02:10.625
 Oh, it's a pogo stick. 

00:02:10.625 --> 00:02:11.625

 - [Laughing] This tickles. 

00:02:15.333 --> 00:02:16.375
 Stop eating me, dowry. 

00:02:16.375 --> 00:02:17.375
 [Laughing] 

00:02:17.375 --> 00:02:18.542
 -Wow, he is too small. 

00:02:18.542 --> 00:02:20.625
 Well, I wanted a dowry. 

00:02:20.625 --> 00:02:22.042
 -He knows how to play Nintendo? 

00:02:22.042 --> 00:02:23.875
 No, it's a dowry. 

00:02:23.875 --> 00:02:26.583
 Oh, well, I wanted a pony that can play Wei. 

00:02:26.583 --> 00:02:27.833

00:02:27.833 --> 00:02:29.500
 -Hey, what about me? 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:30.958
 It gets a little hot here. 

00:02:30.958 --> 00:02:32.583
 -Uh oh. -Whoa! - For folly. 

00:02:32.583 --> 00:02:33.833
 Oh no, my best friend on fire. 

00:02:33.833 --> 00:02:36.167
 , Quick, blow them out before the Apple Dwarf burns. 

00:02:36.167 --> 00:02:37.583
 The Apple Dwarf and what to do in a cupcake? 

00:02:37.583 --> 00:02:39.000
 - It's Little Apple! 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.326
 [Screams] 

00:02:41.326 --> 00:02:44.375
 Take me out, take me out! 

00:02:45.575 --> 00:02:46.875
 -Whoa! 

00:02:46.875 --> 00:02:47.875
 -Aah. 

00:02:47.875 --> 00:02:49.458
 -Phew, that's much better. 

00:02:49.458 --> 00:02:50.875
 - Do you get hot from here or are they just me? 

00:02:50.875 --> 00:02:52.958

 -I can see my house from here. 

00:03:00.083 --> 00:03:02.958
 -Whoa, talk about being in the spotlight. [Laugh] 

00:03:02.958 --> 00:03:05.125

00:03:18.792 --> 00:03:21.042
 I just wanted to fall down and say happy birthday-- 

00:03:21.042 --> 00:03:22.333
 Oh foolishness. 

00:03:22.333 --> 00:03:25.000
