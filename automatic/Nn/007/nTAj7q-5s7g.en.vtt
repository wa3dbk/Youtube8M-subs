00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:15.530
 great game that is deadly kombat 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:18.230
 classic and this is the complete edition 

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:20.760
 then here we have it from the page 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:22.950
 game torrents 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.930
 I'll leave the link in the 

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:27.120
 description of this video 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.720
 and here is the game we are going to download 

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:29.720
 by torrent 

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:32.800
 it is done like this 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:37.830
 that we have download the torrent when 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:40.460
 we are going to give you the tournament 

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:40.460
 Double click 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:46.920
 that will open us directly the program 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:48.719
 and torrent that we could here 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.280
 then are the files that we are going to 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:54.280
 to download 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:57.610
 90 and something 100 megabyte files that 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:59.769
 we will accept and here we will 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:03.540
 start the download is going to delay us 

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:03.540
 you have to have patience 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:15.310
 because once the story is downloaded 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:15.310
 we will have a folder like this 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.770
 with all those files that we've already seen 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:25.789
 when installed in the sector 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:28.710
 all these files are the game but 

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:32.220
 what do we have to be let's give it 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:34.710
 double click on the first or the first 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:37.590
 it always has to be the first one we go to 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:40.860
 see here selecting the folder that is 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:44.010
 call p2p in combat 9 and let's 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:46.590
 to be told to extract 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:49.200
 when we give to extract we are going to look 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.960
 a most advisable folder is that 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:56.340
 we do it on the local disk if we go to 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:58.440
 ce local disk and leave it there will 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.240
 to accept 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:04.410
 and I already have it then it will not give 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:06.530
 and I have a p2p bed 

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:08.310
 9 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:11.490
 there is 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:14.490
 once done that 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:16.830
 let's open this is important that 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:19.380
 have installed and sting can not 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:23.190
 search with a normal search engine lean 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:25.840
 download sting 2013 and they will have it 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:29.210
 they install they register look 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:31.610
 once we have the skin 

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:33.680
 we have to add our game 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:35.960
 installed to our game that we 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:38.030
 decompress deadly kombat east of what 

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:40.700
 otherwise it will not work 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:43.010
 we have to give it here in games add 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:46.390
 a game that is not my library 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:49.030
 the last option that we already have 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:51.750
 and we have to give KakÃ¡ not going to 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:55.160
 appear we are never going to give you look 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:58.910
 when we give you look 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:02.120
 we have to obviously look for the place 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:05.540
 where we store it where we decompress 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:08.180
 the folder then in my case I'm going to 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:12.350
 give him a local disk ce and I'll look 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:15.200
 my folder that is p 2 pm bout 9 you 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:17.270
 we give here and we go to safety 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.840
 folder that says disk contained in the 

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:22.950
 pc to know 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:26.599
 let's say here and we give this file 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:26.599
 what is m po 

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:31.240
 what is an application we are going to open 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:33.550
 once 

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:36.390
 we must open we seem here in the list 

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:39.720
 as in the first order 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:42.950
 there he is with a chulito we are going to give him 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.950
 add selected 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:50.690
 once the selection appears here 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:52.580
 and we're going to give him play and that's it 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:56.090
 And if they do not do it this way, 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:57.860
 will work if they download cracks either 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:01.160
 they will work the only way to do it 

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:04.460
 it is from this by means of many sting 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:07.710
