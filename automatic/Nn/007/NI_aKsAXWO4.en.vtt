for<00:02:43.409> silencing<00:02:44.409> the<00:02:44.709> volume<00:02:45.220> so<00:02:45.430> now<00:02:45.549> I<00:02:45.579> can

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:45.639 
for silencing the volume so now I can

00:02:45.639 --> 00:02:49.530 
for silencing the volume so now I can
sound<00:02:45.970> or<00:02:46.680> you<00:02:47.680> know<00:02:47.799> turn<00:02:48.340> on<00:02:48.459> the<00:02:48.609> sound<00:02:49.030> just

activate<00:02:58.359> the<00:02:58.629> orientation<00:02:59.230> lock<00:02:59.349> so<00:03:00.989> that's

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:01.989 
activate the orientation lock so that's

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:03.360 
activate the orientation lock so that's
a<00:03:02.109> difference<00:03:02.439> there<00:03:02.620> for<00:03:02.889> the<00:03:03.010> physical
