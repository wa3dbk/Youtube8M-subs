00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:11.560
 good today I'm going to make a video of 

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:14.920
 beginners in the game mario kart well 

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:18.279
 that when you watch the video please do not 

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:19.900
 I want no comment that says that 

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:22.240
 I knew it 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:23.430
 Okay, well, we are doing slow 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.490
 what 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.970
 when that is slow in the minute 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:32.200
 envy 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:34.989
 when it still comes back it's worth a menu 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:39.360
 very simple so we're going to make it a 

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:39.360
 now we have options 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:45.800
 we have configuration that 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:47.290
 to change the sound 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:51.480
 Y 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:53.410
 keep looking for good friends 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:57.390
 change 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:01:01.030
 of the everything that is your name and the shield 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:03.129
 while the other data in this case does not 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:05.770
 we are going to play 

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:09.840
 record 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:12.159
 we have the three tests 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:19.030
 that are not seen here 

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:22.930
 every cup hurts every dinner record 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:26.650
 this and finish it but good is not very 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:29.049
 important the important thing if 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:32.360
 you want to play with other players all 

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:35.270
 here will connect and now 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:39.500
 can play here is usually played 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:41.540
 with a player then you get 5 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:44.870
 purchases 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:51.070
 I'm going to explain to you a little bit about this is the 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:55.260
 speed goes slow normal and super fast 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:56.720
 and this is the super fast but everything is 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:59.780
 invested 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:02.930
 Olive, I know , I think they 're going 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:05.630
 unlocking I do not remember anymore but I think 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:08.149
 that when you take x time with this 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:11.150
 you unlock this and so all with the 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:12.520
 other good test some 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:16.660
 your 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:20.460
 tells you to choose a player and then a 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:22.650
 car but it is taught up 

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:24.950
 this is so I think they are going 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.950
 unblocking 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:30.820
 sites 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:33.630
 well there is not a variety of cars 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:37.560
 I always choose the same 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:39.370
 because it has enough wind 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:43.810
 speed 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:48.310
 well everything perfectly you give guarantees and 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:53.340
 now lets you choose the competition that 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:56.090
 up you get the likes 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.090
 brand new 

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:05.959
 well there are a few so if you have 

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:08.130
 time you can do it ok let's see 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:11.450
 time trial 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:11.450
 the time trial 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:15.170
 OK the same 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:25.120
 then choose this so you can 

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:25.120
 choose 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:33.060
 the scenario that you want for example 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:35.380
 let's do a test this is my 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:38.610
 Favourite 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:38.610
 and good to enter 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.530
 and what game 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:55.709
 let's see another contraction is versus 

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:05.420
 then he tells you to choose the speed what 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:05.420
 what we have said before 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:15.910
 in the difficulty of the opponents 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:15.910
 then s 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:26.039
 that you can choose the circuits online 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:29.540
 thorium and here says you win centuries or by 

00:04:26.039 --> 00:04:32.930
 vitor not by point this cashier 

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:35.800
 and teams then choose and up 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:35.800
 they form the teams 

00:04:36.259 --> 00:04:41.270
 Well yes you see how it works already 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:45.440
 tested 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:48.330
 battle there are two types of battles above 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:51.270
 he explains them to you 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:54.689
 battle of balloons explode the crazy ones of 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:57.180
 your rivals using objects if all 

00:04:54.689 --> 00:05:01.160
 these balloons and explode lose you will blow 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:04.280
 in the microphone to inflate your blogs 

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:08.380
 and solo career collects more soles than 

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:11.780
 nobody steals the suns of your rivals for 

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:15.200
 add them to your collection will be ejected to 

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:18.740
 the ones that have the least suns, well, you're going 

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:23.129
 testing is worth when you enter 

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:25.020
 choose again to speak 

00:05:23.129 --> 00:05:28.830
 my daughters 

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:31.440
 here at different levels that I level 6 

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:35.759
 I have not done it but well you enter a 

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:40.620
 level and you have two different tests 

00:05:35.759 --> 00:05:42.550
 then as if we say the boss of the 

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:45.790
 class 

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:49.980
 If you want here, what are we going to do if 

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:49.980
 you want one to try 

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:57.380
 I have not played a game for a long time 

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:08.860
 which is difficult to play with recording 

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:08.860
 it's good to go through there 

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:13.250
 with which I have the camera 

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:19.199
 but good 

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:23.630
 the version of pass to all 

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:29.479
 good 

00:06:27.289 --> 00:06:31.779
 now I will stay here as a bad but 

00:06:29.479 --> 00:06:31.779
 good 

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:40.600
 this fact but good 

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:40.600
 with the camera and the nerves 

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:47.159
 that you fail you always fail 

00:06:44.409 --> 00:06:47.159
 good 

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:57.470
 Well, this already I think we have already done it 

00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:59.390
 everything yes it is already 

00:06:57.470 --> 00:07:03.070
 this is a video for beginners 

00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:07.500
 I hope it has been helpful for you 

00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:07.500
 and that you enjoy greater
