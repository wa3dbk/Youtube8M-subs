 believe it I like it more p 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.570
 the to the exploration in this kind of 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:33.780
 it's so to speak 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:39.180
 explosion pack that directly in the deadpool safari on it 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:40.830
 percent 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:45.340
 operates mini and that is practically for the pri to point to then still 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:47.450
 there is no other half to the patient 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:49.120
 very very very very culé and 5 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:53.070
 that we have work we do not have what we are and create we reiterate several 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.970
 windows for example here is the aeee 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:57.240
 the homepage of what you see 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.490
 ap houston we have several windows and good was mind then in the direction of 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:02.860
 eta for a web 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:07.000
 already a day I have a team of pochettino and before the arms to ecuador in more 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.130
 thorny morning appear 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:13.920
 the loaded mtp cepeda a lot of that of the barge that you have but it works 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.069
 very very well works very cool for example that is not seen 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:21.999
 you can invert how many windows we have and we only want one uu the 

00:02:21.999 --> 00:02:24.020
 three that we have here the 3 chestnuts 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:25.960
 here we can add that 

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:28.980
 I was looking for action when checking how home page 

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:33.169
 really this famous April plot both in safari as in other send it 

00:02:33.169 --> 00:02:33.959
 polymer 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:38.280
 postal to buehrle facebook on twitter bring many hypotheses and see it 

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:43.769
 can be more applications within this browser than the same safari t me 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:46.169
 scored contains the default tab 

00:02:46.169 --> 00:02:49.260
 for this and after several little things for example here we can 

00:02:49.809 --> 00:02:50.939
 percent 

00:02:50.939 --> 00:02:53.420
 part the goal to mark several things 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:57.100
 make bad use to the same screen for example let's go here there's lithium 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:59.990
 the mosquitia equity we are going to make this one 

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:03.190
 a little a minor what is he the outline of letter 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:06.090
 here we can be a little later for people who do not see that they are a 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:07.479
 little sheraton as 

00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:10.969
 percent and fortunately this is not my case we have to 

00:03:10.969 --> 00:03:14.609
 as we want to tactically possess this we are increasing 

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:19.730
 the sum that is a thing that is very cool the goal this is already given 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:22.100
 the break in consumption is constant 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:26.450
 quite broad of those of the letters that do not get lost absolving in nothing not 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:31.490
 just looking to create this can pay the bills amos is smaller than 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:33.820
 the three-year wait 

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:36.339
 the application for example we can stop this 

00:03:36.339 --> 00:03:40.149
 percent in full windows and others appear aspen the shores of the explorer 

00:03:40.149 --> 00:03:42.410
 give the super super super concrete 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:46.120
 the music here will tell us which one we want the word pop 

00:03:47.119 --> 00:03:50.450
 we click and the screen closes, not to stay in Cusco in 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:54.849
 sometimes you can give for example the la personación of what is to the pacino a 

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:59.479
 the page on the side in the left york team frame that is to load 

00:03:59.479 --> 00:04:03.060
 and that's why we have to present it again 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:05.319
 by themselves and they see a 

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:09.120
 juancho to represent to give much more quickly and comfortably the sword 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:10.079
 the official 

00:04:10.079 --> 00:04:11.679
 a lot and this one 

00:04:11.679 --> 00:04:15.209
 more than bolón timpo employment as tablet ipad that shows us more tabs 

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:20.659
 in those we appear lemko a recurring search interest list by 

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:21.549
 so to speak 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:22.639
 Mom is horrible 

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:25.800
 entin people live and ccoo and quitéria and that garlic 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:26.710
 the ticket or 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:30.009
 she and of theoreticians or museums for example fusca reclusorios 

00:04:30.009 --> 00:04:33.009
 let's look is just the one that 15 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:37.699
 solar 15 wolves correctly in ten guys 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:44.210
 to see what he asks us to appear soros and there is already being the percent 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:47.699
 the search and there's all of them, well, it's great and simoes 

00:04:47.699 --> 00:04:49.219
 a qatar puncture 

00:04:49.219 --> 00:04:54.079
 and I saw on TV is what I do that I like from the explorer flight in 

00:04:54.079 --> 00:04:57.719
 yes of what is the current one then recognizes me later as a touch screen 

00:04:57.719 --> 00:05:01.689
 this type this presentation to me I do not like at all is a very benefit 

00:05:01.689 --> 00:05:02.250
 ugly 

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:04.270
 the mosquitia in you show 

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:09.330
 what the writer is and how the desk elvio knows and here it is already 

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:12.560

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:17.900
 our people that screens well this is this the scout or those that the 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:19.659
 second is all that goes out to 

00:05:19.659 --> 00:05:22.789
 what is given to the paper after what it was 

00:05:22.789 --> 00:05:26.990
 this opera mini work for me is not so much for cáceres this sensor the 15 

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:31.099

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:41.270
 have it in mind for those who postulated the closing visions and revise 

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:43.069
