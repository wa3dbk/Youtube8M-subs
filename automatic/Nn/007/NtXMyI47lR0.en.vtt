00:00:14.989 --> 00:00:17.970
 sta 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:23.449
 escarole granada pacala or a mac or pasta olive black paprika garlic oil salt 

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:24.699
 The vinegar 

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:27.990
 are the ingredients of our salad 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.829
 d is carola with cod justmad option to nothing 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:35.730
 The first thing we are going to do is cut 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.480
 the escarole we do it by hand 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:43.090
 to prevent the West from being cut by the knife 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:46.650
 and we put it in the cold water 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:48.320
 water with ice 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.870
 because yes we get it to improve its appearance is something similar 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:54.740
 when we put 

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:58.940
 some flowers that we have cut in a vase with dismissed abortion revives 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.600
 that's why we hope to achieve it with this cold water 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:07.780
 we add little by little other two small escarole 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:13.060
 the lettuce family is more bitter this winter 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:17.320
 and this delicious 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:20.850
 and we cut the jobs to the mines 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:25.960
 with them we will make a sofrito 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.440
 what will be the dressing of our slave and you will see that we are going out 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.450
 with the eyes the paste of black olives 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:37.470
 i paprika 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.470
 good prepare the oil mind is warming 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.880
 It's our turn to sound the pomegranate that is a task 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:48.240
 it's difficult because the pomegranate 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.319
 has a very tough skin, those numbers are not easy to remove 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:58.080
 you have to discard the white part from the homes because it is very bitter 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.770
 try to take out the Indian grains 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:04.159
 good the hot oil we think the garlic to the pan 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:08.510
 and when they go brown they begin to adore 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.549
 we add a little vinegar 

00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:15.479
 the pasta of the black olive 

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:17.199
 and the paprika 

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:20.359
 and we will not mix everything well 

00:02:20.359 --> 00:02:22.439
 I repeat that it will be 

00:02:22.439 --> 00:02:25.909
 the dressing of our salad 

00:02:25.909 --> 00:02:30.939
 With spite we will avoid the garlic and we can strain everything to avoid 

00:02:31.719 --> 00:02:33.299
 the impurities 

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:35.679
 salt ours is carola 

00:02:35.679 --> 00:02:38.759
 i the caleÃ±o that we just prepared 

00:02:41.679 --> 00:02:44.679
 the numbers of the grenade above 

00:02:45.539 --> 00:02:48.539
 and with the help of a metal ring 

00:02:49.369 --> 00:02:52.019
 let's prepare 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:54.569
 temper t 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:57.239
 place it for that 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:00.379
 the metal ring the eye we bouquets inside 

00:03:00.899 --> 00:03:03.899
 with those smoked cod fillets 

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:07.829
 p - it would work if we do not have the desalination plant 

00:03:09.369 --> 00:03:12.779
 we lined them well inside 

00:03:12.779 --> 00:03:15.709
 and when we complete the operation 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:20.159
 we will introduce the salad by completing the biemh down 

00:03:22.179 --> 00:03:23.869
 for species 

00:03:23.869 --> 00:03:26.789
 in this way this is not a state 

00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:29.859
 when we come back we do well 

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:31.709
 the loans 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:36.159
 and then we turn it around when we have it in the plan we turn it around 

00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:38.499
 we are clear with care 

00:03:38.499 --> 00:03:41.499
 and so we have the cod list 

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:43.299
 outside 

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:45.509
 making us that if you let you 

00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:47.819
 in the whole salad inside 

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:50.250
 let's go over our recipe 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:54.380
 escarole with cod granada and left written we need escarole cod 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:57.940
 desalted pomegranate paprika garlic green pasta 

00:03:58.949 --> 00:04:04.799
 vinegar oil salt and pepper clean the escarole that cut it into pieces 

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:07.879
 We tear the cod in pieces once salted 

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:09.969
 will unleash the pomegranate 

00:04:09.969 --> 00:04:14.230
 Fry the rolled garlic together with the olive paste and the paprika 

00:04:14.979 --> 00:04:16.559
 and we add vinegar 

00:04:16.559 --> 00:04:18.859
 mix the streetlights with the grenade 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:23.819
 and we put over the cod that we already came with the garlic sauce 

00:04:23.819 --> 00:04:27.899
 we have used the metal ring to make us much stronger 

00:04:28.599 --> 00:04:30.750
 I hope you like that you enjoy
