these<00:02:38.870> two<00:02:38.930> zipper<00:02:39.470> pulls<00:02:39.770> mainly<00:02:40.400> because

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:40.520 
these two zipper pulls mainly because

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:42.550 
these two zipper pulls mainly because
just<00:02:40.940> kind<00:02:41.060> of<00:02:41.180> another<00:02:41.480> security<00:02:41.900> feature<00:02:42.320> on

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:45.050 
here so the zipper can't come down and

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:47.440 
here so the zipper can't come down and
things<00:02:45.230> can<00:02:45.440> fall<00:02:45.650> out<00:02:45.950> or<00:02:46.310> one<00:02:46.910> of<00:02:47.030> my<00:02:47.150> kids

things can fall out or one of my kids

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:49.330 
things can fall out or one of my kids
can't<00:02:47.810> grab<00:02:48.230> it<00:02:48.470> and<00:02:48.709> everything<00:02:49.160> will<00:02:49.280> fall

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
can't grab it and everything will fall

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:51.729 
can't grab it and everything will fall
out<00:02:49.730> so<00:02:50.300> I<00:02:50.480> just<00:02:50.720> like<00:02:51.080> kind<00:02:51.320> of<00:02:51.410> attaching
