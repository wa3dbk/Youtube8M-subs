don't<00:03:02.220> know<00:03:02.400> if<00:03:02.519> you<00:03:02.580> can<00:03:02.700> see<00:03:02.910> it<00:03:02.970> or<00:03:03.090> not<00:03:03.120> but

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:03.320 
don't know if you can see it or not but

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:10.009 
don't know if you can see it or not but
man<00:03:04.320> is<00:03:04.590> it<00:03:04.769> hard<00:03:05.130> so<00:03:07.040> anyhow<00:03:08.060> a<00:03:09.060> dug<00:03:09.750> six

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:10.019 
man is it hard so anyhow a dug six

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:11.840 
man is it hard so anyhow a dug six
buckets<00:03:10.230> out<00:03:10.470> the<00:03:10.709> first<00:03:10.890> time<00:03:11.160> and<00:03:11.459> it<00:03:11.670> looked

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850 
buckets out the first time and it looked

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:25.430 
buckets out the first time and it looked
promising<00:03:12.890> so<00:03:13.890> I<00:03:15.920> would<00:03:23.299> hold<00:03:24.299> up<00:03:24.450> normally<00:03:25.350> I

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
promising so I would hold up normally I

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.350 
promising so I would hold up normally I
do<00:03:25.500> a<00:03:25.590> ten<00:03:25.890> run<00:03:26.100> bucket<00:03:26.489> but<00:03:26.820> the<00:03:26.940> dig<00:03:27.060> was<00:03:27.239> so

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:27.360 
do a ten run bucket but the dig was so

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:33.680 
do a ten run bucket but the dig was so
hard<00:03:27.570> I<00:03:27.660> got<00:03:27.750> lazy<00:03:28.019> and<00:03:28.170> only<00:03:28.410> did<00:03:28.560> six

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:36.590 

hopefully<00:03:34.230> that's<00:03:34.470> blown<00:03:34.830> over<00:03:35.070> and<00:03:35.600> I'm

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:36.600 
hopefully that's blown over and I'm

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.210 
hopefully that's blown over and I'm
gonna<00:03:36.750> run<00:03:36.930> something<00:03:37.170> through<00:03:37.740> the<00:03:38.010> drywall

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
gonna run something through the drywall

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:39.920 
gonna run something through the drywall
sure<00:03:38.640> so<00:03:38.790> you<00:03:38.910> can<00:03:39.060> see<00:03:39.270> what<00:03:39.540> we're<00:03:39.690> doing

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
sure so you can see what we're doing

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:44.870 
sure so you can see what we're doing
there<00:03:40.670> dry<00:03:41.670> washer<00:03:43.190> is<00:03:44.190> this<00:03:44.520> contraption

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:44.880 
there dry washer is this contraption

00:03:44.880 --> 00:04:09.920 
there dry washer is this contraption
right<00:03:45.150> here<00:04:03.560> I<00:04:06.800> for<00:04:07.800> the<00:04:07.980> material<00:04:08.900> into<00:04:09.900> the

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:09.930 
right here I for the material into the

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:14.840 
right here I for the material into the
top<00:04:10.910> get<00:04:11.910> a<00:04:11.940> head<00:04:13.220> smaller<00:04:14.220> than<00:04:14.430> a<00:04:14.520> half-inch

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:14.850 
top get a head smaller than a half-inch

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:21.830 
top get a head smaller than a half-inch
goes<00:04:15.180> through<00:04:18.500> the<00:04:19.500> warm<00:04:19.739> air<00:04:20.450> past<00:04:21.450> the<00:04:21.630> fan

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:21.840 
goes through the warm air past the fan

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:23.480 
goes through the warm air past the fan
blade<00:04:22.200> it<00:04:22.410> has<00:04:22.590> a<00:04:22.620> weight<00:04:22.890> on<00:04:23.070> it<00:04:23.220> so<00:04:23.250> the

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:23.490 
blade it has a weight on it so the

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:27.210 
blade it has a weight on it so the
shakes

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:27.220 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:31.440 

so<00:04:27.820> it<00:04:27.940> separates<00:04:28.270> the<00:04:29.760> heavy<00:04:30.760> minerals<00:04:31.210> from

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:31.450 
so it separates the heavy minerals from

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:33.900 
so it separates the heavy minerals from
the<00:04:31.540> light<00:04:31.690> once<00:04:32.070> it<00:04:33.070> comes<00:04:33.280> out<00:04:33.430> here<00:04:33.700> at<00:04:33.820> the

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:33.910 
the light once it comes out here at the

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:40.740 
the light once it comes out here at the
bottom<00:04:34.800> as<00:04:35.800> you<00:04:35.950> can<00:04:36.130> see<00:04:38.760> tailing<00:04:39.760> pile<00:04:40.000> and

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:40.750 
bottom as you can see tailing pile and

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:44.130 
bottom as you can see tailing pile and
let's<00:04:41.200> grow<00:04:42.330> one<00:04:43.330> of<00:04:43.420> the<00:04:43.480> most<00:04:43.690> important

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:44.140 
let's grow one of the most important

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:47.250 
let's grow one of the most important
things<00:04:44.290> that<00:04:44.620> you<00:04:44.770> learn<00:04:45.000> isn't<00:04:46.000> a<00:04:46.260> novice

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:47.260 
things that you learn isn't a novice

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:48.660 
things that you learn isn't a novice
