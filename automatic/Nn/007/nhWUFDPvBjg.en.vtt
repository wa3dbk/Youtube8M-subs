in<00:00:22.419> nature<00:00:22.689> as<00:00:22.779> you<00:00:22.900> can<00:00:23.020> see<00:00:23.169> from<00:00:23.289> the

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:23.439 
in nature as you can see from the

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:25.619 
in nature as you can see from the
designs<00:00:23.770> it<00:00:23.919> very<00:00:24.160> very<00:00:24.730> much<00:00:24.880> is<00:00:25.239> foreigner

00:00:27.389 --> 00:00:27.399 
in nature but I described it as

00:00:27.399 --> 00:00:29.429 
in nature but I described it as
something<00:00:28.029> looks<00:00:28.270> very<00:00:28.599> similar<00:00:28.840> to<00:00:29.020> the<00:00:29.169> map

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:29.439 
something looks very similar to the map

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:32.549 
something looks very similar to the map
Narrows<00:00:30.040> now<00:00:30.700> from<00:00:31.390> watching<00:00:31.960> this<00:00:32.079> game<00:00:32.320> play

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:32.559 
Narrows now from watching this game play

Narrows now from watching this game play
I<00:00:32.800> also<00:00:33.129> i<00:00:33.340> do<00:00:33.399> agree<00:00:33.820> with<00:00:33.910> that<00:00:34.030> but<00:00:34.210> i<00:00:34.270> also

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:34.480 
I also i do agree with that but i also

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.810 
I also i do agree with that but i also
think<00:00:34.690> that<00:00:35.110> it<00:00:35.289> resembles<00:00:35.800> the<00:00:36.160> halo<00:00:36.370> 3<00:00:36.640> map

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:36.820 
think that it resembles the halo 3 map

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:39.240 
think that it resembles the halo 3 map
construct<00:00:37.450> as<00:00:37.629> well<00:00:37.930> as<00:00:38.140> this<00:00:38.410> map<00:00:38.680> has<00:00:38.860> lots

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:39.250 
construct as well as this map has lots

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:40.610 
construct as well as this map has lots
of<00:00:39.399> levels<00:00:39.579> and<00:00:39.850> is<00:00:39.969> described<00:00:40.360> as

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
of levels and is described as

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.229 
of levels and is described as
multi-level<00:00:41.620> with<00:00:41.920> some<00:00:42.160> open<00:00:42.550> areas<00:00:42.910> areas

00:00:43.229 --> 00:00:43.239 
multi-level with some open areas areas

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:45.360 
multi-level with some open areas areas
that<00:00:43.660> are<00:00:43.750> similar<00:00:44.079> to<00:00:44.230> narrow<00:00:44.710> so<00:00:45.010> think<00:00:45.310> of

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:45.370 
that are similar to narrow so think of

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:46.680 
that are similar to narrow so think of
it<00:00:45.489> that<00:00:45.520> way<00:00:45.700> it's<00:00:45.970> very<00:00:46.150> forerunner<00:00:46.600> in

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:46.690 
it that way it's very forerunner in

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:48.960 
it that way it's very forerunner in
nature<00:00:47.079> and<00:00:47.260> most<00:00:48.100> reports<00:00:48.550> say<00:00:48.700> that<00:00:48.730> this

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:48.970 
nature and most reports say that this

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:51.630 
nature and most reports say that this
will<00:00:49.180> be<00:00:49.210> a<00:00:49.329> grenade<00:00:49.860> friendly<00:00:50.860> map<00:00:51.130> and<00:00:51.399> a

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:51.640 
will be a grenade friendly map and a

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:53.370 
will be a grenade friendly map and a
very<00:00:51.880> close<00:00:52.149> quarters<00:00:52.720> friendly<00:00:53.079> map<00:00:53.200> so

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:53.380 
very close quarters friendly map so

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:54.690 
very close quarters friendly map so
those<00:00:53.530> with<00:00:53.680> shotguns<00:00:54.130> like<00:00:54.250> the<00:00:54.370> scattershot

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:56.890 
which can ricochet off surfaces will be

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:58.830

this<00:01:11.560> is<00:01:11.619> infinity<00:01:12.460> Slayer<00:01:12.700> which<00:01:12.880> basically

00:01:13.139 --> 00:01:13.149 
this is infinity Slayer which basically

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:15.209 
this is infinity Slayer which basically
means<00:01:13.420> when<00:01:13.840> you<00:01:14.319> get<00:01:14.469> enough<00:01:14.709> kills<00:01:15.009> and

that's<00:01:17.950> looking<00:01:18.369> above<00:01:18.789> the<00:01:18.999> armor<00:01:19.270> ability

00:01:19.559 --> 00:01:19.569 
that's looking above the armor ability

00:01:19.569 --> 00:01:21.059 
that's looking above the armor ability
will<00:01:19.719> fill<00:01:19.959> up<00:01:19.990> and<00:01:20.319> once<00:01:20.439> you<00:01:20.530> get<00:01:20.649> enough<00:01:20.859> get

00:01:22.559 --> 00:01:22.569 
to call in an ordinance dropping yet to

00:01:22.569 --> 00:01:24.330 
to call in an ordinance dropping yet to
pick<00:01:22.719> up<00:01:22.929> one<00:01:23.139> of<00:01:23.289> three<00:01:23.499> things<00:01:23.530> are<00:01:23.950> given<00:01:24.219> to

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:24.340 
pick up one of three things are given to

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:25.410 
pick up one of three things are given to
you<00:01:24.429> which<00:01:24.579> are<00:01:24.729> basically<00:01:24.850> randomly

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:25.420 
you which are basically randomly

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:27.269 
you which are basically randomly
selected<00:01:25.899> and<00:01:26.049> this<00:01:26.560> person<00:01:26.859> calls<00:01:27.100> in<00:01:27.189> an

00:01:27.269 --> 00:01:27.279 
selected and this person calls in an

00:01:27.279 --> 00:01:29.069 
selected and this person calls in an
over<00:01:27.579> she'll<00:01:27.819> but<00:01:27.999> when<00:01:28.389> they<00:01:28.539> call<00:01:28.779> it<00:01:28.899> there

00:01:29.069 --> 00:01:29.079 
over she'll but when they call it there

00:01:29.079 --> 00:01:31.019 
over she'll but when they call it there
underneath<00:01:29.560> one<00:01:30.009> of<00:01:30.039> these<00:01:30.249> levels<00:01:30.459> so<00:01:30.850> this

00:01:31.019 --> 00:01:31.029 
underneath one of these levels so this

00:01:31.029 --> 00:01:32.819 
underneath one of these levels so this
ordnance<00:01:31.450> drop<00:01:31.569> cannot<00:01:31.959> fall<00:01:32.289> in<00:01:32.469> from<00:01:32.709> the

00:01:32.819 --> 00:01:32.829 
ordnance drop cannot fall in from the

00:01:32.829 --> 00:01:34.529 
ordnance drop cannot fall in from the
sky<00:01:33.069> so<00:01:33.490> this<00:01:33.639> time<00:01:33.789> it<00:01:33.939> actually<00:01:34.090> just

00:01:34.529 --> 00:01:34.539 
sky so this time it actually just

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:36.120 
sky so this time it actually just
materializes<00:01:35.229> on<00:01:35.439> the<00:01:35.619> ground<00:01:35.859> so<00:01:35.979> that's

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:36.130 
materializes on the ground so that's

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:38.010 
materializes on the ground so that's

good to know is very interesting to see
we<00:01:38.139> also<00:01:38.349> get<00:01:38.799> to<00:01:38.829> see<00:01:39.219> this<00:01:39.700> player<00:01:39.999> colon<00:01:40.569> and

00:01:40.769 --> 00:01:40.779 
we also get to see this player colon and

00:01:40.779 --> 00:01:43.649

which<00:01:43.869> allows<00:01:44.200> space<00:01:44.560> free<00:01:44.770> essentially<00:01:45.369> for

which allows space free essentially for

00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:47.519

00:01:47.519 --> 00:01:47.529 
your boats they carry more damage so we

00:01:47.529 --> 00:01:49.499 
your boats they carry more damage so we
