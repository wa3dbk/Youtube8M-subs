is really important you actually put the

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:35.309 
is really important you actually put the
bread<00:03:33.639> in<00:03:33.910> the<00:03:33.970> bowl<00:03:34.299> and<00:03:34.630> spoon<00:03:34.900> the<00:03:35.079> soup

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:39.750 
over and because of the nature of the
sourdough<00:03:38.380> because<00:03:38.829> it's<00:03:39.069> slightly<00:03:39.340> stale

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:39.760 
sourdough because it's slightly stale

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:42.930 
sourdough because it's slightly stale
and<00:03:40.239> toasted<00:03:40.900> it<00:03:41.410> adds<00:03:41.650> a<00:03:41.769> huge<00:03:42.160> amount<00:03:42.639> to<00:03:42.730> the
