00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:58.380 
QPR and I can see that game having
plenty<00:01:56.500> of<00:01:56.740> goals<00:01:56.950> in<00:01:57.159> it<00:01:57.280> and<00:01:57.490> his<00:01:57.969> last<00:01:58.179> five

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:58.390 
plenty of goals in it and his last five

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:00.510 
plenty of goals in it and his last five
games<00:01:58.420> silver<00:01:59.229> has<00:01:59.439> only<00:01:59.679> had<00:01:59.920> two<00:02:00.100> shots<00:02:00.369> on

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:00.520 
games silver has only had two shots on

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.669 
games silver has only had two shots on
target<00:02:00.630> neither<00:02:01.630> of<00:02:01.810> which<00:02:01.899> resulted<00:02:02.470> in<00:02:02.590> a

00:02:02.669 --> 00:02:02.679 
target neither of which resulted in a

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:05.490 
target neither of which resulted in a
goal<00:02:02.890> however<00:02:03.700> he<00:02:03.939> has<00:02:03.970> attempted<00:02:04.630> 11<00:02:05.079> assists

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:05.500 
goal however he has attempted 11 assists

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.679 
goal however he has attempted 11 assists
in<00:02:05.590> that<00:02:05.740> time<00:02:06.009> two<00:02:06.610> of<00:02:06.759> those<00:02:06.939> resulting<00:02:07.509> in<00:02:07.630> a

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:07.689 
in that time two of those resulting in a

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:10.559 
in that time two of those resulting in a
goal<00:02:07.899> so<00:02:08.649> he's<00:02:08.830> not<00:02:08.979> in<00:02:09.130> his<00:02:09.220> finest<00:02:09.700> form<00:02:10.030> but

00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:10.569 
goal so he's not in his finest form but

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:12.479 
goal so he's not in his finest form but
he's<00:02:10.690> still<00:02:10.899> delivering<00:02:11.349> point<00:02:11.650> steadily<00:02:12.130> and

00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:12.489 
he's still delivering point steadily and

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:15.470 
he's still delivering point steadily and
I<00:02:12.730> can<00:02:12.910> see<00:02:13.060> him<00:02:13.180> scoring<00:02:13.510> high<00:02:13.720> this<00:02:13.780> weekend

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480

weekend he'll have a home game against
Burnley<00:02:48.280> I<00:02:48.459> can<00:02:49.060> see<00:02:49.239> it<00:02:49.359> being<00:02:49.480> a<00:02:49.600> tight<00:02:49.840> one

00:02:50.039 --> 00:02:50.049 
Burnley I can see it being a tight one

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:52.080 
Burnley I can see it being a tight one
with<00:02:50.620> Hall<00:02:50.829> possibly<00:02:51.340> just<00:02:51.519> clenching<00:02:51.819> a<00:02:51.910> win

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 
with Hall possibly just clenching a win

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:53.849 
with Hall possibly just clenching a win
and<00:02:52.329> I<00:02:52.660> think<00:02:52.870> this<00:02:52.930> man<00:02:53.139> will<00:02:53.290> be<00:02:53.350> the<00:02:53.440> one<00:02:53.620> to

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:53.859 
and I think this man will be the one to

00:02:53.859 --> 00:02:57.509 
and I think this man will be the one to
get<00:02:53.980> the<00:02:54.040> goal<00:02:54.310> and<00:02:55.769> finally<00:02:56.769> I'm<00:02:57.010> gonna

00:02:57.509 --> 00:02:57.519 
get the goal and finally I'm gonna

00:02:57.519 --> 00:02:58.949 
get the goal and finally I'm gonna
predict<00:02:57.819> that<00:02:57.970> cash<00:02:58.150> shelling<00:02:58.600> will<00:02:58.720> have<00:02:58.930> a

00:02:58.949 --> 00:02:58.959 
predict that cash shelling will have a

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:01.920 
predict that cash shelling will have a
good<00:02:59.139> week<00:02:59.790> personally<00:03:00.790> I'll<00:03:01.329> be<00:03:01.540> going<00:03:01.750> for

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
good week personally I'll be going for

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:03.420 
good week personally I'll be going for
three<00:03:02.139> attacking<00:03:02.590> players<00:03:02.859> from<00:03:03.010> Arsenal

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
three attacking players from Arsenal

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:05.370 
three attacking players from Arsenal
with<00:03:03.940> their<00:03:04.150> upcoming<00:03:04.540> double<00:03:04.870> gameweek<00:03:05.019> and

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:05.380 
with their upcoming double gameweek and

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:07.650 
with their upcoming double gameweek and
nice<00:03:05.620> run<00:03:05.859> of<00:03:05.980> fixtures<00:03:06.100> in<00:03:06.430> mind<00:03:06.850> but<00:03:07.510> they<00:03:07.600> do

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:07.660 
nice run of fixtures in mind but they do

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:10.080 
nice run of fixtures in mind but they do
have<00:03:08.019> a<00:03:08.049> decent<00:03:08.350> defensive<00:03:08.920> record<00:03:09.069> so<00:03:09.790> I<00:03:09.819> can

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
have a decent defensive record so I can

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:11.580 
have a decent defensive record so I can
see<00:03:10.269> the<00:03:10.389> appeal<00:03:10.420> of<00:03:10.660> picking<00:03:11.019> up<00:03:11.109> a<00:03:11.200> defender

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590 
see the appeal of picking up a defender

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:13.860 
see the appeal of picking up a defender
he<00:03:12.310> only<00:03:12.609> looks<00:03:12.910> the<00:03:13.060> least<00:03:13.239> likely<00:03:13.540> to<00:03:13.690> be

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:13.870 
he only looks the least likely to be

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:15.690 
he only looks the least likely to be
rotated<00:03:14.440> over<00:03:14.859> the<00:03:14.950> double<00:03:15.190> gameweek<00:03:15.370> in

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
rotated over the double gameweek in

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.330 
rotated over the double gameweek in
gaming<00:03:16.180> 37<00:03:16.870> and<00:03:17.049> I<00:03:17.620> think<00:03:17.950> it's<00:03:18.160> definitely

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340 
gaming 37 and I think it's definitely

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:20.430 
gaming 37 and I think it's definitely
worth<00:03:18.760> paying<00:03:19.060> the<00:03:19.299> six<00:03:19.540> million<00:03:19.840> for<00:03:20.049> him<00:03:20.230> for

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440 
worth paying the six million for him for

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.650 
worth paying the six million for him for
that<00:03:20.530> reason<00:03:20.739> cuz<00:03:21.639> she<00:03:21.760> only<00:03:21.910> has<00:03:22.120> managed<00:03:22.450> ten

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:22.660 
that reason cuz she only has managed ten

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:25.170 
that reason cuz she only has managed ten
clean<00:03:22.900> sheets<00:03:23.139> so<00:03:23.319> far<00:03:23.590> with<00:03:24.400> two<00:03:24.850> of<00:03:25.000> those

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:25.180 
clean sheets so far with two of those

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:27.690 
clean sheets so far with two of those
coming<00:03:25.510> in<00:03:25.720> the<00:03:25.810> last<00:03:26.049> three<00:03:26.290> games<00:03:26.319> and<00:03:26.829> also

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:27.700 
coming in the last three games and also

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:29.460 
coming in the last three games and also
has<00:03:27.910> three<00:03:28.090> goals<00:03:28.359> to<00:03:28.630> his<00:03:28.720> name<00:03:28.900> so<00:03:29.109> far<00:03:29.319> this

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.470 
has three goals to his name so far this

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:31.470 
has three goals to his name so far this
season<00:03:29.530> and<00:03:30.010> a<00:03:30.310> shots<00:03:30.579> per<00:03:30.790> game<00:03:30.819> average<00:03:31.120> of

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.480 
season and a shots per game average of

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.960 
season and a shots per game average of
9.3<00:03:31.930> so<00:03:32.590> he<00:03:32.709> does<00:03:32.889> pose<00:03:33.099> a<00:03:33.220> decent<00:03:33.579> attacking

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:33.970 
9.3 so he does pose a decent attacking

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:37.140 
9.3 so he does pose a decent attacking
threat<00:03:34.239> as<00:03:34.359> well<00:03:35.220> so<00:03:36.220> now<00:03:36.519> let's<00:03:36.760> take<00:03:36.849> a<00:03:36.910> look

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.150 
threat as well so now let's take a look

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:39.059 
threat as well so now let's take a look
