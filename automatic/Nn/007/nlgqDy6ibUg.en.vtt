00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:07.950
 God, tennis, I want to stop being a year. 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:11.090
 and become the hello launched team 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:14.940
 Let's go with me and that's it. 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:16.710
 O my career started I usually 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.930
 say that my career I started 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.939
 very early with 11 years old 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.680
 I actually did not start dribbling the 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.910
 Anxiety I but I always joked 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.310
 much with the voice 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.080
 Since childhood I 've always had a lot of 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.960
 ease of playing with the voice then 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.579
 family parties and limited people to 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.790
 being able to make clear money is always 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.200
 always have money in exchange but I 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.820
 I always have always made me 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.860
 jokes and I always had this 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.050
 So I usually say that 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.960
 my artistic life began with the 11 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.940
 10 11 year olds in the same dubbing myself 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:51.780
 I first started taking a 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:54.539
 theater for recreation I graduated later 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.590
 I already had a permanent job but it was not 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.149
 nothing to do with the area 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.180
 I then went to work with some 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:02.489
 pieces a few pieces of 34 pieces and then I 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.170
 I began to make advertising speech was 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.129
 for Senac I took a course in speaker 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.560
 advertising 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.970
 as soon as the course of speech ended 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.590
 another player who is no longer 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.630
 working in the area at the moment but the 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.369
 spencer totti's name is a great 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.890
 My friend, my friend, including a hug to 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.869
 he called me saying he looks already 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.830
 do not have a course in senac of initiation 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.330
 Dubbing 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.420
 I said it 's a thing that we 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.070
 I always wanted to at least understand how 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.619
 worked because it worked with the voice 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.420
 practically only voice and then we went to see 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.500
 we started the course in this course of mine 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.900
 teacher 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.490
 I had two that were gilberto rock that 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.040
 He is the man from São Paulo. 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.570
 practically null all plate plaques 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.070
 For those who do not know when you have one. 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.720
 movie a series 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.030
 in this movie you have something written 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.960
 so the hospital there comes that voice of the 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.540
 hospital 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.340
 that sort of thing, and there's the rosemary case. 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.780
 also that my godfather was my great 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.520
 Godfather, kiss for him. 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.579
 cassel the voice of rambo here in são paulo 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.350
 informs that it has done all it speaks well 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:00.119
 I hug him and he took me to 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.189
 to dub just that I did an internship of six 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.960
 months on the centaur who is a donor here 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:05.549
 in São Paulo after six months in the 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.799
 the first scale that as soon as the 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:09.479
 people call and then they started 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:11.819
 to make dots dots dots and 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.080
 then there eight years 78 years 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:15.120
 working now 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.980
 with dubbing and advertising phrases 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.910
 but much more with dubbing is 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.590
 that's right 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:21.570
 Wow, I think it 's a great 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.280
 burst same recognition was with 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:25.650
 There's no way there's no way to say. 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:28.200
 who was not with taking takes tips was a 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:30.510
 the gift that Marcelinho Campos gave 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.290
 me, great marcelo on the field a kiss to 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.380
 he too 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:36.180
 the guy that I learned a lot from him 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:38.280
 Marcelo called me and directed the 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.980
 knights movie take movie on 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.870
 cinema and then he gave me this 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:46.680
 character he the USA were 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:49.650
 protagonists of the knights or supper 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.930
 and practically they fought the 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:53.280
 time in the movie and it's very beautiful. 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:54.959
 Tomb story is cool, is not it? 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.730
 any as all riders have 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:58.709
 whole background story also has the 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:00.900
 his and in the end he realizes 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:02.340
 that Tony realizes that he's a bad guy 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:04.200
 he is simply seeking his 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:06.000
 ideals and did not know if it was right or 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.340
 with many times in our lives to 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.170
 people make some choices and not always 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.510
 that choice the best but then the 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:15.209
 people learn what is right 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:17.600
 Wow, I think it's not really a 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:21.300
 character because today in são paulo 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:23.670
 practically all the actors that come from 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:26.670
 hollywood they already have your voice 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:28.890
 sakineh characteristic but I think I 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:30.690
 I believe that being a protagonist 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:32.910
 taking away hints that he was the 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:35.130
 protagonist of the film of the prologue of 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:36.720
 sky its protagonist of a film for 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:39.000
 cinema is something I'm not 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:40.890
 Looking for my career, I've arrived. 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.110
 close I've done some great things but 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:45.180
 not a movie star 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:48.030
 then it'll probably be with an actor 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:50.250
 that one has one is so well voiced here in 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:51.590
 são paulo is still more on the river side and 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:53.670
 you do not have your voice here in são paulo 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:57.860
 so I think that soon more should 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:04:02.550
 appear in this last opportunity of 

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:04.620
 grace to live solid slab that she is and 

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:06.390
 it 's not just for the knights there are already 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:07.950
 four five years I'm not mistaken or 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:10.290
 is deceived but four years by the 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:12.570
 unless there is a law I do not know 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:14.370
 say what this law is but a law of 

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:16.799
 that does the following when 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:20.310
 every product that comes from outside it 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:22.410
 necessarily need a translation 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:24.680
 or subtitled or dubbed and all 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:26.290
 paid channels these days are 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:28.930
 offering 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:31.510
 movies and dubbing and this made a 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:34.030
 really good in our career and our 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:36.220
 Thank God it 's work over 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:38.020
 Work has had a week that is hoarse. 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:40.570
 how much you talk 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:42.820
 the business is the following is teacher of 

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:46.210
 knights I will start with take takes is 

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:47.710
 a great character in my life is a 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:50.320
 of the great characters so let's go 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:51.760
 try to look for some phrase similar to 

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:55.000
 the movie because I do not remember 

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:58.510
 exactly but the idea is this goddess 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:00.370
 Artemis because the knights can 

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:03.730
 live are gods 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:06.790
 I want to be a god artemis god by 

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:10.960
 Please, I want to stop being an angel and I 

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:13.420
 to make a god supper is more or less 

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:15.550
 so the tone is there and also has a 

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:18.010
 crazy that I do that calls Steve 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:20.800
 high five guy who has a kid in 

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:22.030
 home is ours is crazy because he is more 

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:24.700
 or less so 

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:26.410
 Hi, I'm here today, I'll show you 

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:28.570
 How do I do my room? 

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:30.370
 get all dressed up and be transformed 

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:35.080
 on a soccer field 

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:37.210
 Come on with me and it's hifi is very crazy 

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:39.760
 It's really cool to get him out of there. 

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:41.890
 Quiet, you know an energy. 

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:43.570
 there are also the power rangers who 

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:46.540
 I made the last samurai payment that 

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:47.050
 pass on nickelodeon to red you 

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:50.170
 speak 

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:53.790
 Sometimes we're going to be screwed. 

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:53.790
 with those bourgeois
