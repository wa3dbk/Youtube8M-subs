definitely think the pig would be even
more<00:02:13.260> honored<00:02:13.740> if<00:02:14.190> I<00:02:14.340> drink<00:02:14.610> a<00:02:14.730> little<00:02:14.820> bit

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
more honored if I drink a little bit

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.590 
more honored if I drink a little bit
more<00:02:15.060> beer
