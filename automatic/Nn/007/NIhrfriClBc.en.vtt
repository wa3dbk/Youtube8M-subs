00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:17.480 
hey guys so I'm back it's another night

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:21.140 
hey guys so I'm back it's another night
working<00:00:18.480> on<00:00:18.539> a<00:00:18.600> couple<00:00:18.990> of<00:00:19.020> things<00:00:19.289> here<00:00:20.150> so

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
working on a couple of things here so

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.290 
working on a couple of things here so
we've<00:00:22.080> got<00:00:22.260> the<00:00:22.410> parts<00:00:22.740> that<00:00:23.369> I<00:00:24.060> showed<00:00:24.240> you

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
we've got the parts that I showed you

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.990 
we've got the parts that I showed you
yesterday<00:00:24.449> that<00:00:24.779> have<00:00:25.460> have<00:00:26.460> cured<00:00:26.849> and

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
yesterday that have have cured and

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.089 
yesterday that have have cured and
everything<00:00:27.390> and<00:00:27.599> I've<00:00:28.590> sanded<00:00:28.769> them<00:00:29.039> down

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
everything and I've sanded them down

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:30.859 
everything and I've sanded them down
what<00:00:29.789> a<00:00:29.820> little<00:00:30.000> bit<00:00:30.119> that<00:00:30.269> need<00:00:30.420> to<00:00:30.539> be<00:00:30.599> done

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
what a little bit that need to be done

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.729 
what a little bit that need to be done
so<00:00:31.109> these<00:00:31.560> are<00:00:31.740> ready<00:00:31.890> to<00:00:32.070> be<00:00:32.189> installed<00:00:33.500> if<00:00:34.500> I

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
so these are ready to be installed if I

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.630 
so these are ready to be installed if I
wide<00:00:35.040> to<00:00:35.540> really<00:00:36.540> enforce<00:00:37.020> them<00:00:37.260> I<00:00:37.640> could

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
wide to really enforce them I could

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.130 
wide to really enforce them I could
drill<00:00:38.879> a<00:00:38.910> pinhole<00:00:39.329> through<00:00:39.570> here<00:00:39.809> and<00:00:39.960> put

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
drill a pinhole through here and put

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.990 
drill a pinhole through here and put
some<00:00:40.170> breast<00:00:40.500> rot<00:00:40.800> well<00:00:41.309> we're<00:00:41.460> not<00:00:41.700> going<00:00:41.879> to

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
some breast rot well we're not going to

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.970 
some breast rot well we're not going to
do<00:00:42.120> that<00:00:42.270> because<00:00:42.510> I<00:00:42.690> don't<00:00:42.870> think<00:00:43.050> that<00:00:43.200> means

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
do that because I don't think that means

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.580 
do that because I don't think that means
to<00:00:44.129> go<00:00:44.219> that<00:00:44.399> far<00:00:44.960> if<00:00:45.960> you're<00:00:46.110> wondering<00:00:46.469> what

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
to go that far if you're wondering what

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.319 
to go that far if you're wondering what
this<00:00:46.710> pile<00:00:47.010> of<00:00:47.039> stuff<00:00:47.430> here<00:00:47.730> is<00:00:48.440> it's<00:00:49.440> actually

00:00:50.319 --> 00:00:50.329 
this pile of stuff here is it's actually

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:53.810 
this pile of stuff here is it's actually
parts<00:00:51.329> of<00:00:51.539> the<00:00:51.719> LED<00:00:52.140> unit<00:00:52.379> for<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:52.739> head<00:00:52.890> I've

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
parts of the LED unit for the head I've

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:59.180 
parts of the LED unit for the head I've
taken<00:00:54.030> it<00:00:54.239> apart<00:00:55.940> this<00:00:56.940> is<00:00:57.920> it's<00:00:58.920> just<00:00:59.129> a

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
taken it apart this is it's just a

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.310 
taken it apart this is it's just a
really<00:00:59.430> simple<00:00:59.640> circuit<00:01:00.120> board<00:01:02.719> with<00:01:03.719> the<00:01:03.930> LED

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
really simple circuit board with the LED

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.510 
really simple circuit board with the LED
on<00:01:04.439> there<00:01:05.840> you<00:01:06.840> know<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.619> LED<00:01:07.770> is<00:01:08.130> not<00:01:08.310> very

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
on there you know the LED is not very

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.090 
on there you know the LED is not very
bright<00:01:08.760> and<00:01:09.060> as<00:01:09.780> I<00:01:10.080> stated<00:01:10.380> before<00:01:10.530> I'm

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
bright and as I stated before I'm

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.280 
bright and as I stated before I'm
changing<00:01:11.549> up<00:01:11.640> the<00:01:11.790> colors<00:01:12.150> I<00:01:12.360> don't<00:01:12.960> like<00:01:13.110> the

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
changing up the colors I don't like the

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.160 
changing up the colors I don't like the
yellow<00:01:13.820> LED<00:01:14.820> that's<00:01:15.180> in<00:01:15.330> here<00:01:15.540> so<00:01:16.020> I'm

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
yellow LED that's in here so I'm

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.280 
yellow LED that's in here so I'm
changing<00:01:16.619> it<00:01:16.770> out<00:01:16.890> now<00:01:17.840> after<00:01:18.840> running<00:01:19.110> the

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
changing it out now after running the

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.380 
changing it out now after running the
wall<00:01:19.470> greens<00:01:19.770> and<00:01:20.070> picking<00:01:20.460> up<00:01:20.580> a<00:01:20.759> couple<00:01:20.970> of

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
wall greens and picking up a couple of

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.450 
wall greens and picking up a couple of
batteries<00:01:22.229> I<00:01:22.500> could<00:01:23.130> have<00:01:23.220> gotten<00:01:23.369> them

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
batteries I could have gotten them

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.760 
batteries I could have gotten them
cheaper<00:01:23.790> forwarding<00:01:24.180> them<00:01:24.299> online<00:01:24.509> but<00:01:25.140> to

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
cheaper forwarding them online but to

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.100 
cheaper forwarding them online but to
I'm<00:01:25.920> patient<00:01:26.280> and<00:01:26.520> I<00:01:26.549> just<00:01:26.790> ended<00:01:27.090> up<00:01:27.150> running

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
I'm patient and I just ended up running

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:37.270 
I'm patient and I just ended up running
there<00:01:28.380> at<00:01:28.650> $4.99<00:01:29.460> a<00:01:29.490> pop<00:01:31.939> so<00:01:32.939> I<00:01:32.970> got<00:01:33.299> those<00:01:33.479> and

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:37.280 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.359 

switch<00:01:38.280> off<00:01:38.430> that<00:01:39.170> this<00:01:40.170> is<00:01:40.350> the<00:01:40.500> new<00:01:40.799> LED<00:01:41.009> that

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
switch off that this is the new LED that

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.520 
switch off that this is the new LED that
I'm<00:01:41.490> going<00:01:41.640> to<00:01:41.700> be<00:01:41.759> using<00:01:42.140> and<00:01:43.140> I<00:01:43.200> think<00:01:43.439> you

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
I'm going to be using and I think you

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:44.749 
I'm going to be using and I think you
may<00:01:43.649> have<00:01:43.680> seen<00:01:43.890> a<00:01:43.950> one<00:01:44.159> in<00:01:44.280> my<00:01:44.369> previous

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
may have seen a one in my previous

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:49.520 
may have seen a one in my previous
videos<00:01:45.119> I<00:01:45.390> picked<00:01:45.630> up<00:01:45.890> I<00:01:48.049> picked<00:01:49.049> up<00:01:49.229> a<00:01:49.320> couple

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
videos I picked up I picked up a couple

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.480 
videos I picked up I picked up a couple
of<00:01:49.710> these<00:01:49.890> LED<00:01:50.310> light<00:01:50.520> sets<00:01:50.790> they<00:01:51.299> were<00:01:51.360> I

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490 
of these LED light sets they were I

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:55.990 
of these LED light sets they were I
think<00:01:53.490> like<00:01:53.670> 550<00:01:54.299> or<00:01:54.390> something<00:01:54.630> like<00:01:54.689> that<00:01:54.780> on

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 
think like 550 or something like that on

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.649 
think like 550 or something like that on
Amazon<00:01:57.290> there's<00:01:58.290> 20<00:01:58.829> LEDs<00:01:59.280> on<00:01:59.520> each<00:01:59.759> one<00:02:00.030> now

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
Amazon there's 20 LEDs on each one now

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:03.819 
Amazon there's 20 LEDs on each one now
these<00:02:00.930> they<00:02:01.530> have<00:02:01.740> a<00:02:01.770> resistor<00:02:02.310> on<00:02:02.490> there<00:02:02.729> it's

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:03.829 
these they have a resistor on there it's

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:08.540 
these they have a resistor on there it's
you<00:02:04.829> know<00:02:04.950> run<00:02:05.219> by<00:02:05.460> three<00:02:06.090> double<00:02:06.509> a's<00:02:07.280> but<00:02:08.280> if

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
you know run by three double a's but if

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.350 
you know run by three double a's but if
you're<00:02:08.700> just<00:02:08.970> doing<00:02:09.349> one<00:02:10.349> or<00:02:10.379> two<00:02:11.090> like<00:02:12.090> this

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
you're just doing one or two like this

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.610 
you're just doing one or two like this
and<00:02:12.660> you're<00:02:12.780> just<00:02:12.810> doing<00:02:13.170> them<00:02:13.319> all

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
and you're just doing them all

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.140 
and you're just doing them all
like<00:02:13.890> the<00:02:14.040> watch<00:02:14.160> batteries<00:02:14.610> you<00:02:14.940> don't

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
like the watch batteries you don't

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:16.520 
like the watch batteries you don't
actually<00:02:15.360> have<00:02:15.540> to<00:02:15.690> have<00:02:15.810> a<00:02:15.930> resistor<00:02:16.440> in

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
actually have to have a resistor in

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.800 
actually have to have a resistor in
there<00:02:16.680> it's<00:02:16.920> not<00:02:17.190> gonna<00:02:17.370> burn<00:02:17.610> them<00:02:17.700> out<00:02:17.819> it's

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
there it's not gonna burn them out it's

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.360 
there it's not gonna burn them out it's
only<00:02:18.959> when<00:02:19.230> you<00:02:19.319> start<00:02:19.349> running<00:02:19.890> you<00:02:20.250> know

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
only when you start running you know

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.880 
only when you start running you know
multiple<00:02:20.610> batteries<00:02:21.030> things<00:02:21.540> like<00:02:21.720> that<00:02:21.900> so

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
multiple batteries things like that so

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.500 
multiple batteries things like that so
what<00:02:23.069> I'm<00:02:23.190> going<00:02:23.370> to<00:02:23.430> do<00:02:23.580> is<00:02:24.530> I<00:02:25.530> will<00:02:26.420> run<00:02:27.420> the

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
what I'm going to do is I will run the

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.420 
what I'm going to do is I will run the
wires<00:02:27.720> through<00:02:27.959> mount<00:02:28.349> that<00:02:28.800> on<00:02:29.010> the<00:02:29.160> front

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
wires through mount that on the front

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.380 
wires through mount that on the front
side<00:02:29.730> and<00:02:30.030> the<00:02:31.549> reason<00:02:32.549> I'm<00:02:32.670> going<00:02:32.700> with<00:02:33.150> the

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
side and the reason I'm going with the

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:38.170 
side and the reason I'm going with the
clear<00:02:33.660> light<00:02:33.930> is<00:02:34.670> because<00:02:35.670> I<00:02:36.030> want<00:02:36.420> to<00:02:36.540> be<00:02:37.019> able

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
clear light is because I want to be able

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:41.300 
clear light is because I want to be able
one<00:02:39.180> to<00:02:39.450> color<00:02:39.690> the<00:02:39.870> lenses<00:02:40.319> for<00:02:40.680> the<00:02:40.769> eyes<00:02:40.920> in

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
one to color the lenses for the eyes in

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:48.500 
one to color the lenses for the eyes in
red<00:02:41.700> and<00:02:42.110> then<00:02:43.160> for<00:02:44.160> the<00:02:47.030> for<00:02:48.030> the<00:02:48.120> sensor<00:02:48.390> on

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
red and then for the for the sensor on

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.420 
red and then for the for the sensor on
top<00:02:48.720> of<00:02:48.840> the<00:02:48.900> head<00:02:49.079> I'm<00:02:49.769> going<00:02:49.980> to<00:02:50.069> have<00:02:50.250> that

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
top of the head I'm going to have that

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:55.190 
top of the head I'm going to have that
green<00:02:50.730> and<00:02:51.049> I'm<00:02:52.049> thinking<00:02:52.560> about<00:02:54.200> piping

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
green and I'm thinking about piping

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.880 
green and I'm thinking about piping
color<00:02:55.470> along<00:02:56.010> and<00:02:56.420> doing<00:02:57.420> a<00:02:57.599> light<00:02:57.840> for<00:02:58.620> the

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
color along and doing a light for the

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:01.220 
color along and doing a light for the
sensor<00:02:59.190> in<00:02:59.280> the<00:02:59.400> back<00:02:59.640> of<00:02:59.849> the<00:02:59.910> head<00:03:00.090> I<00:03:00.599> don't

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
sensor in the back of the head I don't

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:02.960 
sensor in the back of the head I don't
know<00:03:01.379> I<00:03:01.650> have<00:03:01.799> to<00:03:01.920> look<00:03:02.040> at<00:03:02.160> the<00:03:02.250> parts<00:03:02.519> and<00:03:02.700> see

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
know I have to look at the parts and see

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.809 
know I have to look at the parts and see
if<00:03:03.660> it's<00:03:03.870> feasible<00:03:04.079> or<00:03:04.440> not<00:03:04.530> but<00:03:05.400> I<00:03:05.430> think<00:03:05.579> that

00:03:05.809 --> 00:03:05.819 
if it's feasible or not but I think that

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:07.970 
if it's feasible or not but I think that
would<00:03:05.910> be<00:03:05.940> pretty<00:03:06.329> cool<00:03:06.510> I'm<00:03:07.500> going<00:03:07.709> to<00:03:07.799> try

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
would be pretty cool I'm going to try

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.520 
would be pretty cool I'm going to try
and<00:03:08.099> use<00:03:08.280> several<00:03:08.610> of<00:03:08.849> these<00:03:09.090> different<00:03:09.900> LEDs

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
and use several of these different LEDs

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:16.039 
and use several of these different LEDs
throughout<00:03:11.900> the<00:03:12.900> body<00:03:13.110> like<00:03:14.690> the<00:03:15.690> Canon

00:03:16.039 --> 00:03:16.049 
throughout the body like the Canon

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:17.180 
throughout the body like the Canon
that's<00:03:16.260> in<00:03:16.379> the<00:03:16.470> chest

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
that's in the chest

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:18.650 
that's in the chest
maybe<00:03:17.489> the<00:03:17.670> vents<00:03:17.940> there<00:03:18.120> in<00:03:18.239> the<00:03:18.359> chest

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
maybe the vents there in the chest

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:20.840 
maybe the vents there in the chest
little<00:03:19.440> things<00:03:19.620> like<00:03:19.769> that<00:03:19.829> I<00:03:20.280> think<00:03:20.730> will

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:20.850 
little things like that I think will

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:25.039 
little things like that I think will
really<00:03:21.209> make<00:03:21.420> this<00:03:21.600> pop<00:03:23.600> another<00:03:24.600> thing<00:03:24.870> that

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:25.049 
really make this pop another thing that

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:27.020 
really make this pop another thing that
I'm<00:03:25.230> going<00:03:25.500> to<00:03:25.590> try<00:03:25.859> and<00:03:26.040> do<00:03:26.220> is<00:03:26.489> on<00:03:26.760> the

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
I'm going to try and do is on the

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:32.270 
I'm going to try and do is on the
Dragoon's<00:03:28.190> instead<00:03:29.190> of<00:03:29.340> using<00:03:29.700> and<00:03:31.160> turn<00:03:32.160> that

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
Dragoon's instead of using and turn that

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:36.379 
Dragoon's instead of using and turn that
back<00:03:32.489> on<00:03:32.750> instead<00:03:33.750> of<00:03:33.900> using<00:03:34.170> the<00:03:35.389> these

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:36.389 
back on instead of using the these

00:03:36.389 --> 00:03:39.500 
back on instead of using the these
stupid<00:03:36.900> stickers<00:03:37.639> because<00:03:38.639> they<00:03:38.940> don't<00:03:39.329> look

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
stupid stickers because they don't look

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:42.589 
stupid stickers because they don't look
very<00:03:39.569> good<00:03:39.810> I'm<00:03:40.739> thinking<00:03:41.250> about<00:03:41.489> using<00:03:42.030> these

00:03:42.589 --> 00:03:42.599 
very good I'm thinking about using these

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:45.589 
very good I'm thinking about using these
as<00:03:42.930> templates<00:03:43.440> and<00:03:43.620> I<00:03:44.310> have<00:03:44.549> some<00:03:44.790> really<00:03:45.239> fine

00:03:45.589 --> 00:03:45.599 
as templates and I have some really fine

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:49.099 
as templates and I have some really fine
brass<00:03:46.440> mesh<00:03:46.799> and<00:03:47.239> actually<00:03:48.239> cutting<00:03:48.540> that<00:03:48.870> out

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:49.109 
brass mesh and actually cutting that out

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:51.830 
brass mesh and actually cutting that out
and<00:03:49.380> using<00:03:49.859> that<00:03:50.069> instead<00:03:50.700> just<00:03:51.150> in<00:03:51.389> laying<00:03:51.630> it

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
and using that instead just in laying it

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.780 
and using that instead just in laying it
in<00:03:51.989> I'm<00:03:52.889> going<00:03:53.099> to<00:03:53.160> see<00:03:53.280> if<00:03:53.370> that's<00:03:53.519> feasible

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
in I'm going to see if that's feasible

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:56.270 
in I'm going to see if that's feasible
if<00:03:54.269> it<00:03:54.630> is<00:03:54.810> I'm<00:03:55.109> going<00:03:55.319> to<00:03:55.380> show<00:03:55.470> you<00:03:55.590> guys<00:03:55.829> how

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
if it is I'm going to show you guys how

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:00.319 
if it is I'm going to show you guys how

thoughts it does mean a lot to me this

00:04:13.579 --> 00:04:16.819 
thoughts it does mean a lot to me this
is<00:04:14.579> all<00:04:14.819> the<00:04:14.940> parts<00:04:15.180> for<00:04:15.269> the<00:04:15.389> head<00:04:15.569> so<00:04:16.440> that's

00:04:16.819 --> 00:04:16.829 
is all the parts for the head so that's

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:19.990 
is all the parts for the head so that's
kind<00:04:17.700> of<00:04:17.760> what<00:04:17.910> I'm<00:04:18.030> working<00:04:18.299> on<00:04:18.419> right<00:04:19.049> now

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:20.000

00:04:29.379 --> 00:04:29.389 

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:32.420 

and<00:04:30.389> this<00:04:30.599> has<00:04:30.720> been<00:04:30.900> sanded<00:04:31.319> down<00:04:31.430> polished

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:39.360 
ready for priming you know the details

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:46.059 
ready for priming you know the details
on<00:04:39.539> the<00:04:39.659> inside<00:04:39.810> are<00:04:40.169> actually<00:04:41.159> really<00:04:41.789> great

00:04:46.059 --> 00:04:46.069
