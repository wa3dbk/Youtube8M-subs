23<00:00:14.490> millimeter<00:00:15.000> lens<00:00:15.299> that<00:00:15.599> I<00:00:15.719> actually<00:00:16.289> used

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
23 millimeter lens that I actually used

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.120 
23 millimeter lens that I actually used
when<00:00:17.670> testing<00:00:18.029> this<00:00:18.090> camera<00:00:18.420> quite<00:00:18.570> a<00:00:18.600> bit<00:00:18.840> and

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:19.130 
when testing this camera quite a bit and

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:23.150 
when testing this camera quite a bit and
there's<00:00:20.130> a<00:00:20.220> 18<00:00:21.150> to<00:00:21.270> 55<00:00:21.660> millimeter<00:00:22.350> kit<00:00:22.949> lens

there's a 18 to 55 millimeter kit lens

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.250 
there's a 18 to 55 millimeter kit lens
shown<00:00:23.630> on<00:00:24.630> the<00:00:24.779> xt-1

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
shown on the xt-1

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.099 
shown on the xt-1
so<00:00:26.250> with<00:00:26.580> that<00:00:26.760> let's<00:00:27.449> take<00:00:27.599> a<00:00:27.630> quick<00:00:27.810> look<00:00:27.960> at

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
so with that let's take a quick look at

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.800 
so with that let's take a quick look at
it<00:00:28.580> so<00:00:29.580> first<00:00:29.820> of<00:00:30.000> all<00:00:30.090> you<00:00:30.240> notice<00:00:30.420> there's

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
it so first of all you notice there's

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.520 
it so first of all you notice there's
this<00:00:31.340> flash<00:00:32.340> that<00:00:33.030> is<00:00:33.450> included<00:00:34.170> in<00:00:34.230> the<00:00:34.320> kit

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
this flash that is included in the kit

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.350 
this flash that is included in the kit
goes<00:00:34.890> on<00:00:35.100> the<00:00:35.190> hot<00:00:35.370> shoe<00:00:35.399> there's<00:00:35.880> a<00:00:35.940> hot<00:00:36.120> shoe

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
goes on the hot shoe there's a hot shoe

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.049 
goes on the hot shoe there's a hot shoe
here<00:00:36.600> that<00:00:36.809> could<00:00:37.140> take<00:00:37.350> the<00:00:37.500> same<00:00:37.710> flash<00:00:38.059> and

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
here that could take the same flash and

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.680 
here that could take the same flash and
I'll<00:00:39.390> remove<00:00:39.719> this<00:00:39.989> by<00:00:40.829> simply<00:00:41.420> pushing<00:00:42.420> this

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
I'll remove this by simply pushing this

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.670 
I'll remove this by simply pushing this
button<00:00:42.930> and<00:00:43.379> sliding<00:00:43.680> it<00:00:43.890> off<00:00:45.440> well<00:00:46.440> this

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
button and sliding it off well this

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.700 
button and sliding it off well this
features<00:00:47.129> its<00:00:47.640> own<00:00:47.879> little<00:00:48.500> pop-up<00:00:49.500> flash

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
features its own little pop-up flash

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.069 
features its own little pop-up flash
here<00:00:50.250> turn<00:00:50.760> that<00:00:50.879> on<00:00:52.190> this<00:00:53.190> isn't<00:00:53.550> very<00:00:53.670> good

00:00:54.069 --> 00:00:54.079 
here turn that on this isn't very good

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:58.310 
here turn that on this isn't very good
and<00:00:55.079> so<00:00:56.010> I've<00:00:56.460> actually<00:00:56.780> found<00:00:57.780> this<00:00:58.020> to<00:00:58.199> be

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
and so I've actually found this to be

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.200 
and so I've actually found this to be
quite<00:00:58.559> good<00:00:58.710> and<00:00:58.980> I'm<00:00:59.489> very<00:00:59.520> satisfied<00:00:59.879> with

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
quite good and I'm very satisfied with

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.750 
quite good and I'm very satisfied with
it<00:01:00.510> in<00:01:00.600> fact<00:01:00.859> it<00:01:01.859> kind<00:01:02.100> of<00:01:02.250> like<00:01:02.340> one<00:01:02.489> for<00:01:02.640> my

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
it in fact it kind of like one for my

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.350 
it in fact it kind of like one for my
own<00:01:02.789> camera<00:01:03.090> here<00:01:03.390> and<00:01:03.949> so<00:01:04.949> next<00:01:05.640> up<00:01:05.880> one<00:01:06.270> of

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
own camera here and so next up one of

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.969 
own camera here and so next up one of
the<00:01:06.479> big<00:01:06.630> differences<00:01:07.110> that<00:01:07.260> we<00:01:07.409> see<00:01:07.439> about

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
the big differences that we see about

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.870 
the big differences that we see about
this<00:01:08.220> camera<00:01:08.490> is<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.479> addition<00:01:09.810> of<00:01:09.869> these

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:10.880 
this camera is the addition of these

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.810 
this camera is the addition of these
knobs<00:01:11.880> and<00:01:12.390> they're<00:01:12.840> multi-layered<00:01:13.409> knobs<00:01:13.820> so

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
knobs and they're multi-layered knobs so

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.210 
knobs and they're multi-layered knobs so
if<00:01:15.000> you<00:01:15.090> look<00:01:15.299> carefully<00:01:15.570> here<00:01:16.080> you'll<00:01:16.979> see

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
if you look carefully here you'll see

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.170 
if you look carefully here you'll see
that<00:01:17.490> up<00:01:17.909> top<00:01:18.360> I<00:01:18.659> can<00:01:19.140> change<00:01:19.320> my<00:01:19.439> ISO<00:01:20.009> or<00:01:21.000> go<00:01:21.119> to

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
that up top I can change my ISO or go to

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.140 
that up top I can change my ISO or go to
auto<00:01:21.390> ISO<00:01:21.869> and<00:01:22.220> there's<00:01:23.220> a<00:01:23.280> little<00:01:23.580> selector

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
auto ISO and there's a little selector

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.310 
auto ISO and there's a little selector
here<00:01:24.479> that<00:01:25.110> allows<00:01:25.320> me<00:01:25.619> to<00:01:26.150> switch<00:01:27.150> to<00:01:27.540> burst

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
here that allows me to switch to burst

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.780 
here that allows me to switch to burst
mode<00:01:28.619> bracket<00:01:29.189> mode<00:01:29.540> single<00:01:30.540> shot<00:01:30.810> at<00:01:31.790> multi

so<00:01:37.650> I<00:01:38.009> really<00:01:38.909> like<00:01:39.060> having<00:01:39.360> that<00:01:39.450> on<00:01:39.570> here

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
so I really like having that on here

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.219 
so I really like having that on here

I had no problems with it and I actually
enjoy<00:02:41.260> it<00:02:41.290> being<00:02:41.650> there<00:02:41.890> but<00:02:42.790> I<00:02:42.849> did<00:02:43.030> want<00:02:43.209> to

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:43.239

I'm<00:02:48.220> turning<00:02:48.670> this<00:02:48.790> off<00:02:50.489> that<00:02:53.069> what's<00:02:54.069> changed

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:54.580 
I'm turning this off that what's changed

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:57.590 
I'm turning this off that what's changed
here<00:02:54.910> is<00:02:55.060> that<00:02:55.269> you<00:02:55.390> now<00:02:55.600> have<00:02:55.799> articulating

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:57.600 
here is that you now have articulating

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.449 
here is that you now have articulating
but<00:02:58.600> unfortunately<00:02:59.380> display<00:03:00.280> but

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:00.459 
but unfortunately display but

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:02.039 
but unfortunately display but
unfortunately<00:03:01.120> doesn't<00:03:01.390> allow<00:03:01.480> you<00:03:01.540> to<00:03:01.660> view

00:03:02.039 --> 00:03:02.049 
unfortunately doesn't allow you to view

unfortunately doesn't allow you to view
the<00:03:02.110> front<00:03:02.470> but<00:03:02.590> it<00:03:02.680> is<00:03:02.739> handy<00:03:03.160> when<00:03:03.190> you<00:03:03.400> want

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
the front but it is handy when you want

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:07.140 
the front but it is handy when you want
to<00:03:03.670> do<00:03:04.299> like<00:03:04.450> macros<00:03:04.900> or<00:03:04.930> you're<00:03:05.470> up<00:03:05.739> high<00:03:06.150> when

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
to do like macros or you're up high when

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:08.960 
to do like macros or you're up high when
it<00:03:07.239> can<00:03:07.360> I<00:03:07.390> could<00:03:07.600> do<00:03:07.690> it<00:03:07.810> over<00:03:07.900> the<00:03:08.170> crowd<00:03:08.380> shot

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
it can I could do it over the crowd shot

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.250 
it can I could do it over the crowd shot
so<00:03:09.970> it's<00:03:10.060> not<00:03:10.150> completely<00:03:10.540> useless<00:03:10.780> but<00:03:11.200> I

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
so it's not completely useless but I

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:12.990 
so it's not completely useless but I
really<00:03:11.440> wish<00:03:11.590> it<00:03:11.769> would<00:03:11.950> flip<00:03:12.220> out<00:03:12.370> or<00:03:12.700> flip<00:03:12.880> up

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
really wish it would flip out or flip up

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.400 
really wish it would flip out or flip up
to<00:03:13.120> the<00:03:13.269> side<00:03:15.600> where<00:03:16.600> things<00:03:16.840> differ<00:03:17.079> on<00:03:17.320> the

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:17.410 
to the side where things differ on the

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:19.289 
to the side where things differ on the
back<00:03:17.620> this<00:03:18.370> things<00:03:18.670> have<00:03:18.850> been<00:03:18.940> moved<00:03:19.180> around

00:03:19.289 --> 00:03:19.299 
back this things have been moved around

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:22.680 
back this things have been moved around
or<00:03:19.810> replaced<00:03:20.170> with<00:03:20.350> knobs<00:03:21.150> but<00:03:22.150> probably<00:03:22.540> the

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
or replaced with knobs but probably the

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:24.180 
or replaced with knobs but probably the
biggest<00:03:22.840> difference<00:03:23.170> is<00:03:23.620> that<00:03:23.769> this<00:03:23.950> has<00:03:24.160> a

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:24.190 
biggest difference is that this has a

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:27.660 
biggest difference is that this has a
huge<00:03:25.170> electronic<00:03:26.170> viewfinder<00:03:26.859> that<00:03:27.040> really

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:27.670 
huge electronic viewfinder that really

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:30.599 
huge electronic viewfinder that really
is<00:03:27.790> far<00:03:28.390> superior<00:03:28.540> to<00:03:28.930> the<00:03:29.109> one<00:03:29.650> cut<00:03:29.859> on<00:03:29.980> xe2

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:30.609 
is far superior to the one cut on xe2

00:03:30.609 --> 00:03:34.440 
is far superior to the one cut on xe2
and<00:03:31.049> more<00:03:32.049> importantly<00:03:32.530> they've<00:03:32.829> put<00:03:33.130> on<00:03:33.450> a

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:34.450 
and more importantly they've put on a

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:39.000 
and more importantly they've put on a
really<00:03:35.440> nice<00:03:36.000> thick<00:03:37.260> grip<00:03:38.260> both<00:03:38.470> on<00:03:38.680> the<00:03:38.799> back

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.010 
really nice thick grip both on the back

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:41.990 
really nice thick grip both on the back
and<00:03:39.340> on<00:03:39.430> the<00:03:39.489> front<00:03:39.850> if<00:03:40.630> you<00:03:40.690> look<00:03:41.109> at<00:03:41.230> these

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
and on the front if you look at these

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.120 
and on the front if you look at these
you<00:03:43.000> know<00:03:43.170> from<00:03:44.170> the<00:03:44.290> depth<00:03:44.530> standpoint

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:45.130 
you know from the depth standpoint

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:47.729 
you know from the depth standpoint
you'll<00:03:45.400> see<00:03:45.640> that<00:03:46.079> there's<00:03:47.079> definitely<00:03:47.350> a<00:03:47.620> lot

00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:47.739 
you'll see that there's definitely a lot

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:49.680 
you'll see that there's definitely a lot
more<00:03:47.769> chunk<00:03:48.280> to<00:03:48.459> hang<00:03:48.609> on<00:03:48.790> to<00:03:48.940> here<00:03:49.180> so<00:03:49.359> I<00:03:49.390> found

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:49.690 
more chunk to hang on to here so I found

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:52.440 
more chunk to hang on to here so I found
that<00:03:49.870> in<00:03:50.049> holding<00:03:50.950> this<00:03:51.160> it<00:03:51.790> felt<00:03:52.060> more<00:03:52.269> like<00:03:52.329> a

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:52.450 
that in holding this it felt more like a

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:55.559 
that in holding this it felt more like a
DSLR<00:03:53.069> easy<00:03:54.069> to<00:03:54.280> grip<00:03:54.459> I<00:03:54.670> can<00:03:54.700> dangle<00:03:55.030> this<00:03:55.299> my

00:03:55.559 --> 00:03:55.569 
DSLR easy to grip I can dangle this my

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:59.220 
DSLR easy to grip I can dangle this my
fingers<00:03:56.040> there's<00:03:57.040> no<00:03:57.190> way<00:03:57.900> I'm<00:03:58.900> going<00:03:59.079> to<00:03:59.109> do

there's nothing going to happen now if I

there's nothing going to happen now if I

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:52.030 
go all the way out to the outer edge and

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:55.969 
go all the way out to the outer edge and
press<00:04:52.840> it<00:04:53.080> then<00:04:53.470> I'll<00:04:53.830> depress<00:04:54.340> it<00:04:54.550> but<00:04:54.789> listen

00:04:55.969 --> 00:04:55.979 
press it then I'll depress it but listen

00:04:55.979 --> 00:04:59.189 
press it then I'll depress it but listen
there's<00:04:56.979> like<00:04:57.160> almost<00:04:57.520> no<00:04:58.060> audible<00:04:58.330> sound<00:04:58.840> so

00:04:59.189 --> 00:04:59.199 
there's like almost no audible sound so

00:04:59.199 --> 00:05:00.450 
there's like almost no audible sound so
you<00:04:59.260> really<00:04:59.650> can't<00:04:59.860> hear<00:05:00.070> it<00:05:00.190> when<00:05:00.310> you're

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:00.460 
you really can't hear it when you're

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:02.250 
you really can't hear it when you're
working<00:05:00.789> with<00:05:00.940> this<00:05:01.060> camera<00:05:01.270> more

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:02.260 
working with this camera more

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.920 
working with this camera more
importantly<00:05:02.740> this<00:05:02.949> lack<00:05:03.220> of<00:05:03.720> beveled<00:05:04.720> edge

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:04.930 
importantly this lack of beveled edge

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:07.650 
importantly this lack of beveled edge
means<00:05:05.889> that<00:05:06.280> a<00:05:06.550> lot<00:05:06.820> of<00:05:06.910> times<00:05:07.150> you<00:05:07.479> know<00:05:07.600> you

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:07.660 
means that a lot of times you know you

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:09.870 
means that a lot of times you know you
hit<00:05:08.020> and<00:05:08.169> you<00:05:08.229> miss<00:05:08.530> and<00:05:08.860> then<00:05:09.430> you<00:05:09.639> start

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:09.880 
hit and you miss and then you start

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:11.279 
hit and you miss and then you start
hunting<00:05:10.270> around<00:05:10.389> because<00:05:10.870> you<00:05:10.960> think<00:05:11.139> you're

00:05:11.279 --> 00:05:11.289 
hunting around because you think you're

00:05:11.289 --> 00:05:12.719 
hunting around because you think you're
in<00:05:11.380> the<00:05:11.440> wrong<00:05:11.590> spot<00:05:11.919> and<00:05:12.250> you<00:05:12.370> end<00:05:12.490> up<00:05:12.520> hitting

00:05:12.719 --> 00:05:12.729 
in the wrong spot and you end up hitting

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:15.870 
in the wrong spot and you end up hitting
the<00:05:13.000> wrong<00:05:13.180> button<00:05:13.240> and<00:05:13.810> so<00:05:14.650> I<00:05:14.949> found<00:05:15.550> this<00:05:15.729> to

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:15.880 
the wrong button and so I found this to

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:19.080 
the wrong button and so I found this to
be<00:05:15.910> extremely<00:05:16.780> frustrating<00:05:17.610> and<00:05:18.610> it<00:05:18.880> really

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:19.090 
be extremely frustrating and it really

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:22.260 
be extremely frustrating and it really
made<00:05:19.539> the<00:05:19.720> camera<00:05:20.250> very<00:05:21.250> painful<00:05:21.820> to<00:05:21.880> operate

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:22.270 
made the camera very painful to operate

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:25.680 
made the camera very painful to operate
under<00:05:23.190> normal<00:05:24.190> circumstances<00:05:24.910> I<00:05:25.030> really<00:05:25.240> just

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:25.690 
under normal circumstances I really just

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:28.350 
under normal circumstances I really just
I<00:05:25.870> can't<00:05:26.380> stress<00:05:27.160> enough<00:05:27.370> how<00:05:27.580> bad<00:05:28.090> this

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:28.360 
I can't stress enough how bad this

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:31.409 
I can't stress enough how bad this
design<00:05:28.780> is<00:05:29.020> so<00:05:29.740> I'm<00:05:30.099> I'm<00:05:30.310> hoping<00:05:31.150> and<00:05:31.300> praying

00:05:31.409 --> 00:05:31.419 
design is so I'm I'm hoping and praying

00:05:31.419 --> 00:05:34.500 
design is so I'm I'm hoping and praying
that<00:05:31.949> Fujifilm<00:05:32.949> will<00:05:33.160> return<00:05:33.490> this<00:05:33.760> excellent

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:34.510 
that Fujifilm will return this excellent

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:36.810 
that Fujifilm will return this excellent
design<00:05:34.780> they<00:05:35.020> had<00:05:35.169> before<00:05:35.530> it<00:05:36.280> wasn't<00:05:36.639> broken

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:36.820 
design they had before it wasn't broken

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:38.969 
design they had before it wasn't broken
I<00:05:37.060> don't<00:05:37.270> see<00:05:37.419> why<00:05:37.599> they<00:05:37.780> found<00:05:38.199> a<00:05:38.289> need<00:05:38.500> to<00:05:38.770> fix

00:05:38.969 --> 00:05:38.979 
I don't see why they found a need to fix

00:05:38.979 --> 00:05:40.620 
I don't see why they found a need to fix
it<00:05:39.220> and<00:05:39.430> they<00:05:39.639> certainly<00:05:39.849> didn't<00:05:40.270> fix<00:05:40.449> that

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:40.630 
it and they certainly didn't fix that

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:44.189 
it and they certainly didn't fix that
they<00:05:40.750> broke<00:05:41.320> it<00:05:41.500> significantly<00:05:42.449> now<00:05:43.449> looking

00:05:44.189 --> 00:05:44.199 
they broke it significantly now looking

00:05:44.199 --> 00:05:49.110 
they broke it significantly now looking
at<00:05:44.320> front<00:05:46.590> things<00:05:47.590> are<00:05:47.830> are<00:05:48.120> fundamentally

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:49.120 
at front things are are fundamentally

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:51.689 
at front things are are fundamentally
the<00:05:49.150> same<00:05:49.650> but<00:05:50.650> what<00:05:50.919> they've<00:05:51.099> done<00:05:51.130> is

00:05:51.689 --> 00:05:51.699 
the same but what they've done is

00:05:51.699 --> 00:05:54.060 
the same but what they've done is
they've<00:05:52.510> also<00:05:52.690> added<00:05:52.990> a<00:05:53.260> new<00:05:53.409> function<00:05:53.830> button

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:54.070 
they've also added a new function button

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:55.170 
they've also added a new function button
up<00:05:54.190> here<00:05:54.340> which<00:05:54.520> I<00:05:54.639> like<00:05:54.849> a<00:05:54.880> lot<00:05:55.150> because

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:55.180 
up here which I like a lot because

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:58.020 
up here which I like a lot because
personally<00:05:56.050> I<00:05:56.110> set<00:05:56.349> that<00:05:56.560> to<00:05:56.680> be<00:05:56.800> my<00:05:57.030> timer

00:05:58.020 --> 00:05:58.030 
personally I set that to be my timer

00:05:58.030 --> 00:05:59.370 
personally I set that to be my timer
button<00:05:58.360> but<00:05:58.570> it<00:05:58.659> could<00:05:58.780> be<00:05:58.870> your<00:05:59.020> depth<00:05:59.229> of

00:05:59.370 --> 00:05:59.380 
button but it could be your depth of

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:00.960 
button but it could be your depth of
field<00:05:59.440> preview<00:05:59.889> or<00:06:00.250> whatever<00:06:00.490> you<00:06:00.610> want<00:06:00.789> it<00:06:00.849> to

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:00.970 
field preview or whatever you want it to

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:03.480 
field preview or whatever you want it to
be<00:06:01.199> but<00:06:02.199> having<00:06:02.440> another<00:06:02.620> programmable

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:07.030 
function button is always great you know

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:08.550 
function button is always great you know
aside<00:06:07.389> from<00:06:07.449> that<00:06:07.690> they're<00:06:08.020> both<00:06:08.169> using<00:06:08.500> the

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:08.560 
aside from that they're both using the

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:11.219 
aside from that they're both using the
same<00:06:08.770> batteries<00:06:09.389> they're<00:06:10.389> fundamentally<00:06:11.020> the

00:06:11.219 --> 00:06:11.229 
same batteries they're fundamentally the

00:06:11.229 --> 00:06:15.649 
same batteries they're fundamentally the
same<00:06:11.260> and<00:06:12.510> and<00:06:13.620> you<00:06:14.620> know<00:06:14.710> certainly<00:06:15.099> the

00:06:15.649 --> 00:06:15.659 
same and and you know certainly the

00:06:15.659 --> 00:06:18.800 
same and and you know certainly the
performance<00:06:16.659> has<00:06:17.440> improved<00:06:17.590> but<00:06:18.130> the<00:06:18.190> battery

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:18.810 
performance has improved but the battery

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:20.460 
performance has improved but the battery
battery<00:06:19.810> life<00:06:19.930> doesn't<00:06:20.260> seem<00:06:20.349> to<00:06:20.409> be

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:20.470 
battery life doesn't seem to be

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:22.800 
battery life doesn't seem to be
significantly<00:06:21.070> impacted<00:06:21.580> they<00:06:22.360> both<00:06:22.570> use<00:06:22.780> the

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:22.810 
significantly impacted they both use the

significantly impacted they both use the
same<00:06:23.139> exact<00:06:23.470> battery<00:06:24.000> but<00:06:25.000> I<00:06:25.300> found<00:06:25.599> that<00:06:25.810> I

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:26.470 
same exact battery but I found that I

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:28.350 
same exact battery but I found that I
definitely<00:06:26.949> got<00:06:27.310> a<00:06:27.340> lot<00:06:27.490> better<00:06:27.639> performance

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:28.360 
definitely got a lot better performance

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:30.899 
definitely got a lot better performance
in<00:06:28.570> terms<00:06:28.720> of<00:06:29.020> responsiveness<00:06:29.979> burst<00:06:30.550> mode

00:06:30.899 --> 00:06:30.909 
in terms of responsiveness burst mode

00:06:30.909 --> 00:06:33.500 
in terms of responsiveness burst mode
everything<00:06:31.330> out<00:06:32.139> of<00:06:32.199> the<00:06:32.620> xt-1

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:33.510 
everything out of the xt-1

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:36.779
