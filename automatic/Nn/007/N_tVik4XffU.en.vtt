00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
running of course full windows 8.1 why

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.930 
running of course full windows 8.1 why
do<00:00:39.180> you<00:00:39.420> want<00:00:39.629> to<00:00:39.690> run<00:00:39.840> Windows<00:00:40.410> RT<00:00:40.620> on<00:00:41.010> a<00:00:41.040> Koi

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
do you want to run Windows RT on a Koi

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.060 
do you want to run Windows RT on a Koi
that<00:00:42.660> makes<00:00:42.840> no<00:00:42.989> sense

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
that makes no sense

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.910 
that makes no sense
anyways<00:00:44.670> I<00:00:45.149> would<00:00:46.079> guess<00:00:46.289> that<00:00:46.320> this<00:00:46.680> has

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
anyways I would guess that this has

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.880 
anyways I would guess that this has
roughly<00:00:47.370> around<00:00:47.520> like<00:00:48.020> 4<00:00:49.020> gigabytes<00:00:49.469> of<00:00:49.649> RAM

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
roughly around like 4 gigabytes of RAM

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.139 
roughly around like 4 gigabytes of RAM
there<00:00:50.070> should<00:00:50.219> be<00:00:50.309> different<00:00:50.670> version<00:00:50.969> check

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
there should be different version check

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.100 
there should be different version check
it<00:00:51.300> out<00:00:51.480> properties<00:00:52.469> here<00:00:52.980> we<00:00:53.039> go<00:00:53.899> so<00:00:54.899> this

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
it out properties here we go so this

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.110 
it out properties here we go so this
comes<00:00:55.649> with<00:00:55.829> 2<00:00:56.070> gigabytes<00:00:56.280> of<00:00:56.610> RAM<00:00:56.850> but<00:00:57.000> it

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
comes with 2 gigabytes of RAM but it

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.790 
comes with 2 gigabytes of RAM but it
should<00:00:57.270> also<00:00:57.510> be<00:00:57.660> version<00:00:57.989> available<00:00:58.079> was

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
should also be version available was

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.520 
should also be version available was
foggy<00:00:59.100> good<00:00:59.309> bytes<00:00:59.460> of<00:00:59.609> RAM<00:00:59.879> and<00:01:00.199> it<00:01:01.199> has<00:01:01.379> an

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
foggy good bytes of RAM and it has an

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.429 
foggy good bytes of RAM and it has an
hard<00:01:01.949> disk<00:01:02.280> off<00:01:02.660> let<00:01:03.660> me<00:01:03.690> just<00:01:03.840> quickly<00:01:04.260> check

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
hard disk off let me just quickly check

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:09.469 
hard disk off let me just quickly check
this<00:01:05.600> actually<00:01:06.600> an<00:01:06.780> SSD<00:01:07.260> in<00:01:07.650> here<00:01:08.189> of<00:01:08.479> 64

sides so this was very very decent I'm
not<00:02:36.060> so<00:02:36.240> sure<00:02:36.270> about<00:02:36.480> this<00:02:36.870> track<00:02:37.170> of<00:02:37.320> this

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
not so sure about this track of this

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.800 
not so sure about this track of this
kind<00:02:37.800> of<00:02:37.890> feels<00:02:38.130> a<00:02:38.250> little<00:02:38.430> bit<00:02:38.580> small<00:02:38.810> and

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
kind of feels a little bit small and

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.310 
kind of feels a little bit small and
also<00:02:40.050> it's<00:02:40.320> not<00:02:40.490> a<00:02:41.490> multi-touch<00:02:42.480> one<00:02:42.780> but<00:02:43.140> it

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:43.320 
also it's not a multi-touch one but it

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.250 
also it's not a multi-touch one but it
feels<00:02:43.590> very<00:02:44.210> responsive<00:02:45.210> so<00:02:45.630> this<00:02:45.870> would<00:02:46.080> be

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
feels very responsive so this would be

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.020 
feels very responsive so this would be
