urban camo back there's a gray version
like<00:00:26.500> this<00:00:26.800> and<00:00:27.699> there<00:00:27.849> are<00:00:27.939> various<00:00:28.330> though

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:28.480 
like this and there are various though

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:29.909 
like this and there are various though
the<00:00:28.539> designs<00:00:28.929> I<00:00:29.080> think<00:00:29.289> there<00:00:29.410> are<00:00:29.439> about<00:00:29.619> five

00:00:29.909 --> 00:00:29.919 
the designs I think there are about five

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:31.620 
the designs I think there are about five
of<00:00:30.099> them<00:00:30.250> in<00:00:30.279> total<00:00:30.609> but<00:00:31.119> I<00:00:31.179> wanted<00:00:31.359> to<00:00:31.419> show

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:31.630 
of them in total but I wanted to show

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:33.330 
of them in total but I wanted to show
you<00:00:31.660> why<00:00:31.960> it's<00:00:32.230> become<00:00:32.529> one<00:00:32.680> of<00:00:32.710> my<00:00:32.800> favorites

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:33.340 
you why it's become one of my favorites

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:35.400 
you why it's become one of my favorites
is<00:00:33.460> because<00:00:33.880> it's<00:00:34.060> actually<00:00:34.270> one<00:00:35.050> of<00:00:35.079> the<00:00:35.230> most

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:35.410 
is because it's actually one of the most

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:38.040 
is because it's actually one of the most
versatile<00:00:36.070> folio<00:00:36.760> style<00:00:37.180> cases<00:00:37.690> that<00:00:37.900> I've

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:38.050 
versatile folio style cases that I've

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:41.880 
versatile folio style cases that I've
ever<00:00:38.080> come<00:00:38.530> across<00:00:38.560> and<00:00:40.410> from<00:00:41.410> looking<00:00:41.710> on<00:00:41.800> it

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:41.890 
ever come across and from looking on it

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:43.830 
ever come across and from looking on it
on<00:00:42.010> face<00:00:42.220> value<00:00:42.370> you<00:00:42.910> wouldn't<00:00:43.240> you<00:00:43.630> wouldn't

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:43.840 
on face value you wouldn't you wouldn't

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:45.840 
on face value you wouldn't you wouldn't
think<00:00:44.140> so<00:00:44.290> I<00:00:44.440> mean<00:00:44.740> in<00:00:44.920> terms<00:00:45.070> of<00:00:45.340> actually

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:45.850 
think so I mean in terms of actually

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:48.090 
think so I mean in terms of actually
making<00:00:46.000> a<00:00:46.270> stand<00:00:46.600> what<00:00:47.350> you've<00:00:47.500> got<00:00:47.680> really<00:00:48.010> is

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:48.100 
making a stand what you've got really is

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:49.890 
making a stand what you've got really is
just<00:00:48.250> the<00:00:48.430> one<00:00:48.610> angle<00:00:48.940> the<00:00:49.120> one<00:00:49.270> hinge<00:00:49.540> there

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:49.900 
just the one angle the one hinge there

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:51.750 
just the one angle the one hinge there
but<00:00:50.230> it's<00:00:50.590> not<00:00:50.920> that<00:00:51.160> that<00:00:51.340> makes<00:00:51.550> it

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:51.760 
but it's not that that makes it

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.510 
but it's not that that makes it
versatile<00:00:52.390> it's<00:00:52.900> this<00:00:53.410> and<00:00:53.680> this<00:00:53.890> is<00:00:54.100> the<00:00:54.250> tab

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:54.520 
versatile it's this and this is the tab

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:58.920 
versatile it's this and this is the tab
which<00:00:55.210> goes<00:00:55.480> through<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:57.280> loop<00:00:57.780> it's<00:00:58.780> got<00:00:58.900> a

00:00:58.920 --> 00:00:58.930 
which goes through the loop it's got a

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:01.140 
which goes through the loop it's got a
tab<00:00:59.260> and<00:00:59.500> loop<00:00:59.740> closure<00:01:00.130> system<00:01:00.430> so<00:01:00.790> not<00:01:00.970> only

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:01.150 
tab and loop closure system so not only

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:03.420 
tab and loop closure system so not only
does<00:01:01.450> it<00:01:01.510> keep<00:01:01.780> it<00:01:01.990> closed<00:01:02.350> you<00:01:02.740> pop<00:01:03.040> the<00:01:03.220> tab

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:03.430 
does it keep it closed you pop the tab

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:05.760 
does it keep it closed you pop the tab
through<00:01:03.760> the<00:01:03.940> loop<00:01:04.119> like<00:01:04.360> so<00:01:04.390> and<00:01:05.350> that<00:01:05.500> keeps

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:05.770 
through the loop like so and that keeps

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:07.710 
through the loop like so and that keeps
it<00:01:05.950> closed<00:01:06.189> on<00:01:06.369> your<00:01:06.549> ipad's<00:01:06.970> inside<00:01:07.420> it<00:01:07.600> but

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:07.720 
it closed on your ipad's inside it but

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.080 
it closed on your ipad's inside it but
also<00:01:08.250> when<00:01:09.250> it<00:01:09.370> goes<00:01:09.520> around<00:01:09.730> the<00:01:09.850> other<00:01:10.000> way

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:10.090 
also when it goes around the other way

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:12.240 
also when it goes around the other way
that's<00:01:10.720> what<00:01:10.960> becomes<00:01:11.290> your<00:01:11.560> stand<00:01:11.890> and

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:12.250 
that's what becomes your stand and

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:14.910 
that's what becomes your stand and
depending<00:01:12.970> on<00:01:13.120> how<00:01:13.300> far<00:01:13.990> you<00:01:14.260> push<00:01:14.530> the<00:01:14.710> tab

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:14.920 
depending on how far you push the tab

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:18.140 
depending on how far you push the tab
through<00:01:15.250> the<00:01:15.400> loop<00:01:16.080> that<00:01:17.080> changes<00:01:17.770> the<00:01:17.950> angle

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
through the loop that changes the angle

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.270 
through the loop that changes the angle
that<00:01:19.150> you<00:01:19.330> view<00:01:19.600> your<00:01:19.780> videos<00:01:20.170> or<00:01:20.530> FaceTime

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:21.280 
that you view your videos or FaceTime

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:22.770 
that you view your videos or FaceTime
calls<00:01:21.580> or<00:01:21.790> whatever<00:01:22.060> are<00:01:22.270> what<00:01:22.420> makes<00:01:22.630> it

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:22.780 
calls or whatever are what makes it

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:24.300 
calls or whatever are what makes it
really<00:01:22.930> versatile<00:01:23.560> because<00:01:23.740> you<00:01:23.950> can<00:01:24.070> have<00:01:24.190> it

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:24.310 
really versatile because you can have it

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:27.690 
really versatile because you can have it
almost<00:01:24.960> vertical<00:01:25.960> and<00:01:26.230> then<00:01:26.920> you<00:01:27.190> can<00:01:27.370> kind<00:01:27.580> of

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:27.700 
almost vertical and then you can kind of

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:29.550 
almost vertical and then you can kind of
pull<00:01:27.880> it<00:01:28.000> back<00:01:28.210> push<00:01:28.600> it<00:01:28.750> back<00:01:28.930> push<00:01:29.200> it<00:01:29.350> back

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:29.560 
pull it back push it back push it back

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:31.620 
pull it back push it back push it back
and<00:01:29.890> you<00:01:30.460> get<00:01:30.640> some<00:01:30.850> really<00:01:31.090> comfortable

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:31.630 
and you get some really comfortable

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:34.050 
and you get some really comfortable
viewing<00:01:31.840> angles<00:01:32.290> in<00:01:32.440> there<00:01:32.620> and<00:01:32.830> you'll<00:01:33.130> more

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:34.060 
viewing angles in there and you'll more

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:35.370 
viewing angles in there and you'll more
than<00:01:34.090> likely<00:01:34.270> find<00:01:34.870> something<00:01:35.229> that<00:01:35.350> suits

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:35.380 
than likely find something that suits

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:37.140 
than likely find something that suits
you<00:01:35.890> obviously<00:01:36.490> if<00:01:36.580> you<00:01:36.670> turn<00:01:36.880> it<00:01:37.030> the<00:01:37.120> other

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:37.150 
you obviously if you turn it the other

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:39.750 
you obviously if you turn it the other
way<00:01:37.270> around<00:01:37.630> then<00:01:37.900> it<00:01:38.050> becomes<00:01:38.580> typing<00:01:39.580> angle

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:39.760 
way around then it becomes typing angle

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:41.760 
way around then it becomes typing angle
which<00:01:40.150> again<00:01:40.450> you<00:01:40.659> can<00:01:40.840> adjust<00:01:40.960> to<00:01:41.530> soup

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:41.770 
which again you can adjust to soup

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:43.950 
which again you can adjust to soup
whichever<00:01:42.400> angle<00:01:42.850> you<00:01:42.970> prefer<00:01:43.300> to<00:01:43.330> type<00:01:43.690> with

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:43.960 
whichever angle you prefer to type with

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.380 
whichever angle you prefer to type with
and<00:01:44.140> Matt<00:01:44.320> that's<00:01:45.159> made<00:01:45.430> it<00:01:45.610> very<00:01:45.820> versatile

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:46.390 
and Matt that's made it very versatile

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:48.060 
and Matt that's made it very versatile
indeed<00:01:46.720> now<00:01:46.900> he<00:01:46.960> tells<00:01:47.170> are<00:01:47.380> actually<00:01:47.650> design
