00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:57.850 
and you also want to do this when you're
going<00:01:56.780> a<00:01:56.840> little<00:01:56.870> bit<00:01:57.080> wet<00:01:57.320> because<00:01:57.530> if<00:01:57.770> this

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 
going a little bit wet because if this

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.880 
going a little bit wet because if this
is<00:01:58.010> all<00:01:58.130> dry<00:01:58.310> you<00:01:58.930> have<00:01:59.930> a<00:02:00.050> really<00:02:00.530> hard<00:02:00.680> time

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890 
is all dry you have a really hard time

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:03.340 
is all dry you have a really hard time
and<00:02:01.540> getting<00:02:02.540> another<00:02:02.780> because<00:02:03.050> the<00:02:03.170> leaves

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.350 
and getting another because the leaves

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:05.980 
and getting another because the leaves
would<00:02:03.470> just<00:02:03.650> you<00:02:04.070> know<00:02:04.150> they<00:02:05.150> bunch<00:02:05.630> up<00:02:05.750> and<00:02:05.930> go

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:05.990 
would just you know they bunch up and go

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:09.100 
would just you know they bunch up and go
over<00:02:06.110> the<00:02:06.200> top<00:02:06.350> of<00:02:06.470> it<00:02:07.630> but<00:02:08.630> this<00:02:08.899> actually

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110 
over the top of it but this actually

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:10.570 
over the top of it but this actually
really<00:02:09.350> full<00:02:09.679> so<00:02:09.890> it's<00:02:10.010> getting<00:02:10.220> people<00:02:10.310> bit

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:10.580 
really full so it's getting people bit

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:17.930 
really full so it's getting people bit
more<00:02:10.760> effort<00:02:10.940> to<00:02:11.270> get<00:02:11.390> it<00:02:11.480> cleaned<00:02:11.660> out

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940
