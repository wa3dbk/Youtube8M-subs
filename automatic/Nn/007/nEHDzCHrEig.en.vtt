in so the numerous style that's very

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:22.120 
in so the numerous style that's very
difficult<00:01:19.990> actually<00:01:20.990> impossible<00:01:21.770> to<00:01:21.860> put<00:01:22.010> in

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:43.610 
really great it also needs a very very

really great it also needs a very very

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:47.720 
very flat and smooth surface I found

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.140 
very flat and smooth surface I found
that<00:01:47.930> even<00:01:48.170> on<00:01:48.979> the<00:01:49.430> slightest<00:01:50.000> little

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:50.150 
that even on the slightest little

that even on the slightest little
surface<00:01:50.720> imperfection<00:01:51.409> would<00:01:52.040> have<00:01:52.190> trouble

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:52.460 
surface imperfection would have trouble

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:55.390 
surface imperfection would have trouble
turning<00:01:53.470> so<00:01:54.470> I<00:01:54.530> have<00:01:54.680> to<00:01:54.830> stop

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:55.400 
turning so I have to stop

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.120 
turning so I have to stop
maybe<00:01:56.180> jerk<00:01:56.810> it<00:01:56.960> a<00:01:56.990> little<00:01:57.260> bit<00:01:57.409> to<00:01:57.830> get<00:01:57.979> it<00:01:58.040> to

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.130 
maybe jerk it a little bit to get it to

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:09.309 
maybe jerk it a little bit to get it to
turn<00:01:58.340> the<00:01:58.580> way<00:01:58.700> I<00:01:58.729> wanted

00:02:09.309 --> 00:02:09.319 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:11.960 

it<00:02:10.319> also<00:02:10.440> turned<00:02:10.800> better<00:02:11.099> in<00:02:11.489> one<00:02:11.760> direction

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
it also turned better in one direction

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.420 
it also turned better in one direction
than<00:02:12.569> the<00:02:12.690> other<00:02:12.900> no<00:02:13.709> matter<00:02:13.890> how<00:02:14.069> much<00:02:14.280> I

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
than the other no matter how much I

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.780

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:47.350 
never had a problem with the car falling
off<00:02:45.110> of<00:02:45.140> the<00:02:45.290> wall<00:02:45.620> but<00:02:46.580> when<00:02:47.060> it's<00:02:47.180> in<00:02:47.300> a

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 
off of the wall but when it's in a

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.480 
off of the wall but when it's in a
vertical<00:02:47.810> position<00:02:47.930> he<00:02:48.890> really<00:02:49.070> has<00:02:49.190> a<00:02:49.220> lot<00:02:49.310> of

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:49.490 
vertical position he really has a lot of

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:51.880 
vertical position he really has a lot of
trouble<00:02:49.760> going<00:02:50.030> in<00:02:50.270> one<00:02:50.510> direction<00:02:50.540> I<00:02:51.290> kept

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:51.890 
trouble going in one direction I kept

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:53.560 
trouble going in one direction I kept
wanting<00:02:52.040> to<00:02:52.280> slide<00:02:52.550> to<00:02:52.820> one<00:02:52.850> side<00:02:53.000> or<00:02:53.270> to<00:02:53.540> the

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:53.570 
wanting to slide to one side or to the

00:02:53.570 --> 00:03:02.840 
wanting to slide to one side or to the
other

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:02.850 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:10.770 

next<00:03:03.850> I<00:03:03.940> tried<00:03:04.180> it<00:03:04.300> on<00:03:04.360> the<00:03:04.540> ceiling

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:10.780 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:13.780 

upside<00:03:11.780> down<00:03:11.950> the<00:03:12.950> car<00:03:13.130> really<00:03:13.370> came<00:03:13.640> alive

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 
upside down the car really came alive

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:16.060 
upside down the car really came alive
this<00:03:14.510> is<00:03:14.660> obviously<00:03:15.110> where<00:03:15.410> it<00:03:15.530> wants<00:03:15.890> to<00:03:15.950> be

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:16.070 
this is obviously where it wants to be

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:19.930 
this is obviously where it wants to be
driven<00:03:17.500> it<00:03:18.500> still<00:03:18.770> turned<00:03:19.460> a<00:03:19.610> little<00:03:19.850> bit

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:19.940 
driven it still turned a little bit

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:21.430 
driven it still turned a little bit
better<00:03:20.120> in<00:03:20.360> one<00:03:20.570> direction<00:03:20.720> than<00:03:21.140> the<00:03:21.260> other

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:21.440 
better in one direction than the other

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:23.710 
better in one direction than the other
again<00:03:22.100> no<00:03:22.340> matter<00:03:22.460> how<00:03:22.700> much<00:03:22.850> I<00:03:23.030> adjusted<00:03:23.600> to

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:23.720 
again no matter how much I adjusted to

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:27.070 
again no matter how much I adjusted to
trim<00:03:24.640> but<00:03:25.640> I<00:03:25.670> really<00:03:25.970> didn't<00:03:26.210> have<00:03:26.330> to<00:03:26.540> stop<00:03:26.840> it

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:27.080 
trim but I really didn't have to stop it

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:51.520
