00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:53.350 
I knew the risk factors of obesity but I
guess<00:03:51.140> I<00:03:51.260> just<00:03:51.290> didn't<00:03:51.770> consider<00:03:52.190> that<00:03:52.360> with

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:53.360 
guess I just didn't consider that with

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:55.510 
guess I just didn't consider that with
me<00:03:53.630> that<00:03:54.050> was<00:03:54.200> sort<00:03:54.380> of<00:03:54.440> a<00:03:54.530> wake-up<00:03:54.890> call<00:03:54.950> so<00:03:55.490> I

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:55.520 
me that was sort of a wake-up call so I

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:58.170 
me that was sort of a wake-up call so I
just<00:03:55.850> decided<00:03:56.030> I<00:03:56.480> have<00:03:57.050> to<00:03:57.200> do<00:03:57.320> something<00:03:57.590> I

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:58.180 
just decided I have to do something I

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:01.900 
just decided I have to do something I
saw<00:03:59.180> the<00:03:59.240> power<00:03:59.630> 90<00:04:00.110> infomercial<00:04:01.100> with<00:04:01.580> Tony

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:01.910

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:04.960 
saw the power 90 infomercial with Tony
and<00:04:02.240> I<00:04:02.870> thought<00:04:03.080> that<00:04:03.410> looks<00:04:03.650> sensible<00:04:04.160> and<00:04:04.550> I

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:04.970 
and I thought that looks sensible and I

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:07.720 
and I thought that looks sensible and I
think<00:04:05.180> I<00:04:05.300> can<00:04:05.510> do<00:04:05.660> it<00:04:05.690> ultimately<00:04:06.530> at<00:04:06.800> the<00:04:07.070> very

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:07.730 
think I can do it ultimately at the very

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:11.020 
think I can do it ultimately at the very
