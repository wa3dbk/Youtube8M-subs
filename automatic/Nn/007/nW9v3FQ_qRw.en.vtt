00:00:05.899 --> 00:00:09.620
 the hot pot 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:17.550
 Hungry use once roamed the 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:20.250
 forest in search of food 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.529
 the time of scarcity 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.949
 but his light and fable smelled the scent 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:28.010
 of food and took him to the 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:31.890
 hunters 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:35.880
 upon arriving there that bear realizing that 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:39.629
 the camp was empty then it was until 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:44.100
 the burning fire and embers and the beautiful 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:47.579
 took a pot of food when the 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.910
 panela was already out of the bonfire that 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:53.579
 What is left of you with all your might 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:58.230
 he stuck his head inside her and started 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:01:00.020
 devour everything but that bear 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.430
 I hugged the pan 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:07.590
 he began to perceive something 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:11.070
 reaching for the heat of that pot that 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:13.770
 just been taken out of the fire 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:17.010
 he was being burned on his feet in the 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:22.260
 chest and where else that pan 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:28.350
 this was never the case. 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:30.630
 experienced that sensation then he 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:34.410
 interpreted those burns by his 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:36.950
 body as something that wanted to take away the 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:36.950
 your food 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:44.970
 began to honor very high and 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:47.009
 The higher praises him, but he 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:51.810
 pressed a hot pan against his 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:55.050
 immense body and the more the pan 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:57.810
 hot and burned that bear 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:02:03.020
 pressed against his body and higher 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:06.690
 even today when hunters 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:09.030
 arrived at the camp they found 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:13.470
 so that use leaning against a tree 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:17.760
 next to dust that bear still 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:20.790
 held that food use pot 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:23.430
 had so many burns that they had 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:25.760
 that the pot would stick in its immense 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.760
 body 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:35.230
 even dead that use had not yet 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:35.230
 expression is collapsing 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:42.480
 O 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:45.420
 in our lives for many times 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:47.000
 we embrace certain things that we believe to be 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:49.790
 important 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.290
 some of them make us the kind of pain 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:56.970
 not from the outside and also from 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:03:01.770
 in and even then there still believe 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:04.320
 we are afraid of abandoning them and 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:09.000
 this fear puts us in a situation of 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:11.400
 suffering and also despair 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.880
 so we choose these things against the 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:17.360
 our hearts and we ended up defeated 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:22.470
 for something we both protect 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:23.820
 we believe and defend them so that everything 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:26.370
 work in your life 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:29.820
 it is necessary to recognize in certain 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:33.390
 moments that not always what seems to be 

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:36.020
 salvation will give you conditions to 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:36.020
 proceed 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:42.210
 have courage and the vision that the 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:46.040
 had to get out of his way 

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:50.120
 everything that makes your heart beat 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:50.120
 drop the pan
