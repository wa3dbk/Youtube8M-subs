water bottles and cooking implements if
you<00:00:10.110> haven't<00:00:10.380> checked<00:00:10.559> my<00:00:10.650> previous<00:00:11.070> video<00:00:11.340> I

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
you haven't checked my previous video I

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.370 
you haven't checked my previous video I
suggest<00:00:11.519> doing<00:00:11.969> so<00:00:12.179> it's<00:00:12.330> about<00:00:12.599> bug-out<00:00:13.080> bags

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
suggest doing so it's about bug-out bags

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.580 
suggest doing so it's about bug-out bags
I<00:00:13.650> think<00:00:14.250> it<00:00:14.400> turned<00:00:14.670> out<00:00:14.790> quite<00:00:15.030> well

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
I think it turned out quite well

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.609 
I think it turned out quite well
I<00:00:16.619> was<00:00:17.279> talking<00:00:17.640> about<00:00:17.699> how<00:00:18.150> more<00:00:19.080> versatile

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
I was talking about how more versatile

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.620 
I was talking about how more versatile
it<00:00:19.770> is<00:00:19.890> to<00:00:20.070> have<00:00:20.250> a<00:00:20.279> stainless<00:00:20.760> steel<00:00:20.939> bottle

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
it is to have a stainless steel bottle

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.240 
it is to have a stainless steel bottle
such<00:00:21.810> as<00:00:21.960> this<00:00:22.080> one<00:00:22.320> it's<00:00:22.710> not<00:00:22.859> only<00:00:23.039> about

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
such as this one it's not only about

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.000 
such as this one it's not only about
being<00:00:23.310> much<00:00:23.789> more<00:00:24.029> solid<00:00:24.359> more<00:00:24.840> resistant<00:00:25.470> to

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
being much more solid more resistant to

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.920 
being much more solid more resistant to
constant<00:00:26.580> use<00:00:26.849> and<00:00:27.060> you'll<00:00:27.449> see<00:00:27.720> this

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
constant use and you'll see this

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.200 
constant use and you'll see this
yourself<00:00:28.140> if<00:00:28.560> you<00:00:28.650> start<00:00:28.890> EDC<00:00:29.490> carrying

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
yourself if you start EDC carrying

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.150 
yourself if you start EDC carrying
carrying<00:00:30.900> it<00:00:30.990> in<00:00:31.109> a<00:00:31.170> backpack<00:00:31.349> every<00:00:31.740> single

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
carrying it in a backpack every single

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.490 
carrying it in a backpack every single
day<00:00:32.279> a<00:00:32.309> water<00:00:32.820> bottle<00:00:33.090> you'll<00:00:33.690> see<00:00:34.050> the

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
day a water bottle you'll see the

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.560 
day a water bottle you'll see the
difference<00:00:34.980> aluminum<00:00:35.550> is<00:00:35.790> a<00:00:35.850> little<00:00:36.329> bit<00:00:36.420> more

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
difference aluminum is a little bit more

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.020 
difference aluminum is a little bit more
fragile<00:00:36.840> and<00:00:37.230> with<00:00:38.100> the<00:00:38.190> constant<00:00:38.550> bumps

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
fragile and with the constant bumps

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.639 
fragile and with the constant bumps
three<00:00:39.300> years<00:00:39.629> you'll<00:00:39.960> see<00:00:40.200> the<00:00:40.320> difference

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
three years you'll see the difference

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.060 
three years you'll see the difference
besides<00:00:41.219> that<00:00:41.820> in<00:00:42.170> even<00:00:43.170> more<00:00:43.530> important

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
besides that in even more important

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.410 
besides that in even more important
during<00:00:44.250> an<00:00:44.340> emergency<00:00:44.520> these<00:00:45.059> can<00:00:45.300> actually

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
during an emergency these can actually

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.380 
during an emergency these can actually
be<00:00:45.660> used<00:00:46.160> for<00:00:47.160> boiling<00:00:47.460> water<00:00:47.879> and<00:00:48.120> even

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
be used for boiling water and even

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.869 
be used for boiling water and even
cooking<00:00:48.660> if<00:00:49.590> you<00:00:49.860> use<00:00:50.039> the<00:00:50.250> ones<00:00:50.430> that<00:00:50.550> are

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
cooking if you use the ones that are

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.520 
cooking if you use the ones that are
made<00:00:51.120> of<00:00:51.239> aluminum<00:00:51.719> they<00:00:51.809> have<00:00:51.960> a<00:00:51.989> liner<00:00:52.289> on

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
made of aluminum they have a liner on

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:53.779 
made of aluminum they have a liner on
the<00:00:52.590> inside<00:00:52.949> and<00:00:53.070> they<00:00:53.160> cannot<00:00:53.399> go<00:00:53.610> directly

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
the inside and they cannot go directly

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.760 
the inside and they cannot go directly
into<00:00:54.180> the<00:00:54.329> flame<00:00:54.539> of<00:00:54.780> course<00:00:55.410> a<00:00:55.559> plastic

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
into the flame of course a plastic

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.069 
into the flame of course a plastic
bottle<00:00:56.430> would<00:00:56.969> have<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.360> same<00:00:57.510> problem<00:00:57.960> would

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
bottle would have the same problem would

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.470 
bottle would have the same problem would
not<00:00:58.140> be<00:00:58.320> able<00:00:58.559> to<00:00:58.710> go<00:00:58.980> into<00:00:59.190> a<00:00:59.309> fire<00:00:59.579> for<00:00:59.940> for

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
not be able to go into a fire for for

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.889 
not be able to go into a fire for for
cooking<00:01:00.690> boiling<00:01:01.170> water<00:01:01.520> so<00:01:02.520> basically<00:01:03.090> the

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
cooking boiling water so basically the

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.109 
cooking boiling water so basically the
way<00:01:03.930> I<00:01:04.080> would<00:01:04.500> use<00:01:04.650> this<00:01:04.860> and<00:01:05.159> have<00:01:05.670> used<00:01:06.000> it

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
way I would use this and have used it

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.060 
way I would use this and have used it
before<00:01:06.270> is<00:01:06.689> you<00:01:06.990> put<00:01:07.200> it<00:01:07.320> on<00:01:07.409> you<00:01:07.619> start<00:01:07.979> your

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
before is you put it on you start your

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.950 
before is you put it on you start your
fire<00:01:08.280> or<00:01:08.430> have<00:01:08.549> a<00:01:08.610> little<00:01:08.700> bit<00:01:08.880> of<00:01:08.909> of<00:01:09.210> Amber's

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
fire or have a little bit of of Amber's

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.359 
fire or have a little bit of of Amber's
going<00:01:10.140> on<00:01:10.320> there<00:01:10.530> you<00:01:10.710> put<00:01:10.920> it<00:01:11.010> there

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
going on there you put it there

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.010 
going on there you put it there
and<00:01:11.460> when<00:01:12.210> you<00:01:12.299> have<00:01:12.420> to<00:01:12.510> pick<00:01:12.689> it<00:01:12.780> up<00:01:12.869> you

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
and when you have to pick it up you

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.289 
and when you have to pick it up you

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:21.590 
that case as you see there's a good
chance<00:01:20.400> of<00:01:20.549> you<00:01:20.670> burning<00:01:20.909> quite<00:01:21.240> a<00:01:21.299> bit<00:01:21.509> of

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
convenient as an actual a cup because it

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.840 
convenient as an actual a cup because it

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
mouth is wide enough but it's not like a

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.789 
mouth is wide enough but it's not like a
cup<00:01:57.240> basically<00:01:57.930> you<00:01:58.020> can<00:01:58.170> use<00:01:58.200> you<00:01:58.530> can<00:01:58.649> either

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
cup basically you can use you can either

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.530 
cup basically you can use you can either
make<00:01:59.009> a<00:01:59.100> spoon<00:01:59.369> yourself<00:01:59.729> with<00:01:59.880> a<00:01:59.909> stick<00:02:00.270> which

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
make a spoon yourself with a stick which

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.840 
make a spoon yourself with a stick which
is<00:02:00.899> it's<00:02:01.469> pretty<00:02:01.740> entertaining<00:02:02.009> but<00:02:02.490> does

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
is it's pretty entertaining but does

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.910 
is it's pretty entertaining but does
take<00:02:03.119> some<00:02:03.360> time<00:02:03.420> can<00:02:04.110> use<00:02:04.229> a<00:02:04.259> spoon<00:02:04.649> like<00:02:04.680> this

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
take some time can use a spoon like this

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.809 
take some time can use a spoon like this
I'm<00:02:05.430> not<00:02:05.610> much<00:02:05.820> of<00:02:05.850> a<00:02:06.030> fan<00:02:06.360> of<00:02:06.590> plastic<00:02:07.819> forks

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
I'm not much of a fan of plastic forks

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.480 
I'm not much of a fan of plastic forks
and<00:02:08.970> spoons<00:02:09.060> I<00:02:09.690> you<00:02:10.170> know<00:02:10.259> I<00:02:10.289> think<00:02:10.500> the

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:11.490 
and spoons I you know I think the

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:13.540 
and spoons I you know I think the
the<00:02:11.760> medal<00:02:12.570> is<00:02:12.690> a<00:02:12.720> much<00:02:12.960> better<00:02:13.140> alternative

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:13.550 
the medal is a much better alternative

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:17.390 
the medal is a much better alternative
so<00:02:14.570> just<00:02:15.570> get<00:02:16.230> one<00:02:16.410> of<00:02:16.500> these<00:02:16.620> a<00:02:16.980> little<00:02:17.100> bit<00:02:17.220> of

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
so just get one of these a little bit of

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.400 
so just get one of these a little bit of
a<00:02:17.490> bigger<00:02:17.730> spoon<00:02:18.090> like<00:02:18.360> this<00:02:18.570> one<00:02:18.780> there's

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
a bigger spoon like this one there's

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.490 
a bigger spoon like this one there's
actually<00:02:19.800> reach<00:02:20.040> down<00:02:20.490> to<00:02:20.730> the<00:02:20.820> bottom

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
actually reach down to the bottom

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.730 
actually reach down to the bottom
they're<00:02:22.500> just<00:02:23.460> the<00:02:23.760> exact<00:02:24.120> size<00:02:24.360> and<00:02:25.260> you<00:02:25.590> can

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:25.740 
they're just the exact size and you can

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:27.950 
they're just the exact size and you can
scoop<00:02:26.130> nicely<00:02:26.700> in<00:02:26.850> there<00:02:27.060> if<00:02:27.270> you<00:02:27.390> have<00:02:27.420> past

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:27.960 
scoop nicely in there if you have past

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:29.720 
scoop nicely in there if you have past
or<00:02:28.200> anything<00:02:28.320> you<00:02:28.620> can<00:02:28.770> scoop<00:02:29.130> nicely<00:02:29.640> in

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
or anything you can scoop nicely in

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.880 
or anything you can scoop nicely in
there<00:02:29.880> and<00:02:30.240> what<00:02:31.020> are<00:02:31.050> the<00:02:31.200> advantages<00:02:31.710> if

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
there and what are the advantages if

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.090 
there and what are the advantages if
it's<00:02:32.040> it's<00:02:32.310> less<00:02:32.550> likely<00:02:32.820> to<00:02:33.000> to<00:02:33.810> fall<00:02:34.080> if<00:02:34.980> you

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
it's it's less likely to to fall if you

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:36.260 
it's it's less likely to to fall if you
drop<00:02:35.310> it<00:02:35.430> on<00:02:35.490> the<00:02:35.610> side<00:02:35.820> it's<00:02:36.000> gonna<00:02:36.090> be

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.270 
drop it on the side it's gonna be

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:37.070 
drop it on the side it's gonna be
staying<00:02:36.540> in<00:02:36.690> there

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
staying in there

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.250 
staying in there
so<00:02:37.500> it's<00:02:37.800> not<00:02:37.920> all<00:02:38.160> that<00:02:38.190> bad<00:02:38.720> now<00:02:39.720> one<00:02:40.020> of<00:02:40.050> the

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
so it's not all that bad now one of the

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.560 
so it's not all that bad now one of the
problems<00:02:40.500> you<00:02:40.860> may<00:02:40.920> find<00:02:41.220> is<00:02:41.400> that<00:02:41.640> sometimes

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:42.570 
problems you may find is that sometimes

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:48.290 
problems you may find is that sometimes
the<00:02:43.350> spoon<00:02:44.150> does<00:02:45.150> not<00:02:45.390> fit<00:02:45.690> all<00:02:46.410> right<00:02:46.650> so<00:02:47.640> you

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
the spoon does not fit all right so you

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:49.730 
the spoon does not fit all right so you
have<00:02:48.390> to<00:02:48.480> be<00:02:48.660> a<00:02:48.690> little<00:02:48.810> bit<00:02:49.050> smart<00:02:49.350> about<00:02:49.530> that

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:49.740 
have to be a little bit smart about that

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:52.490 
have to be a little bit smart about that
and<00:02:50.130> maybe<00:02:50.910> do<00:02:51.720> a<00:02:51.780> little<00:02:51.900> bit<00:02:52.080> of<00:02:52.170> work

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
and maybe do a little bit of work

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.670 
and maybe do a little bit of work
yourself<00:02:52.950> okay<00:02:53.630> how<00:02:54.630> is<00:02:54.810> it<00:02:54.960> that<00:02:54.990> one<00:02:55.350> spoon

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
doesn't well it's not magic of course

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.170 
doesn't well it's not magic of course
something<00:03:02.040> something<00:03:02.640> has<00:03:02.760> been<00:03:02.970> done
