00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:06.740
 hello friends how are you welcome to 

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:09.350
 how to play and play on the guitar 

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:12.340
 and this time we're going to talk about what 

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:14.750
 we call the jon octave setting 

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:19.429
 when we buy a guitar 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:21.689
 electric well we have to touch it to 

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:23.980
 know if the guitar is good 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.480
 then the best we can do 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:28.480
 when we go to a music house is 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:31.239
 take a tuner the topic is that to 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:32.500
 Sometimes the strings are very old because 

00:00:31.239 --> 00:00:34.809
 The guitar has been around for a long time 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:37.570
 on display or are sometimes new and 

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:39.760
 new guitars sometimes take time 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:41.980
 tune with your tension then what 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:44.339
 It is advisable to take a long time 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:44.339
 for 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:49.309
 see that that guitar is good and equal if 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:51.230
 we have to spend an entire afternoon with a 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:53.179
 We did not have a guitar 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:55.809
 problem because we bought the guitar 

00:00:53.179 --> 00:01:00.649
 today we have it for life well 

00:00:55.809 --> 00:01:02.780
 So this is to know if the 

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:06.170
 guitar is good or bad 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:08.450
 obviously it is a process that in a 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:10.820
 House music is not usually done but 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:12.170
 it helps us to identify if the 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.909
 guitar is good or bad because already at 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:17.090
 seller we are going to tell you that this 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:19.039
 guitar is wrong octave da that is that 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.810
 the guitar this evil octave gives good 

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:22.700
 we have the mast of the 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:25.069
 guitar not then on each fret 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:28.159
 we have the notes then if we 

00:01:25.069 --> 00:01:30.289
 we play a string is that is either 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:31.970
 of six will give us a note if the 

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:34.789
 we play the air will give us for example 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:38.119
 in the sixth here to the national air a 

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:39.709
 note from me then in the eighth in the 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:42.220
 end of the eighth that is given to the fret two 

00:01:39.709 --> 00:01:45.620
 it has to sound a note from me 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:49.100
 perfect and identical to the note from me to 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:52.130
 air as we know this we take the 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:54.050
 tuner and then we are looking at the 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:57.860
 tuner that the poles generated 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:02:00.560
 tuners show you the exact point 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:03.680
 between one note and another and you can see the 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:07.159
 halftone values ​​does my tone we're going to 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:11.450
 notice the difference in values 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:13.489
 of halftone micro semitones we go to 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:15.890
 notice the difference between the 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:17.650
 note to the air and the footnote in the 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:19.420
 fret 12 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:23.170
 if there is no difference to say that the 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:25.090
 guitar is fine eighth perfect that 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:26.769
 it's a detail we can have in 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:28.840
 account when buying a guitar 

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:30.280
 that does not mean that the guitar is 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.159
 bad in the case of a guitar 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:36.730
 electrical has a solution in the case of 

00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:40.450
 an acoustic or classical guitar that does not 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:43.780
 has a solution because it is poorly manufactured 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:45.849
 is wrong, that is resolved in the 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:48.220
 moment of the manufacture of the guitar 

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:51.069
 in the distances that are taken in the 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:52.450
 fingerboard well that is if they are going to buy 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:56.049
 an acoustic guitar and a guitar 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:58.030
 classic look at how this octave gives and 

00:02:56.049 --> 00:03:00.340
 if it is not well finished it is not a 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:02.170
 good guitar because he's going to lie in 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:04.329
 different places when we are going to play 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:06.730
 and that means it 's going to sound bad and 

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:08.349
 it's a bad guitar out there in the 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:10.269
 first frets sounds very nice the 

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:12.459
 we try to make chords there what a beautiful 

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:13.930
 that sounds but means that the 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:17.620
 guitar is not good if we want 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:18.830
 work on higher notes is not going to 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:21.260
 go very well 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:26.120
 then it is the electric guitar if 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:28.490
 we can solve this kind of problems 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:30.950
 most guitar bridges 

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:33.980
 Electric has an individual setting 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:36.640
 for each string with this setting we 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:40.990
 let's ensure that the guitar 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:44.390
 remains tuned in the entire mast well 

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:47.360
 so for example this is the bridge 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:50.360
 from the stratum, here we have some 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:54.320
 screws with springs 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:59.180
 and to solve the theme of the octave 

00:03:54.320 --> 00:04:02.390
 tion we play in the eighth in the 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:06.800
 but we play in the twelfth 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:09.470
 fret on the 12th fret we stepped on the note 

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:13.520
 we do the process that I told them before 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:17.420
 the note to the air and treading here see how 

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:19.130
 then refine what we do for 

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:23.720
 example here this would be the sixth one 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:26.000
 then we play then if I yes 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:29.650
 we tighten the screw we loose the 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:32.240
 rope if we loose the screw 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:33.980
 we tighten the rope then yes 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:37.550
 we loose the screw we loose the 

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:41.990
 attention that is that we lower the note and with 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:45.039
 this we can graduate the tuning as 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:48.259
 if we were touching the plug 

00:04:45.039 --> 00:04:50.449
 we understand then with this we go 

00:04:48.259 --> 00:04:55.429
 graduating that the first one has to be 

00:04:50.449 --> 00:04:58.549
 of course not la la la la las las 

00:04:55.429 --> 00:05:00.709
 scales has to be well tuned the 

00:04:58.549 --> 00:05:02.959
 we have to fine tune and make it perfect or 

00:05:00.709 --> 00:05:05.449
 I'll try it on the air 

00:05:02.959 --> 00:05:08.689
 after we step on here we will see the 

00:05:05.449 --> 00:05:10.669
 difference if the difference is greater or 

00:05:08.689 --> 00:05:12.649
 that is higher we have to 

00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:15.649
 loosen the so if we have to 

00:05:12.649 --> 00:05:20.479
 loosen we have to tighten and good and 

00:05:15.649 --> 00:05:23.149
 so if the attention is lower we have 

00:05:20.479 --> 00:05:24.919
 to loosen up and so on continuously and what 

00:05:23.149 --> 00:05:27.529
 same goes with this that is done with 

00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:30.499
 allen key here for guitars 

00:05:27.529 --> 00:05:32.419
 them paul for example that have this 

00:05:30.499 --> 00:05:36.050
 type of bridge we do it with the key 

00:05:32.419 --> 00:05:39.739
 allen and the floating bridges 

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:43.489
 floyd royce these also go with the one 

00:05:39.739 --> 00:05:46.309
 allen key that we are loosening and we are going 

00:05:43.489 --> 00:05:48.009
 varying the height of the note and with this 

00:05:46.309 --> 00:05:51.060
 we chose the guitar and we left 

00:05:48.009 --> 00:05:53.610
 perfect then free us 

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:55.860
 of the problem of knowing if the guitar 

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:57.240
 we throw away now we keep using because in 

00:05:55.860 --> 00:06:00.060
 reality was a problem of octava tion 

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:01.470
 well here you can also see another detail 

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:02.840
 what he had talked about in other videos of 

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:04.980
 what is microfiction 

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:06.270
 these are the floating bridges that 

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:09.419
 they usually have guitars 

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:11.040
 same and they have these pearls that 

00:06:09.419 --> 00:06:13.249
 besides the pegs that go here 

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:15.619
 they have 

00:06:13.249 --> 00:06:17.449
 this makes the tuning more 

00:06:15.619 --> 00:06:19.309
 perfect the moss row so much for the 

00:06:17.449 --> 00:06:22.249
 pegs as per the microfinance here 

00:06:19.309 --> 00:06:25.629
 Well, I hope you have served them and 

00:06:22.249 --> 00:06:25.629
 see you next lucky
