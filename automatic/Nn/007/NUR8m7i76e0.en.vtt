this is only for the new PSP and this is
for<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:34.829> iPod<00:01:35.189> or<00:01:35.340> iPhone<00:01:35.960> this<00:01:36.960> was<00:01:37.770> 20<00:01:38.100> bucks

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:38.750 
for the iPod or iPhone this was 20 bucks

for the iPod or iPhone this was 20 bucks
this<00:01:39.750> was<00:01:40.740> 50<00:01:41.400> yeah<00:01:42.299> Apple<00:01:42.840> doesn't<00:01:43.020> have

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
markup not at all and they do the same

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.310 
markup not at all and they do the same
thing<00:01:46.649> for<00:01:47.189> different<00:01:47.549> devices<00:01:47.850> mind<00:01:48.299> you<00:01:48.479> so

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
thing for different devices mind you so

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.130 
thing for different devices mind you so
as<00:01:49.890> I<00:01:50.040> said<00:01:50.280> this<00:01:50.460> is<00:01:50.670> a<00:01:50.700> fully<00:01:51.000> working<00:01:51.210> PSP<00:01:51.930> as

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
as I said this is a fully working PSP as

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.399 
as I said this is a fully working PSP as
connected<00:01:52.890> to<00:01:53.250> my<00:01:53.579> television<00:01:54.329> or<00:01:54.479> any<00:01:54.750> video

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
connected to my television or any video

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.260 
connected to my television or any video
and/or<00:01:55.920> audio<00:01:55.979> source<00:01:56.640> at<00:01:56.820> least<00:01:56.969> video

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
and/or audio source at least video

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.590 
and/or audio source at least video
sourcing<00:01:57.689> takes<00:01:58.100> component<00:01:59.100> cables<00:01:59.969> that's

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
sourcing takes component cables that's

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.800 
sourcing takes component cables that's
the<00:02:00.810> one<00:02:01.170> drawback<00:02:01.770> I<00:02:02.159> find<00:02:02.490> to<00:02:02.820> these<00:02:03.299> cables

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
the one drawback I find to these cables

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.120 
the one drawback I find to these cables
is<00:02:03.899> that<00:02:04.049> they<00:02:04.110> don't<00:02:04.229> retract<00:02:04.740> upon

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
is that they don't retract upon

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.010 
is that they don't retract upon
themselves<00:02:05.340> so<00:02:06.030> I<00:02:06.060> got<00:02:06.240> to<00:02:06.329> carry<00:02:06.509> this<00:02:06.689> long

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
themselves so I got to carry this long

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.710 
themselves so I got to carry this long
cable<00:02:07.740> around<00:02:07.979> but<00:02:08.220> the<00:02:08.640> benefit<00:02:08.970> is<00:02:09.000> is<00:02:09.360> that

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
cable around but the benefit is is that

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.250 
cable around but the benefit is is that
if<00:02:09.810> I've<00:02:09.929> got<00:02:10.110> something<00:02:10.500> on<00:02:10.709> here<00:02:10.920> that<00:02:10.950> I

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
if I've got something on here that I

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.920 
if I've got something on here that I
there<00:02:11.680> I<00:02:12.040> can<00:02:12.760> do<00:02:12.879> it<00:02:13.030> then<00:02:13.269> for<00:02:13.450> twenty<00:02:13.689> bucks

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
there I can do it then for twenty bucks

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.009 
there I can do it then for twenty bucks
