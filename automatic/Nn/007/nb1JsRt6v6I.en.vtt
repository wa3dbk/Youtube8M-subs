00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:14.910
 hello everyone on log phone repair checks 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:20.340
 sony model c6603 I think it goes like 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:26.430
 zetka that's the problem is broken 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:27.390
 the back of the back cover she 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:35.160
 glass 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:39.180
 here as it is visible that is, as on the iPhone 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:43.140
 fours glass cover easy 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:46.980
 beating and breaking now I'll show you 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:49.309
 how zhezh easy to replace it all wrong 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.309
 too difficult 

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:58.710
 first men thin sharp 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:03.870
 the tool I used the spatula here 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:08.250
 such you can use the old one 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:11.549
 SIM card sharpened tweezers or else 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:16.080
 something such as a start, we need to 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:18.810
 should warm up this part can be finals 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:24.110
 can be ordinary film can be in-law and dinner 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:30.409
 pictured mother take warm up these 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:36.350
 areas and thereby 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:44.040
 prying tool neatly 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:47.509
 1 times to connect this back cover 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:52.310
 that is, here you are 

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:52.310
 defend 2-sided tape 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:59.850
 and the cover is removed that is 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:04.799
 I draw your attention to this one here 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:15.739
 parts are only here a sticky layer and 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:18.510
 need to tear off further as easy 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:23.810
 replace the battery with water here 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:27.830
 here are big too there were cases that 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:31.800
 battery stupidly failing 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:34.350
 as we see this 100 was already under repair 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:41.000
 and this part here it should be 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:41.000
 white it is different from white 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:49.739
 I ordered riney ordered paid back availability 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:53.010
 already had a new back cover the same 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:03:00.299
 glass of the same white color 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:03:01.680
 note the quality is good but 

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:11.760
 local feature 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:13.940
 She double-sided adhesive tape is there but 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.440
 no one has 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:19.320
 external part which is responsible for 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:21.840
 antenna that is if we see here 

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:26.970
 these back covers then this one 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:35.040
 we also need to unsolder or not even 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:36.650
 concepts warm and rip off stick 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:40.109
 here in principle 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:43.709
 the difficulty lies only in this 

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:45.920
 also we heat it off and seal it 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:45.920
 here 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:04:01.350
 so warming up simon here this part and 

00:03:54.240 --> 00:04:01.350
 try to remove it neatly 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:15.030
 In general, neatly we hook while she 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:15.030
 hot and 

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:37.230
 peel off right there we need to glue so 

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:37.230
 look where was 

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:19.790
 is it possible to return 

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:38.600
 remove layer 

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:51.720
 release double-sided tape and try 

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:55.590
 stick the main thing here to close 

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:58.880
 close to the antenna and an external antenna at 

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:58.880
 then you worked 

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:16.840
 Serve into the grooves and press the lid tightly 

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:26.600
 also after we find out if it works 

00:06:23.479 --> 00:06:28.600
 the network can be heated again and 

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:33.340
 press well 

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:33.340
 in order to avoid trouble 

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:42.460
 doing a launch 

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:45.889
 sim card views running hang 

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:48.830
 as I said, do not forget again about 

00:06:45.889 --> 00:06:51.680
 glue is good because maybe even 

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:56.380
 this scotch will not be enough 

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:56.380
 make another layer glue well 

00:06:56.500 --> 00:07:09.280
 so you see dangling now we look 

00:07:03.919 --> 00:07:09.280
 network and glue 

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:41.060
 as we see the network is everything is fine to everyone 

00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:43.580
 thank you subscribe to my channel 

00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:46.690
