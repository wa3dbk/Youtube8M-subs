me<00:02:01.120> feel<00:02:01.150> then<00:02:01.900> d<00:02:02.080> I<00:02:02.260> love<00:02:02.890> it<00:02:03.280> and<00:02:03.790> then<00:02:03.970> a

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:04.120 
me feel then d I love it and then a

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:06.900 
me feel then d I love it and then a
minor<00:02:04.360> I<00:02:05.040> that's<00:02:06.040> two<00:02:06.310> lines<00:02:06.550> you're<00:02:06.760> just

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:06.910 
minor I that's two lines you're just

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:10.440 
minor I that's two lines you're just
playing<00:02:07.120> two<00:02:07.420> courts<00:02:08.130> every<00:02:09.130> line<00:02:09.340> and<00:02:10.240> then

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
playing two courts every line and then

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:12.000 
playing two courts every line and then
that<00:02:10.570> makes<00:02:10.720> four<00:02:10.960> in<00:02:11.050> total<00:02:11.200> and<00:02:11.560> then

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010 
that makes four in total and then

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:14.220 
that makes four in total and then
obviously<00:02:12.430> there's<00:02:12.880> the<00:02:12.940> course<00:02:13.300> outside

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
obviously there's the course outside

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:17.190 
obviously there's the course outside
versus<00:02:14.770> so<00:02:15.070> it's<00:02:15.220> just<00:02:15.400> on<00:02:16.120> a<00:02:16.180> scale<00:02:16.630> of<00:02:16.810> one<00:02:17.170> to

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
versus so it's just on a scale of one to

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:28.650 
versus so it's just on a scale of one to
ten<00:02:21.180> that<00:02:22.180> sort<00:02:22.480> of<00:02:22.540> structure<00:02:27.390> does<00:02:28.390> it<00:02:28.540> say
