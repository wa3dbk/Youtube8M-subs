00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.210
 Hi, people, I'm going to decorate today. 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:18.779
 and a mdf portrait port using cds 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:21.420
 old the materials 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:27.750
 I'll take an hour a picture of 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:33.660
 mdf old cds that are already winning 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:36.329
 Do not you use more black ink 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:39.570
 I used the spray paint but you can 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:46.050
 use normal acrylic paint the brush or 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:48.570
 then the white glue paint and scissors 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:52.320
 I already tried the mdf portrait port of 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:54.899
 black with a spray paint is and now I 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:58.980
 I'll get the cd and I'll cut it with the 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:01.550
 you scissors its hard to cut 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:04.530
 So you have to do some strength. 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:07.320
 but you can only cut with scissors too 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:11.299
 in the stiletto I already tried it is difficult is 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.299
 even more difficult than with scissors 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:25.170
 there's a little tip here, just come here 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:27.540
 hit it will stay this way 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:31.049
 so here I already cut several pieces 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:33.540
 cd I used a cd and a half for this 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.710
 portrait and now just paste with the 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.049
 White glue 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:40.799
 if you want before you paste the 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:43.350
 can come here and put 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:46.500
 see the disposition that they will stay 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:48.829
 before pasting that and then does not 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.829
 error 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:02:01.300
 I already put the cd the way I 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:04.080
 I want you to be in the picture frame and now 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:04.080
 I'm just going to paste 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.010
 so folks went that way they got off 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:31.740
 tract 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:34.050
 anyone who wants can find these materials 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:36.840

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:46.050
