then<00:00:01.469> I<00:00:01.589> want<00:00:01.770> to<00:00:01.890> show<00:00:02.070> you<00:00:02.129> how<00:00:02.370> to<00:00:02.429> test<00:00:02.760> for

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:02.970 
then I want to show you how to test for

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:05.269 
then I want to show you how to test for
fake<00:00:03.179> gold<00:00:03.540> or<00:00:03.810> silver<00:00:03.959> coins<00:00:04.410> using<00:00:05.190> a

00:00:05.269 --> 00:00:05.279 
fake gold or silver coins using a

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:08.690 
fake gold or silver coins using a
powerful<00:00:05.640> 10<00:00:06.120> millimeter<00:00:07.700> neodymium

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
powerful 10 millimeter neodymium

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.690 
powerful 10 millimeter neodymium
rare-earth<00:00:09.210> magnet<00:00:09.740> the<00:00:10.740> test<00:00:11.010> is<00:00:11.219> based<00:00:11.460> on

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
rare-earth magnet the test is based on

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.370 
rare-earth magnet the test is based on
the<00:00:11.820> fact<00:00:12.059> that<00:00:12.269> gold<00:00:12.450> and<00:00:12.599> silver<00:00:13.049> are<00:00:13.200> both

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
the fact that gold and silver are both

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.079 
the fact that gold and silver are both
non-magnetic<00:00:14.309> metals

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
non-magnetic metals

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:16.970 
non-magnetic metals
however<00:00:15.929> when<00:00:16.320> brought<00:00:16.529> into<00:00:16.859> close

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
however when brought into close

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.189 
however when brought into close
proximity<00:00:17.520> with<00:00:17.910> the<00:00:18.029> strong<00:00:18.330> magnetic<00:00:18.900> force

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
proximity with the strong magnetic force

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.830 
proximity with the strong magnetic force
the<00:00:20.010> effect<00:00:20.340> on<00:00:20.580> the<00:00:20.730> electrons<00:00:21.210> that<00:00:21.420> make<00:00:21.600> up

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
the effect on the electrons that make up

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.500 
the effect on the electrons that make up
both<00:00:22.050> gold<00:00:22.350> and<00:00:22.500> silver<00:00:22.980> as<00:00:23.160> the<00:00:23.850> effect<00:00:24.240> of

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
both gold and silver as the effect of

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.460 
both gold and silver as the effect of
making<00:00:24.660> the<00:00:25.019> metals<00:00:25.380> very<00:00:25.680> slightly<00:00:26.070> magnetic

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:27.470 
making the metals very slightly magnetic

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:29.990 
making the metals very slightly magnetic
so<00:00:28.470> if<00:00:28.560> the<00:00:28.680> metal<00:00:28.980> is<00:00:29.099> not<00:00:29.250> affected<00:00:29.789> by<00:00:29.820> the

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
so if the metal is not affected by the

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.420 
so if the metal is not affected by the
magnet<00:00:30.510> the<00:00:31.109> magnet<00:00:31.500> will<00:00:31.740> quickly<00:00:32.160> slide

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
magnet the magnet will quickly slide

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.790 
magnet the magnet will quickly slide
straight<00:00:32.759> off<00:00:33.059> the<00:00:33.210> coin<00:00:33.450> proving<00:00:34.290> it<00:00:34.410> to<00:00:34.590> be<00:00:34.770> a

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
straight off the coin proving it to be a

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.540 
straight off the coin proving it to be a
fake<00:00:35.160> gold<00:00:36.059> or<00:00:36.360> silver<00:00:36.600> coin<00:00:37.340> similarly<00:00:38.340> if

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
fake gold or silver coin similarly if

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.910 
fake gold or silver coin similarly if
the<00:00:38.730> magnet<00:00:39.090> sticks<00:00:39.390> to<00:00:39.570> the<00:00:39.690> coin<00:00:39.930> and<00:00:40.770> the

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
the magnet sticks to the coin and the

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.369 
the magnet sticks to the coin and the
coin<00:00:41.129> material<00:00:41.790> is<00:00:41.940> magnetic<00:00:42.600> and<00:00:42.960> the<00:00:43.170> coin

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
coin material is magnetic and the coin

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.940 
coin material is magnetic and the coin
is<00:00:43.649> a<00:00:43.680> fake<00:00:44.690> if<00:00:45.690> however<00:00:45.899> the<00:00:46.260> material<00:00:46.379> is

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
is a fake if however the material is

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.340 
is a fake if however the material is
real<00:00:47.190> gold<00:00:47.520> or<00:00:47.700> silver<00:00:47.969> it<00:00:48.660> will<00:00:48.780> be<00:00:48.899> slightly

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
real gold or silver it will be slightly

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.529 
real gold or silver it will be slightly
affected<00:00:49.800> by<00:00:50.010> the<00:00:50.070> strong<00:00:50.489> magnetic<00:00:50.879> force<00:00:51.300> of

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
affected by the strong magnetic force of

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.900 
affected by the strong magnetic force of
the<00:00:51.660> magnet<00:00:51.860> so<00:00:52.860> the<00:00:53.010> magnet<00:00:53.399> will<00:00:53.640> glide

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
the magnet so the magnet will glide

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.090 
the magnet so the magnet will glide
slowly<00:00:54.300> down<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:54.809> coin<00:00:55.020> being<00:00:55.739> slowed<00:00:56.070> down

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
slowly down the coin being slowed down

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.939 
slowly down the coin being slowed down
by<00:00:56.730> the<00:00:56.789> slight<00:00:57.210> magnetic<00:00:57.840> effect<00:00:58.260> that<00:00:58.800> the

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
by the slight magnetic effect that the

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.279 
by the slight magnetic effect that the
magnet<00:00:59.309> ours<00:00:59.550> on<00:00:59.820> the<00:01:00.329> coins<00:01:00.690> electron

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
magnet ours on the coins electron

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.219 
magnet ours on the coins electron
structure<00:01:02.210> so<00:01:03.210> let's<00:01:03.239> try<00:01:03.629> the<00:01:03.690> test<00:01:03.989> with

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
structure so let's try the test with

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.890 
structure so let's try the test with
these<00:01:04.409> coins<00:01:04.739> on<00:01:04.920> the<00:01:04.949> table<00:01:06.110> first<00:01:07.110> one<00:01:07.409> is<00:01:08.159> a

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:08.900 
these coins on the table first one is a

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.710 
these coins on the table first one is a
925<00:01:09.900> British<00:01:10.680> crown<00:01:11.040> it<00:01:11.760> should<00:01:12.030> be<00:01:12.180> sterling

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
925 British crown it should be sterling

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.630 
925 British crown it should be sterling
silver<00:01:13.200> so<00:01:14.159> if<00:01:14.490> we<00:01:15.119> tilt<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:15.420> coin<00:01:15.830> at<00:01:16.830> a<00:01:16.890> 45

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
silver so if we tilt the coin at a 45

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.210 
silver so if we tilt the coin at a 45
degree<00:01:17.670> angle<00:01:17.909> and<00:01:18.530> place<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:19.770> magnets<00:01:20.100> at

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
degree angle and place the magnets at

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.749 
degree angle and place the magnets at
the<00:01:20.310> top<00:01:20.549> and<00:01:20.820> let<00:01:20.970> go<00:01:21.979> the<00:01:22.979> magnet<00:01:23.400> slides

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
the top and let go the magnet slides

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.330 
the top and let go the magnet slides
straight<00:01:23.970> off<00:01:24.299> the<00:01:24.479> coin<00:01:24.830> there's<00:01:25.830> no<00:01:26.009> effect

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
straight off the coin there's no effect

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.539 
straight off the coin there's no effect
at<00:01:26.490> all<00:01:27.080> so<00:01:28.080> we<00:01:28.200> can<00:01:28.350> therefore<00:01:28.560> so<00:01:28.950> that<00:01:29.280> coin

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
at all so we can therefore so that coin

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:34.940 
at all so we can therefore so that coin
is<00:01:29.850> definitely<00:01:30.360> a<00:01:30.509> fake<00:01:32.900> the<00:01:33.900> next<00:01:34.200> coin<00:01:34.439> is

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
is definitely a fake the next coin is

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.590 
is definitely a fake the next coin is
also<00:01:35.130> a<00:01:35.670> British<00:01:35.970> crown

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
also a British crown

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.260 
also a British crown
it's<00:01:36.720> pre-1920<00:01:37.619> show<00:01:38.310> it<00:01:38.460> so<00:01:38.640> it<00:01:38.700> should<00:01:38.970> again

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
it's pre-1920 show it so it should again

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.100 
it's pre-1920 show it so it should again
be<00:01:39.299> 925<00:01:40.259> silver<00:01:40.579> which<00:01:41.579> is<00:01:41.610> 95<00:01:42.509> point<00:01:42.899> 2

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
be 925 silver which is 95 point 2

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.340 
be 925 silver which is 95 point 2
percent<00:01:43.320> pure<00:01:44.220> silver

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.350 
percent pure silver

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:47.350 
percent pure silver
so<00:01:45.680> again<00:01:45.980> we<00:01:46.220> put<00:01:46.370> the<00:01:46.490> magnet<00:01:46.820> at<00:01:46.940> the<00:01:47.030> top<00:01:47.240> of

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:47.360 
so again we put the magnet at the top of

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:51.160 
so again we put the magnet at the top of
the<00:01:47.479> coin<00:01:47.780> and<00:01:48.200> let<00:01:48.470> go<00:01:49.630> this<00:01:50.630> time<00:01:50.870> the

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:51.170 
the coin and let go this time the

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:52.870 
the coin and let go this time the
magnets<00:01:51.530> is<00:01:51.650> sticking<00:01:52.040> to<00:01:52.070> the<00:01:52.190> coin<00:01:52.520> which

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:52.880 
magnets is sticking to the coin which

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:54.850 
magnets is sticking to the coin which
proves<00:01:53.150> that<00:01:53.270> the<00:01:53.450> material<00:01:54.229> that<00:01:54.350> the<00:01:54.560> coin

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:54.860 
proves that the material that the coin

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:57.790 
proves that the material that the coin
is<00:01:54.890> made<00:01:55.250> of<00:01:55.520> is<00:01:55.760> magnetic<00:01:56.300> so<00:01:56.570> the<00:01:57.229> coin<00:01:57.470> is

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:57.800 
is made of is magnetic so the coin is

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:03.219 
is made of is magnetic so the coin is
definitely<00:01:58.280> not<00:01:58.400> silver<00:01:58.940> and<00:01:59.119> is<00:01:59.540> a<00:01:59.570> fake<00:02:02.229> next

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:03.229 
definitely not silver and is a fake next

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:07.300 
definitely not silver and is a fake next
up<00:02:03.380> is<00:02:03.560> the<00:02:03.850> five-pound<00:02:04.850> gold<00:02:05.119> piece<00:02:06.040> again<00:02:07.040> we

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:07.310 
up is the five-pound gold piece again we

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.300 
up is the five-pound gold piece again we
put<00:02:07.490> the<00:02:07.580> magnets<00:02:07.910> at<00:02:08.000> the<00:02:08.119> top<00:02:08.800> and<00:02:09.800> let<00:02:09.950> it<00:02:09.979> go

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
put the magnets at the top and let it go

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:12.370 
put the magnets at the top and let it go
and<00:02:10.820> it<00:02:11.150> slides<00:02:11.420> straight<00:02:11.810> down<00:02:11.990> the<00:02:12.140> coin

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
and it slides straight down the coin

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:16.360 
and it slides straight down the coin
again<00:02:12.880> proving<00:02:13.880> that<00:02:14.120> it's<00:02:14.420> a<00:02:14.540> fake<00:02:15.310> now<00:02:16.310> we

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
again proving that it's a fake now we

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:19.620 
again proving that it's a fake now we
come<00:02:16.700> to<00:02:16.730> the<00:02:16.910> real<00:02:17.060> silver<00:02:17.920> this<00:02:18.920> is<00:02:19.100> pre<00:02:19.310> nine

three nineteen twenty crown which again
is<00:02:22.970> ninety<00:02:23.300> two<00:02:23.390> five<00:02:23.720> silver<00:02:24.220> and<00:02:25.220> this<00:02:25.430> time

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
is ninety two five silver and this time

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:27.130 
is ninety two five silver and this time
it<00:02:25.850> put<00:02:26.000> the<00:02:26.120> magnets<00:02:26.450> at<00:02:26.570> the<00:02:26.660> top<00:02:26.900> of<00:02:27.050> the

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
it put the magnets at the top of the

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:31.090 
it put the magnets at the top of the
coin<00:02:27.440> and<00:02:27.770> let<00:02:27.950> it<00:02:28.070> go<00:02:28.280> and<00:02:29.200> the<00:02:30.200> magnet<00:02:30.620> slowly

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:31.100 
coin and let it go and the magnet slowly

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:34.090 
coin and let it go and the magnet slowly
glides<00:02:31.580> down<00:02:31.730> the<00:02:32.060> coin<00:02:32.410> due<00:02:33.410> to<00:02:33.590> the<00:02:33.709> effect

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:34.100 
glides down the coin due to the effect

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:36.460 
glides down the coin due to the effect
that<00:02:34.250> the<00:02:34.550> magnet<00:02:35.270> as<00:02:35.450> on<00:02:35.750> the<00:02:35.959> electrons

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
that the magnet as on the electrons

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:41.970 
that the magnet as on the electrons
within<00:02:36.800> the<00:02:36.920> silver

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:46.320 

and<00:02:42.550> lastly<00:02:42.910> we<00:02:43.150> have<00:02:43.319> an<00:02:44.370> American<00:02:45.370> Silver

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:51.580 
these are $9.99 purity which means they

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:55.830 
these are $9.99 purity which means they
are<00:02:51.870> 99.9%<00:02:52.870> pure<00:02:53.560> silver<00:02:53.879> so<00:02:54.879> again<00:02:55.239> we'll<00:02:55.660> put

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
are 99.9% pure silver so again we'll put

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.520 
are 99.9% pure silver so again we'll put
the<00:02:55.959> magnet<00:02:56.670> on<00:02:57.670> the<00:02:57.849> top<00:02:58.060> of<00:02:58.209> the<00:02:58.330> coin<00:02:58.569> and

the magnet on the top of the coin and
let<00:02:59.830> go<00:03:00.010> and<00:03:01.110> again<00:03:02.110> he<00:03:02.290> gently<00:03:02.709> slides<00:03:03.280> down

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:03.550 
let go and again he gently slides down

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:06.030 
let go and again he gently slides down
the<00:03:03.700> coin<00:03:03.910> this<00:03:04.599> time<00:03:04.870> a<00:03:04.900> bit<00:03:05.230> a<00:03:05.410> bit<00:03:05.680> slower

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
the coin this time a bit a bit slower

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.339 
the coin this time a bit a bit slower
than<00:03:06.310> the<00:03:06.370> crown<00:03:06.670> because<00:03:07.150> the<00:03:07.450> purity<00:03:07.930> in<00:03:08.110> the

00:03:08.339 --> 00:03:08.349 
than the crown because the purity in the

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:11.490 
than the crown because the purity in the
in<00:03:08.650> the<00:03:09.220> Silver<00:03:09.610> Eagle<00:03:09.970> is<00:03:10.120> a<00:03:10.750> lot<00:03:10.959> more<00:03:11.140> pure

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500 
in the Silver Eagle is a lot more pure

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.970 
in the Silver Eagle is a lot more pure
than<00:03:11.980> it<00:03:12.400> note<00:03:12.700> and<00:03:12.879> that's<00:03:13.330> in<00:03:13.540> the<00:03:13.660> crown<00:03:13.980> so

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:14.980 
than it note and that's in the crown so

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:16.500 
than it note and that's in the crown so
that's<00:03:15.220> the<00:03:15.400> effect<00:03:15.700> that<00:03:15.760> you<00:03:15.940> need<00:03:16.180> to<00:03:16.299> get

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
that's the effect that you need to get

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:19.920 
that's the effect that you need to get
on<00:03:16.720> your<00:03:16.900> gold<00:03:17.170> and<00:03:17.290> silver<00:03:17.650> coins
