via firmware update and that's because

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.420 
via firmware update and that's because
we<00:03:01.390> do<00:03:01.600> have<00:03:01.810> the<00:03:01.990> chip<00:03:02.290> of<00:03:02.440> the<00:03:02.560> wireless<00:03:02.980> and

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
we do have the chip of the wireless and

we do have the chip of the wireless and
Wi-Fi<00:03:04.620> Apple<00:03:05.620> just<00:03:05.770> hasn't<00:03:06.070> enabled<00:03:06.700> it<00:03:06.790> yet

Wi-Fi Apple just hasn't enabled it yet
in<00:03:07.180> the<00:03:07.360> software<00:03:07.870> so<00:03:08.110> we'll<00:03:08.380> have<00:03:08.560> to<00:03:08.740> look

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:08.770 
in the software so we'll have to look

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:11.370 
in the software so we'll have to look
forward<00:03:09.130> to<00:03:09.280> that<00:03:09.310> later<00:03:09.810> but<00:03:10.810> that's<00:03:10.990> really

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:11.380 
forward to that later but that's really

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:16.840 
forward to that later but that's really
it<00:03:11.590> for<00:03:11.830> the<00:03:11.920> design

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:16.850 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:20.870 

so<00:03:17.990> performance<00:03:18.990> wise<00:03:19.260> the<00:03:19.740> 8<00:03:20.160> gigabyte

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
so performance wise the 8 gigabyte

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:22.880 
so performance wise the 8 gigabyte

comparison to the last generation iPod

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:30.260 
comparison to the last generation iPod
Touch<00:03:26.720> is<00:03:27.720> pretty<00:03:28.170> much<00:03:28.380> the<00:03:28.710> same<00:03:29.270> you'll

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:30.270 
Touch is pretty much the same you'll

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:32.870 
Touch is pretty much the same you'll
notice<00:03:30.690> that<00:03:30.930> you<00:03:31.470> know<00:03:31.640> pretty<00:03:32.640> much<00:03:32.730> the

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 
notice that you know pretty much the

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.880 
notice that you know pretty much the
same<00:03:33.120> speed<00:03:33.450> across<00:03:33.720> the<00:03:33.990> board<00:03:34.260> maybe<00:03:34.530> a

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
same speed across the board maybe a

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:38.330 
same speed across the board maybe a
little<00:03:35.370> bit<00:03:35.640> snappier<00:03:37.160> navigating<00:03:38.160> through

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
little bit snappier navigating through

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:41.240 
little bit snappier navigating through
menus<00:03:38.820> and<00:03:39.090> apps<00:03:39.390> and<00:03:39.750> loading<00:03:40.620> times<00:03:40.890> maybe

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
menus and apps and loading times maybe

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:44.210 
menus and apps and loading times maybe
faster<00:03:41.630> but<00:03:42.630> again<00:03:43.260> not<00:03:43.740> much<00:03:44.010> of<00:03:44.130> a

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
faster but again not much of a

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.370 
faster but again not much of a
noticeable<00:03:44.670> difference<00:03:44.820> here<00:03:45.390> and<00:03:45.540> I<00:03:46.050> think

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.380 
noticeable difference here and I think

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:51.260 
noticeable difference here and I think
that<00:03:46.680> the<00:03:47.040> $1.99<00:03:48.030> a<00:03:48.510> price<00:03:49.440> point<00:03:50.090> with<00:03:51.090> this

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:51.270 
that the $1.99 a price point with this

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:53.120 
that the $1.99 a price point with this
price<00:03:51.570> is<00:03:51.840> pretty<00:03:52.020> much<00:03:52.260> it's<00:03:52.500> worth<00:03:52.560> it<00:03:52.980> I

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:53.130 
price is pretty much it's worth it I

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:55.160 
price is pretty much it's worth it I
really<00:03:54.060> personally<00:03:54.270> don't<00:03:54.600> care<00:03:54.690> about<00:03:54.930> speed

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:55.170 
really personally don't care about speed

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:57.229 
really personally don't care about speed
because<00:03:55.620> I<00:03:55.890> know<00:03:56.370> that<00:03:56.640> everything<00:03:57.030> on<00:03:57.090> the

00:03:57.229 --> 00:03:57.239 
because I know that everything on the

00:03:57.239 --> 00:03:58.400 
because I know that everything on the
App<00:03:57.360> Store<00:03:57.390> will<00:03:57.840> be<00:03:57.930> backwards<00:03:58.380> compatible

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:58.410 
App Store will be backwards compatible

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:03.680 
App Store will be backwards compatible
to<00:03:59.130> each<00:03:59.459> I<00:03:59.940> phone<00:04:00.540> and<00:04:00.980> iPod<00:04:01.980> Touch<00:04:02.600> for<00:04:03.600> the

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:03.690 
to each I phone and iPod Touch for the

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:07.180 
to each I phone and iPod Touch for the
most<00:04:03.900> part<00:04:04.290> so<00:04:04.709> I'm<00:04:05.010> not<00:04:05.280> that<00:04:05.610> worried<00:04:06.209> about

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:07.190 
most part so I'm not that worried about

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:10.729 
most part so I'm not that worried about
compatibility<00:04:08.190> at<00:04:08.760> this<00:04:09.000> point<00:04:09.530> so<00:04:10.530> yeah

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:10.739 
compatibility at this point so yeah

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:14.449 
compatibility at this point so yeah
speed<00:04:11.310> definitely<00:04:12.150> not<00:04:12.360> an<00:04:12.540> issue<00:04:13.130> but<00:04:14.130> if<00:04:14.310> you

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:14.459 
speed definitely not an issue but if you

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:16.460 
speed definitely not an issue but if you
are<00:04:14.730> a<00:04:14.760> speed<00:04:15.209> demon<00:04:15.390> you<00:04:15.750> want<00:04:15.930> to<00:04:16.019> go<00:04:16.140> play

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:16.470 
are a speed demon you want to go play

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:18.949 
are a speed demon you want to go play
some<00:04:16.500> graphic<00:04:17.190> intense<00:04:17.489> games<00:04:17.820> go<00:04:18.540> ahead<00:04:18.810> and

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:18.959 
some graphic intense games go ahead and

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:20.780 
some graphic intense games go ahead and
grab<00:04:19.109> the<00:04:19.230> 32<00:04:19.680> gig<00:04:19.980> because<00:04:20.130> you<00:04:20.340> may<00:04:20.489> need<00:04:20.640> the

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:20.790 
grab the 32 gig because you may need the

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:23.000 
grab the 32 gig because you may need the
space<00:04:21.060> for<00:04:21.120> those<00:04:21.540> graphic<00:04:22.260> attends<00:04:22.590> games<00:04:22.830> as

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:23.010 
space for those graphic attends games as

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:26.090 
space for those graphic attends games as
well<00:04:23.190> but<00:04:23.660> not<00:04:24.660> much<00:04:24.870> again<00:04:25.320> of<00:04:25.560> the<00:04:25.680> speed

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:26.100 
well but not much again of the speed

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:28.969 
well but not much again of the speed
difference<00:04:26.490> between<00:04:27.030> this<00:04:27.750> and<00:04:28.080> the<00:04:28.620> second

00:04:28.969 --> 00:04:28.979 
difference between this and the second

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:32.420 
difference between this and the second
generation<00:04:29.280> iPod<00:04:29.729> Touch<00:04:30.020> so<00:04:31.020> yeah<00:04:31.830> keep<00:04:32.190> that

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:32.430 
generation iPod Touch so yeah keep that

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:35.840 
generation iPod Touch so yeah keep that
in<00:04:32.669> mind<00:04:33.030> if<00:04:33.360> you<00:04:33.600> are<00:04:33.900> for<00:04:34.320> speed<00:04:34.680> but<00:04:35.010> on<00:04:35.220> one

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:35.850 
in mind if you are for speed but on one

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:38.540 
in mind if you are for speed but on one
thing<00:04:36.180> before<00:04:36.479> I<00:04:36.750> wrap<00:04:37.229> up<00:04:37.550> performance

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:38.550 
thing before I wrap up performance

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:41.570 
thing before I wrap up performance
you'll<00:04:38.729> notice<00:04:39.120> that<00:04:39.650> the<00:04:40.650> accelerometer

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:41.580 
you'll notice that the accelerometer

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:43.010 
you'll notice that the accelerometer
definitely<00:04:42.090> works<00:04:42.300> faster<00:04:42.780> in<00:04:42.870> this

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:43.020 
definitely works faster in this

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:44.990 
definitely works faster in this
generation<00:04:43.620> it<00:04:43.740> definitely<00:04:44.100> works<00:04:44.460> with<00:04:44.790> in

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:45.000 
generation it definitely works with in

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.840 
generation it definitely works with in
the<00:04:45.150> second<00:04:45.630> rather<00:04:46.200> than<00:04:46.590> within<00:04:47.130> one<00:04:47.490> or<00:04:47.610> two

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:47.850 
the second rather than within one or two

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:49.670 
the second rather than within one or two
seconds<00:04:48.270> more<00:04:48.540> and<00:04:48.840> I<00:04:49.260> know<00:04:49.320> that<00:04:49.530> doesn't

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:49.680 
seconds more and I know that doesn't

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:51.710 
seconds more and I know that doesn't
seem<00:04:49.890> like<00:04:50.100> a<00:04:50.130> lot<00:04:50.370> of<00:04:50.400> time<00:04:50.760> but<00:04:51.120> I<00:04:51.180> mean<00:04:51.450> it<00:04:51.570> is

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:51.720 
seem like a lot of time but I mean it is

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:55.090 
seem like a lot of time but I mean it is
somewhat<00:04:52.200> of<00:04:52.410> an<00:04:53.210> enhancement<00:04:54.210> if<00:04:54.600> you<00:04:54.720> will

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:55.100 
somewhat of an enhancement if you will

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:57.560 
somewhat of an enhancement if you will
as<00:04:56.100> you<00:04:56.220> can<00:04:56.340> see<00:04:56.520> it<00:04:56.610> literally<00:04:56.820> just<00:04:57.090> changes

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:57.570 
as you can see it literally just changes

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:59.300 
as you can see it literally just changes
and<00:04:57.720> that<00:04:57.810> is<00:04:57.990> Engadget<00:04:58.590> said<00:04:58.770> graphically

00:04:59.300 --> 00:04:59.310 
and that is Engadget said graphically

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:01.580 
and that is Engadget said graphically
intense<00:04:59.640> sight<00:04:59.990> compared<00:05:00.990> to<00:05:01.080> like<00:05:01.200> Google<00:05:01.500> or

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:01.590 
intense sight compared to like Google or

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:03.980 
intense sight compared to like Google or
something<00:05:01.830> and<00:05:02.190> it<00:05:02.729> literally<00:05:03.060> just<00:05:03.210> changes

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:03.990 
something and it literally just changes

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:06.770 
something and it literally just changes
on<00:05:04.169> the<00:05:04.440> second<00:05:04.860> so<00:05:05.120> great<00:05:06.120> job<00:05:06.330> on<00:05:06.450> Apple's

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:06.780 
on the second so great job on Apple's

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:09.320 
on the second so great job on Apple's
part<00:05:07.110> and<00:05:07.380> I<00:05:08.340> really<00:05:08.880> think<00:05:09.030> that<00:05:09.150> they<00:05:09.300> tried

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:09.330 
part and I really think that they tried

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:11.240 
part and I really think that they tried
to<00:05:09.690> tweak<00:05:10.020> this<00:05:10.169> as<00:05:10.320> much<00:05:10.470> as<00:05:10.590> possible<00:05:10.740> to<00:05:11.100> get

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:11.250 
to tweak this as much as possible to get

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:14.480 
to tweak this as much as possible to get
the<00:05:12.240> most<00:05:12.410> experience<00:05:13.410> and<00:05:13.710> the<00:05:13.830> most<00:05:14.010> speed

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:14.490 
the most experience and the most speed

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:17.990 
the most experience and the most speed
for<00:05:15.169> people<00:05:16.169> that<00:05:16.290> buy<00:05:16.500> this<00:05:16.800> so<00:05:17.070> uh<00:05:17.100> that's<00:05:17.850> a

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:18.000 
for people that buy this so uh that's a

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:24.770 
for people that buy this so uh that's a
really<00:05:18.210> good<00:05:18.330> job<00:05:18.540> on<00:05:18.780> Apple's<00:05:19.560> part

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:24.780 

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:28.020 

see<00:05:25.780> overall<00:05:26.170> this<00:05:26.470> iPod<00:05:26.920> is<00:05:27.130> pretty<00:05:27.430> nice<00:05:27.670> I

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:28.030 
see overall this iPod is pretty nice I

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:29.460 
see overall this iPod is pretty nice I
mean<00:05:28.210> you're<00:05:28.420> not<00:05:28.510> going<00:05:28.660> to<00:05:28.750> get<00:05:28.840> the<00:05:29.020> speed

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:29.470 
mean you're not going to get the speed

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:32.340 
mean you're not going to get the speed
that<00:05:29.800> the<00:05:29.980> higher<00:05:30.280> tiers<00:05:30.730> get<00:05:31.120> but<00:05:31.900> overall

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:32.350 
that the higher tiers get but overall

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:35.730 
that the higher tiers get but overall
it's<00:05:32.680> still<00:05:32.770> a<00:05:33.130> pretty<00:05:33.550> fast<00:05:34.090> device<00:05:34.660> um<00:05:35.050> it'll

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:35.740 
it's still a pretty fast device um it'll

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:37.980 
it's still a pretty fast device um it'll
play<00:05:36.040> pretty<00:05:36.400> much<00:05:36.670> everything<00:05:37.510> that<00:05:37.540> is<00:05:37.810> on

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:37.990 
play pretty much everything that is on

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:41.480 
play pretty much everything that is on
the<00:05:38.320> App<00:05:38.470> Store<00:05:38.500> that<00:05:38.890> is<00:05:39.460> not<00:05:40.060> only<00:05:40.360> iPhone

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:41.490 
the App Store that is not only iPhone

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:44.250 
the App Store that is not only iPhone
compatible<00:05:42.490> and<00:05:42.670> I<00:05:43.150> mean<00:05:43.480> it<00:05:43.690> is<00:05:43.840> fast<00:05:44.110> enough

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:44.260 
compatible and I mean it is fast enough

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:47.190 
compatible and I mean it is fast enough
to<00:05:44.530> pretty<00:05:44.740> much<00:05:44.950> play<00:05:45.550> every<00:05:46.270> game<00:05:46.300> and<00:05:46.810> I<00:05:46.870> and

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:47.200 
to pretty much play every game and I and

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:49.380 
to pretty much play every game and I and
I<00:05:47.650> don't<00:05:47.710> mean<00:05:48.040> that<00:05:48.100> it's<00:05:48.430> on<00:05:48.580> the<00:05:48.850> borderline

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:49.390 
I don't mean that it's on the borderline

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:50.850 
I don't mean that it's on the borderline
of<00:05:49.600> playing<00:05:49.870> any<00:05:50.080> of<00:05:50.200> those<00:05:50.290> games

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:50.860 
of playing any of those games

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:52.320 
of playing any of those games
it<00:05:50.950> is<00:05:51.070> literally<00:05:51.400> fast<00:05:51.760> enough<00:05:52.030> to<00:05:52.150> play

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:52.330 
it is literally fast enough to play

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:55.320 
it is literally fast enough to play
those<00:05:52.510> games<00:05:52.540> with<00:05:53.170> efficiency<00:05:53.950> and<00:05:54.210> you<00:05:55.210> know

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:55.330 
those games with efficiency and you know

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:58.230 
those games with efficiency and you know
without<00:05:55.660> any<00:05:55.900> noticeable<00:05:56.440> trouble<00:05:57.130> but<00:05:58.090> you

00:05:58.230 --> 00:05:58.240 
without any noticeable trouble but you

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:01.380 
without any noticeable trouble but you
know<00:05:58.360> what<00:05:58.570> really<00:05:59.470> compared<00:06:00.100> to<00:06:00.340> the<00:06:00.640> 32<00:06:01.240> and

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:01.390 
know what really compared to the 32 and

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:03.930 
know what really compared to the 32 and
a<00:06:01.420> 64<00:06:01.990> gig<00:06:02.230> you<00:06:02.440> will<00:06:02.590> notice<00:06:02.950> differences<00:06:03.640> but

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:03.940 
a 64 gig you will notice differences but

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:06.630 
a 64 gig you will notice differences but
I<00:06:04.180> mean<00:06:04.750> for<00:06:05.020> the<00:06:05.110> $1.99<00:06:05.560> price<00:06:06.010> point<00:06:06.400> you

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:06.640 
I mean for the $1.99 price point you

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:09.510 
I mean for the $1.99 price point you
really<00:06:07.000> can't<00:06:07.270> go<00:06:07.480> wrong<00:06:08.190> see<00:06:09.190> I<00:06:09.280> like<00:06:09.490> to
