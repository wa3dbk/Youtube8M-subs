00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:09.380
 welcome to hiphop production my name 

00:00:07.549 --> 00:00:10.519
 it's soma I know that in this time it's been 

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:12.469
 the open block 

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:14.030
 we've talked about pretty concepts 

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:15.889
 dense especially for people who are 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:17.570
 starting but good you know I give it 

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:19.520
 importance to have a foundation and a 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:21.590
 solid base however today I have 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:23.120
 decided to show you something a little more 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:24.710
 soft more entertaining 

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:26.390
 let's see how to create the effect of the 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:28.040
 vinyl stop that in addition to the 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:29.510
 hip hop producers always comes to us 

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:31.070
 fucking mother because if we have to 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:32.360
 our provision the right equipment 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:34.340
 we can do it without any problem 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:36.950
 but if we do not have it and it is likely that 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:38.840
 do not have it because it is a very good 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:40.550
 way and good with the nonsense you're going to 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:42.200
 learn a couple of things about 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:44.660
 the envelopes that are very important 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:47.630
 also to manipulate the sound we go down 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:49.760
 to know above but the basic idea 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:51.500
 is going to stay there we have two ways of 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:54.530
 get this effect I have divided them 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:56.120
 rather in two ways one is without going 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:58.489
 to the tempo that is the one that we're going to start 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.840
 watching me bringing the tempo without going to the 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:02.149
 tempo means the following if you 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:04.430
 you have a phrase spoken on the vinyl and 

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:05.859
 you press the stop the spoken phrase goes to 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:09.530
 start down 

00:01:05.859 --> 00:01:11.479
 shift and speed will not only go down 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:13.789
 tone will also slow down 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:17.469
 tempo and that's the one we're going to first 

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:23.230
 recreate for it I'm going to catch a club 

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:26.580
 out dollars read kit tempo 90 

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:30.030
 active we are not going for here 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:35.450
 and I copy a second look so that 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:37.740
 compass 6 and compass 7 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.660
 perfect we want the compass 7 before 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.460
 to re-enter the look again be 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:43.260
 the one that has the effect so what 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.680
 dragged to a new track and with the 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:49.500
 selected part I'm going to audio 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:51.450
 pitch correction process if you have it 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.180
 in English it is possible that it is called pitch 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.680
 shift and depending on the version of 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.360
 cubase or your version 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.100
 sequencer will have a name u 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.870
 another but always very similar and 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.060
 it will surely open by default in 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:05.460
 transposition is something we do not want 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.680
 we are going to surround and also by 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:10.229
 defect this will surely open up in a 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:12.000
 Halftone you may not even see 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.560
 the curve myself as I have done in the 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.390
 gone since I already have some some 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.800
 I already adjustments are default 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.450
 or that we are already in the window 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.310
 envelope of tone that is the envelope 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.700
 it is this timeline that we are 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.250
 seeing 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:26.379
 basically it says in this case to vats 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:28.360
 that should make the tone along the 

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:31.150
 time is the beginning the first hype 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.590
 this is the last box and this curve is 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:34.569
 what we are telling you that the tone 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:36.760
 In this case, start in the 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:39.340
 same tone and go down if we started 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:41.980
 for example with the tone up here and 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:44.560
 we will end for example tone also here 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:47.260
 up the tone would start high would fall 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:49.660
 would go down and go back up 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:52.790
 we are going to place a curve right now 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:55.670
 something like this 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:57.650
 so that the tone starts normal such 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:00.439
 as it comes and is dedicated to going down in the 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:03.140
 time interval placed now 

00:03:00.439 --> 00:03:05.090
 12 semitones you see a lot 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:07.159
 of horizontal lines and we can 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:09.019
 get an idea of ​​what we are going to 

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:11.439
 ask me to do it by clicking on pre 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:11.439
 listen out 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:17.830
 you only have the effect of the vinyl but 

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:23.490
 we want it to be a little more drastic 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:23.490
 here and a little less drastic in the box 

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:28.630
 for example you can see that when you manipulate 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:30.760
 the envelope have changed the 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:32.830
 transposition semitone parameters 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.850
 of halftones and precise tuning 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:35.680
 perfect 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:37.270
 you can write them by hand what I give you 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.520
 I recommend that you directly draw 

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:42.810
 what kind of curve do you want we are going to 

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:44.370
 stay with this and we process 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:48.410
 and let's see what he has done let me 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:48.410
 Boot the next part 

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:57.270
 he just gave this is the effect of the stop 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:04:00.890
 of a vinyl and if I remove the snap with what 

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:00.890
 put here mesmo teo 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:05.750
 ah 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:12.800
 ok well up here without time what 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:17.209
 would be in this aspect something very classical 

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:19.220
 let's undo this and go back to where 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:22.150
 we were to place on his track and 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:22.150
 this is normal again 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:30.570
 let's do it now at the first tempo 

00:04:26.729 --> 00:04:32.340
 let's cut the last box this box 

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:36.449
 we no longer want it so that we 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:38.580
 left with back because while 

00:04:36.449 --> 00:04:40.710
 means that the loop has to go back to 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:43.380
 enter bar 8 we select the 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:45.840
 part we go back audio process 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:47.789
 concealer tone and pitch correction 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:50.070
 here I suppose you have this from 

00:04:47.789 --> 00:04:52.320
 new in a semitone what we have to 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:55.410
 do is try first to fill this 

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:57.330
 full space if I place for example 

00:04:55.410 --> 00:05:01.100
 six semitones 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:03.350
 and process I already know that I will not get there 

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:06.050
 two 

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:08.360
 the way I take you 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:10.430
 I return process 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:13.129
 and well I already know that more or less in 

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:18.560
 around 12 semitones will work the 

00:05:13.129 --> 00:05:20.870
 Once thing I maybe spent a little or not 

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:22.520
 sounds not bad at all anyway be it here 

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:24.139
 there is no magic formula will be depended 

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:25.789
 of the time of your instrumental and 

00:05:24.139 --> 00:05:28.039
 effect that you want to achieve but in 

00:05:25.789 --> 00:05:29.810
 around 12 semitones I know it's already going 

00:05:28.039 --> 00:05:32.960
 good again with tempo correction 

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:35.569
 time correction off you can 

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:37.639
 decide how much and how you want it to be 

00:05:35.569 --> 00:05:41.389
 this envelope curve look more 

00:05:37.639 --> 00:05:43.909
 hard and much harder than before 

00:05:41.389 --> 00:05:45.229
 we processed although I was wrong what 

00:05:43.909 --> 00:05:48.949
 that I should have undone so 

00:05:45.229 --> 00:05:51.529
 I'm going to undo and develop and now if the 

00:05:48.949 --> 00:05:55.069
 production of silver tone change the curve 

00:05:51.529 --> 00:05:56.870
 and process is that the lower the tone 

00:05:55.069 --> 00:05:59.719
 more stretches in time I liked 

00:05:56.870 --> 00:06:01.250
 how it had gone before so we're going to 

00:05:59.719 --> 00:06:02.990
 return to it you always have to go back to 

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:05.810
 the original version 

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:07.880
 almost this before I have not done it and I 

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:11.900
 I've eaten the brown tone correction 

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:15.169
 we said that 12 and more or less this does not 

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:22.479
 so hard with a pretty beast 

00:06:15.169 --> 00:06:22.479
 something like that is fine 

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:30.640
 so that now 

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:41.340
 Well here you have it in this case 

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:43.020
 tempo a good effect that in general in 

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:45.180
 all electronic music no longer just in 

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:47.580
 hip hop is used a lot and if the other 

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:49.770
 We were also discovering the 

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:52.020
 free vinyl plugin to create the 

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:53.730
 noise if you also add this type of 

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:55.470
 effects you get a very result 

00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:57.360
 convincing ok brother I hope you've 

00:06:55.470 --> 00:06:59.010
 enjoyed that you can apply it in your 

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:01.790
 future productions and see you in the 

00:06:59.010 --> 00:07:01.790
 next peace
