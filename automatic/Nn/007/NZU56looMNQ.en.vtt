I like to set up instrument buses

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.229 
I like to set up instrument buses

I<00:03:15.090> can<00:03:15.600> simply<00:03:15.959> do<00:03:16.110> it<00:03:16.140> from<00:03:16.680> the<00:03:16.799> bus<00:03:16.950> fader

I can simply do it from the bus fader

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.970 
I can simply do it from the bus fader
and<00:03:17.519> the<00:03:18.390> same<00:03:18.630> logic<00:03:19.019> applies<00:03:19.320> when<00:03:19.650> applying

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
and the same logic applies when applying

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.250 
and the same logic applies when applying
a<00:03:20.100> plug-in<00:03:20.519> if<00:03:20.670> I<00:03:21.420> want<00:03:21.630> to<00:03:21.720> add<00:03:21.840> a<00:03:21.870> compressor

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
a plug-in if I want to add a compressor

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.250 
a plug-in if I want to add a compressor
to<00:03:22.709> the<00:03:23.549> group<00:03:23.850> all<00:03:24.060> I<00:03:24.120> do<00:03:24.630> is<00:03:25.019> choose

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
to the group all I do is choose

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.699 
to the group all I do is choose
compressor<00:03:25.829> on<00:03:26.010> guitars<00:03:26.489> bus<00:03:26.790> and<00:03:27.060> then<00:03:27.959> we

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
compressor on guitars bus and then we

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:33.830 
compressor on guitars bus and then we
can<00:03:28.920> solo<00:03:29.190> out<00:03:29.400> the<00:03:29.579> guitars<00:03:30.049> and<00:03:32.720> listen<00:03:33.720> to

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
can solo out the guitars and listen to

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:38.270 
can solo out the guitars and listen to
them<00:03:33.959> through<00:03:34.200> the<00:03:34.320> bus<00:03:36.890> I'll<00:03:37.890> take<00:03:38.160> the

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
them through the bus I'll take the

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.970 
them through the bus I'll take the
record<00:03:38.670> enable<00:03:39.000> off<00:03:39.230> so<00:03:40.230> we<00:03:40.350> can<00:03:40.500> see<00:03:40.530> the

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
record enable off so we can see the

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:45.420 
record enable off so we can see the

00:03:50.339 --> 00:03:50.349 
and to further explain my example let's

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:52.140 
and to further explain my example let's
pan<00:03:50.650> these<00:03:50.890> left<00:03:51.189> and<00:03:51.370> right<00:03:51.519> just<00:03:51.549> for<00:03:51.970> now

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.150 
pan these left and right just for now

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:56.339 
pan these left and right just for now
I'll<00:03:53.019> set<00:03:53.409> up<00:03:53.439> a<00:03:53.590> four<00:03:53.829> bar<00:03:53.950> loop<00:03:55.110> we'll<00:03:56.110> start

00:03:56.339 --> 00:03:56.349 
I'll set up a four bar loop we'll start

00:03:56.349 --> 00:03:57.660 
I'll set up a four bar loop we'll start
right<00:03:56.500> at<00:03:56.650> measure<00:03:56.799> five<00:03:57.129> and<00:03:57.310> go<00:03:57.400> to<00:03:57.459> measure

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:57.670 
right at measure five and go to measure
