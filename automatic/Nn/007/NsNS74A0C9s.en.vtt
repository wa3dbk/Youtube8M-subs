bit broken around this edge right here

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.529 
bit broken around this edge right here
which<00:01:31.680> it<00:01:31.830> shouldn't<00:01:32.069> be<00:01:32.310> but<00:01:32.970> it<00:01:33.090> does<00:01:33.300> still

00:01:33.529 --> 00:01:33.539 
which it shouldn't be but it does still

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:36.139 
which it shouldn't be but it does still
work<00:01:33.810> and<00:01:34.050> it<00:01:34.200> does<00:01:34.350> still<00:01:34.590> stick<00:01:34.860> together<00:01:35.149> so

00:01:36.139 --> 00:01:36.149 
work and it does still stick together so

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:40.309 
work and it does still stick together so
we're<00:01:36.270> gonna<00:01:36.360> open<00:01:36.569> this<00:01:36.840> up<00:01:37.970> and<00:01:39.319> inside

00:01:40.309 --> 00:01:40.319 
we're gonna open this up and inside

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:44.230 
we're gonna open this up and inside

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.330 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.790 

now<00:02:12.330> I<00:02:12.360> have<00:02:12.629> seen<00:02:12.870> folks<00:02:13.140> put<00:02:13.410> these<00:02:13.590> things

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
now I have seen folks put these things

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.400 
now I have seen folks put these things
in<00:02:14.069> upside<00:02:14.459> down<00:02:14.760> actually<00:02:15.660> the<00:02:15.989> vehicle

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
in upside down actually the vehicle

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.350 
in upside down actually the vehicle
wouldn't<00:02:16.769> start<00:02:17.250> when<00:02:17.550> this<00:02:17.730> was<00:02:17.910> upside<00:02:18.330> down

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
if that batteries upside down that light

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.030 
if that batteries upside down that light
won't<00:02:52.560> work<00:02:52.769> so<00:02:54.349> the<00:02:55.349> next<00:02:55.560> thing<00:02:55.739> we're<00:02:55.920> going

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
won't work so the next thing we're going

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.270 
won't work so the next thing we're going
to<00:02:56.130> do<00:02:56.989> is<00:02:57.989> take<00:02:58.290> the<00:02:58.440> head<00:02:58.620> part<00:02:58.920> of<00:02:59.010> the<00:02:59.069> key

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
to do is take the head part of the key

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:03.110 
to do is take the head part of the key
where<00:03:00.090> the<00:03:00.180> buttons<00:03:00.480> go<00:03:01.940> we're<00:03:02.940> going<00:03:03.060> to

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
where the buttons go we're going to

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:07.190 
where the buttons go we're going to
reinstall<00:03:03.630> those<00:03:05.450> there's<00:03:06.450> a<00:03:06.569> little<00:03:06.840> panic

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
reinstall those there's a little panic

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:10.190 
reinstall those there's a little panic
piece<00:03:07.440> right<00:03:07.680> there<00:03:08.810> we're<00:03:09.810> going<00:03:09.930> to<00:03:09.989> set

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
piece right there we're going to set

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:18.140 
piece right there we're going to set
that<00:03:10.349> back<00:03:10.590> inside<00:03:10.980> there<00:03:16.760> then<00:03:17.760> we<00:03:17.880> have<00:03:18.030> our

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
that back inside there then we have our

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.110 
that back inside there then we have our
lock<00:03:18.389> and<00:03:18.600> unlock<00:03:19.549> we're<00:03:20.549> gonna<00:03:20.670> use<00:03:20.910> that

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
lock and unlock we're gonna use that

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:26.090 
lock and unlock we're gonna use that
back<00:03:21.389> in<00:03:21.630> there<00:03:24.079> and<00:03:25.079> the<00:03:25.410> best<00:03:25.560> way<00:03:25.739> I<00:03:25.769> found

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
back in there and the best way I found

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:30.500 
back in there and the best way I found
to<00:03:26.310> do<00:03:26.489> it<00:03:27.350> is<00:03:28.350> take<00:03:28.650> this<00:03:28.889> piece<00:03:29.299> put<00:03:30.299> it<00:03:30.329> in

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
to do it is take this piece put it in

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:34.849 
to do it is take this piece put it in
upside<00:03:30.630> down<00:03:32.989> so<00:03:33.989> it<00:03:34.079> fits<00:03:34.319> right<00:03:34.440> up<00:03:34.590> in<00:03:34.709> there

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:34.859 
upside down so it fits right up in there

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:40.720 
upside down so it fits right up in there
there's<00:03:35.069> the<00:03:35.310> LED<00:03:36.260> so<00:03:37.260> once<00:03:37.470> we<00:03:37.590> get<00:03:37.739> that

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:40.730 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:43.309 

we're<00:03:41.730> gonna<00:03:41.819> snap<00:03:42.150> these<00:03:42.389> two<00:03:42.600> halves<00:03:42.870> back

00:03:43.309 --> 00:03:43.319 
we're gonna snap these two halves back

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:47.090 
we're gonna snap these two halves back
together<00:03:45.079> and<00:03:46.079> of<00:03:46.230> course<00:03:46.440> this<00:03:46.620> does<00:03:46.859> work

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:47.100 
together and of course this does work

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:48.379 
together and of course this does work
easier<00:03:47.519> when<00:03:47.670> you<00:03:47.760> don't<00:03:47.880> have<00:03:48.120> the<00:03:48.209> keychain

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:48.389 
easier when you don't have the keychain

00:03:48.389 --> 00:03:57.570 
easier when you don't have the keychain
on<00:03:48.660> it<00:03:48.959> but<00:03:50.299> we're<00:03:51.299> gonna<00:03:51.450> do<00:03:51.630> it<00:03:51.780> anyway

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:57.580 

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:00.090 

and<00:03:58.090> there<00:03:58.240> you<00:03:58.330> go<00:03:58.530> it's<00:03:59.530> pretty<00:03:59.680> much<00:03:59.920> all<00:04:00.070> of

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:00.100 
and there you go it's pretty much all of

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:07.050 
and there you go it's pretty much all of
this<00:04:00.310> to<00:04:00.550> it<00:04:04.980> and<00:04:05.980> again<00:04:06.250> this<00:04:06.400> is<00:04:06.580> a<00:04:06.610> typical

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:07.060 
this to it and again this is a typical

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:09.150 
this to it and again this is a typical
Mitsubishi<00:04:07.480> key<00:04:07.780> Mitsubishi<00:04:08.530> started<00:04:09.010> this

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:09.160 
Mitsubishi key Mitsubishi started this

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:14.190 
Mitsubishi key Mitsubishi started this
and<00:04:09.430> 2006<00:04:11.310> it's<00:04:12.310> pretty<00:04:12.550> common<00:04:12.900> again<00:04:13.900> it's

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:14.200 
and 2006 it's pretty common again it's

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:17.100 
and 2006 it's pretty common again it's
more<00:04:14.440> than<00:04:14.800> just<00:04:15.070> a<00:04:15.190> lock<00:04:15.460> and<00:04:15.730> unlock<00:04:15.820> it<00:04:16.420> also

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:17.110 
more than just a lock and unlock it also

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:21.030 
more than just a lock and unlock it also
has<00:04:17.530> a<00:04:17.560> transmitter<00:04:18.520> inside<00:04:19.799> that<00:04:20.799> is<00:04:20.920> an

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:21.040 
has a transmitter inside that is an

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:23.490 
has a transmitter inside that is an
immobilizer<00:04:21.610> and<00:04:22.060> your<00:04:22.690> vehicle<00:04:23.050> won't<00:04:23.140> start

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:23.500 
immobilizer and your vehicle won't start

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:26.130 
immobilizer and your vehicle won't start
that's<00:04:23.710> not<00:04:23.890> programmed<00:04:24.690> and<00:04:25.690> that's<00:04:25.930> pretty

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:26.140 
that's not programmed and that's pretty

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:29.130 
that's not programmed and that's pretty
much<00:04:26.290> all<00:04:26.470> there<00:04:26.680> is<00:04:26.770> to<00:04:26.830> it
