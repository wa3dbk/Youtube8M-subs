next year well the graphics are are

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.030 
next year well the graphics are are
pretty<00:02:14.370> explicit<00:02:14.970> in<00:02:15.120> terms<00:02:15.420> of<00:02:16.010> naked<00:02:17.010> women

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
pretty explicit in terms of naked women

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.340 
pretty explicit in terms of naked women
on<00:02:17.370> the<00:02:17.520> snowboards<00:02:18.090> and<00:02:18.270> there<00:02:19.050> are<00:02:19.170> plenty

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
on the snowboards and there are plenty

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:23.240 
on the snowboards and there are plenty
of<00:02:19.760> plenty<00:02:20.760> of<00:02:20.850> girls<00:02:21.810> and<00:02:22.080> boys<00:02:22.230> who<00:02:22.260> ride<00:02:23.220> the

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
of plenty of girls and boys who ride the

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.340 
of plenty of girls and boys who ride the
mountains<00:02:23.790> who<00:02:24.270> go<00:02:24.540> skiing<00:02:24.930> and<00:02:25.140> snowboarding

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
mountains who go skiing and snowboarding

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:28.280 
mountains who go skiing and snowboarding
and<00:02:26.000> I<00:02:27.000> think<00:02:27.540> it's<00:02:27.690> clear<00:02:27.960> that<00:02:27.990> it

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
and I think it's clear that it

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:33.290 
and I think it's clear that it
objectifies<00:02:29.100> women<00:02:29.280> as<00:02:30.590> sex<00:02:31.590> objects<00:02:32.130> for<00:02:32.490> for

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
objectifies women as sex objects for for

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:36.470 
objectifies women as sex objects for for
men's<00:02:33.480> pleasure<00:02:33.780> I<00:02:34.489> think<00:02:35.489> the<00:02:35.700> objective<00:02:36.360> is

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
men's pleasure I think the objective is

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.210 
men's pleasure I think the objective is
to<00:02:36.690> get<00:02:36.810> burn<00:02:37.050> to<00:02:37.200> take<00:02:37.380> the<00:02:37.530> boards<00:02:37.739> off<00:02:37.980> the

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
to get burn to take the boards off the

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.630 
to get burn to take the boards off the
shelf<00:02:38.900> you<00:02:39.900> know<00:02:40.050> these<00:02:40.200> are<00:02:40.260> I<00:02:40.650> go

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
shelf you know these are I go

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.340 
shelf you know these are I go
snowboarding<00:02:42.330> you<00:02:42.720> know<00:02:42.810> I'll<00:02:42.870> go<00:02:42.930> with<00:02:43.200> my

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
snowboarding you know I'll go with my

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:45.920 
snowboarding you know I'll go with my
nephew<00:02:43.680> to<00:02:43.830> sugarbush<00:02:44.220> she's<00:02:44.640> 13<00:02:45.450> years<00:02:45.480> old

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
nephew to sugarbush she's 13 years old

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.320 
nephew to sugarbush she's 13 years old
and<00:02:46.250> I<00:02:47.250> think<00:02:47.459> it<00:02:47.550> just<00:02:47.580> sends<00:02:47.910> out<00:02:48.090> the<00:02:48.300> wrong

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
and I think it just sends out the wrong

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:52.100 
and I think it just sends out the wrong
message<00:02:48.510> I<00:02:49.400> am<00:02:50.400> a<00:02:50.430> woman<00:02:50.850> and<00:02:51.209> I<00:02:51.660> feel<00:02:51.930> that

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
message I am a woman and I feel that

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:55.250 
message I am a woman and I feel that
we've<00:02:52.320> been<00:02:52.470> ejected<00:02:52.940> rectified<00:02:53.940> and<00:02:54.260> also

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
we've been ejected rectified and also

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.640 
we've been ejected rectified and also
the<00:02:55.440> self<00:02:55.709> mutilation<00:02:56.720> factor<00:02:57.720> is<00:02:57.900> just<00:02:58.260> it's

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
the self mutilation factor is just it's

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:01.640 
the self mutilation factor is just it's
just<00:02:59.220> really<00:03:00.150> not<00:03:00.510> right<00:03:00.900> pictures<00:03:01.470> of

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
just really not right pictures of

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:03.380 
just really not right pictures of
pitches<00:03:02.100> and<00:03:02.280> I<00:03:02.340> guess<00:03:02.550> pitches<00:03:03.000> aren't<00:03:03.180> that

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
pitches and I guess pitches aren't that

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:05.270 
pitches and I guess pitches aren't that
bad<00:03:03.630> but<00:03:03.900> there<00:03:04.110> are<00:03:04.170> many<00:03:04.290> people<00:03:04.739> that<00:03:04.890> deal

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
bad but there are many people that deal

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.840 
bad but there are many people that deal
with<00:03:05.520> mutilated<00:03:06.120> bodies<00:03:06.510> all<00:03:06.810> the<00:03:06.840> time<00:03:07.140> and

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:07.850 
with mutilated bodies all the time and

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:11.600 
with mutilated bodies all the time and
they're<00:03:08.850> just<00:03:09.060> it's<00:03:10.050> not<00:03:10.590> really<00:03:11.070> good<00:03:11.340> to

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 
they're just it's not really good to

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:14.000 
they're just it's not really good to
take<00:03:12.600> a<00:03:12.660> look<00:03:12.840> at<00:03:12.959> that<00:03:12.989> they're<00:03:13.350> not<00:03:13.470> good<00:03:13.769> for

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
take a look at that they're not good for

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:15.560 
take a look at that they're not good for
the<00:03:14.040> children<00:03:14.130> and<00:03:14.910> not<00:03:15.030> good<00:03:15.330> for<00:03:15.540> the

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:15.570 
the children and not good for the

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:17.780 
the children and not good for the
squeamish<00:03:16.080> and<00:03:16.590> I<00:03:16.680> just<00:03:16.890> don't<00:03:17.130> really<00:03:17.519> see

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
squeamish and I just don't really see
