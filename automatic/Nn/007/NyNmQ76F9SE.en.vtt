00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
we'll be using registry editor to do

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.729 
we'll be using registry editor to do
that<00:00:31.650> so<00:00:32.040> go<00:00:32.219> to<00:00:32.279> start<00:00:32.669> run<00:00:33.120> on<00:00:33.420> a<00:00:33.480> run<00:00:34.320> promote

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
that so go to start run on a run promote

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:40.490 
that so go to start run on a run promote

machine<00:00:40.860> go<00:00:41.160> to<00:00:41.190> software<00:00:43.879> okay<00:00:44.879> then

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
machine go to software okay then

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:51.260

find shell icons as you can see now what

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.429 
find shell icons as you can see now what
we're<00:01:06.060> going<00:01:06.180> to<00:01:06.270> do<00:01:06.540> is<00:01:06.840> we're<00:01:07.229> going<00:01:07.350> to

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
we're going to do is we're going to

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.510 
we're going to do is we're going to
create<00:01:07.680> a<00:01:07.799> new<00:01:07.890> string<00:01:08.700> value<00:01:10.310> and<00:01:11.310> we're

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
create a new string value and we're

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.890 
create a new string value and we're
going<00:01:11.670> to<00:01:11.729> call<00:01:12.000> it<00:01:12.030> 29<00:01:12.810> exactly<00:01:13.470> 29<00:01:13.830> and

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:14.900 
going to call it 29 exactly 29 and

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:19.780 
going to call it 29 exactly 29 and
inside<00:01:16.340> we're<00:01:17.340> going<00:01:17.759> to<00:01:18.060> put<00:01:18.420> this<00:01:18.810> following

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:19.790 
inside we're going to put this following

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:26.410 
inside we're going to put this following
the<00:01:20.790> value<00:01:21.500> value<00:01:22.500> C<00:01:23.310> which<00:01:24.060> is<00:01:24.090> basically<00:01:25.049> the

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:26.420 
the value value C which is basically the

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:34.399 
the value value C which is basically the
route<00:01:27.560> to<00:01:28.560> something<00:01:29.360> shell32.dll<00:01:32.540> 50<00:01:33.540> it

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
route to something shell32.dll 50 it

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.399 
route to something shell32.dll 50 it
means<00:01:34.740> that<00:01:35.159> it's<00:01:35.880> an<00:01:36.090> empty<00:01:36.270> icon<00:01:36.630> that<00:01:37.170> means

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
instantly the changes we're going to

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:53.780 
instantly the changes we're going to
right<00:01:52.259> click<00:01:52.290> on<00:01:52.799> the<00:01:52.950> desktop<00:01:53.130> go<00:01:53.729> to

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
right click on the desktop go to

00:01:53.790 --> 00:02:01.060 
right click on the desktop go to
properties<00:01:54.119> and<00:01:54.720> under<00:01:55.439> the<00:01:55.619> appearance<00:01:58.159> tab

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:01.070 
properties and under the appearance tab

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:06.800 
properties and under the appearance tab
we're<00:02:02.070> going<00:02:02.250> to<00:02:02.490> change<00:02:02.969> the<00:02:03.810> icon<00:02:04.350> size<00:02:05.810> or

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
we're going to change the icon size or

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.780 
we're going to change the icon size or
something<00:02:07.649> else<00:02:07.940> for<00:02:08.940> example<00:02:09.420> large<00:02:09.720> phones

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:10.790 
something else for example large phones

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:13.670 
something else for example large phones
we're<00:02:11.790> just<00:02:12.030> going<00:02:12.240> to<00:02:12.270> have<00:02:12.450> to<00:02:12.480> make<00:02:12.870> windows

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
we're just going to have to make windows

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.820 
we're just going to have to make windows
force<00:02:14.069> itself<00:02:14.520> to<00:02:14.819> redraw<00:02:15.390> the<00:02:16.050> whole<00:02:16.260> visuals

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
force itself to redraw the whole visuals

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:20.300 
force itself to redraw the whole visuals
so<00:02:17.819> we<00:02:18.030> could<00:02:18.270> just<00:02:18.300> change<00:02:18.840> a<00:02:19.380> small<00:02:19.800> thing

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
so we could just change a small thing

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.410 
so we could just change a small thing
that<00:02:20.670> I<00:02:20.790> would<00:02:20.850> change<00:02:21.000> the<00:02:21.600> rest<00:02:22.250> okay<00:02:23.420> now

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
that I would change the rest okay now

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:31.640 
that I would change the rest okay now
let's<00:02:24.780> try<00:02:26.900> and<00:02:29.120> it<00:02:30.120> doesn't<00:02:30.750> work<00:02:30.930> now<00:02:31.260> what

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
let's try and it doesn't work now what

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:38.229 
let's try and it doesn't work now what
it<00:02:31.800> did<00:02:32.130> go<00:02:32.430> wrong<00:02:34.250> advanced<00:02:36.709> that<00:02:37.709> should<00:02:37.920> be

00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:38.239 
it did go wrong advanced that should be

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:48.820 
it did go wrong advanced that should be
they<00:02:39.239> go<00:02:39.480> icon<00:02:39.989> 31<00:02:42.080> initiate<00:02:45.800> I've<00:02:46.800> been<00:02:47.810> I've

they go icon 31 initiate I've been I've

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:52.790 
they go icon 31 initiate I've been I've
