I<00:04:21.090> don't<00:04:21.419> think<00:04:21.510> either<00:04:21.690> of<00:04:21.810> those<00:04:21.959> things<00:04:22.169> are

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:22.260 
I don't think either of those things are

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.290 
I don't think either of those things are
necessarily<00:04:22.650> bad<00:04:22.949> and<00:04:23.430> no<00:04:24.030> but<00:04:24.180> I've<00:04:24.270> been

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.300 
necessarily bad and no but I've been

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:25.020 
necessarily bad and no but I've been
having<00:04:24.449> a<00:04:24.630> really

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:25.030 
having a really

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:49.100 
having a really
like<00:04:25.150> a<00:04:25.210> lot<00:04:25.389> of<00:04:25.420> fun<00:04:25.690> drafting<00:04:26.080> arrests

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:49.110 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:52.460 

Rochester<00:04:50.099> drafting<00:04:50.550> not<00:04:50.699> close<00:04:50.939> I'm<00:04:51.780> very

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:52.470 
Rochester drafting not close I'm very

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:56.629 
Rochester drafting not close I'm very
disappointed<00:04:52.680> that<00:04:53.189> they<00:04:53.430> bring<00:04:54.180> back<00:04:55.639> for

00:04:56.629 --> 00:04:56.639 
disappointed that they bring back for

00:04:56.639 --> 00:04:59.480 
disappointed that they bring back for
this<00:04:56.789> DP<00:04:57.270> because<00:04:57.930> it<00:04:58.530> it<00:04:58.860> has<00:04:58.889> really<00:04:59.280> been

00:04:59.480 --> 00:04:59.490 
this DP because it it has really been

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:02.779 
this DP because it it has really been
those<00:04:59.789> skill<00:05:00.389> intensive<00:05:01.129> ever<00:05:02.129> played<00:05:02.430> I

00:05:02.779 --> 00:05:02.789 
those skill intensive ever played I

00:05:02.789 --> 00:05:04.610 
those skill intensive ever played I
think<00:05:03.210> regular<00:05:03.479> is<00:05:03.689> better<00:05:03.930> Rock<00:05:04.289> using<00:05:04.560> this

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:04.620 
think regular is better Rock using this

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:06.050 
think regular is better Rock using this
takes<00:05:04.860> too<00:05:05.009> long<00:05:05.039> no<00:05:05.400> one<00:05:05.430> ever<00:05:05.610> really<00:05:05.789> does

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:06.060 
takes too long no one ever really does

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:08.240 
takes too long no one ever really does
it<00:05:06.240> I<00:05:06.270> think<00:05:06.629> it's<00:05:06.960> better<00:05:07.259> just<00:05:07.379> to<00:05:07.590> do<00:05:07.770> it<00:05:07.800> 3v3

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:08.250 
it I think it's better just to do it 3v3

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:10.040 
it I think it's better just to do it 3v3

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:23.430 
too but it's it is more skill testing

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:26.300 
too but it's it is more skill testing
but<00:05:23.940> that<00:05:24.060> doesn't<00:05:24.330> make<00:05:24.389> it<00:05:24.449> more<00:05:24.629> fun<00:05:25.310> giving

but that doesn't make it more fun giving
a<00:05:26.789> perfect<00:05:27.330> world<00:05:27.690> Rochester<00:05:29.389> what

a perfect world Rochester what

00:05:30.389 --> 00:05:33.159 
a perfect world Rochester what
logistically<00:05:31.020> it's<00:05:31.229> just<00:05:31.530> too<00:05:31.710> hard

00:05:33.159 --> 00:05:33.169 
logistically it's just too hard

00:05:33.169 --> 00:05:37.659 
logistically it's just too hard
the<00:05:34.169> GPS<00:05:35.129> are<00:05:35.340> like<00:05:35.520> two<00:05:36.509> three<00:05:36.900> times<00:05:36.990> bigger

00:05:37.659 --> 00:05:37.669 
the GPS are like two three times bigger

00:05:37.669 --> 00:05:40.640 
the GPS are like two three times bigger
now<00:05:38.669> than<00:05:38.699> they<00:05:39.120> were<00:05:39.150> when<00:05:39.469> Rochester<00:05:40.469> was<00:05:40.590> a

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:40.650 
now than they were when Rochester was a

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:44.029 
now than they were when Rochester was a
thing<00:05:40.889> so<00:05:41.930> the<00:05:42.930> logistics<00:05:43.080> was<00:05:43.500> just<00:05:43.650> so<00:05:43.830> hard

00:05:44.029 --> 00:05:44.039 
thing so the logistics was just so hard

00:05:44.039 --> 00:05:48.230 
thing so the logistics was just so hard
I<00:05:44.159> mean<00:05:44.419> this<00:05:45.419> tournament<00:05:46.229> we<00:05:46.469> had<00:05:47.240> eleven

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:48.240 
I mean this tournament we had eleven

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:49.700 
I mean this tournament we had eleven
rounds<00:05:48.449> on<00:05:48.779> day<00:05:48.930> one<00:05:49.169> it's<00:05:49.439> just<00:05:49.529> like

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:49.710 
rounds on day one it's just like

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:52.519 
rounds on day one it's just like
ridiculous<00:05:50.189> and<00:05:50.580> to<00:05:51.330> do<00:05:51.509> roster<00:05:51.960> just<00:05:51.990> it<00:05:52.349> just

00:05:52.519 --> 00:05:52.529 
ridiculous and to do roster just it just

00:05:52.529 --> 00:05:53.990 
ridiculous and to do roster just it just
takes<00:05:52.710> too<00:05:52.860> long<00:05:52.889> as<00:05:53.310> much<00:05:53.520> as<00:05:53.639> I'd<00:05:53.729> love<00:05:53.849> to

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:54.000 
takes too long as much as I'd love to

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.170 
takes too long as much as I'd love to
see<00:05:54.150> it<00:05:54.240> it's<00:05:54.419> not<00:05:54.990> lighter<00:05:55.879> team<00:05:56.879> booster

00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:57.180 
see it it's not lighter team booster

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:58.519 
see it it's not lighter team booster

with Rochester in teams two top boards

with Rochester in teams two top boards
besides<00:06:04.710> that<00:06:04.979> but<00:06:05.819> even<00:06:06.629> though<00:06:06.719> I'd<00:06:06.870> say

00:06:07.159 --> 00:06:07.169 
besides that but even though I'd say

00:06:07.169 --> 00:06:08.540 
besides that but even though I'd say
it's<00:06:07.379> better<00:06:07.589> for<00:06:07.830> me<00:06:07.949> it's<00:06:08.129> worth<00:06:08.310> school

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:08.550 
it's better for me it's worth school

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:09.649 
it's better for me it's worth school
testing<00:06:08.879> and<00:06:08.969> I<00:06:09.000> have<00:06:09.089> a<00:06:09.120> lot<00:06:09.240> of<00:06:09.270> experience

00:06:09.649 --> 00:06:09.659 
testing and I have a lot of experience

00:06:09.659 --> 00:06:13.550 
testing and I have a lot of experience
at<00:06:09.779> it<00:06:09.870> team<00:06:10.409> boosters<00:06:10.800> it's<00:06:10.949> more<00:06:11.099> fun<00:06:11.750> but<00:06:12.750> it

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:13.560 
at it team boosters it's more fun but it

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:17.029 
at it team boosters it's more fun but it
is<00:06:13.710> a<00:06:14.430> formats<00:06:15.330> that<00:06:15.479> is<00:06:15.870> probably<00:06:16.500> a<00:06:16.589> bit<00:06:16.800> hard

00:06:17.029 --> 00:06:17.039 
is a formats that is probably a bit hard

00:06:17.039 --> 00:06:21.499 
is a formats that is probably a bit hard
to<00:06:17.159> step<00:06:18.029> into<00:06:18.240> as<00:06:18.629> a<00:06:18.960> new<00:06:19.169> player<00:06:20.150> the<00:06:21.150> formula

00:06:21.499 --> 00:06:21.509 
to step into as a new player the formula

00:06:21.509 --> 00:06:24.079 
to step into as a new player the formula
they<00:06:21.629> have<00:06:21.779> here<00:06:22.199> like<00:06:22.500> the<00:06:22.680> team<00:06:23.159> draft<00:06:23.460> which

00:06:24.079 --> 00:06:24.089 
they have here like the team draft which

00:06:24.089 --> 00:06:26.530 
they have here like the team draft which
is<00:06:24.210> much<00:06:24.389> closer<00:06:24.629> to<00:06:24.839> the<00:06:24.990> booster<00:06:25.680> draft

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:26.540 
is much closer to the booster draft

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:44.850 
is much closer to the booster draft
that<00:06:27.170> everyone<00:06:27.440> knows<00:06:27.770> how<00:06:28.010> to<00:06:28.070> how<00:06:28.670> to<00:06:28.700> handle

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:44.860 

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:51.490 

you

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:51.500 

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:52.630 

not<00:06:51.710> a<00:06:51.740> thing<00:06:51.950> that<00:06:52.010> should<00:06:52.280> we<00:06:52.370> have<00:06:52.460> to

00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:52.640 
not a thing that should we have to

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:54.040 
not a thing that should we have to
question<00:06:52.970> if<00:06:53.060> we<00:06:53.210> can<00:06:53.390> get<00:06:53.510> a<00:06:53.540> go<00:06:53.690> there<00:06:53.870> that

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:54.050 
question if we can get a go there that

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:56.500 
question if we can get a go there that
you<00:06:54.320> folder<00:06:54.770> again<00:06:55.100> with<00:06:55.370> both<00:06:55.550> limits<00:06:56.090> and

00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:56.510 
you folder again with both limits and

00:06:56.510 --> 00:07:01.780 
you folder again with both limits and
constructors<00:06:57.140> I<00:06:58.120> mean<00:06:59.920> huge<00:07:00.920> turnout<00:07:01.490> to<00:07:01.640> this

00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:06.710 
that the threat be formally popular I'd

00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:09.220

like to see there be a team protein but
at<00:07:09.380> out<00:07:09.500> of<00:07:09.530> those<00:07:09.680> realistic<00:07:10.310> just<00:07:10.580> given<00:07:10.790> the

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:10.850 
at out of those realistic just given the

00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:12.880 
at out of those realistic just given the
fact<00:07:11.030> that<00:07:11.120> yeah<00:07:11.780> we<00:07:11.960> only<00:07:12.290> have<00:07:12.500> three<00:07:12.740> Pro

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:12.890

00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:14.530 
fact that yeah we only have three Pro
Tours<00:07:13.160> plus<00:07:13.430> the<00:07:13.700> plan<00:07:13.970> Championships<00:07:14.420> and

World<00:07:14.600> Cup<00:07:14.900> now<00:07:15.050> I<00:07:15.320> will<00:07:15.830> certainly<00:07:16.010> wouldn't

00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:16.310 
World Cup now I will certainly wouldn't

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:17.590 
World Cup now I will certainly wouldn't
want<00:07:16.430> to<00:07:16.550> replace<00:07:16.730> an<00:07:16.880> individual<00:07:17.270> Pro<00:07:17.420> Tour

00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:17.600 
want to replace an individual Pro Tour

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:18.670 
want to replace an individual Pro Tour
but<00:07:17.750> I'd<00:07:17.840> love<00:07:17.960> to<00:07:18.020> see<00:07:18.140> it<00:07:18.290> happen<00:07:18.350> in

00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:18.680 
but I'd love to see it happen in

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:22.570 
but I'd love to see it happen in
addition<00:07:19.010> I<00:07:19.540> think<00:07:20.800> but<00:07:21.800> it's<00:07:22.040> also<00:07:22.190> cool<00:07:22.460> to

00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:22.580 
addition I think but it's also cool to

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:25.480 
addition I think but it's also cool to
let<00:07:22.730> everyone<00:07:23.210> play<00:07:23.510> the<00:07:23.660> team<00:07:23.810> events<00:07:24.140> so<00:07:24.490> if

00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:25.490 
let everyone play the team events so if

00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:27.160 
let everyone play the team events so if
there<00:07:25.850> were<00:07:25.970> another<00:07:26.330> Pro<00:07:26.600> Tour<00:07:26.810> which<00:07:27.020> would

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:27.170 
there were another Pro Tour which would

00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:28.420 
there were another Pro Tour which would
also<00:07:27.290> be<00:07:27.530> awesome<00:07:27.560> I<00:07:27.920> could<00:07:28.070> see<00:07:28.190> it<00:07:28.280> being

00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:28.430 
also be awesome I could see it being

00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:30.190 
also be awesome I could see it being
teams<00:07:28.670> but<00:07:28.910> I'm<00:07:29.330> fine<00:07:29.600> with<00:07:29.630> it<00:07:29.810> being<00:07:30.020> Grand

00:07:30.190 --> 00:07:30.200 
teams but I'm fine with it being Grand

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:33.040 
teams but I'm fine with it being Grand
Prix's<00:07:30.410> for<00:07:30.590> now<00:07:30.680> like<00:07:31.250> a<00:07:31.280> pro<00:07:31.550> tour<00:07:32.050> doesn't

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:33.050 
Prix's for now like a pro tour doesn't

00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:34.330 
Prix's for now like a pro tour doesn't
have<00:07:33.200> the<00:07:33.380> same<00:07:33.590> kind<00:07:33.800> of<00:07:33.860> thing<00:07:34.070> that<00:07:34.100> the

00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:34.340 
have the same kind of thing that the

00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:36.400 
have the same kind of thing that the
teams<00:07:34.670> do<00:07:34.940> I<00:07:34.970> mean<00:07:35.210> I<00:07:35.240> would<00:07:35.810> like<00:07:35.960> a<00:07:35.990> team<00:07:36.260> Pro

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:36.410 
teams do I mean I would like a team Pro

00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:37.900 
teams do I mean I would like a team Pro
Tour<00:07:36.620> but<00:07:36.740> I'd<00:07:36.860> rather<00:07:36.950> have<00:07:37.190> a<00:07:37.250> bunch<00:07:37.610> of<00:07:37.700> team

00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:37.910 
Tour but I'd rather have a bunch of team

00:07:37.910 --> 00:07:40.330 
Tour but I'd rather have a bunch of team
Grand<00:07:38.180> Prix's<00:07:38.450> you<00:07:39.110> know<00:07:39.230> like<00:07:39.830> a<00:07:39.860> team<00:07:39.950> Pro

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:40.340 
Grand Prix's you know like a team Pro

00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:43.780 
Grand Prix's you know like a team Pro
Tour<00:07:40.550> I<00:07:41.230> would<00:07:42.230> like<00:07:42.380> it<00:07:42.530> better<00:07:42.740> than<00:07:42.980> not<00:07:43.220> but

00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:43.790 
Tour I would like it better than not but

00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:45.310 
Tour I would like it better than not but
if<00:07:43.910> there's<00:07:44.120> a<00:07:44.180> finite<00:07:44.540> amount<00:07:44.570> of<00:07:44.840> resources

00:07:45.310 --> 00:07:45.320 
if there's a finite amount of resources

00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:47.260 
if there's a finite amount of resources
I<00:07:45.560> wonder<00:07:45.919> if<00:07:46.310> it's<00:07:46.490> the<00:07:46.610> best<00:07:46.790> way<00:07:46.940> to<00:07:46.970> do<00:07:47.150> it

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:47.270 
I wonder if it's the best way to do it

00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:48.820 
I wonder if it's the best way to do it
because<00:07:47.360> so<00:07:47.720> many<00:07:47.870> of<00:07:48.020> the<00:07:48.230> awesome<00:07:48.590> teams

00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:48.830 
because so many of the awesome teams

00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:50.770 
because so many of the awesome teams
that<00:07:49.010> I'd<00:07:49.100> want<00:07:49.280> to<00:07:49.340> see<00:07:49.460> come<00:07:49.669> out<00:07:49.790> are<00:07:50.570> people

00:07:50.770 --> 00:07:50.780 
that I'd want to see come out are people

00:07:50.780 --> 00:08:00.270 
that I'd want to see come out are people
who<00:07:50.990> weren't<00:07:51.080> currently<00:07:51.410> on<00:07:51.650> the<00:07:51.770> Pro<00:07:51.919> Tour

00:08:00.270 --> 00:08:00.280
