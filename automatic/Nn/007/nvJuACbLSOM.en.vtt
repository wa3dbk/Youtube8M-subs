00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
yeah that's what I always say at the

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.630 
yeah that's what I always say at the
beginning<00:00:36.809> it<00:00:37.260> doesn't<00:00:37.500> work<00:00:38.309> at<00:00:38.430> all<00:00:38.460> the

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
beginning it doesn't work at all the

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.369 
beginning it doesn't work at all the
times<00:00:38.820> I<00:00:39.090> used<00:00:39.390> to<00:00:39.450> wear<00:00:39.570> false<00:00:39.719> eyelashes<00:00:40.200> all

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
times I used to wear false eyelashes all

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:41.750 
times I used to wear false eyelashes all
the<00:00:40.500> time<00:00:40.710> sometimes<00:00:41.129> when<00:00:41.340> I<00:00:41.370> used<00:00:41.579> to<00:00:41.610> apply

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
the time sometimes when I used to apply

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.090 
the time sometimes when I used to apply
my<00:00:42.660> lashes<00:00:42.809> with<00:00:43.200> just<00:00:43.559> straight<00:00:43.739> out<00:00:43.860> of<00:00:43.920> the

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
my lashes with just straight out of the

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.619 
my lashes with just straight out of the
tube<00:00:44.250> it<00:00:44.489> would<00:00:44.579> just<00:00:44.760> kind<00:00:44.850> of<00:00:44.969> gloop

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
tube it would just kind of gloop

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.090 
tube it would just kind of gloop
everywhere<00:00:46.230> so<00:00:46.410> it's<00:00:46.500> just<00:00:46.649> kind<00:00:46.829> of<00:00:46.860> a<00:00:46.950> mess

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
everywhere so it's just kind of a mess

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.490 
everywhere so it's just kind of a mess
so<00:00:47.370> hopefully<00:00:47.760> this<00:00:48.030> will<00:00:48.300> eliminate<00:00:48.510> first

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
so hopefully this will eliminate first

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.020 
so hopefully this will eliminate first
we're<00:00:49.710> gonna<00:00:49.800> try<00:00:50.070> it<00:00:50.129> just<00:00:50.489> with<00:00:50.730> a<00:00:50.760> little

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.080 
it doesn't apply like that much flu
which<00:01:39.830> could<00:01:40.830> be<00:01:40.950> a<00:01:40.979> good<00:01:41.189> thing<00:01:41.250> so<00:01:41.729> it's<00:01:41.970> not

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
which could be a good thing so it's not

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.139 
which could be a good thing so it's not
getting<00:01:42.990> everywhere<00:01:43.490> it<00:01:44.490> is<00:01:44.549> a<00:01:44.610> weird<00:01:44.909> color

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
getting everywhere it is a weird color

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:49.600 
getting everywhere it is a weird color
so<00:01:45.530> okay

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:49.610 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.690 

um<00:01:50.030> I<00:01:50.660> feel<00:01:51.470> like<00:01:51.590> there's<00:01:51.800> not<00:01:52.130> that<00:01:52.520> much

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700 
um I feel like there's not that much

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:59.470 
um I feel like there's not that much
glue<00:01:53.210> on<00:01:55.570> but<00:01:56.570> making<00:01:56.930> it<00:01:57.020> work<00:01:57.170> okay<00:01:58.270> that<00:01:59.270> one

00:01:59.470 --> 00:01:59.480 
glue on but making it work okay that one

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:01.060 
glue on but making it work okay that one
was<00:01:59.690> actually<00:02:00.140> not<00:02:00.380> that<00:02:00.410> bad<00:02:00.740> and<00:02:00.980> I<00:02:01.010> don't

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:01.070 
was actually not that bad and I don't

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:03.330 
was actually not that bad and I don't
think<00:02:01.670> there's<00:02:01.850> going<00:02:02.030> to<00:02:02.120> be<00:02:02.180> like<00:02:02.420> dry<00:02:02.870> glue

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:03.340 
think there's going to be like dry glue

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:06.070 
think there's going to be like dry glue
residue<00:02:04.340> showing<00:02:05.000> there's<00:02:05.210> a<00:02:05.300> world<00:02:05.840> of

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:06.080 
residue showing there's a world of

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.050 
residue showing there's a world of
difference<00:02:06.440> like<00:02:06.710> there's<00:02:07.280> such<00:02:07.640> different

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060 
difference like there's such different

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:09.850 
difference like there's such different

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
sizes I know they feel like it's not

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:11.740 
sizes I know they feel like it's not
gonna<00:02:09.979> apply<00:02:10.220> the<00:02:10.280> glue<00:02:10.550> everywhere<00:02:10.910> yeah<00:02:11.480> I

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000 
the bobby pin way yeah I feel like if

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.150 
the bobby pin way yeah I feel like if
you<00:03:31.090> had<00:03:31.270> a<00:03:31.300> tube<00:03:31.750> of<00:03:31.990> blue<00:03:32.200> with<00:03:32.500> the<00:03:32.980> lashes

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:33.160 
you had a tube of blue with the lashes

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.040 
you had a tube of blue with the lashes
that<00:03:33.490> was<00:03:33.640> just<00:03:33.820> a<00:03:34.000> tube<00:03:34.360> and<00:03:34.510> not<00:03:34.660> the<00:03:34.840> brush

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:35.050 
that was just a tube and not the brush

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:37.350 
that was just a tube and not the brush
then<00:03:35.380> this<00:03:35.890> the<00:03:36.190> volume<00:03:36.550> way<00:03:36.670> may<00:03:36.880> be<00:03:36.910> a<00:03:37.180> lot

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:37.360
