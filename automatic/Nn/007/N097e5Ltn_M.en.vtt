the<00:00:26.220> ACOG<00:00:26.550> scope<00:00:26.580> on<00:00:27.029> it<00:00:27.060> I<00:00:27.330> believe<00:00:27.720> that<00:00:27.990> it

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
the ACOG scope on it I believe that it

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.410 
the ACOG scope on it I believe that it
gives<00:00:28.349> it<00:00:28.590> makes<00:00:28.920> you<00:00:29.039> more<00:00:29.279> a<00:00:29.580> threat<00:00:30.179> it

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
gives it makes you more a threat it

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.209 
gives it makes you more a threat it
gives<00:00:30.660> you<00:00:30.779> more<00:00:31.019> versatility<00:00:31.439> than<00:00:31.710> using

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
gives you more versatility than using

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.840 
gives you more versatility than using
the<00:00:32.460> four-time<00:00:33.210> scope<00:00:33.540> or<00:00:33.719> six<00:00:33.960> times<00:00:33.989> scope

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:34.850 
the four-time scope or six times scope

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:37.729 
the four-time scope or six times scope
66<00:00:35.850> times<00:00:36.149> scope<00:00:36.480> in<00:00:36.660> my<00:00:36.780> opinion<00:00:36.989> is<00:00:37.140> just<00:00:37.170> way

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
66 times scope in my opinion is just way

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.250 
66 times scope in my opinion is just way
too<00:00:37.800> zoomed<00:00:38.370> in<00:00:38.579> to<00:00:38.820> play<00:00:39.329> aggressively<00:00:39.899> so<00:00:40.170> if

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
too zoomed in to play aggressively so if

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.959

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.840 
that's actually wrong with the game in
my<00:02:00.750> opinion<00:02:00.780> too<00:02:01.619> many<00:02:01.799> grunts<00:02:02.219> of<00:02:02.369> course<00:02:02.610> you

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
my opinion too many grunts of course you

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.190 
my opinion too many grunts of course you
guys<00:02:03.000> know<00:02:03.180> that<00:02:03.210> the<00:02:04.079> lack<00:02:04.320> of

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:05.200 
guys know that the lack of

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.330 
guys know that the lack of
variety<00:02:06.200> of<00:02:06.230> weapons<00:02:06.440> there's<00:02:06.920> only<00:02:07.100> two

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 
variety of weapons there's only two

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:09.219 
variety of weapons there's only two
sniper<00:02:07.610> rifles<00:02:08.060> I<00:02:08.210> think<00:02:08.450> to<00:02:08.570> assault<00:02:08.869> rifles

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
sniper rifles I think to assault rifles

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:11.260 
sniper rifles I think to assault rifles
and<00:02:09.500> to<00:02:09.740> submachine<00:02:10.399> guns<00:02:10.610> one<00:02:10.820> time<00:02:11.000> machine

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:11.270 
and to submachine guns one time machine

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:15.370 
and to submachine guns one time machine
gun<00:02:11.450> and<00:02:12.730> in<00:02:13.730> my<00:02:13.910> opinion<00:02:14.030> it<00:02:14.420> if<00:02:14.720> this<00:02:15.170> game

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
gun and in my opinion it if this game

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.830 
gun and in my opinion it if this game
had<00:02:15.410> a<00:02:15.590> big<00:02:15.800> team<00:02:16.180> game<00:02:17.180> type<00:02:17.450> it<00:02:17.660> would<00:02:17.750> have

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
had a big team game type it would have

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.410 
had a big team game type it would have
made<00:02:17.960> it<00:02:18.110> so<00:02:18.380> much<00:02:18.440> more<00:02:18.590> fun<00:02:18.980> like<00:02:19.040> 12<00:02:19.520> v12<00:02:19.970> 499

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 
made it so much more fun like 12 v12 499

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:23.260 
made it so much more fun like 12 v12 499
take<00:02:21.350> full<00:02:21.590> advantage<00:02:21.650> of<00:02:22.100> the<00:02:22.220> next-gen<00:02:22.730> that

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:23.270 
take full advantage of the next-gen that

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:24.640 
take full advantage of the next-gen that
would<00:02:23.390> have<00:02:23.480> made<00:02:23.570> this<00:02:23.720> game<00:02:23.930> so<00:02:24.200> much<00:02:24.380> better

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
would have made this game so much better

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:27.400
