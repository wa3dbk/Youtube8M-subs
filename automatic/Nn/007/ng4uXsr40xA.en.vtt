00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:18.000
 this season the fringe trend is 

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:20.520
 has come very very strong and to me 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.100
 love the truth but you do not need to go to 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.830
 spend too much money to have it 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:28.830
 you can modify items that you already have 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:31.529
 in your house and even accessories this time 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.240
 I said do it with a bag but 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.579
 You can even do it in a vest 

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:38.100
 that is of this material like skin 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:41.010
 synthetic I 'm going to do it in this 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.770
 little bag but it can be in someone else who 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.410
 have another way we will use by 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:50.579
 Of course one takes scissors bite 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:52.800
 manual or blow and this thread that is 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.890
 super economic you get it in 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.989
 any any haberdashery first 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.210
 what we are going to do is measure more or less 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:03.030
 that the length you want each thread and 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.790
 then we 're going to fold it in half and 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:09.270
 right there we are going to cut out trim 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:12.620
 many about 20-25 depends on how 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.620
 thick you want it to look 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:33.909
 and now mark in your bag or in your 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:36.820
 portfolio or in your cloud with the help of a 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:41.159
 pencil where we are going to make each ojito 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:41.159
 with the take out bite to not be mistaken 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:48.409
 and if you are interested in me selling 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:50.690
 this punch nothing more so that 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:53.000
 you make it easier to ask for the 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:54.680
 of mel or know in the comments because 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.880
 the truth is that I use it a lot 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:02:01.490
 for different equal days and what 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:05.240
 we put in and in this space that we have left 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:08.090
 we put the surplus and simply 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:11.630
 we pull and it's ready without sewing anything 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:14.600
 without complicating the life and the finish 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:18.760
 that leaves the snack in the bag 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:18.760
 It's very clean so it looks good 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:50.280
 I put on this outfit because it's 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:52.040
 raining a lot in the city of mexico 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:56.360
 so I'm using a few droplets 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:56.360
 my favorite jeans 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:08.580
 this shirt and I love sara 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:11.130
 this melody yoyo vest that I 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:13.800
 really liked the fringe but I should 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:16.830
 admit to them that it is not the great quality 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:18.930
 so for the price I think it's not 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:20.580
 the great quality but anyway if 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:23.070
 they want to go see them I leave the link in 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:28.220
 the information box and the sachet 

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:28.220
 with which I made the day cool is from h &amp; m
