00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:45.549 
model for Santa Fe and then the computer
is<00:00:44.750> going<00:00:44.840> to<00:00:44.960> tell<00:00:45.079> us<00:00:45.110> how<00:00:45.260> to<00:00:45.290> mould<00:00:45.530> the

00:00:45.549 --> 00:00:45.559 
is going to tell us how to mould the

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:49.030 
is going to tell us how to mould the
sand<00:00:46.000> and<00:00:47.000> here<00:00:47.930> the<00:00:48.079> computer<00:00:48.500> is<00:00:48.710> telling<00:00:48.950> me

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:49.040 
sand and here the computer is telling me

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:50.619 
sand and here the computer is telling me
where<00:00:49.219> to<00:00:49.250> move<00:00:49.460> the<00:00:49.670> sand<00:00:49.940> out<00:00:50.090> of<00:00:50.239> the<00:00:50.329> areas

00:00:50.619 --> 00:00:50.629 
where to move the sand out of the areas

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:53.530 
where to move the sand out of the areas
of<00:00:50.780> red<00:00:50.989> over<00:00:51.860> to<00:00:51.980> the<00:00:52.070> areas<00:00:52.399> in<00:00:52.550> green<00:00:52.579> and

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:53.540 
of red over to the areas in green and

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:54.940 
of red over to the areas in green and
this<00:00:53.629> will<00:00:53.840> help<00:00:53.989> me<00:00:54.079> make<00:00:54.200> the<00:00:54.350> topography<00:00:54.860> of

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:54.950 
this will help me make the topography of

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:58.150 
this will help me make the topography of
Santa<00:00:55.219> Fe<00:00:55.420> and<00:00:56.420> so<00:00:57.140> here<00:00:57.379> is<00:00:57.500> the<00:00:57.680> 3d<00:00:57.980> molded

of<00:01:53.420> the<00:01:53.509> features<00:01:53.810> I<00:01:53.930> need<00:01:54.079> to<00:01:54.229> start<00:01:54.439> a

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:54.500 
of the features I need to start a

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.679 
of the features I need to start a
wildfire<00:01:54.850> which<00:01:55.850> I'm<00:01:56.000> gonna<00:01:56.119> do<00:01:56.270> right<00:01:56.450> now

00:01:56.679 --> 00:01:56.689 
wildfire which I'm gonna do right now

00:01:56.689 --> 00:01:58.149 
wildfire which I'm gonna do right now
I'm<00:01:56.899> gonna<00:01:57.079> load<00:01:57.229> a<00:01:57.259> simulation<00:01:57.860> of<00:01:58.070> a

00:01:58.149 --> 00:01:58.159 
I'm gonna load a simulation of a

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:00.249 
I'm gonna load a simulation of a
wildfire<00:01:58.549> and<00:01:58.759> spark<00:01:59.570> it<00:01:59.750> with<00:01:59.990> a<00:02:00.020> real

00:02:00.249 --> 00:02:00.259 
wildfire and spark it with a real

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:05.469 
wildfire and spark it with a real
lighter<00:02:03.579> and<00:02:04.579> here<00:02:04.790> you<00:02:04.880> can<00:02:05.000> see<00:02:05.180> the<00:02:05.299> fire

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479 
lighter and here you can see the fire

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:10.719 
lighter and here you can see the fire
starting<00:02:06.049> and<00:02:06.200> moving<00:02:07.130> to<00:02:07.700> the<00:02:07.820> southwest<00:02:09.729> if

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729 
starting and moving to the southwest if

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:12.910 
starting and moving to the southwest if
I<00:02:10.850> change<00:02:11.209> the<00:02:11.420> wind<00:02:11.600> vector<00:02:11.930> you<00:02:12.470> can<00:02:12.620> see<00:02:12.829> the

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
I change the wind vector you can see the

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.069 
I change the wind vector you can see the
behavior<00:02:13.310> of<00:02:13.340> the<00:02:13.459> fire<00:02:13.640> shifting<00:02:14.180> and<00:02:14.360> moving

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:15.079 
behavior of the fire shifting and moving

00:02:15.079 --> 00:02:18.009 
behavior of the fire shifting and moving
along<00:02:15.320> with<00:02:15.739> the<00:02:15.860> wind<00:02:16.120> if<00:02:17.120> I<00:02:17.299> reduce<00:02:17.630> the<00:02:17.810> wind

00:02:18.009 --> 00:02:18.019 
along with the wind if I reduce the wind

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:20.080 
along with the wind if I reduce the wind
you<00:02:18.500> can<00:02:18.650> see<00:02:18.770> it's<00:02:18.920> only<00:02:19.099> a<00:02:19.280> topographically

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
you can see it's only a topographically

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:22.070
