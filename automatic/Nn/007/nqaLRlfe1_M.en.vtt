00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:50.130 
just some you how do you know Berkeley I

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:52.550 
just some you how do you know Berkeley I
did<00:00:50.700> a<00:00:50.730> lot<00:00:50.970> of<00:00:51.000> research<00:00:51.300> online<00:00:51.750> and<00:00:51.990> then<00:00:52.530> I

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:52.560 
did a lot of research online and then I

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:55.520 
did a lot of research online and then I
have<00:00:52.890> friends<00:00:53.340> who<00:00:53.490> just<00:00:53.790> three<00:00:54.690> of<00:00:54.840> them<00:00:55.020> who

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
have friends who just three of them who

did<00:00:56.340> lastic<00:00:57.060> surgery<00:00:57.390> here<00:00:57.750> and<00:00:57.990> they<00:00:58.140> went

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
did lastic surgery here and they went

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.350 
did lastic surgery here and they went
back<00:00:58.890> to<00:00:59.010> Singapore<00:00:59.280> with<00:00:59.550> very<00:00:59.880> good<00:01:00.000> result

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:00.360 
back to Singapore with very good result

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:05.440 
back to Singapore with very good result
so<00:01:00.540> I<00:01:00.570> decided<00:01:01.020> to<00:01:02.390> look<00:01:03.390> for<00:01:03.660> a<00:01:03.690> document

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:05.450 
so I decided to look for a document

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:08.480 
so I decided to look for a document
which<00:01:06.450> surgery<00:01:06.930> you<00:01:07.080> would<00:01:07.140> like<00:01:07.530> to<00:01:07.770> have<00:01:07.980> and

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
which surgery you would like to have and

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.300 
which surgery you would like to have and
why<00:01:08.730> I<00:01:09.120> like<00:01:09.960> to<00:01:10.170> introduce<00:01:10.560> my<00:01:10.800> nose<00:01:11.010> a<00:01:11.040> little

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
why I like to introduce my nose a little

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.150 
why I like to introduce my nose a little
as<00:01:11.850> you<00:01:12.090> can<00:01:12.270> see<00:01:12.540> I<00:01:13.110> find<00:01:13.500> that<00:01:13.590> it's<00:01:13.800> a<00:01:13.950> bit

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:14.160 
as you can see I find that it's a bit

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.370 
as you can see I find that it's a bit
like<00:01:14.430> they<00:01:14.820> can<00:01:15.030> run<00:01:15.240> here<00:01:15.630> and<00:01:15.930> it's<00:01:16.110> a<00:01:16.170> bit

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
like they can run here and it's a bit

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.580 
like they can run here and it's a bit
big<00:01:16.740> here<00:01:17.100> and<00:01:17.400> I've<00:01:18.180> got<00:01:18.420> no<00:01:18.720> not<00:01:19.170> much<00:01:19.350> of<00:01:19.500> a

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
big here and I've got no not much of a

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.650 
big here and I've got no not much of a
nose<00:01:19.740> bridge<00:01:20.070> power<00:01:20.340> I'm<00:01:20.880> currently<00:01:21.540> using

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:21.660 
nose bridge power I'm currently using

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:23.990 
nose bridge power I'm currently using
filler<00:01:22.259> so<00:01:22.590> I<00:01:22.619> don't<00:01:22.830> want<00:01:22.950> to<00:01:23.130> depend<00:01:23.430> on<00:01:23.670> fill

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
filler so I don't want to depend on fill

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.300 
filler so I don't want to depend on fill
s<00:01:24.150> too<00:01:24.330> much<00:01:24.360> so<00:01:25.080> I<00:01:25.110> decided<00:01:25.350> to<00:01:25.979> do<00:01:26.280> a

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
s too much so I decided to do a

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.260 
s too much so I decided to do a
permanent<00:01:26.759> one<00:01:27.150> instead<00:01:27.530> yeah

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:29.270 
permanent one instead yeah

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.450 
permanent one instead yeah

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
in our clinic out of all the clinics in

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:39.350 
in our clinic out of all the clinics in
Korea<00:01:35.479> okay<00:01:36.479> as<00:01:36.660> I<00:01:36.900> mentioned<00:01:37.590> earlier<00:01:37.950> I<00:01:38.400> did

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
Korea okay as I mentioned earlier I did

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.330 
Korea okay as I mentioned earlier I did
a<00:01:39.390> lot<00:01:39.600> of<00:01:39.630> research<00:01:39.930> and<00:01:40.470> then<00:01:40.680> I<00:01:40.860> look<00:01:41.160> at<00:01:41.310> a

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
a lot of research and then I look at a

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.060 
a lot of research and then I look at a
lot<00:01:41.610> of<00:01:41.640> before<00:01:42.210> and<00:01:42.450> after<00:01:42.810> photos<00:01:43.200> and<00:01:43.650> I

lot of before and after photos and I
look<00:01:44.220> at<00:01:44.340> my<00:01:44.460> friends<00:01:44.790> results<00:01:45.240> and<00:01:45.390> I<00:01:45.479> thought

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
look at my friends results and I thought

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.600 
look at my friends results and I thought
that<00:01:46.220> this<00:01:47.220> clinic<00:01:47.569> JW<00:01:48.569> plastic<00:01:49.050> surgery<00:01:49.610> they

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
that this clinic JW plastic surgery they

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.249 
that this clinic JW plastic surgery they

00:01:57.559 --> 00:01:57.569 
photos are pretty beautiful so I decided

00:01:57.569 --> 00:02:13.860 
photos are pretty beautiful so I decided
to<00:01:57.810> choose<00:01:57.990> this<00:01:58.170> one<00:01:58.229> of<00:01:58.560> the<00:01:58.740> mini

00:03:34.869 --> 00:03:34.879 
bridge okay so your main concern is

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:42.400 
bridge okay so your main concern is
erasing<00:03:35.690> the<00:03:35.810> nasal<00:03:36.019> bridge<00:03:36.879> reduction<00:03:41.200> okay

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:42.410 
erasing the nasal bridge reduction okay

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:45.580 
erasing the nasal bridge reduction okay
I<00:03:42.680> mean<00:03:43.400> I<00:03:43.579> think<00:03:43.640> it's<00:03:43.970> okay<00:03:44.379> let's<00:03:45.379> take<00:03:45.530> a

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:45.590 
I mean I think it's okay let's take a

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:48.910 
I mean I think it's okay let's take a
look<00:03:45.829> at<00:03:46.040> your<00:03:46.370> pictures<00:03:47.319> you<00:03:48.319> said<00:03:48.650> your

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:48.920 
look at your pictures you said your

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:53.710 
look at your pictures you said your
nasal<00:03:49.160> bridge<00:03:49.810> nasal<00:03:50.810> ala<00:03:51.739> base<00:03:51.920> is<00:03:52.129> wide<00:03:52.720> but

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:53.720 
nasal bridge nasal ala base is wide but

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:58.000 
nasal bridge nasal ala base is wide but
I<00:03:54.650> do<00:03:55.190> not<00:03:55.340> think<00:03:55.519> it<00:03:55.760> is<00:03:55.940> very<00:03:56.299> much<00:03:56.750> wide<00:03:57.440> so

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.010 
I do not think it is very much wide so

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:01.270 
I do not think it is very much wide so
the<00:03:58.310> reduction<00:03:58.639> should<00:03:59.359> be<00:03:59.889> very<00:04:00.889> small

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:01.280 
the reduction should be very small

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:05.080 
the reduction should be very small
because<00:04:02.170> if<00:04:03.170> I<00:04:03.410> reduce<00:04:03.769> too<00:04:04.069> much<00:04:04.280> then<00:04:04.639> your

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:05.090 
because if I reduce too much then your

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:08.349 
because if I reduce too much then your
site<00:04:05.359> the<00:04:05.540> face<00:04:05.780> will<00:04:06.139> look<00:04:06.170> right<00:04:06.680> there<00:04:07.359> so

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:08.359
