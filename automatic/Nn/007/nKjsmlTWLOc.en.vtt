00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:42.969 
a philosophy on top of it exactly and I
noticed<00:01:41.880> on<00:01:41.939> the<00:01:42.060> back<00:01:42.240> there's<00:01:42.540> a<00:01:42.600> little

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:42.979 
noticed on the back there's a little

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:45.230 
noticed on the back there's a little
insignia<00:01:43.979> here<00:01:44.340> that<00:01:44.520> says<00:01:44.670> Demeter<00:01:45.030> what

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
insignia here that says Demeter what

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.940 
insignia here that says Demeter what
does<00:01:45.329> that<00:01:45.420> mean<00:01:45.630> yes<00:01:45.840> so<00:01:46.110> Demeter<00:01:46.409> is<00:01:46.680> the

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
does that mean yes so Demeter is the

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.050 
does that mean yes so Demeter is the
certification<00:01:47.610> the<00:01:47.729> biodynamic

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
certification the biodynamic

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.030 
certification the biodynamic
certification<00:01:48.899> now<00:01:49.079> not<00:01:49.259> all<00:01:49.439> wires<00:01:49.680> will

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
certification now not all wires will

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.770 
certification now not all wires will
have<00:01:50.220> that<00:01:50.460> because<00:01:50.939> of<00:01:51.149> the<00:01:51.180> paperwork<00:01:51.630> in

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
have that because of the paperwork in

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.310 
have that because of the paperwork in
the<00:01:51.869> cost<00:01:52.079> and<00:01:53.060> but<00:01:54.060> Demeter's<00:01:54.509> actually<00:01:55.020> the

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
the cost and but Demeter's actually the

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.530 
the cost and but Demeter's actually the
Greek<00:01:55.530> goddess<00:01:55.860> of<00:01:56.100> the<00:01:56.369> harvest<00:01:56.579> oh<00:01:57.060> yeah

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
seasons there you go that's science so

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:06.529 
seasons there you go that's science so
what<00:02:05.280> are<00:02:05.369> we<00:02:05.429> gonna<00:02:05.579> see<00:02:05.759> so<00:02:06.060> if<00:02:06.149> you<00:02:06.240> see<00:02:06.420> the

what are we gonna see so if you see the
Demeter<00:02:06.780> certification<00:02:07.380> notice<00:02:07.799> a

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
Demeter certification notice a

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:10.550 
Demeter certification notice a
biodynamic<00:02:08.580> wine<00:02:08.940> through<00:02:09.899> and<00:02:10.019> through<00:02:10.229> from

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
biodynamic wine through and through from

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.940 
biodynamic wine through and through from
the<00:02:10.769> vineyard<00:02:10.950> into<00:02:11.340> the<00:02:11.459> cellar<00:02:11.670> and<00:02:12.709> but<00:02:13.709> you

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
the vineyard into the cellar and but you

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.040 
the vineyard into the cellar and but you
can<00:02:14.069> ask<00:02:14.250> to<00:02:14.430> become<00:02:14.819> some<00:02:15.629> won't<00:02:15.840> have<00:02:16.019> that

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
can ask to become some won't have that

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:17.390 
can ask to become some won't have that
on<00:02:16.260> the<00:02:16.319> label<00:02:16.410> well<00:02:16.890> it's<00:02:16.980> like<00:02:17.099> when<00:02:17.250> you<00:02:17.310> go

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
on the label well it's like when you go

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:18.800 
on the label well it's like when you go
to<00:02:17.459> the<00:02:17.580> farmers<00:02:17.879> market<00:02:17.910> and<00:02:18.510> they<00:02:18.629> have

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
to the farmers market and they have

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.380 
to the farmers market and they have
almost<00:02:19.200> organic<00:02:19.830> produce<00:02:20.310> where<00:02:20.760> the<00:02:21.209> only

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
almost organic produce where the only

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.059 
almost organic produce where the only
reason<00:02:21.780> why<00:02:21.870> they<00:02:22.049> can't<00:02:22.319> be<00:02:22.560> certified<00:02:22.950> or

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:23.069 
reason why they can't be certified or

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:23.990 
reason why they can't be certified or
again<00:02:23.220> I<00:02:23.250> guess<00:02:23.489> because<00:02:23.580> their<00:02:23.760> next-door

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
again I guess because their next-door

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.729 
again I guess because their next-door
neighbors<00:02:24.330> know<00:02:24.450> it's<00:02:24.959> like<00:02:25.019> exactly<00:02:25.440> like<00:02:25.650> a

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:25.739 
neighbors know it's like exactly like a

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:27.650 
neighbors know it's like exactly like a
thing<00:02:26.010> but<00:02:26.250> they're<00:02:26.400> basically<00:02:26.819> organic<00:02:27.360> so

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
thing but they're basically organic so

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.630 
thing but they're basically organic so
it's<00:02:28.019> that's<00:02:28.260> interesting<00:02:28.739> yeah<00:02:29.010> yes<00:02:29.370> and<00:02:29.549> one

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
it's that's interesting yeah yes and one

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.100 
it's that's interesting yeah yes and one
thing<00:02:29.819> so<00:02:30.299> when<00:02:30.510> you've<00:02:30.660> gone<00:02:30.840> to<00:02:31.049> the

thing so when you've gone to the

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:21.460 
the earth mm-hmm what I love about this
too<00:04:20.150> is<00:04:20.359> this<00:04:20.600> is<00:04:20.720> the<00:04:20.840> kind<00:04:21.019> of<00:04:21.079> wine<00:04:21.260> that<00:04:21.440> I

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:21.470 
too is this is the kind of wine that I

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:22.750 
too is this is the kind of wine that I
feel<00:04:21.709> like<00:04:21.859> you<00:04:21.949> could<00:04:22.100> just<00:04:22.190> sit<00:04:22.430> and<00:04:22.520> drink

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:22.760 
feel like you could just sit and drink

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:25.270 
feel like you could just sit and drink
all<00:04:23.030> day<00:04:23.060> it's<00:04:23.690> like<00:04:23.870> a<00:04:23.960> really<00:04:24.139> casual<00:04:24.710> ezy

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:25.280 
all day it's like a really casual ezy

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:27.879 
all day it's like a really casual ezy
yeah<00:04:25.550> it's<00:04:25.910> not<00:04:26.240> it's<00:04:26.720> not<00:04:26.840> super<00:04:27.350> dense<00:04:27.590> and

00:04:27.879 --> 00:04:27.889 
yeah it's not it's not super dense and

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:30.310 
yeah it's not it's not super dense and
thick<00:04:28.100> and<00:04:28.419> brambly<00:04:29.419> or<00:04:29.750> anything<00:04:30.110> like<00:04:30.139> that

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:30.320 
thick and brambly or anything like that

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:32.320 
thick and brambly or anything like that
right<00:04:30.770> but<00:04:31.220> it<00:04:31.310> still<00:04:31.490> has<00:04:31.580> some<00:04:31.760> complexity

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:32.330 
right but it still has some complexity

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:34.029 
right but it still has some complexity
so<00:04:32.510> I<00:04:32.570> think<00:04:32.660> it's<00:04:32.870> a<00:04:32.990> great<00:04:33.139> wine<00:04:33.710> for<00:04:33.949> the

00:04:34.029 --> 00:04:34.039 
so I think it's a great wine for the

00:04:34.039 --> 00:04:36.100 
so I think it's a great wine for the
dinner<00:04:34.190> table<00:04:34.580> as<00:04:34.669> well<00:04:34.750> okay<00:04:35.750> this<00:04:35.840> one<00:04:35.990> hold

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:51.879 
biodynamic when you taste this I think
just<00:04:49.250> the<00:04:49.789> the<00:04:50.270> earthiness<00:04:50.570> of<00:04:50.810> it<00:04:50.960> the

00:04:51.879 --> 00:04:51.889 
just the the earthiness of it the

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:54.300 
just the the earthiness of it the
minerality<00:04:52.280> the<00:04:52.820> pureness<00:04:53.090> of<00:04:53.330> that<00:04:53.510> and<00:04:53.870> how

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:54.310 
minerality the pureness of that and how

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:58.060 
minerality the pureness of that and how
how<00:04:55.310> much<00:04:55.520> that<00:04:55.700> comes<00:04:55.910> through<00:04:56.620> just<00:04:57.620> on<00:04:57.889> the

00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:58.070 
how much that comes through just on the

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:02.140 
how much that comes through just on the
aroma's<00:04:58.580> and<00:04:59.240> on<00:04:59.630> the<00:04:59.810> palate<00:05:00.669> just<00:05:01.669> so<00:05:01.940> nice
