stays on really is the best ink for this

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:16.120 
stays on really is the best ink for this
because<00:04:14.560> it<00:04:14.800> doesn't<00:04:15.069> bleed

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:16.130 
because it doesn't bleed

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:18.610 
because it doesn't bleed
I<00:04:16.480> don't<00:04:17.480> know<00:04:17.570> I<00:04:17.600> wouldn't<00:04:18.020> try<00:04:18.260> to<00:04:18.290> wash<00:04:18.590> it

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:18.620

in the washing machine or anything crazy
like<00:04:20.540> that<00:04:20.900> but<00:04:21.400> it<00:04:22.400> works<00:04:22.760> the<00:04:23.150> best<00:04:23.330> for

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:23.480 
like that but it works the best for

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:25.600

before<00:04:46.850> you<00:04:47.210> built<00:04:47.420> your<00:04:47.540> cookie<00:04:47.930> but<00:04:48.800> I

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:48.830 
before you built your cookie but I

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:50.500 
before you built your cookie but I
really<00:04:49.190> wanted<00:04:49.370> to<00:04:49.460> have<00:04:49.610> control<00:04:50.060> of<00:04:50.090> how

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:50.510 
really wanted to have control of how

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:52.630 
really wanted to have control of how
much<00:04:51.260> of<00:04:51.500> the<00:04:51.590> ribbon<00:04:51.860> was<00:04:51.980> gonna<00:04:52.220> hang<00:04:52.490> out

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:52.640

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:54.470 
and where exactly it was gonna end up

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:58.240 
and where exactly it was gonna end up
because<00:04:55.130> each<00:04:55.370> cookie<00:04:56.170> is<00:04:57.170> shaped<00:04:57.500> just<00:04:57.950> a

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:58.250 
because each cookie is shaped just a

00:04:58.250 --> 00:04:59.800 
because each cookie is shaped just a
little<00:04:58.490> bit<00:04:58.610> different<00:04:59.000> than<00:04:59.150> the<00:04:59.300> next<00:04:59.660> as

00:04:59.800 --> 00:04:59.810 
little bit different than the next as
