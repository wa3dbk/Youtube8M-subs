00:00:07.839 --> 00:00:07.849 
no can you see the process of

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:15.900 
no can you see the process of
globalization<00:00:12.910> process<00:00:13.910> go<00:00:14.299> without<00:00:14.599> yeah

before<00:00:16.910> it<00:00:17.030> was<00:00:17.090> one<00:00:17.390> of<00:00:17.420> the<00:00:17.539> key<00:00:17.690> factors<00:00:17.720> in

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:18.110 
before it was one of the key factors in

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:19.720 
before it was one of the key factors in
making<00:00:18.440> shoes<00:00:18.860> where<00:00:19.070> you<00:00:19.190> shouldn't<00:00:19.520> shoot

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:24.020 
market shopping now a shot is good

market shopping now a shot is good
internet<00:00:24.400> won't<00:00:25.780> easily<00:00:26.780> we've<00:00:27.320> got<00:00:27.500> a<00:00:27.530> shop

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:27.890 
internet won't easily we've got a shop

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:30.640 
internet won't easily we've got a shop
go<00:00:28.250> to<00:00:28.310> show<00:00:28.580> me<00:00:28.640> any<00:00:29.180> circumstances<00:00:29.990> yeah<00:00:30.320> so

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:30.650 
go to show me any circumstances yeah so

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:32.170 
go to show me any circumstances yeah so
now<00:00:30.830> you're<00:00:31.070> going<00:00:31.280> to<00:00:31.370> end<00:00:31.520> up<00:00:31.670> with<00:00:31.790> a<00:00:31.910> long

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:32.180 
now you're going to end up with a long

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:36.090 
now you're going to end up with a long
list<00:00:32.829> and<00:00:33.829> it's<00:00:33.950> going<00:00:34.160> to<00:00:34.250> become<00:00:34.399> a<00:00:34.940> matrix

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:36.100 
list and it's going to become a matrix

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:40.329 
list and it's going to become a matrix
of<00:00:37.269> reasons<00:00:38.269> i<00:00:38.390> shot<00:00:38.660> the<00:00:39.019> factor<00:00:39.890> between<00:00:40.070> the

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:40.339 
of reasons i shot the factor between the

00:00:40.339 --> 00:00:42.160 
of reasons i shot the factor between the
shadow<00:00:40.579> of<00:00:40.940> my<00:00:41.179> factors<00:00:41.659> which<00:00:41.839> make<00:00:42.019> when

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:42.170 
shadow of my factors which make when

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:44.079 
shadow of my factors which make when
they<00:00:42.289> probably<00:00:42.649> will<00:00:42.920> change<00:00:43.370> and<00:00:43.609> then

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:44.089 
they probably will change and then

00:00:44.089 --> 00:00:45.549 
they probably will change and then
you're<00:00:44.269> going<00:00:44.390> to<00:00:44.449> see<00:00:44.659> if<00:00:44.719> they're<00:00:44.960> a<00:00:44.989> common

00:00:45.549 --> 00:00:45.559 
you're going to see if they're a common

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:49.689 
you're going to see if they're a common
factors<00:00:46.070> as<00:00:46.190> well<00:00:46.219> as<00:00:46.489> key<00:00:47.140> you<00:00:48.140> see<00:00:48.199> that<00:00:48.699> so

00:00:49.689 --> 00:00:49.699 
factors as well as key you see that so

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:52.739 
factors as well as key you see that so
there<00:00:50.089> might<00:00:50.179> be<00:00:50.239> price<00:00:50.659> price<00:00:51.469> and<00:00:52.010> not<00:00:52.039> less

00:00:59.439 --> 00:00:59.449 
sure they're like the common factor

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:00.939 
sure they're like the common factor
within<00:00:59.839> each<00:01:00.050> of<00:01:00.229> these<00:01:00.319> there<00:01:00.530> might<00:01:00.649> be<00:01:00.679> two

00:01:00.939 --> 00:01:00.949 
within each of these there might be two

output<00:02:09.879> in<00:02:10.030> an<00:02:10.119> outcome<00:02:11.160> so<00:02:12.160> you're<00:02:12.400> seeing

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
output in an outcome so you're seeing

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.000 
output in an outcome so you're seeing
something<00:02:13.180> and<00:02:13.540> you're<00:02:13.599> thinking<00:02:13.890> when<00:02:14.890> we

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
something and you're thinking when we

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.009 
something and you're thinking when we
need<00:02:15.280> to<00:02:15.489> direct<00:02:15.879> this<00:02:16.060> now<00:02:16.299> we<00:02:16.540> need<00:02:16.690> to<00:02:16.720> get

00:02:17.009 --> 00:02:17.019 
need to direct this now we need to get

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:18.900 
need to direct this now we need to get
an<00:02:17.200> outcome<00:02:17.379> from<00:02:17.769> this<00:02:17.829> bit<00:02:18.160> of<00:02:18.310> poster<00:02:18.760> than

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
an outcome from this bit of poster than

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:22.110 
an outcome from this bit of poster than
this<00:02:19.000> task<00:02:19.299> and<00:02:19.690> you<00:02:20.129> think<00:02:21.129> well<00:02:21.700> I<00:02:21.760> know<00:02:21.879> what

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
this task and you think well I know what

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.629 
this task and you think well I know what
I<00:02:22.269> want<00:02:22.510> to<00:02:22.629> do<00:02:22.950> but<00:02:23.950> you<00:02:24.069> can't<00:02:24.280> just<00:02:24.489> say

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:24.639 
I want to do but you can't just say

00:02:24.639 --> 00:02:26.879 
I want to do but you can't just say
right<00:02:24.880> get<00:02:25.780> post-its<00:02:26.290> how<00:02:26.410> would<00:02:26.620> you<00:02:26.709> all

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:26.889 
right get post-its how would you all

00:02:26.889 --> 00:02:30.949 
right get post-its how would you all
start<00:02:27.250> writing<00:02:27.609> on<00:02:27.790> them<00:02:28.049> people<00:02:29.049> won't<00:02:29.170> do<00:02:29.380> it

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
start writing on them people won't do it

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:34.500 
start writing on them people won't do it
they<00:02:31.959> will<00:02:32.170> just<00:02:32.739> freak<00:02:33.510> particularly

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
they will just freak particularly

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:38.580 
they will just freak particularly
dysfunctional<00:02:35.019> groups<00:02:37.079> so<00:02:38.079> what<00:02:38.230> you<00:02:38.319> have<00:02:38.349> to

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
dysfunctional groups so what you have to

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:41.160 
dysfunctional groups so what you have to
do<00:02:38.709> is<00:02:38.799> you<00:02:38.889> have<00:02:39.010> to<00:02:39.130> take<00:02:39.340> the<00:02:39.519> red<00:02:39.870> the<00:02:40.870> point

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
do is you have to take the red the point

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:43.589 
do is you have to take the red the point
at<00:02:41.349> which<00:02:41.440> you're<00:02:41.680> at<00:02:42.030> describe<00:02:43.030> that<00:02:43.269> point

00:02:43.589 --> 00:02:43.599 
at which you're at describe that point

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:47.729 
at which you're at describe that point
at<00:02:43.750> which<00:02:43.840> you're<00:02:44.049> at<00:02:45.959> then<00:02:46.959> make<00:02:47.200> your<00:02:47.349> green

00:02:47.729 --> 00:02:47.739 
at which you're at then make your green

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:49.710 
at which you're at then make your green
proposal<00:02:48.459> with<00:02:48.579> your<00:02:48.700> tool<00:02:48.970> technique<00:02:49.540> or

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
proposal with your tool technique or

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:52.500 
proposal with your tool technique or
model<00:02:50.079> and<00:02:50.489> then<00:02:51.489> go<00:02:51.669> back<00:02:51.700> to<00:02:51.849> read<00:02:52.150> and<00:02:52.329> say

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
model and then go back to read and say

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:54.420 
model and then go back to read and say
and<00:02:53.079> as<00:02:53.319> a<00:02:53.380> result<00:02:53.530> of<00:02:53.799> that<00:02:53.859> I<00:02:54.010> think<00:02:54.310> there's

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
and as a result of that I think there's

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:55.949 
and as a result of that I think there's
a<00:02:54.489> likelihood<00:02:54.819> we'll<00:02:55.090> do<00:02:55.239> build<00:02:55.510> will<00:02:55.690> get<00:02:55.840> to

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:55.959 
a likelihood we'll do build will get to

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:58.890 
a likelihood we'll do build will get to
there<00:02:56.139> and<00:02:56.950> as<00:02:57.639> you<00:02:57.790> saw<00:02:58.000> very<00:02:58.299> early<00:02:58.569> this

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:01.389 
morning when I did it I'm nitwit we need

00:03:01.389 --> 00:03:02.849 
morning when I did it I'm nitwit we need
to<00:03:01.480> move<00:03:01.630> from<00:03:01.840> tables<00:03:02.230> around<00:03:02.349> before<00:03:02.680> you

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:02.859 
to move from tables around before you

00:03:02.859 --> 00:03:04.050 
to move from tables around before you
came<00:03:03.010> in<00:03:03.190> John<00:03:03.340> there<00:03:03.459> was<00:03:03.489> a<00:03:03.579> moving<00:03:03.849> of

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
came in John there was a moving of

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.059 
came in John there was a moving of
tables<00:03:04.510> and<00:03:04.690> and<00:03:05.019> I<00:03:05.200> completely<00:03:05.650> screwed<00:03:05.799> up

00:03:06.059 --> 00:03:06.069 
tables and and I completely screwed up

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:07.920 
tables and and I completely screwed up
but<00:03:06.160> I<00:03:06.220> said<00:03:06.400> we<00:03:06.730> need<00:03:06.940> to<00:03:06.970> leave<00:03:07.239> poor<00:03:07.569> pat
