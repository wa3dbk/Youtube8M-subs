00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:04.410

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:07.250
 you 

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:13.490
 you 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:15.320
 hello youtubers ministries welcome 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:18.470
 to the channel of its pacifics in this 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:21.170
 I bring you a review of the 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:24.349
 products that I use for my curls 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:27.860
 The brand Kia moisture is a brand of 

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:31.279
 usa and I use this brand two 

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:34.460
 products that have become complement 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:36.770
 ideal for the care of my hair are 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:39.530
 these two the first one that I'm going to 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:42.680
 speak is the core hayes inÃ©s murphy that 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:44.329
 I use as my cream to comb you 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:47.090
 have been able to watch some videos in the 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:52.090
 which do you think I mention it is a 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:55.309
 creamy consistency and it's not so 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:01:01.000
 slidable because this cream gives a level 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:01:04.180
 of fixation and slight defines you the curl very 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.430
 but the level of fixation is slight 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:08.650
 so if you want a hairstyle 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:11.530
 with a strong fixation so install the 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:13.690
 cream for you however I what 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:15.040
 I do is that when I'm like this I do not 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:18.550
 I want my hair very loaded 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:20.320
 only I applied this cream ides and 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:22.630
 If I already want a hairstyle more 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:24.910
 structured that stay more than I'm going 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:26.740
 to be a long time on the street 

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:27.880
 then he complemented it with the other 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:31.330
 the other product that I am going to show you 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:33.820
 now the core james and has as 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:36.009
 main ingredient the coconut oil 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:37.930
 that you know that this oil is 

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:41.050
 spectacular for the hair as well as 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:44.530
 Other natural oils have protein 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:47.210
 of silk and has oil denim those are 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:51.590
 as the basic ingredients 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:52.970
 for for this chia cream 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.430
 as I told them the coconut oil says 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:58.369
 moisturizes protects hair against 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:00.979
 heat and chemical damage protein 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:04.130
 silk that reduces breakage strengthens the 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:05.720
 hair gives smoothness and silkiness and 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:08.989
 Neem oil which is an oil 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:11.870
 ancient Ayurveda that reinforces 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:14.260
 hair and provides bridge 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:17.049
 what promises 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:20.909
 he covers well he is very well he promises 

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:22.700
 hydration body and shine meets it 

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:25.420
 totally 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:28.910
 really the hair from a softness 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:32.660
 since using them is a product 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:35.239
 spectacular I really love him and what 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:37.080
 Would buy again with closed eyes if 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:41.190
 they have the opportunity 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:44.220
 to order products in the USA buy this 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:46.230
 product closed eyes because I love 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:50.100
 It really is very favorable for our 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:54.690
 hair the second product is the core 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:57.630
 insufle also said that I tell them with 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:59.760
 this product at the beginning when the 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:03.750
 first time I used it I did not like it 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:07.610
 it seemed too sticky not 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:09.680
 I keep my hair too much and that 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:11.540
 but well I said let's give it another 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:13.730
 opportunity let's see is going to try 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:16.910
 other techniques these looking at some 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:18.890
 videos of women in the usa what form 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:22.160
 they use there are opinions found some 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:25.630
 they like others not so much but good 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:30.350
 finally I found the proportion 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:32.420
 ideal now I love this I use it is 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:37.370
 as a kind of gel you can 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:40.280
 see and it's a lot like flaxseed 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:43.990
 because it's really made with seeds 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:43.990
 of flaxseed then 

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:49.780
 gives a medium fixation level between 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:52.330
 medium and high for your curls defines them 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:55.390
 it helps us to define very well and in 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:58.090
 set with the core jeans and gives a 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:04:00.040
 spectacular definition are the 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:01.870
 main components says that the 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:04.030
 oil as we all know the oil 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:06.070
 of coconut that moisturizes that protects that 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:09.370
 nourishes the hair that helps against 

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:12.400
 chemical damage the agave nectar says 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:14.800
 that sugar biopolymers that happens 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:17.890
 Naturally they provide fixed body 

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:20.049
 and shine without silicone classifiers 

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:23.020
 chemicals or alcohol 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:26.650
 the linseed oil that is rich in 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:29.530
 Omega 3 essential fatty acids 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:31.660
 increases strength and growth 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:36.789
 healthy hair while giving you 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:42.250
 brightness then the same promises and 

00:04:36.789 --> 00:04:44.289
 meets the core insufle said moisture la 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:47.700
 truth is how I said before are 

00:04:44.289 --> 00:04:50.340
 natural products have as 

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:52.800
 as the main characteristic that does not 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:55.230

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:58.890

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:03.810
 animal ingredients do not use sulfates 

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:05.990
 lost this mark is ideal for our 

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:05.990
