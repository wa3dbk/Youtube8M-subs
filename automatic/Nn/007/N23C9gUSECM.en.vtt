gonna pick up the vibrations in your
instrument<00:00:35.579> I'll<00:00:36.180> show<00:00:36.360> you<00:00:36.420> how<00:00:36.540> it<00:00:36.660> works

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
instrument I'll show you how it works

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.100 
instrument I'll show you how it works
if<00:00:37.860> you<00:00:38.340> run<00:00:39.210> an<00:00:39.329> electric<00:00:39.629> current<00:00:39.809> through

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
if you run an electric current through

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.720 
if you run an electric current through
it<00:00:40.290> and<00:00:40.440> I'm<00:00:40.500> just<00:00:40.530> gonna<00:00:40.680> use<00:00:40.800> a<00:00:40.950> little<00:00:41.250> three

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
it and I'm just gonna use a little three

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.389 
it and I'm just gonna use a little three
volt<00:00:41.969> battery<00:00:43.340> it<00:00:44.340> makes<00:00:44.579> a<00:00:44.670> beeping<00:00:44.820> sound

00:00:46.389 --> 00:00:46.399 
volt battery it makes a beeping sound

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:48.529 
volt battery it makes a beeping sound
alright<00:00:47.399> you<00:00:47.700> run<00:00:47.820> an<00:00:47.940> electric<00:00:48.239> current

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
alright you run an electric current

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.360 
alright you run an electric current
through<00:00:48.660> it<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:49.469> insides<00:00:49.829> vibrate<00:00:50.250> that

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
through it the insides vibrate that

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.090 
through it the insides vibrate that
makes<00:00:50.550> a<00:00:50.640> sound<00:00:51.199> the<00:00:52.199> neat<00:00:52.350> thing<00:00:52.559> about<00:00:52.590> it<00:00:52.829> is

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
makes a sound the neat thing about it is

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.010 
makes a sound the neat thing about it is
if<00:00:53.370> you<00:00:53.430> run<00:00:53.670> it<00:00:53.820> backwards<00:00:54.090> that<00:00:54.539> is<00:00:54.600> if<00:00:54.840> I

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
if you run it backwards that is if I

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.069 
if you run it backwards that is if I
vibrate<00:00:55.980> it<00:00:56.129> it<00:00:56.940> creates<00:00:57.420> an<00:00:57.660> electric

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
vibrate it it creates an electric

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.930 
vibrate it it creates an electric
current<00:00:58.410> and<00:00:58.620> then<00:00:59.160> we<00:00:59.309> can<00:00:59.460> harness<00:00:59.699> that

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
current and then we can harness that

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:00.979 
current and then we can harness that
electric<00:01:00.239> current<00:01:00.449> run<00:01:00.629> it<00:01:00.719> through<00:01:00.840> an

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
electric current run it through an

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.200 
electric current run it through an
amplifier<00:01:01.109> or<00:01:01.590> our<00:01:01.710> speaker<00:01:02.129> and<00:01:02.250> you<00:01:03.059> can

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
amplifier or our speaker and you can

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.870 
amplifier or our speaker and you can
Electrify<00:01:03.539> our<00:01:03.809> ukulele<00:01:04.320> or<00:01:04.409> guitar<00:01:05.100> or<00:01:05.159> I'll

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
Electrify our ukulele or guitar or I'll

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.280 
Electrify our ukulele or guitar or I'll
show<00:01:06.060> you<00:01:06.119> what<00:01:06.240> I'm<00:01:06.330> gonna<00:01:06.450> use<00:01:06.540> it<00:01:06.810> on<00:01:06.900> in<00:01:07.140> a

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:00.410 
tip the black wire is on the the middle
middle<00:01:58.259> so<00:01:59.219> I've<00:01:59.670> got<00:01:59.880> a<00:01:59.909> little<00:02:00.090> guitar

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
middle so I've got a little guitar

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.899 
middle so I've got a little guitar
amplifier<00:02:01.430> I'm<00:02:02.430> gonna<00:02:02.579> see<00:02:02.729> if<00:02:02.820> it<00:02:02.880> works

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
amplifier I'm gonna see if it works

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:06.260 
amplifier I'm gonna see if it works
let's<00:02:03.390> just<00:02:03.899> try<00:02:04.049> plugging<00:02:04.229> it<00:02:04.469> in<00:02:04.590> I<00:02:05.270> should

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
let's just try plugging it in I should

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.780 
let's just try plugging it in I should
be<00:02:06.659> able<00:02:06.719> to<00:02:06.810> just<00:02:06.990> tap<00:02:07.200> on<00:02:07.350> it

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:10.790 

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:17.600 

scratch<00:02:11.790> it<00:02:15.500> so<00:02:16.500> it<00:02:16.860> works<00:02:16.950> fine<00:02:17.190> this<00:02:17.340> wired

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
scratch it so it works fine this wired

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.570 
scratch it so it works fine this wired

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:53.660 
bit of putty and stick it together okay

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:56.930

so<00:03:54.660> with<00:03:55.019> just<00:03:55.049> a<00:03:55.440> little<00:03:55.620> bit<00:03:55.769> of<00:03:56.040> that<00:03:56.190> kind

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940 
so with just a little bit of that kind

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:58.670 
so with just a little bit of that kind
of<00:03:57.060> blue<00:03:57.209> putty<00:03:57.480> used<00:03:57.840> to<00:03:57.959> stick<00:03:58.139> posters<00:03:58.350> on

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
the wall and your dorm room you or I

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:05.030 
the wall and your dorm room you or I
just<00:04:02.209> stuck<00:04:03.209> it<00:04:03.329> right<00:04:03.510> about<00:04:03.959> there<00:04:04.019> on<00:04:04.829> the

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
just stuck it right about there on the

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.220 
just stuck it right about there on the
inside<00:04:05.340> of<00:04:05.519> the<00:04:05.730> lid<00:04:05.880> so<00:04:06.630> I'm<00:04:06.840> gonna<00:04:06.989> try

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230 
inside of the lid so I'm gonna try

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:31.189 
inside of the lid so I'm gonna try
plugging<00:04:07.500> it<00:04:07.739> in

00:04:31.189 --> 00:04:31.199 

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:35.000 

cool<00:04:32.199> it<00:04:32.440> works<00:04:32.710> I<00:04:33.060> guess<00:04:34.060> I'll<00:04:34.210> just<00:04:34.240> have<00:04:34.449> to

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:35.010 
cool it works I guess I'll just have to

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:38.300 
cool it works I guess I'll just have to
fry<00:04:36.010> it<00:04:36.070> up<00:04:36.190> I'm<00:04:36.370> gonna<00:04:36.520> keep<00:04:36.669> jamming<00:04:37.270> on<00:04:37.360> it

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:38.310 
fry it up I'm gonna keep jamming on it

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:41.360 
fry it up I'm gonna keep jamming on it
this<00:04:39.310> worked<00:04:39.520> actually<00:04:39.669> surprisingly<00:04:40.240> well

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:41.370 
this worked actually surprisingly well

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:44.040 
this worked actually surprisingly well
so<00:04:42.370> I<00:04:42.639> highly<00:04:43.389> recommend<00:04:43.419> giving<00:04:43.720> this<00:04:43.900> a<00:04:44.020> try

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:44.050 
so I highly recommend giving this a try

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:46.770 
so I highly recommend giving this a try
it's<00:04:44.919> cheap<00:04:45.340> it's<00:04:45.970> easy<00:04:46.240> you<00:04:46.449> don't<00:04:46.540> need<00:04:46.660> a

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:46.780 
it's cheap it's easy you don't need a

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:48.600 
it's cheap it's easy you don't need a
whole<00:04:46.960> lot<00:04:47.139> of<00:04:47.169> tools<00:04:47.440> or<00:04:47.740> special<00:04:48.070> equipment
