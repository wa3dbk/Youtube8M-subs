00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
doesn't seem to be one to work for me

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:54.760 
doesn't seem to be one to work for me
right<00:02:53.390> now<00:02:53.420> but<00:02:53.720> yeah<00:02:54.020> you<00:02:54.260> can<00:02:54.290> check<00:02:54.740> that

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:54.770 
right now but yeah you can check that

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:56.770 
right now but yeah you can check that
out<00:02:54.980> if<00:02:55.040> your<00:02:55.250> have<00:02:56.060> this<00:02:56.210> on<00:02:56.360> your<00:02:56.480> device<00:02:56.750> you

out if your have this on your device you

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.200 
out if your have this on your device you
have<00:02:57.050> your<00:02:57.550> killing<00:02:58.550> all<00:02:58.700> running<00:02:59.060> apps

00:02:59.200 --> 00:02:59.210 
have your killing all running apps

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:01.780 
have your killing all running apps
button<00:02:59.900> so<00:03:00.290> you<00:03:00.350> can<00:03:00.470> do<00:03:00.560> that<00:03:00.710> you<00:03:01.550> can<00:03:01.580> have

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:04.190 
your respring button and here this does

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:06.190 
your respring button and here this does
not<00:03:04.220> work<00:03:04.460> for<00:03:04.520> me<00:03:04.700> I<00:03:05.060> believe<00:03:05.810> that's<00:03:06.050> a

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:14.000 
named to be which is just over there I

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.050 
named to be which is just over there I
should<00:04:14.480> say<00:04:14.510> like<00:04:14.930> AT&amp;T<00:04:15.410> Verizon<00:04:16.400> I<00:04:16.730> don't

should say like AT&amp;T Verizon I don't

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:19.060 
should say like AT&amp;T Verizon I don't
know<00:04:17.120> Rogers<00:04:17.570> Bell<00:04:17.930> whatever<00:04:18.440> carrier<00:04:18.799> run

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:19.070 
know Rogers Bell whatever carrier run

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:21.370 
know Rogers Bell whatever carrier run
you<00:04:19.580> can<00:04:19.820> change<00:04:20.090> that<00:04:20.330> if<00:04:20.390> you<00:04:20.780> want<00:04:21.080> if<00:04:21.290> it

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:21.380 
you can change that if you want if it

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:21.920 
you can change that if you want if it
doesn't<00:04:21.590> work

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:21.930 
doesn't work

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:23.330 
doesn't work
then<00:04:22.019> again<00:04:22.139> it's<00:04:22.470> just<00:04:22.590> because<00:04:22.889> as<00:04:23.039> a<00:04:23.070> beta

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:23.340 
then again it's just because as a beta

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.490 
then again it's just because as a beta
so<00:04:24.240> that's<00:04:24.360> probably<00:04:24.539> why<00:04:24.810> you<00:04:24.870> can<00:04:25.110> tap<00:04:25.259> Done

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:25.500 
so that's probably why you can tap Done

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:27.469 
so that's probably why you can tap Done
and<00:04:25.770> then<00:04:25.860> it<00:04:26.039> should<00:04:26.370> either<00:04:26.639> change<00:04:27.180> or<00:04:27.389> you

00:04:27.469 --> 00:04:27.479 
and then it should either change or you

00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:29.629 
and then it should either change or you
need<00:04:27.630> to<00:04:27.720> respring<00:04:28.199> for<00:04:29.009> that<00:04:29.130> to<00:04:29.250> work<00:04:29.280> but

00:04:29.629 --> 00:04:29.639 
need to respring for that to work but

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:31.340 
need to respring for that to work but
again<00:04:29.910> on<00:04:30.120> an<00:04:30.300> ipod<00:04:30.570> touch<00:04:30.780> 4th<00:04:31.080> generation
