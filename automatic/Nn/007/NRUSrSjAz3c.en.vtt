00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:22.830 
and I just think that people should get
into<00:02:21.610> it<00:02:21.640> cause<00:02:21.790> it's<00:02:21.970> such<00:02:22.209> a<00:02:22.239> different

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
into it cause it's such a different

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.509 
into it cause it's such a different
thing<00:02:22.870> to<00:02:23.050> be<00:02:23.230> able<00:02:23.319> to<00:02:23.440> do<00:02:23.680> like<00:02:24.040> it's<00:02:24.220> not<00:02:24.400> the

00:02:24.509 --> 00:02:24.519 
thing to be able to do like it's not the

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:26.100
