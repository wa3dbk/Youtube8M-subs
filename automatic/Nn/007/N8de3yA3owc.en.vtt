00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:15.019
 little girl who does not want to talk but 

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:17.210
 she says she was a little nervous but 

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:19.830
 well let's make it talk a little like that 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:22.150

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.449

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:30.370
 a little 

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:33.640
 of sleep because it's too late over there 

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:36.910

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:39.580

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:45.880
 make a series a series and we're 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:48.640
 thinking about doing it on the east map of 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:51.129
 10 minutes but it's also a bit 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:52.690
 spent that but partly for that 

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:55.270
 there is also a video to see if you 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:58.330

00:00:55.270 --> 00:01:02.610

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:02.610

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:11.770

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:15.160

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:16.990

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:19.570
 there are some comments for us to see 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:21.820
 and search there to see the map and everything 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:24.369
 but that if they hear a 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:25.720
 sexy voice every day then passes the 

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:29.500

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:31.240

 what is the bad 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:42.130

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:44.440

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:47.080

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:11.530
