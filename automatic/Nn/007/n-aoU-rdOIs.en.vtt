00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:05.899
 Well well you can appreciate the 

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:08.890
 snow 

00:00:05.899 --> 00:00:11.920
 back in 

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:13.840
 what can you say the yard we 're going 

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:16.840
 accumulated about 30 

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:20.020
 centimeters here we can see is not 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:22.570
 exaggeration but good in that god 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:25.270
 we are alive here we are this is not 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:27.640
 nothing of the other world to compare it with 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:33.990
 other damage as elevated because it was 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:33.990
 very little this but well this is the most 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:39.760
 a video for all the people who have never 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:42.930
 come here the us and for the people that 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:45.880
 think come, think about how well you 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:49.870
 it's all in winter summer is very 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:52.629
 Very beautiful cute to go for a walk 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:54.969
 but in winter not much then all for 

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:59.019
 cold and where it goes it gets very difficult 

00:00:54.969 --> 00:01:02.780
 to handle but good for you to have a 

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:04.589
 idea well I'm showing 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:08.409
 how 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:11.110
 you look at the snow 

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:13.300
 and the weather as they put 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:18.030
 in these days that it is snowing we are 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:18.030
 on the second day of January 2014 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:28.659
 there is nothing left but to clean the door 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:32.710
 where good one lives 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:35.100
 so they do not give you fines after a while for not 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:35.100
 clean 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.450
 and I imagine that there were many people 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:44.549
 that we would like to be here but 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.110
 well I guess that business does not 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:49.630
 they can come on vacation but for 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:52.420
 live good who knows 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:54.950
 when I tell you if you look at the 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:58.020
 City of Chicago 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:59.940
 and visibility is not much 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:03.880
 by 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:06.170
 snow that is falling a little thick 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:08.119
 but good 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:12.140
 I do not tell you 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:14.670
 that's the way life is for us to complain 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.410
 we are alive thanks 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.840
 you have to make you want to live for 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:21.769
 forward not back 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.769
 why 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:28.400
 this video is for all the people who do not 

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:30.170
 we have come to the us and to those who 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.670
 we are here we already know how is the 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:34.550
 winter here in the united states to 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:37.510
 regret that in certain states of this 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:40.209
 country has not snowed yet 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:42.250
 the new I believe and some other states 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:44.340
 but good and the storm goes there 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:48.019
 on my way 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:48.019
 we say so that you have an idea 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:06.770
 and so you have to go to work nobody 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:09.640
 forgive nothing that you have to work and 

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:09.640
 work there is no other 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:15.130
 it's not like in our beautiful color that 

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:17.860
 there's nothing left and he does not want to go to 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:20.580
 work for laziness but good in 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:20.580
 that you have to work 

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:24.629

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:27.110
