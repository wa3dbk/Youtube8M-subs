types pull beans and yard-long bean I

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.340 
types pull beans and yard-long bean I
tried<00:00:31.679> this<00:00:31.859> one<00:00:32.070> last<00:00:32.279> year<00:00:32.489> but<00:00:32.669> I<00:00:32.700> put<00:00:32.910> it<00:00:33.030> in

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:33.350 
tried this one last year but I put it in

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.520 
tried this one last year but I put it in
way<00:00:34.350> too<00:00:34.410> late<00:00:34.770> and<00:00:35.040> so<00:00:35.520> I'm<00:00:35.610> sort<00:00:36.000> of

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:36.530 
way too late and so I'm sort of

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:39.830 
way too late and so I'm sort of
interested<00:00:37.530> to<00:00:37.739> see<00:00:38.489> see<00:00:39.000> how<00:00:39.149> these<00:00:39.360> all<00:00:39.600> do

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
interested to see see how these all do

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.780 
interested to see see how these all do
now<00:00:40.260> I'm<00:00:40.379> up<00:00:40.530> in<00:00:40.620> Canada<00:00:41.100> here<00:00:41.280> in<00:00:41.460> case<00:00:41.640> you're

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
now I'm up in Canada here in case you're

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.670 
now I'm up in Canada here in case you're
wondering<00:00:41.910> why<00:00:42.180> on<00:00:42.329> earth<00:00:42.360> I'd<00:00:42.660> be<00:00:42.809> starting

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
wondering why on earth I'd be starting

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.170 
wondering why on earth I'd be starting
seeds<00:00:44.160> in<00:00:44.430> almost<00:00:45.300> June<00:00:45.690> now<00:00:46.550> but<00:00:47.550> this<00:00:48.000> is

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
seeds in almost June now but this is

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.139 
seeds in almost June now but this is
probably<00:00:48.360> a<00:00:48.570> little<00:00:48.600> bit<00:00:48.899> late<00:00:49.110> as<00:00:49.350> it<00:00:49.920> is

00:00:50.139 --> 00:00:50.149 
probably a little bit late as it is

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:52.610 
probably a little bit late as it is
but<00:00:51.149> I<00:00:51.449> can<00:00:51.690> certainly<00:00:51.840> get<00:00:52.110> away<00:00:52.289> with<00:00:52.469> it

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
but I can certainly get away with it

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.360 
but I can certainly get away with it
with<00:00:53.270> with<00:00:54.270> pole<00:00:54.539> beans<00:00:54.780> I'm<00:00:55.079> sure<00:00:55.350> and<00:00:55.649> I've

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
with with pole beans I'm sure and I've

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.970 
with with pole beans I'm sure and I've
have<00:00:56.879> quite<00:00:57.120> a<00:00:57.149> few<00:00:57.239> more<00:00:58.079> plants<00:00:58.440> that<00:00:58.710> I<00:00:58.800> need

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
have quite a few more plants that I need

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.240 
have quite a few more plants that I need
to<00:00:59.129> get<00:00:59.219> started<00:00:59.699> as<00:00:59.850> well<00:01:00.090> but<00:01:00.899> anyhow<00:01:01.530> so<00:01:02.160> I'm

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
to get started as well but anyhow so I'm

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.470

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
going to be making these little pots

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.130 
going to be making these little pots
these<00:01:04.229> are<00:01:04.650> little<00:01:05.070> paper<00:01:05.640> pots<00:01:06.060> they're<00:01:06.960> very

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
these are little paper pots they're very

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.210 
these are little paper pots they're very
very<00:01:07.350> handy<00:01:07.920> I<00:01:08.600> used<00:01:09.600> to<00:01:09.750> use<00:01:09.960> a<00:01:10.380> lot<00:01:10.890> of<00:01:10.920> peat

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
very handy I used to use a lot of peat

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.750 
very handy I used to use a lot of peat
pellets<00:01:11.479> and<00:01:12.479> I<00:01:12.689> love<00:01:12.900> peat<00:01:13.140> pellets<00:01:13.530> but<00:01:14.040> you

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
pellets and I love peat pellets but you

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.340 
pellets and I love peat pellets but you
know<00:01:14.880> the<00:01:15.000> fact<00:01:15.240> is<00:01:15.450> you<00:01:15.540> have<00:01:15.780> to<00:01:15.900> buy<00:01:16.080> them

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
know the fact is you have to buy them

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:17.899 
know the fact is you have to buy them
you<00:01:16.409> have<00:01:16.680> to<00:01:16.770> go<00:01:16.860> to<00:01:16.920> the<00:01:17.040> store<00:01:17.280> to<00:01:17.460> find<00:01:17.490> and

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
you have to go to the store to find and

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.660 
you have to go to the store to find and
find<00:01:18.299> stores<00:01:18.630> don't<00:01:18.869> really<00:01:19.049> carry<00:01:19.290> them<00:01:19.670> that

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
find stores don't really carry them that

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.090 
find stores don't really carry them that
much<00:01:20.939> really<00:01:21.240> this<00:01:21.810> is<00:01:22.259> not<00:01:22.530> as<00:01:22.650> much<00:01:22.680> as<00:01:22.979> they

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
much really this is not as much as they

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.510 
much really this is not as much as they
used<00:01:23.340> to<00:01:23.880> and<00:01:24.390> you<00:01:24.530> know<00:01:25.530> peat<00:01:25.770> moss<00:01:25.950> isn't<00:01:26.369> the

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
used to and you know peat moss isn't the

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.179 
used to and you know peat moss isn't the
most<00:01:26.700> sustainable<00:01:27.650> material<00:01:28.650> in<00:01:28.829> the<00:01:28.950> world

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
most sustainable material in the world

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:33.830 
most sustainable material in the world
so<00:01:29.640> I<00:01:30.140> try<00:01:31.140> to<00:01:31.759> use<00:01:32.759> alternatives<00:01:33.390> as<00:01:33.509> much<00:01:33.689> as

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
so I try to use alternatives as much as

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.230 
so I try to use alternatives as much as
possible<00:01:34.049> and<00:01:35.040> speaking<00:01:35.490> of<00:01:35.579> which<00:01:35.729> this

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240

watering<00:02:11.110> apparatus<00:02:11.680> aka<00:02:12.340> turkey<00:02:13.270> baster<00:02:13.720> and

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520 
watering apparatus aka turkey baster and

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:17.010 
watering apparatus aka turkey baster and
this<00:02:15.520> these<00:02:16.000> are<00:02:16.180> the<00:02:16.270> supplies<00:02:16.450> we've<00:02:16.870> got

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:17.020 
this these are the supplies we've got

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:21.720 
this these are the supplies we've got
here<00:02:17.200> I'm<00:02:17.920> using<00:02:18.220> a<00:02:18.850> old<00:02:20.160> postal<00:02:21.160> code<00:02:21.340> lookup

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
here I'm using a old postal code lookup

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:23.760 
here I'm using a old postal code lookup
I'm<00:02:21.910> up<00:02:22.030> in<00:02:22.150> Canada<00:02:22.630> as<00:02:22.810> I<00:02:23.110> think<00:02:23.170> I<00:02:23.350> mentioned

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:23.770 
I'm up in Canada as I think I mentioned

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:26.220 
I'm up in Canada as I think I mentioned
so<00:02:24.460> we<00:02:24.640> have<00:02:24.790> postal<00:02:25.240> codes<00:02:25.450> not<00:02:25.720> zip<00:02:25.990> codes

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
so we have postal codes not zip codes

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.080 
so we have postal codes not zip codes
and<00:02:26.440> this<00:02:27.040> is<00:02:27.220> like<00:02:27.370> a<00:02:27.400> telephone<00:02:27.910> book

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
and this is like a telephone book

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:30.690 
and this is like a telephone book

and<00:04:43.680> shove<00:04:43.860> it<00:04:43.889> in<00:04:44.100> a<00:04:44.160> little<00:04:44.400> bit<00:04:44.520> and<00:04:44.990> then

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:45.990 
and shove it in a little bit and then

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:50.540 
and shove it in a little bit and then
what<00:04:46.830> I<00:04:46.860> will<00:04:47.100> do<00:04:47.280> is<00:04:47.520> I'll<00:04:47.700> put<00:04:47.940> the<00:04:48.780> jar<00:04:49.550> like

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:50.550 
what I will do is I'll put the jar like

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:53.590 
what I will do is I'll put the jar like
this<00:04:50.610> put<00:04:51.120> it<00:04:51.240> on<00:04:51.330> the<00:04:51.419> ground<00:04:51.660> and<00:04:52.530> then<00:04:53.040> just

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:53.600 
this put it on the ground and then just

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:58.610 
this put it on the ground and then just
put<00:04:54.600> that<00:04:55.160> push<00:04:56.160> it<00:04:56.310> down<00:04:56.430> onto<00:04:56.669> the<00:04:56.910> table<00:04:57.620> and

00:04:58.610 --> 00:04:58.620 
put that push it down onto the table and

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:00.800 
put that push it down onto the table and
you<00:04:58.740> basically<00:04:58.950> formed<00:04:59.580> yourself<00:05:00.000> a<00:05:00.180> nice

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:00.810 
you basically formed yourself a nice

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:03.020 
you basically formed yourself a nice
little<00:05:01.139> bottom<00:05:01.650> there<00:05:01.860> now<00:05:02.310> this<00:05:02.490> is<00:05:02.669> finished

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:03.030
