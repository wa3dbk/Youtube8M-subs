first<00:02:54.730> unusable<00:02:59.040> part<00:03:00.040> of<00:03:00.130> me<00:03:00.250> thinks<00:03:00.280> that

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:00.850 
first unusable part of me thinks that

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:03.090 
first unusable part of me thinks that
maybe<00:03:01.209> the<00:03:01.690> odds<00:03:01.840> have<00:03:02.110> gone<00:03:02.290> up<00:03:02.470> a<00:03:02.560> little<00:03:02.950> bit

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:03.100 
maybe the odds have gone up a little bit

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.060 
maybe the odds have gone up a little bit
because<00:03:03.450> by<00:03:04.450> now<00:03:04.720> there<00:03:04.989> was<00:03:05.110> a<00:03:05.170> ton<00:03:05.620> of<00:03:05.650> x<00:03:05.890> and

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:06.070 
because by now there was a ton of x and

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:08.449 
because by now there was a ton of x and
y<00:03:06.190> shinies<00:03:06.670> and<00:03:06.910> i've<00:03:07.120> been<00:03:07.300> looking<00:03:07.450> and

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459 
y shinies and i've been looking and

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:10.890 
y shinies and i've been looking and
there<00:03:09.459> haven't<00:03:09.670> been<00:03:09.850> as<00:03:10.030> many<00:03:10.180> office<00:03:10.570> a<00:03:10.660> fire

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 
there haven't been as many office a fire

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.080 
there haven't been as many office a fire
on<00:03:11.260> the<00:03:11.320> groovy<00:03:11.709> shiner<00:03:11.950> so<00:03:12.310> maybe<00:03:12.850> it's<00:03:13.030> just

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090 
on the groovy shiner so maybe it's just

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:17.340 
on the groovy shiner so maybe it's just
a<00:03:13.300> luck<00:03:13.480> thing<00:03:15.600> honestly<00:03:16.600> it<00:03:16.989> could<00:03:17.230> be

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:17.350 
a luck thing honestly it could be

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:20.460 
a luck thing honestly it could be
possible<00:03:17.530> that<00:03:17.980> the<00:03:18.130> ozs<00:03:18.250> went<00:03:18.730> up<00:03:18.940> a<00:03:19.060> bit<00:03:19.470> but

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.470 
possible that the ozs went up a bit but

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:23.670 
possible that the ozs went up a bit but
after<00:03:20.620> four<00:03:21.370> encounters<00:03:21.730> I<00:03:22.239> doubt<00:03:23.200> it<00:03:23.230> anyway

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680 
after four encounters I doubt it anyway

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.360 
after four encounters I doubt it anyway
I'm<00:03:23.739> going<00:03:23.860> to<00:03:23.950> use<00:03:24.100> the<00:03:24.190> master<00:03:24.459> bath<00:03:24.640> I<00:03:26.370> think
