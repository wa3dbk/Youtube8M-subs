00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:56.990 
but the movie had none of that shit well
I<00:00:55.410> guess<00:00:55.590> some<00:00:55.739> bison<00:00:56.129> did<00:00:56.250> his<00:00:56.430> little<00:00:56.610> flying

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
I guess some bison did his little flying

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.970 
I guess some bison did his little flying
move<00:00:57.270> but<00:00:57.480> the<00:00:57.570> nigga<00:00:57.750> wasn't<00:00:58.109> glowing<00:00:58.469> and<00:00:58.680> I

move but the nigga wasn't glowing and I

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.400 
move but the nigga wasn't glowing and I
guess<00:00:59.190> guile<00:00:59.520> did<00:01:00.000> a<00:01:00.030> move<00:01:00.300> that<00:01:00.570> kind<00:01:00.989> of<00:01:01.230> look

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
guess guile did a move that kind of look

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.500

nations<00:03:50.070> I<00:03:50.310> guess<00:03:50.520> it's<00:03:50.670> supposed<00:03:50.850> to<00:03:50.880> be<00:03:51.000> like

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
nations I guess it's supposed to be like

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.810 
nations I guess it's supposed to be like
the<00:03:51.330> United<00:03:51.900> Nations<00:03:52.130> similar<00:03:53.130> to<00:03:53.640> that<00:03:53.760> I

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:53.820 
the United Nations similar to that I

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:56.540 
the United Nations similar to that I
guess<00:03:54.270> maybe<00:03:55.170> they<00:03:55.380> had<00:03:55.530> that<00:03:55.800> trademarked

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:56.550 
guess maybe they had that trademarked

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:58.580 
guess maybe they had that trademarked
for<00:03:57.000> whatever<00:03:57.150> reason<00:03:57.690> he<00:03:58.050> wants<00:03:58.350> the<00:03:58.470> money

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
for whatever reason he wants the money

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:00.380 
for whatever reason he wants the money
so<00:03:58.830> he<00:03:58.860> could<00:03:59.100> fund<00:03:59.400> these<00:03:59.610> super<00:04:00.180> soldiers

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:00.390 
so he could fund these super soldiers

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:02.750 
so he could fund these super soldiers
and<00:04:01.050> his<00:04:01.290> idea<00:04:01.620> of<00:04:01.680> a<00:04:01.770> super<00:04:02.100> soldier<00:04:02.340> are

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 
and his idea of a super soldier are

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:05.000 
and his idea of a super soldier are
these<00:04:03.090> hulking<00:04:03.390> green<00:04:03.780> monsters<00:04:04.530> that<00:04:04.950> are

these hulking green monsters that are

is what they did with the Mortal Kombat
movie<00:06:47.750> which<00:06:48.110> is<00:06:48.140> probably<00:06:48.740> terrible<00:06:49.310> to<00:06:49.490> me

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:49.520 
movie which is probably terrible to me

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:52.000
