meets your farm goals so let's use an

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:10.710 
meets your farm goals so let's use an
example<00:01:08.110> here<00:01:08.710> let's<00:01:09.460> assume<00:01:09.700> that<00:01:09.970> it<00:01:10.360> is<00:01:10.660> a

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:10.720 
example here let's assume that it is a

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:14.219 
example here let's assume that it is a
herd<00:01:11.289> of<00:01:11.530> dairy<00:01:11.830> cows<00:01:12.190> and<00:01:12.640> there<00:01:13.479> are<00:01:13.600> 50<00:01:14.020> in

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:14.229 
herd of dairy cows and there are 50 in

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:17.639 
herd of dairy cows and there are 50 in
the<00:01:14.380> herd<00:01:14.679> and<00:01:15.179> this<00:01:16.179> farmers<00:01:16.660> goal<00:01:16.929> is<00:01:17.289> to

00:01:17.639 --> 00:01:17.649 
the herd and this farmers goal is to

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:20.880 
the herd and this farmers goal is to
provide<00:01:18.039> 30<00:01:18.940> pounds<00:01:19.479> of<00:01:19.630> dry<00:01:19.899> matter<00:01:19.929> per<00:01:20.619> cow

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:20.890 
provide 30 pounds of dry matter per cow

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:23.609 
provide 30 pounds of dry matter per cow
from<00:01:21.640> the<00:01:21.820> pasture<00:01:22.270> per<00:01:22.479> day<00:01:22.690> so<00:01:23.289> this<00:01:23.410> is<00:01:23.470> a

00:01:23.609 --> 00:01:23.619 
from the pasture per day so this is a

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:26.520 
from the pasture per day so this is a
farm<00:01:23.979> that's<00:01:24.369> providing<00:01:25.210> the<00:01:25.420> majority<00:01:26.110> of

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:26.530 
farm that's providing the majority of

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:28.950 
farm that's providing the majority of
the<00:01:26.770> dry<00:01:26.950> matter<00:01:27.220> from<00:01:28.000> pasture<00:01:28.570> and<00:01:28.810> they're

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:28.960 
the dry matter from pasture and they're

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:30.450 
the dry matter from pasture and they're
supplementing<00:01:29.470> just<00:01:29.649> a<00:01:29.740> little<00:01:29.979> bit<00:01:30.100> of<00:01:30.220> grain

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:30.460 
supplementing just a little bit of grain

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:33.300 
supplementing just a little bit of grain
in<00:01:30.729> the<00:01:30.850> barn<00:01:31.090> so<00:01:31.380> the<00:01:32.380> first<00:01:32.590> thing<00:01:32.830> we<00:01:33.130> need

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:33.310 
in the barn so the first thing we need

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:36.419 
in the barn so the first thing we need
to<00:01:33.340> do<00:01:33.640> is<00:01:34.119> determine<00:01:34.390> what<00:01:35.380> the<00:01:35.560> total<00:01:36.009> dry

00:01:36.419 --> 00:01:36.429 
to do is determine what the total dry

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:38.999 
to do is determine what the total dry
matter<00:01:36.670> requirement<00:01:37.420> is<00:01:37.570> of<00:01:37.929> the<00:01:38.289> herd<00:01:38.560> for<00:01:38.950> a

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:39.009 
matter requirement is of the herd for a

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:42.210 
matter requirement is of the herd for a
whole<00:01:39.220> day<00:01:39.660> so<00:01:40.660> I'll<00:01:41.200> use<00:01:41.410> my<00:01:41.560> calculator<00:01:42.099> and

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:42.220 
whole day so I'll use my calculator and

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:46.410 
whole day so I'll use my calculator and
I'll<00:01:42.520> take<00:01:42.759> the<00:01:43.229> 50<00:01:44.229> animals<00:01:44.729> times<00:01:45.729> the<00:01:46.149> 30

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:46.420 
I'll take the 50 animals times the 30

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:50.219 
I'll take the 50 animals times the 30
pounds<00:01:47.050> and<00:01:47.349> I<00:01:47.860> come<00:01:48.069> up<00:01:48.099> with<00:01:48.390> 1500<00:01:49.390> pounds<00:01:49.929> of

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:50.229 
pounds and I come up with 1500 pounds of

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:52.529 
pounds and I come up with 1500 pounds of
dry<00:01:50.739> matter<00:01:50.770> per<00:01:51.369> day<00:01:51.610> so<00:01:52.209> that's<00:01:52.300> the

00:01:52.529 --> 00:01:52.539 
dry matter per day so that's the

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:54.779 
dry matter per day so that's the
requirement<00:01:53.170> of<00:01:53.319> that<00:01:53.500> whole<00:01:53.770> 50<00:01:54.220> cow<00:01:54.399> herd

00:01:54.779 --> 00:01:54.789 
requirement of that whole 50 cow herd

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:58.229 
requirement of that whole 50 cow herd
from<00:01:55.209> pasture<00:01:55.780> the<00:01:56.739> next<00:01:57.039> thing<00:01:57.280> is<00:01:57.550> now<00:01:58.209> that

00:01:58.229 --> 00:01:58.239 
from pasture the next thing is now that

00:01:58.239 --> 00:02:00.359 
from pasture the next thing is now that
we've<00:01:58.569> already<00:01:58.869> used<00:01:59.289> this<00:01:59.470> grazing<00:02:00.009> stick

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:00.369 
we've already used this grazing stick

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:02.460 
we've already used this grazing stick
and<00:02:00.670> we've<00:02:01.030> gone<00:02:01.270> around<00:02:01.509> the<00:02:01.660> pasture<00:02:01.959> and

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:02.470 
and we've gone around the pasture and

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:05.880 
and we've gone around the pasture and
measured<00:02:03.310> how<00:02:03.910> much<00:02:04.179> available<00:02:04.560> raisable<00:02:05.560> dry

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:08.699 
measured how much available raisable dry
matter<00:02:06.160> is<00:02:06.459> available<00:02:06.970> in<00:02:07.090> a<00:02:07.179> whole<00:02:07.420> acre<00:02:07.810> and

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:08.709 
matter is available in a whole acre and

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:11.010 
matter is available in a whole acre and
we<00:02:08.830> we<00:02:09.160> came<00:02:09.369> up<00:02:09.489> with<00:02:09.670> the<00:02:09.759> number<00:02:10.030> 1200<00:02:10.810> in

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:11.020 
we we came up with the number 1200 in

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:13.890 
we we came up with the number 1200 in
our<00:02:11.590> example<00:02:12.069> that<00:02:12.190> we<00:02:12.250> did<00:02:12.400> before<00:02:12.550> and<00:02:13.209> so

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
our example that we did before and so

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.570 
our example that we did before and so
the<00:02:14.050> next<00:02:14.260> thing<00:02:14.500> that<00:02:14.530> we're<00:02:14.770> going<00:02:14.920> to<00:02:15.010> do<00:02:15.280> is

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
the next thing that we're going to do is

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:23.050 
the next thing that we're going to do is
divide<00:02:16.360> the<00:02:17.400> 1200<00:02:18.400> into<00:02:18.670> the<00:02:19.360> 1500

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.430 

and<00:02:23.180> so<00:02:24.020> we<00:02:24.170> get<00:02:24.819> 1.25<00:02:25.850> that's<00:02:26.420> an<00:02:26.569> acre<00:02:26.840> and<00:02:27.290> a

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
and so we get 1.25 that's an acre and a

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.890 
and so we get 1.25 that's an acre and a
quarter<00:02:27.890> is<00:02:28.430> how<00:02:28.760> much<00:02:28.970> you<00:02:29.120> need<00:02:29.300> in<00:02:29.510> order<00:02:29.630> to

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
quarter is how much you need in order to

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.590 
quarter is how much you need in order to
provide<00:02:30.170> the<00:02:30.680> 1,500<00:02:31.520> pounds<00:02:31.970> of<00:02:32.150> dry<00:02:32.360> matter

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:32.600 
provide the 1,500 pounds of dry matter

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:36.070 
provide the 1,500 pounds of dry matter
so<00:02:33.470> that<00:02:33.500> means<00:02:33.770> for<00:02:34.040> every<00:02:34.280> 24<00:02:35.060> hours<00:02:35.120> if

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.080 
so that means for every 24 hours if

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.140 
so that means for every 24 hours if
you're<00:02:36.260> putting<00:02:36.530> out<00:02:36.709> 24<00:02:37.220> hour<00:02:37.370> paddocks<00:02:37.910> that

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
you're putting out 24 hour paddocks that

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.479 
you're putting out 24 hour paddocks that
you<00:02:38.540> putting<00:02:38.780> your<00:02:38.840> animals<00:02:39.230> in<00:02:39.410> each<00:02:39.620> paddock

00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:40.489 
you putting your animals in each paddock

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:42.280 
you putting your animals in each paddock
would<00:02:40.640> need<00:02:40.790> to<00:02:40.910> be<00:02:41.060> an<00:02:41.270> acre<00:02:41.630> and<00:02:41.900> a<00:02:41.959> quarter

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290 
would need to be an acre and a quarter

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:44.680 
would need to be an acre and a quarter
in<00:02:42.470> size<00:02:42.770> so<00:02:43.700> that<00:02:43.730> each<00:02:44.060> paddock<00:02:44.569> is

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
in size so that each paddock is

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:46.930 
in size so that each paddock is
providing<00:02:45.110> the<00:02:45.230> 1,500<00:02:45.950> pounds<00:02:46.400> of<00:02:46.580> dry<00:02:46.910> matter

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
to the whole herd for that day you can

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:52.240 
to the whole herd for that day you can
go<00:02:50.120> on<00:02:50.300> later<00:02:50.510> with<00:02:50.810> those<00:02:51.020> numbers<00:02:51.290> once<00:02:52.069> you

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250 
go on later with those numbers once you

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:54.340 
go on later with those numbers once you
know<00:02:52.400> how<00:02:52.670> long<00:02:52.910> it's<00:02:53.150> going<00:02:53.239> to<00:02:53.330> take<00:02:53.540> each<00:02:54.080> of

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:54.350 
know how long it's going to take each of

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:56.380 
know how long it's going to take each of
your<00:02:54.380> paddocks<00:02:54.890> to<00:02:55.100> grow<00:02:55.310> back<00:02:55.519> up<00:02:55.820> to<00:02:56.180> the

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 
your paddocks to grow back up to the

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:58.300 
your paddocks to grow back up to the
full<00:02:56.630> pre<00:02:56.900> grazing<00:02:57.290> height<00:02:57.470> in<00:02:57.709> this<00:02:57.860> case<00:02:58.130> of

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310 
full pre grazing height in this case of

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:00.040 
full pre grazing height in this case of
about<00:02:58.519> eight<00:02:58.730> hundred<00:02:58.820> nine<00:02:59.330> inches<00:02:59.810> of

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:00.050 
about eight hundred nine inches of

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:02.410 
about eight hundred nine inches of
height<00:03:00.410> you<00:03:01.220> can<00:03:01.400> figure<00:03:01.580> out<00:03:01.700> how<00:03:02.000> many<00:03:02.060> total

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420 
height you can figure out how many total

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.360 
height you can figure out how many total
acres<00:03:02.959> that<00:03:03.410> you'll<00:03:03.530> need<00:03:03.709> to<00:03:03.769> graze<00:03:04.160> the

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370 
acres that you'll need to graze the

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:06.160 
acres that you'll need to graze the
whole<00:03:04.550> herd<00:03:04.790> now<00:03:05.300> that<00:03:05.480> you<00:03:05.840> know<00:03:05.989> how<00:03:06.140> much

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.170 
whole herd now that you know how much

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:09.880 
whole herd now that you know how much
it'll<00:03:07.010> take<00:03:07.190> to<00:03:07.340> feed<00:03:07.519> them<00:03:07.700> for<00:03:08.030> 24<00:03:08.450> hours<00:03:08.890> so

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:09.890 
it'll take to feed them for 24 hours so

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:12.160 
it'll take to feed them for 24 hours so
now<00:03:10.100> that<00:03:10.160> we<00:03:10.430> know<00:03:10.610> that<00:03:10.910> the<00:03:11.150> herd<00:03:11.360> needs<00:03:11.690> an

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 
now that we know that the herd needs an

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:14.979 
now that we know that the herd needs an
acre<00:03:12.709> and<00:03:12.920> a<00:03:12.950> quarter<00:03:13.370> to<00:03:13.760> feed<00:03:13.970> them<00:03:14.120> for<00:03:14.269> 24

00:03:14.979 --> 00:03:14.989 
acre and a quarter to feed them for 24

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:17.860 
acre and a quarter to feed them for 24
hours<00:03:15.560> let's<00:03:16.459> figure<00:03:16.730> out<00:03:16.880> how<00:03:17.300> many<00:03:17.540> total

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:17.870 
hours let's figure out how many total

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:20.140 
hours let's figure out how many total
acres<00:03:18.440> that<00:03:18.769> would<00:03:19.130> be<00:03:19.250> needed<00:03:19.610> to<00:03:19.730> feed<00:03:19.940> that

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150 
acres that would be needed to feed that

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:22.090 
acres that would be needed to feed that
herd<00:03:20.540> at<00:03:20.810> different<00:03:21.170> times<00:03:21.350> of<00:03:21.500> the<00:03:21.620> year

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:22.100 
herd at different times of the year

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:24.670 
herd at different times of the year
so<00:03:22.700> in<00:03:23.000> the<00:03:23.330> spring<00:03:23.690> when<00:03:24.319> the<00:03:24.350> grass<00:03:24.650> is

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:24.680 
so in the spring when the grass is

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:27.160 
so in the spring when the grass is
growing<00:03:25.100> very<00:03:25.430> rapidly<00:03:25.550> here<00:03:26.450> it's<00:03:26.930> going<00:03:27.110> to

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:27.170 
growing very rapidly here it's going to

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:29.440 
growing very rapidly here it's going to
take<00:03:27.380> about<00:03:27.620> eighteen<00:03:28.310> days<00:03:28.579> for<00:03:28.970> the<00:03:29.060> pasture

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:29.450 
take about eighteen days for the pasture

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:31.660 
take about eighteen days for the pasture
to<00:03:29.570> grow<00:03:29.780> back<00:03:30.079> up<00:03:30.350> to<00:03:30.890> the<00:03:31.010> correct<00:03:31.310> pre

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:31.670 
to grow back up to the correct pre

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:33.490 
to grow back up to the correct pre
grazing<00:03:32.030> height<00:03:32.239> in<00:03:32.480> this<00:03:32.630> case<00:03:32.930> the<00:03:33.170> farmers

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:33.500 
grazing height in this case the farmers

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:35.110 
grazing height in this case the farmers
goal<00:03:33.709> is<00:03:33.950> to<00:03:34.100> graze<00:03:34.310> it<00:03:34.489> when<00:03:34.820> it's<00:03:34.940> about

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 
goal is to graze it when it's about

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.930 
goal is to graze it when it's about
eight<00:03:35.360> to<00:03:35.540> nine<00:03:35.570> inches<00:03:36.019> tall<00:03:36.350> so<00:03:37.190> we<00:03:37.579> take<00:03:37.790> the

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:37.940 
eight to nine inches tall so we take the

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:41.350 
eight to nine inches tall so we take the
18<00:03:38.299> days<00:03:38.860> and<00:03:39.860> we<00:03:40.070> multiply<00:03:40.310> it<00:03:40.610> times<00:03:41.060> the

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:41.360 
18 days and we multiply it times the

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:44.770 
18 days and we multiply it times the
acre<00:03:41.540> and<00:03:41.780> a<00:03:41.810> quarter<00:03:42.200> and<00:03:43.209> we<00:03:44.209> know<00:03:44.390> that<00:03:44.570> that

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:44.780 
acre and a quarter and we know that that

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:46.990 
acre and a quarter and we know that that
farmer<00:03:45.230> needs<00:03:45.500> to<00:03:45.680> have<00:03:45.860> twenty-two<00:03:46.610> and<00:03:46.640> a

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:47.000 
farmer needs to have twenty-two and a

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.660 
farmer needs to have twenty-two and a
half<00:03:47.030> acres<00:03:47.570> in<00:03:48.170> the<00:03:48.350> spring<00:03:48.709> to<00:03:49.220> rotate

half acres in the spring to rotate

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:51.729 
half acres in the spring to rotate
through<00:03:50.000> that's<00:03:50.329> giving<00:03:50.780> the<00:03:50.959> cows<00:03:51.170> a<00:03:51.200> fresh

through that's giving the cows a fresh

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:54.009 
through that's giving the cows a fresh
paddock<00:03:52.130> every<00:03:52.489> day<00:03:52.730> it's<00:03:53.239> a<00:03:53.329> acre<00:03:53.750> and<00:03:53.959> a

to<00:04:21.919> go<00:04:22.070> back<00:04:22.250> it's<00:04:22.490> going<00:04:22.669> to<00:04:22.729> take<00:04:22.910> more<00:04:23.090> like

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:23.270 
to go back it's going to take more like

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:26.409 
to go back it's going to take more like
28<00:04:23.780> to<00:04:24.470> 30<00:04:24.979> days<00:04:25.220> in<00:04:25.610> the<00:04:25.640> middle<00:04:25.910> part<00:04:26.240> of<00:04:26.360> the

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:31.220 
be significantly longer than that so you

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:32.529 
be significantly longer than that so you

regrowth<00:04:42.050> period<00:04:42.530> we<00:04:43.190> take<00:04:43.400> the<00:04:43.630> 1.25<00:04:44.630> we

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:45.290 
regrowth period we take the 1.25 we

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:48.430 
regrowth period we take the 1.25 we
multiply<00:04:45.800> it<00:04:45.860> by<00:04:46.130> 30<00:04:46.490> and<00:04:46.930> the<00:04:47.930> farmer<00:04:48.260> now

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:48.440 
multiply it by 30 and the farmer now

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:52.000 
multiply it by 30 and the farmer now
needs<00:04:48.760> 37<00:04:49.760> and<00:04:50.000> a<00:04:50.060> half<00:04:50.090> acres<00:04:50.600> to<00:04:51.590> rotate

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:52.010 
needs 37 and a half acres to rotate

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:53.770 
needs 37 and a half acres to rotate
through<00:04:52.370> to<00:04:52.790> be<00:04:52.910> able<00:04:52.940> to<00:04:53.150> provide<00:04:53.420> the<00:04:53.600> same

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:53.780 
through to be able to provide the same

amount of dry matter intake to the cows
so<00:04:56.330> you<00:04:56.420> can<00:04:56.540> see<00:04:56.720> the<00:04:56.870> farm<00:04:57.110> has<00:04:57.320> gone<00:04:57.500> from

00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:57.680 
so you can see the farm has gone from

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:01.240 
so you can see the farm has gone from
needing<00:04:58.040> about<00:04:58.550> 22<00:04:59.120> and<00:04:59.150> a<00:04:59.330> half<00:04:59.510> acres<00:05:00.050> to<00:05:00.590> 37

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:01.250 
needing about 22 and a half acres to 37

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:05.800 
and a half acres during the summer and
there<00:05:04.280> may<00:05:04.430> be<00:05:04.460> times<00:05:04.820> in<00:05:05.150> the<00:05:05.270> summer<00:05:05.510> when

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:05.810 
there may be times in the summer when

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:07.510 
there may be times in the summer when
the<00:05:05.840> regrowth<00:05:06.200> periods<00:05:06.650> are<00:05:06.920> even<00:05:07.250> slower

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:07.520 
the regrowth periods are even slower

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:08.920 
the regrowth periods are even slower
than<00:05:07.760> that<00:05:07.790> and<00:05:08.150> you<00:05:08.330> would<00:05:08.450> need<00:05:08.600> even<00:05:08.810> more

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:08.930 
than that and you would need even more

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:11.170 
than that and you would need even more
acres<00:05:09.500> but<00:05:10.100> this<00:05:10.220> is<00:05:10.340> a<00:05:10.370> way<00:05:10.580> just<00:05:10.850> to<00:05:10.940> give<00:05:11.060> you
