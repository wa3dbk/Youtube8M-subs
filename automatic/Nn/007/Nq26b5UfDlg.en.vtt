loop so you can
yarn<00:02:13.430> keychain<00:02:14.430> and<00:02:14.840> the<00:02:15.840> next<00:02:16.560> thing<00:02:16.860> is<00:02:17.280> this

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
yarn keychain and the next thing is this

like<00:02:30.780> they<00:02:31.530> might<00:02:31.680> have<00:02:31.830> some<00:02:32.040> practical<00:02:32.460> and

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
like they might have some practical and

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.100 
like they might have some practical and
