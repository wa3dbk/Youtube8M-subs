00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:38.170 
down but I was going around on the slab
which<00:05:36.860> mean<00:05:37.070> it's<00:05:37.250> like<00:05:37.430> he<00:05:37.760> doesn't<00:05:37.880> have

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:38.180 
which mean it's like he doesn't have

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:41.540 
which mean it's like he doesn't have
very<00:05:38.210> big<00:05:38.570> folds

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:41.550
