things in the part in these plates in
you<00:04:46.150> hole<00:04:46.420> are<00:04:47.020> doing<00:04:50.610> back<00:04:51.610> it<00:04:51.880> and<00:04:52.120> she

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:52.300 
you hole are doing back it and she

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:53.820 
you hole are doing back it and she
cuffed<00:04:52.570> it<00:04:52.780> look<00:04:52.960> at<00:04:53.080> the<00:04:53.170> jack-o'-lantern

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:53.830 
cuffed it look at the jack-o'-lantern

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:56.760 
cuffed it look at the jack-o'-lantern
and<00:04:53.980> it<00:04:54.190> does<00:04:54.720> you<00:04:55.720> look<00:04:55.900> at<00:04:56.050> these<00:04:56.170> objects

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:56.770 
and it does you look at these objects

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:58.380 
and it does you look at these objects
and<00:04:56.860> in<00:04:56.980> a<00:04:57.100> column<00:04:57.370> sometimes<00:04:57.850> I<00:04:57.970> think<00:04:58.030> of<00:04:58.240> it

00:04:58.380 --> 00:04:58.390 
and in a column sometimes I think of it

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:00.870 
and in a column sometimes I think of it
being<00:04:58.540> almost<00:04:58.810> infinite<00:04:59.380> or<00:04:59.560> quality<00:05:00.010> but<00:05:00.760> I

qualities that are very much about the
20th<00:05:24.340> century<00:05:24.670> that<00:05:24.910> are<00:05:25.000> very<00:05:25.180> much<00:05:25.390> modern

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:25.690 
20th century that are very much modern

20th century that are very much modern
sort<00:05:26.470> of<00:05:26.760> emphasizing<00:05:27.760> harmony<00:05:28.330> is<00:05:28.390> the<00:05:28.570> shape

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:28.840 
sort of emphasizing harmony is the shape

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:30.930 
sort of emphasizing harmony is the shape
that<00:05:28.870> have<00:05:29.170> colored<00:05:29.620> but<00:05:30.220> putting<00:05:30.490> it<00:05:30.700> in<00:05:30.820> a

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:30.940 
that have colored but putting it in a

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:33.630 
that have colored but putting it in a
java<00:05:31.180> theme<00:05:31.510> which<00:05:31.810> again<00:05:32.070> I<00:05:33.070> think<00:05:33.160> is<00:05:33.490> the

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:33.640 
java theme which again I think is the

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:35.700 
java theme which again I think is the
view<00:05:33.850> there<00:05:34.060> especially<00:05:34.990> in<00:05:35.230> it<00:05:35.350> white<00:05:35.530> the

view there especially in it white the
particular<00:05:36.220> painting<00:05:36.460> file

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:37.950 
particular painting file

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:40.790 
particular painting file
well<00:05:38.100> I<00:05:38.130> mentioned<00:05:38.700> that<00:05:38.930> the<00:05:39.930> sort<00:05:40.140> of<00:05:40.230> it's

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:40.800 
well I mentioned that the sort of it's

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:42.620 
well I mentioned that the sort of it's
company<00:05:41.250> seen<00:05:41.430> a<00:05:41.460> picture<00:05:41.700> like<00:05:41.880> this<00:05:41.970> and<00:05:42.300> the

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:44.730 
truth of the figure really does seem to

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:46.190 
truth of the figure really does seem to
have<00:05:44.850> something<00:05:45.120> to<00:05:45.330> do<00:05:45.540> with<00:05:45.690> his<00:05:45.840> personal

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:46.200

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:21.200 
I think it oftentimes the defective
pictures<00:06:19.590> by<00:06:19.770> Bernard<00:06:20.130> because<00:06:20.790> their<00:06:21.000> color

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:21.210 
pictures by Bernard because their color

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:23.330 
pictures by Bernard because their color
got<00:06:21.690> until<00:06:22.020> this<00:06:22.230> point<00:06:22.440> you<00:06:22.950> pick<00:06:23.070> up<00:06:23.220> the

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:23.340 
got until this point you pick up the

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:25.100 
got until this point you pick up the
colors<00:06:23.610> are<00:06:23.760> so<00:06:23.910> bright<00:06:24.090> and<00:06:24.420> vibrant<00:06:24.540> and

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:25.110 
colors are so bright and vibrant and

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:26.840 
colors are so bright and vibrant and
because<00:06:25.440> the<00:06:25.530> brushstroke<00:06:26.040> has<00:06:26.490> that<00:06:26.640> kind<00:06:26.820> of

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:26.850 
because the brushstroke has that kind of

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:28.490 
because the brushstroke has that kind of
impressionist<00:06:27.330> feel<00:06:27.660> that<00:06:28.170> there's<00:06:28.350> a<00:06:28.470> sense

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:28.500 
impressionist feel that there's a sense

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:30.110 
impressionist feel that there's a sense
of<00:06:28.800> own<00:06:28.950> art<00:06:29.130> as<00:06:29.250> being<00:06:29.280> the<00:06:29.670> features

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:30.120 
of own art as being the features

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:32.510 
of own art as being the features
happiness<00:06:30.780> the<00:06:31.140> painters<00:06:31.590> want<00:06:31.950> to<00:06:32.070> be<00:06:32.220> but

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:32.520 
happiness the painters want to be but

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:33.830 
happiness the painters want to be but
there's<00:06:32.700> nothing<00:06:33.090> more<00:06:33.270> than<00:06:33.450> the<00:06:33.570> pleasure

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:33.840 
there's nothing more than the pleasure

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:36.620 
there's nothing more than the pleasure
of<00:06:33.990> color<00:06:34.470> or<00:06:34.830> paint<00:06:35.130> on<00:06:35.370> the<00:06:35.490> surface<00:06:35.940> and<00:06:36.210> yet

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:36.630 
of color or paint on the surface and yet

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:38.390 
of color or paint on the surface and yet
I<00:06:36.870> like<00:06:37.230> to<00:06:37.350> point<00:06:37.500> out<00:06:37.680> the<00:06:37.800> fact<00:06:37.950> that<00:06:38.160> there

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:38.400 
I like to point out the fact that there

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:39.800 
I like to point out the fact that there
certainly<00:06:38.610> are<00:06:39.030> underpinning<00:06:39.660> a<00:06:39.690> few

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:39.810 
certainly are underpinning a few

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:41.300 
certainly are underpinning a few
pictures<00:06:40.140> I<00:06:40.530> think<00:06:40.590> there<00:06:40.860> is<00:06:40.980> more<00:06:41.160> than

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:41.310 
pictures I think there is more than

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:41.720 
pictures I think there is more than
meets<00:06:41.460> the<00:06:41.550> eye

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:41.730 
meets the eye

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:43.520 
meets the eye
I<00:06:42.000> think<00:06:42.600> there's<00:06:42.780> plenty<00:06:42.990> here<00:06:43.290> could<00:06:43.500> be

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:43.530 
I think there's plenty here could be

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:45.020 
I think there's plenty here could be
admired<00:06:43.830> for<00:06:43.950> the<00:06:44.130> formal<00:06:44.430> qualities<00:06:44.550> and

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:45.030 
admired for the formal qualities and

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:46.610 
admired for the formal qualities and
what<00:06:45.120> he's<00:06:45.270> working<00:06:45.480> out<00:06:45.780> but<00:06:46.200> I<00:06:46.260> think<00:06:46.350> it's

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:46.620 
what he's working out but I think it's

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:48.890 
what he's working out but I think it's
dangerous<00:06:46.800> to<00:06:47.130> sort<00:06:47.460> of<00:06:47.520> separate<00:06:48.360> quote<00:06:48.720> our

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:48.900 
dangerous to sort of separate quote our

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:50.810 
dangerous to sort of separate quote our
demand<00:06:49.320> a<00:06:49.500> boner<00:06:49.740> as<00:06:49.800> a<00:06:49.920> person<00:06:50.340> from<00:06:50.610> the

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:50.820 
demand a boner as a person from the

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:52.400 
demand a boner as a person from the
subject<00:06:51.240> matter<00:06:51.420> and<00:06:51.600> how<00:06:51.840> he<00:06:51.900> chooses<00:06:52.260> to

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:52.410 
subject matter and how he chooses to
