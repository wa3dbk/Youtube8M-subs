00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:09.500
 migrants call it the jungle this 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:12.660
 camp lost in open country 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:15.480
 except that there is a highway and 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.730
 trucks that go to calais at 70 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:21.650
 kilometers away for migrants who 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.650
 sleep here the place is strategic 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:26.789
 we ride in the trucks we must not 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.519
 that the driver sees us because he knows 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.560
 not that there are people in his truck 

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:34.530
 after that it's a matter of luck needed 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.010
 slip through the cracks if one 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:40.440
 get there 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:42.210
 so that's it's england this 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.600
 jungle is not far from a small 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.329
 city 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.620
 steenvoorde 4000 inhabitants during the 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.969
 day a local association 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:52.140
 take care of migrants 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:54.329
 they are not many here so they are 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.770
 all groomed if you want the number 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:01:00.000
 can we bring attention 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:01.760
 particular to each and every 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.870
 they are now sixty 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:06.659
 mainly Eritreans and 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.970
 Sudanese men of women for whom 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:12.600
 steenvoorde is a good transit place 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.950
 more comfortable than calais at Calais 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.869
 conditions are worse 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:19.950
 there are police and dogs 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:22.259
 sniffers everywhere but they do not we 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.159
 do not like they do everything for us 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.210
 prevent going 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:29.369
 that's why I'm here for this theme 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:31.650
 in one year their number has more than doubled 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.299
 the cohabitation is going pretty well 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.189
 with the locals I meet them in 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.509
 street say hello to me he told me I 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:38.250
 will answer me they are very kind 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:41.570
 very polite for me there's no problem 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:43.409
 but the municipality says it is deprived 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:44.970
 how do you want a commune 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.290
 could have hosted his territory at a 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.040
 hundred miles invaded good 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.930
 conditions also knowing that 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:53.860
 there are other social problems if the 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:56.380
 municipality has still not that the 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:59.140
 current unemployment happened days 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:00.340
 the mayor calls the state for help she 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:03.220
 fears that the eyes are focused 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:06.060
 only on calais she fears to be 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:06.060
 set aside
