for me live versatility is the is the

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.750 
for me live versatility is the is the
primary<00:01:06.390> mode<00:01:07.200> motivator<00:01:07.980> for<00:01:08.070> what<00:01:08.460> guitar

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
primary mode motivator for what guitar

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:31.580 
primary mode motivator for what guitar
I'm<00:01:08.880> gonna<00:01:09.060> choose

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.779 

first<00:01:32.590> impression<00:01:32.920> of<00:01:32.950> the<00:01:33.070> guitar<00:01:33.280> had<00:01:33.549> a<00:01:33.579> lot

00:01:33.779 --> 00:01:33.789 
first impression of the guitar had a lot

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:37.260 
first impression of the guitar had a lot
of<00:01:33.880> sustain<00:01:34.060> I<00:01:35.219> got<00:01:36.219> a<00:01:36.250> heavier<00:01:36.729> sound<00:01:36.939> that<00:01:37.210> I

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:37.270 
of sustain I got a heavier sound that I

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:39.330 
of sustain I got a heavier sound that I
initially<00:01:37.479> thought<00:01:37.689> I<00:01:37.869> could<00:01:38.229> and<00:01:38.439> I<00:01:38.799> was

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:39.340 
initially thought I could and I was

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:47.520 
initially thought I could and I was
pretty<00:01:39.700> impressed<00:01:39.939> with<00:01:40.090> that

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:47.530 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:50.020 

the<00:01:48.530> acoustic<00:01:48.980> sounds<00:01:49.310> where<00:01:49.490> I<00:01:49.520> thought<00:01:49.820> were

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.030 
the acoustic sounds where I thought were

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:55.300 
the acoustic sounds where I thought were
pretty<00:01:50.690> much<00:01:50.810> spot-on

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:57.580 

to<00:01:55.880> get<00:01:56.060> raped<00:01:56.299> or<00:01:56.540> not<00:01:56.810> I<00:01:56.840> think<00:01:57.229> no<00:01:57.409> matter

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:57.590 
to get raped or not I think no matter

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:18.119 
to get raped or not I think no matter
where<00:01:57.950> you<00:01:58.100> are

00:02:18.119 --> 00:02:18.129 

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:19.990 

that's<00:02:19.129> the<00:02:19.250> kind<00:02:19.400> of<00:02:19.459> guitar<00:02:19.550> I've<00:02:19.849> been

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
that's the kind of guitar I've been

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.890 
that's the kind of guitar I've been
looking<00:02:20.239> for<00:02:20.450> you<00:02:20.599> know

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.210 

this<00:02:24.900> sustains<00:02:25.320> something<00:02:25.740> that<00:02:25.830> got<00:02:25.980> me<00:02:26.130> the

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
this sustains something that got me the

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:27.830 
this sustains something that got me the
most<00:02:26.340> out<00:02:26.580> of<00:02:26.610> really<00:02:27.150> I<00:02:27.210> was<00:02:27.330> trying<00:02:27.540> to<00:02:27.630> hold

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
most out of really I was trying to hold

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:38.740 
most out of really I was trying to hold
notes<00:02:28.080> outs<00:02:29.030> so<00:02:30.030> long<00:02:30.240> they<00:02:30.390> went

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:41.810 

it<00:02:39.750> sounds<00:02:40.320> great<00:02:40.560> I<00:02:40.860> like<00:02:41.220> the<00:02:41.370> fact<00:02:41.550> that<00:02:41.640> it

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.820 
it sounds great I like the fact that it

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:44.000 
it sounds great I like the fact that it
can<00:02:41.910> switch<00:02:42.180> between<00:02:42.300> amps<00:02:42.870> from<00:02:43.530> the<00:02:43.710> guitar

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
can switch between amps from the guitar

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:49.430 
can switch between amps from the guitar
itself<00:02:44.400> I<00:02:46.460> end<00:02:47.460> up<00:02:47.640> playing<00:02:48.110> acoustic<00:02:49.110> on

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
itself I end up playing acoustic on

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:50.930 
itself I end up playing acoustic on
those<00:02:49.800> to<00:02:49.980> the<00:02:50.070> song<00:02:50.250> and<00:02:50.430> then<00:02:50.520> I<00:02:50.610> just<00:02:50.790> need<00:02:50.910> a

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
those to the song and then I just need a

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.930 
those to the song and then I just need a
little<00:02:51.270> bit<00:02:51.480> more<00:02:52.040> love<00:02:53.040> on<00:02:53.340> the<00:02:53.490> end<00:02:53.640> of<00:02:53.760> it<00:02:53.850> if

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
little bit more love on the end of it if

00:02:53.940 --> 00:03:03.800 
little bit more love on the end of it if
I'm<00:02:54.060> doing<00:02:54.240> a<00:02:54.300> solo<00:02:54.450> or<00:02:54.750> something<00:02:54.810> like<00:02:55.140> that

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:14.120 

I<00:03:11.780> think<00:03:12.780> I<00:03:12.870> would<00:03:13.319> love<00:03:13.560> to<00:03:13.680> just<00:03:13.800> be<00:03:13.950> able<00:03:14.010> to

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130 
I think I would love to just be able to

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:15.710 
I think I would love to just be able to
take<00:03:14.310> out<00:03:14.459> one<00:03:14.670> guitar<00:03:14.819> that<00:03:15.270> would<00:03:15.360> work<00:03:15.480> and

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
take out one guitar that would work and

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.180 
take out one guitar that would work and
that<00:03:16.200> would<00:03:16.290> cover<00:03:16.440> all<00:03:16.560> bases<00:03:16.770> that

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
that would cover all bases that

00:03:17.190 --> 00:04:21.819 
that would cover all bases that
certainly<00:03:17.550> would<00:03:17.670> have<00:03:17.790> would<00:03:18.150> fit<00:03:18.300> the<00:03:18.390> role

00:04:21.819 --> 00:04:21.829 

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:23.889
