00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:08.300
 Good morning, few know what 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:11.160
 hibiscus, but everyone knows the Chinese rose 

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:15.750
 how is it correct hibiscus or chinese 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:17.940
 rose chinese rose sudanese rose well 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.310
 it is what is right and 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.660
 the botanical name of this plant is all 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.850
 we saw him and 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.730
 this is a plant that, together with probably 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:29.220
 ficus is considered a plant there our 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.830
 grandmothers great-grandmothers a couple of centuries ago 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.600
 quite definitely used it already 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.780
 indoor floriculture 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.370
 why is it so common if 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.040
 one of you was 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.530
 Well, at least we probably in the area Sochi 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.129
 and even better in Turkey saw that 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.739
 the streets 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:49.739
 grow and it is these plants and 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.780
 they are called hibiscus here please 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.840
 look what a bright representative 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:57.480
 this plant this plant brought 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:00.300
 from Holland they are usually small 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.230
 with close internodes enough 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.570
 long bloom 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.030
 but then it got rooted very 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.790
 reluctant amount of colors 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.520
 the size of a flower is its shape 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.740
 it is so great that 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.560
 list them and show in one plot 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.600
 in general it is simply impossible I think that 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:22.020
 and there is no such person who would be in his 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:24.450
 life would see all the options of hibiscus 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:27.450
 plant very decorative look 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:30.180
 flower very interesting beautiful corolla 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.759
 differently colored it happens moreover 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.650
 and terry look how interesting 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.390
 arranged by the generative organs of this 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:39.290
 flower pistil with stamens 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:41.340
 creeps out of the corolla and thereby 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:43.619
 insect which attracts 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.960
 coloring petals arriving at the flower 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:48.600
 inevitably affects him all this 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.939
 made to happen better 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.649
 pollination and then the seeds were set 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:55.380
 except that 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:58.320
 hibiscus of course very different in 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:01.560
 color in the form of a flower still they 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:04.049
 differ in color and shape of leaves 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.310
 Well, for example, about me is this 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:08.670
 wonderful specimen 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:10.179
 variegated form see tricolor here 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.750
 on one sheet we see 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:16.629
 and light green dark green and white 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:18.700
 After all, what a beautiful well-dressed but how 

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:21.780
 The rule of flowers such forms such 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:25.560
 relatively simple options are very 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:28.540
 from these faces of the coils make tea karkade 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:31.389
 if sands of certain varieties do 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:33.400
 tea and that's probably every one of you 

00:02:31.389 --> 00:02:35.280
 once in a lifetime sang some fruit tea 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:38.200
 which is now very much on sale 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:40.659
 coloring it torment the dark unless 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.379
 just given to the hibiscus petals 

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:44.709
 hibiscus 

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:47.620
 and how demanding home care 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:50.019
 hibiscus hibiscus enough 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:52.419
 unpretentious in any room there 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:55.480
 enough light to feel 

00:02:52.419 --> 00:02:57.129
 ok but bloom only happens 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:59.590
 then when there is a lot of light 

00:02:57.129 --> 00:03:01.750
 an excess of light lead the formation 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:04.989
 flower buds and then your plant 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:08.200
 will successfully bloom from pests need 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:11.560
 call first hatch and if summer 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:13.900
 generally around in nature a lot of aphids 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:16.599
 then most likely it is through the window 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:18.489
 will fall on your hibiscus as usual we 

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:21.459
 treat a plant like that 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:24.310
 insecticide don't forget that processing 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:26.340
 must be 2 three times this way 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:29.470
 you can handle the invasion 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:30.959
 hibiscus especially blooming loves 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:33.790
 when he is fed 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:36.790
 organic fertilizer or mineral 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:38.919
 somewhere every 3 weeks in the summer 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:41.650
 I will not prevent the birth of a 

00:03:38.919 --> 00:03:45.069
 on the contrary will contribute to the fact that 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:47.500
 your hibiscus is a powerful beautiful in 

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:48.509
 it will be long lasting 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:52.030
 bloom 

00:03:48.509 --> 00:03:55.500
 goodbye all the best to you and 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:55.500
 have a nice day
