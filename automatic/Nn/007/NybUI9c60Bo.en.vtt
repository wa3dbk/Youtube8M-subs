the<00:04:27.210> form<00:04:27.480> of<00:04:27.660> a<00:04:27.870> loading<00:04:28.230> graph<00:04:28.440> or<00:04:28.650> table<00:04:29.450> the

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:30.450 
the form of a loading graph or table the

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:33.590 
the form of a loading graph or table the
moment<00:04:31.020> is<00:04:31.169> the<00:04:31.620> product<00:04:32.100> of<00:04:32.190> the<00:04:32.340> arm<00:04:32.610> times

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:33.600 
moment is the product of the arm times

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:36.440 
moment is the product of the arm times
the<00:04:33.900> weight<00:04:34.520> moments<00:04:35.520> are<00:04:35.640> always<00:04:36.000> expressed

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:36.450 
the weight moments are always expressed

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:40.310 
the weight moments are always expressed
in<00:04:37.290> pound<00:04:37.830> inches<00:04:38.580> a<00:04:38.870> good<00:04:39.870> way<00:04:40.020> to<00:04:40.080> remember

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:40.320 
in pound inches a good way to remember

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:44.420 
in pound inches a good way to remember
the<00:04:40.710> formula<00:04:40.919> is<00:04:41.400> WAM<00:04:42.060> wait<00:04:42.870> times<00:04:43.350> arm<00:04:43.740> equals

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:44.430 
the formula is WAM wait times arm equals

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:47.659 
the formula is WAM wait times arm equals
moment<00:04:45.020> the<00:04:46.020> arm<00:04:46.229> has<00:04:46.560> a<00:04:46.590> significant<00:04:47.340> effect

00:04:47.659 --> 00:04:47.669 
moment the arm has a significant effect

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:56.380 
moment the arm has a significant effect
on<00:04:47.850> weight

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:56.390
