00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.240 
going to fire it up one more time in
just<00:02:04.940> a<00:02:05.060> second<00:02:05.619> check<00:02:06.619> and<00:02:06.799> see<00:02:06.890> what<00:02:07.009> kind<00:02:07.159> of

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 
just a second check and see what kind of

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:09.690 
just a second check and see what kind of
temperature<00:02:07.610> we're<00:02:07.789> getting

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700 
temperature we're getting

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.300 
temperature we're getting
let's<00:02:10.330> get<00:02:10.450> a<00:02:10.509> little<00:02:10.660> more<00:02:10.780> in<00:02:11.200> it<00:02:11.319> nothing

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
let's get a little more in it nothing

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:16.760 
let's get a little more in it nothing
extreme<00:02:13.020> right<00:02:14.020> now<00:02:14.170> it's<00:02:14.380> that<00:02:14.730> hundred<00:02:15.730> and

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
extreme right now it's that hundred and

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:21.630 
extreme right now it's that hundred and
it's<00:02:17.770> about<00:02:17.890> 105<00:02:18.400> degrees<00:02:20.190> 105<00:02:21.190> degrees<00:02:21.489> of

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
it's about 105 degrees 105 degrees of

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:22.920 
it's about 105 degrees 105 degrees of
temperature<00:02:21.790> which<00:02:22.180> is<00:02:22.360> you<00:02:22.540> know<00:02:22.630> it's<00:02:22.750> still

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
temperature which is you know it's still

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:29.100 
temperature which is you know it's still
relatively<00:02:23.349> cool<00:02:23.650> both<00:02:24.250> sides<00:02:25.170> and<00:02:27.630> okay<00:02:28.630> I'm

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
relatively cool both sides and okay I'm

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:30.600 
relatively cool both sides and okay I'm
gonna<00:02:29.290> I'm<00:02:29.530> going<00:02:29.650> to<00:02:29.709> spin<00:02:30.040> the<00:02:30.130> motor<00:02:30.280> you'll

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
gonna I'm going to spin the motor you'll

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:33.510 
gonna I'm going to spin the motor you'll
hear<00:02:30.790> it<00:02:30.880> spin<00:02:31.209> it's<00:02:31.569> been<00:02:31.840> with<00:02:32.800> the<00:02:32.890> 24<00:02:33.310> volt

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:33.520 
hear it spin it's been with the 24 volt

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:38.190 
hear it spin it's been with the 24 volt
system<00:02:33.880> it<00:02:34.000> really<00:02:34.180> spins<00:02:37.019> though<00:02:38.019> the

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
system it really spins though the

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:44.070 
system it really spins though the
ignition<00:02:38.590> on<00:02:40.140> come<00:02:41.140> on<00:02:41.260> for<00:02:41.440> just<00:02:41.620> second<00:02:43.080> turn

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.080 
ignition on come on for just second turn

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:45.860 
ignition on come on for just second turn
the<00:02:44.260> fuel<00:02:44.440> on

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
okay and then this red button right here

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.440 
okay and then this red button right here
it's<00:02:49.290> the<00:02:49.440> primer<00:02:49.680> system<00:02:50.160> you'll<00:02:51.120> hear<00:02:51.330> it

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
it's the primer system you'll hear it

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.759 
it's the primer system you'll hear it
hopefully<00:02:52.080> it'll<00:02:53.300> shoot<00:02:54.300> a<00:02:54.390> little<00:02:54.650> fuel<00:02:55.650> in

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:55.769 
hopefully it'll shoot a little fuel in

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:59.390 
hopefully it'll shoot a little fuel in
the<00:02:55.950> engine<00:02:57.200> okay<00:02:58.200> and<00:02:58.530> then<00:02:58.980> here's<00:02:59.220> the

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400

able<00:03:43.240> to<00:03:43.360> see<00:03:43.480> how<00:03:43.720> easy<00:03:43.960> it<00:03:44.080> starts<00:03:44.500> and<00:03:45.060> how

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:46.060 
able to see how easy it starts and how

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:50.070 
able to see how easy it starts and how
it<00:03:46.210> runs<00:03:46.390> it<00:03:46.630> runs<00:03:46.810> perfectly<00:03:48.780> kind<00:03:49.780> of<00:03:49.870> doing

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:50.080 
it runs it runs perfectly kind of doing

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:51.600 
it runs it runs perfectly kind of doing
this<00:03:50.170> by<00:03:50.350> myself<00:03:50.770> right<00:03:50.950> now<00:03:51.010> so<00:03:51.310> it's<00:03:51.430> kind<00:03:51.580> of

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:51.610 
this by myself right now so it's kind of

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:54.840 
this by myself right now so it's kind of
difficult<00:03:51.820> to<00:03:52.380> operate<00:03:53.380> the<00:03:53.470> Cameron<00:03:53.920> and<00:03:54.160> I

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:54.850 
difficult to operate the Cameron and I

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:57.630 
difficult to operate the Cameron and I
like<00:03:55.840> to<00:03:55.960> let<00:03:56.110> the<00:03:56.230> motor<00:03:56.740> warm<00:03:57.040> up<00:03:57.220> completely

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:57.640 
like to let the motor warm up completely

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:59.700 
like to let the motor warm up completely
before<00:03:58.060> I<00:03:58.090> give<00:03:58.450> it<00:03:58.480> any<00:03:58.720> RPM<00:03:59.230> and<00:03:59.440> so<00:03:59.560> it's

00:03:59.700 --> 00:03:59.710 
before I give it any RPM and so it's

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:04.620 
before I give it any RPM and so it's
it's<00:04:00.580> getting<00:04:01.150> somewhat<00:04:01.540> warm<00:04:01.980> but<00:04:02.980> ok<00:04:03.630> let's

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:04.630 
it's getting somewhat warm but ok let's

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:06.030 
it's getting somewhat warm but ok let's
see<00:04:04.810> it's<00:04:04.960> probably<00:04:05.350> about<00:04:05.440> 110<00:04:06.010> degrees
