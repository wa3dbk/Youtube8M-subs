00:00:06.487 --> 00:00:11.697
 Think of a luxury sedan. With rear propulsion, and a powerful turbo engine. 

00:00:12.277 --> 00:00:17.167
 You've probably thought about BMW 3. Today there's a slightly different option. 

00:00:17.747 --> 00:00:20.647
 Get to know the new Cadillac ATS. 

00:00:20.647 --> 00:00:24.407
 One of the more interesting competitors, BMW 3 series. 

00:00:24.795 --> 00:00:31.515
 So the design is like any Cadillac, very angular, very sharp, and very impressive. 

00:00:38.115 --> 00:00:44.065
 Well, if you have not noticed, the low roof line, a little disturbing to the entrance into the vehicle, 

00:00:44.065 --> 00:00:48.585
 And it is not certain that it will be convenient for everyone. The seat itself is wonderful, it envelops the driver, 

00:00:48.585 --> 00:00:52.865
 There are plenty of tuning options, as well as heating for cold winter days, 

00:00:52.865 --> 00:00:58.085
 If you can find many of them in Israel. Beyond that, the steering wheel also adjusts in depth, 

00:00:59.475 --> 00:01:03.165
 And that makes the entire subject of the meeting in the car, not a bad experience at all, 

00:01:03.165 --> 00:01:05.125
 As long as you do not like sitting very high. 

00:01:06.035 --> 00:01:13.035
 As befits a luxury vehicle, the quality of the materials is wonderful. Almost everywhere you will find pleasant skin to touch, 

00:01:13.035 --> 00:01:19.655
 Also plastics at a very high level. The quality of the assembly, on the other hand, is not so good. 

00:01:19.655 --> 00:01:24.565
 This car was ten thousand miles away, and we found some parts that were already loosening. 

00:01:24.565 --> 00:01:26.975
 Well, we're talking about an American vehicle, not a German. 

00:01:26.975 --> 00:01:32.835
 And here there is an advantage, because the car is blown with accessories. Starting with an audio system with steering control, 

00:01:32.835 --> 00:01:38.355
 Split climate control, Bluetooth, what else? There are magnesium hoops, 

00:01:38.355 --> 00:01:43.385
 Electric folding mirrors, have cruise control and electric seats, have I said? 

00:01:43.385 --> 00:01:48.465
 So far, the basic version. Yes, there is also a fully equipped version, and here there is even more: 

00:01:48.465 --> 00:01:54.655
 There's a sunroof, there's an indication of the speed of the ride on the windshield, it's something really cool. 

00:01:54.655 --> 00:02:00.185
 There is one more thing, very very important, differential differential limited skating. 

00:02:00.185 --> 00:02:02.375
 What it means? You'll understand later. 

00:02:02.375 --> 00:02:07.545
 So, as you understood, there is a lot of equipment here, but in order to operate everything, you need something 

00:02:07.545 --> 00:02:12.185
 Let him do the mess. At Cadillac, we designed a system called CUE. 

00:02:12.185 --> 00:02:16.985
 And this system controls most parameters of the car, from a huge touch screen in the center of the car. 

00:02:16.985 --> 00:02:23.495
 But, just like the first time Audi and BMW started with these systems, here too, 

00:02:23.495 --> 00:02:29.045
 Human engineering is not so good, and you will not always get to the right menu, or the right button. 

00:02:37.525 --> 00:02:43.285
 If it was hard to get in front, it would be even more complicated. It's because of the roof, which falls early. 

00:02:43.285 --> 00:02:47.595
 The leg spacing is reasonable, but the back spacing will be borderline for tall people. 

00:02:47.595 --> 00:02:53.445
 About a third passenger? There's nothing to talk about, this huge conveyor belt and these merger openings, 

00:02:53.445 --> 00:02:55.795
 Just do not let anyone sit here. 

00:02:55.795 --> 00:03:02.445
 The trunk is high, but very narrow. And it is inconvenient to load and unload equipment. 

00:03:03.385 --> 00:03:07.145
 So, the city is not the natural habitat of the ATS. 

00:03:07.145 --> 00:03:09.325
 The tires are very low cut 

00:03:09.325 --> 00:03:13.765
 This makes the trip a bit too rigid, about ignorance and disruptions within the city. 

00:03:13.765 --> 00:03:19.235
 And the field of view to the sides, because of the large beams and the large mirrors, is not so good. 

00:03:19.235 --> 00:03:24.185
 But there's a reverse camera here, and the rear-view camera helps with tight parking maneuvers. 

00:03:24.185 --> 00:03:28.345
 So we said before, that the ATS is not the most comfortable within the city. 

00:03:28.345 --> 00:03:31.745
 Outside the city, things get a bit better, especially when the speed rises. 

00:03:31.745 --> 00:03:37.365
 True, the hard calibration takes bumps off the road, but the car is very restrained 

00:03:37.365 --> 00:03:41.755
 And very pleasant for a long trip. Another reason for this, it's pretty good noise insulation, 

00:03:41.755 --> 00:03:44.355
 Both wind noise and road noise. 

00:03:45.305 --> 00:03:48.805
 Do you remember? We talked at first, about a powerful turbo engine. 

00:03:48.805 --> 00:03:52.965
 So that's what it is. But you'll be surprised to discover, it's not a V8 or a V6, 

00:03:52.965 --> 00:03:59.545
 This is a four-cylinder engine that delivers 272 hp and that's pretty much enough. 

00:04:00.645 --> 00:04:02.295
 Let's start with the minus of this engine: 

00:04:02.295 --> 00:04:07.355
 He did not sound very good, we were expecting such a strong engine to be heard accordingly, 

00:04:07.355 --> 00:04:11.825
 But it is small, because it is a very powerful engine, which carries the wonderful vehicle, 

00:04:12.185 --> 00:04:18.755
 It is very flexible in terms of its torque, and it is possible to reach very respectable speeds. 

00:04:18.755 --> 00:04:25.095
 The gearbox is completely smooth, no complaints. And there is a very nice possibility of changing gears from the steering wheel. 

00:04:25.505 --> 00:04:31.535
 Look, the ATS is supposed to compete with the BMW 3 Series and as such, not only will it be a good car, 

00:04:31.535 --> 00:04:33.735
 She should have some extra. 

00:04:33.735 --> 00:04:38.465
 And in Cadillac, they chose to go to BMW's home field, which is the road behavior. 

00:04:38.465 --> 00:04:43.245
 If you remember, in the accessory section, we talked about limited skating differential. 

00:04:44.285 --> 00:04:46.665
 What it means? That means she knows how to do it. 

00:04:48.825 --> 00:04:50.715
 And that too. 

00:04:51.155 --> 00:04:55.225
 And that's really cool, by the way. It's a driving machine, just fun. 

00:04:55.225 --> 00:04:59.225
 The chassis is very very sharp, the wheel exactly the right size, 

00:04:59.225 --> 00:05:02.905
 Is very fast, and only lacks some communication from it. 

00:05:02.905 --> 00:05:06.225
 And the tendency to over-pronounce, that's what we love. 

00:05:06.225 --> 00:05:12.645
 Forget what you knew about American cars. The Cadillac ATS, is a luxury sedan 

00:05:12.645 --> 00:05:16.315
 Very successful. With Extra Great Road Behavior, 

00:05:16.315 --> 00:05:18.495
 Have I already said Luna Park?
