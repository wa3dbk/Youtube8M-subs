why this is just sort of distracting

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:08.599 
why this is just sort of distracting

from the real story the meat of the

from the real story the meat of the

00:03:10.189 --> 00:03:10.199 
story the part that we should be

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:14.059 
story the part that we should be
focusing<00:03:10.769> on<00:03:10.919> the<00:03:11.340> the<00:03:11.849> real<00:03:13.040> meat<00:03:14.040> and

00:03:14.059 --> 00:03:14.069 
focusing on the the real meat and

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:18.409 
focusing on the the real meat and
potatoes<00:03:14.310> as<00:03:15.120> you<00:03:15.510> can<00:03:15.689> say<00:03:16.189> but<00:03:17.189> as<00:03:17.400> I<00:03:17.609> kind<00:03:18.209> of

00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:18.419 
potatoes as you can say but as I kind of

00:03:18.419 --> 00:03:20.869 
potatoes as you can say but as I kind of
let<00:03:18.689> this<00:03:18.930> stuff<00:03:19.259> roll<00:03:19.709> over<00:03:20.129> in<00:03:20.280> my<00:03:20.430> head<00:03:20.609> over

let this stuff roll over in my head over

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:23.089 
let this stuff roll over in my head over
the<00:03:21.000> past<00:03:21.269> few<00:03:21.540> nights<00:03:21.599> I<00:03:22.019> started<00:03:22.470> to<00:03:22.650> really

00:03:23.089 --> 00:03:23.099 
the past few nights I started to really

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:26.409 
the past few nights I started to really
think<00:03:23.220> that<00:03:23.729> it<00:03:24.090> was<00:03:24.659> this<00:03:25.310> family

00:03:26.409 --> 00:03:26.419 
think that it was this family

00:03:26.419 --> 00:03:30.140 
think that it was this family
relationship<00:03:27.530> tangent<00:03:28.639> that<00:03:29.639> kind<00:03:29.970> of

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
relationship tangent that kind of

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:34.330 
relationship tangent that kind of
separates<00:03:30.720> this<00:03:30.930> story<00:03:31.290> from<00:03:31.859> all<00:03:32.340> the<00:03:32.909> other

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:34.340 
separates this story from all the other

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:35.929 
separates this story from all the other
