00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:06.660
 0e the tv the high tech news and you 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.670
 know we're still on the 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.300
 latest courses on the latest news 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.460
 High-tech 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.259
 it was announced yesterday we talk about it 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:22.769
 already it's the new htc one 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:24.689
 this is the n8 and here is a smartphone of 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:28.470
 plus a smartphone under android like 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.130
 you like them very luxurious this htc one m 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.099
 8 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.630
 with its all-aluminum look these of 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.969
 Polished aluminum I'm delighted it's good 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.380
 this is true we are talking about the look of the 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.450
 htc law but it's true that this one 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.170
 has finally already the previous month htc was 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.200
 probably one of the most beautiful 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.579
 smartphones and it was often compared 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.940
 with the highest smartphones of 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.010
 range 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:50.309
 so here it is htc handed over with 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:52.320
 this one realizing 4 90% is 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.340
 metal actually an impressive then 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.960
 the disadvantage is that it is a little 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.000
 heavier and 60 g 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.879
 we can not have everything lightness and then 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.340
 aspect solidity and luxury the screen is 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.320
 enlarge the 35 inches against 4.6 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.790
 previously and so with what's being done 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.790
 better in processor 1 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.810
 this is the last Dragon 801 snap yeah 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.670
 it's actually the real big 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.920
 particularity of this new device 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.500
 while he says more beefy processors 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.060
 abadie cosco battery also so 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.119
 we go up a bit in power but despite 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:23.490
 everything is fine despite this processor without 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.530
 doubt greedy elia htc ad 40% 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.930
 of autonomy in addition very much last 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.829
 version of android 4.4.2 this is the 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.729
 version that fit so and then side 

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:34.560
 audio and video because it's really 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.759
 the strong points htc one 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.900
 this was the case already with 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.939
 the impressive version and it will be 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.130
 still the case with this new hc 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:42.210
 really focused on the quality of the 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.759
 its picture quality 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.659
 a novelty it's good you know that 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.189
 it's fashionable and the one is leaking right now 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.200
 we are all here but I can more and where 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:51.540
 this is great, so here is a 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.729
 5 megapixel camera in 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:56.280
 frontal awards we will be able to do pretty 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:58.500
 it's better than on the galaxy s 5 and 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.960
 it's better than on the xperia z2 de sony 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.909
 here and then another novelty in 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.219
 of photo on the back of the camera two 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:06.750
 goals why well because that's 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:09.390
 also it's a big trend in photography 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.740
 the luxury of putting the 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.180
 point 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:12.350
 after or at least you know you 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.940
 take a picture and then after you 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:15.170
 blur the background is beautiful it's 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.390
 beautiful is a little what we can 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:19.130
 to have on the SLR we can find 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:21.380
 this feature on the galaxy s 5 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:22.790
 she comes to cello case also lo 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:23.810
 this is the case they also happen so 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:25.460
 at htc 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:27.230
 with this particularity it's a bit of a 

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:28.550
 UFO a double camera to 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.320
 the back of a phone if I believe that 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:32.240
 it's the first time we see that 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:34.760
 what should allow for this system 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:36.200
 rpt focus after that he still a 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:37.340
 better quality compared to what 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.620
 already exist but in addition they are 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:42.230
 cameras that are not necessarily 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:44.570
 huge in terms of pixels since we at 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:45.680
 1 2 and 1 4 megapixels let's go 

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:48.560
 was waiting for me so what's going on 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:50.120
 but in fact htc had developed this 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.710
 technology for the previous phone 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.850
 actually the pixels are bigger at yes 

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:54.470
 it's their story of ultra pixels 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:56.330
 this is called ultra pixels which 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:57.740
 fact that we still have a very very 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:59.600
 nice picture quality with less than 

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:01.100
 pixels and especially beautiful photos 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:03.050
 in low light this is the 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:05.330
 peculiarity of this system ultra peaks 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:08.030
 and then in video htc our ads from 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:09.020
 slow motion means slow motion 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:11.750
 1080p 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:13.160
 it will dump his race that's the 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:15.080
 particularity also this phone is 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:17.030
 that he has loud speakers who are in 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:18.530
 facade and what is interesting it is 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:19.100
 is also the case with the htc 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:20.570
 one 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:22.640
 when you watch a video in 

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:24.020
 horizontal you have a real stereo sound 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:26.090
 which is impressive for a TV movie 

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:27.590
 older and that's another particularity it's 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:28.730
 that he has a dual stereo mic and when 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:30.710
 you for example you take videos 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:32.570
 of concerts you have a real take of 

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:33.560
 his stereo me who loves the sound as much 

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:35.360
 to tell you that it dumps 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:37.430
 so they double turns one by one 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:39.770
 forget there he has two cameras 2 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:42.050
 loudspeaker microphones here it is 

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:43.310
 would miss more than a second screen that 

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:46.250
 may be for the next version 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:50.030
 hey he has something extra, too, it's a 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:51.110
 micro slot sd well increase the size 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:52.850
 memory and time other 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:54.710
 particularity works with a nano 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:56.990
 sim so it's maps too maple 

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:58.100
 finally who says reserved only at apple 

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:59.260
 so far there is still very little 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:01.330
 phone that 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:03.220
 actually profits from this new 

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:04.900
 target it's going to be even more of a mess 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:05.170
 so we want to switch from a phone to 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:06.189
 the other 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:09.430
 we challenge a lot as much you 

00:04:06.189 --> 00:04:10.900
 to say that it's a real puzzle 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:12.760
 ends with the colors so it is 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:15.519
 available in gray it out a little bit 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:16.630
 later in gold here is to say that he 

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:18.220
 there were more physical pimples that 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:20.410
 are in place and only by 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:21.940
 virtual buttons built into android that's it 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:23.500
 he will be released on April 10 in France he is 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:25.870
 already available in the United States and he 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:28.030
 will cost how much between 600 and 700 euros 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:29.229
 we will say here without subsidy naked but 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:29.590
 it's really a top phone 

00:04:29.229 --> 00:04:33.639
 range 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:36.699
 and if the case here for the htc one m 8 

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:37.900
 as soon as it's released when it's announced 

00:04:36.699 --> 00:04:40.150
 discover on 01net 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:42.310
 this is the test happens very soon we 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:42.580
 will talk again very quickly on 0 net 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:45.120
 TV 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:45.120
 Hi everybody
