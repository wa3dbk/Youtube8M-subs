00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.389

 in this little corner until night legislation 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.570
 This was my first reading of the 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.730
 literary marathon of winter so I 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.640
 I started to pair with this reading 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.769
 I read in two days went well. 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:29.160
 so I had read 70 pages 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:31.590
 where 280 in the other then so I am 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.140
 he could read so much if it were too 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.270
 well, man is very good and he managed 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.640
 280 pages after working the day 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.190
 whole morning and then law 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.809
 Imagine is very good. 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.730
 of course it is a literature 100 for 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.969
 who likes war of 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.800
 blood of heads rolling at last 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.360
 kind of thing then if you like this 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.170
 kind of a book or this is a book to 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.870
 you 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.879
 this book was published by arsae box 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.829
 I think I'm not mistaken last year. 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.210
 is part of a trilogy of the call 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.680
 trilogy of thorns 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:06.360
 This is the first prince of 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:09.270
 thrones the second is the chem donations and 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.729
 then the Horford Empire which has a 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.830
 image entities know where it has sent 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:16.860
 here the first was by software 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:19.680
 the deaths which invented the inter-tone 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:22.979
 so we 're three books there since 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:25.560
 following the saga of this 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:28.290
 spinelli item that is the young then the 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:31.170
 story begins when the young man flees 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:33.540
 from home after having home bills without 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.520
 Castle address in after 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.070
 happened a great tragedy in the life 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.110
 He and his family were very young. 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.720
 He was nine when this 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.909
 happened then he got very 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.890
 traumatized by this situation he 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:51.030
 still today 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:53.310
 but I understand it's a dream about it, it stays 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.880
 very tousled with the record that happened 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.430
 huh 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.590
 and then he rebelled and fled 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.250
 of houses with 10 years or more 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.590
 thing like that 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:05.130
 he fled in the castle and without telling 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:07.710
 nobody joins a galley without 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:11.640
 a troupe of much older men 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:14.940
 warriors like that and kind of wanderers 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:17.030
 An end joins this galera they will 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:20.520
 winning there from village to village 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:23.129
 behind more power to conquer the 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:25.440
 places to conquer more or 

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:27.480
 more women anyway, this is a lot 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.520
 interesting story because people 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:32.879
 sees everything from the point of view of the 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:34.140
 young he has I think 12 13 years no 

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:36.420
 He is 15 years old. 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:39.390
 in this story and he is very mature he 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:42.780
 he already speaks like that to the 15 already that to be 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:45.540
 profitable then he realizes this sound 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:48.090
 want to master everything and it's not just 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:49.920
 to serve he wants to be an entrepreneur of everything 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:52.860
 It understood because it is very powerful. 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:56.400
 He has a lot of influence with this galley. 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:59.700
 he is walking and he has a lot of 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:02.430
 You know, it's his will on this galley. 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:05.099
 they rely on everything else for their posture 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:07.220
 that he has imposed himself is like the leader 

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:10.709
 them and he is extremely cruel 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:11.310
 extremely messy so 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:13.500
 tell 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:14.610
 so do not pity anyone, he does not know 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:17.010
 matter with anyone 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:18.930
 he has no affection without truth for 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:22.470
 no one else, though he has a 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:25.739
 certain affection for some of his colleagues 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:28.739
 he's still there, he still 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:30.930
 so if it's to conquer things 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:33.000
 for them it was to do his will 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:37.319
 he can quickly forget this 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:39.989
 you know who you are a lot is everything in 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:42.239
 environment that you want to facilitate 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:44.610
 enter no one just wants to solve a part 

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:49.170
 it is a story that involves erring 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:51.060
 fight in the battle of quarrels up to 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:53.790
 fantasy because it has some elements 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:57.330
 as witches understood this and some 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:58.860
 creatures also have supernatural 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:01.069
 the elements of fantasy but I do not 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:05.269
 I felt that this is very strong, not like that. 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:07.849
 focus the focus is more so the george and the life 

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:08.719
 him the things he wants to conquer and the 

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:10.280
 war 

00:04:08.719 --> 00:04:12.200
 so awesome is happening 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:14.689
 between the realms there are several 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:17.780
 other realms and there is a question 

00:04:14.689 --> 00:04:21.169
 politics, too, that so-and-so forgives 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:23.810
 So, this is why there are alliances 

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:25.340
 understood and he is actually in the 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:27.530
 half of it all but he does not want to know 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:30.020
 He does not want to reign either. 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:33.410
 destroy everyone who is to be king 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:36.169
 I loved reading people like this but I 

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:38.900
 I think I intend to read the others. 

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:40.849
 I want the trilogy books and tell 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:42.410
 I also that I found what I think 

00:04:40.849 --> 00:04:44.840
 so the character has a lot to do 

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:47.660
 still develop because it is still 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:51.470
 very young and he is still young. 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:54.199
 still give indications that perhaps keeping 

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:55.639
 a good character a personality a 

00:04:54.199 --> 00:04:57.440
 A little cooler than it is 

00:04:55.639 --> 00:04:59.840
 showing here I do not know why sir 

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:02.360
 can worsen and become chaos right 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:04.160
 later in the other books but he is a 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:05.930
 very interesting character you have 

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:08.900
 that relationship of love and hatred with him 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:11.630
 You know I do not know if I like I twist to 

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:16.580
 he or I get angry at things 

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:18.770
 who makes boys me because sometimes he knows 

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:21.530
 so , at the same time as you 

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:22.400
 like him is giving everything everything 

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:27.080
 good 

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:29.360
 out of nowhere he does something well think 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:31.849
 that you stay like that for a living with him 

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:33.320
 so it's a really cool book I liked 

00:05:31.849 --> 00:05:35.900
 enough reading experience has been 

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:36.860
 very good so I recommend passage to 

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:38.479
 you too 

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:40.490
 So this is it, folks, did you like the 

00:05:38.479 --> 00:05:42.139
 review of prinz options gave the shot 

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:45.169
 below help spread my work 

00:05:42.139 --> 00:05:47.469
 on social networks and that is better and 

00:05:45.169 --> 00:05:47.469
 the next
