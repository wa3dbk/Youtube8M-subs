00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:12.559
 with tejera for consoles libraries 

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:14.510
 I bring you a couple quite ethical 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:17.119
 already one on the one hand is very funny and 

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:19.039
 the other is amazing light 3 private 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:20.539
 is super q rise inter 20 looks like 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:22.159
 very much to a comparison that I have 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:23.839
 thought of the one I remember in the first place 

00:00:22.159 --> 00:00:25.279
 is going to teach here the graciosillo that a 

00:00:23.839 --> 00:00:26.599
 requested commission can give us in 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:28.069
 the screen unfortunately I will 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:30.050
 just under the description always 

00:00:28.069 --> 00:00:31.999
 I leave you down there I will put you I guess mode 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:33.559
 1 and good module I will put the name of the 

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:34.820
 mod and below the other name and is to put 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:36.680
 the images and then also what 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:38.239
 I'll put the video in case you want to see these 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:41.149
 mod in action so to speak 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:43.219
 first of all I bring you the first one 

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:44.719
 is the funniest so to speak in the 

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:49.100
 which we see a wheelchair with a 

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:53.199
 lady in a wheelchair and it's weird 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:55.789
 rare example at the same time funny and 

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:58.429
 as if this wheelchair were 

00:00:55.789 --> 00:01:00.019
 tucked inside the skin of a motorcycle and 

00:00:58.429 --> 00:01:01.550
 it goes there as if the woman were 

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:02.539
 driving the wheelchair is 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:04.280
 amazing 

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:06.260
 a lot of gas in this way is 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.920
 incredible the saw is super super 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.689
 curred 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.490
 I think it's good I have not seen many 

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:12.049
 wheelchairs by gta 5 I guess that 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:16.189
 will have taken from a hospital or something from 

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:17.869
 that but good as you see this posture 

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:19.850
 basically it's a motorcycle stuck in the 

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:21.350
 skin of a chair from what they have done 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.270
 is to change the texture and we have the one 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:24.409
 this mod is also characteristic 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.210
 is that he has not been driven by a person 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:28.039
 anyone but a lady and plan yes 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.080
 no clothes the wta that is not very nice 

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:31.880
 to see but good 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:33.200
 that 's good so leave it under the 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:33.830
 description if you want to give it a 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.149
 glance 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:37.549
 we go with the second one in which we can 

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:39.679
 see something amazing 

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:41.750
 it's a motorcycle in this mode to me more 

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:43.399
 remembered as the bike is of the 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.869
 star wars movies yes yes 

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:45.950
 indeed you know you remember that motorcycle 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:47.299
 that there was good you already know that the movie 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.640
 of star wars as a kind of career 

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:51.649
 of this strange galactic engine and the 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.630
 you see that most remember a lot they are 

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:54.979
 same is identical and as it is because it is 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.840
 incredible it is that if they destined it 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:58.729
 some wheels that the other way that has 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.950
 recorded before formula one of the 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:03.500
 same and apart then we see that that has 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.959
 super long has yes cannons to the 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:08.679
 sides has also up in the middle like 

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:08.679
 a superhero in plan 

00:02:10.299 --> 00:02:15.680
 giant 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:17.630
 with many years as if I could shoot 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.490
 well I think it can trigger interest 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:21.650
 incredible I really can not stop the 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:25.280
 picture below the description to throw a 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:27.370
 look and it's very cool my favorite is 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:30.380
 incredible calls me a lot of attention 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:33.110
 so long is this long walk and 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:34.700
 it's really cool there's an attic basically 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:36.260
 all of all the description as I say 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:38.590
 they are super cured this honestly I 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.590
