00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
got max 15 hours on it I'd say it's

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.840

than 80s do or 85 and they really thrash
the<00:00:57.059> stock<00:00:57.329> chain<00:00:57.600> of<00:00:57.719> sprockets<00:00:58.079> because

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
the stock chain of sprockets because

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:59.990 
the stock chain of sprockets because
they're<00:00:58.350> the<00:00:58.739> real<00:00:58.949> cheap<00:00:59.190> real<00:00:59.609> cheap<00:00:59.820> made

they're the real cheap real cheap made

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.450 
they're the real cheap real cheap made
shayna<00:01:00.510> sprockets<00:01:01.020> that<00:01:01.140> they<00:01:01.199> stretch<00:01:01.500> and

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
shayna sprockets that they stretch and

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.140 
shayna sprockets that they stretch and
they<00:01:03.149> just<00:01:03.359> blow<00:01:03.570> through<00:01:03.840> them<00:01:04.549> within<00:01:05.549> 30<00:01:05.850> 40

they just blow through them within 30 40

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.120 
they just blow through them within 30 40
hours<00:01:06.450> so<00:01:06.720> this<00:01:07.260> is<00:01:07.470> still<00:01:07.650> the<00:01:07.740> original

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
hours so this is still the original

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.870 
hours so this is still the original
chain<00:01:08.310> sprocket<00:01:08.549> so<00:01:09.240> it<00:01:09.360> is<00:01:09.450> a<00:01:09.479> low<00:01:09.659> hours<00:01:09.930> bike

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:10.880 
chain sprocket so it is a low hours bike

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.370 
chain sprocket so it is a low hours bike
it's<00:01:11.880> never<00:01:12.060> been<00:01:12.180> apart<00:01:12.450> it's<00:01:13.140> got<00:01:13.290> the

it's been 100 and 140 psi crank pressure
to<00:02:35.590> a<00:02:35.620> gauge<00:02:35.980> ever<00:02:36.280> since<00:02:36.489> we<00:02:36.610> got<00:02:36.640> it<00:02:36.910> and

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
to a gauge ever since we got it and

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:38.790 
to a gauge ever since we got it and
that's<00:02:37.420> what<00:02:37.630> this<00:02:37.750> one<00:02:37.900> puts<00:02:38.080> out<00:02:38.230> the<00:02:38.620> top

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:38.800 
that's what this one puts out the top

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.940 
that's what this one puts out the top

kind<00:02:47.320> of<00:02:47.350> how<00:02:47.470> you<00:02:47.530> can<00:02:47.650> tell<00:02:47.799> to<00:02:48.010> us<00:02:48.160> if<00:02:48.640> a<00:02:48.970> bike

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
kind of how you can tell to us if a bike

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:52.259 
kind of how you can tell to us if a bike
two<00:02:49.930> stroke<00:02:50.140> doesn't<00:02:50.260> idle<00:02:50.739> good<00:02:51.030> it's<00:02:52.030> a<00:02:52.090> nice

00:02:52.259 --> 00:02:52.269 
two stroke doesn't idle good it's a nice

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:55.410 
two stroke doesn't idle good it's a nice
weak<00:02:52.600> compression<00:02:53.340> but<00:02:54.340> I<00:02:54.700> said<00:02:55.150> it's<00:02:55.299> not

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
weak compression but I said it's not

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:58.500 
weak compression but I said it's not
it's<00:02:56.200> not<00:02:56.320> beat<00:02:56.560> up<00:02:56.709> in<00:02:56.860> any<00:02:57.010> any<00:02:57.970> sense<00:02:58.299> of<00:02:58.450> the

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510 
it's not beat up in any any sense of the

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:01.229 
it's not beat up in any any sense of the
word<00:02:58.540> wasn't<00:02:59.470> abused<00:02:59.950> wasn't<00:03:00.400> an<00:03:00.610> X<00:03:00.790> race<00:03:01.000> bike

00:03:01.229 --> 00:03:01.239 
word wasn't abused wasn't an X race bike

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:02.400 
word wasn't abused wasn't an X race bike
and<00:03:01.480> that's<00:03:01.600> what<00:03:01.720> we<00:03:01.810> look<00:03:01.959> for<00:03:01.989> when<00:03:02.200> we

some wear and tear on him fast so like I
said<00:03:21.820> I<00:03:21.880> wanted<00:03:22.120> the<00:03:22.180> bike<00:03:22.299> that<00:03:22.510> was<00:03:22.570> original

00:03:23.039 --> 00:03:23.049 
said I wanted the bike that was original

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:25.380 
said I wanted the bike that was original
never<00:03:23.260> been<00:03:23.410> apart<00:03:23.680> and<00:03:24.670> get<00:03:24.820> shape<00:03:25.030> to<00:03:25.150> start

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:25.390 
never been apart and get shape to start

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:26.580 
never been apart and get shape to start
with<00:03:25.510> so<00:03:25.660> we<00:03:25.750> found<00:03:25.989> this<00:03:26.079> one<00:03:26.260> up<00:03:26.440> in

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
with so we found this one up in

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:29.370 
with so we found this one up in
Sacramento<00:03:26.980> when<00:03:27.430> we<00:03:27.549> bought<00:03:27.730> it<00:03:28.049> and<00:03:29.049> like<00:03:29.350> I

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:29.380 
Sacramento when we bought it and like I

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:32.390 
Sacramento when we bought it and like I
said<00:03:29.500> she's<00:03:30.000> changed<00:03:31.000> her<00:03:31.060> mind<00:03:31.209> as<00:03:31.390> far<00:03:31.420> as

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
said she's changed her mind as far as

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.610 
said she's changed her mind as far as
pursuing<00:03:33.400> riding<00:03:34.239> there's<00:03:34.450> some<00:03:34.600> gear<00:03:34.870> that

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:35.620 
pursuing riding there's some gear that

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:37.770 
pursuing riding there's some gear that
goes<00:03:35.650> with<00:03:36.040> it<00:03:36.070> or<00:03:36.640> you<00:03:36.730> it<00:03:37.299> will<00:03:37.390> fit<00:03:37.570> you<00:03:37.720> or

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 
goes with it or you it will fit you or

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:40.080 
goes with it or you it will fit you or
whatever<00:03:37.900> it's<00:03:38.170> some<00:03:38.440> Alpine<00:03:39.220> star<00:03:39.430> boots<00:03:39.730> I

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.090 
whatever it's some Alpine star boots I

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:42.090 
whatever it's some Alpine star boots I
think<00:03:40.720> they're<00:03:40.840> like<00:03:40.959> tech<00:03:41.230> sixes<00:03:41.650> in<00:03:41.769> a<00:03:41.860> size

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:42.100 
think they're like tech sixes in a size

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:45.840 
think they're like tech sixes in a size
10<00:03:42.549> and<00:03:42.820> then<00:03:43.630> a<00:03:43.769> medium<00:03:44.769> helmet<00:03:45.340> that<00:03:45.640> she

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:45.850 
10 and then a medium helmet that she

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:48.479 
10 and then a medium helmet that she
bought<00:03:46.090> new<00:03:46.390> last<00:03:47.200> season's<00:03:47.560> got<00:03:47.709> like<00:03:48.129> two

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:48.489 
bought new last season's got like two

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:49.920 
bought new last season's got like two
rides<00:03:48.730> on<00:03:48.940> it<00:03:49.060> cuz<00:03:49.209> she<00:03:49.239> actually<00:03:49.480> used<00:03:49.750> one<00:03:49.900> of
