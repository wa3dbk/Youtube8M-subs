00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
villains but trenderhoof I feel is a

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.510 
villains but trenderhoof I feel is a
good<00:01:01.109> step<00:01:01.590> back<00:01:01.920> into<00:01:02.129> the<00:01:02.309> right<00:01:02.460> direction

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
good step back into the right direction

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.840 
good step back into the right direction
maybe<00:01:03.449> not<00:01:03.690> a<00:01:03.719> big<00:01:04.320> step<00:01:04.830> but<00:01:05.309> a<00:01:05.339> step

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
maybe not a big step but a step

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.670 
maybe not a big step but a step
nonetheless<00:01:06.119> one<00:01:06.960> of<00:01:07.080> the<00:01:07.200> more<00:01:07.380> frequent
