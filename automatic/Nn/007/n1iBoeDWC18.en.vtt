 This after Datte Then Now and Silver Nao Jo opening of 8 white I Ezaki table that haste 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:16.420
 I flew a little with a pawn, but this kind of attacker is also included 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:18.720
 I think that beginners think that it should be good if they look at this and learn how to use 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:18.720
 Don 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:28.669
 I will go to the second box 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:30.600
 8 is also Once hardened in a do well is written in this kind of wind to violence who we have that contains the capture plant 

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:32.470
 There is determined like it summoned 

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:36.910
 I do not feel 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:38.140
 I wonder if this is Miki and play sheets again 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:42.170
 U 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:46.120
 Yes Well Well it is such a feeling Well 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:46.120
 It is said that this star mark is absolutely attached 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:52.860
 I do not seem to be caught in the selection 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:04.210
 This hero is not 's Toka gravel of this screwdriver gar 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:04.210
 Uh these two snares 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.290
 And this 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:15.659
 It looks like this I have a hairstyle together 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:20.500
 Well some of the grain street here is 8 armed-centric 8 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:24.100
 I thought that I was not at armed center in defense 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:25.770
 At the same time, it is mainly defensive 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:30.899
 It entered It is specifically 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:32.969
 Eight man who can fight against the Red Man is overwhelmed, but the heavy armor broke through by Ultimate 

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:36.700
 I have become able to 

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:39.870
 White 's defense has fallen a bit 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:41.310
 It is Mr. thunder wind how 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:43.800
 8 Today 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.920
 Yes 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:50.390
 I haven't entered a name at all, but for now it's a good idea 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.390
 It will be sub trump 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:58.810
 First why why now participate in the Greater Ultimate power plus 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:03.340
 It is a subtle wood grain 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:05.259
 Oh, I can't use the Speed ​​Plus effect for Ultimate, so Alti 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:07.090
 Fine or Mettopo use of 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:11.510
 Verso shield 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:13.780
 It's a burst, you can do it just before you can be a bus partner 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:13.780
 8 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:21.660
 If it 's a burst, it 's a burst, it's a delta barrier 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:24.470
 I use burst low delta barrier effects are together 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:28.660
 And one just wait a minute 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:28.660
 There was a post on the deck of short notes 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:38.780
 I worked hard to see the Boso after Ottotto 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:43.970
 So shad play the Do not feel called moves to attack from harden the 8 defense 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:46.940
 And Well that's it, please for the time being put Valhalla Nsu example value ordering uneven version Srei 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:49.150
 Or put more because consolidate to remain in the neighborhood 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:54.620
 Well, you're after 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:59.720
 Even though the flower has no name , Ultimate is really cool This symbol is- 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:03:05.659
 ? Yes, a little come Ultimate era from this is I do not know Well 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:06.200
 Honestly the possibility that the card with 6 or more cost is flipped is overwhelmingly more likely to be won 

00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:08.710
 That's why 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:12.400
 I did not read this for a moment 

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:14.760
 8 Ultimate trigger hit and the pouring speed is too high but blocked 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.760
 No school 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:21.510
 Wait a minute afraid 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:21.510
 In the case of fun 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:30.420
 Well all right 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:35.960
 Naoah ー But which one 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:39.250
 Here is the life of block correction 

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:39.250
 Cats are not blocked 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:51.260
 It floats and it depends on your own bp and it will go to 20,000 steps 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:56.840
 In short , if you're here, the other party 's 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:58.819
 When I was blocked from this on the map diagonally I said to the opponent while destroying this 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:02.480
 I give it and it's strong 

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:05.060
 Conversely, if you attack when item b is high, you may 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:07.319
 It is said that I can go through and I will remain 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:08.720
 I thought I wonder if you about Son 

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:11.200
 Yes 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:11.200
 I suppose 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:22.860
 Well depending on the situation I can not say which one is stronger 

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:24.690
 A ik forward to once again the original is a personal it does not might be better of red Well in power 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:30.370
 Turn over while removing 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:33.090
 Brave Well this what at about here is not blocked in the matter 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:33.090
 Play Pu 

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:37.120
 Can't Brave 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:47.780
 8 Can I not Break Ultimate ? 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:47.780
 Because the course target is written as cost 4 abnormal speed Brave Kita Shiga 

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:55.000
 If you think that things can't be brave to Ultimate, you're better off 

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:58.360
 I feel like it's good 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:00.169
 Tashiro guess there is a taxel worth Well wearing Well that bp 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:04.969
 Entered because I'm not locked 

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:08.360
 Here the change is he cutting is still one point when and You're west 9 bp was lower try Mars 

00:05:04.969 --> 00:05:13.249
 There is no so I can remove my opponent or leave me alone 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:17.230
 There is a possibility but it means that oneself may be destroyed 

00:05:13.249 --> 00:05:20.470
 Well, anyway, I can't say which way to go 

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:25.920
 Not a release is better church because both Well this time 

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:25.920
 Thank you for viewing in the second-hand Yes I was opened
