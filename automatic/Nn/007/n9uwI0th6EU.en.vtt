00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:01.900
 for bright and high-contrast and above all energy-saving 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:03.450
 DisplaySearch 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:07.460

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:08.030

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:28.320
 Klatt from portrait to landscape 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.780

 no one kept the samples dragging percent 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:02.280
 the times are changing and 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.660
 photos 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:06.660
 then I have a punch for my contacts 

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:14.089
 at half past eight clock Wunderman Museum must watch one 

00:02:14.089 --> 00:02:17.619
 There are several trailers not going right to show a way 

00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:22.339
 and my World Clock kids are still at the new contacts 

00:02:22.339 --> 00:02:25.339
 benefited around groups 

00:02:26.469 --> 00:02:30.619
 Son and Enz come over integration 

00:02:30.619 --> 00:02:33.129
 one that is not labeled at all 

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:36.200
 a pretest you just have to remember it is not extra 

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:42.189
 Moguenara at Hahl important calendar contacts music company releases 

00:02:42.189 --> 00:02:43.709
 photos 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:45.719
 and how store 

00:02:45.719 --> 00:02:46.830
 a search 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:49.309
 systemic 

00:02:49.309 --> 00:02:51.409
 programs 

00:02:51.409 --> 00:02:53.039
 too often my hurt 

00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:56.039
 threatened the knife 

00:02:58.509 --> 00:03:02.919
 I'm the keys up here so this little Alexa is fine 

00:03:02.919 --> 00:03:03.839
 would get 

00:03:03.839 --> 00:03:05.509
 10 percent 5 

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:08.779
 a website with not so good around 

00:03:08.779 --> 00:03:12.789
 their reasons so that very smooth in the middle by Rutschmann Leichnams 

00:03:12.789 --> 00:03:14.789
 in the country 

00:03:14.789 --> 00:03:17.789
 But it was the coffers now give it a try 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:30.059
 I have to say 

00:03:30.059 --> 00:03:31.959
 the go finally works not 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:36.009
 So in the percent you do not realize at all if you were pressed 

00:03:36.009 --> 00:03:37.489
 very very hard 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:41.190
 and the long war no real Sanofi PC can not really be 

00:03:41.189 --> 00:03:42.060
 to press 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:45.489
 what happens is what happens when I see them suppressed, but they go 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:47.559
 really down 

00:03:47.559 --> 00:03:51.159
 Your Mr there you can certainly get used to over time but 

00:03:51.969 --> 00:03:54.429
 and for me that would not change anything 

00:03:54.429 --> 00:03:57.849
 You also have to watch out for Jung to open the fast 

00:03:58.409 --> 00:03:59.669
 tight under 

00:03:59.669 --> 00:04:01.579
 and unfortunately adds 

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:02.999
 but that is for sure 

00:04:02.999 --> 00:04:05.209
 instead of snow a habituation thing 

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:08.389
 he works as you know you do not know if you do not press anything 

00:04:08.389 --> 00:04:09.959
 or not 

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:12.819
 Something is still called noticed that Mini 

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:15.219
 it is unfortunately the 

00:04:15.219 --> 00:04:17.159
 Mr. Fast then 

00:04:17.159 --> 00:04:20.340
 wobbly is so 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:22.150
 he lets himself here already 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:25.180
 there are already decided four games 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:27.289
 So who cares so much for processing 

00:04:27.289 --> 00:04:30.400
 otherwise the knee is enough if the deadline pressure
