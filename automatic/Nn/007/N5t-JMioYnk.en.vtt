00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:10.950
 hello with you Elena and good 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.170
 recipes 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:16.080
 and I offer you an unusual recipe with 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.830
 seedlings masha it will march with 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.080
 vegetables 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:22.710
 I will use the following vegetables 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.580
 I have two small carrots 1 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:28.200
 eggplant 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:31.260
 two small green peppers and a piece 

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:33.120
 ginger and of course germinated march 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.940
 it is very easy to germinate 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:39.239
 I soaked her she on what a deep bowl 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:42.329
 then merged the water and laid out a march here 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:46.670
 here on this dish covered with a towel 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:49.140
 waffle like that I had closed and 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:53.429
 towel I occasionally watered 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:56.039
 water and like this for three days I have this Masha 

00:00:53.429 --> 00:00:58.940
 here about got here such germs on 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:01.440
 it appeared and now you can eat 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:03.120
 I want to immediately say what I expect 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.060
 comments about what 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.280
 Masha seedlings need to eat raw but it 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.020
 really not necessarily in asian 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.820
 the kitchen seedlings Masha very wide 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.820
 used in cooking various 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:17.790
 dishes and I personally like to eat them 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:20.219
 stewed than raw stewed sprouts 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:23.039
 get much tastier although raw 

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:26.240
 certainly more useful also need 

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:31.259
 some vegetable oil salt and water 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:34.430
 carrots cut into slices of eggplant 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.430
 also cut into circles 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:53.830
 i will need a little ginger 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:56.040
 I will cut off a piece and clean it from 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:56.040
 peel 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.640
 About such a piece is enough not to 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:25.930
 it was too urgent now need it 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:29.340
 chop up very finely 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:32.040
 cooking oil 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:37.650
 about 2 tablespoons 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:37.650
 lightly fried eggplants and carrots 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:43.240
 if you are very afraid of roasting 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.980
 You can of course skip this step and 

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:49.900
 just pour a little water and 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:53.790
 put out eggplants with carrots now 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:53.790
 add pepper and ginger here 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:09.190
 shuffle we post seedlings here 

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:09.190
 Masha we add some salt 

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:17.100
 add a little hot some water I 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:17.100
 add somewhere milliliters 80100 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:27.730
 mix seedlings masha with vegetables 

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:29.440
 Now close the pan with a lid and 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:33.510
 simmer it all on low heat 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:33.510
 about 10-15 minutes 

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:46.819
