00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:14.570
 Yes Hello is the point of garnet 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:18.380
 About Hey 9 many is today 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:20.080
 I think that I have been playing various replays of games until now 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:24.990
 For here 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:32.630
 From practice to practice in competition 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:39.050
 I would like to send you the introductory part this time . 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:41.200
 Hey there is a lot of permanent, but suddenly take 4 healers and Maoh this hoge 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:45.460
 Practice 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:50.980
 Also I think it is not recommended but I think also there better to 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:56.260
 The reason is that the influence is still that other tactics and selfish The song is quite 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:01:01.190
 I think there are a lot of hybrids who have failed for the first time in the actual battle, though 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:03.260
 I think that there are similar tips and absolute tips 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:07.070
 So there about 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:11.710
 I would like to tell you more 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:11.710
 Then I would like to introduce play with one eye 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:21.619
 Let's go in and see 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:23.010
 First of all , practice with the organization called Giant and Archer when you want 8 healers 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:29.070
 Please give me 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:32.450
 The healer suddenly makes sure that the recovery is no more than 8 resistance 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:39.690
 Please try to put out little by little 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:44.460
 Please do a Patsy Reside cut with Giant and Ann for the upper side. 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:45.760
 By doing so, unity Archer Queen is flowing down, but by this 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.510
 The 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:53.970
 Oh , does it take this much time to walk the arrival staff ? 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:02:01.160
 Please remember that as an experience 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:02:01.160
 Make the archer plunge into the middle where it turns down 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:09.450
 Yes Yeah a like this 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:16.769
 At first it is 9th place princess 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:19.440
 Wearing on the body where you say proceed in the direction that I thought that inadvertently take the dark elixir 

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:22.130
 Please 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:26.920
 The other so different from the competition 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:33.360
 And side cut firmly both the facility in giant Archer 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:40.100
 I think it would be better to practice where you can go in the direction you want to go properly 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:40.100
 Yes for the next replay, it will be replayed when it did not go well 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:48.890
 Let's see 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:51.510
 I put out the queen, put out the healer, and I cut the top side 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:55.379
 There is no side cut 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:03:01.819
 As the bottom side is scattered and the birds are far 

00:02:55.379 --> 00:03:01.819
 It is a pattern'd end around on without change even to the color turned down 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:10.380
 If it is already that way , then you have already opened the middle and rushed into the middle 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:14.400
 Let's go 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:18.530
 Healer without a problem because the tired eight-mer 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.530
 Acha click us digs up in the 

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:30.650
 Body is also the recovery of the power to say I keep studying by this kind of play to that failure Netto 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:36.610
 I think it is very good because it 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:39.790
 The possibility of one star is very high if you make a mistake in the direction of 9 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:45.579
 I think it's a risky tactic 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:48.560
 The ability Tteyuu turn in the direction you want to turn Well of recovery way since put the firm only 

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:53.810
 I want to live 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:59.690
 I would like to review the points so far 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:04:02.580
 First one eye was again conflict you fart direction want to turn the winter 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:07.330
 Please remember this 

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:12.940
 Then remember the amount healer recovered 

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:15.550
 Where this is that bought What happens when what the case multiplied by the letters healer was 4 body 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:22.400
 Remember 

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:26.750
 I think that this is very important to know the pattern of failure in the end 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:29.740
 Why did you fail then why did you go to the other side ? 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:29.740
 I have died 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:37.620
 If you don't remember it, it will end with a star 1 when you practice in a match 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:42.380
 Because there is 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:42.380
 Wow, please make sure to remember 

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:47.610
 Let's move on to the next step 

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:55.800
 Yes Yeah it is next 

00:04:51.169 --> 00:05:01.800
 It is a pattern to advance without making a side cut 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:06.139
 Take out the puncher quint and take out the healer and proceed in the direction you want to proceed without making a side cut 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:06.139
 Let's practice to be able 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:13.020
 First of all, the archer pile 

00:05:10.379 --> 00:05:16.370
 Though this is 

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:25.070
 I'm leaving a little right 

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:27.020
 When I put it out from here, I broke two dark barracks, broke the query tank and broke the cannon. 

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:33.740
 It depends on the front 

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:37.040
 I'll destroy the last affair here, but this time only a little 

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:40.370
 Since the axis is shifted to the right 

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:48.229
 The queen then turns right 

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:50.590
 Queen after the facilities in and is it wall to walk to the right to the are out of the shaft on the right side 

00:05:48.229 --> 00:05:52.190
 To go 

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:56.600
 Yeah it This Is 

00:05:52.190 --> 00:06:00.040
 Precisely because where I'm now was the placement of the completely symmetrical 

00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:05.860
 We put a little closer to the right-hand side 

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:12.310
 If it is not symmetrical, it may be difficult to move in the opposite direction 

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:12.940
 Please remember to practice, for example, and rush it through the jump to Birkin and Tomokai center 

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:14.660
 To do 

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:18.190
 Let's practice 

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:24.850
 This will be a face-to-face player 

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:26.670
 Try grab the image to rush in the middle of the Queen merges with the main force with the jump 

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:32.210
 Please give me 

00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:37.169
 Well , I would like to review the points of the second step 

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:39.830
 In the direction you want to turn without one side cut 

00:06:37.169 --> 00:06:45.410
 Practice to rotate 

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:52.700
 In this regard, it is not the point whether you can turn the pile without side cutting 

00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:56.380
 Tteyuu Taka got it to the other side because of any facility in case you did not side cut 

00:06:52.700 --> 00:07:00.670
 Please remember the place as an experience value 

00:06:56.380 --> 00:07:05.510
 If you break this facility by doing so in practice 

00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:13.569
 I think I can get a sense of not turning to this side 

00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:17.870
 Next, please interact with the main unit and grab the image of jumping into the center by jumping 

00:07:13.569 --> 00:07:21.800
 Please practice the steps so far 

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:27.080
 As for this practice, while practicing permanent Daihiro 

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:30.289
 I 'm raising a char crew so Darquer Xur will stop bang 

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:33.100
 Because there are many exercises forever 

00:07:30.289 --> 00:07:38.240
 It is recommended by all means 

00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:41.900
 I think it seems that you won't lose even if you go around 100 times 

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:48.380
 At this time I would like the end see you in a place like this 

00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:52.870
 Next time , I would like to send you a practical version about perpetual features 

00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:52.870
 Then thank you for watching bye bye
