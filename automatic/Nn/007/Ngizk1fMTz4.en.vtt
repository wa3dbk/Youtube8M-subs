00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:15.559
 we are visiting in düsseldorf am 

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:17.660
 Flinger break the wsv guest at turu 

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:19.369
 düsseldorf and weser tv also has today 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:22.040
 again all gates all highlights 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:23.960
 prepared and there is a scene that 

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:26.500
 especially sent and especially heated 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.500
 has been 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.830
 No 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.100
 Aha 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.810
 under construction 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:13.379
 Yes 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:06.050
 marvin ellmann 1 3 lost at turu 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:07.670
 Dusseldorf is having such a nice day 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:08.840
 what could be there first birthday 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:11.420
 Happy birthday 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:12.260
 The U19 113 0 won this morning 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:13.610
 in Bonn 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.950
 but unfortunately we have the thing here 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:18.050
 certainly lost too 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:19.520
 decisive the scene to the 10 

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:21.440
 the elfmeter you will be on the field 

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:23.360
 see I can not because 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:25.819
 I think eighth player think 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:29.060
 very good in the chair rows of the duran 

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:30.709
 cross well we'll be late remembered 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.599
 that now one true or not true 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:33.380
 then I should not be able to judge me 

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:35.840
 Do not judge 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:37.970
 schiri whistles back not to hintersee 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.620
 therefore it is unfortunately so 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:41.390
 but everyone will see it in the 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:42.769
 slow motion again with wsv tv that is not 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:44.739
 It has been eleven meters that he has the ball 

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:46.730
 normally plays sour 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:48.140
 Nonetheless, there was compensation 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:50.209
 the 1 1 though in the second attempt 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:51.410
 scored a goal because of offside 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:53.660
 why do not you have it anyway ? 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:55.700
 I managed to turn the thing around 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:58.280
 that would turn off as possible but 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:00.319
 I just can not do it in the league 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:01.910
 only half as good no matter whom 

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:04.880
 if you play top player thomann 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:07.130
 give alleged non-competitors 

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:08.630
 then you have to call him everything 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:09.019
 today only have five minutes 

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:10.910
 made 

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:13.070
 but now it was enough 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:15.170
 week not and the beautiful is that the 

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:16.100
 on wednesday everything can turn in the 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:19.010
 positive senses 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:19.310
 there were on Wednesday three points to 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:21.470
 home 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:24.140
 was the wsv still undefeated the 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:25.460
 means check off what's said Wednesday 

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:27.320
 the next attempt against duisburg the 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:28.580
 means all hands set to zero then 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:31.450
 is it going on again on Wednesday 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:33.260
 certainly would have strength to refuel 

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:34.789
 tuesday on your monday 

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:36.590
 tuesday trade still time to rest 

00:04:34.789 --> 00:04:38.300
 and then we just want to go home too 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:39.740
 get back home three points because I 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:42.350
 We think we have huge potential in the industry 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:44.060
 team and we just belong with 

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:45.500
 above and a slip-up 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:48.020
 happens manager I hope that happens 

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:49.910
 not so often took good on saturday 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:50.210
 beat and then on Sunday again 

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:51.890
 game 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:53.870
 We are looking forward to the English weeks 

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:55.310
 you can quickly get everything back up 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:57.289
 set zero and earn points again 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:59.380
 now Sunday and then again as 

00:04:57.289 --> 00:05:02.090
 on wednesday and on sunday and because of that 

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:05.330
 we want to get three points so 

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:07.550
 we are the martina tonal ours 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:08.590
 chef coach thomas richter dws continued here 1 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:10.970
 2 3 lost 

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:12.620
 Let's go straight to the scene 

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:14.270
 very controversial was that was also funny 

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:15.770
 when seen in slow motion, too 

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:18.140
 Scene to the eleven here so that of the 

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:19.550
 Bank was good for me 

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:21.830
 no eleven meters is clearly playing the 

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:22.670
 So I saw it, but that's it 

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:25.910
 not decisive for me 

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:28.690
 Referee decisions are so too 

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:31.430
 accept as they are taken 

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:32.660
 that was today against us as I said but 

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:34.340
 for me is much more decisive 

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:36.410
 and we definitely have to go to the 

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:37.670
 own nose pack that we ever 

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:40.520
 did not get into the game well 

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:43.940
 that we are at the beginning and they are 

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:45.020
 we have become insecure again 

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:47.180
 many ball losses had the 

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:48.260
 not fit yourself and us 

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:50.990
 partly also the first fight 

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:52.780
 did not necessarily win and that 

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:54.770
 is much more decisive for me 

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:56.990
 then it was like this 

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:58.760
 decision is not done 

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:59.270
 a hello awake effect with us at my 

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:00.800
 team 

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:03.830
 we were a bit more handy then 

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:06.560
 then have us in the game at half-time 

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:09.100
 again repositioned by the 

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:11.780
 Substitutes of janosch weber again 

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:15.680
 offensive accent set what then yes 

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:17.390
 in the phase of the second half a 

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:21.560
 we did that for years 

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:23.000
 about the 1 1 scored and have 

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:24.710
 then the game actually in the grip and 

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.970
 then I will come back to one 

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:29.270
 We need to focus on our own nose 

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:31.850
 say grab hits as for 1 2 wo 

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:33.110
 we are too easy with what they are 

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:34.880
 not play three players out there 

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:36.040
 before the own sixteen later then 

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:38.450
 in his own sixteen 

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:42.260
 that's a godsend that 

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:43.540
 It must not happen then and we 

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:46.760
 need the opponent again 

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:48.890
 hectic into the game and then have at the 

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:52.160
 own offensive actions then also that 

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:53.450
 the necessary little luck there is not 

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:55.070
 then come back and then 

00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:57.980
 especially in this phase where we look for 

00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:59.510
 the last five minutes yet again 

00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:00.800
 We want to reposition ourselves 

00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:02.060
 put a peter schmitz forward with 

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:04.580
 long balls then operate 

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:05.870
 go back to 22 with the break rod 

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:07.190
 then go this fake shot 

00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:07.880
 into the angle in the top and then that's it 

00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:10.340
 run game 

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:11.780
 and as we said we have to today 

00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:12.470
 to grab your own nose we have it 

00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:16.430
 screwed up 

00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:18.290
 but that's just part of soccer 

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:20.000
 with the fact that you also defeats 

00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:22.610
 must be able to handle 

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.930
 and today we met as us but we 

00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:25.060
 have three days the next game and 

00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:30.290
 we have to shake it now 

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:31.490
 need to prepare well on wednesday 

00:07:30.290 --> 00:07:34.610
 Among other things the possibility of the thing 

00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:36.710
 back to start last short announcement of 

00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:38.390
 you thomas wegst what now that the 

00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:42.350
 teaming up again on wednesday and 

00:07:38.390 --> 00:07:43.910
 merge well again is good 

00:07:42.350 --> 00:07:44.780
 First of all, it's about that 

00:07:43.910 --> 00:07:46.760
 we are all in peace 

00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:48.320
 analyze this game today that me 

00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:49.970
 A horch must also be in the team 

00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:51.440
 also the opinion of the players are me 

00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:53.600
 then important in his analysis like this 

00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:55.550
 have seen this felt 

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:57.320
 it was located that we from the beginning 

00:07:55.550 --> 00:07:59.300
 were not so awake and not so ins 

00:07:57.320 --> 00:08:03.490
 have come as we are 

00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:05.930
 have presented and then have 

00:08:03.490 --> 00:08:06.740
 training and as we have said we have to 

00:08:05.930 --> 00:08:07.460
 back to the essentials 

00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:11.200
 focus 

00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:11.200
 thomas everything seemed clear please 

00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:13.980
 a
