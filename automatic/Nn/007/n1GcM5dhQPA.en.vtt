00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:09.070 
okay on this one and what an entry

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:12.180 
okay on this one and what an entry
they're<00:00:09.460> just<00:00:10.000> not<00:00:10.180> far<00:00:10.420> from<00:00:10.570> being<00:00:10.840> you<00:00:11.190> go

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:12.190 
they're just not far from being you go

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:13.890 
they're just not far from being you go
and<00:00:12.459> a<00:00:12.520> customer<00:00:13.000> has<00:00:13.119> asked<00:00:13.389> us<00:00:13.510> to<00:00:13.539> fit<00:00:13.869> a

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:13.900 
and a customer has asked us to fit a

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:18.420 
and a customer has asked us to fit a
constancy<00:00:14.830> in<00:00:14.920> our<00:00:15.039> water<00:00:16.680> okay<00:00:17.680> so<00:00:17.710> it's<00:00:18.340> a

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:18.430 
constancy in our water okay so it's a

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:19.920 
constancy in our water okay so it's a
thing<00:00:18.670> you<00:00:18.699> know<00:00:18.910> we<00:00:19.240> haven't<00:00:19.359> on<00:00:19.600> the<00:00:19.720> dollar

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:19.930 
thing you know we haven't on the dollar

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:22.220 
thing you know we haven't on the dollar
you<00:00:20.109> have<00:00:20.140> just<00:00:20.380> got<00:00:20.529> to<00:00:20.560> make<00:00:20.650> a<00:00:20.740> door<00:00:20.949> for<00:00:21.220> it

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
you have just got to make a door for it

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.509 
you have just got to make a door for it
and<00:00:23.230> you<00:00:23.619> know<00:00:23.710> it's<00:00:23.859> still<00:00:23.949> need<00:00:24.220> to<00:00:24.339> drop

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:24.519 
and you know it's still need to drop

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:26.569 
and you know it's still need to drop
down<00:00:24.759> so<00:00:24.999> just<00:00:25.269> like<00:00:25.480> any<00:00:25.660> other<00:00:25.839> love<00:00:26.080> love<00:00:26.320> it

00:00:26.569 --> 00:00:26.579 
down so just like any other love love it

00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:31.230 
down so just like any other love love it
put<00:00:27.579> there<00:00:27.789> and<00:00:27.939> is<00:00:28.060> fitted<00:00:28.269> in<00:00:28.539> place<00:00:29.880> so<00:00:30.880> the

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:31.240 
put there and is fitted in place so the

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:34.370 
put there and is fitted in place so the
reason<00:00:31.599> why<00:00:31.779> we<00:00:32.349> need<00:00:32.560> an<00:00:32.740> Constantina<00:00:33.579> ladder

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
reason why we need an Constantina ladder

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.750 
reason why we need an Constantina ladder
on<00:00:35.380> this<00:00:35.590> one<00:00:37.380> is<00:00:38.380> because<00:00:38.620> the<00:00:39.250> roof<00:00:39.550> space

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:39.760 
on this one is because the roof space

00:00:39.760 --> 00:01:09.090 
on this one is because the roof space
doesn't<00:00:40.390> allow<00:00:41.020> for<00:00:41.050> standard<00:01:07.950> we<00:01:08.950> have<00:01:09.070> a

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.100 
doesn't allow for standard we have a

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.700 
doesn't allow for standard we have a
spring<00:01:09.460> motion<00:01:10.030> which<00:01:10.359> helps<00:01:10.719> you<00:01:10.929> sort<00:01:11.499> of

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:11.710 
spring motion which helps you sort of

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:15.359 
spring motion which helps you sort of
like<00:01:11.969> tilt<00:01:12.969> it<00:01:13.240> back<00:01:13.450> ends<00:01:13.659> on<00:01:13.810> the<00:01:13.869> left<00:01:14.369> but

00:01:15.359 --> 00:01:15.369 
like tilt it back ends on the left but

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:16.980 
like tilt it back ends on the left but
the<00:01:15.490> beauty<00:01:15.820> of<00:01:15.850> these<00:01:15.999> lenses<00:01:16.450> as<00:01:16.570> now<00:01:16.719> as<00:01:16.869> you

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:16.990 
the beauty of these lenses as now as you

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:20.609 
the beauty of these lenses as now as you
can<00:01:17.109> see<00:01:17.820> there's<00:01:18.820> his<00:01:18.969> roof<00:01:19.210> right<00:01:20.200> support

00:01:20.609 --> 00:01:20.619 
can see there's his roof right support

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:23.069 
can see there's his roof right support
for<00:01:20.829> leather<00:01:21.119> so<00:01:22.119> this<00:01:22.390> was<00:01:22.569> a<00:01:22.600> standard

00:01:23.069 --> 00:01:23.079 
for leather so this was a standard

00:01:23.079 --> 00:01:26.190 
for leather so this was a standard
leather<00:01:24.030> it<00:01:25.030> would<00:01:25.149> basically<00:01:25.329> hit<00:01:25.869> the<00:01:26.020> roof

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:26.200 
leather it would basically hit the roof

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.179 
leather it would basically hit the roof
and<00:01:27.039> it<00:01:27.219> wouldn't<00:01:27.460> fold<00:01:27.700> in<00:01:28.710> so<00:01:29.710> this<00:01:29.859> is<00:01:30.009> where

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:30.189 
and it wouldn't fold in so this is where

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:33.959 
and it wouldn't fold in so this is where
the<00:01:30.249> constatine<00:01:30.759> a<00:01:30.909> lot<00:01:31.090> of<00:01:32.700> comments<00:01:33.700> are

00:01:33.959 --> 00:01:33.969 
the constatine a lot of comments are

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:36.660 
the constatine a lot of comments are
there<00:01:34.060> no<00:01:34.240> really<00:01:34.719> because<00:01:35.189> we<00:01:36.189> require

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:36.670 
there no really because we require

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:41.819 
there no really because we require
virtually<00:01:37.659> no<00:01:38.579> roof<00:01:39.579> space<00:01:39.789> above<00:01:40.149> I<00:01:40.479> mean<00:01:41.350> the

00:01:41.819 --> 00:01:41.829 
virtually no roof space above I mean the

00:01:41.829 --> 00:01:43.529 
virtually no roof space above I mean the
height<00:01:42.039> of<00:01:42.249> this<00:01:42.340> backboard<00:01:42.819> now<00:01:43.119> this<00:01:43.420> is

00:01:43.529 --> 00:01:43.539 
height of this backboard now this is

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:46.379 
height of this backboard now this is
fixed<00:01:43.899> to<00:01:44.049> is<00:01:44.619> the<00:01:44.950> only<00:01:45.340> height<00:01:45.609> it<00:01:46.119> needs

00:01:46.379 --> 00:01:46.389 
fixed to is the only height it needs

00:01:46.389 --> 00:01:52.010 
fixed to is the only height it needs
above<00:01:47.079> the<00:01:48.119> up<00:01:49.119> of<00:01:49.299> the<00:01:49.420> surface<00:01:49.869> of<00:01:49.959> the<00:01:50.020> loft

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
above the up of the surface of the loft

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:57.569 
above the up of the surface of the loft
so<00:01:53.020> as<00:01:53.170> you<00:01:53.350> can<00:01:53.499> see<00:01:54.060> there's<00:01:55.060> the<00:01:55.209> board<00:01:56.579> and

00:01:57.569 --> 00:01:57.579 
so as you can see there's the board and

00:01:57.579 --> 00:02:01.010 
so as you can see there's the board and
there's<00:01:57.819> the<00:01:57.939> loft<00:01:58.119> surface<00:01:58.859> so<00:01:59.859> what's<00:02:00.219> the

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
there's the loft surface so what's the

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.769 
there's the loft surface so what's the
500<00:02:02.020> millimeters<00:02:02.759> that's<00:02:03.759> all<00:02:03.999> requires<00:02:04.539> up

00:02:04.769 --> 00:02:04.779 
500 millimeters that's all requires up

00:02:04.779 --> 00:02:08.850 
500 millimeters that's all requires up
of<00:02:04.929> the<00:02:05.049> loft<00:02:05.229> space

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:08.860 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.140 

we'll<00:02:09.860> fold<00:02:10.160> it<00:02:10.369> up<00:02:10.460> now<00:02:10.670> and<00:02:10.850> see<00:02:11.000> what<00:02:11.060> it

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
we'll fold it up now and see what it

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:19.090 
we'll fold it up now and see what it
look<00:02:11.300> like<00:02:11.330> foldable<00:02:17.470> all<00:02:18.470> the<00:02:18.710> other<00:02:18.860> things

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100 
look like foldable all the other things

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:23.350 
look like foldable all the other things
do<00:02:19.340> to<00:02:19.460> cook<00:02:20.260> plus<00:02:21.260> points<00:02:21.650> with<00:02:21.890> these<00:02:22.150> is<00:02:23.150> the

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 
do to cook plus points with these is the

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.340 
do to cook plus points with these is the
flat<00:02:23.720> treads<00:02:24.280> and<00:02:25.570> as<00:02:26.570> you<00:02:26.720> see<00:02:26.900> the<00:02:27.020> tread

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:27.350 
flat treads and as you see the tread

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:32.860 
flat treads and as you see the tread
supply<00:02:28.300> also<00:02:29.300> quite<00:02:30.080> wide<00:02:31.300> quite<00:02:32.300> comfortable

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
supply also quite wide quite comfortable

feeling unlike some of the you know
these<00:02:42.790> bargain<00:02:43.790> ladders<00:02:44.180> we<00:02:44.420> do<00:02:44.570> the

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780 
these bargain ladders we do the

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:48.150 
these bargain ladders we do the
aluminium<00:02:44.960> ones<00:02:45.410> they've<00:02:45.710> got<00:02:45.860> round<00:02:46.160> threads

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.160 
aluminium ones they've got round threads

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:50.890 
aluminium ones they've got round threads
these<00:02:49.160> are<00:02:49.340> nice<00:02:49.520> and<00:02:49.550> flat<00:02:49.940> almost<00:02:50.660> a<00:02:50.780> bit

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
these are nice and flat almost a bit

00:02:50.900 --> 00:03:12.010 
these are nice and flat almost a bit
like<00:02:51.080> a<00:02:51.110> staircase<00:02:51.500> in<00:02:51.950> a<00:02:52.010> way<00:03:10.510> see<00:03:11.510> fit<00:03:11.690> as<00:03:11.780> far

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:12.020 
like a staircase in a way see fit as far

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:19.580 
like a staircase in a way see fit as far
as<00:03:12.140> you<00:03:12.260> can<00:03:12.500> no<00:03:12.680> we<00:03:12.830> by<00:03:13.040> hand

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.880 

now<00:03:20.100> all<00:03:20.280> of<00:03:20.459> these<00:03:20.640> are<00:03:20.910> Springs<00:03:21.420> and<00:03:22.380> which

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
now all of these are Springs and which

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:26.600 
now all of these are Springs and which
does<00:03:23.790> help<00:03:24.060> the<00:03:24.270> mechanism<00:03:24.780> you<00:03:25.650> still<00:03:26.040> do

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:26.610 
does help the mechanism you still do

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:32.870 
does help the mechanism you still do
require<00:03:27.090> a<00:03:28.280> set<00:03:29.280> amount<00:03:29.459> of<00:03:30.590> force<00:03:31.590> wet<00:03:32.520> so<00:03:32.850> you

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880
