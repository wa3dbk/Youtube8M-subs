it's<00:00:16.770> just<00:00:17.160> sheet<00:00:17.730> metal<00:00:18.060> basically<00:00:18.660> with<00:00:18.900> the

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
it's just sheet metal basically with the

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.160 
it's just sheet metal basically with the
self-tapping<00:00:19.710> screws<00:00:20.220> and<00:00:20.840> this<00:00:21.840> is<00:00:21.990> usually

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
self-tapping screws and this is usually

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.310 
self-tapping screws and this is usually
what<00:00:22.500> happens<00:00:22.529> is<00:00:23.100> this'll<00:00:23.820> break<00:00:24.060> or<00:00:24.510> when

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
what happens is this'll break or when

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.259 
what happens is this'll break or when
you<00:00:25.410> tighten<00:00:25.650> up<00:00:25.710> the<00:00:25.859> bolts<00:00:26.039> they're<00:00:26.970> just

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
you tighten up the bolts they're just

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.990 
you tighten up the bolts they're just
gonna<00:00:27.480> spin<00:00:27.810> freely<00:00:28.140> because<00:00:28.650> the<00:00:29.250> thin<00:00:29.490> metal

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
gonna spin freely because the thin metal

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.240 
gonna spin freely because the thin metal
here<00:00:30.449> is<00:00:30.710> basically<00:00:31.710> enlarged<00:00:33.590> so<00:00:34.590> we'll<00:00:35.010> fix

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
here is basically enlarged so we'll fix

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:35.660 
here is basically enlarged so we'll fix
that

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
drilling you're actually hitting part of

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.110 
drilling you're actually hitting part of
the<00:02:26.660> snowblower<00:02:27.020> body<00:02:27.440> underneath<00:02:28.120> because

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
the snowblower body underneath because

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.110 
the snowblower body underneath because
it<00:02:29.480> only<00:02:29.600> goes<00:02:29.870> about<00:02:30.140> this<00:02:30.440> far<00:02:30.910> so<00:02:31.910> you've
