it's a Knicks outta extension cable
inside<00:00:14.549> the<00:00:14.730> ps3<00:00:17.449> to<00:00:18.449> the<00:00:18.539> hard<00:00:18.720> drive<00:00:19.880> okay

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
inside the ps3 to the hard drive okay

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.710 
inside the ps3 to the hard drive okay
probably<00:00:21.420> wondering<00:00:21.779> why<00:00:21.930> I'm<00:00:22.020> doing<00:00:22.320> that<00:00:23.720> no

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.019 
probably wondering why I'm doing that no
okay<00:00:25.320> if<00:00:25.500> you<00:00:25.619> get<00:00:25.740> like<00:00:25.890> a<00:00:25.949> tera<00:00:26.279> 2<00:00:26.580> terabyte

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
okay if you get like a tera 2 terabyte

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.599 
okay if you get like a tera 2 terabyte
drive<00:00:27.330> it's<00:00:28.260> not<00:00:28.439> gonna<00:00:28.619> fit<00:00:28.859> in<00:00:28.890> the<00:00:29.070> ps3

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
drive it's not gonna fit in the ps3

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.500 
drive it's not gonna fit in the ps3
because<00:00:29.970> it'll<00:00:30.359> be<00:00:30.510> thicker<00:00:30.990> I<00:00:31.820> just<00:00:32.820> get<00:00:32.969> a

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
because it'll be thicker I just get a

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.459 
because it'll be thicker I just get a
external<00:00:34.410> case<00:00:34.680> modify<00:00:35.579> a<00:00:35.610> little<00:00:35.760> bit<00:00:36.320> we<00:00:37.320> get

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
external case modify a little bit we get

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.240 
external case modify a little bit we get
this<00:00:37.620> in<00:00:37.800> the<00:00:37.890> case<00:00:38.629> and<00:00:39.829> then<00:00:40.829> you<00:00:40.950> have<00:00:41.070> 2

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
this in the case and then you have 2

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.830 
this in the case and then you have 2
terabytes<00:00:41.670> of<00:00:41.790> storage<00:00:43.940> and<00:00:44.940> the<00:00:45.030> ps3<00:00:45.329> doesn't

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
terabytes of storage and the ps3 doesn't

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:51.560 
terabytes of storage and the ps3 doesn't
really<00:00:46.020> even<00:00:46.170> notice<00:00:46.649> the<00:00:46.770> difference<00:00:50.570> and

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
really even notice the difference and

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.689 
really even notice the difference and
plugged<00:00:51.809> in<00:00:52.190> inside<00:00:53.190> or<00:00:53.550> out

00:00:55.689 --> 00:00:55.699
