00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.410
 then we are recording hello rices 

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:11.450
 wait I have to look you in the face 

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:22.050
 then list a year at risk 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:25.289
 of charity cut anyway you hear back 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.849
 I'm doing an intro that you do it 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:30.480
 you know I like doing things 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:33.960
 very particular however this within a 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:36.450
 really extraordinary intro because it is 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.730
 just that the pact that particular then 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:42.829
 don't worry sweet and sensitive 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:46.530
 as if you did not even describe me 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:49.649
 practically in your message that seeds 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.739
 and honey made to dry to a tooth 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:54.780
 on the axis to see this message 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:59.250
 so I'm practically doing you a 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:03.300
 intro but I think it will really take 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:07.640
 some time simply because you 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.640
 you know I also do my videos 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:12.850
 these days I have to fight in a 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:15.910
 horror video here in my house so it is 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:18.250
 very quite challenging then 

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:21.160
 imagine gna tele from all sides e 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:23.260
 companions at sea and then I have to do more 

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:26.650
 also my makeup where to do the 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:29.770
 tutorial and even some recipe from 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:33.190
 you get that for the halloween channel 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:36.430
 so this period will always continue 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:39.010
 to make this video too though 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:41.800
 tomorrow I pretend I will continue almost all 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:46.320
 the day he will really work for 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:46.320
 a lot then I want to tell you the secrets 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:51.360
 so now we do not see esp after and 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:58.360
 then this program that you see yes 

00:01:55.899 --> 00:02:01.720
 called cinema palace of is a program 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:05.950
 of animation you see all these things 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:07.890
 I do n't know see everything all this 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:12.940
 things here have been pretty much 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:14.890
 just insert this side 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:17.950
 program I have now for per 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:22.330
 register this part 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:25.840
 then this one then to a program 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:30.190
 of animation of I had thought of thallus 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:32.430
 compose 7 but I do with cinema 4d 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:36.420
 then I will explain to you how the intro will be 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.420
 start from here 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:44.980
 wait not known or not 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:47.320
 you will understand it won do not worry 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:51.010
 then why do you imagine that it is the 

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:53.079
 camera that the image is the 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:55.120
 camera then us from here 

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:59.350
 we will move then I will move between the 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:07.209
 objects but love we'll get to the other 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:09.910
 head of the street ok it goes by a whole 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:12.190
 road then perfect made in the way 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:15.910
 perfect look what a beautiful way 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:19.970
 so I will logically take all of them 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:24.080
 the details send everything has done 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:25.760
 Bedroom seen from the two and a half hours from 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:27.740
 two and a half in the afternoon to do it but 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:31.220
 now at this time logically not 

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:31.640
 I can do more and then I have to go out not 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:33.140
 here we go 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:35.390
 we have to go to the restaurant to eat 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:37.460
 so I stop because then logically 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:41.960
 so I can't do it anymore 

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:46.160
 imagine that in this space there is 

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:49.940
 a huge beautiful building created by 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:54.860
 me always with this gallery program 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:57.709
 where is written riri gallery you enter e 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:04:00.260
 there are these corridors where there are i 

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:02.750
 whose jewels on display I got myself 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:05.360
 all photographs and there are whose 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:08.060
 jewels displayed as if they were gods 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:10.220
 paintings with classical music but you 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:12.920
 imagine that even at the spatial ai 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:17.600
 space for so many people looking for 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:20.600
 this is what we say in this 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:23.480
 in this gallery then you go along 

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:25.940
 this corridor while you see i 

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:28.040
 worry so we move with the 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:32.660
 camera here and when we do 

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:35.330
 see the two jewels you enter in this 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:39.830
 automatic door where written above 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:42.830
 ridley tutorial and then you enter in 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:45.919
 this room and you imagine as if 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:48.919
 he was a great man in the theater where he is 

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:50.870
 written in all parts in gold and with 

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:53.540
 two jewels crisis 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:56.750
 suddenly a door opens e 

00:04:53.540 --> 00:05:00.650
 behind there was green screen where 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:02.800
 then you come in with your tutorial 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:07.160
 I believe in everything done with music 

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:10.340
 classic sweet is really beautiful 

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:12.680
 an idea of ​​I had extraordinary hope 

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:15.470
 which you will like then though 

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:17.960
 what you need just to be patient 

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:20.419
 a little simply because then in the end 

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:21.440
 care accounts and your passion but me 

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:24.470
 it's me too 

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:26.270
 so automatically me too 

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:29.750
 like to make my videos 

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:34.970
 so I believe that this intro that you 

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:36.860
 I'm doing maybe it may seem like a 

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:39.620
 a little ridiculous, so I guess this 

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:42.710
 big building behind you no behind 

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:45.860
 these trees imagine this beautiful 

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:48.800
 palace then here for the whole covered 

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:51.650
 of people things so I guess this 

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:54.020
 beautiful building with all with columns 

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:56.750
 of granite that does that to symbolize 

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:58.970
 just the power of rice that is I want 

00:05:56.750 --> 00:06:02.660
 do something that symbolizes 

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:06.380
 just the power of your credit 

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:09.289
 connect last so i think it is 

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:13.759
 really a very nice thing that i am 

00:06:09.289 --> 00:06:15.880
 creating I said mo are seven o'clock 

00:06:13.759 --> 00:06:18.710
 a quarter to 

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:23.570
 voila so it's seven o'clock 

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:27.020
 fourth and in Salento from yours 22 10 2 

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:31.360
 a fact this is so i'm doing 

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:34.039
 really a beautiful thing i hope 

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:36.139
 that you will surely like it 

00:06:34.039 --> 00:06:38.000
 because as I intro do a thing of the 

00:06:36.139 --> 00:06:40.070
 kind of sure he's not doing it to you 

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.830
 no limit can the script do 

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:47.040
 that make the balls they promote 

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:48.340
 then accompany hi rigby e 

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:51.790
 and nothing 

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:54.690
 so don't be envious of make-up 

00:06:51.790 --> 00:07:01.830
 that seemed monster I recommend 

00:06:54.690 --> 00:07:01.830
 hello hello hello hello hello have patience
