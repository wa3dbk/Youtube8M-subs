00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:35.910
 comfortable is the astor skin match between 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.800

 summer just totally super has a spf 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.320

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.660

 I can recommend product very much 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:04.030
 if you want to know more about it 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:07.340
 then you look at the review 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:10.010
 That would be product number one product 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.360
 x 2 which I totally super finder and also 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:14.870

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:17.060
 maybelline pitney concealer yes i have 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:19.250
 The colors 15 is the brightest I am 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.840
 really great the dect super off 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:23.060
 and you do not get into it like that either 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.979
 pure and yes I can totally 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.140
 recommend until now not the 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:30.680
 most expensive concealer i believe 6 euro 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:32.890
 or so and also gets very very great 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:32.890
 product 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.549
 then it goes on with face against 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:41.710
 I searched and found a browser 

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:43.450
 although by albert but also ever 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:46.030
 My favorite was that of this one 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:47.890
 baked duo bronze I find him 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:49.500
 really great so that you can 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:52.210
 do not brake 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.850
 you can see it looks very natural 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:55.720
 and also for bright today like me 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:59.409
 super suitable 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:01.540
 i have the color 20 sunny brawns and 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:03.729
 yes it has such a bad blog 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:07.000
 I'm also directly involved with it most of the time 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:10.060
 both colors and then it really comes 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:13.300
 a super super nice color out and 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:15.600
 quite discreet and great product 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.600
 Super cheap 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:24.780
 then two songs have chosen the 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:27.000

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:45.629
 The eyelet fold is perfect 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:48.299

 copy and jacky terry great things 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:36.919
 and yes not so attacks from 5 euros 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:39.610
 or 6 euros per pen and that's worth it 

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:39.610
 definitely 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:51.150
 products on 7 is this mail berlin 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:52.890
 brown drama in medium brown 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:55.500
 I think that's really good 

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:58.380
 that fixes the eyebrows very nicely 

00:04:55.500 --> 00:05:01.500
 and gives the once such a person 

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:02.670
 tecan color and just defines it 

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:04.770
 a bit so who does not 

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:06.330
 Eye contact or similar 

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:08.520
 want to use but only so completely 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:09.930
 discreetly the eyebrows want to emphasize that 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:13.260
 Can i really recommend this 

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:14.790
 Great product and eyebrows 

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:17.420
 Stay where you are all day 

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:17.420
 belong 

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:24.050
 then come in the last three 

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:26.360
 products which my care products 

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:28.490
 are not selected first of all 

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:30.950
 the reval of the loop eye make up 

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:32.720
 Remover is for me a holy grail 

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:36.820
 I've been using it for years 

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:38.990
 since I do not know 16 

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:40.730
 yes I have just in between 

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:42.440
 try but nobody comes for me 

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:44.330
 at this here I always buy myself 

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:47.620
 again after and for me that is the 

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:47.620
 World's Best Eyes Make Up Remover 

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:53.669
 then it continues with an eye 

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:55.770
 cream I buy something for me 

00:05:53.669 --> 00:05:58.889
 reports that soon is empty and indeed 

00:05:55.770 --> 00:06:02.699
 from la vera the intensive eye care with 

00:05:58.889 --> 00:06:04.620
 white tea and carina oil which is so great 

00:06:02.699 --> 00:06:07.620
 You can also in the evening during the day 

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:10.620
 great uses great one donates super 

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:11.790
 Moisture and drought 

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:13.770
 wrinkles disappear 

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:16.139

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:17.550
 I can do that absolutely 

00:06:16.139 --> 00:06:18.930
 The best I recommend is someone 

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:19.650
 unbelievably the first one I have after 

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:22.550
 buy 

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:22.550
 really great 

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:29.400
 and the first product I give you 

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:33.120
 want to show is from weleda that mandl 

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:34.919
 facial soothing facial image it is 

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:36.600
 pure almond oil and I give myself that 

00:06:34.919 --> 00:06:38.940
 then in the evening I knock me so on 

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:41.280
 the skin and the next morning you 

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:44.150

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:47.940
 moistened and you feel 

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:50.580
 fresh super and that too would have 

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:51.930
 not at all, so I'm super 

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:54.870

00:06:58.979 --> 00:07:03.300
 every second evening I use that and 

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:05.550
 best to have a bit of the skin 

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:07.680
 moist then give that into your hands and 

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:09.419
 knock on the face so easily and on the 

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:11.810
 next morning you feel like new 

00:07:09.419 --> 00:07:11.810
