00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:30.679 
by folding this in half into a triangle
shape<00:00:27.619> okay<00:00:28.619> now<00:00:29.519> we're<00:00:30.119> going<00:00:30.210> to<00:00:30.269> take<00:00:30.510> the

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
shape okay now we're going to take the

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.590 
shape okay now we're going to take the
triangle<00:00:31.320> and<00:00:31.439> open<00:00:31.949> it<00:00:32.070> back<00:00:32.219> up<00:00:32.279> and<00:00:32.759> we're

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
triangle and open it back up and we're

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.530 
triangle and open it back up and we're
going<00:00:33.690> to<00:00:33.780> use<00:00:34.020> this<00:00:34.230> center<00:00:34.649> line<00:00:34.860> as<00:00:35.219> a<00:00:35.280> guide

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:35.540 
going to use this center line as a guide

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:38.030 
going to use this center line as a guide
we're<00:00:36.540> going<00:00:36.660> to<00:00:36.719> take<00:00:36.960> this<00:00:37.230> corner<00:00:37.710> and<00:00:37.829> fold

we're going to take this corner and fold
it<00:00:38.940> down<00:00:39.300> to<00:00:39.629> the<00:00:39.719> center<00:00:39.960> line<00:00:40.320> like<00:00:40.559> this<00:00:41.719> and

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
it down to the center line like this and

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.950 
it down to the center line like this and
do<00:00:43.440> the<00:00:43.559> same<00:00:43.829> thing<00:00:44.160> on<00:00:44.399> the<00:00:44.789> other<00:00:44.820> side<00:00:45.059> does

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
do the same thing on the other side does

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:51.170 
do the same thing on the other side does
not<00:00:46.200> have<00:00:46.469> to<00:00:46.620> be<00:00:46.739> super<00:00:47.100> precise<00:00:49.129> okay<00:00:50.129> so<00:00:51.090> you

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
not have to be super precise okay so you

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:52.369

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
over now you see you have sort of a cone

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.959 
over now you see you have sort of a cone
shape<00:00:57.840> we're<00:00:58.739> going<00:00:58.859> to<00:00:58.920> make<00:00:59.039> the<00:00:59.190> front<00:00:59.430> knot

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
shape we're going to make the front knot

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.740 
shape we're going to make the front knot
of<00:01:00.329> the<00:01:00.359> necktie<00:01:00.960> fold<00:01:01.949> it<00:01:02.129> down<00:01:02.480> fold<00:01:03.480> it<00:01:03.570> down

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
about 1/3 of the way like that go ahead

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.670 
about 1/3 of the way like that go ahead
and<00:01:08.430> get<00:01:08.520> that<00:01:08.549> a<00:01:08.729> crease<00:01:09.260> I'm<00:01:10.260> going<00:01:10.470> to<00:01:10.530> take

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
and get that a crease I'm going to take

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.170 
and get that a crease I'm going to take
the<00:01:10.830> point<00:01:11.130> and<00:01:11.460> I'm<00:01:11.610> going<00:01:11.760> to<00:01:11.820> fold<00:01:12.000> the

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
the point and I'm going to fold the

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.410 
the point and I'm going to fold the
point<00:01:12.540> up<00:01:13.070> not<00:01:14.070> all<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:14.580> way<00:01:14.700> back<00:01:14.909> to<00:01:15.090> the<00:01:15.210> top

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
point up not all the way back to the top

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.109 
point up not all the way back to the top
but<00:01:15.630> part<00:01:16.020> of<00:01:16.140> the<00:01:16.290> way<00:01:16.470> so<00:01:17.400> you<00:01:17.460> end<00:01:17.759> up<00:01:17.880> with<00:01:18.090> a

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
but part of the way so you end up with a

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:22.039 
but part of the way so you end up with a
little<00:01:18.890> squiggly<00:01:19.890> business<00:01:20.400> like<00:01:20.850> that<00:01:21.049> okay

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
little squiggly business like that okay

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:25.490 
little squiggly business like that okay
and<00:01:22.710> now<00:01:23.390> see<00:01:24.390> here<00:01:24.659> where<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:24.930> point<00:01:25.259> meets

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
and now see here where the point meets

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.069 
and now see here where the point meets
the<00:01:25.830> edge<00:01:26.040> we're<00:01:26.850> going<00:01:26.880> to<00:01:27.000> fold<00:01:27.240> that<00:01:27.450> again

00:01:30.069 --> 00:01:30.079 

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:32.690 

so<00:01:31.079> that<00:01:31.290> we<00:01:31.409> end<00:01:31.650> up<00:01:31.860> with<00:01:31.920> something<00:01:32.549> that

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
so that we end up with something that

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.270 
so that we end up with something that
looks<00:01:32.729> like<00:01:33.060> this<00:01:34.070> okay

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
looks like this okay

looks like this okay
now<00:01:35.369> we're<00:01:35.490> going<00:01:35.579> to<00:01:35.670> turn<00:01:35.820> it<00:01:35.970> over<00:01:36.090> again

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:36.439 
now we're going to turn it over again

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:38.510 
now we're going to turn it over again
and<00:01:37.439> we're<00:01:37.590> going<00:01:37.710> to<00:01:37.770> do<00:01:37.890> the<00:01:38.009> same<00:01:38.220> thing

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
and we're going to do the same thing

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.550 
and we're going to do the same thing
with<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:38.820> back<00:01:38.939> flaps<00:01:39.329> that<00:01:39.570> we<00:01:39.630> did<00:01:39.960> before

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
with the back flaps that we did before

fold<00:01:44.100> them<00:01:44.369> in<00:01:44.579> again<00:01:44.880> like<00:01:45.630> this<00:01:47.540> so<00:01:48.540> that

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
fold them in again like this so that

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.600 
fold them in again like this so that
they<00:01:48.930> come<00:01:49.229> in<00:01:49.439> and<00:01:49.680> meet<00:01:50.189> the<00:01:50.220> center<00:01:50.670> line

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:52.610 
they come in and meet the center line

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:55.219 
they come in and meet the center line
there<00:01:53.610> you<00:01:53.759> go<00:01:54.020> voila

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229
