00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
recapping to a large extent the method

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.439 
recapping to a large extent the method
of<00:00:19.830> adjusting<00:00:20.340> the<00:00:20.369> gears<00:00:20.699> it<00:00:20.880> is<00:00:20.970> exactly

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
point to remember is that for all of

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.400 
point to remember is that for all of
your<00:00:50.730> adjustments<00:00:51.360> you<00:00:51.480> should<00:00:51.660> start<00:00:52.079> in<00:00:52.320> the

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
your adjustments you should start in the

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.950 
your adjustments you should start in the
highest<00:00:52.829> gear<00:00:53.129> that<00:00:53.879> is<00:00:53.910> to<00:00:54.239> say<00:00:54.449> the<00:00:54.660> chain

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
highest gear that is to say the chain

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.869 
highest gear that is to say the chain
should<00:00:54.989> be<00:00:55.320> in<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:55.649> smallest<00:00:56.010> sprocket<00:00:56.460> on

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
should be in the smallest sprocket on
