00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.330
 precious the beginning is so for this 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:08.460
 video my project the dehydrator so 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.730
 here I thought well and I'm going 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:16.260
 crack for the sedona model so I 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:18.240
 show you photos so links 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.869
 this is really like a mini 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:24.449
 they black oven with nine trays and 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:27.779
 he has several peculiarities compared 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:30.330
 to other machines of this type there it is 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.730
 that we can make it work that the 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.380
 part of the top or the bottom part 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.390
 seen that he has two engines actually to 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.450
 the back that allows precisely 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.280
 split into two devices it's really 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.160
 great when we have two types 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.870
 feeding that cook on two 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.309
 different schedules or two different 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.820
 cooking we can really do it in 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:53.100
 same time so it's very interesting 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:56.190
 although at first I will use it 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.410
 especially to dehydrate fruits and 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.329
 first rabbit vegetables after I think 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.890
 in my to serve also for me and 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:05.100
 that's why I spent 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:09.409
 command on amazon so I waited for 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.409
 receive this video 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:16.729
 so here are three leagues on the 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:21.060
 dehydrator so recipes to make 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:22.680
 thanks to his dehydrator so week 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.210
 recipes that can also be done in the oven 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.530
 melo tip dufour or those who do not 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.780
 not keep the nutrients the 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:31.020
 vitamins foods while the cdh 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:33.689
 ona this capacity low leather here 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.110
 temperature and thus keep all 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:38.710
 vitamins 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:40.090
 semou animals so that's because 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:42.250
 I put it going super how 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:44.170
 I will have three months of conservation 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:48.100
 my carrots is not drying me so I 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:50.500
 could give them some while 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:53.050
 the season is going to be hot 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:55.630
 no, but it's going to go wrong I can not wait and 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:59.260
 I also decided to change their 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:01.150
 feeding by suppressing the cries nor 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:04.660
 complete then I will draw myself the 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:06.280
 everyone's lightnings and I know myself 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:09.250
 that's the amount I'm giving them 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:11.380
 give I do not see what it can 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.880
 bring if I give them here are elected 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:16.180
 vegetables and fruits 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:17.230
 instead a healthier situation more 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:21.010
 natural 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:23.260
 there are already some who do it so I think 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:25.180
 really delete by the end of 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:28.060
 next year I have them go 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:30.010
 gently but remove punishes 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:33.600
 complete because already it's expensive and 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:36.190
 then it's something chemical 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:39.850
 we do not understand everything in it 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:45.850
 so I got caught but that's 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:47.290
 mordicus I suppress that yeah egea 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:49.570
 to go and redo fruit 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:51.489
 homemade dried vegetables because I 'll be 

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:54.900
 that above there are no preservatives 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:57.340
 there are no standing enhancers at 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.900
 of stuff that caught this time 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:01.600
 finally stuff that chemical disgusting 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:04.239
 as possible that are useless for 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:05.980
 a rabbit and even for me I mean 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:08.140
 it will be great to be able to do that as 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:10.269
 a potting soil when I get to the world at 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:13.000
 place of the traditional chips full of 

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:14.860
 salt and fat and by that I will make them 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.820
 discover that we can eat weights 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:21.400
 carrot apples even melon 

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:23.860
 dehydrated are full of lots of things 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:29.709
 that I can make eggplants and 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:31.600
 where will it be great because the pass and 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:34.079
 my hope sea ​​which I ask 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:36.730
 no one to follow me in this delusion there 

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:40.690
 here I present you is quickly done 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:44.100
 but other purchases we all have to you 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:44.100

 so that's why we got this and smos 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:57.210
 winter saw they associate by employment 

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:59.820
 who yes when you see here the salad 

00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:01.740
 the flat parsley and the monte so that's it 

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:03.780
 pods combine fruits and 

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:06.120
 vegetables not necessarily worms because me 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:09.900
 I've shared a flat with 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:12.530
 banana carrot with apple and apple barns 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:15.810
 lemon and it was just but super good 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:17.580
 I do not know this mixer here is jelly 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:20.489
 purpose and it was great 

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:23.430
 and if I felt but richly strong 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:25.320
 areas case I keep changing my 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:27.900
 attention like that removes everything that 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:28.820
 is industrial oc 2 na vi and my 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:31.800
 food 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:35.940
 but the small party still not too much 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:38.180
 what is a good chocolate is 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:40.080
 then these little little books 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:41.550
 I was really surprised by the head 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:43.470
 I did not care when I was 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:45.470
 young this level is so your tips from 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:49.140
 movies and at the mill 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:51.090
 in fact it's a little guide then the 

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:53.220
 bebah plankton man rabbits this is the 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:55.290
 title that interested me a lot but in 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:55.860
 done I should have read better chance the 

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:58.500
 description 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:00.060
 because it's not a book with everyone 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:03.660
 all the plants that can be given 

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:07.680
 to his rabbit there is but opposite it is 

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:09.240
 more recipes to make to have 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:11.250
 natural products from products to 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:13.140
 plants will clean his rabbit so 

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:18.450
 we have a product for the eyes to drown 

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:20.250
 the ears the nose to help the five 

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:23.070
 we make them a transit stop and its 

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:26.070
 restart the transit for stress 

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:29.790
 so for calm and relax so 

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:32.340
 here and in more it specifies that this 

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:33.360
 is in no way a guide that can 

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:35.730
 prevent you from going to the 

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:39.630
 veterinary it is important to the world 

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:41.340
 symptom at the slightest strange behavior 

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:44.540
 of your rabbit to take him to the 

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:44.540
 veterinary because he alone 

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:48.950
 studies that need the drugs 

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:52.460
 do not hesitate data 

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:54.080
 chemical drugs to your rabbit 

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:55.940
 I will continue to go to 

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:57.980
 veterinarian despite the change 

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:59.900
 feeding is really trying 

00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:00.430
 to be more natural with my 

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:02.690
 rabbits 

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:06.170
 that's why you do not see 

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:07.820
 videos where I go when I wear them or 

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:10.040

00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:15.169
 I already have a second channel so at 

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:16.820
