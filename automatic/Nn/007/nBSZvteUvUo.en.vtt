I'm<00:01:21.950> surprised<00:01:22.340> that<00:01:22.520> that's<00:01:22.850> how<00:01:22.939> they

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:23.060 
I'm surprised that that's how they

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:24.429 
I'm surprised that that's how they
decided<00:01:23.420> that<00:01:23.450> mangle<00:01:23.990> should<00:01:24.140> technically

00:01:24.429 --> 00:01:24.439 
decided that mangle should technically

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:26.230 
decided that mangle should technically
roll<00:01:24.710> on<00:01:24.920> and<00:01:25.130> scars<00:01:25.399> just<00:01:25.640> get<00:01:25.729> the<00:01:25.820> me<00:01:25.969> yeah

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:26.240 
roll on and scars just get the me yeah

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:27.639 
roll on and scars just get the me yeah
but<00:01:26.479> I<00:01:26.509> think<00:01:26.689> mango<00:01:26.810> probably<00:01:27.259> didn't<00:01:27.500> trust

00:01:27.639 --> 00:01:27.649 
but I think mango probably didn't trust

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:30.639 
but I think mango probably didn't trust
it<00:01:27.829> based<00:01:28.700> on<00:01:28.850> the<00:01:28.969> waist<00:01:29.119> car<00:01:29.299> was<00:01:29.450> moving<00:01:29.649> so

00:01:30.639 --> 00:01:30.649 
it based on the waist car was moving so

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:33.569 
it based on the waist car was moving so
he<00:01:30.890> got<00:01:31.429> normally<00:01:31.820> tried<00:01:32.030> to<00:01:32.119> cover<00:01:32.360> himself

00:01:33.569 --> 00:01:33.579 
he got normally tried to cover himself

00:01:33.579 --> 00:01:35.620 
he got normally tried to cover himself
now<00:01:34.579> that's<00:01:34.880> the<00:01:34.909> kind<00:01:35.060> of<00:01:35.149> trust<00:01:35.420> that<00:01:35.479> you

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630 
now that's the kind of trust that you

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:37.510 
now that's the kind of trust that you
really<00:01:35.869> need<00:01:36.079> no<00:01:36.829> matter<00:01:37.009> what<00:01:37.189> your<00:01:37.369> school

kill basically off a wall jump tech yeah
on<00:02:43.280> the<00:02:43.489> B<00:02:43.760> and<00:02:44.150> instead<00:02:44.450> he<00:02:44.510> got<00:02:44.630> shot<00:02:44.870> now

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
on the B and instead he got shot now

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
made the game even yeah so I think that

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:52.030 
made the game even yeah so I think that
doesn't<00:02:51.200> major<00:02:51.350> thing<00:02:51.560> going<00:02:51.769> after<00:02:51.950> these

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 
doesn't major thing going after these

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:53.140 
doesn't major thing going after these
interesting<00:02:52.489> it<00:02:52.609> doesn't<00:02:52.790> get<00:02:52.850> mango

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
interesting it doesn't get mango

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.120 
interesting it doesn't get mango
platforms<00:02:53.690> so<00:02:54.139> it's<00:02:54.290> easier<00:02:54.620> to<00:02:54.829> be<00:02:54.980> one

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.130 
platforms so it's easier to be one

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:57.069 
platforms so it's easier to be one
people<00:02:55.519> on<00:02:55.609> a<00:02:55.700> fusion<00:02:56.150> yeah<00:02:56.660> I<00:02:56.690> think<00:02:56.840> that

00:02:57.069 --> 00:02:57.079
