have<00:00:43.559> to<00:00:43.680> do<00:00:43.920> is<00:00:45.680> showing<00:00:46.680> you<00:00:46.829> my<00:00:46.980> laptop<00:00:48.890> yeah

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
have to do is showing you my laptop yeah

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:55.580 
have to do is showing you my laptop yeah
first<00:00:50.670> you<00:00:51.410> you<00:00:52.410> need<00:00:52.620> an<00:00:52.739> mp3<00:00:53.129> file<00:00:53.600> and<00:00:54.600> you

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
first you you need an mp3 file and you

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.319 
first you you need an mp3 file and you
and<00:00:55.860> it<00:00:56.070> needs<00:00:56.309> to<00:00:56.489> be<00:00:56.610> at<00:00:56.699> the<00:00:56.730> top<00:00:57.000> of<00:00:57.180> the

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
and it needs to be at the top of the

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:04.609 
and it needs to be at the top of the
list<00:00:57.480> so<00:00:57.719> I<00:00:57.960> added<00:00:58.350> an<00:00:58.500> number<00:00:59.489> and<00:01:03.470> put<00:01:04.470> the

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
list so I added an number and put the

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:05.329 
list so I added an number and put the
flag<00:01:04.860> files

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
flag files

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.539 
flag files
FLAC<00:01:06.030> files<00:01:06.299> below<00:01:06.689> it<00:01:07.130> so<00:01:08.130> that<00:01:08.280> when<00:01:08.460> you

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
FLAC files below it so that when you

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.969 
FLAC files below it so that when you
sort<00:01:08.880> it<00:01:08.970> by<00:01:09.180> name<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:09.960> mp3<00:01:10.409> file<00:01:10.619> should<00:01:10.860> be

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
sort it by name the mp3 file should be

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.420 
sort it by name the mp3 file should be
at<00:01:11.100> the<00:01:11.220> top<00:01:11.430> so<00:01:11.869> because<00:01:12.869> it<00:01:13.049> has<00:01:13.229> it's<00:01:14.130> an

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
numerical it has a numerical value it's

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.030 
numerical it has a numerical value it's

so it plays the flat file now it doesn't

00:03:44.939 --> 00:03:46.729 
so it plays the flat file now it doesn't
list<00:03:45.299> the<00:03:45.389> flat<00:03:45.689> files<00:03:45.930> basically<00:03:46.200> but<00:03:46.560> it
