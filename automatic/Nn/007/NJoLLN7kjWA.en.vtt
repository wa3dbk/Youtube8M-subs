00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:18.760
 my name is earl I assume eri malacara 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:18.760
 founder of air and javier subires 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:25.210
 Y 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:28.470
 i 

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:33.850
 one of the most common questions that 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:35.740
 you make me my friends is that is the 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:39.220
 most difficult part of flying aircraft 

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:41.880
 twin-engine and also that is the most 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:44.739
 dangerous I came across this video 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:47.500
 sadly tragic and sad but 

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:51.000
 real on youtube and I want to use it for 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:51.000
 explain these two questions 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:54.350
 what my friends here in this video 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:56.570
 we are going to have the opportunity to see this 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:58.520
 plane that goes from left to right and 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:01.400
 approximately here is where it goes to 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:04.309
 start losing the left machine 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:05.449
 probably due to lack of 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:07.369
 gas 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:08.840
 it's hard to hear it in the video but it 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:10.640
 they already hear detonations where you are 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.320
 putting the left machine first thing 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.820
 what is going to happen is the bad to the 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.130
 left is going to pull to the left and 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:17.869
 is going to go down and the right wing with the 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:21.770
 good engine is going to make the plane 

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:24.470
 between inverted and in an auger 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:27.860
 impossible to recover at that height 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:31.039
 because of how low each one is 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:33.710
 fatal consequences let's see a 

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:35.810
 more time here and this is typical this is the 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:40.430
 typical accident of the motor aircraft 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:43.250
 where the wing on the left machine that 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:45.590
 the critical machine begins to lose 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:47.390
 power the first thing he does is lose 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:49.729
 support on the wing is lowered 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:53.060
 down the good wing the machine 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:55.280
 good starts to pull too much to the side 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:56.130
 left of the plane entering a 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:00.149
 auger 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:01.740
 inverted impossible to recover and this 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:04.079
 is what happens when the machine 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.689
 criticism goes away or it turns us off in this 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:08.729
 case the left side first thing 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:11.009
 what's going to happen is the machine is going to 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.290
 stop producing the normal piece that 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:16.319
 it produces when it is producing power 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:19.349
 and it's going to cause a lot drag much drag 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:20.980
 is going to have the tendency to pull 

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:23.890
 left side 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:25.629
 and the machine on the right side which is the 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:27.760
 which has power in this case in the 

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:30.459
 accident that we're going we were seeing 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.860
 that's what happened has too much 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:34.680
 rosso 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:37.710
 and makes it more pronounced milestone 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:40.650
 to the left side of the plane that's what 

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:43.980
 we have here if this machine goes off 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:45.750
 that the critical machine we have drive in 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.180
 this address because it is no longer 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:50.780
 producing power and in this machine 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:54.050
 we have rost 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:56.270
 what makes it more in fact the 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:03:00.440
 milestone in the video they realize it's towards 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:02.780
 here to the left is the trend 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:04.580
 natural that the plane has when it loses 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:06.290
 the machine left to the machine 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:08.360
 criticism I'm not going to get much into the 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:10.550
 twin-engine aerodynamics because it's not going to 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:12.140
 take several hours in fact but 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:14.930
 basically that's what happens this 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:17.510
 left machine loses rose causes more 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:19.160
 drag plus drive makes it go to the 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:21.580
 left this machine on the right side 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:24.739
 produces more shows than the good machine 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:27.650
 so go away pronounce yourself even more 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:30.140
 to the left that only what we know 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:33.019
 as the I have and the only way to 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:34.880
 stop it is applying more router with the 

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:37.880
 right pedal but if you do not have 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:39.530
 enough air in the router you're not going to 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:41.480
 have enough control of the plane in what 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:43.519
 that we call good if we can not 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:45.769
 get off that speed 

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:48.410
 we are having enough air in the 

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:50.600
 router to compensate for the milestone that 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:53.000
 the plane is going to give the left side the 

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:55.610
 another number that happens is seeing it from 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.620
 in front of the plane the machine that is going away 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:04:00.470
 to go is the left side machine 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:03.680
 instead of producing leaf the 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:07.040
 lifting as it just goes off the 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:09.769
 machine will now produce drag 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:11.840
 downwards lack of lifting and the 

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:14.420
 right machine that is the good one going to 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:18.950
 keep producing a live which is going to 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:22.640
 cause the movement to aggravate 

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:24.270
 of rotation that's why the plane does this and 

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:26.940
 do this 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:28.349
 only of the tendency to defeat 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:31.169
 you see in the video as the plane 

00:04:28.349 --> 00:04:33.419
 start doing this bow to the 

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:37.949
 left pulling to the left 

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:39.870
 followed by this and then the plane enters 

00:04:37.949 --> 00:04:42.930
 inverted which is impossible 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:44.419
 recover at that height there is no 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:48.599
 substitute for training 

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:51.070
 constant and practical on airplanes 

00:04:48.599 --> 00:04:52.570
 twin engine 

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:54.580
 Well there my friends have it 

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:57.100
 unfortunately a very sad case 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:59.020
 because I end up in fatalities but 

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:01.270
 also at the same time a very case 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:03.340
 realistic because this is one of the 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:05.650
 most common accidents that happen with 

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:07.210
 twin-engine aircraft when you do not have the 

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:10.180
 Preparation and proper training 

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:12.850
 for this and I wanted to present the 

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:14.320
 here in this video with the intention of 

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:16.650
 answer the two questions that make me 

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:18.940
 you more common and at the same time 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:20.890
 try to help them understand what 

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:23.470
 happens in this accident and apply it to 

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:25.570
 our life as pilots and with that 

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:27.640
 intention I am developing my store 

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:30.340
 online where you are going to be able to get 

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:32.410
 buy and download videos to follow 

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:34.930
 training and maintaining efficiency 

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:36.760
 as professional pilots this store 

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:39.460
 is in development and they are going to you 

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:42.130
 can find in shop here is below 

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:47.230
 on the screen sh 

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:49.570
 show point was aviation videos dot com 

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:51.730
 It's the page that I'm dedicating 

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:54.220
 exclusively to develop that type 

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:56.860
 materials put them up for sale and power 

00:05:54.220 --> 00:06:05.020
 well help you all 

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:06.460
 I have my website www vida23 extra that 

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:08.620
 can inform you about the 

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:10.590
 different activities in the races 

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:12.969
 that as pilots we develop 

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:15.159
 meanwhile please keep the 

00:06:12.969 --> 00:06:17.830
 safe and fun skies place keep 

00:06:15.159 --> 00:06:21.060
 the sky safe and fun in external action 

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:21.060
 See you next time 

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:31.130
