00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.240 
around I don't have to align myself with
the<00:02:00.450> angle<00:02:00.810> of<00:02:00.930> the<00:02:01.080> screen<00:02:01.380> screen<00:02:01.890> always

the angle of the screen screen always
stay<00:02:02.460> static<00:02:02.850> so<00:02:03.479> I<00:02:03.540> can<00:02:03.720> move<00:02:03.840> the<00:02:04.020> tool<00:02:04.200> in

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
stay static so I can move the tool in

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.100 
stay static so I can move the tool in
any<00:02:04.500> direction<00:02:04.710> that<00:02:05.100> I<00:02:05.159> like<00:02:05.490> to<00:02:05.729> actually

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.110

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
which is good so here we go we're going

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.640 
which is good so here we go we're going
through<00:02:32.970> the<00:02:33.090> wall<00:02:33.240> right<00:02:33.540> now<00:02:33.720> and<00:02:34.380> obviously

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
through the wall right now and obviously

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.949 
through the wall right now and obviously
we<00:02:35.069> see<00:02:35.250> something<00:02:35.490> that<00:02:35.700> says<00:02:35.850> the<00:02:36.090> wall<00:02:36.270> we

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
we see something that says the wall we

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:40.540 
we see something that says the wall we
actually<00:02:37.260> put<00:02:37.410> a<00:02:37.440> battery<00:02:37.680> behind<00:02:38.069> this<00:02:38.400> wall

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:40.550 
actually put a battery behind this wall

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:43.970 
actually put a battery behind this wall
so<00:02:41.550> as<00:02:41.790> we're<00:02:42.030> moving<00:02:42.060> it<00:02:42.510> around<00:02:42.810> we<00:02:43.800> can

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
so as we're moving it around we can

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.100 
so as we're moving it around we can
search<00:02:44.310> for<00:02:44.340> trouble<00:02:44.700> spots<00:02:45.180> obviously<00:02:45.810> I<00:02:45.840> see

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
search for trouble spots obviously I see

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:49.160 
search for trouble spots obviously I see
a<00:02:46.140> screw<00:02:46.770> back<00:02:46.950> there<00:02:47.280> and<00:02:47.600> if<00:02:48.600> you<00:02:48.750> wanted<00:02:49.020> to

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
you could put the magnetic bit on and

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.670 
you could put the magnetic bit on and
actually<00:02:51.360> get<00:02:51.600> that<00:02:51.780> screw<00:02:52.080> out<00:02:52.230> through<00:02:52.560> the

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
actually get that screw out through the

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.610 
actually get that screw out through the
hole<00:02:52.860> if<00:02:53.130> you<00:02:53.190> wanted<00:02:53.670> to<00:02:53.850> okay<00:02:54.600> so<00:02:54.780> as<00:02:55.290> we<00:02:55.320> go

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
hole if you wanted to okay so as we go

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.440 
hole if you wanted to okay so as we go

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
through the wall here we're looking

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.270 
through the wall here we're looking
there's<00:02:57.660> a<00:02:57.750> metal<00:02:58.019> stud<00:02:58.290> right<00:02:58.470> there<00:02:58.530> as<00:02:58.860> you

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
there's a metal stud right there as you

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:00.290 
there's a metal stud right there as you
see<00:02:59.430> there's<00:02:59.610> a<00:02:59.640> little<00:02:59.760> bit<00:02:59.940> of<00:02:59.970> glare<00:03:00.269> on

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:00.300 
see there's a little bit of glare on

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.660 
see there's a little bit of glare on
that<00:03:00.630> stud<00:03:00.959> we<00:03:01.560> can<00:03:01.709> correct<00:03:02.040> that<00:03:02.250> with<00:03:02.430> the

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
that stud we can correct that with the

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.610 
that stud we can correct that with the
adjustable<00:03:03.269> LED<00:03:03.420> so<00:03:03.959> we'll<00:03:04.110> tone<00:03:04.320> it<00:03:04.470> down

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
adjustable LED so we'll tone it down

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.250 
adjustable LED so we'll tone it down
just<00:03:04.920> a<00:03:05.040> little<00:03:05.069> bit<00:03:05.430> there<00:03:05.700> and<00:03:05.940> as<00:03:06.930> you<00:03:06.989> can

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
just a little bit there and as you can

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.500 
just a little bit there and as you can
see<00:03:07.410> now<00:03:07.620> no<00:03:07.920> glare<00:03:08.250> so<00:03:09.060> you<00:03:09.120> get<00:03:09.300> a<00:03:09.330> better

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
see now no glare so you get a better

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.330 
see now no glare so you get a better
picture<00:03:09.810> if<00:03:10.170> you<00:03:10.230> play<00:03:10.530> around<00:03:10.739> with<00:03:10.890> the<00:03:11.010> LED

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
picture if you play around with the LED

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:12.530 
picture if you play around with the LED
a<00:03:11.370> little<00:03:11.700> bit<00:03:11.819> just<00:03:12.030> depending<00:03:12.390> on<00:03:12.480> your

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
a little bit just depending on your

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.840 
a little bit just depending on your
environment<00:03:12.950> it's<00:03:13.950> not<00:03:14.100> completely<00:03:14.489> dark

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 
environment it's not completely dark

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:16.850 
environment it's not completely dark
back<00:03:15.090> there<00:03:15.120> obviously<00:03:15.780> but<00:03:16.530> if<00:03:16.650> it<00:03:16.739> was

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860 
back there obviously but if it was

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:18.470 
back there obviously but if it was
completely<00:03:17.069> dark<00:03:17.400> we'd<00:03:17.610> have<00:03:17.760> to<00:03:17.880> juice<00:03:18.269> it<00:03:18.420> up

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
completely dark we'd have to juice it up

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.380 
completely dark we'd have to juice it up
just<00:03:18.690> a<00:03:18.840> little<00:03:19.110> bit<00:03:19.260> so<00:03:20.209> definitely<00:03:21.209> can

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
just a little bit so definitely can

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:22.970 
just a little bit so definitely can
search<00:03:21.690> around<00:03:21.959> looking<00:03:22.260> for<00:03:22.410> trouble<00:03:22.590> spots

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
search around looking for trouble spots

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:25.400 
search around looking for trouble spots
also<00:03:23.340> good<00:03:23.700> thing<00:03:23.880> about<00:03:24.030> this<00:03:24.269> is<00:03:24.570> if<00:03:25.350> you

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
also good thing about this is if you

also good thing about this is if you
wanted<00:03:25.739> to<00:03:25.799> show<00:03:25.950> it<00:03:26.070> to<00:03:26.160> your<00:03:26.250> client<00:03:26.760> or<00:03:26.940> show
