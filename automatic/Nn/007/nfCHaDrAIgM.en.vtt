00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.920

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.840
 always from 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:18.090
 these beats have always produced by 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:21.090
 crowds because I like a lot 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.090

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:33.600

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:48.480
 excavation field yes but it's too much 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.650
 commercial happened common it's too much 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:52.440
