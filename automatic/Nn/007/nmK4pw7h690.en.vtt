00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:09.250
 So love plant friends in this video I show how to Marten and 

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:12.289
 create other night crops looks like 

00:00:12.289 --> 00:00:14.499
 who to the others says shade growths after the same 

00:00:14.499 --> 00:00:18.449
 Procedure Houlihan belongs for example the bomb made which I have here in 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:19.339
 this 

00:00:19.339 --> 00:00:21.810
 Vessel percent overnight 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.759
 soaked percent 

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:26.759
 And not exactly what he exactly with a small splash of detergent 

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:31.179
 he baptized the water absorption bisasam baptized 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
 can have a long time that can ever be three to four weeks 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:36.900
 if you are there 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:40.740
 such as Dirk Percent Tomato Samara you do not have to go astray 

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:43.940
 you can just use it so Pieces are 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:46.850
 To consult for years as usual 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:48.620
 fled after the fact 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:52.370
 not quite replenished with our new sowing so stepped 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:55.550
 it is just pressed with the village Leoben 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:59.820
 so or secondary residence ruled this pot 4 4 I have own percent tomatoes 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.190
 Sorger 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:03.000
 get the cat 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.260
 Nice removed on the edge 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.800
 stuck to the head Merkel also wants to know what that was 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:11.980
 go dashing 

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:14.980
 that Sam Tütchen on the ferry 

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:16.330
 sponsor 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:19.330
 the seeds by lightly tapping the little boy 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.870
 Percent evenly on the surface 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:24.850
 that UBS at a loss 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:28.000
 if that is not completely one hundred percent then you can with the tweezers 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
 then recite the psalms a bit 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.670
 okay that's it 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:43.010
 a tablespoon to 2 degrees on top 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:46.090
 Had an answer 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:48.010
 and done 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:53.890
 Here we are a first about solution with percent one gram per liter 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:54.720
 episode 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.079
 Apple followed the stock market 

00:01:56.079 --> 00:02:00.249
 Berit in the ratio 10 to 10 17 to 15 17 17 goes 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:03.790
 I give it here now in the bowl 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:08.779
 and place your head 

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:10.349
 the general solution 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:14.329
 and let practically the substrate is through Kabila forces from below 

00:02:14.329 --> 00:02:18.540
 Percent absorb this solution you can recognize when the process is over » 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.419
 Abandon the surface 

00:02:20.419 --> 00:02:22.779
 take from the substrate 

00:02:22.779 --> 00:02:26.599
 with the tree collecting tomatoes, it is not just practical that now 

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:29.529
 be taken out of the vessel with the tweezers 

00:02:29.529 --> 00:02:32.139
 it shows that now only exemplary philosophers 

00:02:32.139 --> 00:02:35.139
 Around 50 dealership air back on the surface 

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:38.559
 and distributed them as diplomats said 

00:02:38.559 --> 00:02:40.870
 evenly so that the percent 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.269
 have enough space Wolfgang Maier 

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:45.669
 then returns 

00:02:45.669 --> 00:02:50.439
 As a result, percent on top of that scooping a tablespoon puts the whole thing 

00:02:50.439 --> 00:02:53.439
 Indian Suhl care better 

00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:59.879
 Gloria already had two other 4 percent so Sam has others 

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:02.229
 Formats is underlined 

00:03:02.229 --> 00:03:03.030
 if the 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.829
 superficially you can now see the difference 

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:09.629
 the pot is already the 2 2 followed here it is just set 

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:12.149
 but he wanted a moment 

00:03:12.149 --> 00:03:15.229
 so that the EBIT with us can pack that Washington 

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:18.729
 as far as possible 

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:20.709
 Passenger cars 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:22.929
 wanted to dodge it that way 

00:03:22.929 --> 00:03:25.379
 the glass is placed on 

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:30.089
 and Pröll's seeds are copied at 22 to 24 degrees in 

00:03:31.429 --> 00:03:33.639
 biting germ cells 

00:03:33.639 --> 00:03:38.129
 Above all, it is important to say tomato because tomatoes are very old process 

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:39.339
 grow fast 

00:03:39.339 --> 00:03:40.829
 those were 

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:45.949
 as soon as Sam has accumulated much cooler place otherwise adjourn 

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:48.579
 to distribute the small plantlets in total 

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:51.269
 Endeavor and then overturn easily 

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:56.469
 So that means Modica Emphase 22 to 24 degrees who is not an incubator now 

00:03:56.469 --> 00:03:58.760
 in principle a box of white box 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:00.629
 the turnover will be 

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:04.349
 in the case of tomatoes, this is also in the selection team when he takes a warm spot 

00:04:04.929 --> 00:04:08.559
 Percent next to the living room or in the park I know I have to hook up with him 

00:04:08.559 --> 00:04:12.119
 Nest and Percent then have to but when the seeds germinate them finally 

00:04:12.119 --> 00:04:13.719
 have been 

00:04:13.719 --> 00:04:17.479
 and the man should therefore give to believe in substantial percent 

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:18.989
 Set up temperatures with it 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:21.729
 Plant Estes immediately 

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:25.620
 To create this night plants is just the facade 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:27.330
 that would be percent 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:31.009
 This percent counts American fruit carrying slime plants 

00:04:31.009 --> 00:04:31.639
 to 

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:34.650
 in principle, to have all the other little ones too 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:38.960
 where you have to pay attention to individually what a damper and who need 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:39.779
 so 

00:04:39.779 --> 00:04:44.520
 20 to 24 degrees is actually there for almost everything 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:46.620
 unless it's tropical shorten 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:49.930
 then you should just between 24 and 30 degrees in copying 

00:04:51.189 --> 00:04:54.629
 but we always notice the individual varieties so they just 

00:04:54.629 --> 00:04:58.629
 have to look what ne ne temperature needed on 

00:04:58.629 --> 00:05:01.689
 then they always follow exactly this procedure 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:05.110
 then nothing can go wrong at all 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:09.069
 Well, then wish him much success in their statements and goodbye
