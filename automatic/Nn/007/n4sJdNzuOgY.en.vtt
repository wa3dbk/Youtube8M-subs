00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:04.240
 very good and welcome to a new 

00:00:02.199 --> 00:00:06.339
 video of the geek road channel in 

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:09.719
 this video I will show you how I do 

00:00:06.339 --> 00:00:12.490
 so that in the new and movie max I can 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.080
 how do I do it so I can put two videos 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:17.080
 one next to another or two photographs 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:19.960
 side by side in the same video 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:22.450
 to start we have to have already created 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:23.740
 a project this I'm not going to teach 

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:25.689
 because I imagine that if you are looking for a 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:27.790
 video tutorial on this is because I already 

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:31.060
 you know how to make a new project that is 

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:33.100
 giving equal here and such good will 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:34.870
 try it first with two photographs 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:37.750
 different is done just like with a 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:39.430
 video but we'll take a picture 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:41.920
 fixed is that we are in the directory of 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:43.780
 picture here inside is what I have in 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.040
 my picture we take a picture the 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:47.140
 we select and drag it here 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:49.120
 down well what we want is to put another 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:50.739
 picture to the side to be able to compare a 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:53.860
 photography with another one for example let's 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:56.690
 compare this other photograph from here the 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:01:00.410
 we take it and put it on top 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:02.660
 it's worth how it's selected 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:04.449
 that is in yellow let's touch this 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:09.090
 from here 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:09.090
 and we're going to give it in parallel 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:12.900
 you have seen 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.450
 now the photograph is that it is more 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:18.060
 dark is on the right and is that is 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.220
 clearer is to the left if we do not 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:23.130
 well, giving it here 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.140
 we can change the order value 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.509
 it's just putting the right 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.070
 left as it suits us 

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:31.110
 if we want it to last less time 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:34.110
 up then we take directly and 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:36.689
 we can drag this then what 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:39.390
 it will happen when the time line arrives 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:42.479
 here then the image of 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:45.420
 right and we'll just see a 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:47.420
 photography we are going to give you the start here 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.299
 there are two 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:52.880
 and now only one you see is in the 

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:54.049
 so that in bones or as you say and 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.670
 maybe we do not want it to be 

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:58.700
 move we do not want him to do this is not worth 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:00.710
 Well first we select one we're going 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:03.560
 to give up here where it puts tool 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:05.240
 to cut and it 's put that in boom 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.250
 if we do not want it to move we give it to 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:09.350
 adjust to catch all the 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.840
 whole photograph or crop for 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:13.700
 fill in if we just want it to show a 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.770
 piece but I'm going to give it to adjust so that 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:18.920
 be whole 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:20.690
 and we will accept and in the photograph of 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.830
 up there you have to do the same thing because if 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:23.270
 we do not see that the one on the right does not 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:25.970
 moves and the one above so 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:27.800
 we select is clicking and the 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:30.020
 same operation we touch here we remove the 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:32.750
 game bulls and we put in adjust if 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:35.000
 we would like to cut the image 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:36.800
 then we will only select a piece 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.070
 we want only this piece of 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:42.260
 the door for example then in the 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:44.180
 another one sees the whole photo and in the other 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:46.070
 only the piece of the door is visible if 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:47.690
 we want to modify it because we are late 

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:50.350
 here we give you to adjust so that 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:54.560
 remain whole and now it already 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:56.300
 we would have the same two without moving and 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.390
 side by side if there were two 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:00.680
 videos, it would be exactly the same 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:01.970
 you would have to do the same steps that 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:04.070
 we have done with these photographs but 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:06.020
 with two different videos we would have to 

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:09.260
 look to be synchronized 

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:12.020
 perfectly well that if they have sound 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:13.940
 those videos we will see here the notes of 

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:17.110
 sound on the lines because we had to 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:20.230
 trying to rig the moving one 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:22.690
 so that the notes the audio notes 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:23.890
 be synchronized at the same time and then 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:25.710
 once it was synchronized that 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:29.320
 not only this piece of here and that that 

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:32.320
 we put here we give you to divide the part 

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:35.080
 from here today we directly cut it 

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:37.060
 a little and you're here now 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:38.890
 It would be too much because we cut out a 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:40.180
 piece of the bottom one if we wanted 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:43.060
 leave it the same then simply 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:44.170
 we drag and everything is equal and 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:46.690
 as in the video as I told you 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:48.459
 it's the same so that's how it's like 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:51.670
 I do when I want to make comparisons 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:55.060
 of pictures or videos one next 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:58.440
 of another and simply because I do this that 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:02.340
 is going is that if you put some transition 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:04.230
 / video or these pictures I do not 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:07.140
 I usually put in because they cause me problems 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:08.940
 As you can see , it would not be the same anymore 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:11.340
 I would see one more piece of the top tier 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:13.350
 You can modify it below, but there is no 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:15.480
 water and it's hard for me to look good 

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:17.430
 especially if you put another voucher here 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:19.470
 then I almost always what I do is 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:23.200
 do not put any transition and so I 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:25.690
 great fit next to each other 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:27.010
 worth this video had already done with the 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:28.330
 previous and movie but as I have 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:30.250
 asked for I have decided to do it too 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:32.200
 for this new version so that the 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:34.570
 people who do not know how to do it because they know 

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:37.870
 insert in parallel or in window 

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:40.210
 floating 22 different videos other 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:42.280
 photographs if we wanted to do in 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:43.750
 place of this photograph make a 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:45.160
 floating window what is that then 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:47.740
 we remove this photo for example 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:51.150
 we select we give to erase and we go 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:53.870
 to see a photograph this one of the honda vale 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:56.000
 we would put it on top 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:05:00.680
 ok we do not want it to move around 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:03.060
 example we give here we give you to adjust 

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:06.470
 we do not want the stripes to be seen 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:09.900
 black then we select we play here 

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:11.910
 cut out and we have to put it like that for 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:14.100
 that you do not see the black bands and 

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:17.810
 we play and now here where the 

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:17.810
 little windows before we put 

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:23.610
 in parallel then we will put the image 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:26.099
 inside image 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:29.129
 so as you see now on top of the 

00:05:26.099 --> 00:05:31.560
 another photo we have the image is of 

00:05:29.129 --> 00:05:34.199
 Wave logo is editable we can do it 

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:36.210
 bigger smaller that we can put 

00:05:34.199 --> 00:05:39.150
 shadow 

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:41.370
 here marking this here does not look very 

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:44.490
 ok but good we mark the shadows 

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:46.349
 we take it off and we do this fatter or 

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:47.670
 thinner and we can also change the 

00:05:46.349 --> 00:05:50.040
 colour 

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:53.009
 here comes this 

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:56.249
 for example pink fofi that you see an egg 

00:05:53.009 --> 00:05:58.550
 and when we select it and choose the 

00:05:56.249 --> 00:05:58.550
 colour 

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:02.330
 You see how it changes now 

00:06:03.169 --> 00:06:07.669
 then this image we could already 

00:06:05.169 --> 00:06:09.590
 put on either side of the video because 

00:06:07.669 --> 00:06:11.419
 the thing below could be a video or 

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:13.999
 a photo so we could put by 

00:06:11.419 --> 00:06:16.490
 example a video and this maybe here 

00:06:13.999 --> 00:06:17.800
 put a picture to make it look 

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:20.139
 as 

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:21.770
 as you are seeing right now in this 

00:06:20.139 --> 00:06:24.460
 try what I'm doing 

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:28.990
 is now worth simply giving the play 

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:30.880
 the photo appears there and then it would be removed 

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:32.710
 that's how I do these things with 

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:34.870
 imovie and you know if you have any questions 

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:36.640
 more then do not hesitate to ask me if 

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:38.830
 Can I have some video to explain it? 

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:41.650
 Well nothing if you liked it has served you 

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:43.000
 this video leave me a like share it 

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:45.040
 like those social networks that help 

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.200
 a lot and subscribe if you have not yet 

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:50.340
 You are here to stay tuned for videos like 

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:50.340
 this one is worth a greeting
