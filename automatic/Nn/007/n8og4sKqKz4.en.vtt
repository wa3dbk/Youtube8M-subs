there is a shell back on the pattern and

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:22.910 
there is a shell back on the pattern and
I<00:03:17.440> use<00:03:17.740> a<00:03:18.240> buy<00:03:19.240> it<00:03:19.300> from<00:03:20.170> a<00:03:20.290> duck<00:03:20.500> or<00:03:21.070> a<00:03:21.190> turkey

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
I use a buy it from a duck or a turkey

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:30.970 
I use a buy it from a duck or a turkey
it's<00:03:23.920> tied<00:03:24.190> in<00:03:24.340> on<00:03:24.490> top
