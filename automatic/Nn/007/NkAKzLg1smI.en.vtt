a<00:01:20.909> character<00:01:21.150> storm<00:01:21.509> is<00:01:21.630> easier<00:01:21.900> to<00:01:22.140> listen

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
a character storm is easier to listen

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.320 
a character storm is easier to listen
for<00:01:23.070> your<00:01:23.250> team<00:01:23.549> though<00:01:23.700> that<00:01:23.939> was<00:01:24.060> a<00:01:24.090> better

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330

idea

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
idea

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.870 
idea
III<00:01:25.229> think<00:01:25.590> that's<00:01:25.770> work<00:01:26.100> that's<00:01:26.400> it<00:01:26.640> has<00:01:26.729> to

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
III think that's work that's it has to

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.249 
III think that's work that's it has to
be<00:01:26.970> careful<00:01:27.360> with<00:01:27.509> those<00:01:27.630> assist<00:01:28.020> calls

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
be careful with those assist calls

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.700 
be careful with those assist calls
because<00:01:28.740> that's<00:01:28.950> not<00:01:29.220> safe<00:01:29.520> on<00:01:29.670> Frank<00:01:29.909> West

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:30.710 
because that's not safe on Frank West

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:33.669 
because that's not safe on Frank West
okay
