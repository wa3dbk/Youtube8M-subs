00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
have made one change the cage itself and

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.819 
have made one change the cage itself and
that's<00:00:35.700> putting<00:00:36.120> these<00:00:36.329> hinges<00:00:36.960> in<00:00:37.200> between

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829

that's putting these hinges in between
the<00:00:38.160> lids<00:00:38.399> the<00:00:38.910> reason<00:00:39.239> I<00:00:39.300> did<00:00:39.480> this<00:00:39.629> is

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
the lids the reason I did this is

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.780 
the lids the reason I did this is
because<00:00:39.870> Bertie<00:00:40.710> has<00:00:40.980> been<00:00:41.129> sitting<00:00:41.340> on<00:00:41.579> it<00:00:41.640> a

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
because Bertie has been sitting on it a

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.119 
because Bertie has been sitting on it a
lot<00:00:41.940> recently<00:00:42.210> and<00:00:42.719> unfortunately<00:00:43.680> every

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
lot recently and unfortunately every

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:45.830 
lot recently and unfortunately every
time<00:00:44.160> you<00:00:44.399> sat<00:00:44.610> on<00:00:44.760> iron<00:00:45.090> stands<00:00:45.390> if<00:00:45.600> for<00:00:45.809> some

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
time you sat on iron stands if for some

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.830 
time you sat on iron stands if for some
reason<00:00:46.440> the<00:00:46.829> lid<00:00:47.100> would<00:00:47.370> fall<00:00:47.700> in<00:00:48.000> so<00:00:48.450> now

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
reason the lid would fall in so now

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.600 
reason the lid would fall in so now
these<00:00:49.110> two<00:00:49.170> lids<00:00:49.530> I've<00:00:49.710> joined<00:00:50.219> up<00:00:50.399> it

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
these two lids I've joined up it

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.490 
these two lids I've joined up it
prevents<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:51.030> lid<00:00:51.149> from<00:00:51.210> falling<00:00:51.300> in<00:00:51.780> and<00:00:51.989> it

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
prevents the lid from falling in and it

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.310 
prevents the lid from falling in and it
also<00:00:52.649> allows<00:00:53.160> me<00:00:53.370> to<00:00:53.399> easily<00:00:53.789> open<00:00:54.510> up<00:00:55.020> the<00:00:55.140> lid

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
also allows me to easily open up the lid

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.459 
also allows me to easily open up the lid
I<00:00:56.420> have<00:00:57.420> so<00:00:57.629> much<00:00:57.719> replace<00:00:58.020> it<00:00:58.199> as<00:00:58.289> well

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
I have so much replace it as well

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.619 
I have so much replace it as well
without<00:00:58.770> it<00:00:58.949> getting<00:00:59.070> in<00:00:59.219> the<00:00:59.309> way<00:00:59.460> so<00:00:59.789> I'm

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629
