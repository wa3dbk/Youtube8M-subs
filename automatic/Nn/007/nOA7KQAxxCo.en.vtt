00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:09.939
 let's focus first on the objective 

00:00:09.939 --> 00:00:14.169
 in the front area with the back according to the manufacturer you will find one-two 

00:00:14.169 --> 00:00:17.169
 number followed by a hyphen and a distance millimeters 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:20.570
 24 70 millimeters 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:23.489
 get uncle chop millimeters for example 

00:00:23.489 --> 00:00:27.839
 that is the focal distance of your objective called focal photographic embargo 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.640
 if you have the numbers tendas what is called a goal was a powerful 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.640
 Calvari speak 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.740
 and if you have one, you will have a goal called a fixed focal 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:50.710
 If you have the numbers marked you should look for 1 ring on the target and loved 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:52.260
 the ring of the tum 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.680
 they will turn circle and they will have their joy marked the first of those numbers the 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:58.920
 intermediates and the final number 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.109
 giano and at the same time while doing it 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.799
 Look through the viewfinder of your camera and you will see how the frame changes 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.410
 according to the number do not put the objects will also approach 

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:10.630
 and they will go away 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:14.030
 in digital cameras the lens focal is defined differently 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:19.370
 for example if the nomenclature appears 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:24.250
 eight by means that the goal has from one to eight per 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:26.830
 that is from 35 millimeters 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:28.510
 one by digital 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:34.159
 up to 280 millimeters approximately 280 is the result of multiplying 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:37.159
 35 for 8 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.490
 the ring is one of the digital moves of electronic body 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:45.490
 of the camera 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:50.060
 other very important information that is the one that refers to the luminosity of 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:51.080
 our objetive 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.080
 that is, the ability to put them in bed 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:57.630
 well expressed as follows 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.050
 if you have ubuntu goals to extend to oasis 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:04.330
 1 2 points 3 with 3 billion 5 with six 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.610
 If you're aiming for party seals, you can have something like that 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:13.079
 1 colon 

00:02:13.079 --> 00:02:14.519
 two things 

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:18.449
 in these numerations and the observed always appears the one the left 

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:19.499
 followed by 

00:02:19.499 --> 00:02:20.869
 two points 

00:02:20.869 --> 00:02:25.039
 s1 represents the greatest ability to put what can have a goal 

00:02:25.039 --> 00:02:29.239
 and in front of him after the two points you will see the ability to put those 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:33.699
 have yours against the smallest the number ie the more you 

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:38.119
 closer to 1 brighter was more ability to put them will have 

00:02:38.119 --> 00:02:42.389
 if you have a variable seal objective or funk the same as you have several focal 

00:02:42.389 --> 00:02:46.489
 you will also have several brightness values ​​for each of those few 

00:02:47.669 --> 00:02:53.569
 if you have a 24 70 millimeter you may also have one or two 3 points with 3 

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:56.659
 dash 5 with six 

00:02:56.659 --> 00:03:00.549
 for the objective of 24 millimeters you will have a luminosity value of three 

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:03.549
 with three 

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:07.659
 while for 70 millimeters it was 5 with six 

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:12.689
 for the other focal intermediate values 

00:03:13.679 --> 00:03:17.869
 the fixed focus lenses only have a brightness value since only 

00:03:17.869 --> 00:03:21.179
 they have a focal point but it will be that this value is closer to 1 

00:03:22.669 --> 00:03:24.719
 that means that these objectives are 

00:03:24.719 --> 00:03:26.899
 more luminous than those of variable focal 

00:03:26.899 --> 00:03:30.579
 and that therefore have more ability to put them into the camera than 

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:32.919
 previous 

00:03:32.919 --> 00:03:37.309
 in digital cameras the subject's luminosity theme works the same 

00:03:37.309 --> 00:03:40.179
 that in arrests 

00:03:40.179 --> 00:03:44.409
 many goals also incorporate a bear the diaphragms ring today to 

00:03:44.409 --> 00:03:47.049
 loved also the ring of the openings 

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:51.079
 we will distinguish it by some numbers that are in its mount and because when turning it 

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:54.079
 they produce small tap 

00:03:55.249 --> 00:03:58.589
 This ring is one of the key pieces of the camera 

00:03:58.589 --> 00:04:02.749
 and we say of the camera because many models although they are the objective 

00:04:02.749 --> 00:04:05.629
 It is operated from the body of the camera 

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:10.049
 according to a wheel and at the moment the numbers begin to appear efe hate fran 

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:10.549
 plus 

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:13.309
 which is what these numbers are called 

00:04:13.309 --> 00:04:16.229
 with this ring we will regulate the light input 

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:19.809
 depending on the number we place, more or less light will pass to the camera 

00:04:19.809 --> 00:04:24.269
 in digital the Hamas dayz ring works in a similar way and is regulated 

00:04:24.269 --> 00:04:27.269
 from the body as the autofocus recess 

00:04:32.189 --> 00:04:35.089
 next to this are other numbers that will be part of another 

00:04:35.089 --> 00:04:38.909
 key piece of our camera we refer to the speed wheel of 

00:04:38.909 --> 00:04:40.229
 obturation 

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:43.909
 the normal thing is that these numbers go from values ​​that are whole seconds 

00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:47.719
 you distinguish them by the commas that appear on your right or by and followed by 

00:04:47.719 --> 00:04:48.650
 the letter s 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:51.370
 up second functions that could reach 2000 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:54.370
 or four thousand for example 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:59.280
 you should never confuse these values ​​with the values ​​of snow the diaphragm 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:03.419
 note that these numbers are much smaller, although be careful because 

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:06.419
 at some point they can be very similar 

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:15.439
 the speed wheel is invalid the other important piece the shutter 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:18.990
 open the body of the camera 

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:21.580
 eye as long as you do not have a roll 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:25.479
 and look at that black pin that you have there, be careful not to enter 

00:05:25.479 --> 00:05:30.340
 temptations do not you think it was touching or joking we are facing another very 

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:34.169
 finely balanced and any pressure especially if it is repeated given 

00:05:34.169 --> 00:05:36.860
 the clubs would balance 

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:38.450
 observe its operation 

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:42.280
 To do this, place the value 1 in the speed wheel, after pressing the 

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:44.939
 trigger 

00:05:44.939 --> 00:05:47.969
 that curtain remained open a whole second 

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:51.520
 let's put another value 

00:05:53.919 --> 00:05:56.360
 now instead it has been closed before 

00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:00.389
 there you have it with that roulette you will control the time sastoque that 

00:06:00.389 --> 00:06:03.029
 curtain will be open 

00:06:03.029 --> 00:06:06.669
 you are going to regulate therefore the passage of light to the photographic film 

00:06:07.309 --> 00:06:08.500
 since this one 

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:12.490
 there is always enough behind the other side waiting to receive the image 

00:06:13.879 --> 00:06:17.879
 in the mechanical reflex cameras this is exactly the same although the roulette 

00:06:17.879 --> 00:06:20.879
 the speeds is a bit more rudimentary 

00:06:24.869 --> 00:06:28.809
 digital cameras although it goes into a different process at the end everything comes 

00:06:28.809 --> 00:06:30.160
 to be very similar 

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:33.980
 they use the same shutter speeds as the cameras refresh 

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:35.379
 conventional 

00:06:35.379 --> 00:06:39.300
 these cameras are continually letting through and therefore the 

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:43.779
 image when shooting the photo it is recorded resembling a lot the 

00:06:43.779 --> 00:06:45.699
 process before the video camera
