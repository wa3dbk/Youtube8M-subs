 quick after you hit strikes 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.820
 of course 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:32.810

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:34.760
 versatile environmental 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:37.280

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:55.159
 turban and then the vant of response 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.600
 to confess capital again whenever 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:58.790
 this movement in a way where only 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.800
 will have enemies coming from the front this 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:02.390
 part where I was I knew that the guy 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:04.040
 came from behind and from behind but like 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.450
 was with versatile was not so much 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:08.209
 afraid this time I die I do not know why 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.619
 but always try to move one 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:13.969
 way you will only face head 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:16.189
 even use cpu the wall as a way 

00:02:13.969 --> 00:02:17.689
 Kind of how can I say a way to 

00:02:16.189 --> 00:02:19.130
 where you will know that he does not 

00:02:17.689 --> 00:02:20.540
 will see nobody use 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:22.610
 always a way that you move 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:25.430
 and the following places where you will always 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:27.560
 Gree network for you and a certain kind of little 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:30.020
 red glitch beauty of which reports a 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:32.210
 Look, I 'm waiting for you, man, and always kill. 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:34.190
 this movement in this way will never 

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:35.810
 by the means there in this political map is a 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:37.490
 difficult to move around because it has 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:39.710
 where you can see the enemy and 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:41.750
 lots of glee titles right right 

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:44.300
 Through there you have several paths. 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:46.910
 where the faces can stay in the corners for 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:49.070
 behind the front is very difficult only 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:50.840
 moves through the corners goes through the site 

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:53.690

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:56.300

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:58.010
 move only in places I'll tell you 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:59.870
 You have to win the faces of the guys. 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:01.400
 not that she may have to sleep nation 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:03.770

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.330
 behind you all the time that I now 

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:13.340
 The milk was there inside the 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:15.200

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:25.820
 in a smart way 

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:27.350
 if you have a good triton type headset 

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:30.200
