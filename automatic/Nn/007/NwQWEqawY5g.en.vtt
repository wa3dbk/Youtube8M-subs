the<00:01:56.100> 12<00:01:56.369> to<00:01:56.460> 24<00:01:57.500> is<00:01:58.500> the<00:01:58.799> bit<00:01:58.979> superiors<00:01:59.520> who

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
the 12 to 24 is the bit superiors who

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.789 
the 12 to 24 is the bit superiors who
will<00:01:59.820> say<00:02:00.000> well<00:02:00.149> you<00:02:00.180> know<00:02:00.570> the<00:02:00.719> 10<00:02:00.960> to<00:02:01.079> 24<00:02:01.530> it

will say well you know the 10 to 24 it

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.100 
will say well you know the 10 to 24 it
goes<00:02:01.979> out<00:02:02.219> wider<00:02:02.520> than<00:02:02.850> the<00:02:02.969> 12<00:02:03.210> to<00:02:03.360> 20<00:02:03.600> so

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
goes out wider than the 12 to 20 so

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.420 
goes out wider than the 12 to 20 so
 what<00:02:04.740> there's<00:02:05.040> a<00:02:05.100> lot<00:02:05.250> more

 what there's a lot more
distortion<00:02:06.030> at<00:02:06.149> 10<00:02:06.360> to<00:02:06.479> 12<00:02:06.719> in<00:02:06.869> there<00:02:06.990> on<00:02:07.229> this

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
distortion at 10 to 12 in there on this

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:10.279 
distortion at 10 to 12 in there on this
lens<00:02:07.680> you're<00:02:08.520> gaining<00:02:08.729> two<00:02:09.209> extra<00:02:09.780> you're

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
lens you're gaining two extra you're

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:11.920 
lens you're gaining two extra you're
getting<00:02:10.500> two<00:02:10.679> millimeters<00:02:11.099> more<00:02:11.310> on<00:02:11.459> the

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
getting two millimeters more on the

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.280 
getting two millimeters more on the
24:19<00:02:12.530> 1224<00:02:13.219> but<00:02:13.519> at<00:02:13.909> that<00:02:14.239> range<00:02:14.569> all<00:02:14.959> the<00:02:15.170> way

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
24:19 1224 but at that range all the way

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.830 
24:19 1224 but at that range all the way
open<00:02:15.650> it's<00:02:16.370> got<00:02:16.549> bad<00:02:16.730> chromatic<00:02:17.120> aberration

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
open it's got bad chromatic aberration

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.259 
open it's got bad chromatic aberration
it's<00:02:18.049> got<00:02:18.200> bad<00:02:18.379> fall-off<00:02:18.980> got<00:02:19.370> bad<00:02:19.579> distortion

00:02:20.259 --> 00:02:20.269 
it's got bad fall-off got bad distortion

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:23.170 
it's got bad fall-off got bad distortion
so<00:02:20.709> yeah<00:02:21.709> they<00:02:21.920> added<00:02:22.280> two<00:02:22.430> millimeters<00:02:22.969> more

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
so yeah they added two millimeters more

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.059 
so yeah they added two millimeters more
to<00:02:23.269> the<00:02:23.359> focal<00:02:23.719> length<00:02:23.750> but<00:02:24.439> they<00:02:24.530> also<00:02:24.680> made

00:02:25.059 --> 00:02:25.069 
to the focal length but they also made

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:28.270 
to the focal length but they also made
it<00:02:25.099> in<00:02:25.310> China<00:02:25.959> by<00:02:26.959> slave<00:02:27.290> labor<00:02:27.319> instead<00:02:28.129> of

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
it in China by slave labor instead of

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.059 
it in China by slave labor instead of
made<00:02:28.459> in<00:02:28.609> Japan<00:02:29.079> it's<00:02:30.079> still<00:02:30.319> a<00:02:30.349> good<00:02:30.530> lens<00:02:30.769> if
