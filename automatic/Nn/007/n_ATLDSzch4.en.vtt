00:00:03.129 --> 00:00:08.710
 hello very good to all kids I wanted 

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:10.840
 first of all start the video give the 

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:13.330
 thanks to all of us who are already in the 

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:16.810
 channel that we are already almost 100 walk 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:19.720
 over 95 I almost believe it's already already 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:22.029
 there will be a special 100 subscribers and 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:24.699
 thank you very much everyone and good in this 

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:27.009
 video I wanted to explain a little how 

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:28.890
 you can remove the water from your aquarium 

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:30.769
 what do you see 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.550
 mine is there is the uah 

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:34.530
 perfectly I do not know if in the video it 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:38.129
 you will appreciate how it is but as we if 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:40.559
 is now a take a close shot what 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:43.910
 I wanted to come and explain is a 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:46.080
 product that is in the store that are 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:48.300
 many cans and also many things that 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:52.320
 are the ceramic rings but in this 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:55.920
 case is of the brand wax and are the 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.750
 rings and by anses that are some rings 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.940
 in the form of 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:03.420
 as if they were very chiquititas canica 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:05.730
 that those can have a mesh inside 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:09.659
 of your filter or how I have put a 

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:13.049
 specific filter nothing more than that 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.789
 It has been 24 hours what has taken 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:17.189
 put on the water like that because I wanted to 

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:22.020
 singing was a poor the subject of the 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:23.429
 nitrates and all that and I thought it was 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.890
 poor if he was doing changer 

00:01:23.429 --> 00:01:28.210
 water and it turns out that was what was missing 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:31.409
 of battery in the aquarium 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:35.200
 total that I went to buy that goes a kilo 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:37.620
 DanÃ­a on about 10-12 euros I did not 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.780
 agreement very well 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:42.300
 and I also bought a filter that were 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:46.150
 twelve euros then the filter that now 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:49.240
 I will teach it has inside the rings 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:51.310
 they are 300 liters but more or less it will be 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:55.300
 for about 200 but what I intend is 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:58.980
 that nest in the subject I'm also going to 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:58.980
 teach here I have a little boat 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:05.460
 if the camera focuses 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:07.860
 is that it does not look very good 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:10.289
 it's called will be it filters the well-being that 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:13.050
 all very little educational amount the 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:15.360
 bacteria and also with this from the 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:18.360
 tropical brand that I do not know if you will see 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:20.520
 there they are are beneficial bacteria 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:23.220
 for the aquarium that you see is the 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:25.440
 good perfect water was seized and I already 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:28.200
 I'm going to take a little bit of form here 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:31.620
 I've always given the fish a little 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:34.310
 so that inside 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.310
 in small amount 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:38.920
 You already know that we left you cold not 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:40.870
 have the vision that for example has 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:42.310
 those of salt water we call them cold 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:44.980
 is that they do not have the thing there 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:46.540
 he does not see her as you see them as soon as they see 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:48.460
 you pass a little bit the food and 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:49.930
 down already quite her and I have to 

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:52.660
 take a few times about everything 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:55.030
 whole surface food 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:57.110
 and well I will go to teach you to 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:03:00.530
 owe to each here this 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:03.840
 how is the water so you can 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:05.819
 observe here as this one declares 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:08.010
 look at the transparency how the 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:10.069
 colors of the times you see looks very 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.069
 all right 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:15.180
 here you have the fish that we are going to be 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:19.920
 they are perfectly in about 100 liters 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:22.680
 comets these are perfect 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:24.700
 the egg bet I do not know if it will look 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:27.610
 here 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:28.840
 but there are little left in the branches 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:31.810
 although I think they have been eating 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:35.319
 the parents and as you see here 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:37.640
 I have the filter that I have told you are not 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:40.410
 It is a very large filter 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:43.600
 to see if he focuses the camera 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:47.090
 I also have very dirty glass 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:50.330
 why not clean them in a circle 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:52.550
 and well here, it will be better down there 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:54.680
 you will see a small opening that 

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:58.840
 connected the wall and that the colors 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:04:02.220
 those of the rings and 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:05.040
 and that's what the filter consists of 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:07.650
 in which memorize the water and accumulate and 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:09.810
 inside the bacteria and see if the 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:11.940
 result of the water is 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:15.690
 clear white clear with here still 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:17.220
 even being cold water water 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:20.070
 the runner is when she is 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:22.250
 enduring very well in fact now in 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:26.370
 summer is climbing alone 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:27.690
 about about 23 degrees here you can 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:29.400
 observe macho that can be recognized 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:32.430
 for the little points he has here 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:35.190
 in super butt and in the front of 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:37.410
 the fin and well over here there are some 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:41.730
 planes that try to eat this I think 

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:44.610
 which is already in the last organs and 

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:47.100
 good the telescopic for now it goes well 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:49.280
 It is very comfortable I still have not 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:49.280
 complained 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:54.380
 there was no problem any 

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:56.289
 disease or anything or that the aquarium 

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:58.659
 for now perfect 

00:04:56.289 --> 00:05:00.699
 I just wanted to come and say that and we 

00:04:58.659 --> 00:05:03.960
 we see in the next video that I hope that 

00:05:00.699 --> 00:05:06.300
 be the special of the 100 subscribers 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:10.460
 Come on, lad, we'll see you said here in a 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:10.460
 plane with the aquarium in the background
