00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
here's here's things that I think this

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:52.910 
here's here's things that I think this
game<00:03:49.920> has<00:03:50.160> going<00:03:50.519> for<00:03:50.549> it<00:03:51.200> one<00:03:52.200> is<00:03:52.440> you<00:03:52.470> see

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:52.920 
game has going for it one is you see

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.340 
game has going for it one is you see

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:55.350 
characters that appear in other games so

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:57.520

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:57.530 
you'll get back story to characters who

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:59.509 
you'll get back story to characters who
didn't<00:03:58.530> have<00:03:58.620> back<00:03:58.769> story<00:03:58.980> before<00:03:59.130> that'll<00:03:59.459> be

with lots of signatures on them but

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:46.930 
with lots of signatures on them but
that's<00:04:45.260> not<00:04:45.560> always<00:04:45.830> an<00:04:46.070> easy<00:04:46.160> task<00:04:46.520> and<00:04:46.760> not

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:46.940 
that's not always an easy task and not

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:49.000 
that's not always an easy task and not
doesn't<00:04:47.450> always<00:04:47.660> bear<00:04:47.870> the<00:04:48.020> best<00:04:48.230> fruit<00:04:48.500> when

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:49.010 
doesn't always bear the best fruit when

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:51.910 
doesn't always bear the best fruit when
you<00:04:49.160> take<00:04:49.400> a<00:04:49.430> previous<00:04:49.940> gen<00:04:50.320> game<00:04:51.320> and<00:04:51.560> port<00:04:51.830> it

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:51.920 
you take a previous gen game and port it

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:54.460 
you take a previous gen game and port it
to<00:04:51.950> the<00:04:52.070> next<00:04:52.220> gen<00:04:52.490> I<00:04:53.270> think<00:04:53.630> if<00:04:53.720> you<00:04:53.870> adjust

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:54.470 
to the next gen I think if you adjust

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:56.830 
to the next gen I think if you adjust
what<00:04:54.740> you<00:04:54.890> expect<00:04:55.550> this<00:04:55.640> game<00:04:55.850> to<00:04:56.060> be<00:04:56.090> it's

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:56.840 
what you expect this game to be it's

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:58.750 
what you expect this game to be it's
going<00:04:57.080> to<00:04:57.110> be<00:04:57.230> pretty<00:04:57.350> outstanding<00:04:57.710> at<00:04:58.520> least

00:04:58.750 --> 00:04:58.760 
going to be pretty outstanding at least
