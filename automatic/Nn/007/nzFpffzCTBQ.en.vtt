00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.220 
it
this<00:02:28.709> one<00:02:28.920> is<00:02:29.040> the<00:02:29.190> easiest<00:02:29.750> for<00:02:30.750> me<00:02:30.780> at<00:02:31.170> least

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
this one is the easiest for me at least

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:34.670 
this one is the easiest for me at least
but<00:02:32.220> I'm<00:02:32.430> pretty<00:02:32.640> sure<00:02:32.880> it's<00:02:33.840> all<00:02:34.380> together

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
but I'm pretty sure it's all together

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:39.110 
but I'm pretty sure it's all together
the<00:02:34.980> easiest<00:02:36.080> it's<00:02:37.080> you<00:02:38.069> don't<00:02:38.220> vibrate<00:02:38.790> your

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
the easiest it's you don't vibrate your

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.310 
the easiest it's you don't vibrate your
tongue<00:02:39.330> or<00:02:39.569> anything<00:02:39.780> it's<00:02:40.080> the<00:02:40.140> rule<00:02:40.730> and

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:42.320 
tongue or anything it's the rule and

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:46.550 
tongue or anything it's the rule and
