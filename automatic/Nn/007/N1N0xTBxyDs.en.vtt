00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:45.340 

immediately<00:00:44.030> we<00:00:44.210> came<00:00:44.420> across<00:00:44.540> one<00:00:45.170> of<00:00:45.200> these

immediately we came across one of these

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:50.500 
immediately we came across one of these
catfish<00:00:46.210> locally<00:00:47.210> known<00:00:47.390> as<00:00:47.450> camp<00:00:47.870> angle<00:00:49.510> as

ended<00:00:59.930> up<00:01:00.050> going<00:01:00.320> to<00:01:00.500> the<00:01:00.620> edge<00:01:00.710> of<00:01:00.800> a<00:01:00.920> Ledge

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:01.100 
ended up going to the edge of a Ledge

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:07.560 
ended up going to the edge of a Ledge
before<00:01:01.550> sinking<00:01:01.940> down<00:01:02.180> into<00:01:02.690> the<00:01:02.780> inky<00:01:03.080> depths

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:07.570 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:09.850 

shortly<00:01:08.570> afterwards<00:01:09.080> I<00:01:09.170> came<00:01:09.350> across<00:01:09.470> another

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:09.860 
shortly afterwards I came across another

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:13.390 
shortly afterwards I came across another
catfish<00:01:10.900> was<00:01:11.900> just<00:01:12.080> sitting<00:01:12.740> over<00:01:12.860> the<00:01:13.100> sand

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:13.400 
catfish was just sitting over the sand

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:17.620 
catfish was just sitting over the sand
and<00:01:13.729> gyrating<00:01:14.420> its<00:01:14.509> body<00:01:14.750> slightly<00:01:16.630> perhaps

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:17.630 
and gyrating its body slightly perhaps

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:19.570 
and gyrating its body slightly perhaps
it<00:01:17.899> was<00:01:18.110> attempting<00:01:18.590> to<00:01:18.680> pick<00:01:18.830> up<00:01:19.009> any

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:19.580 
it was attempting to pick up any

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:21.550 
it was attempting to pick up any
electrical<00:01:20.149> vibrations<00:01:20.410> through<00:01:21.410> its

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:21.560 
electrical vibrations through its

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:34.670 
electrical vibrations through its
feelers<00:01:22.039> and<00:01:22.070> pick<00:01:22.460> up<00:01:22.580> any<00:01:22.729> potential<00:01:23.270> prey

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.340 

we<00:01:35.220> continued<00:01:35.700> along<00:01:35.970> and<00:01:36.360> quite<00:01:37.080> a<00:01:37.110> few

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
we continued along and quite a few

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.410 
we continued along and quite a few
cycles<00:01:37.620> at<00:01:37.890> the<00:01:37.980> bottom

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.450 

eh<00:01:42.990> they<00:01:43.200> came<00:01:43.380> across<00:01:43.500> another<00:01:43.800> little<00:01:44.160> crab

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
eh they came across another little crab

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:52.450 
eh they came across another little crab
scurrying<00:01:45.390> across<00:01:45.510> the<00:01:45.870> bottom

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:52.460 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:55.330 

and<00:01:53.210> as<00:01:53.330> I<00:01:53.450> turned<00:01:53.750> to<00:01:53.930> have<00:01:54.620> a<00:01:54.650> closer<00:01:54.980> look<00:01:55.130> at

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340 
and as I turned to have a closer look at

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:56.650 
and as I turned to have a closer look at
the<00:01:55.460> crab<00:01:55.700> you'd<00:01:55.940> made<00:01:56.120> his<00:01:56.240> way<00:01:56.420> it's<00:01:56.570> a

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:56.660 
the crab you'd made his way it's a

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:58.420 
the crab you'd made his way it's a
little<00:01:56.780> galley<00:01:57.080> of<00:01:57.200> sand<00:01:57.650> in<00:01:57.860> between<00:01:58.220> two

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:58.430 
little galley of sand in between two

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:00.880 
little galley of sand in between two
rocks<00:01:58.670> and<00:01:58.940> in<00:01:59.810> the<00:01:59.930> silt<00:02:00.230> he'd<00:02:00.410> kind<00:02:00.800> of

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890 
rocks and in the silt he'd kind of

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:05.910 
rocks and in the silt he'd kind of
nestled<00:02:01.310> himself<00:02:01.670> to<00:02:01.850> escape<00:02:02.120> our<00:02:02.300> attention

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:05.920 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.139 

perhaps<00:02:06.920> eventually<00:02:07.160> we<00:02:07.550> became<00:02:07.850> too<00:02:08.119> much

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149 
perhaps eventually we became too much

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:11.949 
perhaps eventually we became too much
and<00:02:08.330> you<00:02:08.869> decided<00:02:09.170> to<00:02:09.289> scurry<00:02:09.590> off<00:02:10.959> and

00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:11.959 
and you decided to scurry off and

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:22.990 
and you decided to scurry off and
continue<00:02:12.410> foraging<00:02:12.890> for<00:02:12.920> the<00:02:13.130> evening

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.180 

now<00:02:23.600> this<00:02:23.750> is<00:02:23.900> a<00:02:23.930> fascinating<00:02:24.320> and<00:02:24.770> beautiful

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
now this is a fascinating and beautiful

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:27.610 
now this is a fascinating and beautiful
fish<00:02:25.400> this<00:02:25.610> is<00:02:25.670> the<00:02:26.000> proto<00:02:26.360> MELAS<00:02:26.660> and<00:02:26.900> it's

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
fish this is the proto MELAS and it's

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:29.320 
fish this is the proto MELAS and it's
the<00:02:27.710> first<00:02:27.950> time<00:02:28.160> on<00:02:28.430> this<00:02:28.520> expedition<00:02:28.910> that

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.330 
the first time on this expedition that

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.030 
the first time on this expedition that
I've<00:02:29.450> had<00:02:29.630> an<00:02:29.720> opportunity<00:02:29.960> to<00:02:30.620> be<00:02:30.740> able<00:02:30.830> to

from every clutch will actually make it

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:27.060
