00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:46.320
 Well in the first place 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:48.280
 Image quality is completely different 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.000
 It is the number of pixels 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.000
 To compare 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:57.610
 It may be a pity but 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:01:01.300
 Hold with both hands 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:03.760

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:25.220

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:31.260

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.850
 Because it was a bit too heavy 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:22.660

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:22.660
