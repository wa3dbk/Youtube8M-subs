00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:05.209
 in this video I'll show you how 

00:00:02.689 --> 00:00:08.330
 prepare the warm eggs is a 

00:00:05.209 --> 00:00:10.520
 request of my friend arafat or be it 

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:13.930
 I send a greeting I hope you like the 

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:13.930
 way of how you prepare them 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:33.450
 and the only thing we're going to need is 

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:35.690
 eggs and an iron colander I'm going to 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.370
 boil water in a container 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:40.500
 when the water started to boil I'm going to 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.079
 put a tablespoon of salt I'll 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.590
 stir a little to dissolve the 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.110
 random 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.359
 I'm going to put the eggs in the colander and 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.910
 I'm going to put it in the colander in the 

00:00:48.359 --> 00:00:51.980
 ollita 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:53.870
 in this way so that the eggs do not 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:57.890
 go bouncing and going to break 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:01:01.010
 let's count 5 minutes from that 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:03.860
 we put the eggs into the water exactly 5 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:05.870
 minutes and we're going to take them out when 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:08.540
 miss a minute to get a new one in 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:11.690
 the water I'm going to put in a container a 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:13.369
 little ice water here we go to 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:15.770
 lay the eggs immediately after 

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:17.479
 to get them out of the boiling water here 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:20.060
 we see how the eggs are boiling and 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:22.550
 they do not move at all when we put 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.410
 the eggs directly in the pot 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:28.070
 eggs go bouncing and many times they 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:29.840
 they break exactly at 5 minutes I'm going 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:32.450
 to take the eggs out of the water I'm going to turn off 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.759
 the fire and I will take them directly 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:37.729
 to the icy water with the ready I had 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:39.680
 here and here we are going to leave them about 2 or 3 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:42.320
 minutes to cool and be able to 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:44.660
 peel and when we see that the egg is 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.600
 fine we will take what we will put 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:48.270
 a napkin and we are going to dry it 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.050
 perfectly 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.750
 to fight 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:56.590
 we 're going to hit around that 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:58.620
 stain the entire shell well this way 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:58.620
 way 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.060
 we are going to hit all around and that 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.150
 splinter perfectly in the shell 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:13.220
 all 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:15.640
 and I 'm going to put a little sauce 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.640
 of soy 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:22.850
 I'm going to put him played may and a little 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:26.370
 English type sauce or the one called 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:29.370
 word and there I do not know what it's called in English 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:31.770
 in English sauce and I'm going to put 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.780
 also a little bit of sauce is tamaris 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:34.500
 that it was you can put the highs that 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.260
 you want 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:40.730
 I love them where they are those you 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.730
 I'm going to put some lemon 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:49.750
 I'm not going to put this in the video 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:53.110
 because if it looks like you do not see a 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:55.860
 little appetizing looks like it looks 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:03:00.990
 a little bit like that that guacara but 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:00.990
 this the truth that yes it is delicious 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:07.770
 very rich I hope you liked this 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:10.430
