the rest talking about you I think the
thing<00:03:05.610> about<00:03:06.000> rihanna<00:03:06.300> is<00:03:06.420> that<00:03:06.540> she's

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
thing about rihanna is that she's

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.780 
thing about rihanna is that she's
completely<00:03:07.140> innovated<00:03:07.830> herself<00:03:08.220> time<00:03:08.640> and

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
completely innovated herself time and

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:10.730 
completely innovated herself time and
time<00:03:08.880> again<00:03:08.910> every<00:03:09.840> album<00:03:10.020> it's<00:03:10.350> a<00:03:10.410> new<00:03:10.530> look

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:10.740 
time again every album it's a new look

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:13.160 
time again every album it's a new look
it's<00:03:11.070> new<00:03:11.220> music<00:03:11.580> it's<00:03:11.700> a<00:03:11.760> new<00:03:11.850> sound<00:03:12.060> and<00:03:12.270> I

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
it's new music it's a new sound and I

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:14.330 
it's new music it's a new sound and I
think<00:03:13.380> that's<00:03:13.590> what<00:03:13.710> keeps<00:03:13.830> her<00:03:13.980> you<00:03:14.220> know

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
think that's what keeps her you know
