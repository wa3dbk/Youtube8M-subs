and<00:00:38.620> let<00:00:39.100> me<00:00:39.220> talk<00:00:39.430> a<00:00:39.460> little<00:00:39.550> bit<00:00:39.940> about<00:00:39.970> the

and let me talk a little bit about the

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:42.479 
and let me talk a little bit about the
passives<00:00:40.780> because<00:00:41.140> they<00:00:41.320> have<00:00:41.500> some<00:00:41.800> common

00:00:42.479 --> 00:00:42.489 
passives because they have some common

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:45.090 
passives because they have some common
features<00:00:42.670> first<00:00:43.480> of<00:00:43.720> all<00:00:43.870> each<00:00:44.380> electro<00:00:44.980> boy

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:45.100 
features first of all each electro boy

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:47.220 
features first of all each electro boy
speaker<00:00:45.640> starts<00:00:45.940> always<00:00:46.720> with<00:00:47.020> the

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:47.230 
speaker starts always with the

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:49.319 
speaker starts always with the
development<00:00:47.890> of<00:00:48.100> the<00:00:48.280> woofers<00:00:48.579> and<00:00:49.000> of<00:00:49.180> the

00:00:49.319 --> 00:00:49.329 
development of the woofers and of the

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:51.510 
development of the woofers and of the
drivers<00:00:49.780> so<00:00:50.380> we<00:00:50.559> are<00:00:50.649> not<00:00:50.800> taking<00:00:51.250> anything

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:51.520 
drivers so we are not taking anything

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:53.910 
drivers so we are not taking anything
from<00:00:51.910> the<00:00:52.120> shelf<00:00:52.390> that<00:00:52.630> we<00:00:52.809> have<00:00:52.989> already<00:00:53.410> know

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:53.920 
from the shelf that we have already know

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.240 
from the shelf that we have already know
we<00:00:54.510> individually<00:00:55.510> create<00:00:56.020> the<00:00:56.649> speakers<00:00:57.100> and

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:57.250 
we individually create the speakers and

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:58.770 
we individually create the speakers and
the<00:00:57.370> woofers<00:00:57.730> that<00:00:57.910> we<00:00:58.059> are<00:00:58.180> using<00:00:58.390> in<00:00:58.660> our

00:00:58.770 --> 00:00:58.780 
the woofers that we are using in our

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:01.979 
the woofers that we are using in our
lines<00:00:59.280> one<00:01:00.280> very<00:01:00.610> good<00:01:00.700> example<00:01:01.480> of<00:01:01.660> the

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:01.989 
lines one very good example of the

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:04.560 
lines one very good example of the
sophisticated<00:01:02.969> development<00:01:03.969> projects<00:01:04.540> that

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:04.570 
sophisticated development projects that

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:07.459 
sophisticated development projects that
we<00:01:04.839> have<00:01:05.019> here<00:01:05.320> is<00:01:05.710> this<00:01:06.009> split<00:01:06.639> baffle<00:01:07.149> design

00:01:07.459 --> 00:01:07.469 
we have here is this split baffle design

00:01:07.469 --> 00:01:10.529 
we have here is this split baffle design
that<00:01:08.469> split<00:01:08.799> baffle<00:01:09.219> design<00:01:09.249> takes<00:01:09.969> care<00:01:10.299> that

00:01:10.529 --> 00:01:10.539 
that split baffle design takes care that

00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:12.569 
that split baffle design takes care that
the<00:01:10.990> zero<00:01:11.229> points<00:01:11.679> of<00:01:11.829> the<00:01:11.979> woofer<00:01:12.340> and<00:01:12.369> the

00:01:12.569 --> 00:01:12.579 
the zero points of the woofer and the

00:01:12.579 --> 00:01:14.489 
the zero points of the woofer and the
zero<00:01:12.819> points<00:01:13.209> of<00:01:13.329> the<00:01:13.450> driver<00:01:13.749> are<00:01:14.049> in<00:01:14.350> the

00:01:14.489 --> 00:01:14.499 
zero points of the driver are in the

00:01:14.499 --> 00:01:17.550 
zero points of the driver are in the
same<00:01:14.770> level<00:01:15.159> that<00:01:15.490> means<00:01:16.209> that<00:01:16.869> the<00:01:17.049> signals

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:17.560 
same level that means that the signals

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.559 
same level that means that the signals
are<00:01:17.770> dispatched<00:01:18.340> at<00:01:18.549> the<00:01:18.700> same<00:01:18.909> time<00:01:19.270> and

00:01:19.559 --> 00:01:19.569 
are dispatched at the same time and

00:01:19.569 --> 00:01:21.300 
are dispatched at the same time and
therefore<00:01:19.749> reach<00:01:20.289> your<00:01:20.560> ear<00:01:20.829> at<00:01:20.979> the<00:01:21.130> same

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:21.310 
therefore reach your ear at the same

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:24.029 
therefore reach your ear at the same
time<00:01:21.609> and<00:01:22.600> in<00:01:22.869> consequence<00:01:23.439> you<00:01:23.590> have<00:01:23.619> a<00:01:23.770> much

00:01:24.029 --> 00:01:24.039 
time and in consequence you have a much

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:25.830 
time and in consequence you have a much
better<00:01:24.249> clarity<00:01:24.759> and<00:01:25.149> you<00:01:25.329> have<00:01:25.509> a<00:01:25.539> much

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:25.840 
better clarity and you have a much

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.529 
better clarity and you have a much
better<00:01:26.490> determination<00:01:27.490> and<00:01:27.729> pressure<00:01:28.149> off

00:01:28.529 --> 00:01:28.539 
better determination and pressure off

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:30.209 
better determination and pressure off
the<00:01:28.749> signal<00:01:28.959> that's<00:01:29.259> what<00:01:29.590> you<00:01:29.709> really<00:01:29.920> want

00:01:30.209 --> 00:01:30.219 
the signal that's what you really want

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:33.179 
the signal that's what you really want
as<00:01:30.450> you<00:01:31.450> can<00:01:31.659> see<00:01:31.869> here<00:01:32.139> it's<00:01:32.560> a<00:01:32.679> multi-purpose

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:33.189 
as you can see here it's a multi-purpose

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:35.969 
as you can see here it's a multi-purpose
houses<00:01:33.729> you<00:01:33.880> have<00:01:33.909> this<00:01:34.810> thing<00:01:35.109> as<00:01:35.289> a<00:01:35.319> monitor

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:35.979 
houses you have this thing as a monitor

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:38.249 
houses you have this thing as a monitor
you<00:01:36.490> can<00:01:36.520> put<00:01:36.939> it<00:01:37.090> on<00:01:37.209> a<00:01:37.270> pole<00:01:37.599> or<00:01:37.929> there<00:01:38.139> is<00:01:38.229> a

00:01:38.249 --> 00:01:38.259 
you can put it on a pole or there is a

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:40.279 
you can put it on a pole or there is a
wall<00:01:38.499> bracket<00:01:38.889> available<00:01:39.399> for<00:01:39.609> it<00:01:39.700> as<00:01:39.819> well

00:01:40.279 --> 00:01:40.289 
wall bracket available for it as well

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:42.929 
wall bracket available for it as well
now<00:01:41.289> let<00:01:41.590> me<00:01:41.619> talk<00:01:41.889> a<00:01:41.950> little<00:01:42.069> bit<00:01:42.459> about<00:01:42.490> the

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:42.939 
now let me talk a little bit about the

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:45.300 
now let me talk a little bit about the
handles<00:01:43.389> here<00:01:43.990> it's<00:01:44.170> a<00:01:44.259> new<00:01:44.439> handle<00:01:44.829> concept

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:45.310 
handles here it's a new handle concept

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:47.699 
handles here it's a new handle concept
you<00:01:45.520> have<00:01:45.549> one<00:01:46.090> on<00:01:46.270> the<00:01:46.689> top<00:01:46.929> here<00:01:47.169> one<00:01:47.409> of<00:01:47.590> the

00:01:47.699 --> 00:01:47.709 
you have one on the top here one of the

00:01:47.709 --> 00:01:50.159 
you have one on the top here one of the
bottom<00:01:48.069> and<00:01:48.249> one<00:01:48.399> of<00:01:48.549> the<00:01:48.729> side<00:01:48.969> and<00:01:49.329> therefore

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:50.169 
bottom and one of the side and therefore

00:01:50.169 --> 00:01:52.349 
bottom and one of the side and therefore
it's<00:01:50.349> very<00:01:50.439> easy<00:01:50.859> to<00:01:51.189> take<00:01:51.369> this<00:01:51.609> and<00:01:51.849> to<00:01:52.179> put

00:01:52.349 --> 00:01:52.359 
it's very easy to take this and to put

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:55.039 
it's very easy to take this and to put
it<00:01:52.479> on<00:01:52.630> in<00:01:52.749> high<00:01:52.929> pole<00:01:53.279> without<00:01:54.279> any<00:01:54.520> problem

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
it on in high pole without any problem

00:01:55.049 --> 00:02:01.700 
it on in high pole without any problem
that<00:01:56.049> you<00:01:56.200> have<00:01:56.380> okay<00:01:57.060> so<00:01:58.679> guys<00:01:59.679> you<00:02:00.520> see
