00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:19.980 
circuit system so that was like in 1976

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:22.580 
circuit system so that was like in 1976
but<00:01:20.550> I<00:01:21.000> still<00:01:21.420> have<00:01:21.690> that<00:01:21.900> that<00:01:22.140> I<00:01:22.170> was<00:01:22.440> the

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
first circuit winner it only took me

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.690 
first circuit winner it only took me
about<00:01:24.480> 35<00:01:25.020> or<00:01:25.230> more<00:01:25.500> years<00:01:26.010> to<00:01:26.340> do<00:01:26.490> it<00:01:26.520> the

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
about 35 or more years to do it the

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.550 
about 35 or more years to do it the
second<00:01:27.120> time

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
second time

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.210 
second time
so<00:01:29.400> with<00:01:29.670> careers<00:01:30.090> in<00:01:30.479> the<00:01:30.570> middle<00:01:30.960> I<00:01:31.229> married

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
so with careers in the middle I married

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.790 
so with careers in the middle I married
into<00:01:32.400> a<00:01:32.610> rodeo<00:01:33.090> family<00:01:33.420> my<00:01:33.750> husband's<00:01:34.260> family

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:34.800 
into a rodeo family my husband's family

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.969 
into a rodeo family my husband's family
rodeoed<00:01:35.520> very<00:01:36.510> actively<00:01:37.020> my<00:01:37.410> husband<00:01:37.800> was<00:01:37.950> a

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
rodeoed very actively my husband was a

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.660 
rodeoed very actively my husband was a
pulled<00:01:38.250> over<00:01:38.720> but<00:01:39.720> he<00:01:40.470> he<00:01:40.890> stopped<00:01:41.190> go<00:01:41.400> logging

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
pulled over but he he stopped go logging

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.749 
pulled over but he he stopped go logging
in<00:01:42.000> the<00:01:42.119> 80s<00:01:42.570> at<00:01:43.200> Salinas<00:01:43.800> actually<00:01:44.400> he<00:01:44.610> was

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
in the 80s at Salinas actually he was

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.969 
in the 80s at Salinas actually he was
doing<00:01:45.000> a<00:01:45.090> surgery<00:01:45.420> residency<00:01:45.930> in<00:01:46.290> California

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
doing a surgery residency in California

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.300 
doing a surgery residency in California
and<00:01:47.220> so<00:01:47.820> he<00:01:48.000> decided<00:01:48.360> that<00:01:48.830> being<00:01:49.830> an<00:01:49.979> equine

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
and so he decided that being an equine

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.969 
and so he decided that being an equine
surgeon<00:01:50.850> was<00:01:51.180> probably<00:01:51.900> more<00:01:52.080> profitable<00:01:52.710> for

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
surgeon was probably more profitable for

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.600 
surgeon was probably more profitable for
him<00:01:53.009> so<00:01:53.369> he<00:01:53.670> and<00:01:54.420> so<00:01:54.840> I<00:01:55.350> continued<00:01:56.130> to<00:01:56.250> rodeo

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
him so he and so I continued to rodeo
