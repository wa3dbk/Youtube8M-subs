00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.350 
as a beginner guitar player occurred
when<00:01:37.560> I<00:01:37.590> was<00:01:37.979> changing<00:01:38.189> my<00:01:38.430> strings<00:01:38.939> for<00:01:39.270> the

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
when I was changing my strings for the

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.410 
when I was changing my strings for the
first<00:01:39.570> time<00:01:39.840> so<00:01:40.560> I<00:01:40.590> really<00:01:41.070> had<00:01:41.220> no<00:01:41.250> idea<00:01:41.460> how

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
first time so I really had no idea how

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.149 
first time so I really had no idea how
to<00:01:42.450> take<00:01:42.780> the<00:01:42.930> strings<00:01:43.229> off<00:01:43.409> a<00:01:43.439> guitar<00:01:43.920> and

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
to take the strings off a guitar and

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.160 
to take the strings off a guitar and
somehow<00:01:44.790> i<00:01:44.939> ended<00:01:45.090> up<00:01:45.420> convincing<00:01:45.750> myself

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
somehow i ended up convincing myself

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.530 
somehow i ended up convincing myself
that<00:01:46.530> the<00:01:47.040> best<00:01:47.280> way<00:01:47.520> to<00:01:47.579> go<00:01:47.880> about<00:01:47.909> doing<00:01:48.390> this

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
that the best way to go about doing this

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.560 
that the best way to go about doing this
was<00:01:49.320> instead<00:01:50.130> of<00:01:50.340> tuning<00:01:50.700> the<00:01:50.939> strings<00:01:51.240> down

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
was instead of tuning the strings down

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.260 
was instead of tuning the strings down
all<00:01:52.079> the<00:01:52.560> way<00:01:52.680> until<00:01:53.040> you<00:01:53.549> know<00:01:53.640> you<00:01:53.700> could<00:01:53.970> you

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
all the way until you know you could you

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.420 
all the way until you know you could you
could<00:01:54.390> take<00:01:54.600> them<00:01:54.750> off<00:01:54.930> i<00:01:55.229> actually<00:01:55.860> tune<00:01:56.219> them

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
could take them off i actually tune them

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.660 
could take them off i actually tune them
up<00:01:56.610> until<00:01:56.909> they<00:01:57.329> broke<00:01:57.689> and<00:01:58.020> then<00:01:58.890> i<00:01:59.189> took<00:01:59.340> them

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
up until they broke and then i took them

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.389 
up until they broke and then i took them
off<00:01:59.820> so<00:02:00.600> i<00:02:00.630> tuned<00:02:00.990> each<00:02:01.259> individual<00:02:01.950> string

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
off so i tuned each individual string

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:05.060 
off so i tuned each individual string
high<00:02:03.180> enough<00:02:03.570> to<00:02:04.079> the<00:02:04.200> point<00:02:04.229> that<00:02:04.560> it<00:02:04.710> broke

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
high enough to the point that it broke

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.940 
high enough to the point that it broke
and<00:02:05.369> that's<00:02:06.180> how<00:02:06.360> i<00:02:06.420> got<00:02:06.509> them<00:02:06.869> off<00:02:07.020> and<00:02:07.290> that's

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
and that's how i got them off and that's

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.609 
and that's how i got them off and that's
one<00:02:08.160> thing<00:02:08.340> that<00:02:08.399> I<00:02:08.550> look<00:02:08.789> back<00:02:09.000> on

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 
one thing that I look back on

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:12.070 
one thing that I look back on
I just<00:02:09.920> kind<00:02:10.280> of<00:02:10.310> frown<00:02:10.909> it<00:02:11.120> myself<00:02:11.540> I<00:02:11.780> think

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
I just kind of frown it myself I think

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.680 
I just kind of frown it myself I think
why<00:02:12.470> the<00:02:12.530> heck<00:02:12.860> did<00:02:13.099> I<00:02:13.190> do<00:02:13.250> that<00:02:13.480> we<00:02:14.480> were<00:02:14.659> all

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 
why the heck did I do that we were all

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:16.600 
why the heck did I do that we were all
beginners<00:02:14.959> at<00:02:15.409> one<00:02:15.560> point<00:02:15.799> another<00:02:16.430> thing

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
beginners at one point another thing
