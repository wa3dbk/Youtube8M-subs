blessed<00:01:48.500> with<00:01:48.740> a<00:01:48.770> lot<00:01:49.250> of<00:01:49.310> talent<00:01:49.850> and<00:01:49.939> we<00:01:50.780> know

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:50.869 
blessed with a lot of talent and we know

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:52.330 
blessed with a lot of talent and we know
when<00:01:51.020> she<00:01:51.170> combines<00:01:51.530> that<00:01:51.770> with<00:01:51.829> her<00:01:52.130> work

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340 
when she combines that with her work

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.789 
when she combines that with her work
ethic<00:01:52.490> she<00:01:52.939> has<00:01:53.270> a<00:01:53.299> positive<00:01:53.539> attitude<00:01:53.899> family

ethic she has a positive attitude family

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:56.620 
ethic she has a positive attitude family
support<00:01:55.310> so<00:01:55.789> I<00:01:55.820> think<00:01:55.939> you<00:01:56.270> know<00:01:56.390> if<00:01:56.450> she

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630 
support so I think you know if she

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:58.690 
support so I think you know if she
continues<00:01:56.810> on<00:01:57.350> the<00:01:57.560> path<00:01:57.590> that<00:01:57.799> she's<00:01:58.009> on<00:01:58.369> and

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700 
continues on the path that she's on and

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.060 
continues on the path that she's on and
gets<00:01:59.299> it<00:01:59.420> done<00:01:59.509> in<00:01:59.689> the<00:01:59.780> classroom<00:01:59.899> also<00:02:00.380> sky's

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:01.070 
gets it done in the classroom also sky's

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:12.699 
gets it done in the classroom also sky's
the<00:02:01.100> limit<00:02:10.239> if<00:02:11.239> she<00:02:11.480> if<00:02:11.750> she<00:02:11.870> wants<00:02:12.110> to<00:02:12.170> play<00:02:12.530> at

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:12.709 
the limit if she if she wants to play at

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:13.960 
the limit if she if she wants to play at
the<00:02:12.800> highest<00:02:12.920> level<00:02:13.340> basketball<00:02:13.819> I

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
the highest level basketball I

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:15.820 
the highest level basketball I
definitely<00:02:14.239> think<00:02:14.480> she<00:02:14.690> can<00:02:14.870> do<00:02:14.989> that<00:02:15.200> if<00:02:15.650> she

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
definitely think she can do that if she

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:18.400 
definitely think she can do that if she
continues<00:02:16.040> to<00:02:16.370> work<00:02:16.640> hard<00:02:16.940> again<00:02:17.720> concentrate
