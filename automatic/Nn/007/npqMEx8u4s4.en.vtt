00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
E&amp;M or hem based enm she just happened

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.789 
E&amp;M or hem based enm she just happened
to<00:02:59.340> pick<00:02:59.549> a<00:02:59.730> level<00:03:00.090> three<00:03:00.359> code<00:03:00.599> based<00:03:01.410> on<00:03:01.650> the

00:03:01.789 --> 00:03:01.799 
to pick a level three code based on the

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:04.660 
to pick a level three code based on the
scenario<00:03:02.579> that<00:03:02.849> she<00:03:03.180> was<00:03:03.329> trying<00:03:03.540> to<00:03:03.690> code<00:03:03.900> and

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:04.670 
scenario that she was trying to code and

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:08.750 
scenario that she was trying to code and
then<00:03:05.670> modifier<00:03:06.120> 25<00:03:06.510> is<00:03:07.760> significant

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
then modifier 25 is significant

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.569 
then modifier 25 is significant
separately<00:03:09.510> identifiable<00:03:10.430> evaluation<00:03:11.430> and

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:11.579 
separately identifiable evaluation and

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:13.250 
separately identifiable evaluation and
management<00:03:11.700> service<00:03:12.480> by<00:03:12.629> the<00:03:12.690> same<00:03:12.989> physician

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
management service by the same physician

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:17.270 
management service by the same physician
so<00:03:14.160> this<00:03:14.849> comes<00:03:15.180> into<00:03:15.480> play<00:03:15.720> because<00:03:16.160> we<00:03:17.160> have

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
so this comes into play because we have

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:18.949 
so this comes into play because we have
to<00:03:17.400> almost<00:03:17.609> treat<00:03:17.879> a<00:03:17.910> preventive<00:03:18.480> medicine

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
to almost treat a preventive medicine

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:24.020 
to almost treat a preventive medicine
E&amp;M<00:03:19.379> code<00:03:19.709> as<00:03:20.010> a<00:03:20.879> non<00:03:21.090> E&amp;M<00:03:21.540> code<00:03:21.780> so<00:03:22.530> if<00:03:23.010> we<00:03:23.849> want

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
E&amp;M code as a non E&amp;M code so if we want

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:26.990 
E&amp;M code as a non E&amp;M code so if we want
to<00:03:24.090> code<00:03:24.299> that<00:03:24.540> in<00:03:24.840> addition<00:03:25.319> to<00:03:25.349> a<00:03:25.700> sick<00:03:26.700> code

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
to code that in addition to a sick code

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.780 
to code that in addition to a sick code
so<00:03:27.239> we've<00:03:27.329> got<00:03:27.450> a<00:03:27.480> well<00:03:27.720> code<00:03:27.959> in<00:03:28.109> a<00:03:28.200> sick<00:03:28.380> code

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:28.790 
so we've got a well code in a sick code

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:31.159 
so we've got a well code in a sick code
we're<00:03:29.790> going<00:03:29.910> to<00:03:29.970> need<00:03:30.090> to<00:03:30.180> put<00:03:30.329> that<00:03:30.480> 25<00:03:30.930> on

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:31.169 
we're going to need to put that 25 on

00:03:31.169 --> 00:03:33.949 
we're going to need to put that 25 on
now<00:03:32.069> this<00:03:32.280> is<00:03:32.459> this<00:03:32.910> is<00:03:33.090> my<00:03:33.269> rule<00:03:33.569> is<00:03:33.780> how<00:03:33.930> I

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 
now this is this is my rule is how I

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:37.129 
now this is this is my rule is how I
teach<00:03:34.290> it<00:03:34.620> in<00:03:34.709> class<00:03:34.739> I<00:03:35.669> say<00:03:36.599> I<00:03:36.840> think<00:03:37.049> I've

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:37.139 
teach it in class I say I think I've

00:03:37.139 --> 00:03:39.740 
teach it in class I say I think I've
typed<00:03:37.410> it<00:03:37.620> down<00:03:37.769> here<00:03:38.010> in<00:03:38.099> the<00:03:38.190> bottom<00:03:38.750> all

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
typed it down here in the bottom all

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:42.110 
typed it down here in the bottom all
right<00:03:39.870> remember<00:03:39.989> Laureen<00:03:40.620> says<00:03:40.980> you<00:03:41.790> can't
