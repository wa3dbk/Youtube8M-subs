00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:08.309
 Hello my name is Stas and this 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:10.349
 software company k and so i went to my 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.210
 partner and friend store 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:13.920
 and you stood where you can naturally 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.500
 view model data cause 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.900
 showcase play around test deals 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.119
 essentially the same thing as i see it 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.010
 with my own eyes and so on 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:28.500
 today is two models 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:32.880
 this is the beginning of 2013 mds 665 eldest 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:34.739
 the model here I have is the end of 2013 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.050
 in fact what was before the new year 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:40.950
 sleep we see the date of the presentation 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:44.059
 that was released this 294 th e same 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:46.829
 most this is our older model and so 

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:49.350
 natural and comparison choice go 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.420
 do not move naturally have for you, I 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.340
 unequivocally say it's worth going over 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.680
 that is, get out of this make sure 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.469
 not well and of course let's go see 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:01.440
 what they represent themselves and so here at 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:04.619
 us to the processor 2 7 gigahertz a and 7 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.659
 here we have 2 and 3 2 hertz too a 7 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.939
 the only thing here is a new architecture 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.130
 architecture haswell yes that is which 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:13.320
 produces more production for 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.850
 performance and also improved 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.930
 battery before you save 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:21.299
 much more time working here 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:24.240
 we have 16 gigabytes of RAM here 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:26.310
 I'm still there is something not hertz about cleanliness 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.780
 in the same way we go the same 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:33.450
 the difference in graphics cards here we go 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:34.770
 The minimum date is slim, this is intel hd 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.790
 4,000 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:42.360
 and also 2 looks the same ford gt 650 on 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:45.119
 just one gigabyte of memory here 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.540
 us goes through about oiled about it not 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.780
 knows 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:51.200
 on sort of like on tests and also because 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:54.899
 what is written on many sites 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:57.000
 manufacturers this intel hd 5000 to tus 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:58.430
 in fact, again such an increase you even 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.010
 internally and externally 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:04.160
 internal i embedded graphics as well 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:06.710
 2 it is the same force gt 750m 2 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:08.420
 gigabyte again the growth is just 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:09.920
 colossal if you need to render 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:12.140
 video also connect huge 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:15.140
 number of monitors via thunderbolt 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:17.750
 either hd may and here and do the work 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.670
 you some kind of graphics and so 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.590
 regards geekbench status what 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.120
 he gave us the results to draw 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:25.700
 attention that is the numbers in front of you 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.620
 as for the very minimum test 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:30.200
 stages of the integrated video card also this 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:32.989
 here's a gain processor equals yes 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.670
 I have about 100 points but he is what 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:37.820
 concerns full performance 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:39.830
 it's about 600 points what's the most 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:41.600
 interesting that two of Odessa is very difficult 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:45.440
 dial if you will upgrade 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:47.000
 some just your own your tag 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.489
 yes that is which you have for example 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.959
 goes m d 103 and so on that is not 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:53.600
 it is important what memory you 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:55.430
 get and no matter what psd put 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:58.790
 in any case, here it is all already 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:00.950
 preinstalled much better and so 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:02.209
 I can tell examples on the processor 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:04.580
 definitely have 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:06.799
 the gain on the video card is definitely 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:09.019
 naturally we get it we 

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:11.030
 there are identical retina display voids 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:14.330
 which we have exactly iphone on and pads 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:16.549
 but on these mini we are waiting for him on the dance floor 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:18.950
 displays gave that is either wife a and macs 

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:22.220
 in any case, I really want to 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:24.799
 I want performance on ssd disk 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:26.959
 also about 400 colossally 

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:30.350
 gigabit per second if checking it 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:32.930
 testing for reading if to check 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:35.269
 Read here about you comes up 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:37.459
 800a megabits per second it's on 

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:39.049
 Today, the steepest rate 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:41.420
 naturally the system will be produced 

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:43.610
 even faster the program will naturally 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:45.950
 run even faster especially if you 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:48.200
 working with video rendering and you 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:50.030
 some huge gigabyte files 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:52.489
 It's clear that the launch will be just 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:55.480
 tremendously both there and there with you and me 

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:57.890
 are speakers that is, they are the same dynamics as well 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:00.560
 also the microphone is here in this 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:02.480
 parts if anyone knows without problems it 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:04.849
 just even here that you swipe 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:06.920
 you will see if you work with some 

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:07.450
 audio programs like you will immediately 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:10.430
 cola 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:12.319
 twitch to tus increase by 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:14.660
 battery honestly not working order 

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:16.729
 seven o'clock if you clean the system 

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:18.919
 that is, here comes the mold 

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:20.209
 the mavericks is already online here and yes 

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:21.560
 and naturally you can come here too 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:23.690
 put mom rick too slightly 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:26.540
 increase productivity but in any 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:28.729
 In case the indicator will remain the same 

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:32.660
 can this indicators in essence and iron 

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:35.290
 that is why if you are not a senior model and 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:39.590
 beginning of 2013 I recommend to move to 

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:42.250
 end 2013 because if for you 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:44.540
 this and but at least May 10 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:47.270
 you want on performance and 

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:50.090
 increase either higher in time something 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:51.740
 save and so on, but is it worth 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:54.200
 just buy if you haven't 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:55.970
 Macbook owners dataset calculate on 

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:58.669
 old models definitely worth 

00:04:55.970 --> 00:05:00.620
 really really cool model here i am 

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:04.550
 I think I'll be next year too 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:05.840
 don't go over here so we'll see 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:08.660
 how it will catch fire by 

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:10.220
 performance is cool on video 

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:12.020
 really everything is very cool at 

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:15.110
 buying by the way if you want something 

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:18.020
 check on the chart it is desirable 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:19.610
 put a black picture here and of course 

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:22.910
 same check pixel if you can 

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:25.100
 go to the store stork will tell you everything 

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:27.289
 tell demonstrate this all 

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:28.760
 see with your own eyes and with you 

00:05:27.289 --> 00:05:30.139
 was stas subscribe to our channel 

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:32.450
 put likes leave your 

00:05:30.139 --> 00:05:34.550
 performance comments here 

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:36.950
 any questions without any problems 

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:38.479
 also go to the site and style . 

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:40.249
 and where you too can view and 

00:05:38.479 --> 00:05:42.769
 I can choose prices for data 

00:05:40.249 --> 00:05:43.939
 hands here come to the store to see it 

00:05:42.769 --> 00:05:46.909
 with my own eyes 

00:05:43.939 --> 00:05:49.269
 thank you for being with us today and before
