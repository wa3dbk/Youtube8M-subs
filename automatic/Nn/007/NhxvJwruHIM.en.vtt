00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:07.640
 and 

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:14.520
 Hello, all guys, this is the cat 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:18.120
 of gannan and in this video I wanted 

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:20.670
 tell you a little about hedgehogs in this 

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:22.830
 good case are African signs and 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.040
 I wanted to tell a little of that 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.610
 toys or what little things can you 

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:28.770
 entertain 

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:31.860
 well here you see a roll of paper 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:34.530
 completely normal hygienic that 

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:37.770
 I really like to take and put 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:41.100
 little head and the truth is that it is one thing 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:44.520
 that all hedgehogs like any 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:47.670
 type of tunnel 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:51.510
 of yesterday's booth they will love are 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:54.710
 animals that love to hide 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:57.840
 you also know that they are nocturnal then 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:01:00.210
 if they have many tunnels 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.460
 burrows are worth they are going to 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.129
 thank you because it's what's best for you 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.890
 like what you can also put them 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:10.410
 are bridges worth of for example from 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:13.800
 wood that can both go under 

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:15.660
 how to go over to that 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:18.900
 locality also sure they like 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:21.090
 any type of tunnel and other 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:24.780
 then you can also put some type 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:26.850
 of trunk or wood or something by the 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.580
 style to remember that these animals 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:32.720
 they can in their nature as they walk 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:35.420
 let's say by the field then they have 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:39.390
 stones have different types of 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:41.159
 natural objects that you can good 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.039
 use 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:47.009
 and although maybe the cage or whatever 

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:50.399
 you can have a playground 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:53.299
 where yes they have more toys 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:56.459
 for a little bit to entertain them not 

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:59.969
 it can also be that some then play 

00:01:56.459 --> 00:02:03.690
 with a small stuffed toy or with some 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:06.990
 type of toy as 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:09.570
 of esparto good I do not remember very well 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:12.020
 what is that material called but toys 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:13.940
 that are light 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:16.820
 and that they can move like the 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:19.750
 cardboard tube that is something light that 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:22.790
 they can move easily worth it 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:25.280
 you may like the question 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:28.400
 it's also trying because you never know 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:30.590
 the same to an animal loves a 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:33.910
 object and another does not even case 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:36.500
 So the question is to try and then 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:39.380
 you can put them 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:41.540
 and also different types of substrate 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:45.830
 so that they for example like them 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:47.960
 I love to dig for those who love them 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:50.210
 like to dig then you can put them 

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:54.220
 an area of land 

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:57.490
 or from time to time they have access to 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:03:01.510
 to a place where there is land so that 

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:03.220
 dig and burrow and this will 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:05.830
 love because they like to be made 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:08.700
 your own little house and you will love them 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:13.540
 so then I more than anything else 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:16.660
 maybe toys would provide them 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:19.570
 different natural environments so that 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:22.960
 they could exercise and they 

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:25.870
 they could run, they could dig 

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:29.380
 because they like it a lot and then good 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:32.070
 already like this always because according to each each 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:35.200
 animal the same there is one that loves 

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:39.430
 I do not know how to lie on a blanket and 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:42.580
 another who hates it not then naught 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:45.400
 it's the usual thing to try things you can 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:48.130
 try things from gates things that 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:49.900
 weigh little that they can that they 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:51.790
 can move easily without any type 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:54.100
 of problem but mostly focused 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:56.660
 much in burrows booths you can go 

00:03:54.100 --> 00:04:01.660
 changing the 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:06.280
 different wooden cabins 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:10.230
 padded that are bigger more 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:14.020
 small or have a higher floor 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:16.840
 because it is accessed by a bridge I know 

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:20.410
 to vary and have different things 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:23.910
 because always be with exactly what 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:26.690
 same for them it is a little 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:29.150
 boring and what about him 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:30.980
 the cardboard tube you see that he likes 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:34.370
 always use a lot because they do 

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:36.639
 like to get inside and use it 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:38.849
 a lot so 

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:42.520
 and you feel it has enough that you can 

00:04:38.849 --> 00:04:44.050
 use it without fear because although 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:46.030
 they bite or whatever it is not going to happen to them 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:47.970
 absolutely nothing 

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:50.950
 then you can put them inside the 

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:54.320
 you can put him on or so that 

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:55.640
 snow goes down so they feel 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:59.560
 as well so they can do 

00:04:55.640 --> 00:05:01.850
 let's say attached to a bed that always 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:04.760
 they will be more comfortable than if not 

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:06.760
 they have absolutely nothing and good is 

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:10.720
 improvise you know that they also like 

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:13.970
 the water with or true to a certain extent 

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:16.280
 so if in a place when I let them go 

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:18.530
 and they have 

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:21.110
 a container with a little water 

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:22.860
 Well, if you want to get a little 

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:25.979
 all in summer 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:28.050
 Surely it could be that 

00:05:25.979 --> 00:05:30.599
 use although regardless of 

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:34.050
 that we bathe them, we do not bathe 

00:05:30.599 --> 00:05:35.729
 can put so that something also enters 

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:39.090
 what entertains them is the variety of 

00:05:35.729 --> 00:05:42.389
 food what they do not eat I always think 

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:43.889
 eat but we give them variety already in 

00:05:42.389 --> 00:05:46.770
 a video was already talking about the 

00:05:43.889 --> 00:05:49.080
 feeding the hedgehogs then that 

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:51.349
 have that a variety of foods 

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:53.219
 so that it is also a little bit more 

00:05:51.349 --> 00:05:56.550
 entertaining that always eat the same 

00:05:53.219 --> 00:06:00.710
 it's pretty boring and then in the 

00:05:56.550 --> 00:06:04.110
 game with another other orizo you can 

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:07.320
 mean a release of stress 

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:10.260
 who can live alone in general are 

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:12.540
 animals that do not live do not live in 

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:15.840
 communes but they can live 

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:18.150
 perfectly with others of its kind 

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:20.610
 without any problem and good 

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:23.820
 when giving company also interact 

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:25.440
 This will make the animals 

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:27.180
 Existing be more sociable and 

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:28.830
 entertain a little 

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:32.190
 in addition so that they move also more 

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:36.060
 cons more little things more fun have 

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:39.360
 they will move more and we will avoid a little 

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:43.590
 the obesity to which they have these 

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:45.570
 animals that are not very active by 

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:48.930
 nights when they get their biggest 

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:51.860
 activity so we can release them in 

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:56.000
 a room or leave 

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:59.569
 during the night they have a zone of 

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:03.650
 the game room with access to your 

00:06:59.569 --> 00:07:06.020
 little house or something like that or so 

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:09.469
 less during the day also be able to 

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:12.110
 get them out to walk and play 

00:07:09.469 --> 00:07:16.210
 a little not so well then more or 

00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:16.210
 except this is what I wanted to comment 

00:07:16.759 --> 00:07:23.550
 6 a little bit and you are going to try things 

00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:27.090
 have different different toys 

00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:29.910
 and with the booths and the tunnels 

00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:33.120
 I spared Jce because it is something that 

00:07:29.910 --> 00:07:35.520
 you will like it for sure, it is worth nothing 

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:37.830
 Well I leave you here with both the 

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:41.690
 image of the two pinchos these and us 

00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:41.690
 we see in the next video see you later
