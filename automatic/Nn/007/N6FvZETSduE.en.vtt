00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.130 
itself is very flowing very beautiful so
I<00:01:55.490> tried<00:01:56.490> to<00:01:56.670> incorporate<00:01:56.939> text<00:01:57.659> in<00:01:57.780> my<00:01:57.930> work

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
I tried to incorporate text in my work

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.950 
I tried to incorporate text in my work
as<00:01:58.320> well<00:01:58.500> and<00:01:58.740> that<00:01:58.979> does<00:01:59.759> reflect<00:02:00.540> lace

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
as well and that does reflect lace

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.609 
as well and that does reflect lace
somewhat<00:02:01.939> now<00:02:02.939> going<00:02:03.450> back<00:02:03.570> to<00:02:03.930> the<00:02:04.049> idea<00:02:04.409> of

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
somewhat now going back to the idea of

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.039 
somewhat now going back to the idea of
Irish<00:02:05.009> lace<00:02:05.280> I<00:02:05.579> felt<00:02:06.390> it<00:02:06.540> would<00:02:06.630> have<00:02:06.869> to<00:02:07.020> be

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
Irish lace I felt it would have to be

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:10.369 
Irish lace I felt it would have to be
white<00:02:07.350> on<00:02:07.560> white<00:02:07.590> so<00:02:08.580> I<00:02:08.610> printed<00:02:09.330> the<00:02:09.629> work<00:02:09.840> in

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
white on white so I printed the work in

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:13.420 
white on white so I printed the work in
white<00:02:10.979> ink<00:02:11.459> on<00:02:11.730> a<00:02:12.300> white

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
white ink on a white

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:19.000 
white ink on a white
muslin<00:02:14.150> and<00:02:15.250> to<00:02:16.329> basically<00:02:17.530> emphasize<00:02:18.530> his

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
muslin and to basically emphasize his

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.809 
muslin and to basically emphasize his
script<00:02:19.430> I<00:02:19.700> then<00:02:20.150> used<00:02:20.629> hand<00:02:21.590> embroidery<00:02:22.250> so

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:22.819 
script I then used hand embroidery so

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:25.030 
script I then used hand embroidery so
you<00:02:22.879> would<00:02:23.180> have<00:02:23.209> a<00:02:23.629> curly<00:02:23.989> em<00:02:24.319> I<00:02:24.650> would

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
you would have a curly em I would

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.759 
you would have a curly em I would
continue<00:02:25.519> the<00:02:25.670> curly<00:02:26.060> em<00:02:26.239> in<00:02:26.510> hand<00:02:27.019> embroidery

00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:27.769 
continue the curly em in hand embroidery

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:30.699 
continue the curly em in hand embroidery
okay<00:02:28.730> or<00:02:28.939> maybe<00:02:29.299> where<00:02:29.599> he'd<00:02:29.810> have<00:02:30.049> the<00:02:30.409> little

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:30.709 
okay or maybe where he'd have the little

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:32.860 
okay or maybe where he'd have the little
pie<00:02:30.980> signs<00:02:31.489> I'd<00:02:31.790> continue<00:02:32.209> the<00:02:32.329> pie<00:02:32.510> signs

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
pie signs I'd continue the pie signs

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:37.030 
pie signs I'd continue the pie signs
okay<00:02:33.650> and<00:02:33.889> also<00:02:34.549> there<00:02:35.540> for<00:02:35.840> three<00:02:36.230> dots<00:02:36.469> maybe

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
okay and also there for three dots maybe

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.339 
okay and also there for three dots maybe
French<00:02:37.310> nuts<00:02:37.639> would<00:02:38.329> fall<00:02:38.659> out<00:02:38.689> away<00:02:39.319> from

00:02:39.339 --> 00:02:39.349 
French nuts would fall out away from

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:43.690 
French nuts would fall out away from
that<00:02:39.739> so<00:02:40.489> also<00:02:41.269> um<00:02:41.510> he<00:02:42.349> pioneered<00:02:42.920> of<00:02:43.400> course

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
that so also um he pioneered of course

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:46.929 
that so also um he pioneered of course
he's<00:02:44.000> holed<00:02:44.269> boolean<00:02:44.810> logic<00:02:44.959> and<00:02:45.549> which<00:02:46.549> which

00:02:46.929 --> 00:02:46.939 
he's holed boolean logic and which which

00:02:46.939 --> 00:02:49.330 
he's holed boolean logic and which which
nowadays<00:02:47.269> is<00:02:47.870> used<00:02:48.349> in<00:02:48.650> every<00:02:49.129> single

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
nowadays is used in every single

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:51.429 
nowadays is used in every single
electronic<00:02:49.939> device<00:02:50.359> that<00:02:50.599> we<00:02:50.720> have<00:02:50.959> I<00:02:51.139> mean<00:02:51.169> he

00:02:51.429 --> 00:02:51.439 
electronic device that we have I mean he

00:02:51.439 --> 00:02:53.830 
electronic device that we have I mean he
was<00:02:51.530> quite<00:02:51.769> amazing<00:02:52.099> really<00:02:52.519> his<00:02:52.879> his<00:02:53.239> legacy

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
was quite amazing really his his legacy

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.390 
was quite amazing really his his legacy
is<00:02:54.400> uncredible<00:02:55.400> you<00:02:55.879> know<00:02:56.030> and<00:02:56.769> what<00:02:57.769> I<00:02:57.950> wanted

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
is uncredible you know and what I wanted

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.339 
is uncredible you know and what I wanted
to<00:02:58.459> do<00:02:58.700> was<00:02:59.000> was<00:02:59.299> look<00:02:59.569> at<00:02:59.719> of<00:02:59.870> course<00:03:00.109> the<00:03:00.319> the

00:03:00.339 --> 00:03:00.349 
to do was was look at of course the the

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:03.780 
to do was was look at of course the the
the<00:03:01.189> zeros<00:03:01.519> and<00:03:01.669> ones<00:03:01.819> from<00:03:02.480> binary<00:03:02.750> notation

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
the zeros and ones from binary notation

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:07.449 
the zeros and ones from binary notation
it<00:03:04.790> was<00:03:05.120> straight<00:03:05.450> away<00:03:05.719> for<00:03:06.049> malaise<00:03:06.430> so<00:03:07.430> I

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:07.459 
it was straight away for malaise so I

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:09.550 
it was straight away for malaise so I
wanted<00:03:08.000> to<00:03:08.209> have<00:03:08.689> the<00:03:08.959> zeros<00:03:09.260> and<00:03:09.439> ones

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560 
wanted to have the zeros and ones

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.849 
wanted to have the zeros and ones
emanating<00:03:10.219> from<00:03:10.430> these<00:03:10.579> equations<00:03:10.819> so<00:03:11.719> I<00:03:12.019> I

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:12.859 
emanating from these equations so I I

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:16.149 
emanating from these equations so I I
have<00:03:13.250> two<00:03:13.669> layers<00:03:13.969> of<00:03:14.269> of<00:03:14.480> silk<00:03:14.959> one<00:03:15.709> printed

00:03:16.149 --> 00:03:16.159 
have two layers of of silk one printed

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:18.969 
have two layers of of silk one printed
with<00:03:16.310> zeros<00:03:16.730> and<00:03:16.909> ones<00:03:17.030> now<00:03:17.359> this<00:03:17.569> is<00:03:17.979> they're

00:03:18.969 --> 00:03:18.979 
with zeros and ones now this is they're

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:20.860 
with zeros and ones now this is they're
not<00:03:19.129> random<00:03:19.370> actually<00:03:20.030> i<00:03:20.060> used<00:03:20.389> the<00:03:20.510> binary

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:20.870 
not random actually i used the binary

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:23.800 
not random actually i used the binary
notation<00:03:21.019> for<00:03:21.500> 1849<00:03:22.430> when<00:03:22.780> queen<00:03:23.780> victoria

notation for 1849 when queen victoria

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:26.740 
notation for 1849 when queen victoria
came<00:03:24.620> to<00:03:24.859> UCC<00:03:25.370> i<00:03:25.549> believe<00:03:26.120> for<00:03:26.299> the<00:03:26.329> first<00:03:26.569> time

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
came to UCC i believe for the first time

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:30.250 
came to UCC i believe for the first time
and<00:03:27.370> 2011<00:03:28.370> when<00:03:28.519> and<00:03:28.849> of<00:03:29.540> course<00:03:29.810> quinlisk

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:30.260 
and 2011 when and of course quinlisk

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.219 
and 2011 when and of course quinlisk
will<00:03:30.560> be<00:03:30.680> here<00:03:30.889> so<00:03:31.159> you<00:03:32.090> know<00:03:32.209> that's<00:03:32.810> there

00:03:33.219 --> 00:03:33.229 
will be here so you know that's there

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:35.500 
will be here so you know that's there
but<00:03:33.620> you<00:03:33.799> can<00:03:33.979> see<00:03:34.250> that<00:03:34.280> through<00:03:34.970> the

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:35.510 
but you can see that through the

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:38.229 
but you can see that through the
equations<00:03:36.319> and<00:03:36.500> then<00:03:36.979> I<00:03:37.189> further<00:03:37.609> embellished

00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:38.239 
equations and then I further embellished

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:41.110 
equations and then I further embellished
that<00:03:38.449> with<00:03:38.659> zeros<00:03:39.409> and<00:03:39.709> ones<00:03:39.979> almost<00:03:40.459> coming

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.120 
that with zeros and ones almost coming

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.119 
that with zeros and ones almost coming
out<00:03:41.359> from<00:03:41.659> the<00:03:41.780> scarf<00:03:42.109> and<00:03:42.259> falling<00:03:42.769> from<00:03:42.979> the

00:03:43.119 --> 00:03:43.129 
out from the scarf and falling from the

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:45.640 
out from the scarf and falling from the
scarf<00:03:43.430> as<00:03:43.609> a<00:03:43.669> lace<00:03:44.060> and<00:03:44.329> that<00:03:44.870> lace<00:03:45.139> was<00:03:45.409> made

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:45.650 
scarf as a lace and that lace was made

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:49.990 
scarf as a lace and that lace was made
on<00:03:45.919> the<00:03:46.549> machine<00:03:46.909> and<00:03:47.199> it<00:03:48.310> is<00:03:49.310> made<00:03:49.579> on<00:03:49.759> what's

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.000 
on the machine and it is made on what's

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.969 
on the machine and it is made on what's
called<00:03:50.209> a<00:03:50.329> soluble<00:03:50.780> fabric<00:03:51.169> so<00:03:51.439> you<00:03:51.500> make<00:03:51.769> here

00:03:51.969 --> 00:03:51.979 
called a soluble fabric so you make here

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:54.219 
called a soluble fabric so you make here
your<00:03:52.280> zeros<00:03:52.699> basically<00:03:53.359> wash<00:03:53.780> it<00:03:53.959> onto<00:03:54.169> the

00:03:54.219 --> 00:03:54.229 
your zeros basically wash it onto the

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:56.649 
your zeros basically wash it onto the
tap<00:03:54.500> and<00:03:54.709> you've<00:03:54.919> got<00:03:55.159> your<00:03:55.400> solid<00:03:55.819> 0<00:03:56.060> left<00:03:56.389> and

00:03:56.649 --> 00:03:56.659 
tap and you've got your solid 0 left and

00:03:56.659 --> 00:03:58.530 
tap and you've got your solid 0 left and
you<00:03:56.780> incorporate<00:03:57.470> that<00:03:57.620> back<00:03:57.889> into<00:03:58.189> the<00:03:58.310> lace

00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:58.540 
you incorporate that back into the lace

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:01.569 
you incorporate that back into the lace
now<00:03:59.540> I<00:03:59.569> also<00:03:59.959> felt<00:04:00.379> it<00:04:00.500> was<00:04:00.620> very<00:04:00.739> important<00:04:01.340> to

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:01.579 
now I also felt it was very important to

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:04.240 
now I also felt it was very important to
