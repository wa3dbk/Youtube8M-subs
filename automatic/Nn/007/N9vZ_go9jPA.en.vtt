him up and do stuff to him but like I'm

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.290 
him up and do stuff to him but like I'm
a<00:00:49.320> bomb<00:00:49.800> guy<00:00:50.129> like<00:00:50.340> he<00:00:50.489> has<00:00:50.579> bomb<00:00:50.820> powers<00:00:51.180> like

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
a bomb guy like he has bomb powers like

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.090 
a bomb guy like he has bomb powers like
he<00:00:51.360> can<00:00:51.510> explode<00:00:51.899> not<00:00:52.410> like<00:00:52.590> his<00:00:52.739> whole<00:00:52.890> body

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
he can explode not like his whole body

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.709 
he can explode not like his whole body
cuz<00:00:53.730> then<00:00:53.879> you<00:00:53.969> can<00:00:54.090> only<00:00:54.149> do<00:00:54.329> it<00:00:54.420> once<00:00:54.570> but

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
cuz then you can only do it once but

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:55.729 
cuz then you can only do it once but
like<00:00:54.809> different<00:00:55.050> parts<00:00:55.260> of<00:00:55.350> them<00:00:55.469> I<00:00:55.559> guess

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
like different parts of them I guess

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.410 
like different parts of them I guess
that<00:00:56.100> you'd<00:00:56.219> blow<00:00:56.579> up<00:00:56.730> and<00:00:56.910> then<00:00:57.000> grow<00:00:57.210> it<00:00:57.270> back

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
that you'd blow up and then grow it back

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.319 
that you'd blow up and then grow it back
it's<00:00:57.870> a<00:00:57.899> working<00:00:58.170> concept<00:00:59.090> we<00:01:00.090> gotta<00:01:00.239> make

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
it's a working concept we gotta make

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.090 
it's a working concept we gotta make
sure<00:01:00.510> his<00:01:00.629> shoulders<00:01:01.170> are<00:01:01.199> really<00:01:01.410> broad<00:01:01.739> and

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
sure his shoulders are really broad and

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.709 
sure his shoulders are really broad and
then<00:01:02.640> his<00:01:02.789> hips<00:01:02.969> have<00:01:03.120> got<00:01:03.239> to<00:01:03.359> be<00:01:03.420> smaller

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
then his hips have got to be smaller

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.600 
then his hips have got to be smaller
it's<00:01:03.989> super<00:01:04.229> strong<00:01:04.439> beef<00:01:04.710> pecks<00:01:05.010> sometimes

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
it's super strong beef pecks sometimes

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:06.950 
it's super strong beef pecks sometimes

the superheroes you can see in their

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.420 
the superheroes you can see in their
costumes<00:01:07.110> they<00:01:07.439> have<00:01:07.560> nipples<00:01:07.920> so<00:01:08.130> we'll<00:01:08.280> just

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
costumes they have nipples so we'll just

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:09.710 
costumes they have nipples so we'll just
do<00:01:08.549> a<00:01:08.580> couple<00:01:08.760> of<00:01:08.970> those<00:01:09.150> gonna<00:01:09.420> make<00:01:09.570> sure<00:01:09.659> he

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
do a couple of those gonna make sure he

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.390 
do a couple of those gonna make sure he
has<00:01:09.840> lots<00:01:10.049> of<00:01:10.140> ABS<00:01:10.320> so<00:01:10.619> these<00:01:10.770> real<00:01:11.010> tough<00:01:11.250> I

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
has lots of ABS so these real tough I

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.630 
has lots of ABS so these real tough I
think<00:01:11.580> I<00:01:11.640> say<00:01:11.820> well<00:01:12.030> maybe<00:01:12.180> an<00:01:12.330> eight-pack<00:01:12.720> way

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:13.640 
think I say well maybe an eight-pack way

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.700 
think I say well maybe an eight-pack way
super<00:01:14.640> oh<00:01:14.700> so<00:01:14.850> I<00:01:14.909> guess<00:01:15.060> we<00:01:15.210> can<00:01:15.330> just<00:01:15.500> do<00:01:16.500> more

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
super oh so I guess we can just do more

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.260 
super oh so I guess we can just do more
of<00:01:16.770> them<00:01:16.979> to<00:01:17.220> make<00:01:17.340> sure<00:01:17.520> that<00:01:17.640> he's<00:01:17.820> as<00:01:17.970> strong

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
of them to make sure that he's as strong

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.539 
of them to make sure that he's as strong
as<00:01:18.390> possible<00:01:18.570> really<00:01:19.170> bulging<00:01:19.710> biceps<00:01:19.860> I

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
as possible really bulging biceps I

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.700 
as possible really bulging biceps I
think<00:01:20.939> my<00:01:21.060> cat<00:01:21.299> just<00:01:21.600> sneezed<00:01:21.869> like<00:01:22.259> during

there<00:01:46.409> instead<00:01:46.799> of<00:01:46.860> a<00:01:46.979> spring<00:01:47.250> we'll<00:01:47.399> just

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
there instead of a spring we'll just

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:48.800 
there instead of a spring we'll just
make<00:01:47.700> his<00:01:47.880> foot<00:01:48.090> stuck<00:01:48.299> in<00:01:48.360> a<00:01:48.509> big<00:01:48.659> rubber

bouncing ball so that he can jump with
that<00:01:50.520> so<00:01:50.759> when<00:01:50.909> is<00:01:51.060> the<00:01:51.180> spring<00:01:51.450> and<00:01:51.570> the

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
that so when is the spring and the

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:52.999 
that so when is the spring and the
others<00:01:51.810> the<00:01:51.960> ball<00:01:52.110> how<00:01:52.350> about<00:01:52.500> a<00:01:52.530> set<00:01:52.799> of<00:01:52.829> the

others the ball how about a set of the

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.100 
others the ball how about a set of the
left<00:01:53.189> arm<00:01:53.430> we<00:01:53.610> just<00:01:53.820> do<00:01:54.000> like<00:01:54.030> a<00:01:54.210> big<00:01:54.840> stick<00:01:55.079> of

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
left arm we just do like a big stick of

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.740 
left arm we just do like a big stick of
diamonite<00:01:55.619> it's<00:01:56.399> gonna<00:01:56.549> blow<00:01:56.939> up<00:01:56.969> and<00:01:57.329> spark

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
diamonite it's gonna blow up and spark

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.240 
diamonite it's gonna blow up and spark
and<00:01:57.960> kill<00:01:58.140> all<00:01:58.229> the<00:01:58.380> bad<00:01:58.500> guys<00:01:58.530> he's<00:01:59.130> gonna

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
and kill all the bad guys he's gonna

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.100 
and kill all the bad guys he's gonna
save<00:01:59.610> the<00:01:59.820> city<00:02:00.060> of<00:02:00.210> new<00:02:00.360> tropi<00:02:00.719> list<00:02:00.990> you

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
save the city of new tropi list you

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:02.359 
save the city of new tropi list you
gotta<00:02:01.290> make<00:02:01.409> the<00:02:01.560> eye<00:02:01.590> as<00:02:01.710> good<00:02:02.070> and<00:02:02.280> his

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
gotta make the eye as good and his

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:03.920 
gotta make the eye as good and his
detail<00:02:02.759> and<00:02:02.939> realistic<00:02:03.360> as<00:02:03.450> possible<00:02:03.479> because

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
detail and realistic as possible because

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.480 
detail and realistic as possible because
that's<00:02:04.170> like<00:02:04.409> the<00:02:04.530> gateway<00:02:04.860> to<00:02:04.890> the<00:02:05.130> human

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
that's like the gateway to the human

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:06.830 
that's like the gateway to the human
soul<00:02:05.729> but<00:02:05.939> then<00:02:06.060> the<00:02:06.149> trick<00:02:06.390> is<00:02:06.509> making<00:02:06.689> the

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
soul but then the trick is making the

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.330 
soul but then the trick is making the
other<00:02:06.960> one<00:02:07.140> look<00:02:07.320> just<00:02:07.590> as<00:02:07.740> good<00:02:07.920> and<00:02:08.129> on<00:02:08.220> the

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
other one look just as good and on the

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:09.680 
other one look just as good and on the
same<00:02:08.550> plane<00:02:08.819> so<00:02:08.849> that<00:02:09.149> everything<00:02:09.479> is<00:02:09.509> equal

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
same plane so that everything is equal

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.150 
same plane so that everything is equal
and<00:02:09.989> it<00:02:10.050> doesn't<00:02:10.319> look<00:02:10.379> totally<00:02:10.619> weird<00:02:11.009> like

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
and it doesn't look totally weird like

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.740 
and it doesn't look totally weird like
he's<00:02:11.280> messed<00:02:11.520> up<00:02:11.700> and<00:02:12.000> I<00:02:12.239> always<00:02:12.540> no<00:02:12.599> matter

and then like some toothpicks and I go

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:48.800 
and then like some toothpicks and I go
botch<00:02:47.459> up<00:02:47.640> and<00:02:47.790> box<00:02:47.970> of<00:02:48.150> matchsticks<00:02:48.600> and

botch up and box of matchsticks and
that's<00:02:48.959> pretty<00:02:49.140> good<00:02:49.260> so<00:02:49.530> this<00:02:49.650> simple<00:02:49.950> could

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
that's pretty good so this simple could

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:54.259 
that's pretty good so this simple could
be<00:02:50.280> be<00:02:50.640> blow<00:02:51.209> up<00:02:51.239> guy<00:02:51.769> be<00:02:52.769> Yugi<00:02:53.220> but<00:02:53.670> I<00:02:53.970> guess

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:54.269 
be be blow up guy be Yugi but I guess

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:56.240 
be be blow up guy be Yugi but I guess
I'll<00:02:54.450> see<00:02:54.630> Bruno's<00:02:54.989> they<00:02:55.650> usually<00:02:55.800> end<00:02:56.190> with

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
I'll see Bruno's they usually end with

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.970 
I'll see Bruno's they usually end with
man<00:02:56.580> so<00:02:56.910> let's<00:02:57.840> just<00:02:57.989> say<00:02:58.080> blow-up<00:02:58.350> guy<00:02:58.500> man<00:02:58.709> so

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
man so let's just say blow-up guy man so

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:04.640 
man so let's just say blow-up guy man so
then<00:02:59.970> it<00:03:00.060> says<00:03:00.239> bug<00:03:00.510> man<00:03:01.250> cap<00:03:02.250> I<00:03:03.470> guess<00:03:04.470> we'll

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
then it says bug man cap I guess we'll

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.110 
then it says bug man cap I guess we'll
just<00:03:04.680> give<00:03:04.890> him<00:03:04.980> some<00:03:05.190> in<00:03:05.310> a<00:03:05.340> second<00:03:05.640> that's

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
just give him some in a second that's

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.110 
just give him some in a second that's
fine<00:03:07.190> there<00:03:08.190> are<00:03:08.280> three<00:03:08.430> types<00:03:08.610> of<00:03:08.760> shading

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
fine there are three types of shading

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.180 
fine there are three types of shading
there's<00:03:09.360> hatching<00:03:10.050> which<00:03:10.200> is<00:03:10.350> like<00:03:10.560> lines<00:03:10.860> and

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
there's hatching which is like lines and

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:12.560 
there's hatching which is like lines and
then<00:03:11.430> there's<00:03:11.610> cross<00:03:11.850> hatching<00:03:12.300> which<00:03:12.450> is

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:12.570 
then there's cross hatching which is

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:14.750 
then there's cross hatching which is
like<00:03:12.750> this<00:03:12.930> where<00:03:13.140> you<00:03:13.230> cross<00:03:13.500> the<00:03:13.769> lines<00:03:14.010> over

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
like this where you cross the lines over

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:18.890 
like this where you cross the lines over
in<00:03:15.390> that<00:03:15.660> direction<00:03:15.840> so<00:03:17.750> then<00:03:18.750> there's

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
in that direction so then there's

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.229 
in that direction so then there's
sibling<00:03:19.320> to<00:03:20.190> add<00:03:20.310> up<00:03:20.519> in<00:03:20.640> it<00:03:20.760> that's<00:03:21.120> not

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:21.239 
sibling to add up in it that's not

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:22.550 
sibling to add up in it that's not
really<00:03:21.420> looking<00:03:21.660> good<00:03:21.780> but<00:03:21.959> then<00:03:22.079> and<00:03:22.290> the

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
really looking good but then and the

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.020 
really looking good but then and the
last<00:03:22.739> way<00:03:22.920> is<00:03:22.950> that<00:03:23.340> this<00:03:23.610> is<00:03:23.670> the<00:03:23.760> smooth

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
last way is that this is the smooth

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:25.970 
last way is that this is the smooth
smudgy<00:03:24.660> one<00:03:24.810> were<00:03:24.959> you<00:03:25.110> you<00:03:25.320> got<00:03:25.410> to<00:03:25.500> smudge<00:03:25.769> it

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
smudgy one were you you got to smudge it

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:28.190 
smudgy one were you you got to smudge it
I<00:03:26.130> didn't<00:03:26.910> it's<00:03:27.209> not<00:03:27.269> working<00:03:27.720> very<00:03:27.870> well<00:03:27.959> when
