00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:17.660
 good in today's tutorial we're going to 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:20.660
 record stephanie who is not invited on 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:24.410
 today and we will record a routine 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:27.490
 of base and we are going to do what it is to cover 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:32.200
 the areas where there are pimples and 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:32.200
 Cover certain areas with base 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:36.969
 first of all I'm going to apply first in 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:41.879
 the entire area of the face 

00:00:36.969 --> 00:00:41.879
 to cover the cuts you look still 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:06.640
 now I'm going to apply a little bit of base 

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:06.640
 tone of the whole area 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:12.729
 what I'm going to do is apply a base 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:16.000
 which is exactly the tone of stephanie 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:17.420
 and I'm going to apply it on the whole face this 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.830
 base is 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:24.759
 greater coverage then the colon goes 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:28.189
 to apply and it will look pretty 

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:29.780
 difference when applying what I'm 

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:31.790
 doing by applying it with your fingers 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:33.200
 because I'm doing a one way 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:36.659
 circular way 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:41.609
 in the areas where you had then 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:44.310
 I will apply more there and I will apply it 

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:47.640
 in a circular way to grow 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:50.220
 It is more adhere to the skin this base 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:53.520
 this cam where they go 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:55.230
 that will continue to apply to the skin 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:59.270
 therefore must be applied in a 

00:01:55.230 --> 00:02:00.900
 quick way but it also applies 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:03.240
 m 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:08.450
 in a precise way 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:08.450
 I will seal with powders all with the area 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:12.920
 this is to make sure that pure factor 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:16.940
 time the process that I'm using 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:20.330
 loose powders and for this moment and 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:22.580
 apply the concealer then by the 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:25.269
 shape of the face of stephanie I'm going to 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:28.549
 apply the blog from the ears to 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:30.640
 make your mouth to give you takes of form 

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:33.980
 to the face 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:36.210
 Then I'm going to make them 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:39.420
 with shadow 

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:41.440
 a lighter shade of her hair I'm going to 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:43.810
 make peace 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:46.420
 then what I'm going to what I want 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:49.020
 make them come to forals but they 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:52.350
 look a little bit darker since 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:56.610
 for their genetics that tend to be 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:03:00.540
 quite clear then leave them a 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:03.030
 little more pronounced they make you look 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:08.030
 a little more youth then 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:08.030
 what I'm going to do is do it 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:14.570
 Then I will apply 

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:17.890
 a brown shadow and I'll combine it 

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:20.000
 upwards so that it gets worse 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:23.720
 Y 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.310
 in the arch of the eyebrow is a color of 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:27.920
 skin tone of it so that it 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:29.960
 will blur then what I'm going to do is 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:33.670
 that with a black shadow I'm going to blur 

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:36.930
 well attached to the line of the 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:36.930
 of the three years 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:42.760
 so that you look like a delineator 

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:42.760
 blurred 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:48.610
 and in the bottom part also always 

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:49.959
 stuck to the lash line I'm going to 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:51.640
 blur a little bit of the black 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:54.310
 Then I'm just going to apply 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:58.590
 eyeliner but always quite thin 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:58.590
 to shape it and then just mask 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:21.310
 and good in today's tutorial 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:25.000
 we have guest stephanie and we are going to 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:27.160
 record a routine near the base of the 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.910
 makeup and knowing who is 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.910
 looking for help 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:33.260
 and what a bad 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:01.470
 Hello 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:09.009
 with people 

00:05:06.409 --> 00:05:09.009
 that's it 

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:20.560
