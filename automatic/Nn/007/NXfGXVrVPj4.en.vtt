switches work this is all controlled by

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:04.860 
switches work this is all controlled by
the<00:01:02.800> original<00:01:03.340> switches<00:01:04.090> on<00:01:04.300> the<00:01:04.420> console

the original switches on the console

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:08.520 
the original switches on the console
itself<00:01:05.430> I<00:01:06.450> normally<00:01:07.450> don't<00:01:07.630> even<00:01:07.990> run<00:01:08.170> a

to the Oregon only for maintenance

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:18.180 
to the Oregon only for maintenance
otherwise<00:01:13.690> it<00:01:13.960> runs<00:01:14.520> sustainable<00:01:15.750> just<00:01:16.750> I<00:01:17.200> can

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:18.190 
otherwise it runs sustainable just I can

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:19.920 
otherwise it runs sustainable just I can
see<00:01:18.580> if<00:01:18.670> I<00:01:18.760> get<00:01:18.940> it<00:01:19.030> to<00:01:19.120> play<00:01:19.330> something<00:01:19.600> real

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:19.930 
see if I get it to play something real

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:25.870 
see if I get it to play something real
quick

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:25.880 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:30.440 

yeah<00:01:26.880> Karen<00:01:27.659> walls<00:01:29.030> let's<00:01:30.030> put<00:01:30.240> absolutely

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
yeah Karen walls let's put absolutely

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:46.200 
yeah Karen walls let's put absolutely
views<00:01:32.299> and<00:01:33.299> some<00:01:33.659> boxing<00:01:34.049> yeah

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:46.210 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:50.430 

these<00:01:47.210> are<00:01:47.390> the<00:01:47.540> expression<00:01:48.350> pedals<00:01:48.770> the

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:50.440 
these are the expression pedals the

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:56.399 
these are the expression pedals the
switch<00:01:51.440> contacts<00:01:52.010> are<00:01:52.220> pretty<00:01:52.430> dirty<00:01:52.610> undies

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:56.409 

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:16.380 

anything<00:01:57.409> goes<00:01:57.680> desperately

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:29.540 

open<00:02:17.390> Diocletian<00:02:18.700> absolutes<00:02:20.590> tears

boxman<00:02:30.550> in<00:02:30.970> there

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:59.150 

let's<00:02:53.760> just<00:02:53.849> try

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:03.500 

you

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:14.510 

and<00:03:04.510> try<00:03:04.870> again<00:03:04.930> with<00:03:05.319> the<00:03:05.440> term<00:03:05.650> loans

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:14.520 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:17.880 

that's<00:03:15.520> just<00:03:15.700> to<00:03:15.880> demonstrate<00:03:16.030> the<00:03:16.890> virtually

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:17.890 
that's just to demonstrate the virtually

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:19.950 
that's just to demonstrate the virtually
unlimited<00:03:18.130> polyphony<00:03:19.120> that<00:03:19.390> you<00:03:19.480> get<00:03:19.660> out<00:03:19.810> of

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:19.960 
unlimited polyphony that you get out of

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:22.620 
unlimited polyphony that you get out of
the<00:03:20.220> keys<00:03:21.220> and<00:03:21.430> Benjamin<00:03:22.000> you<00:03:22.120> set<00:03:22.450> it<00:03:22.540> up

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:22.630 
the keys and Benjamin you set it up

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:27.690 
the keys and Benjamin you set it up
right<00:03:23.370> so<00:03:24.370> Emanuel<00:03:25.620> get<00:03:26.620> some<00:03:26.920> stops<00:03:27.160> this<00:03:27.520> is

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:27.700 
right so Emanuel get some stops this is

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:40.600 
right so Emanuel get some stops this is
a<00:03:27.730> needless<00:03:28.360> war

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:40.610 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:48.600 

quit

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:48.610 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:04:03.140 

to<00:03:49.610> us

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:07.080 

now<00:04:04.150> the<00:04:04.210> lower<00:04:04.450> keyword<00:04:05.700> decides<00:04:06.700> to<00:04:06.880> work

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:07.090 
now the lower keyword decides to work

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:12.450 
now the lower keyword decides to work
today<00:04:07.710> and<00:04:08.710> the<00:04:08.920> scent<00:04:09.190> of<00:04:09.250> screams<00:04:11.460> nine

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:12.460 
today and the scent of screams nine

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:25.219 
today and the scent of screams nine
pieces<00:04:12.760> in<00:04:13.060> texas<00:04:13.690> tech<00:04:14.110> foots

00:04:25.219 --> 00:04:25.229 

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:29.159 

much<00:04:26.229> sounds<00:04:26.590> like<00:04:26.740> the<00:04:26.860> old<00:04:27.070> naval<00:04:28.169> base

00:04:29.159 --> 00:04:29.169 
much sounds like the old naval base

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:38.180 
much sounds like the old naval base
metals<00:04:30.120> pretty<00:04:31.120> typical<00:04:31.360> saps

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:38.190 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:41.640 

that<00:04:39.190> I<00:04:39.760> thought<00:04:40.570> that<00:04:40.750> comes<00:04:40.960> to<00:04:41.080> the<00:04:41.320> camera

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:41.650 
that I thought that comes to the camera

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:48.670 
that I thought that comes to the camera
microphone<00:04:42.090> they<00:04:43.090> were<00:04:43.240> based<00:04:43.720> on

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:48.680 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:57.110 

symbols<00:04:52.669> now<00:04:53.669> I<00:04:53.699> can<00:04:54.180> also<00:04:54.330> couple<00:04:55.169> the<00:04:56.120> couple

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:57.120 
symbols now I can also couple the couple

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:16.920 
symbols now I can also couple the couple
of<00:04:57.210> the<00:04:57.300> other<00:04:57.510> granules<00:04:58.110> two<00:04:58.500> pedals

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:16.930 

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:23.540 

album<00:05:17.930> covers<00:05:18.830> two<00:05:19.010> tables

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:23.550 

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:30.500 

it's<00:05:24.550> pretty<00:05:24.789> much<00:05:24.940> suggest

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:30.510

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:27.870 
identical sound cards installed it'll

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:29.840 
identical sound cards installed it'll
work<00:06:28.200> but<00:06:28.680> when<00:06:29.010> you<00:06:29.100> change<00:06:29.370> the<00:06:29.490> settings

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:29.850 
work but when you change the settings

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:33.020 
work but when you change the settings
for<00:06:29.910> either<00:06:30.240> card<00:06:30.690> it<00:06:31.230> only<00:06:31.950> affects<00:06:32.490> the

primary<00:06:33.510> card<00:06:33.840> so<00:06:34.650> I<00:06:34.680> had<00:06:35.010> to<00:06:35.040> use<00:06:35.370> one<00:06:35.760> audigy

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:36.240

00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:49.070 
the software up but i think this

00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:52.750 
the software up but i think this
explains<00:07:49.580> the<00:07:49.910> majority<00:07:50.480> of<00:07:50.510> it
