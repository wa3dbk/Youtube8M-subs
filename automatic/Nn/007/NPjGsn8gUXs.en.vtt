00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
a moderate disability that has not ever

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.950 
a moderate disability that has not ever
worked<00:00:55.350> with<00:00:55.469> a<00:00:55.559> work<00:00:55.829> system<00:00:56.309> so<00:00:56.850> this<00:00:57.329> is<00:00:57.360> set

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
worked with a work system so this is set

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.200 
worked with a work system so this is set
up<00:00:58.109> for<00:00:58.140> independent<00:00:59.100> work<00:00:59.280> and<00:00:59.550> what<00:01:00.090> I've

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
up for independent work and what I've

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.389 
up for independent work and what I've
done<00:01:00.390> is<00:01:00.570> a<00:01:00.600> simple<00:01:01.079> left<00:01:01.410> to<00:01:01.770> right<00:01:02.010> work

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
done is a simple left to right work

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.670 
done is a simple left to right work
system<00:01:02.910> so<00:01:03.449> let's<00:01:03.660> see<00:01:03.840> if<00:01:03.960> it<00:01:04.049> answers<00:01:04.229> those

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
system so let's see if it answers those

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.340 
system so let's see if it answers those
four<00:01:04.979> questions<00:01:05.129> what<00:01:05.880> work<00:01:06.119> a<00:01:06.390> simple

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
four questions what work a simple

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.520 
four questions what work a simple
homemade<00:01:07.950> actually<00:01:08.700> put<00:01:09.060> in<00:01:09.240> task<00:01:09.570> how<00:01:10.260> much

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
homemade actually put in task how much

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.910 
homemade actually put in task how much
work<00:01:10.860> all<00:01:11.130> of<00:01:11.760> these<00:01:11.939> chips<00:01:12.330> goes<00:01:12.720> inside<00:01:13.229> how

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
work all of these chips goes inside how

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.340 
work all of these chips goes inside how
do<00:01:13.979> I<00:01:14.220> know<00:01:14.280> when<00:01:14.610> I've<00:01:14.760> done<00:01:14.970> it<00:01:15.270> goes<00:01:15.840> in<00:01:16.110> the

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
do I know when I've done it goes in the

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.010 
do I know when I've done it goes in the
finished<00:01:16.950> basket<00:01:17.460> and<00:01:17.610> what<00:01:18.060> comes<00:01:18.330> next<00:01:18.600> the

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
finished basket and what comes next the

if<00:01:25.439> this<00:01:25.619> is<00:01:25.799> set<00:01:25.979> up<00:01:26.189> as<00:01:26.369> an<00:01:26.490> independent<00:01:27.090> work

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
if this is set up as an independent work

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.149 
if this is set up as an independent work
system<00:01:27.659> you<00:01:28.110> just<00:01:28.530> want<00:01:28.710> the<00:01:28.799> child<00:01:29.040> to

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
system you just want the child to

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.950 
system you just want the child to
understand<00:01:29.729> that<00:01:29.880> when<00:01:30.000> they<00:01:30.150> sit<00:01:30.479> down<00:01:30.509> and

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
understand that when they sit down and

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.560 
understand that when they sit down and
this<00:01:31.530> work<00:01:31.770> system<00:01:32.220> is<00:01:32.340> presented<00:01:32.909> they<00:01:33.329> just

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
this work system is presented they just

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.010 
this work system is presented they just
need<00:01:33.750> to<00:01:33.930> do<00:01:34.110> a<00:01:34.320> task<00:01:34.590> if<00:01:35.250> you<00:01:35.670> if<00:01:36.509> you<00:01:36.720> know<00:01:36.869> the

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
need to do a task if you if you know the

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.170 
need to do a task if you if you know the
child<00:01:37.259> doesn't<00:01:37.470> has<00:01:38.159> never<00:01:38.340> seen<00:01:38.700> this<00:01:38.880> task

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
child doesn't has never seen this task

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.510 
child doesn't has never seen this task
and<00:01:39.570> make<00:01:39.720> sure<00:01:39.750> that<00:01:39.960> you<00:01:40.259> show<00:01:40.560> them<00:01:40.770> how<00:01:40.979> to

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
and make sure that you show them how to

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.580 
and make sure that you show them how to
do<00:01:41.670> it<00:01:41.790> in<00:01:41.909> direct<00:01:42.299> instruction<00:01:43.020> because<00:01:43.200> you

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
do it in direct instruction because you

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.679 
do it in direct instruction because you
never<00:01:43.799> want<00:01:44.100> to<00:01:44.159> put<00:01:44.250> anything<00:01:45.000> in<00:01:45.420> an

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
never want to put anything in an

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.690 
never want to put anything in an
independent<00:01:46.290> work<00:01:46.409> system<00:01:46.860> that<00:01:47.250> the<00:01:47.399> child

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
independent work system that the child

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.160 
independent work system that the child
cannot<00:01:48.149> complete<00:01:48.689> themselves<00:01:50.780> okay<00:01:51.780> so<00:01:51.840> now

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
cannot complete themselves okay so now

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.200 
cannot complete themselves okay so now
here<00:01:52.560> I've<00:01:52.770> set<00:01:53.070> up<00:01:53.100> a<00:01:53.340> work<00:01:53.520> system<00:01:53.880> that's<00:01:54.119> a

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
here I've set up a work system that's a

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.149 
here I've set up a work system that's a
little<00:01:54.659> more<00:01:54.810> sophisticated<00:01:55.500> than<00:01:55.649> the<00:01:55.890> first

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
little more sophisticated than the first

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.580 
little more sophisticated than the first
this<00:01:56.850> would<00:01:57.030> be<00:01:57.060> appropriate<00:01:57.479> for<00:01:57.810> let's<00:01:58.469> say

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
this would be appropriate for let's say

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.330 
this would be appropriate for let's say
a<00:01:58.710> beginning<00:01:59.390> elementary<00:02:00.390> child<00:02:00.659> that<00:02:00.899> has<00:02:01.079> a

a beginning elementary child that has a
moderate<00:02:02.340> disabilities<00:02:02.840> so<00:02:03.840> we're<00:02:04.229> still<00:02:04.439> not

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
moderate disabilities so we're still not

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.920 
moderate disabilities so we're still not
at<00:02:04.860> academics<00:02:05.820> but<00:02:06.180> we're<00:02:06.420> at<00:02:06.600> task

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
at academics but we're at task

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.249 
at academics but we're at task
completion<00:02:07.409> and<00:02:07.740> a

of the United States and then when

00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:08.729 
of the United States and then when
they're<00:04:07.030> finished<00:04:07.269> they<00:04:07.930> just<00:04:08.139> put<00:04:08.319> that<00:04:08.349> in

00:04:08.729 --> 00:04:08.739 
they're finished they just put that in

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:11.969 
they're finished they just put that in
the<00:04:09.129> finished<00:04:09.459> basket<00:04:10.060> and<00:04:10.599> so<00:04:11.260> on<00:04:11.500> so

00:04:11.969 --> 00:04:11.979 
the finished basket and so on so

00:04:11.979 --> 00:04:13.259 
the finished basket and so on so
basically<00:04:12.370> you<00:04:12.639> have<00:04:12.819> a<00:04:12.849> little<00:04:13.090> more

00:04:13.259 --> 00:04:13.269 
basically you have a little more

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:15.629 
basically you have a little more
sophisticated<00:04:13.959> work<00:04:14.680> system<00:04:15.190> for<00:04:15.489> those

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:15.639 
sophisticated work system for those

00:04:15.639 --> 00:04:16.840 
sophisticated work system for those
children<00:04:16.299> who<00:04:16.329> are<00:04:16.599> a<00:04:16.630> little

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:16.850 
children who are a little

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:18.640 
children who are a little
more<00:04:17.030> capable<00:04:17.540> of<00:04:17.959> doing<00:04:18.290> some<00:04:18.470> of<00:04:18.560> those

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:18.650 
more capable of doing some of those

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:20.860 
more capable of doing some of those
academic<00:04:19.310> things<00:04:19.550> but<00:04:20.180> yet<00:04:20.360> they<00:04:20.510> get<00:04:20.690> the

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:20.870 
academic things but yet they get the

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:23.770 
academic things but yet they get the
system<00:04:21.080> that<00:04:21.500> shows<00:04:22.280> them<00:04:22.550> what<00:04:23.000> work<00:04:23.270> how

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:23.780 
system that shows them what work how

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:25.690 
system that shows them what work how
much<00:04:23.960> work<00:04:24.230> how<00:04:24.830> do<00:04:24.890> I<00:04:25.010> know<00:04:25.130> when<00:04:25.370> I'm<00:04:25.490> done

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:25.700 
much work how do I know when I'm done

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:28.390 
much work how do I know when I'm done
and<00:04:25.940> what<00:04:26.540> comes<00:04:26.780> next<00:04:27.020> I<00:04:27.410> hope<00:04:28.220> these
