laptop for money $1400 you could
probably<00:06:48.589> get<00:06:48.829> a<00:06:48.860> little<00:06:49.009> cheaper<00:06:49.369> in<00:06:49.459> Amazon

00:06:49.869 --> 00:06:49.879 
probably get a little cheaper in Amazon

probably get a little cheaper in Amazon
for<00:06:50.059> maybe<00:06:50.209> I<00:06:50.749> would<00:06:50.930> say<00:06:51.050> 13<00:06:51.499> to<00:06:51.649> 1200

00:06:52.239 --> 00:06:52.249 
for maybe I would say 13 to 1200
