inches long I don't really know
yeah<00:01:44.850> probably<00:01:45.780> if<00:01:46.500> you<00:01:46.950> do<00:01:47.100> it<00:01:47.280> the<00:01:47.460> way<00:01:47.610> I<00:01:47.640> did

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
yeah probably if you do it the way I did

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.880 
yeah probably if you do it the way I did
it<00:01:48.240> somewhere<00:01:49.020> between<00:01:49.310> 20<00:01:50.310> inches<00:01:51.119> and<00:01:51.540> like

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:51.890 
it somewhere between 20 inches and like

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:57.590 
it somewhere between 20 inches and like
25<00:01:52.890> inches<00:01:53.520> but<00:01:54.450> um<00:01:54.689> the<00:01:55.640> this<00:01:56.640> you<00:01:57.030> can<00:01:57.240> pretty

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
25 inches but um the this you can pretty

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.630 
25 inches but um the this you can pretty
much<00:01:57.689> totally<00:01:58.530> customize<00:01:59.130> it<00:01:59.340> the<00:01:59.369> way<00:01:59.490> you

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
much totally customize it the way you

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.940 
much totally customize it the way you
want<00:01:59.969> you<00:02:00.210> do<00:02:00.360> not<00:02:00.390> have<00:02:00.899> to<00:02:01.049> do<00:02:01.200> anything<00:02:01.619> that

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
want you do not have to do anything that

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.620 
want you do not have to do anything that
I<00:02:01.979> did<00:02:03.560> you<00:02:04.560> most<00:02:04.890> likely<00:02:05.340> used<00:02:05.610> this<00:02:06.090> type<00:02:06.600> of

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
I did you most likely used this type of

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.559 
I did you most likely used this type of
bucket<00:02:07.229> for<00:02:07.979> the<00:02:08.099> base<00:02:08.280> but<00:02:08.700> other<00:02:09.119> than<00:02:09.479> that

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
bucket for the base but other than that

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.110 
bucket for the base but other than that
you<00:02:09.929> might<00:02:10.080> not<00:02:10.259> use<00:02:10.470> any

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
you might not use any

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.180 
you might not use any
that<00:02:11.330> I<00:02:11.450> use<00:02:11.690> you<00:02:12.200> might<00:02:12.379> not<00:02:12.530> even<00:02:12.560> use<00:02:12.860> this

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
that I use you might not even use this

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.110 
that I use you might not even use this
you<00:02:13.340> might<00:02:13.489> use<00:02:13.700> like<00:02:13.730> a<00:02:14.060> water<00:02:14.390> jug<00:02:14.840> from<00:02:16.120> one

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
you might use like a water jug from one

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.920 
you might use like a water jug from one
of<00:02:17.209> those<00:02:17.360> things<00:02:18.080> that<00:02:18.500> you<00:02:19.310> pour<00:02:19.519> out<00:02:19.640> water

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
of those things that you pour out water

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:23.410 
of those things that you pour out water
so<00:02:21.340> this<00:02:22.340> you<00:02:22.580> could<00:02:22.730> just<00:02:22.760> get<00:02:23.180> like<00:02:23.360> a

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
so this you could just get like a

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:29.289 
so this you could just get like a
plastic<00:02:24.409> tin<00:02:25.629> tin<00:02:26.629> like<00:02:27.730> pail<00:02:28.730> or<00:02:28.760> whatever

00:02:29.289 --> 00:02:29.299 
plastic tin tin like pail or whatever

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:32.410 
plastic tin tin like pail or whatever
you<00:02:30.079> don't<00:02:30.260> even<00:02:30.680> need<00:02:30.829> this<00:02:31.069> I<00:02:31.370> just<00:02:31.730> had<00:02:32.239> the

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
you don't even need this I just had the

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.440 
you don't even need this I just had the
frizz<00:02:32.659> because<00:02:33.110> this<00:02:33.349> is<00:02:33.530> a<00:02:33.560> little<00:02:33.950> bit<00:02:34.129> um

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
frizz because this is a little bit um

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:37.180 
frizz because this is a little bit um
not<00:02:35.450> as<00:02:35.599> wide<00:02:35.900> as<00:02:36.140> I<00:02:36.290> would<00:02:36.440> want<00:02:36.650> it<00:02:36.860> to<00:02:36.920> be

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
not as wide as I would want it to be

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:40.630 
not as wide as I would want it to be
it's<00:02:37.489> just<00:02:37.760> fortunate<00:02:38.060> that<00:02:38.390> I<00:02:38.659> found<00:02:39.640> this

if you're lucky you might not even have
to<00:03:15.410> pay<00:03:15.620> $2<00:03:16.280> so<00:03:16.880> this<00:03:17.150> is<00:03:17.359> like<00:03:17.630> really<00:03:18.200> non

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:18.980 
to pay $2 so this is like really non

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:23.440 
to pay $2 so this is like really non
expensive<00:03:19.849> so<00:03:20.540> you<00:03:20.569> need<00:03:20.989> um<00:03:21.849> to<00:03:22.849> get<00:03:23.389> a

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:23.450 
expensive so you need um to get a

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:26.379 
expensive so you need um to get a
threaded<00:03:24.139> rod<00:03:24.169> some<00:03:24.769> nuts<00:03:25.010> and<00:03:25.160> washers<00:03:25.400> um

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:26.389 
threaded rod some nuts and washers um

threaded rod some nuts and washers um
whatever<00:03:27.169> you<00:03:27.410> want<00:03:27.709> gonna<00:03:27.980> make<00:03:28.220> the<00:03:28.400> cup

00:03:28.659 --> 00:03:28.669 
whatever you want gonna make the cup

00:03:28.669 --> 00:03:32.680 
whatever you want gonna make the cup
with<00:03:28.940> and<00:03:29.239> also<00:03:30.200> some<00:03:31.190> sort<00:03:31.489> of<00:03:31.669> glue<00:03:31.970> cuz<00:03:32.419> um

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:32.690 
with and also some sort of glue cuz um

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:35.949 
with and also some sort of glue cuz um
when<00:03:33.230> well<00:03:33.650> you<00:03:33.799> don't<00:03:33.980> need<00:03:34.370> the<00:03:34.669> glue<00:03:34.940> but<00:03:35.690> if

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:35.959 
when well you don't need the glue but if

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:38.199 
when well you don't need the glue but if
you're<00:03:36.230> gonna<00:03:36.410> do<00:03:36.680> glue<00:03:37.099> a<00:03:37.129> threaded<00:03:37.700> rod<00:03:37.730> or

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:38.209 
you're gonna do glue a threaded rod or

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:40.030 
you're gonna do glue a threaded rod or
both<00:03:38.450> I'm<00:03:38.720> gonna<00:03:38.989> do<00:03:39.200> both<00:03:39.410> because<00:03:39.709> it<00:03:39.949> will

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:40.040 
both I'm gonna do both because it will

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:42.159 
both I'm gonna do both because it will
be<00:03:40.160> a<00:03:40.190> little<00:03:40.400> bit<00:03:40.669> more<00:03:40.819> secure<00:03:41.269> so<00:03:41.840> I'm<00:03:41.989> gonna

00:03:42.159 --> 00:03:42.169 
be a little bit more secure so I'm gonna

00:03:42.169 --> 00:03:43.750 
be a little bit more secure so I'm gonna
drill<00:03:42.590> the<00:03:42.709> holes<00:03:42.980> and<00:03:43.310> make<00:03:43.459> all<00:03:43.639> the

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:43.760 
drill the holes and make all the

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:45.699 
drill the holes and make all the
measurements<00:03:44.269> and<00:03:44.389> stuff<00:03:44.480> and<00:03:45.049> I'm<00:03:45.349> gonna<00:03:45.470> put

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:45.709 
measurements and stuff and I'm gonna put

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:48.849 
measurements and stuff and I'm gonna put
the<00:03:45.829> threaded<00:03:46.280> rod<00:03:46.310> through<00:03:47.269> here<00:03:47.989> and<00:03:48.169> then

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:48.859 
the threaded rod through here and then

00:03:48.859 --> 00:03:53.189 
the threaded rod through here and then
I'm<00:03:49.010> going<00:03:49.220> to<00:03:49.459> glue<00:03:50.319> hot<00:03:51.319> glue<00:03:51.349> all<00:03:52.010> the<00:03:52.190> edges

00:03:53.189 --> 00:03:53.199 
I'm going to glue hot glue all the edges

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:58.119 
I'm going to glue hot glue all the edges
to<00:03:54.199> make<00:03:54.230> sure<00:03:54.410> it's<00:03:54.889> like<00:03:55.340> extra<00:03:56.060> secure<00:03:57.129> but

00:03:58.119 --> 00:03:58.129 
to make sure it's like extra secure but

00:03:58.129 --> 00:04:01.119 
to make sure it's like extra secure but
um<00:03:58.340> if<00:03:58.849> you're<00:03:59.359> gonna<00:03:59.480> glue<00:03:59.840> it<00:03:59.870> and<00:04:00.230> use<00:04:00.949> the

00:04:01.119 --> 00:04:01.129 
um if you're gonna glue it and use the

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:03.099 
um if you're gonna glue it and use the
threaded<00:04:01.489> rod<00:04:01.519> if<00:04:01.970> you're<00:04:02.150> only<00:04:02.299> gonna<00:04:02.510> do<00:04:02.780> one

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:03.109 
threaded rod if you're only gonna do one

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:06.009 
threaded rod if you're only gonna do one
I<00:04:03.410> suggest<00:04:03.980> you<00:04:04.370> use<00:04:04.400> a<00:04:04.609> threaded<00:04:05.150> rod<00:04:05.180> because

00:04:06.009 --> 00:04:06.019 
I suggest you use a threaded rod because

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:09.000 
I suggest you use a threaded rod because
that<00:04:06.169> will<00:04:06.319> be<00:04:06.470> a<00:04:06.500> little<00:04:06.799> bit<00:04:07.040> more<00:04:07.870> secure

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:09.010 
that will be a little bit more secure

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:12.129 
that will be a little bit more secure
but<00:04:10.010> if<00:04:10.489> you<00:04:10.760> glue<00:04:11.060> it<00:04:11.090> you<00:04:11.389> don't<00:04:11.540> have<00:04:11.780> to<00:04:11.989> use

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:12.139 
but if you glue it you don't have to use

00:04:12.139 --> 00:04:14.319 
but if you glue it you don't have to use
hot<00:04:12.410> glue<00:04:12.440> you<00:04:12.949> can<00:04:12.980> use<00:04:13.160> superglue<00:04:13.790> you<00:04:14.180> can

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:14.329 
hot glue you can use superglue you can

00:04:14.329 --> 00:04:16.659 
hot glue you can use superglue you can
just<00:04:14.510> use<00:04:14.720> regular<00:04:14.930> all<00:04:15.319> glue<00:04:15.709> but<00:04:15.980> that<00:04:16.400> won't

00:04:16.659 --> 00:04:16.669 
just use regular all glue but that won't

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:19.120 
just use regular all glue but that won't
really<00:04:16.849> I<00:04:17.180> bet<00:04:17.989> that<00:04:18.169> wouldn't<00:04:18.500> stick<00:04:18.769> as<00:04:18.919> well

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:19.130 
really I bet that wouldn't stick as well

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:22.000 
really I bet that wouldn't stick as well
as<00:04:19.549> maybe<00:04:20.479> hot<00:04:20.750> glue<00:04:20.930> or<00:04:20.959> superglue<00:04:21.469> but

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:22.010 
as maybe hot glue or superglue but

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:24.250 
as maybe hot glue or superglue but
just<00:04:22.280> use<00:04:22.490> whatever<00:04:22.700> you<00:04:23.000> want<00:04:23.270> and<00:04:23.660> you<00:04:24.110> can

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:24.260 
just use whatever you want and you can

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.710 
just use whatever you want and you can
pretty<00:04:24.530> much<00:04:24.620> totally<00:04:25.310> customize<00:04:25.970> this<00:04:26.180> so

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:26.720 
pretty much totally customize this so

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:30.610 
pretty much totally customize this so
I'll<00:04:26.900> see<00:04:27.170> you<00:04:27.290> on<00:04:27.440> the<00:04:27.470> next<00:04:27.800> video<00:04:28.130> bye
