00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
can actually see noticeable results just

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:41.870 
can actually see noticeable results just
to<00:02:40.200> test<00:02:40.410> out<00:02:40.620> if<00:02:40.770> this<00:02:40.950> process<00:02:41.370> works<00:02:41.640> on

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
to test out if this process works on

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.090 
to test out if this process works on
other<00:02:42.450> shoes<00:02:42.840> that<00:02:42.870> use<00:02:43.320> the<00:02:43.470> same<00:02:43.650> midsole

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100

I'm going to remove the creases from the
Nike<00:02:52.170> charcoal<00:02:52.680> 8<00:02:52.800> so<00:02:53.520> this<00:02:53.760> is<00:02:53.940> the<00:02:54.060> Nike

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:43.120 
since steam is really hot it can

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:44.640 
since steam is really hot it can
actually<00:04:43.330> melt<00:04:43.870> the<00:04:44.020> glue<00:04:44.229> and<00:04:44.470> cause

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:44.650 
actually melt the glue and cause

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:47.310 
actually melt the glue and cause
separation<00:04:45.550> so<00:04:46.180> be<00:04:46.389> sure<00:04:46.570> to<00:04:46.750> take<00:04:46.930> breaks
