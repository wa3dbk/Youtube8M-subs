00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 hello there is a novel in this video I 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:07.379
 I'll show you how to play a new length song 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:09.660
 people a rather popular person to 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:11.070
 normal game and then we are separately 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.300
 analyze the work of the right and left hand 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.300
 drove the intro 

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:58.330
 because of saying and so on we start with 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:00.280
 introduction up you need to say that here in 

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:03.520
 this song in this version of chords you 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:05.980
 without a bar and not enough so have 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:08.500
 mind tight man barykin in this 

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:10.420
 execution and play begins 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.920
 intro you can start it with the same chord 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:15.400
 im playing 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:18.100
 and so first let's fight showed fight in 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:27.700
 Basically my favorite one we spend 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:38.950
 from down close the courtyard probably lit up 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:43.200
 on wings right i think here 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:47.649
 serve should not arise and go 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:52.259
 intro means entry begin with 

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:52.259
 chord same and push this way 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:57.650
 two times we win further goes cucumbers and 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.360
 here you can just play 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:09.110
 chord c again the young lady option 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:13.820
 thought of it and you can add such a chip then 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:16.580
 there is a half fight you move your little finger on 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:18.820
 6 fret of the second side is such 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:18.820
 thing 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:27.810
 starts for normal c not then move 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:27.810
 they years and it turns out such a thing 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:32.030
 I again them 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:55.790
 so we play it all together 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:58.690
 introduction 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:00.170
 went further the main lyrics 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:03.170
 em chords 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:08.500
 and here you are, we are starting yes for the world trolley 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:08.500
 trolleybus park cucumbers 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:21.590
 went again 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:24.620
 and c 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:33.090
 again our flash drive is used 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:38.850
 again to them. 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:44.510
 and then the chorus begins it begins with 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:44.510
 dmf chords 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.760
 f &amp; d 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:04:01.680
 I will play at the end of the chip 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:01.680
 then again two times 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:10.840
 means c 

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:13.030
 chip, in principle, all the farther you can play 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:15.849
 pullover i.e. loss is played again 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:25.449
 you can play the same chords 

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:27.669
 you play a song very very very 

00:04:25.449 --> 00:04:29.789
 lose play as you like 

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:32.169
 You can even play with her and start 

00:04:29.789 --> 00:04:35.380
 so let's just spill one more time and everything in 

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:41.620
 last time to fix means 

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:44.169

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:24.490
 and chorus chorus begins every single 

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:24.490
 time 

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:39.220
