00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.519
 Now again with your last lifting 

00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:07.729
 second video in the series 

00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:10.970
 Lea explains and I agree with this 

00:00:07.729 --> 00:00:12.410
 video much effort and I have 

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:14.300
 above all, make an effort to give yours 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:16.880
 to implement suggestions that you have 

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:20.449
 all now clearly explained here 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:22.430
 today it's about food 

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:25.130
 how is our food composed? 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:27.859
 and what does that matter for 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:28.490
 So we start our body completely 

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:31.160
 Beginning 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:33.769
 So here we have the food 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:35.359
 certain foods in themselves the 

00:00:33.769 --> 00:00:37.550
 food is made up of different 

00:00:35.359 --> 00:00:40.579
 I will assemble you together 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:44.809
 now will explain once the 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:47.170
 food namely micronutrients and 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:50.089
 made of micronutrients 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:54.079
 both differ in several 

00:00:50.089 --> 00:00:56.809
 things from each other and both flow 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:59.329
 then in the metabolism a 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:01.639
 the metabolism I have you in yes 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:03.889
 the first video explains what the 

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:07.390
 Metabolism is made by the 

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:10.880
 metabolism becomes energy heat co2 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:12.130
 water and yes we have our expert 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:15.640
 arise from it 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:17.810
 and that's what it takes 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:21.230
 micronutrients and micronutrients 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:23.950
 From the food we catch the macro 

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:28.250
 nutrients to macro nutrients 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:30.460
 carbohydrates proteins and fats 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:35.090
 I have another one in brackets 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:36.830
 Fiber Fiber counts now 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:39.380
 not directly to the macro nutrients 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:42.790
 but you can count micronutrients 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:47.960
 therefore, know here above clear 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:49.610
 Micronutrients have calories and that 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.800
 of course, most of you know 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:53.720
 I or probably already the one 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:56.690
 have different micronutrients 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:02:00.350
 has different calories and though 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:03.410
 one gram carbohydrates 4.1 calories a 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:08.030
 grams of protein as well as 4.1 calories and 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:10.330
 a headset has 93 calories 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:13.270
 more than twice as much as 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:16.750
 carbohydrates and proteins 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:20.260
 nevertheless, fat and proteins are 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:24.740
 essential nutrients carbohydrates 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:28.570
 it is purely physiological 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:31.489
 not necessarily seen though 

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:33.560
 but highly recommended and very 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:36.650
 advise why follow later ones 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:40.190
 videos then we come to the 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:43.010
 micronutrients have micronutrients 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:45.020
 unlike macro nutrients, none 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:46.670
 measurable calories 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:49.540
 that's what she is 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:52.720
 fundamentally different from each other 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:56.510
 Micronutrients are used for 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:59.480
 energy recovery in our metabolism 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:03.250
 in our system in our body 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:06.459
 Micronutrients do not supply the body 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:08.239
 necessary energy, however 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:11.000
 That's why I have hers too 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:13.760
 Exclamation mark is the role of 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.620
 micronutrients nevertheless extremely extreme 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:17.090
 important and should by no means 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:21.160
 be ignored 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:24.760
 Micro materials are vitamins mineral 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:28.459
 Minerals secondary plant substances 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:31.310
 trace elements and liquid like 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:33.620
 said everything except we take ours 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:38.360
 calories in liquid form so liquid 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:41.220
 food or alcohol but usually 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:45.330
 these micronutrients have no 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:46.530
 Calories and they also work in and on 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:50.760
 the metabolism 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:54.840
 but as the metabolism wins out 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:58.110
 the macro nutrients energy merkel co2 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:04:00.180
 h2 and what's left over 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:03.260
 mainly from the fiber 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:07.680
 there will be our experiments 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:10.590
 yes, but he can do this energy 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:13.830
 through the macro nutrients only gets 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:15.840
 use efficiently though the 

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:18.600
 Micronutrients are the 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:20.700
 Micronutrients work in ours 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:23.310
 body in our metabolism as 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:26.580
 Enzymes means they let them 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:30.270
 processes this reaction of metabolism 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:34.080
 in itself it's just a chain of reactions 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:36.980
 in the body with output products and 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:39.930
 end products and this reaction of 

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:42.990
 output macro nutrient too 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:46.980
 end product energy heat h2o and so on 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:49.230
 Next came now only correct and good 

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:52.530
 We will take these enzymes 

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:54.540
 because enzymes let this reaction 

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:58.020
 easier and faster and better 

00:04:54.540 --> 00:05:00.600
 drain and these micronutrients 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:03.150
 are only in processed 

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:05.120
 natural food is why it is 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:08.190
 neglecting in no case a 

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:10.640
 most of its food and processed 

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:17.370
 and to take in nature 

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:20.640
 And that's why never the 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:22.050
 neglect micronutrients finds 

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:23.479
 you in every natural one 

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:25.890
 Food fruits vegetables 

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:30.060
 wholegrain cereals legumes 

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:31.080
 potatoes and so on and so forth 

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:33.630
 exactly 

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:34.500
 only then can your metabolism be right 

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:37.569
 function 

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:40.899
 and that was already the 2nd 

00:05:37.569 --> 00:05:43.689
 a video of empty explained to the topic 

00:05:40.899 --> 00:05:45.759
 food and how the food 

00:05:43.689 --> 00:05:47.979
 at all I hope it has 

00:05:45.759 --> 00:05:49.330
 I like you, I hope it is better 

00:05:47.979 --> 00:05:51.099
 as the first video 

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:52.389
 if so I would be very much a 

00:05:51.099 --> 00:05:54.969
 thumbs upwards 

00:05:52.389 --> 00:06:04.800
 until next time your teacher 

00:05:54.969 --> 00:06:04.800
 lifting look
