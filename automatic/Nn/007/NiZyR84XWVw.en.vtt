screwing<00:00:30.539> and<00:00:30.990> the<00:00:31.529> screwing<00:00:32.059> usually<00:00:33.059> goes

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
screwing and the screwing usually goes

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.750 
screwing and the screwing usually goes
six<00:00:34.020> on<00:00:34.200> the<00:00:34.320> edge<00:00:34.440> twelve<00:00:34.980> on<00:00:35.130> the<00:00:35.219> field<00:00:35.550> if

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
six on the edge twelve on the field if

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.360 
six on the edge twelve on the field if
you're<00:00:35.850> screwing<00:00:36.420> and<00:00:36.920> four<00:00:37.920> on<00:00:38.070> the<00:00:38.250> edge

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
you're screwing and four on the edge

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.760 
you're screwing and four on the edge
like<00:00:39.210> eight<00:00:39.480> in<00:00:39.719> the<00:00:39.809> field<00:00:40.079> or<00:00:40.290> six<00:00:40.590> in<00:00:40.739> the

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
like eight in the field or six in the

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.590 
like eight in the field or six in the
field<00:00:41.010> if<00:00:41.160> you're<00:00:41.309> nailing<00:00:41.520> we're<00:00:42.210> screwing

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
field if you're nailing we're screwing

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.690 
field if you're nailing we're screwing
so<00:00:43.440> it's<00:00:44.010> like<00:00:45.710> six<00:00:46.710> on<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:47.010> edge<00:00:47.129> twelve<00:00:47.550> in

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
so it's like six on the edge twelve in

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.420 
so it's like six on the edge twelve in
the<00:00:47.730> field<00:00:48.000> and<00:00:48.379> as<00:00:49.379> far<00:00:49.649> as<00:00:49.770> that<00:00:49.890> goes<00:00:49.950> I<00:00:50.399> just

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
the field and as far as that goes I just

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.790 
the field and as far as that goes I just
usually<00:00:50.910> go<00:00:51.149> six<00:00:51.480> inches<00:00:51.809> all<00:00:52.199> the<00:00:52.350> time

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
usually go six inches all the time

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.040 
usually go six inches all the time
I<00:00:52.829> try<00:00:53.699> to<00:00:53.760> keep<00:00:53.910> the<00:00:54.059> screwing<00:00:54.390> in<00:00:54.510> six<00:00:54.719> inches

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
I try to keep the screwing in six inches

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.900 
I try to keep the screwing in six inches
because<00:00:55.289> nobody<00:00:55.680> complains<00:00:56.070> about<00:00:56.219> overdoing

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
because nobody complains about overdoing

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
whole bunch of screws that really ain't

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.480 
whole bunch of screws that really ain't
holding<00:01:51.360> the<00:01:51.450> drywall<00:01:51.869> in<00:01:52.110> but<00:01:52.740> just<00:01:52.979> kind<00:01:53.430> of

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
holding the drywall in but just kind of

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.190 
holding the drywall in but just kind of
like<00:01:53.700> you<00:01:54.030> know<00:01:54.149> holding<00:01:54.869> your<00:01:55.020> drywall

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
like you know holding your drywall

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.429 
like you know holding your drywall
against<00:01:55.680> the<00:01:55.770> wall<00:01:55.920> so<00:01:56.840> when<00:01:57.840> the<00:01:57.960> inspectors

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
against the wall so when the inspectors

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.499 
against the wall so when the inspectors
inspect<00:01:58.619> they<00:01:59.340> will<00:01:59.640> look<00:01:59.759> at<00:01:59.909> your<00:02:00.030> screwing

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
inspect they will look at your screwing

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.780 
inspect they will look at your screwing
and<00:02:00.689> if<00:02:01.259> they<00:02:01.439> see<00:02:01.500> a<00:02:01.710> whole<00:02:02.070> lot<00:02:02.340> of<00:02:02.369> screws

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
and if they see a whole lot of screws

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.600 
and if they see a whole lot of screws
like<00:02:03.000> this<00:02:03.299> this<00:02:04.229> right<00:02:04.469> here<00:02:04.770> is<00:02:04.799> would<00:02:05.579> be

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
like this this right here is would be

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.260 
like this this right here is would be
considered<00:02:06.469> wrong<00:02:07.550> well<00:02:08.550> this<00:02:08.970> one<00:02:09.149> right

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
considered wrong well this one right

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.940 
considered wrong well this one right
here<00:02:09.539> would<00:02:09.720> consider<00:02:10.349> right<00:02:10.760> so<00:02:11.760> if<00:02:12.000> they<00:02:12.120> see

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
here would consider right so if they see

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:15.250 
here would consider right so if they see
a<00:02:13.069> whole<00:02:13.849> lot<00:02:14.239> of<00:02:14.390> these<00:02:14.540> and<00:02:15.020> then<00:02:15.110> I'll

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
a whole lot of these and then I'll

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:16.630 
a whole lot of these and then I'll
probably<00:02:15.440> ask<00:02:15.650> you<00:02:15.830> to<00:02:15.890> rescrew<00:02:16.310> your<00:02:16.459> drywall

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
probably ask you to rescrew your drywall

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.550 
probably ask you to rescrew your drywall
and<00:02:18.370> that's<00:02:19.370> base
