00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:02.790 
okay it's looking pretty good now you

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:04.849 
okay it's looking pretty good now you
can<00:00:02.939> see<00:00:03.270> I<00:00:03.510> had<00:00:03.840> to<00:00:03.870> do<00:00:04.049> some<00:00:04.259> configuring<00:00:04.740> in

00:00:04.849 --> 00:00:04.859 
can see I had to do some configuring in

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:09.620 
can see I had to do some configuring in
the<00:00:04.950> BIOS<00:00:06.200> on<00:00:07.200> the<00:00:07.980> computer<00:00:08.490> there<00:00:08.639> but<00:00:08.910> looks

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
the BIOS on the computer there but looks

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.430 
the BIOS on the computer there but looks
like<00:00:10.969> let's<00:00:11.969> you<00:00:12.090> can<00:00:12.210> get<00:00:12.330> a<00:00:12.360> close-up<00:00:12.570> shot

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
like let's you can get a close-up shot

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.129 
like let's you can get a close-up shot
of<00:00:13.469> the<00:00:13.799> computer<00:00:14.250> here<00:00:14.809> looks<00:00:15.809> like<00:00:15.960> we're

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
of the computer here looks like we're

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:17.750 
of the computer here looks like we're
doing<00:00:16.230> pretty<00:00:16.350> good<00:00:16.740> with<00:00:16.800> the<00:00:17.070> grinch<00:00:17.460> don't

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
doing pretty good with the grinch don't

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:25.250 
doing pretty good with the grinch don't
good<00:00:17.970> business<00:00:18.359> here<00:00:22.580> whoops<00:00:23.840> and<00:00:24.840> it<00:00:24.960> goes<00:00:25.050> in

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
good business here whoops and it goes in

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.800 
good business here whoops and it goes in
here<00:00:25.529> so<00:00:25.680> I<00:00:25.800> see<00:00:26.279> the<00:00:26.460> screen<00:00:27.359> a<00:00:27.390> little<00:00:27.660> bit

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
here so I see the screen a little bit

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.669 
here so I see the screen a little bit
better<00:00:28.010> and<00:00:29.010> it's<00:00:29.160> giving<00:00:29.429> it<00:00:30.050> its<00:00:31.050> I<00:00:31.500> think

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
better and it's giving it its I think

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.049 
better and it's giving it its I think
it's<00:00:31.800> rings<00:00:32.070> some<00:00:32.309> updates<00:00:32.700> right<00:00:32.850> at<00:00:32.969> the

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
it's rings some updates right at the

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:34.610 
it's rings some updates right at the
moment<00:00:33.180> here<00:00:33.600> so<00:00:33.930> let's<00:00:34.200> give<00:00:34.350> it<00:00:34.440> a<00:00:34.469> little

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
moment here so let's give it a little

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:35.900 
moment here so let's give it a little
time<00:00:34.829> here<00:00:35.010> and<00:00:35.100> see<00:00:35.219> what<00:00:35.340> happens

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
time here and see what happens

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.240 
time here and see what happens
hopefully<00:00:36.780> it<00:00:37.380> hopefully<00:00:37.829> it'll<00:00:37.950> do<00:00:38.070> what<00:00:38.190> I

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
hopefully it hopefully it'll do what I

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.229 
hopefully it hopefully it'll do what I
wanted<00:00:38.520> to<00:00:38.640> do<00:00:40.460> so<00:00:41.460> you<00:00:41.910> know<00:00:42.030> the<00:00:42.120> newer

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
wanted to do so you know the newer

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:43.459 
wanted to do so you know the newer
motherboard<00:00:42.719> so<00:00:42.899> it's<00:00:43.020> going<00:00:43.110> to<00:00:43.170> take<00:00:43.260> some

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
motherboard so it's going to take some

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.850 
motherboard so it's going to take some
time<00:00:43.649> to<00:00:43.860> run<00:00:44.040> some<00:00:44.100> updates<00:00:44.579> so<00:00:44.879> let's<00:00:45.860> see

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
time to run some updates so let's see

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.709 
time to run some updates so let's see
what's<00:00:46.980> going<00:00:47.100> to<00:00:47.129> happen<00:00:47.430> here<00:00:47.640> it's<00:00:48.600> been

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
what's going to happen here it's been

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:54.650 
what's going to happen here it's been
pretty<00:00:48.870> promising<00:00:49.289> here<00:00:53.449> okay<00:00:54.449> it's

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
pretty promising here okay it's

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.319 
pretty promising here okay it's
restarting<00:00:55.079> that's<00:00:55.699> meaning<00:00:56.699> that<00:00:56.789> it<00:00:57.059> looks

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
restarting that's meaning that it looks

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:58.610 
restarting that's meaning that it looks
like<00:00:57.390> all<00:00:57.570> the<00:00:57.660> updates<00:00:57.960> have<00:00:58.109> been<00:00:58.260> applied

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
like all the updates have been applied

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:08.390 
like all the updates have been applied
here<00:00:58.649> let<00:00:59.070> me<00:00:59.660> sneak<00:01:00.660> in<00:01:00.870> here<00:01:01.109> sit<00:01:01.800> down<00:01:07.400> says

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
here let me sneak in here sit down says

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:16.790 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:19.810 

I<00:01:16.900> turn<00:01:17.900> the<00:01:18.140> it<00:01:18.650> was<00:01:18.770> looking<00:01:19.070> for<00:01:19.250> the<00:01:19.370> floppy

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:19.820 
I turn the it was looking for the floppy

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:22.210 
I turn the it was looking for the floppy
drive<00:01:20.090> and<00:01:20.240> the<00:01:21.020> computer<00:01:21.740> does<00:01:21.890> not<00:01:21.920> have<00:01:22.070> a

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:22.220 
drive and the computer does not have a

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:24.550 
drive and the computer does not have a
floppy<00:01:22.460> drive<00:01:22.700> in<00:01:22.970> it<00:01:23.090> I<00:01:23.270> don't<00:01:23.330> know<00:01:23.510> why<00:01:23.750> it

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:24.560 
floppy drive in it I don't know why it

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:25.900 
floppy drive in it I don't know why it
can<00:01:24.740> be<00:01:24.830> programmed<00:01:25.100> for<00:01:25.310> a<00:01:25.430> floppy<00:01:25.670> drive

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:25.910 
can be programmed for a floppy drive

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:28.630 
can be programmed for a floppy drive
because<00:01:26.270> no<00:01:26.780> computers<00:01:27.260> to<00:01:27.560> the<00:01:27.680> state<00:01:27.950> you

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:28.640 
because no computers to the state you

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.860 
because no computers to the state you
use<00:01:28.760> floppy<00:01:29.000> drive<00:01:29.530> they're<00:01:30.530> not<00:01:30.740> tional

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:31.870 
use floppy drive they're not tional

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:34.990 
use floppy drive they're not tional
parts<00:01:32.870> if<00:01:32.990> you<00:01:33.080> want<00:01:33.350> but<00:01:33.680> I<00:01:34.040> don't<00:01:34.610> deal<00:01:34.790> that

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.000 
parts if you want but I don't deal that

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.560 
parts if you want but I don't deal that
I<00:01:35.330> use<00:01:36.320> my<00:01:36.530> trusted<00:01:36.920> reliable<00:01:37.100> CDs<00:01:37.880> DVDs<00:01:38.360> and

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:38.570 
I use my trusted reliable CDs DVDs and

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:41.290 
I use my trusted reliable CDs DVDs and
such<00:01:38.860> so<00:01:39.860> we'll<00:01:40.010> see<00:01:40.190> what<00:01:40.280> happens<00:01:40.670> here<00:01:40.970> got

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:41.300 
such so we'll see what happens here got

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:45.160 
such so we'll see what happens here got
an<00:01:41.420> arrow<00:01:43.540> it's<00:01:44.540> going<00:01:44.660> to<00:01:44.720> take<00:01:44.810> some<00:01:44.930> time<00:01:45.080> to

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:45.170 
an arrow it's going to take some time to

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:50.530 
an arrow it's going to take some time to
boot<00:01:45.320> up<00:01:45.350> because<00:01:49.030> then<00:01:50.030> have<00:01:50.150> the<00:01:50.240> volume

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:50.540 
boot up because then have the volume

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:52.810 
boot up because then have the volume
turned<00:01:50.570> up<00:01:50.810> very<00:01:51.020> low<00:01:51.170> but<00:01:51.470> ok<00:01:52.280> it's

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:52.820 
turned up very low but ok it's

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.260 
turned up very low but ok it's
