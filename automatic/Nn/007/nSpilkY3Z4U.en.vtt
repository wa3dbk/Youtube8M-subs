00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:06.810
 and we continue to get the Argentines 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.580
 now the super fast side of banana 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.920
 he explained you've already seen me show you 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.139
 resources several times we use the 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.389
 base banana the frozen banana that 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.789
 I'm going to cut wheels of 2 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.800
 centimeters the ace the banana cuts it 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.439
 projects 2 centimeters and you take it to 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:25.580
 freeze me in my house this always what 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:28.650
 I'll tell you again, I usually have bags 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:30.090
 with a banana cut in revenues already 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.669
 I have several bags of a banana 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.140
 because it's a portion I already have it with 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.550
 that we have thought of them then when 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.160
 I want to make a quick ice cream to me to 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.690
 lohan to china I love this I mix it 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.920
 with different types of fruits in this 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.690
 case what I'm going to do with banana is 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.809
 Colista pulled her out of there ten minutes 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.440
 before so that they are not at all 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:49.850
 frozen I'm just going to show you the 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.850
 texture this as it is 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:55.239
 I put it as in a base and sent it to 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.860
 Frisar and then when I have it 

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:58.420
 when it's already really hard 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:00.130
 divided into more or less portions of a 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:02.230
 banana per serving this is made with mix 

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:04.330
 the comic be handy then when you 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:06.630
 what's frozen you get it 10 minutes before 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:08.830
 and look how it is on the banana that is 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.110
 frozen but a little softer it 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:12.670
 begins to break is justly necessary 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:14.110
 so that you do not break the machine will be done 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:16.180
 a machine like this house is spending 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:17.770
 breaking a lot in this case what can 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:20.050
 do it alone with banana you can mix it 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:21.430
 with strawberry and orange as soloist 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:22.720
 the other day I'm going to do it 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:24.220
 mixing it with chocolate then a 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:26.020
 barbarian resource can be with mango with 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:28.899
 many things in this case bakery 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:32.020
 banana we will put at a rate of 2 

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:34.509
 more or less well frozen bananas 10 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:36.550
 minutes before I took it out of the freezer for 

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:39.610
 that start small to lose 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:40.840
 temperature with this I'm also going to 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:43.540
 put a good spoonful of sweet of 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.980
 common pastry milk the one you want 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:47.590
 and that's all this is going to be our 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:49.870
 sweetener and that's going to generate the texture 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:50.920
 of an ice cream if you never saw it 

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:52.930
 because this I have already done two or three 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.270
 times with different flavors if you do not 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:57.610
 you saw never watch seeing what happens and 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:58.960
 you're going to see the texture of ice cream in ice cream 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:01.480
 fastest in the world because faster 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:05.880
 impossible that generates this for the 

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:05.880
 guys approve the mixer 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.720
 there is generating the texture 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.940
 quickly the areas on the 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.290
 blades are giving the temperature not 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.980
 they only go fast but they are giving 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:21.870
 more temperature 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.780
 let's try not much else if I do not 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:26.580
 I want to go with the milk one if you 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.909
 raisins give you so much heat that it melts 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.909
 all 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:40.040
 look at the texture 

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:51.810
 I have a clean hand but I'm going to touch the 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:54.440
 healthier texture impossible we visit in 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.440
 one second 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:05.670
 listening to this in this vanitas 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:09.330
 directly to the feesl 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:12.450
 at the time of putting it in the cup 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:15.630
 quite a lot and of course they come 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:19.830
 to try give them white chocolate to 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:22.040
 Add to it how chocolate can be 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:22.040
 White 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:38.859
 and once they do a lot in 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:40.840
 Central America I had this from a 

00:03:38.859 --> 00:03:42.849
 cooks a great argentine cuisine which 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:44.260
 I got up Saturday one day I worked with 

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:46.959
 she once worked with her juliana 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:48.609
 lopez may I learned to do this only with 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:50.439
 bananas for everything in Central America 

00:03:48.609 --> 00:03:52.689
 that there is so much banana so much what 

00:03:50.439 --> 00:03:55.680
 they do this very much as is the case 

00:03:52.689 --> 00:03:55.680
 let's try we put 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:04.900
 the consistency of an ice cream the 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:06.460
 consistency of healthier ice cream 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:13.120
 impossible your boy will love 

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:15.160
 some are going to be all we are going to 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:16.630
 a cut quickly and we're coming to 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:18.370
 make this wonderful program try 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:21.570
 a lot of things tell you what we're going 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:23.330
 to continue doing stay there we continue 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:25.270
 [Music] 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:27.570
 m 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:31.580
 slowly in a chain 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:31.580
 and it loosened my heart
