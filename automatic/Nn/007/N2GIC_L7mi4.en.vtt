I'm gonna radius the fretboard with the
light<00:00:32.550> radius<00:00:33.059> probably<00:00:33.899> going<00:00:34.020> to<00:00:34.110> go

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
light radius probably going to go

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.299 
light radius probably going to go
somewhere<00:00:35.160> in<00:00:35.340> the<00:00:35.460> region<00:00:35.820> of<00:00:36.649> 20<00:00:37.649> inches<00:00:38.040> I

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
somewhere in the region of 20 inches I

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.990 
somewhere in the region of 20 inches I
noticed<00:00:39.120> that<00:00:39.210> the<00:00:39.300> godown<00:00:40.219> fretless<00:00:41.219> nylon

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
noticed that the godown fretless nylon

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.200 
noticed that the godown fretless nylon
strings<00:00:42.300> I've<00:00:42.450> got<00:00:42.600> a<00:00:42.629> 16<00:00:43.079> inch<00:00:43.320> radius<00:00:44.160> I<00:00:44.579> want

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
strings I've got a 16 inch radius I want

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.869 
strings I've got a 16 inch radius I want
to<00:00:45.270> try<00:00:45.450> going<00:00:45.750> a<00:00:46.250> little<00:00:47.250> bigger<00:00:47.460> than<00:00:47.579> that

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
to try going a little bigger than that

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.610 
to try going a little bigger than that
though<00:00:48.120> so<00:00:48.480> hence<00:00:48.840> the<00:00:49.430> the<00:00:50.430> 20<00:00:50.760> inch<00:00:50.910> radius

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:51.620 
though so hence the the 20 inch radius

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:53.600 
though so hence the the 20 inch radius
so<00:00:52.620> yeah<00:00:52.710> I'm<00:00:52.770> going<00:00:52.920> to<00:00:52.949> go<00:00:53.070> ahead<00:00:53.190> and<00:00:53.460> pull

so yeah I'm going to go ahead and pull

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.029 
so yeah I'm going to go ahead and pull
the<00:00:53.730> frets<00:00:54.030> and<00:00:54.300> then<00:00:54.960> radius<00:00:55.620> up<00:00:55.800> I'm<00:00:55.920> going

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
the frets and then radius up I'm going

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.930 
the frets and then radius up I'm going
to<00:00:56.100> fill<00:00:56.309> the<00:00:56.460> slots<00:00:56.760> and<00:00:58.550> also<00:00:59.550> gonna<00:00:59.699> have<00:00:59.850> to

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.190 
radius that's on here and also the
saddle<00:01:53.880> is<00:01:54.270> gonna<00:01:54.479> be<00:01:54.540> interesting<00:01:54.899> thing<00:01:55.049> to

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
saddle is gonna be interesting thing to

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.780 
saddle is gonna be interesting thing to
do<00:01:55.430> and<00:01:56.430> then<00:01:57.090> she<00:01:57.119> should<00:01:57.450> be<00:01:57.479> good<00:01:57.780> so<00:01:58.790> now

do and then she should be good so now
the<00:02:00.570> fretless<00:02:00.840> is<00:02:01.170> done<00:02:01.850> we<00:02:02.850> did<00:02:02.969> one<00:02:03.210> trial

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
the fretless is done we did one trial

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.740 
the fretless is done we did one trial
where<00:02:04.229> the<00:02:05.149> action<00:02:06.149> was<00:02:06.299> set<00:02:06.509> at<00:02:06.630> one

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
where the action was set at one

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.009 
where the action was set at one
particular<00:02:06.930> point<00:02:08.179> and

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:11.019 
particular point and

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
I had another go at the action at the

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.300 
I had another go at the action at the
nuts<00:02:13.239> and<00:02:13.480> now<00:02:13.659> we're<00:02:13.840> pretty<00:02:13.989> happy<00:02:14.920> with<00:02:15.159> it
