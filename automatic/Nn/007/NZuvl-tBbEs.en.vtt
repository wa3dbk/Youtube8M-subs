00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
herb I let down that made sense so it's

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.920 
herb I let down that made sense so it's
really<00:00:59.129> easy<00:00:59.250> might<00:01:00.180> take<00:01:00.359> a<00:01:00.390> few<00:01:00.480> tries<00:01:00.870> to

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
really easy might take a few tries to

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.500 
really easy might take a few tries to
get<00:01:01.350> like<00:01:01.590> a<00:01:01.829> good<00:01:02.430> amount<00:01:02.609> of<00:01:02.760> eyelash<00:01:03.120> in<00:01:03.329> as

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
get like a good amount of eyelash in as

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.299 
get like a good amount of eyelash in as
you<00:01:03.989> can<00:01:04.170> see<00:01:04.320> like<00:01:04.500> a<00:01:04.530> little<00:01:04.860> chunk<00:01:05.129> is

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
you can see like a little chunk is

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.219 
you can see like a little chunk is
missing<00:01:05.640> because<00:01:05.790> it's<00:01:05.939> like<00:01:06.060> in<00:01:06.299> there<00:01:06.570> and

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
missing because it's like in there and

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.620 
missing because it's like in there and
if<00:01:08.010> that<00:01:08.189> bothers<00:01:08.580> you<00:01:08.760> you<00:01:08.820> can<00:01:09.119> try<00:01:09.330> a<00:01:09.360> couple

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
if that bothers you you can try a couple

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.859 
if that bothers you you can try a couple
times<00:01:09.990> so<00:01:10.710> that<00:01:10.830> it's<00:01:10.950> lost<00:01:11.130> visible<00:01:11.549> um<00:01:12.030> but

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
times so that it's lost visible um but

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.160 
times so that it's lost visible um but
yeah<00:01:13.049> and<00:01:13.290> then<00:01:13.350> once<00:01:13.619> you're<00:01:13.770> done<00:01:13.799> you<00:01:14.580> just

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.170 
yeah and then once you're done you just

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.530 
yeah and then once you're done you just
push<00:01:16.170> your<00:01:16.290> eyelashes<00:01:16.799> up<00:01:17.009> and<00:01:17.280> I<00:01:18.240> don't<00:01:18.299> know

push your eyelashes up and I don't know

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.499

if<00:01:18.600> you<00:01:18.750> can<00:01:18.900> see<00:01:19.229> but<00:01:19.619> they<00:01:19.890> are<00:01:20.509> completely

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
if you can see but they are completely

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.870 
if you can see but they are completely
fine<00:01:21.780> no<00:01:22.380> problems<00:01:22.950> whatsoever

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
fine no problems whatsoever

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.640 
fine no problems whatsoever
and<00:01:24.360> I<00:01:24.450> show<00:01:24.600> this<00:01:24.720> on<00:01:24.900> Kanani<00:01:25.229> because<00:01:25.530> she

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
and I show this on Kanani because she

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.130 
and I show this on Kanani because she
has<00:01:25.740> slanted<00:01:26.130> eyes<00:01:26.280> and<00:01:26.640> I<00:01:27.509> just<00:01:27.540> want<00:01:27.900> to<00:01:28.020> show

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
has slanted eyes and I just want to show

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.550 
has slanted eyes and I just want to show
that<00:01:28.170> works<00:01:28.560> on<00:01:28.740> any<00:01:28.950> faithful<00:01:29.400> see<00:01:30.329> so<00:01:31.079> here's

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
that works on any faithful see so here's

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.219 
that works on any faithful see so here's
the<00:01:31.829> very<00:01:32.070> obvious<00:01:32.400> tape<00:01:33.180> method<00:01:33.450> on<00:01:33.869> this

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
the very obvious tape method on this

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.789 
the very obvious tape method on this
side<00:01:34.500> and<00:01:34.710> then<00:01:35.250> my<00:01:35.460> method<00:01:35.850> on<00:01:36.000> this<00:01:36.180> side<00:01:36.420> and

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:36.799 
side and then my method on this side and

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:43.100 
side and then my method on this side and
um<00:01:38.210> this<00:01:39.210> is<00:01:39.570> very<00:01:39.930> obvious<00:01:40.470> looking<00:01:40.619> and<00:01:42.110> also

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
um this is very obvious looking and also

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.230 
um this is very obvious looking and also
so<00:01:43.740> like<00:01:43.979> because<00:01:44.399> people<00:01:44.850> don't<00:01:45.060> actually

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
so like because people don't actually

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.090 
so like because people don't actually
take<00:01:45.509> down<00:01:45.720> my<00:01:45.899> eyelashes<00:01:46.560> when<00:01:46.710> they<00:01:46.829> blink

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
take down my eyelashes when they blink

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.789 
take down my eyelashes when they blink
so<00:01:47.670> it's<00:01:47.790> very<00:01:47.909> obvious<00:01:48.030> looking<00:01:48.570> and<00:01:48.930> also

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
so it's very obvious looking and also

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.530 
so it's very obvious looking and also
when<00:01:50.070> you<00:01:50.250> pull<00:01:50.520> off<00:01:50.729> the<00:01:50.909> tape<00:01:51.090> you<00:01:51.240> have<00:01:51.360> to

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
when you pull off the tape you have to

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.230 
when you pull off the tape you have to
be<00:01:51.630> really<00:01:51.899> careful<00:01:52.049> because<00:01:52.700> the<00:01:53.700> adhesive

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
be really careful because the adhesive

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.270 
be really careful because the adhesive
