00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:11.639
 yes knew that if I'm in belgrade is 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:12.660
 there right behind me roughly by that I 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.470
 shows you the head we can ask ourselves 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:19.410
 other productions not seen very well 

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:21.869
 the novak djokovic center is thus made 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.730
 this video is just for 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.560
 tell you to create your own victory 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.710
 I received a lot of emails from people 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:31.740
 who tell me they stress in match 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.719
 and if you stress in hand it's because 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.210
 that you focus too much 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.980
 on the victory 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:39.450
 and often I bring you back to 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.360
 the interview with benoÃ®t foucher who is 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.230
 exceptional then it's benoÃ®t it's a 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.809
 former atp player 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.910
 he lost 50 games after having the 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.559
 least a match point for him and 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.850
 suddenly something has changed 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.230
 this from the moment he created his 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.410
 own victory either he wrote a 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.699
 book by the way on the subject and 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:58.649
 especially the messages I receive 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.079
 today of people who tell me and 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.340
 alexis here I do not understand I you 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.030
 I do not go so well in match 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.920
 than in training 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.000
 me if it happens to me elsewhere and it's 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.990
 when I focus too much on the 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.189
 victory when I'm sure to win 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.810
 when I say to myself I have to win this 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:13.080
 match because the next game I 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.549
 let's get perf and after that's where 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.130
 all of a sudden I start to stress 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:19.170
 not really I eat so the idea is 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.180
 to create your own victory this is to 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.280
 say how do I know that 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:26.009
 for me this match a victory will me 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.479
 to make progress and to the dukes 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.700
 be low - the goal is to win 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.689
 6-1 6-2 your goal it's going to be a 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.549
 month I have to show twice to 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:36.930
 net by game I must I 

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:37.590
 I have to attack or 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.140
 play lax 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.850
 I have to be able to play in myself 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.890
 concentrating when I'm serving I'm 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.090
 focuses on the first two points to 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.310
 it's going to be things like this and that 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.920
 you know if in the end you have 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.270
 won you have created your own 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.829
 victory so from now 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.840
 try to define for you what is it 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:56.219
 win a match and that's going to be in 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.680
 depending on the player profile you 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:00.540
 want to develop if you are rather 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.280
 attacker if you are rather defensive 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.570
 it's more defensive it's going to be 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.040
 example me I know that I win my 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.899
 match if I can put three times the 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.829
 ball beyond the service line and that 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.929
 is going to be items like that they 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:10.960
 will allow you to actually create 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.250
 your own 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:14.380
 victory is whether you have 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.180
 won or not stand regardless of the 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.220
 score behind so 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.900
 focus on it create your 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.310
 own victory right at the end of this 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.720
 video defined elsewhere that's what it wants 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:24.700
 say what for you to win a match for 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.590
 me for example to if we ask the 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:29.590
 question right now that's for me 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:32.710
 win a match that's when I'm going to be 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:35.080
 able to tell me at each service 

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:36.220
 I will be able to define where is that 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:38.350
 I put my first ball and we see this 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:39.760
 that I put in second blow to the first 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:41.950
 blow so my service and my second 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:43.660
 blow if I'm able to do that 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:45.010
 during a whole match 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.240
 well I know I should be won 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:47.590
 created my own victory and that I would have 

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:49.120
 earned my mask regardless of the score 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:51.520
 I know that's how I'm going 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.050
 better play and that will be my victory at the 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:54.490
 end but I will be satisfied if I have 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:55.720
 managed to focus on that and 

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:57.430
 it's a lot easier on it 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:00.130
 because it's an element on which 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:01.630
 you have control you have the 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:03.220
 control over this tonic element on the 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:03.760
 victory you do not have control over 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:04.930
 victory 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.370
 that is, there are elements 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:08.020
 outside there is your opponent and 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:09.430
 So it's very difficult 

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:11.260
 is in frustration that will generate 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:12.790
 nervousness while when you 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:15.580
 you focus on an element that is 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:19.540
 under your control as focus 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:21.670
 before each service com puts the ball 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:23.740
 beyond the service line but 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:25.150
 that's if it can be harder 

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:26.980
 but we are in any case it is under your 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:29.470
 control you can decide to do it 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:30.970
 and all of a sudden you take the 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:33.970
 responsibility it's easier for 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:35.110
 you do not have control and that 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:36.790
 generates a lot less frustration 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:38.230
 because you know why you do not 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:39.970
 do not succeed you know why you 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:43.050
 are doing well and you can 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:45.700
 simply guided in fact 

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:48.100
 calibrated more easily recalibrated when 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:50.140
 you feel lost a match so 

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:52.570
 created your own victory for your 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:55.810
 next match do you say ok I win this 

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:57.160
 match if I wrote you the following in 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:58.660
 depending on the player profile you 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:00.340
 want to develop according to the advice 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:01.720
 of the moment it's going to be a tip you 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:04.570
 have read some tactics a council 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:05.590
 that one of your friends gave you here 

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:07.420
 that's how I started 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:09.700
 tennis i got ok well bah this match 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:12.130
 for me it will be up for grabs if I get to 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:13.030
 recover three times the ball beyond 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:15.900
 services something that has me a lot 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:18.329
 assisted in particular 4th series to 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:19.470
 and spent several rounds because I 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:21.800
 concentrate on it 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:24.419
 rather low regularity so here is 

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:26.699
 here for the fourth series is 

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:29.720
 on it that I will focus but at 

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:32.039
 you define what is your victory 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:33.660
 define it right now even in 

00:04:32.039 --> 00:04:35.610
 comment and if define it is a 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:37.050
 very good exercise to do even if it's 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:39.000
 just for your next match will not be 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:40.770
 necessarily the proof the definition of 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.270
 your victory for the next tournament 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:43.789
 or in a month or in two months but 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:46.639
 in any case for your next match 

00:04:43.789 --> 00:04:47.789
 what is your definition of your 

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:50.250
 victory 

00:04:47.789 --> 00:04:51.810
 create your own victory wrote the 

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:53.310
 just below in comment it's a 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:55.940
 very good exercise to do and one in 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:55.940
 speak again ciao
