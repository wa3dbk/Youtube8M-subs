00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:05.209
 you're very good kids and we 

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:07.640
 here with another video of plates 2 this time 

00:00:05.209 --> 00:00:10.099
 with the diamond paddler and attention 

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:12.230
 because it will get to mark the raid 

00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:15.679
 as I tell you because a hint here and 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:17.869
 he killed 14 fit second third and the 

00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:19.490
 fourth that appears but with tomato and I 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:21.470
 you do the wifi but to the bed 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:23.390
 kids, my mother, yes, the same 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:26.029
 grace did to me when the 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:28.039
 fourth but good to do that I know it will be 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:30.349
 in terrestrial war will take and the xp re 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:32.899
 50 because with a sniper the 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:35.870
 It is very easy when you are here 

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:38.449
 I frame that of the suicide 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:41.149
 suicide just because there was the 

00:00:38.449 --> 00:00:43.070
 frank against two enemies good to 

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:45.079
 from now on what those who are 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:47.360
 place there with the franc to catch 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:49.460
 let's say the 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.560
 this is typical that I know that I am called and 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:55.070
 we are in raid like I said to the 

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:58.700
 principle that said that from 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:00.890
 now mark the war because almost 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:03.260
 all the clips have raid are based on 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:06.670
 that kids that I went with the ballista the 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:09.830
 truth that moved us always is not very 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:12.410
 simple so highlight your great 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:14.720
 result but hey it's a 3812 that I 

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:16.160
 I make a gold match by teams and 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.350
 maui more than half of the casualties me 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:20.270
 alone and also with the franc when 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:24.390
 I also use them a lot 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:27.720
 the gun up to 45 but hey it was 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.280
 and I said to see the first well that first 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.320
 that imply a table that I mention because 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.479
 I was so eager to comment 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.070
 something that I said for the first kings that 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.619
 imply take me out that base from this 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:40.680
 late and this was not what I want 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:44.580
 to comment is to make a versus versus between 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:46.320
 pc and xbox know that yesterday go up uploading 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:48.720
 a boxing from the pc that bought me the 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.030
 I'm really happy and it's about 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.380
 fable and the video has been seen as 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.610
 I will leave in the description for a 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.920
 notation that is quite curious in 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.810
 a boxing or total that I bought from the pc 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.090
 such and I was testing the truth does not touch 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.070
 of this weekend xbox I was 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.920
 testing the white these for pc that 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:07.229
 you know I was free in sting that 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.780
 climbed a track plus stacks team 7 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:12.360
 retweet from one of my tweets stacks the 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:15.690
 by day I like the video is from me 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:18.709
 first game on pc and those that 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:21.150
 youtubers in front of you to volley 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:24.120
 when when someone gives me I like a 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:26.700
 video so that people go back to 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:29.780
 see that you have uploaded that video retweet 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:32.690
 I happened to do it quite funny 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:34.880
 and that was when I pz put him there 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:37.990
 the graphics to the top there are many more 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:41.240
 options I started that in console there is no 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:42.770
 in xbox is not even that textures 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:45.530
 that they were the play good because I started 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:47.860
 there's also that of shadows I do not know 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:51.990
 I do not know how many things 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:55.360
 and total that I put everything to the maximum 

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:56.710
 one thing I like a lot is this I do not know 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:58.750
 what it's called but it gives you 

00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:01.420
 depth to the soul you see the soul from 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:04.300
 I was further back, I've lived 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:05.920
 seen some fish bill to what I 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:07.900
 I mean you see the gun as well as a little 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:09.940
 is more backwards that also what 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:11.620
 you have what you have to customize it in 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:13.330
 the pc and it's pretty good the truth that 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:15.160
 I like to put a little bit of that 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:17.980
 I really was all weekend 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:20.380
 good all weekend trying like this 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:23.800
 some pills talks about pc stuff and I do not 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:27.430
 connection failed even once that is 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:30.519
 is that not even once a host 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:35.859
 not a single one gave me a tie there was not the 

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:38.739
 anger was paradise because this is normal 

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:44.560
 and I was there as a rally of 50 of 60 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:45.700
 such is that quite happy all that what 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:47.129
 bad is that if a bank but good 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:50.109
 I improved quite the weekend with the 

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:53.620
 keyboard and mouse such that today Monday such me 

00:03:50.109 --> 00:03:57.650
 I put xbox to try the changes 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:59.870
 yews every three seconds 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:01.849
 what most impacted me the most 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:04.430
 if at the beginning the graphics tells us 

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:07.069
 that you notice so much the difference of pc to 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:09.379
 the console but I was blown away because 

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:12.650
 I swear at the beginning it was believed that I had 

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:15.019
 the xbox with this connected by the three 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:16.190
 red and white yellow wires and this 

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:18.590
 it can not be what happens if I have it 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:20.539
 here connected with h &amp; m not juren noticed 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:22.550
 an incredible difference and then already from 

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:24.740
 the connection is that I tell you all the 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:27.350
 late with three stripes that I was hitting 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:29.240
 the glasses all the late tip and that's 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:30.560
 changed yews every three seconds I 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:32.090
 I'm better off a lot because then the 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:33.620
 games are not kept whole 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:35.510
 in movie mode 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:37.729
 after I say I'm going to make a comment 

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:41.120
 doing a comparison because it is 

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:44.960
 that really kids if some game what 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:48.110
 I can play I started that guy 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:49.639
 throws to the sea that already for the gem uncle that 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:52.910
 he already pointed so he shot him in all the 

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:54.919
 head and what is being said if 

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:56.750
 can take advantage of playing a game in the 

00:04:54.919 --> 00:04:58.100
 pc I was passing the xbox also not 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:00.110
 you need capturing and with the cucumber 

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:03.710
 he can record what the 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:05.449
 win even crisis 3 I think less 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:08.690
 they have to go through the code of 

00:05:05.449 --> 00:05:11.539
 buy the graphic of the series 7.900 

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:15.020
 they gave you exist and the infiniti and 

00:05:11.539 --> 00:05:16.430
 that goes by code and when you have the 

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:18.169
 code upload some clean because it 

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:20.720
 it has to be already past the graphics 

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:22.930
 that's true, those kids do not 

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:26.810
 I know for my PC lp camille kick that 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:28.130
 console to both play and xbox I do not know what 

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:29.750
 what do you think because after 

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:31.729
 be testing this weekend and you 

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:33.529
 I say good have been my 

00:05:31.729 --> 00:05:36.050
 my comparisons the connection the 

00:05:33.529 --> 00:05:37.550
 graphics is that all kids of the 

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:39.279
 configuration to give to and the 

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:43.279
 deep as he had been very good 

00:05:39.279 --> 00:05:44.870
 I just wanted to say that in the 

00:05:43.279 --> 00:05:46.779
 comments that you have not tried 

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:49.699
 pc well you could not tell me much 

00:05:46.779 --> 00:05:51.100
 but it was good just that for 

00:05:49.699 --> 00:05:53.080
 the video 

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:56.380
 I left the idea that I love you 

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:59.170
 will process so it was not very good but 

00:05:56.380 --> 00:06:04.660
 It was the first thing that had taken me out of the 

00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:06.910
 list to use more the barista than the 

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:09.400
 of that ere I have there as my 

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:10.930
 times the same thing gives me to use the 

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:13.240
 serra saco that the same thing gives me for 

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:15.070
 use the ballista and he has not even 

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:16.330
 given but to the cinema mode in the game as well 

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:20.560
 I gave him but the cinema mode marks you 

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:23.910
 here and how are those of hamas and 

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:25.710
 is saying that by the branches 

00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:27.060
 so now he's giving me to use 

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:30.420
 all ballista the truth that I had a 

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:32.130
 era and that separate me now I'm with 

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:34.230
 the ballista at the top of power I want to 

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:36.120
 quick look so nothing kids 

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:38.670
 it is simply coming to an end 

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:42.690
 gin market in the final and go to the king 

00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:44.760
 kong was the final crumb and making a 

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:47.640
 click now it seems to me that he killed me three 

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:48.690
 and I have to make the death chamber 

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:50.700
 but he fucked me a lot with batista 

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:53.130
 confirm that you already know that this franc 

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:54.870
 if you do not hit him in the fucking head or in the 

00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:59.310
 neck is that they do not charge you if you have 

00:06:54.870 --> 00:07:01.230
 bad connection because you see that they are there 

00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:03.180
 behind this wall 

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:04.590
 this because here I give this fact 

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:06.840
 because that's the fucking cliché in the 

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:08.130
 back and it does not die and here it is already marked 

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:10.320
 in the last sheet and live but fails fucking 

00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:11.520
 fuck kid but I was not I want them 

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:13.110
 what do you think in the comments of 

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:15.150
 some pc test this weekend 

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:16.410
 that was free and all that what 

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:19.460
 reflects is your opinion in the 

00:07:16.410 --> 00:07:22.650
 comments of 38 12 not always very 

00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:24.360
 gameplay arm the kids but I hope 

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:26.430
