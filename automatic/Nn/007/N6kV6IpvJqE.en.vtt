00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
brick outline and you might be asking

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.170 
brick outline and you might be asking
yourself<00:01:06.840> well<00:01:07.320> how<00:01:07.530> is<00:01:07.740> this<00:01:07.920> protective<00:01:08.580> let

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
yourself well how is this protective let

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.370 
yourself well how is this protective let
me<00:01:09.270> show<00:01:09.390> you<00:01:09.420> the<00:01:09.600> outset<00:01:10.340> alright<00:01:11.340> so<00:01:11.729> again

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:12.380 
me show you the outset alright so again

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:15.920 
me show you the outset alright so again
we<00:01:13.380> are<00:01:13.590> as<00:01:13.890> high<00:01:14.340> as<00:01:14.400> we<00:01:14.880> could<00:01:15.060> possibly<00:01:15.090> in

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
we are as high as we could possibly in

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.289 
we are as high as we could possibly in
the<00:01:16.619> air<00:01:16.740> um<00:01:17.869> why<00:01:18.869> is<00:01:18.900> this<00:01:19.080> an<00:01:19.350> advantage

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:20.299 
the air um why is this an advantage

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:23.749 
the air um why is this an advantage
because<00:01:21.799> it's<00:01:22.799> going<00:01:22.979> to<00:01:23.070> be<00:01:23.189> difficult<00:01:23.430> for

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
because it's going to be difficult for

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.240 
because it's going to be difficult for
someone<00:01:24.119> to<00:01:24.390> build<00:01:24.750> blocks<00:01:25.200> all<00:01:25.500> the<00:01:25.920> way<00:01:26.040> up

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
someone to build blocks all the way up

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.670 
someone to build blocks all the way up
and<00:01:26.460> build<00:01:26.670> like<00:01:26.880> a<00:01:26.909> TNT<00:01:27.390> you<00:01:27.509> cannon<00:01:28.080> to<00:01:28.530> hit

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
and build like a TNT you cannon to hit

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.740 
and build like a TNT you cannon to hit
you<00:01:28.860> if<00:01:29.009> you<00:01:29.400> place<00:01:29.610> your<00:01:29.759> claims<00:01:30.030> right<00:01:30.270> but

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
you if you place your claims right but

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.679 
you if you place your claims right but
even<00:01:30.960> if<00:01:31.079> you<00:01:31.170> don't<00:01:32.210> how<00:01:33.210> are<00:01:33.329> they<00:01:33.450> going<00:01:33.600> to

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
even if you don't how are they going to

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:38.539 
even if you don't how are they going to
get<00:01:33.810> in<00:01:33.990> you<00:01:34.890> have<00:01:35.100> obsidian<00:01:35.729> and<00:01:36.200> water<00:01:37.200> and<00:01:37.549> I

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
get in you have obsidian and water and I

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:39.980 
get in you have obsidian and water and I
know<00:01:38.610> for<00:01:38.939> sure<00:01:38.970> no<00:01:39.329> one's<00:01:39.509> going<00:01:39.659> to<00:01:39.689> do<00:01:39.840> my

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
know for sure no one's going to do my

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.630 
know for sure no one's going to do my
lava<00:01:40.229> technique<00:01:40.799> like<00:01:40.950> I<00:01:41.130> showed<00:01:41.310> in<00:01:41.490> how<00:01:41.610> to

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
lava technique like I showed in how to

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.690 
lava technique like I showed in how to
build<00:01:41.909> T&amp;T<00:01:42.240> cannons<00:01:42.720> part<00:01:42.899> 3<00:01:43.229> all<00:01:43.799> the<00:01:44.399> way<00:01:44.490> up

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
build T&amp;T cannons part 3 all the way up

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.130 
build T&amp;T cannons part 3 all the way up
here<00:01:44.970> it's<00:01:45.570> going<00:01:45.780> to<00:01:45.869> be<00:01:45.960> difficult

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
here it's going to be difficult

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.289 
here it's going to be difficult
especially<00:01:46.619> since<00:01:47.310> there<00:01:47.460> is<00:01:47.579> a<00:01:47.610> block<00:01:47.939> limit

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
especially since there is a block limit

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.710 
especially since there is a block limit
which<00:01:48.450> is<00:01:48.630> right<00:01:48.869> about<00:01:49.079> where<00:01:49.920> I'm<00:01:50.100> standing

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:50.720 
which is right about where I'm standing

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:52.969 
which is right about where I'm standing
so<00:01:51.720> no<00:01:51.899> one's<00:01:52.079> going<00:01:52.229> to<00:01:52.259> try<00:01:52.409> to<00:01:52.439> get<00:01:52.680> in<00:01:52.799> here

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
so no one's going to try to get in here

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.910 
so no one's going to try to get in here
it's<00:01:53.880> pretty<00:01:54.149> much<00:01:54.360> invincible<00:01:55.110> no<00:01:55.560> one<00:01:55.710> can

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
it's pretty much invincible no one can

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.770 
it's pretty much invincible no one can
get<00:01:56.070> in<00:01:56.100> at<00:01:56.399> all<00:01:57.590> so<00:01:59.090> again<00:02:00.090> it<00:02:00.299> does<00:02:00.570> take

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
get in at all so again it does take

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.749 
get in at all so again it does take
materials<00:02:01.259> why<00:02:01.500> did<00:02:01.710> I<00:02:01.799> outline<00:02:02.250> it<00:02:02.399> in<00:02:02.520> wool

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
materials why did I outline it in wool

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.490 
materials why did I outline it in wool
because<00:02:03.390> in<00:02:03.600> the<00:02:03.719> daylight<00:02:04.079> when<00:02:04.380> you're

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
because in the daylight when you're

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.620 
because in the daylight when you're
looking<00:02:04.770> up<00:02:04.950> it<00:02:05.130> kind<00:02:05.340> of<00:02:05.520> I<00:02:05.729> mean<00:02:06.000> again<00:02:06.420> you

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
looking up it kind of I mean again you

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.290 
looking up it kind of I mean again you
could<00:02:06.840> move<00:02:07.259> this<00:02:07.469> up<00:02:07.680> here<00:02:08.160> but<00:02:08.310> it<00:02:08.489> makes<00:02:09.149> it

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
could move this up here but it makes it

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.180 
could move this up here but it makes it
look<00:02:09.509> more<00:02:09.539> like<00:02:09.959> a<00:02:10.020> cloud<00:02:10.440> floating<00:02:10.890> in<00:02:11.099> the

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
look more like a cloud floating in the

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.850 
look more like a cloud floating in the
air<00:02:11.720> you<00:02:12.720> will<00:02:12.870> have<00:02:13.050> to<00:02:13.170> put<00:02:13.349> torches

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
air you will have to put torches

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.210 
air you will have to put torches
down<00:02:13.980> there<00:02:14.250> so<00:02:14.520> it<00:02:14.640> doesn't<00:02:15.120> leave<00:02:15.270> a<00:02:15.300> shadow

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
down there so it doesn't leave a shadow

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.370 
down there so it doesn't leave a shadow
um<00:02:17.450> but<00:02:18.450> you<00:02:18.570> know<00:02:18.600> that's<00:02:18.840> not<00:02:18.960> a<00:02:19.020> big<00:02:19.200> deal

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
um but you know that's not a big deal

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:20.750 
um but you know that's not a big deal
people<00:02:19.710> would<00:02:19.920> just<00:02:20.040> be<00:02:20.190> like<00:02:20.220> maybe<00:02:20.490> they're

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
people would just be like maybe they're

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.420 
people would just be like maybe they're
underground<00:02:21.120> or<00:02:21.450> something<00:02:21.840> if<00:02:22.370> they<00:02:23.370> think

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
underground or something if they think

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.700 
underground or something if they think
to<00:02:23.820> look<00:02:23.970> up<00:02:24.180> and<00:02:24.390> they<00:02:24.480> do<00:02:24.540> see<00:02:24.900> you<00:02:25.050> I<00:02:25.230> mean

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
me go back inside now again you can

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.420 
me go back inside now again you can
adjust<00:02:30.990> the<00:02:31.320> model<00:02:31.620> like<00:02:31.770> remember<00:02:32.130> i<00:02:32.160> have

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
adjust the model like remember i have

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.990 
adjust the model like remember i have
three<00:02:32.790> floors<00:02:33.120> inside<00:02:33.660> of<00:02:33.840> this<00:02:34.020> big<00:02:34.680> box<00:02:35.040> you

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
three floors inside of this big box you

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.820 
three floors inside of this big box you
can<00:02:36.180> do<00:02:36.300> one<00:02:36.510> floor<00:02:36.840> you<00:02:37.080> can<00:02:37.110> do<00:02:37.380> a<00:02:37.410> square

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
can do one floor you can do a square

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:40.910 
can do one floor you can do a square
smaller<00:02:38.250> than<00:02:38.520> this<00:02:39.200> you<00:02:40.200> know<00:02:40.320> adjusting<00:02:40.770> to

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
smaller than this you know adjusting to

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.460 
smaller than this you know adjusting to
your<00:02:40.950> claims<00:02:41.780> whatever<00:02:42.780> you<00:02:42.959> want<00:02:43.230> to<00:02:43.290> do

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
your claims whatever you want to do

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:46.340 
your claims whatever you want to do
that's<00:02:44.280> fine<00:02:44.580> but<00:02:44.790> this<00:02:45.720> is<00:02:45.780> the<00:02:46.140> best

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
that's fine but this is the best

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:49.699 
that's fine but this is the best
technique<00:02:46.830> is<00:02:47.040> to<00:02:47.070> build<00:02:47.310> obsidian<00:02:48.030> any<00:02:48.709> kind

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
technique is to build obsidian any kind

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:51.860 
technique is to build obsidian any kind
of<00:02:49.830> inside<00:02:50.190> and<00:02:50.459> flooring<00:02:50.940> you<00:02:51.060> want<00:02:51.270> make<00:02:51.750> it

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
of inside and flooring you want make it

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.110 
of inside and flooring you want make it
obsidian<00:02:52.320> in<00:02:52.440> water<00:02:52.770> on<00:02:52.980> the<00:02:53.100> outside<00:02:53.489> on<00:02:53.760> this

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
obsidian in water on the outside on this

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.020 
obsidian in water on the outside on this
first<00:02:54.330> floor<00:02:54.690> I<00:02:54.930> haven't<00:02:55.560> I<00:02:55.770> also<00:02:56.489> like<00:02:56.760> to<00:02:56.790> do

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
first floor I haven't I also like to do

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:58.520 
first floor I haven't I also like to do
this<00:02:57.180> in<00:02:57.360> the<00:02:57.420> middle<00:02:57.720> of<00:02:57.780> the<00:02:57.870> ocean<00:02:58.020> so<00:02:58.380> that

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
this in the middle of the ocean so that

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:01.220 
this in the middle of the ocean so that
way<00:02:58.680> when<00:02:58.830> I'm<00:02:58.980> up<00:02:59.400> here<00:02:59.940> I<00:03:00.150> can<00:03:00.840> go<00:03:00.930> like<00:03:01.050> this

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
way when I'm up here I can go like this

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.470 
way when I'm up here I can go like this
and<00:03:01.440> drop<00:03:02.010> into<00:03:02.340> the<00:03:02.370> ocean<00:03:02.850> when<00:03:03.120> I<00:03:03.150> want<00:03:03.420> to

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
and drop into the ocean when I want to

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.479 
and drop into the ocean when I want to
get<00:03:03.600> out<00:03:03.660> when<00:03:04.410> I<00:03:04.470> get<00:03:04.560> it<00:03:04.770> want<00:03:05.010> to<00:03:05.070> get<00:03:05.190> in<00:03:05.310> you

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
get out when I get it want to get in you

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:08.510 
get out when I get it want to get in you
know<00:03:05.610> you<00:03:05.670> just<00:03:05.910> do<00:03:06.120> the<00:03:06.270> F<00:03:06.420> home<00:03:07.340> make<00:03:08.340> it<00:03:08.459> a

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:08.520 
know you just do the F home make it a

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:12.920 
know you just do the F home make it a
little<00:03:08.640> bit<00:03:08.820> simpler<00:03:09.239> simpler<00:03:10.580> ok<00:03:11.580> so<00:03:12.209> again

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
little bit simpler simpler ok so again

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.530 
little bit simpler simpler ok so again
we<00:03:13.650> have<00:03:13.860> all<00:03:14.190> this<00:03:14.760> is<00:03:14.940> obviously<00:03:15.120> like

factions<00:03:35.160> that<00:03:35.310> has<00:03:35.670> so<00:03:36.000> many<00:03:36.120> materials

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
factions that has so many materials

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:39.470 
factions that has so many materials
that's<00:03:36.989> unfair<00:03:37.950> you<00:03:38.549> can<00:03:38.730> build<00:03:38.940> a<00:03:39.090> little<00:03:39.360> bit

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
that's unfair you can build a little bit

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.570 
that's unfair you can build a little bit
lower<00:03:39.660> and<00:03:39.989> build<00:03:40.530> a<00:03:40.620> little<00:03:40.769> bit<00:03:40.950> higher<00:03:41.250> up

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:41.580 
lower and build a little bit higher up

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:44.330 
lower and build a little bit higher up
here<00:03:41.880> and<00:03:42.030> make<00:03:42.570> maybe<00:03:42.780> a<00:03:42.870> farm<00:03:43.340> another

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
depending on what do you want to do but

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:51.830 
depending on what do you want to do but
again<00:03:49.769> like<00:03:49.950> I<00:03:50.070> said<00:03:50.100> this<00:03:50.519> is<00:03:50.780> impossible<00:03:51.780> to

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
again like I said this is impossible to

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:55.490 
again like I said this is impossible to
penetrate<00:03:52.760> completely<00:03:53.760> there's<00:03:54.500> absolutely

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
penetrate completely there's absolutely

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:00.770 
penetrate completely there's absolutely
no<00:03:56.489> way<00:03:56.900> someone<00:03:57.900> can<00:03:58.230> get<00:03:58.350> in<00:03:58.500> this<00:03:59.780> unless

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
no way someone can get in this unless

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.710 
no way someone can get in this unless
you're<00:04:01.019> really<00:04:01.350> really<00:04:01.769> stupid<00:04:02.160> and<00:04:02.720> don't

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720 
you're really really stupid and don't

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:06.229 
you're really really stupid and don't
claim<00:04:04.049> anything<00:04:04.350> and<00:04:04.799> they<00:04:05.130> just<00:04:05.310> kind<00:04:05.459> of<00:04:05.640> dig

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:06.239 
claim anything and they just kind of dig

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:07.789 
claim anything and they just kind of dig
it<00:04:06.360> out<00:04:06.450> with<00:04:06.720> an<00:04:06.870> axe<00:04:07.080> but<00:04:07.440> I<00:04:07.470> mean<00:04:07.709> I<00:04:07.769> don't

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:07.799 
it out with an axe but I mean I don't

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:09.490 
it out with an axe but I mean I don't
think<00:04:08.160> anyone's<00:04:08.549> going<00:04:08.700> to<00:04:08.760> be<00:04:08.880> that<00:04:09.090> dumb

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:09.500 
think anyone's going to be that dumb

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:11.630 
think anyone's going to be that dumb
like<00:04:10.500> I<00:04:10.620> like<00:04:10.950> I<00:04:11.070> said<00:04:11.310> there<00:04:11.519> is<00:04:11.610> a

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:11.640 
like I like I said there is a

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:13.430 
like I like I said there is a
three-block<00:04:12.209> limit<00:04:12.540> so<00:04:12.720> no<00:04:12.840> one<00:04:12.989> can<00:04:13.140> do<00:04:13.290> the

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:13.440 
three-block limit so no one can do the

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:16.819 
three-block limit so no one can do the
lava<00:04:13.650> technique<00:04:14.160> i<00:04:14.989> have<00:04:15.989> yet<00:04:16.200> if<00:04:16.440> you<00:04:16.620> guys

00:04:16.819 --> 00:04:16.829 
lava technique i have yet if you guys

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:18.830 
lava technique i have yet if you guys
can<00:04:17.130> think<00:04:17.340> of<00:04:17.459> a<00:04:17.519> way<00:04:17.549> to<00:04:18.180> penetrate<00:04:18.329> this

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840 
can think of a way to penetrate this

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:21.199 
can think of a way to penetrate this
