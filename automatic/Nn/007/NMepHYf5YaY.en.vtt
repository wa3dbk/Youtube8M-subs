00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:29.240 
the shape that you want you could also
use<00:02:26.840> gumdrops<00:02:27.840> that<00:02:28.290> you've<00:02:28.410> flattened<00:02:29.160> with

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
use gumdrops that you've flattened with

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.060 
use gumdrops that you've flattened with
a<00:02:29.310> rolling<00:02:29.730> pin<00:02:29.940> and<00:02:30.320> then<00:02:31.320> cut<00:02:31.590> out<00:02:31.620> the<00:02:31.740> same

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.070 
a rolling pin and then cut out the same

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:39.260 
a rolling pin and then cut out the same
fashion<00:02:34.520> so<00:02:35.520> there's<00:02:35.730> a<00:02:35.760> little<00:02:35.970> foot<00:02:37.760> and<00:02:38.760> you

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 
fashion so there's a little foot and you

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:40.460 
fashion so there's a little foot and you
can<00:02:39.390> do<00:02:39.450> the<00:02:39.540> same<00:02:39.690> thing<00:02:39.900> for<00:02:40.050> the<00:02:40.140> wings<00:02:40.290> so

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
can do the same thing for the wings so

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.010 
can do the same thing for the wings so
you<00:02:40.500> do<00:02:40.709> have<00:02:40.739> alternatives<00:02:41.520> to<00:02:41.790> the<00:02:42.690> candy

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020 
you do have alternatives to the candy

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:44.240 
you do have alternatives to the candy
melting<00:02:43.260> wafers<00:02:43.560> if<00:02:43.680> they<00:02:43.830> don't<00:02:43.980> if<00:02:44.160> you

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
melting wafers if they don't if you

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.590 
melting wafers if they don't if you
don't<00:02:44.280> have<00:02:44.550> those<00:02:44.700> where<00:02:44.940> you<00:02:44.970> live<00:02:47.600> there's

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
don't have those where you live there's

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:49.970 
don't have those where you live there's
a<00:02:48.660> little<00:02:48.870> chick<00:02:49.080> that<00:02:49.230> was<00:02:49.380> with<00:02:49.590> a<00:02:49.620> bigger

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
a little chick that was with a bigger

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:51.860 
a little chick that was with a bigger
cupcake<00:02:50.670> I'm<00:02:50.910> going<00:02:51.180> to<00:02:51.270> show<00:02:51.390> you<00:02:51.450> a<00:02:51.570> couple

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
cupcake I'm going to show you a couple

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.750 
cupcake I'm going to show you a couple
of<00:02:52.080> pictures<00:02:52.230> at<00:02:52.470> the<00:02:52.590> end<00:02:52.620> with<00:02:53.340> a<00:02:53.370> smaller

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
of pictures at the end with a smaller

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.800 
of pictures at the end with a smaller
cupcake<00:02:54.209> I<00:02:54.360> think<00:02:54.570> it<00:02:54.660> looks<00:02:54.810> a<00:02:54.900> lot<00:02:54.989> cuter

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 
cupcake I think it looks a lot cuter

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:59.150 
cupcake I think it looks a lot cuter
there<00:02:57.810> it<00:02:57.930> is<00:02:57.989> the<00:02:58.170> smaller<00:02:58.470> cupcake<00:02:58.890> I<00:02:59.010> don't

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
there it is the smaller cupcake I don't

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:00.199 
there it is the smaller cupcake I don't
if<00:02:59.220> you<00:02:59.280> can<00:02:59.340> tell<00:02:59.550> the<00:02:59.610> difference<00:02:59.940> or<00:03:00.090> not

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
if you can tell the difference or not

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:03.200 
if you can tell the difference or not
but<00:03:00.510> I<00:03:00.540> find<00:03:00.780> that<00:03:00.840> a<00:03:00.900> lot<00:03:00.989> cuter
