and<00:02:02.969> in<00:02:03.060> that<00:02:03.210> case<00:02:03.479> it<00:02:03.689> would<00:02:03.899> fit<00:02:04.229> on<00:02:04.409> this

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
and in that case it would fit on this

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.190 
and in that case it would fit on this
one<00:02:04.979> or<00:02:05.219> this<00:02:05.610> one<00:02:05.670> but<00:02:06.630> then<00:02:06.840> you<00:02:07.049> would<00:02:07.170> have

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
one or this one but then you would have

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.410 
one or this one but then you would have
tend<00:02:07.619> to<00:02:07.710> have<00:02:07.829> a<00:02:07.860> gap<00:02:08.220> because<00:02:08.970> it<00:02:09.119> would<00:02:09.270> be

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
tend to have a gap because it would be

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
quite a bit bigger and rattle around so

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:14.160 
quite a bit bigger and rattle around so
you<00:02:12.330> have<00:02:12.450> to<00:02:12.540> do<00:02:12.690> that
