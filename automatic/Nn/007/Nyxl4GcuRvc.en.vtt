00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:11.340
 hello friends with you karadar my name is 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.500
 Ivan bulls and in today's video review 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.760
 3 car dvrs 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:21.199
 flush mount with remote cameras 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:23.939
 installation thereby separated axioms 

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:29.249
 video recorder car vision 1000 hundred 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:32.490
 Kiev Star St8 Swift and bush rs 9 

00:00:29.249 --> 00:00:35.120
 general principle of these DVRs 

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:38.070
 one we take the camera on the cord 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:40.260
 windshield wire 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.219
 neatly laid under the trim along 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.329
 glass hide it and connect 

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:47.489
 DVR setting it to 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.280
 you can take the glove box 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.390
 special module that will power 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.910
 DVR even have ignition 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:57.539
 off and will not give thereby 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:59.000
 discharge the battery and the first or 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.379
 power box 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.570
 what is the difference between these three 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:07.980
 DVRs they are very similar 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:11.220
 axioms and kew old is it at all 

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:14.300
 almost like the axiom twin brothers in 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.800
 time was copied from cimstar 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:19.340
 the only thing he has is more comfortable 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:23.070
 square case 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:25.140
 He also has a very convenient mount on 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:28.310
 double sided tape for installation in 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:32.450
 the glove box in which he comes in and 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:37.250
 accordingly, it goes great 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:41.630
 the camera is pretty well done in appearance 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:45.600
 even if you compare better than 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:48.600
 kievstar camera appearance here is the wire 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.910
 enough for laying on any 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:55.670
 windshield whether cargo 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:58.190
 car or passenger from the old bows 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:00.930
 the camera looks very similar 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:04.100
 mount less convenient and 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:08.520
 but in no case allows you to set 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:09.600
 DVR glove box known that 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:13.200
 have to 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:16.470
 additionally buy there well take 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:19.200
 double-sided tape to glue itself 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.780
 mount of course he is bundled here 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:25.650
 well, you never know 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:28.550
 here and keemstar st8 swift it is different 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:33.020
 pretty big screen from their colleagues 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:36.140
 here is no unfortunately fasteners for him 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:42.120
 so comfortable as the rest 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:43.950
 fasteners there on reminds installation 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:48.240
 classic DVRs ie 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:51.110
 there is a connector and 3 suckers camera 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:54.750
 also slightly different allows 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:58.860
 bend it hide at all behind the windshield 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:03:02.850
 glass is the same connection is not hdmi 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:08.820
 lace like a bush raw and axiom a 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:13.740
 through yusbi connector here they shoot me more 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:15.410
 I like the way it shoots rs 9 and axiom 

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:19.170
 car vision 1000 100 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:21.740
 Well, the principle of the cross grow February 8, too 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:25.320
 shoots well 

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:27.150
 the difference is like u old and divided in that 

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:27.920
 what does he have in the bundle module 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:31.950
 gps 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:34.410
 This immediately increases its level 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:37.110
 there can record speed 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:40.050
 car locations also set 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:42.780
 threshold that is if you drive for example 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:47.790
 more than 80 he will not record your 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:49.580
 speed thereby exclude your guilt in 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:53.670
 case there if you exceed speed 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:56.940
 here is axioms I like very much his body 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:04:00.600
 fastenings are all very thoughtful and if 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:03.060
 not the absence of DPS I would strictly 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:06.350
 recommended axioms in terms of installation 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:10.680
 because for installation you are much more comfortable 

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:14.550
 than the bush well, well, but basically the quality 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:17.090
 they have similar entries as they write 

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:19.570
 these recorders parallel shooting 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:22.780
 see the link at the end of the video 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:24.970
 you can compare live and if 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:26.530
 video quality is your priority 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:30.730
 accordingly choose your 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:32.770
 DVR also like from like these 

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:34.570
 video recorders are installed examples 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:37.990
 installation in the machines also see in 

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:40.050
 the end of the video link here is set 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:42.940
 looks pretty good 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:44.710
 imperceptibly that is very important that is not 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:47.770
 need to shoot every time u wear them with 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:49.960
 you can only take the block home and 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:52.240
 already on it there look whether to connect 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:57.280
 its to the TV they are all equipped 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:05:04.990
 hdmi connector to play on 

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:07.660
