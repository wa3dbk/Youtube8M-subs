hello<00:00:04.660> I'm<00:00:05.470> Akira<00:00:06.130> Hojo<00:00:06.700> in<00:00:07.390> this<00:00:07.569> video<00:00:07.809> I

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:08.230 
hello I'm Akira Hojo in this video I

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:10.200 
hello I'm Akira Hojo in this video I
would<00:00:08.830> like<00:00:08.950> to<00:00:09.190> introduce<00:00:09.430> the<00:00:09.820> Peruvian

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:10.210 
would like to introduce the Peruvian

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:16.670 
would like to introduce the Peruvian
technique<00:00:10.690> of<00:00:11.520> yellow<00:00:12.520> tea<00:00:12.850> and<00:00:14.460> white<00:00:15.460> tea

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
technique of yellow tea and white tea

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.320 
technique of yellow tea and white tea
basically<00:00:17.680> the<00:00:18.220> proven<00:00:18.670> technique<00:00:19.090> for

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:19.330 
basically the proven technique for

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:22.050 
basically the proven technique for
yellow<00:00:19.570> tea<00:00:19.900> and<00:00:20.140> white<00:00:20.320> tea<00:00:20.590> is<00:00:20.619> the<00:00:20.980> same<00:00:21.220> so

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:22.060 
yellow tea and white tea is the same so

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:28.220 
yellow tea and white tea is the same so
I<00:00:22.619> only<00:00:23.619> use<00:00:23.770> the<00:00:24.220> white<00:00:24.789> tea<00:00:25.090> in<00:00:25.360> this<00:00:25.630> video

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.410 

basically<00:00:29.230> for<00:00:29.560> white<00:00:29.830> tea<00:00:30.100> and<00:00:30.340> yellow<00:00:31.119> tea

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:31.420 
basically for white tea and yellow tea

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:35.219 
basically for white tea and yellow tea
we<00:00:31.990> use<00:00:32.230> a<00:00:32.529> little<00:00:33.460> less<00:00:34.420> temperature<00:00:34.989> than

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:35.229 
we use a little less temperature than

00:00:35.229 --> 00:00:40.559 
we use a little less temperature than
body<00:00:36.129> water<00:00:36.460> I<00:00:37.890> usually<00:00:38.890> use<00:00:39.039> about<00:00:39.069> 85<00:00:39.969> to<00:00:39.999> 90

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:40.569 
body water I usually use about 85 to 90

00:00:40.569 --> 00:00:44.849 
body water I usually use about 85 to 90
degree<00:00:40.929> if<00:00:41.620> I<00:00:41.829> use<00:00:42.539> samishii<00:00:43.539> to<00:00:44.170> cool<00:00:44.469> on<00:00:44.649> the

00:00:44.849 --> 00:00:44.859 
degree if I use samishii to cool on the

00:00:44.859 --> 00:00:47.879 
degree if I use samishii to cool on the
water<00:00:45.120> the<00:00:46.120> temperature<00:00:46.300> may<00:00:46.780> drop<00:00:46.989> too<00:00:47.350> much

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:47.889 
water the temperature may drop too much

00:00:47.889 --> 00:00:51.689 
water the temperature may drop too much
so<00:00:48.489> in<00:00:48.940> this<00:00:49.299> gradient<00:00:49.690> technique<00:00:50.170> I<00:00:50.699> use

00:00:51.689 --> 00:00:51.699 
so in this gradient technique I use

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:54.779 
so in this gradient technique I use
glass<00:00:52.659> pitcher<00:00:52.960> in<00:00:53.319> stage<00:00:53.649> and<00:00:53.979> using<00:00:54.670> this

00:00:54.779 --> 00:00:54.789 
glass pitcher in stage and using this

00:00:54.789 --> 00:00:59.399 
glass pitcher in stage and using this
picture<00:00:55.089> I<00:00:55.569> put<00:00:56.379> on<00:00:56.589> the<00:00:56.709> water<00:00:58.319> for<00:00:59.319> the

00:00:59.399 --> 00:00:59.409 
picture I put on the water for the

00:00:59.409 --> 00:01:01.949 
picture I put on the water for the
quantity<00:00:59.889> of<00:00:59.920> the<00:01:00.190> tea<00:01:00.459> leaf<00:01:00.699> I<00:01:01.059> calculate

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:01.959 
quantity of the tea leaf I calculate

00:01:01.959 --> 00:01:05.390 
quantity of the tea leaf I calculate
according<00:01:02.499> to<00:01:02.619> the<00:01:02.739> volume<00:01:03.100> of<00:01:03.280> the<00:01:03.729> teapot

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
according to the volume of the teapot

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.330 
according to the volume of the teapot
for<00:01:06.400> this<00:01:06.700> teapot<00:01:07.180> the<00:01:07.750> volume<00:01:08.140> is<00:01:08.260> about<00:01:08.770> one

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:09.340 
for this teapot the volume is about one

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.000 
for this teapot the volume is about one
hundred<00:01:09.670> fifty<00:01:09.820> milliliter<00:01:10.480> I<00:01:11.010> divide

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:12.010 
hundred fifty milliliter I divide

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:16.440 
hundred fifty milliliter I divide
hundred<00:01:12.430> fifty<00:01:12.840> milliliter<00:01:13.840> by<00:01:14.280> fifty<00:01:15.280> so<00:01:16.090> for

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:16.450 
hundred fifty milliliter by fifty so for

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.030 
hundred fifty milliliter by fifty so for
this<00:01:16.570> case<00:01:16.980> the<00:01:17.980> tea<00:01:18.280> leaf<00:01:18.490> I<00:01:18.700> need<00:01:18.970> is<00:01:19.240> 100

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
this case the tea leaf I need is 100

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:25.230 
this case the tea leaf I need is 100
50/50<00:01:21.040> eco<00:01:21.790> sorry<00:01:22.720> gram<00:01:23.040> if<00:01:24.040> your<00:01:24.610> teapot<00:01:25.090> is

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:25.240 
50/50 eco sorry gram if your teapot is

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.290 
50/50 eco sorry gram if your teapot is
bigger<00:01:26.400> for<00:01:27.400> example<00:01:27.820> two<00:01:28.000> hundred

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:28.300 
bigger for example two hundred

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:32.330 
bigger for example two hundred
milliliter<00:01:28.690> you<00:01:29.590> have<00:01:29.770> to<00:01:29.980> divide<00:01:30.340> by<00:01:31.050> 50<00:01:32.050> then

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
milliliter you have to divide by 50 then

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.490 
milliliter you have to divide by 50 then
the<00:01:33.340> tea<00:01:33.640> leaf<00:01:33.850> that<00:01:34.030> you<00:01:34.090> need<00:01:34.450> is<00:01:34.840> about<00:01:35.080> foie

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:35.500 
the tea leaf that you need is about foie

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:40.230 
the tea leaf that you need is about foie
gras<00:01:36.480> first<00:01:37.480> of<00:01:37.630> all<00:01:37.920> I<00:01:38.920> have<00:01:39.520> to<00:01:39.730> cool<00:01:40.060> down

gras first of all I have to cool down

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.520 
gras first of all I have to cool down
the<00:01:40.270> water<00:01:40.650> so<00:01:41.650> I<00:01:42.040> pour<00:01:42.520> the<00:01:42.610> water<00:01:43.290> into<00:01:44.290> the

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:44.530 
the water so I pour the water into the
