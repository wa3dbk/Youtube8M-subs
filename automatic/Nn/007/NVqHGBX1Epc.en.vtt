so<00:02:14.220> in<00:02:14.280> a<00:02:14.340> way<00:02:14.459> you<00:02:14.519> can<00:02:14.819> kind<00:02:15.000> of<00:02:15.030> see<00:02:15.180> this

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
so in a way you can kind of see this

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.500 
so in a way you can kind of see this
knife<00:02:15.540> as<00:02:15.780> you<00:02:16.379> know<00:02:16.950> the<00:02:17.159> the<00:02:17.519> merging<00:02:18.120> of

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
knife as you know the the merging of

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.899 
knife as you know the the merging of
those<00:02:18.629> two<00:02:18.840> ideas<00:02:19.019> thus<00:02:20.010> abetting<00:02:20.489> this<00:02:20.760> is

00:02:20.899 --> 00:02:20.909 
those two ideas thus abetting this is

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:22.850 
those two ideas thus abetting this is
very<00:02:21.150> much<00:02:21.360> a<00:02:21.420> Sebenza<00:02:21.900> like<00:02:22.290> knife<00:02:22.530> it's

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860

bokor Excalibur is based on the burger
knives<00:02:45.510> design<00:02:46.079> and<00:02:46.440> that<00:02:46.980> knife<00:02:47.280> is<00:02:47.579> a<00:02:48.060> really

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
knives design and that knife is a really

00:02:53.839 --> 00:02:53.849 
bokor is not so great I didn't like it

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:59.180 
bokor is not so great I didn't like it
as<00:02:53.940> much<00:02:55.519> but<00:02:56.519> this<00:02:57.390> is<00:02:57.629> basically<00:02:58.109> the<00:02:58.440> burger

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
as much but this is basically the burger

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
together and the end result is one heck

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.610 
together and the end result is one heck
of<00:03:08.069> a<00:03:08.489> knife<00:03:08.989> there's<00:03:09.989> a<00:03:10.049> couple<00:03:10.260> of<00:03:10.470> really

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
of a knife there's a couple of really

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:13.369 
of a knife there's a couple of really
cool<00:03:10.739> touches<00:03:11.190> so<00:03:11.730> you<00:03:11.819> can<00:03:11.970> see<00:03:12.180> here<00:03:12.540> that

00:03:13.369 --> 00:03:13.379 
cool touches so you can see here that

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:15.920 
cool touches so you can see here that
the<00:03:13.590> edge<00:03:13.769> of<00:03:14.220> the<00:03:14.400> knife<00:03:14.579> the<00:03:15.060> top<00:03:15.299> spine<00:03:15.780> of

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
the edge of the knife the top spine of

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:17.360 
the edge of the knife the top spine of
the<00:03:16.019> knife<00:03:16.140> is<00:03:16.440> chamfered<00:03:16.799> and<00:03:17.280> that

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
the knife is chamfered and that

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:19.699 
the knife is chamfered and that
chamfering<00:03:17.910> really<00:03:18.720> does<00:03:19.019> a<00:03:19.049> great<00:03:19.260> job<00:03:19.319> of

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
chamfering really does a great job of

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:21.379 
chamfering really does a great job of
being<00:03:19.889> this<00:03:20.010> tipped<00:03:20.310> a<00:03:20.459> really<00:03:20.819> nice<00:03:21.030> point

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:21.389 
being this tipped a really nice point

00:03:21.389 --> 00:03:23.960 
being this tipped a really nice point
it's<00:03:22.200> not<00:03:22.380> so<00:03:22.680> thin<00:03:22.980> and<00:03:23.160> pointy<00:03:23.519> like<00:03:23.700> you

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
it's not so thin and pointy like you

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:25.370 
it's not so thin and pointy like you
know<00:03:24.060> a<00:03:24.090> Kershaw<00:03:24.569> leek<00:03:24.780> where<00:03:25.019> you're<00:03:25.139> worried

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
know a Kershaw leek where you're worried

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:27.500 
know a Kershaw leek where you're worried
about<00:03:25.440> it<00:03:25.650> getting<00:03:25.709> dinged<00:03:26.130> or<00:03:26.370> dented<00:03:26.790> but<00:03:27.419> it

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
about it getting dinged or dented but it

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:29.569 
about it getting dinged or dented but it
is<00:03:27.660> really<00:03:27.870> thin<00:03:28.290> in<00:03:28.739> addition<00:03:29.220> the<00:03:29.340> high

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:29.579 
is really thin in addition the high

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:32.569 
is really thin in addition the high
hollow<00:03:29.940> grind<00:03:30.359> gives<00:03:31.319> you<00:03:31.470> a<00:03:31.530> very<00:03:31.950> thin<00:03:32.400> edge

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:32.579 
hollow grind gives you a very thin edge

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:34.670 
hollow grind gives you a very thin edge
behind<00:03:32.940> the<00:03:33.209> actual<00:03:33.690> cutting<00:03:33.989> bevel<00:03:34.349> making

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
behind the actual cutting bevel making

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.430 
behind the actual cutting bevel making
this<00:03:34.769> knife<00:03:34.980> and<00:03:35.160> a<00:03:35.250> great<00:03:35.700> slicer<00:03:36.450> a<00:03:36.690> couple

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
this knife and a great slicer a couple

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.080 
this knife and a great slicer a couple
of<00:03:37.560> other<00:03:37.709> really<00:03:37.980> nice<00:03:38.160> touches<00:03:38.430> you<00:03:38.760> can<00:03:38.910> see

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
of other really nice touches you can see

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:40.400 
of other really nice touches you can see
right<00:03:39.269> here<00:03:39.299> that<00:03:39.629> there's<00:03:39.959> the<00:03:40.139> tab<00:03:40.379> that

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410 
right here that there's the tab that

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:44.509 
right here that there's the tab that
that<00:03:41.069> uses<00:03:41.579> that<00:03:42.120> engages<00:03:42.540> the<00:03:42.989> lock<00:03:43.919> bar<00:03:44.220> and

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:44.519 
that uses that engages the lock bar and

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:49.129 
that uses that engages the lock bar and
it<00:03:45.090> is<00:03:45.500> absolutely<00:03:46.500> perfectly<00:03:47.190> flush<00:03:48.139> with

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:49.139 
it is absolutely perfectly flush with

00:03:49.139 --> 00:03:50.780 
it is absolutely perfectly flush with
the<00:03:49.290> lock<00:03:49.500> bar<00:03:49.799> there<00:03:50.310> are<00:03:50.400> a<00:03:50.430> couple<00:03:50.579> of

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790 
the lock bar there are a couple of

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:54.559 
the lock bar there are a couple of
places<00:03:50.940> on<00:03:51.900> knives<00:03:52.680> where<00:03:53.549> the<00:03:53.970> lock<00:03:54.239> bar

00:03:54.559 --> 00:03:54.569 
places on knives where the lock bar

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:57.050 
places on knives where the lock bar
interface<00:03:55.290> is<00:03:55.620> not<00:03:56.040> exactly<00:03:56.579> comfortable

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
interface is not exactly comfortable

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.360 
interface is not exactly comfortable
that<00:03:57.269> this<00:03:57.419> is<00:03:57.569> a<00:03:57.599> big<00:03:57.870> gap<00:03:58.139> and<00:03:58.889> it<00:03:59.190> does

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
that this is a big gap and it does

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:01.520 
that this is a big gap and it does
create<00:03:59.549> a<00:03:59.669> hotspot<00:04:00.000> but<00:04:00.569> here<00:04:00.989> this<00:04:01.230> the

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.530 
create a hotspot but here this the

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:03.920 
create a hotspot but here this the
transition<00:04:02.129> is<00:04:02.280> almost<00:04:02.940> seamless<00:04:03.480> it's<00:04:03.690> so

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930 
transition is almost seamless it's so

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:06.349 
transition is almost seamless it's so
tight<00:04:04.199> and<00:04:04.500> so<00:04:05.099> well<00:04:05.340> cut<00:04:05.609> that<00:04:05.760> it's<00:04:05.910> almost

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:06.359 
tight and so well cut that it's almost

00:04:06.359 --> 00:04:08.210 
tight and so well cut that it's almost
seamless<00:04:06.840> and<00:04:07.049> so<00:04:07.169> when<00:04:07.290> it's<00:04:07.440> in<00:04:07.560> your<00:04:07.650> hand

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220 
seamless and so when it's in your hand

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:10.490 
seamless and so when it's in your hand
you<00:04:08.910> can't<00:04:09.180> feel<00:04:09.419> anything<00:04:09.840> it's<00:04:10.410> just

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 
you can't feel anything it's just

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.470 
you can't feel anything it's just
