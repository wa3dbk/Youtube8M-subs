00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
would say because in order for you to be

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.569 
would say because in order for you to be
efficient<00:00:42.719> on<00:00:42.899> the<00:00:42.960> kick<00:00:43.500> yeah<00:00:44.129> you're<00:00:44.370> right

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
efficient on the kick yeah you're right

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.000 
efficient on the kick yeah you're right
you<00:00:44.940> have<00:00:44.969> to<00:00:45.420> have<00:00:45.719> like<00:00:46.379> a<00:00:46.410> little<00:00:46.680> bit<00:00:46.860> of

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
you have to have like a little bit of

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.180 
you have to have like a little bit of
this<00:00:47.430> but<00:00:47.969> if<00:00:48.090> you<00:00:48.210> turn<00:00:48.600> completely<00:00:49.010> then<00:00:50.010> it

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
this but if you turn completely then it

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.580 
this but if you turn completely then it
becomes<00:00:50.489> very<00:00:50.760> awkward<00:00:51.270> on<00:00:51.390> the<00:00:51.420> arm<00:00:51.719> push<00:00:52.050> so

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
becomes very awkward on the arm push so

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.439 
becomes very awkward on the arm push so
it's<00:00:52.770> right<00:00:53.070> in<00:00:53.219> between<00:00:53.250> that<00:00:53.969> you<00:00:54.000> have<00:00:54.300> to

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
it's right in between that you have to

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.200 
it's right in between that you have to
find<00:00:55.320> the<00:00:55.500> comfort<00:00:55.739> zone<00:00:56.010> where<00:00:56.730> you<00:00:56.969> can

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
find the comfort zone where you can

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.360 
find the comfort zone where you can
still<00:00:57.480> arch<00:00:57.719> because<00:00:58.469> if<00:00:58.620> you<00:00:58.739> face<00:00:58.949> straight

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
still arch because if you face straight

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.090 
still arch because if you face straight
forward<00:00:59.820> you<00:00:59.910> can<00:01:00.120> do<00:01:00.270> that<00:01:00.420> right<00:01:00.719> so<00:01:00.989> you<00:01:01.770> go

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
forward you can do that right so you go

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.130 
forward you can do that right so you go
a<00:01:02.309> little<00:01:02.550> bit<00:01:02.760> turn<00:01:03.030> right<00:01:03.449> but<00:01:04.019> the

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
a little bit turn right but the

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.140 
a little bit turn right but the
important<00:01:04.589> thing<00:01:04.650> is<00:01:04.979> to<00:01:05.189> have<00:01:05.220> this<00:01:05.670> position

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
important thing is to have this position

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.539 
important thing is to have this position
when<00:01:06.299> you<00:01:06.420> come<00:01:06.720> to<00:01:06.869> the<00:01:06.960> bottom<00:01:07.220> feet<00:01:08.220> should

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
when you come to the bottom feet should

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.530 
when you come to the bottom feet should
be<00:01:08.610> slightly<00:01:08.760> behind<00:01:09.710> meaning<00:01:10.970> behind<00:01:11.970> the<00:01:12.299> in

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
be slightly behind meaning behind the in

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.340 
be slightly behind meaning behind the in
a<00:01:12.600> vertical<00:01:12.900> line<00:01:13.140> so<00:01:13.500> that<00:01:13.680> you<00:01:13.830> can<00:01:14.070> kick

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:15.350 
a vertical line so that you can kick

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:19.130 
a vertical line so that you can kick
okay<00:01:16.350> so<00:01:16.950> it's<00:01:17.790> important<00:01:18.330> that<00:01:18.360> when<00:01:18.689> they<00:01:19.080> do

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
okay so it's important that when they do

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.920 
okay so it's important that when they do
this<00:01:19.409> swing<00:01:19.770> on<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:20.640> backswing<00:01:21.330> part<00:01:21.659> of<00:01:21.810> it
