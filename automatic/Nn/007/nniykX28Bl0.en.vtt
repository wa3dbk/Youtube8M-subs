00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:50.740 
Chelsea is more playing for Chelsea so

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:53.040 
Chelsea is more playing for Chelsea so
is<00:04:51.100> more<00:04:51.280> something<00:04:51.520> that<00:04:51.820> if<00:04:52.480> they<00:04:52.630> ever<00:04:52.660> came

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:53.050 
is more something that if they ever came

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:55.530 
is more something that if they ever came

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:55.540 
up with the out of the blue it's like

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:57.480
