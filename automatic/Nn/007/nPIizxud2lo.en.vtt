00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:18.890 

the<00:00:14.700> first<00:00:14.940> step<00:00:15.269> is<00:00:15.330> you<00:00:16.260> have<00:00:16.439> to<00:00:17.900> polish

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
the first step is you have to polish

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.890 
the first step is you have to polish
your<00:00:19.080> nails<00:00:19.610> with<00:00:20.610> the<00:00:20.759> first<00:00:21.029> color<00:00:21.419> you<00:00:21.689> have

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
your nails with the first color you have

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.200 
your nails with the first color you have
to<00:00:22.110> do<00:00:22.650> want<00:00:22.890> to<00:00:23.130> blend<00:00:23.689> as<00:00:24.689> I<00:00:25.050> did<00:00:25.289> here<00:00:25.320> and

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:26.210 
to do want to blend as I did here and

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:30.320 
to do want to blend as I did here and
the<00:00:27.210> second<00:00:27.539> step<00:00:27.810> is<00:00:28.079> I<00:00:28.289> will<00:00:28.619> took<00:00:29.009> my<00:00:29.330> my

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
the second step is I will took my my

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.810 
the second step is I will took my my
round<00:00:30.769> makeup<00:00:32.720> sponge<00:00:33.720> I<00:00:34.019> am<00:00:34.410> juicing<00:00:34.820> round

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
round makeup sponge I am juicing round

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.740 
round makeup sponge I am juicing round
one<00:00:36.540> instead<00:00:37.230> of<00:00:37.470> our<00:00:37.769> triangle<00:00:38.250> one<00:00:38.750> because

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
one instead of our triangle one because

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.220 
one instead of our triangle one because
the<00:00:40.620> german<00:00:41.040> one<00:00:41.220> it<00:00:42.150> only<00:00:42.449> have<00:00:42.750> a<00:00:42.780> flat

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
the german one it only have a flat

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.829 
the german one it only have a flat
surfaces<00:00:44.449> so<00:00:45.769> for<00:00:46.769> this<00:00:47.150> technique<00:00:48.150> I<00:00:48.360> need<00:00:48.690> a

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:48.839 
surfaces so for this technique I need a

00:00:48.839 --> 00:00:52.520 
surfaces so for this technique I need a
curved<00:00:49.409> surface<00:00:49.610> so<00:00:50.610> I<00:00:50.640> take<00:00:51.390> my<00:00:51.629> sponge<00:00:52.019> and<00:00:52.379> I

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
curved surface so I take my sponge and I

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.430 
curved surface so I take my sponge and I
will<00:00:52.710> make<00:00:52.920> it<00:00:52.949> curve<00:00:53.489> like<00:00:54.119> this<00:00:54.150> i<00:00:54.809> am

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
will make it curve like this i am

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.729 
will make it curve like this i am
cutting<00:00:55.710> this<00:00:56.070> because<00:00:56.580> if<00:00:56.909> you<00:00:57.299> if<00:00:58.019> you<00:00:58.409> saw

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
cutting this because if you if you saw

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.179 
cutting this because if you if you saw
this<00:00:59.309> kind<00:00:59.729> of<00:00:59.879> a<00:01:00.000> sponge<00:01:00.390> this<00:01:01.350> surface<00:01:01.949> is

00:01:02.179 --> 00:01:02.189 
this kind of a sponge this surface is

00:01:02.189 --> 00:01:05.090 
this kind of a sponge this surface is
not<00:01:02.280> the<00:01:02.699> same<00:01:02.909> like<00:01:03.239> d<00:01:03.780> surface<00:01:04.379> this<00:01:04.949> with

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
not the same like d surface this with

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.320 
not the same like d surface this with
faces<00:01:05.640> is<00:01:05.880> mutter<00:01:06.380> so<00:01:07.380> we<00:01:08.010> need<00:01:08.220> this<00:01:08.670> kind<00:01:09.060> of

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
faces is mutter so we need this kind of

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.690 
faces is mutter so we need this kind of
surface<00:01:09.600> but<00:01:10.140> this<00:01:10.470> space<00:01:10.920> is<00:01:11.130> not<00:01:11.400> enough<00:01:11.820> for

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:13.700 
surface but this space is not enough for

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:19.430 
surface but this space is not enough for
for<00:01:14.700> our<00:01:15.229> effect<00:01:16.229> so<00:01:16.799> I<00:01:17.040> I<00:01:17.490> want<00:01:17.910> to<00:01:18.260> get<00:01:19.260> out

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:19.440 
for our effect so I I want to get out

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:27.190 
for our effect so I I want to get out
the<00:01:21.650> inner<00:01:22.650> surface<00:01:23.130> so<00:01:23.970> i<00:01:24.000> am<00:01:24.210> cutting<00:01:25.400> the

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200 
the inner surface so i am cutting the

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:36.430 
the inner surface so i am cutting the
top<00:01:28.200> of<00:01:28.860> the<00:01:29.130> sponge<00:01:29.550> and<00:01:30.300> i<00:01:30.480> am<00:01:30.630> making

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:36.440 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:40.580 

corpse<00:01:37.440> or<00:01:37.710> face<00:01:38.040> here<00:01:38.790> once<00:01:39.600> I<00:01:39.840> do<00:01:39.900> this<00:01:40.320> I
