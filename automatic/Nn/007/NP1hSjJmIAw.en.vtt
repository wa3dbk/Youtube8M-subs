00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:16.109
 Your horse will defy the laws of 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.400
 the saints guys encourage you with yes yes 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:21.720
 I'm going through a racetrack with a car 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.980
 problem we can not do the guys me 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.430
 Fuck your father 80 billion 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.529
 times and eating my life but for the 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:30.750
 good but I'm going the last round like this 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:34.579
 there will be an eye because in this race 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.579
 you have to be here 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:40.900
 you have to be I have not done then 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:40.900
 Well, you have to do it 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:50.780
 because I said it here as tunnel 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:56.960
 white let's go now yes it's worth it and what 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:01:00.110
 they take the child it seems that we are in the 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:02.030
 paradise that's where the tunnel appears 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:03.140
 from the paradise of the other I say great boy 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:05.350
 for nothing to see if we continue with this 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.259
 race is four laps without gas 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:10.270
 and went to the first one is super far away already 

00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:12.009
 this is going to be show complicated and more 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:14.950
 if I leave the race and more if I do 

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:16.780
 this kind of thing that does not understand them 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:18.880
 nobody, I do not know what I'm doing 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:20.350
 you do not have the truth but that's how it's like 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.570
 gives me that we already have insured the 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:25.240
 last position so the best thing is going to 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:28.240
 be repeat the race is and go to another 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:30.130
 try here I want to tell you how this 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:31.869
 If you are successful, we are here 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:33.430
 time at the racecourse and eye because post 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:35.080
 the race gt adagio but you're crazy 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:37.119
 they are going to do much more because I isolated 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:39.550
 we really brake them all 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:42.009
 we burst out there is wrong we have 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:45.200
 busted I know how many people go not what 

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:50.329
 will get to see the key is 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:51.079
 eye let's burst I will burst 

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:54.229
 they are going to burst 

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:56.439
 please do not please come out of the 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:56.439
 highway 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:04.069
 first he jumped to the first point and this 

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:05.090
 it paints very well today this is this 

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:07.549
 it starts much better than I do 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:09.170
 I imagined the truth, that is, in my best 

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:10.979
 dreams I had imagined a beginning of 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:14.700
 race like this if I take 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:18.420
 That crazy man is that I do not know what you're 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:19.769
 counting but who is telling me how 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.780
 that commission was left and if I do not understand it 

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:23.459
 Real guys, that is, I do not finish 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.319
 understand what I really swear I do not 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:27.180
 I understand I do not understand how sites have 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:28.560
 eaten that male missile but as 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.049
 stripper pulls the cars he puts 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.910
 You 're going to see why I'm running out of 

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:34.560
 first is we have here before the 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:38.810
 first milestone 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.810
 boy is going to burst me 

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:45.099
 let's quiet guys to see if 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:46.299
 I can quickly turn around there 

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:49.510
 I stay behind super camera 

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:52.500
 locked eye even though the I do not get me 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:52.500
 pull a text over here 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:04.340
 raul that sincerely this we have to 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:04.340
 other 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:14.670
 if we achieve 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:15.830
 if we manage to catch the liamos, I'm worth 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:19.050
 I'm going to throw rockets back guys 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:24.510
 there you are, what I think is that it seems 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:26.150
 that does not seem to all that is my only 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:28.320
 opportunity to jump in there and 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:29.970
 have raÃºl right next to him but 

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:31.470
 already after this this is impossible 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:32.790
 true now we will see 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:35.520
 I do not want to burst where the 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:36.330
 rockets I'm going to keep the corridors there 

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:40.590
 is 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:43.080
 It's worth raul is here inside and I hope 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:44.730
 because more drag so much uncle I do not understand 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:46.590
 macho I do not understand anything is locked 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:48.690
 guys mega lock vision to beat 11 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:53.700
 4 man that moment 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:56.100
 I do not understand why but it 's super good 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:58.580
 difficult is it is super difficult we are going to 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:01.860
 let nothing happen have I give it worth if 

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:03.090
 we do not improve the car a little bit here 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:06.950
 you have to turn you have to turn and fall in 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:06.950
 when we have behind we put him there 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:11.630
 well, let's go seconds 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:20.600
 this last lap stirrup to catch is worth 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:25.370
 so I can get in here at least 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:25.370
 nothing 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:33.510
 this possibility is possible guys is 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:35.130
 possible it is impossible for me to be 

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:37.670
 impossible male with this kind of that 

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:37.670
 dragged it swear 

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:43.060
 the penultimate uncles have already passed almost 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:45.670
 of winning the race gave yesterday penultimate 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:49.420
 Whether this is enough enough what 

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:55.390
 comes to be regrettable and we let 

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:56.850
 spend a little bit there is the first one 

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:59.850
 some chance of the mysterious life 

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:59.850
 eye 

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:08.530
 8 

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:12.400
 no little arms of male career because 

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:15.720
 you have to go down effectively we're going to 

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:15.720
 to be fifth or that seems 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:24.940
 eye you eat it good the truth is that 

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:26.680
 impossible for this kind of war 

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:28.000
 it's very difficult one of them has been everything 

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:29.290
 this started secular please let us be the 

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.490
 that porter will lend surrounds under the 

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:33.150
 exception and nothing we put the next 

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:33.150
 goodbye video 

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:50.420
 Y
