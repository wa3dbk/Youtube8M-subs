00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
all I found it interesting that the 12

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.209 
all I found it interesting that the 12
zodiacs<00:00:33.360> couldn't<00:00:33.809> take<00:00:33.989> down<00:00:34.200> that<00:00:34.410> gate<00:00:34.680> but

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
zodiacs couldn't take down that gate but

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.130 
zodiacs couldn't take down that gate but
Natsu<00:00:35.700> smashing<00:00:36.270> and<00:00:36.360> dragging<00:00:36.780> into<00:00:36.930> it

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
Natsu smashing and dragging into it

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.930 
Natsu smashing and dragging into it
could<00:00:37.410> I<00:00:37.620> guess<00:00:37.890> that<00:00:38.100> just<00:00:38.219> goes<00:00:38.309> to<00:00:38.430> show<00:00:38.550> the

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
could I guess that just goes to show the

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.139 
could I guess that just goes to show the
level<00:00:39.570> of<00:00:39.780> ferocity<00:00:40.620> that<00:00:41.309> the<00:00:41.460> Dragons<00:00:41.940> have

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
level of ferocity that the Dragons have

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.030 
level of ferocity that the Dragons have
that<00:00:42.450> smashing<00:00:43.230> one<00:00:43.350> of<00:00:43.469> them<00:00:43.559> into<00:00:43.770> the<00:00:43.890> gate

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
that smashing one of them into the gate

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.560 
that smashing one of them into the gate
was<00:00:44.219> enough<00:00:44.460> to<00:00:44.610> kind<00:00:44.760> of<00:00:44.850> fuck<00:00:45.059> it<00:00:45.210> over<00:00:45.450> and

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
was enough to kind of fuck it over and

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:46.790 
was enough to kind of fuck it over and
shit<00:00:45.750> like<00:00:45.780> that<00:00:45.930> because<00:00:46.440> there<00:00:46.559> wasn't

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
shit like that because there wasn't

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.500 
shit like that because there wasn't
really<00:00:46.860> not<00:00:47.160> some<00:00:47.430> strain<00:00:47.700> it<00:00:48.000> was<00:00:48.120> actually

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
really not some strain it was actually

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.240 
really not some strain it was actually

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
me think to myself while you know the

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.270 
me think to myself while you know the
arc<00:02:24.660> was<00:02:24.900> pretty<00:02:25.260> badass<00:02:25.500> with<00:02:25.950> a<00:02:25.980> lot<00:02:26.160> of

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
arc was pretty badass with a lot of

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:27.830 
arc was pretty badass with a lot of
action<00:02:26.610> with<00:02:26.700> the<00:02:26.790> Dragons<00:02:27.270> in<00:02:27.390> particular<00:02:27.810> I

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.840 
action with the Dragons in particular I
feel<00:02:27.990> the<00:02:28.140> anime<00:02:28.530> made<00:02:29.010> the<00:02:29.250> Dragons<00:02:29.730> look

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
feel the anime made the Dragons look

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:31.670 
feel the anime made the Dragons look
more<00:02:30.060> ferocious<00:02:30.240> and<00:02:30.750> kind<00:02:30.900> of<00:02:30.960> did<00:02:31.200> a<00:02:31.350> better
