00:00:11.699 --> 00:00:14.709
 a Jacob congratulations on your victory in the juniors 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.849
 the researchers after the good result he found a chance further set 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.489
 Barnier 

00:00:22.489 --> 00:00:24.240
 Semiconductors would continue 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.289
 for congratulation place 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:28.739
 as we already hoped for it 

00:00:28.739 --> 00:00:31.269
 but the contract in the UAE 

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:33.930
 but then according to Marquardt 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.130
 Czaja won more wonderfully and that's why that's certainly an issue 

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:40.470
 a bit further ahead, something different 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:44.230
 and I trained a lot for this competition and Pröll again 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:45.310
 much better 

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:47.990
 what to do the last time and 

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:51.490
 is he has the super unfortunate barley because Wickert is supposed to be the only duo 

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:53.060
 can rise 

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:56.390
 I knew the kingdom today if I did 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.390
 all good running because I have to win 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:04.240
 And is that something special again in international comparison? 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:06.530
 a special 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.530
 as if you compare the last one in March 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:12.060
 Above all, one year is missing 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.800
 around adult Axel Noack 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:16.860
 This is the first competition 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.390
 it is followed by David Lama and PDF's Tower of Power 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:25.520
 of course international standard but Martin Walser has been 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.830
 Post is bigger 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:30.830
 Davis I ask what's going on next to the perpetrators 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:32.970
 around 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.410
 Sports also make mistakes 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:40.130
 so dense RGS football plays against Schlierenzauer yes, I also my tip 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:42.590
 I call or still to schools 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:44.310
 but straight to school 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.770
 I have another two years left now 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.920
 to do with nature and 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.920
 Jeserig Boot takes Natal for the Treptower 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:56.690
 and how long Kläger's audience 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:59.690
 I climb since November 2009 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:02.390
 the prequel 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:04.230
 Loud also on the coat 

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:06.160
 Robert Harris also shows that 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:09.369
 Currently, this is not curable Burda dodge 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:12.849
 as the first of the national chamber before he is still more up 

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:16.049
 otherwise the weather was nice 

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:19.099
 we are not even because in August I am the 

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:20.579
 junior world championship 

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:23.999
 That's one of my big goals this year " 

00:02:23.999 --> 00:02:26.999
 to repeat the world champion titles at the Jews 

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:30.909
 then I wish you luck and thanks not 

00:02:30.909 --> 00:02:31.529
 the interview
