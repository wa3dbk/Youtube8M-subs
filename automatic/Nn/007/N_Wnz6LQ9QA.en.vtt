 Let's first peel the artichokes we have removed their bouquet we remove those 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:32.379
 layers 

00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:34.060
 external 

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:37.070
 until we see the yellow color appear we will cut 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.520
 the two ends of the artichoke 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:46.810
 and we are going to introduce them in a bowl with ice water and a little juice 

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:51.250

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:19.440
 of laps 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:23.320
 We do not seek this conflict but we seek to release all its flavor 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:29.350
 that's why we do not stop doing it well and now we're going to express 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:32.350
 with corn flour this white wine we dilute it 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.660
 and we will add it 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:38.420
 to the pan more or less 1 tablespoon soup half a glass of white wine 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:41.570
 we add it and if necessary 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:44.910
 that is less thick we can add the water of the cooking of the 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:45.850
 artichokes 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:50.159
 if it is not very bitter or water better to look at a little bit of mineral water 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:57.310
 and when we have that sauce pointed we add the cooked artichokes 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:01.980
 that we have cut them to quarters and put them down a little bit we only have left 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:07.240
 place and serve and that is our recipe for which we need 12 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:08.579
