00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:09.090

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.800
 with free and welcome to another video and 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.900
 today people who would say bringing you 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.089
 a series of that chubby but how there is 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:18.270
 five animations that the game neither launched 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:20.250
 still the staff and since a lot of 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.830
 people got to know what the board 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.779
 much later later after having 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:28.289
 started as soon as our case was created 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:30.390
 I wrapped up talking but I know that many 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:33.000
 of you do not know several the first 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.320
 Play then whatever my idea 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.420
 in this series that I want to bring 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.040
 I need you here for me 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.860
 I just want to show you 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:44.879
 all the news from the beginning of what 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:46.140
 the word yes all then from upe date 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:49.079
 the first since he announced 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.250
 is doing that borges was on the 8th of 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:54.180
 June 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.890
 if I'm not mistaken of 2011 then it was the 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.230
 from there he began to do what the 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:01.590
 word he has the first president 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:05.070
 saying that what he wanted to do was 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:07.560
 a live 3d game based on vox and such 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.970
 what was one more hobby with him? 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.320
 also has a gameplay 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.210
 I'll leave it for you to take a look. 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.229
 in gameplay also left some 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.090
 screenshots 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.860
 then it was from there that the 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.090
 keyboard development and I want to 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.369
 to show you are the people who 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.140
 arrived a little later is how it is 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.700
 the fat was at the beginning and any 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.119
 difference from there in the beginning to 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.740
 difference to comment on today having 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.890
 It's basically I want to do this series. 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:34.110
 and I count on the support of you and the person 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.790
 the price is not saying much 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.640
 tiring neither for me nor for you 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.590
 listen I'm going to make a video containing 6 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.060
 the beauty tire there are no houses every 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.619
 video of this series 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.119
 there will be six rights there was not 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:48.200
 tiring neither for you 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:50.460
 much less to me as though beauty O 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:53.030
 So, like I already told you to 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:56.130
 The keyboard's first time came out in the day 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:58.049
 June 8, 2011 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.909
 and then he left several at 20 o'clock 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:01.860
 vacancies I say think six or seven 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:03.570
 sprint hours for us also left me 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.079
 play nothing much just showing up for 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.000
 we 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:09.300
 the project of what he wanted to do with 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.540
 that word there already after he added 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.730
 third person mode on the board 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.290
 in woking gordy basically at the beginning 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:18.379
 was meant to be a first person game 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:20.180
 a first person rpg giving the 

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:22.959
 example of skype in many of you 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:25.040
 should then know a way to adjust 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:26.719
 between first and third person also 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.250
 It would be just like skype you use 

00:02:26.719 --> 00:02:31.390
 rolling mouse forward to backward 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:35.269
 to zoom out zoom in and zoom out 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:36.530
 to be able to change from 1st to 3rd person then 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:40.459
 was basically the second 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:42.560
 President, nothing very big until then. 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:44.299
 already after they have added a video 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.200
 showing a multiplayer mode than 

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:47.060
 gordy 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.709
 yes finally multiplayer mode had 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:50.599
 been advertised a lot of people liked the 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:52.370
 surprising because it is a game that 

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:54.230
 seemed promising to add the 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:54.980
 multiplayer was a large balcony of 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:56.419
 men 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.310
 so people started to lend 

00:02:56.419 --> 00:03:01.970
 more and more austral attention 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:03.889
 The board project is later a 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:05.239
 I think neither the psychic nor the 

00:03:03.889 --> 00:03:07.609
 Right, he 's important to us. 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:10.129
 Also new screenshots that you're not 

00:03:07.609 --> 00:03:12.019
 seeing it in the background then every time I 

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:14.060
 talk about the update I'll probably go 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:15.859
 leave for you to bottom screenshot or 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:17.949
 video that reinforced during happy day 

00:03:15.859 --> 00:03:21.109
 there it is better for you to stand 

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:23.329
 still the president even in that same 

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:25.280
 week he added the facebook than 

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:28.190
 bite that I think some you should already 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:30.620
 know if you access his blog and 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:31.940
 later and selecting what word 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:33.709
 vox your publisher 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:36.079
 If you voted for the first opinions 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:39.199
 that word lets you see that the faces of 

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:41.359
 characters will be something smooth was the two 

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:43.099
 little eyes there on a smooth surface 

00:03:41.359 --> 00:03:45.919
 so that leaving it to put 

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:47.569
 2011 a new vote editor who is 

00:03:45.919 --> 00:03:49.400
 making a whole three-dimensional face 

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:52.010
 So I think I 'm really cool. 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:53.479
 Is the hair quite different from the face? 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:55.549
 It is quite different if you are a note 

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:58.669
 in today's children is already 

00:03:55.549 --> 00:03:59.930
 different then you can see that the 

00:03:58.669 --> 00:04:02.419
 football is constantly changing 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:03.949
 constant update course that I 

00:04:02.419 --> 00:04:06.799
 I always try to keep you as long as I can. 

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:09.049
 informed possible possible possible 

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:10.340
 I do not know about what board I think 

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:11.870
 It's cool for you to know 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:13.729
 what is happening with the game since 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:15.169
 He does not pitch soon, I 'm waiting there. 

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:17.419
 long time the game as well as many of 

00:04:15.169 --> 00:04:20.690
 Are you also next? 

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:21.469
 update there already after they have added 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:23.810
 for us 

00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:24.790
 new three dÃ©s price you are not seeing 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:27.430
 What did you teach? 

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:28.660
 a little girl a young lady and also the 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:30.970
 old man who has hardly been 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:31.750
 used only as an npc for 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:34.330
 creches 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:36.490
 already the female character will give 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:38.020
 to play is obvious nobody has called any 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:39.280
 woman I think most of the 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:41.590
 women like to play with characters 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:43.870
 fgc female not sure if 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:45.580
 You girl and see the videos. 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:47.440
 I do not know if there are many boys coming 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:49.570
 the videos but you watched the videos 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:51.790
 please tell us in the comments if 

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:54.040
 you play it named a rpg or be with the 

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:56.140
 female or male character 

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:57.730
 I know there are people who are very expensive. 

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:59.590
 who likes to play female character 

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:01.750
 No problem with this. 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:05.860
 and then it was operated upon is one 

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:08.500
 female character is the normal affection 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:10.930
 the old man and an orc you'll see in the 

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:13.090
 Onu discusses from below who is 

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:14.950
 using some kind of magic then there 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:17.890
 you can see that the oil from the farm 

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:19.960
 a spell scheme that was only defined 

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:21.100
 Let's say it in the pin because more 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:23.910
 forward that I think most of 

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:26.770
 You already saw in my channel, beauty. 

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:28.810
