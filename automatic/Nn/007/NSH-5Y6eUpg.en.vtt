00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.250
 hello that such youtubers welcome to a 

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:06.900
 new video tutorial 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.389
 today we are going to talk about the 

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:11.840
 tools necessary for the service 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.640
 technical notebook 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:15.260
 but before going into matter I want 

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:17.150
 invite them to follow us in our 

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:20.510
 social networks twitter facebook google + 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:23.420
 and there's also skype 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:26.330
 so that they are there pending of the 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:29.689
 new videos manual courses and others 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:31.820
 things that we are uploading to the network as well 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:33.830
 that at the bottom of the video are 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:37.300
 online to follow us in our 

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:37.300
 social networks 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:44.199
 well we will need for the service 

00:00:40.539 --> 00:00:46.719
 notebook repair a clamp 

00:00:44.199 --> 00:00:49.750
 call brussels antistatic 

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:52.440
 I want to tell you once and for all that 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:57.220
 tools that we are going to get 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:01:00.790
 they have to be anti static so they do not 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:02.710
 we damage any component in our 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:05.140
 laptop since there are some circuits there 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:08.170
 integrated and among other components 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:11.150
 electronic devices that are very sensitive to 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:14.060
 anti static current 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:15.080
 so if we can get all 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.630
 our tool with that 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:21.189
 much better feature 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:21.189
 there we have the tweezers 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:26.229
 open to accommodate different parts of 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:28.960
 our laptop also a scalpel that 

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:31.180
 will help us to uncover some 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.409
 holes that bring a very plastic 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:34.780
 thin 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:39.369
 in our notebook or to make cuts 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:42.670
 very fine also a good kit 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:45.490
 screwdrivers among greater variety 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:47.770
 have this much better since in the 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:49.959
 laptop we will not find only one 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:52.990
 type of screwdrivers but they are going to 

00:01:49.959 --> 00:01:56.500
 there are different types many times that 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:58.959
 be of agÃ¼er according to the brand can 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:03.759
 be that hp do not use the same screws 

00:01:58.959 --> 00:02:05.799
 than a laptop or a laptop or brand of 

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:09.009
 him so the more variety he has 

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:13.090
 Our screwdriver box is much 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:16.680
 better these that are with magnetized tip 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:16.680
 and also antistatic 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.810
 there we can see a use kit 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:24.470
 general is a type of developers or 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:26.710
 levers that will serve us for 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:30.730
 different 

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:35.200
 processes regarding the laptop a good 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:37.510
 soldering with its base since many times 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:40.030
 we only buy the soldering iron but what 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:44.460
 more advisable is that it has its base 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:44.460
 We can buy it or we can make it 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:49.400
 and so we will avoid accidents since 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:52.220
 this soldering iron as you know 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:54.090
 it heats at a fairly high temperature with its 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:58.010
 cleaner 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:58.010
 and a welding station 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:07.240
 that will allow us to weld and weld 

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:09.880
 by entities type s md 

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:15.690
 we must therefore be very careful since 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:15.690
 it is a team that is going to expel air 

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:21.520
 very high temperatures so at 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:26.870
 when we use them we should have 

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:29.269
 very careful a welding station 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:31.810
 and for a more advanced level it is also 

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:31.810
 necessary 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:41.760
 an infrared vga type welder 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:45.120
 this is what we are going to do 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:47.549
 re worth more than everything is going to use this 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:50.720
 piece is very expensive so most do not 

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:53.750
 they use it but if we can have it then 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:53.750
 better 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:04:01.120
 different types of tape needed in 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:04.120
 our in our service to the 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:08.349
 notebook especially this color 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:10.900
 metallic that is reflector since it is the 

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:15.580
 We can use in the parts where they are 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:19.600
 the lcd screen with the lamp ccf l 

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:22.870
 because she is going to reflect the light of 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:26.910
 these so it's not going to overshadow it but 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:26.910
 it will reflect 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:36.120
 a coffee or a box for records 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:38.750
 the greatest variety that we can and sata 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:41.639
 to work with hard drives 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:44.510
 an external unit is also necessary 

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:47.270
 to divide since many times 

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:50.660
 10-inch equipment does not bring 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:53.960
 unit with another in unit of divide and 

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:57.250
 because we need to have our unit of 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:57.250
 external life 

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:00.070
 as well 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:07.590
 an antistatic blanket there we go to 

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:14.360
 work with the board of our 

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:14.360
 notebook and an anti-static handle this 

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:19.849
 we will also need some gloves 

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:23.569
 special 

00:05:19.849 --> 00:05:25.729
 anti static you can see it there in the 

00:05:23.569 --> 00:05:28.610
 image to manipulate 5 without any 

00:05:25.729 --> 00:05:34.169
 inconvenience in the internal part of 

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:37.259
 our notebook we can also 

00:05:34.169 --> 00:05:39.320
 we must have because we are going to 

00:05:37.259 --> 00:05:42.950
 need 

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:45.830
 different types of liquid spray in 

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:49.580
 this case isopropyl alcohol 

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:52.940
 cleaning foam to give a touch of 

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:55.460
 final to compressed air equipment for 

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:57.780
 clean in some places where not 

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:59.940
 we can enter 

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:03.600
 to clean very well then let's 

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:06.110
 use compressed air a clean 

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:06.110
 screens 

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:13.890
 and a clean contacts so there are several 

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:17.670
 necessary things to give you a good 

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:20.960
 service to any kind of new and 

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:24.259
 finally a clip to open 

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:27.020
 the reading units I decided or divided 

00:06:24.259 --> 00:06:29.180
 depending on the type of laptop good 

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:31.520
 friends this have been the tools 

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:35.750
 what we need for the work of 

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:37.250
 notebook repair so I hope 

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:39.819
 the video has served them 

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:43.039
 liked any comment any question 

00:06:39.819 --> 00:06:46.330
 in the comments and thanks for watching 

00:06:43.039 --> 00:06:46.330
 and see you in the next
