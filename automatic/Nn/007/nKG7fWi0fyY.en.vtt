00:00:46.619 --> 00:00:46.629 
my other Norinco JW 15 because this is

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:49.680 
my other Norinco JW 15 because this is
the<00:00:46.839> compact<00:00:47.589> or<00:00:47.920> hiker<00:00:48.129> version<00:00:48.640> as<00:00:48.790> you<00:00:49.540> can

the compact or hiker version as you can
see<00:00:49.989> the<00:00:50.199> barrel<00:00:50.379> is<00:00:50.710> quite<00:00:51.040> short<00:00:51.479> this<00:00:52.479> is<00:00:52.540> a

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:53.049 
see the barrel is quite short this is a

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:56.759 
see the barrel is quite short this is a
rifle<00:00:53.320> that<00:00:53.500> comes<00:00:53.769> with<00:00:53.979> a<00:00:54.010> factory<00:00:55.559> 13<00:00:56.559> inch

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:02.030 
barrel as opposed to the 24 inch barrel
which<00:00:59.979> is<00:01:00.100> on<00:01:00.250> my<00:01:00.460> full-length<00:01:01.119> rifle<00:01:01.479> so

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:02.040 
which is on my full-length rifle so

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:05.369 
which is on my full-length rifle so
let's<00:01:03.040> have<00:01:03.129> a<00:01:03.220> bit<00:01:03.339> of<00:01:03.400> a<00:01:03.489> look<00:01:03.549> at<00:01:03.670> it<00:01:04.110> and<00:01:05.110> as

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:05.379 
let's have a bit of a look at it and as

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:06.810 
let's have a bit of a look at it and as
I<00:01:05.409> mentioned<00:01:05.830> this<00:01:05.890> is<00:01:05.950> basically<00:01:06.520> the<00:01:06.640> same

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:06.820 
I mentioned this is basically the same

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:11.190 
I mentioned this is basically the same
rifle<00:01:07.270> as<00:01:08.729> my<00:01:09.729> other<00:01:09.909> JW<00:01:10.420> 15<00:01:10.780> with<00:01:11.080> the

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:11.200 
rifle as my other JW 15 with the

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.700 
rifle as my other JW 15 with the
exception<00:01:11.590> of<00:01:11.710> the<00:01:11.950> short<00:01:12.430> barrel<00:01:13.409> as<00:01:14.409> you<00:01:14.590> can

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:14.710 
exception of the short barrel as you can

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:17.460 
exception of the short barrel as you can
see<00:01:14.890> the<00:01:15.040> barrel<00:01:15.780> stops<00:01:16.780> just<00:01:17.080> a<00:01:17.170> couple<00:01:17.350> of

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:17.470 
see the barrel stops just a couple of

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:22.100 
see the barrel stops just a couple of
inches<00:01:17.620> ahead<00:01:18.190> of<00:01:18.310> the<00:01:18.460> fore<00:01:19.240> end<00:01:19.830> and

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
inches ahead of the fore end and

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.680 
inches ahead of the fore end and
strangely<00:01:23.110> enough<00:01:23.910> they<00:01:24.910> have<00:01:25.180> decided<00:01:25.510> to

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:25.690 
strangely enough they have decided to

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:30.480 
strangely enough they have decided to
use<00:01:25.810> the<00:01:26.350> very<00:01:27.040> same<00:01:27.130> sights<00:01:28.860> on<00:01:29.860> this<00:01:30.280> rifle

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:30.490 
use the very same sights on this rifle

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:35.030 
use the very same sights on this rifle
as<00:01:31.260> they<00:01:32.260> did<00:01:32.470> on<00:01:32.740> the<00:01:33.010> full-length<00:01:33.250> one<00:01:33.990> and

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
as they did on the full-length one and

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.570 
as they did on the full-length one and
that<00:01:36.040> leads<00:01:36.340> to<00:01:36.490> a<00:01:37.980> little<00:01:38.980> bit<00:01:39.159> of<00:01:39.250> difficulty

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:39.580 
that leads to a little bit of difficulty

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:43.530 
that leads to a little bit of difficulty
with<00:01:39.850> the<00:01:39.940> sight<00:01:40.150> picture<00:01:42.270> let's<00:01:43.270> have<00:01:43.390> a<00:01:43.450> look

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:43.540 
with the sight picture let's have a look

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:45.660 
with the sight picture let's have a look
at<00:01:43.630> the<00:01:43.690> other<00:01:43.810> side<00:01:44.190> here<00:01:45.190> we<00:01:45.220> have<00:01:45.340> a<00:01:45.430> look<00:01:45.550> at

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:45.670 
at the other side here we have a look at

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:47.670 
at the other side here we have a look at
the<00:01:45.790> left-hand<00:01:46.210> side<00:01:46.450> of<00:01:46.780> the<00:01:46.870> carbine<00:01:47.260> or<00:01:47.290> the

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:47.680 
the left-hand side of the carbine or the

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:52.350 
the left-hand side of the carbine or the
compact<00:01:48.460> version<00:01:48.550> and<00:01:49.800> as<00:01:50.800> I<00:01:50.890> mentioned<00:01:51.360> it

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:52.360 
compact version and as I mentioned it

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:57.180 
compact version and as I mentioned it
shares<00:01:52.659> the<00:01:52.780> very<00:01:53.140> same<00:01:53.380> sights<00:01:55.979> with<00:01:56.979> the

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:57.190 
shares the very same sights with the

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:59.850 
shares the very same sights with the
rifle<00:01:57.520> version<00:01:58.140> and<00:01:59.140> this<00:01:59.290> is<00:01:59.470> a<00:01:59.500> little<00:01:59.770> bit

00:01:59.850 --> 00:01:59.860 
rifle version and this is a little bit

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:02.880 
rifle version and this is a little bit
of<00:01:59.950> a<00:02:00.010> problem<00:02:00.280> because<00:02:01.320> when<00:02:02.320> you<00:02:02.440> use<00:02:02.680> that

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:02.890 
of a problem because when you use that

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:08.520 
of a problem because when you use that
big<00:02:02.950> of<00:02:03.370> a<00:02:03.549> foresight<00:02:04.330> blade<00:02:06.900> that<00:02:07.900> close<00:02:08.289> to

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.530 
big of a foresight blade that close to

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:10.859 
big of a foresight blade that close to
the<00:02:08.619> rear<00:02:08.799> sight<00:02:09.090> it<00:02:10.090> doesn't<00:02:10.420> leave<00:02:10.539> much

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:10.869 
the rear sight it doesn't leave much

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:12.990 
the rear sight it doesn't leave much
room<00:02:11.170> for<00:02:11.409> light<00:02:12.310> on<00:02:12.459> either<00:02:12.549> side<00:02:12.819> of<00:02:12.849> the

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
room for light on either side of the

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.660 
room for light on either side of the
sight<00:02:13.209> and<00:02:13.620> as<00:02:14.620> a<00:02:14.680> result<00:02:15.010> you<00:02:15.159> end<00:02:15.310> up<00:02:15.459> with<00:02:15.640> a

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
sight and as a result you end up with a

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.570 
sight and as a result you end up with a
sight<00:02:15.909> picture<00:02:16.239> which<00:02:16.450> is<00:02:16.480> reminiscent<00:02:16.959> of

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
sight picture which is reminiscent of

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.910 
sight picture which is reminiscent of
more<00:02:18.580> like<00:02:18.730> a<00:02:18.760> handgun<00:02:19.239> than<00:02:19.450> a<00:02:19.480> rifle<00:02:19.920> the

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
more like a handgun than a rifle the

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.720 
more like a handgun than a rifle the
sight<00:02:21.159> radius<00:02:21.370> is<00:02:21.760> only<00:02:22.060> about<00:02:23.159> 8<00:02:24.159> inches<00:02:24.430> or

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
sight radius is only about 8 inches or

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:26.340 
sight radius is only about 8 inches or
so<00:02:24.909> maybe<00:02:25.569> a<00:02:25.719> little<00:02:25.870> better<00:02:26.049> than

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:26.350 
so maybe a little better than

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:30.030 
so maybe a little better than
but<00:02:26.650> not<00:02:26.800> much<00:02:27.010> more<00:02:27.810> so<00:02:28.810> it<00:02:29.020> makes<00:02:29.230> precision

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
but not much more so it makes precision

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.390 
but not much more so it makes precision
aiming<00:02:30.220> a<00:02:30.460> little<00:02:30.580> difficult<00:02:31.090> you<00:02:32.280> might<00:02:33.280> be

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
aiming a little difficult you might be

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.550 
aiming a little difficult you might be
asking<00:02:33.880> why<00:02:34.480> have<00:02:34.780> something<00:02:35.140> this<00:02:35.290> short

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
asking why have something this short

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.810 
asking why have something this short
well<00:02:36.960> because<00:02:37.960> I<00:02:38.110> can<00:02:38.230> get<00:02:38.380> one<00:02:38.670> no<00:02:39.670> other

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:39.820 
well because I can get one no other

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:42.120 
well because I can get one no other
reason<00:02:40.210> I<00:02:40.440> just<00:02:41.440> thought<00:02:41.530> it<00:02:41.650> was<00:02:41.710> cool<00:02:41.920> to

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.130 
reason I just thought it was cool to

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:46.500 
reason I just thought it was cool to
have<00:02:42.190> something<00:02:42.520> that<00:02:43.290> compact<00:02:44.430> and<00:02:45.430> I<00:02:46.420> know

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
have something that compact and I know

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:47.760 
have something that compact and I know
most<00:02:46.750> of<00:02:46.810> the<00:02:46.900> people<00:02:46.990> watching<00:02:47.290> this<00:02:47.530> will<00:02:47.710> be

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:47.770 
most of the people watching this will be

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:50.970

24 inch barrel legally it is exactly the
same<00:03:16.350> because<00:03:17.350> it's<00:03:17.680> got<00:03:17.830> an<00:03:17.920> overall<00:03:18.160> length

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:18.490

just<00:03:47.410> trying<00:03:47.590> to<00:03:47.650> see<00:03:47.740> if<00:03:47.770> I<00:03:47.950> can<00:03:48.100> demonstrate

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400 
just trying to see if I can demonstrate

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:52.050 
just trying to see if I can demonstrate
the<00:03:49.000> sight<00:03:49.360> picture<00:03:50.640> with<00:03:51.640> this<00:03:51.790> little

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:52.060 
the sight picture with this little

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:58.880 
the sight picture with this little
compact<00:03:52.480> norinko<00:03:52.990> 22<00:03:54.750> as<00:03:55.750> you<00:03:55.870> can<00:03:55.990> tell

00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:58.890 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:02.550 

hopefully<00:04:00.480> the<00:04:01.480> sight<00:04:01.720> picture<00:04:01.870> gets<00:04:02.230> kind<00:04:02.500> of

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:02.560 
hopefully the sight picture gets kind of

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:10.910 
hopefully the sight picture gets kind of
course

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:10.920 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:13.070 

because<00:04:11.700> of<00:04:11.850> the<00:04:11.970> fact<00:04:12.120> that<00:04:12.300> the<00:04:12.480> front<00:04:12.840> sight

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:13.080 
because of the fact that the front sight

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:14.780 
because of the fact that the front sight
blade<00:04:13.350> is<00:04:13.500> the<00:04:13.590> same<00:04:13.800> size<00:04:14.069> and<00:04:14.280> the<00:04:14.370> carbine

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 
blade is the same size and the carbine

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:18.680 
blade is the same size and the carbine
as<00:04:14.970> it<00:04:15.090> is<00:04:15.209> on<00:04:15.510> the<00:04:15.720> rifle<00:04:17.180> it<00:04:18.180> just<00:04:18.480> about

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690 
as it is on the rifle it just about

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:29.680 
as it is on the rifle it just about
completely<00:04:19.170> fills<00:04:19.410> up<00:04:19.970> the<00:04:20.970> rear<00:04:21.180> sight<00:04:21.450> notch

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:29.690 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:31.480 

there's<00:04:30.290> a<00:04:30.380> pretty<00:04:30.530> good<00:04:30.710> demonstration<00:04:31.010> of

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:31.490 
there's a pretty good demonstration of

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:33.400 
there's a pretty good demonstration of
how<00:04:31.910> little<00:04:32.180> light<00:04:32.420> is<00:04:32.630> left<00:04:32.870> on<00:04:33.020> each<00:04:33.110> side<00:04:33.380> of

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:33.410 
how little light is left on each side of

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:36.520 
how little light is left on each side of
the<00:04:33.530> front<00:04:33.710> paw<00:04:33.920> sight<00:04:34.310> post<00:04:35.440> either<00:04:36.440> the

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:36.530 
the front paw sight post either the

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:38.530 
the front paw sight post either the
front<00:04:36.770> sight<00:04:36.950> post<00:04:37.130> needs<00:04:37.430> to<00:04:37.580> be<00:04:37.700> thinned

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:38.540 
front sight post needs to be thinned

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:40.900 
front sight post needs to be thinned
quite<00:04:38.870> a<00:04:38.900> bit<00:04:39.110> or<00:04:39.260> the<00:04:39.620> rear<00:04:39.800> sight<00:04:40.100> notch

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:40.910 
quite a bit or the rear sight notch

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:44.670 
quite a bit or the rear sight notch
needs<00:04:41.330> to<00:04:41.480> be<00:04:41.600> opened<00:04:42.110> up<00:04:42.230> considerably<00:04:42.710> I

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:44.680 
needs to be opened up considerably I

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:47.740 
needs to be opened up considerably I
think<00:04:45.680> I<00:04:45.740> prefer<00:04:46.100> a<00:04:46.340> smaller<00:04:47.000> front<00:04:47.540> sight

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:47.750 
think I prefer a smaller front sight

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:50.470 
think I prefer a smaller front sight
make<00:04:48.140> it<00:04:48.260> a<00:04:48.290> little<00:04:48.410> easier<00:04:48.590> to<00:04:49.420> get<00:04:50.420> a

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:50.480 
make it a little easier to get a

make it a little easier to get a
precision<00:04:50.810> aiming<00:04:51.200> point<00:04:51.740> on<00:04:51.950> the<00:04:52.010> target

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:00.020 
and the compact side-by-side you can see

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:02.500

the bottom rifle has a scope on it and
I've<00:06:02.600> left<00:06:02.840> the<00:06:03.370> compact<00:06:04.370> or<00:06:04.580> backpacker
