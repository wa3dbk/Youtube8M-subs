00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:33.700 
diminished and they're even more so

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.190 
diminished and they're even more so

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:37.070 
like a little stamp where the laser has

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:38.110 
like a little stamp where the laser has
been<00:03:37.220> you<00:03:37.310> can<00:03:37.370> see<00:03:37.580> these<00:03:37.670> little<00:03:37.820> red

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:38.120 
been you can see these little red

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:49.580 
now in that eye I've now used seven

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:51.220 
now in that eye I've now used seven
which<00:03:49.940> the<00:03:50.150> average<00:03:50.269> to<00:03:50.630> treat<00:03:50.840> one<00:03:50.989> eye<00:03:51.019> is

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:51.230 
which the average to treat one eye is

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:53.979 
which the average to treat one eye is
between<00:03:51.769> six<00:03:51.980> and<00:03:52.070> eight<00:03:52.780> so<00:03:53.780> now<00:03:53.840> I'm<00:03:53.900> going

00:03:53.979 --> 00:03:53.989 
between six and eight so now I'm going

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:55.330 
between six and eight so now I'm going
to<00:03:54.080> move<00:03:54.140> on<00:03:54.320> to<00:03:54.470> the<00:03:54.560> other<00:03:54.709> eye<00:03:54.769> and<00:03:55.070> I'm<00:03:55.190> just

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:55.340 
to move on to the other eye and I'm just

00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:01.690 
to move on to the other eye and I'm just
going<00:03:55.459> to<00:03:55.489> repeat<00:03:55.730> the<00:03:55.790> process<00:03:59.019> and<00:04:00.400> see<00:04:01.400> here

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:01.700 
going to repeat the process and see here

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:04.150 
going to repeat the process and see here
it's<00:04:01.910> not<00:04:02.120> quite<00:04:02.500> glowing<00:04:03.500> blue<00:04:03.709> and<00:04:04.010> then<00:04:04.130> you

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:04.160 
it's not quite glowing blue and then you

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:06.100 
it's not quite glowing blue and then you
just<00:04:04.370> have<00:04:04.459> to<00:04:04.549> position<00:04:04.940> it<00:04:05.030> correctly<00:04:05.360> and

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:06.110 
just have to position it correctly and

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:07.750 
just have to position it correctly and
then<00:04:06.290> it<00:04:06.380> looks<00:04:06.500> a<00:04:06.560> little<00:04:06.650> blue<00:04:07.160> and<00:04:07.459> you<00:04:07.610> know
