00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:45.700 
this is really super easy it took me a

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.539 
this is really super easy it took me a
while<00:01:45.909> to<00:01:45.969> figure<00:01:46.450> out<00:01:46.689> that<00:01:46.899> i<00:01:46.929> needed<00:01:47.380> a

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
while to figure out that i needed a

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.279 
while to figure out that i needed a
magnified<00:01:48.549> mirror<00:01:48.969> in<00:01:49.179> order<00:01:49.479> to<00:01:49.659> really<00:01:50.020> get

00:01:50.279 --> 00:01:50.289 
magnified mirror in order to really get

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:55.889 
magnified mirror in order to really get

00:01:55.889 --> 00:01:55.899 
right in on my upper lash line and I

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:57.809 
right in on my upper lash line and I
slowed<00:01:56.229> the<00:01:56.439> video<00:01:56.709> down<00:01:57.039> a<00:01:57.069> bit<00:01:57.369> just<00:01:57.579> so<00:01:57.670> you

00:01:57.809 --> 00:01:57.819 
slowed the video down a bit just so you

00:01:57.819 --> 00:02:08.820 
slowed the video down a bit just so you
could<00:01:58.030> see<00:01:58.299> how<00:01:58.329> I<00:01:58.539> do<00:01:58.719> it<00:02:06.539> and<00:02:07.560> there's<00:02:08.560> that<00:02:08.769> I

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:08.830 
could see how I do it and there's that I

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:11.250 
could see how I do it and there's that I
done<00:02:09.280> and<00:02:09.549> I<00:02:09.940> started<00:02:10.450> the<00:02:10.569> other<00:02:10.750> eye<00:02:10.869> and<00:02:11.230> I

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
done and I started the other eye and I

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.289 
done and I started the other eye and I
didn't<00:02:11.650> realize<00:02:12.040> until<00:02:12.069> I<00:02:12.580> had<00:02:12.819> already<00:02:12.940> done

00:02:13.289 --> 00:02:13.299
