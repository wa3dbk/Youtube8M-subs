in finance at Freddy's I would say it's

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.640 
in finance at Freddy's I would say it's
based<00:01:18.060> off<00:01:18.150> a<00:01:18.270> spring-trap<00:01:18.659> which<00:01:19.170> if<00:01:19.350> it<00:01:19.439> is

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
based off a spring-trap which if it is

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.530 
based off a spring-trap which if it is
based<00:01:19.920> off<00:01:20.070> a<00:01:20.130> spring-trap<00:01:20.520> that<00:01:21.060> brings<00:01:21.360> us

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.200 
obviously we're not gonna be like people
watching<00:01:26.430> this<00:01:26.520> people<00:01:26.820> have<00:01:26.909> played<00:01:27.090> the

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
watching this people have played the

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.550 
watching this people have played the
game<00:01:27.240> where<00:01:27.960> they're<00:01:28.080> gonna<00:01:28.170> be<00:01:28.290> new<00:01:28.439> people

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
game where they're gonna be new people

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.410 
game where they're gonna be new people
going<00:01:28.829> in<00:01:28.950> here<00:01:29.100> so<00:01:29.220> he's<00:01:29.340> not<00:01:29.430> explained<00:01:29.880> from

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
going in here so he's not explained from

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.300 
going in here so he's not explained from
the<00:01:30.720> beginning<00:01:31.020> all<00:01:31.320> the<00:01:31.350> way<00:01:31.500> to<00:01:31.560> the<00:01:31.740> end<00:01:31.920> of

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
the beginning all the way to the end of

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.399 
the beginning all the way to the end of
the<00:01:32.579> finance<00:01:32.820> for<00:01:32.909> a<00:01:32.970> series<00:01:33.329> so<00:01:33.600> if<00:01:33.810> this<00:01:34.170> is

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
the finance for a series so if this is

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:35.810 
the finance for a series so if this is
spring-trap<00:01:34.890> this<00:01:35.100> kind<00:01:35.280> of<00:01:35.340> shows<00:01:35.490> that<00:01:35.520> he

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
spring-trap this kind of shows that he

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.130 
spring-trap this kind of shows that he
is<00:01:35.850> gonna<00:01:36.210> be<00:01:36.420> showing<00:01:36.689> fazbear's<00:01:37.110> fright

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
is gonna be showing fazbear's fright

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.770 
is gonna be showing fazbear's fright
maybe<00:01:37.590> or<00:01:37.920> obviously<00:01:38.700> something<00:01:39.000> before<00:01:39.360> find

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
maybe or obviously something before find

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.210 
maybe or obviously something before find
out<00:01:39.900> the<00:01:39.990> Freddy's<00:01:40.259> because<00:01:40.590> you<00:01:41.130> know

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
out the Freddy's because you know

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.039 
out the Freddy's because you know
whenever<00:01:41.790> spring-trap<00:01:42.240> took<00:01:42.479> place<00:01:42.689> that's

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
whenever spring-trap took place that's

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.600 
whenever spring-trap took place that's
when<00:01:43.170> he's<00:01:43.259> gonna<00:01:43.380> be<00:01:43.470> showing<00:01:43.799> if<00:01:44.009> this<00:01:44.460> is

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
when he's gonna be showing if this is

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.210 
when he's gonna be showing if this is
spring<00:01:44.790> chat<00:01:45.000> like<00:01:45.149> I<00:01:45.240> said<00:01:45.420> before<00:01:45.630> guild<00:01:46.619> had

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
spring chat like I said before guild had

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:48.590 
spring chat like I said before guild had
just<00:01:47.520> this<00:01:47.670> doesn't<00:01:48.149> confirm<00:01:48.420> that

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
just this doesn't confirm that

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:49.969 
just this doesn't confirm that
spring-trap<00:01:48.960> at<00:01:49.140> all<00:01:49.439> this<00:01:49.619> could<00:01:49.829> just

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
spring-trap at all this could just

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.950 
spring-trap at all this could just
simply<00:01:50.220> be<00:01:50.369> him<00:01:50.549> testing<00:01:50.939> things<00:01:51.119> out<00:01:51.299> but

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
simply be him testing things out but

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.899 
simply be him testing things out but
from<00:01:52.290> if<00:01:52.470> our<00:01:52.590> office<00:01:52.860> speculation<00:01:53.310> here<00:01:53.430> my

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
from if our office speculation here my

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.429 
from if our office speculation here my
guess<00:01:53.970> is<00:01:54.390> that<00:01:54.509> this<00:01:54.689> is<00:01:54.750> spring-trap<00:01:55.200> just

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
guess is that this is spring-trap just

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.590 
guess is that this is spring-trap just
guessing<00:01:55.799> off<00:01:55.950> the<00:01:56.130> teeth<00:01:56.399> here<00:01:56.729> the<00:01:57.420> eyes

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
guessing off the teeth here the eyes

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.959 
guessing off the teeth here the eyes
obviously<00:01:58.500> we<00:01:58.649> can't<00:01:58.890> tell<00:01:59.250> for<00:01:59.460> sure<00:01:59.520> they<00:01:59.909> do

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
obviously we can't tell for sure they do

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.459 
obviously we can't tell for sure they do
kind<00:02:00.329> of<00:02:00.360> look<00:02:00.450> the<00:02:00.600> same<00:02:00.780> from<00:02:00.960> what<00:02:01.140> we<00:02:01.320> can

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
kind of look the same from what we can

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.230 
kind of look the same from what we can
see<00:02:01.710> but<00:02:02.219> like<00:02:02.310> I<00:02:02.430> said<00:02:02.579> it's<00:02:02.700> a<00:02:02.729> very<00:02:02.759> bare

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
see but like I said it's a very bare

commenting down below do you guys think
this<00:02:12.569> is<00:02:12.629> a<00:02:12.690> spring-trap<00:02:13.170> if<00:02:13.379> it

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
this is a spring-trap if it

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.560 
this is a spring-trap if it
is<00:02:13.890> what<00:02:14.220> do<00:02:14.280> you<00:02:14.370> guys<00:02:14.430> think<00:02:14.490> if<00:02:14.940> it<00:02:15.060> isn't<00:02:15.360> if

is what do you guys think if it isn't if
you<00:02:15.630> guys<00:02:15.720> don't<00:02:15.930> think<00:02:16.050> it<00:02:16.110> spring-trap<00:02:16.350> what

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
you guys don't think it spring-trap what

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.170 
you guys don't think it spring-trap what
do<00:02:16.560> you<00:02:16.620> guys<00:02:16.680> think<00:02:16.770> it<00:02:16.980> is<00:02:17.100> you<00:02:17.850> guys<00:02:17.970> think

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
do you guys think it is you guys think

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:19.370 
do you guys think it is you guys think
this<00:02:18.240> even<00:02:18.450> released<00:02:18.690> a<00:02:18.750> movie<00:02:18.870> at<00:02:19.050> all<00:02:19.170> I<00:02:19.200> mean

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
this even released a movie at all I mean

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.230 
this even released a movie at all I mean
obviously<00:02:19.770> I<00:02:20.130> think<00:02:20.370> it<00:02:20.850> would<00:02:21.030> at<00:02:21.210> least

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
obviously I think it would at least

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.030 
obviously I think it would at least
because<00:02:21.840> he's<00:02:21.960> always<00:02:22.470> been<00:02:22.680> tweeting<00:02:22.980> out

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
because he's always been tweeting out

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.310 
because he's always been tweeting out
these<00:02:23.160> little<00:02:23.280> hints<00:02:23.610> and<00:02:23.730> stuff<00:02:23.850> like<00:02:23.940> that

below<00:02:37.170> do<00:02:37.260> you<00:02:37.290> guys<00:02:37.410> think<00:02:37.560> the<00:02:37.650> spring-trap

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
below do you guys think the spring-trap

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:39.470 
below do you guys think the spring-trap
Dee<00:02:38.160> I<00:02:38.220> think<00:02:38.430> this<00:02:38.550> relates<00:02:39.000> to<00:02:39.120> the<00:02:39.210> movie<00:02:39.420> in

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
Dee I think this relates to the movie in

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.540 
Dee I think this relates to the movie in
some<00:02:39.720> sort<00:02:39.930> of<00:02:39.960> way<00:02:40.110> me<00:02:40.500> personally<00:02:41.010> I<00:02:41.220> think

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550 
some sort of way me personally I think

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:43.610 
some sort of way me personally I think
it<00:02:42.300> does<00:02:42.540> but<00:02:43.050> does<00:02:43.080> it<00:02:43.350> really<00:02:43.470> do

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
it does but does it really do

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.710 
it does but does it really do
spring-trap<00:02:44.070> I<00:02:44.370> don't<00:02:44.640> know<00:02:44.730> if<00:02:45.120> I<00:02:45.240> take<00:02:45.480> SLE
