when<00:00:56.420> we're<00:00:56.570> playing<00:00:56.690> fingerstyle<00:00:57.440> guitar<00:00:57.890> we

00:00:58.030 --> 00:00:58.040 
when we're playing fingerstyle guitar we

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:59.860 
when we're playing fingerstyle guitar we
use<00:00:58.190> abbreviations<00:00:58.550> to<00:00:59.330> indicate<00:00:59.750> the

00:00:59.860 --> 00:00:59.870 
use abbreviations to indicate the

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:02.920 
use abbreviations to indicate the
fingers<00:01:00.260> on<00:01:00.470> our<00:01:00.589> picking<00:01:00.980> hand<00:01:01.360> p<00:01:02.360> is<00:01:02.510> used<00:01:02.809> to

fingers on our picking hand p is used to
indicate<00:01:03.080> the<00:01:03.440> thumb<00:01:03.710> I<00:01:03.980> is<00:01:04.729> used<00:01:05.390> for<00:01:05.540> the

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:07.850 
index finger and this for the middle

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:11.139 
index finger and this for the middle
finger<00:01:08.210> and<00:01:08.330> the<00:01:08.500> a<00:01:09.500> is<00:01:09.860> used<00:01:10.490> to<00:01:10.640> indicate<00:01:10.789> the

00:01:11.139 --> 00:01:11.149 
finger and the a is used to indicate the

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:13.630 
finger and the a is used to indicate the
ring<00:01:11.330> finger<00:01:11.979> we're<00:01:12.979> going<00:01:13.100> to<00:01:13.220> pluck<00:01:13.430> the

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:13.640 
ring finger we're going to pluck the

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.440 
ring finger we're going to pluck the
first<00:01:14.000> string<00:01:14.390> with<00:01:14.990> em<00:01:15.610> the<00:01:16.610> second<00:01:17.090> string

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:17.450 
first string with em the second string

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:21.370 
first string with em the second string
with<00:01:17.869> I<00:01:17.899> and<00:01:18.560> the<00:01:19.310> third<00:01:19.640> string<00:01:20.180> with<00:01:20.780> P<00:01:21.080> like

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:21.380 
with I and the third string with P like

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:25.420 
with I and the third string with P like
this

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:25.430 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:29.500 

I<00:01:27.040> like<00:01:28.040> to<00:01:28.070> think<00:01:28.190> of<00:01:28.430> this<00:01:28.610> as<00:01:28.670> each<00:01:29.060> finger

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:29.510 
I like to think of this as each finger

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:31.990 
I like to think of this as each finger
as<00:01:29.630> assigned<00:01:29.930> a<00:01:30.110> string<00:01:30.550> and<00:01:31.550> you<00:01:31.670> can<00:01:31.820> try

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:32.000 
as assigned a string and you can try

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.460 
as assigned a string and you can try
using<00:01:32.240> a<00:01:32.540> and<00:01:32.900> M<00:01:33.020> also<00:01:34.570> on<00:01:35.570> the<00:01:35.840> first<00:01:36.110> string

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:36.470 
using a and M also on the first string

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:38.410 
using a and M also on the first string
we're<00:01:36.710> going<00:01:36.920> to<00:01:37.010> descend<00:01:37.550> a<00:01:37.700> natural<00:01:38.210> minor

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:38.420 
we're going to descend a natural minor

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:40.570 
we're going to descend a natural minor
scale<00:01:38.570> starting<00:01:39.380> on<00:01:39.500> the<00:01:39.650> twelfth<00:01:40.070> fret<00:01:40.310> and

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:40.580 
scale starting on the twelfth fret and

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:48.730 
scale starting on the twelfth fret and
go<00:01:40.850> down<00:01:41.060> like<00:01:41.300> this<00:01:41.360> and<00:01:47.470> now<00:01:48.470> all<00:01:48.619> we're

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:48.740 
go down like this and now all we're

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:50.140 
go down like this and now all we're
going<00:01:48.860> to<00:01:48.920> do<00:01:49.040> is<00:01:49.160> just<00:01:49.190> put<00:01:49.520> both<00:01:49.729> parts

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:50.150 
going to do is just put both parts

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:53.890 
going to do is just put both parts
together<00:01:50.390> let's<00:01:51.380> go<00:01:51.500> ahead<00:01:51.560> and<00:01:51.680> try<00:01:51.860> it
