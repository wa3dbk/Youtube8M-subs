00:05:58.189 --> 00:05:58.199 
side that is open is because we then

00:05:58.199 --> 00:06:01.149 
side that is open is because we then
need<00:05:58.499> that<00:05:58.799> ability<00:05:59.399> to<00:05:59.669> pull<00:05:59.879> this<00:06:00.089> tighter

00:06:03.949 --> 00:06:03.959 
with tighten do back up and then what

00:06:03.959 --> 00:06:05.809 
with tighten do back up and then what
we're<00:06:04.139> doing<00:06:04.169> is<00:06:04.559> feeding<00:06:05.069> this<00:06:05.249> one<00:06:05.519> from

00:06:05.809 --> 00:06:05.819 
we're doing is feeding this one from

00:06:05.819 --> 00:06:10.159
