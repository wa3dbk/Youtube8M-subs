used to fillet them out regular and then
kind<00:00:15.719> of<00:00:15.809> work<00:00:15.929> my<00:00:16.109> way<00:00:16.139> around<00:00:16.440> the<00:00:16.740> Y<00:00:16.890> bones

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
kind of work my way around the Y bones

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.099 
kind of work my way around the Y bones
but<00:00:17.940> I<00:00:17.970> found<00:00:18.210> an<00:00:18.420> easier<00:00:18.539> way<00:00:18.869> I've<00:00:18.990> been

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
but I found an easier way I've been

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.560 
but I found an easier way I've been
using<00:00:19.320> for<00:00:19.590> about<00:00:19.680> the<00:00:19.890> last<00:00:20.000> year<00:00:21.000> or<00:00:21.119> so<00:00:21.150> and

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
using for about the last year or so and

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.660 
using for about the last year or so and
it<00:00:22.080> gives<00:00:22.260> you<00:00:22.350> five<00:00:22.590> pieces<00:00:22.920> of<00:00:23.160> meat<00:00:23.460> so

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
it gives you five pieces of meat so

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.040 
it gives you five pieces of meat so
