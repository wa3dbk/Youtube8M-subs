00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:10.110
 wood finish metal or stone 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.670
 the process is laborious even if 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.830
 comes from relatively 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.500
 certainly no more meta 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:19.080
 this can be handheld or 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.500
 sanded with a file then look like 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.550
 sandpaper but if the surface area 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.740
 calculated in square meters 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.630
 let's say you need to grind a concrete wall 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.270
 before painting or parquet flooring 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:33.420
 floor before varnishing if material 

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:36.090
 less malleable than wood is not enough 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.070
 and grinders grinder 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.290
 this is a mechanized tool for 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.660
 roughing and finishing 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.300
 surface principle of their work is simple 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.940
 they take off their top processed 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.280
 abrasive material is scoured 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:53.100
 his working bodies abrasive material 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.199
 much stronger abrasion than 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.180
 the treated surface due to this 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.430
 and achieves the desired effect by 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:02.220
 the design of the type of work 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.140
 rest devices can be divided into 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:06.210
 several groups 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:09.659
 cutting machines or grinders such as 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.159
 This model but 5524 from the company omax 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.799
 used for cutting metal 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:16.110
 pipe fittings and to me in cases where 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:18.420
 need to get smooth and clean 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.970
 surface of the slice snap serves 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.580
 abrasive or diamond wheel high 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.860
 2400 watt power and large diameter 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.260
 230 mm cutting wheel 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.450
 will allow this machine to perform any 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:32.940
 designed for her to work along the way 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.430
 on the axial design of the housing assembly 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:36.510
 electric motor and gearbox 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:38.730
 provides increased accuracy and 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:41.430
 model rigidity and total reliability 

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:43.290
 and durability and leveling flat and 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:46.080
 not very rounded surfaces 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:48.390
 eccentric tape and 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:49.409
 just grinding machines 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.470
 grinding machines 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:55.230
 such as model pps 7 and from Bosch 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.390
 the most productive and powerful but with their 

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:58.830
 using hard to achieve perfectly smooth 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.140
 no trace 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:03.600
 skins and very difficult to align 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.909
 small surfaces nominal 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:09.090
 consuming the power of this machine 600 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:11.310
 watt working surface of the tape 76 by 130 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.680
 millimeter efficient way of use 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.690
 data of these machines surface treatment 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.790
 the area of ​​which many times exceeds 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.590
 area of ​​sanding case 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.610
 small surfaces tape machines 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.319
 justify themselves 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.330
 if you want to take off your fat 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:26.010
 materials for example align the tories from 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:28.230
 melancholy and 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30.510
 grinding machines or shredders 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:32.610
 occupy an intermediate position with one 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.019
 to the side they are productive enough 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:36.470
 on the other allows you to get smooth 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:40.019
 the surface is almost without a trace of skin 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:40.500
 Such is the model pss 200 ac and from the company 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:42.540
 bosch 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:46.049
 rated power consumption given 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:47.610
 200 watt size models that their soles are 92 

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:49.579
 by 182 millimeters 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:52.349
 working area sanding pad 

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:54.690
 makes circular movements durable and 

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:56.099
 hard base with soft backing 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:58.590
 allows you to properly align 

00:02:56.099 --> 00:03:00.510
 plane even if it is small soon 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.670
 grinding is much less than that 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:05.069
 tape machines but consumable 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:07.799
 plain sandpaper on fabric or 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:09.840
 paper base costs much less 

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:11.579
 which basically allows you to use 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.470
 tool for processing large 

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:14.819
 blanks 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:17.099
 eccentric sanders needed 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:21.690
 for the most accurate and precise work 

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:23.629
 such a model x 270 ogi from bosch 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:27.480
 nominal power consumption of the model 

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:30.000
 270 watt diameter disc polished 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:31.739
 5 millimeter eccentric grinders 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.500
 let you get perfectly smooth 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:35.459
 the surface of their sole makes difficult 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:37.650
 motion 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:39.540
 formed by the addition of circular motions 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:41.790
 rotational soles throughout the soles 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:43.319
 around the center due to the small footprint 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:44.970
 poor performance and 

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:47.459
 comparative high cost of consumables 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:49.949
 materials sandpaper on fiber 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:52.019
 basis such tools are not suitable for 

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:54.060
 rough processing of large areas of them 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:56.040
 appropriate to use for finishing 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:58.049
 surface treatments for painting and 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:00.660
 varnishing the conclusion let's say a few 

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:02.370
 words about security after all to work with 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:03.239
 completely oval machines required 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:05.370
 specific skill 

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:07.650
 because inept handling is fast 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:10.560
 rotating abrasive stones 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:12.139
 and tapes can cause injury all 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:14.549
 types of grinding and polishing 

00:04:12.139 --> 00:04:16.440
 devices leave a large number 

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:18.570
 fine dust if with wood dust 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:20.220
 you can still accept the metal 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:22.380
 stone is dangerous to health 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:24.930
 need to work tight clothes 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:27.380
 Mittens glasses or a protective shield and 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:27.380
 respirator
