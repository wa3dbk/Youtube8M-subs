00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
that's what we're talking about here and

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.459 
that's what we're talking about here and
apparently<00:00:39.000> a<00:00:39.030> lot<00:00:39.360> of<00:00:39.420> actors<00:00:39.930> use<00:00:40.140> it<00:00:40.320> but

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
apparently a lot of actors use it but

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.110 
apparently a lot of actors use it but
more<00:00:40.710> so<00:00:40.920> the<00:00:41.100> a-list<00:00:41.489> celebrities<00:00:41.879> because

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
more so the a-list celebrities because

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.510 
more so the a-list celebrities because
it's<00:00:42.300> really<00:00:42.719> really<00:00:43.079> expensive<00:00:43.980> and<00:00:44.430> there

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
it's really really expensive and there

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:45.650 
it's really really expensive and there
are<00:00:44.579> the<00:00:44.670> ones<00:00:44.820> with<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:45.059> clout<00:00:45.270> that<00:00:45.300> can

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
are the ones with the clout that can

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.100 
are the ones with the clout that can
demand<00:00:45.960> it<00:00:46.230> so<00:00:46.770> for<00:00:46.920> example<00:00:47.460> it<00:00:48.000> costs<00:00:48.270> $500

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
demand it so for example it costs $500

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.180 
demand it so for example it costs $500
to<00:00:49.340> $2,500<00:00:50.340> per<00:00:50.760> shot<00:00:51.000> frame-by-frame<00:00:52.190> $2,500

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
to $2,500 per shot frame-by-frame $2,500

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.979 
to $2,500 per shot frame-by-frame $2,500
so<00:00:53.309> you<00:00:53.399> can<00:00:53.520> imagine<00:00:53.699> a<00:00:53.969> whole<00:00:54.000> movie<00:00:54.449> how

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
so you can imagine a whole movie how

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.319 
so you can imagine a whole movie how
much<00:00:55.140> money<00:00:55.379> is<00:00:55.590> being<00:00:55.620> spent<00:00:56.190> on<00:00:56.430> this<00:00:56.730> also

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329

like Waterworld for example and that
they<00:01:52.920> had<00:01:53.130> digitally<00:01:54.090> put<00:01:54.240> in<00:01:54.390> strands<00:01:54.750> of

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
they had digitally put in strands of

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.230 
they had digitally put in strands of
hair<00:01:55.170> to<00:01:55.979> one<00:01:56.130> of<00:01:56.280> the<00:01:56.369> leading<00:01:56.670> actors<00:01:57.060> in

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
hair to one of the leading actors in

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.359 
hair to one of the leading actors in
that<00:01:57.360> movie<00:01:57.570> really<00:01:57.750> and<00:01:58.439> that<00:01:59.070> sound<00:01:59.310> that's

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
that movie really and that sound that's

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:00.800 
that movie really and that sound that's
so<00:01:59.520> crazy<00:01:59.759> back<00:02:00.030> then<00:02:00.270> because<00:02:00.420> we<00:02:00.600> didn't

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
so crazy back then because we didn't

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.389 
so crazy back then because we didn't
have<00:02:00.840> this<00:02:01.020> digital<00:02:01.259> technology<00:02:02.009> right<00:02:02.250> so

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
have this digital technology right so

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:03.380 
have this digital technology right so
you<00:02:02.490> can<00:02:02.610> imagine<00:02:02.939> how<00:02:03.000> much<00:02:03.119> more<00:02:03.299> expensive

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
you can imagine how much more expensive

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.469 
you can imagine how much more expensive
it<00:02:03.780> was<00:02:03.930> back<00:02:04.110> then<00:02:04.140> right<00:02:04.590> but<00:02:05.130> that<00:02:06.090> was<00:02:06.210> when

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
it was back then right but that was when

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.330 
it was back then right but that was when
I<00:02:06.509> first<00:02:06.780> heard<00:02:06.960> of<00:02:07.020> it<00:02:07.259> yeah<00:02:07.680> obviously<00:02:07.950> now

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
I first heard of it yeah obviously now

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.249 
I first heard of it yeah obviously now
is<00:02:08.520> a<00:02:08.550> lot<00:02:08.729> easier<00:02:09.030> to<00:02:09.149> do<00:02:09.569> it<00:02:09.690> but<00:02:09.780> still<00:02:09.989> it

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
is a lot easier to do it but still it

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.449 
is a lot easier to do it but still it
cost<00:02:10.500> you<00:02:10.679> over<00:02:10.950> 200

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:12.459 
cost you over 200

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:15.250 
cost you over 200
per<00:02:13.459> shot<00:02:13.700> which<00:02:14.090> is<00:02:14.120> insane<00:02:14.569> which<00:02:14.930> ends<00:02:15.230> up

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
per shot which is insane which ends up

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:16.540 
per shot which is insane which ends up
being<00:02:15.319> hundreds<00:02:15.830> of<00:02:15.890> thousand<00:02:16.160> dollars<00:02:16.400> but

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
being hundreds of thousand dollars but

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:18.040 
being hundreds of thousand dollars but
of<00:02:16.670> course<00:02:16.880> we<00:02:17.180> we<00:02:17.569> weren't<00:02:17.780> surprised

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.050 
of course we we weren't surprised

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:19.360 
of course we we weren't surprised
because<00:02:18.170> we<00:02:18.349> always<00:02:18.560> talked<00:02:18.920> about<00:02:19.130> on<00:02:19.280> the

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
because we always talked about on the

photoshop or you know paint in

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:07.840 
photoshop or you know paint in
frame-by-frame<00:03:06.260> what<00:03:06.890> they<00:03:07.010> do<00:03:07.069> is<00:03:07.459> they<00:03:07.640> just

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:07.850 
frame-by-frame what they do is they just

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:10.420 
frame-by-frame what they do is they just
map<00:03:08.269> your<00:03:08.480> face<00:03:08.750> and<00:03:09.049> the<00:03:09.500> celebrities<00:03:09.980> go<00:03:10.220> in

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
and get mapped show up and then they

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:15.970 
and get mapped show up and then they
scan<00:03:13.670> them<00:03:13.940> and<00:03:14.120> using<00:03:14.900> that<00:03:15.049> scan<00:03:15.500> and<00:03:15.799> some

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980 
scan them and using that scan and some

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:18.069 
scan them and using that scan and some
people<00:03:16.310> are<00:03:16.400> actually<00:03:16.570> banking<00:03:17.570> their<00:03:17.780> face

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:18.079

people are actually banking their face
scan<00:03:19.209> early<00:03:20.209> so<00:03:20.510> like<00:03:20.750> let's<00:03:21.049> say<00:03:21.260> i<00:03:21.290> would

00:03:21.759 --> 00:03:21.769 
scan early so like let's say i would

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:24.370 
scan early so like let's say i would
eventually<00:03:22.340> want<00:03:22.850> to<00:03:22.940> be<00:03:23.120> maybe<00:03:23.780> hopefully<00:03:24.079> a
