00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:45.520 
hold the grip ring and let's say you're

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.640 
hold the grip ring and let's say you're
going<00:01:45.640> to<00:01:45.700> reduce<00:01:45.970> our<00:01:46.180> arc<00:01:46.420> to<00:01:46.720> 90<00:01:47.350> degrees

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:47.650 
going to reduce our arc to 90 degrees

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:50.130 
going to reduce our arc to 90 degrees
you<00:01:47.970> then<00:01:48.970> check<00:01:49.210> to<00:01:49.330> see<00:01:49.479> exactly<00:01:49.750> where<00:01:49.990> that

you then check to see exactly where that

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:52.590 
you then check to see exactly where that
arc<00:01:50.320> is<00:01:50.470> at<00:01:50.850> this<00:01:51.850> point<00:01:52.060> you're<00:01:52.270> facing<00:01:52.450> the

you're<00:01:56.490> now<00:01:56.670> in<00:01:56.939> a<00:01:57.060> 90<00:01:57.329> degree<00:01:57.570> hour<00:01:59.329> to<00:02:00.329> then

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
you're now in a 90 degree hour to then

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.350 
you're now in a 90 degree hour to then
change<00:02:00.659> back<00:02:00.899> to<00:02:00.930> 180<00:02:01.409> degrees
