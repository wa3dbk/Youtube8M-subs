mechanically<00:00:20.490> inclined<00:00:20.910> by<00:00:21.090> any<00:00:21.300> stretch<00:00:21.510> of

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
mechanically inclined by any stretch of

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.170 
mechanically inclined by any stretch of
the<00:00:21.750> imagination<00:00:21.840> I<00:00:22.680> know<00:00:23.580> just<00:00:23.880> enough<00:00:24.150> to

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
the imagination I know just enough to

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.990 
the imagination I know just enough to
get<00:00:24.449> me<00:00:24.630> by<00:00:24.810> and<00:00:25.140> I<00:00:25.310> got<00:00:26.310> it<00:00:26.430> actually<00:00:26.550> running

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
get me by and I got it actually running

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.519 
get me by and I got it actually running
and<00:00:27.269> I<00:00:27.689> actually<00:00:27.810> had<00:00:28.050> to<00:00:28.140> turn<00:00:28.320> it<00:00:28.410> off

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
and I actually had to turn it off

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.820 
and I actually had to turn it off
because<00:00:28.880> my<00:00:29.880> neighbors<00:00:30.269> thought<00:00:31.109> that<00:00:31.470> it

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
because my neighbors thought that it

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.700 
because my neighbors thought that it
wasn't<00:00:32.040> a<00:00:32.189> good<00:00:32.309> idea<00:00:32.369> to<00:00:33.000> turn<00:00:33.809> on<00:00:34.140> this<00:00:34.380> loud

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
wasn't a good idea to turn on this loud

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.410 
wasn't a good idea to turn on this loud
machine<00:00:35.870> so<00:00:36.870> late<00:00:37.140> in<00:00:37.260> the<00:00:37.320> day<00:00:37.530> I<00:00:37.829> guess<00:00:38.550> you

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
machine so late in the day I guess you

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.540 
machine so late in the day I guess you
know<00:00:39.570> that's<00:00:40.440> probably<00:00:40.800> pretty<00:00:40.950> ignorant<00:00:41.460> I

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
know that's probably pretty ignorant I

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.610 
know that's probably pretty ignorant I
shouldn't<00:00:41.879> do<00:00:41.969> that<00:00:42.149> but<00:00:42.960> it<00:00:43.110> actually<00:00:43.140> runs

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
shouldn't do that but it actually runs

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.950 
shouldn't do that but it actually runs
