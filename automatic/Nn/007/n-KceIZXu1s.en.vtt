hanging baskets comes to life because

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.370 
hanging baskets comes to life because
we've<00:00:26.550> got<00:00:26.730> these<00:00:26.880> lattice<00:00:27.210> gates<00:00:27.480> and<00:00:27.750> these

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
we've got these lattice gates and these

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.169 
we've got these lattice gates and these
got<00:00:28.619> holes<00:00:28.830> in<00:00:29.010> to<00:00:29.130> allow<00:00:29.400> the<00:00:29.760> roots<00:00:29.910> to

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
got holes in to allow the roots to

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.060 
got holes in to allow the roots to
breathe<00:00:30.390> so<00:00:30.779> the<00:00:30.929> air<00:00:31.050> will<00:00:31.080> move<00:00:31.380> freely<00:00:31.710> in

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
breathe so the air will move freely in

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.860 
breathe so the air will move freely in
and<00:00:32.279> out<00:00:32.369> of<00:00:32.460> the<00:00:32.550> compost<00:00:32.969> but<00:00:33.570> what<00:00:33.690> they<00:00:33.809> do

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
and out of the compost but what they do

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.229 
and out of the compost but what they do
is<00:00:34.200> they<00:00:34.410> slip<00:00:35.250> down<00:00:35.460> like<00:00:35.670> this<00:00:35.850> into

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
is they slip down like this into

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:37.880 
is they slip down like this into
position<00:00:36.329> and<00:00:36.750> of<00:00:36.870> course<00:00:37.110> what<00:00:37.290> happens<00:00:37.320> is

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
position and of course what happens is

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.740 
position and of course what happens is
the<00:00:38.160> neck<00:00:38.340> of<00:00:38.370> the<00:00:38.610> plant<00:00:38.879> falls<00:00:39.329> into<00:00:39.570> this

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
the neck of the plant falls into this

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.110 
the neck of the plant falls into this
little<00:00:39.989> area<00:00:40.140> here<00:00:40.260> so<00:00:40.620> the<00:00:41.610> roots<00:00:41.820> are<00:00:41.910> on<00:00:42.000> the

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
just because you need to elevate it so

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.500 
just because you need to elevate it so
as<00:01:07.740> you're<00:01:07.860> planting<00:01:08.340> your<00:01:08.520> little<00:01:09.150> plants<00:01:09.420> in

here of course it's going to elevate

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.620 
here of course it's going to elevate
them<00:01:11.220> up<00:01:11.340> so<00:01:11.520> they're<00:01:11.850> not<00:01:11.939> getting<00:01:12.150> damaged

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
them up so they're not getting damaged

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.670

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
plenty of compost around it and they're

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:31.880 
plenty of compost around it and they're
perfectly<00:03:30.209> spaced<00:03:30.540> that<00:03:31.320> means<00:03:31.590> they<00:03:31.769> will

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890 
perfectly spaced that means they will

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:33.650 
perfectly spaced that means they will
all<00:03:32.130> reach<00:03:32.459> their<00:03:32.760> full<00:03:32.970> potential<00:03:33.329> and

all reach their full potential and
that's<00:03:33.780> critical<00:03:34.500> about<00:03:34.680> any<00:03:34.890> hanging<00:03:35.250> basket

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:35.670 
that's critical about any hanging basket

that's critical about any hanging basket
the<00:03:36.510> other<00:03:36.630> thing<00:03:36.840> you'll<00:03:36.959> notice<00:03:36.989> is<00:03:37.320> we're

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
the other thing you'll notice is we're

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:39.199 
the other thing you'll notice is we're
planting<00:03:37.769> the<00:03:38.190> whole<00:03:38.459> of<00:03:38.760> the<00:03:38.850> hanging<00:03:39.000> basket

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:39.209 
planting the whole of the hanging basket

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:41.599 
planting the whole of the hanging basket
so<00:03:39.570> we're<00:03:39.690> not<00:03:39.810> planting<00:03:40.079> the<00:03:40.890> top<00:03:41.160> we're

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:41.609 
so we're not planting the top we're

00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:44.509 
so we're not planting the top we're
planting<00:03:41.850> all<00:03:42.510> around<00:03:43.200> the<00:03:43.320> whole<00:03:43.560> basket

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:44.519 
planting all around the whole basket

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:48.050 
planting all around the whole basket
which<00:03:44.640> means<00:03:44.910> you're<00:03:45.780> going<00:03:45.930> to<00:03:46.079> get<00:03:47.060> 360

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
which means you're going to get 360

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:51.080 
which means you're going to get 360
degrees<00:03:48.359> of<00:03:48.630> perfect<00:03:49.620> color<00:03:49.920> from<00:03:50.640> the<00:03:50.730> moment

its full potential now in with a bit
more<00:05:01.350> compost<00:05:01.740> now<00:05:02.360> I<00:05:03.360> like<00:05:03.630> to<00:05:03.660> layer<00:05:04.050> the

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:04.710 
more compost now I like to layer the

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:09.620 
more compost now I like to layer the
range<00:05:05.670> LM<00:05:06.000> food<00:05:06.270> so<00:05:07.140> then<00:05:07.920> we<00:05:08.220> go<00:05:08.370> there<00:05:08.630> don't

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:09.630 
range LM food so then we go there don't

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:11.660 
range LM food so then we go there don't
need<00:05:09.810> to<00:05:09.870> be<00:05:10.020> too<00:05:10.350> accurate<00:05:10.530> but<00:05:10.890> two<00:05:11.310> or<00:05:11.460> three

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:11.670 
need to be too accurate but two or three

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:14.960 
need to be too accurate but two or three
teaspoons<00:05:11.940> per<00:05:12.630> layer<00:05:13.530> and<00:05:13.820> plenty<00:05:14.820> more

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:14.970 
teaspoons per layer and plenty more

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:18.410 
teaspoons per layer and plenty more
compost<00:05:16.640> professional<00:05:17.640> compost<00:05:18.060> the<00:05:18.210> better

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:18.420 
compost professional compost the better

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:23.180 
compost professional compost the better
quality<00:05:18.720> composts<00:05:19.620> tend<00:05:20.430> to<00:05:20.640> contain<00:05:21.630> a<00:05:22.190> good

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:23.190 
quality composts tend to contain a good

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:26.300 
quality composts tend to contain a good
starter<00:05:23.910> nutrient<00:05:24.390> so<00:05:24.840> the<00:05:25.470> real<00:05:25.650> benefit<00:05:26.280> of

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:26.310 
starter nutrient so the real benefit of

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:30.320 
starter nutrient so the real benefit of
this<00:05:26.520> is<00:05:26.760> that<00:05:26.900> they're<00:05:27.900> going<00:05:28.200> to<00:05:29.030> contain<00:05:30.030> a

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:30.330 
this is that they're going to contain a

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:33.680 
this is that they're going to contain a
bit<00:05:31.200> more<00:05:31.380> goodness<00:05:32.040> for<00:05:32.400> your<00:05:32.520> plants<00:05:32.910> I've

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:33.690 
bit more goodness for your plants I've

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:35.540 
bit more goodness for your plants I've
got<00:05:33.840> five<00:05:34.050> primroses<00:05:34.710> that<00:05:35.220> I'm<00:05:35.310> just<00:05:35.430> going

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:35.550 
got five primroses that I'm just going

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:37.640 
got five primroses that I'm just going
to<00:05:35.610> pop<00:05:35.790> in<00:05:35.970> here<00:05:36.000> and<00:05:36.300> have<00:05:36.960> mounded<00:05:37.410> the

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:37.650 
to pop in here and have mounded the

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:40.910 
to pop in here and have mounded the
compost<00:05:38.130> up<00:05:38.340> specifically<00:05:39.270> so<00:05:40.140> that<00:05:40.410> will

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:40.920 
compost up specifically so that will

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:43.310 
compost up specifically so that will
settle<00:05:41.160> down<00:05:41.430> and<00:05:41.760> we've<00:05:41.880> got<00:05:42.060> the<00:05:42.870> positions

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:43.320 
settle down and we've got the positions

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:45.170 
settle down and we've got the positions
where<00:05:43.560> the<00:05:44.310> chains<00:05:44.610> are<00:05:44.730> going<00:05:44.850> to<00:05:44.910> go<00:05:45.030> there

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:45.180 
where the chains are going to go there

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:46.550 
where the chains are going to go there
are<00:05:45.270> four<00:05:45.510> chains<00:05:45.840> on<00:05:46.140> this<00:05:46.260> particular

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:46.560 
are four chains on this particular

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:50.150 
are four chains on this particular
basket<00:05:46.890> design<00:05:47.430> so<00:05:48.290> the<00:05:49.290> Primrose<00:05:49.740> is<00:05:49.770> I'm

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:50.160 
basket design so the Primrose is I'm

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:53.540 
basket design so the Primrose is I'm
going<00:05:50.370> to<00:05:50.430> plant<00:05:50.750> so<00:05:51.750> they<00:05:51.840> fall<00:05:52.220> directly<00:05:53.220> in

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:53.550 
going to plant so they fall directly in

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:57.530 
going to plant so they fall directly in
between<00:05:54.320> the<00:05:55.320> locations<00:05:56.010> of<00:05:56.310> the<00:05:57.270> chains

00:05:57.530 --> 00:05:57.540 
between the locations of the chains

00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:58.880 
between the locations of the chains
which<00:05:57.720> means<00:05:57.960> that<00:05:58.080> when<00:05:58.200> the<00:05:58.290> chains<00:05:58.590> pull

00:05:58.880 --> 00:05:58.890 
which means that when the chains pull

00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:01.940 
which means that when the chains pull
upwards<00:05:59.220> they<00:06:00.030> don't<00:06:00.240> actually<00:06:00.590> cut<00:06:01.590> across

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:01.950 
upwards they don't actually cut across

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:05.090 
upwards they don't actually cut across
any<00:06:02.280> of<00:06:02.400> the<00:06:02.550> plants<00:06:02.820> in<00:06:03.270> the<00:06:03.840> top<00:06:04.050> section<00:06:04.350> of

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:05.100 
any of the plants in the top section of

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:08.660 
any of the plants in the top section of
the<00:06:05.220> basket<00:06:06.230> so<00:06:07.230> I'm<00:06:07.860> pretty<00:06:08.070> pleased<00:06:08.400> without

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:08.670 
the basket so I'm pretty pleased without

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:12.920 
the basket so I'm pretty pleased without
now<00:06:08.790> that's<00:06:09.260> that's<00:06:10.260> done<00:06:10.700> so<00:06:11.700> on<00:06:12.420> with<00:06:12.840> the

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:12.930 
now that's that's done so on with the

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:15.250 
now that's that's done so on with the
chain<00:06:13.110> now<00:06:13.320> this<00:06:13.470> is<00:06:13.590> a<00:06:13.620> very<00:06:13.890> strong<00:06:14.190> chain

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:15.260 
chain now this is a very strong chain

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:17.720 
chain now this is a very strong chain
the<00:06:16.260> beauty<00:06:16.620> of<00:06:16.650> this<00:06:16.800> chain<00:06:17.100> I<00:06:17.130> really<00:06:17.550> like

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:17.730 
the beauty of this chain I really like

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:20.990 
the beauty of this chain I really like
is<00:06:18.000> it's<00:06:18.510> got<00:06:18.690> a<00:06:18.720> t-bar<00:06:19.290> designed<00:06:20.220> to<00:06:20.400> it<00:06:20.550> which

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:21.000 
is it's got a t-bar designed to it which

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.060 
is it's got a t-bar designed to it which
means<00:06:21.240> that<00:06:21.570> instead<00:06:22.320> of<00:06:22.440> getting<00:06:22.740> the<00:06:22.830> pliers

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:23.070 
means that instead of getting the pliers

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:24.560 
means that instead of getting the pliers
out<00:06:23.280> and<00:06:23.460> messing<00:06:23.760> around<00:06:23.850> with<00:06:24.090> hooks<00:06:24.300> you

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:24.570 
out and messing around with hooks you

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:26.330 
out and messing around with hooks you
don't<00:06:24.720> have<00:06:24.840> to<00:06:24.960> do<00:06:25.080> that<00:06:25.230> these<00:06:25.680> drop<00:06:26.040> through

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:26.340 
don't have to do that these drop through

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:27.620 
don't have to do that these drop through
like<00:06:26.490> a<00:06:26.520> ship's<00:06:26.820> anchor<00:06:26.940> and<00:06:27.270> as<00:06:27.330> you<00:06:27.420> pull

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:27.630 
like a ship's anchor and as you pull

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:29.240 
like a ship's anchor and as you pull
them<00:06:27.750> up<00:06:27.840> they<00:06:28.410> literally<00:06:28.800> lock<00:06:28.980> into

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:29.250 
them up they literally lock into

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:31.820 
them up they literally lock into
position<00:06:29.370> so<00:06:29.850> I<00:06:30.060> can<00:06:30.720> show<00:06:30.900> you<00:06:30.960> that<00:06:31.110> just

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:31.830 
position so I can show you that just

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:34.960 
position so I can show you that just
here<00:06:32.070> so<00:06:32.400> in<00:06:32.669> goes<00:06:32.910> my<00:06:33.180> first

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:34.970 
here so in goes my first

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:38.660 
here so in goes my first
Chane<00:06:35.970> drop<00:06:36.540> it<00:06:36.690> down<00:06:36.840> through<00:06:37.140> there<00:06:37.490> you<00:06:38.490> can

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:38.670 
Chane drop it down through there you can

00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:41.210 
Chane drop it down through there you can
see<00:06:38.820> there<00:06:39.030> now<00:06:39.330> as<00:06:39.450> it<00:06:39.570> drops<00:06:39.810> into<00:06:40.190> position

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:41.220 
see there now as it drops into position

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:44.330 
see there now as it drops into position
lots<00:06:41.750> safely<00:06:42.750> and<00:06:43.200> the<00:06:43.500> benefit<00:06:44.070> of<00:06:44.100> having

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:44.340 
lots safely and the benefit of having

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:47.480 
lots safely and the benefit of having
four<00:06:44.910> chains<00:06:45.650> from<00:06:46.650> your<00:06:46.860> perspective<00:06:47.370> when

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:47.490 
four chains from your perspective when

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:48.950 
four chains from your perspective when
you<00:06:47.550> get<00:06:47.700> these<00:06:47.790> home<00:06:47.850> particularly<00:06:48.780> if

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:48.960 
you get these home particularly if

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:51.700 
you get these home particularly if
you've<00:06:49.080> got<00:06:49.230> a<00:06:49.260> slightly<00:06:49.860> windy<00:06:50.160> position<00:06:50.730> is

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:51.710 
you've got a slightly windy position is

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:54.740 
you've got a slightly windy position is
they're<00:06:52.710> going<00:06:52.800> to<00:06:52.860> give<00:06:53.010> you<00:06:53.190> better<00:06:53.940> balance

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:54.750

more<00:06:55.500> strength<00:06:55.830> more<00:06:56.250> stability<00:06:56.880> and<00:06:57.300> most

00:06:58.250 --> 00:06:58.260 
more strength more stability and most

00:06:58.260 --> 00:06:59.720 
more strength more stability and most
importantly<00:06:58.770> you<00:06:59.040> won't<00:06:59.280> suffer<00:06:59.520> the
