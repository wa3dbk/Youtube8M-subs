00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:08.100
 hello and welcome that nice 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.710
 her interest in my new 

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:14.190
 quick tip you today is about the 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:17.520
 sharpen theme in lightroom or in 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:20.119
 photoshop in the raw converter for me 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:24.089
 is the subject of one of the sharpen 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:26.130
 key components of development 

00:00:24.089 --> 00:00:28.740
 and I just want to give you that 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.990
 show my thoughts and my workflow 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.120
 And yes, maybe there are now 23 tips 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.340
 while you her son the forms before 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.590
 not seen, we did find ourselves 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:41.039
 now here in adobe photoshop in the 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:43.320
 bridge and I have just now 

00:00:41.039 --> 00:00:46.890
 a picture picked out the picture is out 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:49.260
 the landscape park north in duisburg and 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:52.859
 In the picture you can actually the 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.059
 sharpening as I distinguished very 

00:00:52.859 --> 00:00:55.949
 demonstrate nicely 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.859
 by double-clicking on the picture 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:03.329
 opens now in photoshop the raw 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:06.360
 converter yes a correct sharpness 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:09.390
 Appraisal is actually always at 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.670
 100 percent of the picture view possible this 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.770
 Let's do it now 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:16.830
 I'm looking for 100% and good 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:20.990
 if a clipping where we now 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:25.470
 the sharpness can judge quite well 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:30.740
 so important for you to know now 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:33.079
 that the rocker words of 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:36.259
 of photoshop actually comparable 

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:38.119
 i am developing with lightroom i 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:39.860
 do not want to say zone percent though 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:42.470
 just the area of ​​the area 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:45.530
 Sharpening is one thing you can really do 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:47.420
 one also so take in the lightroom 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:49.009
 Everything is what I show here now 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:52.009
 the lightroom also one to one like that 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:55.250
 possible how can we get sharper now 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:57.560
 in the picture most start and 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:00.289
 put the amount of regulator here 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.929
 above is further to the right so 

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:07.640
 that is, we increase the value 

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:09.080
 and yes, if I look at 150 something 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.420
 you would normally never do otherwise 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:13.580
 we already have really cool 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.890
 sharpness here so mature and also that 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:17.750
 looks pretty nice but with 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:20.090
 We buy ourselves these extremely high values 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.880
 a big problem and that the 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:25.880
 picture in the small micro details now 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.450
 here begins pixelated and rushes to 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.150
 become 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.799
 Of course that's not what it is now 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:33.430
 what you really do at one 

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:40.570
 optimal sharpening can use 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:43.370
 I put the value back on his 60th 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:44.959
 I have been asking myself for a long time 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:46.730
 sharpening quass of the paravents 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:49.640
 switch mask down here at all 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:51.500
 you can do it down here 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:53.570
 turn around as much as you want and 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:57.079
 somehow it really works out here too 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:59.209
 nothing and you ask yourself well if yourself 

00:02:57.079 --> 00:03:01.180
 do not do this if nothing does this 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:02.900
 actually not at all 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:06.530
 At some point I have a little one 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:09.079
 Tip get that the regulator times 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:10.970
 to move back and forth while 

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:13.010
 at the same time still the old button on the 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:16.850
 keyboard has pressed that I do 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:17.750
 Now and where I am the first time 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:19.430
 have seen 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:22.970
 it actually seems like a shed of 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:24.799
 yes please 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:27.500
 Now I know what the mask regulator 

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:29.700
 makes the masked regulator lies one 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:33.180
 mask on 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:35.400
 on the left everything is white speak everything 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:38.190
 will be completely business on the right 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:40.680
 you only really create the pure 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:43.050
 Contours so what's black now 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:46.010
 is not sharpened and what soft 

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:48.680
 is sharpened 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:50.819
 each one of you architecture 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:52.530
 actually should be photographed now 

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:54.780
 make a cheer if he still has it 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:56.790
 does not know because that's exactly what 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:59.400
 you need for architectural recordings 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:00.200
 really only the clean contours too 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:02.819
 sharpen 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:04.830
 Of course it is in photoshop itself 

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:06.540
 but you are already tinkering completely 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:10.700
 a really good to really the 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:14.220
 optimum sharpness mask to lie down 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:16.769
 I 'm looking for a value where I am now 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:19.919
 my could fit and I think na 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:21.900
 yes the value 70 is actually okay 

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:27.410
 maybe we'll go one more tick 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:30.270
 hears so on 80 by that we now 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:32.940
 have masked different areas 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:36.300
 have fun and the 

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:39.120
 contours and a few details further 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:41.669
 have made white so have masked 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:44.220
 Now we have the possibility with these 

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:47.250
 Fix up here with the radius with the 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:49.340
 amount significantly further upwards 

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:52.139
 go as we would do it 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:53.970
 I'll show you the whole time I go 

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:57.120
 Now up here on a value of 

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:58.680
 120 which is really very high what 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:01.350
 Otherwise you would not actually do that 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:03.650
 and now I'll increase the radius 

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:03.650
 2 

00:05:06.879 --> 00:05:12.139
 These are really two combinations 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:15.169
 you actually never masquerade mask 

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:17.840
 should do and I'll show you the times 

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:21.439
 before after effect before after 

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:23.930
 before here really a very 

00:05:21.439 --> 00:05:26.120
 nice sharpening on the edges 

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:28.210
 Sharpness is negotiating everywhere 

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:30.169
 but we have no noise 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:32.560
 I'll show you again like the whole 

00:05:30.169 --> 00:05:36.860
 without masking mask would go out 

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:40.189
 So everything completely noisy put us 

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:44.750
 this masking mask is looking for us 

00:05:40.189 --> 00:05:46.930
 Maybe a value could fit 

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:52.520
 let's go even hear a ticking 

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:55.370
 on 90 of the details maybe one 

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:59.330
 little bit down we can do that 

00:05:55.370 --> 00:06:03.830
 increase radius even more 

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:05.960
 We actually have that amount 

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:08.569
 Here is a very nice sharpness 

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:10.550
 the mature without the picture somehow 

00:06:08.569 --> 00:06:11.229
 scary we raise that noise 

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:16.629
 becomes 

00:06:11.229 --> 00:06:19.520
 and look how it looks at 50% 

00:06:16.629 --> 00:06:20.300
 was really a very nice crack 

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:23.539
 clear image 

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:25.189
 I hope you could with the tip of 

00:06:23.539 --> 00:06:27.860
 Chefs what to do I would be glad 

00:06:25.189 --> 00:06:29.930
 if you give me a feedback and 

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:33.039
 Maybe we'll see each other next 

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:33.039
 quicktipp again
