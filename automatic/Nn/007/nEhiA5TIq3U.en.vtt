00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:15.180 
pretty young guy and you know picking it

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:17.390 
pretty young guy and you know picking it
up<00:00:15.350> that's<00:00:16.350> that's<00:00:16.650> a<00:00:16.740> good<00:00:16.920> thing<00:00:17.070> but<00:00:17.279> we

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
up that's that's a good thing but we

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.520 
up that's that's a good thing but we
don't<00:00:17.550> have<00:00:17.580> to<00:00:17.730> stop<00:00:18.000> stop<00:00:18.359> and<00:00:18.570> stuff<00:00:18.750> but

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:19.530 
don't have to stop stop and stuff but

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:21.650 
don't have to stop stop and stuff but
he's<00:00:19.650> throwing<00:00:19.950> stuff<00:00:20.100> out<00:00:20.250> as<00:00:20.400> fast<00:00:20.610> and<00:00:21.000> I

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:07.460 
care of it so I have thought about that

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:09.910 
care of it so I have thought about that
and<00:02:07.970> you<00:02:08.840> know<00:02:08.930> we<00:02:09.050> all<00:02:09.200> gonna<00:02:09.380> face<00:02:09.590> it<00:02:09.740> over

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 
and you know we all gonna face it over

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:13.200 
and you know we all gonna face it over
every<00:02:10.610> team<00:02:10.820> in<00:02:10.910> the<00:02:10.940> NBA<00:02:11.060> is<00:02:11.270> on<00:02:11.480> faces<00:02:11.900> so

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.210 
every team in the NBA is on faces so

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:15.820 
every team in the NBA is on faces so
hopefully<00:02:14.210> we're<00:02:14.360> team<00:02:14.600> they<00:02:14.810> can<00:02:15.020> you<00:02:15.590> notify

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
hopefully we're team they can you notify

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:19.240 
hopefully we're team they can you notify
eyes<00:02:16.250> and<00:02:17.380> have<00:02:18.380> it<00:02:18.530> every<00:02:18.740> night<00:02:18.890> but<00:02:19.070> that's

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
eyes and have it every night but that's

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:21.220 
eyes and have it every night but that's
impossible<00:02:19.340> so<00:02:20.330> you<00:02:20.390> know<00:02:20.600> it's<00:02:20.900> just<00:02:20.960> about

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
impossible so you know it's just about

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:22.870 
impossible so you know it's just about
the<00:02:21.350> death<00:02:21.500> of<00:02:21.530> our<00:02:21.710> team<00:02:21.890> it's<00:02:22.490> just<00:02:22.640> a<00:02:22.700> tough

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:22.880 
the death of our team it's just a tough

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.290 
the death of our team it's just a tough
matchup<00:02:23.230> first<00:02:24.230> of<00:02:24.290> all<00:02:24.350> he's<00:02:24.530> so<00:02:25.270> she's<00:02:26.270> just

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:26.300 
matchup first of all he's so she's just

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:31.960 
matchup first of all he's so she's just
so<00:02:27.430> it's<00:02:28.430> when<00:02:28.820> he<00:02:28.850> wants<00:02:29.180> position<00:02:30.550> he<00:02:31.550> pretty

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
so it's when he wants position he pretty

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:34.510 
so it's when he wants position he pretty
much<00:02:32.030> gets<00:02:32.390> it<00:02:32.770> as<00:02:33.770> a<00:02:33.860> defender<00:02:34.250> you<00:02:34.340> want<00:02:34.459> to

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:34.520 
much gets it as a defender you want to

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:36.490 
much gets it as a defender you want to
push<00:02:34.670> modest<00:02:35.030> as<00:02:35.180> far<00:02:35.450> as<00:02:35.540> possible<00:02:35.750> but<00:02:36.350> it's

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
push modest as far as possible but it's

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:37.780 
push modest as far as possible but it's
tough<00:02:36.709> and<00:02:36.980> obviously<00:02:37.220> once<00:02:37.490> he<00:02:37.550> gets<00:02:37.670> the

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
tough and obviously once he gets the

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:39.880 
tough and obviously once he gets the
ball<00:02:37.820> down<00:02:38.120> there<00:02:38.300> and<00:02:38.900> go<00:02:39.080> both<00:02:39.410> hands<00:02:39.680> and

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 
ball down there and go both hands and

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:42.670 
ball down there and go both hands and
you're<00:02:40.010> both<00:02:40.130> shoulders<00:02:41.230> and<00:02:42.230> the<00:02:42.380> toughest

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
you're both shoulders and the toughest

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.340 
you're both shoulders and the toughest
thing<00:02:42.800> is<00:02:42.920> just<00:02:43.370> from<00:02:43.610> pollow's<00:02:44.420> that's<00:02:45.170> why

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:45.350 
thing is just from pollow's that's why

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:47.320 
thing is just from pollow's that's why
so<00:02:45.560> tough<00:02:45.770> it<00:02:46.070> helps<00:02:46.340> us<00:02:46.459> get<00:02:46.640> into<00:02:46.790> our<00:02:46.970> spots

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:47.330 
so tough it helps us get into our spots

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:49.750 
so tough it helps us get into our spots
