00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
it's di2 shifters from Shimano so there

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.729 
it's di2 shifters from Shimano so there
are<00:01:02.820> electronic<00:01:03.180> shifters<00:01:03.600> so<00:01:03.750> if<00:01:03.870> you<00:01:04.049> take<00:01:04.680> a

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
are electronic shifters so if you take a

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:11.919 
are electronic shifters so if you take a
look<00:01:04.920> down<00:01:04.979> here<00:01:05.309> you<00:01:05.429> can<00:01:05.609> hear<00:01:05.789> the<00:01:05.999> little

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:14.660 

that<00:01:12.929> changes<00:01:13.350> gear<00:01:13.619> and<00:01:13.920> makes<00:01:14.369> a<00:01:14.490> good

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
that changes gear and makes a good

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.230 
that changes gear and makes a good
electronic<00:01:15.090> noise<00:01:16.729> different<00:01:17.729> to<00:01:17.789> the<00:01:17.880> normal
