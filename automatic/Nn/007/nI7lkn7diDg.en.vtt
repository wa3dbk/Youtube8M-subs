00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:04.669
 the dear friend friends speaks to them 

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:05.180
 Christian that the page trancar ex 

00:00:04.669 --> 00:00:06.859
 dot com 

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:09.080
 I would say I want to talk about the 

00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:10.520
 I have been drinking milk 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:12.070
 arriving many questions of people 

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:15.280
 asking me 

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:16.900
 if they should take quantity of glasses of 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:19.420
 milk or liters of milk or gallons of 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:22.450
 milk a day and I want to tell you though 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:24.759
 whey protein is a product of 

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:26.410
 milk or let's say take a glass of 

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:30.289
 milk 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:33.110
 20 percent of milk whey 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:36.489
 after being 20 percent by 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:39.890
 laboratory processes can make 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:43.610
 there are proteins or isolated and more isolated 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:45.110
 and jai crawford and purer but it's because 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:46.190
 the whey protein comes from the milk 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:48.649
 it does not mean that you can not take 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:50.340
 milk quantities the problem with the 

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:53.490
 milk of the following 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:56.550
 has a lot of carbohydrates has a lot 

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:59.550
 lactic acid and for people who do not 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.559
 suffer from problems of the lactic acid 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.540
 too much milk consumption as I say 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.060
 it will go up a lot the levels of 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:07.979
 insulin because much more fluid data 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.400
 they require more insulin so that for 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.740
 the body can be normalized 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.750
 the milk also has a lot of acid 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:16.940
 lactic that becomes fatigue that 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:19.550
 It can also appear in the body 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:22.010
 Cramp through fatigue is when 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:25.190
 you are training and you do not feel like it 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:27.560
 training can give you nausea may 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:29.810
 giving you fatigue can give you practice in 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:32.890
 sense of stomach pains can 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:36.320
 have gas and may also have nausea 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:38.360
 milk can also cramp 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.100
 itself is good for a right glass to the 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:44.180
 day or two glasses right the day program 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:46.820
 not only that but the gas is a 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:51.040
 gas but that the body gives you discomfort 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:52.840
 stomach and sometimes you may get diarrhea 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:55.380
 I want to do studies to people 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.780
 very well because they believe that 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.130
 there's no place for the supplements and I 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.409
 I am here to tell you that if there is a place 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.610
 for the implements that 90% is diet 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:05.130
 we are giving in terms of in 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:08.220
 training prisons but 90% 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:10.210
 it's diet food but supplements and 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.850
 they have their place 

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:14.950
 if a person for example a portion 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:18.520
 of protein alone yields 30 grams of 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.990
 protein or 25 30 grams to have that 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:21.670
 same amount of milk will not have to 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:24.580
 take at least a liter and a half of 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:27.670
 milk and the gastrointestinal system 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:29.560
 can hold that amount of milk for 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.330
 that's where the supplements come 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:34.480
 so please be esteemed friends and 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:36.390
 friends please listen to me no more than one 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.650
 glass or a glass and a half of milk a day 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.840
 although whey protein comes from the 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:42.790
 milk does not justify taking quantities 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.590
 big milk because the body does not 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:46.960
 can sustain and there are many reactions 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:48.670
 bad of as small as erratic 

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:50.500
 to as big as cramps and you 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:52.270
 gives a cramp to a weight station 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:54.130
 dead or when you're in the exercise of 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:55.960
 legs or is on the bench and gives you a 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:57.670
 cramp able to fall all 

00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:01.470
 the dams above and I'm talking to you 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:01.470
 very seriously take care that a milk
