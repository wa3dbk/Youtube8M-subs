one on there now the smaller one then
we'll<00:03:41.580> go<00:03:41.760> on<00:03:41.970> to<00:03:42.000> our<00:03:42.780> air<00:03:43.080> intake<00:03:43.530> tube<00:03:43.800> and

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:44.640 
we'll go on to our air intake tube and

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:47.750 
we'll go on to our air intake tube and
then<00:03:45.150> the<00:03:45.300> last<00:03:45.510> one<00:03:45.870> goes<00:03:46.739> down<00:03:47.040> on<00:03:47.280> to<00:03:47.489> our

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
then the last one goes down on to our

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.390 
then the last one goes down on to our
turbo<00:03:48.150> tube<00:03:48.470> then<00:03:49.470> we'll<00:03:49.620> just<00:03:49.770> go<00:03:49.950> ahead<00:03:50.070> and

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
turbo tube then we'll just go ahead and

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.729 
turbo tube then we'll just go ahead and
lay<00:03:51.270> our<00:03:51.420> clamps<00:03:51.870> in<00:03:52.050> here<00:03:52.260> where<00:03:52.500> we're<00:03:52.620> going

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:52.739 
lay our clamps in here where we're going

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:56.180 
lay our clamps in here where we're going
to<00:03:52.800> need<00:03:52.980> them<00:03:54.620> so<00:03:55.620> now<00:03:55.770> we're<00:03:55.920> going<00:03:56.010> to<00:03:56.070> go

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190 
to need them so now we're going to go

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:08.120 
to need them so now we're going to go
ahead<00:03:56.370> and<00:03:56.489> put<00:03:56.640> this<00:03:56.790> tube<00:03:57.090> in<00:03:57.300> here

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:08.130 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:10.550 

okay<00:04:08.970> once<00:04:09.180> we<00:04:09.330> get<00:04:09.450> our<00:04:09.630> two<00:04:09.810> ball<00:04:10.080> installed

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 
okay once we get our two ball installed

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:13.070 
okay once we get our two ball installed
then<00:04:11.280> the<00:04:11.430> next<00:04:11.670> step<00:04:11.880> is<00:04:12.060> to<00:04:12.150> go<00:04:12.300> ahead<00:04:12.330> and

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:13.080 
then the next step is to go ahead and

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:17.690 
then the next step is to go ahead and
tighten<00:04:13.290> up<00:04:13.500> our<00:04:13.680> clamps<00:04:15.920> the<00:04:16.920> last<00:04:17.160> step<00:04:17.489> and

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:17.700 
tighten up our clamps the last step and

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:19.160 
tighten up our clamps the last step and
it's<00:04:17.850> a<00:04:17.910> very<00:04:18.090> important<00:04:18.600> one<00:04:18.690> that<00:04:18.750> we<00:04:18.900> don't

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:19.170 
it's a very important one that we don't

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:21.380 
it's a very important one that we don't
forget<00:04:19.500> and<00:04:19.980> that<00:04:20.160> is<00:04:20.400> to<00:04:20.640> remember<00:04:20.880> to<00:04:21.209> plug

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:21.390 
forget and that is to remember to plug

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:24.800 
forget and that is to remember to plug
in<00:04:21.630> the<00:04:22.110> sensor<00:04:23.360> and<00:04:24.360> there<00:04:24.480> you<00:04:24.600> have<00:04:24.630> it

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:24.810 
in the sensor and there you have it

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:27.380 
in the sensor and there you have it
that's<00:04:25.170> how<00:04:25.380> you<00:04:25.440> put<00:04:25.740> a<00:04:25.920> KN<00:04:26.520> air<00:04:26.790> intake

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:27.390 
that's how you put a KN air intake

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:31.640 
that's how you put a KN air intake
system<00:04:27.870> into<00:04:28.590> a<00:04:28.620> 2013<00:04:29.370> f-150<00:04:30.290> with<00:04:31.290> the<00:04:31.440> three

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:31.650 
system into a 2013 f-150 with the three

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:35.240 
system into a 2013 f-150 with the three
v<00:04:31.890> EcoBoost<00:04:32.550> turbo<00:04:32.910> engine
