 unstoppable tv point is my blog are 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.450
 several things bibliography we go with 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:54.099
 open to alfonso and señero results 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:55.959
 according to the weight of consuming 2500 calories 

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:58.030
 of the volume and you can complete me because 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:59.080
 I feel that there is no more good 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:00.459
 It really is the problem of many 

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:02.590
 people in the volume that send them 

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:04.750
 food like beasts that are sent to 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:06.550
 trade 78 quotes 10 meals then and 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:08.200
 people can not anymore everything is in 

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:10.090
 progress remember little by little let's go 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:11.410
 eating the volume success does not mean 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:13.450
 that one is going to eat a lot if more 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:14.860
 meals is gradually progressive from 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:16.150
 the same way if it becomes very difficult to eat 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:18.070
 solid food, I recommend that you 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:19.690
 you have shakes for example meals 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:20.859
 solid and the other shakes if you're a 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:22.780
 person who does not get so much food 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:25.720
 but remember that you should not eat every 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:27.430
 two or three hours every 45 hours this more 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:29.500
 ideal for you to stay stable and 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:31.600
 he does not remember to eat food anymore 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:32.889
 integers that keep you no longer here and 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:35.530
 you can also have consume your 

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:38.440
 your schedule that is fries 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:39.910

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:45.250
 increase more or more energy for 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:47.410
 train 5 if with the videos that I put 

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:48.700
 is of definition and volume because only 

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:50.770
 when you want, you just have to 

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:52.690
 vary the amounts if you go to alencar 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:54.100
 in a volume obviously you have more 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:55.660
 carbohydrates that pressure definition 

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:57.340
