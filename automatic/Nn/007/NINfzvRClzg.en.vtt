non-jews and what I think is so
wonderful<00:03:28.500> is<00:03:28.680> that<00:03:28.880> while<00:03:29.880> our<00:03:30.330> communities

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:31.080 
wonderful is that while our communities

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.410 
wonderful is that while our communities
have<00:03:31.350> much<00:03:31.650> that<00:03:31.920> we<00:03:32.010> disagree<00:03:32.220> about<00:03:32.640> we

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 
have much that we disagree about we

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:36.320 
have much that we disagree about we
agree<00:03:33.450> on<00:03:34.050> so<00:03:34.650> much<00:03:34.860> and<00:03:35.190> we<00:03:35.670> agree<00:03:36.060> when<00:03:36.239> it

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:36.330 
agree on so much and we agree when it

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:37.940 
agree on so much and we agree when it
comes<00:03:36.569> to<00:03:36.750> the<00:03:36.840> importance<00:03:37.290> of<00:03:37.410> the<00:03:37.530> Land<00:03:37.739> of

in<00:03:40.440> that<00:03:40.500> Israel<00:03:41.130> 365<00:03:41.970> it's<00:03:42.480> one<00:03:42.600> of<00:03:42.690> the<00:03:42.810> only
