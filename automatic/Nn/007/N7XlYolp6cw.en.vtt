00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 how about friends how are they up without sun 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:08.210
 in another gameplay of castlevania symphony 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:10.559
 of the night for the xbox 360 version 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:12.240
 this time I bring you a video for 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:16.230
 teach them how we can level up 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:18.720
 the muramasa weapon that says sword 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.000
 thirsty for blood and is for two hands 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.699
 here I have equipped what is the breastplate 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.160
 errant defense increases as the 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:28.850
 explored map and the layer of blood that 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.650
 turns the damage into hearts 

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:34.370
 on the right side I have what is the 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:38.690
 attack 24 and 24 because remember that you 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:40.820
 repeat and we will need what is the 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:43.280
 sub knife weapon we're going to 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:45.110
 be throwing throwing besides that 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:49.130
 I leave the location of the map so that 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:51.470
 see where this is done 

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:53.570
 this good trick this strategy of 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:56.180
 level up although it is somewhat repetitive 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:59.720
 I become a bat and here they 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:02.850
 I leave what is the enemy of the octopus the 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:05.060
 joke to be able to level up 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:09.840
 is to throw the knife to the enemies 

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:11.820
 but we have several advantages we have 256 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.340
 at heart every time we occupy a 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:17.369
 knife they lower us 1 but having 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.229
 equipped the blood layer the damage is 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:22.020
 turns into hearts and they raise us 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:25.470
 around 20 for each touch that we 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:27.590
 they do or for every damage that we 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.049
 the enemy hits us 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:31.520
 the strategy is approaching by 

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:34.250
 example and I get 22 every time I get 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:37.340
 22 were not stuck open heart 'the 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:39.170
 knife as fast as you can and as 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:42.260
 that the floor dropped blood and if I'm 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:44.450
 close to me 8 life will sink 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:47.280
 and so we can know if we are going up 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:49.440
 the level of our armor 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.580
 very good and I'm doing it 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:53.710
 fast fast fast 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:57.630
 although they hit me many times but not 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:57.630
 it matters because if I recover the hearts 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:05.110
 to wind stabbing blade 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:06.790
 knife do not sell much green 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:09.850
 is that the weapon is leveling me up 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:11.890
 in addition to that he recovered life 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:14.350
 we have many windows because for a 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:18.750
 side we recover life we are stuck and 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:22.620
 we recover heart is very easy so 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.620
 remember that we have 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:28.210
 well we started with 24 power with the 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:32.190
 arma a muramasa we only have equipped what 

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:36.670
 what is the errant breastplate and the mantle 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:38.650
 layer blood so gud 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.000
 that later we can climb very well with 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:41.980
 other objects 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:47.380
 here what I do is launch 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:49.910
 throw them give them blood and so we can 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:55.880
 know if we are doing well 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:59.510
 fast fast and every time I get stuck on 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:02.220
 hearts that I like because we do not have 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:03.810
 to occupy next 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.640
 we do not have to be holding the 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:07.470
 hearts that we no longer see 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.540
 you need 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:12.930
 with the simple fact that they hit us already 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:15.980
 we already recovered clouds the hearts and 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:19.099
 so we can throw the knives 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:21.620
 Fast fast and fast pm but no 

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:23.290
 it matters because it also recovers 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:25.970
 miles why 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:30.040
 every night 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:30.040
 my life will look very life and heart 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:34.580
 although they put 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:40.270
 here do not return me again appear the 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:43.290
 same that does not matter in unique there 

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:45.150
 many and I think 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:48.110
 for example there is supposed to be no longer 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:48.110
 there was and again 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:57.180
 It is important that when we kill the 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:04:01.410
 enemy be a little bit close to sing without 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:05.300
 get to the point that it touches us and so 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:05.300
 trigger the blood for the default more 

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:21.120
 to recover hearts in the law 22 29 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:24.449
 before the sandwich and they hit me 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:29.430
 sometimes it 's a little tired shocked good 

00:04:24.449 --> 00:04:33.290
 crashes at the best it bothers them but then 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:33.290
 so we can go up from level 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:41.650
 we got a good video you in a 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:41.650
 long video for them to see 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:46.490
 we have to get closer 

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:58.800
 two 

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:05.930
 knife as much as you can 

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:14.340
 Let's find out that Monica 

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:34.139
 they move a bit the strategy to 

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:37.560
 put in common and they can do it 

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:39.840
 class I left the location here 

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:41.510
 it is already the second part of the castle 

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:43.880
 what is mine 

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:46.010
 is the castle inverted here we can 

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:50.560
 find these enemies and the location 

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:50.560
 of the clues at the beginning 

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:58.470
 remember that the blood must fall 

00:05:54.840 --> 00:06:00.800
 and you should leave the number in my house number 

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:00.800
 8 

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:07.700
 and so I can know that I'm going up from 

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:10.160
 level my weapon very ranges in videos 

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:12.919
 previous I got it by killing the 

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:17.050
 enemy but if you can watch the video 

00:06:12.919 --> 00:06:17.050
 see it to give you an idea 

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:32.380
 but while this one is with follow 

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:32.380
 operating with the enemy 

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:38.300
 the video in case you want to see how 

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:39.800
 get a lot more and good what 

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:42.850
 important part of this video is that we 

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:42.850
 bring blood the blood 

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:54.040
 For example, there is an attack of 

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:57.370
 and of attack I already have 55 as it is a weapon 

00:06:54.040 --> 00:07:01.150
 of two hands I have 55 and 55 

00:06:57.370 --> 00:07:05.229
 we started with 23 94 and I do not remember 

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:08.229
 and so we can raise the level 

00:07:05.229 --> 00:07:08.229
 we 

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:13.820
 fast to madness 

00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:17.180
 I hope you liked the guide for 

00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:19.850
 go up a level muramasa plot like if you 

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:23.380
 liked in videos for more videos and nothing 

00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:23.380
 we do not wait anymore on the next level 

00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:30.699
 so much that I was in his life 

00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:41.360
 I'm level 57 level ups and then 

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:44.330
 nothing I hope you liked the video 

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:46.879
 like if you liked sub for more videos and 

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:50.740
 Here I leave the location of the video a 

00:07:46.879 --> 00:07:50.740
 greeting and you are very well
