features<00:00:41.969> one<00:00:42.510> thing<00:00:42.750> I<00:00:42.899> like<00:00:43.170> about<00:00:43.200> this<00:00:43.710> is

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
features one thing I like about this is

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.700 
features one thing I like about this is
right<00:00:44.820> here<00:00:45.210> there's<00:00:45.989> two<00:00:46.140> different<00:00:46.260> volume

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
right here there's two different volume

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.220 
right here there's two different volume
options<00:00:47.100> so<00:00:47.879> if<00:00:47.940> it's<00:00:48.059> a<00:00:48.120> little<00:00:48.329> loud<00:00:48.480> you<00:00:49.079> can

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
options so if it's a little loud you can

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.590 
options so if it's a little loud you can
turn<00:00:49.410> it<00:00:49.530> down<00:00:49.559> I<00:00:49.980> think<00:00:50.910> far<00:00:51.120> too<00:00:51.270> many<00:00:51.360> kid

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
turn it down I think far too many kid

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.260 
turn it down I think far too many kid
toys<00:00:51.780> don't<00:00:52.140> have<00:00:52.260> that<00:00:52.469> option<00:00:52.680> for

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:53.270 
toys don't have that option for

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:55.850 
toys don't have that option for
demonstration<00:00:54.270> purposes<00:00:54.660> I'll<00:00:55.500> have<00:00:55.710> it<00:00:55.800> on

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
demonstration purposes I'll have it on

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:03.529 
demonstration purposes I'll have it on
the<00:00:55.949> loudest<00:00:56.309> setting<00:01:01.969> so<00:01:02.969> it<00:01:03.059> encourages<00:01:03.449> you

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
the loudest setting so it encourages you

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.090 
the loudest setting so it encourages you
to<00:01:03.600> go<00:01:03.750> to<00:01:03.809> the<00:01:03.870> website<00:01:04.260> to<00:01:04.619> download
