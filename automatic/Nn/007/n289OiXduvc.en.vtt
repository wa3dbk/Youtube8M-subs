00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
each video so today I thought about

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.560 
each video so today I thought about
reviewing<00:00:24.720> accelerate<00:00:25.470> and<00:00:26.460> there's<00:00:27.090> special

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
reviewing accelerate and there's special

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.169 
reviewing accelerate and there's special
reason<00:00:27.930> for<00:00:28.080> that<00:00:28.170> the<00:00:28.920> reason<00:00:28.949> why<00:00:29.279> I<00:00:29.580> am

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
reason for that the reason why I am

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.630 
reason for that the reason why I am
revealing<00:00:30.750> accelerate<00:00:31.500> before<00:00:32.279> any<00:00:32.399> of<00:00:32.460> those

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
revealing accelerate before any of those

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.229 
revealing accelerate before any of those
is<00:00:33.360> because<00:00:33.750> I<00:00:33.899> got<00:00:34.140> this<00:00:34.760> silly<00:00:35.760> rate<00:00:35.969> a

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239

get onto the review of accelerate

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.090 
get onto the review of accelerate
okay<00:01:25.830> so<00:01:26.759> accelerates<00:01:27.509> head<00:01:27.780> can<00:01:28.020> move<00:01:28.100> 360

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
okay so accelerates head can move 360

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:37.460 
okay so accelerates head can move 360
degrees<00:01:30.979> his<00:01:31.979> helmet<00:01:32.430> can<00:01:32.700> pop<00:01:33.270> off<00:01:33.950> and<00:01:36.470> and
