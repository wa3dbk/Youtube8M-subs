down in there and it still allows you to
have<00:00:45.149> that<00:00:45.269> little<00:00:45.449> bit<00:00:45.569> of<00:00:45.780> bounce<00:00:45.960> forward

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
have that little bit of bounce forward

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.799 
have that little bit of bounce forward
and<00:00:46.859> that's<00:00:47.760> what<00:00:47.940> I<00:00:48.030> love<00:00:48.300> about<00:00:48.329> it<00:00:48.690> the<00:00:48.780> most

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
and that's what I love about it the most

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.049 
and that's what I love about it the most
is<00:00:49.199> that<00:00:49.229> you<00:00:49.890> know<00:00:49.979> can<00:00:50.190> have<00:00:50.670> that<00:00:50.819> bounce

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
is that you know can have that bounce

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:52.579 
is that you know can have that bounce
forward<00:00:51.569> on<00:00:51.659> your<00:00:51.690> toes<00:00:52.019> but<00:00:52.260> at<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:52.440> same

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:52.589 
forward on your toes but at the same

00:00:52.589 --> 00:00:54.739 
forward on your toes but at the same
time<00:00:52.859> it's<00:00:53.100> got<00:00:53.219> that<00:00:53.429> that<00:00:53.969> stiffness<00:00:54.539> the

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:54.749 
time it's got that that stiffness the

00:00:54.749 --> 00:00:57.139 
time it's got that that stiffness the
stability<00:00:55.350> that<00:00:55.499> maybe<00:00:56.489> when<00:00:56.969> you're<00:00:57.120> a

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
stability that maybe when you're a

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.329 
stability that maybe when you're a
little<00:00:57.719> off<00:00:57.870> balance<00:00:58.289> escaping<00:00:58.889> your<00:00:59.100> skate

00:00:59.329 --> 00:00:59.339 
little off balance escaping your skate

00:00:59.339 --> 00:01:01.309 
little off balance escaping your skate
is<00:00:59.460> helping<00:00:59.789> you<00:00:59.969> you<00:01:00.269> know<00:01:00.510> stay<00:01:00.749> on<00:01:00.960> and<00:01:01.139> stay

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:01.319

they<00:01:19.070> were<00:01:19.130> great<00:01:19.460> you<00:01:20.240> know<00:01:20.330> operate<00:01:20.750> into

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:20.930 
they were great you know operate into

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:22.450 
they were great you know operate into
them<00:01:21.050> normally<00:01:21.440> it's<00:01:21.560> problem<00:01:21.950> for<00:01:22.040> me<00:01:22.160> is<00:01:22.250> to

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:22.460 
them normally it's problem for me is to

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.960 
them normally it's problem for me is to
break<00:01:22.970> them<00:01:23.120> in<00:01:23.300> it's<00:01:23.690> a<00:01:23.780> bit<00:01:23.930> of<00:01:24.020> time<00:01:24.200> but<00:01:24.440> I

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:24.970 
break them in it's a bit of time but I

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:27.100 
break them in it's a bit of time but I
was<00:01:25.970> able<00:01:26.060> to<00:01:26.210> get<00:01:26.330> into<00:01:26.510> them<00:01:26.660> really<00:01:26.870> quickly

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:27.110 
was able to get into them really quickly

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:29.110 
was able to get into them really quickly
and<00:01:27.410> they're<00:01:27.530> comfortable<00:01:27.950> and<00:01:28.340> and<00:01:28.730> super

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:29.120 
and they're comfortable and and super

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:30.160 
and they're comfortable and and super
light<00:01:29.300> they're<00:01:29.570> you<00:01:29.780> know<00:01:29.840> they're<00:01:30.020> really

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:30.170 
light they're you know they're really

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:34.480 
light they're you know they're really
light<00:01:30.470> skate<00:01:30.770> the<00:01:31.100> 195<00:01:32.090> was<00:01:32.390> all<00:01:32.540> about<00:01:33.490> making

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:34.490 
light skate the 195 was all about making

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:36.610 
light skate the 195 was all about making
small<00:01:34.940> Corrections<00:01:35.570> to<00:01:35.870> to<00:01:36.260> some<00:01:36.470> of<00:01:36.560> the

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:36.620 
small Corrections to to some of the

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:39.970 
small Corrections to to some of the
areas<00:01:36.770> where<00:01:37.250> the<00:01:38.150> 190<00:01:38.740> could<00:01:39.740> have<00:01:39.830> been

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:39.980 
areas where the 190 could have been

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:41.770 
areas where the 190 could have been
better<00:01:40.130> the<00:01:40.550> biggest<00:01:40.880> difference<00:01:41.330> I<00:01:41.540> would

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:41.780 
better the biggest difference I would

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:47.050 
better the biggest difference I would
say<00:01:43.780> mostly<00:01:44.780> in<00:01:45.200> terms<00:01:45.530> of<00:01:45.800> the<00:01:46.220> fit<00:01:46.460> dialing

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:47.060 
say mostly in terms of the fit dialing

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:52.270 
say mostly in terms of the fit dialing
the<00:01:48.020> fit<00:01:48.350> in<00:01:48.610> to<00:01:49.610> allow<00:01:50.420> the<00:01:50.479> 195<00:01:51.320> to<00:01:51.530> fit<00:01:51.800> as

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
the fit in to allow the 195 to fit as

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.310 
the fit in to allow the 195 to fit as
many<00:01:52.550> players<00:01:52.880> as<00:01:53.030> possible<00:01:53.240> and<00:01:53.960> that's<00:01:54.110> what

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:54.320 
many players as possible and that's what

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.200 
many players as possible and that's what
we<00:01:54.380> were<00:01:54.470> aiming<00:01:54.800> for<00:01:54.979> with<00:01:55.700> the<00:01:55.850> changes<00:01:56.180> that

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:56.210 
we were aiming for with the changes that

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:02.710 
we were aiming for with the changes that
we're<00:01:56.450> done<00:01:56.570> with<00:01:56.720> the<00:01:56.780> 195<00:01:57.410> I<00:02:01.510> try<00:02:02.510> to<00:02:02.570> be

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:02.720 
we're done with the 195 I try to be

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.469 
we're done with the 195 I try to be
powerful<00:02:03.080> I<00:02:03.470> think<00:02:03.830> that's<00:02:04.760> the<00:02:05.330> most

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479 
powerful I think that's the most

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:07.570 
powerful I think that's the most
important<00:02:05.960> thing<00:02:06.110> for<00:02:06.260> me<00:02:06.320> is<00:02:06.500> you<00:02:07.250> got<00:02:07.370> to<00:02:07.460> be

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:07.580 
important thing for me is you got to be

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:10.090 
important thing for me is you got to be
you<00:02:07.640> got<00:02:07.670> to<00:02:07.820> be<00:02:07.910> strong<00:02:08.800> don't<00:02:09.800> let<00:02:09.950> your

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:10.100 
you got to be strong don't let your

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:12.699 
you got to be strong don't let your
skates<00:02:10.369> strong<00:02:10.640> on<00:02:10.790> the<00:02:10.880> pocket<00:02:11.410> to<00:02:12.410> have<00:02:12.560> it

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:12.709 
skates strong on the pocket to have it

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:14.190 
skates strong on the pocket to have it
you<00:02:12.800> know<00:02:12.890> those<00:02:13.070> are<00:02:13.160> those<00:02:13.280> bursts<00:02:13.730> of<00:02:13.820> speed

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
you know those are those bursts of speed

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.530 
you know those are those bursts of speed
you<00:02:15.200> know<00:02:15.320> just<00:02:15.650> need<00:02:15.830> one<00:02:16.430> step<00:02:16.730> on<00:02:16.880> a<00:02:16.910> guy<00:02:17.150> and

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
you know just need one step on a guy and

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.040 
you know just need one step on a guy and
then<00:02:18.610> you're<00:02:19.610> strong<00:02:20.270> on<00:02:20.450> your<00:02:20.480> skates<00:02:20.840> and

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:21.050 
then you're strong on your skates and

wanted to represent the past the only
living<00:02:51.200> future<00:02:51.769> and<00:02:51.890> I<00:02:51.950> think<00:02:52.250> this<00:02:53.000> notion<00:02:53.209> of

ultimate futuristic technology and I

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:03.130 
ultimate futuristic technology and I
really<00:03:01.550> think<00:03:01.730> that<00:03:02.090> you<00:03:02.630> know<00:03:02.780> the<00:03:02.930> hockey
