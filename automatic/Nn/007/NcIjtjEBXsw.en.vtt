00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:20.460 
mixed feelings about this i think that

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:24.090 
mixed feelings about this i think that
it<00:05:21.460> does<00:05:21.760> a<00:05:21.790> good<00:05:21.970> job<00:05:22.030> in<00:05:22.510> terms<00:05:22.630> of<00:05:23.140> i'm<00:05:23.530> doing

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:24.100 
it does a good job in terms of i'm doing

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:25.800 
it does a good job in terms of i'm doing
what<00:05:24.220> it<00:05:24.340> says<00:05:24.550> it<00:05:24.670> does<00:05:24.700> like<00:05:25.090> minimizing

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:25.810 
what it says it does like minimizing

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:28.950 
what it says it does like minimizing
pores<00:05:26.320> and<00:05:27.070> fine<00:05:27.130> lines<00:05:27.600> but<00:05:28.600> the<00:05:28.750> thing<00:05:28.780> that

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:28.960 
pores and fine lines but the thing that

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:30.510 
pores and fine lines but the thing that
I<00:05:29.110> didn't<00:05:29.440> like<00:05:29.530> about<00:05:29.590> it<00:05:29.860> is<00:05:30.070> that<00:05:30.100> it<00:05:30.370> has

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:30.520 
I didn't like about it is that it has

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:33.030 
I didn't like about it is that it has
shimmer<00:05:30.880> in<00:05:31.210> it<00:05:31.390> and<00:05:31.660> so<00:05:32.260> this<00:05:32.470> shimmer<00:05:32.770> is

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:33.040 
shimmer in it and so this shimmer is

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:35.280 
shimmer in it and so this shimmer is
actually<00:05:33.400> a<00:05:33.430> bit<00:05:33.700> much<00:05:33.970> for<00:05:34.030> me<00:05:34.300> for<00:05:34.750> my<00:05:34.900> face

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:35.290 
actually a bit much for me for my face

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:38.910 
actually a bit much for me for my face
so<00:05:35.950> when<00:05:36.850> it<00:05:36.970> comes<00:05:37.180> to<00:05:37.390> a<00:05:37.420> BB<00:05:37.810> cream<00:05:37.990> I<00:05:38.290> don't

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:38.920 
so when it comes to a BB cream I don't

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:41.820 
so when it comes to a BB cream I don't
like<00:05:39.220> it<00:05:39.460> to<00:05:39.610> have<00:05:39.820> shimmer<00:05:40.330> in<00:05:40.540> it<00:05:40.690> or<00:05:41.020> glitter

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:41.830 
like it to have shimmer in it or glitter

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:43.710 
like it to have shimmer in it or glitter
or<00:05:42.130> of<00:05:42.250> any<00:05:42.520> type<00:05:42.790> I<00:05:42.970> don't<00:05:43.120> really<00:05:43.240> like<00:05:43.330> that

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:43.720 
or of any type I don't really like that

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:46.260
