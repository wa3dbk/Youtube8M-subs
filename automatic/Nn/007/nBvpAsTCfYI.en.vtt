00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
 hello guys and welcome I undergo dramas 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:04.230
 the channel that deals with bacteria e 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:05.850
 surroundings 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.429
 today we talk about how to increase the 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.860
 speed at the hands and feet at 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.630
 battery of course, here we are 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.830
 let's start let's go straight to the 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.240
 core of the matter 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.449
 very often we find ourselves doing 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:21.300
 hand speed exercises there 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:24.060
 we put ourselves there in a room 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.570
 in front of our battery 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.570
 lights off 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:29.920
 38 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:30.960
 not only 

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:35.879
 Hello 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:40.860
 unfortunately subjected so far to go 

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:44.399
 to 270 thousand souls but metronome of the 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:47.040
 sometimes we don't have the right time a 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:52.409
 do this exercise because maybe later 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:54.269
 a little bored is a bit monotonous 0 1 and 2 

00:00:52.409 --> 00:00:56.970
 3 etc. etc. 

00:00:54.269 --> 00:00:59.909
 and so on, all of us drummers do 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:02.149
 this thing how to do though 

00:00:59.909 --> 00:01:05.670
 make this exercise a little more 

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:07.560
 nice and at the same time do it 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.720
 last as long as it takes 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.399
 to increase our capabilities 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:16.140
 I followed several clinics of 

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:18.479
 famous drummers and to whom I addressed 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:22.380
 this question because I saw myself 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:25.320
 really that they were going to come for 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:29.159
 get your hands and feet too much and get them me 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:32.069
 they simply replied then 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:34.409
 you have to put the institutes on me 

00:01:32.069 --> 00:01:37.200
 like to watch the game and horror movies 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:40.979
 what you love what you love to look at you 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.270
 put there in front of the television there is 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.659
 your favorite game 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.430
 put the game in front of the deal there and 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.640
 during the game 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:52.800
 the actress will never be there 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:55.230
 watching the game you feel the time 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:57.690
 with your feet or feel flickr or 

00:01:55.230 --> 00:02:00.420
 rey that or do as you like and do 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:01.850
 the exercise for the duration of the 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:06.000
 game 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:08.970
 make two double copies make single strokes 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.860
 alternating a little bit of course you do 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.230
 at least last every figure at least three 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:16.680
 You have four minutes so long 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:19.560
 changed every 4 minutes 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:21.510
 first figure do in the new sixteenths 1 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.560
 you can do 2 to 2 then let them talk about 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.270
 edolo and so on 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.910
 what do you have the foot pad for 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:30.000
 was also losing fatigue exercises for 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:32.160
 the foot during the game same thing 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.250
 if you love the movie way to put a 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:38.459
 horror movies and vvvvvv do exercises I 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:42.150
 many times I found myself doing it with 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:43.590
 music even that hands a little bit 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:47.420
 nicer instead of staying at 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:47.420
 silence a bomber 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:57.250
 that after a quarter of an hour 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:59.650
 do what you like in the exercises e 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:01.210
 when you do because otherwise I call 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:05.440
 our growing on the battery 

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:07.270
 so exercise have done and after later 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:10.210
 he cazzeggiano by the vice ball 

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:12.760
 I decided how it works with music 

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:15.490
 music works if you do one 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:16.209
 playlist of the songs you like 

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:17.950
 more 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:20.170
 obviously I advise you to put 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:22.360
 those first the slower songs and then 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:26.610
 the songs in the first fastest fourth 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:26.610
 song made in the sixteenths 11 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:34.239
 obviously the used time as well of 

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:37.630
 very simple song song below and 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:39.070
 you in time with the song is a second one 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:41.440
 song 

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:44.830
 let's make a paradise for the whole 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:46.780
 second song and make heaven at the same time 

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:50.230
 of the song is so on 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:52.239
 and each song takes a different shape 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:55.720
 and so also with the foot you put the 

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:57.850
 quad if you have the pad to make the cash and 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:59.440
 away or if you have the battery peaks 

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:02.110
 music in the ears you do 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:03.930
 foot exercises as you like boys 

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:07.120
 this we say a good method to 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:07.810
 increase our capacity to the hands and 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.209
 at the feet 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:12.940
 let's say it's a little bit nicer than that 

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:16.770
 stay freely 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:16.770
 after all turned off 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:23.330
 if something moves you put the 

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:26.030
 music you put the game put me 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:29.330
 the movie what the hell do you like about it 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:31.880
 more and do the exercise then after exercises 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:35.180
 go to the complete set 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:37.310
 an advice that I give you now also 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:39.650
 when you do drums 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:42.380
 full battery and do maybe in a 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:45.410
 rhythm concerns thesis to carry on that 

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:48.350
 pace for at least four minutes because 

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:50.750
 four minutes and not a minute as much as one 

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:52.460
 time I have it because you guys keep it 

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:55.670
 I realize that later when he was playing in a band 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:57.050
 the average duration of an average piece is 4 

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:59.120
 minutes so you have to be 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:02.600
 concentrate for 4 minutes on that rhythm 

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:05.230
 so when you study a rhythm and one 

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:07.580
 once you have it in your hands for good 

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:11.150
 carried on for 4 minutes 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:12.650
 here is how to develop hands speed 

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:15.290
 at the feet 

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:17.150
 I hope this is useful for you 

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:20.120
 I recommend let me know you there how 

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:24.170
 or if you have found others 

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:26.600
 other methods for studying and not 

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:31.760
 write below if you liked the 

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:34.760
 video and advice I like mine 

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:36.800
 like it below and follow me on facebook 

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:39.050

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:43.030
 messages and a bit really a bit of a finger 

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:48.270
