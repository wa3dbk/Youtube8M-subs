going to have a couple of things in mind

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:41.990 
going to have a couple of things in mind
one<00:00:40.350> of<00:00:40.379> them<00:00:40.620> is<00:00:40.829> hygiene<00:00:41.399> that's<00:00:41.730> a<00:00:41.850> major

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
these she'll also use these spatulas now

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.100 
these she'll also use these spatulas now
it<00:00:47.460> should<00:00:47.640> use<00:00:47.820> these<00:00:48.030> to<00:00:48.210> dip<00:00:48.360> into<00:00:48.660> the<00:00:48.960> wax

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
it should use these to dip into the wax

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.959 
it should use these to dip into the wax
port<00:00:49.590> which<00:00:49.770> will<00:00:49.920> use<00:00:50.100> a<00:00:50.129> fresh<00:00:50.460> one<00:00:50.700> each

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
port which will use a fresh one each

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.080 
port which will use a fresh one each
time<00:00:51.360> that's<00:00:52.140> to<00:00:52.469> store<00:00:52.710> things<00:00:53.250> like<00:00:53.340> MRA<00:00:53.940> C

and other bacterial infections cross

00:00:56.989 --> 00:00:59.270 
and other bacterial infections cross
contaminating<00:00:57.989> so<00:00:58.559> that's<00:00:58.739> an<00:00:58.859> important

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280
