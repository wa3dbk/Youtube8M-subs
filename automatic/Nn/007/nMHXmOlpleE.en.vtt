00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
many years more than a year before we

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:25.820 
many years more than a year before we
run<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:24.900> first<00:01:25.049> test<00:01:25.320> car<00:01:25.560> we<00:01:25.740> were

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
run the first test car we were

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.649 
run the first test car we were
developing<00:01:25.979> the<00:01:26.310> vehicle<00:01:26.580> dynamics<00:01:26.970> in<00:01:27.570> the
