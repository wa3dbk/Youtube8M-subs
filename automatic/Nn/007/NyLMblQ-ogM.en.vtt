00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
right foot on the rear brake now he's

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.460 
right foot on the rear brake now he's
using<00:01:48.840> clutch<00:01:49.530> rear<00:01:50.460> brake<00:01:50.730> and<00:01:51.000> throttle<00:01:51.470> to

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
try to get moving again it's quite a

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:55.640 
try to get moving again it's quite a
difficult<00:01:54.660> Hill<00:01:55.050> so<00:01:55.320> I<00:01:55.350> wouldn't<00:01:55.620> be

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:55.650 
difficult Hill so I wouldn't be

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:57.440 
difficult Hill so I wouldn't be
surprised<00:01:56.100> if<00:01:56.400> he<00:01:56.520> can't<00:01:56.760> actually<00:01:56.940> get<00:01:57.180> going

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
surprised if he can't actually get going

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.540 
surprised if he can't actually get going
from<00:01:57.690> there<00:01:57.840> is<00:01:58.410> in<00:01:58.590> probably<00:01:58.920> the<00:01:58.950> worst<00:01:59.220> spot

00:01:59.540 --> 00:01:59.550 
from there is in probably the worst spot

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:02.210 
from there is in probably the worst spot
on<00:01:59.670> the<00:01:59.790> hill<00:01:59.970> so<00:02:00.750> na<00:02:01.080> looks<00:02:01.710> like<00:02:01.890> he's<00:02:02.040> going

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:02.220 
on the hill so na looks like he's going

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:05.570 
on the hill so na looks like he's going
to<00:02:02.630> turn<00:02:03.630> around<00:02:03.890> watch<00:02:04.890> as<00:02:05.010> he<00:02:05.130> chemise<00:02:05.460> the
