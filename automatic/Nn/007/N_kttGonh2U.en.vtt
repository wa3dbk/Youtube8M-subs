00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:03.990 
so just a quick demo of what's new in

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:05.749 
so just a quick demo of what's new in
this<00:00:04.470> version<00:00:04.560> of<00:00:04.830> the<00:00:04.890> software<00:00:05.130> the

00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:05.759 
this version of the software the

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:08.870 
this version of the software the
original<00:00:07.309> touchscreen<00:00:08.309> video<00:00:08.580> that<00:00:08.760> I<00:00:08.790> took

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880 
original touchscreen video that I took

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.900 
original touchscreen video that I took
was<00:00:09.210> on<00:00:09.360> version<00:00:09.570> 1.9<00:00:10.170> point<00:00:10.349> 11<00:00:11.280> I'm<00:00:11.700> now

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
was on version 1.9 point 11 I'm now

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.839 
was on version 1.9 point 11 I'm now
running<00:00:12.090> version<00:00:12.450> one<00:00:12.719> point<00:00:12.960> 15.8<00:00:13.849> which

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
running version one point 15.8 which

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.359 
running version one point 15.8 which
includes<00:00:15.210> a<00:00:15.480> few<00:00:16.020> new<00:00:16.560> things<00:00:16.590> that<00:00:17.070> I<00:00:17.190> thought

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
includes a few new things that I thought

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.140 
includes a few new things that I thought
I<00:00:17.430> would<00:00:17.580> quickly<00:00:17.820> cover<00:00:18.119> here<00:00:19.580> first<00:00:20.580> and

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
I would quickly cover here first and

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:22.609 
I would quickly cover here first and
quickest<00:00:21.660> thing<00:00:21.720> to<00:00:21.990> show<00:00:22.140> will<00:00:22.410> be<00:00:22.500> the

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
quickest thing to show will be the

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:28.400 
quickest thing to show will be the
volume<00:00:25.580> if<00:00:26.580> you<00:00:26.849> tap<00:00:27.480> on<00:00:27.599> the<00:00:27.660> volume<00:00:27.990> here

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
volume if you tap on the volume here

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.519 
volume if you tap on the volume here
you'll<00:00:29.039> notice<00:00:29.220> that<00:00:29.400> each<00:00:29.699> tap<00:00:30.000> does<00:00:30.240> not

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:30.529 
you'll notice that each tap does not

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:34.840 
you'll notice that each tap does not
increment<00:00:31.529> the<00:00:31.619> number<00:00:31.679> by<00:00:32.329> an<00:00:33.329> integer<00:00:34.230> so

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:34.850 
increment the number by an integer so

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:37.700 
increment the number by an integer so
it's<00:00:35.850> a<00:00:36.030> it's<00:00:36.300> a<00:00:36.390> much<00:00:36.600> smoother<00:00:37.050> progression

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
it's a it's a much smoother progression

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:44.020 
it's a it's a much smoother progression
from<00:00:38.010> from<00:00:38.550> you<00:00:38.790> to<00:00:39.180> 11<00:00:41.989> works<00:00:42.989> great<00:00:43.379> love<00:00:43.860> it

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:44.030 
from from you to 11 works great love it

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:50.569 
from from you to 11 works great love it
and<00:00:46.190> now<00:00:47.190> if<00:00:47.309> we<00:00:47.399> move<00:00:47.640> into<00:00:49.070> driver<00:00:50.070> profile

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
and now if we move into driver profile

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:51.889 
and now if we move into driver profile
so<00:00:50.820> we've<00:00:50.910> got<00:00:51.059> this<00:00:51.180> new<00:00:51.390> icon<00:00:51.750> up<00:00:51.870> here

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
so we've got this new icon up here

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.439 
so we've got this new icon up here
you'll<00:00:52.860> see<00:00:52.949> I<00:00:53.100> have<00:00:53.219> a<00:00:53.309> driver<00:00:53.640> profile<00:00:54.149> for

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
you'll see I have a driver profile for

00:00:54.449 --> 00:01:02.420 
you'll see I have a driver profile for
myself<00:00:54.899> I<00:01:00.289> probably<00:01:01.289> can't<00:01:01.739> make<00:01:01.859> use<00:01:02.250> of<00:01:02.309> that

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
myself I probably can't make use of that

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.719 
myself I probably can't make use of that

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.390 
charging and sort of off so let me go
wondered<00:01:10.200> what<00:01:10.500> if<00:01:10.590> i<00:01:10.680> just<00:01:10.710> stop<00:01:11.189> the

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
wondered what if i just stop the

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:20.760 
wondered what if i just stop the
charging<00:01:11.850> from<00:01:11.970> in<00:01:12.119> here<00:01:12.330> that'll<00:01:12.630> be<00:01:12.720> enough

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:20.770 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:23.170 

the<00:01:21.770> car<00:01:21.950> bro<00:01:22.130> needs<00:01:22.340> to<00:01:22.460> be<00:01:22.550> on<00:01:22.670> my<00:01:22.850> child<00:01:23.090> to

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:40.210 
the car bro needs to be on my child to
disconnect<00:01:38.500> and<00:01:39.500> it's<00:01:39.650> quite<00:01:39.800> possible<00:01:39.980> that

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:40.220 
disconnect and it's quite possible that

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:43.930 
disconnect and it's quite possible that
i'm<00:01:40.400> still<00:01:40.640> getting<00:01:40.730> the<00:01:41.120> same<00:01:42.550> cuz<00:01:43.550> the<00:01:43.700> car

this will be at the top and I've noticed

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:47.250 
this will be at the top and I've noticed
that<00:03:42.470> they<00:03:43.010> removed<00:03:43.400> the<00:03:43.490> ability<00:03:43.850> to<00:03:44.060> touch

apparently<00:03:48.260> hit<00:03:48.560> touching<00:03:48.890> the<00:03:48.950> red<00:03:49.100> bar<00:03:49.280> will

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:49.490 
apparently hit touching the red bar will

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:51.850 
apparently hit touching the red bar will
cause<00:03:49.640> it<00:03:49.820> to<00:03:49.850> go<00:03:50.030> away<00:03:50.060> but<00:03:50.200> touching<00:03:51.200> the<00:03:51.500> you

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:51.860 
cause it to go away but touching the you

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:55.480

neutral<00:04:38.390> for<00:04:38.570> that<00:04:38.660> matter<00:04:38.840> oh<00:04:41.050> um<00:04:42.400> and<00:04:43.400> this

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:43.640 
neutral for that matter oh um and this

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:45.840 
neutral for that matter oh um and this
area<00:04:43.970> has<00:04:44.090> changed<00:04:44.390> a<00:04:44.450> little<00:04:44.510> bit<00:04:44.720> so<00:04:45.380> we<00:04:45.500> have

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:45.850 
area has changed a little bit so we have

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:53.559 
area has changed a little bit so we have
separated<00:04:46.850> lock<00:04:47.150> and<00:04:47.870> unlock

00:04:53.559 --> 00:04:53.569 

00:04:53.569 --> 00:04:59.079 

and<00:04:54.169> I<00:04:54.409> think<00:04:54.499> that<00:04:54.999> covers<00:04:55.999> it<00:04:56.149> for<00:04:58.089> changes

00:04:59.079 --> 00:04:59.089 
and I think that covers it for changes

00:04:59.089 --> 00:05:02.379 
and I think that covers it for changes
to<00:04:59.270> these<00:04:59.479> areas<00:05:00.469> I<00:05:00.919> quickly<00:05:01.639> go<00:05:01.909> through<00:05:01.939> here

00:05:02.379 --> 00:05:02.389 
to these areas I quickly go through here

00:05:02.389 --> 00:05:05.529 
to these areas I quickly go through here
and<00:05:02.569> don't<00:05:02.719> think<00:05:02.869> anything<00:05:04.330> here<00:05:05.330> has

00:05:05.529 --> 00:05:05.539 
and don't think anything here has

00:05:05.539 --> 00:05:09.699 
and don't think anything here has
changed<00:05:06.759> and<00:05:07.759> in<00:05:07.939> settings<00:05:08.569> of<00:05:09.199> course<00:05:09.439> driver

00:05:09.699 --> 00:05:09.709 
changed and in settings of course driver

00:05:09.709 --> 00:05:14.820 
changed and in settings of course driver
profiles<00:05:10.279> as<00:05:10.550> new<00:05:10.909> this<00:05:11.919> I<00:05:13.179> don't<00:05:14.179> believe<00:05:14.330> has

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:14.830 
profiles as new this I don't believe has
