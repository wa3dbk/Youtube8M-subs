like this touch screen feature however I
can<00:01:45.840> see<00:01:46.229> it<00:01:46.350> becoming<00:01:46.680> problematic<00:01:46.920> when

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
can see it becoming problematic when

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.719 
can see it becoming problematic when
driving<00:01:48.439> the<00:01:49.439> cars<00:01:49.649> are<00:01:49.890> reasonably<00:01:50.280> spacious

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729

driving the cars are reasonably spacious
feel<00:01:50.939> to<00:01:51.149> it<00:01:51.210> in<00:01:51.299> the<00:01:51.390> back

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
feel to it in the back

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.149 
feel to it in the back
however<00:01:52.140> it's<00:01:52.380> when<00:01:52.530> you<00:01:52.619> get<00:01:52.770> to<00:01:52.890> the<00:01:52.950> boot

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
however it's when you get to the boot

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:54.620 
however it's when you get to the boot
that<00:01:53.369> you<00:01:53.430> can<00:01:53.610> see<00:01:53.820> where<00:01:54.000> the<00:01:54.090> cutbacks<00:01:54.479> have

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
that you can see where the cutbacks have

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.980 
that you can see where the cutbacks have
been<00:01:54.780> made<00:01:55.850> the<00:01:56.850> boot<00:01:57.060> cover<00:01:57.299> just<00:01:57.509> feels<00:01:57.810> very

been made the boot cover just feels very

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.139 
been made the boot cover just feels very
flimsy<00:01:58.259> and<00:01:58.590> the<00:01:59.219> stays<00:01:59.460> come<00:01:59.759> off<00:01:59.909> very

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
flimsy and the stays come off very

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:03.469 
flimsy and the stays come off very
easily<00:02:00.619> the<00:02:01.619> boot<00:02:01.829> itself<00:02:02.189> isn't<00:02:02.880> a<00:02:02.969> bad<00:02:03.180> size

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
easily the boot itself isn't a bad size

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.660 
easily the boot itself isn't a bad size
however<00:02:04.170> it's<00:02:04.350> very<00:02:04.409> awkward<00:02:05.009> to<00:02:05.159> use<00:02:05.340> with<00:02:05.640> a
