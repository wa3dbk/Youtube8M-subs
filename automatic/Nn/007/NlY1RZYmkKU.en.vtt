let me show you guys an example to help
us<00:00:14.670> understand<00:00:15.240> what's<00:00:15.570> going<00:00:15.960> down

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
us understand what's going down

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.230 
us understand what's going down
and<00:00:16.379> how<00:00:16.770> would<00:00:16.980> write<00:00:17.460> up<00:00:17.490> a<00:00:17.730> general

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
and how would write up a general

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.050 
and how would write up a general
formulas<00:00:18.770> so<00:00:19.770> again<00:00:20.430> this<00:00:20.640> is<00:00:20.789> just<00:00:20.939> my

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
formulas so again this is just my

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.090 
formulas so again this is just my
samples<00:00:21.810> that's<00:00:22.199> going<00:00:22.439> to<00:00:22.529> help<00:00:22.650> us<00:00:22.830> to

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
samples that's going to help us to

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.300 
samples that's going to help us to
understand<00:00:23.640> what's<00:00:23.850> going<00:00:23.970> on

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:25.310 
understand what's going on

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:29.150 
understand what's going on
the<00:00:26.330> typical<00:00:27.330> part<00:00:27.570> in<00:00:27.689> algebra<00:00:28.140> is<00:00:28.199> you<00:00:29.039> are

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
the typical part in algebra is you are

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.759 
the typical part in algebra is you are
dealing<00:00:29.310> with<00:00:29.519> variables<00:00:30.300> so<00:00:31.260> to<00:00:31.320> help<00:00:31.619> us

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
dealing with variables so to help us

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.290 
dealing with variables so to help us
understand<00:00:32.399> what's<00:00:32.640> going<00:00:32.910> on

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
understand what's going on

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.510 
understand what's going on
that's<00:00:33.660> use<00:00:33.899> some<00:00:34.140> concrete<00:00:34.469> numbers<00:00:34.590> all

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
that's use some concrete numbers all

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.700 
that's use some concrete numbers all
right<00:00:35.880> so<00:00:36.510> let's<00:00:36.690> say<00:00:37.550> if<00:00:38.550> I<00:00:38.790> have<00:00:38.910> four<00:00:39.210> apples

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:39.710 
right so let's say if I have four apples

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:46.520 
right so let's say if I have four apples
and<00:00:41.510> it<00:00:42.510> cost<00:00:44.570> that's<00:00:45.570> a<00:00:45.719> three<00:00:46.260> hundred

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
and it cost that's a three hundred

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:52.520 
and it cost that's a three hundred
twenty<00:00:46.680> cents<00:00:49.250> okay<00:00:50.300> what's<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:51.480> formula<00:00:51.840> how

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
twenty cents okay what's the formula how

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.479 
twenty cents okay what's the formula how
much<00:00:52.770> we<00:00:53.190> will<00:00:53.489> be<00:00:53.520> it<00:00:54.210> won't<00:00:54.510> buy<00:00:55.190> also<00:00:56.190> say

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
much we will be it won't buy also say

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:05.380 
much we will be it won't buy also say
how<00:00:57.420> much<00:00:58.430> will<00:00:59.430> you<00:00:59.609> be<00:01:01.100> if<00:01:02.100> I<00:01:02.550> want<00:01:03.559> let's<00:01:04.559> say

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:05.390 
how much will you be if I want let's say

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:11.990 
how much will you be if I want let's say
seven<00:01:06.390> apples<00:01:09.020> okay<00:01:10.520> so<00:01:11.520> let's<00:01:11.670> see<00:01:11.760> how<00:01:11.850> do<00:01:11.909> we

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
seven apples okay so let's see how do we

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.210 
seven apples okay so let's see how do we
do<00:01:12.180> this<00:01:12.360> and<00:01:12.600> again<00:01:13.320> I'm<00:01:13.500> gonna<00:01:13.710> ignore<00:01:13.890> the

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
do this and again I'm gonna ignore the

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.039 
do this and again I'm gonna ignore the
question<00:01:14.610> for<00:01:14.760> now<00:01:14.850> I'm<00:01:15.180> just<00:01:15.390> going<00:01:15.840> to<00:01:15.869> look

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
question for now I'm just going to look

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:20.300 
question for now I'm just going to look
at<00:01:16.259> this<00:01:16.439> question<00:01:17.240> so<00:01:18.380> four<00:01:19.380> apples<00:01:19.799> cost

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
at this question so four apples cost

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.390 
at this question so four apples cost
three<00:01:20.880> hundred<00:01:20.939> twenty<00:01:21.360> cents<00:01:21.920> one<00:01:22.920> Apple<00:01:23.310> is

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
three hundred twenty cents one Apple is

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.370 
three hundred twenty cents one Apple is
what<00:01:24.229> how<00:01:25.229> do<00:01:25.290> you<00:01:25.470> figure<00:01:25.680> out<00:01:27.020> the<00:01:28.020> cost<00:01:28.229> of

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
what how do you figure out the cost of

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.819 
what how do you figure out the cost of
each<00:01:28.560> apple<00:01:29.180> you<00:01:30.180> just<00:01:30.450> think<00:01:30.600> that<00:01:30.689> 80<00:01:31.439> cents

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
each apple you just think that 80 cents

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:32.960 
each apple you just think that 80 cents
right<00:01:31.950> you<00:01:32.070> can<00:01:32.220> just<00:01:32.369> do<00:01:32.490> that<00:01:32.520> on<00:01:32.670> top<00:01:32.790> your

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
right you can just do that on top your

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.690 
right you can just do that on top your
head<00:01:33.000> but<00:01:33.420> up<00:01:33.600> to<00:01:34.320> think<00:01:34.650> about<00:01:34.920> the<00:01:35.070> operation

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
head but up to think about the operation

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.749 
head but up to think about the operation
sometimes<00:01:36.450> I<00:01:36.960> know<00:01:37.079> is<00:01:37.439> the<00:01:38.070> example<00:01:38.310> is<00:01:38.520> very

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
sometimes I know is the example is very

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.429 
sometimes I know is the example is very
easy<00:01:38.939> to<00:01:39.060> understand<00:01:39.570> because<00:01:39.720> insects<00:01:40.290> they

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
easy to understand because insects they

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.590 
easy to understand because insects they
realized<00:01:40.799> by<00:01:41.430> really<00:01:41.759> thinking<00:01:41.790> about<00:01:42.030> what

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
realized by really thinking about what

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.380 
realized by really thinking about what
operation<00:01:43.140> did<00:01:43.320> you<00:01:43.439> actually<00:01:43.590> do<00:01:44.210> you<00:01:45.210> get

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
operation did you actually do you get

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.469 
operation did you actually do you get
eighty<00:01:45.630> is<00:01:45.990> because<00:01:46.470> you<00:01:46.680> do<00:01:46.829> 320<00:01:47.670> divided<00:01:48.360> by

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
eighty is because you do 320 divided by

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:53.780 
eighty is because you do 320 divided by
four<00:01:49.070> so<00:01:50.070> one<00:01:50.759> Apple<00:01:51.149> is<00:01:51.329> going<00:01:51.659> to<00:01:51.869> be<00:01:52.579> 320<00:01:53.579> and

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
four so one Apple is going to be 320 and

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.350 
four so one Apple is going to be 320 and
again<00:01:54.689> the<00:01:54.990> division<00:01:55.439> symbol<00:01:55.649> it<00:01:56.210> just<00:01:57.210> cannot

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
again the division symbol it just cannot

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.670 
again the division symbol it just cannot
state<00:01:57.600> by<00:01:57.750> rights<00:01:57.990> with<00:01:58.110> a<00:01:58.170> division<00:01:58.560> symbol

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
state by rights with a division symbol

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.480 
state by rights with a division symbol
will<00:01:59.399> be<00:01:59.490> using<00:01:59.759> fractions<00:02:00.149> okay<00:02:00.930> it's<00:02:01.890> 220

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
will be using fractions okay it's 220

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.859 
will be using fractions okay it's 220
over<00:02:03.270> 4<00:02:03.750> so<00:02:04.259> that's<00:02:04.790> the<00:02:05.790> 80<00:02:06.000> cents<00:02:06.420> that<00:02:06.750> we

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
over 4 so that's the 80 cents that we

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:10.709 
over 4 so that's the 80 cents that we
get

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:10.719 

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:14.289 

and<00:02:11.719> I<00:02:12.079> want<00:02:12.260> to<00:02:12.319> know<00:02:12.530> how<00:02:13.069> much<00:02:13.280> will<00:02:14.000> it<00:02:14.030> be

00:02:14.289 --> 00:02:14.299 
and I want to know how much will it be

00:02:14.299 --> 00:02:18.880 
and I want to know how much will it be
if<00:02:14.599> I<00:02:14.870> won<00:02:15.170> a<00:02:15.379> total<00:02:15.680> of<00:02:15.829> seven<00:02:16.400> apples<00:02:17.890> well

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
if I won a total of seven apples well

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.119 
if I won a total of seven apples well
each<00:02:19.819> Apple<00:02:20.329> is<00:02:20.390> 80<00:02:20.719> cents<00:02:21.170> I<00:02:21.349> just<00:02:21.920> need<00:02:22.040> to

00:02:22.119 --> 00:02:22.129 
each Apple is 80 cents I just need to

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:24.670 
each Apple is 80 cents I just need to
multiply<00:02:22.280> by<00:02:22.609> seven<00:02:23.000> right<00:02:23.180> so<00:02:24.109> to<00:02:24.170> find<00:02:24.500> out

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
multiply by seven right so to find out

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:29.860 
multiply by seven right so to find out
seven<00:02:25.519> apples<00:02:28.060> all<00:02:29.060> I<00:02:29.120> need<00:02:29.390> to<00:02:29.480> do<00:02:29.659> is

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
seven apples all I need to do is

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:36.789 
seven apples all I need to do is
multiply<00:02:30.530> by<00:02:30.950> seven<00:02:31.459> times<00:02:32.090> this<00:02:34.450> 320<00:02:35.799> over

00:02:36.789 --> 00:02:36.799 
multiply by seven times this 320 over

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:39.339 
multiply by seven times this 320 over
boy<00:02:37.040> and<00:02:37.970> that's<00:02:38.120> exactly<00:02:38.269> what<00:02:38.810> we<00:02:38.900> do<00:02:39.019> for

00:02:39.339 --> 00:02:39.349 
boy and that's exactly what we do for

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:43.619 
boy and that's exactly what we do for
seven<00:02:40.340> times<00:02:40.700> eighty<00:02:41.629> which<00:02:42.260> gives<00:02:42.590> you<00:02:42.769> the

00:02:43.619 --> 00:02:43.629 
seven times eighty which gives you the

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:48.119 
seven times eighty which gives you the
560<00:02:44.739> since<00:02:45.739> five<00:02:46.340> dollars<00:02:46.700> and<00:02:46.939> sixty<00:02:47.299> cents

00:02:48.119 --> 00:02:48.129 
560 since five dollars and sixty cents

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:50.770 
560 since five dollars and sixty cents
that's<00:02:49.129> my<00:02:49.370> multiplication<00:02:49.700> I<00:02:50.120> guess<00:02:50.629> that

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
that's my multiplication I guess that

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:51.970 
that's my multiplication I guess that
that<00:02:50.810> right<00:02:51.169> here<00:02:51.349> is<00:02:51.439> for<00:02:51.650> multiplication

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
that right here is for multiplication

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:53.220 
that right here is for multiplication
all<00:02:52.760> right

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
all right

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:55.569 
all right
because<00:02:54.230> later<00:02:54.470> on<00:02:54.560> in<00:02:54.859> algebra<00:02:55.220> you'll<00:02:55.400> use

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:55.579 
because later on in algebra you'll use

00:02:55.579 --> 00:02:58.420 
because later on in algebra you'll use
that<00:02:55.609> access<00:02:56.510> so<00:02:56.919> usually<00:02:57.919> we<00:02:58.010> can<00:02:58.159> just<00:02:58.340> use

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
that access so usually we can just use

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:01.929 
that access so usually we can just use
that<00:02:58.669> for<00:02:58.970> multiplication<00:03:00.340> so<00:03:01.340> not<00:03:01.519> get<00:03:01.790> back

00:03:01.929 --> 00:03:01.939 
that for multiplication so not get back

00:03:01.939 --> 00:03:06.009 
that for multiplication so not get back
to<00:03:02.120> this<00:03:02.299> question<00:03:03.549> the<00:03:04.549> real<00:03:04.790> deal<00:03:05.239> so<00:03:05.659> for

00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:06.019 
to this question the real deal so for

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:10.030 
to this question the real deal so for
ten<00:03:06.349> he<00:03:06.769> says<00:03:06.980> that<00:03:07.189> we<00:03:07.280> have<00:03:07.400> X<00:03:07.669> apples<00:03:08.209> is<00:03:09.040> P

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
ten he says that we have X apples is P

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:16.589 
ten he says that we have X apples is P
cents<00:03:10.370> so<00:03:11.180> let<00:03:11.329> me<00:03:11.389> write<00:03:11.569> this<00:03:11.659> down<00:03:12.909> X<00:03:14.229> apples

00:03:16.589 --> 00:03:16.599 
cents so let me write this down X apples

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:21.899 
cents so let me write this down X apples
cost<00:03:18.489> be<00:03:19.489> cents

00:03:21.899 --> 00:03:21.909 
cost be cents

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:25.479 
cost be cents
so<00:03:22.909> here<00:03:23.569> just<00:03:24.139> by<00:03:24.319> looking<00:03:24.590> at<00:03:24.620> this<00:03:24.769> how<00:03:25.280> much

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:25.489 
so here just by looking at this how much

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:28.030 
so here just by looking at this how much
does<00:03:25.760> each<00:03:25.909> app<00:03:26.180> will<00:03:26.389> cost<00:03:26.680> so<00:03:27.680> as<00:03:27.799> you<00:03:27.919> can

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.040 
does each app will cost so as you can

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.670 
does each app will cost so as you can
kind<00:03:28.250> of<00:03:28.310> see<00:03:28.489> that<00:03:28.790> the<00:03:29.239> X<00:03:29.470> exactly<00:03:30.470> matched

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:30.680 
kind of see that the X exactly matched

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:33.069 
kind of see that the X exactly matched
with<00:03:30.889> the<00:03:31.010> four<00:03:31.280> and<00:03:31.489> the<00:03:31.819> be<00:03:32.060> match<00:03:32.540> with<00:03:32.870> the

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:33.079 
with the four and the be match with the

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:35.770 
with the four and the be match with the
study<00:03:33.349> two<00:03:33.620> so<00:03:34.549> to<00:03:34.609> figure<00:03:34.940> out<00:03:35.150> how<00:03:35.389> much<00:03:35.540> each

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:35.780 
study two so to figure out how much each

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:42.610 
study two so to figure out how much each
Apple<00:03:36.229> cost<00:03:37.209> one<00:03:38.209> Apple<00:03:39.879> will<00:03:40.879> cost<00:03:41.409> you<00:03:42.409> take

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:42.620 
Apple cost one Apple will cost you take

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:46.330 
Apple cost one Apple will cost you take
be<00:03:42.889> the<00:03:43.250> total<00:03:43.609> cost<00:03:44.569> which<00:03:45.169> is<00:03:45.199> be<00:03:45.620> just<00:03:46.220> like

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:46.340 
be the total cost which is be just like

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:51.490 
be the total cost which is be just like
this<00:03:46.519> 220<00:03:47.150> right<00:03:47.269> here<00:03:48.010> divided<00:03:49.010> by<00:03:49.250> X<00:03:50.079> 1<00:03:51.079> Apple

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:51.500 
this 220 right here divided by X 1 Apple

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:59.740 
this 220 right here divided by X 1 Apple
cost<00:03:51.859> B<00:03:52.519> over<00:03:53.169> X<00:03:54.519> B<00:03:55.519> over<00:03:55.819> X<00:03:55.970> cents<00:03:57.819> and<00:03:58.819> a

00:03:59.740 --> 00:03:59.750 
cost B over X B over X cents and a

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:02.349 
cost B over X B over X cents and a
question<00:04:00.290> we<00:04:00.470> want<00:04:00.769> is<00:04:00.979> I<00:04:01.280> want<00:04:02.090> to<00:04:02.299> write

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:02.359 
question we want is I want to write

00:04:02.359 --> 00:04:09.490 
question we want is I want to write
formula<00:04:03.049> if<00:04:03.530> I<00:04:03.769> want<00:04:04.099> total<00:04:04.849> y<00:04:05.629> apples<00:04:06.579> so<00:04:08.500> how

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:09.500 
formula if I want total y apples so how

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:18.990 
formula if I want total y apples so how
much<00:04:09.819> will<00:04:10.819> he<00:04:10.849> be<00:04:12.669> if<00:04:13.669> I<00:04:13.909> want<00:04:15.609> Y<00:04:16.609> apples<00:04:17.180> Y

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:19.000 
much will he be if I want Y apples Y

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.390 
much will he be if I want Y apples Y
again<00:04:20.000> we're<00:04:20.239> just<00:04:20.269> dealing<00:04:20.599> with<00:04:20.870> variables

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400 
again we're just dealing with variables

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.159 
again we're just dealing with variables
it's<00:04:22.550> okay<00:04:22.880> it<00:04:23.030> is<00:04:23.210> it's<00:04:23.720> pretty<00:04:23.870> much<00:04:23.990> the

00:04:24.159 --> 00:04:24.169 
it's okay it is it's pretty much the

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:25.390 
it's okay it is it's pretty much the
same<00:04:24.350> operations<00:04:24.620> that<00:04:24.979> we're<00:04:25.100> doing<00:04:25.250> right

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:25.400 
same operations that we're doing right

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:29.530 
same operations that we're doing right
here<00:04:26.229> once<00:04:27.229> we<00:04:27.410> figure<00:04:27.740> out<00:04:27.770> one<00:04:28.520> Apple<00:04:28.880> is<00:04:29.060> B

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:29.540 
here once we figure out one Apple is B

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:34.810 
here once we figure out one Apple is B
over<00:04:29.720> X<00:04:30.280> so<00:04:31.280> one<00:04:31.490> Apple<00:04:31.820> is<00:04:32.570> like<00:04:33.190> 220<00:04:34.190> over<00:04:34.400> for

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:34.820 
over X so one Apple is like 220 over for

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:37.810 
over X so one Apple is like 220 over for
the<00:04:35.539> one<00:04:35.690> with<00:04:35.930> the<00:04:35.990> earlier<00:04:36.400> to<00:04:37.400> figure<00:04:37.699> out

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:37.820 
the one with the earlier to figure out

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:43.150 
the one with the earlier to figure out
why<00:04:38.030> apples<00:04:38.419> why<00:04:39.380> apples<00:04:41.740> we<00:04:42.740> just<00:04:42.949> need<00:04:43.070> to

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:43.160 
why apples why apples we just need to

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:45.189 
why apples why apples we just need to
multiply<00:04:43.280> by<00:04:43.639> Y<00:04:43.820> right<00:04:44.120> that's<00:04:44.900> just<00:04:44.990> like

00:04:45.189 --> 00:04:45.199 
multiply by Y right that's just like

00:04:45.199 --> 00:04:47.320 
multiply by Y right that's just like
this<00:04:45.350> one<00:04:45.560> right<00:04:45.680> here<00:04:45.850> once<00:04:46.850> you<00:04:47.000> figure<00:04:47.270> out

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:47.330 
this one right here once you figure out

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:49.870 
this one right here once you figure out
the<00:04:47.479> one<00:04:47.690> Apple<00:04:48.080> to<00:04:48.259> figure<00:04:49.100> out<00:04:49.160> seven<00:04:49.550> apples

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:49.880 
the one Apple to figure out seven apples

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:52.629 
the one Apple to figure out seven apples
just<00:04:50.419> multiply<00:04:50.870> by<00:04:51.050> 7<00:04:51.440> 7<00:04:51.889> times<00:04:52.190> 5<00:04:52.370> for<00:04:52.580> this

00:04:52.629 --> 00:04:52.639 
just multiply by 7 7 times 5 for this

00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:56.520 
just multiply by 7 7 times 5 for this
expression<00:04:53.030> is<00:04:54.070> so<00:04:55.070> one<00:04:55.340> Apple<00:04:55.639> is<00:04:55.789> P<00:04:56.030> over<00:04:56.060> X

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:56.530 
expression is so one Apple is P over X

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:00.909 
expression is so one Apple is P over X
let<00:04:57.530> me<00:04:57.560> write<00:04:57.650> it<00:04:57.800> down<00:04:57.889> first<00:04:58.160> I<00:04:59.800> just<00:05:00.800> need

00:05:00.909 --> 00:05:00.919 
let me write it down first I just need

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:03.129 
let me write it down first I just need
to<00:05:01.010> multiply<00:05:01.130> by<00:05:01.550> Y<00:05:01.789> now<00:05:02.479> what<00:05:02.690> give<00:05:02.930> us<00:05:03.080> the

00:05:03.129 --> 00:05:03.139 
to multiply by Y now what give us the

00:05:03.139 --> 00:05:06.460 
to multiply by Y now what give us the
total<00:05:03.470> cost<00:05:03.949> so<00:05:04.340> put<00:05:05.120> a<00:05:05.180> Y<00:05:05.419> right<00:05:06.020> next<00:05:06.320> to<00:05:06.410> it

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:06.470 
total cost so put a Y right next to it

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:08.439 
total cost so put a Y right next to it
that<00:05:07.400> indicates<00:05:07.550> down<00:05:08.090> if<00:05:08.270> they're

00:05:08.439 --> 00:05:08.449 
that indicates down if they're

00:05:08.449 --> 00:05:09.129 
that indicates down if they're
multiplying

00:05:09.129 --> 00:05:09.139 
multiplying

00:05:09.139 --> 00:05:12.969 
multiplying
then<00:05:10.070> that's<00:05:10.280> pretty<00:05:10.610> much<00:05:10.729> it<00:05:11.419> okay<00:05:11.960> y<00:05:12.530> times

00:05:12.969 --> 00:05:12.979 
then that's pretty much it okay y times

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:17.560 
then that's pretty much it okay y times
B<00:05:13.430> over<00:05:13.460> X<00:05:14.000> will<00:05:14.720> be<00:05:14.870> the<00:05:14.900> cost<00:05:15.229> of<00:05:15.560> y<00:05:16.520> apples<00:05:16.940> so

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:17.570 
B over X will be the cost of y apples so

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:23.370 
B over X will be the cost of y apples so
the<00:05:18.410> answer<00:05:18.710> to<00:05:18.740> this<00:05:19.039> is<00:05:19.750> y<00:05:20.750> times<00:05:21.440> B<00:05:21.830> over<00:05:22.099> X

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:23.380 
the answer to this is y times B over X

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:25.719 
the answer to this is y times B over X
but<00:05:24.380> let<00:05:24.500> me<00:05:24.560> take<00:05:24.710> a<00:05:24.740> look<00:05:24.949> of<00:05:25.190> the<00:05:25.370> question

00:05:25.719 --> 00:05:25.729 
but let me take a look of the question

00:05:25.729 --> 00:05:33.550 
but let me take a look of the question
of<00:05:26.270> the<00:05:26.599> answer<00:05:27.169> choices<00:05:29.470> so<00:05:30.470> I<00:05:31.510> have<00:05:32.510> B<00:05:32.900> over<00:05:33.320> X

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:33.560 
of the answer choices so I have B over X

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:40.240 
of the answer choices so I have B over X
Y<00:05:34.210> x<00:05:35.210> over<00:05:35.570> B<00:05:35.720> Y<00:05:35.949> XY<00:05:36.949> over<00:05:37.490> B<00:05:37.659> P<00:05:38.659> Y<00:05:38.900> of<00:05:39.110> X<00:05:39.289> BX<00:05:40.070> over

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:40.250 
Y x over B Y XY over B P Y of X BX over

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:43.420 
Y x over B Y XY over B P Y of X BX over
Y<00:05:40.599> ok<00:05:41.599> so<00:05:42.020> it<00:05:42.320> looks<00:05:42.380> kind<00:05:42.889> of<00:05:42.919> different<00:05:43.070> than

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:43.430 
Y ok so it looks kind of different than

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:46.330 
Y ok so it looks kind of different than
what<00:05:43.550> we<00:05:43.669> have<00:05:43.880> right<00:05:43.909> here<00:05:44.710> where<00:05:45.710> you<00:05:45.770> have<00:05:45.889> Y

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:46.340 
what we have right here where you have Y

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:49.980 
what we have right here where you have Y
times<00:05:46.970> B<00:05:47.389> over<00:05:47.659> X<00:05:47.810> we<00:05:48.500> can<00:05:48.650> put<00:05:48.830> a<00:05:48.860> Y<00:05:49.099> on<00:05:49.370> the<00:05:49.610> top

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:49.990 
times B over X we can put a Y on the top

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:53.469 
times B over X we can put a Y on the top
so<00:05:50.990> that's<00:05:51.169> a<00:05:51.260> see<00:05:51.380> okay<00:05:51.830> so<00:05:52.310> you<00:05:52.940> can<00:05:53.090> put<00:05:53.210> Y<00:05:53.449> on

00:05:53.469 --> 00:05:53.479 
so that's a see okay so you can put Y on

00:05:53.479 --> 00:05:58.930 
so that's a see okay so you can put Y on
the<00:05:53.720> top<00:05:53.870> so<00:05:54.470> Y<00:05:54.680> P<00:05:55.150> over<00:05:56.150> X<00:05:57.340> so<00:05:58.340> maybe<00:05:58.550> that<00:05:58.820> will

00:05:58.930 --> 00:05:58.940 
the top so Y P over X so maybe that will

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:03.610 
the top so Y P over X so maybe that will
be<00:05:59.000> the<00:05:59.120> answer<00:05:59.449> let<00:06:00.409> me<00:06:00.560> see<00:06:00.770> I<00:06:02.409> need<00:06:03.409> to<00:06:03.500> look

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:03.620 
be the answer let me see I need to look

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:06.430 
be the answer let me see I need to look
for<00:06:03.680> B<00:06:04.070> YY<00:06:04.310> b<00:06:04.550> and<00:06:05.030> if<00:06:05.659> you<00:06:05.810> take<00:06:05.960> a<00:06:05.990> look<00:06:06.139> of<00:06:06.320> the

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:06.440 
for B YY b and if you take a look of the

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:09.670 
for B YY b and if you take a look of the
answer<00:06:06.680> choice<00:06:06.919> D<00:06:08.139> and<00:06:09.139> you<00:06:09.260> just<00:06:09.470> show<00:06:09.620> you

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:09.680 
answer choice D and you just show you

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:13.450 
answer choice D and you just show you
like<00:06:09.889> this<00:06:11.289> so<00:06:12.289> the<00:06:12.409> answers<00:06:12.680> that<00:06:12.710> guy<00:06:13.130> is<00:06:13.190> YB

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:13.460 
like this so the answers that guy is YB

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:17.439 
like this so the answers that guy is YB
and<00:06:13.909> notice<00:06:14.870> in<00:06:15.680> choice<00:06:15.949> B<00:06:16.190> in<00:06:16.789> choice<00:06:17.060> D<00:06:17.270> we

00:06:17.439 --> 00:06:17.449 
and notice in choice B in choice D we

00:06:17.449 --> 00:06:20.589 
and notice in choice B in choice D we
have<00:06:17.570> B<00:06:17.870> Y<00:06:18.080> over<00:06:18.500> X<00:06:18.740> and<00:06:19.070> you<00:06:19.970> can<00:06:20.150> switch<00:06:20.360> the

00:06:20.589 --> 00:06:20.599 
have B Y over X and you can switch the

00:06:20.599 --> 00:06:22.689 
have B Y over X and you can switch the
order<00:06:20.780> of<00:06:20.900> opera<00:06:21.260> you<00:06:22.130> can<00:06:22.250> switch<00:06:22.490> the<00:06:22.669> order

00:06:22.689 --> 00:06:22.699 
order of opera you can switch the order

00:06:22.699 --> 00:06:26.230 
order of opera you can switch the order
of<00:06:23.180> multiplication<00:06:24.250> so<00:06:25.250> I<00:06:25.550> think<00:06:25.669> the<00:06:25.940> answer

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:26.240 
of multiplication so I think the answer

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:31.839 
of multiplication so I think the answer
there<00:06:26.270> one<00:06:26.599> must<00:06:26.780> to<00:06:26.990> be<00:06:27.490> Y<00:06:28.490> over<00:06:29.449> X<00:06:30.580> they<00:06:31.580> wants

00:06:31.839 --> 00:06:31.849 
there one must to be Y over X they wants

00:06:31.849 --> 00:06:35.860 
there one must to be Y over X they wants
to<00:06:31.940> do<00:06:32.570> it<00:06:32.690> this<00:06:32.930> it's<00:06:33.770> okay<00:06:34.130> just<00:06:34.610> switch<00:06:35.090> the

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:35.870 
to do it this it's okay just switch the

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:40.320 
to do it this it's okay just switch the
be<00:06:36.340> that's<00:06:37.340> how<00:06:37.460> we<00:06:37.520> get<00:06:37.790> answer<00:06:38.720> choice<00:06:38.960> D

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:40.330 
be that's how we get answer choice D

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:41.530 
be that's how we get answer choice D
okay

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:41.540 
okay

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:45.100 
okay
and<00:06:42.410> so<00:06:42.590> choice<00:06:42.800> D
