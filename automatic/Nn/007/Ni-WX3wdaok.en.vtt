00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:11.309
 I arrive at the export 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:17.760
 very short addendum to the video of 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:19.980
 yesterday's video yesterday was day b24 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.900
 People are a little bit surprised 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.430
 Repeat style is low which can 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.140
 I'm not so high the intensity 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.779
 I would like to make a few points 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.720
 First of all you have to say absolutely 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.520
 stop the man every training day 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.079
 Above all, in a plan in which one makes 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.000
 in which one very often in training 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.350
 is very very many specifications one has 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.500
 absolutely must stop every day 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.570
 to see individually every day you make 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.460
 actually needs the other of the 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.700
 set intensity no it works 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.469
 long term for the combination of 1 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.930
 of course, the combination of the 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:54.449
 intensity and, of course, the 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.879
 hopefully the combination and combination 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:01:00.270
 of growth location yes we have 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.140
 Here are 60 repetitions just for 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.619
 the legs 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:08.850
 but you have to do it now you always have to 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:13.409
 Superior did b2 then comes to fruition 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:16.409
 if he thinks something dark I carry b2 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:18.479
 then comes to wear if c1 so if 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:21.990
 that's what we mean 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:25.320
 actually want the two on day b2 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.340
 already who give some active rest of 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.710
 the intensity fro a bit 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.619
 turn off 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:35.040
 that was point 2 point 3 us 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:39.900
 have 60 repetitions here and if 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:42.840
 we now remember 60 the 60 and we 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:46.320
 look at us b1 with 40 and another 40 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:48.990
 at 80 we are at 140 and 140 respectively 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:52.590
 still two times more per week than 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:54.479
 120 more per week than of course the 120 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.250
 but we have observed that in what 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.790
 they keep that up and so on 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.640
 and so on 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:03.360
 so do not see each day individually 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.860
 but see the whole package and the 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:08.030
 last point I want to say 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.030
 also with 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:15.380
 also with these 60 repetitions too 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:17.900
 with the wine press also with the 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:20.930
 beginner with the viticulture if I can 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.800
 i run the exercises cleanly 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:24.470
 up out 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:28.190
 a delight and a training with 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:30.980
 60 repetitions accomplish that me 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:33.710
 let the stairs go down as if 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:35.600
 I would travel on raw eggs that 

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:37.820
 on the topic of intensity I can also with 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:40.220
 60 repetitions my legs totally 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:43.610
 So all in all, as I said 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:46.910
 not every single day but see 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:48.830
 just see the whole thing and how 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:51.910
 said if you high the intensity 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:55.940
 screw volt reduces the weight 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:57.590
 less less should already be slower 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:59.959
 repetition numbers or repetitions 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:02.390
 execution and certainly increases the 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:04.489
 intensity increases in the just in the 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:06.500
 negative component is always the 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:08.600
 growth buried and that's just what 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:11.320
 for example, with the two isolations 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:14.870
 Exercises, of course, a lot better 

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:17.239
 given and a lot better feasible 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:19.360
 as now with exercises with big ones 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:23.510
 weight and you will see 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:25.370
 as soon as we are at day c2 will be c2 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:26.540
 as well from the recovery pay 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:28.100
 perhaps a bit lower 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:29.510
 but also from the intensity because if 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:31.760
 I pull out 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:33.980
 what is the most intense exercise then is 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:36.049
 Well, the replacement exercise not so 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:40.670
 intense but you will see that 

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:41.630
 then b1 b2 and b2 c1 just fine 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:43.820
 alternate 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:45.920
 because this repetition but this this 

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:49.370
 regeneration you need then too 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:51.290
 if you give him b1 and c1 intense 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:55.480
 trained until next time we are 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:55.480
 makes us at c2 again
