00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.250
 let's see below the exact way to perform sea trials 

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:11.509
 almerÃ­a form remembered 

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:13.729
 to make a ballad disc 

00:00:13.729 --> 00:00:16.599
 dexter lillian we need of course 

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:18.779
 a bunch of knob stick 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:19.989
 a cape 

00:00:19.989 --> 00:00:21.999
 or what is the same a mango 

00:00:21.999 --> 00:00:23.420
 these peoples that 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:27.120
 that we use for the realization of xcode vara wasting 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.510
 we recycle it from my son's broom 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.590
 when my son's things came to an end his lifespan 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.530
 us instead of throwing them of course 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.019
 place to send them to ashura 

00:00:40.019 --> 00:00:41.630
 we recycle it 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:44.530
 and with those sticks we make broomsticks 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:47.430
 for several rivers boy and pickers 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.660
 annealed wire 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:51.590
 and of course 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:54.460
 ccoo terpins ace to carry out the sea 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:58.130
 the procedure is to clean the perlis rod since many times you can 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:00.350
 get to buy in xochimilco 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:05.110
 science goes out the mooring a very strong mooring with the wire annealed to the 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:06.900
 bunch of rod 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.900
 a wire sewn that measures up to about two meters 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.390
 the ballad of 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:16.390
 det er league 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.280
 and later celeste puts the mango 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.510
 from my son's broom 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:26.570
 in which it is already previously tipped 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:29.840
 so he can be put in because otherwise he can not get in 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.330
 he gets the stick praises of perry and 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:36.020
 and it's not good to be a rustic sweep 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.330
 The procedure is very simple 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:41.460
 since we not only give more than about five minutes to 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:42.979
 make a rod broom 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:46.430
 a perfectly broom that does not work 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:47.619
 for the sweep 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:48.400
 i 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.730
 we cover ourselves 

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:53.470
 that was in a lot of square meters 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:55.200
 linear meters in the other neighborhood
