00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:11.490
 Let's see how to seal the seal first. 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:15.080
 The way to close the seams is to open your fingers 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.080
 Poem of the little finger 

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:21.260
 Hang it and wind it only 1 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:23.150
 And turn it over. 

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:26.439
 like this 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:26.439
 It's like this . 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:41.000
 This is just noise in'll try again 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:44.750
 Spread your palms before passing during the actual standing of the little finger wound back 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:50.299
 Hang on the index finger and hold the needle. 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:53.860
 This is the way to catch the c in the continental routing . 

00:00:50.299 --> 00:01:00.880
 Now , let 's do a bitch. 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:01:07.520
 You know, the shit is here you see before you. 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:14.420
 I stuck a needle on the thread in front of him 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:17.420
 The way to do it is to put a choco in front of you at night, 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:22.780
 First, wrap your finger in this way 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:29.560
 Starting from the next pull will then twist 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:35.430
 Poke in front of you and remove it from your back by just walking out. 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:39.710
 I stabbed the front thread 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.710
 Remove it again 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:48.020
 Poke the word in front of you and walk behind the thread to pull this nose out 

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:59.530
 Before stabbing walk keeping 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:02:04.060
 Stabbing 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:07.950
 Poke and walk. 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.950
 You can do this over and over again. 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:18.830
 This is how it works . At first, the thread may not be sucked. 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.830
 You can practice. 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:22.500
 Slowly again 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:26.579
 Put c in front 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:35.690
 Pull out the poetry in front of you 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.690
 Stabbing 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:44.810
 Except poked walk 

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:44.810
 It's over.
