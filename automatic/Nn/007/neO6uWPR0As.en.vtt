00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:02.730
 now he saw something I throw at you 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:25.750
 Yup 

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:28.180
 excuse me for a moment bribes let's try 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:29.890
 think of them not foolish to risk 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:33.400
 compromising our beautiful friendship 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:36.220
 for a bare three- legged groove 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:40.030
 from plucked to you and it wouldn't be either 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:43.570
 a morsel for one of us is all bone 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:46.600
 and feathers and mian from the sick patient 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:48.580
 sorry I would say ton to put it back 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.620
 in the beach and leave him alone e 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:53.710
 let us put them in peace, let us leave them in the ides 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:56.530
 this is not even the carry over there much 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:59.500
 we are not interested in this 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:01.930
 moment and sylvan disturbance me 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:05.340
 takes and I would not want you to slip you are 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:08.710
 you may not want to break your leg 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:12.250
 and if the neck bone breaks 

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:14.620
 we risk together you know I tell you 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:18.390
 you have an exceptional common sense silvestri 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:18.390
 and above all the noble ways 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:31.520
 well this is already done as well 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:36.349
 really made then take care of me tom 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:36.349
 some all old sylvan health 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:43.280
 damn Neapolitans who measures for 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.099
 Hey 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:03:03.160
 but look at what figure I had to do 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:06.489
 certain from appearances I realize 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:08.620
 that everything is against me I know but I was 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:10.480
 let's say so worried you understand me 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:13.000
 that poor little animal could have 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:16.420
 fear and all alone up there at the top of 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.590
 he explains and then I thought about going there to 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:21.880
 do some company 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:23.380
 if you pass it you will certainly not think that you are not 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:25.330
 he wanted to give her back his owed 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:27.549
 have critters and lets that be 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:36.940
 It was a disgrace for me and my family 

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:39.390
 similar but I trust the honor 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:39.390
 and cats 

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:49.660
 I'd start looking 

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:05.640
 red 

00:05:37.659 --> 00:05:44.389
 note your criminal project 

00:05:40.909 --> 00:05:46.550
 bloody did not work was not 

00:05:44.389 --> 00:05:49.479
 no criminal blood project 

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:53.089
 and has a greeting to a friend 

00:05:49.479 --> 00:06:06.139
 I really want to see who you go to greet 

00:05:53.089 --> 00:06:08.089
 now you would have never imagined that 

00:06:06.139 --> 00:06:10.809
 the life of a canal was like this 

00:06:08.089 --> 00:06:10.809
 adventurous
