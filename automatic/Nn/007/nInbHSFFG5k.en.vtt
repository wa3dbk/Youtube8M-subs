we're going to have a quick look at a
couple<00:00:09.389> of<00:00:09.540> the<00:00:09.660> modifications<00:00:10.349> I've<00:00:10.559> made<00:00:10.769> to

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
couple of the modifications I've made to

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.980 
couple of the modifications I've made to
my<00:00:10.920> rx-8<00:00:14.059> inside<00:00:15.059> the<00:00:15.210> boot<00:00:15.389> you'll<00:00:15.540> see<00:00:15.750> in<00:00:15.870> a

system<00:01:47.340> from<00:01:48.149> here<00:01:48.299> I<00:01:48.329> can<00:01:48.509> see<00:01:48.689> how<00:01:48.869> fast<00:01:49.079> the

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
system from here I can see how fast the

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.200 
system from here I can see how fast the
engine<00:01:49.619> is<00:01:49.799> revving<00:01:50.159> the<00:01:50.820> battery<00:01:51.180> voltage

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
engine is revving the battery voltage
