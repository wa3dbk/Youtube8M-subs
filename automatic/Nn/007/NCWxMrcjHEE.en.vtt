00:00:00.619 --> 00:00:03.619
 that has rtv is made possible in part by van cz 

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:07.400
 and her sister 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.249
 in this episode of hart liver tv 

00:00:19.249 --> 00:00:22.249
 however, you can safely see this according to 

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:33.780
 welcome to I had a bit of the new external hard drives set 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.460
 becker plus palestines according to the police for sure 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.399
 yes and great he is sure too 

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:45.620
 brand in size and also not informed and with about 300 grams and this has a 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:50.019
 capacity of four telecommuting and that is for the at least 15 types of reports 

00:00:50.019 --> 00:00:51.030
 ball hard drives 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.269
 isn't that really a lot stronger then it is actually de facto 

00:00:55.269 --> 00:00:59.170
 impossible pentling trick because there are no second half inspire2live 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:00.370
 to get 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:04.480
 the students they want count the must here nobody knows it is that two and 

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:08.870
 indeed in its four riches with one another compiled on the n4 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:13.600
 therapist for a volume yes i have a whole story contrast anatolia what 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.440
 it for another share of retailers 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:16.719
 advantage he the ball 

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:20.520
 that it is nice and fast after seeing so many people come back but stress of 230 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:21.909
 megabit per second 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:25.560
 and those for the volume of those two and two writers also added together 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.299
 and conflict with the storage capacity the edese becomes bratwurst 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.439
 what you can grab to pass just not in my pocket for my passion 

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:34.800
 will be your breast pocket 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:38.860
 and whoever combines these sure dollar debts in a raid 0 relationship two 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:43.000
 disks but so as one of them leaves life with you already 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.130
 lost your data but she did position it obvious when you become backup 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.609
 The intention is that you make backups here 

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:53.310
 from bale paddy on your computer the whole Christmas dinners were allowed to be things where I 

00:01:53.309 --> 00:01:54.780
 want to take along euros 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.810
 now the technical problem is that we also state on your pc there yes i have to 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.900
 I honestly say that I actually do not like that story very strongly 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:04.720
 I find the more interesting storage device on me and things great 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:08.180
 files may carry again some more videos like that rich 

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:11.660
 People who post cardio also never have super fast storage capacity 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.980
 also interesting if your bones leads to nothing in it not so very much 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.950
 storage on board yes yes yes and david taylor when easy to carry 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:23.020
 yes yes and yes if you want to come along as backup software her pelarazzo 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:26.570
 use siket also supplies very good backup software but medal 

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:29.710
 have that option but it is indeed so at the moment that one of 

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:30.870
 the writers died 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:32.269
 then you have in this case 

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:34.769
 let it be clear that feyenoord 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:38.569
 a small and lightweight it is very much the advantage of tolkien 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:41.290
 Counterparty external hard drives do of course sometimes exist 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:44.259
 generally, of course, three and a half times from the reactor 

00:02:44.259 --> 00:02:48.650
 a lot heavier so that study take just a little less easy 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:53.140
 plus that external three and a half in chennai the drive always do the plug 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:57.760
 you also had to do it this time from your laptop yes there is this collective agreement there 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:01.309
 with its annual membership for having the writing press 

00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:03.340
 the two fingers on strikes 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.510
 this is clearly the unibet walked by connecting and biting it 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:09.930
 to provide some extra booth jaap painter it is a bit on which 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:10.810
 computer you have 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:14.380
 if you need a cable for the text, say years in most cases 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:18.389
 so can simply use portable so a train or heating 

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:22.239
 and if I had sixty days the time and body I thought what it actually is 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:26.069
 no newspaper the cable between the set but something better idea the writer is 

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:29.170
 we have had to be a little longer every year for a very short time 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:33.660
 and just the cable between say the two usb and aux connection so at the 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:35.649
 clinic to be with you is very long 

00:03:35.649 --> 00:03:39.579
 and exactly why it is so but actually this is very smart year me 

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:42.619
 I saw it right away, but he has seven of them himself that year in essen and 

00:03:42.619 --> 00:03:45.909
 They were filthy on a large scale for youth and had a side 

00:03:45.909 --> 00:03:48.220
 You can't do better than on the other hand you have 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:51.800
 maybe even more usb connection and then you can go to the cell one year 

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:52.779
 sides 

00:03:52.779 --> 00:03:55.679
 go backwards what there is still a small thing about the land you imagine 

00:03:55.679 --> 00:03:57.169
 after a desktop computer 

00:03:57.169 --> 00:04:02.219
 Is this really the short cable yes, because then you will have years 

00:04:02.219 --> 00:04:05.649
 appear somewhat along the side of your work bundle and pack that 

00:04:05.649 --> 00:04:08.289
 china now buzzing place tastiest feeling with and 

00:04:08.289 --> 00:04:11.569
 in her writing, e-mail to base empowered and a number of closures 

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:14.829
 sit so high that the facing yes then you have to start thinking about the 

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:17.930
 Drive on the expansion with most men are then still a little later 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:21.489
 but yes that is affected then just to call and to call in the pegi cassano 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:22.029
 clear up 

00:04:22.029 --> 00:04:25.270
 but that did not happen but was not the most amazing situation 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:29.310
 Another benefit of negligence is that it also naturally emerges that late 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:33.350
 Be clear it's really a product the laptop users have the debate about 

00:04:33.909 --> 00:04:37.389
 in terms of performance, on the hope that I was no longer parked there working 

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:38.439
 we nice and fast 

00:04:38.439 --> 00:04:41.999
 trying to study the files back and forth as the fifth set machine of it 

00:04:41.999 --> 00:04:45.139
 small town to do it a bit slower but just for backup them 

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:48.479
 wanting to eat it is again almost just to cover up a disc 

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:53.069
 and it is best for you to back up a match day at a time 

00:04:53.069 --> 00:04:56.879
 The price remains small Switzerland the 230 euros that is no longer gone 

00:04:56.879 --> 00:05:00.080
 buy if you do look a bit again at what one 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:05.139
 a terabyte the external disk choir then you talk about 50 60 euros extra what 

00:05:05.139 --> 00:05:08.870
 you pay for this yes and that was not helped quite early what was there and 

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:10.289
 was offering this 

00:05:10.289 --> 00:05:13.300
 And with that comes the end of this episode of Actua TV 

00:05:14.009 --> 00:05:18.430
 i don't know what they want man broke wednesday friday we watch 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:20.639
 the reverse 

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:22.249
 for the audience that you do that 

00:05:22.249 --> 00:05:25.569
 from the left environment so not from that also in the traffic in the area 

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:29.860
 and therefore we actually have the viruses that cause that 

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:32.210
 antivirus programs work new on 

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:36.009
 or can hide well in itself he has no chance of the 

00:05:36.009 --> 00:05:38.749
 earthquake when playing along differently 

00:05:38.749 --> 00:05:40.309
 pasting google maps says more
