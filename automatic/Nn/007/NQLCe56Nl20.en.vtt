and now we're going to cut out the top
and<00:00:06.750> there's<00:00:07.750> two<00:00:08.230> ways<00:00:08.380> you<00:00:08.440> can<00:00:08.710> do<00:00:08.860> this<00:00:09.030> if

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:10.030 
and there's two ways you can do this if

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:13.259

the<00:00:13.450> plans<00:00:13.750> together<00:00:14.050> and<00:00:14.559> I<00:00:15.280> make<00:00:15.550> this

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:15.760 
the plans together and I make this

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:20.309 
the plans together and I make this
template<00:00:17.999> just<00:00:18.999> drawn<00:00:19.300> out<00:00:19.539> everything
