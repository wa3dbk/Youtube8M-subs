00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.380
 from the situation the first option is to buy 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.009
 iphone 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:16.710
 pump slender muscles but there is another 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:19.560
 third way hummer h2 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:23.430

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:26.670
 just huge it is brutal as i don't know 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:29.400
 how grieved to understand and this machine is not for 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.470
 simple it is only for tough guys not 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.239
 we will be about the appearance we all saw it 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.570
 on the streets of your city you know 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:39.600
 some faceted crocodile 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:41.340
 but do you understand when you go before 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.620
 only mother knew you were small 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.960
 pussy then they will now know everything and 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.969
 everyone who looks at you when you drive 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.800
 On this monsters will understand that you 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.079
 We bought it only to 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.809
 show off in front of chicks just to 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:57.360
 show yourself and everyone will know that to me 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:02.149
 really really not at all 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.149
 so cool as look at the salon 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:13.920
 do you understand me some chest 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:17.310
 and I will explain why the fact is that he 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:20.400
 looks like a thrust bearing do not feel like 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:25.170
 bud luxurious it is made on its 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:28.549
 money for this plastic we just he 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:32.130
 some very cheap hotels 

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:34.079
 the upholstery creaks somehow felt here 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:37.320
 what's missing him a little Japanese 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:39.390
 quality or German chic but the point is 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.939
 the fact that he should not be the idea 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.130
 shikdos somewhere a descendant of the military 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:45.540
 car and it was used first 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.780
 all in combat 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:50.280
 Here is their creation of this car attached 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:54.030
 arm himself arnold schwarzenegger 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:57.479
 he is very big to his fans but 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:59.610
 for all of my not carnias but this car 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:02.430
 does not feel like a car 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.979
 executive class you know she 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:07.320
 it will be brutal from the outside she is so all 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:08.729
 yourself cool but up you sit in not 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.430
 do you understand that this is just 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:14.400
 any such good big guy 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:16.859
 which are just a hybrid 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:20.939
 school bus and some 

00:02:16.859 --> 00:02:23.549
 family minivan when you sit behind 

00:02:20.939 --> 00:02:26.060
 driving does not have the feeling that it is 

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:28.680
 cool is what's for cool guys 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:31.200
 you feel comfortable but at the same time 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:33.269
 time all these big sweeping 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.769
 buttons I'll catch what they did it 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:36.180
 specifically so that they can 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:39.239
 wear gloves 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:41.480
 but at the same time there is no feeling 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:44.400
 some kind of comfort someone chic 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:46.379
 some driving pleasure driving 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.810
 look at this huge 

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:52.019
 gear lever he's just 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:54.689
 massive to some kind of aircraft here i'm 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:58.129
 I understand that they wanted to achieve this they 

00:02:54.689 --> 00:03:01.590
 They wanted to make it clear that this is a car for 

00:02:58.129 --> 00:03:03.269
 powerful big people who have 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:06.709
 big swing in life 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:09.209
 drive this 3 ton car and 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:11.000
 sweeping away everything in its path of Jesus 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:14.879
 track to your goal 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:17.819
 more about the engine here is not 

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:21.470
 too modern old gluttonous 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:26.790
 but pretty powerful in a 6-liter v8 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:27.750
 With a capacity of 326 days, in theory, we should 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:30.720
 just be 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:33.720
 incredible power under the hood that 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:36.750
 not even measure but the problem is understand and in 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:39.930
 that the car weighs about 3 tons and 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:42.379
 these three tons of weight combined with this 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:44.879
 stupid absolutely 

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:49.379
 old to four speed automatic 

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:51.060
 they kill all traction every drive and in 

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:54.010
 our result 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:55.500
 cool w cool this is what turns here 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:58.450
 family healthy 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:01.000
 which impresses with one 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:04.090
 angle on a friend and slowly riding over bumps 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:07.209
 and I don't feel any in him 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:10.239
 sportiness absolutely understand for these 

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:12.909
 money is a choice you can take 

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:16.479
 mx5 cannon and maybe even 6 

00:04:12.909 --> 00:04:18.669
 some old but those machines 

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:21.759
 it is felt that the Germans laid in them 

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:26.530
 attitude to sport on the drive to the power and 

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:29.740
 here here what you are left with is this 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:31.810
 they see the wheels of the city throw 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:32.380
 scornful looks at those who ride 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:34.810
 Zhiguli 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:36.820
 Well, the network task he copes 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:40.030
 look great as spectacular 

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:43.570
 opens the hood we need to push back 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:44.440
 these latches here they were freed by that 

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:48.729
 parties too 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:57.990
 and well not for girls machines kivot powerful 

00:04:48.729 --> 00:05:00.550
 effort and just we just monster 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:01.060
 then not all like this more more 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:04.870
 a machine 

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:06.699
 because there is music tasharu there is something 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:09.460
 such that you can not drink to the savanna 

00:05:06.699 --> 00:05:12.610
 when you are not feeling you 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:16.990
 you understand why so many fans to and 

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:19.320
 why people love so many and this 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:22.990
 here is a feeling of power 

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:24.490
 brutal feeling full 

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:26.210
 security and confidence 

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:30.350
 present all sorts 

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:33.259
 it is often pommelya but the largest 

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:34.270
 lack of a car is still an expense 

00:05:33.259 --> 00:05:38.120
 singing 

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:40.430
 modern world consumption of 25 liters 

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:43.009
 city and this trip as a girl and 

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:46.310
 if you begin to actively maneuver 

00:05:43.009 --> 00:05:48.860
 accelerate quickly at some expense 

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:52.430
 will be at least 40 liters 

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:56.060
 out enough even if secured 

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:58.430
 man but consumption of 40 liters is 

00:05:56.060 --> 00:06:01.260
 I just do not see the point in the end 

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:02.569
 already would say that 

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:05.509
 by the way and 

00:06:02.569 --> 00:06:07.580
 start i was set up somehow critical but 

00:06:05.509 --> 00:06:11.540
 Now at the end of our test drive, I 

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:13.449
 feel like it liked it 

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:15.999
 here it hooked the top 

00:06:13.449 --> 00:06:16.560
 I'm coming home now I feel that 

00:06:15.999 --> 00:06:18.320
 to me 

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:20.630
 learn to part with it 

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:23.270
 I just want to keep going and go 

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:26.950
 until it ends very 

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:29.000
 quickly that he lived in 40 meters but 

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:32.120
 know and 

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.460
 I think there are people who 

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:35.590
 to which 

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:38.080
 still the mole where there are still such 

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:38.990
 romantic who look at consumption 

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:41.330
 fuel 

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:45.880
 first and foremost cars and 

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:45.880
 of this, I certainly and naturally 

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:52.440
 By the way, you can feel it . 

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:52.440
 you sit behind the wheel 

00:06:55.460 --> 00:07:00.550
 there is some 

00:06:56.870 --> 00:07:00.550
 kite history kind 

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:04.190
 on yourself you are jamming in vain 

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:08.930
 higher in this car 

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:15.390
 I studied all the same 

00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:17.460
 greedy but soulful big 

00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:20.509
 that's all thanks
