00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:12.330
 Hello, now I will tell you how 

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:13.110
 overclock the nvidia video card with 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:18.420
 applets 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:22.369
 and nvidia system tools is official 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.369
 let's run the program for now 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:32.560
 This is the official program of the company. 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:32.560
 nvidia 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.390
 it can be downloaded from the official site 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:44.510
 This is a big plus I think so 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:50.310
 plus is that it will be sparing 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.310
 treat your video card 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:01:02.590
 plus the interface she has Rus 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:02.590
 Russified 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.640
 and as far as possible safe 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:18.780
 so set 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:31.860
 what else do I want to say about this program 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:35.170
 after watching the video you can 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:38.380
 download directly by my reference 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:45.780
 I will leave a link where you can 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:45.780
 download this program I still left there 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:54.910
 list 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:57.090
 recommended video card for this 

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:57.090
 programs 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:06.909
 here 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:13.250
 if you need to overclock ati video card 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:19.170
 look for my other video for safe 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:25.630
 overclocking ati video cards 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:28.140
 but in this case we accelerate 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:28.140
 nvidia 

00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:42.049
 still there is a system monitor utility with 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.049
 by which you can 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:52.570
 Well, follow the processor load 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:53.610
 video cards but this is already 

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:59.520
 will figure it out 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:59.520
 run our overclocking program 

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:07.440
 the first run may be a little bit 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:07.440
 long 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:16.239
 but let's wait for it to start here 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:19.519
 this window has opened and there is 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:22.719
 performance further take 

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:26.390
 license agreement 

00:03:22.719 --> 00:03:29.290
 here nvidia corporation shoots itself 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:35.450
 responsibility for wrong 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:41.709
 use this program click 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:41.709
 accept device setting agreement 

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:50.870
 here is our default frequency of my 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:54.639
 video card 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:57.829
 Yes, and the default settings 

00:03:54.639 --> 00:04:02.930
 put a tick custom 

00:03:57.829 --> 00:04:07.150
 settings and I advise you to find find 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:08.629
 optimal settings the program itself 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:11.919
 will test 

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:11.919
 your card 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:17.810
 make this the optimal frequency setting 

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:26.270
 if this is not enough for you, you can 

00:04:22.879 --> 00:04:30.110
 manually adjust you see me 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:36.949
 was there 533 what's there now 608 here 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:41.050
 increased sliders here we press 

00:04:36.949 --> 00:04:44.930
 apply all now our frequency 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:50.990
 set optimally you 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:54.289
 can increase as 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:56.689
 let's say they increased the game 

00:04:54.289 --> 00:04:59.650
 tried it as you can 

00:04:56.689 --> 00:05:05.919
 increase the frequency but slightly 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:05.919
 Well, in principle, everything can be further closed 

00:05:06.789 --> 00:05:11.710
 load saved parameters click 

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:11.710
 Yes 

00:05:13.009 --> 00:05:17.060
 everything 

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:17.060
 I wish you success
