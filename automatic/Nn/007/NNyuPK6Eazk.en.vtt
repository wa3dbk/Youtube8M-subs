00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:28.400
 or wool otaku beds and one piece fans 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.440
 in this video we will continue with the second 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.210
 part of the curiosities in which 

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:34.670
 I will talk about things that called me the 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:37.970
 attention and theorize about them I hope 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:40.610
 Enjoy it let's start 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:42.440
 in the first curiosity we can see 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:44.420
 clover that can be appreciated very well 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:46.490
 that it carries chains of callus sec and 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:48.680
 broken on the feet which brings us to 

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:51.050
 think he was chained in prison 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:53.240
 now to theorize is about this I think that 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:55.100
 he was imprisoned for a short 

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:57.140
 time or it could be flamingo what 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.850
 will chained somewhere for having broken 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:02.600
 the blood code or have it 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:05.239
 disobeyed or for some other reason 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:07.759
 second curiosity we all wonder 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:09.860
 why use does not leave your toy and use a 

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:11.960
 gun or rifle as you can beat 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:14.299
 strong enemies that will obviously come 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.190
 soon as it is the case of they will see if 

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:18.500
 will face this sniper not 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:20.509
 I would come out victorious well here comes my 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.640
 good theory I think now he wanted 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:24.860
 implement a new style for those who 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.990
 they are snipers with weapons he wanted 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:29.210
 choose something simple and turn it into 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:31.220
 something that is very interesting which 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:32.810
 he did also in the fox case that in 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:35.300
 instead of using two swords he wanted 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:37.460
 implement a totally unique style and 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:39.740
 amazing the style of three swords 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.929
 so I do not think now, though 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.880
 I see it impossible after creating a 

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:45.860
 style for the character and suddenly 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.569
 change it completely what I think is 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:51.190
 that now will surprise us with something 

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:53.500
 great that will put us in doubt at all 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:55.150
 third and last curiosity in this 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:57.910
 final which caught my attention 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:59.860
 in which you can see using dress 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:01.900
 I am Ekin Havana woman from the band 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:03.820
 lyon with black beard which at 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:05.860
 seem to have a fight in which 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:08.530
 He seems to have beaten use vain woman 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:10.180
 now theorize about stefan ar first 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:12.520
 I do not think that at the combat level in the 

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:14.740
 which is currently used I do not think that 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:16.900
 can beat banier but if it were a 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:19.120
 skill combat like the one he performed 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:21.340
 against danny masterson this one had more 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.870
 chances of winning but in the fanar 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:25.270
 you can see that they are going to woman has been 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:27.700
 crossed by two arrows and in very bad 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:29.440
 possibly death state leave me your 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:31.360
 theories down here about who 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.690
 I would win a battle between these two 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:36.240
 snipers 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:38.700
