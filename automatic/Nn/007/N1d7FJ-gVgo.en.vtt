I did record this video twice already
but<00:00:18.690> the<00:00:18.810> first<00:00:19.109> time<00:00:19.289> the<00:00:19.380> audio<00:00:19.710> messed<00:00:19.920> up

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100

so this is my 83 construction level
let's<00:01:07.350> go<00:01:07.590> ad<00:01:07.950> through<00:01:08.310> construction<00:01:08.700> all

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
let's go ad through construction all

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.210 
let's go ad through construction all
levels<00:01:09.510> over<00:01:09.930> 83<00:01:10.409> that<00:01:10.710> is<00:01:10.799> what<00:01:10.920> we<00:01:11.040> like<00:01:11.189> to

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
levels over 83 that is what we like to

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.399 
levels over 83 that is what we like to
see<00:01:11.400> I<00:01:11.760> don't<00:01:12.540> like<00:01:12.630> I<00:01:12.750> struck<00:01:13.049> from<00:01:13.170> a<00:01:13.229> tool

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.539 
see I don't like I struck from a tool
which<00:01:13.680> is<00:01:13.710> why<00:01:14.010> it's<00:01:14.189> my<00:01:14.310> worst<00:01:14.549> skill<00:01:15.450> but

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:16.549 
which is why it's my worst skill but

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:18.380 
which is why it's my worst skill but
hopefully<00:01:17.549> with<00:01:17.700> these<00:01:17.820> videos<00:01:18.150> it<00:01:18.360> will

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
hopefully with these videos it will

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.510 
hopefully with these videos it will
motivate<00:01:18.600> me<00:01:19.020> to<00:01:19.049> do<00:01:19.259> it<00:01:19.350> more<00:01:19.500> and<00:01:19.650> hopefully

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
motivate me to do it more and hopefully

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.190 
motivate me to do it more and hopefully
it<00:01:20.670> will<00:01:20.729> motivate<00:01:20.880> some<00:01:21.240> of<00:01:21.330> you<00:01:21.420> guys<00:01:21.540> to<00:01:21.869> max

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
from last night from the red sandstone

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.630 
from last night from the red sandstone
because<00:02:10.560> i<00:02:10.679> was<00:02:10.770> about<00:02:10.920> to<00:02:11.069> get<00:02:11.190> the<00:02:11.280> level<00:02:11.520> and

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
because i was about to get the level and

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.100 
because i was about to get the level and
then<00:02:11.760> looked<00:02:12.120> at<00:02:12.209> was<00:02:12.390> oh<00:02:12.480> crap

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
then looked at was oh crap

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.650 
then looked at was oh crap
so<00:02:13.410> I'm<00:02:13.620> about<00:02:13.920> to<00:02:14.130> get<00:02:14.220> 96<00:02:14.700> crafting<00:02:15.390> which<00:02:15.540> is

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
so I'm about to get 96 crafting which is

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.300 
so I'm about to get 96 crafting which is
a<00:02:15.690> really<00:02:15.990> nice<00:02:16.170> level<00:02:16.440> because<00:02:16.740> it's<00:02:17.070> getting

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
a really nice level because it's getting

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.810 
a really nice level because it's getting
closer<00:02:17.730> to<00:02:17.910> that<00:02:18.030> 99<00:02:18.570> and<00:02:19.230> that<00:02:19.470> is<00:02:19.680> a<00:02:19.730> one<00:02:20.730> of

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:20.820 
closer to that 99 and that is a one of

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:23.690 
closer to that 99 and that is a one of
the<00:02:20.880> goals<00:02:21.090> we<00:02:21.360> want<00:02:21.600> 99<00:02:22.110> crafting<00:02:22.620> so<00:02:23.190> I<00:02:23.520> just

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
the goals we want 99 crafting so I just

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.020 
the goals we want 99 crafting so I just
got<00:02:23.820> 96<00:02:24.680> not<00:02:25.680> sure<00:02:25.860> why<00:02:26.040> i<00:02:26.280> unlock<00:02:26.700> I<00:02:26.880> think

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
got 96 not sure why i unlock I think

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.030 
got 96 not sure why i unlock I think
it's<00:02:27.150> something<00:02:27.630> dungeoneering<00:02:28.350> but<00:02:28.530> nothing

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
it's something dungeoneering but nothing

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.260 
it's something dungeoneering but nothing
too<00:02:29.310> useful<00:02:30.020> but<00:02:31.020> 99<00:02:31.410> crafting<00:02:32.370> will<00:02:32.640> be<00:02:32.880> one

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270

the wrong place in the first place but I

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.470 
the wrong place in the first place but I

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
am getting a room coffin level and I've

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:19.940 
am getting a room coffin level and I've
been<00:03:18.720> doing<00:03:18.959> that<00:03:19.049> a<00:03:19.110> lot<00:03:19.260> recently<00:03:19.500> since

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950

it's<00:03:20.190> really<00:03:20.549> a<00:03:20.580> FK<00:03:20.940> so<00:03:21.000> you<00:03:21.299> can<00:03:21.420> do<00:03:21.630> it<00:03:21.720> while

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
it's really a FK so you can do it while

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.900 
it's really a FK so you can do it while
you<00:03:21.959> study<00:03:22.170> and<00:03:22.350> it's<00:03:22.620> great<00:03:23.100> and<00:03:23.580> it's<00:03:23.700> still

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
you study and it's great and it's still

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
a decent XP per hour rate so if I didn't

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:27.949 
a decent XP per hour rate so if I didn't
put<00:03:26.430> that<00:03:26.459> in<00:03:26.640> the<00:03:26.730> game<00:03:26.880> I<00:03:27.030> had<00:03:27.120> no<00:03:27.450> idea<00:03:27.480> how

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959 
put that in the game I had no idea how

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:29.750 
put that in the game I had no idea how
I'll<00:03:28.110> be<00:03:28.140> able<00:03:28.290> to<00:03:28.440> do<00:03:28.560> it<00:03:28.680> just<00:03:29.310> cuz<00:03:29.519> room

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
I'll be able to do it just cuz room

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.640 
I'll be able to do it just cuz room
graphing<00:03:30.120> easily<00:03:30.630> even<00:03:31.140> worse<00:03:31.410> in

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650

construction<00:03:32.160> and<00:03:32.310> that<00:03:33.030> is<00:03:33.150> not<00:03:33.360> good<00:03:34.070> so

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:35.070 
construction and that is not good so

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:36.560 
construction and that is not good so

do<00:04:37.060> like<00:04:37.300> the<00:04:37.360> HD<00:04:37.870> when<00:04:38.140> recording<00:04:38.410> so<00:04:39.220> we<00:04:39.310> get

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:39.430 
do like the HD when recording so we get

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:41.550 
do like the HD when recording so we get

break<00:05:10.570> from<00:05:10.630> RS<00:05:11.230> when<00:05:11.440> it<00:05:11.530> came<00:05:11.680> out<00:05:11.770> so<00:05:11.830> i

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:12.070 
break from RS when it came out so i

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:13.680

didn't<00:05:12.670> really<00:05:12.760> do<00:05:12.940> it<00:05:12.970> and<00:05:13.210> I've<00:05:13.300> just<00:05:13.330> never

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:13.690 
didn't really do it and I've just never

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:17.650 
but i guess i should do that i probably

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:19.860 
but i guess i should do that i probably
make<00:05:17.860> a<00:05:17.890> video<00:05:18.130> on<00:05:18.280> it<00:05:18.400> if<00:05:18.490> i<00:05:18.580> do<00:05:18.640> and<00:05:18.970> sort
