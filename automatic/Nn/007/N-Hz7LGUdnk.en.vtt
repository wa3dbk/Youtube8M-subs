00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:16.940
 and well hello everyone 

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:18.590
 as you can see below at 

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:20.029
 left john marston is sorry is 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:22.939
 now available in the editor of 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:27.080
 characters online so I tried to 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:29.570
 make the video just now how 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:33.440
 have john marston as a father in 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:35.090
 gta online the problem is that on my 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:37.160
 pro on my main account I had 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:37.850
 already too many people so I could not 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.190
 create a new 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.900
 the second problem is that it is that 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.630
 on this character is not connected to the 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:46.520
 rockstar social club to study i 

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:49.520
 had to redo everything re-register on 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:50.719
 social club star and it's finally short on 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:53.540
 so now I'm finally going 

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:55.910
 to be able to show you how to see john 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:58.160
 marston a doctor no I was online 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:59.719
 so we meet for those who know 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:03.050
 not how to youth the social club 

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:05.710
 so if I remember well you're going 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:05.710
 in 

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:18.280
 so that's when you're not connected 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:20.320
 at social the other star social club you 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:22.930
 go to gallery he offers you to 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:24.520
 connect and create a context and 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:26.830
 so that's where I can not see them 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:29.710
 that I like doing it so we end up 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:33.040
 in the long teeth change them from 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:34.510
 character here then I assure you that 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.700
 this video is great utility for the 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:38.700
 most gta players 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.170
 because they will have already created their own 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.120
 short 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:48.670
 so we choose a new one new 

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:50.170
 tab not in herenites and so lo 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:51.910
 so for those who do not know 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:54.030
 I was haye who go either they go 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:56.080
 see her at Christmas or a title like that 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.370
 when you create your character you 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:00.130
 can change the choose the big ones 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:02.800
 parents so there for example chosen my 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:04.360
 grandparents and will see john 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:05.830
 marston then for those who do not know 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:08.290
 who is john marston this is the 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:12.310
 main character of the hero of red 

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:16.410
 dead redemption so here we go 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:18.880
 find here and there I see we had 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:22.300
 capitalized the ability to silence 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:24.480
 special okay so I knew 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.480
 the 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:32.400
 okay the cheapest is not a big 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:36.090
 shot by falling on it by aldar the other 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:37.680
 day I arrived in the menu here 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:40.019
 I create my character is walking 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.459
 many times on carey like that and 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:42.319
 for a moment he gave me john 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:44.459
 marston 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:46.560
 so that's for those who did not know 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:47.939
 I hope it helped you so after 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.120
 you can choose to be a man or 

00:02:47.939 --> 00:02:50.120
 a woman 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:55.010
 when you can always change your 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.250
 grandparents so that's rather not 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.319
 wrong 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.810
 so it 'll do we'll try to do 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:03.140
 a little young marcel for that he we 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:09.620

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:12.530
 face shit it's caribbean and 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:14.300
 mother villages very dominant the father has 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:14.690
 badly acted but resemblance to the bottom for the 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:18.050
 to lose 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:20.060
 it must not be a problem so here we go 

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:22.370
