here<00:02:30.040> now<00:02:30.610> as<00:02:30.760> you<00:02:30.880> slow<00:02:31.120> down<00:02:31.980> the<00:02:32.980> belt<00:02:33.880> will

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
here now as you slow down the belt will

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:39.150 
here now as you slow down the belt will

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
low speed what can happen there is if

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:45.170 
low speed what can happen there is if
you<00:02:42.580> get<00:02:42.730> oil<00:02:42.970> on<00:02:43.180> a<00:02:43.209> belt<00:02:43.709> which<00:02:44.709> can<00:02:44.890> happen

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
you get oil on a belt which can happen

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.500 
you get oil on a belt which can happen
it<00:02:46.180> just<00:02:46.420> can<00:02:46.720> happen<00:02:47.050> from<00:02:47.170> a<00:02:47.260> bad<00:02:47.440> oil<00:02:47.770> seal

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
it just can happen from a bad oil seal

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:52.500 
it just can happen from a bad oil seal
and<00:02:49.510> you'll<00:02:49.660> have<00:02:49.810> problems<00:02:50.970> your<00:02:51.970> variator

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
and you'll have problems your variator

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:55.320 
and you'll have problems your variator

the<00:02:57.130> very<00:02:57.340> earth<00:02:57.550> ator<00:02:57.940> weights<00:02:58.360> or<00:02:58.780> well<00:02:58.959> I

00:02:58.979 --> 00:02:58.989 
the very earth ator weights or well I

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:00.330 
the very earth ator weights or well I
kind<00:02:59.350> of<00:02:59.410> I<00:02:59.590> don't<00:02:59.680> know<00:02:59.769> they're<00:03:00.010> not<00:03:00.160> that

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
kind of I don't know they're not that

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:04.440 
kind of I don't know they're not that
small<00:03:02.010> and<00:03:03.010> they<00:03:03.340> can<00:03:03.489> get<00:03:03.610> squared<00:03:03.940> off<00:03:04.150> and

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.450 
small and they can get squared off and

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:06.600 
small and they can get squared off and
then<00:03:04.600> you<00:03:05.019> need<00:03:05.200> different<00:03:05.980> ones<00:03:06.310> and<00:03:06.489> then

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:06.610 
then you need different ones and then

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:08.250 
then you need different ones and then
they<00:03:06.760> also<00:03:07.060> come<00:03:07.390> in<00:03:07.480> different<00:03:07.630> gram<00:03:07.989> weights

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 
they also come in different gram weights

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.449 
they also come in different gram weights
which<00:03:08.530> is<00:03:08.650> a<00:03:08.680> whole<00:03:08.920> different<00:03:09.340> video<00:03:09.730> series

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
which is a whole different video series

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:18.270 
which is a whole different video series
but<00:03:12.459> if<00:03:12.640> you<00:03:12.820> were<00:03:14.700> weights<00:03:16.620> square<00:03:17.620> off<00:03:17.829> and

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 
but if you were weights square off and

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:21.120 
but if you were weights square off and
you<00:03:18.970> have<00:03:19.120> get<00:03:19.360> any<00:03:19.570> kind<00:03:19.780> of<00:03:19.870> oil<00:03:20.049> in<00:03:20.350> into<00:03:20.920> in

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:21.130 
you have get any kind of oil in into in

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:23.550 
you have get any kind of oil in into in
this<00:03:21.400> on<00:03:21.730> the<00:03:21.940> belts<00:03:22.239> then<00:03:22.959> you<00:03:23.200> need<00:03:23.350> to<00:03:23.440> take

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:23.560 
this on the belts then you need to take

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.160 
this on the belts then you need to take
apart<00:03:23.860> to<00:03:24.040> really<00:03:24.220> clean<00:03:24.459> it<00:03:24.900> another<00:03:25.900> problem

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:26.170 
apart to really clean it another problem

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:28.199 
apart to really clean it another problem
is<00:03:26.440> back<00:03:26.920> here<00:03:27.130> on<00:03:27.250> the<00:03:27.340> clutch<00:03:27.519> which<00:03:27.850> people

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:28.209 
is back here on the clutch which people

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:30.270 
is back here on the clutch which people
don't<00:03:28.450> understand<00:03:29.110> this<00:03:29.560> is<00:03:29.739> a<00:03:29.769> clutch<00:03:30.010> belt

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:30.280 
don't understand this is a clutch belt

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.759 
don't understand this is a clutch belt
right<00:03:30.370> in<00:03:30.519> here<00:03:31.079> alright<00:03:32.079> once<00:03:32.380> you<00:03:32.500> take<00:03:32.650> this
