00:00:00.619 --> 00:00:03.619
 welcome to the serious Friuli 

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:07.370
 Prof from Optics is actually an airplane 

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:10.370
 I start with the engine 

00:00:13.239 --> 00:00:16.239
 if I now push the thrust regulator forward 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:21.289
 Bob starts moving 

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:26.349
 this also follows with the strings or Peter Ahrens 

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:32.579
 But needs some exercise initially 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:37.220
 note the step Koppold Schick 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.640
 you can move freely in the scenery 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.640
 Hon 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:03.540
 and discovered too many interesting details 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.170
 behind 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:20.830
 as background noise are also from 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.750
 Barbara opens up completely new perspectives 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.750
 For example, you can track the tallit traffic 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:41.400
 This is not least interesting for creating screenshots and videos 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:51.840
 Bremen 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.840
 Son 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.130
 The sport can also be fast 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.260
 to check the big distance 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.260
 are up to 85 knots 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:10.180
 However, this also requires a long braking distance 

00:02:22.109 --> 00:02:26.849
 In the end, just 9 MB download from Prof only crawls to you 

00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:31.749
 Download link and all other information in the CVP preview of more 

00:02:31.749 --> 00:02:32.589
 website 

00:02:32.589 --> 00:02:34.269
 here the link 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:35.399
 thanks to the ship
