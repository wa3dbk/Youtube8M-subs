alright the back at all set looks good

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:39.530 
alright the back at all set looks good
and<00:05:36.630> we<00:05:36.900> go<00:05:37.050> to<00:05:37.110> the<00:05:37.440> front<00:05:37.940> subframe<00:05:38.940> bolt<00:05:39.420> is

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:39.540 
and we go to the front subframe bolt is

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:42.140 
and we go to the front subframe bolt is
tight<00:05:39.780> now<00:05:40.110> it's<00:05:40.740> time<00:05:40.890> to<00:05:40.920> mark<00:05:41.250> the<00:05:41.430> sides<00:05:41.760> of

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:42.150 
tight now it's time to mark the sides of

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:44.300 
tight now it's time to mark the sides of
the<00:05:42.300> subframe<00:05:42.750> connector<00:05:43.230> where<00:05:43.860> we<00:05:44.100> will

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:44.310 
the subframe connector where we will

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:47.150 
the subframe connector where we will
then<00:05:44.460> drill<00:05:44.940> out<00:05:44.970> the<00:05:45.330> subframe<00:05:45.960> so<00:05:46.950> that<00:05:47.100> we

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:47.160 
then drill out the subframe so that we

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:48.980 
then drill out the subframe so that we
can<00:05:47.280> bolt<00:05:47.460> in<00:05:47.670> the<00:05:47.790> front<00:05:48.060> our<00:05:48.540> subframe

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:48.990 
can bolt in the front our subframe

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:52.190 
can bolt in the front our subframe
connectors<00:05:49.530> are<00:05:49.710> bolt<00:05:49.980> in<00:05:50.190> so<00:05:50.870> you<00:05:51.870> can<00:05:52.020> always
