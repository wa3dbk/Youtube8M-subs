know everything came together again and

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:40.120 
know everything came together again and
it's<00:02:37.790> one<00:02:37.940> of<00:02:38.000> those<00:02:38.090> games<00:02:38.330> that<00:02:38.980> should<00:02:39.980> be

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:40.130 
it's one of those games that should be

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:41.949 
it's one of those games that should be

one of the highlights of what's happened
at<00:02:42.020> Iowa<00:02:42.260> State<00:02:42.290> but<00:02:42.709> a<00:02:42.890> team<00:02:43.519> that<00:02:43.550> was<00:02:43.730> very
