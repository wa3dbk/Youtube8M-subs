00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.549
 how in this competition all this 

00:00:12.299 --> 00:00:16.349
 that young people want to show 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:19.080
 desire to do circus today 

00:00:16.349 --> 00:00:20.939
 and tomorrow that is to say that both 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.680
 we can go back to numbers 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.140
 more traditional but which is 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.230
 re-appropriates and transforms into 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.779
 make a number 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:31.000
 or sometimes even mix disciplines 

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:33.100
 to create new numbers or even 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.870
 went so far as to create new accredited 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:37.720
 for aerial numbers 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:39.220
 so that's what it really is 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:40.780
 the future of the circus playing in 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:43.239
 World Circus Festival of Tomorrow and 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:45.730
 it's also a lot of their career because 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:47.800
 that the whole world of circus comes to 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:51.330
 bets to attend the festival and 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.330
 discover all these new trends 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:23.360
 yeah we like to do stuff 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:25.550
 on the stage so the knife after the 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:28.030
 whip could so we like the style of 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:32.100
 wise and here we take it that 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:32.100
 between numbers actually it's a bit tied 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.500
 for me it was really a dream and I 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:49.260
 did not believe that one day I'm doing my 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.720
 number here because we started late 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:53.550
 with circus and we were not too 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.280
 well at the bronze level 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:58.320
 so now yes it's yes I 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.040
 do not understand it's the mayor who 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.040
 becomes break 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:19.480
 a show that 32 is what we can 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.970
 to do in the streets did not 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.880
 necessarily 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:26.470
 no more blows 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:28.950
 how do we know in a 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:31.120
 new final tram I do not think so 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.569
 different from the different music of the 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.810
 rest 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:37.069
 idea that makes me so I think it's 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:38.960
 well because there is both this mixture 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:43.020
 almost a year 

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:45.200
 who lost a little in his esteem to 300 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:45.200
 m 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.120
 g 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:06.900
 so it's really now in the 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:09.209
 whole world of young people are devoting their 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:11.250
 life their youth because it's he 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:11.940
 must start early to create numbers 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:16.010
 circus 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:18.560
 it is in this also that his features 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:20.299
 very reassuring for the future of the circus 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.950
 to see all these young people in the world 

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:24.860
 seeking to create news 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:26.780
 things to do with this circus craft 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:28.849
 because it's still a job where 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:31.069
 it takes a lot of humility must 

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:32.599
 enormously worked these are young people 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:35.150
 who know that one would never be rich 

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:37.190
 who will never be famous because 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:39.650
 it is a profession of humility and that the 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:41.329
 number will make 4 the 5 minutes we will 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:43.370
 see we're going to make them a huge shouting 

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:43.909
 but their name will fade also made 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:45.890
 quickly 

00:03:43.909 --> 00:03:49.480
 so it's young people who devote 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:49.480
 their life to give pleasure to others
