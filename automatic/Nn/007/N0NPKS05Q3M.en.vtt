00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
 the twin city motor of 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.420
 motorcycles has existed for more than one 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.189
 century at the heart of this conception itself 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.330
 find two cylinders that form v 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.790
 around the crankshaft 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.650
 this configuration is more compact than 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.429
 the engines right she continues to 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.429
 to seduce the amateurs 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:25.040
 this twin v engine can you 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:26.480
 train in ballads and exciting 

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:28.930
 and make the dust bite 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.930
 sedans 

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:34.390
 to make one of his engines a 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:37.480
 robot places a cylinder in a machine 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:38.800
 equipped with tco tools 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.510
 these tools strawberries the slats 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.890
 of the cylinder are the 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:43.090
 cooling fins which 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:46.260
 will dissipate the heat 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:46.260
 produced by the engine 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:51.649
 this little cup at ease the center of the 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.449
 cylinder in order to rectify to 

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:54.920
 precise dimensions so that 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:58.010
 engine components can be there 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.989
 perfectly integrated 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:03.800
 an operator then assembles the 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:06.879
 crankshaft he aligns the connecting rods and the 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.879
 slide on the bearings 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.930
 then assemble the connecting rods and bearings 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.930
 on the crankshaft 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.890
 a machine has just everything with clamping 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.410
 a lift raises now 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.210
 the crankshaft assembly and the 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:30.110
 transfer to the lower part of 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.110
 engine kart'are 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:40.310
 at the next post a distributor 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:42.470
 Automated apply salt-year 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:44.860
 precision on the inner contour of the 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:44.860
 cartel 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.439
 the editors then adjusts the part 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:51.360
 upper case on the part 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:53.869
 lower and gives you both 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.869
 together 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:00.910
 it's time to connect the crankcase and 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.330
 the crankshaft assembly at the 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:03.330
 transmission 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:09.350
 this lid runs but and the touch 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.350
 final 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.329
 the camshaft is now installed 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:20.890
 in the cart this piece will settle 

00:02:17.329 --> 00:02:20.890
 the opening and closing of the valves 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.220
 the pistons are put in place on the 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.520
 old who is already in the 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.520
 box 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:36.489
 the factory cylinders is a little earlier 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:39.510
 are placed on the pistons for 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:39.510
 cover the cylinder heads 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:47.120
 the technicians the paints then the 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.120
 factories to adjust them to ass asthma 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:58.319
 a robot debunks by just squeezing it 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.420
 that need 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:03.349
 an editor then installs the pipes that 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:03.349
 will welcome the pushers 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:11.510
 he puts them in place in the cylinder heads 

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:15.950
 then add metal lids 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:19.600
 to keep them in place he inserts 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:19.600
 now the pushers in the pipes 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.629
 here is the injection system 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:26.319
 which controls the flow of 

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:26.319
 fuel in the engine 

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:30.790
 it is installed between the two cylinders 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:38.810
 a special bracket keeps the system 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:38.810
 Injection in place 

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:46.160
 the worker bolen the lids of 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:49.420
 rain cylinder head adds chrome discovery 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:49.420
 to embellish the assembly 

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:57.940
 the editor now screws the filter to 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:00.810
 oil engine kart'are and deer 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:02.370
 using a special key 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:05.660
 here is the electric charge system 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:05.660
 who goes on the crankshaft 

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:12.600
 it's time for pumps and oil 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:14.960
 in this twin v engine and the 

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.960
 adjust 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:21.250
 computerized death equipment takes 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:21.250
 place and it cuts the engine 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:27.750
 the engine runs and the technician goes 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:29.640
 all speeds 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:31.050
 this process allows the test equipment 

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:33.410
 to analyze every aspect of his 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:33.410
 yield 

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:44.080
 the workers uncertain candles 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.080
 ignition in classes 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:52.130
 these are these gleaming 2584 cc engines are 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:52.130
 ready to take the road of assault
