for in some of the potential schools
what's<00:02:19.630> the<00:02:19.750> biggest<00:02:20.050> going<00:02:20.260> to<00:02:20.319> be<00:02:20.380> the

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470 
what's the biggest going to be the

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:22.350 
what's the biggest going to be the
biggest<00:02:20.680> factor<00:02:21.130> in<00:02:21.280> government<00:02:21.670> I<00:02:21.970> think<00:02:22.300> the

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
biggest factor in government I think the

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.300 
biggest factor in government I think the
biggest<00:02:22.480> fact<00:02:22.840> there<00:02:23.050> is<00:02:23.170> a<00:02:23.200> high<00:02:23.980> cost<00:02:24.220> of

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
biggest fact there is a high cost of

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:25.949 
biggest fact there is a high cost of
iron<00:02:24.550> with<00:02:24.640> a<00:02:24.670> coach<00:02:24.940> and<00:02:25.150> a<00:02:25.209> style<00:02:25.450> of<00:02:25.540> play<00:02:25.750> I

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:25.959 
iron with a coach and a style of play I

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:28.020 
iron with a coach and a style of play I
think<00:02:26.319> those<00:02:26.470> two<00:02:26.500> are<00:02:26.709> the<00:02:26.950> biggest<00:02:27.489> factors

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
think those two are the biggest factors

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:29.820 
think those two are the biggest factors
for<00:02:28.150> not<00:02:28.600> just<00:02:28.750> me<00:02:28.900> but<00:02:28.930> anybody<00:02:29.260> and<00:02:29.709> you

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
style of play and I think those two
