00:00:38.229 --> 00:00:38.239 
can't go into a circle anymore to close

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:41.469 
can't go into a circle anymore to close
it<00:00:38.420> off<00:00:38.620> we<00:00:39.620> it's<00:00:39.860> also<00:00:40.100> a<00:00:40.309> closure<00:00:41.180> piece

00:00:51.549 --> 00:00:51.559 
piece but before I do use a piece I want

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:53.350 
piece but before I do use a piece I want
to<00:00:51.619> just<00:00:51.739> keep<00:00:51.949> on<00:00:52.100> going<00:00:52.460> into<00:00:52.790> a<00:00:52.820> circular

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:53.360 
to just keep on going into a circular

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.570 
to just keep on going into a circular
motion<00:00:53.570> you<00:00:53.930> see<00:00:54.110> that<00:00:54.290> just<00:00:55.040> keep<00:00:55.190> on<00:00:55.339> going

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:55.580 
motion you see that just keep on going

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:58.630 
motion you see that just keep on going
into<00:00:55.760> a<00:00:55.940> circle<00:00:56.449> and<00:00:56.769> then<00:00:57.769> I<00:00:57.799> want<00:00:58.100> to<00:00:58.190> use<00:00:58.369> my

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:14.510 
keep on doing is just going up and so

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:16.270 
keep on doing is just going up and so
like<00:01:14.750> I<00:01:14.960> first<00:01:15.470> you<00:01:15.590> want<00:01:15.800> it<00:01:15.890> to<00:01:16.040> like<00:01:16.250> a

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:16.280 
like I first you want it to like a

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.850 
like I first you want it to like a
u-shape<00:01:17.120> and<00:01:17.360> then<00:01:17.840> once<00:01:18.050> you<00:01:18.170> get<00:01:18.260> closer<00:01:18.560> to

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:18.860 
u-shape and then once you get closer to

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:20.890 
u-shape and then once you get closer to
the<00:01:19.040> top<00:01:19.310> we<00:01:19.520> want<00:01:19.700> it<00:01:19.820> to<00:01:19.970> like<00:01:20.150> a<00:01:20.180> circle<00:01:20.780> and

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:20.900 
the top we want it to like a circle and

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:22.240 
the top we want it to like a circle and
a<00:01:20.960> complete<00:01:21.350> circle<00:01:21.770> you're<00:01:21.920> gonna<00:01:22.010> keep

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:22.250 
a complete circle you're gonna keep

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:24.310 
a complete circle you're gonna keep
closing<00:01:22.580> it<00:01:22.820> up<00:01:22.910> and<00:01:23.120> so<00:01:23.240> you<00:01:23.300> can't<00:01:23.600> close<00:01:24.110> it

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:24.320 
closing it up and so you can't close it

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.950 
closing it up and so you can't close it
off<00:01:24.440> anymore<00:01:24.950> and<00:01:25.190> once<00:01:25.670> I<00:01:25.850> cut<00:01:26.120> the<00:01:26.270> hair<00:01:26.450> and

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:26.960 
off anymore and once I cut the hair and

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.290 
off anymore and once I cut the hair and
style<00:01:27.590> it<00:01:27.860> I<00:01:28.010> will<00:01:28.310> come<00:01:28.490> back<00:01:28.610> at<00:01:28.760> you<00:01:28.790> guys<00:01:29.000> to

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.130 
ahh okay you guys you see that little

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:36.550 
ahh okay you guys you see that little
hoe<00:01:34.760> again<00:01:35.540> what<00:01:35.720> imma<00:01:35.900> do<00:01:36.020> is<00:01:36.110> we're<00:01:36.230> gonna<00:01:36.320> go

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:36.560 
hoe again what imma do is we're gonna go

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.340 
hoe again what imma do is we're gonna go
in<00:01:36.740> a<00:01:36.890> circular<00:01:37.220> motion<00:01:37.700> to<00:01:38.540> fill<00:01:38.750> it<00:01:38.870> in<00:01:38.990> a

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:39.350 
in a circular motion to fill it in a

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:40.899 
in a circular motion to fill it in a
bitch<00:01:39.800> didn't<00:01:40.100> want<00:01:40.220> to<00:01:40.310> stop<00:01:40.520> because<00:01:40.820> I'm

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:40.909 
bitch didn't want to stop because I'm

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:42.880 
bitch didn't want to stop because I'm
going<00:01:41.060> to<00:01:41.150> use<00:01:41.270> the<00:01:41.390> closure<00:01:41.600> piece<00:01:42.020> but<00:01:42.680> you

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:42.890 
going to use the closure piece but you

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:44.680 
going to use the closure piece but you
just<00:01:43.070> keep<00:01:43.280> on<00:01:43.430> filling<00:01:43.730> it<00:01:43.909> in<00:01:44.030> just<00:01:44.390> turn<00:01:44.570> it

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:44.690 
just keep on filling it in just turn it

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:46.719 
just keep on filling it in just turn it
into<00:01:44.900> a<00:01:45.050> circle<00:01:45.530> a<00:01:45.560> little<00:01:45.800> bitty<00:01:45.950> circle<00:01:46.430> just

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:46.729 
into a circle a little bitty circle just

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:49.840 
into a circle a little bitty circle just
filling<00:01:47.060> it<00:01:47.180> in<00:01:47.300> like<00:01:47.600> so<00:01:48.370> the<00:01:49.370> closure<00:01:49.640> is

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:49.850 
filling it in like so the closure is

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:51.700 
filling it in like so the closure is
pretty<00:01:50.090> easy<00:01:50.360> it<00:01:50.600> seem<00:01:50.840> difficult<00:01:51.200> but<00:01:51.560> it's

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:51.710 
pretty easy it seem difficult but it's

00:01:51.710 --> 00:02:03.990 
pretty easy it seem difficult but it's
not

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:04.000 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:12.490 

on<00:02:05.000> the<00:02:05.119> track<00:02:05.390> I<00:02:11.020> remember<00:02:12.020> what<00:02:12.140> I<00:02:12.200> said<00:02:12.260> you

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
on the track I remember what I said you

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:13.780 
on the track I remember what I said you
guys<00:02:12.620> you<00:02:12.770> don't<00:02:12.950> have<00:02:13.070> to<00:02:13.250> use<00:02:13.400> that<00:02:13.610> much

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
guys you don't have to use that much

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:15.940 
guys you don't have to use that much
glue<00:02:14.209> especially<00:02:15.140> when<00:02:15.260> you<00:02:15.320> get<00:02:15.440> to<00:02:15.500> the<00:02:15.740> top

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
glue especially when you get to the top

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:17.440 
glue especially when you get to the top
cuz<00:02:16.190> you<00:02:16.340> don't<00:02:16.430> want<00:02:16.640> to<00:02:16.700> write<00:02:16.820> glue<00:02:17.120> Shawn's

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
cuz you don't want to write glue Shawn's

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:24.100 
cuz you don't want to write glue Shawn's
on<00:02:21.310> say<00:02:22.310> just<00:02:22.880> put<00:02:23.060> it<00:02:23.239> make<00:02:23.690> it<00:02:23.810> go<00:02:23.900> on<00:02:24.020> the

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
on say just put it make it go on the

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:30.070 
on say just put it make it go on the
circuit<00:02:24.590> and<00:02:27.940> then<00:02:28.940> what<00:02:29.360> again<00:02:29.780> what<00:02:29.959> I'm

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 
circuit and then what again what I'm

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.470 
circuit and then what again what I'm

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
pea size which it is P right here I'm

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:37.660 
pea size which it is P right here I'm
gonna<00:02:36.080> use<00:02:36.320> the<00:02:36.470> closure<00:02:36.680> piece<00:02:37.010> all<00:02:37.430> you<00:02:37.550> do

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670

might do is find a little section in

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:12.630 
might do is find a little section in
here<00:05:11.320> that<00:05:11.620> needs<00:05:11.830> a<00:05:11.950> little<00:05:12.130> hair<00:05:12.370> and<00:05:12.400> I
