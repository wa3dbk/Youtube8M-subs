00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
Marfa 3 either my point being is that I

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.520 
Marfa 3 either my point being is that I
actually<00:01:16.970> go<00:01:17.970> i<00:01:18.270> do<00:01:18.660> pretty<00:01:18.900> well<00:01:19.020> this<00:01:19.290> game

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
actually go i do pretty well this game

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.440 
actually go i do pretty well this game
and<00:01:19.800> i<00:01:20.010> think<00:01:20.220> i<00:01:20.250> get<00:01:20.370> like<00:01:20.460> a<00:01:20.520> 27<00:01:21.060> chill<00:01:21.210> streak

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
and i think i get like a 27 chill streak

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.530 
and i think i get like a 27 chill streak
however<00:01:22.260> my<00:01:23.070> PVR<00:01:23.370> is<00:01:23.520> terrible<00:01:23.910> so<00:01:23.940> obviously

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
however my PVR is terrible so obviously

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.570 
however my PVR is terrible so obviously
it's<00:01:24.720> not<00:01:24.780> gonna<00:01:24.960> record<00:01:25.260> live<00:01:25.470> gameplay<00:01:25.770> so

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
it's not gonna record live gameplay so

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:27.500 
it's not gonna record live gameplay so
that's<00:01:26.700> why<00:01:26.820> i<00:01:26.850> always<00:01:26.940> have<00:01:27.210> to<00:01:27.300> record

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:27.510 
that's why i always have to record

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:30.410 
that's why i always have to record
theater<00:01:27.840> mode<00:01:27.960> games<00:01:28.230> and<00:01:28.590> theater<00:01:29.460> mode<00:01:29.640> has

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
theater mode games and theater mode has

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.450 
theater mode games and theater mode has
its<00:01:30.930> own<00:01:31.140> bullshit<00:01:31.590> to<00:01:31.770> deal<00:01:31.800> with<00:01:32.160> so<00:01:32.370> it

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
its own bullshit to deal with so it

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.820 
its own bullshit to deal with so it
doesn't<00:01:32.760> record<00:01:33.030> for<00:01:33.480> ground<00:01:33.750> war<00:01:33.960> games<00:01:34.170> so

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:34.830 
doesn't record for ground war games so

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:36.860 
doesn't record for ground war games so
that's<00:01:35.340> why<00:01:35.550> this<00:01:35.610> game<00:01:35.910> is<00:01:35.970> like<00:01:36.360> chopped<00:01:36.690> up

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:36.870 
that's why this game is like chopped up

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:38.570 
that's why this game is like chopped up
into<00:01:37.020> segments<00:01:37.560> hopefully<00:01:38.010> you<00:01:38.100> guys<00:01:38.190> enjoyed

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:38.580 
into segments hopefully you guys enjoyed

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:40.760

chilla streak this game and it didn't
save<00:01:47.580> the<00:01:47.760> entire<00:01:47.880> killer<00:01:48.240> i<00:01:48.360> think<00:01:48.510> it<00:01:48.600> only

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:48.690 
save the entire killer i think it only

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:50.300 
save the entire killer i think it only
gets<00:01:48.900> like<00:01:49.050> 15<00:01:49.500> kills<00:01:49.740> or<00:01:49.890> something<00:01:50.190> those

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
gets like 15 kills or something those

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.030 
gets like 15 kills or something those
bums<00:01:50.610> out<00:01:51.080> PS<00:01:52.080> i<00:01:52.290> don't<00:01:52.470> even<00:01:52.620> notice<00:01:52.860> the

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
bums out PS i don't even notice the

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.530 
bums out PS i don't even notice the
difference<00:01:53.280> with<00:01:53.370> the<00:01:53.460> MSMC<00:01:53.910> so<00:01:54.180> i'd<00:01:54.270> still

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
difference with the MSMC so i'd still

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.630 
difference with the MSMC so i'd still
think<00:01:54.750> it's<00:01:54.870> a<00:01:54.930> really<00:01:55.050> good<00:01:55.140> gun<00:01:55.430> anyways<00:01:56.430> not

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
think it's a really good gun anyways not

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.220 
think it's a really good gun anyways not
what<00:01:56.760> i<00:01:56.790> wanted<00:01:57.000> to<00:01:57.090> talk<00:01:57.210> about<00:01:57.270> but<00:01:57.870> thought

00:01:58.220 --> 00:01:58.230 
what i wanted to talk about but thought

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:59.780 
what i wanted to talk about but thought
i'd<00:01:58.350> might<00:01:58.590> as<00:01:58.680> well<00:01:58.830> get<00:01:58.920> that<00:01:59.130> out<00:01:59.280> anyways

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
i'd might as well get that out anyways

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.650 
i'd might as well get that out anyways
