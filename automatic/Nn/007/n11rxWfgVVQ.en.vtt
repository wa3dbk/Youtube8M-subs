stopping<00:00:09.820> doing<00:00:10.150> level<00:00:10.420> videos<00:00:10.690> because<00:00:10.900> they

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:10.990 
stopping doing level videos because they

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:14.490 
stopping doing level videos because they
don't<00:00:11.200> have<00:00:11.490> much<00:00:12.490> need<00:00:12.730> for<00:00:12.790> many<00:00:13.299> more<00:00:13.540> or<00:00:13.840> to

do the video but this is on my leg 01 14
EVR<00:00:18.720> now<00:00:19.720> I<00:00:20.200> believe<00:00:20.980> this<00:00:21.429> is<00:00:21.670> first<00:00:22.029> on

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:22.269 
EVR now I believe this is first on

00:00:22.269 --> 00:00:25.589 
EVR now I believe this is first on
youtube<00:00:22.710> first<00:00:23.710> video<00:00:24.070> 8<00:00:24.310> but<00:00:24.519> anyways<00:00:24.970> it's

00:00:25.589 --> 00:00:25.599 
youtube first video 8 but anyways it's

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:29.700 
youtube first video 8 but anyways it's
some<00:00:26.400> full<00:00:27.400> scale<00:00:27.670> to<00:00:27.880> the<00:00:28.000> real<00:00:28.150> m14<00:00:28.810> EBR<00:00:28.839> as

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:29.710 
some full scale to the real m14 EBR as

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:33.090 
some full scale to the real m14 EBR as
far<00:00:30.160> as<00:00:30.519> the<00:00:31.060> gun<00:00:31.300> itself<00:00:31.419> goes<00:00:31.900> I<00:00:32.230> don't<00:00:32.710> know

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:33.100 
far as the gun itself goes I don't know

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.300 
far as the gun itself goes I don't know
the<00:00:33.280> barrel<00:00:33.580> length<00:00:34.260> the<00:00:35.260> receiver<00:00:35.770> length<00:00:36.010> or

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:36.310 
the barrel length the receiver length or

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:39.810 
the barrel length the receiver length or
the<00:00:36.760> stock<00:00:37.539> or<00:00:37.870> the<00:00:37.989> butt<00:00:38.140> length<00:00:38.399> but<00:00:39.399> I<00:00:39.579> know

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:39.820 
the stock or the butt length but I know

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:41.940 
the stock or the butt length but I know
it's<00:00:40.180> full<00:00:40.360> scale<00:00:40.690> length<00:00:41.050> wise<00:00:41.350> not<00:00:41.649> like

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:41.950 
it's full scale length wise not like

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:46.740 
it's full scale length wise not like
like<00:00:42.699> every<00:00:43.180> part<00:00:43.449> is<00:00:43.690> to<00:00:44.140> scale<00:00:45.510> so<00:00:46.510> i<00:00:46.539> just

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:46.750 
like every part is to scale so i just

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:48.630 
like every part is to scale so i just
did<00:00:46.989> the<00:00:47.110> best<00:00:47.260> that<00:00:47.379> I<00:00:47.469> could<00:00:47.649> so<00:00:48.280> I<00:00:48.309> hope

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.719 
little well by made but it's right there
just<00:01:15.490> like<00:01:15.729> a<00:01:15.790> lever<00:01:16.150> and<00:01:17.369> you<00:01:18.369> could<00:01:18.520> see<00:01:18.640> the

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:18.729 
just like a lever and you could see the

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:20.160 
just like a lever and you could see the
magazine<00:01:19.090> oil<00:01:19.270> doesn't<00:01:19.479> go<00:01:19.689> up<00:01:19.840> all<00:01:20.020> the<00:01:20.049> way

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:20.170 
magazine oil doesn't go up all the way

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:22.830 
magazine oil doesn't go up all the way
to<00:01:20.350> go<00:01:20.740> but<00:01:21.700> I'm<00:01:21.970> going<00:01:22.210> to<00:01:22.270> dummy<00:01:22.450> around<00:01:22.720> in

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:22.840 
to go but I'm going to dummy around in

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.999 
to go but I'm going to dummy around in
there<00:01:23.079> and<00:01:23.909> then<00:01:24.909> inside<00:01:25.390> that<00:01:25.810> I<00:01:26.110> have<00:01:26.710> more

00:01:26.999 --> 00:01:27.009 
there and then inside that I have more

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:33.780 
there and then inside that I have more
rounds<00:01:28.590> yes<00:01:29.590> I<00:01:29.799> guess<00:01:31.920> but<00:01:32.920> therefore<00:01:33.310> when<00:01:33.670> I

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:33.790 
rounds yes I guess but therefore when I

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:36.840 
rounds yes I guess but therefore when I
eject<00:01:34.270> this<00:01:34.420> show<00:01:34.689> I<00:01:34.930> totally<00:01:35.770> need<00:01:36.130> five<00:01:36.430> but

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:36.850 
eject this show I totally need five but

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:38.490 
eject this show I totally need five but
i<00:01:36.880> have<00:01:37.149> five<00:01:37.420> I've<00:01:37.659> already<00:01:37.810> taken<00:01:38.049> one<00:01:38.229> out

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:38.500 
i have five I've already taken one out

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.789 
i have five I've already taken one out
that's<00:01:38.799> why<00:01:38.979> you<00:01:39.040> only<00:01:39.159> saw<00:01:39.399> four<00:01:40.560> and<00:01:41.560> then

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:41.799 
that's why you only saw four and then

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:45.620 
that's why you only saw four and then
put<00:01:42.520> my<00:01:42.640> Union<00:01:43.000> just<00:01:43.180> like<00:01:43.329> any<00:01:43.479> other<00:01:43.570> gun

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
put my Union just like any other gun

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.160 
put my Union just like any other gun
let's<00:01:46.630> do<00:01:46.750> that<00:01:47.340> and<00:01:48.340> then<00:01:48.850> here's<00:01:49.659> the<00:01:49.719> shell

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:50.170 
let's do that and then here's the shell

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:57.450 
let's do that and then here's the shell
look<00:01:52.740> Michelle<00:01:53.740> take<00:01:54.130> it<00:01:54.280> out<00:01:55.469> i'll<00:01:56.469> put<00:01:56.530> oil

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:57.460 
look Michelle take it out i'll put oil

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:59.730 
look Michelle take it out i'll put oil
to<00:01:57.700> put<00:01:57.880> it<00:01:58.030> in<00:01:58.149> all<00:01:58.420> you<00:01:58.509> do<00:01:58.659> is<00:01:58.899> pull<00:01:59.710> the

00:01:59.730 --> 00:01:59.740 
to put it in all you do is pull the

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:04.469 
to put it in all you do is pull the
trigger<00:02:00.040> or<00:02:01.539> it<00:02:01.719> with<00:02:02.049> your<00:02:02.200> hand<00:02:03.420> put<00:02:04.420> it

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:04.479 
trigger or it with your hand put it

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:06.840 
trigger or it with your hand put it
in<00:02:04.570> the<00:02:04.630> tray<00:02:04.869> but<00:02:05.590> the<00:02:05.740> boat<00:02:05.890> go<00:02:06.100> forward<00:02:06.640> and

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:06.850 
in the tray but the boat go forward and

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:08.880 
in the tray but the boat go forward and
then<00:02:07.570> it<00:02:07.750> will<00:02:07.840> sink<00:02:08.080> around<00:02:08.410> but<00:02:08.590> it<00:02:08.680> won't

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:08.890 
then it will sink around but it won't

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:11.100 
then it will sink around but it won't
fall<00:02:09.160> forward<00:02:09.580> or<00:02:09.670> backing<00:02:09.880> the<00:02:10.240> gun<00:02:10.420> you'll

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.110 
fall forward or backing the gun you'll

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:15.760 
fall forward or backing the gun you'll
just<00:02:11.320> kind<00:02:11.620> of<00:02:11.650> come<00:02:11.800> out<00:02:11.920> but<00:02:12.310> okay<00:02:12.960> with

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:15.770 
just kind of come out but okay with

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:19.970 
just kind of come out but okay with
it's<00:02:16.770> not<00:02:16.950> a<00:02:18.230> ton<00:02:19.230> of<00:02:19.260> very<00:02:19.530> reliable

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
it's not a ton of very reliable

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.520 
it's not a ton of very reliable
mechanism<00:02:20.490> as<00:02:20.670> you<00:02:20.760> just<00:02:21.000> saw<00:02:21.200> but<00:02:22.200> it<00:02:22.230> still

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
mechanism as you just saw but it still

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.260 
mechanism as you just saw but it still
works<00:02:22.770> I<00:02:23.070> really<00:02:23.340> did<00:02:23.400> make<00:02:23.610> it<00:02:23.670> to<00:02:23.850> shell

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
works I really did make it to shell

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:29.150 
works I really did make it to shell
eject<00:02:24.570> just<00:02:24.810> have<00:02:25.310> some<00:02:26.310> blowback<00:02:26.780> now<00:02:28.160> this

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
eject just have some blowback now this

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
right there quite a quite a long rail

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.270 
right there quite a quite a long rail
system<00:02:35.160> and<00:02:35.550> then<00:02:35.910> some<00:02:36.210> of<00:02:36.240> the<00:02:36.450> side<00:02:37.280> right

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
system and then some of the side right

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.980 
system and then some of the side right
here<00:02:38.550> right<00:02:38.850> there<00:02:40.970> you<00:02:41.970> can<00:02:42.210> accommodate<00:02:42.750> my

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:42.990 
here right there you can accommodate my

holographic sight if you think my

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:47.990

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
holographic sights on backwards you're

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.540 
holographic sights on backwards you're
wrong<00:02:48.240> this<00:02:49.140> is<00:02:49.350> how<00:02:49.590> you<00:02:49.650> would<00:02:50.010> put<00:02:50.310> them<00:02:50.460> a

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550 
wrong this is how you would put them a

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:52.790 
wrong this is how you would put them a

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
back and note you nuts the front I when

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:00.800 
back and note you nuts the front I when
I<00:02:59.040> first<00:02:59.310> was<00:02:59.730> these<00:02:59.970> in<00:03:00.090> it<00:03:00.240> I<00:03:00.390> thought<00:03:00.450> it<00:03:00.690> was

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
I first was these in it I thought it was

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:04.640 
I first was these in it I thought it was
this<00:03:00.990> way<00:03:01.250> but<00:03:02.250> my<00:03:02.370> friend<00:03:02.730> warthog<00:03:03.600> 217<00:03:04.380> is

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
this way but my friend warthog 217 is

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:07.340 
this way but my friend warthog 217 is
renamed<00:03:05.160> Ricky<00:03:05.550> it<00:03:06.150> would<00:03:06.330> cost<00:03:06.510> rate<00:03:06.870> is<00:03:07.080> that

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350 
renamed Ricky it would cost rate is that

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:10.280 
renamed Ricky it would cost rate is that
owns<00:03:07.560> a<00:03:07.710> whole<00:03:08.220> buncha<00:03:08.550> guns<00:03:08.730> including<00:03:09.290> an

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:13.320 
accessory called holographic sight and I

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:15.290 
accessory called holographic sight and I
thought<00:03:13.980> it<00:03:14.040> was<00:03:14.130> my<00:03:14.190> banker<00:03:14.370> to<00:03:14.670> it<00:03:14.850> wasn't<00:03:15.180> he

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:15.300 
thought it was my banker to it wasn't he

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:18.140 
thought it was my banker to it wasn't he
told<00:03:15.510> me<00:03:15.630> the<00:03:15.750> whole<00:03:15.900> it's<00:03:16.560> not<00:03:16.710> so<00:03:17.040> it<00:03:17.190> but

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
told me the whole it's not so it but

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:19.810 
told me the whole it's not so it but
this<00:03:18.270> is<00:03:18.330> how<00:03:18.540> you<00:03:18.600> use<00:03:18.690> a<00:03:18.870> holographic<00:03:19.230> sight

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:19.820 
this is how you use a holographic sight

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:24.710 
this is how you use a holographic sight
and<00:03:20.820> the<00:03:21.510> red<00:03:21.690> dot<00:03:21.900> is<00:03:22.850> fat<00:03:23.850> self<00:03:24.150> explanatory

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
and the red dot is fat self explanatory

and the red dot is fat self explanatory
you<00:03:24.930> look<00:03:25.760> like<00:03:26.760> this<00:03:26.940> looks<00:03:27.630> like<00:03:27.780> that<00:03:27.930> and

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:28.520 
you look like this looks like that and

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:32.300 
you look like this looks like that and
looks<00:03:29.520> pretty<00:03:29.760> cool<00:03:29.910> on<00:03:30.060> the<00:03:30.180> f-14<00:03:30.630> but<00:03:31.310> i'm

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
looks pretty cool on the f-14 but i'm

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.990 
looks pretty cool on the f-14 but i'm
showing<00:03:32.580> you<00:03:32.670> can<00:03:32.880> put<00:03:33.000> anything<00:03:33.180> you<00:03:33.330> want

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:35.000 
showing you can put anything you want

got<00:03:46.920> cheatgrass<00:03:47.220> on<00:03:47.610> its<00:03:47.820> like<00:03:47.970> it<00:03:48.150> look

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
got cheatgrass on its like it look

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:51.040 
got cheatgrass on its like it look
through<00:03:48.720> your<00:03:48.750> sight<00:03:49.020> picture<00:03:49.050> perfectly

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:51.050 
through your sight picture perfectly

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:53.870 
through your sight picture perfectly
like<00:03:52.050> that<00:03:52.260> and

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:53.880 
like that and

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:55.790 
like that and
then<00:03:54.450> the<00:03:54.600> trigger<00:03:54.840> guard<00:03:54.960> is<00:03:55.410> kind<00:03:55.620> of<00:03:55.710> small

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:55.800 
then the trigger guard is kind of small

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:58.490 
then the trigger guard is kind of small
my<00:03:56.160> fingers<00:03:56.690> jammed<00:03:57.690> in<00:03:57.870> there<00:03:58.020> when<00:03:58.170> i<00:03:58.260> try<00:03:58.470> to

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
my fingers jammed in there when i try to

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:03.350 
my fingers jammed in there when i try to
shoot<00:03:59.630> but<00:04:00.630> it's<00:04:01.160> still<00:04:02.160> works<00:04:02.430> the<00:04:03.180> hand

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:03.360 
shoot but it's still works the hand

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:06.440 
shoot but it's still works the hand
guard<00:04:03.540> is<00:04:03.810> a<00:04:03.840> floating<00:04:04.260> handguard<00:04:05.210> not<00:04:06.210> really

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.450 
guard is a floating handguard not really

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:10.430 
guard is a floating handguard not really
floating<00:04:06.750> but<00:04:07.050> i<00:04:07.790> have<00:04:08.790> one<00:04:09.270> by<00:04:09.450> one<00:04:09.690> pieces<00:04:10.170> in

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:10.440 
floating but i have one by one pieces in

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:12.920 
floating but i have one by one pieces in
there<00:04:10.590> that<00:04:11.460> have<00:04:11.700> studs<00:04:12.090> on<00:04:12.240> the<00:04:12.330> side<00:04:12.630> I

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:12.930 
there that have studs on the side I

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:16.430 
there that have studs on the side I
think<00:04:13.470> you<00:04:13.890> should<00:04:14.100> note<00:04:14.250> that<00:04:14.280> is<00:04:14.610> but<00:04:15.450> at<00:04:16.080> and

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 
think you should note that is but at and

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:19.330 
think you should note that is but at and
then<00:04:16.590> I<00:04:16.620> put<00:04:16.860> these<00:04:17.040> pieces<00:04:17.340> there<00:04:17.730> to<00:04:18.480> make<00:04:18.630> it

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:19.340 
then I put these pieces there to make it

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:23.870 
then I put these pieces there to make it
kind<00:04:20.340> of<00:04:20.489> look<00:04:20.940> like<00:04:20.970> it's<00:04:21.300> floating<00:04:22.880> even

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:23.880 
kind of look like it's floating even

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:25.970 
kind of look like it's floating even
though<00:04:23.970> it's<00:04:24.120> not<00:04:24.270> just<00:04:24.990> on<00:04:25.590> there<00:04:25.800> pretty

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:25.980 
though it's not just on there pretty

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:29.780 
though it's not just on there pretty

tips<00:04:42.110> now<00:04:43.110> let's<00:04:43.380> try<00:04:44.840> I'm<00:04:45.840> going<00:04:45.990> to<00:04:46.050> take<00:04:46.140> the

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:46.290 
tips now let's try I'm going to take the

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:47.480 
tips now let's try I'm going to take the
handle<00:04:46.560> off<00:04:46.680> because<00:04:46.890> you<00:04:47.010> won't<00:04:47.220> be<00:04:47.280> able<00:04:47.370> to

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:47.490 
handle off because you won't be able to
