welcome<00:00:04.250> back<00:00:04.460> to<00:00:04.640> the<00:00:04.730> second<00:00:05.060> part<00:00:05.300> of<00:00:05.479> our

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:05.600 
welcome back to the second part of our

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:07.240 
welcome back to the second part of our
guide<00:00:05.840> to<00:00:06.170> laying<00:00:06.380> a<00:00:06.500> real<00:00:06.710> wood<00:00:06.950> or<00:00:07.220> a

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:07.250 
guide to laying a real wood or a

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:10.270 
guide to laying a real wood or a
laminate<00:00:07.880> wood<00:00:08.210> floor<00:00:08.599> so<00:00:09.260> the<00:00:09.620> underlay<00:00:09.980> is

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:10.280 
laminate wood floor so the underlay is

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:12.040 
laminate wood floor so the underlay is
down<00:00:10.700> and<00:00:11.030> we're<00:00:11.270> on<00:00:11.360> to<00:00:11.510> the<00:00:11.600> actual<00:00:11.810> bit

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:12.050 
down and we're on to the actual bit

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:13.360 
down and we're on to the actual bit
where<00:00:12.200> we<00:00:12.290> actually<00:00:12.380> lay<00:00:12.680> the<00:00:12.830> board<00:00:13.010> so<00:00:13.280> the

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:13.370 
where we actually lay the board so the

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:15.280 
where we actually lay the board so the
first<00:00:13.580> thing<00:00:13.820> to<00:00:13.850> do<00:00:14.090> is<00:00:14.330> to<00:00:14.630> check<00:00:14.840> which<00:00:15.080> way

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:15.290 
first thing to do is to check which way

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:16.990 
first thing to do is to check which way
round<00:00:15.620> the<00:00:16.039> boards<00:00:16.340> are<00:00:16.460> going<00:00:16.550> to<00:00:16.640> go<00:00:16.789> we're

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:17.000 
round the boards are going to go we're

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.029 
round the boards are going to go we're
in<00:00:17.090> the<00:00:17.150> corner<00:00:17.480> of<00:00:17.570> the<00:00:17.689> room<00:00:17.900> and<00:00:18.140> you<00:00:18.859> have

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:19.039 
in the corner of the room and you have

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:21.040 
in the corner of the room and you have
to<00:00:19.189> check<00:00:19.400> whether<00:00:19.550> or<00:00:19.789> not<00:00:19.999> it's<00:00:20.300> the<00:00:20.449> tongue

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:21.050 
to check whether or not it's the tongue

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:22.720 
to check whether or not it's the tongue
or<00:00:21.259> the<00:00:21.380> groove<00:00:21.589> side<00:00:21.890> which<00:00:22.099> goes<00:00:22.310> against

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:22.730 
or the groove side which goes against

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:23.829 
or the groove side which goes against
the<00:00:22.820> wall<00:00:22.999> so<00:00:23.359> we've<00:00:23.480> checked<00:00:23.659> with<00:00:23.720> the

00:00:23.829 --> 00:00:23.839 
the wall so we've checked with the

00:00:23.839 --> 00:00:25.300 
the wall so we've checked with the
instructions<00:00:24.349> and<00:00:24.499> in<00:00:24.589> this<00:00:24.710> case<00:00:24.919> it's

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:25.310 
instructions and in this case it's

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:27.130 
instructions and in this case it's
actually<00:00:25.789> the<00:00:26.239> tongue<00:00:26.480> side<00:00:26.720> which<00:00:26.929> goes

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:27.140 
actually the tongue side which goes

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:30.040 
actually the tongue side which goes
against<00:00:27.739> the<00:00:28.039> wall<00:00:28.249> as<00:00:28.939> we<00:00:29.060> do<00:00:29.210> that<00:00:29.390> we've<00:00:29.929> got

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:30.050 
against the wall as we do that we've got

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:31.540 
against the wall as we do that we've got
our<00:00:30.169> spacers<00:00:30.800> which<00:00:30.980> we've<00:00:31.159> got<00:00:31.189> in<00:00:31.460> our

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:31.550 
our spacers which we've got in our

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:34.330 
our spacers which we've got in our
fitting<00:00:31.999> pack<00:00:32.360> and<00:00:33.290> we're<00:00:33.950> gonna<00:00:34.100> lay<00:00:34.280> the

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:34.340 
fitting pack and we're gonna lay the

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:37.240 
fitting pack and we're gonna lay the
first<00:00:34.550> board<00:00:34.880> hard<00:00:35.570> against<00:00:35.870> the<00:00:35.989> wall<00:00:36.250> but

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:37.250 
first board hard against the wall but

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:39.939 
first board hard against the wall but
space<00:00:37.699> are<00:00:37.910> there<00:00:38.170> to<00:00:39.170> give<00:00:39.320> a<00:00:39.350> gap<00:00:39.590> now<00:00:39.769> that

00:00:39.939 --> 00:00:39.949 
space are there to give a gap now that

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:41.439 
space are there to give a gap now that
expansion<00:00:40.370> get<00:00:40.670> remember<00:00:41.000> is<00:00:41.149> really

00:00:41.439 --> 00:00:41.449 
expansion get remember is really

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:42.939 
expansion get remember is really
important<00:00:41.960> because<00:00:42.019> this<00:00:42.260> is<00:00:42.320> a<00:00:42.500> real<00:00:42.739> wood

00:00:42.939 --> 00:00:42.949 
important because this is a real wood

00:00:42.949 --> 00:00:44.950 
important because this is a real wood
floor<00:00:43.190> so<00:00:43.370> it's<00:00:43.489> likely<00:00:43.910> that<00:00:44.059> it<00:00:44.300> will<00:00:44.449> expand

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:44.960 
floor so it's likely that it will expand

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:46.660 
floor so it's likely that it will expand
and<00:00:45.109> contract<00:00:45.260> so<00:00:45.920> you'll<00:00:46.070> have<00:00:46.129> a<00:00:46.219> gap<00:00:46.460> at<00:00:46.640> the

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:46.670 
and contract so you'll have a gap at the

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:49.569 
and contract so you'll have a gap at the
edges<00:00:47.379> so<00:00:48.379> it<00:00:48.500> gives<00:00:48.679> it<00:00:48.739> a<00:00:48.800> chance<00:00:48.829> to<00:00:49.219> do<00:00:49.339> that

00:00:49.569 --> 00:00:49.579 
edges so it gives it a chance to do that

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:51.819 
edges so it gives it a chance to do that
start<00:00:50.420> putting<00:00:50.690> them<00:00:50.780> together<00:00:50.870> just

00:00:51.819 --> 00:00:51.829 
start putting them together just

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:53.439 
start putting them together just
literally<00:00:52.339> just<00:00:52.820> put<00:00:53.030> them<00:00:53.120> together<00:00:53.210> they

00:00:53.439 --> 00:00:53.449 
literally just put them together they

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:56.169 
literally just put them together they
click<00:00:53.629> together<00:00:53.839> really<00:00:54.109> easily<00:00:54.230> okay<00:00:55.039> now<00:00:55.699> we

00:00:56.169 --> 00:00:56.179 
click together really easily okay now we

00:00:56.179 --> 00:00:57.610 
click together really easily okay now we
are<00:00:56.210> gonna<00:00:56.480> glue<00:00:56.719> this<00:00:56.929> but<00:00:57.199> we're<00:00:57.320> not<00:00:57.350> gonna

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:57.620 
are gonna glue this but we're not gonna

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:00.189 
are gonna glue this but we're not gonna
glue<00:00:57.920> it<00:00:57.949> yet<00:00:58.489> okay<00:00:59.359> you<00:00:59.420> don't<00:00:59.629> have<00:00:59.780> to<00:00:59.929> glue

00:01:00.189 --> 00:01:00.199 
glue it yet okay you don't have to glue

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:01.810 
glue it yet okay you don't have to glue
it<00:01:00.320> but<00:01:00.440> I<00:01:00.469> like<00:01:00.710> to<00:01:00.829> glue<00:01:01.010> close<00:01:01.219> a<00:01:01.249> nice<00:01:01.460> solid

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:01.820 
it but I like to glue close a nice solid

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:03.700 
it but I like to glue close a nice solid
floor<00:01:02.089> okay<00:01:02.570> so<00:01:02.839> what<00:01:03.019> we<00:01:03.109> can<00:01:03.170> do<00:01:03.289> is<00:01:03.379> just<00:01:03.530> run

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:03.710 
floor okay so what we can do is just run

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:05.290 
floor okay so what we can do is just run
a<00:01:03.739> line<00:01:03.949> up<00:01:04.159> there<00:01:04.370> so<00:01:04.550> we<00:01:04.670> go<00:01:04.790> straight<00:01:05.059> it<00:01:05.180> and

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:05.300 
a line up there so we go straight it and

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.300 
a line up there so we go straight it and
work<00:01:05.449> out<00:01:05.630> how<00:01:05.990> straight<00:01:06.500> the<00:01:06.680> back<00:01:06.830> wall<00:01:07.100> is

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:07.310 
work out how straight the back wall is

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:09.640 
work out how straight the back wall is
okay<00:01:07.760> because<00:01:07.880> why<00:01:08.840> is<00:01:08.900> that<00:01:09.050> important<00:01:09.620> I

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:09.650 
okay because why is that important I

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:11.170 
okay because why is that important I
spent<00:01:09.920> enough<00:01:10.100> time<00:01:10.130> doing<00:01:10.460> this<00:01:10.670> so<00:01:10.820> your

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:11.180 
spent enough time doing this so your

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:13.000 
spent enough time doing this so your
first<00:01:11.450> three<00:01:11.720> runs<00:01:11.960> are<00:01:12.170> absolutely<00:01:12.680> spot-on

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:13.010 
first three runs are absolutely spot-on

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:14.350 
first three runs are absolutely spot-on
it<00:01:13.400> saves<00:01:13.640> you<00:01:13.730> an<00:01:13.790> awful<00:01:14.090> lot<00:01:14.180> of<00:01:14.210> more

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:14.360 
it saves you an awful lot of more

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.720 
it saves you an awful lot of more
aggravation<00:01:14.780> and<00:01:15.020> further<00:01:15.200> across<00:01:15.530> the<00:01:15.680> board

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:18.730 

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:21.820 

so<00:01:19.730> this<00:01:19.880> would<00:01:20.000> be<00:01:20.060> one<00:01:20.240> long<00:01:20.750> board<00:01:21.260> connect

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:21.830 
so this would be one long board connect

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:28.360 
so this would be one long board connect
them<00:01:21.950> all<00:01:22.070> together<00:01:22.250> right<00:01:22.760> away<00:01:27.370> spaces

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:28.370 
them all together right away spaces

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:30.760 
them all together right away spaces
couple<00:01:29.030> more<00:01:29.120> spaces<00:01:29.600> here's<00:01:30.080> a<00:01:30.140> half<00:01:30.410> board

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:30.770 
couple more spaces here's a half board

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:32.200 
couple more spaces here's a half board
is<00:01:31.010> the<00:01:31.160> last<00:01:31.310> thing<00:01:31.460> we<00:01:31.520> want<00:01:31.610> to<00:01:31.850> do<00:01:31.970> is<00:01:32.120> to

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:32.210 
is the last thing we want to do is to

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:33.970 
is the last thing we want to do is to
have<00:01:32.330> the<00:01:32.480> joints<00:01:32.810> all<00:01:33.020> in<00:01:33.410> the<00:01:33.530> same<00:01:33.680> place

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:33.980 
have the joints all in the same place

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:35.140 
have the joints all in the same place
because<00:01:34.130> it'll<00:01:34.430> create<00:01:34.580> a<00:01:34.640> weakness<00:01:34.910> so<00:01:35.030> they

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:35.150 
because it'll create a weakness so they

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:36.550 
because it'll create a weakness so they
got<00:01:35.240> to<00:01:35.330> be<00:01:35.390> staggered<00:01:35.810> like<00:01:35.930> a<00:01:36.020> brick<00:01:36.350> wall

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:36.560 
got to be staggered like a brick wall

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.370

stops<00:03:11.860> it<00:03:11.950> moving<00:03:12.250> too<00:03:12.459> much<00:03:12.730> and<00:03:13.420> then<00:03:13.540> we've

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
stops it moving too much and then we've

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:14.910 
stops it moving too much and then we've
got<00:03:13.810> this<00:03:13.930> quadrant<00:03:14.440> which<00:03:14.590> we<00:03:14.709> bought

earlier if you remember this is just a
finishing<00:03:17.049> strip<00:03:17.380> now<00:03:17.500> this<00:03:17.680> that's<00:03:17.860> right

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 
finishing strip now this that's right

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:19.380
