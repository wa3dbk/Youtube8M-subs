I guess he wants to be annoyed with it
uh<00:03:54.599> I<00:03:54.870> don't<00:03:55.080> carrots<00:03:55.590> I<00:03:56.390> like<00:03:57.390> it<00:03:57.599> I<00:03:57.720> think<00:03:57.900> the

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:58.170 
uh I don't carrots I like it I think the

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:02.240 
uh I don't carrots I like it I think the
thing<00:03:58.380> is<00:03:58.410> fine<00:03:58.910> it's<00:03:59.910> just<00:04:00.030> this<00:04:00.980> laptops<00:04:01.980> and

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250 
thing is fine it's just this laptops and

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:04.990 
thing is fine it's just this laptops and
 whatever<00:04:02.640> you<00:04:02.790> want<00:04:02.940> put<00:04:03.060> in<00:04:03.180> it<00:04:03.330> um<00:04:04.319> I

 whatever you want put in it um I

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.699 
 whatever you want put in it um I
guess<00:04:06.000> as<00:04:06.239> far<00:04:06.270> as<00:04:06.450> tractors<00:04:06.930> go<00:04:07.110> it's<00:04:07.319> pretty

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:07.709 
guess as far as tractors go it's pretty

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:10.820 
guess as far as tractors go it's pretty
well<00:04:07.860> loaded<00:04:09.140> you<00:04:10.140> know<00:04:10.230> it's<00:04:10.380> got<00:04:10.560> a<00:04:10.590> place

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:43.500 
you can see that is these wheels this

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:46.430 
you can see that is these wheels this
thing<00:04:43.740> is<00:04:43.889> about<00:04:44.010> as<00:04:44.310> narrow<00:04:44.700> as<00:04:45.020> it's<00:04:46.020> narrow

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:46.440 
thing is about as narrow as it's narrow

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:48.860 
thing is about as narrow as it's narrow
I<00:04:46.860> mean<00:04:47.250> it's<00:04:47.400> not<00:04:47.550> I<00:04:47.820> think<00:04:48.120> Tim's<00:04:48.330> Jeep<00:04:48.660> is

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:48.870 
I mean it's not I think Tim's Jeep is

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:50.030 
I mean it's not I think Tim's Jeep is
wider<00:04:49.080> than<00:04:49.229> the<00:04:49.470> front<00:04:49.710> end<00:04:49.830> of<00:04:49.889> this<00:04:49.979> thing

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:50.040 
wider than the front end of this thing

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:51.530 
wider than the front end of this thing
so<00:04:50.430> we're<00:04:50.910> going<00:04:51.000> to<00:04:51.060> do<00:04:51.180> is<00:04:51.300> we're<00:04:51.389> going<00:04:51.479> to

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:51.540 
so we're going to do is we're going to

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:53.659 
so we're going to do is we're going to
put<00:04:51.720> that<00:04:51.900> tire<00:04:52.139> over<00:04:52.169> there<00:04:52.470> and<00:04:52.830> that<00:04:53.460> tire

00:04:53.659 --> 00:04:53.669

over<00:04:53.700> there<00:04:54.300> and<00:04:54.990> that<00:04:55.169> will<00:04:55.350> dish<00:04:55.680> them<00:04:55.950> out

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:56.130 
over there and that will dish them out

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:58.490 
over there and that will dish them out
so<00:04:56.580> that<00:04:56.610> they're<00:04:56.910> wider<00:04:57.150> and<00:04:57.479> we<00:04:58.110> will<00:04:58.289> also

00:04:58.490 --> 00:04:58.500

the<00:06:06.110> Nebraska<00:06:06.319> tests<00:06:06.919> were<00:06:07.009> much<00:06:07.189> higher<00:06:07.370> but

00:06:07.749 --> 00:06:07.759 
the Nebraska tests were much higher but

00:06:07.759 --> 00:06:10.840
