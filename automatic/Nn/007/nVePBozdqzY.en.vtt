here<00:00:00.510> we<00:00:00.570> have<00:00:00.690> an<00:00:00.810> unboxing<00:00:01.110> of<00:00:01.469> the<00:00:01.620> msi<00:00:02.129> h61

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:03.090 
here we have an unboxing of the msi h61

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.660 
here we have an unboxing of the msi h61
MP<00:00:03.840> 31<00:00:04.319> g3<00:00:04.890> i<00:00:05.069> know<00:00:06.060> kind<00:00:06.480> of<00:00:06.509> an<00:00:06.629> annoying<00:00:06.930> name

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:07.670 
MP 31 g3 i know kind of an annoying name

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:12.350 
MP 31 g3 i know kind of an annoying name
but<00:00:08.670> this<00:00:08.880> is<00:00:09.090> a<00:00:09.500> peach<00:00:10.500> 61<00:00:11.099> board<00:00:11.400> with<00:00:11.910> a<00:00:11.940> PCI

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
but this is a peach 61 board with a PCI

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:13.370 
but this is a peach 61 board with a PCI
Express<00:00:12.630> gen3

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
Express gen3

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.090 
Express gen3
it<00:00:14.280> also<00:00:14.400> supports<00:00:14.940> up<00:00:15.210> here<00:00:15.830> 22<00:00:16.830> nanometers

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
it also supports up here 22 nanometers

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.420 
it also supports up here 22 nanometers
so<00:00:17.400> that's<00:00:17.670> anything<00:00:17.880> from<00:00:18.140> core<00:00:19.140> i3<00:00:19.590> well

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
so that's anything from core i3 well

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.090 
so that's anything from core i3 well
let's<00:00:20.609> say<00:00:20.760> Sandy<00:00:21.180> Bridge<00:00:21.330> through<00:00:22.100> Ivy

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
let's say Sandy Bridge through Ivy

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:28.339 
let's say Sandy Bridge through Ivy
Bridge<00:00:23.340> core<00:00:24.920> i7<00:00:25.920> to<00:00:26.220> Celeron<00:00:26.910> based<00:00:27.349> let's

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
Bridge core i7 to Celeron based let's

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.859 
Bridge core i7 to Celeron based let's
see<00:00:28.619> you<00:00:28.800> have<00:00:28.980> it<00:00:29.910> just<00:00:30.060> says<00:00:30.300> your<00:00:30.449> supports

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
see you have it just says your supports

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.340
