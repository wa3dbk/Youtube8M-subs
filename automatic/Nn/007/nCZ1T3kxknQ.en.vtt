tune or not
nice<00:01:24.030> yeah<00:01:24.960> but<00:01:25.259> not<00:01:26.040> many<00:01:26.340> or<00:01:26.759> any<00:01:27.030> in<00:01:27.390> fact<00:01:27.750> do

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
nice yeah but not many or any in fact do

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.640 
nice yeah but not many or any in fact do
this<00:01:29.390> where<00:01:30.390> I<00:01:30.420> can<00:01:30.630> now<00:01:30.750> see<00:01:30.900> all<00:01:31.020> six<00:01:31.409> strings

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
this where I can now see all six strings

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:32.960 
this where I can now see all six strings
and<00:01:31.950> actually<00:01:32.159> they're<00:01:32.280> all<00:01:32.400> slightly<00:01:32.579> flat

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
and actually they're all slightly flat

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.580 
and actually they're all slightly flat
you<00:01:33.150> can<00:01:33.299> just<00:01:33.479> sort<00:01:33.630> of<00:01:33.689> see<00:01:36.439> which<00:01:37.439> is

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
you can just sort of see which is

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.080 
you can just sort of see which is
essentially<00:01:38.100> that<00:01:38.250> was<00:01:38.430> the<00:01:38.610> big<00:01:38.790> selling

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
essentially that was the big selling

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.730 
essentially that was the big selling
point<00:01:39.299> of<00:01:39.360> the<00:01:39.509> original<00:01:39.600> they've<00:01:40.229> lost<00:01:40.439> a<00:01:40.590> big

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
point of the original they've lost a big

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.740 
point of the original they've lost a big
selling<00:01:41.040> point<00:01:41.250> and<00:01:41.490> obviously<00:01:42.150> is<00:01:42.329> still<00:01:42.630> is

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
selling point and obviously is still is

the<00:03:30.269> other<00:03:30.450> one<00:03:30.660> sets<00:03:31.019> whether<00:03:31.440> and<00:03:31.880> you're

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 
the other one sets whether and you're

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.400 
the other one sets whether and you're
basically<00:03:33.180> talking<00:03:33.390> through<00:03:33.720> flat<00:03:33.989> chewings

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.410 
basically talking through flat chewings

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:35.930 
basically talking through flat chewings
or<00:03:34.769> let's<00:03:35.040> say<00:03:35.160> I've<00:03:35.250> got<00:03:35.280> the<00:03:35.459> needle<00:03:35.670> mode

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
or let's say I've got the needle mode

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:37.340 
or let's say I've got the needle mode
now<00:03:36.180> let<00:03:36.360> me<00:03:36.420> show<00:03:36.600> them<00:03:36.720> the<00:03:36.840> needle<00:03:37.170> mode

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:37.350 
now let me show them the needle mode

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:39.680 
now let me show them the needle mode
needle<00:03:38.250> mode<00:03:38.430> I<00:03:38.760> think<00:03:39.150> I've<00:03:39.239> got<00:03:39.360> the<00:03:39.450> regular

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
needle mode I think I've got the regular

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:42.259 
needle mode I think I've got the regular
needle<00:03:39.840> mode<00:03:40.080> let's<00:03:40.500> see<00:03:40.820> that<00:03:41.820> it<00:03:42.030> looks<00:03:42.150> like

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:42.269 
needle mode let's see that it looks like

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:44.810 
needle mode let's see that it looks like
the<00:03:42.480> Newton<00:03:42.720> would<00:03:43.400> yeah<00:03:44.400> so<00:03:44.549> that's<00:03:44.730> the

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:44.820 
the Newton would yeah so that's the

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:47.150 
the Newton would yeah so that's the
needle<00:03:45.060> mode<00:03:45.980> see

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
needle mode see

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.970 
needle mode see
and<00:03:48.120> if<00:03:48.600> I<00:03:48.690> go<00:03:48.840> back<00:03:48.870> to<00:03:49.050> what<00:03:49.680> was<00:03:49.800> the<00:03:49.890> other

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
and if I go back to what was the other

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:51.710 
and if I go back to what was the other
Matt<00:03:50.160> this<00:03:50.310> this<00:03:50.610> one<00:03:50.790> I<00:03:50.820> think<00:03:50.940> wasn't<00:03:51.360> his<00:03:51.480> -

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
Matt this this one I think wasn't his -

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.710 
Matt this this one I think wasn't his -
yeah<00:03:52.020> that<00:03:52.200> one<00:03:52.380> so<00:03:52.830> if<00:03:52.920> you<00:03:52.950> press<00:03:53.220> twice

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:53.720 
yeah that one so if you press twice

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:55.070 
yeah that one so if you press twice
there<00:03:54.720> you<00:03:54.780> go

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:55.080 
there you go

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:58.550 
there you go
once<00:03:55.410> again<00:03:55.620> there<00:03:56.430> you<00:03:56.640> so<00:03:57.480> that's<00:03:57.690> the<00:03:57.900> very

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 
once again there you so that's the very

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.140 
once again there you so that's the very
act<00:03:58.830> restore<00:03:59.190> mode<00:03:59.370> you<00:03:59.430> just<00:03:59.460> have<00:03:59.760> to<00:03:59.850> store

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150 
act restore mode you just have to store

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:03.800 
act restore mode you just have to store
it<00:04:00.180> no<00:04:01.170> so<00:04:01.500> now<00:04:01.740> you<00:04:01.800> can<00:04:02.010> do<00:04:02.160> me<00:04:02.310> oh<00:04:02.610> I<00:04:03.420> see<00:04:03.690> what

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:08.700 
you mean by strobe that's like you have

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:10.520 
you mean by strobe that's like you have
your<00:04:08.880> own<00:04:09.060> little<00:04:09.180> mini<00:04:09.360> disco<00:04:09.840> watch<00:04:10.050> there's

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.530 
your own little mini disco watch there's

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:13.760 
your own little mini disco watch there's
a<00:04:10.560> guitar<00:04:11.090> that's<00:04:12.090> cold<00:04:12.630> and<00:04:12.900> it<00:04:13.410> you<00:04:13.560> know<00:04:13.590> it

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:13.770 
a guitar that's cold and it you know it

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:15.080 
a guitar that's cold and it you know it
takes<00:04:13.980> a<00:04:14.070> little<00:04:14.190> getting<00:04:14.310> used<00:04:14.700> to<00:04:14.760> but<00:04:14.970> if

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.090 
takes a little getting used to but if

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:16.970 
takes a little getting used to but if
you<00:04:15.210> want<00:04:15.450> that<00:04:15.690> absolutely<00:04:16.410> perfect

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:19.350 
intonation you know stroke mode is

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:22.070 
intonation you know stroke mode is
definitely<00:04:19.770> way<00:04:19.890> to<00:04:19.950> go<00:04:20.780> look<00:04:21.780> at<00:04:21.900> that

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:22.080 
definitely way to go look at that

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:23.840 
definitely way to go look at that
intonation<00:04:22.500> on<00:04:22.650> this<00:04:22.800> guitar<00:04:23.100> is<00:04:23.190> almost

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:23.850 
intonation on this guitar is almost

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:30.560 
intonation on this guitar is almost
perfect<00:04:25.010> hey<00:04:26.010> it's<00:04:26.160> a<00:04:26.220> Chapman<00:04:28.610> that's<00:04:29.610> give

phone<00:05:13.200> what<00:05:13.650> are<00:05:13.710> you<00:05:13.770> reading<00:05:13.890> the<00:05:14.010> battery

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:14.280 
phone what are you reading the battery

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:16.100 
phone what are you reading the battery
lasts<00:05:14.490> in<00:05:14.670> something<00:05:14.940> like<00:05:15.030> that<00:05:15.240> it's<00:05:15.720> you

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:16.110 
lasts in something like that it's you

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:18.440 
lasts in something like that it's you
know<00:05:16.140> it's<00:05:16.560> funny<00:05:17.550> because<00:05:17.700> it<00:05:18.000> says<00:05:18.150> the

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:18.450 
know it's funny because it says the

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:19.850 
know it's funny because it says the
battery<00:05:18.720> life<00:05:18.930> was<00:05:19.080> one<00:05:19.260> of<00:05:19.350> the<00:05:19.440> things<00:05:19.590> that

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:19.860 
battery life was one of the things that

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:22.250 
battery life was one of the things that
we<00:05:19.980> struggled<00:05:20.430> the<00:05:20.490> most<00:05:20.610> with<00:05:20.760> a<00:05:21.090> Prada<00:05:22.050> tuned

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:22.260 
we struggled the most with a Prada tuned

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:25.220 
we struggled the most with a Prada tuned
too<00:05:22.470> many<00:05:22.710> like<00:05:22.890> this<00:05:23.040> one<00:05:23.280> takes<00:05:24.120> around<00:05:24.630> 80

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:25.230 
too many like this one takes around 80

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:28.580 
too many like this one takes around 80
to<00:05:25.380> 90<00:05:25.770> milliamps<00:05:26.280> to<00:05:26.490> run<00:05:26.700> if<00:05:27.300> this<00:05:28.290> took<00:05:28.560> the

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:28.590 
to 90 milliamps to run if this took the

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:29.840 
to 90 milliamps to run if this took the
same<00:05:28.830> amount<00:05:28.950> of<00:05:29.100> power<00:05:29.250> it<00:05:29.430> would<00:05:29.550> die<00:05:29.790> you

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:29.850 
same amount of power it would die you

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:31.220 
same amount of power it would die you
wouldn't<00:05:30.270> even<00:05:30.330> be<00:05:30.510> able<00:05:30.540> to<00:05:30.690> last<00:05:30.900> the<00:05:31.050> cake

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:31.230 
wouldn't even be able to last the cake

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:33.110 
wouldn't even be able to last the cake
yeah<00:05:31.620> so<00:05:31.860> obviously<00:05:32.010> we<00:05:32.400> had<00:05:32.520> to<00:05:32.610> improve<00:05:32.730> that

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:33.120 
yeah so obviously we had to improve that

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:36.650 
yeah so obviously we had to improve that
and<00:05:33.840> it<00:05:34.320> took<00:05:34.500> a<00:05:34.830> long<00:05:35.670> time<00:05:35.730> to<00:05:35.970> do<00:05:36.240> this<00:05:36.510> has

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:36.660 
and it took a long time to do this has

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:37.880 
and it took a long time to do this has
been<00:05:36.810> a<00:05:36.840> massive<00:05:37.140> challenge<00:05:37.410> to<00:05:37.500> do<00:05:37.620> and<00:05:37.830> the

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:37.890 
been a massive challenge to do and the

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:39.770 
been a massive challenge to do and the
way<00:05:38.010> we<00:05:38.160> did<00:05:38.250> it's<00:05:38.430> actually<00:05:38.790> we<00:05:39.210> invited<00:05:39.600> all

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:39.780 
way we did it's actually we invited all

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:41.540 
way we did it's actually we invited all
the<00:05:39.990> we<00:05:40.350> said<00:05:40.500> to<00:05:40.650> all<00:05:40.800> the<00:05:40.920> engineers<00:05:41.010> the

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:41.550 
the we said to all the engineers the

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:45.020 
the we said to all the engineers the
guitar<00:05:41.850> engineers<00:05:42.210> that<00:05:42.510> for<00:05:42.870> every<00:05:44.030> 0.1

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:45.030 
guitar engineers that for every 0.1

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:46.910 
guitar engineers that for every 0.1
milli<00:05:45.300> amp<00:05:45.510> that<00:05:45.720> they<00:05:45.870> shaved<00:05:46.170> off<00:05:46.410> the<00:05:46.620> the

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:46.920 
milli amp that they shaved off the the

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:49.280 
milli amp that they shaved off the the
the<00:05:47.220> power<00:05:47.430> consumption<00:05:47.820> they<00:05:48.810> got<00:05:48.990> a<00:05:49.020> beer

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:49.290 
the power consumption they got a beer

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:52.250 
the power consumption they got a beer
and<00:05:49.790> they<00:05:50.790> ended<00:05:51.090> up<00:05:51.210> actually<00:05:51.480> it<00:05:51.810> cost<00:05:52.050> a<00:05:52.170> lot

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:52.260 
and they ended up actually it cost a lot

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:55.310 
and they ended up actually it cost a lot
of<00:05:52.350> beer<00:05:52.470> because<00:05:52.650> this<00:05:53.360> uses<00:05:54.360> between<00:05:54.930> five

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:55.320 
of beer because this uses between five

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:58.100 
of beer because this uses between five
to<00:05:55.680> eight<00:05:56.490> milliamps<00:05:57.240> this<00:05:57.419> was<00:05:57.570> 80<00:05:57.780> so<00:05:57.990> that

00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:58.110 
to eight milliamps this was 80 so that

00:05:58.110 --> 00:05:59.480 
to eight milliamps this was 80 so that
when<00:05:58.260> I<00:05:58.350> came<00:05:58.650> up<00:05:58.770> with<00:05:58.830> that<00:05:58.979> has<00:05:59.160> actually

00:05:59.480 --> 00:05:59.490 
when I came up with that has actually

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:00.480 
when I came up with that has actually
died<00:05:59.669> from<00:05:59.910> the<00:06:00.030> other<00:06:00.150> boys

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:00.490 
died from the other boys

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:02.820 
died from the other boys
yes<00:06:00.729> yes<00:06:01.210> but<00:06:01.449> he<00:06:01.509> died<00:06:01.690> happy<00:06:01.900> he<00:06:02.319> died<00:06:02.500> happy

much<00:06:10.449> you<00:06:10.630> use<00:06:10.660> it<00:06:11.050> but<00:06:11.229> you<00:06:11.440> know<00:06:11.560> if<00:06:11.860> you<00:06:12.039> use

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:12.250 
much you use it but you know if you use

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:13.499 
much you use it but you know if you use
it<00:06:12.430> say<00:06:12.610> once<00:06:12.940> a<00:06:13.090> day

00:06:13.499 --> 00:06:13.509 
it say once a day

00:06:13.509 --> 00:06:16.140 
it say once a day
yeah<00:06:13.930> twice<00:06:14.229> a<00:06:14.289> day<00:06:14.590> the<00:06:15.580> battery<00:06:15.880> life<00:06:16.120> is

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:16.150 
yeah twice a day the battery life is

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:19.260 
yeah twice a day the battery life is
easily<00:06:16.690> between<00:06:17.039> you<00:06:18.039> know<00:06:18.190> eight<00:06:18.759> month<00:06:19.090> and

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:19.270 
easily between you know eight month and

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:20.580 
easily between you know eight month and
a<00:06:19.330> year<00:06:19.569> so<00:06:19.840> and<00:06:20.020> it's<00:06:20.110> just<00:06:20.289> like<00:06:20.440> a<00:06:20.470> little
