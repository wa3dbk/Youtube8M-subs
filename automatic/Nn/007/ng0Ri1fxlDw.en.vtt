in the next year or so I thought it'd be
interesting<00:01:31.590> to<00:01:31.950> talk<00:01:32.130> about<00:01:32.189> certain<00:01:32.729> things

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
interesting to talk about certain things

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.700 
interesting to talk about certain things
that<00:01:33.210> we<00:01:33.630> miss<00:01:33.900> from<00:01:34.110> this<00:01:34.259> game<00:01:34.439> that<00:01:34.590> we

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
that we miss from this game that we

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.020 
that we miss from this game that we
might<00:01:34.950> want<00:01:35.130> to<00:01:35.189> see<00:01:35.400> return<00:01:35.729> to<00:01:35.909> the

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
might want to see return to the

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.030 
might want to see return to the
battlefield<00:01:36.150> series<00:01:36.750> now<00:01:37.290> the<00:01:37.350> first<00:01:37.560> item

compiled is jungle environment now as

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:42.980 
compiled is jungle environment now as
you<00:01:41.729> can<00:01:41.850> see<00:01:41.909> here<00:01:42.240> i<00:01:42.270> am<00:01:42.509> playing<00:01:42.720> on<00:01:42.840> the

you can see here i am playing on the

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.510 
you can see here i am playing on the
valparaiso<00:01:43.530> map<00:01:43.799> which<00:01:43.979> is<00:01:44.130> pretty<00:01:44.399> much

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
valparaiso map which is pretty much

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.639 
valparaiso map which is pretty much
entirely<00:01:45.060> based<00:01:45.450> in<00:01:45.630> the<00:01:45.720> jungle<00:01:46.049> not

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
entirely based in the jungle not

entirely based in the jungle not
battlefield<00:01:47.070> 3<00:01:47.369> really<00:01:47.670> does<00:01:47.790> lack<00:01:48.030> in<00:01:48.240> jungle

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
battlefield 3 really does lack in jungle

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.179 
battlefield 3 really does lack in jungle
environments<00:01:49.079> they're<00:01:49.229> mainly<00:01:49.439> urban<00:01:50.009> and

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
environments they're mainly urban and

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.010 
environments they're mainly urban and
desert<00:01:50.610> based<00:01:50.820> environments<00:01:51.420> now<00:01:51.840> I've

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
desert based environments now I've

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.569 
desert based environments now I've
actually<00:01:52.200> noticed<00:01:52.680> that<00:01:52.799> coming<00:01:53.040> back<00:01:53.220> to<00:01:53.430> bad

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
actually noticed that coming back to bad

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.580 
actually noticed that coming back to bad
company<00:01:53.939> 2<00:01:54.119> it<00:01:54.390> took<00:01:54.600> me<00:01:54.659> a<00:01:54.750> little<00:01:54.869> while<00:01:55.020> to

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
company 2 it took me a little while to

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.139 
company 2 it took me a little while to
adjust<00:01:55.710> to<00:01:56.070> spotting<00:01:56.640> the<00:01:56.700> enemy<00:01:56.939> in<00:01:57.090> the

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
adjust to spotting the enemy in the

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.450 
adjust to spotting the enemy in the
jungle<00:01:57.479> again<00:01:57.570> because<00:01:57.930> in<00:01:58.770> these<00:01:58.890> darker

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
jungle again because in these darker

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:00.980 
jungle again because in these darker
greener<00:01:59.850> environments<00:02:00.420> it's<00:02:00.509> actually<00:02:00.840> much

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
greener environments it's actually much

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.480 
greener environments it's actually much
more<00:02:01.200> difficult<00:02:01.409> to<00:02:01.619> spot<00:02:01.979> the<00:02:02.159> enemy<00:02:02.280> that

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
more difficult to spot the enemy that

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:03.950 
more difficult to spot the enemy that
you're<00:02:02.610> fighting<00:02:02.790> again<00:02:03.060> so<00:02:03.360> that<00:02:03.570> is

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
you're fighting again so that is

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:04.789 
you're fighting again so that is
something<00:02:04.079> that<00:02:04.320> I<00:02:04.380> think<00:02:04.439> will<00:02:04.619> be<00:02:04.770> really

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
something that I think will be really

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.499 
something that I think will be really
interesting<00:02:05.009> to<00:02:05.460> see<00:02:05.700> brought<00:02:05.939> back<00:02:06.149> into<00:02:06.390> the

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
interesting to see brought back into the

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.059 
interesting to see brought back into the
battlefield<00:02:06.990> series<00:02:07.200> in<00:02:07.560> battlefield<00:02:07.979> 4

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
battlefield series in battlefield 4

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.219 
battlefield series in battlefield 4
whilst<00:02:08.759> battlefield<00:02:09.270> 3<00:02:09.599> had<00:02:09.750> a<00:02:09.780> real<00:02:09.989> great

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
whilst battlefield 3 had a real great

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.440 
whilst battlefield 3 had a real great
variation<00:02:10.979> in<00:02:11.129> maps<00:02:11.340> I<00:02:11.550> think<00:02:11.819> aesthetically

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
variation in maps I think aesthetically

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.730 
variation in maps I think aesthetically
a<00:02:12.569> lot<00:02:12.840> of<00:02:12.930> them<00:02:13.020> did<00:02:13.200> seem<00:02:13.410> very

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
a lot of them did seem very

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.230 
a lot of them did seem very
similar<00:02:13.980> things<00:02:14.250> like<00:02:14.400> kargh<00:02:14.700> Island<00:02:15.090> and

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
similar things like kargh Island and

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:16.850 
similar things like kargh Island and
nosh<00:02:15.390> our<00:02:15.570> canals<00:02:15.900> seem<00:02:16.170> very<00:02:16.380> similar<00:02:16.710> and

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
nosh our canals seem very similar and

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.620 
nosh our canals seem very similar and
then<00:02:17.250> things<00:02:17.460> like<00:02:17.520> operation<00:02:18.090> metro<00:02:18.450> and

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
then things like operation metro and

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:20.360 
then things like operation metro and
send<00:02:18.840> crossing<00:02:19.260> seem<00:02:19.680> you<00:02:19.860> know<00:02:19.890> very<00:02:20.190> very

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
send crossing seem you know very very

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:21.680 
send crossing seem you know very very
similar<00:02:20.610> so<00:02:20.850> I<00:02:21.090> think<00:02:21.210> it'll<00:02:21.390> be<00:02:21.420> good<00:02:21.570> in

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
similar so I think it'll be good in

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.930 
similar so I think it'll be good in
battlefield<00:02:22.110> 4<00:02:22.170> to<00:02:22.470> see<00:02:22.650> kind<00:02:23.160> of<00:02:23.250> a<00:02:23.370> variation

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
battlefield 4 to see kind of a variation

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:25.520 
battlefield 4 to see kind of a variation
in<00:02:24.060> aesthetic<00:02:24.510> so<00:02:24.660> each<00:02:24.840> map<00:02:25.110> had<00:02:25.260> its<00:02:25.380> own

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
in aesthetic so each map had its own

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.290 
in aesthetic so each map had its own
kind<00:02:25.710> of<00:02:25.830> feel<00:02:26.070> of<00:02:26.310> environment<00:02:26.970> with<00:02:27.090> it<00:02:27.210> I

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
kind of feel of environment with it I

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:28.940 
kind of feel of environment with it I
think<00:02:27.360> will<00:02:27.570> be<00:02:27.660> pretty<00:02:27.900> cool<00:02:28.140> now<00:02:28.590> whilst

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
think will be pretty cool now whilst

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:30.560 
think will be pretty cool now whilst
we're<00:02:29.190> on<00:02:29.280> the<00:02:29.370> subject<00:02:29.610> of<00:02:29.850> variation

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570 
we're on the subject of variation

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:32.090 
we're on the subject of variation
something<00:02:30.930> that<00:02:31.050> I<00:02:31.080> really<00:02:31.350> enjoyed<00:02:31.830> in<00:02:31.950> bad

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
something that I really enjoyed in bad

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.010 
something that I really enjoyed in bad
company<00:02:32.310> to<00:02:32.640> the<00:02:32.670> battlefield<00:02:33.330> 3<00:02:33.570> lacked<00:02:33.780> was

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.020 
company to the battlefield 3 lacked was

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:36.320 
company to the battlefield 3 lacked was
a<00:02:34.050> variation<00:02:34.620> in<00:02:34.770> weapon<00:02:35.190> types<00:02:35.400> now<00:02:36.030> what<00:02:36.300> I

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
a variation in weapon types now what I

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:37.970 
a variation in weapon types now what I
mean<00:02:36.480> by<00:02:36.540> that<00:02:36.660> is<00:02:36.960> of<00:02:37.110> course<00:02:37.260> battlefield<00:02:37.770> 3

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
mean by that is of course battlefield 3

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:39.380 
mean by that is of course battlefield 3
has<00:02:38.100> a<00:02:38.130> lot<00:02:38.310> more<00:02:38.430> variation<00:02:39.030> in<00:02:39.120> actual

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
has a lot more variation in actual

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.570 
has a lot more variation in actual
weapons<00:02:39.840> and<00:02:39.990> a<00:02:40.020> wider<00:02:40.290> field<00:02:40.440> of<00:02:40.800> weapons<00:02:41.130> but

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
weapons and a wider field of weapons but

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:43.340 
weapons and a wider field of weapons but
bad<00:02:41.730> company<00:02:42.120> 2<00:02:42.270> had<00:02:42.570> some<00:02:42.780> Second<00:02:43.200> World<00:02:43.230> War

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
bad company 2 had some Second World War

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:45.080 
bad company 2 had some Second World War
weapons<00:02:43.830> which<00:02:44.010> I<00:02:44.220> really<00:02:44.730> have<00:02:44.880> missed

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
weapons which I really have missed

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:46.520 
weapons which I really have missed
actually<00:02:45.450> because<00:02:45.600> I<00:02:45.660> did<00:02:45.810> enjoy<00:02:46.080> using<00:02:46.320> those

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
actually because I did enjoy using those

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.440 
actually because I did enjoy using those
on<00:02:46.740> bad<00:02:46.920> company<00:02:47.100> 2<00:02:47.460> now<00:02:47.940> of<00:02:48.060> course<00:02:48.210> there

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
on bad company 2 now of course there

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.150 
on bad company 2 now of course there
were<00:02:48.570> reasons<00:02:48.840> for<00:02:49.170> this<00:02:49.260> the<00:02:49.560> campaign

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
were reasons for this the campaign

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:51.560 
were reasons for this the campaign
started<00:02:50.640> in<00:02:50.730> the<00:02:50.820> Second<00:02:51.090> World<00:02:51.120> War<00:02:51.240> so<00:02:51.480> it

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
started in the Second World War so it

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:53.420 
started in the Second World War so it
kind<00:02:51.690> of<00:02:51.720> tired<00:02:51.990> into<00:02:52.230> the<00:02:52.320> campaign<00:02:52.710> but

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
kind of tired into the campaign but

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.070 
kind of tired into the campaign but
actually<00:02:53.910> when<00:02:54.060> battlefield<00:02:54.510> 3<00:02:54.750> brought<00:02:54.990> out

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 
actually when battlefield 3 brought out

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.780 
actually when battlefield 3 brought out
the<00:02:55.230> extra<00:02:55.410> map<00:02:55.620> pack<00:02:55.830> of<00:02:56.010> back<00:02:56.220> to<00:02:56.370> karkand

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
the extra map pack of back to karkand

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.850 
the extra map pack of back to karkand
the<00:02:56.850> Haddam<00:02:57.180> things<00:02:57.600> like<00:02:57.780> Wake<00:02:58.230> Island<00:02:58.470> in<00:02:58.770> I

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
the Haddam things like Wake Island in I

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.110 
the Haddam things like Wake Island in I
was<00:02:58.950> actually<00:02:59.100> hoping<00:02:59.430> the<00:02:59.700> mat<00:02:59.850> have<00:02:59.970> been

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
was actually hoping the mat have been

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:01.940 
was actually hoping the mat have been
some<00:03:00.390> Second<00:03:00.990> World<00:03:01.020> War<00:03:01.140> weapons<00:03:01.590> to<00:03:01.680> go<00:03:01.800> with

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
some Second World War weapons to go with

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:03.320 
some Second World War weapons to go with
that<00:03:02.100> because<00:03:02.250> when<00:03:02.730> I<00:03:02.760> used<00:03:02.910> to<00:03:02.970> play<00:03:03.090> back

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
that because when I used to play back

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:05.240 
that because when I used to play back
company<00:03:03.630> to<00:03:03.810> a<00:03:03.840> lot<00:03:04.140> I<00:03:04.260> always<00:03:04.470> like<00:03:04.950> to<00:03:04.980> use

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
company to a lot I always like to use

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:07.610 
company to a lot I always like to use
the<00:03:05.370> m1a1<00:03:05.790> Thompson<00:03:06.150> submachine<00:03:06.540> gun<00:03:07.050> and<00:03:07.290> the

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
the m1a1 Thompson submachine gun and the

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.410 
the m1a1 Thompson submachine gun and the
m1<00:03:08.250> garand<00:03:08.370> as<00:03:08.760> well<00:03:08.910> it<00:03:08.970> was<00:03:09.060> quite<00:03:09.240> a<00:03:09.270> good

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
m1 garand as well it was quite a good

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.030 
m1 garand as well it was quite a good
rifle<00:03:09.600> so<00:03:09.990> they're<00:03:10.470> the<00:03:10.560> kind<00:03:10.710> of<00:03:10.770> things<00:03:10.950> that

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
rifle so they're the kind of things that

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.890 
rifle so they're the kind of things that
I've<00:03:11.130> missed<00:03:11.430> for<00:03:12.030> bad<00:03:12.180> company<00:03:12.330> 2<00:03:12.690> that<00:03:12.870> I

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
I've missed for bad company 2 that I

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:13.940 
I've missed for bad company 2 that I
think<00:03:13.050> will<00:03:13.110> be<00:03:13.230> quite<00:03:13.410> cool<00:03:13.620> to<00:03:13.740> see<00:03:13.860> in

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
think will be quite cool to see in

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:15.740 
think will be quite cool to see in
battlefield<00:03:14.370> 4<00:03:14.430> if<00:03:14.760> we<00:03:14.880> saw<00:03:15.060> a<00:03:15.240> kind<00:03:15.450> of<00:03:15.510> a

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
battlefield 4 if we saw a kind of a

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:17.570 
battlefield 4 if we saw a kind of a
mixture<00:03:16.350> of<00:03:16.440> weapons<00:03:16.830> from<00:03:16.920> different<00:03:17.400> time

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:17.580 
mixture of weapons from different time

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:19.610 
mixture of weapons from different time
periods<00:03:18.030> rather<00:03:18.240> than<00:03:18.390> just<00:03:18.630> all<00:03:18.840> of<00:03:19.110> you<00:03:19.530> know

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
periods rather than just all of you know

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.020 
periods rather than just all of you know
state-of-the-art<00:03:20.130> weapons<00:03:20.610> because<00:03:20.820> it

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
state-of-the-art weapons because it

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:22.790 
state-of-the-art weapons because it
worked<00:03:21.210> quite<00:03:21.510> well<00:03:21.570> in<00:03:21.810> bad<00:03:21.960> company<00:03:22.110> 2<00:03:22.410> and

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:22.800 
worked quite well in bad company 2 and

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.920 
worked quite well in bad company 2 and
as<00:03:22.890> I<00:03:23.010> said<00:03:23.070> it<00:03:23.370> did<00:03:23.550> add<00:03:23.760> some<00:03:24.390> nice<00:03:24.510> variation

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
as I said it did add some nice variation

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:26.510 
as I said it did add some nice variation
to<00:03:25.200> the<00:03:25.290> game<00:03:25.470> now<00:03:26.100> one<00:03:26.250> of<00:03:26.280> the<00:03:26.370> most

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:26.520 
to the game now one of the most

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:28.040 
to the game now one of the most
noticeable<00:03:26.850> and<00:03:27.210> important<00:03:27.660> things<00:03:27.840> on<00:03:28.020> my

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:28.050 
noticeable and important things on my

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:30.020 
noticeable and important things on my
list<00:03:28.170> is<00:03:28.530> destruction<00:03:29.010> now<00:03:29.370> before<00:03:29.550> you<00:03:29.700> guys

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
list is destruction now before you guys

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:31.580 
list is destruction now before you guys
go<00:03:30.300> and<00:03:30.420> try<00:03:30.630> and<00:03:30.750> hang<00:03:30.900> me<00:03:31.050> by<00:03:31.170> the<00:03:31.230> neck<00:03:31.410> I

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
go and try and hang me by the neck I

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.200 
go and try and hang me by the neck I
know<00:03:31.680> that<00:03:31.800> battlefield<00:03:32.160> 3<00:03:32.520> does<00:03:32.760> have<00:03:32.970> a<00:03:33.000> lot

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:33.210 
know that battlefield 3 does have a lot

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:34.820 
know that battlefield 3 does have a lot
of<00:03:33.270> destruction<00:03:33.720> in<00:03:33.870> the<00:03:33.960> game<00:03:34.140> but<00:03:34.560> i<00:03:34.650> think

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:34.830 
of destruction in the game but i think

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:36.260 
of destruction in the game but i think
it<00:03:34.920> is<00:03:34.950> arguable<00:03:35.430> but<00:03:35.670> battlefield<00:03:36.120> bad

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:36.270 
it is arguable but battlefield bad

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:38.060 
it is arguable but battlefield bad
company<00:03:36.480> 2<00:03:36.840> has<00:03:37.110> a<00:03:37.140> lot<00:03:37.290> more<00:03:37.320> useful<00:03:37.650> and

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:38.070 
company 2 has a lot more useful and

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:39.800 
company 2 has a lot more useful and
interesting<00:03:38.430> and<00:03:38.760> noticeable<00:03:39.270> destruction

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
interesting and noticeable destruction

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:41.750 
interesting and noticeable destruction
than<00:03:40.140> battlefield<00:03:40.560> 3<00:03:40.800> and<00:03:41.280> I<00:03:41.370> think<00:03:41.640> that<00:03:41.730> has

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
than battlefield 3 and I think that has

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.880 
than battlefield 3 and I think that has
to<00:03:41.910> do<00:03:42.030> with<00:03:42.210> building<00:03:42.480> modulation<00:03:43.140> now<00:03:43.710> on

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:43.890 
to do with building modulation now on

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:45.830 
to do with building modulation now on
battlefield<00:03:44.340> 3<00:03:44.610> a<00:03:44.640> lot<00:03:44.940> of<00:03:45.030> the<00:03:45.090> maps<00:03:45.330> have

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
battlefield 3 a lot of the maps have

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.690 
battlefield 3 a lot of the maps have
buildings<00:03:46.320> acting<00:03:46.800> as<00:03:46.920> the<00:03:47.070> edge<00:03:47.220> of<00:03:47.400> the<00:03:47.520> map

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:47.700 
buildings acting as the edge of the map

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:49.310 
buildings acting as the edge of the map
for<00:03:47.940> example<00:03:48.300> saying<00:03:48.540> crossing<00:03:48.930> so<00:03:49.080> a<00:03:49.140> lot<00:03:49.290> of

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:49.320 
for example saying crossing so a lot of

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:50.690 
for example saying crossing so a lot of
those<00:03:49.470> buildings<00:03:49.650> can't<00:03:50.040> be<00:03:50.190> completely

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700 
those buildings can't be completely

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:52.610 
those buildings can't be completely
destroyed<00:03:50.850> whilst<00:03:51.690> by<00:03:51.900> company<00:03:52.260> to<00:03:52.440> the

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
destroyed whilst by company to the

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.530 
destroyed whilst by company to the
buildings<00:03:52.980> all<00:03:53.160> act<00:03:53.400> as<00:03:53.580> individual<00:03:54.150> modules

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
buildings all act as individual modules

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:55.880 
buildings all act as individual modules
so<00:03:54.690> every<00:03:55.050> single<00:03:55.380> building<00:03:55.530> can<00:03:55.860> be

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:55.890 
so every single building can be

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:57.590 
so every single building can be
flattened<00:03:56.340> there<00:03:56.820> are<00:03:56.910> no<00:03:57.030> maps<00:03:57.270> on<00:03:57.450> bad

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:57.600 
flattened there are no maps on bad

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:58.850 
flattened there are no maps on bad
company<00:03:57.780> 2<00:03:58.170> where<00:03:58.380> the<00:03:58.470> buildings<00:03:58.830> themselves

00:03:58.850 --> 00:03:58.860 
company 2 where the buildings themselves

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:01.640 
company 2 where the buildings themselves
act<00:03:59.490> as<00:03:59.790> the<00:03:59.910> edge<00:04:00.030> of<00:04:00.150> the<00:04:00.270> map<00:04:00.480> so<00:04:01.140> I<00:04:01.170> think<00:04:01.410> on

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 
act as the edge of the map so I think on

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:03.230 
act as the edge of the map so I think on
bad<00:04:01.830> company<00:04:01.980> 2<00:04:02.310> the<00:04:02.460> destruction<00:04:02.970> is<00:04:03.060> a<00:04:03.090> lot

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:03.240 
bad company 2 the destruction is a lot

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:05.150 
bad company 2 the destruction is a lot
more<00:04:03.420> useful<00:04:03.630> and<00:04:04.080> it<00:04:04.500> just<00:04:04.680> seems<00:04:04.860> to<00:04:04.980> play

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:05.160 
more useful and it just seems to play

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:06.440 
more useful and it just seems to play
out<00:04:05.280> a<00:04:05.310> lot<00:04:05.520> more<00:04:05.610> interestingly<00:04:05.880> because

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.450 
out a lot more interestingly because

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:08.300 
out a lot more interestingly because
every<00:04:06.690> single<00:04:06.990> building<00:04:07.110> is<00:04:07.410> destructible<00:04:07.860> so

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310 
every single building is destructible so

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:09.290 
every single building is destructible so
I<00:04:08.340> think<00:04:08.580> that's<00:04:08.700> something<00:04:08.880> that<00:04:09.030> i'd<00:04:09.180> like

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:09.300 
I think that's something that i'd like

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:11.180

include of course the jet ski that is

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:16.580 
include of course the jet ski that is
something<00:05:15.510> that<00:05:15.600> I've<00:05:15.720> really<00:05:15.960> missed<00:05:16.230> from

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:16.590 
something that I've really missed from

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:18.530 
something that I've really missed from
the<00:05:16.710> battlefield<00:05:17.100> series<00:05:17.280> and<00:05:17.700> the<00:05:18.180> ability

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:18.540 
the battlefield series and the ability

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:20.570 
the battlefield series and the ability
for<00:05:18.570> snipers<00:05:19.200> to<00:05:19.350> call<00:05:19.560> in<00:05:19.740> air<00:05:19.980> strikes<00:05:20.160> or

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:20.580 
for snipers to call in air strikes or

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:22.460 
for snipers to call in air strikes or
mortar<00:05:20.910> strikes<00:05:21.210> now<00:05:21.660> I<00:05:21.690> actually<00:05:21.960> preferred

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:22.470 
mortar strikes now I actually preferred

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:24.770 
mortar strikes now I actually preferred
this<00:05:22.680> idea<00:05:23.070> over<00:05:23.460> the<00:05:23.550> the<00:05:24.090> mortar<00:05:24.450> weapon

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:24.780 
this idea over the the mortar weapon

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:26.540 
this idea over the the mortar weapon
that<00:05:24.870> you<00:05:24.960> can<00:05:25.080> equip<00:05:25.350> in<00:05:25.500> battlefield<00:05:25.980> 3<00:05:26.040> I

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:26.550 
that you can equip in battlefield 3 I

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:27.740 
that you can equip in battlefield 3 I
think<00:05:26.850> there's<00:05:26.970> a<00:05:27.000> lot<00:05:27.090> more<00:05:27.150> balanced<00:05:27.570> for

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:27.750 
think there's a lot more balanced for

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:29.270 
think there's a lot more balanced for
snipers<00:05:28.170> to<00:05:28.320> use<00:05:28.470> is<00:05:28.620> to<00:05:28.710> try<00:05:28.890> and<00:05:28.920> take<00:05:29.100> out

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:29.280 
snipers to use is to try and take out

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:31.310 
snipers to use is to try and take out
other<00:05:29.520> snipers<00:05:30.030> in<00:05:30.060> camping<00:05:30.510> situations<00:05:31.140> I

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:31.320 
other snipers in camping situations I
