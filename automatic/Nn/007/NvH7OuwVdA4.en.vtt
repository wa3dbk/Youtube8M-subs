crossing<00:00:07.290> we're<00:00:07.440> doing<00:00:08.120> whether<00:00:09.120> it's<00:00:09.330> split

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
crossing we're doing whether it's split

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.940 
crossing we're doing whether it's split
time<00:00:10.080> or<00:00:10.800> same<00:00:11.490> time<00:00:11.759> a<00:00:12.290> good<00:00:13.290> habit<00:00:13.769> in

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
you can hold it learn to hold it so

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.939 
you can hold it learn to hold it so
don't<00:00:20.130> just<00:00:20.369> cross<00:00:20.789> and<00:00:21.029> come<00:00:21.150> back<00:00:21.529> cross<00:00:22.529> and

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
don't just cross and come back cross and

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:24.500 
don't just cross and come back cross and
see<00:00:23.130> if<00:00:23.189> you<00:00:23.250> can<00:00:23.400> be<00:00:23.519> comfortable<00:00:24.000> in<00:00:24.330> the

your plants you also want to do this
split<00:00:40.890> time<00:00:43.190> and<00:00:44.190> if<00:00:44.309> you<00:00:44.430> can<00:00:44.670> learn<00:00:44.820> through

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
split time and if you can learn through

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.029 
split time and if you can learn through
the<00:00:45.180> split<00:00:45.539> time<00:00:45.870> and<00:00:46.079> at<00:00:46.140> first<00:00:46.410> don't<00:00:46.860> worry

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
the split time and at first don't worry

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:48.889 
the split time and at first don't worry
it's<00:00:47.190> definitely<00:00:47.579> going<00:00:47.700> to<00:00:47.789> be<00:00:47.879> all<00:00:48.059> fluffy

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
it's definitely going to be all fluffy

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.560 
it's definitely going to be all fluffy
it<00:00:49.590> will<00:00:49.800> lots<00:00:50.730> of<00:00:50.910> stuff<00:00:51.120> you'll<00:00:51.300> be<00:00:51.449> learning

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
it will lots of stuff you'll be learning

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.439 
it will lots of stuff you'll be learning
will<00:00:51.809> be<00:00:51.899> floppy<00:00:52.199> at<00:00:52.530> first<00:00:52.770> normal<00:00:53.399> so<00:00:54.360> you

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
will be floppy at first normal so you

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.119 
will be floppy at first normal so you
can<00:00:54.750> start<00:00:54.989> you<00:00:55.199> can<00:00:55.320> even<00:00:55.410> cross<00:00:55.680> your<00:00:55.710> arms

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
can start you can even cross your arms

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.250 
can start you can even cross your arms
first<00:00:56.340> and<00:00:56.489> just<00:00:56.550> try<00:00:56.760> to<00:00:56.820> and<00:00:57.809> if<00:00:57.930> it's<00:00:58.109> like

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
first and just try to and if it's like

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.900 
first and just try to and if it's like
all<00:00:58.410> floppy<00:00:58.680> floppy<00:00:58.920> don't<00:00:59.280> worry<00:00:59.430> next<00:00:59.670> week

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
all floppy floppy don't worry next week

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.910 
all floppy floppy don't worry next week
it'll<00:01:00.059> be<00:01:00.120> better<00:01:00.300> just<00:01:00.620> to<00:01:01.620> get<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:01.829> process

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
it'll be better just to get the process

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:02.630 
it'll be better just to get the process
started

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
started

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.810 
started
see<00:01:03.270> you<00:01:03.329> can<00:01:03.480> get<00:01:03.570> a<00:01:03.629> forward<00:01:04.159> you<00:01:05.159> know<00:01:05.280> split

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
see you can get a forward you know split

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.880 
see you can get a forward you know split
time<00:01:06.060> going<00:01:06.299> at<00:01:06.360> least<00:01:06.510> a<00:01:06.600> little<00:01:06.750> bit<00:01:06.900> either

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
time going at least a little bit either

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.450 
time going at least a little bit either
harm<00:01:08.490> on<00:01:08.610> top<00:01:08.820> just<00:01:09.510> a<00:01:09.720> little<00:01:09.750> bit<00:01:10.140> and<00:01:11.040> then

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
harm on top just a little bit and then

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.429 
harm on top just a little bit and then
when<00:01:11.580> you<00:01:11.640> do<00:01:11.760> your<00:01:12.020> crossing<00:01:13.020> so<00:01:13.200> you<00:01:13.290> can

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
when you do your crossing so you can

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.140 
when you do your crossing so you can
cross<00:01:13.710> it<00:01:13.740> and<00:01:14.040> do<00:01:14.189> a<00:01:14.220> couple<00:01:14.460> and<00:01:14.790> come<00:01:15.000> back

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
cross it and do a couple and come back

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.810 
cross it and do a couple and come back
and<00:01:15.530> then<00:01:16.530> the<00:01:16.650> other<00:01:16.680> way<00:01:17.130> and<00:01:17.369> do<00:01:17.490> a<00:01:17.520> few

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
and then the other way and do a few

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.969 
and then the other way and do a few
spins<00:01:18.150> and<00:01:18.420> come<00:01:18.540> back<00:01:18.720> and<00:01:19.590> you'll<00:01:19.740> start

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
spins and come back and you'll start

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.640 
spins and come back and you'll start
getting<00:01:20.070> because<00:01:21.049> our<00:01:22.049> body<00:01:22.290> you<00:01:22.439> know<00:01:22.530> we

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
getting because our body you know we

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.170 
getting because our body you know we
don't<00:01:22.740> typically<00:01:23.130> do<00:01:23.369> a<00:01:23.400> lot<00:01:23.610> like<00:01:23.790> this<00:01:23.939> so

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
don't typically do a lot like this so

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.760 
don't typically do a lot like this so
it's<00:01:24.509> you<00:01:24.869> know<00:01:24.960> it's<00:01:25.110> a<00:01:25.200> bit<00:01:25.350> of<00:01:25.439> psyche<00:01:25.530> as<00:01:25.680> a

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
it's you know it's a bit of psyche as a
