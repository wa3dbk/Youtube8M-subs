00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:12.139
 rudakov hello to all how to know me 

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:13.999
 it's going nickel 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:15.940
 so we end up one of them for my 

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:17.840
 first video commented on fifa 15 

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:19.730
 month this video I will teach you 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:22.099
 a resale buying technique that me 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:23.539
 I use a lot because in fact 

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:26.599
 it allows to make very credits 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:27.710
 quickly easily and what is well 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:29.449
 it's technical that everyone 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:30.589
 can do it because there is need 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:33.800
 to have a lot of credit at the base 

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:36.290
 to use it takes on average 1000 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:39.530
 credits for to use it at the beginning 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:41.000
 what is actually the technique she 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:42.740
 to go to the market for 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.750
 transfers to do a search of 

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:48.410
 post changes and you make a 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:50.150
 search in mda for you to launch the 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:51.140
 search at the immediate purchase price on 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:53.120
 cheaper market 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:55.460
 So there in the video that was 1000 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:58.580
 credits and once you've seen that 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:00.050
 it was 1000 credits and you 

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:01.520
 go back and there you do 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:02.840
 be careful when you go back 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:04.640
 in the transfer market it's 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.449
 well put mda over than the thing 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.890
 that resets to zero 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:09.320
 you do a search for fragments 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:10.399
 change of position but that's all 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.579
 the job changes you are you 

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:17.450
 put it well mda and you launch a 

00:01:13.579 --> 00:01:19.189
 search for 858 without credit and if 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:22.420
 you find nothing at first not you 

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:27.740
 do you make a price change 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:29.060
 ranging from 750 to 850 and that makes me that 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.350
 with the price be you do that with 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:33.649
 funny is worth that is to say that you 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:35.479
 vary between level gold and level everything and 

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:37.700
 do you make it go away because if 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:40.969
 you do that triangle grows each 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:42.859
 times for what to research what 

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:44.240
 the thing actually if you let her 

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:46.819
 not so know you're looking for nothing in 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.350
 done and so that's why it takes 

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:52.009
 need to make changes 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:52.310
 levels and prices to update the 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:56.810
 listing 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:59.119
 so we imagine that you have that you 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.409
 have found that at 800 because it's 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:02.509
 frankly you find at 800 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:04.249
 of them and just be themselves klein 

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:05.359
 fast as austrian almost did not 

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:06.859
 a lot of people above but hey there 

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:08.030
 worked me anyway when 

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:10.490
 even who look for it so must that 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.570
 as soon as you send to 800 do not hesitate 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:13.640
 you do not buy what you die you 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:14.560
 know that it will be below 1000 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.620
 what like you 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:19.690
 start the search and so if you in 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:25.840
 have found 8 without wanting you 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:29.349
 put to 1100 for immediate purchase hebba that 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:32.200
 you already make 300 credit of profits - 

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:34.950
 the tax has made 285 so already if you 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:37.959
 do that with ten job changes 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:40.660
 anyway ad that makes you 2850 of 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:42.280
 profits and where you have during the 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:45.700
 video his share super fast so already from 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:48.700
 1852 profits or the holidays at the same time 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:51.430
 5 minutes and I'll see you in the 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:57.519
 video I bought about 26 I 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:58.860
 had 20/20 800 and 4,450 and two to 200 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:03.780
 I'm really lucky with the colors 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:05.830
 from the 200 and you will see that 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:08.830
 when I start the video I have to 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:10.890
 near 20 28 thousand credit seems to me and I 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:13.030
 finished g37 1000 credits 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:15.030
 I made them in less than ten minutes 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:16.959
 frankly it's going super fast stay in 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:18.780
 so here I let you watch this 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:20.980
 that gives 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:23.350
 so here you see I'm trying 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:26.109

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:09.260
 what you can do too for 

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:12.230
 update the list is when you 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:14.840

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:24.680
 in the transfer objectives and a 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:26.660
