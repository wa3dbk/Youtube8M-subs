00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
redstone pops out of the ground so

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.130 
redstone pops out of the ground so
that's<00:01:47.490> a<00:01:47.670> really<00:01:47.880> neat<00:01:48.090> effect<00:01:48.180> and<00:01:48.630> overall

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
that's a really neat effect and overall

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.440 
that's a really neat effect and overall
this<00:01:49.290> is<00:01:49.350> just<00:01:49.439> a<00:01:49.710> really<00:01:49.979> neat<00:01:50.250> mod<00:01:50.490> it<00:01:51.270> does

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
this is just a really neat mod it does

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.060 
this is just a really neat mod it does
go<00:01:51.600> at<00:01:51.720> number<00:01:51.960> 5<00:01:52.140> though<00:01:52.380> just<00:01:52.710> because<00:01:52.979> of

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
go at number 5 though just because of

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.740 
go at number 5 though just because of
the<00:01:53.159> fact<00:01:53.399> that<00:01:53.490> it<00:01:53.759> isn't<00:01:54.030> a<00:01:54.090> very<00:01:54.240> large<00:01:54.509> mod

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
the fact that it isn't a very large mod

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.270 
the fact that it isn't a very large mod
it<00:01:54.960> doesn't<00:01:55.200> really<00:01:55.290> do<00:01:55.530> anything<00:01:55.950> too

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
it doesn't really do anything too

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.109 
it doesn't really do anything too
extensive

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
extensive

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:58.730 
extensive
so<00:01:57.420> yeah<00:01:57.540> that's<00:01:57.659> why<00:01:57.869> it<00:01:57.930> goes<00:01:58.079> at<00:01:58.259> number<00:01:58.530> 5

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
so yeah that's why it goes at number 5

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.639 
so yeah that's why it goes at number 5
so<00:01:59.130> let's<00:01:59.310> move<00:01:59.490> on<00:01:59.700> to<00:01:59.820> number<00:02:00.390> 4<00:02:00.540> coming<00:02:01.350> in

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
so let's move on to number 4 coming in

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.649 
so let's move on to number 4 coming in
at<00:02:01.890> the<00:02:02.130> number<00:02:02.490> 4<00:02:02.670> spot<00:02:02.820> is<00:02:03.149> damage

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
at the number 4 spot is damage

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.749 
at the number 4 spot is damage
