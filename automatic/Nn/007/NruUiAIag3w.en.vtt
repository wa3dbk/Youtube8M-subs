00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
really low amounts of noise so you can

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.029 
really low amounts of noise so you can
have<00:00:51.120> a<00:00:51.149> really<00:00:51.510> decent<00:00:51.809> conversation<00:00:52.199> inside

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
speeds like the Autobahn that you really

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.210 
speeds like the Autobahn that you really

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:01.720 
but agreement speeds it's really

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.410 
but agreement speeds it's really
acceptable<00:01:02.290> it<00:01:02.350> really<00:01:02.860> comes<00:01:03.640> in<00:01:04.150> the<00:01:04.210> car
