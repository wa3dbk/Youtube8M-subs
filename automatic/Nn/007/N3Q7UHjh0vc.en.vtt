00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
in and this position sure so that it

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.340 
in and this position sure so that it
doesn't<00:01:37.799> blow<00:01:38.520> away<00:01:38.820> or<00:01:39.329> run<00:01:39.540> off<00:01:39.750> once<00:01:40.200> I

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
doesn't blow away or run off once I

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.289

and<00:01:42.600> gets<00:01:42.780> into<00:01:42.960> my<00:01:43.229> roots<00:01:43.530> and<00:01:43.860> gives<00:01:44.820> that

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
and gets into my roots and gives that

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.289 
and gets into my roots and gives that
mint<00:01:45.630> that<00:01:46.229> little<00:01:46.530> extra<00:01:46.950> spring<00:01:47.790> boost<00:01:48.060> it

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
mint that little extra spring boost it

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.899 
mint that little extra spring boost it
needs<00:01:48.329> to<00:01:49.020> last<00:01:49.920> and<00:01:50.220> produce<00:01:50.430> us<00:01:50.640> for<00:01:50.850> the

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
needs to last and produce us for the

I'm<00:01:54.060> just<00:01:54.869> going<00:01:55.079> to<00:01:55.430> set<00:01:56.430> it<00:01:56.579> in<00:01:56.700> with<00:01:56.909> water

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
I'm just going to set it in with water

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:58.700 
I'm just going to set it in with water
and<00:01:57.450> this<00:01:57.600> will<00:01:57.780> make<00:01:57.960> sure<00:01:58.110> that<00:01:58.380> all<00:01:58.530> the
