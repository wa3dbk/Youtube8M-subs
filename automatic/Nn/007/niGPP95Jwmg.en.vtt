00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:22.220 
design let's start off by looking at the

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:23.890 
design let's start off by looking at the
tiger<00:00:22.550> shell<00:00:22.849> stand<00:00:23.119> so<00:00:23.510> this<00:00:23.750> is<00:00:23.869> a

lightweight weighing at only 28 grams

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:32.019 
lightweight weighing at only 28 grams
and<00:00:30.710> it<00:00:30.800> will<00:00:30.890> protect<00:00:31.039> your<00:00:31.460> phone<00:00:31.730> from

face-first<00:00:34.460> on<00:00:34.760> bumpy<00:00:35.180> surfaces<00:00:35.750> the<00:00:36.140> reason

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:36.380 
face-first on bumpy surfaces the reason

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:37.750 
face-first on bumpy surfaces the reason
why<00:00:36.440> this<00:00:36.500> case<00:00:36.800> is<00:00:37.010> so<00:00:37.040> great<00:00:37.430> is<00:00:37.610> the<00:00:37.640> fact

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:37.760 
why this case is so great is the fact

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.240 
why this case is so great is the fact
that<00:00:38.090> it<00:00:38.300> has<00:00:38.510> hidden<00:00:38.840> kickstands<00:00:39.770> but<00:00:39.980> that's

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:40.250 
that it has hidden kickstands but that's

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:41.770 
that it has hidden kickstands but that's
not<00:00:40.430> even<00:00:40.790> the<00:00:40.880> best<00:00:41.060> part

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:41.780 
not even the best part

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:43.120 
not even the best part
the<00:00:41.990> best<00:00:42.170> part<00:00:42.410> is<00:00:42.500> how<00:00:42.620> the<00:00:42.680> kickstand

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:43.130 
the best part is how the kickstand

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:45.070 
the best part is how the kickstand
actually<00:00:43.610> works<00:00:43.940> so<00:00:44.270> they<00:00:44.720> snap<00:00:44.960> together

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:45.080 
actually works so they snap together

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:46.870 
actually works so they snap together
with<00:00:45.470> magnets<00:00:45.890> and<00:00:46.040> there<00:00:46.370> are<00:00:46.460> two<00:00:46.670> positions

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:46.880 
with magnets and there are two positions

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.570 
with magnets and there are two positions
you<00:00:47.360> can<00:00:47.540> adjust<00:00:47.930> it<00:00:48.110> to<00:00:48.140> first<00:00:48.980> position<00:00:49.400> is

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:49.580 
you can adjust it to first position is

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:51.760 
you can adjust it to first position is
at<00:00:49.700> a<00:00:49.730> vertical<00:00:50.030> angle<00:00:50.480> which<00:00:50.990> is<00:00:51.020> ideal<00:00:51.560> if

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:51.770
