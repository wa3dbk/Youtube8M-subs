00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.690
 Hi, people today, I'll talk about the line. 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:11.340
 avon candy from these colonies here 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:14.190
 and I had bet on facebook 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.590
 these two the photo of these two 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.720
 colonies but as I had not yet 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:22.920
 Arrived at this one, I decided to wait. 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:26.460
 To do is complete and I wanted it too. 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:30.779
 get some other perfume so I can 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:33.870
 compare to you is the smell of one with 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:40.250
 the other one but I only managed to highlight is 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:42.629
 so it 's just from here to we had mousse and he 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:46.200
 he is saying in the magazine that he is a 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:49.170
 floral gurman moral does not excuse fruity 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:52.890
 gurman and here in his description is 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:58.070
 cool saying what he has is that 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:01:01.260
 is saying that he has cherry and musse 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:04.860
 I found this team and a monster here. 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:07.439
 much like this from here on the jequiti 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:10.890
 that I want me with magic 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:19.380
 this one has a better fixation this 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:23.460
 here is it is a very very colony 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:25.650
 very weak little does not know he is 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:30.390
 very sweet comes if a little 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:32.610
 sickening when we sneeze both 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:36.119
 to compare they are not very 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:38.729
 similar but with the evolution of the two 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:42.450
 perfumes they look very similar but 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:46.409
 very similar indeed is so I found 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.610
 this one a little lighter than the 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.520
 other not 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:54.869
 and he is well fixing it is not good not 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:59.119
 is a colony and the function is not 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:02:03.240
 cool this one is already an oriental fruit 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:03.890
 and back here saying that he has notes 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:09.530
 citrus fruit 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:14.120
 rain and e combines with vanilla is also 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:18.530
 This is where the great cake is. 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:21.920
 This one too is very very sweet. 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:26.450
 but they are not bad do not know them 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:28.040
 may and may a little bit but it's like 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:32.150
 they are a little lighter than the 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:34.220
 normal perfume and ends up being 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:39.290
 About five minutes ends up well. 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:42.590
 gentle on the skin these colonies and 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:45.739
 last is from here that is the beautiful ipop that I 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:49.519
 nor to ask this one here because it was 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:51.440
 saying that it was a timber and how not 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:54.560
 likes woody perfumes or not 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:56.810
 ask and arrived at the other two already I 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:59.300
 I said I thought it 's not so bad to make a 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:00.890
 Review I think I have to have it soon. 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:03.380
 The three of them in this one I want to talk about 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:04.550
 collection has to talk soon 23 I just 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:07.250
 asking for this 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:08.600
 and in fact it turned out that I 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:11.209
 more like 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:14.239
 when we smell that he does not 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:16.940
 bottle he does not have you can not 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:18.860
 feel his wooden note but when 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:21.560
 you sneeze on the skin 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:25.070
 Do you feel a slight woodworking does not arrive? 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:27.590
 being is a very strong wood not 

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:31.870
 even because it's a hot line , not everyone 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:36.370
 the three of them are very sweet with a good smell of 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:40.070
 of candy so bulletins do not know of 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:43.250
 the kop key this business knows so 

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:47.120
 and I do not think he smells like 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:51.350
 bullet here is saying back here that they 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:56.150
 they are what reminds me of these things 

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:59.079
 so there is one of them is talking this I know 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:59.079
 what spirit 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:07.769
 I'm talking I had not lost but 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:11.430
 I'm talking about the cake business that 

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:15.390
 It was what I thought reminds me of cake. 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:17.639
 so they 're really sweet all three 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:19.650
 does not have any that is like this 

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:20.130
 little bit pulled by a citrus has no 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:22.710
 not 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:25.740
 although from here you're saying you have 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:27.479
 It's a note so it stays with grapes it does not 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:30.300
 becomes a citrus scent neither of 

00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:31.919
 far away are all three very sweet 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:34.139
 so I think it's a line for who 

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:35.639
 really like sweet perfume 

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:39.060
 I think they come to be even a 

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:43.470
 child is not that 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:45.960
 of fine and sophisticated women is not 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:49.500
 12 children's theater images even two 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:51.660
 Most silly you know is so I hope so 

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:54.860
 did you like the review and even the 

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:54.860
