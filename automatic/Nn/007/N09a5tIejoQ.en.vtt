bunch<00:02:14.190> of<00:02:14.340> parts<00:02:14.640> let's<00:02:14.910> take<00:02:15.090> a<00:02:15.120> look<00:02:15.300> at<00:02:15.420> this

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.990 

and<00:02:19.110> these<00:02:19.440> are<00:02:19.500> just<00:02:19.830> basically<00:02:20.220> spare<00:02:20.640> parts

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
and these are just basically spare parts

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.630 
and these are just basically spare parts
from<00:02:21.239> here<00:02:21.420> I<00:02:21.450> mean<00:02:21.720> so<00:02:22.500> I'm<00:02:22.769> gonna<00:02:22.890> make<00:02:23.069> cubes

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
from here I mean so I'm gonna make cubes

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.340 
from here I mean so I'm gonna make cubes
but<00:02:23.790> I<00:02:23.850> also<00:02:24.030> needed<00:02:24.390> these<00:02:24.660> to<00:02:24.989> be<00:02:25.080> able<00:02:25.200> to

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
but I also needed these to be able to

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:27.440 
but I also needed these to be able to
transform<00:02:26.280> these<00:02:26.459> into<00:02:26.819> other<00:02:26.910> things<00:02:27.239> so

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
transform these into other things so

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.570 
transform these into other things so
here<00:02:27.720> we<00:02:27.840> have<00:02:27.959> just<00:02:28.590> like<00:02:28.709> a<00:02:28.739> selection<00:02:29.250> of

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
here we have just like a selection of

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:33.250 
here we have just like a selection of
different<00:02:30.390> kind<00:02:30.600> of<00:02:30.720> parts<00:02:31.200> lots<00:02:31.739> of<00:02:31.860> caps

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
different kind of parts lots of caps

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.860 
different kind of parts lots of caps
these<00:02:34.260> pieces<00:02:34.860> and<00:02:35.250> I'm<00:02:36.150> sure<00:02:36.330> everything's

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
these pieces and I'm sure everything's

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:38.509 
these pieces and I'm sure everything's
here<00:02:37.110> I'll<00:02:37.290> end<00:02:37.530> up<00:02:37.590> counting<00:02:38.040> in<00:02:38.160> a<00:02:38.310> little

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:38.519 
here I'll end up counting in a little

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:40.640 
here I'll end up counting in a little
bit<00:02:38.610> but<00:02:39.209> basically<00:02:39.510> you<00:02:40.290> know<00:02:40.410> I'll<00:02:40.590> just

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
bit but basically you know I'll just

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:42.350 
bit but basically you know I'll just
show<00:02:40.890> you<00:02:40.920> some<00:02:41.040> pictures<00:02:41.280> right<00:02:41.670> now<00:02:41.700> of<00:02:41.850> what

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
show you some pictures right now of what

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.020 
show you some pictures right now of what
I'm<00:02:42.450> gonna<00:02:42.569> make<00:02:42.840> they're<00:02:43.049> basically<00:02:43.530> uh

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
I'm gonna make they're basically uh

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:46.910 
I'm gonna make they're basically uh
puzzles<00:02:45.030> that<00:02:45.090> tray<00:02:45.390> from<00:02:45.450> have<00:02:45.810> made<00:02:46.019> and<00:02:46.290> I'm

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
puzzles that tray from have made and I'm

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.590 
puzzles that tray from have made and I'm
just<00:02:47.250> gonna<00:02:47.340> recreate<00:02:47.819> them<00:02:48.060> so<00:02:48.239> here<00:02:48.390> we<00:02:48.480> go

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
just gonna recreate them so here we go

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:52.039 
just gonna recreate them so here we go
okay<00:02:49.470> the<00:02:49.590> first<00:02:49.769> one<00:02:49.950> here<00:02:50.280> is<00:02:50.459> a<00:02:50.489> 1<00:02:50.820> by<00:02:51.030> 5<00:02:51.360> by<00:02:51.720> 5

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:52.049 
okay the first one here is a 1 by 5 by 5

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:53.750 
okay the first one here is a 1 by 5 by 5
and<00:02:52.440> I've<00:02:52.500> already<00:02:52.650> started<00:02:53.040> the<00:02:53.130> process<00:02:53.340> on

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
and I've already started the process on

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.009 
and I've already started the process on
this<00:02:53.970> one<00:02:54.120> I'm<00:02:54.299> having<00:02:54.570> a<00:02:54.720> little<00:02:54.900> bit<00:02:54.959> of

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:55.019 
this one I'm having a little bit of

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:56.870 
this one I'm having a little bit of
complications<00:02:55.799> but<00:02:56.310> I'm<00:02:56.430> sure<00:02:56.610> it'll<00:02:56.790> work

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
complications but I'm sure it'll work

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.880 
complications but I'm sure it'll work
out<00:02:57.209> in<00:02:57.360> the<00:02:57.480> end<00:02:57.660> and<00:02:57.780> it's<00:02:58.290> it's<00:02:58.739> a<00:02:58.799> little

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
out in the end and it's it's a little

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:00.560 
out in the end and it's it's a little
bit<00:02:59.040> different<00:02:59.610> you<00:02:59.670> know<00:02:59.820> I've<00:02:59.940> had<00:03:00.120> to<00:03:00.239> email

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:00.570 
bit different you know I've had to email

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:02.720 
bit different you know I've had to email
tray<00:03:00.930> from<00:03:01.019> a<00:03:01.170> few<00:03:01.380> times<00:03:01.620> to<00:03:01.829> ask<00:03:01.980> how<00:03:02.250> it's

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
tray from a few times to ask how it's

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:05.150 
tray from a few times to ask how it's
done<00:03:02.910> and<00:03:02.970> stuff<00:03:03.269> like<00:03:03.359> that<00:03:03.570> so<00:03:03.980> yeah<00:03:04.980> the

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
done and stuff like that so yeah the

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.849 
done and stuff like that so yeah the
next<00:03:05.280> one<00:03:05.489> is<00:03:05.670> a<00:03:05.820> 2<00:03:05.880> by<00:03:06.510> 5<00:03:06.810> by<00:03:07.019> 5<00:03:07.290> and<00:03:07.590> this<00:03:07.680> one's

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:07.859 
next one is a 2 by 5 by 5 and this one's

00:03:07.859 --> 00:03:10.099 
next one is a 2 by 5 by 5 and this one's
particularly<00:03:08.609> cool<00:03:08.820> I<00:03:09.120> think<00:03:09.480> it's<00:03:09.750> it's<00:03:09.930> not

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:10.109 
particularly cool I think it's it's not

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:12.229 
particularly cool I think it's it's not
one<00:03:10.410> that<00:03:10.560> you<00:03:10.620> see<00:03:10.920> very<00:03:11.160> often<00:03:11.730> at<00:03:11.850> all<00:03:11.970> and

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 
one that you see very often at all and

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:15.170 
one that you see very often at all and
this<00:03:12.329> takes<00:03:12.630> this<00:03:13.230> is<00:03:13.410> just<00:03:13.739> made<00:03:13.920> out<00:03:14.070> of<00:03:14.220> 1<00:03:14.459> 5

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
this takes this is just made out of 1 5

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:18.440 
this takes this is just made out of 1 5
by<00:03:15.510> 5<00:03:15.989> by<00:03:16.200> 4<00:03:16.260> and<00:03:16.799> then<00:03:17.340> the<00:03:17.609> next<00:03:17.940> one<00:03:18.030> here<00:03:18.269> is

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
by 5 by 4 and then the next one here is

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:23.810 
by 5 by 4 and then the next one here is
a<00:03:18.500> shape-shifting<00:03:19.500> 5<00:03:20.250> by<00:03:20.609> 5<00:03:20.970> by<00:03:21.570> 5<00:03:22.019> and<00:03:22.470> so<00:03:23.430> it's

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:23.820 
a shape-shifting 5 by 5 by 5 and so it's

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:26.180 
a shape-shifting 5 by 5 by 5 and so it's
weird<00:03:24.120> because<00:03:24.299> a<00:03:24.450> cuboid<00:03:24.900> usually<00:03:25.500> is<00:03:25.709> you

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
weird because a cuboid usually is you

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:28.340 
weird because a cuboid usually is you
know<00:03:26.310> it's<00:03:26.790> like<00:03:26.910> a<00:03:26.970> 5<00:03:27.540> by<00:03:27.690> 5<00:03:27.720> by<00:03:28.019> 4<00:03:28.320> or

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
know it's like a 5 by 5 by 4 or

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:29.750 
know it's like a 5 by 5 by 4 or
something<00:03:28.829> you<00:03:29.010> know<00:03:29.070> there's<00:03:29.280> different

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
something you know there's different

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.360 
something you know there's different
layers<00:03:30.180> in<00:03:30.390> there<00:03:30.750> but<00:03:30.930> a<00:03:31.079> 5<00:03:31.320> by<00:03:31.500> 5<00:03:31.650> by<00:03:31.799> 5<00:03:32.010> is<00:03:32.340> a

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
layers in there but a 5 by 5 by 5 is a

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:34.340 
layers in there but a 5 by 5 by 5 is a
cubic<00:03:32.760> puzzle<00:03:33.120> and<00:03:33.329> usually<00:03:33.930> you<00:03:34.140> know<00:03:34.230> they

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350 
cubic puzzle and usually you know they

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:36.199 
cubic puzzle and usually you know they
don't<00:03:34.500> shape-shift<00:03:35.280> but<00:03:35.489> in<00:03:35.579> this<00:03:35.730> case<00:03:35.940> it

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209 
don't shape-shift but in this case it

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:38.150 
don't shape-shift but in this case it
does<00:03:36.630> shape-shift<00:03:37.260> and<00:03:37.500> this<00:03:37.709> is<00:03:37.859> what<00:03:38.040> it

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
does shape-shift and this is what it

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:39.800 
does shape-shift and this is what it
looks<00:03:38.340> like<00:03:38.430> when<00:03:38.820> it's<00:03:38.970> all<00:03:39.090> shape-shifted

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
looks like when it's all shape-shifted

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:41.630 
looks like when it's all shape-shifted
night<00:03:39.989> I<00:03:40.170> can't<00:03:40.709> wait<00:03:40.980> to<00:03:41.100> play<00:03:41.220> with<00:03:41.400> this<00:03:41.489> I

night I can't wait to play with this I

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:44.090 
night I can't wait to play with this I
mean<00:03:41.870> it's<00:03:42.870> a<00:03:42.989> different<00:03:43.290> totally<00:03:43.799> different

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:44.100 
mean it's a different totally different

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:45.470 
mean it's a different totally different
kind<00:03:44.280> of<00:03:44.370> puzzle<00:03:44.700> to<00:03:44.880> play<00:03:45.030> with<00:03:45.209> you<00:03:45.390> know

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
kind of puzzle to play with you know

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.199 
kind of puzzle to play with you know
I've<00:03:45.630> never<00:03:45.900> seen<00:03:46.319> a<00:03:46.380> puzzle<00:03:46.829> like<00:03:46.950> this<00:03:46.980> and<00:03:47.519> I

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209 
I've never seen a puzzle like this and I

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:49.729 
I've never seen a puzzle like this and I
can't<00:03:48.540> I<00:03:48.690> personally<00:03:49.049> I<00:03:49.109> can't<00:03:49.319> wait<00:03:49.470> to<00:03:49.590> make
