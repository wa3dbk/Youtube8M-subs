00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
broke were alleviated it really does

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.060 
broke were alleviated it really does
work<00:00:23.430> it<00:00:24.140> drops<00:00:25.140> the<00:00:25.260> combined<00:00:25.680> chlorine

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
work it drops the combined chlorine

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.880 
work it drops the combined chlorine
level<00:00:26.400> way<00:00:27.090> down<00:00:27.390> it<00:00:27.720> was<00:00:27.900> night<00:00:28.140> and<00:00:28.170> day<00:00:28.349> when

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890

we<00:00:29.070> left<00:00:29.429> for<00:00:29.699> Florida<00:00:29.880> earlier<00:00:30.779> they

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
we left for Florida earlier they

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.560 
we left for Florida earlier they
installed<00:00:32.250> it<00:00:32.369> while<00:00:32.610> we<00:00:32.759> were<00:00:32.880> away<00:00:33.000> and<00:00:33.450> when

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
installed it while we were away and when

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.209 
installed it while we were away and when
we<00:00:33.660> got<00:00:33.840> back<00:00:33.899> it<00:00:34.620> was<00:00:34.680> a<00:00:34.770> totally<00:00:35.160> different

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
we got back it was a totally different

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.370 
we got back it was a totally different
environment<00:00:35.579> and<00:00:36.420> like<00:00:36.600> I<00:00:36.719> said<00:00:36.780> the<00:00:37.110> kids

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
environment and like I said the kids

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.260 
environment and like I said the kids
could<00:00:37.680> now<00:00:37.829> get<00:00:38.460> through<00:00:38.670> practice<00:00:39.090> which

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
could now get through practice which

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.229 
could now get through practice which
before<00:00:39.719> was<00:00:40.350> a<00:00:40.379> big<00:00:41.190> problem<00:00:41.489> for<00:00:41.760> a<00:00:42.030> lot<00:00:42.090> of

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
before was a big problem for a lot of

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:43.580 
before was a big problem for a lot of
them<00:00:42.480> a<00:00:42.510> lot<00:00:42.660> of<00:00:42.809> them<00:00:42.989> did<00:00:43.200> not<00:00:43.350> make<00:00:43.559> it

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
them a lot of them did not make it

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.709 
them a lot of them did not make it
through<00:00:43.920> and<00:00:44.160> now<00:00:44.610> they<00:00:44.789> could<00:00:45.000> and<00:00:45.270> in<00:00:45.629> the

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
through and now they could and in the

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:46.910 
through and now they could and in the
second<00:00:46.079> half<00:00:46.230> of<00:00:46.379> the<00:00:46.440> season

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
second half of the season

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.790 
second half of the season
that's<00:00:47.219> pretty<00:00:47.640> crucial<00:00:47.969> so<00:00:48.750> any<00:00:49.079> any<00:00:49.440> team

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
that's pretty crucial so any any team

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.040 
that's pretty crucial so any any team
that<00:00:50.129> would<00:00:50.730> be<00:00:50.789> having<00:00:51.300> these<00:00:51.420> problems<00:00:51.480> I

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
that would be having these problems I

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.139 
that would be having these problems I
would<00:00:52.230> tell<00:00:52.440> them<00:00:52.590> my<00:00:53.280> experience<00:00:53.789> as<00:00:53.910> a<00:00:53.940> coach

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
would tell them my experience as a coach

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.360 
would tell them my experience as a coach
you<00:00:54.539> got<00:00:55.079> to<00:00:55.230> install<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:55.680> system<00:00:56.070> because

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
you got to install the system because

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.580 
you got to install the system because
it's<00:00:57.120> it's<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:57.600> only<00:00:57.870> thing<00:00:58.109> that<00:00:58.260> helps<00:00:58.500> is

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
it's it's the only thing that helps is

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.170 
it's it's the only thing that helps is
there<00:00:58.710> everything<00:00:58.920> we<00:00:59.219> tried<00:00:59.520> to<00:00:59.640> do<00:00:59.820> it<00:01:00.059> was

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
there everything we tried to do it was

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.779 
there everything we tried to do it was
the<00:01:00.210> only<00:01:00.480> thing<00:01:00.780> that<00:01:00.840> really<00:01:01.230> had<00:01:01.949> that<00:01:02.520> big

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
the only thing that really had that big

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.329 
the only thing that really had that big
of<00:01:02.910> an<00:01:03.030> impact<00:01:03.210> that<00:01:03.899> we<00:01:04.589> haven't<00:01:04.949> had<00:01:05.100> any

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
of an impact that we haven't had any

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:06.980 
of an impact that we haven't had any
problems<00:01:05.760> anymore<00:01:05.970> with<00:01:06.270> the<00:01:06.420> kids<00:01:06.659> in<00:01:06.900> the

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
anything like that so like I said it was

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.530 
anything like that so like I said it was
a<00:01:22.560> very<00:01:22.890> dramatic<00:01:23.610> change

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
a very dramatic change

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.150 
a very dramatic change
to<00:01:24.750> be<00:01:24.900> a<00:01:24.930> little<00:01:25.170> bit<00:01:25.290> longer<00:01:25.500> but<00:01:25.830> it<00:01:25.980> was

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:26.160 
to be a little bit longer but it was

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:29.300 
to be a little bit longer but it was
very<00:01:26.820> quickly<00:01:27.090> receiving<00:01:27.750> effects<00:01:28.130> it<00:01:29.130> had

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
very quickly receiving effects it had

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:30.920 
very quickly receiving effects it had
proved<00:01:30.240> it<00:01:30.360> immensely

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
proved it immensely

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.730 
proved it immensely
I<00:01:31.530> could<00:01:32.250> not<00:01:32.430> keep<00:01:32.640> anything<00:01:33.440> the<00:01:34.440> combined

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
I could not keep anything the combined

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.280 
I could not keep anything the combined
chlorines<00:01:35.190> down<00:01:35.870> whatsoever<00:01:36.870> they<00:01:37.110> would

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
chlorines down whatsoever they would

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.450 
chlorines down whatsoever they would
walk<00:01:37.470> to<00:01:37.770> 2.0<00:01:38.990> and<00:01:39.990> with<00:01:40.470> the<00:01:40.590> spectra<00:01:40.950> like<00:01:41.160> it

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
walk to 2.0 and with the spectra like it

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.030 
walk to 2.0 and with the spectra like it
they<00:01:42.150> seemed<00:01:42.780> to<00:01:43.020> hover<00:01:43.200> it<00:01:43.470> around<00:01:43.680> point

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
they seemed to hover it around point

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.780 
they seemed to hover it around point
five<00:01:44.780> chloramine<00:01:45.780> odor<00:01:45.960> has<00:01:46.430> virtually<00:01:47.430> gone

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
five chloramine odor has virtually gone

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.810 
five chloramine odor has virtually gone
away<00:01:48.030> I<00:01:48.680> really<00:01:49.680> did<00:01:49.920> notice<00:01:50.280> a<00:01:50.370> difference

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
away I really did notice a difference

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.840 
away I really did notice a difference
because<00:01:51.240> I<00:01:51.630> wasn't

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
because I wasn't

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.100 
because I wasn't
I<00:01:54.080> just<00:01:55.080> naturally<00:01:55.619> felt<00:01:56.159> better

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:57.110 
I just naturally felt better

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:00.190 
I just naturally felt better
