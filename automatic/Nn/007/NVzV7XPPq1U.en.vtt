for<00:00:23.300> no<00:00:23.510> reason<00:00:28.179> if<00:00:29.179> we<00:00:29.240> could<00:00:29.689> do<00:00:29.840> something

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:30.140 
for no reason if we could do something

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:35.410 
for no reason if we could do something
to<00:00:30.590> stop<00:00:31.000> or<00:00:32.000> in<00:00:32.390> fact<00:00:32.930> reduce<00:00:33.640> these<00:00:34.640> things<00:00:35.060> I

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:35.420 
to stop or in fact reduce these things I

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:38.800 
to stop or in fact reduce these things I
think<00:00:35.930> it<00:00:36.080> will<00:00:36.290> bring<00:00:36.920> a<00:00:37.280> greater<00:00:37.820> workforce

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:38.810 
think it will bring a greater workforce

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:40.480 
think it will bring a greater workforce
in<00:00:39.080> the<00:00:39.230> future<00:00:39.590> for<00:00:39.740> these<00:00:39.920> countries<00:00:40.310> which

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:40.490 
in the future for these countries which

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:42.280 
in the future for these countries which
will<00:00:40.670> be<00:00:40.880> beneficial<00:00:41.090> we're<00:00:41.750> having<00:00:41.990> a<00:00:42.080> huge

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:42.290 
will be beneficial we're having a huge

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:44.410 
will be beneficial we're having a huge
problem<00:00:42.500> in<00:00:42.830> Mexico<00:00:43.010> right<00:00:43.400> now<00:00:43.520> with<00:00:43.820> the

problem in Mexico right now with the
drug<00:00:44.600> cartels<00:00:44.960> and<00:00:45.170> that's<00:00:45.380> starting<00:00:45.890> to

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:45.980 
drug cartels and that's starting to

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:53.050 
drug cartels and that's starting to
sweep<00:00:46.220> into<00:00:46.520> the<00:00:46.610> United<00:00:46.880> States<00:00:51.760> I'm<00:00:52.760> trying

to<00:00:53.120> address<00:00:53.300> that<00:00:53.630> major<00:00:54.050> problem<00:00:54.590> by

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:54.710 
to address that major problem by

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:56.260 
to address that major problem by
studying<00:00:55.070> other<00:00:55.280> police<00:00:55.580> forces<00:00:55.610> in<00:00:56.060> Latin

America and see what we can learn from

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:59.620 
America and see what we can learn from
them<00:00:57.830> and<00:00:58.040> apply<00:00:58.610> them<00:00:58.790> to<00:00:58.820> Mexico<00:00:59.330> and<00:00:59.510> other

them and apply them to Mexico and other
countries<00:00:59.720> that<00:01:00.140> are<00:01:00.230> suffering<00:01:00.440> every<00:01:01.430> 15

monitor and treat the brain diseases

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.900 
monitor and treat the brain diseases
without<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.560> need<00:01:22.740> for<00:01:22.770> repeated<00:01:23.220> surgeries

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:23.910 
without the need for repeated surgeries

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:26.360 
without the need for repeated surgeries
over<00:01:24.540> 1<00:01:24.750> billion<00:01:24.990> people<00:01:25.260> worldwide<00:01:25.890> like

access to clean water these deaths and
these<00:01:33.090> illnesses<00:01:33.300> are<00:01:33.840> very<00:01:34.050> preventable<00:01:34.380> so

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
these illnesses are very preventable so

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.790 
these illnesses are very preventable so
by<00:01:35.700> my<00:01:36.240> research<00:01:36.600> here<00:01:36.840> at<00:01:36.960> UCR<00:01:37.230> I<00:01:37.380> hope<00:01:37.650> to

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:37.800 
by my research here at UCR I hope to

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.160 
by my research here at UCR I hope to
provide<00:01:38.100> new<00:01:38.760> technological<00:01:39.360> and<00:01:40.020> maybe

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
provide new technological and maybe

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.560 
provide new technological and maybe
holistic<00:01:40.620> solutions<00:01:41.130> to<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:41.760> water<00:01:42.120> issues

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
holistic solutions to the water issues

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.450 
holistic solutions to the water issues
not<00:01:43.080> only<00:01:43.290> domestically<00:01:43.710> but<00:01:43.830> especially

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
not only domestically but especially

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.000 
not only domestically but especially
abroad<00:01:44.640> during<00:01:45.450> the<00:01:45.690> late<00:01:45.870> 19th<00:01:46.230> century<00:01:46.350> a

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:47.010 
abroad during the late 19th century a

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:49.970 
abroad during the late 19th century a
growing<00:01:47.460> group<00:01:47.580> of<00:01:47.820> Jewish<00:01:48.420> women<00:01:48.780> writers<00:01:48.990> in

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:49.980 
growing group of Jewish women writers in

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:53.990 
growing group of Jewish women writers in
England<00:01:50.490> were<00:01:51.150> influencing<00:01:52.110> and<00:01:52.970> shaping<00:01:53.970> a

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
England were influencing and shaping a

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:01.240 
England were influencing and shaping a
variety<00:01:54.780> of<00:01:54.810> political<00:01:55.020> spheres<00:01:55.620> and<00:01:55.860> debates

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:01.250 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.790 

and<00:02:02.250> I<00:02:02.370> look<00:02:02.550> at<00:02:02.700> how<00:02:02.900> they<00:02:03.900> influence<00:02:04.410> things

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:04.800 
and I look at how they influence things

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:06.500 
and I look at how they influence things
like<00:02:05.070> women's<00:02:05.550> suffrage<00:02:06.030> all<00:02:06.300> the<00:02:06.420> way

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:06.510 
like women's suffrage all the way

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:09.260 
like women's suffrage all the way
through<00:02:06.960> to<00:02:07.200> Jewish<00:02:07.530> nationalism<00:02:08.130> and<00:02:08.940> the

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
through to Jewish nationalism and the

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.200 
through to Jewish nationalism and the
emerging<00:02:09.660> Zionist<00:02:10.560> movement<00:02:11.210> currently

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:12.210 
emerging Zionist movement currently

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:14.240 
emerging Zionist movement currently
there's<00:02:12.420> not<00:02:12.630> a<00:02:12.660> diagnostic<00:02:13.110> tool<00:02:13.710> which<00:02:13.950> can

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
there's not a diagnostic tool which can

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:15.830 
there's not a diagnostic tool which can
distinguish<00:02:14.670> between<00:02:14.730> bacterial<00:02:15.570> and<00:02:15.810> viral

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
distinguish between bacterial and viral

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:21.980 
distinguish between bacterial and viral
infections

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:25.310 

and<00:02:22.080> so<00:02:22.950> this<00:02:23.130> is<00:02:23.370> a<00:02:23.670> good<00:02:24.540> area<00:02:24.750> of<00:02:24.960> research

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 
and so this is a good area of research

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:28.690 
and so this is a good area of research
because<00:02:25.860> it'll<00:02:26.340> decrease<00:02:26.880> the<00:02:27.540> amount<00:02:28.050> of

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
because it'll decrease the amount of

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.060 
because it'll decrease the amount of
antibiotic<00:02:29.700> resistance<00:02:30.330> that<00:02:31.290> occurs<00:02:31.710> and

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.070 
antibiotic resistance that occurs and

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:35.330 
antibiotic resistance that occurs and
also<00:02:32.880> you<00:02:33.630> get<00:02:33.780> the<00:02:33.960> proper<00:02:34.320> treatment<00:02:34.620> in<00:02:35.130> a

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
also you get the proper treatment in a

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.460 
also you get the proper treatment in a
quicker<00:02:35.640> time<00:02:35.940> my<00:02:36.600> interest<00:02:37.050> in<00:02:37.290> social

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
quicker time my interest in social

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.490 
quicker time my interest in social
inequality<00:02:38.250> grew<00:02:38.790> out<00:02:39.090> of<00:02:39.150> my<00:02:39.720> experiences<00:02:40.380> in

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
inequality grew out of my experiences in

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:49.040 
inequality grew out of my experiences in
