00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
it's collapsible which is great because

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.170 
it's collapsible which is great because
you<00:00:55.649> cuts<00:00:55.920> down<00:00:56.039> a<00:00:56.100> size<00:00:56.370> when<00:00:56.670> moving<00:00:56.879> around

which<00:00:57.600> is<00:00:57.750> really<00:00:57.989> important<00:00:58.260> for<00:00:58.350> Micro<00:00:58.620> Four

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
which is really important for Micro Four

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.799 
which is really important for Micro Four
Thirds<00:00:58.829> since<00:00:59.460> the<00:00:59.670> one<00:01:00.329> of<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.449> main<00:01:00.539> selling

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809

points<00:01:01.109> at<00:01:01.170> this<00:01:01.320> standard<00:01:01.680> is<00:01:01.890> that<00:01:01.920> it's<00:01:02.250> so

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
points at this standard is that it's so

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.359 
points at this standard is that it's so
small<00:01:02.399> so<00:01:02.910> the<00:01:03.840> issue<00:01:04.019> with<00:01:04.260> this<00:01:04.439> is<00:01:04.680> that<00:01:04.949> the

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
small so the issue with this is that the

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.789 
small so the issue with this is that the
there's<00:01:05.939> a<00:01:05.970> lot<00:01:06.090> of<00:01:06.210> movement<00:01:06.390> here<00:01:06.930> and<00:01:07.020> the

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
there's a lot of movement here and the

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.600 
there's a lot of movement here and the
focusing<00:01:08.340> is<00:01:09.229> external<00:01:10.229> so<00:01:10.560> when<00:01:11.340> you're

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
focusing is external so when you're

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.760 
focusing is external so when you're
focusing<00:01:12.030> when<00:01:12.570> shooting<00:01:12.780> video<00:01:13.020> you<00:01:13.650> could

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
focusing when shooting video you could

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.350 
focusing when shooting video you could
hear<00:01:14.070> this<00:01:14.220> grinding<00:01:14.820> a<00:01:14.939> little<00:01:15.119> bit<00:01:16.220> so<00:01:17.360> yeah

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
hear this grinding a little bit so yeah

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.120 
hear this grinding a little bit so yeah
just<00:01:18.689> keep<00:01:18.840> that<00:01:18.960> in<00:01:19.110> mind<00:01:19.290> for<00:01:19.530> later<00:01:19.890> in<00:01:20.040> the

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
just keep that in mind for later in the
