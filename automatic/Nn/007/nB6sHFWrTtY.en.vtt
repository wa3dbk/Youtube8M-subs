00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:54.259 

I<00:03:51.409> think<00:03:52.409> you<00:03:52.499> can<00:03:52.650> see<00:03:52.859> the<00:03:53.010> top<00:03:53.219> of<00:03:53.430> my<00:03:53.609> my

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:54.269 
I think you can see the top of my my

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:59.479 
I think you can see the top of my my
thread<00:03:55.730> in<00:03:56.730> that<00:03:57.109> in<00:03:58.109> that<00:03:58.319> picture<00:03:58.950> there<00:03:59.280> and

00:03:59.479 --> 00:03:59.489 
thread in that in that picture there and

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:03.170 
thread in that in that picture there and
as<00:04:00.180> I<00:04:00.799> traverse<00:04:01.799> the<00:04:02.069> thread<00:04:02.340> chaser<00:04:02.760> towards

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
as I traverse the thread chaser towards

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.929 
as I traverse the thread chaser towards
that<00:04:03.389> shoulder<00:04:03.989> the<00:04:04.859> recess<00:04:05.310> allows<00:04:05.609> me<00:04:05.849> to

00:04:05.929 --> 00:04:05.939 
that shoulder the recess allows me to

00:04:05.939 --> 00:04:08.420 
that shoulder the recess allows me to
pull<00:04:06.150> my<00:04:06.269> thread<00:04:06.450> chaser<00:04:06.959> out<00:04:07.109> so<00:04:07.590> we'll<00:04:08.219> take

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:08.430 
pull my thread chaser out so we'll take

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:13.280 
pull my thread chaser out so we'll take
a<00:04:08.489> look<00:04:08.730> and<00:04:08.939> see<00:04:09.120> if<00:04:09.269> if<00:04:09.900> we're<00:04:10.170> close<00:04:12.290> it's

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.290 
a look and see if if we're close it's

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:17.719 
a look and see if if we're close it's
just<00:04:13.409> just<00:04:14.280> starting<00:04:14.790> to<00:04:15.590> begin<00:04:16.590> to<00:04:16.709> thread<00:04:17.519> on

just just starting to begin to thread on
there<00:04:17.970> I<00:04:18.000> need<00:04:18.209> to<00:04:18.239> take<00:04:18.419> a<00:04:18.449> little<00:04:18.690> bit<00:04:18.870> of

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:18.959 
there I need to take a little bit of

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:20.749 
there I need to take a little bit of
that<00:04:19.049> off<00:04:19.109> at<00:04:19.859> this<00:04:20.039> time<00:04:20.099> what<00:04:20.459> I'm<00:04:20.549> going<00:04:20.699> to

do is I'm going to take my tenon and
remove<00:04:23.910> it<00:04:24.090> because<00:04:24.300> they<00:04:25.229> don't<00:04:25.380> really<00:04:25.530> need

remove it because they don't really need

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:27.580 
remove it because they don't really need
that<00:04:25.830> anymore

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:27.590 
that anymore

that anymore
that<00:04:28.590> tenon<00:04:29.099> shows<00:04:29.759> me<00:04:30.000> the<00:04:30.180> depth<00:04:30.449> of<00:04:30.720> my<00:04:30.900> mail

that relief area from my thread chaser

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:08.880 
that relief area from my thread chaser
255<00:05:06.780> and<00:05:07.780> I<00:05:07.870> need<00:05:08.050> to<00:05:08.140> come<00:05:08.290> back<00:05:08.440> out<00:05:08.650> here<00:05:08.710> a

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:08.890 
255 and I need to come back out here a

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:25.400 
255 and I need to come back out here a
little<00:05:09.070> bit<00:05:09.190> more<00:05:09.400> of<00:05:09.490> an<00:05:09.580> angle<00:05:09.910> to<00:05:09.940> start

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:25.410 

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:40.290 

let's<00:05:26.410> try<00:05:26.650> that

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:40.300 

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:46.269 

still<00:05:41.300> just<00:05:41.479> a<00:05:41.629> little<00:05:41.869> tight<00:05:44.349> now<00:05:45.349> the<00:05:45.949> reason

00:05:46.269 --> 00:05:46.279 
still just a little tight now the reason

00:05:46.279 --> 00:05:48.699 
still just a little tight now the reason
I'm<00:05:46.399> taking<00:05:46.610> a<00:05:47.119> little<00:05:47.989> bit<00:05:48.139> off<00:05:48.259> the<00:05:48.469> top<00:05:48.679> of

00:05:48.699 --> 00:05:48.709 
I'm taking a little bit off the top of

00:05:48.709 --> 00:05:50.829 
I'm taking a little bit off the top of
these<00:05:48.979> male<00:05:49.789> threads<00:05:50.269> and<00:05:50.449> taking<00:05:50.749> the

00:05:50.829 --> 00:05:50.839 
these male threads and taking the

00:05:50.839 --> 00:05:53.559 
these male threads and taking the
highpoint<00:05:51.289> off<00:05:51.529> if<00:05:52.489> you<00:05:52.759> try<00:05:52.969> to<00:05:53.029> do<00:05:53.239> that<00:05:53.389> with

00:05:53.559 --> 00:05:53.569 
highpoint off if you try to do that with

00:05:53.569 --> 00:05:55.629 
highpoint off if you try to do that with
a<00:05:53.599> thread<00:05:53.929> chaser<00:05:54.409> your<00:05:54.589> your<00:05:55.099> threads<00:05:55.459> would

00:05:55.629 --> 00:05:55.639 
a thread chaser your your threads would

00:05:55.639 --> 00:05:56.320 
a thread chaser your your threads would
crumble

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:56.330 
crumble

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:58.329 
crumble
so<00:05:56.449> I'm<00:05:56.569> taking<00:05:56.719> just<00:05:57.139> the<00:05:57.259> very<00:05:57.589> very<00:05:57.860> tip<00:05:58.189> of

00:05:58.329 --> 00:05:58.339 
so I'm taking just the very very tip of

00:05:58.339 --> 00:06:03.579 
so I'm taking just the very very tip of
that<00:05:58.959> carry<00:05:59.959> off<00:06:01.899> and<00:06:02.899> this<00:06:02.989> is<00:06:03.169> a<00:06:03.229> little<00:06:03.469> bit

00:06:03.579 --> 00:06:03.589 
that carry off and this is a little bit

00:06:03.589 --> 00:06:05.439 
that carry off and this is a little bit
of<00:06:03.679> guesswork<00:06:04.009> at<00:06:04.249> this<00:06:04.429> point<00:06:04.729> you<00:06:05.239> need<00:06:05.389> to

00:06:05.439 --> 00:06:05.449 
of guesswork at this point you need to

00:06:05.449 --> 00:06:07.839 
of guesswork at this point you need to
make<00:06:05.569> sure<00:06:05.839> you<00:06:06.019> have<00:06:06.139> a<00:06:06.169> chamfer<00:06:06.559> there<00:06:06.979> for

00:06:07.839 --> 00:06:07.849 
make sure you have a chamfer there for

00:06:07.849 --> 00:06:17.370 
make sure you have a chamfer there for
your<00:06:07.969> thread<00:06:08.269> chase<00:06:08.509> or<00:06:08.749> two<00:06:08.959> to<00:06:09.830> begin

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:17.380 

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:22.150 

2:55<00:06:18.820> if<00:06:19.820> you<00:06:20.000> chase<00:06:20.270> threads<00:06:20.690> a<00:06:20.870> to<00:06:21.160> slowest

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:22.160 
2:55 if you chase threads a to slowest

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:24.189 
2:55 if you chase threads a to slowest
speed<00:06:22.510> you'll<00:06:23.510> get<00:06:23.660> what's<00:06:23.870> called<00:06:24.050> the

00:06:24.189 --> 00:06:24.199 
speed you'll get what's called the

00:06:24.199 --> 00:06:27.490 
speed you'll get what's called the
drunken<00:06:24.470> thread<00:06:24.949> and<00:06:25.220> if<00:06:25.400> if<00:06:26.240> you<00:06:26.330> do<00:06:26.630> that<00:06:26.810> the

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:27.500 
drunken thread and if if you do that the

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:53.940 
drunken thread and if if you do that the
thread<00:06:27.800> simply<00:06:28.220> won't<00:06:28.370> work

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:53.950 

00:06:53.950 --> 00:07:01.020 

there<00:06:54.580> we<00:06:54.730> have<00:06:54.940> it

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:01.030 

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:03.080 

you

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:03.090 
you

00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:05.540 
you
it's<00:07:03.660> a<00:07:03.720> simple<00:07:04.080> process<00:07:04.620> you<00:07:05.190> don't<00:07:05.400> really

00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:05.550 
it's a simple process you don't really

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:08.300 
it's a simple process you don't really
need<00:07:05.840> calipers<00:07:06.840> or<00:07:07.170> any<00:07:07.740> other<00:07:07.950> kind<00:07:08.220> of
