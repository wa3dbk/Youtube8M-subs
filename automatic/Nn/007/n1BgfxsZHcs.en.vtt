00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:07.180
 taken a shortcoming 

00:00:08.619 --> 00:00:11.089
 Werner my name has resigned 

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:15.400
 I'm glad to meet you, we do not know each other physically 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:19.369
 but we encourage the Mainzer manager to eat 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:23.020
 for example the interest in land 

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:27.830
 God is Hans Willi quality and if they lie about bonds with long 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:28.470
 Curls 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.300
 in meditation on this 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.920
 via this website to watch this video now then we share that too 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:40.440
 Interest in angels we believe in God to the spiritual world 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:45.690
 we are currently in a fantastic time in 2010 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:47.610
 a 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.740
 wonderful transformation takes place while in the hearts of the people 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:58.920
 More and more people are searching for their inner truth 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.670
 the search for their sudden origins we all have 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.190
 that our origin in the basket yes 

00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:09.730
 goes into detail 

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:14.940
 a Seeger individual personal 3 cents 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:17.610
 looking for a come to us 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:18.979
 Vicen's core 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:21.330
 looking for 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.570
 Pop songs and jumped years 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:27.100
 what you see here 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:28.550
 that's not me 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:32.500
 they see here in shopping they need to hear my voice 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:38.220
 we have a body we have got in we have thought holders 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.430
 these are 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:42.490
 not we could often thank you 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:44.500
 not even our own thoughts 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:50.229
 We have heard something read and beside that the other as truth 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:55.530
 it is only part of the reality of what works on us 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.990
 the truth is always expected 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:07.020
 The reality of the word reality comes from the ancient Greek prepaid customer 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.700
 Reporting and 3 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:09.950
 piercingly 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:10.919
 everything so 

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:13.919
 the truth God is the all pervades 

00:02:13.919 --> 00:02:15.879
 what we see here is the 

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:22.029
 phenomenal reality of what but the senses affect us 

00:02:22.029 --> 00:02:26.099
 Reflection and one of our senses are pretty limited yes 

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:29.229
 I assume 

00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:30.429
 I think 

00:02:30.429 --> 00:02:31.659
 I am yes 

00:02:31.659 --> 00:02:33.949
 quite sure many of them 

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:39.099
 most of them are some of them, however one is the St 

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:41.689
 when working with relative concepts 

00:02:41.689 --> 00:02:47.359
 have a much finer scene than me and no angel perceive 

00:02:47.359 --> 00:02:50.359
 Nature lovers and so on 

00:02:53.659 --> 00:02:55.659
 our 

00:02:55.659 --> 00:02:58.659
 Identity the SPD is doing 

00:02:59.279 --> 00:03:01.349
 Guest is Dr 

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:05.760
 v here are good and otherwise he would have a market Mar. 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:10.319
 Burglary in Egyptian SPD coach Sparkle 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:14.370
 a crow knows the baby dead similar to God's energies 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:17.440
 Gold has infinite energies 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:19.379
 material energies 

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:22.579
 with whom he made this material world but 

00:03:23.189 --> 00:03:28.639
 There are behind this fake inventions accepting what affects us 

00:03:28.639 --> 00:03:30.089
 also 

00:03:30.089 --> 00:03:31.180
 reality 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:36.900
 The spiritual world God is something we do not do with our Rogan senses 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.459
 but only 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:40.640
 be with us 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:42.389
 you 

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:44.219
 we have a body 

00:03:44.219 --> 00:03:46.139
 he is on loan 

00:03:46.139 --> 00:03:48.209
 the Menten expand too 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:51.569
 this planet is composed 

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:54.849
 the planet the earth is a blue planet 

00:03:54.849 --> 00:04:00.229
 it consists mostly of water and that is how our body is made 

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:03.509
 mostly from water 

00:04:03.509 --> 00:04:05.579
 the hamburger and sisters 

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:08.389
 look around in the background 

00:04:08.389 --> 00:04:13.089
 we have too many sisters and brothers in the beast and the plants 

00:04:13.089 --> 00:04:15.689
 basket 

00:04:15.689 --> 00:04:17.879
 that is a tough one 

00:04:17.879 --> 00:04:19.769
 it may not be one of the 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:22.860
 Challenges in our lives 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:25.300
 stop judging 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:26.849
 the people 

00:04:26.849 --> 00:04:30.050
 to judge the living things by their bodies 

00:04:31.009 --> 00:04:35.419
 because somebody has a dark one bright one big one small one 

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:36.740
 one 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:39.449
 fast or slow body 

00:04:39.449 --> 00:04:42.449
 that's like private cars 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:46.450
 You may find it sometimes, too 

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:50.449
 somebody has another car a faster car a bigger car 

00:04:50.449 --> 00:04:54.250
 and so on the court saw Frank crack 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:56.939
 to all the many 

00:04:56.939 --> 00:04:59.219
 variations 

00:04:59.219 --> 00:05:00.050
 God 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:02.550
 he creates 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:04.960
 Jacques are different here 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:06.279
 in the hands 

00:05:06.279 --> 00:05:08.280
 that's Beijing too 

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:11.599
 and the plants Georg 

00:05:11.599 --> 00:05:14.879
 are among the smallest in the world 

00:05:14.879 --> 00:05:17.499
 Bremen in a free practice 

00:05:17.499 --> 00:05:19.900
 Reality in a fine can 

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:21.170
 dimensions 

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:24.139
 and who's coming we'll hit Ralf Stegner 

00:05:24.139 --> 00:05:25.650
 Head coach 

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:28.650
 That's what you do about food, for example 

00:05:29.379 --> 00:05:31.460
 to eat vegetarian food 

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:34.009
 Got 180 things 

00:05:34.009 --> 00:05:37.080
 Steinacher 

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:39.860
 you can also get the finer dimension 

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:41.930
 rank 

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:44.150
 absolutely correct 

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:45.699
 can 

00:05:45.699 --> 00:05:48.589
 greeting 

00:05:48.589 --> 00:05:51.009
 Get to know the traveling attendant of the association 

00:05:51.009 --> 00:05:53.240
 I wish him all the best 

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:56.379
 fly on all fours 

00:05:56.379 --> 00:05:58.610
 to God 

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:01.610
 as a cult here breaks the PRI 

00:06:02.919 --> 00:06:06.180
 Mail 

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:07.909
 for the lack 

00:06:07.909 --> 00:06:09.959
 was in the morning
