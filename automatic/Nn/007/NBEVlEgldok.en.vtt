00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
garden in my head and once I was tired

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.440 
garden in my head and once I was tired
of<00:00:41.160> them<00:00:41.309> being<00:00:41.489> long<00:00:41.760> once<00:00:42.059> I<00:00:42.180> started

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
of them being long once I started

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:43.850 
of them being long once I started
working<00:00:42.629> out<00:00:42.809> with<00:00:42.989> Carmen<00:00:43.320> I<00:00:43.379> cooked<00:00:43.680> them

working out with Carmen I cooked them

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.340 
working out with Carmen I cooked them
short<00:00:44.219> and<00:00:44.309> burned<00:00:44.700> the<00:00:44.910> ends<00:00:45.420> so<00:00:45.539> I<00:00:46.140> think

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
short and burned the ends so I think

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.080 
short and burned the ends so I think
next<00:00:46.800> time<00:00:47.070> I<00:00:47.190> put<00:00:47.370> these<00:00:47.520> in<00:00:47.579> I'm<00:00:47.910> actually

gonna<00:00:48.420> have<00:00:48.719> them<00:00:49.140> at<00:00:49.530> this<00:00:50.100> length<00:00:50.460> because<00:00:50.820> I

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
gonna have them at this length because I

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.990

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.660 
sense to you at all it made
and<00:02:11.430> to<00:02:11.849> me<00:02:12.030> because<00:02:12.629> I<00:02:12.660> couldn't<00:02:13.379> get<00:02:13.739> it<00:02:13.950> like

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
and to me because I couldn't get it like

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.610 
and to me because I couldn't get it like
I<00:02:14.910> really<00:02:15.390> wanted<00:02:15.720> to<00:02:15.870> give<00:02:16.050> up<00:02:16.260> but<00:02:16.440> I<00:02:16.500> was

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
I really wanted to give up but I was

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.229 
I really wanted to give up but I was
like<00:02:16.769> halfway<00:02:17.010> through<00:02:17.190> my<00:02:17.459> head<00:02:17.700> so<00:02:18.060> I<00:02:18.120> was

00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:18.239 
like halfway through my head so I was

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:20.210 
like halfway through my head so I was
like<00:02:18.360> I<00:02:18.510> might<00:02:18.810> as<00:02:18.989> well<00:02:19.019> keep<00:02:19.590> going

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
like I might as well keep going

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.160 
like I might as well keep going
