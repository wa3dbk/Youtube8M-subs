00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.770

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.930

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.539
 spirit that just wanted to send greetings 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.700
 to my editors who are from the country and who 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.040
 watch my videos congratulations 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.170
 today as clearly says the 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.320
 I will be teaching you to be 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.210
 a cool day a costume of mario bros 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.010
 for halloween and I feel like a disguise 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.230
 like that perfect because it 's like 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.239
 for last minute for those people 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.000
 that we are going to look for a costume and there is no 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.680
 of his size and they took it all for 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.120
 another time to buy one or 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.829
 they just did not like to do their 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.809
 money buying some costumes that are 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.190
 very expensive then I made this declared and 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.620
 I wanted to share it because it's super 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.630
 easy this beautiful but if you are 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:08.250
 little 

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:10.650
 of young age but if you are 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.750
 less than me and so they can simply 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.180
 use a red shirt that is more 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.920
 long and a few longer soles or ones 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.900
 pants and he will give them the same 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.820
 result is to look like a disguise of 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:24.330
 mario bros equal and if they are adults 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.950
 great older boys because 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.420
 can do and combine it as it is 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.610
 paste art remember that halloween is 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.590
 to have fun to be creative and 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:35.079
 eat lots of sweets 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:36.850
 so I hope you like it and we're going to 

00:01:35.079 --> 00:01:39.429
 start to create this disguise 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:42.189
 we will need a red shirt shorts 

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:44.920
 black or dark blue a red cap a 

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:48.569
 white shirt a black shirt and a 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.569
 marker be red or black 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:54.640
 let's start by making a circle in 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:57.160
 the white shirt that is not very big 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:02:00.180
 not very small that is medium or depends 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:00.180
 of the cap they use 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:12.310
 then we will cut it and cut the 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:12.310
 little pieces that are uneven 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:18.680
 and we will do it with the letter m m of medium 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:20.810
 in the center of the circle you have to 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.610
 to stay more or less like this they can also 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:24.800
 draw it among the red cut it out and 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:26.840
 paste it in the white circle but I the 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:30.010
 I did with a red marker or they can do it 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:32.819
 with black marker is as they prefer 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.819
 and 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:39.100
 and I forgot to mention that also 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:41.170
 we will need glue and we will glue the 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:43.120
 mario logo on the cap detail 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:45.130
 important put a lot of glue and not 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.600
 use it until it dries I did 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:50.370
 the opposite and then it started to me 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:50.370
 take off so do not make my mistake 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:55.950
 and we ended up with mario's cap 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:02.470
 in the black shirt we will cut four 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:04.150
 two strips on each side of the shoulder because 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:06.220
 that part where you see the shoulder is more 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:07.630
 long that the part where you see the neck and 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:10.830
 the strips do not have to be very 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:10.830
 thick or very thin 

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:22.240
 then we will stick them together creating two strips 

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:22.240
 longer 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:33.560
 now let's complete the disguise as 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.930
 you can see my shirt is simple without 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:39.330
 drawings or letters or anything and it's a tone 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:41.850
 of red similar to mario's outfit 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:43.830
 and down I have some black fabric shorts 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:45.960
 which are highways since my shirt 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:47.970
 scrotum can also use shorts 

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:50.400
 dark blue 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:52.020
 from the part where we hit the strips that 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.970
 is the part that we will put on the shoulder and 

00:03:52.020 --> 00:04:00.960
 thus being the same length of back and 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:04:02.430
 ahead they will accommodate them well and a 

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:05.250
 Once they are in place they can be 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:07.230
 stick with a sewing glue gun 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:10.310
 or use of these hooks to 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:10.310
 hold them in place 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:18.790
 You can also put buttons 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:21.160
 reds are black and can get 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:23.050
 white gloves those are already details 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.699
 extras that you can add if you want 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:28.350
 I wanted it to be quick and easy 

00:04:24.699 --> 00:04:28.350
 so I kept the basics 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:39.790
 for shoes can use those who want 

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:41.950
 as long as they are black and if they are going to 

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:45.090
 a party and they're going to wear heels that are 

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:47.400
 of platform since they are more comfortable 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:49.860
 As you can see they can put on shorts 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:52.020
 skirts or pants but always and 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:53.940
 When they are made of cloth they can also 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:55.979
 get a mustache if you want or can 

00:04:53.940 --> 00:05:01.190
 make luigi by changing everything red by 

00:04:55.979 --> 00:05:01.190
 green and this full look of mario bros 

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:05.640
 obviously you can make up 

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:08.120
 prefer this was the makeup that I 

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:08.120

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:14.510
