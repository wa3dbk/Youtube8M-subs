in size so you see we're quite leveling

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:59.050 
in size so you see we're quite leveling
up<00:04:49.160> really<00:04:49.610> fast<00:04:49.760> and<00:04:54.880> Lizzy's<00:04:56.230> he<00:04:57.230> kills<00:04:58.060> and

so they're able to spend ages lived in
upland<00:05:08.340> but<00:05:08.460> you<00:05:08.520> could<00:05:08.760> do<00:05:08.880> that<00:05:10.040> just<00:05:11.040> belong

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:11.550 
upland but you could do that just belong

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:13.340 
upland but you could do that just belong
to<00:05:12.389> handle<00:05:12.660> weapons<00:05:12.780> are<00:05:13.050> gonna<00:05:13.170> take

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:15.620 
obviously longer said slower swing in

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:17.990 
obviously longer said slower swing in
that<00:05:16.620> go<00:05:16.800> pretty<00:05:17.040> be<00:05:17.160> the<00:05:17.250> fastest<00:05:17.730> to<00:05:17.790> their

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:18.000 
that go pretty be the fastest to their

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.770 
that go pretty be the fastest to their
under<00:05:18.570> schema<00:05:18.870> tiles<00:05:19.110> at<00:05:19.230> lemon<00:05:20.600> there's<00:05:21.600> then
