what<00:00:09.300> you<00:00:09.450> did<00:00:10.309> well<00:00:11.309> it<00:00:11.400> started<00:00:11.790> pretty<00:00:12.000> far

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
what you did well it started pretty far

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.839 
what you did well it started pretty far
away<00:00:12.450> from<00:00:12.630> this<00:00:12.990> so<00:00:13.710> this<00:00:13.950> is<00:00:14.009> where<00:00:14.490> the

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
away from this so this is where the

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.420 
away from this so this is where the
rocker<00:00:15.120> design<00:00:15.420> really<00:00:16.049> began

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
rocker design really began

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.730 
rocker design really began
I<00:00:17.460> built<00:00:18.240> this<00:00:18.449> very<00:00:18.750> crude<00:00:20.630> prototype<00:00:21.630> and<00:00:21.900> I

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
I built this very crude prototype and I

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.349 
I built this very crude prototype and I
had<00:00:22.949> different<00:00:23.369> sized<00:00:23.609> rockers<00:00:24.180> and

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
had different sized rockers and

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:25.939 
had different sized rockers and
different<00:00:24.630> shapes<00:00:24.900> for<00:00:25.019> the<00:00:25.199> rockers<00:00:25.590> and<00:00:25.890> I

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
different shapes for the rockers and I

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.460 
different shapes for the rockers and I
tried<00:00:26.220> different<00:00:26.400> seat<00:00:26.849> shapes<00:00:27.180> and<00:00:27.599> adjusted

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
tried different seat shapes and adjusted

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:29.900 
tried different seat shapes and adjusted
things<00:00:28.710> back<00:00:28.920> and<00:00:29.130> forth<00:00:29.369> and<00:00:29.580> moved<00:00:29.760> the

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
things back and forth and moved the

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.600 
things back and forth and moved the
rockers<00:00:30.359> in<00:00:31.349> and<00:00:31.590> out<00:00:31.740> and<00:00:32.009> back<00:00:32.160> and<00:00:32.189> forth

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
rockers in and out and back and forth

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.610 
rockers in and out and back and forth
and<00:00:32.790> up<00:00:32.910> and<00:00:33.120> down<00:00:33.180> until<00:00:34.020> I<00:00:34.050> came<00:00:34.410> up<00:00:34.590> with

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
and up and down until I came up with

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.660 
and up and down until I came up with
something<00:00:35.010> that<00:00:35.550> was<00:00:36.469> to<00:00:37.469> my<00:00:37.620> mind<00:00:37.890> very

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
something that was to my mind very

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.819 
something that was to my mind very
comfortable<00:00:39.180> that's<00:00:39.899> interesting<00:00:40.410> you<00:00:40.500> start

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
comfortable that's interesting you start

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.819 
comfortable that's interesting you start
here<00:00:41.399> something<00:00:42.180> that<00:00:42.210> wouldn't<00:00:42.780> sell<00:00:43.050> and

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
here something that wouldn't sell and

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:44.600 
here something that wouldn't sell and
not<00:00:44.010> at<00:00:44.160> all

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
not at all

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.459 
not at all
not<00:00:44.820> at<00:00:44.940> all<00:00:45.030> but<00:00:45.180> I<00:00:45.270> needed<00:00:45.570> to<00:00:45.719> learn<00:00:46.110> I

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
not at all but I needed to learn I

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.770 
not at all but I needed to learn I
needed<00:00:47.010> to<00:00:47.190> learn<00:00:47.399> what<00:00:47.670> was<00:00:47.789> going<00:00:48.120> on<00:00:48.270> in<00:00:48.510> a

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
needed to learn what was going on in a

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.160 
needed to learn what was going on in a
rocking<00:00:49.170> chair<00:00:49.410> is<00:00:49.590> so<00:00:49.950> complex<00:00:50.940> in<00:00:51.420> the

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
rocking chair is so complex in the

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.430 
rocking chair is so complex in the
interaction<00:00:52.890> as<00:00:53.010> you<00:00:53.309> know<00:00:53.520> very<00:00:54.180> well<00:00:54.239> is<00:00:55.110> so

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
interaction as you know very well is so

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:56.810 
interaction as you know very well is so
complex<00:00:55.890> in<00:00:56.129> the<00:00:56.219> interaction<00:00:56.789> between

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
complex in the interaction between

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.720 
complex in the interaction between
seating<00:00:57.600> back<00:00:57.809> and<00:00:58.109> the<00:00:58.170> rockers<00:00:58.649> and<00:00:58.949> how<00:00:59.550> it

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
seating back and the rockers and how it

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.049 
seating back and the rockers and how it
rocks<00:00:59.940> and<00:01:00.329> how<00:01:00.449> much<00:01:00.660> it<00:01:00.840> tips<00:01:01.050> back<00:01:01.730> that<00:01:02.730> I

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
rocks and how much it tips back that I

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.539 
rocks and how much it tips back that I
really<00:01:03.719> felt<00:01:03.960> like<00:01:04.049> I<00:01:04.320> needed<00:01:04.530> to<00:01:04.680> start<00:01:05.280> at

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
really felt like I needed to start at

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.469 
really felt like I needed to start at
Ground<00:01:06.380> Zero<00:01:07.380> with<00:01:07.979> this<00:01:08.220> so<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.119> next<00:01:09.270> thing

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
Ground Zero with this so the next thing

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.600 
Ground Zero with this so the next thing
I<00:01:09.600> did<00:01:09.810> was<00:01:10.110> I<00:01:10.380> took<00:01:10.530> the<00:01:10.860> side<00:01:11.100> off<00:01:11.310> of<00:01:11.490> my

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
I did was I took the side off of my

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.750 
I did was I took the side off of my
ground<00:01:11.850> zero<00:01:12.380> here<00:01:13.380> and<00:01:13.470> I<00:01:14.159> traced<00:01:14.580> the

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
ground zero here and I traced the

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.850 
ground zero here and I traced the
important<00:01:15.299> curves<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:15.750> seat<00:01:16.020> the<00:01:16.470> shape<00:01:16.680> of

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
important curves the seat the shape of

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:22.609 
important curves the seat the shape of
the<00:01:16.950> back<00:01:17.630> and<00:01:18.630> the<00:01:19.560> rocker<00:01:19.850> onto<00:01:20.850> this<00:01:21.619> piece

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
the back and the rocker onto this piece

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:27.080 
the back and the rocker onto this piece
of<00:01:22.770> foam<00:01:22.979> core<00:01:23.570> Radi<00:01:24.570> as<00:01:24.810> it<00:01:25.020> is<00:01:25.200> and<00:01:25.820> from<00:01:26.820> that

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
of foam core Radi as it is and from that

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.330 
of foam core Radi as it is and from that
started<00:01:27.659> to<00:01:27.750> generate<00:01:28.229> the<00:01:28.439> lines<00:01:28.680> and<00:01:29.100> I

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
started to generate the lines and I

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.340 
started to generate the lines and I
spent<00:01:30.150> a<00:01:30.240> lot<00:01:30.360> of<00:01:30.420> time<00:01:30.659> with<00:01:30.869> pencil<00:01:31.259> and

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
spent a lot of time with pencil and

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.859 
spent a lot of time with pencil and
eraser<00:01:31.470> I've<00:01:31.979> traced<00:01:32.520> over<00:01:32.729> the<00:01:33.119> important

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
eraser I've traced over the important

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.920 
eraser I've traced over the important
lines<00:01:34.049> here<00:01:34.350> with<00:01:34.500> a<00:01:34.530> marker<00:01:35.220> but<00:01:36.180> spent<00:01:36.840> a

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
lines here with a marker but spent a

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.980 
lines here with a marker but spent a
great<00:01:37.110> deal<00:01:37.170> of<00:01:37.350> time<00:01:38.390> fully<00:01:39.390> around<00:01:39.689> trying

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
great deal of time fully around trying

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.620 
great deal of time fully around trying
to<00:01:40.049> come<00:01:40.200> up<00:01:40.290> with<00:01:40.409> something<00:01:40.770> that<00:01:40.920> actually

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:41.630 
to come up with something that actually

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:43.760 
to come up with something that actually
looked<00:01:42.630> like<00:01:42.750> what<00:01:43.049> I<00:01:43.079> wanted<00:01:43.439> it<00:01:43.530> to<00:01:43.649> look

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
looked like what I wanted it to look

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.550 
looked like what I wanted it to look
like<00:01:43.829> I<00:01:44.130> had<00:01:44.310> something<00:01:44.729> in<00:01:44.850> mind<00:01:45.090> for<00:01:45.530> how<00:01:46.530> I

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
like I had something in mind for how I

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.149 
like I had something in mind for how I
wanted<00:01:46.950> this<00:01:47.040> to<00:01:47.220> look<00:01:47.399> and<00:01:48.770> this<00:01:49.770> is<00:01:49.979> what<00:01:50.130> I

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
wanted this to look and this is what I

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.960 
wanted this to look and this is what I
came<00:01:50.250> up<00:01:50.399> with<00:01:50.520> and<00:01:50.909> then<00:01:51.540> I<00:01:51.840> had<00:01:52.820> lots<00:01:53.820> more

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
came up with and then I had lots more

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.190 
came up with and then I had lots more
work<00:01:54.299> to<00:01:54.479> figure<00:01:54.689> out<00:01:54.990> what<00:01:55.860> was<00:01:56.040> going<00:01:56.100> on

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:57.200 
work to figure out what was going on

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.780 
work to figure out what was going on
this<00:01:58.200> joint<00:01:58.530> is<00:01:58.680> pretty<00:01:59.130> crazy

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
this joint is pretty crazy

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.940 
this joint is pretty crazy
because<00:02:00.509> all<00:02:00.840> three<00:02:01.439> of<00:02:01.560> these<00:02:01.619> components

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
because all three of these components

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.120 
because all three of these components
actually<00:02:02.820> wind<00:02:03.000> up<00:02:03.149> coming<00:02:03.509> down<00:02:03.840> all<00:02:04.590> the<00:02:04.950> way

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
actually wind up coming down all the way

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.740 
actually wind up coming down all the way
to<00:02:05.460> the<00:02:06.390> rocker<00:02:06.799> for<00:02:07.799> structural<00:02:08.750> purposes

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
to the rocker for structural purposes

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.600 
to the rocker for structural purposes
you<00:02:10.080> know<00:02:10.259> this<00:02:10.770> has<00:02:11.310> to<00:02:11.340> be

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
you know this has to be

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:14.920 
you know this has to be
have<00:02:13.610> the<00:02:13.760> integrity<00:02:14.030> of<00:02:14.390> coming<00:02:14.659> all<00:02:14.810> the<00:02:14.900> way

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
have the integrity of coming all the way

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:17.710 
have the integrity of coming all the way
down<00:02:15.230> to<00:02:15.470> the<00:02:15.560> rocker<00:02:15.769> as<00:02:16.099> do<00:02:16.489> the<00:02:16.640> others<00:02:16.939> and

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
down to the rocker as do the others and

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.140 
down to the rocker as do the others and
so<00:02:18.319> that<00:02:18.680> joint<00:02:19.040> took<00:02:19.280> me<00:02:19.430> quite<00:02:19.610> a<00:02:19.700> while<00:02:19.819> to

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
so that joint took me quite a while to

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.780 
so that joint took me quite a while to
figure<00:02:20.299> out<00:02:21.069> figuring<00:02:22.069> out<00:02:22.189> the<00:02:22.280> shapes<00:02:22.549> of

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
figure out figuring out the shapes of

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:24.460 
figure out figuring out the shapes of
each<00:02:22.939> of<00:02:23.120> these<00:02:23.209> components<00:02:23.870> and<00:02:24.079> then<00:02:24.260> the

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470 
each of these components and then the

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:27.160 
each of these components and then the
refinements<00:02:25.129> of<00:02:25.250> the<00:02:25.370> edges<00:02:25.790> and<00:02:26.170> different

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
refinements of the edges and different

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.830 
refinements of the edges and different
treatments<00:02:27.709> for<00:02:28.280> every<00:02:29.000> element<00:02:29.450> was

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
treatments for every element was

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.979 
treatments for every element was
something<00:02:30.379> that<00:02:30.409> took<00:02:31.099> time<00:02:31.720> in<00:02:32.720> some<00:02:32.959> cases

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:32.989 
something that took time in some cases

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:35.319 
something that took time in some cases
took<00:02:33.500> different<00:02:33.680> generations<00:02:34.430> which

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:35.329 
took different generations which

00:02:35.329 --> 00:02:38.740 
took different generations which
components<00:02:36.200> are<00:02:37.299> laminations<00:02:38.299> and<00:02:38.569> which

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
components are laminations and which

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:44.050 
components are laminations and which
components<00:02:39.620> are<00:02:39.819> solid<00:02:40.930> so<00:02:42.459> the<00:02:43.459> lamination

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
components are solid so the lamination

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:45.399 
components are solid so the lamination
which<00:02:44.269> is<00:02:44.420> something<00:02:44.569> I've<00:02:44.780> done<00:02:44.959> a<00:02:45.109> lot<00:02:45.349> of

00:02:45.399 --> 00:02:45.409 
which is something I've done a lot of

00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:48.069 
which is something I've done a lot of
over<00:02:45.920> the<00:02:46.010> years<00:02:46.569> the<00:02:47.569> rocker<00:02:47.840> is<00:02:48.049> a

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:48.079 
over the years the rocker is a

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:50.470 
over the years the rocker is a
lamination<00:02:48.560> and<00:02:48.920> then<00:02:49.370> all<00:02:49.609> of<00:02:49.940> these<00:02:50.120> bent

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
lamination and then all of these bent

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:54.430 
lamination and then all of these bent
components<00:02:51.459> the<00:02:52.459> front<00:02:52.879> leg<00:02:53.200> that<00:02:54.200> loops

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 
components the front leg that loops

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:58.119 
components the front leg that loops
around<00:02:54.769> the<00:02:54.980> arm<00:02:55.190> support<00:02:55.700> and<00:02:55.909> the<00:02:56.000> back<00:02:57.129> legs

that's<00:03:07.370> beautiful<00:03:08.260> now<00:03:09.260> what's<00:03:09.530> the<00:03:09.739> next

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:09.920 
that's beautiful now what's the next

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:11.580 
that's beautiful now what's the next
step

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590 
step

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:14.550 
step
the<00:03:12.100> next<00:03:12.400> step<00:03:12.550> here<00:03:13.140> involves<00:03:14.140> sort<00:03:14.380> of<00:03:14.470> a

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 
the next step here involves sort of a

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:18.420 
the next step here involves sort of a
three-dimensional<00:03:15.430> sketch<00:03:15.790> and<00:03:17.220> it<00:03:18.220> was

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:18.430 
three-dimensional sketch and it was

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:19.500 
three-dimensional sketch and it was
something<00:03:18.700> that<00:03:18.850> was<00:03:19.000> cobbled<00:03:19.300> together

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:19.510 
something that was cobbled together

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:23.150 
something that was cobbled together
together<00:03:20.260> out<00:03:20.709> of<00:03:20.890> quarter-inch<00:03:21.520> plywood<00:03:21.880> and

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
together out of quarter-inch plywood and

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.620 
together out of quarter-inch plywood and
scraps<00:03:24.160> of<00:03:24.400> whatever<00:03:24.790> would<00:03:25.090> I<00:03:25.120> happen<00:03:25.600> to

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:25.630 
scraps of whatever would I happen to

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:29.850 
scraps of whatever would I happen to
have<00:03:26.010> around<00:03:27.010> and<00:03:28.140> built<00:03:29.140> up<00:03:29.319> something<00:03:29.830> that

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:29.860 
have around and built up something that

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:32.760 
have around and built up something that
at<00:03:30.760> least<00:03:31.239> let<00:03:31.720> me<00:03:31.930> know<00:03:32.140> that<00:03:32.170> I<00:03:32.380> was<00:03:32.560> on<00:03:32.680> the

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:32.770 
at least let me know that I was on the

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:33.479 
at least let me know that I was on the
right<00:03:32.890> track

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:33.489 
right track

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:35.190 
right track
that<00:03:33.700> three<00:03:34.090> dimensionally<00:03:34.690> that<00:03:34.900> this<00:03:35.020> was

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:35.200 
that three dimensionally that this was

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:37.530 
that three dimensionally that this was
going<00:03:35.380> to<00:03:35.440> start<00:03:35.709> to<00:03:35.830> work<00:03:36.010> out<00:03:36.280> and<00:03:36.610> be

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:37.540 
going to start to work out and be

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.809 
going to start to work out and be
something<00:03:37.959> that<00:03:38.380> I<00:03:38.590> would<00:03:38.800> continue<00:03:39.310> to<00:03:39.550> want

00:03:39.809 --> 00:03:39.819 
something that I would continue to want

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:42.840 
something that I would continue to want
to<00:03:39.910> pursue<00:03:40.230> so<00:03:41.310> walking<00:03:42.310> a<00:03:42.370> little<00:03:42.489> further

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:42.850 
to pursue so walking a little further

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:44.370 
to pursue so walking a little further
down<00:03:43.000> the<00:03:43.270> path<00:03:43.480> and<00:03:43.690> making<00:03:43.989> some<00:03:44.140> choices

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:44.380 
down the path and making some choices

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:46.410 
down the path and making some choices
and<00:03:44.830> making<00:03:45.280> sure<00:03:45.550> I<00:03:45.580> was<00:03:45.820> still<00:03:46.000> going<00:03:46.269> down

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:46.420 
and making sure I was still going down

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:49.100 
and making sure I was still going down
the<00:03:46.660> path<00:03:46.870> in<00:03:47.080> the<00:03:47.170> right<00:03:47.350> direction<00:03:47.530> and<00:03:48.070> that

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:49.110 
the path in the right direction and that

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:53.070 
the path in the right direction and that
indeed<00:03:50.110> was<00:03:50.320> the<00:03:50.470> case<00:03:50.680> and<00:03:50.980> I<00:03:51.040> then<00:03:51.400> made<00:03:52.080> made

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:53.080 
indeed was the case and I then made made

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:56.900 
indeed was the case and I then made made
some<00:03:53.290> bendings<00:03:53.739> based<00:03:54.459> on<00:03:54.670> this<00:03:55.170> out<00:03:56.170> of

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910 
some bendings based on this out of

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:59.550 
some bendings based on this out of
eighth<00:03:57.910> inch<00:03:58.180> bending<00:03:58.569> plywood<00:03:59.230> did<00:03:59.530> i

00:03:59.550 --> 00:03:59.560 
eighth inch bending plywood did i

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:01.320 
eighth inch bending plywood did i
laminated<00:03:59.830> together<00:04:00.400> something<00:04:01.150> that<00:04:01.269> I

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:01.330 
laminated together something that I

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:03.390 
laminated together something that I
could<00:04:01.510> deal<00:04:01.690> with<00:04:01.720> very<00:04:02.080> quickly<00:04:02.350> and<00:04:02.830> started

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:03.400 
could deal with very quickly and started

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:04.890 
could deal with very quickly and started
cutting<00:04:03.610> and<00:04:03.760> shaping<00:04:04.030> that<00:04:04.360> and<00:04:04.630> seeing

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:04.900 
cutting and shaping that and seeing

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:05.930 
cutting and shaping that and seeing
where<00:04:05.080> that<00:04:05.260> was<00:04:05.470> going

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:05.940 
where that was going

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:10.470 
where that was going
and<00:04:06.989> then<00:04:08.400> refinement<00:04:09.400> and<00:04:09.640> putting<00:04:10.269> more

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:10.480 
and then refinement and putting more

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:12.660 
and then refinement and putting more
things<00:04:10.840> together<00:04:11.080> and<00:04:11.650> seeing<00:04:12.069> where<00:04:12.310> it<00:04:12.430> goes

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:12.670 
things together and seeing where it goes

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:16.080 
things together and seeing where it goes
and<00:04:13.170> spending<00:04:14.170> more<00:04:14.290> time<00:04:14.500> we<00:04:15.220> have<00:04:15.250> seen<00:04:15.640> over

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:16.090 
and spending more time we have seen over

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:19.349 
and spending more time we have seen over
and<00:04:16.180> over<00:04:16.299> again<00:04:16.630> and<00:04:17.220> this<00:04:18.220> master<00:04:18.820> series
