Sport gland and I'm gonna show you how

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:08.870 
Sport gland and I'm gonna show you how
to<00:00:06.750> use<00:00:06.930> the<00:00:07.170> manky<00:00:07.830> strap<00:00:08.130> manky<00:00:08.490> strap<00:00:08.730> is

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880 
to use the manky strap manky strap is

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.350 
to use the manky strap manky strap is
basically<00:00:09.269> heavy-duty<00:00:09.990> shoelace<00:00:11.210> it's<00:00:12.210> heavy

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
basically heavy-duty shoelace it's heavy

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.060 
basically heavy-duty shoelace it's heavy
enough<00:00:12.630> to<00:00:12.690> hold<00:00:13.170> your<00:00:13.320> entire<00:00:13.590> body<00:00:13.860> weight

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:25.640 
and out of the gland using the spokes

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.599 
and out of the gland using the spokes
keeping<00:00:26.640> the<00:00:26.760> gland<00:00:27.000> tight<00:00:27.390> is<00:00:27.689> the<00:00:28.609> number

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
keeping the gland tight is the number

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.580 
keeping the gland tight is the number
one<00:00:29.820> goal<00:00:30.060> whether<00:00:30.720> you're<00:00:30.900> using<00:00:31.019> the<00:00:31.289> manky

strap or using the zip ties so after you
go<00:00:34.850> over<00:00:35.850> under<00:00:36.030> through<00:00:36.420> all<00:00:36.899> the<00:00:37.050> spokes

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
go over under through all the spokes

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:38.600 
go over under through all the spokes
through<00:00:37.649> all<00:00:37.770> the<00:00:37.860> holes<00:00:38.010> in<00:00:38.219> your<00:00:38.309> gland

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
back cause you can see holds it onto

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.670 
back cause you can see holds it onto
your<00:00:47.010> spokes<00:00:47.450> the<00:00:48.450> strap<00:00:48.960> or<00:00:49.200> the<00:00:49.320> zip<00:00:49.469> tie

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
being really tight is the most important

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.029 
being really tight is the most important
part<00:00:52.890> of<00:00:53.010> keeping<00:00:53.460> it<00:00:53.760> together<00:00:54.230> and<00:00:55.230> working

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
part of keeping it together and working

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:01.459 
part of keeping it together and working
properly<00:00:56.250> so<00:00:59.449> after<00:01:00.449> this<00:01:00.600> last<00:01:00.899> hole<00:01:01.289> right

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
properly so after this last hole right

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:09.880 
properly so after this last hole right
here<00:01:02.120> grab<00:01:03.120> both<00:01:03.300> ends<00:01:07.580> it's<00:01:08.580> twisted

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:09.890 
here grab both ends it's twisted

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:14.240 
here grab both ends it's twisted
I'll<00:01:10.890> grab<00:01:11.100> both<00:01:11.310> ends<00:01:12.680> pull<00:01:13.680> as<00:01:13.860> tight<00:01:13.890> as

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
I'll grab both ends pull as tight as

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.219 
I'll grab both ends pull as tight as
possible<00:01:16.070> so<00:01:17.070> the<00:01:17.369> strap<00:01:17.670> is<00:01:17.970> under<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:18.900> edges

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
possible so the strap is under the edges

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.359 
possible so the strap is under the edges
of<00:01:19.439> the<00:01:19.619> indentions<00:01:20.520> guard<00:01:21.920> now<00:01:22.920> you<00:01:22.979> want<00:01:23.340> to

knot which you can't really do without

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.190 
knot which you can't really do without
somebody<00:01:47.880> else's<00:01:48.149> finger<00:01:48.570> holding<00:01:48.869> it<00:01:49.020> there

something but he use that double
starting<00:01:54.090> knot<00:01:54.270> then<00:01:54.810> you<00:01:54.930> could<00:01:55.079> do<00:01:55.229> it<00:01:55.380> by

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
starting knot then you could do it by

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:01.160 
starting knot then you could do it by
yourself<00:01:57.409> most<00:01:58.409> times<00:01:58.680> you<00:01:58.860> can<00:01:59.869> cut<00:02:00.869> off<00:02:00.990> the
