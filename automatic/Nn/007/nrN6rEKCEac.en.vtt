00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:20.429 
blow dryer and then game on and I've
already<00:01:19.450> tested<00:01:19.600> it<00:01:19.840> once<00:01:19.929> it<00:01:20.109> works<00:01:20.229> pretty

00:01:20.429 --> 00:01:20.439

my little scraps to start get it up to

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:49.720 
my little scraps to start get it up to
temperature<00:03:48.230> so<00:03:48.830> we'll<00:03:48.980> get<00:03:49.130> it<00:03:49.220> set<00:03:49.370> that<00:03:49.430> guy

temperature so we'll get it set that guy
in<00:03:49.880> there<00:03:50.090> to<00:03:51.250> see<00:03:52.250> if<00:03:52.310> we<00:03:52.400> can't<00:03:52.670> start

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:52.970 
in there to see if we can't start

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:57.570 
in there to see if we can't start
building<00:03:53.330> that

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:57.580 

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:01.199 

pretty<00:03:58.580> hard

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:09.430 

all<00:04:01.689> right<00:04:02.280> let's<00:04:03.280> see<00:04:03.430> how<00:04:03.519> long<00:04:03.670> it<00:04:03.879> takes

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:09.440 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:11.770 

that<00:04:10.010> Steel's<00:04:10.400> already<00:04:10.760> get<00:04:10.940> talk<00:04:11.210> so<00:04:11.630> I've

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:11.780 
that Steel's already get talk so I've

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:23.360 
that Steel's already get talk so I've
been<00:04:11.900> in<00:04:12.020> there<00:04:12.200> for<00:04:12.470> three<00:04:13.460> or<00:04:13.580> four<00:04:13.790> minutes
