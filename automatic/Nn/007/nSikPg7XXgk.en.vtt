00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 For you that have dog or cat this video 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:06.680
 It will be especially interesting. 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:11.519
 there was a judgment here on stj 

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:14.630
 concerning the collection of ipi on diets 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:18.480
 for dogs and cats and the first class 

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:21.960
 has simply decided that it is 10% 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:25.080
 aliquot of ipi in rations above 10 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:27.060
 kilos or basically who to buy 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.640
 there is mainly reason above 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.920
 10 pounds will pay more but actually 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.360
 not only who buys the ratio above 10 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.630
 Pounds you'll see more ahead 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:39.930
 because then the whole question is whether the 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:42.660
 for dogs and cats will be framed in 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.489
 another category between these two that 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.530
 You are now seeing on the screen the most 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.210
 interesting is the understanding of a 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.950
 stj's minister 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.370
 a lot of people criticized me because I always 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:55.530
 jurists criticized the dea of which the 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.489
 their heads just sucks and here we 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:01.199
 can fully prove for example 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:02.309
 minister benedito gonÃ§alves was the vote 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.949
 winner 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.930
 he simply explained why the 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.400
 differentiation of the table items leads 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.840
 into account the principle of 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.970
 selectivity 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.040
 but according to him the dog food and 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.689
 cats are intended for public with high 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.460
 purchasing power that 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.520
 supply of such foods rather than 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.259
 use more basic forms of nutrition 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:24.330
 I do not know when that minister 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:27.060
 Live because the time is gone when 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:29.640
 Did you prepare your dog's food? 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.320
 making that rice that 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.380
 mix you buy today the reason is very 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:37.229
 more practical food is already complete and I 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.570
 I do not see why this is exclusive to 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.490
 people with high purchasing power 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.970
 this only shows a socialist view 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:47.670
 and deformed reality where the state 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:50.159
 decides to punish who can who has the power 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.470
 to buy a 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:55.829
 your dog is actually doing the 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:58.170
 correct to deliver is not this 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:00.119
 money through taxes to 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.460
 state bureaucrats who will use 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:05.340
 Unfortunately that money 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:07.200
 the funniest minister ever spoke 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.879
 framework for dog and dog 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.069
 cats a topic of complete rations 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:13.440
 would end up emptying the reference item 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:15.240
 to rations for dogs and cats sold 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.770
 because there would be no product left 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:20.220
 significant be included in such a 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:23.190
 that is, they create two 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:25.530
 categories in the case the national farm 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:28.050
 government that I have two categories and 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:30.030
 a simply gay stj's minister 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.250
 that we have to pay more for the 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:35.010
 reason why otherwise neither the item will 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.120
 to fill that category is well 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:38.460
 funny, huh? 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:41.790
 even to suggest you to download yo 

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:43.830
 ipi table is always thinking that 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:46.140
 that's federal tax ie tax 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:47.700
 that the dilma could be reduced by this 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:50.370
 that I laugh at who thinks that pt 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:52.080
 will reduce something never told us anything and 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:55.200
 I'm just going to draw from one side 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:58.650
 Other, if this does not increase then 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:01.890
 download this file there and see the effort 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:04.500
 that the thief in the case the government makes to 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:07.560
 Steal from your pocket, you're just 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:09.840
 practice a voluntary exchange with the 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:12.390
 producer is that he is also 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.130
 practicing an exchange come back with you 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:15.780
 selling a product you want and the 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:18.450
 government between 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:22.459
 inconvenient intermediary that no one 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:25.290
 asked and it's incredible, right? 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:29.160
 is simply to accept this being that 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:31.560
 this was a resource analyzed after 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:33.750
 a decision of the federal regional court 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.700
 want a lower instance 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:37.680
 that no 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:39.900
 aliquot then the question of 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:43.730
 interpretation and these ministers serve 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:46.260
 hakim serves the state to the government is obvious 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:47.580
 even this will have three consequences 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:50.070
 immediate 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:53.670
 the first is the price of the ration goes 

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:56.519
 increase according to the manufacturer actually 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:58.800
 it may louis i raise 1 various types 

00:03:56.519 --> 00:04:01.800
 inclusive rationing that is below 

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:05.130
 10 pounds not only the above 10 pounds and 

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:08.010
 third they may also decide to change 

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:11.220
 the ration formula will dare something more 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:13.160
 Cheap is not to compensate is this increase 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:15.989
 of the cost since they may not want 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:18.120
 that I personally do this because the 

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:20.220
 market an expanding market has 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:22.860
 a forecast is to move 13 billion 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:24.750
 now in 2012 is a great market that 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:26.620
 must not suffer any kind of 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:29.110
 obstacle by the government 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:30.610
 extreme stupidity everything that goes against 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:32.560
 market is stupid 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:35.500
 and of course it will only make Brazil stay 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:38.410
 less competitive than it is already a 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:41.199
 least competitive countries in the world 

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:44.669
 Congratulations dilma rousseff you every time 

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:44.669
 sinking more brazil
