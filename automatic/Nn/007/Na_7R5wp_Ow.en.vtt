edge<00:00:26.160> of<00:00:26.310> glory<00:00:26.460> anymore<00:00:27.300> because<00:00:27.830> apparently

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
edge of glory anymore because apparently

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.620 
edge of glory anymore because apparently
YouTube<00:00:29.189> has<00:00:29.340> different<00:00:29.789> copyright<00:00:30.300> clause

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
YouTube has different copyright clause

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.560 
YouTube has different copyright clause
so<00:00:31.529> you<00:00:31.980> can't<00:00:32.340> really<00:00:32.489> sing<00:00:33.059> the<00:00:33.329> edge<00:00:33.420> of

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
so you can't really sing the edge of

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.900 
so you can't really sing the edge of
glory<00:00:33.719> and<00:00:34.050> it's<00:00:34.950> a<00:00:35.010> good<00:00:35.130> thing<00:00:35.190> like<00:00:35.610> they

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
glory and it's a good thing like they

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.260 
glory and it's a good thing like they
say<00:00:36.149> that<00:00:36.390> if<00:00:36.690> it's<00:00:37.350> not<00:00:37.579> 14<00:00:38.579> seconds<00:00:39.059> long

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
say that if it's not 14 seconds long

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.840 
say that if it's not 14 seconds long
then<00:00:40.200> you<00:00:40.410> got<00:00:40.559> no<00:00:40.770> issue<00:00:40.800> like<00:00:41.340> if<00:00:41.489> it's<00:00:41.700> not

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
then you got no issue like if it's not

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.750 
then you got no issue like if it's not
less<00:00:42.780> if<00:00:43.050> it's<00:00:43.230> not<00:00:43.440> more<00:00:43.710> than<00:00:43.920> 14<00:00:44.399> seconds

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
less if it's not more than 14 seconds

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.000 
less if it's not more than 14 seconds
long<00:00:44.940> then<00:00:45.450> you<00:00:45.539> don't<00:00:45.660> have<00:00:45.870> an<00:00:45.989> issue<00:00:46.110> but<00:00:46.440> if

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
long then you don't have an issue but if

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.799 
long then you don't have an issue but if
it<00:00:47.219> is<00:00:47.370> then<00:00:47.730> you<00:00:47.760> got<00:00:48.000> a<00:00:48.030> problem<00:00:48.300> man<00:00:48.719> but<00:00:49.530> oh

00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:50.809

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
that's a good thing because my my other

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.930 
that's a good thing because my my other
videos<00:00:54.360> I<00:00:54.719> never<00:00:55.530> actually<00:00:55.800> sung<00:00:56.309> until<00:00:56.699> like

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.420 
14 seconds only like two seconds so
that's<00:01:00.390> good<00:01:00.600> that's<00:01:00.870> good<00:01:00.960> if<00:01:01.289> if<00:01:01.980> I<00:01:02.129> have<00:01:02.280> to
