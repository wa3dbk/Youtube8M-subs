00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:16.279
 psv played 35 times before 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:17.480
 competition at home against FC

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:21.769
 27 of those encounters and played seven 

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:23.419
 time went right for the season 

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:25.519
 undefeated status in it 

00:00:23.419 --> 00:00:28.159
 debut competition of ernest faber here 

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:29.839
 PSV Phillip Cocu and temporarily replaced 

00:00:28.159 --> 00:00:32.899
 that while the people of Eindhoven still like 

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:35.300
 shot a rocket out of the starting blocks 

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:38.870
 let things just says sorry day 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:41.109
 swipe all this option for psv then 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:41.109

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.680
 WC 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.080
 but that good start did not get any 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.790
 To prosecute stronger FC Groningen would this 

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:56.070
 bend backwards and eventually with 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:57.990
 three two win and with that as said 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.240
 the first competitive victory in the philips 

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:02.610
 stadium booking also comes this season 

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:04.979
 PSV does not win from FC Groningen in the 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:06.479
 euroborg end the duel in a one 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.400

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.830
 psv also the away match forces you not 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.510

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.220
 the phillip cocu team is already waiting 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:19.170

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.460
 groningen 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.800
 but history is mainly characterized 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.479
 due to successes the team became in 2006 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.800
