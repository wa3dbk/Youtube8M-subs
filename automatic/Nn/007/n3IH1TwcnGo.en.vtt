lawn tractor specifically the controls

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.259 
lawn tractor specifically the controls

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
and how they function if we've been

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:25.939 
and how they function if we've been
using<00:00:24.570> this<00:00:24.810> tractor<00:00:25.199> for<00:00:25.380> a<00:00:25.410> few<00:00:25.619> weeks<00:00:25.769> now

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
is where we have our gas gauge a little

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:02.900 
is where we have our gas gauge a little
window<00:01:01.469> to<00:01:01.500> see<00:01:01.739> how<00:01:01.859> much<00:01:02.010> gas<00:01:02.280> is<00:01:02.520> in<00:01:02.670> the

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
window to see how much gas is in the

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.260 
window to see how much gas is in the

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
tank here we have our throttle and our

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.719 
tank here we have our throttle and our
choke<00:01:06.540> control<00:01:06.990> here<00:01:07.830> we<00:01:08.010> have<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:08.520> lever

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
choke control here we have the lever

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.080 
choke control here we have the lever
that<00:01:09.000> engages<00:01:09.720> the<00:01:10.670> accessories<00:01:11.670> and<00:01:11.880> in<00:01:11.939> our

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
that engages the accessories and in our

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.210 
that engages the accessories and in our
case<00:01:12.360> that<00:01:12.600> would<00:01:12.990> be<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.500> mower<00:01:13.770> blades

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
case that would be the mower blades

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.760 
case that would be the mower blades
itself<00:01:14.760> so<00:01:15.420> this<00:01:15.720> this<00:01:16.110> is<00:01:16.350> the<00:01:16.470> lever<00:01:16.650> that

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
itself so this this is the lever that

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.730 
itself so this this is the lever that
engages<00:01:17.700> your<00:01:17.850> mower<00:01:18.509> blades<00:01:18.869> once<00:01:19.560> it's

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
engages your mower blades once it's

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.700 
engages your mower blades once it's
running<00:01:19.939> here<00:01:20.939> is<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.180> ignition<00:01:21.450> and<00:01:21.780> over

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
running here is the ignition and over

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.960 
running here is the ignition and over
here<00:01:22.979> we<00:01:23.130> have<00:01:23.310> gas<00:01:23.990> pedal<00:01:24.990> and<00:01:25.170> reverse<00:01:26.100> this

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
here we have gas pedal and reverse this

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.550 
here we have gas pedal and reverse this
button<00:01:27.360> is<00:01:27.450> important<00:01:27.990> you<00:01:28.170> also<00:01:28.259> need<00:01:28.530> to

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
button is important you also need to

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.170 
button is important you also need to
know<00:01:28.740> about<00:01:28.829> that<00:01:29.189> if<00:01:29.640> you<00:01:29.729> ever<00:01:29.880> need<00:01:30.150> to

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
know about that if you ever need to

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.149 
know about that if you ever need to
reverse<00:01:30.689> while<00:01:31.170> you're<00:01:31.530> mowing<00:01:31.770> and<00:01:32.100> the

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
reverse while you're mowing and the

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.580 
reverse while you're mowing and the
blades<00:01:32.490> are<00:01:32.700> engaged<00:01:33.090> if<00:01:33.450> you<00:01:33.960> just<00:01:34.200> hit<00:01:34.380> the

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
blades are engaged if you just hit the

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.280 
blades are engaged if you just hit the
reverse<00:01:34.950> pedal<00:01:35.460> it<00:01:35.640> will<00:01:36.210> actually<00:01:36.689> stall<00:01:37.020> out

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
reverse pedal it will actually stall out

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.140 
reverse pedal it will actually stall out
the<00:01:37.500> mower<00:01:37.710> because<00:01:38.130> it's<00:01:38.460> dangerous<00:01:38.970> to<00:01:39.119> be

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
the mower because it's dangerous to be

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.090 
the mower because it's dangerous to be
running<00:01:39.570> this<00:01:39.720> mower<00:01:39.960> in<00:01:40.170> Reverse<00:01:40.530> if<00:01:40.829> someone

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
running this mower in Reverse if someone

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.200 
running this mower in Reverse if someone
was<00:01:41.250> behind<00:01:41.579> you<00:01:41.820> of<00:01:41.909> course

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
was behind you of course

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.940 
was behind you of course
and<00:01:42.390> so<00:01:42.750> this<00:01:42.869> mower<00:01:43.140> has<00:01:43.409> a<00:01:43.439> reverse

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
and so this mower has a reverse

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.190 
and so this mower has a reverse
implement<00:01:44.579> option<00:01:45.060> as<00:01:45.210> you<00:01:45.420> see<00:01:45.600> here<00:01:45.930> and<00:01:46.140> if

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
implement option as you see here and if

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.660 
implement option as you see here and if
I<00:01:46.320> need<00:01:46.500> to<00:01:46.590> reverse<00:01:46.890> with<00:01:47.189> the<00:01:47.340> blades

I need to reverse with the blades

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.359 
I need to reverse with the blades
engaged<00:01:48.149> I<00:01:48.420> need<00:01:48.570> to<00:01:48.689> check<00:01:48.930> behind<00:01:49.259> make<00:01:50.159> sure

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
engaged I need to check behind make sure

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.520 
engaged I need to check behind make sure
that<00:01:50.520> it's<00:01:50.700> clear<00:01:51.210> I<00:01:51.329> can<00:01:51.780> hit<00:01:51.990> that<00:01:52.200> button
