00:05:10.029 --> 00:05:10.039 
better idea for him if he just kept all

00:05:10.039 --> 00:05:12.400 
better idea for him if he just kept all
his<00:05:10.130> units<00:05:10.400> together<00:05:10.520> but<00:05:11.110> that's<00:05:12.110> okay

00:07:58.150 --> 00:07:58.160 
but I guess that's just impossible or I

00:07:58.160 --> 00:07:59.980 
but I guess that's just impossible or I
guess<00:07:58.370> is<00:07:58.490> this<00:07:58.580> a<00:07:58.639> result<00:07:59.060> of<00:07:59.150> impossible<00:07:59.720> the

00:07:59.980 --> 00:07:59.990 
guess is this a result of impossible the

00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:01.840 
guess is this a result of impossible the
enemies<00:08:00.259> get<00:08:00.380> more<00:08:00.590> heroes<00:08:00.919> more<00:08:01.280> mana<00:08:01.490> for

00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:01.850 
enemies get more heroes more mana for

00:08:01.850 --> 00:08:04.270 
enemies get more heroes more mana for
spells<00:08:01.910> a<00:08:02.539> lot<00:08:03.440> more<00:08:03.620> of<00:08:03.680> everything<00:08:03.830> it<00:08:04.190> makes

00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:04.280 
spells a lot more of everything it makes

00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:06.460 
spells a lot more of everything it makes
things<00:08:04.490> more<00:08:04.729> challenging<00:08:05.440> but<00:08:06.440> not

00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:06.470 
things more challenging but not

00:08:06.470 --> 00:08:10.990 
things more challenging but not
challenging<00:08:07.190> enough<00:08:07.280> apparently<00:08:09.910> or<00:08:10.910> at

00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:11.000 
challenging enough apparently or at

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:16.270 
challenging enough apparently or at
least<00:08:11.030> I<00:08:11.270> think<00:08:13.000> here<00:08:14.000> we<00:08:14.120> go
