sisters<00:00:18.480> the<00:00:18.779> earth<00:00:18.960> is<00:00:19.230> changing<00:00:19.740> and<00:00:19.890> we

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
sisters the earth is changing and we

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.189 
sisters the earth is changing and we
must<00:00:20.550> alter<00:00:20.880> our<00:00:21.060> habits<00:00:21.510> before<00:00:21.689> it<00:00:21.930> is<00:00:22.020> too

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
must alter our habits before it is too

late<00:00:22.340> we<00:00:23.340> need<00:00:23.369> to<00:00:23.730> go<00:00:24.119> green<00:00:28.640> I'm<00:00:29.640> afraid<00:00:30.119> we

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
late we need to go green I'm afraid we

what<00:00:55.739> do<00:00:55.800> you<00:00:55.860> propose<00:00:56.190> we<00:00:56.460> do<00:00:56.640> we<00:00:57.390> don't<00:00:57.510> even

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
what do you propose we do we don't even

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.900 
what do you propose we do we don't even
use<00:00:57.930> electricity<00:00:58.620> there's<00:00:59.250> always<00:00:59.460> something

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
use electricity there's always something

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.650 
use electricity there's always something
you<00:00:59.940> can<00:01:00.149> do<00:01:00.329> sister<00:01:00.809> Obadiah<00:01:02.090> for<00:01:03.090> example

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
you can do sister Obadiah for example

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.060 
you can do sister Obadiah for example
how<00:01:03.809> did<00:01:03.870> you<00:01:04.019> all<00:01:04.290> get<00:01:04.470> to<00:01:04.589> this<00:01:04.710> meeting

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
how did you all get to this meeting

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.789 
how did you all get to this meeting
today<00:01:05.299> we<00:01:06.299> walked<00:01:06.630> because<00:01:07.229> we<00:01:07.380> don't<00:01:07.560> drive

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
today we walked because we don't drive

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.120 
today we walked because we don't drive
cars<00:01:08.159> so<00:01:09.000> we're<00:01:09.210> already<00:01:09.390> helping<00:01:10.140> ah<00:01:10.409> but

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
cars so we're already helping ah but

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.039 
cars so we're already helping ah but
walking<00:01:11.430> produces<00:01:12.060> friction<00:01:12.540> and<00:01:12.840> friction

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
walking produces friction and friction

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.880 
walking produces friction and friction
creates<00:01:13.890> heat<00:01:14.960> you're<00:01:15.960> careful<00:01:16.229> your<00:01:16.530> walking

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
creates heat you're careful your walking

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.320 
creates heat you're careful your walking
habits<00:01:17.280> are<00:01:17.400> raising<00:01:17.729> the<00:01:17.850> temperature<00:01:18.150> of

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
habits are raising the temperature of

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.460 
habits are raising the temperature of
the<00:01:18.509> entire<00:01:18.810> world<00:01:20.360> but<00:01:21.360> how<00:01:21.570> do<00:01:21.630> you<00:01:21.930> go<00:01:22.110> more

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
the entire world but how do you go more

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.130 
the entire world but how do you go more
green<00:01:22.979> than<00:01:23.340> walking<00:01:23.670> you<00:01:24.299> can't<00:01:24.600> well<00:01:24.930> that's

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
green than walking you can't well that's

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.140 
green than walking you can't well that's
exactly<00:01:25.320> my<00:01:25.890> points<00:01:26.460> and<00:01:26.610> no<00:01:26.729> I<00:01:26.759> mean<00:01:27.030> you

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
exactly my points and no I mean you

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.899 
exactly my points and no I mean you
can't<00:01:27.420> walk<00:01:27.720> if<00:01:28.590> we<00:01:28.829> would<00:01:28.979> stop<00:01:29.310> walking<00:01:29.790> we

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
can't walk if we would stop walking we

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.880 
can't walk if we would stop walking we
could<00:01:30.119> eliminate<00:01:30.360> point<00:01:31.020> zero<00:01:31.470> five<00:01:31.860> percent

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
could eliminate point zero five percent

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.280 
could eliminate point zero five percent
of<00:01:32.610> friction<00:01:33.000> based<00:01:33.240> heat<00:01:33.509> and<00:01:33.780> that's<00:01:34.170> a

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
of friction based heat and that's a

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.090 
of friction based heat and that's a
conservative<00:01:34.680> estimate<00:01:36.409> but<00:01:37.409> we<00:01:37.590> need<00:01:37.860> to

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
conservative estimate but we need to

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.550 
conservative estimate but we need to
walk<00:01:38.340> let<00:01:39.000> me<00:01:39.150> ask<00:01:39.329> you<00:01:39.570> something<00:01:40.020> would<00:01:40.409> you

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
walk let me ask you something would you

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.830 
walk let me ask you something would you
rather<00:01:40.770> be<00:01:40.920> able<00:01:41.130> to<00:01:41.310> walk<00:01:41.640> or<00:01:41.970> see<00:01:42.509> a<00:01:42.540> polar

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
rather be able to walk or see a polar

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.190 
rather be able to walk or see a polar

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
he makes a good point

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:52.260 
he makes a good point
but<00:01:49.689> surely<00:01:50.020> you<00:01:50.500> walked<00:01:50.770> here<00:01:51.070> today<00:01:51.520> David<00:01:52.149> I

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:52.270

fan<00:02:16.720> yourself<00:02:17.250> great<00:02:18.250> you<00:02:19.000> made<00:02:19.209> me<00:02:19.360> walk<00:02:20.489> but

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:21.489 
fan yourself great you made me walk but

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:23.970 
fan yourself great you made me walk but
why<00:02:21.670> can't<00:02:22.060> I<00:02:22.209> found<00:02:22.540> myself<00:02:22.780> climate<00:02:23.680> change

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
why can't I found myself climate change

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:25.770 
why can't I found myself climate change
we<00:02:24.370> can't<00:02:24.610> go<00:02:24.730> Fanning<00:02:25.209> ourselves

we<00:04:05.340> can<00:04:05.580> reduce<00:04:05.730> co2<00:04:06.210> emissions<00:04:06.660> by<00:04:07.230> simply

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:07.860 
we can reduce co2 emissions by simply
