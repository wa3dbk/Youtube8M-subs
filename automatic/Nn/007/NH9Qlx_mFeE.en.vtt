00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:11.720
 Hello dear masters today 

00:00:08.009 --> 00:00:17.749
 I want to show you how to make a simple 

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:18.960
 clamp clamp means as 

00:00:17.749 --> 00:00:24.289
 ribbons 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:29.069
 used packing strip 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:34.140
 it is thrown everywhere and we can 

00:00:29.069 --> 00:00:39.950
 apply it for such a clamp on Th 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:43.440
 here the first option so to speak clumsy 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:49.290
 this and claws mukhin made 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:55.079
 she made it out of the tube right here 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:01:02.960
 slotted and chopped it is just 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:05.309
 ring cloves secured with a screw 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:11.219
 here a little bit already done differently 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:18.389
 here from two sides such holes here 

00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:20.929
 the strip is passed between the body here 

00:01:18.389 --> 00:01:25.130
 this tube and handle 

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:35.119
 wooden handle milled 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:35.119
 here is such a keyway strip passes between 

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:46.200
 It means wooden this pratt street 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:52.079
 and with the hull of the tube, we make 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:57.740
 here I have already done a strip with this 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:02:00.959
 hand i'm on bending and when 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:02.180
 overlaying she will be held for 

00:02:00.959 --> 00:02:06.130
 friction count 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:11.380
 here is where the band lies on the strip and 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:16.250
 will and and hold mean second end 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:22.420
 let's sell now through this keyway 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:26.900
 show you what happens well here I am 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:32.930
 set the clamp means here is the bottom 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:38.260
 branches held by the fact that it 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:46.480
 presses it by friction second end 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:47.660
 was threaded into the keyhole and scrolling and and here 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:50.900
 hooked 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:54.500
 for any desired Zun it can still 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:59.660
 pull twisting 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:03:02.989
 hooking now a second here at 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:10.700
 stretch and even overdone tape 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:17.239
 burst though she is very solid now with 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:22.420
 of what remains to show you in order 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:26.150
 not to miss the product 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:29.739
 preferably wooden or cardboard 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:37.430
 do gasket and on it already 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:46.510
 tighten here the remnants of the tape i'm so 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:50.260
 wall and cloves are holding tape 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:50.260
 tense well 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:04:03.689
 such a clamp can anyone come in handy 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:03.689
