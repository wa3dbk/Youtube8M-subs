00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
working there's no need to change it

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.030 
working there's no need to change it
that's<00:01:05.430> another<00:01:05.670> reason<00:01:06.090> another<00:01:07.080> reason<00:01:07.920> is

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
that's another reason another reason is

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.609

I use it all the time something I really
like<00:03:41.230> about<00:03:41.260> ball<00:03:41.770> heads<00:03:42.010> is<00:03:42.310> the<00:03:42.370> fact<00:03:42.970> that

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:43.060 
like about ball heads is the fact that

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:44.670 
like about ball heads is the fact that
you<00:03:43.209> can<00:03:43.330> take<00:03:43.510> your<00:03:43.630> camera<00:03:44.020> and<00:03:44.260> you<00:03:44.650> can

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:44.680 
you can take your camera and you can

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:46.830 
you can take your camera and you can
drop<00:03:45.010> it<00:03:45.190> into<00:03:45.340> the<00:03:45.520> mounts<00:03:46.120> and<00:03:46.390> it<00:03:46.600> locks

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:46.840 
drop it into the mounts and it locks

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:48.660 
drop it into the mounts and it locks
down<00:03:47.020> so<00:03:47.980> if<00:03:48.070> I'm<00:03:48.160> going<00:03:48.250> to<00:03:48.340> show<00:03:48.459> you<00:03:48.489> this

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:48.670 
down so if I'm going to show you this

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:51.930 
down so if I'm going to show you this
again<00:03:49.320> with<00:03:50.320> this<00:03:50.530> facing<00:03:51.340> the<00:03:51.430> camera<00:03:51.760> maybe

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:51.940 
again with this facing the camera maybe

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:54.540 
again with this facing the camera maybe
you<00:03:52.060> can<00:03:52.209> see<00:03:52.390> this<00:03:52.510> a<00:03:52.570> little<00:03:52.750> bit<00:03:52.930> better

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:54.550 
you can see this a little bit better

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:58.320 
you can see this a little bit better
towards<00:03:55.330> me<00:03:55.510> comes<00:03:56.500> in<00:03:56.680> like<00:03:56.830> this<00:03:57.070> in<00:03:57.940> a<00:03:58.090> walks

00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:58.330 
towards me comes in like this in a walks

00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:59.910 
towards me comes in like this in a walks
down<00:03:58.600> this<00:03:58.810> is<00:03:58.960> a<00:03:58.990> safety<00:03:59.260> switch<00:03:59.530> we'll<00:03:59.800> lock

00:03:59.910 --> 00:03:59.920 
down this is a safety switch we'll lock

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:02.040 
down this is a safety switch we'll lock
that<00:04:00.100> into<00:04:00.340> position<00:04:00.460> so<00:04:01.300> this<00:04:01.480> is<00:04:01.600> going<00:04:01.900> to

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:02.050 
that into position so this is going to

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:03.900 
that into position so this is going to
allow<00:04:02.290> us<00:04:02.320> to<00:04:02.560> move<00:04:02.860> the<00:04:03.010> camera<00:04:03.220> around<00:04:03.460> and

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:03.910 
allow us to move the camera around and

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:07.170 
allow us to move the camera around and
to<00:04:04.900> lock<00:04:05.110> it<00:04:05.320> into<00:04:05.710> different<00:04:05.980> positions<00:04:06.250> very

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:07.180 
to lock it into different positions very

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:10.830 
to lock it into different positions very
quickly<00:04:07.540> and<00:04:07.900> very<00:04:07.930> effectively<00:04:09.840> eventually

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:10.840 
quickly and very effectively eventually

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:12.480 
quickly and very effectively eventually
there's<00:04:11.110> gonna<00:04:11.200> come<00:04:11.320> a<00:04:11.500> point<00:04:11.590> when<00:04:12.100> you

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:12.490 
there's gonna come a point when you

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:31.810 
want to consider this little guy called

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:34.290 
want to consider this little guy called
a<00:04:32.020> Joby<00:04:32.560> Gorillapod<00:04:32.590> and<00:04:33.490> there<00:04:33.880> are<00:04:34.000> some<00:04:34.150> off

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:34.300 
a Joby Gorillapod and there are some off

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:37.230 
a Joby Gorillapod and there are some off
brands<00:04:34.780> but<00:04:34.900> I<00:04:34.960> typically<00:04:35.680> buy<00:04:35.820> these<00:04:36.820> from

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:37.240 
brands but I typically buy these from

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:39.840 
brands but I typically buy these from
Joby<00:04:37.660> themselves<00:04:38.200> it's<00:04:38.380> a<00:04:38.470> mini<00:04:38.650> tripod<00:04:38.950> and

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:39.850 
Joby themselves it's a mini tripod and

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:41.730 
Joby themselves it's a mini tripod and
obviously<00:04:40.240> it's<00:04:40.420> not<00:04:40.480> gonna<00:04:40.660> work<00:04:40.960> for<00:04:41.020> a<00:04:41.470> big

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:41.740 
obviously it's not gonna work for a big

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:44.000 
obviously it's not gonna work for a big
camera<00:04:42.040> a<00:04:42.190> big<00:04:42.370> SLR<00:04:42.880> but<00:04:42.910> I<00:04:43.150> do<00:04:43.270> a<00:04:43.390> lot<00:04:43.690> of

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:44.010 
camera a big SLR but I do a lot of

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:46.110 
camera a big SLR but I do a lot of
point-and-shoot<00:04:45.010> photography<00:04:45.640> and<00:04:45.880> this

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:46.120 
point-and-shoot photography and this

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:50.580 
point-and-shoot photography and this
allows<00:04:46.480> you<00:04:47.460> to<00:04:48.690> attach<00:04:49.690> a<00:04:49.990> miniature

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:50.590 
allows you to attach a miniature

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:53.760 
allows you to attach a miniature
portable<00:04:51.520> tripod<00:04:52.170> to<00:04:53.170> your<00:04:53.320> point<00:04:53.560> and<00:04:53.710> shoot

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:53.770 
portable tripod to your point and shoot

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:56.910 
portable tripod to your point and shoot
and<00:04:54.340> then<00:04:54.730> you<00:04:55.510> can<00:04:55.660> use<00:04:55.840> it<00:04:55.990> to<00:04:56.140> to<00:04:56.500> like<00:04:56.650> kind

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:56.920 
and then you can use it to to like kind

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:58.680 
and then you can use it to to like kind
of<00:04:56.980> grab<00:04:57.190> on<00:04:57.400> to<00:04:57.580> stuff<00:04:57.880> I<00:04:58.150> mean<00:04:58.540> they're

00:04:58.680 --> 00:04:58.690 
of grab on to stuff I mean they're

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:02.100 
of grab on to stuff I mean they're
really<00:04:58.950> quite<00:04:59.950> adaptable<00:05:00.669> and<00:05:01.270> they're

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:02.110 
really quite adaptable and they're

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:04.350 
really quite adaptable and they're
pretty<00:05:02.290> reliable<00:05:02.460> so<00:05:03.460> you<00:05:03.550> could<00:05:03.790> go<00:05:04.060> out<00:05:04.180> and

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:04.360 
pretty reliable so you could go out and

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:05.730 
pretty reliable so you could go out and
take<00:05:04.450> a<00:05:04.510> picture<00:05:04.900> of<00:05:04.930> something<00:05:05.320> you<00:05:05.560> know<00:05:05.680> if
