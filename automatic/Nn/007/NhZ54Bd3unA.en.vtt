00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:57.729 
and you just draw like that and I can

00:01:57.729 --> 00:01:59.190 
and you just draw like that and I can
just<00:01:57.880> undo<00:01:58.210> what<00:01:58.329> I<00:01:58.390> just<00:01:58.570> did<00:01:58.780> because<00:01:59.020> it

00:01:59.190 --> 00:01:59.200 
just undo what I just did because it

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.099 
just undo what I just did because it
doesn't<00:01:59.439> look<00:01:59.500> very<00:01:59.710> nice<00:02:00.329> and<00:02:01.329> I<00:02:01.420> can<00:02:01.600> do<00:02:02.079> a

00:02:02.099 --> 00:02:02.109 
doesn't look very nice and I can do a

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:05.459 
doesn't look very nice and I can do a
little<00:02:02.350> squiggle<00:02:02.590> I<00:02:02.710> had<00:02:02.829> earlier<00:02:03.130> there<00:02:04.469> and

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:05.469 
little squiggle I had earlier there and

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:07.469 
little squiggle I had earlier there and
it<00:02:05.649> says<00:02:05.859> to<00:02:06.159> see<00:02:06.280> all<00:02:06.399> note<00:02:06.579> all<00:02:06.850> pages<00:02:07.210> in<00:02:07.420> the

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
so if I want to move a page around like

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:22.559 
so if I want to move a page around like
that<00:02:20.829> I<00:02:21.129> can<00:02:21.610> move<00:02:21.700> it<00:02:21.819> out<00:02:21.879> wherever<00:02:22.090> I<00:02:22.329> want

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:22.569

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:24.449 
that I can move it out wherever I want
and<00:02:22.719> this<00:02:23.049> also<00:02:23.379> once<00:02:23.590> works<00:02:23.890> a<00:02:23.950> good<00:02:24.069> finger<00:02:24.310> -

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:24.459 
and this also once works a good finger -

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:26.160 
and this also once works a good finger -
I'm<00:02:24.939> just<00:02:25.150> using<00:02:25.359> a<00:02:25.450> stylus<00:02:25.840> because<00:02:25.900> I<00:02:26.109> think

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
I'm just using a stylus because I think

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:27.569 
I'm just using a stylus because I think
the<00:02:26.409> stylus<00:02:26.739> really<00:02:26.980> goes<00:02:27.099> well<00:02:27.310> with<00:02:27.370> this

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:27.579 
the stylus really goes well with this

00:02:27.579 --> 00:02:31.770 
the stylus really goes well with this
app<00:02:27.840> and<00:02:29.430> says<00:02:30.430> touch<00:02:30.849> my<00:02:31.060> notebooks<00:02:31.450> to<00:02:31.659> make

00:03:33.899 --> 00:03:33.909 
of app um I just did test it like John

00:03:33.909 --> 00:03:35.610 
of app um I just did test it like John
with<00:03:34.000> my<00:03:34.120> finger<00:03:34.479> hi<00:03:34.930> you're<00:03:35.139> watching<00:03:35.229> tea

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:35.620 
with my finger hi you're watching tea

game<00:03:35.799> text<00:03:36.190> subscribe<00:03:36.549> and<00:03:37.389> this<00:03:37.870> is<00:03:38.019> with<00:03:38.169> my

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:38.290 
game text subscribe and this is with my

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:40.439 
game text subscribe and this is with my
stylus<00:03:38.739> and<00:03:39.010> I<00:03:39.430> just<00:03:39.790> think<00:03:39.849> this<00:03:39.970> Alice<00:03:40.329> is

00:03:40.439 --> 00:03:40.449 
stylus and I just think this Alice is

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:46.319 
stylus and I just think this Alice is
easier<00:03:40.780> writing<00:03:41.139> than<00:03:42.069> with<00:03:42.190> my<00:03:42.310> finger<00:03:45.329> the

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:46.329

plain<00:03:52.150> notebook<00:03:52.569> paper<00:03:52.829> if<00:03:53.829> you<00:03:53.889> change<00:03:54.250> the

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:54.489 
plain notebook paper if you change the

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:57.089 
plain notebook paper if you change the
paper<00:03:54.699> it<00:03:55.120> changes<00:03:55.540> the<00:03:55.629> whole<00:03:55.659> notebook<00:03:56.099> um

00:03:57.089 --> 00:03:57.099 
paper it changes the whole notebook um

00:03:57.099 --> 00:03:58.319 
paper it changes the whole notebook um
you<00:03:57.310> might<00:03:57.459> not<00:03:57.579> even<00:03:57.609> see<00:03:57.819> the<00:03:57.940> graph<00:03:58.120> you

00:03:58.319 --> 00:03:58.329 
you might not even see the graph you

00:03:58.329 --> 00:03:59.550 
you might not even see the graph you
might<00:03:58.510> see<00:03:58.780> the<00:03:58.870> graph<00:03:59.049> a<00:03:59.169> little<00:03:59.260> bit<00:03:59.409> there

00:03:59.550 --> 00:03:59.560 
might see the graph a little bit there

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:03.000 
might see the graph a little bit there
but<00:03:59.590> that<00:03:59.859> gets<00:03:59.979> plain<00:04:00.310> paper<00:04:01.319> line<00:04:02.319> paper<00:04:02.650> and

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:03.010 
but that gets plain paper line paper and

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:04.530 
but that gets plain paper line paper and
it<00:04:03.189> changes<00:04:03.729> for<00:04:03.879> the<00:04:03.939> whole<00:04:04.030> notebook<00:04:04.239> not

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:04.540 
it changes for the whole notebook not

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:06.210 
it changes for the whole notebook not
just<00:04:04.720> a<00:04:04.810> page<00:04:05.049> so<00:04:05.620> if<00:04:05.680> you'd<00:04:05.799> be<00:04:05.889> able<00:04:05.949> to<00:04:06.069> just

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:06.220 
just a page so if you'd be able to just

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:07.649 
just a page so if you'd be able to just
take<00:04:06.400> one<00:04:06.639> page<00:04:06.879> make<00:04:07.120> it<00:04:07.239> into<00:04:07.389> a<00:04:07.419> graph<00:04:07.629> that

00:04:07.649 --> 00:04:07.659 
take one page make it into a graph that

00:04:07.659 --> 00:04:09.750 
take one page make it into a graph that
be<00:04:07.959> nicer<00:04:08.319> give<00:04:08.829> you<00:04:08.949> a<00:04:08.979> pin<00:04:09.189> like<00:04:09.310> notes<00:04:09.579> and

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:09.760 
be nicer give you a pin like notes and

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:10.710 
be nicer give you a pin like notes and
then<00:04:09.849> you<00:04:09.879> just<00:04:10.060> want<00:04:10.209> to<00:04:10.269> put<00:04:10.359> one<00:04:10.510> graph

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:10.720 
then you just want to put one graph

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:12.030 
then you just want to put one graph
instead<00:04:10.930> of<00:04:11.109> mean<00:04:11.199> the<00:04:11.319> whole<00:04:11.470> notebook<00:04:11.859> is<00:04:12.010> a
