00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:48.040 
I usually crush them dislocated and

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:49.950 
I usually crush them dislocated and
that's<00:04:48.190> it<00:04:48.400> makes<00:04:48.669> a<00:04:48.760> lot<00:04:48.850> more<00:04:49.060> room<00:04:49.270> there

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:49.960 
that's it makes a lot more room there

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:51.810 
that's it makes a lot more room there
are<00:04:50.230> stores<00:04:50.950> like<00:04:51.220> let's<00:04:51.400> say<00:04:51.490> in<00:04:51.580> New<00:04:51.669> York
