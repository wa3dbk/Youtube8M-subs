00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
alright decided that the LED here if we

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.990 
alright decided that the LED here if we
knock<00:01:00.960> twice<00:01:01.170> that<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.250> pattern<00:01:02.460> of<00:01:02.670> change

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
knock twice that the pattern of change

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.649 
knock twice that the pattern of change
this<00:01:03.870> led<00:01:04.199> that<00:01:05.189> means<00:01:05.400> is<00:01:05.549> a<00:01:05.580> greedy<00:01:06.090> mr.

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659

conduct is an ios and android

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.700 
conduct is an ios and android
application<00:01:38.100> yes<00:01:38.460> enjoy<00:01:39.500> such<00:01:40.500> gray

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
application yes enjoy such gray

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.590 
application yes enjoy such gray
semantics<00:01:41.220> here<00:01:41.430> see<00:01:41.909> all<00:01:42.090> of<00:01:42.270> this

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
semantics here see all of this

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.410 
semantics here see all of this
information<00:01:43.560> basically<00:01:44.430> turn<00:01:44.850> so<00:01:45.060> this<00:01:45.270> is

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
information basically turn so this is

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.410 
information basically turn so this is
the<00:01:45.600> speak<00:01:46.229> engine<00:01:46.920> temperature<00:01:47.729> releases

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
the speak engine temperature releases

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.859 
the speak engine temperature releases
energy<00:01:48.810> temperature<00:01:49.530> power<00:01:50.509> then<00:01:51.509> this<00:01:51.720> is<00:01:51.840> a

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
energy temperature power then this is a

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:55.760 
energy temperature power then this is a
time<00:01:52.290> connector<00:01:53.159> yeah<00:01:54.000> here<00:01:54.689> if<00:01:54.840> we<00:01:54.869> we<00:01:55.530> go<00:01:55.710> to

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
time connector yeah here if we we go to

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.800 
time connector yeah here if we we go to
this<00:01:56.070> money<00:01:56.340> also<00:01:56.579> a<00:01:56.729> lot<00:01:56.939> of<00:01:57.090> information<00:01:57.659> it

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
this money also a lot of information it

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.039 
this money also a lot of information it
provides<00:01:58.340> vehicle<00:01:59.340> battery<00:01:59.850> level<00:02:00.210> all<00:02:00.810> the

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
provides vehicle battery level all the

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:04.120 
provides vehicle battery level all the
stuff<00:02:01.430> so<00:02:02.430> like<00:02:02.670> setting<00:02:03.360> light<00:02:03.570> settings

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.130 
stuff so like setting light settings

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:09.010 
stuff so like setting light settings
then<00:02:05.130> we<00:02:05.310> can<00:02:05.579> change<00:02:06.079> like<00:02:07.079> material

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:09.020 
then we can change like material

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:14.080 
then we can change like material
then<00:02:09.680> chance<00:02:10.100> to<00:02:10.400> model<00:02:11.030> of<00:02:11.300> wall<00:02:11.990> then<00:02:13.090> for

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
then chance to model of wall then for

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:17.770 
then chance to model of wall then for
the<00:02:14.180> time<00:02:14.480> song<00:02:16.090> disk<00:02:17.090> and<00:02:17.330> things<00:02:17.570> and

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
colorful reckoner then I think we can

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.390 
colorful reckoner then I think we can
select<00:02:22.250> like<00:02:22.730> a<00:02:23.060> different<00:02:23.810> place<00:02:24.740> every<00:02:24.890> time
