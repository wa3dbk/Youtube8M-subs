00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:09.530
 video in many thousands of years but it's 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:12.929
 I'm in the end, it's already something 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:15.000
 complicated to record and edit and upload it and 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.770
 also be doing all the emmys 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.800
 final not of my exams my works 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.900
 but it's almost over so, very soon 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.880
 I could upload many videos I'm 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.220
 making this short video for 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:31.500

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:34.829

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:38.940
 normal the truth I'm very happy very 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:41.850
 grateful to you and if it is something very 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.680
 strange to try to understand that 15 thousand 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:47.460
 people want to see my videos again 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:49.140
 and yeah well I think we 're already more than 15 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.789
 I'm not sure but whatever 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.010
 any number for me impresses me 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.829
 a lot and I'm a bit afraid to know that 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.690
 So many of you but fine me 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.210
