in the springtime mid-april May into the
beginning<00:00:06.330> of<00:00:06.420> June<00:00:06.859> we<00:00:07.859> come<00:00:08.490> and<00:00:08.670> we<00:00:08.730> do

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
beginning of June we come and we do

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:10.490 
beginning of June we come and we do
what's<00:00:09.210> called<00:00:09.300> suckering<00:00:09.840> in<00:00:10.050> the<00:00:10.230> vineyard

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
what's called suckering in the vineyard

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.379 
what's called suckering in the vineyard
the<00:00:10.590> other<00:00:10.800> term<00:00:11.580> for<00:00:11.849> it<00:00:11.940> would<00:00:12.059> be<00:00:12.090> chute

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
the other term for it would be chute

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:14.690 
the other term for it would be chute
thinning<00:00:12.719> so<00:00:13.440> what<00:00:13.590> we<00:00:13.710> do<00:00:13.860> is<00:00:13.950> we<00:00:14.070> come<00:00:14.280> in<00:00:14.460> and

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
thinning so what we do is we come in and

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.010 
thinning so what we do is we come in and
have<00:00:15.330> the<00:00:15.540> vine<00:00:16.369> Devine<00:00:17.369> has<00:00:17.580> grown<00:00:18.180> and<00:00:18.510> it's

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
have the vine Devine has grown and it's

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.519 
have the vine Devine has grown and it's
a<00:00:19.800> lot<00:00:20.369> of<00:00:20.550> dormant<00:00:21.270> buds<00:00:21.420> along<00:00:21.930> the<00:00:22.109> trunk

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
a lot of dormant buds along the trunk

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.859 
a lot of dormant buds along the trunk
along<00:00:22.830> the<00:00:23.100> cordon<00:00:23.519> have<00:00:23.760> pushed<00:00:24.119> so<00:00:24.539> we<00:00:24.660> come

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
along the cordon have pushed so we come

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.830 
along the cordon have pushed so we come
through<00:00:24.900> and<00:00:25.410> we<00:00:25.529> take<00:00:25.740> them<00:00:25.949> off<00:00:26.160> and<00:00:26.840> we

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
through and we take them off and we

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.650 
through and we take them off and we
refocus<00:00:28.560> the<00:00:28.769> vines<00:00:29.250> energy<00:00:29.820> into<00:00:30.210> what<00:00:30.570> we

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
refocus the vines energy into what we

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.900 
refocus the vines energy into what we
left<00:00:30.840> as<00:00:31.019> far<00:00:31.170> as<00:00:31.260> pruning<00:00:31.470> which<00:00:32.070> we<00:00:32.279> want<00:00:32.489> to

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
left as far as pruning which we want to

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.090 
left as far as pruning which we want to
shoot<00:00:33.180> spur<00:00:33.540> spur<00:00:33.930> so<00:00:34.500> what<00:00:34.649> we're<00:00:34.800> trying<00:00:34.920> to

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
shoot spur spur so what we're trying to

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.709 
shoot spur spur so what we're trying to
create<00:00:35.280> in<00:00:35.520> the<00:00:35.640> vine<00:00:35.820> is<00:00:36.090> we're<00:00:36.270> trying<00:00:36.480> to

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
create in the vine is we're trying to

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:41.030 
create in the vine is we're trying to
create<00:00:37.550> windows<00:00:38.550> in<00:00:38.850> the<00:00:39.420> plant<00:00:39.860> along<00:00:40.860> the

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
create windows in the plant along the

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.180 
create windows in the plant along the
cord<00:00:41.280> on<00:00:41.570> the<00:00:42.570> windows<00:00:42.899> that<00:00:43.260> the<00:00:43.469> air<00:00:43.620> it<00:00:43.950> will

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
cord on the windows that the air it will

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.889 
cord on the windows that the air it will
allow<00:00:44.399> air<00:00:44.640> movement<00:00:45.149> through<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:45.719> vine

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
allow air movement through the vine

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.049 
allow air movement through the vine
better<00:00:46.200> air<00:00:46.410> flow<00:00:46.670> which<00:00:47.670> will<00:00:47.850> aid<00:00:48.000> in

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
better air flow which will aid in

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.350 
better air flow which will aid in
disease<00:00:49.050> prevention<00:00:49.079> and<00:00:49.980> the<00:00:50.489> other<00:00:50.670> benefit

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
disease prevention and the other benefit

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.330 
disease prevention and the other benefit
to<00:00:51.750> during<00:00:52.260> this<00:00:52.350> practice<00:00:52.800> of<00:00:52.949> setting<00:00:53.250> out

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
to during this practice of setting out

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.389 
to during this practice of setting out
the<00:00:53.370> shoes<00:00:53.760> is<00:00:54.230> that<00:00:55.230> we<00:00:55.379> get<00:00:55.590> filtered<00:00:55.980> light

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
the shoes is that we get filtered light

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.750 
the shoes is that we get filtered light
that<00:00:56.910> is<00:00:57.300> able<00:00:57.600> to<00:00:57.859> hit<00:00:58.859> the<00:00:59.010> clusters<00:00:59.430> and

that is able to hit the clusters and

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.119 
that is able to hit the clusters and
allow<00:01:00.180> for<00:01:00.449> better<00:01:00.870> color<00:01:01.199> development<00:01:01.500> and

particular we've had to come through and

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.069 
particular we've had to come through and
many<00:01:44.520> of<00:01:44.670> the<00:01:44.790> blocks<00:01:44.909> and<00:01:45.210> do<00:01:45.329> this<00:01:45.450> twice<00:01:45.750> so

many of the blocks and do this twice so

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:49.249 
many of the blocks and do this twice so
the<00:01:46.799> first<00:01:47.430> time<00:01:47.640> we<00:01:47.759> come<00:01:47.939> through<00:01:48.240> we<00:01:49.110> come

the first time we come through we come

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.999 
the first time we come through we come
through<00:01:49.290> fairly<00:01:49.770> early<00:01:49.950> and<00:01:50.369> then<00:01:51.270> we<00:01:51.780> we<00:01:52.619> take

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
through fairly early and then we we take

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.100 
through fairly early and then we we take
off<00:01:53.220> what's<00:01:53.909> growing<00:01:54.270> in<00:01:54.509> places<00:01:54.899> that<00:01:54.930> it

that plant can carry so many clusters

handling we have to come through and we

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
have to take this off so again we're

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.170 
have to take this off so again we're
