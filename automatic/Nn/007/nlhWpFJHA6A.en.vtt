00:00:01.779 --> 00:00:05.660
 we are a large part of the first half because the first half 

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:08.759
 There is actually nothing to experience in the long-distance 

00:00:08.759 --> 00:00:12.789
 Rotterdam has eleven local team struggling to make it into the game at home 

00:00:12.789 --> 00:00:16.919
 also against those goals weekends then skimming backwards 

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:21.039
 with a bit of luck the ball comes to him the right to turn out once 

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:25.259
 the passenger car is a 0 for veendam there 

00:00:27.569 --> 00:00:31.219
 it actually nothing to do with a good football because through a co player 

00:00:31.219 --> 00:00:31.920
 often 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.220
 the ball ends up with him 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:38.070
 You know what to do with this kind of side street coaches you can have no chance 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:38.580
 to mention 

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:42.350
 He does score him in the Veendam attacker, so joy also in the 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:44.360
 trainer of veendam joop gall 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:47.360
 that overall a lot in the first half not so much to enjoy 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:49.660
 his own on the long empty 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:53.450
 if they see one more often now it is called to halt, it must go back 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:59.120
 badly defending the side of coby bulls rozema a true club neighbor 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.420
 the shot is about practical teak 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:05.170
 for the first half on the Veendam side also for Cody Ross Walter Seib 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:07.030
 not too much of an actor either 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:08.720
 then the second half 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.700
 or I can expect more, but yes, few attack activities 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:17.630
 well no creativity at all the same goes for the guests from deventer 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:20.920
 Still the lead for Veendam a wilders by a goal 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:22.880
 from him 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.190
 alternate with that objective 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:29.880
 has entered the field and he then gets the ball of stroke and who is turk 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.700
 dangerous dangerous cijntje kick in the movement of course 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:33.850
 with the bet 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:37.400
 the shot goes just past the post that the post comes to the second post 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:38.890
 just the last 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.890
 good looking was that for a choir that couples 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:43.450
 robur meijer 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:47.230
 towards him, the most dangerous man on the Veendam side 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:50.930
 spread a corner here too for the peat colonials 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:55.920
 often passed the co goalkeeper in that veendam a few years ago 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.360
 So now the co goalkeeper was interested 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.800
 of course, the chance of not having the score is not possible, of course 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:05.200
 are from on his foot 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.690
 I don't have to sit and get this 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:09.389
 the response from them 

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:10.509
 by us 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:11.869
 she then 

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:15.909
 they also get plenty of time and space for the players to play around 

00:02:15.909 --> 00:02:19.579
 so there is no pressure on the ball and the space is found 

00:02:19.579 --> 00:02:20.829
 this idea is 

00:02:20.829 --> 00:02:24.360
 You come out well its purpose it now ensures that agfa oil 

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:26.889
 cannot make the equalizer 

00:02:26.889 --> 00:02:30.089
 emails came in the field on the side of veendam a kind of thing case 

00:02:30.089 --> 00:02:32.840
 for more creativity you can find the polak here 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.549
 is nicely ready for polak 50 meters 

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:38.089
 he does not yet have a clear view 

00:02:38.089 --> 00:02:41.089
 he is not yet lucky in the Veendam shirt 

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:44.319
 the oil company 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:48.319
 looking for the owner I make the post long attacker but good 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:52.739
 ready for halo who doesn't find it so first co often close 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:55.739
 the one against one 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:01.669
 veendam through him one is already bothered by his groin and his at that time 

00:03:01.669 --> 00:03:02.339
 hamstring 

00:03:02.339 --> 00:03:05.139
 there is still a free kick through a stop 

00:03:05.139 --> 00:03:08.539
 in front of veendam pasveer the wall is kidnapped by the man behind the ball 

00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:10.869
 that track active and has a good kick 

00:03:10.869 --> 00:03:14.319
 however, this commitment goes without a chance in addition to the goal of pasveer 

00:03:16.499 --> 00:03:20.879
 he is now less out on the side of veendam first by us 

00:03:21.939 --> 00:03:26.139
 bosco not with and then the ball that lands on march just like the old 

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:29.419
 international on the side of dead hedgehogs his team too eager 

00:03:29.419 --> 00:03:33.329
 it is a characteristic the overmars action in the past he was there 

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:36.039
 was not too dangerous 

00:03:36.039 --> 00:03:39.189
 to go six minutes 

00:03:39.189 --> 00:03:42.999
 next to him back to loohuis trying to find the attack 

00:03:42.999 --> 00:03:45.920
 put that seems to be smothering here but poorly defended 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:49.569
 by zaandam lola house after polak from 18 meters 

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:51.700
 via a video of Zuidland 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:54.780
 Celtic ball over pass a 2 0 for Veendam 

00:03:55.499 --> 00:03:56.819
 it's nice to see 

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:59.949
 joy the eagerness with polak 

00:03:59.949 --> 00:04:03.359
 now he is lucky enough to get through scyedam 

00:04:03.359 --> 00:04:06.730
 gets the beam norm a try, he still passes over pasveer 

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:13.180
 the king once again did not reach rozema in the final stage 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:14.989
 zuidam 

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:18.969
 after all, a real man with his thumb sings a good 30-meter shot 

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:21.540
 as god it just goes wrong 

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:26.590
 so Veendam does not earn those goals playing time well with 2 0 from co 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:30.059
 but grabbed the points and that is the most important thing 

00:04:30.059 --> 00:04:34.549
 and so it is a party to the long emptiness and all under the leadership of the 

00:04:34.549 --> 00:04:35.930
 midfield controller 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:37.040
 not loohuis
