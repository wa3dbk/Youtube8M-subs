00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:08.790
 One more gadget on the net today let's talk 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.620
 a lens for iPhone do not know 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.080
 iphone take very cool pics a lot 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.179
 Nice, but when I take some photos I can 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:18.060
 read the instagram and several people like that 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.900
 arrived to tell me about this photo with effect 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.330
 everything better 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.580
 there are applications that make several 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.460
 but you can also place 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.949
 A lens in the sky is your iphone as a 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:32.430
 or for example this clip is very 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:34.230
 she has three differentials which is the 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.390
 fish eye right 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.910
 the ' a ' tab of that mean effect 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.070
 rounded here on the side and in the center it 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.870
 accents is very cool 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.090
 Also the maxi pear was well 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.730
 and then you give the details of the 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.160
 door and if it really is impressive and 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.590
 white hubble that is for you to increase 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.510
 angle of the photo you can capture more 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.670
 here on the sides as a professional 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.820
 doctor then let's show this with more 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.859
 details now its personal this is it 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.409
 then it is the box of the net profit of the 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:07.320
 lens is the one from here is for iphone 5 is 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:10.110

 here is a red model has also 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.409
 other colors as I have said is to have a 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.540
 fish eye effect or by having to 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:21.869
 to attack them understand the eye effect of 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.560
 fish was made macro and the effect haiti 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.180
 Angola 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:29.340
 Let's open it so we'll even 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:33.750
 selling the box comes the normal manual ne 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:37.320
 there is not much that matters the lens in 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:39.270
 yes that's where the animal gets and a 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.490
 bag to transport you to 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.710
 You take someplace else to carry 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.790
 more securely so as not to damage the 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.220
 lens right 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:50.100
 she has the cap the caps here 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:53.040
 pixar lens and other two edition 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:55.710
 lenses and this is an adapter for 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.210
 has ipods is fifth generation 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.060
 if you want to use the ipod too 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.750
 thickens the ipod to her if she fits 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.360
 right 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.159
 so we fit here on the side in 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.969
 dog that is already embedded 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:09.209
 capped 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:11.180
 We take the cap off. 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:13.099
 Look how the effect is 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:16.099
 It's cool, he gets a lot from my 

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:17.840
 hand if you will see that she is well 

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:19.730
 distant is that it looks where it is in 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.329
 being captured by the 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:22.129
 screen 

00:02:20.329 --> 00:02:24.079
 just for you to have a base how much 

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:26.120
 she takes very much I'm going to take 

00:02:24.079 --> 00:02:28.519
 now that you can see what she was going to 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:30.469
 really take it so that the 

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:33.319
 difference does not have a monitor does not have 

00:02:30.469 --> 00:02:35.629
 nothing when you put the camera here 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:38.510
 Look, she really does. 

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:41.030
 more're good thing that this is a 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:43.849
 side of the bed now let's move on to the 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:47.870
 the other side is just inverting here ó inverted 

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:50.450
 took that's the angle was almost 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:52.970
 fish eye without that bulging effect 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:54.530
 that comes no effect means 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:56.840
 twisted here on the side 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:03:00.739
 So I'll take it for you. See, it's here. 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:03.889
 with the ego she looks like she really 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:07.069
 magnifies the angle of the lens here 

00:03:03.889 --> 00:03:10.340
 original of the spanta and for us to use the 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:13.549
 makro we take people take the lens off 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:16.609
 I think we'll take it here. 

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:18.349
 and now it 's makro let's get this one 

00:03:16.609 --> 00:03:18.829
 Japanese cookie, let's do the 

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:20.569
 test 

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:22.940
 You're going to see her 

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:24.909
 well it is well supported by far, but when 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:28.069
 comes very close or close to there 

00:03:24.909 --> 00:03:31.040
 You can take a macro shot yourself 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:34.340
 it's very accurate in the details will pick up 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:38.629
 a nice detail of the texture that the 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:41.509
 plastic was there she makes pictures of things 

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:43.459
 very small we will use the 

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:47.780
 own lens even though you can 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:49.699
 take a ball looks at the fire of the 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:51.439

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:56.440
 You really can not take pictures. 

00:03:51.439 --> 00:04:00.190
