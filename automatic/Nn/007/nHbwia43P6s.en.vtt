I've been in it for 20 years I've seen

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.940 
I've been in it for 20 years I've seen
an<00:01:48.210> up<00:01:48.329> and<00:01:48.569> a<00:01:48.630> low<00:01:48.810> and<00:01:49.140> now<00:01:49.590> we're<00:01:49.770> on<00:01:49.859> the

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
an up and a low and now we're on the

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.130 
an up and a low and now we're on the
upstream<00:01:50.280> again<00:01:50.579> and<00:01:50.789> we<00:01:51.539> got<00:01:51.659> a<00:01:51.689> new<00:01:51.869> track

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
upstream again and we got a new track

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.289 
upstream again and we got a new track
growing<00:01:52.740> in<00:01:52.859> balzac<00:01:53.310> but<00:01:53.700> supposed<00:01:53.999> to<00:01:54.090> be<00:01:54.210> by

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
growing in balzac but supposed to be by

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.989 
growing in balzac but supposed to be by
2007<00:01:55.170> so<00:01:55.859> right<00:01:56.100> there's<00:01:56.399> you<00:01:56.759> know<00:01:56.789> his

00:01:56.989 --> 00:01:56.999 
2007 so right there's you know his

00:01:56.999 --> 00:01:58.669 
2007 so right there's you know his
reason<00:01:57.390> to<00:01:57.509> believe<00:01:57.749> that<00:01:57.899> it's<00:01:58.200> going<00:01:58.409> on<00:01:58.560> the

00:01:58.669 --> 00:01:58.679 
reason to believe that it's going on the

00:01:58.679 --> 00:02:01.789 
reason to believe that it's going on the
upswing<00:01:58.920> a<00:01:59.219> lot<00:02:00.090> happens<00:02:00.569> before<00:02:00.810> and<00:02:01.319> after

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
upswing a lot happens before and after

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.950 
upswing a lot happens before and after
the<00:02:01.950> actual<00:02:02.399> race<00:02:02.639> at<00:02:02.909> the<00:02:02.939> track<00:02:03.149> so<00:02:03.689> towns

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
the actual race at the track so towns

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.510 
the actual race at the track so towns
and<00:02:04.229> then<00:02:04.350> the<00:02:04.469> other<00:02:04.619> students<00:02:05.039> get<00:02:05.189> a<00:02:05.219> broad

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
and then the other students get a broad

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.480 
and then the other students get a broad
base<00:02:05.789> of<00:02:05.850> training<00:02:06.509> in<00:02:06.630> the<00:02:06.749> equine<00:02:07.139> world

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
life yeah the racetrack it's kind of an

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.520 
life yeah the racetrack it's kind of an
industry<00:02:24.819> we<00:02:24.969> just<00:02:25.180> do<00:02:25.359> it<00:02:25.480> the<00:02:25.510> old<00:02:25.719> way<00:02:25.810> but

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
industry we just do it the old way but

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:27.720 
industry we just do it the old way but
it's<00:02:26.680> kind<00:02:27.010> of<00:02:27.040> they're<00:02:27.189> gonna<00:02:27.280> be<00:02:27.430> the<00:02:27.549> new

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
it's kind of they're gonna be the new

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:29.460 
it's kind of they're gonna be the new
way<00:02:27.879> so<00:02:27.939> hopefully<00:02:28.359> it<00:02:28.420> goes<00:02:28.540> over<00:02:28.750> well<00:02:29.019> and<00:02:29.260> I

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
way so hopefully it goes over well and I

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:31.349 
way so hopefully it goes over well and I
think<00:02:29.769> we<00:02:30.159> have<00:02:30.189> a<00:02:30.310> good<00:02:30.519> group<00:02:30.730> of<00:02:31.030> kids<00:02:31.090> that

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:31.359 
think we have a good group of kids that

00:02:31.359 --> 00:02:32.940 
think we have a good group of kids that
are<00:02:31.540> gonna<00:02:31.629> be<00:02:31.720> able<00:02:31.989> to<00:02:32.140> open<00:02:32.349> some<00:02:32.500> eyes<00:02:32.620> and

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
are gonna be able to open some eyes and

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:34.410 
are gonna be able to open some eyes and
see<00:02:33.159> that<00:02:33.340> not<00:02:33.760> everything<00:02:34.000> has<00:02:34.120> to<00:02:34.269> be<00:02:34.359> done

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
see that not everything has to be done

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.210 
see that not everything has to be done
the<00:02:34.659> old<00:02:34.780> way<00:02:34.930> definitely<00:02:35.769> looking<00:02:35.920> forward

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
the old way definitely looking forward

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.909 
the old way definitely looking forward
to<00:02:36.370> hitting<00:02:36.489> the<00:02:36.670> track
