for the clone troopers and like a gun
rack<00:02:50.640> that<00:02:50.879> be<00:02:51.150> better<00:02:51.360> and<00:02:51.769> then<00:02:52.769> like<00:02:52.950> they

00:02:53.119 --> 00:02:53.129 
rack that be better and then like they

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:56.479 
rack that be better and then like they

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:56.489 
put a little ramp from the back and that

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:58.789 
put a little ramp from the back and that
it<00:02:56.790> might<00:02:57.239> get<00:02:57.510> it<00:02:57.629> a<00:02:57.810> little<00:02:57.930> more<00:02:58.200> price<00:02:58.530> here

00:02:58.789 --> 00:02:58.799 
it might get it a little more price here

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:01.009 
it might get it a little more price here
but<00:02:59.040> it<00:02:59.250> would<00:02:59.430> be<00:02:59.459> more<00:03:00.239> you<00:03:00.599> know<00:03:00.629> a<00:03:00.780> little

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:01.019

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:16.460 
I like the least it would have been
thinking<00:03:14.250> IRA<00:03:14.459> price<00:03:14.730> but<00:03:15.260> would<00:03:16.260> have<00:03:16.350> been

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
thinking IRA price but would have been

thinking IRA price but would have been
better<00:03:16.680> I've<00:03:17.310> been<00:03:17.459> a<00:03:17.519> nicer<00:03:17.910> come<00:03:18.540> on<00:03:18.690> I'd<00:03:18.870> not

00:04:22.219 --> 00:04:22.229 
little more what I was going to I might

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:24.230 
little more what I was going to I might
do<00:04:22.500> is<00:04:22.710> I'm<00:04:23.160> going<00:04:23.250> to<00:04:23.370> make<00:04:23.520> like<00:04:23.760> you<00:04:24.090> know

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.240 
do is I'm going to make like you know

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:27.170 
do is I'm going to make like you know
enough<00:04:25.050> space<00:04:25.350> these<00:04:25.830> eight<00:04:26.100> I<00:04:26.370> might<00:04:27.000> like

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180 
enough space these eight I might like

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:30.290 
enough space these eight I might like
make<00:04:27.449> a<00:04:27.919> little<00:04:28.919> ramp<00:04:29.190> that<00:04:29.400> comes<00:04:29.699> down<00:04:29.970> when

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:30.300 
make a little ramp that comes down when

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:33.469 
make a little ramp that comes down when
it<00:04:30.419> lands<00:04:30.900> like<00:04:31.740> this<00:04:32.340> probably<00:04:32.669> goes<00:04:32.820> down<00:04:33.240> on

00:04:33.469 --> 00:04:33.479 
it lands like this probably goes down on

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:34.939 
it lands like this probably goes down on
the<00:04:33.600> winds<00:04:33.990> and<00:04:34.139> you<00:04:34.380> know<00:04:34.500> they<00:04:34.620> could<00:04:34.770> just

00:04:34.939 --> 00:04:34.949 
the winds and you know they could just

00:04:34.949 --> 00:04:36.920 
the winds and you know they could just
come<00:04:35.130> out<00:04:35.280> I<00:04:35.520> don't<00:04:36.030> know<00:04:36.090> I'm<00:04:36.210> still<00:04:36.539> kind<00:04:36.870> of

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:36.930 
come out I don't know I'm still kind of

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:39.770 
come out I don't know I'm still kind of
thinking<00:04:37.830> because<00:04:38.160> it's<00:04:38.400> kind<00:04:38.699> of<00:04:38.780> because

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:39.780 
thinking because it's kind of because

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:42.159 
thinking because it's kind of because
you<00:04:39.900> don't<00:04:40.080> really<00:04:40.139> need<00:04:40.440> these<00:04:41.039> over<00:04:41.520> here

00:04:42.159 --> 00:04:42.169 
you don't really need these over here

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:45.170 
you don't really need these over here
but<00:04:43.169> I'm<00:04:43.410> like<00:04:43.590> I'm<00:04:43.979> going<00:04:44.160> to<00:04:44.250> if<00:04:44.610> I<00:04:44.789> do<00:04:44.849> only

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:45.180 
but I'm like I'm going to if I do only

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:47.060 
but I'm like I'm going to if I do only
needs<00:04:45.389> to<00:04:45.479> be<00:04:45.599> updated<00:04:45.720> with<00:04:46.050> that<00:04:46.259> this<00:04:46.919> is

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:47.070 
needs to be updated with that this is

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:49.189 
needs to be updated with that this is
basically<00:04:47.400> the<00:04:47.490> mod<00:04:47.759> we<00:04:48.360> have<00:04:48.479> to<00:04:48.630> do<00:04:48.810> stakeout

00:04:49.189 --> 00:04:49.199 
basically the mod we have to do stakeout

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:51.140 
basically the mod we have to do stakeout
everything<00:04:49.710> everything<00:04:50.699> is<00:04:50.849> in<00:04:51.000> like

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:51.150 
everything everything is in like

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:53.900 
everything everything is in like
everything<00:04:51.720> recite<00:04:52.229> except<00:04:52.560> these<00:04:52.710> 2<00:04:53.099> y<00:04:53.310> 1<00:04:53.550> x

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:53.910 
everything recite except these 2 y 1 x

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:56.240 
everything recite except these 2 y 1 x
something<00:04:54.599> breaks<00:04:54.870> like<00:04:55.199> 1<00:04:55.380> by<00:04:55.560> 8<00:04:55.770> breaks<00:04:56.070> I

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:56.250 
something breaks like 1 by 8 breaks I

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:59.270 
something breaks like 1 by 8 breaks I
think<00:04:57.229> just<00:04:58.229> leave<00:04:58.440> those<00:04:58.650> and<00:04:58.979> then<00:04:59.039> just

00:04:59.270 --> 00:04:59.280 
think just leave those and then just

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:01.040 
think just leave those and then just
build<00:04:59.550> off<00:04:59.729> of<00:04:59.760> that<00:04:59.970> and<00:05:00.389> make<00:05:00.630> sure<00:05:00.660> you<00:05:00.870> put

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:01.050 
build off of that and make sure you put

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:07.219 
build off of that and make sure you put
the<00:05:01.080> whole<00:05:01.410> for<00:05:02.370> this<00:05:02.550> to<00:05:02.729> come<00:05:02.760> out<00:05:06.020> all<00:05:07.020> the

00:05:07.219 --> 00:05:07.229 
the whole for this to come out all the

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:12.469 
the whole for this to come out all the
clothes<00:05:07.740> that<00:05:07.970> and<00:05:09.530> I'm<00:05:10.530> a<00:05:10.650> little<00:05:11.099> higher<00:05:11.479> so

00:05:12.469 --> 00:05:12.479 
clothes that and I'm a little higher so

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:14.420 
clothes that and I'm a little higher so
you<00:05:12.510> can<00:05:12.720> actually<00:05:12.810> fit<00:05:13.229> the<00:05:13.409> clones<00:05:13.710> heads<00:05:14.070> I

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:14.430 
you can actually fit the clones heads I

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:17.560 
you can actually fit the clones heads I
think<00:05:15.150> that<00:05:15.330> has<00:05:16.050> nothing<00:05:16.199> to<00:05:16.409> do<00:05:16.650> with<00:05:16.800> it

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:17.570 
think that has nothing to do with it

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:21.260 
think that has nothing to do with it
that's<00:05:18.570> okay<00:05:18.960> ma'am<00:05:19.139> I'm<00:05:19.380> oh<00:05:19.919> yeah<00:05:20.310> one<00:05:21.030> thing
