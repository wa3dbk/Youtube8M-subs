00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:08.860
 hello everyone was offered us 

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:11.320
 We found with news about 

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:13.090
 the future 1.9 is the future version of 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:14.469
 minecraft of pc that at the moment unifies 

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:16.600
 of departure but we have enough 

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:18.070
 information little by little and good 

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:20.020
 I come from the outside bringing less than 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:23.110
 seeger workers and up to euro point 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:25.690
 821 mid keel point is to develop 

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:27.250
 of this 1.9 and he has put two tweets 

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:29.080
 this morning on your twitter the first 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:31.379
 we have taking on screen and what 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:33.940
 puts is that it was 1.9 going to have changes 

00:00:31.379 --> 00:00:36.670
 within the game that is to say changes you do not go 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:37.960
 to implementations in 1.1 now not 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:40.600
 implementations at the moment you do not know 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:42.460
 nothing because they have said quite little and 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.260
 It has also focused on not having 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:45.940
 changes as it were so to say in the 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:48.219
 code big changes in the code in 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:51.010
 the end that they are already focusing on 

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:52.659
 that the compatibility of 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:54.399
 mods is to say that establish a 

00:00:52.659 --> 00:00:55.719
 platform a service or something for the 

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:57.729
 style moment has dropped them well 

00:00:55.719 --> 00:01:00.729
 exactly how they want to do it I think 

00:00:57.729 --> 00:01:02.469
 that finally the modes can get 

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:04.360
 easily within minecraft it seems already 

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:05.680
 that is already the date have been talking about the 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.600
 compatibility like a lot ago 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.040
 of time you could say years 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.330
 perfectly 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.340
 what you want to do is that for example 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:15.040
 version 1.8 you can update to the 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:17.470
 2.1 of the mods with ease really 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.850
 seems right I think this goes 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:21.070
 good for the community a lot much 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:22.960
 time in many secrets have said 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:24.040
 that when will you put the compatibility 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.300
 with bots 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:27.070
 It seems that they are making a 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:29.620
 reality seeger are focusing on 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:31.240
 it and it seems right to me because 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:33.040
 Years have passed as I say and a lot 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.900
 people are now crying out and that 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:37.600
 by fidelity to 2.9 you can achieve that 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:40.000
 compatibility with bots was already played 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.950
 I think good news is really 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.900
 this and I think that as I already have 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:45.520
 saying in this video I was already playing 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:47.590
 many people have complained and always 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:50.200
 had said now with mod battery in 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:52.240
 the next version and it never happened and I 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.979
 I think it's about time because 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:56.080
 the modders are already complaining plas 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:58.420
 Look, you told me, and a lot of people 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:00.250
 that are going to put the weakness of mod and 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.229
 then they never put it and it seems that this 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:04.780
 future 1.1 must have changes in mode 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:06.460
 survival but also great 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:08.500
 change in terms of the modders for 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:09.910
 facilitate the work to them really 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.440
 As I say, I am very happy about this 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:12.830
 news tell me what do you think I suppose 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.690
 that will also make us happy 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:16.190
 platform to update is pretty 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.080
 easier to implement within the game 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:21.650
 I think it was already playing as I say it was 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:23.510
 already the important point and to implement it 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.860
 I think it's good to comment and harass me 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.420
 similar as I say is how well this one 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.100
 does not tell us pretty short but it's the 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:31.190
 only training that we have had today 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:33.140
 April 27 , 10 to future 1.9 and as already 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:34.580
 I say as always do go doing 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:35.960
 says you will be making videos here 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:37.430
 below the session also have a 

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:39.470
 link with such news that we can 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:41.000

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:43.220
