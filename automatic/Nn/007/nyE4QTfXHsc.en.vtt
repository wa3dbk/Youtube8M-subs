 It's a great thank god this beach 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.900
 wonderful that I say that is here is the 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.960
 my beach is your beach too the rudder 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:33.329
 the beach beach and lots of happy people average 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.950
 Maybe it's not everyone's beach . 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:38.190
 could be here but we will 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:40.739
 work for it now exactly luiz 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.960
 What is your job, why do you think so? 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.510
 each one in here has his 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:49.890
 participation in life to health 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:52.710
 the motivation to make people 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.840
 the population knows the importance of 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.579
 physical activity the importance of you 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:00.000
 is in a gym right? 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:02.430
 What is your role in this place? 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.040
 my role is exactly the same as 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:08.040
 diverges a little, maybe it's the focus 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.619
 The idea is to help the manager the professional 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.900
 to get it back and these customers 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:16.799
 who is not in the gym today that you 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:18.900
 so much and seeks to bring so much is for the 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:22.229
 sport for physical activity by the 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.970
 well-being is to help this 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.320
 tools that it can really 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.990
 conquer these players today 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:31.570
 very few people in the gym and 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:34.120
 consider the cost so low benefit 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:35.170
 is high that has maybe we could 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:37.150
 do more 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:40.840
 I am convinced that it is a matter of 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:42.850
 marketing and strategy management and 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.530
 we have been very successful because of this because 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:47.110
 people really want and the 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:49.360
 managers can benefit greatly from the 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:51.190
 with this and especially that which 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.500
 matters most to you is that my client 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:56.280
 user customer academia 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:59.050
 I certainly see the following at times. 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.330
 the entrepreneur who wants to open a large 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:04.330
 business that opened a gym is not 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:06.940
 entrepreneur and he sins for this and 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:09.550
 hiring a team 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:12.640
 can he lose because he has so 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:13.330
 strategies for you to hold the student 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.900
 Academy 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:18.850
 Surely there is the big balcony today. 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:21.010
 you understand that the gym product a 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:23.650
 product that is most valued every time 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:26.500
 more but mainly the manager needs to 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:29.230
 be aware of opportunities for 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:31.900
 example is today we are still selling 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:33.640
 Very simple things like tuition 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:36.010
 plans and we are not selling the 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:37.420
 solution that the customer can search for 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:40.209
 example there are people who want to stay 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:42.880
 you want to lose weight that you have 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:45.430
 a fuller life happier 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:48.220
 the gym can do that just yet 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:50.500
 is not selling this I think this 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:52.930
 is that we can help the manager do 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.590
 where we do it both works 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:57.040
 very well 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:03:01.379
 Luis will help you and your company will 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:04.379
 grow up after that they brigade 

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:04.379
 ae 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:06.820
