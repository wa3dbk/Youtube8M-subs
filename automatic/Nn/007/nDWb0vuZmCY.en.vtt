00:03:44.619 --> 00:03:44.629 
to stay away from this here okay this is

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:46.809 
to stay away from this here okay this is
why<00:03:44.780> I<00:03:44.810> said<00:03:45.109> people<00:03:45.290> that<00:03:45.620> we<00:03:45.769> need<00:03:45.919> to<00:03:46.069> start

00:03:46.809 --> 00:03:46.819 
why I said people that we need to start

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:48.970 
why I said people that we need to start
taking<00:03:47.000> care<00:03:47.150> of<00:03:47.329> ourselves<00:03:47.599> by<00:03:48.230> taking

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:48.980 
taking care of ourselves by taking

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:51.970 
taking care of ourselves by taking
vitamins<00:03:49.699> and<00:03:50.000> minerals<00:03:50.419> okay<00:03:50.780> and<00:03:51.019> that's

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:51.980 
vitamins and minerals okay and that's

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:54.399 
vitamins and minerals okay and that's
probably<00:03:52.299> one<00:03:53.299> of<00:03:53.329> the<00:03:53.510> main<00:03:53.690> reasons<00:03:54.139> why<00:03:54.230> we

00:03:54.399 --> 00:03:54.409 
probably one of the main reasons why we

00:03:54.409 --> 00:03:55.720 
probably one of the main reasons why we
have<00:03:54.590> all<00:03:54.709> these<00:03:54.889> different<00:03:55.069> types<00:03:55.310> of

have all these different types of
diseases<00:03:56.709> okay<00:03:57.709> so<00:03:58.069> that's<00:03:58.310> one<00:03:58.750> this<00:03:59.750> is<00:03:59.930> you

00:04:00.219 --> 00:04:00.229 
diseases okay so that's one this is you
