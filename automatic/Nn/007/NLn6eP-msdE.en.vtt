 the whole city since the morning alone 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.570
 unpleasant surprise after other people 

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:22.800
 come to ATMs and there either empty 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.140

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.380

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:32.340
 only â‚¬ 260 can be removed from one card 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:34.260

 hard for electricity water and connection i 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.219

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:43.230
 some food in many private shops 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.510
 you can no longer pay a bank card 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:49.129
 supermarkets and tank fuel stations are happy 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:52.019
 any money but it looks like not for long 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:53.760
 I prefer to take cash 

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:55.409
 credit cards but we only have to take 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.100
 cash from us to this will force 

00:00:55.409 --> 00:00:58.579
 suppliers 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.289

 plan b 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.049
 This is what the government of Cyprus offers 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.899
 create an investment fund of solidarity in it 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:14.130

 state assets part of property 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.750

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.850

 sought a few years ago 

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:45.359
 Cyprus turns into tax from 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.969
 so increasingly to the parliament building 

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:48.750
 come not only the Cypriot opposition and 

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:51.420

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:26.569
 postal service unlike banks 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:28.640
