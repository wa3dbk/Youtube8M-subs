setup<00:00:08.639> because<00:00:08.849> I<00:00:08.880> still<00:00:09.210> get<00:00:09.389> a<00:00:09.420> lot<00:00:09.690> of

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
setup because I still get a lot of

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:12.320 
setup because I still get a lot of
questions<00:00:10.200> about<00:00:10.349> this<00:00:10.650> I<00:00:10.889> have<00:00:11.820> covered<00:00:12.090> this

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
questions about this I have covered this

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.150 
questions about this I have covered this
in<00:00:12.540> other<00:00:12.660> videos<00:00:12.780> but<00:00:13.320> I've<00:00:13.440> not<00:00:13.889> done<00:00:14.099> a

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
in other videos but I've not done a

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.220 
in other videos but I've not done a
video<00:00:14.400> where<00:00:14.730> we're<00:00:15.540> just<00:00:15.570> talking<00:00:16.170> about

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
video where we're just talking about

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.010 
video where we're just talking about
that<00:00:16.590> so<00:00:16.949> I<00:00:17.180> sort<00:00:18.180> of<00:00:18.270> like<00:00:18.510> these<00:00:18.750> short

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
that so I sort of like these short

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.870 
that so I sort of like these short
videos<00:00:19.199> because<00:00:19.710> I<00:00:19.800> can<00:00:19.980> point<00:00:20.279> people<00:00:20.490> to

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
videos because I can point people to

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.120 
videos because I can point people to
them<00:00:21.170> to<00:00:22.170> get<00:00:22.470> their<00:00:22.619> questions<00:00:22.740> answered

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
them to get their questions answered

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.029 
them to get their questions answered
instead<00:00:23.730> of<00:00:23.900> typing<00:00:24.900> the<00:00:25.109> same<00:00:25.350> answers<00:00:25.680> over

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
instead of typing the same answers over

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.570 
instead of typing the same answers over
and<00:00:26.220> over<00:00:26.460> and<00:00:26.580> over<00:00:26.699> so<00:00:26.939> so<00:00:27.840> here<00:00:28.289> this<00:00:29.279> is<00:00:29.550> a

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
and over and over so so here this is a

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.400 
and over and over so so here this is a
new<00:00:30.060> project<00:00:30.300> I<00:00:30.750> don't<00:00:30.929> know<00:00:30.990> if<00:00:31.080> I<00:00:31.170> can<00:00:31.289> talk

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
new project I don't know if I can talk

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.010 
new project I don't know if I can talk
about<00:00:31.619> what<00:00:31.769> it<00:00:31.859> is<00:00:32.360> but<00:00:33.360> you<00:00:33.510> can<00:00:33.630> see<00:00:33.809> I've

about what it is but you can see I've

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.580 
about what it is but you can see I've
just<00:00:34.050> imported<00:00:34.829> the<00:00:35.309> it's<00:00:35.910> a<00:00:36.090> tiff<00:00:36.540> file<00:00:36.840> with

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
just imported the it's a tiff file with

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.250 
just imported the it's a tiff file with
the<00:00:37.710> inks<00:00:38.160> on<00:00:38.309> there<00:00:38.629> you<00:00:39.629> can<00:00:39.780> see<00:00:39.930> I'm<00:00:40.050> just

the inks on there you can see I'm just

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.610 
the inks on there you can see I'm just
showing<00:00:40.860> the<00:00:41.450> Photoshop<00:00:42.450> background<00:00:43.440> layer

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
showing the Photoshop background layer

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.000 
showing the Photoshop background layer
and<00:00:43.800> that's<00:00:44.430> it<00:00:44.730> and<00:00:45.379> people<00:00:46.379> like<00:00:46.530> to<00:00:46.680> talk

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
and that's it and people like to talk

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.229 
and that's it and people like to talk
about<00:00:47.219> channels<00:00:47.820> and<00:00:48.680> all<00:00:49.680> sorts<00:00:50.190> of<00:00:50.280> complex

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
about channels and all sorts of complex

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.770 
about channels and all sorts of complex
ways<00:00:51.510> of<00:00:51.840> creating<00:00:52.320> alpha<00:00:53.010> there's<00:00:53.940> there's<00:00:54.719> a

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
ways of creating alpha there's there's a

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.479 
ways of creating alpha there's there's a
really<00:00:55.110> easy<00:00:55.320> way<00:00:55.620> to<00:00:55.649> set<00:00:56.070> up<00:00:56.160> your<00:00:56.280> layers

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
really easy way to set up your layers

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.729 
really easy way to set up your layers
and<00:00:56.820> that's<00:00:57.120> what<00:00:57.390> we're<00:00:57.840> going<00:00:58.289> to<00:00:58.320> do<00:00:58.500> today

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
and that's what we're going to do today

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.740 
and that's what we're going to do today
so<00:00:58.770> first<00:00:59.760> I'm<00:00:59.969> going<00:01:00.090> to<00:01:00.149> double<00:01:00.449> click<00:01:00.539> the

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
so first I'm going to double click the

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.740 
so first I'm going to double click the
background<00:01:01.199> and<00:01:01.940> I'm<00:01:02.940> going<00:01:03.120> to<00:01:03.180> call<00:01:03.329> it<00:01:03.480> inks

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
background and I'm going to call it inks

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.780 
background and I'm going to call it inks
so<00:01:04.110> what<00:01:04.199> I<00:01:04.260> like<00:01:04.409> to<00:01:04.500> call<00:01:04.559> it<00:01:04.710> I'm<00:01:05.580> going<00:01:05.729> to

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
so what I like to call it I'm going to

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.250 
so what I like to call it I'm going to
set<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.090> mode<00:01:06.299> to<00:01:06.500> multiply<00:01:07.500> and<00:01:09.049> that's<00:01:10.049> it

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
set the mode to multiply and that's it

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.010 
set the mode to multiply and that's it
so<00:01:10.560> we<00:01:10.680> have<00:01:10.799> H<00:01:11.040> layer<00:01:11.280> multiply<00:01:12.090> that's<00:01:12.750> step

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
so we have H layer multiply that's step

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.859 
so we have H layer multiply that's step
one<00:01:13.460> number<00:01:14.460> two<00:01:14.760> I'm<00:01:15.299> going<00:01:15.420> to<00:01:15.509> make<00:01:15.630> a<00:01:15.659> new

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
one number two I'm going to make a new

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:16.390 
one number two I'm going to make a new
layer

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:16.400 
layer

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.010 
layer
put<00:01:17.400> it<00:01:17.490> beneath<00:01:17.759> the<00:01:17.909> inks<00:01:18.240> I'm<00:01:18.479> going<00:01:18.960> to

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
put it beneath the inks I'm going to

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.660 
put it beneath the inks I'm going to
call<00:01:19.200> it<00:01:19.409> flats<00:01:20.810> and<00:01:21.920> this<00:01:22.920> is<00:01:23.070> where<00:01:23.280> I<00:01:23.310> would

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
call it flats and this is where I would

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.010 
call it flats and this is where I would
go<00:01:23.939> in<00:01:24.180> and<00:01:24.530> flat<00:01:25.530> my<00:01:25.799> colors<00:01:26.700> as<00:01:27.450> you<00:01:27.509> see<00:01:27.869> me

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
go in and flat my colors as you see me

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.469 
go in and flat my colors as you see me
do<00:01:28.170> in<00:01:28.380> in<00:01:28.619> many<00:01:28.920> other<00:01:29.159> videos<00:01:29.490> I<00:01:29.700> like<00:01:30.299> to

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
do in in many other videos I like to

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.660 
do in in many other videos I like to
fill<00:01:30.659> it<00:01:30.810> with<00:01:30.930> the<00:01:30.990> with<00:01:31.710> a<00:01:31.740> base<00:01:32.009> color<00:01:32.310> first

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
fill it with the with a base color first

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.149 
fill it with the with a base color first
just<00:01:33.570> a<00:01:33.689> little<00:01:33.780> bit<00:01:33.990> easier<00:01:34.110> on<00:01:34.500> the<00:01:34.590> eyes<00:01:34.799> to

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
just a little bit easier on the eyes to

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.310 
just a little bit easier on the eyes to
me<00:01:35.310> but<00:01:35.520> I<00:01:35.729> won't<00:01:36.360> be<00:01:36.450> doing<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:36.840> flats<00:01:37.110> on

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
me but I won't be doing the flats on

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.260

example here but so once I've got

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.469 
example here but so once I've got
everything<00:01:42.960> flatted<00:01:43.860> let's<00:01:44.220> say<00:01:44.460> just<00:01:45.360> so

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
we're going to flat this house okay BAM

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.620 
we're going to flat this house okay BAM
alright<00:01:52.049> so<00:01:52.259> flats<00:01:53.100> layer<00:01:53.369> the<00:01:54.149> next<00:01:54.420> thing

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
I'm going to do is duplicate this layer

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:02.060 
I'm going to do is duplicate this layer
and<00:01:58.640> call<00:01:59.640> it<00:01:59.700> colors<00:02:00.119> I<00:02:00.329> don't<00:02:01.170> want<00:02:01.500> to<00:02:01.740> color

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
and call it colors I don't want to color

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.270 
and call it colors I don't want to color
on<00:02:02.430> my<00:02:02.939> flats<00:02:03.240> layer<00:02:03.479> because<00:02:04.079> I<00:02:04.380> want<00:02:05.100> to<00:02:05.159> keep

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
on my flats layer because I want to keep

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.690 
on my flats layer because I want to keep
those<00:02:06.619> the<00:02:07.619> way<00:02:07.740> they<00:02:07.890> are<00:02:08.039> so<00:02:08.369> that<00:02:08.489> I<00:02:08.520> can

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
those the way they are so that I can

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.750 
those the way they are so that I can
always<00:02:08.819> go<00:02:09.149> back<00:02:09.179> no<00:02:09.810> matter<00:02:09.929> what<00:02:10.200> I<00:02:10.229> do<00:02:10.610> if<00:02:11.610> I

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
always go back no matter what I do if I

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.550 
always go back no matter what I do if I
go<00:02:12.000> in<00:02:12.120> here<00:02:12.150> and<00:02:12.510> do<00:02:12.629> a<00:02:12.660> bunch<00:02:12.900> of<00:02:12.959> coloring<00:02:13.379> on

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
go in here and do a bunch of coloring on

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:14.059 
go in here and do a bunch of coloring on
this

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
this

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:16.250 
this
I<00:02:14.100> can<00:02:14.520> always<00:02:14.880> go<00:02:15.060> back<00:02:15.090> to<00:02:15.450> the<00:02:15.569> flats<00:02:15.930> layer

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
I can always go back to the flats layer

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.330 
I can always go back to the flats layer
here<00:02:16.620> and<00:02:17.120> grab<00:02:18.120> that<00:02:18.300> entire<00:02:18.720> area<00:02:19.440> if<00:02:19.950> I<00:02:20.130> want

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
here and grab that entire area if I want

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.440 
here and grab that entire area if I want
to<00:02:20.459> make<00:02:20.640> corrections<00:02:21.180> to<00:02:21.360> that<00:02:21.510> so<00:02:23.090> so<00:02:24.090> again

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
to make corrections to that so so again

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.059 
to make corrections to that so so again
one<00:02:24.780> more<00:02:24.900> time<00:02:25.170> just<00:02:25.200> to<00:02:25.440> show<00:02:25.530> you<00:02:25.709> how<00:02:25.890> easy

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069 
one more time just to show you how easy

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:28.940 
one more time just to show you how easy
this<00:02:26.280> is<00:02:26.420> we<00:02:27.420> have<00:02:27.540> the<00:02:27.600> background<00:02:27.780> layer<00:02:28.170> I'm

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
this is we have the background layer I'm

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:33.070 
this is we have the background layer I'm
going<00:02:29.790> to<00:02:30.090> change<00:02:30.990> that<00:02:31.260> to<00:02:31.560> an<00:02:31.830> inks<00:02:32.250> layer

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080 
going to change that to an inks layer

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.270 
going to change that to an inks layer
rename<00:02:34.080> it<00:02:34.380> to<00:02:34.410> an<00:02:34.620> ink<00:02:34.740> layer<00:02:34.980> that's<00:02:35.100> what<00:02:35.250> I

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
rename it to an ink layer that's what I

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.650 
rename it to an ink layer that's what I
call<00:02:35.520> it<00:02:35.670> and<00:02:35.700> set<00:02:36.120> it<00:02:36.209> to<00:02:36.300> multiply<00:02:36.650> and<00:02:38.660> then

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
call it and set it to multiply and then

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:43.010 
call it and set it to multiply and then
I'm<00:02:40.140> going<00:02:40.260> to<00:02:40.320> make<00:02:40.470> a<00:02:40.500> new<00:02:40.709> layer<00:02:40.890> and<00:02:41.930> put<00:02:42.930> it

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020 
I'm going to make a new layer and put it

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:46.490 
I'm going to make a new layer and put it
below<00:02:43.170> the<00:02:43.920> inks<00:02:44.160> layer<00:02:44.340> and<00:02:45.110> call<00:02:46.110> it<00:02:46.170> flats

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
below the inks layer and call it flats

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:53.060 
below the inks layer and call it flats
and<00:02:47.870> then<00:02:48.870> I<00:02:48.989> will<00:02:49.110> do<00:02:49.230> my<00:02:49.380> flatting<00:02:50.270> and<00:02:52.070> then

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.070 
and then I will do my flatting and then

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:55.670 
and then I will do my flatting and then
duplicate<00:02:53.610> this<00:02:53.760> layer<00:02:53.820> and<00:02:54.470> call<00:02:55.470> that

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
duplicate this layer and call that

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.000 
duplicate this layer and call that
colors<00:02:56.040> and<00:02:57.410> then<00:02:58.410> I'm<00:02:58.500> going<00:02:58.620> to<00:02:58.650> color<00:02:58.860> on

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
colors and then I'm going to color on

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:03.490 
colors and then I'm going to color on
that<00:02:59.130> layer<00:02:59.280> so<00:03:00.650> that<00:03:01.650> is<00:03:01.970> really<00:03:02.970> all<00:03:03.239> I<00:03:03.269> do

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.500 
that layer so that is really all I do

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:06.440 
that layer so that is really all I do
the<00:03:04.500> the<00:03:04.890> next<00:03:05.130> step<00:03:05.250> which<00:03:06.090> you've<00:03:06.300> already

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
the the next step which you've already

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:10.790 
the the next step which you've already
seen<00:03:06.930> in<00:03:07.260> the<00:03:07.890> other<00:03:08.430> video<00:03:08.810> for<00:03:09.810> a<00:03:10.320> camera

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:10.800 
seen in the other video for a camera

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.860 
seen in the other video for a camera
what<00:03:10.950> the<00:03:11.040> name<00:03:11.160> of<00:03:11.280> it<00:03:11.370> was<00:03:11.550> the<00:03:12.209> selection

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
what the name of it was the selection

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:16.100 
what the name of it was the selection
trick<00:03:13.170> as<00:03:13.350> I<00:03:13.530> call<00:03:13.739> it<00:03:14.239> where<00:03:15.239> I<00:03:15.269> go<00:03:15.540> in<00:03:15.720> and

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 
trick as I call it where I go in and

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:17.240 
trick as I call it where I go in and
render<00:03:16.350> on<00:03:16.440> top<00:03:16.680> of<00:03:16.830> that<00:03:16.890> you'll<00:03:17.070> have<00:03:17.130> to

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
render on top of that you'll have to

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:19.490 
render on top of that you'll have to
watch<00:03:17.400> that<00:03:17.610> video<00:03:17.910> to<00:03:18.510> see<00:03:18.720> how<00:03:19.049> that<00:03:19.110> works

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
watch that video to see how that works

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.880 
watch that video to see how that works
that's<00:03:19.920> the<00:03:20.190> the<00:03:20.700> selection<00:03:21.180> trick<00:03:21.450> video

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:21.890 
that's the the selection trick video

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:25.280 
that's the the selection trick video
which<00:03:22.890> is<00:03:23.070> just<00:03:23.510> three<00:03:24.510> or<00:03:24.600> four<00:03:24.630> videos<00:03:25.049> ago

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
which is just three or four videos ago

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:28.009 
which is just three or four videos ago
but<00:03:25.950> anyway<00:03:26.250> that's<00:03:26.700> my<00:03:26.970> layer<00:03:27.209> setup<00:03:27.630> it's

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:28.019 
but anyway that's my layer setup it's

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:31.670 
but anyway that's my layer setup it's
very<00:03:28.320> simple<00:03:30.049> but<00:03:31.049> yeah<00:03:31.170> that's<00:03:31.350> pretty<00:03:31.470> much

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
very simple but yeah that's pretty much

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.680 
very simple but yeah that's pretty much
it<00:03:31.799> that's<00:03:32.160> enough<00:03:32.519> to<00:03:32.670> get<00:03:32.820> started<00:03:33.030> coloring

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
it that's enough to get started coloring

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:36.259 
it that's enough to get started coloring
so<00:03:34.140> I<00:03:34.380> know<00:03:34.829> I've<00:03:35.010> covered<00:03:35.850> this<00:03:36.000> in<00:03:36.150> other
