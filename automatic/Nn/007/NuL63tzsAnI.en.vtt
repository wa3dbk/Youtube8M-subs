here itself so we pick up the internal
hard<00:01:02.250> drive<00:01:02.489> we<00:01:02.670> can<00:01:02.699> see<00:01:03.000> here<00:01:03.329> with

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
hard drive we can see here with

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.299 
hard drive we can see here with
connections<00:01:04.290> of<00:01:04.409> this<00:01:04.559> thing<00:01:04.769> for<00:01:04.979> connecting

both power and data into and
corresponding<00:01:08.729> cables<00:01:09.150> in<00:01:09.270> here<00:01:09.299> but<00:01:10.140> we

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
corresponding cables in here but we

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:11.630 
corresponding cables in here but we
basically<00:01:10.560> want<00:01:10.830> to<00:01:10.920> do<00:01:11.070> is<00:01:11.250> we're<00:01:11.430> going<00:01:11.460> to

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
basically want to do is we're going to

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.090 
basically want to do is we're going to
mount<00:01:11.880> it<00:01:12.200> here<00:01:14.090> into<00:01:15.090> the<00:01:15.240> smokes<00:01:15.570> here

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:16.100 
mount it here into the smokes here

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.560 
mount it here into the smokes here
difficulty<00:01:17.100> and<00:01:17.280> we<00:01:17.400> for<00:01:17.700> with<00:01:18.180> serious

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
difficulty and we for with serious

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.020 
difficulty and we for with serious
screws<00:01:18.930> then<00:01:19.229> you<00:01:19.530> can<00:01:20.040> see<00:01:20.189> of<00:01:20.310> them<00:01:20.549> two

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
screws then you can see of them two

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.170 
screws then you can see of them two
holes<00:01:21.240> here<00:01:22.080> here<00:01:22.830> here<00:01:23.580> and<00:01:23.610> here<00:01:23.820> at<00:01:24.060> the

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
holes here here here and here at the

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.850 
holes here here here and here at the
different<00:01:24.450> corners<00:01:24.780> which<00:01:25.200> are<00:01:25.320> capable<00:01:25.500> of

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
different corners which are capable of

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.679 
different corners which are capable of
holding<00:01:26.009> the<00:01:26.310> actual<00:01:26.640> DVR<00:01:27.060> or<00:01:27.090> they<00:01:27.630> don't

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
holding the actual DVR or they don't

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.929 
holding the actual DVR or they don't
they<00:01:28.020> actually<00:01:28.560> and<00:01:28.770> internal<00:01:29.549> hard<00:01:29.759> drive

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
they actually and internal hard drive

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.880 
they actually and internal hard drive
itself<00:01:30.240> the<00:01:30.720> difficult<00:01:31.200> we<00:01:31.350> have<00:01:31.380> here<00:01:31.770> is

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
itself the difficult we have here is

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.069 
itself the difficult we have here is
that<00:01:32.040> it's<00:01:32.159> easy<00:01:32.549> screwing<00:01:33.420> the<00:01:33.540> two<00:01:33.689> holes<00:01:33.930> in

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
that it's easy screwing the two holes in

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:35.929 
that it's easy screwing the two holes in
this<00:01:34.259> side<00:01:34.500> screws<00:01:35.070> in<00:01:35.250> this<00:01:35.369> side<00:01:35.549> but

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
this side screws in this side but

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.850 
this side screws in this side but
impossible<00:01:36.270> from<00:01:36.720> the<00:01:36.780> front<00:01:37.049> simply<00:01:37.619> because

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
impossible from the front simply because

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.950 
impossible from the front simply because
we<00:01:38.159> just<00:01:38.340> have<00:01:38.520> no<00:01:38.640> access<00:01:39.060> into<00:01:39.299> it<00:01:39.420> so

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
we just have no access into it so

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.080 
we just have no access into it so
because<00:01:40.680> we<00:01:40.829> want<00:01:40.950> to<00:01:41.070> be<00:01:41.250> secured<00:01:41.700> with<00:01:41.880> four

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
because we want to be secured with four

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.880 
because we want to be secured with four
screws<00:01:42.299> we've<00:01:42.930> made<00:01:43.110> a<00:01:43.140> decision<00:01:43.259> to<00:01:43.649> do<00:01:43.770> is

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
screws we've made a decision to do is

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:44.899 
screws we've made a decision to do is
we're<00:01:44.009> actually<00:01:44.130> just<00:01:44.280> going<00:01:44.520> to

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
we're actually just going to

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.380 
we're actually just going to
this<00:01:45.320> housing<00:01:46.320> here<00:01:46.579> from<00:01:47.579> the<00:01:47.789> actual<00:01:48.030> ddr

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
this housing here from the actual ddr

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.249 
this housing here from the actual ddr
itself<00:01:48.869> so<00:01:49.649> that's<00:01:49.770> the<00:01:49.859> first<00:01:50.069> one<00:01:50.219> there<00:01:51.259> and

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
itself so that's the first one there and

00:01:52.259 --> 00:02:05.359

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
okay I got to repeat the same process to

00:02:51.480 --> 00:03:00.480 
okay I got to repeat the same process to
this<00:02:51.660> corner<00:02:51.930> here

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:00.490 

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:04.240 

that's<00:03:01.490> her<00:03:01.730> then<00:03:01.970> like<00:03:02.120> this<00:03:02.560> so<00:03:03.560> now<00:03:03.710> we<00:03:04.070> have

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
that's her then like this so now we have

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:06.970 
that's her then like this so now we have
on<00:03:04.400> this<00:03:04.550> side<00:03:04.870> it<00:03:05.870> mounted<00:03:06.320> into<00:03:06.560> the<00:03:06.680> frame

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
on this side it mounted into the frame

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:09.310 
on this side it mounted into the frame
so<00:03:07.910> what<00:03:08.060> I'll<00:03:08.120> do<00:03:08.240> now<00:03:08.450> is<00:03:08.480> I'll<00:03:08.660> just<00:03:08.990> touch

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:09.320 
so what I'll do now is I'll just touch

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.820 
so what I'll do now is I'll just touch
that

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:09.830 
that

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:11.740 
that
isn't<00:03:10.370> yet<00:03:10.490> I'm<00:03:10.970> just<00:03:11.030> going<00:03:11.330> to<00:03:11.360> slide<00:03:11.600> this

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750 
isn't yet I'm just going to slide this

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:13.990 
isn't yet I'm just going to slide this
video<00:03:12.140> back<00:03:12.950> down<00:03:13.160> with<00:03:13.310> the<00:03:13.400> position<00:03:13.820> here

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.000 
video back down with the position here

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.240 
video back down with the position here
so<00:03:14.240> now<00:03:15.080> what<00:03:15.290> we<00:03:15.380> can<00:03:15.530> do<00:03:15.650> is<00:03:15.830> we<00:03:15.950> can<00:03:16.010> actually

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.250 
so now what we can do is we can actually

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:19.210 
so now what we can do is we can actually
come<00:03:16.400> along<00:03:16.640> we'll<00:03:17.300> slide<00:03:17.540> this<00:03:17.750> in<00:03:17.960> and<00:03:18.220> now

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.220 
come along we'll slide this in and now

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:21.640 
come along we'll slide this in and now
we<00:03:19.580> have<00:03:19.730> a<00:03:19.760> slightly<00:03:20.240> tricky<00:03:20.600> process<00:03:21.020> I've

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
we have a slightly tricky process I've

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:23.980 
we have a slightly tricky process I've
tried<00:03:21.890> to<00:03:22.010> mount<00:03:22.190> this<00:03:22.510> onto<00:03:23.510> the<00:03:23.810> existing

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:23.990 
tried to mount this onto the existing

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:25.780 
tried to mount this onto the existing
holes<00:03:24.530> over<00:03:24.620> here<00:03:24.740> okay

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:25.790 
holes over here okay

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:27.520 
holes over here okay
so<00:03:26.150> we<00:03:26.270> need<00:03:26.420> to<00:03:26.540> do<00:03:26.630> is<00:03:26.810> go<00:03:26.990> and<00:03:27.170> find<00:03:27.410> the

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:27.530 
so we need to do is go and find the

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:31.450 
so we need to do is go and find the
original<00:03:27.590> screws<00:03:28.160> that<00:03:28.340> we<00:03:28.430> have<00:03:28.580> here<00:03:30.460> at

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:31.460 
original screws that we have here at

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:44.110 
original screws that we have here at
this<00:03:31.520> point<00:03:31.820> here<00:03:32.030> I<00:03:34.660> just<00:03:35.660> need<00:03:35.780> it<00:03:43.120> that's

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:44.120 
this point here I just need it that's

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.510 
this point here I just need it that's
one<00:03:44.360> that<00:03:44.450> we<00:03:44.570> firmly<00:03:44.900> fix<00:03:45.260> now<00:03:45.470> I'll<00:03:46.340> pick<00:03:46.490> up

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:46.520 
one that we firmly fix now I'll pick up

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:55.300 
one that we firmly fix now I'll pick up
the<00:03:46.670> next<00:03:46.820> one<00:03:47.030> here<00:03:48.370> feed<00:03:49.370> the<00:03:49.490> process<00:03:54.310> lock

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:55.310

the next one here feed the process lock
that<00:03:55.460> into<00:03:55.640> position<00:03:57.460> and<00:04:00.040> I'll<00:04:01.040> just<00:04:01.220> repeat

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:01.490 
that into position and I'll just repeat

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:06.760 
that into position and I'll just repeat
the<00:04:01.640> process<00:04:01.670> here<00:04:05.380> I'm<00:04:06.380> just<00:04:06.590> going<00:04:06.740> to

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:06.770 
the process here I'm just going to

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:12.340 
the process here I'm just going to
rotate<00:04:06.920> this<00:04:07.430> around<00:04:07.610> I<00:04:08.680> can<00:04:10.030> and<00:04:11.030> then<00:04:11.720> adjust

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:12.350 
rotate this around I can and then adjust

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:14.290 
rotate this around I can and then adjust
a<00:04:12.530> little<00:04:12.830> bit<00:04:13.040> of<00:04:13.280> pulling<00:04:13.730> on<00:04:13.970> the<00:04:14.090> hard

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:14.300 
a little bit of pulling on the hard

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:25.870 
a little bit of pulling on the hard
drives<00:04:14.540> on<00:04:14.780> this<00:04:14.930> required<00:04:15.320> here

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:25.880 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:31.870 

the<00:04:26.600> birthing<00:04:27.590> process<00:04:27.650> here<00:04:29.080> final<00:04:30.370> sure<00:04:31.370> and

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:31.880 
the birthing process here final sure and

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:33.190 
the birthing process here final sure and
you<00:04:31.970> can<00:04:32.090> see<00:04:32.240> anyway<00:04:32.600> we<00:04:32.750> have<00:04:32.870> the<00:04:32.960> internal

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:33.200 
you can see anyway we have the internal

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:35.770 
you can see anyway we have the internal
hard<00:04:33.530> drive<00:04:33.710> extremely<00:04:34.700> securely<00:04:35.330> locked<00:04:35.630> in

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:35.780 
hard drive extremely securely locked in

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:39.370 
hard drive extremely securely locked in
position<00:04:35.900> now<00:04:37.570> the<00:04:38.570> final<00:04:38.990> step<00:04:39.140> the<00:04:39.260> process

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:39.380 
position now the final step the process

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:41.140 
position now the final step the process
and<00:04:39.830> sometimes<00:04:40.070> you<00:04:40.310> can<00:04:40.460> do<00:04:40.550> this<00:04:40.730> before<00:04:40.880> we

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:41.150 
and sometimes you can do this before we

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:42.610 
and sometimes you can do this before we
have<00:04:41.390> to<00:04:41.510> put<00:04:41.660> in<00:04:41.750> the<00:04:41.810> harbor<00:04:42.170> election

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:42.620 
have to put in the harbor election

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:44.770 
have to put in the harbor election
connector<00:04:42.950> cables<00:04:43.340> itself<00:04:43.640> okay<00:04:44.030> so<00:04:44.540> I'm<00:04:44.630> just

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:55.900 
and the data cable so I might just
connect<00:04:53.900> a<00:04:54.110> cable<00:04:54.380> here<00:04:54.560> first<00:04:54.920> so<00:04:55.790> you<00:04:55.880> can
