let's<00:00:56.160> examine<00:00:56.370> now<00:00:57.090> how<00:00:57.360> the<00:00:57.420> battery

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
let's examine now how the battery

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.900 
let's examine now how the battery
operates<00:00:58.469> we're<00:00:59.250> going<00:00:59.399> to<00:00:59.460> look<00:00:59.550> at<00:00:59.760> the

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
operates we're going to look at the

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.720 
operates we're going to look at the
battery<00:01:00.270> first<00:01:00.660> in<00:01:00.870> a<00:01:00.930> charged<00:01:01.320> state<00:01:01.859> so<00:01:02.520> here

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
battery first in a charged state so here

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.530 
battery first in a charged state so here
we<00:01:02.820> can<00:01:03.000> see<00:01:03.270> that<00:01:03.539> we<00:01:03.690> have<00:01:03.899> lithium<00:01:04.409> ions<00:01:04.830> and

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:05.540 
we can see that we have lithium ions and

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:08.149 
we can see that we have lithium ions and
as<00:01:06.540> the<00:01:06.810> battery<00:01:07.170> begins<00:01:07.530> to<00:01:07.680> discharge

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
as the battery begins to discharge

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.390 
as the battery begins to discharge
electrons<00:01:08.729> flow<00:01:09.150> from<00:01:09.420> the<00:01:10.229> anode<00:01:10.650> down<00:01:11.070> to

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
electrons flow from the anode down to

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.670 
electrons flow from the anode down to
the<00:01:11.520> cathode<00:01:11.970> and<00:01:12.299> we<00:01:12.689> get<00:01:12.840> a<00:01:12.869> migration<00:01:13.290> of

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
the cathode and we get a migration of

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.219 
the cathode and we get a migration of
the<00:01:13.979> lithium<00:01:14.220> ions<00:01:14.670> from<00:01:15.000> the<00:01:15.180> anode<00:01:15.540> down<00:01:15.869> to

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
the lithium ions from the anode down to

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:17.090 
the lithium ions from the anode down to
the<00:01:16.439> cathode

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
the cathode

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.800 
the cathode
once<00:01:17.670> the<00:01:17.820> battery<00:01:18.000> reads<00:01:18.390> the<00:01:18.570> cutoff

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
once the battery reads the cutoff

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.140 
once the battery reads the cutoff
voltage<00:01:19.110> we<00:01:20.009> can<00:01:20.159> then<00:01:20.310> charge<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:20.820> battery

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
voltage we can then charge the battery

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.429 
voltage we can then charge the battery
and<00:01:21.240> this<00:01:21.420> is<00:01:21.630> where<00:01:21.869> the<00:01:21.990> process<00:01:22.200> is

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
and this is where the process is

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:23.929 
and this is where the process is
reversed<00:01:22.920> you<00:01:23.100> can<00:01:23.220> see<00:01:23.369> the<00:01:23.460> electrons

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
reversed you can see the electrons

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.539 
reversed you can see the electrons
flowing<00:01:24.210> in<00:01:24.420> the<00:01:24.509> opposite<00:01:24.930> direction

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:25.549 
flowing in the opposite direction

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:28.280 
flowing in the opposite direction
recombining<00:01:26.549> with<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:27.180> lithium<00:01:27.540> ions<00:01:27.900> and

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
recombining with the lithium ions and

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.499 
recombining with the lithium ions and
then<00:01:28.380> the<00:01:28.470> lithium<00:01:28.860> is<00:01:29.100> being<00:01:29.700> deposited<00:01:30.030> up

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
then the lithium is being deposited up

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.679 
then the lithium is being deposited up
at<00:01:30.930> the<00:01:31.110> anode<00:01:31.290> surface<00:01:31.799> this<00:01:32.790> process<00:01:33.390> can

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
at the anode surface this process can

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.690 
at the anode surface this process can
take<00:01:33.930> place<00:01:34.320> many<00:01:34.560> many<00:01:34.829> thousands<00:01:35.369> of<00:01:35.460> times

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
take place many many thousands of times

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.969 
take place many many thousands of times
and<00:01:35.970> it's<00:01:36.119> why<00:01:36.360> a<00:01:36.390> simple<00:01:36.840> enter<00:01:37.200> chip<00:01:37.380> can

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
and it's why a simple enter chip can

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.140 
and it's why a simple enter chip can
last<00:01:38.280> the<00:01:38.520> life<00:01:38.700> of<00:01:38.970> the<00:01:39.030> product

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:41.150 
last the life of the product

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:43.490 
last the life of the product
this<00:01:42.150> can<00:01:42.390> be<00:01:42.509> packaged<00:01:42.930> a<00:01:42.990> number<00:01:43.259> of<00:01:43.320> ways
