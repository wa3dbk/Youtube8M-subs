little bit different we saw a restore

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:38.260 
little bit different we saw a restore
kit<00:02:36.770> and<00:02:36.980> the<00:02:37.220> restore<00:02:37.520> kit<00:02:37.730> is<00:02:37.910> where<00:02:38.120> you

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:38.270 
kit and the restore kit is where you

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:41.680 
kit and the restore kit is where you
take<00:02:38.510> the<00:02:39.440> solution<00:02:40.340> you'll<00:02:41.000> actually<00:02:41.240> spray

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:41.690 
take the solution you'll actually spray

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:43.900 
take the solution you'll actually spray
it<00:02:41.780> on<00:02:41.900> the<00:02:42.140> filter<00:02:42.610> then<00:02:43.610> you'll<00:02:43.760> actually

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:43.910 
it on the filter then you'll actually

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:46.390 
it on the filter then you'll actually
rinse<00:02:44.390> it<00:02:44.540> off<00:02:44.660> with<00:02:45.260> water<00:02:45.500> and<00:02:45.830> then<00:02:46.280> you'll

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
rinse it off with water and then you'll

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.120 
rinse it off with water and then you'll
go<00:02:46.520> into<00:02:46.550> a<00:02:46.760> rial<00:02:47.270> stage<00:02:47.630> and<00:02:47.960> the<00:02:48.410> rial<00:02:48.770> stage

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.130 
go into a rial stage and the rial stage

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:51.310 
go into a rial stage and the rial stage
is<00:02:49.480> basically<00:02:50.480> where<00:02:50.750> you're<00:02:50.870> going<00:02:50.990> to<00:02:51.050> take

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:51.320 
is basically where you're going to take

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:54.070 
is basically where you're going to take
the<00:02:52.100> filter<00:02:52.790> and<00:02:53.000> you're<00:02:53.390> going<00:02:53.540> to<00:02:53.600> take<00:02:53.810> the

the filter and you're going to take the

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.290 
the filter and you're going to take the
oil<00:02:54.500> and<00:02:54.860> you're<00:02:55.070> gonna<00:02:55.190> go<00:02:55.370> roughly<00:02:56.060> two

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:56.300 
oil and you're gonna go roughly two

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:59.290 
oil and you're gonna go roughly two

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:01.360 
strips in the middle of the filter
around<00:02:59.870> and<00:03:00.230> you're<00:03:00.410> going<00:03:00.500> to<00:03:00.560> let<00:03:00.740> it<00:03:00.770> set<00:03:01.100> as

because<00:03:21.200> it<00:03:21.320> will<00:03:24.250> we<00:03:25.250> also<00:03:25.400> offer<00:03:25.730> four

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.090 
because it will we also offer four

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:28.550 
filters for some people who like to have

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:32.020 
filters for some people who like to have
the<00:03:29.450> option<00:03:29.600> is<00:03:30.050> say<00:03:30.980> if<00:03:31.130> I<00:03:31.220> was<00:03:31.370> running<00:03:31.790> a

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.030 
the option is say if I was running a

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:37.090 
the option is say if I was running a
filter<00:03:32.810> of<00:03:33.140> our<00:03:33.800> standard<00:03:34.540> dry<00:03:35.540> I<00:03:35.810> also<00:03:36.770> make<00:03:37.070> a

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:37.100 
filter of our standard dry I also make a

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:40.360 
filter of our standard dry I also make a
pre-filter<00:03:37.580> which<00:03:38.030> is<00:03:38.209> a<00:03:38.239> filter<00:03:38.739> baggy<00:03:39.739> as<00:03:40.100> I

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:40.370 
pre-filter which is a filter baggy as I

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:42.640 
pre-filter which is a filter baggy as I
want<00:03:40.610> to<00:03:40.730> refer<00:03:41.209> to<00:03:41.239> it<00:03:41.420> and<00:03:41.660> it<00:03:42.110> says<00:03:42.290> simply

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:42.650 
want to refer to it and it says simply

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:44.860 
want to refer to it and it says simply
it<00:03:43.160> goes<00:03:43.310> over<00:03:43.610> the<00:03:43.700> filter<00:03:43.940> so<00:03:44.510> it<00:03:44.600> gives<00:03:44.750> you

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:44.870 
it goes over the filter so it gives you

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:46.509 
it goes over the filter so it gives you
another<00:03:45.019> layer<00:03:45.230> protection<00:03:45.680> so<00:03:46.280> if<00:03:46.400> I'm

00:03:46.509 --> 00:03:46.519 
another layer protection so if I'm

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:47.979 
another layer protection so if I'm
off-roading<00:03:47.000> and<00:03:47.300> I<00:03:47.390> don't<00:03:47.570> want<00:03:47.780> to<00:03:47.870> use<00:03:47.959> a

ProGuard seven but I want a little bit
more<00:03:49.670> extra<00:03:49.880> protection<00:03:50.300> I<00:03:50.450> can<00:03:50.810> use<00:03:50.930> a

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:50.959 
more extra protection I can use a

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:53.199 
more extra protection I can use a
pre-filter<00:03:51.550> pre-filters<00:03:52.550> come<00:03:52.760> in<00:03:52.880> yellow

one piece is you don't have to bolt a

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:20.439 
one piece is you don't have to bolt a
bunch<00:04:18.500> of<00:04:18.620> pieces<00:04:18.949> together<00:04:19.130> and<00:04:19.609> at<00:04:20.269> that

bunch of pieces together and at that

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:21.699 
bunch of pieces together and at that
point<00:04:20.720> in<00:04:20.840> time<00:04:20.870> sometimes<00:04:21.199> you'll<00:04:21.530> see
