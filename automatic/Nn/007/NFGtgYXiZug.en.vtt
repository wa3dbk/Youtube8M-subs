 opposite side of the defense to 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:49.840
 get a space and vital and define 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:52.900
 on the opposite side let's see the 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:56.530
 repeat here how am I doing the 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:58.240
 uncheck the line of four defenses I 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:02.530
 tried to put in the center and there the 

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:04.320
 control that breaks the defense and arming 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:09.460
 the very fast shot to the opposite side 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:11.710
 we are adjusting found to the maximum 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:15.720
 to the stick, well, how good is the echo davor 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:15.720
 suker fitch 21 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:23.229
 come that we can not tie that we have 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.490
 to go for the league good pass good pass 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:25.780
 it's not out of the game it's not going to 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:28.450
 try to make the death pass not 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:32.619
 I'm going to throw it, I'm going to dedicate myself to it 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:34.420
 He took the goalkeeper's foot to avoid the 

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:36.670
 goal of davor suker cis as and endure 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:40.780
 the defender fixed I pulled very forced 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:43.479
 I was grabbing the defender and let's go 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:47.530
 to see the corner if we can go to 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:50.369
 top off there goes there we go almost 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:54.810
 I make classic pipes and head pipe 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:54.810
 in the window nothing nothing 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:00.220
 we are still fighting here at the beginning of 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.590
 match 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:05.149
 we go good and we give it back yes yes yes 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.619
 Yours and miles we've made we're going to 

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:09.890
 enter only we endured here a 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:12.190
 little bit and it comes to me very well defined 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:15.739
 goal goal goal goal goal by davor suker fitch 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:19.250
 first goal of the game in foreign field 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:20.680
 here causing the ultras to 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:24.170
 come he has given there he has given it back 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:26.599
 and the defense is gone crazy and in the 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.790
 highway here I stopped 

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:30.560
 practically trying and endure 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:33.760
 until the last moment the goalkeeper and 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.760
 we have defined fantastic 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:39.130
 10 is good but we can get 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:43.270
 another goal here came in alone came alone and the 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:46.360
 pass the game the goal assist me have 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:48.220
 given to double with davor suker 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:51.480
 city we are also playing with the 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:51.480
 team that went second 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:56.680
 in the table so let's get away 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:58.660
 enough more let's be leaders in 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:02.020
 solitary let's see the repetition 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:05.950
 because it's been pretty good 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:08.530
 let's see here the pass that they make 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:11.740
 incredible uncheck by band 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:13.540
 right and I already tried to center it 

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:16.210
 the ball is a little behind but 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:19.290
 well just enough to get in and 

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:21.420
 define second goal of labor 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:24.269
 come that 0 0 is not good you have to 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:26.189
 mark as soon as possible my own if 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:28.739
 lamela give it to me I'm not going to define it 

00:03:26.189 --> 00:03:30.959
 no no no no no and the bounce is the bounce 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:33.510
 of head and goal goal goal goal goal of davor 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:35.970
 suker cit's we've had here pretty 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:37.379
 luck had to have crossed I think 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:40.980
 the ball to the opposite side 

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:44.069
 but tried to define fast we're going to 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:47.129
 see it here that well I'm going to the center 

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:50.040
 and I uncheck entered only attempt to 

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:52.409
 put it on the short stick but the goalkeeper 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:55.609
 to give the bubbler and header 

00:03:52.409 --> 00:03:55.609
 what is goal 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:00.790
 good good and cutting head tried 

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:02.920
 and uncheck me yes yes yeah you see tucked 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:08.890
 the foot and I will define the goal goal goal 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:11.620
 goal 2-0 to the team this weird for 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:15.250
 try to secure three more points for 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:17.530
 the league and that escapes another goal more 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:19.060
 to try to attack the top scorer with 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:20.830
 davor suker cis let's see the 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:23.230
 repetition in the jump here we the 

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:26.110
 we bounce our man who is 

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:29.200
 the link takes it I start the uncheck 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:31.300
 very well he does it and he leaves it to me to pleasure 

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:32.620
 in the penalty point to be able to put 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:35.410
 the 2-0 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:38.590
 me in davos well super six that comes 

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:42.030
 he dribbles and he gives me control of 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:42.030
 first if we cross 

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:47.999
 and we are going to leave the classification here 

00:04:44.699 --> 00:04:51.300
 as we are at the moment not of points that 

00:04:47.999 --> 00:04:53.009
 we take the second in the league we go very 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:55.289
 highlighted when we are almost at 

00:04:53.009 --> 00:04:57.120
 half of season we will see in 

00:04:55.289 --> 00:05:00.210
 scorers if we are already close to the 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:02.909
 top scorer and if we are tied at 12 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:05.039
 goals to 12 goals in the top scorer and 

00:05:02.909 --> 00:05:07.740
 welsch otan who is from our team 

00:05:05.039 --> 00:05:09.539
 has 7 goals we will see also the 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:12.479
 assists although I think I have not done 

00:05:09.539 --> 00:05:15.150
 many lately to see the first 

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:17.930

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:20.969
 has four and we have two 

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:22.469
 tied with paulo bani and I say goodbye 

00:05:20.969 --> 00:05:24.360
