getting a little bit harder just be

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.010

gonna get hit a lot in this level
it's<00:00:51.930> really<00:00:52.530> difficult<00:00:52.770> to<00:00:53.070> avoid<00:00:53.370> some<00:00:53.730> of

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
it's really difficult to avoid some of

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.310 
it's really difficult to avoid some of
the<00:00:53.910> enemies<00:00:54.059> because<00:00:54.510> they're<00:00:54.930> they're

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
the enemies because they're they're

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.450 
the enemies because they're they're
right<00:00:55.559> on<00:00:55.590> you<00:00:55.949> from<00:00:56.280> from<00:00:57.210> when<00:00:57.719> you<00:00:57.870> spawn<00:00:58.460> so

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
right on you from from when you spawn so

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.810 
right on you from from when you spawn so
I<00:00:59.489> would<00:00:59.930> recommend<00:01:00.930> picking<00:01:01.680> her<00:01:02.430> on<00:01:02.640> it

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
I would recommend picking her on it

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.399 
I would recommend picking her on it
because<00:01:03.149> she's<00:01:03.449> got<00:01:03.690> high<00:01:04.760> power<00:01:06.140> which<00:01:07.140> means

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
because she's got high power which means

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.920 
because she's got high power which means
she<00:01:07.530> could<00:01:07.619> take<00:01:07.799> more<00:01:07.979> hits<00:01:08.040> and<00:01:08.720> that<00:01:09.720> little

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
she could take more hits and that little

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.469 
she could take more hits and that little
thing<00:01:10.020> that<00:01:10.260> I<00:01:10.439> just<00:01:10.530> used<00:01:11.520> to<00:01:11.729> grind<00:01:12.060> over

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
thing that I just used to grind over

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.390 
thing that I just used to grind over
that<00:01:12.659> fence<00:01:12.930> is<00:01:13.200> really<00:01:13.530> useful<00:01:14.040> because<00:01:14.159> a

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
that fence is really useful because a

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.340 
that fence is really useful because a
lot<00:01:14.670> of<00:01:14.700> the<00:01:14.880> spray<00:01:15.150> cans<00:01:15.450> are<00:01:15.720> in<00:01:15.810> this<00:01:15.930> bottom

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
lot of the spray cans are in this bottom

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.969 
lot of the spray cans are in this bottom
area<00:01:16.530> if<00:01:16.740> you<00:01:17.070> and<00:01:18.110> there's<00:01:19.110> actually<00:01:19.590> kind<00:01:19.830> of

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
area if you and there's actually kind of

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.719 
area if you and there's actually kind of
a<00:01:20.040> lot<00:01:20.189> of<00:01:20.220> tags<00:01:20.640> here<00:01:21.119> so<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:21.869> order<00:01:22.290> that<00:01:22.470> you

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:22.729 
a lot of tags here so the order that you

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:26.899 
a lot of tags here so the order that you
hit<00:01:23.729> them<00:01:23.939> in<00:01:24.150> isn't<00:01:24.659> that<00:01:25.700> important<00:01:26.700> but

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
hit them in isn't that important but

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.210 
hit them in isn't that important but
you'll<00:01:27.240> see<00:01:27.570> here<00:01:27.780> I<00:01:27.840> actually<00:01:28.140> just<00:01:28.590> avoided

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
you'll see here I actually just avoided

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.540 
you'll see here I actually just avoided
that<00:01:29.430> row<00:01:29.610> of<00:01:29.640> tags<00:01:30.060> all

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:30.550 
that row of tags all

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:32.070 
that row of tags all
together<00:01:30.700> because<00:01:31.120> I'm<00:01:31.270> gonna<00:01:31.420> go<00:01:31.660> hit<00:01:31.870> them

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:32.080 
together because I'm gonna go hit them

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.580 
together because I'm gonna go hit them
later<00:01:32.320> this<00:01:32.800> building<00:01:33.700> here<00:01:33.940> is<00:01:34.030> another

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
later this building here is another

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.010 
later this building here is another
another<00:01:35.590> good<00:01:35.890> thing<00:01:36.160> you<00:01:36.310> can<00:01:36.490> use<00:01:36.790> a<00:01:37.270> lot<00:01:37.900> of

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:38.020 
another good thing you can use a lot of

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:39.090 
another good thing you can use a lot of
people<00:01:38.260> don't<00:01:38.380> even<00:01:38.500> know<00:01:38.680> about<00:01:38.860> this

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:39.100 
people don't even know about this

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.910 
people don't even know about this
building<00:01:39.550> but<00:01:40.240> what<00:01:40.510> you<00:01:40.630> can<00:01:40.810> do<00:01:40.960> is<00:01:41.200> you<00:01:41.650> can

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:41.920 
building but what you can do is you can

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.940 
building but what you can do is you can
actually<00:01:42.310> go<00:01:42.700> up<00:01:42.880> there's<00:01:43.690> some<00:01:43.960> health<00:01:44.530> pans

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:44.950 
actually go up there's some health pans

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:46.590 
actually go up there's some health pans
over<00:01:45.250> here<00:01:45.460> but<00:01:45.640> if<00:01:45.730> you<00:01:45.820> go<00:01:46.000> up<00:01:46.030> all<00:01:46.420> the<00:01:46.450> way

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:46.600 
over here but if you go up all the way

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:52.380 
over here but if you go up all the way
to<00:01:46.750> the<00:01:48.120> the<00:01:49.120> top<00:01:49.420> level<00:01:49.930> I<00:01:51.270> recommend<00:01:52.270> going

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:52.390 
to the the top level I recommend going

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:54.060 
to the the top level I recommend going
all<00:01:52.660> the<00:01:52.780> way<00:01:52.810> to<00:01:52.930> the<00:01:53.110> top<00:01:53.320> don't<00:01:53.680> jump<00:01:53.890> out<00:01:54.010> of

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:54.070 
all the way to the top don't jump out of

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:56.310 
all the way to the top don't jump out of
the<00:01:54.280> smaller<00:01:54.760> windows<00:01:55.150> go<00:01:55.780> up<00:01:55.840> to<00:01:55.960> the<00:01:56.050> top

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:56.320 
the smaller windows go up to the top

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:00.210 
the smaller windows go up to the top
level<00:01:56.590> and<00:01:56.890> jump<00:01:57.160> off<00:01:57.370> and<00:01:57.990> you'll<00:01:58.990> avoid<00:01:59.410> the

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:00.220 
level and jump off and you'll avoid the

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:02.220 
level and jump off and you'll avoid the
guys<00:02:00.400> chasing<00:02:00.730> you<00:02:01.030> and<00:02:01.090> you'll<00:02:01.360> also<00:02:01.510> come

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:04.660 
back up to this rooftop area where there

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:08.700 
back up to this rooftop area where there
is<00:02:04.930> a<00:02:04.960> lot<00:02:05.380> of<00:02:06.030> medium-sized<00:02:07.410> pieces<00:02:08.410> of

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:08.710 
is a lot of medium-sized pieces of

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:11.880 
is a lot of medium-sized pieces of
graffiti<00:02:08.860> that<00:02:09.340> you<00:02:09.460> need<00:02:09.610> to<00:02:09.730> spray<00:02:10.440> so<00:02:11.440> again

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
graffiti that you need to spray so again

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:15.750 
graffiti that you need to spray so again
you<00:02:12.520> know<00:02:12.640> the<00:02:12.850> approach<00:02:13.660> I<00:02:13.930> took<00:02:14.760> didn't

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
you know the approach I took didn't

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.080 
you know the approach I took didn't
necessarily<00:02:15.970> work<00:02:16.570> out<00:02:17.400> the<00:02:18.400> exact<00:02:18.790> way<00:02:18.820> I

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
necessarily work out the exact way I

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:20.640 
necessarily work out the exact way I
wanted<00:02:19.540> it<00:02:19.660> just<00:02:19.900> because<00:02:20.230> of<00:02:20.380> the<00:02:20.470> guys

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
wanted it just because of the guys

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.160 
wanted it just because of the guys
chasing<00:02:21.100> me<00:02:21.430> so<00:02:21.760> I<00:02:21.790> had<00:02:22.150> to<00:02:22.180> sort<00:02:22.540> of<00:02:22.690> improvise

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
chasing me so I had to sort of improvise

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.050 
chasing me so I had to sort of improvise
and<00:02:24.030> run<00:02:25.030> around<00:02:25.120> the<00:02:25.360> map<00:02:25.540> a<00:02:25.600> little<00:02:25.720> bit<00:02:26.140> but

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
and run around the map a little bit but

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.990 
and run around the map a little bit but
you<00:02:28.060> still<00:02:28.360> have<00:02:28.570> enough<00:02:29.400> enough<00:02:30.400> leeway<00:02:30.730> to

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
you still have enough enough leeway to

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.770 
you still have enough enough leeway to
get<00:02:31.450> jet<00:02:31.750> even<00:02:32.140> if<00:02:32.290> you<00:02:32.560> don't<00:02:33.370> make<00:02:33.550> the<00:02:33.940> exact

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
get jet even if you don't make the exact

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:37.590 
get jet even if you don't make the exact
perfect<00:02:35.320> run<00:02:35.850> so<00:02:36.850> just<00:02:37.060> be<00:02:37.209> aware<00:02:37.450> of<00:02:37.510> that

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:37.600 
perfect run so just be aware of that

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.800 
perfect run so just be aware of that
okay<00:02:38.470> so<00:02:38.530> I<00:02:39.010> just<00:02:39.520> finished<00:02:39.970> that<00:02:40.270> rooftop

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
okay so I just finished that rooftop

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:44.190 
okay so I just finished that rooftop
area<00:02:41.410> completely<00:02:42.540> and<00:02:43.540> there's<00:02:43.840> two<00:02:44.050> more

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200 
area completely and there's two more

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.520 
area completely and there's two more
areas<00:02:44.550> one

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
areas one

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.780 
areas one
is<00:02:47.069> the<00:02:47.520> area<00:02:48.920> over<00:02:49.920> here<00:02:49.950> what<00:02:50.400> that<00:02:50.640> you're

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
is the area over here what that you're

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.320 
is the area over here what that you're
looking<00:02:51.060> at<00:02:51.180> right<00:02:51.390> now<00:02:52.400> it's<00:02:53.400> like<00:02:53.730> a<00:02:53.790> second

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
looking at right now it's like a second

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:56.090 
looking at right now it's like a second
rooftop<00:02:54.720> area<00:02:55.110> I<00:02:55.170> guess<00:02:55.470> you'd<00:02:55.650> call<00:02:55.680> it<00:02:55.920> I

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
rooftop area I guess you'd call it I

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:57.620 
rooftop area I guess you'd call it I
actually<00:02:56.280> missed<00:02:56.730> the<00:02:56.880> jump<00:02:57.120> here<00:02:57.390> so<00:02:57.600> I

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
actually missed the jump here so I

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:01.250 
actually missed the jump here so I
decide<00:02:58.370> screw<00:02:59.370> it<00:02:59.520> we<00:03:00.510> need<00:03:00.660> to<00:03:00.780> hit<00:03:00.930> the<00:03:01.050> rest

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
decide screw it we need to hit the rest

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.280 
decide screw it we need to hit the rest
of<00:03:01.380> these<00:03:01.470> streets<00:03:01.890> so<00:03:02.730> there<00:03:03.720> are<00:03:03.810> two<00:03:03.989> tags

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
of these streets so there are two tags

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:08.780 
of these streets so there are two tags
here<00:03:04.709> along<00:03:05.160> the<00:03:05.370> Main<00:03:05.640> Street<00:03:06.090> and<00:03:07.670> after<00:03:08.670> you

00:03:14.809 --> 00:03:14.819 
smaller tags on the the very side of the

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:17.380 
smaller tags on the the very side of the

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:27.830

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:41.240 
depending on when the trains come you

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:43.179 
depending on when the trains come you
could<00:04:41.479> potentially<00:04:41.840> get<00:04:42.379> hit<00:04:42.590> by<00:04:42.740> a<00:04:42.770> train<00:04:43.159> in
