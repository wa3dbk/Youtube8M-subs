00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:34.850 
one-and-two all right it's a little bit

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:36.040 
one-and-two all right it's a little bit
awkward<00:02:35.060> when<00:02:35.360> you<00:02:35.450> don't<00:02:35.630> have<00:02:35.750> to<00:02:35.900> balance

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050 
awkward when you don't have to balance

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:37.870 
awkward when you don't have to balance
in<00:02:36.320> there<00:02:36.470> but<00:02:36.920> putting<00:02:37.160> everything<00:02:37.580> together

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
in there but putting everything together

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:42.040 
in there but putting everything together
it<00:02:38.570> will<00:02:38.750> have<00:02:38.930> these<00:02:39.230> bounce<00:02:40.300> the<00:02:41.300> lift<00:02:41.840> and

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.050 
it will have these bounce the lift and

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:45.790 
it will have these bounce the lift and
lift<00:02:42.830> and<00:02:43.100> the<00:02:43.520> other<00:02:43.670> foot<00:02:43.940> lift<00:02:44.510> and<00:02:44.750> lift<00:02:45.350> so

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:45.800 
lift and the other foot lift and lift so

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:49.449 
lift and the other foot lift and lift so
the<00:02:45.830> pattern<00:02:46.310> is<00:02:46.580> out<00:02:47.300> in<00:02:48.080> other<00:02:48.500> foot<00:02:48.860> out<00:02:49.190> and

00:02:49.449 --> 00:02:49.459 
the pattern is out in other foot out and

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:53.640 
the pattern is out in other foot out and
in<00:02:50.110> just<00:02:51.110> 24<00:02:51.820> one-and-two<00:02:52.820> one-and-two

together so we're going to get started

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:02.380 
together so we're going to get started
with<00:03:00.500> the<00:03:00.739> balance<00:03:01.130> so<00:03:01.580> everything<00:03:02.090> has<00:03:02.239> to

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:02.390 
with the balance so everything has to

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:04.210 
with the balance so everything has to
balance<00:03:02.570> in<00:03:02.810> there<00:03:02.989> and<00:03:03.230> once<00:03:03.500> we<00:03:03.680> get<00:03:03.860> into<00:03:04.100> a

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:04.220 
balance in there and once we get into a

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:06.160 
balance in there and once we get into a
temple<00:03:04.760> i'm<00:03:05.060> going<00:03:05.420> to<00:03:05.480> start<00:03:05.690> listing<00:03:06.019> my
