idea<00:05:17.540> of<00:05:17.680> eating<00:05:18.680> right<00:05:18.889> getting<00:05:19.220> good

00:05:19.719 --> 00:05:19.729 
idea of eating right getting good

00:05:19.729 --> 00:05:21.820 
idea of eating right getting good
nutrition<00:05:20.050> getting<00:05:21.050> off<00:05:21.199> the<00:05:21.350> couch<00:05:21.500> and

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:21.830 
nutrition getting off the couch and

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:23.620 
nutrition getting off the couch and
getting<00:05:22.250> physical<00:05:22.639> activity<00:05:23.120> and<00:05:23.270> I<00:05:23.600> think

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:23.630 
getting physical activity and I think

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:25.510 
getting physical activity and I think
