00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
like it's lighting up with 1080p I could

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.420 
like it's lighting up with 1080p I could
tell<00:00:48.539> because<00:00:48.690> my<00:00:48.989> resolution<00:00:49.649> here<00:00:49.920> changed

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
port on the right there so that's why

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.869

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
have the ability to run power we could

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.450 
have the ability to run power we could
do<00:01:02.520> AV<00:01:03.090> to<00:01:03.359> our<00:01:03.480> TV<00:01:03.899> or<00:01:04.019> monitor<00:01:04.229> and<00:01:04.680> have<00:01:05.070> data

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460
