00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:08.880
 hello to all for a long time in the mine 

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:10.620
 there was such a team as their zikil 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.510
 but still for some reason on many 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.250
 raises questions and today I want 

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:16.650
 consider one of her ways 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.840
 applying them actually 2 on the second 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.360
 it will be like some other time so 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.980
 let's start with a theory and a small example of how 

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:25.199
 you can see in front of me is not big 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.270
 pen in which a lot of creeper that is 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.039
 if i switch to survival mode then 

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:31.800
 it will create a big problem 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:34.680
 however this is not a problem let's turn on 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.899
 our mechanism and steve didn't actually wash 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.660
 Moscow for several months from such 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:42.120
 stench relax not only Cooney turn 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.250
 survival mode and go ahead as you 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.410
 can see creeper simply die 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.600
 with our approximation that is not even 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.180
 time to explode let's turn off 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.480
 mechanism go back to these mode 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.090
 him 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.190
 and get down and big theory in lane 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.230
 There are quite a few teams that 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.539
 performed relative to some kind. 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.000
 that is, all the command calculations go from 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:05.759
 points and performing such points on the very 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.430
 business 2 1. this is a command block where 

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:10.410
 the team worked and 2. this game 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.569
 let's say we have the simplest team 

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:15.420
 set block which will leave a stone for 2 

00:01:12.569 --> 00:01:16.649
 block above let's and immediately copy if 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.750
 we do it in the command block 

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:20.910
 attacks and appears above the command 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.520
 by block i.e. the countdown comes from here 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:25.500
 if this execution command is a stone 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.130
 already appears above me that is above 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.530
 by player 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.289
 but let's say we need to put a stone on 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.450
 2 of that armor stand we do it and 

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:35.280
 we can armor itself can not 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.500
 execute commands and of course not 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.300
 is a command block to get around 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.789
 we will need this restriction 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:44.250
 team of their zikil let's see how 

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:47.160
 it's done and so we have a team 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:49.020
 executor tori and essentially choosing a point 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:51.450
 regarding which will be performed 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:54.209
 actions that is, and will spot we are looking 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.800
 some entity within a radius of 25 essence 

00:01:54.209 --> 00:01:57.959
 there must be a rack for armor and 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:00.450
 relative to the coordinates of the entity 

00:01:57.959 --> 00:02:02.729
 we run the same set command 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.160
 block offset two up let's 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:07.200
 check it execute the command and stone 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:09.599
 we got above the armor stand then 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.670
 there is essentially a command from the secret helps 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:13.590
 us choose a place for which 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:16.230
 we will do all our calculations 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.160
 perform all our commands very simple 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.560
 principle well and now let's refund 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.690
 all to our mechanism and see how 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.820
 it works 1 time early video I him 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:27.160
 showed it is necessary to consider the mechanism 

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:29.380
 as you see the same is very simple and so 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:31.510
 login rata which gives a signal for 2 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:34.180
 command blocks in the first command block 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:37.180
 we certainly team whipped which 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:40.150
 looking for players and relative to their ignat 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:42.280
 executes the kilt command and kill the command 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:45.160
 and the moon with the following constraint in 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:47.410
 radius 4 she searches for creeper and kills 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:49.480
 only they will die only 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:51.910
 creepers who approached the graph 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:54.160
 closer than 4 blocks well and second 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:56.680
 command block is also quite simple 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:59.140
 team again and cricket we are looking 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:01.360
 players and relative to players shifting 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:03.490
 one down we cause an effect 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.170
 particles in this case are effects 

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:07.360
 critical damage well and accordingly 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:09.910
 move one block up as you 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:12.070
 You see, these two offsets cancel 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:14.010
 each other initially we descend on 

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:16.720
 one block below and from this point 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:19.180
 we rise 1 block higher that is in 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:21.730
 general case what is here what are we 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:23.980
 can indicate our offset this in 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:25.660
 principle is equivalent that is summing up 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:27.670
 small team total score 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:30.340
 really helps us solve 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:32.200
 displacement issue the command we 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:34.810
 execute the command as to 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:36.760
 an object that we need in any case 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:39.070
 I hope that this mechanism and this 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:41.140
 an explanation you liked and helped a 

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:43.420
 on this for today, thank you very much 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:46.090
