00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:45.720 
can approach this note or how you can
use<00:00:43.840> this<00:00:43.989> note<00:00:44.260> when<00:00:44.860> you're<00:00:45.040> playing<00:00:45.489> lead

guitar<00:00:47.250> what<00:00:48.250> I've<00:00:48.370> showed<00:00:48.519> me<00:00:48.670> there<00:00:48.820> is<00:00:49.089> the

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:49.420 
guitar what I've showed me there is the

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:57.760 
guitar what I've showed me there is the
first<00:00:49.900> note<00:00:50.199> of<00:00:50.230> the<00:00:50.470> scale<00:00:50.589> the

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:01.400 

d<00:00:58.770> we've<00:00:59.700> got<00:01:00.090> the<00:01:00.210> guitar<00:01:00.300> and<00:01:00.570> drop<00:01:00.900> D<00:01:01.200> which

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
d we've got the guitar and drop D which

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.260 
d we've got the guitar and drop D which
means<00:01:01.620> we've<00:01:01.770> got<00:01:01.980> everything<00:01:02.520> tunes<00:01:02.820> in<00:01:03.090> with

means we've got everything tunes in with

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.600 
means we've got everything tunes in with
the<00:01:03.360> E<00:01:03.510> string<00:01:03.990> the<00:01:04.140> low<00:01:04.320> E<00:01:04.350> string<00:01:04.500> tune<00:01:05.430> down

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
the E string the low E string tune down

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:12.100 
the E string the low E string tune down
to<00:01:05.790> a<00:01:05.850> d

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.110 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.310 

I<00:01:13.360> don't<00:01:14.360> have<00:01:14.450> to<00:01:14.570> have<00:01:14.690> it<00:01:14.780> in<00:01:14.870> this<00:01:14.960> tuning

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:15.320 
I don't have to have it in this tuning

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.560 
I don't have to have it in this tuning
it<00:01:15.410> just<00:01:15.620> helpfully<00:01:15.980> example<00:01:16.370> our<00:01:16.460> own<00:01:16.790> you<00:01:16.970> so

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:17.570 
it just helpfully example our own you so

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:18.880 
it just helpfully example our own you so
we're<00:01:17.780> starting<00:01:18.110> the<00:01:18.200> first<00:01:18.440> load<00:01:18.740> of<00:01:18.860> the

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:18.890 
we're starting the first load of the

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:24.400 
we're starting the first load of the
scale<00:01:22.480> assessment<00:01:23.480> presumes<00:01:23.780> you<00:01:23.960> know<00:01:24.200> the

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:24.410 
scale assessment presumes you know the

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:26.470 
scale assessment presumes you know the
major<00:01:24.590> scale<00:01:24.830> so<00:01:25.490> if<00:01:25.610> you<00:01:25.730> don't<00:01:25.850> perhaps<00:01:26.330> you

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:26.480 
major scale so if you don't perhaps you

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:28.090 
major scale so if you don't perhaps you
should<00:01:26.510> go<00:01:26.780> away<00:01:26.930> have<00:01:27.320> a<00:01:27.350> look<00:01:27.470> at<00:01:27.560> that<00:01:27.680> and

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:28.100 
should go away have a look at that and

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.310 
should go away have a look at that and
then<00:01:28.430> come<00:01:28.610> back<00:01:28.640> to<00:01:28.820> us<00:01:28.970> the<00:01:29.630> first<00:01:29.840> note<00:01:30.050> and

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:30.320 
then come back to us the first note and

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:35.710 
then come back to us the first note and
the<00:01:30.680> day<00:01:30.950> scale<00:01:31.310> is<00:01:31.520> the<00:01:31.820> denote<00:01:34.510> just<00:01:35.510> one<00:01:35.630> of

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:35.720 
the day scale is the denote just one of

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:37.360 
the day scale is the denote just one of
the<00:01:35.780> really<00:01:35.900> simple<00:01:36.590> things<00:01:36.770> that<00:01:36.920> your<00:01:37.070> tarts

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:37.370 
the really simple things that your tarts

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:44.920 
the really simple things that your tarts
do<00:01:37.640> is<00:01:37.880> they<00:01:38.150> rule<00:01:38.450> from<00:01:38.780> underneath<00:01:39.140> it<00:01:43.930> this

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:44.930 
do is they rule from underneath it this

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:46.780 
do is they rule from underneath it this
helps<00:01:45.200> if<00:01:45.320> you've<00:01:45.440> got<00:01:45.650> a<00:01:45.680> note<00:01:45.920> that<00:01:46.400> is<00:01:46.640> an

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:46.790 
helps if you've got a note that is an

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:48.730 
helps if you've got a note that is an
open<00:01:47.119> string<00:01:47.360> so<00:01:47.720> for<00:01:48.170> example<00:01:48.259> what<00:01:48.650> we're

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:48.740 
open string so for example what we're

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.340 
open string so for example what we're
doing<00:01:48.950> here<00:01:49.190> we're<00:01:50.090> coming<00:01:50.360> up<00:01:50.479> from<00:01:50.930> the<00:01:50.990> 4th

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:51.350 
doing here we're coming up from the 4th

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:56.740 
doing here we're coming up from the 4th
to<00:01:51.440> the<00:01:51.530> 5th<00:01:54.040> which<00:01:55.040> is<00:01:55.190> one<00:01:55.520> pic<00:01:55.790> stroke<00:01:56.119> it

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:56.750 
to the 5th which is one pic stroke it

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:58.660 
to the 5th which is one pic stroke it
down<00:01:56.960> stroke<00:01:57.320> an<00:01:57.470> hour<00:01:57.649> on<00:01:57.860> from<00:01:58.160> four<00:01:58.460> to<00:01:58.580> the

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:58.670 
down stroke an hour on from four to the

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:01.050 
down stroke an hour on from four to the
fifth

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:01.060 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:04.830 

on<00:02:01.390> the<00:02:01.630> next<00:02:01.840> string<00:02:02.350> is<00:02:02.799> the<00:02:03.070> D<00:02:03.220> string<00:02:03.840> see

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
on the next string is the D string see

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:11.070 
on the next string is the D string see
note<00:02:06.240> so<00:02:07.240> you're<00:02:07.390> going<00:02:09.179> so<00:02:10.179> it's<00:02:10.330> 4th<00:02:10.690> to<00:02:10.869> 5th

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
note so you're going so it's 4th to 5th

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:18.589 
note so you're going so it's 4th to 5th
on<00:02:11.349> the<00:02:11.410> a<00:02:11.650> string<00:02:14.310> delap<00:02:15.310> on<00:02:15.640> the<00:02:15.819> D<00:02:15.970> string

00:02:18.589 --> 00:02:18.599 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:20.790 

that's<00:02:19.599> a<00:02:19.720> particular<00:02:20.019> part<00:02:20.380> that<00:02:20.590> you<00:02:20.650> want

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:20.800 
that's a particular part that you want

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:29.729 
that's a particular part that you want
to<00:02:20.860> get<00:02:21.010> bit<00:02:21.280> faster<00:02:21.760> I'd<00:02:28.440> sooner<00:02:29.440> did<00:02:29.590> that

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:29.739 
to get bit faster I'd sooner did that

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:31.890 
to get bit faster I'd sooner did that
was<00:02:29.830> just<00:02:29.980> the<00:02:30.130> same<00:02:30.430> thing<00:02:30.700> 4th<00:02:31.239> to<00:02:31.420> 5th<00:02:31.599> and

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
was just the same thing 4th to 5th and

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.590 
was just the same thing 4th to 5th and
in<00:02:32.019> the<00:02:32.110> next<00:02:32.230> string<00:02:32.500> up<00:02:33.360> that's<00:02:34.360> on<00:02:34.510> the

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:34.600 
in the next string up that's on the

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:38.100 
in the next string up that's on the
table<00:02:34.780> come<00:02:35.200> after<00:02:35.440> that<00:02:35.560> so<00:02:36.690> quick<00:02:37.690> hint<00:02:37.900> for

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
table come after that so quick hint for

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:39.600 
table come after that so quick hint for
this<00:02:38.200> lesson<00:02:38.410> is<00:02:38.680> that<00:02:38.980> if<00:02:39.280> you're<00:02:39.459> playing

this lesson is that if you're playing

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:41.220 
this lesson is that if you're playing
first<00:02:40.030> note<00:02:40.360> of<00:02:40.390> the<00:02:40.600> scale<00:02:40.720> one<00:02:41.049> of<00:02:41.140> the

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
first note of the scale one of the

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:42.930 
first note of the scale one of the
things<00:02:41.380> you<00:02:41.470> can<00:02:41.590> do<00:02:41.709> is<00:02:41.950> roll<00:02:42.489> up<00:02:42.670> to<00:02:42.790> it<00:02:42.910> and

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940 
things you can do is roll up to it and

things you can do is roll up to it and
use<00:02:43.330> the<00:02:43.360> open<00:02:43.989> string<00:02:48.810> using<00:02:49.810> the<00:02:50.019> same<00:02:50.319> idea

00:02:50.759 --> 00:02:50.769 
use the open string using the same idea

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:53.880 
use the open string using the same idea
you<00:02:51.430> can<00:02:51.670> do<00:02:51.940> this<00:02:52.150> with<00:02:52.209> Gene<00:02:52.989> particularly<00:02:53.620> G

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 
you can do this with Gene particularly G

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:57.690 
you can do this with Gene particularly G
because<00:02:54.340> you've<00:02:54.489> got<00:02:54.700> that<00:02:54.910> lovely<00:02:55.319> G<00:02:56.319> note<00:02:56.700> g
