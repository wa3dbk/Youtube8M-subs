00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:23.170
 our researchers have analyzed the 

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:24.520
 altair life and see the aha as 

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:26.380
 hope to find a biography that 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:28.060
 can serve as a positive model for 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:30.220
 global programs to attract 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:32.950
 I abstain unfortunately this murderer 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:34.570
 renegade does not serve many of his 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:36.220
 sequences show a man that 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:38.290
 renounce some of the most taboos 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:41.879
 rooted in their culture with a 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:41.879
 almost messianic arrogance 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:49.150
 many of our researchers 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:51.610
 they considered the arguments 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:53.140
 articulated by the rival of altair un 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:55.390
 man we know by the name of 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:57.129
 abbas were clearer and more convincing than 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:58.780
 any of altair 

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:00.610
 recently requested to be located at 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:02.240
 one of the ancestors of abbas if he is 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:04.340
 that there is some 

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:06.290
 it is evident that the transgressions of 

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:07.970
 altair were the main reason for the 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:11.630
 dissolution of the infamous order of the 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:12.650
 murderers in the mid-13th century by 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:15.200
 We strongly recommend it 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:16.640
 forget this resource in favor of another 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.870
 much more pleasant character e 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.870
 inspiring of his time 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:29.270
 our initial reports indicated 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:31.450
 that I auditor would be an ideal candidate 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:33.890
 for future abstergo projects 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.870
 his charisma his magnetism for 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:37.550
 women and sarcastic humor him 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:39.830
 they conferred all the qualities of a 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:41.540
 leader however by breaking it the 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:43.550
 order of the killers lost those 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:45.830
 qualities and plunged more and more into 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:47.930
 a spiral of vengeance often 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:50.090
 edition showed a passive acceptance 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:52.550
 of evil was also a man of 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:54.410
 dangerous contradictions preached the 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:56.150
 freedom of thought but I traveled very 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:58.610
 away from your country to proselytize 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:00.800
 of his corrupt creed as he is doing 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:02.720
 here with this impressionable Chinese girl 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:04.940
 let's also look at their gestures and 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.210
 manners there is still something of the old lascivious 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:08.550
 at 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:11.160
 the personality of desires is based on the 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:13.290
 purest demagoguery holds that its 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.090
 philosophy is love when violence 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.790
 and coercion are your means to 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.950
 overcome the problems so we have arrived 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.440
 to the conclusion that if auditore gives 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:24.950
 firenze would be a risky resource of 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.950
 develop 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.230
 the preliminary report of abel in the 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.360
 grand pre makes us believe that it would be 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.410
 too controversial and impulsive to 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.870
 the great public 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:42.400
 his teenage memories show his 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:44.890
 brainwashing and training 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:48.010
 to kill political enemies of agate 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:49.480
 his demented mentor also abel in happened 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:52.000
 too much time in the swamps of 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:58.600
 louisiana courting smugglers 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:03:00.460
 low level which would endanger its 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:02.920
 attractive to women who now 

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:04.930
 same is almost 50 percent 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:06.190
 however when abel immature emerged 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:08.350
 a new aspect 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:10.420
 an elegant and elegant polite lady 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:13.390
 compassionate avelina adopts a new 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:15.280
 mentor her stepmom madeleine they'll 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:19.030
 a tireless defender of rights 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:21.250
 of the slaves with a small edition 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:22.690
 to prioritize your relationship we believe that 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:24.550
 the story of abel dissatisfied with 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:26.170
 you grow our needs 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:29.850
 our team recommends giving it light 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:29.850
 green get it out to the market quickly 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:37.670
 our first research on 

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:40.220
 the life of mouse to what ton they focused 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:41.510
 in his twenties but the 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:42.770
 researchers were not very 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:44.960
 impressed by his behavior 

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:47.150
 calm and stoichkov with buds 

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:48.500
 occasional of extreme anger was not the 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:51.080
 kind of leader we would feel 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:53.180
 comfortable supporting so we decided to join 

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:54.740
 in his early childhood with hope 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:57.110
 that the scenes of the America 

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:59.180
 pre-Columbian in certain attractiveness as 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:01.640
 can see here there is a certain candor and 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:03.470
 naivety in this young man for 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:04.910
 Unfortunately the researchers believe that 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:06.740
 the story of this young man also 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:08.450
 presents problems on the one hand the 

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:10.100
 omnipresence of the mojo culture that 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:12.800
 lacks the necessary balance for 

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:14.870
 tell the true story of the USA for 

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:16.580
 across the MONJO language would be without 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:18.830
 doubt an inconvenience for most 

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:20.720
 from the public therefore we believe that although 

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:22.640
 the early times of the mouse life 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:24.800
 what ton could be very interesting 

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:26.180
 for the most educated spectators it is 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:28.100
 unlikely that this story is 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:30.410
 attractive on a large scale is too much 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:32.030
 alien to the common public our 

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:34.270
 team recommends doing without this 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:34.270
 resource
