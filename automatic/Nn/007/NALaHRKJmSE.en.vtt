00:00:58.889 --> 00:00:58.899 

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:00.630 

for<00:00:59.260> this<00:00:59.320> wire<00:00:59.589> I<00:00:59.620> just<00:01:00.010> used<00:01:00.160> some<00:01:00.280> scrap

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:00.640 
for this wire I just used some scrap

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.450 
for this wire I just used some scrap
wire<00:01:00.879> you<00:01:01.359> could<00:01:01.510> probably<00:01:01.750> use<00:01:02.159> from<00:01:03.159> a<00:01:03.280> coat

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:03.460 
wire you could probably use from a coat

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:06.749 
wire you could probably use from a coat
hanger<00:01:03.640> or<00:01:03.940> something<00:01:04.150> like<00:01:04.239> that<00:01:05.670> what<00:01:06.670> I'm

00:01:06.749 --> 00:01:06.759 
hanger or something like that what I'm

00:01:06.759 --> 00:01:10.679 
hanger or something like that what I'm
going<00:01:06.880> to<00:01:06.939> do<00:01:07.060> now<00:01:08.610> is<00:01:09.610> cut<00:01:09.909> little<00:01:10.149> grooves<00:01:10.450> in

00:01:10.679 --> 00:01:10.689 
going to do now is cut little grooves in

00:01:10.689 --> 00:01:15.180 
going to do now is cut little grooves in
here<00:01:10.990> so<00:01:11.500> it<00:01:11.649> sits<00:01:11.920> nice<00:01:12.159> and<00:01:13.920> doesn't<00:01:14.920> fall

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:15.190 
here so it sits nice and doesn't fall

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:21.510 
here so it sits nice and doesn't fall
off<00:01:18.600> while<00:01:19.600> I<00:01:19.690> cut<00:01:19.899> up<00:01:19.990> my<00:01:20.170> grooves<00:01:20.500> for<00:01:21.369> the

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:21.520 
off while I cut up my grooves for the

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:25.440 
off while I cut up my grooves for the
rod<00:01:23.039> but<00:01:24.039> it<00:01:24.460> didn't<00:01:24.759> really<00:01:24.820> sit<00:01:25.180> the<00:01:25.299> way<00:01:25.390> as

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:25.450 
rod but it didn't really sit the way as

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:28.560 
rod but it didn't really sit the way as
liking<00:01:25.840> it<00:01:26.520> so<00:01:27.520> I<00:01:27.580> decided<00:01:27.909> to<00:01:28.000> go<00:01:28.149> with<00:01:28.180> holes

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:28.570 
liking it so I decided to go with holes

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:35.370 
liking it so I decided to go with holes
I<00:01:32.369> drilled<00:01:33.369> holes<00:01:33.970> for<00:01:34.300> the<00:01:34.479> rod<00:01:35.050> to<00:01:35.229> go

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:35.380 
I drilled holes for the rod to go

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:38.249 
I drilled holes for the rod to go
through<00:01:35.649> instead<00:01:36.039> of<00:01:36.159> the<00:01:36.220> grooves<00:01:37.200> it's<00:01:38.200> a

00:01:38.249 --> 00:01:38.259 
through instead of the grooves it's a

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:42.419 
through instead of the grooves it's a
lot<00:01:38.409> more<00:01:38.619> solid<00:01:38.860> I<00:01:40.920> purposely<00:01:41.920> put<00:01:42.039> it<00:01:42.280> on<00:01:42.399> a

00:01:42.419 --> 00:01:42.429 
lot more solid I purposely put it on a

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:45.330 
lot more solid I purposely put it on a
bit<00:01:42.640> of<00:01:42.729> a<00:01:42.819> tilt<00:01:43.679> that's<00:01:44.679> how<00:01:44.799> I<00:01:44.830> want<00:01:45.100> to<00:01:45.159> play
