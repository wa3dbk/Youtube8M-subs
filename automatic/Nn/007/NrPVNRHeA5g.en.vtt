it's going in my Universal centuries
section<00:06:29.910> once<00:06:30.180> I<00:06:30.300> have<00:06:30.900> more<00:06:31.440> Universal

00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:46.700 
universal century model but

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:48.650 
universal century model but
unfortunately<00:06:47.700> it's<00:06:47.850> on<00:06:48.030> hold<00:06:48.360> right<00:06:48.600> now

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:48.660 
unfortunately it's on hold right now

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:52.780 
unfortunately it's on hold right now
because<00:06:49.140> i<00:06:49.350> need<00:06:49.950> glue<00:06:50.250> that<00:06:51.150> thing<00:06:51.510> sucks

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:52.790 
because i need glue that thing sucks

00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:57.080 
because i need glue that thing sucks
unfortunately<00:06:54.860> early<00:06:55.860> and<00:06:56.070> it's<00:06:56.460> unfortunate

00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:57.090 
unfortunately early and it's unfortunate

00:06:57.090 --> 00:06:58.370 
unfortunately early and it's unfortunate
but<00:06:57.150> it<00:06:57.270> sucks<00:06:57.600> putting<00:06:57.930> that<00:06:58.020> one<00:06:58.230> together

00:06:58.370 --> 00:06:58.380
