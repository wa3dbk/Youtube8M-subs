here for the microphone I want to hear
anyone<00:02:18.690> here<00:02:18.900> I<00:02:18.930> believe<00:02:19.020> it's<00:02:19.290> two<00:02:19.470> different

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.070 
anyone here I believe it's two different
microphones<00:02:20.010> so<00:02:20.580> you<00:02:21.240> always<00:02:21.450> have<00:02:21.600> one

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
microphones so you always have one

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.500 
microphones so you always have one
that's<00:02:23.010> not<00:02:23.250> covered<00:02:23.490> up<00:02:23.760> regardless<00:02:24.390> of<00:02:24.450> how

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
that's not covered up regardless of how

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.949 
that's not covered up regardless of how
you're<00:02:24.720> holding<00:02:24.870> it<00:02:25.170> and<00:02:26.090> at<00:02:27.090> the<00:02:27.300> bottom<00:02:27.480> here

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
you're holding it and at the bottom here

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:31.220 
you're holding it and at the bottom here
I<00:02:28.400> see<00:02:29.400> is<00:02:29.730> where<00:02:30.209> we<00:02:30.330> connect<00:02:30.690> the<00:02:30.780> charging

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
I see is where we connect the charging

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:34.100 
I see is where we connect the charging
cable<00:02:31.410> and<00:02:31.590> looks<00:02:31.830> like<00:02:32.040> maybe<00:02:32.250> an<00:02:32.750> audio<00:02:33.750> port

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110
