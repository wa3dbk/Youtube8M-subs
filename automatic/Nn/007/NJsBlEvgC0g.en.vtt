00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:18.970
 good morning you know what this is 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:22.510
 aspergillus niger the worst ruff in 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:26.529
 which you can beat it but from today there is the 

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:28.600
 new smooth professional we see the 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:31.050
 old the new super compared 

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:35.679
 in a field trial 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:38.999
 spray for 15 minutes 

00:00:35.679 --> 00:00:42.190
 wash with water and the mold is gone 

00:00:38.999 --> 00:00:43.539
 the new super professional demonstrates 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:47.519
 all its effectiveness 

00:00:43.539 --> 00:00:49.690
 you can see the difference and anti-mold 

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:52.510
 go up the mold thanks to repo 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:54.159
 clarified of money is in rough line 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:56.909
 their effectiveness depends on 

00:00:54.159 --> 00:01:01.709
 active chlorine concentration 

00:00:56.909 --> 00:01:01.709
 would come to say and michael active chlorine 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:07.090
 active chlorine suffers from the time factor 

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:09.130
 It is the space of a few months its power to 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:11.020
 attack and dissolve mold either 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:13.650
 effective part of the product 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:15.490
 collapses is a problem is a problem 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.620
 because as we know 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:21.000
 these products often remain at 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:21.000
 shelf for a long time 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:30.510
 first we stabilized the 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:33.300
 formulation of the new smooth so the 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:35.370
 active chlorine stabilized that not even the 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:37.560
 spend time and keep his 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:40.710
 ability to attack mold 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:43.170
 according to the dirty mold solve it 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.270
 the formulation of the new snow is not enough 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.420
 fair is enriched with tensoattivi anfo 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:52.590
 teri and anionics that hold more funds 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:55.320
 surfaces without ruining the third 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.570
 new smooth fair is more viscous 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.950
 you spray it and he adheres to the 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:02.340
 better to mold 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:05.759
 finally the new scam and perfumed to 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:07.350
 lemon but let's see what the tests say 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.940
 of laboratory 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.400
 we compared performance 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.739
 of the new snow fair with those of the 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.540
 old scooter and a product that 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:19.739
 declares a chlorine concentration 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:21.959
 active considerably higher 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:25.350
 mold of truth aspergillus schneiter 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:27.660
 the worst here is the results recorded 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:29.489
 from the three products after two months a 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.250
 warehouse 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:34.590
 the old super was effective in 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:37.290
 two tests out of four 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:41.280
 the other product has passed three tests on 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:45.769
 4 the new snow fair has surpassed all 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.769
 test with 100 percent effectiveness 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:53.520
 summarizing the new snow fair is more 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:56.350
 effective over time thanks to the formula 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:59.850
 stabilized associates with action 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:02.770
 anti-mold a deep cleansing action 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:06.100
 high viscosity for perfect adhesion 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:10.780
 of the liquid to the scented mold to the 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:14.530
 lemon available in three sizes 250
