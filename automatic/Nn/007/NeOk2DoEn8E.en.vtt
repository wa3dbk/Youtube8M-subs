00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
casino has been found and I'm going to

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.780 
casino has been found and I'm going to
discuss<00:01:03.960> it<00:01:04.170> in<00:01:04.350> this<00:01:04.589> video<00:01:04.949> so<00:01:05.610> I<00:01:05.640> believe

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
discuss it in this video so I believe

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.429 
discuss it in this video so I believe
this<00:01:06.060> Coney<00:01:06.299> was<00:01:06.479> actually<00:01:06.780> found<00:01:06.990> by<00:01:07.110> Bryce

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
this Coney was actually found by Bryce

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.859 
this Coney was actually found by Bryce
lazy<00:01:07.770> gamer<00:01:08.100> he<00:01:08.400> is<00:01:08.520> a<00:01:08.549> very<00:01:09.030> reliable<00:01:09.570> source

is<00:01:13.560> actually<00:01:13.770> leaked<00:01:14.159> things<00:01:14.460> in<00:01:14.610> the<00:01:14.700> past

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
is actually leaked things in the past

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.030 
is actually leaked things in the past
for<00:01:15.450> example<00:01:15.780> the<00:01:15.840> hips<00:01:16.020> the<00:01:16.140> DLC<00:01:16.590> under<00:01:16.920> the

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
for example the hips the DLC under the

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.469 
for example the hips the DLC under the
things<00:01:17.250> and<00:01:17.400> they<00:01:17.460> have<00:01:17.580> turned<00:01:17.850> out<00:01:18.119> to<00:01:18.330> be

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
things and they have turned out to be

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.890 
things and they have turned out to be
true<00:01:18.689> so<00:01:19.290> getting<00:01:19.590> into<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:20.610> coding<00:01:21.030> of<00:01:21.090> GTA<00:01:21.509> 5

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
true so getting into the coding of GTA 5

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.480 
true so getting into the coding of GTA 5
what<00:01:22.229> do<00:01:22.320> you<00:01:22.409> think<00:01:22.650> stuff<00:01:22.830> we<00:01:22.950> found<00:01:23.159> to<00:01:23.340> do

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
what do you think stuff we found to do

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.280 
what do you think stuff we found to do
with<00:01:23.670> the<00:01:23.790> casino<00:01:24.299> so<00:01:24.840> I'm<00:01:24.930> going<00:01:25.080> to<00:01:25.110> read<00:01:25.259> out

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
with the casino so I'm going to read out

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:26.719 
with the casino so I'm going to read out
the<00:01:25.500> codon<00:01:25.799> in<00:01:25.890> the<00:01:25.979> form<00:01:26.220> that<00:01:26.310> it's<00:01:26.549> then<00:01:26.700> it

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
the codon in the form that it's then it

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.310 
the codon in the form that it's then it
may<00:01:26.820> be<00:01:26.970> hard<00:01:27.240> to<00:01:27.330> understand<00:01:27.990> but<00:01:28.080> I'll<00:01:28.200> try

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
may be hard to understand but I'll try
