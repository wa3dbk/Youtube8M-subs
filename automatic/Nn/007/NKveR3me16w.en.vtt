00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.510 

the<00:00:37.000> rebel<00:00:37.300> flagship<00:00:37.900> was<00:00:38.890> my<00:00:39.100> white<00:00:39.340> whale

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:39.520 
the rebel flagship was my white whale

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:43.979 
the rebel flagship was my white whale
and<00:00:40.230> like<00:00:41.230> Captain<00:00:41.620> Ahab<00:00:41.710> I<00:00:42.570> was<00:00:43.570> willing<00:00:43.930> to

00:00:43.979 --> 00:00:43.989 
and like Captain Ahab I was willing to

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:48.150 
and like Captain Ahab I was willing to
do<00:00:44.170> anything<00:00:44.560> to<00:00:44.650> take<00:00:44.770> it<00:00:44.920> down<00:00:46.860> and<00:00:47.860> I<00:00:47.950> think

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:48.160 
do anything to take it down and I think

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.670 
do anything to take it down and I think
my<00:00:48.250> crew<00:00:48.430> knew<00:00:48.580> this<00:00:48.790> but<00:00:49.060> I<00:00:49.500> don't<00:00:50.500> think<00:00:50.620> they

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:50.680 
my crew knew this but I don't think they

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.400 
my crew knew this but I don't think they
fully<00:00:50.830> understood<00:00:51.309> it<00:00:51.460> so<00:00:52.170> before<00:00:53.170> we<00:00:53.290> engage

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:53.410
