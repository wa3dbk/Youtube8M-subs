whistles are that tsunami that's just

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:04.910 
whistles are that tsunami that's just
about<00:00:03.270> to<00:00:03.330> hit<00:00:03.510> the<00:00:03.570> coast<00:00:03.870> of<00:00:04.080> Japan<00:00:04.350> over

about to hit the coast of Japan over

remember<00:00:05.850> Japan<00:00:06.180> has<00:00:06.420> just<00:00:06.750> been<00:00:06.990> struck<00:00:07.440> by<00:00:07.620> a

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
remember Japan has just been struck by a

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:10.370 
remember Japan has just been struck by a
huge<00:00:08.280> earthquake<00:00:09.059> one<00:00:09.599> of<00:00:09.750> perhaps<00:00:10.080> the

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
huge earthquake one of perhaps the

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:11.810 
huge earthquake one of perhaps the
biggest<00:00:10.620> earthquakes<00:00:11.160> that<00:00:11.280> we've<00:00:11.460> seen<00:00:11.670> in

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
biggest earthquakes that we've seen in

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.620 
biggest earthquakes that we've seen in
10<00:00:12.000> years<00:00:12.030> over<00:00:12.420> there<00:00:12.540> 8.9<00:00:13.440> is<00:00:13.650> the<00:00:13.799> magnitude

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:14.630 
10 years over there 8.9 is the magnitude

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:17.090 
10 years over there 8.9 is the magnitude
earlier<00:00:15.630> on<00:00:15.780> there<00:00:15.990> was<00:00:16.170> a<00:00:16.199> tsunami<00:00:16.710> alert

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
earlier on there was a tsunami alert

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.010 
earlier on there was a tsunami alert
that<00:00:17.520> was<00:00:17.789> issued<00:00:18.000> but<00:00:18.420> now<00:00:18.570> that<00:00:18.779> tsunami

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
that was issued but now that tsunami

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.960 
that was issued but now that tsunami
finally<00:00:19.529> making<00:00:19.800> landfall<00:00:20.070> these<00:00:20.730> are

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
finally making landfall these are

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.390 
finally making landfall these are
perhaps<00:00:21.529> really<00:00:22.529> interesting<00:00:23.039> visuals

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
perhaps really interesting visuals

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.189 
perhaps really interesting visuals
because<00:00:23.760> this<00:00:24.150> is<00:00:24.300> perhaps<00:00:24.449> also<00:00:24.750> the<00:00:24.990> first

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
because this is perhaps also the first

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:26.810 
because this is perhaps also the first
time<00:00:25.410> that<00:00:25.590> we're<00:00:25.740> getting<00:00:26.039> to<00:00:26.189> see<00:00:26.369> something

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
time that we're getting to see something

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.220 
time that we're getting to see something
like<00:00:26.849> this<00:00:27.090> happened<00:00:27.510> live<00:00:27.689> on<00:00:27.720> Indian

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
like this happened live on Indian

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.109 
like this happened live on Indian
television<00:00:28.410> the<00:00:29.189> last<00:00:29.400> time<00:00:29.670> the<00:00:29.820> tsunami

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
television the last time the tsunami

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.089 
television the last time the tsunami
struck<00:00:30.480> over<00:00:30.720> here<00:00:30.869> in<00:00:31.019> Southeast<00:00:31.470> Asia<00:00:31.619> and

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
struck over here in Southeast Asia and

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.610 
struck over here in Southeast Asia and
we<00:00:32.160> saw<00:00:32.340> huge<00:00:32.640> damage<00:00:33.090> in<00:00:33.239> Sri<00:00:33.390> Lanka<00:00:33.719> and<00:00:33.870> also

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
we saw huge damage in Sri Lanka and also

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.650 
we saw huge damage in Sri Lanka and also
around<00:00:34.890> the<00:00:35.100> Indian<00:00:35.460> coast<00:00:35.790> we<00:00:36.180> never<00:00:36.360> really

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
around the Indian coast we never really

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.240 
around the Indian coast we never really
got<00:00:36.840> to<00:00:36.870> see<00:00:37.020> the<00:00:37.260> tsunami<00:00:37.590> but<00:00:37.710> over<00:00:38.010> here

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
got to see the tsunami but over here

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.790 
got to see the tsunami but over here
you're<00:00:38.700> seeing<00:00:39.030> huge<00:00:39.390> waves<00:00:39.690> move<00:00:40.410> towards

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
you're seeing huge waves move towards

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.639 
you're seeing huge waves move towards
the<00:00:41.010> coast<00:00:41.219> in<00:00:41.489> unprecedented<00:00:42.390> footage<00:00:43.200> but

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
the coast in unprecedented footage but

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.709 
the coast in unprecedented footage but
like<00:00:43.829> we<00:00:43.980> said<00:00:44.160> the<00:00:44.309> Japanese<00:00:44.579> earthquake<00:00:45.149> is

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
like we said the Japanese earthquake is

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.900 
like we said the Japanese earthquake is
occupying<00:00:46.379> center<00:00:46.920> stage<00:00:47.100> especially<00:00:47.670> for

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
occupying center stage especially for

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.479 
occupying center stage especially for
Asian<00:00:48.660> bosses<00:00:49.110> over<00:00:49.289> here<00:00:49.620> japan's<00:00:50.070> nikkei

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
Asian bosses over here japan's nikkei

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.540 
Asian bosses over here japan's nikkei
dropped<00:00:51.120> about<00:00:51.469> 1.7<00:00:52.469> percent<00:00:52.620> after<00:00:53.100> news

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
dropped about 1.7 percent after news

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.790 
dropped about 1.7 percent after news
broke<00:00:53.579> we<00:00:54.329> also<00:00:54.480> saw<00:00:54.750> a<00:00:54.780> huge<00:00:55.140> sell-off<00:00:55.410> in<00:00:55.739> the

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
broke we also saw a huge sell-off in the

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.380 
broke we also saw a huge sell-off in the
yen<00:00:56.219> that<00:00:56.430> dropped<00:00:56.730> to<00:00:56.879> its<00:00:56.910> lowest<00:00:57.120> level

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
yen that dropped to its lowest level

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.110 
yen that dropped to its lowest level
since<00:00:57.629> February<00:00:58.350> against<00:00:59.219> the<00:00:59.340> dollar<00:00:59.550> so

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
since February against the dollar so

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.880 
since February against the dollar so
there<00:01:00.420> you<00:01:00.570> have<00:01:00.600> those<00:01:00.989> pictures<00:01:01.199> coming<00:01:01.649> in

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
there you have those pictures coming in

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.020 
there you have those pictures coming in
so<00:01:02.789> far<00:01:03.260> most<00:01:04.260> offices<00:01:04.860> managed<00:01:05.309> to<00:01:05.489> evacuate

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
so far most offices managed to evacuate

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.100 
so far most offices managed to evacuate
in<00:01:06.150> time<00:01:06.180> but<00:01:06.840> our<00:01:06.990> reporters<00:01:07.770> from<00:01:09.110> Tokyo

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
in time but our reporters from Tokyo

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.810 
in time but our reporters from Tokyo
have<00:01:10.320> been<00:01:10.530> telling<00:01:10.830> us<00:01:10.950> that<00:01:11.010> offices<00:01:11.640> were

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
have been telling us that offices were

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.550 
have been telling us that offices were
evacuated<00:01:12.450> but<00:01:12.600> there's<00:01:12.780> been<00:01:12.960> one<00:01:13.170> building

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
evacuated but there's been one building

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.620 
evacuated but there's been one building
in<00:01:13.799> central<00:01:14.250> Tokyo<00:01:14.369> which<00:01:14.760> did<00:01:15.060> catch<00:01:15.299> fire

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
in central Tokyo which did catch fire

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.149 
in central Tokyo which did catch fire
we'll<00:01:16.170> get<00:01:16.290> you<00:01:16.409> more<00:01:16.439> details<00:01:16.890> or<00:01:17.009> perhaps

we'll get you more details or perhaps

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.280 
we'll get you more details or perhaps
some<00:01:17.580> damage<00:01:17.939> that's<00:01:18.180> been<00:01:18.360> reported<00:01:18.659> from

that particular place on the map the

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.330 
that particular place on the map the
epicenter<00:01:23.159> so<00:01:23.640> far<00:01:23.939> has<00:01:24.509> been<00:01:24.540> off<00:01:25.100> Tokyo<00:01:26.100> it's

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
epicenter so far has been off Tokyo it's

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:27.890 
epicenter so far has been off Tokyo it's
closer<00:01:26.700> over<00:01:27.060> there<00:01:27.210> to<00:01:27.420> a<00:01:27.450> city<00:01:27.720> called

closer over there to a city called
Nagoya

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
Nagoya

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.429 
Nagoya
we'll<00:01:29.159> tell<00:01:29.640> you<00:01:29.990> geographically<00:01:30.990> where<00:01:31.200> that

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
we'll tell you geographically where that

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.740 
we'll tell you geographically where that
fits<00:01:31.740> in<00:01:31.979> but<00:01:32.490> for<00:01:32.790> now<00:01:32.939> you<00:01:33.000> can<00:01:33.360> see<00:01:33.570> those

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
fits in but for now you can see those

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.210 
fits in but for now you can see those
huge<00:01:33.960> waves<00:01:34.350> earlier<00:01:34.740> on<00:01:34.860> there<00:01:34.979> were<00:01:35.070> also

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
huge waves earlier on there were also

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.770 
huge waves earlier on there were also
some<00:01:35.460> earlier<00:01:35.790> visuals<00:01:36.150> where<00:01:36.329> you<00:01:36.420> could<00:01:36.600> see

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
some earlier visuals where you could see

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.310 
some earlier visuals where you could see
the<00:01:37.229> waves<00:01:37.500> sweep<00:01:38.400> in<00:01:38.700> picking<00:01:39.450> up<00:01:39.570> everything

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
the waves sweep in picking up everything

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.499 
the waves sweep in picking up everything
that<00:01:40.530> lay<00:01:40.950> in<00:01:40.979> its<00:01:41.340> path<00:01:41.579> so<00:01:42.060> presumably

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
that lay in its path so presumably

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.330 
that lay in its path so presumably
there's<00:01:42.960> going<00:01:43.079> to<00:01:43.140> be<00:01:43.200> a<00:01:43.560> lot<00:01:43.770> of<00:01:43.890> damage

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
there's going to be a lot of damage

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.590 
there's going to be a lot of damage
there<00:01:44.810> was<00:01:45.810> also<00:01:46.200> reports<00:01:46.770> of<00:01:47.270> some<00:01:48.270> sort<00:01:48.540> of
