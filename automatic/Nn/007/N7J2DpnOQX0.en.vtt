the<00:00:09.809> next<00:00:10.110> type<00:00:10.290> of<00:00:10.559> technique<00:00:11.309> that<00:00:11.550> will<00:00:11.670> do

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
the next type of technique that will do

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.259 
the next type of technique that will do
is<00:00:12.179> a<00:00:12.240> technique<00:00:12.929> called<00:00:12.990> back<00:00:13.679> cutting<00:00:14.269> what

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
is a technique called back cutting what

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.050 
is a technique called back cutting what
we'll<00:00:15.420> do<00:00:15.570> here<00:00:15.599> is<00:00:15.960> actually<00:00:16.199> use<00:00:16.770> a

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:17.060 
we'll do here is actually use a

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:20.029 
we'll do here is actually use a
horizontal<00:00:18.060> piece<00:00:18.300> or<00:00:18.600> a<00:00:18.660> horizontal<00:00:19.590> section

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
horizontal piece or a horizontal section

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.640 
horizontal piece or a horizontal section
of<00:00:20.220> hair<00:00:21.410> this<00:00:22.410> particular<00:00:22.800> technique

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:24.650 
of hair this particular technique

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:27.769 
of hair this particular technique
actually<00:00:25.650> creates<00:00:26.460> a<00:00:26.699> lot<00:00:26.939> of<00:00:27.119> weight<00:00:27.359> in<00:00:27.599> the

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
actually creates a lot of weight in the

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.810 
actually creates a lot of weight in the
hair<00:00:28.019> and<00:00:28.260> a<00:00:28.380> lot<00:00:28.590> of<00:00:28.619> movement<00:00:29.220> as<00:00:29.400> far<00:00:29.670> as

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
hair and a lot of movement as far as

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.330 
hair and a lot of movement as far as
volume<00:00:30.330> is<00:00:30.510> concerned<00:00:30.960> for<00:00:31.800> those<00:00:31.920> clients

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
volume is concerned for those clients

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:33.650 
volume is concerned for those clients
that<00:00:32.369> are<00:00:32.489> looking<00:00:32.610> for<00:00:33.090> a<00:00:33.120> lot<00:00:33.300> of<00:00:33.450> volume

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
that are looking for a lot of volume

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.410 
that are looking for a lot of volume
this<00:00:34.260> is<00:00:34.469> a<00:00:34.500> great<00:00:34.800> technique<00:00:35.040> to<00:00:35.430> use<00:00:35.460> we'll

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
this is a great technique to use we'll

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.030 
this is a great technique to use we'll
take<00:00:36.600> our<00:00:36.660> section<00:00:37.230> that<00:00:37.380> will<00:00:37.500> be<00:00:37.649> about<00:00:37.890> an

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
take our section that will be about an

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.790 
take our section that will be about an
inch<00:00:38.129> and<00:00:38.430> a<00:00:38.550> half<00:00:38.579> section<00:00:39.590> again<00:00:40.590> it's

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
inch and a half section again it's

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.530 
inch and a half section again it's
horizontal<00:00:41.100> because<00:00:41.730> we<00:00:41.879> do<00:00:42.059> want<00:00:42.090> to<00:00:42.300> create

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
horizontal because we do want to create

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.619 
horizontal because we do want to create
some<00:00:42.840> weight<00:00:43.079> and<00:00:43.230> some<00:00:43.590> fullness<00:00:44.450> we'll<00:00:45.450> use

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
some weight and some fullness we'll use

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.350 
some weight and some fullness we'll use
our<00:00:45.780> sheer<00:00:46.170> but<00:00:46.920> typically<00:00:47.340> with<00:00:47.610> this<00:00:47.910> we

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
our sheer but typically with this we

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.420 
our sheer but typically with this we
don't<00:00:48.600> want<00:00:48.809> to<00:00:48.989> close<00:00:49.320> down<00:00:49.680> we're<00:00:50.190> still

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
don't want to close down we're still

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.880 
don't want to close down we're still
kind<00:00:50.670> of<00:00:50.820> talking<00:00:51.149> but<00:00:51.600> as<00:00:51.750> we<00:00:52.140> move<00:00:52.410> towards

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
kind of talking but as we move towards

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.240 
kind of talking but as we move towards
the<00:00:53.070> scout<00:00:53.399> we're<00:00:54.320> gradually<00:00:55.320> closing<00:00:55.800> the

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
the scout we're gradually closing the

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.610 
the scout we're gradually closing the
blade<00:00:56.579> of<00:00:56.879> the<00:00:56.940> shear<00:00:57.420> but<00:00:57.930> not<00:00:58.140> all<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.469> way

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
blade of the shear but not all the way

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.860 
blade of the shear but not all the way
to<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:59.039> scalp<00:00:59.309> and<00:00:59.489> not<00:00:59.879> all<00:01:00.120> the<00:01:00.329> way<00:01:00.359> closed

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
to the scalp and not all the way closed

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.740 
to the scalp and not all the way closed
I'll<00:01:01.260> do<00:01:01.770> this<00:01:01.920> in<00:01:02.160> slow<00:01:02.309> motion<00:01:02.670> so<00:01:03.480> that<00:01:03.510> you

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
I'll do this in slow motion so that you

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.620 
I'll do this in slow motion so that you
can<00:01:03.930> see<00:01:04.199> what<00:01:04.769> the<00:01:04.979> effect<00:01:05.280> would<00:01:05.460> be<00:01:05.610> it<00:01:06.420> will

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
can see what the effect would be it will

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.830 
can see what the effect would be it will
work<00:01:06.869> all<00:01:07.140> the<00:01:07.260> way<00:01:07.290> through<00:01:07.710> that<00:01:07.890> hair<00:01:08.100> shaft

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:08.840 
work all the way through that hair shaft

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:14.090 
work all the way through that hair shaft
notice<00:01:09.840> that<00:01:11.600> I'm<00:01:12.600> kind<00:01:13.020> of<00:01:13.170> talking<00:01:13.530> my<00:01:13.830> shear

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
notice that I'm kind of talking my shear

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.990 
notice that I'm kind of talking my shear
through<00:01:15.170> at<00:01:16.170> the<00:01:16.650> same<00:01:16.920> time<00:01:17.130> I'm<00:01:17.400> not<00:01:17.460> slide

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
through at the same time I'm not slide

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.410 
through at the same time I'm not slide
cutting<00:01:21.860> it's<00:01:22.860> almost<00:01:23.189> a<00:01:23.430> teasing<00:01:23.970> motion

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
cutting it's almost a teasing motion

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.929 
cutting it's almost a teasing motion
that<00:01:24.540> I<00:01:24.600> would<00:01:24.840> be<00:01:24.990> using<00:01:25.200> here<00:01:25.680> like<00:01:26.280> as<00:01:26.460> if<00:01:26.640> we

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
that I would be using here like as if we

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:35.700 
that I would be using here like as if we
were<00:01:27.119> teasing<00:01:27.509> the<00:01:27.780> hair<00:01:27.990> with<00:01:28.200> a<00:01:28.229> comb

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:35.710 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:38.219 

now<00:01:36.250> you'll<00:01:36.460> have<00:01:36.520> short<00:01:37.030> and<00:01:37.270> long<00:01:37.570> pieces<00:01:37.900> in

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:38.229 
now you'll have short and long pieces in

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:40.590 
now you'll have short and long pieces in
there<00:01:38.440> and<00:01:38.680> that's<00:01:39.159> okay<00:01:39.580> because<00:01:39.850> what<00:01:40.240> gives

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:40.600 
there and that's okay because what gives

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.690 
there and that's okay because what gives
what<00:01:40.930> that<00:01:41.170> will<00:01:41.320> give<00:01:41.500> us<00:01:41.530> is<00:01:41.830> a<00:01:42.159> lot<00:01:42.549> of

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:42.700 
what that will give us is a lot of

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.670 
what that will give us is a lot of
volume<00:01:42.940> and<00:01:43.330> a<00:01:43.420> lot<00:01:43.659> of<00:01:43.840> movement<00:01:44.260> underneath

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:44.680 
volume and a lot of movement underneath

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:46.560 
volume and a lot of movement underneath
almost<00:01:45.130> like<00:01:45.310> a<00:01:45.340> support<00:01:45.880> structure<00:01:46.240> in<00:01:46.510> the

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:46.570 
almost like a support structure in the

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:51.149 
almost like a support structure in the
hair<00:01:47.320> shaft<00:01:49.590> once<00:01:50.590> you've<00:01:50.740> had<00:01:50.920> some<00:01:51.130> practice

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:51.159 
hair shaft once you've had some practice

00:01:51.159 --> 00:02:00.120 
hair shaft once you've had some practice
at<00:01:51.729> this<00:01:57.540> you'll<00:01:58.540> move<00:01:58.750> at<00:01:59.020> a<00:01:59.200> faster<00:02:00.100> pace

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:00.130 
at this you'll move at a faster pace

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:01.950 
at this you'll move at a faster pace
because<00:02:00.759> you<00:02:01.060> want<00:02:01.270> to<00:02:01.390> work<00:02:01.570> through<00:02:01.840> the

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:01.960 
because you want to work through the

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:05.040 
because you want to work through the
hair<00:02:02.170> very<00:02:02.500> very<00:02:02.800> quickly<00:02:03.250> we<00:02:04.180> can<00:02:04.210> also<00:02:04.540> weave

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:05.050 
hair very very quickly we can also weave

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:12.240 
hair very very quickly we can also weave
out<00:02:05.350> here<00:02:05.860> with<00:02:06.700> the<00:02:06.729> bottom<00:02:07.210> blade<00:02:11.220> so<00:02:12.220> that

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
out here with the bottom blade so that

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:14.759 
out here with the bottom blade so that
we're<00:02:12.550> not<00:02:12.580> taking<00:02:13.150> all<00:02:13.300> of<00:02:13.360> that<00:02:13.630> hair<00:02:14.080> and

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:14.769 
we're not taking all of that hair and

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:20.130 
we're not taking all of that hair and
now<00:02:15.610> we'll<00:02:15.850> just<00:02:15.959> talk<00:02:16.959> the<00:02:17.170> hair<00:02:18.900> again<00:02:19.900> I'm

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
now we'll just talk the hair again I'm

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.259 
now we'll just talk the hair again I'm
not<00:02:20.200> pushing<00:02:20.680> the<00:02:20.980> blade<00:02:21.220> I'm<00:02:21.489> talking<00:02:22.120> the

00:02:22.259 --> 00:02:22.269 
not pushing the blade I'm talking the

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:24.540 
not pushing the blade I'm talking the
blade<00:02:22.510> through<00:02:22.900> so<00:02:23.590> I'm<00:02:23.680> not<00:02:23.830> creating<00:02:24.459> a

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:24.550 
blade through so I'm not creating a

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:27.150 
blade through so I'm not creating a
slide<00:02:24.850> cutting<00:02:25.300> type<00:02:25.510> of<00:02:25.690> effect<00:02:26.080> the<00:02:26.920> layers

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
slide cutting type of effect the layers

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.550 
slide cutting type of effect the layers
blend<00:02:27.580> in<00:02:27.790> very<00:02:27.820> nicely<00:02:28.360> and<00:02:28.780> that<00:02:29.170> gives<00:02:29.380> us

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
blend in very nicely and that gives us

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.800 
blend in very nicely and that gives us
more<00:02:29.769> support<00:02:30.280> underneath<00:02:30.640> so<00:02:31.330> that<00:02:31.360> we<00:02:31.630> can

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
more support underneath so that we can

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:34.050 
more support underneath so that we can
get<00:02:31.989> a<00:02:32.019> good<00:02:32.650> amount<00:02:32.769> of<00:02:33.010> volume<00:02:33.250> this

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
get a good amount of volume this

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.150 
get a good amount of volume this
technique<00:02:34.480> would<00:02:34.660> only<00:02:34.840> want<00:02:35.350> to<00:02:35.530> be<00:02:35.560> used<00:02:35.950> in

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 
technique would only want to be used in

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.130 
technique would only want to be used in
the<00:02:36.250> top<00:02:36.489> of<00:02:36.700> the<00:02:36.819> head<00:02:36.970> although<00:02:37.750> we<00:02:37.930> could

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
the top of the head although we could

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.620 
the top of the head although we could
use<00:02:38.350> it<00:02:38.380> around<00:02:38.680> the<00:02:39.069> middle<00:02:39.970> section<00:02:40.390> of<00:02:40.510> the

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:40.630 
use it around the middle section of the

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:43.830 
use it around the middle section of the
hair<00:02:40.810> to<00:02:41.440> give<00:02:41.620> us<00:02:41.799> more<00:02:42.390> movement<00:02:43.390> and<00:02:43.570> some

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
hair to give us more movement and some

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.799 
hair to give us more movement and some
more<00:02:43.989> volume<00:02:44.410> as<00:02:44.560> well
