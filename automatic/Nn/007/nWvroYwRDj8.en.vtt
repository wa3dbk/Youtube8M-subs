00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
demonstrate real quick how to use this

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:28.120 
demonstrate real quick how to use this
system<00:02:24.129> and<00:02:25.409> let's<00:02:26.409> go<00:02:26.590> ahead<00:02:26.769> and<00:02:26.859> do<00:02:26.950> that

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.130 
system and let's go ahead and do that

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:32.420 
system and let's go ahead and do that
okay<00:02:29.130> guys<00:02:29.280> here<00:02:29.580> is<00:02:29.670> extremely<00:02:30.360> compact<00:02:31.400> SCSS

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
okay guys here is extremely compact SCSS

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.610 
okay guys here is extremely compact SCSS
and<00:02:33.000> i'm<00:02:33.120> going<00:02:33.240> to<00:02:33.300> demonstrate<00:02:33.630> how<00:02:33.990> you<00:02:34.200> use

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
and i'm going to demonstrate how you use

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.950 
and i'm going to demonstrate how you use
the<00:02:34.970> highly-polished<00:02:35.970> signaling<00:02:36.720> mirror

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:36.960 
the highly-polished signaling mirror

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:40.820 
the highly-polished signaling mirror
here<00:02:37.550> you're<00:02:38.550> gonna<00:02:38.960> pull<00:02:39.960> slide<00:02:40.500> the<00:02:40.620> mirror

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
here you're gonna pull slide the mirror

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:44.600 
here you're gonna pull slide the mirror
out<00:02:41.450> you're<00:02:42.450> gonna<00:02:42.570> hold<00:02:42.840> it<00:02:43.020> in<00:02:43.110> your<00:02:43.800> hand

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
out you're gonna hold it in your hand

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:46.480 
out you're gonna hold it in your hand
just<00:02:44.730> like<00:02:44.850> this<00:02:45.150> then<00:02:45.780> you're<00:02:45.900> gonna<00:02:46.110> hold<00:02:46.260> a

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:46.490 
just like this then you're gonna hold a

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:49.630 
just like this then you're gonna hold a
v-formation<00:02:47.490> with<00:02:48.000> your<00:02:48.320> fingers<00:02:49.320> and<00:02:49.500> then

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
v-formation with your fingers and then

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.790 
v-formation with your fingers and then
you're<00:02:50.640> gonna<00:02:50.730> flash<00:02:51.240> that<00:02:51.690> light<00:02:52.020> just<00:02:52.500> like

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 
you're gonna flash that light just like

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:57.530 
you're gonna flash that light just like
that<00:02:53.160> using<00:02:53.700> your<00:02:53.990> fingers<00:02:54.990> as<00:02:55.230> the<00:02:56.540> aiming

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
that using your fingers as the aiming

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.750 
that using your fingers as the aiming
point<00:02:58.220> you<00:02:59.220> can<00:02:59.340> see<00:02:59.520> that<00:02:59.670> flash<00:02:59.970> right<00:03:00.330> there

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 
point you can see that flash right there

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:05.180 
point you can see that flash right there
but<00:03:02.760> it's<00:03:02.940> a<00:03:03.180> super<00:03:03.870> nice<00:03:04.050> system<00:03:04.500> very<00:03:04.770> small

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
but it's a super nice system very small

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:08.390 
but it's a super nice system very small
can<00:03:06.060> easily<00:03:06.420> keping<00:03:06.780> a<00:03:06.870> person<00:03:07.320> every<00:03:08.220> day

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
can easily keping a person every day

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:09.740 
can easily keping a person every day
like<00:03:08.610> I<00:03:08.730> said<00:03:08.970> it's<00:03:09.180> hard<00:03:09.360> to<00:03:09.450> carry<00:03:09.720> around

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
like I said it's hard to carry around

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.260 
like I said it's hard to carry around
signaling<00:03:10.410> gear<00:03:10.680> because<00:03:11.130> it's<00:03:11.460> just<00:03:11.700> ink<00:03:11.970> and

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:12.270 
signaling gear because it's just ink and

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:13.040 
signaling gear because it's just ink and
not<00:03:12.420> convenient

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.050 
not convenient

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:15.440 
not convenient
this<00:03:13.560> is<00:03:13.740> extremely<00:03:14.220> convenient<00:03:14.580> and<00:03:14.910> can<00:03:15.330> be

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
this is extremely convenient and can be

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:18.190 
this is extremely convenient and can be
carried<00:03:15.720> around<00:03:15.840> on<00:03:16.230> you<00:03:16.380> and<00:03:16.500> your<00:03:16.590> ADC<00:03:17.190> and

carried around on you and your ADC and

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:21.140
