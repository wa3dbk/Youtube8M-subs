doesn't seem to come through at all that
may<00:01:09.659> be<00:01:09.720> the<00:01:10.080> dye<00:01:10.520> not<00:01:11.520> coming<00:01:11.820> through<00:01:12.090> the

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
may be the dye not coming through the

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.899 
may be the dye not coming through the
armors<00:01:12.570> may<00:01:12.689> not<00:01:12.840> have<00:01:13.020> that<00:01:13.260> path<00:01:13.500> or<00:01:13.909> simply

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
armors may not have that path or simply

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.330 
armors may not have that path or simply
that's<00:01:15.659> the<00:01:15.990> control<00:01:16.320> for<00:01:16.710> the<00:01:16.740> glow<00:01:17.040> and

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
that's the control for the glow and

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.399 
that's the control for the glow and
these<00:01:18.000> only<00:01:18.210> occur<00:01:18.570> at<00:01:18.689> night<00:01:18.720> which<00:01:19.170> would<00:01:19.290> be

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
these only occur at night which would be

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.980 
these only occur at night which would be
really<00:01:19.710> annoying<00:01:19.950> for<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:20.490> preview<00:01:21.000> but<00:01:21.720> I'm

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
really annoying for the preview but I'm

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.560 
really annoying for the preview but I'm
not<00:01:22.500> entirely<00:01:22.860> sure<00:01:23.040> how<00:01:23.850> these<00:01:24.030> are<00:01:24.240> supposed

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
not entirely sure how these are supposed

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:25.730 
not entirely sure how these are supposed
to<00:01:24.659> be<00:01:24.750> working<00:01:25.229> whether<00:01:25.439> it's<00:01:25.650> a

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
to be working whether it's a

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.740 
to be working whether it's a
reinforcement<00:01:26.369> of<00:01:26.670> where<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:27.000> white<00:01:27.210> is<00:01:27.240> or

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
reinforcement of where the white is or

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.510 
reinforcement of where the white is or
whether<00:01:28.320> as<00:01:28.500> I<00:01:28.530> say<00:01:28.799> these<00:01:29.100> glow<00:01:29.340> at<00:01:29.490> night

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
whether as I say these glow at night

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.370 
whether as I say these glow at night
like<00:01:29.909> the<00:01:30.030> sylvari<00:01:30.450> would<00:01:30.720> which<00:01:31.079> would<00:01:31.110> make

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
like the sylvari would which would make

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.050 
like the sylvari would which would make
sense<00:01:31.619> but<00:01:31.950> would<00:01:32.100> still<00:01:32.310> be<00:01:32.430> really<00:01:32.850> annoying

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
sense but would still be really annoying

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.350 
sense but would still be really annoying
for<00:01:33.390> previewing<00:01:34.369> so<00:01:35.369> I<00:01:35.670> don't<00:01:36.030> actually<00:01:36.180> have

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
for previewing so I don't actually have

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.109 
for previewing so I don't actually have
any<00:01:36.750> previous<00:01:37.500> experience<00:01:37.680> or<00:01:38.400> any<00:01:38.700> great

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
any previous experience or any great

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.390 
any previous experience or any great
previous<00:01:39.750> experience<00:01:40.200> with<00:01:40.350> the<00:01:40.890> armor<00:01:41.189> sense

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
previous experience with the armor sense

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.550 
previous experience with the armor sense
though<00:01:42.329> I<00:01:42.750> have<00:01:43.020> seen<00:01:43.290> a<00:01:43.320> few

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
though I have seen a few

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.170 
though I have seen a few
before-and-after<00:01:44.340> pictures<00:01:44.700> and<00:01:44.880> I'll<00:01:45.030> be

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
before-and-after pictures and I'll be

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.940 
before-and-after pictures and I'll be
honest<00:01:45.450> the<00:01:46.020> difference<00:01:46.380> doesn't<00:01:46.740> really

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
honest the difference doesn't really

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.580 
honest the difference doesn't really
seem<00:01:47.250> that<00:01:47.280> great<00:01:47.700> but<00:01:48.420> I<00:01:48.720> don't<00:01:49.079> know<00:01:49.290> I<00:01:49.500> don't

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
seem that great but I don't know I don't

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.770 
seem that great but I don't know I don't
play<00:01:49.860> this<00:01:50.040> with<00:01:50.189> vari<00:01:50.369> so<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:51.060> armor<00:01:51.329> is<00:01:51.479> not

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
play this with vari so the armor is not

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.410 
play this with vari so the armor is not
that<00:01:52.020> big<00:01:52.200> of<00:01:52.229> a<00:01:52.350> concern<00:01:52.500> for<00:01:52.950> me<00:01:53.130> but<00:01:53.759> either

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
that big of a concern for me but either

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.209 
that big of a concern for me but either
way<00:01:54.720> I<00:01:54.750> thought<00:01:55.140> I'd<00:01:55.290> let<00:01:55.500> you<00:01:55.619> guys<00:01:55.799> know<00:01:56.070> in

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
way I thought I'd let you guys know in

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.490 
way I thought I'd let you guys know in
case<00:01:56.369> you<00:01:56.549> hadn't<00:01:57.030> heard<00:01:57.060> this<00:01:57.329> big<00:01:57.570> little

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
case you hadn't heard this big little

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.889 
case you hadn't heard this big little
little<00:01:58.950> smidgen<00:01:59.250> of<00:01:59.490> news<00:01:59.729> remember<00:02:00.479> then<00:02:00.750> it

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
little smidgen of news remember then it

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.539 
little smidgen of news remember then it
currently<00:02:01.200> only<00:02:01.259> affects<00:02:01.740> the<00:02:01.890> medium<00:02:02.189> tier<00:02:02.340> 2

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
currently only affects the medium tier 2

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:05.120 
currently only affects the medium tier 2
so<00:02:02.969> we'll<00:02:03.180> have<00:02:03.390> a<00:02:03.450> look<00:02:03.630> at<00:02:03.719> that<00:02:03.890> there's<00:02:04.890> no

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
so we'll have a look at that there's no

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.889 
so we'll have a look at that there's no
other<00:02:05.280> tier<00:02:05.579> ones<00:02:05.790> it's<00:02:06.030> just<00:02:06.090> light<00:02:06.570> Tier<00:02:06.840> one

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
other tier ones it's just light Tier one

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.930 
other tier ones it's just light Tier one
for<00:02:07.259> the<00:02:07.320> females<00:02:07.710> so<00:02:08.340> we'll<00:02:08.489> have<00:02:08.610> a<00:02:08.670> look<00:02:08.789> at

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
for the females so we'll have a look at

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.240 
for the females so we'll have a look at
the<00:02:09.030> tier<00:02:09.209> 2

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
the tier 2

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:16.070 
the tier 2
it<00:02:11.370> is<00:02:12.650> medium<00:02:13.650> tear<00:02:14.070> -<00:02:14.280> and<00:02:14.600> the<00:02:15.600> legs<00:02:15.780> will<00:02:15.960> be

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
it is medium tear - and the legs will be

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.880 
it is medium tear - and the legs will be
redressed

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
redressed

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.840 
redressed
so<00:02:17.640> medium<00:02:18.420> tear<00:02:18.690> -<00:02:19.250> and<00:02:20.250> apparently<00:02:20.490> these

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
so medium tear - and apparently these

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:27.380 
so medium tear - and apparently these
legs<00:02:24.740> something<00:02:25.740> wrong<00:02:25.920> with<00:02:26.100> the<00:02:26.220> legs<00:02:26.460> not

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
legs something wrong with the legs not

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.180 
legs something wrong with the legs not
entirely<00:02:27.660> sure<00:02:27.750> I<00:02:28.050> do<00:02:28.110> think<00:02:28.440> that<00:02:28.500> that<00:02:28.890> other

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
entirely sure I do think that that other

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.280 
entirely sure I do think that that other
dye<00:02:29.459> channel<00:02:30.120> is<00:02:30.240> going<00:02:30.450> to<00:02:30.540> be<00:02:30.600> the<00:02:30.810> glow<00:02:31.020> so

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
dye channel is going to be the glow so

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:32.600 
dye channel is going to be the glow so
these<00:02:31.380> had<00:02:31.530> ended<00:02:31.770> up<00:02:31.830> glowing<00:02:32.130> red<00:02:32.370> or

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
these had ended up glowing red or

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.420 
these had ended up glowing red or
something<00:02:32.970> as<00:02:33.750> I<00:02:33.780> say<00:02:34.020> I<00:02:34.200> can't<00:02:34.530> I<00:02:34.800> can't

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
something as I say I can't I can't

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.970 
something as I say I can't I can't
really<00:02:35.610> comment<00:02:35.940> but<00:02:36.440> just<00:02:37.440> for<00:02:37.560> you<00:02:37.620> guys<00:02:37.800> out

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
really comment but just for you guys out

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:39.860 
really comment but just for you guys out
there<00:02:38.010> who<00:02:38.340> do<00:02:38.490> play<00:02:38.640> a<00:02:38.730> safari<00:02:39.090> maybe<00:02:39.600> have

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
there who do play a safari maybe have

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.870 
there who do play a safari maybe have
the<00:02:40.020> armor<00:02:40.260> sets<00:02:40.440> maybe<00:02:41.040> avoided<00:02:41.580> the<00:02:41.670> armor

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
the armor sets maybe avoided the armor

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:43.640 
the armor sets maybe avoided the armor
sets<00:02:42.090> simply<00:02:42.480> because<00:02:42.780> they<00:02:43.080> didn't<00:02:43.440> have

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
sets simply because they didn't have

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:47.420 
sets simply because they didn't have
this<00:02:43.980> kind<00:02:44.250> of<00:02:44.370> glow<00:02:46.040> maybe<00:02:47.040> it's<00:02:47.190> time<00:02:47.280> to

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
this kind of glow maybe it's time to

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:48.320 
this kind of glow maybe it's time to
pick<00:02:47.520> them<00:02:47.700> up<00:02:47.760> although<00:02:48.000> interestingly

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
pick them up although interestingly

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.720 
pick them up although interestingly
enough<00:02:48.900> heavy<00:02:49.260> isn't<00:02:49.680> considered<00:02:50.190> anywhere

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
enough heavy isn't considered anywhere

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.880 
enough heavy isn't considered anywhere
which<00:02:51.420> is<00:02:51.570> a<00:02:51.600> little<00:02:51.870> bit<00:02:51.989> disappointing<00:02:52.140> but

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
which is a little bit disappointing but

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:58.190 
which is a little bit disappointing but
after<00:02:53.340> comparing<00:02:54.150> the<00:02:55.110> medium<00:02:55.560> tier<00:02:55.770> 3<00:02:57.200> which

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
after comparing the medium tier 3 which

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.530 
after comparing the medium tier 3 which
is<00:02:58.230> very<00:02:58.560> shiny<00:02:58.830> indeed<00:02:59.220> I'm<00:03:00.120> not<00:03:00.330> entirely

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
is very shiny indeed I'm not entirely

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.449 
is very shiny indeed I'm not entirely
sure<00:03:00.660> if<00:03:00.870> it<00:03:00.989> was<00:03:01.080> that<00:03:01.260> vibrant<00:03:01.860> before<00:03:02.340> the

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
sure if it was that vibrant before the

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:07.760 
sure if it was that vibrant before the
patch<00:03:02.640> with<00:03:03.450> the<00:03:03.780> heavy<00:03:04.739> tier<00:03:05.070> 3<00:03:05.370> and<00:03:06.770> the

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:07.770 
patch with the heavy tier 3 and the

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:10.910 
patch with the heavy tier 3 and the
shoulders<00:03:08.160> you<00:03:08.959> can<00:03:09.959> see<00:03:10.170> that<00:03:10.320> the<00:03:10.440> white<00:03:10.590> on

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
shoulders you can see that the white on

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:12.949 
shoulders you can see that the white on
the<00:03:11.160> medium<00:03:11.790> were<00:03:12.000> definitely<00:03:12.330> more<00:03:12.540> vibrant

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 
the medium were definitely more vibrant

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:15.080 
the medium were definitely more vibrant
so<00:03:13.260> maybe<00:03:13.709> that's<00:03:13.950> what<00:03:14.130> it<00:03:14.160> is<00:03:14.280> as<00:03:14.580> I<00:03:14.700> say<00:03:14.850> I'm

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
so maybe that's what it is as I say I'm
