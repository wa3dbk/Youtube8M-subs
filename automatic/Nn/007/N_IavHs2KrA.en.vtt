option raise your banner I'm going to

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.369 
option raise your banner I'm going to
demonstrate<00:00:45.030> how<00:00:45.539> that<00:00:45.750> works<00:00:45.960> because<00:00:46.110> it's

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
demonstrate how that works because it's

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.860 
demonstrate how that works because it's
kind<00:00:47.129> of<00:00:47.430> not<00:00:47.670> 100%<00:00:48.239> clear<00:00:48.329> right<00:00:48.600> at<00:00:48.629> first

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
kind of not 100% clear right at first

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.709 
kind of not 100% clear right at first
but<00:00:49.350> I'll<00:00:49.469> show<00:00:49.649> you<00:00:49.680> how<00:00:49.920> and<00:00:50.219> then<00:00:50.879> and<00:00:51.360> then

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
but I'll show you how and then and then

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.990 
but I'll show you how and then and then
we'll<00:00:51.870> use<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:53.129> Magyars<00:00:53.520> here<00:00:53.730> as<00:00:53.789> an<00:00:53.879> example

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
we'll use the Magyars here as an example

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.540 
we'll use the Magyars here as an example
of<00:00:54.360> how<00:00:54.480> useful<00:00:54.750> this<00:00:55.020> can<00:00:55.079> really<00:00:55.350> be<00:00:55.550> right

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
of how useful this can really be right

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.090 
of how useful this can really be right
so<00:00:56.820> first<00:00:57.149> let's<00:00:57.480> play<00:00:58.170> on<00:00:58.289> speed<00:00:58.559> five<00:00:58.800> and

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
so first let's play on speed five and

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.970 
so first let's play on speed five and
just<00:00:59.219> go<00:00:59.340> conquer<00:01:00.120> all<00:01:00.690> this<00:01:00.989> this<00:01:01.620> will<00:01:01.829> raise

those guys there there and there for

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.990 
those guys there there and there for
example<00:01:10.220> and<00:01:11.220> let's<00:01:11.430> just<00:01:11.549> let<00:01:12.240> it<00:01:12.360> go

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:14.000 
example and let's just let it go

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.710 
example and let's just let it go
actually<00:01:15.000> you<00:01:15.119> know<00:01:15.210> what<00:01:15.330> I<00:01:15.360> could<00:01:15.540> probably

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
actually you know what I could probably

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.350 
actually you know what I could probably
do<00:01:16.310> no<00:01:17.310> no<00:01:17.520> I've<00:01:17.670> got<00:01:17.880> to<00:01:17.909> do<00:01:18.030> it<00:01:18.090> this<00:01:18.210> way

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
do no no I've got to do it this way

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.030 
do no no I've got to do it this way
because<00:01:18.509> I<00:01:18.689> need<00:01:18.810> to<00:01:18.840> siege<00:01:19.110> the<00:01:19.259> land<00:01:19.500> to<00:01:19.890> win

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
because I need to siege the land to win

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.660 
because I need to siege the land to win
the<00:01:20.130> war<00:01:20.280> I<00:01:21.890> was<00:01:22.890> gonna<00:01:23.009> say<00:01:23.189> I<00:01:23.220> could<00:01:23.400> just<00:01:23.549> use

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
the war I was gonna say I could just use

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.359 
the war I was gonna say I could just use
the<00:01:23.820> imprison<00:01:24.270> feature<00:01:24.450> but<00:01:25.040> okay<00:01:26.040> so<00:01:26.100> he'll

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
the imprison feature but okay so he'll

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:48.940 
the imprison feature but okay so he'll
arrive<00:01:27.740> we'll<00:01:28.740> just<00:01:28.860> chase<00:01:29.009> them<00:01:29.159> down

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:48.950 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:53.090 

okay<00:01:49.970> so<00:01:50.970> basically<00:01:51.810> what<00:01:52.140> you<00:01:52.350> do<00:01:52.500> is<00:01:52.530> you<00:01:53.070> use

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
okay so basically what you do is you use

00:01:53.100 --> 00:02:00.080 
okay so basically what you do is you use
your<00:01:53.370> ruler<00:01:54.330> as<00:01:55.520> like<00:01:56.520> a<00:01:57.470> target<00:01:58.580> the<00:01:59.580> ruler<00:01:59.909> is

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
your ruler as like a target the ruler is

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.690 
your ruler as like a target the ruler is
used<00:02:00.119> to<00:02:00.810> flag<00:02:01.560> the<00:02:01.830> counties<00:02:02.220> you<00:02:02.400> wish<00:02:02.520> to

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
used to flag the counties you wish to

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.310 
used to flag the counties you wish to
keep<00:02:03.380> and<00:02:05.509> you<00:02:06.509> can<00:02:06.660> flag<00:02:06.869> as<00:02:06.990> many<00:02:07.140> as<00:02:07.229> you

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
keep and you can flag as many as you

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.440 
keep and you can flag as many as you
want<00:02:07.350> you<00:02:07.950> can<00:02:07.979> flag<00:02:08.280> just<00:02:08.490> one<00:02:08.820> you<00:02:09.090> can<00:02:09.209> flag

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
want you can flag just one you can flag

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.560 
want you can flag just one you can flag
your<00:02:09.690> core<00:02:09.959> provinces<00:02:10.679> for<00:02:10.830> example<00:02:11.310> or<00:02:11.850> you

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:12.570 
your core provinces for example or you

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:15.560 
your core provinces for example or you
can<00:02:12.720> flag<00:02:13.370> all<00:02:14.370> of<00:02:14.700> your<00:02:14.820> actual<00:02:15.180> land<00:02:15.390> and

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570 
can flag all of your actual land and

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:18.020 
can flag all of your actual land and

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:22.630 
it's generating a random courtier which

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:24.060 
it's generating a random courtier which
is<00:05:22.780> really<00:05:23.020> no<00:05:23.110> different<00:05:23.470> than<00:05:23.560> pressing<00:05:23.920> the

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:24.070 
is really no different than pressing the

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:26.700 
is really no different than pressing the
create<00:05:24.610> random<00:05:24.760> vessel<00:05:25.210> button<00:05:25.630> and<00:05:26.410> it<00:05:26.560> just

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:26.710 
create random vessel button and it just

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:29.310 
create random vessel button and it just
does<00:05:26.890> it<00:05:26.920> instantly<00:05:27.460> so<00:05:28.030> this<00:05:28.390> is<00:05:28.540> just

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:29.320 
does it instantly so this is just

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:31.070 
does it instantly so this is just
something<00:05:29.680> I<00:05:29.860> think<00:05:29.920> is<00:05:30.100> incredibly<00:05:30.670> useful

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:31.080 
something I think is incredibly useful

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:33.630 
something I think is incredibly useful
later<00:05:32.080> on<00:05:32.290> if<00:05:32.500> you<00:05:32.530> want<00:05:32.650> to<00:05:32.860> unflagged

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:33.640 
later on if you want to unflagged

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:36.000 
later on if you want to unflagged
counties<00:05:34.120> you<00:05:34.600> do<00:05:34.750> the<00:05:34.990> opposite<00:05:35.380> so<00:05:35.680> you<00:05:35.710> put

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:36.010 
counties you do the opposite so you put

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:38.450 
counties you do the opposite so you put
yourself<00:05:36.280> in<00:05:36.400> the<00:05:36.460> county<00:05:36.760> lower<00:05:37.450> your<00:05:37.690> banner

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:38.460 
yourself in the county lower your banner

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:41.060 
yourself in the county lower your banner
move<00:05:39.460> yourself<00:05:39.820> to<00:05:39.910> the<00:05:39.970> next<00:05:40.060> county<00:05:40.480> over

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:41.070 
move yourself to the next county over

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:44.460 
move yourself to the next county over
lower<00:05:42.070> your<00:05:42.280> banner<00:05:42.490> and<00:05:43.450> so<00:05:44.200> it's<00:05:44.290> like<00:05:44.410> a

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:44.470 
lower your banner and so it's like a

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:47.370 
lower your banner and so it's like a
binary<00:05:44.710> flagging<00:05:45.310> system<00:05:45.520> so<00:05:46.330> I<00:05:46.630> was<00:05:47.200> super

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:47.380 
binary flagging system so I was super

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:49.110 
binary flagging system so I was super
