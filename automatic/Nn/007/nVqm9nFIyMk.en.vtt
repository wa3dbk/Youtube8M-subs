00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:15.000
 hello to everyone then 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.590
 we often used to say that a 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:22.830
 high frequency detector is more 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:25.140
 powerful to detect targets 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.029
 difficult in polluted soils 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.760
 ferrous ie fine coins 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:32.990
 or very small currencies close to 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.520
 ferrous small so often 

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:36.500
 we discuss on the forums and it's true 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:38.860
 that we advise people in this type of 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:41.780
 difficult terrain on small targets 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:43.700
 to use another frequency so we're going 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:44.630
 see in this test if it's true or if 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.910
 it's an idea 

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:48.740
 so I'm going to do a simple test 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:50.930
 I used as moan and is a 

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:52.910
 currency of 1 euro cent for the 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:56.150
 good reason is that it's a currency 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:57.620
 actually in the interior is in iron or in 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:59.240
 nickel I know better but finally 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:02.480
 it's a ferrous and she's just 

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:05.270
 plated with a thin layer of copper 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:10.340
 so that's exactly what you want to try 

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:12.619
 to detect we will say a fine currency 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:14.270
 non ferrous in the middle of ferrous and 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:15.800
 so we'll do the bass test 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:17.990
 frequencies and in high frequency and one 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:19.970
 will see if the high frequency gives 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:22.040
 better results then in advance 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:23.510
 sorry for the sound of cicadas but 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.820
 since I am in the south east 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:27.250
 cons and years in the month of July I 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.990
 can not do otherwise 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.790
 so we will start the test in 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.590
 using the low frequency us 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:40.660
 so I'm going to show you all the 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:44.869
 settings so sensitivity to 90 frequency 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:46.940
 4 kg so the lowest frequency volume 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:52.490
 make it 0 for the sake of the test 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:54.440
 responsiveness 200 we will not change it a 10 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:57.679
 my crisis of 6 to eliminate 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:59.270
 little ferrous what I have you 

00:01:57.679 --> 00:02:01.600
 not shown sensitivity is good 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:07.130
 frequency 4 kg is the most important 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:10.240
 volume do 0 so that's gone on 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:10.240
 the 1 euro cent 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:21.290
 see this product absolutely none are 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:25.359
 finally spitting from time to time 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.359
 but nothing 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:36.700
 I can speed up the sweeps a little 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:36.700
 slow down see 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:44.469
 a spitting from time to time so 

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:45.750
 now we stay on the same 

00:02:44.469 --> 00:02:52.349
 settings 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:52.349
 except we go as you can imagine 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:02.400
 increase the frequency to 8 kg by six 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.400
 already it changes something 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:15.159
 then already hearths from 4 to 8 kg 

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:17.590
 we already have a lot more of her then 

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:19.989
 it's a are interspersed since there is 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:26.590
 ferrous som with and that we have the volume 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:28.900
 to 0 but in the other direction 1 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:33.450
 some are but it's not born yet 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:38.790
 achieved and now we will of course 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:44.829
 pass the highest frequency 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:46.810
 roy the result is there you see that it 

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:49.060
 ring 13 then there are small drips 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:50.109
 it's interspersed of course because it 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:52.120
 still had to do one in the 

00:03:50.109 --> 00:03:54.549
 bad but you see that the result 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:04:01.500
 is a lot better tomorrow tomorrow such 

00:03:54.549 --> 00:04:01.500
 is the scan speed reduce it 

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:05.729
 fernand the other meaning too 

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:13.590
 so here you see that the best 

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:17.079
 result 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:19.269
 we get it in frequency 18 kilos so 

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:21.370
 it's not a legend for the targets 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:23.199
 difficult in difficult terrain it's up to 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:26.259
 to say the small coins the fine 

00:04:23.199 --> 00:04:27.880
 currency in polluted soils of ferrous to 

00:04:26.259 --> 00:04:29.080
 high frequency will give good 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:31.090
 better results than bass 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:33.639
 frequency so again this is 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:34.479
 the utility of having a detector to 

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:36.699
 several frequencies 

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:38.080
 so here you can do the test by 

00:04:36.699 --> 00:04:38.770
 you even if you have a detector 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:40.810
 low frequencies 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:43.150
 you can do the test on the currency 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:45.099
 of 1 euro cent and you will see that 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:47.680
 it does not ring or very badly 

00:04:45.099 --> 00:04:50.700
 compared to high frequency go to 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:50.700
 soon for a new test
