00:00:17.769 --> 00:00:17.779 
arm hands you may get tingling on this

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:21.320 
arm hands you may get tingling on this
this<00:00:18.779> is<00:00:19.080> those<00:00:19.770> people<00:00:20.310> who<00:00:20.670> experience

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
this is those people who experience

this is those people who experience
pinched<00:00:21.810> pinched<00:00:22.410> nerves<00:00:22.710> may<00:00:22.980> be<00:00:23.039> from

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
pinched pinched nerves may be from

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.000 
pinched pinched nerves may be from
herniated<00:00:23.730> discs<00:00:24.090> but<00:00:24.720> the<00:00:25.289> great<00:00:25.740> thing

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
herniated discs but the great thing

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.439 
herniated discs but the great thing
about<00:00:26.099> this<00:00:26.340> exercise<00:00:26.910> is<00:00:27.180> that<00:00:27.210> we're

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
about this exercise is that we're

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.130 
about this exercise is that we're
targeting<00:00:27.750> a<00:00:28.289> specific<00:00:29.160> and<00:00:30.060> different<00:00:30.420> part

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
targeting a specific and different part

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.069 
targeting a specific and different part
of<00:00:31.439> the<00:00:31.890> pectoralis<00:00:32.630> that's<00:00:33.630> the<00:00:33.840> chest

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
of the pectoralis that's the chest

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.680 
of the pectoralis that's the chest
muscle<00:00:34.790> generally<00:00:35.790> you<00:00:35.910> have<00:00:35.940> to<00:00:36.210> understand

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
muscle generally you have to understand

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.619 
muscle generally you have to understand
that<00:00:37.079> the<00:00:37.410> PEC<00:00:37.770> muscles<00:00:38.219> attach<00:00:39.059> in<00:00:39.329> the<00:00:39.420> front

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
that the PEC muscles attach in the front

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:40.760 
that the PEC muscles attach in the front
of<00:00:39.719> the<00:00:39.780> shoulder<00:00:40.110> therefore<00:00:40.559> when<00:00:40.680> they

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
of the shoulder therefore when they

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.220 
of the shoulder therefore when they
contract<00:00:41.129> they<00:00:42.030> will<00:00:42.270> pronate<00:00:42.719> the<00:00:42.870> shoulders

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
contract they will pronate the shoulders

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.010 
contract they will pronate the shoulders
and<00:00:43.500> bring<00:00:43.649> it<00:00:43.770> forward<00:00:43.910> so<00:00:44.910> this<00:00:45.420> is<00:00:45.629> a<00:00:45.660> great

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
and bring it forward so this is a great

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.200 
and bring it forward so this is a great
exercise<00:00:46.350> to<00:00:47.039> take<00:00:47.340> the<00:00:47.489> slack<00:00:47.789> out<00:00:48.000> of<00:00:48.059> the

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
exercise to take the slack out of the

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.229 
exercise to take the slack out of the
muscle<00:00:48.570> to<00:00:49.320> reduce<00:00:49.890> the<00:00:50.250> contracture<00:00:51.030> and

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
muscle to reduce the contracture and

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.830 
muscle to reduce the contracture and
spasm<00:00:51.750> within<00:00:52.050> the<00:00:52.140> upper<00:00:52.410> trapezius<00:00:52.620> and

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:53.840 
spasm within the upper trapezius and

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.619 
spasm within the upper trapezius and
lower<00:00:54.840> neck<00:00:55.500> muscles<00:00:55.920> as<00:00:56.039> well<00:00:56.250> very<00:00:57.149> simple

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
lower neck muscles as well very simple

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.410 
lower neck muscles as well very simple
you're<00:00:58.260> going<00:00:58.440> to<00:00:58.500> grasp<00:00:58.829> your<00:00:59.730> two<00:01:00.090> hands

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
you're going to grasp your two hands

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.619 
you're going to grasp your two hands

chair<00:01:24.630> as<00:01:24.810> you<00:01:25.380> look<00:01:25.560> up<00:01:25.740> and<00:01:25.979> what<00:01:26.700> you're

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
chair as you look up and what you're

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.640 
chair as you look up and what you're
going<00:01:26.970> to<00:01:27.030> experience<00:01:27.390> your<00:01:27.840> experience<00:01:28.530> a

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
going to experience your experience a

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.300 
going to experience your experience a
stretch<00:01:29.130> in<00:01:29.549> the<00:01:30.329> lower<00:01:30.659> pectoralis<00:01:31.500> muscle

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
stretch in the lower pectoralis muscle

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:37.330 
stretch in the lower pectoralis muscle
that's<00:01:33.150> going<00:01:33.360> to<00:01:33.450> actually<00:01:33.780> elongate<00:01:36.110> okay

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.340 
that's going to actually elongate okay

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.830 
that's going to actually elongate okay
you<00:01:38.340> hold<00:01:38.460> that<00:01:38.579> stretch<00:01:38.880> about<00:01:39.180> 20-25

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
you hold that stretch about 20-25

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.810 
you hold that stretch about 20-25
seconds<00:01:40.619> and<00:01:40.770> that's<00:01:40.920> all<00:01:41.159> there<00:01:41.369> is<00:01:41.400> to<00:01:41.700> it

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
seconds and that's all there is to it

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.539 
seconds and that's all there is to it
but<00:01:42.810> understand<00:01:43.380> what<00:01:43.920> we're<00:01:44.100> trying<00:01:44.220> to<00:01:44.399> do

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
but understand what we're trying to do

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.249 
but understand what we're trying to do
is<00:01:44.670> we're<00:01:44.850> trying<00:01:45.030> to<00:01:45.119> elongate<00:01:45.780> and<00:01:45.960> open<00:01:46.200> up

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
is we're trying to elongate and open up

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:46.850 
is we're trying to elongate and open up
the<00:01:46.409> chest

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
the chest

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.330 
the chest
so<00:01:47.790> we<00:01:48.090> inhibit<00:01:48.630> the<00:01:49.290> excessive<00:01:49.799> pronation<00:01:50.009> of

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
so we inhibit the excessive pronation of

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.870 
so we inhibit the excessive pronation of
the<00:01:50.460> shoulders<00:01:50.850> which<00:01:51.600> inhibits<00:01:52.200> and<00:01:52.880> takes

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
the shoulders which inhibits and takes

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.819 
the shoulders which inhibits and takes
away<00:01:54.030> the<00:01:54.329> inflammatory<00:01:54.630> changes<00:01:55.439> occurring

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
away the inflammatory changes occurring

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.620 
away the inflammatory changes occurring
on<00:01:55.920> that<00:01:56.040> nerve<00:01:56.280> and<00:01:56.520> the<00:01:56.939> contraction<00:01:57.329> of<00:01:57.540> the

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
on that nerve and the contraction of the

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.050 
on that nerve and the contraction of the
muscles<00:01:58.159> hopefully<00:01:59.159> that<00:01:59.369> will<00:01:59.460> help<00:01:59.610> you<00:01:59.850> and

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
muscles hopefully that will help you and

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.319 
muscles hopefully that will help you and
again<00:02:00.899> do<00:02:01.500> those<00:02:01.740> stretches<00:02:02.700> every<00:02:02.969> day<00:02:03.119> you

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
again do those stretches every day you

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:04.670 
again do those stretches every day you
could<00:02:03.450> do<00:02:03.570> them<00:02:03.659> several<00:02:04.110> times<00:02:04.140> a<00:02:04.469> day

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
could do them several times a day

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.280 
could do them several times a day
great<00:02:05.340> stretch<00:02:05.729> different<00:02:06.450> angle<00:02:06.750> to<00:02:06.780> PEC<00:02:07.049> and

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
great stretch different angle to PEC and
