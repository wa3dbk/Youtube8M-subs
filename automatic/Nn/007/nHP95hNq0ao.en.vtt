00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.720
 full when the horn principle with 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:08.340
 compressor revisited for to make 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.880
 something much more powerful 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:15.780
 and which roughly corresponds to the horns 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:18.180
 we have on some trains 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:21.510
 the basic principle is a compressor 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:24.359
 an air reserve and a circuit that 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.390
 to determine when and how 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:29.070
 under which conditions it is necessary 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:31.710
 operate the compressor to recharge 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.800
 the air cylinder so we'll see a 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.059
 little bit the constituent elements 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.590
 for now the trumpets are not 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.809
 connected it's just for for 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.899
 illustration if I can say the 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.489
 compressor so a 12 volt compressor 

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:46.440
 simple on which I added a 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.920
 fan because that it tends to 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:52.230
 heat the compressor a lot it 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.860
 so send the air here in the 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.140
 bottle that's the outlet valve that 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.900
 will go to the banks 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:02.610
 we'll see later but this woman will be 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:04.770
 Serene asks Ben the distance 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:06.840
 mastered the orders so we have a 

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:09.750
 manometer in all simplicity and here we have a 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:13.530
 ready this stage which anyway couple 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:16.050
 the compressor torque at 8 bars so 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.210
 then here we have our food that 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:22.050
 happens we have a fuse of 40 in pairs 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.640
 at the kazoo and circuit level so this 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:26.220
 to see who is interesting 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.880
 so we have this is the receiver of 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:32.130
 the hearing internment does not have the relay 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:33.810
 which activates the zombie valve and here we 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.510
 has a timer ie five minutes 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:39.479
 customizable time that allows us to 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:41.070
 determine young and off phases for 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.479
 the compressor for not that they heat 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.610
 permanently because these compressors 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.030
 there are not made to turn a name 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.800
 man 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.479
 so it's for example we want to tell him 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:51.150
 to run for 20 seconds and of 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:53.670
 to do 40 seconds break is all to 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:55.619
 is possible what and there we have the beautiful 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:59.729
 role and that allows just talent 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:01.350
 and disable the compressor so the 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.180
 bottle the choice of the air bottle 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:07.130
 it's an old gas cylinder that has 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:10.380
 been happy finally vivid and secure and 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:12.720
 filled with air finally he pretended to be 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:14.370
 filled with air 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.660
 the interest is that the pressures are 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.980
 very high in gas cylinders 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.420
 so we do not have two years does not have any 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.510
 worry so we're going to work at 8 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:25.380
 bars knowing that that's all we can 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:29.040
 has a horn that will work 10 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:30.000
 12 bars without any worries what it takes 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.840
 see it's clear bottles and winnings 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:36.120
 relatively small 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:37.800
 so every press on the horn does 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.650
 precisely lowers the pressure enough 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:42.270
 quickly within the carboy so 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.590
 obviously with all this system right there 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:47.300
 that the pressure drops in the bottle 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:48.500
 the compressor begins to fill 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:52.050
 instantly 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:53.180
 so knows it pretty much pretty much the 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:56.100
 general principle 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:57.480
 so we will highlight it in 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:01.400
 functioning i'm going to branches and 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:06.380
 trunks and and we'll do a little test 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:06.380
 as long as we climb to his bar here is 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:12.050
 how one simply 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:20.019
 I was going back up we are 

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:23.530
 pretty much so bar here it keeps 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:25.629
 well these phases on and off as expected I 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:28.440
 went with a power supply on 

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:30.819
 battery because pc power supply 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:34.260
 was not enough to make 

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:37.780
 run the compressor here I go 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:41.500
 continue to plug tubal for 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:43.020
 the moment genius so the end cable of the 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:45.180
 pipe of 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:46.820
 eleven bar that we support bar 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:50.510
 so it's pretty rigid 

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:52.650
 it's also pretty boring at m but 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:54.660
 nevertheless, there are no worries 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:59.010
 So here I have more than the magazine 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:04:03.230
 actually the kind of concentrators with 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:03.230
 the outlet the outlet of the valve 

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:13.530
 so that's it is I connected 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:15.560
 I connected the outlet valve the 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:19.500
 cliff the outlet of the electro valves 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:23.610
 with the concentrator so we did well 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:28.470
 our 4 our 4 uncle who are connected 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:30.030
 so here we are at about six bars 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:32.580
 and a half between them siba and a half and this 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:38.640
 bar so we 'll wait we wait 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:42.590
 to get to 8 bars here we are at little 

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:48.510
 near goes up to something like 7 8 beats 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:53.270
 so we will test then seeing a whole 

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:53.270
 little bit remote control remote 

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:06.800
 so a compressor is really a 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:06.800
 little bit on the road in reichel 

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:30.680
 when then I disconnected the tubes 

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:31.880
 to empty the void and the 

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:36.770
 bottle so we'll see a little bit 

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:40.100
 the air outlet without getting bored at the end 

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:42.440
 so live there we are so marble where I 

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:44.240
 go video until we are 

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:45.890
 until the bottle is fast 

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:47.890
 you'll see it's okay 

00:05:45.890 --> 00:06:02.300
 relatively relatively quickly 

00:05:47.890 --> 00:06:05.050
 this part so much tell you that 

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:07.280
 in terms of duration of use 

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:10.780
 it's a little bit it's a little bit 

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:13.690
 limit but hey it does not prevent to use 

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:15.920
 or a larger tank 

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:18.550
 so do not hesitate if you have 

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:18.550
 questions 

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:25.840
 so I said if you have any 

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:27.460
 questions if you want to know 

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:31.150
 how do you go see in the 

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:34.390
 description there is an article that 

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:35.800
 explain a little bit how 

00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:40.200
 mount all that and you find the 

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:40.200
 components here's the next
