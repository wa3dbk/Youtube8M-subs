00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
millimeters the distal popliteal artery

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:18.020 
millimeters the distal popliteal artery
was<00:03:14.640> about<00:03:15.050> 7.1<00:03:16.050> millimeters<00:03:16.680> and<00:03:16.860> the<00:03:17.640> tibial

perineal trunk was about five point five

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:23.420 
perineal trunk was about five point five
millimeters<00:03:21.090> we<00:03:22.020> also<00:03:22.230> used<00:03:22.590> the<00:03:22.710> ultrasound

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
millimeters we also used the ultrasound

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:26.060 
millimeters we also used the ultrasound
to<00:03:23.790> measure<00:03:24.030> the<00:03:24.270> artery<00:03:24.750> above<00:03:25.290> the<00:03:25.440> aneurysm

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:26.070 
to measure the artery above the aneurysm

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:28.610 
to measure the artery above the aneurysm
which<00:03:26.400> was<00:03:26.610> eight<00:03:26.790> point<00:03:27.090> one<00:03:27.180> by<00:03:27.750> seven<00:03:28.320> point

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
which was eight point one by seven point

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:31.700 
which was eight point one by seven point
eight<00:03:28.770> millimeters<00:03:29.840> so<00:03:30.840> this<00:03:31.080> is<00:03:31.260> the<00:03:31.410> view<00:03:31.680> of

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:31.710 
eight millimeters so this is the view of

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:34.460 
eight millimeters so this is the view of
the<00:03:32.010> intravascular<00:03:32.430> ultrasound<00:03:33.290> we're<00:03:34.290> going

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 
the intravascular ultrasound we're going

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:36.860 
the intravascular ultrasound we're going
to<00:03:34.560> start<00:03:34.980> in<00:03:35.250> the<00:03:35.490> distal<00:03:36.270> superficial

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
to start in the distal superficial

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:39.380 
to start in the distal superficial
femoral<00:03:37.050> artery<00:03:37.560> go<00:03:38.400> initially<00:03:38.700> into<00:03:39.300> the

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:39.390 
femoral artery go initially into the

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:41.990 
femoral artery go initially into the
aneurysm<00:03:39.750> and<00:03:40.290> into<00:03:40.680> the<00:03:40.800> stenosis<00:03:41.220> just

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
aneurysm and into the stenosis just

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.870 
aneurysm and into the stenosis just
above<00:03:42.630> the<00:03:42.840> joint<00:03:43.140> line<00:03:43.320> pull<00:03:44.190> back<00:03:44.400> into<00:03:44.760> the

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:44.880 
above the joint line pull back into the

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:47.090 
above the joint line pull back into the
aneurysm<00:03:45.209> and<00:03:45.660> then<00:03:45.930> go<00:03:46.140> down<00:03:46.320> to<00:03:46.590> the<00:03:46.709> distal

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:47.100 
aneurysm and then go down to the distal

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:50.060 
aneurysm and then go down to the distal
perineal<00:03:47.550> trunk<00:03:47.970> so<00:03:48.870> when<00:03:49.080> we<00:03:49.260> start<00:03:49.590> this<00:03:49.830> now

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:50.070 
perineal trunk so when we start this now

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:53.090 
perineal trunk so when we start this now
you'll<00:03:50.430> see<00:03:50.760> that<00:03:51.480> the<00:03:51.690> artery<00:03:52.110> is<00:03:52.290> fairly

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:53.100 
you'll see that the artery is fairly

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:56.360 
you'll see that the artery is fairly
round<00:03:53.370> that<00:03:54.150> there<00:03:54.450> is<00:03:54.600> no<00:03:54.870> serious<00:03:55.440> plaque<00:03:56.040> in

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
round that there is no serious plaque in

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:58.640 
round that there is no serious plaque in
the<00:03:56.520> artery<00:03:56.910> and<00:03:57.090> there's<00:03:57.750> no<00:03:57.930> thrombus

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
the artery and there's no thrombus

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:01.850 
the artery and there's no thrombus
lining<00:03:59.250> the<00:03:59.430> wall<00:03:59.670> of<00:04:00.000> the<00:04:00.120> artery<00:04:00.420> as<00:04:00.690> we<00:04:01.650> get

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:01.860 
lining the wall of the artery as we get

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:05.150 
lining the wall of the artery as we get
down<00:04:02.130> towards<00:04:02.850> the<00:04:03.360> aneurysm<00:04:04.350> there<00:04:04.980> once

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:05.160 
down towards the aneurysm there once

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:07.580 
down towards the aneurysm there once
again<00:04:05.489> isn't<00:04:06.000> very<00:04:06.239> much<00:04:06.480> thrombus<00:04:07.200> in<00:04:07.380> this

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:07.590 
again isn't very much thrombus in this

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:11.150 
again isn't very much thrombus in this
artery<00:04:08.010> and<00:04:08.510> we're<00:04:09.510> lucky<00:04:09.750> with<00:04:10.110> that<00:04:10.160> the

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:11.160 
artery and we're lucky with that the

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:14.600 
artery and we're lucky with that the
artery<00:04:11.520> gets<00:04:11.640> big<00:04:12.600> quite<00:04:13.110> rapidly<00:04:13.709> and<00:04:14.100> here

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:14.610 
artery gets big quite rapidly and here

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:15.290 
artery gets big quite rapidly and here
it<00:04:14.700> comes

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:15.300 
it comes

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:17.330 
it comes
you<00:04:15.750> get<00:04:15.930> a<00:04:15.959> sense<00:04:16.380> that<00:04:16.620> the<00:04:16.770> popliteal

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:17.340 
you get a sense that the popliteal

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:20.870 
you get a sense that the popliteal
artery<00:04:17.730> is<00:04:18.030> quite<00:04:18.419> large<00:04:18.750> it<00:04:19.140> has<00:04:20.040> some<00:04:20.489> plaque

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880 
artery is quite large it has some plaque

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:28.980 
artery is quite large it has some plaque
in<00:04:21.209> it<00:04:21.359> but<00:04:22.049> is<00:04:22.169> not<00:04:22.200> lined<00:04:22.800> by<00:04:23.100> any<00:04:23.310> thrombus

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:28.990 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:32.140 

this<00:04:29.990> is<00:04:30.169> more<00:04:30.469> secular<00:04:31.219> aneurysm<00:04:31.909> than<00:04:32.060> a

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:32.150 
this is more secular aneurysm than a

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:34.899 
this is more secular aneurysm than a
fusiform<00:04:32.590> aneurysm<00:04:33.590> which<00:04:34.189> is<00:04:34.340> unusual<00:04:34.879> for

00:04:34.899 --> 00:04:34.909 
fusiform aneurysm which is unusual for

00:04:34.909 --> 00:04:38.350 
fusiform aneurysm which is unusual for
the<00:04:35.150> popliteal<00:04:35.629> artery<00:04:36.819> will<00:04:37.819> be<00:04:37.939> going<00:04:38.150> more

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:38.360 
the popliteal artery will be going more

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:41.080 
the popliteal artery will be going more
distal<00:04:39.169> here<00:04:39.409> in<00:04:39.590> a<00:04:39.680> second<00:04:40.129> through<00:04:40.550> the<00:04:40.699> area

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:41.090 
distal here in a second through the area

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:43.420 
distal here in a second through the area
of<00:04:41.270> stenosis<00:04:41.740> but<00:04:42.740> right<00:04:42.949> now<00:04:43.129> we're

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:43.430 
of stenosis but right now we're

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:45.339 
of stenosis but right now we're
re-entering<00:04:44.060> the<00:04:44.150> aneurysm<00:04:44.779> to<00:04:44.930> get<00:04:45.080> another

00:04:45.339 --> 00:04:45.349 
re-entering the aneurysm to get another

00:04:45.349 --> 00:04:47.649 
re-entering the aneurysm to get another
look<00:04:45.650> to<00:04:45.919> see<00:04:46.099> if<00:04:46.189> we've<00:04:46.400> missed<00:04:46.789> some<00:04:47.090> traumas

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:52.269 
that we have a good size match and seal
proximally<00:05:49.639> and<00:05:49.669> distally<00:05:50.710> the<00:05:51.710> stent<00:05:52.039> is

00:05:52.269 --> 00:05:52.279 
proximally and distally the stent is

00:05:52.279 --> 00:05:56.290 
proximally and distally the stent is
then<00:05:52.339> deployed<00:05:53.089> and<00:05:54.370> you<00:05:55.370> can<00:05:55.550> see<00:05:55.819> the<00:05:56.000> stent

00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:56.300 
then deployed and you can see the stent

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:59.350 
then deployed and you can see the stent
vaguely<00:05:56.689> here<00:05:57.370> it's<00:05:58.370> deployed<00:05:58.819> through<00:05:59.210> the

aneurysm down below the joint line we

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:06.219 
aneurysm down below the joint line we
then<00:06:03.289> went<00:06:03.529> about<00:06:04.000> angioplasty<00:06:05.000> the<00:06:05.300> stent<00:06:05.599> so

00:06:06.219 --> 00:06:06.229 
then went about angioplasty the stent so

00:06:06.229 --> 00:06:08.110 
then went about angioplasty the stent so
that<00:06:06.409> it<00:06:06.529> was<00:06:06.649> firmly<00:06:06.979> opposed<00:06:07.520> to<00:06:07.819> the<00:06:07.909> wall

in<00:06:09.110> addition<00:06:09.649> we<00:06:09.800> needed<00:06:10.099> to<00:06:10.250> dilate<00:06:10.789> that

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:11.060 
in addition we needed to dilate that

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:13.240 
in addition we needed to dilate that
stenosis<00:06:11.509> that<00:06:12.259> was<00:06:12.439> at<00:06:12.589> the<00:06:12.710> level<00:06:12.860> of<00:06:13.129> the

today<00:07:02.850> we<00:07:03.120> saw<00:07:03.330> the<00:07:03.360> advantages<00:07:04.110> of<00:07:04.170> utilizing

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:04.440 
today we saw the advantages of utilizing

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:07.790 
today we saw the advantages of utilizing
intravascular<00:07:05.340> ultrasound<00:07:06.290> not<00:07:07.290> only<00:07:07.590> did<00:07:07.770> it

00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:07.800 
intravascular ultrasound not only did it

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:10.790 
intravascular ultrasound not only did it
save<00:07:08.190> contrast<00:07:08.970> material<00:07:09.800> preoperatively

00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:10.800 
save contrast material preoperatively

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:13.550 
save contrast material preoperatively
and<00:07:11.100> intraoperatively<00:07:12.090> it's<00:07:12.900> saved<00:07:13.200> having

00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:13.560 
and intraoperatively it's saved having

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:15.950 
and intraoperatively it's saved having
to<00:07:13.650> do<00:07:13.800> a<00:07:13.830> CT<00:07:14.160> scan<00:07:14.730> of<00:07:14.760> a<00:07:15.030> known<00:07:15.270> palpable

00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:15.960 
to do a CT scan of a known palpable

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:18.680 
to do a CT scan of a known palpable
aneurysm<00:07:16.680> we<00:07:17.430> were<00:07:17.520> able<00:07:17.640> to<00:07:17.820> appropriately

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:18.690 
aneurysm we were able to appropriately

00:07:18.690 --> 00:07:21.080 
aneurysm we were able to appropriately
sized<00:07:19.020> the<00:07:19.410> aneurysm<00:07:20.100> we<00:07:20.640> were<00:07:20.730> able<00:07:20.850> to

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:21.090 
sized the aneurysm we were able to

00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:22.940 
sized the aneurysm we were able to
appropriately<00:07:21.660> place<00:07:21.960> the<00:07:22.200> right<00:07:22.440> graft

00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:22.950 
appropriately place the right graft

00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:25.460 
appropriately place the right graft
inside<00:07:23.340> of<00:07:23.850> it<00:07:24.110> intravascular<00:07:25.110> ultrasound

00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:25.470 
inside of it intravascular ultrasound

00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:28.490 
inside of it intravascular ultrasound
was<00:07:26.100> used<00:07:26.310> percutaneously<00:07:27.300> in<00:07:27.630> this<00:07:27.900> case<00:07:28.140> it

00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:28.500 
was used percutaneously in this case it

00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:30.530 
was used percutaneously in this case it
can<00:07:28.680> be<00:07:28.740> used<00:07:29.010> operatively<00:07:29.610> for<00:07:29.970> sizing<00:07:30.390> these

00:07:30.530 --> 00:07:30.540 
can be used operatively for sizing these

00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:32.510 
can be used operatively for sizing these
aneurysms<00:07:30.900> and<00:07:31.380> it<00:07:31.950> certainly<00:07:32.310> is<00:07:32.490> a

00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:32.520 
aneurysms and it certainly is a

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:35.030 
aneurysms and it certainly is a
significant<00:07:33.270> advantage<00:07:33.330> to<00:07:33.900> the<00:07:33.990> patient<00:07:34.380> not

00:07:35.030 --> 00:07:35.040 
significant advantage to the patient not

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:38.150 
significant advantage to the patient not
to<00:07:35.280> have<00:07:35.490> to<00:07:35.640> undergo<00:07:35.910> additional<00:07:37.160> invasive

00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:38.160 
to have to undergo additional invasive

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:42.080
