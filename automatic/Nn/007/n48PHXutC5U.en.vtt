I've had really like bad experiences

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.220 
I've had really like bad experiences
with<00:01:18.160> the<00:01:18.430> light<00:01:18.820> colored<00:01:19.150> dyes<00:01:19.300> before<00:01:19.780> and

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:20.230 
with the light colored dyes before and

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:23.220 
with the light colored dyes before and
you<00:01:21.010> know<00:01:21.130> the<00:01:21.340> color<00:01:21.550> not<00:01:21.700> taken<00:01:22.090> properly<00:01:22.360> so

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:23.230 
you know the color not taken properly so

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:25.560 
you know the color not taken properly so
I'm<00:01:23.590> hoping<00:01:24.040> that<00:01:24.250> this<00:01:24.370> is<00:01:24.640> light<00:01:24.910> enough<00:01:24.940> to

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:25.570 
I'm hoping that this is light enough to

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:29.370 
I'm hoping that this is light enough to
get<00:01:26.080> some<00:01:26.470> good<00:01:26.620> color<00:01:26.680> out<00:01:27.160> of<00:01:27.190> it<00:01:27.520> and<00:01:28.350> see<00:01:29.350> I

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:29.380 
get some good color out of it and see I

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:31.410 
get some good color out of it and see I
think<00:01:29.440> that's<00:01:29.680> crossed<00:01:29.980> and<00:01:30.280> I<00:01:31.150> will<00:01:31.270> probably

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:31.420 
think that's crossed and I will probably

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:34.680 
think that's crossed and I will probably
be<00:01:31.690> back<00:01:31.900> afterwards<00:01:32.650> if<00:01:33.400> it<00:01:33.610> looks<00:01:33.790> good<00:01:33.970> to

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:34.690 
be back afterwards if it looks good to

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:39.890 
be back afterwards if it looks good to
talk<00:01:35.020> about<00:01:35.260> it<00:01:36.780> yeah<00:01:37.780> so<00:01:38.560> fingers<00:01:39.430> crossed

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
talk about it yeah so fingers crossed

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.020

in the future there's a really nice like
raspberry<00:03:14.980> color<00:03:15.310> I<00:03:15.579> think<00:03:15.760> it<00:03:15.879> is<00:03:16.030> if<00:03:16.359> you

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
raspberry color I think it is if you

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:18.000 
raspberry color I think it is if you
have<00:03:16.540> dark<00:03:16.810> hair<00:03:16.930> I<00:03:17.260> reckon<00:03:17.590> the<00:03:17.709> darker

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
have dark hair I reckon the darker

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:19.890 
have dark hair I reckon the darker
colors<00:03:18.280> like<00:03:18.489> there's<00:03:18.669> a<00:03:18.730> really<00:03:19.359> nice<00:03:19.480> blue

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
colors like there's a really nice blue

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.420 
colors like there's a really nice blue
and<00:03:20.260> there<00:03:20.379> was<00:03:20.470> the<00:03:20.560> other<00:03:20.680> raspberry<00:03:21.040> purple

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.430 
and there was the other raspberry purple

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:23.039 
and there was the other raspberry purple
and<00:03:21.549> the<00:03:21.639> red<00:03:21.669> if<00:03:22.239> you've<00:03:22.419> got<00:03:22.569> dark<00:03:22.750> hair<00:03:22.900> I

00:03:23.039 --> 00:03:23.049 
and the red if you've got dark hair I

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:24.180 
and the red if you've got dark hair I
think<00:03:23.319> if<00:03:23.440> you<00:03:23.530> put<00:03:23.650> it<00:03:23.769> on<00:03:23.829> it<00:03:23.949> would<00:03:24.010> give<00:03:24.159> a

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:24.190 
think if you put it on it would give a

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:25.800 
think if you put it on it would give a
really<00:03:24.489> nice<00:03:24.609> tin<00:03:24.970> like<00:03:25.299> I<00:03:25.389> can't<00:03:25.569> guarantee

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
really nice tin like I can't guarantee

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:28.319 
really nice tin like I can't guarantee
that<00:03:26.139> but<00:03:26.979> I<00:03:27.310> reckon<00:03:27.849> they<00:03:28.030> would<00:03:28.150> give<00:03:28.299> a

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:28.329 
that but I reckon they would give a

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:30.420 
that but I reckon they would give a
really<00:03:28.629> really<00:03:28.930> nice<00:03:29.049> tint<00:03:29.440> so<00:03:29.829> yeah<00:03:29.979> the<00:03:30.129> next

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:30.430
