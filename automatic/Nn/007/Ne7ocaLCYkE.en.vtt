tradition of these live Christmas

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:21.740 
tradition of these live Christmas
specials<00:01:19.920> it's<00:01:20.040> not<00:01:20.130> been<00:01:20.280> done<00:01:20.430> since<00:01:20.610> 1957<00:01:21.510> I

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
specials it's not been done since 1957 I

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.800 
specials it's not been done since 1957 I
think<00:01:21.960> you're<00:01:22.050> 59<00:01:23.270> so<00:01:24.270> what<00:01:24.450> we're<00:01:24.570> trying<00:01:24.720> to

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
think you're 59 so what we're trying to

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.950 
think you're 59 so what we're trying to
do<00:01:24.990> is<00:01:25.170> pretty<00:01:26.040> audacious<00:01:26.220> and<00:01:26.940> in<00:01:27.210> a<00:01:27.540> walk<00:01:27.690> in

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
do is pretty audacious and in a walk in

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.200 
do is pretty audacious and in a walk in
a<00:01:28.110> time<00:01:28.860> when<00:01:29.160> people<00:01:29.400> don't<00:01:29.850> expect<00:01:30.090> this

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
a time when people don't expect this

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.270 
a time when people don't expect this
kind<00:01:30.390> of<00:01:30.479> thing<00:01:30.660> so<00:01:30.840> I<00:01:31.680> think<00:01:31.800> it<00:01:32.040> could<00:01:32.130> be<00:01:32.250> a

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
kind of thing so I think it could be a

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.170 
kind of thing so I think it could be a
lot<00:01:32.430> of<00:01:32.460> fun

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.750 

do<00:01:36.360> a<00:01:36.390> show<00:01:36.690> you<00:01:37.020> usually<00:01:37.200> get<00:01:37.530> a<00:01:37.800> number<00:01:38.640> of

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:38.760 
do a show you usually get a number of

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:43.280 
do a show you usually get a number of
performances<00:01:39.420> too<00:01:40.700> to<00:01:41.700> hone<00:01:41.940> it<00:01:42.170> you<00:01:43.170> know

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
performances too to hone it you know

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:44.480 
performances too to hone it you know
whether<00:01:43.470> if<00:01:43.650> you're<00:01:43.800> on<00:01:44.010> the<00:01:44.100> road<00:01:44.280> before

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
whether if you're on the road before

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.820 
whether if you're on the road before
coming<00:01:44.850> into<00:01:44.970> Broadway<00:01:45.240> you'll<00:01:45.780> play<00:01:46.650> and

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:46.830

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
play and play and play and play until

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.940 
play and play and play and play until
you've<00:01:48.240> kind<00:01:48.510> of<00:01:48.600> created<00:01:49.110> the<00:01:49.290> best<00:01:49.470> version

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
you've kind of created the best version

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.820 
you've kind of created the best version
of<00:01:50.040> what<00:01:50.190> you<00:01:50.280> think<00:01:50.490> that<00:01:50.700> performance<00:01:51.570> is<00:01:51.830> we

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:52.830 
of what you think that performance is we

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:56.560 
of what you think that performance is we
get<00:01:53.010> one<00:01:53.220> go<00:01:53.430> we<00:01:54.360> get<00:01:54.479> one<00:01:54.750> time<00:01:55.050> to<00:01:55.260> do<00:01:55.410> it<00:01:55.560> and

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:56.570 
get one go we get one time to do it and

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:00.640 
get one go we get one time to do it and
and<00:01:57.570> that's<00:01:57.780> that's<00:01:58.640> going<00:01:59.640> to<00:01:59.700> be<00:01:59.790> quite

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:00.650 
and that's that's going to be quite

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:04.840 
and that's that's going to be quite
scary

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:04.850 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:06.999 

I<00:02:04.970> always<00:02:05.450> used<00:02:05.689> to<00:02:05.750> sit<00:02:06.049> and<00:02:06.140> lay<00:02:06.710> down<00:02:06.740> in
