 we cut the leek along the 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:02.250
 under the francesca pot with 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:06.479
 inside this butter please a thread 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:08.100
 of butter you have and oil and we do 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:12.030
 a sauce without making you discover too much 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:15.530
 the pores meanwhile I go to cut the 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.530
 small diced potatoes 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:24.830
 then when the leek is stewed without 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:31.250
 but having made them take on color together 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:32.960
 the potatoes are dried and browned 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:33.530
 also flavor the potatoes inside and 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:37.750
 out 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:37.750
 let's put some salt pepper 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:46.070
 once you are well aware of flavors 3 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:48.549
 call vegetable broth or water 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:50.690
 I leave the choice to you and put the 

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:54.280
 broth until you get to cover 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:54.280
 plenty of potatoes 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:07.800
 and let's start our cooking 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.590
 they will have to become everything beautiful 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:11.820
 tender and then blend it and get it 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.570
 precisely what is called 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:18.150
 precisely cream cream of potatoes in this 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:21.540
 case now the potato cream of course 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:24.590
 well cooked, we pour it into a jug e 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.590
 we are going to whisk them 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:36.500
 it goes from measuring how much I have against it 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:40.760
 when 600 grams then I put his 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:43.220
 album and in proportion the parmesan 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:47.080
 grated and whisk the cream of 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:47.080
 potatoes with egg white parmesan 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:56.940
 at this point we must anoint good 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:59.220
 molds and fill the molds with the 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:00.810
 our cream of potatoes and leeks up to 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:03.000
 edge to fill with all the molds 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:06.000
 we put cold water into a bath 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.970
 maria and also with this in the oven at 130 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.860
 140 degrees and then wait in the 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:13.280
 our cooking then having to do one 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:15.600
 I do something tartare for everyone 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:17.280
 tartare means that I leave the fish 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:20.250
 raw not the sea ​​nor salmon 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:22.560
 just throw away a part of me 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:25.340
 I need this because this is enough 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:28.110
 we will make each strawberry next to you in the 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:32.040
 thinly slicing salmon and then a 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:35.850
 tartare so it is written just man of 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:38.820
 thar thar we collect the result of 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:41.580
 this tartare in a boule and I put it there 

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:45.770
 in a bit of salt and pepper put 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:45.770
 of the oil and chives 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:57.690
 mix the tartare ok now I prepare 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:04:02.430
 this sort of creamy sauce made with one 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:05.450
 semi-whipped yogurt and salt cream 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:08.040
 pepper chives and lemon juice 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:10.370
 inside the yogurt I go to put the juice 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.370
 of lemon 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:19.079
 pour this yogurt into the cream 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:21.030
 semimontata we also put here a 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:22.980
 goccino of oil this a very sauce 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:25.290
 fresh that marries well with the bride fish 

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:29.730
 well with boiled potatoes a goccino of 

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:31.800
 pepper is a bit of salt and here also there 

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:33.060
 then put some chives then 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:36.090
 on the plate before alpha also goes ha 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:39.060
 always disconnected from cold in this way 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:40.590
 passing the knife all around then 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:42.900
 do this move so you can enter 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:45.080
 some air eventually and he comes 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:45.080
 Street 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:52.110
 then once it was well separated 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:54.540
 I do have another one here that I have 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:56.280
 unplugged before also I pass it so in a 

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:58.110
 wanting saucer covered with some 

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:59.820
 film and put it to heat a 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:03.229
 microwave so that the microwave 

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:06.030
 I'm not going to ruin it and he can 

00:05:03.229 --> 00:05:08.310
 regenerate at this point I take mine 

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:11.039
 flan and I'm going to put it in the plate of 

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:13.289

00:05:11.039 --> 00:05:15.960
 made with the salmon tartare you make 

00:05:13.289 --> 00:05:18.060
 this rotatory movement of the 

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:19.330
 tsp 

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:21.750
 so 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:21.750
