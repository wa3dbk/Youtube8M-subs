subject tell us that you know makes

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:55.410 
subject tell us that you know makes
sense<00:02:53.739> so<00:02:54.010> we<00:02:54.489> combine<00:02:54.849> the<00:02:55.000> two<00:02:55.150> and<00:02:55.180> that's

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
sense so we combine the two and that's

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:56.699 
sense so we combine the two and that's
why<00:02:55.540> there's<00:02:55.750> an<00:02:55.840> economic<00:02:56.019> system<00:02:56.380> in
