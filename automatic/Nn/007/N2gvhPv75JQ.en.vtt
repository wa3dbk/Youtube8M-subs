00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:12.130
 and it is the world that the new 

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:13.240
 find on destiny for a whole 

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:15.490
 new video was seeing us right now 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:17.110
 that very active on destiny so we get 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:19.000
 found with monty tempe simply 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:20.920
 for location two measurements so 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.689
 you simply leave it the 

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:24.279
 spawn and you'll take the same path 

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:27.189
 that as if you were going to the forefront 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:29.259
 so it's a live commentary so we're going 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:30.970
 discover at the same time what is on offer 

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:33.040
 swear so I went to see looking for 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:34.239
 but I have not opened yet 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.559
 I have some information and I know little 

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:39.100
 how is it going to be normally? 

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:41.530
 So here we open and the house 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:43.780
 so here we have the gloves dlc 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:44.739
 for the titans so let's see all this 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:46.329
 which is pretty much what it looks like 

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:49.629
 yeah so really very very classy 

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:51.039
 gloves of this new dlc that we could 

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:52.989
 see in and trailer and others that are 

00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:55.420
 really stylish so personally me 

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:56.559
 I have the headphones so I'm not going 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:57.249
 excuse me I'll wait for the 

00:00:56.559 --> 00:00:58.719
 next week to be able to 

00:00:57.249 --> 00:01:00.129
 improve it I think it will come the 

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:03.429
 next week you will explain everything 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:05.199
 that after so that's so for others 

00:01:03.429 --> 00:01:05.560
 classes you can have things from 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:07.720
 based 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:10.120
 by cons they will have I believe the 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:12.159
 new maximum defense if I do not 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:14.710
 not deceive to complete it until 439 for a 

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:16.180
 plastron and here she is where with 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:17.530
 the new maximization so 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:19.329
 now with 36 of light as one 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:21.399
 can see instead of 30 

00:01:19.329 --> 00:01:24.040
 as usual so it's really 

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:26.770
 ultra helpful it's even totally 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:30.299
 therefore useless I rather take a 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:33.369
 headphones with hoping of course to have 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:35.170
 a name a helmet for my class I 

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:37.090
 hope because rubbish ongs ram 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:38.110
 is the only man I did I did 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.240
 not had anything for my class so 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:41.200
 it's a shame so after how 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.700
 it's going to be at the level of these 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.590
 improvements will not explain to you 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.780
 already normally there you see 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:49.780
 currently that it puts me as what 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:52.149
 come I can not sweat improved 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:54.340
 rise and red death while everything 

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:56.560
 I just have these weapons there so we 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:58.180
 just sees there just already a little 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.890
 detail it simply needs it 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:01.450
 to maximize or not necessarily I believe 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.979
 simply that they are from the 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:05.320
 first box you see your blade or 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:06.549
 red for example she is in 1 on 1 and 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.759
 if I take it off and I go through 

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:10.630
 Exegesis Normally that's it 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:12.520
 locke areas so it's very important 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:13.480
 already forward in principal you see 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.340
 that the weapons that we can improve this 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.800
 week are there master of thunder 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:20.110
 icebreaker thistle last words 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.940
 red death the reign of on bone and has 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:23.470
 hurry alike for that 2 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:26.350
 you just have to wear item a 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:27.640
 sent that if I switch owen or there I 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:28.240
 can not switch his only 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.830
 cons 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:32.830
 where are you me I think if I 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:35.230
 would put that it would be the same so that's it 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:37.660
 so I'm going to buy this too 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:39.160
 it's a challenge we have with everything 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:40.870
 simply and therefore risk this new 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:44.410
 character you will surely make a video 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:45.460
 for this challenge where I will see so here is 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:47.200
 so we will keep a little class 

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:49.480
 strange for bursts at the end of 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.160
 week let's see often what has 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.440
 maybe I'll buy maybe the 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.700
 gloves I do not know yet manage and I 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:58.780
 do not propose that we immediately 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:03:00.640
 or open our g exotic everything 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:01.840
 just years hope to have some 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:03.880
 thing for our class really that's me 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.500
 would do a lot of rage and not 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:13.800
 to have something for my class that's me 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:16.750
 drunk would not be bad no 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:18.250
 it's always done at it's always the 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:21.190
 problem see something that depends 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:23.260
 for its class of evil in the name gipa 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:25.270
 aims to do it is a whole framework that 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:27.459
 happens to me all the time I've never had the 

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:29.470
 turn this game to tell you the required them 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:31.270
 I had this first raid amount but 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:34.540
 I did so much raid before without 

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:36.280
 to have stuff besides a whore so 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:37.900
 that's okay yeah that's a shame I would have 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.790
 well liked to have something for my 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:41.260
 class but as usual it will be 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:41.709
 always second to g I would have 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:45.760
 want to say 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:47.860
 and of course we never have the parts 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:53.650
 that it must be here, of course, there 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:56.110
 missing 4 4 and 4 5 6 7 missing 7 for 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:57.700
 to have a new year g it's pretty bad 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:00.010
 I come in at the end of the week if I 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:01.290
 do not take any weapons or gloves that 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:02.950
 it remains to be seen 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:04.269
 knowing that I like to play at 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:06.070
 headphones so I prefer limits at on to 

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:08.830
 his next good ben it's done a 

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:09.880
 shine that's already so so here is 

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:11.200
 I still hope that this video you 

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:12.910
 will have pleased the passage so see you 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:15.489
 can see everything you have on 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:16.989
 measure in passing my personal for those 

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:17.470
 that it interests the ch in the process of raising 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:20.200
 the 30 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:21.220
 geltzeiler or stiff but not done 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:22.240
 disassembled simply because I 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:23.620
 account maybe make me a second 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:25.590
 little time so when you see it 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:27.000
 just miss the headphones so 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:30.300
 I will see to buy it at the forefront or 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.790
 other name press we do not care but weapons 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:34.889
 I'm trying now I have not done 

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:36.090
 you are not afraid legendary so that's 

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:37.320
 for that it's a shame I would have liked 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:39.330
 it breaks ice then only more 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:41.639
 just improve it it's a little shit 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:44.160
 and so that's so if not yesterday orange and 

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:46.350
 loot the episode was I deleted 

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:47.790
 he saw some Canadian and August gels the 

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:49.590
 red death and exegesis so I 

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:50.580
 really lucky and on bleach or 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:54.900
 of this weapon there for the death 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:56.550
 So that's that's about all it is 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:05:00.030
 pity because there result i'm going 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:01.770
 not see a stuff for my light was 

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:03.510
 sad I will try to train the 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:05.130
 light particles with a little bit of 

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:06.330
 luck if I find a way and 

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:07.710
 may be able to quickly 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:09.030
 so here it was so a little video 

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:10.500
 very short I hope she will have you 

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:12.450
 more this bad to the next for of 

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:15.290
 the video was 2009 and on either 

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:15.290
 everybody
