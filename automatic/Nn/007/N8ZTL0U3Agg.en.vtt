hello again um friend was saying how
could<00:00:14.250> I<00:00:14.400> improve<00:00:15.179> on<00:00:15.540> the<00:00:15.690> dais<00:00:16.460> well<00:00:18.529> here's

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
could I improve on the dais well here's

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:25.310 
could I improve on the dais well here's
a<00:00:19.710> standard<00:00:20.580> death<00:00:22.279> nine<00:00:23.279> inch<00:00:23.490> coil<00:00:24.320> very

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
a standard death nine inch coil very

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.200 
a standard death nine inch coil very
efficient<00:00:26.869> control<00:00:27.869> box<00:00:28.500> and<00:00:29.220> the<00:00:29.970> wireless

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
efficient control box and the wireless

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.600 
efficient control box and the wireless
headphones<00:00:32.570> but<00:00:33.739> can't<00:00:34.739> really<00:00:35.070> improve<00:00:35.219> on

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
headphones but can't really improve on

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.350 
headphones but can't really improve on
that<00:00:35.640> it's<00:00:36.239> a<00:00:36.420> brilliant<00:00:36.660> machine<00:00:37.190> but<00:00:38.360> you

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
that it's a brilliant machine but you

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.760 
that it's a brilliant machine but you
could<00:00:39.570> always<00:00:39.750> get<00:00:40.760> one<00:00:41.760> of<00:00:41.879> these<00:00:42.559> which<00:00:43.559> is<00:00:43.739> a

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
could always get one of these which is a

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.020 
could always get one of these which is a
large<00:00:44.040> coil<00:00:45.110> so<00:00:46.110> um<00:00:46.640> they're<00:00:47.640> they're<00:00:47.850> easily

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
large coil so um they're they're easily

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.779 
large coil so um they're they're easily
switched<00:00:48.480> over<00:00:48.840> it<00:00:49.050> takes<00:00:49.320> you<00:00:49.559> 12<00:00:49.890> a<00:00:50.520> minute

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
switched over it takes you 12 a minute

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.840 
switched over it takes you 12 a minute
to<00:00:50.969> switch<00:00:51.210> these<00:00:51.420> coils<00:00:51.719> and<00:00:52.670> you're<00:00:53.670> going

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
to switch these coils and you're going

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.819 
to switch these coils and you're going
from<00:00:54.030> that<00:00:54.180> one<00:00:54.329> to<00:00:54.600> that<00:00:54.629> one<00:00:54.780> so<00:00:55.230> in<00:00:55.710> effect

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
from that one to that one so in effect

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.520 
from that one to that one so in effect
you've<00:00:56.219> got<00:00:56.370> two<00:00:56.579> detectors<00:00:57.180> but<00:00:58.170> I<00:00:58.230> thought

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
you've got two detectors but I thought

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.189 
you've got two detectors but I thought
well<00:00:58.739> of<00:00:59.070> you<00:00:59.670> yeah<00:00:59.879> what<00:01:00.539> can<00:01:00.719> I<00:01:00.780> do<00:01:00.989> to

mother and there you go I've now got a

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.160 
mother and there you go I've now got a
detector<00:01:24.810> that<00:01:24.840> someone<00:01:25.320> else<00:01:25.439> can<00:01:25.710> use<00:01:26.009> port

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.170 
detector that someone else can use port

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:30.590 
detector that someone else can use port
um<00:01:28.549> what<00:01:29.549> we<00:01:29.670> may<00:01:29.850> see<00:01:29.909> we're<00:01:30.270> missing<00:01:30.509> a

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
um what we may see we're missing a

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.069 
um what we may see we're missing a
control<00:01:31.079> box<00:01:31.290> and<00:01:31.590> headphones<00:01:31.770> ah<00:01:33.049> but<00:01:34.049> I

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
control box and headphones ah but I

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.700 
control box and headphones ah but I
thought<00:01:34.320> Harvard<00:01:34.860> a<00:01:34.950> lateral<00:01:35.340> thinking<00:01:36.530> so<00:01:37.530> I

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
thought Harvard a lateral thinking so I

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.990 
thought Harvard a lateral thinking so I
got<00:01:37.920> another<00:01:38.159> pair<00:01:38.460> of<00:01:38.490> headphones<00:01:39.740> again

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 
got another pair of headphones again

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.760 
got another pair of headphones again
given<00:01:42.000> to<00:01:42.180> MIT<00:01:42.420> to<00:01:42.450> see<00:01:43.259> if<00:01:43.380> we<00:01:43.530> can<00:01:43.680> improve

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
given to MIT to see if we can improve

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.090 
given to MIT to see if we can improve
this<00:01:44.159> death<00:01:44.630> and<00:01:45.630> I've<00:01:46.380> got<00:01:46.409> some<00:01:46.560> brilliant

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
this death and I've got some brilliant

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.910 
this death and I've got some brilliant
friends<00:01:49.100> and<00:01:50.100> this<00:01:50.430> little<00:01:50.640> control<00:01:51.180> box<00:01:51.450> on

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 
friends and this little control box on

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.749 
friends and this little control box on
the<00:01:52.939> headphones<00:01:54.530> you<00:01:55.530> can<00:01:55.560> use<00:01:55.950> that<00:01:56.130> manually

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
the headphones you can use that manually

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:00.499 
the headphones you can use that manually
to<00:01:56.969> tune<00:01:57.360> these<00:01:58.200> headphones<00:01:58.530> into<00:01:59.219> just<00:01:59.909> dark

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
to tune these headphones into just dark

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:04.069 
to tune these headphones into just dark
oil<00:02:01.549> so<00:02:02.549> these<00:02:02.790> headphones<00:02:03.090> over<00:02:03.689> here<00:02:03.899> are

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
oil so these headphones over here are

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:06.230 
oil so these headphones over here are
listening<00:02:04.439> to<00:02:04.710> this<00:02:04.890> one<00:02:05.189> and<00:02:05.219> they<00:02:05.850> can<00:02:06.030> tune

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
listening to this one and they can tune

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.940 
listening to this one and they can tune
in<00:02:06.390> to<00:02:06.540> this<00:02:06.659> if<00:02:06.869> you<00:02:06.899> want<00:02:07.170> to<00:02:07.229> use<00:02:07.350> this<00:02:07.590> with

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
in to this if you want to use this with

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:13.220 
in to this if you want to use this with
that<00:02:09.349> but<00:02:10.349> I<00:02:10.819> tune<00:02:11.819> these<00:02:12.090> on

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
that but I tune these on

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:18.110 
that but I tune these on
channel<00:02:14.599> 32<00:02:15.599> just<00:02:15.810> that<00:02:16.019> coil<00:02:16.260> and<00:02:16.970> did<00:02:17.970> it

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
channel 32 just that coil and did it

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.350 
channel 32 just that coil and did it
while<00:02:18.569> that<00:02:18.840> switched<00:02:19.260> off<00:02:19.700> and<00:02:20.700> I<00:02:20.970> did<00:02:21.180> it

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
while that switched off and I did it

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.500 
while that switched off and I did it
through<00:02:22.140> the<00:02:22.349> control<00:02:22.769> here<00:02:23.280> am<00:02:24.000> I<00:02:24.090> going<00:02:24.269> into

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
through the control here am I going into

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:25.850 
through the control here am I going into
detail<00:02:24.840> you<00:02:24.989> can<00:02:25.049> figure<00:02:25.200> this<00:02:25.349> out<00:02:25.500> yourself

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
detail you can figure this out yourself

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:32.089 
detail you can figure this out yourself
it<00:02:26.010> took<00:02:26.190> me<00:02:26.340> long<00:02:26.549> enough<00:02:28.790> so<00:02:29.790> now<00:02:30.890> there's<00:02:31.890> my

00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:32.099 
it took me long enough so now there's my

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:36.229 
it took me long enough so now there's my
improvements<00:02:32.819> to<00:02:32.940> the<00:02:33.060> dais<00:02:34.370> I've<00:02:35.370> got<00:02:36.000> a

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:36.239 
improvements to the dais I've got a

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:41.059 
improvements to the dais I've got a
spare<00:02:36.750> death<00:02:38.060> don't<00:02:39.060> need<00:02:39.239> that<00:02:39.450> I<00:02:39.950> don't<00:02:40.950> need

00:02:41.059 --> 00:02:41.069 
spare death don't need that I don't need

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:43.309 
spare death don't need that I don't need
that<00:02:41.129> at<00:02:41.519> all<00:02:41.700> it<00:02:42.390> can<00:02:42.599> control<00:02:43.019> everything

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319 
that at all it can control everything

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:47.270

chance to use a dais haha but if you're

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.759 
chance to use a dais haha but if you're
inviting<00:03:16.739> me<00:03:16.890> over<00:03:17.250> I'm<00:03:17.760> not<00:03:18.720> traveling<00:03:19.200> miles

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:19.769 
inviting me over I'm not traveling miles

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:25.849 
inviting me over I'm not traveling miles
and<00:03:20.190> miles<00:03:20.370> and<00:03:20.760> miles<00:03:24.200> this<00:03:25.200> mile<00:03:25.380> to<00:03:25.530> be<00:03:25.650> some

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:25.859 
and miles and miles this mile to be some

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:30.069 
and miles and miles this mile to be some
hiccups<00:03:26.220> in<00:03:26.430> this<00:03:26.609> it's<00:03:27.209> it's<00:03:27.569> far<00:03:27.870> too<00:03:27.900> easy

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:30.079 
hiccups in this it's it's far too easy

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:34.960 
hiccups in this it's it's far too easy
well<00:03:31.079> I<00:03:31.109> reckon<00:03:31.470> maybe<00:03:32.359> if<00:03:33.359> we<00:03:33.690> stay<00:03:33.959> at<00:03:34.019> about

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:34.970 
well I reckon maybe if we stay at about

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:37.159 
well I reckon maybe if we stay at about
50<00:03:35.970> yards<00:03:36.060> apart<00:03:36.269> that<00:03:36.720> would<00:03:36.870> be<00:03:37.019> out<00:03:37.139> of

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:37.169 
50 yards apart that would be out of

00:03:37.169 --> 00:03:40.159 
50 yards apart that would be out of
wireless<00:03:37.530> range<00:03:37.950> so<00:03:38.579> anything<00:03:38.819> I<00:03:39.060> did<00:03:39.299> on<00:03:39.480> with

00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:40.169 
wireless range so anything I did on with

00:03:40.169 --> 00:03:41.990 
wireless range so anything I did on with
the<00:03:40.260> control<00:03:40.650> box<00:03:40.859> wouldn't<00:03:41.609> affect<00:03:41.880> the

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
the control box wouldn't affect the

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.270 
the control box wouldn't affect the
other<00:03:42.030> detector

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:43.280 
other detector

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.520 
other detector
but<00:03:43.610> anyway<00:03:44.180> they<00:03:44.240> will<00:03:44.480> see<00:03:44.750> it<00:03:44.959> needs<00:03:45.230> field

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:45.530 
but anyway they will see it needs field

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:50.380 
but anyway they will see it needs field
testing<00:03:46.069> and<00:03:47.050> volunteers<00:03:48.050> needed
