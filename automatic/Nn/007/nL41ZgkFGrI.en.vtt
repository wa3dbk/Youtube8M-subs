00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:01.280 

so<00:00:00.390> I<00:00:00.420> think<00:00:00.510> the<00:00:00.719> big<00:00:00.900> difference<00:00:01.199> between

00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:01.290 
so I think the big difference between

00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:03.830 
so I think the big difference between
the<00:00:01.589> console<00:00:01.979> wars<00:00:02.159> of<00:00:02.370> the<00:00:02.399> 80s<00:00:02.760> and<00:00:02.850> 90s<00:00:03.030> the

console wars of today between Sony

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.400 
console wars of today between Sony
Microsoft<00:00:08.250> and<00:00:08.940> Nintendo<00:00:09.059> as<00:00:09.510> well<00:00:09.660> the<00:00:10.260> big

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
Microsoft and Nintendo as well the big

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:11.600 
Microsoft and Nintendo as well the big
differences<00:00:10.710> is<00:00:10.860> that<00:00:10.889> back<00:00:11.099> in<00:00:11.130> the<00:00:11.309> day<00:00:11.429> it

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
differences is that back in the day it

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.669 
differences is that back in the day it
really<00:00:11.910> was<00:00:12.090> like<00:00:12.269> the<00:00:12.389> wild<00:00:12.750> wild<00:00:12.929> west<00:00:13.139> these

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
really was like the wild wild west these

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.220 
really was like the wild wild west these
were<00:00:13.889> the<00:00:14.120> lawless<00:00:15.120> days<00:00:15.450> of<00:00:15.660> the<00:00:15.750> industry

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
were the lawless days of the industry

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.380 
were the lawless days of the industry
you<00:00:16.949> know<00:00:17.250> they<00:00:17.490> were<00:00:17.580> writing<00:00:17.940> the<00:00:17.970> rules<00:00:18.210> as

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
you know they were writing the rules as

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:19.790 
you know they were writing the rules as
they<00:00:18.510> went<00:00:18.690> along<00:00:18.810> it<00:00:19.320> wasn't<00:00:19.590> even<00:00:19.650> an

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
they went along it wasn't even an

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.830 
they went along it wasn't even an
industry<00:00:20.189> at<00:00:20.279> the<00:00:20.369> time<00:00:20.400> it<00:00:20.789> was<00:00:20.910> just<00:00:21.119> sort<00:00:21.750> of

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
industry at the time it was just sort of

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.830 
industry at the time it was just sort of
this<00:00:21.960> growing<00:00:22.320> hobby<00:00:22.820> and<00:00:23.820> for<00:00:24.330> that<00:00:24.480> reason

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
this growing hobby and for that reason

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.450 
this growing hobby and for that reason
they<00:00:25.230> were<00:00:25.289> able<00:00:25.470> to<00:00:25.650> take<00:00:25.800> a<00:00:25.830> lot<00:00:26.039> more<00:00:26.220> risks

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
they were able to take a lot more risks

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.089 
they were able to take a lot more risks
and<00:00:26.849> they<00:00:27.359> were<00:00:27.449> also<00:00:27.630> able<00:00:27.810> to<00:00:28.170> do<00:00:28.800> a<00:00:28.830> lot<00:00:29.070> of

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
and they were also able to do a lot of

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:30.470 
and they were also able to do a lot of
things<00:00:29.400> that<00:00:29.640> you<00:00:29.760> probably<00:00:30.060> won't<00:00:30.269> be<00:00:30.390> able

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
things that you probably won't be able

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.150 
things that you probably won't be able
to<00:00:30.570> get<00:00:30.689> away<00:00:30.779> with<00:00:31.019> today<00:00:31.199> I<00:00:31.500> think<00:00:31.920> that

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
to get away with today I think that

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.740 
to get away with today I think that
really<00:00:32.489> makes<00:00:32.759> the<00:00:33.000> story<00:00:33.360> a<00:00:33.420> lot<00:00:33.600> more

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
really makes the story a lot more

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.780 
really makes the story a lot more
compelling<00:00:34.260> because<00:00:34.290> it's<00:00:34.770> sort<00:00:35.640> of<00:00:35.730> that

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
compelling because it's sort of that

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.119 
compelling because it's sort of that
idea<00:00:36.180> of<00:00:36.239> their<00:00:36.840> creating<00:00:37.290> this<00:00:37.410> industry<00:00:37.860> and

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
idea of their creating this industry and

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:39.440 
idea of their creating this industry and
they're<00:00:38.430> this<00:00:38.579> train<00:00:38.850> on<00:00:39.000> the<00:00:39.059> tracks<00:00:39.300> and

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
they're this train on the tracks and

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:40.490 
they're this train on the tracks and
they're<00:00:39.570> putting<00:00:39.719> the<00:00:39.840> tracks<00:00:40.079> down<00:00:40.260> in<00:00:40.379> front

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
they're putting the tracks down in front

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.130 
they're putting the tracks down in front
of<00:00:40.620> them<00:00:40.710> as<00:00:40.800> they<00:00:41.100> go<00:00:41.280> along<00:00:41.690> and<00:00:42.690> the<00:00:42.989> other

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
of them as they go along and the other

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.529 
of them as they go along and the other
thing<00:00:43.290> with<00:00:43.440> today<00:00:43.649> is<00:00:43.860> that<00:00:44.270> you<00:00:45.270> know<00:00:45.390> at<00:00:45.450> the

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
thing with today is that you know at the

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.000 
thing with today is that you know at the
games<00:00:45.750> today<00:00:46.020> are<00:00:46.140> extraordinary<00:00:46.860> the

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
games today are extraordinary the

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.040 
games today are extraordinary the
graphics<00:00:47.370> are<00:00:47.460> incredible<00:00:47.940> but<00:00:48.750> what<00:00:48.870> goes

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
graphics are incredible but what goes

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.139 
graphics are incredible but what goes
into<00:00:49.289> that<00:00:49.379> is<00:00:49.649> a<00:00:49.920> much<00:00:50.219> larger<00:00:50.670> financial

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
into that is a much larger financial

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.569 
into that is a much larger financial
investment<00:00:51.660> and<00:00:51.780> you<00:00:52.350> can't<00:00:52.590> afford<00:00:52.949> to<00:00:53.430> take

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
investment and you can't afford to take

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.700 
investment and you can't afford to take
as<00:00:53.760> many<00:00:53.879> risks<00:00:54.030> whether<00:00:54.780> it<00:00:54.960> be<00:00:55.079> marketing<00:00:55.559> or

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
as many risks whether it be marketing or

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.770 
as many risks whether it be marketing or
product<00:00:55.920> development<00:00:56.399> it's<00:00:57.120> gonna<00:00:57.390> be<00:00:57.750> a

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
product development it's gonna be a

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.660 
product development it's gonna be a
little<00:00:58.469> bit<00:00:58.559> more<00:00:58.680> like<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:59.070> Hollywood<00:00:59.520> model

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
little bit more like the Hollywood model

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.750 
little bit more like the Hollywood model
of<00:00:59.969> bigger<00:01:00.390> tentpole<00:01:01.260> games<00:01:01.680> there's<00:01:02.550> not

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
of bigger tentpole games there's not

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.939 
of bigger tentpole games there's not
gonna<00:01:02.910> really<00:01:03.120> be<00:01:03.390> those<00:01:03.750> niche<00:01:04.049> hits<00:01:04.350> and<00:01:04.589> the

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
gonna really be those niche hits and the

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.490 
gonna really be those niche hits and the
big<00:01:05.400> risks<00:01:05.729> that<00:01:05.880> Sega<00:01:06.180> Nintendo<00:01:06.390> took<00:01:07.170> all

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
big risks that Sega Nintendo took all

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.859 
big risks that Sega Nintendo took all
the<00:01:07.799> time<00:01:08.010> to<00:01:08.400> first<00:01:08.939> establish<00:01:09.270> themselves

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
the time to first establish themselves

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.780 
the time to first establish themselves
and<00:01:10.049> then<00:01:10.140> to<00:01:10.170> succeed<00:01:10.619> another<00:01:11.580> thing<00:01:11.729> that's

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
and then to succeed another thing that's

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.340 
and then to succeed another thing that's
been<00:01:11.909> really<00:01:12.180> interesting<00:01:12.540> to<00:01:12.630> me<00:01:12.659> while

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
been really interesting to me while

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:14.990 
been really interesting to me while
researching<00:01:13.770> and<00:01:13.979> writing<00:01:14.040> console<00:01:14.549> wars<00:01:14.729> is

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
researching and writing console wars is

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.429 
researching and writing console wars is
that<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:15.479> games<00:01:15.689> that<00:01:15.869> I<00:01:15.960> was<00:01:16.110> looking<00:01:16.259> at

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
that the games that I was looking at

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:17.990 
that the games that I was looking at
these<00:01:16.560> 8-bit<00:01:17.009> and<00:01:17.130> 16-bit<00:01:17.250> games<00:01:17.759> are

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
these 8-bit and 16-bit games are

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.690 
these 8-bit and 16-bit games are
actually<00:01:18.240> not<00:01:18.659> all<00:01:18.930> too<00:01:19.439> different<00:01:19.890> from<00:01:20.130> the

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
actually not all too different from the

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.399 
actually not all too different from the
games<00:01:20.909> that<00:01:21.060> you<00:01:21.119> find<00:01:21.390> in<00:01:21.540> the<00:01:21.630> App<00:01:21.780> Store<00:01:21.810> on

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
games that you find in the App Store on

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.469 
games that you find in the App Store on
iTunes<00:01:22.860> and<00:01:23.250> I<00:01:23.369> think<00:01:23.580> that<00:01:23.670> that<00:01:23.820> says<00:01:24.180> a<00:01:24.210> lot

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
iTunes and I think that that says a lot

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.200 
iTunes and I think that that says a lot
about<00:01:24.509> the<00:01:25.140> way<00:01:25.259> that<00:01:25.470> we<00:01:25.790> think<00:01:26.790> about<00:01:26.909> and

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
about the way that we think about and

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.390 
about the way that we think about and
appreciate<00:01:27.420> games<00:01:28.020> so<00:01:28.470> you<00:01:29.040> know<00:01:29.130> it's<00:01:29.280> not

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
appreciate games so you know it's not

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.640 
appreciate games so you know it's not
always<00:01:29.640> about<00:01:29.880> having<00:01:30.420> better<00:01:30.780> graphics<00:01:31.409> and

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
always about having better graphics and

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.069 
always about having better graphics and
bigger<00:01:32.220> explosions<00:01:32.850> it's<00:01:33.180> about<00:01:33.390> just<00:01:33.990> the
