is<00:02:34.710> our<00:02:34.860> fusing<00:02:35.310> piece<00:02:35.550> so<00:02:36.330> this<00:02:36.570> one<00:02:37.310> we<00:02:38.310> can

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:38.490 
is our fusing piece so this one we can

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:40.370 
is our fusing piece so this one we can
go<00:02:38.820> in<00:02:38.940> any<00:02:39.120> CoA<00:02:39.570> of<00:02:39.840> your<00:02:39.959> choice<00:02:40.200> either

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
go in any CoA of your choice either

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:43.040 
go in any CoA of your choice either
ninety<00:02:40.950> or<00:02:41.040> ninety<00:02:41.370> six<00:02:41.640> and<00:02:41.940> this<00:02:42.600> is<00:02:42.780> placed

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
ninety or ninety six and this is placed

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.740 
ninety or ninety six and this is placed
right<00:02:43.320> to<00:02:43.530> the<00:02:43.620> back<00:02:43.800> again<00:02:44.030> the<00:02:45.030> sizes<00:02:45.570> are

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
right to the back again the sizes are

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.860 
right to the back again the sizes are
just<00:02:46.350> identical<00:02:46.970> so<00:02:47.970> when<00:02:48.209> you<00:02:48.330> when<00:02:48.720> they're

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
just identical so when you when they're

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:50.720 
just identical so when you when they're
pressed<00:02:49.140> together<00:02:49.320> they<00:02:49.920> match<00:02:50.250> up<00:02:50.280> right

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
pressed together they match up right

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.910 
pressed together they match up right
along<00:02:50.970> the<00:02:51.120> edges<00:02:51.500> so<00:02:52.500> I'm<00:02:52.590> just<00:02:52.739> going<00:02:52.860> to

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
along the edges so I'm just going to

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:58.160 
along the edges so I'm just going to
temporarily<00:02:53.690> set<00:02:54.690> that<00:02:54.959> down<00:02:55.200> there<00:02:57.140> pull<00:02:58.140> a

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
temporarily set that down there pull a

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.320 
temporarily set that down there pull a
piece<00:02:58.410> of<00:02:58.560> tape<00:02:58.739> here<00:02:58.770> and<00:02:59.250> I'm<00:02:59.970> just<00:03:00.030> going<00:03:00.239> to

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
piece of tape here and I'm just going to

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:06.890 
piece of tape here and I'm just going to
create<00:03:00.600> a<00:03:00.660> tab<00:03:01.040> about<00:03:02.040> a<00:03:02.100> half<00:03:02.340> an<00:03:02.489> inch<00:03:05.900> press

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
create a tab about a half an inch press

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.020 
create a tab about a half an inch press
that<00:03:07.110> down<00:03:07.170> just<00:03:07.709> kind<00:03:08.220> of<00:03:08.250> squeeze<00:03:08.670> it<00:03:08.700> and

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
that down just kind of squeeze it and

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.030 
that down just kind of squeeze it and
just<00:03:09.330> wrap<00:03:09.540> it<00:03:09.570> around<00:03:09.750> now<00:03:10.680> the<00:03:10.770> reason<00:03:11.010> that

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
just wrap it around now the reason that

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.160 
just wrap it around now the reason that
I<00:03:11.220> have<00:03:11.430> the<00:03:11.580> tabs<00:03:11.820> is<00:03:12.060> so<00:03:12.209> it'll<00:03:12.450> be<00:03:12.600> easy<00:03:12.840> to

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
I have the tabs is so it'll be easy to

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:18.470 
I have the tabs is so it'll be easy to
actually<00:03:13.970> later<00:03:14.970> on<00:03:15.090> just<00:03:15.420> pull<00:03:17.270> rather<00:03:18.270> than

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
actually later on just pull rather than

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.060 
actually later on just pull rather than
fumble<00:03:18.840> around<00:03:18.930> with<00:03:19.200> it<00:03:19.470> trying<00:03:19.770> to<00:03:19.860> find

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:20.070 
fumble around with it trying to find

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:30.720 
fumble around with it trying to find
that<00:03:20.280> the<00:03:20.580> edge<00:03:21.709> fit<00:03:22.709> in<00:03:22.830> another<00:03:23.340> tab

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:33.430 

you<00:03:31.730> say<00:03:31.880> I<00:03:31.940> just<00:03:32.120> put<00:03:32.330> for<00:03:32.840> frame<00:03:33.050> this<00:03:33.230> size

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:33.440 
you say I just put for frame this size

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:36.790 
you say I just put for frame this size
I'll<00:03:33.650> put<00:03:34.420> one<00:03:35.420> on<00:03:35.540> each<00:03:35.750> side<00:03:35.780> and<00:03:36.349> one<00:03:36.500> on<00:03:36.560> the

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:36.800 
I'll put one on each side and one on the

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:55.150 
I'll put one on each side and one on the
bottom<00:03:53.080> there<00:03:54.080> we<00:03:54.200> go<00:03:54.349> now<00:03:54.650> we've<00:03:54.860> got<00:03:55.040> the

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:55.160 
bottom there we go now we've got the

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:58.870 
bottom there we go now we've got the
frame<00:03:55.540> now<00:03:56.540> this<00:03:56.750> is<00:03:56.930> what<00:03:57.319> all<00:03:58.250> the<00:03:58.550> prytt<00:03:58.760> is

00:03:58.870 --> 00:03:58.880 
frame now this is what all the prytt is

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:01.000 
frame now this is what all the prytt is
poured<00:03:59.150> in<00:03:59.269> between<00:03:59.630> you<00:04:00.200> can<00:04:00.380> go<00:04:00.500> thinner<00:04:00.769> if

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:01.010 
poured in between you can go thinner if

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:02.830 
poured in between you can go thinner if
you<00:04:01.130> like<00:04:01.340> or<00:04:01.640> you<00:04:01.730> can<00:04:01.790> go<00:04:02.030> wider<00:04:02.360> if<00:04:02.540> you<00:04:02.660> like

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:02.840 
you like or you can go wider if you like

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:04.449 
you like or you can go wider if you like
but<00:04:03.080> this<00:04:03.200> is<00:04:03.260> a<00:04:03.410> good<00:04:03.650> size<00:04:03.860> to<00:04:04.130> start<00:04:04.190> off

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:04.459 
but this is a good size to start off

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:05.940 
but this is a good size to start off
with<00:04:04.670> this<00:04:04.790> is<00:04:04.850> about<00:04:05.060> a<00:04:05.120> quarter<00:04:05.360> of<00:04:05.569> an<00:04:05.660> inch

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:05.950 
with this is about a quarter of an inch

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:10.240 
with this is about a quarter of an inch
again<00:04:07.010> the<00:04:07.340> fusing<00:04:07.760> glass<00:04:08.600> is<00:04:09.130> toward<00:04:10.130> the

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:10.250 
again the fusing glass is toward the

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:14.289 
again the fusing glass is toward the
back<00:04:11.500> okay<00:04:12.500> and<00:04:12.680> that's<00:04:13.160> all<00:04:13.610> the<00:04:14.000> risks<00:04:14.239> of

00:04:14.289 --> 00:04:14.299 
back okay and that's all the risks of

00:04:14.299 --> 00:04:21.580 
back okay and that's all the risks of
putting<00:04:14.540> a<00:04:14.630> frame<00:04:14.780> together<00:04:20.229> now<00:04:21.229> this<00:04:21.440> is

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:21.590 
putting a frame together now this is

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:23.590 
putting a frame together now this is
just<00:04:21.799> a<00:04:21.919> simple<00:04:22.280> base<00:04:22.430> what<00:04:22.940> I've<00:04:23.060> done<00:04:23.270> here

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:23.600 
just a simple base what I've done here

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:27.490 
just a simple base what I've done here
is<00:04:23.780> just<00:04:24.020> taking<00:04:24.470> a<00:04:24.680> flat<00:04:25.190> piece<00:04:25.370> of<00:04:25.430> wood<00:04:26.500> this

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:27.500 
is just taking a flat piece of wood this

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:30.370 
is just taking a flat piece of wood this
is<00:04:27.560> actually<00:04:28.040> just<00:04:28.270> scrap<00:04:29.270> molding<00:04:29.900> probably

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:30.380 
is actually just scrap molding probably

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:32.469 
is actually just scrap molding probably
cost<00:04:30.530> me<00:04:30.710> about<00:04:30.800> $0.50<00:04:31.580> and<00:04:31.940> these<00:04:32.240> are<00:04:32.389> about

00:04:32.469 --> 00:04:32.479 
cost me about $0.50 and these are about

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:35.980 
cost me about $0.50 and these are about
a<00:04:32.960> half<00:04:33.440> inch<00:04:33.740> by<00:04:33.979> half<00:04:34.220> inch<00:04:34.430> square<00:04:35.330> password

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:35.990 
a half inch by half inch square password

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:38.050 
a half inch by half inch square password
that<00:04:36.140> I've<00:04:36.289> cut<00:04:36.530> off<00:04:36.710> and<00:04:37.460> what<00:04:37.580> I<00:04:37.610> want<00:04:37.850> to<00:04:37.910> do

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:38.060 
that I've cut off and what I want to do

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:40.930 
that I've cut off and what I want to do
is<00:04:38.300> all<00:04:39.080> this<00:04:39.380> is<00:04:39.620> is<00:04:39.770> just<00:04:39.800> a<00:04:40.130> base<00:04:40.340> that<00:04:40.760> once

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:40.940 
is all this is is just a base that once

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:43.779 
is all this is is just a base that once
so<00:04:41.570> that<00:04:41.600> you<00:04:41.780> can<00:04:41.930> keep<00:04:42.110> your<00:04:42.260> frame<00:04:42.950> flat<00:04:43.490> and

00:04:43.779 --> 00:04:43.789 
so that you can keep your frame flat and

00:04:43.789 --> 00:04:46.810 
so that you can keep your frame flat and
solid<00:04:44.450> so<00:04:45.080> that<00:04:45.350> when<00:04:45.590> you<00:04:45.710> put<00:04:46.400> it<00:04:46.520> in<00:04:46.640> there

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:46.820 
solid so that when you put it in there

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:49.420 
solid so that when you put it in there
that<00:04:47.150> drops<00:04:47.990> right<00:04:48.229> in<00:04:48.350> there<00:04:48.560> and<00:04:48.890> you<00:04:48.950> can

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:49.430 
that drops right in there and you can

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:50.860 
that drops right in there and you can
watch<00:04:49.610> something<00:04:50.000> in<00:04:50.120> the<00:04:50.210> back<00:04:50.390> to<00:04:50.600> keep<00:04:50.630> it

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:50.870 
watch something in the back to keep it

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:53.050 
watch something in the back to keep it
from<00:04:51.020> wobbly<00:04:51.680> wobbly<00:04:52.220> and<00:04:52.490> you<00:04:52.580> don't<00:04:52.760> want<00:04:52.970> to

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:53.060 
from wobbly wobbly and you don't want to

00:04:53.060 --> 00:05:07.480 
from wobbly wobbly and you don't want to
do<00:04:53.210> this<00:04:53.680> but<00:04:54.680> you<00:04:54.800> want<00:04:54.950> it<00:04:55.010> nice<00:04:55.160> and<00:04:55.220> sturdy

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:07.490 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:09.619 

now<00:05:08.490> I'm<00:05:08.580> going<00:05:08.819> to<00:05:08.879> actually<00:05:09.000> show<00:05:09.240> you<00:05:09.509> how

00:05:09.619 --> 00:05:09.629 
now I'm going to actually show you how

00:05:09.629 --> 00:05:11.570 
now I'm going to actually show you how
we<00:05:09.810> release<00:05:10.319> the<00:05:10.530> picture<00:05:10.889> or<00:05:11.099> release<00:05:11.370> the
