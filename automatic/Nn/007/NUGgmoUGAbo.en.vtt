it<00:01:44.100> does<00:01:44.280> have<00:01:44.520> a<00:01:44.579> full<00:01:44.939> weakness<00:01:45.360> to<00:01:45.509> ground

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
it does have a full weakness to ground

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.289 
it does have a full weakness to ground
so<00:01:46.079> that's<00:01:46.860> why<00:01:47.070> I<00:01:47.100> actually<00:01:47.340> have<00:01:47.820> hydrogen

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
so that's why I actually have hydrogen

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.090 
so that's why I actually have hydrogen
in<00:01:48.390> the<00:01:48.479> second<00:01:48.780> slot<00:01:48.930> I've<00:01:49.290> had<00:01:49.619> to<00:01:49.770> run<00:01:49.920> turn

the first slot he just earthquakes and

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:52.969 
the first slot he just earthquakes and
there's<00:01:51.899> a<00:01:51.930> lot<00:01:52.110> of<00:01:52.200> damage<00:01:52.409> to<00:01:52.500> the<00:01:52.649> first<00:01:52.860> two

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
there's a lot of damage to the first two

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.959 
there's a lot of damage to the first two
Pokemon<00:01:53.399> and<00:01:53.549> you<00:01:53.640> just<00:01:53.820> took<00:01:53.939> out<00:01:54.060> my<00:01:54.210> stormy

what was I even talking about yeah you

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:07.850 
what was I even talking about yeah you
earthquake<00:02:06.690> and<00:02:06.870> you<00:02:06.930> killed<00:02:07.140> a<00:02:07.260> Pokemon<00:02:07.770> in

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
earthquake and you killed a Pokemon in

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.530 
earthquake and you killed a Pokemon in
the<00:02:07.920> corner<00:02:08.310> if<00:02:08.460> you<00:02:08.520> earthquake<00:02:08.880> well<00:02:09.300> in<00:02:09.450> the

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:09.540 
the corner if you earthquake well in the

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:11.270 
the corner if you earthquake well in the
middle<00:02:09.899> then<00:02:10.200> you<00:02:10.380> have<00:02:10.560> to<00:02:10.800> you'll<00:02:11.009> hit<00:02:11.130> all

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
middle then you have to you'll hit all

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.770 
middle then you have to you'll hit all
six<00:02:11.580> pokémon<00:02:11.790> but<00:02:12.060> I<00:02:12.090> don't<00:02:12.240> have<00:02:12.330> to<00:02:12.450> Pokemon

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.490 
six pokémon but I don't have to Pokemon
with<00:02:12.870> levity

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
with levity

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.620 
with levity
so<00:02:13.800> that<00:02:13.950> whimsicott<00:02:14.460> is<00:02:14.610> a<00:02:14.640> big<00:02:15.060> threat<00:02:15.420> if<00:02:15.540> it

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
so that whimsicott is a big threat if it

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.180 
so that whimsicott is a big threat if it
uses<00:02:15.750> a<00:02:15.930> fairy<00:02:16.260> move<00:02:16.470> on<00:02:16.590> my<00:02:16.680> hide<00:02:16.830> reek<00:02:17.070> and

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
I'm gonna go ahead and use super power

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.250 
I'm gonna go ahead and use super power
on<00:02:28.200> that<00:02:28.410> magnet<00:02:28.740> on<00:02:29.360> my<00:02:30.360> malamar<00:02:30.840> has<00:02:31.050> the

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
on that magnet on my malamar has the

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.140 
on that magnet on my malamar has the
ability<00:02:31.590> contrary<00:02:32.190> which<00:02:32.460> makes<00:02:32.730> it<00:02:32.850> so<00:02:32.970> if<00:02:33.060> I

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
ability contrary which makes it so if I

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.580 
ability contrary which makes it so if I
use<00:02:33.300> a<00:02:33.330> move<00:02:33.660> and<00:02:34.760> well<00:02:35.760> if<00:02:35.910> I<00:02:36.000> use<00:02:36.030> a<00:02:36.150> if<00:02:37.080> my<00:02:37.170> if

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
use a move and well if I use a if my if

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.470 
use a move and well if I use a if my if
a<00:02:37.740> stat<00:02:37.980> is<00:02:38.130> to<00:02:38.310> go<00:02:38.430> down<00:02:38.640> it'll<00:02:39.030> actually<00:02:39.120> go

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
a stat is to go down it'll actually go

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.390 
a stat is to go down it'll actually go
up<00:02:39.720> so<00:02:40.080> that's<00:02:40.560> actually<00:02:40.980> really<00:02:41.160> good

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
up so that's actually really good

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.760 
up so that's actually really good
so<00:02:42.120> this<00:02:42.630> earthquakes<00:02:43.080> not<00:02:43.350> gonna<00:02:43.500> do<00:02:43.650> too

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:43.770 
so this earthquakes not gonna do too

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:45.350 
so this earthquakes not gonna do too
much<00:02:43.860> damage<00:02:44.310> I<00:02:44.400> only<00:02:44.520> did<00:02:44.730> it<00:02:44.760> to<00:02:44.850> distribute

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
much damage I only did it to distribute

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:46.310 
much damage I only did it to distribute
a<00:02:45.420> good<00:02:45.540> amount<00:02:45.750> of<00:02:45.780> damage<00:02:45.930> to<00:02:46.170> both<00:02:46.260> the

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:46.320 
a good amount of damage to both the

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:50.120 
a good amount of damage to both the
Pokemon<00:02:46.800> and<00:02:47.900> Wow<00:02:48.959> magnet<00:02:49.740> sounds<00:02:49.920> pretty

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
Pokemon and Wow magnet sounds pretty

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:51.830 
Pokemon and Wow magnet sounds pretty
fast<00:02:50.310> I<00:02:50.459> mean<00:02:50.550> Magneton<00:02:50.970> are<00:02:51.090> usually<00:02:51.540> fast

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
fast I mean Magneton are usually fast

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.630 
fast I mean Magneton are usually fast
unless<00:02:52.260> you're<00:02:52.440> running<00:02:52.530> like<00:02:52.800> a<00:02:52.830> slow<00:02:53.280> and

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
unless you're running like a slow and

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.460 
unless you're running like a slow and
physical<00:02:54.480> and<00:02:54.600> special<00:02:54.930> moves<00:02:55.110> set<00:02:55.350> which

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
physical and special moves set which

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.490 
physical and special moves set which
I've<00:02:55.590> actually<00:02:55.740> seen<00:02:56.070> some<00:02:56.280> people<00:02:56.520> run<00:02:56.700> but

again<00:02:58.500> it's<00:02:58.680> really<00:02:58.860> good<00:02:59.070> idea<00:02:59.250> to<00:02:59.280> bring

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
again it's really good idea to bring

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:00.440 
again it's really good idea to bring
your<00:02:59.490> ground<00:02:59.730> time<00:02:59.940> because<00:03:00.090> the<00:03:00.180> killer's

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
your ground time because the killer's

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.480 
your ground time because the killer's
both<00:03:00.660> my<00:03:00.840> cargo<00:03:01.080> and<00:03:01.260> Magneton<00:03:01.890> pretty<00:03:02.340> much

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:02.490 
both my cargo and Magneton pretty much

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:05.570 
both my cargo and Magneton pretty much
instantly<00:03:03.030> so<00:03:03.740> it's<00:03:04.740> kind<00:03:04.950> of<00:03:05.010> stupid<00:03:05.250> at<00:03:05.520> the

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:05.580 
instantly so it's kind of stupid at the

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:08.270 
instantly so it's kind of stupid at the
