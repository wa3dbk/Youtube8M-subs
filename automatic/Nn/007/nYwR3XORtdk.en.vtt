was<00:01:46.170> trying<00:01:46.500> it<00:01:46.619> on<00:01:46.710> while<00:01:47.040> expanding<00:01:47.820> and

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
was trying it on while expanding and

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.940 
was trying it on while expanding and
adjusting<00:01:48.479> those<00:01:48.630> holes<00:01:48.899> but<00:01:49.320> it<00:01:49.590> was<00:01:49.680> a<00:01:49.710> lot

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
adjusting those holes but it was a lot

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.740 
adjusting those holes but it was a lot
of<00:01:49.979> wriggling<00:01:50.579> around<00:01:50.880> and<00:01:51.329> not<00:01:51.630> very

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
of wriggling around and not very

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.139 
of wriggling around and not very
attractive<00:01:51.930> so<00:01:52.649> you<00:01:52.710> guys<00:01:53.130> don't<00:01:53.520> get<00:01:53.759> to<00:01:53.820> see

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
attractive so you guys don't get to see

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:55.930 
attractive so you guys don't get to see
that<00:01:54.329> and<00:01:54.840> I<00:01:55.020> also<00:01:55.229> cut<00:01:55.619> off

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:55.940 
that and I also cut off

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:58.060 
that and I also cut off
bottom<00:01:56.240> of<00:01:56.330> the<00:01:56.360> box<00:01:56.900> so<00:01:57.050> I<00:01:57.080> would<00:01:57.440> be<00:01:57.470> able<00:01:57.680> to

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:58.070 
bottom of the box so I would be able to

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:00.640 
bottom of the box so I would be able to
wear<00:01:58.370> it<00:01:58.550> at<00:01:59.000> this<00:01:59.240> point<00:01:59.510> you<00:01:59.720> could<00:01:59.930> stop<00:02:00.290> and

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:00.650 
wear it at this point you could stop and

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:04.150 
wear it at this point you could stop and
use<00:02:00.980> it<00:02:01.160> as<00:02:01.370> a<00:02:01.400> boxtrolls<00:02:02.240> cosplay<00:02:02.870> but<00:02:03.290> I<00:02:03.590> have

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:04.160 
use it as a boxtrolls cosplay but I have

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:06.220 
use it as a boxtrolls cosplay but I have
a<00:02:04.460> little<00:02:04.640> more<00:02:04.850> work<00:02:05.060> I<00:02:05.180> want<00:02:05.390> to<00:02:05.450> do<00:02:05.600> so<00:02:06.050> once

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:06.230 
a little more work I want to do so once

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:07.930 
a little more work I want to do so once
the<00:02:06.380> arm<00:02:06.590> and<00:02:06.830> the<00:02:06.950> head<00:02:07.070> holes<00:02:07.340> were<00:02:07.640> fully

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:07.940 
the arm and the head holes were fully

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:10.180 
the arm and the head holes were fully
cut<00:02:08.180> out<00:02:08.330> I<00:02:08.660> measured<00:02:09.290> the<00:02:09.470> front<00:02:09.770> of<00:02:09.890> the<00:02:10.010> box

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190 
cut out I measured the front of the box

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:12.400 
cut out I measured the front of the box
and<00:02:10.550> cut<00:02:10.850> out<00:02:10.970> two<00:02:11.270> pieces<00:02:11.300> of<00:02:11.720> cardboard<00:02:12.110> that

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
and cut out two pieces of cardboard that

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:15.040 
and cut out two pieces of cardboard that
were<00:02:12.680> the<00:02:12.830> exact<00:02:13.250> same<00:02:13.400> size<00:02:13.880> one<00:02:14.600> was<00:02:14.900> to

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.050 
were the exact same size one was to

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:16.660 
were the exact same size one was to
cover<00:02:15.230> up<00:02:15.410> the<00:02:15.500> front<00:02:15.740> so<00:02:16.100> that<00:02:16.280> it<00:02:16.460> has<00:02:16.640> a

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
cover up the front so that it has a

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.270 
cover up the front so that it has a
smoother<00:02:17.480> surface<00:02:17.590> while<00:02:18.590> the<00:02:18.770> other<00:02:18.950> will

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
smoother surface while the other will

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.700 
smoother surface while the other will
become<00:02:19.580> the<00:02:19.790> back<00:02:20.000> of<00:02:20.270> the<00:02:20.420> box<00:02:20.600> I<00:02:21.050> also<00:02:21.350> then

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:21.710 
become the back of the box I also then

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:23.830 
become the back of the box I also then
made<00:02:21.920> a<00:02:21.950> pattern<00:02:22.400> of<00:02:22.610> an<00:02:22.730> ampersand<00:02:23.240> that<00:02:23.600> fit

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
made a pattern of an ampersand that fit

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.140 
made a pattern of an ampersand that fit
the<00:02:24.020> proportions<00:02:24.620> of<00:02:24.890> my<00:02:25.130> box<00:02:25.340> I<00:02:25.790> ended<00:02:26.060> up

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
the proportions of my box I ended up

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.540 
the proportions of my box I ended up
going<00:02:26.330> with<00:02:26.510> the<00:02:26.750> font<00:02:26.990> din<00:02:27.350> but<00:02:27.950> if<00:02:28.190> you<00:02:28.370> make

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:28.550 
going with the font din but if you make

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:30.550 
going with the font din but if you make
this<00:02:28.670> costume<00:02:28.910> you<00:02:29.450> can<00:02:29.600> obviously<00:02:29.990> use<00:02:30.140> any

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
this costume you can obviously use any

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.860 
this costume you can obviously use any
character<00:02:31.010> and<00:02:31.340> any<00:02:31.550> font<00:02:31.910> that<00:02:32.090> you<00:02:32.270> like<00:02:32.390> oh

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
character and any font that you like oh

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:34.960 
character and any font that you like oh
and<00:02:33.290> before<00:02:33.470> anyone<00:02:33.980> gets<00:02:34.130> on<00:02:34.310> my<00:02:34.430> case<00:02:34.670> the

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
and before anyone gets on my case the

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.150 
and before anyone gets on my case the
ampersand<00:02:35.570> is<00:02:35.810> supposed<00:02:36.290> to<00:02:36.440> be<00:02:36.620> backwards

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160 
ampersand is supposed to be backwards

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.790 
ampersand is supposed to be backwards
because<00:02:37.610> once<00:02:38.270> you<00:02:38.420> print<00:02:38.660> from<00:02:38.960> it<00:02:39.170> then<00:02:39.560> the

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:39.800 
because once you print from it then the

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:43.060 
because once you print from it then the
print<00:02:40.100> is<00:02:40.460> the<00:02:40.790> right-side<00:02:41.360> around<00:02:41.990> so<00:02:42.440> yes

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:43.070 
print is the right-side around so yes

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:45.310 
print is the right-side around so yes
supposed<00:02:43.730> to<00:02:43.880> be<00:02:43.970> backwards<00:02:44.180> so<00:02:44.870> I<00:02:44.900> made<00:02:45.230> the

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:45.320 
supposed to be backwards so I made the

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:47.050 
supposed to be backwards so I made the
pattern<00:02:45.470> in<00:02:45.980> the<00:02:46.070> same<00:02:46.280> way<00:02:46.490> that<00:02:46.730> I<00:02:46.790> showed

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
pattern in the same way that I showed

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:50.050 
pattern in the same way that I showed
you<00:02:47.120> in<00:02:47.510> this<00:02:47.990> video<00:02:48.230> and<00:02:48.740> then<00:02:49.250> I<00:02:49.280> traced<00:02:49.880> it

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.060 
you in this video and then I traced it

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:51.940 
you in this video and then I traced it
and<00:02:50.330> cut<00:02:50.600> it<00:02:50.630> out<00:02:50.870> from<00:02:51.260> another<00:02:51.650> piece<00:02:51.920> of

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
and cut it out from another piece of

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:54.670 
and cut it out from another piece of
cardboard<00:02:52.310> not<00:02:53.000> once<00:02:53.240> not<00:02:53.810> twice<00:02:53.990> but<00:02:54.110> three

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
cardboard not once not twice but three

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.580 
cardboard not once not twice but three
times<00:02:55.030> my<00:02:56.030> hand<00:02:56.180> was<00:02:56.480> very<00:02:56.600> sore<00:02:57.080> by<00:02:57.320> the<00:02:57.380> end

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.590 
times my hand was very sore by the end

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:59.410 
times my hand was very sore by the end
of<00:02:57.710> that<00:02:57.830> day<00:02:58.040> but<00:02:58.490> I<00:02:58.550> wanted<00:02:59.000> three<00:02:59.120> of<00:02:59.300> them

00:02:59.410 --> 00:02:59.420 
of that day but I wanted three of them

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:00.850 
of that day but I wanted three of them
so<00:02:59.690> that<00:02:59.840> I<00:02:59.870> could<00:03:00.140> really<00:03:00.320> get<00:03:00.560> the<00:03:00.650> height

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:00.860 
so that I could really get the height

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:02.949 
so that I could really get the height
that<00:03:01.160> I<00:03:01.310> wanted<00:03:01.640> to<00:03:01.940> mimic<00:03:02.209> a<00:03:02.570> wooden

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:02.959 
that I wanted to mimic a wooden

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:04.840 
that I wanted to mimic a wooden
letterpress<00:03:03.560> block<00:03:03.860> so<00:03:04.280> once<00:03:04.489> all<00:03:04.700> three

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:04.850 
letterpress block so once all three

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:06.760 
letterpress block so once all three
ampersands<00:03:05.540> were<00:03:05.660> cut<00:03:05.840> out<00:03:05.870> I<00:03:06.260> chose<00:03:06.500> which

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:06.770 
ampersands were cut out I chose which

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:09.100 
ampersands were cut out I chose which
one<00:03:06.830> I<00:03:07.280> wanted<00:03:07.580> to<00:03:07.640> be<00:03:07.730> on<00:03:08.060> top<00:03:08.330> and<00:03:08.660> then<00:03:09.080> I

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:09.110 
one I wanted to be on top and then I

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:10.900 
one I wanted to be on top and then I
have<00:03:09.290> glued<00:03:09.680> that<00:03:09.709> and<00:03:10.220> the<00:03:10.430> second<00:03:10.790> one

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:10.910 
have glued that and the second one

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:13.210 
have glued that and the second one
together<00:03:11.330> and<00:03:11.660> then<00:03:11.870> I<00:03:12.080> used<00:03:12.260> a<00:03:12.410> sharp<00:03:12.709> x-acto

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 
together and then I used a sharp x-acto

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:15.100 
together and then I used a sharp x-acto
knife<00:03:13.370> to<00:03:13.400> trim<00:03:13.880> down<00:03:14.150> that<00:03:14.330> any<00:03:14.450> areas<00:03:14.870> where

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:15.110 
knife to trim down that any areas where

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:17.020 
knife to trim down that any areas where
they<00:03:15.200> didn't<00:03:15.500> quite<00:03:15.770> line<00:03:16.040> up<00:03:16.070> and<00:03:16.550> then<00:03:17.000> I

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030 
they didn't quite line up and then I

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:19.360 
they didn't quite line up and then I
glued<00:03:17.390> on<00:03:17.540> the<00:03:17.750> third<00:03:17.989> ampersand<00:03:18.709> and<00:03:19.100> did<00:03:19.250> the

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.370 
glued on the third ampersand and did the

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:21.280 
glued on the third ampersand and did the
same<00:03:19.550> thing<00:03:19.610> after<00:03:20.180> that<00:03:20.510> it<00:03:20.780> was<00:03:20.870> just<00:03:21.110> time

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.290 
same thing after that it was just time

was<00:03:38.720> worth<00:03:38.900> it<00:03:39.080> and<00:03:39.380> then<00:03:39.650> on<00:03:39.920> the<00:03:40.040> main<00:03:40.250> body

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:40.459
