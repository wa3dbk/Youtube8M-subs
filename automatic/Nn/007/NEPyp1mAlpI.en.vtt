working around even if you're

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:35.720 
working around even if you're
continually<00:00:33.690> working<00:00:34.170> around<00:00:34.559> or<00:00:35.010> whether

continually working around or whether

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.260 
continually working around or whether

sometimes<00:00:39.870> creates<00:00:40.320> a<00:00:40.559> little<00:00:40.829> pucker<00:00:41.540> or<00:00:42.540> a

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
sometimes creates a little pucker or a

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.680 
sometimes creates a little pucker or a
gap<00:00:43.110> it<00:00:43.950> has<00:00:44.160> a<00:00:44.190> extra<00:00:44.790> bulk<00:00:45.000> of<00:00:45.239> that<00:00:45.390> slip

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
gap it has a extra bulk of that slip

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.250 
gap it has a extra bulk of that slip
stitch<00:00:45.930> and<00:00:46.489> so<00:00:47.489> it<00:00:48.120> does<00:00:48.420> either<00:00:48.809> those

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
stitch and so it does either those

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.139 
stitch and so it does either those
things<00:00:49.589> and<00:00:49.739> just<00:00:49.949> doesn't<00:00:50.190> look<00:00:50.460> as<00:00:50.670> neat<00:00:50.940> and

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
things and just doesn't look as neat and

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.319 
things and just doesn't look as neat and
as<00:00:51.300> nice<00:00:52.460> and<00:00:53.460> actually<00:00:53.850> if<00:00:53.940> you're<00:00:54.059> working

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
as nice and actually if you're working

it in a continually continual round

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.540 
it in a continually continual round
you<00:00:58.320> probably<00:00:58.530> want<00:00:58.859> one<00:00:59.039> to<00:00:59.129> slip<00:00:59.339> stitch

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
you probably want one to slip stitch

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.880 
you probably want one to slip stitch
because<00:00:59.789> it<00:00:59.940> actually<00:01:00.179> inverts<00:01:00.839> the<00:01:01.140> fabric<00:01:01.710> a

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
because it actually inverts the fabric a

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.040 
because it actually inverts the fabric a

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
to yarn over as four half double crochet

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.670 
to yarn over as four half double crochet
and<00:01:30.329> we're<00:01:30.540> gonna<00:01:30.630> insert<00:01:31.020> the<00:01:31.229> hook<00:01:31.380> into<00:01:31.590> the

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
and we're gonna insert the hook into the

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.109 
and we're gonna insert the hook into the
stitch<00:01:32.030> and<00:01:33.049> we're<00:01:34.049> gonna<00:01:34.140> pull<00:01:34.439> up<00:01:34.560> a<00:01:34.649> loop

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:35.119 
stitch and we're gonna pull up a loop

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:37.850 
stitch and we're gonna pull up a loop
then<00:01:36.119> we're<00:01:36.270> going<00:01:36.390> to<00:01:36.450> insert<00:01:36.840> the<00:01:37.110> hook<00:01:37.289> into

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
then we're going to insert the hook into

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.950 
then we're going to insert the hook into
the<00:01:38.700> first<00:01:39.000> stitch<00:01:41.450> yarn<00:01:42.450> over<00:01:42.719> and<00:01:42.750> pull

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
the first stitch yarn over and pull

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.410 
the first stitch yarn over and pull
through<00:01:43.110> all<00:01:43.380> these<00:01:43.860> loops<00:01:44.280> on<00:01:44.759> the<00:01:45.390> hook

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
through all these loops on the hook

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.279 
through all these loops on the hook
somewhat<00:01:46.409> like<00:01:46.590> a<00:01:46.619> slip<00:01:46.920> stitch<00:01:47.070> and<00:01:48.289> there

00:01:49.279 --> 00:01:49.289 
somewhat like a slip stitch and there

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:52.520 
somewhat like a slip stitch and there
you<00:01:49.469> go<00:01:49.619> it's<00:01:49.859> almost<00:01:50.189> an<00:01:50.430> imperceptible<00:01:51.530> as

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
you go it's almost an imperceptible as

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.219 
you go it's almost an imperceptible as
you<00:01:52.619> can<00:01:52.740> see<00:01:52.920> if<00:01:53.159> it's<00:01:53.789> almost<00:01:54.060> it's<00:01:54.479> pretty

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
you can see if it's almost it's pretty

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.069 
you can see if it's almost it's pretty
much<00:01:55.380> flush<00:01:55.969> so<00:01:56.969> i'm<00:01:57.329> gonna<00:01:57.450> demonstrate<00:01:57.630> that

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
much flush so i'm gonna demonstrate that

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:05.040 
much flush so i'm gonna demonstrate that
one<00:01:58.259> more<00:01:58.439> time

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:05.050 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:12.490 

again<00:02:06.050> you're<00:02:06.229> going<00:02:06.320> to<00:02:06.380> work<00:02:06.590> for<00:02:11.500> half

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
again you're going to work for half

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.010 
again you're going to work for half
double<00:02:12.830> crochet<00:02:13.130> and<00:02:13.430> then<00:02:14.000> stead<00:02:14.420> instead<00:02:14.900> of

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:15.020 
double crochet and then stead instead of

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:16.330 
double crochet and then stead instead of
yarning<00:02:15.380> over<00:02:15.470> and<00:02:15.680> pulling<00:02:15.830> through<00:02:16.190> all

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
yarning over and pulling through all

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.100 
yarning over and pulling through all
three<00:02:16.760> loops<00:02:16.910> on<00:02:17.180> the<00:02:17.270> hook<00:02:17.300> you're<00:02:17.900> going<00:02:18.020> to

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
three loops on the hook you're going to

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:21.880 
three loops on the hook you're going to
insert<00:02:18.530> into<00:02:18.890> the<00:02:19.370> first<00:02:20.090> stitch<00:02:20.620> that<00:02:21.620> began

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
insert into the first stitch that began

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:25.090 
insert into the first stitch that began
the<00:02:22.070> rail<00:02:23.230> yarn<00:02:24.230> over<00:02:24.440> and<00:02:24.470> pull<00:02:24.590> through<00:02:24.740> all

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:25.100 
the rail yarn over and pull through all

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:28.390 
the rail yarn over and pull through all
the<00:02:25.130> loops<00:02:25.340> on<00:02:25.700> the<00:02:25.820> hook<00:02:25.850> and<00:02:26.920> then<00:02:27.920> you<00:02:28.130> would

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
the loops on the hook and then you would

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.449 
the loops on the hook and then you would
you<00:02:29.390> know<00:02:29.480> work<00:02:29.720> your<00:02:29.900> chain<00:02:30.140> and<00:02:30.500> either<00:02:31.100> turn

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:31.459 
you know work your chain and either turn

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:35.500 
you know work your chain and either turn

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
there and that's all there is to a
