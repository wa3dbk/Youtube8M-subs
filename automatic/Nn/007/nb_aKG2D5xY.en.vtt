00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.230 
hexxus this is a syndicate I've chosen
to<00:00:10.740> align<00:00:11.040> myself<00:00:11.250> with<00:00:11.519> and<00:00:12.000> I<00:00:12.030> honestly

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
to align myself with and I honestly

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.660 
to align myself with and I honestly
expect<00:00:12.900> a<00:00:13.049> lot<00:00:13.259> of<00:00:13.290> players<00:00:13.559> to<00:00:13.650> do<00:00:13.920> so<00:00:14.190> as<00:00:14.429> well

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
expect a lot of players to do so as well

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.160 
expect a lot of players to do so as well
just<00:00:14.940> because<00:00:15.089> some<00:00:15.420> of<00:00:15.480> the<00:00:15.570> rewards<00:00:16.049> they

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
just because some of the rewards they

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.710 
just because some of the rewards they
are<00:00:16.289> offering<00:00:16.710> are<00:00:16.949> just<00:00:17.580> far<00:00:18.090> better<00:00:18.449> than

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
are offering are just far better than

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.450 
are offering are just far better than
all<00:00:19.020> the<00:00:19.140> other<00:00:19.260> syndicates<00:00:19.710> in<00:00:19.830> my<00:00:20.039> opinion

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
all the other syndicates in my opinion

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:21.620 
all the other syndicates in my opinion
so<00:00:20.550> I'm<00:00:20.609> going<00:00:20.730> to<00:00:20.789> talk<00:00:20.939> through<00:00:20.970> why<00:00:21.390> I<00:00:21.420> think

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
so I'm going to talk through why I think

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.420 
so I'm going to talk through why I think
so<00:00:21.990> and<00:00:22.170> why<00:00:22.289> some<00:00:22.619> of<00:00:22.680> the<00:00:22.769> audience<00:00:23.220> kind<00:00:23.369> of

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
so and why some of the audience kind of

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.070 
so and why some of the audience kind of
stand<00:00:23.640> out<00:00:23.730> to<00:00:23.910> me<00:00:24.000> the<00:00:24.119> first<00:00:24.269> one<00:00:24.510> that<00:00:24.930> I<00:00:24.990> saw

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
stand out to me the first one that I saw

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.939 
stand out to me the first one that I saw
was<00:00:25.949> this<00:00:26.340> one<00:00:26.550> right<00:00:26.640> here<00:00:26.820> 5<00:00:27.689> T<00:00:28.109> for<00:00:28.349> survival

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
was this one right here 5 T for survival

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.999 
was this one right here 5 T for survival
Keys<00:00:29.160> is<00:00:29.400> definitely<00:00:30.000> nice<00:00:30.560> because<00:00:31.560> I<00:00:31.590> mean<00:00:31.830> T

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
Keys is definitely nice because I mean T

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.440 
Keys is definitely nice because I mean T
for<00:00:32.189> survival<00:00:32.610> suppose<00:00:32.850> you<00:00:32.969> don't<00:00:33.059> know<00:00:33.180> is

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
for survival suppose you don't know is

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.600 
for survival suppose you don't know is
the<00:00:33.600> best<00:00:33.840> place<00:00:34.140> to<00:00:34.320> farm<00:00:34.559> rare<00:00:35.040> v<00:00:35.250> fusion

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
the best place to farm rare v fusion

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:36.470 
the best place to farm rare v fusion
cores<00:00:35.760> because<00:00:35.940> you<00:00:36.030> have<00:00:36.120> a<00:00:36.149> chance<00:00:36.300> of

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
cores because you have a chance of

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.450 
cores because you have a chance of
getting<00:00:36.540> the<00:00:36.719> 5<00:00:36.930> packs<00:00:37.260> them<00:00:37.559> every<00:00:37.860> 5<00:00:38.070> minutes

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
getting the 5 packs them every 5 minutes

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.369 
getting the 5 packs them every 5 minutes
technically<00:00:38.820> so<00:00:39.300> unless<00:00:39.780> I'm<00:00:39.989> running<00:00:40.260> for

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
technically so unless I'm running for

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.560 
technically so unless I'm running for
something<00:00:40.710> specific<00:00:41.309> for<00:00:41.520> a<00:00:41.550> prime<00:00:41.850> part<00:00:42.149> this

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
something specific for a prime part this

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.360 
something specific for a prime part this
is<00:00:42.690> the<00:00:42.780> void<00:00:42.960> mission<00:00:43.320> I<00:00:43.410> run<00:00:43.680> just<00:00:43.860> to<00:00:44.160> farm

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
is the void mission I run just to farm

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.400 
is the void mission I run just to farm
up<00:00:44.460> my<00:00:44.610> fusion<00:00:44.850> cores<00:00:45.149> so<00:00:45.420> really<00:00:46.050> good<00:00:46.200> pick

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
up my fusion cores so really good pick

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.110 
up my fusion cores so really good pick
up<00:00:46.559> right<00:00:46.739> there<00:00:46.950> another<00:00:47.399> one<00:00:47.670> the<00:00:47.879> large

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
up right there another one the large

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.240 
up right there another one the large
team<00:00:48.480> energy<00:00:48.870> restore<00:00:49.170> is<00:00:49.320> the<00:00:49.500> best<00:00:49.739> value<00:00:49.980> in

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
team energy restore is the best value in

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.130 
team energy restore is the best value in
my<00:00:50.399> opinion<00:00:50.730> out<00:00:50.910> of<00:00:51.059> you<00:00:51.510> know<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:51.719> a<00:00:51.750> Mercer

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
my opinion out of you know the a Mercer

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.479 
my opinion out of you know the a Mercer
in<00:00:52.230> the<00:00:52.289> health<00:00:52.469> restore<00:00:52.800> because<00:00:53.280> energy

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
in the health restore because energy

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:54.889 
in the health restore because energy
will<00:00:53.820> typically<00:00:54.149> be<00:00:54.390> the<00:00:54.420> thing<00:00:54.690> that<00:00:54.840> will

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
will typically be the thing that will

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.569 
will typically be the thing that will
keep<00:00:55.050> you<00:00:55.199> alive<00:00:55.230> just<00:00:55.410> because<00:00:55.949> abilities

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
keep you alive just because abilities

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.910 
keep you alive just because abilities
you<00:00:57.030> know<00:00:57.149> whether<00:00:57.570> it's<00:00:57.809> applying<00:00:58.199> a<00:00:58.350> cc<00:00:58.739> with

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
you know whether it's applying a cc with

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.830 
you know whether it's applying a cc with
a<00:00:58.949> radio<00:00:59.219> blind<00:00:59.460> or<00:00:59.579> whatever<00:00:59.879> it'll<00:01:00.420> just<00:01:00.629> you

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
a radio blind or whatever it'll just you

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.450 
a radio blind or whatever it'll just you
know<00:01:00.930> get<00:01:01.260> you<00:01:01.379> out<00:01:01.559> of<00:01:01.649> a<00:01:01.710> situation<00:01:01.920> in<00:01:02.340> a

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
know get you out of a situation in a

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.189 
know get you out of a situation in a
pinch<00:01:02.760> and<00:01:03.030> you<00:01:03.239> get<00:01:03.359> way<00:01:03.510> more<00:01:03.539> value<00:01:04.019> that

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
pinch and you get way more value that

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.020 
pinch and you get way more value that
way<00:01:04.409> some<00:01:04.949> of<00:01:04.979> these<00:01:05.070> other<00:01:05.280> mods<00:01:05.580> though<00:01:05.820> are

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
way some of these other mods though are

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.550 
way some of these other mods though are
kind<00:01:06.299> of<00:01:06.420> an<00:01:06.540> underwhelming<00:01:06.869> in<00:01:07.140> my<00:01:07.260> opinion

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
kind of an underwhelming in my opinion

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.469 
kind of an underwhelming in my opinion
like<00:01:07.710> I<00:01:07.770> mean<00:01:07.979> this<00:01:08.100> one<00:01:08.369> for<00:01:08.700> 80%<00:01:09.000> fire<00:01:09.330> rate

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
like I mean this one for 80% fire rate

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.120 
like I mean this one for 80% fire rate
to<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:09.630> person<00:01:10.080> prime<00:01:10.320> I<00:01:10.350> mean<00:01:10.680> we'll<00:01:10.799> see<00:01:10.830> if

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
to the person prime I mean we'll see if

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.890 
to the person prime I mean we'll see if
that<00:01:11.250> will<00:01:11.369> do<00:01:11.490> anything<00:01:11.520> but<00:01:12.000> definitely<00:01:12.689> the

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
that will do anything but definitely the

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.499 
that will do anything but definitely the
blade<00:01:13.380> of<00:01:13.560> truth<00:01:13.970> hundreds<00:01:14.970> of<00:01:15.060> millions<00:01:15.450> are

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
blade of truth hundreds of millions are

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.179 
blade of truth hundreds of millions are
the<00:01:15.570> Joss<00:01:15.810> or<00:01:16.049> the<00:01:16.140> Djoser<00:01:16.409> is<00:01:16.500> terrible<00:01:16.979> so

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
the Joss or the Djoser is terrible so

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:18.859 
the Joss or the Djoser is terrible so
it's<00:01:17.460> not<00:01:17.549> really<00:01:17.759> worth<00:01:17.939> it<00:01:18.180> and<00:01:18.299> then<00:01:18.420> the<00:01:18.600> 4%

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
it's not really worth it and then the 4%

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.450 
it's not really worth it and then the 4%
magazine<00:01:19.409> the<00:01:19.500> VIPRE<00:01:19.740> is<00:01:19.950> kind<00:01:20.159> of<00:01:20.220> whatever

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
magazine the VIPRE is kind of whatever

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.789 
magazine the VIPRE is kind of whatever
but<00:01:21.180> the<00:01:21.330> next<00:01:21.600> one<00:01:21.750> that<00:01:21.780> my<00:01:22.049> ion<00:01:22.350> is<00:01:22.530> very

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
but the next one that my ion is very

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.190 
but the next one that my ion is very
here<00:01:23.070> the<00:01:23.250> smoke<00:01:23.580> shadow<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.780> ability<00:01:25.170> to

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
here the smoke shadow the ability to

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.260 
here the smoke shadow the ability to
make<00:01:25.590> your<00:01:25.770> allies<00:01:26.189> invisible<00:01:26.640> as<00:01:26.820> well<00:01:27.090> with

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
make your allies invisible as well with

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:28.969 
make your allies invisible as well with
your<00:01:27.360> smoke<00:01:27.600> screen<00:01:27.869> seems<00:01:28.229> really<00:01:28.740> really

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
your smoke screen seems really really

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.920 
your smoke screen seems really really
good<00:01:29.189> I<00:01:29.400> mean<00:01:29.670> it<00:01:29.909> says<00:01:30.090> for<00:01:30.270> a<00:01:30.299> short<00:01:30.540> time<00:01:30.750> so

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
good I mean it says for a short time so

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.480 
good I mean it says for a short time so
we'll<00:01:31.049> see<00:01:31.200> how<00:01:31.350> long<00:01:31.500> it<00:01:31.650> lasts<00:01:31.890> but<00:01:32.130> still

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
we'll see how long it lasts but still

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.670 
we'll see how long it lasts but still
that<00:01:32.939> seems<00:01:33.210> like<00:01:33.329> a<00:01:33.360> high-value<00:01:33.840> mod<00:01:34.439> right

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
that seems like a high-value mod right

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.710 
that seems like a high-value mod right
there<00:01:34.890> and<00:01:35.159> then<00:01:35.280> the<00:01:35.369> next<00:01:35.670> one<00:01:35.820> this<00:01:36.329> hall<00:01:36.689> of

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
there and then the next one this hall of

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.260 
there and then the next one this hall of
malevolence<00:01:37.409> seems<00:01:37.710> really<00:01:38.400> strong<00:01:38.700> like<00:01:39.030> it

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
malevolence seems really strong like it

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.330 
malevolence seems really strong like it
says<00:01:39.780> the<00:01:40.170> damage<00:01:40.439> of<00:01:40.590> your<00:01:40.619> double<00:01:40.920> gamma<00:01:41.070> is

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
says the damage of your double gamma is

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.399 
says the damage of your double gamma is
increase<00:01:41.880> every<00:01:42.299> time<00:01:42.479> you<00:01:42.630> kill<00:01:42.869> an<00:01:43.020> enemy<00:01:43.140> so

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
increase every time you kill an enemy so

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:44.870 
increase every time you kill an enemy so
depending<00:01:43.770> on<00:01:43.829> how<00:01:43.979> much<00:01:44.189> that<00:01:44.399> scales<00:01:44.700> up

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
depending on how much that scales up

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.190 
depending on how much that scales up
that<00:01:45.090> could<00:01:45.240> be<00:01:45.360> like<00:01:45.509> stupidly<00:01:46.110> overpowered

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
that could be like stupidly overpowered

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.460 
that could be like stupidly overpowered
and<00:01:46.979> I<00:01:47.220> can't<00:01:47.430> wait<00:01:47.549> to<00:01:47.640> get<00:01:47.729> my<00:01:47.880> hands<00:01:48.119> on<00:01:48.360> that

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:48.470 
and I can't wait to get my hands on that

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:51.200 
and I can't wait to get my hands on that
so<00:01:49.470> that's<00:01:49.829> kind<00:01:50.280> of<00:01:50.369> mods<00:01:50.610> that<00:01:50.790> stick<00:01:51.060> out

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
so that's kind of mods that stick out

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.410 
so that's kind of mods that stick out
for<00:01:51.540> me<00:01:51.750> the<00:01:52.259> other<00:01:52.290> good<00:01:52.560> thing<00:01:52.680> about<00:01:52.710> this

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
or with the Cephalon pseudo which is the

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:59.899 
or with the Cephalon pseudo which is the
next<00:01:58.590> one<00:01:58.829> that's<00:01:58.979> thinking<00:01:59.369> of<00:01:59.460> actually

Spectre<00:02:06.329> which<00:02:06.450> will<00:02:06.810> be<00:02:06.990> kind<00:02:07.229> of<00:02:07.290> neat<00:02:07.469> to

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
Spectre which will be kind of neat to

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:08.930 
Spectre which will be kind of neat to
just<00:02:07.649> have<00:02:07.920> like<00:02:08.069> a<00:02:08.160> shield<00:02:08.340> osprey<00:02:08.700> Foley

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
to kind of experiment with so that works

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:40.760 
to kind of experiment with so that works
out<00:02:39.120> really<00:02:39.180> well<00:02:39.420> the<00:02:40.050> the<00:02:40.320> font<00:02:40.500> thing<00:02:40.650> I'll

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:40.770 
out really well the the font thing I'll

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:42.830 
out really well the the font thing I'll
say<00:02:40.800> -<00:02:40.980> is<00:02:41.400> that<00:02:41.700> your<00:02:41.850> enemies<00:02:42.300> is<00:02:42.480> the<00:02:42.510> course

going to be the red veil and the Piron

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.930 
going to be the red veil and the Piron
sequence<00:02:46.110> which<00:02:46.620> again<00:02:47.250> like<00:02:47.490> these<00:02:47.640> ones

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
sequence which again like these ones

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:49.580 
sequence which again like these ones
seem<00:02:48.210> definitely<00:02:48.840> underwhelming<00:02:49.440> in

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
seem definitely underwhelming in

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.270 
seem definitely underwhelming in
comparison<00:02:50.870> like<00:02:51.870> basically<00:02:52.290> being<00:02:53.040> at<00:02:53.160> E

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
comparison like basically being at E

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.280 
comparison like basically being at E
Force<00:02:53.520> exterminate<00:02:54.480> could<00:02:54.690> be<00:02:54.810> pretty<00:02:55.050> good

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
Force exterminate could be pretty good

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.050 
Force exterminate could be pretty good
but<00:02:55.500> some<00:02:55.620> of<00:02:55.710> these<00:02:55.770> mods<00:02:56.070> like<00:02:56.370> the<00:02:56.850> stalks

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
but some of these mods like the stalks

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.690 
but some of these mods like the stalks
of<00:02:57.210> light<00:02:57.420> for<00:02:57.660> the<00:02:57.750> mire<00:02:57.990> I<00:02:58.680> don't<00:02:59.520> know<00:02:59.580> the

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
of light for the mire I don't know the

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.100 
of light for the mire I don't know the
embolus<00:03:00.150> here<00:03:00.390> which<00:03:00.570> may<00:03:00.720> or<00:03:00.810> may<00:03:00.900> not<00:03:00.990> be

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
embolus here which may or may not be

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:02.480 
embolus here which may or may not be
good<00:03:01.200> the<00:03:01.350> dark<00:03:01.530> daggers<00:03:01.860> kind<00:03:02.070> of<00:03:02.130> whatever

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:02.490

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
and then you got the fireball frenzy and

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:05.780 
and then you got the fireball frenzy and
a<00:03:04.530> venom<00:03:04.770> to<00:03:04.860> it<00:03:04.950> like<00:03:05.040> some<00:03:05.220> of<00:03:05.250> these<00:03:05.400> skills

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
a venom to it like some of these skills

a venom to it like some of these skills
just<00:03:06.030> don't<00:03:06.330> really<00:03:06.510> seem<00:03:06.810> to<00:03:06.960> compare<00:03:07.440> again

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
just don't really seem to compare again

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.420 
just don't really seem to compare again
in<00:03:08.580> terms<00:03:08.820> of<00:03:08.970> the<00:03:09.030> hexes<00:03:09.450> one<00:03:09.770> so<00:03:10.770> I<00:03:11.100> mean

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
in terms of the hexes one so I mean

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:12.980 
in terms of the hexes one so I mean
that's<00:03:11.640> kind<00:03:11.970> of<00:03:12.000> that<00:03:12.060> but<00:03:12.420> the<00:03:12.540> other<00:03:12.720> cool

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:12.990 
that's kind of that but the other cool

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:15.110 
that's kind of that but the other cool
