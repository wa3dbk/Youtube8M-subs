in the wallet and it attaches like this

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.660 
in the wallet and it attaches like this
to<00:00:53.219> the<00:00:53.339> flash<00:00:54.170> all<00:00:55.170> right<00:00:55.319> you'll<00:00:55.979> notice<00:00:56.249> the

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
to the flash all right you'll notice the

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.000 
to the flash all right you'll notice the
it<00:00:57.089> fits<00:00:57.449> at<00:00:57.690> a<00:00:57.719> 45<00:00:58.199> degree<00:00:58.379> angle<00:00:58.530> so<00:00:58.889> the

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
it fits at a 45 degree angle so the

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.950 
it fits at a 45 degree angle so the
light<00:00:59.190> goes<00:00:59.399> either<00:00:59.639> through<00:01:00.120> the<00:01:00.269> holes<00:01:00.539> like

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
light goes either through the holes like

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.899 
light goes either through the holes like
this<00:01:01.199> to<00:01:01.469> bounce<00:01:01.649> off<00:01:01.889> the<00:01:02.010> ceiling<00:01:02.190> or

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:02.909 
this to bounce off the ceiling or

00:01:02.909 --> 00:01:05.210 
this to bounce off the ceiling or
bounces<00:01:03.329> off<00:01:03.479> the<00:01:03.510> device<00:01:03.839> going<00:01:04.199> forward<00:01:04.739> to

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
bounces off the device going forward to

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.590 
bounces off the device going forward to
fill<00:01:05.430> the<00:01:05.549> shadows<00:01:05.940> that<00:01:06.060> are<00:01:06.180> cast<00:01:06.360> by<00:01:06.479> the

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
fill the shadows that are cast by the

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.960 
fill the shadows that are cast by the
ceiling<00:01:06.990> mounts<00:01:07.290> it's<00:01:07.950> important<00:01:08.460> that<00:01:08.490> it's

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
ceiling mounts it's important that it's

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.210 
ceiling mounts it's important that it's
fitted<00:01:09.300> on<00:01:09.420> that<00:01:09.570> 45<00:01:10.020> degree<00:01:10.320> angles<00:01:10.710> because

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
fitted on that 45 degree angles because

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.620 
fitted on that 45 degree angles because
obviously<00:01:11.430> if<00:01:11.790> it's<00:01:11.940> at<00:01:12.090> the<00:01:12.210> wrong<00:01:12.360> angle

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
obviously if it's at the wrong angle

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:13.940 
obviously if it's at the wrong angle
sending<00:01:13.170> light<00:01:13.380> in<00:01:13.500> a<00:01:13.530> different<00:01:13.680> direction

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
sending light in a different direction

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.470 
sending light in a different direction
you're<00:01:14.430> going<00:01:14.460> to<00:01:14.670> be<00:01:14.790> wasting<00:01:15.150> a<00:01:15.240> lot<00:01:15.390> of

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:15.480 
you're going to be wasting a lot of

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:17.330 
you're going to be wasting a lot of
light<00:01:15.660> so<00:01:15.930> this<00:01:16.320> is<00:01:16.500> redirecting<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.220> light

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
light so this is redirecting the light

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.190 
light so this is redirecting the light
forward<00:01:17.730> and<00:01:17.880> to<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:18.330> ceiling<00:01:18.690> so<00:01:19.170> the

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
forward and to the ceiling so the

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.050 
forward and to the ceiling so the
ceiling<00:01:19.560> becomes<00:01:19.830> the<00:01:20.130> primary<00:01:20.400> light<00:01:20.790> source

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
ceiling becomes the primary light source

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.730 
ceiling becomes the primary light source
and<00:01:21.420> a<00:01:21.480> much<00:01:21.660> larger<00:01:22.110> light<00:01:22.260> source<00:01:22.530> coming

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
and a much larger light source coming

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.160 
and a much larger light source coming
from<00:01:22.920> a<00:01:23.070> more<00:01:23.280> natural<00:01:23.670> direction<00:01:24.120> and<00:01:24.360> the

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
from a more natural direction and the

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.190 
from a more natural direction and the
pro<00:01:25.350> Mac<00:01:25.530> system<00:01:25.950> though<00:01:26.330> it<00:01:27.330> also<00:01:27.510> comes<00:01:27.930> with

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
pro Mac system though it also comes with

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.930 
pro Mac system though it also comes with
gold<00:01:28.680> silver<00:01:29.100> and<00:01:29.220> white<00:01:29.340> inserts

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:29.940 
gold silver and white inserts

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:31.430 
gold silver and white inserts
so<00:01:30.330> let's<00:01:30.510> say<00:01:30.630> you're<00:01:30.750> in<00:01:30.840> a<00:01:30.900> situation<00:01:30.930> where

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:31.440 
so let's say you're in a situation where

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.200 
so let's say you're in a situation where
you<00:01:31.650> don't<00:01:31.860> have<00:01:32.010> a<00:01:32.070> low<00:01:32.400> an<00:01:32.610> 8<00:01:32.730> or<00:01:32.880> 9-foot

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
you don't have a low an 8 or 9-foot

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.630 
you don't have a low an 8 or 9-foot
neutral<00:01:33.630> ceiling<00:01:34.020> you<00:01:34.980> can<00:01:35.100> put<00:01:35.310> say<00:01:35.490> the

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
neutral ceiling you can put say the

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.910 
neutral ceiling you can put say the
white<00:01:35.850> insert<00:01:36.270> in<00:01:36.420> here<00:01:36.660> which<00:01:37.410> essentially

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
white insert in here which essentially
