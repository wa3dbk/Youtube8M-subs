00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
day and I saw this conductivity light I

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.310 
day and I saw this conductivity light I
was<00:00:10.590> I'm<00:00:10.769> excited<00:00:11.280> because<00:00:11.519> of<00:00:12.120> the<00:00:12.320> potential

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
was I'm excited because of the potential

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.890 
was I'm excited because of the potential
of<00:00:13.530> what<00:00:13.889> you<00:00:14.250> could<00:00:14.490> do<00:00:14.730> with<00:00:14.940> this<00:00:15.120> just<00:00:15.509> from

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
of what you could do with this just from

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.410 
of what you could do with this just from
watching<00:00:16.170> his<00:00:16.560> video<00:00:16.980> so<00:00:17.670> I<00:00:17.699> called<00:00:18.000> up<00:00:18.150> one<00:00:18.300> of

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
watching his video so I called up one of

actually<00:00:44.480> being<00:00:45.480> a<00:00:45.690> scientist<00:00:46.469> and

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
actually being a scientist and

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.889 
actually being a scientist and
experimented<00:00:47.399> that<00:00:47.430> he<00:00:47.670> is<00:00:47.820> so<00:00:48.480> that<00:00:48.629> we<00:00:48.750> can

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
experimented that he is so that we can

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.670 
experimented that he is so that we can
all<00:00:49.399> do<00:00:50.399> our<00:00:50.430> own<00:00:50.600> experimenting<00:00:51.600> and<00:00:51.780> grow<00:00:52.320> as

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
all do our own experimenting and grow as

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:59.840 
all do our own experimenting and grow as
a<00:00:53.160> community<00:00:55.579> so<00:00:56.579> let's<00:00:57.329> get<00:00:57.510> started<00:00:58.050> so<00:00:58.850> all

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
a community so let's get started so all

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.229 
a community so let's get started so all
we<00:00:59.940> need<00:01:00.090> to<00:01:00.210> do<00:01:00.329> is<00:01:00.480> hit<00:01:00.629> the<00:01:00.809> switch<00:01:02.090> plug<00:01:03.090> the

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
we need to do is hit the switch plug the

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.969 
we need to do is hit the switch plug the
wires<00:01:03.449> in<00:01:03.830> and<00:01:05.540> our<00:01:06.540> probe<00:01:06.869> is<00:01:07.170> right<00:01:07.409> here<00:01:07.619> and

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
wires in and our probe is right here and

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.980 
wires in and our probe is right here and
we'll<00:01:08.189> use<00:01:08.220> that<00:01:08.460> liquids<00:01:09.150> and<00:01:09.330> fruits<00:01:09.780> and

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
we'll use that liquids and fruits and

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.480 
we'll use that liquids and fruits and
vegetables<00:01:10.439> you<00:01:10.530> feel<00:01:10.799> that<00:01:11.010> works<00:01:11.220> in<00:01:11.430> a

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
vegetables you feel that works in a

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:18.440 
vegetables you feel that works in a
minute<00:01:15.890> plug<00:01:16.890> it<00:01:17.040> in<00:01:17.189> and<00:01:17.430> we're<00:01:18.060> ready<00:01:18.240> to

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
minute plug it in and we're ready to

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.770 
minute plug it in and we're ready to
start<00:01:18.720> with<00:01:19.590> our<00:01:19.799> water<00:01:20.640> test<00:01:21.060> our<00:01:21.299> very<00:01:21.509> first

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
start with our water test our very first

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.380 
start with our water test our very first
test<00:01:22.049> we're<00:01:22.259> testing<00:01:22.619> in<00:01:22.710> water<00:01:23.180> so<00:01:24.180> that

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
test we're testing in water so that

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.749 
test we're testing in water so that
first<00:01:24.630> test<00:01:24.869> of<00:01:24.990> water<00:01:25.259> is<00:01:25.590> going<00:01:25.950> to<00:01:26.040> be<00:01:26.280> tap

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
first test of water is going to be tap

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.880 
first test of water is going to be tap
water<00:01:27.119> and<00:01:27.750> we're<00:01:27.840> just<00:01:27.960> filming<00:01:28.290> it<00:01:28.619> so<00:01:28.650> you

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
water and we're just filming it so you

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.609 
water and we're just filming it so you
can<00:01:29.100> see<00:01:29.280> that<00:01:29.460> it<00:01:29.610> really<00:01:29.790> is<00:01:29.970> tap<00:01:30.509> water<00:01:30.810> we

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
can see that it really is tap water we

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.609 
can see that it really is tap water we
have<00:01:31.740> blue<00:01:32.009> tape<00:01:32.280> on<00:01:32.549> the<00:01:32.820> glass<00:01:33.060> so<00:01:33.540> no<00:01:34.380> matter

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
have blue tape on the glass so no matter

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.319 
have blue tape on the glass so no matter
where<00:01:34.890> it<00:01:35.009> is<00:01:35.040> on<00:01:35.189> the<00:01:35.400> table<00:01:35.670> or<00:01:35.939> anything<00:01:36.090> you

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
where it is on the table or anything you

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.800 
where it is on the table or anything you
know<00:01:36.450> that<00:01:36.479> that<00:01:36.869> is<00:01:37.200> tap<00:01:37.619> water<00:01:38.689> so<00:01:39.689> we'll

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
know that that is tap water so we'll

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.450 
know that that is tap water so we'll
take<00:01:39.960> that<00:01:40.110> over<00:01:40.409> to<00:01:40.439> set<00:01:40.740> it<00:01:40.860> on<00:01:40.979> the<00:01:41.070> table<00:01:43.460> so

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
take that over to set it on the table so

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.429 
take that over to set it on the table so
here<00:01:44.640> we<00:01:44.759> are<00:01:44.790> now<00:01:45.290> with<00:01:46.290> the<00:01:47.100> tap<00:01:47.460> water<00:01:48.439> and

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
here we are now with the tap water and

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:53.480 
here we are now with the tap water and
we're<00:01:49.590> going<00:01:49.680> to<00:01:49.740> take<00:01:49.920> some<00:01:50.100> 9.5<00:01:52.159> pH<00:01:53.159> water

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
we're going to take some 9.5 pH water

00:01:53.490 --> 00:02:02.240 
we're going to take some 9.5 pH water
pour<00:01:54.420> it<00:01:54.689> in<00:01:54.810> the<00:01:54.930> other<00:01:55.049> glass<00:02:00.229> and<00:02:01.250> we're

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
pour it in the other glass and we're

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:07.399 
pour it in the other glass and we're
ready<00:02:02.549> to<00:02:02.790> start<00:02:03.180> the<00:02:03.360> experiment<00:02:03.719> just<00:02:06.409> turn

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
ready to start the experiment just turn

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:12.380 
ready to start the experiment just turn
on<00:02:07.590> the<00:02:07.740> switch<00:02:08.039> and<00:02:10.129> the<00:02:11.129> end<00:02:11.550> of<00:02:11.910> that<00:02:12.030> probe

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
on the switch and the end of that probe

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.730 
on the switch and the end of that probe
will<00:02:12.750> have<00:02:12.900> 110

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
will have 110

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:18.080 
will have 110
bolts<00:02:13.980> right<00:02:14.550> at<00:02:14.760> the<00:02:14.940> end<00:02:15.090> of<00:02:15.240> the<00:02:15.390> probe<00:02:17.090> and

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
bolts right at the end of the probe and

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.320 
bolts right at the end of the probe and
we'll<00:02:18.630> put<00:02:18.810> it<00:02:18.900> in<00:02:19.140> the<00:02:19.430> tap<00:02:20.430> water<00:02:20.610> first<00:02:20.970> so

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
we'll put it in the tap water first so

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.010 
we'll put it in the tap water first so
you<00:02:21.960> can<00:02:22.110> see<00:02:22.320> what<00:02:22.470> happens<00:02:22.860> and<00:02:24.020> nothing

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
you can see what happens and nothing

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.680 
you can see what happens and nothing
happens<00:02:25.580> there's<00:02:26.580> not<00:02:26.820> even<00:02:26.850> enough<00:02:27.240> in<00:02:27.660> that

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
happens there's not even enough in that

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:31.790 
happens there's not even enough in that
water<00:02:28.170> to<00:02:28.500> excite<00:02:29.100> that<00:02:30.470> enough<00:02:31.470> to<00:02:31.620> light

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
water to excite that enough to light

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.700 
water to excite that enough to light
that<00:02:31.980> light<00:02:32.160> bulb<00:02:32.780> and<00:02:33.780> in<00:02:34.110> the<00:02:34.200> pH<00:02:34.470> balance

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:34.710 
that light bulb and in the pH balance

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:38.180 
that light bulb and in the pH balance
water<00:02:35.160> nine<00:02:36.030> point<00:02:36.330> five<00:02:36.650> nothing<00:02:37.650> happens

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
water nine point five nothing happens

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:41.480 
water nine point five nothing happens
over<00:02:38.400> there<00:02:38.550> either<00:02:38.850> so<00:02:39.890> we're<00:02:40.890> gonna<00:02:40.980> give<00:02:41.370> it

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:41.490 
over there either so we're gonna give it

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:44.570 
over there either so we're gonna give it
a<00:02:41.550> little<00:02:42.080> shot<00:02:43.080> in<00:02:43.140> the<00:02:43.260> arm<00:02:43.320> see<00:02:44.130> what<00:02:44.280> we<00:02:44.400> can

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
a little shot in the arm see what we can

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:47.960 
a little shot in the arm see what we can
get<00:02:44.700> going<00:02:45.060> and<00:02:45.930> we're<00:02:46.860> gonna<00:02:47.010> first<00:02:47.640> in<00:02:47.850> the

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
get going and we're gonna first in the

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:52.370 
get going and we're gonna first in the
tap<00:02:48.150> water<00:02:48.180> we<00:02:48.600> use<00:02:48.720> iodized<00:02:49.350> salt<00:02:51.290> just<00:02:52.290> a

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
tap water we use iodized salt just a

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:55.460 
tap water we use iodized salt just a
little<00:02:52.680> tiny<00:02:52.830> bit<00:02:53.040> of<00:02:53.100> this<00:02:53.250> will<00:02:53.460> help<00:02:54.470> look

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
little tiny bit of this will help look

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:58.580 
little tiny bit of this will help look
at<00:02:55.620> that<00:02:55.860> it's<00:02:56.520> not<00:02:56.670> beautiful<00:02:56.850> so<00:02:57.590> the

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
at that it's not beautiful so the

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:05.840 
at that it's not beautiful so the
conductivity<00:02:59.100> of<00:02:59.520> that<00:03:00.360> now<00:03:01.110> is<00:03:02.010> ready<00:03:02.630> to<00:03:04.850> for

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:05.850 
conductivity of that now is ready to for

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:08.300 
conductivity of that now is ready to for
the<00:03:05.970> next<00:03:06.540> part<00:03:06.720> of<00:03:06.780> the<00:03:06.900> experiment<00:03:07.470> except

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
the next part of the experiment except

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:17.260 
the next part of the experiment except
we're<00:03:08.430> going<00:03:08.460> to<00:03:08.700> do<00:03:08.790> the<00:03:08.940> pH<00:03:09.240> balance<00:03:09.800> first

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:17.270 

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:20.150 

and<00:03:18.270> then<00:03:18.510> the<00:03:18.630> pH<00:03:18.870> balance<00:03:19.290> water<00:03:19.770> we're

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
and then the pH balance water we're

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:26.480 
and then the pH balance water we're
going<00:03:20.310> to<00:03:20.370> use<00:03:20.550> Himalayan<00:03:21.590> crystal<00:03:22.590> salt<00:03:25.490> now

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:26.490 
going to use Himalayan crystal salt now

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:28.700 
going to use Himalayan crystal salt now
if<00:03:26.610> you've<00:03:26.760> never<00:03:26.790> had<00:03:27.240> Himalayan<00:03:28.200> crystal

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:28.710 
if you've never had Himalayan crystal

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:32.390 
if you've never had Himalayan crystal
salt<00:03:29.120> it's<00:03:30.120> much<00:03:30.450> saltier<00:03:31.200> than<00:03:31.530> iodized<00:03:32.370> salt

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
salt it's much saltier than iodized salt

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.810 
salt it's much saltier than iodized salt
you<00:03:33.300> need<00:03:33.510> just<00:03:34.080> a<00:03:34.260> little<00:03:34.290> tiny<00:03:34.830> bit<00:03:35.130> of<00:03:35.160> it<00:03:35.370> if

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:35.820 
you need just a little tiny bit of it if

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:39.020 
you need just a little tiny bit of it if
you<00:03:36.000> use<00:03:36.180> any<00:03:36.390> on<00:03:36.570> your<00:03:36.720> food<00:03:37.160> as<00:03:38.160> compared<00:03:38.730> to

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
you use any on your food as compared to

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:43.190 
you use any on your food as compared to
the<00:03:39.780> iodized<00:03:40.230> salt<00:03:40.260> but<00:03:40.800> watch<00:03:40.980> this<00:03:42.080> just<00:03:43.080> a

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
the iodized salt but watch this just a

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:44.990 
the iodized salt but watch this just a
few<00:03:43.380> little<00:03:43.530> grains<00:03:43.920> and<00:03:44.340> I<00:03:44.640> think<00:03:44.820> it's<00:03:44.910> gonna

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
few little grains and I think it's gonna

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.620 
few little grains and I think it's gonna
go<00:03:45.180> crazy<00:03:45.510> how<00:03:45.990> bright<00:03:46.290> that<00:03:46.320> is

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:47.630 
go crazy how bright that is

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:52.370 
go crazy how bright that is
we'll<00:03:48.630> put<00:03:48.840> a<00:03:48.870> little<00:03:49.020> more<00:03:49.200> in<00:03:51.110> and<00:03:52.110> it<00:03:52.200> gets

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:52.380 
we'll put a little more in and it gets

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:58.270 
we'll put a little more in and it gets
even<00:03:52.560> brighter

00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:58.280 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:00.869 

you

00:04:00.869 --> 00:04:00.879 

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:02.849 

now<00:04:01.450> we're<00:04:01.569> going<00:04:01.689> to<00:04:01.749> put<00:04:01.900> the<00:04:01.989> probe<00:04:02.230> back<00:04:02.530> in

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:02.859 
now we're going to put the probe back in

00:04:02.859 --> 00:04:07.470 
now we're going to put the probe back in
the<00:04:03.670> tap<00:04:04.150> water<00:04:05.040> and<00:04:06.040> I<00:04:06.879> think<00:04:07.120> I'm<00:04:07.209> gonna<00:04:07.359> put

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:07.480 
the tap water and I think I'm gonna put

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:12.660 
the tap water and I think I'm gonna put
a<00:04:07.510> little<00:04:07.629> more<00:04:07.749> salt<00:04:08.079> in<00:04:11.129> because<00:04:12.129> that<00:04:12.310> bulb

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:12.670 
a little more salt in because that bulb

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:14.369 
a little more salt in because that bulb
could<00:04:13.030> be<00:04:13.180> a<00:04:13.209> little<00:04:13.450> bit<00:04:13.629> brighter<00:04:13.840> even<00:04:14.170> with

00:04:14.369 --> 00:04:14.379 
could be a little bit brighter even with

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:20.360 
could be a little bit brighter even with
the<00:04:14.499> iodized<00:04:18.209> you<00:04:19.209> so<00:04:19.359> much<00:04:19.509> party<00:04:19.780> that<00:04:19.870> I<00:04:19.900> got

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.370 
the iodized you so much party that I got

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:25.230 
the iodized you so much party that I got
okay<00:04:21.370> now<00:04:22.030> what<00:04:22.780> we're<00:04:22.960> gonna<00:04:23.080> do<00:04:23.849> is<00:04:24.849> we're

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:25.240 
okay now what we're gonna do is we're

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:28.770 
okay now what we're gonna do is we're
gonna<00:04:25.330> take<00:04:25.660> sugar<00:04:27.300> and<00:04:28.300> we're<00:04:28.449> going<00:04:28.570> to<00:04:28.599> put

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:28.780 
gonna take sugar and we're going to put

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:32.730 
gonna take sugar and we're going to put
sugar<00:04:29.070> in<00:04:30.070> with<00:04:31.060> the<00:04:31.180> tap<00:04:31.419> water<00:04:31.750> because<00:04:32.530> you

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:32.740 
sugar in with the tap water because you

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:35.100 
sugar in with the tap water because you
can<00:04:32.860> see<00:04:33.009> the<00:04:33.130> conductivity<00:04:33.639> is<00:04:34.060> really<00:04:34.900> high

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:35.110 
can see the conductivity is really high

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:37.950 
can see the conductivity is really high
right<00:04:35.470> there<00:04:35.710> and<00:04:35.919> watch<00:04:36.520> what<00:04:36.729> happens<00:04:36.960> when

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:37.960 
right there and watch what happens when

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:41.760 
right there and watch what happens when
I<00:04:37.990> do<00:04:38.139> this<00:04:38.470> now<00:04:39.210> think<00:04:40.210> of<00:04:40.330> the<00:04:40.900> water<00:04:41.199> as<00:04:41.530> your

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:41.770 
I do this now think of the water as your

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:43.920 
I do this now think of the water as your
stomach<00:04:42.220> and<00:04:42.400> the<00:04:42.940> light<00:04:43.150> bulb<00:04:43.419> as<00:04:43.630> your

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:43.930 
stomach and the light bulb as your

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:47.249 
stomach and the light bulb as your
electrical<00:04:44.470> system<00:04:44.919> and<00:04:45.389> then<00:04:46.389> you<00:04:46.570> have<00:04:47.199> a

00:04:47.249 --> 00:04:47.259 
electrical system and then you have a

00:04:47.259 --> 00:04:50.909 
electrical system and then you have a
soda<00:04:47.650> or<00:04:47.949> a<00:04:48.009> candy<00:04:48.610> bar<00:04:48.810> look<00:04:49.810> how<00:04:49.990> much

00:04:50.909 --> 00:04:50.919 
soda or a candy bar look how much

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:53.159 
soda or a candy bar look how much
electricity<00:04:51.340> how<00:04:52.000> much<00:04:52.150> conductivity<00:04:52.750> that

00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:53.169 
electricity how much conductivity that

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:55.920 
electricity how much conductivity that
that<00:04:53.349> is<00:04:53.500> actually<00:04:53.710> shutting<00:04:54.370> down<00:04:54.610> I<00:04:54.940> find

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:55.930 
that is actually shutting down I find

00:04:55.930 --> 00:05:01.080 
that is actually shutting down I find
that<00:04:56.110> absolutely<00:04:56.259> amazing<00:04:57.870> and<00:04:59.940> you<00:05:00.940> may

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:01.090 
that absolutely amazing and you may

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:02.820 
that absolutely amazing and you may
think<00:05:01.120> I'm<00:05:01.509> putting<00:05:01.720> a<00:05:01.870> lot<00:05:01.990> of<00:05:02.050> sugar<00:05:02.349> in<00:05:02.470> but

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:02.830 
think I'm putting a lot of sugar in but

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:08.460 
think I'm putting a lot of sugar in but
you<00:05:02.979> could<00:05:03.160> get<00:05:03.340> 8<00:05:03.550> to<00:05:03.759> 10<00:05:07.110> teaspoons<00:05:08.110> of<00:05:08.289> sugar

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:08.470 
you could get 8 to 10 teaspoons of sugar

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:12.210 
you could get 8 to 10 teaspoons of sugar
in<00:05:09.130> just<00:05:09.490> a<00:05:09.610> soda<00:05:10.740> so<00:05:11.740> then<00:05:11.860> if<00:05:11.949> you<00:05:12.039> have<00:05:12.190> a

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:12.220 
in just a soda so then if you have a

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:14.460 
in just a soda so then if you have a
soda<00:05:12.639> and<00:05:12.940> you<00:05:12.970> have<00:05:13.330> sweets<00:05:13.750> with<00:05:14.080> it<00:05:14.229> think

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:14.470 
soda and you have sweets with it think

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:15.960 
soda and you have sweets with it think
of<00:05:14.590> how<00:05:14.710> much<00:05:14.860> sugar<00:05:15.070> you're<00:05:15.340> getting<00:05:15.639> and<00:05:15.789> how

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:15.970 
of how much sugar you're getting and how

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:18.210 
of how much sugar you're getting and how
much<00:05:16.479> effect<00:05:16.630> you're<00:05:17.080> having<00:05:17.110> on<00:05:17.770> your<00:05:18.070> whole

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:18.220 
much effect you're having on your whole

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:20.850 
much effect you're having on your whole
electrical<00:05:18.820> system<00:05:19.199> you<00:05:20.199> can<00:05:20.380> see<00:05:20.620> each<00:05:20.830> time

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:20.860 
electrical system you can see each time

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:25.560 
electrical system you can see each time
I<00:05:21.280> put<00:05:21.520> that<00:05:21.699> in<00:05:22.560> that<00:05:23.669> it's<00:05:24.669> burning<00:05:25.210> it<00:05:25.300> off

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:25.570 
I put that in that it's burning it off

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:27.629 
I put that in that it's burning it off
and<00:05:25.900> it's<00:05:26.229> coming<00:05:26.620> back<00:05:26.860> or<00:05:27.159> what<00:05:27.280> that<00:05:27.460> the

00:05:27.629 --> 00:05:27.639 
and it's coming back or what that the

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:29.790 
and it's coming back or what that the
same<00:05:27.940> thing<00:05:28.180> is<00:05:28.300> happening<00:05:28.479> to<00:05:28.750> your<00:05:28.930> body<00:05:29.169> the

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:29.800 
same thing is happening to your body the

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:31.589 
same thing is happening to your body the
sugar<00:05:30.070> is<00:05:30.280> shutting<00:05:30.669> your<00:05:30.820> body<00:05:31.060> down<00:05:31.330> and

00:05:31.589 --> 00:05:31.599 
sugar is shutting your body down and

00:05:31.599 --> 00:05:34.860 
sugar is shutting your body down and
destroying<00:05:32.380> the<00:05:32.530> conductivity<00:05:33.130> of<00:05:33.630> your<00:05:34.630> body

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:34.870 
destroying the conductivity of your body

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:37.740 
destroying the conductivity of your body
then<00:05:35.680> as<00:05:36.009> it<00:05:36.370> starts<00:05:36.669> to<00:05:36.789> burn<00:05:36.940> it<00:05:37.150> off<00:05:37.270> it

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:37.750 
then as it starts to burn it off it

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:40.920 
then as it starts to burn it off it
starts<00:05:38.229> to<00:05:38.349> come<00:05:38.560> back<00:05:38.590> and<00:05:39.479> that<00:05:40.479> is<00:05:40.690> where

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:40.930 
starts to come back and that is where

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:45.060 
starts to come back and that is where
the<00:05:41.020> fatigue<00:05:41.409> comes<00:05:41.770> from<00:05:42.130> in<00:05:42.370> your<00:05:43.300> body<00:05:44.070> it's

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:45.070 
the fatigue comes from in your body it's

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:47.450 
the fatigue comes from in your body it's
fighting<00:05:45.580> the<00:05:45.759> acidity<00:05:46.270> and<00:05:46.509> the<00:05:46.599> sugars

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:47.460 
fighting the acidity and the sugars

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:50.760 
fighting the acidity and the sugars
trying<00:05:48.460> to<00:05:48.820> get<00:05:49.120> the<00:05:49.300> body<00:05:49.570> back<00:05:49.960> to<00:05:50.289> balance

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:50.770 
trying to get the body back to balance

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:57.050 
trying to get the body back to balance
into<00:05:51.520> an<00:05:51.639> alkaline<00:05:52.240> state<00:05:54.900> even<00:05:55.900> the

00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:57.060 
into an alkaline state even the

00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:00.240 
into an alkaline state even the
Himalayan<00:05:58.060> crystal<00:05:58.599> salt<00:05:58.800> you<00:05:59.800> can<00:05:59.979> see<00:06:00.159> it

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:00.250 
Himalayan crystal salt you can see it

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:03.839 
Himalayan crystal salt you can see it
recovers<00:06:00.699> a<00:06:00.729> lot<00:06:01.000> quicker<00:06:02.099> but<00:06:03.099> still<00:06:03.430> it<00:06:03.580> even

00:06:03.839 --> 00:06:03.849 
recovers a lot quicker but still it even

00:06:03.849 --> 00:06:06.029 
recovers a lot quicker but still it even
affects<00:06:04.210> that<00:06:04.449> that's<00:06:05.020> how<00:06:05.289> powerful<00:06:05.530> sugar

00:06:06.029 --> 00:06:06.039 
affects that that's how powerful sugar

00:06:06.039 --> 00:06:06.990 
affects that that's how powerful sugar
is<00:06:06.250> in<00:06:06.490> your<00:06:06.639> body

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:07.000 
is in your body

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.879 
is in your body
I<00:06:09.360> find<00:06:10.360> this<00:06:10.449> experiment<00:06:11.110> extremely<00:06:11.650> amazing

00:06:11.879 --> 00:06:11.889 
I find this experiment extremely amazing

00:06:11.889 --> 00:06:13.590 
I find this experiment extremely amazing
and<00:06:12.479> we

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:13.600 
and we

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:17.460 
and we
to<00:06:13.840> see<00:06:14.250> what<00:06:15.250> happens<00:06:15.430> to<00:06:15.790> our<00:06:15.940> bodies<00:06:16.470> when

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:17.470 
to see what happens to our bodies when

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:20.490 
to see what happens to our bodies when
we<00:06:17.740> are<00:06:18.090> drinking<00:06:19.090> alcohol

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:20.500 
we are drinking alcohol

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:25.380 
we are drinking alcohol
like<00:06:21.370> I<00:06:21.490> said<00:06:21.550> soda<00:06:22.860> sweets<00:06:24.270> anything<00:06:25.270> that

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:25.390 
like I said soda sweets anything that

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:29.130 
like I said soda sweets anything that
you<00:06:25.510> do<00:06:26.910> actually<00:06:27.990> interrupts<00:06:28.990> the

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:29.140 
you do actually interrupts the

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:35.640 
you do actually interrupts the
conductivity<00:06:29.770> of<00:06:30.220> your<00:06:30.970> entire<00:06:31.360> body<00:06:34.530> you<00:06:35.530> can

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:35.650 
conductivity of your entire body you can

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:37.800 
conductivity of your entire body you can
see<00:06:35.770> it<00:06:35.890> starting<00:06:36.130> to<00:06:36.160> come<00:06:36.310> back<00:06:36.660> it's<00:06:37.660> not

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:37.810 
see it starting to come back it's not

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:40.080 
see it starting to come back it's not
quite<00:06:38.350> as<00:06:38.530> bright<00:06:38.860> as<00:06:39.100> it<00:06:39.250> was<00:06:39.430> it<00:06:39.700> may<00:06:39.850> get

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:40.090 
quite as bright as it was it may get

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:44.570 
quite as bright as it was it may get
back<00:06:40.330> there<00:06:40.710> but<00:06:41.710> it<00:06:42.640> takes<00:06:42.850> a<00:06:43.000> while<00:06:43.210> so<00:06:43.930> I

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:44.580 
back there but it takes a while so I

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:48.150 
back there but it takes a while so I
hope<00:06:45.580> that<00:06:45.610> you<00:06:45.850> enjoyed<00:06:46.210> this<00:06:46.480> and<00:06:47.160> we'll

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:48.160 
hope that you enjoyed this and we'll

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:50.570 
hope that you enjoyed this and we'll
have<00:06:48.310> many<00:06:48.520> videos<00:06:49.030> coming<00:06:49.510> in<00:06:49.660> the<00:06:49.900> future
