our<00:00:06.480> new<00:00:06.690> burrito<00:00:07.049> 2.0<00:00:08.360> it's<00:00:09.360> basically

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
our new burrito 2.0 it's basically

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:17.080 
our new burrito 2.0 it's basically
defeasible<00:00:10.200> clock<00:00:14.059> pretty<00:00:15.059> much<00:00:15.330> it's<00:00:15.870> a<00:00:15.960> pop

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:17.090 
defeasible clock pretty much it's a pop

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:21.800 
defeasible clock pretty much it's a pop
we<00:00:18.090> use<00:00:18.210> it<00:00:18.359> for<00:00:18.390> our<00:00:18.660> ATX<00:00:19.170> events<00:00:20.600> there's<00:00:21.600> one

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
we use it for our ATX events there's one

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:28.009 
we use it for our ATX events there's one
coming<00:00:22.020> on<00:00:22.199> January<00:00:24.560> 29<00:00:25.560> I'm<00:00:26.099> assuming<00:00:27.019> we're

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
coming on January 29 I'm assuming we're

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.939 
coming on January 29 I'm assuming we're
gonna<00:00:28.140> be<00:00:29.720> using<00:00:30.720> this<00:00:31.050> one<00:00:31.289> we<00:00:31.529> used<00:00:31.800> it

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
gonna be using this one we used it

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.729 
gonna be using this one we used it
before<00:00:32.099> but<00:00:32.790> it<00:00:32.969> wasn't<00:00:33.329> as<00:00:33.530> realistic<00:00:34.530> or

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
before but it wasn't as realistic or

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.830 
before but it wasn't as realistic or
sophisticated<00:00:35.489> as<00:00:35.730> we<00:00:35.880> have<00:00:36.090> it<00:00:36.210> right<00:00:36.390> now

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
sophisticated as we have it right now

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.299 
sophisticated as we have it right now
I<00:00:36.870> do<00:00:37.800> have<00:00:38.899> wires<00:00:39.899> to<00:00:40.200> be<00:00:40.320> cut<00:00:40.559> which<00:00:40.920> is<00:00:41.100> any

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
I do have wires to be cut which is any

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.500 
I do have wires to be cut which is any
of<00:00:41.460> these<00:00:41.579> wires<00:00:41.910> will<00:00:42.840> diffuse<00:00:43.230> it<00:00:44.090> I'll<00:00:45.090> show

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
of these wires will diffuse it I'll show

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.299 
of these wires will diffuse it I'll show
you<00:00:45.570> guys<00:00:45.750> another<00:00:45.930> one<00:00:46.289> video<00:00:46.559> on<00:00:46.620> that<00:00:46.890> one<00:00:47.100> I

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
do have a Thunder be here there

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.869 
do have a Thunder be here there
something<00:00:52.500> to<00:00:52.620> be<00:00:52.649> in<00:00:52.829> here<00:00:53.070> just<00:00:53.309> to<00:00:53.430> shoot<00:00:53.730> it

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
something to be in here just to shoot it

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.380 
something to be in here just to shoot it
out<00:00:54.050> and<00:00:55.050> I<00:00:56.039> have<00:00:56.250> some<00:00:56.489> other<00:00:56.670> stuff<00:00:56.940> in<00:00:57.120> store

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
out and I have some other stuff in store

00:01:02.529 --> 00:01:02.539 
as well for it I do have a flash unit

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:06.260 
as well for it I do have a flash unit
which<00:01:03.539> is<00:01:03.750> right<00:01:04.019> here<00:01:04.939> it's<00:01:05.939> kind<00:01:06.150> of

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
which is right here it's kind of

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.210 
which is right here it's kind of
customizable<00:01:07.049> it<00:01:07.260> was<00:01:07.380> a<00:01:07.409> pain<00:01:07.799> in<00:01:07.950> the<00:01:07.979> butt

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
customizable it was a pain in the butt

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:14.020 
customizable it was a pain in the butt
but<00:01:08.460> it<00:01:09.240> works<00:01:09.420> good<00:01:10.460> here<00:01:11.460> let<00:01:11.640> me<00:01:11.670> show<00:01:11.729> you

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:14.030 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:24.429 

and<00:01:16.640> there<00:01:17.640> you<00:01:17.670> go<00:01:18.710> it's<00:01:20.990> it's<00:01:21.990> really<00:01:22.140> nice

00:01:24.429 --> 00:01:24.439 

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:28.940 

basically<00:01:25.439> you<00:01:25.590> have<00:01:25.860> to<00:01:26.009> cut<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.220> wires<00:01:27.950> let

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
basically you have to cut the wires let

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:38.179 
basically you have to cut the wires let
me<00:01:29.009> show<00:01:29.220> you<00:01:29.280> a<00:01:29.400> quick<00:01:29.750> look<00:01:30.750> 10<00:01:31.350> seconds<00:01:37.189> you

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
me show you a quick look 10 seconds you

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:41.060 
me show you a quick look 10 seconds you
can<00:01:38.340> see<00:01:38.369> it's<00:01:39.299> only<00:01:39.420> 10<00:01:39.750> seconds<00:01:40.170> right<00:01:40.890> now<00:01:40.950> I

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
can see it's only 10 seconds right now I

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.600 
can see it's only 10 seconds right now I
have<00:01:41.369> a<00:01:41.400> switch<00:01:41.850> off<00:01:42.590> which<00:01:43.590> there's<00:01:44.369> not<00:01:44.579> a

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
have a switch off which there's not a

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.880 
have a switch off which there's not a
lot<00:01:44.850> of<00:01:46.100> the<00:01:47.100> actual<00:01:47.579> mortar<00:01:48.149> to<00:01:48.600> start<00:01:49.439> so<00:01:49.799> the

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
lot of the actual mortar to start so the

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.910 
lot of the actual mortar to start so the
grenade<00:01:50.189> actually<00:01:50.610> will<00:01:50.729> go<00:01:50.850> off<00:01:51.649> just<00:01:52.649> see

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
grenade actually will go off just see

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.389 
grenade actually will go off just see
kind<00:01:53.340> of<00:01:53.820> less<00:01:54.030> safety<00:01:54.710> make<00:01:55.710> sure<00:01:55.860> it<00:01:55.950> doesn't

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
kind of less safety make sure it doesn't

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.789 
kind of less safety make sure it doesn't
go<00:01:56.490> off<00:01:56.640> by<00:01:56.909> accidental<00:01:57.600> once<00:01:58.020> you<00:01:58.320> open<00:01:58.710> the

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
go off by accidental once you open the

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.469 
go off by accidental once you open the
case<00:01:59.040> it<00:01:59.340> also<00:01:59.490> could<00:01:59.820> be<00:01:59.850> programmed<00:02:00.119> that

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
case it also could be programmed that

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.039 
case it also could be programmed that
once<00:02:00.689> you<00:02:00.840> open<00:02:01.079> the<00:02:01.170> case<00:02:01.409> it<00:02:02.630> you<00:02:03.630> won't<00:02:03.780> be

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
once you open the case it you won't be

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.020 
once you open the case it you won't be
it<00:02:04.350> will<00:02:04.500> start<00:02:04.770> the<00:02:04.890> time<00:02:05.100> depending<00:02:05.939> on

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
it will start the time depending on

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.889 
it will start the time depending on
whatever<00:02:06.210> time<00:02:06.540> you<00:02:06.659> want<00:02:08.330> we<00:02:09.330> also<00:02:09.509> added<00:02:09.750> an

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
whatever time you want we also added an

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.449 
whatever time you want we also added an
amplifier<00:02:10.379> because<00:02:10.649> the<00:02:10.770> sound<00:02:11.039> was<00:02:11.099> kind<00:02:11.370> of

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
amplifier because the sound was kind of

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:12.270 
amplifier because the sound was kind of
too<00:02:11.580> low

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
too low

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:15.840 
too low
and<00:02:13.020> you<00:02:14.020> have<00:02:14.200> eight<00:02:14.410> wires<00:02:14.650> to<00:02:14.920> decide<00:02:15.280> for<00:02:15.580> I

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:15.850 
and you have eight wires to decide for I

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:17.910 
and you have eight wires to decide for I
was<00:02:16.480> thinking<00:02:16.720> about<00:02:16.900> adding<00:02:17.230> more<00:02:17.260> stuff<00:02:17.680> but

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
was thinking about adding more stuff but

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.290 
was thinking about adding more stuff but
due<00:02:18.040> to<00:02:18.070> the<00:02:18.250> fact<00:02:18.280> they'll<00:02:18.640> use<00:02:18.790> it<00:02:18.820> this<00:02:19.060> for

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 
due to the fact they'll use it this for

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.390 
due to the fact they'll use it this for
events<00:02:19.810> I<00:02:19.960> don't<00:02:20.800> want<00:02:20.920> to<00:02:20.980> have<00:02:21.070> any<00:02:21.220> problems

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
events I don't want to have any problems

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.390 
events I don't want to have any problems
with<00:02:21.850> people<00:02:22.350> getting<00:02:23.350> shocked<00:02:23.770> or<00:02:24.040> something

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
with people getting shocked or something

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:29.460 
with people getting shocked or something
and<00:02:25.260> let<00:02:26.260> me<00:02:26.320> show<00:02:26.560> you<00:02:26.620> how<00:02:27.040> it<00:02:27.550> will<00:02:27.670> work<00:02:28.470> if

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
and let me show you how it will work if

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:32.610 
and let me show you how it will work if
you<00:02:29.890> didn't<00:02:30.310> disarmed<00:02:30.850> it<00:02:31.230> turn<00:02:32.230> the<00:02:32.410> switch

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
you didn't disarmed it turn the switch

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:38.580 
you didn't disarmed it turn the switch
off<00:02:32.890> real<00:02:33.220> quick<00:02:33.630> and<00:02:37.080> let's<00:02:38.080> start<00:02:38.230> the<00:02:38.290> timer

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
off real quick and let's start the timer

00:02:38.590 --> 00:03:02.670 
off real quick and let's start the timer
again<00:02:38.800> ten<00:02:39.250> seconds<00:02:43.920> here<00:02:44.920> we<00:02:44.950> go<00:03:00.180> okay<00:03:01.680> you

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
again ten seconds here we go okay you
