00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:04.190
 there is the update if all that I say 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:07.360

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:09.340
 ask there what is this 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:12.100
 what is this mode you want to install is 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:15.160

 down you can install it and it 's the last 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:24.520
 version then this one after there what 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:26.140
 what you have to do is once you 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:27.730
 they do not install everything they go to who says 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:29.980

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:43.489
 this is vanilla and here is the 

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:44.930
 york times' I have it there to say 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:47.330

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:19.070
 before it is better that they do not install 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:21.370
 first saw after they have to apply 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:23.600
