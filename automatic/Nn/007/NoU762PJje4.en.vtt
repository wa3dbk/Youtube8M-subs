00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
so this is the mountain equipment cosmic

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:15.650 
so this is the mountain equipment cosmic
1<00:00:10.500> watt<00:00:10.860> LED<00:00:11.430> light<00:00:12.469> here's<00:00:13.469> the<00:00:14.119> the<00:00:15.119> package

already mounted on my bike sit right
here<00:00:36.899> it<00:00:37.679> has<00:00:37.829> three<00:00:37.859> functions<00:00:38.719> the<00:00:39.719> high

00:00:39.919 --> 00:00:39.929 
here it has three functions the high

00:00:39.929 --> 00:00:45.069 
here it has three functions the high
beam<00:00:40.199> the<00:00:40.769> low<00:00:40.920> beam<00:00:41.190> and<00:00:41.629> the<00:00:42.629> flashing<00:00:43.050> light

00:00:45.069 --> 00:00:45.079 
beam the low beam and the flashing light

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:48.139 
beam the low beam and the flashing light
the<00:00:46.079> light<00:00:46.260> come<00:00:46.559> with<00:00:46.829> the<00:00:47.609> mounting

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
the light come with the mounting

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.770 
the light come with the mounting
mounting<00:00:48.690> bracket<00:00:49.350> i<00:00:49.409> guess<00:00:49.620> for<00:00:50.539> just<00:00:51.539> to<00:00:51.629> put

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
mounting bracket i guess for just to put

to<00:00:51.929> put<00:00:52.079> on<00:00:52.170> the<00:00:52.260> front<00:00:52.469> here<00:00:52.639> I<00:00:53.639> don't<00:00:54.030> think

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:54.089 
to put on the front here I don't think

00:00:54.089 --> 00:00:55.309 
to put on the front here I don't think
you<00:00:54.269> could<00:00:54.389> put<00:00:54.539> it<00:00:54.629> on<00:00:54.749> your<00:00:54.839> helmet<00:00:55.050> or

beam<00:02:28.660> and<00:02:28.930> this<00:02:29.470> is<00:02:29.620> the<00:02:29.710> flashing<00:02:30.160> mode<00:02:30.280> I'll

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
beam and this is the flashing mode I'll

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.850 
beam and this is the flashing mode I'll
be<00:02:31.450> approaching<00:02:31.930> the<00:02:31.960> camera<00:02:32.380> in<00:02:32.590> a<00:02:32.680> few
