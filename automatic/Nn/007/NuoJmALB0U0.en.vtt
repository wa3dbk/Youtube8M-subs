00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.250
 difficult to imagine the new opel 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.660
 corsa without a local opc version 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:27.520
 performance center has therefore created a 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:30.419
 ultra- efficient declination of the 

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:30.419
 city ​​to the peaks 

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:35.630
 the previous version had a taste 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:36.920
 unfinished due to a front train 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:38.810
 who had trouble transmitting the 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:41.030
 surge of power delivered by the 

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:42.800
 four cylinder 1 liter 6 turbo nested 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.210
 under his hood so it's on this point 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.880
 especially that engineers have 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:48.230
 worked the new corsa opc is seen 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:50.000
 so now provided with a chassis 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:52.070
 sport developed in collaboration with 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.810
 coni that includes auto shock absorbers 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:55.580
 adjustable able to adapt in time 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:58.420
 real to the driving style and the state of 

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:58.420
 the road meets 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.600
 the engine remained the same it is 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:06.640
 still the 1 liter 6 turbo but wore 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.320
 for the occasion at 207 horses it's 15 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:10.270
 more than in the previous version 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:12.100
 our test model was in addition 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:13.750
 equipped with the performance pack an option to 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.220
 2000 euros which includes a particular 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:16.479
 braking system brembo plus 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.280
 performance and a differential 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:18.729
 mechanically sliding self-locking 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:22.409
 limit 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:22.409
 enough to give some sensations 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:28.299
 unless we can say that she has some 

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:30.450
 a little bit under the hood she's 

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:34.960
 really very funny 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:37.299
 I'm pretty amazed by his ability to 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:39.850
 snatch to get out like that wants 

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:42.759
 to say what other outfit frankly 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:45.580
 it's real it's amazing it's 

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:48.189
 really sporty enough there is a very 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:51.460
 good grip the Michelin tires 

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:53.470
 are really very very effective on 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.880
 place the car to the nearest millimeter 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:57.580
 really the direction has very very 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.480
 precise with the differential at 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:00.880
 limited slip 

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:03.670
 clearly we can enter the 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:06.640
 turns there is no problem its 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:07.300
 impressive fiancee it's really 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.560
 very sporty 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:11.560
 I am extremely surprised 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:14.410
 not expecting that even a city 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.790
 muscular and the 207 horses I can you 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:19.570
 to say that we feel good braking 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:22.750
 it's paris it's incredible fake here 

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:26.170
 the brembo was not useless 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:28.870
 the straight floats are extremely 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:30.120
 effective in keeping the body in 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:33.160
 the armchair 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:36.220
 which is quite amusing is that 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:37.700
 despite this sportiness 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:40.010
 this chassis them 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.780
 very rigid still have kept a 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:45.490
 very good depreciation so is a 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:47.410
 quite appreciable comfort 

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:50.160
 opel sought to make a little bomb 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:50.160
 it succeeded 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:55.170
 this corsa opc is just diabolical 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:04.970
 opel corsa opc it's not just 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:07.010
 a chassis of the brakes and an engine 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:09.200
 sport is also a design that does not 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:10.640
 leave no room for doubt for 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.050
 recognize an opc corsa 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:14.090
 it's not very complicated just 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:16.940
 look at this very aggressive front 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:17.360
 with two air intakes on the shield 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:20.510
 before 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:22.580
 they're mons and then this scoop for 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:25.370
 cool in fact the entirety of this 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:27.800
 motor engine 207 horsepower with a 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:29.690
 very important couple of wheels of 18 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:30.500
 inches equipped with Michelin Pilot tires 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:32.390
 super sport 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.850
 and then the further we go backwards and 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:37.040
 the more you notice the musculature in 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:40.010
 do this corsa opc with this 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:41.330
 mans shoulder very important here and then 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:42.770
 to make sure a little more 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:44.480
 of sportsmanship though you were however 

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:45.560
 not convinced it is enough to bend a 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:47.590
 little bit of looking under the shield 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:50.000
 back and there you see this diffuser 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:51.800
 framed by two mufflers 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.680
 exhaust remus clearly has it 

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:56.270
 done in the sport at opel in 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:58.340
 inside the car there too we 

00:03:56.270 --> 00:04:00.710
 done in sportsmanship with this steering wheel 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:02.540
 three branches and this little my dishes 

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:05.060
 it's really a sign of sportsmanship 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:08.030
 obviously these recaro chairs bac is 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:09.830
 very comfortable very enveloping ya not 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:12.650
 problem cornering it's going to hold 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:14.930
 and then this aluminum pedal has really 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:17.590
 again in this corsa opc have 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:17.590
 done in sportsmanship 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:29.760
 the new corsa opc abba 0 to 100 km 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:33.000
 time in 6.8 seconds and can then 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:34.610
 spun up to 270 km h on circuit or on 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.720
 some parts of the German motorway 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:38.190
 performance that goes with 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:39.990
 unfortunately of mixed consumption 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:42.720
 too high for him to escape 

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:45.060
 to a penalty even if it is contained in 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:47.250
 7.5 liters in mixed cycle his thirst for 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:48.900
 unleaded penalizes it by 2200 euros which 

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:52.520
 is added to the 23 1800 euros 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:52.520
 claimed out of options by opel 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:02.510
 despite this in view of the competition 

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:06.370
 we can say that the new opel corsa 

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:06.370
 opc stays in the race
