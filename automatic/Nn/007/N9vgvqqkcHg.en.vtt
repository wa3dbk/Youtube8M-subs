00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.540 
are being tested here for the first time
including<00:00:40.690> the<00:00:41.110> crane<00:00:42.010> each<00:00:42.190> that<00:00:42.430> we're

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:42.550 
including the crane each that we're

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:45.479 
including the crane each that we're
using<00:00:42.760> super<00:00:43.690> sized<00:00:43.870> element<00:00:44.140> 63<00:00:44.920> behind<00:00:45.309> me

00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:45.489 
using super sized element 63 behind me

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:50.130 
using super sized element 63 behind me
weighs<00:00:46.079> roughly<00:00:47.079> 41<00:00:47.860> tons<00:00:48.479> the<00:00:49.479> first<00:00:49.720> element

weighs roughly 41 tons the first element
going<00:00:50.409> up<00:00:50.559> presented<00:00:51.550> us<00:00:51.670> with<00:00:51.760> a<00:00:51.909> number<00:00:52.269> of

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
going up presented us with a number of

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.240 
going up presented us with a number of
questions<00:00:53.500> that<00:00:53.590> we<00:00:53.739> didn't<00:00:54.010> know<00:00:54.100> the

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:54.250 
questions that we didn't know the

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:56.400 
questions that we didn't know the
answers<00:00:54.579> to<00:00:54.609> before<00:00:55.090> we<00:00:55.210> started<00:00:55.870> this<00:00:56.019> lift

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:56.410 
answers to before we started this lift

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:58.979 
answers to before we started this lift
for<00:00:57.070> example<00:00:57.609> we<00:00:58.030> knew<00:00:58.300> the<00:00:58.449> theoretical

00:00:58.979 --> 00:00:58.989 
for example we knew the theoretical

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:00.990 
for example we knew the theoretical
weight<00:00:59.199> of<00:00:59.379> the<00:00:59.559> element<00:00:59.890> but<00:01:00.640> we<00:01:00.730> didn't<00:01:00.910> know

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:01.000 
weight of the element but we didn't know

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.459 
weight of the element but we didn't know
the<00:01:01.120> actual<00:01:01.390> weight<00:01:01.600> until<00:01:01.809> we<00:01:02.019> picked<00:01:02.260> it<00:01:02.350> up

00:01:02.459 --> 00:01:02.469 
the actual weight until we picked it up

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:06.270 
the actual weight until we picked it up
only<00:01:02.829> 30<00:01:03.250> minutes<00:01:03.489> ago<00:01:04.080> our<00:01:05.250> theory<00:01:06.250> was

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:06.280 
only 30 minutes ago our theory was

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.120 
only 30 minutes ago our theory was
within<00:01:06.670> half<00:01:06.970> a<00:01:07.149> ton<00:01:07.360> of<00:01:07.390> the<00:01:07.690> actual<00:01:08.130> it's

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:09.130 
within half a ton of the actual it's

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:11.100 
within half a ton of the actual it's
being<00:01:09.700> lifted<00:01:09.970> up<00:01:10.240> on<00:01:10.420> top<00:01:10.660> of<00:01:10.810> the<00:01:10.899> steel

in place where the crane is sitting
behind<00:01:25.479> me<00:01:25.869> this<00:01:26.590> area<00:01:27.159> had<00:01:27.310> to<00:01:27.340> be<00:01:27.460> backfilled

00:01:27.749 --> 00:01:27.759 
behind me this area had to be backfilled

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:30.569 
behind me this area had to be backfilled
and<00:01:28.210> compacted<00:01:28.840> and<00:01:29.530> tested<00:01:29.979> ready<00:01:30.189> to<00:01:30.369> take

and compacted and tested ready to take

00:01:30.579 --> 00:01:33.300 
and compacted and tested ready to take
the<00:01:30.729> extra<00:01:31.060> weight<00:01:31.210> off<00:01:31.659> the<00:01:31.990> crane<00:01:32.229> the<00:01:33.070> crane

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:33.310 
the extra weight off the crane the crane

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:35.399 
the extra weight off the crane the crane
is<00:01:33.460> sitting<00:01:33.759> on<00:01:33.880> a<00:01:33.909> number<00:01:34.210> of<00:01:34.240> steel<00:01:34.570> pads<00:01:34.930> the

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:35.409 
is sitting on a number of steel pads the

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:37.679 
is sitting on a number of steel pads the
steel<00:01:35.649> pads<00:01:35.950> have<00:01:36.130> been<00:01:36.310> brought<00:01:36.579> in<00:01:36.790> to

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:37.689 
steel pads have been brought in to

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:39.510 
steel pads have been brought in to
enable<00:01:38.350> us<00:01:38.469> to<00:01:38.590> spread<00:01:38.799> the<00:01:38.920> load<00:01:39.189> of<00:01:39.399> the

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:39.520 
enable us to spread the load of the

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.030 
enable us to spread the load of the
crane<00:01:39.790> they're<00:01:40.570> running<00:01:40.840> 96<00:01:41.439> of<00:01:41.590> these<00:01:41.740> pads

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:42.040 
crane they're running 96 of these pads

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.969 
crane they're running 96 of these pads
so<00:01:43.000> as<00:01:43.270> you<00:01:43.390> can<00:01:43.540> see<00:01:43.600> we're<00:01:44.020> having<00:01:44.290> to<00:01:44.439> lift

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:44.979 
so as you can see we're having to lift

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:47.789 
so as you can see we're having to lift
the<00:01:45.850> pads<00:01:46.119> from<00:01:46.270> behind<00:01:46.659> the<00:01:46.810> crane<00:01:47.079> place

the pads from behind the crane place

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:49.709 
the pads from behind the crane place
them<00:01:47.979> in<00:01:48.100> front<00:01:48.130> to<00:01:48.909> enable<00:01:49.240> the<00:01:49.329> crane<00:01:49.540> to

00:01:49.709 --> 00:01:49.719 
them in front to enable the crane to

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:51.830 
them in front to enable the crane to
then<00:01:49.840> track<00:01:50.110> forward<00:01:50.530> onto<00:01:50.680> these<00:01:50.920> these<00:01:51.369> pad

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
then track forward onto these these pad

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.410 
then track forward onto these these pad
the<00:01:52.840> crane<00:01:53.110> is<00:01:53.490> going<00:01:54.490> to<00:01:54.610> be<00:01:54.729> able<00:01:54.880> to<00:01:55.060> track

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:55.420 
the crane is going to be able to track

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.569 
the crane is going to be able to track
forward<00:01:55.869> at<00:01:56.170> a<00:01:56.350> maximum<00:01:56.829> speed<00:01:56.979> of<00:01:57.189> one

the new crane that comes in in in a few
weeks<00:02:50.709> time<00:02:50.920> will<00:02:51.459> be<00:02:51.549> able<00:02:51.670> to<00:02:51.790> reach<00:02:51.940> double

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:52.239 
weeks time will be able to reach double

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:55.199 
weeks time will be able to reach double
that<00:02:52.510> distance<00:02:52.980> enabling<00:02:53.980> us<00:02:54.129> to<00:02:54.160> lift<00:02:54.519> the

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:55.209 
that distance enabling us to lift the

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:57.500 
that distance enabling us to lift the
rest<00:02:55.420> of<00:02:55.569> the<00:02:55.629> 85<00:02:56.079> sections<00:02:56.890> for<00:02:57.220> the<00:02:57.250> roof
