two DC motor based on which the Robo
entire<00:00:58.050> system<00:00:58.410> is<00:00:58.530> controlled<00:00:59.010> so<00:00:59.670> to<00:00:59.730> the

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
entire system is controlled so to the

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.580 
entire system is controlled so to the
same<00:01:00.210> entire<00:01:00.629> system<00:01:00.960> the<00:01:00.989> external<00:01:01.410> feature

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
same entire system the external feature

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.170 
same entire system the external feature
is<00:01:01.920> a<00:01:01.980> metal<00:01:02.309> detection<00:01:02.550> sensor

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
is a metal detection sensor

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.270 
is a metal detection sensor
so<00:01:03.600> this<00:01:03.809> is<00:01:03.899> our<00:01:04.049> metal<00:01:04.379> detection<00:01:04.619> sensor<00:01:05.100> a

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
so this is our metal detection sensor a

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.270 
so this is our metal detection sensor a
difference<00:01:05.939> you<00:01:06.180> can<00:01:06.360> see<00:01:06.570> here<00:01:07.010> the<00:01:08.010> copper

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
difference you can see here the copper

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.580 
difference you can see here the copper
coil<00:01:08.549> which<00:01:08.850> detects<00:01:09.150> any<00:01:09.540> metallic<00:01:09.960> thing

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
coil which detects any metallic thing

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.580 
coil which detects any metallic thing
that<00:01:10.890> comes<00:01:11.130> under<00:01:11.490> its<00:01:11.880> way<00:01:12.119> so<00:01:12.720> and<00:01:13.260> even

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
that comes under its way so and even

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.590 
that comes under its way so and even
automatically<00:01:14.100> it<00:01:14.250> gives<00:01:14.490> using<00:01:15.090> buzzer<00:01:15.330> as

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
automatically it gives using buzzer as

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.690 
automatically it gives using buzzer as
an<00:01:15.930> indication<00:01:16.320> so<00:01:17.009> automatically<00:01:17.490> the

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
an indication so automatically the

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:18.980 
an indication so automatically the
