00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:05.900
 the videogame industry advances 

00:00:03.319 --> 00:00:08.269
 in a fairly fast way companies 

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.940
 have tried to enter this market without 

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:13.220
 get to touch success others achieved 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:15.769
 achieve glory and thanks to the take 

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:19.130
 of bad decisions descended from 

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:21.829
 incredible ways many of these 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:24.800
 companies have launched a large market 

00:00:21.829 --> 00:00:27.140
 variety of videogames some acclaimed 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:28.999
 and remembered by all of us at 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:32.510
 that we are involved in this hobby 

00:00:28.999 --> 00:00:35.350
 and others passed without pain or glory 

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:38.000
 or they just fell into oblivion 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:39.620
 behind a good console there are other 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.660
 that never got to step on land 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:44.090
 commercial consoles that mostly 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:46.910
 they were good ideas but they only stayed in 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:51.400
 that on this occasion you will see some 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:51.400
 consoles that never went to market 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:59.990
 behind the great acceptance of 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:02.960
 oculus reed project are your 

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:03.800
 ancestors if you roam for 20 years or 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.410
 plus 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:10.010
 you will remember the virtual boy released in the 

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:11.750
 year 1995 was the bet of nintendo on 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:14.240
 the fifth generation of consoles 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:16.220
 after managing to govern much 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:19.400
 of the video game market with the 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:21.680
 super nintendo took out this console that by 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:25.820
 its bad gameplay and terrible section 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:28.430
 visual was a resounding failure but 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:31.400
 before nintendo sega had its own 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:33.350
 proposal in this market the idea of â€‹â€‹a 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:35.810
 virtual reality peripheral that 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:37.369
 thanks to the success of sega genesis the 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.320
 company had the capital 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:42.110
 necessary to work in the development 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:44.750
 of new consoles simultaneously what 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:47.690
 that they were looking for with the wax br 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:50.090
 a new gaming experience will submerge 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:53.060
 the player in his favorite video game and 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:55.149
 embody the protagonist's skin his 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:58.820
 market access was planned for 

00:01:55.149 --> 00:02:01.310
 1994 one year before the virtual boy or 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:03.350
 be three years after your announcement 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.420
 although the hull was finished not 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:07.729
 saw the light because many of the 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:09.649
 testers who tried it presented 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:12.140
 discomforts like headaches and 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:14.330
 dizziness so sega canceled his 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:17.000
 marketing to not face 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:19.040
 a resounding commercial failure and how 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.390
 we all know who paid for the dishes 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.390
 broken was nintendo 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:28.760
 nowadays thanks to external companies 

00:02:26.329 --> 00:02:30.650
 or to the community of players we can 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.569
 find consoles in the market 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:36.079
 laptops that play games 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:37.219
 super nintendo but in 1992 to nintendo 

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:39.920
 it occurred to him to launch a version 

00:02:37.219 --> 00:02:42.799
 laptop from his recent console the most 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:45.500
 successful in the age of 16 bits the 

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:47.720
 super nintendo or super famicom for its 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.909
 name in japan after bringing to 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.530
 nintendo's game boy market 

00:02:49.909 --> 00:02:53.719
 with the necessary experience to 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:55.819
 perform an adaptation of your console 

00:02:53.719 --> 00:02:58.760
 desktop to the laptop market 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:03:01.129
 but that unfortunately and without 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:04.590
 reasons the project was canceled leaving 

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:06.660
 I only get a prototype 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:09.060
 if you're young and you're not fully 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:11.040
 in this universe most likely 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.780
 you do not know that atari long before 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.670
 create mobile games like you do today in 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.560
 day was one of the monsters of the 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:18.540
 industry developing not only 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.190
 videogames but that was also 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:23.010
 within the war of the consoles by 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:25.349
 80 just the battle 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:27.750
 pound microsoft sony and nintendo in 

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:30.480
 our time was lived by the hands of 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:33.239
 sega atari and nintendo kill and I was 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:35.730
 declining thanks to its tying and 7,800 

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:38.250
 console that could not survive against the 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:41.250
 net or the master system so I was 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:43.440
 for starting another round the age of 16 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:46.290
 videos with the megadrive sega in the 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:48.450
 market and the assumption of the snes by 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:50.579
 part of nintendo atari had to 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:52.319
 start to develop a new console 

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:54.239
 able to stand before his 

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:56.970
 competitors looking for superiority 

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:59.579
 before these, so it was proposed to create 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:01.620
 a 32-bit console next to 

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:04.349
 development of his successor to which now 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:06.720
 it is known as atar and jaguar following 

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:07.650
 with their feline names panther was going 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:10.889
 good way 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:11.250
 ran at 16 megahertz and had a pallet 

00:04:10.889 --> 00:04:12.990
 of 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:14.940
 is that it reached more than 8 thousand 

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:17.400
 simultaneous colors on screen 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:20.190
 far surpassing the consoles in the 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:21.959
 market near its final phase and to see 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:24.630
 that the tariff before failed to excite 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:27.270
 to the atari market he took the wrong 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:29.010
 decision to abandon this project and 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:31.530
 go through the production of the 

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:33.210
 a decision that led to the 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:35.490
 disappearance of the company in the 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:38.070
 console market for failure 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:40.560
 HAWAII commercial showing that in 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:42.720
 this industry do not forgive the bad 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:45.000
 decisions 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:46.740
 these were some of the consoles that 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.050
 they never came to the market for some 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:50.760
 motive or another you would like that 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:52.950
 Some of them would have seen the light 

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:55.260
 let me know in the comment box 

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:57.120
