00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:07.680
 when we see such a riot of colors and 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.900
 Forms it is difficult to believe that everything began 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:14.700
 here with this soft there someone in 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:15.240
 substances this cream is not natural 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.060
 material 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.320
 sand mixtures with solvents 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.680
 and stabilizers 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.420
 like potash and lime glass blowers 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.090
 adds there fragments of glass with 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:33.989
 previous melt and loads the entire mixture 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:36.230
 in the smelter after spending 12 hours at 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.730
 temperature of 1200 degrees Celsius 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:41.000
 the material turns colorless 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.739
 liquid glass 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.039
 now the glassblower takes a steel tube with 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:50.570
 funnel shaped end and with its help 

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:50.570
 picks up a ball of molten mass 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.690
 and and I paint prokatova on small 

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:01.329
 prog 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:03.790
 stained glass at this stage 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:06.360
 glass melt has the consistency of honey and 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:08.770
 cools very quickly and hardens 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.810
 glassblower again and heats in the stove 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:17.680
 smaller and colored layer 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:19.509
 securely fastened to give 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:24.210
 glass lump shape 

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:24.210
 it is rolled on the block as a ladle 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:31.090
 a couple of neat breaths and it turns out 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:33.100
 empty bubble to this point glass 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:37.470
 cooling by caramel consistency 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.470
 staying supple and flexible 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.690
 glassblower stretches and arches 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.869
 material through various blocks and 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:48.890
 tools now the glass is hardened and 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:51.659
 easy to hold final shape 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:56.460
 master outlines the line cut of the future 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:58.860
 products and cools his air on the other 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:01.320
 countries using droplets of melted 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:05.970
 glass sets steel rod 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:08.130
 so-called pontius then master 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:12.959
 dripping cold water on the cutting line and 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:17.000
 breaks off a product hole 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:19.620
 sealed with another ponti and 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.140
 then the details sends meetings again 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:24.390
 to connect them to glass 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:27.140
 permanently rotate another product 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.140
 get crooked 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:30.400
 glassblower again gives the mass 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:32.769
 form 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.430
 but now not with the tools a 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:36.519
 manually 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:39.390
 protects against burns a thick layer of 

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:39.390
 wet newspapers 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:47.340
 with the help of ordinary scissors are made 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:47.340
 hems 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:59.410
 then they twist into a spiral and 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:00.240
 the glass is cooled with a jet 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:02.650
 of air 

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:04.900
 then the master quickly makes 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:09.850
 hole to equalize the temperature 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:12.970
 inside and outside to create this 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:14.290
 products took just 8 minutes now to 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:16.590
 the item is not cracked 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:20.250
 sends it to the electric furnace for 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:20.250
 12 hour quenching 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:27.850
 meanwhile the glassblower takes up 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:30.100
 making a large vase blowing process 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:33.730
 giving shape this time will be a little 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:34.180
 longer while the helper continues to blow in 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:37.090
 a tube 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:37.840
 master cools but the base is wet 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:41.080
 newspapers 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:42.670
 it will keep the shape of the product while on it 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:45.340
 will cut line 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:47.920
 to soften his glass again 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:50.740
 heat and it stretches into a vase 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:53.100
 but straighten with wood 

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:53.100
 block 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:04:00.170
 and now it's time to move on to decorating 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:03.470
 vase surface 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:07.430
 like a cord is wound bright color 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:09.950
 glass if from the finished product 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:12.470
 We have to cut off the unnecessary details 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:20.540
 rough edges are sure to file and 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:22.160
 not only do they polish glass 

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:24.950
 familiar glasses and vases 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:26.360
 but for example mortars and pestles so 

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:29.530
 if you wish, you can make a glass 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:29.530
 all your kitchen
