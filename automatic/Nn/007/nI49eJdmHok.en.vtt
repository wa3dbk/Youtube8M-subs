00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.210
 hello everyone my name is friend and it went 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.210
 what's better 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:18.710
 now the machine is not subject 

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:20.570
 luxury like it was 50 years ago you 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:22.160
 only if it is of course not ferrari and in 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:24.529
 In this issue I would like not 2 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:26.900
 quite popular car brands 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:29.980
 it was in and the audi of the movie was you was 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:31.850
 founded by karl arapka in 1913 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:35.390
 officially registered only 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:37.790
 experiment year after 1917 in those years 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:39.620
 combat manufactured parts for aviation 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:43.190
 By the way everyone knows the company logo 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:45.410
 appeared in 1929 and it depicts 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:49.520
 aircraft winx against the blue sky 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:51.559
 the history of audi begins in 1899 exactly 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.910
 in those years august opened his 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:55.969
 first enterprise 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:58.039
 and in 1909 he created 

00:00:55.969 --> 00:01:00.530
 company called automobile 

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:02.989
 plant audi and unlike bmw they immediately 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:05.059
 started making cars now I think 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:06.320
 it is worth returning today volume 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:09.110
 car production 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.670
 and u is about one million 148 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:13.340
 thousand a year lpnp 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:15.830
 about 1 million 200 thousand and direct 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:18.610
 companies about 5 billion euros a year 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:21.409
 audi 4 billion opi is enough 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:23.840
 recognizable but poems are more 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:24.950
 popular for example the so-called 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.409
 boomer about which 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:29.299
 and now many dream or the same 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:30.860
 beha and books on speed most wanted 

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:33.740
 Like if you played this game 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:36.259
 few know but bmw and audi goes 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:38.509
 original advertising war many times in 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:40.520
 their advertising and did not touch each other and 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:42.650
 we don't even notice it yet 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.780
 feel brand cars enough 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:47.210
 difficult to assess as there are different 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:49.100
 models each have their own preferences but 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:51.259
 research results cars 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:53.060
 brands audi better saved toga 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:54.680
 used cars among 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.750
 BMW cars with the most popular 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:58.180
 is an 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:59.650
 called a boomer and among audi by many 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:01.930
 beloved audi tt 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:03.970
 but it's pretty old models 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:05.920
 If you take a new one, then probably the most 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:09.190
 beloved was hysterical 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:11.320
 although audi r8 is also quite popular i 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:13.570
 I took these particular brands of cars because 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:15.100
 that they are very similar to each other I would 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:17.650
 of course I could rent cars 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:19.870
 mercedes-benz or car site lecture 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:22.360
 sacrifices luxury to our show 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:24.730
 showed that the best cars are bmw 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:26.770
 in general put likes write comments 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:29.100

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:29.100
