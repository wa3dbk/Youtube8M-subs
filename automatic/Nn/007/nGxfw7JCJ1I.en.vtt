00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:07.680
 years 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.440
 there is a detail that we can not forget 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.910
 and they are those complements generally 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.500
 to put in the head of our 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.719
 there are girls with children we have it more 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.730
 complicated because there is nothing with what 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.640
 complement them but in order for 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:23.009
 girls there are precious things that 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.560
 she also works true is a joint partner 

00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:26.699
 with patricia de marisco, because it's going to 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.679
 tell because I believe that she is 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.259
 in love with this collection true elena 

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:32.880
 tell me I was going to teach you for the 

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:34.230
 charades fairies that I think fits 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.320
 perfectly everything you have 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.570
 tell me the collection is handmade 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:42.660
 absolutely a designer who lives her 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:45.090
 collection your creativity and it's also 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.620
 possible when we ask for some because 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.780
 they ask us especially for some of the 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.880
 diadems it's hard to repeat 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.950
 because he has to be free to do what 

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:54.840
 that she likes, of course, is creative and 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:56.580
 when then each of the girls told him 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.800
 they make sure they feel special 

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:00.630
 different absolutely that is 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.340
 difficult to find one like another is 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:06.160
 very difficult for this to find it 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:07.660
 by many places or by very scarce 

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:09.940
 sites we are going to do something elena 

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:11.320
 let's teach is teaching rosalia 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:13.450
 our camera some of the things by 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:15.310
 example is being stopped in a 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:18.580
 butterfly me have loved 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:21.369
 It is made to detail with lace and 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:23.770
 yarn wheelock on layer is a job 

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:25.479
 craft that you have to appreciate or 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:27.130
 It is impressive what it does 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:29.619
 it is not normal to find at this time 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:31.900
 someone who can devote to doing 

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:33.490
 in such an exquisite way 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:35.380
 details like butterflies 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:37.060
 we've seen a headband there with 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:39.790
 dragonfly I think you know that there was 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:41.410
 some moms before looking at her for a 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:44.080
 communion for example for an occasion 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:46.600
 special with this little detail you already have it 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:48.280
 all done yes yes yes yes yes totally or 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.259
 be the head is already whole but also 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:52.300
 that is what I want to also highlight is 

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:54.340
 than she right now what we have here 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:57.130
 is the first communion collection with 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:02:00.820
 which the tones are these but she 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:03.369
 buy the tapes in natural color and 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.960
 dye them to the colors that she wants 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:06.910
 to put that in that moment lives that in that 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:09.670
 moment wants wants to do is that 

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:11.380
 exclusive is different from these 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:17.130
 tapes or whatever there are are feathers 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:20.730
 also leaves that to imitate the flowers 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:23.310
 every detail and the crown for example a 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:25.410
 crown but so simple that the girl who 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:28.020
 take them evidently will feel like 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:29.910
 a princess but the mom even good 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:32.640
 for the family will say how fine is this 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:35.160
 will be happy because he has nothing is 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.990
 pure simplicity does not not need anything the 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:41.250
 Elegance is pure simplicity if we 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:42.990
 it is ornate or ugly and these printed 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.970

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:48.630
 have you helped us if you wanted to stand out 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:49.920
 something this does to place the 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:52.860
 tiaras in the rooms of the 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:54.900
 girls do not do not ask him to repeat to you that 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:57.030
 original is a creative will not come out 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.530
 never that face will come another one that in 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:00.150

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.070

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:13.710
