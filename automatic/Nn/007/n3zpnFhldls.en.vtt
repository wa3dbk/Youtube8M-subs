00:03:31.659 --> 00:03:38.079
 number of the mega sena 21 to the tens are 

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:40.720
 typed on this computer that makes the 

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:43.090
 calculation on the 31st with the mega 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:46.659

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:48.760
 30 minutes right here does not appear 

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:52.720
 the premium amount the amount of 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:56.199
 winners and the ages of the lucky 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:59.250
 Does anyone know of the only lucky one? 

00:03:56.199 --> 00:04:00.669
 contest that the 1,138 of the mega sena 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:03.069
 accumulated 

00:04:00.669 --> 00:04:05.049
 but in the upset draw it will not go 

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:07.510
 not for the first time in the 

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:08.769
 mega sena history is required 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:11.560
 there is a winner 

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:13.900
 those who make the most points take the 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:17.220
 not going out with six hits will be with five 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:21.120
 otherwise going out with you will be with four 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:22.980
 and there the chances increase and much if the 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:26.550
 probability of winning at mega-sena 

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:29.520
 average is one in 50 million 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:31.590
 to hit five numbers is much easier 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:34.560
 which calculates this engineer who created 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:36.600
 a newspaper specializing in lotteries is the 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:38.070
 your chance increases by more than 300 times 

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:39.750
 win 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:44.400
 What's the use of playing the most numbers? 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:49.050
 drawn the 41 is champion left 134 times 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:51.360
 since the mega sena was established in 1996 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:55.020
 all numbers have the same chance of 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:57.300
 to be drawn doubly is good 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:05:01.860
 you also know with a more number 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:05.100
 unlucky mega sena is the 26 came out only 84 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:07.980
 times and you know that great idea that 

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:11.130
 You think it's unheard of, think again. 

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:15.750
 at least 2,000 people each 

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:19.290
 there is a risk in the sequence 123456 or 

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:22.350
 the mysterious serial numbers lost and 

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:24.300
 so far nothing 

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:27.540
 There are people who are roasting 

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:30.150
 fortune and winning chez who already earned 

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:32.570
 almost two million in the mega sena is in the 

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:35.190
 very high individual dimensions 

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:38.580
 of the person's interest 

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:40.260
 the total stretch of the ball if you notice the 

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:43.050
 group hans 

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:46.230
 the superstitious can still make the 

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:49.020
 Fadinha in the luckiest city in Brazil 

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:52.110
 while hollywood has its 

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:56.070
 fame only guaratinguetá in the interior of são 

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:58.500
 paulo has the luck sidewalk and that only 

00:05:56.070 --> 00:06:02.160
 had in this lottery the prize of the mega 

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:05.420
 sena has already left twice in 2004 the 

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:07.950
 around 12 million reais in 2005 

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:09.840
 44 million reais 

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:14.670
 and do not stop there not if we walk 

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:18.000
 a little more than 50 meters later in this 

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:20.070
 another lottery once again four months 

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:23.310
 He left behind the mega sena 

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:24.450
 this time the hefty was around 22 

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:26.760
 millions of reais 

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:30.390
 that's the question what guaratinguetá 

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:33.000
 Well it may be because Sao Paulo is the state 

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:36.810
 who bet the most and who has won the most 

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:39.420
 2009 21% of total premiums greater than 

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:43.020
 5 thousand reais per year and is in the 

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:45.170
 with only 0.04 percent of the sum 

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:48.270
 but there may also be 

00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:52.020
 influence of the heavens in this story 

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:55.230
 will it be the saint to inject is earth 

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:57.750
