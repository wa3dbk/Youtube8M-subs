but<00:02:14.680> still<00:02:14.920> searching<00:02:15.400> for<00:02:15.430> his<00:02:15.610> first<00:02:15.880> keeper

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:16.300 
but still searching for his first keeper

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:26.480 
but still searching for his first keeper
oh<00:02:18.600> yeah<00:02:19.600> he's<00:02:19.810> on<00:02:19.930> it<00:02:20.050> again<00:02:20.320> and<00:02:20.530> there<00:02:20.860> we<00:02:20.890> go

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:26.490 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:34.260 

I'll<00:02:27.490> grab<00:02:27.730> the<00:02:27.850> net<00:02:28.060> for<00:02:28.240> this<00:02:28.330> one<00:02:33.270> hopefully

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:34.270 
I'll grab the net for this one hopefully

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:37.770 
I'll grab the net for this one hopefully
is<00:02:34.420> big<00:02:34.630> enough<00:02:34.840> I<00:02:35.230> think<00:02:35.890> he'll<00:02:36.160> be<00:02:36.190> SARS<00:02:36.780> as

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
is big enough I think he'll be SARS as

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:39.540 
is big enough I think he'll be SARS as
we<00:02:37.930> look<00:02:38.080> at<00:02:38.170> the<00:02:38.230> Ford<00:02:38.470> Ranger<00:02:38.680> replay<00:02:39.190> Steve

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 
Duff like all of our pros casting it in

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:43.320 
Duff like all of our pros casting it in
between<00:02:41.709> the<00:02:41.950> floating<00:02:42.459> racks<00:02:42.670> the<00:02:43.150> more

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:43.330 
between the floating racks the more

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:44.850 
between the floating racks the more
times<00:02:43.570> it<00:02:43.720> can<00:02:43.810> get<00:02:43.930> his<00:02:44.050> lure<00:02:44.260> in<00:02:44.470> that<00:02:44.620> shade

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:44.860 
times it can get his lure in that shade

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:48.500 
times it can get his lure in that shade
zone<00:02:45.160> the<00:02:45.489> more<00:02:45.640> bites<00:02:45.850> he's<00:02:46.090> going<00:02:46.269> to<00:02:46.330> get

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
zone the more bites he's going to get

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:51.449 
zone the more bites he's going to get
how<00:02:49.510> different<00:02:50.050> are<00:02:50.290> these<00:02:50.560> oyster<00:02:51.250> racks

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:51.459 
how different are these oyster racks

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:53.220 
how different are these oyster racks
here<00:02:51.700> that<00:02:51.910> we're<00:02:52.060> used<00:02:52.269> to<00:02:52.360> seeing<00:02:52.600> like<00:02:52.959> for

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
here that we're used to seeing like for

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:55.380 
here that we're used to seeing like for
somewhere<00:02:53.560> in<00:02:53.680> foster<00:02:54.160> look<00:02:54.880> these<00:02:55.060> floating

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
somewhere in foster look these floating

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:57.030 
somewhere in foster look these floating
racks<00:02:55.690> you<00:02:55.810> do<00:02:56.080> need<00:02:56.290> to<00:02:56.410> fish<00:02:56.620> them<00:02:56.769> a<00:02:56.830> little

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
racks you do need to fish them a little

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:58.440 
racks you do need to fish them a little
bit<00:02:57.130> differently<00:02:57.489> often<00:02:57.970> they're<00:02:58.120> they're

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
bit differently often they're they're

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:00.509 
bit differently often they're they're
more<00:02:58.630> up<00:02:58.870> in<00:02:59.050> quite<00:02:59.290> deep<00:02:59.560> water<00:02:59.800> and<00:03:00.070> all<00:03:00.489> the

00:03:00.509 --> 00:03:00.519 
more up in quite deep water and all the

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:02.759 
more up in quite deep water and all the
action<00:03:01.030> is<00:03:01.180> typically<00:03:01.690> right<00:03:02.080> up<00:03:02.290> underneath

00:03:02.759 --> 00:03:02.769 
action is typically right up underneath

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:04.710 
action is typically right up underneath
the<00:03:03.370> floats<00:03:03.670> and<00:03:03.880> underneath<00:03:04.269> those<00:03:04.450> hanging

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 
the floats and underneath those hanging

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:06.420 
the floats and underneath those hanging
cages<00:03:05.230> rather<00:03:05.470> than<00:03:05.680> down<00:03:05.830> near<00:03:06.040> the<00:03:06.070> bottom

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430 
cages rather than down near the bottom

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:08.100 
cages rather than down near the bottom
so<00:03:06.580> the<00:03:06.940> fish<00:03:07.120> tend<00:03:07.360> to<00:03:07.420> be<00:03:07.510> very<00:03:07.690> close<00:03:07.930> to<00:03:08.049> the

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:08.110 
so the fish tend to be very close to the

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:09.539 
so the fish tend to be very close to the
surface<00:03:08.440> a<00:03:08.500> lot<00:03:08.590> of<00:03:08.650> times<00:03:08.920> with<00:03:09.459> your

00:03:09.539 --> 00:03:09.549 
surface a lot of times with your

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:10.949 
surface a lot of times with your
polarized<00:03:09.970> sunglasses<00:03:10.209> you<00:03:10.690> can<00:03:10.810> actually

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:10.959 
polarized sunglasses you can actually

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:13.050 
polarized sunglasses you can actually
see<00:03:11.320> fish<00:03:11.560> in<00:03:11.739> there<00:03:11.950> but<00:03:12.519> it's<00:03:12.670> really

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 
see fish in there but it's really

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.180 
see fish in there but it's really
important<00:03:13.570> to<00:03:13.989> get<00:03:14.110> the<00:03:14.230> lure<00:03:14.440> as<00:03:14.620> close<00:03:14.980> as

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:15.190 
important to get the lure as close as

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:18.240 
important to get the lure as close as
you<00:03:15.280> possibly<00:03:15.310> can<00:03:16.090> to<00:03:16.329> the<00:03:16.660> structure<00:03:17.260> oh<00:03:17.410> and

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.250 
you possibly can to the structure oh and

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:19.860 
you possibly can to the structure oh and
the<00:03:18.400> fish<00:03:18.579> will<00:03:18.670> come<00:03:18.850> out<00:03:19.030> and<00:03:19.180> have<00:03:19.510> a<00:03:19.540> go<00:03:19.720> at

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:19.870 
the fish will come out and have a go at

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:21.110 
the fish will come out and have a go at
it

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
it

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.340 
it
there's<00:03:22.120> some<00:03:22.269> fish<00:03:22.450> in<00:03:22.660> here<00:03:22.870> it's<00:03:23.170> also

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:23.350 
there's some fish in here it's also

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:24.660 
there's some fish in here it's also
important<00:03:23.860> to<00:03:23.920> look<00:03:24.040> at<00:03:24.160> what<00:03:24.250> the<00:03:24.400> tides

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:24.670 
important to look at what the tides

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:26.850 
important to look at what the tides
doing<00:03:25.090> we've<00:03:25.239> got<00:03:25.390> to<00:03:25.480> run<00:03:25.630> outside<00:03:26.140> here<00:03:26.440> the

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:26.860 
doing we've got to run outside here the

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:29.100 
doing we've got to run outside here the
fish<00:03:27.130> tend<00:03:27.430> to<00:03:27.549> accumulate<00:03:27.910> towards<00:03:28.810> the<00:03:28.930> up

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:29.110 
fish tend to accumulate towards the up

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:30.720 
fish tend to accumulate towards the up
current<00:03:29.709> end<00:03:29.920> of<00:03:30.100> the<00:03:30.190> structure<00:03:30.489> if<00:03:30.670> you

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730 
current end of the structure if you

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:32.190 
current end of the structure if you
think<00:03:30.940> of<00:03:31.000> it<00:03:31.090> like<00:03:31.120> a<00:03:31.239> boat<00:03:31.540> pushing<00:03:31.959> into<00:03:32.110> the

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:32.200 
think of it like a boat pushing into the

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:33.990 
think of it like a boat pushing into the
current<00:03:32.560> they'll<00:03:33.010> be<00:03:33.130> up<00:03:33.250> near<00:03:33.459> the<00:03:33.579> bow<00:03:33.760> I

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:34.000 
current they'll be up near the bow I

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.630 
current they'll be up near the bow I

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:52.400 
mentioning that the the flow seems a

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:53.890 
mentioning that the the flow seems a
little<00:04:52.520> slow<00:04:52.880> at<00:04:53.060> the<00:04:53.150> moment<00:04:53.180> that<00:04:53.570> may<00:04:53.690> pick

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:53.900 
little slow at the moment that may pick

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:56.350
