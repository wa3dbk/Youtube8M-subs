00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:20.240 
did not chamber because because I didn't

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.360 
did not chamber because because I didn't
have<00:02:20.360> a<00:02:20.390> firm<00:02:20.720> grip<00:02:20.990> the<00:02:21.560> slide<00:02:21.860> did<00:02:22.010> not<00:02:22.160> go

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
have a firm grip the slide did not go

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:24.699 
have a firm grip the slide did not go
back<00:02:22.670> far<00:02:22.970> enough<00:02:23.000> to<00:02:23.690> actually<00:02:23.870> cycle<00:02:24.440> around
