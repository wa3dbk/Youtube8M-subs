opinion and now let's go ahead and go

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.180 
opinion and now let's go ahead and go
into<00:00:47.400> the<00:00:47.940> classes<00:00:48.720> I<00:00:48.930> have<00:00:49.500> five<00:00:49.890> different

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
into the classes I have five different

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.450 
into the classes I have five different
classes<00:00:51.230> one<00:00:52.230> submachine<00:00:52.740> gun<00:00:52.890> class<00:00:53.160> once

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
classes one submachine gun class once

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.590 
classes one submachine gun class once
all<00:00:53.730> rifle<00:00:54.120> class<00:00:54.980> rushing<00:00:55.980> class<00:00:56.190> and<00:00:56.640> a

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
all rifle class rushing class and a

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.740 
all rifle class rushing class and a
class<00:00:57.660> two<00:00:58.320> classes<00:00:58.680> that<00:00:58.770> you<00:00:58.920> need<00:00:58.950> on

00:00:59.740 --> 00:00:59.750 
class two classes that you need on

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:03.380 
class two classes that you need on
pretty<00:01:00.750> much<00:01:01.130> you<00:01:02.130> just<00:01:02.370> need<00:01:02.610> them<00:01:02.760> just<00:01:03.180> for

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
pretty much you just need them just for

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.029 
pretty much you just need them just for
like<00:01:03.720> certain<00:01:04.080> situations<00:01:04.679> they<00:01:04.890> will

00:01:05.029 --> 00:01:05.039 
like certain situations they will

00:01:05.039 --> 00:01:07.490 
like certain situations they will
actually<00:01:05.189> come<00:01:05.489> in<00:01:05.579> handy<00:01:05.700> so<00:01:06.170> just<00:01:07.170> classes

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
actually come in handy so just classes

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.169 
actually come in handy so just classes
that<00:01:07.619> you<00:01:07.770> should<00:01:07.979> have<00:01:08.100> if<00:01:08.280> you<00:01:08.460> want<00:01:08.909> to<00:01:09.030> make

00:01:09.169 --> 00:01:09.179 
that you should have if you want to make

00:01:09.179 --> 00:01:10.999 
that you should have if you want to make
team<00:01:09.390> deathmatch<00:01:09.600> your<00:01:09.990> primary<00:01:10.530> game-mode

00:01:10.999 --> 00:01:11.009 
team deathmatch your primary game-mode

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:13.069 
team deathmatch your primary game-mode
but<00:01:11.820> the<00:01:11.909> first<00:01:12.060> class<00:01:12.299> that<00:01:12.329> we<00:01:12.570> have<00:01:12.719> is<00:01:12.899> the

00:01:13.069 --> 00:01:13.079 
but the first class that we have is the

00:01:13.079 --> 00:01:15.410 
but the first class that we have is the
submachine<00:01:13.560> gun<00:01:13.770> class<00:01:14.039> and<00:01:14.310> the<00:01:15.240> best

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
submachine gun class and the best

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.480 
submachine gun class and the best
submachine<00:01:15.869> gun<00:01:15.990> in<00:01:16.079> the<00:01:16.170> game<00:01:16.320> is<00:01:16.560> the<00:01:16.859> MSMC

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
submachine gun in the game is the MSMC

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.999 
submachine gun in the game is the MSMC
obviously<00:01:18.270> it's<00:01:19.049> still<00:01:19.289> what<00:01:19.469> everyone

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
obviously it's still what everyone

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.709 
obviously it's still what everyone
pretty<00:01:20.219> much<00:01:20.429> uses<00:01:20.789> when<00:01:20.969> they<00:01:20.999> want<00:01:21.329> to<00:01:21.450> try

00:01:21.709 --> 00:01:21.719 
pretty much uses when they want to try

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:24.830 
pretty much uses when they want to try
out<00:01:21.899> it's<00:01:22.079> what<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:22.439> MLG<00:01:22.979> players<00:01:23.429> use<00:01:23.810> but<00:01:24.810> I

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
out it's what the MLG players use but I

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.419 
out it's what the MLG players use but I
have<00:01:25.020> the<00:01:25.170> quick<00:01:25.409> draw<00:01:25.649> on<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:25.829> extended<00:01:26.249> clip

00:01:26.419 --> 00:01:26.429 
have the quick draw on the extended clip

00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:27.590 
have the quick draw on the extended clip
on<00:01:26.609> it

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
on it

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:28.880 
on it
the<00:01:27.899> extended<00:01:28.200> clip<00:01:28.350> just<00:01:28.469> because<00:01:28.770> the

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
the extended clip just because the

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.550 
the extended clip just because the
spawns<00:01:29.249> flip<00:01:29.579> so<00:01:29.759> much<00:01:29.939> in<00:01:30.119> the<00:01:30.210> quick-draw

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560 
spawns flip so much in the quick-draw

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.719 
spawns flip so much in the quick-draw
because<00:01:31.560> it's<00:01:31.710> a<00:01:31.770> submachine<00:01:32.219> gun<00:01:32.369> you<00:01:32.549> want

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
because it's a submachine gun you want

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.910 
because it's a submachine gun you want
to<00:01:32.939> be<00:01:33.090> able<00:01:33.210> to<00:01:33.390> aim<00:01:34.049> down<00:01:34.380> sight<00:01:34.679> pretty

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
to be able to aim down sight pretty

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.190 
to be able to aim down sight pretty
quick<00:01:35.159> to<00:01:35.310> when<00:01:35.429> you're<00:01:35.579> going<00:01:35.609> fights<00:01:36.200> and

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
quick to when you're going fights and

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.380 
quick to when you're going fights and
since<00:01:37.740> we're<00:01:37.829> playing<00:01:37.920> TDM<00:01:38.399> hardline<00:01:38.909> is<00:01:39.149> a

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
since we're playing TDM hardline is a

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.219 
since we're playing TDM hardline is a
necessary<00:01:39.719> perk<00:01:40.350> at<00:01:40.590> least<00:01:40.799> in<00:01:40.979> my<00:01:41.100> opinion

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:42.229 
necessary perk at least in my opinion

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:44.690 
necessary perk at least in my opinion
blind<00:01:43.229> die<00:01:43.439> and<00:01:43.740> stuff<00:01:43.950> like<00:01:44.130> that<00:01:44.399> they're

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
blind die and stuff like that they're

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.580 
blind die and stuff like that they're
just<00:01:44.729> not<00:01:45.090> that<00:01:45.270> useful<00:01:45.509> ghost<00:01:45.960> is<00:01:46.170> not<00:01:46.350> useful

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
just not that useful ghost is not useful

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.739 
just not that useful ghost is not useful
and<00:01:47.009> I<00:01:47.429> don't<00:01:47.639> find<00:01:47.939> flak<00:01:48.270> jacket<00:01:48.600> to<00:01:48.659> be

00:01:48.739 --> 00:01:48.749 
and I don't find flak jacket to be

00:01:48.749 --> 00:01:50.359 
and I don't find flak jacket to be

these<00:03:25.980> guns<00:03:26.220> are<00:03:26.370> viable<00:03:26.579> choices<00:03:27.260> but<00:03:28.260> my

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.100 
these guns are viable choices but my

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:30.770 
these guns are viable choices but my
personal<00:03:29.400> favorite<00:03:29.730> is<00:03:29.790> the<00:03:29.910> type<00:03:30.090> 25<00:03:30.510> so<00:03:30.750> that

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
personal favorite is the type 25 so that

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:32.120 
personal favorite is the type 25 so that
is<00:03:30.959> the<00:03:31.049> gun<00:03:31.170> that<00:03:31.320> I'm<00:03:31.410> going<00:03:31.620> to<00:03:31.650> choose<00:03:31.859> for

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
is the gun that I'm going to choose for

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:34.580 
is the gun that I'm going to choose for
this<00:03:32.190> example<00:03:32.609> now<00:03:33.239> on<00:03:33.390> every<00:03:33.870> assault<00:03:34.200> rifle

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
this example now on every assault rifle

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:37.960 
this example now on every assault rifle
you<00:03:34.709> want<00:03:35.040> to<00:03:35.280> run<00:03:35.579> stock<00:03:36.049> mobility<00:03:37.049> is<00:03:37.200> very

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:37.970 
you want to run stock mobility is very

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:40.130 
you want to run stock mobility is very
important<00:03:38.970> when<00:03:39.120> using<00:03:39.269> assault<00:03:39.810> rifle

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.140 
important when using assault rifle

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:41.990 
important when using assault rifle
because<00:03:40.260> you<00:03:41.190> don't<00:03:41.579> have<00:03:41.730> that<00:03:41.910> much

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
because you don't have that much

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.030 
because you don't have that much
mobility<00:03:42.180> when<00:03:42.660> you<00:03:42.810> don't<00:03:43.200> have<00:03:43.380> a<00:03:43.440> stock<00:03:43.769> so

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
mobility when you don't have a stock so

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:45.560 
mobility when you don't have a stock so
when<00:03:44.310> your<00:03:44.430> aim<00:03:44.549> down<00:03:44.700> sight<00:03:45.030> you<00:03:45.209> want<00:03:45.390> to<00:03:45.480> be

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:45.570 
when your aim down sight you want to be

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:47.270 
when your aim down sight you want to be
able<00:03:45.660> to<00:03:45.780> use<00:03:45.930> that<00:03:46.140> so<00:03:46.320> you<00:03:46.410> can<00:03:46.560> keep<00:03:46.769> moving

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
able to use that so you can keep moving

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.160 
able to use that so you can keep moving
and<00:03:47.430> you<00:03:47.910> will<00:03:48.030> actually<00:03:48.390> win<00:03:48.540> more<00:03:48.690> gunfights

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:49.170 
and you will actually win more gunfights

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:52.370 
and you will actually win more gunfights
so<00:03:49.440> it<00:03:49.709> is<00:03:50.100> very<00:03:50.370> handy<00:03:51.030> now<00:03:51.630> the<00:03:51.690> suppressor

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:52.380

Sall rifles generally get beat by

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:46.370 
Sall rifles generally get beat by
submachine<00:04:45.480> guns<00:04:45.690> which<00:04:45.840> is<00:04:45.990> the<00:04:46.110> way<00:04:46.230> it's

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:46.380 
submachine guns which is the way it's

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:49.520 
submachine guns which is the way it's
supposed<00:04:46.410> to<00:04:46.800> be<00:04:47.010> but<00:04:48.000> the<00:04:48.120> kap-40<00:04:48.600> generally

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:49.530 
supposed to be but the kap-40 generally

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:51.290 
supposed to be but the kap-40 generally
beats<00:04:49.770> submachine<00:04:50.340> guns<00:04:50.490> close<00:04:50.760> range<00:04:51.060> so<00:04:51.270> I

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:51.300 
beats submachine guns close range so I

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:53.120 
beats submachine guns close range so I
really<00:04:51.780> really<00:04:51.900> do<00:04:52.140> recommend<00:04:52.440> that<00:04:52.650> or<00:04:52.980> the

really really do recommend that or the
b23r<00:04:53.790> and<00:04:54.380> the<00:04:55.380> other<00:04:55.500> stuff<00:04:55.770> is<00:04:55.920> just<00:04:56.300> the

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:57.300 
b23r and the other stuff is just the

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:59.570 
b23r and the other stuff is just the
same<00:04:57.510> as<00:04:57.570> just<00:04:57.900> what<00:04:58.020> I<00:04:58.050> explained<00:04:58.530> before<00:04:58.590> so

00:04:59.570 --> 00:04:59.580 
same as just what I explained before so

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:01.700 
same as just what I explained before so
let's<00:04:59.730> move<00:04:59.910> on<00:05:00.120> to<00:05:00.390> the<00:05:00.570> Usain<00:05:01.020> Bolt<00:05:01.350> class

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:01.710 
let's move on to the Usain Bolt class

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:04.400 
let's move on to the Usain Bolt class
which<00:05:02.040> is<00:05:02.250> our<00:05:02.460> Russian<00:05:03.030> class<00:05:03.240> and<00:05:03.600> for<00:05:04.320> my

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:04.410 
which is our Russian class and for my

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:06.110 
which is our Russian class and for my
Russian<00:05:04.590> class<00:05:04.920> I<00:05:05.130> always<00:05:05.490> like<00:05:05.610> to<00:05:05.640> use<00:05:05.790> the

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:06.120 
Russian class I always like to use the

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:09.050 
Russian class I always like to use the
PDW<00:05:06.750> with<00:05:06.900> a<00:05:06.930> quick-draw<00:05:07.380> handle<00:05:08.060> just

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:09.060 
PDW with a quick-draw handle just

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:12.980 
PDW with a quick-draw handle just
because<00:05:09.330> the<00:05:09.420> PDW<00:05:09.990> has<00:05:10.260> a<00:05:11.030> 50<00:05:12.030> round<00:05:12.300> clip<00:05:12.750> or

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:12.990 
because the PDW has a 50 round clip or

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:33.000 
this class and I don't tend to run a

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.070 
this class and I don't tend to run a
secondary<00:05:33.390> just<00:05:33.600> because<00:05:33.780> I<00:05:33.840> don't<00:05:33.990> have

enough points and I feel that the lethal
c4<00:05:36.660> is<00:05:36.930> a<00:05:37.730> necessity<00:05:38.730> and<00:05:39.350> that's<00:05:40.350> why<00:05:40.470> we're

faster and lock-on faster so there that
is<00:07:45.800> but<00:07:46.070> these<00:07:46.310> are<00:07:46.370> my<00:07:46.910> 5<00:07:47.530> recommended<00:07:48.530> best

00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:48.830 
is but these are my 5 recommended best

00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:51.700 
is but these are my 5 recommended best
classes<00:07:49.430> for<00:07:49.790> team<00:07:50.210> deathmatch<00:07:50.450> and<00:07:50.990> like<00:07:51.590> I

00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:51.710 
classes for team deathmatch and like I

00:07:51.710 --> 00:07:53.500 
classes for team deathmatch and like I
said<00:07:51.890> you<00:07:52.070> can<00:07:52.370> change<00:07:52.910> these<00:07:53.150> around<00:07:53.450> a

00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:53.510 
said you can change these around a

00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:54.580 
said you can change these around a
little<00:07:53.600> bit<00:07:53.810> and<00:07:53.990> it<00:07:54.110> still<00:07:54.380> will<00:07:54.560> be

00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:54.590 
little bit and it still will be

00:07:54.590 --> 00:07:58.120 
little bit and it still will be
effective<00:07:55.130> so<00:07:55.400> I<00:07:55.960> hope<00:07:56.960> this<00:07:57.140> did<00:07:57.350> help<00:07:57.500> I<00:07:57.770> did
