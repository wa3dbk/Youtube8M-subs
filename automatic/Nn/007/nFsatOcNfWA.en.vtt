so if you're in the snow areas or water

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:12.640 
so if you're in the snow areas or water
mud<00:02:10.009> it<00:02:10.970> hopefully<00:02:11.360> will<00:02:11.660> stay<00:02:11.990> somewhat<00:02:12.440> in

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
mud it hopefully will stay somewhat in

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.809 
mud it hopefully will stay somewhat in
this<00:02:12.920> floor<00:02:13.160> mat<00:02:13.370> and<00:02:13.610> not<00:02:13.819> go<00:02:14.000> on<00:02:14.030> your<00:02:14.150> carpet

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
the passenger sides a little bit

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:24.960

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
as you can see there that's like

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:30.160 
as you can see there that's like
straight<00:02:27.590> up<00:02:27.709> like<00:02:28.160> a<00:02:28.190> square<00:02:28.900> and<00:02:29.900> this<00:02:29.989> one

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
straight up like a square and this one

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:32.650 
straight up like a square and this one
has<00:02:30.260> a<00:02:30.290> little<00:02:30.530> bit<00:02:30.620> different<00:02:30.830> shape<00:02:31.450> both<00:02:32.450> of

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
has a little bit different shape both of

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.560 
has a little bit different shape both of
the<00:02:32.750> front<00:02:32.989> ones<00:02:33.170> say<00:02:33.440> focus<00:02:34.120> so<00:02:35.120> that's<00:02:35.330> nice

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:35.570 
the front ones say focus so that's nice

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:41.170 
the front ones say focus so that's nice
and<00:02:36.370> then<00:02:37.370> the<00:02:37.489> rears<00:02:37.760> I<00:02:39.730> believe<00:02:40.730> are<00:02:41.120> a

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
and then the rears I believe are a

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:50.680 
and then the rears I believe are a
little<00:02:41.420> bit<00:02:41.630> bigger<00:02:43.630> than<00:02:44.630> the<00:02:44.870> stocks<00:02:46.330> yes<00:02:49.690> so

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:50.690 
little bit bigger than the stocks yes so

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:54.729 
little bit bigger than the stocks yes so
the<00:02:50.870> the<00:02:51.440> backs<00:02:51.650> also<00:02:52.130> have<00:02:52.310> a<00:02:52.340> lip<00:02:53.380> to<00:02:54.380> hold<00:02:54.560> in

00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:54.739 
the the backs also have a lip to hold in

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:58.660 
the the backs also have a lip to hold in
water<00:02:55.010> and<00:02:55.420> they're<00:02:56.420> about<00:02:57.310> two<00:02:58.310> inches

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
water and they're about two inches

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:01.540 
water and they're about two inches
taller<00:02:59.530> all<00:03:00.530> right<00:03:00.709> finally<00:03:01.130> these<00:03:01.280> are<00:03:01.340> the

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:01.550 
taller all right finally these are the

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:06.150 
taller all right finally these are the
