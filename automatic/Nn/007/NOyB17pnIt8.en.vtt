00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
you want to keep repeating this method

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.020 
you want to keep repeating this method
so<00:00:49.530> once<00:00:49.980> you<00:00:50.070> get<00:00:50.190> out<00:00:50.370> once<00:00:50.730> you<00:00:50.820> park<00:00:51.000> the

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
truck as a second Zack same position

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.229 
truck as a second Zack same position
like<00:00:52.710> i<00:00:52.890> have<00:00:53.100> just<00:00:53.280> lining<00:00:53.520> up<00:00:53.730> with<00:00:53.879> a<00:00:53.910> middle

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
like i have just lining up with a middle

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:55.760 
like i have just lining up with a middle
and<00:00:54.360> everything<00:00:55.230> is<00:00:55.379> in<00:00:55.559> the<00:00:55.649> correct
