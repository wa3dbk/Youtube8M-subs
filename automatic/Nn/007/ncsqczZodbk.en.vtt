doubt<00:02:07.399> Tyson<00:02:08.399> Frizell

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:16.910 

um<00:02:12.480> it's<00:02:13.250> again<00:02:14.250> it's<00:02:15.500> has<00:02:16.500> he<00:02:16.590> got<00:02:16.710> the<00:02:16.770> same

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
um it's again it's has he got the same

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.820 
um it's again it's has he got the same
time<00:02:17.130> as<00:02:17.250> Marshall<00:02:18.470> now<00:02:19.470> it's<00:02:19.620> a<00:02:19.680> bit

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
time as Marshall now it's a bit

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.680 
time as Marshall now it's a bit
different<00:02:19.980> it's<00:02:20.700> not<00:02:20.850> alike<00:02:21.120> the<00:02:21.240> marshal<00:02:21.600> one

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
different it's not alike the marshal one

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.930 
different it's not alike the marshal one
though<00:02:21.870> it's<00:02:22.320> okay<00:02:22.890> but<00:02:23.190> not<00:02:23.340> outstanding

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
though it's okay but not outstanding

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:27.530 
though it's okay but not outstanding
it's<00:02:24.450> pretty<00:02:24.630> good<00:02:24.800> it's<00:02:25.800> pretty<00:02:25.980> good<00:02:26.540> then

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
it's pretty good it's pretty good then

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.650 
it's pretty good it's pretty good then
mid<00:02:27.750> train<00:02:28.020> and<00:02:28.260> I'll<00:02:29.070> mid-range<00:02:29.550> someone<00:02:29.970> the

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
mid train and I'll mid-range someone the

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.420 
mid train and I'll mid-range someone the
likeness<00:02:31.080> is<00:02:31.200> really<00:02:31.440> good<00:02:31.620> but<00:02:31.770> the<00:02:32.040> ratings

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
likeness is really good but the ratings

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.520 
likeness is really good but the ratings
I've<00:02:32.850> pretty<00:02:33.120> sure<00:02:33.330> Mitch<00:02:33.540> rein<00:02:33.780> was<00:02:34.020> rated<00:02:34.380> on

I've pretty sure Mitch rein was rated on

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.000 
I've pretty sure Mitch rein was rated on
90<00:02:35.060> before<00:02:36.060> the<00:02:36.180> update<00:02:36.330> so<00:02:36.870> they've<00:02:37.650> toned<00:02:37.860> a

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
90 before the update so they've toned a

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:39.620 
90 before the update so they've toned a
lot<00:02:38.160> of<00:02:38.280> players<00:02:38.520> who<00:02:38.850> are<00:02:39.030> way<00:02:39.240> overrated
