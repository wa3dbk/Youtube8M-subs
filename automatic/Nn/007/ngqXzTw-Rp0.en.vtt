00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:23.410
 problem and it's going great as a mask 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:25.900
 eyelashes I recommend this one of katrin 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:29.440
 that is called the sixth who and that is that 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:32.139
 some microfibers that make us have 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:34.990
 more lashes more volume and good is left

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:40.889
 happy with this one 

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:46.440
 that the little things after the blusher 

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:49.590
 up mahal that I forgot to take it out in the 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:52.820
 another video and it's a rouge besides and it's 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:56.130
 the low in orange and golden is left 

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:58.380
 fantastic with sun powder and one or 

00:04:56.130 --> 00:05:00.450
 just eating as much as the cactus 

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:03.360
 flower that you also know is one of 

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:07.230
 my favorites for summer plus little things 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:08.760
 good shadows in cream good I would 

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:11.870
 love is not for less as to 

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:15.210
 summer but students are now 

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:16.320
 cream shadows of a benefit 

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:20.490
 another of mch 

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:24.630

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:27.990
 super easy work we'll summarize you can 

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:30.650
 correct them if you pass is a wonder 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:33.740
 of shadows in cream of venice 

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:35.570
 another that I like is the constructive and 

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:38.360
 is that the one that took the survey is a 

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:41.300
 little darker than the other and less 

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:44.120
 golden and also less fantastic is a 

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:47.990
 mac paper and I also like them a lot 

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:49.669

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:52.160

00:05:49.669 --> 00:05:54.620
 which is the first in the bronze tone of 

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:56.449
 kiko and he used it then to contour 

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:58.490
 over here because it looks dark and 

00:05:56.449 --> 00:06:00.770
 golden and it looks super nice too 

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:05.030
 I throw a little bit here under the 

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:08.419

 first for eyes in delray that is the 

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:21.940
 tone in the rest of makeup is a 

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:24.080
 tone then to see if I can teach it 

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:26.689
 A) Yes 

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:29.270

00:06:31.909 --> 00:06:37.540
