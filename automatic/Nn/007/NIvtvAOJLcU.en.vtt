remember that this one was 8 - 1 and

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.899 
remember that this one was 8 - 1 and
then<00:01:15.420> this<00:01:15.630> should<00:01:15.869> be<00:01:16.229> the<00:01:16.799> same<00:01:17.040> number<00:01:17.280> 8<00:01:17.610> -

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:22.370 
then this should be the same number 8 -
1<00:01:18.180> and<00:01:18.689> then<00:01:19.350> all<00:01:19.680> you<00:01:19.950> do<00:01:20.220> here<00:01:20.820> is<00:01:21.210> go<00:01:21.840> save

and then save as and then it goes

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.600 
and then save as and then it goes
directly<00:01:29.520> to<00:01:29.820> where<00:01:30.119> we<00:01:30.890> saved<00:01:31.890> some<00:01:32.040> some

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610

folder and then we're gonna save it as 8
-<00:01:40.500> 1<00:01:40.950> I<00:01:41.009> think<00:01:41.189> you<00:01:41.430> could<00:01:41.610> see<00:01:41.820> that<00:01:42.000> there<00:01:42.360> so

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
- 1 I think you could see that there so

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.889 
- 1 I think you could see that there so
we're<00:01:43.439> just<00:01:43.470> gonna<00:01:43.649> make<00:01:43.770> sure<00:01:44.390> let<00:01:45.390> me<00:01:45.479> scroll

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
we're just gonna make sure let me scroll

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.109 
we're just gonna make sure let me scroll
down<00:01:45.960> a<00:01:46.140> little<00:01:46.500> bit<00:01:46.710> that<00:01:47.430> we<00:01:47.520> don't<00:01:47.700> have<00:01:47.909> any

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
down a little bit that we don't have any

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.630 
down a little bit that we don't have any
other<00:01:48.329> 8<00:01:48.659> -<00:01:49.020> ones

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:51.640 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.470 

look<00:01:52.540> here<00:01:52.840> in<00:01:52.930> it<00:01:53.050> looks<00:01:53.470> like<00:01:53.710> we<00:01:53.920> do<00:01:54.490> so<00:01:55.300> if

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:55.480 
look here in it looks like we do so if

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:58.530 
look here in it looks like we do so if
we<00:01:55.690> have<00:01:56.020> that<00:01:56.350> happening<00:01:57.040> what<00:01:58.000> we<00:01:58.180> want<00:01:58.420> to

00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:58.540 
we have that happening what we want to

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:01.740 
we have that happening what we want to
do<00:01:58.720> is<00:01:59.020> just<00:01:59.410> put<00:02:00.190> an<00:02:00.310> A<00:02:00.580> in<00:02:00.820> front<00:02:01.060> of<00:02:01.210> this<00:02:01.360> so

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:01.750 
do is just put an A in front of this so

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:04.800 
do is just put an A in front of this so
it<00:02:01.960> differentiates<00:02:02.620> from<00:02:03.310> the<00:02:03.880> other<00:02:04.000> file<00:02:04.540> we

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:04.810 
it differentiates from the other file we

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:07.320 
it differentiates from the other file we
don't<00:02:05.020> want<00:02:05.200> to<00:02:05.470> replace<00:02:05.980> an<00:02:06.280> or<00:02:06.610> any<00:02:06.820> existing

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:07.330 
don't want to replace an or any existing

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:10.080 
don't want to replace an or any existing
picture<00:02:07.750> that's<00:02:08.020> a<00:02:08.170> different<00:02:08.470> picture<00:02:09.090> so

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.090 
picture that's a different picture so

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:15.990 
picture that's a different picture so
then<00:02:10.330> we<00:02:10.990> just<00:02:11.020> go<00:02:11.500> in<00:02:11.800> and<00:02:11.980> go<00:02:12.190> save<00:02:14.580> so<00:02:15.580> let<00:02:15.820> me

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
then we just go in and go save so let me

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.670 
then we just go in and go save so let me
just<00:02:16.180> go<00:02:16.360> back<00:02:16.540> to<00:02:16.780> the<00:02:16.870> same<00:02:17.110> thing<00:02:17.440> when<00:02:17.650> we

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
just go back to the same thing when we

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.400 
just go back to the same thing when we
go<00:02:17.950> download<00:02:18.570> and<00:02:19.570> see<00:02:19.750> where<00:02:19.870> it<00:02:19.960> says<00:02:20.110> nine

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
go download and see where it says nine

save it as nine underscore two so we

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:49.380 
save it as nine underscore two so we
just<00:02:46.170> go<00:02:47.170> along<00:02:47.500> where<00:02:48.070> we've<00:02:48.220> got<00:02:48.400> the<00:02:48.580> nine<00:02:48.880> -

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:49.390 
just go along where we've got the nine -

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:51.449 
just go along where we've got the nine -
-<00:02:49.780> so<00:02:49.930> there's<00:02:50.260> no<00:02:50.410> nine<00:02:50.650> so<00:02:50.920> you<00:02:51.010> can<00:02:51.160> just<00:02:51.280> go

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:14.709 
to ten underscore three and then we just

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:17.960 
to ten underscore three and then we just
go<00:03:14.920> save

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970
