light that's not in here now these are
laying<00:00:25.890> here<00:00:26.130> they<00:00:26.369> broke<00:00:26.609> off<00:00:26.820> the<00:00:27.000> plants

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
laying here they broke off the plants

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.679 
laying here they broke off the plants
when<00:00:27.510> they<00:00:27.630> fell<00:00:27.810> over<00:00:28.130> and<00:00:29.390> none<00:00:30.390> of<00:00:30.420> them

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
when they fell over and none of them

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.780 
when they fell over and none of them
rooted<00:00:31.230> because<00:00:31.710> they<00:00:32.009> weren't<00:00:32.219> stuck<00:00:32.520> in<00:00:32.700> the

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
rooted because they weren't stuck in the

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.450 
rooted because they weren't stuck in the
ground<00:00:32.969> now<00:00:33.930> if<00:00:34.200> I<00:00:34.350> had<00:00:34.559> sucked<00:00:34.920> every<00:00:35.250> one<00:00:35.430> of

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
ground now if I had sucked every one of

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.500 
ground now if I had sucked every one of
those<00:00:35.760> in<00:00:36.149> the<00:00:36.270> ground<00:00:36.559> they<00:00:37.559> would<00:00:37.829> be<00:00:38.010> all

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:38.510 
those in the ground they would be all

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:42.020 
those in the ground they would be all
rooted<00:00:39.510> and<00:00:40.010> sending<00:00:41.010> up<00:00:41.160> little<00:00:41.550> new<00:00:41.730> leaves

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
rooted and sending up little new leaves

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.650 
rooted and sending up little new leaves
right<00:00:42.629> there<00:00:43.070> now<00:00:44.070> this<00:00:44.399> one<00:00:44.700> fell<00:00:45.450> off<00:00:45.480> a

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
right there now this one fell off a

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.420 
right there now this one fell off a
branch<00:00:46.219> it<00:00:47.219> didn't<00:00:47.789> root<00:00:49.039> because<00:00:50.039> it<00:00:50.160> wasn't

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
branch it didn't root because it wasn't

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:51.260 
branch it didn't root because it wasn't
stuck<00:00:50.579> in<00:00:50.730> the<00:00:50.820> ground

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
stuck in the ground

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.959 
stuck in the ground
but<00:00:51.899> see<00:00:52.110> it's<00:00:52.350> trying<00:00:52.890> to<00:00:53.190> root<00:00:53.430> out<00:00:53.610> of<00:00:53.789> that

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
but see it's trying to root out of that

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.709 
but see it's trying to root out of that
joint<00:00:55.039> it<00:00:56.039> was<00:00:56.250> laying<00:00:56.489> like<00:00:56.760> that<00:00:56.789> I<00:00:57.270> picked

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
joint it was laying like that I picked

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.420 
joint it was laying like that I picked
it<00:00:57.870> up<00:00:57.989> I<00:00:58.199> said<00:00:58.410> I<00:00:58.530> got<00:00:58.710> to<00:00:58.739> show<00:00:58.949> people<00:00:59.160> it's

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
lay that and let that little root come

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.359

the hole you really must stick those

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.460 
the hole you really must stick those
roots<00:01:11.939> in<00:01:12.119> there<00:01:12.299> just<00:01:12.510> stick<00:01:12.750> that<00:01:12.780> into<00:01:13.200> the

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
fresh wood they're easy to grow you just

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.119 
fresh wood they're easy to grow you just
have<00:02:06.840> to<00:02:06.990> put<00:02:07.170> them<00:02:07.259> in<00:02:07.350> contact<00:02:07.770> with<00:02:08.009> the

slow<00:03:04.049> going<00:03:04.410> you<00:03:04.530> don't<00:03:04.620> have<00:03:04.769> to<00:03:04.859> worry<00:03:05.010> about

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
slow going you don't have to worry about

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:06.710 
slow going you don't have to worry about
them<00:03:05.400> they<00:03:05.579> don't<00:03:05.700> drop<00:03:06.030> real<00:03:06.359> good<00:03:06.569> because

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
them they don't drop real good because

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.089 
them they don't drop real good because
every<00:03:07.079> one<00:03:07.170> of<00:03:07.200> these<00:03:07.319> leaves<00:03:07.560> are<00:03:07.769> holding

00:03:08.089 --> 00:03:08.099 
every one of these leaves are holding

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:11.660 
every one of these leaves are holding
tons<00:03:08.519> of<00:03:08.730> water<00:03:08.989> see<00:03:09.989> it<00:03:10.079> thick<00:03:10.290> there<00:03:10.670> that's

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
tons of water see it thick there that's

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:13.220 
tons of water see it thick there that's
a<00:03:11.819> lot<00:03:11.940> of<00:03:12.000> water<00:03:12.239> in<00:03:12.450> there<00:03:12.599> so<00:03:12.810> if<00:03:12.870> you<00:03:12.989> forget

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
a lot of water in there so if you forget

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:14.960 
a lot of water in there so if you forget
to<00:03:13.290> water<00:03:13.560> it<00:03:13.739> it<00:03:13.950> just<00:03:14.160> sucks<00:03:14.430> the<00:03:14.579> water<00:03:14.730> at

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
to water it it just sucks the water at

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:17.210 
to water it it just sucks the water at
these<00:03:15.150> leaves<00:03:15.420> back<00:03:15.660> into<00:03:16.019> the<00:03:16.109> roots<00:03:16.290> then

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
these leaves back into the roots then

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:18.559 
these leaves back into the roots then
when<00:03:17.400> you<00:03:17.519> think<00:03:17.760> the<00:03:17.819> squirt<00:03:18.030> water<00:03:18.269> and<00:03:18.480> it

00:03:18.559 --> 00:03:18.569 
when you think the squirt water and it

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:20.420 
when you think the squirt water and it
throws<00:03:18.810> the<00:03:18.930> water<00:03:19.169> on<00:03:19.349> it<00:03:19.500> the<00:03:19.950> leaves<00:03:20.190> fell

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
throws the water on it the leaves fell

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:23.690 
throws the water on it the leaves fell
back<00:03:20.609> up<00:03:20.849> so<00:03:21.329> it<00:03:21.450> gives<00:03:21.690> you<00:03:21.870> 2<00:03:22.590> 2<00:03:23.160> weeks<00:03:23.400> 3

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
back up so it gives you 2 2 weeks 3

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.599 
back up so it gives you 2 2 weeks 3
weeks<00:03:23.940> leeway<00:03:24.329> on<00:03:24.359> when<00:03:24.690> you<00:03:24.810> water<00:03:25.609> anyway

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:26.609 
weeks leeway on when you water anyway

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:29.479 
weeks leeway on when you water anyway
that's<00:03:26.849> all<00:03:27.030> I<00:03:27.060> got<00:03:27.299> sober<00:03:27.569> and<00:03:27.780> amaryllis<00:03:28.489> see

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.489 
that's all I got sober and amaryllis see

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:34.150 
that's all I got sober and amaryllis see

tape around it just to hold the heat to

00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:12.800 
tape around it just to hold the heat to
it<00:05:10.379> and<00:05:10.529> this<00:05:11.370> is<00:05:11.550> all<00:05:11.729> vermiculite<00:05:12.330> that's

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:12.810 
it and this is all vermiculite that's

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:16.550 
it and this is all vermiculite that's
been<00:05:13.020> here<00:05:13.229> forever<00:05:13.469> and<00:05:14.150> I've<00:05:15.150> wet<00:05:15.990> that<00:05:16.229> down

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:16.560 
been here forever and I've wet that down

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:19.010 
been here forever and I've wet that down
and<00:05:16.979> plug<00:05:17.460> this<00:05:17.639> in<00:05:17.939> and<00:05:18.210> get<00:05:18.330> it<00:05:18.479> level<00:05:18.839> and

and plug this in and get it level and

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:21.490 
and plug this in and get it level and
that's<00:05:19.740> where<00:05:19.949> my<00:05:20.129> plants<00:05:20.490> grow<00:05:20.669> under<00:05:21.089> light

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:21.500 
that's where my plants grow under light

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:24.649 
that's where my plants grow under light
okay<00:05:22.500> we're<00:05:22.710> going<00:05:22.800> to<00:05:22.860> pull<00:05:23.069> this<00:05:23.279> up<00:05:23.659> and

00:05:24.649 --> 00:05:24.659 
okay we're going to pull this up and

00:05:24.659 --> 00:05:27.140 
okay we're going to pull this up and
that's<00:05:24.810> how<00:05:25.050> many<00:05:25.259> roots<00:05:25.650> are<00:05:25.860> on<00:05:26.009> it<00:05:26.189> so<00:05:26.849> I'm

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:27.150 
that's how many roots are on it so I'm

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:30.339 
that's how many roots are on it so I'm
going<00:05:27.449> to<00:05:27.509> bury<00:05:27.779> that<00:05:28.050> just<00:05:28.379> like<00:05:28.589> that<00:05:28.889> I

00:05:30.339 --> 00:05:30.349 
going to bury that just like that I

00:05:30.349 --> 00:05:33.439 
going to bury that just like that I
might<00:05:31.349> even<00:05:31.529> bare<00:05:31.860> it<00:05:31.949> on<00:05:32.129> a<00:05:32.159> slight<00:05:32.490> angle<00:05:32.759> but

00:05:33.439 --> 00:05:33.449 
might even bare it on a slight angle but

00:05:33.449 --> 00:05:36.439 
might even bare it on a slight angle but
that<00:05:33.689> will<00:05:33.900> be<00:05:33.930> in<00:05:34.080> in<00:05:34.379> that<00:05:35.129> pot<00:05:35.400> and<00:05:36.270> now

00:05:36.439 --> 00:05:36.449 
that will be in in that pot and now

00:05:36.449 --> 00:05:37.969 
that will be in in that pot and now
we'll<00:05:36.629> get<00:05:36.810> some<00:05:37.080> leaves<00:05:37.349> and<00:05:37.650> put<00:05:37.800> in<00:05:37.919> that

00:05:37.969 --> 00:05:37.979 
we'll get some leaves and put in that

00:05:37.979 --> 00:05:41.179 
we'll get some leaves and put in that
pot<00:05:38.400> and<00:05:38.779> I'm<00:05:39.779> sure<00:05:39.990> I<00:05:40.020> can<00:05:40.259> find<00:05:40.439> another<00:05:40.860> stem

00:05:41.179 --> 00:05:41.189 
pot and I'm sure I can find another stem

00:05:41.189 --> 00:05:43.249 
pot and I'm sure I can find another stem
that's<00:05:41.400> broken<00:05:41.849> off<00:05:41.969> to<00:05:42.120> put<00:05:42.270> in<00:05:42.389> that<00:05:42.569> pot<00:05:42.779> and

00:05:43.249 --> 00:05:43.259 
that's broken off to put in that pot and

00:05:43.259 --> 00:05:45.110 
that's broken off to put in that pot and
then<00:05:43.740> what<00:05:43.979> we'll<00:05:44.189> do<00:05:44.399> is<00:05:44.580> I'll<00:05:44.699> just<00:05:44.759> make

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:45.120 
then what we'll do is I'll just make

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:46.850 
then what we'll do is I'll just make
updates<00:05:45.539> to<00:05:45.750> show<00:05:45.960> you<00:05:46.020> how<00:05:46.289> long<00:05:46.469> it<00:05:46.649> takes

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:46.860 
updates to show you how long it takes

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:50.059 
updates to show you how long it takes
for<00:05:46.949> the<00:05:47.219> leaves<00:05:47.430> to<00:05:48.300> start<00:05:48.839> sprouting<00:05:49.349> the

00:05:50.059 --> 00:05:50.069 
for the leaves to start sprouting the

00:05:50.069 --> 00:05:52.939 
for the leaves to start sprouting the
new<00:05:50.219> leaves<00:05:50.539> around<00:05:51.539> the<00:05:51.719> just<00:05:52.469> the<00:05:52.589> leaf<00:05:52.770> in

00:05:52.939 --> 00:05:52.949 
new leaves around the just the leaf in

00:05:52.949 --> 00:05:55.820 
new leaves around the just the leaf in
the<00:05:53.099> soil<00:05:53.339> and<00:05:53.580> today<00:05:54.509> is<00:05:54.779> February<00:05:55.259> the<00:05:55.319> 14th

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:55.830 
the soil and today is February the 14th

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:59.300 
the soil and today is February the 14th
I<00:05:56.810> found<00:05:57.810> another<00:05:58.199> one<00:05:58.409> that<00:05:58.589> had<00:05:58.740> broken<00:05:59.009> off

00:05:59.300 --> 00:05:59.310 
I found another one that had broken off

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:01.249 
I found another one that had broken off
when<00:05:59.550> I<00:05:59.699> moved<00:05:59.939> these<00:06:00.149> plants<00:06:00.689> when<00:06:00.870> I<00:06:00.899> stood

00:06:01.249 --> 00:06:01.259 
when I moved these plants when I stood

00:06:01.259 --> 00:06:06.679 
when I moved these plants when I stood
these<00:06:01.469> up<00:06:01.939> I<00:06:04.099> planted<00:06:05.099> this<00:06:05.310> one<00:06:05.580> that's<00:06:06.360> the

00:06:06.679 --> 00:06:06.689 
these up I planted this one that's the

00:06:06.689 --> 00:06:10.309 
these up I planted this one that's the
non<00:06:07.199> variegated<00:06:07.969> spider<00:06:08.969> plant<00:06:09.270> that's<00:06:10.080> one

00:06:10.309 --> 00:06:10.319 
non variegated spider plant that's one

00:06:10.319 --> 00:06:12.260 
non variegated spider plant that's one
that<00:06:10.500> had<00:06:10.740> broken<00:06:10.949> off<00:06:11.279> when<00:06:11.520> I<00:06:11.639> moved<00:06:11.849> it<00:06:12.060> so<00:06:12.240> I

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:12.270 
that had broken off when I moved it so I

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:14.420 
that had broken off when I moved it so I
stuck<00:06:12.479> it<00:06:12.629> in<00:06:12.750> the<00:06:12.810> pot<00:06:13.020> and<00:06:13.319> these<00:06:14.009> are<00:06:14.219> four

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:14.430 
stuck it in the pot and these are four

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:16.339 
stuck it in the pot and these are four
leaves<00:06:14.669> and<00:06:15.180> I<00:06:15.240> cut<00:06:15.479> it<00:06:15.569> off<00:06:15.719> with<00:06:15.750> a<00:06:15.990> fairly

00:06:16.339 --> 00:06:16.349 
leaves and I cut it off with a fairly

00:06:16.349 --> 00:06:18.619 
leaves and I cut it off with a fairly
sharp<00:06:16.529> pocketknife<00:06:17.189> and<00:06:17.460> you<00:06:18.060> can<00:06:18.270> see<00:06:18.449> where

00:06:18.619 --> 00:06:18.629 
sharp pocketknife and you can see where

00:06:18.629 --> 00:06:22.610 
sharp pocketknife and you can see where
I<00:06:18.659> cut<00:06:18.899> them<00:06:19.080> off<00:06:19.490> there<00:06:20.490> was<00:06:20.669> two<00:06:21.149> there<00:06:21.620> and

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:22.620 
I cut them off there was two there and

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:26.179 
I cut them off there was two there and
one<00:06:23.490> right<00:06:23.699> there<00:06:24.060> and<00:06:24.469> the<00:06:25.469> other<00:06:25.710> one<00:06:25.860> I

00:06:26.179 --> 00:06:26.189 
one right there and the other one I

00:06:26.189 --> 00:06:29.420 
one right there and the other one I
found<00:06:26.639> back<00:06:27.599> over<00:06:28.020> in<00:06:28.289> that<00:06:28.529> right<00:06:29.159> there

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:29.430 
found back over in that right there

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:31.070 
found back over in that right there
where<00:06:29.669> they've<00:06:29.879> broken<00:06:30.120> off<00:06:30.389> you<00:06:30.719> can<00:06:30.899> see

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:31.080 
where they've broken off you can see

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:32.360 
where they've broken off you can see
down<00:06:31.289> there<00:06:31.500> there's<00:06:31.740> some<00:06:31.919> broken<00:06:32.250> off

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:32.370 
down there there's some broken off

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:34.869 
down there there's some broken off
leaves<00:06:32.759> hopefully<00:06:33.360> there's<00:06:33.539> enough<00:06:33.930> light

00:06:34.869 --> 00:06:34.879 
leaves hopefully there's enough light

00:06:34.879 --> 00:06:37.519 
leaves hopefully there's enough light
they're<00:06:35.879> fairly<00:06:36.180> fragile<00:06:36.690> when<00:06:37.139> you<00:06:37.289> touch

00:06:37.519 --> 00:06:37.529 
they're fairly fragile when you touch

00:06:37.529 --> 00:06:39.230 
they're fairly fragile when you touch
these<00:06:37.800> things<00:06:37.860> you<00:06:38.490> can<00:06:38.699> break<00:06:38.879> the<00:06:39.029> leaves

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:39.240 
these things you can break the leaves

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:40.549 
these things you can break the leaves
off<00:06:39.449> really<00:06:39.810> quickly

00:06:40.549 --> 00:06:40.559 
off really quickly

00:06:40.559 --> 00:06:44.239 
off really quickly
and<00:06:41.779> now<00:06:42.779> all<00:06:42.989> you<00:06:43.139> have<00:06:43.259> to<00:06:43.409> do<00:06:43.559> is<00:06:43.769> a<00:06:43.799> add

00:07:13.159 --> 00:07:13.169 
watered in see how they're sitting up

00:07:13.169 --> 00:07:15.169 
watered in see how they're sitting up
away<00:07:13.349> from<00:07:13.679> the<00:07:13.829> pot<00:07:14.069> in<00:07:14.309> fact<00:07:14.609> when<00:07:14.759> I<00:07:14.789> watered

00:07:15.169 --> 00:07:15.179 
away from the pot in fact when I watered

00:07:15.179 --> 00:07:17.029 
away from the pot in fact when I watered
it<00:07:15.269> this<00:07:15.449> one<00:07:15.659> floated<00:07:16.079> up<00:07:16.229> man<00:07:16.439> to<00:07:16.559> reposition

00:07:17.029 --> 00:07:17.039 
it this one floated up man to reposition

00:07:17.039 --> 00:07:19.219 
it this one floated up man to reposition
it<00:07:17.309> and<00:07:17.459> the<00:07:17.999> new<00:07:18.179> leaves<00:07:18.479> will<00:07:18.749> will

00:07:19.219 --> 00:07:19.229 
it and the new leaves will will

00:07:19.229 --> 00:07:21.469 
it and the new leaves will will
generally<00:07:19.649> appear<00:07:19.949> right<00:07:20.189> on<00:07:20.369> the<00:07:20.519> right<00:07:21.329> at

00:07:21.469 --> 00:07:21.479 
generally appear right on the right at

00:07:21.479 --> 00:07:23.329 
generally appear right on the right at
this<00:07:21.659> little<00:07:21.959> base<00:07:22.109> on<00:07:22.439> each<00:07:22.469> one<00:07:22.799> of<00:07:22.859> them<00:07:23.069> and

this little base on each one of them and

00:07:23.339 --> 00:07:25.789 
this little base on each one of them and
it'll<00:07:23.819> they<00:07:24.419> take<00:07:24.629> a<00:07:24.659> while<00:07:24.869> to<00:07:24.899> start<00:07:25.409> growing

00:07:25.789 --> 00:07:25.799 
it'll they take a while to start growing

00:07:25.799 --> 00:07:28.969 
it'll they take a while to start growing
but<00:07:26.039> once<00:07:26.369> they<00:07:26.549> get<00:07:26.699> growing<00:07:27.799> they<00:07:28.799> come

00:07:28.969 --> 00:07:28.979 
but once they get growing they come

00:07:28.979 --> 00:07:30.649 
but once they get growing they come
along<00:07:29.159> pretty<00:07:29.399> good<00:07:29.489> for<00:07:29.849> as<00:07:29.939> big<00:07:30.149> as<00:07:30.299> they<00:07:30.419> get

00:07:30.649 --> 00:07:30.659 
along pretty good for as big as they get

00:07:30.659 --> 00:07:33.949 
along pretty good for as big as they get
