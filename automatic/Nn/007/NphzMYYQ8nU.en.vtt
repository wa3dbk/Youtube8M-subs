00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:39.120 
we have a steam fill line which is great
for<00:01:38.049> when<00:01:38.140> you're<00:01:38.229> seaming<00:01:38.590> you<00:01:38.650> know<00:01:38.770> exactly

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.130 
for when you're seaming you know exactly

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:41.070 
for when you're seaming you know exactly
how<00:01:39.280> much<00:01:39.400> water<00:01:39.670> to<00:01:39.760> put<00:01:40.000> in<00:01:40.119> there<00:01:40.330> then<00:01:40.960> you

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:41.080 
how much water to put in there then you

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:43.380 
how much water to put in there then you
may<00:01:41.200> be<00:01:41.260> able<00:01:41.409> to<00:01:41.530> see<00:01:41.710> this<00:01:41.890> ring<00:01:42.369> around<00:01:42.880> here

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:43.390 
may be able to see this ring around here

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:44.760 
may be able to see this ring around here
that<00:01:43.540> actually<00:01:43.690> is<00:01:43.930> what<00:01:44.080> the<00:01:44.260> steaming<00:01:44.619> rack

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:44.770 
that actually is what the steaming rack

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:47.010 
that actually is what the steaming rack
sets<00:01:45.400> on<00:01:45.610> so<00:01:45.880> that<00:01:46.030> makes<00:01:46.240> that<00:01:46.360> very<00:01:46.390> simple

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:47.020 
sets on so that makes that very simple

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:49.320 
sets on so that makes that very simple
and<00:01:47.229> when<00:01:47.740> you're<00:01:47.890> canning<00:01:48.159> we<00:01:48.850> actually<00:01:49.210> have

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:49.330 
and when you're canning we actually have

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:50.880 
and when you're canning we actually have
a<00:01:49.360> max<00:01:49.720> goal<00:01:49.990> line<00:01:50.170> I<00:01:50.290> don't<00:01:50.439> know<00:01:50.530> about<00:01:50.650> you

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:50.890 
a max goal line I don't know about you

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:52.469 
a max goal line I don't know about you
but<00:01:51.070> if<00:01:51.189> you've<00:01:51.310> ever<00:01:51.520> been<00:01:51.729> preserving<00:01:52.270> food

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:52.479 
but if you've ever been preserving food

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:53.969 
but if you've ever been preserving food
and<00:01:52.659> all<00:01:52.720> of<00:01:52.750> a<00:01:52.869> sudden<00:01:52.900> your<00:01:53.320> lip<00:01:53.530> starts<00:01:53.740> to

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:53.979 
and all of a sudden your lip starts to

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:55.920 
and all of a sudden your lip starts to
bounce<00:01:54.310> around<00:01:54.610> it's<00:01:55.360> probably<00:01:55.689> because<00:01:55.840> you

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:55.930 
bounce around it's probably because you

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:57.600 
bounce around it's probably because you
got<00:01:56.020> a<00:01:56.049> little<00:01:56.320> bit<00:01:56.439> too<00:01:56.619> much<00:01:56.710> water<00:01:56.979> going<00:01:57.369> on

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:57.610 
got a little bit too much water going on

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:59.560 
got a little bit too much water going on
in<00:01:57.760> there<00:01:57.909> and<00:01:57.939> it's<00:01:58.150> boiling<00:01:58.450> and

00:01:59.560 --> 00:01:59.570 
in there and it's boiling and

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:01.120 
in there and it's boiling and
now<00:01:59.630> does<00:02:00.050> happen<00:02:00.500> to<00:02:00.530> me<00:02:00.650> but<00:02:00.890> this<00:02:00.980> is<00:02:01.100> a

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.130 
now does happen to me but this is a

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:02.530 
now does happen to me but this is a
great<00:02:01.370> way<00:02:01.520> to<00:02:01.550> make<00:02:01.850> sure<00:02:01.970> you<00:02:02.060> have<00:02:02.180> just<00:02:02.420> the

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:02.540 
great way to make sure you have just the

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:04.060 
great way to make sure you have just the
right<00:02:02.570> amount<00:02:02.720> of<00:02:03.020> water<00:02:03.229> when<00:02:03.890> you're

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.070 
right amount of water when you're

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.100 
right amount of water when you're
preserving<00:02:04.479> something<00:02:05.479> else<00:02:05.630> on<00:02:05.810> the<00:02:05.990> boat

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.110 
preserving something else on the boat

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:07.630 
preserving something else on the boat
maybe<00:02:06.380> you<00:02:06.530> noticed<00:02:06.830> by<00:02:06.950> now<00:02:07.130> you<00:02:07.520> have<00:02:07.550> a

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640 
maybe you noticed by now you have a

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.359 
maybe you noticed by now you have a
spigot<00:02:07.940> on<00:02:08.270> the<00:02:08.660> side<00:02:08.899> how<00:02:09.410> awesome<00:02:09.800> is<00:02:09.920> that<00:02:09.950> I

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:10.369 
spigot on the side how awesome is that I

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:12.699 
spigot on the side how awesome is that I
know<00:02:10.820> for<00:02:11.209> me<00:02:11.480> when<00:02:11.690> I<00:02:11.720> get<00:02:11.840> done<00:02:12.200> preserving

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:12.709

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:25.400 
that full rolling boil just like if you

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.190 
that full rolling boil just like if you
were<00:03:25.459> to<00:03:25.549> do<00:03:25.640> this<00:03:25.700> on<00:03:25.880> your<00:03:25.970> stovetop<00:03:26.239> once

were to do this on your stovetop once
you<00:03:27.350> achieve<00:03:27.440> that<00:03:27.709> full<00:03:27.950> rolling<00:03:28.190> boil<00:03:28.430> is

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:28.610 
you achieve that full rolling boil is

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:29.860 
you achieve that full rolling boil is
when<00:03:28.790> you<00:03:28.910> would<00:03:29.000> start<00:03:29.239> your<00:03:29.299> processing

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:29.870 
when you would start your processing

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:32.890 
when you would start your processing
time<00:03:30.519> you<00:03:31.519> know<00:03:31.610> what<00:03:31.820> I<00:03:31.850> just<00:03:31.940> said<00:03:32.269> stovetop

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:32.900 
time you know what I just said stovetop

time you know what I just said stovetop
you<00:03:33.200> don't<00:03:33.380> need<00:03:33.500> a<00:03:33.530> stovetop<00:03:34.070> to<00:03:34.430> use<00:03:34.610> the

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:34.820 
you don't need a stovetop to use the

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:36.819 
you don't need a stovetop to use the
electric<00:03:35.150> water<00:03:35.329> bath<00:03:35.600> canner<00:03:35.870> you<00:03:36.530> can<00:03:36.680> use

electric water bath canner you can use

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:38.710 
electric water bath canner you can use
this<00:03:36.980> over<00:03:37.400> by<00:03:37.519> your<00:03:37.640> sink<00:03:37.970> wherever<00:03:38.329> you<00:03:38.510> want

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760 
to use it it's going to be 20% more

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.580 
to use it it's going to be 20% more
efficient<00:03:41.209> than<00:03:41.329> using<00:03:41.360> your<00:03:41.630> stove<00:03:41.959> top<00:03:42.170> but

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:42.590 
efficient than using your stove top but

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:44.140 
efficient than using your stove top but
don't<00:03:42.650> worry<00:03:42.890> because<00:03:43.040> it<00:03:43.430> also<00:03:43.610> allows<00:03:44.000> you

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:03.530 
and does it get any better than being

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:05.289 
and does it get any better than being
