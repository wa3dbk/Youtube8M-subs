00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:12.410
 for all the member of the 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:14.809
 second template of tron ingeteam and today 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:17.240
 we teach you a new series of the channel 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:19.580
 kind of spots and places to do the 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.530
 signs on the maps we start with the 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:24.410
 more after map making the statue 

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:27.199
 through the wall on the sofa and 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:29.449
 good for this we will have to use the 

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:31.009
 tomahawk and lift it up and 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:33.329
 nothing go through the wall just like 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:37.109
 in this box 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:38.670
 quite useful although I think that by the 

00:00:37.109 --> 00:00:42.090
 knee gives you enough if you do not have 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.650
 a chair or something in front that covers 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.450
 now we go here to the corner we 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:47.880
 we knocked down ayala shadows is pretty 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.280
 well the site 

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:51.930
 there's not much light in this pump so 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.250
 all the sites that are almost good 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:57.790
 except those little tables 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:00.490
 again in the same place to his 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:01.930
 from that zeta we do it through the 

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:04.120
 statue if we look up back 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:08.350
 we passed all the pointer is very good 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:11.370
 site for the trash can this 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:11.370
 trash can is quite 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.650
 multipurpose because if we put ourselves very 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:18.570
 right we will go through the wall and we will 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.000
 you will see the body to a chair in the 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.100
 elevator inside but if we put more 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.850
 on the left something centered will not happen 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.340
 nothing 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:29.080
 and now I'm going to show you that if you put on 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:31.070
 very right , you can see it 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:33.140
 perfectly 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:36.740
 there you see him go through the door of the 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:39.320
 lift and I do magic 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:44.950
 nothing we're going to teach the last 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:44.950
 sites that are in this bomb from to 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:49.610
 one is away from the bomb how are you going to 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:53.420
 see here is on the other side of the room 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:54.980
 it's quite easy to do since only 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.680
 you have to stand up and through is 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:02:01.130
 no wall or anything but it's pretty good 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:04.010
 since although you have a good angle 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:05.390
 of vision even if they pass through the door 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:07.280
 side of you I think they will go from 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:08.720
 long to bashir well from the pump then 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:12.260
 They can confuse you with the pot 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:13.940
 there with the plant one there we were 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:17.960
 proving that if you could lie down to go in 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:20.920
 to do the same thing but you can not 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:23.440
 that nothing last spot on the bomb 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:26.770
 and let's see is below the column 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:28.000
 and it's pretty good since normally 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:29.500
 when it's good for me in this area 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.849
 usually happen with the part of the 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.489
 left to go directly to place 

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:36.000
 although the problem is that if you go by 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:38.130
 the other side by the side of your response 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.260
 I think you're always going to be spent 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:42.690
 to the pump this pump should be 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.440
 much more difficult there are no shadows no 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:47.640
 there are you degrees 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:49.530
 there are almost no corners so nothing is going 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.630
 to look for places let's get inside 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:54.300
 of this wheel and we hold the hat 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:57.880
 black people about whatever and 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:03:00.010
 we have a good view of the pump 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:01.450
 I tell you there are very few corners and the 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:04.500
 that you have to take full advantage of them 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:06.510
 let's go to this corner first 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:08.660
 and the same thing is pretty shameless in 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:10.670
 actually in this bomb all 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:12.740
 but good is what there is no other 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:15.380
 thing here as I tell you the other corner 

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:19.690
 harder still as there are many 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:19.690
 less shadow that looks pretty good 

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:24.490
 now we are going to teach a site that is 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.980
 very good 

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:27.490
 makes the best if it is not the best 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:29.470
 this bomb 

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:31.450
 the only one thing is that there is something left 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:34.000
 remote is looking through these 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:36.000
 crystals the pump looks perfectly 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.490
 although it does not look like it and I do not think that the 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:42.840
 rival is going to look around if you're like 

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:42.840
 you see it and in the background the bomb 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:49.230
 It's very good, I'm telling you and from here 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:51.569
 Well you can create a very nice weather 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:53.400
 now let's teach the site more more 

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:56.099
 most brazen of the whole bomb and of 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:04:00.510
 all the games that have been in call 

00:03:56.099 --> 00:04:02.780
 of duty that is on top of the truck if using 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:05.959
 a clip from here 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:09.280
 you are gods I assure you it is very 

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:09.280
 shameless but good 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:14.230
 last spot will be in the other in another 

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:16.380
 corner with and I always tell you in 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:19.260
 corners in this pump 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:21.510
 there is not there is very downloaded we were 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:24.060
 doing tests but in being here in 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:26.430
 the one that I was now in a series that 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:28.890
 let's do then we will try all 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:30.480
 the weeks we will take it both me and 

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:32.910
 toti which is also of the second 

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:35.490
 template and nothing I hope you have 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:36.000
 liked like favorites and even the 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:38.960
 next 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.960
 goodbye
