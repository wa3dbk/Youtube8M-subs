00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
10 so you can see I got a hit from the

10 so you can see I got a hit from the
Play<00:00:07.680> Store<00:00:07.740> quite<00:00:08.580> expensive<00:00:08.880> game<00:00:09.179> it's<00:00:09.389> 499

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
Play Store quite expensive game it's 499

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.770

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.770 
now i'm running a custom kernel a custom
rom<00:00:12.990> so<00:00:13.410> the<00:00:14.280> performance<00:00:15.240> might<00:00:15.420> slightly

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
rom so the performance might slightly

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.230 
rom so the performance might slightly
differ<00:00:16.109> from<00:00:16.320> the<00:00:16.710> from<00:00:17.670> the<00:00:17.699> normal<00:00:18.029> but<00:00:18.150> i'm

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
not overclocked to anything like that

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.950 
not overclocked to anything like that
now<00:00:20.130> i<00:00:20.160> am<00:00:20.430> going<00:00:20.460> to<00:00:20.640> run<00:00:20.789> FPS<00:00:21.300> media<00:00:21.600> like<00:00:21.810> i

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
now i am going to run FPS media like i

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.560 
now i am going to run FPS media like i
normally<00:00:22.020> do<00:00:22.519> you<00:00:23.519> see<00:00:23.699> the<00:00:23.850> FPS<00:00:24.180> at<00:00:24.300> the<00:00:24.359> top

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
normally do you see the FPS at the top

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.689 
normally do you see the FPS at the top
there<00:00:24.810> and<00:00:24.990> to<00:00:25.619> make<00:00:25.800> this<00:00:25.920> work<00:00:25.980> in<00:00:26.400> games

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
there and to make this work in games

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:32.420 
there and to make this work in games
actually<00:00:26.970> you<00:00:27.300> have<00:00:27.539> to<00:00:28.160> turn<00:00:29.160> on<00:00:31.279> where<00:00:32.279> are

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
actually you have to turn on where are

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.690 
actually you have to turn on where are
you<00:00:32.579> disable<00:00:33.030> hard<00:00:33.210> overlays<00:00:33.630> okay<00:00:34.399> and<00:00:35.399> let's

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
you disable hard overlays okay and let's

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.270 
you disable hard overlays okay and let's
do<00:00:35.820> this<00:00:36.380> so<00:00:37.380> we'll<00:00:37.559> make<00:00:37.649> this<00:00:37.800> full<00:00:38.010> screen

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
do this so we'll make this full screen

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:44.380 
do this so we'll make this full screen
because<00:00:39.059> you<00:00:39.210> know<00:00:39.360> full<00:00:39.989> screens<00:00:40.260> the<00:00:40.440> bomb

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:44.390 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:47.479 

and<00:00:45.410> here<00:00:46.410> we<00:00:46.500> go<00:00:46.710> the<00:00:46.890> dark<00:00:47.100> knight<00:00:47.280> rises

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
and here we go the dark knight rises

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:56.930 
and here we go the dark knight rises
game<00:00:47.969> on<00:00:48.270> the<00:00:48.390> nexus<00:00:48.750> 10<00:00:52.010> come<00:00:53.010> on<00:00:53.160> loading<00:00:55.940> the

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
game on the nexus 10 come on loading the

dark knight rises touch the screen okay

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.319 
dark knight rises touch the screen okay
so<00:01:01.590> in<00:01:02.039> the<00:01:02.190> menu<00:01:02.609> at<00:01:02.730> the<00:01:02.760> moment<00:01:03.180> we're

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
so in the menu at the moment we're

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.690 
so in the menu at the moment we're
sitting<00:01:03.750> around<00:01:04.019> well<00:01:04.830> we're<00:01:05.070> dropping<00:01:05.489> to<00:01:05.670> a

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
sitting around well we're dropping to a

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.109 
sitting around well we're dropping to a
low<00:01:06.000> 10<00:01:06.360> sitting<00:01:06.840> around<00:01:06.990> 11<00:01:07.530> which<00:01:08.310> sucks<00:01:08.790> so

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
low 10 sitting around 11 which sucks so

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.420 
low 10 sitting around 11 which sucks so
badly<00:01:09.450> already<00:01:09.960> we're<00:01:10.830> going<00:01:10.950> to<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.130> options

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
badly already we're going to the options

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:12.830 
badly already we're going to the options
to<00:01:11.520> see<00:01:11.640> there's<00:01:11.820> any<00:01:11.909> graphical<00:01:12.600> settings

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
to see there's any graphical settings

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.070 
to see there's any graphical settings
there<00:01:13.170> isn't<00:01:13.939> so<00:01:14.939> this<00:01:15.330> looks<00:01:15.659> like<00:01:15.900> it's

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
there isn't so this looks like it's

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.780 
there isn't so this looks like it's
going<00:01:16.200> to<00:01:16.259> be<00:01:16.350> another<00:01:16.500> case<00:01:16.799> of<00:01:16.830> really

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
going to be another case of really

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.539 
going to be another case of really
really<00:01:18.420> poor<00:01:18.659> optimization<00:01:19.619> from<00:01:19.890> Gameloft

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
really poor optimization from Gameloft

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.050 
really poor optimization from Gameloft
for<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:20.939> nexus<00:01:21.270> 10<00:01:21.710> we'll<00:01:22.710> just<00:01:23.130> continue<00:01:23.549> and

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
for the nexus 10 we'll just continue and

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.899 
for the nexus 10 we'll just continue and
see<00:01:24.210> what<00:01:24.360> it's<00:01:24.450> like<00:01:24.570> in<00:01:24.840> the<00:01:25.080> game<00:01:25.490> so<00:01:26.490> let<00:01:26.880> me

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
see what it's like in the game so let me

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.190 
see what it's like in the game so let me
just<00:01:27.060> talk<00:01:27.180> about<00:01:27.330> that<00:01:27.509> game<00:01:27.720> off<00:01:27.960> they've

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
just talk about that game off they've

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.260 
just talk about that game off they've
been<00:01:28.409> notoriously<00:01:28.979> bad<00:01:29.520> in<00:01:29.820> actually

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
been notoriously bad in actually

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.030 
been notoriously bad in actually
optimizing<00:01:31.049> games<00:01:31.290> for<00:01:31.619> the<00:01:31.680> new<00:01:31.829> Nexus

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
optimizing games for the new Nexus

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.700 
optimizing games for the new Nexus
devices<00:01:32.579> in<00:01:32.970> fact<00:01:33.659> I<00:01:33.780> haven't<00:01:33.960> seen<00:01:34.200> one<00:01:34.470> game

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
devices in fact I haven't seen one game

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.289 
devices in fact I haven't seen one game
where<00:01:34.829> they<00:01:34.950> actually<00:01:35.070> have<00:01:35.520> optimized<00:01:36.030> it

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
where they actually have optimized it

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.080 
where they actually have optimized it
and<00:01:37.009> this<00:01:38.009> one<00:01:38.220> looks<00:01:38.400> like<00:01:38.610> it's<00:01:38.790> going<00:01:38.909> to<00:01:38.970> be

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
and this one looks like it's going to be

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.789 
and this one looks like it's going to be
the<00:01:39.210> worst<00:01:39.479> like<00:01:40.020> all<00:01:40.290> there<00:01:40.439> are<00:01:40.500> other<00:01:40.590> games

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
the worst like all there are other games

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.190 
the worst like all there are other games
they<00:01:41.340> work<00:01:41.640> pretty<00:01:42.000> well<00:01:42.270> there's<00:01:42.750> still<00:01:43.049> like

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
they work pretty well there's still like

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.020 
they work pretty well there's still like
20<00:01:43.590> 30<00:01:43.860> frames<00:01:44.159> per<00:01:44.250> second<00:01:44.700> so<00:01:44.790> it's<00:01:44.909> not

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
20 30 frames per second so it's not

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.520 
20 30 frames per second so it's not
really<00:01:45.090> big<00:01:45.450> deal<00:01:45.630> it's<00:01:45.810> still<00:01:45.960> pretty<00:01:46.140> smooth

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
really big deal it's still pretty smooth

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.190 
really big deal it's still pretty smooth
this<00:01:47.310> one<00:01:47.549> so<00:01:47.729> far<00:01:48.000> looks<00:01:48.329> terrible<00:01:48.990> it<00:01:49.049> looks

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
this one so far looks terrible it looks

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.780 
this one so far looks terrible it looks
like<00:01:49.350> it's<00:01:49.500> going<00:01:49.619> to<00:01:49.680> run<00:01:49.860> it<00:01:49.950> like<00:01:50.070> 10<00:01:50.460> frames

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
like it's going to run it like 10 frames

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.550 
like it's going to run it like 10 frames
per<00:01:51.000> second<00:01:51.360> which<00:01:51.479> is<00:01:51.509> unplayable<00:01:52.049> and

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
per second which is unplayable and

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.130 
per second which is unplayable and
there's<00:01:53.399> no<00:01:53.579> way<00:01:53.850> that<00:01:54.030> this<00:01:54.180> tablet<00:01:54.659> is<00:01:54.780> just

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
there's no way that this tablet is just

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.630 
there's no way that this tablet is just
struggling<00:01:55.560> with<00:01:55.710> the<00:01:55.829> game<00:01:56.009> completely<00:01:56.250> it

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
struggling with the game completely it

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:57.980 
struggling with the game completely it
should<00:01:56.909> be<00:01:57.060> able<00:01:57.149> to<00:01:57.299> handle<00:01:57.450> a<00:01:57.630> lot<00:01:57.810> higher

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
should be able to handle a lot higher

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.080 
should be able to handle a lot higher
than<00:01:58.049> that<00:01:58.350> so<00:01:59.040> anyway<00:01:59.340> here<00:01:59.549> it<00:01:59.640> is<00:01:59.759> here's

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
than that so anyway here it is here's

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.510 
than that so anyway here it is here's
the<00:02:00.180> game<00:02:00.560> you<00:02:01.560> can<00:02:01.740> see<00:02:01.890> here<00:02:02.100> as<00:02:02.159> a<00:02:02.280> pan

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
the game you can see here as a pan

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.319 
the game you can see here as a pan
around<00:02:02.820> it<00:02:03.060> is<00:02:03.320> like<00:02:04.320> a<00:02:04.619> slide<00:02:05.310> shows<00:02:05.700> awful

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
around it is like a slide shows awful

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.719 
around it is like a slide shows awful
basically<00:02:06.780> at<00:02:07.290> the<00:02:07.409> top<00:02:07.619> here<00:02:07.860> with<00:02:08.160> maxing

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
basically at the top here with maxing

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.510 
basically at the top here with maxing
out<00:02:08.849> 14<00:02:09.660> 14<00:02:10.619> frames<00:02:10.830> per<00:02:11.069> second<00:02:11.400> which<00:02:11.489> is

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
out 14 14 frames per second which is

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.700 
out 14 14 frames per second which is
just<00:02:11.940> terrible

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:12.710 
just terrible

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:15.170 
just terrible
this<00:02:13.710> is<00:02:13.860> basically<00:02:14.250> unplayable<00:02:14.700> on<00:02:15.030> this

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
this is basically unplayable on this

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.740 
this is basically unplayable on this
tablet<00:02:16.310> like<00:02:17.310> I<00:02:17.490> said<00:02:17.670> I<00:02:17.850> think<00:02:18.150> it's<00:02:18.300> all<00:02:18.510> down

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
tablet like I said I think it's all down

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.450 
tablet like I said I think it's all down
to<00:02:18.780> optimization<00:02:19.470> I<00:02:19.770> mean<00:02:19.920> it<00:02:20.010> looks<00:02:20.190> great

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:20.460 
to optimization I mean it looks great

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:23.300 
to optimization I mean it looks great
very<00:02:20.790> sharp<00:02:21.410> but<00:02:22.410> it's<00:02:22.560> unplayable<00:02:22.890> that's

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
very sharp but it's unplayable that's

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.310 
very sharp but it's unplayable that's
stupid<00:02:23.820> there's<00:02:24.240> no<00:02:24.420> way<00:02:24.630> this<00:02:24.810> tablet<00:02:25.200> can

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 
stupid there's no way this tablet can

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.110 
stupid there's no way this tablet can
perform<00:02:25.620> this<00:02:25.830> badly<00:02:26.190> on<00:02:26.490> this<00:02:26.670> one<00:02:26.880> game

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
perform this badly on this one game

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.880 
perform this badly on this one game
whereas<00:02:27.660> on<00:02:27.810> the<00:02:27.840> other<00:02:27.960> game<00:02:28.320> of<00:02:28.500> games<00:02:28.740> it

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
whereas on the other game of games it

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.600 
whereas on the other game of games it
performs<00:02:29.600> pretty<00:02:30.600> well<00:02:30.930> if<00:02:31.230> not<00:02:31.710> a<00:02:31.980> little<00:02:32.490> bit

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
performs pretty well if not a little bit

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.430 
performs pretty well if not a little bit
worse<00:02:32.880> than<00:02:33.120> normal<00:02:33.270> but<00:02:33.570> still<00:02:33.960> this<00:02:34.200> is<00:02:34.260> a

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
worse than normal but still this is a

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.590 
worse than normal but still this is a
look<00:02:35.340> at<00:02:35.460> that<00:02:35.610> this<00:02:35.850> is<00:02:36.030> basically

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
look at that this is basically

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.740 
look at that this is basically
unplayable<00:02:37.110> 10<00:02:37.740> frames<00:02:38.190> per<00:02:38.430> second<00:02:38.820> man<00:02:38.970> 10

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
unplayable 10 frames per second man 10

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
just going to quickly check something

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:50.180 
just going to quickly check something
here<00:02:46.470> I<00:02:47.480> am<00:02:48.480> running<00:02:48.690> at<00:02:49.020> the<00:02:49.140> normal<00:02:49.560> governor

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
here I am running at the normal governor

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.040 
here I am running at the normal governor
and<00:02:50.370> stuff<00:02:50.550> like<00:02:50.670> that<00:02:50.730> I<00:02:51.090> am<00:02:51.840> actually

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050 
and stuff like that I am actually

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:54.050 
and stuff like that I am actually
running<00:02:52.350> a<00:02:52.470> different<00:02:52.620> io<00:02:52.890> scheduler<00:02:53.160> but<00:02:53.730> it

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
running a different io scheduler but it

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:55.310 
running a different io scheduler but it
shouldn't<00:02:54.450> make<00:02:54.510> much<00:02:54.720> difference<00:02:54.990> we<00:02:55.290> can

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:55.320 
shouldn't make much difference we can

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.230 
shouldn't make much difference we can
put<00:02:55.560> it<00:02:55.650> back<00:02:55.740> on<00:02:55.800> stock<00:02:56.250> here<00:02:56.490> i'm<00:02:56.970> going<00:02:57.150> to

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:57.240 
put it back on stock here i'm going to

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:59.360 
put it back on stock here i'm going to
overclock<00:02:57.660> it<00:02:57.690> to<00:02:57.960> a<00:02:57.990> 2<00:02:58.320> gigahertz<00:02:58.860> oh<00:02:59.220> this

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
overclock it to a 2 gigahertz oh this

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.100 
overclock it to a 2 gigahertz oh this
tablet<00:02:59.670> is<00:02:59.700> no<00:02:59.850> running<00:03:00.150> at<00:03:00.240> two<00:03:00.450> gig<00:03:00.660> us<00:03:00.810> and

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
tablet is no running at two gig us and

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:03.140 
tablet is no running at two gig us and
we'll<00:03:01.230> see<00:03:01.410> if<00:03:01.620> it<00:03:01.770> helps<00:03:01.980> that<00:03:02.280> game<00:03:02.550> at<00:03:02.760> all<00:03:02.940> I

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
we'll see if it helps that game at all I

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.450 
we'll see if it helps that game at all I
know<00:03:03.210> the<00:03:03.450> games<00:03:03.660> run<00:03:03.870> on<00:03:03.990> the<00:03:04.050> GPU<00:03:04.440> but<00:03:05.400> I

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:05.460 
know the games run on the GPU but I

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:07.160 
know the games run on the GPU but I
can't<00:03:05.640> overclock<00:03:06.000> the<00:03:06.090> CPU<00:03:06.540> at<00:03:06.630> the<00:03:06.720> moment<00:03:07.050> so

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
can't overclock the CPU at the moment so

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:08.780 
can't overclock the CPU at the moment so
I'm<00:03:07.560> going<00:03:07.710> to<00:03:07.770> run<00:03:07.860> at<00:03:08.070> two<00:03:08.220> gigahertz<00:03:08.490> and

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
I'm going to run at two gigahertz and

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:14.450 
I'm going to run at two gigahertz and
see<00:03:08.880> if<00:03:08.970> it<00:03:09.060> helps<00:03:09.860> so<00:03:11.840> let's<00:03:12.950> get<00:03:13.950> back<00:03:14.190> to<00:03:14.370> the

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:14.460 
see if it helps so let's get back to the

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:19.940 
see if it helps so let's get back to the
game<00:03:14.490> who<00:03:14.790> go<00:03:16.580> hit<00:03:17.580> continue<00:03:18.770> has<00:03:19.770> it<00:03:19.890> really

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
game who go hit continue has it really

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:21.800 
game who go hit continue has it really
helps<00:03:20.340> is<00:03:20.430> it<00:03:20.580> we've<00:03:21.000> probably<00:03:21.030> got<00:03:21.390> a<00:03:21.510> few

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
helps is it we've probably got a few

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:23.960 
helps is it we've probably got a few
more<00:03:21.990> frames<00:03:22.290> maybe<00:03:22.710> two<00:03:23.100> more<00:03:23.370> frames<00:03:23.640> but

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
more frames maybe two more frames but

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.960 
more frames maybe two more frames but
otherwise<00:03:24.240> it's<00:03:25.070> it's<00:03:26.070> still<00:03:26.370> unplayable<00:03:26.700> one

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
otherwise it's it's still unplayable one

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:28.400 
otherwise it's it's still unplayable one
it's<00:03:27.090> pretty<00:03:27.360> damn<00:03:27.540> terrible<00:03:27.990> i<00:03:28.050> want<00:03:28.230> to<00:03:28.290> lie

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
it's pretty damn terrible i want to lie

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:31.820 
it's pretty damn terrible i want to lie
i<00:03:28.680> mean<00:03:29.220> look<00:03:29.370> at<00:03:29.520> this<00:03:30.410> i'm<00:03:31.410> going<00:03:31.590> to<00:03:31.680> do<00:03:31.800> a

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:31.830 
i mean look at this i'm going to do a

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:34.010 
i mean look at this i'm going to do a
test<00:03:32.040> on<00:03:32.370> my<00:03:32.460> nexus<00:03:32.820> 4<00:03:33.090> shortly<00:03:33.690> after<00:03:33.930> this

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:34.020 
test on my nexus 4 shortly after this

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:36.200 
test on my nexus 4 shortly after this
video<00:03:34.320> so<00:03:34.500> stay<00:03:34.560> tuned<00:03:34.980> and<00:03:35.130> we'll<00:03:35.220> see<00:03:35.460> how

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:36.210 
video so stay tuned and we'll see how

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:38.000 
video so stay tuned and we'll see how
bad<00:03:36.420> it<00:03:36.450> is<00:03:36.600> on<00:03:36.780> there<00:03:36.990> if<00:03:37.200> it's<00:03:37.350> okay<00:03:37.680> on<00:03:37.830> there

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 
bad it is on there if it's okay on there

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:39.920 
bad it is on there if it's okay on there
but<00:03:38.490> this<00:03:38.760> is<00:03:38.940> unplayable<00:03:39.300> and<00:03:39.690> this<00:03:39.780> is
