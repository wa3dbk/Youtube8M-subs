00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:57.790
 with an apple started training 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:57.790

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:28.280
 shows that I have there I am not 

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:30.320
 exactly what it is rather boring it 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:33.009
 I'm pissed off myself that I had 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.009
 paid just now 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:44.450

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:47.930

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:55.700
 boulay that the earth has never known 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:02:00.170
 but what am I nil this 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:05.200
 level there basically I'm ashamed of myself and 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:07.490
 yet I did not even care what 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:12.440
 it's not good it was just for the 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:15.140
 sound of a book I saw a lot 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.640
 many many of you me the 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.890
 world a tutorial how did you do to 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:23.440
 join the waiter blah blah blah then 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:26.540
 friends when you buy a thing 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:27.890
 if I show you how to do it 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:30.260
 as if I will show you how to be 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:33.860
 illegal since you will be using a 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:36.590
 vpn if you want to join and miss it 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:37.640
 there are many studios already but if that 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:39.410
 you really want to heart 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.880
 put me in the comments and this 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:42.860
 by al would be risks for you and 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:44.840
 I will show you how to deal with 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:46.100
 two different ways and who 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.959
 could also arranged a lot of 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:49.160
 people and who has gone shown as 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:51.370
 way because it's a way that 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:55.280
 allows access by allopass 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:57.620
 finally short so if you really want 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:03.709
 really and that's really expected 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:04.730
 bit the month but that's it really 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:06.769
 not something that is important to me 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:09.440
 for now but if you want the 

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:10.880
 Meme it game should be here is doping the fire that is 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.870
 death we always lead euros said by 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:13.160
 year because every time in 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:16.400
 confuses 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:17.510

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:32.770

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:36.950

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:59.480

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:05.660
