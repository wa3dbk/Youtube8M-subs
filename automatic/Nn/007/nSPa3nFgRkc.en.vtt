I<00:05:46.260> know<00:05:46.410> I<00:05:46.440> have<00:05:46.650> said<00:05:46.830> this<00:05:46.860> before<00:05:46.980> but

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:47.610 
I know I have said this before but

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:49.880 
I know I have said this before but
honestly<00:05:48.090> this<00:05:48.690> really<00:05:49.080> is<00:05:49.230> the<00:05:49.260> exact<00:05:49.710> same

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:49.890 
honestly this really is the exact same

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:52.070 
honestly this really is the exact same
color<00:05:50.070> of<00:05:50.310> my<00:05:50.430> lips<00:05:50.460> so<00:05:51.090> I<00:05:51.150> would<00:05:51.330> put<00:05:51.540> it<00:05:51.630> on<00:05:51.750> it

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:52.080 
color of my lips so I would put it on it

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:56.750 
color of my lips so I would put it on it
would<00:05:52.200> give<00:05:52.230> kind<00:05:53.190> of<00:05:53.340> a<00:05:54.380> soft<00:05:55.380> like<00:05:55.800> Sheen<00:05:56.190> to

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:56.760 
would give kind of a soft like Sheen to

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:58.670 
would give kind of a soft like Sheen to
it<00:05:56.790> but<00:05:57.510> you<00:05:57.630> couldn't<00:05:57.870> really<00:05:57.990> see<00:05:58.260> any<00:05:58.380> color

00:05:58.670 --> 00:05:58.680 
it but you couldn't really see any color

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:02.090 
it but you couldn't really see any color
so<00:05:59.640> I<00:06:00.120> then<00:06:00.990> would<00:06:01.200> put<00:06:01.380> like<00:06:01.470> a<00:06:01.590> nude<00:06:01.890> lip

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:02.100 
so I then would put like a nude lip

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:04.640 
so I then would put like a nude lip
gloss<00:06:02.430> on<00:06:02.670> it<00:06:02.880> and<00:06:03.090> it<00:06:03.390> was<00:06:03.630> gorgeous<00:06:03.990> not<00:06:04.350> nude

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:04.650 
gloss on it and it was gorgeous not nude

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:06.860 
gloss on it and it was gorgeous not nude
I<00:06:04.800> guess<00:06:04.980> but<00:06:05.130> a<00:06:05.190> neutral<00:06:05.610> lip<00:06:05.760> gloss<00:06:05.970> so

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:06.870 
I guess but a neutral lip gloss so

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:08.630 
I guess but a neutral lip gloss so
