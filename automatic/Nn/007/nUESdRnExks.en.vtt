00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:24.179 

one<00:00:22.930> of<00:00:23.050> the<00:00:23.109> reasons<00:00:23.439> brenell<00:00:23.710> is<00:00:23.800> so<00:00:23.949> great

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:24.189 
one of the reasons brenell is so great

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:25.290 
one of the reasons brenell is so great
is<00:00:24.340> that<00:00:24.369> it<00:00:24.550> only<00:00:24.670> takes<00:00:24.939> seven<00:00:25.180> ingredients

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:25.300 
is that it only takes seven ingredients

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.240 
is that it only takes seven ingredients
most<00:00:26.020> of<00:00:26.230> which<00:00:26.320> you<00:00:26.439> probably<00:00:26.470> already<00:00:26.980> have

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:27.250 
most of which you probably already have

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:28.589 
most of which you probably already have
in<00:00:27.279> your<00:00:27.400> pantry<00:00:27.759> so<00:00:28.090> the<00:00:28.210> first<00:00:28.390> thing<00:00:28.539> I'm

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:28.599 
in your pantry so the first thing I'm

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:29.999 
in your pantry so the first thing I'm
going<00:00:28.630> to<00:00:28.750> add<00:00:28.840> is<00:00:28.990> water<00:00:29.259> and<00:00:29.590> that<00:00:29.860> is

00:00:29.999 --> 00:00:30.009 
going to add is water and that is

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:32.249 
going to add is water and that is
because<00:00:30.369> if<00:00:30.700> you<00:00:30.820> add<00:00:30.970> sugar<00:00:31.000> first<00:00:31.630> you<00:00:31.990> run

00:00:32.249 --> 00:00:32.259 
because if you add sugar first you run

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:33.750 
because if you add sugar first you run
the<00:00:32.410> risk<00:00:32.590> of<00:00:32.739> it<00:00:32.860> burning<00:00:33.100> on<00:00:33.309> the<00:00:33.340> bottom<00:00:33.670> of

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:33.760 
the risk of it burning on the bottom of

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:35.310 
the risk of it burning on the bottom of
the<00:00:33.820> pan<00:00:34.120> and<00:00:34.480> then<00:00:34.870> I'm<00:00:34.930> going<00:00:35.050> to<00:00:35.079> add<00:00:35.199> my

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:35.320 
the pan and then I'm going to add my

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.220 
the pan and then I'm going to add my
sugar<00:00:35.379> and<00:00:35.949> then<00:00:36.910> I'm<00:00:37.059> going<00:00:37.239> to<00:00:37.360> add<00:00:37.540> the<00:00:37.900> corn

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:38.230 
sugar and then I'm going to add the corn

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:40.320 
sugar and then I'm going to add the corn
syrup<00:00:38.500> and<00:00:38.680> just<00:00:39.190> to<00:00:39.340> clarify<00:00:39.489> the<00:00:39.790> corn<00:00:40.180> syrup

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:40.330 
syrup and just to clarify the corn syrup

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:42.329
