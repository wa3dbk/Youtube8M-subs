00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.779
 Hi everyone, I am very glad to see 

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:17.560
 you on your channel today we are with you 

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:19.560
 will create 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:22.660
 Another masterpiece will do makeup 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.430
 quite interesting and unusual and 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:26.169
 heroes of the day will be today 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:28.060
 perform here so divided 

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:30.040
 purple mascara from essence 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:31.930
 if you have been watching my channel for a long time then you 

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:33.970
 You probably know that I am a huge fan 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:35.920
 colored carcasses especially in summer 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:38.620
 time I often use color 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:40.450
 mascara in their makeup seems to me colored 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:42.970
 mascara can dilute absolutely any 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:45.760
 boring makeup highlight eye color 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:48.790
 add some zest to the image in general 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:50.590
 Yes, I love colored mascaras when I saw 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:52.600
 that essence has a whole line 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:54.340
 color mascara I certainly could not 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.560
 pass by I bought almost everything 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:58.780
 shades perhaps with the exception of burgundy 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:00.940
 now actually regret a little 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:03.520
 that I did not grab her but it does not matter I 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:06.100
 I will go for it a little bit later in this 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:08.259
 carcass shade almost coincides with 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:10.990
 the tint of the package itself, that is, it is not 

00:01:08.259 --> 00:01:13.000
 pure purple dark mascara is very 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:15.130
 strongly divided violet eyelashes 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.840
 this shade looks very unusual 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:19.539
 but generally let's do it now 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:21.460
 makeup and you see everything and so before 

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:23.609
 to start my eyes I need to prepare 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:26.560
 I only have my face on my face 

00:01:23.609 --> 00:01:28.030
 moisturizer on lips balm and without 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:31.060
 I will use any base today 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:33.280
 your favorite bibi cream from your wife could 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:35.619
 this baby cream is pretty lumpy and 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.630
 elastic consistency and honestly 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:39.509
 it is most convenient for me to apply it not beauty 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:42.159
 a blender using a conventional 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:44.229
 synthetic flat tassels by the way 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:46.659
 This is my new brush from mark ruble 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:49.380
 if interested I will review later on 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:49.380
 this brand 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:06.470
 then I need to use 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:10.750
 concealer my case it will be easy 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:10.750
 fluid from t-shirt potter and in shade a2 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:43.560
 now I'll fix it all crumbly 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:45.450
 rice powder from by iso to impart 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.820
 small face sculpture i will 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.470
 use this dark powder from 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:52.100
 Criolane in shade which is called 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:52.100
 Sahara 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:07.850
 I will put a ruddy highlighter practically in 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:10.130
 the end of doing your makeup therefore 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:12.080
 let's turn our eyes now so I 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:15.400
 I'll start with the base under the shadow in my case it 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:15.400
 there will be a press base 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:25.880
 I will begin my makeup as usual with 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:28.340
 inner corner of the eye and put there 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:32.140
 white matte shadow of the belt from the series 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:32.140
 cashmere number 601 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:47.420
 for all the remaining moving eyelids I 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:52.310
