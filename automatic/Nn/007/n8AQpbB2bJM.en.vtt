00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:43.729 
wow here we go this is not gonna be very
practical<00:02:42.389> though<00:02:42.780> because<00:02:42.989> yeah<00:02:43.349> it<00:02:43.500> was<00:02:43.590> it

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:43.739

and<00:02:46.169> eventually<00:02:46.950> we<00:02:46.980> just<00:02:47.220> kill<00:02:47.370> each<00:02:47.459> other

00:02:47.589 --> 00:02:47.599 
and eventually we just kill each other

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:50.539 
and eventually we just kill each other
at<00:02:48.599> this<00:02:48.989> point<00:02:49.440> i<00:02:49.739> pretty<00:02:49.950> much<00:02:49.980> one<00:02:50.280> shot

00:02:50.539 --> 00:02:50.549 
at this point i pretty much one shot

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:54.039 
at this point i pretty much one shot
everything<00:02:50.880> so<00:02:51.419> that's<00:02:52.319> pretty<00:02:53.220> easy<00:02:53.400> i

00:02:54.039 --> 00:02:54.049 
everything so that's pretty easy i

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:56.539 
everything so that's pretty easy i
noticed<00:02:55.049> towards<00:02:55.349> the<00:02:55.440> end<00:02:55.620> of<00:02:55.799> this<00:02:55.950> little

00:02:56.539 --> 00:02:56.549

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989 
some monsters but it seems like it's

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:05.360 
some monsters but it seems like it's
going<00:03:04.230> to<00:03:04.260> get<00:03:04.410> a<00:03:04.470> little<00:03:04.620> harder<00:03:04.980> but<00:03:05.160> at

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
going to get a little harder but at

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.670 
going to get a little harder but at

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:16.700 
you get like a series of events to deal

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:21.790 
you get like a series of events to deal
with<00:03:18.430> so<00:03:19.430> well<00:03:20.330> that<00:03:20.720> was<00:03:20.959> easy<00:03:21.350> enough<00:03:21.500> at

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:21.800 
with so well that was easy enough at

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:24.490 
with so well that was easy enough at
first<00:03:22.270> again<00:03:23.270> all<00:03:23.780> these<00:03:24.170> are<00:03:24.290> going<00:03:24.380> to<00:03:24.440> be

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:24.500 
first again all these are going to be

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.949 
first again all these are going to be
one<00:03:24.680> shots<00:03:24.950> and<00:03:25.220> all<00:03:25.580> of<00:03:25.730> these<00:03:25.880> as<00:03:26.120> the<00:03:26.720> quest
