00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
them up hold this piece back because it

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.210 
them up hold this piece back because it
will<00:01:35.490> spring<00:01:35.759> back<00:01:35.790> into<00:01:36.180> place<00:01:36.420> just<00:01:37.220> push

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
will spring back into place just push

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.560 
will spring back into place just push
this<00:01:38.430> piece<00:01:38.700> up<00:01:38.970> and<00:01:39.600> make<00:01:39.780> sure<00:01:39.950> this<00:01:40.950> peg

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:41.570 
this piece up and make sure this peg

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:48.560 
this piece up and make sure this peg
goes<00:01:42.570> into<00:01:42.899> this<00:01:43.020> peg<00:01:43.320> here<00:01:45.140> and<00:01:47.240> when<00:01:48.240> you<00:01:48.390> do

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
goes into this peg here and when you do

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.639 
goes into this peg here and when you do
that<00:01:48.930> the<00:01:49.430> autumn<00:01:50.430> or<00:01:50.640> occurs<00:01:51.479> where<00:01:52.020> the<00:01:52.320> arms

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
that the autumn or occurs where the arms

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.969 
that the autumn or occurs where the arms
flip<00:01:52.920> down<00:01:53.659> it's<00:01:54.659> a<00:01:54.930> little<00:01:55.170> tricky<00:01:55.590> to<00:01:55.710> get

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
flip down it's a little tricky to get

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:06.000 
flip down it's a little tricky to get
pegged<00:01:56.430> in

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:06.010 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:11.950 

and<00:02:07.010> the<00:02:07.670> arms<00:02:07.940> fall<00:02:08.210> down<00:02:08.479> and<00:02:09.050> there<00:02:09.619> is<00:02:10.960> that

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:11.960 
and the arms fall down and there is that

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:17.170 
and the arms fall down and there is that
says<00:02:12.260> robot<00:02:12.650> mode<00:02:14.260> now<00:02:15.260> the<00:02:15.320> missile<00:02:15.890> is<00:02:16.180> the

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
says robot mode now the missile is the

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.990 
says robot mode now the missile is the
hook<00:02:17.390> this<00:02:18.350> was<00:02:18.680> a<00:02:18.709> pre-release<00:02:19.490> one<00:02:19.760> that

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
hook this was a pre-release one that

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.400 
hook this was a pre-release one that
didn't<00:02:20.270> come<00:02:20.450> in<00:02:20.570> the<00:02:20.660> packaging<00:02:21.080> that<00:02:21.110> I<00:02:21.260> got

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
didn't come in the packaging that I got

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:25.510 
didn't come in the packaging that I got
so<00:02:22.900> it<00:02:23.900> doesn't<00:02:24.380> have<00:02:24.500> the<00:02:24.680> string<00:02:24.950> I<00:02:25.160> think

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:25.520 
so it doesn't have the string I think

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.100 
so it doesn't have the string I think
the<00:02:25.670> final<00:02:25.880> design<00:02:26.300> is<00:02:26.600> supposed<00:02:26.870> to<00:02:26.930> have<00:02:27.020> a

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
the final design is supposed to have a

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:30.640 
the final design is supposed to have a
string<00:02:27.470> that's<00:02:27.650> attached<00:02:28.130> here<00:02:29.380> and<00:02:30.380> then<00:02:30.500> on

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
string that's attached here and then on

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.250 
string that's attached here and then on
the<00:02:30.740> back<00:02:30.920> so<00:02:31.490> it's<00:02:31.640> like<00:02:31.820> a<00:02:31.989> string<00:02:32.989> fired

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
the back so it's like a string fired

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:38.920 
the back so it's like a string fired
thing<00:02:36.760> that<00:02:37.760> this<00:02:38.150> hasn't<00:02:38.480> got<00:02:38.600> the<00:02:38.690> string

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
thing that this hasn't got the string

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:43.060 
thing that this hasn't got the string
because<00:02:39.230> mom<00:02:39.410> is<00:02:39.440> a<00:02:39.590> pre-release<00:02:40.040> so<00:02:42.070> anyway

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:43.070 
because mom is a pre-release so anyway

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:47.500 
because mom is a pre-release so anyway
to<00:02:43.750> just<00:02:44.750> five<00:02:45.290> an<00:02:45.470> assault<00:02:45.770> you<00:02:46.209> slow<00:02:47.209> it<00:02:47.239> in

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
to just five an assault you slow it in

00:02:47.510 --> 00:03:00.390 
to just five an assault you slow it in
here<00:02:49.150> and<00:02:50.800> a<00:02:54.610> little<00:02:55.610> button<00:02:55.910> on<00:02:56.120> the<00:02:56.300> top<00:02:56.510> line

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.240 

and<00:03:01.400> this<00:03:01.700> little<00:03:01.880> higher<00:03:02.150> out<00:03:02.360> and<00:03:03.100> it<00:03:04.100> goes

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
and this little higher out and it goes

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:06.430 
and this little higher out and it goes
pretty<00:03:04.459> far<00:03:04.700> as<00:03:04.850> well<00:03:05.030> on<00:03:05.299> this<00:03:05.450> hole<00:03:05.630> and<00:03:05.780> in

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.440 
pretty far as well on this hole and in

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.860 
pretty far as well on this hole and in
the<00:03:06.590> robot<00:03:06.950> mode<00:03:07.130> as<00:03:07.340> well<00:03:07.370> you<00:03:07.640> can<00:03:07.820> store<00:03:08.180> in

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870 
the robot mode as well you can store in

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:21.660 
the robot mode as well you can store in
