00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:59.350
 the 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.090
 once upon a time 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.689
 Nicolas 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:03.800
 with soul and what have you 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.800
 behind 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:53.750
 well they liked the internship so much 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:56.180
 super slouch they wanted to stay at 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:58.000
 see actually so that's back then 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:02.239
 I was lost and they are very good 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:04.250
 Ben listen to my hair on the stage they 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:05.569
 did not like it too much we will say that 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:06.980
 the hazing was successful because 

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:09.350
 it was the first time I 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:10.880
 had so short so no but after 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:12.739
 good impressions because in the end 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:16.450
 they push back even better so 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:18.590
 so we will be satisfied with what 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:20.630
 but it's a must for the 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:23.120
 again so it was hazing 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:26.450
 of grabbed all one by one and I 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:30.319
 I spent a first mach not want 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:32.660
 play but the stage here I went 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:37.459
 with a lot of hair so far but 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:38.510
 after ben I think they were a 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:41.150
 little disappointed since they left very 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:42.829
 so quickly so we'll say they are 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:43.480
 stayed at super slack so they are very 

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:46.670
 well 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:47.810
 they have no time to think there before 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:58.700
 to give some I was told 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:04:01.700
 cleared I said ok new adventure a 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:05.150
 maximum of success in so that's the beginning 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:07.540
 championship on September 16th and with 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:11.450
 a big shock and that's listening 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:13.980
 I hear I expect much 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:15.660
 I arrive heavy and it's true that it 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:17.609
 was pretty hard for two years because 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:20.280
 we did not have as good 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:21.450
 structure that knows and despite everything we have 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:23.760
 still managed to do something 

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:24.830
 of not too bad and when jambert he me 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:27.690
 proposed to come here 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:30.389
 samassa very motivated me by what he 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:33.000
 there is a concrete project and ambition and 

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:35.160
 so well I've always been I 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.419
 immediately been interested for me 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:38.850
 it's a big opportunity because 

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:41.400
 despite all this the system a system 

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:43.880
 bros and that would allow me to bounce a 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:46.550
 little and can come back 

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:48.440
 a good level what and I hope that 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:52.820
 I hope it will be good by the 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:56.300
 following to win matches of course 

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:57.620
 and then create a group for 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:01.430
 to set ourselves the goal we all 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:06.259
 well in cover spent a good season on 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:10.720
 is bringing added value to the club 

00:05:06.259 --> 00:05:12.810
 here and I try a lot 

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:16.420
 1000 and big project if that 

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:19.930
 interested me to come here and I both 

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:23.530
 that we will play at least the phase 

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:26.590
 final and maybe all I'm waiting for 

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:28.570
 make a good season with the goal 

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:30.160
 of qualification so I think we 

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:32.410
 has all agreed on this with 

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:33.430
 some reinforcements so we have I think 

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:33.790
 that we have a good group to do something 

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:35.620
 year thing 

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:37.720
 we still have a lot of work because 

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:38.470
 that we come we do the preparation so 

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:40.720
 it's the beginning of the season 

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:42.850
 and then you see and then for me 

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:46.870
 personally said to play a lot 

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:48.250
 is first to bring to Quebec we 

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:49.630
 win matches as much as we can 

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:53.160
 go into the final phase that we try to 

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:53.160
 live a beautiful with what
