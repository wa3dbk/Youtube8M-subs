00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:07.740
 hello to all of you guys in this video vi 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:12.200
 I'll show you how to mount the aux cable on 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:14.490
 a fiat big point with this way 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:18.199
 you can connect different devices 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:22.939
 to hear the music from the car radio 

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:25.050
 on my point the standard radio 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:28.679
 you can connect different devices 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:32.009
 to hear different music from CDs 

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:34.020
 first of all you have to check that the 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:37.550
 your point anyway your car 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:40.710
 raleigh in general is compatible with 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:44.670
 with the aux cable to do it enough 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:47.220
 turn on the radio and check with 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:51.440
 this case has already appeared if 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:51.440
 own example started from the fm radio 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:57.270
 extract the cd that is there if you have any 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:59.130
 One and double-press us to sedico 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.440
 barrea skit house then means that 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:04.769
 your car radio is compatible with the 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:07.289
 cable if you do not want to appear to say that 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:11.579
 it is not so do not buy not 

00:01:07.289 --> 00:01:15.179
 buy the aux cable that said that 

00:01:11.579 --> 00:01:18.869
 which you need given to turn off what 

00:01:15.179 --> 00:01:22.439
 you need is just this aux cable 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.609
 here I try just bought as soon as 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:28.439
 arrived from the internet but you can 

00:01:23.609 --> 00:01:30.990
 find at any here is here with 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:33.659
 jack at one end and the socket for 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:36.569
 connect it to the car radio on the other side 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:39.240
 you can easily find on the internet on 

00:01:36.569 --> 00:01:41.789
 and bay or on other sites or at and is 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.200
 between the trusted electrician or a shop 

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:45.780
 of electronics 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.659
 also with this envelope there was ho 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.520
 also found these 2 ferretti these 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:54.389
 here they are perfect here 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:56.850
 what are they used to extract the car radio 

00:01:54.389 --> 00:01:58.950
 they are very useful but if you don't have them 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.740
 you can also safely use two 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.710
 nails for example 2 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:05.869
 Spikes are very simple 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:10.180
 to use 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:18.050
 they are inserted in these two holes 

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:18.769
 this on the one hand all the way to the bottom 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:26.360
 same way 

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:33.650
 this I already had in this case 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:36.019
 I already had this stuck and then you can 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:39.590
 pull in this case as already mentioned 

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:41.750
 I have already extracted it you can extract here 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:44.989
 here the drawer with your hands 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:46.610
 these we can also be a 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:48.640
 very simple procedure first 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:51.590
 move as you have seen is enough 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:55.280
 take out the compartment containing 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:57.799
 completely remove the radio 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:02.120
 being careful now I'll do it 

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:07.959
 see being careful because when 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:15.970
 pull it out there is the lantern attached to 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:22.070
 be very careful and here it is 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:26.000
 leave with care and here it is one and another 

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:30.350
 once extracted you will have to go to insert 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:32.720
 the aux cable in these and here it is 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:37.640
 this is this compartment like these 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:43.100
 just plugs here you see that of 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:45.709
 same shape as the grip you will need 

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:47.299
 go and insert the socket in one of 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:52.540
 these three pins you can see here 

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:52.540
 are there are three I insert it here 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:57.530
 we see the verse as very simple 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:09.480
 that is roberto wrong here is here until 

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:12.989
 does not click at the moment is 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:15.400
 connected now to get more access 

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:18.489
 comfortable house cable 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:20.650
 just insert the cable at the end 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:25.570
 of the jack inside yours 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:31.199
 car radio there is a compartment that there 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:36.990
 allows you to pull the cable out from underneath 

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:36.990
 we suffer evening if we succeed 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:47.530
 you can practically this year there 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:52.530
 will allow to extract the head of water 

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:52.530
 below from below under the dashboard 

00:04:56.639 --> 00:05:03.699
 we have if we succeed acrobat 

00:04:59.289 --> 00:05:06.010
 here it is perfect and therefore in this 

00:05:03.699 --> 00:05:09.010
 so you will have as mentioned a more access 

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:12.690
 more facilitated more immediate 

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:16.000
 your club without having to leave 

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:17.440
 opened the compartment of the car radio and one 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.539
 once this operation is done here 

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:25.780
 not to disconnect anything you can 

00:05:19.539 --> 00:05:28.810
 reinsert the car radio maybe first 

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:31.500
 check that all that cable 

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:31.500
 functions 

00:05:32.139 --> 00:05:37.990
 here is here click here here you will have 

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:47.680
 your aux cable now we see immediately 

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:48.849
 if it works just connect any 

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:52.889
 device 

00:05:48.849 --> 00:05:52.889
 I wanted my mp3 player 

00:05:55.599 --> 00:06:01.360
 go down 

00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:02.310
 [Music] 

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:04.330
 this is the radio 

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:07.240
 [Music] 

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:09.449
 if now the first cd since there was no 

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:14.409
 cd the words aut 

00:06:09.449 --> 00:06:18.479
 here it is perfect if I turn up the volume 

00:06:14.409 --> 00:06:22.050
 you know that the volume also changes 

00:06:18.479 --> 00:06:22.050
 we have song 

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:33.580
 [Music] 

00:06:30.009 --> 00:06:36.550
 here is how you saw very simple 

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:38.630
 you can use the same procedure on 

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:40.970
 I also did it on several cars 

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:45.070
 on my big point I hope to be there 

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:45.070
 a greeting was useful to all bye
