00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:51.489
 violent in which from the past they have 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:53.799

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:57.340
 the law in the other municipalities of

 been working on all 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:41.729
 municipalities looking for but above all 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:44.490
 privilege the dialogue the concertation 

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:47.100
 as means for this kind of 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:49.169
 difference and that other concrete measures 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:50.190
 are going to be taken to maintain order 

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:53.310
 especially in these municipalities 

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:55.860
 secretaries we will act with a written 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:57.900
 adherence to the law with absolute respect 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:00.720
 to human rights but we will do it 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:03.479
 with an energy we can not allow that 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:06.320
 an electoral process a civic party 

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:09.330
 video will translate into violence 

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:11.490
 and methods of true vandalism like 

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:13.020
 those that were in another place and who 

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:15.120
 are behind these acts 

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:17.100
 mainly what are the lines of 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:19.950

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:25.470
 aware that he killed a hundred who 

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:28.680
 have headed this movement are 

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:33.090
 traditional leaders of the region who 

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:34.800
 have come to violence and in other 

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:37.350
 occasions have expressed disagreement 

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:40.320
 is that they have been taken care of 

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:42.810
 I personally have been several times 

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:44.910
 patient attending to the problems and 

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:47.190
 had been able to keep with them a 

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:50.480
 honest dialogue of closed they closed 

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:53.760
 to dialogue they resorted to anonymity 

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:56.550
 looking for a balaclava to commit 

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:57.720
 cowardly suicide comes from chestnut 

00:05:56.550 --> 00:06:01.400
