00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
this I'm gonna give you the overview but

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.830

if you watch your play it live she plays
it<00:00:46.140> a<00:00:46.350> little<00:00:46.920> bit<00:00:47.039> different<00:00:47.430> every<00:00:47.520> time<00:00:47.750> so

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
it a little bit different every time so

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.750 
it a little bit different every time so
don't<00:00:48.960> feel<00:00:49.200> like<00:00:49.500> if<00:00:49.890> that<00:00:50.250> something<00:00:50.489> was

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
don't feel like if that something was

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.369 
don't feel like if that something was
missed<00:00:51.030> in<00:00:51.180> the<00:00:51.270> tutorial<00:00:51.870> that<00:00:52.020> you're<00:00:52.140> doing

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
missed in the tutorial that you're doing

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:53.660 
missed in the tutorial that you're doing
something<00:00:52.680> wrong<00:00:52.890> or<00:00:53.070> I'm<00:00:53.219> doing<00:00:53.399> something

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
something wrong or I'm doing something

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.100 
something wrong or I'm doing something
wrong<00:00:54.000> she<00:00:54.570> just<00:00:54.690> plays<00:00:54.899> a<00:00:54.930> little

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
wrong she just plays a little

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.770 
wrong she just plays a little
differently<00:00:55.530> each<00:00:55.680> time<00:00:56.180> so<00:00:57.180> first<00:00:57.570> you<00:00:57.750> have

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
differently each time so first you have

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.319 
differently each time so first you have
the<00:00:57.899> a<00:00:58.079> minor<00:00:58.440> and<00:00:59.430> she<00:00:59.730> likes<00:00:59.910> to<00:01:00.000> do<00:01:00.149> that

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:03.870 
and then the I'm trying to think and

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:35.320

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630 
that's the whole thing

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:33.260 
that's the whole thing
Olo<00:03:28.020> and<00:03:28.380> then<00:03:28.500> you<00:03:28.590> just<00:03:28.800> end<00:03:29.010> on<00:03:30.080> C<00:03:31.490> G<00:03:32.490> so<00:03:33.240> I

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:33.270 
Olo and then you just end on C G so I

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:35.180 
Olo and then you just end on C G so I
think<00:03:33.480> the<00:03:33.900> important<00:03:34.380> thing<00:03:34.590> is<00:03:34.770> since<00:03:35.010> the

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
think the important thing is since the

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:37.790 
think the important thing is since the
chords<00:03:35.640> are<00:03:35.880> relatively<00:03:36.600> simple<00:03:37.080> I<00:03:37.260> think

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:37.800 
chords are relatively simple I think

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:42.110 
chords are relatively simple I think
it's<00:03:37.920> really<00:03:38.250> getting<00:03:38.850> that<00:03:40.610> intro<00:03:41.610> verse

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
it's really getting that intro verse

00:03:42.120 --> 00:04:03.800 
it's really getting that intro verse
part<00:03:48.410> it<00:03:49.410> is<00:03:49.560> really<00:03:50.130> mostly<00:03:50.670> eighth<00:03:51.060> notes

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:06.380 

now<00:04:04.620> remember<00:04:05.100> she<00:04:05.310> does<00:04:05.520> a<00:04:05.760> lot<00:04:06.090> of

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:06.390 
now remember she does a lot of

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:09.110 
now remember she does a lot of
embellishments<00:04:07.110> a<00:04:07.170> lot<00:04:07.350> of<00:04:07.560> hammer<00:04:08.010> ons<00:04:08.310> so

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 
embellishments a lot of hammer ons so

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:13.220 
embellishments a lot of hammer ons so
like<00:04:09.330> in<00:04:09.480> the<00:04:09.600> bridge<00:04:09.930> watch<00:04:10.319> that<00:04:10.620> see<00:04:12.230> she's

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:13.230 
like in the bridge watch that see she's

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:15.600 
like in the bridge watch that see she's
lifting<00:04:13.470> up<00:04:13.740> that<00:04:13.860> middle<00:04:14.100> finger<00:04:14.220> hammer

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:15.610 
lifting up that middle finger hammer

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:18.020 
lifting up that middle finger hammer
now

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.030 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:30.070 

so<00:04:18.690> sometimes<00:04:19.109> it's<00:04:19.290> nice<00:04:19.410> just<00:04:19.470> to<00:04:19.859> practice

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:30.080 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:35.450 

okay<00:04:31.940> my<00:04:32.940> head<00:04:33.120> is<00:04:33.270> elsewhere<00:04:33.930> right<00:04:34.230> now<00:04:34.460> in

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:35.460 
okay my head is elsewhere right now in

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:38.360 
okay my head is elsewhere right now in
la-la<00:04:35.850> land<00:04:35.880> I'm<00:04:36.270> sure<00:04:36.600> that's<00:04:36.840> a<00:04:37.050> shock<00:04:37.530> to

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:38.370 
la-la land I'm sure that's a shock to

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:40.130 
la-la land I'm sure that's a shock to
you<00:04:38.490> all<00:04:38.670> but<00:04:39.330> that's<00:04:39.540> the<00:04:39.750> whole<00:04:39.900> thing

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:40.140 
you all but that's the whole thing

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:41.750 
you all but that's the whole thing
that's<00:04:40.590> the<00:04:40.800> whole<00:04:40.920> thing<00:04:41.130> I<00:04:41.220> think<00:04:41.250> you<00:04:41.580> got

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:41.760 
that's the whole thing I think you got

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:45.760 
that's the whole thing I think you got
it<00:04:42.440> if<00:04:43.440> I<00:04:43.710> were<00:04:43.860> you<00:04:44.040> I<00:04:44.070> would<00:04:44.460> slow<00:04:45.150> this<00:04:45.480> down

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:45.770 
it if I were you I would slow this down

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:49.070 
it if I were you I would slow this down
so<00:04:46.770> that<00:04:46.920> you<00:04:47.040> can<00:04:47.220> get<00:04:47.400> that<00:04:47.580> opening<00:04:48.180> verse

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:49.080 
so that you can get that opening verse

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:51.770 
so that you can get that opening verse
they<00:04:49.650> opening<00:04:50.070> the<00:04:50.460> opening<00:04:50.610> riff<00:04:51.060> and<00:04:51.540> until

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:51.780
