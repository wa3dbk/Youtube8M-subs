00:02:11.579 --> 00:02:13.550 
difficult but I had a little bit of
experience<00:02:11.970> doing<00:02:12.299> the<00:02:12.510> CGI<00:02:12.870> stuff<00:02:13.260> for<00:02:13.470> the

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:16.079 
movie called Ted and then I realized

00:02:16.079 --> 00:02:18.470 
movie called Ted and then I realized
that<00:02:16.349> I<00:02:16.410> prefer<00:02:17.129> working<00:02:17.370> with<00:02:17.640> CGI

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
that I prefer working with CGI

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.470 
that I prefer working with CGI
characters<00:02:19.109> as<00:02:19.260> opposed<00:02:19.530> to<00:02:19.620> real<00:02:19.769> actors
