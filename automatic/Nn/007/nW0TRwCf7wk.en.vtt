the<00:00:17.970> first<00:00:18.270> thing<00:00:18.570> I<00:00:18.779> suggest<00:00:18.840> is<00:00:19.439> if<00:00:19.560> you<00:00:19.740> have

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
the first thing I suggest is if you have

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.849 
the first thing I suggest is if you have
blonde<00:00:20.400> or<00:00:20.789> highlighted<00:00:21.600> hair<00:00:21.840> is<00:00:22.020> to<00:00:22.619> take

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
blonde or highlighted hair is to take

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.089 
blonde or highlighted hair is to take
some<00:00:23.100> regular<00:00:23.430> body<00:00:23.970> lotion<00:00:24.630> and<00:00:24.869> just<00:00:25.650> apply

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
some regular body lotion and just apply

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:31.370 
some regular body lotion and just apply
it<00:00:26.130> to<00:00:26.400> your<00:00:26.880> hairline<00:00:27.439> and<00:00:29.570> to<00:00:30.570> your<00:00:30.990> brows
