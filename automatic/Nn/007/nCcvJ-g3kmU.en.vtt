00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
coat so I don't need to worry about that

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.929 
coat so I don't need to worry about that
I<00:01:28.320> then<00:01:28.710> use<00:01:28.860> my<00:01:29.040> dotting<00:01:29.250> tool<00:01:29.520> while<00:01:29.729> that's

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
I then use my dotting tool while that's

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.179 
I then use my dotting tool while that's
drying<00:01:30.180> and<00:01:30.659> just<00:01:31.200> add<00:01:31.350> some<00:01:31.380> random<00:01:31.950> dots

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
drying and just add some random dots

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.210 
drying and just add some random dots
with<00:01:32.460> the<00:01:32.490> same<00:01:32.790> colors<00:01:33.150> from<00:01:33.390> my<00:01:33.570> leaf

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:34.220 
with the same colors from my leaf

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:37.550 
with the same colors from my leaf
patterns<00:01:35.220> and<00:01:35.869> then<00:01:36.869> you'll<00:01:37.020> see<00:01:37.170> I<00:01:37.200> start

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
patterns and then you'll see I start

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.539 
patterns and then you'll see I start
adding<00:01:37.799> the<00:01:38.159> highlights<00:01:38.759> to<00:01:39.119> the<00:01:39.240> leaf<00:01:40.549> using

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
adding the highlights to the leaf using

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.730 
adding the highlights to the leaf using
a<00:01:41.610> thinner<00:01:41.820> of<00:01:42.030> brush<00:01:42.270> I<00:01:42.570> just<00:01:42.930> go<00:01:43.229> and<00:01:43.470> create

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
a thinner of brush I just go and create

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.679 
a thinner of brush I just go and create
kind<00:01:44.460> of<00:01:44.520> the<00:01:44.640> same<00:01:44.820> pattern<00:01:45.270> that<00:01:45.390> I<00:01:45.450> did

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
kind of the same pattern that I did

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.600 
kind of the same pattern that I did
originally<00:01:46.439> the<00:01:46.560> line<00:01:46.740> down<00:01:46.950> the<00:01:46.979> center<00:01:47.100> and

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
originally the line down the center and

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.270 
originally the line down the center and
then<00:01:47.670> pull<00:01:48.420> in<00:01:48.570> each<00:01:48.780> of<00:01:48.930> the<00:01:48.990> sides<00:01:49.280> i'm

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
then pull in each of the sides i'm

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.980 
then pull in each of the sides i'm
working<00:01:50.670> with<00:01:50.700> polish<00:01:51.180> it<00:01:51.329> dries<00:01:51.540> really<00:01:51.840> fast

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
working with polish it dries really fast

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.100 
working with polish it dries really fast
so<00:01:52.649> a<00:01:52.680> tip<00:01:52.979> is<00:01:53.280> take<00:01:53.939> your<00:01:54.090> nail<00:01:54.240> art<00:01:54.420> brush<00:01:54.659> dip

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110

it<00:01:55.229> in<00:01:55.320> acetone<00:01:55.799> and<00:01:55.829> then<00:01:56.219> run<00:01:56.430> it<00:01:56.549> through

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
it in acetone and then run it through

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.120 
it in acetone and then run it through
the<00:01:56.790> polish<00:01:57.210> and<00:01:57.450> that<00:01:57.479> way<00:01:58.290> it<00:01:58.530> stays<00:01:58.560> nice

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
the polish and that way it stays nice

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.100 
the polish and that way it stays nice
and<00:01:59.189> thin<00:01:59.579> easier<00:02:00.119> to<00:02:00.240> work<00:02:00.390> with<00:02:00.450> and<00:02:00.659> doesn't
