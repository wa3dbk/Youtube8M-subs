00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
gravity spike where he jumps in the air

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.990 
gravity spike where he jumps in the air
stabs<00:02:29.710> his<00:02:29.920> two<00:02:30.100> spikes<00:02:30.370> in<00:02:30.490> the<00:02:30.550> ground<00:02:30.730> calls

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
stabs his two spikes in the ground calls

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.850 
stabs his two spikes in the ground calls
the<00:02:31.210> super<00:02:31.690> pulse<00:02:31.930> that<00:02:32.140> kills<00:02:32.350> anyone<00:02:32.560> nearby

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
like this super speed we can run away

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.240 
like this super speed we can run away
there's<00:02:37.780> this<00:02:37.930> girl<00:02:38.170> too<00:02:38.350> has<00:02:38.530> it<00:02:38.800> where<00:02:39.010> she
