00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
and maybe just a little minor adjustment

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.799 
and maybe just a little minor adjustment
I<00:00:10.710> am<00:00:11.250> one<00:00:11.700> of<00:00:11.730> the<00:00:11.849> people<00:00:11.940> in<00:00:12.269> the<00:00:12.360> camp<00:00:12.630> of

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
I am one of the people in the camp of

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.279 
I am one of the people in the camp of
for<00:00:13.019> Wrestlemania<00:00:13.530> 29<00:00:13.710> thinking<00:00:14.610> that<00:00:14.790> this

00:00:15.279 --> 00:00:15.289 
for Wrestlemania 29 thinking that this

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:18.920 
for Wrestlemania 29 thinking that this
should<00:00:16.289> be<00:00:16.470> or<00:00:16.680> could<00:00:16.949> be<00:00:17.210> wrong<00:00:18.210> cover<00:00:18.480> Cena

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
should be or could be wrong cover Cena

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.779 
should be or could be wrong cover Cena
to<00:00:19.260> I<00:00:19.289> know<00:00:19.529> they<00:00:19.800> pumped<00:00:20.160> up<00:00:20.250> everything<00:00:20.640> for

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
to I know they pumped up everything for

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:22.189 
to I know they pumped up everything for
the<00:00:20.880> first<00:00:21.090> one<00:00:21.270> like<00:00:21.420> it<00:00:21.510> was<00:00:21.600> once<00:00:21.900> in<00:00:22.109> a

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
the first one like it was once in a

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.500 
the first one like it was once in a
lifetime<00:00:22.609> but<00:00:23.609> I'm<00:00:23.850> thinking<00:00:24.180> at<00:00:24.269> this<00:00:24.390> point

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
lifetime but I'm thinking at this point

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.200 
lifetime but I'm thinking at this point
right<00:00:24.869> here<00:00:25.189> it<00:00:26.189> is<00:00:26.250> the<00:00:26.550> match<00:00:26.730> that<00:00:27.029> makes

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
right here it is the match that makes

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:28.790 
right here it is the match that makes
the<00:00:27.330> most<00:00:27.510> sense<00:00:27.660> especially<00:00:27.990> was<00:00:28.439> seen<00:00:28.680> out

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
the most sense especially was seen out

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.700 
the most sense especially was seen out
losing<00:00:29.250> last<00:00:29.490> year<00:00:30.000> and<00:00:30.390> my<00:00:31.170> thoughts<00:00:31.439> on<00:00:31.619> the

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
losing last year and my thoughts on the

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.830 
losing last year and my thoughts on the
whole<00:00:31.859> booking<00:00:32.340> of<00:00:32.489> John<00:00:33.030> Cena<00:00:33.300> is<00:00:33.510> he<00:00:33.660> hasn't

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
whole booking of John Cena is he hasn't

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.100 
whole booking of John Cena is he hasn't
had<00:00:34.110> the<00:00:34.290> best<00:00:34.500> 2012<00:00:35.460> he<00:00:36.450> hasn't<00:00:36.780> really<00:00:36.899> been

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
had the best 2012 he hasn't really been

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.020 
had the best 2012 he hasn't really been
in<00:00:37.290> the<00:00:37.320> championship<00:00:38.190> picture<00:00:38.430> this<00:00:38.790> much

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
in the championship picture this much

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.389 
in the championship picture this much
this<00:00:39.590> should<00:00:40.590> be<00:00:40.710> one<00:00:40.860> of<00:00:40.920> the<00:00:41.040> very<00:00:41.070> first

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
this should be one of the very first

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:42.830 
this should be one of the very first
times<00:00:41.700> I<00:00:41.820> think<00:00:41.969> he's<00:00:42.059> had<00:00:42.210> a<00:00:42.239> championship

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
times I think he's had a championship

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.979 
times I think he's had a championship
match<00:00:43.550> since<00:00:44.550> being<00:00:44.789> out<00:00:45.059> of<00:00:45.090> mania<00:00:45.660> he<00:00:45.870> was

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
match since being out of mania he was

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.410 
match since being out of mania he was

as a his next feud but we've seen Cena
lose<00:01:28.799> a<00:01:29.100> whole<00:01:29.369> lot<00:01:29.579> more<00:01:29.790> this<00:01:30.600> year<00:01:30.630> than

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
lose a whole lot more this year than

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.359 
lose a whole lot more this year than
he's<00:01:31.140> lost<00:01:31.320> before<00:01:31.500> I<00:01:31.710> mean<00:01:31.950> even<00:01:32.159> with<00:01:32.250> the

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
he's lost before I mean even with the

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.460 
he's lost before I mean even with the
help<00:01:32.549> of<00:01:32.640> the<00:01:32.729> big<00:01:32.909> show<00:01:33.119> we<00:01:33.720> saw<00:01:33.900> him<00:01:34.079> lose<00:01:34.259> the

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
help of the big show we saw him lose the

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.520 
help of the big show we saw him lose the
John<00:01:34.710> Laurinaitis<00:01:35.220> and<00:01:35.720> I<00:01:36.720> think<00:01:37.290> that<00:01:37.409> they

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
John Laurinaitis and I think that they

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.280 
John Laurinaitis and I think that they
shorter<00:01:37.860> should<00:01:38.040> keep<00:01:38.280> this<00:01:38.720> streak<00:01:39.720> of<00:01:39.990> Cena

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
shorter should keep this streak of Cena

00:04:06.009 --> 00:04:06.019 
you know I know that it you know just

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:07.449 
you know I know that it you know just
being<00:04:06.229> in<00:04:06.409> a<00:04:06.469> match<00:04:06.620> with<00:04:06.919> the<00:04:07.040> rock<00:04:07.219> you<00:04:07.430> know

00:04:07.449 --> 00:04:07.459 
being in a match with the rock you know

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:08.679 
being in a match with the rock you know
gave<00:04:07.729> him<00:04:07.879> a<00:04:07.909> little<00:04:08.150> bit<00:04:08.269> but<00:04:08.479> you<00:04:08.629> know

00:04:08.679 --> 00:04:08.689 
gave him a little bit but you know

00:04:08.689 --> 00:04:09.999 
gave him a little bit but you know
actually<00:04:08.900> letting<00:04:09.259> him<00:04:09.469> beat<00:04:09.680> him<00:04:09.709> there's

00:04:09.999 --> 00:04:10.009 
actually letting him beat him there's

00:04:10.009 --> 00:04:11.289 
actually letting him beat him there's
one<00:04:10.219> reason<00:04:10.549> why<00:04:10.639> I<00:04:10.669> thought<00:04:10.849> he<00:04:11.000> was<00:04:11.120> really

00:04:11.289 --> 00:04:11.299 
one reason why I thought he was really

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:13.629 
one reason why I thought he was really
good<00:04:11.419> to<00:04:11.509> beat<00:04:11.599> him<00:04:11.719> last<00:04:11.870> time<00:04:12.049> on<00:04:12.489> but<00:04:13.489> it

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:13.639 
good to beat him last time on but it

00:04:13.639 --> 00:04:15.999 
good to beat him last time on but it
just<00:04:14.180> I<00:04:14.479> think<00:04:14.930> the<00:04:15.049> progression<00:04:15.739> of<00:04:15.799> John

00:04:15.999 --> 00:04:16.009 
just I think the progression of John

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:17.620 
just I think the progression of John
Cena<00:04:16.250> needs<00:04:16.519> to<00:04:16.609> be<00:04:16.729> like<00:04:16.909> he<00:04:17.060> almost<00:04:17.269> gets

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:17.630 
Cena needs to be like he almost gets

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:18.879 
Cena needs to be like he almost gets
there<00:04:17.870> but<00:04:18.019> he<00:04:18.109> can't<00:04:18.349> get<00:04:18.500> there<00:04:18.680> to<00:04:18.829> the

00:04:18.879 --> 00:04:18.889 
there but he can't get there to the

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:20.500 
there but he can't get there to the
point<00:04:19.099> where<00:04:19.219> he<00:04:19.340> realizes<00:04:19.729> that<00:04:19.909> you<00:04:20.150> know<00:04:20.269> he

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:20.510 
point where he realizes that you know he

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:23.050 
point where he realizes that you know he
has<00:04:20.690> to<00:04:20.870> beat<00:04:21.019> the<00:04:21.109> rock<00:04:21.320> on<00:04:21.590> I<00:04:22.400> don't<00:04:22.909> know

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:23.060 
has to beat the rock on I don't know

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:25.580 
has to beat the rock on I don't know
it's<00:04:23.690> hard<00:04:23.900> to<00:04:24.110> pinpoint

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:25.590 
it's hard to pinpoint

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:26.900 
it's hard to pinpoint
a<00:04:25.620> point<00:04:25.980> when<00:04:26.070> you<00:04:26.160> can<00:04:26.250> have<00:04:26.340> the<00:04:26.430> rock<00:04:26.610> come

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:26.910 
a point when you can have the rock come

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:29.420 
a point when you can have the rock come
back<00:04:27.120> a<00:04:27.150> lot<00:04:27.419> of<00:04:27.510> people<00:04:27.720> are<00:04:27.810> dreaming<00:04:28.430> about

final<00:05:26.100> four<00:05:26.400> and<00:05:26.550> everybody<00:05:26.880> thinking<00:05:27.150> that

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:27.360 
final four and everybody thinking that

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:29.330 
final four and everybody thinking that
you<00:05:27.539> know<00:05:27.600> he's<00:05:27.960> going<00:05:28.110> to<00:05:28.169> win<00:05:28.350> it<00:05:28.500> but<00:05:29.250> that's

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:29.340 
you know he's going to win it but that's

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:31.010 
you know he's going to win it but that's
the<00:05:29.460> one<00:05:29.669> time<00:05:29.910> for<00:05:30.120> John<00:05:30.270> Cena<00:05:30.300> to<00:05:30.690> come<00:05:30.840> room

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:31.020 
the one time for John Cena to come room

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:32.540 
the one time for John Cena to come room
and<00:05:31.139> running<00:05:31.530> down<00:05:31.650> and<00:05:31.889> eliminate<00:05:32.250> the<00:05:32.370> rock

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:32.550 
and running down and eliminate the rock

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:35.090 
and running down and eliminate the rock
to<00:05:33.450> get<00:05:33.600> on<00:05:33.750> his<00:05:33.930> radar<00:05:34.200> because<00:05:34.620> I<00:05:34.680> don't

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:35.100 
to get on his radar because I don't

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:36.350 
to get on his radar because I don't
think<00:05:35.160> you<00:05:35.340> can<00:05:35.460> sneak<00:05:35.580> the<00:05:35.880> rock<00:05:36.060> into

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:36.360 
think you can sneak the rock into

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:39.020 
think you can sneak the rock into
elimination<00:05:36.960> chamber<00:05:37.169> um<00:05:37.590> I<00:05:38.520> don't<00:05:38.940> even

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:39.030 
elimination chamber um I don't even

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:40.190 
elimination chamber um I don't even
think<00:05:39.180> you'd<00:05:39.360> have<00:05:39.389> them<00:05:39.570> in<00:05:39.720> a<00:05:39.750> singles<00:05:40.169> match

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:40.200 
think you'd have them in a singles match

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:41.540 
think you'd have them in a singles match
but<00:05:40.560> it<00:05:40.680> would<00:05:40.770> be<00:05:40.800> good<00:05:41.010> for<00:05:41.070> the<00:05:41.250> rock<00:05:41.400> to

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:41.550 
but it would be good for the rock to

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:43.580 
but it would be good for the rock to
jump<00:05:41.789> into<00:05:41.910> a<00:05:42.030> Royal<00:05:42.210> Rumble<00:05:42.330> he's<00:05:43.169> never<00:05:43.320> won

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:43.590 
jump into a Royal Rumble he's never won

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:45.620 
jump into a Royal Rumble he's never won
one<00:05:43.620> I<00:05:43.830> think<00:05:44.160> if<00:05:44.250> he<00:05:44.370> was<00:05:44.610> added<00:05:45.389> to<00:05:45.450> that<00:05:45.479> I

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:45.630 
one I think if he was added to that I

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:47.150 
one I think if he was added to that I
think<00:05:45.900> it<00:05:45.990> would<00:05:46.080> be<00:05:46.139> a<00:05:46.169> main<00:05:46.440> draw<00:05:46.710> people

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:47.160 
think it would be a main draw people
