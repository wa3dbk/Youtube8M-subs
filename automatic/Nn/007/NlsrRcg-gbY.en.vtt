00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:04.080 
okay now here is the bamboo pole or one

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.299 
okay now here is the bamboo pole or one
of<00:00:04.110> them<00:00:04.380> after<00:00:05.190> I've<00:00:05.310> cut<00:00:05.580> it<00:00:05.730> down<00:00:06.629> so<00:00:07.109> I<00:00:07.589> cut

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
of them after I've cut it down so I cut

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:11.089 
of them after I've cut it down so I cut
them<00:00:08.400> at<00:00:08.550> the<00:00:08.639> base<00:00:08.880> you<00:00:09.269> know<00:00:09.389> I<00:00:10.290> had<00:00:10.800> there's

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
them at the base you know I had there's

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:14.089 
them at the base you know I had there's
an<00:00:11.250> area<00:00:11.610> that<00:00:11.880> has<00:00:12.690> a<00:00:13.080> whole<00:00:13.500> stretch<00:00:13.889> of

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
an area that has a whole stretch of

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.510 
an area that has a whole stretch of
bamboo<00:00:14.549> back<00:00:14.969> there<00:00:15.269> at<00:00:16.170> the<00:00:16.350> far<00:00:16.830> edge<00:00:17.130> of<00:00:17.340> my

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
bamboo back there at the far edge of my

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.929 
bamboo back there at the far edge of my
yard<00:00:17.789> and<00:00:18.570> it's<00:00:19.500> relatively<00:00:20.130> well<00:00:20.430> contained

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
yard and it's relatively well contained

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:22.519 
yard and it's relatively well contained
you<00:00:21.510> know<00:00:21.600> which<00:00:21.750> is<00:00:21.900> important<00:00:22.410> because

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
you know which is important because

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.810 
you know which is important because
bamboo<00:00:23.070> can<00:00:23.880> be<00:00:24.029> invasive<00:00:24.480> and<00:00:24.990> can<00:00:25.170> get<00:00:25.380> out

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:25.820 
bamboo can be invasive and can get out

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:29.330 
bamboo can be invasive and can get out
but<00:00:26.820> fortunately<00:00:27.240> this<00:00:27.510> has<00:00:27.720> a<00:00:27.750> double<00:00:28.439> bamboo

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
but fortunately this has a double bamboo

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.659 
but fortunately this has a double bamboo
barrier<00:00:29.760> around<00:00:29.970> at<00:00:30.359> the<00:00:30.480> roots<00:00:31.369> so<00:00:32.369> we're

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
barrier around at the roots so we're

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.040 
barrier around at the roots so we're
keeping<00:00:32.910> an<00:00:33.000> eye<00:00:33.090> on<00:00:33.120> that<00:00:33.510> but<00:00:33.840> in<00:00:33.960> the

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
keeping an eye on that but in the

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.650 
keeping an eye on that but in the
meantime<00:00:34.880> you<00:00:35.880> know<00:00:35.940> some<00:00:36.149> of<00:00:36.180> the<00:00:36.300> bamboo

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
meantime you know some of the bamboo

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.660 
meantime you know some of the bamboo
stalks<00:00:37.170> who<00:00:37.500> you<00:00:38.190> know<00:00:38.280> will<00:00:38.430> go<00:00:38.910> dead<00:00:39.180> and<00:00:40.670> by

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
stalks who you know will go dead and by

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.459 
stalks who you know will go dead and by
stripping<00:00:42.270> by<00:00:42.540> cutting<00:00:42.960> them<00:00:43.110> down<00:00:43.140> at<00:00:43.379> the

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
stripping by cutting them down at the

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.380 
stripping by cutting them down at the
base<00:00:43.649> just<00:00:44.010> with<00:00:44.190> using<00:00:44.520> a<00:00:44.610> reciprocating<00:00:44.879> saw

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
base just with using a reciprocating saw

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.500 
base just with using a reciprocating saw
like<00:00:45.870> an<00:00:45.960> electric<00:00:46.289> saws<00:00:46.559> all<00:00:46.860> we<00:00:47.760> just<00:00:47.969> cut

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
like an electric saws all we just cut

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.810 
like an electric saws all we just cut
that<00:00:48.660> out<00:00:48.719> and<00:00:49.200> then<00:00:49.739> as<00:00:49.860> you<00:00:50.010> saw<00:00:50.190> a<00:00:50.340> moment<00:00:50.460> to

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
that out and then as you saw a moment to

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.630 
that out and then as you saw a moment to
go<00:00:50.969> I<00:00:51.480> use<00:00:52.050> an<00:00:52.199> axe<00:00:52.469> you<00:00:52.920> know<00:00:53.010> just<00:00:53.190> to<00:00:53.370> chop

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
go I use an axe you know just to chop

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.930 
go I use an axe you know just to chop
down<00:00:53.670> the<00:00:54.090> sides<00:00:54.329> to<00:00:54.660> get<00:00:54.750> rid<00:00:55.079> of<00:00:55.110> the<00:00:55.940> shoots

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
down the sides to get rid of the shoots

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.849 
down the sides to get rid of the shoots
or<00:00:57.300> branches<00:00:57.870> that<00:00:58.020> are<00:00:58.079> coming<00:00:58.410> out<00:00:58.500> on<00:00:58.710> each

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
or branches that are coming out on each

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.430 
or branches that are coming out on each
side<00:00:59.160> but<00:01:00.120> here<00:01:00.390> what<00:01:00.510> I'm<00:01:00.600> going<00:01:00.780> to<00:01:00.899> show<00:01:01.109> is

you<00:01:01.890> know<00:01:01.949> and<00:01:02.070> I<00:01:02.100> cut<00:01:02.309> this<00:01:02.460> one<00:01:02.670> about<00:01:03.390> six

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
you know and I cut this one about six

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:09.219 
you know and I cut this one about six
feet<00:01:03.989> up<00:01:04.260> and<00:01:04.670> here<00:01:05.670> I<00:01:06.290> left<00:01:07.290> a<00:01:07.619> few<00:01:08.580> of<00:01:08.760> these

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:09.229 
feet up and here I left a few of these

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:12.980 
feet up and here I left a few of these
where<00:01:10.229> they<00:01:10.380> branch<00:01:10.710> off<00:01:11.100> and<00:01:11.790> just<00:01:12.479> use<00:01:12.720> the

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
where they branch off and just use the

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.520 
where they branch off and just use the
my<00:01:13.200> little<00:01:13.619> hatchet<00:01:13.950> to<00:01:14.400> chop<00:01:15.000> them<00:01:15.439> you<00:01:16.439> know

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
why I left this Pete these little twigs

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.160 
why I left this Pete these little twigs
or<00:01:23.430> these<00:01:23.610> little<00:01:23.880> the<00:01:24.630> base<00:01:24.840> of<00:01:25.049> these

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
or these little the base of these

or these little the base of these
branches<00:01:25.710> shooting<00:01:26.070> out<00:01:26.220> on<00:01:27.060> this<00:01:27.299> particular

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
branches shooting out on this particular

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.880 
branches shooting out on this particular
spot<00:01:28.200> is<00:01:28.439> because<00:01:28.829> now<00:01:29.100> I<00:01:29.130> can<00:01:29.310> use<00:01:29.790> this<00:01:30.290> as<00:01:31.290> a

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
spot is because now I can use this as a

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.670 
spot is because now I can use this as a
support<00:01:32.640> system<00:01:32.909> so<00:01:33.540> i'll<00:01:34.110> show<00:01:34.350> you<00:01:34.409> what<00:01:34.560> i

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
support system so i'll show you what i

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.780 
support system so i'll show you what i
mean<00:01:34.710> i<00:01:34.920> have<00:01:35.340> out<00:01:35.549> here<00:01:36.079> this<00:01:37.079> spot<00:01:37.770> where<00:01:38.040> i'm

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
mean i have out here this spot where i'm

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.260 
mean i have out here this spot where i'm
growing<00:01:39.270> gourds<00:01:39.570> and<00:01:40.729> these<00:01:41.729> gourds<00:01:42.090> are

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
growing gourds and these gourds are

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.120 
growing gourds and these gourds are
growing<00:01:42.720> you<00:01:42.810> really<00:01:43.079> can<00:01:43.320> barely<00:01:43.770> see<00:01:44.009> it

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
growing you really can barely see it

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.990 
growing you really can barely see it
here<00:01:44.430> but<00:01:44.570> they're<00:01:45.570> growing<00:01:46.020> on<00:01:46.250> this<00:01:47.250> ramesh

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
here but they're growing on this ramesh

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.690 
here but they're growing on this ramesh
which<00:01:48.329> is<00:01:48.799> reinforcing<00:01:49.799> mesh<00:01:50.189> that's<00:01:50.490> used

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
which is reinforcing mesh that's used

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.350 
which is reinforcing mesh that's used
for<00:01:50.840> laying<00:01:51.840> down<00:01:52.189> concrete<00:01:53.189> this<00:01:54.060> is<00:01:54.180> like<00:01:54.329> a

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
for laying down concrete this is like a

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.550 
for laying down concrete this is like a
six<00:01:54.720> gauge<00:01:55.430> mesh<00:01:56.430> and<00:01:56.700> it<00:01:56.790> is<00:01:57.110> 10<00:01:58.110> feet<00:01:58.170> across

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
six gauge mesh and it is 10 feet across

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.539 
six gauge mesh and it is 10 feet across
and<00:01:59.100> five<00:01:59.159> feet<00:01:59.700> tall<00:02:00.409> and<00:02:01.409> this<00:02:01.590> is<00:02:01.770> six<00:02:02.280> gauge

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
and five feet tall and this is six gauge

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:06.770 
and five feet tall and this is six gauge
when<00:02:02.969> the<00:02:03.000> hole<00:02:03.390> is<00:02:03.630> six<00:02:04.200> inches<00:02:04.670> square<00:02:05.780> so

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
when the hole is six inches square so

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.350 
when the hole is six inches square so
you<00:02:06.869> can<00:02:07.020> reach<00:02:07.229> through<00:02:07.590> and<00:02:08.369> this<00:02:09.149> is

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
you can reach through and this is

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.479 
you can reach through and this is
starting<00:02:09.690> to<00:02:09.750> lean<00:02:10.110> it's<00:02:11.009> been<00:02:11.220> leaning

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
starting to lean it's been leaning

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.790 
starting to lean it's been leaning
because<00:02:11.940> of<00:02:12.090> the<00:02:12.209> weight<00:02:12.390> of<00:02:12.660> the

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
because of the weight of the

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.470 
because of the weight of the
words<00:02:13.950> the<00:02:14.280> vines<00:02:14.580> that<00:02:14.760> are<00:02:14.880> growing<00:02:15.150> on<00:02:15.450> it

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
words the vines that are growing on it

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.490 
words the vines that are growing on it
so<00:02:16.080> what<00:02:16.230> I'm<00:02:16.320> going<00:02:16.500> to<00:02:16.620> do<00:02:16.860> is<00:02:17.390> use<00:02:18.390> my<00:02:18.960> bamboo

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
so what I'm going to do is use my bamboo

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.880 
so what I'm going to do is use my bamboo
stakes<00:02:20.150> which<00:02:21.150> again<00:02:21.360> I'm<00:02:21.750> kind<00:02:22.110> of<00:02:22.200> recycling

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
stakes which again I'm kind of recycling

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.380 
stakes which again I'm kind of recycling
from<00:02:23.070> right<00:02:23.220> here<00:02:23.340> on<00:02:23.520> my<00:02:23.610> own<00:02:23.640> property<00:02:23.940> where

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
from right here on my own property where

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.900 
from right here on my own property where
I<00:02:24.420> have<00:02:24.540> bamboo<00:02:24.990> growing<00:02:25.680> I'm<00:02:26.430> going<00:02:26.610> to<00:02:26.700> use

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
I have bamboo growing I'm going to use

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.680 
I have bamboo growing I'm going to use
these<00:02:27.090> bamboo<00:02:27.390> stakes<00:02:28.850> like<00:02:29.850> so<00:02:30.210> i'll<00:02:30.480> show

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
these bamboo stakes like so i'll show

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:33.650 
these bamboo stakes like so i'll show
you<00:02:30.750> here<00:02:31.200> if<00:02:31.290> you<00:02:31.320> can<00:02:31.560> see<00:02:32.420> through<00:02:33.420> this

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
you here if you can see through this

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:38.420 
you here if you can see through this
through<00:02:34.260> all<00:02:34.350> of<00:02:34.380> these<00:02:34.620> vines<00:02:36.980> so<00:02:37.980> i'm<00:02:38.160> going

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
through all of these vines so i'm going

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:45.290 
through all of these vines so i'm going
to<00:02:38.900> use<00:02:39.900> this<00:02:43.430> scoop<00:02:44.430> those<00:02:44.640> little<00:02:45.060> branches

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
to use this scoop those little branches

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:48.230 
to use this scoop those little branches
that<00:02:46.080> I<00:02:46.140> was<00:02:46.380> just<00:02:46.620> showing<00:02:46.860> you<00:02:47.240> scooping

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:48.240 
that I was just showing you scooping

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:53.300 
that I was just showing you scooping
those<00:02:48.450> underneath<00:02:50.360> the<00:02:51.360> wire<00:02:51.630> mesh<00:02:52.280> so<00:02:53.280> that

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
those underneath the wire mesh so that

00:02:53.310 --> 00:03:01.130 
those underneath the wire mesh so that
now<00:02:53.730> it's<00:02:53.970> hooked<00:02:54.270> in<00:02:55.490> come<00:02:56.490> around<00:02:56.640> here<00:03:00.140> so

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
now it's hooked in come around here so

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:02.870 
now it's hooked in come around here so
you<00:03:01.230> can<00:03:01.500> see<00:03:01.740> how<00:03:01.770> okay<00:03:02.250> I<00:03:02.280> just<00:03:02.580> come<00:03:02.700> around

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
you can see how okay I just come around

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:06.290 
you can see how okay I just come around
to<00:03:03.030> the<00:03:03.150> other<00:03:03.180> side<00:03:03.360> you<00:03:04.260> can<00:03:04.440> see<00:03:04.470> how<00:03:04.860> I<00:03:05.300> hook

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 
to the other side you can see how I hook

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:08.210 
to the other side you can see how I hook
to<00:03:06.480> those<00:03:06.630> little<00:03:07.080> branches<00:03:07.380> right

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
to those little branches right

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:12.950 
to those little branches right
underneath<00:03:09.590> the<00:03:10.590> wire<00:03:11.370> mesh<00:03:11.760> here<00:03:12.210> against

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:12.960 
underneath the wire mesh here against

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:16.820 
underneath the wire mesh here against
the<00:03:13.760> metal<00:03:14.760> so<00:03:15.690> that<00:03:15.840> that<00:03:15.960> now<00:03:16.200> is<00:03:16.410> going<00:03:16.650> to

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:16.830 
the metal so that that now is going to

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:18.590 
the metal so that that now is going to
support<00:03:17.280> this<00:03:17.550> and<00:03:17.820> I'm<00:03:17.910> coming<00:03:18.120> back<00:03:18.239> around

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:18.600 
support this and I'm coming back around

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:25.660 
support this and I'm coming back around
again<00:03:18.930> and<00:03:21.380> then<00:03:22.380> I'll<00:03:23.100> just<00:03:23.160> give<00:03:23.610> this

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:25.670 
again and then I'll just give this

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:32.449 
again and then I'll just give this
another<00:03:26.670> kick<00:03:27.209> here<00:03:28.700> so<00:03:29.700> that<00:03:31.190> kind<00:03:32.190> of<00:03:32.250> move

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
another kick here so that kind of move

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:38.180 
another kick here so that kind of move
that<00:03:32.730> forward<00:03:34.820> so<00:03:35.820> that<00:03:35.850> now<00:03:36.470> that<00:03:37.470> fence<00:03:37.890> is

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
that forward so that now that fence is

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:42.080 
that forward so that now that fence is
you<00:03:39.000> know<00:03:39.090> that<00:03:39.239> fence<00:03:39.600> or<00:03:39.840> mesh<00:03:40.080> is<00:03:41.090> well

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
you know that fence or mesh is well

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:44.960 
you know that fence or mesh is well
supported<00:03:43.070> which<00:03:44.070> is<00:03:44.190> important<00:03:44.670> because<00:03:44.760> we

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
supported which is important because we

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:46.580 
supported which is important because we
have<00:03:45.060> a<00:03:45.090> hurricane<00:03:45.630> actually<00:03:46.020> coming<00:03:46.260> through

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
have a hurricane actually coming through

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:48.650 
have a hurricane actually coming through
here<00:03:46.830> in<00:03:46.980> a<00:03:47.070> couple<00:03:47.190> of<00:03:47.370> days<00:03:47.430> time<00:03:47.910> and<00:03:48.270> you

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660 
here in a couple of days time and you

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:50.300 
here in a couple of days time and you
can<00:03:48.780> see<00:03:48.959> I<00:03:48.989> did<00:03:49.230> the<00:03:49.350> same<00:03:49.380> with<00:03:49.800> a<00:03:49.860> couple<00:03:50.220> of

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
can see I did the same with a couple of

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:54.050 
can see I did the same with a couple of
other<00:03:50.780> bamboo<00:03:51.780> poles<00:03:52.110> here<00:03:52.709> the<00:03:53.580> same<00:03:53.790> type<00:03:54.030> of

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
other bamboo poles here the same type of

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:56.810 
other bamboo poles here the same type of
thing<00:03:54.209> so<00:03:54.720> again<00:03:55.590> just<00:03:55.620> a<00:03:55.920> really<00:03:56.220> easy<00:03:56.400> way<00:03:56.760> to

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:56.820 
thing so again just a really easy way to

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:01.790 
thing so again just a really easy way to
use<00:03:57.420> bamboo<00:03:58.730> if<00:03:59.730> you<00:03:59.940> are<00:04:00.470> fortunate<00:04:01.470> enough

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:08.100 
over but that is you know a resource for

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:11.240 
over but that is you know a resource for
