00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:12.750
 Hello everyone, so here it is, here and there 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:14.580
 returned after the summer break and does it 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.980
 there are the video point of view if 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.750
 not what the holiday but I 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.300
 in summer, in short, that heat is not that 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.070
 I cook great things I do these things 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:27.269
 cold and many in the rows and I already have them 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:30.150
 made to see and therefore in short now that 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:32.340
 he is a little bit better if he cooks 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.320
 a little longer ideas and studies cells 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.969
 also willingly oven because I think 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.300
 that this was the oven working at 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:41.010
 five times existing center not 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.969
 just when you must have infected 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:47.219
 a little bit then and today it gave way 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:50.399
 letting the user see a cake 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:53.670
 salt I do when it rains of fairies 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:55.739
 because it will be that I like it a lot 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.790
 and it is practically like redoing the 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.040
 Caprese, however, with him 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:02.410
 like cake as usual, the nanny who 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:07.140
 I propose it is very simple enough 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:10.000
 the expectation was in the air and it is 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.530
 clearly first thing is 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.870
 clearly what will follow us will be 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:16.480
 a cake pan because I still have it 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:18.160
 I make open use of this 

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:20.260
 tart mold that is great e 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:23.650
 they know how many will like it says so 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:25.960
 how many centimeters I think it will do 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:28.380
 oh well after apple tree I tell you then there 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.940
 serve two mozzarella 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.400
 you will see that however to feed and divided into 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:36.220
 a part of this the important thing that 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:38.020
 they are hard mozzarella in the sense 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:41.650
 that have little water to change so 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:44.979
 in cooking they do less then we need it 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:48.550
 I also put a little bit of oil in it 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:51.509
 oregano puff pastry clearly 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:55.479
 round the leaves of fresh basil 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:58.530
 and then the beef heart tomatoes 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:02:01.330
 clearly that I have already cut 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:04.180
 previously I'll show you 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:07.300
 clearly a quick summary of how I got it 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:09.790
 made cut tomatoes and slices 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:12.160
 or arranged in layers on the colander 

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:14.430
 the layers were alternated with salt 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:18.420
 to make the water lose first thing 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.420
 clearly roll 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:33.360
 try to reduce the fact that they do yes 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:33.360
 cook your little holes at all 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:44.230
 meanwhile the first mozzarella that is those 

00:02:41.409 --> 00:02:45.760
 rows and slices let's say thin but up to 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:48.120
 a certain point, in short, up to where it is 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.120
 arrives 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:58.270
 in the meantime I make these here 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:05.530
 denounce a little because they already have 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:07.360
 made the tac and void further now 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.760
 basically we don't have to do anything else 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:12.810
 than going to compose the savory pie 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:18.180
 here we have fun making the composition 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:18.180
 a small tomato and a piece 

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:30.630
 you must forget to tell yourself that left 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:32.370
 from the beginning, turn the oven on 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:34.340
 maximum so it warms up for good while 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:39.860
 the component 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:39.860
 now at this point I want to 

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:46.740
 the oregano clearly don't try to 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:51.480
 put because I had already put gods 

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:56.000
 fine tomatoes at the last mention the 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:56.000
 in the fresh basil leaves 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:04.810
 if the last thing I do is this 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:09.520
 maybe to fold the edges a little 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:12.400
 about yourself to close it here 

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:13.840
 and then it is ready to be the 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.850
 symphony 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:18.640
 now I cook it practically 

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:24.250
 five minutes with the oven at maximum 

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:27.670
 then the low up to 200 220 and I will 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:30.370
 I do 40 minutes for half an hour 

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:34.350
 it depends on how many hot the oven and you 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:37.090
 always adjust with the edge of the 

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:38.740
 of the cake because when it is well cooked the 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:41.800
 burgundy that begins to amaze that 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:44.620
 no amber color not yet brownish 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:47.680
 burned up means that it faces 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:50.620
 we meet again after an attack he occupies 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:52.510
 the finished result this just pulled 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:54.040
 out of the oven now when you have it 

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:55.240
 taken out of the oven it tastes like pizza 

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:57.400
 daisy that has a thing 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:59.410
 impressive 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:02.020
 I hope he liked it, I told you 

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:05.289
 it's a very simple thing very easy 

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:08.559
 to do maybe here they are 

00:05:05.289 --> 00:05:11.439
 make tomatoes with water though 

00:05:08.559 --> 00:05:13.439
 I think he has a simple fancy idea 

00:05:11.439 --> 00:05:16.659
 which is fine even maybe to make a 

00:05:13.439 --> 00:05:19.960
 aperitif an appetizer or maybe 

00:05:16.659 --> 00:05:22.449
 simply for dinner 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:24.699
 I advise you if you have way 

00:05:22.449 --> 00:05:26.949
 clearly to prepare it a little before 

00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:28.569
 serve moretta immense for an hour 

00:05:26.949 --> 00:05:31.990
 I saw him taste like this 

00:05:28.569 --> 00:05:34.119
 very much takes me the taste is everything 

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:37.389
 added good, even warm or cold 

00:05:34.119 --> 00:05:39.610
 in the summer for a problem and if maybe if 

00:05:37.389 --> 00:05:41.199
 with us it has cooled too you can 

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:43.509
 Always warm them instead of inside 

00:05:41.199 --> 00:05:46.659
 microwaves that you seem to know 

00:05:43.509 --> 00:05:51.159
 little in the surprise the pan 

00:05:46.659 --> 00:05:52.899
 what I can do for piadine and 

00:05:51.159 --> 00:05:54.320
 warm them up so I know they are informing 

00:05:52.899 --> 00:05:57.710
 delicate lover 

00:05:54.320 --> 00:06:00.410
 leaves it crunchy underneath and I hope nothing 

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:03.520
 which he saw was not liked as a mazzone e 

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:03.520
 see you soon. Bye
