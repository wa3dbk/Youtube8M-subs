00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.350
 my chosen one 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:13.320
 each step he carried carried within him 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:16.380
 truth from Allah and mercy for his 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:18.810
 slaves and aspiration with low not mercy 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:20.000

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.970
 exalted 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.950
 his every step was filled with meaning 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:28.160
 noble feet were bleeding 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:30.770
 from stones thrown into him in taif he 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:33.410
 was stoned to such an extent that 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:34.940
 he had to stop but they 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:37.720
 forcibly raised him 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:40.150
 and he continued on his way 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:42.190
 the beating didn't stop him again 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:44.980
 had to stop 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:47.440
 so they raised it three times at that 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.780
 time they threw stones at him and he 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:51.790
 was bleeding until he came to 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:55.300
 tree in the garden and did not complain 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:58.840
 to my lord I complain to you about my 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:03:01.720
 weakness and lack of opportunity he does not 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:04.180
 said i'm complaining to you about the people of taif not 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:06.280
 said and complained to you of the inhabitants of mecca and 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:07.780
 I did not say that I complain about those who 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:10.360
 treats me rudely 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:12.610
 I complain to you about my weakness and 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:15.040
 lack of opportunities and on his 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:16.960
 weakness before the people you are god 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:18.350
 oppressed so on who are you me 

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:20.300
 will leave 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:22.910
 until jibril has asked for permission 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:25.250
 turn to him telling him that allah 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:27.230
 sent an angel of mountains he approached 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:30.110
 greeted the prophet balance catching him 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:32.620
 with flax and said I heard rejection 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:36.020
 your people and what they say 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:38.270
 tell me what you want if you want 

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:42.080
 i crush them between these two greats 

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:45.020
 In the mountains, he said no, I want Allah 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:46.870
 made their descendants by those who join 

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:48.879
 my ummah 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:52.290
 we know that a person can be a friend 

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:54.810
 someone and between them is love 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:55.819
 he thinks only about him but does not think about 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:58.530
 his children 

00:03:55.819 --> 00:04:02.040
 but even if he thinks about his children 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:04.260
 then he thinks about those who are but 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.480
 think of other children who are not yet 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:09.200
 were born 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:11.690
 it's a strange thing nonetheless he thinks 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:14.930
 about future children of people who are not 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:16.940
 are his friends more than that 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:19.430
 people who showed hostility by 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:22.650
 relation to him and drove him stones 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:26.110
 nevertheless he thinks of their descendants 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:28.240
 how great are the mercies of compassion 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:31.629
 blue steps and salalallahu alayhi wa 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:35.319

00:04:31.629 --> 00:04:37.750
 them mercy to us from god always wish 

00:04:35.319 --> 00:04:40.330
 only good for the ummah he did not 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:43.330
 not a single step thinking about the mind 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:46.230
 praying for the mind did not pass and night 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:48.780
 lest he cry for the mind 

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:50.580
 whether the prophetâ€™s life has come to us 

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:53.550
 Vassallo heal that one 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:55.710
 day he was pleased and still daughter abu 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:57.270
 bakra be very few and therefore 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:05:00.480
 he prayed for her 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:03.720
 tree forgive our daughter abu bakra all her 

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:07.110
 sins and past and future and hidden and 

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:08.520
 explicit she was glad to this prayer and and 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:11.940
 happiness was obvious 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:14.010
 he asked her you are happy she said 

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:16.180
 how can i be unhappy when you 

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:17.949
 pray for me that way 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:21.070
 then the prophet salalallahu alayhi wa sallam 

00:05:17.949 --> 00:05:25.270
 and said by Allah this is my prayer 

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:26.710
 for my umma every night his steps where 

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:30.009

 swords your home to market to the gathering places 

00:05:30.009 --> 00:05:35.020

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:36.370
 mercy and compassion and good for 

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:40.270

 legs 

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:55.610
 may Allah make us steadfast on 

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:55.610
