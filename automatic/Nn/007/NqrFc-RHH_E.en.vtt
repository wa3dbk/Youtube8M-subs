can<00:01:02.550> learn<00:01:02.879> a<00:01:02.910> lot<00:01:03.239> about<00:01:03.449> ourselves<00:01:03.809> through

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
can learn a lot about ourselves through

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.010 
can learn a lot about ourselves through
the<00:01:04.830> workings<00:01:05.309> and<00:01:05.489> teamwork<00:01:05.820> of<00:01:06.360> an<00:01:06.479> animated

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
the workings and teamwork of an animated

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.039 
the workings and teamwork of an animated
and<00:01:07.409> colony<00:01:08.100> I<00:01:08.340> realize<00:01:09.180> it's<00:01:09.390> an<00:01:09.479> animated

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
and colony I realize it's an animated

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:11.660 
and colony I realize it's an animated
movie<00:01:10.200> and<00:01:10.500> it's<00:01:10.619> about<00:01:10.830> ants<00:01:11.100> and<00:01:11.460> all<00:01:11.520> these

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
movie and it's about ants and all these

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.030 
movie and it's about ants and all these
things<00:01:11.909> but<00:01:12.090> it<00:01:12.210> really<00:01:12.360> kind<00:01:13.200> of<00:01:13.380> does<00:01:13.680> touch

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
things but it really kind of does touch

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.560 
things but it really kind of does touch
a<00:01:14.070> little<00:01:14.369> bit<00:01:14.490> on<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:15.979> the<00:01:16.979> greater

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:17.570 
a little bit on the the greater

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:21.050 
a little bit on the the greater
political<00:01:19.100> problems<00:01:20.100> that<00:01:20.310> we<00:01:20.400> have<00:01:20.670> that

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
political problems that we have that

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:27.109 
political problems that we have that
nothing<00:01:21.780> is<00:01:21.960> sort<00:01:22.170> of<00:01:23.000> really<00:01:26.119> attended

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
nothing is sort of really attended

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.710 
nothing is sort of really attended
everything<00:01:27.780> is<00:01:27.900> just<00:01:28.080> reacted<00:01:28.770> to<00:01:28.979> and<00:01:29.689> so<00:01:30.689> I

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
everything is just reacted to and so I

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.060 
everything is just reacted to and so I
think<00:01:30.840> that's<00:01:31.079> you<00:01:31.470> know<00:01:31.500> when<00:01:31.740> you<00:01:31.829> kind<00:01:31.950> of

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
think that's you know when you kind of

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.149 
think that's you know when you kind of
learn<00:01:32.250> about<00:01:32.490> these<00:01:32.729> ant<00:01:33.000> colonies<00:01:33.630> and<00:01:33.900> how

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:34.159 
learn about these ant colonies and how

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:37.850 
learn about these ant colonies and how
they<00:01:35.159> work<00:01:35.640> and<00:01:35.939> how<00:01:36.150> the<00:01:36.210> people<00:01:36.659> really<00:01:37.079> rely

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
they work and how the people really rely

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.370 
they work and how the people really rely
on<00:01:38.009> each<00:01:38.250> other<00:01:38.490> and<00:01:38.759> and<00:01:39.210> that's<00:01:40.140> how<00:01:40.320> the

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
on each other and and that's how the

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.850 
on each other and and that's how the
whole<00:01:40.710> thing<00:01:40.759> exists<00:01:41.759> and<00:01:41.909> works<00:01:42.200> that<00:01:43.200> um<00:01:43.560> I

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
whole thing exists and works that um I

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.190 
whole thing exists and works that um I
think<00:01:44.490> that's<00:01:44.820> a<00:01:44.970> good<00:01:45.149> lesson<00:01:45.570> for<00:01:45.600> humans

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
think that's a good lesson for humans

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.219 
think that's a good lesson for humans
