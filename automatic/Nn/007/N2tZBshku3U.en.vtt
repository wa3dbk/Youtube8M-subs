designed to manage water we've been

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.950 
designed to manage water we've been
building<00:00:35.160> the<00:00:35.340> program<00:00:35.520> since<00:00:35.820> 1996<00:00:36.719> and

building the program since 1996 and

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.920 
building the program since 1996 and
we've<00:00:37.170> installed<00:00:37.649> 85<00:00:38.309> acres<00:00:38.550> of<00:00:39.090> green<00:00:39.809> space

we've installed 85 acres of green space

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.959 
we've installed 85 acres of green space
in<00:00:40.320> the<00:00:40.410> roadbed<00:00:40.800> and<00:00:41.070> in<00:00:41.489> the<00:00:41.550> past<00:00:41.700> five

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
in the roadbed and in the past five

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.310 
in the roadbed and in the past five
years<00:00:42.210> we've<00:00:42.329> start<00:00:42.690> to<00:00:42.809> experiment<00:00:43.050> with

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
years we've start to experiment with

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.040 
years we've start to experiment with
storm<00:00:43.620> water<00:00:43.680> capture<00:00:44.059> techniques<00:00:45.059> in<00:00:45.539> order

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
storm water capture techniques in order

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.069 
storm water capture techniques in order
to<00:00:46.280> reduce<00:00:47.280> CSOs<00:00:47.789> and<00:00:48.030> bring<00:00:48.239> water<00:00:48.570> into<00:00:48.660> our

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
to reduce CSOs and bring water into our

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.260 
to reduce CSOs and bring water into our
indoor<00:00:49.530> gardens<00:00:49.980> and<00:00:50.250> this<00:00:50.489> is<00:00:50.640> a<00:00:50.670> one<00:00:51.120> of<00:00:51.210> the

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
indoor gardens and this is a one of the

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.569 
indoor gardens and this is a one of the
reasons<00:00:51.570> we<00:00:51.960> created<00:00:52.590> a<00:00:52.680> relationship<00:00:53.430> with

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
reasons we created a relationship with

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.490 
reasons we created a relationship with
Drexel<00:00:53.910> University<00:00:54.539> to<00:00:54.840> evaluate<00:00:55.350> the

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
Drexel University to evaluate the

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.200 
Drexel University to evaluate the
effectiveness<00:00:55.890> of<00:00:56.190> our<00:00:56.309> designs<00:00:56.670> and<00:00:56.910> how<00:00:57.000> if

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
effectiveness of our designs and how if

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.240 
effectiveness of our designs and how if
they're<00:00:57.360> actually<00:00:57.750> capturing<00:00:58.140> stormwater<00:00:59.039> as

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
they're actually capturing stormwater as

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.250 
they're actually capturing stormwater as
intended<00:00:59.780> so<00:01:00.780> there's<00:01:00.960> many<00:01:01.109> different

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
intended so there's many different

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.429 
intended so there's many different
benefits<00:01:01.770> that<00:01:02.309> are<00:01:02.460> associated<00:01:03.120> with<00:01:03.600> urban

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
benefits that are associated with urban

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.250 
benefits that are associated with urban
greening<00:01:04.739> programs<00:01:05.420> and<00:01:06.420> those<00:01:06.990> can<00:01:07.229> include

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
greening programs and those can include

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.950 
greening programs and those can include

many<00:01:14.909> of<00:01:15.090> these<00:01:15.240> services<00:01:16.140> on<00:01:16.500> benefits<00:01:17.220> are

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
many of these services on benefits are

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.520 
many of these services on benefits are
directly<00:01:18.270> linked<00:01:18.689> with<00:01:18.869> evaporative

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
directly linked with evaporative

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.289 
directly linked with evaporative
processes<00:01:20.330> most<00:01:21.330> notably<00:01:22.400> evaporation<00:01:23.400> is<00:01:23.640> a

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
processes most notably evaporation is a

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.539 
processes most notably evaporation is a
process<00:01:24.810> that<00:01:25.049> consumes<00:01:25.619> heat<00:01:26.040> and<00:01:26.310> energy

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
process that consumes heat and energy

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.410 
process that consumes heat and energy
and<00:01:27.090> when<00:01:28.080> that<00:01:28.500> occurs<00:01:28.920> you<00:01:29.490> reduce<00:01:30.090> the

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
and when that occurs you reduce the

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.679 
and when that occurs you reduce the
temperature<00:01:30.930> of<00:01:31.500> the<00:01:32.159> surrounding<00:01:32.880> air<00:01:33.150> mass

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
temperature of the surrounding air mass

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.830 
temperature of the surrounding air mass
so<00:01:34.259> by<00:01:35.040> having<00:01:35.280> green<00:01:36.000> spaces<00:01:36.329> like<00:01:36.810> this

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
so by having green spaces like this

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.920 
so by having green spaces like this
throughout<00:01:37.350> the<00:01:37.650> city<00:01:37.860> you<00:01:38.369> can<00:01:38.549> reduce

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:38.930 
throughout the city you can reduce

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:41.210 
throughout the city you can reduce
what's<00:01:39.930> referred<00:01:40.320> to<00:01:40.500> as<00:01:40.680> the<00:01:40.860> urban<00:01:41.189> heat

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
what's referred to as the urban heat

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.819 
what's referred to as the urban heat
island<00:01:41.820> effect<00:01:41.909> whereby<00:01:42.479> cities<00:01:43.020> tend<00:01:43.409> to<00:01:43.680> be

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
island effect whereby cities tend to be

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.010 
island effect whereby cities tend to be
several<00:01:44.430> degrees<00:01:44.729> warmer<00:01:45.329> than<00:01:45.360> surrounding

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
several degrees warmer than surrounding

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.710 
several degrees warmer than surrounding
rural<00:01:46.200> areas<00:01:46.829> so<00:01:47.520> our<00:01:47.700> research<00:01:48.030> is<00:01:48.210> trying<00:01:48.390> to

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
rural areas so our research is trying to

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.470 
rural areas so our research is trying to
document<00:01:48.930> how<00:01:49.920> well

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:50.480 
document how well

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:53.620 
document how well
technologies<00:01:51.760> approaches<00:01:52.760> like<00:01:52.940> this<00:01:53.120> are

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:53.630 
technologies approaches like this are

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.320 
technologies approaches like this are
for<00:01:54.230> managing<00:01:54.650> stormwater<00:01:54.890> in<00:01:55.430> in<00:01:56.060> urban

this research is how we bring this

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.610 
this research is how we bring this
together<00:02:48.830> so<00:02:49.670> how<00:02:49.880> do<00:02:49.940> we<00:02:50.240> sort<00:02:50.960> of<00:02:51.050> shape<00:02:51.380> the

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
together so how do we sort of shape the

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:53.800 
together so how do we sort of shape the
future<00:02:51.650> of<00:02:52.010> urban<00:02:52.370> ecosystems<00:02:53.090> through<00:02:53.600> the

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
interesting parts of this is trying to

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:04.860 
interesting parts of this is trying to
really<00:03:02.140> get<00:03:02.290> back<00:03:02.530> to<00:03:02.740> some<00:03:03.870> relevant
