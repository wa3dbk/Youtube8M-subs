00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:08.400
 good is material that we are going to need 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:12.860
 is a linear cup size letter I use 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:17.420
 this having the defect as this 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:19.650
 wrapping paper can already be sheet 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:22.519
 decorated as slaves 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:25.519
 this scissors glue something to do 

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:25.519
 circles 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:31.059
 and what you want to decorate the card 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:34.160
 The first thing we are going to do is take 

00:00:31.059 --> 00:00:36.670
 our downspout and we're going to double it 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.670
 half 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:44.370
 and here we have it fold in half the 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.680
 let's set aside and let's start 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:50.570
 to make spheres 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:54.170
 and I will use this paper 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:58.570
 and this to mark the circle so good 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:01:01.530
 I'm going to open my paper 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:05.330
 and I will put very circle 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:09.470
 and I'm going to start marking yes 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:13.870
 I'm going to need four circles to 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:13.870
 a sphere so in total signal 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:24.540
 ready and yellow my eight cycles also 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.090
 on a piece of cardboard I'm going to mark 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:31.009
 two other circles that are going to do the 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.009
 bases of the spheres 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:38.700
 and since we have marked them what 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.700
 let's do is start cutting them 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:50.720
 good since cut of my eight circles 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:53.180
 and the two bases we're going to start first 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:56.380
 with the first sphere 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.380
 what we are going to do 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:02.940
 what we are going to do is take our 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:05.560
 circles and we are going to bend by the 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:08.349
 half left 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:10.679
 the design we want for the part of 

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:10.679
 above 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:20.140
 and that we are going to do with all 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.140
 - with the base 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:27.510
 Well, what we are going to do is take 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.510
 our glue 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:35.590
 and we are going to put glue to a part 

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:35.590
 one half of a circle 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:45.140
 and we're going to hit it with others 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.560
 this way 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:04.330
 and so we are going to do it with another 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:04.330
 we are going to put glue 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:09.390
 let's see it 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:34.129
 they will have something like this more or less and 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:34.129
 we already hit the last 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:52.260
 and this will leave us without glue and 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:56.540
 already when opening it 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:59.799
 we would be like a sphere in 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:59.799
 3 be more or less 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:08.750
 of comfortable life and then what are they going to 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:08.750
 do is paste the to our base 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:28.639
 and ready and we leave 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:33.610
 is what 

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:33.610
 and we do in doing the same 

00:04:35.849 --> 00:04:40.619
 now since we have our two 

00:04:37.559 --> 00:04:44.689
 finished spheres 

00:04:40.619 --> 00:04:44.689
 let's take our card 

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:50.540
 and we are going to paste 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:54.750
 well first let's accommodate and see in 

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:58.580
 where do we want our spheres 

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:58.580
 I will place them like this 

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:04.430
 and we're going to take our glue and 

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:04.430
 let's stick them 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:12.650
 after a help 

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:12.650
 of one of them 

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:22.639
 and a fine tip down 

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:24.720
 I'm going to close again and I'm going to do it here 

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:30.350
 A line 

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:30.350
 as if it were the thread of the sphere 

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:38.910
 you can draw here a bow tie for 

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:40.470
 do it with a ribbon or put the 

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:44.030
 consistency that is put to the 

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:44.030
 spheres that the market has 

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:51.790
 I'm going to put this time 

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:51.790
 as the appointment 

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:59.320
 and ready now what follows is decorating 

00:05:56.710 --> 00:06:02.220
 our 

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:02.220
 card 

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:17.950
 Y 

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:35.270
 and that is how it is and it is ready for 

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:36.980
 let's write what we want here 

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:39.200
 and well, you liked the 

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:41.680
 tutorial we'll see you next bye and 

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:41.680
 Merry Christmas
