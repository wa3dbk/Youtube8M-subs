00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:14.270
 and let me tell you everything I love you 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:14.270
 to tell you everything I think 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:24.740
 The first thing we have to know is the 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:27.830
 correct correct clamping of the 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:29.480
 scissors the scissors has two rings one 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:31.100
 colita that they have to locate 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.560
 the fingers 

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:34.680
 annular will go in the ring that contains 

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:37.290
 politics 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:40.800
 the thumbs on the other ring the 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:47.629
 little finger where is the little tail 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:47.629
 the scissors rest be honest we have 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.190
 as the hand is used this new 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.690
 position 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:55.040
 we can not hold the scissors of this 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:58.060
 way 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:00.070
 because we have one finger left over 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:01.630
 neither are we going to sustain the figure of 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:05.850
 this way because we totally lose 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:05.850
 control and those that do not 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:12.890
 there is always the usual position 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.890
 bad to this new position 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:19.990
 once we learn this we have to 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:22.840
 learn to move it by this movement 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:24.579
 of the scissors and it's going to be the next 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.679
 we have to achieve with the 

00:01:24.579 --> 00:01:28.920
 time to move a single branch of the scissors 

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:32.039
 the branches controlled by the thumb 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:34.990
 the rest of the hand remains still 

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:36.520
 relaxed does not last but relaxed but 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:40.329
 still 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:42.899
 the finger that controls the movement this 

00:01:40.329 --> 00:01:42.899
 what we have to achieve 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:48.520
 to be able to achieve this there are 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:50.109
 several exercises that we can go like this 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.030
 the first one we are going to do with the 

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:54.609
 scissors in the air we take it 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:56.829
 we can correctly place ourselves in this 

00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:59.740
 position and we are going to do the following 

00:01:56.829 --> 00:02:02.409
 relaxing the hand paying attention to 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:05.229
 relax the hand with the maintenance of the 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:08.990
 movements of opening and closing and 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:12.230
 opening and closing slowly 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:13.780
 interesting here is the quality of 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:17.110
 movement 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:19.940
 not the speed we open and close we go 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:21.830
 to stretch the tendon a little 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:24.260
 as long as it is necessary for us 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:26.380
 we can keep doing this going to 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.380
 be 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:32.489
 another exercise can be the following 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:36.040
 we are going to need a table for this 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:37.910
 we place the hand let's hear about 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.350
 table 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:43.140
 now let's place in the hand 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:45.740
 correctly held by our hand 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:48.570
 let's hold them 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:50.280
 firmly on the table and we're going 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:54.600
 taking into account the movements of 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:56.590
 opening and decision of space open 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:58.239
 we already saw 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:00.190
 in this way we force the rest of 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:01.720
 brothers to stay still 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:04.030
 the amateur hand between the table and 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:08.220
 our other hand that has us and what 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:08.220
 Unique is the finger opens and closes 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:15.570
 how long we can do this 

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:15.570
 slowly 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:20.160
 another exercise that we can do is the 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:22.260
 next we also need the table 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:26.050
 that we are going to use as a house roof 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:27.940
 let's do this let's place 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:29.920
 the scissors resting on the roof of the 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:31.450
 table 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:33.910
 you go to the branches under dawn 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:36.450
 still then now we have to do 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:38.710
 this we open 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:40.930
 and April 

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:43.060
 in this way the branches remain 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:44.890
 still stone works on the table and 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:47.080
 does not allow it to move we have 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:49.510
 to concentrate on leaving the hand that 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:52.799
 she is relaxed 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:52.799
 and we open land 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:57.780
 slowly every time we give 

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:04.710
 the next exercise we are also going to 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:08.640
 use the table and let's do this 

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:11.320
 let's take the branch stays still 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:14.490
 We will take it as close as possible 

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:16.770
 of the table without touching them 

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:18.100
 and making the opening movements 

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:19.470
 initial 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:23.560
 then we are going to do the following 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:24.940
 first let's make different 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:27.940
 I dont know 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:29.660
 the arrival to the mass we are going to go 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:32.110
 going forward 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:33.970
 following the police 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:36.400
 when we come to a corner the 

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:39.360
 we follow and follow the flower 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:39.360
 all of them 

00:04:40.009 --> 00:04:44.029
 one X and we are going to change position 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:46.390
 we are going to put it upside down 

00:04:44.029 --> 00:04:48.360
 for rock 

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:50.729
 and the exercise of it 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:53.219
 the branch that remains still and stuck to 

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:56.380
 the table without touching it and let's go 

00:04:53.219 --> 00:04:58.690
 advancing on the table like this 

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:00.850
 all around the table we are giving 

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:02.590
 turns to give a mass so we can 

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:06.040
 also use any piece of furniture that 

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:08.200
 be a vertical position where there 

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:10.530
 curves and we continue as following all 

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:10.530
 the forms 

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:16.420
 for the next exercise we are going to 

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:18.790
 need a cylinder that can be this 

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:22.140
 it can be a bottle 

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:22.140
 we have in front of us 

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:27.809
 and we are going to do the following 

00:05:24.689 --> 00:05:29.549
 we put the scissors in front and we go to 

00:05:27.809 --> 00:05:33.260
 do this the opening moves and 

00:05:29.549 --> 00:05:36.500
 of closing advancing and retreating 

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:39.800
 well close to the cylinder without touching them and 

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:42.190
 we move forward and back and down and 

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:42.190
 we advance 

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:49.090
 and we advance we go back to where the 

00:05:46.419 --> 00:05:51.280
 of the joint 

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:53.290
 from our own breaststroke 

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:56.950
 once we got to where not 

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:59.830
 we have can not get more we go back to 

00:05:56.950 --> 00:06:01.690
 start up but we turn the scissors and 

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:03.569
 we're going to work the other way around and we're going to 

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:06.869
 do the same 

00:06:03.569 --> 00:06:10.589
 we advance we go back and down and 

00:06:06.869 --> 00:06:13.630
 we move forward and back and down and 

00:06:10.589 --> 00:06:15.849
 we advance and go back 

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:17.990
 it is important to learn to work 

00:06:15.849 --> 00:06:20.580
 different 

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:22.680
 and backwards 

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:25.050
 it's okay it's quite important 

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:29.030
 front I'm working in this way and 

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:29.030
 upside down I'm working this way 

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:32.310
 it's an exercise that's why with a little 

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:34.680
 boring 

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:36.810
 They are tiresome to the bike but if they are going to 

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:38.550
 stop all the tendon part the rest 

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:39.960
 hand but they are useful to do is 

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:43.010
 the only way to learn to control 

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:43.010
 correctly the scissors 

00:06:49.349 --> 00:06:53.430
 and yes
