minutes or something just take no and
turn<00:02:38.609> off<00:02:38.730> your<00:02:38.760> system<00:02:39.180> but<00:02:39.299> anyway<00:02:39.659> here

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
turn off your system but anyway here

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.490

again<00:02:40.620> is<00:02:41.000> the<00:02:42.000> health<00:02:42.180> of<00:02:42.269> the<00:02:42.329> system<00:02:42.750> of<00:02:43.170> the

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
again is the health of the system of the

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.830 
again is the health of the system of the
battery<00:02:44.180> second<00:02:45.180> one<00:02:45.269> from<00:02:45.389> the<00:02:45.450> top<00:02:45.540> the

battery second one from the top the

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.940 
battery second one from the top the
primary<00:02:46.170> battery<00:02:46.469> health<00:02:46.709> was<00:02:47.430> that<00:02:47.609> 92%<00:02:48.889> mmm

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
primary battery health was that 92% mmm

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.629 
primary battery health was that 92% mmm
this<00:02:50.760> fix<00:02:51.090> it<00:02:51.299> after<00:02:51.420> running<00:02:51.750> this<00:02:51.930> test<00:02:52.639> so

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:53.639 
this fix it after running this test so

00:02:53.639 --> 00:02:55.309 
this fix it after running this test so

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 
you can run this test again it should be

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:16.159 
you can run this test again it should be
be<00:03:10.980> at<00:03:11.159> 100%<00:03:11.790> or<00:03:12.120> 99%<00:03:13.609> should<00:03:14.609> be<00:03:14.930> this<00:03:15.930> worked
