00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:05.000 
those later yeah this is probably like

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.390 
those later yeah this is probably like
700<00:01:06.000> eggs<00:01:06.330> I<00:01:06.750> think<00:01:07.049> something<00:01:08.010> around<00:01:08.220> there

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
700 eggs I think something around there

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.719 
700 eggs I think something around there
anyway<00:01:09.380> yeah<00:01:10.380> I've<00:01:10.530> breaking<00:01:11.040> lots<00:01:11.430> of<00:01:11.580> eggs

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
anyway yeah I've breaking lots of eggs

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.630 
anyway yeah I've breaking lots of eggs
and<00:01:12.000> I<00:01:12.030> have<00:01:12.240> not<00:01:12.420> found<00:01:12.720> a<00:01:12.960> single<00:01:12.990> a<00:01:13.640> single

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
and I have not found a single a single

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.730 
and I have not found a single a single
donut<00:01:15.090> from<00:01:15.210> any<00:01:15.420> of<00:01:15.509> them<00:01:15.689> so<00:01:15.960> I<00:01:16.170> don't<00:01:16.680> know

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
donut from any of them so I don't know

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.350 
donut from any of them so I don't know
the<00:01:16.860> chances<00:01:17.250> really<00:01:17.430> of<00:01:17.640> finding<00:01:18.000> any<00:01:18.119> of<00:01:18.299> the

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
the chances really of finding any of the

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.420 
the chances really of finding any of the
eggs<00:01:18.540> and<00:01:18.810> donuts<00:01:19.170> I<00:01:19.350> can<00:01:19.470> really<00:01:19.710> look<00:01:20.220> into

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
eggs and donuts I can really look into

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.760 
eggs and donuts I can really look into
it<00:01:20.610> for<00:01:20.759> you<00:01:20.820> guys<00:01:21.030> but<00:01:21.330> I'm<00:01:21.619> probably<00:01:22.619> just

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
it for you guys but I'm probably just

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.580 
it for you guys but I'm probably just
going<00:01:22.979> to<00:01:23.070> say<00:01:23.310> that<00:01:23.340> it's<00:01:23.640> slim<00:01:24.060> to<00:01:24.210> none

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:24.590 
going to say that it's slim to none

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:27.469 
going to say that it's slim to none
because<00:01:25.590> I<00:01:25.770> have<00:01:26.040> never<00:01:26.430> found<00:01:26.759> any<00:01:27.090> donuts

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
because I have never found any donuts

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.600 
because I have never found any donuts
for<00:01:27.570> many<00:01:27.750> eggs<00:01:27.990> and<00:01:28.320> nobody<00:01:28.950> else<00:01:29.189> that<00:01:29.490> I've

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
for many eggs and nobody else that I've

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.030 
for many eggs and nobody else that I've
really<00:01:29.909> heard<00:01:30.150> of<00:01:30.329> has<00:01:30.540> but<00:01:31.350> if<00:01:31.470> you<00:01:31.560> have<00:01:31.770> just

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
really heard of has but if you have just

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.550 
really heard of has but if you have just
telling<00:01:32.310> me<00:01:32.369> so<00:01:32.520> we<00:01:32.640> can<00:01:32.729> at<00:01:32.850> least<00:01:32.970> you<00:01:33.329> know

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560 
telling me so we can at least you know

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.230 
telling me so we can at least you know
make<00:01:34.560> sure<00:01:34.770> we<00:01:34.950> that<00:01:34.979> this<00:01:35.369> statement<00:01:35.880> is<00:01:35.970> true

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
make sure we that this statement is true

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.740 
make sure we that this statement is true
if<00:01:36.570> not<00:01:37.380> that<00:01:37.650> it's<00:01:37.799> probably<00:01:38.189> either<00:01:38.790> I<00:01:39.210> mean

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
if not that it's probably either I mean

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.149 
if not that it's probably either I mean
I<00:01:39.840> don't<00:01:40.140> think<00:01:40.320> that<00:01:40.409> they<00:01:40.500> would<00:01:40.590> just<00:01:40.650> put

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
I don't think that they would just put

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.530 
I don't think that they would just put
that<00:01:41.189> in<00:01:41.400> the<00:01:41.490> game<00:01:41.700> and<00:01:41.850> be<00:01:42.000> fake<00:01:42.270> like<00:01:42.299> I

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
that in the game and be fake like I

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:43.550 
that in the game and be fake like I
don't<00:01:42.689> think<00:01:42.869> that<00:01:42.990> they're<00:01:43.110> being<00:01:43.259> that

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
don't think that they're being that

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.770 
don't think that they're being that
stingy<00:01:43.920> with<00:01:44.189> their<00:01:44.340> donuts<00:01:44.759> but<00:01:45.060> to<00:01:45.659> be

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
stingy with their donuts but to be

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.450 
stingy with their donuts but to be
honest<00:01:46.079> they<00:01:46.350> probably<00:01:46.590> made<00:01:46.799> it<00:01:46.979> such<00:01:47.130> a<00:01:47.159> high

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
honest they probably made it such a high

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.179 
honest they probably made it such a high
ratio<00:01:47.790> like<00:01:48.420> it's<00:01:49.110> probably<00:01:49.290> like<00:01:49.530> a<00:01:49.560> 1<00:01:49.890> in

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
ratio like it's probably like a 1 in

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:53.600 
ratio like it's probably like a 1 in
like<00:01:50.399> a<00:01:50.640> thousand<00:01:51.240> chance<00:01:51.530> which<00:01:52.530> is<00:01:52.950> really

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
like a thousand chance which is really

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.480 
like a thousand chance which is really
ridiculous<00:01:53.880> but<00:01:54.570> I<00:01:54.840> don't<00:01:55.710> know<00:01:55.799> it's<00:01:55.920> EA<00:01:56.130> for

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
ridiculous but I don't know it's EA for

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.569 
ridiculous but I don't know it's EA for
you<00:01:56.640> but<00:01:56.880> if<00:01:57.840> anybody<00:01:58.290> does<00:01:58.530> find<00:01:58.860> any<00:01:59.070> eggs<00:01:59.310> in

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
you but if anybody does find any eggs in

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:02.450 
you but if anybody does find any eggs in
any<00:01:59.700> other<00:01:59.850> donuts<00:02:00.360> or<00:02:00.689> any<00:02:01.619> donuts<00:02:02.159> in<00:02:02.340> their

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
see if this is actually true I mean I'm

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.370 
see if this is actually true I mean I'm
not<00:02:56.520> really<00:02:56.580> doubting<00:02:57.210> that<00:02:57.240> it<00:02:57.450> is<00:02:57.600> true<00:02:57.930> but

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
not really doubting that it is true but

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.590 
not really doubting that it is true but
I<00:02:58.680> mean<00:02:59.310> I<00:02:59.460> don't<00:02:59.730> think<00:03:00.150> that<00:03:00.360> they<00:03:00.510> would

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:00.600 
I mean I don't think that they would

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.210 
I mean I don't think that they would
just<00:03:00.660> put<00:03:01.110> it<00:03:01.230> in<00:03:01.320> there<00:03:01.380> just<00:03:01.680> fool<00:03:01.890> everybody

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
but all I'm saying is it's probably a

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:07.820 
but all I'm saying is it's probably a
really<00:03:05.120> really<00:03:06.120> low<00:03:06.510> chance<00:03:07.260> of<00:03:07.470> getting<00:03:07.770> a

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
really really low chance of getting a

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:12.770 
really really low chance of getting a
donut<00:03:08.250> I<00:03:08.630> don't<00:03:09.630> know<00:03:09.750> but<00:03:10.380> I<00:03:10.910> have<00:03:11.910> no<00:03:12.090> idea<00:03:12.240> so
