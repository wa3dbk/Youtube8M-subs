the halfway point actually of this
slightly<00:00:16.800> ambitious<00:00:17.550> series<00:00:17.760> so<00:00:18.630> from<00:00:19.140> now<00:00:19.230> on

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410

all<00:00:19.560> we<00:00:19.680> have<00:00:19.830> left<00:00:19.980> is<00:00:20.160> the<00:00:20.430> dark<00:00:20.760> world<00:00:21.029> that

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
all we have left is the dark world that

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.810 
all we have left is the dark world that
really<00:00:21.359> only<00:00:22.140> gets<00:00:22.680> better<00:00:23.039> from<00:00:23.369> here

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
really only gets better from here

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.630 
undersell it cuz you're watching it
right<00:00:30.720> now<00:00:31.050> but<00:00:31.260> there's<00:00:31.980> not<00:00:32.130> as<00:00:32.279> much<00:00:32.430> room

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
right now but there's not as much room

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.930 
right now but there's not as much room
for<00:00:32.690> ingenuity<00:00:33.690> as<00:00:33.870> there<00:00:34.739> was<00:00:34.950> in<00:00:35.309> the

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
for ingenuity as there was in the

the salt factory but in any case as the

3 dark world that are actually harder
than<00:00:49.789> hell<00:00:50.789> or<00:00:51.030> the<00:00:51.180> rapture<00:00:51.570> then<00:00:51.750> we<00:00:51.840> see

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
than hell or the rapture then we see

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.740 
than hell or the rapture then we see
some<00:00:52.199> more<00:00:52.520> some<00:00:53.520> more<00:00:53.550> opportunities<00:00:54.420> for

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
some more some more opportunities for

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.139 
some more some more opportunities for
innovation<00:00:55.020> let's<00:00:55.770> put<00:00:55.980> it<00:00:56.070> that<00:00:56.100> way<00:00:56.219> some

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
innovation let's put it that way some

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.599 
innovation let's put it that way some
more<00:00:57.270> areas<00:00:57.719> where<00:00:57.829> Steve<00:00:58.829> has<00:00:59.070> the<00:00:59.219> ability

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
more areas where Steve has the ability

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.330 
more areas where Steve has the ability
to<00:00:59.820> completely<00:01:00.270> break<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:00.899> game<00:01:01.190> and<00:01:02.190> turn

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
to completely break the game and turn

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.609 
to completely break the game and turn
the<00:01:02.489> levels<00:01:02.760> to<00:01:02.820> the<00:01:02.940> kind<00:01:03.120> of<00:01:03.180> a<00:01:03.270> joke<00:01:03.570> get<00:01:04.530> it

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
the levels to the kind of a joke get it

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.760 
the levels to the kind of a joke get it
my<00:01:04.710> least<00:01:04.979> favorite<00:01:05.460> obstacles<00:01:06.470> right<00:01:07.470> as<00:01:07.650> you

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
my least favorite obstacles right as you

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.200 
my least favorite obstacles right as you
can<00:01:07.890> see<00:01:08.010> right<00:01:08.159> now<00:01:08.310> are<00:01:08.460> ones<00:01:08.700> that<00:01:08.850> are

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
can see right now are ones that are

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.270 
can see right now are ones that are
actually<00:01:09.750> really<00:01:10.080> easy<00:01:10.380> to<00:01:10.619> do<00:01:10.740> with<00:01:10.920> meatboy

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
actually really easy to do with meatboy

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.670 
actually really easy to do with meatboy
but<00:01:11.549> I<00:01:11.580> just<00:01:11.760> kind<00:01:11.939> of<00:01:12.000> punish<00:01:12.840> myself<00:01:13.409> and

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
but I just kind of punish myself and

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.010 
but I just kind of punish myself and
make<00:01:13.830> them<00:01:14.010> harder<00:01:14.369> like<00:01:14.610> it<00:01:15.270> should<00:01:15.570> not<00:01:15.750> be

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
make them harder like it should not be

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.780 
make them harder like it should not be
nearly<00:01:16.380> this<00:01:16.650> hard<00:01:16.890> for<00:01:16.979> me<00:01:17.189> to<00:01:17.280> break<00:01:17.729> that

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
nearly this hard for me to break that

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.580 
nearly this hard for me to break that
top<00:01:18.180> block<00:01:18.450> and<00:01:18.630> get<00:01:18.689> the<00:01:18.810> bandage<00:01:19.140> girl<00:01:19.170> but<00:01:19.560> I

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
top block and get the bandage girl but I

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:20.179 
top block and get the bandage girl but I
seem<00:01:19.890> to<00:01:19.920> be

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
seem to be

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.330 
seem to be
it's<00:01:20.970> like<00:01:21.150> watching<00:01:21.780> Rain<00:01:22.710> Man<00:01:22.740> try<00:01:23.280> to

levels<00:03:04.250> in<00:03:04.430> chapter<00:03:04.790> 3<00:03:05.120> in<00:03:05.330> the<00:03:05.420> dark<00:03:05.600> world

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
levels in chapter 3 in the dark world

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.770

and<00:03:06.080> in<00:03:06.680> chapter<00:03:07.010> 2<00:03:07.160> as<00:03:07.340> well<00:03:07.519> but<00:03:08.360> for<00:03:08.540> here

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:08.780 
and in chapter 2 as well but for here

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:10.150 
and in chapter 2 as well but for here
there's<00:03:09.050> not<00:03:09.170> a<00:03:09.230> lot<00:03:09.380> of<00:03:09.530> soft<00:03:09.830> rolling

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:10.160 
there's not a lot of soft rolling

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:13.210 
there's not a lot of soft rolling
actually<00:03:10.730> except<00:03:11.180> I<00:03:11.630> think<00:03:11.870> on<00:03:11.989> 118<00:03:12.860> there's<00:03:13.130> a

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 
actually except I think on 118 there's a

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:16.330 
actually except I think on 118 there's a
little<00:03:13.459> bit<00:03:13.580> but<00:03:14.360> I<00:03:14.390> actually<00:03:15.070> probably<00:03:16.070> end

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:16.340 
little bit but I actually probably end

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:18.160 
little bit but I actually probably end
up<00:03:16.489> killing<00:03:16.550> myself<00:03:17.000> more<00:03:17.450> often<00:03:17.810> when<00:03:17.930> I<00:03:17.989> try

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.170 
up killing myself more often when I try

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:19.810 
up killing myself more often when I try
to<00:03:18.200> block<00:03:18.410> saws<00:03:18.800> than<00:03:19.100> I<00:03:19.190> end<00:03:19.459> up<00:03:19.580> saving

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:19.820 
to block saws than I end up saving

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:22.630 
to block saws than I end up saving
myself<00:03:20.060> so<00:03:20.540> it's<00:03:20.690> kind<00:03:20.989> of<00:03:21.080> not<00:03:21.260> worth<00:03:21.440> it<00:03:21.640> but

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:22.640 
myself so it's kind of not worth it but

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:24.310 
myself so it's kind of not worth it but
you<00:03:22.700> know<00:03:22.820> you<00:03:23.030> don't<00:03:23.510> use<00:03:23.690> Steve<00:03:24.019> because

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:24.320 
you know you don't use Steve because

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:25.570 
you know you don't use Steve because
it's<00:03:24.470> practical<00:03:24.650> you<00:03:25.130> use<00:03:25.310> steel<00:03:25.550> because

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:25.580 
it's practical you use steel because

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:26.500 
it's practical you use steel because
it's<00:03:26.030> funny

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.510 
it's funny

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:29.440

video game who is weak tonight I can't
think<00:03:43.370> of<00:03:43.400> another<00:03:43.459> great<00:03:43.880> example<00:03:45.489> hmm<00:03:46.489> just

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:47.360 
think of another great example hmm just

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.630 
think of another great example hmm just
get<00:03:47.510> past<00:03:47.780> these<00:03:48.200> saws<00:03:48.590> that<00:03:49.220> would<00:03:49.459> be<00:03:49.610> a

phone<00:03:50.380> this<00:03:51.380> is<00:03:51.799> one<00:03:51.980> where<00:03:52.160> the<00:03:52.340> solution<00:03:52.880> the

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:53.450 
phone this is one where the solution the

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:56.289 
phone this is one where the solution the
Steve<00:03:53.690> Way<00:03:53.959> is<00:03:54.650> a<00:03:54.709> lot<00:03:55.280> more<00:03:55.430> roundabout<00:03:55.910> than

00:03:56.289 --> 00:03:56.299 
Steve Way is a lot more roundabout than

00:03:56.299 --> 00:03:59.470 
Steve Way is a lot more roundabout than
the<00:03:57.070> solution<00:03:58.070> the<00:03:58.160> meat<00:03:58.310> boy<00:03:58.459> way<00:03:58.670> and<00:03:58.880> here's

00:03:59.470 --> 00:03:59.480 
the solution the meat boy way and here's

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:01.630 
the solution the meat boy way and here's
one<00:03:59.720> where<00:03:59.930> it's<00:04:00.170> much<00:04:00.590> much<00:04:00.830> more<00:04:00.890> direct<00:04:01.489> you

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:01.640 
one where it's much much more direct you

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:02.800 
one where it's much much more direct you
basically<00:04:01.940> just<00:04:02.030> tunnel<00:04:02.510> under<00:04:02.720> that

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:02.810 
basically just tunnel under that

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:04.660 
basically just tunnel under that
mountain<00:04:03.049> and<00:04:03.410> jump<00:04:03.650> up<00:04:03.739> to<00:04:03.920> the<00:04:03.980> club<00:04:04.220> it

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:04.670 
mountain and jump up to the club it

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:06.430 
mountain and jump up to the club it
varies<00:04:05.209> you<00:04:05.360> know<00:04:05.450> sometimes<00:04:05.959> Steve<00:04:06.170> is

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:06.440 
varies you know sometimes Steve is

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:07.990 
varies you know sometimes Steve is
practical<00:04:07.040> sometimes<00:04:07.430> he's<00:04:07.610> not

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:08.000 
practical sometimes he's not

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000 
practical sometimes he's not
all<00:04:08.600> right<00:04:08.690> it<00:04:08.750> was<00:04:08.780> 118<00:04:09.500> that's<00:04:09.769> the<00:04:09.860> level

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:10.010 
all right it was 118 that's the level

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:11.230 
all right it was 118 that's the level
I'm<00:04:10.220> referring<00:04:10.580> to

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:11.240 
I'm referring to

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:13.930 
I'm referring to
cause<00:04:11.600> so<00:04:12.440> you<00:04:12.500> can<00:04:12.650> see<00:04:12.860> that<00:04:13.040> on<00:04:13.550> display

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:13.940 
cause so you can see that on display

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:16.240 
cause so you can see that on display
right<00:04:14.300> now<00:04:14.480> you<00:04:15.140> can<00:04:15.320> block<00:04:15.530> these<00:04:15.710> sauce<00:04:15.980> as

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:16.250 
right now you can block these sauce as

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:17.979 
right now you can block these sauce as
long<00:04:16.400> as<00:04:16.520> you<00:04:16.670> get<00:04:17.090> your<00:04:17.209> timing<00:04:17.420> down<00:04:17.570> and

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:17.989 
long as you get your timing down and

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:20.410 
long as you get your timing down and
then<00:04:18.860> you<00:04:18.950> can<00:04:19.070> jump<00:04:19.459> into<00:04:19.640> the<00:04:19.820> sauce<00:04:20.060> as<00:04:20.270> well

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:20.420 
then you can jump into the sauce as well

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:22.030 
then you can jump into the sauce as well
if<00:04:20.630> that's<00:04:20.840> kind<00:04:21.110> of<00:04:21.140> your<00:04:21.380> if<00:04:21.680> that's<00:04:21.920> your

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:22.040 
if that's kind of your if that's your

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:23.680 
if that's kind of your if that's your
prerogative<00:04:22.190> I<00:04:22.640> mean<00:04:22.790> I<00:04:22.820> wanted<00:04:23.270> to<00:04:23.330> jump<00:04:23.570> in

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:23.690 
prerogative I mean I wanted to jump in

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:25.600 
prerogative I mean I wanted to jump in
that<00:04:23.810> into<00:04:24.080> that<00:04:24.230> saw<00:04:24.470> I<00:04:24.770> could<00:04:25.340> have<00:04:25.430> gotten

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:25.610 
that into that saw I could have gotten

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:27.870 
that into that saw I could have gotten
around<00:04:25.880> it<00:04:26.030> I<00:04:26.090> just<00:04:26.150> didn't<00:04:26.480> feel<00:04:26.630> like<00:04:26.690> it

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:27.880 
around it I just didn't feel like it

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:30.970 
around it I just didn't feel like it
will<00:04:28.880> block<00:04:29.150> it<00:04:29.300> again<00:04:29.570> oh<00:04:29.750> that<00:04:30.350> was<00:04:30.470> so<00:04:30.680> cheap

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:30.980 
will block it again oh that was so cheap

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:33.850 
will block it again oh that was so cheap
it<00:04:31.130> just<00:04:31.280> came<00:04:31.490> right<00:04:31.640> through<00:04:31.700> the<00:04:32.030> blog<00:04:32.800> so<00:04:33.800> I

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:33.860 
it just came right through the blog so I

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:35.350 
it just came right through the blog so I
guess<00:04:34.040> maybe<00:04:34.250> I<00:04:34.400> doesn't<00:04:34.880> have<00:04:35.090> a<00:04:35.150> hundred

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:35.360 
guess maybe I doesn't have a hundred

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:38.170 
guess maybe I doesn't have a hundred
percent<00:04:35.540> efficacy<00:04:36.290> at<00:04:37.040> blocking<00:04:37.490> sauce<00:04:37.910> and

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:38.180 
percent efficacy at blocking sauce and

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:40.570 
percent efficacy at blocking sauce and
maybe<00:04:38.330> that<00:04:38.540> saw<00:04:39.320> animation<00:04:40.040> starts<00:04:40.430> a<00:04:40.490> little

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:40.580 
maybe that saw animation starts a little

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:42.820 
maybe that saw animation starts a little
bit<00:04:40.790> past<00:04:41.000> the<00:04:41.210> block<00:04:41.420> I<00:04:41.720> say<00:04:42.440> things<00:04:42.680> like

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:42.830 
bit past the block I say things like

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:44.650 
bit past the block I say things like
that<00:04:42.890> like<00:04:43.220> I<00:04:43.310> have<00:04:43.340> any<00:04:43.610> idea<00:04:43.970> how<00:04:44.240> this<00:04:44.270> game

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:44.660 
that like I have any idea how this game

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:46.150 
that like I have any idea how this game
is<00:04:44.810> programmed<00:04:45.320> or<00:04:45.560> how<00:04:45.680> games<00:04:45.980> are

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:46.160 
is programmed or how games are

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:48.340 
is programmed or how games are
programmed<00:04:46.610> in<00:04:46.760> general<00:04:47.120> but<00:04:47.330> I<00:04:47.390> don't<00:04:47.600> so<00:04:48.110> I

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:48.350 
programmed in general but I don't so I

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:52.270 
programmed in general but I don't so I
don't<00:04:49.160> know<00:04:49.270> team<00:04:50.270> meat<00:04:50.630> you<00:04:50.900> got<00:04:51.860> me<00:04:52.040> once

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:52.280 
don't know team meat you got me once

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:54.070 
don't know team meat you got me once
again<00:04:52.550> even<00:04:52.850> when<00:04:52.940> I<00:04:52.970> play<00:04:53.270> is<00:04:53.450> the<00:04:53.660> the<00:04:53.900> most

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:54.080 
again even when I play is the the most

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:55.780 
again even when I play is the the most
unfair<00:04:54.470> character<00:04:54.980> of<00:04:55.040> the<00:04:55.100> game<00:04:55.280> finds<00:04:55.640> a<00:04:55.700> way

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:55.790 
unfair character of the game finds a way

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:59.740 
unfair character of the game finds a way
to<00:04:55.820> screw<00:04:56.180> me<00:04:56.330> over<00:04:57.550> this<00:04:58.550> level<00:04:58.970> uh<00:04:59.090> is

00:04:59.740 --> 00:04:59.750 
to screw me over this level uh is

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:01.030 
to screw me over this level uh is
another<00:05:00.020> one<00:05:00.200> that<00:05:00.230> basically<00:05:00.530> gives<00:05:00.920> you

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:01.040 
another one that basically gives you

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:05.410 
another one that basically gives you
glaucoma<00:05:01.520> or<00:05:02.920> if<00:05:03.920> you<00:05:04.100> did<00:05:04.340> not<00:05:04.460> have<00:05:04.670> any<00:05:05.120> kind

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:05.420 
glaucoma or if you did not have any kind

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:07.180 
glaucoma or if you did not have any kind
of<00:05:05.540> eye<00:05:05.660> trouble<00:05:05.930> or<00:05:06.290> eye<00:05:06.320> strain<00:05:06.740> before<00:05:06.920> you

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:07.190 
of eye trouble or eye strain before you

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:09.010 
of eye trouble or eye strain before you
started<00:05:07.550> you<00:05:07.700> definitely<00:05:08.360> will<00:05:08.510> after<00:05:08.690> so<00:05:08.990> I

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:09.020 
started you definitely will after so I

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:10.630 
started you definitely will after so I
usually<00:05:09.200> try<00:05:09.470> to<00:05:09.500> get<00:05:09.650> past<00:05:09.830> that<00:05:10.070> one<00:05:10.280> on<00:05:10.490> the

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:10.640 
usually try to get past that one on the

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:12.670 
usually try to get past that one on the
first<00:05:10.880> one<00:05:11.210> so<00:05:11.810> I<00:05:11.870> don't<00:05:11.960> cause<00:05:12.200> any<00:05:12.410> permanent

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:12.680 
first one so I don't cause any permanent

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:18.820 
first one so I don't cause any permanent
ocular<00:05:13.490> damage<00:05:15.400> this<00:05:16.400> one<00:05:16.700> is<00:05:16.970> actually<00:05:17.830> still

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:18.830 
ocular damage this one is actually still

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:20.740 
ocular damage this one is actually still
pretty<00:05:19.250> easy<00:05:19.400> I<00:05:19.550> mentioned<00:05:19.940> in<00:05:20.000> the<00:05:20.420> video<00:05:20.510> the

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:20.750 
pretty easy I mentioned in the video the

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:23.230 
pretty easy I mentioned in the video the
first<00:05:20.990> time<00:05:21.110> at<00:05:21.230> the<00:05:21.290> dark<00:05:21.590> world<00:05:21.890> it<00:05:22.130> is<00:05:22.640> quite

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:23.240 
first time at the dark world it is quite

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:26.340 
first time at the dark world it is quite
quite<00:05:23.540> quite<00:05:23.570> easy<00:05:24.230> even<00:05:25.190> compared<00:05:25.760> to<00:05:25.850> the

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:26.350 
quite quite easy even compared to the

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:28.870 
quite quite easy even compared to the
light<00:05:27.350> world<00:05:27.530> version<00:05:27.740> but<00:05:28.250> that<00:05:28.280> one<00:05:28.550> is<00:05:28.670> even

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:28.880 
light world version but that one is even
