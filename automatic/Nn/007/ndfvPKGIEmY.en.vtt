00:00:01.879 --> 00:00:04.400 

so<00:00:02.879> Brett<00:00:03.210> you're<00:00:03.449> involved<00:00:03.870> in<00:00:03.959> the<00:00:04.080> design

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:04.410 
so Brett you're involved in the design

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:10.669 
so Brett you're involved in the design
of<00:00:04.440> this<00:00:04.710> boat<00:00:05.089> like<00:00:06.140> vaguely<00:00:07.140> and<00:00:07.470> home<00:00:09.679> what

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
of this boat like vaguely and home what

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:16.420 
of this boat like vaguely and home what
do<00:00:10.740> you<00:00:10.830> think<00:00:11.070> the<00:00:11.190> strengths<00:00:11.700> of<00:00:11.820> the<00:00:11.969> boater

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:16.430 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:22.460 

in<00:00:19.730> all<00:00:20.730> conditions<00:00:21.170> that<00:00:22.170> we're<00:00:22.320> pretty

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
in all conditions that we're pretty

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.240 
in all conditions that we're pretty
confident<00:00:22.890> that<00:00:23.010> it<00:00:23.160> would<00:00:23.220> be<00:00:23.340> fast<00:00:23.640> downwind

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:25.250 
confident that it would be fast downwind

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:28.130 
confident that it would be fast downwind
we've<00:00:26.250> changed<00:00:26.849> a<00:00:27.119> little<00:00:27.359> bit<00:00:27.539> from<00:00:27.750> the

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
we've changed a little bit from the

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.630 
we've changed a little bit from the
traditional<00:00:28.619> method<00:00:28.800> of<00:00:29.130> trying<00:00:29.460> to<00:00:29.490> make

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
traditional method of trying to make

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:43.010 
traditional method of trying to make
this<00:00:29.789> downwind<00:00:30.240> from<00:00:30.449> the<00:00:30.630> hulls<00:00:41.690> we<00:00:42.690> will<00:00:42.840> see

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
this downwind from the hulls we will see

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.979 
this downwind from the hulls we will see
so<00:00:43.440> is<00:00:43.590> that<00:00:43.710> what<00:00:43.890> made<00:00:44.070> you<00:00:44.280> decide<00:00:44.460> to<00:00:44.989> put

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
so is that what made you decide to put

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.020 
so is that what made you decide to put
wind<00:00:46.170> rush<00:00:46.320> to<00:00:46.530> start<00:00:46.770> designing<00:00:46.950> f-18s<00:00:47.730> was

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
wind rush to start designing f-18s was

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.670 
wind rush to start designing f-18s was
because<00:00:48.360> you're<00:00:48.510> not<00:00:48.629> satisfied<00:00:48.930> with<00:00:49.500> the

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
because you're not satisfied with the

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.950 
because you're not satisfied with the
with<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.219> current<00:00:50.550> boats<00:00:50.760> or<00:00:51.120> not<00:00:51.600> so<00:00:51.780> much

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
with the current boats or not so much

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.080 
with the current boats or not so much
that<00:00:52.170> we<00:00:52.410> just<00:00:52.440> a<00:00:52.860> fade<00:00:53.280> in<00:00:53.309> in<00:00:53.579> Australia<00:00:54.030> is

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
that we just a fade in in Australia is

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.549 
that we just a fade in in Australia is
being<00:00:54.329> probably<00:00:54.690> a<00:00:54.899> little<00:00:55.050> bit<00:00:55.199> underdone

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
being probably a little bit underdone

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.470 
being probably a little bit underdone
for<00:00:55.890> a<00:00:55.920> long<00:00:56.070> time<00:00:56.280> and<00:00:56.550> I<00:00:56.940> think<00:00:57.149> everyone's

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
for a long time and I think everyone's

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.630 
for a long time and I think everyone's
now<00:00:57.629> seeing<00:00:57.899> that<00:00:58.109> how<00:00:58.949> big<00:00:59.129> it<00:00:59.250> is<00:00:59.340> in<00:00:59.520> Europe

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
now seeing that how big it is in Europe

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.569 
now seeing that how big it is in Europe
and<00:01:00.000> it's<00:01:00.329> starting<00:01:00.719> to<00:01:00.809> catch<00:01:00.989> on<00:01:01.199> and<00:01:01.579> we

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
and it's starting to catch on and we

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.030 
and it's starting to catch on and we
sort<00:01:03.210> of<00:01:03.270> decided<00:01:03.570> that<00:01:03.840> you<00:01:04.589> know<00:01:04.680> if<00:01:04.860> a

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
sort of decided that you know if a

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.969 
sort of decided that you know if a
thing's<00:01:05.220> probably<00:01:05.430> the<00:01:06.119> only<00:01:06.560> sailing<00:01:07.560> market

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
thing's probably the only sailing market

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.200 
thing's probably the only sailing market
at<00:01:08.100> the<00:01:08.159> moment<00:01:08.220> if<00:01:08.549> eighteen<00:01:08.909> and<00:01:09.030> after

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
at the moment if eighteen and after

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.719 
at the moment if eighteen and after
sixteen<00:01:09.600> two<00:01:10.100> things<00:01:11.100> that<00:01:11.220> you<00:01:11.310> can<00:01:11.430> probably

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
sixteen two things that you can probably

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.590 
sixteen two things that you can probably
economically<00:01:12.630> make<00:01:12.930> a<00:01:13.170> profit<00:01:13.680> from

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:14.600 
economically make a profit from

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.149 
economically make a profit from
realistically<00:01:15.600> if<00:01:16.470> we<00:01:16.650> wanted<00:01:16.860> to<00:01:16.920> keep

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
realistically if we wanted to keep

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:18.859 
realistically if we wanted to keep
making<00:01:17.549> on<00:01:17.790> catamarans<00:01:18.210> and<00:01:18.390> we<00:01:18.540> wanted<00:01:18.750> to

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
making on catamarans and we wanted to

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.960 
making on catamarans and we wanted to
develop<00:01:19.140> anything<00:01:19.560> new<00:01:19.710> it<00:01:20.430> would<00:01:20.549> have<00:01:20.670> to<00:01:20.820> be

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
develop anything new it would have to be

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.249 
develop anything new it would have to be
like<00:01:21.600> a<00:01:21.630> formula<00:01:23.090> you<00:01:24.090> think<00:01:24.330> from<00:01:24.990> the<00:01:25.110> rating

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
like a formula you think from the rating

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.380 
like a formula you think from the rating
is<00:01:25.979> starting<00:01:26.460> to<00:01:26.520> take<00:01:26.729> off<00:01:26.850> here<00:01:27.060> it<00:01:27.240> looks

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
is starting to take off here it looks

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.510 
is starting to take off here it looks
like<00:01:27.479> there's<00:01:27.750> going<00:01:27.840> to<00:01:27.900> be<00:01:27.960> 25<00:01:28.950> or<00:01:29.130> 30<00:01:29.340> boats

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
like there's going to be 25 or 30 boats

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:30.950 
like there's going to be 25 or 30 boats
or<00:01:29.759> the<00:01:29.820> national<00:01:30.119> championships<00:01:30.570> next<00:01:30.630> week

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
or the national championships next week

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.200 
or the national championships next week
where<00:01:31.890> we<00:01:32.070> will<00:01:32.100> go<00:01:32.369> and<00:01:32.490> sail<00:01:32.729> for<00:01:32.970> the<00:01:33.000> first

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
where we will go and sail for the first

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.890 
where we will go and sail for the first
time<00:01:33.420> with<00:01:33.570> these

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:35.900 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:37.749 

so<00:01:36.229> what<00:01:36.409> was<00:01:36.500> the<00:01:36.590> sort<00:01:36.770> of<00:01:36.799> process<00:01:37.250> that<00:01:37.520> was

00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:37.759 
so what was the sort of process that was

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:42.190 
so what was the sort of process that was
involved<00:01:38.299> in<00:01:38.450> in<00:01:38.750> in<00:01:39.170> the<00:01:39.350> whole<00:01:39.500> design<00:01:41.200> about

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.200 
involved in in in the whole design about

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.469 
involved in in in the whole design about
12<00:01:42.470> months<00:01:42.590> ago<00:01:42.770> we<00:01:43.070> sent<00:01:43.310> our<00:01:43.549> initial<00:01:44.000> design

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:44.479 
12 months ago we sent our initial design

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:50.289 
12 months ago we sent our initial design
ideas<00:01:44.960> to<00:01:45.229> Stuart<00:01:46.869> to<00:01:48.399> just<00:01:49.399> just<00:01:49.850> to<00:01:50.000> give<00:01:50.149> him

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:50.299 
ideas to Stuart to just just to give him

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:52.330 
ideas to Stuart to just just to give him
some<00:01:50.630> sketches<00:01:51.020> of<00:01:51.049> what<00:01:51.350> we<00:01:51.560> thought<00:01:52.190> as<00:01:52.310> a

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340 
some sketches of what we thought as a

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.210 
some sketches of what we thought as a
concept<00:01:52.789> and<00:01:53.060> said<00:01:53.750> to<00:01:53.869> him<00:01:53.990> you<00:01:54.020> know<00:01:54.170> do<00:01:55.100> you

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:55.220 
concept and said to him you know do you

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:57.730 
concept and said to him you know do you
have<00:01:55.310> a<00:01:55.369> look<00:01:55.520> at<00:01:55.610> this<00:01:55.759> and<00:01:56.090> you<00:01:56.780> know<00:01:56.990> add

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:57.740 
have a look at this and you know add

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.670 
have a look at this and you know add
subtract<00:01:58.430> change<00:01:59.030> whatever<00:01:59.600> you<00:01:59.960> know<00:02:00.140> and

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:00.680 
subtract change whatever you know and

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:02.649 
subtract change whatever you know and
then<00:02:01.220> send<00:02:01.490> us<00:02:01.549> back<00:02:01.700> something<00:02:01.970> and<00:02:02.210> sort<00:02:02.630> of

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:02.659 
then send us back something and sort of

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:05.469 
then send us back something and sort of
after<00:02:03.350> a<00:02:03.380> long<00:02:03.560> period<00:02:03.740> of<00:02:03.890> time<00:02:04.119> him<00:02:05.119> sort<00:02:05.420> of

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479 
after a long period of time him sort of

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:06.999 
after a long period of time him sort of
mulling<00:02:05.960> it<00:02:06.020> over<00:02:06.140> and<00:02:06.380> thinking<00:02:06.649> about<00:02:06.740> it<00:02:06.920> he

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:07.009 
mulling it over and thinking about it he

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:09.190 
mulling it over and thinking about it he
sent<00:02:07.250> back<00:02:07.399> at<00:02:07.580> drawing<00:02:07.789> and<00:02:08.300> then<00:02:08.780> from<00:02:09.019> there

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200 
sent back at drawing and then from there

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.590 
sent back at drawing and then from there
we<00:02:09.350> were<00:02:09.470> able<00:02:09.619> to<00:02:10.150> backwards<00:02:11.150> and<00:02:11.239> forwards

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:11.600 
we were able to backwards and forwards

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:15.070 
we were able to backwards and forwards
altered<00:02:12.290> the<00:02:12.380> design<00:02:12.560> probably<00:02:13.250> some<00:02:14.080> 2025

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
altered the design probably some 2025

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.640 
altered the design probably some 2025
times

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650

thank<00:02:15.890> you<00:02:16.010> just<00:02:16.190> refining<00:02:16.730> it<00:02:16.910> until<00:02:17.209> we<00:02:17.330> were

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
thank you just refining it until we were

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.930 
thank you just refining it until we were
happy<00:02:18.130> you<00:02:19.130> know<00:02:19.250> that<00:02:19.459> it<00:02:19.580> was<00:02:19.700> how<00:02:19.880> we

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
happy you know that it was how we

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:21.850 
happy you know that it was how we
thought<00:02:20.209> it<00:02:20.360> should<00:02:20.390> look<00:02:20.630> and<00:02:20.870> with<00:02:21.709> this

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
thought it should look and with this

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:23.229 
thought it should look and with this
velocity<00:02:22.100> prediction<00:02:22.670> program<00:02:23.000> we<00:02:23.150> were<00:02:23.209> able

00:02:23.229 --> 00:02:23.239 
velocity prediction program we were able

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:26.080 
velocity prediction program we were able
to<00:02:24.459> theoretically<00:02:25.459> simulate<00:02:25.910> the

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
to theoretically simulate the

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:28.059 
to theoretically simulate the
performance<00:02:26.540> of<00:02:26.630> the<00:02:26.690> right<00:02:26.900> and<00:02:27.769> we<00:02:27.920> just

00:02:28.059 --> 00:02:28.069 
performance of the right and we just

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:29.410 
performance of the right and we just
kept<00:02:28.250> wiggling<00:02:28.519> away<00:02:28.760> at<00:02:28.910> the<00:02:29.060> edges<00:02:29.299> a<00:02:29.330> bit

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
kept wiggling away at the edges a bit

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:34.420 
kept wiggling away at the edges a bit
until<00:02:29.810> we<00:02:32.080> and<00:02:33.080> with<00:02:33.410> the<00:02:33.590> trials<00:02:34.130> that<00:02:34.280> you've

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
until we and with the trials that you've

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:36.729 
until we and with the trials that you've
had<00:02:34.580> so<00:02:34.819> far<00:02:34.959> do<00:02:35.959> you<00:02:36.019> think<00:02:36.080> it<00:02:36.319> lives<00:02:36.440> up<00:02:36.709> to

00:02:36.729 --> 00:02:36.739 
had so far do you think it lives up to

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:41.259 
had so far do you think it lives up to
the<00:02:37.340> expectations<00:02:39.190> we<00:02:40.190> haven't<00:02:40.459> been<00:02:40.910> able<00:02:41.090> to

00:02:41.259 --> 00:02:41.269 
the expectations we haven't been able to

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:44.289 
the expectations we haven't been able to
really<00:02:41.959> match<00:02:42.260> up<00:02:43.040> against<00:02:43.820> other<00:02:44.060> boats

00:02:44.289 --> 00:02:44.299 
really match up against other boats

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:48.490 
really match up against other boats
other<00:02:44.840> air<00:02:45.049> feedings<00:02:46.810> really<00:02:47.810> advanced<00:02:48.290> to

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500 
other air feedings really advanced to

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.140 
other air feedings really advanced to
match<00:02:49.040> up<00:02:49.220> against<00:02:49.459> another<00:02:49.700> f-18<00:02:50.180> and

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
match up against another f-18 and

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.960 
match up against another f-18 and
he<00:02:51.989> was<00:02:52.140> a<00:02:52.170> it<00:02:52.650> was<00:02:52.799> a<00:02:52.830> good<00:02:53.580> one<00:02:53.760> that<00:02:53.790> was

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
he was a it was a good one that was

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:59.229 
he was a it was a good one that was
south<00:02:54.239> work<00:02:54.510> would<00:02:54.840> improve<00:02:55.470> and<00:02:55.890> we<00:02:56.760> were

00:02:59.229 --> 00:02:59.239 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:05.059 

okay<00:03:00.239> and<00:03:00.720> with<00:03:01.500> regards<00:03:02.010> to<00:03:03.319> to<00:03:04.319> you<00:03:04.890> know<00:03:04.920> to

00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:05.069 
okay and with regards to to you know to

okay and with regards to to you know to
to<00:03:05.640> difference<00:03:06.060> of<00:03:06.239> feel<00:03:06.599> in<00:03:06.959> terms<00:03:07.140> of<00:03:07.349> other

to difference of feel in terms of other
f-18s<00:03:08.430> that<00:03:08.730> you've<00:03:08.849> sailed<00:03:09.150> how<00:03:09.870> would<00:03:10.049> you

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
f-18s that you've sailed how would you

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:13.009 
f-18s that you've sailed how would you
describe<00:03:10.379> the<00:03:10.709> feel<00:03:10.920> of<00:03:10.950> it<00:03:11.280> and<00:03:11.900> downwind<00:03:12.900> it

00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:13.019 
describe the feel of it and downwind it

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:15.500 
describe the feel of it and downwind it
just<00:03:13.200> I've<00:03:13.650> only<00:03:14.069> started<00:03:14.310> once<00:03:14.670> and<00:03:14.970> a<00:03:15.329> couple

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
just I've only started once and a couple

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:23.599 
just I've only started once and a couple
of<00:03:15.629> days<00:03:15.780> ago<00:03:15.959> and<00:03:16.349> we<00:03:16.739> had<00:03:22.040> very<00:03:23.040> light<00:03:23.310> but

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:23.609 
of days ago and we had very light but

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:26.630 
of days ago and we had very light but
very<00:03:23.670> responsive<00:03:25.010> acceleration<00:03:26.010> you<00:03:26.489> could

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 
very responsive acceleration you could

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.220 
very responsive acceleration you could
really<00:03:26.849> feel<00:03:27.180> the<00:03:27.239> acceleration<00:03:27.989> to<00:03:28.200> I

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
really feel the acceleration to I

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:30.349 
really feel the acceleration to I
haven't<00:03:28.379> really<00:03:28.859> felt<00:03:29.099> before<00:03:29.700> and<00:03:30.060> other<00:03:30.180> it

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:30.359 
haven't really felt before and other it

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:33.589 
haven't really felt before and other it
making<00:03:31.760> that<00:03:32.760> something<00:03:33.060> you've<00:03:33.180> got<00:03:33.359> from

00:03:33.589 --> 00:03:33.599 
making that something you've got from

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:38.119 
making that something you've got from
your<00:03:33.780> tornado<00:03:34.170> sailing<00:03:34.799> oh<00:03:35.060> I<00:03:36.709> better<00:03:37.709> balance

00:03:38.119 --> 00:03:38.129 
your tornado sailing oh I better balance

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:40.160 
your tornado sailing oh I better balance
upwind<00:03:38.519> the<00:03:38.970> helm<00:03:39.150> was<00:03:39.299> just<00:03:39.540> beautiful<00:03:39.930> we're

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
upwind the helm was just beautiful we're

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:42.280 
upwind the helm was just beautiful we're
just<00:03:40.349> rest<00:03:40.650> in<00:03:40.799> your<00:03:40.920> hand<00:03:41.099> and<00:03:41.730> sail

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:42.290 
just rest in your hand and sail

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:44.569 
just rest in your hand and sail
fingertips<00:03:43.290> and<00:03:43.459> downwind

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:44.579 
fingertips and downwind

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:47.479 
fingertips and downwind
you<00:03:44.670> know<00:03:44.790> the<00:03:45.599> sail<00:03:46.260> area<00:03:46.290> and<00:03:46.739> things<00:03:46.890> of<00:03:47.010> all

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:47.489 
you know the sail area and things of all

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:49.580 
you know the sail area and things of all
things<00:03:47.670> going<00:03:47.940> on<00:03:48.030> us<00:03:48.180> it<00:03:49.170> had<00:03:49.319> a<00:03:49.349> little<00:03:49.470> bit

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590 
things going on us it had a little bit

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:52.150 
things going on us it had a little bit
