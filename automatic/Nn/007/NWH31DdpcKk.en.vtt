00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:44.100 
but I think a little touch will be just
fine<00:03:41.950> and<00:03:42.459> I'm<00:03:43.030> going<00:03:43.180> to<00:03:43.239> season<00:03:43.600> this<00:03:43.810> with

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:44.110 
fine and I'm going to season this with

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:45.420 
fine and I'm going to season this with
some<00:03:44.260> salt<00:03:44.320> I'm<00:03:44.830> not<00:03:44.950> going<00:03:45.070> to<00:03:45.130> add<00:03:45.220> any<00:03:45.400> more

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 
some salt I'm not going to add any more

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:47.640 
some salt I'm not going to add any more
pepper<00:03:45.790> right<00:03:46.450> over<00:03:46.630> the<00:03:46.720> added<00:03:47.020> pepper<00:03:47.140> and<00:03:47.590> I

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:47.650 
pepper right over the added pepper and I

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:48.870 
pepper right over the added pepper and I
season<00:03:47.920> this<00:03:48.070> with<00:03:48.250> a<00:03:48.280> little<00:03:48.489> bit<00:03:48.580> of<00:03:48.670> salt

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:48.880 
season this with a little bit of salt

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.240 
season this with a little bit of salt
because<00:03:49.060> it<00:03:49.330> is<00:03:49.450> quite<00:03:49.930> sweet<00:03:50.200> because<00:03:51.070> of<00:03:51.160> the

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:51.250 
because it is quite sweet because of the

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:52.979 
because it is quite sweet because of the
pumpkin<00:03:51.670> and<00:03:51.850> also<00:03:52.120> because<00:03:52.360> of<00:03:52.450> the<00:03:52.540> carrots

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:52.989 
pumpkin and also because of the carrots

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:56.190 
pumpkin and also because of the carrots
so<00:03:54.060> seasoning<00:03:55.060> it<00:03:55.180> well<00:03:55.360> definitely<00:03:56.019> going<00:03:56.140> to

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:56.200 
so seasoning it well definitely going to

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:57.479 
so seasoning it well definitely going to
make<00:03:56.290> a<00:03:56.320> big<00:03:56.500> difference<00:03:56.650> I'm<00:03:57.100> just<00:03:57.190> going<00:03:57.430> to
