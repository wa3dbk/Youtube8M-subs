hello today I'd like to talk to you
about<00:00:06.900> the<00:00:07.290> techniques<00:00:07.710> of<00:00:08.100> slide<00:00:08.760> cutting<00:00:09.300> or

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
about the techniques of slide cutting or

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.900 
about the techniques of slide cutting or
slither<00:00:09.960> cutting<00:00:10.440> these<00:00:11.340> are<00:00:11.519> techniques

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
slither cutting these are techniques

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.400 
slither cutting these are techniques
that<00:00:12.120> stylists<00:00:12.839> use<00:00:13.170> to<00:00:13.589> put<00:00:14.490> a<00:00:14.519> feathery<00:00:15.059> look

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:15.410 
that stylists use to put a feathery look

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:18.170 
that stylists use to put a feathery look
in<00:00:16.410> the<00:00:16.590> hair<00:00:16.830> especially<00:00:17.190> around<00:00:17.790> the<00:00:17.910> face

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
in the hair especially around the face

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.170 
in the hair especially around the face
and<00:00:18.510> to<00:00:18.990> provide<00:00:19.260> movement<00:00:20.010> or<00:00:20.250> action<00:00:20.550> in<00:00:20.970> the

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
and to provide movement or action in the

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.779 
and to provide movement or action in the
haircut<00:00:21.630> which<00:00:21.990> means<00:00:22.320> that<00:00:22.680> the<00:00:22.980> the<00:00:23.550> hair

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
haircut which means that the the hair

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.730 
haircut which means that the the hair
almost<00:00:24.000> looks<00:00:24.359> like<00:00:24.539> it's<00:00:24.720> in<00:00:24.869> movement<00:00:25.380> even

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
almost looks like it's in movement even

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.250 
almost looks like it's in movement even
though<00:00:25.980> the<00:00:26.279> head<00:00:26.460> is<00:00:26.640> standing<00:00:27.119> still<00:00:27.449> and<00:00:27.750> it

though the head is standing still and it

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:29.990 
though the head is standing still and it
means<00:00:28.470> that<00:00:28.740> usually<00:00:29.160> there's<00:00:29.340> not<00:00:29.609> a<00:00:29.640> lot<00:00:29.880> of

styling that has to be done to the hair
in<00:00:33.090> order<00:00:33.360> for<00:00:33.570> the<00:00:33.660> cut<00:00:33.900> to<00:00:34.200> look<00:00:34.410> beautiful

the the technique infrequently can use

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.369 
the the technique infrequently can use
any<00:00:41.640> good-quality<00:00:42.149> shear<00:00:42.780> that<00:00:42.960> she<00:00:43.170> has

any good-quality shear that she has
either<00:00:44.219> from<00:00:44.460> Japan<00:00:44.850> or<00:00:44.879> Korea

that's a nice of a made of a nice deal
good<00:00:48.780> sharp<00:00:49.079> edge<00:00:49.320> and<00:00:49.680> it<00:00:49.829> should<00:00:50.039> be<00:00:50.190> able<00:00:50.309> to

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
good sharp edge and it should be able to

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.090 
good sharp edge and it should be able to
accomplish<00:00:51.270> this<00:00:51.570> technique<00:00:52.020> for<00:00:52.230> her<00:00:52.350> but<00:00:53.010> if

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
accomplish this technique for her but if

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.099 
accomplish this technique for her but if
a<00:00:53.190> stylist<00:00:53.699> is<00:00:53.879> using<00:00:54.300> this<00:00:54.420> technique<00:00:54.870> on

00:00:55.099 --> 00:00:55.109 
a stylist is using this technique on

00:00:55.109 --> 00:00:57.470 
a stylist is using this technique on
most<00:00:55.440> of<00:00:55.649> her<00:00:55.800> cuts<00:00:56.070> then<00:00:56.579> she<00:00:56.879> might<00:00:57.090> want<00:00:57.390> to

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
most of her cuts then she might want to

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.590 
most of her cuts then she might want to
invest<00:00:57.989> in<00:00:58.320> a<00:00:58.590> tool<00:00:58.859> a<00:00:59.190> shear<00:00:59.879> that<00:01:00.420> was

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
invest in a tool a shear that was

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.840 
invest in a tool a shear that was
specifically<00:01:01.170> designed<00:01:01.410> to<00:01:01.949> do<00:01:02.309> slide

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
specifically designed to do slide

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.560 
specifically designed to do slide
cutting<00:01:03.559> the<00:01:04.559> typical<00:01:05.100> cutting<00:01:05.460> shear<00:01:05.760> has<00:01:06.510> a

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
cutting the typical cutting shear has a

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.170 
cutting the typical cutting shear has a
straight<00:01:07.140> blade<00:01:07.440> and<00:01:07.800> the<00:01:08.220> entire<00:01:08.550> blade<00:01:08.940> is

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
straight blade and the entire blade is

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.410 
straight blade and the entire blade is
designed<00:01:09.360> to<00:01:09.780> be<00:01:09.900> used<00:01:10.170> in<00:01:10.410> the<00:01:10.560> cut<00:01:11.120> for<00:01:12.120> a

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
designed to be used in the cut for a

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.050 
designed to be used in the cut for a
slide<00:01:13.200> cutting<00:01:13.590> shear<00:01:13.890> the<00:01:14.580> blade<00:01:14.790> looks

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
slide cutting shear the blade looks

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.480 
slide cutting shear the blade looks
quite<00:01:15.330> different<00:01:15.440> it's<00:01:16.440> usually<00:01:16.800> a<00:01:17.010> wider

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
quite different it's usually a wider

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.660 
quite different it's usually a wider
blade<00:01:17.820> which<00:01:18.660> means<00:01:18.990> that<00:01:19.380> the<00:01:19.860> edge<00:01:20.280> on<00:01:20.580> the

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
blade which means that the edge on the

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.880 
blade which means that the edge on the
blade<00:01:20.940> is<00:01:21.240> thinner<00:01:21.600> and<00:01:21.840> therefore<00:01:22.470> much

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
blade is thinner and therefore much

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.130 
blade is thinner and therefore much
sharper<00:01:23.660> also<00:01:24.660> the<00:01:25.260> blade<00:01:25.530> has<00:01:25.800> an<00:01:25.950> arc<00:01:26.220> unit

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:27.140 
sharper also the blade has an arc unit

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:31.910 
sharper also the blade has an arc unit
which<00:01:28.140> allows<00:01:28.560> the<00:01:29.010> hair<00:01:29.370> to<00:01:29.900> be<00:01:30.900> u<00:01:31.230> to<00:01:31.560> be<00:01:31.680> cut

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
which allows the hair to be u to be cut

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.460 
which allows the hair to be u to be cut
in<00:01:32.250> the<00:01:32.430> pivot<00:01:32.850> area<00:01:33.240> as<00:01:33.420> opposed<00:01:33.870> to<00:01:34.050> the<00:01:34.200> tip

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
in the pivot area as opposed to the tip

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.010 
in the pivot area as opposed to the tip
of<00:01:34.500> the<00:01:34.770> blade<00:01:35.030> they<00:01:36.030> actually<00:01:36.540> let<00:01:36.750> physics

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
of the blade they actually let physics

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.830 
of the blade they actually let physics
use<00:01:37.620> you<00:01:38.160> do<00:01:38.460> their<00:01:38.640> work<00:01:38.850> for<00:01:39.120> them<00:01:39.300> because

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
use you do their work for them because

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.500 
use you do their work for them because
the<00:01:40.470> these<00:01:40.860> the<00:01:41.400> hair<00:01:41.640> will<00:01:41.880> not<00:01:42.060> slide

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:42.510 
the these the hair will not slide

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:45.530 
the these the hair will not slide
against<00:01:43.140> the<00:01:43.890> length<00:01:44.640> of<00:01:44.790> the<00:01:44.880> blade<00:01:45.060> as<00:01:45.390> it

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
against the length of the blade as it

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.810 
against the length of the blade as it
will<00:01:45.690> in<00:01:45.840> a<00:01:45.930> straight<00:01:46.200> blade<00:01:46.470> but<00:01:47.070> actually<00:01:47.640> is

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
will in a straight blade but actually is

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.020 
will in a straight blade but actually is
stopped<00:01:48.540> by<00:01:48.870> forward<00:01:49.500> movement<00:01:49.890> by<00:01:50.220> that<00:01:50.580> by

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
stopped by forward movement by that by

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.200 
stopped by forward movement by that by
the<00:01:51.060> the<00:01:51.600> top<00:01:52.530> of<00:01:52.560> that<00:01:53.010> arc<00:01:53.340> on<00:01:53.580> the<00:01:53.700> blade<00:01:53.940> and

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
the the top of that arc on the blade and

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.930 
the the top of that arc on the blade and
therefore<00:01:55.170> as<00:01:55.350> she's<00:01:55.590> cutting<00:01:55.920> she<00:01:56.640> doesn't

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:56.940 
therefore as she's cutting she doesn't

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:00.440 
therefore as she's cutting she doesn't
have<00:01:57.090> to<00:01:57.270> worry<00:01:57.510> about<00:01:58.130> the<00:01:59.130> scissor<00:01:59.940> the<00:02:00.210> hair

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
have to worry about the scissor the hair

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.480 
have to worry about the scissor the hair
pushing<00:02:00.930> out<00:02:01.080> the<00:02:01.230> end<00:02:01.470> and<00:02:01.740> she<00:02:02.160> doesn't<00:02:02.340> have

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
pushing out the end and she doesn't have

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.400 
pushing out the end and she doesn't have
to<00:02:02.610> make<00:02:02.880> an<00:02:03.030> adjustment<00:02:03.150> in<00:02:03.720> her<00:02:03.900> curving

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:04.410 
to make an adjustment in her curving

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:07.490 
to make an adjustment in her curving
movement<00:02:04.860> in<00:02:05.010> order<00:02:05.520> to<00:02:05.640> do<00:02:05.820> that<00:02:06.200> when<00:02:07.200> she's

force the hair and also just forcing

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:26.759 
force the hair and also just forcing
that<00:03:25.299> hair<00:03:25.540> through<00:03:25.750> the<00:03:25.780> blade<00:03:26.049> can<00:03:26.320> often

cause discomfort to her clients and

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:31.920 
cause discomfort to her clients and
sometimes<00:03:30.519> they'll<00:03:30.790> let<00:03:31.269> the<00:03:31.390> stylist<00:03:31.780> know

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:31.930

hey<00:03:32.200> that<00:03:32.230> hurts<00:03:32.799> or<00:03:33.130> sometimes<00:03:34.090> they<00:03:34.390> just

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:34.750 
hey that hurts or sometimes they just

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:37.350 
hey that hurts or sometimes they just
won't<00:03:35.019> come<00:03:35.230> back<00:03:35.410> so<00:03:36.160> if<00:03:36.370> a<00:03:36.489> stylist<00:03:36.910> is<00:03:37.030> going

won't come back so if a stylist is going

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.620 
won't come back so if a stylist is going
to<00:03:37.540> use<00:03:37.900> slide<00:03:38.709> cutting<00:03:39.070> technique<00:03:39.519> for<00:03:40.299> many

wet head of hair good quality shears

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:58.750 
wet head of hair good quality shears
will<00:04:55.639> do<00:04:56.090> a<00:04:56.360> lot<00:04:57.020> of<00:04:57.080> dry<00:04:57.470> cutting<00:04:57.889> and<00:04:58.070> still

00:04:58.750 --> 00:04:58.760 
will do a lot of dry cutting and still

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:01.330 
will do a lot of dry cutting and still
maintain<00:04:59.300> their<00:04:59.539> edge<00:04:59.750> poor<00:05:00.530> quality<00:05:00.919> shears

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:01.340 
maintain their edge poor quality shears

maintain their edge poor quality shears
will<00:05:01.789> do<00:05:02.060> dry<00:05:02.360> cutting<00:05:02.780> but<00:05:03.169> as<00:05:03.530> as<00:05:04.340> time<00:05:04.669> goes

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:04.910 
will do dry cutting but as as time goes

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:06.460 
will do dry cutting but as as time goes
on<00:05:05.060> they<00:05:05.360> are<00:05:05.389> likely<00:05:05.810> to<00:05:05.930> lose<00:05:06.080> their<00:05:06.320> edge

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:06.470 
on they are likely to lose their edge

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:08.350 
on they are likely to lose their edge
more<00:05:06.710> quickly<00:05:07.010> because<00:05:07.250> dry<00:05:07.669> cutting<00:05:08.060> is

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:08.360 
more quickly because dry cutting is

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:10.719 
more quickly because dry cutting is
harder<00:05:08.870> on<00:05:09.050> the<00:05:09.260> edge<00:05:09.380> then<00:05:09.919> wet<00:05:10.190> cutting<00:05:10.580> is

00:05:10.719 --> 00:05:10.729 
harder on the edge then wet cutting is

00:05:10.729 --> 00:05:12.730 
harder on the edge then wet cutting is
it's<00:05:11.240> easier<00:05:11.630> to<00:05:11.750> wet<00:05:11.960> cut<00:05:12.229> with<00:05:12.409> this<00:05:12.470> year

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:12.740 
it's easier to wet cut with this year

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:15.550 
it's easier to wet cut with this year
than<00:05:13.159> it<00:05:13.310> is<00:05:13.430> to<00:05:13.580> dry<00:05:13.789> cut<00:05:14.030> with<00:05:14.180> a<00:05:14.210> shear<00:05:14.539> so<00:05:15.169> if

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:15.560 
than it is to dry cut with a shear so if

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:17.320 
than it is to dry cut with a shear so if
you<00:05:15.770> have<00:05:15.949> a<00:05:15.979> client<00:05:16.310> who's<00:05:16.610> doing<00:05:17.030> a<00:05:17.150> lot<00:05:17.300> of

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:17.330 
you have a client who's doing a lot of

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:19.960 
you have a client who's doing a lot of
dry<00:05:17.659> cutting<00:05:18.050> it's<00:05:18.590> a<00:05:18.770> good<00:05:19.130> idea<00:05:19.250> to<00:05:19.610> steer

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:19.970 
dry cutting it's a good idea to steer

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:21.820 
dry cutting it's a good idea to steer
her<00:05:20.240> to<00:05:20.570> a<00:05:20.599> shear<00:05:21.050> that's<00:05:21.320> a<00:05:21.440> little<00:05:21.620> higher

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:21.830 
her to a shear that's a little higher

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:23.920 
her to a shear that's a little higher
quality<00:05:22.400> she<00:05:23.120> may<00:05:23.300> have<00:05:23.479> to<00:05:23.599> pay<00:05:23.720> a<00:05:23.750> little

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:23.930 
quality she may have to pay a little

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:25.990 
quality she may have to pay a little
more<00:05:24.139> for<00:05:24.199> it<00:05:24.590> in<00:05:24.710> the<00:05:24.770> beginning<00:05:24.919> but<00:05:25.400> she's

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:26.000 
more for it in the beginning but she's

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.390 
more for it in the beginning but she's
going<00:05:26.240> to<00:05:26.419> save<00:05:26.659> cost<00:05:27.320> in<00:05:27.710> the<00:05:27.949> long<00:05:27.979> run

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:28.400 
going to save cost in the long run

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:29.950 
going to save cost in the long run
because<00:05:28.580> it's<00:05:28.880> not<00:05:29.000> going<00:05:29.210> to<00:05:29.330> be<00:05:29.419> needed<00:05:29.720> to

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:29.960 
because it's not going to be needed to

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:32.050 
because it's not going to be needed to
service<00:05:30.260> as<00:05:30.560> often<00:05:30.860> and<00:05:31.039> her<00:05:31.520> cuts<00:05:31.760> are<00:05:31.940> going

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:32.060 
service as often and her cuts are going

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:36.070 
service as often and her cuts are going
to<00:05:32.180> be<00:05:32.419> more<00:05:32.750> consistent<00:05:33.169> thank<00:05:33.919> you
