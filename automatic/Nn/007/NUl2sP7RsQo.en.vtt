so<00:04:40.600> I<00:04:40.630> have<00:04:40.930> an<00:04:41.050> inverter<00:04:41.380> that's<00:04:41.740> broken<00:04:42.070> so

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:42.460 
so I have an inverter that's broken so

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:45.960 
so I have an inverter that's broken so
unfortunately<00:04:43.030> I<00:04:43.120> can't<00:04:43.419> do<00:04:43.539> my<00:04:43.660> computer<00:04:44.970> it

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:45.970 
unfortunately I can't do my computer it

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:49.800 
unfortunately I can't do my computer it
died<00:04:46.150> the<00:04:46.360> other<00:04:46.449> day<00:04:46.740> my<00:04:47.740> inverter<00:04:48.810> so

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:49.810 
died the other day my inverter so

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:50.760 
died the other day my inverter so
whenever<00:04:50.050> I<00:04:50.139> have<00:04:50.260> the<00:04:50.350> money<00:04:50.530> hopefully

whenever I have the money hopefully

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:52.469 
whenever I have the money hopefully

it'll be sooner than rather than later
get<00:04:53.199> another<00:04:53.380> inverter<00:04:53.710> I<00:04:53.800> can<00:04:54.010> start<00:04:54.220> using

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:54.340 
get another inverter I can start using

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:55.680 
get another inverter I can start using
the<00:04:54.490> computer<00:04:54.820> out<00:04:54.940> here<00:04:55.120> as<00:04:55.180> long<00:04:55.300> as<00:04:55.449> I<00:04:55.510> want

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:40.180 
protein powder um yeah so legally here

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:41.820 
protein powder um yeah so legally here
you<00:05:40.419> can<00:05:40.539> stay<00:05:40.780> for<00:05:40.840> two<00:05:41.080> weeks<00:05:41.289> in<00:05:41.440> one<00:05:41.560> place

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:45.190 
go over there and the other side that

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:47.040 
go over there and the other side that
fire<00:05:45.400> pit<00:05:45.580> oh<00:05:45.789> yeah<00:05:46.330> look<00:05:46.539> at<00:05:46.630> this

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:47.050 
fire pit oh yeah look at this

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:51.240 
fire pit oh yeah look at this
I<00:05:47.080> mean<00:05:47.740> sand<00:05:49.139> sand<00:05:50.139> it's<00:05:50.470> like<00:05:50.590> a<00:05:50.620> sand<00:05:50.979> dunes

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:51.250 
I mean sand sand it's like a sand dunes

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:55.409 
I mean sand sand it's like a sand dunes
dude<00:05:53.280> and<00:05:54.280> then<00:05:54.550> I'll<00:05:54.699> be<00:05:54.820> and<00:05:55.000> I<00:05:55.060> could<00:05:55.270> just

00:05:55.409 --> 00:05:55.419 
dude and then I'll be and I could just
