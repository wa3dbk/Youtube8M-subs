volt color and we decided to do a
murdered<00:00:14.880> out<00:00:14.969> all<00:00:15.509> black<00:00:15.960> heat<00:00:16.470> in<00:00:16.619> it<00:00:16.710> and<00:00:17.359> it

murdered out all black heat in it and it

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.340 
murdered out all black heat in it and it
came<00:00:18.690> up<00:00:18.750> awesome<00:00:20.270> in<00:00:21.270> the<00:00:21.570> daylight<00:00:21.750> it's

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.109 
came up awesome in the daylight it's
really<00:00:22.560> awesome<00:00:22.769> because<00:00:23.039> the<00:00:23.250> black<00:00:23.460> really

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
really awesome because the black really

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:25.759 
really awesome because the black really
absorbs<00:00:24.539> the<00:00:24.689> Sun<00:00:24.960> so<00:00:25.230> you<00:00:25.289> really<00:00:25.529> see<00:00:25.650> the

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
absorbs the Sun so you really see the

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.830 
absorbs the Sun so you really see the
texture<00:00:26.099> of<00:00:26.220> it<00:00:26.369> and<00:00:26.519> then<00:00:26.609> the<00:00:27.210> outer<00:00:27.390> hat<00:00:27.689> is

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
texture of it and then the outer hat is

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.710 
texture of it and then the outer hat is
just<00:00:28.699> you<00:00:29.699> could<00:00:29.789> call<00:00:30.000> it<00:00:30.029> staring<00:00:30.449> at<00:00:30.570> and

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
just you could call it staring at and

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.139 
just you could call it staring at and
your<00:00:30.810> eyes<00:00:30.929> start<00:00:31.260> to<00:00:31.320> hurt<00:00:31.529> and<00:00:32.399> I'm<00:00:32.850> kind<00:00:33.090> of

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
outer instead of twists a little bit

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:22.999 
outer instead of twists a little bit
more<00:01:21.630> time<00:01:21.930> but<00:01:21.960> it's<00:01:22.409> gonna<00:01:22.500> make<00:01:22.680> this<00:01:22.830> stick

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
more time but it's gonna make this stick

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.859 
more time but it's gonna make this stick
that<00:01:23.189> much<00:01:23.369> more<00:01:23.610> unique<00:01:23.970> probably<00:01:24.720> do<00:01:24.780> it

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
that much more unique probably do it

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.469

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
that way here they go look at those

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:32.840 
that way here they go look at those

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.900 
but the ball literally does not move in
the<00:02:07.469> stick<00:02:07.740> when<00:02:07.860> you're<00:02:08.009> cradling<00:02:08.310> it<00:02:08.610> feels

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
the stick when you're cradling it feels

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.699 
the stick when you're cradling it feels
like<00:02:09.090> it's<00:02:09.539> part<00:02:09.899> of<00:02:10.020> the<00:02:10.110> stick<00:02:10.379> almost

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
like it's part of the stick almost

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.980 
like it's part of the stick almost
there's<00:02:11.280> really<00:02:11.700> no<00:02:12.090> rattle<00:02:12.629> but

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
there's really no rattle but

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:15.230 
there's really no rattle but
it's<00:02:13.260> gonna<00:02:13.350> be<00:02:13.500> hard<00:02:13.620> to<00:02:13.680> show<00:02:13.950> the<00:02:14.850> ball<00:02:15.060> just

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
it's gonna be hard to show the ball just

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.960 
it's gonna be hard to show the ball just
kind<00:02:15.450> of<00:02:15.510> sits<00:02:15.840> there<00:02:16.140> and<00:02:16.350> the<00:02:17.340> vertical<00:02:17.520> hold

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
kind of sits there and the vertical hold

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.960 
kind of sits there and the vertical hold
because<00:02:18.150> of<00:02:18.330> that<00:02:18.510> is<00:02:18.690> just<00:02:18.870> so<00:02:19.230> nice<00:02:19.530> I<00:02:19.950> mean<00:02:20.940> I

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
because of that is just so nice I mean I

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.590 
because of that is just so nice I mean I
said<00:02:21.390> my<00:02:21.540> ceiling<00:02:21.960> but<00:02:22.050> it's<00:02:22.260> it's<00:02:22.500> pretty

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:23.600 
said my ceiling but it's it's pretty

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.060 
said my ceiling but it's it's pretty
pretty<00:02:24.600> ridiculous<00:02:25.050> and<00:02:25.260> that<00:02:25.740> mean<00:02:25.890> the

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.070 
pretty ridiculous and that mean the

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:28.600 
pretty ridiculous and that mean the
pocket<00:02:26.610> is<00:02:26.730> a<00:02:26.760> lot<00:02:27.000> it's<00:02:27.480> not<00:02:27.630> as<00:02:27.810> high<00:02:27.990> as<00:02:28.050> my

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610 
pocket is a lot it's not as high as my

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:32.390 
pocket is a lot it's not as high as my
heat<00:02:29.610> is<00:02:30.320> giving<00:02:31.320> it<00:02:31.440> you<00:02:31.560> know<00:02:31.710> you<00:02:31.770> more<00:02:32.130> hold

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
heat is giving it you know you more hold

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.370 
heat is giving it you know you more hold
at<00:02:32.520> the<00:02:32.550> top<00:02:32.640> but<00:02:33.090> I<00:02:33.180> just<00:02:33.330> think<00:02:33.420> I'm<00:02:33.990> certain

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
at the top but I just think I'm certain

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.770 
at the top but I just think I'm certain
stirring<00:02:34.710> them<00:02:34.890> a<00:02:35.490> little<00:02:36.060> bit<00:02:36.240> tighter<00:02:36.450> and

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
stirring them a little bit tighter and

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.570 
stirring them a little bit tighter and
it's<00:02:37.260> just<00:02:37.470> giving<00:02:37.860> a<00:02:37.920> lot<00:02:38.070> of<00:02:38.190> hole<00:02:38.370> in<00:02:38.460> the

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
it's just giving a lot of hole in the

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:41.930 
it's just giving a lot of hole in the
ball<00:02:38.730> literally<00:02:39.060> just<00:02:39.240> sits<00:02:40.130> right<00:02:41.130> there<00:02:41.370> and

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
ball literally just sits right there and

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.500 
ball literally just sits right there and
it<00:02:42.120> just<00:02:42.300> holds<00:02:42.750> between<00:02:42.900> those<00:02:43.230> two<00:02:43.500> UH

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
it just holds between those two UH

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:48.580 
it just holds between those two UH
double<00:02:45.510> interlocks<00:02:45.900> because<00:02:46.830> it's<00:02:47.010> just<00:02:47.100> so

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
double interlocks because it's just so

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:57.950 
double interlocks because it's just so
smooth<00:02:54.500> feels<00:02:55.500> so<00:02:55.710> nice<00:02:55.890> and<00:02:56.540> this<00:02:57.540> has<00:02:57.750> also

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:57.960 
smooth feels so nice and this has also

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:01.820 
smooth feels so nice and this has also
pretty<00:02:58.230> stiff<00:02:58.590> so<00:02:59.490> really<00:02:59.730> when<00:02:59.940> you<00:03:00.620> crank<00:03:01.620> on

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
pretty stiff so really when you crank on

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:03.800 
pretty stiff so really when you crank on
it<00:03:01.860> the<00:03:02.850> head<00:03:03.000> really<00:03:03.150> doesn't<00:03:03.450> move<00:03:03.570> at<00:03:03.720> all

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810
