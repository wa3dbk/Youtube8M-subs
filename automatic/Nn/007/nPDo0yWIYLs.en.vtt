00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:03.529
 the first responsibility of the hospitality entrepreneurs are for drunk 

00:00:03.529 --> 00:00:08.210
 customers the parents of the 17-year-old avira who arrived two weeks ago on the ijssel 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.999
 came up 

00:00:08.999 --> 00:00:12.759
 that was hit by a drunk driver not to rest before 

00:00:12.759 --> 00:00:15.169
 they have spread their message 

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:19.429
 if it is up to them, nobody is allowed to get behind the wheel drunk 

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:23.429
 they are supported in this by the Netherlands Alcohol Prevention Foundation 

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:27.019
 who argued for making drink providers liable as a drunk 

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:30.019
 caused a serious traffic accident 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:42.370
 anger and sadness alternate my parents from the age of 4 or fifteen 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:43.270
 recruit 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:46.330
 that his daughter has been killed by a drunk driver 

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:49.440
 of the sales I have been responding to 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.650
 and I said go do it 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:55.580
 girl I go for it I am going to tell the whole of the Netherlands 

00:00:55.580 --> 00:01:00.630
 and being drunk behind the wheel really can't see the consequences 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:03.120
 we are lost as a girl 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.710
 And yet there are already had the board here so do it and then it will be 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.170
 whole book 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:12.570
 a little piece of adrenaline and with that the lead I became 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.680
 Sunday evening is now two weeks ago bicycle is fourth on the bike path of 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.909
 This rule dessel when a drunk driver took control 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:21.920
 lost and scooped there 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.610
 The 20-year-old man had himself ski the permitted amount of alcohol in his 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:27.700
 blood when the police picked him up 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.200
 according to the Dutch Alcohol Prevention Foundation for such an accident 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.160
 should be looked at or to provide the drink also negligence 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:36.120
 blame 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:39.909
 if you can occur as a citizen that otherwise must commit a serious crime 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:43.930
 then it is obvious that co-responsibility also counts 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:47.400
 and therefore the ones who pour the drink are one 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:51.039
 is a catering entrepreneur or a family member at a party at home 

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:54.890
 you must check whether the person getting drunk does not get behind the wheel 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:58.030
 when they see that someone is drinking too much and has done something about their behavior 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:59.290
 address 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:03.830
 and say much nicer it really can not drive the car and let you pick out 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:07.580
 and bring home leave the car and then go up the next day 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:12.620
 that is my message because you never know what you want on the way to the city 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:16.359
 go so far as to investigate the prosecution or the provider 

00:02:16.359 --> 00:02:19.730
 of alcohol after a serious accident can be prosecuted to all that chance 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:20.729
 example 

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:24.259
 when and where did someone have the last alcohol consumption? 

00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:27.169
 well that happened how much has been gained 

00:02:27.169 --> 00:02:31.369
 the city has been visible and the club stalker westervoort entrepreneur knew that 

00:02:31.369 --> 00:02:34.689
 there is someone with the inconvenience and it appears in the traffic jam is very often that 

00:02:34.689 --> 00:02:37.969
 convictions to include the conviction not only of the offender but in this 

00:02:37.969 --> 00:02:41.519
 case also of the amplifier I think it is quite far and go 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:45.510
 sent to him he has taken his own responsibility earlier 

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:48.509
 stepped in a much bigger way than the plan goes there 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:51.989
 however, none goes for parents from the age of 4 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:55.129
 measure to avoid springs on drunk driving 

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:59.219
 when I then read on the internet again about going on television 

00:02:59.219 --> 00:03:02.219
 and we are again caught under the influence than I think 

00:03:03.339 --> 00:03:07.749
 How Far Should This Consider Whether Parents Coarse Money Families still need to be developed 

00:03:07.749 --> 00:03:10.069
 by a so-called mills
