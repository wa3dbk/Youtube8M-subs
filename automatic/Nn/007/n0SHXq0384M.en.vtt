00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.210 
I think it was was the last video that I
did<00:01:51.240> and<00:01:51.390> someone<00:01:52.229> can<00:01:52.439> you<00:01:52.560> check<00:01:52.740> the<00:01:52.920> end<00:01:53.070> of

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
did and someone can you check the end of

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.670 
did and someone can you check the end of
that<00:01:53.310> I<00:01:53.549> think<00:01:53.759> it<00:01:53.880> was<00:01:53.970> 240<00:01:54.780> something<00:01:55.170> or

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
that I think it was 240 something or

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.039 
that I think it was 240 something or
maybe<00:01:55.799> 250<00:01:56.369> something<00:01:56.579> if<00:01:57.540> someone<00:01:57.810> can<00:01:57.930> go

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
maybe 250 something if someone can go

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.649 
maybe 250 something if someone can go
and<00:01:58.170> check<00:01:58.290> the<00:01:58.469> top<00:01:58.649> speed<00:01:59.240> that<00:02:00.240> I<00:02:00.270> was<00:02:00.450> able

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
and check the top speed that I was able

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:03.050 
and check the top speed that I was able
to<00:02:00.689> hit<00:02:00.990> so<00:02:01.439> we<00:02:01.530> can<00:02:01.680> potentially<00:02:02.219> break<00:02:02.700> it<00:02:02.909> I

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
to hit so we can potentially break it I

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.499 
to hit so we can potentially break it I
do<00:02:03.450> have<00:02:03.689> an<00:02:03.780> open<00:02:03.869> Lobby<00:02:04.110> happening<00:02:05.149> not<00:02:06.149> this

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
actual tune on this thing but we need to

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.510

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:53.520 
adjust it a lot we need more grip

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.430 
adjust it a lot we need more grip
off-road<00:02:53.970> so<00:02:54.540> to<00:02:54.599> get<00:02:54.720> more<00:02:54.840> grip<00:02:55.020> offered<00:02:55.319> we

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
off-road so to get more grip offered we

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:56.680 
off-road so to get more grip offered we
need<00:02:55.560> to<00:02:55.650> lower<00:02:55.890> our<00:02:56.010> tire<00:02:56.220> pressure<00:02:56.459> down

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:56.690 
need to lower our tire pressure down

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:59.089 
need to lower our tire pressure down
soften<00:02:57.690> up<00:02:57.989> all<00:02:58.170> our<00:02:58.290> anti-roll<00:02:58.680> bars<00:02:58.860> so<00:02:58.980> it

00:02:59.089 --> 00:02:59.099 
soften up all our anti-roll bars so it

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:00.470 
soften up all our anti-roll bars so it
absorbs<00:02:59.580> a<00:02:59.670> lot<00:02:59.700> of<00:02:59.819> the<00:02:59.910> bumps<00:03:00.150> instead<00:03:00.390> of

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
absorbs a lot of the bumps instead of

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.900 
absorbs a lot of the bumps instead of
doing<00:03:01.319> the<00:03:01.410> 12<00:03:01.709> flips<00:03:02.069> it<00:03:02.220> just<00:03:02.459> did

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910

okay<00:03:14.390> okay<00:03:15.390> okay<00:03:16.380> let's<00:03:16.500> try<00:03:16.709> keep<00:03:16.950> going<00:03:18.080> this

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:19.080 
okay okay okay let's try keep going this

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:22.039 
okay okay okay let's try keep going this
part<00:03:19.290> gets<00:03:19.470> way<00:03:19.830> too<00:03:19.860> bumpy<00:03:20.430> stop<00:03:21.180> bouncy<00:03:21.870> like

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:22.049 
part gets way too bumpy stop bouncy like

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:27.559 
part gets way too bumpy stop bouncy like
mmm<00:03:23.299> stop<00:03:24.299> it<00:03:24.630> stay<00:03:25.290> on<00:03:25.319> the<00:03:25.799> ground<00:03:26.130> if<00:03:26.730> I

00:03:27.559 --> 00:03:27.569 
mmm stop it stay on the ground if I

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:28.729 
mmm stop it stay on the ground if I
press<00:03:27.840> the<00:03:27.870> right<00:03:28.170> button<00:03:28.470> instead<00:03:28.650> of

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
press the right button instead of

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:32.180 
press the right button instead of
shifting<00:03:29.130> down<00:03:29.280> 12<00:03:29.700> times<00:03:30.170> they<00:03:31.170> split<00:03:31.530> should

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
shifting down 12 times they split should

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.309 
shifting down 12 times they split should
I<00:03:32.250> put<00:03:32.459> rally<00:03:32.670> Springs<00:03:33.030> actually<00:03:33.269> that<00:03:34.170> is<00:03:34.290> a

00:03:34.309 --> 00:03:34.319 
I put rally Springs actually that is a

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:37.100 
I put rally Springs actually that is a
good<00:03:34.620> idea<00:03:34.769> so<00:03:35.370> we<00:03:35.459> hit<00:03:35.580> 237<00:03:36.269> before<00:03:36.720> we<00:03:36.959> should

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:37.110 
good idea so we hit 237 before we should

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:38.809 
good idea so we hit 237 before we should
be<00:03:37.230> faster<00:03:37.739> with<00:03:37.890> this<00:03:38.040> essentially

00:03:38.809 --> 00:03:38.819 
be faster with this essentially

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:41.089 
be faster with this essentially
hopefully<00:03:39.630> but<00:03:40.230> I'm<00:03:40.319> not<00:03:40.440> sure<00:03:40.650> those<00:03:40.830> rally

00:03:41.089 --> 00:03:41.099 
hopefully but I'm not sure those rally

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:44.199 
hopefully but I'm not sure those rally
