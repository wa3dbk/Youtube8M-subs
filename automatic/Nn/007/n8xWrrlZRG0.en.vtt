00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:09.760
 and good today we have a computer equipment 

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:13.719
 very interesting from the signature hewlett 

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:16.090
 packard and it's about the chromebook 14 

00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:18.130
 what is this good this computer that 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:19.810
 it looks like all the laptops there 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:21.580
 out there to any other laptop that by 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:25.090
 there but it has a good characteristic 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:28.150
 interesting does not work with windows this 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:31.210
 team is the chromebook works with the 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:34.570
 operational chrome or is it google that is 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:36.969
 that very easy google besides being the 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:38.800
 search engine and all the tools that 

00:00:36.969 --> 00:00:41.200
 we use every day the development 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:43.720
 chrome browser a few years ago and 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:45.820
 from there he came up with the idea of 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:48.150
 that all your computational anxieties of 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:50.590
 technology or internet access 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:52.300
 could be resolved through a 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:55.090
 only program in this case is the 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:57.790
 browser from there they did what 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:01:00.370
 they developed all software that can 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:02.860
 operate a computer without need 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:05.379
 of any other operation or anything 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:06.790
 only chrome or is what 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:09.250
 they have these equipment is called 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:11.500
 generically chrome in this case this 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:12.730
 is the chromebook 14 because the screens 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.950
 of 14 inches 

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:16.750
 as I mentioned natural it seems a 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:19.120
 laptop is a laptop is what I 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:22.480
 I mean it looks like a computer with windows or 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:25.420
 something like that but not when you open it 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:27.400
 keyboard layout is very similar to 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:29.410
 with my computer that you know the 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:32.530
 screen is also very similar and what 

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:34.660
 change is that it lights instantly 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.670
 they do not charge a small charge 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:39.040
 program that you have there recorded in a 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:41.320
 solid state drive is to say there's no 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:44.110
 no moving part in this equipment and what 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:46.180
 what you have on the screen is good about 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:48.400
 how many icons so you can use it 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:51.370
 as a guest is to say if you lend to 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:53.380
 someone or something or of course the 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:55.570
 you set up with your account of any 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:57.610
 gmail service and and what your you 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:00.130
 access to all the information you have 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:01.840
 stored in the services of this 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:03.670
 google company i know i can 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.770
 enter for example to a very site 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:08.080
 known to all of you 10 point com 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:11.500
 and what I have experience looks like 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:14.380
 more or less to use the browser 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:16.390
 chrome on your computer is a browser 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.880
 chrome nothing more than this one has some 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:20.560
 additional features why 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:22.390
 include some other functions that 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:26.260
 they have to do with the computer as 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:28.960
 is the wifi connection the layout of the 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:30.790
 keyboard etcetera and there's also a 

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:33.250
 Pretty file manager 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:35.200
 simple where these teams have a 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:36.910
 memory space to store 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.550
 information and also of course it 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:42.010
 connect all the time to google drive 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:44.410
 through the internet and it's a very 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:46.540
 important this equipment is designed to 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:49.150
 be used with an internet connection and or 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:50.290
 I think that 90% of the time in 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:52.960
 some occasions that we do not have 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:54.640
 Internet connection is possible to tell 

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:57.100
 google or google services that do not 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:59.620
 I have a connection and I want to use the 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:01.690
 offline services this applies 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:03.670
 to bring documents to read emails 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:05.470
 and answering them does not stop 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:07.420
 send them and other functions out there 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:09.610
 all the applications that are in the 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:12.070
 chrome web store applications for 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:13.900
 chrome some serves no longer serve us 

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:15.640
 depending on what the application does 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:18.300
 so much has to do with the computer or 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:20.860
 with parts of other operating systems 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:23.200
 but in general it is a team with some 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:24.550
 interesting features as already 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:27.730
 we mention screen 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:33.520
 14 inch technology LEDs in 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:35.890
 resolution 1366 x 768 pixels is a 

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:38.110
 intel processor celeron 2 cores 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:40.840
 the graphics are also integrated 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:44.590
 intel of 2 gigas in ram and storage 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:47.440
 internal 16 gigas and when you buy this 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:49.960
 google gives you 100 gigs for 2 years 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:51.280
 so you can save what you can think of and 

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:52.750
 when the two years are over by 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:55.510
 course they do not lose the information 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:56.920
 google tells you hey you're going to end up if 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:59.740
 you want to continue good because they pay the 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:02.110
 quota that corresponds to these 100 gigas 

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:04.840
 the battery lasts longer or 

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:06.760
 less than up to 9 hours of active use on 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:09.250
 keyboard is illuminated that is if not 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:10.560
 there is a lot of natural light illuminates the 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:13.300
 keyboard so you can keep working 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:15.130
 let's see what it has of ports of a 

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:17.709
 side has a hdmi port so that 

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:20.620
 Take out video for presentations or what 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:24.370
 that you need to make two usb ports and 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:25.870
 The hearing aid and microphone port is the 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:27.400
 security port you can put me a 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:29.440
 padlock so they do not take it to 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:31.860
 no part the computer and in the 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:35.969
 another side we have another port 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:38.340
 a sd card reader and the connector 

00:04:35.969 --> 00:04:39.780
 to charge the battery through the 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:42.479
 eliminator that is included by 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:45.449
 course in this that is the chromebook of 

00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:47.610
 14 inches the approximate price of 5 

00:04:45.449 --> 00:04:49.889
 thousand pesos to see where you buy it 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:51.599
 but it is the suggested price and the truth 

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:54.689
 is that using this equipment is a treat 

00:04:51.599 --> 00:04:56.789
 You are combox in general because I close 

00:04:54.689 --> 00:04:58.560
 the machine in a couple of seconds it 

00:04:56.789 --> 00:05:01.080
 shutdown is ready to be transported 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:03.689
 to take the iss to where you arrive 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:06.449
 you open it 

00:05:03.689 --> 00:05:07.889
 and it's ready to work a good 

00:05:06.449 --> 00:05:10.069
 Internet connection is going to make us more 

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:12.089
 fast when there is an update 

00:05:10.069 --> 00:05:14.879
 automatically warns me or I'm going to 

00:05:12.089 --> 00:05:16.829
 update true if it takes 20 seconds and 

00:05:14.879 --> 00:05:18.719
 updates and the machine is so simple to 

00:05:16.829 --> 00:05:21.539
 use that comes with those instructions from 

00:05:18.719 --> 00:05:24.839
 configuration where you can realize 

00:05:21.539 --> 00:05:27.749
 that basically is to connect to the 

00:05:24.839 --> 00:05:29.219
 current and turn on the es is everything 

00:05:27.749 --> 00:05:30.929
 what to do here of course 

00:05:29.219 --> 00:05:33.029
 explain in a little more detail what 

00:05:30.929 --> 00:05:35.759
 that has where the antennas are for 

00:05:33.029 --> 00:05:37.439
 connect wifi have the speakers for 

00:05:35.759 --> 00:05:39.629
 listen to everything you need 

00:05:37.439 --> 00:05:41.489
 internet the mouse includes some gestures 

00:05:39.629 --> 00:05:44.999
 so you can move around the 

00:05:41.489 --> 00:05:46.889
 screen and so on and it's basically the 

00:05:44.999 --> 00:05:49.079
 information that this equipment includes 

00:05:46.889 --> 00:05:50.909
 I insist it is very very easy to use 

00:05:49.079 --> 00:05:52.559
 it's not a computer that replaces 

00:05:50.909 --> 00:05:55.349
 a traditional computer the wave 'with 

00:05:52.559 --> 00:05:58.709
 windows or a mac does not replace it but 

00:05:55.349 --> 00:06:01.169
 yes you can meet 90 percent of 

00:05:58.709 --> 00:06:03.209
 the needs of many people who do 

00:06:01.169 --> 00:06:05.879
 all online through a browser 

00:06:03.209 --> 00:06:07.379
 in this case through chrome they can 

00:06:05.879 --> 00:06:09.689
 see your mail can enter networks 

00:06:07.379 --> 00:06:11.759
 can enter the bank create 

00:06:09.689 --> 00:06:13.679
 documents everything that is done 

00:06:11.759 --> 00:06:16.409
 normally with a computer of these 

00:06:13.679 --> 00:06:18.809
 features is the chromebook 14 of 

00:06:16.409 --> 00:06:23.089
 hewlett packard and you're seeing it here 

00:06:18.809 --> 00:06:23.089
 of course in 10 point com
