itself<00:02:21.380> really<00:02:22.380> nice-looking<00:02:22.560> sculpt<00:02:23.340> detail

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
itself really nice-looking sculpt detail

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.330 
itself really nice-looking sculpt detail
for<00:02:24.300> me<00:02:24.330> this<00:02:24.600> is<00:02:24.810> what<00:02:25.380> Batman<00:02:25.620> should<00:02:26.100> look

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
for me this is what Batman should look

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.160 
for me this is what Batman should look
like<00:02:26.580> he's<00:02:27.060> got<00:02:27.240> the<00:02:27.390> pointy<00:02:27.690> ears<00:02:27.870> the

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
like he's got the pointy ears the

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.530 
like he's got the pointy ears the
pissed-off<00:02:28.380> face<00:02:28.830> he's<00:02:29.730> muscular<00:02:30.000> but<00:02:30.450> he's

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
pissed-off face he's muscular but he's

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:31.910 
pissed-off face he's muscular but he's
still<00:02:30.720> thinning<00:02:31.140> doesn't<00:02:31.380> look<00:02:31.530> like<00:02:31.680> he

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
still thinning doesn't look like he

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.490 
still thinning doesn't look like he
doesn't<00:02:32.160> look<00:02:32.250> fat<00:02:32.520> I<00:02:33.080> relax<00:02:34.080> this<00:02:34.170> Batman

doesn't look fat I relax this Batman
figure<00:02:34.650> I<00:02:34.770> think<00:02:34.950> is<00:02:35.040> probably<00:02:35.130> the

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
figure I think is probably the

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.430 
figure I think is probably the
best-looking<00:02:35.850> Batman<00:02:36.360> out<00:02:36.480> there<00:02:36.690> it's<00:02:37.350> not

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
best-looking Batman out there it's not

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.700 
best-looking Batman out there it's not
the<00:02:37.830> best<00:02:38.040> but<00:02:38.310> it<00:02:38.430> is<00:02:38.520> the<00:02:38.700> best-looking<00:02:39.060> one

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:39.710 
the best but it is the best-looking one

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:41.860 
the best but it is the best-looking one
as<00:02:40.710> for<00:02:40.950> articulation

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870

probably<00:03:29.760> give<00:03:29.970> him<00:03:30.090> a<00:03:30.150> 7<00:03:30.540> but<00:03:31.140> for<00:03:31.350> Batman

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:33.050 
probably give him a 7 but for Batman
fans<00:03:31.860> I<00:03:32.010> would<00:03:32.190> definitely<00:03:32.550> say<00:03:32.640> pick<00:03:32.850> him<00:03:32.970> up

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459 
and all these individual pouches nicely

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:47.750 
and all these individual pouches nicely
painted<00:03:44.640> all<00:03:44.940> the<00:03:45.300> way<00:03:45.390> around<00:03:45.690> the<00:03:45.810> belt<00:03:46.760> and

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
painted all the way around the belt and

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.820 
painted all the way around the belt and
then<00:03:48.630> if<00:03:48.780> even<00:03:49.020> if<00:03:49.110> you<00:03:49.170> look<00:03:49.320> at<00:03:49.410> his<00:03:49.530> feet

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:49.830 
then if even if you look at his feet

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:51.410 
then if even if you look at his feet
he's<00:03:50.070> got<00:03:50.280> boots<00:03:50.550> he's<00:03:50.790> got<00:03:50.940> tread<00:03:51.209> on<00:03:51.330> the

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:51.420 
he's got boots he's got tread on the

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:54.260 
he's got boots he's got tread on the
side<00:03:51.630> if<00:03:52.230> you<00:03:52.530> open<00:03:52.860> up<00:03:52.950> to<00:03:53.010> the<00:03:53.190> bottom<00:03:53.610> he's

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:54.270 
side if you open up to the bottom he's

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:55.760 
side if you open up to the bottom he's
got<00:03:54.450> tread<00:03:54.780> and<00:03:54.900> a<00:03:54.959> little<00:03:55.170> bat<00:03:55.380> sitting<00:03:55.680> on

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:55.770 
got tread and a little bat sitting on

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:56.780 
got tread and a little bat sitting on
the<00:03:55.860> middle<00:03:55.950> so<00:03:56.190> you<00:03:56.280> know<00:03:56.400> it's<00:03:56.550> him<00:03:56.700> when

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:56.790 
the middle so you know it's him when

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:58.490 
the middle so you know it's him when
he's<00:03:56.880> kicking<00:03:57.180> your<00:03:57.300> ass<00:03:57.450> I<00:03:57.810> think<00:03:58.350> that's

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
he's kicking your ass I think that's

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:59.900 
he's kicking your ass I think that's
really<00:03:58.620> cool<00:03:58.890> I<00:03:59.130> don't<00:03:59.400> think<00:03:59.550> this<00:03:59.640> figure

00:03:59.900 --> 00:03:59.910 
really cool I don't think this figure

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:01.910 
really cool I don't think this figure
would<00:04:00.060> have<00:04:00.239> that<00:04:00.390> much<00:04:00.480> detail<00:04:00.900> in<00:04:01.110> but<00:04:01.830> it

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920 
would have that much detail in but it

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:03.920 
would have that much detail in but it
does<00:04:02.070> so<00:04:02.790> because<00:04:02.940> of<00:04:03.180> that<00:04:03.209> I<00:04:03.330> would<00:04:03.630> say<00:04:03.780> he's

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930 
does so because of that I would say he's

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:05.630 
does so because of that I would say he's
worth<00:04:04.080> picking<00:04:04.260> up<00:04:04.500> you<00:04:04.920> despite<00:04:05.310> the<00:04:05.340> lack<00:04:05.610> of

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:05.640 
worth picking up you despite the lack of

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:08.390 
worth picking up you despite the lack of
articulation<00:04:06.590> another<00:04:07.590> flaw<00:04:07.890> people<00:04:08.250> have

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
articulation another flaw people have

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.120 
articulation another flaw people have
with<00:04:08.550> this<00:04:08.670> figure<00:04:08.970> is<00:04:09.209> the<00:04:09.840> hands<00:04:10.260> he's

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:11.130 
with this figure is the hands he's

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:12.820 
with this figure is the hands he's
holding<00:04:11.459> one<00:04:11.489> and<00:04:11.940> the<00:04:12.000> other<00:04:12.120> one<00:04:12.239> has<00:04:12.360> like

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:12.830 
holding one and the other one has like

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:15.320 
holding one and the other one has like
open<00:04:13.830> hand<00:04:14.040> which<00:04:14.400> is<00:04:14.430> like<00:04:14.820> a<00:04:14.850> nice<00:04:15.060> soft

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:15.330 
open hand which is like a nice soft

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:17.900 
open hand which is like a nice soft
plastic<00:04:15.840> key<00:04:15.959> bendable<00:04:16.650> but<00:04:17.609> he<00:04:17.700> kind<00:04:17.880> of

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:17.910 
plastic key bendable but he kind of

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:19.599 
plastic key bendable but he kind of
limits<00:04:18.239> the<00:04:18.390> poses<00:04:18.840> you<00:04:18.870> can<00:04:19.109> do<00:04:19.200> with<00:04:19.350> him

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:19.609 
limits the poses you can do with him

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:21.800 
limits the poses you can do with him
the<00:04:20.609> only<00:04:20.760> real<00:04:20.940> pose<00:04:21.150> I<00:04:21.180> think<00:04:21.479> you<00:04:21.539> can<00:04:21.660> do

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810 
the only real pose I think you can do

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:23.000 
the only real pose I think you can do
with<00:04:21.930> them<00:04:22.109> is<00:04:22.289> where<00:04:22.440> he's<00:04:22.530> about<00:04:22.620> to<00:04:22.830> throw

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:23.010 
with them is where he's about to throw

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:24.860 
with them is where he's about to throw
us<00:04:23.130> Batarang<00:04:23.580> which<00:04:24.360> is<00:04:24.510> still<00:04:24.660> a<00:04:24.690> nice

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:24.870 
us Batarang which is still a nice

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:26.420 
us Batarang which is still a nice
looking<00:04:25.080> pose<00:04:25.380> I<00:04:25.680> mean<00:04:25.890> I<00:04:26.039> really<00:04:26.250> like

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430 
looking pose I mean I really like

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:29.480 
looking pose I mean I really like
this<00:04:26.550> boy<00:04:26.729> he<00:04:26.880> looks<00:04:27.060> like<00:04:27.210> that<00:04:28.190> another<00:04:29.190> flaw

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:29.490 
this boy he looks like that another flaw

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:30.920 
this boy he looks like that another flaw
with<00:04:29.669> him<00:04:29.850> is<00:04:30.060> when<00:04:30.360> you<00:04:30.449> send<00:04:30.690> him<00:04:30.780> up

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:30.930 
with him is when you send him up

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:33.590 
with him is when you send him up
straight<00:04:31.639> he's<00:04:32.639> constantly<00:04:33.090> looking<00:04:33.300> down

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:33.600 
straight he's constantly looking down

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:34.969 
straight he's constantly looking down
because<00:04:33.900> he<00:04:34.020> can't<00:04:34.199> move<00:04:34.320> the<00:04:34.470> head<00:04:34.620> up<00:04:34.770> or

00:04:34.969 --> 00:04:34.979 
because he can't move the head up or

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:37.159 
because he can't move the head up or
down<00:04:35.160> if<00:04:35.970> you<00:04:36.150> have<00:04:36.270> another<00:04:36.449> figure<00:04:36.780> facing

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:37.169 
down if you have another figure facing

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:38.990 
down if you have another figure facing
his<00:04:37.440> eyeline<00:04:37.770> it's<00:04:38.490> almost<00:04:38.639> as<00:04:38.789> if<00:04:38.850> he's

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:39.000 
his eyeline it's almost as if he's

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.060 
his eyeline it's almost as if he's
looking<00:04:39.240> at<00:04:39.330> his<00:04:39.449> feet<00:04:39.690> so<00:04:40.560> I<00:04:40.620> think<00:04:40.710> the<00:04:40.919> best

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:41.070 
looking at his feet so I think the best

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:42.260 
looking at his feet so I think the best
way<00:04:41.220> to<00:04:41.280> pose<00:04:41.520> him<00:04:41.550> is<00:04:41.729> by<00:04:41.850> putting<00:04:42.000> them<00:04:42.180> on

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:42.270 
way to pose him is by putting them on

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:44.450 
way to pose him is by putting them on
top<00:04:42.300> of<00:04:42.539> something<00:04:43.050> that<00:04:43.949> way<00:04:44.070> he's<00:04:44.190> looking

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:44.460 
top of something that way he's looking

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:45.980 
top of something that way he's looking
down<00:04:44.550> on<00:04:44.610> them<00:04:44.850> like<00:04:44.880> perched<00:04:45.330> over<00:04:45.509> something

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:45.990 
down on them like perched over something

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:48.350 
down on them like perched over something
but<00:04:46.169> again<00:04:47.160> this<00:04:47.400> little<00:04:47.669> flaw<00:04:47.850> I<00:04:48.030> can<00:04:48.240> look

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:48.360 
but again this little flaw I can look

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:50.029 
but again this little flaw I can look
past<00:04:48.419> it<00:04:48.780> just<00:04:48.960> it<00:04:49.110> is<00:04:49.229> such<00:04:49.410> a<00:04:49.440> nice<00:04:49.740> looking

00:04:50.029 --> 00:04:50.039 
past it just it is such a nice looking

00:04:50.039 --> 00:04:52.909 
past it just it is such a nice looking
Batman<00:04:50.460> and<00:04:50.699> in<00:04:51.240> my<00:04:51.389> opinion<00:04:51.810> it's<00:04:52.020> the<00:04:52.800> way

00:04:52.909 --> 00:04:52.919 
Batman and in my opinion it's the way

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:55.279 
Batman and in my opinion it's the way
Batman<00:04:53.160> should<00:04:53.550> look<00:04:53.789> if<00:04:54.660> you<00:04:54.960> were<00:04:55.050> to<00:04:55.139> give

00:04:55.279 --> 00:04:55.289 
Batman should look if you were to give

00:04:55.289 --> 00:04:56.719 
Batman should look if you were to give
me<00:04:55.410> a<00:04:55.440> Batman<00:04:55.860> like<00:04:56.009> this<00:04:56.220> with<00:04:56.520> better

00:04:56.719 --> 00:04:56.729 
me a Batman like this with better

00:04:56.729 --> 00:04:58.760 
me a Batman like this with better
articulation<00:04:57.300> he'd<00:04:57.600> be<00:04:57.810> definitely<00:04:58.530> the

00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:58.770 
articulation he'd be definitely the

flaw<00:06:30.990> you're<00:06:31.169> gonna<00:06:31.259> find<00:06:31.530> with<00:06:31.620> this<00:06:31.770> figure

00:06:31.939 --> 00:06:31.949 
flaw you're gonna find with this figure

00:06:31.949 --> 00:06:32.960 
flaw you're gonna find with this figure
and<00:06:32.130> I<00:06:32.159> think<00:06:32.340> it's<00:06:32.430> gonna<00:06:32.520> happen<00:06:32.729> to

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:32.970 
and I think it's gonna happen to

00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:35.000 
and I think it's gonna happen to
everyone<00:06:33.330> who<00:06:33.509> buys<00:06:33.690> this<00:06:33.870> figure<00:06:34.229> is<00:06:34.830> that

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:35.010 
everyone who buys this figure is that

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:37.760 
everyone who buys this figure is that
this<00:06:35.159> left<00:06:35.460> knee<00:06:35.760> it's<00:06:36.690> a<00:06:36.779> little<00:06:37.050> loose<00:06:37.289> as

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:37.770 
this left knee it's a little loose as

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:39.640 
this left knee it's a little loose as
you<00:06:38.070> can<00:06:38.219> see<00:06:38.340> he<00:06:38.460> goes<00:06:38.669> like<00:06:38.849> that

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:39.650 
you can see he goes like that

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:41.290 
you can see he goes like that
compared<00:06:39.979> to<00:06:40.010> this<00:06:40.130> one<00:06:40.310> which<00:06:40.460> is<00:06:40.580> nice<00:06:41.090> and

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:41.300 
compared to this one which is nice and

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:43.420 
compared to this one which is nice and
solid<00:06:41.510> see<00:06:42.290> the<00:06:42.440> top<00:06:42.650> part<00:06:42.680> how<00:06:42.949> it's<00:06:43.100> nice<00:06:43.220> and

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:43.430 
solid see the top part how it's nice and

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:46.060 
solid see the top part how it's nice and
tight<00:06:43.610> but<00:06:44.360> over<00:06:44.570> here<00:06:44.750> these<00:06:44.990> this<00:06:45.530> top<00:06:45.770> join

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:46.070 
tight but over here these this top join

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:48.189 
tight but over here these this top join
is<00:06:46.250> kind<00:06:46.460> of<00:06:46.520> like<00:06:46.639> loose<00:06:46.880> so<00:06:47.840> you<00:06:47.960> have<00:06:48.110> that

00:06:48.189 --> 00:06:48.199 
is kind of like loose so you have that

00:06:48.199 --> 00:06:49.540 
is kind of like loose so you have that
empty<00:06:48.470> space<00:06:48.800> right<00:06:48.919> there<00:06:49.130> in<00:06:49.190> between<00:06:49.280> the

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:49.550 
empty space right there in between the

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:51.879 
empty space right there in between the
joint<00:06:49.820> the<00:06:50.660> reason<00:06:51.020> for<00:06:51.169> that<00:06:51.320> because<00:06:51.620> the

00:06:51.879 --> 00:06:51.889 
joint the reason for that because the

00:06:51.889 --> 00:06:54.159 
joint the reason for that because the
way<00:06:51.979> this<00:06:52.160> figure<00:06:52.400> is<00:06:52.490> packaged<00:06:52.940> as<00:06:53.330> you<00:06:54.050> can

00:06:54.159 --> 00:06:54.169 
way this figure is packaged as you can

00:06:54.169 --> 00:06:56.050 
way this figure is packaged as you can
see<00:06:54.320> here<00:06:54.590> he's<00:06:54.860> kind<00:06:55.130> of<00:06:55.220> let<00:06:55.639> me<00:06:55.729> zoom<00:06:55.880> in<00:06:56.030> a

00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:56.060 
see here he's kind of let me zoom in a

00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:58.990 
see here he's kind of let me zoom in a
little<00:06:56.180> bit<00:06:57.010> he's<00:06:58.010> kind<00:06:58.250> of<00:06:58.310> bending<00:06:58.610> his<00:06:58.760> left

00:06:58.990 --> 00:06:59.000 
little bit he's kind of bending his left

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.870 
little bit he's kind of bending his left
knee<00:06:59.180> forward<00:06:59.540> and<00:06:59.870> I<00:07:00.530> guess<00:07:00.740> if<00:07:01.160> they<00:07:01.520> don't

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:01.880 
knee forward and I guess if they don't

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:04.000 
knee forward and I guess if they don't
position<00:07:02.389> him<00:07:02.510> right<00:07:02.720> he<00:07:03.380> might<00:07:03.530> actually

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:04.010 
position him right he might actually

00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:07.480 
position him right he might actually
Bend<00:07:04.310> him<00:07:04.520> or<00:07:04.729> overtime<00:07:05.720> might<00:07:06.020> warp<00:07:06.310> since<00:07:07.310> my

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:07.490 
Bend him or overtime might warp since my

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:09.430 
Bend him or overtime might warp since my
figure<00:07:07.760> was<00:07:07.850> packaged<00:07:08.150> like<00:07:08.300> that<00:07:08.540> when<00:07:09.410> I

00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:09.440 
figure was packaged like that when I

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:10.810 
figure was packaged like that when I
actually<00:07:09.560> opened<00:07:10.010> on<00:07:10.100> this<00:07:10.220> one<00:07:10.430> it's<00:07:10.580> loose

00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:10.820 
actually opened on this one it's loose

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:12.250 
actually opened on this one it's loose
hopefully<00:07:11.540> it<00:07:11.600> won't<00:07:11.690> affect<00:07:11.990> all<00:07:12.169> the

00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:12.260 
hopefully it won't affect all the

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:14.379 
hopefully it won't affect all the
figures<00:07:12.590> but<00:07:13.430> I<00:07:13.490> did<00:07:13.699> notice<00:07:13.850> that<00:07:14.060> this<00:07:14.180> one

00:07:14.379 --> 00:07:14.389 
figures but I did notice that this one

00:07:14.389 --> 00:07:16.719 
figures but I did notice that this one
was<00:07:14.539> loose<00:07:14.810> so<00:07:15.710> it's<00:07:15.889> a<00:07:15.949> little<00:07:16.190> loose

00:07:16.719 --> 00:07:16.729 
was loose so it's a little loose

00:07:16.729 --> 00:07:18.850 
was loose so it's a little loose
compared<00:07:17.150> to<00:07:17.210> this<00:07:17.300> one<00:07:17.539> but<00:07:18.289> it's<00:07:18.470> not<00:07:18.590> that

00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:18.860 
compared to this one but it's not that

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:21.219 
compared to this one but it's not that
loose<00:07:19.100> so<00:07:19.340> I<00:07:19.430> can<00:07:19.580> let<00:07:19.789> it<00:07:19.940> slide<00:07:20.180> and<00:07:21.020> I<00:07:21.110> am

00:07:21.219 --> 00:07:21.229 
loose so I can let it slide and I am

00:07:21.229 --> 00:07:22.330 
loose so I can let it slide and I am
noticing<00:07:21.440> that<00:07:21.620> this<00:07:21.710> other<00:07:21.919> figure<00:07:22.190> it<00:07:22.280> does

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:22.340 
noticing that this other figure it does

00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:25.360 
noticing that this other figure it does
have<00:07:22.639> the<00:07:22.760> joint<00:07:23.030> nicely<00:07:23.510> tight<00:07:24.160> it's<00:07:25.160> not

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:25.370 
have the joint nicely tight it's not

00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:26.980 
have the joint nicely tight it's not
empty<00:07:25.699> this<00:07:25.880> doesn't<00:07:26.240> have<00:07:26.330> like<00:07:26.510> that<00:07:26.630> empty

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:26.990 
empty this doesn't have like that empty

00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:29.379 
empty this doesn't have like that empty
gap<00:07:27.229> right<00:07:27.380> there<00:07:27.639> but<00:07:28.639> just<00:07:28.760> a<00:07:28.880> heads<00:07:29.060> up<00:07:29.210> to

00:07:29.379 --> 00:07:29.389 
gap right there but just a heads up to

00:07:29.389 --> 00:07:31.510 
gap right there but just a heads up to
the<00:07:29.539> toe<00:07:29.750> you<00:07:30.080> bind<00:07:30.380> this<00:07:30.500> figure<00:07:30.830> it<00:07:31.400> is

00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:31.520 
the toe you bind this figure it is

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:33.270 
the toe you bind this figure it is
something<00:07:31.669> that<00:07:31.880> might<00:07:32.060> affect<00:07:32.360> you<00:07:32.479> okay

00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:33.280 
something that might affect you okay

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:35.770 
something that might affect you okay
