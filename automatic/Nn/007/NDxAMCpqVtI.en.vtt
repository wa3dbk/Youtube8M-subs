tag<00:00:04.250> point<00:00:08.150> the<00:00:09.150> force<00:00:09.420> here<00:00:11.389> has<00:00:12.500> magnitude

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:21.170 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:35.709 

how<00:00:22.170> big<00:00:22.439> this<00:00:22.670> and<00:00:25.550> pushing<00:00:26.550> us<00:00:26.670> to<00:00:26.939> express

00:00:35.709 --> 00:00:35.719 

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:48.170 

our<00:00:36.719> teaching<00:00:37.440> force<00:00:46.610> will<00:00:47.610> be<00:00:47.760> saying<00:00:48.030> is

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
our teaching force will be saying is

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:55.630 
our teaching force will be saying is
that<00:00:48.300> doing<00:00:48.600> right<00:00:48.780> this<00:00:48.989> force<00:00:49.350> as<00:00:50.480> F<00:00:52.100> X<00:00:53.100> I

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:55.640 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:00.849 

have<00:00:56.719> twice<00:00:58.520> that's<00:00:59.520> the<00:00:59.789> thing<00:01:00.030> this<00:01:00.239> is<00:01:00.300> the

00:01:00.849 --> 00:01:00.859 
have twice that's the thing this is the

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:04.789 
have twice that's the thing this is the
Cartesian<00:01:02.000> vector<00:01:03.000> form<00:01:03.080> so<00:01:04.080> you<00:01:04.379> need<00:01:04.530> them

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
Cartesian vector form so you need them

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.929 
Cartesian vector form so you need them
you<00:01:05.070> need<00:01:05.460> sense<00:01:06.530> so<00:01:07.530> when<00:01:08.520> you<00:01:08.640> draw<00:01:08.909> the

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
you need sense so when you draw the

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.440 
you need sense so when you draw the
diagram<00:01:09.920> I'm<00:01:10.920> gonna<00:01:11.159> take<00:01:11.340> this<00:01:11.490> a<00:01:11.670> positive<00:01:11.939> x

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
diagram I'm gonna take this a positive x

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:19.030 
diagram I'm gonna take this a positive x
positive<00:01:13.189> Y<00:01:14.189> origin<00:01:16.400> you<00:01:17.400> got<00:01:17.580> the<00:01:17.790> force<00:01:18.090> as

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:19.040 
positive Y origin you got the force as

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:25.280 
positive Y origin you got the force as
800<00:01:20.040> Newtons<00:01:20.520> and<00:01:21.259> this<00:01:22.259> angle<00:01:22.710> being<00:01:23.540> 35<00:01:24.540> you

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
800 Newtons and this angle being 35 you

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:34.290 
800 Newtons and this angle being 35 you
draw<00:01:25.500> the<00:01:25.560> line<00:01:26.490> at<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:27.030> point

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:34.300 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:40.100 

this<00:01:34.570> is<00:01:34.720> going<00:01:34.960> to<00:01:35.050> become<00:01:35.140> the<00:01:36.840> X<00:01:38.340> component

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
this is going to become the X component

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.430 
this is going to become the X component
it's<00:01:41.110> Alison<00:01:41.830> that<00:01:41.980> I<00:01:42.100> present<00:01:42.520> the<00:01:43.450> Y

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:44.440 
it's Alison that I present the Y

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:50.670 
it's Alison that I present the Y
component<00:01:47.040> then<00:01:48.040> from<00:01:48.400> this<00:01:48.850> triangle<00:01:49.680> give

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:50.680 
component then from this triangle give

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:58.580 
component then from this triangle give
FX<00:01:52.770> simply<00:01:53.770> should<00:01:53.980> be<00:01:54.190> H<00:01:54.520> powdered<00:01:56.310> cosine<00:01:57.310> 35

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
FX simply should be H powdered cosine 35

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.540 
FX simply should be H powdered cosine 35
steps<00:01:59.590> it's<00:02:00.010> in<00:02:00.600> negative<00:02:01.600> x<00:02:02.080> direction<00:02:02.680> your

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:03.550 
steps it's in negative x direction your

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:13.140 
steps it's in negative x direction your
ties<00:02:03.960> negative<00:02:04.960> then<00:02:05.950> you<00:02:06.040> have<00:02:07.080> fy9<00:02:10.620> 800<00:02:12.150> sine

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
ties negative then you have fy9 800 sine

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:17.390 
ties negative then you have fy9 800 sine
45<00:02:13.660> 60<00:02:14.560> father<00:02:14.920> direction<00:02:15.640> you<00:02:16.480> keep<00:02:16.750> the<00:02:16.930> size

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
45 60 father direction you keep the size

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:23.130 
45 60 father direction you keep the size
positive<00:02:19.560> these<00:02:20.560> numbers<00:02:21.130> here<00:02:21.990> it's<00:02:22.990> gonna

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
positive these numbers here it's gonna

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:27.300 
positive these numbers here it's gonna
come<00:02:23.290> out<00:02:23.440> to<00:02:23.650> be<00:02:23.830> at<00:02:24.930> 6:55<00:02:25.930> years<00:02:26.230> and<00:02:26.500> just

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
come out to be at 6:55 years and just

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.800 
come out to be at 6:55 years and just
going<00:02:27.520> to<00:02:27.580> come<00:02:27.730> out<00:02:27.880> to<00:02:28.090> be<00:02:29.580> 450<00:02:30.580> land

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
going to come out to be 450 land

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:36.180 
going to come out to be 450 land
anything<00:02:32.010> or<00:02:33.010> your<00:02:33.610> first<00:02:33.970> ass<00:02:34.710> is<00:02:35.710> going<00:02:36.160> to

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
anything or your first ass is going to

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:40.130 
anything or your first ass is going to
be<00:02:36.570> negative<00:02:37.570> six<00:02:38.140> five<00:02:38.560> five<00:02:38.950> news

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
be negative six five five news

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:45.740 
be negative six five five news
times<00:02:41.140> I<00:02:42.480> and<00:02:43.480> then<00:02:43.870> we<00:02:43.989> got<00:02:44.170> the<00:02:44.680> second<00:02:45.340> for

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
times I and then we got the second for

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:51.540 
times I and then we got the second for
4:59<00:02:48.450> Sciences<00:02:49.450> yeah<00:02:50.220> this<00:02:51.220> is<00:02:51.310> the<00:02:51.370> same

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:51.550 
4:59 Sciences yeah this is the same

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:54.500 
4:59 Sciences yeah this is the same
thing<00:02:51.910> we<00:02:52.060> had<00:02:52.180> before<00:02:52.319> this<00:02:53.319> force<00:02:53.650> was<00:02:53.950> in

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
thing we had before this force was in

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.600 
thing we had before this force was in
second<00:02:55.510> quadrant<00:02:56.170> you<00:02:57.010> have<00:02:57.130> a<00:02:57.220> negative<00:02:57.370> here

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:57.610 
second quadrant you have a negative here

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:06.630 
second quadrant you have a negative here
and<00:02:58.180> then<00:02:59.140> it<00:02:59.920> is<00:03:00.069> a<00:03:00.099> positive<00:03:01.470> y-axis<00:03:05.430> but<00:03:06.430> it

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:06.640 
and then it is a positive y-axis but it

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:24.449 
and then it is a positive y-axis but it
is<00:03:07.110> other<00:03:10.950> inverse<00:03:11.950> problem<00:03:22.950> another<00:03:23.950> is<00:03:24.160> sin

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:24.459 
is other inverse problem another is sin

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:33.330 
is other inverse problem another is sin
inverse<00:03:25.330> problem<00:03:26.140> that<00:03:26.950> he<00:03:27.160> has<00:03:27.250> given<00:03:31.950> and<00:03:32.950> if

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.340 
inverse problem that he has given and if

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:39.780 
inverse problem that he has given and if
what<00:03:35.010> he<00:03:36.010> so<00:03:36.220> far<00:03:36.519> we<00:03:36.670> had<00:03:36.790> the<00:03:37.180> force
