crack<00:01:25.909> on<00:01:26.149> bit<00:01:27.110> of<00:01:27.200> steering<00:01:27.740> work<00:01:27.920> to<00:01:28.100> be<00:01:28.189> done

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:28.369 
crack on bit of steering work to be done

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:30.490 
crack on bit of steering work to be done
down<00:01:29.060> here<00:01:29.090> we've<00:01:29.479> got<00:01:29.539> one<00:01:29.750> universal<00:01:30.289> joint

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:30.500 
down here we've got one universal joint

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.230 
down here we've got one universal joint
put<00:01:30.710> in<00:01:30.829> here<00:01:31.070> got<00:01:31.399> the<00:01:31.490> steering<00:01:31.759> column<00:01:32.030> that

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.240 
put in here got the steering column that

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.660 
put in here got the steering column that
goes<00:01:32.420> through<00:01:32.810> into<00:01:33.259> where<00:01:33.649> the<00:01:33.829> pedal<00:01:34.250> box<00:01:34.460> is

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:34.670 
goes through into where the pedal box is

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:36.190 
goes through into where the pedal box is
here<00:01:34.970> in<00:01:35.149> the<00:01:35.240> footwell<00:01:35.659> and<00:01:35.960> on<00:01:36.020> the<00:01:36.110> other

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:36.200 
here in the footwell and on the other

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.440 
here in the footwell and on the other
side<00:01:36.289> here<00:01:36.710> with<00:01:36.860> another<00:01:37.240> universal<00:01:38.240> joint

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450 
side here with another universal joint

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:40.209 
side here with another universal joint
before<00:01:38.750> I<00:01:38.780> go<00:01:38.869> put<00:01:39.079> the<00:01:39.439> main<00:01:39.619> bracket<00:01:39.920> that

00:01:40.209 --> 00:01:40.219 
before I go put the main bracket that

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:42.130 
before I go put the main bracket that
supports<00:01:40.579> it<00:01:40.670> all<00:01:40.819> underneath<00:01:41.479> the<00:01:41.689> dash<00:01:41.899> here

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.140 
supports it all underneath the dash here

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:43.600 
supports it all underneath the dash here
so<00:01:42.380> it's<00:01:42.500> over<00:01:42.710> the<00:01:42.799> bench<00:01:42.979> to<00:01:43.130> put<00:01:43.250> a<00:01:43.280> UJ

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:43.610 
so it's over the bench to put a UJ

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:46.809 
so it's over the bench to put a UJ
together<00:01:44.350> down<00:01:45.350> here<00:01:45.380> got<00:01:46.009> both<00:01:46.250> halves<00:01:46.579> of

00:01:46.809 --> 00:01:46.819 
together down here got both halves of

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:49.270 
together down here got both halves of
the<00:01:47.000> universal<00:01:47.509> joint<00:01:47.780> so<00:01:48.110> effectively<00:01:48.950> it

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:49.280 
the universal joint so effectively it

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:50.139 
the universal joint so effectively it
will<00:01:49.369> be<00:01:49.490> able<00:01:49.580> to<00:01:49.700> move<00:01:49.789> in<00:01:49.939> that<00:01:50.030> direction

00:01:50.139 --> 00:01:50.149 
will be able to move in that direction

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:52.749 
will be able to move in that direction
and<00:01:50.869> in<00:01:51.200> that<00:01:51.530> direction<00:01:51.770> of<00:01:52.220> the<00:01:52.340> 1/2<00:01:52.520> bit

00:01:52.749 --> 00:01:52.759 
and in that direction of the 1/2 bit

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:54.219 
and in that direction of the 1/2 bit
together<00:01:52.909> already<00:01:53.329> so<00:01:53.599> it's<00:01:53.720> just<00:01:53.929> the<00:01:54.049> other

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:54.229 
together already so it's just the other

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:56.080 
together already so it's just the other
half<00:01:54.439> to<00:01:54.619> put<00:01:54.770> on<00:01:54.920> there<00:01:55.220> first<00:01:55.880> thing<00:01:56.030> you

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090 
half to put on there first thing you

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:57.760 
half to put on there first thing you
need<00:01:56.209> to<00:01:56.240> do<00:01:56.360> is<00:01:56.420> take<00:01:56.689> these<00:01:56.810> end<00:01:57.110> caps<00:01:57.259> off

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 
need to do is take these end caps off

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:01.660 
need to do is take these end caps off
and<00:01:58.099> they<00:01:58.420> very<00:01:59.420> gently<00:01:59.979> inside<00:02:00.979> you<00:02:01.280> can<00:02:01.429> see

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670 
and they very gently inside you can see

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:04.359 
and they very gently inside you can see
it's<00:02:01.880> got<00:02:02.090> little<00:02:02.649> rollers<00:02:03.649> needle<00:02:04.039> rollers

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:04.369 
it's got little rollers needle rollers

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:06.069 
it's got little rollers needle rollers
in<00:02:04.489> it<00:02:04.610> which<00:02:04.729> effective<00:02:05.149> is<00:02:05.239> a<00:02:05.270> small<00:02:05.569> bearing

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:06.079 
in it which effective is a small bearing

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:08.380 
in it which effective is a small bearing
all<00:02:06.950> greased<00:02:07.369> up<00:02:07.579> and<00:02:07.729> make<00:02:07.939> sure<00:02:08.149> you<00:02:08.269> don't

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390 
all greased up and make sure you don't

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:10.539 
all greased up and make sure you don't
drop<00:02:08.630> any<00:02:08.810> of<00:02:08.869> those<00:02:08.989> out<00:02:09.289> take<00:02:10.069> the<00:02:10.190> other<00:02:10.399> one

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:10.549 
drop any of those out take the other one

00:02:10.549 --> 00:02:14.380 
drop any of those out take the other one
off<00:02:10.610> as<00:02:10.970> well<00:02:12.489> like<00:02:13.489> so<00:02:13.819> then<00:02:14.150> you<00:02:14.239> can

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
off as well like so then you can

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.190 
off as well like so then you can
actually<00:02:14.750> fit<00:02:15.709> over<00:02:16.360> the<00:02:17.360> second<00:02:17.750> part<00:02:17.989> of<00:02:18.140> the

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
actually fit over the second part of the

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.009 
actually fit over the second part of the
universal<00:02:18.650> joint<00:02:18.680> like<00:02:19.250> so<00:02:19.639> and<00:02:20.090> then<00:02:20.810> you

00:02:21.009 --> 00:02:21.019 
universal joint like so and then you

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:25.420 
universal joint like so and then you
just<00:02:21.950> slide<00:02:22.400> on<00:02:22.700> the<00:02:23.269> end<00:02:23.420> the<00:02:23.540> cap<00:02:24.220> push<00:02:25.220> that

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
just slide on the end the cap push that

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:26.940 
just slide on the end the cap push that
in

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
in

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:28.530 
in
you<00:02:27.550> may<00:02:27.730> be<00:02:27.790> able<00:02:28.030> to<00:02:28.090> get<00:02:28.209> it<00:02:28.330> with<00:02:28.450> your

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
you may be able to get it with your

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.059 
you may be able to get it with your
thumb<00:02:28.780> otherwise<00:02:29.170> at<00:02:29.349> least<00:02:29.530> go<00:02:29.680> in<00:02:29.739> the<00:02:29.830> vise

00:02:30.059 --> 00:02:30.069 
thumb otherwise at least go in the vise

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:35.729 
thumb otherwise at least go in the vise
so<00:02:31.349> opening<00:02:32.349> the<00:02:32.440> vise<00:02:32.620> like<00:02:32.860> so<00:02:34.470> and<00:02:35.470> then<00:02:35.620> to

00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:35.739 
so opening the vise like so and then to

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:38.610 
so opening the vise like so and then to
help<00:02:35.890> push<00:02:36.129> it<00:02:36.160> through<00:02:37.080> once<00:02:38.080> it's<00:02:38.260> gone<00:02:38.470> all

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
help push it through once it's gone all

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:40.830 
help push it through once it's gone all
the<00:02:38.860> way<00:02:38.890> like<00:02:39.730> that<00:02:39.970> so<00:02:40.180> we<00:02:40.239> go<00:02:40.360> a<00:02:40.390> bit<00:02:40.480> further

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
the way like that so we go a bit further

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.339 
the way like that so we go a bit further
by<00:02:41.140> just<00:02:41.349> putting<00:02:41.620> in<00:02:41.800> a<00:02:42.010> socket<00:02:43.170> and<00:02:44.170> that

00:02:44.339 --> 00:02:44.349 
by just putting in a socket and that

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:47.000 
by just putting in a socket and that
will<00:02:44.440> go<00:02:44.590> in<00:02:44.739> there<00:02:45.090> and<00:02:46.090> actually<00:02:46.209> push<00:02:46.540> it

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
will go in there and actually push it

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.470 
will go in there and actually push it
further<00:02:48.010> through<00:02:48.459> than<00:02:48.610> it<00:02:48.730> should<00:02:48.940> be<00:02:49.180> and

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
further through than it should be and

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.650 
further through than it should be and
that<00:02:49.660> then<00:02:49.870> leaves<00:02:50.140> there<00:02:50.980> we<00:02:51.040> go<00:02:51.220> on<00:02:52.150> here<00:02:52.420> you

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
that then leaves there we go on here you

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:54.449 
that then leaves there we go on here you
can<00:02:52.720> see<00:02:52.930> a<00:02:52.959> groove<00:02:53.319> which<00:02:53.650> is<00:02:53.799> where<00:02:53.950> a<00:02:53.980> circle

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:54.459 
can see a groove which is where a circle

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:55.890 
can see a groove which is where a circle
it<00:02:54.549> fits<00:02:54.849> which<00:02:55.030> holds<00:02:55.360> it<00:02:55.450> and<00:02:55.569> stops<00:02:55.780> the

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
it fits which holds it and stops the

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.050 
it fits which holds it and stops the
whole<00:02:56.019> thing<00:02:56.230> falling<00:02:56.440> to<00:02:56.650> pieces<00:02:56.910> you<00:02:57.910> need

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
whole thing falling to pieces you need

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:01.170 
whole thing falling to pieces you need
your<00:02:58.209> circlip<00:02:58.599> pliers<00:02:59.340> pick<00:03:00.340> up<00:03:00.459> the<00:03:00.610> clip<00:03:00.910> and

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
your circlip pliers pick up the clip and

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.479 
your circlip pliers pick up the clip and
just<00:03:01.510> drop<00:03:01.840> it<00:03:01.989> into<00:03:02.110> the<00:03:02.290> slot<00:03:02.590> goes<00:03:03.160> in<00:03:03.400> a

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:03.489 
just drop it into the slot goes in a

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:06.960 
just drop it into the slot goes in a
treat<00:03:04.319> see<00:03:05.319> that<00:03:05.500> really<00:03:05.709> nicely<00:03:05.890> there<00:03:06.280> then

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:06.970 
treat see that really nicely there then

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:10.650 
treat see that really nicely there then
it's<00:03:07.150> back<00:03:07.329> into<00:03:07.510> the<00:03:07.599> vise<00:03:09.150> to<00:03:10.150> go<00:03:10.299> back<00:03:10.510> the

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:10.660 
it's back into the vise to go back the

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:13.110 
it's back into the vise to go back the
other<00:03:10.840> way<00:03:10.959> to<00:03:11.140> push<00:03:11.500> it<00:03:11.620> back<00:03:11.799> the<00:03:12.700> other<00:03:12.730> side

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
other way to push it back the other side

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.960 
other way to push it back the other side
with<00:03:13.599> the<00:03:13.690> other<00:03:13.720> end<00:03:14.079> cap<00:03:14.349> in<00:03:14.730> that's<00:03:15.730> going

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970 
with the other end cap in that's going

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:18.420 
with the other end cap in that's going
through<00:03:16.090> nicely<00:03:16.920> just<00:03:17.920> push<00:03:18.160> it<00:03:18.340> a<00:03:18.370> bit

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:18.430 
through nicely just push it a bit

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:28.410 
through nicely just push it a bit
further<00:03:22.140> here<00:03:23.140> we<00:03:23.230> go<00:03:24.959> and<00:03:25.959> then<00:03:27.030> we<00:03:28.030> can<00:03:28.180> drop

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:28.420 
further here we go and then we can drop

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:30.080 
further here we go and then we can drop
in

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
in

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:35.619 
in
the<00:03:30.630> other<00:03:30.810> clear

00:03:35.619 --> 00:03:35.629 

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:44.309 

like<00:03:36.260> so<00:03:36.590> and<00:03:37.069> they<00:03:37.280> have<00:03:37.310> a<00:03:38.859> universal<00:03:39.859> joints

00:03:44.309 --> 00:03:44.319 

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:46.750 

in<00:03:45.319> the<00:03:45.469> end<00:03:45.590> there<00:03:45.859> but<00:03:46.310> I've<00:03:46.400> taken<00:03:46.609> the

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:46.760 
in the end there but I've taken the

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:48.520 
in the end there but I've taken the
pinch<00:03:46.999> bolt<00:03:47.299> out<00:03:47.540> you<00:03:47.959> can<00:03:48.079> see<00:03:48.230> there's<00:03:48.469> a

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:48.530 
pinch bolt out you can see there's a

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:50.530 
pinch bolt out you can see there's a
groove<00:03:49.400> in<00:03:49.639> there<00:03:49.819> which<00:03:49.999> the<00:03:50.120> beach<00:03:50.299> ball

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:50.540 
groove in there which the beach ball

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:53.440 
groove in there which the beach ball
sits<00:03:50.840> in<00:03:51.049> so<00:03:51.379> you<00:03:52.010> just<00:03:52.189> slot<00:03:52.909> it<00:03:53.030> over<00:03:53.269> the<00:03:53.389> end

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:53.450 
sits in so you just slot it over the end

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:58.629 
sits in so you just slot it over the end
like<00:03:53.810> you<00:03:53.840> say<00:03:55.269> in<00:03:56.269> the<00:03:56.359> pinch<00:03:56.569> bolt<00:03:57.639> pops

00:03:58.629 --> 00:03:58.639 
like you say in the pinch bolt pops

00:03:58.639 --> 00:04:01.869 
like you say in the pinch bolt pops
through<00:03:58.879> and<00:03:59.209> locks<00:03:59.569> it<00:03:59.780> in<00:03:59.870> place<00:03:59.900> so<00:04:00.879> then

00:04:01.869 --> 00:04:01.879 
through and locks it in place so then

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:04.149 
through and locks it in place so then
physically<00:04:02.569> cannot<00:04:02.870> it's<00:04:03.469> a<00:04:03.530> locked<00:04:03.739> in<00:04:03.950> place

00:04:04.149 --> 00:04:04.159 
physically cannot it's a locked in place

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:06.009 
physically cannot it's a locked in place
it<00:04:04.400> can't<00:04:04.579> come<00:04:04.819> off<00:04:04.909> there's<00:04:05.450> then<00:04:05.599> an<00:04:05.719> upper

00:04:06.009 --> 00:04:06.019 
it can't come off there's then an upper

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:07.659 
it can't come off there's then an upper
steering<00:04:06.409> column<00:04:06.680> to<00:04:06.769> go<00:04:06.889> on<00:04:07.010> there<00:04:07.219> and<00:04:07.459> an<00:04:07.549> up

00:04:07.659 --> 00:04:07.669 
steering column to go on there and an up

00:04:07.669 --> 00:04:10.149 
steering column to go on there and an up
steering<00:04:08.090> column<00:04:08.419> bracket<00:04:08.959> which<00:04:09.139> fixes<00:04:09.980> or

00:04:10.149 --> 00:04:10.159 
steering column bracket which fixes or

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:11.920 
steering column bracket which fixes or
supports<00:04:10.549> the<00:04:10.609> steering<00:04:10.969> column<00:04:11.150> onto<00:04:11.840> the

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:11.930 
supports the steering column onto the

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:13.209 
supports the steering column onto the
bulkhead<00:04:12.290> here<00:04:12.500> those<00:04:12.709> are<00:04:12.829> the<00:04:12.919> next<00:04:12.980> two

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:13.219 
bulkhead here those are the next two

00:04:13.219 --> 00:04:15.009 
bulkhead here those are the next two
jobs<00:04:13.519> and<00:04:13.760> then<00:04:13.879> I'm<00:04:14.419> gonna<00:04:14.540> start<00:04:14.659> working<00:04:14.870> on

00:04:15.009 --> 00:04:15.019 
jobs and then I'm gonna start working on

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:19.370 
jobs and then I'm gonna start working on
the<00:04:15.169> dash

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:21.620 

now<00:04:19.980> you<00:04:20.070> might<00:04:20.250> think<00:04:20.280> wiring<00:04:21.030> up<00:04:21.150> this<00:04:21.360> beast

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:21.630 
now you might think wiring up this beast

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:23.540 
now you might think wiring up this beast
is<00:04:21.840> a<00:04:21.870> tad<00:04:22.170> complicated<00:04:22.950> because<00:04:23.100> of<00:04:23.400> all

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:23.550 
is a tad complicated because of all

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:25.550 
is a tad complicated because of all
these<00:04:23.790> wires<00:04:24.300> and<00:04:24.660> different<00:04:25.020> colors<00:04:25.320> and<00:04:25.470> all

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560 
these wires and different colors and all

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.410 
these wires and different colors and all
the<00:04:25.710> rest<00:04:25.860> of<00:04:25.980> it<00:04:26.100> but<00:04:26.190> actually<00:04:26.370> if<00:04:27.270> you<00:04:27.390> look

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:27.420 
the rest of it but actually if you look

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:29.180 
the rest of it but actually if you look
at<00:04:27.600> the<00:04:27.690> manual<00:04:28.020> you<00:04:28.140> soon<00:04:28.440> discover<00:04:28.890> it's

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:29.190 
at the manual you soon discover it's

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:32.510 
at the manual you soon discover it's
very<00:04:29.910> very<00:04:30.510> very<00:04:30.960> complicated<00:04:31.410> because<00:04:32.160> this

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:32.520 
very very very complicated because this

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.820 
very very very complicated because this
is<00:04:32.790> the<00:04:33.000> wiring<00:04:33.390> diagram<00:04:33.810> of<00:04:34.380> how<00:04:34.440> you<00:04:34.620> have<00:04:34.740> to

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:34.830 
is the wiring diagram of how you have to

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:37.730 
is the wiring diagram of how you have to
put<00:04:34.950> it<00:04:35.040> all<00:04:35.220> together<00:04:35.400> one<00:04:36.030> do<00:04:36.180> first<00:04:36.600> is<00:04:36.960> the

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:37.740 
put it all together one do first is the

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:40.850 
put it all together one do first is the
fuses<00:04:38.220> here<00:04:38.600> and<00:04:39.600> you<00:04:39.870> can<00:04:40.020> see<00:04:40.290> on<00:04:40.500> the<00:04:40.710> back

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:40.860
