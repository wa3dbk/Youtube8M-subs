are some advantages and disadvantages to
the<00:01:44.319> system<00:01:44.649> will<00:01:45.399> talk<00:01:45.640> about<00:01:45.819> the

the system will talk about the

the system will talk about the
disadvantages<00:01:46.689> right<00:01:46.959> now<00:01:47.200> but<00:01:47.770> we'll<00:01:47.860> come

00:01:48.089 --> 00:01:48.099 
disadvantages right now but we'll come

00:01:48.099 --> 00:01:49.649 
disadvantages right now but we'll come
back<00:01:48.369> to<00:01:48.520> the<00:01:48.610> advantages<00:01:49.119> by<00:01:49.270> the<00:01:49.329> end<00:01:49.509> of<00:01:49.569> the

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:49.659 
back to the advantages by the end of the

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:53.190 
back to the advantages by the end of the
video<00:01:49.810> for<00:01:50.739> one<00:01:50.950> it's<00:01:51.789> not<00:01:52.000> very<00:01:52.209> scalable<00:01:52.750> if

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:53.200 
video for one it's not very scalable if

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.229 
video for one it's not very scalable if
your<00:01:53.409> business<00:01:53.649> gets<00:01:54.009> more<00:01:54.280> employees<00:01:54.729> you

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:55.239 
your business gets more employees you

00:01:55.239 --> 00:01:57.300 
your business gets more employees you
can<00:01:55.360> have<00:01:55.509> to<00:01:55.659> get<00:01:55.780> a<00:01:55.810> whole<00:01:56.110> new<00:01:56.140> pbx<00:01:56.890> if<00:01:57.159> you

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:57.310 
can have to get a whole new pbx if you

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:59.339 
can have to get a whole new pbx if you
wanted<00:01:57.579> more<00:01:57.729> extensions<00:01:58.270> like<00:01:58.479> in<00:01:59.140> the<00:01:59.229> last

00:01:59.339 --> 00:01:59.349 
wanted more extensions like in the last

00:01:59.349 --> 00:02:01.619 
wanted more extensions like in the last
example<00:01:59.590> the<00:02:00.310> business<00:02:00.670> only<00:02:00.849> had<00:02:01.119> 15

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:01.629 
example the business only had 15

00:02:01.629 --> 00:02:04.289 
example the business only had 15
extensions<00:02:02.170> so<00:02:02.859> the<00:02:03.039> 16th<00:02:03.369> employee<00:02:03.789> wants<00:02:04.149> a

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:04.299 
extensions so the 16th employee wants a

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:07.859 
extensions so the 16th employee wants a
phone<00:02:04.799> tough<00:02:05.799> line<00:02:06.090> the<00:02:07.090> same<00:02:07.329> thing<00:02:07.359> applies

00:02:07.859 --> 00:02:07.869 
phone tough line the same thing applies

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:10.080 
phone tough line the same thing applies
to<00:02:08.109> lines<00:02:08.349> if<00:02:08.890> your<00:02:09.099> businesses<00:02:09.609> wants<00:02:09.849> to<00:02:09.970> be

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.090 
to lines if your businesses wants to be

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:11.910
