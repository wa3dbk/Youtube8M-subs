 said android based exactly did you 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.340
 say it is actually an android only 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:38.610

 is available for almost all devices and 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.059
 especially if you think of the 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.399
 manufacturer no update gets on the 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:48.110

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.120
 devices are supported i show 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.160
 today a very specific solution like you 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.550

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.350
 can 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.930
 you really do not have much to do that 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.719
 do this and there is an app for that 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.189
 or a program for windows and this 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:09.030
 program works just with 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:10.320
 certain devices I will all devices 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.229
 you again later say that 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.760
 we are supported to talk here 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.340
 is of course the latest 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:22.110
 ancelotti wants her and right now and that 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:23.060
 is a mod 11 which android 4.4 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.619
 supports 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.090
 So what brings you to one? 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.040
 Short introduction at the beginning again 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.810
 come yes we have the same time in the beginning 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.400
 the nice lockscreen with a short 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.170
 cuts can translate that we can in 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.150

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:46.570
 this sally bott android 4.4 on my 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.369
 it's three with only 4.3 running 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:52.810
 would be loud samsung and we can 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:55.240
 Some apps allow root access new ones 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:56.680
 unlike android vanilla is 4.4 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.000
 also that one has the possibility 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:59.890
 create profiles 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.270
 that means you can for example for 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:03.090
 different places different profiles 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:05.409
 create and at will 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.679
 individualize for example gps and 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:10.090

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:50.540
 who did not come here now 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:52.730
 there is also an app for that 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:54.110
 in the cell mod installer there is 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:55.879
 you do not go to the place gate but you do 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:57.470
 she can often download chip 

00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:59.180
 a link to grab the video 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:00.769
 description this app explains you 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:02.420
 in detail what settings you 

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:05.290
 had to like me just now 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:05.290
 have described 

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:10.390
 no matter in which way we ours 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:12.370
 have performed adjustment 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:16.920
 then begins in our web 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:16.920
 browser on peter point cn 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:27.360
 on this page then again 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:29.910
 everything written in english 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:32.760
 At the bottom of the page you can 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:37.010
 then the program which you on 

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:37.010
 Download computer needs 

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:50.030
 here the program opens and confirms 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:50.030
 to carry out the safety warning 

00:04:51.439 --> 00:04:56.219
 then follows the all instructions 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:58.340
 that shows you the program that is 

00:04:56.219 --> 00:05:00.599
 You first have to scan expensive anti virus 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:02.280
 disable and then the program 

00:05:00.599 --> 00:05:04.919
 in his work you have to start for it 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:07.469
 you only the phone with the usb cable 

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:09.629
 connect the computer and that 

00:05:07.469 --> 00:05:10.560
 Program does the rest all this 

00:05:09.629 --> 00:05:12.960
 of course you will find again 

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:17.210
 described in the program is in it 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:19.080
 So only do what you are told 

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:21.150
 otherwise , of course, would have to consider 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:22.800
 that in this all proceed on the 

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:23.310
 lost phone data 

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:24.960
 go 

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:26.939
 there is a possibility, however 

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:28.590
 to secure everything that works 

00:05:26.939 --> 00:05:29.159
 Example with an app like titanium 

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:31.620
 backup 

00:05:29.159 --> 00:05:33.090
 For this he usually needs the red 

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:34.620
 you also need a root order 

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:36.569
 to install his job 

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:38.159
 But that also does the program for 

00:05:36.569 --> 00:05:40.370
 you though, if you have your data 

00:05:38.159 --> 00:05:42.960
 You still need to secure first 

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:44.219
 telephone routes have a guide to it 

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:47.310
 I also in the video description 

00:05:44.219 --> 00:05:50.039
 packed afterwards you can buy titanium backup 

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:53.779
 Download from the place de and yours 

00:05:50.039 --> 00:05:55.650
 Backing up data from the apps with user data 

00:05:53.779 --> 00:05:57.779
 all other data like for example 

00:05:55.650 --> 00:06:00.800
 music pictures and videos you can 

00:05:57.779 --> 00:06:04.650
 just so secure on your computer 

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:06.779
