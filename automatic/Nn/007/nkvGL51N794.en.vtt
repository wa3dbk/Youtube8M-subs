00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.980
 the beauty you see now 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:07.859
 consider official descendants wild 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.120
 Bengal cat in nature they are referred to 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:11.610
 genus of oriental cats 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.500
 but they became home recently 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.920
 thanks to the hard work on 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.119
 we are species animals 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:20.369
 selective work for many years 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.820
 Jane Mill was doing American 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.310
 biologist 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:27.269
 geneticist and just a mustache lover 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:29.220
 1981 murloc she showed how 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:32.460
 says their family and friends made 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.739
 first pets bred eighty 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.350
 the third year she risk you enter on 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.980
 the exhibition of course people took it violently 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.840
 ambiguous someone for someone against 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:45.920
 very afraid of these cats and already in 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:48.000
 ninety first year 1 only may have been 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.829
 documented as 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.690
 breed 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:53.760
 Bengal cats are very similar 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.239
 on their wild relatives and even 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:59.340
 they squat slinking gait 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:00.329
 the breed creator's idea was to 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.309
 show people 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.680
 how beautiful can be wild 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.080
 nature at home however 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.720
 similarity to predatory relatives not only 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:13.500
 external home pingala is also insane 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:17.580
 love water and green vegetation they 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:19.740
 love nature they love space they 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.229
 have to walk outside 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.540
 it is necessary to release periodically though 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:27.030
 would it be more if less 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.770
 degrees it was here they love 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.920
 territory is not small 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.600
 fettered for this reason such cats 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.299
 difficult to keep in the party 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.640
 they need the space of a private house more 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:40.470
 In addition, there is another nuance that is worth 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.820
 take into account those who decided to start yourself 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.130
 male bengal 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.350
 he is guaranteed to mark everything 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.270
 around going back to what's wild 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:52.530
 blood and in the wild it 's very 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:56.100
 important territory all marked here and 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:58.740
 they are especially hard smell labels here 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:03.240
 this again for this 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:06.240
 wildness once again confirms that this 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.799
 nuance such there is such a pet 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.899
 not everyone will choose 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:11.510
 of many people 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:13.819
 wild looks even scary need to be 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:16.280
 fan of predatory feline to 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:18.920
 feel the beauty of the Bengal cat 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:21.799
 and meanwhile, about the intelligence and ingenuity of these 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:24.319
 animals can talk for hours they 

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:27.650
 get along well with children and never 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:29.959
 show aggression to man for 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.700
 a few minutes is difficult to fully describe 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:33.439
 this breed 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:36.200
 Bengal cats conquer their grace 

00:02:33.439 --> 00:02:38.090
 movements and gaze as if given 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:40.370
 opportunity to look into the key 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:44.440
 well for the wild world in which 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:44.440
 seemingly no place for man
