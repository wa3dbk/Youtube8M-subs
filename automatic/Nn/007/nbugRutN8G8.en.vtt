greetings tankers my name is that and in

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:07.220 
greetings tankers my name is that and in
this<00:00:05.790> video<00:00:05.970> I'm<00:00:06.240> gonna<00:00:06.420> be<00:00:06.509> talking<00:00:06.629> a<00:00:07.049> bit

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:07.230 
this video I'm gonna be talking a bit

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:08.870 
this video I'm gonna be talking a bit
about<00:00:07.259> angles<00:00:07.890> of<00:00:08.010> impact<00:00:08.490> and<00:00:08.760> the

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880 
about angles of impact and the

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.910 
about angles of impact and the
deflection<00:00:09.150> and<00:00:09.630> how<00:00:09.960> to<00:00:10.019> use<00:00:10.260> this<00:00:10.469> knowledge

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
deflection and how to use this knowledge

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.190 
deflection and how to use this knowledge
to<00:00:11.130> your<00:00:11.370> advantage<00:00:11.820> and<00:00:12.240> he<00:00:12.480> will<00:00:12.630> understand

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
to your advantage and he will understand

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.129 
to your advantage and he will understand
why<00:00:13.740> you<00:00:13.799> sometimes<00:00:14.400> one<00:00:14.700> hit<00:00:14.910> 5t<00:00:15.540> to<00:00:15.719> divorce

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
why you sometimes one hit 5t to divorce

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.470 
why you sometimes one hit 5t to divorce

shots that hits in a row I've been

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:24.890 
shots that hits in a row I've been
talking<00:00:23.550> about<00:00:23.789> different<00:00:24.210> ammo<00:00:24.420> types<00:00:24.660> and

the actual projectile itself also on the
angle<00:00:31.230> at<00:00:31.349> which<00:00:31.380> a<00:00:31.769> shell<00:00:32.219> hits<00:00:32.460> its<00:00:32.700> target

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
angle at which a shell hits its target

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.540 
angle at which a shell hits its target
right<00:00:33.719> angle<00:00:34.140> 90<00:00:34.530> degrees<00:00:34.980> gives<00:00:35.280> you<00:00:35.399> the

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
right angle 90 degrees gives you the

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.490 
right angle 90 degrees gives you the
highest<00:00:35.850> chance<00:00:36.030> of<00:00:36.239> penetration<00:00:36.660> the<00:00:37.320> lower

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
highest chance of penetration the lower

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:38.990 
highest chance of penetration the lower
the<00:00:37.680> angle<00:00:37.860> the<00:00:38.219> lower<00:00:38.340> your<00:00:38.579> chance<00:00:38.850> of

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
the angle the lower your chance of

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.790 
the angle the lower your chance of
causing<00:00:39.180> a<00:00:39.360> critical<00:00:39.870> hit<00:00:40.050> if<00:00:40.290> the<00:00:40.500> angle

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
causing a critical hit if the angle

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.920 
causing a critical hit if the angle
drops<00:00:41.010> below<00:00:41.250> 30<00:00:41.610> there's<00:00:42.180> a<00:00:42.239> high<00:00:42.450> chance<00:00:42.690> the

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
drops below 30 there's a high chance the

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.479 
drops below 30 there's a high chance the
shot<00:00:43.140> will<00:00:43.320> deflect<00:00:43.649> what<00:00:44.070> does<00:00:44.190> this<00:00:44.309> mean

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
shot will deflect what does this mean

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.910 
shot will deflect what does this mean
for<00:00:44.520> you<00:00:44.789> let's<00:00:45.270> look<00:00:45.450> at<00:00:45.600> the<00:00:45.750> t-34<00:00:46.530> side

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
for you let's look at the t-34 side

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.010 
for you let's look at the t-34 side
armor<00:00:47.219> for<00:00:47.399> example<00:00:47.879> if<00:00:48.059> you're<00:00:48.480> at<00:00:48.660> the<00:00:48.809> same

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
armor for example if you're at the same

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.930 
armor for example if you're at the same
level<00:00:49.289> your<00:00:49.559> shots<00:00:49.860> will<00:00:50.039> hit<00:00:50.250> the<00:00:50.430> armor<00:00:50.760> and

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
level your shots will hit the armor and

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.630 
level your shots will hit the armor and
rayna<00:00:51.120> around<00:00:51.690> 45<00:00:52.199> degrees<00:00:52.230> angle<00:00:52.829> if<00:00:53.489> the

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
rayna around 45 degrees angle if the

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.029 
rayna around 45 degrees angle if the
t-34<00:00:54.270> sits<00:00:54.570> sloped<00:00:55.020> on<00:00:55.350> the<00:00:55.500> side<00:00:55.680> of<00:00:55.710> a<00:00:55.890> hill

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
t-34 sits sloped on the side of a hill

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.670 
t-34 sits sloped on the side of a hill
for<00:00:56.250> example<00:00:56.670> it's<00:00:56.879> even<00:00:57.210> less<00:00:57.530> Germans<00:00:58.530> on

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
for example it's even less Germans on

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.619 
for example it's even less Germans on
the<00:00:58.710> other<00:00:58.920> hand<00:00:59.190> prefer<00:00:59.640> almost<00:01:00.059> vertical

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
the other hand prefer almost vertical

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.510 
the other hand prefer almost vertical
armor<00:01:00.870> plates<00:01:01.140> and<00:01:01.379> the<00:01:01.469> t-34<00:01:02.100> on<00:01:02.219> the<00:01:02.340> same

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
armor plates and the t-34 on the same

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.340 
armor plates and the t-34 on the same
level<00:01:02.699> is<00:01:02.910> going<00:01:03.180> to<00:01:03.300> have<00:01:03.449> ideal<00:01:03.809> conditions

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
level is going to have ideal conditions

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.230 
level is going to have ideal conditions
for<00:01:04.379> penetration<00:01:04.920> on<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:05.610> other<00:01:05.760> hand<00:01:06.030> of<00:01:06.150> the

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
for penetration on the other hand of the

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.149 
for penetration on the other hand of the
German<00:01:06.510> cannons<00:01:06.869> vertical<00:01:07.380> guidance<00:01:07.650> allows

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
German cannons vertical guidance allows

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:09.740 
German cannons vertical guidance allows
them<00:01:08.369> to<00:01:08.549> aim<00:01:08.880> downwards

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
them to aim downwards

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.630 
them to aim downwards
therefore<00:01:10.229> they<00:01:10.350> are<00:01:10.470> perfect<00:01:10.950> for<00:01:11.100> getting

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
therefore they are perfect for getting

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.219 
therefore they are perfect for getting
into<00:01:11.790> an<00:01:12.000> elevated<00:01:12.450> position<00:01:12.570> and<00:01:12.960> shooting

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
into an elevated position and shooting

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:14.840 
into an elevated position and shooting
down<00:01:13.409> in<00:01:13.590> the<00:01:13.710> Russians<00:01:14.040> at<00:01:14.189> which<00:01:14.369> point<00:01:14.640> the

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
down in the Russians at which point the

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.249 
down in the Russians at which point the
Germans<00:01:15.240> increase<00:01:15.659> their<00:01:15.900> chance<00:01:16.170> of

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
Germans increase their chance of

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:17.929 
Germans increase their chance of
penetration<00:01:16.710> as<00:01:17.040> they<00:01:17.310> will<00:01:17.520> be<00:01:17.549> hitting<00:01:17.790> the

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
penetration as they will be hitting the

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.060 
penetration as they will be hitting the
soft<00:01:18.270> armor<00:01:18.600> at<00:01:18.689> a<00:01:18.720> better<00:01:18.960> angle<00:01:19.320> and<00:01:19.530> their
