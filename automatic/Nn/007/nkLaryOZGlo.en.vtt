00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.089 
the 5th 2012 it was born on Mars that
day<00:00:27.000> and<00:00:27.240> so<00:00:27.750> we<00:00:27.930> considered<00:00:28.380> that<00:00:28.410> day<00:00:28.710> as<00:00:28.920> its

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
day and so we considered that day as its

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.580 
day and so we considered that day as its
birthday<00:00:29.539> we're<00:00:30.539> here<00:00:30.750> at<00:00:30.869> the<00:00:30.900> testament<00:00:31.439> lab

running some great science experiments
on<00:00:45.090> Mars<00:00:45.360> we<00:00:45.930> will<00:00:46.050> be<00:00:46.140> analyzing<00:00:46.320> some<00:00:46.890> soil

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
on Mars we will be analyzing some soil

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.790 
on Mars we will be analyzing some soil
samples<00:00:47.280> to<00:00:48.239> make<00:00:48.480> the<00:00:48.719> soil<00:00:48.960> samples<00:00:49.379> go<00:00:49.530> down

samples to make the soil samples go down

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.740 
samples to make the soil samples go down
we<00:00:50.219> had<00:00:50.250> to<00:00:50.489> program<00:00:50.730> it<00:00:51.059> through<00:00:51.270> vibrate

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
we had to program it through vibrate

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.810 
we had to program it through vibrate
various<00:00:52.289> frequencies<00:00:52.670> when<00:00:53.670> we're

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
various frequencies when we're

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.240 
various frequencies when we're
introducing<00:00:53.969> a<00:00:54.420> sample<00:00:55.050> into<00:00:55.410> Sam<00:00:55.710> you'll<00:00:56.070> go

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
introducing a sample into Sam you'll go

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.650 
introducing a sample into Sam you'll go
through<00:00:56.460> a<00:00:56.520> resonance<00:00:57.000> and<00:00:57.210> you'll<00:00:57.449> sound

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
through a resonance and you'll sound

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:07.219 
through a resonance and you'll sound
like<00:00:57.840> this

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.109
