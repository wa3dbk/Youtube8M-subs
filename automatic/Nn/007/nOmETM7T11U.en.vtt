 that will be done is that they welcomed the 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:23.880
 arrival of this competitor since they will see 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:26.850

 dollars a year and would take three years to 

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:39.769
 to pay this investment of 19 billion 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:41.810
 dollars 

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:43.819
