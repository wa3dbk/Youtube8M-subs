00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:57.340
 putting how I'm going to organize it as 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:01.690
 I saw how good is going to be with a 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:07.080
 page and right now call such jones the 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:09.760
 what does 16 good can do from 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:11.500
 this one with which he organized himself in the tournament 

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:14.110
 pokemon that we organized a long time ago 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.610
 time and good that this would be a 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:18.930
 good list depending on how many 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.930
 we have clear and good 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:32.910
 and it has already happened that they will close and if 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:34.950
 be because I think it's better a bit like that 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:36.450
 would be putting who vargas until we 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.060
 puts on valencia putting time 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:41.550
 going to the final and then there will be a 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:43.680
 bronze medal for the third and 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:48.319
 fourth place 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:50.959
 those that belong the final of distribution 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:54.709
 and there are going to be a number of ways 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:58.790
 some because it would not be fair 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:03:00.980
 for example the four of opsis and good 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:02.749
 is going to tell us a bit that we can be 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:06.489
 banned if you know 

00:03:02.749 --> 00:03:13.280
 we started, we have first youtube 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:18.310
 friend rain with joe levy that work grow 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:23.590
 do not cry cubata tours and oxy if you already 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:29.060
 say any gratina manaf scripts and 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:32.480
 dark ride gaming artells victim 3 iran 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:35.569
 of chrome you're in your in that of 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:37.969
 melo eta y yen and as you can see almost all 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:39.859
 the legendary except the chatÃ³n and 

00:03:37.969 --> 00:03:41.870
 these are the list of pokemon that do not go 

00:03:39.859 --> 00:03:46.969
 to be used in the tournament is good 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:49.180
 but to be able to create the team is already 

00:03:46.969 --> 00:03:49.180
 good 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:04.190
 because they are too many 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:08.550
 you can use anything any 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:10.920
 kind of weather which anything was 

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:13.190
 done - it's a little better and as I believe in 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:13.190
 the team 

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:20.070
 once chosen the name of Justin 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:22.380
 bieber and new team 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:25.130
 here you put the format or an always 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:25.130
 please 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:30.390
 and adding pokemon is in English 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:32.370
 good and here come all types of 

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:33.810
 few that you can catch except the 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:40.400
 credits that do not have the description 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:40.400
 because you could use 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:48.650
 and well that's the only 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:50.360
 rival who has the tournament 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:51.740
 but then you can use anything 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:54.850
 any skill that lets you be 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:54.850
 good to create them 

00:04:56.169 --> 00:05:07.760
 if you want the skill that work too 

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:11.210
 is allowed 

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:16.580
 you can take both hands 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:19.400
 I clarify because I have made clear why 

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:21.759
 says that you can only use one thread 

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:21.759
 tim ward 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:27.449
 and good a little more to say 

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:38.139

00:05:36.129 --> 00:05:40.090

00:05:38.139 --> 00:05:42.280

00:05:55.500 --> 00:06:04.890
 make it clear so there was nothing 

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:06.570
