we've<00:02:14.550> made<00:02:14.730> these<00:02:14.940> tests<00:02:15.360> on<00:02:15.480> a<00:02:15.510> runway<00:02:15.750> like

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
we've made these tests on a runway like

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:17.420 
we've made these tests on a runway like
this<00:02:16.320> one<00:02:16.470> here<00:02:16.710> under<00:02:16.980> wet<00:02:17.130> and<00:02:17.280> dry

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
this one here under wet and dry

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.360 
this one here under wet and dry
conditions<00:02:17.630> we<00:02:18.630> find<00:02:18.990> that<00:02:19.110> these<00:02:19.320> ratios<00:02:19.650> are

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
conditions we find that these ratios are

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.090 
conditions we find that these ratios are
the<00:02:20.400> same<00:02:20.580> or<00:02:21.090> approximately<00:02:21.630> the<00:02:21.750> same

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:22.100 
the same or approximately the same

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:24.920 
the same or approximately the same
therefore<00:02:23.100> we<00:02:24.030> can<00:02:24.180> go<00:02:24.270> out<00:02:24.330> into<00:02:24.480> any<00:02:24.630> runway

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
therefore we can go out into any runway

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.290 
therefore we can go out into any runway

distance<00:02:31.560> will<00:02:31.770> be<00:02:31.800> by<00:02:32.430> means<00:02:32.700> of<00:02:32.880> this<00:02:33.030> ratio
