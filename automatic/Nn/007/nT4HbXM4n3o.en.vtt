going<00:00:40.649> on<00:00:40.890> at<00:00:41.010> this<00:00:41.129> point<00:00:41.340> but<00:00:41.940> it<00:00:42.030> turns<00:00:42.270> out

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
going on at this point but it turns out

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.380 
going on at this point but it turns out
that<00:00:42.660> he's<00:00:42.930> actually<00:00:43.910> absorbed<00:00:44.910> some<00:00:45.149> of<00:00:45.270> this

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
that he's actually absorbed some of this

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.959 
that he's actually absorbed some of this
guy's<00:00:45.600> ability<00:00:45.960> to<00:00:46.710> control<00:00:47.039> smoke<00:00:47.399> and<00:00:47.760> we

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
guy's ability to control smoke and we

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.360 
guy's ability to control smoke and we
would<00:00:48.120> be<00:00:48.530> foolish<00:00:49.530> if<00:00:49.559> we<00:00:49.860> didn't<00:00:50.100> have<00:00:50.280> him

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
would be foolish if we didn't have him

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.700 
would be foolish if we didn't have him
encounter<00:00:50.850> you<00:00:51.360> know<00:00:51.480> another<00:00:51.930> conduit<00:00:52.410> along

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
encounter you know another conduit along

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.639 
encounter you know another conduit along
the<00:00:52.920> way<00:00:53.100> and<00:00:54.059> absorb<00:00:54.449> some<00:00:54.510> other<00:00:54.899> powers<00:00:55.379> but

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
the way and absorb some other powers but

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.000 
the way and absorb some other powers but
for<00:00:55.920> now<00:00:56.120> smoke<00:00:57.120> is<00:00:57.239> what<00:00:57.270> you<00:00:57.510> got<00:00:57.660> smoke<00:00:58.500> was

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
for now smoke is what you got smoke was

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.880 
for now smoke is what you got smoke was
a<00:00:59.039> really<00:00:59.760> good<00:00:59.969> challenge<00:01:00.270> it<00:01:00.750> is<00:01:01.020> more<00:01:01.379> fluid

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
a really good challenge it is more fluid

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.390 
a really good challenge it is more fluid
it<00:01:02.070> actually<00:01:03.350> there<00:01:04.350> has<00:01:04.559> to<00:01:04.589> be<00:01:04.860> this<00:01:05.040> sense

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
it actually there has to be this sense

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.370 
it actually there has to be this sense
that<00:01:05.519> this<00:01:05.820> is<00:01:05.970> something<00:01:06.330> that<00:01:06.360> even<00:01:07.229> when

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
that this is something that even when

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.710 
that this is something that even when
it's<00:01:07.560> like<00:01:07.860> geysers<00:01:08.850> of<00:01:09.090> smoke<00:01:09.479> that's

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
it's like geysers of smoke that's

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.440 
it's like geysers of smoke that's
pushing<00:01:10.020> an<00:01:10.439> APC<00:01:10.920> across<00:01:11.549> the<00:01:11.790> street<00:01:12.210> or

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
pushing an APC across the street or

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.630 
pushing an APC across the street or
across<00:01:12.600> the<00:01:12.869> block<00:01:13.290> it<00:01:13.650> still<00:01:14.159> has<00:01:14.340> to<00:01:14.460> feel

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
across the block it still has to feel

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.160 
across the block it still has to feel
like<00:01:14.790> it's<00:01:14.939> something<00:01:15.119> that's<00:01:15.270> flowing<00:01:16.020> more

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
like it's something that's flowing more

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.380 
like it's something that's flowing more
out<00:01:16.350> of<00:01:16.380> him<00:01:16.710> as<00:01:16.890> opposed<00:01:17.670> to<00:01:17.820> something<00:01:18.119> that

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
out of him as opposed to something that

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:19.760 
out of him as opposed to something that
he's<00:01:18.509> still<00:01:18.780> trying<00:01:19.080> to<00:01:19.140> keep<00:01:19.320> under<00:01:19.560> control

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
he's still trying to keep under control

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.030 
he's still trying to keep under control
so<00:01:20.729> a<00:01:20.759> lot<00:01:21.150> of<00:01:21.180> stuff<00:01:21.540> in<00:01:21.720> the<00:01:21.869> past<00:01:22.049> had<00:01:22.740> to<00:01:22.890> do

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
so a lot of stuff in the past had to do

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.990 
so a lot of stuff in the past had to do
with<00:01:23.280> get<00:01:24.150> really<00:01:24.619> contorted<00:01:25.619> hand<00:01:26.040> poses<00:01:26.580> and

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
with get really contorted hand poses and

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.940 
with get really contorted hand poses and
then<00:01:27.390> just<00:01:27.960> trying<00:01:28.170> to<00:01:28.290> keep<00:01:28.439> everything<00:01:28.680> in

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
then just trying to keep everything in

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.700 
then just trying to keep everything in
check<00:01:29.009> almost<00:01:29.880> like<00:01:30.000> a<00:01:30.030> photon<00:01:30.540> blaster<00:01:31.140> and

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
check almost like a photon blaster and

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.350 
check almost like a photon blaster and
this<00:01:31.860> time<00:01:32.040> around<00:01:32.159> with<00:01:32.369> smoke<00:01:32.729> it's<00:01:33.060> more

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
this time around with smoke it's more

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.109 
this time around with smoke it's more
about<00:01:33.570> how<00:01:34.079> does<00:01:34.229> it<00:01:34.350> come<00:01:34.890> out<00:01:34.950> and<00:01:35.340> then<00:01:35.909> from

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
about how does it come out and then from

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:37.850 
about how does it come out and then from
that<00:01:36.390> point<00:01:36.659> and<00:01:36.869> time<00:01:37.020> feel<00:01:37.350> strong<00:01:37.710> and

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
that point and time feel strong and

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.499 
that point and time feel strong and
usually<00:01:38.189> so<00:01:38.369> it's<00:01:38.520> more<00:01:38.670> about<00:01:38.850> like<00:01:39.030> reach

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
usually so it's more about like reach

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.020 
usually so it's more about like reach
out<00:01:39.780> grab<00:01:40.049> and<00:01:40.500> then<00:01:40.740> twist<00:01:41.189> and<00:01:41.340> turn<00:01:41.640> him<00:01:41.820> and

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
out grab and then twist and turn him and

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.840 
out grab and then twist and turn him and
move<00:01:42.270> with<00:01:42.509> it<00:01:42.950> well<00:01:43.950> Delson<00:01:44.310> smoke<00:01:44.610> power

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
move with it well Delson smoke power

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.120 
move with it well Delson smoke power
allows<00:01:45.810> him<00:01:46.079> to<00:01:46.110> move

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
allows him to move

they're<00:02:35.970> referring<00:02:36.300> to<00:02:36.360> something<00:02:36.510> else<00:02:36.750> but

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
they're referring to something else but

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.770 
they're referring to something else but
I<00:02:38.130> appeared<00:02:38.489> on<00:02:38.580> camera<00:02:38.790> at<00:02:39.180> some<00:02:39.360> point<00:02:39.540> and

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
I appeared on camera at some point and

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.140 
I appeared on camera at some point and
talked<00:02:40.260> about<00:02:40.590> 30<00:02:40.890> seconds<00:02:41.280> of<00:02:41.400> fun<00:02:41.610> and<00:02:41.940> I

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
talked about 30 seconds of fun and I

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.030 
talked about 30 seconds of fun and I
think<00:02:42.360> that's<00:02:42.510> become<00:02:42.900> kind<00:02:43.620> of<00:02:43.650> a<00:02:43.739> shorthand

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
think that's become kind of a shorthand

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.000 
think that's become kind of a shorthand
for<00:02:44.340> a<00:02:44.549> certain<00:02:45.000> style<00:02:45.480> of<00:02:45.690> game<00:02:45.959> where<00:02:46.530> you

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
for a certain style of game where you

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.820 
for a certain style of game where you
nail<00:02:48.000> simple<00:02:48.510> mechanics<00:02:49.019> that<00:02:49.500> can<00:02:49.709> be

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
nail simple mechanics that can be

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:51.890 
nail simple mechanics that can be
combined<00:02:50.250> in<00:02:50.580> lots<00:02:51.209> and<00:02:51.390> lots<00:02:51.510> of<00:02:51.600> different

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
combined in lots and lots of different

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.199 
combined in lots and lots of different
ways<00:02:52.049> and<00:02:52.350> I<00:02:53.160> think<00:02:53.459> that's<00:02:53.640> the<00:02:53.820> aesthetic

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
ways and I think that's the aesthetic

ways and I think that's the aesthetic
that<00:02:54.390> I'm<00:02:54.540> trying<00:02:54.840> to<00:02:54.930> bring<00:02:55.110> to<00:02:55.790> infamous

in<00:02:58.799> focus<00:02:59.370> tests<00:02:59.730> and<00:02:59.910> I'd<00:03:00.420> see<00:03:00.630> people<00:03:00.660> play

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
in focus tests and I'd see people play

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:02.930 
in focus tests and I'd see people play

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
natural and kind of expressed them away

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:42.649 
natural and kind of expressed them away
as

00:03:42.649 --> 00:03:42.659 
as

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:45.300 
as
for<00:03:43.659> us<00:03:43.750> we've<00:03:44.319> been<00:03:44.349> able<00:03:44.620> to<00:03:44.829> kind<00:03:45.069> of<00:03:45.129> like

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:45.310 
for us we've been able to kind of like

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:47.789 
for us we've been able to kind of like
get<00:03:46.090> the<00:03:46.269> best<00:03:46.510> of<00:03:46.689> both<00:03:46.840> worlds<00:03:47.349> because

00:03:47.789 --> 00:03:47.799 
get the best of both worlds because

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:50.339 
get the best of both worlds because
we're<00:03:47.980> taking<00:03:48.159> an<00:03:48.579> existing<00:03:49.450> universe<00:03:49.900> that

00:03:50.339 --> 00:03:50.349 
we're taking an existing universe that

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:52.020 
we're taking an existing universe that
we're<00:03:50.500> very<00:03:50.530> familiar<00:03:51.400> with<00:03:51.430> and<00:03:51.819> has<00:03:52.000> a

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.030 
we're very familiar with and has a

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:54.959 
we're very familiar with and has a
strong<00:03:52.719> backbone<00:03:53.349> to<00:03:53.859> it<00:03:53.890> and<00:03:54.189> we're

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:54.969 
strong backbone to it and we're

00:03:54.969 --> 00:03:57.449 
strong backbone to it and we're
exploring<00:03:55.870> a<00:03:56.200> different<00:03:56.230> facet<00:03:56.950> of<00:03:57.040> that<00:03:57.219> and

00:03:57.449 --> 00:03:57.459 
exploring a different facet of that and

00:03:57.459 --> 00:03:59.789 
exploring a different facet of that and
it's<00:03:58.090> been<00:03:58.299> great<00:03:58.719> it's<00:03:58.989> been<00:03:59.349> exhilarating

00:03:59.789 --> 00:03:59.799 
it's been great it's been exhilarating

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:02.069 
it's been great it's been exhilarating
because<00:04:00.340> it's<00:04:00.670> like<00:04:00.790> we<00:04:01.510> get<00:04:01.689> to<00:04:01.750> go<00:04:02.049> through

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:02.079 
because it's like we get to go through

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:03.929 
because it's like we get to go through
and<00:04:02.500> say<00:04:02.620> okay<00:04:02.650> here's<00:04:03.219> our<00:04:03.340> rules<00:04:03.639> that<00:04:03.819> we've

00:04:03.929 --> 00:04:03.939 
and say okay here's our rules that we've

00:04:03.939 --> 00:04:06.300 
and say okay here's our rules that we've
already<00:04:04.120> established<00:04:04.739> here's<00:04:05.739> what<00:04:05.920> the<00:04:06.069> game

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:06.310 
already established here's what the game

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:08.759 
already established here's what the game
is<00:04:06.639> like<00:04:06.849> and<00:04:07.120> everything<00:04:07.299> now<00:04:08.049> let's<00:04:08.290> think

00:04:08.759 --> 00:04:08.769 
is like and everything now let's think

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:11.910 
is like and everything now let's think
about<00:04:08.950> it<00:04:09.340> in<00:04:09.459> a<00:04:09.909> in<00:04:10.269> a<00:04:10.629> different<00:04:11.170> light<00:04:11.349> with

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:11.920 
about it in a in a different light with

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:14.339 
about it in a in a different light with
a<00:04:11.950> different<00:04:12.430> character<00:04:12.639> that<00:04:13.420> we<00:04:13.780> can<00:04:13.989> build

00:04:14.339 --> 00:04:14.349 
a different character that we can build

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:15.929 
a different character that we can build
from<00:04:14.590> the<00:04:14.739> ground<00:04:14.950> up<00:04:15.159> and<00:04:15.310> make<00:04:15.489> just<00:04:15.790> as

00:04:15.929 --> 00:04:15.939 
from the ground up and make just as

00:04:15.939 --> 00:04:18.689 
from the ground up and make just as
exciting<00:04:16.479> so<00:04:17.019> it's<00:04:17.169> very<00:04:17.349> much<00:04:17.500> sort<00:04:18.280> of<00:04:18.370> in

00:04:18.689 --> 00:04:18.699 
exciting so it's very much sort of in

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:21.839 
exciting so it's very much sort of in
the<00:04:19.120> same<00:04:19.359> fabric<00:04:19.959> of<00:04:20.440> those<00:04:20.799> games<00:04:21.099> but<00:04:21.669> it

00:04:21.839 --> 00:04:21.849 
the same fabric of those games but it

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:23.310 
the same fabric of those games but it
stands<00:04:22.180> on<00:04:22.360> its<00:04:22.419> own<00:04:22.690> I<00:04:22.750> mean<00:04:23.020> it's<00:04:23.229> a

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:23.320 
stands on its own I mean it's a

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:25.439 
stands on its own I mean it's a
continuation<00:04:23.830> of<00:04:24.280> the<00:04:24.430> universe<00:04:24.880> but<00:04:25.300> it's

00:04:25.439 --> 00:04:25.449 
continuation of the universe but it's

00:04:25.449 --> 00:04:27.089 
continuation of the universe but it's
really<00:04:25.720> a<00:04:25.750> new<00:04:25.960> window<00:04:26.289> into<00:04:26.590> it<00:04:26.710> it's<00:04:26.860> a<00:04:26.919> new

00:04:27.089 --> 00:04:27.099 
really a new window into it it's a new

00:04:27.099 --> 00:04:30.180 
really a new window into it it's a new
character<00:04:27.490> with<00:04:28.300> new<00:04:28.539> abilities<00:04:29.080> in<00:04:29.650> a<00:04:29.949> new

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:30.190 
character with new abilities in a new

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:32.010 
character with new abilities in a new
city<00:04:30.550> and<00:04:31.000> I<00:04:31.240> think<00:04:31.419> that<00:04:31.539> we<00:04:31.630> don't<00:04:31.750> want<00:04:31.960> to

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:32.020 
city and I think that we don't want to

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:34.469 
city and I think that we don't want to
get<00:04:32.110> wrapped<00:04:32.380> up<00:04:32.620> in<00:04:32.830> spending<00:04:33.669> the<00:04:34.060> first<00:04:34.270> 10

00:04:34.469 --> 00:04:34.479 
get wrapped up in spending the first 10

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:35.700 
get wrapped up in spending the first 10
minutes<00:04:34.570> of<00:04:34.780> the<00:04:34.870> game<00:04:34.900> explaining<00:04:35.560> to<00:04:35.650> you

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:35.710 
minutes of the game explaining to you
