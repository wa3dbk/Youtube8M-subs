00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:20.570 

so<00:00:17.250> again<00:00:17.520> a<00:00:17.550> nice<00:00:17.820> long<00:00:18.180> cast<00:00:18.830> with<00:00:19.830> minimal

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
so again a nice long cast with minimal

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.519 
so again a nice long cast with minimal
effort<00:00:20.789> it's<00:00:21.240> when<00:00:21.480> you<00:00:21.630> try<00:00:21.810> to<00:00:21.930> cast<00:00:22.199> hard

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
effort it's when you try to cast hard

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.890 
effort it's when you try to cast hard
that<00:00:22.710> you're<00:00:22.800> gonna<00:00:22.890> get<00:00:23.039> that<00:00:23.189> back<00:00:23.490> line<00:00:23.900> now

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
that you're gonna get that back line now

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.060 
that you're gonna get that back line now
you<00:00:25.170> saw<00:00:25.500> in<00:00:26.750> that<00:00:27.750> moment<00:00:28.019> what<00:00:28.500> I<00:00:28.529> did<00:00:28.830> is<00:00:28.980> I

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
you saw in that moment what I did is I

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.500 
you saw in that moment what I did is I
dropped<00:00:29.340> the<00:00:29.490> jig<00:00:29.730> down<00:00:29.910> and<00:00:30.119> what<00:00:30.210> that<00:00:30.359> does

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
dropped the jig down and what that does

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.290 
dropped the jig down and what that does
is<00:00:30.720> just<00:00:31.019> by<00:00:31.170> pulling<00:00:31.500> through<00:00:32.120> again<00:00:33.120> it's

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
is just by pulling through again it's

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.220 
is just by pulling through again it's
just<00:00:33.450> a<00:00:33.540> big<00:00:33.809> arc<00:00:35.329> okay<00:00:36.329> so<00:00:36.510> that<00:00:36.809> just<00:00:36.989> pulls

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
just a big arc okay so that just pulls

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.049 
just a big arc okay so that just pulls
it<00:00:37.350> through<00:00:37.410> real<00:00:37.770> easy<00:00:38.010> now<00:00:38.280> the<00:00:38.550> kayak

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
it through real easy now the kayak

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.660 
it through real easy now the kayak
things<00:00:39.300> are<00:00:39.450> a<00:00:39.480> little<00:00:39.600> bit<00:00:39.809> different<00:00:40.550> if<00:00:41.550> I

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
things are a little bit different if I

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.190 
things are a little bit different if I
was<00:00:41.790> to<00:00:41.850> drop<00:00:42.059> this<00:00:42.300> through<00:00:42.660> and<00:00:42.870> bring<00:00:43.050> this

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
was to drop this through and bring this

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.560 
was to drop this through and bring this
down<00:00:43.440> here<00:00:43.800> my<00:00:44.160> jig<00:00:44.430> catches<00:00:44.850> the<00:00:44.969> water<00:00:45.180> and

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
down here my jig catches the water and

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.630 
down here my jig catches the water and
as<00:00:45.960> I<00:00:46.079> go<00:00:46.230> to<00:00:46.289> throw<00:00:46.590> it<00:00:46.739> I<00:00:46.860> backlash<00:00:47.430> so<00:00:47.610> I

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
as I go to throw it I backlash so I

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.209 
as I go to throw it I backlash so I
generally<00:00:47.910> have<00:00:48.180> to<00:00:48.360> start<00:00:48.600> off<00:00:48.780> with<00:00:49.140> my<00:00:49.500> my

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
generally have to start off with my my

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.630 
generally have to start off with my my
lure<00:00:50.550> much<00:00:51.210> closer<00:00:51.660> to<00:00:52.020> my<00:00:52.140> rod<00:00:52.379> tip<00:00:52.410> so<00:00:53.280> when

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
lure much closer to my rod tip so when

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.209 
lure much closer to my rod tip so when
I'm<00:00:53.760> to<00:00:53.910> here<00:00:54.300> it's<00:00:54.539> not<00:00:55.010> actually<00:00:56.010> hitting

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
I'm to here it's not actually hitting

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.490 
I'm to here it's not actually hitting
the<00:00:56.340> water<00:00:56.610> cause<00:00:57.210> if<00:00:57.329> I<00:00:57.420> go<00:00:57.600> there<00:00:57.840> again<00:00:58.050> if<00:00:58.410> I

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
the water cause if I go there again if I

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.680 
the water cause if I go there again if I
go<00:00:58.680> and<00:00:58.770> pull<00:00:59.070> that's<00:00:59.850> going<00:01:00.090> to<00:01:00.149> pull<00:01:00.329> against

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
go and pull that's going to pull against

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.660 
go and pull that's going to pull against
the<00:01:00.780> reel<00:01:00.960> if<00:01:01.260> my<00:01:01.410> thumb<00:01:01.649> slips<00:01:02.070> I<00:01:02.340> can

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
the reel if my thumb slips I can

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.820 
the reel if my thumb slips I can
backlash<00:01:03.120> before<00:01:03.539> I<00:01:03.570> even<00:01:03.719> get<00:01:03.930> started<00:01:03.989> so

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
backlash before I even get started so

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.109 
backlash before I even get started so
when<00:01:04.949> you're<00:01:05.040> kayaking<00:01:05.369> you<00:01:05.580> generally<00:01:06.060> start

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
when you're kayaking you generally start

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:11.000 
when you're kayaking you generally start
a<00:01:06.570> little<00:01:07.020> bit<00:01:07.140> lower<00:01:09.439> but<00:01:10.439> you<00:01:10.530> can<00:01:10.650> still<00:01:10.860> get

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
a little bit lower but you can still get

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.370 
a little bit lower but you can still get
that<00:01:11.070> good<00:01:11.490> distance

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:12.380 
that good distance

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:14.420 
that good distance
now<00:01:13.380> one<00:01:13.619> thing<00:01:13.650> you<00:01:13.830> also<00:01:13.979> want<00:01:14.250> to<00:01:14.280> remember

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
now one thing you also want to remember

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.670 
now one thing you also want to remember
when<00:01:14.700> you're<00:01:14.820> in<00:01:14.909> a<00:01:15.000> kayak<00:01:15.210> is<00:01:15.630> a<00:01:15.869> lot<00:01:16.409> of<00:01:16.560> us

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
when you're in a kayak is a lot of us

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.429 
when you're in a kayak is a lot of us
will<00:01:16.950> have<00:01:17.600> got<00:01:18.600> the<00:01:18.689> seagull<00:01:18.990> chasing<00:01:19.350> my

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
will have got the seagull chasing my

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.429 
will have got the seagull chasing my
lure<00:01:19.650> a<00:01:20.610> lot<00:01:21.299> of<00:01:21.509> times<00:01:21.689> in<00:01:21.840> my<00:01:21.930> kayak<00:01:22.140> I'll

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
lure a lot of times in my kayak I'll

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.789 
lure a lot of times in my kayak I'll
have<00:01:22.820> extra<00:01:23.820> rod<00:01:24.030> holders<00:01:24.540> behind<00:01:24.720> me<00:01:25.259> all<00:01:25.590> the

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
have extra rod holders behind me all the

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:30.039 
have extra rod holders behind me all the
big<00:01:26.009> tank<00:01:26.310> behind<00:01:26.759> me<00:01:26.970> so<00:01:27.390> if<00:01:27.479> I<00:01:27.600> tap<00:01:27.659> this<00:01:28.350> way

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:30.049 
big tank behind me so if I tap this way

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:32.780 
big tank behind me so if I tap this way
the<00:01:31.049> chances<00:01:31.470> are<00:01:31.590> very<00:01:31.770> good<00:01:31.979> that<00:01:32.280> I'm<00:01:32.640> going

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
the chances are very good that I'm going

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.300 
the chances are very good that I'm going
to<00:01:32.850> catch<00:01:33.090> that<00:01:33.119> rod<00:01:33.750> behind<00:01:34.380> me<00:01:34.619> or<00:01:34.979> catch

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
to catch that rod behind me or catch

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.859 
to catch that rod behind me or catch
some<00:01:35.610> of<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:35.759> gear<00:01:35.970> behind<00:01:36.119> me<00:01:36.420> so<00:01:36.570> you<00:01:36.659> tend

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
some of the gear behind me so you tend

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.649 
some of the gear behind me so you tend
to<00:01:36.930> do<00:01:37.079> a<00:01:37.320> lot<00:01:37.890> more<00:01:37.920> awkward<00:01:38.729> typecast<00:01:39.299> in<00:01:39.570> a

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
to do a lot more awkward typecast in a

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.569 
to do a lot more awkward typecast in a
kayak<00:01:39.869> so<00:01:40.439> to<00:01:40.500> get<00:01:40.860> forward<00:01:41.189> rather<00:01:41.460> than

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
kayak so to get forward rather than

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:45.950 
kayak so to get forward rather than
casting<00:01:41.930> my<00:01:42.930> normal<00:01:43.439> this<00:01:43.920> way<00:01:44.509> I'll<00:01:45.509> do<00:01:45.780> more

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
casting my normal this way I'll do more

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.620 
casting my normal this way I'll do more
of<00:01:46.049> a<00:01:46.140> sidearm<00:01:46.439> but<00:01:47.310> you<00:01:47.460> can<00:01:47.610> see<00:01:47.850> even<00:01:48.390> with

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
of a sidearm but you can see even with

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.590 
of a sidearm but you can see even with
the<00:01:48.720> sidearm<00:01:49.020> I<00:01:49.619> still<00:01:50.130> get<00:01:50.310> that<00:01:50.340> rotation<00:01:50.729> of

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
the sidearm I still get that rotation of

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.840 
the sidearm I still get that rotation of
the<00:01:52.110> reel<00:01:52.380> to<00:01:52.979> the<00:01:53.130> bottom<00:01:53.460> position

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:55.850 
the reel to the bottom position

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.000 
the reel to the bottom position
it's<00:01:56.570> obviously<00:01:56.960> and<00:01:57.290> when<00:01:57.409> I'm<00:01:57.530> in<00:01:57.650> my<00:01:57.770> kayak

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:58.010 
it's obviously and when I'm in my kayak

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:01.120 
it's obviously and when I'm in my kayak
and<00:01:58.430> I<00:01:59.060> see<00:01:59.270> fish<00:01:59.479> boiling<00:01:59.960> off<00:02:00.110> to<00:02:00.260> my<00:02:00.409> right<00:02:00.740> I

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.130 
and I see fish boiling off to my right I

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.280 
and I see fish boiling off to my right I
can't<00:02:01.850> a<00:02:01.880> dupe<00:02:02.090> like<00:02:02.270> I<00:02:02.420> do<00:02:02.479> on<00:02:02.630> a<00:02:02.780> boat<00:02:03.050> and<00:02:03.200> go

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:03.290 
can't a dupe like I do on a boat and go

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:04.030 
can't a dupe like I do on a boat and go
like<00:02:03.500> this

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:04.040 
like this

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:07.090 
like this
and<00:02:04.520> turn<00:02:04.790> it<00:02:04.820> around<00:02:05.380> so<00:02:06.380> you<00:02:06.410> do<00:02:06.800> to<00:02:06.920> learn

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:07.100 
and turn it around so you do to learn

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.279 
and turn it around so you do to learn
again<00:02:07.430> to<00:02:07.610> castle<00:02:08.000> a<00:02:08.030> bit<00:02:08.149> more<00:02:08.300> awkwardly<00:02:08.780> and

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:09.289 
again to castle a bit more awkwardly and

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:12.870 
again to castle a bit more awkwardly and
so<00:02:10.070> I'll<00:02:10.190> maybe<00:02:10.399> just<00:02:11.120> do<00:02:11.270> a<00:02:11.300> backhand<00:02:11.630> flip

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
so I'll maybe just do a backhand flip

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.850 
so I'll maybe just do a backhand flip
now<00:02:13.880> you<00:02:13.970> can<00:02:14.180> see<00:02:14.360> my<00:02:14.660> rail<00:02:14.959> is<00:02:15.260> now<00:02:15.530> on<00:02:15.740> the

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
now you can see my rail is now on the

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.480 
now you can see my rail is now on the
topside<00:02:16.310> it's<00:02:16.580> not<00:02:16.730> the<00:02:16.910> ideal<00:02:17.750> position<00:02:18.490> but

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:19.490 
topside it's not the ideal position but

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:20.680 
topside it's not the ideal position but
that's<00:02:19.820> what<00:02:19.970> you<00:02:20.060> got<00:02:20.209> to<00:02:20.240> do<00:02:20.420> when<00:02:20.540> you're<00:02:20.660> in

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
that's what you got to do when you're in

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:22.030 
that's what you got to do when you're in
a<00:02:20.780> kayak<00:02:20.990> cuz<00:02:21.260> you<00:02:21.350> can't<00:02:21.560> turn<00:02:21.709> the<00:02:21.770> boat

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
a kayak cuz you can't turn the boat

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.990 
a kayak cuz you can't turn the boat
around<00:02:22.070> that<00:02:22.520> fast

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
around that fast

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000 
around that fast
it<00:02:23.390> just<00:02:23.630> takes<00:02:23.840> practice<00:02:24.110> practice<00:02:24.980> practice

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
it just takes practice practice practice

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.070 
it just takes practice practice practice
the<00:02:25.640> more<00:02:25.790> comfortable<00:02:26.060> you<00:02:26.420> get<00:02:26.600> with<00:02:26.780> one<00:02:26.930> of

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
the more comfortable you get with one of

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:28.660 
the more comfortable you get with one of
these<00:02:27.140> things<00:02:27.440> the<00:02:27.950> better<00:02:28.190> off<00:02:28.370> you're<00:02:28.580> going

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
these things the better off you're going

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:30.790 
these things the better off you're going
to<00:02:28.730> be<00:02:28.880> in<00:02:29.030> the<00:02:29.120> long<00:02:29.270> run<00:02:29.660> and<00:02:29.959> you're<00:02:30.470> really

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:30.800 
to be in the long run and you're really

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.530 
to be in the long run and you're really
going<00:02:30.980> to<00:02:31.040> appreciate<00:02:31.610> the<00:02:31.790> qualities<00:02:32.300> of<00:02:32.330> a

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
going to appreciate the qualities of a

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:34.600 
going to appreciate the qualities of a
baitcaster<00:02:32.780> over<00:02:33.530> using<00:02:33.830> that<00:02:33.950> spinning<00:02:34.430> reel

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
baitcaster over using that spinning reel

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:37.960 
baitcaster over using that spinning reel
on<00:02:34.880> distance<00:02:35.810> on<00:02:36.020> accuracy<00:02:36.860> I<00:02:37.310> mean<00:02:37.760> I'm

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:37.970 
on distance on accuracy I mean I'm

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:39.640 
on distance on accuracy I mean I'm
telling<00:02:38.120> when<00:02:38.360> we're<00:02:38.540> fishing<00:02:39.140> the<00:02:39.170> river<00:02:39.440> up

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
telling when we're fishing the river up

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:42.100 
telling when we're fishing the river up
in<00:02:39.800> Ottawa<00:02:39.980> I<00:02:40.430> could<00:02:40.970> toss<00:02:41.180> my<00:02:41.390> jig<00:02:41.630> as<00:02:41.750> hard<00:02:41.959> as

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
in Ottawa I could toss my jig as hard as

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:44.650 
in Ottawa I could toss my jig as hard as
I<00:02:42.230> could<00:02:42.290> and<00:02:42.860> then<00:02:43.790> if<00:02:43.940> I<00:02:44.030> was<00:02:44.150> coming<00:02:44.420> towards

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660 
I could and then if I was coming towards

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:46.660 
I could and then if I was coming towards
a<00:02:44.750> tree<00:02:44.989> or<00:02:45.170> an<00:02:45.230> overhang<00:02:45.650> just<00:02:46.100> put<00:02:46.310> my<00:02:46.459> thumb

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
a tree or an overhang just put my thumb

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:49.000 
a tree or an overhang just put my thumb
on<00:02:46.700> the<00:02:46.940> spool<00:02:47.209> stop<00:02:48.080> it<00:02:48.350> and<00:02:48.530> drop<00:02:48.769> it<00:02:48.980> right

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
on the spool stop it and drop it right

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.100 
on the spool stop it and drop it right
into<00:02:49.610> the<00:02:49.790> hole<00:02:50.000> that<00:02:50.209> I<00:02:50.269> want<00:02:50.600> so<00:02:51.019> you

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
into the hole that I want so you

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:52.660 
into the hole that I want so you
definitely<00:02:51.290> get<00:02:51.590> more<00:02:51.709> accuracy<00:02:52.220> with<00:02:52.459> a<00:02:52.519> bait

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:52.670 
definitely get more accuracy with a bait

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:54.460 
definitely get more accuracy with a bait
caster<00:02:52.880> than<00:02:53.300> a<00:02:53.360> spinning<00:02:53.690> reel<00:02:53.810> I<00:02:54.050> think<00:02:54.410> you

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 
caster than a spinning reel I think you

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:56.530 
caster than a spinning reel I think you
should<00:02:54.620> give<00:02:54.769> them<00:02:54.890> a<00:02:54.920> try<00:02:55.160> it's<00:02:55.820> really<00:02:56.450> the

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
should give them a try it's really the

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.180 
should give them a try it's really the
way<00:02:56.660> to<00:02:56.690> go<00:02:56.959> if<00:02:57.200> you<00:02:57.230> want<00:02:57.380> to<00:02:57.590> pull<00:02:57.739> on<00:02:57.920> the<00:02:58.010> big

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.190 
way to go if you want to pull on the big

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:00.790 
way to go if you want to pull on the big
fish

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:00.800
