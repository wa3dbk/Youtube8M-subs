00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
again I'm here with another lesson on

the<00:00:10.469> pentatonic<00:00:10.889> scales<00:00:11.370> in<00:00:11.759> this<00:00:12.509> lesson

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
the pentatonic scales in this lesson

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.379 
the pentatonic scales in this lesson
we're<00:00:13.139> going<00:00:13.170> to<00:00:13.469> cover<00:00:13.679> pattern<00:00:14.400> for<00:00:14.700> so

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
we're going to cover pattern for so

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:16.460 
we're going to cover pattern for so
hopefully<00:00:15.690> you've<00:00:15.839> learned<00:00:15.960> the<00:00:16.109> first<00:00:16.289> three

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
hopefully you've learned the first three

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.439 
hopefully you've learned the first three
patterns<00:00:16.680> and<00:00:17.100> if<00:00:17.730> you've<00:00:17.910> seen<00:00:18.090> those<00:00:18.270> other

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
patterns and if you've seen those other

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.599 
patterns and if you've seen those other
lessons<00:00:18.810> you<00:00:18.900> know<00:00:19.020> by<00:00:19.170> now<00:00:19.320> that<00:00:19.590> pattern<00:00:20.369> for

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
lessons you know by now that pattern for

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.939 
lessons you know by now that pattern for
is<00:00:20.880> going<00:00:21.060> to<00:00:21.150> pick<00:00:21.330> up<00:00:21.510> where<00:00:22.050> pattern<00:00:22.529> 3<00:00:22.740> left

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
is going to pick up where pattern 3 left

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.189 
is going to pick up where pattern 3 left
off<00:00:23.130> so<00:00:23.789> let's<00:00:23.970> zoom<00:00:24.210> in<00:00:24.359> and<00:00:24.660> take<00:00:24.900> a<00:00:24.930> look<00:00:25.019> at

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
off so let's zoom in and take a look at

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.880 
off so let's zoom in and take a look at
that<00:00:25.230> left<00:00:25.619> hand<00:00:27.349> okay<00:00:28.349> so<00:00:28.410> just<00:00:28.590> like<00:00:28.769> we've

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
that left hand okay so just like we've

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.330 
that left hand okay so just like we've
done<00:00:28.920> before<00:00:29.210> we'll<00:00:30.210> start<00:00:30.630> by<00:00:31.340> remembering

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
done before we'll start by remembering

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:33.590 
done before we'll start by remembering
where<00:00:32.489> we<00:00:32.579> left<00:00:32.700> off<00:00:32.910> on<00:00:32.969> the<00:00:33.270> previous
