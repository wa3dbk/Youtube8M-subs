00:00:00.069 --> 00:00:03.069
 34 days Michael Ballack enters the Bundesliga again 

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:08.019
 to enjoy animal beautiful girls but still for me 

00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:11.019
 long time and world 

00:00:11.539 --> 00:00:14.820
 now he has to try to play this again 

00:00:14.819 --> 00:00:17.499
 Of course a great feeling is its shape 

00:00:17.499 --> 00:00:18.800
 before the game 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.580
 The whole week Ballack had informed that he wanted from the beginning 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:23.499
 want to play 

00:00:23.499 --> 00:00:27.359
 but his supervisor his trainer Jupp Heynckes leaves him today first 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:28.999
 on the bench 

00:00:28.999 --> 00:00:33.290
 the good mood at first no top team unworthy therefore 

00:00:33.289 --> 00:00:36.289
 believes that the first chance is 24 minutes 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:41.960
 the Borussia and the typical pitch of a table last 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.910
 again nothing for leaf 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:47.470
 Nevertheless 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:51.420
 not that they do not score the optimal score again and that 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.280
 has to change 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.720
 the 37,000 spectators including Michael Ballack long before the break 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:59.100
 nothing exciting 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.820
 until this free kick 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:01.970
 for the Germans 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:05.410
 already finished 

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:09.470
 the 0 2 1 37 the minute beauty measured 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:14.890
 such free kicks has inherited pity now so scored also be his 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:17.890
 Father Miroslav Kadlec earlier in the Bundesliga 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.670
 and the hit destroys the balance the game Gladbach evening 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.820
 live unsettled and so will 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:27.520
 at that Leverkusen 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.180
 45 7 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:30.850
 now was fixed 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:32.350
 Gonzalo Castro 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:36.680
 Annette's 71 minor header goals will allow the bottom of the table this season 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.400
 practically every one 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:43.210
 is halftime in Gladbach Jupp Heynckes has Ballack middle that he continues 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:44.660
 must be patient 9 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:47.430
 not only came in 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.430
 every round of play I always want to play 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:54.000
 Arts is impatient towards ko-round 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.970
 even injury by then coming back relatively quickly well 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:00.010
 I only trained the lack of knowledge of the young in the settlement 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:02.330
 currently situation is needed 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:05.040
 8 56 minutes for the battered pull 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.320
 then comes Michael Ballack 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.400
 Gladbach now comes with more momentum with more courage demonstrated 

00:02:11.919 --> 00:02:14.919
 by Martin Stranzl 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:16.809
 the connection hit 

00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:20.659
 a very big moment of Martin Stranzl in which not much possible 

00:02:20.659 --> 00:02:21.489
 is 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:24.429
 the impossible is copied 

00:02:24.429 --> 00:02:27.429
 from despair 

00:02:31.719 --> 00:02:33.429
 and Michael Ballack 

00:02:33.429 --> 00:02:39.039
 the former patient immediately present a lot on the way he right on the ball a lot 

00:02:39.039 --> 00:02:41.129
 but 

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:43.499
 no penalty 

00:02:43.499 --> 00:02:48.459
 Gladbach funny so much that breaks out at Bayer briefly anarchy 

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:53.909
 to stop 5 for the opponent 

00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:55.519
 that was possible 

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:58.569
 Leverkusen exploded forward 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:02:59.829
 an attack 

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:00.959
 completed 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:03.959
 by Gonzalo Castro 

00:03:05.219 --> 00:03:08.680
 73 minutes the 1 to 3 the Borussia operated 

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:14.459
 Vienna at the pinball machine service to in the penalty area of â€‹â€‹the guests 

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:16.669
 Michael Ballack 

00:03:16.669 --> 00:03:19.309
 Ultimately, that's where our game starts 

00:03:19.309 --> 00:03:20.379
 that Castro 

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:23.379
 self-assured completed 

00:03:27.559 --> 00:03:31.989
 Bayer wins in gratitude to 1 with Michael Ballack and is now so 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:33.569
 in second 

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:36.849
 We must now refuel at home two months, a little hard Euro and out of the 

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:38.479
 1 1 in October will be too 

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:41.239
 refuel the upstairs percent earned and so to stand on the 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:43.599
 second place is not just proof 

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:44.680
 next week 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:46.039
 then it goes against 

00:03:46.039 --> 00:03:50.289
 against the opponent against whom Michael Ballack in the first leg then so difficult 

00:03:50.289 --> 00:03:50.689
 injured
