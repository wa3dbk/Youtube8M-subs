00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:17.950 

so<00:00:12.780> here<00:00:12.960> I've<00:00:13.080> opened<00:00:13.230> SketchBook<00:00:14.130> Pro<00:00:14.570> 2<00:00:15.570> and

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:17.960 
so here I've opened SketchBook Pro 2 and

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.840 
so here I've opened SketchBook Pro 2 and
we<00:00:18.960> have<00:00:19.080> our<00:00:19.230> brush<00:00:19.439> palette<00:00:19.680> here<00:00:20.250> layers

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
we have our brush palette here layers

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.720 
we have our brush palette here layers
and<00:00:21.359> you<00:00:21.570> know<00:00:21.660> the<00:00:21.960> typical<00:00:22.410> color<00:00:22.619> and<00:00:23.189> your

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
and you know the typical color and your

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.060 
and you know the typical color and your
brush<00:00:24.119> size<00:00:24.900> and<00:00:25.199> properties<00:00:26.180> tool<00:00:27.180> here

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:28.070 
brush size and properties tool here

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:31.640 
brush size and properties tool here
let's<00:00:29.070> go<00:00:29.369> and<00:00:29.609> set<00:00:30.300> up<00:00:30.330> our<00:00:30.570> canvas<00:00:30.990> size<00:00:31.199> this

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
let's go and set up our canvas size this

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.850 
let's go and set up our canvas size this
is<00:00:31.800> important<00:00:32.340> because<00:00:32.510> if<00:00:33.510> you're<00:00:33.840> using<00:00:34.530> a

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
is important because if you're using a

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.840 
is important because if you're using a
dimension<00:00:35.850> that's<00:00:36.000> really<00:00:36.420> small<00:00:37.100> then<00:00:38.100> your

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
dimension that's really small then your

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.569 
dimension that's really small then your
pixel<00:00:39.239> dimension<00:00:39.660> then<00:00:40.170> your<00:00:41.070> brush<00:00:41.430> strokes

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
pixel dimension then your brush strokes

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.639 
pixel dimension then your brush strokes
are<00:00:41.910> gonna<00:00:42.000> be<00:00:42.180> really<00:00:42.450> pixelated<00:00:42.809> so<00:00:43.379> I

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
are gonna be really pixelated so I

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.900 
are gonna be really pixelated so I
usually<00:00:44.010> go<00:00:44.430> to<00:00:45.559> 11<00:00:46.559> by<00:00:46.649> 17<00:00:47.070> like<00:00:47.399> a<00:00:47.489> tabloid

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
usually go to 11 by 17 like a tabloid

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.619 
usually go to 11 by 17 like a tabloid
format<00:00:48.270> and<00:00:49.100> this<00:00:50.100> gives<00:00:50.430> you<00:00:50.550> a<00:00:50.789> larger

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
format and this gives you a larger

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.799 
format and this gives you a larger
memory<00:00:52.010> size<00:00:53.010> but<00:00:53.489> your<00:00:53.699> image<00:00:54.120> will<00:00:54.449> be<00:00:54.570> a

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
memory size but your image will be a

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.860 
memory size but your image will be a
higher<00:00:55.110> quality<00:00:55.710> and<00:00:55.969> the<00:00:56.969> reason<00:00:57.239> I<00:00:57.300> use<00:00:57.329> 11

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
higher quality and the reason I use 11

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.680 
higher quality and the reason I use 11
by<00:00:57.960> 17<00:00:58.379> is<00:00:58.710> I'm<00:00:59.010> gonna<00:00:59.190> have<00:00:59.460> the<00:01:00.000> upper<00:01:00.449> and

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
by 17 is I'm gonna have the upper and

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.229 
by 17 is I'm gonna have the upper and
the<00:01:00.750> tooling<00:01:01.500> together<00:01:02.489> on<00:01:02.670> the<00:01:02.760> on<00:01:02.910> the<00:01:03.030> same

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
the tooling together on the on the same

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.109 
the tooling together on the on the same
page<00:01:03.570> so<00:01:03.930> I<00:01:04.199> need<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:04.470> extra<00:01:04.890> space<00:01:05.100> below<00:01:05.760> for

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
page so I need the extra space below for

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:11.420 
page so I need the extra space below for
the<00:01:06.240> tooling<00:01:07.250> so<00:01:08.250> in<00:01:08.520> Illustrator<00:01:10.220> let's<00:01:11.220> just

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
the tooling so in Illustrator let's just

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.789 
the tooling so in Illustrator let's just
jump<00:01:11.850> to<00:01:12.240> illustrator<00:01:12.840> really<00:01:13.170> quickly<00:01:13.560> and

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:15.799 

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:19.270 

here<00:01:16.799> we<00:01:16.950> have<00:01:17.159> last<00:01:17.939> dimensions<00:01:18.540> this<00:01:18.689> is

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:19.280 
here we have last dimensions this is

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:24.770 
here we have last dimensions this is
within<00:01:20.280> your<00:01:20.759> folder<00:01:21.740> for<00:01:22.740> kok<00:01:23.610> volume<00:01:23.970> 1-2

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
within your folder for kok volume 1-2

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.490 
within your folder for kok volume 1-2
and<00:01:25.220> this<00:01:26.220> will<00:01:26.430> have<00:01:26.869> your<00:01:27.869> like<00:01:28.470> a

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
and this will have your like a

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.090 
and this will have your like a
basketball<00:01:28.950> shoe<00:01:29.070> last<00:01:29.549> it<00:01:30.450> shows<00:01:31.100> some

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
basketball shoe last it shows some

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.679 
basketball shoe last it shows some
dimensions<00:01:32.670> this<00:01:32.820> is<00:01:32.880> one-to-one<00:01:33.630> scale<00:01:33.960> and

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:35.689 
dimensions this is one-to-one scale and

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:38.390 
dimensions this is one-to-one scale and
let's<00:01:36.689> zoom<00:01:36.750> in<00:01:37.079> here<00:01:37.380> and<00:01:37.860> you're<00:01:38.009> gonna<00:01:38.130> see

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
let's zoom in here and you're gonna see

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.940 
let's zoom in here and you're gonna see
I<00:01:38.700> kind<00:01:39.240> of<00:01:39.299> laid<00:01:39.509> out<00:01:39.540> some<00:01:40.079> specific<00:01:40.710> things

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
I kind of laid out some specific things

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.819 
I kind of laid out some specific things
to<00:01:41.070> kind<00:01:41.939> of<00:01:42.030> think<00:01:42.270> about<00:01:42.649> before<00:01:43.649> you<00:01:43.799> start

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
to kind of think about before you start

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.370 
to kind of think about before you start
sketching<00:01:44.220> a<00:01:44.460> basketball<00:01:44.939> shoe<00:01:44.970> so<00:01:45.509> your

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
sketching a basketball shoe so your

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.310 
sketching a basketball shoe so your
midsole<00:01:47.250> height<00:01:47.490> in<00:01:47.640> the<00:01:47.729> forefoot<00:01:48.180> you<00:01:49.170> want

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
midsole height in the forefoot you want

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.560 
midsole height in the forefoot you want
to<00:01:49.409> set<00:01:49.619> the<00:01:49.860> last<00:01:50.070> which<00:01:50.670> is<00:01:50.820> this<00:01:50.970> blue<00:01:51.299> shape

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
to set the last which is this blue shape

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.710 
to set the last which is this blue shape
here<00:01:51.930> you<00:01:52.829> want<00:01:53.009> to<00:01:53.070> set<00:01:53.220> this<00:01:53.369> up<00:01:53.430> with<00:01:54.180> a<00:01:54.210> ten

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
here you want to set this up with a ten

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.499 
here you want to set this up with a ten
millimeter<00:01:54.930> midsole<00:01:55.710> four<00:01:56.040> foot<00:01:56.310> and<00:01:56.549> a<00:01:57.180> 20

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
millimeter midsole four foot and a 20

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.899 
millimeter midsole four foot and a 20
millimeter<00:01:57.930> thickness<00:01:58.350> of<00:01:58.710> foam<00:01:58.920> in<00:01:59.280> the<00:01:59.670> heel

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
millimeter thickness of foam in the heel

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:03.340 
millimeter thickness of foam in the heel
that's<00:02:00.329> your<00:02:00.719> typical<00:02:01.399> heel<00:02:02.399> height

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.350 
that's your typical heel height

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:05.030 
that's your typical heel height
difference<00:02:04.350> from<00:02:04.500> the<00:02:04.619> yield<00:02:04.799> to<00:02:04.950> the

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
difference from the yield to the

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.819 
difference from the yield to the
forefoot<00:02:05.479> in<00:02:06.479> addition<00:02:06.960> to<00:02:07.110> that<00:02:07.320> from<00:02:07.680> this

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
forefoot in addition to that from this

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:10.669 
forefoot in addition to that from this
dotted<00:02:08.099> line<00:02:08.250> here<00:02:08.539> going<00:02:09.539> down<00:02:09.720> you<00:02:10.470> have

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
dotted line here going down you have

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:11.900 
dotted line here going down you have
your<00:02:10.920> rubber<00:02:11.069> thickness<00:02:11.610> and<00:02:11.790> that's

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
your rubber thickness and that's

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.580 
your rubber thickness and that's
typically<00:02:12.510> about<00:02:12.810> four<00:02:13.020> and<00:02:13.110> a<00:02:13.170> half

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
typically about four and a half

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.010 
typically about four and a half
meters<00:02:13.980> thick<00:02:14.280> and<00:02:14.610> obviously<00:02:15.360> it<00:02:15.480> tapers<00:02:15.870> as

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
meters thick and obviously it tapers as

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.190 
meters thick and obviously it tapers as
you<00:02:16.140> wrap<00:02:16.319> up<00:02:16.500> the<00:02:16.620> back<00:02:16.830> and<00:02:17.280> up<00:02:17.430> the<00:02:17.580> toe

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
you wrap up the back and up the toe

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.339 
you wrap up the back and up the toe
another<00:02:19.200> thing<00:02:19.440> to<00:02:19.560> consider<00:02:19.800> is<00:02:20.510> on<00:02:21.510> the<00:02:22.080> last

00:02:22.339 --> 00:02:22.349 
another thing to consider is on the last

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:25.580 
another thing to consider is on the last
I<00:02:22.860> offset<00:02:23.730> this<00:02:24.239> dotted<00:02:24.510> line<00:02:24.660> here<00:02:24.810> two

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
I offset this dotted line here two

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.940 
I offset this dotted line here two
millimeters<00:02:26.250> so<00:02:26.640> you<00:02:26.700> want<00:02:27.150> to<00:02:27.209> put<00:02:27.390> that<00:02:27.510> in

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
millimeters so you want to put that in

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.750 
millimeters so you want to put that in
just<00:02:28.950> for<00:02:29.250> some<00:02:29.819> material<00:02:30.300> thickness<00:02:30.510> and

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
just for some material thickness and

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.640 
just for some material thickness and
also<00:02:32.760> in<00:02:33.540> the<00:02:33.660> back<00:02:33.840> here<00:02:34.110> I<00:02:34.140> put<00:02:34.349> a<00:02:34.380> heel

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
also in the back here I put a heel

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.030 
also in the back here I put a heel

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
keep it from kind of lifting upward when

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:49.250 
keep it from kind of lifting upward when
you're<00:02:47.819> kind<00:02:48.030> of<00:02:48.090> going<00:02:48.750> through<00:02:48.900> your

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
lace holes for kind of a mid cut height

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:02.839 
lace holes for kind of a mid cut height
and<00:03:00.110> when<00:03:01.110> you<00:03:01.200> look<00:03:01.349> at<00:03:01.500> the<00:03:01.620> tooling<00:03:02.099> kind<00:03:02.760> of

00:03:02.839 --> 00:03:02.849 
and when you look at the tooling kind of

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:05.630 
and when you look at the tooling kind of
you<00:03:02.940> translate<00:03:03.510> these<00:03:03.720> lines<00:03:03.989> downward<00:03:04.640> the

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
you translate these lines downward the

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.780 
you translate these lines downward the
bottom<00:03:06.090> of<00:03:06.239> the<00:03:06.360> last<00:03:07.130> this<00:03:08.130> is<00:03:08.190> your<00:03:08.489> bottom

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
bottom of the last this is your bottom

last gauge is the is this inner line
here<00:03:11.970> what<00:03:12.930> I<00:03:12.959> did<00:03:13.200> was<00:03:13.410> I<00:03:13.590> added<00:03:13.830> the<00:03:14.370> typical

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
here what I did was I added the typical

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.949 
here what I did was I added the typical
flare<00:03:15.599> out<00:03:15.630> and<00:03:16.170> where<00:03:16.680> the<00:03:16.980> rubber<00:03:17.959> outer

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
flare out and where the rubber outer

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:22.099 
flare out and where the rubber outer
surface<00:03:19.709> would<00:03:19.890> be<00:03:20.000> so<00:03:21.000> you<00:03:21.630> know<00:03:21.750> typically

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:22.109 
surface would be so you know typically

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:24.080 
surface would be so you know typically
in<00:03:22.230> the<00:03:22.440> back<00:03:22.650> you<00:03:22.950> know<00:03:23.040> from<00:03:23.250> your<00:03:23.370> last<00:03:23.640> it

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
in the back you know from your last it

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:27.289 
in the back you know from your last it
kind<00:03:24.329> of<00:03:24.390> flares<00:03:24.720> out<00:03:25.140> and<00:03:25.489> you<00:03:26.489> end<00:03:26.970> up<00:03:27.120> with

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:27.299 
kind of flares out and you end up with

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:30.680 
kind of flares out and you end up with
this<00:03:27.480> this<00:03:28.140> outer<00:03:28.500> shape<00:03:29.269> over<00:03:30.269> here<00:03:30.450> is<00:03:30.569> your

this this outer shape over here is your

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:33.020 
this this outer shape over here is your
outrigger<00:03:31.200> you<00:03:31.829> have<00:03:31.920> your<00:03:32.069> four<00:03:32.310> foot<00:03:32.519> main

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
outrigger you have your four foot main

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:35.599 
outrigger you have your four foot main

pivot point kind of like when you you

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.910 
pivot point kind of like when you you
know<00:03:40.950> cut<00:03:41.370> and<00:03:41.660> turn<00:03:42.660> you're<00:03:43.440> kind<00:03:43.620> of<00:03:43.650> going

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 
know cut and turn you're kind of going

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:45.229 
know cut and turn you're kind of going
on<00:03:44.010> the<00:03:44.100> ball<00:03:44.310> of<00:03:44.489> your<00:03:44.609> foot<00:03:44.819> and<00:03:44.880> that's<00:03:45.060> kind

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:45.239 
on the ball of your foot and that's kind

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:47.990 
on the ball of your foot and that's kind
of<00:03:45.299> in<00:03:45.389> this<00:03:45.510> zone<00:03:45.750> and<00:03:46.019> lastly<00:03:46.889> an<00:03:47.130> internal

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
of in this zone and lastly an internal

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.500 
of in this zone and lastly an internal
shank<00:03:48.410> typically<00:03:49.410> this<00:03:49.620> is<00:03:49.880> about<00:03:50.880> one<00:03:51.299> and<00:03:51.420> a

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.510 
shank typically this is about one and a

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:54.319 
shank typically this is about one and a
half<00:03:51.540> to<00:03:51.840> two<00:03:52.019> millimeters<00:03:52.260> and<00:03:52.910> you<00:03:53.910> can<00:03:54.090> play

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:54.329 
half to two millimeters and you can play

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:56.960 
half to two millimeters and you can play
around<00:03:54.480> with<00:03:54.840> the<00:03:55.290> the<00:03:55.590> shape<00:03:55.859> of<00:03:56.130> this<00:03:56.370> but

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
around with the the shape of this but

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:59.539 
around with the the shape of this but
this<00:03:57.030> is<00:03:57.090> a<00:03:57.239> standard<00:03:57.900> rectangular<00:03:58.799> form<00:03:59.220> and

00:03:59.539 --> 00:03:59.549 
this is a standard rectangular form and

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:01.610 
this is a standard rectangular form and
this<00:04:00.180> is<00:04:00.299> roughly<00:04:00.630> the<00:04:00.810> placement<00:04:01.380> you<00:04:01.470> want

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:01.620 
this is roughly the placement you want

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:05.569 
this is roughly the placement you want
to<00:04:01.709> kind<00:04:01.950> of<00:04:02.100> keep<00:04:02.970> that<00:04:03.269> area<00:04:03.660> from<00:04:04.579> flexing

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:05.579 
to kind of keep that area from flexing

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:08.569 
to kind of keep that area from flexing
especially<00:04:06.510> if<00:04:06.660> you<00:04:06.810> scoop<00:04:07.260> out<00:04:07.500> the<00:04:07.859> arch

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:08.579 
especially if you scoop out the arch

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:12.620 
especially if you scoop out the arch
area<00:04:09.060> and<00:04:09.329> you<00:04:09.959> remove<00:04:10.709> foam<00:04:11.069> this<00:04:11.880> shank

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:12.630 
area and you remove foam this shank

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:14.750 
area and you remove foam this shank
component<00:04:13.590> just<00:04:13.950> really<00:04:14.250> helps<00:04:14.579> with

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:14.760 
component just really helps with

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:18.379 
component just really helps with
stabilization<00:04:15.299> of<00:04:15.750> that<00:04:15.900> arch<00:04:17.000> so<00:04:18.000> let's<00:04:18.239> go

00:04:18.379 --> 00:04:18.389 
stabilization of that arch so let's go

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:20.569 
stabilization of that arch so let's go
into<00:04:18.660> SketchBook<00:04:19.139> Pro<00:04:19.169> back<00:04:19.739> in<00:04:20.010> and<00:04:20.280> what

00:04:20.569 --> 00:04:20.579 
into SketchBook Pro back in and what

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:23.930 
into SketchBook Pro back in and what
I've<00:04:20.700> done<00:04:20.880> is<00:04:21.090> I've<00:04:21.299> imported<00:04:22.140> this<00:04:22.940> file

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 
I've done is I've imported this file

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:25.940 
I've done is I've imported this file
into<00:04:24.270> SketchBook<00:04:24.780> Pro<00:04:24.810> so<00:04:25.289> we<00:04:25.409> have<00:04:25.560> this<00:04:25.680> file

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:25.950 
into SketchBook Pro so we have this file

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:27.140 
into SketchBook Pro so we have this file
here<00:04:26.280> and<00:04:26.520> I'm<00:04:26.640> going<00:04:26.789> to<00:04:26.820> just

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
here and I'm going to just

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:30.590 
here and I'm going to just
turn<00:04:27.600> down<00:04:27.750> the<00:04:28.020> transparency<00:04:28.889> a<00:04:28.919> little<00:04:29.600> and

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:30.600 
turn down the transparency a little and

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:36.290 
turn down the transparency a little and
I<00:04:31.500> already<00:04:31.950> went<00:04:32.370> ahead<00:04:32.490> and<00:04:33.000> sketched<00:04:35.300> kind

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:36.300 
I already went ahead and sketched kind

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:40.520 
I already went ahead and sketched kind
of<00:04:36.389> a<00:04:36.450> design<00:04:36.840> here<00:04:37.260> and<00:04:39.020> what<00:04:40.020> I<00:04:40.050> wanted<00:04:40.410> to

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:40.530 
of a design here and what I wanted to

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:44.320 
of a design here and what I wanted to
show<00:04:40.830> you<00:04:41.060> is<00:04:42.060> how<00:04:42.510> I<00:04:42.540> overlay<00:04:43.230> this<00:04:43.620> design

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:44.330 
show you is how I overlay this design

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:48.430 
show you is how I overlay this design
onto<00:04:45.330> the<00:04:45.660> last<00:04:45.870> now<00:04:46.860> when<00:04:47.580> you're<00:04:47.730> sketching

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:48.440 
onto the last now when you're sketching

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:52.250 
onto the last now when you're sketching
you<00:04:49.440> want<00:04:49.800> to<00:04:50.090> take<00:04:51.090> some<00:04:51.300> liberties<00:04:51.720> in<00:04:52.020> your

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:52.260 
you want to take some liberties in your

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:56.180 
you want to take some liberties in your
your<00:04:52.889> styling<00:04:53.460> so<00:04:54.200> you<00:04:55.200> don't<00:04:55.380> have<00:04:55.650> to<00:04:55.860> follow

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:56.190 
your styling so you don't have to follow

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:00.110 
your styling so you don't have to follow
the<00:04:56.850> outer<00:04:57.320> shape<00:04:58.320> of<00:04:58.500> this<00:04:58.620> last<00:04:59.120> because

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:00.120 
the outer shape of this last because

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:02.120 
the outer shape of this last because
when<00:05:00.450> this<00:05:00.600> upper<00:05:01.139> is<00:05:01.200> assembled

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:02.130 
when this upper is assembled

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:04.670 
when this upper is assembled
you<00:05:02.250> know<00:05:02.340> things<00:05:02.639> will<00:05:02.850> kick<00:05:03.180> in<00:05:03.479> and<00:05:03.780> you

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:04.680 
you know things will kick in and you

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:06.320 
you know things will kick in and you
just<00:05:04.710> want<00:05:05.220> your<00:05:05.340> sketch<00:05:05.700> to<00:05:05.880> have<00:05:05.970> a<00:05:06.000> little

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:06.330 
just want your sketch to have a little

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:10.370 
just want your sketch to have a little
bit<00:05:06.450> more<00:05:06.630> speed<00:05:07.139> and<00:05:08.479> sexiness<00:05:09.479> to<00:05:09.660> it<00:05:09.690> so<00:05:10.080> if

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:10.380 
bit more speed and sexiness to it so if

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:13.400 
bit more speed and sexiness to it so if
I<00:05:10.650> drew<00:05:11.220> long<00:05:12.150> you<00:05:12.450> know<00:05:12.570> if<00:05:12.690> I<00:05:12.840> drew<00:05:13.139> this

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:13.410 
I drew long you know if I drew this

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:16.190 
I drew long you know if I drew this
section<00:05:13.889> here<00:05:14.070> this<00:05:14.220> outer<00:05:14.520> line<00:05:14.880> of<00:05:14.910> the<00:05:15.780> heel

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:16.200 
section here this outer line of the heel

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:18.590 
section here this outer line of the heel
all<00:05:16.470> the<00:05:16.530> way<00:05:16.770> to<00:05:16.919> where<00:05:17.310> the<00:05:17.460> last<00:05:17.669> was<00:05:17.970> it

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:18.600 
all the way to where the last was it

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:21.140 
all the way to where the last was it
just<00:05:18.840> wouldn't<00:05:19.139> look<00:05:19.350> a<00:05:19.710> hundred<00:05:20.669> percent

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:21.150 
just wouldn't look a hundred percent

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:24.440 
just wouldn't look a hundred percent
right<00:05:21.389> it<00:05:21.660> would<00:05:22.169> be<00:05:22.440> correct<00:05:23.370> but<00:05:23.820> it<00:05:24.210> just

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:24.450 
right it would be correct but it just

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:28.100 
right it would be correct but it just
won't<00:05:24.990> look<00:05:25.320> correct<00:05:25.830> in<00:05:26.820> your<00:05:26.880> sketch<00:05:27.330> but

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:28.110 
won't look correct in your sketch but

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:29.719 
won't look correct in your sketch but
the<00:05:28.260> parts<00:05:28.560> that<00:05:28.590> you<00:05:28.740> do<00:05:28.979> want<00:05:29.220> to<00:05:29.400> maintain

00:05:29.719 --> 00:05:29.729 
the parts that you do want to maintain

00:05:29.729 --> 00:05:32.360 
the parts that you do want to maintain
and<00:05:30.389> not<00:05:30.900> really<00:05:31.229> deviate<00:05:31.710> from<00:05:31.740> is<00:05:32.190> the

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:32.370 
and not really deviate from is the

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:35.510 
and not really deviate from is the
bottom<00:05:32.789> of<00:05:32.880> the<00:05:33.030> last<00:05:33.860> so<00:05:34.860> you<00:05:34.919> really<00:05:35.250> want<00:05:35.430> to

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:35.520 
bottom of the last so you really want to

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:37.960 
bottom of the last so you really want to
make<00:05:35.669> sure<00:05:35.729> that<00:05:36.120> you<00:05:36.240> keep<00:05:36.570> the<00:05:36.870> foam

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:37.970 
make sure that you keep the foam

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:40.909 
make sure that you keep the foam
thicknesses<00:05:38.970> and<00:05:39.390> your<00:05:39.990> your<00:05:40.410> outsole

00:05:40.909 --> 00:05:40.919 
thicknesses and your your outsole

00:05:40.919 --> 00:05:45.190 
thicknesses and your your outsole
thicknesses<00:05:41.820> true<00:05:42.630> to<00:05:43.070> to<00:05:44.070> the<00:05:44.190> tooling

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:45.200 
thicknesses true to to the tooling

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:47.420 
thicknesses true to to the tooling
dimensions<00:05:46.200> and<00:05:46.440> this<00:05:46.680> is<00:05:46.830> important<00:05:47.370> because

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:47.430 
dimensions and this is important because

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:51.050 
dimensions and this is important because
once<00:05:48.240> you<00:05:48.419> do<00:05:48.690> this<00:05:48.840> sketch<00:05:49.260> and<00:05:49.640> you<00:05:50.640> actually

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:51.060 
once you do this sketch and you actually

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:54.170 
once you do this sketch and you actually
go<00:05:51.240> into<00:05:51.450> a<00:05:51.600> tech<00:05:51.930> pack<00:05:52.610> you<00:05:53.610> don't<00:05:53.850> have<00:05:54.030> to

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:54.180 
go into a tech pack you don't have to

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:57.050 
go into a tech pack you don't have to
redraw<00:05:54.690> in<00:05:55.320> the<00:05:55.800> correct<00:05:56.100> proportions<00:05:56.280> you've

00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:57.060 
redraw in the correct proportions you've

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:58.550 
redraw in the correct proportions you've
already<00:05:57.300> started<00:05:57.780> with<00:05:58.050> those<00:05:58.200> correct

00:05:58.550 --> 00:05:58.560 
already started with those correct

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:00.140 
already started with those correct
proportions<00:05:59.130> so<00:05:59.250> a<00:05:59.370> lot<00:05:59.550> of<00:05:59.669> designers

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:00.150 
proportions so a lot of designers

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:03.200 
proportions so a lot of designers
they'll<00:06:00.360> they'll<00:06:00.750> freehand<00:06:01.380> this<00:06:01.470> and<00:06:02.210> you

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:03.210 
they'll they'll freehand this and you

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:07.659 
they'll they'll freehand this and you
know<00:06:03.330> they're<00:06:03.660> they're<00:06:04.080> heel<00:06:04.500> is<00:06:04.770> kicked<00:06:05.960> off

00:06:07.659 --> 00:06:07.669 
know they're they're heel is kicked off

00:06:07.669 --> 00:06:11.540 
know they're they're heel is kicked off
in<00:06:08.669> you<00:06:09.150> know<00:06:09.270> in<00:06:09.479> this<00:06:09.690> direction<00:06:09.930> and<00:06:10.710> it's

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:11.550 
in you know in this direction and it's

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:15.620 
in you know in this direction and it's
it's<00:06:11.970> it's<00:06:12.720> too<00:06:13.080> small<00:06:13.560> and<00:06:14.210> the<00:06:15.210> forefoot

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:15.630 
it's it's too small and the forefoot

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:17.690 
it's it's too small and the forefoot
comes<00:06:15.900> way<00:06:16.200> out<00:06:16.440> and<00:06:16.770> it's<00:06:16.950> just<00:06:17.280> it's<00:06:17.610> just

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:17.700 
comes way out and it's just it's just

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:22.040 
comes way out and it's just it's just
misaligned<00:06:18.510> and<00:06:19.639> you'd<00:06:20.639> have<00:06:20.820> to<00:06:21.050> reposition

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:22.050 
misaligned and you'd have to reposition

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:23.990 
misaligned and you'd have to reposition
and<00:06:22.680> reap<00:06:22.860> rapport<00:06:23.280> ssin<00:06:23.460> everything<00:06:23.880> and

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:24.000 
and reap rapport ssin everything and

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.230 
and reap rapport ssin everything and
it's<00:06:24.090> just<00:06:24.150> a<00:06:24.419> lot<00:06:24.630> of<00:06:24.690> wasted<00:06:25.200> time<00:06:25.260> so<00:06:25.919> a<00:06:26.240> way

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:27.240 
it's just a lot of wasted time so a way

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:29.990 
it's just a lot of wasted time so a way
to<00:06:27.270> eliminate<00:06:28.169> that<00:06:28.350> waste<00:06:28.919> of<00:06:29.220> time<00:06:29.490> is<00:06:29.760> just

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:30.000 
to eliminate that waste of time is just

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.270 
to eliminate that waste of time is just
start<00:06:30.330> drawing<00:06:30.690> on<00:06:31.050> the<00:06:31.260> correct<00:06:31.590> proportions

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:32.280 
start drawing on the correct proportions

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:38.000 
start drawing on the correct proportions
so<00:06:34.849> this<00:06:35.849> is<00:06:36.180> all<00:06:36.390> included<00:06:37.140> in<00:06:37.500> the<00:06:37.890> video

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:38.010 
so this is all included in the video

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:40.150 
so this is all included in the video
files<00:06:38.610> so<00:06:39.390> just<00:06:39.630> if<00:06:39.870> you

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:40.160 
files so just if you

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:42.340 
files so just if you
start<00:06:40.490> with<00:06:40.640> this<00:06:40.850> before<00:06:41.300> you<00:06:41.480> start

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:42.350 
start with this before you start

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:44.800 
start with this before you start
sketching<00:06:42.650> and<00:06:43.070> use<00:06:43.190> as<00:06:43.370> a<00:06:43.400> underlay<00:06:43.970> that's

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:44.810 
sketching and use as a underlay that's

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:47.170 
sketching and use as a underlay that's
typically<00:06:45.440> what<00:06:45.650> I<00:06:45.710> do<00:06:45.860> it<00:06:46.460> just<00:06:46.700> gives<00:06:47.000> you<00:06:47.090> a

00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:47.180 
typically what I do it just gives you a

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:51.010 
typically what I do it just gives you a
more<00:06:47.360> accurate<00:06:48.190> representation<00:06:49.190> so<00:06:50.020> another

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:51.020 
more accurate representation so another

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:53.140 
more accurate representation so another
thing<00:06:51.260> to<00:06:51.350> look<00:06:51.500> at<00:06:51.680> is<00:06:51.920> here<00:06:52.220> on<00:06:52.370> my<00:06:52.400> upper<00:06:52.880> I

00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:53.150 
thing to look at is here on my upper I

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:55.660 
thing to look at is here on my upper I
have<00:06:53.930> my<00:06:54.140> lace<00:06:54.380> lace<00:06:54.830> holes<00:06:55.130> and<00:06:55.460> you<00:06:55.520> don't

00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:55.670 
have my lace lace holes and you don't

00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:57.910 
have my lace lace holes and you don't
have<00:06:55.850> to<00:06:56.120> conform<00:06:56.900> to<00:06:56.990> where<00:06:57.200> these<00:06:57.350> positions

00:06:57.910 --> 00:06:57.920 
have to conform to where these positions

00:06:57.920 --> 00:06:59.830 
have to conform to where these positions
and<00:06:58.130> these<00:06:58.220> locations<00:06:58.820> are<00:06:59.000> this<00:06:59.180> was<00:06:59.420> just<00:06:59.720> a

00:06:59.830 --> 00:06:59.840 
and these locations are this was just a

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:03.430 
and these locations are this was just a
quick<00:07:00.460> you<00:07:01.460> know<00:07:01.580> setup<00:07:02.110> you<00:07:03.110> know<00:07:03.200> here<00:07:03.410> we

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:03.440 
quick you know setup you know here we

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:06.430
