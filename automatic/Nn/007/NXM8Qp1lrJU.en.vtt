when<00:01:48.930> I<00:01:48.960> first<00:01:49.470> started<00:01:50.009> playing<00:01:50.189> it<00:01:50.579> it<00:01:50.820> kind

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
when I first started playing it it kind

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.969 
when I first started playing it it kind
of<00:01:51.570> felt<00:01:51.840> a<00:01:51.990> little<00:01:52.229> bit<00:01:52.590> like<00:01:52.890> the<00:01:53.130> Duke<00:01:53.399> Nukem

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:54.979 
of felt a little bit like the Duke Nukem

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:58.249 
of felt a little bit like the Duke Nukem
multiplayer<00:01:55.979> yes<00:01:56.399> I<00:01:56.729> know<00:01:56.939> such<00:01:57.659> blasphemy

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
multiplayer yes I know such blasphemy

00:01:58.259 --> 00:01:59.569 
multiplayer yes I know such blasphemy
should<00:01:58.439> never<00:01:58.590> be<00:01:58.740> spoken<00:01:58.890> on<00:01:59.280> these<00:01:59.399> airwaves

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
should never be spoken on these airwaves

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:02.240 
should never be spoken on these airwaves
but<00:02:00.030> that<00:02:00.990> was<00:02:01.110> my<00:02:01.229> initial<00:02:01.469> thought<00:02:01.979> when<00:02:02.189> I

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
but that was my initial thought when I

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.850 
but that was my initial thought when I
started<00:02:02.729> kind<00:02:03.000> of<00:02:03.030> like<00:02:03.290> multiplayer<00:02:04.290> was<00:02:04.740> an

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
started kind of like multiplayer was an

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.190 
started kind of like multiplayer was an
afterthought<00:02:05.369> but<00:02:05.640> then<00:02:06.329> kind<00:02:06.630> of<00:02:06.689> got<00:02:06.899> into

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
afterthought but then kind of got into

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.839 
afterthought but then kind of got into
it<00:02:07.229> and<00:02:07.409> it<00:02:07.530> was<00:02:07.860> a<00:02:07.920> little<00:02:08.340> bit<00:02:08.489> more

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
it and it was a little bit more

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:11.479 
it and it was a little bit more
comfortable<00:02:09.239> as<00:02:09.599> we<00:02:09.750> got<00:02:09.899> any<00:02:10.020> within<00:02:10.349> and<00:02:10.649> it

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
comfortable as we got any within and it

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:12.860 
comfortable as we got any within and it
it<00:02:11.730> just<00:02:11.790> kind<00:02:12.150> of<00:02:12.209> felt<00:02:12.390> like<00:02:12.420> I<00:02:12.569> just<00:02:12.660> need<00:02:12.840> to

dolphin diving over the over that wall

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:36.530 
dolphin diving over the over that wall
there<00:02:35.130> looked<00:02:35.580> at<00:02:35.730> dude<00:02:35.880> bullet<00:02:36.210> time<00:02:36.390> the

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
there looked at dude bullet time the

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.960 
there looked at dude bullet time the
shit<00:02:36.780> out<00:02:36.930> of<00:02:36.960> me<00:02:37.080> right<00:02:37.230> there<00:02:37.790> see<00:02:38.790> I'm

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
shit out of me right there see I'm

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.890 
shit out of me right there see I'm
trying<00:02:39.150> to<00:02:39.300> shoot<00:02:39.480> him<00:02:39.660> and<00:02:39.870> he<00:02:40.080> kills<00:02:40.350> me<00:02:40.530> dead

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:41.900 
trying to shoot him and he kills me dead

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.510 
trying to shoot him and he kills me dead
so<00:02:42.900> it<00:02:43.080> just<00:02:43.110> takes<00:02:43.560> some<00:02:43.920> getting<00:02:44.190> used<00:02:44.220> to

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:44.520 
so it just takes some getting used to

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:47.180 
so it just takes some getting used to
the<00:02:45.150> killcam<00:02:45.660> Zorro<00:02:46.170> that<00:02:46.350> what<00:02:46.500> the<00:02:46.710> US<00:02:46.860> he

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:03.600 
don't take cover there is a cover system

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.200 
don't take cover there is a cover system
in<00:03:03.870> here<00:03:04.200> I<00:03:04.350> didn't<00:03:05.160> take<00:03:05.280> it<00:03:05.340> some<00:03:05.790> people<00:03:06.090> are

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
running assault rifles some people are

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:10.550 
running assault rifles some people are
running<00:03:08.040> submachine<00:03:08.760> guns<00:03:09.140> i'm<00:03:10.140> running<00:03:10.500> a

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
running submachine guns i'm running a

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.280 
running submachine guns i'm running a
shotgun<00:03:11.130> and<00:03:11.400> a<00:03:11.880> pistol<00:03:11.940> so<00:03:12.720> i'm<00:03:12.840> not<00:03:13.020> really

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
shotgun and a pistol so i'm not really

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:16.310 
shotgun and a pistol so i'm not really
sure<00:03:13.940> if<00:03:14.940> that<00:03:15.240> was<00:03:15.390> the<00:03:15.540> smartest<00:03:15.900> move<00:03:16.140> I

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:16.320 
sure if that was the smartest move I

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:17.780 
sure if that was the smartest move I
thought<00:03:16.560> maybe<00:03:16.830> it<00:03:17.040> would<00:03:17.100> be<00:03:17.160> okay<00:03:17.340> because

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
thought maybe it would be okay because

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:20.570 
thought maybe it would be okay because
it<00:03:18.060> was<00:03:18.210> a<00:03:18.680> the<00:03:19.680> shotgun<00:03:20.130> and<00:03:20.250> stuff<00:03:20.430> was

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:20.580 
it was a the shotgun and stuff was

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:22.280 
it was a the shotgun and stuff was
pretty<00:03:20.730> good<00:03:21.030> and<00:03:21.300> they<00:03:21.420> in<00:03:21.630> the<00:03:21.900> single

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
pretty good and they in the single

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:25.550 
pretty good and they in the single
player<00:03:22.380> in<00:03:22.590> the<00:03:22.650> campaign<00:03:23.810> there<00:03:24.810> I<00:03:25.110> meant<00:03:25.470> to

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
player in the campaign there I meant to

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:28.730 
player in the campaign there I meant to

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
shotgun like that which okay whatever i

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.850 
shotgun like that which okay whatever i
guess<00:03:47.310> that's<00:03:47.610> somewhat<00:03:48.420> realistic<00:03:48.960> but<00:03:49.500> it's

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:49.860 
guess that's somewhat realistic but it's

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:51.620 
guess that's somewhat realistic but it's
just<00:03:50.220> kind<00:03:50.460> of<00:03:50.520> odd<00:03:50.760> that<00:03:51.060> that's<00:03:51.300> how<00:03:51.480> they

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:51.630 
just kind of odd that that's how they

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:55.880 
just kind of odd that that's how they
would<00:03:51.750> choose<00:03:52.410> to<00:03:52.850> to<00:03:53.850> show<00:03:54.120> that<00:03:54.440> me<00:03:55.440> that<00:03:55.620> see

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:55.890 
would choose to to show that me that see

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:57.410 
would choose to to show that me that see
I'm<00:03:55.980> trying<00:03:56.160> to<00:03:56.340> aim<00:03:56.520> and<00:03:56.730> you<00:03:56.850> I<00:03:57.180> don't<00:03:57.360> know

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:57.420 
I'm trying to aim and you I don't know

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:59.210 
I'm trying to aim and you I don't know
how<00:03:57.630> it<00:03:57.930> decides<00:03:58.290> who<00:03:58.470> gets<00:03:58.590> to<00:03:58.800> do<00:03:58.890> bullet

00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.220 
how it decides who gets to do bullet

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:01.460 
how it decides who gets to do bullet
time<00:03:59.430> but<00:04:00.180> uh<00:04:00.300> it<00:04:00.570> was<00:04:00.750> definitely<00:04:00.990> not<00:04:01.290> me

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
time but uh it was definitely not me

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:03.770 
time but uh it was definitely not me
getting<00:04:01.800> to<00:04:01.920> do<00:04:02.010> bullet<00:04:02.340> time<00:04:02.520> let's<00:04:03.390> see<00:04:03.600> he's

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
getting to do bullet time let's see he's

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:05.120 
getting to do bullet time let's see he's
rocking<00:04:04.110> an<00:04:04.200> assault<00:04:04.530> rifle<00:04:04.590> he<00:04:04.950> just

original response so you can see this

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:57.420 
original response so you can see this
map<00:04:55.480> is<00:04:55.510> really<00:04:55.870> tight<00:04:56.080> seeing<00:04:57.010> this<00:04:57.100> shotgun
