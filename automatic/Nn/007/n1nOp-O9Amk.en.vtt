hi everyone its Luke here from US Coast
again<00:00:10.040> a<00:00:10.879> few<00:00:11.809> people<00:00:12.170> have<00:00:12.289> been<00:00:12.699> wanting<00:00:13.699> to

again a few people have been wanting to
know<00:00:14.240> how<00:00:14.869> to<00:00:14.929> create<00:00:15.440> new<00:00:16.009> images<00:00:16.990> for<00:00:17.990> the<00:00:18.079> V

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:18.230 
know how to create new images for the V

know how to create new images for the V
room<00:00:18.439> library<00:00:19.189> and<00:00:20.500> I've<00:00:21.500> got<00:00:21.680> the<00:00:21.770> demo<00:00:22.210> one

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:23.210 
room library and I've got the demo one

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:25.569 
room library and I've got the demo one
of<00:00:23.300> the<00:00:23.360> demo<00:00:23.630> images<00:00:24.020> here<00:00:24.230> and<00:00:24.439> all<00:00:25.250> it<00:00:25.400> is<00:00:25.520> is

00:00:25.569 --> 00:00:25.579 
of the demo images here and all it is is

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:29.620 
of the demo images here and all it is is
a<00:00:25.820> six<00:00:26.179> by<00:00:27.140> one<00:00:27.170> as<00:00:27.769> in<00:00:28.099> this<00:00:28.340> six<00:00:28.970> squares<00:00:29.330> that

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:29.630 
a six by one as in this six squares that

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:31.960 
a six by one as in this six squares that
you<00:00:29.689> can<00:00:29.869> see<00:00:30.019> here<00:00:30.289> each<00:00:30.529> square<00:00:30.949> has<00:00:31.640> a<00:00:31.670> side

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:31.970 
you can see here each square has a side

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:35.740 
you can see here each square has a side
of<00:00:32.000> the<00:00:32.710> the<00:00:33.710> room<00:00:34.309> on<00:00:34.460> it<00:00:34.610> so<00:00:34.879> we've<00:00:34.970> got<00:00:35.089> the

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:35.750 
of the the room on it so we've got the

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:38.320 
of the the room on it so we've got the
left<00:00:35.900> wall<00:00:36.140> here<00:00:36.530> the<00:00:37.040> back<00:00:37.250> wall<00:00:37.489> right<00:00:38.089> wall

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:38.330 
left wall here the back wall right wall

left wall here the back wall right wall
ceiling<00:00:39.079> floor<00:00:39.949> and<00:00:40.510> the<00:00:41.510> front<00:00:41.809> all<00:00:41.989> in<00:00:42.769> this

00:00:42.969 --> 00:00:42.979 
ceiling floor and the front all in this

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:45.160 
ceiling floor and the front all in this
case<00:00:43.190> I've<00:00:43.339> just<00:00:43.460> duplicated<00:00:44.119> this<00:00:44.930> one

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:45.170 
case I've just duplicated this one

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:46.899 
case I've just duplicated this one
because<00:00:45.650> this<00:00:45.769> was<00:00:45.949> taken<00:00:46.280> from<00:00:46.400> an<00:00:46.580> actual

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:46.909 
because this was taken from an actual

00:00:46.909 --> 00:00:51.280 
because this was taken from an actual
image<00:00:47.420> on<00:00:48.199> a<00:00:48.260> small<00:00:48.710> ball<00:00:48.949> bearing<00:00:50.290> some

people<00:00:51.559> have<00:00:51.650> wanted<00:00:51.799> to<00:00:51.979> know<00:00:52.070> how<00:00:52.309> to<00:00:52.369> do<00:00:52.610> how

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:53.210 
people have wanted to know how to do how

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:54.939 
people have wanted to know how to do how
to<00:00:53.239> sort<00:00:53.540> of<00:00:53.570> create<00:00:53.750> their<00:00:53.989> own<00:00:54.229> using<00:00:54.710> so

00:00:54.939 --> 00:00:54.949 
to sort of create their own using so

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:57.130 
to sort of create their own using so
Lightwave<00:00:55.580> interiors<00:00:56.269> of<00:00:56.449> scenes<00:00:56.989> that

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:57.140 
Lightwave interiors of scenes that

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.799 
Lightwave interiors of scenes that
they've<00:00:57.409> already<00:00:57.589> got<00:00:58.269> so<00:00:59.269> I've<00:00:59.360> just<00:00:59.540> spent<00:00:59.689> a

00:00:59.799 --> 00:00:59.809 
they've already got so I've just spent a

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:01.359 
they've already got so I've just spent a
few<00:00:59.989> minutes<00:01:00.320> to<00:01:00.589> try<00:01:00.739> and<00:01:00.890> figure<00:01:01.010> out<00:01:01.129> a<00:01:01.280> way

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:01.369 
few minutes to try and figure out a way

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:02.770 
few minutes to try and figure out a way
to<00:01:01.519> do<00:01:01.790> that<00:01:01.970> and<00:01:02.119> I've<00:01:02.239> come<00:01:02.479> up<00:01:02.600> with<00:01:02.629> a

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:02.780 
to do that and I've come up with a

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:07.030 
to do that and I've come up with a
method<00:01:04.900> that<00:01:05.900> I'll<00:01:06.049> just<00:01:06.290> take<00:01:06.830> you<00:01:07.010> through

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:07.040 
method that I'll just take you through

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.770 
method that I'll just take you through
now<00:01:07.720> now<00:01:08.720> we've<00:01:09.020> got<00:01:09.200> the<00:01:09.290> actual<00:01:09.790> is<00:01:10.790> here's

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:11.780 
now now we've got the actual is here's

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.890 
now now we've got the actual is here's
my<00:01:11.930> sort<00:01:12.200> of<00:01:12.259> test<00:01:12.619> room<00:01:12.910> here<00:01:13.910> it's<00:01:14.210> just<00:01:14.810> a

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:14.900 
my sort of test room here it's just a

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:18.040 
my sort of test room here it's just a
simple<00:01:16.030> simple<00:01:17.030> box<00:01:17.270> more<00:01:17.540> or<00:01:17.660> less<00:01:17.750> it's<00:01:17.930> not

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:18.050 
simple simple box more or less it's not

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:21.400 
simple simple box more or less it's not
quite<00:01:18.290> square<00:01:19.480> but<00:01:20.480> that<00:01:20.630> doesn't<00:01:21.260> actually

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:21.410 
quite square but that doesn't actually

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:24.670 
quite square but that doesn't actually
matter<00:01:21.800> and<00:01:22.810> on<00:01:23.810> the<00:01:23.990> next<00:01:24.320> layer

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:24.680 
matter and on the next layer

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:30.690 
matter and on the next layer
I've<00:01:25.580> got<00:01:28.330> essentially<00:01:29.330> the<00:01:29.450> same<00:01:29.630> geometry

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:30.700 
I've got essentially the same geometry

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:34.360 
I've got essentially the same geometry
but<00:01:31.700> ever<00:01:32.210> so<00:01:32.540> slightly<00:01:32.870> larger<00:01:33.500> because<00:01:34.190> I'm

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:34.370 
but ever so slightly larger because I'm

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:36.399 
but ever so slightly larger because I'm
going<00:01:34.520> to<00:01:34.580> use<00:01:34.760> this<00:01:34.909> as<00:01:35.090> the<00:01:35.120> camera<00:01:35.990> lens<00:01:36.170> in

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:36.409 
going to use this as the camera lens in

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:39.910 
going to use this as the camera lens in
the<00:01:36.500> advanced<00:01:36.920> camera<00:01:37.130> to<00:01:37.520> shoot<00:01:37.730> rays<00:01:38.060> and<00:01:38.920> on

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
the advanced camera to shoot rays and on

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.340 
the advanced camera to shoot rays and on
this<00:01:40.100> third<00:01:40.540> layer<00:01:41.540> I've<00:01:41.780> just<00:01:41.930> got<00:01:42.110> a<00:01:42.140> few

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:42.350 
this third layer I've just got a few

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:46.570 
this third layer I've just got a few
objects<00:01:42.979> to<00:01:43.130> scatter<00:01:43.490> into<00:01:43.729> the<00:01:43.940> room<00:01:45.400> so<00:01:46.400> if<00:01:46.490> I

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:46.580 
objects to scatter into the room so if I

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:48.969 
objects to scatter into the room so if I
switch<00:01:46.729> to<00:01:46.850> layout<00:01:47.240> the<00:01:48.110> scenes<00:01:48.440> already<00:01:48.620> done

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:48.979 
switch to layout the scenes already done

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:57.770 
switch to layout the scenes already done
in<00:01:49.159> here

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.450 

okay

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:01.460 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.680 

you<00:02:02.030> see<00:02:02.240> I've<00:02:02.360> already<00:02:02.600> set<00:02:02.810> things<00:02:03.049> up

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:04.690 
you see I've already set things up

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:08.260 
you see I've already set things up
advanced<00:02:05.690> camera<00:02:06.110> properties<00:02:06.619> oh<00:02:07.209> yeah<00:02:08.209> I

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:08.270 
advanced camera properties oh yeah I

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:13.270 
advanced camera properties oh yeah I
should<00:02:08.300> also<00:02:08.630> say<00:02:09.459> excuse<00:02:10.459> me<00:02:10.490> I<00:02:12.130> thought<00:02:13.130> the

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
should also say excuse me I thought the

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:14.770 
should also say excuse me I thought the
camera<00:02:13.459> lens

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
camera lens

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:22.600 
camera lens
I've<00:02:15.770> UV<00:02:16.340> mapped<00:02:16.580> it<00:02:18.970> yeah<00:02:19.970> you<00:02:20.390> can<00:02:20.569> see<00:02:21.610> I've

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
I've UV mapped it yeah you can see I've

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:25.110 
I've UV mapped it yeah you can see I've
made<00:02:22.880> a<00:02:22.910> u<00:02:23.150> it<00:02:23.300> just<00:02:23.480> a<00:02:23.569> simple<00:02:23.750> Atlas<00:02:24.200> UV<00:02:24.590> map

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
made a u it just a simple Atlas UV map

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:30.370 
made a u it just a simple Atlas UV map
these<00:02:26.120> quads<00:02:28.480> now<00:02:29.480> what<00:02:29.660> you<00:02:29.750> can<00:02:29.900> do<00:02:30.020> is<00:02:30.170> if

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.380 
these quads now what you can do is if

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:31.840 
these quads now what you can do is if
your<00:02:30.500> room's<00:02:30.739> a<00:02:30.830> lot<00:02:30.980> more<00:02:31.130> complicated<00:02:31.430> say

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:31.850 
your room's a lot more complicated say

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:33.309 
your room's a lot more complicated say
this<00:02:32.030> is<00:02:32.150> full<00:02:32.390> of<00:02:32.510> like<00:02:32.660> intricate<00:02:33.170> geometry

00:02:33.309 --> 00:02:33.319 
this is full of like intricate geometry

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:37.120 
this is full of like intricate geometry
just<00:02:34.310> create<00:02:34.880> a<00:02:34.940> bounding<00:02:35.420> box<00:02:35.690> and<00:02:36.019> then<00:02:36.470> UV

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.130 
just create a bounding box and then UV

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:40.530

that<00:03:34.930> you<00:03:34.990> can<00:03:35.200> tell<00:03:35.740> what's<00:03:35.980> what<00:03:36.300> and<00:03:37.300> I've

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:37.600 
that you can tell what's what and I've

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:42.710 
that you can tell what's what and I've
also<00:03:37.750> put<00:03:37.990> a<00:03:38.050> light<00:03:38.320> up<00:03:38.710> in<00:03:38.920> the<00:03:40.170> center<00:03:41.170> here

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
also put a light up in the center here

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:47.580 
also put a light up in the center here
to<00:03:43.720> illuminate<00:03:44.230> things<00:03:44.970> anyway<00:03:46.410> here's<00:03:47.410> what

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:47.590 
to illuminate things anyway here's what

to illuminate things anyway here's what
we<00:03:47.710> end<00:03:47.830> up<00:03:47.980> with<00:03:49.290> you<00:03:50.290> can<00:03:50.470> see<00:03:50.650> quite<00:03:50.980> simply

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340 
we end up with you can see quite simply

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:59.340 
we end up with you can see quite simply
it's<00:03:51.490> our<00:03:52.530> UV<00:03:53.530> map<00:03:53.740> here<00:03:54.010> and<00:03:58.110> the<00:03:59.110> Rays<00:03:59.320> are

00:03:59.340 --> 00:03:59.350 
it's our UV map here and the Rays are

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:06.050 
it's our UV map here and the Rays are
being<00:03:59.710> fired<00:04:00.040> out<00:04:03.120> sort<00:04:04.120> of<00:04:04.180> orthographically

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
being fired out sort of orthographically

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:13.110 
being fired out sort of orthographically
from<00:04:07.060> our<00:04:07.380> camera<00:04:08.380> lens<00:04:08.850> which<00:04:09.850> is<00:04:10.090> this<00:04:12.120> this

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:13.120 
from our camera lens which is this this

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:16.680 
from our camera lens which is this this
geometry<00:04:13.510> here<00:04:15.090> so<00:04:16.090> they're<00:04:16.239> fired<00:04:16.450> out

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:16.690 
geometry here so they're fired out

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:20.150 
geometry here so they're fired out
pretty<00:04:17.620> much<00:04:17.770> in<00:04:17.920> a<00:04:17.980> straight<00:04:18.010> line<00:04:18.630> and

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:20.160 
pretty much in a straight line and

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:23.220 
pretty much in a straight line and
they'll<00:04:21.360> intercept<00:04:22.360> your<00:04:22.570> actual<00:04:22.990> room

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:23.230 
they'll intercept your actual room

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:25.350 
they'll intercept your actual room
geometry<00:04:23.800> and<00:04:24.070> render<00:04:24.400> that<00:04:24.550> out<00:04:24.580> to<00:04:24.910> the<00:04:25.030> UV

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:25.360 
geometry and render that out to the UV

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:28.400 
geometry and render that out to the UV
map<00:04:25.540> so<00:04:26.500> then<00:04:26.590> obviously<00:04:26.770> just<00:04:27.010> save<00:04:27.460> that<00:04:27.490> to

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:28.410 
map so then obviously just save that to

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:39.409 
map so then obviously just save that to
whatever<00:04:29.410> not<00:04:30.010> to<00:04:30.130> save<00:04:30.340> it<00:04:30.490> as<00:04:30.550> a<00:04:30.580> JPEG

00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:39.419 

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:48.899 

and<00:04:40.419> then<00:04:40.870> you<00:04:41.139> hop<00:04:41.409> open<00:04:41.740> to<00:04:42.300> Photoshop<00:04:47.909> once

00:04:48.899 --> 00:04:48.909 
and then you hop open to Photoshop once

00:04:48.909 --> 00:04:50.939 
and then you hop open to Photoshop once
you're<00:04:49.060> in<00:04:49.150> Photoshop<00:04:49.750> all<00:04:50.020> you<00:04:50.319> then<00:04:50.560> have<00:04:50.800> to

00:04:50.939 --> 00:04:50.949 
you're in Photoshop all you then have to

00:04:50.949 --> 00:04:55.770 
you're in Photoshop all you then have to
do<00:04:51.099> is<00:04:51.340> to<00:04:51.520> take<00:04:51.699> these<00:04:52.060> items<00:04:54.120> and<00:04:55.120> basically

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:55.780 
do is to take these items and basically

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:59.429 
do is to take these items and basically
put<00:04:56.080> them<00:04:56.229> in<00:04:56.409> this<00:04:57.419> six<00:04:58.419> by<00:04:58.599> one<00:04:58.629> format<00:04:59.229> so

00:04:59.429 --> 00:04:59.439 
put them in this six by one format so

00:04:59.439 --> 00:05:02.339 
put them in this six by one format so
you've<00:04:59.590> got<00:04:59.740> six<00:04:59.979> squares<00:05:00.840> this<00:05:01.840> image<00:05:02.110> can<00:05:02.259> be

00:05:02.339 --> 00:05:02.349 
you've got six squares this image can be

00:05:02.349 --> 00:05:05.850 
you've got six squares this image can be
any<00:05:02.500> size<00:05:02.800> by<00:05:03.250> the<00:05:03.310> way<00:05:03.810> so<00:05:04.810> if<00:05:05.409> you<00:05:05.620> want<00:05:05.770> to

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:05.860 
any size by the way so if you want to

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:10.950 
any size by the way so if you want to
make<00:05:05.979> your<00:05:06.689> your<00:05:07.689> baked<00:05:08.490> image<00:05:09.659> very<00:05:10.659> large

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:10.960 
make your your baked image very large

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:12.869 
make your your baked image very large
you<00:05:11.710> can<00:05:11.919> make<00:05:12.099> it<00:05:12.250> as<00:05:12.310> large<00:05:12.460> as<00:05:12.699> you'd<00:05:12.849> like

00:05:12.869 --> 00:05:12.879 
you can make it as large as you'd like

00:05:12.879 --> 00:05:15.420 
you can make it as large as you'd like
as<00:05:13.240> large<00:05:13.569> as<00:05:13.779> you<00:05:13.900> need<00:05:14.139> just<00:05:14.830> as<00:05:15.039> long<00:05:15.250> as

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:15.430 
as large as you need just as long as

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:21.529 
as large as you need just as long as
it's<00:05:15.840> six<00:05:16.840> times<00:05:17.050> long<00:05:17.849> as<00:05:18.849> it<00:05:19.090> is

00:05:21.529 --> 00:05:21.539 

00:05:21.539 --> 00:05:25.050 

hai-yah<00:05:22.539> and<00:05:22.779> that<00:05:22.900> pretty<00:05:23.199> much<00:05:23.759> covers<00:05:24.759> that

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:25.060 
hai-yah and that pretty much covers that

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:28.560 
hai-yah and that pretty much covers that
