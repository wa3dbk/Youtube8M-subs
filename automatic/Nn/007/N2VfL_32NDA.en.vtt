really<00:00:12.349> just<00:00:12.620> air<00:00:13.510> it<00:00:14.510> goes<00:00:14.719> a<00:00:14.750> long<00:00:15.049> level<00:00:15.530> and

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:15.740 
really just air it goes a long level and

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:18.880 
really just air it goes a long level and
then<00:00:15.830> it<00:00:15.980> zooms<00:00:16.360> up<00:00:17.410> would<00:00:18.410> it<00:00:18.500> be<00:00:18.590> kind<00:00:18.740> of

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:18.890 
then it zooms up would it be kind of

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:23.409 
then it zooms up would it be kind of
cool<00:00:19.130> if<00:00:19.340> we<00:00:19.369> could<00:00:21.550> make<00:00:22.550> that<00:00:22.730> molding<00:00:23.119> curve

00:00:23.409 --> 00:00:23.419 
cool if we could make that molding curve

00:00:23.419 --> 00:00:27.630 
cool if we could make that molding curve
instead<00:00:24.189> let's<00:00:25.189> think<00:00:25.369> about<00:00:25.520> how<00:00:25.640> we<00:00:25.820> do<00:00:26.090> that

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:27.640 
instead let's think about how we do that

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.249 
instead let's think about how we do that
first<00:00:28.640> of<00:00:28.820> all<00:00:28.939> I'm<00:00:29.599> going<00:00:29.750> to<00:00:29.809> get<00:00:29.960> a<00:00:29.989> piece<00:00:30.230> of

00:00:30.249 --> 00:00:30.259 
first of all I'm going to get a piece of

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:36.100 
first of all I'm going to get a piece of
wood<00:00:30.790> and<00:00:31.790> I'm<00:00:32.390> going<00:00:32.570> to<00:00:32.599> cut<00:00:32.809> it<00:00:32.930> to<00:00:34.989> set<00:00:35.989> the

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:36.110 
wood and I'm going to cut it to set the

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:37.780 
wood and I'm going to cut it to set the
saw<00:00:36.290> on<00:00:36.320> fifty<00:00:36.860> three<00:00:37.100> and<00:00:37.129> cut<00:00:37.399> it<00:00:37.550> because<00:00:37.700> I

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:37.790 
saw on fifty three and cut it because I

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:54.370 
saw on fifty three and cut it because I
know<00:00:37.850> that<00:00:38.090> will<00:00:38.210> fit<00:00:38.360> right<00:00:38.540> in<00:00:38.660> there

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:54.380 

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:57.050 

I'm<00:00:55.380> going<00:00:55.530> to<00:00:55.590> duplicate<00:00:56.040> actual<00:00:56.520> job<00:00:56.790> site

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:57.060 
I'm going to duplicate actual job site

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:00.170 
I'm going to duplicate actual job site
conditions<00:00:57.570> here<00:00:57.810> and<00:00:57.930> a<00:00:58.460> big<00:00:59.460> pile<00:00:59.640> of<00:00:59.670> scraps

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
conditions here and a big pile of scraps

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:07.680 
conditions here and a big pile of scraps
everywhere

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:07.690 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:09.960 

I<00:01:07.810> usually<00:01:08.590> carry<00:01:08.860> a<00:01:09.010> little<00:01:09.310> notebook<00:01:09.580> with

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:09.970 
I usually carry a little notebook with

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:13.050 
I usually carry a little notebook with
me<00:01:10.000> like<00:01:10.750> a<00:01:10.800> composition<00:01:11.800> book<00:01:11.980> and<00:01:12.250> I<00:01:12.310> write

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:13.060 
me like a composition book and I write

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:14.640 
me like a composition book and I write
these<00:01:13.240> different<00:01:13.630> dimensions<00:01:14.050> down<00:01:14.260> and<00:01:14.530> edit

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:14.650 
these different dimensions down and edit

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:17.490 
these different dimensions down and edit
or<00:01:14.740> otherwise<00:01:15.010> I'll<00:01:15.220> forget<00:01:15.250> them<00:01:15.610> you<00:01:16.500> know

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:17.500 
or otherwise I'll forget them you know

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.110 
or otherwise I'll forget them you know
they<00:01:17.680> say<00:01:17.890> about<00:01:17.980> dimensions<00:01:18.700> is<00:01:18.850> you're<00:01:19.000> not

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:19.120 
they say about dimensions is you're not

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:20.490 
they say about dimensions is you're not
supposed<00:01:19.450> to<00:01:19.600> remember<00:01:19.840> him<00:01:20.080> you're<00:01:20.260> supposed

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:20.500 
supposed to remember him you're supposed

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:37.170 
supposed to remember him you're supposed
to<00:01:20.560> forget<00:01:20.890> them<00:01:21.010> infinity<00:01:21.430> economy<00:01:36.180> you'll

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:37.180 
to forget them infinity economy you'll

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:47.120 
to forget them infinity economy you'll
see<00:01:37.330> what<00:01:37.480> I'm<00:01:37.570> getting<00:01:37.720> at<00:01:37.930> in<00:01:38.050> a<00:01:38.110> moment<00:01:38.410> here

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.130 

so<00:01:48.130> isn't<00:01:48.610> quite<00:01:49.060> long<00:01:49.360> enough<00:01:49.390> to<00:01:49.780> cut<00:01:49.960> this

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:50.140 
so isn't quite long enough to cut this

00:01:50.140 --> 00:02:04.170 
so isn't quite long enough to cut this
whole<00:01:51.180> crosscut<00:01:52.180> of<00:01:52.210> this<00:01:53.310> one<00:01:54.310> by<00:01:54.490> ten<00:02:03.180> okay

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:04.180 
whole crosscut of this one by ten okay

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:09.210 
whole crosscut of this one by ten okay
so<00:02:04.240> this

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:09.220 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:12.270 

peace<00:02:10.090> will<00:02:10.300> go<00:02:10.450> right<00:02:10.630> in<00:02:10.840> there<00:02:11.050> now<00:02:11.860> I<00:02:11.890> want

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
peace will go right in there now I want

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:17.850 
peace will go right in there now I want
to<00:02:12.370> cut<00:02:12.520> it<00:02:12.550> to<00:02:12.790> a<00:02:12.820> curve<00:02:16.290> well<00:02:17.290> I<00:02:17.320> want<00:02:17.680> as<00:02:17.830> big

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
to cut it to a curve well I want as big

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:22.110 
to cut it to a curve well I want as big
a<00:02:18.220> curve<00:02:18.580> as<00:02:18.790> I<00:02:18.940> can<00:02:19.980> because<00:02:20.980> I<00:02:21.400> don't<00:02:21.730> make<00:02:22.060> a

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
a curve as I can because I don't make a

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.910 
a curve as I can because I don't make a
little<00:02:22.330> tight<00:02:22.540> curve<00:02:22.810> I<00:02:23.110> have<00:02:23.320> a<00:02:23.560> pair<00:02:23.890> of

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
little tight curve I have a pair of

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.530 
little tight curve I have a pair of
dividers<00:02:24.070> and<00:02:24.580> I<00:02:24.670> could<00:02:24.820> cuddle<00:02:25.000> turn<00:02:25.510> a

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
dividers and I could cuddle turn a

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.810 
dividers and I could cuddle turn a
little<00:02:25.690> coast<00:02:26.020> short<00:02:26.380> curve<00:02:26.580> but<00:02:27.580> I'm<00:02:27.670> gonna

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:27.820 
little coast short curve but I'm gonna

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:29.370 
little coast short curve but I'm gonna
have<00:02:27.940> a<00:02:27.970> hard<00:02:28.150> time<00:02:28.210> bending<00:02:28.750> a<00:02:28.810> molding<00:02:29.170> into

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380 
have a hard time bending a molding into

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:31.440 
have a hard time bending a molding into
a<00:02:29.410> tight<00:02:29.680> radius<00:02:29.890> I<00:02:30.310> want<00:02:30.940> to<00:02:31.000> cut<00:02:31.150> a<00:02:31.180> curve

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
a tight radius I want to cut a curve

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:35.010 
a tight radius I want to cut a curve
that's<00:02:31.600> as<00:02:31.810> long<00:02:32.080> as<00:02:32.320> this<00:02:32.560> and<00:02:33.810> it<00:02:34.810> would

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:35.020 
that's as long as this and it would

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:37.200 
that's as long as this and it would
probably<00:02:36.010> be<00:02:36.400> when<00:02:36.580> I<00:02:36.640> look<00:02:36.820> at<00:02:36.910> the<00:02:37.000> curve

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:37.210 
probably be when I look at the curve

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:38.580 
probably be when I look at the curve
would<00:02:37.420> probably<00:02:37.750> be<00:02:37.870> like<00:02:38.020> an<00:02:38.110> 8-foot<00:02:38.560> radius

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
would probably be like an 8-foot radius

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:42.660 
would probably be like an 8-foot radius
so<00:02:39.280> I<00:02:39.310> don't<00:02:39.610> want<00:02:39.730> to<00:02:39.790> do<00:02:39.850> that<00:02:41.400> so<00:02:42.400> I'm<00:02:42.520> going

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
so I don't want to do that so I'm going

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:46.290 
so I don't want to do that so I'm going
to<00:02:42.760> draw<00:02:43.330> the<00:02:43.390> curve<00:02:43.720> another<00:02:43.990> way<00:02:44.230> I<00:02:45.300> thought

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:46.300 
to draw the curve another way I thought

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:47.790 
to draw the curve another way I thought
I<00:02:46.360> might<00:02:46.600> be<00:02:46.660> able<00:02:46.870> to<00:02:46.990> put<00:02:47.260> this<00:02:47.410> up<00:02:47.620> on<00:02:47.740> the

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:47.800 
I might be able to put this up on the

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.620 
I might be able to put this up on the
easel<00:02:48.100> into<00:02:48.550> it<00:02:48.670> let's<00:02:48.940> see<00:02:49.060> if<00:02:49.150> that<00:02:49.270> works

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:49.630 
easel into it let's see if that works

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:51.570 
easel into it let's see if that works
because<00:02:50.230> I<00:02:50.260> normally<00:02:50.740> I<00:02:50.770> do<00:02:50.860> this<00:02:51.070> kneeling<00:02:51.490> on

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:51.580 
because I normally I do this kneeling on

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:54.390 
because I normally I do this kneeling on
the<00:02:51.610> floor<00:02:51.700> on<00:02:52.180> the<00:02:52.300> table<00:02:52.690> but<00:02:53.250> let's<00:02:54.250> do

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
the floor on the table but let's do

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:59.430 
the floor on the table but let's do
where<00:02:54.550> you<00:02:54.670> can<00:02:54.790> see<00:02:55.030> it<00:02:58.080> I'm<00:02:59.080> going<00:02:59.230> to<00:02:59.290> take

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 
where you can see it I'm going to take

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:02.730 
where you can see it I'm going to take
my<00:03:00.630> sharpie<00:03:01.630> just<00:03:02.080> to<00:03:02.140> make<00:03:02.290> it<00:03:02.410> easier<00:03:02.710> for

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:02.740 
my sharpie just to make it easier for

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:04.020 
my sharpie just to make it easier for
you<00:03:02.890> to<00:03:02.920> see<00:03:03.130> I<00:03:03.160> normally<00:03:03.640> do<00:03:03.730> this<00:03:03.880> with<00:03:03.970> a

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
you to see I normally do this with a

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:12.990 
you to see I normally do this with a
pencil<00:03:06.540> and<00:03:07.540> that's<00:03:09.780> 15<00:03:10.780> inches<00:03:11.760> so<00:03:12.760> I'm<00:03:12.850> going

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
pencil and that's 15 inches so I'm going

anybody<00:03:57.240> getting<00:03:57.450> a<00:03:57.600> method<00:03:57.900> to<00:03:57.990> my<00:03:58.080> madness

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:58.110 
anybody getting a method to my madness

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:05.559 
anybody getting a method to my madness
here<00:03:58.740> yet

00:04:05.559 --> 00:04:05.569 

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:11.670 

I'm<00:04:06.109> going<00:04:06.290> to<00:04:06.349> connect<00:04:06.650> 1<00:04:06.920> and<00:04:07.189> 1<00:04:07.370> right<00:04:07.700> here

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:11.680 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:17.319 

and<00:04:12.680> I'm<00:04:12.800> going<00:04:12.950> to<00:04:12.980> connect<00:04:13.250> to<00:04:13.340> and<00:04:13.640> to

00:04:17.319 --> 00:04:17.329 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:22.820 

now<00:04:18.329> I'm<00:04:18.479> going<00:04:18.630> to<00:04:18.660> three<00:04:19.579> and<00:04:20.579> three<00:04:21.800> get<00:04:22.800> the

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:22.830 
now I'm going to three and three get the

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:23.480 
now I'm going to three and three get the
idea

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:23.490 
idea

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:25.550 
idea
I<00:04:23.539> have<00:04:24.539> to<00:04:24.660> number<00:04:24.840> them<00:04:25.020> because<00:04:25.259> it's<00:04:25.410> easy

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560 
I have to number them because it's easy

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:32.059 
I have to number them because it's easy
to<00:04:25.740> get<00:04:25.949> confused<00:04:27.020> otherwise<00:04:30.410> or<00:04:31.410> maybe<00:04:31.560> maybe

00:04:32.059 --> 00:04:32.069 
to get confused otherwise or maybe maybe

00:04:32.069 --> 00:04:43.320 
to get confused otherwise or maybe maybe
it's<00:04:32.250> not<00:04:32.849> that<00:04:33.000> easy<00:04:33.180> easy<00:04:33.900> for<00:04:34.169> me<00:04:34.289> though

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:43.330 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:05:45.200 

there's<00:04:44.020> a<00:04:44.080> nice<00:04:44.320> smooth<00:04:44.650> curve

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:45.210 

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:49.850 

now<00:05:45.720> if<00:05:46.050> we're<00:05:46.650> on<00:05:46.860> a<00:05:46.889> real<00:05:47.130> job<00:05:47.430> site<00:05:47.759> here<00:05:48.860> I'd

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:49.860 
now if we're on a real job site here I'd

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:53.779 
now if we're on a real job site here I'd
probably<00:05:50.160> get<00:05:50.490> my<00:05:50.840> sandpaper<00:05:51.840> blocks<00:05:52.320> and<00:05:52.979> I'd

00:05:53.779 --> 00:05:53.789 
probably get my sandpaper blocks and I'd

00:05:53.789 --> 00:05:56.629 
probably get my sandpaper blocks and I'd
fear<00:05:54.150> this<00:05:54.360> curve<00:05:54.690> a<00:05:54.840> little<00:05:54.960> bit<00:05:55.110> and<00:05:56.100> I<00:05:56.430> would

00:05:56.629 --> 00:05:56.639 
fear this curve a little bit and I would

00:05:56.639 --> 00:05:59.840 
fear this curve a little bit and I would
absolutely<00:05:56.910> definitely<00:05:58.370> put<00:05:59.370> some<00:05:59.400> glue<00:05:59.820> here

00:05:59.840 --> 00:05:59.850 
absolutely definitely put some glue here

00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:02.870 
absolutely definitely put some glue here
a<00:06:00.620> regular<00:06:01.620> woodworking<00:06:02.070> glue<00:06:02.220> is<00:06:02.370> good

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:02.880 
a regular woodworking glue is good

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:04.790 
a regular woodworking glue is good
you<00:06:03.030> know<00:06:03.150> tight<00:06:03.419> bond<00:06:03.660> I<00:06:03.930> like<00:06:04.050> tight<00:06:04.259> bond<00:06:04.440> 3

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:04.800 
you know tight bond I like tight bond 3

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:09.740 
you know tight bond I like tight bond 3
is<00:06:04.949> a<00:06:04.979> good<00:06:05.190> glue<00:06:05.400> and<00:06:08.090> then<00:06:09.090> I<00:06:09.210> can<00:06:09.389> nail<00:06:09.539> this

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:09.750 
is a good glue and then I can nail this

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:17.180 
is a good glue and then I can nail this
on

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:17.190 

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:21.430 

and<00:06:17.490> there's<00:06:17.910> a<00:06:17.970> curve<00:06:18.300> and<00:06:18.890> I've<00:06:19.890> found<00:06:20.190> it<00:06:20.490> a

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:21.440 
and there's a curve and I've found it a

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:27.530 
and there's a curve and I've found it a
PVC<00:06:22.440> molding<00:06:23.100> a<00:06:24.860> Zac<00:06:25.860> Mercer<00:06:26.430> tech<00:06:26.700> those

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:27.540 
PVC molding a Zac Mercer tech those

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:29.090 
PVC molding a Zac Mercer tech those
moldings<00:06:27.990> are<00:06:28.110> actually<00:06:28.410> amazingly<00:06:28.830> flexible

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:29.100 
moldings are actually amazingly flexible

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:32.600 
moldings are actually amazingly flexible
and<00:06:29.630> you<00:06:30.630> can<00:06:30.660> actually<00:06:30.960> buy<00:06:31.620> a<00:06:32.040> nice

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:32.610 
and you can actually buy a nice

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:34.660 
and you can actually buy a nice
selection<00:06:32.940> of<00:06:33.150> moldings<00:06:33.540> in<00:06:33.720> this<00:06:33.870> material

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:34.670 
selection of moldings in this material

00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:37.970 
selection of moldings in this material
and<00:06:35.750> it'll<00:06:36.750> bend<00:06:36.960> right<00:06:37.140> in<00:06:37.290> here<00:06:37.530> if<00:06:37.740> it<00:06:37.890> won't

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:37.980 
and it'll bend right in here if it won't

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:39.440 
and it'll bend right in here if it won't
bend<00:06:38.280> easily<00:06:38.520> you<00:06:38.820> can<00:06:38.910> put<00:06:39.150> it<00:06:39.240> out<00:06:39.300> in<00:06:39.420> the

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:39.450 
bend easily you can put it out in the

00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:40.970 
bend easily you can put it out in the
Sun<00:06:39.720> on<00:06:39.840> a<00:06:39.900> hot<00:06:40.080> day<00:06:40.290> it'll<00:06:40.530> make<00:06:40.680> it<00:06:40.800> quite<00:06:40.950> a

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:40.980 
Sun on a hot day it'll make it quite a

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:43.040 
Sun on a hot day it'll make it quite a
bit<00:06:41.040> more<00:06:41.250> flexible<00:06:41.730> we<00:06:42.630> actually<00:06:42.900> have<00:06:42.990> a

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:43.050 
bit more flexible we actually have a

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:47.930 
bit more flexible we actually have a
heat<00:06:43.230> blanket<00:06:43.680> that<00:06:43.920> we<00:06:45.800> we<00:06:46.800> use<00:06:47.040> and<00:06:47.670> we<00:06:47.790> can

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:47.940 
heat blanket that we we use and we can

00:06:47.940 --> 00:07:05.250 
heat blanket that we we use and we can
we<00:06:48.240> can<00:06:48.270> tie<00:06:48.690> it<00:06:48.750> into<00:06:48.960> a<00:06:49.050> knot

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:05.260 

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:08.490 

so<00:07:05.710> that's<00:07:05.860> kind<00:07:06.070> of<00:07:06.130> a<00:07:06.220> stylish<00:07:06.900> look<00:07:07.900> and<00:07:08.080> we

00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:08.500 
so that's kind of a stylish look and we

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:11.700 
so that's kind of a stylish look and we
could<00:07:08.650> go<00:07:08.830> the<00:07:09.070> same<00:07:09.370> way<00:07:09.580> on<00:07:09.820> the<00:07:09.850> top<00:07:10.710> we

00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:11.710 
could go the same way on the top we

00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:17.790 
could go the same way on the top we
could<00:07:14.640> connect<00:07:15.640> this<00:07:16.450> and<00:07:16.690> this<00:07:17.260> and<00:07:17.590> draw<00:07:17.770> a

00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:17.800 
could connect this and this and draw a

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:19.440 
could connect this and this and draw a
series<00:07:18.220> of<00:07:18.370> lines<00:07:18.550> before<00:07:18.850> we<00:07:19.030> nail<00:07:19.240> these

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:19.450 
series of lines before we nail these

00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:21.450 
series of lines before we nail these
guys<00:07:19.510> in<00:07:20.020> and<00:07:20.680> we<00:07:20.770> could<00:07:20.920> have<00:07:21.010> made<00:07:21.130> a<00:07:21.160> curve

00:07:21.450 --> 00:07:21.460 
guys in and we could have made a curve

00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:22.980 
guys in and we could have made a curve
here<00:07:21.490> and<00:07:21.940> bent<00:07:22.210> it<00:07:22.270> the<00:07:22.420> other<00:07:22.570> way

00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:22.990 
here and bent it the other way

00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:24.870 
here and bent it the other way
and<00:07:23.620> if<00:07:23.740> you<00:07:23.830> look<00:07:23.980> at<00:07:24.070> old<00:07:24.220> work<00:07:24.550> that's

00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:24.880 
and if you look at old work that's

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:27.480 
and if you look at old work that's
amazingly<00:07:25.540> common<00:07:26.020> to<00:07:26.140> see<00:07:26.320> that<00:07:26.530> little

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:27.490 
amazingly common to see that little

00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:32.679 
amazingly common to see that little
detail

00:07:32.679 --> 00:07:32.689 

00:07:32.689 --> 00:07:34.749
