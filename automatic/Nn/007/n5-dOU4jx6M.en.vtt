between the middle cone and the outside

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.310 
between the middle cone and the outside
cones<00:00:29.670> should<00:00:30.269> be<00:00:30.420> the<00:00:30.570> distance<00:00:30.779> that<00:00:31.109> you

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
cones should be the distance that you

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:32.780 
cones should be the distance that you
need<00:00:31.529> to<00:00:31.619> challenge<00:00:31.890> yourself<00:00:32.130> each<00:00:32.640> and

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
need to challenge yourself each and

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.360 
need to challenge yourself each and
every<00:00:33.090> jump<00:00:33.469> suggested<00:00:34.469> distances<00:00:35.070> are<00:00:35.190> about

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
every jump suggested distances are about

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.819 
every jump suggested distances are about
four<00:00:35.670> to<00:00:35.760> six<00:00:35.790> feet<00:00:36.239> possibly<00:00:37.170> even<00:00:37.200> eight<00:00:37.620> if

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
four to six feet possibly even eight if

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.770 
four to six feet possibly even eight if
you're<00:00:37.980> a<00:00:38.010> big<00:00:38.250> jumper<00:00:38.670> now<00:00:39.090> between<00:00:39.450> the

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
you're a big jumper now between the

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.780 
you're a big jumper now between the
cones<00:00:40.020> on<00:00:40.290> the<00:00:40.379> outside<00:00:40.860> this<00:00:41.340> is<00:00:41.460> going<00:00:41.610> to<00:00:41.670> be

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
cones on the outside this is going to be

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.459 
cones on the outside this is going to be
a<00:00:41.820> little<00:00:42.000> bit<00:00:42.090> different<00:00:42.660> the<00:00:42.960> key<00:00:43.170> here<00:00:43.410> is

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
a little bit different the key here is

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.020 
a little bit different the key here is
that<00:00:43.559> we<00:00:43.770> maintain<00:00:43.980> natural<00:00:44.520> motion

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
that we maintain natural motion

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.880 
that we maintain natural motion
throughout<00:00:45.510> each<00:00:45.719> individual<00:00:46.289> jump<00:00:46.559> so<00:00:46.710> we

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
throughout each individual jump so we

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.100 
throughout each individual jump so we
can<00:00:47.039> get<00:00:47.219> results<00:00:47.760> with<00:00:47.910> our<00:00:47.940> power<00:00:48.300> so<00:00:48.960> by

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
can get results with our power so by

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.290 
can get results with our power so by
extending<00:00:49.620> them<00:00:49.770> too<00:00:50.010> far<00:00:50.370> will<00:00:50.879> get<00:00:51.030> us<00:00:51.149> off

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
extending them too far will get us off

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.540 
extending them too far will get us off
balance<00:00:51.629> as<00:00:52.020> we<00:00:52.170> get<00:00:52.350> centered<00:00:52.860> having<00:00:53.460> to

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
balance as we get centered having to

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.279 
balance as we get centered having to
turn<00:00:53.760> our<00:00:53.940> hips<00:00:54.180> before<00:00:54.390> we<00:00:54.690> make<00:00:54.870> our<00:00:54.989> next

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
turn our hips before we make our next

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.020 
turn our hips before we make our next
jump<00:00:55.530> so<00:00:56.039> we're<00:00:56.250> going<00:00:56.340> to<00:00:56.430> be<00:00:56.520> keeping<00:00:56.730> these

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
jump so we're going to be keeping these

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.670 
jump so we're going to be keeping these
cones<00:00:57.360> a<00:00:57.510> little<00:00:57.750> bit<00:00:57.870> closer<00:00:58.140> with<00:00:58.469> only

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
cones a little bit closer with only

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.340 
cones a little bit closer with only
about<00:00:58.949> two<00:00:59.309> possibly<00:01:00.239> three<00:01:00.329> feet<00:01:00.960> in<00:01:01.170> between

back and forth from cone to cone this
way<00:01:33.240> we've<00:01:33.450> got<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:33.750> right<00:01:33.930> angle<00:01:34.350> and<00:01:34.530> we

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
way we've got the right angle and we

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.640 
way we've got the right angle and we
keep<00:01:35.130> their<00:01:35.340> hips<00:01:35.579> in<00:01:35.820> line<00:01:35.880> with<00:01:36.450> the<00:01:36.570> cones<00:01:36.840> k

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
keep their hips in line with the cones k

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.140 
keep their hips in line with the cones k
bands<00:01:37.890> are<00:01:38.070> really<00:01:38.250> great<00:01:38.460> for<00:01:38.670> this<00:01:38.850> drill

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
bands are really great for this drill

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.730 
bands are really great for this drill
because<00:01:39.450> each<00:01:39.630> individual<00:01:40.200> time<00:01:40.439> that<00:01:40.650> you

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
because each individual time that you

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.830 
because each individual time that you
explosively<00:01:41.430> move<00:01:41.729> to<00:01:41.909> the<00:01:42.030> side<00:01:42.270> you're

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
explosively move to the side you're

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.359 
explosively move to the side you're
really<00:01:43.049> activating<00:01:43.860> throughout<00:01:44.189> the

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
really activating throughout the

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.580 
really activating throughout the
resistance<00:01:44.970> and<00:01:45.119> then<00:01:45.540> as<00:01:45.659> we<00:01:45.840> land<00:01:46.110> again

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
resistance and then as we land again

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.440 
resistance and then as we land again
you're<00:01:46.799> adding<00:01:47.220> more<00:01:47.399> muscle<00:01:47.850> stimulation

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
you're adding more muscle stimulation

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.569 
you're adding more muscle stimulation
because<00:01:49.229> we've<00:01:49.409> got<00:01:49.590> our<00:01:49.680> hips<00:01:49.920> nice<00:01:50.159> and<00:01:50.189> wide

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
because we've got our hips nice and wide

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.120 
because we've got our hips nice and wide
any<00:01:51.270> time<00:01:51.600> the<00:01:51.840> K<00:01:52.049> bands<00:01:52.350> are<00:01:52.530> scrapped<00:01:52.829> around

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
any time the K bands are scrapped around

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.920 
any time the K bands are scrapped around
our<00:01:53.250> legs<00:01:53.490> and<00:01:53.670> we're<00:01:53.880> in<00:01:53.970> a<00:01:54.060> catch<00:01:54.299> position

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
our legs and we're in a catch position

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.539 
our legs and we're in a catch position
well<00:01:55.320> we've<00:01:55.439> got<00:01:55.470> those<00:01:55.799> knees<00:01:56.130> a<00:01:56.159> little<00:01:56.430> bit

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
well we've got those knees a little bit

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.459 
well we've got those knees a little bit
wider<00:01:56.880> than<00:01:57.030> shoulder<00:01:57.570> width<00:01:57.750> you've<00:01:58.200> got

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
wider than shoulder width you've got

glute<00:01:58.829> activation<00:01:59.040> this<00:02:00.030> is<00:02:00.149> really<00:02:00.299> going<00:02:00.450> to

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
glute activation this is really going to

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.179 
glute activation this is really going to
help<00:02:00.659> with<00:02:00.840> our<00:02:00.990> stability<00:02:01.229> muscles<00:02:01.860> as<00:02:01.979> we

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
help with our stability muscles as we

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.370 
help with our stability muscles as we
land<00:02:02.460> as<00:02:02.729> well<00:02:03.180> as<00:02:03.630> get<00:02:03.810> a<00:02:03.840> little<00:02:04.110> bit<00:02:04.229> more

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
land as well as get a little bit more

to two minutes remember football players
it's<00:02:28.470> very<00:02:28.709> important<00:02:29.280> that<00:02:29.310> we<00:02:29.430> really<00:02:29.790> move

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
it's very important that we really move

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.839 
it's very important that we really move
explosively<00:02:31.050> and<00:02:31.380> jump<00:02:31.950> out<00:02:32.130> as<00:02:32.310> far<00:02:32.580> as<00:02:32.700> we

00:02:32.839 --> 00:02:32.849 
explosively and jump out as far as we

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:36.259 
explosively and jump out as far as we
can<00:02:33.060> more<00:02:33.780> vertical<00:02:34.440> more<00:02:34.980> power<00:02:35.310> equals<00:02:36.060> more

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:36.269 
can more vertical more power equals more

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:38.150 
can more vertical more power equals more
speed<00:02:36.690> so<00:02:37.170> we've<00:02:37.319> got<00:02:37.470> to<00:02:37.590> really<00:02:37.709> be<00:02:37.800> powerful

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
speed so we've got to really be powerful

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.610 
speed so we've got to really be powerful
and<00:02:38.580> get<00:02:38.940> out<00:02:39.030> as<00:02:39.180> far<00:02:39.420> as<00:02:39.540> we<00:02:39.690> can<00:02:39.900> challenging

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
and get out as far as we can challenging

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.830 
and get out as far as we can challenging
ourselves<00:02:40.769> each<00:02:41.280> individual<00:02:41.910> jump<00:02:42.180> don't<00:02:42.720> be
