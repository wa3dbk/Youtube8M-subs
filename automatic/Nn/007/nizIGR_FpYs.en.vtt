00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
there as you can tell there's the sake

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.630 
there as you can tell there's the sake
of<00:01:17.820> that<00:01:18.030> jazz<00:01:18.509> would<00:01:18.689> be<00:01:19.259> held<00:01:19.470> in<00:01:19.650> and<00:01:19.920> that's

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
of that jazz would be held in and that's

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.320 
of that jazz would be held in and that's
basically<00:01:20.909> it<00:01:21.150> pretty<00:01:21.450> much<00:01:22.610> so<00:01:23.610> jazz<00:01:24.060> he

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
missile and a missile in here listen

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.170 
missile and a missile in here listen
tell<00:01:35.820> they're<00:01:36.630> all<00:01:36.720> the<00:01:36.840> same<00:01:37.520> so<00:01:38.520> it<00:01:38.939> doesn't

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
tell they're all the same so it doesn't

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.390 
tell they're all the same so it doesn't
really<00:01:39.240> matter<00:01:39.450> which<00:01:39.659> one<00:01:39.869> you<00:01:39.900> put<00:01:40.110> in<00:01:40.400> these

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.380 
two are just extras in case you lose the
others<00:01:43.350> so<00:01:44.280> when<00:01:44.610> you<00:01:44.700> shoot<00:01:44.909> the<00:01:45.180> missile

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:46.750 
so I'll just go ahead and get to the

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:48.300 
so I'll just go ahead and get to the
transformation<00:03:47.350> which<00:03:47.650> will<00:03:47.890> be<00:03:48.010> pretty

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.310 
transformation which will be pretty

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:50.640 
transformation which will be pretty
quick<00:03:49.080> first<00:03:50.080> thing<00:03:50.200> that<00:03:50.350> you're<00:03:50.410> go<00:03:50.500> ahead

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:50.650 
quick first thing that you're go ahead

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:53.790 
quick first thing that you're go ahead
and<00:03:50.740> do<00:03:50.800> is<00:03:51.010> extend<00:03:51.430> the<00:03:51.640> legs<00:03:52.620> fold<00:03:53.620> them<00:03:53.770> up

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:53.800 
and do is extend the legs fold them up

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:58.400 
and do is extend the legs fold them up
like<00:03:54.010> that<00:03:54.660> folded<00:03:55.660> feet<00:03:55.900> and<00:03:56.880> separate<00:03:57.880> the

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:58.410 
like that folded feet and separate the

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:01.080 
like that folded feet and separate the
feet<00:03:59.410> right<00:03:59.440> here<00:03:59.620> which<00:04:00.160> can<00:04:00.520> sometimes<00:04:00.730> be

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:01.090 
feet right here which can sometimes be

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:04.500 
feet right here which can sometimes be
pretty<00:04:01.390> difficult<00:04:01.570> so<00:04:02.970> I'll<00:04:03.970> try<00:04:04.240> and<00:04:04.300> get

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:04.510 
pretty difficult so I'll try and get

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:08.580 
pretty difficult so I'll try and get
this<00:04:04.600> done<00:04:04.860> there<00:04:05.860> you<00:04:05.950> go<00:04:07.050> the<00:04:08.050> next<00:04:08.500> thing

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:08.590 
this done there you go the next thing

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:11.430 
this done there you go the next thing

I<00:06:01.540> just<00:06:01.840> noticed<00:06:02.140> this<00:06:02.230> right<00:06:02.410> now<00:06:02.530> why<00:06:02.710> it's

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:02.860 
I just noticed this right now why it's

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:08.130 
I just noticed this right now why it's
kind<00:06:03.040> of<00:06:03.270> jiggly<00:06:04.270> I'll<00:06:04.810> figure<00:06:05.200> it<00:06:05.320> out<00:06:06.780> so<00:06:07.780> I

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:08.140 
kind of jiggly I'll figure it out so I

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:09.630 
kind of jiggly I'll figure it out so I
have<00:06:08.380> a<00:06:08.410> size<00:06:08.740> comparison<00:06:08.919> for<00:06:09.460> you<00:06:09.520> real

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:09.640 
have a size comparison for you real

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:16.239 
have a size comparison for you real
quick<00:06:09.700> so<00:06:10.060> I'll<00:06:10.180> go<00:06:10.300> ahead<00:06:10.330> and<00:06:10.450> get<00:06:10.570> that

00:06:16.239 --> 00:06:16.249 

00:06:16.249 --> 00:06:20.379 

so<00:06:16.999> here's<00:06:17.179> my<00:06:17.239> size<00:06:17.569> comparison<00:06:18.969> it's<00:06:19.969> gon

00:06:20.379 --> 00:06:20.389 
so here's my size comparison it's gon

00:06:20.389 --> 00:06:22.449 
so here's my size comparison it's gon
Prime<00:06:20.659> obviously<00:06:21.169> as<00:06:21.349> you<00:06:21.739> can<00:06:21.829> tell<00:06:22.069> Joan

00:06:22.449 --> 00:06:22.459 
Prime obviously as you can tell Joan
