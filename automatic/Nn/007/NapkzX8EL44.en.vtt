00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:10.050
 now welcome to the transit areal 

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:11.849
 for permanent why circle and communes 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.929
 I explain how to do that 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.000
 ever get this coming 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.369
 you have to sell yourself as well 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.410
 it seems only solo choir 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.199
 I have never seen multiple 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.880
 I have to buy it must go down 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.070
 again , marseille already removes the 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.920
 green smoke and that means you 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.779
 grab and you can handle three 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.480
 would withstand the blows promote 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.160
 animal death last explanation why that 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:39.239
 are training as you can in it 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:41.370
 making as well as in transit because 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.460
 So these are the main maps say now 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.620
 times the permanent works you also in 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.110
 You still had transit in here 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.340
 Dreis if you make 1 in davos now 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.420
 then you have them in transit and 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.149
 the other way round 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:57.420
 So I hope that understands funny 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:01:02.160
 but well , that's not how it is now 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:04.080
 as permanent as you think because I show 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.090
 you're in the second game 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.950
 I now always experience one on one 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.720
 almhÃ¼tte will 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:11.540
 So I did my job that was it 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.729
 still in their own game 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:16.320
 and then I had yesterday I've yet 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.520
 participated only online games by 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.009
 my team no more 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.180
 so it's not that prominent so it's exciting 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.869
 Do not get up and ask in the 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.970
 comments to 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.460
 Why is it suddenly with you ? 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.799
 Often it is so natural now 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.200
 also what happens if you can 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:33.780
 is buying again so is actually synonymous 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.880
 Clear that you have at least one and more 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.560
 that is also holds so this time 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.630
 five strokes out and the sixth man 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.100
 dying is right in any case 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.189
 cool feature what the now with the 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:46.710
 patch 1.06 have brought in 

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:48.780
 the patch 1.06 was also released yesterday 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.310
 the ps3 so the ps3 people can do that 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.590
 already do it this time 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.210
 the xbox live were already five six 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.600
 make days earlier if I have such a 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.970
 week a little bit more 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:03.110
