00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
hey welcome to proko today we're going

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:15.730 
hey welcome to proko today we're going
over<00:00:14.730> the<00:00:14.880> nose

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:15.740 
over the nose

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:18.380 
over the nose
we<00:00:16.740> have<00:00:16.890> noses<00:00:17.130> of<00:00:17.430> all<00:00:17.670> shapes<00:00:18.119> and<00:00:18.300> sizes

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
we have noses of all shapes and sizes

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.480 
we have noses of all shapes and sizes
but<00:00:18.960> there<00:00:19.410> are<00:00:19.500> things<00:00:19.740> they<00:00:19.890> all<00:00:20.070> have<00:00:20.340> in

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
but there are things they all have in

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.550 
but there are things they all have in
common<00:00:20.600> we<00:00:21.600> should<00:00:21.810> understand<00:00:22.350> these

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
common we should understand these

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.410 
common we should understand these
similarities<00:00:23.189> so<00:00:23.519> that<00:00:23.670> we<00:00:23.760> can<00:00:23.910> solve<00:00:24.090> any

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
similarities so that we can solve any

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.269 
nose from any angle in the next few
minutes<00:00:27.390> we'll<00:00:27.869> simplify<00:00:28.349> the<00:00:28.410> nose<00:00:28.710> into<00:00:29.039> its

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
minutes we'll simplify the nose into its

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.099 
minutes we'll simplify the nose into its
major<00:00:29.550> planes<00:00:29.939> to<00:00:30.510> understand<00:00:30.960> the

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
major planes to understand the

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.010 
major planes to understand the
perspective<00:00:31.710> from<00:00:31.890> various<00:00:32.399> angles<00:00:32.969> then<00:00:33.780> we

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
perspective from various angles then we

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.930 
perspective from various angles then we
will<00:00:34.170> go<00:00:34.290> deeper<00:00:34.500> and<00:00:34.890> explore<00:00:34.980> the<00:00:35.430> anatomy

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
will go deeper and explore the anatomy

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.810 
will go deeper and explore the anatomy
and<00:00:36.059> finally<00:00:37.050> based<00:00:37.440> on<00:00:37.710> the<00:00:37.860> anatomy<00:00:38.129> break

classes I see a lot of people struggling
to<00:00:47.430> get<00:00:47.550> the<00:00:47.700> nose<00:00:47.940> pointing<00:00:48.660> in<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:48.899> right

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
to get the nose pointing in the right

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.920 
to get the nose pointing in the right
direction<00:00:49.079> and<00:00:49.770> to<00:00:50.399> look<00:00:50.520> three-dimensional

to<00:00:51.930> do<00:00:52.050> this<00:00:52.199> correctly<00:00:52.410> it's<00:00:52.920> important<00:00:53.370> to

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
to do this correctly it's important to

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.490 
to do this correctly it's important to
understand<00:00:53.879> the<00:00:54.000> nose<00:00:54.210> as<00:00:54.449> a<00:00:54.510> simplified<00:00:55.140> box

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
understand the nose as a simplified box

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.459 
understand the nose as a simplified box
there<00:00:56.430> are<00:00:56.460> the<00:00:56.760> side<00:00:57.000> planes<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:57.899> top<00:00:58.170> plane

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
there are the side planes the top plane

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.279 
there are the side planes the top plane
and<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:59.129> bottom<00:00:59.489> plane<00:00:59.699> as<00:00:59.910> the<00:01:00.870> head<00:01:01.020> turns

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
and the bottom plane as the head turns

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.100 
and the bottom plane as the head turns
to<00:01:01.469> the<00:01:01.559> side<00:01:01.829> or<00:01:02.129> up<00:01:02.430> and<00:01:02.730> down<00:01:02.789> all<00:01:03.750> the

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
to the side or up and down all the

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.840 
to the side or up and down all the
angles<00:01:04.559> and<00:01:04.680> shapes<00:01:04.949> of<00:01:05.189> the<00:01:05.280> nose<00:01:05.489> will

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
angles and shapes of the nose will

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.969 
angles and shapes of the nose will
change<00:01:06.210> this<00:01:06.869> could<00:01:07.110> get<00:01:07.200> really<00:01:07.590> complicated

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
change this could get really complicated

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.890 
change this could get really complicated
and<00:01:08.430> that's<00:01:08.729> why<00:01:08.970> it's<00:01:09.150> so<00:01:09.330> important<00:01:09.840> to

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
and that's why it's so important to

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.080 
and that's why it's so important to
first<00:01:10.229> solve<00:01:10.650> the<00:01:10.799> perspective<00:01:11.490> of<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:11.790> box

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
first solve the perspective of the box

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.380 
first solve the perspective of the box
and<00:01:12.450> then<00:01:13.080> add<00:01:13.380> the<00:01:13.590> anatomy<00:01:14.010> so<00:01:14.850> let's<00:01:15.240> see

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
and then add the anatomy so let's see

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.300 
and then add the anatomy so let's see
what<00:01:15.540> happens<00:01:15.900> to<00:01:16.049> the<00:01:16.170> major<00:01:16.380> planes<00:01:16.740> as<00:01:17.009> the

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
what happens to the major planes as the

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.240 
what happens to the major planes as the
head<00:01:17.490> moves<00:01:17.869> from<00:01:18.869> the<00:01:19.020> front<00:01:19.290> view<00:01:19.500> the<00:01:20.009> tip

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
head moves from the front view the tip

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:21.770 
head moves from the front view the tip
of<00:01:20.369> the<00:01:20.490> nose<00:01:20.670> is<00:01:21.000> aligned<00:01:21.420> with<00:01:21.659> the

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
of the nose is aligned with the

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.899 
of the nose is aligned with the
centerline<00:01:22.110> of<00:01:22.470> the<00:01:22.530> face<00:01:22.770> and<00:01:23.100> the<00:01:23.700> side

centerline of the face and the side

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.149 
centerline of the face and the side
planes<00:01:24.270> are<00:01:24.509> the<00:01:24.630> same<00:01:24.840> width<00:01:25.140> as<00:01:25.320> the<00:01:25.979> head

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
planes are the same width as the head

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.160 
planes are the same width as the head
terms<00:01:26.460> of<00:01:26.670> the<00:01:26.729> side<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.509> tip<00:01:27.750> of<00:01:27.900> the<00:01:27.990> nose

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
will extend away from the centerline

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.539 
will extend away from the centerline
because<00:01:30.960> if<00:01:31.110> we're<00:01:31.290> shortening<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:32.009> far<00:01:32.250> side

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.730 
because if we're shortening the far side
plane<00:01:32.880> will<00:01:33.090> get<00:01:33.240> thinner<00:01:33.570> and<00:01:33.810> the<00:01:34.470> closer

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
plane will get thinner and the closer

the<00:01:59.939> nose<00:02:00.119> will<00:02:00.420> get<00:02:00.600> closer<00:02:00.899> to<00:02:01.259> the<00:02:01.350> eyes

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880 
the nose will get closer to the eyes

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.219 
the nose will get closer to the eyes
eventually<00:02:02.880> it<00:02:03.090> will<00:02:03.240> even<00:02:03.479> cover<00:02:03.869> a<00:02:03.960> portion

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
of the eye the tendency for many artists

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.559 
of the eye the tendency for many artists
is<00:02:07.229> to<00:02:07.500> lower<00:02:07.740> the<00:02:07.829> tip<00:02:08.129> of<00:02:08.280> the<00:02:08.340> nose<00:02:08.520> but<00:02:09.479> if

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
is to lower the tip of the nose but if

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.600 
is to lower the tip of the nose but if
you<00:02:09.660> do<00:02:09.869> that<00:02:10.110> then<00:02:10.800> the<00:02:10.920> nose<00:02:11.099> will<00:02:11.310> point<00:02:11.489> in

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
you do that then the nose will point in

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:12.770 
you do that then the nose will point in
a<00:02:11.670> different<00:02:11.819> direction<00:02:12.150> than<00:02:12.480> the
