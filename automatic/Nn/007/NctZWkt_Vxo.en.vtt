just in two rooms above the blacksmith I

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.490

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
Harry had passed the shop on to his sons

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.930 
Harry had passed the shop on to his sons
Arthur<00:02:23.230> and<00:02:23.379> Len<00:02:23.560> who<00:02:24.190> ran<00:02:24.519> it<00:02:24.640> together

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
Arthur and Len who ran it together

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.210 
Arthur and Len who ran it together
particles<00:02:25.780> were<00:02:25.900> really<00:02:26.230> important<00:02:26.920> because

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
particles were really important because

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:30.570 
particles were really important because
of<00:02:28.030> the<00:02:28.390> rarity<00:02:28.780> of<00:02:29.080> fuel<00:02:29.440> cars<00:02:30.280> were<00:02:30.430> only

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.580 
of the rarity of fuel cars were only

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:32.780 
of the rarity of fuel cars were only
really<00:02:30.910> used<00:02:31.150> for<00:02:31.420> VIP<00:02:31.870> journeys<00:02:32.500> and

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
really used for VIP journeys and

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.830 
really used for VIP journeys and
absolutely<00:02:33.790> necessary<00:02:34.000> Jones

absolutely necessary Jones

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.559 
absolutely necessary Jones
so<00:02:35.470> the<00:02:36.160> bicycle<00:02:36.610> was<00:02:36.700> really<00:02:37.000> a<00:02:37.030> form<00:02:37.510> of

00:02:37.559 --> 00:02:37.569 
so the bicycle was really a form of

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:39.720 
so the bicycle was really a form of
transport<00:02:38.049> loot<00:02:38.440> was<00:02:38.799> hugely<00:02:39.130> important<00:02:39.640> to

00:02:45.809 --> 00:02:45.819 
father and his brother were now on the

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:47.940 
father and his brother were now on the
scene<00:02:46.060> my<00:02:46.390> father<00:02:46.630> Roger<00:02:46.900> was<00:02:47.260> very<00:02:47.590> keen<00:02:47.829> on

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
we were given bikes that he had repaired

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.699 
we were given bikes that he had repaired

unfortunately he died 15 years ago of
the<00:03:22.239> illness<00:03:22.540> that<00:03:22.660> he<00:03:22.750> had<00:03:23.019> he<00:03:23.650> was<00:03:23.859> pretty

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:24.489 
the illness that he had he was pretty

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:27.509 
the illness that he had he was pretty
much<00:03:24.670> cycling<00:03:25.299> up<00:03:25.840> to<00:03:26.290> even<00:03:26.950> a<00:03:27.010> couple<00:03:27.220> of<00:03:27.370> days

00:03:27.509 --> 00:03:27.519 
much cycling up to even a couple of days

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:29.759 
much cycling up to even a couple of days
before<00:03:28.000> he<00:03:28.180> died<00:03:28.389> I<00:03:28.690> had<00:03:29.109> managed<00:03:29.380> to<00:03:29.440> take<00:03:29.650> him

00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:29.769 
before he died I had managed to take him

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:31.800 
before he died I had managed to take him
out<00:03:29.889> on<00:03:30.040> the<00:03:30.130> tandem<00:03:30.519> and<00:03:30.639> he<00:03:31.420> had<00:03:31.569> a<00:03:31.600> lovely

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:31.810 
out on the tandem and he had a lovely

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:33.400 
out on the tandem and he had a lovely
time

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:33.410 
time

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:35.680 
time
and<00:03:34.280> then<00:03:34.430> think<00:03:34.820> what<00:03:34.880> should<00:03:35.150> do<00:03:35.300> is<00:03:35.420> press

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:35.690 
and then think what should do is press

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:37.810 
and then think what should do is press
during<00:03:36.350> the<00:03:36.500> SI<00:03:36.680> angle<00:03:37.100> forward<00:03:37.400> a<00:03:37.580> little<00:03:37.700> bit

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:37.820 
during the SI angle forward a little bit

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:40.480 
during the SI angle forward a little bit
and<00:03:38.210> then<00:03:38.440> maybe<00:03:39.440> change<00:03:39.770> this<00:03:40.010> to<00:03:40.220> the<00:03:40.340> new

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:40.490 
and then maybe change this to the new

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:42.580 
and then maybe change this to the new
time<00:03:40.790> it<00:03:41.120> was<00:03:41.270> a<00:03:41.300> natural<00:03:41.510> progression<00:03:41.810> for<00:03:42.560> us

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:42.590 
time it was a natural progression for us

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:46.120 
time it was a natural progression for us
to<00:03:42.920> move<00:03:43.100> into<00:03:43.280> the<00:03:43.640> shop<00:03:44.230> we<00:03:45.230> always<00:03:45.860> felt<00:03:46.010> in

to move into the shop we always felt in

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:47.500 
to move into the shop we always felt in
the<00:03:46.190> back<00:03:46.340> of<00:03:46.460> our<00:03:46.520> mind<00:03:46.790> that<00:03:46.910> there<00:03:47.210> was<00:03:47.330> this

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:47.510 
the back of our mind that there was this

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:51.160 
the back of our mind that there was this
very<00:03:48.460> interest<00:03:49.460> in<00:03:49.610> business<00:03:50.030> that<00:03:50.750> we<00:03:50.930> had

very interest in business that we had

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:54.070 
very interest in business that we had
great<00:03:51.980> passion<00:03:52.670> for<00:03:52.700> there's<00:03:53.330> no<00:03:53.480> great
