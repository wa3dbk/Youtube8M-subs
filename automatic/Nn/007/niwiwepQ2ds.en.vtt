00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
damage to lift that works its way up and

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.299 
damage to lift that works its way up and
down<00:00:57.960> this<00:00:58.350> this<00:00:59.250> chord<00:00:59.760> here<00:01:00.050> and<00:01:01.309> what

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
you'll do is you'll jump up on top of

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.690 
you'll do is you'll jump up on top of
the<00:01:04.080> lift<00:01:04.320> and<00:01:04.650> then<00:01:04.979> you'll<00:01:05.159> take<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:05.400> ride

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.310 
the lift and then you'll take the ride
down<00:01:06.000> and<00:01:06.330> you<00:01:06.390> can<00:01:06.540> actually<00:01:06.689> see<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.140> data

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
down and you can actually see the data

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.429 
down and you can actually see the data
Chron<00:01:07.680> down<00:01:07.920> below<00:01:08.280> there<00:01:08.520> and<00:01:09.350> actually<00:01:10.350> we

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
Chron down below there and actually we

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.039 
Chron down below there and actually we
got<00:01:10.560> lucky<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.220> lift<00:01:11.610> is<00:01:11.820> actually<00:01:12.270> making

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
got lucky the lift is actually making

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.999 
got lucky the lift is actually making
its<00:01:13.170> way<00:01:13.290> back<00:01:13.320> up<00:01:13.530> here<00:01:15.470> so<00:01:16.470> I'll<00:01:16.590> wait<00:01:16.710> for<00:01:16.920> it

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
its way back up here so I'll wait for it

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.410 
its way back up here so I'll wait for it
to<00:01:17.070> get<00:01:17.159> just<00:01:17.520> a<00:01:17.640> little<00:01:17.670> bit<00:01:17.970> closer<00:01:18.240> and

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
to get just a little bit closer and

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.310 
to get just a little bit closer and
we're<00:01:18.540> going<00:01:18.659> to<00:01:18.720> make<00:01:18.840> our<00:01:18.960> jump<00:01:19.259> here<00:01:19.470> and

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:21.320 
we're going to make our jump here and

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:22.730 
we're going to make our jump here and
there<00:01:22.320> we<00:01:22.409> go

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
there we go

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.920 
there we go
as<00:01:24.560> the<00:01:25.560> lift<00:01:25.979> reaches<00:01:26.490> the<00:01:26.640> bottom<00:01:26.790> here<00:01:27.270> you

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
as the lift reaches the bottom here you

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.350 
as the lift reaches the bottom here you
might<00:01:28.110> want<00:01:28.290> to<00:01:28.380> switch<00:01:28.619> over<00:01:28.740> to<00:01:28.890> a<00:01:29.360> top-down

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
might want to switch over to a top-down

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.440 
might want to switch over to a top-down
camera<00:01:30.900> view<00:01:31.110> so<00:01:31.409> that<00:01:31.590> when<00:01:31.710> you<00:01:31.799> do<00:01:32.070> your

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:32.450 
camera view so that when you do your

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.050 
camera view so that when you do your
your<00:01:33.450> jump<00:01:34.020> off<00:01:34.200> you'll<00:01:34.770> hit<00:01:35.400> the<00:01:35.549> right<00:01:35.700> spot

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
your jump off you'll hit the right spot

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.109 
your jump off you'll hit the right spot
here<00:01:36.860> have<00:01:37.860> to<00:01:38.009> wait<00:01:38.130> for<00:01:38.340> it<00:01:38.430> to<00:01:38.460> get<00:01:38.640> a<00:01:38.670> little

here have to wait for it to get a little

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:45.230 
here have to wait for it to get a little
bit<00:01:39.479> closer<00:01:41.090> and<00:01:42.090> here<00:01:42.780> we<00:01:42.869> go<00:01:43.939> go<00:01:44.939> ahead<00:01:45.090> and

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
bit closer and here we go go ahead and

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.770 
bit closer and here we go go ahead and
grab<00:01:45.479> your<00:01:45.689> data<00:01:45.869> cron<00:01:46.759> the<00:01:47.759> second<00:01:48.270> data<00:01:48.420> cron
