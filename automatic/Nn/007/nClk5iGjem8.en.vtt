00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:16.680
 hello backstage hello on the ces hello 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.539
 in las vegas we are here at the moment 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.189
 stand by nvidia and what we are 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.539
 now here immediately behind closed 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.060
 to look at the door that is one of 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.439
 the small highlights of the team is 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.560
 So small highlights is actually so 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.760
 in terms of form factor in itself has quite 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.920
 a lot of furore we talked about 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:38.190
 project switches the is gaming device 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:41.250
 from nvidia this gaming device is supposed to be around 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.290
 the 250 to 300 euros cost so our 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.059
 But there was not exactly that 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.309
 we have a little bit out there out 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.960
 belongs exactly and is projected 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.550
 so interesting because it is for 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.370
 a flat on android he runs his 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.379
 console is also the pc games 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.120
 can play if a pc in the vicinity 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.920
 is and a lot more and what 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.940
 everything exactly and how and at all that 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.859
 we could now just to 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.690
 exactly and only maybe one 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:06.060
 sent it in advance, I should have said it 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.360
 you have to be more modest from sony and 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.070
 microsoft should puke in the beam 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:15.119
 with the 2 i would say that cut 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:19.090
 we do not get told so I puke the 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:20.859
 beam every day 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:23.859
 Me too, and we are here 

00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:25.060
 Resistance in the india stood in it 

00:01:23.859 --> 00:01:28.859
 because we have something very whole here 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:31.000
 Great the new projection console from 

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:33.549
 nvidia that looks if you look yes 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.799
 everything works fine, too 

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:38.860
 console the android as the operating system 

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:41.229
 has on it and you can see it here 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:45.359
 can switch back and forth a 5 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:48.700
 inch display has about 260 

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:51.520
 pixel density of about 2 160 pixels 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:55.720
 and a 27p display 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:57.729
 we have the bees on it and you can 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:59.289
 here are just a lot of games play on 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:01.390
 one side the whole android apps 

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:04.420
 which we just have there but also and 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:05.890
 this is the special game on the 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:07.119
 pc I have the daniel yes 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:09.879
 ultimately next to me as an old one 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:11.530
 specialists then maybe 

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:13.480
 Let's talk a little bit about what we can do then 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.280
 right here just like that and can see 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.810
 what we can play the other one though 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.239
 now look at the console here 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.769
 looks a bit like xbox 360 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:22.480
 controller we have the whole 

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:24.790
 you just as well button them like that 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.620
 confess that means all variations 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:29.500
 are supported here we have here 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.579
 an audio output here are hdmi output 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:34.450
 I've already seen him hiding 

00:02:30.579 --> 00:02:39.099
 and next to it is also a usb plug the 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:41.349
 the final on it runs the whole 

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:42.970
 normal consoles buttons the same way 

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:45.220
 knows for the whole games and here 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:46.150
 front and there in the video too special 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.810
 proud of it 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:51.099
 an audiosystem that has it all in it 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:53.260
 should it be warmer just not yet 

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:55.090
 because it was here with pcr 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:59.200
 connected to the television 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:02.660
 here can be between the android 3 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:05.150
 and the nvidia own july back and forth 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:06.680
 turn on and on the games 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:08.150
 or on the pcs and so on 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.209
 Next you just then as streaming 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:11.390
 has deposited service back and forth 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:13.040
 dry 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:15.050
 I think this is now also time times 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:17.870
 that we play a bit and that 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:19.250
 service look at the daniel casual already 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:21.050
 one can also have built up 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:23.360
 right high end games on the device 

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:24.950
 dry only the games do not run at all 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:26.209
 that's why nvidia calls system 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:28.310
 actually it too actually seemed 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:30.110
 also not console but gaming the 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:33.860
 knows what works so I have here 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:38.080
 actually run a pc game 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:41.720
 the pc is behind there somewhere 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:44.360
 behind the corner and that is 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:47.690
 crypt equipped with really delicious 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:49.489
 art who high with high graphics cards 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:51.709
 end processors neat disk 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:53.480
 really much ram and so on that is 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:55.130
 the game I see here now 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:56.900
 does not work on the console but 

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:58.700
 the console gets the picture just by 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:02.269
 network leaked the actual 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:04.940
 Game runs on the pc and at least 

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:07.040
 currently it is so that nvidia for one 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:08.630
 software will be available on the 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:10.220
 pc installed that means the pc stands 

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:12.739
 somewhere in the basement or in the living room 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:14.480
 and if you 're comfortable with the console 

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:15.829
 sitting on the living room table or the 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:17.350
 console even then a tv 

00:04:15.829 --> 00:04:19.030
 can connect over the halls 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:20.800
 the exit and pulled one must the pc 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:22.270
 I should not have stood there 

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:25.030
 who are elsewhere 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:26.170
 later there is also the possibility that 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:27.970
 the games are no longer local 

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:31.030
 ever run on any pc 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:32.350
 but that over the internet 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:34.360
 cloud service 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:36.220
 The appropriate solution for Verein Street 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:39.580
 nvidia has also in the offer, however 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:41.950
 not for private customers but for 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:44.260
 Internet provider 53 Amazon for example 

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:47.200
 could there be a candidate in the 

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:49.060
 future such games such games 

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:50.800
 services offers so that you can also play 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:52.960
 not have to buy anymore but just 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:54.520
 concludes an abo and then for one 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:57.910
 certain amount per month or per 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:59.770
 hours his games can play 

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:01.090
 the advantage of not playing on the 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:02.920
 console runs but on the pcs 

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:04.000
 Of course, that the battery less 

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:06.280
 is charged because the whole 

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.870
 Graph calculation does not work here 

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:10.210
 if you go back fabi in the background one 

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:13.060
 Android plays then keeps the battery 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:14.590
 supposedly eight to ten hours so if 

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:15.670
 the game does not run on the console 

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:18.340
 and on the pc 

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:19.600
 then, actually, even now 

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:21.790
 you can see it now I'm finally 

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:24.400
 over the lead and can 

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:26.890
 play in any case so in streaming 

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:28.510
 Mode should actually be 20 hours 

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:30.900
 playing with a battery is possible 

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:30.900
 his
