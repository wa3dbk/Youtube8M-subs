00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
they can be more absorbed by our skin

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.860 
they can be more absorbed by our skin
and<00:02:31.890> I<00:02:32.280> actually<00:02:32.460> like<00:02:32.850> to<00:02:32.880> do<00:02:33.180> this<00:02:33.390> with<00:02:33.690> my

that<00:02:40.380> bind<00:02:41.070> with<00:02:41.430> water<00:02:41.760> so<00:02:42.330> we<00:02:42.480> want<00:02:42.720> to<00:02:42.840> use

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
that bind with water so we want to use

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.140 
that bind with water so we want to use
the<00:02:43.590> water<00:02:43.860> to<00:02:44.160> help<00:02:44.310> transport<00:02:45.000> those

nutrients are still there and we're

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:28.400 
nutrients are still there and we're
still<00:03:26.490> getting<00:03:26.820> all<00:03:27.000> of<00:03:27.540> the<00:03:27.660> caffeine<00:03:28.140> that's
