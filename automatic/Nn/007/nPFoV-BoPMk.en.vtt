out first and this is the book the video
on<00:01:22.170> how<00:01:22.409> to<00:01:22.680> operate<00:01:23.369> this<00:01:23.549> machine<00:01:23.610> and<00:01:24.509> the

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
on how to operate this machine and the

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.210 
on how to operate this machine and the
tricks<00:01:26.810> so<00:01:27.810> I<00:01:27.840> can't<00:01:28.170> wait<00:01:28.320> to<00:01:28.350> get<00:01:28.650> to<00:01:28.710> it<00:01:29.040> to

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
tricks so I can't wait to get to it to

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.130 
tricks so I can't wait to get to it to
read<00:01:29.430> it

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:33.140 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.310 

and<00:01:33.770> then<00:01:34.340> there's<00:01:34.610> a<00:01:34.790> metal<00:01:35.030> box<00:01:35.360> I'm<00:01:35.750> trying

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:36.320 
and then there's a metal box I'm trying

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.790 
and then there's a metal box I'm trying
to<00:01:36.470> do<00:01:36.560> the<00:01:36.710> small<00:01:37.010> things<00:01:37.040> first<00:01:38.620> so<00:01:39.620> it

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:39.800 
to do the small things first so it

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.899 
to do the small things first so it
really<00:01:40.130> doesn't<00:01:40.460> have<00:01:40.729> all<00:01:40.970> the<00:01:41.030> many<00:01:41.869> things

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:42.909 
really doesn't have all the many things

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:52.560 
really doesn't have all the many things
in<00:01:43.909> the<00:01:44.090> box<00:01:45.460> so<00:01:47.740> okay<00:01:48.740> so<00:01:48.770> this<00:01:49.250> is<00:01:49.520> the<00:01:49.900> table

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:52.570 
in the box so okay so this is the table

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:58.600 
in the box so okay so this is the table
it<00:01:53.570> includes<00:01:53.830> a<00:01:55.600> long<00:01:56.600> table<00:01:57.369> but<00:01:58.369> when<00:01:58.490> you

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:58.610 
it includes a long table but when you

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:02.710 
it includes a long table but when you
are<00:01:58.729> doing<00:01:58.909> larger<00:01:59.690> projects<00:02:00.880> you<00:02:01.880> know<00:02:02.030> so<00:02:02.450> is

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:02.720 
are doing larger projects you know so is

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:11.590 
are doing larger projects you know so is
bolting<00:02:03.820> all<00:02:04.820> that's<00:02:05.149> up<00:02:08.380> here<00:02:10.269> and<00:02:11.269> it<00:02:11.420> has<00:02:11.570> a

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:11.600 
bolting all that's up here and it has a

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:15.160 
bolting all that's up here and it has a
measurements<00:02:13.180> maybe<00:02:14.180> that's<00:02:14.750> gonna<00:02:14.959> make

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
measurements maybe that's gonna make

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:21.220 
measurements maybe that's gonna make
life<00:02:15.440> way<00:02:15.980> easier<00:02:16.900> and<00:02:17.900> if<00:02:18.230> it<00:02:19.600> we<00:02:20.600> can<00:02:20.810> make<00:02:21.050> it

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
life way easier and if it we can make it

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:26.680 
life way easier and if it we can make it
stand<00:02:22.030> awesome<00:02:23.030> and<00:02:24.340> that<00:02:25.340> one<00:02:25.550> also<00:02:25.850> has<00:02:26.269> a

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:33.600 
this computer ice would be larger boom

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:41.240 
this computer ice would be larger boom
but<00:03:34.600> it's<00:03:34.720> a<00:03:34.840> very<00:03:34.870> tiny<00:03:35.440> little<00:03:35.740> screen<00:03:36.330> here
