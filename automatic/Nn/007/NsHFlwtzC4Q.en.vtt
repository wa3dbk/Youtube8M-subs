hi<00:00:03.229> guys<00:00:03.409> this<00:00:03.590> is<00:00:03.649> the<00:00:03.739> little<00:00:04.399> information

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:04.640 
hi guys this is the little information

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:06.730 
hi guys this is the little information
about<00:00:05.060> the<00:00:05.149> Eagle<00:00:05.450> winder<00:00:05.839> which<00:00:06.620> is

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:06.740 
about the Eagle winder which is

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:15.340 
about the Eagle winder which is
basically<00:00:07.100> a<00:00:07.490> twist<00:00:09.130> just<00:00:10.130> know<00:00:11.230> you<00:00:12.230> have<00:00:14.350> two

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:15.350 
basically a twist just know you have two

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:18.220 
basically a twist just know you have two
features<00:00:15.710> on<00:00:15.860> this<00:00:15.950> berry<00:00:16.279> one<00:00:16.640> is<00:00:16.910> the<00:00:17.810> the

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:18.230 
features on this berry one is the the

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:19.630 
features on this berry one is the the
power<00:00:18.440> button<00:00:18.770> you<00:00:18.800> press<00:00:19.010> five<00:00:19.220> times<00:00:19.490> to

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:19.640 
power button you press five times to

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.720 
power button you press five times to
lock<00:00:19.820> the<00:00:19.970> battery<00:00:20.120> and<00:00:20.630> you<00:00:21.500> also<00:00:21.620> have<00:00:22.490> the

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:22.730 
lock the battery and you also have the

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:25.240 
lock the battery and you also have the
main<00:00:22.910> feature<00:00:23.240> which<00:00:23.570> is<00:00:23.750> the<00:00:24.470> twist<00:00:24.920> part<00:00:25.160> at

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:25.250 
main feature which is the twist part at

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:27.240 
main feature which is the twist part at
the<00:00:25.310> bottom<00:00:25.670> which<00:00:26.180> you<00:00:26.510> can<00:00:26.690> twist<00:00:26.869> from

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:27.250 
the bottom which you can twist from

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:32.470 
the bottom which you can twist from
three-point<00:00:28.250> to<00:00:28.490> all<00:00:29.390> the<00:00:29.690> way<00:00:29.779> up<00:00:30.020> to<00:00:30.789> 4.8<00:00:31.789> you

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:32.480 
three-point to all the way up to 4.8 you

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.829 
three-point to all the way up to 4.8 you
have<00:00:32.659> this<00:00:32.780> red<00:00:33.289> indicator<00:00:33.829> here<00:00:34.159> and<00:00:34.839> you

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:35.839 
have this red indicator here and you

00:00:35.839 --> 00:00:38.319 
have this red indicator here and you
twist<00:00:36.230> that<00:00:36.409> along<00:00:36.679> let's<00:00:37.460> try<00:00:37.999> it<00:00:38.059> on<00:00:38.269> the

00:00:38.319 --> 00:00:38.329 
twist that along let's try it on the

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:40.419 
twist that along let's try it on the
lowest<00:00:38.839> setting<00:00:39.199> now<00:00:39.499> with<00:00:39.649> this<00:00:39.769> battery<00:00:40.190> you

00:00:40.419 --> 00:00:40.429 
lowest setting now with this battery you

00:00:40.429 --> 00:00:43.840 
lowest setting now with this battery you
can<00:00:40.789> use<00:00:41.420> the<00:00:41.659> higher<00:00:42.069> that<00:00:43.069> the<00:00:43.219> cartomizers

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:43.850 
can use the higher that the cartomizers

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:45.819 
can use the higher that the cartomizers
that<00:00:43.999> can<00:00:44.149> handle<00:00:44.329> more<00:00:44.690> voltage<00:00:44.899> like<00:00:45.800> this

00:00:45.819 --> 00:00:45.829 
that can handle more voltage like this

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:49.899 
that can handle more voltage like this
one<00:00:46.159> a<00:00:46.539> dual<00:00:47.539> coil<00:00:47.839> by<00:00:48.260> smoke<00:00:48.859> Tek<00:00:49.159> the

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:49.909 
one a dual coil by smoke Tek the

00:00:49.909 --> 00:00:52.989 
one a dual coil by smoke Tek the
batteries<00:00:50.239> also<00:00:50.420> vice<00:00:50.690> motek<00:00:51.489> this<00:00:52.489> has<00:00:52.729> to

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:52.999 
batteries also vice motek this has to

00:00:52.999 --> 00:00:58.029 
batteries also vice motek this has to
eating<00:00:53.299> pads<00:00:53.739> each<00:00:54.739> one<00:00:55.100> is<00:00:55.339> a<00:00:55.389> 1.5<00:00:56.389> ohm<00:00:57.039> so

00:00:58.029 --> 00:00:58.039 
eating pads each one is a 1.5 ohm so

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:01.270 
eating pads each one is a 1.5 ohm so
it's<00:00:58.219> got<00:00:58.399> a<00:00:58.549> high<00:00:58.999> resistance<00:00:59.559> and<00:01:00.559> less

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:01.280 
it's got a high resistance and less

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.950 
it's got a high resistance and less
likely<00:01:01.699> to<00:01:01.729> blow<00:01:04.449> it's<00:01:05.449> on<00:01:05.630> quite<00:01:05.930> nicely

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:05.960 
likely to blow it's on quite nicely

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.100 
likely to blow it's on quite nicely
there<00:01:06.770> you<00:01:07.369> can't<00:01:07.610> put<00:01:08.450> one<00:01:08.539> of<00:01:08.659> these<00:01:08.750> tanks

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:09.110 
there you can't put one of these tanks

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:11.950 
there you can't put one of these tanks
on<00:01:09.229> there<00:01:09.549> but<00:01:10.549> with<00:01:10.909> those<00:01:11.149> clearomizers

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:11.960 
on there but with those clearomizers

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.279 
on there but with those clearomizers
they<00:01:12.829> won't<00:01:13.189> be<00:01:13.310> able<00:01:13.430> to<00:01:13.490> handle<00:01:13.729> more<00:01:14.030> than

00:01:14.279 --> 00:01:14.289 
they won't be able to handle more than

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:17.740 
they won't be able to handle more than
roughly<00:01:15.289> 4.2<00:01:16.189> volts<00:01:16.219> before<00:01:17.180> they<00:01:17.479> start

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:17.750 
roughly 4.2 volts before they start

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.590 
roughly 4.2 volts before they start
tasting<00:01:17.990> burnt<00:01:18.700> with<00:01:19.700> this<00:01:19.880> one<00:01:20.149> you<00:01:20.390> can

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:20.600 
tasting burnt with this one you can

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.959 
tasting burnt with this one you can
check<00:01:21.229> it<00:01:21.409> right<00:01:21.590> up<00:01:21.770> to<00:01:21.799> 4.8<00:01:22.520> and<00:01:22.729> you'll<00:01:22.850> be

00:01:22.959 --> 00:01:22.969 
check it right up to 4.8 and you'll be

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:26.080 
check it right up to 4.8 and you'll be
fine<00:01:23.680> I've<00:01:24.680> already<00:01:24.829> added<00:01:25.189> some<00:01:25.280> liquid<00:01:25.820> so

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.090 
fine I've already added some liquid so

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:27.849 
fine I've already added some liquid so
let's<00:01:26.390> try<00:01:26.600> it<00:01:26.659> on<00:01:26.750> the<00:01:26.930> lowest<00:01:27.170> setting<00:01:27.469> which

00:01:27.849 --> 00:01:27.859 
let's try it on the lowest setting which

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:31.929 
let's try it on the lowest setting which
is<00:01:27.890> 3.2<00:01:29.679> you<00:01:30.679> won't<00:01:30.829> hear<00:01:30.979> it<00:01:31.100> crack<00:01:31.399> crackle

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:31.939 
is 3.2 you won't hear it crack crackle

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:40.539 
is 3.2 you won't hear it crack crackle
or<00:01:32.119> anything<00:01:38.560> it<00:01:39.560> provides<00:01:40.009> pretty<00:01:40.310> good

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:40.549 
or anything it provides pretty good

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:44.620 
or anything it provides pretty good
smoke<00:01:40.820> even<00:01:40.969> at<00:01:41.240> 3.2<00:01:42.820> but<00:01:43.820> it<00:01:44.179> really<00:01:44.390> goes

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:44.630 
smoke even at 3.2 but it really goes

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:46.209 
smoke even at 3.2 but it really goes
into<00:01:44.960> its<00:01:45.079> own<00:01:45.200> when<00:01:45.380> you<00:01:45.439> take<00:01:45.649> it<00:01:45.799> up<00:01:45.920> so

00:01:46.209 --> 00:01:46.219 
into its own when you take it up so

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:57.249 
into its own when you take it up so
let's<00:01:46.369> try<00:01:46.549> out<00:01:46.700> four<00:01:47.090> volts

00:01:57.249 --> 00:01:57.259 

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:14.229 

and<00:01:58.259> now<00:01:59.189> at<00:01:59.929> 4.8<00:02:00.929> volts<00:02:02.960> that's<00:02:03.960> the<00:02:04.229> maximum

00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:14.239 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:18.410 

so<00:02:15.239> provides<00:02:15.959> really<00:02:16.380> good<00:02:16.440> vapor<00:02:17.420> partly

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
so provides really good vapor partly

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.979 
so provides really good vapor partly
down<00:02:18.540> to<00:02:18.750> the<00:02:18.870> Joule<00:02:19.110> call<00:02:19.380> cartomizer

00:02:20.979 --> 00:02:20.989 
down to the Joule call cartomizer

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:24.110 
down to the Joule call cartomizer
because<00:02:21.989> it's<00:02:22.170> only<00:02:22.379> as<00:02:22.680> good<00:02:23.250> as<00:02:23.430> what<00:02:24.090> you

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
because it's only as good as what you

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:30.020 
because it's only as good as what you
put<00:02:24.239> on<00:02:24.569> it<00:02:26.060> but<00:02:27.060> the<00:02:27.150> voltage<00:02:28.670> change<00:02:29.670> is<00:02:29.849> very

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
put on it but the voltage change is very

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.789 
put on it but the voltage change is very
good<00:02:30.360> so<00:02:30.599> you<00:02:31.019> can<00:02:31.290> adjust<00:02:32.220> your<00:02:32.310> sweet<00:02:32.700> spot

00:02:33.789 --> 00:02:33.799 
good so you can adjust your sweet spot

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:36.229 
good so you can adjust your sweet spot
depending<00:02:34.799> on<00:02:34.890> your<00:02:35.010> cartomizer<00:02:35.489> atomizer

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:36.239 
depending on your cartomizer atomizer

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:41.660 
depending on your cartomizer atomizer
they<00:02:36.480> use<00:02:37.069> with<00:02:38.069> these<00:02:38.549> fuel<00:02:39.510> corals<00:02:40.489> you<00:02:41.489> can

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
they use with these fuel corals you can

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.309 
they use with these fuel corals you can
easily<00:02:41.849> burn<00:02:42.239> these<00:02:42.569> if<00:02:42.750> you<00:02:42.870> haven't<00:02:43.140> filled

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319 
easily burn these if you haven't filled

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:44.059 
easily burn these if you haven't filled
them<00:02:43.470> properly

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:44.069 
them properly

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:48.680 
them properly
they'll<00:02:44.640> take<00:02:44.790> about<00:02:45.030> 1.6<00:02:45.569> million<00:02:47.390> you<00:02:48.390> can

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
they'll take about 1.6 million you can

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.680 
they'll take about 1.6 million you can
get<00:02:48.959> these<00:02:49.340> clear<00:02:50.340> ones<00:02:50.640> where<00:02:51.360> you<00:02:51.420> can<00:02:51.480> see

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
get these clear ones where you can see

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:54.470 
get these clear ones where you can see
exactly<00:02:51.720> how<00:02:52.230> much<00:02:52.319> you've<00:02:52.500> filled<00:02:52.709> up<00:02:53.060> but<00:02:54.060> if

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
exactly how much you've filled up but if

liquid<00:02:59.069> till<00:02:59.220> it<00:02:59.310> drips<00:02:59.519> out<00:02:59.639> the<00:02:59.790> bottom

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
liquid till it drips out the bottom

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:01.370 
liquid till it drips out the bottom
gonna<00:03:00.269> new<00:03:00.329> just<00:03:00.569> clear<00:03:00.780> it<00:03:00.810> out<00:03:01.019> which<00:03:01.230> is

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380 
gonna new just clear it out which is

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:03.129 
gonna new just clear it out which is
fine<00:03:01.410> this<00:03:01.769> one's<00:03:01.950> actually<00:03:02.100> been<00:03:02.370> washed

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:03.139 
fine this one's actually been washed

00:03:03.139 --> 00:03:07.129 
fine this one's actually been washed
this<00:03:04.139> one's<00:03:04.410> two<00:03:04.980> weeks<00:03:05.190> old<00:03:05.430> this<00:03:06.239> dual<00:03:06.930> core

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:07.139 
this one's two weeks old this dual core

00:03:07.139 --> 00:03:10.729 
this one's two weeks old this dual core
so<00:03:08.069> it<00:03:08.700> works<00:03:08.940> pretty<00:03:09.150> good<00:03:09.440> even<00:03:10.440> though<00:03:10.590> it's

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:10.739 
so it works pretty good even though it's

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:14.300 
so it works pretty good even though it's
old<00:03:10.920> and<00:03:11.780> that's<00:03:12.780> basically<00:03:13.769> it<00:03:14.010> that's<00:03:14.160> a

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
old and that's basically it that's a

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:17.390 
old and that's basically it that's a
smoke<00:03:14.579> tick<00:03:14.790> winder<00:03:15.620> which<00:03:16.620> is<00:03:16.799> like<00:03:17.010> an<00:03:17.130> eager

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
smoke tick winder which is like an eager

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:21.229 
smoke tick winder which is like an eager
twist<00:03:17.730> you<00:03:18.569> can<00:03:18.750> stick<00:03:19.019> an<00:03:19.139> ego<00:03:20.150> connector<00:03:21.150> on

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:21.239 
twist you can stick an ego connector on

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:21.440 
twist you can stick an ego connector on
it

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:35.620 
or a 5-10 like I have there and change
the<00:03:25.319> voltage<00:03:25.470> as<00:03:26.160> you<00:03:26.310> please
