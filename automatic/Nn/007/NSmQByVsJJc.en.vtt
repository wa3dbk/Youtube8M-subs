00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
to go ahead and change the folder

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.969 
to go ahead and change the folder
animation<00:01:52.650> to<00:01:53.030> not<00:01:54.030> fade<00:01:54.390> spin<00:01:55.049> not<00:01:55.470> spin<00:01:55.770> fat

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
animation to not fade spin not spin fat

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.190 
animation to not fade spin not spin fat
down<00:01:56.250> and<00:01:56.549> up<00:01:56.700> so<00:01:57.479> let's<00:01:57.659> go<00:01:57.750> ahead<00:01:57.780> and<00:01:58.020> do

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
down and up so let's go ahead and do

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.660 
down and up so let's go ahead and do
that<00:01:58.229> down<00:01:58.560> and<00:01:58.829> up<00:01:58.920> for<00:01:59.130> both<00:01:59.310> of<00:01:59.490> them<00:01:59.610> and

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
that down and up for both of them and

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.280 
that down and up for both of them and
we're<00:01:59.880> going<00:02:00.030> to<00:02:00.090> see<00:02:00.210> how<00:02:00.360> that<00:02:00.540> looks<00:02:00.570> this

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
we're going to see how that looks this

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.370 
we're going to see how that looks this
little<00:02:01.560> I'm<00:02:01.829> red<00:02:02.340> delete<00:02:03.170> and<00:02:04.170> when<00:02:04.290> you're

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
little I'm red delete and when you're

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.950 
little I'm red delete and when you're
touching<00:02:04.590> you<00:02:04.860> hold<00:02:05.180> the<00:02:06.180> apps<00:02:06.390> that<00:02:06.600> I'll<00:02:06.840> be

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
touching you hold the apps that I'll be

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.810 
touching you hold the apps that I'll be
able<00:02:06.990> to<00:02:07.170> DD<00:02:07.500> the<00:02:07.649> X<00:02:07.860> is<00:02:08.070> not<00:02:08.250> black<00:02:08.549> anymore

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:08.820 
able to DD the X is not black anymore

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:10.910 
able to DD the X is not black anymore
it's<00:02:09.239> red<00:02:09.570> so<00:02:09.780> that's<00:02:09.959> basically<00:02:10.140> just<00:02:10.709> that

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
it's red so that's basically just that

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.770 
it's red so that's basically just that
simple<00:02:11.220> sentence<00:02:11.730> that<00:02:11.940> what<00:02:12.180> that<00:02:12.360> is<00:02:12.420> for

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
simple sentence that what that is for

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.470 
simple sentence that what that is for
and<00:02:13.019> after<00:02:13.560> you<00:02:13.680> finish<00:02:14.010> any<00:02:14.519> animation<00:02:15.269> that

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
and after you finish any animation that

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.539 
and after you finish any animation that
you're<00:02:15.720> invoking<00:02:16.110> you<00:02:16.440> have<00:02:16.650> to<00:02:16.799> respring<00:02:17.340> if

00:02:17.539 --> 00:02:17.549 
you're invoking you have to respring if

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:19.460 
you're invoking you have to respring if
you<00:02:17.970> change<00:02:18.329> I<00:02:18.480> think<00:02:18.720> of<00:02:18.840> your<00:02:18.959> change<00:02:19.290> in

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
you change I think of your change in

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:20.820 
you change I think of your change in
your<00:02:19.590> springboard<00:02:20.190> icon

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830 
your springboard icon

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:22.620 
your springboard icon
Rose<00:02:21.280> you<00:02:21.490> don't<00:02:21.670> have<00:02:21.820> to<00:02:21.970> be<00:02:22.090> spring<00:02:22.330> but<00:02:22.540> if

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
Rose you don't have to be spring but if

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:24.560 
Rose you don't have to be spring but if
you<00:02:22.690> do<00:02:22.870> animations<00:02:23.560> you<00:02:23.710> have<00:02:23.890> to<00:02:24.070> be<00:02:24.220> spring

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:24.570 
you do animations you have to be spring

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:27.540 
you do animations you have to be spring
so<00:02:25.570> now<00:02:25.690> my<00:02:25.900> device<00:02:26.260> respring<00:02:26.980> let's<00:02:27.220> just<00:02:27.370> go

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550 
so now my device respring let's just go

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:29.550 
so now my device respring let's just go
ahead<00:02:27.670> and<00:02:27.850> check<00:02:28.270> out<00:02:28.510> you<00:02:28.900> guys<00:02:29.020> can<00:02:29.290> see<00:02:29.320> my

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
ahead and check out you guys can see my

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.430 
ahead and check out you guys can see my
doc<00:02:29.920> is<00:02:30.190> actually<00:02:30.820> hidden<00:02:31.210> now<00:02:31.540> because<00:02:32.320> I

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
doc is actually hidden now because I

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.260 
doc is actually hidden now because I

selected that settings and you can see

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:36.930 
selected that settings and you can see
my<00:02:34.300> folder<00:02:34.990> is<00:02:35.140> going<00:02:35.710> back<00:02:35.980> up<00:02:36.220> and<00:02:36.520> down<00:02:36.610> if

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
my folder is going back up and down if

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:38.520 
my folder is going back up and down if
you<00:02:37.060> want<00:02:37.180> to<00:02:37.300> call<00:02:37.480> it<00:02:37.510> I<00:02:37.780> back<00:02:38.020> and<00:02:38.260> forth

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530
