00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:07.330 
pounds but as I say if you think even

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:08.969

the<00:01:07.780> price<00:01:07.990> of<00:01:08.170> the<00:01:08.259> new<00:01:08.290> one<00:01:08.560> is<00:01:08.710> very<00:01:08.920> very

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:10.960 
good indeed and I think really when

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:12.870 
good indeed and I think really when
you're<00:01:11.140> upgrading<00:01:11.350> to<00:01:11.920> a<00:01:11.950> longer<00:01:12.310> lens<00:01:12.460> if

this<00:01:40.150> is<00:01:40.300> an<00:01:40.420> EFS<00:01:40.840> lens<00:01:41.170> so<00:01:41.710> it's<00:01:41.830> designed<00:01:41.950> to

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:42.250 
this is an EFS lens so it's designed to

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:43.980 
this is an EFS lens so it's designed to
work<00:01:42.400> specifically<00:01:42.970> with<00:01:43.060> the<00:01:43.360> crop<00:01:43.570> sensor

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:43.990 
work specifically with the crop sensor

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:47.610 
work specifically with the crop sensor
bodies<00:01:44.549> and<00:01:45.549> so<00:01:45.909> it's<00:01:46.570> 35<00:01:47.170> millimeter

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:47.620 
bodies and so it's 35 millimeter

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:49.230 
bodies and so it's 35 millimeter
equivalent<00:01:47.920> room.you<00:01:48.340> times<00:01:48.729> by<00:01:48.880> one<00:01:49.060> and<00:01:49.210> a

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:49.240 
equivalent room.you times by one and a

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:54.210 
equivalent room.you times by one and a
half<00:01:49.450> is<00:01:49.780> more<00:01:50.350> like<00:01:50.530> 75<00:01:52.140> -<00:01:53.140> what<00:01:53.920> that<00:01:54.100> would

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:54.220 
half is more like 75 - what that would

00:01:54.220 --> 00:02:00.300 
half is more like 75 - what that would
be<00:01:54.370> one<00:01:55.150> two<00:01:55.330> five<00:01:56.790> 375<00:01:58.080> lens<00:01:59.080> and<00:01:59.440> so<00:02:00.070> it<00:02:00.159> gives

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:00.310 
be one two five 375 lens and so it gives

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:03.899 
be one two five 375 lens and so it gives
you<00:02:00.369> plenty<00:02:00.610> of<00:02:00.760> reach<00:02:01.590> see<00:02:02.590> the<00:02:02.740> zoom<00:02:03.729> action

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:03.909 
you plenty of reach see the zoom action

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:07.530 
you plenty of reach see the zoom action
there<00:02:04.330> and<00:02:05.229> it's<00:02:05.409> an<00:02:05.530> is<00:02:05.950> lens<00:02:06.310> again<00:02:06.880> so<00:02:07.330> what

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:07.540 
there and it's an is lens again so what

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:09.029 
there and it's an is lens again so what
that<00:02:07.659> means<00:02:07.900> is<00:02:08.110> there's<00:02:08.590> these<00:02:08.739> magic

00:02:09.029 --> 00:02:09.039 
that means is there's these magic

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:11.220 
that means is there's these magic
electronics<00:02:09.549> inside<00:02:09.909> that<00:02:10.659> move<00:02:10.899> the<00:02:11.080> lens

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
electronics inside that move the lens

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:14.009 
electronics inside that move the lens
element<00:02:11.709> around<00:02:12.069> keep<00:02:12.549> you<00:02:12.700> steady<00:02:12.909> very<00:02:13.720> very

00:02:14.009 --> 00:02:14.019 
element around keep you steady very very

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:15.149 
element around keep you steady very very
important<00:02:14.379> when<00:02:14.439> you're<00:02:14.560> hand-holding

00:02:15.149 --> 00:02:15.159 
important when you're hand-holding

00:02:15.159 --> 00:02:16.589 
important when you're hand-holding
especially<00:02:15.760> in<00:02:15.849> the<00:02:15.909> lens<00:02:16.090> like<00:02:16.239> this<00:02:16.269> which

00:02:16.589 --> 00:02:16.599 
especially in the lens like this which

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:18.479 
especially in the lens like this which
is<00:02:16.629> a<00:02:16.870> variable<00:02:17.230> aperture<00:02:17.439> so<00:02:18.220> what<00:02:18.370> that

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:18.489 
is a variable aperture so what that

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:20.940 
is a variable aperture so what that
means<00:02:18.670> is<00:02:18.790> as<00:02:18.909> you're<00:02:19.120> zooming<00:02:19.569> out<00:02:19.950> the

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
means is as you're zooming out the

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:22.440 
means is as you're zooming out the
effective<00:02:21.340> apertures<00:02:21.700> get<00:02:21.909> smaller<00:02:22.299> so

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
effective apertures get smaller so

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:25.680 
effective apertures get smaller so
letting<00:02:23.140> in<00:02:23.230> light<00:02:23.530> less<00:02:23.860> light<00:02:24.630> so<00:02:25.630> you

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
letting in light less light so you

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:28.080 
letting in light less light so you
cameras<00:02:26.110> to<00:02:26.260> use<00:02:26.380> longer<00:02:26.620> shutter<00:02:26.890> speeds

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
cameras to use longer shutter speeds

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:30.479 
cameras to use longer shutter speeds
and<00:02:28.870> the<00:02:28.989> is<00:02:29.230> look<00:02:29.590> gives<00:02:29.800> you<00:02:29.950> between<00:02:30.160> two

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:30.489 
and the is look gives you between two

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:32.520 
and the is look gives you between two
and<00:02:30.670> three<00:02:30.730> stops<00:02:31.330> have<00:02:31.720> advantage<00:02:32.260> so<00:02:32.410> what

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
and three stops have advantage so what

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:34.710 
and three stops have advantage so what
that<00:02:32.650> means<00:02:32.830> is<00:02:32.950> if<00:02:33.819> you're<00:02:34.060> snore<00:02:34.420> Mele<00:02:34.569> with

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
that means is if you're snore Mele with

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.240 
that means is if you're snore Mele with
something<00:02:34.989> like<00:02:35.080> this<00:02:35.200> if<00:02:35.380> you're<00:02:35.530> at<00:02:35.620> 250

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
something like this if you're at 250

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:39.000 
something like this if you're at 250
like<00:02:37.030> that<00:02:37.239> the<00:02:37.989> fastest<00:02:38.440> you<00:02:38.560> could<00:02:38.709> normally

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
like that the fastest you could normally

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:42.150 
like that the fastest you could normally
shoot<00:02:39.280> handheld<00:02:39.700> would<00:02:40.480> be<00:02:40.690> a<00:02:40.980> 250th<00:02:41.980> of<00:02:42.040> a

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.160 
shoot handheld would be a 250th of a

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.140 
shoot handheld would be a 250th of a
second<00:02:42.959> luckier<00:02:43.959> if<00:02:44.200> you<00:02:44.349> were<00:02:44.440> really<00:02:44.800> good

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
second luckier if you were really good

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.750 
second luckier if you were really good
more<00:02:46.150> like<00:02:46.330> a<00:02:46.360> 500<00:02:46.989> second<00:02:47.470> to<00:02:47.530> be<00:02:47.650> honest<00:02:47.860> but

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
more like a 500 second to be honest but

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:51.150 
more like a 500 second to be honest but
if<00:02:49.450> we<00:02:49.630> if<00:02:49.900> we<00:02:50.019> say<00:02:50.140> it<00:02:50.200> was<00:02:50.290> 250<00:02:50.800> the<00:02:50.890> second

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.160 
if we if we say it was 250 the second

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.870 
if we if we say it was 250 the second
with<00:02:51.280> you<00:02:51.370> is<00:02:51.489> on<00:02:52.170> what<00:02:53.170> that<00:02:53.319> would<00:02:53.470> then<00:02:53.620> mean

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
with you is on what that would then mean

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.640 
with you is on what that would then mean
is<00:02:54.880> that<00:02:55.060> you<00:02:55.239> could<00:02:55.450> shoot<00:02:55.660> if<00:02:55.900> we<00:02:56.260> said<00:02:56.530> it

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
is that you could shoot if we said it

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:59.550 
is that you could shoot if we said it
was<00:02:56.709> two<00:02:56.950> stops<00:02:57.220> advantage<00:02:57.700> instead<00:02:58.390> of<00:02:58.560> 250

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
was two stops advantage instead of 250

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.039 
was two stops advantage instead of 250
of<00:02:59.769> a<00:02:59.830> second<00:03:00.190> it<00:03:00.640> would<00:03:00.880> go<00:03:01.330> down<00:03:01.540> to<00:03:01.780> one

00:03:02.039 --> 00:03:02.049 
of a second it would go down to one

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:06.080 
of a second it would go down to one
125th<00:03:02.890> went<00:03:03.489> down<00:03:03.700> again<00:03:03.970> to<00:03:04.840> about<00:03:05.049> a<00:03:05.080> 50th<00:03:05.560> a

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
125th went down again to about a 50th a

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:10.050 
125th went down again to about a 50th a
60th<00:03:07.090> of<00:03:07.180> a<00:03:07.600> second<00:03:07.930> sorry<00:03:08.670> and<00:03:09.670> that's<00:03:09.880> how

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
60th of a second sorry and that's how

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:11.910 
60th of a second sorry and that's how
good<00:03:10.269> it<00:03:10.390> is<00:03:10.420> I<00:03:10.750> can<00:03:11.200> tell<00:03:11.350> you<00:03:11.440> it<00:03:11.560> definitely

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 
good it is I can tell you it definitely

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:13.380 
good it is I can tell you it definitely

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090 
lens as well because as you probably

well know one of the tricks to doing

nice portrait photography is not to
stick<00:03:26.739> with<00:03:26.920> your<00:03:27.010> kit<00:03:27.220> lens<00:03:27.510> but<00:03:28.510> put<00:03:28.720> on<00:03:28.840> a

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
stick with your kit lens but put on a

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:31.020 
stick with your kit lens but put on a
longer<00:03:29.319> lens<00:03:29.519> step<00:03:30.519> back

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:31.030 
longer lens step back

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:33.539 
longer lens step back
zoom<00:03:31.810> in<00:03:32.049> and<00:03:32.260> then<00:03:32.650> you<00:03:32.739> get<00:03:32.890> a<00:03:32.920> really<00:03:33.190> small

00:03:33.539 --> 00:03:33.549 
zoom in and then you get a really small

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:36.330 
zoom in and then you get a really small
depth<00:03:33.850> of<00:03:34.060> field<00:03:34.329> and<00:03:34.620> it<00:03:35.620> will<00:03:35.739> be<00:03:35.920> quite<00:03:36.310> a

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:36.340 
depth of field and it will be quite a

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:38.220 
depth of field and it will be quite a
flattering<00:03:36.910> focal<00:03:37.420> length<00:03:37.570> as<00:03:37.720> well<00:03:37.840> tends<00:03:38.109> to

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:38.230 
flattering focal length as well tends to

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:41.130 
flattering focal length as well tends to
compress<00:03:38.760> people's<00:03:39.760> features<00:03:40.690> a<00:03:40.720> little<00:03:41.019> bit

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:41.140 
compress people's features a little bit

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:43.650 
compress people's features a little bit
rather<00:03:41.350> than<00:03:41.620> expanding<00:03:42.100> them<00:03:42.299> so<00:03:43.299> it<00:03:43.390> can<00:03:43.540> be

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:43.660 
rather than expanding them so it can be

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:46.590 
rather than expanding them so it can be
very<00:03:43.989> flattering<00:03:44.620> indeed<00:03:45.459> you've<00:03:46.299> just<00:03:46.450> got

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:46.600 
very flattering indeed you've just got

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:47.970 
very flattering indeed you've just got
to<00:03:46.690> watch<00:03:46.810> out<00:03:47.019> if<00:03:47.230> you're<00:03:47.410> inside<00:03:47.739> by

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:47.980 
to watch out if you're inside by

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:49.650 
to watch out if you're inside by
basically<00:03:48.850> because<00:03:49.090> of<00:03:49.209> that<00:03:49.299> smaller

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:49.660 
basically because of that smaller

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:50.970 
basically because of that smaller
aperture<00:03:50.049> so<00:03:50.230> you<00:03:50.290> know<00:03:50.500> when<00:03:50.650> you're<00:03:50.769> zoomed

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:50.980 
aperture so you know when you're zoomed

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:53.160 
aperture so you know when you're zoomed
in<00:03:51.100> all<00:03:51.190> the<00:03:51.280> way<00:03:51.370> it's<00:03:51.489> F<00:03:51.609> 5.6<00:03:52.329> which<00:03:52.840> is<00:03:52.959> quite

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:53.170 
in all the way it's F 5.6 which is quite

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:54.420 
in all the way it's F 5.6 which is quite
tight<00:03:53.440> which<00:03:53.650> doesn't<00:03:53.859> let<00:03:53.950> in<00:03:54.069> that<00:03:54.190> much

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:54.430 
tight which doesn't let in that much

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:18.010 
if you want to do any manual focusing go

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:20.250 
if you want to do any manual focusing go
over<00:04:18.130> to<00:04:18.250> MF<00:04:18.519> and<00:04:18.820> then<00:04:19.060> you<00:04:19.150> turn<00:04:19.419> that<00:04:19.600> and<00:04:19.989> as

over to MF and then you turn that and as

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.620 
over to MF and then you turn that and as

you can see again the front element does

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:24.210 
you can see again the front element does

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:24.220 
spin around when you're focusing so a

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:26.279 
spin around when you're focusing so a

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:32.500 
focus ring is locked so you know you got

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:33.870 
focus ring is locked so you know you got
to<00:04:32.560> make<00:04:32.680> sure<00:04:32.800> you<00:04:32.919> don't<00:04:33.070> plan<00:04:33.639> all<00:04:33.820> that

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:33.880 
to make sure you don't plan all that

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:36.240 
to make sure you don't plan all that
otherwise<00:04:34.210> you'll<00:04:34.479> damage<00:04:34.660> the<00:04:34.780> camera<00:04:35.250> we

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:36.250 
otherwise you'll damage the camera we

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:38.969 
otherwise you'll damage the camera we
have<00:04:36.370> a<00:04:36.400> 58<00:04:36.849> millimeter<00:04:37.440> thread<00:04:38.440> and<00:04:38.680> as<00:04:38.830> you

00:04:38.969 --> 00:04:38.979 
have a 58 millimeter thread and as you

00:04:38.979 --> 00:04:40.180 
have a 58 millimeter thread and as you
can<00:04:39.099> see<00:04:39.159> here

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:40.190 
can see here

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:45.910 
can see here
there's<00:04:41.090> a<00:04:41.150> UV<00:04:41.870> filter<00:04:41.900> on<00:04:42.380> my<00:04:42.410> wand<00:04:44.740> the<00:04:45.740> only

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:45.920 
there's a UV filter on my wand the only

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:47.410 
there's a UV filter on my wand the only
reason<00:04:46.160> why<00:04:46.310> I've<00:04:46.400> got<00:04:46.550> UV<00:04:46.850> filter<00:04:47.120> on<00:04:47.210> it<00:04:47.330> is

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:47.420 
reason why I've got UV filter on it is

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:49.150 
reason why I've got UV filter on it is
because<00:04:47.540> it<00:04:47.720> protects<00:04:48.050> the<00:04:48.170> lens<00:04:48.350> and<00:04:48.740> it<00:04:48.980> came

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:49.160 
because it protects the lens and it came

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:51.610 
because it protects the lens and it came
with<00:04:49.220> it<00:04:49.580> on<00:04:49.790> so<00:04:50.180> I'm<00:04:50.450> just<00:04:50.480> going<00:04:50.750> to<00:04:50.840> leave<00:04:51.410> on

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:51.620 
with it on so I'm just going to leave on

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:53.290 
with it on so I'm just going to leave on
all<00:04:51.650> Ivan<00:04:52.070> or<00:04:52.220> I<00:04:52.460> personally<00:04:53.030> think<00:04:53.120> you're

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:53.300 
all Ivan or I personally think you're

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:55.840 
all Ivan or I personally think you're
probably<00:04:53.390> better<00:04:53.660> off<00:04:53.810> using<00:04:54.560> a<00:04:54.890> lens<00:04:55.460> hood<00:04:55.610> to

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:55.850 
probably better off using a lens hood to

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:57.340 
probably better off using a lens hood to
protect<00:04:55.880> the<00:04:56.210> front<00:04:56.300> of<00:04:56.480> the<00:04:56.540> lens<00:04:56.690> and<00:04:57.050> but<00:04:57.290> I

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:57.350 
protect the front of the lens and but I

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:59.290 
protect the front of the lens and but I
haven't<00:04:57.560> got<00:04:57.680> them<00:04:57.770> this<00:04:58.310> particular<00:04:58.460> camera

00:04:59.290 --> 00:04:59.300 
haven't got them this particular camera

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:01.030 
haven't got them this particular camera
yet<00:04:59.810> and<00:05:00.020> obviously<00:05:00.260> a<00:05:00.320> lens<00:05:00.530> hood<00:05:00.620> would<00:05:00.830> help

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:01.040 
yet and obviously a lens hood would help

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:04.180 
yet and obviously a lens hood would help
to<00:05:01.220> reduce<00:05:01.820> flare<00:05:02.500> I've<00:05:03.500> used<00:05:03.740> this<00:05:03.860> lens<00:05:04.100> for

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:04.190 
to reduce flare I've used this lens for

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:05.620 
to reduce flare I've used this lens for
several<00:05:04.670> weeks<00:05:04.700> now<00:05:04.910> and<00:05:05.030> I've<00:05:05.450> been

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:05.630 
several weeks now and I've been

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:07.570 
several weeks now and I've been
incredibly<00:05:06.290> impressed<00:05:06.830> with<00:05:07.010> how<00:05:07.130> sharp<00:05:07.430> it

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:07.580 
incredibly impressed with how sharp it

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:10.390 
incredibly impressed with how sharp it
is<00:05:07.700> significantly<00:05:08.420> better<00:05:08.630> than<00:05:09.410> my<00:05:09.560> old<00:05:09.710> 75

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:10.400 
is significantly better than my old 75

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:14.320 
is significantly better than my old 75
to<00:05:10.730> 309<00:05:11.480> is<00:05:11.870> version<00:05:12.790> and<00:05:13.790> I<00:05:13.850> just<00:05:14.060> think<00:05:14.210> it<00:05:14.300> is

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:14.330 
to 309 is version and I just think it is

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:15.850 
to 309 is version and I just think it is
a<00:05:14.420> very<00:05:14.720> very<00:05:14.900> sharp<00:05:15.050> lens<00:05:15.290> to<00:05:15.470> get<00:05:15.590> the<00:05:15.680> best

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:15.860 
a very very sharp lens to get the best

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:19.180 
a very very sharp lens to get the best
out<00:05:16.070> of<00:05:16.100> it<00:05:16.340> as<00:05:16.490> with<00:05:17.210> the<00:05:17.450> 18<00:05:18.140> to<00:05:18.260> 55<00:05:18.680> it

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:19.190 
out of it as with the 18 to 55 it

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:21.820 
out of it as with the 18 to 55 it
doesn't<00:05:19.490> work<00:05:19.640> best<00:05:19.940> wide<00:05:20.180> open<00:05:20.600> so<00:05:21.410> if<00:05:21.710> you

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:21.830 
doesn't work best wide open so if you

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:24.250 
doesn't work best wide open so if you
can<00:05:22.010> you<00:05:22.370> know<00:05:22.490> close<00:05:22.850> it<00:05:23.030> down<00:05:23.210> stop<00:05:23.870> or<00:05:24.050> two

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:24.260 
can you know close it down stop or two

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:28.030 
can you know close it down stop or two
so<00:05:24.980> if<00:05:25.130> you're<00:05:25.640> at<00:05:25.730> four<00:05:26.230> go<00:05:27.230> up<00:05:27.380> to<00:05:27.530> like<00:05:27.650> f/8

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:28.040 
so if you're at four go up to like f/8

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:30.130 
so if you're at four go up to like f/8
or<00:05:28.190> something<00:05:28.520> like<00:05:28.670> that<00:05:28.820> then<00:05:29.420> you'll<00:05:29.870> find

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:30.140 
or something like that then you'll find

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:31.450 
or something like that then you'll find
that<00:05:30.230> you<00:05:30.350> get<00:05:30.500> significantly<00:05:31.070> sharper

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:31.460 
that you get significantly sharper

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:33.460 
that you get significantly sharper
images<00:05:31.760> and<00:05:32.090> before<00:05:32.750> I'm<00:05:32.900> doing<00:05:33.170> which<00:05:33.290> is
