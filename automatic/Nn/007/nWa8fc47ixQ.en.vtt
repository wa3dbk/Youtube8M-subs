that<00:05:06.010> this<00:05:06.280> is<00:05:06.580> funny<00:05:06.910> but<00:05:07.300> I<00:05:07.510> was<00:05:08.020> comfortable

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:08.230 
that this is funny but I was comfortable

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:12.360 
that this is funny but I was comfortable
I<00:05:09.960> went<00:05:10.960> back<00:05:11.170> to<00:05:11.350> where<00:05:11.530> I<00:05:11.560> probably<00:05:11.950> about<00:05:12.070> 10

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:12.370

days<00:05:12.580> after<00:05:12.880> but<00:05:13.450> I<00:05:13.480> think<00:05:13.810> the<00:05:13.990> extra<00:05:14.320> lean

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:14.770

days<00:05:15.010> which<00:05:15.250> is<00:05:15.430> a<00:05:15.460> little<00:05:15.790> bit<00:05:15.880> of<00:05:16.000> lateness

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:16.830 
days which is a little bit of lateness

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:20.580 
days which is a little bit of lateness
