on an extremely important time in my
opinion<00:00:07.170> and<00:00:07.799> that<00:00:07.980> is<00:00:08.189> how<00:00:08.370> to<00:00:08.429> mentally

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880 
opinion and that is how to mentally

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.720 
opinion and that is how to mentally
overcome<00:00:09.030> a<00:00:09.690> bad<00:00:10.080> workout<00:00:10.620> now<00:00:11.280> include<00:00:11.639> a

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
overcome a bad workout now include a

overcome a bad workout now include a
link<00:00:11.940> in<00:00:12.090> the<00:00:12.210> description<00:00:12.809> to<00:00:12.990> a<00:00:13.019> video<00:00:13.380> I've

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
link in the description to a video I've

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.560 
link in the description to a video I've
had<00:00:13.679> before<00:00:13.860> on<00:00:14.400> the<00:00:14.849> most<00:00:15.030> important

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
had before on the most important

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.930 
had before on the most important
training<00:00:15.809> variable<00:00:16.560> and<00:00:16.740> that<00:00:17.250> is<00:00:17.460> mental

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
training variable and that is mental

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.540 
training variable and that is mental
focus<00:00:18.420> but<00:00:19.080> this<00:00:19.260> is<00:00:19.439> really<00:00:19.619> branching<00:00:20.310> off

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
focus but this is really branching off

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.250 
focus but this is really branching off
of<00:00:20.820> that<00:00:21.060> I'm<00:00:21.330> going<00:00:21.539> to<00:00:21.570> break<00:00:21.779> my<00:00:21.960> advice

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
of that I'm going to break my advice

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.040 
of that I'm going to break my advice
down<00:00:22.560> into<00:00:22.949> three<00:00:23.279> steps<00:00:23.550> the<00:00:24.240> first<00:00:24.570> one<00:00:24.810> is

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
down into three steps the first one is

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.529 
down into three steps the first one is
to<00:00:25.230> decide<00:00:25.619> whether<00:00:25.949> your<00:00:26.160> bad<00:00:26.430> workout<00:00:27.000> was

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
to decide whether your bad workout was

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.080 
to decide whether your bad workout was
caused<00:00:27.810> by<00:00:27.990> short-term<00:00:28.439> or<00:00:28.859> long-term

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:29.090 
caused by short-term or long-term

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:31.700 
caused by short-term or long-term
factors<00:00:30.090> and<00:00:30.390> what<00:00:30.779> I<00:00:30.810> mean<00:00:31.080> by<00:00:31.230> this<00:00:31.289> is<00:00:31.470> to

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
factors and what I mean by this is to

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.560 
factors and what I mean by this is to
look<00:00:32.040> if<00:00:32.219> you've<00:00:32.369> had<00:00:32.610> a<00:00:32.640> trend<00:00:33.180> of<00:00:33.360> bad

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
look if you've had a trend of bad

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.600 
look if you've had a trend of bad
workouts<00:00:34.110> lately<00:00:34.559> let's<00:00:35.040> say<00:00:35.190> over<00:00:35.489> the

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
workouts lately let's say over the

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.030 
workouts lately let's say over the
period<00:00:35.969> of<00:00:36.030> four<00:00:36.390> weeks<00:00:36.750> or<00:00:37.110> if<00:00:37.620> every

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
period of four weeks or if every

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.130 
period of four weeks or if every
training<00:00:38.370> cycle<00:00:39.000> seems<00:00:39.239> to<00:00:39.420> come<00:00:39.629> to<00:00:39.660> the<00:00:39.899> same

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
training cycle seems to come to the same

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.440 
training cycle seems to come to the same
conclusion<00:00:40.980> that<00:00:41.129> is<00:00:41.460> most<00:00:41.670> likely<00:00:41.820> going<00:00:42.300> to

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
conclusion that is most likely going to

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.540 
conclusion that is most likely going to
be<00:00:42.600> an<00:00:42.809> issue<00:00:43.020> of<00:00:43.350> programming<00:00:44.129> that's<00:00:44.340> where

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
be an issue of programming that's where

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.729 
be an issue of programming that's where
you<00:00:44.610> need<00:00:44.760> to<00:00:44.850> make<00:00:44.930> significant<00:00:45.930> changes<00:00:46.500> and

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
you need to make significant changes and

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.740 
you need to make significant changes and
if<00:00:47.219> you<00:00:47.340> don't<00:00:47.610> do<00:00:47.820> this<00:00:47.969> if<00:00:48.180> you<00:00:48.300> make<00:00:48.329> just

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
if you don't do this if you make just

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.900 
if you don't do this if you make just
smaller<00:00:49.050> adjustments<00:00:49.340> then<00:00:50.340> you<00:00:50.460> just<00:00:50.700> won't

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
smaller adjustments then you just won't

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.360 
smaller adjustments then you just won't
be<00:00:51.090> addressing<00:00:51.539> the<00:00:51.840> real<00:00:52.079> issue<00:00:52.469> however<00:00:52.980> on

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
be addressing the real issue however on

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.100 
be addressing the real issue however on
the<00:00:53.520> other<00:00:53.699> end<00:00:53.910> of<00:00:54.059> the<00:00:54.149> spectrum<00:00:54.420> if<00:00:54.809> you

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
the other end of the spectrum if you

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.020 
the other end of the spectrum if you
just<00:00:55.350> had<00:00:55.530> a<00:00:55.559> bad<00:00:55.890> workout<00:00:56.430> and<00:00:56.670> let's<00:00:56.879> say

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
just had a bad workout and let's say

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.939 
just had a bad workout and let's say
three<00:00:57.420> days<00:00:57.629> ago<00:00:57.809> you<00:00:57.989> had<00:00:58.230> a<00:00:58.260> great<00:00:58.620> workout

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
three days ago you had a great workout

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.459 
three days ago you had a great workout
doing<00:00:59.340> the<00:00:59.430> same<00:00:59.670> movement<00:01:00.239> then<00:01:00.989> you<00:01:01.170> don't

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
doing the same movement then you don't

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.229 
doing the same movement then you don't
want<00:01:01.710> to<00:01:01.829> make<00:01:01.949> those<00:01:02.160> substantial<00:01:02.789> changes

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
want to make those substantial changes

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:04.189 
want to make those substantial changes
and<00:01:03.420> that<00:01:03.570> can<00:01:03.629> actually<00:01:04.049> be<00:01:04.170> very

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
and that can actually be very

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.830 
and that can actually be very
problematic<00:01:04.830> if<00:01:05.460> you<00:01:05.580> do<00:01:05.790> that<00:01:06.000> so<00:01:06.390> if<00:01:06.510> it<00:01:06.630> is<00:01:06.810> a

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
problematic if you do that so if it is a

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.810 
problematic if you do that so if it is a
long-term<00:01:07.439> issue<00:01:07.650> then<00:01:08.070> this<00:01:08.220> video<00:01:08.490> can't

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
long-term issue then this video can't

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.429 
long-term issue then this video can't
really<00:01:09.150> help<00:01:09.299> you<00:01:09.450> because<00:01:09.810> that's<00:01:09.990> just<00:01:10.200> too

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
really help you because that's just too

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.560 
really help you because that's just too
in-depth<00:01:10.920> that's<00:01:11.460> going<00:01:11.729> to<00:01:11.820> be<00:01:11.939> specific<00:01:12.540> to

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
in-depth that's going to be specific to

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.870 
in-depth that's going to be specific to
the<00:01:12.750> individual<00:01:13.500> and<00:01:13.680> that's<00:01:14.220> not<00:01:14.400> something

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
the individual and that's not something

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.399 
the individual and that's not something
you<00:01:14.970> can<00:01:15.150> just<00:01:15.180> have<00:01:15.479> a<00:01:15.509> couple<00:01:15.810> quick<00:01:16.140> points

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
you can just have a couple quick points

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.590 
you can just have a couple quick points
and<00:01:16.770> then<00:01:16.920> basically<00:01:17.340> solve<00:01:17.790> it<00:01:18.030> and<00:01:18.150> move<00:01:18.299> on

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
and then basically solve it and move on

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.380 
and then basically solve it and move on
however<00:01:19.470> if<00:01:19.740> it<00:01:19.890> is<00:01:19.920> a<00:01:20.159> short-term<00:01:20.790> issue<00:01:21.060> I

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
however if it is a short-term issue I

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.660 
however if it is a short-term issue I
can<00:01:21.869> give<00:01:22.020> you<00:01:22.110> an<00:01:22.229> example<00:01:22.590> of<00:01:22.770> what<00:01:22.979> I<00:01:23.009> did<00:01:23.490> in

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
can give you an example of what I did in

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:24.620 
can give you an example of what I did in
two<00:01:24.180> steps

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
two steps

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.590 
two steps
I<00:01:24.810> recommend<00:01:25.500> first<00:01:25.950> years<00:01:26.310> my<00:01:26.520> example<00:01:27.119> here

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
I recommend first years my example here

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.010 
I recommend first years my example here
is<00:01:27.750> me<00:01:27.960> back<00:01:28.200> squatting<00:01:28.790> 525<00:01:29.790> and<00:01:30.150> what<00:01:30.840> you'll

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
is me back squatting 525 and what you'll

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.010 
is me back squatting 525 and what you'll
see<00:01:31.079> is<00:01:31.530> it's<00:01:31.770> extremely<00:01:32.520> slow<00:01:32.970> at<00:01:33.299> least<00:01:33.840> by

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
see is it's extremely slow at least by

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.719 
see is it's extremely slow at least by
my<00:01:34.259> standards<00:01:34.740> for<00:01:34.950> what<00:01:35.130> I'm<00:01:35.250> trying<00:01:35.520> to

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
my standards for what I'm trying to

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.179 
my standards for what I'm trying to
accomplish<00:01:36.030> however<00:01:36.990> this<00:01:37.200> was<00:01:37.409> just<00:01:37.650> one<00:01:37.920> day

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
accomplish however this was just one day

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:41.630 
accomplish however this was just one day
before<00:01:38.490> I<00:01:38.700> did<00:01:38.970> my<00:01:39.000> 525<00:01:39.930> times<00:01:40.320> 3<00:01:40.829> in<00:01:41.040> the

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
before I did my 525 times 3 in the

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.179 
before I did my 525 times 3 in the
challenge<00:01:42.119> video<00:01:42.390> against<00:01:42.780> Conor<00:01:43.020> Lutz<00:01:43.380> so

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
challenge video against Conor Lutz so

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.460 
challenge video against Conor Lutz so
what<00:01:44.460> changed<00:01:45.000> in<00:01:45.240> between<00:01:45.630> those<00:01:45.899> two<00:01:46.140> squat

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
what changed in between those two squat

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.980 
what changed in between those two squat
sessions<00:01:47.040> and<00:01:47.280> it<00:01:47.820> was<00:01:48.090> literally<00:01:48.360> just<00:01:48.540> as<00:01:48.840> I

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
sessions and it was literally just as I

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.840 
sessions and it was literally just as I
said<00:01:49.200> one<00:01:49.470> day<00:01:49.740> so<00:01:50.220> it's<00:01:50.340> actually<00:01:50.670> not<00:01:50.790> even

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
said one day so it's actually not even

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.230 
said one day so it's actually not even
fully<00:01:51.390> recovered<00:01:52.110> for<00:01:52.380> that<00:01:52.560> 525<00:01:53.399> times<00:01:53.700> 3<00:01:53.970> set

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
fully recovered for that 525 times 3 set

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.690 
fully recovered for that 525 times 3 set
what<00:01:54.630> actually<00:01:54.960> happened<00:01:55.320> is<00:01:55.439> that<00:01:55.560> 525<00:01:56.399> set

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
what actually happened is that 525 set

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.639 
what actually happened is that 525 set
where<00:01:56.880> I<00:01:56.939> literally<00:01:57.240> only<00:01:57.600> did<00:01:57.869> one<00:01:58.170> rep<00:01:58.409> and

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
where I literally only did one rep and

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:01.580 
where I literally only did one rep and
was<00:01:58.770> pretty<00:01:59.040> slow<00:01:59.520> that<00:02:00.270> actually<00:02:00.750> came<00:02:00.990> after

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
was pretty slow that actually came after

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.550 
was pretty slow that actually came after
the<00:02:01.740> workout<00:02:02.219> where<00:02:02.700> I<00:02:02.759> did<00:02:02.969> 505<00:02:03.750> for<00:02:04.049> 3<00:02:04.290> sets

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
the workout where I did 505 for 3 sets

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.520 
the workout where I did 505 for 3 sets
of<00:02:04.770> 3<00:02:05.130> so<00:02:05.759> what<00:02:05.939> I<00:02:05.969> did<00:02:06.299> with<00:02:06.659> this<00:02:06.840> is<00:02:06.899> I<00:02:07.200> knew<00:02:07.500> I

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
of 3 so what I did with this is I knew I

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.740 
of 3 so what I did with this is I knew I
was<00:02:07.950> still<00:02:08.190> physically<00:02:08.729> strong<00:02:09.119> enough<00:02:09.390> to<00:02:09.569> do

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
was still physically strong enough to do

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.640 
was still physically strong enough to do
525<00:02:10.590> for<00:02:11.310> at<00:02:11.520> least<00:02:11.760> a<00:02:12.000> couple<00:02:12.030> reps<00:02:12.629> probably

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
525 for at least a couple reps probably

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.890 
525 for at least a couple reps probably
set<00:02:13.799> of<00:02:13.950> three<00:02:14.189> if<00:02:14.280> I<00:02:14.430> wanted<00:02:14.760> to<00:02:14.970> so<00:02:15.629> I've

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
set of three if I wanted to so I've

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.780 
set of three if I wanted to so I've
looked<00:02:16.140> back<00:02:16.319> at<00:02:16.709> the<00:02:16.829> footage<00:02:17.069> and<00:02:17.459> I

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
looked back at the footage and I

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.000 
looked back at the footage and I
compared<00:02:18.390> what<00:02:18.810> went<00:02:19.049> wrong<00:02:19.290> what<00:02:19.680> did<00:02:19.829> i<00:02:19.950> do

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
compared what went wrong what did i do

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.880 
compared what went wrong what did i do
differently<00:02:20.549> and<00:02:21.209> I<00:02:21.480> found<00:02:21.780> out<00:02:22.019> that<00:02:22.620> I<00:02:22.680> was

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
differently and I found out that I was

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.399 
differently and I found out that I was
actually<00:02:23.040> going<00:02:23.430> down<00:02:23.579> way<00:02:24.120> slower<00:02:24.659> into<00:02:25.290> the

00:02:25.399 --> 00:02:25.409 
actually going down way slower into the

00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:27.259 
actually going down way slower into the
bottom<00:02:25.739> position<00:02:25.860> the<00:02:26.340> descent<00:02:26.790> was<00:02:27.000> just

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:27.269 
bottom position the descent was just

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:29.539 
bottom position the descent was just
slower<00:02:27.540> so<00:02:27.900> going<00:02:28.170> into<00:02:28.530> that<00:02:28.739> next<00:02:29.159> workout

00:02:29.539 --> 00:02:29.549 
slower so going into that next workout

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:31.429 
slower so going into that next workout
what<00:02:29.760> I<00:02:29.790> decided<00:02:30.209> to<00:02:30.450> do<00:02:30.599> is<00:02:30.750> I'm<00:02:30.959> just<00:02:31.230> going

00:02:31.429 --> 00:02:31.439 
what I decided to do is I'm just going

00:02:31.439 --> 00:02:33.500 
what I decided to do is I'm just going
to<00:02:31.470> focus<00:02:31.769> on<00:02:32.099> going<00:02:32.370> down<00:02:32.700> quicker<00:02:33.180> in

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
to focus on going down quicker in

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.899 
to focus on going down quicker in
getting<00:02:34.230> a<00:02:34.319> better<00:02:34.470> stretch<00:02:34.950> reflex<00:02:35.489> out<00:02:35.730> of

00:02:35.899 --> 00:02:35.909 
getting a better stretch reflex out of

00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:37.910 
getting a better stretch reflex out of
the<00:02:36.030> bottom<00:02:36.329> position<00:02:36.480> and<00:02:37.019> just<00:02:37.590> seeing<00:02:37.799> how

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
the bottom position and just seeing how

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.009 
the bottom position and just seeing how
that<00:02:38.250> works<00:02:38.459> out<00:02:38.670> seeing<00:02:39.000> what<00:02:39.120> happens<00:02:39.659> so

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:40.019 
that works out seeing what happens so

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:42.440 
that works out seeing what happens so
with<00:02:40.230> that<00:02:40.379> in<00:02:40.560> mind<00:02:40.590> the<00:02:41.010> second<00:02:41.459> step<00:02:41.730> is<00:02:41.970> to

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
with that in mind the second step is to

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.210 
with that in mind the second step is to
look<00:02:42.629> at<00:02:42.780> your<00:02:42.810> last<00:02:43.140> workout<00:02:43.560> that<00:02:43.769> went<00:02:43.950> well

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
look at your last workout that went well

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.369 
look at your last workout that went well
or<00:02:44.939> if<00:02:45.150> you<00:02:45.239> don't<00:02:45.329> have<00:02:45.480> video<00:02:45.780> of<00:02:45.840> it<00:02:46.109> just

00:02:46.369 --> 00:02:46.379 
or if you don't have video of it just

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:48.740 
or if you don't have video of it just
try<00:02:46.530> to<00:02:46.590> think<00:02:46.829> about<00:02:47.010> what<00:02:47.190> you<00:02:47.549> did<00:02:47.849> and<00:02:48.150> then

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
try to think about what you did and then

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.869 
try to think about what you did and then
compare<00:02:49.290> it<00:02:49.319> to<00:02:49.440> now<00:02:49.829> and<00:02:50.190> just<00:02:50.370> see<00:02:50.579> what<00:02:50.760> you

00:02:50.869 --> 00:02:50.879 
compare it to now and just see what you

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:53.149 
compare it to now and just see what you
did<00:02:51.090> differently<00:02:51.659> now<00:02:52.019> it's<00:02:52.560> important<00:02:52.950> in<00:02:53.040> my

00:02:53.149 --> 00:02:53.159 
did differently now it's important in my

00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:56.270 
did differently now it's important in my
opinion<00:02:53.190> to<00:02:53.700> focus<00:02:54.090> on<00:02:54.269> one<00:02:54.629> factor<00:02:55.290> one<00:02:55.950> thing

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
opinion to focus on one factor one thing

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.399 
opinion to focus on one factor one thing
that<00:02:56.459> you<00:02:56.549> can<00:02:56.760> change<00:02:57.030> because<00:02:57.690> if<00:02:57.930> you<00:02:58.049> focus

00:02:58.399 --> 00:02:58.409 
that you can change because if you focus

00:02:58.409 --> 00:03:00.770 
that you can change because if you focus
on<00:02:58.530> too<00:02:58.799> many<00:02:58.950> things<00:02:59.099> then<00:02:59.939> you'll<00:03:00.180> often<00:03:00.420> end

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
on too many things then you'll often end

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.809 
on too many things then you'll often end
up<00:03:00.870> not<00:03:01.109> being<00:03:01.139> very<00:03:01.590> confident<00:03:02.220> in<00:03:02.340> not<00:03:02.579> being

00:03:02.809 --> 00:03:02.819 
up not being very confident in not being

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:05.390 
up not being very confident in not being
able<00:03:02.909> to<00:03:03.060> focus<00:03:03.269> on<00:03:03.599> anything<00:03:03.959> and<00:03:04.409> I<00:03:04.980> say<00:03:05.159> that

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
able to focus on anything and I say that

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.640 
able to focus on anything and I say that
knowing<00:03:05.730> that<00:03:06.209> there's<00:03:06.420> always<00:03:06.750> many<00:03:07.170> factors

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
knowing that there's always many factors

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:09.440 
knowing that there's always many factors
involved<00:03:08.040> so<00:03:08.670> you<00:03:08.730> just<00:03:08.879> want<00:03:09.060> to<00:03:09.120> pick<00:03:09.299> the

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
involved so you just want to pick the

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:11.960 
involved so you just want to pick the
most<00:03:09.569> important<00:03:10.200> one<00:03:10.349> for<00:03:11.010> example<00:03:11.489> in<00:03:11.700> my

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
most important one for example in my

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:14.420 
most important one for example in my
video<00:03:12.329> where<00:03:12.599> I<00:03:12.629> squatted<00:03:13.230> 525<00:03:13.950> for<00:03:14.159> a<00:03:14.189> slow

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
video where I squatted 525 for a slow

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.879 
video where I squatted 525 for a slow
rep<00:03:14.670> my<00:03:15.209> dog<00:03:15.480> died<00:03:15.780> recently<00:03:16.379> that<00:03:16.620> caused

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:16.889 
rep my dog died recently that caused

00:03:16.889 --> 00:03:19.220 
rep my dog died recently that caused
some<00:03:17.099> stress<00:03:17.310> my<00:03:17.970> sleep<00:03:18.329> wasn't<00:03:18.780> that<00:03:18.900> good

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
some stress my sleep wasn't that good

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:21.800 
some stress my sleep wasn't that good
those<00:03:19.980> little<00:03:20.250> factors<00:03:20.819> were<00:03:21.090> involved<00:03:21.690> as

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
those little factors were involved as

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:24.530 
those little factors were involved as
well<00:03:21.989> but<00:03:22.799> all<00:03:23.129> I<00:03:23.160> did<00:03:23.459> was<00:03:23.669> focus<00:03:24.060> on<00:03:24.209> one

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
well but all I did was focus on one

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:26.150 
well but all I did was focus on one
thing<00:03:24.569> and<00:03:25.260> that<00:03:25.349> was<00:03:25.470> the<00:03:25.620> speed<00:03:25.919> of<00:03:26.040> the

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
thing and that was the speed of the

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.339 
thing and that was the speed of the
descent<00:03:26.549> that<00:03:27.030> was<00:03:27.209> always<00:03:27.540> concerned<00:03:28.109> with

00:03:28.339 --> 00:03:28.349 
descent that was always concerned with

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:30.680 
descent that was always concerned with
and<00:03:28.650> by<00:03:28.799> doing<00:03:29.129> that<00:03:29.310> I<00:03:29.699> ended<00:03:30.150> up<00:03:30.239> having<00:03:30.599> the

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
and by doing that I ended up having the

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:32.869 
and by doing that I ended up having the
most<00:03:30.870> effective<00:03:31.500> workout<00:03:31.889> afterwards<00:03:32.489> the

00:03:32.869 --> 00:03:32.879 
most effective workout afterwards the

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:34.699 
most effective workout afterwards the
last<00:03:33.150> step<00:03:33.480> after<00:03:33.930> let's<00:03:34.079> say<00:03:34.139> you<00:03:34.290> analyze<00:03:34.680> it

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
last step after let's say you analyze it

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:36.649 
last step after let's say you analyze it
you<00:03:35.010> figured<00:03:35.310> I<00:03:35.370> was<00:03:35.489> a<00:03:35.519> short-term<00:03:36.000> problem

00:03:36.649 --> 00:03:36.659 
you figured I was a short-term problem

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:38.899 
you figured I was a short-term problem
you<00:03:37.109> figured<00:03:37.440> out<00:03:37.560> one<00:03:37.859> thing<00:03:38.129> to<00:03:38.340> focus<00:03:38.519> on

00:03:38.899 --> 00:03:38.909 
you figured out one thing to focus on

00:03:38.909 --> 00:03:41.270 
you figured out one thing to focus on
then<00:03:39.720> the<00:03:39.930> last<00:03:40.109> step<00:03:40.409> is<00:03:40.709> to<00:03:40.739> realize<00:03:41.250> that

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
then the last step is to realize that

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.399 
then the last step is to realize that
you<00:03:41.519> are<00:03:41.849> as<00:03:42.120> strong<00:03:42.479> as<00:03:42.540> you<00:03:42.840> were<00:03:43.049> when<00:03:43.290> you

00:03:43.399 --> 00:03:43.409 
you are as strong as you were when you

00:03:43.409 --> 00:03:45.740 
you are as strong as you were when you
had<00:03:43.680> that<00:03:43.709> last<00:03:44.190> good<00:03:44.489> workout<00:03:44.940> you<00:03:45.209> didn't

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
had that last good workout you didn't

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:47.479 
had that last good workout you didn't
change<00:03:45.959> physiologically<00:03:46.829> from<00:03:47.099> just<00:03:47.400> a

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:47.489 
change physiologically from just a

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:49.339 
change physiologically from just a
period<00:03:47.819> of<00:03:47.849> let's<00:03:48.030> say<00:03:48.209> three<00:03:48.540> days<00:03:48.750> you

00:03:49.339 --> 00:03:49.349 
period of let's say three days you

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:51.500 
period of let's say three days you
didn't<00:03:49.560> all<00:03:49.680> of<00:03:49.739> a<00:03:49.829> sudden<00:03:50.099> get<00:03:50.250> weaker<00:03:50.669> so<00:03:51.239> now

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.510 
didn't all of a sudden get weaker so now

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:53.330 
didn't all of a sudden get weaker so now
it's<00:03:51.780> a<00:03:51.900> matter<00:03:52.139> of<00:03:52.319> just<00:03:52.680> believing<00:03:53.250> in

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
it's a matter of just believing in

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:55.580 
it's a matter of just believing in
yourself<00:03:53.729> and<00:03:53.909> still<00:03:54.629> just<00:03:54.810> going<00:03:55.019> into<00:03:55.500> that

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
yourself and still just going into that

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:57.920 
yourself and still just going into that
workout<00:03:55.979> confidently<00:03:56.790> I<00:03:57.090> like<00:03:57.540> to<00:03:57.720> watch

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 
workout confidently I like to watch

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:00.050 
workout confidently I like to watch
actually<00:03:58.199> videos<00:03:58.829> of<00:03:59.159> the<00:03:59.459> good<00:03:59.639> workouts

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
actually videos of the good workouts

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:02.240 
actually videos of the good workouts
then<00:04:00.329> before<00:04:00.900> the<00:04:01.349> next<00:04:01.650> workout<00:04:02.010> not

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250 
then before the next workout not

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:05.119 
then before the next workout not
actually<00:04:02.699> sometimes<00:04:03.150> I<00:04:03.389> do<00:04:03.720> delete<00:04:04.470> videos<00:04:04.889> of

00:04:05.119 --> 00:04:05.129 
actually sometimes I do delete videos of

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:07.550 
actually sometimes I do delete videos of
bad<00:04:05.579> workouts<00:04:06.150> if<00:04:06.419> I<00:04:06.569> don't<00:04:06.840> have<00:04:07.079> that<00:04:07.319> one

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
bad workouts if I don't have that one

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.800 
bad workouts if I don't have that one
thing<00:04:07.769> that<00:04:07.949> I<00:04:07.979> pick<00:04:08.250> up<00:04:08.400> on<00:04:08.609> or<00:04:08.790> even<00:04:09.359> after<00:04:09.780> I

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.810 
thing that I pick up on or even after I

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:11.899 
thing that I pick up on or even after I
pick<00:04:10.079> up<00:04:10.199> on<00:04:10.349> one<00:04:10.530> thing<00:04:10.560> then<00:04:11.370> I<00:04:11.400> want<00:04:11.699> to<00:04:11.760> get

00:04:11.899 --> 00:04:11.909 
pick up on one thing then I want to get

00:04:11.909 --> 00:04:13.640 
pick up on one thing then I want to get
it<00:04:12.000> out<00:04:12.120> of<00:04:12.329> my<00:04:12.479> mind<00:04:12.720> and<00:04:13.079> I<00:04:13.199> think<00:04:13.260> that's

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:13.650 
it out of my mind and I think that's

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:16.099 
it out of my mind and I think that's
extremely<00:04:14.310> important<00:04:14.970> as<00:04:15.090> well<00:04:15.329> you<00:04:15.900> want<00:04:16.049> to

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:16.109 
extremely important as well you want to

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:18.710 
extremely important as well you want to
be<00:04:16.199> as<00:04:16.349> confident<00:04:16.949> as<00:04:17.130> possible<00:04:17.159> and<00:04:18.000> be<00:04:18.570> able

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 
be as confident as possible and be able

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.779 
be as confident as possible and be able
to<00:04:18.930> go<00:04:19.380> into<00:04:19.560> that<00:04:19.829> workout<00:04:20.190> and<00:04:20.430> be<00:04:20.549> able<00:04:20.639> to

00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:20.789 
to go into that workout and be able to

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:23.060 
to go into that workout and be able to
mentally<00:04:21.299> be<00:04:21.449> motivated<00:04:22.260> to<00:04:22.740> crush<00:04:23.039> it

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:23.070 
mentally be motivated to crush it

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:24.800 
mentally be motivated to crush it
because<00:04:23.669> if<00:04:23.820> you're<00:04:23.969> thinking<00:04:24.419> negative

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:24.810 
because if you're thinking negative

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:26.659 
because if you're thinking negative
thoughts<00:04:24.840> throughout<00:04:25.440> you're<00:04:26.130> thinking<00:04:26.520> you

00:04:26.659 --> 00:04:26.669 
thoughts throughout you're thinking you

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:27.140 
thoughts throughout you're thinking you
know<00:04:26.760> home

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
know home

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:28.969 
know home
last<00:04:27.389> workout<00:04:27.780> was<00:04:27.960> bad<00:04:28.139> so<00:04:28.410> this<00:04:28.590> one's<00:04:28.830> going

00:04:28.969 --> 00:04:28.979 
last workout was bad so this one's going

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:30.530 
last workout was bad so this one's going
to<00:04:29.040> be<00:04:29.220> bad<00:04:29.430> then<00:04:29.820> that<00:04:30.000> can<00:04:30.120> actually<00:04:30.240> have<00:04:30.479> a

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:30.540 
to be bad then that can actually have a

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:32.540 
to be bad then that can actually have a
snowball<00:04:31.020> effect<00:04:31.080> and<00:04:31.500> you<00:04:31.889> just<00:04:32.070> turned<00:04:32.250> one

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:32.550 
snowball effect and you just turned one

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:34.640 
snowball effect and you just turned one
bad<00:04:32.820> workout<00:04:33.300> into<00:04:33.750> a<00:04:33.780> series<00:04:34.350> of<00:04:34.380> bad

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:34.650 
bad workout into a series of bad

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:37.340 
bad workout into a series of bad
workouts<00:04:35.040> into<00:04:35.729> a<00:04:35.759> full<00:04:36.180> long-term<00:04:36.750> problem

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:37.350 
workouts into a full long-term problem

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:39.170 
workouts into a full long-term problem
that<00:04:37.470> you<00:04:37.530> have<00:04:37.680> to<00:04:37.860> address<00:04:38.160> so<00:04:38.820> that's<00:04:39.000> why

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:39.180 
that you have to address so that's why

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:40.820 
that you have to address so that's why
it's<00:04:39.330> so<00:04:39.539> important<00:04:39.990> to<00:04:40.020> keep<00:04:40.229> everything<00:04:40.530> in

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:40.830 
it's so important to keep everything in

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:43.340 
it's so important to keep everything in
its<00:04:41.009> proper<00:04:41.430> perspective<00:04:41.610> and<00:04:42.600> I<00:04:42.900> want<00:04:43.139> to<00:04:43.229> say

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:43.350 
its proper perspective and I want to say

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:44.930 
its proper perspective and I want to say
that<00:04:43.530> it<00:04:43.680> is<00:04:43.770> very<00:04:43.919> difficult<00:04:44.430> even<00:04:44.610> for

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:44.940 
that it is very difficult even for

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:47.810 
that it is very difficult even for
someone<00:04:45.120> like<00:04:45.240> myself<00:04:45.570> to<00:04:46.380> be<00:04:46.410> analytical<00:04:47.340> but

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:47.820 
someone like myself to be analytical but

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:49.850 
someone like myself to be analytical but
then<00:04:48.000> not<00:04:48.150> to<00:04:48.330> be<00:04:48.449> overly<00:04:49.050> analytical<00:04:49.320> to

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:49.860 
then not to be overly analytical to

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:51.650 
then not to be overly analytical to
where<00:04:49.979> I<00:04:50.009> just<00:04:50.220> drive<00:04:50.400> myself<00:04:50.820> crazy<00:04:51.120> and<00:04:51.509> make

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:51.660 
where I just drive myself crazy and make

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:53.330 
where I just drive myself crazy and make
small<00:04:52.050> issues<00:04:52.500> bigger<00:04:52.770> than<00:04:53.039> they<00:04:53.160> actually

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:53.340 
small issues bigger than they actually

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:55.850 
small issues bigger than they actually
are<00:04:53.660> so<00:04:54.660> that's<00:04:54.900> why<00:04:55.110> I<00:04:55.139> really<00:04:55.410> have<00:04:55.650> to<00:04:55.770> have

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:55.860 
are so that's why I really have to have

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:57.980 
are so that's why I really have to have
a<00:04:55.889> balance<00:04:56.460> there<00:04:56.729> and<00:04:57.270> in<00:04:57.570> the<00:04:57.660> end<00:04:57.810> of<00:04:57.930> the

00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:57.990
