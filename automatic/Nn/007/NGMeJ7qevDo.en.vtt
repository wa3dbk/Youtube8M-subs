00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 hi friends, i 'm spil and welcome 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.839
 good movie corner this time 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:10.050
 I'm going to bring a typical Spanish omelette 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:15.660
 a potato omelette the ingredients or 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:19.109
 the next potato egg salt oil and 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:21.029
 key onion as you see I 'm already in 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:24.150
 the process 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:27.510
 I already have the onion and to slice and 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:30.570
 tania something very chiquitita that does not 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.520
 I'm doing great and although there taste 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.160
 the potatoes are also many people that the 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:38.129
 they put very large pieces to me I do not 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.770
 I like that but I like it from anyone 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.410
 I will grant senses to show you 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:47.380
 how do i do it 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:51.850
 and like the potato - cut on both sides and 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:51.850
 the rather small rubber 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:01:00.699
 and then it ended and I told myself it's a 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:03.370
 cut and it hurts to the avalanche down call 

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:08.040
 poquita controls subject still the hairline the 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:10.360
 bitch between that I burned the cut we go 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:18.400
 the skin 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:23.100
 as my hair says big if I 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:23.100
 the nightmare of the onion and I 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:38.810
 Well I already have the chips already peeled 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.810
 let's win now I'm going to this nasal 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.509
 I'm going to remove 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:55.820
 and I do not have water or what I need 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:02:01.830
 just again and we're going what silver 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:05.870
 potato and onion is made up of 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:10.960
 put oil we will not go casting 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:10.960
 and even warm so do not ride or 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:21.910
 let's also incorporate the onion 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:24.360
 and we want the onions potatoes 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:24.360
 potatoes 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:29.060
 and meanwhile we are going to beat the 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:31.510
 bones 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:34.550
 of the tortilla we're going to let it be done 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:36.680
 when it's done because we're going with the 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:39.310
 tortilla friends we already have the potatoes is 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:43.430
 and what we give to continuation 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:45.590
 and beating the eggs 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:47.350
 I 'm going to be four for now 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:49.660
 they are big 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:54.360
 I think because I like the 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:54.360
 very juicy tortilla that I need 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:01.590
 I have a love 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:01.590
 we started to beat 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:15.500
 and once we have it beaten 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:18.350
 this is a gene who wants to do it 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:20.000
 I usually do the tortilla 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:22.100
 forever 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.280
 in fact 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:26.880
 a trickle of lesson so that for 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:30.200
 be more played 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:33.200
 I will teach the child worker that 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:33.200
 works 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:47.950
 and throwing potatoes 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:56.470
 with onions and onions 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:03.019
 white could you also tell me what 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:05.980
 Wii was and tortilla potatoes 

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:10.099
 he can pepper you 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:12.430
 Great malt happens that clear 10 

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:15.590
 for me alone we go the whole thing 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:17.539
 but since I do not like them all 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:21.500
 peppers the chorizos in the tortillas 

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:24.410
 Shred the Goth with onions and potatoes 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:26.900
 well we have the non-stick pan 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:30.400
 please that we have but the 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:30.400
 tortillas that are left after 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:33.880
 incorporating 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:40.770
 I'm going 

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:54.590
 and what I do is mold the very well 

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:54.590
 because to me I am very bad 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:59.660
 I like the tortilla, how beautiful 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:05.520
 do not put a lot of fire on it so that we 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:07.560
 come out the bottom because to give 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:10.490
 account that has to be done below 

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:13.080
 well we have to turn it around 

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:17.129
 I'm going to use a plate 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:20.899
 for where the turn and after 

00:05:17.129 --> 00:05:20.899
 although you are well matched 

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:29.480
 and then we'll turn them around again 

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:32.190
 that will be made a friend as you see 

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:35.610
 the tortilla dances lose weight t 

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:37.910
 and that means that hopefully not 

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:44.300

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:44.300
