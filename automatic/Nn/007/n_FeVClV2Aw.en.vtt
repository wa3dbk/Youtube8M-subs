00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
 hey people like me lately this photo 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:06.270
 on instagram and I have cost 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.370
 very many of you for a look to 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.710
 asked and today he comes along with 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.820
 an evening routine and that's it 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.620
 first thing I did 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.420
 I have a foundation without 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.310
 sun protection factor used because the always 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.289
 look good even when you're with 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.350
 flash photographed and that is now 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.880
 one of essens that is the make up and 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:28.650
 I think it really lasts a long time 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:30.359
 and also goes well with it 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.980
 Next I applied concealer 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.329
 also really important if you 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.930
 even smokey eyes think about that 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.910
 dwindle 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.590
 So there really should not be any shade 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.710
 be under the eyes and open today 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.180
 you should keep well 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.680
 so that the whole holds well I have 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.600
 it would have been with a pool that it 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.870
 now it is a relatively new from 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.129
 and just test mac of the toyota and 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.850
 I just have that on my whole 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.850
 face applied 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:56.890
 and then I find it right now 

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:58.510
 This smokie as quite practical and man 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:00.339
 before that the eyebrows of 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:02.739
 eyeshadow and that's how I start you 

00:01:00.339 --> 00:01:04.269
 Why do you just use what you have 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:06.640
 So at home I have now and 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:08.200
 eyebrow brother of essens but that 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:12.210
 of course applies to everything I use 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.210
 Just take what you have at home 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.350
 okay and that's why 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:18.880
 I first made the eyebrows 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:20.320
 before I started with the rest 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.479
 I take a little bit of theater now 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:24.310
 film and touched and are hers 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:27.460
 Brothers are not helping anymore 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:29.679
 blowing so strong and now I know that 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:31.750
 from the outside bickel my car to the 

00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:33.340
 end of my eyebrows and that is 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:35.200
 now a kind of template for the 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:36.429
 little bit on the same level 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.289
 that's why I did not want that 

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:39.970
 Keep brows before getting ready 

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:41.069
 so that they know about it long 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:43.179
 become 

00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:44.500
 and then I found member shadow 

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:47.830
 and that is what I'm wearing now 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:49.569
 essays a black relativizing 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:52.810
 creamy shadow on the age of 

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:54.399
 defects and now comes over easily 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:56.319
 to offer the entire mobile 

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:58.270
 it does not have to be done at first 

00:01:56.319 --> 00:02:04.090
 the eye is so pretty 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:06.189
 of which darkened then I love 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:09.190
 yes color of essens uses that is the 

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:10.750
 color 56 hkd off and I wear now 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:12.609
 with his finger on because I find that 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:14.829
 you so most product on the lid 

00:02:12.609 --> 00:02:16.600
 can apply and I have the color 

00:02:14.829 --> 00:02:20.109
 Just want to tell me history for so long 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:21.880
 I have to report the result 

00:02:20.109 --> 00:02:23.440
 a little kid and because of me 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:25.150
 color that does not come now 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:27.190
 I wanted to drive up over a large area 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:29.049
 have just from my nix range one 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:34.690
 little black in the women together 

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:36.700
 mixed and that comes next 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:38.230
 i have forced a lidstrich and 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:39.790
 You can just do any black 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:41.260
 eyeliner or kayar take that in her 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:43.660
 At home you could have silver 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:45.190
 Pizza or something do so if it is 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:47.170
 after all, I have a catalog now 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:48.519
 just decided and then 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:50.530
 I was able to do the topic already 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:52.090
 and as you can see by that 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:54.519
 creates a really nice sharp 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:56.650
 edge and I believe without this one 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:57.819
 I would not have got it then 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:59.799
 I was able to do that a bit below 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:03.390
 So I'll finish my eyes 

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:06.540
 a little bit but there applied 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:08.069
 and then the eyelashes are present and 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:09.630
 In this case, of course, also torsten 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:11.220
 you can also false eyelashes with 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:13.200
 I think that would apply to this 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:14.190
 look really good but somehow 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.480
 is not the avoided 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:18.330
 so I now first this 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:20.580
 lascana used by israel as do 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:21.150
 I really voluminous and land myself 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:22.680
 could 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.030
 she also links them up like that 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.830
 little bit but somehow too 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:29.070
 a really nice art especially personal 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:30.209
 flight and because those dark colors are that 

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:31.590
 of course a bit too 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:33.090
 I now have one more shoot 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:36.060
 bright channel taken the complex of 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:41.190
 max factor is the color 90 and that 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:42.450
 comes to the bottom and other and so 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:44.130
 a bit glossy in the whole too 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:46.350
 I bring a hot color 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:48.300
 mixed together and that comes now 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:52.380
 just under the eyebrow and in 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:53.820
 memories will come alive next 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:56.280
 a bit brown looked that is now 

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:58.019
 one of the 2 and I think so 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:00.520
 nice so the cheap and with nice 

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:02.590
 real but off 

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:09.400
 a little bit of prosperity very much the bright one 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:10.960
 place limited edition of essens and as 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:12.940
 last but not loveless you can, of course 

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:14.320
 also something nude it beside 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:16.180
 but I still like it 

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:18.940
 to have some color on the lips 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:21.370
 and that is now over report of that 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:23.530
 let concert and then the make up was 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:24.100
 already finished we come to the 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:26.260
 moult 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:27.670
 the first thing I always water before me 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:29.470
 with my straighteners in my hair 

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:31.300
 Extermination is always heat protection 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:33.100
 use that is really super important so 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:34.870
 do not forget that and if that all 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:37.630
 then I'm dried 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:39.400
 so small waves especially so in the 

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:41.680
 tips of my hair that is really 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:43.270
 super easy so I turn that 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:45.850
 just a little bit of the 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:47.890
 face away and then created this 

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:49.810
 world then has a bit 

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:51.370
 dry shampoo on top of the hair 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:52.900
 to give a little more peace 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:54.280
 it comes from byd now and that is 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:55.930
 slightly tinted so if you have something 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:57.730
 darker hair is just like me then 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:59.190
 that really great because there is no white 

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:01.320
 film leaves 

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:02.430
 and that was it with the hair and 

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:09.840
 then I have a little mine 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:11.940
 painted nails and that was it 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:13.440
 already the whole air and the photo me 

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:15.270
 Hope he likes you for 

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:16.770
 I definitely something different and 

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:19.290
 a bit darker than me 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:20.730
 but usually that would forge 

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:22.320
 of course that fits and if you are 

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:29.490
 somehow evening wants to cover two or 

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:31.320
 so party party party small jump 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:33.450
 we are posted after the game again 

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:35.040
 at home and what was great, of course 

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:35.520
 It is super important to get off to 

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:37.620
 makeup 

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:40.080
 Do not forget that it's like that 

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:41.730
 heat protection is I can today 75 

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:43.680
 making and lead to skin blemishes 

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:47.100
 and so and I am and easy to 

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:48.540
 coconut oil and I have mine 

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:50.190
 Dirty hands before I do it 

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:54.080
 is managed will bind us 

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:54.080
 my friend had to do that 

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:04.950
 Coconut oil is superfit in particular 

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:06.840
 then when you make so much makeup 

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:08.820
 has applied as you should have done 

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:10.500
 and you can not do it then 

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:12.000
 one hundred percent down with water 

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:13.320
 but i just go there 

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.480
 with a little water in the cells 

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:17.669
 over the face and that's how it gets 

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:20.020
 the whole oil film but under and then 

00:06:17.669 --> 00:06:22.419
 are you written off very quickly 

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:24.129
 to revive a bit that is still 

00:06:22.419 --> 00:06:26.879
 the white mane eyes 

00:06:24.129 --> 00:06:26.879
 the body shop 

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.720
 and then suffered a bit and the 

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:37.070
 I have now used for the first time 

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:39.650
 So the risk of sea ​​and then 

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:41.720
 something for the lips and that is it 

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:48.110
 these special manipulated walter and 

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:50.030
 that smells so good because I like it you 

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:52.160
 but every time I go to any 

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:53.960
 a birthday party or any one 

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:55.670
 celebration wherever I was in the evening 

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:57.740
 still hungry, especially if you are so 

00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:59.600
 come back late and usually 

00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:00.950
 was accustomed to sleeping 

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:04.220
 so I'm now just yet 

00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:06.770
 something made by the afternoon so rare for 

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:08.090
 luck I had something left over and mostly 

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:09.650
 I do it so that I am with me 

00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:13.220
 the bed into the food 

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:15.500
 Everything will be put into bed in exten and 

00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:16.940
 honestly i do that relatively 

00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:19.760
 not just when I'm on our budget 

00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:21.620
 of course not then 

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:25.999
 forgot to brush my teeth and because I am one 

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:27.959
 nerd wildenloh to use dental floss 

00:07:25.999 --> 00:07:34.080
 and then I could already 

00:07:27.959 --> 00:07:36.529
 sleep well done stupid 

00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:36.529
 mirror 

00:07:37.129 --> 00:07:40.129
 ceiling 

00:07:40.199 --> 00:07:43.680
