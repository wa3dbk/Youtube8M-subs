00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.130 
a deal in the u.s. I believe with Warner
Brothers<00:01:53.650> Records<00:01:54.280> but<00:01:54.580> still<00:01:54.970> she<00:01:55.600> has<00:01:55.840> seen

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:56.140 
Brothers Records but still she has seen

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:58.649 
Brothers Records but still she has seen
success<00:01:56.380> her<00:01:56.950> album<00:01:57.430> vowels<00:01:58.030> debuted<00:01:58.510> in<00:01:58.570> the

00:01:58.649 --> 00:01:58.659 
success her album vowels debuted in the

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:01.500 
success her album vowels debuted in the
top<00:01:58.900> 30<00:01:59.380> of<00:01:59.650> the<00:01:59.770> chart<00:02:00.100> and<00:02:00.460> I<00:02:00.940> think<00:02:01.150> this<00:02:01.299> new

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:01.510 
top 30 of the chart and I think this new

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:03.810 
top 30 of the chart and I think this new
record<00:02:01.720> if<00:02:02.260> the<00:02:02.920> single<00:02:03.159> gets<00:02:03.430> a<00:02:03.520> little<00:02:03.640> bit

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:03.820 
record if the single gets a little bit

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:05.670 
record if the single gets a little bit
more<00:02:03.970> airplay<00:02:04.420> definitely<00:02:05.110> could<00:02:05.380> do

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:05.680 
more airplay definitely could do

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:08.399 
more airplay definitely could do
something<00:02:06.070> as<00:02:06.220> well<00:02:06.250> 90s<00:02:07.150> music<00:02:07.330> is<00:02:07.780> the<00:02:08.229> best

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:08.409 
something as well 90s music is the best

00:02:08.409 --> 00:02:10.380 
something as well 90s music is the best
song<00:02:08.739> on<00:02:09.009> this<00:02:09.429> album<00:02:09.640> and<00:02:09.970> that<00:02:10.060> is<00:02:10.239> that

thus<00:02:33.730> far<00:02:34.090> Carolina<00:02:34.750> is<00:02:34.930> the<00:02:34.990> track<00:02:35.320> that

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
thus far Carolina is the track that

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:37.530 
thus far Carolina is the track that
follows<00:02:35.800> immediately<00:02:35.830> after<00:02:36.790> that<00:02:37.000> one<00:02:37.210> and

follows immediately after that one and

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.150 
follows immediately after that one and
really<00:02:37.810> just<00:02:38.110> is<00:02:38.380> kind<00:02:38.590> of<00:02:38.650> a<00:02:38.740> one-two<00:02:39.130> punch

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160

tight grip that it had on me starts to

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.420 
tight grip that it had on me starts to
slip<00:03:46.930> and<00:03:47.110> the<00:03:47.230> album<00:03:47.530> takes<00:03:47.740> the<00:03:47.920> path<00:03:48.130> of<00:03:48.340> the

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:50.350 
Nomad kind of wandering into

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:52.890 
Nomad kind of wandering into
middle-of-the-road<00:03:51.100> territory<00:03:51.910> I<00:03:52.180> can't<00:03:52.690> say

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:52.900 
middle-of-the-road territory I can't say

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:55.350 
middle-of-the-road territory I can't say
that<00:03:53.110> I<00:03:53.170> feel<00:03:53.459> particularly<00:03:54.459> strong<00:03:54.940> about

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:00.820 
a single as you are the production

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:02.910 
a single as you are the production
really<00:04:01.120> outweighs<00:04:01.570> the<00:04:01.810> lyrical<00:04:02.200> message<00:04:02.650> or

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:02.920 
really outweighs the lyrical message or

especially on the single and rescue me I

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:09.030 
especially on the single and rescue me I
already<00:04:07.720> mentioned<00:04:08.050> that<00:04:08.110> 80's<00:04:08.530> vibe<00:04:08.709> and<00:04:08.950> I'm

already mentioned that 80's vibe and I'm

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.010 
already mentioned that 80's vibe and I'm
really<00:04:09.250> sensing<00:04:09.700> it<00:04:09.820> quite<00:04:10.209> strongly<00:04:10.600> in<00:04:10.810> the

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:11.020 
really sensing it quite strongly in the

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:13.170 
really sensing it quite strongly in the
latter<00:04:11.230> half<00:04:11.500> of<00:04:11.590> this<00:04:11.740> record<00:04:12.040> with<00:04:12.550> madhouse

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:13.180 
latter half of this record with madhouse

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:15.270 
latter half of this record with madhouse
being<00:04:13.570> one<00:04:13.870> of<00:04:13.900> the<00:04:14.080> only<00:04:14.260> ones<00:04:14.590> that<00:04:14.830> manages

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:15.280 
being one of the only ones that manages

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:17.580 
being one of the only ones that manages
to<00:04:15.310> stand<00:04:15.760> above<00:04:16.359> the<00:04:16.600> other<00:04:16.810> tracks<00:04:17.290> and

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:17.590 
to stand above the other tracks and

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:19.500 
to stand above the other tracks and
really<00:04:17.799> make<00:04:17.950> a<00:04:17.980> unique<00:04:18.370> identity<00:04:18.910> for<00:04:19.150> itself

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:19.510 
really make a unique identity for itself

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:21.630 
really make a unique identity for itself
it's<00:04:20.049> a<00:04:20.170> little<00:04:20.380> bit<00:04:20.500> weird<00:04:20.799> a<00:04:21.100> little<00:04:21.250> bit<00:04:21.459> out

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:21.640 
it's a little bit weird a little bit out

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:23.310 
it's a little bit weird a little bit out
there<00:04:21.670> but<00:04:22.390> it's<00:04:22.540> definitely<00:04:22.750> worth<00:04:23.200> checking

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:23.320 
there but it's definitely worth checking

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:25.440 
there but it's definitely worth checking
out<00:04:23.770> just<00:04:24.250> because<00:04:24.400> of<00:04:24.610> the<00:04:24.730> camera's<00:04:25.060> vocal

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:25.450 
out just because of the camera's vocal

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:27.000 
out just because of the camera's vocal
performance<00:04:25.930> and<00:04:26.080> the<00:04:26.170> production<00:04:26.680> on<00:04:26.770> that

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:27.010 
performance and the production on that

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:28.950 
performance and the production on that
one<00:04:27.220> it<00:04:27.370> really<00:04:27.520> makes<00:04:27.850> this<00:04:28.060> one<00:04:28.300> kind<00:04:28.810> of<00:04:28.900> a

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:28.960 
one it really makes this one kind of a

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:30.840 
one it really makes this one kind of a
creative<00:04:29.410> track<00:04:29.710> that<00:04:29.979> it<00:04:30.130> feels<00:04:30.580> quite

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:30.850 
creative track that it feels quite

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:32.790 
creative track that it feels quite
playful<00:04:31.330> at<00:04:31.450> times<00:04:31.690> but<00:04:31.990> still<00:04:32.290> it's<00:04:32.500> not<00:04:32.560> to

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:32.800 
playful at times but still it's not to

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:34.360 
playful at times but still it's not to
the<00:04:32.830> point<00:04:32.919> where<00:04:33.250> it's<00:04:33.370> silly<00:04:33.729> but

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:34.370 
the point where it's silly but

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:36.670 
the point where it's silly but
