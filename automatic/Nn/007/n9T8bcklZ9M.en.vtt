00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:06.290
 Y 

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:09.820
 or not 

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:12.820
 the juli 

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:12.820
 ah 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:21.060
 and it's snowing in my dream to go back 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:24.270
 in time over the years this feeling 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.700
 it seems real it's like going back when 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:29.189
 nothing was wrong 

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:33.000
 thrown in that portal nothing to say anything 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:36.360
 to object today everything does not matter today in 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.780
 hand you talk to me other people you talk to me 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:42.630
 from me look me in the face and stimulated my 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:45.690
 constantly changing mind the search is 

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:48.840
 eternal continues forward but today no 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:51.380
 not because I was caught in rem phase 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:55.320
 I once again felt the past with my hands 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:58.260
 strange I could feel it in that bank the 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:01.170
 same space the same site is 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.500
 snowing and when it gets cold it's the same 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.900
 park full before now it's empty 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:09.030
 moments lived frozen for years 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.520
 they make like a frozen river and 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.960
 melted between the past and the present 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.450
 threw 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.610
 my letter my only witness water after me 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:21.630
 path 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:26.090
 and water after my half-frozen road and 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.090
 melted and I 

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:41.420
 or not 

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:52.539
 m 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:59.539
 my name is Julian from there , I started then 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:02.840
 I guess a bit like everyone else to 

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:05.420
 through a third person in this 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:07.700
 case it was my older brother and so what 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:09.739
 typical, you do not listen 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:12.680
 you are listening to what he is listening to 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:15.349
 at home and you're starting to like and you 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:19.099
 is starting to copy some tapes or 

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:21.349
 cds and others a bit like that through me 

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:23.900
 older brother called my previous album 

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:26.840
 that's my soul and this is called state of 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:29.720
 mind ' rambles on me and is nothing more 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:33.470
 more than giving vent to the concerns is 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:35.690
 how translate translate everything I go 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:38.470
 learning and maturing through the 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:38.470
 life you know
