00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
and you play a sort of just like jockeys

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.740 
and you play a sort of just like jockeys
around<00:01:35.220> it<00:01:35.340> just<00:01:35.610> stands<00:01:36.030> there<00:01:36.180> you<00:01:36.630> know

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
around it just stands there you know

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.899 
around it just stands there you know
sort<00:01:36.960> of<00:01:37.110> sits<00:01:37.530> there<00:01:37.740> visitors<00:01:38.520> just<00:01:38.790> a

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
sort of sits there visitors just a

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.969 
sort of sits there visitors just a
nuisance<00:01:39.090> basically<00:01:39.720> and<00:01:39.900> if<00:01:40.380> you<00:01:40.590> you<00:01:40.950> know

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
nuisance basically and if you you know

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.190 
nuisance basically and if you you know
time<00:01:41.369> it<00:01:41.490> well<00:01:41.640> you<00:01:41.820> can<00:01:42.060> just<00:01:42.299> predict<00:01:42.869> every

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
time it well you can just predict every

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.749 
time it well you can just predict every
single<00:01:43.470> pass<00:01:43.649> that<00:01:43.890> this<00:01:44.070> player<00:01:44.310> will<00:01:44.579> make

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
single pass that this player will make

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.210 
single pass that this player will make

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.570 
from behind is normally going to cause
penalties<00:02:34.500> which<00:02:34.710> it<00:02:34.860> kind<00:02:35.070> of<00:02:35.160> sucks<00:02:35.370> but

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
penalties which it kind of sucks but

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.670 
penalties which it kind of sucks but
that's<00:02:36.000> just<00:02:36.210> the<00:02:36.330> game<00:02:36.540> that's<00:02:37.440> just<00:02:37.560> the

that's just the game that's just the

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.050 
that's just the game that's just the
game<00:02:37.830> itself<00:02:38.160> because<00:02:38.490> it<00:02:38.580> kind<00:02:38.760> of<00:02:38.850> sucks

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
game itself because it kind of sucks

game<00:03:00.390> and<00:03:00.540> now<00:03:00.810> I'm<00:03:00.959> able<00:03:01.830> to<00:03:02.459> actually

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
game and now I'm able to actually

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:05.330 
game and now I'm able to actually
maintain<00:03:03.540> a<00:03:03.810> positive<00:03:04.110> record<00:03:04.709> on<00:03:04.830> FIFA<00:03:05.130> and

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
maintain a positive record on FIFA and

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:06.890 
maintain a positive record on FIFA and
hopefully<00:03:06.150> I<00:03:06.209> should<00:03:06.420> be<00:03:06.480> able<00:03:06.570> to<00:03:06.690> do<00:03:06.780> that

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
hopefully I should be able to do that

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:07.940 
hopefully I should be able to do that
throughout<00:03:07.110> the<00:03:07.200> rest<00:03:07.380> of<00:03:07.470> the<00:03:07.560> game<00:03:07.709> but<00:03:07.830> as

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
throughout the rest of the game but as

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:09.530 
throughout the rest of the game but as
you<00:03:08.010> can<00:03:08.100> see<00:03:08.250> there<00:03:08.430> Schneiderlin<00:03:09.120> picks<00:03:09.420> up

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
you can see there Schneiderlin picks up

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:12.290 
you can see there Schneiderlin picks up
the<00:03:09.660> ball<00:03:09.690> from<00:03:10.680> two<00:03:11.010> tackles<00:03:11.370> basically<00:03:11.970> from

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:12.300 
the ball from two tackles basically from

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.120 
the ball from two tackles basically from
one<00:03:12.570> failed<00:03:12.900> tackle<00:03:13.290> and<00:03:13.470> then<00:03:13.560> you<00:03:13.830> know<00:03:13.950> just

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130 
one failed tackle and then you know just

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:15.890 
one failed tackle and then you know just
went<00:03:14.340> straight<00:03:14.550> in<00:03:14.640> front<00:03:14.850> of<00:03:14.970> one<00:03:15.120> and<00:03:15.300> it<00:03:15.660> led

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
went straight in front of one and it led

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:16.970 
went straight in front of one and it led
to<00:03:15.930> a<00:03:16.050> counter-attack<00:03:16.530> straight<00:03:16.740> away<00:03:16.920> so

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
to a counter-attack straight away so

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:18.259 
to a counter-attack straight away so
that<00:03:17.130> is<00:03:17.370> what<00:03:17.580> happened<00:03:17.880> you<00:03:17.940> know<00:03:18.030> that<00:03:18.180> is

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:18.269 
that is what happened you know that is

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:20.540 
that is what happened you know that is
basically<00:03:18.630> how<00:03:18.720> good<00:03:19.200> jockeying<00:03:19.950> is<00:03:20.160> if<00:03:20.370> you

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:20.550 
basically how good jockeying is if you

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:23.900 
basically how good jockeying is if you
one<00:03:21.450> good<00:03:21.690> jockey<00:03:22.040> between<00:03:23.040> two<00:03:23.220> players<00:03:23.580> and

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
one good jockey between two players and

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:25.240 
one good jockey between two players and
look<00:03:24.510> at<00:03:24.630> that<00:03:24.720> you<00:03:24.870> straight<00:03:25.170> through

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250 
look at that you straight through

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:27.229 
look at that you straight through
fantastic<00:03:26.250> tackle<00:03:26.550> there<00:03:26.670> from<00:03:26.820> client<00:03:27.150> and

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239 
fantastic tackle there from client and

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:29.210 
fantastic tackle there from client and
once<00:03:27.390> again<00:03:27.510> that<00:03:28.290> came<00:03:28.500> from<00:03:28.650> a<00:03:28.800> jockey<00:03:29.130> in

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
once again that came from a jockey in

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:30.800 
once again that came from a jockey in
the<00:03:29.340> first<00:03:29.519> place<00:03:29.670> and<00:03:29.940> then<00:03:30.000> client<00:03:30.390> just<00:03:30.570> you

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
the first place and then client just you

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.170 
the first place and then client just you
know<00:03:30.930> followed<00:03:31.230> the<00:03:31.320> ball<00:03:31.470> down<00:03:31.650> and<00:03:31.970> got<00:03:32.970> that

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
know followed the ball down and got that

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.720 
know followed the ball down and got that
quite<00:03:33.660> quite<00:03:33.989> away<00:03:34.230> nicely<00:03:34.440> but<00:03:34.800> and<00:03:34.980> you're

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730 
quite quite away nicely but and you're

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:36.770 
quite quite away nicely but and you're
going<00:03:35.820> to<00:03:35.880> see<00:03:36.000> a<00:03:36.030> lot<00:03:36.060> of<00:03:36.180> three<00:03:36.450> balls<00:03:36.630> on

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
going to see a lot of three balls on

going to see a lot of three balls on
this<00:03:36.870> game<00:03:37.110> and<00:03:37.290> if<00:03:37.769> they<00:03:37.950> go<00:03:38.070> over<00:03:38.280> your<00:03:38.400> head

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:38.519 
this game and if they go over your head

this game and if they go over your head
don't<00:03:38.910> panic<00:03:39.150> just<00:03:39.269> switch<00:03:39.630> to<00:03:39.660> you<00:03:39.930> right

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
don't panic just switch to you right

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:41.330 
don't panic just switch to you right
back<00:03:40.380> of<00:03:40.530> your<00:03:40.650> left<00:03:40.739> back<00:03:40.920> normally<00:03:41.310> a

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
back of your left back normally a

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.729

fastest<00:03:41.730> player<00:03:41.970> in<00:03:42.209> defense<00:03:42.870> and<00:03:43.050> you<00:03:43.650> know

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:43.739 
fastest player in defense and you know

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:45.650 
fastest player in defense and you know
just<00:03:43.920> charge<00:03:44.160> back<00:03:44.400> and<00:03:44.580> hold<00:03:44.730> LT<00:03:45.060> and<00:03:45.300> you

just charge back and hold LT and you

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:46.790 
just charge back and hold LT and you
should<00:03:45.810> be<00:03:45.959> able<00:03:46.019> to<00:03:46.170> pick<00:03:46.260> that<00:03:46.320> up<00:03:46.470> on<00:03:46.680> the

second bounced quite easily it's very

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:50.150 
second bounced quite easily it's very
very<00:03:48.420> easy<00:03:48.480> to<00:03:48.810> pick<00:03:48.989> up<00:03:49.019> and<00:03:49.380> once<00:03:49.830> again<00:03:49.950> as

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
very easy to pick up and once again as

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:51.620 
very easy to pick up and once again as
you<00:03:50.250> can<00:03:50.370> see<00:03:50.519> predicting<00:03:51.000> the<00:03:51.090> past<00:03:51.300> with<00:03:51.480> the

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:51.630 
you can see predicting the past with the

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:53.540 
you can see predicting the past with the
jockey<00:03:51.989> and<00:03:52.140> it<00:03:52.709> just<00:03:53.190> leads<00:03:53.340> to<00:03:53.459> another

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:53.550 
jockey and it just leads to another

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:55.970 
jockey and it just leads to another
counter<00:03:54.000> text<00:03:54.300> simply<00:03:54.660> straight<00:03:55.140> away<00:03:55.380> very

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 
counter text simply straight away very

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:58.280 
counter text simply straight away very
very<00:03:56.100> easy<00:03:56.340> to<00:03:56.519> do<00:03:56.640> this<00:03:56.850> and<00:03:57.090> you<00:03:57.989> know<00:03:58.080> just

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
very easy to do this and you know just

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:01.220

as<00:04:03.390> you<00:04:03.480> can<00:04:03.600> see<00:04:03.690> jockeying<00:04:04.110> straight<00:04:04.410> there

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560 
as you can see jockeying straight there

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:05.990 
as you can see jockeying straight there
from<00:04:04.590> one<00:04:04.860> yama<00:04:05.100> and<00:04:05.370> I'm<00:04:05.459> once<00:04:05.640> again<00:04:05.850> I'm

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 
from one yama and I'm once again I'm

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.699 
from one yama and I'm once again I'm
through<00:04:06.209> a<00:04:06.239> game<00:04:06.510> I<00:04:06.720> mean<00:04:07.050> this<00:04:07.170> game<00:04:07.380> was<00:04:07.560> just

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:07.709 
through a game I mean this game was just

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:09.020 
through a game I mean this game was just
incredibly<00:04:08.130> easy<00:04:08.340> because<00:04:08.670> this<00:04:08.850> guy<00:04:09.000> was

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030 
incredibly easy because this guy was

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:10.550 
incredibly easy because this guy was
very<00:04:09.300> very<00:04:09.420> predictable<00:04:09.930> if<00:04:10.049> you<00:04:10.140> but<00:04:10.320> if<00:04:10.470> you

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 
very very predictable if you but if you

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.470 
very very predictable if you but if you
come<00:04:10.709> across<00:04:10.920> a<00:04:11.040> very<00:04:11.340> predictable<00:04:11.700> person<00:04:12.180> on

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.480 
come across a very predictable person on

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:15.800 
come across a very predictable person on
the<00:04:12.630> Xbox<00:04:13.110> or<00:04:13.320> you<00:04:13.680> know<00:04:13.799> just<00:04:13.830> online<00:04:14.430> in<00:04:15.360> FIFA

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810 
the Xbox or you know just online in FIFA

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:18.050 
the Xbox or you know just online in FIFA
you<00:04:16.769> should<00:04:16.950> have<00:04:17.070> an<00:04:17.310> absolute<00:04:17.669> whale<00:04:17.820> of<00:04:18.000> a

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:18.060 
you should have an absolute whale of a

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:20.390 
you should have an absolute whale of a
time<00:04:18.180> because<00:04:18.390> this<00:04:18.780> defending<00:04:19.290> is<00:04:19.410> basically

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 
time because this defending is basically

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.370 
time because this defending is basically
all<00:04:20.580> about<00:04:21.000> predicting<00:04:21.540> because<00:04:21.840> as<00:04:22.109> soon<00:04:22.260> as

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:22.380 
all about predicting because as soon as

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:23.930 
all about predicting because as soon as
you<00:04:22.530> predict<00:04:22.860> the<00:04:23.039> path<00:04:23.190> I'll<00:04:23.400> predicted<00:04:23.820> the

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 
you predict the path I'll predicted the

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:25.850 
you predict the path I'll predicted the
movement<00:04:24.360> it's<00:04:24.539> very<00:04:25.050> very<00:04:25.289> easy<00:04:25.350> from<00:04:25.680> there
