DNT<00:00:12.059> and<00:00:12.509> in<00:00:12.630> today's<00:00:12.900> video<00:00:13.080> we're<00:00:13.349> working

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
DNT and in today's video we're working

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.189 
DNT and in today's video we're working
on<00:00:13.799> a<00:00:13.830> revolving<00:00:14.519> lighthouse<00:00:14.759> with<00:00:15.660> my<00:00:15.809> cards

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
on a revolving lighthouse with my cards

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.920 
on a revolving lighthouse with my cards
BAM<00:00:16.680> alright<00:00:17.550> so<00:00:17.820> if<00:00:17.970> you<00:00:18.090> saw<00:00:18.300> my<00:00:18.480> previous

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
BAM alright so if you saw my previous

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.990 
BAM alright so if you saw my previous
video<00:00:19.230> I<00:00:19.260> have<00:00:19.470> one<00:00:19.740> already<00:00:19.920> on<00:00:20.279> a<00:00:20.310> revolving

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
video I have one already on a revolving

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.420 
video I have one already on a revolving
lighthouse<00:00:21.240> you<00:00:22.140> know<00:00:22.500> shortly<00:00:22.859> after<00:00:23.189> I<00:00:23.250> did

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
lighthouse you know shortly after I did

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.130 
lighthouse you know shortly after I did
it<00:00:23.460> my<00:00:23.970> friend<00:00:24.210> fixes<00:00:24.539> like<00:00:24.720> hey<00:00:24.840> why<00:00:24.990> don't

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
it my friend fixes like hey why don't

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.420 
it my friend fixes like hey why don't
you<00:00:25.230> do<00:00:25.380> the<00:00:25.410> one<00:00:25.619> with<00:00:25.769> the<00:00:25.800> minecart<00:00:26.279> it's

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
you do the one with the minecart it's

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.640 
you do the one with the minecart it's
easier<00:00:26.789> than<00:00:26.910> a<00:00:26.970> clock<00:00:27.300> and<00:00:27.599> you<00:00:28.109> know<00:00:28.230> what

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
easier than a clock and you know what

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.730 
easier than a clock and you know what
not<00:00:29.119> so<00:00:30.119> basically<00:00:30.480> this<00:00:30.720> is<00:00:30.900> the<00:00:31.140> general

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
not so basically this is the general

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.090 
not so basically this is the general
concept<00:00:32.099> of<00:00:32.579> a<00:00:32.820> revolving<00:00:33.329> lighthouse

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:34.100 
concept of a revolving lighthouse

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.500 
concept of a revolving lighthouse
granted<00:00:35.100> it<00:00:35.190> can<00:00:35.309> be<00:00:35.430> expanded<00:00:35.880> it<00:00:36.210> can<00:00:36.360> be

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
granted it can be expanded it can be

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.810 
granted it can be expanded it can be
made<00:00:36.930> you<00:00:37.200> know<00:00:37.230> somewhat<00:00:37.680> smaller<00:00:37.980> but<00:00:38.610> all

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
made you know somewhat smaller but all

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.970 
made you know somewhat smaller but all
it<00:00:39.000> really<00:00:39.180> is<00:00:39.329> is<00:00:39.480> a<00:00:39.809> minecart<00:00:40.260> going<00:00:40.680> around

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
it really is is a minecart going around

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.580 
it really is is a minecart going around
over<00:00:41.820> detector<00:00:42.360> rails<00:00:42.600> on<00:00:42.930> and<00:00:43.290> you<00:00:43.410> know<00:00:43.559> just

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
over detector rails on and you know just

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.700 
over detector rails on and you know just
kind<00:00:43.980> of<00:00:44.040> keeping<00:00:44.340> up<00:00:44.520> momentum<00:00:45.500> from<00:00:46.500> there

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
kind of keeping up momentum from there

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.889 
kind of keeping up momentum from there
on<00:00:46.890> you<00:00:47.280> know<00:00:47.430> they're<00:00:47.670> just<00:00:47.700> slight<00:00:48.420> wiring

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
on you know they're just slight wiring

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.630 
on you know they're just slight wiring
depending<00:00:49.440> on<00:00:49.559> how<00:00:49.710> big<00:00:49.920> or<00:00:50.039> how<00:00:50.100> small<00:00:50.219> you

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
depending on how big or how small you

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.639 
depending on how big or how small you
make<00:00:50.850> it<00:00:51.030> then<00:00:51.180> it<00:00:51.360> would<00:00:51.840> have<00:00:51.960> to<00:00:52.079> be<00:00:52.140> you

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
make it then it would have to be you

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.680 
make it then it would have to be you
know<00:00:52.739> adjusted<00:00:53.309> for<00:00:53.489> it<00:00:53.610> so<00:00:54.270> basically<00:00:54.510> all

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
know adjusted for it so basically all

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:55.880 
know adjusted for it so basically all
we're<00:00:54.809> going<00:00:54.899> to<00:00:54.960> do<00:00:55.079> right<00:00:55.260> now<00:00:55.379> just<00:00:55.590> build

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
we're going to do right now just build

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.340 
we're going to do right now just build
this<00:00:56.399> one<00:00:56.640> it's<00:00:56.820> five<00:00:57.360> by<00:00:57.570> five<00:00:57.809> type

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
this one it's five by five type

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.450 
this one it's five by five type
situation<00:00:59.149> and<00:01:00.149> so<00:01:00.750> will<00:01:00.870> do<00:01:01.050> is<00:01:01.260> five<00:01:02.039> here

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
situation and so will do is five here

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.880 
situation and so will do is five here
skip<00:01:03.059> a<00:01:03.090> blog<00:01:03.359> five<00:01:03.690> here<00:01:04.049> and<00:01:04.260> so<00:01:04.470> on<00:01:04.619> so<00:01:04.650> i'll

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
skip a blog five here and so on so i'll

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.429 
skip a blog five here and so on so i'll
put<00:01:05.100> powered<00:01:05.400> rails<00:01:05.640> here<00:01:05.909> here<00:01:06.330> here<00:01:07.260> and

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
put powered rails here here here and

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.359 
put powered rails here here here and
here<00:01:08.780> let's<00:01:09.780> see<00:01:10.020> what<00:01:10.320> I<00:01:10.380> put<00:01:10.770> the<00:01:10.890> detector

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
here let's see what I put the detector

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:12.859 
here let's see what I put the detector
rails<00:01:11.549> and<00:01:11.729> yeah<00:01:11.850> just<00:01:12.150> right<00:01:12.299> next<00:01:12.659> to<00:01:12.720> them

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
rails and yeah just right next to them

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.899 
rails and yeah just right next to them
just<00:01:13.710> like<00:01:13.830> so<00:01:15.409> and<00:01:16.409> then<00:01:16.549> the<00:01:17.549> rest<00:01:17.700> are<00:01:17.880> just

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
just like so and then the rest are just

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:23.149 
just like so and then the rest are just
regular<00:01:18.600> tracks<00:01:19.140> pretty<00:01:20.070> much<00:01:20.540> just<00:01:21.540> that<00:01:22.159> um

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
regular tracks pretty much just that um

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.160 
regular tracks pretty much just that um
what<00:01:23.729> you'll<00:01:23.880> want<00:01:24.030> to<00:01:24.150> do<00:01:24.330> is<00:01:24.360> I'll<00:01:24.960> least

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
what you'll want to do is I'll least

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.080 
what you'll want to do is I'll least
myself<00:01:25.619> I<00:01:25.799> power<00:01:26.100> them<00:01:26.310> all<00:01:26.490> from<00:01:26.729> underneath

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
myself I power them all from underneath

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.480 
myself I power them all from underneath
I<00:01:27.450> guess<00:01:27.780> with<00:01:27.990> this<00:01:28.200> specific<00:01:28.740> scenario<00:01:29.310> like

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
I guess with this specific scenario like

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.550 
I guess with this specific scenario like
you<00:01:29.670> don't<00:01:29.820> have<00:01:29.970> to<00:01:30.180> but<00:01:30.390> what<00:01:30.960> I<00:01:30.990> would<00:01:31.140> do<00:01:31.409> is

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
you don't have to but what I would do is

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.640 
you don't have to but what I would do is
I<00:01:31.590> would<00:01:31.710> do<00:01:31.950> something<00:01:32.340> along<00:01:32.579> those<00:01:32.759> lines

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:33.650 
I would do something along those lines

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:36.080 
I would do something along those lines
what<00:01:34.650> you're<00:01:34.799> able<00:01:34.920> to<00:01:35.100> do<00:01:35.340> if<00:01:35.460> you'd<00:01:35.610> like<00:01:35.790> is

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
what you're able to do if you'd like is

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.929 
what you're able to do if you'd like is
you<00:01:37.020> know<00:01:37.140> just<00:01:37.290> simply<00:01:37.710> power<00:01:38.400> them<00:01:38.610> from<00:01:38.820> the

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
you know just simply power them from the

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.730 
you know just simply power them from the
inside<00:01:38.970> I<00:01:39.360> mean<00:01:39.600> it's<00:01:39.750> lighthouse<00:01:40.229> so<00:01:40.500> in

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
inside I mean it's lighthouse so in

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.530 
inside I mean it's lighthouse so in
theory<00:01:41.400> nobody's<00:01:41.850> going<00:01:42.000> to<00:01:42.060> really<00:01:42.270> actually

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
theory nobody's going to really actually

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.690 
theory nobody's going to really actually
see<00:01:43.020> it<00:01:43.140> so<00:01:43.409> it<00:01:43.649> won't<00:01:44.100> make<00:01:44.220> any<00:01:44.280> kind<00:01:44.579> of

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
see it so it won't make any kind of

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.760 
see it so it won't make any kind of
difference<00:01:45.229> from<00:01:46.229> their<00:01:46.409> own<00:01:46.500> you're<00:01:46.649> going

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
difference from their own you're going

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.749 
difference from their own you're going
to<00:01:46.829> throw<00:01:46.979> on<00:01:47.220> your<00:01:47.570> mine<00:01:48.570> cart<00:01:48.780> and<00:01:49.610> just<00:01:50.610> have

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
to throw on your mine cart and just have

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.490 
to throw on your mine cart and just have
it<00:01:50.880> spin<00:01:51.119> around<00:01:51.240> obviously<00:01:51.869> there's<00:01:52.320> some

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
it spin around obviously there's some

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.010 
it spin around obviously there's some
that<00:01:52.619> are<00:01:52.740> missed<00:01:52.979> if<00:01:53.189> you<00:01:53.310> can<00:01:53.430> tell<00:01:53.640> here

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:54.020 
that are missed if you can tell here

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:56.870 
that are missed if you can tell here
which<00:01:55.020> is<00:01:55.170> simply<00:01:55.380> why<00:01:55.740> in<00:01:56.100> this<00:01:56.340> case<00:01:56.579> what<00:01:56.850> I

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
which is simply why in this case what I

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.109 
which is simply why in this case what I
did<00:01:57.149> is<00:01:57.270> I<00:01:57.420> just<00:01:58.009> poke<00:01:59.009> the<00:01:59.159> hole<00:01:59.340> there<00:01:59.549> put<00:02:00.000> in

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
did is I just poke the hole there put in

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.950 
did is I just poke the hole there put in
some<00:02:00.180> um<00:02:01.640> some<00:02:02.640> redstone<00:02:02.850> dust<00:02:03.240> enabling<00:02:03.810> it

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
some um some redstone dust enabling it

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.830 
some um some redstone dust enabling it
to<00:02:03.990> power<00:02:04.530> the<00:02:04.710> rest<00:02:05.149> so<00:02:06.149> that's<00:02:06.420> pretty<00:02:06.780> much

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
to power the rest so that's pretty much

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.109 
to power the rest so that's pretty much
all<00:02:07.200> I<00:02:07.320> did<00:02:07.680> here<00:02:07.950> to<00:02:08.129> take<00:02:08.640> care<00:02:08.849> of<00:02:08.910> that

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
all I did here to take care of that

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.120 
all I did here to take care of that
issue

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130 
issue

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:17.380 
issue
like<00:02:10.610> so<00:02:10.910> like<00:02:11.840> so<00:02:11.900> like<00:02:13.270> so<00:02:15.250> and<00:02:16.250> like<00:02:16.400> so<00:02:16.670> so

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
like so like so like so and like so so

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.680 
like so like so like so and like so so
yeah<00:02:17.540> basically<00:02:17.840> just<00:02:18.230> revolves<00:02:18.770> around

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
yeah basically just revolves around

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.450 
yeah basically just revolves around
again<00:02:20.690> you're<00:02:20.990> able<00:02:21.260> to<00:02:21.440> make<00:02:21.830> it<00:02:21.980> bigger<00:02:22.160> make

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:22.460 
again you're able to make it bigger make

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:25.450 
again you're able to make it bigger make
it<00:02:22.580> smaller<00:02:22.940> and<00:02:23.720> at<00:02:24.590> the<00:02:24.710> end<00:02:24.830> of<00:02:24.890> it<00:02:25.010> you<00:02:25.340> know

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:25.460 
it smaller and at the end of it you know

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:27.460 
it smaller and at the end of it you know
this<00:02:25.640> is<00:02:25.700> it<00:02:26.030> I<00:02:26.240> believe<00:02:26.960> though<00:02:27.110> that<00:02:27.140> when

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
this is it I believe though that when

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.860 
this is it I believe though that when
you<00:02:27.560> accident<00:02:28.070> save<00:02:28.340> the<00:02:28.910> car<00:02:29.120> does<00:02:29.480> stop

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
you accident save the car does stop

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:35.200 
you accident save the car does stop
moving<00:02:32.320> in<00:02:33.460> survival<00:02:34.460> I<00:02:34.580> would<00:02:34.730> say<00:02:34.910> and

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:35.210 
moving in survival I would say and

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:36.850 
moving in survival I would say and
creative<00:02:35.690> because<00:02:35.900> yeah<00:02:36.170> when<00:02:36.320> I<00:02:36.350> popped<00:02:36.680> in

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
creative because yeah when I popped in

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:39.130 
creative because yeah when I popped in
here<00:02:37.040> the<00:02:37.250> the<00:02:37.580> card<00:02:37.820> was<00:02:38.000> stopped<00:02:38.330> so<00:02:38.990> you'll

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140 
here the the card was stopped so you'll

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:40.870 
here the the card was stopped so you'll
have<00:02:39.320> to<00:02:39.380> implement<00:02:39.710> some<00:02:40.100> kind<00:02:40.340> of<00:02:40.400> system

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:40.880 
have to implement some kind of system

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.800 
have to implement some kind of system
basically<00:02:41.090> the<00:02:41.660> to<00:02:42.080> get<00:02:42.230> it<00:02:42.350> going<00:02:42.710> again

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
basically the to get it going again

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:45.850 
basically the to get it going again
obviously<00:02:44.810> you're<00:02:44.990> just<00:02:45.020> coming<00:02:45.380> up<00:02:45.560> here<00:02:45.800> and

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:45.860 
obviously you're just coming up here and

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:50.170 
obviously you're just coming up here and
pushing<00:02:46.250> it<00:02:46.400> is<00:02:46.700> an<00:02:46.910> option<00:02:48.580> but<00:02:49.580> I<00:02:49.640> mean<00:02:49.850> given

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
pushing it is an option but I mean given

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:54.640 
pushing it is an option but I mean given
the<00:02:50.540> way<00:02:50.960> that<00:02:51.170> this<00:02:51.380> is<00:02:51.590> set<00:02:51.890> up<00:02:51.920> you<00:02:53.140> know<00:02:54.140> you

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
the way that this is set up you know you

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:56.890 
the way that this is set up you know you
have<00:02:54.860> to<00:02:55.010> just<00:02:55.190> give<00:02:55.970> it<00:02:56.090> some<00:02:56.120> momentum<00:02:56.780> I

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:56.900 
have to just give it some momentum I

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.580 
have to just give it some momentum I
honestly<00:02:57.320> I'm<00:02:57.530> not<00:02:57.740> quite<00:02:58.040> sure<00:02:58.070> if<00:02:58.520> having

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590 
honestly I'm not quite sure if having

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:02.770 
honestly I'm not quite sure if having
any<00:03:00.590> kind<00:03:00.920> of<00:03:01.100> mob<00:03:01.430> obviously<00:03:02.090> the<00:03:02.240> mob<00:03:02.420> that

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
any kind of mob obviously the mob that

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:06.550 
any kind of mob obviously the mob that
would<00:03:02.930> be<00:03:03.050> in<00:03:03.170> here<00:03:03.380> would<00:03:03.530> not<00:03:03.770> be<00:03:04.430> spawn<00:03:05.560> it's

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:06.560 
would be in here would not be spawn it's

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:08.500 
would be in here would not be spawn it's
just<00:03:06.890> how<00:03:06.980> they<00:03:07.130> work<00:03:07.370> in<00:03:07.940> general<00:03:08.330> when<00:03:08.420> it

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 
just how they work in general when it

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:10.570 
just how they work in general when it
comes<00:03:08.690> to<00:03:08.780> mind<00:03:08.960> cards<00:03:09.290> I<00:03:09.500> don't<00:03:10.070> know<00:03:10.190> if<00:03:10.310> this

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:10.580 
comes to mind cards I don't know if this

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:13.000 
comes to mind cards I don't know if this
in<00:03:10.820> particular<00:03:11.000> would<00:03:11.720> ensure<00:03:12.470> that<00:03:12.650> it<00:03:12.830> would

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010 
in particular would ensure that it would

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:15.640 
in particular would ensure that it would
not<00:03:13.250> you<00:03:14.090> know<00:03:14.210> that<00:03:14.390> it<00:03:14.510> would<00:03:14.630> not<00:03:14.660> stop

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:15.650 
not you know that it would not stop

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:18.010 
not you know that it would not stop
moving<00:03:16.070> but<00:03:16.280> obviously<00:03:16.640> it<00:03:16.820> has<00:03:17.030> a<00:03:17.270> mom<00:03:17.570> in<00:03:17.810> the

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:18.020 
moving but obviously it has a mom in the

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:20.910 
moving but obviously it has a mom in the
card<00:03:18.260> which<00:03:18.470> inherently<00:03:19.340> makes<00:03:19.760> it<00:03:20.000> go<00:03:20.150> faster

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:20.920 
card which inherently makes it go faster

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:22.960 
card which inherently makes it go faster
so<00:03:21.920> basically<00:03:22.370> you'll<00:03:22.520> have<00:03:22.640> to<00:03:22.790> toy<00:03:22.940> around

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:22.970 
so basically you'll have to toy around

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:25.270 
so basically you'll have to toy around
with<00:03:23.330> this<00:03:23.540> general<00:03:23.900> concept<00:03:24.350> but<00:03:25.040> awesome

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.280 
with this general concept but awesome

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.010 
with this general concept but awesome
