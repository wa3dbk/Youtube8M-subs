00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.500
 on 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:23.500
 that youtube I am allowed to have it 

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:25.090
 can already be a crisis year or 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:27.340
 other chains bad of the old last 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:30.099
 committee where i get my new series 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:32.619
 but I have started to come 

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:34.629
 Immediately precede me to the mega 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:37.600
 stark yellow background should be 

00:00:34.629 --> 00:00:40.120
 quad murder solo plays and still has 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:42.600
 a band amok can please what 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:43.960
 yes, rather with right heard a good 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.269
 People 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:48.579
 I will not play any more 

00:00:46.269 --> 00:00:50.649
 idea if I had god or so on 

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:53.190
 in any case, the gameplay is super crass 

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:57.399
 and respect, however, luca the player 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:01:01.269
 and jo because still say to the gameplay 

00:00:57.399 --> 00:01:04.269
 yes, that was a lok of 36 

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:05.979
 had seconds in the time that had 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:09.550
 I immediately with special of the bonus so 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:12.369
 not really crass so give up 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:14.800
 every case the edge in the background and 

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:17.350
 yes, we come directly to the category 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:21.250
 The city has indeed selected the 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:23.470
 category top three films as that goes 120 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.970
 meter away from my home 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:26.920
 I go often in the cinema 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:29.500
 So what do I call a lot of movies 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:31.210
 have already seen and you on the spot 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:34.689
 Three definitely is Transformers 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:37.180
 why was i just plain action 

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:39.460
 Dear people, that's really awesome 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:43.390
 crass and the film itself, too 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:45.430
 really well done only the only thing 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:46.960
 leave me properly and why it on 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:48.850
 nordplatz rice is that they are the two 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.729
 main characters from the first two 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:54.399
 just share it 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:56.860
 i do not understand how to megan fox out 

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:59.469
 can make a movie runner or rather 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:02.710
 How to get the main character out 

00:01:59.469 --> 00:02:05.530
 can go to the movie and then also 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:08.350
 the other main character 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:10.300
 understand that people will be if someone 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:12.340
 been there too pension in the fourth part 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:14.440
 So the lower part was the one 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:17.080
 main character still there so who if the 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:20.709
 both were still on their first day 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:21.700
 2nd place or place one was yes 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:23.110
 Of course that has me a bit 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:25.810
 that's why it's time to ask 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:26.380
 in third place and second place 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:29.050
 is 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:30.700
 you were you lead i know my thing 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:31.930
 I also appreciate each one of you 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.750
 I need to now playing 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:37.390
 Telling is after the cash registers 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:39.040
 rochester and how the duels resp 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:42.310
 how they are going against each other 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.890
 too blatant people and is definitely 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:46.450
 quite a blatant action as well 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:49.000
 is also from the second place and behind 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:51.459
 i just drive all six parts people 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.800
 not like Transformers I celebrate 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:56.970
 just one thing and that's because there too 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:56.970
 only the main roadway but 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:10.800
 Duke interview ready

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:43.900
 all six parts correctness and also 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:47.170
 deserved place because of and comes 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:50.170
 then directly to my place one 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:54.130
 should actually know everyone on 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:57.190
 in any case, it's project iks people that 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:04:00.040
 is just the first movie of the movie 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:02.710
 ever was invented and yes it goes 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:05.410
 therefore that it is now easy again it 

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:08.020
 It's about letting a young one believe me 

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:10.560
 do not know the 18 I know everyone 

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:12.790
 when he celebrates his birthday and he 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:14.530
 did not want to invite so many but 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:16.270
 his friend just costs such a 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:19.480
 exaggerated fun again has easy 

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:21.850
 all you know invited and the 

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:24.970
 party escalates in the end so you can do it 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:27.010
 Do not imagine people the whole 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:29.680
 Neighborhood so not the people now 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:36.160
 but all the houses burn and none 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:38.680
 know that kenia fits and witty 

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:41.320
 everything happens because people goes to 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:43.230
 offer so a really no bands 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:47.470
 in the pool and I just have to 

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:51.910
 laugh at the film and yes he is up 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:53.650
 each case deserves place one and the 

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:57.250
 you just have to watch the movie 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:59.260
 So please look at the and if 

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:01.690

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:03.670

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:04.960
