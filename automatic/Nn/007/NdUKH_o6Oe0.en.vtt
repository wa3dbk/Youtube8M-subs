00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
animals are grazing on that but they

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.979 
animals are grazing on that but they
still<00:00:53.610> need<00:00:53.820> some<00:00:54.480> hex<00:00:54.719> it's<00:00:55.020> not<00:00:55.170> long<00:00:55.469> enough

00:00:56.979 --> 00:00:56.989 
still need some hex it's not long enough

00:00:56.989 --> 00:00:59.540 
still need some hex it's not long enough
we<00:00:57.989> have<00:00:58.170> to<00:00:58.199> feed<00:00:58.649> out<00:00:58.800> a<00:00:58.829> lot<00:00:59.100> of<00:00:59.219> hay<00:00:59.340> during
