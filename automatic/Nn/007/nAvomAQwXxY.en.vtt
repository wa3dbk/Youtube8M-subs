00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:06.300
 it is a table with bicycle tests 

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:07.890
 does not have a steering wheel 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:09.870
 I said with the movement of the hips 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.870
 and it becomes an all-terrain vehicle 

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:16.560
 3 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.519
 It is so versatile that there are those who use it with sail to make voyages of 

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:22.210
 desert 1 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:25.210
 in Mexico there are only 20 copies 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:28.779
 at 3:15 

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:32.160
 this plan is pregnant 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.970
 the premiums will be practiced doctor now we started doing two years ago 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:40.320
 speed records established in this modality exceed 80 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.620
 kilometers per hour 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:45.550
 basically combines the best of the skateboard with the bike download the 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:48.770
 bicycle on the sidewalk of the street 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:51.030
 besides that it has 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.330
 I have nothing that has to take the braking 

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:56.789
 and as with the bicycle 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.050
 the brake is not the only way to stop 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:03.050
 advisors inc 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:06.680
 yes 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.930
 whoever wants to learn how to take advantage of it will not be able to avoid bad omens 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.100
 if you do not see Maria gave him a future champion in this modality 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:18.620
 I've never done it but we're going to try 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:25.650
 it is painful 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.650
 if he is described respectively 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:34.730
 but as the youngest Mariano endured until he landed 

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:37.730
 of being 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.980
 his to the sina invited to try it although I will begin with jumps because 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:46.140
 right would be first to dominate region 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.140
 how is it that no one thought to invent this before 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:52.810
 I do not look good 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:55.440
 professional but at least the only daughter 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.780
 and that is an achievement when something is done for the first time 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:01.410
 400 dollars 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:03.890
 but little by little 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.890
 must do is to grow this work communities of the entity 

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:11.419
 by dawn thank you very much and see you in the next season 

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:17.379
 the rondalla p
