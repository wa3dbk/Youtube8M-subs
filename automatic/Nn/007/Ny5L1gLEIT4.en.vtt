00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:14.130
 booth xbox in its version for xbox one 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:16.170
 Of course I could see that they 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.330
 basically improved that it was already very 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.820
 good in the first game the guardian of light 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.640
 for those who do not know how to do it is 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.650
 the spiritual succession, so to speak 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.539
 this time with up to four players 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.980
 can do all the 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.050
 puzzle 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.450

 that magic business there is very 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.440
 interesting the theme of the game I 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.000
 I liked the first candy I remember. 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.410
 that I even put in the video deserves 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.390
 continued when I recorded my 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.520
 first game with the participation of my 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.950

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.289
 it seems that they answered the request is a game 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.719
 It was right there which is down 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:54.149
 the spin-off zinho and now will have a 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.350
 great sequence that is leaving like this 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.820
 with eyes shining 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.879
 I saw some scenes here while I played 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.410
 there you have pictures to check the game 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:05.070
 it's really beautiful it does not have that 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:07.590
 something like us but accept let's say a 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.510
 indie style new generation knows it team 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.850
 well polished very well well finished 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:15.540
 effects are very good 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.860
 It's the game there thinking about multiplayer. 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.400
 I think he's being very well. 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:22.350
 mounted this time is not so much the action 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.240
 As in the first one, he's fine. 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.939
 balanced with the puzzles I am 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:30.270

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:33.030

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:46.020
 very good very fun 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:48.780
 looking at the game I was not feeling 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:51.720
 great motivation to play but to play 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.670

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.280
 Sure this dirt in the game 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.550
 really fun the drive stayed 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.430
 very good 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:03.280
 He is very colorful and expressive. 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:04.840
 by vitor person does not know if the game will 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.330
 if I support myself with this, I do not know what 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:10.420
 will have content in the main game 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:12.520
 final version of it is to launch in relation to 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:14.770
 to which I can test here that it is only one 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:16.510
 sticker a limited amount of weapons 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:17.470
 are always the same enemies that 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.450
 map and such 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:21.850
 Let's see how the game goes. 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:23.530
 completely but what I played here 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:26.530
 the game has been really pleasing not 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:28.510
 had the slightest pretense of playing me 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:30.610
 the santo andrÃ© brings was not the game that I 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:33.930
 I was expecting a lot more until it was 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:33.930
 the game may surprise
