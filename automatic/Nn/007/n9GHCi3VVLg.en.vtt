exactly<00:01:15.689> what<00:01:15.869> a<00:01:15.900> black<00:01:16.380> ops<00:01:16.619> that<00:01:16.799> I<00:01:16.860> believe

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:17.750 
exactly what a black ops that I believe

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:21.789 
exactly what a black ops that I believe
so<00:01:18.750> now<00:01:19.140> they<00:01:19.290> have<00:01:19.409> the<00:01:19.530> new<00:01:19.740> survival<00:01:20.549> mode

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:21.799 
so now they have the new survival mode

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:25.310 
so now they have the new survival mode
it's<00:01:22.799> a<00:01:23.009> kind<00:01:23.520> of<00:01:23.549> like<00:01:23.640> a<00:01:23.700> sub<00:01:24.000> branch<00:01:24.210> of<00:01:24.450> the

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
it's a kind of like a sub branch of the

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.789 
it's a kind of like a sub branch of the
spec<00:01:26.100> ops<00:01:26.280> mode<00:01:26.610> it<00:01:27.420> is<00:01:27.450> a<00:01:27.630> blu-ray<00:01:27.960> disc<00:01:28.170> does

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
spec ops mode it is a blu-ray disc does

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.289 
spec ops mode it is a blu-ray disc does
contain<00:01:29.130> Dolby<00:01:29.490> Digital<00:01:29.520> that's<00:01:30.090> awesome

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:32.299 
contain Dolby Digital that's awesome

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:35.810 
contain Dolby Digital that's awesome
once<00:01:33.299> the<00:01:33.390> four<00:01:33.600> players<00:01:34.250> split<00:01:35.250> screen<00:01:35.549> so

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
once the four players split screen so

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.969 
once the four players split screen so
you<00:01:35.909> can<00:01:36.030> probably<00:01:36.659> play<00:01:37.020> spec<00:01:37.500> ops<00:01:37.710> but

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
you can probably play spec ops but

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.980 
you can probably play spec ops but
screen<00:01:38.189> I'm<00:01:38.340> guessing<00:01:38.700> to<00:01:39.240> pick<00:01:39.420> 2<00:01:39.720> to<00:01:39.840> 18

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990

screen I'm guessing to pick 2 to 18
network<00:01:40.500> players<00:01:40.770> I<00:01:41.040> believe<00:01:41.340> that's<00:01:41.549> a<00:01:41.640> step

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
network players I believe that's a step

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.700 
network players I believe that's a step
