00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.910
 and my search 

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:10.990
 in the deep blue ocean 

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:15.370
 look for my way 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:17.879
 and thinking that everything in this world had 

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:17.879
 sense 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:24.860
 I submerged 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:31.030
 how beautiful nature 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:31.030
 what endless paradise nobody 

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:39.899
 and for a time 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:42.790
 I thought I was happy more than a little hard 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:47.700
 when I thought I was invincible 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:47.700
 the oxygen I missed 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:54.180
 Now I'm in the middle of nowhere 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.590
 trying to leave 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.290
 I live on the outside 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:01.910
 dead by d 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:06.010
 but I'm still here 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:10.720
 I hear voices up there 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:16.230
 oh god is the people who love him 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:16.230
 that is waiting for me in survival 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:22.690
 I must upload 

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:26.490
 I know perfectly 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:31.680
 I can not disappoint you 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:34.290
 my life has not ended is more my mission 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:40.130
 It has not started yet 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:42.740
 but down here it 's all so dark 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:44.720
 that it's impossible for me to know 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:49.300
 true 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:49.300
 I'm caught between seaweed 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:56.710
 the saltpeter blinds my eyes 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:02:00.100
 the rude my skin 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:04.590
 the sea of consuming 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:04.590
 I do not think I can take it much anymore 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:08.740
 boost inside 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.200
 think of you 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:18.550
 you were born for something 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:21.880
 we all do it 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:25.360
 but I do not feel to be an inside 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:29.220
 and you will not get answers until you 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:29.220
 be at peace with myself 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:34.489
 and a voice from within my own 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:40.100
 be 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:43.750
 he said open my eyes and live 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:43.750
 live to be happy 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:51.520
 and only so 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:53.650
 and only then will you make others happy 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:58.890
 and as if it were a force 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:03:01.190
 superhuman my body began to emerge 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:06.050
 so fast 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:09.660
 So I live here I am again 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:14.370
 at the starting point 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:15.819
 and observing the world in which I have 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:18.880
 born 

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:21.110
 and in which of Munich 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:24.980
 I stand and say 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:31.960
 as the phoenix rises up from me it 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:35.880
 I'm feeling good, I'm going to live 

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:35.880
 business for you
