00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
to three people I think everybody else

sucked ass and by the way this kind of

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:01.729 
sucked ass and by the way this kind of
an<00:01:00.629> older<00:01:00.930> game<00:01:01.050> players<00:01:01.320> only<00:01:01.530> like

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
an older game players only like

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.290 
an older game players only like
Louisville<00:01:01.920> 40<00:01:02.370> in<00:01:02.489> this<00:01:02.609> gameplay<00:01:02.820> believe

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
Louisville 40 in this gameplay believe

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.010 
Louisville 40 in this gameplay believe
so<00:01:03.780> it's<00:01:03.899> kind<00:01:04.080> of<00:01:04.110> old<00:01:04.260> but<00:01:04.500> um<00:01:05.159> I<00:01:06.020> didn't

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
so it's kind of old but um I didn't

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.539 
so it's kind of old but um I didn't
really<00:01:07.140> see<00:01:07.260> too<00:01:07.650> many<00:01:07.770> players<00:01:08.100> on<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.400> map

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
really see too many players on the map

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:09.830 
really see too many players on the map
and<00:01:08.760> I<00:01:08.850> really<00:01:09.090> couldn't<00:01:09.270> hit<00:01:09.450> him<00:01:09.570> too<00:01:09.689> much

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
and I really couldn't hit him too much

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.899 
and I really couldn't hit him too much
on<00:01:10.049> this<00:01:10.380> map<00:01:10.590> I<00:01:10.799> think<00:01:11.159> it'd<00:01:11.250> be<00:01:11.280> good<00:01:11.430> on<00:01:11.700> like

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
on this map I think it'd be good on like

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.929 
on this map I think it'd be good on like
a<00:01:12.090> map<00:01:12.270> like<00:01:12.420> defender<00:01:13.020> or<00:01:13.400> instinct<00:01:14.400> like<00:01:14.640> an

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
a map like defender or instinct like an

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:19.850 
a map like defender or instinct like an
open<00:01:15.390> map<00:01:15.540> like<00:01:15.720> that<00:01:15.960> like<00:01:16.439> bio<00:01:16.650> lab<00:01:18.860> retreat

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
open map like that like bio lab retreat

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.410 
open map like that like bio lab retreat
I<00:01:20.009> don't<00:01:20.159> think<00:01:20.220> they'd<00:01:20.430> be<00:01:20.970> a<00:01:21.000> good<00:01:21.210> kill

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
I don't think they'd be a good kill

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:22.820 
I don't think they'd be a good kill
streak<00:01:21.630> maybe<00:01:21.840> even<00:01:22.049> I'll<00:01:22.200> green<00:01:22.439> bin<00:01:22.619> it

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
streak maybe even I'll green bin it

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.260 
streak maybe even I'll green bin it
could<00:01:23.070> be<00:01:23.220> a<00:01:23.250> good<00:01:23.430> kill<00:01:23.640> streak<00:01:23.790> but<00:01:23.909> this<00:01:24.090> map

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
could be a good kill streak but this map

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.510 
could be a good kill streak but this map
it<00:01:24.750> just<00:01:24.990> I<00:01:25.110> don't<00:01:25.229> know<00:01:25.380> if<00:01:25.500> it<00:01:25.619> was<00:01:25.830> if<00:01:26.189> it<00:01:26.369> was

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
it just I don't know if it was if it was

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:27.770 
it just I don't know if it was if it was
just<00:01:26.580> the<00:01:26.850> amount<00:01:27.060> of<00:01:27.240> players<00:01:27.450> that<00:01:27.570> were

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
just the amount of players that were

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.960 
just the amount of players that were
using<00:01:28.049> blind<00:01:28.860> eye<00:01:29.040> or<00:01:29.250> what<00:01:29.490> but<00:01:29.700> I<00:01:29.759> just

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
using blind eye or what but I just

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.609 
using blind eye or what but I just
couldn't<00:01:30.119> find<00:01:30.570> anybody<00:01:30.780> and<00:01:31.170> then<00:01:31.409> when<00:01:31.590> I

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
couldn't find anybody and then when I

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.350 
couldn't find anybody and then when I
did<00:01:31.890> see<00:01:32.040> some<00:01:32.250> people<00:01:32.400> I<00:01:32.549> have<00:01:32.670> to<00:01:32.790> reload<00:01:33.119> or

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
did see some people I have to reload or

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.030 
did see some people I have to reload or
they're<00:01:33.540> all<00:01:33.630> in<00:01:33.780> a<00:01:33.840> building<00:01:34.259> so<00:01:34.470> kind<00:01:34.950> of

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
they're all in a building so kind of

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.679 
they're all in a building so kind of
sucked<00:01:35.280> but<00:01:35.820> the<00:01:35.909> Paladin<00:01:36.270> I<00:01:36.390> don't<00:01:36.570> think

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
sucked but the Paladin I don't think

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.210 
sucked but the Paladin I don't think
it's<00:01:36.810> very<00:01:36.840> good<00:01:37.170> on<00:01:37.259> maps<00:01:37.590> with<00:01:37.860> a<00:01:37.890> lot<00:01:38.100> of

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
it's very good on maps with a lot of

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.950 
it's very good on maps with a lot of
buildings<00:01:38.520> so<00:01:38.670> I<00:01:38.700> don't<00:01:39.240> suggest<00:01:39.450> running<00:01:39.720> it

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
buildings so I don't suggest running it

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.340 
buildings so I don't suggest running it
if<00:01:40.110> you're<00:01:40.290> on<00:01:40.409> instinct<00:01:41.159> or<00:01:41.990> what<00:01:42.990> other<00:01:43.110> map

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
if you're on instinct or what other map

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.139 
if you're on instinct or what other map
did<00:01:43.530> I<00:01:43.590> say<00:01:43.619> I<00:01:43.829> said<00:01:44.220> instincts<00:01:44.790> and<00:01:44.939> some

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
did I say I said instincts and some

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:46.850 
did I say I said instincts and some
other<00:01:45.329> map<00:01:45.540> defender<00:01:46.049> I<00:01:46.229> think<00:01:46.560> you<00:01:46.710> should

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
other map defender I think you should

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.170 
other map defender I think you should
run<00:01:47.040> it<00:01:47.159> and<00:01:47.280> give<00:01:47.399> it<00:01:47.430> a<00:01:47.549> try<00:01:47.759> you<00:01:47.820> might<00:01:48.060> be

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
run it and give it a try you might be

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.179 
run it and give it a try you might be
able<00:01:48.240> to<00:01:48.360> get<00:01:48.810> shit<00:01:49.079> ton<00:01:49.290> of<00:01:49.320> kills<00:01:49.619> I<00:01:49.799> might

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
able to get shit ton of kills I might

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:54.530 
able to get shit ton of kills I might
try<00:01:50.430> it<00:01:50.490> later<00:01:50.670> today<00:01:51.000> but<00:01:53.000> the<00:01:54.000> Paladins<00:01:54.390> all

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
try it later today but the Paladins all

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:55.550 
try it later today but the Paladins all
right<00:01:54.750> I<00:01:54.960> don't<00:01:55.110> think<00:01:55.170> it's<00:01:55.350> worth<00:01:55.530> the

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
right I don't think it's worth the

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.410 
right I don't think it's worth the
amount<00:01:55.770> of<00:01:55.979> kills<00:01:56.130> that<00:01:56.280> you<00:01:56.369> need<00:01:56.490> to<00:01:56.579> get<00:01:56.700> I

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
amount of kills that you need to get I

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.109 
amount of kills that you need to get I
feel<00:01:58.259> like<00:01:58.619> I'm<00:01:59.100> gonna<00:01:59.340> now<00:01:59.820> I'm<00:01:59.909> going<00:02:00.030> to

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
feel like I'm gonna now I'm going to

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.310 
feel like I'm gonna now I'm going to
transition<00:02:00.450> to<00:02:00.630> what<00:02:00.840> I<00:02:00.869> think<00:02:00.990> would<00:02:01.259> make

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
transition to what I think would make

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.530 
transition to what I think would make
advanced<00:02:01.890> warfare<00:02:02.340> play<00:02:03.030> a<00:02:03.060> little<00:02:03.180> bit

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
advanced warfare play a little bit

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:04.760 
advanced warfare play a little bit
better<00:02:03.659> in<00:02:03.869> my<00:02:03.990> opinion<00:02:04.020> make<00:02:04.500> it<00:02:04.649> a<00:02:04.680> little

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
better in my opinion make it a little

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.280 
better in my opinion make it a little
bit<00:02:04.950> more<00:02:05.100> enjoyable<00:02:05.610> for<00:02:05.670> me<00:02:05.899> and<00:02:06.899> I<00:02:06.990> think<00:02:07.200> a

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
bit more enjoyable for me and I think a

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:08.570 
bit more enjoyable for me and I think a
lot<00:02:07.320> of<00:02:07.469> you<00:02:07.560> guys<00:02:07.619> can<00:02:07.890> agree<00:02:08.160> on<00:02:08.190> some<00:02:08.429> of<00:02:08.550> my

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
lot of you guys can agree on some of my

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.150 
lot of you guys can agree on some of my
statements<00:02:09.209> here<00:02:09.390> but<00:02:10.020> anyways<00:02:10.440> the<00:02:10.920> first

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
statements here but anyways the first

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.290 
statements here but anyways the first
thing<00:02:11.310> that<00:02:11.459> i<00:02:11.489> would<00:02:11.640> change<00:02:11.760> in<00:02:12.060> advanced

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
thing that i would change in advanced

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.230 
thing that i would change in advanced
warfare<00:02:12.720> is

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240 
warfare is

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.600 
warfare is
it's<00:02:13.690> ridiculously<00:02:14.500> hard<00:02:14.800> to<00:02:14.920> see<00:02:15.070> players<00:02:15.340> in

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
it's ridiculously hard to see players in

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:17.550 
it's ridiculously hard to see players in
this<00:02:15.700> game<00:02:15.760> a<00:02:16.660> lot<00:02:17.020> of<00:02:17.140> the<00:02:17.200> times<00:02:17.380> when

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
this game a lot of the times when

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.120 
this game a lot of the times when
players<00:02:17.800> are<00:02:18.010> like<00:02:18.220> laying<00:02:18.550> prone<00:02:18.910> or<00:02:19.980> just<00:02:20.980> in

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.130 
players are like laying prone or just in

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:23.490 
players are like laying prone or just in
a<00:02:21.250> corner<00:02:21.670> it's<00:02:21.910> almost<00:02:22.330> impossible<00:02:22.750> to<00:02:23.140> tell

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
a corner it's almost impossible to tell

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.500 
a corner it's almost impossible to tell
or<00:02:23.740> distinguish<00:02:24.280> them<00:02:24.400> from<00:02:24.430> the<00:02:24.760> map<00:02:24.970> and<00:02:25.390> a

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
or distinguish them from the map and a

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:27.150 
or distinguish them from the map and a
lot<00:02:25.720> of<00:02:25.750> the<00:02:25.930> times<00:02:26.140> i<00:02:26.290> find<00:02:26.500> myself<00:02:26.650> shooting

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
lot of the times i find myself shooting

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:28.770 
lot of the times i find myself shooting
dead<00:02:27.340> bites<00:02:27.550> because<00:02:27.880> i<00:02:28.150> think<00:02:28.210> it's<00:02:28.480> a<00:02:28.540> player

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
dead bites because i think it's a player

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:30.630 
dead bites because i think it's a player
or<00:02:29.350> some<00:02:29.620> of<00:02:29.650> the<00:02:29.740> times<00:02:29.980> i<00:02:30.100> think<00:02:30.310> it's<00:02:30.400> a<00:02:30.460> dead

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
or some of the times i think it's a dead

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:31.950 
or some of the times i think it's a dead
player<00:02:30.880> and<00:02:31.030> I<00:02:31.060> don't<00:02:31.240> shoot<00:02:31.450> at<00:02:31.630> them<00:02:31.780> so<00:02:31.930> I

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:31.960 
player and I don't shoot at them so I

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:34.260 
player and I don't shoot at them so I
keep<00:02:32.200> moving<00:02:32.530> in<00:02:32.680> they<00:02:32.800> kill<00:02:33.040> me<00:02:33.190> and<00:02:33.400> I<00:02:34.030> really

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:34.270 
keep moving in they kill me and I really

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:35.730 
keep moving in they kill me and I really
wish<00:02:34.570> advanced<00:02:34.960> warfare<00:02:35.290> would<00:02:35.410> make<00:02:35.560> it<00:02:35.680> a

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:35.740 
wish advanced warfare would make it a

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:37.860 
wish advanced warfare would make it a
lot<00:02:35.770> easier<00:02:35.980> to<00:02:36.520> see<00:02:36.700> the<00:02:36.850> players<00:02:37.090> I<00:02:37.420> don't

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
lot easier to see the players I don't

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:39.150 
lot easier to see the players I don't
know<00:02:37.960> if<00:02:38.170> these<00:02:38.290> players<00:02:38.470> are<00:02:38.650> even<00:02:38.980> running

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
know if these players are even running

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:40.950 
know if these players are even running
cold<00:02:39.370> blooded<00:02:39.700> I<00:02:39.910> feel<00:02:40.240> like<00:02:40.360> it's<00:02:40.570> way<00:02:40.900> too

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:40.960 
cold blooded I feel like it's way too

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:42.950 
cold blooded I feel like it's way too
hard<00:02:41.380> to<00:02:41.440> see<00:02:41.590> players<00:02:41.800> in<00:02:42.010> this<00:02:42.100> game<00:02:42.190> and

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:42.960 
hard to see players in this game and

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.870 
hard to see players in this game and
distinguish<00:02:43.960> them<00:02:44.140> it's<00:02:44.320> it's<00:02:45.040> really<00:02:45.670> really

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 
distinguish them it's it's really really

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:47.640 
distinguish them it's it's really really
hard<00:02:46.000> for<00:02:46.180> me<00:02:46.300> as<00:02:46.420> a<00:02:46.450> player<00:02:46.630> and<00:02:46.750> I<00:02:47.200> think<00:02:47.560> I'm

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
hard for me as a player and I think I'm

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:49.260 
hard for me as a player and I think I'm
a<00:02:47.740> good<00:02:47.890> player<00:02:48.070> and<00:02:48.430> it's<00:02:48.970> just<00:02:49.150> really

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:49.270 
a good player and it's just really

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:51.120 
a good player and it's just really
really<00:02:49.660> hard<00:02:49.870> to<00:02:49.960> see<00:02:50.110> players<00:02:50.350> and<00:02:50.650> I<00:02:50.920> don't

really hard to see players and I don't

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:52.380 
really hard to see players and I don't
know<00:02:51.190> if<00:02:51.310> you<00:02:51.400> guys<00:02:51.550> can<00:02:51.610> agree<00:02:52.090> with<00:02:52.120> me<00:02:52.360> or

know if you guys can agree with me or
that<00:02:52.630> on<00:02:52.870> that<00:02:53.470> but<00:02:53.770> i<00:02:54.010> think<00:02:54.430> i<00:02:54.580> think<00:02:54.670> a<00:02:55.060> lot

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:55.300 
that on that but i think i think a lot

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:57.210 
that on that but i think i think a lot
of<00:02:55.330> majority<00:02:56.320> of<00:02:56.350> the<00:02:56.470> players<00:02:56.680> find<00:02:56.920> it<00:02:57.040> hard

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.220 
of majority of the players find it hard

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:58.650 
of majority of the players find it hard
to<00:02:57.310> see<00:02:57.460> players<00:02:57.700> and<00:02:58.030> harder<00:02:58.300> to<00:02:58.360> determine

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:58.660 
to see players and harder to determine

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:01.080 
to see players and harder to determine
if<00:02:59.050> it's<00:02:59.380> a<00:02:59.500> if<00:02:59.680> it's<00:02:59.920> a<00:03:00.040> real<00:03:00.280> person<00:03:00.550> or<00:03:00.850> a

dead body the second thing that i would

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:05.430 
dead body the second thing that i would
like<00:03:03.760> to<00:03:03.880> be<00:03:04.000> changed<00:03:04.420> in<00:03:04.570> this<00:03:04.720> game<00:03:04.930> is<00:03:05.200> a<00:03:05.410> lot

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:05.440 
like to be changed in this game is a lot

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.200 
like to be changed in this game is a lot
of<00:03:05.620> people<00:03:05.890> say<00:03:06.040> that<00:03:06.250> the<00:03:06.370> bow<00:03:06.550> doesn't<00:03:07.060> need

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:07.210 
of people say that the bow doesn't need

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:08.940 
of people say that the bow doesn't need
to<00:03:07.300> be<00:03:07.420> nerve<00:03:07.630> and<00:03:07.810> all<00:03:08.260> the<00:03:08.410> other<00:03:08.560> guns<00:03:08.800> need

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
to be nerve and all the other guns need

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:11.520 
to be nerve and all the other guns need
to<00:03:09.040> be<00:03:09.160> buffed<00:03:09.520> and<00:03:09.820> what<00:03:10.750> I<00:03:10.780> was<00:03:10.960> thinking<00:03:11.380> is

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530 
to be buffed and what I was thinking is

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:16.260 
to be buffed and what I was thinking is
that<00:03:12.490> i<00:03:13.260> would<00:03:14.260> actually<00:03:14.560> nerf<00:03:15.130> the<00:03:15.310> bow<00:03:15.460> and<00:03:15.790> i

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:16.270 
that i would actually nerf the bow and i

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:18.120 
that i would actually nerf the bow and i
would<00:03:16.450> keep<00:03:16.900> the<00:03:17.080> other<00:03:17.230> AR<00:03:17.620> is<00:03:17.740> kind<00:03:17.950> of<00:03:18.010> the

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:18.130 
would keep the other AR is kind of the

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:21.240 
would keep the other AR is kind of the
same<00:03:18.370> and<00:03:18.700> what<00:03:19.630> i<00:03:19.660> would<00:03:19.900> do<00:03:20.110> is<00:03:20.500> buff<00:03:21.070> the

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:21.250 
same and what i would do is buff the

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:22.860 
same and what i would do is buff the
other<00:03:21.400> guns<00:03:21.700> and<00:03:22.000> nerf<00:03:22.120> the<00:03:22.270> bow<00:03:22.390> a<00:03:22.420> little<00:03:22.750> bit

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:22.870 
other guns and nerf the bow a little bit

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:24.480 
other guns and nerf the bow a little bit
i<00:03:22.900> think<00:03:23.020> the<00:03:23.260> bow<00:03:23.380> is<00:03:23.530> way<00:03:23.680> too<00:03:23.740> good<00:03:24.040> i<00:03:24.250> think

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:24.490 
i think the bow is way too good i think

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:27.240 
i think the bow is way too good i think
it's<00:03:24.760> a<00:03:24.820> three<00:03:25.060> shot<00:03:25.240> to<00:03:25.480> shot<00:03:25.660> gun<00:03:25.890> no<00:03:26.890> recoil

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250 
it's a three shot to shot gun no recoil

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:29.730 
it's a three shot to shot gun no recoil
spits<00:03:27.610> spit<00:03:28.150> shots<00:03:28.420> like<00:03:28.600> crazy<00:03:28.930> and<00:03:29.260> its

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:29.740 
spits spit shots like crazy and its

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:31.470 
spits spit shots like crazy and its
really<00:03:29.830> really<00:03:30.190> good<00:03:30.430> up<00:03:30.550> close<00:03:30.580> I<00:03:31.060> think<00:03:31.360> the

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.480 
really really good up close I think the

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.690 
really really good up close I think the
bowel<00:03:31.660> needs<00:03:31.900> a<00:03:32.020> nerf<00:03:32.230> and<00:03:32.440> I<00:03:33.010> think<00:03:33.490> the<00:03:33.550> other

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:33.700 
bowel needs a nerf and I think the other

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:36.240 
bowel needs a nerf and I think the other
guns<00:03:33.910> need<00:03:34.090> a<00:03:34.120> buff<00:03:34.390> as<00:03:34.600> well<00:03:34.990> sniping<00:03:35.980> I<00:03:36.070> think

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.250 
guns need a buff as well sniping I think

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:38.820 
guns need a buff as well sniping I think
sniping<00:03:36.610> is<00:03:36.670> fine<00:03:36.820> where<00:03:37.030> it's<00:03:37.150> at<00:03:37.380> I<00:03:38.380> think

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:38.830 
sniping is fine where it's at I think

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:40.800 
sniping is fine where it's at I think
shotguns<00:03:39.280> need<00:03:39.550> a<00:03:39.580> little<00:03:39.880> bit<00:03:40.060> a<00:03:40.240> little<00:03:40.300> bit

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:40.810 
shotguns need a little bit a little bit

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:43.470 
shotguns need a little bit a little bit

they actually weren't that bad but the
akimbo<00:04:06.490> LMGs<00:04:07.480> were<00:04:07.690> probably<00:04:07.900> the<00:04:08.110> worst<00:04:08.490> guns

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:09.490

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:18.489 
the bow a little bit buff the other guns

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:23.010 
think it'd be a really good game
maybe<00:04:21.609> leave<00:04:21.850> the<00:04:21.970> snipers<00:04:22.030> the<00:04:22.389> same<00:04:22.660> as<00:04:22.810> well

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:23.020 
maybe leave the snipers the same as well

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:25.469 
maybe leave the snipers the same as well
I<00:04:23.860> think<00:04:24.100> smoking<00:04:24.460> is<00:04:24.699> fine<00:04:24.970> in<00:04:25.150> this<00:04:25.240> game<00:04:25.449> I

00:04:25.469 --> 00:04:25.479 
I think smoking is fine in this game I

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:27.059 
I think smoking is fine in this game I
think<00:04:25.630> it's<00:04:25.930> strong<00:04:26.229> you<00:04:26.380> think<00:04:26.560> it's<00:04:26.650> good<00:04:26.830> on

00:04:27.059 --> 00:04:27.069 
think it's strong you think it's good on

00:04:27.069 --> 00:04:29.159 
think it's strong you think it's good on
certain<00:04:27.430> maps<00:04:27.580> and<00:04:27.910> I<00:04:28.240> think<00:04:28.449> quick<00:04:28.660> scoper<00:04:29.050> is

00:04:29.159 --> 00:04:29.169 
certain maps and I think quick scoper is

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:30.990 
certain maps and I think quick scoper is
like<00:04:29.380> it<00:04:29.590> I<00:04:29.740> have<00:04:30.039> one<00:04:30.220> friend<00:04:30.370> I<00:04:30.550> talked<00:04:30.819> to<00:04:30.880> he

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:31.000 
like it I have one friend I talked to he

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.089 
like it I have one friend I talked to he
says<00:04:31.180> he<00:04:31.300> loves<00:04:31.509> it<00:04:31.690> so<00:04:32.289> at<00:04:32.380> least<00:04:32.590> nothing<00:04:32.860> the

00:04:33.089 --> 00:04:33.099 
says he loves it so at least nothing the

00:04:33.099 --> 00:04:35.550 
says he loves it so at least nothing the
same<00:04:33.569> the<00:04:34.569> next<00:04:34.840> thing<00:04:34.960> i<00:04:35.110> would<00:04:35.169> i<00:04:35.500> would

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:35.560 
same the next thing i would i would

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:38.730 
same the next thing i would i would
change<00:04:35.949> is<00:04:36.220> buffing<00:04:36.819> killstreaks<00:04:37.740> we're

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:38.740 
change is buffing killstreaks we're

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:40.409 
change is buffing killstreaks we're
making<00:04:39.069> them<00:04:39.190> easier<00:04:39.520> to<00:04:39.580> get<00:04:39.789> one<00:04:40.120> or<00:04:40.270> the

00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:40.419 
making them easier to get one or the

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:42.270 
making them easier to get one or the
other<00:04:40.449> I<00:04:40.660> think<00:04:40.830> killstreaks<00:04:41.830> need<00:04:42.069> to<00:04:42.160> be

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:42.280 
other I think killstreaks need to be

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:46.290 
other I think killstreaks need to be
buffed<00:04:42.520> or<00:04:43.030> they<00:04:43.720> need<00:04:43.960> to<00:04:44.050> be<00:04:45.060> easier<00:04:46.060> to<00:04:46.180> get

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:46.300 
buffed or they need to be easier to get

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:47.939 
buffed or they need to be easier to get
one<00:04:46.539> of<00:04:46.630> the<00:04:46.720> one<00:04:46.960> of<00:04:46.990> the<00:04:47.139> two<00:04:47.289> and<00:04:47.560> I<00:04:47.770> feel

00:04:47.939 --> 00:04:47.949 
one of the one of the two and I feel

00:04:47.949 --> 00:04:49.379 
one of the one of the two and I feel
like<00:04:48.069> system<00:04:48.400> hack<00:04:48.580> and<00:04:48.759> the<00:04:48.819> UAV<00:04:49.210> are<00:04:49.360> a

00:04:49.379 --> 00:04:49.389 
like system hack and the UAV are a

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:50.640 
like system hack and the UAV are a
little<00:04:49.539> too<00:04:49.750> strong<00:04:49.930> right<00:04:50.199> now<00:04:50.229> I<00:04:50.380> would

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:50.650 
little too strong right now I would

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:51.980 
little too strong right now I would
increase<00:04:51.009> the<00:04:51.039> points<00:04:51.460> to<00:04:51.580> get<00:04:51.729> those

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:51.990 
increase the points to get those

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:54.150 
increase the points to get those
especially<00:04:52.990> the<00:04:53.199> systemic<00:04:53.680> I<00:04:53.770> feel<00:04:53.979> like<00:04:54.039> the

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:54.160 
especially the systemic I feel like the

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:56.460 
especially the systemic I feel like the
system<00:04:54.430> hack<00:04:54.610> is<00:04:54.759> like<00:04:54.910> an<00:04:55.030> EMP<00:04:55.479> it's<00:04:56.169> like

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:56.470 
system hack is like an EMP it's like

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:59.760 
system hack is like an EMP it's like
just<00:04:56.889> like<00:04:56.979> a<00:04:57.039> vsat<00:04:57.940> kinda<00:04:58.360> but<00:04:58.690> better<00:04:58.900> so<00:04:59.740> I

00:04:59.760 --> 00:04:59.770 
just like a vsat kinda but better so I

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:01.800 
just like a vsat kinda but better so I
would<00:05:00.070> actually<00:05:00.220> increase<00:05:00.550> the<00:05:01.060> system<00:05:01.660> hack

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:01.810 
would actually increase the system hack

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:04.950 
would actually increase the system hack
to<00:05:02.440> around<00:05:02.710> 900<00:05:03.280> points<00:05:03.430> just<00:05:03.970> to<00:05:04.030> get<00:05:04.270> it<00:05:04.389> so

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:04.960 
to around 900 points just to get it so

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:06.629 
to around 900 points just to get it so
that<00:05:05.199> would<00:05:05.320> just<00:05:05.530> be<00:05:05.590> me<00:05:05.680> balancing<00:05:06.340> it<00:05:06.490> out<00:05:06.580> I

00:05:06.629 --> 00:05:06.639 
that would just be me balancing it out I

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:08.730 
that would just be me balancing it out I
think<00:05:06.940> sis<00:05:07.090> mag<00:05:07.330> is<00:05:07.479> really<00:05:07.720> annoying<00:05:07.990> and<00:05:08.229> I

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:08.740 
think sis mag is really annoying and I

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:10.430 
think sis mag is really annoying and I
feel<00:05:08.949> it's<00:05:09.099> really<00:05:09.340> really<00:05:09.580> easy<00:05:09.610> to<00:05:09.970> get<00:05:10.090> and

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:10.440 
feel it's really really easy to get and

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:14.730 
feel it's really really easy to get and
i<00:05:11.440> would<00:05:11.770> i<00:05:11.919> would<00:05:11.949> actually<00:05:13.470> increase<00:05:14.470> the

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:14.740 
i would i would actually increase the

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:16.080 
i would i would actually increase the
amount<00:05:14.889> of<00:05:14.949> points<00:05:15.099> to<00:05:15.220> get<00:05:15.340> and<00:05:15.759> like<00:05:15.849> i<00:05:15.940> said

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:16.090 
amount of points to get and like i said

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:17.700 
amount of points to get and like i said
buffs<00:05:16.419> kill<00:05:16.840> streaks<00:05:17.080> or<00:05:17.229> make<00:05:17.349> them<00:05:17.440> easier

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:17.710 
buffs kill streaks or make them easier

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:19.020 
buffs kill streaks or make them easier
to<00:05:17.770> get<00:05:17.889> more<00:05:18.070> of<00:05:18.250> the<00:05:18.340> two<00:05:18.490> for<00:05:18.759> the<00:05:18.820> players

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:19.030 
to get more of the two for the players

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:20.640 
to get more of the two for the players
because<00:05:19.300> I<00:05:19.360> don't<00:05:19.539> feel<00:05:19.599> like<00:05:19.810> a<00:05:19.990> majority<00:05:20.620> of

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:20.650 
because I don't feel like a majority of

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:21.719 
because I don't feel like a majority of
the<00:05:20.710> players<00:05:20.919> can<00:05:21.130> even<00:05:21.340> get<00:05:21.460> these<00:05:21.610> high

00:05:21.719 --> 00:05:21.729 
the players can even get these high

00:05:21.729 --> 00:05:24.300 
the players can even get these high
killstreaks<00:05:22.560> most<00:05:23.560> of<00:05:23.650> the<00:05:23.710> times<00:05:23.889> when<00:05:24.039> I<00:05:24.130> go

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:24.310 
killstreaks most of the times when I go

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:25.589 
killstreaks most of the times when I go
for<00:05:24.460> these<00:05:24.520> high<00:05:24.699> killstreaks<00:05:24.940> against<00:05:25.389> other

00:05:25.589 --> 00:05:25.599 
for these high killstreaks against other

00:05:25.599 --> 00:05:27.089 
for these high killstreaks against other
really<00:05:25.990> really<00:05:26.199> solid<00:05:26.440> players<00:05:26.740> i<00:05:26.889> find

00:05:27.089 --> 00:05:27.099 
really really solid players i find

00:05:27.099 --> 00:05:31.020 
really really solid players i find
myself<00:05:27.250> camping<00:05:27.759> like<00:05:27.909> a<00:05:27.940> twat<00:05:28.240> so<00:05:29.400> yeah<00:05:30.400> just

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:31.030 
myself camping like a twat so yeah just

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:32.640 
myself camping like a twat so yeah just
do<00:05:31.180> that<00:05:31.330> also<00:05:31.840> another<00:05:32.080> thing<00:05:32.199> that<00:05:32.500> i<00:05:32.530> would

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:32.650 
do that also another thing that i would

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:34.260 
do that also another thing that i would
like<00:05:32.860> to<00:05:33.009> be<00:05:33.099> changed<00:05:33.520> is<00:05:33.669> that<00:05:33.729> when

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:34.270 
like to be changed is that when

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:36.330 
like to be changed is that when
somebody's<00:05:34.690> on<00:05:34.780> a<00:05:34.810> B<00:05:34.990> flat<00:05:35.199> on<00:05:35.620> a<00:05:35.710> flag<00:05:36.039> and

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:36.340 
somebody's on a B flat on a flag and

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:38.100 
somebody's on a B flat on a flag and
it's<00:05:36.460> neutral<00:05:36.909> you<00:05:37.389> don't<00:05:37.599> get<00:05:37.750> the<00:05:37.840> hundred

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:38.110 
it's neutral you don't get the hundred

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:40.350 
it's neutral you don't get the hundred
points<00:05:38.440> per<00:05:38.919> kill<00:05:39.130> for<00:05:39.400> it<00:05:39.490> which<00:05:40.000> doesn't

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:40.360 
points per kill for it which doesn't

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:41.730 
points per kill for it which doesn't
make<00:05:40.419> any<00:05:40.630> sense<00:05:40.870> because<00:05:41.289> you're<00:05:41.409> defending

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:41.740 
make any sense because you're defending

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:43.140 
make any sense because you're defending
the<00:05:41.919> flag<00:05:42.130> getting<00:05:42.490> the<00:05:42.580> guy<00:05:42.669> off<00:05:42.820> the<00:05:42.849> flag

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:43.150 
the flag getting the guy off the flag

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:45.060 
the flag getting the guy off the flag
and<00:05:43.419> since<00:05:43.750> it's<00:05:43.930> neutral<00:05:44.380> you're<00:05:44.919> not

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:45.070 
and since it's neutral you're not

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:46.649 
and since it's neutral you're not
getting<00:05:45.190> any<00:05:45.460> points<00:05:45.880> for<00:05:45.909> it<00:05:46.180> so<00:05:46.270> I<00:05:46.330> find<00:05:46.570> that

00:05:46.649 --> 00:05:46.659 
getting any points for it so I find that

00:05:46.659 --> 00:05:48.420 
getting any points for it so I find that
pretty<00:05:47.169> frustrating<00:05:47.800> but<00:05:47.889> those<00:05:48.070> are<00:05:48.190> some

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:48.430 
pretty frustrating but those are some

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:49.920 
pretty frustrating but those are some
three<00:05:48.669> things<00:05:48.909> that<00:05:49.090> I<00:05:49.150> would<00:05:49.360> change<00:05:49.389> with
