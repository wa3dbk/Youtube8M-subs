00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:15.949 
between
a<00:02:13.760> flounder<00:02:14.760> and<00:02:14.879> a<00:02:15.180> tilapia<00:02:15.420> which<00:02:15.749> means

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
a flounder and a tilapia which means

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:17.869 
a flounder and a tilapia which means
it's<00:02:16.079> basically<00:02:16.349> flavorless<00:02:16.859> so<00:02:17.219> there<00:02:17.760> you

00:02:17.869 --> 00:02:17.879 
it's basically flavorless so there you

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:20.149 
it's basically flavorless so there you
go<00:02:17.939> but<00:02:18.450> it<00:02:19.019> looked<00:02:19.379> good<00:02:19.560> it<00:02:19.739> smelled<00:02:19.980> good

00:02:20.149 --> 00:02:20.159 
go but it looked good it smelled good

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:21.890 
go but it looked good it smelled good
give<00:02:20.790> it<00:02:20.909> a<00:02:20.969> try<00:02:21.180> and<00:02:21.510> it's<00:02:21.689> great<00:02:21.840> because

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
give it a try and it's great because

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.449 
give it a try and it's great because
it's<00:02:22.109> like<00:02:22.200> a<00:02:22.260> blank<00:02:22.499> canvas<00:02:22.590> so<00:02:23.310> when<00:02:23.400> you

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
it's like a blank canvas so when you

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:25.129 
it's like a blank canvas so when you
made<00:02:23.579> this<00:02:23.700> dish<00:02:23.999> another<00:02:24.450> thing<00:02:24.629> I<00:02:24.719> change<00:02:24.989> is

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:25.139 
made this dish another thing I change is

00:02:25.139 --> 00:02:27.559 
made this dish another thing I change is
supposed<00:02:25.319> to<00:02:25.409> be<00:02:25.530> used<00:02:25.709> prunes<00:02:26.099> I<00:02:26.370> had<00:02:26.969> figs<00:02:27.299> I

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:22.690 
just cook this for that peg mates or so

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:24.940 
just cook this for that peg mates or so
so<00:05:23.690> the<00:05:23.720> original<00:05:24.169> recipe<00:05:24.470> calls<00:05:24.680> for<00:05:24.770> the

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:24.950 
so the original recipe calls for the

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:27.010 
so the original recipe calls for the
prunes<00:05:25.250> to<00:05:25.520> soak<00:05:25.729> in<00:05:25.910> the<00:05:25.940> line<00:05:26.180> for<00:05:26.210> an<00:05:26.570> hour<00:05:26.690> I

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:27.020 
prunes to soak in the line for an hour I

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:28.540 
prunes to soak in the line for an hour I
didn't<00:05:27.500> have<00:05:27.650> an<00:05:27.800> hour<00:05:27.950> so<00:05:28.190> what<00:05:28.280> I'm<00:05:28.370> going<00:05:28.490> to

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:28.550 
didn't have an hour so what I'm going to

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:30.100 
didn't have an hour so what I'm going to
do<00:05:28.700> is<00:05:28.910> it<00:05:29.330> and<00:05:29.539> then<00:05:29.630> you<00:05:29.720> would<00:05:29.870> lay<00:05:30.080> the

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:30.110 
do is it and then you would lay the

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:32.170 
do is it and then you would lay the
prunes<00:05:30.860> on<00:05:31.070> top<00:05:31.280> of<00:05:31.430> the<00:05:31.490> fish<00:05:31.669> and<00:05:31.880> then<00:05:31.940> pour

this recipe the right you know like i
said<00:07:41.460> in<00:07:41.940> the<00:07:42.300> beginning<00:07:42.420> the<00:07:42.750> recipe<00:07:43.080> was

00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:43.260 
said in the beginning the recipe was

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:45.440 
said in the beginning the recipe was
meant<00:07:43.950> for<00:07:44.190> tuna<00:07:44.490> steaks<00:07:44.760> maybe<00:07:45.060> that<00:07:45.270> would

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:45.450 
meant for tuna steaks maybe that would

00:07:45.450 --> 00:07:47.630 
meant for tuna steaks maybe that would
offset<00:07:46.410> it<00:07:46.740> a<00:07:46.770> little<00:07:46.980> bad<00:07:47.100> as<00:07:47.160> opposed<00:07:47.430> to<00:07:47.550> the

00:07:47.630 --> 00:07:47.640 
offset it a little bad as opposed to the

00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:50.060 
offset it a little bad as opposed to the
white<00:07:47.760> fish<00:07:48.080> but<00:07:49.080> again<00:07:49.470> i<00:07:49.500> would<00:07:49.710> probably

00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:50.070 
white fish but again i would probably

00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:53.000 
white fish but again i would probably
ratchet<00:07:50.430> down<00:07:50.580> the<00:07:50.820> clove<00:07:51.510> a<00:07:51.750> wee<00:07:51.990> bit<00:07:52.170> good

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:53.010 
ratchet down the clove a wee bit good

00:07:53.010 --> 00:07:57.590 
ratchet down the clove a wee bit good
fish<00:07:53.250> where<00:07:53.820> is<00:07:53.910> it<00:07:54.030> ground<00:07:54.590> fairway
