they were the stupid deal of the day a
few<00:00:13.139> days<00:00:13.469> ago<00:00:13.650> they<00:00:14.040> had<00:00:14.190> them<00:00:14.280> listed<00:00:14.580> at

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
few days ago they had them listed at

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.580 
few days ago they had them listed at
like<00:00:15.120> 170<00:00:15.929> 999<00:00:16.890> the<00:00:17.490> normal<00:00:17.789> 1899<00:00:18.390> and<00:00:19.289> so<00:00:19.560> I

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
like 170 999 the normal 1899 and so I

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.630 
like 170 999 the normal 1899 and so I
decided<00:00:20.039> to<00:00:20.130> pick<00:00:20.279> up<00:00:20.430> two<00:00:22.550> there<00:00:23.550> are<00:00:23.609> a

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
decided to pick up two there are a

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.730 
decided to pick up two there are a
thousand<00:00:24.000> watts<00:00:24.150> they<00:00:24.930> have<00:00:25.170> a<00:00:25.199> 12<00:00:25.619> inch

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
thousand watts they have a 12 inch

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.429 
thousand watts they have a 12 inch
woofer<00:00:26.220> and<00:00:26.400> a<00:00:26.880> one<00:00:27.180> in<00:00:27.300> 3/4<00:00:27.930> inch<00:00:28.140> high

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439

frequency<00:00:28.890> driver<00:00:29.210> at<00:00:30.210> first<00:00:30.570> impression

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
frequency driver at first impression

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.110 
frequency driver at first impression
they<00:00:31.560> might<00:00:32.099> look<00:00:32.369> like<00:00:32.669> the<00:00:33.660> alto<00:00:34.700> true<00:00:35.700> sonic

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
they might look like the alto true sonic

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.729 
they might look like the alto true sonic
ts1<00:00:36.660> 12a<00:00:37.730> and<00:00:38.730> that's<00:00:39.030> because<00:00:39.420> alesis<00:00:40.350> and

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
ts1 12a and that's because alesis and

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.440 
ts1 12a and that's because alesis and
alto<00:00:41.100> are<00:00:41.370> actually<00:00:41.700> owned<00:00:41.910> by<00:00:42.090> the<00:00:42.149> same

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
alto are actually owned by the same

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.270 
alto are actually owned by the same
company<00:00:42.510> and<00:00:43.140> so<00:00:43.290> it's<00:00:43.440> probably<00:00:43.980> the<00:00:44.100> same

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
company and so it's probably the same

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.660 
company and so it's probably the same
cabinet<00:00:44.760> mostly<00:00:45.660> the<00:00:45.750> same<00:00:45.960> cabinet<00:00:46.350> design

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:46.670 
cabinet mostly the same cabinet design

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:49.490 
cabinet mostly the same cabinet design
however<00:00:47.670> the<00:00:48.390> differences<00:00:48.780> between<00:00:48.960> the<00:00:49.289> two

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
however the differences between the two

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.350 
however the differences between the two
this<00:00:50.100> is<00:00:50.160> a<00:00:50.280> thousand<00:00:50.760> watts<00:00:50.910> whereas<00:00:51.270> the

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
this is a thousand watts whereas the

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.200 
this is a thousand watts whereas the
alto<00:00:51.629> peeks<00:00:52.199> at<00:00:52.410> 800<00:00:52.949> and<00:00:52.980> I<00:00:53.399> think<00:00:53.550> it's<00:00:53.670> 400

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
alto peeks at 800 and I think it's 400

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.200 
alto peeks at 800 and I think it's 400
rms<00:00:54.980> I'm<00:00:55.980> not<00:00:56.190> sure<00:00:56.309> what<00:00:56.430> this<00:00:56.520> is<00:00:56.579> RMS<00:00:57.030> I'm

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
rms I'm not sure what this is RMS I'm

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.110 
rms I'm not sure what this is RMS I'm
assuming<00:00:58.039> it's<00:00:59.039> marked<00:00:59.340> up<00:00:59.489> to<00:00:59.699> a<00:00:59.730> thousand

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
assuming it's marked up to a thousand

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.340 
assuming it's marked up to a thousand
watts<00:01:01.039> but<00:01:02.039> either<00:01:02.910> way<00:01:03.180> 200<00:01:03.989> more<00:01:04.140> watts

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
watts but either way 200 more watts

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.570 
watts but either way 200 more watts
total<00:01:05.840> the<00:01:06.840> alto<00:01:07.170> I<00:01:07.260> believe<00:01:07.650> has<00:01:07.920> a<00:01:07.950> one<00:01:08.369> inch

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
total the alto I believe has a one inch

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.030 
total the alto I believe has a one inch
high<00:01:08.790> frequency<00:01:09.150> driver<00:01:09.360> this<00:01:09.630> is<00:01:09.840> 1<00:01:10.229> and<00:01:10.409> 3/4

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
high frequency driver this is 1 and 3/4

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.170 
high frequency driver this is 1 and 3/4
inch<00:01:11.280> so<00:01:11.670> a<00:01:11.909> little<00:01:12.299> bit<00:01:12.420> larger<00:01:13.970> so<00:01:14.970> I'm<00:01:15.090> gonna

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
inch so a little bit larger so I'm gonna

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.710 
inch so a little bit larger so I'm gonna
go<00:01:15.330> ahead<00:01:15.570> and<00:01:15.810> unbox<00:01:16.439> this<00:01:16.710> here<00:01:17.009> and<00:01:17.390> then<00:01:18.390> I

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
go ahead and unbox this here and then I

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.999 
go ahead and unbox this here and then I
will<00:01:18.780> do<00:01:19.170> a<00:01:19.590> sound<00:01:20.549> test<00:01:20.840> and<00:01:21.840> hope<00:01:22.259> that<00:01:22.470> UMG

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
will do a sound test and hope that UMG

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.560 
will do a sound test and hope that UMG
doesn't<00:01:23.369> sue<00:01:23.520> me<00:01:23.640> here<00:01:24.180> we<00:01:24.270> go

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
doesn't sue me here we go

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.760 
doesn't sue me here we go
ok<00:01:25.530> so<00:01:26.369> let's<00:01:26.700> go<00:01:26.820> ahead<00:01:26.909> and<00:01:27.090> unbox<00:01:27.900> the<00:01:28.409> Alpha

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
ok so let's go ahead and unbox the Alpha

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:37.940 
ok so let's go ahead and unbox the Alpha
112

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.719 

so<00:01:38.950> inside<00:01:39.670> we<00:01:39.970> have<00:01:40.450> a<00:01:41.430> receipt<00:01:42.430> for<00:01:42.670> a

so inside we have a receipt for a

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:44.460 
so inside we have a receipt for a
musician's<00:01:43.150> friend<00:01:43.420> probably<00:01:43.900> don't<00:01:44.140> really

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:44.470 
musician's friend probably don't really

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:50.280 
musician's friend probably don't really
need<00:01:44.680> that<00:01:46.830> in<00:01:47.830> here<00:01:49.170> underneath<00:01:50.170> this

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:50.290 
need that in here underneath this

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:53.609 
need that in here underneath this
packing<00:01:50.710> material<00:01:51.300> we<00:01:52.300> have<00:01:52.540> the<00:01:53.170> actual

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:53.619 
packing material we have the actual

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:55.680 
packing material we have the actual
speaker<00:01:54.009> itself

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:55.690 
speaker itself

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:57.149 
speaker itself
first<00:01:55.990> impressions<00:01:56.500> it's<00:01:56.710> actually

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:57.159 
first impressions it's actually

00:01:57.159 --> 00:01:59.190 
first impressions it's actually
incredibly<00:01:57.610> light<00:01:57.850> I<00:01:58.060> believe<00:01:58.659> they<00:01:58.810> say<00:01:59.020> it's

00:01:59.190 --> 00:01:59.200 
incredibly light I believe they say it's

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.590 
incredibly light I believe they say it's
like<00:01:59.320> 39<00:01:59.650> pounds<00:01:59.920> it<00:02:00.400> feels<00:02:00.640> like<00:02:00.909> a<00:02:00.940> lot<00:02:01.240> less

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:01.600 
like 39 pounds it feels like a lot less

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.710 
like 39 pounds it feels like a lot less
it's<00:02:02.050> not<00:02:02.229> incredibly<00:02:02.740> dense<00:02:02.979> which<00:02:03.280> is<00:02:03.460> nice

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:03.720 
it's not incredibly dense which is nice

the<00:03:00.239> top<00:03:00.420> got<00:03:00.870> the<00:03:00.989> rigging<00:03:01.260> points<00:03:01.790> you<00:03:02.790> can

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
the top got the rigging points you can

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:04.190 
the top got the rigging points you can
actually<00:03:03.120> stack<00:03:03.510> another<00:03:03.750> one<00:03:03.989> of<00:03:04.110> these

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
actually stack another one of these

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:05.990 
actually stack another one of these
directly<00:03:04.829> on<00:03:04.980> top<00:03:05.159> of<00:03:05.190> it<00:03:05.489> I'm<00:03:05.610> not<00:03:05.730> quite<00:03:05.970> sure

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
directly on top of it I'm not quite sure

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.490 
directly on top of it I'm not quite sure
why<00:03:06.209> you<00:03:06.269> would<00:03:06.359> have<00:03:06.959> phase<00:03:07.170> issues

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
why you would have phase issues

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.330 
why you would have phase issues
everywhere<00:03:08.269> and<00:03:09.739> not<00:03:10.739> quite<00:03:10.890> sure<00:03:10.950> how<00:03:11.160> good

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
everywhere and not quite sure how good

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:12.740 
everywhere and not quite sure how good
that<00:03:11.459> would<00:03:11.579> sound<00:03:11.760> but<00:03:12.060> it's<00:03:12.359> there<00:03:12.569> if<00:03:12.720> you

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
that would sound but it's there if you

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.949 
that would sound but it's there if you
ever<00:03:13.160> hypothetically<00:03:14.160> needed<00:03:14.400> to<00:03:14.489> um<00:03:15.299> both

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 
ever hypothetically needed to um both

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:18.710 
ever hypothetically needed to um both
sides<00:03:16.230> are<00:03:16.560> roughly<00:03:17.099> the<00:03:17.190> same<00:03:17.280> you've<00:03:18.120> got<00:03:18.420> a

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
sides are roughly the same you've got a

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.550 
sides are roughly the same you've got a
handle<00:03:19.650> on<00:03:19.709> each<00:03:20.010> side<00:03:20.250> and<00:03:21.290> they<00:03:22.290> have<00:03:22.470> the

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
handle on each side and they have the

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.860 
handle on each side and they have the
capability<00:03:23.129> to<00:03:23.310> be<00:03:23.670> turned<00:03:23.970> on<00:03:24.329> their<00:03:24.629> side

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
capability to be turned on their side

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:28.369 
capability to be turned on their side
and<00:03:25.109> used<00:03:25.440> as<00:03:25.650> a<00:03:26.099> floor<00:03:26.970> monitor<00:03:27.299> come<00:03:28.140> on<00:03:28.230> over

00:03:28.369 --> 00:03:28.379 
and used as a floor monitor come on over

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:33.619 
and used as a floor monitor come on over
to<00:03:28.470> the<00:03:28.530> back<00:03:29.239> you<00:03:30.239> can<00:03:30.420> see<00:03:32.030> your<00:03:33.030> inputs<00:03:33.510> and

00:03:33.619 --> 00:03:33.629 
to the back you can see your inputs and

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:36.280 
to the back you can see your inputs and
outputs<00:03:33.900> and<00:03:34.109> your<00:03:34.950> volume<00:03:35.190> controls<00:03:35.489> now

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:36.290 
outputs and your volume controls now

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:38.030 
outputs and your volume controls now
something<00:03:37.290> to<00:03:37.349> keep<00:03:37.409> in<00:03:37.620> mind<00:03:37.769> with<00:03:37.950> these

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 
something to keep in mind with these

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:41.059 
something to keep in mind with these
volume<00:03:38.370> knobs<00:03:38.549> is<00:03:38.790> that<00:03:39.480> it's<00:03:40.200> not<00:03:40.440> just<00:03:40.470> 1<00:03:40.919> to

00:03:41.059 --> 00:03:41.069 
volume knobs is that it's not just 1 to

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:43.580 
volume knobs is that it's not just 1 to
10<00:03:41.250> when<00:03:42.180> you<00:03:42.269> plug<00:03:42.510> a<00:03:42.540> line<00:03:42.959> level<00:03:43.200> source

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
10 when you plug a line level source

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:48.640 
10 when you plug a line level source
into<00:03:43.889> this<00:03:44.099> you<00:03:44.819> basically<00:03:44.970> have<00:03:45.510> from<00:03:46.169> 0<00:03:46.829> to<00:03:47.549> 5

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:48.650 
into this you basically have from 0 to 5

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:56.449 
into this you basically have from 0 to 5
5<00:03:49.650> being<00:03:50.989> right<00:03:51.989> there<00:03:52.400> and<00:03:54.650> if<00:03:55.650> you<00:03:56.040> go<00:03:56.220> above

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:56.459 
5 being right there and if you go above

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:58.159 
5 being right there and if you go above
that<00:03:56.519> you<00:03:56.700> can<00:03:57.180> definitely<00:03:57.329> risk<00:03:57.810> blowing<00:03:57.930> the

00:03:58.159 --> 00:03:58.169 
that you can definitely risk blowing the

00:03:58.169 --> 00:04:01.369 
that you can definitely risk blowing the
speaker<00:03:59.030> now<00:04:00.030> when<00:04:00.239> your<00:04:00.419> plug<00:04:00.900> when<00:04:01.139> you<00:04:01.230> plug

00:04:01.369 --> 00:04:01.379 
speaker now when your plug when you plug

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:03.559 
speaker now when your plug when you plug
a<00:04:01.500> mic<00:04:01.709> directly<00:04:02.190> into<00:04:02.400> those<00:04:02.519> inputs<00:04:02.940> you

00:04:03.559 --> 00:04:03.569 
a mic directly into those inputs you

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:06.670 
a mic directly into those inputs you
have<00:04:03.599> a<00:04:03.750> full<00:04:04.079> range<00:04:04.260> so<00:04:04.799> 1<00:04:05.310> to<00:04:05.430> 10<00:04:05.609> this<00:04:06.209> is

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:06.680 
have a full range so 1 to 10 this is

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:09.080 
have a full range so 1 to 10 this is
what<00:04:07.680> a<00:04:07.709> lot<00:04:07.919> of<00:04:07.980> owners<00:04:08.669> of<00:04:08.760> the<00:04:08.849> alto

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090 
what a lot of owners of the alto

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:11.629 
what a lot of owners of the alto
speakers<00:04:09.449> don't<00:04:09.569> realize<00:04:10.310> and<00:04:11.310> so<00:04:11.430> if<00:04:11.519> you

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:11.639 
speakers don't realize and so if you

00:04:11.639 --> 00:04:13.339 
speakers don't realize and so if you
read<00:04:11.819> any<00:04:11.940> bad<00:04:12.150> reviews<00:04:12.510> of<00:04:12.629> the<00:04:12.690> alto<00:04:12.930> speaker

00:04:13.339 --> 00:04:13.349 
read any bad reviews of the alto speaker

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:15.920 
read any bad reviews of the alto speaker
a<00:04:13.530> lot<00:04:14.430> of<00:04:14.549> times<00:04:14.790> they'll<00:04:15.419> say<00:04:15.569> they<00:04:15.720> blew<00:04:15.900> it

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:15.930 
a lot of times they'll say they blew it

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:19.219 
a lot of times they'll say they blew it
yeah<00:04:16.590> that's<00:04:16.889> how<00:04:17.449> below<00:04:18.449> those<00:04:18.690> volume<00:04:19.049> knobs

00:04:19.219 --> 00:04:19.229 
yeah that's how below those volume knobs

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:22.219 
yeah that's how below those volume knobs
you<00:04:19.500> can<00:04:19.650> see<00:04:19.829> the<00:04:19.979> 2<00:04:20.250> inputs<00:04:20.870> so<00:04:21.870> we've<00:04:22.109> got

00:04:22.219 --> 00:04:22.229 
you can see the 2 inputs so we've got

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:25.730 
you can see the 2 inputs so we've got
XLR<00:04:22.860> quarter-inch<00:04:23.400> combo<00:04:23.699> jacks<00:04:24.110> over<00:04:25.110> here

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:25.740 
XLR quarter-inch combo jacks over here

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:28.909 
XLR quarter-inch combo jacks over here
we've<00:04:26.190> got<00:04:26.220> the<00:04:26.370> mix<00:04:26.669> out<00:04:26.910> which<00:04:27.419> is<00:04:27.660> just<00:04:28.080> XLR

00:04:28.909 --> 00:04:28.919 
we've got the mix out which is just XLR

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:31.520 
we've got the mix out which is just XLR
male<00:04:29.150> you<00:04:30.150> can<00:04:30.180> use<00:04:30.449> that<00:04:30.630> to<00:04:30.780> output<00:04:31.169> to

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:31.530 
male you can use that to output to

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:35.120 
male you can use that to output to
another<00:04:31.800> speaker<00:04:32.630> so<00:04:33.630> if<00:04:33.810> you<00:04:33.930> plugged<00:04:34.440> like

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:35.130 
another speaker so if you plugged like

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:38.060 
another speaker so if you plugged like
an<00:04:35.250> iPod<00:04:35.580> directly<00:04:36.449> in<00:04:36.539> here<00:04:36.840> you<00:04:37.770> can<00:04:37.919> take
