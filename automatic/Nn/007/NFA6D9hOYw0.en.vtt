00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.179
 do not 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:08.889
 hello how I hope you are 

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:11.320
 very very well this time I'm going to 

00:00:08.889 --> 00:00:14.440
 prepare a creamy lemon jelly 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:15.070
 It is a super fast and easy gelatin 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:17.470
 perform 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:19.210
 We are going to need a packet of 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:21.970
 gelatine of these that already come in the 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:23.890
 packet and taste lists are coming 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:26.710
 well I'm going to use the lemon flavor 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:29.260
 you can use the flavor that you have most 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:31.539
 please and the brand is already shown because 

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:33.010
 then some of you friends tell me 

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:35.980
 who do not know what I'm talking about 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:38.829
 well this area comes prepared the one 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:41.280
 if I do not recommend you, it's that you use those 

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:43.630
 stickers that set before cooling 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.480
 that does not work for this dessert 

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:49.950
 it's going too we're going to need 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:52.719
 a tin of led of this evaporated milk 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:55.539
 but this can you have to put in the 

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:58.050
 freezer about three days before 

00:00:55.539 --> 00:01:02.600
 prepare the recipe and we will need 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:04.610
 a mold that is greased and frozen 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.140
 for my friends who do not know how to 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:09.979
 does this procedure to oil the 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:12.740
 mold in yogurt jelly video 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:14.960
 with pineapple and blueberries, I'll show you how 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:16.070
 I'm going to put a little note so that you 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.550
 see 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:22.670
 how is that how it is done is good 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:24.790
 The first thing we are going to do is empty 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:27.870
 our liter of water 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:27.870
 and put the light 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:36.930
 and while the water boils we continue 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:39.220
 leaving our our mold and our 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.140
 milk in the freezer 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:44.570
 the liter of water is boiling already 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:46.820
 I'm going to pay now I'm going to add it 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:49.600
 the gelatin bit by bit so that this does not 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:49.600
 is going to spill 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:55.159
 I saw that it was not spilled then and the 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:58.280
 added all 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:02:00.350
 because sometimes if we empty it that way 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.300
 spills good and you have to dissolve the very 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:06.560
 very good 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:09.670
 and since it's dissolved we 're going to leave it to 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:12.950
 that is completely cold without curdling 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:15.550
 after a few minutes the gelatin is 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:19.750
 completely cold without coming to fruition 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:23.860
 now in a container we are going to add 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:23.860
 the milk that is frozen 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.120
 let's get the milk 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:48.880
 good as our milk goes 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.880
 frozen that looks more like an ice cream 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.910
 a vanilla ice cream 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:02.090
 I already have milk here in the container 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:02.090
 and with the blender we are going to beat it 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:13.210
 I'm right now with level 1 in the 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:15.910
 blender so that it is falling apart 

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:18.110
 the pieces that is so convenient 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:21.610
 and look 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:21.610
 Now I'm going to follow the flow 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:32.880
 and in the high power 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:32.880
 until you have people 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:36.960
 and stop beating 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:10.790
 at speed 

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:10.790
 so that not so much 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:24.320
 and why 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:36.420
 the story was integrated into the 

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:39.300
 gelatin with the milk once 

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:41.700
 we have our gelatin integrated with 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:43.910
 the milk we are going to empty it into our boat 

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:48.760
 or what you have 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:48.760
 look how the jelly rendered 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:54.479
 now we are going to put it in the refrigerator 

00:04:52.039 --> 00:04:57.180
 until it's completely curdled 

00:04:54.479 --> 00:05:00.660
 how much did he have left 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:03.690
 gelatin I have these two singles 

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:06.750
 also not to lubricate and put them to 

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:10.100
 freezer because I'm going to apply here more 

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:10.100
 well I'm going to add what apply 

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:19.900
 and I repeat again you can put the 

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:23.440
 flavor you want to gelatin 

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:25.540
 it is not necessary the lemon are already 

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:27.550
 these individual and the same we're going 

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:29.680
 to put in the refrigerator until they are 

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:31.360
 lists who have seen the video of 

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:33.280
 Side pie is the same 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:36.419
 procedure that we did in that 

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:39.190
 cake except for the cookie crust 

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:43.060
 after a few hours and gelatin 

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:45.970
 we are going to empty the to our tray 

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:49.680
 mold what you have you know we're going to 

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:54.660
 put our put on and we turn 

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:57.300
 as it is oiled it comes out easily 

00:05:54.660 --> 00:06:01.080
 and here is what happened to me 

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:03.750
 tell them at the beginning was the breakthrough this is 

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:07.080
 a drink that has some alcohol 

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:10.050
 but not much only has 12.5 

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:11.940
 degrees of alcohol this then also it 

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:13.500
 add in some desserts we have 

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:16.440
 added in rice pudding 

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:17.910
 well no other jelly and it's here if you 

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:21.480
 you want to put the rambo but you can 

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:24.090
 do if not so the individual looks 

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:26.550
 exam and vivanda if you want to leave it in 

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:29.460
 you can do the cup or also the 

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:32.040
 we can put a little dish we put 

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:34.240
 this exterior will cost us a little 

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:36.099
 to work it out 

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:40.590
 What we can do is that with a 

00:06:36.099 --> 00:06:40.590
 knife only around 

00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:46.889
 we put 

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:51.659
 and that's where our gelatin comes out or leave it in 

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:55.180
 the cup as you want 

00:06:51.659 --> 00:06:57.849
 Single or gelatin large as 

00:06:55.180 --> 00:07:00.909
 we have our jelly to say this 

00:06:57.849 --> 00:07:05.159
 I'm not going to leave, we're going to bathe with 

00:07:00.909 --> 00:07:05.159
 break our gelatin 

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:14.689
 How are you 

00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:18.789
 you foresee you choose if you want it 

00:07:14.689 --> 00:07:21.769
 to the natural gelatin of lemon or with breaks 

00:07:18.789 --> 00:07:25.189
 I hope this recipe is to your liking 

00:07:21.769 --> 00:07:28.200
 and if you like them I invite you to 

00:07:25.189 --> 00:07:30.990

00:07:46.179 --> 00:07:52.749
 gelatine that looks more like a mousse 

00:07:48.479 --> 00:07:54.550
 Gelatine you liked my love themselves very much a 

00:07:52.749 --> 00:07:57.910
