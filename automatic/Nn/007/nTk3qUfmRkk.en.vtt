00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
I'm going to take this one out just to

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.240 
I'm going to take this one out just to
show<00:00:58.800> you<00:00:58.859> guys<00:01:00.440> so<00:01:01.440> here's<00:01:01.710> the<00:01:01.829> mouthpiece

show you guys so here's the mouthpiece

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.910 
show you guys so here's the mouthpiece
and<00:01:02.520> you<00:01:02.609> can<00:01:02.730> see<00:01:02.879> that<00:01:03.059> it<00:01:03.270> has<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:04.140> vents<00:01:04.799> in

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.980 
and you can see that it has the vents in
it<00:01:05.070> and<00:01:05.220> it's<00:01:05.640> got<00:01:05.729> the<00:01:05.880> solid<00:01:06.090> portion<00:01:06.570> in<00:01:06.869> it

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
it and it's got the solid portion in it

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.870 
it and it's got the solid portion in it

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
so it actually is a little bit

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.149 
so it actually is a little bit
intimidating<00:01:09.119> I<00:01:09.630> thought<00:01:10.020> before<00:01:10.320> I<00:01:10.560> went

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
intimidating I thought before I went

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.520 
intimidating I thought before I went
ahead<00:01:11.280> and<00:01:11.460> molded<00:01:12.240> it<00:01:12.360> but<00:01:12.600> once<00:01:13.170> I<00:01:13.260> did<00:01:13.439> it

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
ahead and molded it but once I did it

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.920 
ahead and molded it but once I did it
was<00:01:13.740> super<00:01:14.010> easy<00:01:14.130> so<00:01:14.580> the<00:01:15.060> instructions<00:01:15.659> tell

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
was super easy so the instructions tell

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.270 
was super easy so the instructions tell
you<00:01:16.049> the<00:01:16.200> first<00:01:16.320> thing<00:01:16.590> you<00:01:16.680> can<00:01:16.770> do<00:01:16.920> is<00:01:17.100> watch

that you can take a spoon or you know a

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.679 
that you can take a spoon or you know a
spatula<00:01:35.970> to<00:01:36.570> set<00:01:37.350> this<00:01:37.590> in<00:01:37.829> the<00:01:38.040> boiling<00:01:38.340> water

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:38.689 
spatula to set this in the boiling water

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:41.719 
spatula to set this in the boiling water

so once the water is boiling you're

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.639 
so once the water is boiling you're
going<00:01:41.759> to<00:01:41.880> turn<00:01:42.150> it<00:01:42.270> off<00:01:42.420> right<00:01:42.810> so<00:01:43.320> when<00:01:43.560> you

going to turn it off right so when you

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:44.840 
going to turn it off right so when you
put<00:01:43.799> this<00:01:43.890> in<00:01:44.070> there<00:01:44.220> the<00:01:44.340> water<00:01:44.460> should<00:01:44.790> not

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
put this in there the water should not

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.359 
put this in there the water should not
be<00:01:45.060> on<00:01:45.540> a<00:01:45.600> flame<00:01:46.170> at<00:01:46.409> all<00:01:46.590> then<00:01:47.159> you're<00:01:47.220> going

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
be on a flame at all then you're going

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.670 
be on a flame at all then you're going
to<00:01:47.460> take<00:01:47.790> the<00:01:48.149> spatula<00:01:48.720> and<00:01:48.869> you're<00:01:49.439> going<00:01:49.590> to

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
to take the spatula and you're going to

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.100 
to take the spatula and you're going to
put<00:01:49.799> this<00:01:49.920> on<00:01:50.100> it<00:01:50.250> like<00:01:50.369> this<00:01:50.520> and<00:01:50.790> it<00:01:51.450> hold<00:01:51.990> it

put this on it like this and it hold it
in<00:01:52.259> the<00:01:52.380> water<00:01:53.060> there's<00:01:54.060> not<00:01:54.270> a<00:01:54.299> specific<00:01:54.509> time

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
in the water there's not a specific time

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.510 
in the water there's not a specific time
that<00:01:55.170> you<00:01:55.229> have<00:01:55.320> to<00:01:55.439> hold<00:01:55.619> it<00:01:55.860> I<00:01:55.979> wouldn't<00:01:56.280> say

this as an example you know this will

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.800 
this as an example you know this will
start<00:02:42.390> out<00:02:42.510> as<00:02:42.599> a<00:02:42.660> flat<00:02:42.780> piece<00:02:43.050> I<00:02:43.349> put<00:02:44.069> it<00:02:44.190> in<00:02:44.310> I

guards<00:02:58.860> form<00:02:59.099> so<00:02:59.400> the<00:03:00.239> interesting<00:03:00.450> thing

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
guards form so the interesting thing

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:02.270 
guards form so the interesting thing
about<00:03:00.780> this<00:03:01.140> is<00:03:01.200> that<00:03:01.380> it's<00:03:01.650> two<00:03:01.769> point<00:03:02.069> four

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
about this is that it's two point four

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.280 
about this is that it's two point four
millimeters<00:03:03.000> and<00:03:03.030> they<00:03:03.299> offer<00:03:03.420> two<00:03:03.750> types<00:03:04.019> one

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
millimeters and they offer two types one

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.080 
millimeters and they offer two types one
that's<00:03:04.830> one<00:03:04.980> point<00:03:05.130> six<00:03:05.430> and<00:03:05.640> one<00:03:05.790> that's<00:03:05.970> two

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
that's one point six and one that's two

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:08.089 
that's one point six and one that's two
point<00:03:06.299> four<00:03:06.540> and<00:03:06.780> those<00:03:07.590> are<00:03:07.739> the<00:03:07.830> different

00:03:08.089 --> 00:03:08.099 
point four and those are the different

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:09.890 
point four and those are the different
thicknesses<00:03:08.519> so<00:03:08.580> the<00:03:09.239> one<00:03:09.360> for<00:03:09.540> football

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
thicknesses so the one for football

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.300 
thicknesses so the one for football
you're<00:03:10.140> going<00:03:10.319> to<00:03:10.380> go<00:03:10.500> for<00:03:10.769> the<00:03:10.920> two<00:03:11.069> point

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
you're going to go for the two point

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.910 
you're going to go for the two point
four<00:03:11.549> millimeter<00:03:12.209> one<00:03:12.450> and<00:03:12.810> that's<00:03:13.140> this

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
four millimeter one and that's this

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
four on it so now let's talk about now

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:21.650 
four on it so now let's talk about now
that<00:03:20.070> you<00:03:20.160> have<00:03:20.280> formed<00:03:20.670> the<00:03:21.390> actual

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660 
that you have formed the actual

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:23.900 
that you have formed the actual
performance<00:03:21.840> of<00:03:22.230> it<00:03:22.350> it's<00:03:22.530> extremely<00:03:23.340> thin

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
performance of it it's extremely thin

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:26.000 
performance of it it's extremely thin
it's<00:03:24.420> extremely<00:03:24.930> lightweight<00:03:25.170> and<00:03:25.530> they

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
it's extremely lightweight and they

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:28.039 
it's extremely lightweight and they
claim<00:03:26.220> that<00:03:26.250> you<00:03:26.430> can<00:03:26.640> eat<00:03:26.910> or<00:03:27.209> sorry<00:03:27.690> not<00:03:27.750> eat

00:03:28.039 --> 00:03:28.049 
claim that you can eat or sorry not eat

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:29.270 
claim that you can eat or sorry not eat
but<00:03:28.230> you<00:03:28.260> can<00:03:28.440> talk<00:03:28.620> and<00:03:28.829> you<00:03:28.890> can<00:03:28.950> breathe<00:03:29.220> and

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
but you can talk and you can breathe and

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.069 
but you can talk and you can breathe and
you<00:03:29.459> can<00:03:29.609> drink<00:03:29.819> with<00:03:30.269> the<00:03:30.569> mouthpiece<00:03:30.750> and

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:31.079 
you can drink with the mouthpiece and

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:32.449 
you can drink with the mouthpiece and
that's<00:03:31.560> something<00:03:31.829> that<00:03:31.950> definitely<00:03:32.100> found

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
that's something that definitely found

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:34.610 
that's something that definitely found
be<00:03:32.670> able<00:03:32.880> to<00:03:32.970> be<00:03:33.090> true<00:03:33.359> it<00:03:33.780> wasn't<00:03:34.200> blocking

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
be able to be true it wasn't blocking

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:37.490 
be able to be true it wasn't blocking
any<00:03:35.040> of<00:03:35.310> my<00:03:35.819> pathways<00:03:36.299> at<00:03:36.450> all<00:03:36.569> and<00:03:36.810> actually<00:03:37.290> I

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
any of my pathways at all and actually I

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.800 
any of my pathways at all and actually I
think<00:03:37.620> in<00:03:38.160> this<00:03:38.340> one<00:03:38.579> that<00:03:38.850> when<00:03:39.420> I<00:03:39.450> did<00:03:39.660> the

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
think in this one that when I did the

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:40.400 
think in this one that when I did the
sucking<00:03:40.109> motion

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410 
sucking motion

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:43.160 
sucking motion
I<00:03:40.500> sucked<00:03:40.799> too<00:03:41.040> hard<00:03:41.340> and<00:03:41.609> it<00:03:42.269> forms<00:03:42.720> too<00:03:42.959> well

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:43.170 
I sucked too hard and it forms too well

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:46.009 
I sucked too hard and it forms too well
so<00:03:43.410> it's<00:03:43.590> such<00:03:43.829> a<00:03:43.859> tight<00:03:44.190> fit<00:03:44.630> I'm<00:03:45.630> gonna<00:03:45.870> put

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:46.019 
so it's such a tight fit I'm gonna put

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:54.110 
so it's such a tight fit I'm gonna put
in<00:03:46.109> for<00:03:46.260> you<00:03:46.350> guys<00:03:48.920> and<00:03:50.269> there<00:03:51.269> it<00:03:51.389> is<00:03:51.739> so<00:03:53.120> you

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:55.709 
can almost you almost can't even tell

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:57.289

that<00:03:56.280> I<00:03:56.310> have<00:03:56.459> again<00:03:56.670> one<00:03:56.880> of<00:03:56.910> the<00:03:57.000> mouth<00:03:57.120> is

00:03:57.289 --> 00:03:57.299 
that I have again one of the mouth is

00:03:57.299 --> 00:04:01.729 
that I have again one of the mouth is
closed<00:03:57.630> and<00:03:58.970> you<00:03:59.970> see<00:04:00.150> that<00:04:00.239> I<00:04:00.299> can<00:04:00.540> talk<00:04:00.930> and<00:04:01.230> I

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:01.739 
closed and you see that I can talk and I

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:03.860 
closed and you see that I can talk and I
can<00:04:01.920> breathe<00:04:02.100> very<00:04:03.030> easily<00:04:03.329> with<00:04:03.690> it

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:03.870 
can breathe very easily with it

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:06.680 
can breathe very easily with it
obviously<00:04:04.590> my<00:04:05.090> speeches<00:04:06.090> and<00:04:06.269> peep<00:04:06.480> it<00:04:06.660> a

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:06.690 
obviously my speeches and peep it a

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:08.720 
obviously my speeches and peep it a
little<00:04:06.900> bit<00:04:07.139> but<00:04:07.650> that's<00:04:07.829> because<00:04:08.010> it<00:04:08.340> I<00:04:08.519> mean

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730 
little bit but that's because it I mean

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:10.640 
little bit but that's because it I mean
there's<00:04:09.000> a<00:04:09.060> mouth<00:04:09.239> guard<00:04:09.269> but<00:04:09.690> by<00:04:10.200> far<00:04:10.470> I<00:04:10.500> think

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.650 
there's a mouth guard but by far I think

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:12.140 
there's a mouth guard but by far I think
this<00:04:10.950> is<00:04:11.069> the<00:04:11.160> mouth<00:04:11.340> guard<00:04:11.519> that<00:04:11.700> I<00:04:11.730> can<00:04:11.910> speak

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
this is the mouth guard that I can speak

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:14.569 
this is the mouth guard that I can speak
the<00:04:12.600> best<00:04:12.840> with<00:04:13.109> I<00:04:13.290> think<00:04:13.530> or<00:04:13.950> I<00:04:13.980> hope<00:04:14.220> most<00:04:14.459> of

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:14.579 
the best with I think or I hope most of

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:16.699 
the best with I think or I hope most of
you<00:04:14.700> can<00:04:14.850> understand<00:04:15.299> me<00:04:15.480> so<00:04:16.109> now<00:04:16.260> when<00:04:16.590> I<00:04:16.620> told

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:16.709 
you can understand me so now when I told

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:18.229 
you can understand me so now when I told
you<00:04:16.950> I<00:04:17.039> think<00:04:17.160> I<00:04:17.400> formed<00:04:17.729> it<00:04:17.820> too<00:04:18.000> tight

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:18.239 
you I think I formed it too tight

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:20.449 
you I think I formed it too tight
because<00:04:18.269> I<00:04:18.690> shot<00:04:18.930> too<00:04:19.169> hard<00:04:19.440> this<00:04:20.130> is<00:04:20.280> how<00:04:20.430> I

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:20.459 
because I shot too hard this is how I

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:24.380 
because I shot too hard this is how I
have<00:04:20.639> to<00:04:20.760> take<00:04:20.970> it<00:04:21.090> out<00:04:21.209> you<00:04:23.090> can<00:04:24.090> hear<00:04:24.240> that

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:24.390 
have to take it out you can hear that

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:26.760 
have to take it out you can hear that
click<00:04:24.720> because<00:04:25.260> it's<00:04:25.409> that<00:04:25.560> tight<00:04:25.830> it's<00:04:26.070> that

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:26.770 
click because it's that tight it's that

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:29.129 
click because it's that tight it's that
of<00:04:26.830> a<00:04:26.919> custom<00:04:27.310> thing<00:04:27.550> so<00:04:28.509> I<00:04:28.539> do<00:04:28.660> think<00:04:28.960> this<00:04:29.080> is

00:04:29.129 --> 00:04:29.139 
of a custom thing so I do think this is

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:30.749 
of a custom thing so I do think this is
a<00:04:29.169> great<00:04:29.410> mouth<00:04:29.650> guard<00:04:29.979> for<00:04:30.250> the<00:04:30.310> price<00:04:30.520> and

00:04:30.749 --> 00:04:30.759 
a great mouth guard for the price and

00:04:30.759 --> 00:04:32.909 
a great mouth guard for the price and
the<00:04:31.240> best<00:04:31.539> part<00:04:31.780> about<00:04:31.960> it<00:04:32.139> is<00:04:32.259> that<00:04:32.410> if<00:04:32.590> it's

00:04:32.909 --> 00:04:32.919 
the best part about it is that if it's

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:34.740 
the best part about it is that if it's
too<00:04:33.099> tight<00:04:33.129> you<00:04:33.819> can<00:04:33.970> actually<00:04:34.090> remould<00:04:34.599> it

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:34.750 
too tight you can actually remould it

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:36.450 
too tight you can actually remould it
and<00:04:34.870> this<00:04:34.990> is<00:04:35.110> the<00:04:35.139> first<00:04:35.680> mouth<00:04:35.949> guard<00:04:36.220> where

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:36.460 
and this is the first mouth guard where

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:38.100 
and this is the first mouth guard where
I<00:04:36.729> actually<00:04:37.270> think<00:04:37.599> it's<00:04:37.750> completely

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:38.110 
I actually think it's completely

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:40.200 
I actually think it's completely
moldable<00:04:38.620> so<00:04:38.919> if<00:04:39.370> you<00:04:39.520> were<00:04:39.639> going<00:04:39.759> to<00:04:39.819> remould

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:40.210 
moldable so if you were going to remould

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:41.939 
moldable so if you were going to remould
it<00:04:40.360> are<00:04:41.199> you<00:04:41.379> going<00:04:41.500> to<00:04:41.560> do<00:04:41.650> is<00:04:41.770> you're<00:04:41.860> going

00:04:41.939 --> 00:04:41.949 
it are you going to do is you're going

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:43.800 
it are you going to do is you're going
to<00:04:42.009> take<00:04:42.190> this<00:04:42.370> with<00:04:42.639> a<00:04:42.669> spatula<00:04:42.909> you<00:04:43.720> know

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:43.810 
to take this with a spatula you know

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:44.969 
to take this with a spatula you know
heat<00:04:44.050> up<00:04:44.139> the<00:04:44.229> water<00:04:44.379> just<00:04:44.650> as<00:04:44.770> you<00:04:44.860> will

00:04:44.969 --> 00:04:44.979 
heat up the water just as you will

00:04:44.979 --> 00:04:46.529 
heat up the water just as you will
before<00:04:45.280> you're<00:04:45.879> going<00:04:45.970> to<00:04:46.060> set<00:04:46.240> it<00:04:46.360> in<00:04:46.449> the

00:04:46.529 --> 00:04:46.539 
before you're going to set it in the

00:04:46.539 --> 00:04:48.270 
before you're going to set it in the
water<00:04:46.720> and<00:04:47.020> every<00:04:47.650> 10<00:04:47.830> seconds<00:04:48.069> you're<00:04:48.129> going

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:48.280 
water and every 10 seconds you're going

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:49.230 
water and every 10 seconds you're going
to<00:04:48.340> take<00:04:48.490> it<00:04:48.610> out<00:04:48.699> and<00:04:48.849> you're<00:04:48.940> just<00:04:49.060> going<00:04:49.180> to

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:49.240
