00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 the high school boys 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.790
 scares they demonstrated today in a 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.010
 peaceful procession that has crossed the 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.389
 streets of atessa and have demonstrated 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.219
 especially against school cuts 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.290
 and more generally against the crisis that 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.809
 is gripping Italy and more in 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.160
 general the globe with the future of the 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.810
 young people increasingly in the balance is 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.029
 also need some form of 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.010
 protest but above all that it is peaceful 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.410
 federica caporella one of the three 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.480
 school representatives explains to us 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.449
 reasons that led these guys 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.080
 to participate in numerous initiatives 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:32.969
 save and good morning 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.800
 first of all I would like to thank you anyway 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:38.160
 all the guys who believed in it 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.809
 this demonstration and we protest 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.940
 against the cuts that are anyway 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:45.629
 are performing on the institution 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:47.820
 education is known of that education 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.829
 it is a right in no one can deny 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.770
 other rights to other people then 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:55.590
 we don't want starting from maybe 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.390
 this law will come to you will come back 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.699
 more than anything a true distinction between 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.770
 rich and poor where perhaps the son of 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:05.299
 dad will study while the son of 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:08.549
 poor worker will not be able to do anyway 

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:09.810
 show your own skills 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.400
 mattia marcolongo another gods 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:15.960
 representatives which are yours 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:18.060
 proposals to our proposals if they are 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.759
 those of improving our future e 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:23.790
 that is, we demand culture like you 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:26.840
 as I all think and we can 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.950
 deny anyone and how she said 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.990
 will bring the school conceals 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.430
 they will then privatize one 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.049
 school only to the rich and poor not there 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.049
 it's up to nothing 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:38.490
 we demand only more culture and less 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:41.340
 only ignorance in schools 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.860
 we demand and if this does not happen here 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.240
 what will happen whenever 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.540
 who try to make a law against 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.159
 we 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.990
 and then our rights and lines 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.240
 caporrella back to you because in 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.119
 slogans spoke of self-management that 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.770
 what is meant by self-management 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:57.329
 then well self-managed despite many 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.130
 may think it is only one 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:00.810
 stop period from the study 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.509
 actually we want to show that 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.159
 we have the ability to self manage us is 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:07.799
 that we are not however a mass of 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:09.840
 ignorant and therefore we want to show i 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:12.870
 our values and our true interest 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.159
 that is towards our future 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.870
 we didn't come here to skip one 

00:02:14.159 --> 00:02:17.099
 school day but to try to 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.049
 make us feel 

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:20.879
 we are on a small town we are at 

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:24.390
 barely 300 students of ours 

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:26.489
 school but I think that through small 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.510
 movements in small towns that 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:29.159
 however, they occur simultaneously 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.709
 we still manage to arouse 

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:33.989
 public attention 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:36.659
 you believe in the future of the school in 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:37.980
 italy or as many say they prefer 

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:42.000
 emigrate abroad 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:43.860
 oh well now as I think that emigrate 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:48.599
 abroad is the best thing 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:50.640
 but it is not not necessary to eliminate the 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:52.739
 proposal for change because anyway 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.480
 you can always change 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:56.760
 how can you go in the worst part 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.500
 it can also be improved and we can 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.359
 through our events and 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:03.209
 however showing our truth 

00:03:00.359 --> 00:03:04.019
 interest we try to improve 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:06.629
 what's this 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:08.670
 this event also serves in the 

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:10.530
 your intent to interest the world 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:11.879
 of the policy that must then take the 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:15.120
 major decisions 

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:17.400
 what we ask in concrete we ask 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:19.709
 however, to leave the school alone 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:21.359
 in the sense that already an institution with 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:22.769
 many problems if they come to cut us 

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:23.669
 even the funds we are not we do not know 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:26.430
 more what to do 

00:03:23.669 --> 00:03:27.840
 they say they say so much that we are the 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:30.239
 future but if you do not mention an education 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:32.579
 what future we can afford you drive 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:34.290
 sparrowhaws what I mean 

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:37.590
 I confirm everything they said 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:40.470
 who said caporrella marcolongo and that 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:43.230
 especially for political purposes there 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:44.449
 they must exploit people who 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:47.299
 they are above us 

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:49.680
 everything here is enough 

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:51.419
 exploited for many other things 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:54.690
 now they must also exploit us 

00:03:51.419 --> 00:03:57.319
 for for example the province and for 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:57.319
 many other reasons
