comfortable inside my house but I

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:27.009 
comfortable inside my house but I

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
and I figure there's other people that

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:30.070 
and I figure there's other people that
may<00:02:28.730> have<00:02:28.879> some<00:02:29.030> of<00:02:29.090> the<00:02:29.180> same<00:02:29.330> concerns<00:02:29.720> I<00:02:29.900> did

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 
may have some of the same concerns I did
