00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:06.690
 It looks like this now 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.490
 Ust-Ilimsky airport agree 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.830
 the picture is unsightly difficult to imagine 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.200
 people whose hand was raised to destroy 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.120
 building this could have been avoided however 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.039
 what's done is done but looks like 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.320
 soon everything will change here 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.810
 airport recovery interested 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.119
 local and regional authorities 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.810
 a municipal government was created a week ago 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.029
 company 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.640
 Ust-Ilimsk airport of work which 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.369
 plenty to do 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:34.820
 the initial stage is the landing pad 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:36.899
 why because it is easier tolerances 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:39.360
 certain reduced that is kilometer 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:41.730
 our task is in the same stage 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:45.539
 the acquisition of pasta pasta protection of 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:47.370
 will mean to determine the hall 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:50.690
 waiting for it to be small because 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:54.120
 that the daughter himself precipitation so on 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:56.309
 design event or 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:00.270
 innovative passports are ready 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:01.770
 almost ready and purchase minimum 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.320
 the equipment set is copper and 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.210
 equipment and radio to a friend on 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.310
 A new date has applied 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.380
 markings on the landing site therefore 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.540
 reckless drivers and other car enthusiasts requests 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.220
 refrain from driving in this area 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.770
 otherwise you will have to produce again 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.460
 painting and another task 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:19.470
 airlines not to allow on 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.810
 airport territory outsiders 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.670
 Today all the objects that 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.960
 here they are located 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.000
 municipal property of the city 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.290
 Ust-Ilimsk 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.299
 if before they could be somehow 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.860
 were considered abandoned or someone considered 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:35.329
 they have an owner today 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:37.710
 so I want to warn everyone 

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:41.009
 bad people who will try 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:44.509
 from here something to take away that further them 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:46.950
 no relationship will have with the authorities with 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:49.079
 city ​​administration from the police from 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:52.770
 prosecutors and so please leave everything 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:54.899
 this thing is all these language and on 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.210
 stealing property report 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:59.159
 the main problem of course is the building from 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.619
 which as we can see only ruins 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:03.110
 the former terminal is likely to be 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:05.640
 demolished since to restore it 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:07.979
 will need huge cash 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.800
 which simply is not the room where the old 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.170
 times were located fire and 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.209
 emergency rescue camp 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:14.770
 you can still save funding 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:16.120
 airport recovery will be 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:18.550
 produced from various budgets 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.870
 levels and group or pledged them 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:23.170
 development program 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:25.989
 7 million do not know how realistic 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:29.350
 We work and generally think minimum 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:31.780
 the costs here will be well in the area on 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:33.970
 100 million by the way objects will be 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.830
 guarded the first planes take off from 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:37.630
 local airport is tentatively in 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:39.370
 end of August of this year in the plans 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:43.330
 implementation of flights to Irkutsk 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:48.180
 Krasnoyarsk Novosibirsk on l-410 an-28 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:51.010
 and caravan if subsidized 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:54.390
 or federal or regional 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:57.190
 then somewhere around the fare 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:58.239
 well just below the cube and at least us 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:00.880
 as long as it says 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:02.890
 show companies that are willing to fly like 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:04.930
 We see the beginning we want to believe that 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:06.760
 Ust-Ilimsk Airport will earn and 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:08.250
 again will give citizens the opportunity 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:11.910
 move through the air 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:15.370
 really hope for help and 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:16.870
 businessmen ordinary citizens help 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:20.230
 it does not have to be expressed 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:22.269
 so much in the money it can be expressed and 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:25.989
 in some kind of help 

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:28.150
 help technique help materials i 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:30.519
 I think that the common efforts of the common people 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:33.160
 building with the help of the regional administration 

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:34.510
 cities and districts we will be able to deliver this 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.609
 airport again on the wing
