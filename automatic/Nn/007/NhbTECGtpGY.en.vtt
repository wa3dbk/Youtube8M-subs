00:00:10.077 --> 00:00:18.077
To make this delicious easy cake we'll need:
Maria cookies, butter, 
 and a bit of milk for the base.

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:40.500
150gr of white chocolate, 150gr of milk chocolate, 150gr of dark chocolate. 750ml of milk, 
 750ml of cream, 3 bags of curd, 150gr of sugar, and some decorative chocolate.

00:00:41.981 --> 00:00:50.981
First of all we gonna make the cake's base, for that we 
 will grind cookies and we put it on a crusher.

00:00:51.280 --> 00:01:06.280
If we don't have crusher, we can grind them with a 
 spin over a newspapper until we get it powdered.

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:11.400
We grind them and pour aside in a bowl

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:21.000
We put 60gr of butter in a bowl that we gonna put 
 into the microwave for about 2-3 minutes at low temperature.

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.540
If butter is melted at high temperature it becomes damaged

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
We add the melted butter to the cookies.

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:35.040
We mix it until we get an homogeneous mixture.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
If it is dry, we can add a bit of milk

00:01:39.496 --> 00:01:45.000
Pour the mixture into the round mold

00:01:45.233 --> 00:01:53.230
we plain to fill up the base and prevent 
 the liquids to get out the mold.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:04.000
We have to fill all the base and make it uniform thickness.

00:02:04.248 --> 00:02:08.250
We start with the dark chocolate coat:

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:19.000
150gr dark chocolate
250ml cream
250ml milk
50gr sugar
1 bag of curd

00:02:19.588 --> 00:02:29.590
We gonna heat at medium temperature and we can't stop stiring, until we 
 get an homogeneous chocolate cream. Be care that it doesn't boil.

00:02:30.698 --> 00:02:36.700
We pour over the cookie coat. And start making next one:

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:51.000
150gr milk chocolate
250ml cream
250ml milk
50gr sugar
1 bag of curd

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:56.000
we can't stop stiring, until we get an homogeneous chocolate cream

00:02:56.361 --> 00:03:11.360
We pour over the dark chocolate coat, with the spoon trick 
 to smooth the fall, And start making next one:

00:03:16.301 --> 00:03:20.300
The Last coat (White chocolate):

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:42.000
250ml cream
250ml milk
50gr sugar (optional, because it's already sweet)
1 bag of curd
150gr white chocolate

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:48.540
Stir until we get an homogeneous chocolate cream. Be care that it doesn't boil

00:03:49.066 --> 00:03:54.070
Pour over the second coat, with the spoon trick.

00:03:54.840 --> 00:04:03.840
We let it temper, and when it's cool we 
 put into the fridge until next day.

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:19.340
We quit the ring, and we can decorate it as 
 we wish. I used a little chocolate eggs.

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:30.320
Hope you like it, i'm sure that you gonna triumph wherever 
 you'll do. See you on next video, Bye !
