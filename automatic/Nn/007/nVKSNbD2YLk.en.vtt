00:00:00.609 --> 00:00:03.609
 Forever people 

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:21.829
 Of Nagareyama City, Chiba Prefecture 

00:00:21.829 --> 00:00:25.789
 Approximately 150,000 people who function as a bedtown in the metropolitan area 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:28.989
 It was 

00:00:28.989 --> 00:00:32.220
 Ohtakanomori located in the center of the city 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:36.040
 Kinoe crossing Tsukuba Express and Tobu Noda Line 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:37.320
 Near Kino 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.320
 Do you have any plan for the first season of the season? 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:45.080
 Here, focusing on the setup budget 

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:46.730
 I used cell tissue 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:51.060
 We developed a system with innovative data that achieved long-term storage 

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:58.170
 Received a special award in the product technology development department of the Japan Prize for Manufacturing 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.560
 did 

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:03.800
 Traffic regulation 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.130
 I told you that it was different 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:08.110
 How becoming it 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:10.990
 Again he will be good 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:13.990
 Because it is from the conventional measuring equipment 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:16.160
 Ariga 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.770
 We have consistently engaged in research and development since our founding 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:20.660
 Or 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:24.030
 It is completely different from the conventional concept of refrigeration technology 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.100
 Save the last alive 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.160
 cellular ride system 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:31.160
 In other words, it is a technology named opportunity 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:38.670
 The conventional quick freezing blows the direct cold wind which went to the food 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.260
 Light up 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.430
 Freezing starts from the surface 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:46.020
 While water molecule in the area is mentioned about construction of the outside 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.670
 I went in the court 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.840
 This water movement caused damage to the cell membrane 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:56.150
 If you extract umami ingredients from this article 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:59.800
 Has become part of it and it tastes down 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:03.700
 For example 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:05.760
 Phase takes about 40 years 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:07.580
 The best pair 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:10.309
 It was made not to be high 

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:13.089
 If you focus on the table 

00:02:13.089 --> 00:02:14.059
 The criminal is 

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:17.079
 Offer without damaging the attack until the end 

00:02:17.079 --> 00:02:21.110
 At one time it disappeared from the game and firstly the talk of the former president is one 

00:02:21.109 --> 00:02:23.979
 It became a hint 

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:26.289
 Good feeling of high rice stock 

00:02:26.289 --> 00:02:28.329
 While people are chosen 

00:02:28.329 --> 00:02:30.029
 Yen bounce 

00:02:30.029 --> 00:02:34.949
 If you get hit by anything else, the action charter soars instantly 

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:35.759
 Criticism 

00:02:35.759 --> 00:02:38.909
 I heard a story from my friend now over the American 

00:02:39.859 --> 00:02:41.439
 It decreased 

00:02:41.439 --> 00:02:44.809
 About the free king queen phenomenon 

00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:47.809
 It is a natural phenomenon that occurs when it gets undercooled 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:53.889
 I want to go under-cooling, but even if it is planned, it will back 

00:02:53.889 --> 00:02:57.510
 It becomes this state by becoming the state of 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.510
 There is an impact and freezes in an instant 

00:03:05.749 --> 00:03:08.599
 Mr. Owada hints at this phenomenon 

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:11.769
 Do you make a supercooling state and freeze at a stretch 

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:15.399
 Kakushi that water molecules are not afraid of about 70 Saito 

00:03:15.399 --> 00:03:18.399
 We started to make equipment 

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:21.579
 Is it possible to repeat trial and error? 

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:24.009
 Generate a magnetic field in the freezer 

00:03:24.009 --> 00:03:27.899
 It is a device that produces a supercooled state by shaking Shibaishi-machi kettle. 

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:32.569
 In short 

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:33.609
 Nakano 

00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:35.429
 Let's drink water 

00:03:35.429 --> 00:03:38.459
 It decreased from old fiscal year 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:41.459
 It is said that it will be released on the ball speed device 

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:47.179
 In fact, it is found freely when you answer one year 

00:03:47.179 --> 00:03:48.659
 I was not nervous 

00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:53.260
 Unlike the case of the 1 country 2 system when viewed with an electron microscope 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:57.129
 I think I was able to do it and the number to date 

00:03:57.129 --> 00:04:00.899
 Implementation that said that many improvements were made 

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:04.470
 It is something that has been around in 1997 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:09.149
 About 118% is when Susumu Taito Saito he is he 

00:04:09.149 --> 00:04:12.469
 It started from stx certification body 

00:04:12.469 --> 00:04:15.469
 Two creators remain as they are 

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:21.019
 Script writing the concept of freezing Currently used at various food sites 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:24.090
 Delivering delicious food to consumers 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:27.840
 But the same 38 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:31.460
 Aim not to be satisfied with the status quo 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:34.490
 There is 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:36.439
 Company advertisement 

00:04:36.439 --> 00:04:38.330
 Wide sea Tomodai 2 years 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:41.330
 Kobayashi Sakae Commuter 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:43.919
 It's snowing 

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:46.210
 Samantha served 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:49.590
 Now the same day is the last of several months 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:51.129
 Somehow one year 

00:04:51.129 --> 00:04:52.919
 Save a few 

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:55.659
 It can be done anytime and anywhere 

00:04:55.659 --> 00:04:58.659
 Show the year of the turning point 

00:04:59.689 --> 00:05:03.119
 Casing that can save even the result that freezing is difficult 

00:05:03.729 --> 00:05:04.939
 Mr. Ogata 

00:05:04.939 --> 00:05:07.490
 By keeping waste food for a long time 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:10.990
 Contributing to the improvement of Japan's food self-sufficiency rate 

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:12.139
 I want to do
