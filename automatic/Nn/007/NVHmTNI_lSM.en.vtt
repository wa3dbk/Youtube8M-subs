hi I'm Karla Schaffer designer for anti
speeds<00:00:02.460> and<00:00:02.760> I'm<00:00:02.850> going<00:00:03.030> to<00:00:03.120> show<00:00:03.240> you<00:00:03.330> some

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:03.510 
speeds and I'm going to show you some

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:05.180 
speeds and I'm going to show you some
different<00:00:03.629> options<00:00:03.929> on<00:00:04.350> how<00:00:04.380> to<00:00:04.529> end<00:00:04.830> memory

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:05.190 
different options on how to end memory

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:06.920 
different options on how to end memory
wire<00:00:05.370> first<00:00:06.089> thing<00:00:06.299> you<00:00:06.359> need<00:00:06.509> to<00:00:06.540> know<00:00:06.720> about

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
wire first thing you need to know about

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:08.629 
wire first thing you need to know about
memory<00:00:07.140> wire<00:00:07.410> is<00:00:07.649> that<00:00:07.680> this<00:00:07.950> is<00:00:08.130> a<00:00:08.160> tempered

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639 
memory wire is that this is a tempered

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:10.430 
memory wire is that this is a tempered
wire<00:00:08.820> and<00:00:09.000> it's<00:00:09.179> very<00:00:09.389> hard<00:00:09.660> and<00:00:09.900> you<00:00:10.019> do<00:00:10.230> not

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
wire and it's very hard and you do not

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:11.959 
wire and it's very hard and you do not
ever<00:00:10.769> want<00:00:11.070> to<00:00:11.099> cut<00:00:11.309> this<00:00:11.460> with<00:00:11.639> a<00:00:11.670> pair<00:00:11.940> of

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
ever want to cut this with a pair of

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:13.700 
ever want to cut this with a pair of
regular<00:00:12.300> nipper<00:00:12.780> tools<00:00:13.110> so<00:00:13.349> you<00:00:13.380> should

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
regular nipper tools so you should

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.709 
regular nipper tools so you should
invest<00:00:14.519> in<00:00:14.670> a<00:00:14.730> pair<00:00:14.940> of<00:00:14.969> memory<00:00:15.240> wire<00:00:15.420> shears

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
invest in a pair of memory wire shears

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.160 
invest in a pair of memory wire shears
and<00:00:16.220> memory<00:00:17.220> wire<00:00:17.369> is<00:00:17.580> coiled<00:00:18.029> and<00:00:18.539> it<00:00:18.990> does

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
and memory wire is coiled and it does

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.200 
and memory wire is coiled and it does
hold<00:00:19.410> its<00:00:19.650> shape<00:00:19.740> and<00:00:20.160> I'm<00:00:20.310> using<00:00:20.490> that<00:00:20.730> oval

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
hold its shape and I'm using that oval

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.150 
hold its shape and I'm using that oval
here<00:00:21.720> just<00:00:21.990> for<00:00:22.170> demonstration<00:00:22.680> purposes<00:00:23.100> and

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
here just for demonstration purposes and

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.950 
here just for demonstration purposes and
I<00:00:23.369> like<00:00:23.550> to<00:00:23.730> cut<00:00:23.939> the<00:00:24.060> wire<00:00:24.240> to<00:00:24.449> where<00:00:24.600> I've<00:00:24.720> got

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
I like to cut the wire to where I've got

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.189 
I like to cut the wire to where I've got
the<00:00:25.170> right<00:00:25.789> overlap<00:00:26.789> on<00:00:27.060> either<00:00:27.359> side<00:00:27.779> so<00:00:27.810> I'm

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
the right overlap on either side so I'm

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.019 
the right overlap on either side so I'm
just<00:00:28.349> gonna<00:00:28.470> trim<00:00:28.800> this<00:00:29.010> again<00:00:29.550> I'm<00:00:29.699> using<00:00:29.789> the

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
just gonna trim this again I'm using the

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.139 
just gonna trim this again I'm using the
memory<00:00:30.210> wire<00:00:30.359> shears<00:00:30.689> and<00:00:31.579> I'm<00:00:32.579> first<00:00:32.880> way<00:00:33.059> I'm

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
memory wire shears and I'm first way I'm

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.060 
memory wire shears and I'm first way I'm
going<00:00:33.329> to<00:00:33.390> show<00:00:33.540> you<00:00:33.630> how<00:00:33.809> to<00:00:34.290> end<00:00:34.500> this<00:00:34.680> is<00:00:34.890> by

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
going to show you how to end this is by

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.389 
going to show you how to end this is by
adding<00:00:35.309> a<00:00:35.520> loop<00:00:35.880> to<00:00:36.270> the<00:00:36.390> end<00:00:36.630> and<00:00:37.469> you<00:00:38.129> can<00:00:38.250> do

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
adding a loop to the end and you can do

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.010 
adding a loop to the end and you can do
it<00:00:38.460> with<00:00:38.550> a<00:00:38.579> round<00:00:38.790> nose<00:00:39.000> pliers<00:00:39.360> or<00:00:39.750> you<00:00:39.899> can

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
it with a round nose pliers or you can

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.200 
it with a round nose pliers or you can
do<00:00:40.140> it<00:00:40.230> with<00:00:40.350> the<00:00:41.100> wire<00:00:42.059> looping<00:00:42.390> pliers

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:44.210 
do it with the wire looping pliers

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:50.180 
do it with the wire looping pliers
position<00:00:45.210> them<00:00:47.899> and<00:00:48.899> it's<00:00:49.110> very<00:00:49.559> hard<00:00:49.920> so<00:00:50.129> you

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
position them and it's very hard so you

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:58.700 
position them and it's very hard so you
want<00:00:50.399> to<00:00:50.460> grab<00:00:51.090> a<00:00:51.210> hold<00:00:51.510> of<00:00:51.600> your<00:00:51.660> wire

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.450 

and<00:00:59.280> I'm<00:01:00.060> just<00:01:00.210> gonna<00:01:00.330> grasp<00:01:00.690> it<00:01:01.130> and<00:01:02.130> roll<00:01:02.430> it

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
and I'm just gonna grasp it and roll it

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:03.530 
and I'm just gonna grasp it and roll it
away<00:01:02.910> from<00:01:03.150> me

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:03.540 
away from me

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:06.050 
away from me
and<00:01:03.810> I<00:01:03.930> said<00:01:04.199> it<00:01:04.290> is<00:01:04.410> a<00:01:04.530> very<00:01:04.830> tough<00:01:05.100> wire<00:01:05.850> to

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
and I said it is a very tough wire to

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.300 
and I said it is a very tough wire to
work<00:01:06.210> with<00:01:06.390> and<00:01:06.930> when<00:01:07.140> you<00:01:07.230> have<00:01:07.470> beads<00:01:07.920> on

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
work with and when you have beads on

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.430 
work with and when you have beads on
here<00:01:08.640> on<00:01:08.760> your<00:01:08.880> other<00:01:09.090> end<00:01:09.420> does<00:01:10.020> make<00:01:10.260> it<00:01:10.380> a

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:10.440 
here on your other end does make it a

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:12.230 
here on your other end does make it a
little<00:01:10.620> more<00:01:10.860> difficult<00:01:11.070> to<00:01:11.460> end<00:01:11.700> this<00:01:11.940> but

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
little more difficult to end this but

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.210 
little more difficult to end this but
you<00:01:12.360> just<00:01:12.390> need<00:01:12.660> to<00:01:12.780> have<00:01:12.930> to<00:01:13.080> grab<00:01:13.800> a<00:01:13.830> hold<00:01:14.070> and

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
you just need to have to grab a hold and

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.700 
you just need to have to grab a hold and
what<00:01:14.700> I<00:01:14.760> like<00:01:15.060> to<00:01:15.210> do<00:01:15.330> is<00:01:16.020> get<00:01:16.350> it<00:01:16.440> to<00:01:16.470> where<00:01:16.680> I

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
what I like to do is get it to where I

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.800 
what I like to do is get it to where I
have<00:01:16.890> a<00:01:16.920> little<00:01:17.190> bit<00:01:17.400> of<00:01:17.520> an<00:01:17.610> overlap<00:01:18.180> on<00:01:18.750> the

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
have a little bit of an overlap on the

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.080 
have a little bit of an overlap on the
wire<00:01:19.560> almost<00:01:20.160> like<00:01:20.310> a<00:01:20.340> split<00:01:20.670> ring<00:01:20.850> but<00:01:21.060> not

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
wire almost like a split ring but not

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.010 
wire almost like a split ring but not
quite<00:01:21.420> that<00:01:21.570> far

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
quite that far

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.230 
quite that far
okay<00:01:22.770> I've<00:01:22.860> got<00:01:22.890> one<00:01:23.100> loop<00:01:23.610> and<00:01:23.790> this<00:01:23.880> was<00:01:24.060> just

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
okay I've got one loop and this was just

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.450 
okay I've got one loop and this was just
using<00:01:24.510> the<00:01:24.600> round<00:01:24.780> nose<00:01:24.930> pliers<00:01:25.290> and<00:01:25.650> then<00:01:25.770> you

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
using the round nose pliers and then you

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:27.859 
using the round nose pliers and then you
can<00:01:26.610> hang<00:01:26.820> the<00:01:26.970> angles<00:01:27.270> or<00:01:27.510> whatever<00:01:27.750> from

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
can hang the angles or whatever from

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.630 
can hang the angles or whatever from
this<00:01:28.080> loop<00:01:28.229> because<00:01:28.440> it<00:01:28.560> is<00:01:28.680> somewhat<00:01:29.280> closed

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
this loop because it is somewhat closed

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.430 
this loop because it is somewhat closed
now<00:01:30.450> on<00:01:30.540> the<00:01:30.630> other<00:01:30.750> end<00:01:30.869> I'll<00:01:31.110> show<00:01:31.140> you<00:01:31.320> how

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:31.440 
now on the other end I'll show you how

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.109 
now on the other end I'll show you how
to<00:01:31.500> do<00:01:31.649> it<00:01:31.740> with<00:01:31.860> the<00:01:32.040> wire<00:01:32.580> looping<00:01:32.910> tool

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
to do it with the wire looping tool

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.359 
to do it with the wire looping tool
again<00:01:34.050> it's<00:01:34.200> much<00:01:34.410> the<00:01:34.590> same<00:01:34.740> way<00:01:34.920> as<00:01:35.070> making<00:01:35.250> a

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
again it's much the same way as making a

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.550 
again it's much the same way as making a
rosary<00:01:35.580> loop<00:01:35.940> again<00:01:36.869> grab<00:01:37.200> ahold<00:01:37.350> of<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:37.649> wire

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.560 
rosary loop again grab ahold of the wire

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.469 
rosary loop again grab ahold of the wire
take<00:01:40.560> it<00:01:40.649> around<00:01:40.770> the<00:01:41.220> wire<00:01:42.060> looping<00:01:42.420> pliers

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
take it around the wire looping pliers

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:49.609 
take it around the wire looping pliers
put<00:01:44.390> in<00:01:45.390> the<00:01:45.750> tool<00:01:47.330> jaw<00:01:48.330> go<00:01:49.110> in<00:01:49.229> and<00:01:49.380> bring<00:01:49.500> it

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
put in the tool jaw go in and bring it

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:53.660 
put in the tool jaw go in and bring it
so<00:01:49.800> you<00:01:49.890> can<00:01:50.070> see<00:01:50.399> close<00:01:51.270> to<00:01:51.479> the<00:01:51.570> end<00:01:52.670> clamp

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
so you can see close to the end clamp

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.290 
so you can see close to the end clamp
down<00:01:53.910> on<00:01:53.970> it<00:01:54.240> and<00:01:54.690> again<00:01:55.290> roll<00:01:55.560> away<00:01:56.300> or
