00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:14.750 

I<00:00:12.110> think<00:00:13.110> there's<00:00:13.260> a<00:00:13.320> lot<00:00:13.530> of<00:00:13.710> nonverbal<00:00:14.640> and

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:14.760 
I think there's a lot of nonverbal and

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:16.700 
I think there's a lot of nonverbal and
verbal<00:00:14.880> cues<00:00:15.480> that<00:00:15.510> the<00:00:15.780> preceptor<00:00:16.290> can<00:00:16.500> give

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
verbal cues that the preceptor can give

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.440 
verbal cues that the preceptor can give
the<00:00:16.890> orientate<00:00:17.310> and<00:00:17.610> a<00:00:17.790> lot<00:00:17.970> of<00:00:18.000> the<00:00:18.180> things

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:18.450 
the orientate and a lot of the things

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:19.730 
the orientate and a lot of the things
that<00:00:18.660> we<00:00:18.779> talked<00:00:18.960> about<00:00:19.200> about<00:00:19.380> trying<00:00:19.650> to

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
that we talked about about trying to

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.800 
that we talked about about trying to
discern<00:00:20.070> what<00:00:20.700> someone's<00:00:21.060> motives<00:00:21.450> are<00:00:21.660> if

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
discern what someone's motives are if

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.690 
discern what someone's motives are if
they're<00:00:21.960> truly<00:00:22.200> trying<00:00:22.440> to<00:00:22.560> help<00:00:22.770> you<00:00:23.040> push

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:23.700 
they're truly trying to help you push

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:25.700 
they're truly trying to help you push
you<00:00:23.910> into<00:00:24.119> an<00:00:24.330> uncomfortable<00:00:24.840> situation<00:00:25.680> for

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
you into an uncomfortable situation for

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.370 
you into an uncomfortable situation for
your<00:00:26.040> own<00:00:26.189> benefit<00:00:26.820> versus<00:00:27.750> pushing<00:00:28.140> you<00:00:28.230> into

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
your own benefit versus pushing you into

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.710 
your own benefit versus pushing you into
that<00:00:28.560> situation<00:00:29.279> because<00:00:30.090> they<00:00:30.300> could<00:00:30.509> care

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
that situation because they could care

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.030 
that situation because they could care
less<00:00:30.750> and<00:00:31.200> they<00:00:31.290> just<00:00:31.470> want<00:00:31.650> you<00:00:31.710> off<00:00:31.860> their

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
less and they just want you off their

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:32.569 
less and they just want you off their
hands

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
hands

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.930 
hands
and<00:00:32.730> I<00:00:33.450> think<00:00:33.710> nonverbal<00:00:34.710> can<00:00:35.100> sometimes<00:00:35.520> make

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
and I think nonverbal can sometimes make

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.900 
and I think nonverbal can sometimes make
the<00:00:35.970> difference<00:00:36.510> I<00:00:37.460> would<00:00:38.460> hope<00:00:38.670> that<00:00:38.700> a

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
the difference I would hope that a

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.040 
the difference I would hope that a
preceptor<00:00:39.540> would<00:00:39.690> never<00:00:39.930> pass<00:00:40.800> in<00:00:41.130> sky<00:00:41.370> or

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:42.050 
preceptor would never pass in sky or

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:46.310 
preceptor would never pass in sky or
show<00:00:43.050> other<00:00:43.350> even<00:00:44.160> nonverbal<00:00:44.910> cues<00:00:45.780> of<00:00:46.109> I

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
show other even nonverbal cues of I

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.349 
show other even nonverbal cues of I
don't<00:00:46.379> want<00:00:46.590> to<00:00:46.770> be<00:00:46.920> with<00:00:47.100> you<00:00:47.219> today<00:00:47.430> and<00:00:47.760> this

00:00:48.349 --> 00:00:48.359 
don't want to be with you today and this

00:00:48.359 --> 00:00:51.290 
don't want to be with you today and this
can<00:00:48.570> happen<00:00:49.010> whether<00:00:50.010> they<00:00:50.309> just<00:00:50.699> see<00:00:51.180> you

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
can happen whether they just see you

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.790 
can happen whether they just see you
coming<00:00:51.600> in<00:00:51.719> and<00:00:51.750> you<00:00:51.960> can<00:00:52.109> tell<00:00:52.230> by<00:00:52.379> their<00:00:52.530> face

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
coming in and you can tell by their face

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.680 
coming in and you can tell by their face
I<00:00:53.070> think<00:00:53.160> it<00:00:53.489> can<00:00:53.640> affect<00:00:53.969> the<00:00:54.120> dynamics<00:00:54.600> of

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
I think it can affect the dynamics of

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.709 
I think it can affect the dynamics of
the<00:00:54.840> unit<00:00:55.199> to<00:00:55.800> have<00:00:56.010> someone<00:00:56.550> who<00:00:56.730> even<00:00:57.420> if<00:00:57.660> you

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
the unit to have someone who even if you

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.060 
the unit to have someone who even if you
have<00:00:57.870> someone<00:00:58.109> who<00:00:58.230> hates<00:00:58.379> their<00:00:58.559> job<00:00:58.620> period

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
have someone who hates their job period

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.610 
have someone who hates their job period
when<00:00:59.489> they<00:00:59.609> come<00:00:59.789> in<00:00:59.969> they<00:01:00.179> bring<00:01:00.359> you<00:01:00.510> down<00:01:00.690> so

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
when they come in they bring you down so

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.470 
when they come in they bring you down so
to<00:01:01.710> have<00:01:01.859> someone<00:01:02.190> who<00:01:02.280> hates<00:01:02.519> precepting<00:01:03.269> and

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
to have someone who hates precepting and

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.150 
to have someone who hates precepting and
then<00:01:03.899> to<00:01:04.019> have<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.230> or<00:01:04.350> ent<00:01:04.739> there<00:01:04.980> it's

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:05.160 
then to have the or ent there it's

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:09.740 
then to have the or ent there it's
really<00:01:05.489> awkward

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.510 

sometimes<00:01:10.560> it<00:01:10.800> might<00:01:10.920> be<00:01:11.070> because<00:01:11.250> they<00:01:11.460> were

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
sometimes it might be because they were

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.760 
sometimes it might be because they were
pushed<00:01:11.820> into<00:01:12.030> it<00:01:12.330> or<00:01:12.600> they<00:01:12.780> felt<00:01:12.990> obligated<00:01:13.170> to

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
pushed into it or they felt obligated to

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.250 
pushed into it or they felt obligated to
do<00:01:13.890> it<00:01:14.100> and<00:01:14.370> sometimes<00:01:15.360> it<00:01:15.780> might<00:01:15.930> be<00:01:15.990> because

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:16.260 
do it and sometimes it might be because

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:17.510 
do it and sometimes it might be because
they've<00:01:16.560> been<00:01:16.770> doing<00:01:16.980> it<00:01:17.160> for<00:01:17.190> too<00:01:17.490> long

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
they've been doing it for too long

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.510 
they've been doing it for too long
without<00:01:18.060> a<00:01:18.120> break<00:01:18.210> and<00:01:18.720> they're<00:01:18.900> burnt<00:01:19.110> out

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.520 
without a break and they're burnt out

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.300 
without a break and they're burnt out
but<00:01:20.520> on<00:01:20.820> either<00:01:21.630> circumstance<00:01:22.410> they<00:01:22.980> deserve

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
but on either circumstance they deserve

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.610 
but on either circumstance they deserve
a<00:01:23.340> break<00:01:23.700> or<00:01:24.390> maybe<00:01:24.630> they<00:01:24.900> just<00:01:24.930> maybe

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:25.620 
a break or maybe they just maybe

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:27.590 
a break or maybe they just maybe
precepting<00:01:26.190> isn't<00:01:26.460> their<00:01:26.610> thing<00:01:26.850> but<00:01:27.330> I<00:01:27.390> would

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
precepting isn't their thing but I would

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.120 
precepting isn't their thing but I would
hope<00:01:27.750> that<00:01:27.780> management<00:01:28.230> would<00:01:28.500> support<00:01:28.950> that

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
hope that management would support that

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.520 
hope that management would support that
decision<00:01:29.360> to<00:01:30.360> not<00:01:30.390> have<00:01:30.840> them<00:01:31.050> precept

ting with an attitude of I hate this as

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.260 
ting with an attitude of I hate this as
a<00:01:37.620> preceptor<00:01:38.250> you<00:01:38.580> would<00:01:38.700> even<00:01:38.940> tell<00:01:39.090> your

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
a preceptor you would even tell your

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.730 
a preceptor you would even tell your
manager<00:01:39.510> you<00:01:39.870> know<00:01:40.140> what<00:01:40.260> I<00:01:40.290> would<00:01:40.500> like<00:01:40.650> to

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
manager you know what I would like to

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.350 
manager you know what I would like to
take<00:01:40.830> a<00:01:40.860> break<00:01:41.100> for<00:01:41.310> a<00:01:41.370> while<00:01:41.460> I'm<00:01:42.119> getting

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
overwhelmed myself so it's really hard

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.120 
overwhelmed myself so it's really hard
