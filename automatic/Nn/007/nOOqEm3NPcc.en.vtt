00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.879
 zero okay we learn to do 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.620
 a mass that I love always make a 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:09.570
 alternative for you to escape from that 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.300
 more conventional pasta with sauce 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:15.089
 Tomato we learn how to make skin 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.670
 limone is not just a mass with 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.859
 lemon sauce but that Martian knows 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.820
 that more yellow phase more difficult 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.039
 to find 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:27.650
 for many wonder recipe is very 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.650
 nice without learning well 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:41.010
 luddy that now if you're gonna make a 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:44.309
 pasta is cool to cook he has with 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.170
 plenty of hot water with ossuary polio 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.730
 asked if I was going to look, I guess 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.530
 cool put look i think it's mean 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.620
 what a myth why if you put oil 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.629
 oil is on the pasta and a sauce 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.809
 there will not be so much in it then the 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:59.640
 Secret is right here with me Osvaldo places 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.250
 very hot water only after you 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.500
 put the pasta and I put salt in it 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:08.490
 water and if you do it that way he will not 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:12.240
 will save water in brazil 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:17.580
 while the table only put in the seat here 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:20.800
 It 's difficult in my pan. 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:23.290
 it is little to say that we will strengthen the 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:26.020
 be ball remembered than the ingredients 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:28.690
 are in the video description if you 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:31.810
 I can do it against rafa, I'm not 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:33.340
 very fan of these pasta 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:35.080
 I'm very fan of these type pasta 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:37.180
 spaghetti noodles in which you have to 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:38.680
 so get naked spin you like 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:40.840
 paulo ae 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:42.190
 until ours appears so I can forget 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.990
 that mass is not 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:45.580
 I like very pleasantly to give a 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:48.160
 bottle and already put our hand in our 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:50.230
 business sticking is more practical and 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:51.670
 do not look that you understand here a little 

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:56.680
 olive oil 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:58.810
 I 'll make it good, I'll give a lawyer. 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:01.390
 agent this recipe is very easy and well 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:03.250
 That little dance for you to make pasta 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:05.650
 already a wildcard at the time you're not afraid 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:08.470
 that you go there and make a canon you 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:11.729
 I want to give a varied face to face 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:11.729
 very tasty 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:22.810
 give a peek that used to promise 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:31.120
 Brazilian of us 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:37.570
 she comes to a sweaty here just look at this 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:43.510
 boot softer than their last century 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:45.790
 new talking routes was today that it is 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:47.890
 with the detailed flag it 's true 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:52.170
 look at paying this program so well 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:52.170
 what he is doing does not make it to helen 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:57.430
 more a stew here in our onion 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:01.269
 Look how the magic of our 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:05.019
 pasta is already cooked it runs it 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:06.610
 stay al dente just before the 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:07.290
 al dente because we're going to 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:10.670
 play 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:10.670
 and then he's going to give a little twist 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:22.290
 site 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:24.810
 then you already put salt yet 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:34.019
 had put in the water is a dog says 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:36.870
 in the sun is a very mouth of this pepper 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:41.939
 We'll use pink pepper. 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:46.220
 That tonight is going to give a little flower a 

00:03:41.939 --> 00:03:46.220
 flavor also shows very fragrant 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:59.159
 there you see in a coup 

00:03:51.629 --> 00:04:00.810
 I do not even know what I'm getting 

00:03:59.159 --> 00:04:03.620
 talk about it in a bag 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:03.620
 full of water 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:11.599
 there he was silent because I did not 

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:11.599
 At the beginning, I'm only going to fight until today. 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:25.560
 I will look to smell around loose the 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:30.990
 moors and xororó is already good there is that if 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:33.770
 off and puts a large milk when 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:38.070
 and if it's cool people in recipes 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:40.650
 salty hot like these have to 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:41.669
 turn off the fire be sour cream 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:46.320
 fresh 

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:50.780
 lemon juice and look that gives a taste 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:50.780
 Also very good are the raspberries gusmán 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:55.729
 Very well and mix everything here. 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:08.300
 ai as this has already herein is bad 

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:08.300
 she ends up more curious, huh? 

00:05:13.789 --> 00:05:23.640
 let's try now Brazil will also have 

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:25.500
 now that the good and beautiful part make a 

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:27.180
 Presentation I choose a dish more 

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:30.570
 background that I found here in the Bahia house 

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:33.030
 ction and I will try to put right in the center 

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:35.700
 not to soil his boots when going 

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:39.030
 to treat the virgin cooking program 

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:41.520
 he always book covers dirty 'grandson 

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:42.990
 trying to put it well that puts a lot 

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:46.590
 food because otherwise it will look 

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:49.289
 School lunch is beautiful. 

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:50.800
 the masses of dry air also 

00:05:49.289 --> 00:05:55.090
 It is that it is the culprit 

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:58.419
 look a little more at a goal 

00:05:55.090 --> 00:06:01.270
 that trick does not give you a spread and 

00:05:58.419 --> 00:06:04.240
 Pasta orders parmesan cheese for free with 

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:06.789
 Pretty cheese pablo, let's put it 

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:09.310
 enough cheese for the dick it's ok 

00:06:06.789 --> 00:06:11.139
 yellow here, there's not much contrast 

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:12.789
 food has to have an evaluation of 

00:06:11.139 --> 00:06:18.639
 body that does not look like a thing 

00:06:12.789 --> 00:06:21.580
 Only now it's going to take so I'm going to put 

00:06:18.639 --> 00:06:23.919
 pink pepper that looks that beautiful thing 

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:26.710
 that she comes these balls here I go 

00:06:23.919 --> 00:06:28.449
 to play some peppers here just to be 

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:31.479
 like a ball on this fifth coach 

00:06:28.449 --> 00:06:33.669
 Do not have to know that I've already taken a palette. 

00:06:31.479 --> 00:06:35.110
 of mango with pink pepper is very 

00:06:33.669 --> 00:06:37.719
 tasty 

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:40.449
 She is very strong, she is not beautiful and stayed 

00:06:37.719 --> 00:06:42.370
 to give a very beautiful color, right? 

00:06:40.449 --> 00:06:44.759
 This is it, Brazil, ours is ready. 

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:44.759
 dish 

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:56.590
 Do you know if you like to dance? 

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:58.870
 short video with part of facebook too 

00:06:56.590 --> 00:07:01.300
 Do you speak facebook now has a page in the 

00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:03.520
 facebook facebook has placed a boat on 

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:05.470
 kitchen does not cut has enough thing 

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:13.000
 cool for not getting a prescription 

00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:15.670
 Open type magic from Brazil is very good 

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:19.290
 to mark our tenth can not be 

00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:19.290
 large stadium and kitchen 

00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:35.250
 some things even when Brazil
