00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:03.389 
I came to Malaysia to do my undergrad

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:06.499 
I came to Malaysia to do my undergrad
and<00:00:03.890> I<00:00:04.890> did<00:00:05.040> my<00:00:05.160> undergrad<00:00:05.640> in<00:00:05.819> graphic<00:00:06.180> design

00:00:06.499 --> 00:00:06.509

and I did my undergrad in graphic design
and<00:00:07.639> after<00:00:08.639> doing<00:00:08.910> graphic<00:00:09.300> design<00:00:09.330> um<00:00:09.929> I

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
and after doing graphic design um I

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.520 
and after doing graphic design um I
decided<00:00:10.469> I<00:00:11.010> would<00:00:11.219> rather<00:00:11.460> be<00:00:11.670> a<00:00:12.300> manager<00:00:13.019> of

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
decided I would rather be a manager of

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.430 
decided I would rather be a manager of
the<00:00:13.860> design<00:00:14.190> rather<00:00:15.150> than<00:00:15.330> a<00:00:15.509> designer<00:00:15.960> itself

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
the design rather than a designer itself

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.529 
the design rather than a designer itself
so<00:00:16.890> I'd<00:00:17.220> rather<00:00:17.340> get<00:00:17.580> into<00:00:17.820> marketing<00:00:18.300> and

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
communication the main reason is to get

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.140 
communication the main reason is to get
some<00:00:21.990> kind<00:00:22.199> of<00:00:22.320> a<00:00:22.410> business<00:00:22.650> sense<00:00:23.070> because<00:00:23.850> my

Cullum<00:04:28.140> or<00:04:28.320> local<00:04:28.770> university<00:04:29.340> coming<00:04:30.060> into

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:30.270 
Cullum or local university coming into

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:31.940 
Cullum or local university coming into
an<00:04:30.390> international<00:04:31.050> thing<00:04:31.290> it's<00:04:31.440> sometimes

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:31.950 
an international thing it's sometimes

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:33.770 
an international thing it's sometimes
you<00:04:32.430> are<00:04:32.580> stepping<00:04:32.850> into<00:04:33.030> a<00:04:33.150> new<00:04:33.300> world

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:33.780 
you are stepping into a new world

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:35.240 
you are stepping into a new world
so<00:04:33.990> without<00:04:34.230> proper<00:04:34.500> guidance<00:04:34.740> I<00:04:35.070> think

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:35.250 
so without proper guidance I think

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:37.580 
so without proper guidance I think
someone<00:04:35.520> can<00:04:35.700> get<00:04:35.880> lost<00:04:36.090> easily<00:04:36.360> and<00:04:37.050> I<00:04:37.170> quote

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:37.590 
someone can get lost easily and I quote

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:40.130 
someone can get lost easily and I quote
what<00:04:38.100> times<00:04:38.400> free<00:04:38.610> has<00:04:38.760> said<00:04:39.000> about<00:04:39.150> the<00:04:39.870> East

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:40.140 
what times free has said about the East

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:42.980 
what times free has said about the East
and<00:04:40.410> West<00:04:40.620> being<00:04:41.010> in<00:04:41.280> one<00:04:42.000> coin<00:04:42.360> so<00:04:42.870> I<00:04:42.930> think

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:42.990 
and West being in one coin so I think

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:45.020 
and West being in one coin so I think
that<00:04:43.230> really<00:04:43.920> applies<00:04:44.220> in<00:04:44.430> this<00:04:44.520> university

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:45.030 
that really applies in this university

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:49.070 
that really applies in this university
