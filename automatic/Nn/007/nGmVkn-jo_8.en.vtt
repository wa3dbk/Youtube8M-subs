 Definitely die by freaks 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.540
 at least that's the plan 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:10.670
 and then the chat shows how 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.670
 many hearts of the freaks still had 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.619

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:41.320
 here on the gomez server and that is 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:43.960
 it now so that you can plug in or in the sg 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:45.850
 at sg always gets displayed how much 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:48.129
 the opponent still had when I say 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:49.780
 I'll die at the end of the day 

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:51.640
 round in any case by freaks 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:54.760
 At least the plan will die 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:58.410
 and then the chip will show how 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:01:00.309
 many hearts of the freaks still had and 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.930
 I would say that 

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:06.009
 let's try something here to tear you 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:13.539
 are two places next to Klose 

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:22.149
 business yes okay still travel sword 

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:26.679
 I do not have any okay behind here 

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:31.179
 Not at all here, not necessarily 

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:34.060
 are more expensive and here is one 

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:36.009
 ancient new star I need you 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.780
 yes I am not dead but excluded 

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:40.959
 be such an after the hole I get 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:43.770
 before somebody else does that, so yes 

00:01:40.959 --> 00:01:46.420
 already carries actions beginning 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:49.450
 I got him, both the new ones now 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:50.979
 now from the age okay that was already one 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:52.090
 little action to start this is coming 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:53.259
 one more now let us first briefly 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:02:01.239
 walk away because tracks probably 

00:01:53.259 --> 00:02:02.890
 just okay then come first with pass 

00:02:01.239 --> 00:02:07.560
 there's another on the back 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:07.560
 yes ok rappaz passepartout 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:13.510
 it was just easy once 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:16.750
 more precisely which could now 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:21.370
 left to left and left to left 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:23.230
 right here, age, what is going on people? 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.890
 the brave fast shoot like that 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.500
 expected 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:32.680
 With that he comes again, it comes to me 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:35.470
 I had to hate it so it's up 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:38.910
 Anyway, I think my okay 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:38.910
 kill me today I have no problem 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:57.760
 we always need to stop 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:00.130
 inside there is so much feeling right 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:08.050
 he holds an electrically the area yes 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:11.880
 I see is straight from the ancient Greek 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:14.530
 taken mentioned okay what we need 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:18.160

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:20.080
 Oh yes, yes , but this better and better 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.250
 I mean, there's two of them in the back 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:23.850
 know now but just not know if that one 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:23.850
 team is 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:28.720
 I would say that after the races 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:31.260
 bring exactly and let us on the 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:34.510
 go burning 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:38.050
 There we find and whole teams take 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:39.550
 we are taking everything we need 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:41.620
 the behind us, yes, exactly the mean 

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:44.380
 But a thick blanket burschen in it 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:47.370

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:52.900
 but I do not have arrows at a fast pace 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:55.390
 no matter now comes with combinatorial map careful 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:58.049
 there comes a yes where did you want to go 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:04:00.010

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:08.320

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:24.550
 God 

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:26.830

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:27.790
 awo kita children who ob jungs behind us 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:33.760
 in the argument 

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:35.530
 I peeked I got five titles 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:37.770
 yes what I'm running after that ok I have to 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:42.360
 I really had to grab him 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:45.160
 try to cough does not care 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:47.139
 he should not run the one to the 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:49.270
 There, the city of Passau was installed 

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:50.590
 pfizer okay today still come so 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:54.400
 of which is now probably really 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:05:07.180
 one hundred percent ours it is not there 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:05:08.650
 No older than half a horse yes 

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:12.360
 No matter I would say I 'll do the rounds 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:12.360

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:20.500
 so I will definitely again 

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:22.360
 maybe a fool or something 

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:23.139
 So you go to it before you go in 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:26.080
 make screenshot 

00:05:23.139 --> 00:05:27.370
 just so that can see the whole 

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:29.620
 one can recognize for the reason because 

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:31.630
 this plug-in shows how many hearts 

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:36.010
 the opponent still had is definitely 

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:37.360
 cool made so the freaks I wanted 

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:41.050

 this list is the last one 

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:51.840
 I do not have a lot of heart 

00:05:52.320 --> 00:06:00.460
 from the recently is not as secure safe 

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:02.160
 so and the colleague would like me, of course 

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:07.660
 like to drop in lava that is however 

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:10.380
 sometimes a colleague please stand still 

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:10.380
 the composting 

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:16.850
 I would even say it go 

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:19.220
 again very briefly in the round war 

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:21.200
 as well as games then I show you how that 

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:22.880
 whole so is uncut i would say we 

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:25.190
 Just go here quite well over 9/11 

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:28.040
 I'll just kill myself then 

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:29.330
 I leave that more or less like that 

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:32.350
 how are simply times running it here 

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:38.630
 one that's making us that our technology 

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:41.570
 everything all up and quickly so all 

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:45.400
 and then are still killing on new town 

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:48.290
 and fast 

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:51.430
 Ok, I'll come see 

00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:53.630
 the issue here because I wait never directly 

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:54.920
 okay i think i am almost too 

00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:56.990
 well i'm okay comes the first with that 

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:57.680
 swears at mac envelopes with the sword 

00:06:56.990 --> 00:07:00.260
 perfect 

00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:01.970
 so now we see how fast 

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:03.230
 that can go so had more 

00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:04.760
 eight hearts, which of course not now 

00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:07.400
 amazing is I had no sword 

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:09.320
 recognized from behind alba dying because of 

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:10.610
 So eight heart still called and that 

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:12.740
 is now also displayed here in the 

00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:15.230
 Cam I find cool made the go 

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:16.790
 very normal and that was on everyone 

00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:18.560
 I also want a really cool one 

00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:20.360
 Round was definitely funny the 

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:26.930
 first round was a lot of action 

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:28.250
 they say okay at this point 

00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:29.210
 I wanted to say that 's it from the video 

00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:30.590
 Of course I hope you have it now 

00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:32.210
 fallen and maybe you still 

00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:34.220
 want to see more do you think 

00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:37.220
 old hat was cool and I want money 

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:38.480
 so do not be traumatized 

00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:39.680
 then you can like my freaks 

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:42.400
 drop by because we have a round 

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:42.400
 something recorded 

00:07:44.350 --> 00:07:47.630
 then you are welcome at the freaks 

00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:49.460
 drop by for a round something 

00:07:47.630 --> 00:07:50.780
 and in that sense would 

00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:53.920
 I say let's lean for the coal 

00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:53.920
 Round and see you next time bye
