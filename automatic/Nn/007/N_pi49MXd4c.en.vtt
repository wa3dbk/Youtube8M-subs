dust<00:00:42.540> cloud<00:00:42.840> and<00:00:43.530> what<00:00:43.649> we're<00:00:43.800> doing<00:00:43.829> is<00:00:44.100> we've

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
dust cloud and what we're doing is we've

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.890 
dust cloud and what we're doing is we've
got<00:00:44.280> a<00:00:44.430> light<00:00:45.059> carronade<00:00:45.600> on<00:00:45.750> the<00:00:45.840> front<00:00:46.079> cover

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:48.900 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:55.370 

and<00:00:48.990> a<00:00:49.650> flamer<00:00:50.010> on<00:00:50.460> the<00:00:50.580> side

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:55.380 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:57.740 

the<00:00:55.890> light<00:00:56.340> carronade<00:00:56.820> is<00:00:57.000> excellent<00:00:57.690> for

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
the light carronade is excellent for

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.320 
the light carronade is excellent for
taking<00:00:58.200> down<00:00:58.380> balloons<00:00:58.770> and<00:00:59.120> so<00:01:00.120> is<00:01:00.180> the

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:00.330 
taking down balloons and so is the

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:02.660 
taking down balloons and so is the
flamethrower<00:01:00.810> if<00:01:01.020> you<00:01:01.320> get<00:01:01.560> a<00:01:01.590> few<00:01:01.860> stacks<00:01:02.340> of

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
flamethrower if you get a few stacks of

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:09.250 
flamethrower if you get a few stacks of
plane<00:01:02.970> on<00:01:03.810> the<00:01:04.370> enemies<00:01:05.370> below<00:01:06.110> like<00:01:07.110> that

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:09.260 
plane on the enemies below like that

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:13.550 
plane on the enemies below like that
they<00:01:10.260> go<00:01:10.440> down<00:01:10.620> really<00:01:11.220> quite<00:01:11.460> fast<00:01:11.790> as<00:01:12.560> you

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
they go down really quite fast as you

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.160 
they go down really quite fast as you
can<00:01:13.680> see<00:01:13.890> that<00:01:13.920> whole<00:01:14.610> armor<00:01:14.940> is<00:01:15.000> down<00:01:15.270> up<00:01:15.840> top

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
can see that whole armor is down up top

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.860 
can see that whole armor is down up top
lift<00:01:16.500> and<00:01:16.800> also<00:01:17.400> different<00:01:17.700> lumen<00:01:17.880> is<00:01:17.940> down<00:01:18.180> so

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:18.870 
lift and also different lumen is down so

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:20.300 
lift and also different lumen is down so
there's<00:01:19.080> thinking<00:01:19.470> towards<00:01:19.770> the<00:01:19.860> ground<00:01:20.010> I'm

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
there's thinking towards the ground I'm

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.210 
there's thinking towards the ground I'm
just<00:01:20.460> going<00:01:20.640> to<00:01:20.700> force<00:01:20.940> them<00:01:21.180> down<00:01:21.360> I'm

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:22.220

00:06:59.939 --> 00:06:59.949 
there I was playing with the front and

00:06:59.949 --> 00:07:04.920 
there I was playing with the front and
the<00:07:00.009> back<00:07:00.069> is<00:07:00.520> a<00:07:00.729> very<00:07:01.629> necessary<00:07:02.139> thing<00:07:03.930> being

00:07:08.969 --> 00:07:08.979 
a pilot is using your reverse using all

00:07:08.979 --> 00:07:11.339 
a pilot is using your reverse using all
speeds<00:07:09.340> so<00:07:09.879> I'm<00:07:10.150> doing<00:07:10.599> full<00:07:10.810> reverse<00:07:11.080> they're

00:07:11.339 --> 00:07:11.349 
speeds so I'm doing full reverse they're

00:07:11.349 --> 00:07:13.379 
speeds so I'm doing full reverse they're
just<00:07:11.620> getting<00:07:11.889> all<00:07:12.370> the<00:07:12.400> speed<00:07:12.729> i<00:07:12.759> can<00:07:13.090> in<00:07:13.330> the

00:07:13.379 --> 00:07:13.389 
just getting all the speed i can in the

00:07:13.389 --> 00:07:17.089 
just getting all the speed i can in the
turn<00:07:13.629> turn<00:07:14.229> faster<00:07:14.770> if<00:07:14.860> you'll<00:07:15.150> moving<00:07:16.150> slowly

00:07:17.089 --> 00:07:17.099 
turn turn faster if you'll moving slowly

00:07:17.099 --> 00:07:23.309 
turn turn faster if you'll moving slowly
so<00:07:20.819> okay<00:07:21.819> so<00:07:21.940> i'm<00:07:22.270> creeping<00:07:22.690> up<00:07:22.810> on<00:07:22.900> them<00:07:23.050> full

00:07:23.309 --> 00:07:23.319 
so okay so i'm creeping up on them full

00:07:23.319 --> 00:07:25.670 
so okay so i'm creeping up on them full
reverse<00:07:23.590> just<00:07:23.889> to<00:07:24.009> stop<00:07:24.370> hold<00:07:24.699> that<00:07:24.940> angle<00:07:25.389> and

00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:25.680 
reverse just to stop hold that angle and

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:29.890 
reverse just to stop hold that angle and
then<00:07:26.680> a<00:07:26.979> couple<00:07:27.729> of<00:07:27.940> points<00:07:28.240> into

00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:29.900 
then a couple of points into

00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:41.050 
then a couple of points into
just<00:07:30.050> that<00:07:30.889> slow<00:07:31.330> and<00:07:32.330> down<00:07:33.110> he<00:07:33.380> goes<00:07:40.060> keeping

00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:41.060 
just that slow and down he goes keeping

00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:52.530 
just that slow and down he goes keeping
that<00:07:41.090> honor<00:07:41.930> even<00:07:42.440> when<00:07:42.800> he's<00:07:42.919> down

00:07:52.530 --> 00:07:52.540 

00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:56.920 

the<00:07:53.540> bottom<00:07:53.900> and<00:07:54.110> down<00:07:54.380> he<00:07:54.560> goes<00:07:54.770> and<00:07:55.150> that<00:07:56.150> is

00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:56.930 
the bottom and down he goes and that is

00:07:56.930 --> 00:08:01.389 
the bottom and down he goes and that is
how<00:07:57.260> to<00:07:57.320> do<00:07:57.650> a<00:07:57.919> balloon<00:07:58.669> popping<00:07:59.090> squid
