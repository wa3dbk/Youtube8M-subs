that's he's got he's trying to kill for
sequels<00:02:02.340> script<00:02:02.880> wise<00:02:03.750> and<00:02:04.560> he's<00:02:04.680> trying<00:02:04.979> to

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
sequels script wise and he's trying to

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.399 
sequels script wise and he's trying to
make<00:02:05.280> it<00:02:05.490> into<00:02:05.670> three

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
make it into three

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:11.240 
make it into three
and<00:02:07.499> that<00:02:08.220> is<00:02:08.580> where<00:02:08.970> I<00:02:09.390> think<00:02:10.140> his<00:02:10.560> effort<00:02:11.039> is

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
and that is where I think his effort is

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.990 
and that is where I think his effort is
going<00:02:11.780> right<00:02:12.780> now<00:02:13.069> to<00:02:14.069> keep<00:02:14.310> it<00:02:14.519> to<00:02:14.670> three

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
going right now to keep it to three

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.619 
going right now to keep it to three
sequels<00:02:15.620> because<00:02:16.620> he's<00:02:16.769> got<00:02:16.980> so<00:02:17.370> much<00:02:17.629> going

00:02:18.619 --> 00:02:18.629 
sequels because he's got so much going

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:21.680 
sequels because he's got so much going
on<00:02:18.840> how<00:02:19.830> do<00:02:19.890> you<00:02:20.069> keep<00:02:20.879> it<00:02:21.090> from<00:02:21.269> expanding

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
on how do you keep it from expanding

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:24.650 
on how do you keep it from expanding
into<00:02:22.170> that<00:02:22.410> yet<00:02:22.860> a<00:02:23.040> fourth<00:02:23.400> movie<00:02:23.940> a<00:02:24.150> fifth

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
into that yet a fourth movie a fifth

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:29.809 
into that yet a fourth movie a fifth
movie<00:02:25.049> I<00:02:25.080> guess<00:02:25.349> total<00:02:25.860> and<00:02:28.519> he'll<00:02:29.519> get<00:02:29.640> that

00:02:29.809 --> 00:02:29.819 
movie I guess total and he'll get that

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:34.820 
movie I guess total and he'll get that
sorted<00:02:30.299> out<00:02:30.480> but<00:02:31.110> it's<00:02:31.849> you<00:02:32.849> know<00:02:32.879> in<00:02:33.660> my<00:02:34.440> world
