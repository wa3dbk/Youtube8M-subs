00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:13.510 
radio-controlled plane before so we'll

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:15.419 
radio-controlled plane before so we'll
see<00:00:13.660> how<00:00:13.780> it<00:00:13.900> goes<00:00:14.139> okie<00:00:14.950> dokie

00:00:17.429 --> 00:00:17.439 
got some feet a few preflight checks to

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:33.319 
got some feet a few preflight checks to
do<00:00:17.590> and<00:00:17.800> then<00:00:18.279> we'll<00:00:18.460> be<00:00:18.580> off

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:23.650 
landing

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:36.899 
landing
take<00:01:24.520> it<00:01:24.700> all<00:01:24.880> the<00:01:24.910> way<00:01:25.060> from

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:36.909 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:47.219 

oh<00:01:43.649> look<00:01:44.649> at<00:01:44.920> that<00:01:44.950> thing<00:01:45.539> what<00:01:46.539> a<00:01:46.569> perfect

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:47.229 
oh look at that thing what a perfect

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:47.940 
oh look at that thing what a perfect
landing

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:47.950 
landing

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:51.209 
landing
hello<00:01:49.049> just<00:01:50.049> going<00:01:50.259> for<00:01:50.409> a<00:01:50.439> second<00:01:50.859> flight<00:01:51.009> the

00:01:51.209 --> 00:01:51.219 
hello just going for a second flight the

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:53.730 
hello just going for a second flight the
first<00:01:51.459> one<00:01:51.729> landed<00:01:52.509> well<00:01:52.689> so<00:01:53.109> it<00:01:53.469> might<00:01:53.619> have

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:53.740 
first one landed well so it might have

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:55.080 
first one landed well so it might have
been<00:01:53.829> a<00:01:53.890> bit<00:01:54.069> of<00:01:54.159> a<00:01:54.219> fluke<00:01:54.490> so<00:01:54.520> we're<00:01:54.909> going<00:01:55.030> to

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:55.090 
been a bit of a fluke so we're going to

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:11.710 
been a bit of a fluke so we're going to
go<00:01:55.179> for<00:01:55.359> it<00:01:55.450> again<00:01:55.479> here<00:01:56.469> we<00:01:56.560> go

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:18.820 

it<00:02:12.080> was<00:02:12.200> banking<00:02:12.590> to<00:02:12.740> the<00:02:12.770> left

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:24.620 

the<00:02:19.830> other<00:02:19.950> way<00:02:20.129> Denis

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:28.270 

all<00:02:25.020> the<00:02:25.290> way<00:02:25.410> around<00:02:25.470> hopefully

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:34.350 

very<00:02:28.850> hard<00:02:29.060> to<00:02:29.180> pick<00:02:29.420> that<00:02:29.540> up

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.720 

what<00:02:34.870> are<00:02:35.050> the<00:02:35.200> bad

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:40.000 

the<00:02:38.239> right<00:02:38.420> manner<00:02:38.690> he<00:02:39.019> plies<00:02:39.319> wells<00:02:39.650> in<00:02:39.890> there

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
the right manner he plies wells in there

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:49.110 
the right manner he plies wells in there
yeah

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:03:03.540 

I'm<00:02:50.120> gonna<00:02:50.299> go<00:02:50.450> to<00:02:50.720> the<00:02:50.810> London

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:03.550 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:08.520 

Oh<00:03:05.100> rose<00:03:06.420> well<00:03:07.420> that<00:03:07.630> was<00:03:07.720> my<00:03:07.840> second<00:03:08.230> landing

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
Oh rose well that was my second landing

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:10.320 
Oh rose well that was my second landing
so<00:03:08.800> it<00:03:09.100> wasn't<00:03:09.430> quite<00:03:09.580> as<00:03:09.730> good<00:03:09.760> as<00:03:09.970> the<00:03:10.090> first

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:10.330 
so it wasn't quite as good as the first

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:15.140 
so it wasn't quite as good as the first
but<00:03:10.630> it<00:03:10.750> and<00:03:11.020> it<00:03:11.050> looks<00:03:11.410> like<00:03:11.560> it<00:03:11.710> survives

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:57.369 

that's<00:03:16.150> right<00:03:16.420> flight<00:03:16.840> 3<00:03:17.140> :

00:03:57.369 --> 00:03:57.379 

00:03:57.379 --> 00:04:01.620 

whoa

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:01.630 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:07.880 

uh-uh

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:07.890 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:12.550 

Oh<00:04:09.830> could<00:04:10.830> you<00:04:10.950> say<00:04:11.100> this<00:04:11.280> is<00:04:11.460> number<00:04:11.670> three

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:12.560 
Oh could you say this is number three

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:14.330 
Oh could you say this is number three
okay

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.340 
okay

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:15.890 
okay
this<00:04:14.700> is<00:04:14.819> flight<00:04:15.060> now<00:04:15.270> it's<00:04:15.480> number<00:04:15.690> flight

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 
this is flight now it's number flight

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:19.250 
this is flight now it's number flight
number<00:04:16.109> four<00:04:17.030> I<00:04:18.030> think<00:04:18.540> the<00:04:18.600> battery<00:04:18.989> is

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:19.260 
number four I think the battery is

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.500 
number four I think the battery is
probably<00:04:19.530> going<00:04:20.040> to<00:04:20.100> be<00:04:20.280> this<00:04:21.120> will<00:04:21.299> be<00:04:21.390> the

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:21.510 
probably going to be this will be the

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:24.260 
probably going to be this will be the
last<00:04:21.690> flight<00:04:21.989> I've<00:04:22.590> just<00:04:23.280> crashed<00:04:23.970> it<00:04:24.180> a

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:24.270 
last flight I've just crashed it a

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:27.320 
last flight I've just crashed it a
little<00:04:24.510> bit<00:04:25.280> and<00:04:26.280> I've<00:04:26.460> cracked<00:04:26.730> the<00:04:26.880> front<00:04:27.180> of

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:27.330 
little bit and I've cracked the front of

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:29.900 
little bit and I've cracked the front of
the<00:04:27.390> plane<00:04:27.630> but<00:04:27.930> I<00:04:27.960> think<00:04:28.230> it's<00:04:28.350> okay<00:04:28.650> so<00:04:28.950> we'll

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:29.910 
the plane but I think it's okay so we'll

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:49.050 
the plane but I think it's okay so we'll
find<00:04:30.210> out<00:04:30.360> for<00:04:30.540> sure<00:04:30.570> in<00:04:30.900> a<00:04:30.960> minute<00:04:31.190> here<00:04:32.190> we<00:04:32.280> go

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:49.060 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:51.400 

right<00:04:50.060> I'm<00:04:50.480> going<00:04:50.660> to<00:04:50.720> do<00:04:50.840> a<00:04:50.870> circuit<00:04:51.350> and

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:51.410 
right I'm going to do a circuit and

00:04:51.410 --> 00:05:15.620 
right I'm going to do a circuit and
bring<00:04:51.590> it<00:04:51.710> to<00:04:51.890> life

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:15.630 

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:35.540 

here<00:05:16.350> we<00:05:16.440> go

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:35.550 

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:37.220 

you<00:05:35.940> got<00:05:36.090> that

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:37.230 
you got that

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:40.400 
you got that
really<00:05:37.590> good<00:05:38.420> flight<00:05:39.420> number<00:05:39.720> five<00:05:39.930> here<00:05:40.290> we

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:40.410 
really good flight number five here we

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:53.549 
really good flight number five here we
go<00:05:40.590> see<00:05:41.550> if<00:05:41.670> we<00:05:41.760> can<00:05:41.850> survive<00:05:42.240> this<00:05:42.450> one

00:05:53.549 --> 00:05:53.559 

00:05:53.559 --> 00:05:59.159 

oh<00:05:57.119> I<00:05:58.119> didn't<00:05:58.479> think<00:05:58.569> it<00:05:58.719> was<00:05:58.779> going<00:05:58.899> to<00:05:59.019> take

00:05:59.159 --> 00:05:59.169 
oh I didn't think it was going to take

00:05:59.169 --> 00:06:10.910 
oh I didn't think it was going to take
up

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:10.920 

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:17.100 

uh-uh

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:17.110 

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:22.129 

you've<00:06:17.770> pushing<00:06:18.159> it<00:06:18.280> out<00:06:18.370> -<00:06:18.550> with<00:06:18.669> it<00:06:19.319> this<00:06:20.319> is

00:06:22.129 --> 00:06:22.139 
you've pushing it out - with it this is

00:06:22.139 --> 00:06:36.180 
you've pushing it out - with it this is
battery

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:36.190 

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:38.250 

you
