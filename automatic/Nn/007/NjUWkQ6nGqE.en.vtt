the<00:00:21.480> comments<00:00:21.720> and<00:00:22.050> this<00:00:22.439> is<00:00:22.560> where<00:00:22.710> you<00:00:22.800> asked

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
the comments and this is where you asked

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.310 
the comments and this is where you asked
for<00:00:23.310> the<00:00:23.640> top<00:00:23.910> five<00:00:24.180> Pokemon<00:00:24.689> that<00:00:24.840> need<00:00:25.019> mega

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
for the top five Pokemon that need mega

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.349 
for the top five Pokemon that need mega
evolutions<00:00:26.420> number<00:00:27.420> five<00:00:28.670> hmm<00:00:29.670> that's<00:00:30.240> weird

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
evolutions number five hmm that's weird

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.990 
evolutions number five hmm that's weird
why<00:00:31.199> would<00:00:31.230> zangoose<00:00:31.890> be<00:00:32.070> number<00:00:32.460> five<00:00:32.700> if

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
why would zangoose be number five if

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.819 
why would zangoose be number five if
it's<00:00:33.149> my<00:00:33.270> favorite<00:00:33.630> Pokemon<00:00:34.050> well<00:00:34.649> that's

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
it's my favorite Pokemon well that's

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.590 
it's my favorite Pokemon well that's
because<00:00:35.100> this<00:00:35.370> list<00:00:35.670> is<00:00:35.820> for<00:00:36.030> pokemon<00:00:36.450> that

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
because this list is for pokemon that

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.900 
because this list is for pokemon that
actually<00:00:37.140> need<00:00:37.410> mega<00:00:37.739> evolutions<00:00:38.340> some

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
actually need mega evolutions some

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.310 
actually need mega evolutions some
zangoose<00:00:39.329> can<00:00:39.510> do<00:00:39.600> somewhat<00:00:40.050> well

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
zangoose can do somewhat well

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.740 
zangoose can do somewhat well
competitively<00:00:41.040> as<00:00:41.190> it<00:00:41.340> is<00:00:41.489> I<00:00:41.760> decided<00:00:42.420> not<00:00:42.629> to

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
competitively as it is I decided not to

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.869 
competitively as it is I decided not to
put<00:00:42.870> them<00:00:43.020> any<00:00:43.140> higher<00:00:43.320> on<00:00:43.590> the<00:00:43.710> list<00:00:43.879> Zangoose

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
put them any higher on the list Zangoose

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.459 
put them any higher on the list Zangoose
needs<00:00:45.120> a<00:00:45.210> mega<00:00:45.420> evolution<00:00:45.930> because<00:00:46.079> other

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
needs a mega evolution because other

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.139 
needs a mega evolution because other
than<00:00:46.590> its<00:00:46.890> attack<00:00:47.160> stat<00:00:47.399> it<00:00:47.670> doesn't<00:00:48.030> really

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
than its attack stat it doesn't really

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:49.790 
than its attack stat it doesn't really
have<00:00:48.360> much<00:00:48.390> a<00:00:48.870> mega<00:00:49.260> evolution<00:00:49.710> could

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
have much a mega evolution could

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.619 
have much a mega evolution could
increase<00:00:50.129> its<00:00:50.340> attack<00:00:50.610> even<00:00:50.969> more<00:00:51.180> and<00:00:51.420> give

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
increase its attack even more and give

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.720 
increase its attack even more and give
it<00:00:51.750> some<00:00:51.899> more<00:00:51.930> speed<00:00:52.379> as<00:00:52.530> well<00:00:52.710> maybe<00:00:53.430> even

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
it some more speed as well maybe even

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.430 
it some more speed as well maybe even
boost<00:00:53.910> those<00:00:54.090> defenses<00:00:54.600> a<00:00:54.629> little<00:00:54.960> they<00:00:55.289> could

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
boost those defenses a little they could

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.020 
boost those defenses a little they could
also<00:00:55.590> give<00:00:55.860> a<00:00:55.890> huge<00:00:56.190> power<00:00:56.430> for<00:00:56.730> its<00:00:56.760> ability

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
also give a huge power for its ability

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.590 
also give a huge power for its ability
now<00:00:57.660> that<00:00:57.989> would<00:00:58.170> be<00:00:58.199> an<00:00:58.379> unstoppable<00:00:58.530> monster

00:00:59.590 --> 00:00:59.600 
now that would be an unstoppable monster

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.560 
now that would be an unstoppable monster
number<00:01:00.600> 4<00:01:01.789> honcho<00:01:02.789> can<00:01:02.940> do<00:01:03.059> well<00:01:03.239> in<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:03.420> UU

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
number 4 honcho can do well in the UU

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.660 
number 4 honcho can do well in the UU
tier<00:01:03.960> but<00:01:04.350> if<00:01:04.439> it<00:01:04.530> got<00:01:04.619> a<00:01:04.680> mega<00:01:04.979> evolution<00:01:05.519> it

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
tier but if it got a mega evolution it

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.060 
tier but if it got a mega evolution it
could<00:01:05.820> definitely<00:01:06.060> become<00:01:06.570> something<00:01:06.840> more

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:07.070 
could definitely become something more

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.770 
could definitely become something more
honchos<00:01:08.070> biggest<00:01:08.490> problem<00:01:08.820> in<00:01:08.970> my<00:01:09.119> opinion<00:01:09.450> is

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
honchos biggest problem in my opinion is

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.960 
honchos biggest problem in my opinion is
its<00:01:10.020> defenses<00:01:10.560> so<00:01:11.100> if<00:01:11.189> its<00:01:11.310> mega<00:01:11.490> evolution

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
its defenses so if its mega evolution

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.789 
its defenses so if its mega evolution
had<00:01:12.090> a<00:01:12.119> bulky<00:01:12.450> design<00:01:12.750> like<00:01:12.930> this<00:01:13.140> that<00:01:13.710> would

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
had a bulky design like this that would

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.130 
had a bulky design like this that would
change<00:01:13.979> our<00:01:14.130> problems<00:01:14.580> now<00:01:15.119> honcho<00:01:15.659> speed<00:01:15.990> is

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
change our problems now honcho speed is

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.170 
change our problems now honcho speed is
already<00:01:16.439> low<00:01:16.710> as<00:01:16.860> it<00:01:16.979> is<00:01:17.130> and<00:01:17.460> if<00:01:17.729> it<00:01:17.850> got<00:01:17.970> this

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
already low as it is and if it got this

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.999 
already low as it is and if it got this
design<00:01:18.600> it<00:01:18.869> would<00:01:19.049> probably<00:01:19.530> go<00:01:19.710> lower

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
design it would probably go lower

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.609 
design it would probably go lower
however<00:01:20.880> its<00:01:21.210> defenses<00:01:21.659> with<00:01:21.780> skyrocket<00:01:22.530> and

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
however its defenses with skyrocket and

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:23.780 
however its defenses with skyrocket and
I<00:01:22.770> don't<00:01:22.950> see<00:01:23.070> why<00:01:23.189> it's<00:01:23.340> attacked<00:01:23.610> within

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
I don't see why it's attacked within

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.820 
I don't see why it's attacked within
either<00:01:24.000> couple<00:01:24.840> that<00:01:24.930> with<00:01:24.990> moxie<00:01:25.470> and<00:01:25.500> hodge

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
either couple that with moxie and hodge

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.109 
either couple that with moxie and hodge
crow<00:01:26.070> would<00:01:26.220> be<00:01:26.400> one<00:01:26.640> of<00:01:26.759> the<00:01:26.850> scariest

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
crow would be one of the scariest

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.580 
crow would be one of the scariest
Pokemon<00:01:27.720> a<00:01:27.750> deal<00:01:27.960> with<00:01:28.460> number<00:01:29.460> three<00:01:30.470> one<00:01:31.470> of

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
the most important things to know about

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.819 
the most important things to know about
mega<00:01:33.119> evolution<00:01:33.689> is<00:01:33.810> that<00:01:33.930> a<00:01:33.960> pokemons<00:01:34.409> HP

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
mega evolution is that a pokemons HP

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.649 
mega evolution is that a pokemons HP
does<00:01:35.070> not<00:01:35.280> change<00:01:35.670> and<00:01:36.030> that's<00:01:36.390> a<00:01:36.450> good<00:01:36.600> thing

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
does not change and that's a good thing

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.190 
does not change and that's a good thing
