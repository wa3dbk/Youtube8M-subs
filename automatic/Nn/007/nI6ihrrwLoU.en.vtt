wire jewelry hammer and I've designed

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.740 
wire jewelry hammer and I've designed
this<00:01:15.270> specifically<00:01:16.200> for<00:01:17.100> wire<00:01:17.340> work<00:01:17.610> and<00:01:17.939> it

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
this specifically for wire work and it

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.990 
this specifically for wire work and it
really<00:01:18.900> has<00:01:19.229> all<00:01:19.409> the<00:01:19.770> best<00:01:20.070> attributes<00:01:20.340> of

really has all the best attributes of
these<00:01:21.659> three<00:01:23.720> here<00:01:24.720> you've<00:01:25.049> got<00:01:25.259> the<00:01:25.409> convex

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
these three here you've got the convex

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.490 
these three here you've got the convex
head<00:01:26.490> it's<00:01:27.180> highly<00:01:27.509> polished<00:01:27.720> it<00:01:28.170> means<00:01:28.380> it

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
head it's highly polished it means it

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.499 
head it's highly polished it means it
doesn't<00:01:28.530> mark<00:01:29.009> the<00:01:29.159> metal<00:01:29.490> and<00:01:29.820> it<00:01:30.000> spreads

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
doesn't mark the metal and it spreads

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.660 
doesn't mark the metal and it spreads
the<00:01:30.600> metal<00:01:30.960> out<00:01:31.049> and<00:01:31.320> worked<00:01:31.500> hardens<00:01:32.250> it<00:01:32.430> and

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
the metal out and worked hardens it and

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.539 
the metal out and worked hardens it and
then<00:01:33.329> you've<00:01:33.509> got<00:01:33.689> the<00:01:33.840> nylon<00:01:34.350> site<00:01:34.680> which<00:01:35.310> is

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549
