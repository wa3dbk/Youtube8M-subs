00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:06.060
 the bear forest müritz of four paws in 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.090
 mecklenburg-western pomerania is one of the 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.889
 bears just hang in germany 

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:12.599
 on the nature of corresponding feeding 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.059
 concept brings the animals away 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.190
 Disturbed behavior behaves like this 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.800
 their attitude in the bear forest müritz 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.990
 and that's how bears look in berlin 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.420
 In the middle of the fence lies in one 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.320
 residential district at the march museum and is 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.910
 visible from all sides 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:33.540
 here live the brown bear maxi and 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:35.820
 I've been getting a lot of attention for many years 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.770
 small and irritable attitude has at the 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.360
 animals already leave a mark 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:43.890
 both show conspicuous 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:45.480
 Behavioral disorders include: 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.309
 other like here at schnute 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.980
 the repeated expiration of one 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:52.860
 established route as well as repeated 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.350
 circular movements with the head at maxi 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.879
 expresses this abnormal 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:58.710
 Behavior pattern also in the turn 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.840
 of the head in some occasions 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.960
 is the entire upper body with 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:06.360
 So included these behaviors 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:09.210
 the maxim tailors lay that one day 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:12.570
 very clear stereotypes only 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.280
 occur in bears who are just in 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.500
 poor attitudes are accommodated 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.790
 especially not enough space 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.530
 they are just too little 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.780
 employment means that is it 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.790
 obviously that will be here 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.860
 Do not go well in the Berlin kennel 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.990
 müritz in the bear forest would be very 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.670
 modern in richmond program through the 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.560
 So that means a job program 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.540
 for bears 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.170
 the just under strong behavior patterns 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:39.930
 to suffer under strong cities 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:43.100
 this usually leads to success that the 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:45.659
 Bears completely put off these strategies 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:47.100
 but at least that for me very much 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:50.460
 that means that bears are reduced 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:53.490
 So really, these behave constantly 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.780
 four meters left and right run that 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.860
 they put that down because they are foraging 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.729
 are because they are busy and that 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:03.079
 i promise myself of maxi and schnute 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.079
 then in the future 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:13.150
 25 october 2012 stocktaking the 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:15.850
 size is official with 480 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:17.980
 square meters are deducted 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:19.900
 But the ditch and the 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:23.050
 area for the keepers and the 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:25.420
 feed warehouse in the house is partly the 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:27.720
 Concrete floor covered with bark mulch 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:30.340
 thin to dig in it 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.240
 way too steep stairs lead into one 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.160
 moat 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:36.150
 on which the water is already left out 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:38.590
 bathing is no longer possible here 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:40.990
 the employment objects become 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:44.340
 obviously not used for that 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:44.340
 to drive away the boredom 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:50.650
 because the feeds almost exclusively 

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:52.750
 inside the kennel 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:53.890
 The bears do not inspire the outdoor area 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:55.900
 visit 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:58.450
 That's why they stop for lack of time 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:02.230
 irritate excessively in the interior of the 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:04.420
 Zwingers has been trying hard for years 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:06.970
 four paws to take over the animals 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:09.010
 in the bear forest müritz the district 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:10.750
 berlin-middle refuses to today 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:13.060
 four paws to cooperate 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:15.400
 the bad conditions of 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:17.080
 Maxi and Schnute have been around for a long time 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:20.080
 the population arrived 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:22.540
 Therefore, four paws hopes that for the 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:24.880
 berlin bear bears district council 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:27.010
 middle insight shows and holds that 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:31.290
 offer for the takeover of the animals in 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:31.290
 the bear forest müritz still upright
