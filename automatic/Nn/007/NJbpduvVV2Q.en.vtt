00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:06.630
 good morning everyone and welcome to me 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.850
 channel once again hearts 1991 in this 

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:11.220
 I bring you a video tutorial on 

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:14.640
 which I am going to show you 

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:18.030
 how to make a collage of photos or what 

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:20.940
 It is a presentation with photos and background 

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:22.410
 with a song 

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:23.730
 I will teach how to do it so that 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.460
 you make your own album 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:29.150
 electronic photo presentation and 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:32.700
 put the music of your preference 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:34.190
 well let's proceed first of all 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.890
 we are going to 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:39.280
 get the photos in an accessible place 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:41.449
 for example that I have mine 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:45.010
 select any anything else for 

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:45.010
 to give the example are all these 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:50.270
 it is noteworthy that the format 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:53.140
 recognizes the program that we are going to use 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:57.579
 what is this total video converter 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:59.140
 you do not have to put a jpg format that 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:01.750
 Most of the images are already 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:04.120
 this format and I have these two for 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:06.010
 that you see 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:08.980
 that is not going to grab them good 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:12.030
 example this png will not recognize it 

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:12.030
 because it 's another format 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:20.939
 well let's open the video the program 

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:20.939
 total forgiveness video converter 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.160
 it is very simple to do this we are not going to 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:30.440
 give nothing else here where I design case 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:30.440
 then import photos 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:37.580
 we search where we have them stored 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:40.320
 in my case it is the desk 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:44.480
 and we will select the all 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:46.700
 and we add picchu 

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:49.400
 and this announcement comes out because of what I said 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:52.490
 is the image that ends with 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:54.210
 termination png tells us that the format 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:56.040
 it is invalid 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:59.550
 and nothing else is the one that is not going to 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:02.280
 add to the list 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:03.960
 well then already once we have 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.090
 that if they want, they can change the 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.880
 format the image and add if in your 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:11.370
 case they have pure png because they can 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:13.569
 transform into a is very simple to 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.640
 end of the video I explain it 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:17.889
 good and once we have add 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.810
 the images we are going to add now what 

00:02:17.889 --> 00:02:23.400
 what is the song 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:23.400
 we look for music 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:32.909
 for example I will add this to him 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.920
 we give the selection to mos and we have to 

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:36.659
 give it to add audio because if we give 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.790
 double click on the file will close us 

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:40.469
 The whole project is the same with the 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.150
 photos you have to select help you 

00:02:40.469 --> 00:02:43.730
 add fiction you have to use these 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.860
 buttons 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:47.900
 we give you good to add audio and they are fixed 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:50.170
 was added and we can add those that 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.170
 we want 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:55.680
 3 to 4 we wait for Asia if it is 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.319
 very long photo presentation 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:00.800
 ends a song and continues in which 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:02.480
 follows him and so on 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:04.160
 well once we arrived, he added 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:07.190
 both photos and music 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:09.740
 we select the first image and we 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:12.050
 let's go where it says select aspect 

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:14.690
 which is the transition effect that 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:18.380
 let's give each picture here these 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:20.840
 tabs come different effects by 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:22.760
 example I'm going to select this and you 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:24.500
 we give ok 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:26.450
 and you will be assigned to each 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:29.629
 picture a different equipment effect 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:31.069
 we should notice how each one moves 

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:34.069
 different 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:37.700
 well after that if you want here in 

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:40.609
 settings we can move the time this is 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:41.930
 the time it will take between each 

00:03:40.609 --> 00:03:44.269
 change of image for example that I 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:46.280
 I have three seconds and I'm going to leave it and 

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:49.430
 how much we want the effect of the 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:52.099
 Transition of the image 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:54.730
 if it's two seconds and here the width 

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:57.670
 by the high 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:04:00.239
 frames per second images by 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:03.030
 second among more have more quality 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:06.900
 but I recommend that we leave them like this 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:06.900
 well then we give ok 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.850
 and if you want to see a preview here 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:13.820
 can see it 

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:17.440
 the play button to see how it's going to 

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:17.440
 to be more or less its presentation 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:24.020
 we give stop xxi and already once 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:26.380
 we're finished, we're just going to 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:26.380
 give ok 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:30.910
 and he's going to throw this window 

00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:34.910
 automatically and we select the 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:36.920
 format in which we want to convert it 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:38.150
 for example I'm going to put it in format 

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:41.390
 bird 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:43.250
 we select them and the only thing we have 

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:45.370
 what to do is to hit the convert button 

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:45.370
 now 

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:50.380
 what will take in the conversion goes 

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:53.560
 to depend on the number of photos that 

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:56.289
 have both the music they have and the 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:58.300
 quality of each of the photos 

00:04:56.289 --> 00:05:00.990
 but as you can see it does not take much 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:00.990
 anyway 

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:07.820
 and once it's finished , it's going to open the 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:11.889
 automatically window in which 

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:13.749
 He produced the video that is on us 

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:15.510
 I'll play it below for 

00:05:13.749 --> 00:05:18.210
 that you see 

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:20.160
 well you wonder why the 

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:21.840
 volume because what happens is that it has 

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:23.880
 to configure and the right music of 

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:26.340
 author but if it's the same procedure 

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:29.600
 that I did that is going to reproduce the 

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:29.600
 music without any problem 

00:05:29.639 --> 00:05:33.449
 and for example the 

00:05:31.409 --> 00:05:36.539
 presentation is fixed instead between a 

00:05:33.449 --> 00:05:38.610
 image and another and the background music but 

00:05:36.539 --> 00:05:40.349
 because for obvious reasons you can not 

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:42.560
 reproduce it I can not increase the 

00:05:40.349 --> 00:05:42.560
 volume 

00:05:50.249 --> 00:05:54.899
 and as we can see it looks pretty 

00:05:52.229 --> 00:05:57.659
 well and here select the avi format 

00:05:54.899 --> 00:06:01.529
 you already select the format of your taste 

00:05:57.659 --> 00:06:04.789
 to make it heavier lighter more 

00:06:01.529 --> 00:06:04.789
 quality less quality 

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:10.800
 good friends as 

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:16.370
 that's all I hope and serve you this 

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:19.729
 video tutorial and see you in a next
