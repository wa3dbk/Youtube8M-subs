maintenance and how to prolong its life
such<00:00:15.980> as<00:00:16.450> cleaning<00:00:17.450> your<00:00:17.630> bearings<00:00:18.140> rotating

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:19.040 
such as cleaning your bearings rotating

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:21.130 
such as cleaning your bearings rotating
your<00:00:19.160> wheels<00:00:19.370> and<00:00:19.880> standing<00:00:20.660> down<00:00:20.840> the<00:00:20.990> edges

of<00:00:21.260> your<00:00:21.380> board<00:00:21.680> what<00:00:22.340> you're<00:00:22.460> going<00:00:22.610> to<00:00:22.700> need

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:22.820 
of your board what you're going to need

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:26.050 
of your board what you're going to need
is<00:00:23.350> obviously<00:00:24.350> a<00:00:24.470> skate<00:00:24.890> tool<00:00:25.130> some<00:00:25.640> bearing

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:26.060 
is obviously a skate tool some bearing

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:28.270 
is obviously a skate tool some bearing
lubricant<00:00:26.570> but<00:00:26.720> if<00:00:26.960> some<00:00:27.230> methylated<00:00:27.800> spirits

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:28.280

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:30.370 
lubricant but if some methylated spirits
are<00:00:28.520> bones<00:00:28.940> bearing<00:00:29.480> cleaner<00:00:29.720> but<00:00:30.200> if<00:00:30.289> you

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:30.380 
are bones bearing cleaner but if you

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:33.310 
are bones bearing cleaner but if you
don't<00:00:30.619> own<00:00:30.770> one<00:00:30.980> of<00:00:31.010> these<00:00:31.280> then<00:00:31.880> just<00:00:32.419> a<00:00:32.570> small

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:33.320 
don't own one of these then just a small

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.770 
don't own one of these then just a small
container<00:00:33.710> will<00:00:33.980> suffice<00:00:34.339> and<00:00:34.640> finally<00:00:35.510> a

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:35.780 
container will suffice and finally a

sounded this skateboard down

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:49.899 
sounded this skateboard down
occasionally<00:00:48.440> this<00:00:49.190> ship<00:00:49.519> wouldn't<00:00:49.819> have

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:49.909 
occasionally this ship wouldn't have

occasionally this ship wouldn't have
happened<00:00:50.239> it's<00:00:51.079> a<00:00:51.199> pretty<00:00:51.379> simple<00:00:51.649> process

00:00:51.819 --> 00:00:51.829 
happened it's a pretty simple process

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:54.939 
happened it's a pretty simple process
really<00:00:52.510> first<00:00:53.510> of<00:00:53.629> all<00:00:53.749> you<00:00:53.989> locate<00:00:54.589> a<00:00:54.620> rough

00:00:54.939 --> 00:00:54.949 
really first of all you locate a rough

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:56.950 
really first of all you locate a rough
patch<00:00:55.219> on<00:00:55.460> the<00:00:55.489> edge<00:00:55.699> of<00:00:55.850> the<00:00:55.969> skateboard<00:00:56.449> once

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:56.960 
patch on the edge of the skateboard once

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:58.809 
patch on the edge of the skateboard once
you've<00:00:57.170> found<00:00:57.379> one<00:00:57.710> you<00:00:58.309> should<00:00:58.489> apply<00:00:58.789> a

00:00:58.809 --> 00:00:58.819 
you've found one you should apply a

00:00:58.819 --> 00:01:01.239 
you've found one you should apply a
reasonable<00:00:59.510> amount<00:00:59.629> of<00:00:59.899> pressure<00:01:00.170> and<00:01:00.530> stand

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:01.249 
reasonable amount of pressure and stand

00:01:01.249 --> 00:01:07.530 
reasonable amount of pressure and stand
accordingly<00:01:01.729> like<00:01:02.149> this

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:07.540 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:09.730 

once<00:01:08.540> you<00:01:08.690> have<00:01:08.720> sanded<00:01:09.200> the<00:01:09.290> rough<00:01:09.500> patch

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:09.740 
once you have sanded the rough patch

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:11.650 
once you have sanded the rough patch
away<00:01:10.070> you'll<00:01:10.700> find<00:01:10.940> that<00:01:11.120> the<00:01:11.210> edge<00:01:11.360> of<00:01:11.570> the

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:11.660 
away you'll find that the edge of the

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:14.470 
away you'll find that the edge of the
deck<00:01:11.870> is<00:01:12.110> much<00:01:12.380> smoother<00:01:12.920> but<00:01:13.460> be<00:01:13.670> sure<00:01:13.700> not<00:01:13.970> to

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:14.480 
deck is much smoother but be sure not to

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:16.780 
deck is much smoother but be sure not to
sound<00:01:14.660> too<00:01:14.810> much<00:01:15.200> in<00:01:15.410> one<00:01:15.440> area<00:01:15.860> because<00:01:16.640> you

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:16.790 
sound too much in one area because you

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:18.220 
sound too much in one area because you
could<00:01:17.000> find<00:01:17.300> that<00:01:17.510> your<00:01:17.630> board<00:01:17.840> has<00:01:17.960> become

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:18.230 
could find that your board has become

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:20.620 
could find that your board has become
miss<00:01:18.530> shape<00:01:18.830> now<00:01:19.820> that<00:01:19.970> we've<00:01:20.060> got<00:01:20.210> that<00:01:20.240> taken

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:20.630 
miss shape now that we've got that taken

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:22.630 
miss shape now that we've got that taken
care<00:01:20.780> of<00:01:20.990> the<00:01:21.200> next<00:01:21.530> step<00:01:21.740> is<00:01:21.950> cleaning<00:01:22.550> your

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:22.640 
care of the next step is cleaning your

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.640 
care of the next step is cleaning your
bearings<00:01:23.030> what<00:01:23.510> you<00:01:23.600> want<00:01:23.750> to<00:01:23.810> do<00:01:23.960> is<00:01:24.200> find<00:01:24.560> the

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:24.650 
bearings what you want to do is find the

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:26.560 
bearings what you want to do is find the
right<00:01:24.890> fitting<00:01:25.190> in<00:01:25.370> your<00:01:25.490> skate<00:01:25.760> tool<00:01:26.000> and<00:01:26.270> put

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:26.570 
right fitting in your skate tool and put

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:29.980 
right fitting in your skate tool and put
it<00:01:26.660> over<00:01:26.780> your<00:01:26.960> actual<00:01:27.410> book<00:01:28.450> then<00:01:29.450> move<00:01:29.840> the

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:37.890 
and last the longest time possible it

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:40.910 
and last the longest time possible it
also<00:04:38.100> helps<00:04:38.460> if<00:04:39.300> if<00:04:39.690> you<00:04:40.170> have<00:04:40.320> the<00:04:40.470> graphic

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:40.920 
also helps if if you have the graphic

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:43.280 
also helps if if you have the graphic
facing<00:04:41.370> outwards<00:04:41.880> to<00:04:42.480> flip<00:04:42.750> it<00:04:42.780> in<00:04:43.050> words

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:43.290 
facing outwards to flip it in words

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:46.340 
facing outwards to flip it in words
which<00:04:43.890> also<00:04:44.160> allows<00:04:44.640> it<00:04:45.060> to<00:04:45.090> wear<00:04:45.390> evenly<00:04:45.750> it's

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:46.350 
which also allows it to wear evenly it's

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:48.290 
which also allows it to wear evenly it's
now<00:04:46.530> time<00:04:46.590> to<00:04:46.980> put<00:04:47.010> your<00:04:47.280> wheel<00:04:47.460> back<00:04:47.700> on<00:04:47.730> this

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:48.300 
now time to put your wheel back on this
