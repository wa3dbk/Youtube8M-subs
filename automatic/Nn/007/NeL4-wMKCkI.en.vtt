00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.279
 Hello, I want to tell you today 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.770
 about batteries 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:09.929
 what they are and how to competently 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:13.139
 use them to serve 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:15.990
 as long as possible well let's start by 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:19.560
 order now i want to show you 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:26.189
 disassembled laptop battery here it is 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:29.250
 from samsung lithium-ion battery gave 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:36.660
 11 1 volt 5 thousand 200 milliamp hours 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:40.579
 there was no capacity in two parts here on 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:44.430
 double-sided tape were glued 6 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:48.079
 cans called generally ok them 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:53.000
 called cells but in the people for some reason 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:53.000
 so call them banks 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:01:01.260
 Well, it doesn't matter so it looked 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:07.200
 of yes here's another charge controller board 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:10.110
 without it in any way if in the window of the black battery 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.689
 there is a charge controller board then in 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.570
 each of these cells well or in 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:18.710
 common cans charge controller 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:22.170
 missing it is necessary to understand 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:24.150
 well, and so since it was collected of course 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:29.820
 it was all packed tightly and beautifully 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:32.220
 I already raskurochil here and you now 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.430
 look at the new battery new 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.430
 battery 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:45.450
 14 and 8 volts 2670 milliampere hours 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:47.570
 lithium-ion battery is also new as 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.850
 extend the service life as much as possible 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:53.159
 Your new battery is not important 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.560
 The battery is valid from the phone or from 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:58.640
 laptop doesn't matter or in the field 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:02.960
 battery or camera first 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:05.640
 simple rule I do not stand constantly 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:09.179
 discharge to zero and slaughter to 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.879
 the maximum would be best to keep 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.140
 charge somewhere within 

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:15.260
 minimum 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:18.860
 a 20 percent maximum after charging 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:20.750
 that was 80 percent here and so 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.430
 hold charge and will work normally 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:26.959
 as long as possible 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:30.080
 but it is worth saying at least not 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:33.520
 at least it is recommended to do once a month 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:37.820
 full charge and full discharge 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:41.410
 this is needed to calibrate the controller 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:44.270
 charge to this one 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:46.310
 correctly determined the capacity I correctly 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:49.850
 showed the remaining time to the end 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:50.620
 work and correctly showed others 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:53.600
 options 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:56.750
 because here once a month 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:03:00.980
 need to do a full discharge cycle 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:04.340
 to zero and charging up to 100 percent a 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:07.100
 throughout the month, keep the charge from 20 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:10.269
 up to 80 percent will help as much as possible 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:13.610
 long extend battery life 

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:15.940
 also interesting advice not worth it 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:18.590
 overheat for example above 40 degrees 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:22.310
 Lithium-ion batteries do not heat up 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:24.489
 it is generally recommended that they have a limit of 60 but 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:27.260
 so that they serve for a long time 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:31.190
 best to keep somewhere around forty 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:33.560
 percent 40 degrees Celsius and not 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:37.760
 cool them below zero too 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:40.730
 I do not remember can work up to -20 but 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:42.980
 again for maximum maximum 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:48.260
 service life hold 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:49.489
 to underground temperature below 0 that's what 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.670
 also want to note 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:53.660
 if you are not going to use 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:55.150
 battery for a long time well, let's say 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:58.070
 month 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:04:02.870
 leave a charge of about 40 

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:05.180
 40 percent or 50 percent charge there 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:08.630
 this is the optimal long-term such 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:10.609
 capacity let's say here in the laptop I now 

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:12.380
 I don't use my battery right now 

00:04:10.609 --> 00:04:14.840
 on the table is from the outlet works 

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:19.010
 battery is up to forty percent 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:22.130
 and once a month I check that he doesn't 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:24.600
 discharged and charge it because 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:27.270
 he is this very month 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:27.930
 loses a little capacity due to the 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:30.330
 discharge 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:33.120
 all batteries have batteries 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:35.250
 self discharge because keep the capacity for 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:40.890
 long-term storage at 40 percent 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:44.130
 and check once a month 

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:47.040
 so she didn't call 40 and as I already 

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:51.570
 said doing a full discharge cycle and 

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:52.670
 Charging here and now tell a little 

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:56.000
 about 

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:59.060
 nickel metal hydride batteries 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:02.250
 such here I have them 

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:06.990
 finger fingers little or 

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:10.100
 the official name is two and three and but in 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:14.220
 common fingerless little fingers 

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:16.130
 so why is it clearer in these 

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:19.160
 battery voltage 

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:22.260
 rated one point two volts 

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:27.600
 while u lithium ion 

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:28.320
 rated voltage 3.7 volts and this 

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:31.800
 need to understand 

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:34.140
 because as 1 time disposable 

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:36.510
 battery replacement with disposable batteries 

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:39.450
 perfect just such a comet 

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:39.990
 you will not find aleon ionics anywhere 

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:42.060
 quality 

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:45.210
 Here is such a form because 

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:50.010
 their voltage is too high and you 

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:51.840
 burn the device where to insert them yet 

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:54.780
 interesting fact not to go 

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:56.400
 nickel metal hydride not exposed 

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:59.660
 They say that the memory effect 

00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:02.640
 but in fact it is still a bit pronounced 

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:05.240
 someone says that he is a little pronounced 

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:10.010
 someone says that it is not at all because 

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:11.160
 my opinion is the same as 

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:15.620
 lithium ion 

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:19.140
 annoy them once a month let's say 

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:24.120
 fully and then charge it again 

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:28.190
 will help reset so let's say zero so 

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:28.190
 let's say the memory effect if it is 

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:32.810
 voltage 

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:36.720
 minimum allowable for lithium-ion 

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:38.040
 this is 3 volts maximum at 

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:41.400
 100 percent charge 

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:42.360
 four point two tenths of a volt and at the 

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:45.360
 time like u 

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:49.350
 Nickel metal hydride minimum at 

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:50.990
 discharge is 0 9 volts and maximum 

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:55.830
 at full 

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:59.000
 one hundred percent charging 1 and 4 volts this 

00:06:55.830 --> 00:07:01.590
 need to know by the way 

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:03.990
 nickel metal hydride well can 

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:06.600
 work even with negative 

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:08.940
 temperatures as opposed to 

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:14.640
 find and he in which negative 

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:17.610
 temperatures are not recommended well in general 

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:19.800
 I hope you all had it 

00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:23.960
 interesting useful information hope 

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:23.960
 learned to everyone happily everyone bye
