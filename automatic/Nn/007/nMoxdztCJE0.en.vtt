00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:05.010
 now we agree 

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:08.010
 now with the truth 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.139
 this 

00:00:14.589 --> 00:00:18.910
 we are with david garza technology director the mb and we are my mom 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:22.529
 to have options there is precisely this 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.260
 tesla in addition to radeon hd six thousand 870 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.380
 that has a power of all teraflops 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:36.050
 and that's really a very high power for an energy consumption of penalties 151 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:36.760
 watts 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:40.069
 the pdp maximum power of consumption not 

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:43.190
 normally when this card is not performing 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:48.839
 Absolutely no work demanding your energy consumption is just 19 4 

00:00:48.839 --> 00:00:52.150
 which ensures you have incredible performance 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:56.540
 but without having to punish you your pocket we are seeing here has 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:58.150
 enough this way outlets 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:02.390
 I tell you a little about all these efforts, of course, if we do not have 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.840
 the my that you are version 1 point 4 a 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:11.000
 the the hdmi 1 point 4 to which you allow yourself to be able to connect televisions 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.530
 new vélez 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:15.070
 where are you going to be able to have an enjoyment 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:20.040
 This is precisely because the new standard allows your 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:25.870
 you can draw images to more than 120 sherry and that p allows you to touch the third 

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:26.600
 dimension 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.250
 when you wear your glasses 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:32.310
 because normally it covers the image of an eye and then the image of the 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:33.079
 another eye 

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:36.450
 and if that's done to 60 jesus you're going to have a lot 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.050
 efe papaleo in the image or 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:41.590
 but already with the new standard 1 point 4 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:44.150
 you will be able to have the third dimension 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:49.310
 the artist the images to the act sits Jesus for each eye is not 120 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:50.320
 cases in total 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:53.270
 whereby by enjoying the third dimension of doing 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:57.590
 much better among many other things that have to do with improve the sound 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.789
 with the best in the one of the colors and so on etcetera by addition 

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:05.619
 has two displayport outputs that are not oriented like hdmi 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:11.660
 only digital entertainment but these for these demands of 

00:02:11.659 --> 00:02:15.200
 video as for example to have an excellent resolution 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.310
 percent in autocad for example 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:21.920
 or in demanding games that can go far beyond high definition 

00:02:22.619 --> 00:02:25.929
 and we also have two medvedev exits and 

00:02:25.929 --> 00:02:27.820
 so they can connect 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:31.590
 pure digital monitors taking into account that already the points of gea 

00:02:32.139 --> 00:02:36.459
 but little by little they have been declining in terms of their percent and assume the 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:40.939
 market not then well as you see it has a lot instan is one of the 

00:02:40.939 --> 00:02:42.359
 better news than 

00:02:42.359 --> 00:02:45.819
 Can connect up to four monitors 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:47.290
 four monitors 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:50.380
 with the new technology adif invested 2 points 0 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:54.770
 this new infiniti technology allows you to extend the desktop 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:58.810
 up to four monitors so you can have a graphic experience 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:04.120
 as you can see it there at some point that the camera was captured 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.240
 longed for the exploding computer 

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:09.790
 where the four monitors are living together so we can give a 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:11.440
 huge screen 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:15.650
 If you can do with small partners monitor, imagine connecting 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:19.760
 minutes quite a lot of May they are presenting us wake 68 50 that I can still 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:23.380
 until the 2 available all are fully available at present 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:26.479
 in fact you can already access them 

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:31.729
 for the information that I have the 68 50 has a price of jalapa 

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:34.550
 230 dollars dealers 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:37.170
 and the 68 70 that is being 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:42.680
 has a distributor price of roughly $ 270 these are capable 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.400
 otín in the capacity of 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.109
 connecting them for example that failures and I want to pascal 

00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:51.379
 but of course of poplar of its arcs to fail x to propose up to four cards 

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:52.770
 of these videos 

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:55.870
 and if by itself with only once are these teraflops 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:59.420
 Imagine what you did not know how to defend with four cards delivered 

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:02.639
 now in January do not be a surprise 

00:04:02.639 --> 00:04:08.299
 it would cost us a little that weight if the woman you the beginning of the death of the 

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:10.740
 cpv as we know it 

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:16.210
 because the cp uu by itself as we know it is already a very 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:19.459
 limited to give you ponches processing power 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:25.139
 what we are going to do percent and do not tell anyone is this present the 

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:29.059
 first processor would be the parallel of the world 

00:04:29.059 --> 00:04:33.350
 taking into account that teachers are usually serial only 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:37.590
 and in this type of diet technology what you have is parallel processing 

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:40.879
 good what we're going to do is present a processor 

00:04:40.879 --> 00:04:44.110
 it would be the parallel palate that is not going to happen anymore 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:46.980
 it's going to be something else totally different 

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:51.570
 what some could relate it to some seller of the series of 

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:55.750
 simpson guillén cuervo already know that they are already available up to 

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:57.309
 video 

00:04:57.309 --> 00:04:58.360
 for 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:03.970
 to whom it is aimed at enthusiastic architects designers in general 

00:05:03.969 --> 00:05:05.970
 is directed enthusiasts 

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:09.200
 although some designers can have access to them 

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:13.090
 but to him for the designers it is recommended our serious failures pro 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:18.490
 for him it's professional requirements but stop the players the enthusiasts 

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:23.830
 video editors because they can have this type of card and with a 

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:27.020
 extraordinary performance without punishing or pocket 

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:31.110
 nor have excessive energy consumption commented as many do not know is something 

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:31.780
 more to do 

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:35.430
 what about the technology cards, yes one of the things that I want 

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:39.190
 add is that although this card is totally oriented 

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:44.330
 to be able to give life to our platform our technologies vision request 

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:45.449
 of silver 

00:05:45.449 --> 00:05:50.259
 p where our processor aldf name x6 is integrated 

00:05:50.259 --> 00:05:54.160
 our zmd chip of the series 8 90 fx 

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:59.870
 and in the 6800 video card series I want to tell you that if you have a 

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:04.520
 computer that does not have an infrastructure mt you can also 

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:05.120
 use 

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:06.150
 Thus 

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:10.710
 this is not limited to that your machine had to be all mb if not that if you 

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:14.870
 you have some other computing infrastructure that there are and I have been told no 

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:19.590
 you can connect and go can do is get the most out of it with a card 

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:26.729
 you will see m slander war that is crossed out of six thousand 850 by 6 thousand 870 pure as 

00:06:26.729 --> 00:06:28.370
 last question 

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:32.370
 percent what would your list always make us talked about the candle balance 

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:36.020
 a computer not so to have a vote engine with the house of Ferrari not 

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:37.080
 so 

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:37.919
 what would it be like 

00:06:37.919 --> 00:06:38.930
 or the cp uu 

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:43.419
 or the processor that could balance your very well with this part the best 

00:06:43.419 --> 00:06:48.639
 to use it in muddy mdc did not want me 4 blake vision by the a md 

00:06:48.639 --> 00:06:49.919
 x6 phenomenon 

00:06:49.919 --> 00:06:54.449
 this one also from the black edition series not if you have technology you should 

00:06:54.449 --> 00:06:57.530
 give from some other manufacturer the best thing is to use 

00:06:57.530 --> 00:07:02.050
 the highest technologies they can have in order to balance the 

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:05.240
 performance with park status cta and they can send them 

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:08.350
 for the necessary signals so that this card can be 

00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:09.849
 this 

00:07:09.849 --> 00:07:11.750
 the one of the best work for example 

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:16.490
 I have been told there are and five something and 7 something I am not sure 

00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:19.720
 but he owned you can have that guy this kind of cards 

00:07:20.419 --> 00:07:23.650
 thank you very much david you already know because these two cards are already available 

00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:25.129
 of video by others those 

00:07:25.129 --> 00:07:28.129
 enthusiasts and that are not right 

00:07:29.129 --> 00:07:30.790
 mobile broadband telcel 

00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:31.620
 roberto durán 

00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:32.840
 this speed rise
