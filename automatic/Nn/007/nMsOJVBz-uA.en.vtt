with the mid side technique it's fairly

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:18.870 
with the mid side technique it's fairly
simple<00:02:17.020> it's<00:02:17.560> actually<00:02:17.739> a<00:02:17.950> combination<00:02:18.280> of

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
ambience now a minute ago I mentioned

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:47.160 
ambience now a minute ago I mentioned
that<00:02:45.490> the<00:02:45.610> mid<00:02:45.819> side<00:02:46.120> technique<00:02:46.569> is<00:02:46.720> popular

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
that the mid side technique is popular

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:49.470 
that the mid side technique is popular
in<00:02:47.350> the<00:02:47.440> audio<00:02:47.800> for<00:02:48.130> video<00:02:48.250> world<00:02:48.730> and<00:02:49.000> one

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
in the audio for video world and one

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.120 
in the audio for video world and one
reason<00:02:49.990> is<00:02:50.170> that<00:02:50.230> it<00:02:50.470> allows<00:02:50.709> the<00:02:50.920> sound

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 
reason is that it allows the sound

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:52.949 
reason is that it allows the sound
engineer<00:02:51.610> to<00:02:51.730> get<00:02:51.850> exactly<00:02:52.300> the<00:02:52.480> balance<00:02:52.810> they

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:52.959 
engineer to get exactly the balance they

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:54.930 
engineer to get exactly the balance they
want<00:02:53.230> between<00:02:53.890> the<00:02:54.040> mid<00:02:54.250> where<00:02:54.490> the<00:02:54.640> sound

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
want between the mid where the sound

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:56.790 
want between the mid where the sound
source<00:02:55.300> is<00:02:55.360> coming<00:02:55.660> from<00:02:55.840> and<00:02:56.200> the<00:02:56.470> sides

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:56.800 
source is coming from and the sides

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:59.280 
source is coming from and the sides
where<00:02:57.130> we<00:02:57.220> get<00:02:57.370> our<00:02:57.459> stereo<00:02:57.820> depth<00:02:58.150> and<00:02:58.390> it's<00:02:59.200> a

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
where we get our stereo depth and it's a

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:01.380 
where we get our stereo depth and it's a
format<00:02:59.680> that<00:02:59.830> holds<00:03:00.130> up<00:03:00.250> well<00:03:00.489> if<00:03:00.760> the<00:03:01.060> mix<00:03:01.270> is

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:01.390 
format that holds up well if the mix is

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:03.180 
format that holds up well if the mix is
some<00:03:01.630> tamaño<00:03:02.080> which<00:03:02.590> is<00:03:02.709> an<00:03:02.800> important

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.190 
some tamaño which is an important

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:05.790 
some tamaño which is an important

traffic island in Manhattan to give you
a<00:03:44.079> better<00:03:44.230> idea<00:03:44.500> of<00:03:44.739> how<00:03:45.010> the<00:03:45.190> MS<00:03:45.640> or<00:03:45.880> mid<00:03:46.060> side

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:46.329 
a better idea of how the MS or mid side

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:48.030 
a better idea of how the MS or mid side
technique<00:03:46.780> actually<00:03:46.959> sounds<00:03:47.620> if<00:03:47.860> you<00:03:47.950> have

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:48.040 
technique actually sounds if you have

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:49.890 
technique actually sounds if you have
headphones<00:03:48.310> put<00:03:49.150> them<00:03:49.299> on<00:03:49.480> I'll<00:03:49.660> give<00:03:49.780> you<00:03:49.840> a

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:49.900 
headphones put them on I'll give you a

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:51.960 
headphones put them on I'll give you a
better<00:03:50.110> sense<00:03:50.350> of<00:03:50.500> the<00:03:50.560> stereo<00:03:50.980> image<00:03:51.250> so<00:03:51.880> I'm

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:51.970 
better sense of the stereo image so I'm

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:54.090 
better sense of the stereo image so I'm
recording<00:03:52.329> using<00:03:52.870> the<00:03:53.110> mid<00:03:53.290> side<00:03:53.560> technique

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:54.100 
recording using the mid side technique

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:56.280 
recording using the mid side technique
as<00:03:54.250> RAW<00:03:54.700> files<00:03:55.000> and<00:03:55.390> I'm<00:03:55.690> not<00:03:55.870> making<00:03:55.989> any

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:56.290 
as RAW files and I'm not making any

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:58.590 
as RAW files and I'm not making any
changes<00:03:56.739> while<00:03:57.010> I<00:03:57.040> record<00:03:57.670> but<00:03:58.060> as<00:03:58.150> I<00:03:58.239> play<00:03:58.450> the

00:03:58.590 --> 00:03:58.600 
changes while I record but as I play the

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:00.780 
changes while I record but as I play the
files<00:03:58.810> back<00:03:59.110> I'm<00:03:59.410> gradually<00:04:00.130> increasing<00:04:00.760> the

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:00.790 
files back I'm gradually increasing the

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:02.789 
files back I'm gradually increasing the
level<00:04:01.090> of<00:04:01.150> the<00:04:01.299> side<00:04:01.570> recording<00:04:02.230> and<00:04:02.380> as<00:04:02.620> I<00:04:02.739> do

00:04:02.789 --> 00:04:02.799 
level of the side recording and as I do

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:05.009 
level of the side recording and as I do
that<00:04:03.310> you'll<00:04:03.730> be<00:04:03.790> getting<00:04:03.970> more<00:04:04.450> ambient

00:04:05.009 --> 00:04:05.019 
that you'll be getting more ambient

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:06.509 
that you'll be getting more ambient
sound<00:04:05.260> in<00:04:05.440> the<00:04:05.530> mix<00:04:05.680> and<00:04:05.920> you'll<00:04:06.040> also<00:04:06.190> get<00:04:06.459> a

00:04:06.509 --> 00:04:06.519 
sound in the mix and you'll also get a

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:08.910 
sound in the mix and you'll also get a
wider<00:04:06.880> stereo<00:04:07.390> image<00:04:07.900> you'll<00:04:08.320> also<00:04:08.500> note<00:04:08.890> that

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:08.920 
wider stereo image you'll also note that

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:11.130 
wider stereo image you'll also note that
I've<00:04:09.130> got<00:04:09.250> a<00:04:09.280> foam<00:04:09.579> windscreen<00:04:10.000> on<00:04:10.269> the<00:04:10.450> h2n<00:04:10.959> as

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:11.140 
I've got a foam windscreen on the h2n as

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:12.990 
I've got a foam windscreen on the h2n as
well<00:04:11.350> that<00:04:11.799> really<00:04:12.130> helps<00:04:12.400> me<00:04:12.430> cut<00:04:12.670> down<00:04:12.700> on

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:13.000 
well that really helps me cut down on

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.610 
well that really helps me cut down on
wind<00:04:13.209> noise<00:04:13.360> it's<00:04:13.870> great<00:04:14.350> when<00:04:14.530> you're

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:14.620 
wind noise it's great when you're

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:16.199 
wind noise it's great when you're
shooting<00:04:14.890> outside<00:04:15.040> we'll<00:04:15.670> talk<00:04:15.850> a<00:04:15.880> little<00:04:16.060> bit

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:16.209 
shooting outside we'll talk a little bit

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:18.210 
shooting outside we'll talk a little bit
more<00:04:16.479> about<00:04:16.690> that<00:04:16.750> later<00:04:16.959> now<00:04:17.440> at<00:04:17.799> this<00:04:17.919> point

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:18.220 
more about that later now at this point

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:20.670 
more about that later now at this point
the<00:04:18.700> side<00:04:19.000> level<00:04:19.450> is<00:04:19.570> at<00:04:19.690> its<00:04:19.840> loudest<00:04:20.019> volume

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:20.680 
the side level is at its loudest volume

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:22.350 
the side level is at its loudest volume
and<00:04:20.799> that's<00:04:20.919> giving<00:04:21.190> me<00:04:21.220> the<00:04:21.430> maximum<00:04:21.700> stereo

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:22.360 
and that's giving me the maximum stereo

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:25.020 
and that's giving me the maximum stereo
image<00:04:22.780> and<00:04:22.990> stereo<00:04:23.530> width<00:04:23.800> and<00:04:24.039> more<00:04:24.520> ambient

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:25.030 
image and stereo width and more ambient

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:27.420 
image and stereo width and more ambient
sound<00:04:25.270> in<00:04:25.510> my<00:04:25.780> ms<00:04:26.169> technique<00:04:26.650> now<00:04:27.250> I've

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:27.430 
sound in my ms technique now I've

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:29.310 
sound in my ms technique now I've
emphasized<00:04:27.910> the<00:04:28.180> mid<00:04:28.419> side<00:04:28.660> pattern<00:04:29.110> because

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:29.320 
emphasized the mid side pattern because

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:31.290 
emphasized the mid side pattern because
it's<00:04:29.470> an<00:04:29.560> exciting<00:04:30.160> new<00:04:30.310> feature<00:04:30.520> but<00:04:30.880> as<00:04:31.270> I
