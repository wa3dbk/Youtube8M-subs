because<00:00:23.130> this<00:00:23.369> game<00:00:23.519> is<00:00:23.580> already<00:00:24.119> difficult

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
because this game is already difficult

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:25.910 
because this game is already difficult
the<00:00:24.869> way<00:00:24.960> it<00:00:25.019> is<00:00:25.140> and<00:00:25.260> it's<00:00:25.380> already<00:00:25.619> starting

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
the way it is and it's already starting

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.189 
the way it is and it's already starting
me<00:00:26.039> where<00:00:26.430> I<00:00:26.460> was<00:00:26.730> left<00:00:27.150> off<00:00:27.420> at<00:00:27.660> and<00:00:27.869> that<00:00:28.019> is

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
me where I was left off at and that is

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:29.900 
me where I was left off at and that is
level<00:00:28.619> 4<00:00:28.830> so<00:00:29.010> you<00:00:29.070> knew<00:00:29.220> progress<00:00:29.609> throughout

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
level 4 so you knew progress throughout

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.160 
level 4 so you knew progress throughout
the<00:00:30.090> game<00:00:30.240> you're<00:00:30.720> going<00:00:30.810> to<00:00:30.869> get<00:00:30.990> two

pictures<00:00:31.380> side<00:00:31.679> by<00:00:31.740> side<00:00:32.130> you've<00:00:32.309> got<00:00:32.340> your

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
pictures side by side you've got your

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.040 
pictures side by side you've got your
timer<00:00:32.790> at<00:00:32.940> the<00:00:33.059> top<00:00:33.270> that's<00:00:33.480> why<00:00:33.660> I'm<00:00:33.750> kind<00:00:33.960> of

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
timer at the top that's why I'm kind of

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.750 
timer at the top that's why I'm kind of
talking<00:00:34.230> a<00:00:34.380> little<00:00:34.440> bit<00:00:34.559> fast<00:00:34.890> here<00:00:35.130> so<00:00:35.610> that<00:00:35.730> I

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
talking a little bit fast here so that I

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.729 
talking a little bit fast here so that I
could<00:00:35.850> speed<00:00:36.210> through<00:00:36.420> this<00:00:36.600> and<00:00:36.840> trying<00:00:37.620> to

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
could speed through this and trying to

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.410 
could speed through this and trying to
spot<00:00:37.950> some<00:00:38.129> differences<00:00:38.610> so<00:00:38.850> I<00:00:38.879> don't<00:00:39.180> even

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
spot some differences so I don't even

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.030 
spot some differences so I don't even
see<00:00:39.629> any<00:00:39.660> and<00:00:40.020> this<00:00:40.170> is<00:00:40.260> getting<00:00:40.530> pretty

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
see any and this is getting pretty

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.440 
see any and this is getting pretty
difficult<00:00:41.309> here<00:00:41.670> so<00:00:41.820> I've<00:00:41.879> got<00:00:42.030> to<00:00:42.059> spot<00:00:42.329> the

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
difficult here so I've got to spot the

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.060 
difficult here so I've got to spot the
difference<00:00:42.750> differences<00:00:43.559> between<00:00:43.739> these

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
difference differences between these

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.459

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.190 
a very simple and well-known concept but
it's<00:01:26.280> just<00:01:26.400> very<00:01:26.520> fun<00:01:26.909> I<00:01:27.119> like<00:01:27.570> the<00:01:27.750> game<00:01:27.960> it's

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
it's just very fun I like the game it's

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.929 
it's just very fun I like the game it's
got<00:01:28.320> a<00:01:28.350> very<00:01:28.500> nice<00:01:28.710> soundtrack<00:01:29.100> I<00:01:29.250> think<00:01:29.700> I<00:01:29.759> see

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
got a very nice soundtrack I think I see

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.240 
got a very nice soundtrack I think I see
this<00:01:30.090> one<00:01:30.270> here<00:01:30.799> it's<00:01:31.799> a<00:01:31.890> little<00:01:32.100> bit

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
this one here it's a little bit

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.890 
this one here it's a little bit
different<00:01:32.640> the<00:01:32.820> placement<00:01:35.090> and<00:01:36.090> I<00:01:36.329> got<00:01:36.540> it<00:01:36.750> and

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
different the placement and I got it and

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.679 
different the placement and I got it and
if<00:01:37.530> you<00:01:37.619> click<00:01:37.799> on<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:38.009> wrong<00:01:38.159> spot<00:01:38.490> like<00:01:39.479> that

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
if you click on the wrong spot like that

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.300 
if you click on the wrong spot like that
you're<00:01:39.900> going<00:01:40.020> to<00:01:40.079> get<00:01:40.140> minus<00:01:40.470> 15<00:01:40.860> seconds

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
you're going to get minus 15 seconds

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:42.590 
you're going to get minus 15 seconds
you've<00:01:41.400> got<00:01:41.520> your<00:01:41.670> timer<00:01:41.880> again<00:01:42.060> at<00:01:42.299> the<00:01:42.390> top

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
you've got your timer again at the top

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:43.940 
you've got your timer again at the top
I'm<00:01:43.020> just<00:01:43.200> going<00:01:43.380> to<00:01:43.409> go<00:01:43.470> ahead<00:01:43.560> and<00:01:43.710> use<00:01:43.799> some

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
I'm just going to go ahead and use some

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.920 
I'm just going to go ahead and use some
more<00:01:44.040> hints<00:01:44.340> here<00:01:44.610> there's<00:01:45.210> one<00:01:45.390> of<00:01:45.689> them<00:01:45.780> that

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
more hints here there's one of them that

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.679 
more hints here there's one of them that
was<00:01:46.049> different<00:01:46.259> right<00:01:46.439> there<00:01:46.740> slightly<00:01:47.040> by

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:47.689 
was different right there slightly by

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:50.389 
was different right there slightly by
very<00:01:48.689> little<00:01:49.200> space<00:01:49.470> right<00:01:49.680> there<00:01:49.979> it

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
very little space right there it

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.039 
very little space right there it
basically<00:01:50.909> added<00:01:51.240> a<00:01:51.299> couple<00:01:51.420> more<00:01:51.600> windows<00:01:51.960> at

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
basically added a couple more windows at

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:53.389 
basically added a couple more windows at
the<00:01:52.079> top<00:01:52.320> of<00:01:52.350> that<00:01:52.649> place<00:01:52.860> I<00:01:53.009> think<00:01:53.040> are<00:01:53.369> a

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
the top of that place I think are a

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:56.600 
the top of that place I think are a
little<00:01:53.640> bit<00:01:53.820> more<00:01:54.210> of<00:01:54.360> a<00:01:55.070> just<00:01:56.070> doubled<00:01:56.490> it

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
little bit more of a just doubled it

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.069 
little bit more of a just doubled it
let's<00:01:57.450> add<00:01:57.600> another<00:01:57.630> one<00:01:58.369> and<00:01:59.600> the<00:02:00.600> sign<00:02:00.840> was

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
let's add another one and the sign was

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.050 
let's add another one and the sign was
different<00:02:01.530> it<00:02:01.590> looks<00:02:01.619> like<00:02:01.950> they're<00:02:02.189> so<00:02:02.820> we're

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
different it looks like they're so we're

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.789 
different it looks like they're so we're
on<00:02:03.149> to<00:02:03.329> the<00:02:03.450> next<00:02:03.630> level<00:02:03.899> we<00:02:03.990> got<00:02:04.140> another<00:02:04.500> hint

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
on to the next level we got another hint

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.010 
on to the next level we got another hint
after<00:02:04.920> every<00:02:05.310> single<00:02:05.670> level<00:02:05.820> you<00:02:06.659> kind<00:02:06.869> of<00:02:06.930> get

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
after every single level you kind of get

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.449 
after every single level you kind of get
