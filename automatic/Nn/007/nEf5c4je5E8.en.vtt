do<00:00:48.660> you<00:00:48.719> recommend<00:00:49.350> for<00:00:49.410> a<00:00:49.649> power<00:00:49.950> lifter<00:00:50.370> at

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
do you recommend for a power lifter at

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.160 
do you recommend for a power lifter at
this<00:00:50.640> or<00:00:50.820> that<00:00:50.969> point<00:00:51.329> well<00:00:51.660> here's<00:00:52.079> the

subscribers you're going to go get on
that<00:01:23.490> program<00:01:23.850> and<00:01:24.299> they're<00:01:24.840> not<00:01:24.990> going<00:01:25.110> to

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
that program and they're not going to

experiment with the other ones and when

experiment with the other ones and when
that<00:01:27.420> program<00:01:27.810> isn't<00:01:28.020> working<00:01:28.170> ideally

that program isn't working ideally

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.200 
that program isn't working ideally
because<00:01:29.009> some<00:01:29.189> of<00:01:29.220> these<00:01:29.369> programs<00:01:29.640> only

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
because some of these programs only

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.850 
because some of these programs only
really<00:01:30.509> work<00:01:30.720> for<00:01:30.750> six<00:01:31.170> to<00:01:31.290> eight<00:01:31.350> weeks<00:01:31.439> and

really work for six to eight weeks and

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.219 
really work for six to eight weeks and
then<00:01:32.009> you<00:01:32.100> go<00:01:32.280> to<00:01:32.340> something<00:01:32.640> else<00:01:32.970> or<00:01:33.960> you'll

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
then you go to something else or you'll

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.219 
then you go to something else or you'll
tend<00:01:34.500> to<00:01:34.590> stagnate<00:01:35.130> or<00:01:35.630> 12<00:01:36.630> weeks<00:01:36.869> or<00:01:37.079> whatever

for at least four intermediates because

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.450 
for at least four intermediates because
honestly<00:01:40.560> if<00:01:40.650> your<00:01:40.799> novice<00:01:41.189> you<00:01:41.310> should

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
honestly if your novice you should

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.370 
honestly if your novice you should
probably<00:01:41.729> stay<00:01:41.909> on<00:01:42.090> the<00:01:42.299> the<00:01:42.659> same<00:01:42.990> program

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
probably stay on the the same program

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.270 
probably stay on the the same program
for<00:01:43.500> about<00:01:43.680> a<00:01:43.710> year<00:01:44.040> build<00:01:44.579> a<00:01:44.729> base<00:01:44.930> but

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:46.280 
for about a year build a base but

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.800 
for about a year build a base but
they'll<00:01:47.280> stay<00:01:47.579> on<00:01:47.759> these<00:01:47.880> programs<00:01:48.450> and<00:01:48.689> then

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
they'll stay on these programs and then

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.179 
they'll stay on these programs and then
they<00:01:48.930> won't<00:01:49.079> change<00:01:49.470> to<00:01:49.710> something<00:01:49.920> that's

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
they won't change to something that's

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.580 
they won't change to something that's
better<00:01:50.520> for<00:01:50.880> them<00:01:51.270> maybe<00:01:51.630> because<00:01:51.899> I<00:01:52.259> gave

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
better for them maybe because I gave

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.429 
better for them maybe because I gave
that<00:01:52.770> advice<00:01:53.130> and<00:01:53.869> then<00:01:54.869> they're<00:01:55.170> going<00:01:55.320> to

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
that advice and then they're going to

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:56.840 
that advice and then they're going to
install<00:01:55.770> in<00:01:55.979> their<00:01:56.100> progress<00:01:56.490> or<00:01:56.729> they're

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
install in their progress or they're

00:01:59.499 --> 00:01:59.509 
going to blame me for giving that advice

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:01.850 
going to blame me for giving that advice
because<00:02:00.509> I<00:02:00.840> probably<00:02:01.079> did<00:02:01.469> give<00:02:01.649> bad<00:02:01.829> advice

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
because I probably did give bad advice

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.330 
because I probably did give bad advice
by<00:02:02.340> just<00:02:02.549> suggesting<00:02:03.060> one<00:02:03.240> now<00:02:04.310> there<00:02:05.310> are

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
by just suggesting one now there are

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.069 
by just suggesting one now there are
programs<00:02:05.759> out<00:02:06.180> there<00:02:06.420> that<00:02:06.450> I<00:02:06.600> don't<00:02:06.840> think

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
programs out there that I don't think

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:10.550 
programs out there that I don't think
are<00:02:07.259> very<00:02:08.220> good<00:02:08.640> for<00:02:09.539> guys<00:02:09.750> who<00:02:09.780> aren't<00:02:10.349> on<00:02:10.500> a

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
are very good for guys who aren't on a

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.440 
are very good for guys who aren't on a
hefty<00:02:10.890> amount<00:02:11.160> of<00:02:11.250> gear<00:02:11.459> and<00:02:11.670> that's<00:02:12.180> any

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
hefty amount of gear and that's any

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.290 
hefty amount of gear and that's any
program<00:02:12.989> that

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
program that

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.050 
program that
as<00:02:13.420> you<00:02:13.750> say<00:02:14.650> squatting<00:02:15.190> at<00:02:15.280> a<00:02:15.340> very<00:02:15.610> very<00:02:15.910> low

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
as you say squatting at a very very low

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.840 
as you say squatting at a very very low
frequency<00:02:16.840> if<00:02:17.200> you're<00:02:18.160> not<00:02:18.280> squatting<00:02:18.640> at

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:18.850 
frequency if you're not squatting at

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:20.910 
frequency if you're not squatting at
least<00:02:19.030> twice<00:02:19.240> a<00:02:19.300> week<00:02:19.660> that's<00:02:19.900> probably<00:02:20.380> not

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
least twice a week that's probably not

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.590 
least twice a week that's probably not
ideal<00:02:21.310> and<00:02:21.520> even<00:02:21.760> guys<00:02:21.910> you're<00:02:22.120> doing<00:02:22.420> the<00:02:22.510> low

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:22.600 
ideal and even guys you're doing the low

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:25.470 
ideal and even guys you're doing the low
frequency<00:02:23.170> ones<00:02:23.410> I<00:02:23.680> I<00:02:23.980> don't<00:02:24.820> think<00:02:25.210> that<00:02:25.390> if

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
frequency ones I I don't think that if

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.110 
frequency ones I I don't think that if
you're<00:02:25.600> on<00:02:25.720> a<00:02:25.750> grammar<00:02:26.080> lesson<00:02:26.230> here<00:02:27.120> you

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
you're on a grammar lesson here you

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:29.340 
you're on a grammar lesson here you
should<00:02:28.300> be<00:02:28.390> doing<00:02:28.510> a<00:02:28.720> program<00:02:28.930> like<00:02:29.140> that

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:29.350 
should be doing a program like that

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:32.360 
should be doing a program like that
unless<00:02:29.650> you're<00:02:29.860> just<00:02:29.920> so<00:02:30.430> strong<00:02:31.150> already

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
unless you're just so strong already

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.800 
unless you're just so strong already
that<00:02:33.370> you<00:02:33.550> need<00:02:33.760> that<00:02:33.910> for<00:02:33.970> recovery<00:02:34.600> purposes

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
that you need that for recovery purposes

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:36.540 
that you need that for recovery purposes
and<00:02:35.230> then<00:02:35.350> the<00:02:35.470> drugs<00:02:35.710> will<00:02:35.920> help<00:02:35.950> keep<00:02:36.340> the

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:36.550 
and then the drugs will help keep the

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:39.510 
and then the drugs will help keep the
neural<00:02:37.030> efficiency<00:02:37.540> up<00:02:37.660> so<00:02:38.320> I<00:02:38.680> don't<00:02:39.220> like<00:02:39.400> to

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:39.520 
neural efficiency up so I don't like to

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:40.920 
neural efficiency up so I don't like to
recommend<00:02:39.910> those<00:02:40.060> type<00:02:40.270> of<00:02:40.300> programs<00:02:40.840> that

stick<00:03:33.040> to<00:03:33.070> something<00:03:33.370> more<00:03:33.670> basic<00:03:33.840> instead<00:03:34.840> of

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:34.930 
stick to something more basic instead of

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:36.600 
stick to something more basic instead of
some<00:03:35.080> of<00:03:35.170> these<00:03:35.260> Russians<00:03:35.709> wat<00:03:35.920> programs<00:03:36.370> but

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:36.610 
some of these Russians wat programs but

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:38.160 
some of these Russians wat programs but
there<00:03:36.790> are<00:03:36.940> a<00:03:36.970> lot<00:03:37.239> of<00:03:37.270> really<00:03:37.630> good<00:03:37.750> Russian

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:38.170 
there are a lot of really good Russian

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:39.900 
there are a lot of really good Russian
programs<00:03:38.530> out<00:03:38.739> there<00:03:38.920> also<00:03:39.280> there's<00:03:39.520> just<00:03:39.730> so

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:39.910 
programs out there also there's just so

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:41.790 
programs out there also there's just so
many<00:03:40.030> options<00:03:40.330> available<00:03:40.870> to<00:03:41.140> you<00:03:41.440> they<00:03:41.590> all

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:41.800 
many options available to you they all

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:45.210 
many options available to you they all
work<00:03:42.190> I<00:03:42.720> would<00:03:43.720> say<00:03:43.840> with<00:03:43.959> most<00:03:44.590> power<00:03:44.860> lifters

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:45.220 
work I would say with most power lifters

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:47.100 
work I would say with most power lifters
try<00:03:45.489> some<00:03:45.760> of<00:03:45.790> the<00:03:45.910> more<00:03:46.060> popular<00:03:46.239> programs<00:03:46.930> if

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:47.110 
try some of the more popular programs if

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:48.210 
try some of the more popular programs if
they<00:03:47.230> seem<00:03:47.440> appropriate<00:03:47.770> for<00:03:48.130> your

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:48.220 
they seem appropriate for your

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:50.400 
they seem appropriate for your
experience<00:03:48.730> level<00:03:48.900> run<00:03:49.900> them<00:03:50.020> for<00:03:50.200> two<00:03:50.290> or

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:50.410 
experience level run them for two or

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:53.040 
experience level run them for two or
three<00:03:50.560> months<00:03:50.590> see<00:03:51.459> how<00:03:51.640> you<00:03:51.700> get<00:03:52.000> on<00:03:52.060> and<00:03:52.540> if

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:53.050 
three months see how you get on and if

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:54.900 
three months see how you get on and if
you<00:03:53.140> get<00:03:53.320> really<00:03:53.590> good<00:03:53.770> results<00:03:53.920> save<00:03:54.880> that

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:54.910 
you get really good results save that

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:56.280 
you get really good results save that
program<00:03:55.540> for<00:03:55.750> later<00:03:55.930> because<00:03:56.140> you're

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:56.290 
program for later because you're

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:57.330 
program for later because you're
probably<00:03:56.500> going<00:03:56.739> to<00:03:56.800> run<00:03:56.920> a<00:03:56.980> different

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:57.340 
probably going to run a different

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:59.570 
probably going to run a different
program<00:03:57.550> for<00:03:57.940> another<00:03:58.239> two<00:03:58.930> to<00:03:59.050> three<00:03:59.230> months

00:03:59.570 --> 00:03:59.580 
program for another two to three months

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:02.100 
program for another two to three months
maybe<00:04:00.580> every<00:04:00.940> three<00:04:00.970> months<00:04:01.510> you<00:04:01.690> switch

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:02.110 
maybe every three months you switch

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:04.350 
maybe every three months you switch
programs<00:04:02.620> around<00:04:02.770> but<00:04:03.130> keep<00:04:03.430> a<00:04:03.670> hold<00:04:04.060> of<00:04:04.270> the

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:04.360 
programs around but keep a hold of the

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:06.150 
programs around but keep a hold of the
ones<00:04:04.600> that<00:04:04.720> give<00:04:04.959> you<00:04:05.140> good<00:04:05.410> progress<00:04:05.770> make

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:06.160 
ones that give you good progress make

they all work and you're going to get

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:43.939 
they all work and you're going to get
out<00:04:42.600> of<00:04:42.630> them<00:04:42.870> which<00:04:43.050> you<00:04:43.169> put<00:04:43.350> into<00:04:43.500> it<00:04:43.650> if<00:04:43.830> you

out of them which you put into it if you

out of them which you put into it if you

train hard follow any of the proven
programs<00:04:45.990> correctly<00:04:46.560> you<00:04:46.710> eat<00:04:46.949> correctly

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:47.310 
programs correctly you eat correctly

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:49.460 
programs correctly you eat correctly
rest<00:04:47.790> correctly<00:04:48.270> you're<00:04:48.990> going<00:04:49.199> to<00:04:49.260> get<00:04:49.350> a<00:04:49.410> lot

rest correctly you're going to get a lot

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:52.100 
rest correctly you're going to get a lot
stronger<00:04:50.360> that's<00:04:51.360> really<00:04:51.780> what<00:04:51.900> it<00:04:51.990> comes

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:52.110 
stronger that's really what it comes

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:54.080 
stronger that's really what it comes
down<00:04:52.260> to<00:04:52.620> so<00:04:52.830> no<00:04:53.070> I<00:04:53.100> don't<00:04:53.460> like<00:04:53.550> to<00:04:53.729> suggest

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:54.090 
down to so no I don't like to suggest

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:56.900 
down to so no I don't like to suggest
specific<00:04:55.050> programs<00:04:55.620> because<00:04:56.460> of<00:04:56.610> the<00:04:56.699> fact

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:56.910 
specific programs because of the fact

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:58.969 
specific programs because of the fact
that<00:04:57.060> I<00:04:57.150> might<00:04:57.449> be<00:04:57.570> holding<00:04:57.900> people<00:04:58.320> back<00:04:58.350> by

00:04:58.969 --> 00:04:58.979 
that I might be holding people back by

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:01.310 
that I might be holding people back by
them<00:04:59.250> thinking<00:04:59.610> wealth<00:04:59.850> Jason<00:05:00.449> endorses<00:05:00.960> it<00:05:00.990> I

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:01.320 
them thinking wealth Jason endorses it I

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:04.250 
them thinking wealth Jason endorses it I
love<00:05:02.070> Jason's<00:05:02.520> work<00:05:02.699> maybe<00:05:02.970> it's<00:05:03.840> the<00:05:04.050> best

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:04.260 
love Jason's work maybe it's the best

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:07.100 
love Jason's work maybe it's the best
program<00:05:04.680> for<00:05:04.710> me<00:05:05.070> and<00:05:05.310> they<00:05:05.850> might<00:05:06.110> keep

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:07.110 
program for me and they might keep

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:08.570 
program for me and they might keep
running<00:05:07.440> it<00:05:07.530> over<00:05:07.650> and<00:05:07.889> over<00:05:08.010> and<00:05:08.250> it's<00:05:08.400> not

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:08.580 
running it over and over and it's not

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:10.310 
running it over and over and it's not
the<00:05:08.729> best<00:05:08.850> program<00:05:09.300> for<00:05:09.330> them<00:05:09.570> so<00:05:09.810> that's<00:05:10.169> why

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:10.320 
the best program for them so that's why

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:11.930 
the best program for them so that's why
I<00:05:10.350> don't<00:05:10.560> like<00:05:10.680> to<00:05:10.800> do<00:05:10.919> that<00:05:11.070> all<00:05:11.699> right<00:05:11.820> guys

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:11.940 
I don't like to do that all right guys
