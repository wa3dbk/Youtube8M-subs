00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
out did the running and I just seemed

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.439 
out did the running and I just seemed
like<00:00:22.560> he<00:00:22.800> flipped<00:00:23.130> a<00:00:23.250> little<00:00:23.490> little<00:00:24.029> over<00:00:24.330> the

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
like he flipped a little little over the

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.179 
like he flipped a little little over the
top<00:00:24.480> since<00:00:25.050> all<00:00:25.230> really<00:00:25.500> job<00:00:25.680> you<00:00:25.830> did<00:00:26.039> was

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
top since all really job you did was

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.089 
top since all really job you did was
slap<00:00:26.430> him<00:00:26.640> once<00:00:26.880> seemed<00:00:27.660> like<00:00:28.010> you<00:00:29.010> know

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
slap him once seemed like you know

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.099 
slap him once seemed like you know
seemed<00:00:29.699> a<00:00:29.789> little<00:00:29.910> overboard<00:00:30.420> Batista<00:00:30.929> went

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
seemed a little overboard Batista went

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:32.299 
seemed a little overboard Batista went
but<00:00:31.230> I<00:00:31.260> guess<00:00:31.410> that<00:00:31.560> was<00:00:31.650> the<00:00:31.710> whole<00:00:31.920> point<00:00:32.219> of

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
but I guess that was the whole point of

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.040 
but I guess that was the whole point of
the<00:00:32.399> story<00:00:32.579> line<00:00:32.850> Triple<00:00:33.210> H<00:00:33.300> then<00:00:33.540> told<00:00:33.840> the

about<00:01:01.469> Batista<00:01:02.129> except<00:01:02.460> you<00:01:02.609> know<00:01:02.699> you<00:01:03.090> got

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
about Batista except you know you got

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.080 
about Batista except you know you got
the<00:01:03.300> few<00:01:03.539> but<00:01:03.949> having<00:01:04.949> them<00:01:05.040> win<00:01:05.250> I<00:01:05.489> think

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
the few but having them win I think

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.550 
the few but having them win I think
really<00:01:06.270> turned<00:01:06.540> the<00:01:06.630> fans<00:01:06.900> against<00:01:07.380> him

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
really turned the fans against him

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.590 
really turned the fans against him
because<00:01:08.040> I<00:01:08.400> guess<00:01:08.580> everyone<00:01:08.909> expected<00:01:09.330> Daniel

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
because I guess everyone expected Daniel

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.289 
because I guess everyone expected Daniel
Bryan<00:01:09.840> a<00:01:09.960> win<00:01:10.110> so<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.580> only<00:01:11.729> way<00:01:11.880> I<00:01:11.909> think<00:01:12.090> to

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
Bryan a win so the only way I think to

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.780 
Bryan a win so the only way I think to
make<00:01:12.540> people<00:01:12.990> happy<00:01:13.590> is<00:01:13.619> to<00:01:14.189> put<00:01:14.400> Daniel<00:01:14.729> Bryan

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
make people happy is to put Daniel Bryan

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.550 
make people happy is to put Daniel Bryan
in<00:01:15.119> the<00:01:15.150> title<00:01:15.570> match<00:01:15.780> but<00:01:16.110> then<00:01:16.290> it<00:01:16.409> really

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
in the title match but then it really

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.260 
in the title match but then it really
takes<00:01:16.860> away<00:01:17.009> from<00:01:17.189> the<00:01:17.369> whole<00:01:17.580> reason<00:01:17.729> patita

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
takes away from the whole reason patita

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.210 
takes away from the whole reason patita
