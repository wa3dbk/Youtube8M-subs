00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.000 
the pouch to do this and again if you

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.879 
the pouch to do this and again if you
want<00:03:40.030> to<00:03:40.239> change<00:03:40.480> applications<00:03:41.319> or<00:03:41.560> anything

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:41.889 
want to change applications or anything

00:03:41.889 --> 00:03:43.979 
want to change applications or anything
else<00:03:42.040> you're<00:03:42.730> going<00:03:42.970> to<00:03:43.060> need<00:03:43.239> to<00:03:43.480> take<00:03:43.510> it<00:03:43.840> out

00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:43.989 
else you're going to need to take it out

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:46.020 
else you're going to need to take it out
of<00:03:44.019> the<00:03:44.440> case<00:03:44.620> while<00:03:45.400> this<00:03:45.519> is<00:03:45.639> relatively

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.030 
of the case while this is relatively

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:48.000 
of the case while this is relatively
easy<00:03:46.269> doing<00:03:47.139> it<00:03:47.230> more<00:03:47.319> than<00:03:47.470> a<00:03:47.560> few<00:03:47.739> times

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.010 
easy doing it more than a few times

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:49.680 
easy doing it more than a few times
pulling<00:03:48.519> it<00:03:48.639> out<00:03:48.730> putting<00:03:49.000> it<00:03:49.120> back<00:03:49.209> in<00:03:49.540> again

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:49.690 
pulling it out putting it back in again

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:52.860 
pulling it out putting it back in again
is<00:03:50.019> extremely<00:03:50.849> irritating<00:03:51.849> and<00:03:52.030> aggravating

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:52.870 
is extremely irritating and aggravating

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:56.069 
is extremely irritating and aggravating
so<00:03:53.579> overall<00:03:54.579> I<00:03:54.910> would<00:03:55.030> say<00:03:55.269> this<00:03:55.599> center<00:03:55.870> pouch

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:56.079 
so overall I would say this center pouch

00:03:56.079 --> 00:03:57.960 
so overall I would say this center pouch
is<00:03:56.379> a<00:03:56.410> very<00:03:56.769> very<00:03:56.950> high<00:03:57.129> quality<00:03:57.310> case<00:03:57.700> I<00:03:57.940> think

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:57.970 
is a very very high quality case I think

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:59.819 
is a very very high quality case I think
it<00:03:58.269> should<00:03:58.389> be<00:03:58.450> highly<00:03:58.750> considered<00:03:59.290> if<00:03:59.650> you're

00:03:59.819 --> 00:03:59.829 
it should be highly considered if you're

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:01.140 
it should be highly considered if you're
looking<00:04:00.069> for<00:04:00.099> a<00:04:00.190> minimalistic<00:04:00.579> pouch<00:04:00.970> for

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:01.150 
looking for a minimalistic pouch for

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:03.300

your iphone 4 you know this case is made

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:05.069 
your iphone 4 you know this case is made
out<00:04:03.459> of<00:04:03.489> premium<00:04:04.299> leather<00:04:04.449> it's<00:04:04.750> the<00:04:04.840> best

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:05.079 
out of premium leather it's the best

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:08.550 
out of premium leather it's the best
quality<00:04:05.410> I've<00:04:05.769> seen<00:04:05.980> on<00:04:06.129> a<00:04:06.160> case<00:04:06.400> and<00:04:06.609> the<00:04:07.599> $29

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:08.560 
quality I've seen on a case and the $29

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:10.500 
quality I've seen on a case and the $29
no<00:04:08.680> time<00:04:08.859> for<00:04:09.010> this<00:04:09.220> quality<00:04:09.639> of<00:04:09.879> leather<00:04:10.209> i

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:10.510 
no time for this quality of leather i

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:12.479 
no time for this quality of leather i
think<00:04:10.900> is<00:04:10.989> an<00:04:11.079> absolute<00:04:11.440> steal<00:04:11.709> but<00:04:12.310> also

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:12.489 
think is an absolute steal but also

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:14.220 
think is an absolute steal but also
remember<00:04:13.030> you<00:04:13.120> know<00:04:13.239> must<00:04:13.510> bear<00:04:13.690> in<00:04:13.840> mind<00:04:14.019> that

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:14.230 
remember you know must bear in mind that

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:16.699 
remember you know must bear in mind that
it<00:04:15.129> does<00:04:15.459> have<00:04:15.489> limited<00:04:16.120> functionality

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:16.709 
it does have limited functionality

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:19.469 
it does have limited functionality
accessibility<00:04:17.709> wise<00:04:18.099> but<00:04:18.400> still<00:04:18.699> for<00:04:19.239> a<00:04:19.269> pouch

00:04:19.469 --> 00:04:19.479 
accessibility wise but still for a pouch

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:21.150 
accessibility wise but still for a pouch
one<00:04:20.109> of<00:04:20.229> the<00:04:20.289> best<00:04:20.470> I<00:04:20.650> would<00:04:20.709> definitely<00:04:20.919> say
