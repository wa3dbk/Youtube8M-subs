00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:45.600 
get them online getting it now is one
thing<00:00:43.780> but<00:00:43.989> saving<00:00:44.379> 30<00:00:44.589> bucks<00:00:44.830> to<00:00:45.100> potentially

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:45.610

buy different gears another thing so I

00:00:47.769 --> 00:00:50.220 
buy different gears another thing so I
