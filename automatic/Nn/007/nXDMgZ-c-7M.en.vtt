behind it this little tool here and you
might<00:00:46.230> say<00:00:46.469> well<00:00:46.920> what<00:00:47.129> the<00:00:47.250> heck<00:00:47.460> is<00:00:47.489> going<00:00:47.940> on

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
might say well what the heck is going on

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.630

see this disk cleanup tool that is

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.990 
see this disk cleanup tool that is
calculating<00:00:54.829> gathering<00:00:55.829> the<00:00:56.039> files<00:00:56.399> that<00:00:56.879> it

calculating gathering the files that it

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.290 
calculating gathering the files that it
wants<00:00:57.329> to<00:00:57.449> compress<00:00:57.930> now<00:00:58.739> depending<00:00:59.100> upon<00:00:59.550> how

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
wants to compress now depending upon how

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.470 
wants to compress now depending upon how
often<00:01:00.930> you<00:01:01.230> use<00:01:01.260> disk<00:01:02.010> cleanup<00:01:02.480> will

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
often you use disk cleanup will

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.100 
often you use disk cleanup will
determine<00:01:04.199> how<00:01:04.739> long<00:01:04.799> it<00:01:05.369> takes<00:01:05.729> this<00:01:06.720> step

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
determine how long it takes this step

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.460 
determine how long it takes this step
right<00:01:07.140> here<00:01:07.439> to<00:01:07.950> complete<00:01:08.460> it<00:01:09.299> could<00:01:09.689> take<00:01:09.990> two

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
right here to complete it could take two

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.030 
right here to complete it could take two
minutes<00:01:10.740> it<00:01:11.100> could<00:01:11.909> take<00:01:11.939> two<00:01:12.570> hours<00:01:13.020> i<00:01:13.290> have

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
minutes it could take two hours i have

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.370 
minutes it could take two hours i have
seen<00:01:14.340> computers<00:01:15.090> that<00:01:15.540> have<00:01:15.600> never<00:01:16.110> been

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
seen computers that have never been

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.539 
seen computers that have never been
cleaned<00:01:16.740> up<00:01:16.950> before<00:01:17.330> take<00:01:18.330> up<00:01:18.600> to<00:01:18.960> four<00:01:19.710> to<00:01:20.220> six

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
cleaned up before take up to four to six

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.690 
cleaned up before take up to four to six
hours<00:01:21.049> for<00:01:22.049> this<00:01:22.259> step<00:01:22.619> right<00:01:22.860> here<00:01:23.100> to

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
hours for this step right here to

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.670 
hours for this step right here to
complete<00:01:24.890> so<00:01:25.890> after<00:01:26.700> it<00:01:26.729> has<00:01:27.299> completed<00:01:27.680> you

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
complete so after it has completed you

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.590 
complete so after it has completed you
will<00:01:28.710> get<00:01:29.040> a<00:01:29.100> little<00:01:29.400> box<00:01:29.700> and<00:01:30.090> what<00:01:30.270> i<00:01:30.299> want

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
will get a little box and what i want

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.480 
will get a little box and what i want
you<00:01:30.689> to<00:01:30.780> do<00:01:30.930> then<00:01:31.140> is<00:01:31.320> to<00:01:31.470> go<00:01:31.680> through<00:01:31.979> and<00:01:32.189> make

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
you to do then is to go through and make

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.390 
you to do then is to go through and make
sure<00:01:32.820> each<00:01:33.450> of<00:01:33.780> the<00:01:33.900> little<00:01:34.049> tick<00:01:34.439> boxes<00:01:35.100> are

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
sure each of the little tick boxes are

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.330 
sure each of the little tick boxes are
checked<00:01:35.670> and<00:01:36.329> as<00:01:36.780> i<00:01:37.049> do<00:01:37.110> these<00:01:37.530> tick<00:01:37.799> boxes

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
checked and as i do these tick boxes

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.550 
checked and as i do these tick boxes
what<00:01:39.030> watch<00:01:39.299> that<00:01:39.600> number<00:01:39.990> under<00:01:40.259> total

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
what watch that number under total

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.580 
what watch that number under total
amount<00:01:41.009> of<00:01:41.100> disk<00:01:41.369> space<00:01:41.430> change<00:01:42.439> because<00:01:43.439> you

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
amount of disk space change because you

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.740 
amount of disk space change because you
want<00:01:43.860> everything<00:01:44.280> checked<00:01:44.909> and<00:01:45.119> believe<00:01:45.479> me

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
want everything checked and believe me

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.800 
want everything checked and believe me
you<00:01:45.780> will<00:01:46.259> not<00:01:46.500> miss<00:01:46.860> any<00:01:47.159> of<00:01:47.340> that<00:01:47.460> stuff

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 
you will not miss any of that stuff

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:49.910 
you will not miss any of that stuff
after<00:01:48.810> you've<00:01:48.930> got<00:01:49.079> everything<00:01:49.380> checked

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
after you've got everything checked

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.370 
after you've got everything checked
click<00:01:50.220> OK<00:01:50.820> and<00:01:51.030> then<00:01:51.119> the<00:01:51.840> disk<00:01:52.110> cleanup

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
click OK and then the disk cleanup

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.130 
click OK and then the disk cleanup
utility<00:01:52.560> will<00:01:53.310> start<00:01:53.610> doing<00:01:54.000> its<00:01:54.180> thing<00:01:54.450> which

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
utility will start doing its thing which

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.260 
utility will start doing its thing which
is<00:01:55.170> moving<00:01:55.770> stuff<00:01:56.070> and<00:01:56.369> compressing<00:01:57.000> really

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
is moving stuff and compressing really

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.190 
is moving stuff and compressing really
what<00:01:57.450> you're<00:01:57.600> doing<00:01:57.659> is<00:01:58.259> rewriting<00:01:58.860> over<00:01:59.579> a

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:00.200 
what you're doing is rewriting over a

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.670 
what you're doing is rewriting over a
certain<00:02:01.200> part<00:02:01.649> of<00:02:01.799> your<00:02:02.009> of<00:02:02.579> your<00:02:02.820> hard<00:02:03.030> drive

certain part of your of your hard drive
again<00:02:04.680> depending<00:02:05.189> upon<00:02:05.250> how<00:02:05.579> often<00:02:06.030> you<00:02:06.149> do

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
again depending upon how often you do

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.719 
again depending upon how often you do
this<00:02:06.600> will<00:02:06.840> determine<00:02:07.020> how<00:02:07.799> long<00:02:07.860> this<00:02:08.399> step

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
this will determine how long this step

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.510 
this will determine how long this step
we'll<00:02:09.030> take<00:02:09.300> it<00:02:09.539> could<00:02:09.840> take<00:02:10.110> up<00:02:10.379> to<00:02:10.410> four<00:02:11.310> to
