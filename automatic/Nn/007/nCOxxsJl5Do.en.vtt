00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:43.780 
better for me if I would allow my hair
to<00:03:40.520> completely<00:03:40.940> dry<00:03:41.360> also<00:03:42.080> I<00:03:42.350> think<00:03:42.860> next<00:03:43.430> time

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:43.790 
to completely dry also I think next time

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:46.600 
to completely dry also I think next time
I<00:03:44.000> will<00:03:44.360> incorporate<00:03:44.840> some<00:03:45.380> gel<00:03:45.770> because

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:46.610 
I will incorporate some gel because

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:49.060 
I will incorporate some gel because
although<00:03:47.030> my<00:03:47.420> hair<00:03:47.660> was<00:03:47.900> really<00:03:48.290> soft<00:03:48.650> and

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:49.070 
although my hair was really soft and

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:52.690 
although my hair was really soft and
bouncy<00:03:49.670> it<00:03:50.660> did<00:03:50.870> not<00:03:51.020> have<00:03:51.230> a<00:03:51.260> good<00:03:51.530> hold<00:03:51.800> we're

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:52.700 
bouncy it did not have a good hold we're

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:54.490 
bouncy it did not have a good hold we're
just<00:03:52.940> using<00:03:53.150> the<00:03:53.360> Shea<00:03:53.540> Moisture<00:03:53.600> products<00:03:54.410> so

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:54.500 
just using the Shea Moisture products so

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.110 
just using the Shea Moisture products so
I<00:03:54.530> think<00:03:54.770> I'm<00:03:54.860> gonna<00:03:55.010> use<00:03:55.280> some<00:03:55.310> eco<00:03:55.850> styler

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:56.120 
I think I'm gonna use some eco styler

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:40.870 
I think I'm gonna use some eco styler
gel<00:03:56.209> next<00:03:56.780> time

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:40.880 

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:43.760 

so<00:04:41.880> this<00:04:42.120> is<00:04:42.240> what<00:04:42.389> I<00:04:42.419> realized<00:04:42.900> that<00:04:43.380> I<00:04:43.440> should

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:43.770 
so this is what I realized that I should

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:45.800 
so this is what I realized that I should
stop<00:04:43.980> separating<00:04:44.250> because<00:04:45.150> I<00:04:45.389> was<00:04:45.570> getting<00:04:45.690> a

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:45.810 
stop separating because I was getting a

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:48.320 
stop separating because I was getting a
lot<00:04:45.930> of<00:04:46.050> frizz<00:04:46.320> and<00:04:47.040> being<00:04:47.790> that<00:04:47.940> my<00:04:48.030> hair<00:04:48.210> was

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:48.330 
lot of frizz and being that my hair was

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:51.320 
lot of frizz and being that my hair was
not<00:04:48.570> fully<00:04:48.780> dry<00:04:49.110> I<00:04:49.590> was<00:04:50.010> like<00:04:50.100> okay<00:04:50.460> I<00:04:50.730> know<00:04:51.180> how

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:51.330 
not fully dry I was like okay I know how

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:53.300 
not fully dry I was like okay I know how
this<00:04:51.360> is<00:04:51.630> gonna<00:04:51.690> turn<00:04:51.840> out<00:04:52.080> so<00:04:52.440> I<00:04:52.710> went<00:04:53.160> ahead

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:53.310 
this is gonna turn out so I went ahead

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:55.159

and<00:04:53.400> stopped<00:04:53.669> separating<00:04:54.330> and<00:04:54.600> here<00:04:54.870> are<00:04:55.020> the
