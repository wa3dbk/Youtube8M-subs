00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:21.710 
buttons I'm gonna replace a plunger in
and<00:00:14.429> it's<00:00:14.700> fairly<00:00:15.179> simple<00:00:17.840> let's<00:00:18.840> say<00:00:19.939> so<00:00:20.939> you

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
and it's fairly simple let's say so you

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.070 
and it's fairly simple let's say so you
could<00:00:21.900> zoom<00:00:21.930> then<00:00:22.410> you'll<00:00:23.310> see<00:00:23.900> this<00:00:24.900> little

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
could zoom then you'll see this little

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.990 
could zoom then you'll see this little
tab<00:00:25.350> right<00:00:25.619> here<00:00:25.650> and<00:00:26.039> there's<00:00:26.340> one<00:00:26.430> on<00:00:26.849> the

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
tab right here and there's one on the

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.410 
tab right here and there's one on the
opposite<00:00:27.420> side<00:00:27.680> and<00:00:28.680> I'm<00:00:28.830> taking<00:00:29.189> a<00:00:29.420> like

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
opposite side and I'm taking a like

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.120 
opposite side and I'm taking a like
eyeglass<00:00:30.869> screwdriver<00:00:31.410> and<00:00:31.830> you're<00:00:31.980> gonna

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
eyeglass screwdriver and you're gonna

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:39.500 
eyeglass screwdriver and you're gonna
push<00:00:32.579> it<00:00:32.730> in<00:00:32.790> a<00:00:32.850> little<00:00:32.910> bit<00:00:33.270> and<00:00:38.270> does<00:00:39.270> take<00:00:39.450> a

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
push it in a little bit and does take a

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:40.850 
push it in a little bit and does take a
little<00:00:39.600> bit<00:00:39.719> of<00:00:39.809> practice<00:00:40.290> you'll<00:00:40.469> get<00:00:40.620> to

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
little bit of practice you'll get to

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.290 
little bit of practice you'll get to
come<00:00:41.129> up<00:00:41.309> off<00:00:41.550> the<00:00:41.790> lens<00:00:42.620> and<00:00:43.820> then<00:00:44.820> it<00:00:45.059> just

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
come up off the lens and then it just

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.950 
come up off the lens and then it just
pops<00:00:45.510> right<00:00:45.660> out<00:00:45.780> and<00:00:46.079> then<00:00:46.200> inside<00:00:46.649> is<00:00:47.960> this

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
pops right out and then inside is this

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.860 
pops right out and then inside is this
is<00:00:49.170> actually<00:00:49.620> the<00:00:49.829> heart<00:00:50.550> of<00:00:50.730> it<00:00:50.850> the<00:00:51.059> micro

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
is actually the heart of it the micro

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.650 
is actually the heart of it the micro
switch<00:00:52.110> is<00:00:52.260> right<00:00:52.440> here<00:00:52.760> which<00:00:53.760> you<00:00:53.789> could<00:00:54.329> I

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
switch is right here which you could I

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.810 
switch is right here which you could I
think<00:00:54.809> you<00:00:55.140> can<00:00:55.289> take<00:00:55.440> this<00:00:55.649> out<00:00:55.829> too<00:00:56.129> but<00:00:56.550> I'm

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
think you can take this out too but I'm

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.450 
think you can take this out too but I'm
just<00:00:57.210> gonna<00:00:57.390> leave<00:00:57.570> it<00:00:57.600> the<00:00:57.750> way<00:00:57.780> it<00:00:57.899> is<00:00:58.140> so<00:00:59.129> I

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
just gonna leave it the way it is so I

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.450 
just gonna leave it the way it is so I
want<00:00:59.730> to<00:00:59.820> end<00:01:00.030> up<00:01:00.500> taking<00:01:01.500> the<00:01:01.710> different

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
want to end up taking the different

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.850 
want to end up taking the different
plunger<00:01:02.910> and<00:01:03.149> then<00:01:03.960> just<00:01:04.320> put<00:01:04.470> it<00:01:04.530> in<00:01:04.619> here

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
plunger and then just put it in here

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.100 
plunger and then just put it in here
they<00:01:05.070> can<00:01:05.250> only<00:01:05.519> go<00:01:05.670> in<00:01:05.700> one<00:01:05.880> way<00:01:06.060> so<00:01:07.189> once<00:01:08.189> you

up a little bit the reason why we wrote
down<00:03:40.890> these<00:03:41.280> colors<00:03:41.790> is<00:03:42.060> how<00:03:42.209> we<00:03:42.329> can

00:03:42.559 --> 00:03:42.569 
down these colors is how we can

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:46.970 
down these colors is how we can
correspond<00:03:43.319> to<00:03:43.590> the<00:03:43.950> correct<00:03:44.250> button<00:03:44.430> and<00:03:45.980> I'm

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980
