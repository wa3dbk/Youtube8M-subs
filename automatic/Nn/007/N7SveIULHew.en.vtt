00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.909
 what's up guys like they are 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.570
 no no 

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:15.050
 the earth sleeve form sos present 

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:17.180
 the argument that humans have 

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:20.150
 been able to send material 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:22.850
 biological to Mars with ground cinema 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:24.890
 form it is to modify the 

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:28.369
 planet to make it able to sustain 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:31.329
 life but it would be possible to modify the 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:35.270
 red planet to someday inhabit not 

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:37.070
 we can reform Mars this year and 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:40.100
 curiosity found evidence of water 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:42.620
 liquid on Mars this does not mean that 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:45.469
 be an oasis in the middle of the solar system 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:47.899
 the water is extremely salty 

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:51.500
 very cold and is trapped between layers of 

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:53.840
 mud under the rocky Martian soil still 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:55.940
 so this completes the perfect trinity 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.980
 for life as we know it in the 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:00.230
 land we know that running and 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:02.390
 nutrients in the soil a source of 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:05.210
 energy in the form of carbon monoxide 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:08.030
 for hungry microbes and water 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:09.590
 liquid the scientists who are behind 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:11.659
 of the discovery of water on Mars 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:14.520
 they believe that finding life in the 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:16.740
 red planet does not seem very likely yet 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.500
 and this is because it is simply 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.320
 very cold and very dry in most of the 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.390
 parts of the planet but certainly 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.789
 they think it's very possible to find 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.100
 environments probably connected to 

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:31.320
 these water tanks where life 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.930
 could prosper 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.060
 for Gary Kim a microbiologist from the 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.040
 university of louisiana who studies 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.170
 organisms that survive in environments 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.520
 this presents us with an 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.560
 incredible opportunity 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:47.079
 maybe we will never find microbes 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:49.899
 native Martians and they may have 

00:01:47.079 --> 00:01:51.369
 disappeared long ago but due to 

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:53.610
 that the red planet has the trio 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:56.439
 Perfect energy nutrients and water 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:59.450
 with this we could make life flourish 

00:01:56.439 --> 00:02:01.490
 microbial there ourselves 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.950
 according to whom the planting of colonies 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:06.289
 microbials specially cultivated 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:09.530
 to withstand the severe conditions of 

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:11.360
 Mars is not only possible but could 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:14.120
 serve as our first step to 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.920
 earth form the planet the 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.260
 transformation of our solar neighbor 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.090
 from a desolate land to an environment 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:22.130
 prosperous that could support the 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:25.430
 development of complex life forms 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:27.800
 and possibly one day it might even 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:30.140
 house human beings 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:32.120
 Although the idea sounds fanciful, it is believed 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:35.180
 that we could start doing it in the 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:37.490
 next 100 years the concept begins 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:40.040
 in small microorganisms consume 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:42.650
 the natural resources of Mars for not 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:44.510
 only transform the type of soil 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:46.730
 also so that the laughable mind 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:50.510
 thin atmosphere of Mars become more 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:52.880
 strong this is not simple theory has 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:55.580
 proven that this process works 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:57.170
 made on our same planet him 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:00.130
 we must the atmosphere is rich in oxygen 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:03.110
 to the microbes that made photosynthesis 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:05.270
 the purpose of sending bacteria and others 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:07.460
 microorganisms is to propitiate 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:09.740
 atmospheric changes that serve to 

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:11.780
 several purposes 

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:14.420
 at the beginning the greenhouse gases in 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:16.370
 the planet warming it and at the same 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:18.210
 time liquid water would be 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:20.010
 more available 

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:22.350
 long-term an atmosphere with 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:25.170
 different composition could be suitable 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:27.090
 for a wider range of life much more 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:29.630
 of what the atmosphere that Mars has 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:31.860
 at this time can sustain 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:33.780
 think of it as if they were a series of 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:35.670
 steps every generation of 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:38.130
 microorganisms could be to Mars more 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:40.260
 suitable for the next generation of 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:42.570
 life in a future humans 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:44.790
 colonizers of Mars would have not only 

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:47.100
 a habitable planet but also 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:49.980
 a sustainable and independent colony 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:51.690
 from the earth what is the see that mars 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:53.310
 presents an impressive challenge to the 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:55.620
 first generation of microbes 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:58.350
 colonizers the limited amount of 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:00.530
 super salty water the cold weather and the 

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:03.150
 little protection from cosmic radiation 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:06.069
 they make the decision that 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:09.010
 microbes to be difficult 

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:10.659
 but do not worry about it here 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:13.420
 we have found several microbes 

00:04:10.659 --> 00:04:15.249
 candidates here on earth the detail 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:17.440
 is that they are not fully prepared for 

00:04:15.249 --> 00:04:19.959
 endure all the challenges of the planet 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:22.150
 red so what we would have to do 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:24.130
 would be modified with engineering 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:26.320
 genetic to choose the traits 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:28.690
 specific things that they would need to live 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:30.970
 on Mars and this is the biggest neck of 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:32.500
 bottles of the project since not yet 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:34.599
 we had the knowledge and the 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:36.690
 technology needed to modify the 

00:04:34.599 --> 00:04:38.860
 microorganisms at our whim 

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:41.410
 fortunately the scientists wait 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:43.030
 that this be solved in a decade more 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:45.370
 or less 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:47.560
 but even if we could reform 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:50.980
 marte word barring it with microbes 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:54.010
 this will never be like the earth for two 

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:56.650
 reasons the first is that the severity of 

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:58.960
 Mars is 62 percent less than the 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:01.450
 the earth this is not a problem 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:03.310
 for future settlers only 

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:06.220
 it means that you can make mortals 

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:08.290
 backward easier the big problem 

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:11.030
 is that there is no way to return 

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:12.740
 Mars your magnetic field 

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:15.080
 we can make microbes 

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:17.720
 thrive but without the protective shield 

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:19.820
 that filter the cosmic radiation is 

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:22.340
 difficult to imagine life forms more 

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:24.920
 complex unless the 

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:27.020
 terrestrial microorganisms evolve to 

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:28.880
 over thousands of years in a way 

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:31.910
 of life that is capable of supporting 

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:33.500
 lethal amounts of radiation and 

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:36.230
 this way they become the species 

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:37.780
 dominant of the planet and then we have 

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:40.780
 have to fight with them to be able 

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:40.780
 recover it 

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:47.780
 I'm sure I 've heard something like that 

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:50.450
 nowhere 

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:52.280
 thank you very much for watching this chapter 

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:54.620
 the video you liked to share with your 

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:56.360
 friends and if you are not yet subscribed to 

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:57.620
 channel this is the best time to 

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:59.630
 do what 

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:02.540
 and another thing I would like to ask you 

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:04.820
 who of my audience lives in chihuahua 

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:06.500
 capital I would like to make a 

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:08.330
 coexistence with you but I need 

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:10.419
 know who can go and who 

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:14.210
 they would be willing to go so 

00:06:10.419 --> 00:06:18.710
 send me an email to this address 

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:20.120
 and I do not know what else to say just me 

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:22.550
 It remains to remind them that my name is 

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:25.599
 assembling mountain and as always 

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:25.599
 we will see in the future 

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:36.810
 and so fast before I go I would like to 

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:39.030
 take advantage to send it a 

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:41.699
 congratulations to demián martins years that 

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:45.330
 is turning 10 years old 

00:06:41.699 --> 00:06:47.699
 Martin demanded a speech a hug 

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:50.699
 and I hope you recover soon come over 

00:06:47.699 --> 00:06:52.849
 the very good very happy birthday and until 

00:06:50.699 --> 00:06:52.849
 then
