00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:02.929 

so<00:00:01.079> I<00:00:01.110> got<00:00:01.350> a<00:00:01.380> couple<00:00:01.589> of<00:00:01.770> questions<00:00:01.979> about<00:00:02.460> my

00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:02.939 
so I got a couple of questions about my

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:05.660 
so I got a couple of questions about my
modification<00:00:03.689> to<00:00:03.870> the<00:00:03.990> x32<00:00:04.500> oscillator<00:00:05.310> trick

it<00:01:18.450> doesn't<00:01:18.630> seem<00:01:19.110> to<00:01:19.229> have<00:01:19.409> any<00:01:19.650> way<00:01:19.890> to

it doesn't seem to have any way to

it doesn't seem to have any way to

select where the gate tapped it's a

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.859 
select where the gate tapped it's a
signal<00:01:22.290> from<00:01:22.500> so<00:01:23.310> we're<00:01:24.000> signaling<00:01:24.540> the<00:01:24.659> gate

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
signal from so we're signaling the gate

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.039 
signal from so we're signaling the gate
from<00:01:25.259> channel<00:01:25.619> 1<00:01:25.830> but<00:01:26.310> before<00:01:26.640> the<00:01:26.759> fader<00:01:27.049> now

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
from channel 1 but before the fader now

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.170 
from channel 1 but before the fader now
to<00:01:28.110> work<00:01:28.320> around<00:01:28.500> this<00:01:28.890> I'm<00:01:29.280> first<00:01:29.880> going<00:01:30.090> to

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
to work around this I'm first going to

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.149 
to work around this I'm first going to
remove<00:01:30.479> channel<00:01:30.900> 1<00:01:31.079> is<00:01:31.110> the<00:01:31.380> gates<00:01:31.560> key<00:01:31.860> source

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
remove channel 1 is the gates key source

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.960 
remove channel 1 is the gates key source
and<00:01:32.780> as<00:01:33.780> an<00:01:33.990> aside<00:01:34.290> I<00:01:34.650> also<00:01:34.950> like<00:01:35.520> to<00:01:35.670> move<00:01:35.820> it

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
and as an aside I also like to move it

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.550 
and as an aside I also like to move it
to<00:01:36.060> where<00:01:36.240> it<00:01:36.329> won't<00:01:36.450> be<00:01:36.630> using<00:01:36.900> a<00:01:36.960> low<00:01:37.140> channel

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
to where it won't be using a low channel

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.490 
to where it won't be using a low channel
number<00:01:37.860> so<00:01:38.549> I<00:01:38.579> put<00:01:38.909> it<00:01:39.000> on<00:01:39.060> channel<00:01:39.450> 32<00:01:39.750> instead

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
number so I put it on channel 32 instead

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.550 
number so I put it on channel 32 instead
of<00:01:40.619> channel<00:01:40.920> 2<00:01:41.810> next<00:01:42.810> I'll<00:01:42.899> introduce<00:01:43.140> a<00:01:43.439> new

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
of channel 2 next I'll introduce a new

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.580 
of channel 2 next I'll introduce a new
bus<00:01:43.799> bus<00:01:44.340> 9<00:01:44.610> and<00:01:45.000> send<00:01:45.750> the<00:01:45.869> kick<00:01:46.049> drum<00:01:46.290> to<00:01:46.320> it

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
bus bus 9 and send the kick drum to it

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.690 
bus bus 9 and send the kick drum to it
post<00:01:47.310> fader<00:01:47.579> and<00:01:48.799> finally<00:01:49.799> I<00:01:49.829> route<00:01:50.189> that<00:01:50.430> bus

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
post fader and finally I route that bus

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.760 
post fader and finally I route that bus
as<00:01:51.030> the<00:01:51.420> key<00:01:51.570> input<00:01:51.960> to<00:01:52.110> the<00:01:52.200> gate<00:01:52.409> on<00:01:52.619> the

as the key input to the gate on the

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.780 
as the key input to the gate on the
oscillator<00:01:53.100> channel<00:01:55.399> so<00:01:56.399> let's<00:01:56.430> head<00:01:56.759> back

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
oscillator channel so let's head back

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.690 
oscillator channel so let's head back
now<00:01:57.180> to<00:01:57.240> our<00:01:57.540> X<00:01:57.840> 32<00:01:58.200> in<00:01:58.920> my<00:01:59.070> case<00:01:59.340> it's<00:01:59.610> the

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
now to our X 32 in my case it's the

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.429 
now to our X 32 in my case it's the
compact<00:02:00.240> model<00:02:00.600> but<00:02:00.780> the<00:02:00.930> features<00:02:01.229> are<00:02:01.380> the

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
compact model but the features are the

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.950 
compact model but the features are the
same<00:02:01.649> across<00:02:01.979> the<00:02:02.070> product<00:02:02.430> line<00:02:02.729> I<00:02:03.060> have<00:02:03.869> the

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
same across the product line I have the

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.660 
same across the product line I have the
board<00:02:04.170> already<00:02:04.530> set<00:02:04.799> up<00:02:04.829> roughly<00:02:05.579> as

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
demonstrated in the original video so

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.350 
demonstrated in the original video so
make<00:02:07.619> sure<00:02:07.649> you<00:02:08.009> watch<00:02:08.310> his<00:02:08.640> first<00:02:09.030> in<00:02:09.239> order

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
make sure you watch his first in order

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.050 
make sure you watch his first in order
to<00:02:09.509> understand<00:02:09.899> how<00:02:09.959> to<00:02:09.989> get<00:02:10.170> to<00:02:10.259> this<00:02:10.349> step<00:02:10.590> I

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 
to understand how to get to this step I

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.910 
to understand how to get to this step I
have<00:02:12.060> the<00:02:12.569> bass<00:02:12.900> drum<00:02:13.200> mic<00:02:13.410> setup

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
have the bass drum mic setup

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.000 
have the bass drum mic setup
here<00:02:14.240> it's<00:02:15.240> coming<00:02:15.569> in<00:02:15.630> to<00:02:15.690> channel<00:02:15.900> one<00:02:16.380> let

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
here it's coming in to channel one let

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.809 
here it's coming in to channel one let
me<00:02:17.069> turn<00:02:17.190> up<00:02:17.370> so<00:02:17.490> you<00:02:17.550> can<00:02:17.670> hear<00:02:17.819> it<00:02:17.849> and<00:02:19.819> I've

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 
me turn up so you can hear it and I've

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:23.210 
me turn up so you can hear it and I've
got<00:02:21.150> a<00:02:21.300> high-pass<00:02:21.840> filter<00:02:22.290> here<00:02:22.560> set<00:02:22.980> up<00:02:23.010> on

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
got a high-pass filter here set up on

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.290 
got a high-pass filter here set up on
that<00:02:23.400> channel<00:02:24.380> there's<00:02:25.380> with<00:02:25.560> it<00:02:25.680> off<00:02:26.300> and

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
that channel there's with it off and

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.690 
that channel there's with it off and
back<00:02:27.510> on<00:02:27.660> again<00:02:27.890> because<00:02:28.890> we<00:02:29.069> don't<00:02:29.340> like<00:02:29.550> the

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
back on again because we don't like the

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.170 
back on again because we don't like the
low<00:02:29.849> sound<00:02:30.120> in<00:02:30.239> that<00:02:30.360> bass<00:02:30.540> drum<00:02:30.810> like<00:02:31.940> so<00:02:32.940> up

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
low sound in that bass drum like so up

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.660 
low sound in that bass drum like so up
here<00:02:33.330> in<00:02:33.420> my<00:02:33.480> oscillator<00:02:33.989> section<00:02:34.230> I've<00:02:35.130> got

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
here in my oscillator section I've got

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.949 
here in my oscillator section I've got
the<00:02:36.060> 50<00:02:36.750> Hertz<00:02:36.930> sine<00:02:37.560> waves<00:02:38.030> being<00:02:39.030> routed<00:02:39.330> to

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 
the 50 Hertz sine waves being routed to

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:42.740 
the 50 Hertz sine waves being routed to
buss<00:02:40.350> 10<00:02:40.590> and<00:02:40.860> as<00:02:41.730> I<00:02:41.850> changed<00:02:42.120> my<00:02:42.239> bus<00:02:42.450> layer

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
buss 10 and as I changed my bus layer

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.990 
buss 10 and as I changed my bus layer
you<00:02:43.500> can<00:02:43.680> see<00:02:43.739> that<00:02:44.010> bus<00:02:44.370> 10<00:02:44.580> has<00:02:44.790> the

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
you can see that bus 10 has the

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.360 
you can see that bus 10 has the
oscillator<00:02:45.390> signal<00:02:48.560> now<00:02:49.560> of<00:02:49.680> course<00:02:50.040> channel

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
oscillator signal now of course channel

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:54.979 
oscillator signal now of course channel
2<00:02:50.550> is<00:02:50.819> set<00:02:51.630> up<00:02:51.750> to<00:02:51.780> be<00:02:51.930> sourced<00:02:52.380> by<00:02:52.530> bus<00:02:52.739> 10<00:02:53.989> so

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989 
2 is set up to be sourced by bus 10 so

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:57.680 
2 is set up to be sourced by bus 10 so
as<00:02:55.110> I<00:02:55.170> turn<00:02:55.319> it<00:02:55.470> up<00:02:56.269> hopefully<00:02:57.269> you<00:02:57.390> can<00:02:57.540> hear

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
as I turn it up hopefully you can hear

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:01.670 
as I turn it up hopefully you can hear
the<00:02:57.780> thump<00:02:58.049> you<00:02:58.920> might<00:02:59.069> need<00:02:59.190> headphones<00:03:00.680> but

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
the thump you might need headphones but

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.100 
the thump you might need headphones but
during<00:03:02.130> a<00:03:02.190> show<00:03:02.519> you<00:03:03.390> can<00:03:03.540> mix<00:03:03.720> these<00:03:03.900> two

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 
during a show you can mix these two

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:06.500 
during a show you can mix these two
around<00:03:04.380> to<00:03:04.620> your<00:03:04.769> ears<00:03:05.130> content<00:03:05.580> changing<00:03:06.450> the

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
around to your ears content changing the

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:08.030 
around to your ears content changing the
balance<00:03:06.810> of<00:03:06.870> the<00:03:07.049> original<00:03:07.410> kick<00:03:07.650> and<00:03:07.890> the

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
balance of the original kick and the

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.670 
balance of the original kick and the
thump<00:03:08.700> sound<00:03:09.000> but<00:03:09.690> channels<00:03:10.230> 1<00:03:10.380> through<00:03:10.530> AG

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
thump sound but channels 1 through AG

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.770 
thump sound but channels 1 through AG
are<00:03:10.890> kind<00:03:11.160> of<00:03:11.220> precious<00:03:11.430> real<00:03:11.700> estate<00:03:12.060> or<00:03:12.330> or

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
are kind of precious real estate or or

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.620 
are kind of precious real estate or or
maybe<00:03:13.200> you<00:03:13.350> went<00:03:13.500> through<00:03:13.560> 16<00:03:14.010> so<00:03:15.000> I'd<00:03:15.420> like

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
maybe you went through 16 so I'd like

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.240 
maybe you went through 16 so I'd like
that<00:03:15.810> typically<00:03:16.110> just<00:03:16.380> mix<00:03:16.650> my<00:03:16.830> kick<00:03:17.010> drum

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
that typically just mix my kick drum

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:19.460 
that typically just mix my kick drum
with<00:03:17.280> channel<00:03:17.700> 1<00:03:17.730> and<00:03:18.540> get<00:03:19.049> the<00:03:19.170> balance

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
with channel 1 and get the balance

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.050 
with channel 1 and get the balance
between<00:03:19.590> the<00:03:19.950> oscillator<00:03:20.400> and<00:03:20.489> a<00:03:20.609> kick<00:03:20.820> right

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
between the oscillator and a kick right

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:24.170 
between the oscillator and a kick right
during<00:03:21.450> sound<00:03:21.780> check<00:03:22.400> so<00:03:23.400> I'm<00:03:23.730> gonna<00:03:23.850> go<00:03:24.060> ahead

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
during sound check so I'm gonna go ahead

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.479 
during sound check so I'm gonna go ahead
and<00:03:24.299> show<00:03:24.450> channel<00:03:25.260> 32<00:03:25.530> which<00:03:25.920> is<00:03:26.040> a<00:03:26.070> pretty

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:26.489 
and show channel 32 which is a pretty

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:28.340 
and show channel 32 which is a pretty
obsolete<00:03:26.730> channel<00:03:27.420> and<00:03:27.570> I'm<00:03:27.989> gonna<00:03:28.109> move<00:03:28.320> my

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
obsolete channel and I'm gonna move my

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:30.620 
obsolete channel and I'm gonna move my
oscillator<00:03:28.950> here<00:03:29.370> and<00:03:29.549> I<00:03:30.269> have<00:03:30.390> a<00:03:30.420> library

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630 
oscillator here and I have a library

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:32.660 
oscillator here and I have a library
preset<00:03:31.380> for<00:03:31.590> it<00:03:31.769> so<00:03:31.920> I'm<00:03:32.040> just<00:03:32.100> gonna<00:03:32.250> recall

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.670 
preset for it so I'm just gonna recall

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:35.780 
preset for it so I'm just gonna recall
it<00:03:32.850> and<00:03:32.970> there's<00:03:33.329> my<00:03:33.480> oscillator<00:03:33.930> on<00:03:34.230> 32<00:03:34.650> and<00:03:35.400> I

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
it and there's my oscillator on 32 and I

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:37.550 
it and there's my oscillator on 32 and I
just<00:03:36.030> need<00:03:36.180> to<00:03:36.209> change<00:03:36.540> its<00:03:36.720> input<00:03:37.079> source<00:03:37.350> to

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
just need to change its input source to

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:44.650 
just need to change its input source to
the<00:03:37.650> oscillator<00:03:38.160> bus<00:03:38.989> which<00:03:39.989> is<00:03:41.000> bussed<00:03:42.000> 10

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:44.660 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:48.440 

there<00:03:45.660> sorry<00:03:46.170> Plus<00:03:46.380> 10<00:03:46.650> wasn't<00:03:47.190> looking<00:03:47.450> only

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450 
there sorry Plus 10 wasn't looking only

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:50.960 
there sorry Plus 10 wasn't looking only
you<00:03:48.570> can<00:03:48.690> see<00:03:48.840> there<00:03:49.019> is<00:03:49.109> the<00:03:49.230> signal<00:03:49.820> so<00:03:50.820> I'm

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
you can see there is the signal so I'm

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:52.970 
you can see there is the signal so I'm
gonna<00:03:51.090> go<00:03:51.269> ahead<00:03:51.390> and<00:03:51.600> blank<00:03:52.200> out<00:03:52.350> channel<00:03:52.769> 2

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
gonna go ahead and blank out channel 2

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:55.699 
gonna go ahead and blank out channel 2
so<00:03:53.310> it's<00:03:53.459> not<00:03:53.609> the<00:03:53.790> way<00:03:54.200> using<00:03:55.200> this<00:03:55.260> preset

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:55.709 
so it's not the way using this preset

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:58.759 
so it's not the way using this preset
and<00:03:55.950> then<00:03:55.980> that's<00:03:56.459> gone<00:03:57.170> so<00:03:58.170> you<00:03:58.260> can<00:03:58.560> hear

00:03:58.759 --> 00:03:58.769 
and then that's gone so you can hear

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:02.210 
and then that's gone so you can hear
channel<00:03:59.220> 32<00:03:59.600> as<00:04:00.600> a<00:04:00.660> thump<00:04:01.109> once<00:04:01.319> again<00:04:01.560> just

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 
channel 32 as a thump once again just

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:04.910 
channel 32 as a thump once again just
like<00:04:02.430> channel<00:04:02.760> 2<00:04:02.910> did<00:04:03.470> okay<00:04:04.470> so<00:04:04.500> we're<00:04:04.829> doing

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:04.920 
like channel 2 did okay so we're doing

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:06.680 
like channel 2 did okay so we're doing
our<00:04:05.160> show<00:04:05.430> here<00:04:05.760> playing<00:04:06.060> around<00:04:06.269> with<00:04:06.510> our

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:06.690 
our show here playing around with our

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:10.309 
our show here playing around with our
DCA's<00:04:07.819> maybe<00:04:08.819> we're<00:04:09.060> moving<00:04:09.840> some<00:04:09.959> faders

00:04:10.309 --> 00:04:10.319 
DCA's maybe we're moving some faders

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:13.309 
DCA's maybe we're moving some faders
around<00:04:10.680> whatever<00:04:11.370> we're<00:04:11.519> doing<00:04:11.639> and<00:04:12.209> we<00:04:13.079> want

00:04:13.309 --> 00:04:13.319 
around whatever we're doing and we want

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:16.190 
around whatever we're doing and we want
to<00:04:13.440> take<00:04:13.799> our<00:04:13.920> kick<00:04:14.100> drum<00:04:14.130> down<00:04:14.639> in<00:04:14.819> the<00:04:14.880> mix<00:04:15.200> so

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:16.200 
to take our kick drum down in the mix so

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:17.569 
to take our kick drum down in the mix so
we<00:04:16.320> lower<00:04:16.470> the<00:04:16.620> fader<00:04:16.829> maybe<00:04:17.130> even<00:04:17.370> want<00:04:17.519> to

00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:17.579 
we lower the fader maybe even want to

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:21.440 
we lower the fader maybe even want to
mute<00:04:17.700> it<00:04:17.850> and<00:04:18.229> thump<00:04:19.229> still<00:04:19.500> there<00:04:20.269> here<00:04:21.269> it<00:04:21.359> is

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:21.450 
mute it and thump still there here it is

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:24.050 
mute it and thump still there here it is
on<00:04:21.570> the<00:04:21.630> handle<00:04:21.840> 32<00:04:22.200> let<00:04:22.320> me<00:04:22.380> turn<00:04:22.500> it<00:04:22.620> up

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.060 
on the handle 32 let me turn it up

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:26.820 
on the handle 32 let me turn it up
and<00:04:25.060> of<00:04:25.419> course<00:04:25.660> that's<00:04:25.900> because<00:04:26.080> our<00:04:26.500> kicks

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:26.830 
and of course that's because our kicks

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:31.379 
and of course that's because our kicks
input<00:04:27.310> is<00:04:27.460> still<00:04:27.669> there<00:04:27.960> and<00:04:29.610> the<00:04:30.610> gate<00:04:30.820> key<00:04:31.120> on

00:04:31.379 --> 00:04:31.389 
input is still there and the gate key on

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:35.430 
input is still there and the gate key on
the<00:04:31.600> oscillator<00:04:31.780> channel<00:04:32.560> is<00:04:32.740> pre-fader<00:04:34.440> all

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:35.440 
the oscillator channel is pre-fader all

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:36.810 
the oscillator channel is pre-fader all
right<00:04:35.620> let<00:04:35.770> me<00:04:35.860> go<00:04:35.949> ahead<00:04:36.070> and<00:04:36.250> turn<00:04:36.460> that<00:04:36.669> down

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:36.820 
right let me go ahead and turn that down

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:41.159 
right let me go ahead and turn that down
for<00:04:37.030> a<00:04:37.120> second<00:04:39.660> all<00:04:40.660> right<00:04:40.720> now<00:04:40.990> the<00:04:41.050> next

00:04:41.159 --> 00:04:41.169 
for a second all right now the next

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:43.050 
for a second all right now the next
thing<00:04:41.560> I<00:04:41.680> said<00:04:41.889> we'd<00:04:42.100> have<00:04:42.370> to<00:04:42.550> do<00:04:42.729> is

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:43.060 
thing I said we'd have to do is

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:45.719 
thing I said we'd have to do is
configure<00:04:43.509> another<00:04:43.810> bus<00:04:44.220> bus<00:04:45.220> nine<00:04:45.430> in<00:04:45.610> this

00:04:45.719 --> 00:04:45.729 
configure another bus bus nine in this

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:48.300 
configure another bus bus nine in this
case<00:04:45.970> to<00:04:46.930> use<00:04:47.080> for<00:04:47.259> the<00:04:47.320> post-fader<00:04:47.740> kick<00:04:48.039> drum

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:48.310 
case to use for the post-fader kick drum

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:52.050 
case to use for the post-fader kick drum
o<00:04:49.199> bus<00:04:50.199> nine<00:04:50.560> and<00:04:51.130> let<00:04:51.430> me<00:04:51.520> actually<00:04:51.669> make<00:04:51.970> this

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:52.060 
o bus nine and let me actually make this

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:55.800 
o bus nine and let me actually make this
visible<00:04:52.509> in<00:04:53.169> the<00:04:53.530> scribble<00:04:53.949> strips<00:04:54.690> there<00:04:55.690> we

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:55.810 
visible in the scribble strips there we

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:58.860 
visible in the scribble strips there we
go<00:04:55.960> yellow<00:04:56.380> is<00:04:56.470> pretty<00:04:56.710> readable<00:04:57.360> so<00:04:58.360> the<00:04:58.599> next

00:04:58.860 --> 00:04:58.870 
go yellow is pretty readable so the next

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:00.659 
go yellow is pretty readable so the next
thing<00:04:59.020> we<00:04:59.139> actually<00:04:59.560> need<00:04:59.710> to<00:04:59.830> do<00:05:00.039> is<00:05:00.310> make

00:05:00.659 --> 00:05:00.669 
thing we actually need to do is make

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:03.950 
thing we actually need to do is make
sure<00:05:00.699> this<00:05:00.970> is<00:05:01.150> set<00:05:01.300> up<00:05:01.330> as<00:05:01.539> a<00:05:01.570> post-fader<00:05:02.320> bus

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:03.960 
sure this is set up as a post-fader bus

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:07.110 
sure this is set up as a post-fader bus
so<00:05:04.960> here<00:05:05.320> in<00:05:05.500> the<00:05:05.680> bus<00:05:06.009> configuration<00:05:06.789> screen

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:07.120 
so here in the bus configuration screen

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:10.050 
so here in the bus configuration screen
I'll<00:05:07.300> go<00:05:07.449> ahead<00:05:07.570> and<00:05:07.960> use<00:05:07.990> a<00:05:08.440> sub<00:05:09.430> group<00:05:09.729> for

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:10.060 
I'll go ahead and use a sub group for

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:15.689 
I'll go ahead and use a sub group for
this<00:05:10.240> bus<00:05:12.479> okay<00:05:13.479> now<00:05:13.990> odd<00:05:14.470> and<00:05:14.740> even<00:05:14.830> pairs<00:05:15.280> of

00:05:15.689 --> 00:05:15.699 
this bus okay now odd and even pairs of

00:05:15.699 --> 00:05:18.120 
this bus okay now odd and even pairs of
course<00:05:16.060> are<00:05:16.270> configured<00:05:16.900> together<00:05:17.380> so<00:05:17.800> as<00:05:18.070> I

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:18.130 
course are configured together so as I

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:19.589 
course are configured together so as I
switch<00:05:18.430> between<00:05:18.610> nine<00:05:18.970> and<00:05:19.000> ten<00:05:19.270> you'll<00:05:19.449> see

00:05:19.589 --> 00:05:19.599 
switch between nine and ten you'll see

00:05:19.599 --> 00:05:21.689 
switch between nine and ten you'll see
they're<00:05:19.750> both<00:05:19.960> showing<00:05:20.259> as<00:05:20.500> sub<00:05:20.740> groups<00:05:20.979> which

00:05:21.689 --> 00:05:21.699 
they're both showing as sub groups which

00:05:21.699 --> 00:05:23.790 
they're both showing as sub groups which
is<00:05:21.849> okay<00:05:22.150> because<00:05:22.389> the<00:05:22.720> oscillator<00:05:23.139> is<00:05:23.470> being

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:23.800 
is okay because the oscillator is being

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:25.890 
is okay because the oscillator is being
used<00:05:23.979> for<00:05:24.099> bus<00:05:24.280> 10<00:05:24.580> and<00:05:24.940> of<00:05:25.120> course<00:05:25.360> there's<00:05:25.750> no

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:25.900 
used for bus 10 and of course there's no

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:29.189 
used for bus 10 and of course there's no
fader<00:05:26.169> to<00:05:26.380> affect<00:05:26.710> it<00:05:27.300> so<00:05:28.300> next<00:05:28.810> I<00:05:29.020> actually

00:05:29.189 --> 00:05:29.199 
fader to affect it so next I actually

00:05:29.199 --> 00:05:32.210 
fader to affect it so next I actually
need<00:05:29.650> to<00:05:29.740> send<00:05:30.159> my<00:05:30.370> bass<00:05:30.580> drum<00:05:30.909> to<00:05:31.060> this<00:05:31.210> bus

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:32.220 
need to send my bass drum to this bus

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:35.730 
need to send my bass drum to this bus
she's<00:05:33.220> already<00:05:33.400> selected<00:05:33.909> let's<00:05:34.840> first<00:05:35.199> bring

she's already selected let's first bring
it<00:05:35.919> up<00:05:36.039> to<00:05:36.220> unity<00:05:36.669> and<00:05:37.320> you<00:05:38.320> sends<00:05:38.650> on<00:05:38.770> fader<00:05:38.800> of

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:39.520 
it up to unity and you sends on fader of

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:41.339 
it up to unity and you sends on fader of
course<00:05:39.820> is<00:05:40.030> the<00:05:40.210> sub<00:05:40.449> group<00:05:40.690> I<00:05:40.870> just<00:05:41.110> need<00:05:41.260> to

00:05:41.339 --> 00:05:41.349 
course is the sub group I just need to

00:05:41.349 --> 00:05:43.379 
course is the sub group I just need to
unmute<00:05:41.830> it<00:05:42.039> since<00:05:42.340> the<00:05:42.610> feted<00:05:43.000> levels<00:05:43.300> don't

00:05:43.379 --> 00:05:43.389 
unmute it since the feted levels don't

00:05:43.389 --> 00:05:46.980 
unmute it since the feted levels don't
actually<00:05:43.599> matter<00:05:45.180> now<00:05:46.180> let's<00:05:46.510> go<00:05:46.630> ahead<00:05:46.750> and

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:46.990 
actually matter now let's go ahead and

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:50.100 
actually matter now let's go ahead and
exit<00:05:47.620> sends<00:05:48.010> on<00:05:48.130> fader<00:05:48.510> onion<00:05:49.510> our<00:05:49.599> channel

drum back one second there it goes again
so<00:06:00.280> now<00:06:00.460> you<00:06:00.520> can<00:06:00.759> see<00:06:01.330> here<00:06:01.570> in<00:06:01.690> bus<00:06:01.900> nine<00:06:02.199> our

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:02.650 
so now you can see here in bus nine our

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:04.499 
so now you can see here in bus nine our
subgroup<00:06:03.370> that<00:06:03.400> we've<00:06:03.759> got<00:06:03.940> the<00:06:04.120> kick<00:06:04.300> drum

00:06:04.499 --> 00:06:04.509 
subgroup that we've got the kick drum

00:06:04.509 --> 00:06:07.640 
subgroup that we've got the kick drum
signal<00:06:04.750> coming<00:06:05.349> in<00:06:05.530> post<00:06:05.860> fader

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:11.730 
signal coming in post fader
okay<00:06:08.650> so<00:06:08.710> let's<00:06:09.340> hop<00:06:09.639> back<00:06:09.970> to<00:06:10.599> our<00:06:10.870> oscillator

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:11.740 
okay so let's hop back to our oscillator

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:13.800 
okay so let's hop back to our oscillator
channel<00:06:12.220> note<00:06:12.370> which<00:06:12.580> is<00:06:12.610> channel<00:06:13.090> 32<00:06:13.360> and

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:13.810 
channel note which is channel 32 and

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:17.370 
channel note which is channel 32 and
let's<00:06:14.349> go<00:06:14.470> to<00:06:14.590> our<00:06:14.710> gate<00:06:15.099> section<00:06:15.960> now<00:06:16.960> we<00:06:17.020> have

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:17.380 
let's go to our gate section now we have

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:20.700 
let's go to our gate section now we have
to<00:06:17.500> make<00:06:17.650> one<00:06:17.919> change<00:06:18.430> as<00:06:18.820> we<00:06:19.060> said<00:06:19.270> before<00:06:19.710> and

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:20.710 
to make one change as we said before and

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:22.890 
to make one change as we said before and
that's<00:06:20.800> to<00:06:20.949> go<00:06:21.070> into<00:06:21.340> our<00:06:21.460> key<00:06:21.669> source<00:06:21.970> here<00:06:22.750> on

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:22.900 
that's to go into our key source here on

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:24.899 
that's to go into our key source here on
the<00:06:23.020> second<00:06:23.349> layer<00:06:23.530> and<00:06:23.979> change<00:06:24.430> that<00:06:24.639> from

00:06:24.899 --> 00:06:24.909 
the second layer and change that from

00:06:24.909 --> 00:06:27.450 
the second layer and change that from
channel<00:06:25.599> one<00:06:25.840> which<00:06:26.349> was<00:06:26.590> from<00:06:27.130> our<00:06:27.250> previous

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:27.460 
channel one which was from our previous

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:31.260 
channel one which was from our previous
set<00:06:27.820> up<00:06:27.940> to<00:06:28.690> now<00:06:28.870> be<00:06:29.110> our<00:06:29.590> post<00:06:30.340> fade<00:06:30.669> kick<00:06:31.000> drum

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:31.270 
set up to now be our post fade kick drum

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:31.970 
set up to now be our post fade kick drum
Channel

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:31.980 
Channel

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:39.830 
Channel
which<00:06:32.130> of<00:06:32.370> course<00:06:32.400> is<00:06:33.260> bus<00:06:34.260> 9<00:06:34.680> yeah<00:06:35.430> bus<00:06:35.730> 9<00:06:38.840> okay

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:39.840 
which of course is bus 9 yeah bus 9 okay

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:42.380 
which of course is bus 9 yeah bus 9 okay
let<00:06:40.710> me<00:06:40.800> actually<00:06:40.980> go<00:06:41.250> ahead<00:06:41.370> and<00:06:41.580> lower<00:06:42.180> the

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:42.390 
let me actually go ahead and lower the

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:45.320 
let me actually go ahead and lower the
gates<00:06:42.600> threshold<00:06:43.230> a<00:06:43.320> little<00:06:43.740> bit<00:06:43.950> here<00:06:44.430> on<00:06:44.640> the

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:45.330 
gates threshold a little bit here on the

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:49.820 
gates threshold a little bit here on the
oscillator<00:06:46.080> channel<00:06:46.650> and<00:06:46.980> 32<00:06:48.020> and<00:06:49.020> now<00:06:49.410> as<00:06:49.680> I

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:49.830 
oscillator channel and 32 and now as I

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:53.770 
oscillator channel and 32 and now as I
adjust<00:06:49.980> the<00:06:50.400> fader<00:06:51.300> on<00:06:51.690> my<00:06:52.230> kick<00:06:52.470> drum<00:06:52.500> channel

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:53.780 
adjust the fader on my kick drum channel

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:56.690 
adjust the fader on my kick drum channel
watch<00:06:54.780> the<00:06:55.080> gate<00:06:55.380> input<00:06:55.950> here<00:06:56.220> on<00:06:56.340> the<00:06:56.460> screen

00:06:56.690 --> 00:06:56.700 
watch the gate input here on the screen

00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:58.880 
watch the gate input here on the screen
so<00:06:57.420> as<00:06:57.570> I<00:06:57.720> move<00:06:57.870> the<00:06:58.020> fader<00:06:58.260> of<00:06:58.410> the<00:06:58.530> kick<00:06:58.680> drum

00:06:58.880 --> 00:06:58.890 
so as I move the fader of the kick drum

00:06:58.890 --> 00:07:01.430 
so as I move the fader of the kick drum
down<00:06:59.130> you'll<00:06:59.910> see<00:07:00.060> that<00:07:00.210> it's<00:07:00.440> peaking

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:01.440 
down you'll see that it's peaking

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:03.140 
down you'll see that it's peaking
farther<00:07:01.800> away<00:07:01.950> from<00:07:02.310> the<00:07:02.430> gate<00:07:02.610> you<00:07:02.850> know<00:07:02.970> that

00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:03.150 
farther away from the gate you know that

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:05.210 
farther away from the gate you know that
pull<00:07:03.540> it<00:07:03.600> back<00:07:03.750> up<00:07:03.780> it's<00:07:04.170> peaking<00:07:04.620> closer<00:07:04.890> and

00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:05.220 
pull it back up it's peaking closer and

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:07.850 
pull it back up it's peaking closer and
then<00:07:05.400> exceeding<00:07:06.360> the<00:07:06.450> gate<00:07:06.630> which<00:07:07.500> is<00:07:07.620> not

00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:07.860 
then exceeding the gate which is not

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:09.650 
then exceeding the gate which is not

to<00:07:09.900> do<00:07:10.080> so<00:07:10.650> up<00:07:10.800> here<00:07:11.160> using<00:07:11.760> the<00:07:11.970> second

00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:12.300 
to do so up here using the second

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:13.970 
to do so up here using the second
encoder<00:07:12.570> we<00:07:12.780> can<00:07:12.930> give<00:07:13.110> the<00:07:13.380> function<00:07:13.590> of<00:07:13.890> the

00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:13.980 
encoder we can give the function of the

00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:16.520 
gates threshold a little bit of a slope

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:19.100 
gates threshold a little bit of a slope
at<00:07:17.520> this<00:07:17.700> point<00:07:17.820> just<00:07:18.150> tweak<00:07:18.450> things<00:07:18.690> until<00:07:19.020> it

00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:19.110 
at this point just tweak things until it

at this point just tweak things until it
sounds<00:07:19.320> the<00:07:19.620> way<00:07:19.740> you<00:07:19.800> like<00:07:20.090> so<00:07:21.090> now<00:07:21.780> as<00:07:21.990> I

00:07:22.130 --> 00:07:22.140 
sounds the way you like so now as I

00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:24.200 
sounds the way you like so now as I
adjust<00:07:22.290> the<00:07:22.650> attenuation<00:07:22.980> of<00:07:23.670> the<00:07:23.730> kick<00:07:24.000> drum

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:24.210 
adjust the attenuation of the kick drum

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:28.790 
adjust the attenuation of the kick drum
channel<00:07:26.540> the<00:07:27.540> gate<00:07:27.810> reacts<00:07:28.230> accordingly

00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:28.800 
channel the gate reacts accordingly

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:30.860 
channel the gate reacts accordingly
giving<00:07:29.430> them<00:07:29.550> gradually<00:07:29.910> more<00:07:30.210> or<00:07:30.420> less<00:07:30.600> sine

00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:30.870 
giving them gradually more or less sine

00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:33.830 
giving them gradually more or less sine
wave<00:07:31.250> so<00:07:32.250> I<00:07:32.310> can<00:07:32.460> adjust<00:07:32.640> the<00:07:32.790> kick<00:07:32.970> drum<00:07:33.210> here

00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:33.840 
wave so I can adjust the kick drum here

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:37.220 
wave so I can adjust the kick drum here
with<00:07:34.380> one<00:07:34.560> fader<00:07:34.830> and<00:07:35.540> you<00:07:36.540> know<00:07:36.660> while<00:07:36.900> I<00:07:36.930> had

00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:37.230 
with one fader and you know while I had

00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:39.470 
with one fader and you know while I had
to<00:07:37.350> use<00:07:37.500> another<00:07:37.740> bus<00:07:38.010> for<00:07:38.280> it<00:07:38.370> that<00:07:38.940> second

00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:39.480 
to use another bus for it that second

00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:41.420 
to use another bus for it that second
oscillator<00:07:39.750> channel<00:07:40.410> is<00:07:40.500> now<00:07:40.710> out<00:07:40.980> of<00:07:41.220> the<00:07:41.280> way

00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:41.430 
oscillator channel is now out of the way
