00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:02.280 
have these towers putting out everything

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.510 
have these towers putting out everything
and<00:00:02.460> you<00:00:02.970> have<00:00:03.090> utopia<00:00:03.600> but<00:00:03.870> suddenly<00:00:04.370> this<00:00:05.370> is

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:05.520 
and you have utopia but suddenly this is

and you have utopia but suddenly this is
what<00:00:05.700> I've<00:00:05.910> studied<00:00:06.240> edgar<00:00:06.569> cayce<00:00:06.839> and<00:00:07.140> things

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:07.319 
what I've studied edgar cayce and things

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:09.530 
what I've studied edgar cayce and things
like<00:00:07.440> that<00:00:07.500> out<00:00:07.680> they<00:00:08.370> developed<00:00:09.059> the<00:00:09.300> door

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
like that out they developed the door

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.270 
like that out they developed the door
answers<00:00:10.080> who<00:00:10.200> developed<00:00:10.590> the<00:00:10.650> dark<00:00:10.950> side<00:00:11.250> of

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
answers who developed the dark side of

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.749 
answers who developed the dark side of
technology<00:00:11.750> well<00:00:12.750> it<00:00:13.710> could<00:00:14.009> blow<00:00:14.190> up<00:00:14.460> in<00:00:14.610> our

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
technology well it could blow up in our

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:16.939 
technology well it could blow up in our
face<00:00:15.150> and<00:00:15.480> that's<00:00:15.870> why<00:00:16.109> there<00:00:16.379> are<00:00:16.410> these<00:00:16.680> huge

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
face and that's why there are these huge

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.609 
face and that's why there are these huge
ruins<00:00:17.910> today<00:00:18.150> we<00:00:18.359> can't<00:00:18.660> build<00:00:18.960> and<00:00:19.320> look<00:00:19.500> what

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
ruins today we can't build and look what

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.740 
ruins today we can't build and look what
happened<00:00:19.920> to<00:00:20.070> the<00:00:20.310> society<00:00:20.670> so<00:00:21.090> my<00:00:21.420> answer<00:00:21.570> is

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
happened to the society so my answer is

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.410 
happened to the society so my answer is
developing<00:00:22.260> a<00:00:22.380> Tesla<00:00:22.769> society<00:00:23.400> yeah<00:00:24.000> we<00:00:24.240> can

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
developing a Tesla society yeah we can

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.900 
developing a Tesla society yeah we can
do<00:00:24.689> it<00:00:24.869> in<00:00:24.960> the<00:00:25.080> far<00:00:25.320> future<00:00:25.350> our<00:00:26.189> ancestors

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
do it in the far future our ancestors

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.689 
do it in the far future our ancestors
not<00:00:27.090> us<00:00:27.269> yeah<00:00:28.140> but<00:00:28.349> we<00:00:28.890> have<00:00:28.980> to<00:00:29.070> be<00:00:29.189> very<00:00:29.400> very

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
not us yeah but we have to be very very

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.179 
not us yeah but we have to be very very
careful<00:00:30.060> because<00:00:30.480> we're<00:00:31.439> done<00:00:31.560> how<00:00:31.769> did<00:00:32.040> the

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
careful because we're done how did the

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.520 
careful because we're done how did the
inferior<00:00:32.969> version<00:00:33.750> of<00:00:33.840> technology<00:00:34.320> that<00:00:34.440> we

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
inferior version of technology that we

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.620 
inferior version of technology that we
have<00:00:34.559> today<00:00:34.710> get<00:00:35.579> put<00:00:35.730> in<00:00:35.820> place<00:00:36.030> instead<00:00:36.510> of

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
have today get put in place instead of

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.229 
have today get put in place instead of
this<00:00:36.840> more<00:00:37.260> advanced<00:00:37.530> building<00:00:38.430> the<00:00:38.700> griddle

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
this more advanced building the griddle

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.090 
this more advanced building the griddle
upward<00:00:39.480> of<00:00:39.600> the<00:00:39.690> dark<00:00:39.930> 80<00:00:40.140> blew<00:00:40.620> up<00:00:40.800> it<00:00:40.950> was

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
upward of the dark 80 blew up it was

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.869 
upward of the dark 80 blew up it was
rebuilt<00:00:41.280> again<00:00:41.640> by<00:00:42.090> the<00:00:42.980> Egyptian<00:00:43.980> blew<00:00:44.760> up
