something<00:00:42.220> that's<00:00:42.460> simple<00:00:42.880> and<00:00:43.090> I'm<00:00:43.750> just

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:43.870 
something that's simple and I'm just

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:45.510 
something that's simple and I'm just
like<00:00:43.989> how<00:00:44.079> do<00:00:44.140> you<00:00:44.170> forget<00:00:44.320> that<00:00:44.470> but<00:00:44.860> when<00:00:45.430> you

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:45.520 
like how do you forget that but when you

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.670 
like how do you forget that but when you
win<00:00:45.730> a<00:00:45.760> lot<00:00:46.030> like<00:00:46.180> we<00:00:46.300> won<00:00:46.420> I<00:00:46.450> am<00:00:46.810> we<00:00:47.410> kind<00:00:47.620> of

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:47.680 
win a lot like we won I am we kind of

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:49.770 
win a lot like we won I am we kind of
just<00:00:47.800> got<00:00:48.250> relaxed<00:00:48.970> and<00:00:49.210> didn't<00:00:49.450> really<00:00:49.630> think

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:49.780 
just got relaxed and didn't really think

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:51.960 
just got relaxed and didn't really think
that<00:00:49.899> anything<00:00:50.380> we<00:00:50.470> were<00:00:50.559> doing<00:00:50.829> was<00:00:51.040> like<00:00:51.790> too

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:51.970 
that anything we were doing was like too

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:53.250 
that anything we were doing was like too
meaningful<00:00:52.390> because<00:00:52.450> we've<00:00:52.780> lost<00:00:52.930> a<00:00:53.050> lot<00:00:53.110> of

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:53.260 
meaningful because we've lost a lot of

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:53.700 
meaningful because we've lost a lot of
scrims

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:53.710 
scrims

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:55.590 
scrims
in<00:00:53.829> the<00:00:54.220> past<00:00:54.430> I<00:00:54.790> think<00:00:54.880> leading<00:00:55.180> up<00:00:55.270> to<00:00:55.329> Worlds

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:55.600 
in the past I think leading up to Worlds

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.030 
in the past I think leading up to Worlds
we<00:00:55.720> lost<00:00:55.899> so<00:00:56.140> many<00:00:56.230> scams<00:00:56.559> but<00:00:56.890> we<00:00:56.950> were

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:57.040 
we lost so many scams but we were

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:58.799 
we lost so many scams but we were
playing<00:00:57.250> like<00:00:57.940> the<00:00:58.270> best<00:00:58.420> teams<00:00:58.630> in<00:00:58.690> the<00:00:58.750> world

00:00:58.799 --> 00:00:58.809 
playing like the best teams in the world

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:00.270 
playing like the best teams in the world
we<00:00:58.989> were<00:00:59.050> playing<00:00:59.200> Samsung<00:00:59.590> blue<00:00:59.800> Samsung

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:00.280 
we were playing Samsung blue Samsung

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.190 
we were playing Samsung blue Samsung
white<00:01:00.460> and<00:01:00.700> it<00:01:01.270> was<00:01:01.360> like<00:01:01.480> respectable<00:01:02.079> to

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:02.200 
white and it was like respectable to

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:03.330 
white and it was like respectable to
loosen<00:01:02.469> them<00:01:02.530> because<00:01:02.800> they<00:01:02.920> were<00:01:02.980> so<00:01:03.040> good

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:03.340 
loosen them because they were so good

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:06.090 
loosen them because they were so good
but<00:01:03.899> now<00:01:04.899> if<00:01:05.290> we're<00:01:05.469> losing<00:01:05.560> scrams

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:06.100 
but now if we're losing scrams

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:07.920 
but now if we're losing scrams
well<00:01:06.640> I<00:01:06.670> mean<00:01:06.850> now<00:01:07.060> we<00:01:07.119> picked<00:01:07.570> it<00:01:07.600> up<00:01:07.689> but

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:07.930 
well I mean now we picked it up but

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:09.929 
well I mean now we picked it up but
before<00:01:08.530> when<00:01:08.770> we<00:01:08.860> before<00:01:09.399> the<00:01:09.490> first<00:01:09.670> week<00:01:09.850> in

00:01:09.929 --> 00:01:09.939 
before when we before the first week in

00:01:09.939 --> 00:01:11.660 
before when we before the first week in
the<00:01:09.999> second<00:01:10.240> week<00:01:10.359> we<00:01:10.600> were<00:01:10.959> just<00:01:11.109> kind<00:01:11.289> of

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
the second week we were just kind of

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.099 
the second week we were just kind of
thinking<00:01:12.670> that<00:01:12.850> the<00:01:13.149> losing<00:01:13.600> scrims<00:01:13.840> didn't

00:01:14.099 --> 00:01:14.109 
thinking that the losing scrims didn't

00:01:14.109 --> 00:01:15.690 
thinking that the losing scrims didn't
matter<00:01:14.350> that<00:01:14.409> much<00:01:14.619> because<00:01:14.829> we<00:01:15.189> yeah<00:01:15.429> we<00:01:15.459> just

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:15.700 
matter that much because we yeah we just

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:18.120 
matter that much because we yeah we just
will<00:01:16.030> do<00:01:16.149> well<00:01:16.299> in<00:01:16.479> LCS<00:01:16.869> but<00:01:17.139> didn't<00:01:17.979> really

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:18.130 
will do well in LCS but didn't really

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:21.629 
will do well in LCS but didn't really

in Florida I thought she was okay

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:57.809 
in Florida I thought she was okay
because<00:01:56.649> that's<00:01:56.979> only<00:01:57.099> champ<00:01:57.369> I<00:01:57.459> can<00:01:57.609> play<00:01:57.759> in

out in competitive like all over China
and<00:02:02.889> Korea<00:02:03.459> so<00:02:04.209> it<00:02:04.270> was<00:02:04.359> really<00:02:04.569> weird<00:02:04.749> and

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:05.079 
and Korea so it was really weird and

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:07.139 
and Korea so it was really weird and

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:13.620 
don't think she has a pretty bad laning
phase<00:02:11.830> and<00:02:12.069> she's<00:02:12.940> really<00:02:13.120> good<00:02:13.239> at<00:02:13.330> happen<00:02:13.540> if

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
phase and she's really good at happen if

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:15.510 
phase and she's really good at happen if
a<00:02:13.720> headbutt<00:02:14.200> she<00:02:14.470> doesn't<00:02:14.680> do<00:02:14.890> much<00:02:15.040> if<00:02:15.220> behind

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:15.520 
a headbutt she doesn't do much if behind

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.130

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:17.380 
they're getting poked down or the lane

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:20.069 
they're getting poked down or the lane
to<00:03:17.530> pushing<00:03:18.060> for<00:03:19.060> them<00:03:19.239> then<00:03:19.690> they<00:03:19.720> can't

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:20.079 
to pushing for them then they can't

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:22.680 
to pushing for them then they can't
actually<00:03:20.319> act<00:03:20.890> upon<00:03:21.310> anything<00:03:21.910> at<00:03:22.000> all<00:03:22.090> so<00:03:22.329> I

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
actually act upon anything at all so I

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:24.270 
actually act upon anything at all so I
feel<00:03:23.410> like<00:03:23.440> that<00:03:23.590> Lane<00:03:23.709> is<00:03:23.829> just<00:03:23.950> kind<00:03:24.100> of<00:03:24.130> bad

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280 
feel like that Lane is just kind of bad

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.059 
feel like that Lane is just kind of bad
and<00:03:24.579> I<00:03:25.120> don't<00:03:25.329> know<00:03:25.389> like<00:03:26.290> even<00:03:26.590> though<00:03:26.680> piglet

00:03:27.059 --> 00:03:27.069 
and I don't know like even though piglet

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:29.759 
and I don't know like even though piglet
and<00:03:27.700> maple<00:03:28.000> are<00:03:28.060> good<00:03:28.239> I<00:03:28.480> think<00:03:29.019> we<00:03:29.440> do<00:03:29.620> have

00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:29.769 
and maple are good I think we do have

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:32.699 
and maple are good I think we do have
the<00:03:29.980> better<00:03:30.340> link<00:03:30.609> composition<00:03:31.299> for<00:03:31.650> what<00:03:32.650> we

00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:32.709 
the better link composition for what we

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:35.940 
the better link composition for what we
had<00:03:32.859> so<00:03:33.280> I<00:03:33.519> don't<00:03:33.730> know<00:03:34.590> it's<00:03:35.590> hard<00:03:35.739> to<00:03:35.799> tell

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:35.950 
had so I don't know it's hard to tell

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:37.229 
had so I don't know it's hard to tell
because<00:03:36.069> I<00:03:36.310> mean<00:03:36.430> piglets<00:03:36.910> a<00:03:36.940> good<00:03:37.060> player

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:37.239 
because I mean piglets a good player

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:39.059 
because I mean piglets a good player
Mabel's<00:03:37.660> a<00:03:37.690> good<00:03:37.810> player<00:03:37.959> it's<00:03:38.410> just<00:03:38.680> I<00:03:38.799> think

00:03:39.059 --> 00:03:39.069 
Mabel's a good player it's just I think

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:41.520 
Mabel's a good player it's just I think
Sarah's<00:03:39.639> weak<00:03:39.970> laning<00:03:40.269> phase<00:03:40.420> and<00:03:40.530> the

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:41.530 
Sarah's weak laning phase and the

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:43.379 
Sarah's weak laning phase and the
champions<00:03:42.040> we<00:03:42.250> had<00:03:42.370> like<00:03:42.609> Graves<00:03:42.850> and<00:03:43.000> any<00:03:43.150> can

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:43.389 
champions we had like Graves and any can

00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:46.620 
champions we had like Graves and any can
abuse<00:03:43.569> that<00:03:43.769> so<00:03:44.769> now<00:03:45.639> that<00:03:45.670> you<00:03:46.180> guys<00:03:46.329> are<00:03:46.510> kind

just gonna be a timely thing I think

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:00.809 
just gonna be a timely thing I think
it's<00:03:58.660> everything<00:03:58.959> coming<00:03:59.380> together<00:03:59.609> I'd<00:04:00.609> say

00:04:00.809 --> 00:04:00.819 
it's everything coming together I'd say

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:02.580 
it's everything coming together I'd say
hi<00:04:00.940> as<00:04:01.000> putting<00:04:01.269> a<00:04:01.389> lot<00:04:01.510> more<00:04:01.540> effort<00:04:01.630> and<00:04:02.079> I

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:02.590 
hi as putting a lot more effort and I

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:05.039 
hi as putting a lot more effort and I
know<00:04:03.370> with<00:04:03.700> our<00:04:03.730> when<00:04:04.090> we<00:04:04.120> had<00:04:04.329> bad<00:04:04.540> scrims

00:04:05.039 --> 00:04:05.049 
know with our when we had bad scrims

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:07.199 
know with our when we had bad scrims
what<00:04:05.709> would<00:04:05.799> happen<00:04:06.069> is<00:04:06.220> people<00:04:06.819> were<00:04:07.000> dying

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:07.209 
what would happen is people were dying

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:08.729 
what would happen is people were dying
everywhere<00:04:07.510> but<00:04:07.930> like<00:04:08.079> I<00:04:08.260> guess<00:04:08.410> die<00:04:08.590> would

00:04:08.729 --> 00:04:08.739 
everywhere but like I guess die would

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:10.199 
everywhere but like I guess die would
higher<00:04:09.069> high<00:04:09.280> would<00:04:09.400> die<00:04:09.549> to<00:04:09.609> like<00:04:09.819> level<00:04:10.120> two

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:10.209 
higher high would die to like level two

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:12.120 
higher high would die to like level two
ganks<00:04:10.540> and<00:04:10.630> stuff<00:04:10.870> and<00:04:11.079> you<00:04:11.590> just<00:04:11.739> like<00:04:11.950> forget

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:12.130 
ganks and stuff and you just like forget

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:14.490 
ganks and stuff and you just like forget
about<00:04:12.340> it<00:04:12.549> so<00:04:12.579> that's<00:04:13.239> getting<00:04:13.660> fixed<00:04:14.079> and<00:04:14.230> if

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:14.500 
about it so that's getting fixed and if

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:16.680 
about it so that's getting fixed and if
that<00:04:14.620> gets<00:04:14.799> fixed<00:04:15.160> then<00:04:15.280> we<00:04:15.340> get<00:04:15.459> a<00:04:15.519> more<00:04:16.180> LCS

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:16.690 
that gets fixed then we get a more LCS

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:19.979 
that gets fixed then we get a more LCS
like<00:04:17.590> game<00:04:17.829> which<00:04:18.820> means<00:04:19.000> that<00:04:19.359> we<00:04:19.870> can

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:19.989 
like game which means that we can

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:21.420 
like game which means that we can
actually<00:04:20.049> get<00:04:20.320> good<00:04:20.440> practice<00:04:20.829> now<00:04:20.950> so<00:04:21.190> I

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:21.430 
actually get good practice now so I

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:23.580 
actually get good practice now so I
think<00:04:21.669> through<00:04:22.389> that<00:04:22.570> it's<00:04:22.930> kind<00:04:23.169> of<00:04:23.229> making

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:23.590 
think through that it's kind of making

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:25.529 
think through that it's kind of making
all<00:04:23.770> our<00:04:23.800> practice<00:04:24.250> better<00:04:24.430> and<00:04:24.760> we<00:04:25.060> can<00:04:25.090> play

00:04:25.529 --> 00:04:25.539 
all our practice better and we can play

00:04:25.539 --> 00:04:27.540 
all our practice better and we can play
better<00:04:25.660> and<00:04:25.930> LCS<00:04:26.260> do<00:04:26.919> you<00:04:27.010> watch<00:04:27.190> a<00:04:27.280> little<00:04:27.340> bit

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:27.550 
better and LCS do you watch a little bit

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:29.760 
better and LCS do you watch a little bit
you<00:04:27.669> LCS<00:04:28.090> as<00:04:28.270> well<00:04:28.419> yeah<00:04:29.110> I<00:04:29.140> usually<00:04:29.650> you<00:04:29.710> have

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:29.770 
you LCS as well yeah I usually you have

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:31.740 
you LCS as well yeah I usually you have
to<00:04:29.919> wake<00:04:30.039> up<00:04:30.070> by<00:04:30.460> the<00:04:30.520> time<00:04:30.700> it's<00:04:30.880> the<00:04:31.300> second

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:31.750 
to wake up by the time it's the second

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:33.300 
to wake up by the time it's the second
game<00:04:31.900> so<00:04:32.530> I

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:33.310 
game so I

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:35.040 
game so I
a<00:04:33.340> little<00:04:33.850> bit<00:04:34.000> but<00:04:34.240> we<00:04:34.330> did<00:04:34.450> the<00:04:34.570> scrim<00:04:34.810> at

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.050 
a little bit but we did the scrim at

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:36.570 
a little bit but we did the scrim at
that<00:04:35.200> time<00:04:35.320> as<00:04:35.440> well<00:04:35.800> so<00:04:35.950> I<00:04:36.010> tuned<00:04:36.430> in

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:36.580 
that time as well so I tuned in

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:37.440 
that time as well so I tuned in
in-between<00:04:37.000> scrims

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:37.450 
in-between scrims

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:39.240 
in-between scrims
every<00:04:37.750> now<00:04:37.840> and<00:04:37.990> then<00:04:38.050> so<00:04:38.680> I<00:04:38.710> just<00:04:39.100> had<00:04:39.220> a

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:39.250 
every now and then so I just had a

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:42.870 
every now and then so I just had a
recent<00:04:39.780> on<00:04:40.780> my<00:04:40.900> show<00:04:41.050> different<00:04:41.470> I<00:04:42.010> had<00:04:42.550> talked

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:42.880 
recent on my show different I had talked

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:44.490 
recent on my show different I had talked
to<00:04:42.940> forgiven<00:04:43.390> and<00:04:43.840> he<00:04:43.930> actually<00:04:44.230> says<00:04:44.470> that

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:44.500 
to forgiven and he actually says that

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:49.640 
to forgiven and he actually says that
you<00:04:45.130> are<00:04:45.370> top<00:04:46.120> top<00:04:46.660> to<00:04:46.900> easily<00:04:47.710> top<00:04:47.950> two<00:04:48.160> in<00:04:48.480> na

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:49.650 
you are top top to easily top two in na

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:54.300 
you are top top to easily top two in na
thought<00:04:52.350> yeah<00:04:53.350> I<00:04:53.470> mean<00:04:53.620> it's<00:04:53.950> hard<00:04:54.130> to<00:04:54.190> show

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:54.310 
thought yeah I mean it's hard to show

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:55.980 
thought yeah I mean it's hard to show
though<00:04:54.490> because<00:04:54.670> we're<00:04:55.150> doing<00:04:55.270> pretty<00:04:55.690> badly

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:55.990 
though because we're doing pretty badly

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:57.210 
though because we're doing pretty badly
right<00:04:56.140> now<00:04:56.200> I<00:04:56.440> mean<00:04:56.560> obviously<00:04:56.710> we're<00:04:57.010> picking

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:57.220 
right now I mean obviously we're picking

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:59.790 
right now I mean obviously we're picking
it<00:04:57.250> up<00:04:57.370> but<00:04:57.610> I<00:04:57.850> don't<00:04:58.660> know<00:04:58.720> I<00:04:58.780> think<00:04:58.930> with<00:04:59.590> my

00:04:59.790 --> 00:04:59.800 
it up but I don't know I think with my

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:01.800 
it up but I don't know I think with my
past<00:05:00.130> performances<00:05:00.850> you<00:05:01.570> could<00:05:01.690> definitely

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:01.810 
past performances you could definitely

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:05.070 
past performances you could definitely
say<00:05:02.140> that<00:05:02.290> or<00:05:02.950> a<00:05:03.010> tough<00:05:03.370> one<00:05:03.550> or<00:05:03.730> even<00:05:04.080> it's

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:05.080 
say that or a tough one or even it's

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:07.950 
say that or a tough one or even it's
hard<00:05:05.140> to<00:05:05.290> tell<00:05:05.380> it<00:05:05.530> because<00:05:06.090> obviously<00:05:07.090> every

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:07.960 
hard to tell it because obviously every

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:11.250 
hard to tell it because obviously every
team<00:05:08.520> has<00:05:09.520> different<00:05:09.970> strengths<00:05:10.360> like<00:05:10.870> we're

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:11.260 
team has different strengths like we're

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.830 
team has different strengths like we're
really<00:05:11.560> good<00:05:11.740> as<00:05:11.830> a<00:05:11.860> team<00:05:12.040> or<00:05:12.520> you<00:05:12.760> were<00:05:12.910> and

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:13.840 
really good as a team or you were and

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:16.200 
really good as a team or you were and
we're<00:05:14.020> like<00:05:14.140> picking<00:05:14.440> it<00:05:14.530> up<00:05:14.650> and<00:05:14.940> that<00:05:15.940> shows

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:16.210 
we're like picking it up and that shows

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:19.080 
we're like picking it up and that shows
through<00:05:16.450> play<00:05:16.720> and<00:05:17.080> I<00:05:17.440> don't<00:05:17.590> know<00:05:17.680> I<00:05:18.090> only

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:52.500 
develop our own and theory craft a
little<00:05:49.540> bit<00:05:49.630> um<00:05:50.970> well<00:05:51.970> going<00:05:52.090> back<00:05:52.240> to<00:05:52.390> that

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:52.510 
little bit um well going back to that

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:54.300 
little bit um well going back to that
Korea<00:05:53.050> point<00:05:53.350> I<00:05:53.530> think<00:05:53.650> we<00:05:53.920> actually<00:05:54.190> said

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:54.310 
Korea point I think we actually said

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:56.070 
Korea point I think we actually said
that<00:05:54.340> ourselves<00:05:54.520> from<00:05:55.090> this<00:05:55.210> part<00:05:55.480> because<00:05:55.780> we

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:56.080 
that ourselves from this part because we

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:58.620 
that ourselves from this part because we
had<00:05:56.710> told<00:05:57.010> everyone<00:05:57.280> we<00:05:57.520> would<00:05:57.670> watch<00:05:57.790> the<00:05:58.120> OGN

00:05:58.620 --> 00:05:58.630 
had told everyone we would watch the OGN

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:02.220 
had told everyone we would watch the OGN
every<00:05:58.990> night<00:05:59.140> and<00:05:59.670> it<00:06:00.670> was<00:06:00.940> mainly<00:06:01.120> me<00:06:01.990> and

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:02.230 
every night and it was mainly me and

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:04.380 
every night and it was mainly me and
lemon<00:06:02.920> I<00:06:03.100> think<00:06:03.310> I<00:06:03.370> was<00:06:03.490> watching<00:06:03.760> it<00:06:03.880> and<00:06:04.060> we

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:04.390 
lemon I think I was watching it and we

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:06.000 
lemon I think I was watching it and we
like<00:06:04.540> talked<00:06:05.260> about<00:06:05.470> what<00:06:05.560> they<00:06:05.680> were<00:06:05.740> doing

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:06.010 
like talked about what they were doing

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:07.290 
like talked about what they were doing
but<00:06:06.280> I<00:06:06.340> feel<00:06:06.490> like<00:06:06.580> every<00:06:06.790> team<00:06:06.940> doesn't<00:06:07.120> know

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:07.300 
but I feel like every team doesn't know

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:09.960 
but I feel like every team doesn't know
it<00:06:07.390> is<00:06:07.510> they<00:06:07.990> just<00:06:08.170> watch<00:06:08.500> the<00:06:08.800> best<00:06:09.610> players

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:09.970 
it is they just watch the best players

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:12.210 
it is they just watch the best players
and<00:06:10.090> best<00:06:10.510> teams<00:06:10.750> and<00:06:11.080> kind<00:06:11.800> of<00:06:11.860> just<00:06:12.040> see<00:06:12.130> what

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:12.220 
and best teams and kind of just see what

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:14.880 
and best teams and kind of just see what
they're<00:06:12.310> doing<00:06:12.580> is<00:06:12.700> like<00:06:12.850> a<00:06:12.880> basis<00:06:13.450> as<00:06:13.660> to<00:06:13.890> what

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:14.890 
they're doing is like a basis as to what

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:16.410 
they're doing is like a basis as to what
they're<00:06:15.100> gonna<00:06:15.190> do<00:06:15.340> in<00:06:15.430> scrims<00:06:15.670> so<00:06:16.240> if<00:06:16.330> they

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:18.630 
they're gonna do in scrims so if they
see<00:06:16.480> something<00:06:16.870> new<00:06:17.020> like<00:06:17.380> I<00:06:17.650> don't<00:06:18.310> know

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:24.190 
good and they try it out in scrims and

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:26.850 
good and they try it out in scrims and
you<00:06:24.250> just<00:06:24.400> see<00:06:24.900> why<00:06:25.900> it's<00:06:26.140> good<00:06:26.350> or<00:06:26.560> why<00:06:26.710> they

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:26.860 
you just see why it's good or why they

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:28.230 
you just see why it's good or why they
played<00:06:27.070> it<00:06:27.220> and<00:06:27.430> and<00:06:27.670> just<00:06:27.820> stuff<00:06:27.940> like<00:06:27.970> that

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:28.240 
played it and and just stuff like that

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:31.830 
played it and and just stuff like that
it's<00:06:28.420> kind<00:06:28.570> of<00:06:28.600> all<00:06:29.130> the<00:06:30.130> OGN<00:06:30.940> does<00:06:31.090> for<00:06:31.420> anyone

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:31.840 
it's kind of all the OGN does for anyone

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:33.420 
it's kind of all the OGN does for anyone
and<00:06:32.050> na<00:06:32.470> and<00:06:32.740> i<00:06:32.770> think<00:06:32.950> everyone<00:06:33.100> does<00:06:33.250> that

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:33.430 
and na and i think everyone does that

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:36.900 
and na and i think everyone does that
but<00:06:33.730> i<00:06:34.440> think<00:06:35.440> for<00:06:35.680> our<00:06:35.860> own<00:06:36.010> style<00:06:36.490> of<00:06:36.730> being

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:36.910 
but i think for our own style of being

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:38.610 
but i think for our own style of being
created<00:06:37.240> I<00:06:37.450> don't<00:06:38.110> know<00:06:38.170> we've<00:06:38.290> kind<00:06:38.380> of<00:06:38.470> had

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:38.620 
created I don't know we've kind of had

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:41.750 
created I don't know we've kind of had
the<00:06:38.710> same<00:06:38.740> style<00:06:39.070> it's<00:06:39.940> more<00:06:40.180> of<00:06:40.240> just<00:06:40.270> about

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:41.760 
the same style it's more of just about

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:44.760 
the same style it's more of just about
finding<00:06:42.760> the<00:06:42.970> best<00:06:43.000> way<00:06:43.240> to<00:06:43.360> win<00:06:43.540> the<00:06:43.630> game<00:06:43.770> for

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:44.770 
finding the best way to win the game for

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:46.860 
finding the best way to win the game for
us<00:06:44.800> and<00:06:45.160> I<00:06:45.610> don't<00:06:45.670> really<00:06:45.850> it's<00:06:46.630> hard

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:46.870 
us and I don't really it's hard

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:48.660 
us and I don't really it's hard
identify<00:06:47.230> that<00:06:47.260> myself<00:06:47.740> because<00:06:48.310> I<00:06:48.460> kind<00:06:48.640> of

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:48.670 
identify that myself because I kind of

00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:50.160 
identify that myself because I kind of
just<00:06:48.820> played<00:06:49.060> the<00:06:49.150> game<00:06:49.300> and<00:06:49.870> I<00:06:49.930> don't<00:06:50.050> really

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:50.170 
just played the game and I don't really

00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:52.080 
just played the game and I don't really
think<00:06:50.230> about<00:06:50.800> like<00:06:51.010> what<00:06:51.310> we're<00:06:51.550> specifically

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:52.090 
think about like what we're specifically

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:54.690 
think about like what we're specifically
doing<00:06:52.360> and<00:06:53.200> I<00:06:53.350> think<00:06:53.620> almost<00:06:54.070> everyone<00:06:54.400> should

00:06:54.690 --> 00:06:54.700 
doing and I think almost everyone should

00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:57.390 
doing and I think almost everyone should
be<00:06:54.790> playing<00:06:55.120> pretty<00:06:55.780> similarly<00:06:56.440> other<00:06:57.070> than

00:06:57.390 --> 00:06:57.400 
be playing pretty similarly other than

00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:59.850 
be playing pretty similarly other than
champions<00:06:57.940> I<00:06:58.120> guess<00:06:58.330> because<00:06:58.590> maybe<00:06:59.590> some

00:06:59.850 --> 00:06:59.860 
champions I guess because maybe some

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:00.990 
champions I guess because maybe some
people<00:06:59.980> have<00:07:00.130> a<00:07:00.190> harder<00:07:00.400> time<00:07:00.430> playing<00:07:00.790> some

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:01.000 
people have a harder time playing some

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.670 
people have a harder time playing some
champions<00:07:01.420> they<00:07:01.630> just<00:07:01.780> don't<00:07:02.290> like<00:07:02.500> playing

00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:02.680 
champions they just don't like playing

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:05.610 
champions they just don't like playing
that<00:07:02.920> champion<00:07:03.400> and<00:07:03.990> past<00:07:04.990> that<00:07:05.170> I<00:07:05.200> think<00:07:05.350> the

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:05.620 
that champion and past that I think the

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:07.860 
that champion and past that I think the
same<00:07:05.800> wind<00:07:06.460> condition<00:07:06.910> is<00:07:07.060> the<00:07:07.570> same<00:07:07.750> for

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:07.870 
same wind condition is the same for

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:10.290 
same wind condition is the same for
everyone<00:07:08.550> fair<00:07:09.550> enough<00:07:09.700> fair<00:07:09.760> enough

00:07:10.290 --> 00:07:10.300 
everyone fair enough fair enough

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:15.960 
everyone fair enough fair enough
