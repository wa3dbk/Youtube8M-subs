cards from the top of the deck usually -
okay<00:00:15.780> this<00:00:16.260> is<00:00:16.440> usually<00:00:16.949> used<00:00:17.340> as<00:00:17.490> a<00:00:17.550> get<00:00:17.820> ready

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
okay this is usually used as a get ready

okay this is usually used as a get ready
for<00:00:18.449> the<00:00:19.199> double<00:00:19.500> lift<00:00:19.760> now<00:00:20.760> this<00:00:21.119> is<00:00:21.300> a<00:00:21.330> more

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
for the double lift now this is a more

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.359 
for the double lift now this is a more
advanced<00:00:22.410> way<00:00:22.529> of<00:00:22.680> doing<00:00:22.949> it<00:00:23.100> it<00:00:23.220> requires

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
advanced way of doing it it requires

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:29.179 
advanced way of doing it it requires
quite<00:00:23.939> a<00:00:24.000> bit<00:00:24.090> of<00:00:25.490> pinkie<00:00:26.490> strength<00:00:27.090> and<00:00:28.189> you

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
quite a bit of pinkie strength and you

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:30.710 
quite a bit of pinkie strength and you
really<00:00:29.730> need<00:00:29.880> to<00:00:29.970> be<00:00:30.029> able<00:00:30.119> to<00:00:30.210> control<00:00:30.570> the

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
really need to be able to control the

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.450 
really need to be able to control the
tension<00:00:30.960> and<00:00:31.320> the<00:00:31.380> cards<00:00:31.710> in<00:00:31.859> your<00:00:31.890> hand<00:00:31.980> very

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
tension and the cards in your hand very

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.430 
tension and the cards in your hand very
well<00:00:32.700> to<00:00:32.880> be<00:00:32.969> able<00:00:33.030> to<00:00:33.180> do<00:00:33.329> this<00:00:33.480> but<00:00:34.140> it<00:00:34.260> has

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
well to be able to do this but it has

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:35.810 
well to be able to do this but it has
the<00:00:34.620> obvious<00:00:35.010> advantage<00:00:35.430> of<00:00:35.579> being

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
the obvious advantage of being

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.600 
the obvious advantage of being
one-handed<00:00:36.780> right<00:00:37.680> so<00:00:38.129> normally<00:00:38.430> when<00:00:38.550> you

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
one-handed right so normally when you

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.660 
one-handed right so normally when you
first<00:00:39.170> learn<00:00:40.170> card<00:00:40.530> magic<00:00:40.710> in<00:00:41.129> order<00:00:41.430> to<00:00:41.550> get

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
first learn card magic in order to get

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.010 
first learn card magic in order to get
your<00:00:41.760> break<00:00:41.969> what<00:00:42.149> you<00:00:42.270> do<00:00:42.420> is<00:00:42.540> you<00:00:42.660> come<00:00:42.840> over

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
your break what you do is you come over

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.110 
your break what you do is you come over
with<00:00:43.410> your<00:00:43.530> opposite<00:00:43.950> hand<00:00:44.129> and<00:00:44.340> then<00:00:44.430> you

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
with your opposite hand and then you

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.090 
with your opposite hand and then you
riffle<00:00:45.539> along<00:00:46.079> the<00:00:46.230> back<00:00:46.410> edge<00:00:46.649> of<00:00:46.770> the<00:00:46.890> deck

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
riffle along the back edge of the deck

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.979 
riffle along the back edge of the deck
until<00:00:47.309> you<00:00:47.520> have<00:00:47.610> two<00:00:47.760> cards<00:00:48.000> remaining<00:00:48.360> and

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
until you have two cards remaining and

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.500 
until you have two cards remaining and
you<00:00:49.110> stick<00:00:49.379> your<00:00:49.500> pinky<00:00:49.860> in<00:00:50.010> and<00:00:50.250> you<00:00:51.210> get<00:00:51.360> your

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
you stick your pinky in and you get your

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.150 
you stick your pinky in and you get your
break<00:00:51.690> that<00:00:51.870> way<00:00:52.050> and<00:00:52.469> that's<00:00:52.649> a<00:00:52.829> that's<00:00:53.070> a

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
break that way and that's a that's a

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.380 
break that way and that's a that's a
fine<00:00:53.370> way<00:00:53.399> of<00:00:53.550> doing<00:00:53.879> it<00:00:53.969> there's<00:00:54.120> nothing

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
fine way of doing it there's nothing

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:54.889 
fine way of doing it there's nothing
wrong<00:00:54.510> with<00:00:54.570> that

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
wrong with that

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.560 
wrong with that
but<00:00:55.620> for<00:00:55.920> your<00:00:56.190> more<00:00:56.399> advanced<00:00:56.910> card<00:00:57.180> guys<00:00:57.360> out

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
but for your more advanced card guys out

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.099 
but for your more advanced card guys out
there<00:00:57.980> you<00:00:58.980> might<00:00:59.190> want<00:00:59.430> to<00:00:59.609> learn<00:00:59.850> the<00:01:00.210> pinkie

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
there you might want to learn the pinkie

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:02.869 
there you might want to learn the pinkie
count<00:01:01.289> because<00:01:01.710> it<00:01:01.949> just<00:01:02.129> cleans<00:01:02.520> up<00:01:02.730> your

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
count because it just cleans up your

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.899 
count because it just cleans up your
card<00:01:03.090> handling<00:01:03.589> all<00:01:04.589> right<00:01:04.739> and<00:01:04.949> I<00:01:05.729> should

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
card handling all right and I should

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.700 
card handling all right and I should
mention<00:01:06.030> that<00:01:06.210> it<00:01:06.479> can<00:01:06.659> be<00:01:07.020> used<00:01:07.320> to<00:01:07.470> count

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
mention that it can be used to count

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.399 
mention that it can be used to count
more<00:01:07.860> than<00:01:08.040> two<00:01:08.159> cards<00:01:08.460> you<00:01:08.670> can<00:01:09.119> do<00:01:09.210> two<00:01:09.659> three

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
more than two cards you can do two three

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.850 
more than two cards you can do two three
four<00:01:11.159> five<00:01:11.700> six<00:01:12.240> seven<00:01:12.810> it<00:01:13.409> really<00:01:13.650> just

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
four five six seven it really just

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.450 
four five six seven it really just
depends<00:01:14.250> on<00:01:14.430> how<00:01:14.640> much<00:01:14.850> you<00:01:15.299> want<00:01:15.689> to<00:01:15.780> practice

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:16.460 
depends on how much you want to practice

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.120 
depends on how much you want to practice
right<00:01:17.460> but<00:01:18.240> in<00:01:18.360> most<00:01:18.540> cases<00:01:18.689> you<00:01:19.350> will<00:01:19.979> be

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
right but in most cases you will be

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.300 
right but in most cases you will be
using<00:01:20.490> it<00:01:20.580> for<00:01:20.729> just<00:01:21.060> two<00:01:21.240> cards<00:01:21.710> so<00:01:22.710> let's

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
using it for just two cards so let's

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.060 
using it for just two cards so let's
talk<00:01:23.460> about<00:01:23.520> how<00:01:23.970> to<00:01:24.720> do<00:01:24.840> this<00:01:25.020> you're<00:01:25.950> going

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
talk about how to do this you're going

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.740 
talk about how to do this you're going
to<00:01:26.130> hold<00:01:26.250> your<00:01:26.549> deck<00:01:26.729> in<00:01:27.030> your<00:01:27.360> mechanics<00:01:27.810> grip

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:29.750 
to hold your deck in your mechanics grip

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:32.990 
to hold your deck in your mechanics grip
there's<00:01:30.750> two<00:01:31.049> key<00:01:31.409> finger<00:01:31.979> positions<00:01:32.430> your

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
fingers they don't matter as much so you

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.090

that<00:01:51.960> now<00:01:52.140> there's<00:01:52.380> a<00:01:52.439> slant<00:01:53.689> you<00:01:54.689> see<00:01:54.869> that

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
that now there's a slant you see that

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.319 
that now there's a slant you see that
and<00:01:55.290> when<00:01:56.219> you're<00:01:56.310> first<00:01:56.460> starting<00:01:56.820> out<00:01:56.909> you

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
and when you're first starting out you

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:00.219 
and when you're first starting out you
might<00:01:58.320> need<00:01:58.530> to<00:01:58.710> have<00:01:58.860> a<00:01:58.890> really<00:01:59.250> big<00:01:59.520> slant<00:01:59.880> as

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:00.229 
might need to have a really big slant as

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:03.080 
might need to have a really big slant as
you<00:02:01.229> practice<00:02:01.439> more<00:02:01.710> more<00:02:02.189> that<00:02:02.430> slant<00:02:02.820> will

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
you practice more more that slant will

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.240 
you practice more more that slant will
decrease<00:02:03.509> so<00:02:03.689> right<00:02:03.930> now<00:02:04.049> I<00:02:04.079> I<00:02:04.560> do<00:02:04.770> the<00:02:04.979> pinkie

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
decrease so right now I I do the pinkie

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.520 
decrease so right now I I do the pinkie
count<00:02:05.490> with<00:02:06.479> a<00:02:06.509> bevel<00:02:07.140> of<00:02:07.259> about<00:02:07.530> that<00:02:07.860> much

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.530 
count with a bevel of about that much

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:10.950 
count with a bevel of about that much
and<00:02:08.679> that's<00:02:08.830> that's<00:02:09.399> where<00:02:09.640> I<00:02:09.670> do<00:02:09.789> it<00:02:10.030> but<00:02:10.869> when

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:10.960 
and that's that's where I do it but when

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:12.660 
and that's that's where I do it but when
you're<00:02:11.020> first<00:02:11.170> starting<00:02:11.530> out<00:02:11.650> use<00:02:12.190> a<00:02:12.220> really

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
you're first starting out use a really

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:14.460 
you're first starting out use a really
exaggerated<00:02:13.330> bevel<00:02:13.750> and<00:02:13.960> that<00:02:14.110> will<00:02:14.290> just

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470 
exaggerated bevel and that will just

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:17.130 
exaggerated bevel and that will just
help<00:02:14.710> you<00:02:14.800> understand<00:02:15.370> how<00:02:16.270> how<00:02:16.780> this<00:02:16.990> is

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
help you understand how how this is

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.800 
help you understand how how this is
working<00:02:17.550> so<00:02:18.550> something<00:02:18.910> like<00:02:18.940> this<00:02:19.270> and<00:02:19.540> to

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
working so something like this and to

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:21.240 
working so something like this and to
get<00:02:19.960> that<00:02:20.080> babble<00:02:20.410> all<00:02:20.530> I'm<00:02:20.680> doing<00:02:20.980> is<00:02:21.070> I'm

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
get that babble all I'm doing is I'm

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:24.860 
get that babble all I'm doing is I'm
pushing<00:02:21.790> with<00:02:22.150> my<00:02:22.180> pinky<00:02:22.630> to<00:02:23.320> the<00:02:23.440> left<00:02:23.710> and

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
pushing with my pinky to the left and

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.630 
pushing with my pinky to the left and
that<00:02:25.870> is<00:02:26.140> making<00:02:26.500> the<00:02:26.709> cards<00:02:26.980> Bend<00:02:27.310> like<00:02:27.580> that

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
that is making the cards Bend like that

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:32.250 
that is making the cards Bend like that
and<00:02:28.060> to<00:02:28.720> get<00:02:28.900> that<00:02:29.110> angle<00:02:29.740> into<00:02:30.640> the<00:02:30.730> edge<00:02:31.260> so

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
and to get that angle into the edge so

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:33.180 
and to get that angle into the edge so
now<00:02:32.380> what<00:02:32.560> you're<00:02:32.620> going<00:02:32.770> to<00:02:32.800> do<00:02:32.980> is<00:02:33.070> you're

card of the deck all right at this point

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:48.390 
card of the deck all right at this point
you're<00:02:47.110> going<00:02:47.140> to<00:02:47.260> push<00:02:47.709> down<00:02:47.739> with<00:02:48.310> your

thumb and then you're going to pull down
with<00:02:51.370> your<00:02:51.520> pinky<00:02:51.850> like<00:02:52.540> this<00:02:52.830> you're<00:02:53.830> going

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
with your pinky like this you're going

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:56.460 
with your pinky like this you're going

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
to do that the same time and that

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:58.560 
to do that the same time and that
creates<00:02:56.890> tension<00:02:56.980> and<00:02:57.489> it<00:02:57.820> causes<00:02:58.000> the<00:02:58.270> cards

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:58.570 
creates tension and it causes the cards

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:03.240 
creates tension and it causes the cards
to<00:02:59.110> bend<00:03:01.080> very<00:03:02.080> minutely<00:03:02.680> but<00:03:03.130> it's

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
to bend very minutely but it's

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.970 
to bend very minutely but it's
definitely<00:03:03.430> noticeable<00:03:04.320> okay<00:03:05.320> so<00:03:05.860> this

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:05.980 
definitely noticeable okay so this

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:08.130 
definitely noticeable okay so this
creates<00:03:06.310> a<00:03:06.370> lot<00:03:06.520> of<00:03:06.550> tension<00:03:07.060> and<00:03:07.209> then<00:03:07.510> you're

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
creates a lot of tension and then you're

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:10.710 
creates a lot of tension and then you're
going<00:03:08.260> to<00:03:08.350> slowly<00:03:09.010> release<00:03:09.580> the<00:03:09.610> tension<00:03:10.180> with

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
going to slowly release the tension with

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.990 
going to slowly release the tension with
your<00:03:10.840> pinky<00:03:11.230> until<00:03:12.130> the<00:03:12.340> top<00:03:12.549> card<00:03:12.820> of<00:03:12.910> the
