00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:51.760 
been experimenting with what fits and
things<00:05:49.910> like<00:05:50.030> that<00:05:50.090> so<00:05:50.480> it's<00:05:51.170> just<00:05:51.320> hung<00:05:51.500> up<00:05:51.620> on

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:51.770 
things like that so it's just hung up on

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:53.050 
things like that so it's just hung up on
the<00:05:51.830> split<00:05:52.010> right<00:05:52.190> now<00:05:52.340> but<00:05:52.820> it's<00:05:52.910> definitely

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:53.060 
the split right now but it's definitely

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:55.750 
the split right now but it's definitely
really<00:05:53.300> cool<00:05:53.420> um<00:05:53.840> I<00:05:54.740> haven't<00:05:55.280> had<00:05:55.340> something

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:55.760 
really cool um I haven't had something

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:57.310 
really cool um I haven't had something
like<00:05:55.880> this<00:05:56.030> and<00:05:56.270> it's<00:05:56.810> definitely<00:05:57.140> going<00:05:57.260> to

00:05:57.310 --> 00:05:57.320 
like this and it's definitely going to

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:59.230 
like this and it's definitely going to
be<00:05:57.380> a<00:05:57.440> lot<00:05:57.650> easier<00:05:57.680> to<00:05:58.460> just<00:05:58.640> pull<00:05:58.820> string<00:05:59.120> off

00:05:59.230 --> 00:05:59.240 
be a lot easier to just pull string off

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:05.290 
be a lot easier to just pull string off
of<00:06:01.120> so<00:06:02.120> yeah<00:06:02.330> that's<00:06:02.510> about<00:06:02.690> it<00:06:03.850> it's<00:06:04.850> taking

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:05.300 
of so yeah that's about it it's taking

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:07.390 
of so yeah that's about it it's taking
up<00:06:05.390> pretty<00:06:05.540> much<00:06:05.720> half<00:06:06.050> of<00:06:06.200> my<00:06:06.410> basement<00:06:06.920> as<00:06:07.070> of

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:07.400 
up pretty much half of my basement as of

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:10.450 
up pretty much half of my basement as of
right<00:06:07.430> now<00:06:08.380> definitely<00:06:09.380> really<00:06:09.950> a<00:06:09.980> lot<00:06:10.340> better

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:10.460 
right now definitely really a lot better

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:12.370 
right now definitely really a lot better
