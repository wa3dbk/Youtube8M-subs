of<00:03:01.170> the<00:03:01.200> past<00:03:01.470> few<00:03:01.680> months<00:03:01.890> and<00:03:02.280> I<00:03:02.940> don't<00:03:03.270> feel

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
of the past few months and I don't feel

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:04.970 
of the past few months and I don't feel
like<00:03:03.630> it's<00:03:03.810> like<00:03:03.989> the<00:03:04.140> best<00:03:04.320> song<00:03:04.590> on<00:03:04.800> the

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
like it's like the best song on the

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:06.350 
like it's like the best song on the
album<00:03:05.010> or<00:03:05.400> anything<00:03:05.700> like<00:03:05.730> that<00:03:05.880> but<00:03:06.209> I<00:03:06.269> think

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
album or anything like that but I think

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.870 
album or anything like that but I think
it's<00:03:06.600> very<00:03:06.810> strong<00:03:07.140> single<00:03:07.620> now<00:03:08.130> what<00:03:08.550> I<00:03:08.580> would

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
it's very strong single now what I would

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:10.400 
it's very strong single now what I would
have<00:03:08.910> gone<00:03:09.120> with<00:03:09.180> for<00:03:09.720> the<00:03:09.810> first<00:03:10.019> single

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
have gone with for the first single

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:12.800 
have gone with for the first single
would<00:03:10.590> be<00:03:10.709> mean<00:03:10.980> spirits<00:03:11.489> I<00:03:11.700> feel<00:03:12.300> like<00:03:12.450> that

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
would be mean spirits I feel like that

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.560 
would be mean spirits I feel like that
song<00:03:13.200> is<00:03:13.410> reminiscent<00:03:13.950> of<00:03:14.040> panic<00:03:14.430> switch<00:03:14.670> now

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:15.570 
song is reminiscent of panic switch now

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:17.900 
song is reminiscent of panic switch now
not<00:03:16.080> as<00:03:16.319> great<00:03:16.680> Hispanic<00:03:17.040> switch<00:03:17.370> off<00:03:17.610> of<00:03:17.790> the

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
not as great Hispanic switch off of the

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:19.970 
not as great Hispanic switch off of the
album<00:03:18.090> swoon<00:03:18.569> but<00:03:18.810> still<00:03:19.170> it's<00:03:19.380> a<00:03:19.500> very<00:03:19.739> good

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
album swoon but still it's a very good

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.699 
album swoon but still it's a very good
song<00:03:20.190> and<00:03:20.459> I<00:03:20.489> think<00:03:20.850> it<00:03:20.940> channels<00:03:21.390> it<00:03:21.560> no<00:03:22.560> music

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
song and I think it channels it no music

song and I think it channels it no music
