 It was my girlfriend who gave it to me. 

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:34.350
 that my girlfriend one day she will be 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.390

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:42.480
 I'll tell you a little bit about mine. 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.340
 experience with this book when it was 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.530
 announced that this book was coming to the 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.870
 brazil through the galera record label 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.210
 I got a flea behind my ear 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.160
 Yes, because the name did not call me much. 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.989
 Attention knows the book of the writer of 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.149
 harry potter i thought it would be kind 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.399
 fantastic animals and where there is only one 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.530
 that illustrated is not really connected 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.530
 not go out searching the book but the 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.509
 my first impression was this 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:08.190
 initially did not support I thought 

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:10.380
 steam that fantastic animals and inhabit 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:12.420
 going out to the movies I want to get a 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.610
 way to torq the maximum amount of money 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.250
 possible but later when the book came out 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.619
 and such I saw people in video images 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.119
 showing and expensive the book is sensational and 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.160
 if one day I was at home and mine 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.110
 girlfriend just showed up with this 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:27.539
 that proves us right for me at her 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.490
 and the book's faces are very good is very good 

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:31.950
 He really is very handsome. 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.080
 exactly the same size as the movie 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.929

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:38.729

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:40.950

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:08.109

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:16.780
 I even managed to turn the problem, but this 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:19.599
 It's here in Portuguese so I can 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:22.180
 enjoy it to the maximum there is something 

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:24.849
 Here, too, it comes as if 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:27.459
 It was a letter, I'll open it for you. 

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:30.220

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:32.410
 galley is a bestiary according to the 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:34.629
 prescribed here and hence has a 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:36.819
 of the Norwegian super state is the race of the 

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:39.160
 new berto is brings a dementor is from 

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:41.169
 I will be a basilisk year I like it very much 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:43.569
 legal and protocol do not know in your door 

00:03:41.169 --> 00:03:46.239
 on the bathroom wall is very cool 

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:48.609
 same type and then a little 

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:49.959
 same structure of the film even go 

00:03:48.609 --> 00:03:51.790
 who does not know is a book that has a 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:53.319
 mount of brindisi the type of maroto 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:55.269

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:58.000
 showing this book click here and 

00:03:55.269 --> 00:04:00.549
 Watch now my friend, anyway, following 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.669
 a little this reasoning it comes here the 

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:06.400
 The owls emporium is a little book to 

00:04:03.669 --> 00:04:08.229
 next part it shows all cross that 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:11.470
 already appeared there from the movie of harry 

00:04:08.229 --> 00:04:13.329
 very cool potter even ball show a 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:15.760
 Only thing I have so let's go 

00:04:13.329 --> 00:04:18.400
 to say against this book is that it 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:21.400
 really repeats enough information from the 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:23.979
 film easy edu fish of the screen and 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:25.870
 it's not a book let's say it 's exclusive to 

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:28.120
 most of the images that 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:30.190
 of this book also exist within the 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:31.900
 magic of the cinema and the pages for 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:33.940
 negative dot and stop screen 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:36.490
 but really have some new things to 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:38.680
 some new things but most have already 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:41.169
 There is a fun movie screen then 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:43.479
 a tip and if it has already flowed from 

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:45.039
 Beijing, wait a minute, you do not have to pick up 

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:47.380
 and now you will not have so much information 

00:04:45.039 --> 00:04:49.360
 optional extra so you can compete with 

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:50.919
 Fluid players also know all that 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:52.630
 In this book, this book is even more 

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:54.669
 to have a collection like this to put the 

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:56.590
 scenery to put the handsome 

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:58.600
 Your wall is such a beautiful book. 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:01.300
 even with that purple color I recommend 

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:03.100
 enough for you to take this book is 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:05.440
 collect beauty and now a news 

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:07.900
 also there about this book that the 

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:09.280
 publisher rapp collins that as I said to 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:11.680
 publisher of this book they 

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:14.470
 announced that this year yes this year 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:16.690
 2015 will be with his follow up of him 

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:19.120
 he's going to call himself a medical harry potter or 

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:21.190
 places we promise that in the free translation 

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:22.630
 Harry Potter's magical places of 

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:24.370
 movies then we'll know 

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:25.690
 basically everything is about how it was the 

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:27.400
 construction of works as was the 

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:29.229
 rocksmith diagonal alley building 

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:31.840
 of several places not knowing enough 

00:05:29.229 --> 00:05:33.669
 about the locations of the films and all 

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:36.220
 these stops a bit of the scenery too 

00:05:33.669 --> 00:05:38.169
 there mec books is the studio that all 

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:38.590
 harry potter series was filmed by warner 

00:05:38.169 --> 00:05:40.630
 bros 

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:42.760
 So save some money my friend because 

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:44.800
 most likely the publisher galera 

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:46.750
 record will also bring this book to 

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:48.070
 here this year or at least let's hope 

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:49.990
 because it's probably going to be a book 

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:51.580
 much of the time 

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:53.139
 it's not about the book that I had to 

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:54.699
