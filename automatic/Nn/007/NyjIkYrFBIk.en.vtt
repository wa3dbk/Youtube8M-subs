00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:17.200 
the cons now its biggest con is the

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.389 
the cons now its biggest con is the
tight<00:01:17.679> geometry<00:01:18.369> on<00:01:18.490> it<00:01:18.720> downhill<00:01:19.720> and<00:01:20.399> it's

00:01:21.389 --> 00:01:21.399 
tight geometry on it downhill and it's

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:23.580 
tight geometry on it downhill and it's
not<00:01:21.580> a<00:01:21.789> very<00:01:21.880> comfortable<00:01:22.390> bike<00:01:22.869> to<00:01:23.080> downhill

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:23.590 
not a very comfortable bike to downhill

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:25.770 
not a very comfortable bike to downhill
on<00:01:23.709> obviously<00:01:24.369> slowly<00:01:25.149> because<00:01:25.479> you<00:01:25.600> feel

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:25.780 
on obviously slowly because you feel

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:27.960 
on obviously slowly because you feel
like<00:01:25.810> with<00:01:26.799> it<00:01:26.950> being<00:01:27.159> a<00:01:27.220> little<00:01:27.250> bit<00:01:27.459> on<00:01:27.640> nose

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:27.970 
like with it being a little bit on nose

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:29.190 
like with it being a little bit on nose
heavier<00:01:28.330> you<00:01:28.630> know<00:01:28.690> on<00:01:28.780> that<00:01:28.929> tighter

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:29.200 
heavier you know on that tighter

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.499 
heavier you know on that tighter
geometry<00:01:30.009> you<00:01:30.429> got<00:01:30.640> your<00:01:30.819> weight<00:01:31.030> forward<00:01:31.360> on

00:01:31.499 --> 00:01:31.509 
geometry you got your weight forward on

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:33.480 
geometry you got your weight forward on
the<00:01:31.690> bike<00:01:31.869> so<00:01:32.200> you<00:01:32.530> know<00:01:32.830> it's<00:01:32.979> not<00:01:33.190> a

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:33.490 
the bike so you know it's not a

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:35.789 
the bike so you know it's not a
confident<00:01:34.420> feeling<00:01:34.720> going<00:01:34.929> downhill<00:01:35.289> so<00:01:35.590> a

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:35.799 
confident feeling going downhill so a

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:37.350 
confident feeling going downhill so a
lot<00:01:36.039> of<00:01:36.159> that's<00:01:36.280> going<00:01:36.399> to<00:01:36.459> be<00:01:36.549> based<00:01:36.759> on<00:01:36.940> skill

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:37.360 
lot of that's going to be based on skill

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:40.859 
lot of that's going to be based on skill
rider<00:01:38.110> or<00:01:38.470> a<00:01:38.530> skill<00:01:38.979> level<00:01:39.340> of<00:01:39.490> the<00:01:39.729> rider<00:01:39.970> for

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:40.869 
rider or a skill level of the rider for

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:43.289 
rider or a skill level of the rider for
me<00:01:41.080> I'm<00:01:41.350> not<00:01:41.770> a<00:01:41.799> great<00:01:42.100> downhiller<00:01:42.700> although<00:01:43.270> I

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:43.299 
me I'm not a great downhiller although I

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:45.149 
me I'm not a great downhiller although I
don't<00:01:43.450> think<00:01:43.659> I'm<00:01:43.929> a<00:01:43.959> weak<00:01:44.259> downhiller<00:01:44.770> by<00:01:44.979> any

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:45.159 
don't think I'm a weak downhiller by any

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:46.979 
don't think I'm a weak downhiller by any
means<00:01:45.429> and<00:01:45.670> it<00:01:46.090> did<00:01:46.269> scare<00:01:46.599> me<00:01:46.629> from

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:46.989 
means and it did scare me from

00:01:46.989 --> 00:01:49.710 
means and it did scare me from
time-to-time<00:01:47.229> downhill<00:01:48.160> in<00:01:48.280> another<00:01:49.119> area<00:01:49.569> I

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:49.720 
time-to-time downhill in another area I

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.309 
time-to-time downhill in another area I
think<00:01:50.170> the<00:01:50.349> tires<00:01:50.679> for<00:01:51.099> this<00:01:51.280> particular<00:01:51.610> bike

00:01:52.309 --> 00:01:52.319 
think the tires for this particular bike

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:55.050 
think the tires for this particular bike
probably<00:01:53.319> not<00:01:53.530> the<00:01:53.920> best<00:01:54.190> of<00:01:54.459> choice<00:01:54.729> for<00:01:54.940> an

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060 
probably not the best of choice for an

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:56.430 
probably not the best of choice for an
all-around<00:01:55.390> mountain<00:01:55.840> bike<00:01:55.989> because<00:01:56.319> it

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:56.440 
all-around mountain bike because it

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:58.139 
all-around mountain bike because it
really<00:01:56.739> takes<00:01:57.039> away<00:01:57.160> from<00:01:57.310> this<00:01:57.580> bike<00:01:57.729> it's

00:01:58.139 --> 00:01:58.149 
really takes away from this bike it's

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:01.380 
really takes away from this bike it's
great<00:01:58.539> on<00:01:58.860> specific<00:01:59.860> terrain<00:02:00.729> you<00:02:01.119> know<00:02:01.209> that

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:01.390 
great on specific terrain you know that

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:03.419 
great on specific terrain you know that
the<00:02:01.509> tire<00:02:01.720> was<00:02:01.959> designed<00:02:02.410> to<00:02:02.530> do<00:02:02.739> hard<00:02:03.129> pack

00:02:03.419 --> 00:02:03.429 
the tire was designed to do hard pack

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:05.940 
the tire was designed to do hard pack
however<00:02:04.239> you<00:02:04.569> get<00:02:04.720> in<00:02:04.869> any<00:02:05.050> other<00:02:05.289> condition

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:05.950 
however you get in any other condition

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:08.040 
however you get in any other condition
doesn't<00:02:06.489> do<00:02:06.819> too<00:02:07.030> well<00:02:07.060> in<00:02:07.330> it<00:02:07.450> it<00:02:07.720> actually

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.050 
doesn't do too well in it it actually

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:33.560 
doesn't do too well in it it actually
takes<00:02:08.289> away<00:02:08.590> from<00:02:08.619> the<00:02:08.950> bikes<00:02:09.160> ability

ultimately who will do I think this bike
is<00:02:36.000> for<00:02:36.209> I<00:02:36.270> think<00:02:36.750> it's<00:02:36.930> for<00:02:37.170> the<00:02:37.410> beginning

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
know somebody with a little bit more

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:57.350 
know somebody with a little bit more
experience<00:02:55.950> that<00:02:56.160> you<00:02:56.520> know<00:02:56.610> knows<00:02:57.030> our<00:02:57.209> way

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
experience that you know knows our way

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.120

around the trail and really wants to go
after<00:02:59.310> it<00:02:59.580> okay<00:03:00.540> so<00:03:00.720> I<00:03:01.250> guess<00:03:02.250> the<00:03:02.370> next<00:03:02.550> part

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:02.820 
after it okay so I guess the next part

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:06.260 
after it okay so I guess the next part
is<00:03:02.970> we<00:03:03.900> talked<00:03:04.220> you<00:03:05.220> know<00:03:05.310> we<00:03:05.430> feel<00:03:05.880> like<00:03:05.940> all

is we talked you know we feel like all

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:08.540 
is we talked you know we feel like all
these<00:03:06.450> bikes<00:03:06.630> are<00:03:06.840> good<00:03:06.989> to<00:03:07.080> upgrade<00:03:07.470> you<00:03:08.430> know

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:08.550 
these bikes are good to upgrade you know

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:10.040 
these bikes are good to upgrade you know
they're<00:03:08.760> all<00:03:08.880> all<00:03:09.270> the<00:03:09.420> frames<00:03:09.660> are<00:03:09.840> pretty

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:10.050 
they're all all the frames are pretty

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:12.020 
they're all all the frames are pretty
good<00:03:10.230> you<00:03:11.040> know<00:03:11.070> as<00:03:11.370> long<00:03:11.520> as<00:03:11.640> you<00:03:11.760> like<00:03:11.910> the

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
good you know as long as you like the

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:15.110 
good you know as long as you like the
geometry<00:03:13.010> so<00:03:14.010> what's<00:03:14.250> the<00:03:14.430> part<00:03:14.670> on<00:03:14.880> it<00:03:15.030> you

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
geometry so what's the part on it you

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:16.640 
geometry so what's the part on it you
felt<00:03:15.360> was<00:03:15.510> the<00:03:15.600> weakest<00:03:15.930> and<00:03:16.140> the<00:03:16.260> first<00:03:16.470> thing

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
felt was the weakest and the first thing

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:18.560 
felt was the weakest and the first thing
you<00:03:16.770> would<00:03:16.830> get<00:03:17.010> rid<00:03:17.190> of<00:03:17.310> all<00:03:17.880> right<00:03:18.000> on<00:03:18.180> this

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570 
you would get rid of all right on this

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:20.240 
you would get rid of all right on this
particular<00:03:18.959> bike<00:03:19.410> the<00:03:19.560> first<00:03:19.799> thing<00:03:20.040> that<00:03:20.220> I

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
particular bike the first thing that I

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:21.949 
particular bike the first thing that I
would<00:03:20.370> get<00:03:20.640> rid<00:03:20.880> of<00:03:21.030> or<00:03:21.239> that<00:03:21.390> I<00:03:21.450> thought<00:03:21.750> was

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
would get rid of or that I thought was

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:24.560 
would get rid of or that I thought was
the<00:03:22.110> weakest<00:03:22.440> is<00:03:22.590> the<00:03:22.769> wheel<00:03:22.980> set<00:03:23.280> by<00:03:23.489> far

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:24.570 
the weakest is the wheel set by far

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:28.340 
the weakest is the wheel set by far
they're<00:03:24.900> very<00:03:25.170> flexi<00:03:25.769> on<00:03:26.640> you<00:03:27.600> know<00:03:27.690> initial

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
they're very flexi on you know initial

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:30.620 
they're very flexi on you know initial
one<00:03:28.950> of<00:03:29.040> my<00:03:29.190> initial<00:03:29.610> test<00:03:29.880> rides<00:03:30.090> with<00:03:30.420> this

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630 
one of my initial test rides with this

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:32.479 
one of my initial test rides with this
particular<00:03:30.989> bike<00:03:31.440> I<00:03:31.590> ended<00:03:31.830> up<00:03:31.920> actually

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:32.489 
particular bike I ended up actually

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:34.310 
particular bike I ended up actually
breaking<00:03:32.790> the<00:03:32.970> front<00:03:33.180> wheel<00:03:33.480> unfortunately

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:34.320 
breaking the front wheel unfortunately

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:36.860 
breaking the front wheel unfortunately
we<00:03:35.040> did<00:03:35.220> get<00:03:35.400> a<00:03:35.430> replacement<00:03:35.850> for<00:03:36.209> it<00:03:36.360> still

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
we did get a replacement for it still

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:38.240 
we did get a replacement for it still
got<00:03:37.080> a<00:03:37.110> lot<00:03:37.290> of<00:03:37.350> time<00:03:37.590> on<00:03:37.799> it<00:03:37.920> but<00:03:37.950> there's

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
got a lot of time on it but there's

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:39.740 
got a lot of time on it but there's
still<00:03:38.430> a<00:03:38.489> lot<00:03:38.670> of<00:03:38.790> flex<00:03:39.060> in<00:03:39.180> there<00:03:39.360> and<00:03:39.510> there's

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
still a lot of flex in there and there's

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:42.530 
still a lot of flex in there and there's
a<00:03:39.810> lot<00:03:40.260> of<00:03:40.290> rotational<00:03:41.160> force<00:03:41.549> or<00:03:41.790> force

a lot of rotational force or force

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.330 
a lot of rotational force or force
required<00:03:43.049> to<00:03:43.170> get<00:03:43.410> the<00:03:43.560> wheel<00:03:43.739> to<00:03:43.980> spin<00:03:44.100> up

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
required to get the wheel to spin up

required to get the wheel to spin up
where<00:03:44.579> I<00:03:44.610> think<00:03:44.940> it<00:03:45.030> would<00:03:45.180> benefit<00:03:45.600> best<00:03:45.930> is<00:03:46.230> a

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:46.350 
where I think it would benefit best is a

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:49.490 
where I think it would benefit best is a
much<00:03:46.739> lighter<00:03:47.480> higher<00:03:48.480> performance<00:03:49.200> wheel

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
much lighter higher performance wheel

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.199 
much lighter higher performance wheel
set<00:03:49.769> and<00:03:49.860> I'm<00:03:49.920> not<00:03:50.070> talking<00:03:50.459> so<00:03:50.610> much<00:03:50.760> the<00:03:50.970> tire

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:51.209 
set and I'm not talking so much the tire

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:54.440 
set and I'm not talking so much the tire
itself<00:03:51.630> with<00:03:51.870> the<00:03:51.989> actual<00:03:52.320> rims<00:03:53.000> okay<00:03:54.000> and<00:03:54.239> if

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
itself with the actual rims okay and if

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:56.600 
itself with the actual rims okay and if
the<00:03:54.810> part<00:03:55.049> you<00:03:55.170> felt<00:03:55.410> was<00:03:55.560> the<00:03:55.739> best<00:03:55.769> like<00:03:56.310> for
