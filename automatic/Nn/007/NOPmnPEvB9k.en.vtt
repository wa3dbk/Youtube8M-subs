00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:12.450
 hello to all we meet today 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.160
 for a new unpacking video and 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.020
 of presentation today I you 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.090
 present and a little product that a type 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.740
 of product I have never shown you 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:23.160
 on the channel since it is a 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.420
 laptop support so here you 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.090
 can see it's the cooler model 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.769
 master ergo storm 2 you will allow to 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.269
 support laptops up to 17 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.470
 inch 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.989
 in fact it is a support for pc 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.700
 laptops that besides supporting 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.660
 injured will be able to make them say what 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.360
 you want to see that there is a small 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.940
 120mm fan behind this 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.110
 grid mesh therefore up to 17 inches 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.780
 with an ergonomic design 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.250
 according to the party in wick before can 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:51.320
 Moreover, to withdraw 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:54.030
 clean among others we can see here 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:57.539
 the placement of the laptop pc on this 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:01:00.180
 support hop we will look a little bit 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:02.219
 what in the back so you can see 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.600
 that here is how is the 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.250
 grid going forward you have five 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.930
 settings levels to have 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.210
 different angles at the back you have 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.939
 a usb hub with the setting of the 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.860
 fan rotation and you can 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:16.229
 besides turn off this fan and 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.909
 on the underside we can see as soon as there 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.170
 has one a year help on the one hand help 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:22.200
 actually that will help illuminate by 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:26.610
 example your keyboard if you place a 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:28.340
 keyboard in the front I bring you a closer 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.720
 little technical specifications 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:33.079
 for you to notice the 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.970
 dimensions what are marked right there 

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:39.869
 we will see the fan is a 140 mm 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:41.939
 sorry for the weight is 1.28 kg 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:44.210
 so if you want to transport it there 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:47.460
 keep it in mind 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:49.740
 it's not super light but that's 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.390
 precisely because there is fan 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.810
 included but it is a support in fact 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:56.270
 that he will rather remain attached to the pump if 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:00.649
 you put it at your desk 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:05.420
 or something like that I stop the 

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:06.469
 side box then in the wrong way 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:09.110
 we will see a little bit what is 

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:10.720
 provided so step and pose a big thing 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:13.700
 you just have the user guide 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.720
 very basic and a USB cable that goes 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.480
 allow to connect to your computer 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:20.420
 portal and via this case you're fine 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:24.500
 power the fan and the LEDs and 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:25.790
 allow to have drunk sv and is 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.940
 that there are four usb sockets on the back 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.650
 it will not connect devices 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:33.069
 who consume a lot because so much 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:36.349
 is that everything goes through a usb plug 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:37.130
 with usb is limited will not be no 

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:40.180
 more exaggerate 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:44.120
 there we will remove the protective films 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:46.190
 that's what this support already looks like 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:49.489
 when it's closed we can see who is 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:51.739
 closes completely so convenient for the 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:54.650
 transport anyway I'm going to 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:55.510
 eclipsed since it snaps when it 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:58.150
 is closed 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:00.859
 here and I will put the first 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:04.209
 position so that's the angle most 

00:03:00.859 --> 00:03:06.980
 important what can this support do 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:09.889
 I removed that you can see these 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:12.709
 small pieces that will unfold for 

00:03:09.889 --> 00:03:14.359
 allow to maintain the laptop and 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:15.799
 I 'm going to show how is the 

00:03:14.359 --> 00:03:17.260
 Mesh mesh in the front places it 

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:20.510
 very simply 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:25.069
 it looks simply went up in 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:27.680
 done and it snaps so it allows by 

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:30.380
 example of clean we see here the 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:31.459
 140 mm fan and as said 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:34.220
 previously you can dyes 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:37.060
 entirely if you so wish so 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:37.060
 you do not need it for example 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:42.870
 I'm just going to put his young life back 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:43.290
 in the sense must first fixed and in 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:48.270
 bone 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:48.750
 here I am going to show you what it is 

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:50.940
 can give 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:53.900
 I will take a laptop just 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:56.580
 and show you what it can give 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:58.700
 when we are going to put a computer on it 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:02.280
 so here I have a fairly important angle 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:04.800
 so here is my laptop from this land 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:06.390
 my laptop does not even do 

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:09.660
 not even enough so I'm going down a 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:11.760
 Here is how little stands 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:14.910
 here that at 15 inches you can see 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:16.859
 that if you put I turn you that 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:18.959
 if you put a 17 inch it's going a 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:27.530
 little bit exceeded on the side 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:27.530
 but the support will hold the shot that's it 

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:34.470
 so here we are at the weakest angle 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:37.290
 what can this support do I will put 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:41.190
 that aside then at the level of the work to 

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:44.850
 the back hop on you can see our 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:46.770
 four usb ports that we have here you have 

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:48.620
 so the ignition button and 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:51.150
 extinguishing LEDs 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:53.330
 we have the setting via a small wheel 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:59.490
 speed of rotation 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:05:03.419
 here we will see the usb entry that goes 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:07.169
 allow to feed all that hop I 

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:08.810
 will close a few moments I think 

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:11.010
 we have seen almost everything from this support 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:13.200
 I 'll just put a little video where I 

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:14.669
 so let's show you here the bar of 

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:17.460
 help what can it look like when 

00:05:14.669 --> 00:05:19.020
 she is on and then there is the back 

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:22.360
 you can see the feet 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:25.900
 slip-resistant which will avoid precisely 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:29.860
 no lining their leu support do not leave 

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:33.729
 when you put your computer on it 

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:37.210
 so I think we all saw this 

00:05:33.729 --> 00:05:39.069
 laptop support cooler master 

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:40.750
 and road in two I thank you for having 

00:05:39.069 --> 00:05:42.280
 watched this video and I tell you to the 

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:44.400
 next and do not hesitate to 

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:44.400
