00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.570
 we hired an actress who will 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.490
 walking in a crowded street 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:08.519
 I wonder how many men will turn on her 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.919
 attention you started on it will be white 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:13.999
 dress look how much attention 

00:00:10.919 --> 00:00:13.999
 men she will attract 

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:25.230
 it's been ten minutes she's nobody 

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:25.230
 she never looked just part of the crowd 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:34.480
 20 minutes and here is the first result in 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:36.700
 half an hour you can safely conclude that 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:38.739
 all attention was a few 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:39.190
 gazes that's not what we 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:41.320
 wanted to 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:43.420
 now the actress changes clothes in the second 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.930
 the dress is the only difference from 1 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:46.510
 Colour 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:48.640
 now the dress is red will it attract 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:51.040
 more male attention as it shows 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:53.710
 practice first turn of the head 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:57.240
 immediately followed and more 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:01:00.480
 one and more 

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:02.730
 just look at this guy alone 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.860
 single glance and he almost turned 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.620
 yourself neck let's remember that this is the same 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.810
 girl on the same street in the same dress 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:12.060
 but perceives it as perfect 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.370
 another person for the same time 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.720
 she got at least 3 times more 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:18.540
 admiring glances 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.780
 you say that everything is logical because red 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:24.150
 brighter and more noticeable color and it's true 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:26.370
 red color attracts attention but the essence 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.800
 its effects on the brain are much deeper 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:30.510
 recent studies published in 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:32.040
 experimental social journal 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:34.170
 psychology revealed 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.430
 that according to men women are in red 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.130
 more open 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.990
 sexual contact and it is not 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.840
 sure about red underwear 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:46.800
 it could be a regular t-shirt if she 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:48.960
 the red effect will be similar but 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.979
 why does red color affect so much 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:54.000
 our perception 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:56.430
 the answer lies in 5 baboon daughters yes yes 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.340
 everything goes back to our ancestors 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:01.560
 monkeys skin females during the season 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.090
 pairing turns red and this signal 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.759
 stayed in our subconscious until 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.530
 of today and so we found out that 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:09.690
 man actively responds to red 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:12.210
 color but whether it will cause them also 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.570
 greater desire to help start the light 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:15.030
 the game 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:17.130
 our actress returned to the same street in 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:19.460
 white dress now she will try 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:21.900
 ask a random man for a dollar 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:24.060
 will men satisfy a money request 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.010
 women in white dress you hello 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.690
 hello sorry there will be no dollar 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30.830

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:45.890

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:46.310
 men seem to have no time for a woman 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:48.530
 in white 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:51.010
 they are not ready to give her even a minute 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:54.800
 sorry you have a whole dollar 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:57.980
 the test showed that out of 50 men only 8 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:59.630
 have shared the dollar now let's 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:03.610

 just think if the color is red 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:33.520
 possesses such power and exerts such 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:35.580
 impact on our perception on what else 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:38.590
