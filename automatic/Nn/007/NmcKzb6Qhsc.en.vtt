like<00:05:10.050> these<00:05:10.380> this<00:05:11.190> some<00:05:12.120> of<00:05:12.240> these<00:05:12.330> themes

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:12.630 
like these this some of these themes

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:18.640 
like these this some of these themes
because<00:05:13.310> up<00:05:14.310> here<00:05:16.340> they<00:05:17.340> got<00:05:17.580> it<00:05:17.790> whydid<00:05:18.450> out

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:18.650 
because up here they got it whydid out

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:21.050 
because up here they got it whydid out
and<00:05:19.650> the<00:05:19.800> only<00:05:19.950> way<00:05:20.160> that<00:05:20.190> you<00:05:20.580> could<00:05:20.730> see<00:05:20.940> it

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:21.060 
and the only way that you could see it

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:22.610 
and the only way that you could see it
is<00:05:21.240> if<00:05:21.419> you<00:05:21.540> go<00:05:21.690> and<00:05:21.720> you<00:05:21.930> click<00:05:22.260> on<00:05:22.380> something

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:22.620 
is if you go and you click on something

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:25.340 
is if you go and you click on something
and<00:05:23.070> scroll<00:05:23.730> over<00:05:23.940> so<00:05:24.360> I<00:05:24.389> don't<00:05:24.840> really<00:05:25.020> like

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:25.350 
and scroll over so I don't really like

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:27.800 
and scroll over so I don't really like
that<00:05:25.740> theme<00:05:26.010> I<00:05:26.310> mean<00:05:26.639> all<00:05:26.970> the<00:05:27.150> rest<00:05:27.330> is<00:05:27.510> nice

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:27.810 
that theme I mean all the rest is nice

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:31.310 
that theme I mean all the rest is nice
you<00:05:28.680> could<00:05:28.860> go<00:05:29.010> in<00:05:29.280> and<00:05:29.310> I<00:05:30.110> imagine<00:05:31.110> you<00:05:31.230> could

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:31.320 
you could go in and I imagine you could

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:34.070
