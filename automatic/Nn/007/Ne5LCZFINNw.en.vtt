tree down there and I'm on the other

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:51.900 
tree down there and I'm on the other
side<00:03:49.500> of<00:03:49.620> the<00:03:49.680> airport<00:03:49.739> so

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:51.910 
side of the airport so

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:53.370 
side of the airport so
I<00:03:52.000> don't<00:03:52.330> think<00:03:52.510> the<00:03:52.570> soccer<00:03:52.750> game<00:03:52.990> still<00:03:53.230> gone

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:53.380 
I don't think the soccer game still gone

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:54.420 
I don't think the soccer game still gone
we<00:03:53.470> were<00:03:53.590> going<00:03:53.740> to<00:03:53.800> be<00:03:53.890> in<00:03:53.980> there<00:03:54.130> and<00:03:54.310> then

we were going to be in there and then

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:56.400 
we were going to be in there and then
the<00:03:54.550> soccer<00:03:54.760> game<00:03:55.000> was<00:03:55.180> their<00:03:55.330> house<00:03:55.480> against

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:56.410 
the soccer game was their house against

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:00.580 
the soccer game was their house against
it<00:03:56.530> so<00:03:57.690> that<00:03:58.690> feels<00:03:58.930> nice

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:00.590 
it so that feels nice

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:03.250

notice how the steering the amount of

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:10.690 
notice how the steering the amount of
effort<00:04:09.470> it<00:04:09.769> takes<00:04:09.890> it's<00:04:10.129> totally<00:04:10.430> different

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:10.700 
effort it takes it's totally different

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:12.130 
effort it takes it's totally different
at<00:04:10.760> low<00:04:10.879> speed<00:04:11.090> than<00:04:11.209> it<00:04:11.300> is<00:04:11.360> on<00:04:11.450> faster<00:04:11.810> spada

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:12.140 
at low speed than it is on faster spada

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:13.570 
at low speed than it is on faster spada

for<00:04:16.070> slow<00:04:16.310> application<00:04:16.880> like<00:04:17.030> parking<00:04:17.359> that's

00:04:17.439 --> 00:04:17.449 
for slow application like parking that's

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:19.449 
for slow application like parking that's
really<00:04:18.049> light<00:04:18.229> right<00:04:18.470> here<00:04:18.500> but<00:04:18.889> yet<00:04:19.100> at

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:19.459 
really light right here but yet at

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:20.890 
really light right here but yet at
higher<00:04:19.639> speeds<00:04:20.030> it<00:04:20.180> shuts<00:04:20.359> it<00:04:20.479> down<00:04:20.510> you<00:04:20.750> don't

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:20.900 
higher speeds it shuts it down you don't

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:22.300 
higher speeds it shuts it down you don't
have<00:04:21.019> that<00:04:21.109> pulley<00:04:21.410> dragging<00:04:21.949> around<00:04:22.040> when

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:22.310 
have that pulley dragging around when

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:25.330 
have that pulley dragging around when
you<00:04:22.370> don't<00:04:22.550> need<00:04:22.729> it<00:04:22.790> nope<00:04:23.680> go<00:04:24.680> around<00:04:24.800> yeah

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:25.340 
you don't need it nope go around yeah

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:32.040 
you don't need it nope go around yeah
and<00:04:25.580> then<00:04:25.699> will<00:04:25.820> this<00:04:25.910> back<00:04:26.150> again
