00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.850 

the<00:00:00.570> next<00:00:00.810> trick<00:00:00.960> I'm<00:00:01.110> going<00:00:01.260> to<00:00:01.319> show<00:00:01.469> you<00:00:01.530> is

00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:01.860 
the next trick I'm going to show you is

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:05.180 
the next trick I'm going to show you is
called<00:00:02.070> side<00:00:02.820> swap<00:00:03.120> 531<00:00:03.929> but<00:00:04.620> I've<00:00:04.740> also<00:00:04.890> heard

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:05.190 
called side swap 531 but I've also heard

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:07.220 
called side swap 531 but I've also heard
it<00:00:05.310> referred<00:00:05.430> to<00:00:05.640> as<00:00:06.000> high<00:00:06.299> middle<00:00:06.509> low<00:00:06.600> or<00:00:06.960> a

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:07.230 
it referred to as high middle low or a

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.589 
it referred to as high middle low or a
pattern<00:00:07.560> stack<00:00:07.950> now<00:00:08.849> the<00:00:08.910> reason<00:00:09.420> it's<00:00:09.540> called

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
pattern stack now the reason it's called

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:11.299 
pattern stack now the reason it's called
the<00:00:09.780> pattern<00:00:10.139> sack<00:00:10.380> is<00:00:10.590> because<00:00:10.889> the<00:00:11.099> way<00:00:11.250> you

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
the pattern sack is because the way you

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:13.190 
the pattern sack is because the way you
throw<00:00:11.639> the<00:00:11.790> balls<00:00:12.030> will<00:00:12.389> literally<00:00:12.660> stack

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
throw the balls will literally stack

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.379 
throw the balls will literally stack
them<00:00:13.469> in<00:00:13.679> a<00:00:13.920> way<00:00:14.070> that<00:00:14.309> they<00:00:14.460> fall<00:00:14.730> in<00:00:14.910> sequence

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
them in a way that they fall in sequence

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.220 
them in a way that they fall in sequence
kind<00:00:16.080> of<00:00:16.170> like<00:00:16.320> that<00:00:16.980> now<00:00:17.970> it's<00:00:18.359> not<00:00:18.449> as<00:00:18.840> the

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
kind of like that now it's not as the

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.230 
kind of like that now it's not as the
parent<00:00:19.619> with<00:00:19.800> three<00:00:20.039> balls<00:00:20.189> but<00:00:20.640> you<00:00:20.850> can<00:00:21.119> do

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
parent with three balls but you can do

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.090 
parent with three balls but you can do
this<00:00:21.420> trick<00:00:21.539> with<00:00:21.779> four<00:00:21.990> or<00:00:22.109> five<00:00:22.170> and<00:00:22.619> higher

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
this trick with four or five and higher

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.130 
this trick with four or five and higher
numbers<00:00:23.519> so<00:00:24.150> that<00:00:24.180> when<00:00:24.660> you're<00:00:24.840> doing<00:00:25.050> the

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
numbers so that when you're doing the

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.450 
numbers so that when you're doing the
trick<00:00:25.350> it<00:00:25.500> actually<00:00:25.859> looks<00:00:26.039> like<00:00:26.130> all<00:00:26.369> the

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
trick it actually looks like all the

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.839 
trick it actually looks like all the
balls<00:00:26.580> go<00:00:26.820> up<00:00:26.939> and<00:00:27.090> fall<00:00:27.840> together<00:00:28.460> now<00:00:29.460> in

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
balls go up and fall together now in

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.110 
balls go up and fall together now in
this<00:00:30.810> kick<00:00:31.529> you're<00:00:31.830> working<00:00:32.219> with<00:00:32.399> timing<00:00:32.850> in

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
this kick you're working with timing in

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.299 
this kick you're working with timing in
a<00:00:33.180> way<00:00:33.360> that<00:00:33.690> you<00:00:33.809> probably<00:00:34.170> have<00:00:34.800> not<00:00:34.980> done

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
a way that you probably have not done

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.330 
a way that you probably have not done
before<00:00:35.340> it's<00:00:36.329> very<00:00:36.690> important<00:00:37.290> to<00:00:37.649> learn<00:00:37.950> how

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
before it's very important to learn how

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.160 
before it's very important to learn how
high<00:00:39.059> a<00:00:39.420> throw<00:00:39.780> goes<00:00:40.110> to<00:00:40.920> fall<00:00:41.190> down<00:00:41.420> okay<00:00:42.450> the

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
high a throw goes to fall down okay the

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.080 
high a throw goes to fall down okay the
two<00:00:43.379> most<00:00:43.559> important<00:00:44.100> tricks<00:00:44.399> to<00:00:44.610> learn<00:00:44.760> for

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
two most important tricks to learn for

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.910 
two most important tricks to learn for
the<00:00:45.360> two<00:00:45.629> most<00:00:45.780> important<00:00:46.320> throws<00:00:46.559> to<00:00:46.770> learn

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
the two most important throws to learn

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.310 
the two most important throws to learn
for<00:00:47.129> this<00:00:47.219> trick<00:00:47.460> are<00:00:47.640> one<00:00:48.000> the<00:00:48.420> vamp<00:00:48.660> which

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
for this trick are one the vamp which

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.720 
for this trick are one the vamp which
you<00:00:49.440> would<00:00:49.559> use<00:00:49.710> for<00:00:49.739> a<00:00:49.950> four<00:00:50.190> for<00:00:50.370> one<00:00:50.579> or

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
you would use for a four for one or

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.880 
you would use for a four for one or
shower<00:00:50.940> pattern<00:00:51.210> and<00:00:51.510> two<00:00:52.050> your<00:00:52.410> high<00:00:52.590> throw

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
shower pattern and two your high throw

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.850 
shower pattern and two your high throw
you<00:00:53.579> need<00:00:53.850> to<00:00:54.030> be<00:00:54.149> able<00:00:54.360> to<00:00:54.750> throw<00:00:55.469> a<00:00:55.500> high

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
you need to be able to throw a high

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.110 
you need to be able to throw a high
3-ball<00:00:56.489> cascade<00:00:56.520> if<00:00:57.440> this<00:00:58.440> type<00:00:58.829> of<00:00:58.910> thing<00:00:59.910> is

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
3-ball cascade if this type of thing is

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.880 
3-ball cascade if this type of thing is
hard<00:01:00.359> for<00:01:00.570> you<00:01:00.690> you<00:01:00.989> need<00:01:01.170> to<00:01:01.230> practice<00:01:01.739> it

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
hard for you you need to practice it

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.000 
hard for you you need to practice it
till<00:01:02.129> it's<00:01:02.309> down<00:01:02.520> otherwise<00:01:03.030> this<00:01:03.750> trick<00:01:04.049> may

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
till it's down otherwise this trick may

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.440 
till it's down otherwise this trick may
be<00:01:05.070> far<00:01:05.549> more<00:01:05.580> difficult<00:01:05.850> than<00:01:06.210> it's

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
be far more difficult than it's

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.649 
be far more difficult than it's
necessary<00:01:07.670> now<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:08.760> essence<00:01:09.180> of<00:01:09.299> the<00:01:09.420> trick

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
necessary now the essence of the trick

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.560 
necessary now the essence of the trick
is<00:01:10.290> to<00:01:10.350> throw<00:01:10.680> a<00:01:10.710> high<00:01:10.950> throw<00:01:11.430> a<00:01:11.700> middle<00:01:12.330> throw

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
is to throw a high throw a middle throw

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.960 
is to throw a high throw a middle throw
and<00:01:12.840> then<00:01:13.290> a<00:01:13.320> vamp<00:01:16.159> it<00:01:17.159> doesn't<00:01:17.640> look<00:01:17.939> very

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
and then a vamp it doesn't look very

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.649 
and then a vamp it doesn't look very
difficult<00:01:18.840> maybe<00:01:19.170> but<00:01:20.479> because<00:01:21.479> you're

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
difficult maybe but because you're

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.390 
difficult maybe but because you're
dealing<00:01:21.810> with<00:01:22.049> timing<00:01:22.500> in<00:01:22.740> a<00:01:22.830> way<00:01:22.979> that<00:01:23.280> you

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
dealing with timing in a way that you

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.840 
dealing with timing in a way that you
probably<00:01:23.670> have<00:01:24.030> not<00:01:24.210> before<00:01:25.490> it's<00:01:26.490> going<00:01:26.759> to

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
probably have not before it's going to

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.850 
probably have not before it's going to
take<00:01:27.060> a<00:01:27.090> little<00:01:27.299> while<00:01:27.540> for<00:01:27.600> your<00:01:28.200> hands<00:01:28.710> and

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
take a little while for your hands and

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.760 
take a little while for your hands and
brain<00:01:29.400> to<00:01:29.729> get<00:01:29.850> a<00:01:29.880> hold<00:01:30.180> on<00:01:30.329> it<00:01:30.390> also<00:01:31.290> you're

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
brain to get a hold on it also you're

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.100 
brain to get a hold on it also you're
throwing<00:01:32.009> a<00:01:32.250> different<00:01:32.670> throw<00:01:33.030> every<00:01:33.540> time<00:01:33.810> at

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
throwing a different throw every time at

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.590 
throwing a different throw every time at
no<00:01:34.770> time<00:01:35.040> are<00:01:35.100> your<00:01:35.460> hands<00:01:35.790> doing<00:01:36.090> the<00:01:36.360> same

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
no time are your hands doing the same

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.460 
no time are your hands doing the same
thing<00:01:37.020> which<00:01:37.740> makes<00:01:38.700> kind<00:01:39.360> of<00:01:39.450> evaluating<00:01:40.259> and

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
thing which makes kind of evaluating and

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.380 
thing which makes kind of evaluating and
thinking<00:01:41.400> about<00:01:41.490> the<00:01:41.700> pattern<00:01:42.060> while<00:01:42.270> you're

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
thinking about the pattern while you're

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.710 
thinking about the pattern while you're
doing<00:01:42.659> it<00:01:42.720> very<00:01:42.990> difficult<00:01:43.399> it's<00:01:44.399> often<00:01:45.390> helps

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
doing it very difficult it's often helps

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.030 
doing it very difficult it's often helps
some<00:01:46.020> people<00:01:46.310> to<00:01:47.310> yell<00:01:47.579> hi<00:01:48.030> bitte<00:01:48.299> low<00:01:48.770> but<00:01:49.770> I

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
some people to yell hi bitte low but I

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.660 
some people to yell hi bitte low but I
personally<00:01:50.670> don't<00:01:50.820> suggest<00:01:51.149> it<00:01:52.430> one<00:01:53.430> thing

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
personally don't suggest it one thing

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.460 
personally don't suggest it one thing
that<00:01:53.850> is<00:01:54.000> very<00:01:54.060> common<00:01:54.479> the<00:01:54.840> second<00:01:55.200> you<00:01:55.259> start

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
that is very common the second you start

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.109 
that is very common the second you start
doing<00:01:55.680> patterns<00:01:56.219> with<00:01:56.369> high<00:01:56.520> throws<00:01:56.880> is

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
doing patterns with high throws is
