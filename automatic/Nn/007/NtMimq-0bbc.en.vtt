Cena<00:02:21.530> seems<00:02:21.980> to<00:02:22.130> go<00:02:22.250> through<00:02:22.489> periods<00:02:22.760> where

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
Cena seems to go through periods where

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:27.280 
Cena seems to go through periods where
he'll<00:02:24.260> change<00:02:24.590> out<00:02:24.860> his<00:02:25.190> color<00:02:25.550> scheme<00:02:26.290> so

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
he'll change out his color scheme so

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:28.360 
he'll change out his color scheme so

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
like I said as mentioning that in the

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:39.880 
like I said as mentioning that in the
earlier<00:02:37.370> part<00:02:37.730> of<00:02:37.790> the<00:02:37.879> review<00:02:38.500> John<00:02:39.500> Cena<00:02:39.739> is

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 
earlier part of the review John Cena is

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:40.240 
earlier part of the review John Cena is
quite

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
quite

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:43.270 
quite
brandable<00:02:41.290> they<00:02:42.290> can<00:02:42.470> market<00:02:42.860> everything

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
brandable they can market everything

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.510 
brandable they can market everything
with<00:02:43.580> John<00:02:43.760> Cena<00:02:44.000> I<00:02:45.160> don't<00:02:46.160> know<00:02:46.220> maybe<00:02:46.370> that's

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:46.520 
with John Cena I don't know maybe that's

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.370 
with John Cena I don't know maybe that's
why<00:02:46.730> some<00:02:46.940> adults<00:02:47.150> don't<00:02:47.660> seem<00:02:47.870> to<00:02:47.990> like<00:02:48.110> John

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
why some adults don't seem to like John

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:50.830 
why some adults don't seem to like John
Cena<00:02:48.590> as<00:02:48.740> much<00:02:48.920> is<00:02:49.070> that<00:02:49.250> he's<00:02:49.520> just<00:02:49.700> I<00:02:49.940> when<00:02:50.720> he

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840 
Cena as much is that he's just I when he

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.380

see<00:02:53.600> it<00:02:53.690> he's<00:02:53.900> been<00:02:54.080> somewhat<00:02:54.560> of<00:02:54.620> a<00:02:54.740> spoon-fed

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
see it he's been somewhat of a spoon-fed

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.480 
see it he's been somewhat of a spoon-fed
champion<00:02:55.970> he<00:02:56.470> WWE<00:02:57.470> kind<00:02:57.650> of<00:02:57.709> just<00:02:57.890> forces<00:02:58.340> it

down some of the fans throats they never

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:04.780 
down some of the fans throats they never
seem<00:03:03.380> to<00:03:03.410> do<00:03:03.590> that<00:03:03.620> I<00:03:03.770> think<00:03:03.890> with<00:03:04.130> rock<00:03:04.430> with

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 
seem to do that I think with rock with

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:06.910 
seem to do that I think with rock with
rock<00:03:05.090> and<00:03:05.420> Austin<00:03:05.660> they<00:03:06.080> just<00:03:06.260> kind<00:03:06.440> of<00:03:06.500> let<00:03:06.890> it

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:06.920 
rock and Austin they just kind of let it

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.970 
rock and Austin they just kind of let it
run<00:03:07.250> its<00:03:07.550> course<00:03:07.610> but<00:03:08.060> with<00:03:08.209> Cena<00:03:08.540> they<00:03:09.410> really

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 
run its course but with Cena they really

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:11.890 
run its course but with Cena they really
try<00:03:10.190> to<00:03:10.220> push<00:03:10.580> drive<00:03:11.120> home<00:03:11.390> the<00:03:11.570> fact<00:03:11.780> that

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
try to push drive home the fact that

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:13.540

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:27.380 
there of course I've got a mind is

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:29.620 
there of course I've got a mind is
displaced<00:03:27.830> in<00:03:28.070> that<00:03:28.190> you<00:03:28.250> can<00:03:28.400> take<00:03:28.580> off<00:03:28.790> and

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:29.630 
displaced in that you can take off and

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:31.030 
displaced in that you can take off and
much<00:03:29.870> like<00:03:30.050> all<00:03:30.200> the<00:03:30.290> other<00:03:30.410> figures<00:03:30.770> you<00:03:30.920> can

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.040 
much like all the other figures you can

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:34.390 
much like all the other figures you can
take<00:03:31.250> the<00:03:31.510> Elimination<00:03:32.510> Chamber<00:03:33.100> card<00:03:34.100> off

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:34.400 
take the Elimination Chamber card off

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:35.979 
take the Elimination Chamber card off
it's<00:03:34.610> just<00:03:34.730> a<00:03:34.790> piece<00:03:34.940> of<00:03:35.090> cardboard<00:03:35.360> slips

00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:35.989 
it's just a piece of cardboard slips

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:38.050 
it's just a piece of cardboard slips
into<00:03:36.230> the<00:03:36.620> display<00:03:37.160> stand<00:03:37.459> and<00:03:37.760> you<00:03:37.850> can<00:03:37.970> have

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:38.060 
into the display stand and you can have

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:39.850 
into the display stand and you can have
the<00:03:38.180> display<00:03:38.510> stand<00:03:38.780> just<00:03:39.050> on<00:03:39.200> its<00:03:39.410> own<00:03:39.560> if<00:03:39.770> you

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:39.860 
the display stand just on its own if you

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:43.750 
the display stand just on its own if you
live<00:03:40.070> if<00:03:40.340> you<00:03:40.489> like<00:03:42.010> I'm<00:03:43.010> almost<00:03:43.190> the<00:03:43.430> type<00:03:43.610> if

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:43.760 
live if you like I'm almost the type if

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:45.699 
live if you like I'm almost the type if
I<00:03:43.880> eat<00:03:44.030> as<00:03:44.750> much<00:03:44.959> as<00:03:45.140> I<00:03:45.230> don't<00:03:45.290> necessarily

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:45.709 
I eat as much as I don't necessarily

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:47.680 
I eat as much as I don't necessarily
like<00:03:46.250> it<00:03:46.310> says<00:03:46.580> Elimination<00:03:47.150> Chamber<00:03:47.360> if<00:03:47.570> I

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:47.690 
like it says Elimination Chamber if I

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:49.240 
like it says Elimination Chamber if I
was<00:03:47.900> to<00:03:48.049> take<00:03:48.200> it<00:03:48.260> off<00:03:48.500> this<00:03:48.769> probably<00:03:49.130> would

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:49.250 
was to take it off this probably would

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:50.920 
was to take it off this probably would
get<00:03:49.400> bent<00:03:49.670> so<00:03:50.090> I<00:03:50.120> think<00:03:50.480> I'm<00:03:50.570> probably<00:03:50.750> just

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:50.930 
get bent so I think I'm probably just

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:54.720 
get bent so I think I'm probably just
likely<00:03:51.440> to<00:03:51.620> keep<00:03:51.830> it<00:03:51.980> in<00:03:52.250> the<00:03:52.430> stand<00:03:52.940> itself

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:54.730 
likely to keep it in the stand itself

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:58.090 
likely to keep it in the stand itself
like<00:03:55.730> so<00:03:56.170> let's<00:03:57.170> put<00:03:57.350> it<00:03:57.440> to<00:03:57.560> the<00:03:57.590> side<00:03:57.860> for<00:03:57.890> a

00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:58.100 
like so let's put it to the side for a

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:00.970 
like so let's put it to the side for a
second<00:03:58.600> John<00:03:59.600> Cena<00:03:59.870> seems<00:04:00.230> to<00:04:00.380> share<00:04:00.560> the<00:04:00.739> same

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:00.980 
second John Cena seems to share the same

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:04.630 
second John Cena seems to share the same
torso<00:04:01.549> as<00:04:01.989> Batista<00:04:02.989> I<00:04:03.340> don't<00:04:04.340> know<00:04:04.430> I<00:04:04.459> don't

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:04.640 
torso as Batista I don't know I don't

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:05.650 
torso as Batista I don't know I don't
think<00:04:04.940> his<00:04:05.030> arms

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:05.660 
think his arms

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:07.240 
think his arms
I<00:04:05.690> don't<00:04:06.110> believe<00:04:06.350> his<00:04:06.470> arms<00:04:06.799> to<00:04:06.950> be<00:04:07.040> I<00:04:07.070> don't

I don't believe his arms to be I don't
actually<00:04:07.459> have<00:04:07.610> Batista<00:04:08.390> with<00:04:08.540> me<00:04:08.720> here<00:04:08.959> but<00:04:09.170> I

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:09.380 
actually have Batista with me here but I

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:11.259 
actually have Batista with me here but I
don't<00:04:10.070> believe<00:04:10.130> his<00:04:10.370> arms<00:04:10.730> are<00:04:10.850> the<00:04:10.970> same<00:04:11.150> as

00:04:11.259 --> 00:04:11.269 
don't believe his arms are the same as

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:16.240 
don't believe his arms are the same as
Batista's<00:04:11.840> I<00:04:13.750> think<00:04:14.750> the<00:04:14.870> torso<00:04:15.500> works<00:04:15.950> better

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:16.250 
Batista's I think the torso works better

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:18.520 
Batista's I think the torso works better
I<00:04:16.370> think<00:04:16.669> on<00:04:16.820> Cena<00:04:17.269> than<00:04:17.750> it<00:04:17.870> does<00:04:17.989> on<00:04:18.019> Batista

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:18.530 
I think on Cena than it does on Batista

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:19.840 
I think on Cena than it does on Batista

what it is is it's a similar it used to
start<00:05:31.789> similar<00:05:32.090> to<00:05:32.449> a<00:05:33.280> Death<00:05:34.280> Valley<00:05:34.550> driver

less of a DAF Death Valley driver and

less of a DAF Death Valley driver and
more<00:05:45.050> of<00:05:45.229> kinda<00:05:45.860> he<00:05:45.979> puts<00:05:46.220> the<00:05:46.310> guys<00:05:46.460> on<00:05:46.639> his

that's by that point that's asking a lot
for<00:06:53.360> figures<00:06:54.280> but<00:06:55.280> the<00:06:55.400> John<00:06:55.610> Cena<00:06:55.849> I<00:06:55.970> like

00:06:56.790 --> 00:06:56.800
