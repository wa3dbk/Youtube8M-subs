00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.480 
good at something so I fucked up quite a
bit<00:02:16.170> so<00:02:17.170> hopefully<00:02:17.320> I'm<00:02:17.620> good<00:02:18.100> at<00:02:18.220> what<00:02:18.250> I'm

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:18.490 
bit so hopefully I'm good at what I'm

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:20.940 
bit so hopefully I'm good at what I'm
doing<00:02:18.550> right<00:02:18.910> now<00:02:18.970> I<00:02:19.300> do<00:02:20.290> think<00:02:20.560> I<00:02:20.680> could<00:02:20.860> have

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
doing right now I do think I could have

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:22.470 
doing right now I do think I could have
stood<00:02:21.100> my<00:02:21.250> ground<00:02:21.280> sometimes<00:02:21.820> a<00:02:22.120> lot<00:02:22.270> more

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
stood my ground sometimes a lot more

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.990 
stood my ground sometimes a lot more
than<00:02:22.780> because<00:02:23.410> I<00:02:23.500> am<00:02:23.680> more<00:02:23.950> now<00:02:24.190> and<00:02:24.460> it's

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
than because I am more now and it's

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.930 
than because I am more now and it's
working<00:02:25.300> great<00:02:25.540> and<00:02:25.840> I<00:02:26.010> think<00:02:27.010> again<00:02:27.520> clients

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
working great and I think again clients

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:29.310 
working great and I think again clients
want<00:02:28.150> really<00:02:28.420> strong<00:02:28.630> leadership<00:02:28.960> and

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:29.320 
want really strong leadership and

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:31.620 
want really strong leadership and
sometimes<00:02:29.680> maybe<00:02:29.890> I<00:02:30.010> was<00:02:30.160> too<00:02:30.340> nice<00:02:30.630> it

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630 
sometimes maybe I was too nice it

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:33.960 
sometimes maybe I was too nice it
shouldn't<00:02:31.930> be<00:02:31.990> so<00:02:32.140> fucking<00:02:32.500> nice<00:02:32.710> I<00:02:33.010> make

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
shouldn't be so fucking nice I make

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:35.970 
shouldn't be so fucking nice I make
mistakes<00:02:34.330> daily<00:02:34.690> I<00:02:34.840> don't<00:02:35.170> I<00:02:35.380> think<00:02:35.770> if<00:02:35.890> I

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
mistakes daily I don't I think if I

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.100 
mistakes daily I don't I think if I
don't<00:02:36.400> make<00:02:36.550> mistakes<00:02:36.640> and<00:02:37.150> I<00:02:37.180> wouldn't<00:02:38.020> know

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
don't make mistakes and I wouldn't know

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:39.390 
don't make mistakes and I wouldn't know
if<00:02:38.230> I'm<00:02:38.320> doing<00:02:38.350> anything<00:02:38.650> right<00:02:38.890> I<00:02:39.070> think<00:02:39.310> in

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
if I'm doing anything right I think in

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.670 
if I'm doing anything right I think in
the<00:02:39.520> beginning<00:02:39.670> or<00:02:40.180> maybe<00:02:40.840> in<00:02:40.990> the<00:02:41.110> middle<00:02:41.440> I

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
the beginning or maybe in the middle I

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.250 
the beginning or maybe in the middle I
slacked<00:02:42.610> off<00:02:42.790> a<00:02:42.850> little<00:02:43.090> and<00:02:43.330> offered<00:02:43.810> because

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
slacked off a little and offered because

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.580
