00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
this okay so I'm gonna take one longer I

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:40.170 
this okay so I'm gonna take one longer I
can<00:02:37.610> take<00:02:37.760> both<00:02:37.970> of<00:02:38.030> them<00:02:38.269> and<00:02:38.720> put<00:02:38.959> the<00:02:39.470> orange

on it every other space do this for both

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:51.400 
on it every other space do this for both
of<00:02:46.370> them<00:02:46.670> in<00:02:47.000> the<00:02:47.239> same<00:02:47.510> way<00:02:48.400> like<00:02:49.400> this<00:02:50.410> now

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:51.410 
of them in the same way like this now

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:55.360 
of them in the same way like this now
turn<00:02:52.099> one<00:02:52.280> this<00:02:52.819> way<00:02:53.829> now<00:02:54.829> pull<00:02:55.040> them<00:02:55.190> together

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
turn one this way now pull them together

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:57.250 
turn one this way now pull them together
and<00:02:55.760> you'll<00:02:56.569> see<00:02:56.690> it<00:02:56.780> makes<00:02:56.930> a<00:02:56.989> cool<00:02:57.140> little

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.260 
and you'll see it makes a cool little

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.740 
and you'll see it makes a cool little
pattern<00:02:57.680> leave<00:02:58.130> it<00:02:58.280> like<00:02:58.370> that<00:02:58.430> and<00:02:59.299> let's

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750 
pattern leave it like that and let's

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:02.680 
pattern leave it like that and let's
build<00:02:59.959> this<00:03:00.110> take<00:03:01.099> this<00:03:01.480> put<00:03:02.480> it<00:03:02.569> in<00:03:02.630> the

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:02.690 
build this take this put it in the

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:05.199 
build this take this put it in the
bottom<00:03:03.019> the<00:03:03.440> two<00:03:03.590> by<00:03:03.739> two<00:03:03.769> two<00:03:04.250> by<00:03:04.370> one<00:03:04.400> sorry

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:05.209 
bottom the two by two two by one sorry

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:08.890 
bottom the two by two two by one sorry
so<00:03:05.390> looks<00:03:05.540> like<00:03:05.599> that<00:03:06.400> turn<00:03:07.400> these<00:03:07.760> so<00:03:08.690> they're

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:08.900 
so looks like that turn these so they're

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:11.530 
so looks like that turn these so they're
like<00:03:09.019> that<00:03:09.200> you<00:03:10.040> simply<00:03:10.280> take<00:03:10.760> these<00:03:11.120> and<00:03:11.510> put

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:11.540 
like that you simply take these and put

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:14.590 
like that you simply take these and put
them<00:03:11.930> on<00:03:12.579> so<00:03:13.579> they're<00:03:13.850> in<00:03:13.970> the<00:03:14.120> configuration

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:14.600 
them on so they're in the configuration

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:21.190 
them on so they're in the configuration
that<00:03:14.870> is<00:03:15.049> show<00:03:15.230> you

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200
