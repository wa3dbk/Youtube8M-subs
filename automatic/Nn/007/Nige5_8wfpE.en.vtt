and it stutters every once in a while

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:04.869 
and it stutters every once in a while
but<00:04:01.840> this<00:04:02.840> is<00:04:03.109> kind<00:04:04.040> of<00:04:04.129> amazing<00:04:04.370> that<00:04:04.760> is

00:04:04.869 --> 00:04:04.879 
but this is kind of amazing that is

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:11.440 
but this is kind of amazing that is
running<00:04:05.299> as<00:04:05.450> well<00:04:06.200> as<00:04:06.680> it<00:04:06.769> is<00:04:08.530> and<00:04:10.239> this<00:04:11.239> whole

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:11.450 
running as well as it is and this whole

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:13.089 
running as well as it is and this whole
thing<00:04:11.599> was<00:04:11.750> shot<00:04:11.930> in<00:04:12.049> real<00:04:12.170> time<00:04:12.439> so<00:04:12.709> it<00:04:12.890> took<00:04:13.069> a

00:04:13.089 --> 00:04:13.099 
thing was shot in real time so it took a

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:16.960 
thing was shot in real time so it took a
while<00:04:13.310> to<00:04:13.370> load<00:04:13.840> but<00:04:14.840> once<00:04:15.230> it<00:04:15.439> did<00:04:15.769> I<00:04:16.160> mean<00:04:16.820> it

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:16.970 
while to load but once it did I mean it

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:19.479 
while to load but once it did I mean it
seems<00:04:17.600> pretty<00:04:17.870> decent<00:04:18.109> I<00:04:18.530> don't<00:04:19.190> think<00:04:19.370> this

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:19.489 
seems pretty decent I don't think this

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:20.499 
seems pretty decent I don't think this
would<00:04:19.669> be<00:04:19.699> something<00:04:20.150> you'd<00:04:20.269> want<00:04:20.449> to

00:04:20.499 --> 00:04:20.509 
would be something you'd want to

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:22.360 
would be something you'd want to
seriously<00:04:20.780> play<00:04:21.259> on<00:04:21.410> but<00:04:21.680> as<00:04:21.769> far<00:04:22.009> as<00:04:22.039> like

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:22.370 
seriously play on but as far as like

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:24.159 
seriously play on but as far as like
needing<00:04:22.759> to<00:04:23.090> check<00:04:23.449> your<00:04:23.630> auctions<00:04:24.050> or

00:04:24.159 --> 00:04:24.169 
needing to check your auctions or

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:28.980 
needing to check your auctions or
something<00:04:24.500> this<00:04:24.620> is<00:04:25.090> pretty<00:04:26.090> primo<00:04:26.539> actually

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:28.990 
something this is pretty primo actually

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:32.439 
something this is pretty primo actually
so<00:04:29.990> there<00:04:30.259> you<00:04:30.350> have<00:04:30.410> it<00:04:30.699> world<00:04:31.699> warcraft<00:04:32.210> on<00:04:32.419> a
