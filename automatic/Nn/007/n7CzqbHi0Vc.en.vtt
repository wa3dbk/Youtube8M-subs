00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:13.320
 present my equestrian center bends to 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:16.320
 cities so since my first video 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.850

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.990
 will help me a lot 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:24.869
 so that's so first of all nothing 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.730
 the cards of so the tables challenge 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.539
 of display where I'm not going all you 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.189
 to say because it's not very 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.660
 interesting but comes back to the center 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.460
 equestrian fire add so there you 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.880
 see roadshow actually it's a center 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.840
 equestrian 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:39.149
 so all there is all the things 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:43.350
 that we actually recommend here it's all 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:44.789
 what we do as activity then there 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.010
 that's all we missed edge that 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:49.710
 ride and so on it's all the 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.210
 bonnets that horses to the bodies of 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.719
 ponies and horses so that's so we 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:59.270
 has 25 commissions for other animals 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:01:04.140
 here is the material made available 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:06.810
 here it's all the characters there so what 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.890
 are the rates so here we are all from 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:12.119
 following the visit 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:17.030
 so that's what it looks like 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:19.920
 we are precarious from the top so 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:23.250
 So here we will immediately begin 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:27.840
 by the partner so here so we have some 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:29.180
 cars and trailers and desalle and a 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.829
 motorcycle I do not really know what she does a 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:35.009
 then here we go to the trailer 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:35.880
 so that's commitment I stay here 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:39.420
 not right now because I'm going 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:42.510
 present after with their box then we 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:46.140
 come in here so one side of 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:51.530
 a valve and we arrive at the infirmary 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:54.390
 here the home here and the club house here 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:56.580
 then we have tables because 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:02:00.750
 that there is a small bar actually if you want 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:07.140
 to eat or what then there is the big 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:10.640
 pre so the price of skeins so here 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:16.770
 still a horse he was going to cool 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:20.310
 then we have red with melanie 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:23.120
 who devote a horse so I tell you 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:28.320
 will also show a price on dogs 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:29.880
 here we have the carousel so like that so 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.980
 at this moment it's marine that makes 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.870
 aerobatics 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:35.450
 So here we have children who 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:39.720
 look 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:41.220
 here we have career so career 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:44.430
 so right now the ja's going on at 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.900
 gallop level 2 so who are they they 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.950
 are jumping with stÃ©phanie 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:51.590
 so the instructor a monitrice 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:55.350
 here we have the upholstery 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:57.209
 so it's me who did it so that's it 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:01.830
 so there's not all the saddles she's 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:09.290
 not really tidy but good then if 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:09.290
 if we have food reserves and 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:15.540
 here we have the plate when the plate where 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:18.330
 the farrier my can take care 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:21.630
 hooves of deposits is and 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:24.720
 horses so here we are here and here 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:27.230
 we have the shower 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:33.180
 so I'm going to put the horses back in 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:37.860
 their box to show you their box and 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:39.270
 which horse one of them in a concern here 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:42.750
 there is the shetland loan I had 

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:46.590
 forgot to show you before the boks 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:47.610
 because in fact he is so he is he 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:51.080
 is not quite and this independently 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:54.480
 right this equestrian center is here more 

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:55.440
 while here it is here is the loan 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:59.580
 centuries are so there is a 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:02.360
 here it is so right now 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:07.020
 the boks 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:09.090
 so we'll start here here so here and 

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:13.140
 there reserved for the mans and safe in front of us 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:15.959
 have the mares so with cop a 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:20.489
 so it's a black path little guy 

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:25.860
 a foal pearls gold so wait for a 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:26.970
 month warns is like this with his 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:28.290
 scarf 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:32.130
 chevrette so it's a customization 

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:33.660
 it does not exist so I made debate the 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:36.200
 lighten your plans and I had made it 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:39.950
 mane to black and that's clearly 

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:48.860
 then on the default stabulation is 

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:51.540
 so in it on snow cake cocoa 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:56.510
 pirates 

00:04:51.540 --> 00:05:02.490
 so here we will have to champion and 

00:04:56.510 --> 00:05:05.730
 so m here after that so here was where 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:08.040
 there was a farrier place and no 

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:12.230
 really horses but well here's the lie 

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:15.000
 at the goat are horses the iowa 

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:17.480
 here so we have good boy so it's a 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:21.660
 black horse with his owner 

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:25.500
 jules and on mac vanilla car with his 

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:29.430
 owner then marries then in this 

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:33.870
 box and if we have mustache 

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:43.160
 so it's a horse me my name as 

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:44.310
 if then we have an 11th then we have 

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:46.430
 asterix 

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:49.650
 so yes, this is a customization 

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:51.270
 do not look for having placed a 

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:55.350
 conversion in fact of my creation 

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:56.970
 so it's me who did it here and 

00:05:55.350 --> 00:06:02.250
 asterix and the three little tasks of 

00:05:56.970 --> 00:06:04.800
 their side listen here 

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:05.880
 normally if I can find yes there 

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:09.810
 three small tasks actually on a 

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:11.160
 couple and so that's so I'm doing 

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:11.820
 reviews needed to rethink clients and its 

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:16.020
 excess 

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:18.770
 and then if the duchess so frozen 

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:21.410
 redone in the base and chestnuts 

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:25.110
 it's the same as customization 

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:27.570
 here we have two busts so it's a 

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:28.830
 customization is so I do not know 

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:29.310
 it's not a dress that exists in the 

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:35.120
 reality 

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:38.120
 in any case I do not think here it was 

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:38.120
 Scrooge 

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:57.470
 here we have his ribs he here maya here at 

00:06:49.430 --> 00:07:00.700

00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:12.140
 surprise so today like this 

00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:13.100
 then we roamed lotis so that's the 

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:18.800
 horse that is being made 

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:20.300
 devour and if we left says so 

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:22.340
