 ah 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:36.910
 the stage piano mt 11 has been 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:38.530
 designed and manufactured to meet 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:41.530
 the highest demands of the

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:48.489
 all its important functions its 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:50.350
 extremely sensitive keyboard that to 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:52.510
 To tell the truth, it's not surprising coming from 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:55.000
 one of the piano makers more 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:58.290
 the world's renowned are the great 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.290
 traits of mp 11 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:03.980
 Now let's look more closely at the keyboard 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:06.800
 great field the 88 wooden keys 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:09.590
 feature the sumptuous ivory surface 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:12.229
 field that resembles ivory with total 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:14.479
 realism the distance between the bar 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:16.220
 side and the front face of the keys 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:19.040
 is the same as in a grand piano 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:21.350
 acoustic and graduated weighting 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.300
 offers the expressive brilliance that 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:25.580
 wait for an authentic grand piano 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:28.550
 concert while the three sensors 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:31.810
 in each key they faithfully capture all 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:31.810
 the nuances of interpretation 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:53.759
 ah 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:03.270
 now let's move on to the extensive complement of 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:06.510
 sounds the mp 11 offers three sections 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:08.970
 of sound the piano section includes 12 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:11.610
 piano sounds different between them 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:14.790

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:21.930
 variants in mono the piano section 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:24.330
 electric includes metals winds fm and 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:26.370

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:28.880
 electric tail particularly 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.880
 remarkable 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:52.770
 but the mp 11 also includes ropes 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:52.770

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:08.200
 dynamic interpretation while 

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:10.350
 that the excellent digital converters 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:13.750
 analogue offer a totally sound 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:15.910
 crystalline design philosophy behind 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:17.740
 of this very special instrument is the 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:20.140
 attention in each and every one of the 

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:23.530
 details this is more evident in the 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:26.010
 virtual technical function this allows that 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:29.080
 the mp 11 fits personal taste 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:31.360
 including parameters such as 

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:33.610
 softness of hammer mechanism 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:36.220
 hammer throw in particular 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:39.190
 in the electric pianos amplitude of the 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:42.570

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:12.440
 for electric pianos the mp 11 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:15.500
 offers 5 simulations of amplifiers 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:17.390
 to choose from the soft distortion of 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:19.360
 the classic valve amplifiers 

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:21.860
 until the placement of the microphone 

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:24.080
 A large suitcase is also included 

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:27.970
 effects with study quality such 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:31.580
 like river chorus flanger compressor

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:57.770
 effects settings can by 

00:04:55.730 --> 00:05:00.320
 supposedly controlled using the 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:03.280
 rotating an expression pedal or the 

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:03.280
 modulation wheel 

00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:11.840
 ah

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:26.160
 do not 

00:05:29.639 --> 00:05:34.740
 each of the three sound sections 

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:37.169
 can be played autonomously in layers 

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:39.629
 with the keyboard divided or assigned to 

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:41.969
 a zone of the keyboard the mp 11 also 

00:05:39.629 --> 00:05:43.710
 includes four configurable midi zones 

00:05:41.969 --> 00:05:45.930
 to control sound modules 

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:48.240
 external therefore this piano 

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:51.080
 stage is also ideal to make a 

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:51.080
 master keyboard 

00:05:53.409 --> 00:05:56.309

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:01.690
 to 

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:09.500
 the mp 11 offers everything one expects 

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:11.930
 on the piano leading on such a stage 

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:14.000
 as 208 memories for settings of 

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:16.430
 instruments that can also be 

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.740
 store in a usb device too 

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:20.950
 It is integrated reproduction and 

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:23.810
 recording of audio and midi files 

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:27.139
 including support for wav files and 

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:29.510
 mp3 and a very useful loop function the 

00:06:27.139 --> 00:06:31.669
 integrated metronome offers much more than 

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:34.160
 just keep time with 100 rhythms 

00:06:31.669 --> 00:06:36.710
 of a wide range of styles for 

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:38.480
 any situation is also included 

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:39.500
 a wide range of options for 

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:43.280
 connection to other equipment 

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:45.530
 xlr outputs with ground connection make 

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:47.540
 that the mp 11 is a very 

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:50.120
 appreciated by sound technicians in 

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:52.669
 Live also includes stereo outputs 

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:54.560
 an entry with volume control for 

00:06:52.669 --> 00:06:58.310
 connect an additional three keyboard 

00:06:54.560 --> 00:07:00.590
 midi ports a usb for the computer and 

00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:03.050
 the tickets for expression pedals and 

00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:05.750
 pedal controllers a three pedal 

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:08.000
 tracks is also included as standard the 

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:10.040
 mp 11 is the stage instrument 

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.600
 perfect for pianists 

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:15.110

 a very functioning concept 

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:22.040
 intuitive that does not require the previous 

00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:24.350
 study of the manual in summary this is a
