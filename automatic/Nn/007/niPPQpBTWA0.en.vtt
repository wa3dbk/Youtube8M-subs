work in labs on the USC campus the work

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.580 
work in labs on the USC campus the work
we're<00:00:50.039> doing<00:00:50.070> is<00:00:50.640> taking<00:00:51.329> a<00:00:51.629> blind<00:00:51.960> person<00:00:52.170> and

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
we're doing is taking a blind person and

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.520 
we're doing is taking a blind person and
putting<00:00:52.860> a<00:00:52.920> computer<00:00:53.370> chip<00:00:53.520> in<00:00:53.699> there<00:00:53.850> I<00:00:53.910> and

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:54.530 
putting a computer chip in there I and

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:57.319 
putting a computer chip in there I and
by<00:00:55.530> doing<00:00:55.800> so<00:00:55.949> this<00:00:56.399> computer<00:00:56.940> chip<00:00:57.149> allows

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
by doing so this computer chip allows

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.110 
by doing so this computer chip allows
them<00:00:57.809> to<00:00:57.960> wirelessly<00:00:58.649> connect<00:00:59.340> to<00:00:59.550> a<00:00:59.579> camera

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
them to wirelessly connect to a camera

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.569 
them to wirelessly connect to a camera
so<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:01.050> cameras<00:01:01.500> worn<00:01:01.769> in<00:01:01.949> the<00:01:01.980> glasses<00:01:02.550> and

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
so the cameras worn in the glasses and

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.359 
so the cameras worn in the glasses and
sends<00:01:03.090> the<00:01:03.210> information<00:01:03.329> to<00:01:03.809> the<00:01:04.050> brain

00:01:04.359 --> 00:01:04.369 
sends the information to the brain

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:06.469 
sends the information to the brain
allowing<00:01:05.369> the<00:01:05.519> blind<00:01:05.759> person<00:01:06.149> to<00:01:06.270> see

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
allowing the blind person to see

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.450 
allowing the blind person to see
basically<00:01:07.410> I'm<00:01:07.770> going<00:01:07.979> to<00:01:08.039> be<00:01:08.130> putting

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
basically I'm going to be putting

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.730 
basically I'm going to be putting
different<00:01:08.789> amounts<00:01:09.240> of<00:01:09.360> current<00:01:09.590> through<00:01:10.590> the

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
different amounts of current through the

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.030 
different amounts of current through the
resistor<00:01:11.220> and<00:01:11.630> measuring<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:13.049> corresponding

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
resistor and measuring the corresponding

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.609 
resistor and measuring the corresponding
temperature<00:01:14.250> for<00:01:14.850> that<00:01:15.060> current<00:01:15.619> education

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
temperature for that current education

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.160 
temperature for that current education
has<00:01:16.799> to<00:01:16.950> be<00:01:17.070> much<00:01:17.400> more<00:01:17.430> hands-on<00:01:18.000> we<00:01:18.840> can't

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
has to be much more hands-on we can't

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.859 
has to be much more hands-on we can't
continue<00:01:19.500> to<00:01:19.890> just<00:01:20.130> educate<00:01:20.689> students<00:01:21.689> in

range<00:02:18.300> for<00:02:18.630> the<00:02:18.720> University<00:02:19.319> I<00:02:19.470> talked<00:02:20.370> to<00:02:20.490> the

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
range for the University I talked to the

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.059 
range for the University I talked to the
principal<00:02:21.090> investigator<00:02:21.770> find<00:02:22.770> out<00:02:22.920> what

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:23.069 
principal investigator find out what

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:25.540 
principal investigator find out what
kind<00:02:23.280> of<00:02:23.370> research<00:02:23.670> is<00:02:23.910> being<00:02:24.090> done<00:02:24.209> there

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:25.550 
kind of research is being done there

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:28.280 
kind of research is being done there
then<00:02:26.550> I<00:02:26.580> explained<00:02:27.209> to<00:02:27.240> them<00:02:27.480> carefully<00:02:28.080> the

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
then I explained to them carefully the

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.170 
then I explained to them carefully the
time<00:02:28.590> commitment<00:02:29.040> that<00:02:29.340> the<00:02:29.459> students<00:02:29.940> need

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
time commitment that the students need

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.470 
time commitment that the students need
to<00:02:30.360> make<00:02:30.540> the<00:02:30.810> students<00:02:31.319> are<00:02:31.590> in<00:02:31.920> lab<00:02:32.480> two

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
to make the students are in lab two

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.530 
to make the students are in lab two
hours<00:02:33.900> a<00:02:33.930> day<00:02:34.370> minimally<00:02:35.370> and<00:02:35.640> the<00:02:36.120> students

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
hours a day minimally and the students

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.150 
hours a day minimally and the students
have<00:02:36.690> to<00:02:36.810> understand<00:02:37.319> that<00:02:37.620> they're<00:02:37.800> actually

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
have to understand that they're actually

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.460 
have to understand that they're actually
partaking<00:02:38.700> in<00:02:38.819> real<00:02:39.060> research<00:02:39.540> it's<00:02:39.959> not<00:02:40.290> a

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
partaking in real research it's not a

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.070 
partaking in real research it's not a
class<00:02:41.010> it's<00:02:41.280> not<00:02:41.340> on<00:02:41.610> the<00:02:41.700> bell<00:02:41.880> schedule<00:02:42.510> so

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
class it's not on the bell schedule so

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:44.420 
class it's not on the bell schedule so
that<00:02:43.110> if<00:02:43.440> they're<00:02:43.590> in<00:02:43.680> the<00:02:43.800> middle<00:02:44.010> of<00:02:44.250> a

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
that if they're in the middle of a

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.460 
that if they're in the middle of a
procedure<00:02:44.880> they<00:02:45.510> can't<00:02:45.810> just<00:02:46.050> get<00:02:46.200> up<00:02:46.230> and

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
procedure they can't just get up and

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.490 
procedure they can't just get up and
walk<00:02:46.709> out<00:02:47.569> what<00:02:48.569> our<00:02:48.810> students<00:02:49.350> are<00:02:49.470> doing

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
walk out what our students are doing

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.610 
walk out what our students are doing
today<00:02:49.920> is<00:02:50.040> testing<00:02:50.880> the<00:02:50.910> activity<00:02:51.540> of<00:02:51.620> several

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
today is testing the activity of several

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.930 
today is testing the activity of several
drugs<00:02:52.980> that<00:02:53.610> we<00:02:54.090> designed<00:02:55.130> against<00:02:56.130> hiv-1

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940

the crop they're the best of the best in
the<00:03:04.680> country<00:03:04.769> in<00:03:05.310> fact<00:03:05.630> when<00:03:06.630> I<00:03:06.660> was<00:03:06.989> a<00:03:07.019> high

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
the country in fact when I was a high

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:08.570 
the country in fact when I was a high
school<00:03:07.200> student<00:03:07.560> I<00:03:07.920> would<00:03:07.980> have<00:03:08.190> been<00:03:08.370> so

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:08.580 
school student I would have been so

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:11.509 
school student I would have been so
happy<00:03:08.819> just<00:03:09.390> go<00:03:09.690> in<00:03:09.840> a<00:03:09.930> lab<00:03:10.140> wash<00:03:10.470> the<00:03:10.620> dishes<00:03:10.830> I

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:11.519 
happy just go in a lab wash the dishes I

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:14.150 
happy just go in a lab wash the dishes I
mean<00:03:11.910> but<00:03:12.269> now<00:03:12.450> my<00:03:13.050> students<00:03:13.560> actually<00:03:13.769> doing

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
mean but now my students actually doing

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:15.920 
mean but now my students actually doing
experiments<00:03:14.880> and<00:03:15.060> these<00:03:15.330> experiments<00:03:15.840> are

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
experiments and these experiments are

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:18.259 
experiments and these experiments are
really<00:03:16.290> very<00:03:16.769> high<00:03:17.040> level<00:03:17.459> sophisticated

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:18.269 
really very high level sophisticated

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:19.910 
really very high level sophisticated
experiments<00:03:18.900> the<00:03:18.989> same<00:03:19.200> experiments<00:03:19.890> that

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
experiments the same experiments that

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.009 
experiments the same experiments that
the<00:03:20.220> postdocs<00:03:20.819> and<00:03:21.060> graduate<00:03:21.150> students<00:03:21.900> are

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:22.019 
the postdocs and graduate students are

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:23.690 
the postdocs and graduate students are
doing<00:03:22.049> so<00:03:22.590> the<00:03:22.709> high<00:03:22.829> school<00:03:23.100> students<00:03:23.610> are

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
doing so the high school students are

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.520 
doing so the high school students are
really<00:03:23.850> this<00:03:24.150> is<00:03:24.299> fantastic<00:03:24.870> for<00:03:24.900> them<00:03:25.079> they

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
really this is fantastic for them they

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:30.259 
really this is fantastic for them they
can<00:03:25.709> do<00:03:25.890> very<00:03:26.670> cool<00:03:27.510> stuff<00:03:27.840> I<00:03:28.970> think<00:03:29.970> we<00:03:30.090> have<00:03:30.120> a

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:30.269 
can do very cool stuff I think we have a

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:33.410 
can do very cool stuff I think we have a
real<00:03:30.570> commitment<00:03:30.959> that<00:03:31.560> it<00:03:31.829> does<00:03:32.549> take<00:03:33.090> a

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 
real commitment that it does take a

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:37.610 
real commitment that it does take a
village<00:03:33.450> to<00:03:34.340> educate<00:03:35.340> anyone<00:03:35.610> and<00:03:36.209> so<00:03:37.049> we

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
village to educate anyone and so we

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:40.310 
village to educate anyone and so we
envision<00:03:38.310> the<00:03:38.700> outreach<00:03:39.480> program<00:03:40.019> at<00:03:40.260> the

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:40.320 
envision the outreach program at the

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:43.430 
envision the outreach program at the
engineering<00:03:41.310> research<00:03:41.790> center<00:03:42.239> as<00:03:42.420> having<00:03:43.290> a

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 
engineering research center as having a

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.710 
engineering research center as having a
brigade<00:03:43.950> of<00:03:44.160> mentors<00:03:44.850> it's<00:03:45.360> such<00:03:45.510> a<00:03:45.540> small

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
brigade of mentors it's such a small

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.060 
brigade of mentors it's such a small
amount<00:03:45.870> we<00:03:46.170> really<00:03:46.410> do<00:03:46.560> need<00:03:46.769> to<00:03:46.859> make<00:03:47.040> sure

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:47.070 
amount we really do need to make sure

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:50.050 
amount we really do need to make sure
that<00:03:47.459> its<00:03:47.579> exact<00:03:47.970> i<00:03:48.440> graduated<00:03:49.440> from<00:03:49.560> bravo

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:50.060 
that its exact i graduated from bravo

that its exact i graduated from bravo
1998<00:03:51.060> being<00:03:51.660> a<00:03:51.750> mentor<00:03:52.109> to<00:03:52.170> all<00:03:52.530> the<00:03:52.709> young

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
1998 being a mentor to all the young

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:54.470 
1998 being a mentor to all the young
high<00:03:53.340> school<00:03:53.370> students<00:03:53.970> they<00:03:54.090> used<00:03:54.239> to<00:03:54.359> go

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
high school students they used to go

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.990 
high school students they used to go
through<00:03:54.690> Bravo<00:03:55.079> I<00:03:55.290> mean<00:03:55.440> it's<00:03:55.970> kind<00:03:56.970> of

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
through Bravo I mean it's kind of

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000 
through Bravo I mean it's kind of
completing<00:03:57.780> a<00:03:57.840> circle<00:03:58.290> in<00:03:58.500> that<00:03:58.709> you<00:03:58.980> know

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 
completing a circle in that you know

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:01.340 
completing a circle in that you know
I've<00:03:59.220> received<00:03:59.670> a<00:03:59.820> lot<00:03:59.850> of<00:04:00.030> mentorship<00:04:00.870> and

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:01.350 
I've received a lot of mentorship and

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:03.830 
I've received a lot of mentorship and
help<00:04:01.560> or<00:04:01.829> whatnot<00:04:02.010> and<00:04:02.430> then<00:04:02.609> now<00:04:02.790> it<00:04:03.180> makes<00:04:03.690> me

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 
help or whatnot and then now it makes me

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.539 
help or whatnot and then now it makes me
feel<00:04:03.989> even<00:04:04.140> more<00:04:04.290> grown<00:04:04.769> to<00:04:05.040> actually<00:04:05.400> be<00:04:05.519> able

00:04:05.539 --> 00:04:05.549 
feel even more grown to actually be able

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:07.099 
feel even more grown to actually be able
to<00:04:05.730> teach<00:04:05.940> the<00:04:06.120> next<00:04:06.269> generation<00:04:06.480> of

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:07.109 
to teach the next generation of

00:04:07.109 --> 00:04:09.560 
to teach the next generation of
scientists<00:04:07.799> and<00:04:07.980> hopefully<00:04:08.370> they<00:04:08.549> decide<00:04:09.540> to

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:09.570 
scientists and hopefully they decide to

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:12.140 
scientists and hopefully they decide to
stay<00:04:09.989> in<00:04:10.170> research<00:04:10.620> so<00:04:11.400> we<00:04:11.489> really<00:04:11.730> need<00:04:11.970> their

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
stay in research so we really need their

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:14.660 
stay in research so we really need their
help<00:04:12.440> but<00:04:13.440> now<00:04:13.620> the<00:04:13.650> relationship<00:04:14.459> with

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:14.670
