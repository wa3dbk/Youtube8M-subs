00:00:45.459 --> 00:00:45.469 
invest for energy is a lot for and

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:47.479 
invest for energy is a lot for and
normally<00:00:46.469> ex<00:00:46.649> there's<00:00:46.950> nothing<00:00:47.280> all<00:00:47.460> that

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489

special<00:00:47.670> about<00:00:48.270> them<00:00:48.770> and<00:00:49.770> then<00:00:49.980> mega<00:00:50.309> groudon

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
special about them and then mega groudon

special about them and then mega groudon
would<00:00:51.180> be<00:00:51.329> annoying<00:00:51.660> because<00:00:52.230> you'd<00:00:52.710> have<00:00:52.890> to

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
would be annoying because you'd have to

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:54.830 
would be annoying because you'd have to
use<00:00:53.160> a<00:00:53.190> spirit<00:00:53.760> link<00:00:53.969> and<00:00:54.239> you<00:00:54.510> wouldn't<00:00:54.750> be

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
use a spirit link and you wouldn't be

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.049 
use a spirit link and you wouldn't be
able<00:00:54.960> to<00:00:55.079> use<00:00:55.199> muscle<00:00:55.590> band<00:00:55.820> and<00:00:56.820> without

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
able to use muscle band and without

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.540 
able to use muscle band and without
muscle<00:00:57.300> band<00:00:57.629> his<00:00:57.989> attack<00:00:58.649> without<00:00:58.920> a<00:00:59.280> stadium

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
muscle band his attack without a stadium

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.450 
muscle band his attack without a stadium
card<00:00:59.910> and<00:01:00.090> play<00:01:00.829> wouldn't<00:01:01.829> be<00:01:01.949> all<00:01:02.070> that<00:01:02.100> great

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
card and play wouldn't be all that great

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.579 
card and play wouldn't be all that great
because<00:01:02.550> it's<00:01:02.820> a<00:01:02.879> 100-plus<00:01:03.510> does<00:01:03.870> 100<00:01:04.409> more

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
because it's a 100-plus does 100 more

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.950 
because it's a 100-plus does 100 more
for<00:01:05.189> Stadium<00:01:05.610> car<00:01:05.790> didn't<00:01:06.030> play<00:01:06.180> then<00:01:06.810> you

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
for Stadium car didn't play then you

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.399 
for Stadium car didn't play then you
discard<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:07.470> stadium<00:01:07.830> so<00:01:08.990> he'd<00:01:09.990> have<00:01:10.020> to<00:01:10.260> run

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
discard the stadium so he'd have to run

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.890 
discard the stadium so he'd have to run
either<00:01:10.650> a<00:01:10.830> lot<00:01:11.189> of<00:01:11.340> stadium<00:01:11.729> cards<00:01:11.939> or<00:01:12.450> have

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
either a lot of stadium cards or have

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.200 
either a lot of stadium cards or have
some<00:01:13.229> way<00:01:13.380> to<00:01:13.409> make<00:01:13.650> him<00:01:13.860> stronger<00:01:14.220> without

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
some way to make him stronger without

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.210 
some way to make him stronger without
the<00:01:15.390> stadium<00:01:15.750> cards<00:01:15.960> which<00:01:16.229> is<00:01:16.380> really<00:01:16.710> hard

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
the stadium cards which is really hard

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.390 
the stadium cards which is really hard
because<00:01:17.490> you<00:01:18.360> need<00:01:18.780> for<00:01:19.200> strong<00:01:19.500> energy<00:01:19.920> just

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
because you need for strong energy just

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.609 
because you need for strong energy just
to<00:01:20.580> put<00:01:20.790> it<00:01:20.909> up<00:01:21.060> to<00:01:21.500> 180<00:01:22.500> you<00:01:23.100> can't<00:01:23.369> run<00:01:24.619> you

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
to put it up to 180 you can't run you

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.219 
to put it up to 180 you can't run you
wouldn't<00:01:25.860> be<00:01:25.950> able<00:01:26.009> to<00:01:26.100> run<00:01:26.810> finding<00:01:27.810> stadium

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
wouldn't be able to run finding stadium

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.700 
wouldn't be able to run finding stadium
that<00:01:28.380> well<00:01:28.590> it'd<00:01:28.979> be<00:01:29.340> down<00:01:29.640> really<00:01:30.540> quickly<00:01:30.840> of

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
that well it'd be down really quickly of

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.260 
that well it'd be down really quickly of
course<00:01:31.950> there<00:01:32.189> there's<00:01:32.640> the<00:01:32.909> fact<00:01:33.090> that

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
course there there's the fact that

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.649 
course there there's the fact that
rather<00:01:33.570> than<00:01:33.720> improve<00:01:34.710> your<00:01:34.950> attack<00:01:35.189> by<00:01:35.490> to

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:35.659 
rather than improve your attack by to

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:39.950 
rather than improve your attack by to
the<00:01:36.659> 20<00:01:37.280> it<00:01:38.280> improves<00:01:38.640> it<00:01:38.820> by<00:01:38.970> 100<00:01:39.659> which<00:01:39.810> is

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
the 20 it improves it by 100 which is

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:46.249 
the 20 it improves it by 100 which is
amazing<00:01:40.400> but<00:01:41.400> it's<00:01:42.180> just<00:01:42.509> a<00:01:44.810> prom<00:01:45.810> agreed<00:01:46.079> on

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
amazing but it's just a prom agreed on

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.789 
amazing but it's just a prom agreed on
is<00:01:46.500> not<00:01:47.180> that<00:01:48.180> great<00:01:48.420> of<00:01:48.479> a<00:01:48.659> mega<00:01:48.899> in<00:01:49.140> my<00:01:49.350> book<00:01:49.590> I

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
is not that great of a mega in my book I

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.920 
is not that great of a mega in my book I
mean<00:01:50.040> it's<00:01:50.220> a<00:01:50.399> lot<00:01:50.640> of<00:01:50.759> damage<00:01:51.030> but<00:01:51.390> he's<00:01:51.750> going

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
mean it's a lot of damage but he's going

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.260 
mean it's a lot of damage but he's going
to<00:01:51.990> be<00:01:52.049> just<00:01:52.350> like<00:01:52.470> mega<00:01:52.799> Charizard<00:01:53.430> people

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
to be just like mega Charizard people

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:55.760 
to be just like mega Charizard people

that's<00:01:56.070> a<00:01:56.189> ton<00:01:56.369> of<00:01:56.399> damage<00:01:56.640> and<00:01:57.290> tried<00:01:58.290> to<00:01:58.409> run

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
that's a ton of damage and tried to run

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.190 
that's a ton of damage and tried to run
him<00:01:58.680> and<00:01:58.890> it's<00:01:59.250> never<00:01:59.399> going<00:01:59.610> to<00:01:59.670> work<00:02:00.200> alright

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
him and it's never going to work alright

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.050 
him and it's never going to work alright
so<00:02:01.409> we're<00:02:01.530> focusing<00:02:01.979> on<00:02:02.070> rip<00:02:02.340> claw<00:02:02.579> for<00:02:02.850> 30

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
so we're focusing on rip claw for 30

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.030 
so we're focusing on rip claw for 30

when you start thinking about how you

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.270 
when you start thinking about how you

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
can make it stronger with a muscle

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.730 
can make it stronger with a muscle

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.030 
does one 10 20 x + 92 and 90 x that's
not<00:02:26.880> enough<00:02:27.000> for<00:02:27.120> a<00:02:27.270> one-hit<00:02:27.630> ko<00:02:27.840> on<00:02:28.200> most

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
not enough for a one-hit ko on most

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.360 
not enough for a one-hit ko on most
anything<00:02:29.340> really<00:02:30.530> but<00:02:31.530> it's<00:02:31.800> still<00:02:32.130> pretty

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
anything really but it's still pretty

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.830 
anything really but it's still pretty
strong<00:02:34.610> because<00:02:35.610> of<00:02:35.880> the<00:02:36.030> energy<00:02:36.239> discard

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
strong because of the energy discard

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.410 
strong because of the energy discard
right<00:02:37.020> there<00:02:37.459> it<00:02:38.459> can<00:02:38.670> do<00:02:38.790> a<00:02:38.819> lot<00:02:38.910> of<00:02:39.120> damage

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
right there it can do a lot of damage

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.840 
right there it can do a lot of damage
and<00:02:39.660> then<00:02:40.020> mess<00:02:40.530> up<00:02:40.770> your<00:02:40.950> opponent<00:02:41.400> bad<00:02:41.580> it

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
and then mess up your opponent bad it

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:43.460 
and then mess up your opponent bad it
doesn't<00:02:42.030> say<00:02:42.390> it<00:02:42.510> has<00:02:42.630> to<00:02:42.780> be<00:02:42.870> a<00:02:42.900> basic<00:02:43.319> energy

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
doesn't say it has to be a basic energy

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.949 
doesn't say it has to be a basic energy
so<00:02:44.340> if<00:02:44.489> they<00:02:44.670> have<00:02:44.880> a<00:02:44.910> double<00:02:45.330> colorless<00:02:45.660> on

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
so if they have a double colorless on

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:48.620 
so if they have a double colorless on
them<00:02:46.170> you<00:02:46.709> can<00:02:46.950> really<00:02:47.430> screw<00:02:48.150> with<00:02:48.420> them

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
them you can really screw with them

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:51.530 
them you can really screw with them
using<00:02:49.380> getting<00:02:50.370> rid<00:02:50.519> of<00:02:50.550> their<00:02:50.790> dce<00:02:51.150> there

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
using getting rid of their dce there

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.770 
using getting rid of their dce there
then<00:02:52.440> we<00:02:52.560> got<00:02:52.739> a<00:02:52.769> landra<00:02:53.400> CX<00:02:53.820> because<00:02:54.330> hail

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
then we got a landra CX because hail

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.250 
then we got a landra CX because hail
andres<00:02:55.380> is<00:02:55.530> amazing<00:02:56.100> that<00:02:56.580> hammerhead<00:02:57.260> 431

andres is amazing that hammerhead 431
energy<00:02:58.680> and<00:02:58.890> then<00:02:59.280> it<00:02:59.400> does<00:02:59.550> 30<00:02:59.850> to<00:03:00.060> one<00:03:00.180> of

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:00.269

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:35.780 
opponent's energy and using garbo toxin
well<00:03:34.560> what<00:03:34.709> can<00:03:34.829> they<00:03:34.980> do<00:03:35.040> they<00:03:35.430> can't<00:03:35.670> attack

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
well what can they do they can't attack

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:38.539 
well what can they do they can't attack

they can't use abilities they are messed

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:42.440 
they can't use abilities they are messed
up<00:03:39.320> so<00:03:40.320> as<00:03:40.590> you<00:03:40.709> can<00:03:40.799> see<00:03:41.010> ground<00:03:41.370> on<00:03:41.579> actually

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:42.450 
up so as you can see ground on actually

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:44.900 
up so as you can see ground on actually
is<00:03:42.690> kind<00:03:43.049> of<00:03:43.170> strong<00:03:43.440> so<00:03:43.920> running<00:03:44.220> three<00:03:44.790> of

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910 
is kind of strong so running three of

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:49.190 
is kind of strong so running three of
him<00:03:45.140> 22<00:03:46.140> on<00:03:46.380> garbodor<00:03:47.220> chain<00:03:47.640> and<00:03:47.880> then<00:03:48.690> to

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.200 
him 22 on garbodor chain and then to

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.250 
him 22 on garbodor chain and then to
landris<00:03:49.910> running<00:03:50.910> for<00:03:51.269> strong<00:03:51.570> energy<00:03:51.989> and

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
landris running for strong energy and
