00:01:50.739 --> 00:01:55.510
 knock a little shape on the table 

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:57.790

 put this design in the oven 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:11.800
 warmed to 170 degrees somewhere through 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:13.630
 an hour you need to see how things are there 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:17.170
 depending on the oven for cooking 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:19.710

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:26.800
 slightly moving inside 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:28.390
 but after 10 hours of retention in 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:31.210
 the refrigerator should freeze 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:40.870
 move the knife along the wall to avoid 

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:43.330
