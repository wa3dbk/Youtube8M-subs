wiring this wire it feels like a
shoelace<00:01:59.700> kind<00:02:00.240> of<00:02:00.360> it's<00:02:00.509> extremely<00:02:01.110> skinny

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
shoelace kind of it's extremely skinny

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.499 
shoelace kind of it's extremely skinny
and<00:02:01.649> it<00:02:02.250> feels<00:02:02.430> like<00:02:02.610> a<00:02:02.640> shoelace<00:02:02.909> and<00:02:03.119> I

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
and it feels like a shoelace and I

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:06.800 
and it feels like a shoelace and I
believe<00:02:03.890> they<00:02:04.890> put<00:02:05.130> this<00:02:05.310> so<00:02:06.090> it<00:02:06.479> doesn't

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
believe they put this so it doesn't

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.630 
believe they put this so it doesn't
break<00:02:06.930> like<00:02:07.469> the<00:02:07.740> old<00:02:07.890> skull<00:02:08.160> candys<00:02:08.520> they

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
break like the old skull candys they

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.430 
break like the old skull candys they
used<00:02:08.819> to<00:02:08.970> break<00:02:09.239> like<00:02:09.509> so<00:02:09.720> much<00:02:09.929> because<00:02:10.289> the

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
used to break like so much because the

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.920 
used to break like so much because the
wiring<00:02:10.830> was<00:02:10.950> not<00:02:11.160> that<00:02:11.370> great<00:02:11.550> and<00:02:11.849> with

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.709 
wiring was not that great and with
it's<00:02:13.200> awesome<00:02:13.760> it's<00:02:14.760> really<00:02:14.969> strong<00:02:15.420> so<00:02:15.480> it's

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:15.719 
it's awesome it's really strong so it's

00:02:15.719 --> 00:02:20.209 
it's awesome it's really strong so it's
