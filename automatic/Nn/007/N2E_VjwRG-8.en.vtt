intelligent every time she would talk

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.589 
intelligent every time she would talk
about<00:00:24.720> God<00:00:25.650> and<00:00:25.920> the<00:00:26.010> details<00:00:26.519> of<00:00:26.760> her<00:00:27.630> life<00:00:27.660> in

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:29.599 
about God and the details of her life in

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:33.740 
about God and the details of her life in
heaven<00:00:30.599> how<00:00:30.990> she<00:00:31.050> described<00:00:31.710> it<00:00:32.090> it<00:00:33.090> wasn't<00:00:33.330> it

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
heaven how she described it it wasn't it

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.100 
heaven how she described it it wasn't it
was<00:00:33.960> very<00:00:34.620> very<00:00:34.920> sophisticated<00:00:35.430> and<00:00:36.239> I<00:00:36.660> knew

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
was very very sophisticated and I knew

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.509 
was very very sophisticated and I knew
that<00:00:37.470> at<00:00:37.800> that<00:00:37.890> time<00:00:38.420> nobody<00:00:39.420> else<00:00:39.930> could<00:00:40.350> have

00:00:40.509 --> 00:00:40.519 
that at that time nobody else could have

00:00:40.519 --> 00:00:45.500 
that at that time nobody else could have
influenced<00:00:41.989> her<00:00:42.989> in<00:00:43.400> that<00:00:44.400> way<00:00:44.460> because<00:00:44.970> we

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
influenced her in that way because we

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.090 
influenced her in that way because we
led<00:00:45.989> a<00:00:46.019> closed<00:00:46.530> life<00:00:46.830> as<00:00:47.159> time<00:00:47.699> went<00:00:47.909> on<00:00:48.059> we

led a closed life as time went on we

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.899 
led a closed life as time went on we
paid<00:00:50.100> more<00:00:50.280> attention<00:00:50.339> to<00:00:50.760> it<00:00:50.909> and<00:00:51.180> then<00:00:51.440> she

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:52.909 
paid more attention to it and then she

00:00:52.909 --> 00:00:55.729 
paid more attention to it and then she
it<00:00:53.909> developed<00:00:54.420> into<00:00:54.600> painting<00:00:55.110> and<00:00:55.290> then

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
it developed into painting and then

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.240 
it developed into painting and then
