of<00:02:25.350> downy<00:02:25.650> mildew<00:02:26.300> there's<00:02:27.300> been<00:02:27.510> black<00:02:27.780> rot

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
of downy mildew there's been black rot

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.949 
of downy mildew there's been black rot
it's<00:02:28.470> been<00:02:28.650> botrytis<00:02:29.040> and<00:02:29.600> also<00:02:30.600> powdery

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
it's been botrytis and also powdery

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:33.440 
it's been botrytis and also powdery
mildew<00:02:31.380> and<00:02:31.650> as<00:02:32.250> we<00:02:32.400> get<00:02:32.580> close<00:02:32.850> to<00:02:33.000> harvest

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
mildew and as we get close to harvest

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.960 
mildew and as we get close to harvest
there<00:02:33.690> are<00:02:33.750> a<00:02:33.810> whole<00:02:33.930> bunch<00:02:33.959> of<00:02:34.260> microns<00:02:34.970> that

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
there are a whole bunch of microns that

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.500 
there are a whole bunch of microns that
become<00:02:36.540> problems<00:02:37.050> off<00:02:37.880> this<00:02:38.880> is<00:02:39.090> a<00:02:39.120> trap<00:02:39.480> that

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
become problems off this is a trap that

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.949 
become problems off this is a trap that
has<00:02:39.900> the<00:02:40.080> great<00:02:40.320> very<00:02:40.590> ma<00:02:40.770> pheromone<00:02:41.370> and<00:02:41.959> we

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
has the great very ma pheromone and we

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:48.650 
has the great very ma pheromone and we
have<00:02:43.230> in<00:02:43.920> the<00:02:45.050> in<00:02:46.050> the<00:02:46.320> block<00:02:46.680> Oh<00:02:47.060> probably<00:02:48.060> 200

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
have in the in the block Oh probably 200

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:52.430 
have in the in the block Oh probably 200
pheromone<00:02:49.500> ties<00:02:50.330> so<00:02:51.330> we're<00:02:51.750> releasing<00:02:52.049> the

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
pheromone ties so we're releasing the

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.280 
pheromone ties so we're releasing the
pheromone<00:02:53.239> this<00:02:54.239> is<00:02:54.450> the<00:02:54.600> pheromone<00:02:54.930> produced

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
pheromone this is the pheromone produced

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.860 
pheromone this is the pheromone produced
by<00:02:55.440> the<00:02:55.500> female<00:02:56.000> the<00:02:57.000> sex<00:02:57.269> pheromone<00:02:57.690> is

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
by the female the sex pheromone is

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.770 
by the female the sex pheromone is
supposed<00:02:58.590> to<00:02:58.739> confuse<00:02:59.190> the<00:02:59.400> males<00:02:59.640> so<00:03:00.570> they

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
supposed to confuse the males so they

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.440 
supposed to confuse the males so they
can't<00:03:01.049> find<00:03:01.410> the<00:03:01.650> females<00:03:02.010> to<00:03:02.160> mate<00:03:02.340> with<00:03:02.450> so

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
can't find the females to mate with so

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:08.449 
can't find the females to mate with so
the<00:03:03.570> population<00:03:04.200> crashes<00:03:04.980> and<00:03:05.720> so<00:03:06.720> far<00:03:07.459> we

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459 
the population crashes and so far we

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:11.449 
the population crashes and so far we
have<00:03:09.239> had<00:03:09.269> very<00:03:09.750> few<00:03:09.840> great<00:03:10.560> Barry<00:03:10.860> moths<00:03:11.160> in

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
have had very few great Barry moths in

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:15.860 
have had very few great Barry moths in
the<00:03:12.299> traps<00:03:12.980> far<00:03:13.980> fewer<00:03:14.250> than<00:03:14.519> last<00:03:14.730> year<00:03:15.180> so<00:03:15.810> it

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
the traps far fewer than last year so it

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:18.620 
the traps far fewer than last year so it
looks<00:03:16.110> like<00:03:16.320> it's<00:03:16.530> really<00:03:16.860> reducing<00:03:17.640> the

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
looks like it's really reducing the

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:21.530 
looks like it's really reducing the
number<00:03:18.810> of<00:03:18.989> males<00:03:19.950> that<00:03:20.370> actually<00:03:21.180> get<00:03:21.360> into

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
number of males that actually get into

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:24.020 
number of males that actually get into

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
with this female sex pheromone we have

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:33.080 
with this female sex pheromone we have
them<00:03:29.250> every<00:03:30.170> 8<00:03:31.170> feet<00:03:31.470> or<00:03:31.650> so<00:03:31.860> at<00:03:32.760> this<00:03:33.030> height

end of the second generation and we're
seeing<00:03:51.560> you<00:03:52.560> know<00:03:52.650> nothing<00:03:53.340> in<00:03:53.459> the<00:03:53.549> trap<00:03:53.790> this

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
seeing you know nothing in the trap this

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:54.590 
seeing you know nothing in the trap this
week

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:54.600 
week

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:58.210 
week
this<00:03:55.290> location<00:03:55.890> had<00:03:56.070> very<00:03:56.310> few<00:03:56.870> this<00:03:57.870> year

00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:58.220 
this location had very few this year

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:00.830 
this location had very few this year
it's<00:03:59.220> one<00:03:59.430> of<00:03:59.520> the<00:03:59.580> one<00:03:59.910> of<00:04:00.030> the<00:04:00.090> locations

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
it's one of the one of the locations

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:03.590 
it's one of the one of the locations
with<00:04:01.260> the<00:04:01.500> with<00:04:01.830> the<00:04:01.860> sex<00:04:02.250> pheromone<00:04:02.670> other

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:03.600 
with the with the sex pheromone other

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:05.660 
with the with the sex pheromone other
places<00:04:04.230> were<00:04:04.350> trapping<00:04:04.710> but<00:04:05.160> we<00:04:05.250> don't<00:04:05.460> have

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:05.670 
places were trapping but we don't have

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:08.510 
places were trapping but we don't have
the<00:04:05.820> pheromone<00:04:06.300> and<00:04:06.570> we<00:04:07.080> getting<00:04:07.650> 50<00:04:07.980> or<00:04:08.100> 60

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:08.520 
the pheromone and we getting 50 or 60

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:11.740 
the pheromone and we getting 50 or 60
miles<00:04:09.300> a<00:04:09.540> week<00:04:09.570> during<00:04:10.080> the<00:04:10.230> to<00:04:10.440> peak<00:04:10.740> periods

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:11.750 
miles a week during the to peak periods

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:14.900 
miles a week during the to peak periods
so<00:04:12.750> this<00:04:12.960> method<00:04:13.410> does<00:04:13.650> seem<00:04:14.070> to<00:04:14.100> be<00:04:14.220> reducing

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:14.910 
so this method does seem to be reducing

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:18.050 
so this method does seem to be reducing
the<00:04:15.720> number<00:04:15.900> of<00:04:16.280> laws<00:04:17.280> that<00:04:17.310> get<00:04:17.700> into<00:04:17.850> the

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:18.060 
the number of laws that get into the

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:20.630 
the number of laws that get into the
interior<00:04:18.300> of<00:04:18.510> the<00:04:18.690> block<00:04:18.930> in<00:04:19.260> this<00:04:20.160> Chardonnay

interior of the block in this Chardonnay

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:23.600 
interior of the block in this Chardonnay
block<00:04:20.989> we<00:04:21.989> had<00:04:22.140> a<00:04:22.170> pretty<00:04:22.440> big<00:04:22.740> powdery<00:04:23.190> mildew

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610 
block we had a pretty big powdery mildew

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:26.270 
block we had a pretty big powdery mildew
in<00:04:23.940> this<00:04:24.210> station<00:04:24.420> which<00:04:25.350> started<00:04:25.860> around<00:04:26.070> the

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:26.280 
in this station which started around the

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:30.050 
in this station which started around the
10th<00:04:26.610> to<00:04:27.330> the<00:04:27.450> 15th<00:04:27.840> of<00:04:27.990> July<00:04:28.430> came<00:04:29.430> on<00:04:29.490> very

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:30.060 
10th to the 15th of July came on very

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:34.970 
10th to the 15th of July came on very
suddenly<00:04:31.220> but<00:04:32.220> the<00:04:32.570> inoculum<00:04:33.570> was<00:04:34.500> to<00:04:34.680> snuck

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:34.980 
suddenly but the inoculum was to snuck

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:37.550 
suddenly but the inoculum was to snuck
through<00:04:35.310> many<00:04:35.850> weeks<00:04:36.060> before<00:04:36.420> that<00:04:36.630> and<00:04:37.500> the
