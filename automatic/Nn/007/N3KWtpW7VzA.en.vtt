the<00:01:27.509> time<00:01:27.869> gap<00:01:28.200> there<00:01:29.009> you<00:01:29.220> go<00:01:29.460> it<00:01:29.670> happens

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
the time gap there you go it happens

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.630 
the time gap there you go it happens
right<00:01:30.420> after<00:01:30.780> the<00:01:31.229> fight<00:01:31.590> all<00:01:31.920> that<00:01:32.369> last

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
right after the fight all that last

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.990 
right after the fight all that last
episode<00:01:33.180> the<00:01:33.360> DBZ<00:01:33.810> is<00:01:33.930> kind<00:01:34.409> of<00:01:34.619> irrelevant

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.000 
episode the DBZ is kind of irrelevant

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.980 
episode the DBZ is kind of irrelevant
pretty<00:01:36.000> much<00:01:36.210> so<00:01:36.390> I<00:01:36.420> guess<00:01:36.600> in<00:01:36.780> a<00:01:36.840> way<00:01:36.869> you

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
pretty much so I guess in a way you

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.960 
pretty much so I guess in a way you
could<00:01:37.200> look<00:01:37.320> at<00:01:37.409> it<00:01:37.560> it's<00:01:37.740> not<00:01:37.860> canon<00:01:38.460> even

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
could look at it it's not canon even

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.120 
could look at it it's not canon even
though<00:01:39.030> the<00:01:39.119> entire<00:01:39.420> DVD<00:01:39.780> series<00:01:40.140> is<00:01:40.380> canon

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
though the entire DVD series is canon

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.800 
though the entire DVD series is canon
you<00:01:41.520> can<00:01:41.670> look<00:01:41.790> at<00:01:41.850> the<00:01:41.909> last<00:01:42.090> episode<00:01:42.240> two<00:01:42.659> not

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
you can look at the last episode two not

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.760 
you can look at the last episode two not

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
boo so some of the DBS could take place

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.380 
boo so some of the DBS could take place

either<00:01:54.930> that<00:01:54.960> or<00:01:55.170> the<00:01:55.500> kids<00:01:55.740> don't<00:01:56.009> age<00:01:56.630> you'd

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
either that or the kids don't age you'd

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.149 
either that or the kids don't age you'd
be<00:01:57.780> a<00:01:57.810> little<00:01:58.140> Arella<00:01:58.439> it<00:01:58.680> would<00:01:58.770> be<00:01:58.860> really

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
be a little Arella it would be really

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.670 
be a little Arella it would be really
there<00:02:00.090> be<00:02:00.180> a<00:02:00.210> giant<00:02:00.540> plot<00:02:00.930> holes<00:02:01.170> if<00:02:01.350> the<00:02:01.469> kids

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
there be a giant plot holes if the kids

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.440 
there be a giant plot holes if the kids
didn't<00:02:01.860> age<00:02:01.979> because<00:02:02.280> we<00:02:02.369> go<00:02:02.610> up<00:02:02.729> Goku<00:02:03.420> and

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
didn't age because we go up Goku and

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.450 
didn't age because we go up Goku and
Vegeta<00:02:03.659> were<00:02:04.110> kids<00:02:04.380> they<00:02:04.799> Egypt<00:02:05.250> to<00:02:05.340> the

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
Vegeta were kids they Egypt to the

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.430 
Vegeta were kids they Egypt to the
adults<00:02:05.820> that<00:02:05.909> they<00:02:06.030> were<00:02:06.180> now<00:02:06.360> but<00:02:06.509> they<00:02:06.630> stop

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:07.440 
adults that they were now but they stop

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.560 
adults that they were now but they stop
so<00:02:07.590> it<00:02:07.650> seems<00:02:07.860> like<00:02:08.010> sayings<00:02:08.490> do<00:02:08.760> age<00:02:09.060> but<00:02:09.420> they

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:09.570 
so it seems like sayings do age but they

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:11.960 
so it seems like sayings do age but they
stop<00:02:09.900> at<00:02:10.140> a<00:02:10.170> certain<00:02:10.410> point<00:02:10.950> whether<00:02:11.700> is<00:02:11.940> it

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
stop at a certain point whether is it

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.580 
stop at a certain point whether is it
you<00:02:12.300> know<00:02:12.450> we're<00:02:12.690> go<00:02:12.840> kuh<00:02:13.080> and<00:02:13.260> Vegeta

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
you know we're go kuh and Vegeta

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.440 
you know we're go kuh and Vegeta

assains<00:02:15.810> don't<00:02:16.290> age<00:02:16.530> so<00:02:17.100> I'm<00:02:17.880> guest

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150

seem to be it looks like it's wease I

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.400 
seem to be it looks like it's wease I
mean<00:02:45.000> it<00:02:45.060> looks<00:02:45.180> like<00:02:45.300> a<00:02:45.330> female<00:02:45.630> lease<00:02:46.080> and

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.050 
then it looks like a fatter beerus so
maybe<00:02:48.660> it's<00:02:48.900> like<00:02:48.990> a<00:02:49.050> different<00:02:49.380> time<00:02:50.040> I<00:02:50.460> don't

else that got a recreation you know the

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:41.120 
make this into God of recreation the god
of<00:04:39.720> divine<00:04:40.260> rice<00:04:40.500> I<00:04:40.530> don't<00:04:40.830> know<00:04:40.890> something

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:41.130 
of divine rice I don't know something

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:42.440 
of divine rice I don't know something
like<00:04:41.310> that<00:04:41.520> you<00:04:41.640> know<00:04:41.670> so<00:04:42.000> what<00:04:42.120> make<00:04:42.270> any

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:42.450 
like that you know so what make any

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:44.450 
like that you know so what make any
sense<00:04:42.720> to<00:04:42.780> me<00:04:42.900> or<00:04:43.350> anybody<00:04:43.560> else<00:04:43.860> you<00:04:44.430> know

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:44.460 
sense to me or anybody else you know

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:48.700 
sense to me or anybody else you know
that<00:04:44.910> there<00:04:45.660> would<00:04:45.840> be<00:04:46.040> to<00:04:47.040> be<00:04:47.790> racist<00:04:48.000> so

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:48.710 
that there would be to be racist so

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:51.620 
that there would be to be racist so
probably<00:04:49.710> an<00:04:50.070> alternate<00:04:50.669> universe<00:04:50.700> makes

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:51.630 
probably an alternate universe makes

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:53.270 
probably an alternate universe makes
more<00:04:51.930> sense<00:04:52.200> than<00:04:52.380> them<00:04:52.590> being<00:04:52.800> in<00:04:52.980> the<00:04:53.070> same

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:53.280 
more sense than them being in the same

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:55.040 
more sense than them being in the same
universe<00:04:54.120> i'm<00:04:54.300> gonna<00:04:54.419> go<00:04:54.480> based<00:04:54.660> on<00:04:54.750> safety

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:55.050 
universe i'm gonna go based on safety

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:56.960 
universe i'm gonna go based on safety
from<00:04:55.680> the<00:04:55.860> ultra<00:04:56.220> news<00:04:56.370> I'm<00:04:56.550> calling<00:04:56.880> her

from the ultra news I'm calling her

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:58.460 
from the ultra news I'm calling her
right<00:04:57.000> now<00:04:57.180> be<00:04:57.570> anything<00:04:57.870> could<00:04:58.110> for<00:04:58.230> him<00:04:58.320> like

00:04:58.460 --> 00:04:58.470 
right now be anything could for him like

00:04:58.470 --> 00:04:59.990 
right now be anything could for him like
that<00:04:58.590> Wes<00:04:58.980> swear<00:04:59.280> to<00:04:59.340> god<00:04:59.490> I'm<00:04:59.669> just<00:04:59.880> naked

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:00.000 
that Wes swear to god I'm just naked

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.409 
that Wes swear to god I'm just naked
video<00:05:00.300> saying<00:05:00.510> I<00:05:00.600> was<00:05:00.720> right<00:05:01.130> but<00:05:02.130> um<00:05:02.419> straight

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:03.419 
video saying I was right but um straight

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:05.270 
video saying I was right but um straight
up<00:05:03.570> though<00:05:03.780> I'm<00:05:04.050> gonna<00:05:04.440> go<00:05:04.620> based<00:05:04.860> off<00:05:05.070> the

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:05.280 
up though I'm gonna go based off the

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:06.740 
up though I'm gonna go based off the
alternate<00:05:05.700> universe<00:05:06.060> and<00:05:06.270> from<00:05:06.419> the<00:05:06.510> weeks

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:06.750 
alternate universe and from the weeks

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:08.870 
alternate universe and from the weeks
old<00:05:07.050> TV<00:05:07.410> versus<00:05:07.680> well<00:05:07.950> and<00:05:08.160> I<00:05:08.460> could<00:05:08.700> believe

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:08.880 
old TV versus well and I could believe

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:10.159 
old TV versus well and I could believe
being<00:05:09.180> an<00:05:09.270> alternative<00:05:09.690> is<00:05:09.780> because<00:05:09.960> you<00:05:10.050> know

00:05:10.159 --> 00:05:10.169 
being an alternative is because you know

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:11.420 
being an alternative is because you know
how<00:05:10.260> we<00:05:10.320> can<00:05:10.650> tell<00:05:10.710> bring<00:05:11.070> himself<00:05:11.220> to

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:11.430 
how we can tell bring himself to

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:13.220 
how we can tell bring himself to
anywhere<00:05:11.910> that<00:05:12.090> he<00:05:12.150> wanted<00:05:12.450> the<00:05:12.540> entire<00:05:12.900> solar

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:13.230 
anywhere that he wanted the entire solar

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:15.800 
anywhere that he wanted the entire solar
system<00:05:13.290> in<00:05:13.860> the<00:05:14.100> entire<00:05:14.310> galaxy<00:05:14.700> just<00:05:15.510> life

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:15.810 
system in the entire galaxy just life

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:17.930 
system in the entire galaxy just life
itself<00:05:16.260> he<00:05:16.440> can<00:05:16.620> teleport<00:05:16.830> anywhere<00:05:17.400> that<00:05:17.729> he

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:17.940 
itself he can teleport anywhere that he

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:20.120 
itself he can teleport anywhere that he
wants<00:05:18.330> of<00:05:18.450> course<00:05:18.960> it's<00:05:19.140> way<00:05:19.530> way<00:05:19.770> way<00:05:19.950> WAY

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:20.130 
wants of course it's way way way WAY

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:22.670 
wants of course it's way way way WAY
fast<00:05:20.490> I'm<00:05:20.970> gonna<00:05:21.090> took<00:05:21.330> them<00:05:21.540> from<00:05:21.780> the<00:05:22.320> planet

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:22.680 
fast I'm gonna took them from the planet

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:25.159 
fast I'm gonna took them from the planet
of<00:05:22.710> beerus<00:05:23.100> or<00:05:23.250> whatever<00:05:23.460> they<00:05:23.580> were<00:05:24.020> to<00:05:25.020> earth

00:05:25.159 --> 00:05:25.169 
of beerus or whatever they were to earth

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:29.120 
of beerus or whatever they were to earth
it<00:05:25.410> took<00:05:25.560> them<00:05:25.729> 23<00:05:26.729> minutes<00:05:27.450> when<00:05:28.410> roughly<00:05:28.890> I'm

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:29.130 
it took them 23 minutes when roughly I'm

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:30.380 
it took them 23 minutes when roughly I'm
not<00:05:29.400> gonna<00:05:29.550> do<00:05:29.729> the<00:05:29.820> math<00:05:30.000> so<00:05:30.150> I'm<00:05:30.210> gonna

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:30.390 
not gonna do the math so I'm gonna

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:32.630 
not gonna do the math so I'm gonna
straight<00:05:30.660> off<00:05:30.810> you<00:05:31.169> know<00:05:31.320> logical<00:05:32.190> physics

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:32.640 
straight off you know logical physics

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:34.430 
straight off you know logical physics
where<00:05:32.820> you<00:05:32.910> know<00:05:33.030> the<00:05:33.180> speed<00:05:33.360> of<00:05:33.419> light<00:05:33.540> they

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:34.440 
where you know the speed of light they

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:36.020 
where you know the speed of light they
are<00:05:34.470> much<00:05:34.919> faster<00:05:35.160> than<00:05:35.520> the<00:05:35.640> speed<00:05:35.669> of<00:05:35.880> light

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:36.030 
are much faster than the speed of light

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:38.690 
are much faster than the speed of light
and<00:05:36.450> it<00:05:37.080> becomes<00:05:37.290> the<00:05:37.500> actual<00:05:37.979> traveling<00:05:38.520> with

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:38.700 
and it becomes the actual traveling with

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:40.610 
and it becomes the actual traveling with
who<00:05:38.820> do<00:05:39.000> a<00:05:39.030> you<00:05:39.419> know<00:05:39.570> a<00:05:39.750> ship<00:05:40.110> a<00:05:40.290> machine

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:40.620 
who do a you know a ship a machine

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:42.680 
who do a you know a ship a machine
anything<00:05:41.160> it<00:05:41.550> would<00:05:41.729> take<00:05:42.000> maybe<00:05:42.240> three

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:42.690 
anything it would take maybe three

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:45.290 
anything it would take maybe three
billion<00:05:43.080> years<00:05:43.890> roughly<00:05:44.220> around<00:05:44.430> there<00:05:44.790> so

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:45.300 
billion years roughly around there so

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:48.740 
billion years roughly around there so
for<00:05:46.020> him<00:05:46.229> to<00:05:46.260> just<00:05:46.620> go<00:05:46.650> in<00:05:47.070> the<00:05:47.550> mass<00:05:47.760> time<00:05:48.510> of

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:48.750 
for him to just go in the mass time of

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:52.250 
for him to just go in the mass time of
three<00:05:49.050> billion<00:05:49.380> years<00:05:49.979> to<00:05:50.840> 23<00:05:51.840> minutes<00:05:52.169> from

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:52.260 
three billion years to 23 minutes from

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.020 
three billion years to 23 minutes from
his<00:05:52.380> teleporting<00:05:52.919> powers<00:05:52.950> and<00:05:53.430> capabilities

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:54.030 
his teleporting powers and capabilities

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:56.330 
his teleporting powers and capabilities
I<00:05:54.270> could<00:05:54.960> believe<00:05:55.110> the<00:05:55.470> other<00:05:55.650> weeks<00:05:55.979> coming

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:56.340 
I could believe the other weeks coming

00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:59.000 
I could believe the other weeks coming
through<00:05:56.790> there<00:05:57.290> and<00:05:58.290> their<00:05:58.620> alternate

00:05:59.000 --> 00:05:59.010 
through there and their alternate

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:00.740 
through there and their alternate
universe<00:05:59.430> was<00:05:59.669> in<00:05:59.880> maybe<00:06:00.270> or<00:06:00.450> roughly<00:06:00.630> around

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:00.750 
universe was in maybe or roughly around

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:02.450 
universe was in maybe or roughly around
maybe<00:06:00.960> an<00:06:01.110> hour<00:06:01.260> I'd<00:06:01.590> say<00:06:01.620> nothing<00:06:02.310> it's<00:06:02.430> a

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:02.460 
maybe an hour I'd say nothing it's a

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:03.830 
maybe an hour I'd say nothing it's a
completely<00:06:02.790> different<00:06:03.150> alternate<00:06:03.510> universe

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:03.840 
completely different alternate universe

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:07.490 
completely different alternate universe
i<00:06:04.050> would<00:06:04.200> say<00:06:04.320> maybe<00:06:04.470> about<00:06:04.590> an<00:06:04.860> hour<00:06:05.010> so<00:06:06.500> op

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:07.500 
i would say maybe about an hour so op

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:09.020 
i would say maybe about an hour so op
that<00:06:07.860> that's<00:06:08.100> it<00:06:08.310> that's<00:06:08.550> all<00:06:08.700> i<00:06:08.790> gotta<00:06:08.970> say

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:09.030 
that that's it that's all i gotta say

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:10.100 
that that's it that's all i gotta say
let<00:06:09.270> me<00:06:09.330> know<00:06:09.390> what<00:06:09.479> you<00:06:09.540> guys<00:06:09.660> think<00:06:09.870> about<00:06:09.990> it

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:10.110 
let me know what you guys think about it
