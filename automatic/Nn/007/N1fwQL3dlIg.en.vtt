this and thinking all of that flours
never<00:01:43.829> going<00:01:44.009> to<00:01:44.100> mix<00:01:44.220> in<00:01:44.369> it's<00:01:44.490> going<00:01:44.610> to<00:01:44.670> be

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
never going to mix in it's going to be

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.490 
never going to mix in it's going to be
far<00:01:44.850> too<00:01:45.000> thick<00:01:45.240> but<00:01:45.450> just<00:01:45.659> keep<00:01:46.350> your

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
far too thick but just keep your

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.319 
far too thick but just keep your
patience<00:01:47.009> and<00:01:47.189> keep<00:01:47.670> working<00:01:48.000> at<00:01:48.090> it<00:01:48.119> and

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
patience and keep working at it and

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.330 
patience and keep working at it and
it'll<00:01:48.659> go<00:01:48.810> and<00:01:48.930> eventually<00:01:49.140> in<00:01:49.770> goes<00:01:50.009> the<00:01:50.040> last

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
it'll go and eventually in goes the last

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.100 
it'll go and eventually in goes the last
bit<00:01:50.579> getting<00:01:51.149> tough<00:01:51.329> to<00:01:51.509> stir<00:01:51.659> now<00:01:51.869> it's<00:01:52.049> a

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
bit getting tough to stir now it's a

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.670 
bit getting tough to stir now it's a
good<00:01:52.229> little<00:01:52.350> bicep<00:01:53.250> workout<00:01:53.960> okay<00:01:54.960> and<00:01:55.290> we're

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
good little bicep workout okay and we're

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.440 
good little bicep workout okay and we're
just<00:01:55.770> about<00:01:56.040> there<00:01:56.100> so<00:01:56.729> the<00:01:56.850> very<00:01:57.030> last<00:01:57.090> thing

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
just about there so the very last thing

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.350 
just about there so the very last thing
that<00:01:57.479> goes<00:01:57.600> in<00:01:58.079> is<00:01:58.850> chocolate<00:01:59.850> which<00:02:00.329> is

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
that goes in is chocolate which is

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:01.940 
that goes in is chocolate which is
obviously<00:02:00.750> the<00:02:00.869> best<00:02:01.020> part

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
obviously the best part

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.230 
obviously the best part
shucks<00:02:02.950> all<00:02:03.100> that<00:02:03.250> in<00:02:03.400> there<00:02:03.610> we'll<00:02:03.940> give<00:02:04.060> it<00:02:04.090> a

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:04.240 
shucks all that in there we'll give it a

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:06.030 
shucks all that in there we'll give it a
very<00:02:04.450> quick<00:02:04.690> stir<00:02:04.990> we<00:02:05.170> want<00:02:05.320> to<00:02:05.409> avoid<00:02:05.740> the

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:06.040 
very quick stir we want to avoid the

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:07.649 
very quick stir we want to avoid the
chocolate<00:02:06.400> melting<00:02:06.940> too<00:02:07.150> much<00:02:07.360> because<00:02:07.600> I'll

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:07.659 
chocolate melting too much because I'll

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:08.790 
chocolate melting too much because I'll
see<00:02:07.780> that<00:02:07.900> I<00:02:07.930> kind<00:02:08.140> of<00:02:08.170> ruin<00:02:08.410> the<00:02:08.530> color<00:02:08.709> a

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:08.800 
see that I kind of ruin the color a

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.370 
see that I kind of ruin the color a
little<00:02:08.890> bit<00:02:09.069> so<00:02:09.399> we'll<00:02:09.550> just<00:02:09.729> very<00:02:09.940> quickly

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:10.380 
little bit so we'll just very quickly

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:13.440 
little bit so we'll just very quickly
try<00:02:11.380> and<00:02:11.560> get<00:02:11.709> that<00:02:11.890> folded<00:02:12.790> through<00:02:13.090> and<00:02:13.360> then

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
try and get that folded through and then

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.860 
try and get that folded through and then
it<00:02:13.540> can<00:02:13.660> go<00:02:13.810> straight<00:02:14.140> in<00:02:14.410> the<00:02:14.560> oven<00:02:15.690> that<00:02:16.690> does

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
it can go straight in the oven that does

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:19.590 
it can go straight in the oven that does
look<00:02:17.020> so<00:02:17.319> appetizing<00:02:17.530> already<00:02:18.400> I'm<00:02:19.120> very

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.050 
bit easier to slice through but that's

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:51.600 
bit easier to slice through but that's
not<00:02:50.200> how<00:02:50.290> we<00:02:50.350> do<00:02:50.530> it<00:02:50.680> we<00:02:50.890> just<00:02:51.069> like<00:02:51.190> to<00:02:51.310> dive<00:02:51.459> in
