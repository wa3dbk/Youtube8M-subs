00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
the places we go

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.260 
the places we go
we<00:00:16.980> don't<00:00:17.160> always<00:00:17.310> trust<00:00:17.609> the<00:00:17.760> piano<00:00:18.029> that

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
we don't always trust the piano that

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:19.490 
we don't always trust the piano that
they<00:00:18.420> have<00:00:18.630> it<00:00:18.960> might<00:00:19.080> have<00:00:19.230> a<00:00:19.260> couple

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
they have it might have a couple

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.200 
they have it might have a couple
clunkers<00:00:19.949> in<00:00:20.130> there<00:00:20.340> or<00:00:20.580> they<00:00:20.850> might<00:00:20.970> not<00:00:21.029> have

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
clunkers in there or they might not have

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:22.670 
clunkers in there or they might not have
a<00:00:21.390> piano<00:00:21.600> and<00:00:21.840> then<00:00:21.930> we<00:00:22.020> have<00:00:22.140> to<00:00:22.260> lug<00:00:22.410> our<00:00:22.560> own

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
a piano and then we have to lug our own

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.529 
a piano and then we have to lug our own
so<00:00:22.949> it's<00:00:23.130> just<00:00:23.250> easier<00:00:23.760> to<00:00:23.880> do<00:00:24.000> everything<00:00:24.269> on

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
so it's just easier to do everything on

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.470 
so it's just easier to do everything on
