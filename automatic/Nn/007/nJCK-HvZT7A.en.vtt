00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:21.820
 how do the pizza she had julia 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:24.930
 that they break the pizza growth 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:24.930
 I'll show you today 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.370
 probably not like me either 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:34.330
 stone oven at home but there is one 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:35.770
 simple trick how to do such a thing 

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:38.230
 similar effect 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:40.000
 That is, with a baking tray turned over 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:41.800
 with the effect upwards and gives the 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.150
 oven at a fairly high temperature 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.770
 that means we have to do the sheet metal well 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:46.420
 Preheat if we have the pid oven 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:48.550
 push the pizza out of it 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:50.140
 Crispy stone oven comes out the pizza 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:51.880
 July in Italy use it very much 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:54.280
 fine flour and that's super important 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:56.680
 for the pizza 000, this is called in 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:59.200
 Italy in Germany would be comparable 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:01.740
 the flour 405 that it definitely 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:03.760
 a little bit more familiar and that's what we are 

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:06.240
 Just like that on the countertop 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:08.770
 make a pile of mail just under 500 grams 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.080
 makes a small depression purely because 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:12.670
 First we have to crumble the yeast 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:15.210
 and the quasi activate with 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:15.210
 little heat 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.720
 lukewarm milk room temperature rich 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.550
 usually already at fischer yeast 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.720
 because dry yeast would take there 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:27.500
 we have to get a little higher 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.500
 have temperature 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:38.070
 my tip will be particularly crispy 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:39.690
 a little piece again why we 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:43.890
 is because alcohol and sugar-containing 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:45.240
 that makes the whole nice talk of 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.430
 case always said that he feels 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.530
 how are they because of popo and so on 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.930
 we already have and the little guy must 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:55.400
 Now a first 35 hours go 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:55.400
 as possible covered in a warm place 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:06.170
 then we look at what our detail 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:07.520
 always made a little bit more 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:08.260
 make the countertop then glue it 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.180
 not so full anymore 

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:13.810
 where the uncle once out nice 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.810
 risen 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:19.970
 and because just under 500 grams of flour water 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:22.130
 used for around and at three 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:27.040
 pizzas we thirds the colleagues 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:27.040
 this is the best way to participate 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:31.930
 would be two pages 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:43.030
 knead a small ball in front of us 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:46.450
 Go through and start again 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:50.680
 only with the fingers to work so 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:52.500
 press a bit flat and then 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:54.640
 our people come to work 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.190
 also a little flour again 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:03:00.000
 add 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:00.000
 This will help you to stick 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:08.870
 now can slip such we do 

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:14.890
 a normal margherita of the 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:14.890
 classic two ingredients tomato sauce 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:20.440
 nice to pass we have all 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:21.900
 we took normal brush tomatoes 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:25.390
 have herbs rosemary thyme 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:27.370
 basil salt pepper sugar tomato 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:29.650
 high acid content thus needs the 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:31.570
 sweet santos sugar as a counterpart 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:32.170
 nice to pass and a little 

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:33.370
 let edge 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:37.810
 right after that comes the 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:40.500
 pizza take high between mozzarella 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:44.080
 buffalo mozzarella cow milk mozzarella and 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:48.070
 just mature in shreds and beautiful 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:50.710
 The pizza is now missing me 

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:53.640
 pizza for about 56 minutes at the highest 

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:53.640
 temperature open
