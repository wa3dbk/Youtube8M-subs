00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.510 

all<00:01:17.530> right<00:01:17.770> got<00:01:18.130> the<00:01:18.250> probe<00:01:18.550> in<00:01:18.820> there

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:21.520 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:33.260 

the<00:01:22.240> what<00:01:22.450> can

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:50.730 

this<00:01:34.270> little<00:01:34.570> clamp<00:01:34.990> right<00:01:35.350> here

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:50.740 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:55.450 

did<00:01:51.740> you<00:01:52.520> don't<00:01:52.700> lose<00:01:52.910> our<00:01:53.090> probe<00:01:54.100> down<00:01:55.100> under

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:55.460 
did you don't lose our probe down under

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:08.649 
did you don't lose our probe down under
the<00:01:55.550> water<00:01:55.580> line

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:08.659 

00:02:08.659 --> 00:02:14.410 

right<00:02:09.659> at<00:02:09.920> 606<00:02:11.269> see<00:02:12.269> how<00:02:12.480> this<00:02:12.659> was<00:02:12.900> three<00:02:13.200> here

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
right at 606 see how this was three here

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.819 
right at 606 see how this was three here
105<00:02:15.420> so<00:02:15.750> there's<00:02:15.900> analogues<00:02:16.260> not<00:02:16.439> going<00:02:16.680> to

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:16.829 
105 so there's analogues not going to

00:02:16.829 --> 00:02:18.860 
105 so there's analogues not going to
back<00:02:17.040> but<00:02:17.730> this<00:02:17.879> right<00:02:18.060> here<00:02:18.120> I<00:02:18.299> can<00:02:18.599> clip<00:02:18.840> it

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
back but this right here I can clip it

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:24.289 
back but this right here I can clip it
on<00:02:19.049> my<00:02:19.200> side<00:02:21.200> walk<00:02:22.200> around<00:02:22.590> with<00:02:22.829> it<00:02:23.299> do

00:02:24.289 --> 00:02:24.299 
on my side walk around with it do

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:28.220 
on my side walk around with it do
whatever<00:02:24.540> I<00:02:24.720> want<00:02:25.579> when<00:02:26.579> it<00:02:26.670> hits<00:02:26.790> 160<00:02:27.569> it'll

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
whatever I want when it hits 160 it'll

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:35.100 
whatever I want when it hits 160 it'll
tell<00:02:28.409> me<00:02:28.439> it's<00:02:28.650> almost<00:02:28.829> done

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:36.900 

in<00:02:35.590> the<00:02:35.830> little<00:02:36.010> reminder<00:02:36.550> again<00:02:36.700> just

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.910 
in the little reminder again just

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:39.180 
in the little reminder again just
alleyway<00:02:37.420> time<00:02:37.720> and<00:02:38.440> i'll<00:02:38.560> put<00:02:38.740> this<00:02:38.890> one<00:02:39.070> in

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
alleyway time and i'll put this one in

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:42.960 
alleyway time and i'll put this one in
the<00:02:39.250> mesh<00:02:39.490> we<00:02:40.150> get<00:02:40.270> started<00:02:40.510> a<00:02:41.760> run<00:02:42.760> in<00:02:42.880> the

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
the mesh we get started a run in the

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:45.210 
the mesh we get started a run in the
ground
