about<00:00:16.350> five<00:00:16.830> years<00:00:17.039> old<00:00:17.369> I<00:00:17.760> picked<00:00:18.510> it<00:00:18.630> off

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
about five years old I picked it off

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.530 
computer would do so let's get right
down<00:00:30.060> into<00:00:30.420> the<00:00:30.510> hardware<00:00:32.090> well<00:00:33.090> on<00:00:33.300> this<00:00:33.480> side

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
down into the hardware well on this side

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.490 
down into the hardware well on this side

thing but hey let's get into the

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.390 
thing but hey let's get into the
software<00:02:32.910> well<00:02:33.629> before<00:02:34.110> that<00:02:34.140> I<00:02:34.860> would<00:02:35.220> like

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
software well before that I would like

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.339 
software well before that I would like
to<00:02:35.519> show<00:02:35.730> you<00:02:35.760> a<00:02:36.269> little<00:02:36.660> handy<00:02:37.140> thing<00:02:37.319> to

to show you a little handy thing to

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:40.070 
to show you a little handy thing to
replace<00:02:37.799> the<00:02:38.010> RAM<00:02:38.190> in<00:02:38.370> this<00:02:38.549> thing<00:02:38.760> so<00:02:39.090> do<00:02:39.870> that

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
replace the RAM in this thing so do that

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.430 
replace the RAM in this thing so do that
you<00:02:40.260> just<00:02:40.440> pop<00:02:40.739> these<00:02:40.980> two<00:02:41.220> tabs<00:02:41.519> up<00:02:42.440> the

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
you just pop these two tabs up the

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:48.140 
you just pop these two tabs up the
keyboard<00:02:43.700> it<00:02:44.780> pops<00:02:45.780> out<00:02:46.190> like<00:02:47.190> so<00:02:47.489> really

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
keyboard it pops out like so really

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.670 
keyboard it pops out like so really
revealing<00:02:48.720> your<00:02:49.200> RAM<00:02:49.549> your<00:02:50.549> hard<00:02:50.790> drive<00:02:51.030> and

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 
revealing your RAM your hard drive and

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.780 
revealing your RAM your hard drive and
Airport<00:02:52.680> Wireless<00:02:53.099> might<00:02:53.340> be<00:02:53.489> in<00:02:53.610> here

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
Airport Wireless might be in here

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:54.819 
Airport Wireless might be in here
somewhere

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:54.829 
somewhere

00:02:54.829 --> 00:02:58.630 
somewhere
yeah<00:02:55.829> it's<00:02:56.519> pretty<00:02:56.760> pretty<00:02:57.450> clever<00:02:57.690> I<00:02:57.870> think

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 
yeah it's pretty pretty clever I think

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:01.069 
yeah it's pretty pretty clever I think
it<00:02:59.640> kind<00:02:59.910> of<00:03:00.000> makes<00:03:00.180> the<00:03:00.269> keyboard<00:03:00.750> a<00:03:00.810> little

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:01.079 
it kind of makes the keyboard a little

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:03.619 
it kind of makes the keyboard a little
floppy<00:03:01.560> when<00:03:01.950> typing<00:03:02.430> like<00:03:02.940> you<00:03:03.209> could<00:03:03.390> push

00:03:03.619 --> 00:03:03.629 
floppy when typing like you could push

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:08.470 
floppy when typing like you could push
it<00:03:03.840> down<00:03:05.209> but<00:03:06.209> hey<00:03:06.599> I<00:03:06.900> really<00:03:07.709> don't<00:03:07.980> notice<00:03:08.129> it

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 
it down but hey I really don't notice it

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:13.150 
it down but hey I really don't notice it
so<00:03:09.480> let's<00:03:09.690> give<00:03:09.900> this<00:03:10.079> baby<00:03:10.260> some<00:03:10.590> power

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:13.160 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:16.789 

hanging<00:03:14.160> the<00:03:14.220> little<00:03:14.400> thing<00:03:14.640> with<00:03:15.030> the<00:03:15.799> with

00:03:16.789 --> 00:03:16.799 
hanging the little thing with the with

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:19.819 
hanging the little thing with the with
your<00:03:17.010> power<00:03:17.250> port<00:03:17.720> the<00:03:18.720> light<00:03:18.959> that<00:03:19.470> lights<00:03:19.650> up

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:19.829 
your power port the light that lights up

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:21.650 
your power port the light that lights up
to<00:03:19.980> tell<00:03:20.160> you<00:03:20.310> it's<00:03:20.489> on<00:03:20.670> is<00:03:20.970> not<00:03:21.239> on<00:03:21.480> the

00:04:28.189 --> 00:04:28.199 
palpable with that anymore I don't

00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:31.219 
palpable with that anymore I don't
really<00:04:28.560> think<00:04:28.650> ever<00:04:29.069> was<00:04:29.449> and<00:04:30.449> by<00:04:30.930> the<00:04:30.990> way

this<00:04:31.710> is<00:04:31.889> my<00:04:32.039> first<00:04:32.069> MEC<00:04:32.909> I<00:04:33.409> had<00:04:34.409> experience

00:04:35.029 --> 00:04:35.039 
this is my first MEC I had experience

00:04:35.039 --> 00:04:37.279 
this is my first MEC I had experience
with<00:04:35.159> Max<00:04:35.400> and<00:04:35.639> Best<00:04:35.819> Buy<00:04:35.909> and<00:04:36.300> things<00:04:36.569> messing

00:04:37.279 --> 00:04:37.289 
with Max and Best Buy and things messing

00:04:37.289 --> 00:04:39.350 
with Max and Best Buy and things messing
around<00:04:37.409> with<00:04:37.650> him<00:04:37.770> but<00:04:37.979> overall<00:04:38.729> this<00:04:39.030> is<00:04:39.090> my

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:39.360 
around with him but overall this is my

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:46.670 
around with him but overall this is my
first<00:04:41.599> Max<00:04:42.599> I<00:04:42.930> actually<00:04:43.289> owned<00:04:44.629> and<00:04:45.629> I<00:04:46.229> got<00:04:46.470> to

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:46.680 
first Max I actually owned and I got to

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:49.279 
first Max I actually owned and I got to
say<00:04:46.889> I<00:04:46.919> kind<00:04:47.159> of<00:04:47.460> like<00:04:47.699> the<00:04:47.879> different<00:04:48.509> OS<00:04:48.840> it's

00:04:49.279 --> 00:04:49.289 
say I kind of like the different OS it's

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:52.309 
say I kind of like the different OS it's
just<00:04:49.560> the<00:04:49.680> change<00:04:49.710> sometimes<00:04:50.580> I<00:04:51.110> mean<00:04:52.110> like

00:04:52.309 --> 00:04:52.319 
just the change sometimes I mean like

00:04:52.319 --> 00:04:53.899 
just the change sometimes I mean like
it's<00:04:52.740> nothing<00:04:53.159> compared<00:04:53.490> to<00:04:53.520> my<00:04:53.669> newer

00:04:53.899 --> 00:04:53.909 
it's nothing compared to my newer

00:04:53.909 --> 00:04:57.529 
it's nothing compared to my newer
computers<00:04:54.539> like<00:04:54.810> the<00:04:54.960> netbook<00:04:55.349> but<00:04:56.150> ok<00:04:57.150> it's

00:04:57.529 --> 00:04:57.539 
computers like the netbook but ok it's

00:04:57.539 --> 00:04:59.390
