00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
like to mention the this saddle bag that

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.720 
like to mention the this saddle bag that
I've<00:00:51.090> got<00:00:51.300> here<00:00:51.480> I<00:00:51.719> reckon<00:00:52.530> this<00:00:53.280> is<00:00:53.309> the<00:00:53.550> best

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.500 
I've got here I reckon this is the best
one<00:00:53.969> that<00:00:54.239> I<00:00:54.360> tried<00:00:55.289> so<00:00:55.469> far<00:00:55.500> because<00:00:56.300> this<00:00:57.300> one

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
one that I tried so far because this one

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.750 
one that I tried so far because this one
doesn't<00:00:57.859> wobbles<00:00:58.859> around<00:00:59.190> doesn't<00:00:59.699> move

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
doesn't wobbles around doesn't move

doesn't wobbles around doesn't move
around<00:00:59.820> when<00:01:00.180> you're<00:01:00.329> right<00:01:00.539> whereas<00:01:01.170> the

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
around when you're right whereas the

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.799

other<00:01:01.350> ones<00:01:01.739> they<00:01:01.949> just<00:01:02.219> done<00:01:02.430> they<00:01:02.879> move<00:01:03.120> the

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
other ones they just done they move the
