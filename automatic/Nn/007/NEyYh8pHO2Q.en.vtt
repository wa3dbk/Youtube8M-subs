00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:10.849
 hello friends sure there are many times 

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:12.889
 asked what protein you should choose in 

00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:14.480
 function of our objectives well then 

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:16.219
 the video and it's worth that let's try 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:17.960
 clarify all these concepts for 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:19.970
 it is clear that the protein is a 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:21.439
 essential element when we perform a 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:23.300
 strength training whenever 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:24.560
 we are at this stage we need the 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.960
 triple protein from which we came 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.820
 previously ingesting this only with 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.650
 the diet is complicated to carry it out 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:32.300
 for that there are the so famous milkshakes 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:34.010
 of proteins because it beat proteins 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:36.470
 they give you just the protein that 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:38.930
 you also need that it is very easy to 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:41.750
 use and fast but what protein should we 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:43.460
 choose then - according to what you need 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.500
 if what you want is a protein for 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:47.600
 after training your protein is 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.640
 whey protein is a protein of 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.170
 fast assimilation and in the boats you will see 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.730
 that the word whale appears within 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.109
 the fast assimilation protein and in 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:56.570
 function of the objectives you have 

00:00:54.109 --> 00:00:58.070
 you will find two types of the most 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.199
 isolated for people who want 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:02.539
 define or remove body fat this 

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:04.699
 protein is usually come in the pot with 

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:05.660
 the word and just beats or did this what 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:07.760
 what it means is that it has had a 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:09.530
 filtering process much higher in what 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.540
 that it was possible to isolate the protein with 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:11.990
 his word says and leave aside the 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:14.000
 grease 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:15.740
 and the hydrates the carbohydrates carbon if 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.360
 on the contrary your goal to win 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:17.990
 muscle mass and you have no tendency to 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.820
 get fat 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:22.100
 you must mix a protein that comes 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:24.860
 with carbohydrate this goes 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.939
 bring much more energy and in turn you 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:27.860
 you are going to gain much more volume 

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:29.000
 easily if instead what 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.380
 wants is a protein for between of 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.030
 sleep because as you know by the 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:34.009
 night is when the muscle regenerates 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:35.659
 what will help us gain volume 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:36.470
 protein is casein this protein what 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:37.820
 what you are going to do is distribute the 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:39.530
 amino acids throughout the night and 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:41.119
 favoring that muscular reconstruction 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:43.220
 between the rapid assimilation protein 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:44.810
 and the slowest simulation age protein 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:46.190
 say between the eu and the casina we 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.140
 we assemble another type of protein 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:49.909
 more average assimilation in this case will be 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.770
 egg protein soy protein 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:53.630
 this protein would be recommended for 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.009
 take it to the best between meals are 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:57.289
 shorter hours is not all the time of 

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:59.149
 dream but something positive comes from 

00:01:57.289 --> 00:02:01.009
 these proteins is that they do not come from 

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:02.840
 badosa milk that are allergic to 

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:04.399
 lactose good friends I know that this is 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.929
 a subject that I would give to talk hours the 

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:08.060
 video is over here if you have any 

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:10.099
 doubt do not hesitate to write me to sport 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:12.770
 at my dotcom body store if it has 

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:14.870
 liked the video subscribe to the channel 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:18.220
 and my advice always trains hard 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:18.220
 feed yourself well and believe in yourself 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.240
 plus
