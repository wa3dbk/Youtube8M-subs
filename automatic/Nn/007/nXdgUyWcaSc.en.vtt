00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
the batteries and as far as how these

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.630 
the batteries and as far as how these
sharks<00:01:34.320> swim<00:01:34.619> you<00:01:35.130> see<00:01:35.250> these<00:01:35.340> two<00:01:35.520> little

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
sharks swim you see these two little

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.850 
sharks swim you see these two little
black<00:01:35.970> dots<00:01:36.240> on<00:01:36.420> the<00:01:36.540> side<00:01:36.689> of<00:01:36.750> the<00:01:36.930> shark<00:01:37.200> when

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
black dots on the side of the shark when

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.620 
black dots on the side of the shark when
you<00:01:37.950> eye<00:01:37.979> cover<00:01:38.369> those<00:01:38.520> up<00:01:38.610> with<00:01:38.759> my<00:01:38.850> hand<00:01:39.119> it

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
you eye cover those up with my hand it

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.420 
you eye cover those up with my hand it
activates<00:01:40.170> the<00:01:40.290> fans<00:01:40.530> so<00:01:40.740> something<00:01:41.220> about

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
activates the fans so something about

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:42.800 
activates the fans so something about
when<00:01:41.579> you<00:01:41.700> put<00:01:41.729> them<00:01:42.060> in<00:01:42.180> water<00:01:42.329> and<00:01:42.570> the<00:01:42.630> water

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
when you put them in water and the water

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:43.850 
when you put them in water and the water
touches<00:01:43.110> both<00:01:43.380> ends

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
touches both ends

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.740 
touches both ends
that's<00:01:44.130> what<00:01:44.280> activates<00:01:44.579> them<00:01:44.850> alright<00:01:45.600> but

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
that's what activates them alright but

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:46.880 
that's what activates them alright but
enough<00:01:45.960> of<00:01:46.049> me<00:01:46.110> talking<00:01:46.350> let's<00:01:46.590> go<00:01:46.649> ahead<00:01:46.710> and

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
enough of me talking let's go ahead and

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:47.990 
enough of me talking let's go ahead and
put<00:01:46.979> in<00:01:47.040> the<00:01:47.100> water<00:01:47.310> and<00:01:47.460> see<00:01:47.610> how<00:01:47.640> they<00:01:47.820> work

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
put in the water and see how they work

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.520 
put in the water and see how they work
now<00:01:48.210> I<00:01:48.479> think<00:01:48.840> by<00:01:48.960> the<00:01:49.020> way<00:01:49.079> that<00:01:49.200> only

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
now I think by the way that only

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.230 
now I think by the way that only
recommends<00:01:50.040> that<00:01:50.100> you<00:01:50.250> put<00:01:50.430> one<00:01:50.700> in<00:01:50.820> at<00:01:50.970> a<00:01:51.000> time

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
recommends that you put one in at a time

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.330 
recommends that you put one in at a time
because<00:01:51.479> I<00:01:51.810> want<00:01:52.560> to<00:01:52.619> put<00:01:52.890> two<00:01:53.040> of<00:01:53.189> them<00:01:53.250> in

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
because I want to put two of them in

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:54.800 
because I want to put two of them in
they<00:01:53.490> kept<00:01:53.729> finding<00:01:54.030> each<00:01:54.299> other<00:01:54.420> and<00:01:54.540> it<00:01:54.659> kept

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
they kept finding each other and it kept

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.289 
they kept finding each other and it kept
getting<00:01:54.960> stuck<00:01:55.259> together<00:01:55.409> by<00:01:56.100> magnets<00:01:56.670> not

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
getting stuck together by magnets not

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:58.730 
getting stuck together by magnets not
sure<00:01:57.540> that<00:01:57.659> only<00:01:57.840> recommends<00:01:58.320> one<00:01:58.409> at<00:01:58.530> a<00:01:58.560> time

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
sure that only recommends one at a time

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:59.140 
sure that only recommends one at a time
because<00:01:58.920> I

00:01:59.140 --> 00:01:59.150 
because I

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:00.850 
because I
see<00:01:59.330> where<00:01:59.480> I<00:01:59.510> said<00:01:59.780> that<00:01:59.810> well<00:02:00.530> as<00:02:00.650> you<00:02:00.770> can

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:00.860 
see where I said that well as you can

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.070 
see where I said that well as you can
see<00:02:01.040> I'm<00:02:01.970> gonna<00:02:02.090> put<00:02:02.300> two<00:02:02.450> in<00:02:02.630> and<00:02:02.840> every<00:02:02.960> so

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:03.080 
see I'm gonna put two in and every so

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:04.420 
see I'm gonna put two in and every so
often<00:02:03.260> they<00:02:03.410> find<00:02:03.710> each<00:02:03.800> other<00:02:03.950> and<00:02:04.040> get<00:02:04.190> stuck

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:04.430 
often they find each other and get stuck

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:06.640 
often they find each other and get stuck
it<00:02:05.330> doesn't<00:02:05.570> actually<00:02:05.660> make<00:02:05.900> that<00:02:06.080> warp<00:02:06.410> noise

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:06.650 
it doesn't actually make that warp noise

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:08.020 
it doesn't actually make that warp noise
by<00:02:06.800> the<00:02:06.830> way<00:02:07.010> I<00:02:07.220> would<00:02:07.430> just<00:02:07.550> add<00:02:07.760> special

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
by the way I would just add special

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:26.260 
by the way I would just add special
effects

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:26.270 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:32.840 

you

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:35.070 

now<00:02:33.850> keep<00:02:34.150> in<00:02:34.240> mind<00:02:34.270> this<00:02:34.540> company<00:02:34.900> has<00:02:35.050> a

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
now keep in mind this company has a

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.200 
now keep in mind this company has a
commercial<00:02:35.680> where<00:02:35.770> they<00:02:35.860> have<00:02:36.010> multiple<00:02:36.280> aqua

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:37.210 
commercial where they have multiple aqua

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:38.640 
commercial where they have multiple aqua
bots<00:02:37.390> in<00:02:37.540> the<00:02:37.630> fish<00:02:37.810> tank<00:02:37.840> at<00:02:38.170> once<00:02:38.380> and<00:02:38.560> they

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
bots in the fish tank at once and they

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:39.990 
bots in the fish tank at once and they
all<00:02:38.770> seem<00:02:39.010> to<00:02:39.040> be<00:02:39.160> working<00:02:39.370> together<00:02:39.580> fine

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
all seem to be working together fine

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.610 
all seem to be working together fine
without<00:02:40.180> sticking<00:02:40.510> together<00:02:40.690> it<00:02:41.260> only<00:02:41.380> shows

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
without sticking together it only shows

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.100 
without sticking together it only shows
a<00:02:41.650> few<00:02:41.920> second<00:02:42.670> clips<00:02:42.910> of<00:02:43.090> it<00:02:43.210> but<00:02:43.390> they<00:02:43.870> seem

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
a few second clips of it but they seem

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:45.690 
a few second clips of it but they seem
to<00:02:44.140> be<00:02:44.200> working<00:02:44.350> fine<00:02:44.680> so<00:02:45.220> that's<00:02:45.370> why<00:02:45.490> I<00:02:45.520> got

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
to be working fine so that's why I got

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.100 
to be working fine so that's why I got
that<00:02:45.760> idea<00:02:45.940> that<00:02:46.210> you<00:02:46.270> can<00:02:46.390> put<00:02:46.540> more<00:02:46.750> than<00:02:46.930> one

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110 
that idea that you can put more than one

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:49.320 
that idea that you can put more than one
in<00:02:47.230> at<00:02:47.380> a<00:02:47.440> time<00:02:47.620> but<00:02:48.250> when<00:02:48.340> you<00:02:48.400> put<00:02:48.610> one<00:02:48.640> in<00:02:48.820> it

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:49.330 
in at a time but when you put one in it

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:50.640 
in at a time but when you put one in it
works<00:02:49.510> perfectly<00:02:49.870> fine<00:02:50.110> as<00:02:50.320> you<00:02:50.410> can<00:02:50.530> see

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650 
works perfectly fine as you can see

00:02:50.650 --> 00:03:22.680 
works perfectly fine as you can see
right<00:02:50.770> here

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:25.470 

and<00:03:23.650> as<00:03:23.890> you<00:03:24.010> can<00:03:24.100> see<00:03:24.160> right<00:03:24.400> here<00:03:24.460> after<00:03:25.090> five

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 
and as you can see right here after five

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:31.380 
and as you can see right here after five
minutes<00:03:25.720> it<00:03:26.140> shuts<00:03:26.740> down<00:03:26.830> by<00:03:27.130> itself<00:03:30.390> doesn't

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:31.390 
minutes it shuts down by itself doesn't

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:33.510 
minutes it shuts down by itself doesn't
actually<00:03:31.540> make<00:03:31.810> that<00:03:31.960> warp<00:03:32.170> noise<00:03:32.350> at<00:03:33.340> this

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:33.520 
actually make that warp noise at this

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:34.620 
actually make that warp noise at this
point<00:03:33.730> you<00:03:33.790> probably<00:03:33.820> asking<00:03:34.240> himself<00:03:34.390> I

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:34.630 
point you probably asking himself I

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:35.940 
point you probably asking himself I
wonder<00:03:34.840> how<00:03:35.020> these<00:03:35.140> things<00:03:35.320> will<00:03:35.530> react<00:03:35.800> to

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:35.950 
wonder how these things will react to

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:36.630 
wonder how these things will react to
real<00:03:36.160> fish

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:36.640 
real fish

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:38.250 
real fish
well<00:03:37.000> I<00:03:37.240> just<00:03:37.510> so<00:03:37.570> happen<00:03:37.810> to<00:03:37.840> have<00:03:37.900> some<00:03:38.110> real

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 
well I just so happen to have some real

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:39.780 
well I just so happen to have some real
fish<00:03:38.470> right<00:03:38.770> next<00:03:39.040> to<00:03:39.130> where<00:03:39.220> I'm<00:03:39.310> filming<00:03:39.670> it

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:39.790 
fish right next to where I'm filming it

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:41.880 
fish right next to where I'm filming it
and<00:03:39.970> the<00:03:40.630> fish<00:03:40.810> were<00:03:40.990> staying<00:03:41.260> at<00:03:41.350> this<00:03:41.470> these

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:41.890 
and the fish were staying at this these

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:43.440 
and the fish were staying at this these
little<00:03:42.130> fish<00:03:42.400> the<00:03:42.610> whole<00:03:42.640> time

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:43.450 
little fish the whole time

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:46.020 
little fish the whole time
so<00:03:43.840> here's<00:03:44.830> look<00:03:45.070> here's<00:03:45.370> what<00:03:45.520> happened<00:03:45.850> and

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.030 
so here's look here's what happened and

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:47.340 
so here's look here's what happened and
I'm<00:03:46.510> sure<00:03:46.660> they<00:03:46.750> don't<00:03:46.810> recommend<00:03:47.170> you<00:03:47.230> doing

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:47.350 
I'm sure they don't recommend you doing

00:03:47.350 --> 00:05:29.869 
I'm sure they don't recommend you doing
this<00:03:47.500> by<00:03:47.650> the<00:03:47.710> way

00:05:29.869 --> 00:05:29.879 

00:05:29.879 --> 00:05:31.519 

so<00:05:30.419> that<00:05:30.719> has<00:05:30.869> been<00:05:30.899> a<00:05:31.050> review<00:05:31.349> and

00:05:31.519 --> 00:05:31.529 
so that has been a review and

00:05:31.529 --> 00:05:33.159 
so that has been a review and
demonstration<00:05:32.249> of<00:05:32.309> the<00:05:32.490> Hexbug<00:05:32.969> Aquabot
