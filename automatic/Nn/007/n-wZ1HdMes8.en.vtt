 very good girls very good guys 

00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:06.879
 we are all always a new news 

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:08.769
 you know that on video games 

00:00:06.879 --> 00:00:11.080
 has already spoken practically of everything and 

00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:14.110
 have done almost any study 

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:16.119
 but a compilation of all these 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:18.100
 studies has come to the conclusion of 

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:20.590
 that video games make us better 

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:23.199
 the video game fans 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:25.180
 we develop certain skills more 

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:26.949
 there that the rest of normal people 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:28.960
 It's worth some form of protection 

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:30.160
 play video games according to what 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.750
 seen in the image that is in the 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.640
 description the fans to the 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:36.910
 videogames we develop certain 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:39.670
 skills or certain skills 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:42.640
 we could say much more than the rest 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:45.579
 of people playing the console is good 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:47.289
 nothing is bad as long as it is played 

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:50.559
 with responsibility and respecting the 

00:00:47.289 --> 00:00:53.079
 study schedules and equating when 

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:54.550
 the game recommends it or when 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:57.820
 when that is worth doing 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:59.199
 stops to avoid so I can 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.539
 appear epilepsy that can 

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:03.339
 nauseating nausea etc from the 

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:05.770
 you have to respect the times of 

00:01:03.339 --> 00:01:07.869
 game we prepare the video games we 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:10.960
 prepare to make much more decisions 

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:14.049
 Fast video games improve our 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:17.229
 creativity and imagination improve the 

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:19.990
 eye hand coordination and improve also 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:22.750
 the ability to drive low 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:25.690
 fog conditions we also take 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:28.149
 decisions 25% faster since 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:30.700
 we develop the brain and we can 

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:34.090
 focus on even six things to the 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:36.430
 time without getting confused and they also give us 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:38.740
 the ability to develop 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:41.500
 solve problems in different 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:44.440
 situations and solve different 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.880
 problems in different situations like 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:49.690

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:54.729
 It's all as negative as they see it 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:57.369

00:01:54.729 --> 00:02:00.280

 I recommend always studying and then 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:26.709
 playing is the reward of studying how 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:28.180

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:30.670
