really<00:04:34.050> isolates<00:04:35.050> just<00:04:36.039> tricep<00:04:36.460> buried<00:04:36.729> okay

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:37.000 
really isolates just tricep buried okay

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.939 
really isolates just tricep buried okay
another<00:04:37.510> variation<00:04:37.840> of<00:04:38.139> doing<00:04:38.320> the<00:04:38.500> tricep
