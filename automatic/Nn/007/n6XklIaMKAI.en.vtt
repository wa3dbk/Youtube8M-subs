00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:17.869
 batista70phone friends with today 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:20.180
 we will start a new video cycle that 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:21.650
 we will call smart review what they are 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:23.930
 smart review 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:26.360
 let's say it's a kind of summary 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:28.210
 of the video review or we call the 

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:32.570
 review for those without time 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:35.989
 I will try to do them after a period of use 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:38.690
 quite let's say long and conclusive 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:40.910
 this will obviously be possible on 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:43.129
 terminals of my property or on 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:46.490
 terminals that will come anyway 

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:48.410
 left for a medium let's say 

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:50.329
 at least let's talk about a couple of weeks 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:53.660
 in this case we start with the smart 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:55.790
 view of the blackberry z 30 in these smart 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:57.649
 and review sorry for the preamble more or 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:59.930
 less long minutino just to explain 

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:03.050
 the various will not be listed 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:06.110
 technical features will not be made 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:09.399
 see the playful part the screen it 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:12.890
 you will see so it will be more than anything else 

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:14.600
 field review on the fact of mine 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:17.450
 considerations on my experience 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:19.460
 of use that I think may be useful 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:22.299
 and this recession should not 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:23.960
 go over 56 minutes a very thing 

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:25.940
 rapid 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:29.030
 ok let's start right here we have ours 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:31.909
 blackberry z 30 we go to unlock it le 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:35.420
 you know them very well then 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:36.140
 experience in these two months of 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.240
 use 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.670
 I must say that I had a great time 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:43.280
 everything works beautifully for mine 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:45.250
 I have a lateral lab that illustrates me 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:48.250
 all the various 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:51.580
 notifications is very convenient in the case 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:54.010
 I wanted to isolate some e-mails for example mi 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:55.840
 is interested in isolating the shop's emails 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:58.120
 I'm going to choose just this one for 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:00.310
 see all my shop emails 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:02.110
 or I can recall other things and 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:05.290
 this is something very comfortable for me 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:08.050
 since I work there as well as call us 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:09.880
 or with the smart phone smartphone 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:12.400
 other very reliable thing about this 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:14.050
 phone battery I never had 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.950
 problems getting to evening even when 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:18.820
 I used it for 4 5 hours and maybe I was 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:21.690
 without the notebook 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:23.830
 I needed to consult various things 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.690
 no problem at all 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:27.940
 many of you have asked me but apk 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:31.470
 how they turn turn to wonder ad 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:34.750
 example I have to open this is tapatalk 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:36.580
 as well as the excuses now it has opened to the side 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:40.840
 okay it doesn't matter we can put it 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:45.489
 so let's open it and it works like 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:47.410
 works up quietly on android e 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:50.380
 without any kind of problem you can 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:51.910
 write you can not write consult 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:54.100
 do not consult do what you want e 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:55.660
 when you go to close it practically 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:57.940
 follows 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:00.910
 let's say the philosophy of android callback 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:02.900
 as long as in the end it takes over, let's say 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:05.900
 the philosophy of 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:08.569
 blackberry the fact of having the apps ad 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:10.849
 example let's open an app 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:12.379
 owner I didn't make a mistake about it 

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:14.959
 big this was the last I had to 

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:18.829
 going to open we open what I know of 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:20.840
 example the images the closing of the 

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:23.689
 image comes this way and I go to 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:26.209
 very comfortable to be able to 

00:03:23.689 --> 00:03:28.459
 leave more applications open from 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:31.090
 browser point of view there is no 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:34.189
 kind of problem no kind of 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:35.510
 slowdown of problems of 

00:03:34.189 --> 00:03:36.680
 views 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:38.989
 we always have the possibility of 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:40.969
 view content in flash or not 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:43.310
 oh well now they are opening our blog 

00:03:40.969 --> 00:03:45.230
 no it is now opening it fortunately 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:48.250
 in mobile version anyway I have to say 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:50.989
 that also the user experience at the level 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:52.219
 browser is really very satisfying 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:54.909
 now don't pay attention because as usual 

00:03:52.219 --> 00:03:57.290
 here or more connected devices 

00:03:54.909 --> 00:03:59.989
 ok anyway you see that the experience 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:02.180
 usage is really very good also like 

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:04.939
 this fluidity then in mobile version e 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:06.650
 is really working at the 

00:04:04.939 --> 00:04:08.919
 big and then as usual the closing 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:11.890
 it happens in the usual way we say that it is a 

00:04:08.919 --> 00:04:14.080
 very smart terminal 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:16.630
 and easy to use and very immediate 

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:18.250
 very rapid updates continue to 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:19.810
 going out for the last league 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:23.110
 precisely allow the installation of 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:26.050
 apk in any case is still present 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:30.160
 the blackberry world we can 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:32.919
 really find different applications 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:34.720
 divided by game application categories 

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:36.460
 you are a game lover anyway 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:39.280
 are there are various types 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:39.700
 now also asphalt 8 has arrived 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:42.260
 what to say 

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:44.180
 there are several things it is not 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:46.490
 it is an operating system abandoned to itself 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:48.830
 same or many say to blackberry is 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:50.570
 failing is not true because it has tightened a 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:52.280
 agreement with fox pon so there is one 

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:55.820
 guarantee that it will have good productions 

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:58.310
 it's all the audio is great we have it 

00:04:55.820 --> 00:05:01.300
 already spoken we have already heard both in 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:05.090
 call that in speakerphone 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:08.360
 perhaps the flaw of this terminal is the 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:12.500
 fact that it is relatively heavy are 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:14.900
 170 grams built very well memory 

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:17.200
 expandable this is something that many 

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:19.790
 of you require and many of you 

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:22.370
 they claim from a cell phone is short 

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:24.050
 we say that to all the comforts the only one 

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:25.400
 what is the battery is not removable but 

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:28.400
 I assure you that it is the last of the problems 

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:31.040
 that could happen to you with this type 

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:33.050
 of terminal rarely or of the 

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:34.820
 appointments but keep in mind that I since 

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:36.830
 first day always installed leak not 

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:38.120
 I've never had an original rom either 

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:39.440
 as soon as I removed it from the box 

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:41.540
 configured I immediately put the leak 

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:43.310
 so imagine not dreaming what 

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:45.050
 means having an original rom for 

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:47.570
 which maybe some light meeting 

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:49.310
 it usually happens to me when I do the 

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:53.270
 select and maybe I want to delete 

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:56.360
 some example conversation this is 

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:58.550
 I want to remove it and it happens sometimes 

00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:00.560
 maybe I still have a moment but 

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:02.810
 this is nothing special 

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:04.670
 the only bugs I found even though 

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:06.830
 using a league 

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:09.140
 otherwise everything really works 

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:11.060
 to wonder and if you are people who 

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:13.910
 really calls a lot and makes use of it 

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:15.890
 disproportionate of the mobile phone there 

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:17.240
 I highly recommend the camera 

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:19.460
 camera and onesta series with a 

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:21.410
 take decent 8 megapixel photos 

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:23.600
 good fluidity and that in the videos there is no 

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:25.100
 wait for miracles do not expect to 

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:27.860
 have a camera and at the levels of 

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:30.830
 nokia lumia 1020 but we still have a 

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:32.870
 terminal really very very valid e 

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:34.940
 always in extension as you see we have 

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:37.820
 also the amazon appstore that works 

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:39.890
 perfectly downloaded and installed two 

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:41.120
 applications without any kind of 

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:42.410
 problem 

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:43.880
 let's say the only applications 

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:45.400
 android that still don't work are 

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:46.970
 those that require authorization 

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:48.460
 Google 

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:50.600
 here you can't install google 

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:52.730
 services play service how the hell? 

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:53.660
 calls for which eg applications 

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:55.130
 hangouts type 

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:57.890
 I need and in fact uses a 

00:06:55.130 --> 00:07:00.530
 according to android phone do not go but 

00:06:57.890 --> 00:07:02.600
 facebook twitter linkedin work 

00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:04.460
 all whatsapp then these are own 

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:06.470
 there's no need for blackberry world 

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:09.320
 install apks such as an apk 

00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:11.450
 this side because I really like it is 

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:13.310
 seismic, ok, but it always opens up 

00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:15.500
 side goes well does nothing 

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:17.750
 and it is however very very valid you see 

00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:19.340
 works quietly tapping on 

00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:22.370
 top 

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:23.840
 we reach the latest notifications then 

00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:25.520
 we saw intense because he is lying down 

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:29.240
 otherwise we would see it easily 

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:32.660
 in the portrait version, there is nothing for fun 

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:35.030
 to say we have seen it promoted to full 

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:36.650
 votes and with this concluded the first la 

00:07:35.030 --> 00:07:38.440
 my first smart and the view I hope you 

00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:40.940
 it was useful and I hope you have 

00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:45.370
 welcome with this concluded greeting from
