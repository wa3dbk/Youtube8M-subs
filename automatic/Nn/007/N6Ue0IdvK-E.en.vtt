00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:07.570 
although on the other hand if you have

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:09.780 
although on the other hand if you have
like<00:02:07.810> different<00:02:08.560> instruments<00:02:09.399> then<00:02:09.520> they<00:02:09.610> can

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:09.790 
like different instruments then they can

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:11.790 
like different instruments then they can
play<00:02:10.050> complement<00:02:11.050> each<00:02:11.110> other<00:02:11.350> right<00:02:11.530> like<00:02:11.709> if

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800 
play complement each other right like if

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.290 
play complement each other right like if
you<00:02:11.920> have<00:02:12.010> ensembles<00:02:12.610> like<00:02:12.760> three<00:02:13.030> drummers

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
you have ensembles like three drummers

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.270 
you have ensembles like three drummers
and<00:02:13.420> three<00:02:13.720> base<00:02:13.900> is<00:02:14.140> the<00:02:14.290> great<00:02:14.530> thing<00:02:14.560> what<00:02:15.070> I

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
and three base is the great thing what I

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.150 
and three base is the great thing what I
would<00:02:15.489> hate<00:02:15.700> for<00:02:16.090> a<00:02:16.420> drummer<00:02:16.989> it's<00:02:17.709> been<00:02:17.890> 3

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
would hate for a drummer it's been 3

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.820 
would hate for a drummer it's been 3
which<00:02:18.340> with<00:02:18.550> all<00:02:18.730> bases<00:02:19.380> as<00:02:20.380> soon<00:02:20.530> as<00:02:20.620> I<00:02:20.709> have

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830 
which with all bases as soon as I have

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:22.310 
which with all bases as soon as I have
another<00:02:21.130> instrument

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:22.320 
another instrument

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.300 
another instrument
instructor<00:02:23.320> that<00:02:23.410> I<00:02:23.500> have<00:02:23.620> to<00:02:23.740> hire<00:02:23.920> at<00:02:24.160> that

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
instructor that I have to hire at that

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:28.020 
instructor that I have to hire at that
time<00:02:24.570> that's<00:02:25.570> what<00:02:25.750> makes<00:02:25.930> it<00:02:26.020> different<00:02:27.030> but

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
time that's what makes it different but

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.390 
time that's what makes it different but
what<00:02:28.150> if<00:02:28.180> you<00:02:28.330> had<00:02:28.480> like<00:02:28.660> four<00:02:29.500> drummers<00:02:29.980> for

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
what if you had like four drummers for

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.500 
what if you had like four drummers for
basis<00:02:30.880> for<00:02:31.150> piano<00:02:31.450> players<00:02:31.780> for<00:02:32.700> horns<00:02:33.700> on<00:02:34.330> be

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
basis for piano players for horns on be

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:37.260 
basis for piano players for horns on be
perfect<00:02:34.930> if<00:02:35.080> I<00:02:35.230> had<00:02:35.610> right<00:02:36.610> right<00:02:36.640> right<00:02:36.850> it's

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:37.270 
perfect if I had right right right it's

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:39.000 
perfect if I had right right right it's
just<00:02:37.480> making<00:02:37.660> the<00:02:37.810> transition<00:02:38.170> right<00:02:38.500> because

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
just making the transition right because

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:40.050 
just making the transition right because
I'm<00:02:39.130> thinking<00:02:39.370> about<00:02:39.430> the<00:02:39.550> same<00:02:39.790> thing<00:02:39.850> with

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
I'm thinking about the same thing with

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:41.370 
I'm thinking about the same thing with
my<00:02:40.150> camp<00:02:40.390> trying<00:02:40.630> to<00:02:40.690> transition<00:02:41.050> so<00:02:41.350> that

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:41.380 
my camp trying to transition so that

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:43.590 
my camp trying to transition so that
rhythm<00:02:41.680> section<00:02:42.070> instruments<00:02:42.550> so<00:02:43.360> it's<00:02:43.510> like

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:43.600 
rhythm section instruments so it's like

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:45.450 
rhythm section instruments so it's like
because<00:02:44.140> if<00:02:44.290> it's<00:02:44.440> just<00:02:44.590> it's<00:02:44.860> just<00:02:44.920> a<00:02:45.130> violin

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:45.460 
because if it's just it's just a violin

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:47.580 
because if it's just it's just a violin
fest<00:02:45.730> it's<00:02:45.970> like<00:02:46.150> right<00:02:46.900> but<00:02:47.410> there's

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
fest it's like right but there's

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:49.770 
fest it's like right but there's
positives<00:02:48.070> and<00:02:48.190> negatives<00:02:48.430> of<00:02:48.910> both<00:02:49.210> oh<00:02:49.420> yeah

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
positives and negatives of both oh yeah

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:55.230 
positives and negatives of both oh yeah
I<00:02:49.930> usually<00:02:50.110> hire<00:02:50.890> in<00:02:51.480> others<00:02:52.710> oh<00:02:54.060> yeah<00:02:55.060> yeah
