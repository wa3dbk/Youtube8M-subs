season and I just wanted to share them
with<00:00:44.129> you<00:00:44.219> guys<00:00:44.460> because<00:00:44.670> I<00:00:44.879> figured<00:00:45.149> some

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
with you guys because I figured some

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.660 
with you guys because I figured some
people<00:00:45.780> would<00:00:46.350> get<00:00:46.530> some<00:00:46.770> use<00:00:46.980> out<00:00:47.160> of<00:00:47.340> a<00:00:47.399> video

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
people would get some use out of a video

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.690 
people would get some use out of a video
like<00:00:47.910> this<00:00:47.940> they<00:00:48.570> fit<00:00:48.870> me<00:00:49.110> and<00:00:49.440> so<00:00:49.890> if<00:00:50.250> they<00:00:50.489> fit

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
like this they fit me and so if they fit

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.069 
like this they fit me and so if they fit
me<00:00:50.730> then<00:00:51.210> they're<00:00:51.360> probably<00:00:51.660> going<00:00:51.840> to<00:00:51.899> fit

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
me then they're probably going to fit

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.540 
me then they're probably going to fit
you<00:00:52.230> because<00:00:52.559> I'm<00:00:52.710> at<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:52.920> very<00:00:53.219> low<00:00:53.520> end

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
you because I'm at the very low end

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.420 
you because I'm at the very low end
these<00:00:54.210> ones<00:00:54.539> were<00:00:54.809> actually<00:00:54.989> think<00:00:55.590> the<00:00:56.129> least

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
these ones were actually think the least

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.130 
these ones were actually think the least
expensive<00:00:57.059> even<00:00:57.300> though<00:00:57.420> ASOS<00:00:57.809> is<00:00:57.960> like<00:00:58.109> a

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
expensive even though ASOS is like a

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.709 
expensive even though ASOS is like a
really<00:00:58.410> good<00:00:58.500> brand<00:00:58.829> so<00:00:59.370> I<00:00:59.699> got<00:00:59.969> this<00:01:00.149> red<00:01:00.480> one

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
really good brand so I got this red one

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.520 
really good brand so I got this red one
which<00:01:01.079> has<00:01:01.850> these<00:01:02.850> ruffles<00:01:03.480> on<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:03.930> front<00:01:04.229> and

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
which has these ruffles on the front and

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.200 
which has these ruffles on the front and
then<00:01:05.070> it's<00:01:05.280> got<00:01:06.229> straps<00:01:07.280> here<00:01:08.280> and<00:01:08.490> it<00:01:09.180> just

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
then it's got straps here and it just

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:10.940 
then it's got straps here and it just
comes<00:01:09.750> around<00:01:10.020> like<00:01:10.140> that<00:01:10.290> it's<00:01:10.590> got<00:01:10.770> the

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
comes around like that it's got the

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.679 
comes around like that it's got the
underwire<00:01:11.460> so<00:01:11.850> it<00:01:11.970> looks<00:01:12.150> kind<00:01:12.360> of<00:01:12.479> like<00:01:12.540> a

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
underwire so it looks kind of like a

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:17.120 
underwire so it looks kind of like a
bandeau<00:01:13.409> bra<00:01:13.770> type<00:01:14.130> thing<00:01:14.490> um<00:01:14.930> so<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:16.650> ruffles

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
bandeau bra type thing um so the ruffles

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.980 
bandeau bra type thing um so the ruffles
