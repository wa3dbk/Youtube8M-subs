00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.080
 It's hard to say what the fight will be like. 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
 I'm ready to fight from a distance, to get into the clinch 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
 I'm ready to fight him in a telephone booth 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
 Where I have to go to do the work, is what I am prepared for and what I will do. 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
 I feel great, I've thought about this fight for a long time. 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
 since I was a full weight I wanted to fight Jon Jones and it's finally happening, 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.000
 it is comforting to know that all the hard work I put in will finally be rewarded on January 3 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
 Izzy (Martinez), will be here for the fight, I have Mike Winkeljohn for my kickboxing, 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
 Brandon Gibson for my boxing and Greg Jackson for all the jujitsu. 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
 All the coaching staff. 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
 They say that if it's not broken, do not fix it, 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
 nothing is broken in my camp. 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.000
 Everything will come to the scene 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.737
 but it will be about who has a better fight plan and who implements it better, 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
 I can not hurry and try to take Jon Jones down 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
 I have to accommodate him with my punches and kicks. 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.000
 and he has to do the same. 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
 If I were fighting I would only win any day, but it's not fight is MMA. 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
 So it will be about who uses your best strategy. 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.000
 I believe in my team, in my coaches, 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
 and I know that they will have me ready for this fight, 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.000
 that I will be the best I have been. 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
 I would love to be part of a Super Fight. 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
 but it has to be with the right athlete, 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
 against Caín (Velásquez), I think the world would die to see that fight. 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.000
 I've been wanting to challenge him for a while, 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
 Chris Weidman against me I think it would also be good for people. 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
 Anderson (Silva) I do not intend to fight him 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
 I love him, in fact I will try to train with him, 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
 The Super Fights are definitely in my future, 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.000
 -Do you think Velásquez would happen soon? 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000
 Caín Velásquez will be able to pass at one point, I have mentioned his name for years, 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
 it's not because of disrespect, I consider him a great Champion, a great fighter, 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.000
 and many people would be anxious to see us. 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
 - You imagine it in a great stadium, the Stadium of the Vaqueros perhaps or the City of Mexico? 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.000
 Mexico City, of course, you never know what can happen ...
