is<00:02:16.739> the<00:02:17.099> big<00:02:17.430> reason<00:02:17.790> why<00:02:17.819> some<00:02:18.540> surge

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
is the big reason why some surge

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.819 
is the big reason why some surge
protectors<00:02:19.439> have<00:02:20.159> not<00:02:21.000> just<00:02:21.829> electrical

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:22.829 
protectors have not just electrical

00:02:22.829 --> 00:02:24.979 
protectors have not just electrical
outlets<00:02:23.189> but<00:02:23.430> outlets<00:02:23.849> for<00:02:24.180> your<00:02:24.810> network

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:24.989

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
cases other connections as well so yeah

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.899 
cases other connections as well so yeah
you<00:02:31.019> still<00:02:31.319> need<00:02:31.530> a<00:02:31.560> surge<00:02:31.890> protector<00:02:31.920> surge

00:02:32.899 --> 00:02:32.909 
you still need a surge protector surge

00:04:34.629 --> 00:04:34.639 
power source if you will so you have

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:36.219 
power source if you will so you have
time<00:04:34.909> to<00:04:34.969> save<00:04:35.449> all<00:04:35.599> your<00:04:35.629> settings<00:04:35.960> and

00:04:36.219 --> 00:04:36.229 
time to save all your settings and

00:04:36.229 --> 00:04:37.390 
time to save all your settings and
everything<00:04:36.530> if<00:04:36.620> the<00:04:36.710> electricity<00:04:36.979> goes<00:04:37.249> out

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:37.400 
everything if the electricity goes out

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:38.920 
everything if the electricity goes out
so<00:04:37.610> you<00:04:37.819> don't<00:04:37.849> shut<00:04:38.449> the<00:04:38.599> computer<00:04:38.719> down

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:38.930 
so you don't shut the computer down

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:43.420 
so you don't shut the computer down
automatically<00:04:39.710> having<00:04:40.249> a<00:04:40.340> good<00:04:41.590> UPS<00:04:42.590> is<00:04:42.620> also

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:43.430 
automatically having a good UPS is also

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:45.429 
automatically having a good UPS is also
recommended<00:04:43.580> of<00:04:43.999> course<00:04:44.240> even<00:04:44.870> better<00:04:45.199> is

00:04:45.429 --> 00:04:45.439 
recommended of course even better is

00:04:45.439 --> 00:04:47.559 
recommended of course even better is
some<00:04:45.650> type<00:04:45.800> of<00:04:45.830> voltage<00:04:46.249> regulator<00:04:46.729> because

00:04:47.559 --> 00:04:47.569 
some type of voltage regulator because

00:04:47.569 --> 00:04:50.619 
some type of voltage regulator because
what's<00:04:47.930> most<00:04:48.349> dangerous<00:04:48.770> for<00:04:49.240> machinery<00:04:50.240> is

00:04:50.619 --> 00:04:50.629 
what's most dangerous for machinery is

00:04:50.629 --> 00:04:53.439 
what's most dangerous for machinery is
not<00:04:51.050> when<00:04:51.469> the<00:04:51.860> power<00:04:52.069> surges<00:04:52.759> when<00:04:52.969> it<00:04:53.060> spikes

00:04:53.439 --> 00:04:53.449 
not when the power surges when it spikes

00:04:53.449 --> 00:04:55.989 
not when the power surges when it spikes
it's<00:04:53.719> actually<00:04:54.050> when<00:04:54.169> it<00:04:54.259> dips<00:04:54.740> that<00:04:55.430> can<00:04:55.909> be

00:04:55.989 --> 00:04:55.999 
it's actually when it dips that can be

00:04:55.999 --> 00:04:57.850 
it's actually when it dips that can be
very<00:04:56.300> very<00:04:56.479> dangerous<00:04:56.599> for<00:04:57.139> electronic

00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:57.860 
very very dangerous for electronic

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:59.700 
very very dangerous for electronic
equipment<00:04:58.310> and<00:04:58.490> of<00:04:58.580> course<00:04:58.819> computers<00:04:59.509> are

you<00:05:00.710> no<00:05:00.860> no<00:05:01.279> no<00:05:01.759> exception<00:05:02.300> to<00:05:02.360> that<00:05:02.419> rule<00:05:02.689> so

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:03.560 
you no no no exception to that rule so

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:05.170 
you no no no exception to that rule so
having<00:05:03.800> a<00:05:04.129> UPS<00:05:04.580> with<00:05:04.819> some<00:05:05.000> type<00:05:05.150> of

having a UPS with some type of

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:07.809 
having a UPS with some type of
regulation<00:05:05.810> in<00:05:06.740> there<00:05:07.039> is<00:05:07.310> certainly

00:05:07.809 --> 00:05:07.819 
regulation in there is certainly

00:05:07.819 --> 00:05:09.100 
regulation in there is certainly
recommended<00:05:08.300> but<00:05:08.419> it's<00:05:08.539> not<00:05:08.689> exactly<00:05:09.020> cheap

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:09.110 
recommended but it's not exactly cheap

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:13.330 
recommended but it's not exactly cheap
so<00:05:09.680> you<00:05:10.340> know<00:05:10.509> way<00:05:11.509> your<00:05:11.719> costs<00:05:12.199> but<00:05:12.560> bottom

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:13.340 
so you know way your costs but bottom

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:15.029 
so you know way your costs but bottom
line<00:05:13.370> at<00:05:13.789> least<00:05:14.120> have<00:05:14.360> a<00:05:14.389> surge<00:05:14.659> protector

00:05:15.029 --> 00:05:15.039 
line at least have a surge protector

00:05:19.959 --> 00:05:19.969 
probably break that rule more often than

00:05:19.969 --> 00:05:20.860 
probably break that rule more often than
not<00:05:20.029> of<00:05:20.270> course<00:05:20.449> if<00:05:20.539> you<00:05:20.629> don't<00:05:20.659> have<00:05:20.839> that
