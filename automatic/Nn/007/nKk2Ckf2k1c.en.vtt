00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.560 
and
I<00:00:34.500> think<00:00:34.980> the<00:00:35.070> secret<00:00:35.310> to<00:00:35.700> it<00:00:35.850> is<00:00:35.970> is<00:00:36.270> good

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
I think the secret to it is is good

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.130 
I think the secret to it is is good
quality<00:00:36.750> spring<00:00:37.260> I<00:00:38.600> had<00:00:39.600> these<00:00:39.780> Springs

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
quality spring I had these Springs

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.030 
quality spring I had these Springs
custom<00:00:40.590> made<00:00:40.770> by<00:00:40.980> EFS<00:00:41.550> and<00:00:42.440> also<00:00:43.440> got<00:00:43.739> a<00:00:43.770> shock

custom made by EFS and also got a shock

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.580 
custom made by EFS and also got a shock

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
absorber Third Point on the spring so

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.500 
absorber Third Point on the spring so
per<00:00:46.830> point<00:00:47.160> on<00:00:47.309> the<00:00:47.400> axle<00:00:47.730> where<00:00:47.879> each<00:00:48.000> tire<00:00:48.330> is

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
per point on the axle where each tire is

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.030 
per point on the axle where each tire is
there's<00:00:48.750> a<00:00:48.840> shock<00:00:49.080> absorber<00:00:49.530> now<00:00:49.830> they're<00:00:50.010> a

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:50.040 
there's a shock absorber now they're a

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:54.080 
there's a shock absorber now they're a
big<00:00:50.280> bore<00:00:50.690> 16<00:00:51.690> millimeter<00:00:52.170> sharp<00:00:53.090> gasps

shock<00:00:57.180> absorber<00:00:57.660> now<00:00:58.350> why<00:00:59.250> wouldn't<00:00:59.580> you<00:00:59.730> put

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
shock absorber now why wouldn't you put

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.869 
shock absorber now why wouldn't you put
a<00:00:59.970> shock<00:01:00.239> e<00:01:00.269> on<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.500> spring<00:01:01.800> you<00:01:02.640> wouldn't

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
a shock e on the spring you wouldn't

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.249 
a shock e on the spring you wouldn't
leave<00:01:02.970> the<00:01:03.150> shock<00:01:03.360> exhausted<00:01:03.809> car<00:01:04.019> we<00:01:04.229> just

00:01:04.249 --> 00:01:04.259 
leave the shock exhausted car we just

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:07.280 
leave the shock exhausted car we just
pull<00:01:05.190> your<00:01:05.309> pool<00:01:05.550> drive<00:01:05.910> now<00:01:06.509> you<00:01:06.570> can<00:01:06.869> do<00:01:07.080> this

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
pull your pool drive now you can do this

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.680 
pull your pool drive now you can do this
so<00:01:07.979> why<00:01:08.310> not<00:01:08.490> put<00:01:08.700> a<00:01:08.729> set<00:01:08.940> of<00:01:08.970> shock<00:01:09.210> absorbers

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:09.690 
so why not put a set of shock absorbers

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:11.810 
so why not put a set of shock absorbers
on<00:01:09.899> your<00:01:10.350> boat<00:01:10.530> trailer<00:01:10.740> your<00:01:11.280> car<00:01:11.490> trailer

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
on your boat trailer your car trailer

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.930 
on your boat trailer your car trailer
they<00:01:12.270> do<00:01:12.330> it<00:01:12.570> for<00:01:12.780> caravans<00:01:13.560> and<00:01:13.890> cam<00:01:14.430> patrols

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:14.940 
they do it for caravans and cam patrols

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:17.389 
they do it for caravans and cam patrols
why<00:01:15.060> not<00:01:15.240> the<00:01:15.330> boat<00:01:15.509> truck<00:01:15.800> see<00:01:16.800> this<00:01:16.950> one<00:01:17.130> over

00:01:17.389 --> 00:01:17.399 
why not the boat truck see this one over

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:19.639 
why not the boat truck see this one over
here<00:01:17.700> it's<00:01:18.119> copped<00:01:18.450> an<00:01:18.570> absolute<00:01:19.050> flogging<00:01:19.530> on

00:01:19.639 --> 00:01:19.649 
here it's copped an absolute flogging on

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:20.510 
here it's copped an absolute flogging on
the<00:01:19.770> leading<00:01:19.979> edge

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
the leading edge

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.760 
the leading edge
now<00:01:21.330> that<00:01:21.570> doesn't<00:01:21.960> actually<00:01:22.080> damage<00:01:22.740> the

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
now that doesn't actually damage the

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.310 
now that doesn't actually damage the
shock<00:01:23.100> absorber<00:01:23.520> because<00:01:23.850> they<00:01:24.119> are<00:01:24.360> double

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
shock absorber because they are double

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.020 
shock absorber because they are double
skinned<00:01:25.680> so<00:01:26.190> you<00:01:26.250> can<00:01:26.460> actually<00:01:26.610> get<00:01:26.880> the

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
skinned so you can actually get the

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.850 
skinned so you can actually get the
dents<00:01:27.300> on<00:01:27.420> the<00:01:27.539> outside<00:01:27.960> then<00:01:28.410> there<00:01:28.619> is<00:01:28.710> an

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
dents on the outside then there is an

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.910 
dents on the outside then there is an
inner<00:01:29.310> inner<00:01:30.300> tube<00:01:30.600> where<00:01:31.200> your<00:01:31.350> piston<00:01:31.710> runs

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
inner inner tube where your piston runs

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.529 
inner inner tube where your piston runs
up<00:01:32.130> and<00:01:32.250> down<00:01:32.340> in<00:01:32.640> so<00:01:32.789> there's<00:01:32.970> no<00:01:33.090> problem

00:01:33.529 --> 00:01:33.539 
up and down in so there's no problem

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:35.660 
up and down in so there's no problem
there<00:01:33.720> it<00:01:34.080> can<00:01:34.320> take<00:01:34.560> a<00:01:34.770> beating<00:01:35.280> with<00:01:35.550> the

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
there it can take a beating with the

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.999 
there it can take a beating with the
rocks<00:01:35.940> and<00:01:36.360> and<00:01:36.509> a<00:01:37.229> bit<00:01:37.380> of<00:01:37.500> rust<00:01:37.710> on<00:01:37.890> the

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
rocks and and a bit of rust on the

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.290 
rocks and and a bit of rust on the
outside<00:01:38.429> because<00:01:38.640> that's<00:01:38.910> what's<00:01:39.090> going<00:01:39.240> to

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:39.300 
outside because that's what's going to

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:44.389 
outside because that's what's going to
get<00:01:39.509> with<00:01:39.929> the<00:01:40.020> saltwater<00:01:41.090> but<00:01:42.090> look<00:01:43.399> here's

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
get with the saltwater but look here's

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.639 
get with the saltwater but look here's
the<00:01:44.550> proof<00:01:44.819> in<00:01:45.330> this<00:01:45.660> trailer<00:01:46.050> this<00:01:46.289> is<00:01:46.410> an
