00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:30.470 
it's not quite chrome but it's it's got

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:32.350 
it's not quite chrome but it's it's got
flats<00:03:30.739> it<00:03:30.980> up<00:03:31.190> saying<00:03:31.430> that<00:03:31.670> it's<00:03:31.970> very<00:03:32.150> good

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:32.360

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:59.259 
its got a door on so it's a flat finish
now<00:03:55.910> what<00:03:56.209> would<00:03:56.360> it<00:03:56.420> be<00:03:57.760> so<00:03:58.760> we<00:03:58.940> just<00:03:59.090> gave<00:03:59.209> out

00:03:59.259 --> 00:03:59.269 
now what would it be so we just gave out

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:02.199 
now what would it be so we just gave out
our<00:03:59.660> chrome<00:03:59.959> sprayer<00:04:00.290> try<00:04:00.530> and<00:04:00.769> a<00:04:01.340> mind<00:04:01.970> to<00:04:02.090> get

00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:02.209 
our chrome sprayer try and a mind to get

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:04.180 
our chrome sprayer try and a mind to get
the<00:04:02.269> very<00:04:02.540> pessimistic<00:04:02.690> call<00:04:03.260> very<00:04:03.769> excited

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:04.190 
the very pessimistic call very excited

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.870 
the very pessimistic call very excited
and<00:04:04.250> this

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:04.880 
and this

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:08.470 
and this
so<00:04:05.000> it<00:04:05.120> comes<00:04:05.210> out<00:04:05.860> extremely<00:04:06.860> well<00:04:07.250> it<00:04:08.060> covers

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:08.480 
so it comes out extremely well it covers

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:10.390 
so it comes out extremely well it covers
very<00:04:09.230> easy<00:04:09.380> and<00:04:09.530> this<00:04:09.650> is<00:04:09.770> just<00:04:09.830> a<00:04:09.950> Rob<00:04:10.130> job<00:04:10.310> the

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:10.400 
very easy and this is just a Rob job the

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.130 
very easy and this is just a Rob job the
car's<00:04:10.610> not<00:04:10.790> clean<00:04:11.120> it's<00:04:11.780> running<00:04:11.900> a<00:04:12.050> little

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:12.140 
car's not clean it's running a little

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:14.110 
car's not clean it's running a little
bit<00:04:12.380> but<00:04:12.560> which<00:04:13.160> is<00:04:13.250> a<00:04:13.280> couple<00:04:13.550> of<00:04:13.670> dabs<00:04:13.850> it

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:14.120 
bit but which is a couple of dabs it

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:16.770 
bit but which is a couple of dabs it
coloreds<00:04:14.630> absolutely<00:04:15.500> perfectly<00:04:16.250> and

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:16.780 
coloreds absolutely perfectly and

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:20.290 
coloreds absolutely perfectly and
quickly<00:04:17.780> and<00:04:18.020> it<00:04:18.560> gives<00:04:18.709> it<00:04:18.830> a<00:04:18.950> really<00:04:19.459> really

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:20.300 
quickly and it gives it a really really

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:23.320 
quickly and it gives it a really really
good<00:04:21.050> shine<00:04:21.320> now<00:04:22.040> what<00:04:22.520> Paul<00:04:22.730> suggested<00:04:23.180> is

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:23.330 
good shine now what Paul suggested is

that<00:04:23.450> if<00:04:23.630> we<00:04:23.660> cover<00:04:24.020> this<00:04:24.320> I<00:04:24.620> mean<00:04:25.220> call<00:04:25.370> it<00:04:25.400> an

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:25.550 
that if we cover this I mean call it an

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:27.850 
that if we cover this I mean call it an
area<00:04:25.850> with<00:04:26.330> this<00:04:26.480> by<00:04:26.780> to<00:04:26.840> drive<00:04:27.200> very<00:04:27.440> properly

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:27.860 
area with this by to drive very properly

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:30.490 
area with this by to drive very properly
and<00:04:28.160> then<00:04:28.430> lock<00:04:28.670> it<00:04:28.700> on<00:04:28.970> top<00:04:29.150> that<00:04:30.110> will<00:04:30.230> data

and then lock it on top that will data

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:31.960 
and then lock it on top that will data
be<00:04:30.590> even<00:04:30.800> brighter<00:04:30.950> so<00:04:31.250> although<00:04:31.610> it's<00:04:31.940> not
