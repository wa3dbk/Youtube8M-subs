00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
don't want to handle it so quickly I

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:13.070 
don't want to handle it so quickly I
would<00:00:12.090> say<00:00:12.300> first<00:00:12.509> thing<00:00:12.780> to<00:00:12.900> do<00:00:13.049> is

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
would say first thing to do is

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.599 
would say first thing to do is
disconnect<00:00:14.009> the<00:00:14.309> power<00:00:14.929> now<00:00:15.929> we<00:00:15.990> know<00:00:16.609> we're

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
disconnect the power now we know we're

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:23.000 
disconnect the power now we know we're
not<00:00:17.730> get<00:00:17.940> shocked<00:00:18.320> now<00:00:19.320> we<00:00:20.279> can<00:00:22.010> disassemble

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
not get shocked now we can disassemble

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:29.779 
not get shocked now we can disassemble
that<00:00:23.369> quickly<00:00:24.320> take<00:00:25.320> away<00:00:25.590> the<00:00:28.340> plug<00:00:29.340> that<00:00:29.519> had

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
that quickly take away the plug that had

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.910 
that quickly take away the plug that had
it<00:00:29.970> in<00:00:30.660> case<00:00:30.840> it<00:00:30.900> fell<00:00:31.199> off<00:00:31.260> it<00:00:31.650> would<00:00:31.740> hang

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
it in case it fell off it would hang

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.000 
it in case it fell off it would hang
onto<00:00:32.130> the<00:00:32.309> boat<00:00:33.050> you<00:00:34.050> a<00:00:34.079> couple<00:00:34.440> of<00:00:34.500> turns<00:00:34.770> of

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
onto the boat you a couple of turns of

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:49.160 
onto the boat you a couple of turns of
this<00:00:37.760> there<00:00:38.760> that<00:00:39.149> is<00:00:39.390> off<00:00:47.539> we<00:00:48.539> can<00:00:48.719> set<00:00:48.989> this

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
this there that is off we can set this

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:57.500 
this there that is off we can set this
here<00:00:53.870> and<00:00:54.870> as<00:00:55.379> far<00:00:55.620> as<00:00:55.680> the<00:00:56.250> board<00:00:56.820> system<00:00:57.390> it

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
here and as far as the board system it

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.130 
here and as far as the board system it
we're<00:00:57.660> sitting<00:00:58.020> on<00:00:58.879> it<00:00:59.879> should<00:01:00.420> be<00:01:00.600> just<00:01:00.629> as

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
we're sitting on it should be just as

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.289 
we're sitting on it should be just as
quick<00:01:02.149> velcro<00:01:03.149> straps<00:01:03.539> only<00:01:04.140> and<00:01:05.000> it<00:01:06.000> seemed

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
quick velcro straps only and it seemed

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.070 
quick velcro straps only and it seemed
to<00:01:06.360> hold<00:01:06.630> they<00:01:07.260> didn't<00:01:07.530> seem<00:01:07.680> to<00:01:07.799> go<00:01:07.920> anywhere

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:09.080 
to hold they didn't seem to go anywhere

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:14.350 
to hold they didn't seem to go anywhere
so<00:01:11.390> that<00:01:12.390> was<00:01:12.600> what<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:12.840> test<00:01:13.229> was<00:01:13.439> all<00:01:13.590> about

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:14.360 
so that was what the test was all about

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.260 
so that was what the test was all about
to<00:01:15.360> see<00:01:15.570> if<00:01:15.689> it<00:01:15.810> was<00:01:15.869> going<00:01:16.049> to<00:01:16.110> hold<00:01:16.290> on<00:01:17.240> so<00:01:18.240> I

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
to see if it was going to hold on so I

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.190 
to see if it was going to hold on so I
would<00:01:18.659> leave<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:18.990> velcro<00:01:19.200> here<00:01:20.720> just<00:01:21.720> so<00:01:21.990> when

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
would leave the velcro here just so when

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.140 
would leave the velcro here just so when
I<00:01:22.229> need<00:01:22.470> it<00:01:22.500> it's<00:01:22.890> not<00:01:23.189> somewhere<00:01:23.610> else<00:01:23.759> and

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
I need it it's not somewhere else and

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:32.980 
I need it it's not somewhere else and
this<00:01:24.390> just<00:01:24.960> lets<00:01:25.229> out<00:01:27.350> and<00:01:28.640> that<00:01:29.640> is<00:01:29.909> gone
