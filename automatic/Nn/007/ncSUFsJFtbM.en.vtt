itself you still got the little bump at
the<00:03:01.380> very<00:03:01.560> bottom<00:03:01.770> there<00:03:02.190> other<00:03:03.150> than<00:03:03.360> that

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
the very bottom there other than that

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.680 
the very bottom there other than that
the<00:03:03.960> contours<00:03:04.440> are<00:03:04.620> pretty<00:03:04.860> much<00:03:05.070> the<00:03:05.130> same

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:05.690

to spend a whole lot of time with it it
really<00:06:08.430> is<00:06:08.699> basically<00:06:09.330> a<00:06:09.510> vibrant<00:06:10.080> still<00:06:10.710> just

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:11.130 
really is basically a vibrant still just

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:15.740

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:15.750 
as light and easy to hold with this one

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:20.270 
as light and easy to hold with this one
here<00:06:16.199> I<00:06:17.720> like<00:06:18.720> the<00:06:18.930> 4<00:06:19.169> inch<00:06:19.199> screens<00:06:19.710> they're

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:20.280 
here I like the 4 inch screens they're

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:23.629 
here I like the 4 inch screens they're
by<00:06:20.820> far<00:06:20.850> my<00:06:21.570> favorite<00:06:21.900> size<00:06:22.310> just<00:06:23.310> because<00:06:23.550> you

00:06:23.629 --> 00:06:23.639 
by far my favorite size just because you

00:06:23.639 --> 00:06:25.040 
by far my favorite size just because you
go<00:06:23.729> a<00:06:23.760> little<00:06:23.910> bit<00:06:24.060> larger<00:06:24.270> and<00:06:24.600> just<00:06:24.870> feels

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:25.050 
go a little bit larger and just feels

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:28.460 
go a little bit larger and just feels
awkward<00:06:25.320> in<00:06:25.650> your<00:06:25.770> hand<00:06:25.979> typically<00:06:26.870> I<00:06:27.870> also

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:28.470 
awkward in your hand typically I also

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:31.520 
awkward in your hand typically I also
like<00:06:28.830> just<00:06:29.690> the<00:06:30.690> way<00:06:30.810> that<00:06:30.990> the<00:06:31.110> back<00:06:31.320> is

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:31.530 
like just the way that the back is

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:34.310 
like just the way that the back is
styled<00:06:31.919> I<00:06:32.130> think<00:06:32.820> it's<00:06:33.060> a<00:06:33.180> much<00:06:33.419> classier<00:06:33.720> look

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:34.320 
styled I think it's a much classier look

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:36.140 
styled I think it's a much classier look
than<00:06:34.680> the<00:06:34.889> vibrant<00:06:35.070> because<00:06:35.400> frankly<00:06:36.000> with

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:36.150 
than the vibrant because frankly with

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:38.330 
than the vibrant because frankly with
the<00:06:36.270> vibrant<00:06:36.690> that<00:06:37.199> thing<00:06:37.470> was<00:06:37.710> a<00:06:37.740> fingerprint

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:38.340 
the vibrant that thing was a fingerprint

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:40.640 
the vibrant that thing was a fingerprint
magnet<00:06:38.760> just<00:06:39.510> all<00:06:39.660> the<00:06:39.930> time<00:06:39.990> you<00:06:40.470> have

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:40.650 
magnet just all the time you have

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:41.960 
magnet just all the time you have
fingerprints<00:06:41.250> going<00:06:41.430> on<00:06:41.520> the<00:06:41.580> back<00:06:41.729> here

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:41.970 
fingerprints going on the back here

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:48.050 
fingerprints going on the back here
obviously<00:06:42.840> not<00:06:43.560> a<00:06:43.620> huge<00:06:43.949> issue<00:06:44.520> here<00:06:46.160> I<00:06:47.160> do

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:48.060 
obviously not a huge issue here I do

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:50.629 
obviously not a huge issue here I do
still<00:06:48.539> see<00:06:48.780> the<00:06:48.960> the<00:06:49.380> lack<00:06:49.560> of<00:06:49.590> LED<00:06:50.310> flash
