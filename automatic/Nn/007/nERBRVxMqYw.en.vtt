00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:10.080
 Hey guys, who thought it was not 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:13.710
 possible and it was a lie I did 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.849
 Look, I 'm only using one by one. 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:21.539
 fuel 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:24.660
 he enters oxygen does the mixing and enters 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.070
 on the system and the car is running 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:31.560
 perfectly 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:35.700
 care about our conversation not only looks 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:39.629
 I need cream just a few things 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:43.260
 some modifications is already perfect 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:47.850
 The coolest of all is that it's the 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:51.090
 next you can do three times as much 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:55.280
 for the footage with the same enthusiasm 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.280
 I'll show you guys out here in the corner. 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:13.040
 I do not know if it gives to realize there just looks 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:20.460
 just water and all that smell 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:24.150
 he has in the car not 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:29.729
 the smell of fuel and 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:33.869
 most interesting of all is that it separates 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:34.829
 water and alcohol in gasoline. 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:40.320
 happens 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:43.920
 thus becomes better burning and 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:47.460
 very dark planet but below 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:55.250
 it will separate gasoline from non- alcohol 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:55.250
 will have nothing of water together know 

00:01:56.329 --> 00:02:06.090
 other chemicals that have no solvent 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:08.039
 that damages the engine and 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.880
 That's when I'll call one more time. 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.989
 You see, I'll soon post a wine video. 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:15.150
 explaining how this is put together 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:18.470
 to be able the staff is saving there 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.470
 our right 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:28.860
 Look, he's just that easy. 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:31.470
 while gasoline was out 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.810
 it has a workaround right I'll do 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:36.030
 a more elaborate business a little bit 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:41.280
 better not 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:44.790
 I already do other types of installation, right? 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:48.330
 already the facilities as cells of 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:51.930
 hydrogen to prove to you a 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:03:01.790
 hydrogen cell is a cell of 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:03:07.560
 hydrogen a pwm el system but still 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:10.790
 I chose the best fuel only 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:17.070
 the steam was very functional and i 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:22.380
 I tried this is three times he does 

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:24.600
 three times the mileage with one 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:26.310
 even liter of gasoline burning directly 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:28.230
 in the system if the car is injected 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:30.870
 operation is much better this is a 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:33.960
 Injected carburetor shuts off all 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:39.060
 electronic system a pulp with little 

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:43.920
 battery improves engine wear not 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:49.460
 dries inside that neither the gas to CNG 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:49.460
 personal advantage until the next video there
