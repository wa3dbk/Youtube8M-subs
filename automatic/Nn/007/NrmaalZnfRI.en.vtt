 the smartphone lasted 6 half hours and 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:22.230
 here are his results next test 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:26.489

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:53.640
 hundredths the next test for lamps and here it is 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:56.720
 the result and finally check how much

 not equipped by the manufacturer 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:16.299
 productive processor and in 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:17.919
 I give a battery chip for 2000 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:19.930
 Milliampere hour is still too small for 

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:22.090
 continuous operation without 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:24.160

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:25.510
 the smartphone is very positive and it is without 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:29.460
