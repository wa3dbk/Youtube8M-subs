00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
too many cupcakes weight lifting will

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.420 
too many cupcakes weight lifting will
actually<00:00:48.809> help<00:00:48.930> most<00:00:49.289> women<00:00:49.620> lose<00:00:49.950> weight<00:00:50.219> and

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
actually help most women lose weight and

and legs and their waistline will

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.139 
and legs and their waistline will
actually<00:00:56.010> shrink<00:00:56.430> as<00:00:56.579> a<00:00:56.610> result<00:00:56.940> of<00:00:57.000> weight

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
actually shrink as a result of weight

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:58.279 
actually shrink as a result of weight
the<00:00:57.300> thing<00:00:57.420> if<00:00:57.510> they<00:00:57.629> don't<00:00:57.870> gain<00:00:58.050> any<00:00:58.260> weight

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
the thing if they don't gain any weight

the thing if they don't gain any weight
just<00:00:58.980> due<00:00:59.070> to<00:00:59.100> recomposition<00:00:59.670> and<00:01:00.090> muscle

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
just due to recomposition and muscle

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.270 
just due to recomposition and muscle
being<00:01:00.629> more<00:01:00.840> dense<00:01:01.109> than<00:01:01.230> fat<00:01:01.559> but<00:01:02.039> the

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
being more dense than fat but the

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.910 
being more dense than fat but the
overall<00:01:02.579> health<00:01:02.850> benefits<00:01:03.710> really<00:01:04.710> need<00:01:04.860> to

overall health benefits really need to

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:05.929 
overall health benefits really need to
be<00:01:05.010> addressed<00:01:05.220> because<00:01:05.460> a<00:01:05.580> lot<00:01:05.760> of<00:01:05.790> the

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
be addressed because a lot of the

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.969 
be addressed because a lot of the
problems<00:01:06.119> that<00:01:06.330> women<00:01:06.750> are<00:01:07.140> very<00:01:07.500> very<00:01:07.710> likely

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
to suffer from in many cases more so

to suffer from in many cases more so
than<00:01:09.780> men<00:01:10.110> can<00:01:10.590> be<00:01:10.710> exacerbated<00:01:11.640> by<00:01:11.790> not

than men can be exacerbated by not

than men can be exacerbated by not
lifting<00:01:12.450> weights<00:01:12.630> and<00:01:12.810> can<00:01:12.900> be<00:01:12.990> dramatically

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
lifting weights and can be dramatically

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.050 
lifting weights and can be dramatically

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
improved by lifting weights for example

improved by lifting weights for example
we<00:01:15.210> know<00:01:15.240> that<00:01:15.500> weight<00:01:16.500> lifting<00:01:16.950> can<00:01:17.250> hold<00:01:17.700> off

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880

we<00:01:35.460> know<00:01:35.610> that<00:01:35.640> people<00:01:35.880> who<00:01:36.030> lift<00:01:36.240> weights

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:36.860 
we know that people who lift weights

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:40.100 
we know that people who lift weights
regularly<00:01:37.860> at<00:01:38.100> least<00:01:38.310> two<00:01:38.610> times<00:01:38.820> a<00:01:39.030> week<00:01:39.110> get

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
regularly at least two times a week get

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.960 
regularly at least two times a week get
cancer<00:01:40.500> at<00:01:40.590> fifty<00:01:40.829> percent<00:01:41.189> lower<00:01:41.430> rates<00:01:41.790> in

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
cancer at fifty percent lower rates in

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.429 
cancer at fifty percent lower rates in
the<00:01:42.030> general<00:01:42.360> population<00:01:42.390> and<00:01:43.110> when<00:01:43.290> they<00:01:43.380> do

the general population and when they do

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.950 
the general population and when they do
get<00:01:43.680> cancer<00:01:44.130> their<00:01:44.490> survival<00:01:45.360> rate<00:01:45.540> is<00:01:45.720> twice

get cancer their survival rate is twice
as<00:01:46.020> high<00:01:46.380> so<00:01:46.860> that's<00:01:47.460> effectively<00:01:48.119> going<00:01:48.360> to

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
as high so that's effectively going to

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.630 
as high so that's effectively going to
give<00:01:48.540> you<00:01:48.630> a<00:01:48.659> 75<00:01:49.229> percent<00:01:49.710> higher<00:01:50.100> chance<00:01:50.520> of

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
give you a 75 percent higher chance of

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.270 
give you a 75 percent higher chance of
surviving<00:01:51.240> cancer<00:01:51.899> in<00:01:52.170> general<00:01:52.200> also<00:01:52.680> it

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
surviving cancer in general also it

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.399 
surviving cancer in general also it
reduces<00:01:53.460> diabetes<00:01:54.329> rates<00:01:54.600> by<00:01:54.780> up<00:01:54.869> to<00:01:54.930> sixty<00:01:55.320> to

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
reduces diabetes rates by up to sixty to

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.260 
reduces diabetes rates by up to sixty to
seventy<00:01:55.560> percent<00:01:55.920> and<00:01:56.430> it<00:01:56.790> improves<00:01:57.149> your

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
seventy percent and it improves your

seventy percent and it improves your

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
overall cardiovascular function so

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.550 
overall cardiovascular function so
you're<00:01:59.640> less<00:01:59.969> likely<00:02:00.000> to<00:02:00.570> have<00:02:00.990> issues

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
you're less likely to have issues

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.010 
you're less likely to have issues

of that nature overall everyone should
be<00:02:06.000> weight<00:02:06.210> looking<00:02:06.479> but<00:02:06.600> particularly<00:02:07.020> women

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
be weight looking but particularly women

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:08.749

for<00:02:07.890> those<00:02:08.009> reasons<00:02:08.190> and<00:02:08.520> it's<00:02:08.610> mainly

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
for those reasons and it's mainly

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.639 
for those reasons and it's mainly
because<00:02:09.000> they're<00:02:09.300> so<00:02:09.509> pushed<00:02:09.810> away<00:02:09.989> from<00:02:10.500> it

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
because they're so pushed away from it

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:11.950 
because they're so pushed away from it
socially<00:02:11.190> you<00:02:11.310> hit<00:02:11.430> something

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:11.960 
socially you hit something

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:13.750 
socially you hit something
to<00:02:11.990> be<00:02:12.080> pushed<00:02:12.350> more<00:02:12.560> and<00:02:12.770> more<00:02:12.950> so<00:02:13.490> you<00:02:13.550> have

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
to be pushed more and more so you have

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.250 
to be pushed more and more so you have
all<00:02:13.940> the<00:02:14.090> health<00:02:14.360> benefits<00:02:14.420> to<00:02:14.870> consider<00:02:15.200> for

all the health benefits to consider for

all the health benefits to consider for
women<00:02:15.650> and<00:02:15.710> then<00:02:15.830> you<00:02:15.920> have<00:02:16.130> other<00:02:16.400> factors<00:02:17.030> to
