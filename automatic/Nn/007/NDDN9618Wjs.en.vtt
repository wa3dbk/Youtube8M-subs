hey everybody Eric here from around to

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.220 
hey everybody Eric here from around to
at<00:00:11.280> RC<00:00:11.670> and<00:00:12.000> today<00:00:12.270> we're<00:00:12.420> out<00:00:12.510> the<00:00:12.630> Kleinfeld

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
at RC and today we're out the Kleinfeld

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.129 
at RC and today we're out the Kleinfeld
with<00:00:13.680> the<00:00:13.830> carbon<00:00:14.310> z<00:00:14.580> scimitar<00:00:15.480> that<00:00:16.049> we're

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
with the carbon z scimitar that we're

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:17.150 
with the carbon z scimitar that we're
going<00:00:16.320> to<00:00:16.379> give<00:00:16.470> it<00:00:16.590> a<00:00:16.650> quick<00:00:16.830> run-through

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
going to give it a quick run-through

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.040 
going to give it a quick run-through
here<00:00:17.640> while<00:00:17.820> we're<00:00:17.970> at<00:00:18.060> the<00:00:18.150> flying<00:00:18.390> field<00:00:18.480> the

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
here while we're at the flying field the

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.930 
here while we're at the flying field the
only<00:00:19.080> thing<00:00:19.410> I<00:00:19.530> did<00:00:19.740> to<00:00:19.950> it<00:00:20.070> is<00:00:20.250> I<00:00:20.430> added<00:00:20.760> the

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:20.940 
only thing I did to it is I added the

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:22.970 
only thing I did to it is I added the
electric<00:00:21.300> retracts<00:00:21.750> on<00:00:21.990> it<00:00:22.140> make<00:00:22.410> the<00:00:22.770> cool

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
electric retracts on it make the cool

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.590 
electric retracts on it make the cool
factor<00:00:23.369> go<00:00:23.490> up<00:00:23.670> on<00:00:23.820> it<00:00:23.850> just<00:00:24.000> a<00:00:24.240> little<00:00:24.480> bit

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
factor go up on it just a little bit

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.020 
factor go up on it just a little bit
more<00:00:24.810> better<00:00:25.500> than<00:00:25.710> that<00:00:25.920> it's<00:00:26.460> just<00:00:26.580> a<00:00:26.789> stock

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:27.030 
more better than that it's just a stock

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:29.029 
more better than that it's just a stock
airplane<00:00:27.449> on<00:00:27.600> the<00:00:27.660> stock<00:00:27.930> settings<00:00:28.350> so<00:00:28.830> let's

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
airplane on the stock settings so let's

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:30.710 
airplane on the stock settings so let's
take<00:00:29.279> it<00:00:29.430> up<00:00:29.520> in<00:00:29.670> the<00:00:29.760> air<00:00:29.910> and<00:00:30.420> give<00:00:30.600> it<00:00:30.690> a

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
take it up in the air and give it a

00:00:30.720 --> 00:01:04.070 
take it up in the air and give it a
quick<00:00:30.840> run-through<00:00:31.170> okay

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080

a<00:01:31.920> feel<00:01:32.130> for<00:01:32.340> the<00:01:32.429> plane<00:01:32.689> it's<00:01:33.689> actually<00:01:34.109> quite

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
a feel for the plane it's actually quite

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.109 
a feel for the plane it's actually quite
heavy<00:01:34.649> it<00:01:34.859> comes<00:01:35.100> in<00:01:35.280> at<00:01:35.399> almost<00:01:35.700> four<00:01:36.000> and<00:01:36.090> a

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
heavy it comes in at almost four and a

half pounds the stall speed on this

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.529 
half pounds the stall speed on this
airplane<00:01:42.959> is<00:01:43.170> actually<00:01:43.939> at<00:01:44.939> a<00:01:45.000> lot<00:01:45.270> higher

00:01:45.529 --> 00:01:45.539 
airplane is actually at a lot higher

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:49.669 
airplane is actually at a lot higher
speed<00:01:45.929> than<00:01:46.590> other<00:01:46.920> airplanes<00:01:47.610> like<00:01:48.569> I<00:01:49.049> can't

00:01:49.669 --> 00:01:49.679 
speed than other airplanes like I can't

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:50.899 
speed than other airplanes like I can't
really<00:01:49.799> compare<00:01:50.159> this<00:01:50.340> to<00:01:50.520> a<00:01:50.549> whole<00:01:50.700> lot<00:01:50.880> of

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
really compare this to a whole lot of

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.770 
really compare this to a whole lot of
different<00:01:51.270> airplanes

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:52.780 
different airplanes

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:56.150 
different airplanes
it's<00:01:53.350> kind<00:01:53.650> of<00:01:53.740> sick<00:01:53.950> like<00:01:54.220> a<00:01:54.460> striker<00:01:54.880> f27<00:01:55.840> -

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:56.160 
it's kind of sick like a striker f27 -

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:59.070 
it's kind of sick like a striker f27 -
but<00:01:57.160> the<00:01:57.280> flight<00:01:57.520> characteristics<00:01:57.970> are<00:01:58.600> just

00:01:59.070 --> 00:01:59.080 
but the flight characteristics are just

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.050 
but the flight characteristics are just
a<00:01:59.170> little<00:01:59.290> different<00:01:59.410> where<00:02:00.040> the<00:02:00.370> striker<00:02:00.700> can

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:01.060 
a little different where the striker can

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:06.690 
a little different where the striker can
come<00:02:01.270> in<00:02:01.590> and<00:02:02.590> a<00:02:02.740> very<00:02:03.010> low<00:02:03.370> airspeed<00:02:05.700> and

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:06.700 
come in and a very low airspeed and

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:08.160 
come in and a very low airspeed and
that's<00:02:06.910> about<00:02:07.120> as<00:02:07.300> low<00:02:07.510> as<00:02:07.630> I<00:02:07.720> can<00:02:07.750> go<00:02:07.930> with

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170 
that's about as low as I can go with

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:09.240 
that's about as low as I can go with
this<00:02:08.259> plane<00:02:08.500> right<00:02:08.530> here<00:02:08.740> that's<00:02:09.100> probably

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
this plane right here that's probably

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:13.920 
this plane right here that's probably
about<00:02:09.550> 45<00:02:12.120> just<00:02:13.120> because<00:02:13.420> we've<00:02:13.600> weighed<00:02:13.780> the

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
about 45 just because we've weighed the

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.730 
about 45 just because we've weighed the
airplane

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:17.740 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:24.100 

okay<00:02:21.459> alright<00:02:22.459> thrust-vectoring<00:02:22.819> zone<00:02:23.540> let's

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
okay alright thrust-vectoring zone let's

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:34.000 
okay alright thrust-vectoring zone let's
try<00:02:24.380> our<00:02:24.590> crazy<00:02:25.220> roll

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:38.199 

Wow<00:02:35.030> that<00:02:36.019> was<00:02:36.110> crazy<00:02:36.739> I'm<00:02:37.550> glad<00:02:37.790> I<00:02:37.819> was<00:02:38.060> up

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:38.209 
Wow that was crazy I'm glad I was up

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:45.059 
Wow that was crazy I'm glad I was up
high<00:02:38.360> too<00:02:40.360> and<00:02:41.360> that<00:02:41.540> was<00:02:41.690> on<00:02:41.810> low<00:02:42.019> rate

00:02:45.059 --> 00:02:45.069 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:55.760 

my<00:02:45.610> heart<00:02:45.849> going

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:55.770 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:57.680 

what<00:02:56.340> I<00:02:56.370> wouldn't<00:02:56.730> call<00:02:56.850> that<00:02:56.880> snapper<00:02:57.330> oh<00:02:57.480> how

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
what I wouldn't call that snapper oh how

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:33.360 
what I wouldn't call that snapper oh how
about<00:02:57.750> just<00:02:58.050> a<00:02:58.230> crazy<00:02:58.620> bro

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:33.370 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:04:01.619 

yeah

00:04:01.619 --> 00:04:01.629 

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:11.440 

so<00:04:02.109> hard<00:04:02.379> to<00:04:02.499> sing<00:04:02.680> back

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:11.450 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:14.350 

nice<00:04:12.440> now<00:04:13.370> you<00:04:13.459> can<00:04:13.610> see<00:04:13.760> it<00:04:13.849> takes<00:04:14.000> a<00:04:14.180> pretty

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:14.360 
nice now you can see it takes a pretty

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:19.449 
nice now you can see it takes a pretty
good<00:04:14.480> bit<00:04:14.810> of<00:04:15.430> runway<00:04:16.430> here<00:04:16.760> to<00:04:17.510> land<00:04:17.780> it<00:04:18.019> now<00:04:18.459> I

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:19.459 
good bit of runway here to land it now I

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:22.510 
good bit of runway here to land it now I
came<00:04:19.609> in<00:04:20.060> on<00:04:20.480> the<00:04:20.660> approach<00:04:21.340> probably<00:04:22.340> a<00:04:22.370> good

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:22.520 
came in on the approach probably a good

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:25.770 
came in on the approach probably a good
thousand<00:04:23.120> feet<00:04:23.300> back

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:25.780 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:27.570 

that's<00:04:26.380> because<00:04:26.650> of<00:04:26.800> the<00:04:26.890> flying<00:04:27.130> way<00:04:27.340> to<00:04:27.400> the
