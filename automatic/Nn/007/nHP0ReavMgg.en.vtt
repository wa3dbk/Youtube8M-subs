 I will not because I do not care about yourself and 

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:18.590
 because a poor doctor is dangerous for my 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:22.369
 health 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:24.350

 rally for the right of physicians and their patients 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:33.340
 probably this pattern is federal 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:34.460
 channels including trendy rain 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:37.010

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:49.820
 grows wild about how sweet it is to give up 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:50.450

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.829
 which sit Kremlin parasites 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:01.000
 too fat like patience 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:04.720
 of our historically frightened people 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:09.520
 hospital nurse 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:13.450
 you see that her salary is from 3900 68 rubles 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:16.820
 it means both that and that is added by dirty 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:19.850
 5000 749 rubles means on hand she 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:22.670
 I got a little bit more than 5 thousand and 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:25.660

 earned twenty seven thousand to 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:33.200
 dividing by 3 we can 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:35.479
 9000 it turns out yes we can salary and and 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:39.350
 find out the average is in which city 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:41.649

 a lot of this or not enough so to speak 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:43.610

 leave the profession quality all falls 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:31.090
 it is clear how to deal with it 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:32.860
 do you know firstly you need to do the first 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:36.430
 step it needs to declare the problem because 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:40.120
 that unfortunately unfortunately our days are all 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:42.070
 Our people know to date about without at 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:43.510
 position of medical professionals here 

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:44.950
 just recently approached me 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:48.430
 lieutenant colonel who oversees our 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:49.819
 an event with a question year you same 50,000 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:53.090
 earn 

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:56.239
 I ask a reasonable question where did you hear 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:59.180
 I said this on TV 

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:59.840
 let people not know and state the first step 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:01.370
 about the problem 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:03.739
 show what really is 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:04.999
 wages that do not exist lose 

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:06.950
 medium in the country 

00:04:04.999 --> 00:04:09.980
 Well, actually look later 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:13.370
 Ways to solve the fact that doctors pay little 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:16.190
 in the regions you know about it i myself it 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:19.070
 I passed in the course it just dwell 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:21.889
 such low wages it's just awful i 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:23.419
 do not even know what to compare and what you need 

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:24.949
 do in order to still 

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:26.460
 the government somehow reacted to 

00:04:24.949 --> 00:04:29.270
 this problem 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:29.270
 what should be done 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:32.670
 you know i can't even answer that 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:34.780
 simply 

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:37.420
 I do not know 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:39.340
 I donâ€™t even have some money 

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:42.100
 budget president basically big 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:44.290
 account decides for him too this 

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:46.470
 worth it and the signature where that 

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:49.150
 distribute he gives all our funds 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:50.650
 power structures, respectively, and 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:53.440
 what am I waiting for purposeful policy 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:55.150
 of our president of our state to me 

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:58.990
 very scary i am personally 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:05:01.240
 I have to have children in front of me for example 

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:03.520
 no big salary i don't know how i am 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:05.139
 I will generally support my parents 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:06.970
 when they will become elderly 

00:05:05.139 --> 00:05:08.430
 because all services are paid I do not remember 

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:10.540
 when I went to the hospital for free 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:14.680
 just because either a huge lineup 

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:16.810
 two months or no specialist and here 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:19.600
 Murthy the same problem there is such 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:21.640
 the problem is just acute but 

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:23.320
 there are opportunities I earn young 

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:25.270
 at least some money and what to do 

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:26.950
 older people i don't know which one 

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:29.830
 the service may be at the doctor if he 

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:32.470
 takes 20 25 patients how much he 

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:35.800
 can competently listen to the patient and 

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:38.530
 give him treatment and what to do 

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:41.060
 in order to still change something 

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:43.940
 this situation for the better 

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:46.810
 But I think you should go above this. 

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:49.460
 government depends on i think yes 

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:51.380
 tell about you for paid medicine or 

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:53.240
 still think that a person has 

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:55.190
 the right to free medicine in Russia 

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:56.960
 surely a person is entitled to 

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:59.120
 free medicine and why our 

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:01.220
 the government is still its social 

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:03.919
 some kind of commitment all the time 

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:06.260
 trying to pass on the population means 

00:06:03.919 --> 00:06:08.960
 it is beneficial to someone if people are 

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:11.480
 still afraid still silent 

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:13.700
 it will be a signal for power 

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:16.639
 further tighten the nuts further 

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:19.520
 degrade the social environment and in 

00:06:16.639 --> 00:06:21.680
 a certain point people will not 

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:24.830
 of choice they will be brought to the bestial 

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:26.690
 states and ultimately they will rise 

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:29.330
 before alternative or i still 

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:31.160
 I will be silent or I will rise because 

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:33.590
 I have nothing to lose in the regions 

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:37.490
 salaries are quite a trouble that is there started 

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:40.310
 beginner to lie 6000 experienced doctor 10,000 

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:42.650
 one and a half rates 15000 two bids 20,000 

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:44.210
 This is an average for regions in Moscow 

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:47.210
 get a situation but i have 

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:49.430
 Documents on hands that nurse 20:21 

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:52.250
 on hand with all payments 

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:53.390

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:56.270
 Moscow region 

00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:59.120
 one hundred and ninety two hours of work 8 night 

00:06:56.270 --> 00:07:02.539
 shifts for harm to the hands gets 32 

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:04.700
 thousand rubles in Moscow a little higher but 

00:07:02.539 --> 00:07:07.580
 very far from the official numbers 

00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:10.669
 Mrs. Skvortsova 67000 very far 

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:13.340
 the doctor has an average of 35-40 thousand in Moscow 

00:07:10.669 --> 00:07:15.950
 this is probably at all intensity with 

00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:17.990
 All payments in Moscow also lost in 

00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:24.980
 state salary 

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:27.200

00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:29.420
 for their rights in a gangster state 

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:32.680
 it is always dangerous sometimes even deadly 

00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:35.750
 dangerous but killing us is not bad medicine 

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:38.390
 good education and even good 

00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:42.140
 officials including a bad president 

00:07:38.390 --> 00:07:45.440
