00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:27.040 
deathmatch is by far the worst the worst
game<00:03:24.690> type<00:03:24.900> that<00:03:25.050> I've<00:03:25.110> seen<00:03:25.350> for<00:03:26.100> leveling

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:27.050 
game type that I've seen for leveling

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:29.150 
game type that I've seen for leveling
just<00:03:28.050> because<00:03:28.320> of<00:03:28.410> the<00:03:28.470> way<00:03:28.590> that<00:03:28.770> works<00:03:29.010> now

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
just because of the way that works now

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:30.440 
just because of the way that works now
you<00:03:29.190> get<00:03:29.520> a<00:03:29.550> hundred<00:03:29.730> points<00:03:30.060> for<00:03:30.090> a<00:03:30.240> kill<00:03:30.390> on

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
you get a hundred points for a kill on

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:32.690 
you get a hundred points for a kill on
TDM<00:03:30.840> whereas<00:03:31.740> in<00:03:31.920> Kill<00:03:32.130> Confirmed<00:03:32.160> now<00:03:32.640> you

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:32.700 
TDM whereas in Kill Confirmed now you

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:34.670 
TDM whereas in Kill Confirmed now you
get<00:03:32.940> 50<00:03:33.330> points<00:03:33.630> for<00:03:33.780> a<00:03:33.810> kill<00:03:34.110> in<00:03:34.410> Kill

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
get 50 points for a kill in Kill

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.140 
get 50 points for a kill in Kill
Confirmed<00:03:34.709> and<00:03:35.220> you<00:03:35.280> get<00:03:35.400> a<00:03:35.430> hundred<00:03:35.730> points

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
Confirmed and you get a hundred points

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:39.670 
Confirmed and you get a hundred points
for<00:03:36.209> the<00:03:36.390> confirm<00:03:36.810> so<00:03:37.110> it<00:03:37.200> gives<00:03:37.440> a<00:03:37.709> really<00:03:38.430> big

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:39.680 
for the confirm so it gives a really big

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:42.680 
for the confirm so it gives a really big
focus<00:03:40.680> on<00:03:41.070> actually<00:03:41.459> collecting<00:03:42.060> or<00:03:42.330> playing

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910 
the objective collecting the tax more

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:46.160 
the objective collecting the tax more
importance<00:03:45.360> than<00:03:45.540> actually<00:03:45.840> getting<00:03:45.959> the

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170
