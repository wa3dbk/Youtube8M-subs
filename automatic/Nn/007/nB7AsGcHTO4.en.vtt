with<00:00:31.619> a<00:00:31.650> shoe<00:00:31.949> that<00:00:32.880> had<00:00:33.059> eight<00:00:33.360> leaves<00:00:34.520> all

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
with a shoe that had eight leaves all

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.370 
with a shoe that had eight leaves all
the<00:00:35.579> shoots<00:00:36.030> came<00:00:36.360> from<00:00:36.480> the<00:00:36.570> same<00:00:36.750> plan<00:00:37.050> but

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
the shoots came from the same plan but

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.440 
the shoots came from the same plan but
the<00:00:38.129> topper<00:00:38.399> they<00:00:38.640> use<00:00:38.820> is<00:00:39.000> shown<00:00:39.239> in<00:00:39.390> the

leaf am rough water reservoir this may

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.729 
leaf am rough water reservoir this may
be<00:00:48.420> unusual<00:00:48.629> looking<00:00:49.140> from<00:00:49.350> never<00:00:49.469> seen

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
be unusual looking from never seen

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.150 
be unusual looking from never seen
before<00:00:49.950> I<00:00:50.870> could<00:00:51.870> put<00:00:52.020> you<00:00:52.170> with<00:00:52.410> a<00:00:52.530> bubble<00:00:52.949> and

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
before I could put you with a bubble and

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.450 
before I could put you with a bubble and
a<00:00:53.750> little<00:00:54.750> beaker<00:00:55.199> grass<00:00:55.800> peak<00:00:56.010> with<00:00:56.219> water

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
a little beaker grass peak with water

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.560 
a little beaker grass peak with water
like<00:00:57.300> a<00:00:57.329> pillar<00:00:57.690> to<00:00:57.960> submerged<00:00:59.300> okay<00:01:00.300> let's

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
like a pillar to submerged okay let's

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.410 
like a pillar to submerged okay let's
have<00:01:00.690> a<00:01:00.750> look<00:01:00.840> at<00:01:00.960> question<00:01:01.370> describe<00:01:02.370> how<00:01:02.910> the

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
have a look at question describe how the

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:04.820 
have a look at question describe how the
students<00:01:03.960> would<00:01:04.049> have<00:01:04.170> returned<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:04.589> air

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
students would have returned the air

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.609 
students would have returned the air
bubble<00:01:05.189> to<00:01:05.790> the<00:01:05.880> start<00:01:06.330> of<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:06.900> capuchins

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
bubble to the start of the capuchins

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:13.480 
bubble to the start of the capuchins
investigation<00:01:08.490> um<00:01:10.700> well<00:01:11.700> that's<00:01:12.360> why<00:01:12.780> this

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:13.490 
investigation um well that's why this

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.730 
investigation um well that's why this
part<00:01:14.490> diagram<00:01:14.909> looks<00:01:15.060> unusual<00:01:15.560> if<00:01:16.560> you've

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
part diagram looks unusual if you've

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.100 
part diagram looks unusual if you've
never<00:01:16.830> seen<00:01:17.070> before<00:01:17.220> all<00:01:17.880> you<00:01:18.210> have<00:01:18.390> to<00:01:18.630> do<00:01:18.780> is

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
never seen before all you have to do is

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:24.200 
never seen before all you have to do is
use<00:01:20.540> the<00:01:21.540> tap<00:01:22.189> what<00:01:23.189> that<00:01:23.400> will<00:01:23.549> do<00:01:23.729> is<00:01:23.759> it<00:01:24.150> will

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
use the tap what that will do is it will

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.840 
use the tap what that will do is it will
add<00:01:24.750> more<00:01:25.409> water<00:01:25.680> so<00:01:26.040> they<00:01:26.130> could<00:01:26.310> put<00:01:26.430> a<00:01:26.490> tube

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
add more water so they could put a tube

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.530 
add more water so they could put a tube
and<00:01:27.150> the<00:01:27.869> apparatus<00:01:28.229> pushing<00:01:29.100> the<00:01:30.000> air<00:01:30.270> bubble

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
and the apparatus pushing the air bubble

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.780 
and the apparatus pushing the air bubble
to<00:01:30.750> your<00:01:30.869> right<00:01:31.369> okay

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
to your right okay

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:39.050 
to your right okay
um<00:01:34.100> next<00:01:35.100> question<00:01:36.320> give<00:01:37.320> two<00:01:38.159> precautions<00:01:38.909> to

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
um next question give two precautions to

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.300 
um next question give two precautions to
the<00:01:39.960> students<00:01:40.350> should<00:01:40.530> have<00:01:40.799> taken<00:01:41.070> when

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
the students should have taken when

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.539 
the students should have taken when
saying<00:01:41.579> at<00:01:41.729> the<00:01:41.790> potometer<00:01:43.130> to<00:01:44.130> obtain

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
saying at the potometer to obtain

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:48.679 
saying at the potometer to obtain
reliable<00:01:45.119> measurements<00:01:46.280> of<00:01:47.280> water<00:01:47.549> uptake<00:01:47.820> by

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
reliable measurements of water uptake by

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:53.450 
reliable measurements of water uptake by
a<00:01:48.720> puncher<00:01:49.229> or<00:01:49.470> the<00:01:50.040> whole<00:01:50.220> horse<00:01:52.310> let's<00:01:53.310> go

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
a puncher or the whole horse let's go

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.080 
a puncher or the whole horse let's go
for<00:01:53.610> the<00:01:53.670> ease<00:01:53.909> one<00:01:55.610> if<00:01:56.610> you're<00:01:56.729> going<00:01:56.820> to<00:01:56.939> use

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
for the ease one if you're going to use

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:07.600 
for the ease one if you're going to use
the<00:01:57.270> tap<00:01:58.490> make<00:01:59.689> sure<00:02:00.920> the<00:02:01.920> tap<00:02:02.189> is<00:02:02.369> closed

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:07.610 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:10.580 

do<00:02:08.610> you<00:02:08.700> thing<00:02:09.050> wish<00:02:10.050> you've<00:02:10.229> got<00:02:10.320> a<00:02:10.350> leak

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
do you thing wish you've got a leak

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.810 
do you thing wish you've got a leak
anywhere<00:02:11.070> you're<00:02:11.790> going<00:02:11.940> to<00:02:12.000> lose<00:02:12.330> water<00:02:12.660> so

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:13.820 
anywhere you're going to lose water so

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:19.880 
anywhere you're going to lose water so
also<00:02:14.820> make<00:02:14.970> sure<00:02:15.180> it's<00:02:16.020> water<00:02:17.240> tight<00:02:18.890> you

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
also make sure it's water tight you

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.150 
also make sure it's water tight you
could<00:02:20.040> have<00:02:20.130> lots<00:02:20.340> of<00:02:20.520> others<00:02:20.820> web<00:02:21.150> and<00:02:22.160> you

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
could have lots of others web and you

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.230 
could have lots of others web and you
can<00:02:23.340> show<00:02:23.550> the<00:02:23.670> surface<00:02:24.030> of<00:02:24.120> a<00:02:24.180> leaves<00:02:24.480> a<00:02:24.750> dry<00:02:26.240> a

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:27.240 
can show the surface of a leaves a dry a

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:28.430 
can show the surface of a leaves a dry a
lot<00:02:27.990> of<00:02:28.110> them

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
lot of them

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.860 
lot of them
you<00:02:29.160> could<00:02:29.310> also<00:02:29.460> ensure<00:02:30.000> that<00:02:30.030> when<00:02:30.450> you<00:02:30.570> cut

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
you could also ensure that when you cut

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.610 
you could also ensure that when you cut
this<00:02:31.140> stem<00:02:31.800> it's<00:02:32.580> cut<00:02:33.000> underneath<00:02:33.540> water<00:02:33.900> so

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
this stem it's cut underneath water so

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.860 
this stem it's cut underneath water so
you<00:02:34.710> get<00:02:34.920> no<00:02:35.220> air<00:02:35.400> bubbles<00:02:35.730> trapped<00:02:36.570> inside

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
you get no air bubbles trapped inside

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:41.390 
you get no air bubbles trapped inside
and<00:02:38.570> reducing<00:02:39.570> your<00:02:39.660> water<00:02:39.870> loss<00:02:40.140> red<00:02:40.470> ok

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
and reducing your water loss red ok

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.140 
and reducing your water loss red ok
let's<00:02:41.970> see<00:02:42.120> how<00:02:42.240> this<00:02:42.450> recording<00:02:42.930> care
