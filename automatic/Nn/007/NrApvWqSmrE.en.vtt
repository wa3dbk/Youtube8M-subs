00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:16.009
 Vietnamese sandwich that drew our 

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:18.619
 Warning 

00:00:16.009 --> 00:00:20.330

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:26.420
 all major western cities 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:27.859
 his name banished it once was not it 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:28.699
 found that in the back shop of 

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:30.800
 chinese restaurants 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:32.720

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:44.930
 tell their friends it's cooking 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:45.610
 French through the baguette and 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:49.039
 the kitchen 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:51.020
 it reminds me of my childhood 

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:52.730
 and for good reason his recipe is eminently 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:55.910
 related to the history of colonization 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:57.379
 French at the end of the 19th century 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:57.920
 french squatted the south east 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:00:59.660
 Asian 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.340
 a wand under the arm in a few 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:03.109
 generations later around 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:06.410
 Vietnamese immigrants to import it into 

00:01:03.109 --> 00:01:07.369
 France with a mutant whose recipe 

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:09.500
 wrong but it's like sandwiches 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:12.210
 like but no we have added our 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:14.340
 ingredients to us 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.810
 the craziest thing in the ban is 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.729
 to have managed to mix the 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.229
 mayonnaise with lake tutoring and 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.270
 Camembert and honey chicken 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.890
 but do not imagine it's a vast 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.800
 anything there are rules to 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:29.310
 respect by the reality part of the vanni 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:31.220
 it is first of all a balance as in 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:36.000
 the vines and the yang of the five elements 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:39.030
 the bitter acid the cre the sweet the salty 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.649
 everything must be in balance today 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.570
 two generations compete against each other 

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:43.110
 supporters of the traditional bani and their 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.940
 progeny 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:48.270

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.780
 global Armenian side mail that I did 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:11.670
 it is still a bit derivative 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.950
 it 's not quite right like ang 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:16.200

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:40.730
 hot at least a mary mall son and 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:40.730
 christian hedgehogs bunnies you hear 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:46.680
 we eat we must feel the 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:51.030
 flavor of the plane and you have to have the 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:54.090
 account of the fauna and the acidulous of the 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:56.189
 carrot and after that is the tunes the 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:59.159
 fresh herbs lake having some ballet 

00:02:56.189 --> 00:03:00.950
 nuclear is good that it brings us a 

00:02:59.159 --> 00:03:02.989
 peach 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:05.930
 and to give one last touch to his 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:09.470
 enemy angela a secret inherited from his 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:12.560
 childhood in vietnam did with myself 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:16.220
 my own peppers and tokens refill to 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:17.709
 chili with sesame and I make a 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:22.400
 spicy sauce 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:25.880
 frankly it's the mouse 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:27.319
 traditional balmy direction 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:28.310
 now the restaurant of fred 

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:30.560
 he was born in France to parents 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:32.180
 vietnamese he grew up in belleville a 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:34.220
 Asian neighborhoods of Paris 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:35.989
 his dual culture allowed him to open 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:37.720
 one of the trendiest restaurants of the 

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:40.450
 capital city 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:42.910
 today 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:44.350
 always lived in paris what studies 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:46.210
 I wanted to do a concert you me 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:49.750
 look for start and are 

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:52.530
 today hypermodern deco here the 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:54.700
 artoyz have replaced the tips of the Chinese 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:56.980
 the idea was to get out the 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:59.200
 banned from a circle of insiders and the 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:59.530
 present to a much larger audience 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:00.850
 large 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:04.720
 a lot more public time in 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:07.120
 more so much more trendy and so for 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:08.710
 I chose a district a neighborhood 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:09.660
 which show the 10th arrondissement that there 

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:11.890
 where everything is happening right now 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:12.670
 result the first customers did not 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:14.200
 not wait 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:16.630
 we really adapted to a clientele 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:19.900
 rather feminine besides who wants 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:21.430
 of a clean o'shea concept with a 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:22.470
 healthy food and recipes change in 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:25.330
 according to the seasons 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:26.920
 but make no mistake if the decor and 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:27.670
 the customers are different from home 

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:29.560
 check madam 

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:31.720
 the recipe of the banished she is always the 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:33.760
 even guards and obviously the side 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:36.700
 traditional banished the best thing 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:39.100
 it can be said the other day it's 

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:41.470
 we find the taste of the 13th but in good 

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:44.050
 better and that we think 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:46.930
 it's a little cooler it's a little 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:48.880
 more balanced than the great knowing 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:50.140
 that it's fast enough to eat have 

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:52.060
 disputed five fruits and vegetables a day 

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:53.620
 so it's not bad compared to a 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:55.060
 sandwich that we can thing of which I am 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:57.970

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:59.470
 tasty meat to cook them time 

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:01.240
 it's not just food we put 

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:03.610

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:06.560
 sold there there is a kitchen behind 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:09.570

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:11.730
