00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:07.070
 and good guys and girls welcome to 

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:09.320
 my channel this time I want to show you a 

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:12.470
 thing and I'm disappointed with the 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:13.790
 ps plus ps 4 and in this video I'm going to 

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:15.440
 give my opinion but before you start 

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:17.270
 I have to say hello to some of my 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:20.869
 subscribers who asked me there 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:23.150
 Come on Mex Ewart Lluís Montañés Sergio 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:27.590
 pedraza and fabián gómez 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:29.510
 Greetings you are now if we start look 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:31.789
 I just want to tell you some things 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:34.010
 ok and that's when we had the ps3 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:37.030
 It's worth to play online with our 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:40.299
 Friends was totally free 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:43.219
 then the subject of the ps plus was optional 

00:00:40.299 --> 00:00:45.739
 come on, if you wanted to acquire the 

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:48.409
 games that gave in the ps plus because 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:50.479
 if you wanted to become a member you have 

00:00:48.409 --> 00:00:53.239
 happened in the new generation because in the 

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:56.719
 new generation the friends of sony us 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:59.359
 they force to be members of the ps plus for 

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:01.940
 play online with our colleagues worth 

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:03.559
 So the truth is that the idea does not 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.570
 like nothing because I started 3 was 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:07.909
 totally free to be able 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:12.800
 online since they force us to be members 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:16.610
 of the ps plus, but we think of ps3 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:20.150
 we go in the pce plus of ps3 the games 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:22.700
 Let's go they were great they were games 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:25.700
 triple to games that like in the 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:28.880
 market did not have a year or even 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:31.009
 less than a year that has passed then that 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:34.940
 yes that same policy that we had in 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:38.330
 ps3 with the pc plus we had it here in 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:40.520
 the pc plus pc 4 well, good if 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:42.979
 they force us to be members of pc plus 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:47.030
 but they give us great games but it is that here 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:49.250
 here in pc plus pc 4 is not like that we have 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:52.520
 lost quality friends and that's 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:55.820
 they only give us indies games look 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:02:00.410
 let's see the games that are in the 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:04.000
 pc plus of the month August for pc 4 we have 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:05.890
 the layered version of the drive craft 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.819
 in the scourge 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:12.760
 the limbo that is valid if in the layer version 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:13.870
 of dry craft and indie games are 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.280
 pretty good 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.959
 the truth is that the kropff wing is 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.720
 pretty good and the limo is a great game 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:21.850
 from my point of view but that the 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.730
 problem we have the members of the ps 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:28.690
 plus of ps 4 that only give us 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:32.330
 indies games is that I think that games 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:34.640
 like the killzone or 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:38.570
 what is this platform game called 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:41.210
 which came out better if it nac in which 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:43.850
 they are old games that I think 

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:47.630
 they should already be on pc plus pc 4 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:52.910
 but now we're going to compare the ps 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:55.430
 plus of ps 4 with the game which goal 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:58.220
 from the xbox one let's see what games 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:01.430
 they leave in September in the ps plus 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:05.000
 let's see guys the first is the 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:08.690
 tesla graph that I do not know we go indie game 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:11.330
 of course and I do not know what game is the 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:15.350
 second they give is the super time force 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:18.380
 ultra neither indie game that either 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:20.959
 I had heard him speak in my life and the 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:23.180
 third game they give is the great although 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:25.910
 is the most voted game of your game vote 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:27.680
 the animation of the ps plus that the truth 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:30.800
 is that game and neither have very good 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:33.290
 paints but as you can see they are all games 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:35.960
 without me is that they are all indie games and 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:40.310
 is that on top of friends the best of all 

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:43.310
 the month of September what the rate of 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:46.550
 one month and the three-month rate for the 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:49.610
 ps plus go up in price and then I 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:51.830
 I was thinking oysters now that it's going to rise 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:55.640
 price one month and three rates 

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:58.670
 months we will surely see better 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:01.580
 games no no no friends no better 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:03.080
 games do not go up in the ps plus but 

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:06.740
 the games are still the same 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:09.260
 indie games and that's what we're doing is that she 

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:11.000
 is that he explains to me by speaking seriously and is 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:13.550
 what I was going to say is worth the 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.410
 we compare with the game guys goal of the 

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:19.570
 xbox one that will come out in September 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:22.490
 which are the definitive tom raider edition 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:25.640
 that is good is a remaster but it is a 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:28.280
 juezo is a great game and it is not a game 

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:31.370
 indie but they give as a member of the game 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:34.880
 guys goal then the second game they give 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:36.920
 that of dirt got that the truth is that that 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:39.080
 game is a platform game but it is 

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:41.480
 an indie game but it's worth the combination 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:44.450
 it's good or you get a game 

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:47.420
 and a triple game 'a' that is what is 

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:52.280
 should do here in the ps plus of ps 

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:54.650
 4 we go I think I believe I then look at the 

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:56.720
 looks at the games that they gave look 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:59.780
 the game they gave in the game guys goal 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:02.600
 of the xbox one of the month of August that was 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:05.690
 the metal gear solid 5 bronze the other 

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:09.380
 I seriously play and it is that weigh plus 

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:12.350
 put on the batteries, gentlemen of son and put 

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:14.900
 the batteries stop raising prices that what 

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:18.320
 what you have to do is give good 

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:20.300
 games in the ps plus of the ps4 be 

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:23.660
 You will have to do the same thing that you do in 

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:25.730
 the pc ps3 and is that we have lost a 

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:28.490
 a lot of quality and I honestly is 

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:30.500
 that I am quite angry in earnest and 

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:34.010
 after that, for example, I pay the 

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:38.030
 The one year I do not know if they are 50 or 60 

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:40.490
 euros fuck that is money is worth and already 

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:42.710
 you have to do to take care of your 

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:45.830
 members of the ps plus and start 

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:48.440
