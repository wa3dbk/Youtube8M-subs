00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:08.150
 renault is the previous program remember that is how I recommended alex to do 

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:12.090
 a mouthwash to your pet before your pet already has symptoms 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:13.369
 efe 

00:00:13.369 --> 00:00:18.539
 accumulation of tartar there is a bit of gingivitis and that is why I see 'álex' 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.669
 he is very aware and wants to take care of his mouth perfectly 

00:00:21.669 --> 00:00:22.480
 animal 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.369
 went down today to subject them to an oral cleaning 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:29.480
 so that the system is exaggerating at all I'm going to show you how you could 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.530
 finish that mouth you have let fall within three years if we do nothing 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:36.140
 I have here with little ones done 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.190
 who really has the problem 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.330
 periodontitis with its gallant in its most extreme degree 

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:45.320
 among people beautiful people and holes in which has been seen how it has already 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.020
 lost many pieces 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:50.340
 portals that six pieces are missing 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.450
 that you are going to have to intervene later on the groups of 

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:54.730
 puppets mind 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:57.990
 not just a mouthwash if not already 

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:01.540
 extraction of several pieces will have to rebuild a little the holes that 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:04.250
 they are leaving a serious problem 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.570
 but there we have no problem with these because jan ter has a mouth almost 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:10.550
 perfect here what we are going to do is take away the focus san roque has 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:14.670
 continue giving you such advice so that you have something almost during all your 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:15.180
 lifetime 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.780
 when we go to the dentist we know perfectly well what 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.250
 the dentist is going to do us and we stoically endure the Indian women say that 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.320
 we are calm in the background we are logically nervous and we have some 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:28.660
 unpleasant sensations 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:31.660
 Of course, the dog has those same feelings 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:36.240
 but the dog does not understand what is happening here expresses anguish and therefore 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.030
 what we do is not a general anesthetic to the museum 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.909
 a sedation the dog is calm procedure towers 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:48.000
 be less stressful for both the dog and the professional who apply the 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
 pieces 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.240
 jojojo 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.100
 I was loaded with red devils 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:58.040
 c 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:01.040
 with us we are going a little 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:03.689
 our culture our risk 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.689
 it's being quite faster than expected 

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:10.519
 beyond that we can not wait 

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:12.879
 here you have your best friend 

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:14.429
 avoid percent 

00:02:14.429 --> 00:02:15.869
 I think he deserved the 

00:02:15.869 --> 00:02:20.299
 see how the teeth have now recovered their immaculate white appearance 

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:22.469
 that has disappeared this Saturday 

00:02:22.469 --> 00:02:25.229
 and now the best advice I can give you 

00:02:25.229 --> 00:02:29.909
 that I keep it for a very long time explain it brushes once each 

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:33.319
 two days you brush your teeth and do not use once a day 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:36.529
 a specific product to avoid tartar formation 

00:02:36.529 --> 00:02:39.469
 these products are going to help the mouth 

00:02:39.469 --> 00:02:44.199
 7 before then I do not need a mouth cleaning during these 3 4 with even more 

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:44.859
 years 

00:02:44.859 --> 00:02:47.670
 You have to be constant, I know that costs a little bit 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:48.879
 but deserved 

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:51.749
 very well costs with gusts and endless 

00:02:51.749 --> 00:02:56.019
 good friends cuéllar and ready our dog goes with the mouth to the implacable and 

00:02:56.019 --> 00:03:00.339
 that's very important because a healthy mouth is the same as having a dog pri 

00:03:00.909 --> 00:03:04.419
 and now I leave you with iñigo txikón he remembered to explore and remember that I 

00:03:04.419 --> 00:03:05.419
 I'll be back next week
