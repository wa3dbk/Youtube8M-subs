unit is in the right spot it just takes
a<00:03:13.680> couple<00:03:13.710> of<00:03:14.070> tries<00:03:14.340> and<00:03:14.670> it<00:03:14.700> takes<00:03:14.940> several

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:15.300 
a couple of tries and it takes several

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:17.660 
a couple of tries and it takes several

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
minutes just to get things in order but

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:21.020 
minutes just to get things in order but
once<00:03:17.880> you<00:03:18.060> do<00:03:18.210> it<00:03:18.530> stays<00:03:19.530> where<00:03:20.220> it<00:03:20.400> where<00:03:20.910> it

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030
