00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.320
 hello this is the first second we are on 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.150
 booth of asus at the exhibition 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.269
 computex 2014 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:18.090
 and in my hands asus memo pad 8 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:20.009
 This is an update of last year's tablet 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.320
 with this name just this year 

00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:24.119
 the company asus transferred it to the platform 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.580
 intel atom and the basis lies 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:29.390
 quad - core processor with a frequency of 2.5 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.390
 gigahertz 

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:34.110
 tablet itself 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.790
 significant changes bears it looks 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.480
 almost as it looked 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.790
 predecessor 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.979
 purely changed changed stuffing he 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.460
 began to work significantly faster un 

00:00:40.979 --> 00:00:47.129
 supports the connection of vayfay 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:49.170
 802 11 and 7 on the beyond high 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.760
 speeds there is naturally a modulus lt i 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.820
 also very fast 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:57.080
 glass protected by new gorilla glass 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:01:00.060
 glass 3 generation and also can be but taste 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:03.270
 new asus memo pad available 

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:05.070
 2 diagonals 8 and 7 inches but how 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.960
 it turned out the difference is not only in size 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.210
 the screen and tablets are pretty 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.610
 significantly in their characteristics from 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:15.710
 me in the hands of an 8-inch model she 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:18.930
 powered by intel atom z 3584 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:21.510
 three tenths of a gigahertz 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.880
 two gigabytes of ram and 16 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:25.560
 either 32 gigabytes of constant memory 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.690
 in addition there is a front camera 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.240
 on 1 and 2 tenths of megapixels 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:32.640
 there is a main camera with a resolution of 5 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.390
 megapixels screen certainly made 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:38.640
 on the ips-matrix and the resolution is 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:41.400
 1920 by 1200 dots autonomous time 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.170
 work is 9 hours true not 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.930
 specified by the mode 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.540
 most likely we are talking about the browser when 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.220
 Wi-Fi connection 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:52.200
 asus memo pad also feels 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.930
 configuration easier not about how 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:59.009
 7-inch model has a screen 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:01.440
 needs its resolution is 1280 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:03.060
 at 800 points here is also a bit simpler 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.610
 products with lower clock 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.720
 frequency 10 less memory operational 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.369
 just one gigabyte 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.080
 but oddly enough here stands 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.150
 front camera got with 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:15.210
 engaging 2 megapixels take it 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:17.580
 I will remind the models 1.3 me you prick 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:20.820
 it was the first point of the company booth 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:26.090
 asus at computex 2014 and 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:26.090
 asus memo pad 7 and 8 inch tablets
