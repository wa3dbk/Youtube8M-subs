00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.370
 they did and now we're going to the application 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:39.620
 had more information about the 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:41.750
 Enchantment positions in the envelope 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:44.000
 the tools and low now we're going to 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.920
 say what kind of enchantment 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.050
 each tool a failure option 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:50.239
 this is the range of visibility that 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:52.850
 now we are going to see also the craft 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:55.100
 eo of the apple of the golden apple ok 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.540
 reduction the amount ok now we are going to 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.190
 check all that here I leave it to you 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:59.720
 that you can see what it is that 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:01.580
 will be added and here below is what 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:04.879
 that was gone what was corrected in this 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:08.140
 new build as we can see then now 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:13.760
 there are no prices when opening the 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:15.490
 about the skillful good is the elyÃ³n that 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:17.290
 practically 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:19.000
 and everything else that the truth is that the 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:22.540
 other books I did not have them anymore 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.950
 neither things neither what not 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:25.119
 I understand is what it says up here in 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:27.490
 the top of the bar 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:29.170
 tools now all all space 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:31.030
 available neither more nor less I do not understand 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:33.070
 that but I still have several 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:34.420
 Now we're going to see all that 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:36.610
 we will open the application 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:38.289
 minecraft and how can we see then 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:40.840
 to be able to create new world I have one 

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:42.720
 here let me down a bit I have one 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:45.580
 created here where I'm going to show you 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.140
 practically all the new things that 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:48.850
 have been added in this new I'm going 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.920
 as we can see in the part of here 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:52.360
 down every time we press on a 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.740
 item that has for example a 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.569
 enchantment that he sells here doing in 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:58.840
 the sword that tells me that I have sharpness 

00:01:55.569 --> 00:02:01.690
 one and bursts and broke skill one if 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:05.409
 let's go here he says aquatic affinity 1 and 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:07.090
 what more than more enchantment book 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:08.799
 and here as we can see the peak of 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:11.799
 iron supposedly were arranged 

00:02:08.799 --> 00:02:14.380
 the prices at the time of opening added a 

00:02:11.799 --> 00:02:16.000
 animal even though the arrival was the crash 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.099
 jazz at the time of opening this so 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.440
 let's see if it's true there's see first 

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:22.959
 let's reduce the enchantments we're going to 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:25.540
 love a book let's see what is it 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:26.290
 that gives me power 1 ok let's love what 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.439
 for 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:32.829
 at once this is a small ship that 

00:02:29.439 --> 00:02:34.540
 We are not going to throw this book at you 

00:02:32.829 --> 00:02:37.150
 give for example things look and 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:38.650
 you press above the bar 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:40.180
 that's another book because 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:42.760
 could be considered if I want 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:44.620
 select for example a block of 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:47.200
 suddenly I put it is a bus that comes 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:48.700
 this version is somewhat uncomfortable to see what 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.659
 I just put and select the block 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:52.689
 see 

00:02:49.659 --> 00:02:54.730
 around here look good observe sometimes 

00:02:52.689 --> 00:02:57.450
 put a block ok let's go here and let's go 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:03:00.909
 to try the anvil table forgiveness 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:02.650
 let's put our sword the sword 

00:03:00.909 --> 00:03:04.810
 diamond that has two enchantments and 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:06.430
 let's put another enchantment this 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.620
 that we put, I can not put another 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:11.019
 spells good rays let's put 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:13.780
 this sword and let's put a 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:17.270
 enchantment that would be this one to 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:19.820
 see I can not do 

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:21.590
 which is the power one should put 

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:23.270
 to be able to put this enchantment good 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:27.050
 let me enchant another book to see what it is 

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:28.940
 what it gives me we are going to please no longer 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:30.680
 I have enchantments, that can not be 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:32.930
 well, I would need practically 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:34.970
 experience but what I see is that 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:37.940
 we can repair less things know by 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:39.470
 example let me try to break and good 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:42.020
 let me see if I can fix this 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:43.970
 sword is supposed to be diamond my 

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:46.430
 sword so with diamonds should 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:49.100
 to fix it will cost me 4 of 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:51.140
 experience so let's see and great 

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:53.210
 we could repair it and as we can see 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:54.200
 I remove my 4 levels of experience and 

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:56.720
 I just stayed with a level of 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:58.730
 experience so it's confirmed that 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:01.250
 the anvil is already fixed 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:03.560
 practically so this was one of 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:05.840
 the great changes that there was in istanbul 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:07.940
 that the anvil already serves what I did see 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:10.370
 since we can still change the 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:13.760
 name of the objects see him I love him 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:17.180
 change the name but but it does not let me 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:19.310
 to see wait let me see see 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:21.470
 my sword the sword to be and as 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:23.300
 we can see then I do not know if I need 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:24.860
 too much diamond the truth is that no 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:27.620
 I know I would need to change the 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:29.210
 name should be experience but 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:31.460
 Well, no, it does not, it does not change my name 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:33.110
 so I do not know, I think that also 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:35.990
 it's a book I also tried to do it 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:38.000
 when you repair but not either and what else 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:39.500
 that more than more to this option also 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.060
 the visibility range was added 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:43.490
 as we can see here says field of 

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:45.620
 vision we increase it and it looks like 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:48.289
 that a super weird but great effect 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:49.880
 at the same time so bus that I noticed from 

00:04:48.289 --> 00:04:52.130
 that we can not select yet in 

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:53.180
 this menu I'm pressing down on the 

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:55.699
 toolbar if I can not 

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:56.930
 change not only from before by 

00:04:55.699 --> 00:04:59.300
 example I want to put something here what 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:01.400
 select here and then select it 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:02.630
 from here but practically from here 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:04.220
 I can not change anymore see 

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:07.400
 pressing and I can not change so 

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:09.680
 that is a bug and as we can see then 

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:11.509
 practically see in it the field of 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:14.240
 view then now I can see a little more 

00:05:11.509 --> 00:05:16.130
 to my left there to my right and then 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:19.070
 you do not see anything wrong it looks pretty cool 

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:20.720
 and as we can see, I can do it 

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:21.720
 still like it says a little more than 

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:24.360
 zoom 

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:26.310
 it's great it looks super cool it would be 

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:29.400
 better that they will add a button to not 

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:30.900
 have to open for example the menu what 

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:32.460
 what am I talking about practically now 

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:34.320
 so I'm going to leave it here and then 

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:36.420
 practically that would be all the more 

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:38.520
 highlighted from this version many had 

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:40.830
 a book about craft create apples 

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:42.180
 golden ones which we can explain 

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:44.160
 right now because I do not have apples or 

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:45.690
 I have gold but supposedly I should 

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:47.670
 to be able to be kraft from here 

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:49.410
 golden apple so I hope that 

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:51.540
 if it works for others right now, 

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:53.700
 Well, I do not have gold and practically 

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:55.170
 it is nothing of much Now 

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:57.480
 they will be able to play from the table 

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:59.550
 and then it's practically what 

00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:00.810
 highlight of this version and well that 

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:02.970
 now we can see the kind of 

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:05.400
 enchantments that each object has 

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:06.690
 that here great and good with those of the 

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:08.100
 books that I wanted to show you as 

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:09.930
 can see I have two enchantments in 

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:11.600
 that sword so if it serves I did it but 

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:13.919
 I would have done it before I recorded 

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:15.900
 while you are recording so as thousand 

00:06:13.919 --> 00:06:17.460
 apologies as we can see then no longer 

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:19.650
 I can because I can not put anything because 

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:21.930
 practically already the enchantments book 

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:23.880
 power 1 as we can see you can no longer 

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:25.500
 singing would need another kind of 

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:26.400
 enchantment I think we are for the 

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:30.419
 swords like that 

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:32.310
 well, but I do not have a true anymore 

00:06:30.419 --> 00:06:33.900
 I have experience then something that I do not 

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:35.570
 I also know that when we try 

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:39.000
 love something here at the table 

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:40.889
 spells worth the redundancy then 

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.600
 nothing else takes away one of experience that 

00:06:40.889 --> 00:06:44.220
 I find it great but at the same time 

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:46.440
 because it would be a book practically 

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:48.539
 because if it costs you for example one of 

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:50.759
 five of experience then it comes to you 

00:06:48.539 --> 00:06:51.840
 costing only one here so good that 

00:06:50.759 --> 00:06:53.820
 It's true, I hope you liked it 

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:57.380
 that little review we see in the 

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:57.380
 next example see you later bye
