00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:09.650
 that I am going to present to the kids today 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:14.460
 a technique using cards 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:20.550
 in which a selected section is raised 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:21.869
 between 435 sorry then it is a technique that 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.050
 I was taught by a friend of mine 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:28.650
 just the other day I have never seen 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.859
 do in cartomagia maybe it's me who 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:34.380
 I've never seen such tricks but 

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:36.540
 on I know how to say anyway I go 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:40.320
 present her, you have nothing of that though 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:42.540
 I wanted let you all see him substance 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.640
 I show because I know some 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:48.750
 new techniques may be apparent 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:56.640
 if you don't like fights you put a card 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:01:01.289
 at the bottom a high on a bottom in 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:04.619
 high is completed at the bottom 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:10.080
 we have three cards that protrude from the bottom 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:17.610
 and two cards sticking over then you go 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:23.310
 to bring March together by beating on the side 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:28.409
 then triple gently two more 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:31.850
 go up for classical logic turns the 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:45.750
 deck and the card going up will be only one 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:50.399
 look at the technical ace of flowers 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:52.470
 really trivial but without these 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:55.110
 we say these techniques would not exist 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.329
 then more complex 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.610
 so I could say that anyway 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:01.320
 technique to know that you can suffer 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.009
 thanks for watching and commenting 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.009
 look at them bye
