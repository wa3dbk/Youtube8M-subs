00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:09.380 
kind of looks like a Mack but that's a

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:14.230 
kind of looks like a Mack but that's a
really<00:01:09.679> painted<00:01:10.429> metal<00:01:10.819> I<00:01:12.850> was<00:01:13.850> looking<00:01:14.119> at

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:14.240 
really painted metal I was looking at

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.300 
really painted metal I was looking at
mostly<00:01:14.749> before<00:01:15.229> I<00:01:15.259> open<00:01:16.039> the<00:01:16.159> package<00:01:16.999> and

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:18.310 
mostly before I open the package and

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:22.139 
mostly before I open the package and
hard<00:01:19.310> to<00:01:19.459> tell<00:01:19.759> now<00:01:20.060> now<00:01:20.689> I'm<00:01:20.840> questioning<00:01:21.139> my

00:01:22.139 --> 00:01:22.149 
hard to tell now now I'm questioning my

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:25.029 
hard to tell now now I'm questioning my
decision<00:01:23.149> whether<00:01:23.329> that's<00:01:23.659> as<00:01:23.929> a<00:01:24.289> mech<00:01:24.590> or<00:01:24.889> if

00:01:25.029 --> 00:01:25.039 
decision whether that's as a mech or if

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:28.059 
decision whether that's as a mech or if
it's<00:01:25.249> painted<00:01:25.880> metal<00:01:26.439> now<00:01:27.439> I'm<00:01:27.499> leaning<00:01:27.770> more

00:01:28.059 --> 00:01:28.069 
it's painted metal now I'm leaning more

00:01:28.069 --> 00:01:30.969 
it's painted metal now I'm leaning more
towards<00:01:28.549> it<00:01:28.670> being<00:01:28.909> just<00:01:28.969> a<00:01:29.649> metal<00:01:30.649> with<00:01:30.829> the

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:30.979 
towards it being just a metal with the

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:34.629 
towards it being just a metal with the
clear<00:01:31.310> coat<00:01:31.609> but<00:01:32.209> anyways<00:01:33.340> pretty<00:01:34.340> cool

00:01:34.629 --> 00:01:34.639 
clear coat but anyways pretty cool

00:01:34.639 --> 00:01:37.779 
clear coat but anyways pretty cool

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
that the winner of the drawing that they

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.269 
that the winner of the drawing that they
chose<00:01:59.450> and<00:02:00.439> you<00:02:00.529> know<00:02:00.619> the<00:02:00.739> model<00:02:00.950> would<00:02:01.219> be

00:02:01.269 --> 00:02:01.279 
chose and you know the model would be

00:02:01.279 --> 00:02:05.469 
chose and you know the model would be
taken<00:02:01.789> from<00:02:01.819> this<00:02:02.739> inspiration<00:02:04.239> now<00:02:05.239> I<00:02:05.270> have

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479 
taken from this inspiration now I have
