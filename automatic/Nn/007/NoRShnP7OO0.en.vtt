sent<00:01:22.590> into<00:01:22.710> cab<00:01:23.450> forward<00:01:24.450> and<00:01:27.350> you<00:01:28.350> can<00:01:28.380> see

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
sent into cab forward and you can see

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.330 
sent into cab forward and you can see
here<00:01:29.369> on<00:01:29.939> the<00:01:30.509> hood<00:01:30.810> I<00:01:30.840> had<00:01:31.320> some<00:01:31.530> spots<00:01:31.920> that<00:01:32.159> I

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
here on the hood I had some spots that I

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.690 
here on the hood I had some spots that I
knew<00:01:32.579> we're<00:01:33.479> not<00:01:33.630> going<00:01:33.780> to<00:01:33.810> be<00:01:33.960> right

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:34.700 
knew we're not going to be right

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.819 
knew we're not going to be right
so<00:01:35.700> I've<00:01:36.030> blocked<00:01:36.390> sanded<00:01:36.869> that<00:01:36.990> down<00:01:37.229> and<00:01:37.650> and

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
so I've blocked sanded that down and and

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.819 
so I've blocked sanded that down and and
did<00:01:38.250> a<00:01:38.280> little<00:01:38.490> more<00:01:38.640> work<00:01:38.820> to<00:01:39.060> it<00:01:39.180> and<00:01:39.829> it

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
did a little more work to it and it

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:44.440 
did a little more work to it and it
should<00:01:41.040> come<00:01:41.280> out<00:01:41.340> pretty<00:01:41.490> good<00:01:42.090> now<00:01:42.329> I<00:01:42.360> think

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450 
should come out pretty good now I think

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:49.310 
should come out pretty good now I think
so<00:01:45.450> we're<00:01:45.689> gonna<00:01:45.780> prime<00:01:46.200> that<00:01:46.820> today<00:01:48.320> along

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
so we're gonna prime that today along

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.789 
so we're gonna prime that today along
with<00:01:49.350> the<00:01:49.649> rear<00:01:49.920> of<00:01:50.130> the<00:01:50.399> bad<00:01:51.320> spot<00:01:52.320> prime<00:01:52.619> and

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
with the rear of the bad spot prime and

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.760 
with the rear of the bad spot prime and
I<00:01:52.829> guess<00:01:53.040> is<00:01:53.220> what<00:01:53.430> you<00:01:53.579> would<00:01:53.759> call<00:01:53.970> it<00:01:54.770> now

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770
