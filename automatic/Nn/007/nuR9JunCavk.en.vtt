00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.389
 good today I want to present you 

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:05.580
 an excellent application that I found the 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:07.080
 today that is called camera kit such and 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.019
 as you see there in the bottom 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.670
 I want to mention that this application 

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:14.250
 at the moment I'm recording this video 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.199
 is completely free the 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.170
 you can download directly from the app 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:21.420
 store 'you do not need jailbreak and you could 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.250
 be using it right now 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.410
 application is focused on those 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.019
 people who like to take many 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.029
 photographs on some occasions the 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.619
 application that is integrated for 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.230
 take pictures inside our phone 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.790
 iphone sometimes does not have all the 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.640
 functionality that we would like 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:41.340
 this application to be completely 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:44.670
 free at this time I think it has 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:46.379
 many benefits very many uses and 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.820
 I think you're going to be interested in 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.250
 first place when we open it 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.320
 We found some menus in the part of 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.719
 down I'm going to start from right to 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:58.140
 left if I click on this 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:59.340
 corner appears this submenu where 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.219
 first of all I am given the opportunity 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.559
 to use different types of lenses 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.600
 if I give a click here to lenses like you 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.119
 you can give me account appear here 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.220
 different types that is not precisely 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:14.369
 You must have a camera with these faces 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:17.340
 here you can take each one yourself 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:20.430
 of them and realize exactly how 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.560
 is that it works you can 'here and the 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.200
 happening is this is very interesting to 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.080
 I personally liked it a lot and so 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.399
 each of them creates an effect 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:32.880
 different according to what you 

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:35.490
 you need to really make your picture 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.799
 see spectacular if you want to go back 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:41.280
 to how he was in the first option 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:43.319
 it is always without lens or neutral of this 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.440
 side in the second option we have what 

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:48.720
 says film that has to do with the guy 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:51.030
 of roll on this side also we were 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.770
 They present many styles that really 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.259
 here I recommend that you give the 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:58.049
 opportunity to observe each one of 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:59.970
 them so that you get familiar and 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:02.190
 obviously you use them at the moment 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:05.220
 right sometimes we want to take 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:06.899
 some photo with some kind of effect and 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:08.340
 Well, if you know well where 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.750
 find each one of them 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.790
 obviously you are going to take a picture 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.140
 spectacular I'm going to come back here to 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.970
 principle where it says nothing 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:18.600
 down here we're going to select where 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:20.730
 says frame this from frame is like a like 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:22.380
 a framework obviously when selecting 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.510
 any of them, well, good 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:27.690
 presents what that type of frame is 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:30.240
 here you have many styles to choose 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:32.340
 there are many very attractive of many 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:35.490
 colors now if it depends what you 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:37.110
 you want to achieve with this type of photo 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:38.790
 I will put here that nothing if I give a 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:41.430
 click on that same section or on the 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:43.440
 corner on the right closes me this 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.810
 option and then we will see this 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:49.560
 another on this side where he gives me the 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:51.630
 opportunity to handle such brightness and 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:54.000
 how do you realize that it makes me certain 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:55.590
 values if I want to turn everything off and 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.350
 back to how he was 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:00.630
 I give a click to that I remove it little one 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:02.820
 where is the sun on the left side and 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:05.160
 down here we also have types of 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:07.769
 lights for example that's supposed to be 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:10.019
 a candle light a regular focus or 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:13.709
 light bulb on this side we have light 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:16.350
 white sun and so on all this for 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:19.650
 that you put it exactly like you 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:22.439
 you require if I give a click to the w 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:24.209
 I get paid the control of the medium is more 

00:03:22.439 --> 00:03:26.280
 I know it is to take the picture and 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:29.360
 we also have the option of 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:33.329
 configurations on this side where 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:35.970
 you will have the possibility to manage 

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:38.340
 some aspects regarding how you're going 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:41.340
 to take that picture for example if you want 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:44.430
 take a photo as a horizon u 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:45.599
 horizontal here you have it is not reached 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:48.090
 to see well because I'm really 

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:50.810
 projecting my monitor but well 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:54.120
 this makes it look horizontal 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:56.370
 we also have the possibility of 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:57.930
 capture video in the event that you 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:00.150
 you want so we have the same 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:02.310
 Standard photograph that's what 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:05.159
 we usually start has also a 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:07.859
 stabilizer if you move and that then 

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:10.470
 obviously try to stabilize you is 

00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:13.319
 stabilizer has three controls and you 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:15.150
 das average minimum and maximum account has 

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:17.729
 a lot more features on this side 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:19.709
 I really would not end up mentioning you 

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:23.039
 one by one what I really do 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:25.169
 I suggest you install it and an afternoon 

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:26.430
 you get to observe each one of these 

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:28.860
 options for what else 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:31.620
 you realize how that works for me 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:34.380
 I'm going to go back to standard on the side 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:36.060
 left in the corner if you realize 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:39.270
 here all those will appear 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:41.370
 photographs that I have already taken before 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:44.340
 this same section if I select this 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:47.639
 picture of the upper right side I have the 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:49.710
 option to edit this same below me 

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:52.620
 appear in this next section some 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:54.690
 controls for example that that looks like 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:57.120
 a magic wand if I give a click 

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:59.430
 so try to make me a correction of 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:01.229
 automatic way if I pay it then I 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:03.509
 come back to this as it was 

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:07.650
 originally also has what is the 

00:05:03.509 --> 00:05:09.660
 crop or to crop has here other 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:12.740
 things too that you can do for 

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:15.479
 example move the angle and there are very many 

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:17.550
 functions that even I have not yet 

00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:19.440
 explored as I told you from a 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:22.110
 principle, I really recommend that you 

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:24.120
 you analyze it once you have already 

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:26.699
 made any of these changes in the 

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:28.669
 upper left says don that 

00:05:26.699 --> 00:05:30.870
 means that the work is already 

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:32.910
 finished with respect to the edition that 

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:35.400
 you did but before giving it done 

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:38.070
 or right you see there are two icons 

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:40.320
 little ones if I give this one that 

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:42.120
 find the left side brings me 

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:44.550
 directly to the section that you're 

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:47.550
 seeing and this one that is on 

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:49.170
 this side is going to return the photo to 

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:51.590
 how it was originally if I 

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:54.540
 I give it if I click or edit it 

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:56.280
 technically I deleted anything that 

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:58.190
 I have done this photo I will give 

00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:00.360
 Done in the upper left 

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:02.220
 When I give it to you, it tells me that if 

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:04.380
 I want to save the changes or not save them 

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:06.180
 I'm going to say no to that 

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:09.030
 come back simply and simply to the 

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:11.580
 section where we were now when you 

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:13.590
 you go back to the photo in the part 

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:16.920
 lower left we also have this 

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:18.360
 control that is to share this photo 

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:20.430
 to any of the social networks that 

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:22.860
 you are seeing here even services 

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:25.530
 in the cloud as for example dropbox 

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:28.170
 google drive and any other service 

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:30.420
 to appear in this section here 

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:32.850
 You can also create a post card 

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:34.380
 which is like a postcard and 

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:37.260
 many more things I will give 

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:39.000
 cancel I hope you really take out 

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:41.670
 much benefit to this one 

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.740
 application if you click on the logo 

00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:47.130
 orange that we have up here in the middle 

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:48.900
 is going to return you to where we are 

00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:50.310
 we found initially I hope 

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:53.220
 really like this application 

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:55.680
 Look at the analysis, look at how many 

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:56.970
 options has what much you can do and 

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:58.830
 I say goodbye today my name is 

00:06:56.970 --> 00:07:00.870
