00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.170
 together preparing the words pasta 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.110
 salt one of the most basic doughs 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.519
 famous even easier to prepare 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:16.830
 suitable for making cakes 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.080
 also savory for sfizioserie then 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.830
 let us arm ourselves all india no rolling pin 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.869
 It will be the insecure pastry climbing 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:28.260
 to prepare the shortcrust pastry style a 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:31.980
 necessary rate 280 gr of white flour 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:35.010
 type 00 20 grams of parmesan cheese 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:37.980
 grated 2 eggs after we will use a 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:40.410
 his return after you have milk if 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:43.850
 necessary then will also explain the reason 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:46.590
 7 grams of salt and 100 g of butter 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:48.989
 we sifted the flour well 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:52.140
 operate to the now we add the 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:54.870
 grana cheese that I need to give a 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.520
 bit of particular flavor if you don't 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.410
 like the avoided grana cheese 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.510
 replace the same quantity then 20 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:05.489
 grams in this case with 20 grams of 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:08.850
 flour, add the fine salt 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:11.070
 we mix all the powders well and 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:14.270
 now we begin to reach the 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.530
 wet ingredients or butter that does 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:18.570
 slightly softened as you can 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:22.320
 see so it doesn't have to be right 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:24.210
 melted but not even cold from the fridge 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.619
 I recommend it to you 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.720
 consistency 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.100
 now or shell the split eggs i 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.619
 egg yolks from the egg whites for this recipe 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.689
 we will only use the yolks 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.670
 egg whites clearly don't throw them away 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:38.250
 you can use them to prepare 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.290
 exquisite macaroons and now we knead 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.960
 first with a wooden spoon and then a 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:45.420
 hand the pastry does not require one 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:49.049
 very long processing then worked 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:51.869
 It is the least I can milk 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:54.600
 we will use if necessary to help us 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:57.310
 to knead 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:00.160
 we worked the dough quickly 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:02.710
 until you get this consistency 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:04.150
 now what we have to do we wrap the 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:05.650
 our short pastry ball 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:07.660
 inside a sheet of film 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:10.030
 transparent and let them rest 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:12.520
 at least 30 minutes before laying the 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:14.860
 with the rolling pin in this video 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:17.200
