not everybody sees after the same but it

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.020 
not everybody sees after the same but it
all<00:00:37.500> pretty<00:00:37.800> much<00:00:38.040> starts<00:00:38.460> that<00:00:38.670> way<00:00:38.820> what

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
laces off the pass which it usually

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.220 
laces off the pass which it usually
isn't<00:00:44.820> because<00:00:45.239> the<00:00:45.329> ball<00:00:45.570> can<00:00:45.750> spend<00:00:46.050> any

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230
