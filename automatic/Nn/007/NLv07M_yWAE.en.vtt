case<00:01:09.510> it<00:01:09.780> was<00:01:10.110> a<00:01:10.549> Kickstarter<00:01:11.549> and<00:01:12.770> it<00:01:13.770> was

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
case it was a Kickstarter and it was

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.789 
case it was a Kickstarter and it was
successfully<00:01:14.549> funded<00:01:14.580> and<00:01:15.360> they<00:01:16.259> produced<00:01:16.500> it

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
successfully funded and they produced it

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.060 
successfully funded and they produced it
in<00:01:16.890> several<00:01:17.130> colors<00:01:17.580> I<00:01:18.350> shopped<00:01:19.350> long<00:01:19.830> and

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
in several colors I shopped long and

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.899 
in several colors I shopped long and
hard<00:01:20.460> to<00:01:20.880> get<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:21.450> cyan<00:01:22.229> version<00:01:22.920> so<00:01:23.159> it's<00:01:23.670> an

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
hard to get the cyan version so it's an

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:29.420 
hard to get the cyan version so it's an
anodized<00:01:24.900> blue<00:01:26.270> but<00:01:27.740> it<00:01:28.740> also<00:01:28.950> came<00:01:29.280> in

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
anodized blue but it also came in

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.219 
anodized blue but it also came in
several<00:01:29.670> other<00:01:29.909> colors<00:01:30.360> I<00:01:30.479> think<00:01:30.570> they're

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
several other colors I think they're

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.789 
several other colors I think they're
pretty<00:01:31.500> much<00:01:31.650> selling<00:01:32.189> now<00:01:32.430> just<00:01:33.060> the<00:01:33.799> silver

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
pretty much selling now just the silver

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:39.109 
pretty much selling now just the silver
black<00:01:35.280> and<00:01:35.579> red<00:01:36.439> so<00:01:37.439> the<00:01:37.619> green<00:01:38.009> and<00:01:38.939> the

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
black and red so the green and the

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.050 
black and red so the green and the
tsiyon<00:01:39.479> I<00:01:39.930> think<00:01:40.229> worked<00:01:40.560> and<00:01:41.189> because<00:01:41.970> they

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
tsiyon I think worked and because they

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.039 
tsiyon I think worked and because they
weren't<00:01:42.210> popular<00:01:42.390> enough<00:01:42.780> but<00:01:44.420> the<00:01:45.420> cost<00:01:45.750> of

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
weren't popular enough but the cost of

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.929 
weren't popular enough but the cost of
the<00:01:46.110> item<00:01:46.619> is<00:01:47.220> big

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
the item is big

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:52.039 
the item is big
ok<00:01:48.270> this<00:01:48.509> cost<00:01:49.170> me<00:01:49.619> a<00:01:50.310> hundred<00:01:51.049> Australian

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
ok this cost me a hundred Australian

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.050 
ok this cost me a hundred Australian
dollars<00:01:52.439> now<00:01:52.710> if<00:01:53.430> you're<00:01:53.610> in<00:01:53.700> the<00:01:53.790> u.s.<00:01:54.030> you

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
dollars now if you're in the u.s. you

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.179 
dollars now if you're in the u.s. you
could<00:01:54.360> probably<00:01:54.540> get<00:01:55.020> it<00:01:55.170> cheaper<00:01:55.740> because<00:01:55.920> I

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
could probably get it cheaper because I

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:59.630 
could probably get it cheaper because I
was<00:01:56.610> charged<00:01:57.000> a<00:01:57.229> ridiculous<00:01:58.430> $30<00:01:59.430> for

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
was charged a ridiculous $30 for

shipping<00:02:00.030> from<00:02:00.689> the<00:02:00.840> US<00:02:01.700> but<00:02:02.700> the<00:02:02.939> case<00:02:03.149> itself

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
shipping from the US but the case itself

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:07.880 
shipping from the US but the case itself
cost<00:02:04.189> $70<00:02:05.189> now<00:02:05.520> the<00:02:06.329> $70<00:02:06.899> I<00:02:07.049> expect<00:02:07.409> a<00:02:07.500> lot<00:02:07.710> I

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
cost $70 now the $70 I expect a lot I

cost $70 now the $70 I expect a lot I
expect<00:02:08.340> this<00:02:08.550> to<00:02:08.610> work<00:02:09.259> perfectly<00:02:10.259> and

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
expect this to work perfectly and

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.800 
expect this to work perfectly and
I<00:02:12.090> expect<00:02:12.959> it<00:02:13.050> to<00:02:13.080> be<00:02:13.170> better<00:02:13.379> than<00:02:13.650> any<00:02:13.890> of<00:02:14.250> the

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
I expect it to be better than any of the

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.580 
I expect it to be better than any of the
$10<00:02:15.810> crappy<00:02:16.379> ones<00:02:16.560> I<00:02:16.800> can<00:02:17.129> order<00:02:17.459> from<00:02:17.610> China

$10 crappy ones I can order from China
is<00:02:19.590> that<00:02:19.980> the<00:02:20.160> case

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
is that the case

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:27.830 
is that the case
mm<00:02:22.670> not<00:02:23.670> really<00:02:24.050> for<00:02:25.220> $100<00:02:26.220> our<00:02:26.819> 70<00:02:27.420> bucks<00:02:27.599> okay

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
mm not really for $100 our 70 bucks okay

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
these tiny little screws they are very

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:02.420 
these tiny little screws they are very
difficult<00:02:58.140> to<00:02:58.530> fix<00:02:58.769> into<00:02:59.670> place<00:03:00.709> or<00:03:01.709> rather<00:03:01.980> to

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
difficult to fix into place or rather to

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:06.500 
difficult to fix into place or rather to
keep<00:03:02.730> in<00:03:03.030> place<00:03:03.239> so<00:03:03.780> every<00:03:04.290> week<00:03:04.670> I<00:03:05.670> need<00:03:06.209> to<00:03:06.360> go

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
keep in place so every week I need to go

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:09.229 
keep in place so every week I need to go
back<00:03:06.690> to<00:03:07.049> the<00:03:07.140> box<00:03:07.319> that<00:03:08.160> they<00:03:08.310> sent<00:03:08.610> me<00:03:08.760> the

easily<00:03:38.549> so<00:03:39.440> every<00:03:40.440> week<00:03:40.799> I<00:03:41.040> will<00:03:41.160> have<00:03:41.310> to

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:41.579 
easily so every week I will have to

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:45.680 
easily so every week I will have to
tighten<00:03:41.850> up<00:03:42.150> these<00:03:42.920> things<00:03:44.420> little<00:03:45.420> screws

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:45.690 
tighten up these things little screws

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:48.199 
tighten up these things little screws
with<00:03:45.930> the<00:03:45.959> tiny<00:03:46.290> allen<00:03:46.680> key<00:03:47.000> and<00:03:48.000> that's<00:03:48.090> a

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209 
with the tiny allen key and that's a

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:51.050 
with the tiny allen key and that's a
pain<00:03:48.389> in<00:03:48.510> the<00:03:48.540> ass<00:03:49.220> it<00:03:50.220> shouldn't<00:03:50.639> come<00:03:50.790> loose

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
pain in the ass it shouldn't come loose

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:54.830 
pain in the ass it shouldn't come loose
the<00:03:51.389> screws<00:03:51.900> need<00:03:52.079> a<00:03:52.109> better<00:03:52.319> design<00:03:53.840> second

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
the screws need a better design second

00:03:54.840 --> 00:04:00.020 
the screws need a better design second
problem<00:03:55.049> is<00:03:55.519> the<00:03:56.519> flash<00:03:57.000> so<00:03:58.730> that's<00:03:59.730> the

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
problem is the flash so that's the

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:02.870 
problem is the flash so that's the
that's<00:04:00.329> the<00:04:00.569> distance<00:04:00.840> from<00:04:00.959> the<00:04:01.170> flash<00:04:01.880> to

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:02.880 
that's the distance from the flash to

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:06.470 
that's the distance from the flash to
the<00:04:03.000> metal<00:04:03.359> and<00:04:03.569> it's<00:04:03.690> actually<00:04:04.549> not<00:04:05.549> to<00:04:06.090> spec

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480 
the metal and it's actually not to spec

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:11.050 
the metal and it's actually not to spec
this<00:04:06.870> does<00:04:07.470> not<00:04:07.739> conform<00:04:08.160> with<00:04:08.459> Apple's

specifications on flash distance from

specifications on flash distance from
the<00:04:13.950> case<00:04:14.160> so<00:04:15.709> there's<00:04:16.709> a<00:04:16.829> nasty<00:04:17.010> result<00:04:17.400> of

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:17.459 
the case so there's a nasty result of

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:18.349 
the case so there's a nasty result of
this<00:04:17.549> that<00:04:17.700> I'll<00:04:17.789> show<00:04:17.910> you<00:04:17.970> in<00:04:18.030> a<00:04:18.060> second<00:04:18.329> but

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:18.359 
this that I'll show you in a second but

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:19.940 
this that I'll show you in a second but
actually<00:04:18.810> since<00:04:19.260> I'm<00:04:19.440> just<00:04:19.470> at<00:04:19.709> this<00:04:19.799> angle

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:19.950 
actually since I'm just at this angle

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:22.279 
actually since I'm just at this angle
you<00:04:20.130> can<00:04:20.250> also<00:04:20.400> see<00:04:20.760> the<00:04:21.359> case<00:04:21.570> scratches<00:04:22.169> the

00:04:22.279 --> 00:04:22.289 
you can also see the case scratches the

00:04:22.289 --> 00:04:24.140 
you can also see the case scratches the
iPhone

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:24.150 
iPhone

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:26.060 
iPhone
I'm<00:04:24.389> not<00:04:24.750> that<00:04:25.080> pressures<00:04:25.500> about<00:04:25.710> scratches

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:26.070 
I'm not that pressures about scratches

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:27.890 
I'm not that pressures about scratches
on<00:04:26.160> my<00:04:26.190> iPhone<00:04:26.490> but<00:04:26.639> the<00:04:26.970> this<00:04:27.330> will<00:04:27.509> scratch

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:27.900 
on my iPhone but the this will scratch

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.310 
on my iPhone but the this will scratch
it<00:04:28.080> definitely<00:04:29.040> on<00:04:29.190> all<00:04:29.430> four<00:04:29.699> corners

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:30.320 
it definitely on all four corners

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:33.529 
it definitely on all four corners
because<00:04:31.320> of<00:04:31.470> those<00:04:31.590> loosening<00:04:32.400> screws<00:04:32.789> and

00:04:33.529 --> 00:04:33.539 
because of those loosening screws and

00:04:33.539 --> 00:04:35.330 
because of those loosening screws and
then<00:04:33.780> if<00:04:34.110> it<00:04:34.289> ever<00:04:34.500> moves<00:04:34.800> about<00:04:35.070> all<00:04:35.250> the

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:35.340 
then if it ever moves about all the

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:38.060 
then if it ever moves about all the
things<00:04:35.639> come<00:04:36.000> off<00:04:36.030> it<00:04:36.389> will<00:04:36.509> just<00:04:36.889> scratch<00:04:37.889> the

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:38.070 
things come off it will just scratch the

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:41.570 
things come off it will just scratch the
case<00:04:38.250> so<00:04:39.860> look<00:04:40.860> I<00:04:40.949> bought<00:04:41.190> this<00:04:41.310> on<00:04:41.430> the

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:41.580 
case so look I bought this on the

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:43.790 
case so look I bought this on the
assumption<00:04:41.910> or<00:04:42.389> not<00:04:42.600> only<00:04:42.780> actual<00:04:43.139> assumption

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:43.800 
assumption or not only actual assumption

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:47.060 
assumption or not only actual assumption
I<00:04:43.949> had<00:04:44.460> checked<00:04:44.820> first<00:04:45.120> that<00:04:45.419> they<00:04:45.570> had<00:04:46.070> done

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:47.070 
I had checked first that they had done

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:49.400 
I had checked first that they had done
their<00:04:47.220> research<00:04:47.280> with<00:04:47.880> the<00:04:48.120> flash<00:04:48.900> distance

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:49.410 
their research with the flash distance

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:52.129 
their research with the flash distance
and<00:04:50.280> if<00:04:50.970> you<00:04:51.150> actually<00:04:51.330> have<00:04:51.660> a<00:04:51.690> look<00:04:51.870> here

flat-out lie or very poor testing I
assume<00:05:35.580> if<00:05:35.699> they've<00:05:35.880> tested<00:05:36.270> it<00:05:36.360> with<00:05:36.660> the

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:36.930 
assume if they've tested it with the

assume if they've tested it with the

reflection wouldn't have occurred but if

00:05:43.229 --> 00:05:45.500 
reflection wouldn't have occurred but if
they<00:05:43.320> had<00:05:43.470> tested<00:05:43.830> it<00:05:43.949> with<00:05:44.070> any<00:05:44.310> colors<00:05:44.760> let

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:45.510 
they had tested it with any colors let

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:50.029 
they had tested it with any colors let
me<00:05:45.630> show<00:05:45.810> you<00:05:45.900> the<00:05:46.050> result<00:05:47.900> so<00:05:48.900> this<00:05:49.229> is<00:05:49.590> I've

00:05:50.029 --> 00:05:50.039

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:18.000 
but that's a double-edged sword because

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.990 
but that's a double-edged sword because
it's<00:07:18.210> really<00:07:18.449> not<00:07:18.720> strong<00:07:18.960> enough<00:07:19.080> these

00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:20.000 
it's really not strong enough these

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.760 
it's really not strong enough these
corners<00:07:21.000> do<00:07:21.300> move<00:07:21.600> around<00:07:21.630> in<00:07:22.289> your<00:07:22.440> pocket

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:22.770 
corners do move around in your pocket

00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:26.210 
corners do move around in your pocket
and<00:07:23.750> so<00:07:24.750> occasionally<00:07:25.080> you'll<00:07:25.560> be<00:07:25.740> you<00:07:26.160> know

00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:26.220 
and so occasionally you'll be you know

00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:27.800 
and so occasionally you'll be you know
you'll<00:07:26.610> be<00:07:26.729> taking<00:07:27.060> your<00:07:27.090> phone<00:07:27.330> and<00:07:27.690> you'll

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:27.810 
you'll be taking your phone and you'll

00:07:27.810 --> 00:07:30.200 
you'll be taking your phone and you'll
need<00:07:27.960> to<00:07:28.080> pop<00:07:28.800> those<00:07:29.070> little<00:07:29.669> corner<00:07:30.000> pieces

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:30.210 
need to pop those little corner pieces

00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:33.500 
need to pop those little corner pieces
back<00:07:30.660> over<00:07:31.110> the<00:07:31.199> corner<00:07:31.530> there<00:07:32.030> when<00:07:33.030> it<00:07:33.150> comes

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:33.510 
back over the corner there when it comes

00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:35.750 
back over the corner there when it comes
to<00:07:33.690> sitting<00:07:33.960> on<00:07:34.050> the<00:07:34.169> desk<00:07:34.410> it<00:07:35.160> will<00:07:35.340> sit<00:07:35.610> off

00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:35.760 
to sitting on the desk it will sit off

00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:37.370 
to sitting on the desk it will sit off
the<00:07:36.000> desk<00:07:36.240> which<00:07:36.510> is<00:07:36.539> good<00:07:36.870> I<00:07:37.080> like<00:07:37.350> that

00:07:37.370 --> 00:07:37.380 
the desk which is good I like that

00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:40.279 
the desk which is good I like that
obviously<00:07:37.979> one<00:07:38.550> of<00:07:38.639> the<00:07:38.729> reasons<00:07:39.270> you<00:07:39.479> use<00:07:40.260> a

00:07:40.279 --> 00:07:40.289 
obviously one of the reasons you use a

00:07:40.289 --> 00:07:44.960 
obviously one of the reasons you use a
case<00:07:41.270> so<00:07:42.500> look<00:07:43.500> everything<00:07:43.889> about<00:07:44.130> this<00:07:44.400> looks

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:44.970 
case so look everything about this looks

00:07:44.970 --> 00:07:47.719 
case so look everything about this looks
brilliant<00:07:45.389> but<00:07:45.780> unfortunately<00:07:46.620> due<00:07:47.310> to<00:07:47.340> a<00:07:47.460> few

00:07:47.719 --> 00:07:47.729 
brilliant but unfortunately due to a few

00:07:47.729 --> 00:07:52.040 
brilliant but unfortunately due to a few
execution<00:07:48.479> problems<00:07:49.639> that<00:07:50.639> need<00:07:50.880> fixing<00:07:51.599> that

00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:52.050 
execution problems that need fixing that

00:07:52.050 --> 00:07:56.150 
execution problems that need fixing that
would<00:07:52.229> be<00:07:52.440> the<00:07:53.720> flimsiness<00:07:54.720> of<00:07:55.110> these<00:07:55.440> arms

00:07:56.150 --> 00:07:56.160 
would be the flimsiness of these arms

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:57.440 
would be the flimsiness of these arms
that<00:07:56.370> cause<00:07:56.580> you<00:07:56.729> to<00:07:56.760> need<00:07:57.000> to<00:07:57.090> pop<00:07:57.270> it<00:07:57.419> back

00:07:57.440 --> 00:07:57.450 
that cause you to need to pop it back

00:07:57.450 --> 00:08:00.770 
that cause you to need to pop it back
into<00:07:57.720> place<00:07:58.250> the<00:07:59.250> screws<00:08:00.060> being<00:08:00.450> inadequate

00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:00.780 
into place the screws being inadequate

00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:03.230 
into place the screws being inadequate
meaning<00:08:01.620> you<00:08:01.710> have<00:08:01.860> to<00:08:01.889> retighten<00:08:02.639> them<00:08:02.820> every

00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:03.240 
meaning you have to retighten them every

00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:06.920 
meaning you have to retighten them every
week<00:08:03.450> and<00:08:03.830> the<00:08:04.830> flash<00:08:05.190> being<00:08:05.520> too<00:08:05.729> close<00:08:06.090> to

00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:06.930 
week and the flash being too close to

00:08:06.930 --> 00:08:10.339 
week and the flash being too close to
the<00:08:07.400> anodized<00:08:08.400> piece

00:08:10.339 --> 00:08:10.349 
the anodized piece

00:08:10.349 --> 00:08:13.670 
the anodized piece
I<00:08:10.380> wouldn't<00:08:11.010> recommend<00:08:11.130> this<00:08:11.610> so<00:08:12.000> I<00:08:12.680> hope

00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:13.680 
I wouldn't recommend this so I hope

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:16.790 
I wouldn't recommend this so I hope
you've<00:08:13.860> enjoyed<00:08:14.190> the<00:08:14.669> review<00:08:14.849> and<00:08:15.680> good<00:08:16.680> luck
