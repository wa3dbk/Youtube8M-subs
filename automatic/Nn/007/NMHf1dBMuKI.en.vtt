all<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:13.470> time<00:01:13.909> often<00:01:14.909> on<00:01:15.240> a<00:01:15.270> lot<00:01:15.420> of<00:01:15.450> tractors

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
all the time often on a lot of tractors

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.810 
all the time often on a lot of tractors
now<00:01:15.990> with<00:01:16.140> front-end<00:01:16.470> loaders<00:01:16.860> attached<00:01:17.250> it

now with front-end loaders attached it

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.520 
now with front-end loaders attached it
makes<00:01:18.060> it<00:01:18.210> really<00:01:18.360> awkward<00:01:18.780> to<00:01:18.810> get<00:01:19.080> into<00:01:19.409> the

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
makes it really awkward to get into the

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.560 
makes it really awkward to get into the
oil<00:01:19.650> dipstick<00:01:19.920> area<00:01:20.520> but<00:01:21.060> how<00:01:21.270> would<00:01:21.450> have

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
oil dipstick area but how would have

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.060 
oil dipstick area but how would have
made<00:01:21.780> this<00:01:21.930> a<00:01:21.990> really<00:01:22.290> neat<00:01:22.560> feature<00:01:22.830> where

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
made this a really neat feature where

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.130 
made this a really neat feature where
they've<00:01:23.220> cut<00:01:23.400> a<00:01:23.430> hole<00:01:23.700> away<00:01:23.909> so<00:01:24.689> you<00:01:24.750> can<00:01:24.930> quite

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
they've cut a hole away so you can quite

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.880 
they've cut a hole away so you can quite
easily<00:01:25.350> access<00:01:26.070> it<00:01:26.280> through<00:01:27.710> without<00:01:28.710> too

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
easily access it through without too

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.710 
easily access it through without too
much<00:01:29.009> drama<00:01:29.250> at<00:01:29.579> all<00:01:29.700> so<00:01:29.939> it's<00:01:30.119> a<00:01:30.150> really<00:01:30.509> good

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
much drama at all so it's a really good

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.420 
much drama at all so it's a really good
feature<00:01:30.960> to<00:01:31.470> make<00:01:31.500> sure<00:01:31.829> daily<00:01:32.250> maintenance

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
feature to make sure daily maintenance

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.270 
feature to make sure daily maintenance
is<00:01:32.759> carried<00:01:33.090> out<00:01:33.770> access<00:01:34.770> to<00:01:34.829> the<00:01:35.009> whole

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
is carried out access to the whole

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.490 
is carried out access to the whole
engine<00:01:35.759> bay<00:01:36.000> and<00:01:36.329> of<00:01:36.689> course<00:01:36.900> the<00:01:37.020> air<00:01:37.170> cleaner

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.260 
engine bay and of course the air cleaner
assembly<00:01:37.680> and<00:01:38.189> that<00:01:38.220> is<00:01:38.490> it<00:01:38.790> made<00:01:39.060> really

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
assembly and that is it made really

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.330 
assembly and that is it made really
simple<00:01:39.720> because<00:01:39.869> the<00:01:40.290> bonnet<00:01:40.680> fully<00:01:40.979> swings

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
simple because the bonnet fully swings

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.980 
simple because the bonnet fully swings
right<00:01:41.579> away<00:01:41.850> it's<00:01:42.119> all<00:01:42.329> one<00:01:42.509> panel<00:01:44.810> so<00:01:45.810> it's

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
right away it's all one panel so it's

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.230 
right away it's all one panel so it's
just<00:01:46.110> a<00:01:46.259> rather<00:01:46.409> sliding<00:01:47.280> outer<00:01:47.430> cover<00:01:47.759> air

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
just a rather sliding outer cover air

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.090 
just a rather sliding outer cover air
cleaner<00:01:48.659> slips<00:01:48.990> out<00:01:49.140> and<00:01:49.380> you<00:01:49.500> can<00:01:49.680> clean<00:01:49.950> it

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
cleaner slips out and you can clean it

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.590 
cleaner slips out and you can clean it
and<00:01:50.340> basically<00:01:50.579> that<00:01:51.030> covers<00:01:51.420> all<00:01:51.540> our

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600

servicing of the tractor that you would

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.370

as<00:03:51.629> I<00:03:52.590> said<00:03:52.769> a<00:03:52.799> lot<00:03:52.950> of<00:03:53.010> new<00:03:53.220> tractors<00:03:53.670> now<00:03:53.879> they

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120 
as I said a lot of new tractors now they

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.059 
as I said a lot of new tractors now they
are<00:03:54.180> all<00:03:54.299> very<00:03:54.510> similar<00:03:54.900> in<00:03:55.140> their<00:03:55.290> setup<00:03:55.650> but

00:03:56.059 --> 00:03:56.069 
are all very similar in their setup but

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:57.710 
are all very similar in their setup but
a<00:03:56.220> couple<00:03:56.640> of<00:03:56.730> really<00:03:57.000> good<00:03:57.180> features<00:03:57.599> that

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
a couple of really good features that

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.390 
a couple of really good features that
jumped<00:03:58.049> out<00:03:58.170> at<00:03:58.230> me<00:03:58.379> as<00:03:58.590> soon<00:03:58.769> as<00:03:58.890> I<00:03:59.010> jumped<00:03:59.250> in
