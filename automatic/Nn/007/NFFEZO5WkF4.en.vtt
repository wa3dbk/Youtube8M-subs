 lag problems 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:53.190
 the advice to install also the opt 

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:53.520
 file because it really reduces the 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:57.900

 once this procedure is done 

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:14.760
 you will have to open minecraft and it will work 

00:05:10.979 --> 00:05:17.039
