the<00:03:47.870> game<00:03:48.140> but<00:03:48.590> if<00:03:48.739> you<00:03:48.920> guys<00:03:49.100> don't<00:03:49.400> feel<00:03:49.700> that

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:49.880 
the game but if you guys don't feel that

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:52.270 
the game but if you guys don't feel that
this<00:03:50.060> perk<00:03:50.330> is<00:03:50.510> necessary<00:03:51.170> then<00:03:51.620> I<00:03:51.769> definitely

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.280 
this perk is necessary then I definitely

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:54.340 
this perk is necessary then I definitely
advise<00:03:52.730> you<00:03:52.970> guys<00:03:53.000> to<00:03:53.239> choose<00:03:53.660> blind<00:03:54.110> down

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:54.350 
advise you guys to choose blind down

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:57.009 
advise you guys to choose blind down
however<00:03:55.130> i<00:03:55.430> will<00:03:55.489> be<00:03:55.910> using<00:03:56.060> peripherals<00:03:56.959> for

00:03:57.009 --> 00:03:57.019 
however i will be using peripherals for

00:03:57.019 --> 00:03:59.530 
however i will be using peripherals for
this<00:03:57.440> class<00:03:57.709> setup<00:03:58.130> as<00:03:58.280> it<00:03:58.820> will<00:03:58.970> definitely

00:03:59.530 --> 00:03:59.540 
this class setup as it will definitely

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:01.780 
this class setup as it will definitely
call<00:03:59.750> inside<00:04:00.170> with<00:04:00.739> our<00:04:00.920> killstreaks<00:04:01.580> which

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:01.790 
call inside with our killstreaks which

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:05.170 
call inside with our killstreaks which
I'll<00:04:02.000> get<00:04:02.180> into<00:04:02.239> a<00:04:02.750> little<00:04:02.810> bit<00:04:03.440> later<00:04:04.180> moving

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:05.180 
I'll get into a little bit later moving

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:06.789 
I'll get into a little bit later moving
on<00:04:05.450> to<00:04:05.480> perk<00:04:05.959> free<00:04:06.290> we're<00:04:06.500> going<00:04:06.620> to<00:04:06.680> be<00:04:06.769> using

00:04:06.789 --> 00:04:06.799 
on to perk free we're going to be using

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:09.400 
on to perk free we're going to be using
two<00:04:07.459> perks<00:04:07.850> which<00:04:08.360> is<00:04:08.540> going<00:04:08.690> to<00:04:08.750> be<00:04:08.810> toughness

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:09.410 
two perks which is going to be toughness

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:11.470 
two perks which is going to be toughness
of<00:04:09.560> course<00:04:09.950> allowing<00:04:10.519> us<00:04:10.670> to<00:04:10.700> reduce<00:04:11.030> our

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:11.480 
of course allowing us to reduce our

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:14.020 
of course allowing us to reduce our
flinch<00:04:11.900> which<00:04:12.410> will<00:04:12.620> allow<00:04:12.799> us<00:04:13.040> to<00:04:13.280> win<00:04:13.549> a<00:04:13.760> lot

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:14.030 
flinch which will allow us to win a lot

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:16.270 
flinch which will allow us to win a lot
more<00:04:14.209> gunfights<00:04:14.750> expecially<00:04:15.620> at<00:04:16.040> those

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:16.280 
more gunfights expecially at those

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:19.060 
more gunfights expecially at those
longer<00:04:16.669> ranges<00:04:17.150> and<00:04:17.440> scavenger<00:04:18.440> which<00:04:18.919> is

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:19.070 
longer ranges and scavenger which is

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:21.160 
longer ranges and scavenger which is
going<00:04:19.250> to<00:04:19.310> allow<00:04:19.400> us<00:04:19.700> to<00:04:20.000> replenish<00:04:20.419> ammo

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:21.170 
going to allow us to replenish ammo

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:23.500 
going to allow us to replenish ammo
therefore<00:04:21.860> if<00:04:21.950> we<00:04:21.980> run<00:04:22.400> out<00:04:22.430> of<00:04:22.550> ammo<00:04:23.030> halfway

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:23.510 
therefore if we run out of ammo halfway

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:25.720 
therefore if we run out of ammo halfway
through<00:04:23.810> our<00:04:23.960> blood<00:04:24.440> thirsty<00:04:25.010> we'll<00:04:25.490> be<00:04:25.610> able

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:25.730 
through our blood thirsty we'll be able

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:28.300 
through our blood thirsty we'll be able
to<00:04:25.850> replenish<00:04:26.330> that<00:04:26.510> ammo<00:04:27.110> and<00:04:27.290> therefore<00:04:28.160> be

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:28.310 
to replenish that ammo and therefore be

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:30.160 
to replenish that ammo and therefore be
able<00:04:28.550> to<00:04:28.670> get<00:04:28.820> that<00:04:28.940> blood<00:04:29.180> thirsty<00:04:29.630> for<00:04:30.140> that
