now<00:03:11.130> our<00:03:11.370> dowels<00:03:11.880> will<00:03:12.060> go<00:03:12.210> roughly<00:03:12.900> to<00:03:13.650> on

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
now our dowels will go roughly to on

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.250 
now our dowels will go roughly to on
these<00:03:14.310> two<00:03:14.490> spots<00:03:14.820> right<00:03:15.090> here<00:03:15.260> sandwiching

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
these two spots right here sandwiching

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.050 
these two spots right here sandwiching
the<00:03:16.290> bottles<00:03:16.680> in<00:03:16.800> between<00:03:17.130> them<00:03:17.340> but<00:03:17.730> leaving

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
the bottles in between them but leaving

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.030 
the bottles in between them but leaving
some<00:03:18.240> space<00:03:18.540> here<00:03:18.840> at<00:03:19.020> the<00:03:19.200> edge<00:03:19.350> so<00:03:19.920> it

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
some space here at the edge so it

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:21.980 
some space here at the edge so it
doesn't<00:03:20.280> become<00:03:20.370> tippy<00:03:20.940> and<00:03:20.970> unstable<00:03:21.570> the

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:21.990 
doesn't become tippy and unstable the

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:23.780 
doesn't become tippy and unstable the
corresponding<00:03:22.680> other<00:03:22.830> two<00:03:23.040> will<00:03:23.250> also<00:03:23.430> go

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
corresponding other two will also go

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:25.760 
corresponding other two will also go
right<00:03:24.030> about<00:03:24.630> here<00:03:24.960> just<00:03:25.290> enough<00:03:25.470> to<00:03:25.590> store

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:25.770 
right about here just enough to store

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:27.950 
right about here just enough to store
the<00:03:25.920> two<00:03:26.070> bottles<00:03:26.460> on<00:03:26.610> the<00:03:26.730> inside<00:03:27.120> and<00:03:27.420> again

our<00:03:59.530> top<00:03:59.770> and<00:04:00.010> our<00:04:00.100> bottom<00:04:00.460> plate<00:04:00.700> we're<00:04:01.120> gonna

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:01.240 
our top and our bottom plate we're gonna

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:03.390 
our top and our bottom plate we're gonna
go<00:04:01.420> ahead<00:04:01.570> and<00:04:01.750> drill<00:04:02.560> through<00:04:02.860> the<00:04:03.040> top<00:04:03.190> in

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:03.400 
go ahead and drill through the top in

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:04.800 
go ahead and drill through the top in
the<00:04:03.490> bottom<00:04:03.640> plate<00:04:04.060> so<00:04:04.300> that<00:04:04.570> they're

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:04.810 
the bottom plate so that they're

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:06.420 
the bottom plate so that they're
symmetrical<00:04:05.380> we<00:04:05.500> have<00:04:05.620> them<00:04:05.770> stacked<00:04:06.130> here

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:06.430 
symmetrical we have them stacked here

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:08.940 
symmetrical we have them stacked here
one<00:04:06.670> on<00:04:06.790> top<00:04:06.940> of<00:04:07.000> the<00:04:07.180> other<00:04:07.420> and<00:04:07.690> so<00:04:08.590> the<00:04:08.740> holes

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:08.950 
one on top of the other and so the holes

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:10.050 
one on top of the other and so the holes
are<00:04:09.100> gonna<00:04:09.190> line<00:04:09.490> up<00:04:09.520> but<00:04:09.730> we<00:04:09.820> don't<00:04:09.880> get

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:10.060 
are gonna line up but we don't get

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:11.310 
are gonna line up but we don't get
something<00:04:10.270> looks<00:04:10.510> like<00:04:10.630> a<00:04:10.720> leaning<00:04:11.080> tower

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:11.320 
something looks like a leaning tower

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:12.870 
something looks like a leaning tower
even<00:04:11.740> though<00:04:11.830> it<00:04:11.950> might<00:04:12.070> look<00:04:12.280> good<00:04:12.550> according

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:12.880 
even though it might look good according

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:14.490 
even though it might look good according
to<00:04:13.030> the<00:04:13.180> ruler<00:04:13.480> there's<00:04:13.960> always<00:04:14.200> some

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:14.500 
to the ruler there's always some

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:15.540 
to the ruler there's always some
variance<00:04:14.890> whenever<00:04:15.130> you're<00:04:15.220> working<00:04:15.460> with

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:15.550 
variance whenever you're working with

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:17.460 
variance whenever you're working with
the<00:04:15.640> wood<00:04:15.760> so<00:04:16.180> let's<00:04:16.330> go<00:04:16.450> ahead<00:04:16.570> and<00:04:17.170> we're

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:17.470 
the wood so let's go ahead and we're

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:19.920 
the wood so let's go ahead and we're
gonna<00:04:17.549> clamp<00:04:18.549> these<00:04:18.700> together<00:04:18.940> here<00:04:19.269> make

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:19.930 
gonna clamp these together here make

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:21.870 
gonna clamp these together here make
sure<00:04:20.080> everything<00:04:20.320> remains<00:04:20.560> true<00:04:20.890> everything

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:21.880 
sure everything remains true everything

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:23.610 
sure everything remains true everything
looks<00:04:22.090> good<00:04:22.330> we<00:04:22.480> got<00:04:22.600> all<00:04:22.720> our<00:04:22.750> finish<00:04:23.260> edges

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:23.620 
looks good we got all our finish edges

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:26.250 
looks good we got all our finish edges
lined<00:04:23.860> up<00:04:24.450> and<00:04:25.450> we'll<00:04:25.600> go<00:04:25.720> ahead<00:04:25.930> and<00:04:26.050> get<00:04:26.140> to

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:26.260 
lined up and we'll go ahead and get to

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:57.459 
lined up and we'll go ahead and get to
work<00:04:26.470> with<00:04:26.890> the<00:04:27.010> drilling
