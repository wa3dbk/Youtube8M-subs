00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:08.220
 a bit felt my film crate 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:16.680
 Today , it's about this one, among other things 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:18.330
 movie real estate let's go I notice 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.310
 just me idiot it's not about 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.710
 batman begins and the dark knight 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.619
 no matter we start with the mobile 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.150
 namely the first clock knows their areal 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.099
 Clearly in all women I need it 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.390
 Do not ask the question but you know her 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.969
 also this cover here 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.829
 that's the original cover that time 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.930
 was released for the film launch and 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.000
 has since been withdrawn why 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.090
 look closely 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.739
 I will not win then I will 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.020
 it looks a bit closer now 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.360
 maybe not then then 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.309
 maybe that's it 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.980
 and now everyone should realize that there 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:55.710
 actually a penis is hidden in the 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.180
 castle of king of the hesse yes 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.520
 actually king triton in any case 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.050
 very many people claim that 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.640
 to see and you have to be honest 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.480
 said to be pretty blind not to do that 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.250
 to recognize 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.840
 the drawer of the cover has been around for years 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.430
 again and again he denies that 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.110
 intention as pure has painted anyway 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.210
 There was a whole series of complaints 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.320
 by worried parents now gives 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.790
 the cover only in one 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.680
 modified form 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:20.490
 Now the lettering is not over 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:22.710
 These closed and where we already there 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.840
 are king of the lions was 19 94 years 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.869
 most successful films of the year and 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.520
 was sued why because a biologist 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:32.280
 the film has seen and was the opinion 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.409
 that the hyenas in the film defamed 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.270
 because they are considered deceitful 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.159
 are shown and looks like this 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.799
 who do not live it in real 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.590
 that's why he filed suit 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:44.520
 but was smashed 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:48.899
 Let's sue everyone 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:50.520
 discounts lindsay lohan sam raimi knows 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:53.220
 Maybe you as a director of dance 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.259
 the devil of the darkness of 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.299
 film in spiderman or of may 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.619
 is of course did not know about him 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.659
 that he has a good luck charm to it 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.820
 almost every one of his movies houses 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:04.710
 actually there is only one movie in 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.420
 not to this car 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.640
 this is his favorite car than he 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.319
 indeed in every single one stands the 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.000
 only movie where the car can not be seen 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:13.200
 by the way, it's the wizard of oz, though 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.430
 I think it would be a bit too 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.819
 the car has been difficult 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.819
 accommodate 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.100
 one of my favorite movies and that 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.770
 probably for you too 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:26.190
 The condemned is considered a modern classic 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:28.620
 even the imdb top 250 list proves that 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.330
 where the film since felt times on 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:32.069
 rank one, you might rank 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:35.250
 did not know that the film in the year 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:36.930
 In 1994 when he came out massive flopped 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.850
 No one wanted to see it in there 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:41.880
 the year even only has place 51 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:43.440
 landed far behind street continue with 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.120
 Jean Claude Van Damme can do it 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.280
 sometimes go because you were absolute 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.489
 milestone as a movie and no one goes 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.489
 purely 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:55.910
 [Applause] 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.910
 [Music] 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:01.690
 and where we are already my favorite movie 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:03.250
 we come to the narrow ridge to this day 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:05.830
 the best you can get I've ever seen 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:09.010
 have terrence malick the for it 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:11.440
 known but also feared is that he 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:13.390
 actor but it costs afterwards 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:15.430
 in the cut from the film does what he does 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:17.290
 want and the narrow ridge is really 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:19.090
 a paradigm example of how to 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:20.500
 for example the fact that mickey rourke 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:21.760
 actually in the film you are playing 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.680
 but probably not seen 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.750
 have the one can only in the elite 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.459
 interest on the dvd see all the scenes with 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:28.870
 I think he has been kicked out of his living room 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:30.220
 they are not really good and 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:32.530
 the most blatant thing a narrow one 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:34.269
 grat is just brody actually the 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:35.650
 should have terrence malick 

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:38.230
 but this is in the cut after 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:39.940
 completely transformed so that then jim 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:41.920
 caviezel was suddenly in focus 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:43.690
 adrien brody runs in the film three times 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:45.430
 wordless through image and that's it then 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:47.260
 even the poor has that 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:49.360
 actually only at the premiere of 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:51.670
 films experience himself while in the cinema 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:53.170
 This is a better fate 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:55.060
 adrien brody also has it in hollywood 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:56.709
 never really made it to great glory 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:57.310
 even the pianist does not have him far 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:02.230
 helped 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:03.790
 he has real luck apparently or if 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:05.049
 you do not care if the galaxy celebrated the same way 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:06.880
 like me then maybe you have 

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:09.730
 also noticed that the space glider 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:11.650
 from steel north milano is called and some 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:13.510
 older or you like to watch series 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:15.190
 they may also know why 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:17.320
 The director James Gunn is a giant 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:18.789
 fan of alyssa milano like yes to 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:22.829
 example in champ played and 

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:22.829
 here was the eponymous saint 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:25.750
 or somehow we just have 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:27.580
 movie classics inside now the fifth 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:30.400
 Element a science fiction classic 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:32.979
 so one of the last choice yet 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:34.300
 Real big sets has used this 

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:36.520
 scenery here, for example, I im 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:38.289
 cinema was very impressive at that time 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:40.120
 was not created on the computer 

00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:41.320
 but was still built by hand 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:43.090
 Here you see how the set in 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:45.039
 miniature size was built so that 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:46.810
 camera can go through fun fact the 

00:04:45.039 --> 00:04:48.760
 Watch the watch on the side of it 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:51.009
 so small is this 

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:53.319
 indeed 

00:04:51.009 --> 00:04:55.059
 the avengers is now one of the 

00:04:53.319 --> 00:04:56.680
 most successful films of all time 

00:04:55.059 --> 00:04:59.169
 I believe in third place of the eternal 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:01.449
 best list he landed only was himself 

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:02.770
 marvel at the origin not at all 

00:05:01.449 --> 00:05:04.300
 sure if the thing really like that 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:06.099
 that's why it was successful 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:07.839
 budget restrictions it was indeed a 

00:05:06.099 --> 00:05:09.249
 big budget available but too 

00:05:07.839 --> 00:05:11.439
 forge the director also had 

00:05:09.249 --> 00:05:12.580
 That is why there were pacific money 

00:05:11.439 --> 00:05:14.289
 example in this scene you 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:16.629
 maybe saw pro tor against 

00:05:14.289 --> 00:05:18.430
 Haie fights for the possibility that sets 

00:05:16.629 --> 00:05:20.559
 either on the computer design or 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:21.969
 a real reason to buy has 

00:05:20.559 --> 00:05:23.800
 the producers just after one 

00:05:21.969 --> 00:05:25.330
 already used film get looked over 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:26.740
 and you have the movie from her 

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:28.509
 found in school is with others 

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:30.460
 schwarzenegger has the jet his first 

00:05:28.509 --> 00:05:33.599
 had his and now his last 

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:42.939
 the hulk has destroyed him too bad 

00:05:33.599 --> 00:05:45.219
 you're fired one of the best things 

00:05:42.939 --> 00:05:47.589
 at the dark knight was always for me 

00:05:45.219 --> 00:05:49.119
 that was never really clear where is coming 

00:05:47.589 --> 00:05:50.770
 because the joker actually does what 

00:05:49.119 --> 00:05:51.939
 he is so crazy and where does he have before all 

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:52.360
 they 'll put the name on his face 

00:05:51.939 --> 00:05:54.099
 here 

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:55.870
 and in fact there are in the script even 

00:05:54.099 --> 00:05:57.729
 no explanation for this christopher nolan 

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:59.589
 but said that he is the joker with 

00:05:57.729 --> 00:06:01.149
 the idea has developed that this one 

00:05:59.589 --> 00:06:02.889
 could be a soldier 

00:06:01.149 --> 00:06:04.990
 the one with a war trauma home 

00:06:02.889 --> 00:06:06.610
 was sent and now apparently the 

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:08.439
 lost mind and now is 

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:09.969
 the a little bit it's such a 

00:06:08.439 --> 00:06:11.680
 fact that where I wish that yourself 

00:06:09.969 --> 00:06:13.629
 I heard myself because I think 

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:15.430
 This mystical joker is so exciting 

00:06:13.629 --> 00:06:19.749
 That's why we just react 

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:21.519
 the pipe we now come to one 

00:06:19.749 --> 00:06:22.990
 would cut into scene namely as 

00:06:21.519 --> 00:06:25.749
 was one of the best of the whole 

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:27.789
 film history as I find an alien 1 

00:06:25.749 --> 00:06:29.529
 There was actually this moment 

00:06:27.789 --> 00:06:31.959
 at the very end probably ripley from the 

00:06:29.529 --> 00:06:33.999
 nostromo wants to escape 15 on captain 

00:06:31.959 --> 00:06:35.199
 dallas is spun and that 

00:06:33.999 --> 00:06:37.149
 is not just stepped in 

00:06:35.199 --> 00:06:39.449
 but he slowly turns into 

00:06:37.149 --> 00:06:39.449
 on 

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:54.840
 and that's how I think 

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:56.460
 maybe one of the most important 

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:57.900
 cut scenes that exist 

00:06:56.460 --> 00:07:00.060
 basically leaves the whole 

00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:01.980
 life cycle of the alien again in one 

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:03.510
 quite different light stand there in part 

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:05.670
 2 we learn yes that's a huge one 

00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:07.500
 alien queen gives the care that 

00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:09.720
 that all reproduce in this one 

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:11.880
 scene but is implied that aliens 

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:13.380
 can also reproduce themselves 

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:16.050
 Apart from that, this scene is 

00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:18.600
 incredibly depressing and almost 

00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:20.400
 disgusting so we really regret that 

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:22.260
 cut it out has one 

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:23.850
 afterwards it explains that the dynamics 

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:25.980
 removed from the escape sequence 

00:07:23.850 --> 00:07:27.210
 would have been but still that would be cool 

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:29.370
 but then would have been 

00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:31.380
 probably not this great 

00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:32.820
 second part with the alien queen 

00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:35.040
 so and now I would like from you 

00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:36.690
 you want to know more of such 

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:38.010
 Sliced ​​scenes give it all there 

00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:40.140
 quite a few in film history 

00:07:38.010 --> 00:07:43.050
 I will be totally thrilling too 

00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:44.760
 the next movie tv as a special 

00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:46.740
 otherwise we'll be back soon 

00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:49.640
 Next I try now movie tobias 

00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:52.020
 to bring every two weeks so he 

00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:53.460
 at last it is quiet because it keeps coming back 

00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:56.660
 but I will ask for it 

00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:56.660
 understand it makes me so also fun
