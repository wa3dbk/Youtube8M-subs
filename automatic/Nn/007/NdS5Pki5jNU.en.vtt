hello there my good friends of YouTube

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:05.289 
hello there my good friends of YouTube
um<00:00:03.260> I'm<00:00:04.129> sharing<00:00:04.549> a<00:00:04.609> few<00:00:04.759> things<00:00:05.029> with<00:00:05.209> you

00:00:05.289 --> 00:00:05.299 
um I'm sharing a few things with you

00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:07.509 
um I'm sharing a few things with you
today<00:00:05.450> I've<00:00:05.930> got<00:00:06.140> this<00:00:06.620> inverter<00:00:07.009> out<00:00:07.279> of<00:00:07.430> a

00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:07.519 
today I've got this inverter out of a

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:10.600 
today I've got this inverter out of a
microwave<00:00:07.879> oven<00:00:07.970> and<00:00:08.420> a<00:00:09.020> another<00:00:09.320> TV<00:00:10.190> board

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:10.610 
microwave oven and a another TV board

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:12.970 
microwave oven and a another TV board
from<00:00:11.000> a<00:00:11.030> 26<00:00:11.510> inch<00:00:11.690> TV<00:00:12.020> these<00:00:12.290> have<00:00:12.500> been<00:00:12.650> given

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:12.980 
from a 26 inch TV these have been given

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:15.580 
from a 26 inch TV these have been given
to<00:00:13.010> me<00:00:13.220> today<00:00:13.930> I'm<00:00:14.930> gonna<00:00:15.050> talk<00:00:15.230> about<00:00:15.440> this

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:15.590 
to me today I'm gonna talk about this

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:17.890 
to me today I'm gonna talk about this
inverter<00:00:16.039> which<00:00:16.430> is<00:00:16.640> the<00:00:16.940> inverter<00:00:17.480> to

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:17.900 
inverter which is the inverter to

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:20.290 
inverter which is the inverter to
replace<00:00:18.620> the<00:00:18.830> traditional<00:00:18.980> iron<00:00:19.670> core<00:00:20.090> high

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:20.300 
replace the traditional iron core high

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.279 
replace the traditional iron core high
voltage<00:00:20.780> transformers<00:00:21.440> which<00:00:21.560> give<00:00:21.770> out<00:00:21.920> 2<00:00:22.160> kV

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:23.289 
voltage transformers which give out 2 kV

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:26.920 
voltage transformers which give out 2 kV
the<00:00:24.289> reason<00:00:24.530> why<00:00:24.619> they've<00:00:25.480> basically<00:00:26.480> this<00:00:26.630> if

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:26.930 
the reason why they've basically this if

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:28.960 
the reason why they've basically this if
this<00:00:27.770> starting<00:00:28.190> to<00:00:28.220> produce<00:00:28.400> these<00:00:28.760> now

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:28.970 
this starting to produce these now

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:30.130 
this starting to produce these now
instead<00:00:29.210> of<00:00:29.270> the<00:00:29.390> iron<00:00:29.539> cause<00:00:29.779> because<00:00:29.990> the

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:30.140 
instead of the iron cause because the

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:33.310 
instead of the iron cause because the
cheaper<00:00:30.650> to<00:00:31.029> 2<00:00:32.029> must<00:00:32.329> produce<00:00:32.539> rather<00:00:32.989> than

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:33.320 
cheaper to 2 must produce rather than

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.319 
cheaper to 2 must produce rather than
the<00:00:33.470> traditional<00:00:34.310> iron<00:00:34.430> core<00:00:34.700> transformers

00:00:35.319 --> 00:00:35.329 
the traditional iron core transformers

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:36.700 
the traditional iron core transformers
which<00:00:35.450> I<00:00:35.570> would<00:00:35.750> prefer<00:00:35.930> to<00:00:36.110> be<00:00:36.380> honest<00:00:36.560> with

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:36.710 
which I would prefer to be honest with

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:40.810 
which I would prefer to be honest with
you<00:00:36.829> and<00:00:37.960> because<00:00:38.960> they're<00:00:39.200> just<00:00:39.980> extremely

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:40.820 
you and because they're just extremely

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:43.540 
you and because they're just extremely
rare<00:00:41.120> there<00:00:41.720> are<00:00:41.780> a<00:00:41.809> lot<00:00:41.930> more<00:00:41.960> robust<00:00:42.559> I<00:00:43.130> think

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:43.550 
rare there are a lot more robust I think

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:46.600 
rare there are a lot more robust I think
you<00:00:44.030> know<00:00:44.149> what<00:00:44.960> they're<00:00:45.829> a<00:00:45.860> lot<00:00:46.040> more<00:00:46.070> deadly

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:46.610 
you know what they're a lot more deadly

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:49.270 
you know what they're a lot more deadly
of<00:00:46.730> course<00:00:47.000> these<00:00:47.390> are<00:00:47.570> a<00:00:47.630> lot<00:00:47.780> more<00:00:48.010> harder<00:00:49.010> to

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:49.280 
of course these are a lot more harder to

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.150 
of course these are a lot more harder to
to<00:00:49.969> get<00:00:50.149> going<00:00:50.420> because<00:00:50.540> you<00:00:50.780> do<00:00:50.899> need<00:00:51.079> us<00:00:51.260> some

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:52.160 
to get going because you do need us some

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.639 
to get going because you do need us some
sort<00:00:52.399> of<00:00:52.610> square<00:00:53.030> wave<00:00:53.270> I<00:00:53.750> think<00:00:53.960> it's<00:00:54.110> I<00:00:54.620> think

00:00:54.639 --> 00:00:54.649 
sort of square wave I think it's I think

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:56.110 
sort of square wave I think it's I think
it's<00:00:54.860> a<00:00:55.010> square<00:00:55.280> wave<00:00:55.460> that<00:00:55.670> you<00:00:55.760> need<00:00:55.910> to

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:56.120 
it's a square wave that you need to

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:57.459 
it's a square wave that you need to
actually<00:00:56.270> start<00:00:56.450> this<00:00:56.930> which<00:00:57.110> is<00:00:57.260> that<00:00:57.290> the

00:00:57.459 --> 00:00:57.469 
actually start this which is that the

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:01.150 
actually start this which is that the
import<00:00:58.219> just<00:00:58.430> there<00:00:59.350> and<00:01:00.350> go<00:01:00.559> back<00:01:00.770> to<00:01:00.950> what's

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:01.160 
import just there and go back to what's

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.020 
import just there and go back to what's
on<00:01:01.250> the<00:01:01.309> board<00:01:01.640> we'll<00:01:02.390> start<00:01:02.660> off<00:01:02.870> a<00:01:02.899> real<00:01:03.320> nice

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:04.030 
on the board we'll start off a real nice

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:08.670 
on the board we'll start off a real nice
wire<00:01:05.030> wound<00:01:05.500> resistor<00:01:06.500> then<00:01:06.890> you've<00:01:07.040> got<00:01:07.250> the

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:08.680 
wire wound resistor then you've got the

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.930 
wire wound resistor then you've got the
rectifier<00:01:09.680> just<00:01:09.979> there<00:01:10.220> which<00:01:10.909> AC<00:01:11.510> to<00:01:11.900> DC<00:01:11.930> and

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:12.940 
rectifier just there which AC to DC and

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:15.520 
rectifier just there which AC to DC and
on<00:01:13.940> the<00:01:14.240> other<00:01:14.540> side<00:01:14.840> of<00:01:14.869> the<00:01:14.990> heatsink<00:01:15.409> you've

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:15.530 
on the other side of the heatsink you've

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:17.679 
on the other side of the heatsink you've
got<00:01:15.710> a<00:01:15.740> nice<00:01:16.070> IGBT<00:01:16.939> I<00:01:17.090> believe<00:01:17.420> these<00:01:17.630> are

00:01:17.679 --> 00:01:17.689 
got a nice IGBT I believe these are

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:20.380 
got a nice IGBT I believe these are
about<00:01:17.990> 1500<00:01:18.470> volts<00:01:19.040> too<00:01:19.250> round<00:01:19.490> about<00:01:19.670> 80<00:01:19.880> amps

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:20.390 
about 1500 volts too round about 80 amps

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:22.810 
about 1500 volts too round about 80 amps
if<00:01:21.140> I<00:01:21.350> remember<00:01:21.740> rightly<00:01:22.040> if<00:01:22.369> it's<00:01:22.580> the<00:01:22.670> one

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:22.820 
if I remember rightly if it's the one

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:26.200 
if I remember rightly if it's the one
that<00:01:23.000> I<00:01:23.030> think<00:01:23.150> is<00:01:23.420> that<00:01:23.659> ends<00:01:23.869> in<00:01:24.200> 3<00:01:24.770> 2<00:01:25.060> is<00:01:26.060> it

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:26.210 
that I think is that ends in 3 2 is it

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:27.730 
that I think is that ends in 3 2 is it
no<00:01:26.420> no<00:01:26.450> no<00:01:26.750> it's<00:01:27.140> something<00:01:27.320> else

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:27.740 
no no no it's something else

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:32.830 
no no no it's something else
I<00:01:27.890> think<00:01:28.369> it's<00:01:28.490> 3<00:01:28.790> 2<00:01:28.970> 1<00:01:29.240> I'm<00:01:29.540> not<00:01:29.720> sure<00:01:31.750> yeah<00:01:32.750> it

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:32.840 
I think it's 3 2 1 I'm not sure yeah it

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:37.020 
I think it's 3 2 1 I'm not sure yeah it
is<00:01:33.020> 3<00:01:33.259> 2<00:01:33.470> 1<00:01:33.820> then<00:01:34.820> if<00:01:35.000> you<00:01:35.090> can<00:01:35.270> just<00:01:35.479> see<00:01:35.689> that

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.030 
is 3 2 1 then if you can just see that

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:40.450 
is 3 2 1 then if you can just see that
about<00:01:38.030> so<00:01:38.299> many<00:01:38.540> of<00:01:38.720> these<00:01:38.869> and<00:01:39.229> you<00:01:40.130> get<00:01:40.250> to

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 
about so many of these and you get to

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:41.950 
about so many of these and you get to
remember<00:01:40.610> what<00:01:40.970> they<00:01:41.090> look<00:01:41.240> like<00:01:41.270> and<00:01:41.659> why

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:41.960 
remember what they look like and why

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:45.280 
remember what they look like and why
they<00:01:42.110> are<00:01:43.600> let's<00:01:44.600> see<00:01:44.720> if<00:01:44.810> we<00:01:44.869> can<00:01:45.020> get<00:01:45.140> that

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:45.290 
they are let's see if we can get that

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:53.330 
they are let's see if we can get that
down<00:01:45.590> there<00:01:45.920> and<00:01:46.430> see<00:01:49.060> your<00:01:50.060> phone

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.569 

and<00:01:54.329> it's<00:01:54.479> not<00:01:54.630> gonna<00:01:54.750> do<00:01:54.930> it<00:01:55.049> is<00:01:55.229> it<00:01:55.490> there<00:01:56.490> you

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
and it's not gonna do it is it there you

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:01.310 
and it's not gonna do it is it there you
go<00:01:56.790> you<00:01:57.420> can<00:01:57.570> just<00:01:57.600> about<00:01:58.079> see<00:01:58.140> that<00:02:00.110> three<00:02:01.110> to

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
go you can just about see that three to

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.950 
go you can just about see that three to
one<00:02:01.530> at<00:02:01.649> the<00:02:01.740> end<00:02:01.860> yes<00:02:02.820> the<00:02:03.119> good<00:02:03.270> are<00:02:03.390> DBT<00:02:03.899> is

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
one at the end yes the good are DBT is

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.370 
one at the end yes the good are DBT is
extremely<00:02:04.770> fast<00:02:04.950> switching<00:02:06.200> and<00:02:07.200> then<00:02:07.320> you

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
extremely fast switching and then you

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:08.990 
extremely fast switching and then you
got<00:02:07.530> another<00:02:07.590> mosfet<00:02:08.190> just<00:02:08.369> there<00:02:08.610> which<00:02:08.849> is

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
got another mosfet just there which is

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.460 
got another mosfet just there which is
this<00:02:09.119> Toshiba<00:02:09.619> gt3<00:02:11.239> 0j<00:02:12.239> three<00:02:12.660> to<00:02:12.959> two

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
this Toshiba gt3 0j three to two

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:14.960 
this Toshiba gt3 0j three to two
that's<00:02:13.920> a<00:02:14.010> fuss<00:02:14.250> switching<00:02:14.580> as<00:02:14.700> what<00:02:14.849> if

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
that's a fuss switching as what if

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.300 
that's a fuss switching as what if
remember<00:02:15.360> only<00:02:15.720> then<00:02:16.709> he<00:02:16.800> got<00:02:16.920> some<00:02:17.099> pretty

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
remember only then he got some pretty

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.080 
remember only then he got some pretty
good<00:02:17.400> capacities<00:02:18.120> them<00:02:19.670> just<00:02:20.670> there<00:02:20.849> these

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
good capacities them just there these

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.140 
good capacities them just there these
ones<00:02:21.360> are<00:02:21.769> that<00:02:22.769> ones<00:02:22.950> 250<00:02:23.610> volts<00:02:23.940> and<00:02:24.030> then

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
ones are that ones 250 volts and then

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.090 
ones are that ones 250 volts and then
you've<00:02:24.239> got<00:02:24.330> the<00:02:24.420> 500<00:02:25.019> and<00:02:25.200> this<00:02:25.290> one's<00:02:25.470> a<00:02:25.560> 500

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
you've got the 500 and this one's a 500

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.630 
you've got the 500 and this one's a 500
as<00:02:26.220> well

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
as well

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.580 
as well
and<00:02:28.519> these<00:02:29.519> ones<00:02:29.700> are<00:02:29.880> 3<00:02:30.150> kV<00:02:30.630> ones<00:02:30.959> these<00:02:31.530> ones

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
and these ones are 3 kV ones these ones

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:37.910 
and these ones are 3 kV ones these ones
here<00:02:32.040> you<00:02:32.880> know<00:02:33.299> 3<00:02:34.230> kV<00:02:34.760> and<00:02:35.760> 3<00:02:36.360> kV<00:02:36.840> and<00:02:37.140> so

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
here you know 3 kV and 3 kV and so

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.940 
here you know 3 kV and 3 kV and so
you've<00:02:38.040> got<00:02:38.450> high<00:02:39.450> voltage<00:02:40.019> diodes<00:02:40.590> which

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
you've got high voltage diodes which

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:44.539 
you've got high voltage diodes which
these<00:02:41.519> are<00:02:42.140> a<00:02:43.140> common<00:02:43.860> what<00:02:43.980> these<00:02:44.099> are<00:02:44.340> now

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:44.549 
these are a common what these are now

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:45.530 
these are a common what these are now
have<00:02:44.700> taught<00:02:44.910> me<00:02:45.030> I<00:02:45.090> don't<00:02:45.239> know<00:02:45.299> they're

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
have taught me I don't know they're

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.420 
have taught me I don't know they're
quite<00:02:46.170> high<00:02:46.440> voltages<00:02:46.890> where<00:02:47.069> they<00:02:47.160> have<00:02:47.250> to

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
quite high voltages where they have to

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.289 
quite high voltages where they have to
be<00:02:47.930> 3000<00:02:48.930> volts<00:02:49.080> plus<00:02:49.349> I<00:02:49.769> love<00:02:50.400> to<00:02:50.580> Google<00:02:51.180> them

00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:51.299 
be 3000 volts plus I love to Google them

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:53.120 
be 3000 volts plus I love to Google them
the<00:02:51.450> part<00:02:51.690> number<00:02:51.959> again<00:02:52.200> and<00:02:52.380> double<00:02:52.830> check

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
the part number again and double check

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:56.570 
the part number again and double check
on<00:02:53.310> that<00:02:54.920> and<00:02:55.920> then<00:02:56.069> of<00:02:56.160> course<00:02:56.220> you've<00:02:56.549> got

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
on that and then of course you've got

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:58.819 
on that and then of course you've got
the<00:02:56.750> flyback<00:02:57.750> transformer<00:02:58.019> which<00:02:58.470> is<00:02:58.650> the

00:02:58.819 --> 00:02:58.829 
the flyback transformer which is the

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:03.860 
the flyback transformer which is the
main<00:03:00.829> part<00:03:01.829> of<00:03:02.010> the<00:03:02.100> board<00:03:02.340> I<00:03:02.579> think<00:03:03.570> it's

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
main part of the board I think it's

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.050 
main part of the board I think it's
around<00:03:03.989> about<00:03:04.350> 30<00:03:04.769> turns<00:03:05.280> I<00:03:05.579> think<00:03:05.790> there<00:03:05.940> is

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
around about 30 turns I think there is

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:10.069 
around about 30 turns I think there is
on<00:03:06.180> here<00:03:06.329> a<00:03:06.950> bit<00:03:07.950> more<00:03:08.160> and<00:03:08.819> then<00:03:09.060> that's<00:03:09.900> the

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:10.079 
on here a bit more and then that's the

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:12.020 
on here a bit more and then that's the
primary<00:03:10.560> of<00:03:10.590> course<00:03:10.920> and<00:03:11.280> then<00:03:11.430> the<00:03:11.549> secondary

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
primary of course and then the secondary

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:15.710 
primary of course and then the secondary
is<00:03:12.390> is<00:03:13.350> under<00:03:13.709> days<00:03:14.150> which<00:03:15.150> is<00:03:15.269> got<00:03:15.450> quite<00:03:15.690> a

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
is is under days which is got quite a

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.539 
is is under days which is got quite a
few<00:03:15.930> number<00:03:16.170> of<00:03:16.290> turns<00:03:16.530> on<00:03:16.769> which<00:03:16.950> I<00:03:17.220> obviously

00:03:17.539 --> 00:03:17.549 
few number of turns on which I obviously

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:20.569 
few number of turns on which I obviously
we<00:03:17.910> wound<00:03:18.239> these<00:03:18.450> myself<00:03:19.019> and<00:03:19.310> put<00:03:20.310> one<00:03:20.459> to

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:20.579 
we wound these myself and put one to

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:23.300 
we wound these myself and put one to
another<00:03:20.760> Flibe<00:03:21.319> another<00:03:22.319> ferrite<00:03:22.680> core<00:03:23.010> and

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
another Flibe another ferrite core and

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:26.090 
another Flibe another ferrite core and
got<00:03:23.940> a<00:03:23.970> pretty<00:03:24.269> decent<00:03:24.769> the<00:03:25.769> flyback

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
got a pretty decent the flyback

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:28.160 
got a pretty decent the flyback
transformer<00:03:26.370> out<00:03:26.790> of<00:03:26.940> them<00:03:27.060> by<00:03:27.630> using<00:03:27.930> the

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
transformer out of them by using the

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:31.190 
transformer out of them by using the
secondary<00:03:28.880> scrap<00:03:29.880> in<00:03:30.030> the<00:03:30.180> primary<00:03:30.780> and<00:03:31.049> just

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 
secondary scrap in the primary and just

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.710 
secondary scrap in the primary and just
using<00:03:31.440> the<00:03:31.530> core<00:03:31.799> the<00:03:32.489> out<00:03:33.030> of<00:03:33.269> just<00:03:33.540> out<00:03:33.690> of

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
using the core the out of just out of

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.080 
using the core the out of just out of
these<00:03:33.989> and<00:03:34.230> put<00:03:34.410> onto<00:03:34.590> another<00:03:35.090> flyback

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
these and put onto another flyback

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:40.699 
these and put onto another flyback
ferrite<00:03:36.870> core<00:03:37.200> so<00:03:38.480> so<00:03:39.480> yeah<00:03:39.660> there's<00:03:39.930> a<00:03:40.019> some

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:40.709 
ferrite core so so yeah there's a some

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:42.860 
ferrite core so so yeah there's a some
pretty<00:03:40.889> useful<00:03:41.130> parts<00:03:41.760> these<00:03:42.060> heatsink<00:03:42.720> so

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
pretty useful parts these heatsink so

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:45.289 
pretty useful parts these heatsink so
good<00:03:43.019> for<00:03:43.200> making<00:03:43.350> CBS<00:03:43.920> drivers<00:03:44.430> you<00:03:45.180> know

00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:45.299 
good for making CBS drivers you know

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:47.780 
good for making CBS drivers you know
Chris<00:03:45.510> is<00:03:45.690> quite<00:03:46.590> a<00:03:46.620> number<00:03:46.769> of<00:03:46.920> em<00:03:47.220> holes<00:03:47.549> on

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
Chris is quite a number of em holes on

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:49.340 
Chris is quite a number of em holes on
them<00:03:47.910> so<00:03:48.090> you<00:03:48.180> can<00:03:48.299> get<00:03:48.450> some<00:03:48.660> good<00:03:48.780> MOSFETs<00:03:49.170> on

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:49.350 
them so you can get some good MOSFETs on

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:52.250 
them so you can get some good MOSFETs on
there<00:03:49.560> and<00:03:49.859> you<00:03:50.790> can<00:03:50.940> use<00:03:51.000> a<00:03:51.209> load<00:03:51.630> of<00:03:51.780> these<00:03:51.959> to

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
there and you can use a load of these to

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.979 
there and you can use a load of these to
make<00:03:52.430> some<00:03:53.430> sort<00:03:53.609> of<00:03:53.790> capacitor<00:03:54.569> bank<00:03:54.780> will

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:54.989 
make some sort of capacitor bank will

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:59.539 
make some sort of capacitor bank will
archive<00:03:55.350> them<00:03:55.650> to<00:03:56.540> to<00:03:57.540> run<00:03:57.780> that<00:03:58.019> little<00:03:58.549> Tesla

00:03:59.539 --> 00:03:59.549 
archive them to to run that little Tesla

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:02.649 
archive them to to run that little Tesla
coil<00:03:59.880> just<00:04:00.030> there<00:04:00.329> that<00:04:01.109> certain<00:04:01.620> tells

00:04:02.649 --> 00:04:02.659 
coil just there that certain tells

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:05.560 
coil just there that certain tells
absolute<00:04:03.659> load<00:04:04.019> of<00:04:04.170> these

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:05.570 
absolute load of these

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:10.550 
absolute load of these
in<00:04:06.570> series<00:04:07.760> so<00:04:08.760> so<00:04:09.540> that's<00:04:09.690> that<00:04:09.900> which<00:04:10.350> is

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 
in series so so that's that which is

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:13.160 
in series so so that's that which is
pretty<00:04:11.130> cool<00:04:11.400> it's<00:04:12.180> a<00:04:12.270> nice<00:04:12.480> good<00:04:12.690> parts<00:04:13.050> off

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:13.170 
pretty cool it's a nice good parts off

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:16.100 
pretty cool it's a nice good parts off
these<00:04:13.380> so<00:04:14.070> yeah<00:04:14.250> if<00:04:14.400> you<00:04:15.090> can<00:04:15.240> get<00:04:15.390> older<00:04:15.660> one

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:16.110 
these so yeah if you can get older one

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:18.410 
these so yeah if you can get older one
of<00:04:16.200> these<00:04:16.320> they're<00:04:16.620> the<00:04:17.220> good<00:04:17.370> for<00:04:17.670> many<00:04:18.209> many

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:18.420 
of these they're the good for many many

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:23.360 
of these they're the good for many many
parts<00:04:19.700> so<00:04:20.700> and<00:04:21.180> then<00:04:21.330> I've<00:04:21.450> got<00:04:21.600> this<00:04:21.920> TV<00:04:22.920> board

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:23.370 
parts so and then I've got this TV board

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:26.450 
parts so and then I've got this TV board
which<00:04:23.580> is<00:04:23.730> out<00:04:23.850> of<00:04:23.880> a<00:04:24.000> 26<00:04:24.510> inch<00:04:24.750> I<00:04:25.250> think<00:04:26.250> it<00:04:26.370> was

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:26.460 
which is out of a 26 inch I think it was

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:30.160 
which is out of a 26 inch I think it was
a<00:04:26.490> philips<00:04:27.090> television<00:04:27.600> if<00:04:27.690> I<00:04:27.780> remember<00:04:28.110> Arnie

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:30.170 
a philips television if I remember Arnie

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:33.530 
a philips television if I remember Arnie
very<00:04:31.170> nice<00:04:31.320> fly<00:04:31.920> back<00:04:32.160> just<00:04:32.400> there<00:04:32.640> it's<00:04:33.420> quite

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:33.540 
very nice fly back just there it's quite

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:36.380 
very nice fly back just there it's quite
quite<00:04:34.230> a<00:04:34.260> nice<00:04:34.500> one<00:04:34.710> nice<00:04:34.830> quite<00:04:35.160> big<00:04:35.400> and<00:04:36.120> then

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:36.390 
quite a nice one nice quite big and then

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:39.620 
quite a nice one nice quite big and then
you've<00:04:36.540> got<00:04:36.830> lots<00:04:37.830> and<00:04:38.220> lots<00:04:38.430> of<00:04:38.670> goodies<00:04:39.030> on

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:39.630 
you've got lots and lots of goodies on

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:43.270 
you've got lots and lots of goodies on
them<00:04:39.810> as<00:04:40.290> well<00:04:40.500> the<00:04:41.130> wire<00:04:41.700> and<00:04:41.940> ceramic

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:43.280 
them as well the wire and ceramic

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:48.010 
them as well the wire and ceramic
resistor<00:04:45.320> and<00:04:46.320> this<00:04:46.710> is<00:04:46.890> the<00:04:47.010> important

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:48.020 
resistor and this is the important

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:50.840 
resistor and this is the important
instead<00:04:49.020> of<00:04:49.110> using<00:04:49.260> a<00:04:49.440> rectifier<00:04:49.950> I<00:04:50.190> have<00:04:50.580> seen

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:50.850 
instead of using a rectifier I have seen

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:53.240 
instead of using a rectifier I have seen
some<00:04:51.420> rectifiers<00:04:51.930> on<00:04:52.110> some<00:04:52.350> TVs<00:04:52.770> it<00:04:52.950> depends

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:53.250 
some rectifiers on some TVs it depends

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:55.370 
some rectifiers on some TVs it depends
if<00:04:53.430> it's<00:04:53.610> a<00:04:53.820> pretty<00:04:54.540> decent<00:04:54.960> board

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:55.380 
if it's a pretty decent board

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:58.550 
if it's a pretty decent board
they<00:04:56.130> were<00:04:56.220> usually<00:04:56.430> user<00:04:57.300> the<00:04:57.960> rectifier

00:04:58.550 --> 00:04:58.560 
they were usually user the rectifier

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:01.130 
they were usually user the rectifier
because<00:04:58.890> it's<00:04:59.640> cheaper<00:04:59.970> to<00:05:00.000> buy<00:05:00.240> these<00:05:00.300> then

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:01.140 
because it's cheaper to buy these then

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:04.610 
because it's cheaper to buy these then
it<00:05:01.260> is<00:05:01.410> cheaper<00:05:01.980> to<00:05:02.010> buy<00:05:02.280> one<00:05:02.490> of<00:05:02.520> those<00:05:03.620> you

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:04.620 
it is cheaper to buy one of those you

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:05.810 
it is cheaper to buy one of those you
wouldn't<00:05:04.770> think<00:05:04.950> it<00:05:05.100> would<00:05:05.250> be<00:05:05.400> really<00:05:05.550> would

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:05.820 
wouldn't think it would be really would

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:08.450 
wouldn't think it would be really would
you<00:05:06.000> well<00:05:06.690> yeah<00:05:06.840> this<00:05:07.050> lots<00:05:07.980> and<00:05:08.190> lots<00:05:08.310> of

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:08.460 
you well yeah this lots and lots of

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:11.030 
you well yeah this lots and lots of
parts<00:05:08.790> some<00:05:09.750> good<00:05:09.900> useful<00:05:10.110> parts<00:05:10.650> to<00:05:10.800> use

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:11.040 
parts some good useful parts to use

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:14.980 
parts some good useful parts to use
because<00:05:11.670> there's<00:05:11.880> lovely<00:05:12.180> big<00:05:12.360> thick<00:05:12.600> diodes

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:14.990 
because there's lovely big thick diodes

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:18.590 
because there's lovely big thick diodes
see<00:05:15.990> loads<00:05:16.470> of<00:05:16.620> those<00:05:17.460> are<00:05:17.670> nice<00:05:17.850> heat<00:05:18.150> sinks

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:18.600 
see loads of those are nice heat sinks

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:22.130 
see loads of those are nice heat sinks
to<00:05:18.810> to<00:05:19.380> make<00:05:20.240> projects<00:05:21.240> up<00:05:21.450> to<00:05:21.840> make<00:05:21.960> some

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:22.140 
to to make projects up to make some

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:27.950 
to to make projects up to make some
circuit<00:05:22.620> so<00:05:25.190> nice<00:05:26.190> and<00:05:26.490> dr.<00:05:26.910> nice<00:05:27.540> ferrite

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:27.960 
circuit so nice and dr. nice ferrite

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:35.510 
circuit so nice and dr. nice ferrite
core<00:05:33.890> so<00:05:34.890> there<00:05:35.040> you<00:05:35.100> go<00:05:35.220> guys

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:35.520 
core so there you go guys

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:39.800 
core so there you go guys
I<00:05:35.820> thought<00:05:36.360> I'd<00:05:36.570> share<00:05:36.810> that<00:05:36.990> with<00:05:37.140> you<00:05:38.810> see

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:39.810 
I thought I'd share that with you see

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:42.950 
I thought I'd share that with you see
this<00:05:40.410> these<00:05:41.250> are<00:05:41.460> what<00:05:41.550> I've<00:05:41.670> taken<00:05:41.910> off<00:05:42.150> the

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:42.960 
this these are what I've taken off the

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:45.890 
this these are what I've taken off the
parts<00:05:43.440> of<00:05:43.590> the<00:05:43.970> microwave<00:05:44.970> oven<00:05:45.240> transformer

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:45.900 
parts of the microwave oven transformer

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:49.190 
parts of the microwave oven transformer
and<00:05:46.880> this<00:05:47.880> was<00:05:48.060> off<00:05:48.180> the<00:05:48.300> microwave<00:05:48.690> off<00:05:48.960> the

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:49.200 
and this was off the microwave off the

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:52.580 
and this was off the microwave off the
behind<00:05:50.130> the<00:05:50.430> display<00:05:50.910> and<00:05:51.360> so<00:05:52.140> that<00:05:52.260> was<00:05:52.410> off

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:52.590 
behind the display and so that was off

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:57.860 
behind the display and so that was off
the<00:05:53.990> import<00:05:54.990> of<00:05:55.260> the<00:05:55.380> microwave<00:05:55.890> and<00:05:56.690> that<00:05:57.690> was

00:05:57.860 --> 00:05:57.870 
the import of the microwave and that was

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:00.950 
the import of the microwave and that was
off<00:05:58.200> the<00:05:58.260> power<00:05:58.650> supply<00:05:58.830> side<00:05:59.610> of<00:05:59.910> this<00:06:00.120> board

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:00.960 
off the power supply side of this board

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:03.200 
off the power supply side of this board
because<00:06:01.860> there<00:06:02.070> was<00:06:02.160> another<00:06:02.340> part<00:06:02.700> there's

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:03.210 
because there was another part there's

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:05.180 
because there was another part there's
another<00:06:03.420> part<00:06:03.720> which<00:06:03.870> the<00:06:04.110> mains<00:06:04.500> came<00:06:04.770> in<00:06:04.980> and

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:05.190 
another part which the mains came in and

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:07.220 
another part which the mains came in and
then<00:06:05.640> it<00:06:05.790> went<00:06:06.120> through<00:06:06.240> a<00:06:06.450> filter<00:06:06.990> and<00:06:07.020> then

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:07.230 
then it went through a filter and then

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:09.620 
then it went through a filter and then
into<00:06:07.650> this<00:06:07.740> board<00:06:08.040> and<00:06:08.310> that's<00:06:09.210> what<00:06:09.420> I<00:06:09.450> had

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:09.630 
into this board and that's what I had

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:11.480 
into this board and that's what I had
off<00:06:09.780> it<00:06:09.960> in<00:06:10.080> a<00:06:10.170> couple<00:06:10.440> of<00:06:10.500> caps<00:06:10.770> just<00:06:10.890> inside

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:11.490 
off it in a couple of caps just inside

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:14.810 
off it in a couple of caps just inside
there<00:06:11.820> as<00:06:12.000> well<00:06:12.210> and<00:06:12.540> of<00:06:13.260> course<00:06:13.580> some<00:06:14.580> of<00:06:14.669> the

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:14.820 
there as well and of course some of the

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:16.660 
there as well and of course some of the
filter

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:16.670 
filter

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:18.580 
filter
crack<00:06:16.850> of<00:06:17.000> ballast<00:06:17.420> the<00:06:17.630> way<00:06:17.840> it<00:06:17.990> was<00:06:18.110> wired<00:06:18.380> up

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:18.590 
crack of ballast the way it was wired up

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:24.480 
crack of ballast the way it was wired up
to<00:06:18.650> be<00:06:18.920> honest<00:06:22.060> some<00:06:23.060> sort<00:06:23.300> of<00:06:23.420> filter<00:06:23.690> anyway

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:24.490 
to be honest some sort of filter anyway

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:28.120 
to be honest some sort of filter anyway
so<00:06:25.840> thought<00:06:26.840> to<00:06:26.960> share<00:06:27.140> that<00:06:27.290> with<00:06:27.410> you<00:06:27.470> yes
