00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
be very careful when you're reaching

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.400 
be very careful when you're reaching
your<00:02:51.700> hands<00:02:52.000> in<00:02:52.209> there<00:02:52.360> it<00:02:52.629> looks<00:02:53.050> to<00:02:53.230> me<00:02:53.379> like

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:53.410 
your hands in there it looks to me like

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:56.490 
your hands in there it looks to me like
it<00:02:53.739> could<00:02:53.920> use<00:02:54.099> just<00:02:54.129> a<00:02:54.610> little<00:02:55.030> bit<00:02:55.269> more<00:02:55.660> you

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
it could use just a little bit more you

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:57.990 
it could use just a little bit more you
can<00:02:56.709> see<00:02:56.950> here<00:02:57.160> that<00:02:57.280> it's<00:02:57.430> starting<00:02:57.700> to<00:02:57.790> stick

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 
can see here that it's starting to stick

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.420 
can see here that it's starting to stick
together<00:02:58.180> but<00:02:58.569> I've<00:02:58.989> got<00:02:59.379> a<00:02:59.410> little<00:02:59.890> bit<00:03:00.099> too

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
together but I've got a little bit too

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:02.820 
together but I've got a little bit too
much<00:03:00.640> crumble<00:03:01.360> still<00:03:01.750> in<00:03:01.959> there<00:03:02.200> so<00:03:02.500> I'm<00:03:02.620> going

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:02.830 
much crumble still in there so I'm going

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:04.860 
much crumble still in there so I'm going
to<00:03:02.890> see<00:03:03.099> if<00:03:03.190> we<00:03:03.310> can<00:03:03.459> get<00:03:03.610> it<00:03:03.730> to<00:03:04.330> blend<00:03:04.690> a

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:04.870 
to see if we can get it to blend a

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:15.050 
to see if we can get it to blend a
little<00:03:05.140> bit<00:03:05.290> more

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:18.440 

and<00:03:15.840> I<00:03:16.140> think<00:03:16.380> that's<00:03:16.590> about<00:03:16.890> all<00:03:17.190> we<00:03:18.060> can<00:03:18.209> hope

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
and I think that's about all we can hope

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:21.530 
and I think that's about all we can hope
for<00:03:18.510> so<00:03:19.050> we're<00:03:19.230> going<00:03:19.380> to<00:03:19.470> just<00:03:19.890> now<00:03:20.390> remove<00:03:21.390> it

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
for so we're going to just now remove it

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:24.260 
for so we're going to just now remove it
from<00:03:21.660> the<00:03:21.840> food<00:03:22.020> processor<00:03:22.800> and<00:03:23.000> put<00:03:24.000> it<00:03:24.120> in<00:03:24.209> a

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:24.270 
from the food processor and put it in a

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:28.340 
from the food processor and put it in a
bowl<00:03:25.550> it's<00:03:26.550> like<00:03:26.730> this<00:03:27.090> you<00:03:27.780> can<00:03:27.959> see<00:03:28.140> that

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
bowl it's like this you can see that

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:31.660 
bowl it's like this you can see that
wants<00:03:28.860> to<00:03:29.010> form<00:03:29.280> its<00:03:29.459> own<00:03:29.610> big<00:03:30.000> fat<00:03:30.330> cookie

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:31.670 
wants to form its own big fat cookie

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:35.780 
wants to form its own big fat cookie
there<00:03:32.670> we<00:03:32.850> have<00:03:33.090> it<00:03:33.950> all<00:03:34.950> that<00:03:35.010> goodness<00:03:35.489> out

there we have it all that goodness out
of<00:03:35.940> there<00:03:37.010> and<00:03:38.010> now<00:03:38.910> I'm<00:03:39.390> going<00:03:39.660> to<00:03:39.750> toss<00:03:40.200> in

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
move that into the center a little bit I

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:55.550 
move that into the center a little bit I
don't<00:03:52.860> have<00:03:53.070> to<00:03:53.340> massage<00:03:54.060> it<00:03:54.570> too<00:03:54.930> much<00:03:55.170> or

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.810 
I'm going to put the mixture on a pair

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:11.509 
I'm going to put the mixture on a pair
of<00:04:09.840> flex<00:04:10.170> sheet<00:04:10.560> now<00:04:10.800> this<00:04:10.980> pair<00:04:11.220> of<00:04:11.310> flex

00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:11.519 
of flex sheet now this pair of flex

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:12.979 
of flex sheet now this pair of flex
sheet<00:04:11.760> is<00:04:11.910> the<00:04:12.060> type<00:04:12.269> that<00:04:12.450> you<00:04:12.540> have<00:04:12.750> in<00:04:12.870> your

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:18.170 
sheet is the type that you have in your
xcalibur<00:04:13.440> dehydrator<00:04:16.880> I'm<00:04:17.880> going<00:04:18.120> to

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:25.250 
here you can see that I can mix it a
little<00:04:23.130> bit<00:04:23.700> more<00:04:23.850> easily<00:04:24.330> here<00:04:24.750> than<00:04:24.930> I<00:04:25.020> can

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:25.260 
little bit more easily here than I can

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:32.029 
little bit more easily here than I can
in<00:04:25.410> a<00:04:25.500> bowl<00:04:26.300> just<00:04:27.300> like<00:04:27.419> that<00:04:29.330> and<00:04:30.800> I'm<00:04:31.800> going

what<00:05:11.040> I'm<00:05:11.160> going<00:05:11.310> to<00:05:11.400> do<00:05:11.580> is<00:05:11.730> I'm<00:05:11.850> going<00:05:11.880> to<00:05:12.090> cut

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:12.270 
what I'm going to do is I'm going to cut

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:16.930 
what I'm going to do is I'm going to cut
about<00:05:12.300> half<00:05:12.780> inch<00:05:13.080> slices<00:05:13.290> just<00:05:14.190> like<00:05:14.400> this

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:16.940 

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:19.850 

just<00:05:17.940> the<00:05:18.480> reason<00:05:18.840> that<00:05:18.960> I<00:05:19.050> cut<00:05:19.290> it<00:05:19.380> into<00:05:19.530> that

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:19.860 
just the reason that I cut it into that

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:22.640 
just the reason that I cut it into that
I<00:05:19.890> form<00:05:20.250> it<00:05:20.370> into<00:05:20.580> a<00:05:20.610> log<00:05:20.910> first<00:05:21.450> is<00:05:21.780> so<00:05:22.380> that<00:05:22.620> I

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:22.650 
I form it into a log first is so that I

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:25.970 
I form it into a log first is so that I
can<00:05:22.770> portion<00:05:23.400> it<00:05:23.670> well<00:05:24.170> so<00:05:25.170> that<00:05:25.200> each<00:05:25.620> piece

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:25.980 
can portion it well so that each piece

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:29.180 
can portion it well so that each piece
is<00:05:26.310> more<00:05:26.550> or<00:05:26.700> less<00:05:26.880> the<00:05:27.090> same<00:05:27.330> size<00:05:27.920> so<00:05:28.920> if<00:05:29.070> I

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:29.190 
is more or less the same size so if I

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:31.880 
is more or less the same size so if I
were<00:05:29.310> to<00:05:29.400> take<00:05:29.640> this<00:05:29.910> now<00:05:30.270> I'd<00:05:30.990> have<00:05:31.410> the<00:05:31.680> right

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:31.890 
were to take this now I'd have the right

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:35.630 
were to take this now I'd have the right
size<00:05:32.280> and<00:05:32.760> roll<00:05:33.570> it<00:05:33.690> into<00:05:33.840> a<00:05:33.930> ball<00:05:33.990> so<00:05:34.560> now<00:05:35.430> what

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:35.640 
size and roll it into a ball so now what

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:38.060 
size and roll it into a ball so now what
I<00:05:35.670> can<00:05:35.790> do<00:05:36.150> is<00:05:36.330> just<00:05:36.600> flatten<00:05:37.020> them<00:05:37.110> out<00:05:37.230> with

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:38.070 
I can do is just flatten them out with

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:41.300 
I can do is just flatten them out with
