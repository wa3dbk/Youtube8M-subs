from the other video so what you'll need

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.310 
from the other video so what you'll need
is<00:00:08.849> glass<00:00:09.330> a<00:00:11.360> lithium<00:00:12.360> battery<00:00:12.389> must<00:00:13.170> be

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
is glass a lithium battery must be

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.500 
is glass a lithium battery must be
lithium<00:00:14.660> some<00:00:15.660> needle<00:00:16.350> nose<00:00:16.379> pliers<00:00:16.920> and<00:00:17.609> an

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
lithium some needle nose pliers and an

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:25.220 
lithium some needle nose pliers and an
airtight<00:00:19.020> container<00:00:21.980> so<00:00:23.269> okay<00:00:24.269> we're<00:00:24.449> back<00:00:24.600> so

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
airtight container so okay we're back so

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:26.900 
airtight container so okay we're back so
you<00:00:25.289> need<00:00:25.560> to<00:00:25.680> get<00:00:25.800> the<00:00:25.949> plastic<00:00:26.279> off<00:00:26.699> the

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
you need to get the plastic off the

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.240 
you need to get the plastic off the
battery<00:00:27.529> these<00:00:28.529> batteries<00:00:28.859> are<00:00:28.949> easier<00:00:29.220> to

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
battery these batteries are easier to

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.769 
battery these batteries are easier to
short<00:00:29.519> out<00:00:29.640> so<00:00:30.000> if<00:00:30.060> it<00:00:30.179> starts<00:00:30.449> heating<00:00:30.570> up

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
short out so if it starts heating up

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.240 
short out so if it starts heating up
throw<00:00:31.050> it<00:00:31.080> away<00:00:31.199> before<00:00:31.470> some<00:00:31.679> start<00:00:31.890> venting

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
throw it away before some start venting

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.340 
throw it away before some start venting
fumes<00:00:32.750> and<00:00:33.750> we'll<00:00:34.350> be<00:00:34.469> back<00:00:34.649> can<00:00:34.680> we<00:00:34.980> do<00:00:35.100> that

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:36.350 
fumes and we'll be back can we do that

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:38.900 
fumes and we'll be back can we do that
we're<00:00:37.350> back<00:00:37.559> and<00:00:37.860> so<00:00:38.190> now<00:00:38.340> what<00:00:38.579> you<00:00:38.670> want<00:00:38.850> to

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
do we've got plastic off and now just

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:48.889 
do we've got plastic off and now just
pop<00:00:42.629> off<00:00:42.739> this<00:00:43.739> part<00:00:44.010> with<00:00:44.160> the<00:00:44.219> pliers<00:00:47.899> bit

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
pop off this part with the pliers bit

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:54.529 
pop off this part with the pliers bit
off<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.140> top<00:00:52.100> yeah<00:00:53.100> that's<00:00:53.430> bit<00:00:53.610> there<00:00:53.820> okay

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
off the top yeah that's bit there okay

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:55.939

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
and we'll be back and we do that because

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.959 
and we'll be back and we do that because
it's<00:00:56.250> a<00:00:56.309> bit<00:00:56.460> harder<00:00:58.070> um<00:00:59.070> so<00:00:59.399> now<00:00:59.579> we've<00:00:59.760> done

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
it's a bit harder um so now we've done

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.029 
it's a bit harder um so now we've done
pulled<00:01:00.510> off<00:01:00.629> the<00:01:00.750> metal<00:01:01.020> bit<00:01:01.170> it<00:01:01.410> might<00:01:01.680> take<00:01:02.010> a

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
pulled off the metal bit it might take a

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.719 
pulled off the metal bit it might take a
little<00:01:02.219> bit<00:01:02.520> of<00:01:02.609> time<00:01:02.850> but<00:01:03.090> we've<00:01:03.300> done<00:01:03.449> it<00:01:03.629> and

00:01:04.719 --> 00:01:04.729 
little bit of time but we've done it and

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:07.250 
little bit of time but we've done it and
now<00:01:05.729> what<00:01:05.880> you<00:01:06.000> want<00:01:06.150> to<00:01:06.240> do<00:01:06.360> is<00:01:06.659> peel<00:01:06.930> off<00:01:07.080> the

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
now what you want to do is peel off the

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.219 
now what you want to do is peel off the
outer<00:01:07.409> metal<00:01:07.860> JAF<00:01:08.189> it<00:01:08.369> off<00:01:08.460> of<00:01:08.549> it<00:01:08.670> so<00:01:09.229> they're

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
outer metal JAF it off of it so they're

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.950 
outer metal JAF it off of it so they're
out<00:01:10.380> a<00:01:10.409> little<00:01:10.770> bit<00:01:10.950> and<00:01:11.510> then<00:01:12.510> we<00:01:12.630> back<00:01:12.810> when

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
out a little bit and then we back when

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.520 
out a little bit and then we back when
we<00:01:13.049> do<00:01:13.170> that<00:01:13.409> and<00:01:15.020> what<00:01:16.020> you<00:01:16.080> have<00:01:16.200> to<00:01:16.259> do<00:01:16.409> is

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
we do that and what you have to do is

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.660 
we do that and what you have to do is
pull<00:01:16.799> out<00:01:16.830> pull<00:01:17.700> out<00:01:17.790> the<00:01:19.130> course<00:01:20.130> slightly

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
pull out pull out the course slightly

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.460 
pull out pull out the course slightly
and<00:01:20.820> unravel<00:01:21.330> it<00:01:21.450> and<00:01:21.659> there's<00:01:22.020> your<00:01:22.200> with<00:01:22.320> DA

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
and unravel it and there's your with DA

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.679 
and unravel it and there's your with DA
metal<00:01:22.830> club<00:01:23.430> we<00:01:23.549> put<00:01:23.790> it<00:01:23.909> in<00:01:24.090> the<00:01:24.299> container

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
metal club we put it in the container

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:30.740 
metal club we put it in the container
and<00:01:25.610> simply<00:01:26.610> like<00:01:28.490> close<00:01:29.490> the<00:01:29.670> lid<00:01:29.909> so<00:01:30.600> you

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
and simply like close the lid so you

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:39.569 
and simply like close the lid so you
have<00:01:30.840> more<00:01:31.470> time<00:01:31.530> later

00:01:39.569 --> 00:01:39.579 

00:01:39.579 --> 00:01:42.370 

and<00:01:40.579> what<00:01:40.909> you<00:01:40.969> have<00:01:41.060> to<00:01:41.180> do<00:01:41.299> is<00:01:41.420> pull<00:01:41.659> out<00:01:41.810> the

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:42.380 
and what you have to do is pull out the

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.520 
and what you have to do is pull out the
lithium<00:01:42.770> battery<00:01:43.039> from<00:01:43.250> the<00:01:43.310> core<00:01:43.610> there<00:01:44.030> and

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:44.530 
lithium battery from the core there and

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:47.859 
lithium battery from the core there and
then<00:01:45.530> you<00:01:45.679> have<00:01:45.799> to<00:01:46.039> grab<00:01:46.399> that<00:01:46.670> white<00:01:47.329> bit<00:01:47.570> and

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:47.869 
then you have to grab that white bit and

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:50.859 
then you have to grab that white bit and
unravel<00:01:48.380> it<00:01:48.619> and<00:01:48.979> take<00:01:49.189> out<00:01:49.310> with<00:01:49.520> lithium<00:01:50.060> the

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:50.869 
unravel it and take out with lithium the

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:52.870 
unravel it and take out with lithium the
core<00:01:51.079> bits<00:01:51.289> the<00:01:51.770> metal<00:01:52.009> spin<00:01:52.219> and<00:01:52.520> see<00:01:52.670> there

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:52.880 
core bits the metal spin and see there

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:59.440 
core bits the metal spin and see there
and<00:01:54.670> then<00:01:55.670> quickly<00:01:56.060> put<00:01:56.360> it<00:01:56.390> away<00:01:58.149> quickly<00:01:59.149> so

00:01:59.440 --> 00:01:59.450 
and then quickly put it away quickly so

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.260 
and then quickly put it away quickly so
you<00:01:59.869> can<00:01:59.990> get<00:02:00.140> the<00:02:00.259> oxidization<00:02:01.119> you're<00:02:02.119> gonna

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270 
you can get the oxidization you're gonna

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.160 
you can get the oxidization you're gonna
get<00:02:02.360> oxidization<00:02:03.140> right<00:02:03.289> and<00:02:04.780> yeah<00:02:05.780> that's

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.170 
get oxidization right and yeah that's

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:07.990 
get oxidization right and yeah that's
the<00:02:06.289> diamond<00:02:06.649> and<00:02:06.770> then<00:02:06.979> you<00:02:07.579> can<00:02:07.759> light<00:02:07.969> it

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 
the diamond and then you can light it

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.359 
the diamond and then you can light it
later<00:02:08.330> and<00:02:08.629> look<00:02:09.049> in<00:02:09.170> our<00:02:09.319> other<00:02:09.470> video<00:02:09.799> how<00:02:10.190> we
