00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.159
 how is the arrangement of the maltese bichon 

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:11.380
 one of the most common races we have 

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:13.090
 at home as a pet are the chicks 

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:15.010
 maltese because it is a dog that adapts 

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:16.510
 very well to life inside house the 

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:18.640
 family life as we have brought 

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:20.640
 amaury that everyone already knows him so that 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:24.340
 explain what are the care 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.329
 specific and cut the arrangement that 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:28.270
 has exposure 

00:00:25.329 --> 00:00:30.340
 the Maltese bug so mauri yes 

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:32.439
 nothing again we are here with this 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:34.030
 race and how I had told you 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:39.399
 previously like all races of 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:43.690
 straight hair and long we use almost the same 

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:45.010
 I want to emphasize first of all the one 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:47.579
 little of the head arrangement that does not 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:50.769
 we have talked a lot and especially the 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.940
 fix in a person in calcium in case 

00:00:50.769 --> 00:00:53.559
 that he does not want to have it for the 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:55.269
 exhibition an arrangement rather eat 

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:56.949
 at home and also at home so that they 

00:00:55.269 --> 00:00:59.530
 can do a little thing that calls me the 

00:00:56.949 --> 00:01:01.659
 attention for fact of being white uses 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:05.290
 is some product for white dog yes 

00:01:01.659 --> 00:01:07.770
 as we do not have a little bit of products that 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:09.550
 they are whiteners we have shampoos 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.730
 coincidentally in the brand but we have 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:14.740
 whitening shampoo and we have 

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:17.680
 especially for those for the lacrimal 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:19.480
 the puppies that is always accurate 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:23.740
 we have a little with this same product 

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:25.570
 with a cotton swab or cotton swab 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:27.940
 puts in these areas here that tears 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:30.370
 a lot if they are stained so that it whitens 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:32.500
 apart from other compound small rasta 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:34.390
 that is usually done here in the 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.340
 lacrimal as the solutions that makes 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:39.040
 that hair cut or give no no no never 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:41.980
 never in the case of exposure is it ever 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:43.720
 cuts trying never to cut hair 

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:45.850
 of an exhibition dog a maltese joe 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:48.160
 side sheets there were also other races 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:50.350
 Similar is always treated 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:51.910
 when saving all this hair is worth it is put 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:53.680
 conditioner in case you have very 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:55.780
 united the harrow and it starts to open with 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:57.670
 the fingers until getting all the short 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:59.470
 of hair starts to fall and people 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:01.390
 people at home the basics that is what 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:04.120
 need they would have to brush in 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:05.710
 principle need I think it will be the the 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:07.630
 brush not talking about butter 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:09.490
 exactly I advise a person 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:10.899
 that you have at home and do not have the 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:12.820
 possibility of taking him to a hairdresser 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:15.250
 and at least I should have a 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:17.080
 moisturizing conditioner is worth a 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:18.640
 moisturizing shampoo usually from the 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.720
 same brand because they have generally 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.110
 the products 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.520
 similar and have a brush that 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:26.410
 We have a lot of quality in Latin but 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:27.940
 also that a letter is very soft 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:30.100
 similar to this one that is also very 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:33.040
 soft that would be used after the brush 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:35.170
 and in the end a comb that only 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.180
 for finishing and combing aria for 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:38.980
 finish the dog and keep it and 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:42.400
 correct for example when there is a 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:45.010
 knot the passing of the comb is locked but still 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:48.160
 as a rectifier is perfect very 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:51.280
 Well, nothing to put with him and we see how 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:52.870
 you leave it in the after good guys 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:55.870
 as our friend told us 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:58.130
 amaury then I with my little brush give him that 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:01.530
 I hit the Maltese bichon 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:05.030
 that the truth is I'm leaving 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:08.990
 of exposition 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:12.050
 what do you think about it but good 

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:15.560
 but what's done with it but this is 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:19.790
 a chicken because we have the bug in 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:21.890
 been really good all races 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:23.930
 who will be exposed or taken to 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:25.250
 a hairdresser should be tied for a 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:26.660
 security problem the dog is 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:28.640
 could fall off the table can be done 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:29.810
 an injury but above all it is also 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:32.300
 so that the dog knows that it is 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:33.860
 controlled because if we're working 

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:35.300
 with scissors or some tool that 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:37.910
 can be constant and the dog is 

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:39.410
 move could cause a wound yes 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:42.500
 it is true that he tells us that 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:45.560
 I was two years old I do not know and good vision 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:49.760
 in difference to lyon saint kitts or others 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:54.230
 races the Maltese are caught 22 bombs 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:56.510
 here it is worth then this is first I 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:59.930
 I do this way it takes a bit with 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:02.120
 the comb what would be the inside of the 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:03.800
 pump so that the hair takes a bit of 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:05.660
 body and why the tables do not move 

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:08.720
 Maybe not, it's not just a letter 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:10.310
 naught scalded then on the outside if you 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:12.020
 we have put a little bit of lacquer for 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:13.880
 that these hairs cpe but 

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:18.410
 after we have since we 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:21.050
 here we catch bulb with each 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:22.730
 lacito and this role that we put in the 

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:25.930
 inside so that the rubber does not catch 

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:28.490
 directly to the hair ok we will do a 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:32.230
 arrangement and life typical expression of what 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:32.230
 that would be a Maltese
