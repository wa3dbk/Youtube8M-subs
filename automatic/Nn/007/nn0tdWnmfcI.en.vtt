fraps it's around 45 so there's there's
like<00:00:56.309> it<00:00:56.460> 20<00:00:56.910> frames<00:00:57.120> per<00:00:57.329> second<00:00:57.719> difference

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
like it 20 frames per second difference

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:05.899 
like it 20 frames per second difference
there<00:00:59.420> while<00:01:00.420> having<00:01:00.750> fraps<00:01:01.079> recording<00:01:04.909> let

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
there while having fraps recording let

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.770 
there while having fraps recording let
me<00:01:06.320> go<00:01:07.320> to<00:01:07.380> a<00:01:08.720> town

okay<00:01:11.780> right<00:01:12.619> now<00:01:12.860> it's<00:01:13.219> running<00:01:13.909> at<00:01:14.500> 33<00:01:15.500> that's

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:15.799 
okay right now it's running at 33 that's

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:18.010 
okay right now it's running at 33 that's
with<00:01:16.670> only<00:01:16.880> that<00:01:17.119> in<00:01:17.270> the<00:01:17.299> view<00:01:17.570> though<00:01:17.719> I'll

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:18.020 
with only that in the view though I'll

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:23.709 
with only that in the view though I'll
turn<00:01:18.200> around<00:01:18.530> quick<00:01:19.030> I've<00:01:20.030> got<00:01:20.659> 23<00:01:22.420> with<00:01:23.420> fraps

00:01:23.709 --> 00:01:23.719 
turn around quick I've got 23 with fraps

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:25.560 
turn around quick I've got 23 with fraps
recording<00:01:24.320> that's<00:01:24.530> pretty<00:01:24.860> much<00:01:24.950> the<00:01:25.009> same

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:25.570 
recording that's pretty much the same

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:30.010 
recording that's pretty much the same
soup<00:01:26.570> add<00:01:26.750> some<00:01:26.960> magic<00:01:27.289> someplace<00:01:27.590> else<00:01:29.020> Sam

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020 
soup add some magic someplace else Sam

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:37.539 
soup add some magic someplace else Sam
is<00:01:30.170> out<00:01:30.319> in<00:01:30.439> the<00:01:30.470> wilderness<00:01:36.039> right<00:01:37.039> about<00:01:37.219> 30

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:37.549 
is out in the wilderness right about 30

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:42.789 
is out in the wilderness right about 30
right<00:01:37.819> now<00:01:37.850> I<00:01:39.850> decided<00:01:40.850> to<00:01:41.179> turn<00:01:41.509> the<00:01:41.810> graphics

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:42.799 
right now I decided to turn the graphics

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:46.149 
right now I decided to turn the graphics
down<00:01:43.130> to<00:01:43.490> medium<00:01:44.149> and<00:01:44.360> see<00:01:45.319> how<00:01:45.500> well<00:01:45.679> that<00:01:45.709> ran

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:46.159 
down to medium and see how well that ran

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:50.230 
down to medium and see how well that ran
and<00:01:46.899> it<00:01:47.899> looks<00:01:48.560> like<00:01:48.709> with<00:01:49.459> while<00:01:49.819> recording

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 
and it looks like with while recording

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:55.990 
and it looks like with while recording
with<00:01:50.689> fraps<00:01:50.990> it<00:01:51.349> runs<00:01:51.740> at<00:01:54.189> 35<00:01:55.189> frames<00:01:55.700> per

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 
with fraps it runs at 35 frames per

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:02.100 
with fraps it runs at 35 frames per
second<00:01:56.420> most<00:01:56.840> of<00:01:56.929> the<00:01:56.989> time

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:02.110 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:04.890 

still<00:02:02.860> looks<00:02:03.070> pretty<00:02:03.190> good<00:02:03.640> not<00:02:04.180> on<00:02:04.450> not<00:02:04.720> bad

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:04.900 
still looks pretty good not on not bad

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:07.590 
still looks pretty good not on not bad
rocks<00:02:05.650> will<00:02:06.010> however<00:02:06.340> have<00:02:06.700> kind<00:02:07.120> of<00:02:07.150> a<00:02:07.240> gritty

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:07.600 
rocks will however have kind of a gritty

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.960 
rocks will however have kind of a gritty
look<00:02:07.840> to<00:02:08.050> them<00:02:08.170> like<00:02:08.619> like<00:02:09.340> that<00:02:09.610> one<00:02:09.820> right

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 
look to them like like that one right

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:19.850 
look to them like like that one right
there<00:02:12.840> you<00:02:13.840> can<00:02:14.050> see<00:02:14.320> there's<00:02:14.560> kind<00:02:14.890> of<00:02:15.010> a

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.480 

kind<00:02:20.490> of<00:02:20.550> a<00:02:20.670> grid<00:02:21.420> book<00:02:21.690> creator<00:02:22.230> I<00:02:22.530> don't<00:02:23.430> know

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:23.490 
kind of a grid book creator I don't know

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:26.090 
kind of a grid book creator I don't know
how<00:02:23.640> to<00:02:23.700> explain<00:02:24.240> it<00:02:24.530> that's<00:02:25.530> pretty<00:02:25.920> much<00:02:26.040> the

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
how to explain it that's pretty much the

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:27.970 
how to explain it that's pretty much the
only<00:02:26.310> difference<00:02:26.940> that<00:02:27.000> I've<00:02:27.210> seen<00:02:27.420> between

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
only difference that I've seen between

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.460 
only difference that I've seen between
medium<00:02:28.980> and<00:02:29.130> ultra<00:02:29.700> high<00:02:29.820> quality<00:02:30.240> if<00:02:30.840> you

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
medium and ultra high quality if you

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.380 
medium and ultra high quality if you
would<00:02:31.590> rather<00:02:31.740> have<00:02:32.040> the<00:02:32.220> frames<00:02:32.490> per<00:02:32.850> second

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
would rather have the frames per second

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.680 
would rather have the frames per second
then<00:02:34.190> definitely<00:02:35.190> just<00:02:35.910> turn<00:02:36.090> it<00:02:36.210> down<00:02:36.390> a

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
then definitely just turn it down a

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:40.160 
then definitely just turn it down a
little<00:02:37.020> bit<00:02:37.340> it's<00:02:38.340> not<00:02:38.820> all<00:02:39.690> that<00:02:39.990> necessary

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
little bit it's not all that necessary

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:44.480 
little bit it's not all that necessary
though<00:02:40.710> uh<00:02:41.780> let<00:02:42.780> me<00:02:42.810> check<00:02:43.200> quick<00:02:43.950> and<00:02:44.160> see

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:44.490 
though uh let me check quick and see

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:47.240 
though uh let me check quick and see
what<00:02:45.120> the<00:02:45.420> frame<00:02:45.720> rate<00:02:45.930> is<00:02:46.140> without<00:02:46.830> recording

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
what the frame rate is without recording

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:52.490 
what the frame rate is without recording
so<00:02:48.890> we<00:02:49.890> are<00:02:50.010> back<00:02:50.630> alright<00:02:51.630> guys<00:02:51.840> this<00:02:52.110> is<00:02:52.290> on

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
so we are back alright guys this is on

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:57.620 
so we are back alright guys this is on
medium<00:02:52.860> settings<00:02:53.250> and<00:02:54.110> it<00:02:55.110> runs<00:02:55.560> very<00:02:55.920> well<00:02:56.790> 35

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
medium settings and it runs very well 35

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:59.479 
medium settings and it runs very well 35
frames<00:02:57.989> per<00:02:58.290> second<00:02:58.650> while<00:02:58.770> recording<00:02:59.160> with

00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489 
frames per second while recording with

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:03.080 
frames per second while recording with
fraps<00:02:59.820> and<00:03:00.260> I<00:03:01.260> stopped<00:03:02.040> recording<00:03:02.400> fraps<00:03:02.850> to

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090
