little action scenes and kind of did
like<00:01:06.780> a<00:01:06.930> 360<00:01:07.680> so<00:01:07.830> you<00:01:07.920> get<00:01:08.100> a<00:01:08.130> good<00:01:08.400> idea<00:01:08.460> of

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
like a 360 so you get a good idea of

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.450 
like a 360 so you get a good idea of
what<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:09.540> maps<00:01:09.810> are<00:01:09.930> gonna<00:01:10.080> be<00:01:10.260> like<00:01:10.500> and<00:01:10.770> I

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
what the maps are gonna be like and I

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:12.890 
what the maps are gonna be like and I

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
think our suspicions have been confirmed

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.320 
think our suspicions have been confirmed
on<00:01:13.530> the<00:01:13.650> map<00:01:13.860> sighs<00:01:14.159> it's<00:01:14.729> going<00:01:15.060> to<00:01:15.180> be

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
on the map sighs it's going to be

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.749 
on the map sighs it's going to be
Caspian<00:01:16.229> Border<00:01:16.470> esque<00:01:16.860> I<00:01:17.189> mean<00:01:17.340> I'm<00:01:17.460> looking

comes to mind is caspian border and I've

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.060 
comes to mind is caspian border and I've
been<00:01:21.900> saying<00:01:22.170> that<00:01:22.320> since<00:01:22.380> the<00:01:22.680> get-go<00:01:23.040> that

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
soon as I saw those first Dells was like

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.230 
soon as I saw those first Dells was like
okay<00:01:25.470> this<00:01:25.890> expansion<00:01:26.520> looks<00:01:26.850> like<00:01:27.060> it's

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
okay this expansion looks like it's

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.999 
okay this expansion looks like it's
going<00:01:27.390> to<00:01:27.509> be<00:01:27.600> around<00:01:27.750> the<00:01:28.080> size<00:01:28.320> of<00:01:28.530> caspian

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
going to be around the size of caspian

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.950 
going to be around the size of caspian
border<00:01:29.040> which<00:01:29.790> is<00:01:29.970> great<00:01:30.240> because<00:01:30.450> i<00:01:30.659> think<00:01:30.720> it

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
border which is great because i think it

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.679 
border which is great because i think it
offers<00:01:31.140> a<00:01:31.350> lot<00:01:31.500> of<00:01:31.799> different<00:01:32.430> angles<00:01:33.150> not

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
offers a lot of different angles not

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.120 
offers a lot of different angles not
only<00:01:33.840> do<00:01:34.020> you<00:01:34.079> have<00:01:34.259> some<00:01:34.530> areas<00:01:34.740> where<00:01:35.040> it

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
only do you have some areas where it

battlefield like battlefield and you
know<00:01:57.840> I<00:01:57.899> like<00:01:58.170> high<00:01:58.350> action<00:01:58.590> gameplay<00:01:58.950> but

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
know I like high action gameplay but

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.889 
know I like high action gameplay but
every<00:01:59.490> once<00:01:59.670> in<00:01:59.790> a<00:01:59.850> while<00:02:00.030> I<00:02:00.060> want<00:02:00.420> to<00:02:00.509> play<00:02:00.750> it

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
every once in a while I want to play it

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.080 
every once in a while I want to play it
you<00:02:01.619> know<00:02:01.710> on<00:02:01.740> my<00:02:02.040> terms<00:02:02.310> I<00:02:02.549> want<00:02:02.700> to<00:02:02.759> take<00:02:02.909> it<00:02:02.939> a

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
you know on my terms I want to take it a

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.310 
you know on my terms I want to take it a
little<00:02:03.210> bit<00:02:03.420> slower<00:02:03.719> I<00:02:03.840> want<00:02:04.079> to<00:02:04.140> be<00:02:04.229> an

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
little bit slower I want to be an

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:05.929 
little bit slower I want to be an
engineer<00:02:04.469> out<00:02:04.890> there<00:02:05.070> destroying<00:02:05.399> vehicles

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
engineer out there destroying vehicles

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:08.089 
engineer out there destroying vehicles
and<00:02:06.090> stuff<00:02:06.119> like<00:02:06.390> that<00:02:06.450> so<00:02:06.899> I<00:02:07.170> think<00:02:07.710> it's

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
and stuff like that so I think it's

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.070 
and stuff like that so I think it's
going<00:02:08.220> to<00:02:08.340> be<00:02:08.399> a<00:02:08.729> lot<00:02:09.179> like<00:02:09.450> these<00:02:09.660> maps<00:02:09.899> I

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
going to be a lot like these maps I

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.380 
going to be a lot like these maps I
think<00:02:10.319> maybe<00:02:10.590> it<00:02:11.250> might<00:02:11.520> even<00:02:11.700> be<00:02:11.819> around<00:02:12.030> the

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
think maybe it might even be around the

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.380 
think maybe it might even be around the
size<00:02:12.599> of<00:02:12.930> like

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
size of like

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.420 
size of like
no<00:02:13.450> armored<00:02:14.290> shield<00:02:14.500> if<00:02:14.770> you<00:02:14.890> played<00:02:15.130> armored

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
no armored shield if you played armored

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:17.340 
no armored shield if you played armored
kill<00:02:15.670> you'll<00:02:15.940> know<00:02:16.060> armored<00:02:16.420> shield<00:02:16.660> you<00:02:17.260> know

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.350 
kill you'll know armored shield you know

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:19.110 
kill you'll know armored shield you know
there<00:02:17.650> wasn't<00:02:17.860> a<00:02:18.069> lot<00:02:18.220> to<00:02:18.430> that<00:02:18.640> map<00:02:18.850> it<00:02:19.000> was

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
there wasn't a lot to that map it was

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.360 
there wasn't a lot to that map it was
mostly<00:02:19.510> a<00:02:19.630> field<00:02:20.020> but<00:02:20.620> within<00:02:20.800> the<00:02:21.010> field<00:02:21.130> they

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
mostly a field but within the field they

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.160 
mostly a field but within the field they
had<00:02:21.550> you<00:02:21.730> know<00:02:21.760> congestion<00:02:22.480> zuv<00:02:22.780> buildings

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
had you know congestion zuv buildings

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:24.570 
had you know congestion zuv buildings
little<00:02:23.470> settlement<00:02:23.830> or<00:02:24.100> whatever<00:02:24.340> you<00:02:24.430> want

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580 
little settlement or whatever you want

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:25.860 
little settlement or whatever you want
to<00:02:24.610> call<00:02:24.760> it<00:02:24.819> where<00:02:25.090> the<00:02:25.209> action<00:02:25.660> took<00:02:25.810> place

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
to call it where the action took place

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:27.930 
to call it where the action took place
and<00:02:26.350> I<00:02:26.920> got<00:02:27.100> me<00:02:27.190> to<00:02:27.280> thinking<00:02:27.580> about<00:02:27.760> these

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
and I got me to thinking about these

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:29.790 
and I got me to thinking about these
maps<00:02:28.240> and<00:02:28.540> the<00:02:28.780> one<00:02:28.959> thing<00:02:29.200> that<00:02:29.230> always<00:02:29.530> comes

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:29.800 
maps and the one thing that always comes

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.860 
maps and the one thing that always comes
to<00:02:30.010> mind<00:02:30.190> soon<00:02:30.459> as<00:02:30.550> I<00:02:30.640> look<00:02:30.820> at<00:02:30.940> a<00:02:30.970> new<00:02:31.150> DLC<00:02:31.660> is

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
to mind soon as I look at a new DLC is

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:33.810 
to mind soon as I look at a new DLC is
what<00:02:32.290> is<00:02:32.410> it<00:02:32.560> going<00:02:32.709> to<00:02:32.800> be<00:02:32.920> like<00:02:32.950> on<00:02:33.340> console

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:33.820 
what is it going to be like on console

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:35.580 
what is it going to be like on console
because<00:02:34.180> you<00:02:34.360> guys<00:02:34.480> know<00:02:34.750> that<00:02:34.990> I<00:02:35.020> don't<00:02:35.170> like

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
because you guys know that I don't like

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:37.020 
because you guys know that I don't like
that<00:02:35.860> console<00:02:36.370> doesn't<00:02:36.550> get<00:02:36.760> the<00:02:36.880> full

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
that console doesn't get the full

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:38.850 
that console doesn't get the full
experience<00:02:37.150> I<00:02:37.600> don't<00:02:37.750> think<00:02:37.810> that's<00:02:38.050> fair<00:02:38.380> you

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
experience I don't think that's fair you

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:40.170 
experience I don't think that's fair you
know<00:02:38.950> being<00:02:39.220> someone<00:02:39.520> who<00:02:39.610> played<00:02:39.820> a<00:02:39.850> lot<00:02:40.060> of

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
know being someone who played a lot of

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.300 
know being someone who played a lot of
xbox<00:02:40.570> in<00:02:40.720> the<00:02:40.810> early<00:02:41.050> goings<00:02:41.380> as<00:02:41.530> well<00:02:41.739> on<00:02:41.890> PC

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
xbox in the early goings as well on PC

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.309 
xbox in the early goings as well on PC
you<00:02:42.819> know<00:02:42.910> it's<00:02:43.060> just<00:02:43.120> I<00:02:43.420> don't<00:02:43.840> think<00:02:44.110> that<00:02:44.290> a

00:02:44.309 --> 00:02:44.319 
you know it's just I don't think that a

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:46.560 
you know it's just I don't think that a
DLC<00:02:44.890> should<00:02:45.100> only<00:02:45.250> cater<00:02:45.640> to<00:02:45.820> one<00:02:46.000> group<00:02:46.330> but<00:02:46.510> I

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:46.570 
DLC should only cater to one group but I

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
DLC should only cater to one group but I
think<00:02:46.750> what<00:02:46.840> they're<00:02:46.959> trying<00:02:47.140> to<00:02:47.230> do<00:02:47.410> with

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
think what they're trying to do with

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:49.080 
think what they're trying to do with
this<00:02:47.709> one<00:02:47.950> is<00:02:48.070> give<00:02:48.250> you<00:02:48.370> the<00:02:48.520> best<00:02:48.760> of<00:02:48.940> both

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
this one is give you the best of both

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:51.390 
this one is give you the best of both
worlds<00:02:49.540> because<00:02:50.080> not<00:02:50.770> everybody<00:02:51.220> likes

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
worlds because not everybody likes

worlds because not everybody likes
fast-paced<00:02:51.970> gameplay<00:02:52.239> even<00:02:52.750> console<00:02:53.140> players

fast-paced gameplay even console players

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.830 
fast-paced gameplay even console players
some<00:02:53.560> people<00:02:53.860> like<00:02:54.130> a<00:02:54.160> more<00:02:54.670> tactical<00:02:55.180> type<00:02:55.600> B

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.280 
no map where you can play a little bit
slower<00:02:57.580> I<00:02:57.850> think<00:02:58.269> these<00:02:58.360> maps<00:02:58.660> are<00:02:58.840> going<00:02:59.170> to

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
slower I think these maps are going to

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:01.440 
slower I think these maps are going to
be<00:02:59.530> the<00:03:00.040> perfect<00:03:00.340> size<00:03:00.670> for<00:03:00.700> console<00:03:01.269> you're

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
be the perfect size for console you're

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:03.390 
be the perfect size for console you're
gonna<00:03:01.570> get<00:03:01.780> battlefield<00:03:02.170> experience<00:03:02.500> you

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.400 
gonna get battlefield experience you

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.550 
gonna get battlefield experience you
know<00:03:03.489> I<00:03:03.730> use<00:03:03.970> that<00:03:04.000> term<00:03:04.180> loosely<00:03:04.390> I<00:03:04.780> know<00:03:05.110> it's

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
know I use that term loosely I know it's

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.650 
know I use that term loosely I know it's
a<00:03:05.709> very<00:03:05.980> confusing<00:03:06.459> term<00:03:06.760> but<00:03:07.030> what<00:03:07.390> I<00:03:07.420> say

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:07.660 
a very confusing term but what I say

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:09.030 
a very confusing term but what I say
that<00:03:07.810> I<00:03:07.840> mostly<00:03:08.230> mean<00:03:08.440> you<00:03:08.590> know<00:03:08.709> like<00:03:08.920> a

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
that I mostly mean you know like a

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:10.800 
that I mostly mean you know like a
combination<00:03:09.730> of<00:03:09.820> inventory<00:03:10.269> and<00:03:10.420> vehicle

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
combination of inventory and vehicle

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:13.259 
combination of inventory and vehicle
gameplay<00:03:11.050> where<00:03:11.560> the<00:03:12.070> the<00:03:12.430> infantry<00:03:12.880> actually

00:03:13.259 --> 00:03:13.269 
gameplay where the the infantry actually

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:15.449 
gameplay where the the infantry actually
complements<00:03:13.959> the<00:03:14.080> vehicle<00:03:14.560> and<00:03:14.769> I<00:03:15.250> think

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:15.459 
complements the vehicle and I think

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:17.250 
complements the vehicle and I think
that's<00:03:15.610> important<00:03:16.120> I<00:03:16.209> think<00:03:16.269> that<00:03:16.660> if<00:03:16.840> you

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260 
that's important I think that if you

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:18.750 
that's important I think that if you
know<00:03:17.410> it<00:03:17.560> one<00:03:17.890> can't<00:03:18.160> keep<00:03:18.340> the<00:03:18.489> other<00:03:18.640> in

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 
know it one can't keep the other in

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.970 
know it one can't keep the other in
check<00:03:18.790> then<00:03:19.239> you<00:03:19.329> don't<00:03:19.570> have<00:03:19.860> what<00:03:20.860> you

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:20.980 
check then you don't have what you

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:22.710 
check then you don't have what you
really<00:03:21.220> truly<00:03:21.489> expect<00:03:21.910> out<00:03:22.090> of<00:03:22.120> battlefield

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720 
really truly expect out of battlefield

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.180 
really truly expect out of battlefield
and<00:03:22.900> that<00:03:23.350> was<00:03:23.470> the<00:03:23.590> problem<00:03:23.799> with<00:03:23.950> armored

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:24.190 
and that was the problem with armored

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:26.340 
and that was the problem with armored
kill<00:03:24.400> which<00:03:24.640> is<00:03:24.790> too<00:03:24.940> much<00:03:25.090> vehicle<00:03:25.540> at<00:03:25.660> one

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:26.350 
kill which is too much vehicle at one

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:28.050 
kill which is too much vehicle at one
you<00:03:26.860> know<00:03:26.950> at<00:03:27.130> some<00:03:27.310> point<00:03:27.370> you're<00:03:27.670> removing

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:28.060 
you know at some point you're removing

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:30.539 
you know at some point you're removing
the<00:03:28.299> infantry<00:03:28.750> from<00:03:28.870> the<00:03:29.049> equation<00:03:29.549> but

00:03:30.539 --> 00:03:30.549 
the infantry from the equation but

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:31.830 
the infantry from the equation but
that's<00:03:30.730> what<00:03:30.760> I<00:03:30.880> hope<00:03:31.090> they<00:03:31.239> really<00:03:31.450> do<00:03:31.690> with

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 
that's what I hope they really do with

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.479 
that's what I hope they really do with
these<00:03:31.959> new<00:03:32.200> maps<00:03:32.380> I<00:03:32.590> hope<00:03:32.769> they<00:03:32.920> make<00:03:33.130> it<00:03:33.190> so

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:33.489 
these new maps I hope they make it so

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:35.009 
these new maps I hope they make it so
that<00:03:33.730> okay<00:03:34.150> let's<00:03:34.390> make<00:03:34.510> them<00:03:34.660> a<00:03:34.720> little<00:03:34.810> bit

00:03:35.009 --> 00:03:35.019 
that okay let's make them a little bit

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:36.539 
that okay let's make them a little bit
more<00:03:35.140> spread<00:03:35.470> out<00:03:35.500> let's<00:03:35.920> make<00:03:36.160> them<00:03:36.340> a<00:03:36.370> little

00:03:36.539 --> 00:03:36.549 
more spread out let's make them a little

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:38.610 
more spread out let's make them a little
bit<00:03:36.790> more<00:03:36.940> wide<00:03:37.209> open<00:03:37.630> so<00:03:37.780> the<00:03:37.959> vehicles<00:03:38.380> can

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:38.620 
bit more wide open so the vehicles can

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:41.009 
bit more wide open so the vehicles can
can<00:03:39.130> have<00:03:39.310> some<00:03:39.519> room<00:03:39.700> to<00:03:39.760> breathe<00:03:39.910> because<00:03:40.510> if

00:03:41.009 --> 00:03:41.019 
can have some room to breathe because if

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:43.350 
can have some room to breathe because if
you've<00:03:41.140> ever<00:03:41.260> tried<00:03:41.500> to<00:03:41.620> tank<00:03:41.890> on<00:03:42.360> aftermath

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:43.360 
you've ever tried to tank on aftermath

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:44.670 
you've ever tried to tank on aftermath
it's<00:03:43.600> actually<00:03:43.900> kind<00:03:44.200> of<00:03:44.260> difficult

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:44.680 
it's actually kind of difficult

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:46.710 
it's actually kind of difficult
especially<00:03:44.860> on<00:03:45.220> the<00:03:45.310> higher<00:03:45.850> ticket<00:03:46.269> you<00:03:46.600> know

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:46.720 
especially on the higher ticket you know

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.660 
especially on the higher ticket you know
player<00:03:47.079> count<00:03:47.290> servers<00:03:47.769> they<00:03:47.920> can<00:03:48.100> get<00:03:48.280> really

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:48.670 
player count servers they can get really

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:50.130 
player count servers they can get really
difficult<00:03:49.360> when<00:03:49.480> you<00:03:49.570> have<00:03:49.600> all<00:03:49.840> those<00:03:49.930> RPGs

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:50.140 
difficult when you have all those RPGs

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:52.410 
difficult when you have all those RPGs
coming<00:03:50.799> at<00:03:50.890> you<00:03:51.010> so<00:03:51.190> it<00:03:51.280> is<00:03:51.400> nice<00:03:51.640> to<00:03:51.670> go<00:03:52.180> into<00:03:52.299> a

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:52.420 
coming at you so it is nice to go into a

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:53.880 
coming at you so it is nice to go into a
map<00:03:52.660> like<00:03:52.810> this<00:03:52.870> we<00:03:53.170> do<00:03:53.410> have<00:03:53.530> a<00:03:53.590> little<00:03:53.739> bit

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:53.890 
map like this we do have a little bit

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:55.110 
map like this we do have a little bit
more<00:03:54.040> breathing<00:03:54.310> room<00:03:54.519> you<00:03:54.850> do<00:03:54.940> have<00:03:55.090> the

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:55.120 
more breathing room you do have the

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.060 
more breathing room you do have the
ability<00:03:55.810> to<00:03:55.840> move<00:03:56.079> around<00:03:56.260> without<00:03:56.650> being

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:57.070 
ability to move around without being

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:00.539 
ability to move around without being
spotted<00:03:57.459> instantly<00:03:58.620> but<00:03:59.620> you<00:03:59.829> know<00:03:59.920> I<00:03:59.950> do<00:04:00.100> i<00:04:00.280> do

00:04:00.539 --> 00:04:00.549 
spotted instantly but you know I do i do

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:02.250 
spotted instantly but you know I do i do
see<00:04:00.880> the<00:04:01.030> value<00:04:01.360> in<00:04:01.540> those<00:04:01.690> types<00:04:01.930> of<00:04:02.110> maps

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:02.260 
see the value in those types of maps

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:03.780 
see the value in those types of maps
they<00:04:02.440> are<00:04:02.590> fun<00:04:02.920> and<00:04:02.950> kind<00:04:03.340> of<00:04:03.430> mix<00:04:03.610> up<00:04:03.730> your

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:03.790 
they are fun and kind of mix up your

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:04.979 
they are fun and kind of mix up your
game<00:04:04.000> play<00:04:04.239> to<00:04:04.299> play<00:04:04.480> a<00:04:04.540> little<00:04:04.690> bit<00:04:04.870> more

00:04:04.979 --> 00:04:04.989 
game play to play a little bit more

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:07.890 
game play to play a little bit more
faster<00:04:05.470> pace<00:04:05.820> but<00:04:06.820> looking<00:04:07.090> at<00:04:07.180> these<00:04:07.299> maps<00:04:07.510> I

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:07.900 
faster pace but looking at these maps I

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:09.750 
faster pace but looking at these maps I
see<00:04:08.560> them<00:04:08.680> and<00:04:08.860> I'm<00:04:08.920> like<00:04:08.950> okay<00:04:09.220> these<00:04:09.579> look

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:09.760 
see them and I'm like okay these look

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:11.340 
see them and I'm like okay these look
like<00:04:09.790> wide<00:04:10.150> open<00:04:10.180> fields<00:04:10.840> it<00:04:10.930> looks<00:04:11.079> like<00:04:11.200> it's

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:11.350 
like wide open fields it looks like it's

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:13.319 
like wide open fields it looks like it's
going<00:04:11.470> to<00:04:11.590> be<00:04:11.709> a<00:04:11.739> lot<00:04:12.070> more<00:04:12.100> spread<00:04:12.640> out<00:04:12.670> with

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:13.329 
going to be a lot more spread out with

00:04:13.329 --> 00:04:14.819 
going to be a lot more spread out with
the<00:04:13.480> buildings<00:04:13.930> that<00:04:14.049> are<00:04:14.140> clustered<00:04:14.680> in

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:14.829 
the buildings that are clustered in

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:16.319 
the buildings that are clustered in
certain<00:04:15.130> areas<00:04:15.250> that's<00:04:15.640> where<00:04:15.850> you<00:04:16.060> know<00:04:16.150> the

00:04:16.319 --> 00:04:16.329 
certain areas that's where you know the

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:18.479 
certain areas that's where you know the
incomes<00:04:16.690> will<00:04:16.900> be<00:04:17.039> that's<00:04:18.039> where<00:04:18.220> all<00:04:18.340> the

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:18.489 
incomes will be that's where all the

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:21.150 
incomes will be that's where all the
action<00:04:18.640> will<00:04:19.000> be<00:04:19.410> but<00:04:20.410> the<00:04:20.560> thing<00:04:20.739> that<00:04:20.769> really

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:21.160 
action will be but the thing that really

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.310 
action will be but the thing that really
bothers<00:04:21.609> me<00:04:21.789> that<00:04:21.820> makes<00:04:22.210> me<00:04:22.390> worried<00:04:22.870> is<00:04:23.080> that

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:23.320 
bothers me that makes me worried is that

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:25.020 
bothers me that makes me worried is that
maybe<00:04:23.650> it's<00:04:23.860> too<00:04:24.010> spread<00:04:24.280> out<00:04:24.340> maybe<00:04:24.729> we're

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:25.030 
maybe it's too spread out maybe we're

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:26.460 
maybe it's too spread out maybe we're
not<00:04:25.240> going<00:04:25.599> to<00:04:25.690> get<00:04:25.840> enough

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:26.470 
not going to get enough

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:28.530 
not going to get enough

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:28.540 
to make it exciting and people give up

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:30.810 
to make it exciting and people give up
on<00:04:28.720> it<00:04:28.830> because<00:04:29.830> if<00:04:29.950> you<00:04:30.040> don't<00:04:30.130> like<00:04:30.340> caspian

to and in the battlefield 3 map you know
it'd<00:04:48.490> be<00:04:48.520> easier<00:04:48.910> to<00:04:48.940> compare<00:04:49.300> it<00:04:49.360> to<00:04:49.450> maybe

making me think that it's going to be
like<00:04:57.280> that<00:04:57.520> because<00:04:57.730> you<00:04:58.600> know<00:04:58.660> I've<00:04:58.900> had<00:04:59.050> a

like that because you know I've had a

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:00.630 
like that because you know I've had a
lot<00:04:59.260> of<00:04:59.320> predictions<00:04:59.650> about<00:05:00.010> maps<00:05:00.430> on

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:00.640 
lot of predictions about maps on

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:02.370 
lot of predictions about maps on
battlefield<00:05:01.120> 3<00:05:01.360> in<00:05:01.450> the<00:05:01.570> past<00:05:01.810> and<00:05:02.080> they<00:05:02.140> have

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:02.380 
battlefield 3 in the past and they have

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:04.380 
battlefield 3 in the past and they have
not<00:05:02.650> played<00:05:02.950> out<00:05:03.100> like<00:05:03.340> I<00:05:03.430> expected<00:05:03.460> aftermath

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:04.390 
not played out like I expected aftermath

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:05.640 
not played out like I expected aftermath
maps<00:05:04.660> would<00:05:04.840> be<00:05:04.900> different<00:05:05.410> than<00:05:05.560> they

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:05.650

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:07.410 
maps would be different than they
actually<00:05:05.800> ended<00:05:06.160> up<00:05:06.220> playing<00:05:06.520> out<00:05:06.730> there<00:05:07.330> are

actually a lot smaller than I thought
they<00:05:09.130> would<00:05:09.160> be<00:05:09.310> I<00:05:09.430> mean<00:05:10.080> they're<00:05:11.080> on<00:05:11.260> the

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:11.470 
they would be I mean they're on the

they would be I mean they're on the
scale<00:05:11.950> they<00:05:12.280> kind<00:05:12.490> of<00:05:12.520> remind<00:05:12.640> me<00:05:12.880> of<00:05:12.940> Grand

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:36.820 
premium trailer it didn't really show us

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:38.940 
premium trailer it didn't really show us
a<00:05:36.850> lot<00:05:37.150> that<00:05:37.330> we<00:05:37.419> had<00:05:37.600> not<00:05:37.810> seen<00:05:37.870> so<00:05:38.770> if<00:05:38.830> you're

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:48.150 
little underwhelmed if you watch it as
well<00:05:46.270> but<00:05:47.020> it<00:05:47.169> does<00:05:47.290> show<00:05:47.320> off<00:05:47.680> you<00:05:47.860> know<00:05:47.979> some

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:48.160 
well but it does show off you know some

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:49.890 
well but it does show off you know some
of<00:05:48.190> the<00:05:48.310> dynamics<00:05:48.490> of<00:05:48.880> the<00:05:48.970> map<00:05:49.180> i<00:05:49.330> expect<00:05:49.750> them

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:49.900 
of the dynamics of the map i expect them

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:52.800 
of the dynamics of the map i expect them
to<00:05:50.080> be<00:05:50.850> easy<00:05:51.850> to<00:05:52.000> get<00:05:52.210> from<00:05:52.360> point<00:05:52.540> A<00:05:52.660> to<00:05:52.690> point

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:52.810 
to be easy to get from point A to point

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:54.510 
to be easy to get from point A to point
B<00:05:53.050> and<00:05:53.169> I<00:05:53.290> think<00:05:53.470> that's<00:05:53.620> important<00:05:54.130> to<00:05:54.280> make

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:54.520 
B and I think that's important to make

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:56.550 
B and I think that's important to make
this<00:05:54.700> a<00:05:54.760> successful<00:05:55.270> DLC<00:05:55.930> because<00:05:56.290> that<00:05:56.440> was

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:56.560 
this a successful DLC because that was

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:58.200 
this a successful DLC because that was
the<00:05:56.680> problem<00:05:56.919> with<00:05:57.100> armored<00:05:57.370> kill<00:05:57.580> it<00:05:57.760> took<00:05:57.940> so

00:05:58.200 --> 00:05:58.210 
the problem with armored kill it took so

00:05:58.210 --> 00:05:59.969 
the problem with armored kill it took so
long<00:05:58.240> to<00:05:58.660> get<00:05:58.840> to<00:05:58.900> each<00:05:59.110> different<00:05:59.350> conquest

00:05:59.969 --> 00:05:59.979 
long to get to each different conquest

00:05:59.979 --> 00:06:02.340 
long to get to each different conquest
flag<00:06:00.220> there<00:06:00.790> is<00:06:00.910> so<00:06:01.240> much<00:06:01.479> space<00:06:01.780> between<00:06:01.960> em

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:02.350 
flag there is so much space between em

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:03.659 
flag there is so much space between em
comms<00:06:02.620> you<00:06:02.890> know<00:06:03.010> it<00:06:03.190> just<00:06:03.400> made<00:06:03.640> it

00:06:03.659 --> 00:06:03.669 
comms you know it just made it

00:06:03.669 --> 00:06:06.300 
comms you know it just made it
ridiculous<00:06:04.330> and<00:06:04.570> yeah<00:06:05.140> the<00:06:05.650> good<00:06:05.800> thing<00:06:05.830> is<00:06:06.040> is

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:06.310 
ridiculous and yeah the good thing is is

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:08.190 
ridiculous and yeah the good thing is is
the<00:06:06.400> ac-130<00:06:07.000> won't<00:06:07.330> be<00:06:07.570> there<00:06:07.780> and<00:06:07.930> I<00:06:07.960> think

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:08.200 
the ac-130 won't be there and I think

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:09.600 
the ac-130 won't be there and I think
this<00:06:08.350> will<00:06:08.500> be<00:06:08.560> a<00:06:08.710> whole<00:06:09.010> different<00:06:09.040> ballgame

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:09.610 
this will be a whole different ballgame

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:11.430 
this will be a whole different ballgame
for<00:06:09.970> you<00:06:10.060> guys<00:06:10.210> I<00:06:10.240> think<00:06:10.660> that<00:06:10.840> if<00:06:10.990> you<00:06:11.110> hated

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:11.440 
for you guys I think that if you hated

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:13.530 
for you guys I think that if you hated
armored<00:06:11.919> kill<00:06:12.100> because<00:06:12.310> of<00:06:12.580> the<00:06:12.640> ac-130<00:06:13.240> I

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:13.540 
armored kill because of the ac-130 I

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:14.940 
armored kill because of the ac-130 I
think<00:06:14.020> with<00:06:14.140> this<00:06:14.320> you're<00:06:14.560> going<00:06:14.710> to<00:06:14.800> be

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:14.950 
think with this you're going to be

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:16.770 
think with this you're going to be
satisfied<00:06:15.460> because<00:06:15.610> not<00:06:15.940> only<00:06:15.970> are<00:06:16.270> we<00:06:16.419> going

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:16.780 
satisfied because not only are we going

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:19.110 
satisfied because not only are we going
