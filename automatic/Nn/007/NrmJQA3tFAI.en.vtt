00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
Mac at least in my testing so let's take

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:41.690 
Mac at least in my testing so let's take
a<00:00:40.559> look<00:00:40.710> at<00:00:40.800> the<00:00:40.860> hardware<00:00:41.100> real<00:00:41.370> quick<00:00:41.579> and

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.100 
why it's blinking the way it is but this
is<00:01:23.670> a<00:01:23.700> two<00:01:23.820> color<00:01:24.240> light<00:01:24.630> here<00:01:24.930> in<00:01:25.020> the

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
is a two color light here in the

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.260 
is a two color light here in the
microphone<00:01:25.590> that<00:01:25.740> comes<00:01:25.950> out<00:01:26.189> and<00:01:26.340> what<00:01:27.119> this

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
microphone that comes out and what this

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.149 
microphone that comes out and what this
does<00:01:27.509> is<00:01:27.689> if<00:01:27.840> it'll<00:01:28.049> indicate<00:01:28.470> white<00:01:28.979> if

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
does is if it'll indicate white if

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.890 
does is if it'll indicate white if
you're<00:01:29.280> in<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:29.520> standard<00:01:29.880> mode<00:01:30.090> and<00:01:30.329> red<00:01:30.659> if

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
you're in the standard mode and red if

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.140 
you're in the standard mode and red if
you're<00:01:31.350> in<00:01:31.560> the<00:01:31.829> basilar<00:01:32.400> mode<00:01:32.640> which<00:01:32.880> is<00:01:33.000> kind

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
you're in the basilar mode which is kind

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.670 
you're in the basilar mode which is kind
of<00:01:33.180> an<00:01:33.299> odd<00:01:33.450> choice<00:01:33.479> that<00:01:34.140> you<00:01:34.229> would<00:01:34.320> actually

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
of an odd choice that you would actually

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.380 
of an odd choice that you would actually
make<00:01:34.890> this<00:01:35.009> an<00:01:35.159> indicator<00:01:35.549> light<00:01:35.670> for<00:01:36.240> the

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
make this an indicator light for the

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.480 
make this an indicator light for the
audio<00:01:37.049> mode<00:01:37.320> as<00:01:37.500> opposed<00:01:37.799> to<00:01:37.979> whether<00:01:38.220> or<00:01:38.400> not

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
audio mode as opposed to whether or not

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.340 
audio mode as opposed to whether or not
it<00:01:38.670> is<00:01:38.729> muted<00:01:39.180> so<00:01:39.270> you<00:01:39.360> can<00:01:39.630> mute<00:01:39.810> the<00:01:40.020> mic<00:01:40.200> just

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
it is muted so you can mute the mic just

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.499 
it is muted so you can mute the mic just
by<00:01:40.500> pushing<00:01:40.799> this<00:01:41.009> in<00:01:41.340> except<00:01:42.030> what<00:01:42.180> happens

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
by pushing this in except what happens

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.810 
by pushing this in except what happens
is<00:01:42.630> it'll<00:01:42.840> blink<00:01:43.140> twice<00:01:43.470> to<00:01:43.860> indicate<00:01:44.520> that<00:01:44.670> it

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
is it'll blink twice to indicate that it

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.700 
is it'll blink twice to indicate that it
is<00:01:44.970> changed<00:01:45.600> its<00:01:45.750> mode<00:01:45.990> the<00:01:46.229> microphone<00:01:46.590> has

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
is changed its mode the microphone has

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.170 
is changed its mode the microphone has
changed<00:01:46.979> its<00:01:47.100> mode<00:01:47.280> but<00:01:47.670> then<00:01:47.759> it<00:01:47.850> goes<00:01:47.970> back

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
changed its mode but then it goes back

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.030 
changed its mode but then it goes back
to<00:01:48.360> whatever<00:01:48.630> color<00:01:48.930> it<00:01:49.170> was<00:01:49.290> on<00:01:49.439> before<00:01:49.649> and

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
to whatever color it was on before and

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.620 
to whatever color it was on before and
then<00:01:50.159> we'll<00:01:50.250> like<00:01:50.369> maybe<00:01:50.579> blink<00:01:50.970> once<00:01:51.479> a

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
then we'll like maybe blink once a

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.090 
then we'll like maybe blink once a
minute<00:01:51.840> or<00:01:52.049> so<00:01:52.259> to<00:01:52.290> let<00:01:52.500> you<00:01:52.619> know<00:01:52.770> that<00:01:52.799> it's

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
minute or so to let you know that it's

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.380 
minute or so to let you know that it's
still<00:01:53.310> muted<00:01:53.579> I<00:01:53.820> think<00:01:53.939> that<00:01:54.030> was<00:01:54.119> kind<00:01:54.210> of<00:01:54.299> an

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
still muted I think that was kind of an

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:55.789 
still muted I think that was kind of an
odd<00:01:54.570> choice<00:01:54.899> I<00:01:55.110> would<00:01:55.229> have<00:01:55.320> preferred<00:01:55.619> that

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
odd choice I would have preferred that

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.800 
odd choice I would have preferred that
they<00:01:55.950> had<00:01:56.430> the<00:01:56.579> microphone<00:01:56.909> be<00:01:57.270> red<00:01:57.540> when<00:01:57.719> it

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
they had the microphone be red when it

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.200 
they had the microphone be red when it
was<00:01:57.899> muted<00:01:58.259> and<00:01:58.439> white<00:01:59.280> when<00:01:59.579> it<00:01:59.700> wasn't

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
was muted and white when it wasn't

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.910 
was muted and white when it wasn't
it<00:02:00.360> also<00:02:00.540> doesn't<00:02:00.869> you<00:02:01.110> automatically<00:02:01.710> when

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
it also doesn't you automatically when

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.590 
it also doesn't you automatically when
it<00:02:02.009> goes<00:02:02.130> back<00:02:02.340> into<00:02:02.640> its<00:02:02.790> little<00:02:03.030> holder<00:02:03.390> here

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
it goes back into its little holder here

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:04.880 
it goes back into its little holder here
so<00:02:03.750> that<00:02:03.869> was<00:02:03.960> a<00:02:03.990> problem<00:02:04.229> for<00:02:04.380> me<00:02:04.680> too

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
so that was a problem for me too

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.139 
so that was a problem for me too
actually<00:02:05.460> got<00:02:05.579> another<00:02:05.700> problem<00:02:05.909> with<00:02:06.090> the

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
actually got another problem with the

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:07.280 
actually got another problem with the
microphone<00:02:06.540> too<00:02:06.689> while<00:02:06.869> we're<00:02:06.990> on<00:02:07.110> the<00:02:07.259> topic

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
microphone too while we're on the topic

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.650 
microphone too while we're on the topic
I<00:02:07.770> doesn't<00:02:08.129> sound<00:02:08.520> all<00:02:08.759> that<00:02:09.000> loud<00:02:09.300> and<00:02:09.629> I

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
I doesn't sound all that loud and I

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.360 
I doesn't sound all that loud and I
think<00:02:09.869> it's<00:02:10.140> a<00:02:10.289> couple<00:02:10.709> reasons<00:02:10.830> for<00:02:11.039> it<00:02:11.250> one

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
think it's a couple reasons for it one

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:12.920 
think it's a couple reasons for it one
it<00:02:11.459> doesn't<00:02:11.580> extend<00:02:11.910> all<00:02:12.239> that<00:02:12.450> far<00:02:12.720> so<00:02:12.900> you

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
it doesn't extend all that far so you

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:13.900 
it doesn't extend all that far so you
can't<00:02:13.170> really<00:02:13.319> get<00:02:13.500> it<00:02:13.590> out

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
can't really get it out

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:14.980 
can't really get it out
running<00:02:14.090> your<00:02:14.180> mouth<00:02:14.360> here<00:02:14.600> just<00:02:14.810> kind<00:02:14.930> of

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:14.990 
running your mouth here just kind of

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:17.590 
running your mouth here just kind of
stops<00:02:15.320> right<00:02:15.650> here<00:02:16.100> and<00:02:16.790> it's<00:02:16.970> also<00:02:17.120> just<00:02:17.450> not

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:17.600 
stops right here and it's also just not

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.450 
stops right here and it's also just not
-<00:02:17.930> very<00:02:18.230> loudly<00:02:18.470> through<00:02:18.890> the<00:02:19.070> wireless

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:19.460 
- very loudly through the wireless

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:20.680 
- very loudly through the wireless
adapter<00:02:19.940> and<00:02:20.030> I<00:02:20.060> tried<00:02:20.270> a<00:02:20.300> whole<00:02:20.450> bunch<00:02:20.630> of

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
adapter and I tried a whole bunch of

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:22.120 
adapter and I tried a whole bunch of
different<00:02:20.780> things<00:02:21.200> just<00:02:21.440> to<00:02:21.770> make<00:02:21.890> sure<00:02:22.040> it

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.130 
different things just to make sure it

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:23.500 
different things just to make sure it
wasn't<00:02:22.310> just<00:02:22.580> me<00:02:22.790> so<00:02:22.970> I<00:02:23.000> made<00:02:23.120> a<00:02:23.150> couple<00:02:23.360> of

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
wasn't just me so I made a couple of

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.840 
wasn't just me so I made a couple of
calls<00:02:23.780> on<00:02:24.020> skype<00:02:24.590> on<00:02:24.710> my<00:02:24.830> xbox<00:02:25.130> I<00:02:25.460> went<00:02:25.670> into<00:02:25.820> a

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:25.850 
calls on skype on my xbox I went into a

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:27.370 
calls on skype on my xbox I went into a
couple<00:02:26.120> of<00:02:26.240> chat<00:02:26.420> rooms<00:02:26.660> with<00:02:26.870> everyone<00:02:27.260> said

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:27.380 
couple of chat rooms with everyone said

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:28.900 
couple of chat rooms with everyone said
I<00:02:27.440> was<00:02:27.470> kind<00:02:27.710> of<00:02:27.740> low<00:02:27.950> and<00:02:28.190> then<00:02:28.490> I<00:02:28.580> plugged<00:02:28.820> it

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
I was kind of low and then I plugged it

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:30.730 
I was kind of low and then I plugged it
into<00:02:29.030> my<00:02:29.210> Windows<00:02:29.570> PC<00:02:29.990> and<00:02:30.140> tried<00:02:30.290> to<00:02:30.320> record

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:30.740 
into my Windows PC and tried to record

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:33.220 
into my Windows PC and tried to record
just<00:02:31.430> using<00:02:31.760> audacity<00:02:32.030> with<00:02:32.510> this<00:02:32.720> and<00:02:32.990> again

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
just using audacity with this and again

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.080 
just using audacity with this and again
it<00:02:33.320> was<00:02:33.440> very<00:02:33.620> low<00:02:33.890> there<00:02:34.220> -<00:02:34.550> and<00:02:34.760> I<00:02:34.790> think<00:02:34.850> it's

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
it was very low there - and I think it's

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:36.580 
it was very low there - and I think it's
just<00:02:35.180> how<00:02:35.390> they<00:02:35.540> tune<00:02:35.840> this<00:02:36.080> mic<00:02:36.290> it<00:02:36.470> just

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
just how they tune this mic it just

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:38.350 
just how they tune this mic it just
isn't<00:02:36.890> all<00:02:37.070> that<00:02:37.100> loud<00:02:37.640> so<00:02:37.880> if<00:02:37.970> you're<00:02:38.090> doing<00:02:38.210> a

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 
isn't all that loud so if you're doing a

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.270
