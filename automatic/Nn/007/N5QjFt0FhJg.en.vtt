00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
there's just two of us so I didn't get

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.799 
there's just two of us so I didn't get
too<00:00:35.250> many<00:00:35.399> of<00:00:35.610> them<00:00:35.760> because<00:00:36.570> I'm<00:00:36.660> actually

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
too many of them because I'm actually

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.410 
too many of them because I'm actually
making<00:00:37.079> other<00:00:37.950> things<00:00:38.219> for<00:00:38.399> dinner<00:00:38.520> so<00:00:39.390> I

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
making other things for dinner so I

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.440 
making other things for dinner so I
start<00:00:40.379> with<00:00:40.760> boiling<00:00:41.760> water<00:00:42.059> and<00:00:42.590> then<00:00:43.590> just

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:44.450 
start with boiling water and then just

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:49.430 
start with boiling water and then just
about<00:00:45.450> that<00:00:46.140> much<00:00:46.440> salt<00:00:46.770> in<00:00:47.160> it<00:00:48.020> to<00:00:49.020> salt<00:00:49.289> the

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
about that much salt in it to salt the

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.529 
about that much salt in it to salt the
potatoes<00:00:52.160> okay<00:00:53.160> so<00:00:53.489> then<00:00:53.670> I<00:00:53.969> chopped<00:00:54.390> the

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
potatoes okay so then I chopped the

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.119 
potatoes okay so then I chopped the
potatoes<00:00:54.989> and<00:00:55.199> I<00:00:55.289> try<00:00:55.500> to<00:00:55.559> get<00:00:55.739> them<00:00:55.920> all

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
potatoes and I try to get them all

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.869 
potatoes and I try to get them all
uniformly<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:57.239> same<00:00:57.510> size<00:00:57.899> so<00:00:58.800> that<00:00:58.879> they

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
uniformly the same size so that they

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:06.109 
uniformly the same size so that they
cook<00:01:00.469> the<00:01:01.469> same<00:01:03.890> about<00:01:04.890> that<00:01:05.159> big<00:01:05.430> I<00:01:05.670> guess<00:01:05.880> it

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
cook the same about that big I guess it

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.310 
cook the same about that big I guess it
would<00:01:06.210> be<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.479> size<00:01:06.750> of<00:01:06.960> a<00:01:08.810> gyro<00:01:09.810> a<00:01:09.840> potato

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
would be the size of a gyro a potato

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.520 
would be the size of a gyro a potato
that's<00:01:10.500> cut<00:01:10.710> into<00:01:10.890> quarters<00:01:12.049> so<00:01:13.049> I<00:01:13.080> cut<00:01:13.409> them

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
that's cut into quarters so I cut them

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.420 
that's cut into quarters so I cut them
all<00:01:13.680> about<00:01:14.100> that<00:01:14.340> same<00:01:14.640> size<00:01:15.920> and<00:01:16.920> if<00:01:17.070> you<00:01:17.189> cut

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
all about that same size and if you cut

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.749 
all about that same size and if you cut
them<00:01:17.610> too<00:01:17.790> small<00:01:17.820> I<00:01:18.479> find<00:01:18.810> that<00:01:18.960> they<00:01:19.110> get<00:01:19.759> they

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
them too small I find that they get they

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.060 
them too small I find that they get they
fall<00:01:21.000> apart<00:01:21.360> when<00:01:21.720> you<00:01:21.840> try<00:01:22.049> to<00:01:22.080> mash<00:01:22.619> them<00:01:22.799> and

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
fall apart when you try to mash them and

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.929 
fall apart when you try to mash them and
then<00:01:23.820> they<00:01:23.970> get<00:01:24.210> kind<00:01:24.509> of<00:01:24.570> gummy<00:01:24.840> when<00:01:25.140> you<00:01:25.229> add

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:25.939 
then they get kind of gummy when you add

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:30.350 
then they get kind of gummy when you add
the<00:01:27.979> milk<00:01:28.979> and<00:01:29.159> stuff<00:01:29.400> afterwards<00:01:29.759> so<00:01:30.210> make

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
the milk and stuff afterwards so make

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.179 
the milk and stuff afterwards so make
sure<00:01:30.540> that<00:01:30.689> they<00:01:30.840> are<00:01:30.990> not<00:01:31.290> too<00:01:31.619> small<00:01:31.920> and

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
sure that they are not too small and

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:36.219 
sure that they are not too small and
then<00:01:33.180> if<00:01:33.329> you<00:01:33.479> get<00:01:33.720> these<00:01:34.140> little<00:01:34.439> dark<00:01:35.220> spots

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:36.229 
then if you get these little dark spots

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:39.440 
then if you get these little dark spots
these<00:01:37.229> little<00:01:37.530> dark<00:01:37.680> spots<00:01:37.950> on<00:01:38.310> your<00:01:38.450> potatoes

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
these little dark spots on your potatoes

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.330 
these little dark spots on your potatoes
just<00:01:39.750> cut<00:01:40.290> them<00:01:40.409> off<00:01:40.530> because<00:01:40.770> I<00:01:41.009> keep<00:01:41.189> the

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
just cut them off because I keep the

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:42.980 
just cut them off because I keep the
skins<00:01:41.640> on<00:01:41.850> when<00:01:41.970> I<00:01:42.060> mash<00:01:42.270> them<00:01:42.479> and<00:01:42.630> those<00:01:42.720> make

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
skins on when I mash them and those make

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.580 
skins on when I mash them and those make
them<00:01:43.140> kind<00:01:43.350> of<00:01:44.210> unpleasant<00:01:45.530> okay<00:01:46.530> so

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
them kind of unpleasant okay so

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.109 
them kind of unpleasant okay so
basically<00:01:47.009> now<00:01:47.399> you're<00:01:47.610> just<00:01:47.759> going<00:01:47.909> to<00:01:47.970> put

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
basically now you're just going to put

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.030 
basically now you're just going to put
all<00:01:48.240> of<00:01:48.270> your<00:01:48.420> potatoes<00:01:48.750> into<00:01:49.259> your<00:01:49.590> pot<00:01:49.829> of

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:55.180 
splash yourself with hot boiling water

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:58.560 
splash yourself with hot boiling water
it<00:01:55.630> will<00:01:55.780> burn<00:01:55.990> the<00:01:56.200> crap<00:01:56.440> out<00:01:56.620> of<00:01:56.650> you<00:01:56.920> a<00:01:57.570> lot

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:58.570 
it will burn the crap out of you a lot

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:01.380 
it will burn the crap out of you a lot
of<00:01:58.690> people<00:01:58.930> start<00:01:59.140> boiled<00:01:59.500> eggs<00:01:59.650> in<00:02:00.390> unboiled

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:01.390 
of people start boiled eggs in unboiled

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:04.230 
of people start boiled eggs in unboiled
water<00:02:01.420> or<00:02:02.080> on<00:02:02.380> heated<00:02:03.010> water<00:02:03.190> which<00:02:03.850> is<00:02:04.030> fine

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:04.240 
water or on heated water which is fine

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
water or on heated water which is fine
but<00:02:04.480> you<00:02:04.540> don't<00:02:04.630> want<00:02:04.870> to<00:02:04.930> do<00:02:04.990> that<00:02:05.080> with

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:05.260 
but you don't want to do that with

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.620 
but you don't want to do that with
potatoes<00:02:05.740> because<00:02:06.220> they'll<00:02:07.000> absorb<00:02:07.210> the

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:07.630 
potatoes because they'll absorb the

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:09.719 
potatoes because they'll absorb the
water<00:02:07.780> and<00:02:08.170> then<00:02:08.710> you'll<00:02:08.830> have<00:02:08.979> watery<00:02:09.399> mashed

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:09.729 
water and then you'll have watery mashed

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:11.730 
water and then you'll have watery mashed
potatoes<00:02:10.149> so<00:02:10.360> you<00:02:10.420> want<00:02:10.720> the<00:02:11.140> water<00:02:11.320> to<00:02:11.440> be<00:02:11.620> as

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:11.740 
potatoes so you want the water to be as

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:13.860 
potatoes so you want the water to be as
hot<00:02:11.920> as<00:02:12.160> possible<00:02:12.270> so<00:02:13.270> that<00:02:13.300> they<00:02:13.480> cook<00:02:13.720> as

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
hot as possible so that they cook as

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:15.030 
hot as possible so that they cook as
fast<00:02:14.080> as<00:02:14.230> possible<00:02:14.620> because<00:02:14.709> the<00:02:14.830> longer

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
fast as possible because the longer

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.890 
fast as possible because the longer
they're<00:02:15.250> in<00:02:15.280> the<00:02:15.400> water<00:02:15.580> the<00:02:15.910> more<00:02:16.630> water

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
they're in the water the more water

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.640 
they're in the water the more water
they'll<00:02:17.170> actually<00:02:17.680> absorb<00:02:19.170> okay<00:02:20.170> so<00:02:20.230> you<00:02:20.410> want

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
they'll actually absorb okay so you want

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.720 
they'll actually absorb okay so you want
to<00:02:20.740> boil<00:02:20.950> them<00:02:21.160> until<00:02:21.250> they<00:02:21.700> get<00:02:22.020> fork<00:02:23.020> soft<00:02:23.730> so

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
to boil them until they get fork soft so

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.570 
to boil them until they get fork soft so
basically<00:02:25.530> when<00:02:26.530> a<00:02:26.560> fork<00:02:26.860> can<00:02:27.040> just<00:02:27.250> go<00:02:27.430> into

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.580 
basically when a fork can just go into

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:29.400 
basically when a fork can just go into
them<00:02:27.820> easily<00:02:28.239> but<00:02:28.840> they're<00:02:28.989> not<00:02:29.080> falling

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
them easily but they're not falling

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:30.840 
them easily but they're not falling
apart<00:02:29.620> yet<00:02:29.800> you<00:02:29.920> can<00:02:30.040> see<00:02:30.160> the<00:02:30.280> skins<00:02:30.520> kind<00:02:30.790> of

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:30.850 
apart yet you can see the skins kind of

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:32.580 
apart yet you can see the skins kind of
fall<00:02:31.000> off<00:02:31.180> of<00:02:31.209> them<00:02:31.480> which<00:02:31.630> is<00:02:31.660> fine<00:02:32.020> as<00:02:32.260> long

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
fall off of them which is fine as long

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:33.570 
fall off of them which is fine as long
as<00:02:32.800> they're<00:02:32.980> not<00:02:33.100> actually<00:02:33.400> like

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:33.580 
as they're not actually like

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:35.070 
as they're not actually like
disintegrating<00:02:34.300> you<00:02:34.450> still<00:02:34.660> wanted<00:02:34.900> to<00:02:34.930> be<00:02:35.050> a

disintegrating you still wanted to be a

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:36.900 
disintegrating you still wanted to be a
little<00:02:35.350> bit<00:02:35.470> firm<00:02:35.709> so<00:02:35.890> that<00:02:36.070> they're<00:02:36.580> not<00:02:36.670> all

little bit firm so that they're not all
waterlogged<00:02:37.420> so<00:02:38.320> then<00:02:38.500> you<00:02:38.770> just<00:02:39.010> want<00:02:39.160> to

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:43.959 
milk I just use 1% milk because it's a

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:45.809 
milk I just use 1% milk because it's a
little<00:03:44.110> bit<00:03:44.409> healthier<00:03:45.250> especially<00:03:45.400> because

00:03:45.809 --> 00:03:45.819 
little bit healthier especially because

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:48.660 
little bit healthier especially because
I<00:03:45.970> use<00:03:46.120> sour<00:03:46.450> cream<00:03:46.659> in<00:03:46.840> here<00:03:47.430> but<00:03:48.430> you<00:03:48.549> can

I use sour cream in here but you can

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:50.160 
I use sour cream in here but you can
also<00:03:48.790> use<00:03:48.909> buttermilk<00:03:49.569> which<00:03:49.689> is<00:03:49.810> I<00:03:49.840> hope<00:03:50.079> a

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:50.170 
also use buttermilk which is I hope a

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:51.300 
also use buttermilk which is I hope a
healthier<00:03:50.530> or<00:03:50.680> you<00:03:50.799> can<00:03:50.950> use<00:03:51.069> whole<00:03:51.280> milk

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:51.310 
healthier or you can use whole milk

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:54.119 
healthier or you can use whole milk
which<00:03:51.670> is<00:03:51.819> a<00:03:51.849> little<00:03:52.120> bit<00:03:52.269> thicker<00:03:52.959> and<00:03:53.650> I<00:03:53.860> just

00:03:54.119 --> 00:03:54.129 
which is a little bit thicker and I just

00:03:54.129 --> 00:04:00.059 
which is a little bit thicker and I just
um<00:03:56.400> I<00:03:57.400> just<00:03:58.239> I<00:03:58.510> don't<00:03:58.870> measure<00:03:59.260> it<00:03:59.409> I<00:03:59.620> just<00:03:59.709> kind

00:04:00.059 --> 00:04:00.069 
um I just I don't measure it I just kind

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:03.539 
um I just I don't measure it I just kind
of<00:04:00.129> see<00:04:01.200> based<00:04:02.200> on<00:04:02.409> how<00:04:02.530> many<00:04:02.590> potatoes<00:04:03.159> I<00:04:03.340> have

00:04:03.539 --> 00:04:03.549 
of see based on how many potatoes I have

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:05.759 
of see based on how many potatoes I have
so<00:04:04.239> I'd<00:04:04.359> say<00:04:04.510> this<00:04:04.659> is<00:04:04.810> probably<00:04:05.019> like<00:04:05.319> a<00:04:05.470> third

00:04:05.759 --> 00:04:05.769 
so I'd say this is probably like a third

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:07.890 
so I'd say this is probably like a third
of<00:04:05.920> a<00:04:06.010> cup<00:04:06.189> you<00:04:06.970> don't<00:04:07.120> want<00:04:07.239> too<00:04:07.480> much<00:04:07.629> milk

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:07.900 
of a cup you don't want too much milk

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:09.360 
of a cup you don't want too much milk
because<00:04:08.109> if<00:04:08.230> you<00:04:08.379> use<00:04:08.560> too<00:04:08.769> much<00:04:08.799> milk<00:04:09.099> it'll

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:09.370 
because if you use too much milk it'll

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:11.910 
because if you use too much milk it'll
make<00:04:09.549> your<00:04:09.670> potatoes<00:04:10.090> gummy<00:04:10.390> and<00:04:10.720> that<00:04:11.650> is

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:11.920 
make your potatoes gummy and that is

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:15.420 
make your potatoes gummy and that is
gross<00:04:12.989> so<00:04:13.989> now<00:04:14.079> I'm<00:04:14.200> gonna<00:04:14.349> use<00:04:14.440> garlic<00:04:14.829> I<00:04:15.159> just
