touch each other at 15 feet so that's

you're going to need to map out your
yard<00:05:12.060> you're<00:05:12.600> going<00:05:12.750> to<00:05:12.810> want<00:05:12.960> to<00:05:13.020> take<00:05:13.200> a<00:05:13.230> tape

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:13.530 
yard you're going to want to take a tape

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:15.560 
yard you're going to want to take a tape
measure<00:05:13.560> and<00:05:14.100> you're<00:05:14.640> depending<00:05:15.330> on<00:05:15.450> the

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:15.570 
measure and you're depending on the

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:17.390 
measure and you're depending on the
shape<00:05:15.810> of<00:05:15.960> your<00:05:16.020> yard<00:05:16.350> you'll<00:05:16.530> see<00:05:16.770> in<00:05:16.890> the

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:17.400 
shape of your yard you'll see in the

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:20.750 
shape of your yard you'll see in the
samples<00:05:17.850> that<00:05:18.090> you<00:05:18.630> know<00:05:18.750> that<00:05:19.560> I've<00:05:19.920> shown

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:20.760 
samples that you know that I've shown

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:23.750 
samples that you know that I've shown
yards<00:05:21.510> that<00:05:21.630> are<00:05:21.930> just<00:05:22.290> have<00:05:22.890> strange<00:05:23.430> shapes

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:23.760 
yards that are just have strange shapes

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:26.000 
yards that are just have strange shapes
and<00:05:24.030> you<00:05:24.780> got<00:05:24.900> to<00:05:25.050> figure<00:05:25.200> out<00:05:25.350> what's<00:05:25.800> the

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:26.010 
and you got to figure out what's the

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:27.710 
and you got to figure out what's the
best<00:05:26.040> combination<00:05:26.880> of<00:05:27.030> sprinklers<00:05:27.480> because

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:27.720 
best combination of sprinklers because

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:29.720 
best combination of sprinklers because
it's<00:05:27.840> really<00:05:27.990> up<00:05:28.230> to<00:05:28.380> you<00:05:28.500> it's<00:05:28.710> your<00:05:28.800> yard<00:05:29.190> you

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:29.730 
it's really up to you it's your yard you

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:32.120 
it's really up to you it's your yard you
know<00:05:29.880> where<00:05:30.660> should<00:05:30.840> I<00:05:30.930> put<00:05:31.140> sprinklers<00:05:31.680> here

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:32.130 
know where should I put sprinklers here

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:34.100 
know where should I put sprinklers here
they're<00:05:32.310> everywhere<00:05:32.910> in<00:05:33.120> order<00:05:33.570> to<00:05:33.840> get<00:05:33.990> the

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:34.110 
they're everywhere in order to get the

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:35.930 
they're everywhere in order to get the
best<00:05:34.260> coverage<00:05:34.680> so<00:05:34.920> I<00:05:34.950> don't<00:05:35.160> have<00:05:35.280> bare<00:05:35.550> spots

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:35.940 
best coverage so I don't have bare spots

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:37.670 
best coverage so I don't have bare spots
and<00:05:36.270> I<00:05:36.330> don't<00:05:36.390> have<00:05:36.630> spots<00:05:36.960> when<00:05:37.200> I'm<00:05:37.290> watering

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:37.680 
and I don't have spots when I'm watering

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:39.530 
and I don't have spots when I'm watering
stuff<00:05:38.310> that<00:05:38.460> I<00:05:38.490> don't<00:05:38.760> want<00:05:38.880> to<00:05:38.940> be<00:05:39.030> watering

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:44.070 
very effective coverage and you need to

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:45.980 
very effective coverage and you need to
figure<00:05:44.280> out<00:05:44.430> where<00:05:44.880> each<00:05:45.120> sprinkler<00:05:45.660> head<00:05:45.840> is

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:45.990 
figure out where each sprinkler head is

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:49.100 
figure out where each sprinkler head is
going<00:05:46.350> to<00:05:46.380> go<00:05:46.680> before<00:05:47.610> you<00:05:47.970> can<00:05:48.150> lay<00:05:48.360> your<00:05:48.390> PVC

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:49.110 
going to go before you can lay your PVC

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:51.170 
going to go before you can lay your PVC
pipe<00:05:49.350> grid<00:05:49.620> or<00:05:49.830> dig<00:05:50.400> your<00:05:50.550> trenches<00:05:51.000> because

pipe grid or dig your trenches because

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:53.090 
pipe grid or dig your trenches because
you're<00:05:51.720> not<00:05:51.840> knowing<00:05:52.200> you<00:05:52.530> don't<00:05:52.680> know<00:05:52.890> yet

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:53.100 
you're not knowing you don't know yet

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:54.290 
you're not knowing you don't know yet
where<00:05:53.280> you're<00:05:53.430> going<00:05:53.580> to<00:05:53.640> dig<00:05:53.820> a<00:05:53.850> trench<00:05:54.150> to

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:54.300 
where you're going to dig a trench to

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:57.230 
where you're going to dig a trench to
because<00:05:54.900> the<00:05:55.080> trench<00:05:55.350> needs<00:05:55.650> to<00:05:55.950> end<00:05:56.250> up<00:05:56.940> at<00:05:57.210> a

00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:57.240 
because the trench needs to end up at a

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:58.850 
because the trench needs to end up at a
place<00:05:57.480> where<00:05:57.870> a<00:05:57.930> sprinkler<00:05:58.470> is<00:05:58.590> going<00:05:58.800> to

00:05:58.850 --> 00:05:58.860 
place where a sprinkler is going to

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:00.740 
place where a sprinkler is going to
going<00:05:59.370> to<00:05:59.430> rise<00:05:59.610> up<00:05:59.850> from<00:05:59.910> the<00:06:00.240> ground<00:06:00.450> and<00:06:00.630> be

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:00.750 
going to rise up from the ground and be

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:02.870 
going to rise up from the ground and be
able<00:06:00.930> to<00:06:01.050> water<00:06:01.260> so<00:06:01.770> that's<00:06:01.950> that's<00:06:02.400> the<00:06:02.640> step

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:02.880 
able to water so that's that's the step

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:04.640 
able to water so that's that's the step
that<00:06:03.060> you<00:06:03.210> need<00:06:03.240> to<00:06:03.540> do<00:06:03.660> now<00:06:03.870> before<00:06:04.110> you<00:06:04.440> can

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:04.650 
that you need to do now before you can

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:06.680 
that you need to do now before you can
move<00:06:04.800> on<00:06:05.010> to<00:06:05.100> the<00:06:05.190> next<00:06:05.550> step<00:06:05.760> which<00:06:06.000> is<00:06:06.030> how<00:06:06.660> to

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:06.690 
move on to the next step which is how to

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:08.870 
move on to the next step which is how to
actually<00:06:07.350> install<00:06:07.620> a<00:06:07.770> PVC<00:06:08.220> pipe<00:06:08.400> grid

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:08.880 
actually install a PVC pipe grid

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:11.720 
actually install a PVC pipe grid
underground<00:06:09.360> and<00:06:09.570> how<00:06:10.050> to<00:06:10.110> inner<00:06:10.730> interphase

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:11.730 
underground and how to inner interphase

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:14.150 
underground and how to inner interphase
it<00:06:12.000> so<00:06:12.180> that<00:06:12.390> a<00:06:12.630> sprinkler<00:06:13.290> can<00:06:13.500> actually<00:06:13.919> come

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:14.160 
it so that a sprinkler can actually come

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:17.000 
it so that a sprinkler can actually come
up<00:06:14.190> from<00:06:14.640> the<00:06:14.820> underground<00:06:15.690> pipe<00:06:15.990> and<00:06:16.260> the<00:06:16.860> way

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:17.010 
up from the underground pipe and the way

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:18.800 
up from the underground pipe and the way
that's<00:06:17.250> most<00:06:17.490> effective<00:06:18.090> that's<00:06:18.330> the<00:06:18.480> easiest

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:18.810 
that's most effective that's the easiest

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:21.020 
that's most effective that's the easiest
to<00:06:19.050> fix<00:06:19.230> in<00:06:19.500> case<00:06:19.710> it<00:06:19.890> breaks<00:06:20.070> and<00:06:20.550> how<00:06:20.970> to

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:21.030 
to fix in case it breaks and how to

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:23.390 
to fix in case it breaks and how to
build<00:06:21.330> it<00:06:21.480> just<00:06:21.510> properly<00:06:22.140> so<00:06:22.530> do<00:06:23.040> that<00:06:23.160> now

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:23.400 
build it just properly so do that now

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:24.830 
build it just properly so do that now
and<00:06:23.610> then<00:06:23.730> before<00:06:23.910> the<00:06:24.180> next<00:06:24.330> video<00:06:24.630> we'll

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:24.840 
and then before the next video we'll

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:26.690 
and then before the next video we'll
talk<00:06:24.990> about<00:06:25.050> actually<00:06:25.740> how<00:06:25.830> to<00:06:25.860> interface<00:06:26.400> and

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:26.700 
talk about actually how to interface and

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:28.670 
talk about actually how to interface and
put<00:06:26.850> it<00:06:26.970> all<00:06:27.060> together<00:06:27.270> and<00:06:27.840> build<00:06:28.410> your<00:06:28.620> own

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:28.680 
put it all together and build your own

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:33.680 
put it all together and build your own
backyard<00:06:29.520> or<00:06:29.940> front<00:06:29.970> yard<00:06:30.419> sprinkler<00:06:31.290> system
