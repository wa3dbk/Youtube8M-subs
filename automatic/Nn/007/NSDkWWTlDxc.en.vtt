00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:07.589
 Hahaha, good people, I 'm here in mine. 

00:00:04.069 --> 00:00:10.019
 motorola motokey ex-motorcycle x 2013 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:12.360
 like the one to 2013 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.790
 here on set up on the phone 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.400
 baseband version you can read 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:20.310
 msm 89 sixty pro 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:23.070
 this is the sd4 snapdragon codename 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.560
 world's own processor x correct and 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:29.910
 here is the device code 221 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:32.250
 point 40 and 1.31 ghost and I just 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.680
 authorize it for android 5.0 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.680
 Correct lollipop on my prints 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:41.160
 about this new version of android is that 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:43.440
 in set up you have the motorcycle option here in 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.780
 motorcycle option has voice option and how do you 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:49.079
 can see has been totally reformulated such 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:53.520
 very similar to the flex 2014 engine 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:55.379
 if I say what motorex to him 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.190
 It will not work and I will. 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.690
 recording 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.989
 whenever you have to show some 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:07.560
 stuff for someone does not work 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:09.900
 anyway and motorola is not fair with 16 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.260
 gb of internal memory blah blah blah blah 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.260
 blah 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:17.460
 the news about pop oil that 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.290
 You know, there are few 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:23.490
 The more that you can see here the 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:25.080
 bike that used to be the smart screen 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.759
 voice control all scattered in the 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.710
 now everything is inside the 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:32.009
 moto 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:34.409
 I found it quite cool to audi 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:37.020
 It's still kit kat, which I thought was cool. 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.549
 because I like giving a shot to kitkat 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.900
 camera has been updated gallery has been 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.520
 updated google apps 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.619
 were updated 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.000
 the motorola application has been updated 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.950
 which is what I just showed you 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.659

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:54.299
 correct aetc 1 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:59.310
 At first the ticket was quite 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:02:03.409
 fluid in motorola moto x dop 5.0 point 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:05.509
 2 the official final nothing custom with 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:07.520
 without any led without any type of 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:13.819
 problem 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:17.530
 let's close that at first this 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:20.959
 People, I more or less just wanted to 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:22.970
 calm first preview there while 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:24.560

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:26.420
 correct 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:29.390
 wanted to give a first preview of 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:31.910
 how of how things 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:34.310
 at first everything is very fluid 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:37.280
 Thank God the motorola took a while but did 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:40.579
 a pop made a Russian handset made a pit 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:42.739
 fairly interesting and if you 

00:02:40.579 --> 00:02:44.540
 enjoyed the video night keyboard 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:46.459
 while my mother is taking a shower 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:49.160

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:52.819
