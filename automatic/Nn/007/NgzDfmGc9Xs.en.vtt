00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:06.570 
hey this is darkened for this tutorial

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:08.180 
hey this is darkened for this tutorial
I'm<00:00:06.930> going<00:00:06.960> to<00:00:07.170> be<00:00:07.260> showing<00:00:07.440> you<00:00:07.680> how<00:00:07.710> to<00:00:07.860> paint

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:08.190 
I'm going to be showing you how to paint

00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:10.250 
I'm going to be showing you how to paint
wood<00:00:08.639> or<00:00:09.240> actually<00:00:09.720> I<00:00:09.750> guess<00:00:09.900> it's

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
wood or actually I guess it's

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.620 
wood or actually I guess it's
technically<00:00:10.650> called<00:00:10.770> lumber<00:00:11.370> since<00:00:11.639> it's<00:00:11.850> cut

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
technically called lumber since it's cut

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.200 
technically called lumber since it's cut
into<00:00:12.930> a<00:00:12.960> plank<00:00:13.230> but<00:00:13.620> anyway<00:00:14.610> so<00:00:14.670> i'm<00:00:14.880> using

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
into a plank but anyway so i'm using

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.050 
into a plank but anyway so i'm using
this<00:00:16.130> textured<00:00:17.130> brush<00:00:17.369> that<00:00:17.520> I<00:00:17.580> got<00:00:17.760> from<00:00:17.880> one

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
this textured brush that I got from one

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.220 
this textured brush that I got from one
of<00:00:18.119> my<00:00:18.180> friends<00:00:18.210> and<00:00:18.930> I'm<00:00:19.800> just<00:00:20.040> painting<00:00:20.640> in

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:21.230 
of my friends and I'm just painting in

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:25.490 
of my friends and I'm just painting in
photoshop<00:00:22.279> cs3<00:00:23.279> and<00:00:23.759> I'm<00:00:24.599> just<00:00:24.840> blocking<00:00:25.140> in

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
photoshop cs3 and I'm just blocking in

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.089 
photoshop cs3 and I'm just blocking in
the<00:00:25.529> main<00:00:26.009> shape<00:00:26.310> of<00:00:26.640> the<00:00:26.849> plank<00:00:27.150> right<00:00:27.419> now

00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:28.099 
the main shape of the plank right now

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:31.300 
the main shape of the plank right now
using<00:00:29.099> a<00:00:29.400> little<00:00:30.270> bit<00:00:30.419> of<00:00:30.509> a<00:00:30.570> desaturated

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:31.310 
using a little bit of a desaturated

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:36.529 
using a little bit of a desaturated
orangish<00:00:32.310> color<00:00:35.030> and<00:00:36.030> when<00:00:36.210> you're<00:00:36.329> painting

00:00:36.529 --> 00:00:36.539 
orangish color and when you're painting

00:00:36.539 --> 00:00:38.689 
orangish color and when you're painting
what<00:00:37.079> one<00:00:37.500> of<00:00:37.590> the<00:00:37.649> things<00:00:37.800> to<00:00:38.039> think<00:00:38.190> about<00:00:38.309> is

00:00:38.689 --> 00:00:38.699 
what one of the things to think about is

00:00:38.699 --> 00:00:44.450 
what one of the things to think about is
the<00:00:39.440> shape<00:00:40.440> of<00:00:40.620> it<00:00:40.739> and<00:00:41.870> also<00:00:42.980> are<00:00:43.980> you<00:00:44.039> trying

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
the shape of it and also are you trying

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.090 
the shape of it and also are you trying
to<00:00:44.550> paint<00:00:44.910> smooth<00:00:45.719> wood<00:00:45.989> or<00:00:46.379> textured<00:00:46.859> wood

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
to paint smooth wood or textured wood

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.150 
to paint smooth wood or textured wood
like<00:00:47.600> what<00:00:48.600> is<00:00:48.719> the<00:00:48.839> purpose<00:00:49.109> of<00:00:49.500> this<00:00:49.620> in<00:00:50.039> your

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
like what is the purpose of this in your

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.130 
like what is the purpose of this in your
illustration<00:00:50.760> and<00:00:51.449> for<00:00:51.690> this<00:00:51.780> one<00:00:51.899> I<00:00:51.929> just

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
illustration and for this one I just

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.259 
illustration and for this one I just
wanted<00:00:52.379> to<00:00:52.410> do<00:00:52.620> a<00:00:52.649> really<00:00:53.010> rough<00:00:53.489> textured

00:00:54.259 --> 00:00:54.269 
wanted to do a really rough textured

00:00:54.269 --> 00:00:58.279 
wanted to do a really rough textured
plank<00:00:55.019> of<00:00:55.140> wood<00:00:56.149> so<00:00:57.149> i'm<00:00:57.269> using<00:00:57.629> this<00:00:57.780> textured

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
plank of wood so i'm using this textured

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.869 
plank of wood so i'm using this textured
brush<00:00:59.899> and<00:01:00.899> the<00:01:01.589> thing<00:01:01.739> about<00:01:01.769> what<00:01:02.100> is<00:01:02.249> it<00:01:02.699> has

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
brush and the thing about what is it has

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.899 
brush and the thing about what is it has
a<00:01:02.909> lot<00:01:03.210> of<00:01:03.239> different<00:01:03.390> things<00:01:04.220> going<00:01:05.220> on<00:01:05.580> in<00:01:05.790> it

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
a lot of different things going on in it

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:11.330 
a lot of different things going on in it
has<00:01:06.590> lots<00:01:07.590> of<00:01:07.740> knots<00:01:08.720> splits<00:01:09.720> Nick's<00:01:10.650> little

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
has lots of knots splits Nick's little

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.840 
has lots of knots splits Nick's little
holes<00:01:12.140> so<00:01:13.140> adding<00:01:13.770> those<00:01:13.890> type<00:01:14.160> of<00:01:14.190> things<00:01:14.370> can

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
holes so adding those type of things can

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.630 
holes so adding those type of things can
really<00:01:14.880> help<00:01:15.500> sell<00:01:16.500> the<00:01:16.710> idea<00:01:16.860> that<00:01:17.130> this<00:01:17.460> is

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
really help sell the idea that this is

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.910 
really help sell the idea that this is
wood<00:01:17.910> that<00:01:18.090> you're<00:01:18.240> painting

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.990 

now<00:01:23.920> I'm<00:01:24.010> going<00:01:24.160> to<00:01:24.220> go<00:01:24.370> in<00:01:24.520> with<00:01:24.640> a<00:01:24.700> lighter

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:25.000 
now I'm going to go in with a lighter

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.460 
now I'm going to go in with a lighter
color<00:01:25.120> I'm<00:01:25.540> going<00:01:25.570> to<00:01:25.870> start<00:01:27.150> pulling<00:01:28.150> out

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
color I'm going to start pulling out

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.170 
color I'm going to start pulling out
some<00:01:29.470> of<00:01:29.650> these<00:01:29.860> edges<00:01:30.400> along<00:01:30.640> the<00:01:30.850> splits

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:31.180 
some of these edges along the splits

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:34.050 
some of these edges along the splits
usually<00:01:31.750> when<00:01:31.900> you<00:01:31.990> have<00:01:32.230> a<00:01:32.580> split<00:01:33.580> in<00:01:33.790> a<00:01:33.880> piece

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:34.060 
usually when you have a split in a piece

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:36.900 
usually when you have a split in a piece
of<00:01:34.090> wood<00:01:34.500> the<00:01:35.500> edges<00:01:36.250> of<00:01:36.400> it<00:01:36.460> are<00:01:36.610> going<00:01:36.760> to<00:01:36.820> be

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:36.910 
of wood the edges of it are going to be

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:41.100 
of wood the edges of it are going to be
lighter<00:01:37.180> than<00:01:37.530> the<00:01:38.530> rest<00:01:38.770> of<00:01:38.920> the<00:01:39.070> wood<00:01:40.110> and

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:41.110 
lighter than the rest of the wood and

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:43.890 
lighter than the rest of the wood and
I'm<00:01:41.290> also<00:01:41.440> trying<00:01:41.740> to<00:01:42.070> add<00:01:42.460> in<00:01:43.270> some<00:01:43.510> sharper

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:43.900 
I'm also trying to add in some sharper

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:47.250 
I'm also trying to add in some sharper
edges<00:01:44.050> since<00:01:44.830> it's<00:01:45.520> pretty<00:01:45.820> rough<00:01:46.260> the

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:47.260 
edges since it's pretty rough the

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:48.600 
edges since it's pretty rough the
textured<00:01:47.650> brush<00:01:47.890> made<00:01:48.100> it<00:01:48.220> a<00:01:48.250> little<00:01:48.370> fuzzy

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:48.610 
textured brush made it a little fuzzy

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:50.040 
textured brush made it a little fuzzy
around<00:01:48.820> the<00:01:48.970> edges<00:01:49.030> and<00:01:49.450> things<00:01:49.690> so<00:01:49.840> I'm<00:01:49.930> just

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:50.050 
around the edges and things so I'm just

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:52.500 
around the edges and things so I'm just
going<00:01:50.860> in<00:01:51.100> and<00:01:51.280> sharpening<00:01:51.670> those<00:01:51.850> areas<00:01:52.240> up<00:01:52.420> a

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:52.510 
going in and sharpening those areas up a

00:01:52.510 --> 00:02:00.160 
going in and sharpening those areas up a
little<00:01:52.720> bit

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.170 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:16.620 

you

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:16.630 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:19.050 

now<00:02:17.440> the<00:02:17.500> reason<00:02:17.710> I'm<00:02:18.010> painting<00:02:18.400> this<00:02:18.670> all<00:02:18.910> by

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
now the reason I'm painting this all by

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.020 
now the reason I'm painting this all by
hand<00:02:19.270> and<00:02:19.510> not<00:02:19.660> using<00:02:20.170> an<00:02:20.290> e<00:02:20.440> in<00:02:21.030> Photoshop

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
hand and not using an e in Photoshop

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.980 
hand and not using an e in Photoshop
filters<00:02:22.930> or<00:02:23.760> tricks<00:02:24.760> or<00:02:25.000> photo<00:02:25.390> /<00:02:25.690> lives<00:02:25.870> or

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:25.990 
filters or tricks or photo / lives or

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:29.580 
filters or tricks or photo / lives or
anything<00:02:26.260> is<00:02:26.380> because<00:02:26.500> I<00:02:27.390> tend<00:02:28.390> to<00:02:28.630> not<00:02:29.260> use

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
anything is because I tend to not use

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:31.050 
anything is because I tend to not use
any<00:02:29.770> of<00:02:29.860> those<00:02:30.010> types<00:02:30.250> of<00:02:30.370> things<00:02:30.430> I<00:02:30.730> usually

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
any of those types of things I usually

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.630 
any of those types of things I usually
just<00:02:31.120> paint<00:02:31.450> everything<00:02:31.690> by<00:02:31.990> hand<00:02:32.350> I<00:02:32.650> I<00:02:33.280> was

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
just paint everything by hand I I was

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.540 
just paint everything by hand I I was
trained<00:02:34.270> traditionally<00:02:34.930> in<00:02:35.230> oils<00:02:36.220> and

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:36.550 
trained traditionally in oils and

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:40.290 
trained traditionally in oils and
watercolors<00:02:37.510> and<00:02:38.280> just<00:02:39.280> traditional<00:02:40.000> media

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:40.300 
watercolors and just traditional media

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:43.950 
watercolors and just traditional media
so<00:02:40.600> I<00:02:40.870> never<00:02:41.770> really<00:02:42.240> used<00:02:43.240> those<00:02:43.510> types<00:02:43.750> of

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:43.960 
so I never really used those types of

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:46.580 
so I never really used those types of
tricks<00:02:44.380> when<00:02:44.710> I<00:02:44.740> started<00:02:45.190> painting<00:02:45.850> digitally

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
tricks when I started painting digitally

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:49.230 
tricks when I started painting digitally
like<00:02:47.590> I<00:02:47.710> just<00:02:47.950> always<00:02:48.100> painted<00:02:48.610> everything<00:02:48.850> by

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:49.240 
like I just always painted everything by

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:56.950 
like I just always painted everything by
hand

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:56.960 

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:06.870 

you

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:06.880 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.340 

I'm<00:03:07.880> going<00:03:08.090> back<00:03:08.180> in<00:03:08.510> now<00:03:08.540> and<00:03:08.870> adding<00:03:09.200> in<00:03:09.320> some

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:09.350 
I'm going back in now and adding in some

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:11.920 
I'm going back in now and adding in some
little<00:03:09.650> holes<00:03:09.980> and<00:03:10.310> some<00:03:10.580> Nicks<00:03:11.210> and<00:03:11.480> splits

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 
little holes and some Nicks and splits

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:14.680 
little holes and some Nicks and splits
in<00:03:12.020> the<00:03:12.110> wooden<00:03:12.440> those<00:03:12.860> things<00:03:13.130> and<00:03:13.430> then<00:03:13.760> once

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:14.690 
in the wooden those things and then once

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:16.450 
in the wooden those things and then once
I<00:03:14.810> have<00:03:14.960> the<00:03:15.110> dark<00:03:15.290> areas<00:03:15.650> of<00:03:15.860> the<00:03:16.010> split<00:03:16.310> or

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:16.460 
I have the dark areas of the split or

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:18.390 
I have the dark areas of the split or
the<00:03:16.550> whole<00:03:16.730> that<00:03:16.970> I'm<00:03:17.090> adding<00:03:17.600> in<00:03:17.750> little

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
the whole that I'm adding in little

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:27.800 
the whole that I'm adding in little
highlights<00:03:19.400> around<00:03:19.910> the<00:03:19.970> edges

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:44.530 

you

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:44.540 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:46.550 

I'm<00:03:45.540> thinking<00:03:45.780> that<00:03:46.050> this<00:03:46.140> piece<00:03:46.380> of<00:03:46.530> wood

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
I'm thinking that this piece of wood

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.190 
I'm thinking that this piece of wood
could<00:03:46.950> be<00:03:47.220> like<00:03:47.790> in<00:03:47.910> an<00:03:48.000> old<00:03:48.270> house<00:03:48.540> or<00:03:48.930> maybe

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.200 
could be like in an old house or maybe

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.980 
could be like in an old house or maybe
it's<00:03:49.500> part<00:03:50.400> of<00:03:50.490> like<00:03:50.670> an<00:03:50.820> old<00:03:51.030> ship<00:03:51.810> or

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:51.990 
it's part of like an old ship or

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:54.890 
it's part of like an old ship or
something<00:03:52.350> that's<00:03:52.500> why<00:03:52.740> it's<00:03:53.040> so<00:03:53.870> beat<00:03:54.870> up

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:54.900 
something that's why it's so beat up

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:59.150 
something that's why it's so beat up
looking<00:03:55.500> and<00:03:55.760> rough<00:03:57.620> there's<00:03:58.620> lots<00:03:58.740> of<00:03:58.920> little

00:03:59.150 --> 00:03:59.160 
looking and rough there's lots of little

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:03.860 
looking and rough there's lots of little
pieces<00:03:59.430> of<00:03:59.610> damage<00:04:00.030> on<00:04:00.210> it<00:04:00.360> and<00:04:00.540> all<00:04:00.660> that<00:04:02.870> so

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:03.870 
pieces of damage on it and all that so

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:05.450 
pieces of damage on it and all that so
right<00:04:04.020> now<00:04:04.050> I'm<00:04:04.290> duplicating<00:04:04.890> the<00:04:05.010> background

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:05.460 
right now I'm duplicating the background

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:07.970 
right now I'm duplicating the background
and<00:04:05.760> I'm<00:04:05.970> setting<00:04:06.450> it<00:04:06.540> to<00:04:06.780> overlay<00:04:07.260> just<00:04:07.650> to

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:07.980 
and I'm setting it to overlay just to

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:10.460 
and I'm setting it to overlay just to
darken<00:04:08.850> up<00:04:09.150> the<00:04:09.210> image<00:04:09.450> a<00:04:09.660> little<00:04:09.750> bit<00:04:10.020> and<00:04:10.290> it

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
darken up the image a little bit and it

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:12.110 
darken up the image a little bit and it
gives<00:04:10.680> it<00:04:10.770> a<00:04:10.860> little<00:04:10.980> more<00:04:11.250> saturation<00:04:11.820> as

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
gives it a little more saturation as

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:15.860 
gives it a little more saturation as
well<00:04:12.300> and<00:04:12.720> I'm<00:04:13.650> also<00:04:13.830> going<00:04:14.190> in<00:04:14.460> and<00:04:14.870> upping

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:15.870 
well and I'm also going in and upping

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:21.740 
well and I'm also going in and upping
the<00:04:15.990> saturation<00:04:20.030> I'm<00:04:21.030> at<00:04:21.180> a<00:04:21.209> new<00:04:21.510> layer<00:04:21.720> and

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:21.750 
the saturation I'm at a new layer and

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:24.230 
the saturation I'm at a new layer and
going<00:04:22.260> back<00:04:22.440> and<00:04:22.740> pulling<00:04:23.520> out<00:04:23.730> some<00:04:24.060> of<00:04:24.180> the

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.240 
going back and pulling out some of the

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:27.020 
going back and pulling out some of the
lighter<00:04:24.480> areas<00:04:24.570> since<00:04:25.170> the<00:04:25.620> overlay<00:04:26.610> made

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:27.030 
lighter areas since the overlay made

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:35.450 
lighter areas since the overlay made
everything<00:04:27.300> darker

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:35.460 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:54.050 

you

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:54.060 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:56.120 

I'm<00:04:54.570> going<00:04:54.690> to<00:04:54.810> fix<00:04:54.960> this<00:04:55.080> bottom<00:04:55.590> part<00:04:55.740> heroes

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:56.130 
I'm going to fix this bottom part heroes

00:04:56.130 --> 00:05:00.170

too<00:04:57.120> much<00:04:57.450> of<00:04:57.690> a<00:04:57.780> weird<00:04:58.020> angle<00:04:58.940> I'm<00:04:59.940> just<00:05:00.030> going

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:00.180 
too much of a weird angle I'm just going

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:09.270 
too much of a weird angle I'm just going
to<00:05:00.240> try<00:05:00.389> and<00:05:00.419> level<00:05:01.230> it<00:05:01.350> out<00:05:01.530> a<00:05:01.560> little<00:05:01.800> bit

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:09.280 

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:51.620

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:53.870 

the<00:05:52.590> wood<00:05:52.710> is<00:05:52.740> still<00:05:53.070> looking<00:05:53.280> a<00:05:53.400> little<00:05:53.520> dull

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:53.880 
the wood is still looking a little dull

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:56.210 
the wood is still looking a little dull
and<00:05:54.180> not<00:05:55.170> enough<00:05:55.320> contrast<00:05:55.710> so<00:05:55.860> I'm<00:05:55.920> adding<00:05:56.070> a

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:56.220 
and not enough contrast so I'm adding a

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:57.650 
and not enough contrast so I'm adding a
new<00:05:56.340> layer<00:05:56.550> and<00:05:56.580> setting<00:05:56.970> that<00:05:57.060> to<00:05:57.210> overlay

00:05:57.650 --> 00:05:57.660 
new layer and setting that to overlay

00:05:57.660 --> 00:05:59.780 
new layer and setting that to overlay
and<00:05:57.870> i'm<00:05:58.470> going<00:05:58.620> to<00:05:58.680> pick<00:05:58.830> a<00:05:58.890> more<00:05:59.190> saturated

00:05:59.780 --> 00:05:59.790 
and i'm going to pick a more saturated

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:02.450 
and i'm going to pick a more saturated
reddish<00:06:00.450> orange<00:06:00.660> color<00:06:00.920> and<00:06:01.920> i'm<00:06:02.220> going<00:06:02.370> to

reddish orange color and i'm going to

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:06.350 
reddish orange color and i'm going to
paint<00:06:02.700> in<00:06:03.980> some<00:06:04.980> of<00:06:05.070> this<00:06:05.130> color<00:06:05.400> around<00:06:05.850> the

paint in some of this color around the

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:09.680 
paint in some of this color around the
middle<00:06:06.690> of<00:06:06.870> the<00:06:06.980> plank<00:06:07.980> a<00:06:08.390> lot<00:06:09.390> of<00:06:09.510> times

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:09.690 
middle of the plank a lot of times

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:12.800 
middle of the plank a lot of times
around<00:06:09.960> the<00:06:10.260> knots<00:06:10.530> and<00:06:11.330> just<00:06:12.330> towards<00:06:12.660> the

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:12.810 
around the knots and just towards the

around the knots and just towards the
middle<00:06:12.990> of<00:06:13.170> the<00:06:14.810> the<00:06:15.810> splits<00:06:16.200> it's<00:06:16.920> going<00:06:17.160> to

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:17.190 
middle of the the splits it's going to

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:19.640 
middle of the the splits it's going to
be<00:06:17.670> darker<00:06:18.420> and<00:06:18.540> more<00:06:18.570> saturated<00:06:19.080> and<00:06:19.410> then

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:19.650 
be darker and more saturated and then

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:22.040 
be darker and more saturated and then
the<00:06:20.520> edges<00:06:20.850> of<00:06:20.880> the<00:06:21.060> splits<00:06:21.540> are<00:06:21.690> going<00:06:21.840> to<00:06:21.900> be

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:22.050 
the edges of the splits are going to be

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:25.550 
the edges of the splits are going to be
a<00:06:22.080> little<00:06:22.350> bit<00:06:22.500> lighter<00:06:22.790> and<00:06:24.200> for<00:06:25.200> the<00:06:25.350> lighter

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:25.560 
a little bit lighter and for the lighter

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:27.170 
a little bit lighter and for the lighter
part<00:06:25.860> i<00:06:25.980> just<00:06:26.160> added<00:06:26.280> another<00:06:26.490> layer<00:06:26.910> and<00:06:27.090> i

00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:27.180 
part i just added another layer and i

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:29.860 
part i just added another layer and i
set<00:06:27.390> that<00:06:27.420> to<00:06:27.690> color<00:06:27.900> dodge<00:06:28.170> and<00:06:28.500> i'm<00:06:29.100> using<00:06:29.520> a

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:29.870 
set that to color dodge and i'm using a

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:33.320 
set that to color dodge and i'm using a
metal<00:06:30.870> tone<00:06:31.110> grey<00:06:31.530> to<00:06:32.250> paint<00:06:32.790> in<00:06:32.940> the<00:06:33.060> lights

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:33.330 
metal tone grey to paint in the lights

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:37.790 
metal tone grey to paint in the lights
now<00:06:35.420> it<00:06:36.420> also<00:06:36.540> depends<00:06:36.990> on<00:06:37.140> you<00:06:37.530> know<00:06:37.620> what

00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:37.800 
now it also depends on you know what

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:40.460 
now it also depends on you know what
type<00:06:37.980> of<00:06:38.010> wood<00:06:38.460> you're<00:06:38.640> trying<00:06:38.880> to<00:06:38.970> paint<00:06:39.470> so

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:40.470 
type of wood you're trying to paint so

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:43.610 
type of wood you're trying to paint so
you<00:06:40.530> may<00:06:40.950> not<00:06:41.100> want<00:06:41.400> it<00:06:41.490> to<00:06:41.730> be<00:06:42.080> the<00:06:43.080> saturated

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:43.620 
you may not want it to be the saturated

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:46.100 
you may not want it to be the saturated
or<00:06:43.890> this<00:06:44.100> bright<00:06:44.430> so<00:06:45.090> it<00:06:45.360> just<00:06:45.390> really<00:06:45.840> depends
