00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:07.020
 hello how am I kicker night and this is 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.150
 prism tutorials today we will see how 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.520
 import photos using bridge 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:14.400
 here as you can see I got stuck in my 

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:16.289
 sd memory card I will come to this 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.449
 button here that is called getting photos 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.609
 of the camera and I will click is us 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:23.519
 will display this menu in which I can in 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:25.109
 this tab choose my sd card the 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.640
 camera with what you have if it does not appear 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.880
 being able to be down here is going to update 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.560
 list is valid here you see that it comes out my 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.480
 photos already but imagine that does not come out 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.280
 it's because down here on this button 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.520
 here you do not have activated box 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:41.329
 advanced dialog click on it and already 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.920
 you can see your pictures worth 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:46.320
 here I have all the ones that I have in the 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.480
 card but imagine that I do not want 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.879
 import all of these here from the 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.670
 mount because I do not want to import the only 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.940
 those of the girl so I'm going to choose the 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:59.600
 first of which I do not want to import 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:01.550
 and the last one and you get hit me 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.710
 I keep if from the first to the 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:06.110
 last and so I've selected them all 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:08.119
 now right button and disable 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:10.610
 selected in this way also 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:13.110
 I could activate the disable all etc 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:14.670
 deactivates selected 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.590
 You can also manually deactivate 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:20.010
 simply by clicking on each of 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:23.550
 them on the arrow is on the ub 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:25.770
 marc let's see now the options of 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:27.900
 saved the location is the folder 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.910
 where they are going to be saved I will go to 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.190
 desk and I'm going to create myself down here 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:35.030
 a new folder that is called then 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:37.790
 which is the name of the model 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:40.549
 and open you could also create your 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:42.440
 folders with this option here and good 

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:43.549
 change the name of the files this 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:46.280
 it is quite useful 

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:47.750
 you can put it by date by date more 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.460
 custom name whatever you want me 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:52.280
 I choose custom name I put a 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:54.380
 name and here next a number one 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.610
 series so in this case I'm going to put one 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.340
 so that the series starts in one here 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:00.820
 you can see that that of l 0 0 0 1 the 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.770
 next will be 0 2 etc. 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.630
 if you think that the file of 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:06.790
 the camera you can choose here to keep 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:09.369
 the current file name in the 2x mp 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:11.350
 I do not put it does not seem necessary but 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:13.630
 well let's go to the advanced options 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:14.920
 here you have to open some british that 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:17.380
 it is simply to open them with 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.630
 british when importing will convert them from 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:21.550
 n &amp; g here you can see the settings that 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:23.080
 you can modify your way to 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:25.330
 those who do not know that the axis of the 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.950
 axis is the raw format like adobe 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:28.930
 what canon has hers that is tr2 or 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.850
 adobe has ng me always what 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:33.130
 I convert simply by having maximum 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:35.610
 compatibility with all programs 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:37.870
 of adobe just in case I leave it there 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:39.700
 I deleted original files this 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:41.770
 practically forbids you why it will be 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.270
 that your photos are deleted 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:44.709
 memory card once imported and 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:47.140
 it's not something I recommend it is not going to be 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:49.300
 If the import fails, you can also 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:50.709
 save copies when importing them on their own 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:52.600
 you want two places to cook 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:54.010
 time and here finally you have the 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.600
 metadata that we saw in the tutorial 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:57.550
 previous in case you want to apply a 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:00.190
 template of which you already have created 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:02.690
 for example prism tutorials and now 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:04.430
 All photos will be obtained 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:07.330
 with that template that we already had 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:07.330
 previously created 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:14.629
 ok this takes a while I pass it to camera 

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:17.510
 quick and here you have the pictures already 

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:20.480
 imported with the metadata as os 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:23.510
 I commented on all of them to begin with 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:25.519
 to edit them and select the ones I come from 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:26.959
 light table here does not bother me any 

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:29.659
 of the surrounding windows and I can 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:33.730
 see them all together and here the 

00:03:29.659 --> 00:03:33.730
 Larger size smaller to my liking 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:39.330
 with labeling them I mean what 

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:42.570
 next if you choose a photograph gone 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:44.940
 with command 6 for example it will be put 

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:47.710
 red color command 7 yellow color 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:49.420
 command 8 and command 9 

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:51.130
 to remove it I simply put 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:55.420
 over them and return to command 

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:57.370
 command 9 command 8 and it will be removed vale if 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:00.490
 we like colors another method is 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:04.270
 tag by star command 1 a 

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:06.280
 star command 2 command 3 command 4 and 

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:08.200
 command 5 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:12.180
 also to remove them are removed with 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:12.180
 command 0 command 0 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:16.769
 when to zero the command 0 with 2 0 and 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:18.479
 command 0 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:20.009
 to remove are all together what 

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:22.830
 I can do is select the first one and 

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:24.810
 the last one I put them all red 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:29.069
 institute of the red command six commands 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:30.599
 six is as I do it to choose 

00:04:29.069 --> 00:04:33.180
 the photos I want to edit once the 

00:04:30.599 --> 00:04:35.250
 imported I give a spacebar to 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:36.900
 see them in full screen and with the 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:39.530
 key on the right I'm going through all 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:43.050
 the pictures when I see one that I like 

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:45.060
 for idoia command 6 or the label of 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:47.370
 color you want to put and here as you see 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:49.680
 already that photo has the label because it is 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:52.590
 very happening when I see another that I like 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:53.940
 so I give him another label , be it red 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:56.699
 yellow each one can choose the 

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:58.470
 colors you want at your whim here 

00:04:56.699 --> 00:05:00.449
 I have all the other good I will give a 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:04.280
 couple of labels more roughly for 

00:05:00.449 --> 00:05:04.280
 what do you see as work 

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:08.410
 and now for all the rest 

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:10.330
 photographs that not chosen do not 

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:12.449
 bother I'll come to this tab 

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:14.949
 the star here and I'll choose 

00:05:12.449 --> 00:05:17.260
 show only tagged items 

00:05:14.949 --> 00:05:18.729
 in this way we will only see the 

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:20.740
 photographs that we have already selected and 

00:05:18.729 --> 00:05:22.960
 the others do not bother me with this 

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:24.760
 tab we can also show only the 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:27.430
 that have x stars or those that are 

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:29.139
 without labels and so on, it's worth it now 

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:31.449
 just if the selection and I give 

00:05:29.139 --> 00:05:34.770
 open I will open a photoshop for 

00:05:31.449 --> 00:05:34.770
 start working with them 

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:39.660
 ok if all this brito is scared 

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:42.090
 because you think you do not have it in the 

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:44.040
 normal folders do not worry if 

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:45.900
 you come to the desk you can check that 

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:48.540
 is the folder that we had created with 

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:52.410
 the photographs and if we open it they are 

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:55.380
 all normal equally if we go back to 

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:58.270
 dove bridge we have them in the folder of 

00:05:55.380 --> 00:06:00.580
 desk of l 

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:03.630
 and they are still with their labels that 

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:03.630
 we had already created 

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:07.530

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:09.720

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:11.610
