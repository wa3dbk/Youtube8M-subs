00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:42.380 
fold it in thoroughly but gently so that

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:45.640 
fold it in thoroughly but gently so that
it<00:02:42.709> still<00:02:43.070> stays<00:02:43.400> nice<00:02:43.670> and<00:02:43.700> fluffy<00:02:44.650> then

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650 
it still stays nice and fluffy then

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.789 
it still stays nice and fluffy then
after<00:02:46.519> it's<00:02:46.750> folded<00:02:47.750> in<00:02:47.810> nicely<00:02:48.110> you<00:02:48.500> just

00:02:48.789 --> 00:02:48.799 
after it's folded in nicely you just

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:51.460 
after it's folded in nicely you just
pour<00:02:49.190> it<00:02:49.280> into<00:02:49.430> a<00:02:49.609> greased<00:02:50.150> casserole<00:02:50.959> dish

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.470 
pour it into a greased casserole dish

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:53.860 
pour it into a greased casserole dish
and<00:02:51.769> has<00:02:51.980> to<00:02:52.130> be<00:02:52.220> a<00:02:52.250> fairly<00:02:52.519> large<00:02:52.880> one<00:02:53.120> now<00:02:53.840> I

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
and has to be a fairly large one now I

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.860 
and has to be a fairly large one now I
know<00:02:54.019> this<00:02:54.380> does<00:02:54.590> look<00:02:54.769> full<00:02:55.190> but<00:02:56.120> actually<00:02:56.660> it

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
know this does look full but actually it

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:58.479 
know this does look full but actually it
does<00:02:57.049> puff<00:02:57.320> up<00:02:57.500> but<00:02:57.709> does<00:02:57.829> not<00:02:57.920> go<00:02:58.130> over<00:02:58.400> the

00:02:58.479 --> 00:02:58.489 
does puff up but does not go over the

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:00.280 
does puff up but does not go over the
edge<00:02:58.640> of<00:02:58.880> the<00:02:59.000> pan<00:02:59.239> so<00:02:59.510> it<00:02:59.630> actually<00:02:59.930> works<00:03:00.109> out

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.290 
edge of the pan so it actually works out

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:04.070 
edge of the pan so it actually works out
quite<00:03:00.440> nicely

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.490 

then<00:03:04.650> you're<00:03:04.860> going<00:03:05.010> to<00:03:05.070> put<00:03:05.280> it<00:03:05.400> into<00:03:05.790> a<00:03:06.500> 475

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
then you're going to put it into a 475

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.520 
then you're going to put it into a 475
degree<00:03:08.070> oven<00:03:08.280> for<00:03:08.870> ten<00:03:09.870> minutes

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
degree oven for ten minutes

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:17.540 
degree oven for ten minutes
at<00:03:11.280> first<00:03:13.580> and<00:03:15.590> then<00:03:16.590> after<00:03:16.860> ten<00:03:17.250> minutes

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:17.550 
at first and then after ten minutes

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:19.160 
at first and then after ten minutes
you'll<00:03:17.760> see<00:03:17.970> this<00:03:18.090> puff<00:03:18.450> this<00:03:18.780> actually

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
you'll see this puff this actually

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:21.230 
you'll see this puff this actually
puffed<00:03:19.380> up<00:03:19.560> quite<00:03:19.860> a<00:03:19.890> bit<00:03:20.100> you're<00:03:20.910> gonna<00:03:21.000> turn

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:21.240 
puffed up quite a bit you're gonna turn

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:23.270 
puffed up quite a bit you're gonna turn
the<00:03:21.390> heat<00:03:21.570> down<00:03:21.600> to<00:03:21.840> 400<00:03:22.530> degrees<00:03:22.770> Fahrenheit

and bake for an additional 25 minutes

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:43.340 
and bake for an additional 25 minutes
and<00:03:27.720> here's<00:03:28.050> the<00:03:28.230> final<00:03:28.470> result<00:03:42.200> this<00:03:43.200> is<00:03:43.260> a

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:43.350 
and here's the final result this is a
