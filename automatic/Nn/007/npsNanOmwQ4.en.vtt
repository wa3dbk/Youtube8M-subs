00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
you just can't really do anything but um

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.499 
you just can't really do anything but um
hopefully<00:01:52.500> that<00:01:52.979> a<00:01:53.009> the<00:01:53.850> producers<00:01:54.479> of

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
hopefully that a the producers of

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.600 
hopefully that a the producers of
treyarch<00:01:55.020> will<00:01:55.380> learn<00:01:55.950> from<00:01:55.979> everything

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
treyarch will learn from everything

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.030 
treyarch will learn from everything
that's<00:01:57.149> gone<00:01:57.360> wrong<00:01:57.689> with<00:01:58.259> modern<00:01:58.560> warfare<00:01:58.710> 2

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
that's gone wrong with modern warfare 2

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.490 
that's gone wrong with modern warfare 2
as<00:01:59.250> you<00:02:00.240> guys<00:02:00.479> probably<00:02:00.509> know<00:02:00.810> Black<00:02:01.079> Ops<00:02:01.290> is

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
as you guys probably know Black Ops is

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.410 
as you guys probably know Black Ops is
coming<00:02:01.860> sometime<00:02:02.430> this<00:02:02.729> november<00:02:03.149> i<00:02:03.210> think

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
coming sometime this november i think

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.109 
coming sometime this november i think
it's<00:02:03.509> november<00:02:03.990> nine<00:02:04.140> not<00:02:04.619> really<00:02:04.829> sure<00:02:05.119> but

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
it's november nine not really sure but

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.719 
it's november nine not really sure but
um<00:02:06.299> I<00:02:06.570> want<00:02:07.290> to<00:02:07.350> know<00:02:07.439> what<00:02:07.740> would<00:02:07.920> be<00:02:08.369> some<00:02:08.610> of

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
um I want to know what would be some of

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.740 
um I want to know what would be some of
your<00:02:08.849> requests<00:02:09.239> for<00:02:09.390> black<00:02:09.569> ops<00:02:09.750> I<00:02:10.050> mean

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750 
your requests for black ops I mean

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:12.600 
your requests for black ops I mean
obviously<00:02:11.590> modern<00:02:11.830> warfare<00:02:11.950> 2<00:02:12.280> is<00:02:12.430> in<00:02:12.580> a

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
obviously modern warfare 2 is in a

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:15.210 
obviously modern warfare 2 is in a
perfect<00:02:13.000> game<00:02:13.150> and<00:02:13.500> black<00:02:14.500> ops<00:02:14.710> won't<00:02:15.130> be

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
perfect game and black ops won't be

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.970 
perfect game and black ops won't be
either<00:02:15.370> but<00:02:16.150> one<00:02:16.720> thing<00:02:17.020> the<00:02:17.230> treyarch<00:02:17.620> should

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
either but one thing the treyarch should

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.040 
either but one thing the treyarch should
do<00:02:18.160> I<00:02:18.370> believe<00:02:18.850> to<00:02:19.000> prevent<00:02:19.330> that<00:02:19.480> is<00:02:19.750> to

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 
do I believe to prevent that is to

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:22.410 
do I believe to prevent that is to
release<00:02:20.410> of<00:02:20.530> beta<00:02:20.740> just<00:02:21.130> like<00:02:21.280> um<00:02:21.520> just<00:02:22.240> like<00:02:22.360> a

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
release of beta just like um just like a

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.840 
release of beta just like um just like a
bunny<00:02:23.260> did<00:02:23.500> with<00:02:23.650> Halo<00:02:23.890> Reach<00:02:23.920> they<00:02:24.550> released

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:24.850 
bunny did with Halo Reach they released

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:26.490 
bunny did with Halo Reach they released
a<00:02:24.940> beta<00:02:25.090> they<00:02:25.570> discovered<00:02:25.960> a<00:02:26.020> couple<00:02:26.290> things

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
a beta they discovered a couple things

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.370 
a beta they discovered a couple things
such<00:02:26.800> as<00:02:26.830> I'm<00:02:27.220> like<00:02:28.209> maybe<00:02:28.720> grenades<00:02:29.110> are<00:02:29.260> too

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380 
such as I'm like maybe grenades are too

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:32.160 
such as I'm like maybe grenades are too
powerful<00:02:29.590> or<00:02:30.100> armor<00:02:30.610> lock<00:02:30.790> is<00:02:31.090> a<00:02:31.330> little<00:02:32.050> bit

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
powerful or armor lock is a little bit

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:35.670 
powerful or armor lock is a little bit
ridiculous<00:02:32.410> but<00:02:32.740> on<00:02:33.120> one<00:02:34.120> thing<00:02:34.360> I<00:02:34.660> hope<00:02:35.020> that

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
ridiculous but on one thing I hope that

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:40.590 
ridiculous but on one thing I hope that
black<00:02:36.310> ops<00:02:36.580> does<00:02:37.240> the<00:02:38.220> Infinity<00:02:39.220> Ward<00:02:39.600> really

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:40.600 
black ops does the Infinity Ward really

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.020 
black ops does the Infinity Ward really
didn't<00:02:40.959> do<00:02:41.170> with<00:02:41.590> modern<00:02:42.010> warfare<00:02:42.160> 2<00:02:42.400> if<00:02:42.880> I

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
didn't do with modern warfare 2 if I

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:44.790 
didn't do with modern warfare 2 if I
would<00:02:43.150> say<00:02:43.239> to<00:02:43.300> make<00:02:43.420> a<00:02:43.450> couple<00:02:44.050> smaller<00:02:44.500> maps

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:44.800 
would say to make a couple smaller maps

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.729 
would say to make a couple smaller maps
because<00:02:45.010> all<00:02:45.310> the<00:02:45.430> maps<00:02:45.610> are<00:02:45.790> generally<00:02:46.330> very

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:46.739 
because all the maps are generally very

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:49.560 
because all the maps are generally very
very<00:02:47.739> big<00:02:48.310> in<00:02:48.430> this<00:02:48.550> game<00:02:48.760> like<00:02:49.000> one<00:02:49.390> of<00:02:49.420> my

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:49.570 
very big in this game like one of my

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:51.990 
very big in this game like one of my
favorite<00:02:49.959> maps<00:02:50.170> and<00:02:51.130> cod<00:02:51.580> forward<00:02:51.910> with

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
favorite maps and cod forward with

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.760 
favorite maps and cod forward with
shipment<00:02:52.360> because<00:02:52.780> the<00:02:53.050> spawns<00:02:53.320> were<00:02:53.470> really

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:53.770 
shipment because the spawns were really

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:55.680 
shipment because the spawns were really
well<00:02:53.920> or<00:02:54.400> the<00:02:54.670> spawns<00:02:54.910> were<00:02:55.030> really<00:02:55.239> good<00:02:55.450> I

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
well or the spawns were really good I

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:58.410 
well or the spawns were really good I
should<00:02:55.989> say<00:02:56.170> and<00:02:56.700> it<00:02:57.700> was<00:02:57.850> just<00:02:57.970> really<00:02:58.030> really

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 
should say and it was just really really

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:00.660 
should say and it was just really really
like<00:02:58.810> action<00:02:59.320> there<00:02:59.560> was<00:02:59.680> an<00:02:59.800> you<00:03:00.370> couldn't

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:00.670 
like action there was an you couldn't

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:01.800 
like action there was an you couldn't
camp<00:03:00.850> on<00:03:00.970> that<00:03:01.120> map<00:03:01.239> I<00:03:01.390> think<00:03:01.660> it<00:03:01.750> was

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
camp on that map I think it was

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:04.440 
camp on that map I think it was
literally<00:03:02.110> impossible<00:03:02.320> to<00:03:02.770> camp<00:03:03.010> on<00:03:03.450> shipment

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.450 
literally impossible to camp on shipment

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:06.720 
literally impossible to camp on shipment
and<00:03:04.630> they<00:03:05.560> tried<00:03:05.800> to<00:03:05.830> make<00:03:05.950> rust<00:03:06.340> but<00:03:06.640> the

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:06.730 
and they tried to make rust but the

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.840 
and they tried to make rust but the
spawns<00:03:07.000> are<00:03:07.180> just<00:03:07.380> God<00:03:08.380> got<00:03:08.920> awful<00:03:09.340> on<00:03:09.550> that

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:09.850 
spawns are just God got awful on that

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:12.240 
spawns are just God got awful on that
map<00:03:10.060> and<00:03:10.330> I'm<00:03:10.690> another<00:03:11.260> thing<00:03:11.350> that<00:03:12.040> I<00:03:12.130> hope

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.250 
map and I'm another thing that I hope

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:15.660 
map and I'm another thing that I hope
black<00:03:12.430> ops<00:03:12.700> fixes<00:03:13.209> is<00:03:13.450> on<00:03:13.890> maybe<00:03:14.890> do<00:03:15.459> something

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:15.670 
black ops fixes is on maybe do something

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:18.090 
black ops fixes is on maybe do something
about<00:03:15.850> the<00:03:16.030> killstreaks<00:03:16.860> because<00:03:17.860> in<00:03:17.980> this

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:18.100 
about the killstreaks because in this

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:19.580 
about the killstreaks because in this
game<00:03:18.160> they<00:03:18.489> are<00:03:18.549> incredibly<00:03:18.760> overpowered

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
game they are incredibly overpowered

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.229 
game they are incredibly overpowered
even<00:03:20.590> I<00:03:20.650> mean<00:03:20.980> like<00:03:21.100> a<00:03:21.130> seven<00:03:21.549> kill<00:03:21.760> streak<00:03:22.060> is

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:22.239 
even I mean like a seven kill streak is

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:25.590 
even I mean like a seven kill streak is
a<00:03:22.959> Harrier<00:03:23.739> that<00:03:24.010> if<00:03:24.100> you<00:03:24.220> have<00:03:24.340> a<00:03:24.370> team<00:03:24.670> if<00:03:25.420> you

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:25.600 
a Harrier that if you have a team if you

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:26.910 
a Harrier that if you have a team if you
have<00:03:25.630> an<00:03:25.780> opposing<00:03:26.200> team<00:03:26.350> that's<00:03:26.560> just<00:03:26.769> like

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:26.920 
have an opposing team that's just like

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:28.979 
have an opposing team that's just like
nonchalant<00:03:27.459> about<00:03:28.120> taking<00:03:28.720> down<00:03:28.840> the<00:03:28.930> air

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:28.989 
nonchalant about taking down the air

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:30.720 
nonchalant about taking down the air
support<00:03:29.350> that<00:03:29.799> hair<00:03:29.950> didn't<00:03:30.160> get<00:03:30.280> you<00:03:30.370> seven

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730 
support that hair didn't get you seven

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:33.660 
support that hair didn't get you seven
eight<00:03:30.820> nine<00:03:30.850> kills<00:03:31.299> and<00:03:32.310> even<00:03:33.310> a<00:03:33.370> lesser

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:33.670 
eight nine kills and even a lesser

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:36.630 
eight nine kills and even a lesser
killstreak<00:03:34.090> the<00:03:34.239> predator<00:03:34.810> missile<00:03:35.430> can<00:03:36.430> take

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:36.640 
killstreak the predator missile can take

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040 
in the comfort zone and you just see

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:43.229 
in the comfort zone and you just see
this<00:03:42.160> predator<00:03:42.549> missile<00:03:42.820> coming<00:03:43.000> out<00:03:43.120> of<00:03:43.150> the

this predator missile coming out of the

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:45.870 
this predator missile coming out of the
sky<00:03:43.450> and<00:03:43.750> the<00:03:44.470> blast<00:03:44.769> radius<00:03:44.890> on<00:03:45.370> that<00:03:45.519> if<00:03:45.730> you

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:45.880 
sky and the blast radius on that if you

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:49.289 
sky and the blast radius on that if you
include<00:03:46.540> Danger<00:03:47.290> Close<00:03:47.320> pro<00:03:47.769> is<00:03:48.299> basically

00:03:49.289 --> 00:03:49.299 
include Danger Close pro is basically

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:51.660 
include Danger Close pro is basically
like<00:03:49.329> a<00:03:49.510> super-sized<00:03:50.110> javelin<00:03:50.769> going<00:03:51.280> on<00:03:51.400> and

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:51.670 
like a super-sized javelin going on and

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:54.630 
like a super-sized javelin going on and
on<00:03:52.329> any<00:03:52.690> location<00:03:53.260> any<00:03:53.560> any<00:03:54.220> place<00:03:54.459> you<00:03:54.610> want

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:54.640 
on any location any any place you want

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:57.750 
on any location any any place you want
and<00:03:55.360> I'm<00:03:55.870> I<00:03:56.079> just<00:03:56.380> think<00:03:56.560> that<00:03:56.590> a<00:03:56.739> like<00:03:57.489> that's

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:57.760 
and I'm I just think that a like that's

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:01.289 
and I'm I just think that a like that's
why<00:03:57.910> I<00:03:57.940> use<00:03:58.030> that<00:03:58.390> kill<00:03:58.600> streak<00:03:58.810> because<00:04:00.000> 5<00:04:01.000> 7

00:04:01.289 --> 00:04:01.299 
why I use that kill streak because 5 7

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:03.539 
why I use that kill streak because 5 7
11<00:04:01.329> 5<00:04:01.750> 7<00:04:02.049> 9<00:04:02.079> are<00:04:02.410> probably<00:04:03.070> going<00:04:03.190> to<00:04:03.280> be<00:04:03.370> your

00:04:03.539 --> 00:04:03.549 
11 5 7 9 are probably going to be your

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:08.100 
11 5 7 9 are probably going to be your
best<00:04:04.030> bet<00:04:05.010> you<00:04:06.010> know<00:04:06.150> in<00:04:07.150> this<00:04:07.299> game<00:04:07.510> I<00:04:07.690> am

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:08.110 
best bet you know in this game I am

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:10.410 
best bet you know in this game I am
using<00:04:08.950> a<00:04:09.040> marathon<00:04:09.459> lightweight<00:04:09.820> ninja<00:04:10.090> setup

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:10.420 
using a marathon lightweight ninja setup

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:12.270 
using a marathon lightweight ninja setup
which<00:04:10.600> i<00:04:10.690> think<00:04:10.750> is<00:04:10.930> a<00:04:10.989> great<00:04:11.380> rushing<00:04:11.920> setup

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:12.280 
which i think is a great rushing setup

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:14.220 
which i think is a great rushing setup
you<00:04:12.850> could<00:04:13.000> interchange<00:04:13.269> lightweight<00:04:13.959> with<00:04:14.200> a

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:14.230 
you could interchange lightweight with a

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:15.780 
you could interchange lightweight with a
cold-blooded<00:04:14.799> if<00:04:15.280> you<00:04:15.370> wanted<00:04:15.579> to<00:04:15.670> be<00:04:15.760> a

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:15.790 
cold-blooded if you wanted to be a

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:19.050 
cold-blooded if you wanted to be a
little<00:04:16.090> bit<00:04:16.239> more<00:04:16.510> stealth<00:04:16.870> but<00:04:17.200> um<00:04:17.350> I<00:04:18.060> prefer

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:19.060 
little bit more stealth but um I prefer

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:20.460 
little bit more stealth but um I prefer
the<00:04:19.090> lightweight<00:04:19.510> because<00:04:19.660> I<00:04:19.989> can<00:04:20.109> get<00:04:20.229> around

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:20.470 
the lightweight because I can get around

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:22.740 
the lightweight because I can get around
a<00:04:20.680> lot<00:04:20.830> like<00:04:20.979> quicker<00:04:21.190> and<00:04:21.640> I'm<00:04:22.360> you<00:04:22.510> guys<00:04:22.630> are

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:22.750 
a lot like quicker and I'm you guys are

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:23.900 
a lot like quicker and I'm you guys are
probably<00:04:22.840> noticed<00:04:23.289> that<00:04:23.349> I<00:04:23.470> haven't

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:23.910 
probably noticed that I haven't

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:26.900 
probably noticed that I haven't
a<00:04:23.970> single<00:04:24.510> flag<00:04:24.780> in<00:04:25.080> this<00:04:25.290> game<00:04:25.500> and<00:04:25.710> I'm<00:04:26.640> not

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:26.910 
a single flag in this game and I'm not

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:28.430 
a single flag in this game and I'm not
saying<00:04:27.180> that<00:04:27.240> I'm<00:04:27.390> not<00:04:27.570> playing<00:04:27.930> domination

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:28.440 
saying that I'm not playing domination

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:30.980 
saying that I'm not playing domination
for<00:04:28.620> the<00:04:28.680> objective<00:04:29.160> but<00:04:29.460> the<00:04:29.880> fact<00:04:30.150> is<00:04:30.270> is<00:04:30.570> we

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:30.990 
for the objective but the fact is is we

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:34.190 
for the objective but the fact is is we
have<00:04:31.860> lost<00:04:32.160> one<00:04:32.580> flag<00:04:32.940> I<00:04:33.240> the<00:04:33.660> score<00:04:33.930> right<00:04:34.020> now

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:34.200 
have lost one flag I the score right now

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:36.590 
have lost one flag I the score right now
is<00:04:34.350> like<00:04:34.560> one<00:04:35.280> of<00:04:35.310> something<00:04:35.670> to<00:04:36.000> about<00:04:36.240> like

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:36.600 
is like one of something to about like

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:40.190 
is like one of something to about like
30<00:04:36.960> 40<00:04:37.470> so<00:04:38.220> we've<00:04:38.460> lost<00:04:38.700> about<00:04:38.880> one<00:04:39.420> flag<00:04:39.780> this

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:40.200 
30 40 so we've lost about one flag this

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:42.230 
30 40 so we've lost about one flag this
entire<00:04:40.590> game<00:04:40.830> and<00:04:41.040> when<00:04:41.610> you<00:04:41.700> control<00:04:42.060> two

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:42.240 
entire game and when you control two

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:43.730 
entire game and when you control two
flags<00:04:42.540> you<00:04:42.840> don't<00:04:43.080> want<00:04:43.260> to<00:04:43.320> go<00:04:43.380> take<00:04:43.560> the

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:43.740 
flags you don't want to go take the

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:46.130 
flags you don't want to go take the
third<00:04:43.920> flag<00:04:44.270> in<00:04:45.270> fact<00:04:45.480> we<00:04:45.600> were<00:04:45.690> getting<00:04:45.870> angry

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:46.140 
third flag in fact we were getting angry

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:48.830 
third flag in fact we were getting angry
at<00:04:46.230> our<00:04:46.320> teammates<00:04:46.680> from<00:04:47.180> caffeine<00:04:48.180> like

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:48.840 
at our teammates from caffeine like

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:50.390 
at our teammates from caffeine like
unnecessary<00:04:49.440> flags<00:04:49.680> for<00:04:49.860> holding<00:04:50.100> all<00:04:50.220> three

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:50.400 
unnecessary flags for holding all three

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:52.490 
unnecessary flags for holding all three
positions<00:04:50.820> so<00:04:51.420> we<00:04:51.570> basically<00:04:51.900> had<00:04:52.260> to<00:04:52.320> say

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:52.500 
positions so we basically had to say

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:56.720 
positions so we basically had to say
like<00:04:52.740> let<00:04:52.980> them<00:04:53.130> have<00:04:53.280> one<00:04:53.520> and<00:04:55.310> this<00:04:56.310> brings

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:56.730 
like let them have one and this brings

00:04:56.730 --> 00:05:00.020 
like let them have one and this brings
me<00:04:56.940> I<00:04:57.270> think<00:04:57.720> 21<00:04:57.930> my<00:04:58.230> final<00:04:58.770> points<00:04:59.070> is<00:04:59.220> what<00:04:59.970> do

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:00.030 
me I think 21 my final points is what do

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:02.810 
me I think 21 my final points is what do
you<00:05:00.120> think<00:05:00.360> the<00:05:00.510> future<00:05:00.870> of<00:05:01.200> the<00:05:01.820> modern

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:02.820 
you think the future of the modern

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:04.790 
you think the future of the modern

series is because that companies

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:09.170 
series is because that companies
basically<00:05:08.220> going<00:05:08.520> through<00:05:08.730> a<00:05:08.760> nightmare

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:09.180 
basically going through a nightmare

be tough to recover from that that's

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:24.530 
be tough to recover from that that's
like<00:05:22.050> a<00:05:22.260> company<00:05:23.040> losing<00:05:23.370> their<00:05:23.490> CEO<00:05:23.970> in<00:05:24.300> their

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:24.540 
like a company losing their CEO in their

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:26.000 
like a company losing their CEO in their
CFO<00:05:24.840> that's<00:05:25.200> going<00:05:25.350> to<00:05:25.410> be<00:05:25.500> like<00:05:25.620> that's<00:05:25.890> gonna

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:26.010 
CFO that's going to be like that's gonna

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:28.160 
CFO that's going to be like that's gonna
be<00:05:26.130> hard<00:05:26.220> to<00:05:26.340> recover<00:05:26.550> from<00:05:26.840> it's<00:05:27.840> gonna<00:05:27.960> take

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:28.170 
be hard to recover from it's gonna take

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:31.220 
be hard to recover from it's gonna take
some<00:05:28.290> time<00:05:28.380> and<00:05:28.830> um<00:05:29.820> that's<00:05:30.750> why<00:05:30.930> I<00:05:30.960> think

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:31.230 
some time and um that's why I think

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:32.810 
some time and um that's why I think
Activision<00:05:31.710> signed<00:05:31.920> with<00:05:32.070> bungee<00:05:32.460> because

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:32.820 
Activision signed with bungee because

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:35.600 
Activision signed with bungee because
I'm<00:05:33.510> not<00:05:33.750> hating<00:05:33.930> on<00:05:34.200> Infinity<00:05:34.920> Ward<00:05:35.130> but<00:05:35.460> I

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:35.610 
I'm not hating on Infinity Ward but I

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:37.130 
I'm not hating on Infinity Ward but I
think<00:05:35.850> bungee<00:05:36.150> does<00:05:36.300> a<00:05:36.330> better<00:05:36.540> job<00:05:36.630> listening

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:37.140 
think bungee does a better job listening

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:39.860 
think bungee does a better job listening
to<00:05:37.410> their<00:05:37.560> community<00:05:38.040> and<00:05:38.160> I'm<00:05:39.120> like<00:05:39.720> if

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:39.870 
to their community and I'm like if

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:40.880 
to their community and I'm like if
modern<00:05:40.110> work<00:05:40.230> for<00:05:40.380> two<00:05:40.530> would<00:05:40.650> have<00:05:40.740> had<00:05:40.860> a

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:40.890 
modern work for two would have had a

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:43.670 
modern work for two would have had a
beta<00:05:41.190> and<00:05:41.460> they<00:05:42.030> they<00:05:42.810> basically<00:05:43.140> discovered

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:43.680 
beta and they they basically discovered

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:45.800 
beta and they they basically discovered
it<00:05:43.880> commando<00:05:44.880> commandos<00:05:45.600> a<00:05:45.630> little

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:45.810 
it commando commandos a little

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:48.350 
it commando commandos a little
ridiculous<00:05:45.960> and<00:05:46.700> maybe<00:05:47.700> like<00:05:47.880> the<00:05:48.060> spawning

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:48.360 
ridiculous and maybe like the spawning

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:50.450 
ridiculous and maybe like the spawning
system<00:05:48.810> isn't<00:05:48.990> the<00:05:49.169> best<00:05:49.350> on<00:05:49.620> some<00:05:49.919> maps<00:05:50.130> then

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:50.460 
system isn't the best on some maps then

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:53.480 
system isn't the best on some maps then
you<00:05:51.060> go<00:05:51.360> back<00:05:51.390> and<00:05:51.570> change<00:05:51.870> that<00:05:52.110> but<00:05:52.340> I'm<00:05:53.340> the

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:53.490 
you go back and change that but I'm the

you go back and change that but I'm the
Infinity<00:05:53.940> Ward<00:05:54.180> realized<00:05:54.960> that<00:05:55.080> this<00:05:55.200> game

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:55.380 
Infinity Ward realized that this game

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:57.770 
Infinity Ward realized that this game
had<00:05:55.530> so<00:05:55.740> much<00:05:55.890> height<00:05:56.160> and<00:05:56.430> they<00:05:57.390> just<00:05:57.600> wanted

00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:57.780 
had so much height and they just wanted

00:05:57.780 --> 00:05:59.980 
had so much height and they just wanted
to<00:05:57.900> get<00:05:57.990> the<00:05:58.140> game<00:05:58.350> out<00:05:58.560> as<00:05:58.800> soon<00:05:59.040> as<00:05:59.160> possible

00:05:59.980 --> 00:05:59.990 
to get the game out as soon as possible

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:03.890 
to get the game out as soon as possible
and<00:06:00.990> I<00:06:01.080> think<00:06:01.530> in<00:06:01.740> the<00:06:01.919> end<00:06:02.060> that<00:06:03.060> um<00:06:03.270> that<00:06:03.660> hurt

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:03.900 
and I think in the end that um that hurt

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:06.130 
and I think in the end that um that hurt
them<00:06:04.110> a<00:06:04.290> little<00:06:04.410> bit<00:06:04.740> more<00:06:04.950> than<00:06:05.160> help<00:06:05.370> them

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:06.140 
them a little bit more than help them

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:09.080 
them a little bit more than help them
which<00:06:07.140> is<00:06:07.169> also<00:06:07.470> why<00:06:07.740> i<00:06:07.770> think<00:06:08.370> Reach<00:06:08.730> is<00:06:08.760> gonna

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:09.090 
which is also why i think Reach is gonna

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:10.550 
which is also why i think Reach is gonna
be<00:06:09.210> a<00:06:09.240> really<00:06:09.300> really<00:06:09.750> successful<00:06:09.960> game

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:10.560 
be a really really successful game

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:13.250 
be a really really successful game
because<00:06:11.430> they<00:06:11.700> got<00:06:11.820> the<00:06:12.000> beta<00:06:12.210> they<00:06:12.690> they<00:06:13.140> know

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:13.260 
because they got the beta they they know

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:14.450 
because they got the beta they they know
what's<00:06:13.410> wrong<00:06:13.470> and<00:06:13.830> hopefully<00:06:14.160> they're<00:06:14.400> gonna

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:14.460 
what's wrong and hopefully they're gonna

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:16.490 
what's wrong and hopefully they're gonna
fix<00:06:14.700> it<00:06:14.910> and<00:06:15.000> that's<00:06:15.150> one<00:06:15.360> game<00:06:15.570> that<00:06:15.780> i'm

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:16.500
