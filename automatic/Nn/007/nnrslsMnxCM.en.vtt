00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:42.130 
gonna create a new keyframe so click on

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:43.310 
gonna create a new keyframe so click on
this<00:03:42.310> one<00:03:42.549> here

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:43.320 
this one here

this one here
now<00:03:44.320> I'm<00:03:44.380> gonna<00:03:44.500> zoom<00:03:44.680> back<00:03:44.860> out<00:03:46.410> and<00:03:47.410> I'm

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:47.950 
now I'm gonna zoom back out and I'm

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:53.460 
now I'm gonna zoom back out and I'm
gonna<00:03:48.100> put<00:03:48.340> my<00:03:48.370> slider<00:03:48.880> to

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:53.470 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:58.680 

fifteen<00:03:54.460> F<00:03:54.670> and<00:03:55.710> I'm<00:03:56.710> going<00:03:57.190> to<00:03:57.310> hold<00:03:58.060> shift<00:03:58.150> on

00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:58.690 
fifteen F and I'm going to hold shift on

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:02.310 
fifteen F and I'm going to hold shift on
an<00:03:58.960> x-axis<00:03:59.350> and<00:03:59.860> slide<00:04:00.790> it<00:04:00.970> back<00:04:01.090> up<00:04:01.300> just<00:04:02.140> like

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:02.320 
an x-axis and slide it back up just like

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:04.980 
an x-axis and slide it back up just like
that<00:04:02.520> so<00:04:03.520> your<00:04:03.700> key<00:04:03.880> frames<00:04:04.210> should<00:04:04.690> look

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:04.990 
that so your key frames should look

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:05.940 
that so your key frames should look
something<00:04:05.260> like<00:04:05.380> this

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:05.950 
something like this

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:08.900 
something like this
you<00:04:06.220> can<00:04:06.460> see<00:04:06.640> there<00:04:06.850> now<00:04:07.780> if<00:04:07.900> I<00:04:07.960> play<00:04:08.140> it<00:04:08.170> back

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:08.910 
you can see there now if I play it back

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:12.390 
you can see there now if I play it back
you<00:04:09.910> can<00:04:09.940> see<00:04:10.210> it<00:04:10.240> slowly<00:04:10.630> drifts<00:04:11.320> and<00:04:12.250> it

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:12.400 
you can see it slowly drifts and it

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.090 
you can see it slowly drifts and it
should<00:04:12.520> slide<00:04:12.760> back<00:04:13.000> down<00:04:13.740> now<00:04:14.740> to<00:04:14.800> add<00:04:15.070> some

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:15.100 
should slide back down now to add some

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:17.550 
should slide back down now to add some
