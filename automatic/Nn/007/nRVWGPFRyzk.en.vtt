 A ring set with chalk on a blackboard, and with a group q, and Basel wheel and teachers 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:25.500
 It's fermented food in class 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:30.300
 These classes landscape now gone a little early death 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:35.940
 Running through the video, learning is becoming more common, 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:40.440
 Sean's e-notebook is also made by students carrying books. 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:42.060
 This development of advanced technology is not only the form of education but also the content of China 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:47.280
 I'm changing it. 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:50.460
 Then the brain training called out the word, and future changes in any way, 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:55.469

 tv Lifetime college It is time to look forward to the future in three times 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:00.989
 Future society seems like a time to learn more about the education that will become

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:08.810

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:22.970
 per te 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.390
 Ah 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:47.700
 We can request various information through the Internet in real time. 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:52.050
 I have. 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:53.070
 4 In the future, this concept of information and the concept of knowledge will also change 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:59.670
 That's it. 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:02:04.530
 7:00 is the word of knowledge two sides Rub chat Borough drab 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:09.780
 When there are no fixed knowledge, I changed yesterday, today, ignored the new 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:12.360
 It's not a knowledge, it's wrong. Zoe has a new revolution today 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:16.860
 When a new specter comes 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:20.940
 Uh 3 was right that Jojo has some handcuffs did wrong today, even this great cooking 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:24.630
 Another new theological figures above out of 5 Wars 2 is it.I thought 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:28.860
 So in the future there will be a flesh without the correct answer. 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:35.040
 Easyness becomes obsolete No need to take a test 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:39.300
 I keep coming up because it lasts two seconds before a new treatment before the third test bed 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:44.250
 Branson huh'll have the answer in brightness between the old Saturday that another test values

 Referred to so much new breakthrough geureopni What is new is radeunga January 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:54.090
 It's because new technology or new products come out of the studio. 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:56.519
 4 As society so rapidly changes, knowledge is created rapidly 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:03:00.750
 Concept of knowledge Concept of information 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:02.489
 The Nishi including three concept of yiralkkayo this talent and career along 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:06.930
 I think the concept will be different. 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:13.440
 If it does, it will eventually change the concept of success. 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:19.080
 Right now I do not study well because I am now old smart kid 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:23.940
 For more knowledge to introduce memory only carry walked out the information for free on the Internet 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:26.100
 It's seven billion times as much as it is now . 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:29.700
 Cleverly is already failing to 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:33.270
 So there are no smart lines and no lines. 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:36.300
 Poorly Rai hard to find the information went to the French sorrel 

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:41.690
 You know about motivation ? 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:45.930
 Oh, it 's funny. This kid thinks education and multiplayer is successful. 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:50.609
 No one is good at memorizing. 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:57.180
 Baewoyo 3 or 4 years, huh laws that go with friends, learn to top 

00:03:50.609 --> 00:04:00.480
 The world is now turning upside down, especially in 2015, 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:04.680
 Plan this story of education comes a chance 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:08.969
 4 So then we really need to figure out how to prepare the future society, 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:11.069
 How our children will educate about future education 

00:04:08.969 --> 00:04:16.139
 I'll look into it from now on. 

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:21.989
 4 The future changes at a really fast pace. 

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:26.220
 2 It is not competitive if we do not know future society that changes at a fast pace. 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:30.210
 I fall into a stone pool and I fall in love with you. 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:34.110
 In education there is already a basic reason why 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:37.710
 Middle and high school, especially high school 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:42.360
 In the map, if you do not reveal the future 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:46.979
 Because it's a crime operations have one group to teach wrong 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:51.979
 I have to go to this field by jumping to the disappearance , 

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:55.199
 I'm talking about yes , but especially in Korea now 

00:04:51.979 --> 00:04:57.750
 2015 will be the gateway to the heaven and earth 

00:04:55.199 --> 00:05:02.159
 Korea is more like a foreigner than me. 

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:10.460
 The reason for the change in education at the rate of change in Korea is that our country is 

00:05:02.159 --> 00:05:15.419
 Rapid population decline comes soon after 2015 when the university really a 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:18.870
 Synergy back is much more than high school graduates are going number 

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:22.710
 All high school students can come in. I can not go to school. 

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:25.590
 In addition, 

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:28.650
 Moreover, Uya has a lot of languages. 

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:34.770
 I only use Hangul. 

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:38.280
 What I observe something outside of the Foreign look alive five days the storm disaster in tha 

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:41.820
 If it is not so , and it comes to information, English robot arm cancer Spanish o 

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:46.830
 Speaking to the lead coming geudam Erasing gold 

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:48.990
 Korea is everything people do Hangul Day Hangul created once sprayed mate 

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:54.360
 I understand that foreigners 

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:57.960
 Huh, such as fish cakes are not writing Korean people have Korean Houses 

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:58.230
 I do not play movies, so I have to go to Korean service. 

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:01.710
 2 

00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:08.610
 This Korea is a single nation. 

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:10.380
 Thinking to have one with textbooks all this new experimentation at a fast pace 

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:16.320
 It's a test bed story. 

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:20.190
 Because Korea test of education is particularly Knit Knit ik what these Tint 

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:23.430
 Changes here are the best prediction would come first, now in South Korea 

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:28.620
 Some countries joined in 2025 

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:30.210
 When Korea becomes 2015, Cola &amp; 1 will be in the same place as oecd. 

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:34.110
 Holding a lot of visuals 

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:39.330
 My country is second. Yes. The student lived. The student lived. 

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:45.600
 There were no students . 2025 

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:49.050
 Even in 2015, there are far fewer high school graduates than university gardens. 

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:55.830
 These are the times to come come up 

00:06:49.050 --> 00:07:03.540
 In particular, in 1978, another boyeoseo in future studies of the magazine, feeding cold list 

00:06:55.830 --> 00:07:06.930
 I bought it, the media disappeared, and this newspaper disappeared. In 1978 

00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:10.290
 I look at it and I live in the media. 

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:14.250
 Very small, so powerful. 

00:07:10.290 --> 00:07:19.590
 Even if only at the time of strapping alone comes up, we went to school all four thousand detours 

00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:25.140
 I'll think of a newspaper article. 

00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:31.380
 Paper newspapers will almost disappear by 2015, and how do broadcasters 

00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:34.560
 Going 1 day media 1 person broadcasting 1 person Twitter person blogger work day reporter all 

00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:38.100
 One-man power goes to one-man enterprise profit 

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:43.890
 So change comes at a fast pace. 

00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:48.930
 Saudis also speaks more computer Voices ceo em korsman All 

00:07:43.890 --> 00:07:53.220
 Now, let 's go into the princess's place and talk. 

00:07:48.930 --> 00:07:54.360
 I will not write or will not write letters or words 

00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:59.640
 I'm talking. 

00:07:54.360 --> 00:08:05.250
 Now your computer is going to make words, words, talking computers computers will 

00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:11.960
 Why am I embrace send 200,000 won him the Bodhisattva sunsa a solution to take care of words 

00:08:05.250 --> 00:08:11.960
 Why is the condition of voice recognition?
