expansion<00:00:26.580> firstly<00:00:27.359> I'm<00:00:27.539> going<00:00:27.570> to<00:00:27.869> show<00:00:28.590> off

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:29.570 
expansion firstly I'm going to show off

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:34.970 
expansion firstly I'm going to show off
this<00:00:30.619> using<00:00:31.619> magmatic<00:00:32.160> engines<00:00:33.290> so<00:00:34.290> first<00:00:34.620> you

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
this using magmatic engines so first you

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:42.680 
this using magmatic engines so first you
got<00:00:35.160> to<00:00:35.280> do<00:00:38.989> is<00:00:39.989> create<00:00:40.559> a<00:00:40.649> pump<00:00:41.180> and<00:00:42.180> pump<00:00:42.420> some

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
got to do is create a pump and pump some

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.340 
got to do is create a pump and pump some
oil<00:00:42.840> on<00:00:44.000> lava

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:45.350 
oil on lava

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:47.930 
oil on lava
internet<00:00:46.350> under<00:00:46.440> tenant<00:00:46.920> tank<00:00:47.160> or<00:00:47.370> something

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
internet under tenant tank or something

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.840 
internet under tenant tank or something
like<00:00:48.059> that

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:49.850 
like that

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.930 
like that
and<00:00:50.850> just<00:00:51.410> pump<00:00:52.410> it<00:00:52.530> into<00:00:52.710> vengence<00:00:53.280> is<00:00:53.399> a<00:00:53.460> real

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
and just pump it into vengence is a real

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.860 
and just pump it into vengence is a real
easy<00:00:54.270> system<00:00:54.809> and<00:00:56.270> it's<00:00:57.270> great<00:00:57.510> a<00:00:57.570> lot<00:00:57.750> of

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
easy system and it's great a lot of

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:03.380 
easy system and it's great a lot of
power<00:00:58.309> the<00:00:59.309> one<00:00:59.489> downside<00:01:00.149> is<00:01:00.800> when<00:01:01.800> you<00:01:02.390> have

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
power the one downside is when you have

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:08.570 
power the one downside is when you have
it<00:01:03.570> nothing<00:01:04.729> to<00:01:05.729> power<00:01:06.650> after<00:01:07.650> a<00:01:07.920> while<00:01:08.100> the

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
it nothing to power after a while the

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.600 
it nothing to power after a while the
engines<00:01:09.060> will<00:01:09.659> stop<00:01:10.049> running<00:01:10.260> and<00:01:10.530> you<00:01:11.490> will

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
engines will stop running and you will

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.179 
engines will stop running and you will
need<00:01:11.760> to<00:01:12.119> brake<00:01:12.420> liquid<00:01:12.630> on<00:01:12.930> french<00:01:13.200> to<00:01:13.950> start

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
need to brake liquid on french to start

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:23.330 
need to brake liquid on french to start
from<00:01:18.290> its<00:01:19.290> it's<00:01:19.530> golden<00:01:20.100> and<00:01:21.409> we<00:01:22.409> create<00:01:22.710> for

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
from its it's golden and we create for

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.740 
from its it's golden and we create for
Minecraft<00:01:23.939> joules<00:01:24.240> per<00:01:24.360> tick<00:01:26.390> so<00:01:27.390> let's<00:01:27.630> say

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
Minecraft joules per tick so let's say

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.310 
Minecraft joules per tick so let's say
either<00:01:27.900> way<00:01:29.270> here's<00:01:30.270> some<00:01:30.540> other<00:01:30.659> way<00:01:30.840> it's

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
either way here's some other way it's

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.130 
either way here's some other way it's
with<00:01:31.829> regular<00:01:32.310> bancroft

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:33.140 
with regular bancroft

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.620 
with regular bancroft
so<00:01:34.140> first<00:01:34.439> you<00:01:34.619> will<00:01:35.070> need<00:01:35.909> to<00:01:36.060> collect<00:01:36.270> oil

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
so first you will need to collect oil

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.069 
so first you will need to collect oil
instead<00:01:37.409> of<00:01:37.670> love<00:01:38.670> like<00:01:39.329> in<00:01:39.509> that<00:01:39.659> system<00:01:39.840> and

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
instead of love like in that system and

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.850 
instead of love like in that system and
you<00:01:40.650> can<00:01:40.799> find<00:01:41.189> it<00:01:41.400> these<00:01:41.520> oily<00:01:42.030> spouts<00:01:42.860> around

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
you can find it these oily spouts around

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.160 
you can find it these oily spouts around
in<00:01:43.979> the<00:01:44.070> world<00:01:44.250> the<00:01:44.729> higher<00:01:44.970> usually<00:01:45.869> means

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
in the world the higher usually means

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.580 
in the world the higher usually means
more<00:01:46.380> oil<00:01:47.000> sometimes<00:01:48.000> respond<00:01:48.659> and<00:01:48.840> on<00:01:49.140> trees

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
more oil sometimes respond and on trees

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.780 
more oil sometimes respond and on trees
or<00:01:49.829> cloudy's<00:01:50.610> things<00:01:51.390> like<00:01:51.570> that<00:01:51.780> and<00:01:52.790> they

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
or cloudy's things like that and they

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.179 
or cloudy's things like that and they
strike<00:01:54.180> you

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:55.189 
strike you

00:01:55.189 --> 00:01:58.940 
strike you
then<00:01:56.189> you<00:01:56.310> need<00:01:56.430> to<00:01:56.579> refine<00:01:56.880> the<00:01:57.090> oil<00:01:57.329> and<00:01:57.950> pump

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
then you need to refine the oil and pump

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.030 
then you need to refine the oil and pump
it<00:01:59.130> into<00:01:59.369> combustion<00:02:00.270> engines<00:02:00.740> but<00:02:01.740> you<00:02:01.890> need

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
it into combustion engines but you need

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.760 
it into combustion engines but you need
to<00:02:02.159> cool<00:02:02.719> cooling<00:02:03.719> combustion<00:02:04.200> engines<00:02:04.560> is

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
to cool cooling combustion engines is

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.330 
to cool cooling combustion engines is
really<00:02:05.579> important<00:02:06.140> because<00:02:07.140> if<00:02:07.500> you<00:02:07.619> don't<00:02:08.129> do

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
really important because if you don't do

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.300 
really important because if you don't do
it<00:02:08.479> they<00:02:09.479> will<00:02:09.690> explain<00:02:10.050> here<00:02:10.739> I'm<00:02:10.890> cooling<00:02:11.250> it

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
it they will explain here I'm cooling it

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.400 
it they will explain here I'm cooling it
with<00:02:11.459> water<00:02:11.760> from<00:02:12.390> one<00:02:12.629> Aquos

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
with water from one Aquos

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.340 
with water from one Aquos
Hulme<00:02:13.620> later<00:02:14.150> an<00:02:15.150> aqueous<00:02:15.570> accumulator

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
Hulme later an aqueous accumulator

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:20.180 
Hulme later an aqueous accumulator
handles<00:02:17.210> can't<00:02:18.210> cool<00:02:18.750> free<00:02:19.200> engines<00:02:19.650> like

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
handles can't cool free engines like

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.630 
handles can't cool free engines like
this<00:02:20.400> a<00:02:20.640> pump<00:02:21.420> from<00:02:21.630> Bill<00:02:21.840> Croft<00:02:22.160> with<00:02:23.160> four

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
this a pump from Bill Croft with four

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.140 
this a pump from Bill Croft with four
rats<00:02:23.970> and<00:02:24.150> engines<00:02:24.540> can<00:02:25.080> net<00:02:25.350> I<00:02:25.790> think<00:02:26.790> it<00:02:26.970> is

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
rats and engines can net I think it is

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:31.760 
rats and engines can net I think it is
it<00:02:28.140> came<00:02:28.380> cool<00:02:28.740> too<00:02:29.190> and<00:02:29.900> these<00:02:30.900> produce<00:02:31.200> what

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
it came cool too and these produce what

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:40.000 
it came cool too and these produce what
is<00:02:31.890> it

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:45.320 

six<00:02:41.010> MJ<00:02:41.520> per<00:02:41.970> ticking<00:02:43.550> so<00:02:44.550> we<00:02:44.670> create<00:02:45.000> the<00:02:45.150> most

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
six MJ per ticking so we create the most

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.740 
six MJ per ticking so we create the most
power<00:02:45.600> per<00:02:45.870> engine<00:02:46.200> I<00:02:46.320> think<00:02:46.590> or<00:02:46.920> at<00:02:47.370> least<00:02:47.940> of

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
power per engine I think or at least of

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
power per engine I think or at least of
those<00:02:49.470> I<00:02:49.710> have<00:02:49.830> shown<00:02:50.070> you<00:02:50.100> now<00:02:51.500> but<00:02:52.500> those

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:52.770 
those I have shown you now but those

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:57.920 
those I have shown you now but those
ain't<00:02:53.550> renewable<00:02:55.040> but<00:02:56.040> this<00:02:56.310> is<00:02:56.570> so<00:02:57.570> firstly

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
ain't renewable but this is so firstly

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:59.630 
ain't renewable but this is so firstly
you<00:02:58.260> will<00:02:58.350> need<00:02:58.410> a<00:02:58.530> free<00:02:58.890> form<00:02:59.130> of<00:02:59.280> some<00:02:59.610> kind

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
you will need a free form of some kind

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:04.760 
you will need a free form of some kind
some<00:03:00.240> kind<00:03:00.270> and<00:03:01.700> then<00:03:02.700> you'll<00:03:03.180> need<00:03:03.360> to<00:03:03.770> sort

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:04.770 
some kind and then you'll need to sort

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:08.320 
some kind and then you'll need to sort
all<00:03:05.070> the<00:03:05.520> saplings<00:03:06.350> into<00:03:07.350> a<00:03:07.380> fermenter<00:03:08.070> and

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:08.330 
all the saplings into a fermenter and

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:11.480 
all the saplings into a fermenter and
this<00:03:09.330> is<00:03:09.480> using<00:03:09.690> force<00:03:10.080> to<00:03:10.170> by<00:03:10.380> the<00:03:10.440> way<00:03:10.860> where

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:11.490 
this is using force to by the way where

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:13.610 
this is using force to by the way where
you<00:03:11.670> will<00:03:11.820> need<00:03:12.390> to<00:03:12.450> supply<00:03:13.260> it<00:03:13.470> with

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
you will need to supply it with

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:18.530 
you will need to supply it with
fertilizer<00:03:14.100> and<00:03:14.400> water<00:03:14.610> water<00:03:15.600> is<00:03:15.810> just<00:03:17.540> walk

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
fertilizer and water water is just walk

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.170 
fertilizer and water water is just walk
walk<00:03:19.050> is<00:03:19.230> accumulator<00:03:19.770> and<00:03:20.130> your<00:03:20.850> sorting

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
walk is accumulator and your sorting

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:24.320 
walk is accumulator and your sorting
system<00:03:21.390> can<00:03:21.900> provide<00:03:22.800> it<00:03:23.070> with<00:03:23.330> fertilizer

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:24.330 
system can provide it with fertilizer

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:28.940 
system can provide it with fertilizer
and<00:03:24.959> then<00:03:25.470> you<00:03:25.890> will<00:03:26.070> need<00:03:26.250> a<00:03:26.600> still<00:03:27.770> to<00:03:28.770> make

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
and then you will need a still to make

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:35.110 
and then you will need a still to make
by<00:03:29.400> a<00:03:29.430> few<00:03:31.160> now<00:03:32.160> you<00:03:32.280> can<00:03:32.459> run<00:03:32.640> biofuel<00:03:33.270> in

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 
by a few now you can run biofuel in

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:39.650 
by a few now you can run biofuel in
biogas<00:03:36.120> engines<00:03:37.640> but<00:03:38.640> we<00:03:38.760> need<00:03:38.910> a<00:03:39.150> little<00:03:39.540> bit

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660 
biogas engines but we need a little bit

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:42.680 
biogas engines but we need a little bit
of<00:03:39.750> lava<00:03:40.020> to<00:03:40.320> start<00:03:40.560> up<00:03:40.709> and<00:03:40.980> they<00:03:41.700> will<00:03:42.090> create

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
of lava to start up and they will create

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:46.430 
of lava to start up and they will create

combustion<00:03:46.860> engines<00:03:47.310> where<00:03:47.610> they<00:03:47.790> will

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
combustion engines where they will

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:51.080 
combustion engines where they will
create<00:03:48.150> four<00:03:48.570> but<00:03:49.440> I<00:03:49.470> think<00:03:49.860> the<00:03:50.010> fuel<00:03:50.310> losts<00:03:50.940> a

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
create four but I think the fuel losts a

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:56.449 
create four but I think the fuel losts a
lot<00:03:51.420> longer<00:03:51.709> in<00:03:53.030> combustion<00:03:54.030> engine<00:03:55.459> instead

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:56.459 
lot longer in combustion engine instead

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:59.300 
lot longer in combustion engine instead
of<00:03:56.580> a<00:03:56.670> biogas<00:03:57.090> engine<00:03:57.560> so<00:03:58.560> if<00:03:58.650> you<00:03:58.800> want<00:03:59.010> energy

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
of a biogas engine so if you want energy

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:01.880 
of a biogas engine so if you want energy
fast<00:03:59.820> you<00:04:00.360> will<00:04:00.450> need<00:04:00.690> these<00:04:01.230> engines<00:04:01.620> if<00:04:01.770> you

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:01.890 
fast you will need these engines if you

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:04.310 
fast you will need these engines if you
want<00:04:02.040> it<00:04:02.190> to<00:04:03.000> last<00:04:03.180> longer<00:04:03.450> if<00:04:03.750> you<00:04:03.959> have<00:04:04.080> less

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:04.320 
want it to last longer if you have less

want it to last longer if you have less
saplings<00:04:04.910> you'll<00:04:05.910> need<00:04:06.150> these<00:04:07.940> here<00:04:08.940> is<00:04:09.090> a

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:09.830 
saplings you'll need these here is a

you<00:04:13.230> only<00:04:13.380> need<00:04:14.989> more<00:04:15.989> basic<00:04:16.320> resources<00:04:16.770> and

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:18.049 
you only need more basic resources and

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:23.719 
you only need more basic resources and
it's<00:04:19.049> just<00:04:19.260> normal<00:04:20.720> Stirling<00:04:21.720> engines<00:04:22.070> but<00:04:23.070> we

00:04:23.719 --> 00:04:23.729 
it's just normal Stirling engines but we

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:26.030 
it's just normal Stirling engines but we
just<00:04:23.910> filled<00:04:24.180> by<00:04:24.390> comb<00:04:24.660> here

most<00:04:26.700> people<00:04:27.030> use<00:04:27.180> Stirling<00:04:27.630> engines<00:04:28.110> in

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:28.230 
most people use Stirling engines in

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:32.140 
most people use Stirling engines in
beginning<00:04:28.560> and<00:04:29.060> some<00:04:30.060> just<00:04:30.990> want<00:04:31.110> to<00:04:31.410> keep

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:32.150 
beginning and some just want to keep

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:34.370 
beginning and some just want to keep
building<00:04:33.150> them<00:04:33.420> I<00:04:33.570> don't<00:04:33.750> recommend<00:04:34.140> the

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:34.380 
building them I don't recommend the

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:41.180 
building them I don't recommend the
system<00:04:34.770> but<00:04:37.310> you<00:04:38.310> might<00:04:38.460> use<00:04:38.670> it<00:04:38.850> and<00:04:40.010> here<00:04:41.010> so

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:41.190 
system but you might use it and here so

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:43.250 
system but you might use it and here so
I<00:04:41.280> think<00:04:41.850> it's<00:04:42.000> the<00:04:42.120> pub<00:04:42.390> most<00:04:42.690> powerful

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:43.260 
I think it's the pub most powerful

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:46.880 
I think it's the pub most powerful
system<00:04:43.620> that's<00:04:44.040> pretty<00:04:44.280> easy<00:04:44.580> to<00:04:44.760> build<00:04:45.890> the

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:46.890 
system that's pretty easy to build the

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:54.830 
system that's pretty easy to build the
steam<00:04:47.160> boiler<00:04:47.990> both<00:04:48.990> liquid<00:04:49.710> and<00:04:53.390> solid<00:04:54.390> fuel

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:54.840 
steam boiler both liquid and solid fuel

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:59.000 
steam boiler both liquid and solid fuel
and<00:04:55.580> these<00:04:56.580> are<00:04:56.760> steel<00:04:57.440> so<00:04:58.440> the<00:04:58.590> only<00:04:58.740> thing

00:04:59.000 --> 00:04:59.010 
and these are steel so the only thing

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:01.610 
and these are steel so the only thing
you<00:04:59.130> need<00:04:59.280> to<00:04:59.340> do<00:04:59.550> with<00:04:59.670> these<00:04:59.850> or<00:05:00.620> provide

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:01.620 
you need to do with these or provide

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:06.560 
you need to do with these or provide
them<00:05:01.860> with<00:05:02.010> water<00:05:04.130> like<00:05:05.130> that<00:05:05.430> and<00:05:06.060> give<00:05:06.450> them

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:06.570 
them with water like that and give them

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:10.030 
them with water like that and give them
something<00:05:06.840> you<00:05:07.500> can<00:05:07.680> use<00:05:07.890> most<00:05:08.880> huge<00:05:09.450> forces

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:10.040 
something you can use most huge forces

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:14.030 
something you can use most huge forces
liking<00:05:11.040> this<00:05:11.100> one<00:05:11.280> you<00:05:11.340> can<00:05:11.490> have<00:05:11.520> cone<00:05:13.040> just

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:14.040 
liking this one you can have cone just

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:16.130 
liking this one you can have cone just
put<00:05:14.400> your<00:05:14.520> cone<00:05:14.760> supply<00:05:15.090> into<00:05:15.360> it<00:05:15.420> but<00:05:15.930> you

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:16.140 
put your cone supply into it but you

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:19.040 
put your cone supply into it but you
should<00:05:16.320> know<00:05:16.530> that<00:05:17.400> it<00:05:17.850> requires<00:05:18.510> a<00:05:18.630> lot<00:05:18.780> of

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:19.050 
should know that it requires a lot of

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:25.730 
should know that it requires a lot of
coal<00:05:19.260> a<00:05:19.850> lot<00:05:20.850> to<00:05:21.600> heat<00:05:21.810> up<00:05:23.360> so<00:05:24.360> you<00:05:25.350> should<00:05:25.380> have

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:25.740 
coal a lot to heat up so you should have

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:28.580 
coal a lot to heat up so you should have
a<00:05:25.770> quite<00:05:26.460> bigger<00:05:26.790> supply<00:05:27.150> of<00:05:27.330> cone<00:05:27.570> before<00:05:28.230> or

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:28.590 
a quite bigger supply of cone before or

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:33.530 
a quite bigger supply of cone before or
peat<00:05:29.990> in<00:05:30.990> here<00:05:31.410> you<00:05:31.740> can<00:05:31.970> put<00:05:32.970> it<00:05:33.090> in<00:05:33.180> a<00:05:33.210> queue

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:33.540 
peat in here you can put it in a queue

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:38.420 
peat in here you can put it in a queue
and<00:05:33.690> you<00:05:34.140> can<00:05:34.500> pipe<00:05:35.010> it<00:05:35.190> in<00:05:35.310> or<00:05:36.210> use<00:05:37.430> barrels

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:38.430 
and you can pipe it in or use barrels

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:40.340 
and you can pipe it in or use barrels
like<00:05:38.940> I'm<00:05:39.120> doing<00:05:39.390> right<00:05:39.540> now<00:05:39.600> ones<00:05:39.990> for<00:05:40.200> show

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:40.350

like I'm doing right now ones for show
and<00:05:40.590> of<00:05:41.520> course<00:05:41.850> you<00:05:42.060> can<00:05:42.210> create<00:05:42.420> that<00:05:42.630> fuel

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:44.750 
and of course you can create that fuel

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:54.380 
and of course you can create that fuel
like<00:05:45.750> this<00:05:47.510> or<00:05:48.510> like<00:05:50.030> this<00:05:51.950> if<00:05:53.060> you<00:05:54.060> have<00:05:54.270> any
