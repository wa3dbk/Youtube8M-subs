what's up guys is Tyson here at item
hokkien<00:00:06.270> right<00:00:06.390> now<00:00:06.480> we're<00:00:06.600> taking<00:00:06.779> a<00:00:06.840> quick

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:07.050 
hokkien right now we're taking a quick

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:09.440 
hokkien right now we're taking a quick
look<00:00:07.080> at<00:00:07.470> the<00:00:07.500> east<00:00:07.770> and<00:00:07.980> EQ<00:00:08.490> 40<00:00:08.880> hockey<00:00:09.090> stick

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
look at the east and EQ 40 hockey stick

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.509 
look at the east and EQ 40 hockey stick
it's<00:00:09.960> a<00:00:10.020> great-looking<00:00:10.320> stick<00:00:10.889> into<00:00:11.070> Easton

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
it's a great-looking stick into Easton

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:13.610 
it's a great-looking stick into Easton
line<00:00:11.640> so<00:00:11.880> she<00:00:11.940> can<00:00:12.120> be<00:00:12.210> one<00:00:12.420> down<00:00:12.630> below<00:00:13.050> from

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
line so she can be one down below from

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.290 
line so she can be one down below from
the<00:00:13.800> EQ<00:00:14.160> 50<00:00:14.580> so<00:00:14.700> you're<00:00:14.849> never<00:00:15.000> going<00:00:15.120> to<00:00:15.150> get

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:15.300 
the EQ 50 so you're never going to get

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:16.700 
the EQ 50 so you're never going to get
some<00:00:15.450> good<00:00:15.630> performance<00:00:16.139> features<00:00:16.439> out<00:00:16.619> of

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
some good performance features out of

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.560 
some good performance features out of
this<00:00:16.770> stick<00:00:17.040> so<00:00:17.820> starting<00:00:18.119> out<00:00:18.240> on<00:00:18.270> the

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
this stick so starting out on the

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.960 
this stick so starting out on the
overall<00:00:18.840> shaft<00:00:19.529> construction<00:00:20.100> of<00:00:20.220> this<00:00:20.340> this

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
overall shaft construction of this this

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:21.950 
overall shaft construction of this this
is<00:00:21.119> also<00:00:21.270> going<00:00:21.330> to<00:00:21.449> be<00:00:21.510> using<00:00:21.570> what<00:00:21.840> they're

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
is also going to be using what they're

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.450 
is also going to be using what they're
calling<00:00:22.140> the<00:00:22.260> precision<00:00:22.740> molten<00:00:23.039> so<00:00:23.160> it's<00:00:23.279> not

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
calling the precision molten so it's not

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.849 
calling the precision molten so it's not
the<00:00:23.789> compression<00:00:24.750> molding<00:00:24.990> that<00:00:25.109> Easton<00:00:25.440> uses

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
the compression molding that Easton uses

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.650 
the compression molding that Easton uses
on<00:00:25.949> most<00:00:26.130> sir<00:00:26.250> sticks<00:00:26.550> so<00:00:27.270> it's<00:00:27.390> going<00:00:27.480> to<00:00:27.539> have

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
on most sir sticks so it's going to have

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.480 
on most sir sticks so it's going to have
a<00:00:27.720> balance<00:00:28.380> between<00:00:28.500> carbon<00:00:29.130> as<00:00:29.220> well<00:00:29.369> as<00:00:29.430> a

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
a balance between carbon as well as a

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.220 
a balance between carbon as well as a
little<00:00:29.699> bit<00:00:29.789> of<00:00:29.850> fiberglass<00:00:30.330> you<00:00:30.930> don't<00:00:31.080> have

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
little bit of fiberglass you don't have

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.960 
little bit of fiberglass you don't have
quite<00:00:31.439> as<00:00:31.560> much<00:00:31.769> fiberglass<00:00:32.250> on<00:00:32.430> this<00:00:32.610> is<00:00:32.790> what

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:32.970 
quite as much fiberglass on this is what

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:34.520 
quite as much fiberglass on this is what
you<00:00:33.120> saw<00:00:33.300> in<00:00:33.390> the<00:00:33.420> EQ<00:00:33.840> 30<00:00:34.110> so<00:00:34.260> it's<00:00:34.379> going<00:00:34.470> to

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
you saw in the EQ 30 so it's going to

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:35.960 
you saw in the EQ 30 so it's going to
make<00:00:34.650> the<00:00:34.769> stick<00:00:34.949> a<00:00:34.980> little<00:00:35.070> bit<00:00:35.340> lighter<00:00:35.640> a

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:35.970 
make the stick a little bit lighter a

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:37.460 
make the stick a little bit lighter a
little<00:00:36.150> bit<00:00:36.360> better<00:00:36.479> power<00:00:36.809> out<00:00:37.050> of<00:00:37.080> it<00:00:37.199> as

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:37.470 
little bit better power out of it as

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:40.100 
little bit better power out of it as
well<00:00:37.769> as<00:00:38.610> we<00:00:38.820> move<00:00:39.000> down<00:00:39.180> you'll<00:00:39.659> go<00:00:39.809> ahead<00:00:40.019> and

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
well as we move down you'll go ahead and

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.780 
well as we move down you'll go ahead and
you'll<00:00:40.199> see<00:00:40.500> that<00:00:40.739> taper<00:00:41.100> to<00:00:41.400> the<00:00:41.489> stick<00:00:41.670> so

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
you'll see that taper to the stick so

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:42.950 
you'll see that taper to the stick so
it's<00:00:41.879> gonna<00:00:42.000> have<00:00:42.120> a<00:00:42.180> lower<00:00:42.330> shot<00:00:42.629> release

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
it's gonna have a lower shot release

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.869 
it's gonna have a lower shot release
which<00:00:43.620> is<00:00:43.739> always<00:00:43.830> nice<00:00:44.010> nice<00:00:44.309> more<00:00:44.729> of<00:00:44.820> a

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
which is always nice nice more of a

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.610 
which is always nice nice more of a
snappy<00:00:45.299> feel<00:00:45.510> a<00:00:45.540> little<00:00:45.750> more<00:00:45.870> responsive<00:00:46.530> as

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
snappy feel a little more responsive as

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.710 
snappy feel a little more responsive as
well<00:00:46.799> and<00:00:47.549> then<00:00:47.670> also<00:00:47.850> another<00:00:48.210> nice<00:00:48.690> thing

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:48.720 
well and then also another nice thing

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:50.750 
well and then also another nice thing
that<00:00:49.080> this<00:00:49.140> 6<00:00:49.409> featuring<00:00:49.799> which<00:00:49.949> you<00:00:50.640> all<00:00:50.729> saw

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
that this 6 featuring which you all saw

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.610 
that this 6 featuring which you all saw
in<00:00:51.089> the<00:00:51.180> EQ<00:00:51.570> 30<00:00:51.839> is<00:00:52.019> being<00:00:52.320> that<00:00:52.440> it's<00:00:52.559> a

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
in the EQ 30 is being that it's a

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.590 
in the EQ 30 is being that it's a
precision<00:00:53.010> molded<00:00:53.460> design<00:00:53.760> they<00:00:54.180> don't<00:00:54.390> use

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
precision molded design they don't use

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.509 
precision molded design they don't use
the<00:00:54.780> same<00:00:55.049> full<00:00:55.500> Kevlar<00:00:55.890> wrap<00:00:56.100> that<00:00:56.250> they<00:00:56.369> use

00:00:56.509 --> 00:00:56.519 
the same full Kevlar wrap that they use

00:00:56.519 --> 00:00:58.460 
the same full Kevlar wrap that they use
in<00:00:56.640> the<00:00:56.729> compression<00:00:57.239> molded<00:00:57.510> do<00:00:58.229> the

00:00:58.460 --> 00:00:58.470 
in the compression molded do the

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:00.200 
in the compression molded do the
manufacturing<00:00:59.220> process<00:00:59.250> to<00:00:59.760> actually<00:00:59.850> have

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
manufacturing process to actually have

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.719 
manufacturing process to actually have
to<00:01:00.299> use<00:01:00.360> a<00:01:00.449> little<00:01:00.629> bit<00:01:00.750> of<00:01:00.839> a<00:01:00.930> different

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:01.729 
to use a little bit of a different

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:03.920 
to use a little bit of a different
construction<00:01:02.729> process<00:01:03.210> so<00:01:03.690> what<00:01:03.809> they've

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
construction process so what they've

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.390 
construction process so what they've
done<00:01:03.960> is<00:01:04.110> they<00:01:04.320> gone<00:01:04.470> ahead<00:01:04.589> and<00:01:04.739> took<00:01:05.040> those

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
done is they gone ahead and took those

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.179 
done is they gone ahead and took those
Kevlar<00:01:06.180> strands<00:01:06.600> and<00:01:06.869> separated<00:01:07.829> them<00:01:07.859> and

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
Kevlar strands and separated them and

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.010 
Kevlar strands and separated them and
then<00:01:08.310> laid<00:01:08.670> them<00:01:08.909> in<00:01:09.149> about<00:01:09.479> a<00:01:09.539> half<00:01:09.810> inch

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
then laid them in about a half inch

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.230 
then laid them in about a half inch
width<00:01:10.469> at<00:01:11.130> different<00:01:11.490> angles<00:01:11.640> to<00:01:12.000> give<00:01:12.119> it<00:01:12.180> a

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
width at different angles to give it a

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.789 
width at different angles to give it a
little<00:01:12.359> more<00:01:12.479> vibration<00:01:13.109> dampening<00:01:13.439> as<00:01:13.590> well

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
little more vibration dampening as well

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.920 
little more vibration dampening as well
as<00:01:13.950> impact<00:01:14.490> protection<00:01:14.700> I'm<00:01:15.149> so<00:01:15.659> you<00:01:15.719> can't

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
as impact protection I'm so you can't

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.740 
as impact protection I'm so you can't
see<00:01:16.079> them<00:01:16.200> as<00:01:16.530> well<00:01:17.039> on<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.430> blue<00:01:17.759> color<00:01:18.060> but

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
see them as well on the blue color but

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.599 
see them as well on the blue color but
if<00:01:18.810> you<00:01:18.899> check<00:01:19.079> out<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:19.380> EQ<00:01:19.710> 30<00:01:20.009> video<00:01:20.310> you<00:01:20.399> can

00:01:20.599 --> 00:01:20.609 
if you check out the EQ 30 video you can

00:01:20.609 --> 00:01:21.859 
if you check out the EQ 30 video you can
definitely<00:01:21.000> see<00:01:21.210> it<00:01:21.299> it<00:01:21.450> picks<00:01:21.630> it<00:01:21.689> up<00:01:21.750> a

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
definitely see it it picks it up a

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.300 
definitely see it it picks it up a
little<00:01:22.020> bit<00:01:22.140> better<00:01:22.380> with<00:01:22.560> that<00:01:22.679> orange<00:01:23.039> color

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
little bit better with that orange color

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.669 
little bit better with that orange color
down<00:01:23.520> towards<00:01:23.820> the<00:01:23.850> bottom<00:01:24.170> I'm<00:01:25.170> going<00:01:25.380> on<00:01:25.560> to

00:01:25.669 --> 00:01:25.679 
down towards the bottom I'm going on to

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:27.529 
down towards the bottom I'm going on to
the<00:01:25.770> blade<00:01:26.009> you<00:01:26.640> can<00:01:26.759> see<00:01:26.880> here<00:01:27.060> they're<00:01:27.299> using

00:01:27.529 --> 00:01:27.539 
the blade you can see here they're using

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:29.270 
the blade you can see here they're using
a<00:01:27.630> nice<00:01:27.780> higher<00:01:27.990> grade<00:01:28.289> of<00:01:28.320> carbon<00:01:28.950> than<00:01:29.100> what

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
a nice higher grade of carbon than what

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.910 
a nice higher grade of carbon than what
you<00:01:29.399> saw<00:01:29.579> on<00:01:29.820> the<00:01:29.909> EQ<00:01:30.420> 30<00:01:30.659> this<00:01:31.380> also<00:01:31.590> is<00:01:31.770> going

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
you saw on the EQ 30 this also is going

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.469 
you saw on the EQ 30 this also is going
to<00:01:31.979> be<00:01:32.039> a<00:01:32.070> multi<00:01:32.399> rib<00:01:32.549> design<00:01:32.880> so<00:01:33.299> you're<00:01:33.390> going

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
to be a multi rib design so you're going

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.450 
to be a multi rib design so you're going
to<00:01:33.539> have<00:01:33.600> actually<00:01:34.140> I'm<00:01:34.320> kind<00:01:34.649> of<00:01:34.679> like<00:01:34.799> a<00:01:34.829> I<00:01:35.280> be

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
to have actually I'm kind of like a I be

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.069 
to have actually I'm kind of like a I be
more<00:01:35.609> a<00:01:35.670> bridge<00:01:35.969> running<00:01:36.390> the<00:01:36.479> entire<00:01:36.600> length

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
more a bridge running the entire length

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.749 
more a bridge running the entire length
of<00:01:37.229> the<00:01:37.590> blade<00:01:37.710> and<00:01:38.009> this<00:01:38.520> is<00:01:38.579> going<00:01:38.700> to

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
of the blade and this is going to

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.700 
of the blade and this is going to
increase<00:01:39.149> overall<00:01:39.630> strength<00:01:40.140> to<00:01:40.380> ablate<00:01:40.590> so

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
increase overall strength to ablate so

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.139 
increase overall strength to ablate so
it's<00:01:40.829> going<00:01:40.920> to<00:01:40.979> distort<00:01:41.520> less<00:01:41.850> when<00:01:42.060> you're

00:01:42.139 --> 00:01:42.149 
it's going to distort less when you're

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:44.599 
it's going to distort less when you're
taking<00:01:42.420> your<00:01:42.509> shots<00:01:42.749> making<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:44.340> shots<00:01:44.549> a

00:01:44.599 --> 00:01:44.609 
taking your shots making the shots a

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:45.800 
taking your shots making the shots a
little<00:01:44.789> bit<00:01:44.880> stronger<00:01:45.149> as<00:01:45.420> well<00:01:45.600> as<00:01:45.659> more

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
little bit stronger as well as more

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.919 
little bit stronger as well as more
accurate<00:01:46.549> this<00:01:47.549> stick<00:01:47.729> also<00:01:48.060> features<00:01:48.450> the

00:01:48.919 --> 00:01:48.929 
accurate this stick also features the

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:51.020 
accurate this stick also features the
focus<00:01:49.319> weight<00:01:49.469> technology<00:01:50.039> so<00:01:50.640> you<00:01:50.700> can<00:01:50.819> see

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
focus weight technology so you can see

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.819 
focus weight technology so you can see
here<00:01:51.299> the<00:01:51.420> weights<00:01:51.630> in<00:01:51.929> the<00:01:51.960> blades<00:01:52.319> just<00:01:52.590> a

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
here the weights in the blades just a

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.289 
here the weights in the blades just a
little<00:01:53.310> bit<00:01:53.429> less<00:01:53.700> than<00:01:53.909> what<00:01:53.999> you<00:01:54.090> saw<00:01:54.210> in<00:01:54.270> the

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
little bit less than what you saw in the

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.359 
little bit less than what you saw in the
EQ<00:01:54.600> 50<00:01:54.929> but<00:01:55.079> a<00:01:55.109> little<00:01:55.289> bit<00:01:55.409> more<00:01:55.560> in<00:01:55.649> the<00:01:55.740> EQ<00:01:56.130> 30

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
EQ 50 but a little bit more in the EQ 30

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.190 
EQ 50 but a little bit more in the EQ 30
once<00:01:57.210> again<00:01:57.329> the<00:01:57.509> reason<00:01:57.630> for<00:01:57.929> the<00:01:57.990> difference

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
once again the reason for the difference

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.069 
once again the reason for the difference
of<00:01:58.560> the<00:01:58.649> weights<00:01:58.890> is<00:01:59.389> because<00:02:00.389> as<00:02:00.630> you<00:02:00.869> move

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
of the weights is because as you move

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:02.809 
of the weights is because as you move
down<00:02:01.109> in<00:02:01.409> the<00:02:01.469> line<00:02:01.649> the<00:02:02.009> actual<00:02:02.159> shaft<00:02:02.609> of<00:02:02.789> the

00:02:02.809 --> 00:02:02.819 
down in the line the actual shaft of the

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:04.429 
down in the line the actual shaft of the
stick<00:02:03.030> gets<00:02:03.149> a<00:02:03.270> little<00:02:03.389> bit<00:02:03.539> heavier<00:02:03.869> so<00:02:04.079> less

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
stick gets a little bit heavier so less

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.919 
stick gets a little bit heavier so less
weight<00:02:05.039> is<00:02:05.219> needed<00:02:05.549> to<00:02:05.579> balance<00:02:05.789> it<00:02:06.119> out<00:02:06.210> so

00:02:06.919 --> 00:02:06.929 
weight is needed to balance it out so

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:09.080 
weight is needed to balance it out so
you<00:02:07.020> can<00:02:07.170> see<00:02:07.530> here<00:02:07.889> but<00:02:08.490> what<00:02:08.610> the<00:02:08.729> weight<00:02:08.910> is

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
you can see here but what the weight is

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:10.430 
you can see here but what the weight is
going<00:02:09.240> to<00:02:09.300> do<00:02:09.420> in<00:02:09.539> the<00:02:09.600> boys<00:02:09.750> can<00:02:10.229> you<00:02:10.289> give<00:02:10.410> it

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
going to do in the boys can you give it

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.050 
going to do in the boys can you give it
more<00:02:10.590> of<00:02:10.649> a<00:02:10.740> solid<00:02:11.009> feel<00:02:11.430> when<00:02:11.940> you're

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
more of a solid feel when you're

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.430 
more of a solid feel when you're
receiving<00:02:12.299> passes<00:02:12.900> the<00:02:12.989> puck<00:02:13.140> is<00:02:13.260> going<00:02:13.290> to

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
receiving passes the puck is going to

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:14.570 
receiving passes the puck is going to
want<00:02:13.530> to<00:02:13.620> stay<00:02:13.769> on<00:02:13.799> the<00:02:13.950> blade<00:02:14.129> a<00:02:14.159> little<00:02:14.489> bit

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
want to stay on the blade a little bit

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.399 
want to stay on the blade a little bit
better<00:02:14.730> making<00:02:15.480> a<00:02:15.629> little<00:02:15.750> bit<00:02:15.930> easier<00:02:16.260> to

00:02:16.399 --> 00:02:16.409 
better making a little bit easier to

00:02:16.409 --> 00:02:17.320 
better making a little bit easier to
make<00:02:16.530> that<00:02:16.680> next<00:02:16.890> player

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330 
make that next player

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:19.690 
make that next player
those<00:02:17.420> quick<00:02:17.690> one<00:02:17.930> timers<00:02:18.410> or<00:02:18.620> shots<00:02:19.460> or

those quick one timers or shots or

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.790 
those quick one timers or shots or
passes<00:02:20.180> so<00:02:20.960> as<00:02:21.050> far<00:02:21.140> as<00:02:21.230> the<00:02:21.350> overall<00:02:21.530> field

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.530 
passes so as far as the overall field
goes<00:02:21.980> in<00:02:22.100> this<00:02:22.190> stick<00:02:22.430> it<00:02:22.970> has<00:02:23.060> a<00:02:23.120> nice<00:02:23.270> feel<00:02:23.480> to

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
goes in this stick it has a nice feel to

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.830 
goes in this stick it has a nice feel to
it<00:02:23.720> a<00:02:24.250> pretty<00:02:25.250> pretty<00:02:25.640> balanced<00:02:25.940> feel<00:02:26.660> it's

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
it a pretty pretty balanced feel it's

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:27.970 
it a pretty pretty balanced feel it's
not<00:02:26.960> going<00:02:27.050> to<00:02:27.140> be<00:02:27.200> the<00:02:27.290> lightest<00:02:27.680> stick<00:02:27.830> on

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
not going to be the lightest stick on

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:29.920 
not going to be the lightest stick on
the<00:02:28.040> market<00:02:28.370> but<00:02:29.150> it<00:02:29.270> definitely<00:02:29.420> does<00:02:29.720> have<00:02:29.870> a

pretty good balance feel to it a little

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:33.160 
pretty good balance feel to it a little

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
bit more blade heavy than what you saw
