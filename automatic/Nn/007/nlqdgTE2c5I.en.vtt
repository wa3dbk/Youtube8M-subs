00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
is probably a shaking and those are

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.200 
is probably a shaking and those are
pretty<00:00:28.859> easy<00:00:29.099> that<00:00:29.429> shouldn't<00:00:29.699> take<00:00:29.730> one<00:00:30.029> more

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
pretty easy that shouldn't take one more

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.359 
pretty easy that shouldn't take one more
and<00:00:30.840> then<00:00:30.990> just<00:00:31.439> a<00:00:31.590> simple<00:00:31.920> backside

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
and then just a simple backside

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.479 
and then just a simple backside
boardslide<00:00:32.850> on<00:00:32.880> the<00:00:33.149> rail<00:00:33.829> slightly<00:00:34.829> out<00:00:34.920> and

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
boardslide on the rail slightly out and

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.979 
boardslide on the rail slightly out and
to<00:00:36.239> fakie<00:00:36.690> would<00:00:36.870> help<00:00:37.079> a<00:00:37.350> lot<00:00:37.530> too<00:00:37.920> so<00:00:38.989> then

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
want to do in trying the trick so first

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.549 
want to do in trying the trick so first
of<00:00:52.289> all<00:00:52.460> come<00:00:53.460> at<00:00:53.640> it<00:00:53.820> Cole<00:00:54.180> just<00:00:55.170> like<00:00:55.289> that

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
and not too close to the rail because if

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.260 
and not too close to the rail because if
you<00:00:57.960> go<00:00:57.989> too<00:00:58.170> close<00:00:58.520> people<00:00:59.520> will<00:00:59.670> go<00:00:59.789> under

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
you go too close people will go under

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.479 
you go too close people will go under
and<00:01:00.899> your<00:01:01.260> looks<00:01:01.440> like<00:01:01.620> fall<00:01:01.920> for<00:01:02.190> it<00:01:02.280> on<00:01:02.399> your

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
and your looks like fall for it on your

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.050 
and your looks like fall for it on your
face<00:01:02.730> and<00:01:02.940> that's<00:01:03.030> never<00:01:03.270> a<00:01:03.449> good<00:01:03.510> thing<00:01:05.060> so

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
face and that's never a good thing so

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.960 
face and that's never a good thing so
you're<00:01:06.659> approaching<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.320> rail<00:01:07.530> or<00:01:08.040> ledge<00:01:08.790> or

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
you're approaching the rail or ledge or

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.429 
you're approaching the rail or ledge or
whatever<00:01:09.299> you're<00:01:09.540> doing<00:01:09.780> arm<00:01:09.960> doesn't<00:01:10.229> matter

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
whatever you're doing arm doesn't matter

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.940 
whatever you're doing arm doesn't matter
you're<00:01:10.830> approaching<00:01:11.280> it<00:01:11.400> parallel<00:01:12.119> then

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:12.950 
you're approaching it parallel then

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:16.969 
you're approaching it parallel then
before<00:01:13.950> trying<00:01:14.520> to<00:01:14.900> hold<00:01:15.900> on<00:01:16.229> to<00:01:16.530> the<00:01:16.680> slide

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
before trying to hold on to the slide

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.520 
before trying to hold on to the slide
like<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:17.670> whole<00:01:17.820> way<00:01:18.030> first<00:01:18.930> I<00:01:19.259> would

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
like the whole way first I would

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.960 
like the whole way first I would
recommend<00:01:21.229> just<00:01:22.229> getting<00:01:22.619> into<00:01:22.890> it<00:01:22.920> first<00:01:23.250> and

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
recommend just getting into it first and

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.800 
recommend just getting into it first and
then<00:01:24.830> jumping<00:01:25.830> right<00:01:26.040> off<00:01:26.280> like<00:01:27.030> really<00:01:27.600> quick

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
then jumping right off like really quick

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.399 
then jumping right off like really quick
don't<00:01:28.110> even<00:01:28.380> slide<00:01:28.619> just<00:01:28.799> jump<00:01:29.040> right<00:01:29.130> off<00:01:30.409> it

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
don't even slide just jump right off it

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:37.770 
don't even slide just jump right off it
should<00:01:31.770> look<00:01:31.979> something<00:01:32.040> like<00:01:32.430> this

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:37.780 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:40.060 

so<00:01:38.780> that's<00:01:39.049> what<00:01:39.259> you<00:01:39.290> want<00:01:39.530> to<00:01:39.619> do<00:01:39.770> when<00:01:39.950> you

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070 
so that's what you want to do when you

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:43.539 
so that's what you want to do when you
first<00:01:40.310> like<00:01:40.520> try<00:01:40.939> now<00:01:41.659> you<00:01:42.470> get<00:01:42.619> a<00:01:43.009> little<00:01:43.460> bit

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:43.549 
first like try now you get a little bit

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:45.580 
first like try now you get a little bit
comfortable<00:01:43.970> with<00:01:44.150> that<00:01:44.330> it<00:01:44.840> can<00:01:45.020> start<00:01:45.259> going

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590 
comfortable with that it can start going

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.190 
comfortable with that it can start going
a<00:01:45.650> little<00:01:45.770> faster<00:01:46.400> naturally<00:01:47.030> trying<00:01:47.659> to<00:01:47.899> side

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:48.200 
a little faster naturally trying to side

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.539 
a little faster naturally trying to side
and<00:01:48.920> I<00:01:49.369> dress<00:01:50.740> starting<00:01:51.740> in<00:01:51.890> the<00:01:51.920> middle<00:01:52.430> of

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:52.549 
and I dress starting in the middle of

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:56.410 
and I dress starting in the middle of
the<00:01:52.640> rail<00:01:52.940> or<00:01:53.180> the<00:01:53.299> web<00:01:53.799> and<00:01:55.090> slide<00:01:56.090> for<00:01:56.390> a

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.420 
the rail or the web and slide for a

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.029 
the rail or the web and slide for a
little<00:01:56.720> bit<00:01:56.990> so<00:01:57.200> that<00:01:57.229> way<00:01:57.470> you<00:01:57.530> have<00:01:57.680> time<00:01:58.009> to

00:01:58.029 --> 00:01:58.039 
little bit so that way you have time to

00:01:58.039 --> 00:02:03.820 
little bit so that way you have time to
come<00:01:58.340> out<00:01:58.399> of<00:01:58.729> it<00:01:59.680> so<00:02:00.680> you<00:02:02.140> do<00:02:03.140> you're<00:02:03.380> faking

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:03.830 
come out of it so you do you're faking

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:08.229 
come out of it so you do you're faking
pain<00:02:04.070> and<00:02:04.750> you<00:02:05.750> start<00:02:06.049> sliding<00:02:06.610> then<00:02:07.610> coming

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:08.239 
pain and you start sliding then coming

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:10.990 
pain and you start sliding then coming
on<00:02:08.360> is<00:02:08.420> a<00:02:08.600> little<00:02:08.959> tricky<00:02:09.259> what<00:02:10.160> you<00:02:10.399> normally

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
on is a little tricky what you normally

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.750 
on is a little tricky what you normally
would<00:02:11.420> want<00:02:11.690> to<00:02:11.810> do<00:02:11.989> just<00:02:12.590> come<00:02:12.890> back<00:02:13.069> like

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
would want to do just come back like

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.670 
would want to do just come back like
that's<00:02:13.940> irregular<00:02:14.510> but<00:02:15.080> that's<00:02:15.350> not<00:02:15.500> the

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
that's irregular but that's not the

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.430 
that's irregular but that's not the
trick<00:02:15.860> I'm<00:02:16.010> teaching<00:02:16.370> you<00:02:16.989> you<00:02:17.989> want<00:02:18.170> to<00:02:18.260> come

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
trick I'm teaching you you want to come

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.790
