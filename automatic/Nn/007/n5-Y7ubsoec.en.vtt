is just a lot a lot of customizations on
it<00:03:48.750> and<00:03:48.930> I<00:03:49.500> think<00:03:50.070> over<00:03:50.250> we<00:03:50.520> can<00:03:50.700> make<00:03:50.850> make<00:03:51.270> a

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
it and I think over we can make make a

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:54.350 
it and I think over we can make make a
nice<00:03:51.810> looking<00:03:52.350> car<00:03:52.620> it's<00:03:53.190> actually<00:03:53.460> like

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:54.360 
nice looking car it's actually like

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:56.330

completely<00:03:54.870> done<00:03:55.140> up<00:03:55.320> the<00:03:55.500> car<00:03:55.740> itself<00:03:56.100> is

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 
completely done up the car itself is

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:00.170 
completely done up the car itself is
really<00:03:56.640> fast<00:03:57.270> I<00:03:57.600> think<00:03:57.990> it's<00:03:58.110> possibly<00:03:59.150> one<00:04:00.150> of

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
really fast I think it's possibly one of

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:03.200 
really fast I think it's possibly one of
the<00:04:00.300> fastest<00:04:00.930> SUVs<00:04:01.560> if<00:04:01.770> not<00:04:02.040> the<00:04:02.340> fastest<00:04:02.790> SUV

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:03.210
