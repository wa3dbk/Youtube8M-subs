a<00:00:07.460> great<00:00:08.460> distortion<00:00:08.940> pedal<00:00:09.269> I<00:00:09.389> changed<00:00:09.929> out

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
a great distortion pedal I changed out

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.410 
a great distortion pedal I changed out
the<00:00:10.139> LEDs<00:00:10.920> with<00:00:11.190> blue<00:00:11.400> LEDs<00:00:11.820> just<00:00:11.849> because

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
the LEDs with blue LEDs just because

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.289 
the LEDs with blue LEDs just because
it's<00:00:12.840> easier<00:00:13.170> to<00:00:13.230> see<00:00:13.639> gonna<00:00:14.639> start<00:00:15.000> with

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
it's easier to see gonna start with

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.500 
it's easier to see gonna start with
everything<00:00:15.990> in<00:00:16.080> the<00:00:16.139> 12<00:00:16.440> o'clock<00:00:16.949> position<00:00:17.510> I

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
everything in the 12 o'clock position I

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:19.880 
everything in the 12 o'clock position I
always<00:00:19.230> like<00:00:19.350> to<00:00:19.470> put<00:00:19.619> these<00:00:19.740> little

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
always like to put these little

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.410 
always like to put these little
indicators<00:00:20.430> up<00:00:20.580> here<00:00:20.760> just<00:00:20.910> so<00:00:21.000> I<00:00:21.090> know<00:00:21.180> where

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
indicators up here just so I know where

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:34.780 
indicators up here just so I know where
I'm<00:00:21.539> going<00:00:23.660> this<00:00:24.660> is<00:00:24.900> a<00:00:24.930> clean

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:34.790 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:37.600 

that's<00:00:35.380> with<00:00:36.380> multiple<00:00:36.920> notes<00:00:37.100> this<00:00:37.280> is<00:00:37.460> it

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:37.610 
that's with multiple notes this is it

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:45.580 
that's with multiple notes this is it
with<00:00:37.760> a<00:00:37.850> single<00:00:38.690> note<00:00:44.020> you<00:00:45.020> can<00:00:45.170> see<00:00:45.350> you<00:00:45.440> got

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:45.590 
with a single note you can see you got

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:50.140 
with a single note you can see you got
the<00:00:45.710> drive<00:00:45.980> function<00:00:48.520> even<00:00:49.520> with<00:00:49.790> the<00:00:49.880> drive

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:50.150 
the drive function even with the drive

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:52.150 
the drive function even with the drive
and<00:00:50.180> it<00:00:50.780> like<00:00:50.990> basically<00:00:51.230> cut<00:00:51.770> all<00:00:51.950> the<00:00:52.040> way

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:52.160 
and it like basically cut all the way

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.070 
and it like basically cut all the way
down<00:00:52.340> it<00:00:52.760> still<00:00:53.030> gives<00:00:53.240> you<00:00:53.420> a<00:00:53.480> little<00:00:53.840> bit<00:00:53.960> of

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:54.080 
down it still gives you a little bit of

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:58.510 
down it still gives you a little bit of
that<00:00:54.200> overdrive<00:00:54.770> sound<00:00:57.070> especially<00:00:58.070> if<00:00:58.430> you

00:00:58.510 --> 00:00:58.520 
that overdrive sound especially if you

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.060 
that overdrive sound especially if you
dig<00:00:58.760> in<00:00:58.990> you<00:00:59.990> can<00:01:00.140> see<00:01:00.320> here<00:01:00.530> I<00:01:00.560> usually<00:01:00.950> keep

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:01.070 
dig in you can see here I usually keep

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:02.500 
dig in you can see here I usually keep
mine<00:01:01.310> in<00:01:01.340> roughly<00:01:01.850> the<00:01:01.940> three<00:01:02.300> o'clock

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:02.510 
mine in roughly the three o'clock

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:05.560 
mine in roughly the three o'clock
position<00:01:03.010> or<00:01:04.010> is<00:01:04.160> that<00:01:04.280> I<00:01:04.970> don't<00:01:05.120> know<00:01:05.210> exactly

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:05.570 
position or is that I don't know exactly

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:07.090 
position or is that I don't know exactly
what<00:01:05.750> a<00:01:05.780> clock<00:01:06.050> that<00:01:06.260> is<00:01:06.320> but<00:01:06.680> that's<00:01:06.860> where<00:01:07.010> it

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:07.100 
what a clock that is but that's where it

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:17.469 
what a clock that is but that's where it
is<00:01:14.350> tone<00:01:15.350> this<00:01:16.340> one<00:01:16.940> thing<00:01:17.060> I<00:01:17.150> do<00:01:17.210> like<00:01:17.420> about

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:17.479 
is tone this one thing I do like about

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:19.180 
is tone this one thing I do like about
this<00:01:17.780> pedal<00:01:18.110> is<00:01:18.260> the<00:01:18.290> tongue<00:01:18.590> really<00:01:18.950> does

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:19.190 
this pedal is the tongue really does

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:22.300 
this pedal is the tongue really does
change<00:01:19.550> a<00:01:19.880> real<00:01:20.240> big<00:01:20.570> dynamic<00:01:20.810> of<00:01:21.229> it<00:01:21.410> this<00:01:22.100> is

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:22.310 
change a real big dynamic of it this is

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.450 
change a real big dynamic of it this is
with<00:01:22.460> its<00:01:22.580> own<00:01:22.900> cut<00:01:23.900> all<00:01:24.020> the<00:01:24.140> way<00:01:24.229> back<00:01:24.460> with

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:25.460 
with its own cut all the way back with

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:28.660 
with its own cut all the way back with
the<00:01:25.790> toe<00:01:26.000> knobs<00:01:26.330> on<00:01:26.600> my<00:01:26.900> normani<00:01:27.920> are<00:01:28.160> turned

the toe knobs on my normani are turned

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:44.580 
the toe knobs on my normani are turned
all<00:01:28.880> the<00:01:29.000> way<00:01:29.150> up

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:44.590 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:47.660 

gives<00:01:45.430> it<00:01:45.550> a<00:01:45.640> lot<00:01:45.790> more<00:01:45.850> that<00:01:46.240> I<00:01:46.660> guess<00:01:46.990> Rock

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
gives it a lot more that I guess Rock

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.700 
gives it a lot more that I guess Rock
British<00:01:48.670> rock<00:01:49.060> sound<00:01:49.420> this<00:01:49.690> is<00:01:49.960> just<00:01:50.470> kind<00:01:50.650> of

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:50.710 
British rock sound this is just kind of

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:52.950 
British rock sound this is just kind of
an<00:01:50.980> American<00:01:51.430> overdrive<00:01:52.180> right<00:01:52.420> here<00:01:52.690> where<00:01:52.930> I

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:52.960 
an American overdrive right here where I

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.290 
an American overdrive right here where I
kind<00:01:53.260> of<00:01:53.290> keep<00:01:53.500> mine<00:01:53.740> tone<00:01:54.040> back<00:01:54.250> to<00:01:54.520> put<00:01:55.270> the

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:55.300 
kind of keep mine tone back to put the

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:57.060 
kind of keep mine tone back to put the
volume<00:01:55.540> back<00:01:55.780> because<00:01:56.050> it<00:01:56.170> is<00:01:56.200> a<00:01:56.530> punching

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:57.070

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:06.310 

bass<00:02:03.920> boost<00:02:04.250> a<00:02:04.910> noticeable<00:02:05.810> difference<00:02:05.930> with

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:06.320 
bass boost a noticeable difference with

bass boost a noticeable difference with
the

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.839 

I'll<00:02:17.720> leave<00:02:17.900> that<00:02:17.930> on<00:02:18.230> um<00:02:18.530> I'm<00:02:19.340> gonna<00:02:19.490> do<00:02:19.700> this

00:02:19.839 --> 00:02:19.849 
I'll leave that on um I'm gonna do this

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:21.760 
I'll leave that on um I'm gonna do this
one<00:02:20.090> separately<00:02:20.720> this<00:02:20.870> is<00:02:21.020> the<00:02:21.110> compression

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:21.770 
one separately this is the compression

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:25.059 
one separately this is the compression
side<00:02:22.599> works<00:02:23.599> really<00:02:23.840> well<00:02:24.080> especially<00:02:24.590> it

00:02:25.059 --> 00:02:25.069 
side works really well especially it

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:26.589 
side works really well especially it
gives<00:02:25.220> you<00:02:25.340> a<00:02:25.400> little<00:02:25.550> extra<00:02:25.940> volume<00:02:26.090> I<00:02:26.420> leave

00:02:26.589 --> 00:02:26.599 
gives you a little extra volume I leave

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:29.110 
gives you a little extra volume I leave
tone<00:02:26.989> control<00:02:27.530> off<00:02:27.800> just<00:02:28.220> because<00:02:28.340> I<00:02:28.520> kind<00:02:29.060> of

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
tone control off just because I kind of

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:30.550 
tone control off just because I kind of
it<00:02:29.330> kind<00:02:29.420> of<00:02:29.510> mutes<00:02:29.780> a<00:02:29.900> little<00:02:30.140> bit<00:02:30.230> more<00:02:30.410> than

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
it kind of mutes a little bit more than

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.070 
it kind of mutes a little bit more than
I<00:02:30.620> like<00:02:30.830> it<00:02:30.980> to<00:02:31.160> but<00:02:31.910> this<00:02:32.090> is<00:02:32.150> this<00:02:32.810> is<00:02:32.870> the

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080 
I like it to but this is this is the

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
I like it to but this is this is the
tone<00:02:33.290> control<00:02:33.709> side<00:02:38.739> that's<00:02:39.739> the<00:02:39.860> tone

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:40.100 
tone control side that's the tone

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:52.710 
tone control side that's the tone
control<00:02:40.489> on<00:02:40.730> now

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:03:01.650 

so<00:02:53.720> once<00:02:54.380> again<00:02:54.680> same<00:02:54.980> as<00:02:55.010> the<00:02:55.220> other<00:02:55.370> side

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:04.809 

and<00:03:02.660> then<00:03:02.900> the<00:03:03.020> sustain<00:03:03.470> sustaining<00:03:04.430> it

00:03:04.809 --> 00:03:04.819 
and then the sustain sustaining it

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:06.040 
and then the sustain sustaining it
really<00:03:05.120> does<00:03:05.270> do<00:03:05.480> quite<00:03:05.510> a<00:03:05.780> substantial

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:06.050 
really does do quite a substantial

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:13.930

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
pickups right now so anyway this is this

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:11.180 

and<00:04:07.350> obviously<00:04:07.830> as<00:04:08.490> you<00:04:08.730> change<00:04:09.000> stuff<00:04:09.380> it<00:04:10.380> it

and obviously as you change stuff it it

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:13.310 
and obviously as you change stuff it it
definitely<00:04:11.790> changes<00:04:12.150> the<00:04:12.180> dynamic<00:04:12.840> with<00:04:13.110> both

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:13.320 
definitely changes the dynamic with both

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:15.620 
definitely changes the dynamic with both
of<00:04:13.530> these<00:04:13.620> on<00:04:13.860> really<00:04:14.460> works<00:04:14.790> well<00:04:15.060> with<00:04:15.360> other

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:17.850 
my other distortions as well just for

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:20.240 
my other distortions as well just for

those from just overpowering everything
with<00:04:22.620> the<00:04:22.710> compression<00:04:23.040> side<00:04:23.340> so<00:04:24.060> anyway<00:04:24.660> that

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:25.350 
with the compression side so anyway that

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:29.630 
with the compression side so anyway that
