00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.950 
that hasn't been possible in board games
before<00:01:00.890> so<00:01:01.890> just<00:01:02.370> a<00:01:02.969> couple<00:01:03.239> of<00:01:03.480> quick<00:01:03.660> little

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
before so just a couple of quick little

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.800 
before so just a couple of quick little
demos<00:01:04.290> here<00:01:04.619> so<00:01:05.220> I<00:01:05.250> mentioned<00:01:05.909> that<00:01:05.939> the<00:01:06.180> the

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
demos here so I mentioned that the the

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.660 
demos here so I mentioned that the the
smart<00:01:07.080> device<00:01:07.320> makes<00:01:07.680> the<00:01:07.890> game<00:01:08.070> easier<00:01:08.340> to

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
smart device makes the game easier to

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.640 
smart device makes the game easier to
play<00:01:08.880> here's<00:01:09.210> an<00:01:09.330> example<00:01:09.600> of<00:01:09.780> that<00:01:09.840> playing<00:01:10.200> a

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
play here's an example of that playing a

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.530 
play here's an example of that playing a
game<00:01:10.830> like<00:01:11.010> this<00:01:11.070> I<00:01:11.460> might<00:01:11.700> I<00:01:11.909> might<00:01:12.060> not

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
game like this I might I might not

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.240

anytime I could just touch any region on
the<00:01:17.310> map<00:01:17.520> board<00:01:17.759> like<00:01:18.000> that<00:01:18.210> and<00:01:18.530> the<00:01:19.530> app<00:01:19.680> just

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
the map board like that and the app just

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.710 
the map board like that and the app just
zooms<00:01:20.220> right<00:01:20.490> in<00:01:20.670> and<00:01:20.820> reminds<00:01:21.299> me<00:01:21.420> of<00:01:21.540> all<00:01:21.630> the

app<00:01:57.149> is<00:01:57.360> going<00:01:57.540> to<00:01:57.600> keep<00:01:57.750> us<00:01:57.930> honest<00:01:58.320> and<00:01:58.439> it's

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
app is going to keep us honest and it's

00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:59.899 
app is going to keep us honest and it's
going<00:01:58.649> to<00:01:58.710> handle<00:01:59.040> all<00:01:59.159> that<00:01:59.280> stuff<00:01:59.549> almost

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
going to handle all that stuff almost

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.030 
going to handle all that stuff almost
like<00:02:00.030> it's<00:02:00.180> a<00:02:00.270> referee<00:02:00.600> here's<00:02:01.469> how<00:02:01.619> an<00:02:01.740> attack

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
like it's a referee here's how an attack

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.990 
like it's a referee here's how an attack
would<00:02:02.219> work<00:02:02.540> again<00:02:03.540> I<00:02:03.750> sort<00:02:04.170> of<00:02:04.259> I<00:02:04.640> tap<00:02:05.640> the

would work again I sort of I tap the

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.999 
would work again I sort of I tap the

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.480 
attack power in this case lava Lance I
just<00:02:10.679> tapped<00:02:10.979> the

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:11.490 
just tapped the

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:13.940 
just tapped the

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
birgit in this case the guy next to him

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.890

and<00:02:14.130> now<00:02:14.520> the<00:02:14.580> app<00:02:14.910> has<00:02:14.940> done<00:02:15.420> all<00:02:15.690> of<00:02:15.720> that

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
and now the app has done all of that

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.690 
and now the app has done all of that
gamer<00:02:16.290> math<00:02:16.590> for<00:02:16.860> me<00:02:16.950> it's<00:02:17.100> figured<00:02:17.400> out<00:02:17.520> what

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
gamer math for me it's figured out what

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.850 
gamer math for me it's figured out what
my<00:02:17.820> chance<00:02:18.150> to<00:02:18.360> hit<00:02:18.540> is<00:02:18.720> how<00:02:19.020> much<00:02:19.200> damage<00:02:19.650> I'm

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
my chance to hit is how much damage I'm

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.040 
my chance to hit is how much damage I'm
likely<00:02:20.310> to<00:02:20.400> do<00:02:20.520> and<00:02:20.730> all<00:02:20.850> of<00:02:21.000> that<00:02:21.150> if<00:02:21.360> I<00:02:21.810> like

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
likely to do and all of that if I like

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:25.100 
likely to do and all of that if I like
with<00:02:22.710> quick<00:02:23.580> press<00:02:23.850> the<00:02:24.060> button<00:02:24.360> I<00:02:24.510> can<00:02:24.840> drill

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
with quick press the button I can drill

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:26.750 
with quick press the button I can drill
in<00:02:25.320> and<00:02:25.560> the<00:02:25.710> Apple<00:02:26.010> then<00:02:26.130> break<00:02:26.340> down<00:02:26.550> exactly

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
in and the Apple then break down exactly

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.310 
in and the Apple then break down exactly
how<00:02:27.240> all<00:02:27.420> those<00:02:27.570> percentages<00:02:27.960> were

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320 
how all those percentages were

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.170 
how all those percentages were
calculated<00:02:29.010> and<00:02:29.160> all<00:02:29.250> that<00:02:29.430> sort<00:02:29.670> of<00:02:29.790> thing<00:02:29.850> so

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
calculated and all that sort of thing so

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.240 
calculated and all that sort of thing so
I<00:02:30.240> can<00:02:30.420> understand<00:02:30.810> the<00:02:30.900> game<00:02:31.050> better<00:02:31.260> now

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
something about the battle or we might

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:17.360 
something about the battle or we might
