00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:06.930
 with friends inside the club so good of 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.670
 a long time ago they have been asking me 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.350
 to upload all the information about what 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:13.049
 that I know of the new update of 

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:16.200
 minecraft pocket edition either 0.6 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:18.180
 points 20 points 7.0 I do not know what it is but 

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:19.530
 well the part system is not what more 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.900
 I care is that they update to how 

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:24.060
 much yes that is what will bring no 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:26.820
 well first of all I want to emphasize 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.400
 this because it happened to me once this is not 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.650
 version 0.7 is not version 0.6 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.390
 point 2 is not version 0.6 point one 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.180
 I'm just going to give information about 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.130
 0 point version is the version 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.690
 leave then that is just information 

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:41.040
 before they start asking me the 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.840
 application here by the description of 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.880
 video as many times I have done 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.890
 when only information passed but good 

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:48.240
 that is a part issue we are here with the 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.360
 Mr. 0 and then we will give you the 

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:53.550
 following information and the changes that 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.830
 they will come in the fire and more than anything 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.900
 the things that are going to add and the things 

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:59.820
 that can come but safer in the 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:02.440
 next update that would be 0.8 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:05.350
 not so good 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:07.690
 we'll start with the interface change or 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:09.490
 the theme or the way of seeing order 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:11.530
 things in the start menu and everything 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:13.080
 that is not going to change all that, that is, 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:15.520
 they are going to give a new interface to the game 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.710
 from the beginning it's going to change everything 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.840
 they will put new options and 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:21.549
 configurations to what the game is 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:24.190
 between the new configurations that 

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:26.320
 they will also put him more than anything 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:28.510
 the difficulty you will be able to change the 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:31.000
 difficulty of the game or to do it 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:33.670
 harder or easier or even the way 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.840
 peaceful but the size of the buttons to 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:36.190
 many have hindered him is all 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.300
 buttons that are very large now the 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:40.310
 you will be able to modify 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:43.160
 that is exposed good that is going to come a 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:44.480
 like that you can say that you're going to 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:47.570
 can make it a bigger smaller 

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:50.970
 because the spot is mod line the laws of 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:54.330
 interface more than anything to improve it 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.680
 the textures of what the map is 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:57.500
 suppose it is coming in test mode 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.850
 but then let's see how it works 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:02.159
 as well 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.869
 will come modifies the modification of 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:06.689
 sky or be able to change the texture 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:07.979
 of the sky and what the water is moving 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:10.140
 you will also be able to change the texture 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:12.120
 this I do not know until so much of good 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.860
 go see how bad you can leave 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:17.280
 I do not know how much you can improve it 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:20.069
 or you can do it or take away the quality 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.569
 but then it's supposed to come 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:23.270
 bar where you can change those 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:24.920
 options 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:27.170
 and with this the map will also come 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.730
 larger and as well well the map 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:30.860
 bigger so next because they will 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:32.390
 put multiplayer is supposed to go now 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:35.210
 to come servers which are going to 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:36.710
 make pay that the creators of the 

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:39.140
 servers or they will pay for 

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:40.670
 create a server this as well they are going to 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:43.160
 have to create an account in wet or 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:45.350
 to enter a server you can enter 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:47.600
 free but to create one if you have it 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:50.330
 that pay they say will come between 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:52.070
 between 8 and 10 dollars what you're worth in 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:54.440
 a server a month this is going to pay 

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:55.700
 through the app store play store I do not know or 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:58.190
 if not directly account 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.840
 they wet everything I do not know how I tell him to create 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:00.920
 your account will be free to enter a 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.840
 server will be free simply 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:05.020
 create a server is going to be what you are going to 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.020
 charge 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.909
 and then obviously the multiplayer is going to come 

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:11.670
 has to come a chat they are not going to add 

00:03:08.909 --> 00:03:13.170
 fought to this from minecraft now yes 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:14.579
 we are going to be talking 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:17.189
 signs now if a chat is coming 

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:18.840
 now what I what I think that that 

00:03:17.189 --> 00:03:20.760
 they should more than anything also 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:23.549
 add an option to remove the chat or 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.720
 is not to see it because then right now 

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:26.849
 I had been entering the games 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:29.310
 of hunger and everything is a servant is the 

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:30.450
 chat clog a lot to play I hope that 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:33.540
 the chat comes an option for 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:35.099
 minimize it or remove it for a while 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:37.079
 while you are playing while not 

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:38.940
 you want to talk more than anything for that 

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:40.680
 because if this if you're playing you can not 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.629
 minimize the chat the truth sometimes to 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:44.700
 sometimes very annoying or see all your 

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:47.040
 white screen of pure letters and that no 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:49.019
 let you play well and not so well 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:51.329
 I hope that option add that is my 

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:52.889
 point of view among the things that are going to 

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:54.959
 add are the buckets more than anything 

00:03:52.889 --> 00:03:56.849
 confirmed I think the buckets is the 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:58.950
 main reason why they started to 

00:03:56.849 --> 00:04:02.670
 the update but that was let's say 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:04.799
 that the reason of which will call both the 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:06.720
 attention and then obviously you will be able to 

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:07.889
 I think that transporting milk will be able to 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:10.410
 remove milk from cows 

00:04:07.889 --> 00:04:11.410
 you're going to be able to move it going to water and what 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:13.210
 you were 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:14.440
 in what I could move with the buckets was 

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:16.480
 can be one all the materials that 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:19.000
 I started but if in some of 

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:20.799
 analyze and then today or with the laws I think 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.290
 that you will be able to create cakes or cakes 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:24.790
 I do not know this if it's already confirmed or 

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:26.470
 single 

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:28.480
 a speculation that those of 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:30.820
 mohamed because I think they added it and 

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:32.950
 are going to come an option that is 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:34.690
 it's not confirmed either but they say 

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:36.070
 coras and eggs will work the 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:37.900
 how I started or is going to increase an egg 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:40.140
 will a chicken come out or will you be able to 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:40.140
 do 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:46.539
 egg cakes but and the egg is going to 

00:04:43.569 --> 00:04:48.490
 start having a function since then 

00:04:46.539 --> 00:04:50.349
 in this minecraft they had not even 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:53.090
 eggs not those are the things more than 

00:04:50.349 --> 00:04:54.860
 nothing that they think to add that they think 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:56.330
 who think to modify and who are more 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:57.919
 how safe is that what I 'm supposed to 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:59.180
 to mention should come in the 

00:04:57.919 --> 00:05:01.910
 next update or are the 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:04.580
 rumors as I tell them I do not know if the 0.6 

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:07.099
 points 2 I do not know if the to 0.7 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:08.479
 to me what matters least is that what 

00:05:07.099 --> 00:05:10.220
 I care is that there should be 

00:05:08.479 --> 00:05:12.349
 got the update now for 

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:13.729
 when the update is supposed to 

00:05:12.349 --> 00:05:15.319
 update should be already 

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:17.840
 now we will see it stop from 

00:05:15.319 --> 00:05:19.879
 April but for the oak and they wanted 

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:22.060
 improve the system so that you already 

00:05:19.879 --> 00:05:24.500
 next exports are faster 

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:27.080
 they have taken a long time now 

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:28.909
 speculations and they said that 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:31.969
 before May 20 and there they will be 

00:05:28.909 --> 00:05:33.139
 rose in this week but it came out a 

00:05:31.969 --> 00:05:34.789
 new rumor out there that they said that 

00:05:33.139 --> 00:05:37.580
 until late May that if I did not I 

00:05:34.789 --> 00:05:39.110
 confirmed more however as that 

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:40.340
 they are saying that you open houses at the end 

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:42.469
 May I do not care about that 

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:45.050
 update before the end of May not 

00:05:42.469 --> 00:05:46.610
 there would be a problem but if you already pass 

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:48.500
 what would already be wet playing with 

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:50.240
 updates and it would not be taking us 

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:52.250
 into account or I would not be taking very into 

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:54.110
 serious this which then it would do that 

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:55.669
 many followers will be angry with me 

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:57.500
 part and I would get angry because then 

00:05:55.669 --> 00:05:58.849
 they are taking a long time I feel that I do not 

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:01.039
 they are giving the output of this project 

00:05:58.849 --> 00:06:02.629
 that should give you more than anything because 

00:06:01.039 --> 00:06:04.759
 the followers and they are giving you a 

00:06:02.629 --> 00:06:06.710
 seriousness to this project which 

00:06:04.759 --> 00:06:08.810
 As always, what is said is lacking a lot 

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:10.250
 be a minecraft itself but then the 

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:11.420
 followers liked it and they are still 

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:14.090
 this project for what 

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:16.640
 soon be like a real micro or 

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:19.580
 as a a mycroft with all its 

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:21.560
 qualities and all other options 

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:23.510
 that other things that have been 

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:24.530
 speculating these if you are not at a hundred 

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:26.840
 sure hundred come to this 

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:28.400
 most update says or until 

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:31.580
 those of nuns I think that they will come out 

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:33.920
 in version 0.8 and they are the table 

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:35.450
 positions the charms table and the network 

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:37.760
 are these materials supposed to be 

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:40.250
 lead to exit at 0.8 or must be in 

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:42.440
 the 0.8 if not that they add some right now 

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:45.140
 at zero point in the demanding 

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:47.480
 update may add one or 

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:49.640
 you wait until 0.8 these are 

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:52.280
 things have been testing her right now 

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:53.870
 those I think are one of the main 

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:55.460
 reasons of which they have not 

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:57.650
 updated because they are testing these 

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:59.930
 options to add celaya to 

00:06:57.650 --> 00:07:01.970
 minecraft that is something very good so what 

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:04.190
 they are doing and if not then of them 

00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:06.169
 They will know that well, nothing friends more than
