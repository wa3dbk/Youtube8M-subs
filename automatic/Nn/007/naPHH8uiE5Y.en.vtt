00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:14.099
 hi dear friend are you watching a video 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.759
 channel on the part of today's short 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:19.380
 video tutorial 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:22.740
 I dedicate tablets acer iconia tab a511 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:25.470
 and more precisely its catrice it means for that 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.869
 to get rid of the graphic 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.510
 key from other troubles which 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.550
 related to the power of loading we need 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.130
 perform hard reset there is it full 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:38.129
 reset factory reset 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:40.739
 to do this we have to do 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.809
 I ask you to take some operations into account. 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.989
 what is lost all custom 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.340
 data if you have this photo 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:52.469
 documents on it 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:53.010
 I think it will be necessary to throw the right 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.050
 all yours 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.420
 take care of this data you there 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.129
 gathered I do not know how it will happen 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.500
 some will do maybe with 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.000
 using a computer or something else or not 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:07.170
 will do hard reset 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.920
 does the procedure of the heads of the discharge a little bit 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:13.560
 different from other similar models 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:16.979
 procedure on a500 even on a500 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:21.450
 different from 200 too different in 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:24.689
 many models involved before this one 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.729
 switch on this model he is not 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:29.040
 involved altogether let's move on 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:31.170
 directly to reset 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.780
 in order to hard reset on 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:36.720
 you need to turn off the tablet to remove the flash drive 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.520
 if you are afraid for data on a flash drive on 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:42.180
 in fact nothing happens to him 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:44.760
 as a rule but for reliability it is possible and 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:47.730
 and and extract means to start 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:49.770
 we need to hold down the volume 

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:53.340
 minus if not mistaken in general with two 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:56.910
 dots now I will say exactly here yes 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.650
 I think we are all well, they were erased 

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:00.390
 by 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:03.210
 Android OS I saw that it 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:06.930
 volume minus hold the volume minus 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:09.350
 and hold down the power button right now 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:12.209
 We look at us first 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:14.220
 vibration signal and 2 vibration signal after 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:15.180
 second vibrate we switch to 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.520
 another button 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:20.580
 volume after it appeared 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:23.220
 inscription in three good mood will be at least 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:26.489
 we release all the buttons and wait for now 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:28.830
 Our utility will appear 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:31.590
 recovery button volume down 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:33.500
 we move to wipe data factory 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:36.060
 reset 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:40.470
 agree and confirm the button 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:43.070
 on and on the second menu that appears 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:47.370
 choose a place litol userdata 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:52.370
 We also confirm with the power button 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:55.860
 that's all I think what's next ideally 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:58.019
 usually do nothing else 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:58.860
 I have to do it now 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:02.489
 formatting 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:04.380
 cleaning completely flash drives 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:07.980
 which is reserved for the operating system 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:12.630
 and fills the firmware factory that which 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:16.200
 had a plant installed on it now 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:19.230
 the second menu appears more precisely the third 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:22.890
 the menu and the final is here 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:23.340
 From this menu, we exit to the reboot system 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:24.959
 now 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:27.269
 choose the first item again 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:31.200
 confirm the power button now 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:35.280
 it will reboot and show first 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:38.640
 operating system screen 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:41.700
 the first screen loved the firmware that 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:43.760
 has been installed in the factory you remain 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:46.440
 just customize the language 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:48.600
 time zone, and the first to perform well, 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:50.010
 Other initial settings I think with 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:53.130
 no one has this question at all 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:54.810
 There will be thank you for looking at this 

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:57.959
 all if the video was not helpful 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:59.639
