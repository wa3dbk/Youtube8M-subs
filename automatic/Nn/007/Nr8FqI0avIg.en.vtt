00:04:23.879 --> 00:04:23.889 
what everyone wanted them to be I think

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:25.469 
what everyone wanted them to be I think
we've<00:04:24.039> really<00:04:24.220> got<00:04:24.490> them<00:04:24.729> to<00:04:24.940> where<00:04:25.150> they

that's<00:04:52.780> exactly<00:04:52.930> what<00:04:53.380> they<00:04:53.500> want<00:04:53.680> to<00:04:53.740> do<00:04:53.979> it

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:54.160 
that's exactly what they want to do it

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:56.189 
that's exactly what they want to do it
seemed<00:04:54.400> the<00:04:55.120> development<00:04:55.600> team<00:04:55.630> themselves

00:04:56.189 --> 00:04:56.199 
seemed the development team themselves

00:04:56.199 --> 00:04:57.900 
seemed the development team themselves
had<00:04:56.350> so<00:04:56.590> many<00:04:56.710> different<00:04:57.010> ideas<00:04:57.490> they<00:04:57.699> didn't

00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:57.910 
had so many different ideas they didn't

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:00.150 
had so many different ideas they didn't
know<00:04:57.970> where<00:04:58.150> to<00:04:58.180> go<00:04:58.360> and<00:04:58.770> eventually<00:04:59.770> they

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:00.160 
know where to go and eventually they

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:01.589 
know where to go and eventually they
decide<00:05:00.460> on<00:05:00.490> well<00:05:00.820> why<00:05:00.970> don't<00:05:01.150> we<00:05:01.180> do<00:05:01.360> all<00:05:01.570> of

00:05:01.589 --> 00:05:01.599 
decide on well why don't we do all of

00:05:01.599 --> 00:05:03.089 
decide on well why don't we do all of
them<00:05:01.870> and<00:05:02.020> try<00:05:02.199> and<00:05:02.320> merge<00:05:02.500> them<00:05:02.530> and<00:05:02.979> then

00:05:03.089 --> 00:05:03.099 
them and try and merge them and then

00:05:03.099 --> 00:05:04.589 
them and try and merge them and then
that<00:05:03.729> way<00:05:03.849> you<00:05:03.880> don't<00:05:04.120> have<00:05:04.180> to<00:05:04.270> force

00:05:04.589 --> 00:05:04.599 
that way you don't have to force

00:05:04.599 --> 00:05:06.719 
that way you don't have to force
gameplay<00:05:05.080> on<00:05:05.620> certain<00:05:05.979> characters<00:05:06.400> and<00:05:06.610> make

00:05:06.719 --> 00:05:06.729 
gameplay on certain characters and make

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:08.760 
gameplay on certain characters and make
you<00:05:06.820> feel<00:05:07.000> awkward<00:05:07.270> we<00:05:07.900> can<00:05:08.080> just<00:05:08.289> match<00:05:08.500> the

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:08.770 
you feel awkward we can just match the

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:10.230 
you feel awkward we can just match the
gameplay<00:05:09.130> to<00:05:09.190> the<00:05:09.400> character<00:05:09.849> and<00:05:10.030> their

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:10.240 
gameplay to the character and their

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:12.290 
gameplay to the character and their
story<00:05:10.479> so<00:05:10.870> everything<00:05:11.349> feels<00:05:11.650> more<00:05:11.919> synthetic

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:12.300 
story so everything feels more synthetic

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:15.360 
story so everything feels more synthetic
more<00:05:13.300> natural<00:05:13.960> in<00:05:14.110> that<00:05:14.229> regard<00:05:14.590> right<00:05:15.010> all
