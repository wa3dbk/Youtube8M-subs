to<00:00:50.290> it<00:00:50.460> when<00:00:51.460> it's<00:00:51.580> like<00:00:52.239> this<00:00:52.269> it<00:00:53.049> is<00:00:53.350> 130

00:00:54.299 --> 00:00:54.309 
to it when it's like this it is 130

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:56.189 
to it when it's like this it is 130
centimeters<00:00:54.820> long<00:00:55.030> and<00:00:55.210> when<00:00:55.869> we<00:00:55.989> set<00:00:56.170> that

00:00:56.189 --> 00:00:56.199 
centimeters long and when we set that

00:00:56.199 --> 00:00:57.990 
centimeters long and when we set that
out<00:00:56.320> which<00:00:56.619> I<00:00:56.710> will<00:00:56.860> do<00:00:56.979> in<00:00:57.100> a<00:00:57.159> second<00:00:57.580> to

00:00:57.990 --> 00:00:58.000 
out which I will do in a second to

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.820 
out which I will do in a second to
convert<00:00:58.299> it<00:00:58.479> into<00:00:58.600> longer<00:00:58.989> bag<00:00:59.199> it<00:00:59.470> goes<00:00:59.589> up<00:00:59.619> to
