how long was the drive for you guys
three<00:00:42.700> and<00:00:42.790> a<00:00:42.820> half<00:00:42.850> hours<00:00:43.390> not<00:00:44.260> that<00:00:44.410> bad

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
three and a half hours not that bad

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.870 
three and a half hours not that bad
exactly<00:00:47.500> we<00:00:47.740> figured<00:00:48.040> we<00:00:48.190> do<00:00:48.310> this<00:00:48.490> one<00:00:48.670> first

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:48.880 
exactly we figured we do this one first

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:51.900 
exactly we figured we do this one first
then<00:00:49.240> next<00:00:49.750> year<00:00:50.020> make<00:00:50.320> the<00:00:50.440> track<00:00:50.730> being<00:00:51.730> from

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:51.910 
then next year make the track being from

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:54.030 
then next year make the track being from
Philadelphia<00:00:52.360> do<00:00:52.510> you<00:00:52.600> see<00:00:52.870> any<00:00:53.110> advantages

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:54.040 
Philadelphia do you see any advantages

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:56.850 
Philadelphia do you see any advantages
as<00:00:54.400> opposed<00:00:54.880> to<00:00:55.210> going<00:00:55.240> to<00:00:55.690> Tennessee<00:00:56.200> it

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:56.860 
as opposed to going to Tennessee it

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:58.680 
as opposed to going to Tennessee it
maybe<00:00:57.400> being<00:00:57.820> a<00:00:57.910> little<00:00:57.940> bit<00:00:58.180> closer<00:00:58.330> to<00:00:58.450> home

00:00:58.680 --> 00:00:58.690 
maybe being a little bit closer to home

maybe being a little bit closer to home
or<00:00:58.960> were<00:00:59.500> there<00:00:59.650> any<00:00:59.830> advantages<00:01:00.370> that<00:01:00.430> you

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:00.760
