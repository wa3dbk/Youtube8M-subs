00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.449
 Hello, how are you? 

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:06.240
 I bring another one of my figures in this case 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:10.769
 I bring you the figure of kits player 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:13.710
 another sprint made of extinction 'just like 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:16.820
 that I am not a collector of figures and 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:20.369
 modern or figures and movies 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:24.090
 but being when buying the other figures 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:25.949
 that you buy of generation or not I could not 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:31.230
 avoid buying me this little stubborn 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:33.920
 so I apologized well can not 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:37.110
 avoid buying me this little man 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:39.840
 this robot is very beautiful that can 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.000
 see how it opens that my little magnet to 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.579
 this maple side that keeps the 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.570
 closed box the back part says that 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:49.489
 has 25 points of joints comes 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.140
 with a set 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:54.210
 of with his sword with his shield and with his 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:58.170
 base to accommodate it I also want what 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:00.239
 I have kept this sernauto set is 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.399
 for in web think he did but I 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.539
 I feel sorry what happens that this 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.409
 this this set 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.899
 he is more attached 

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:11.200
 to the sword and the shield that he used in the 

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:12.819
 movie and this shield and this is good 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.189
 the shield more or less but the sword does not 

00:01:12.819 --> 00:01:16.060
 it looks exactly nothing to what comes out 

00:01:15.189 --> 00:01:18.640
 in the film 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:21.280
 it's more like this then I think that 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:23.799
 at last they decided to throw a pig not 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.810
 I know what the solution was the thing but 

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:28.390
 Well, these gentlemen stayed there 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:31.569
 they gave us pigtails they sold us 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:35.679
 twice the things well this is the 

00:01:31.569 --> 00:01:39.459
 gentlemen is around 130 dollars of 

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:42.549
 135 dollars when and counted did this 

00:01:39.459 --> 00:01:44.229
 Juan with this set has included but if 

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:46.209
 they buy weapons the pure figure the pure 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:48.129
 figure they come grabbing it like in 115 

00:01:46.209 --> 00:01:50.469
 $ 110 and grip it like this 

00:01:48.129 --> 00:01:52.110
 loose as for 20 dollars then here 

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:54.099
 is 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.379
 supposedly where it shows you all the 

00:01:54.099 --> 00:01:58.750
 points of articulation where they are put 

00:01:56.379 --> 00:02:01.509
 the batteries where it is turned on and then how 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:04.180
 build your base let's take out what is your 

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:06.880
 base that is your basis in this part 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:09.780
 is this a pretty metal like 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:13.810
 let's get this out 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:17.580
 and it 's the same since plastic is not metal 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.580
 and let's see what this thing does 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:24.890
 here and this is put in this way 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:27.730
 so that it can not accommodate optimus 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:31.090
 prime and now 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:34.069
 small insurance so that you what 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:37.090
 can accommodate in a way 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:37.090
 and you feel 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:43.540
 Well, let's see if you're gentlemen, let's see 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:43.540
 what it is now optimus prime 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:03:00.310
 and here comes car is a beautiful figure 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:02.530
 Gentlemen, see how this good comes 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:06.850
 detailed I love this part of how 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:10.530
 it looks is extremely beautiful this 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:14.200
 figure does justice to the figure of 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:15.790
 What is the movie is good for 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:19.150
 this one can wield comes with its weapons 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:22.060
 that where I can wield the swords this one 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:25.060
 comes with a set of hands where they can 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:28.370
 put any sword that is already 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:32.299
 comes with another set where it comes with 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:35.420
 open hands there is and then this 

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:38.190
 comes also crazy with this shield that 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:41.460
 You can put it this way here 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:43.770
 in this way is put in struggle this 

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:46.590
 way that has a poster where it gets 

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:48.750
 Pressed and ready so it remains to be able 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:51.300
 here it turns on what are your blues of 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:54.630
 spotlights the only one that has led spotlights 

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:57.000
 from the eyes and then it does not come 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:59.940
 with more this let's get out what is the 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:03.970
 the set we're going to take this one to remove 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:06.660
 this fist is removed in this way 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:06.660
 respect it 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:15.040
 and thing is too smart 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:17.819
 let's grab what this set is 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:17.819
 we put in the same way 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:27.560
 He told me that it is good future 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:39.010
 as I put the red is east of the 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:41.250
 pressure that comes with this to wield 

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:44.200
 the most right sword because with this 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:47.950
 with this is the sword 

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:49.900
 has supposedly the purpose of how 

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:53.050
 he wants to point the sword to someone 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:54.910
 let's see it because the first thing about 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:57.190
 which are the legs has very good 

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:59.530
 articulation here in the heel that 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:01.450
 move to the old right hand as well 

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:03.820
 all this is the head up towards 

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:06.030
 down we are going to put it first of this 

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:08.690
 shape 

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:12.860
 yes although let's get out what is the set 

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:12.860
 that is here let's take it out 

00:05:14.689 --> 00:05:19.489
 and here we see what is this shield and 

00:05:18.259 --> 00:05:23.329
 this shield is supposedly 

00:05:19.489 --> 00:05:25.879
 saying that it opens in this way and it 

00:05:23.329 --> 00:05:27.649
 stretch this part and already a willing 

00:05:25.879 --> 00:05:29.350
 can put in what is in this part 

00:05:27.649 --> 00:05:34.090
 from here 

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:37.690
 and we 're going to give you one found in 

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:39.120
 sanity so that you look like you 

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:43.830
 is 

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:43.830
 the one who is like that protecting 

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:52.800
 then in this way 

00:05:48.169 --> 00:05:57.800
 ready and we grabbed our sword 

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:57.800
 his parents can be put to this form 

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:05.790
 and the fun of this figure is what 

00:06:06.289 --> 00:06:11.809
 it's like he's pointing at someone 

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:13.819
 with the sword is not a very figure 

00:06:11.809 --> 00:06:18.379
 pretty can you see there 

00:06:13.819 --> 00:06:19.800
 gentlemen is totally articulated and I the 

00:06:18.379 --> 00:06:22.830
 true 

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:24.590
 I am very happy with him with the design 

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:27.270
 of these figures I can not put 

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:29.630
 absolutely some but we can put 

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:32.620
 the figure either in this form 

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:35.600
 stop him as if he were 

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:39.410
 floating in the air can see how it 

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:43.340
 you see this figure beautiful in this way what 

00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:45.380
 they are going to eat a lot of 

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:46.790
 positions but it is freezing 

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:48.650
 only today I'm going to put you so that 

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:50.930

 and can you appreciate what is the 

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:55.060
 figure
