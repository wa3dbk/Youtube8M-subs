because of the mucus in them so what we
can<00:00:58.100> do<00:00:58.280> on<00:00:58.310> that<00:00:58.490> is<00:00:58.700> utilize<00:00:59.329> like<00:00:59.600> a<00:00:59.630> bulb

00:00:59.980 --> 00:00:59.990 
can do on that is utilize like a bulb

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:02.980 
can do on that is utilize like a bulb
syringe<00:01:00.260> to<00:01:01.220> go<00:01:01.730> ahead<00:01:02.000> and<00:01:02.120> aspirate<00:01:02.660> some<00:01:02.900> of

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:11.780 
aspiration back out so depressing the

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.080 
aspiration back out so depressing the
