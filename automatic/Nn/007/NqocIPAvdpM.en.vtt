vegetables like celery or carrots should

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.359 
vegetables like celery or carrots should
be<00:01:17.969> a<00:01:17.999> little<00:01:18.210> smaller<00:01:18.659> if<00:01:19.049> you're<00:01:19.350> all<00:01:19.679> you

ingredients like the summer squash and
and<00:01:28.229> that<00:01:29.009> kind<00:01:29.310> i<00:01:29.369> have<00:01:29.399> my<00:01:29.880> brush<00:01:30.210> for

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.950 
and that kind i have my brush for
brushing<00:01:31.409> mixture<00:01:31.890> i<00:01:31.920> have<00:01:32.460> metal<00:01:33.390> skewers<00:01:33.840> I

brushing mixture i have metal skewers I

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.080 
brushing mixture i have metal skewers I
think<00:01:34.170> metal<00:01:34.469> skewers<00:01:34.950> work<00:01:35.399> the<00:01:35.579> best<00:01:35.789> you

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
think metal skewers work the best you

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.239 
think metal skewers work the best you
can<00:01:36.329> use<00:01:36.630> wooden<00:01:36.960> ones<00:01:37.200> but<00:01:37.380> you<00:01:37.439> have<00:01:37.560> to<00:01:37.920> soak

00:01:38.239 --> 00:01:38.249 
can use wooden ones but you have to soak

00:01:38.249 --> 00:01:40.999 
can use wooden ones but you have to soak
them<00:01:38.549> and<00:01:38.850> then<00:01:39.630> i<00:01:39.659> have<00:01:39.780> my<00:01:40.049> broiling<00:01:40.770> pan

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
them and then i have my broiling pan

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:45.260 
them and then i have my broiling pan
here<00:01:41.609> this<00:01:41.819> is<00:01:41.999> a<00:01:42.350> slotted<00:01:43.350> pen<00:01:43.890> tray<00:01:44.280> and<00:01:44.700> it

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
here this is a slotted pen tray and it

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.260 
here this is a slotted pen tray and it
has<00:01:45.450> a<00:01:45.479> pan<00:01:45.929> underneath<00:01:46.380> and<00:01:46.889> most<00:01:47.579> toaster

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
has a pan underneath and most toaster

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.359 
has a pan underneath and most toaster
ovens<00:01:48.569> come<00:01:48.899> with<00:01:49.109> this<00:01:49.319> arrangement<00:01:49.649> so<00:01:50.310> you

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
ovens come with this arrangement so you

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.840 
ovens come with this arrangement so you
should<00:01:50.789> probably<00:01:50.819> have<00:01:51.479> one<00:01:51.689> of<00:01:51.810> those<00:01:52.189> so<00:01:53.189> the

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
should probably have one of those so the

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.959 
should probably have one of those so the
brushing<00:01:54.329> mixture<00:01:54.899> is<00:01:55.139> three<00:01:56.039> tablespoons<00:01:56.759> of

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
brushing mixture is three tablespoons of

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:01.690 
brushing mixture is three tablespoons of
olive<00:01:57.149> oil<00:01:57.889> 1<00:01:58.889> tablespoon<00:01:59.670> of<00:01:59.939> soy<00:02:00.240> sauce<00:02:00.600> 1

vinegar and then salt and pepper to

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.640 
vinegar and then salt and pepper to
taste<00:02:12.600> and<00:02:13.050> I<00:02:13.170> think<00:02:13.410> I<00:02:13.530> put<00:02:13.830> in<00:02:14.010> just<00:02:14.310> a

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
taste and I think I put in just a

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:16.559

broil these look just lovely now the

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:22.160 
broil these look just lovely now the
gist<00:04:18.410> behind<00:04:19.410> this<00:04:19.769> whole<00:04:20.160> thing<00:04:20.780> is<00:04:21.780> that

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:22.170 
gist behind this whole thing is that

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:25.340 
gist behind this whole thing is that
unlike<00:04:22.560> steam<00:04:23.010> to<00:04:23.280> bed<00:04:23.460> vegetables<00:04:24.390> and<00:04:24.720> if

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:25.350 
unlike steam to bed vegetables and if

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:27.920 
unlike steam to bed vegetables and if
you<00:04:25.500> don't<00:04:25.740> have<00:04:25.980> a<00:04:26.010> grill<00:04:26.400> you<00:04:27.390> get<00:04:27.540> the<00:04:27.690> same

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:27.930 
you don't have a grill you get the same

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:32.090 
you don't have a grill you get the same
effect<00:04:28.130> because<00:04:29.540> that<00:04:30.540> 40<00:04:31.170> minutes<00:04:31.500> baking

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:32.100 
effect because that 40 minutes baking

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:37.840 
effect because that 40 minutes baking
has<00:04:33.830> concentrated<00:04:34.830> the<00:04:35.070> juices<00:04:35.610> in<00:04:36.420> the

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:37.850 
has concentrated the juices in the

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:41.210 
has concentrated the juices in the
vegetables<00:04:38.850> and<00:04:39.000> made<00:04:39.270> them<00:04:39.480> tender<00:04:39.990> oh<00:04:40.230> just
