00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:08.929
 in this video I come to show you a tweet 

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:11.070
 that makes me very father is this 

00:00:08.929 --> 00:00:14.110
 same for the name of wifi 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:18.400
 how the truth is pronounced what we 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:23.070
 do see images on our iphone in 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:23.070
 him as you can see here on the reel 

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:29.270
 for bikers bikers and you know a 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:33.040
 image is going to look like this 

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:33.040
 no movement even if it's jeep 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:43.059
 it's good to see images that move 

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:43.059
 Now he shows us how he is 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:49.579
 has some books this tweet yet 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:52.060
 the creator in an update is better 

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:56.380
 that locks 

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:59.730
 as you can see there we visualize hiv 

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:59.730
 it's basically everything 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.190
 no this 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:09.770
 how can you see 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:11.610
 in images that are longer take more 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:14.850
 charge time 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:17.520
 really I do not know why 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.979
 and how do you want to move from one side 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.490
 from one image to another image it takes for 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.490
 Load more 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:31.299
 and this one, basically, that's all that 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:33.729
 allows us to do that now I show you 

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:37.420
 about what I 'm talking about when I tell you about 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:39.940
 the images for example here I have this 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:43.110
 they will have a bowl 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:43.110
 as you can see there it locked 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:49.370
 look there it happens well 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:53.020
 and now it happens to the other 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:53.020
 that afternoon to load a little more 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:59.509
 no this 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:04.369
 it's a longer one as I tell you this tweet 

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:06.790
 it's so cool what to do is that 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:09.739
 only compatible with air 5 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:11.870
 superior superior to air 5 good 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:15.200
 that is practically what allows us 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:18.410
 do this tweet and see images in 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:21.500
 our phone from our iphone 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:23.330
 Sorry, I hope you liked this one 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:27.980

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:30.470
 or suggestion do not forget to say it with 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:33.140
 I'll answer 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:37.390
 and that's all about this tweet 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:37.390
 until the next ciao
