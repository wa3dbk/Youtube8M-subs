00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 and then to all condemned and today 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:07.680
 I bring a new mode for version 1.6 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:09.929
 point 4 of minecraft of the abyss I'm not 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.509
 tired of lapis lazuli only serve 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.519
 for nonsense in the game or the 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.789
 obsidian except to make the portal 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:20.430
 of the cne see what else it can serve 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:23.369
 Well, with pencil we can use the 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:26.010
 obsidian lapis lazuli and we can 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:29.690
 create us a new material with these two 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:35.520
 elements to make us armor 

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:40.460
 and swords very very strong well as you see 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:43.700
 well this is so for art is fan to see 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:43.700
 texture pack 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:54.020
 As you can see we can do everything in 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:57.110
 lapis lazuli armor 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:01:00.440
 we can also make ourselves sword all 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:01.990
 the tools and others like it's done in 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.670
 the ingots of lapis lazuli 

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:07.100
 we will need six of the vibrations in 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:09.050
 this position that will give us an ingot 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.720
 ok with these ingots are the ones that 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:15.140
 we can make all the armors and 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:18.700
 the weapons then we have the gems of 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:22.220
 lapis lazuli we will make a pencil cross 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:23.870
 ingots of lapis lazuli and they will give us the 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:27.440
 gems 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:31.280
 we can make ourselves a double double ax 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:34.460
 edge with 8 attack is worth two 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:37.340
 sticks and 5 gems worth these are the 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:39.070
 basic mods that must be the characters 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:44.110
 basic you should know about the stack 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:48.580
 then we have and we have obsidian 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:48.580
 well with the targets and we can do 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:56.240
 an entire armor is worth the obsidian 

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:59.000
 it's iron type of strength they have not given 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:01.759
 as if it were a diamond that they have 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.560
 left for the other mineral but in this 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:06.530
 we can only do blocks of 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:08.330
 obsidian or obsidian armor is worth and 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:11.660
 good the blocks will receive are made with 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:14.950
 when the and vienna and the ingots of 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.950
 obsidian gets 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.530
 obsidian 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:26.240
 we put them in the oven 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:28.690
 with charcoal and we will be giving ingots this 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:31.130
 what you see is in the 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:33.590
 if you are interested 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:35.710
 I will leave the link of the law video because 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:40.010
 you can download it in the description 

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:42.530
 together with forte 16.4 and the link of 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:45.770
 Download this voucher 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:48.830
 then how do we make this material 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:52.280
 We need to do all this gem 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:54.170
 of lapis lazuli a block of obsidian in 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:57.120
 the medium and it will give us this mineral vale 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:03:00.860
 this mineral what we have to do is 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:04.220
 and take it and put it in the oven 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:06.960
 it took a little longer than obsidian but 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:08.820
 will give us these ingots worth 

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:11.010
 with these ingots we can do the 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:14.160
 armor as it is always created without any 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:17.010
 problem for weapons as you see the 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:19.010
 sword has 12 attack damage on 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:22.680
 ax 11 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:26.819
 the peak 10 the shovel 9 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:28.680
 I do not know how to craft ea with sticks and not with iron 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:31.709
 then we will need to do with two 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:33.359
 iron ingots he will give us rods and 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:35.790
 with these things we can make a 

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:39.520
 sword or others that you are 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:41.910
 just put these ingots in 

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:43.950
 crystal 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:45.730
 crystal obsidian good crack and in 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:47.660
 West, I say 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:50.910
 it's like 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:52.980
 obsidian tears 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:55.950
 these ingots in tears 26 targets with 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:58.350
 ie irons bars 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:02.640
 iron rather than sticks and we'll 

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:05.790
 the swords and other good if you know how 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:07.590
 this sumo gets any of the 1.54 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:09.930
 you just have to put it 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:11.849
 in the folder over our point 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:13.530
 minecraft is worth in case you do not know 

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:16.109
 now I'm going to move on to see how it gets installed 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:17.970
 pro merchants have you a 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:21.299
 video of how the forge is installed 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:23.430
 necessary to install the mods 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:25.440
 in a video of the cne and to be able 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:30.530
 download it and see it also with 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:30.530
 a review of 1.6 photo 4 and then 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:37.199
 the download link of the lapis is better 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:39.569
 we do not see you now and well guys we are going to 

00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:41.250
 move on to how it is installed from the abyss vale 

00:04:39.569 --> 00:04:43.470
 The first thing you will need is to have the 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:46.500
 minecraft with the forge installed in the 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:48.700
 version 1.6 point 4 and then this file 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:50.350
 of the Aprismo 

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:52.600
 see that this expression rule 

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:54.310
 download I already know that I am repetitive but 

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:56.440
 just in case you skip any part of the 

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:59.290
 effects video well then we'll go 

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:01.060
 to install it or we give the button 

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:02.740
 Start of our desktop or 

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:05.020
 simply the windows button of 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:07.810
 our keyboard is worth in this screen 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:10.480
 we will write app percent data 

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:13.210
 so much percent here we sell to roaming 

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:15.520
 roaming to the point minecraft and here 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:18.190
 masters mods the house we already know that 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:20.590
 appears only installing the jorge 1.6 

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:22.830
 points 4 is worth these scams that you see 

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:26.750
 here are the king's 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:30.520
 for this mod is not necessary I do not 

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:34.830
 I have to download this 

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:36.930
 but I leave it in a link of the value 

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:38.440
 we will need to copy this file 

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:40.900
 here 

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:43.260
 it's as simple as this to start the 

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:43.260
 Minecraft 

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:49.250

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:52.770

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:54.810
 completely put 

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:56.090
 here you see part of texture that is 

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:59.150
 installed 

00:05:56.090 --> 00:06:01.730
 and if we come here and we give mod 

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:02.630
