00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.589 
it seems to be the overpowered game
modes<00:00:27.779> that<00:00:28.140> I'm<00:00:29.010> are<00:00:29.580> being<00:00:29.820> hacked<00:00:30.119> like

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
modes that I'm are being hacked like

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.260 
modes that I'm are being hacked like
domination<00:00:31.410> Kill<00:00:31.619> Confirmed<00:00:32.149> that's<00:00:33.149> why

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
domination Kill Confirmed that's why

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.360 
domination Kill Confirmed that's why
people<00:00:33.450> don't<00:00:33.780> play<00:00:33.989> that<00:00:34.020> much<00:00:34.380> and<00:00:35.070> then<00:00:35.250> you

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
people don't play that much and then you

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.010 
people don't play that much and then you
just<00:00:35.550> go<00:00:35.670> on<00:00:35.700> TD<00:00:36.120> and<00:00:36.420> then<00:00:36.570> you<00:00:36.690> have<00:00:36.870> never

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
just go on TD and then you have never

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.200 
just go on TD and then you have never
know<00:00:37.230> as<00:00:37.440> far<00:00:37.620> so<00:00:37.950> obviously<00:00:38.730> someone<00:00:39.120> is

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
about this i know pc games are the most

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:13.340 
about this i know pc games are the most
hacked<00:01:09.299> like<00:01:09.810> um<00:01:10.820> whenever<00:01:11.820> hacked<00:01:12.659> games<00:01:12.990> but

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
hacked like um whenever hacked games but

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:14.929 
hacked like um whenever hacked games but
seriously<00:01:13.890> you<00:01:14.250> have<00:01:14.369> to<00:01:14.430> do<00:01:14.580> something<00:01:14.820> about

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
seriously you have to do something about

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.300 
seriously you have to do something about
it<00:01:15.090> instead<00:01:15.270> of<00:01:15.570> just<00:01:15.950> think<00:01:16.950> about<00:01:17.070> your

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
it instead of just think about your

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.190 
it instead of just think about your
frettin<00:01:17.640> console<00:01:18.150> it's<00:01:18.390> just<00:01:18.600> not<00:01:18.810> even<00:01:19.020> fair

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
frettin console it's just not even fair

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.350 
frettin console it's just not even fair

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
so see it doesn't even it's not even

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.830 
so see it doesn't even it's not even
fair<00:01:21.900> i<00:01:22.610> led<00:01:23.610> after<00:01:23.850> yet<00:01:24.119> the<00:01:24.270> near<00:01:24.540> the<00:01:24.630> end<00:01:24.750> of

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.999 
this video i get confronted on being
hacking<00:01:27.390> or<00:01:27.689> whatever<00:01:27.960> just<00:01:28.500> because<00:01:28.799> this

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
hacking or whatever just because this

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.219 
hacking or whatever just because this
guy<00:01:29.159> doesn't<00:01:29.340> know<00:01:29.430> what's<00:01:29.670> going<00:01:29.729> on<00:01:29.939> both

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
basically the bod is really really

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.149 
basically the bod is really really
simple<00:01:33.630> or<00:01:33.900> the<00:01:33.960> hack<00:01:34.140> is<00:01:34.290> really<00:01:34.530> simple<00:01:34.770> what

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
simple or the hack is really simple what

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.039 
simple or the hack is really simple what
they<00:01:35.310> do<00:01:35.369> you<00:01:35.939> can<00:01:36.119> really<00:01:36.299> tell<00:01:36.600> but

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
they do you can really tell but

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.590 
they do you can really tell but

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
basically do you just have no teammates

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.630 
basically do you just have no teammates
like<00:01:39.990> d<00:01:40.229> just<00:01:40.470> replace<00:01:40.890> the<00:01:41.040> teammates<00:01:41.430> where

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
like d just replace the teammates where

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.789 
like d just replace the teammates where
enemies<00:01:42.060> but<00:01:42.540> you<00:01:42.720> just<00:01:42.899> can't<00:01:43.079> kill<00:01:43.350> them<00:01:43.500> are

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
enemies but you just can't kill them are

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:47.240 
enemies but you just can't kill them are
whenever<00:01:44.930> it's<00:01:45.930> kind<00:01:46.200> of<00:01:46.290> stupid<00:01:46.500> really<00:01:46.890> and

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
whenever it's kind of stupid really and

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.760 
whenever it's kind of stupid really and
