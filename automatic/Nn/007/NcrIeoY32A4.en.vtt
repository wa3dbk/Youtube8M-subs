with more living spaces then sort of the

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:02.860 
with more living spaces then sort of the
constraints<00:03:00.680> of<00:03:00.800> our<00:03:00.980> 1987<00:03:01.970> house<00:03:02.090> had<00:03:02.360> the

idea was to extend the deck all the way
around<00:03:04.760> to<00:03:05.090> the<00:03:05.330> far<00:03:05.540> end<00:03:05.780> of<00:03:05.900> the<00:03:05.930> house<00:03:06.140> and

around to the far end of the house and
then<00:03:06.950> put<00:03:07.130> a<00:03:07.160> hot<00:03:07.400> tub<00:03:07.640> out<00:03:08.060> on<00:03:08.570> the<00:03:08.810> back<00:03:08.989> the

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:09.830 
then put a hot tub out on the back the

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:12.400 
then put a hot tub out on the back the
thing<00:03:10.070> that<00:03:10.280> that<00:03:10.640> is<00:03:10.930> always<00:03:11.930> best<00:03:12.140> about

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:12.410 
thing that that is always best about

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:14.830 
thing that that is always best about
working<00:03:12.470> with<00:03:12.769> Daniel's<00:03:13.250> is<00:03:13.600> getting<00:03:14.600> to<00:03:14.720> work

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840 
working with Daniel's is getting to work

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.830 
working with Daniel's is getting to work
with<00:03:14.920> Ted's<00:03:15.920> imagination<00:03:16.700> and<00:03:16.910> intense

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 
with Ted's imagination and intense

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:22.180 
with Ted's imagination and intense
design<00:03:18.380> ideas<00:03:19.180> like<00:03:20.180> I<00:03:20.209> said<00:03:20.360> there<00:03:20.750> I'm<00:03:21.650> not<00:03:22.130> a

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.190 
design ideas like I said there I'm not a

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:24.040 
design ideas like I said there I'm not a
contractor<00:03:22.880> my<00:03:23.150> brain<00:03:23.420> doesn't<00:03:23.600> work<00:03:23.810> that

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:24.050 
contractor my brain doesn't work that

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:25.960 
contractor my brain doesn't work that
way<00:03:24.230> doesn't<00:03:24.470> think<00:03:24.739> that<00:03:24.890> way<00:03:24.950> and<00:03:25.310> I<00:03:25.760> could

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970 
way doesn't think that way and I could

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:27.400 
way doesn't think that way and I could
kind<00:03:26.090> of<00:03:26.239> say<00:03:26.390> you<00:03:26.450> know<00:03:26.660> I'm<00:03:26.780> thinking<00:03:26.810> about

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:27.410 
kind of say you know I'm thinking about

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:30.340 
kind of say you know I'm thinking about
this<00:03:27.650> and<00:03:28.010> this<00:03:28.160> and<00:03:28.750> he<00:03:29.750> would<00:03:29.900> come<00:03:30.080> up<00:03:30.200> with

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:30.350 
this and this and he would come up with

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:32.770 
this and this and he would come up with
it<00:03:30.500> so<00:03:30.950> that's<00:03:31.459> always<00:03:31.670> been<00:03:32.239> the<00:03:32.360> best<00:03:32.480> part

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:32.780 
it so that's always been the best part

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:35.830 
it so that's always been the best part
is<00:03:32.930> kind<00:03:33.200> of<00:03:33.320> being<00:03:33.830> able<00:03:34.130> to<00:03:34.570> sort<00:03:35.570> of<00:03:35.660> have

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:35.840 
is kind of being able to sort of have

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.900 
is kind of being able to sort of have
these<00:03:36.019> beginning<00:03:36.530> ideas<00:03:37.070> of<00:03:37.280> your<00:03:37.459> vision<00:03:37.790> of

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:37.910 
these beginning ideas of your vision of

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:40.270 
these beginning ideas of your vision of
what<00:03:38.060> do<00:03:38.120> you<00:03:38.180> want<00:03:38.390> it<00:03:38.480> to<00:03:38.600> be<00:03:38.630> and<00:03:39.050> then<00:03:39.440> it

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:40.280 
what do you want it to be and then it

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:42.670 
what do you want it to be and then it
happens
