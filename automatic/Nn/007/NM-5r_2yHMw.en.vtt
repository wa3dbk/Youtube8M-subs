00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:15.110 
a very dirty setting it's just got a

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:17.469 
a very dirty setting it's just got a
tiny<00:01:15.439> bit<00:01:15.680> of<00:01:15.799> grit<00:01:16.189> to<00:01:16.219> it<00:01:16.520> we<00:01:16.880> can<00:01:17.060> still<00:01:17.299> get

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:17.479 
tiny bit of grit to it we can still get

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:19.600 
tiny bit of grit to it we can still get
a<00:01:17.539> good<00:01:17.750> bridge<00:01:18.170> sound<00:01:18.530> if<00:01:18.799> we<00:01:18.950> turned<00:01:19.159> up<00:01:19.340> the

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:19.610 
a good bridge sound if we turned up the

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:21.520 
a good bridge sound if we turned up the
you<00:01:20.210> know<00:01:20.299> kind<00:01:20.570> of<00:01:20.719> dirt<00:01:20.869> settings<00:01:21.320> it<00:01:21.500> can

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:21.530 
you know kind of dirt settings it can

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:22.899 
you know kind of dirt settings it can
get<00:01:21.710> really<00:01:21.950> crunchy<00:01:22.399> but<00:01:22.549> here<00:01:22.700> it'll<00:01:22.850> be

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:22.909 
get really crunchy but here it'll be

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:39.500 
get really crunchy but here it'll be
just<00:01:23.149> a<00:01:23.210> little<00:01:23.390> more<00:01:23.539> subtle

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:39.510 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:41.700 

you<00:01:40.510> said<00:01:40.720> you<00:01:40.810> found<00:01:40.930> a<00:01:41.080> pretty<00:01:41.290> feedback

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:41.710 
you said you found a pretty feedback

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:43.620 
you said you found a pretty feedback
resistant<00:01:42.220> at<00:01:42.400> higher<00:01:42.760> volumes<00:01:43.060> as<00:01:43.270> well<00:01:43.420> I

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:43.630 
resistant at higher volumes as well I

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:45.570 
resistant at higher volumes as well I
mean<00:01:44.170> certainly<00:01:44.560> if<00:01:44.800> you<00:01:44.890> get<00:01:45.040> into<00:01:45.340> serious

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:45.580 
mean certainly if you get into serious

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:47.520 
mean certainly if you get into serious

high-gain with a hollow body like this

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:48.660 
high-gain with a hollow body like this
you're<00:01:47.740> going<00:01:47.890> to<00:01:47.980> get<00:01:48.100> some<00:01:48.340> sort<00:01:48.610> of

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:48.670 
you're going to get some sort of

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:51.000 
you're going to get some sort of
feedback<00:01:48.930> however<00:01:49.930> in<00:01:50.140> most<00:01:50.290> of<00:01:50.500> our<00:01:50.620> tests

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:51.010 
feedback however in most of our tests

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:52.800 
feedback however in most of our tests
most<00:01:51.190> of<00:01:51.310> our<00:01:51.430> playing<00:01:51.670> giving<00:01:52.270> a<00:01:52.360> TARDIS<00:01:52.720> and
