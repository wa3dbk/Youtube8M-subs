black piece underneath it and from this

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.100 
black piece underneath it and from this
piece<00:00:32.669> and<00:00:32.910> this<00:00:33.030> piece<00:00:33.090> you're<00:00:33.899> going<00:00:34.020> to

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
piece and this piece you're going to

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.389 
piece and this piece you're going to
keep<00:00:34.260> them<00:00:34.410> certain<00:00:34.710> pieces<00:00:34.920> like<00:00:35.190> this

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
from here to here because that's the

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.049 
from here to here because that's the
front<00:00:40.500> where<00:00:40.680> the<00:00:40.739> white<00:00:40.890> bitters<00:00:41.250> so<00:00:41.850> you<00:00:41.910> do

front where the white bitters so you do

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:52.459 
front where the white bitters so you do
it<00:00:42.180> from<00:00:42.329> the<00:00:42.450> back<00:00:50.899> and<00:00:51.899> I'm<00:00:52.020> just<00:00:52.199> going<00:00:52.350> to

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
it from the back and I'm just going to

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:58.910 
it from the back and I'm just going to
change<00:00:52.620> these<00:00:52.890> yellow<00:00:53.129> to<00:00:53.370> but<00:00:57.559> then<00:00:58.559> for<00:00:58.829> the

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
change these yellow to but then for the

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.160 
change these yellow to but then for the
second<00:00:59.190> row<00:00:59.370> the<00:01:00.239> sides<00:01:00.480> are<00:01:00.600> going<00:01:00.750> to<00:01:00.809> go<00:01:00.899> and

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
second row the sides are going to go and

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.020 
second row the sides are going to go and
diagonally<00:01:01.829> so<00:01:02.370> I'm<00:01:02.460> just<00:01:02.640> going<00:01:02.789> to<00:01:02.879> use<00:01:03.000> your

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
diagonally so I'm just going to use your

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.070 
diagonally so I'm just going to use your
pieces<00:01:03.629> for<00:01:03.809> the<00:01:03.870> side<00:01:04.080> so<00:01:04.260> you<00:01:04.320> can<00:01:04.439> see<00:01:06.080> so

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
pieces for the side so you can see so

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.210 
pieces for the side so you can see so
you're<00:01:07.170> going<00:01:07.290> to<00:01:07.350> put<00:01:07.470> a<00:01:07.500> piece<00:01:07.710> here<00:01:07.979> and

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
you're going to put a piece here and

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.000 
you're going to put a piece here and
here<00:01:08.460> so<00:01:08.700> it's<00:01:09.390> coming<00:01:09.689> undiagnosed<00:01:10.350> then

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
here so it's coming undiagnosed then

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.050 
here so it's coming undiagnosed then
you're<00:01:11.130> going<00:01:11.220> to<00:01:11.310> phone<00:01:11.460> the<00:01:11.640> rest<00:01:11.820> of<00:01:11.939> the

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
you're going to phone the rest of the

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:22.249 
you're going to phone the rest of the
row<00:01:12.210> with<00:01:12.420> it

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.539 

so<00:01:23.259> that<00:01:23.409> first<00:01:23.590> road<00:01:23.829> reboot<00:01:24.159> was<00:01:24.340> nine

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:24.549 
so that first road reboot was nine

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:26.819 
so that first road reboot was nine
pieces<00:01:25.000> and<00:01:25.270> the<00:01:25.840> second<00:01:26.229> row<00:01:26.380> was<00:01:26.619> eight

00:01:26.819 --> 00:01:26.829 
pieces and the second row was eight

00:01:26.829 --> 00:01:28.469 
pieces and the second row was eight
pieces<00:01:27.070> now<00:01:27.700> we're<00:01:27.850> going<00:01:27.970> to<00:01:28.030> make<00:01:28.180> a<00:01:28.210> third

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:28.479 
pieces now we're going to make a third

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:30.539 
pieces now we're going to make a third
row<00:01:28.720> so<00:01:29.380> I<00:01:29.409> might<00:01:29.619> have<00:01:29.740> seen<00:01:29.920> two<00:01:30.100> rows<00:01:30.310> but

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:30.549 
row so I might have seen two rows but

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:32.340 
row so I might have seen two rows but
there's<00:01:30.729> actually<00:01:30.820> three<00:01:31.270> rows<00:01:31.479> but<00:01:32.080> in<00:01:32.200> the

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:32.350 
there's actually three rows but in the

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:34.010 
there's actually three rows but in the
third<00:01:32.530> row<00:01:32.770> you're<00:01:32.979> gonna<00:01:33.070> have<00:01:33.280> nine<00:01:33.490> pieces

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
third row you're gonna have nine pieces

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.840 
third row you're gonna have nine pieces
so<00:01:35.020> you<00:01:35.110> can<00:01:35.229> insert<00:01:35.590> differently<00:01:36.100> so<00:01:36.549> instead

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:36.850 
so you can insert differently so instead

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:38.999 
so you can insert differently so instead
of<00:01:36.909> putting<00:01:37.149> a<00:01:37.299> piece<00:01:37.479> in<00:01:37.720> like<00:01:37.750> that<00:01:38.110> through

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:39.009 
of putting a piece in like that through

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:41.789 
of putting a piece in like that through
the<00:01:39.130> side<00:01:39.340> dozen<00:01:39.700> diagonally<00:01:40.619> you're<00:01:41.619> gonna

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:41.799 
the side dozen diagonally you're gonna

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:43.410 
the side dozen diagonally you're gonna
put<00:01:41.979> it<00:01:42.070> in<00:01:42.189> the<00:01:42.280> side<00:01:42.460> pocket<00:01:42.850> of<00:01:42.939> this<00:01:43.149> piece

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:43.420 
put it in the side pocket of this piece

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:46.169 
put it in the side pocket of this piece
and<00:01:43.780> this<00:01:44.079> piece<00:01:44.200> so<00:01:44.679> this<00:01:45.460> inner<00:01:45.700> point<00:01:46.000> is

00:01:46.169 --> 00:01:46.179 
and this piece so this inner point is

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:48.449 
and this piece so this inner point is
going<00:01:46.390> to<00:01:46.479> go<00:01:46.600> in<00:01:46.810> this<00:01:46.929> piece<00:01:47.200> and<00:01:47.530> the<00:01:48.310> outer

00:01:48.449 --> 00:01:48.459 
going to go in this piece and the outer

00:01:48.459 --> 00:01:53.149 
going to go in this piece and the outer
point<00:01:48.789> is<00:01:49.000> going<00:01:49.149> to<00:01:49.209> slide<00:01:49.450> into<00:01:49.659> this<00:01:49.899> piece

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.199 

so<00:01:54.159> that's<00:01:54.280> going<00:01:54.459> to<00:01:54.549> make<00:01:54.670> a<00:01:54.700> straight<00:01:54.970> edge

00:01:55.199 --> 00:01:55.209 
so that's going to make a straight edge

00:01:55.209 --> 00:01:57.749 
so that's going to make a straight edge
so<00:01:55.810> do<00:01:55.990> that<00:01:56.140> on<00:01:56.200> both<00:01:56.530> sides<00:01:56.860> then<00:01:57.369> fill<00:01:57.640> in

00:01:57.749 --> 00:01:57.759 
so do that on both sides then fill in

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:04.440 
so do that on both sides then fill in
the<00:01:57.850> rest<00:01:58.000> of<00:01:58.149> the<00:01:58.299> row<00:02:02.909> so<00:02:03.909> you<00:02:04.060> should<00:02:04.299> have

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 
the rest of the row so you should have

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:10.889 
the rest of the row so you should have
nine<00:02:04.720> pieces<00:02:09.030> so<00:02:10.030> you've<00:02:10.119> got<00:02:10.330> a<00:02:10.360> row<00:02:10.569> of<00:02:10.630> nine

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:10.899 
nine pieces so you've got a row of nine

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:13.380 
nine pieces so you've got a row of nine
pieces<00:02:11.349> in<00:02:11.709> eight<00:02:11.950> pieces<00:02:12.220> there<00:02:12.760> nine<00:02:12.970> pieces

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
pieces in eight pieces there nine pieces

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.089 
pieces in eight pieces there nine pieces
now<00:02:14.019> we're<00:02:14.170> going<00:02:14.290> to<00:02:14.349> make<00:02:14.500> the<00:02:14.620> ends<00:02:14.890> of<00:02:14.980> the

00:02:15.089 --> 00:02:15.099 
now we're going to make the ends of the

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:16.350 
now we're going to make the ends of the
Cape<00:02:15.280> so<00:02:15.700> we're<00:02:15.819> going<00:02:15.940> to<00:02:16.000> make<00:02:16.150> these<00:02:16.299> two

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
Cape so we're going to make these two

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.599 
Cape so we're going to make these two
upside-down<00:02:16.989> triangles<00:02:17.620> they're<00:02:18.370> going<00:02:18.519> to

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:18.609 
upside-down triangles they're going to

00:02:18.609 --> 00:02:22.170 
upside-down triangles they're going to
take<00:02:18.760> five<00:02:19.000> pieces<00:02:19.269> and<00:02:20.609> sort<00:02:21.609> them<00:02:21.760> on<00:02:21.970> top<00:02:22.120> of

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
take five pieces and sort them on top of

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.650 
take five pieces and sort them on top of
each<00:02:22.390> other<00:02:22.540> diagonally<00:02:24.269> so<00:02:25.269> you<00:02:25.359> have<00:02:25.510> like

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
each other diagonally so you have like

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:27.930 
each other diagonally so you have like
our<00:02:25.840> diagram<00:02:26.290> staircase<00:02:26.769> of<00:02:27.130> five<00:02:27.519> pieces

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
our diagram staircase of five pieces

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.930 
our diagram staircase of five pieces
then<00:02:28.870> on<00:02:29.019> this<00:02:29.170> bottom<00:02:29.470> piece<00:02:29.650> put<00:02:30.489> on<00:02:30.640> another

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
then on this bottom piece put on another

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:36.720 
then on this bottom piece put on another
piece<00:02:31.209> and<00:02:31.870> build<00:02:32.440> it<00:02:32.530> up<00:02:32.620> diagonally<00:02:35.579> so<00:02:36.579> that

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
piece and build it up diagonally so that

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:38.400 
piece and build it up diagonally so that
one's<00:02:36.910> five<00:02:37.120> pieces<00:02:37.540> and<00:02:37.840> that<00:02:37.959> one's<00:02:38.170> four

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.410 
one's five pieces and that one's four

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:40.890 
one's five pieces and that one's four
pieces<00:02:38.620> then<00:02:39.609> on<00:02:39.760> these<00:02:39.940> two<00:02:40.209> side<00:02:40.480> points

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
pieces then on these two side points

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:42.449 
pieces then on these two side points
you're<00:02:41.350> going<00:02:41.470> to<00:02:41.560> slide<00:02:41.769> this<00:02:41.920> piece<00:02:42.130> over

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:42.459 
you're going to slide this piece over

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:46.140 
you're going to slide this piece over
both<00:02:42.639> of<00:02:42.670> them<00:02:44.190> then<00:02:45.190> you<00:02:45.220> go<00:02:45.430> up<00:02:45.579> diagonally

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
both of them then you go up diagonally

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:49.110 
both of them then you go up diagonally
and<00:02:46.359> put<00:02:46.540> one<00:02:46.690> on<00:02:46.840> top<00:02:47.430> so<00:02:48.430> it<00:02:48.459> goes<00:02:48.639> over<00:02:48.790> these

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
and put one on top so it goes over these

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.080 
and put one on top so it goes over these
two<00:02:49.329> points<00:02:50.220> so<00:02:51.220> just<00:02:51.459> leave<00:02:51.639> this<00:02:51.819> point

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 
two points so just leave this point

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:53.970 
two points so just leave this point
empty<00:02:52.420> you're<00:02:53.049> going<00:02:53.290> to<00:02:53.350> do<00:02:53.410> the<00:02:53.560> same<00:02:53.709> thing

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
empty you're going to do the same thing

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:56.729 
empty you're going to do the same thing
but<00:02:54.220> going<00:02:54.340> the<00:02:54.519> other<00:02:54.579> way<00:02:55.170> so<00:02:56.170> I<00:02:56.230> put<00:02:56.410> on<00:02:56.500> five

00:02:56.729 --> 00:02:56.739 
but going the other way so I put on five

00:02:56.739 --> 00:02:59.430 
but going the other way so I put on five
pieces<00:02:57.010> diagonally<00:02:58.109> going<00:02:59.109> in<00:02:59.260> the<00:02:59.319> other

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 
pieces diagonally going in the other

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.500 
pieces diagonally going in the other
direction<00:02:59.709> put<00:03:00.310> on<00:03:00.430> a<00:03:00.459> piece<00:03:00.700> on<00:03:00.880> top<00:03:01.120> and

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
direction put on a piece on top and

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:05.699 
direction put on a piece on top and
building<00:03:02.079> it<00:03:02.170> up<00:03:02.230> diagonally<00:03:04.380> then<00:03:05.380> a<00:03:05.440> piece

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:05.709 
building it up diagonally then a piece

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:09.000 
building it up diagonally then a piece
on<00:03:05.889> these<00:03:06.100> two<00:03:06.310> points<00:03:07.410> so<00:03:08.410> that<00:03:08.440> it<00:03:08.709> makes<00:03:08.859> a

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010 
on these two points so that it makes a

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:12.599 
on these two points so that it makes a
straight<00:03:09.280> edge<00:03:09.400> then<00:03:10.239> one<00:03:10.420> piece<00:03:10.630> here<00:03:11.609> so

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:12.609 
straight edge then one piece here so

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:14.729 
straight edge then one piece here so
that<00:03:12.790> it<00:03:12.880> lines<00:03:13.060> up<00:03:13.269> with<00:03:13.329> this<00:03:13.569> row<00:03:13.810> so<00:03:14.590> now

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:14.739 
that it lines up with this row so now

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:18.449 
that it lines up with this row so now
you've<00:03:14.859> got<00:03:15.010> the<00:03:15.130> ends<00:03:15.340> of<00:03:15.430> the<00:03:15.549> Cape<00:03:17.459> now

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:18.459 
you've got the ends of the Cape now

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:19.979 
you've got the ends of the Cape now
you're<00:03:18.609> going<00:03:18.730> to<00:03:18.790> take<00:03:18.910> the<00:03:19.060> body<00:03:19.239> go<00:03:19.780> to<00:03:19.840> the
