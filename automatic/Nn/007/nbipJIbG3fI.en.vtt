dozens of speed of Tron heads and packs
around<00:00:44.340> the<00:00:44.579> studio<00:00:44.969> this<00:00:45.780> one<00:00:46.079> right<00:00:46.320> there

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
around the studio this one right there

around the studio this one right there
is<00:00:46.680> the<00:00:46.800> last<00:00:46.980> one<00:00:47.280> I<00:00:47.309> have<00:00:47.610> and<00:00:48.059> I'll<00:00:48.899> probably

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
is the last one I have and I'll probably

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.350 
is the last one I have and I'll probably
hang<00:00:49.289> on<00:00:49.440> to<00:00:49.590> it<00:00:49.739> because<00:00:50.039> it<00:00:50.250> speech<00:00:50.820> on<00:00:51.090> spend

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
hang on to it because it speech on spend

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.889 
hang on to it because it speech on spend
most<00:00:51.539> reliable<00:00:52.379> equipment<00:00:53.100> I<00:00:53.250> have<00:00:53.280> ever<00:00:53.730> used

00:00:53.889 --> 00:00:53.899 
most reliable equipment I have ever used

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:57.080 
most reliable equipment I have ever used
but<00:00:54.899> you<00:00:55.079> know<00:00:55.230> what<00:00:55.469> it's<00:00:56.129> really<00:00:56.850> heavy

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
but you know what it's really heavy

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.560 
but you know what it's really heavy
stuff<00:00:57.379> so<00:00:58.699> along<00:00:59.699> with<00:00:59.730> the<00:00:59.910> para<00:01:00.120> light<00:01:00.329> that

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
stuff so along with the para light that

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:01.760 
stuff so along with the para light that
we're<00:01:00.690> going<00:01:00.780> to<00:01:00.870> use<00:01:01.079> tomorrow<00:01:01.410> which<00:01:01.649> is

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
we're going to use tomorrow which is

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.700 
we're going to use tomorrow which is
kind<00:01:01.980> of<00:01:02.039> overkill<00:01:02.489> for<00:01:02.550> a<00:01:02.760> tabletop<00:01:03.090> machine

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
kind of overkill for a tabletop machine

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.710 
kind of overkill for a tabletop machine
we're<00:01:05.129> going<00:01:05.250> to<00:01:05.309> switch<00:01:05.460> over<00:01:05.729> to<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.540> brown

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
we're going to switch over to the brown

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.300 
we're going to switch over to the brown
color<00:01:06.990> pick<00:01:07.320> ring<00:01:07.890> light<00:01:08.100> and<00:01:09.380> the<00:01:10.380> Topaz<00:01:10.770> a

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
color pick ring light and the Topaz a

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.859 
color pick ring light and the Topaz a
for<00:01:12.119> brown<00:01:13.110> color<00:01:13.409> packs<00:01:14.360> 3,200<00:01:15.360> watts<00:01:15.540> each

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
for brown color packs 3,200 watts each

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.530 
for brown color packs 3,200 watts each
one<00:01:16.200> and<00:01:16.470> a<00:01:16.590> about<00:01:17.340> half<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:18.000> weight<00:01:18.180> of<00:01:18.210> a

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
one and a about half the weight of a

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.670 
one and a about half the weight of a
speed<00:01:18.780> of<00:01:18.900> Tron<00:01:19.080> 2400<00:01:19.860> watt<00:01:20.009> pack<00:01:20.430> so<00:01:21.590> we'll<00:01:22.590> be

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
speed of Tron 2400 watt pack so we'll be

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.300 
speed of Tron 2400 watt pack so we'll be
shooting<00:01:23.040> that<00:01:24.259> machine<00:01:25.259> with<00:01:25.590> this<00:01:25.770> outfit

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
shooting that machine with this outfit

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.660 
shooting that machine with this outfit
which<00:01:26.700> is<00:01:26.939> the<00:01:27.600> para<00:01:27.869> 220<00:01:28.470> and<00:01:28.650> ring<00:01:29.430> light

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
which is the para 220 and ring light

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.810 
which is the para 220 and ring light
assembly<00:01:30.420> and<00:01:30.600> we'll<00:01:31.470> see<00:01:31.650> how<00:01:31.799> it<00:01:32.400> works<00:01:32.610> out

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
assembly and we'll see how it works out

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.260 
assembly and we'll see how it works out
I'd<00:01:33.030> rather<00:01:33.299> that<00:01:33.930> first<00:01:34.350> shoot<00:01:34.619> be<00:01:35.009> with<00:01:35.909> a

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
I'd rather that first shoot be with a

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.710 
I'd rather that first shoot be with a
with<00:01:37.049> a<00:01:37.079> large<00:01:37.380> machine<00:01:37.799> but<00:01:38.360> this<00:01:39.360> is<00:01:39.450> what<00:01:39.600> we

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
with a large machine but this is what we

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.800 
with a large machine but this is what we
have<00:01:39.869> right<00:01:40.140> now<00:01:40.170> and<00:01:40.770> so<00:01:41.430> we'll<00:01:42.420> be<00:01:42.540> heading

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
have right now and so we'll be heading

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.960 
have right now and so we'll be heading
up<00:01:42.960> and<00:01:43.170> see<00:01:43.320> how<00:01:43.470> it<00:01:43.500> see<00:01:44.070> how<00:01:44.189> it<00:01:44.340> goes<00:01:44.520> but

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
up and see how it see how it goes but

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.100 
up and see how it see how it goes but
kind<00:01:45.570> of<00:01:45.659> excited<00:01:46.020> about<00:01:46.229> it<00:01:46.439> and<00:01:47.930> think<00:01:48.930> it's

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
kind of excited about it and think it's

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.749 
kind of excited about it and think it's
going<00:01:49.170> to<00:01:49.320> go<00:01:49.470> pretty<00:01:49.710> pretty<00:01:50.189> easy<00:01:50.430> ever

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
going to go pretty pretty easy ever

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.280 
going to go pretty pretty easy ever
since<00:01:50.970> I've<00:01:51.119> been<00:01:51.149> using<00:01:51.390> the<00:01:51.600> para<00:01:51.810> lights<00:01:52.020> on

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
since I've been using the para lights on

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.590 
since I've been using the para lights on
the<00:01:52.890> industrial<00:01:53.490> shoots<00:01:53.759> the<00:01:53.939> clients<00:01:54.479> have

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
the industrial shoots the clients have

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.330 
the industrial shoots the clients have
just<00:01:54.869> been<00:01:55.049> thrilled<00:01:55.409> because<00:01:55.890> of<00:01:56.009> the<00:01:56.100> ease

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
just been thrilled because of the ease

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.340 
just been thrilled because of the ease
of<00:01:56.810> setup<00:01:57.810> and<00:01:59.299> taking<00:02:00.299> the<00:02:00.390> time<00:02:00.630> down<00:02:00.899> on<00:02:00.960> the

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
of setup and taking the time down on the

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.080 
of setup and taking the time down on the
amount<00:02:01.439> of<00:02:01.619> time<00:02:01.799> I'm<00:02:02.009> back<00:02:02.189> in<00:02:02.460> their

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
amount of time I'm back in their

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.020 
amount of time I'm back in their
facility<00:02:03.750> so<00:02:04.130> this<00:02:05.130> is<00:02:05.189> just<00:02:05.369> a<00:02:05.490> pre<00:02:05.670> shoot

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.930 
facility so this is just a pre shoot
I'll<00:02:06.270> add<00:02:06.600> the<00:02:06.899> video<00:02:07.259> to<00:02:07.550> tomorrow<00:02:08.550> again

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
I'll add the video to tomorrow again

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.790 
I'll add the video to tomorrow again
it's<00:02:09.119> a<00:02:09.179> client<00:02:09.599> that<00:02:09.780> doesn't<00:02:10.470> like<00:02:10.619> me

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
it's a client that doesn't like me
