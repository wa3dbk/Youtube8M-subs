we apply our chamber-music principles to

we apply our chamber-music principles to
rehearsing<00:01:19.700> everything<00:01:20.700> that<00:01:20.850> we<00:01:20.939> do

rehearsing everything that we do

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.419 
rehearsing everything that we do
obviously<00:01:21.360> but<00:01:22.110> the<00:01:22.259> opportunity<00:01:22.979> to<00:01:23.159> do<00:01:23.280> that

00:01:23.419 --> 00:01:23.429 
obviously but the opportunity to do that

00:01:23.429 --> 00:01:26.779 
obviously but the opportunity to do that
with<00:01:23.490> a<00:01:24.030> Beethoven<00:01:24.869> symphony<00:01:24.899> is<00:01:25.469> really<00:01:26.340> very

00:01:26.779 --> 00:01:26.789 
with a Beethoven symphony is really very

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:29.419 
with a Beethoven symphony is really very
rewarding<00:01:27.390> for<00:01:27.569> for<00:01:27.960> all<00:01:28.079> of<00:01:28.229> us<00:01:28.319> I<00:01:28.500> mean<00:01:28.829> we

00:01:29.419 --> 00:01:29.429 
rewarding for for all of us I mean we

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:33.830 
rewarding for for all of us I mean we
have<00:01:30.360> both<00:01:30.719> the<00:01:31.289> orchestral<00:01:32.509> grandeur<00:01:33.509> in

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
have both the orchestral grandeur in

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.880 
have both the orchestral grandeur in
mind<00:01:34.140> but<00:01:34.740> also<00:01:35.159> have<00:01:35.759> the<00:01:36.380> flexibility<00:01:37.380> of<00:01:37.709> us

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
mind but also have the flexibility of us

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.190 
mind but also have the flexibility of us
of<00:01:38.130> a<00:01:38.280> chamber<00:01:38.490> orchestra<00:01:38.819> at<00:01:39.569> the<00:01:39.750> same<00:01:39.929> time

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
of a chamber orchestra at the same time

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.190 
of a chamber orchestra at the same time
that<00:01:40.950> in<00:01:41.250> its<00:01:41.459> biggest<00:01:42.000> moments<00:01:42.569> we<00:01:42.780> can<00:01:42.929> feel

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
that in its biggest moments we can feel

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.889 
that in its biggest moments we can feel
like<00:01:43.229> a<00:01:43.439> big<00:01:43.829> Symphony<00:01:44.670> Orchestra<00:01:45.149> and<00:01:45.329> it<00:01:45.689> at

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
like a big Symphony Orchestra and it at

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.350 
like a big Symphony Orchestra and it at
its<00:01:46.110> most<00:01:46.380> intimate<00:01:46.890> moments<00:01:47.459> we<00:01:47.970> can<00:01:48.119> feel

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
its most intimate moments we can feel

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.850 
its most intimate moments we can feel
like<00:01:48.659> it's<00:01:48.959> more<00:01:49.319> of<00:01:49.349> a<00:01:49.560> chamber<00:01:50.689> ensemble<00:01:51.689> and

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:51.860 
like it's more of a chamber ensemble and

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:56.449 
like it's more of a chamber ensemble and
I<00:01:52.860> think<00:01:53.189> that<00:01:54.060> mix<00:01:54.479> is<00:01:54.750> kind<00:01:54.959> of<00:01:55.020> unique<00:01:55.459> it's

00:01:56.449 --> 00:01:56.459 
I think that mix is kind of unique it's

00:01:56.459 --> 00:01:58.249 
I think that mix is kind of unique it's
interesting<00:01:56.759> that<00:01:57.060> this<00:01:57.209> piece<00:01:57.539> we<00:01:57.810> associate

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
interesting that this piece we associate

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.080 
interesting that this piece we associate
with<00:01:58.289> a<00:01:58.470> certain<00:01:58.860> kind<00:01:59.039> of<00:01:59.099> massive<00:01:59.579> orchestra

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
with a certain kind of massive orchestra

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.319 
with a certain kind of massive orchestra
sound<00:02:00.360> which<00:02:00.659> with<00:02:01.789> 38:39<00:02:02.789> musicians<00:02:03.209> on

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
sound which with 38:39 musicians on

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.419 
sound which with 38:39 musicians on
stage<00:02:03.569> we're<00:02:03.840> not<00:02:03.959> going<00:02:04.079> to<00:02:04.110> be<00:02:04.229> trying<00:02:04.530> to<00:02:04.739> to

00:02:05.419 --> 00:02:05.429 
stage we're not going to be trying to to

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:08.210 
stage we're not going to be trying to to
replicate<00:02:05.969> the<00:02:06.630> energy<00:02:07.110> and<00:02:07.409> and<00:02:07.649> and

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
replicate the energy and and and

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.130 
replicate the energy and and and
certainly<00:02:08.849> the<00:02:09.000> sense<00:02:09.209> of<00:02:09.299> volume<00:02:09.750> is<00:02:10.019> going

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
certainly the sense of volume is going

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.630 
certainly the sense of volume is going
to<00:02:10.229> be<00:02:10.349> there<00:02:10.560> but<00:02:10.709> not<00:02:10.769> this<00:02:11.069> kind<00:02:11.280> of<00:02:11.310> mass

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
to be there but not this kind of mass

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.100 
to be there but not this kind of mass
that<00:02:12.030> would<00:02:12.180> that<00:02:12.269> we<00:02:12.420> associate<00:02:12.900> when<00:02:12.989> we

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
that would that we associate when we

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.879 
that would that we associate when we
hear<00:02:13.440> that<00:02:14.250> opening<00:02:15.090> Figaro<00:02:15.420> ah<00:02:16.200> hear

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:16.889 
hear that opening Figaro ah hear

00:02:16.889 --> 00:02:20.180 
hear that opening Figaro ah hear
something<00:02:17.190> so<00:02:17.430> big<00:02:18.090> and<00:02:18.389> loud<00:02:18.630> and<00:02:19.019> full<00:02:19.470> ours

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
something so big and loud and full ours

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:21.770 
something so big and loud and full ours
is<00:02:20.400> going<00:02:20.549> to<00:02:20.609> be<00:02:20.910> something<00:02:21.389> that's<00:02:21.540> more

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
is going to be something that's more

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.440 
is going to be something that's more
flexible<00:02:22.380> but<00:02:23.220> the<00:02:23.340> advantage<00:02:23.730> is<00:02:23.880> that<00:02:23.910> that

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
flexible but the advantage is that that

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.330 
flexible but the advantage is that that
really<00:02:24.810> inherent<00:02:25.440> in<00:02:25.590> the<00:02:25.709> score<00:02:26.010> is<00:02:26.160> this

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
really inherent in the score is this

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.430 
really inherent in the score is this
really<00:02:27.000> demand<00:02:27.420> for<00:02:27.630> a<00:02:27.660> kind<00:02:27.930> of<00:02:28.049> nimbleness

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
really demand for a kind of nimbleness

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.490 
really demand for a kind of nimbleness
and<00:02:28.709> a<00:02:28.829> reactiveness<00:02:29.670> and<00:02:30.090> to<00:02:30.900> be<00:02:31.019> working<00:02:31.350> on

and a reactiveness and to be working on

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.759 
and a reactiveness and to be working on
it<00:02:31.650> as<00:02:31.739> we<00:02:32.040> are<00:02:32.190> now<00:02:32.489> in<00:02:32.760> the<00:02:33.299> context<00:02:33.810> of<00:02:33.989> our
