00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:55.590 
this big giant gaudy arm move this arm

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:59.240 
this big giant gaudy arm move this arm
out<00:05:55.740> here<00:05:56.070> first<00:05:56.430> and<00:05:56.760> then<00:05:57.020> he<00:05:58.020> just<00:05:58.380> fold

00:05:59.240 --> 00:05:59.250

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:02.760 
this out with the with the the doors and

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:05.840 
this out with the with the the doors and
then<00:06:02.910> you<00:06:03.780> got<00:06:03.990> that<00:06:04.020> tear<00:06:04.560> so<00:06:05.490> he's<00:06:05.610> got<00:06:05.729> this

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:05.850 
then you got that tear so he's got this

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:09.219 
then you got that tear so he's got this
giant<00:06:05.910> massive<00:06:06.870> arm<00:06:07.440> which<00:06:08.250> is<00:06:08.430> kind<00:06:08.729> of<00:06:08.850> I

00:06:09.219 --> 00:06:09.229 
giant massive arm which is kind of I

00:06:09.229 --> 00:06:12.950 
giant massive arm which is kind of I
don't<00:06:10.229> know<00:06:10.350> kind<00:06:10.650> of<00:06:10.740> silly<00:06:11.040> but<00:06:11.370> I<00:06:12.090> would<00:06:12.750> say

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:12.960 
don't know kind of silly but I would say

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:15.730 
don't know kind of silly but I would say
it<00:06:13.110> works<00:06:13.380> but<00:06:13.650> it<00:06:13.850> really<00:06:14.850> doesn't<00:06:15.270> work<00:06:15.300> well

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:15.740 
it works but it really doesn't work well

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:18.409 
it works but it really doesn't work well
I<00:06:16.740> guess<00:06:17.340> they<00:06:17.490> could<00:06:17.669> have<00:06:17.760> taken<00:06:17.940> this<00:06:18.210> and

00:06:18.409 --> 00:06:18.419 
I guess they could have taken this and

00:06:18.419 --> 00:06:20.120 
I guess they could have taken this and
made<00:06:18.990> it<00:06:19.140> somehow<00:06:19.350> where<00:06:19.650> they<00:06:19.770> could<00:06:20.040> have

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:20.130 
made it somehow where they could have

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:20.750 
made it somehow where they could have
flipped
