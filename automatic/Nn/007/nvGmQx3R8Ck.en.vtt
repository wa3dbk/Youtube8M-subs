00:00:02.459 --> 00:00:08.629
 video review how to drink your delicious 

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:11.879
 up stand up sandy he alone 

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:18.660
 everybody really likes now try 

00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:22.140
 make a burman I begin and why with 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.700
 by him the target loves us to eat 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.480
 cool vanilla plug wide 

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:29.340
 a little connection with no less the best in 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:33.290
 particulars specifically designed for 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:35.820
 this spoon for lack of sugar but 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:37.140
 which cane leg can usually 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.239
 rather, someone even likes it more 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.989
 usually rather than reed seems to me 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.989
 put excuses 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:48.510
 Rasskazova case respectively on Sahih 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:53.790
 spoon pouring a thin stream 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:56.239
 absinthe on sugar so that sugar and soaked 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:58.200
 absinthe 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:04.830
 so that he has the opportunity 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:08.250
 ha after all now we set fire to sugar 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:11.940
 necessary for the drink to become 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:16.880
 more sweet aroma because absinthe 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:18.960
 itself has a lot of bitter taste 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.369
 it also happens to be sugar syrup 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.920
 instead of refined 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:25.350
 it harness generally look on the internet a lot 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:30.200
 recipes like Absalom do imbued 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:33.590
 the device, respectively, now we wait while 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.590
 sugar burns 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:44.170
 and syrup caramel hoof cover will be 

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:46.520
 so will be with the owner 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:49.640
 the main wait for the moment 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:51.319
 when the sugar stops practically 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:55.579
 we will not burn out yet 

00:01:51.319 --> 00:02:01.780
 so that you can cube sugar cube 

00:01:55.579 --> 00:02:01.780
 drop on drink this drink caught fire 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:21.709
 here is a handsome fragrance went start spinning 

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:27.910
 There is no twist so that I can not glass and 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:33.799
 drink to heat up why in another bakaya 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:36.620
 plowed igromir convenient just a cold 

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:38.989
 area will stop to lead a little bit 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:43.160
 close the universal thing Russian 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:46.370
 sugar means we did not form 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:50.450
 rarefaction not smacked glasses whom sugar 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:54.260
 already a little was not a fact that may already 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:55.220
 touch sugar can't lust it 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.319
 interesting 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:59.079
 pour another glass so as not to 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:04.849
 burn it first 

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:08.960
 went and secondly to the aroma of absinthe 

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:10.400
 no, I didn't score 

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:15.800
 see let's say it was possible to join 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:17.600

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:32.330
 try that you eat sugar 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:35.150
 we appreciate it very well 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:38.210
 absinthe turned out just the temperature 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:40.580
 in fact let's say bodies and he practically 

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:42.590
 not felt very well turned out and 

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:45.380
 sugar tomorrow maybe maybe a little 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:49.240
 shake more but generally very 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:53.390
 good and tasty but bon appetite 

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:55.820
 Wonderful important thing to find 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:56.980
 next year wormwood again is very hard 

00:03:55.820 --> 00:04:00.580
 on Igor Kupala 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:04.120
