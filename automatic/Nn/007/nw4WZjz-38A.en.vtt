00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
very completely and right here Heinz

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.150 
very completely and right here Heinz
opens<00:00:27.269> to<00:00:27.539> 1.3<00:00:28.349> million<00:00:28.560> which<00:00:28.830> is<00:00:28.949> about<00:00:29.099> a

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
opens to 1.3 million which is about a

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.890 
opens to 1.3 million which is about a
two<00:00:29.460> big<00:00:29.640> blind<00:00:29.820> raised<00:00:30.029> with<00:00:30.359> pocket<00:00:30.750> queens

two big blind raised with pocket queens

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.229 
two big blind raised with pocket queens
and<00:00:31.230> I<00:00:32.009> think<00:00:32.160> this<00:00:32.219> is<00:00:32.279> a<00:00:32.550> perfectly<00:00:33.059> fine

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
and I think this is a perfectly fine

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:34.700 
and I think this is a perfectly fine
play<00:00:33.540> and<00:00:33.660> I<00:00:33.690> don't<00:00:33.840> really<00:00:33.930> think<00:00:34.200> any<00:00:34.530> other

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
play and I don't really think any other

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.590 
play and I don't really think any other
play<00:00:34.980> would<00:00:35.250> make<00:00:35.430> sense<00:00:36.230> lamb<00:00:37.230> calls<00:00:38.600> it

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
play would make sense lamb calls it

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.380 
play would make sense lamb calls it

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
even like 98 suited stuff like that you

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.010 
even like 98 suited stuff like that you
can<00:01:15.060> get<00:01:15.119> them<00:01:15.270> off<00:01:15.360> of<00:01:15.390> all<00:01:15.570> of<00:01:15.659> those<00:01:15.780> if<00:01:15.930> you

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
can get them off of all of those if you

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.810 
can get them off of all of those if you
rip<00:01:16.170> it<00:01:16.200> all<00:01:16.380> in<00:01:16.530> here<00:01:16.710> I<00:01:16.920> do<00:01:17.520> think<00:01:17.790> that

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
rip it all in here I do think that

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.730 
rip it all in here I do think that
shoving<00:01:18.210> is<00:01:18.360> really<00:01:18.630> the<00:01:18.780> only<00:01:19.020> option<00:01:19.200> given

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
shoving is really the only option given

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.249 
shoving is really the only option given
their<00:01:19.920> stack<00:01:20.130> sizes<00:01:20.400> shoving<00:01:20.909> or<00:01:21.060> calling<00:01:21.509> I

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
their stack sizes shoving or calling I

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:23.480 
their stack sizes shoving or calling I
don't<00:01:22.680> really<00:01:22.799> think<00:01:22.890> you<00:01:23.130> should<00:01:23.159> be<00:01:23.310> making

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
don't really think you should be making

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.630 
don't really think you should be making
it<00:01:23.900> you<00:01:24.900> know<00:01:24.990> 800<00:01:25.560> or<00:01:25.799> eight<00:01:26.100> million<00:01:26.490> and

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
it you know 800 or eight million and

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:27.830 
it you know 800 or eight million and
then<00:01:26.729> folding<00:01:27.090> to<00:01:27.180> a<00:01:27.210> shove<00:01:27.479> or<00:01:27.570> anything<00:01:27.810> like

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
then folding to a shove or anything like

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.600 
then folding to a shove or anything like
that<00:01:27.990> or<00:01:28.140> eight<00:01:28.350> million<00:01:28.590> to<00:01:28.799> induce<00:01:29.040> a<00:01:29.159> shop<00:01:29.400> I

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
that or eight million to induce a shop I

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.700 
that or eight million to induce a shop I
think<00:01:30.479> you're<00:01:30.659> probably<00:01:30.840> better<00:01:31.170> off<00:01:31.290> calling

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
think you're probably better off calling

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.230 
think you're probably better off calling
here<00:01:32.100> and<00:01:32.310> taking<00:01:32.670> a<00:01:32.729> flop<00:01:32.970> in<00:01:34.970> general<00:01:35.970> now<00:01:36.150> if

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
here and taking a flop in general now if

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.719 
here and taking a flop in general now if
this<00:01:36.390> was<00:01:36.750> a<00:01:37.259> final<00:01:38.159> table<00:01:38.430> where<00:01:38.520> there<00:01:38.640> was

this was a final table where there was

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.510 
this was a final table where there was
less<00:01:38.970> money<00:01:39.299> at<00:01:39.450> stake<00:01:40.189> like<00:01:41.189> say<00:01:41.369> you're

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
less money at stake like say you're

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:42.710 
less money at stake like say you're

two<00:01:46.770> hundred<00:01:47.009> thousand<00:01:47.250> dollars<00:01:47.310> to<00:01:47.640> their

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
two hundred thousand dollars to their

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.580 
two hundred thousand dollars to their
name<00:01:47.970> I<00:01:48.210> think<00:01:49.020> this<00:01:49.079> would<00:01:49.200> be<00:01:49.229> a<00:01:49.290> pretty<00:01:49.500> easy

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
name I think this would be a pretty easy

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.679 
name I think this would be a pretty easy
shove<00:01:50.040> because<00:01:50.460> in<00:01:50.610> that<00:01:50.729> final<00:01:51.030> table<00:01:51.479> no

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
shove because in that final table no

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.660 
shove because in that final table no
one's<00:01:51.840> really<00:01:51.930> going<00:01:52.020> to<00:01:52.200> care<00:01:52.380> about<00:01:52.710> making

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
one's really going to care about making

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.850 
one's really going to care about making
it<00:01:53.850> deeper<00:01:54.210> but<00:01:54.689> at<00:01:54.810> this<00:01:54.869> final<00:01:55.170> table<00:01:55.500> the

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
it deeper but at this final table the

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.889 
it deeper but at this final table the
bubble<00:01:56.250> fact<00:01:56.549> the<00:01:56.759> bubble<00:01:57.030> factor<00:01:57.570> is<00:01:57.630> so

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
bubble fact the bubble factor is so

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:01.490 
bubble fact the bubble factor is so
strong<00:01:58.350> that<00:01:59.009> I<00:02:00.020> think<00:02:01.020> calling<00:02:01.320> here<00:02:01.439> is

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
strong that I think calling here is

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.160 
strong that I think calling here is
probably<00:02:01.590> going<00:02:01.829> to<00:02:01.890> be<00:02:01.979> the<00:02:02.130> right<00:02:02.219> play<00:02:03.170> so

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
probably going to be the right play so

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.590 
probably going to be the right play so
Heinz<00:02:04.890> does<00:02:05.159> call<00:02:05.399> I<00:02:05.430> like<00:02:05.700> that<00:02:05.880> call<00:02:06.090> and

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
Heinz does call I like that call and

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.240 
Heinz does call I like that call and
you're<00:02:06.750> not<00:02:06.840> so<00:02:06.990> much<00:02:07.110> calling<00:02:07.500> here<00:02:07.770> to<00:02:08.039> get

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
you're not so much calling here to get

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:09.499 
you're not so much calling here to get
away<00:02:08.280> from<00:02:08.459> the<00:02:08.729> hand<00:02:08.970> you<00:02:09.119> have<00:02:09.209> to<00:02:09.300> realize

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
away from the hand you have to realize

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:10.609 
away from the hand you have to realize
you're<00:02:09.690> calling<00:02:09.989> here<00:02:10.140> to<00:02:10.229> try<00:02:10.349> to<00:02:10.410> get<00:02:10.530> your

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
you're calling here to try to get your

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.780 
you're calling here to try to get your
opponent<00:02:11.069> to<00:02:11.099> put<00:02:11.610> a<00:02:11.640> lot<00:02:11.849> of<00:02:11.910> money<00:02:12.000> in

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
opponent to put a lot of money in

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:17.309 
opponent to put a lot of money in
with<00:02:13.209> their<00:02:13.810> air<00:02:15.239> so<00:02:16.239> I<00:02:16.269> do<00:02:16.569> think<00:02:16.750> the<00:02:16.900> call<00:02:17.079> is

00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:17.319 
with their air so I do think the call is

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:20.520 
with their air so I do think the call is
perfectly<00:02:17.709> fun<00:02:17.890> and<00:02:18.870> winnow<00:02:19.870> day<00:02:20.079> three<00:02:20.319> bets

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
perfectly fun and winnow day three bets

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:21.750 
perfectly fun and winnow day three bets
I<00:02:20.680> really<00:02:20.950> don't<00:02:21.099> know<00:02:21.159> anything<00:02:21.430> about<00:02:21.609> 0

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
I really don't know anything about 0

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.369 
I really don't know anything about 0
days<00:02:22.060> game<00:02:22.329> Wharf<00:02:22.569> Heinz<00:02:22.870> this<00:02:23.019> game<00:02:23.170> for<00:02:23.319> that

00:02:23.369 --> 00:02:23.379 
days game Wharf Heinz this game for that

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:24.569 
days game Wharf Heinz this game for that
matter<00:02:23.620> but<00:02:23.709> if<00:02:24.040> this<00:02:24.189> is<00:02:24.250> just<00:02:24.459> like<00:02:24.489> a

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:24.579 
matter but if this is just like a

00:02:24.579 --> 00:02:25.979 
matter but if this is just like a
generic<00:02:25.000> opponent<00:02:25.420> I<00:02:25.450> expect<00:02:25.689> he's<00:02:25.780> going<00:02:25.930> to

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:25.989 
generic opponent I expect he's going to

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:27.809 
generic opponent I expect he's going to
have<00:02:26.079> something<00:02:26.290> like<00:02:26.500> good<00:02:27.069> big<00:02:27.310> cards<00:02:27.700> like

00:02:27.809 --> 00:02:27.819 
have something like good big cards like

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:30.569 
have something like good big cards like
Ace<00:02:28.000> King<00:02:28.239> ace<00:02:28.420> Queen<00:02:28.780> may<00:02:29.709> be<00:02:29.739> baked<00:02:30.280> pears

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:30.579 
Ace King ace Queen may be baked pears

00:02:30.579 --> 00:02:33.509 
Ace King ace Queen may be baked pears
like<00:02:30.909> maybe<00:02:31.239> nines<00:02:31.989> are<00:02:32.200> better<00:02:32.409> and<00:02:32.650> then

00:02:33.509 --> 00:02:33.519 
like maybe nines are better and then

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:35.990 
like maybe nines are better and then
some<00:02:33.730> random<00:02:34.030> hands<00:02:34.269> like<00:02:34.540> pseudo<00:02:34.810> connectors

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
some random hands like pseudo connectors

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.610 
some random hands like pseudo connectors
so<00:02:37.000> we<00:02:37.359> get<00:02:37.450> a<00:02:37.480> pretty<00:02:37.689> pretty<00:02:38.079> good<00:02:38.260> flop<00:02:38.470> for

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
so we get a pretty pretty good flop for

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:44.039 
so we get a pretty pretty good flop for
Heinz<00:02:38.799> and<00:02:40.889> O'Day<00:02:41.889> bets<00:02:42.180> 4.6<00:02:43.180> million<00:02:43.540> I<00:02:43.840> think

00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:44.049 
Heinz and O'Day bets 4.6 million I think

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:47.849 
Heinz and O'Day bets 4.6 million I think
this<00:02:44.109> is<00:02:44.170> a<00:02:44.290> pretty<00:02:44.650> easy<00:02:44.950> call<00:02:45.099> I<00:02:46.859> don't

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:47.859 
this is a pretty easy call I don't

00:02:47.859 --> 00:02:49.379 
this is a pretty easy call I don't
really<00:02:47.950> I<00:02:48.310> don't<00:02:48.430> really<00:02:48.579> think<00:02:48.760> there's<00:02:49.120> any

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:49.389 
really I don't really think there's any

00:02:49.389 --> 00:02:51.690 
really I don't really think there's any
other<00:02:49.480> possibility<00:02:50.319> here<00:02:50.530> if<00:02:50.919> you<00:02:51.099> shove<00:02:51.430> here

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 
other possibility here if you shove here

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:53.039 
other possibility here if you shove here
you're<00:02:51.849> going<00:02:51.939> to<00:02:52.030> get<00:02:52.120> a<00:02:52.180> day<00:02:52.419> off<00:02:52.450> of<00:02:52.720> a<00:02:52.810> lot

00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:53.049 
you're going to get a day off of a lot

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:55.740 
you're going to get a day off of a lot
of<00:02:53.349> air<00:02:53.739> which<00:02:54.370> is<00:02:54.549> really<00:02:54.760> bad<00:02:55.000> and<00:02:55.299> if<00:02:55.480> O'Day

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
of air which is really bad and if O'Day

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:57.509 
of air which is really bad and if O'Day
has<00:02:55.930> us<00:02:56.139> beat<00:02:56.319> he's<00:02:56.560> going<00:02:56.709> to<00:02:56.769> call<00:02:56.950> virtually

00:02:57.509 --> 00:02:57.519 
has us beat he's going to call virtually

00:02:57.519 --> 00:02:59.520 
has us beat he's going to call virtually
every<00:02:57.730> time<00:02:57.909> so<00:02:58.329> I<00:02:58.540> don't<00:02:59.200> really<00:02:59.260> think

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
every time so I don't really think

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:02.460 
every time so I don't really think
shoving<00:02:59.919> here<00:03:00.099> has<00:03:00.280> too<00:03:00.790> much<00:03:00.939> merit<00:03:01.419> you<00:03:02.409> of

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
shoving here has too much merit you of

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:04.229 
shoving here has too much merit you of
course<00:03:02.650> do<00:03:02.919> give<00:03:03.099> up<00:03:03.220> some<00:03:03.459> free<00:03:03.700> cards<00:03:04.060> which

00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:04.239 
course do give up some free cards which

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:06.179 
course do give up some free cards which
may<00:03:04.540> come<00:03:04.750> back<00:03:04.870> to<00:03:04.930> bite<00:03:05.079> you<00:03:05.349> if<00:03:05.560> a<00:03:05.950> club

00:03:06.179 --> 00:03:06.189 
may come back to bite you if a club

00:03:06.189 --> 00:03:10.440 
may come back to bite you if a club
comes<00:03:06.430> on<00:03:06.579> the<00:03:06.669> turn<00:03:08.400> you<00:03:09.400> know<00:03:09.519> it's<00:03:09.790> it's<00:03:10.090> not

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450 
comes on the turn you know it's it's not

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:11.729 
comes on the turn you know it's it's not
really<00:03:10.750> that<00:03:10.930> bad<00:03:11.169> because<00:03:11.500> we<00:03:11.590> have<00:03:11.680> the

00:03:11.729 --> 00:03:11.739 
really that bad because we have the

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:13.080 
really that bad because we have the
queen<00:03:11.889> of<00:03:11.919> clubs<00:03:12.159> which<00:03:12.459> will<00:03:12.669> give<00:03:12.790> you<00:03:12.879> some

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090 
queen of clubs which will give you some

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:14.909 
queen of clubs which will give you some
apps<00:03:13.269> or<00:03:13.540> if<00:03:14.230> your<00:03:14.439> opponent<00:03:14.530> does<00:03:14.769> happen

00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:14.919 
apps or if your opponent does happen

00:03:14.919 --> 00:03:16.170 
apps or if your opponent does happen
have<00:03:15.099> like<00:03:15.220> ace<00:03:15.370> king<00:03:15.639> with<00:03:15.760> the<00:03:15.790> ace<00:03:15.909> of<00:03:16.060> clubs

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.180 
have like ace king with the ace of clubs

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:17.580 
have like ace king with the ace of clubs
it<00:03:16.480> may<00:03:16.569> induce<00:03:16.780> them<00:03:16.959> to<00:03:17.019> get<00:03:17.169> it<00:03:17.290> all<00:03:17.379> in

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590 
it may induce them to get it all in

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:19.379 
it may induce them to get it all in
drawing<00:03:18.430> pretty<00:03:18.699> thin<00:03:18.909> so<00:03:19.120> you<00:03:19.180> don't<00:03:19.329> really

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:19.389 
drawing pretty thin so you don't really

00:03:19.389 --> 00:03:22.800 
drawing pretty thin so you don't really
mind<00:03:19.629> if<00:03:19.750> a<00:03:19.810> club<00:03:20.019> deal's<00:03:20.260> off<00:03:20.819> so<00:03:21.819> what<00:03:22.569> cars

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
mind if a club deal's off so what cars

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:24.539 
mind if a club deal's off so what cars
are<00:03:22.989> bad<00:03:23.229> for<00:03:23.260> us<00:03:23.590> on<00:03:23.829> the<00:03:23.859> turn<00:03:24.129> and<00:03:24.340> the<00:03:24.430> only

00:03:24.539 --> 00:03:24.549 
are bad for us on the turn and the only

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:26.009 
are bad for us on the turn and the only
the<00:03:24.760> only<00:03:24.819> cards<00:03:25.299> that<00:03:25.389> are<00:03:25.479> bad<00:03:25.629> or<00:03:25.659> like<00:03:25.900> an

00:03:26.009 --> 00:03:26.019 
the only cards that are bad or like an

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:28.289 
the only cards that are bad or like an
Ace<00:03:26.139> or<00:03:26.290> King<00:03:26.349> and<00:03:26.940> even<00:03:27.940> then<00:03:28.090> if<00:03:28.209> our

00:03:28.289 --> 00:03:28.299 
Ace or King and even then if our

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:30.420 
Ace or King and even then if our
opponents<00:03:28.599> thing<00:03:28.690> over<00:03:28.840> here<00:03:28.870> Jax<00:03:29.340> it's<00:03:30.340> not

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:30.430 
opponents thing over here Jax it's not

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:31.379 
opponents thing over here Jax it's not
like<00:03:30.549> the<00:03:30.699> end<00:03:30.790> of<00:03:30.849> the<00:03:30.909> world<00:03:31.000> because<00:03:31.150> he's

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:31.389 
like the end of the world because he's

00:03:31.389 --> 00:03:32.849 
like the end of the world because he's
probably<00:03:31.540> gonna<00:03:31.690> give<00:03:31.900> up<00:03:32.049> and<00:03:32.290> just<00:03:32.319> try<00:03:32.829> to

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:32.859 
probably gonna give up and just try to

00:03:32.859 --> 00:03:35.159 
probably gonna give up and just try to
get<00:03:32.979> a<00:03:33.040> showdown<00:03:33.340> at<00:03:33.489> that<00:03:33.609> point<00:03:33.849> so<00:03:33.970> I<00:03:34.359> didn't

00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:35.169 
get a showdown at that point so I didn't

00:03:35.169 --> 00:03:36.210 
get a showdown at that point so I didn't
call<00:03:35.319> here<00:03:35.440> it's<00:03:35.560> pretty<00:03:35.650> good<00:03:35.889> I<00:03:36.040> don't

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:36.220 
call here it's pretty good I don't

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:38.330 
call here it's pretty good I don't
really<00:03:36.400> think<00:03:36.459> there's<00:03:36.579> any<00:03:36.790> other<00:03:36.849> option

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
really think there's any other option

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:41.879 
really think there's any other option
turns<00:03:39.340> of<00:03:39.459> two<00:03:39.579> of<00:03:39.669> clubs<00:03:39.790> so<00:03:40.799> effectively<00:03:41.799> a

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:41.889 
turns of two of clubs so effectively a

00:03:41.889 --> 00:03:45.360 
turns of two of clubs so effectively a
stone<00:03:42.190> blank<00:03:42.519> and<00:03:42.790> O'Day<00:03:43.659> now<00:03:43.900> bets<00:03:44.370> 8.2

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:45.370 
stone blank and O'Day now bets 8.2

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:50.759 
stone blank and O'Day now bets 8.2
million<00:03:46.979> and<00:03:48.930> notice<00:03:49.930> Heinz<00:03:50.109> only<00:03:50.379> has<00:03:50.500> 16

00:03:50.759 --> 00:03:50.769 
million and notice Heinz only has 16

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:53.490 
million and notice Heinz only has 16
million<00:03:51.040> behind<00:03:51.400> so<00:03:51.729> if<00:03:52.030> he<00:03:52.720> raises<00:03:53.169> it's

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:53.500 
million behind so if he raises it's

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:54.869 
million behind so if he raises it's
going<00:03:53.620> to<00:03:53.680> be<00:03:53.769> a<00:03:53.799> min<00:03:53.979> rays<00:03:54.159> on<00:03:54.340> the<00:03:54.370> river<00:03:54.459> so

00:03:54.869 --> 00:03:54.879 
going to be a min rays on the river so

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:56.309 
going to be a min rays on the river so
he's<00:03:55.000> probably<00:03:55.359> gonna<00:03:55.629> get<00:03:55.840> called<00:03:55.989> unless<00:03:56.169> a

00:03:56.309 --> 00:03:56.319 
he's probably gonna get called unless a

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:59.490 
he's probably gonna get called unless a
day<00:03:56.470> has<00:03:56.680> air<00:03:57.989> sort<00:03:58.989> of<00:03:59.049> interesting<00:03:59.379> though

00:03:59.490 --> 00:03:59.500 
day has air sort of interesting though

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.140 
day has air sort of interesting though
notice<00:03:59.769> there<00:04:00.010> was<00:04:00.220> two<00:04:00.459> million<00:04:00.760> in<00:04:00.879> the<00:04:00.939> pot

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:01.150 
notice there was two million in the pot

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:03.390 
notice there was two million in the pot
on<00:04:01.359> the<00:04:01.479> on<00:04:01.810> the<00:04:01.840> tart<00:04:02.470> going<00:04:02.680> to<00:04:02.769> the<00:04:02.889> turn<00:04:03.099> I

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:03.400 
on the on the tart going to the turn I

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.819 
on the on the tart going to the turn I
think<00:04:03.970> that<00:04:04.419> if<00:04:04.629> o<00:04:04.840> day<00:04:05.049> is<00:04:05.290> going<00:04:05.439> to<00:04:05.500> make<00:04:05.650> a

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:05.829 
think that if o day is going to make a

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:08.339 
think that if o day is going to make a
bet<00:04:06.430> here<00:04:06.790> it<00:04:06.970> should<00:04:07.120> probably<00:04:07.689> just<00:04:07.870> be<00:04:08.139> a

00:04:08.339 --> 00:04:08.349 
bet here it should probably just be a

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:11.580 
bet here it should probably just be a
shove<00:04:09.479> unless<00:04:10.479> he<00:04:10.689> assumes<00:04:11.019> Heinz<00:04:11.319> is<00:04:11.470> going

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:11.590 
shove unless he assumes Heinz is going

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:13.289 
shove unless he assumes Heinz is going
to<00:04:11.650> play<00:04:11.829> extraordinarily<00:04:12.370> straightforward

00:04:13.289 --> 00:04:13.299 
to play extraordinarily straightforward

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:15.089 
to play extraordinarily straightforward
like<00:04:13.810> say<00:04:14.109> hi<00:04:14.290> as<00:04:14.349> they<00:04:14.560> decide<00:04:14.769> to<00:04:14.799> float<00:04:15.069> the

00:04:15.089 --> 00:04:15.099 
like say hi as they decide to float the

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:16.890 
like say hi as they decide to float the

flop with ace Jack with ace of clubs and

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:19.319 
flop with ace Jack with ace of clubs and

with the ace of clubs then I really hate

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:26.170 
O'Dea's bad if he isn't ending unfolding

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:27.900 
O'Dea's bad if he isn't ending unfolding
and<00:04:26.320> any<00:04:26.830> time<00:04:26.890> you're<00:04:27.130> making<00:04:27.340> a<00:04:27.400> bet<00:04:27.580> where

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:27.910 
and any time you're making a bet where

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:33.030 
and any time you're making a bet where
there<00:04:28.270> is<00:04:28.420> no<00:04:29.220> intention<00:04:30.220> to<00:04:30.250> fold<00:04:32.040> you

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:33.040 
there is no intention to fold you

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:34.560 
there is no intention to fold you
probably<00:04:33.430> want<00:04:33.730> to<00:04:33.910> be<00:04:34.030> able<00:04:34.090> to<00:04:34.240> make<00:04:34.300> a<00:04:34.360> bet

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:34.570 
probably want to be able to make a bet

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:37.440 
probably want to be able to make a bet
that<00:04:34.600> you<00:04:34.840> can<00:04:35.140> that<00:04:35.920> has<00:04:36.610> a<00:04:36.640> bluff<00:04:36.940> possible<00:04:37.390> I

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:37.450 
that you can that has a bluff possible I

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:38.370 
that you can that has a bluff possible I
guess<00:04:37.570> what<00:04:37.690> I'm<00:04:37.750> trying<00:04:37.840> to<00:04:37.960> say<00:04:38.020> is<00:04:38.110> need<00:04:38.320> to

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:38.380 
guess what I'm trying to say is need to

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:40.290 
guess what I'm trying to say is need to
be<00:04:38.470> balanced<00:04:38.920> and<00:04:39.070> I'm<00:04:39.640> not<00:04:39.790> sure<00:04:39.820> if<00:04:40.000> this<00:04:40.090> bed

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:40.300 
be balanced and I'm not sure if this bed

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:42.540 
be balanced and I'm not sure if this bed
is<00:04:40.390> balanced<00:04:40.840> in<00:04:40.930> the<00:04:41.050> least<00:04:41.230> bed<00:04:41.440> I<00:04:41.650> think

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:42.550 
is balanced in the least bed I think

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:44.370 
is balanced in the least bed I think
it's<00:04:42.670> either<00:04:42.790> a<00:04:42.880> Stone<00:04:43.240> bluff<00:04:43.450> or<00:04:43.780> very<00:04:44.170> good

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:44.380 
it's either a Stone bluff or very good

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:46.410 
it's either a Stone bluff or very good
and<00:04:44.530> like<00:04:44.740> aces<00:04:45.190> or<00:04:45.280> kings<00:04:45.340> or<00:04:45.820> some<00:04:46.300> random

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:46.420 
and like aces or kings or some random

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:49.260 
and like aces or kings or some random
eight<00:04:47.160> so<00:04:48.160> the<00:04:48.250> best<00:04:48.370> pretty<00:04:48.580> polarized<00:04:49.000> right

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:49.270 
eight so the best pretty polarized right

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:51.360 
eight so the best pretty polarized right
and<00:04:49.510> if<00:04:50.080> the<00:04:50.200> bet<00:04:50.380> is<00:04:50.590> generally<00:04:51.100> going<00:04:51.160> to<00:04:51.280> be

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:51.370 
and if the bet is generally going to be

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:53.400 
and if the bet is generally going to be
polarized<00:04:51.850> I<00:04:52.150> think<00:04:52.540> calling<00:04:53.080> here<00:04:53.320> is

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:53.410 
polarized I think calling here is

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:59.400 
polarized I think calling here is
probably<00:04:53.710> best<00:04:53.920> for<00:04:54.010> Heinz<00:04:54.310> even<00:04:54.880> though<00:04:58.410> you

00:04:59.400 --> 00:04:59.410 
probably best for Heinz even though you

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:00.300 
probably best for Heinz even though you
know<00:04:59.500> there's<00:04:59.680> a<00:04:59.740> lot<00:04:59.770> of<00:04:59.890> money<00:04:59.980> in<00:05:00.130> Pawnee

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:00.310 
know there's a lot of money in Pawnee

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:01.620 
know there's a lot of money in Pawnee
doesn't<00:05:00.520> really<00:05:00.640> mind<00:05:00.820> picking<00:05:01.120> it<00:05:01.300> up<00:05:01.420> I

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:01.630 
doesn't really mind picking it up I

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:03.810 
doesn't really mind picking it up I
think<00:05:02.260> calling<00:05:02.560> is<00:05:02.650> probably<00:05:03.100> best<00:05:03.340> here<00:05:03.640> and

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:03.820 
think calling is probably best here and

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:06.480 
think calling is probably best here and
the<00:05:04.630> reason<00:05:04.840> I<00:05:04.900> like<00:05:05.050> a<00:05:05.080> call<00:05:05.410> is<00:05:05.740> because<00:05:06.070> if

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:06.490 
the reason I like a call is because if

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:08.700 
the reason I like a call is because if
O'Day<00:05:06.880> is<00:05:06.910> bluffing<00:05:07.240> he's<00:05:08.020> probably<00:05:08.260> drawing

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:08.710 
O'Day is bluffing he's probably drawing

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:14.970 
O'Day is bluffing he's probably drawing
near<00:05:09.640> dead<00:05:09.910> and<00:05:10.620> if<00:05:11.620> he<00:05:11.740> has<00:05:11.890> you<00:05:12.070> beat<00:05:12.660> you<00:05:13.980> are

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:14.980 
near dead and if he has you beat you are

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:16.020 
near dead and if he has you beat you are
you<00:05:15.040> know<00:05:15.250> you're<00:05:15.370> not<00:05:15.430> folding<00:05:15.790> it<00:05:15.850> doesn't

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:16.030 
you know you're not folding it doesn't

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:17.010 
you know you're not folding it doesn't
really<00:05:16.150> matter<00:05:16.300> you're<00:05:16.540> getting<00:05:16.720> it<00:05:16.780> all<00:05:16.840> in

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:17.020 
really matter you're getting it all in

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:18.840 
really matter you're getting it all in
regardless<00:05:17.320> on<00:05:17.530> the<00:05:17.590> river<00:05:17.740> so<00:05:18.460> I<00:05:18.490> think<00:05:18.760> right

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:18.850 
regardless on the river so I think right

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:20.310 
regardless on the river so I think right
here<00:05:18.910> you<00:05:19.180> need<00:05:19.300> to<00:05:19.330> call<00:05:19.570> to<00:05:19.750> just<00:05:19.930> keep<00:05:20.080> those

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:20.320 
here you need to call to just keep those

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:23.730 
here you need to call to just keep those

ever get your opponent to fold right
here<00:05:30.550> I<00:05:30.580> don't<00:05:30.850> think<00:05:31.000> it's<00:05:31.120> that<00:05:31.180> bad<00:05:31.920> even<00:05:32.920> if

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:33.010 
here I don't think it's that bad even if

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:34.640 
here I don't think it's that bad even if
your<00:05:33.130> opponent<00:05:33.280> has<00:05:33.460> like<00:05:33.820> saez<00:05:34.150> ace<00:05:34.330> Jack

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:39.880 
out here which I don't think would be

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:44.310 
out here which I don't think would be
very<00:05:39.910> good<00:05:40.470> um<00:05:42.660> you<00:05:43.660> don't<00:05:43.750> really<00:05:43.960> mind<00:05:44.140> him

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:44.320

the river for sure if your opponent has

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:55.740 
the river for sure if your opponent has
pocket<00:05:53.920> kings<00:05:54.160> here<00:05:54.550> and<00:05:54.820> he<00:05:55.210> bets<00:05:55.420> the<00:05:55.600> turn

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:55.750 
pocket kings here and he bets the turn

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:58.080 
pocket kings here and he bets the turn
and<00:05:55.900> you<00:05:55.990> call<00:05:56.290> he<00:05:56.680> may<00:05:56.980> check<00:05:57.430> the<00:05:57.640> river<00:05:57.820> in

00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:58.090 
and you call he may check the river in

00:05:58.090 --> 00:05:59.760 
and you call he may check the river in
which<00:05:58.600> case<00:05:58.750> you<00:05:58.870> could<00:05:58.990> check<00:05:59.170> it<00:05:59.320> back<00:05:59.470> if

00:05:59.760 --> 00:05:59.770 
which case you could check it back if

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:01.740 
which case you could check it back if
you<00:06:00.550> do<00:06:00.670> call<00:06:00.850> the<00:06:00.910> turn<00:06:01.180> and<00:06:01.360> your<00:06:01.480> bonus

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:01.750 
you do call the turn and your bonus

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:03.210 
you do call the turn and your bonus
checks<00:06:02.020> wherever<00:06:02.290> you<00:06:02.380> need<00:06:02.410> to<00:06:02.560> check<00:06:02.710> back<00:06:02.950> I

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:03.220 
checks wherever you need to check back I

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:05.490 
checks wherever you need to check back I
think<00:06:03.850> that's<00:06:04.150> a<00:06:04.210> pretty<00:06:04.360> pretty<00:06:05.170> common

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:05.500 
think that's a pretty pretty common

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:06.840 
think that's a pretty pretty common

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:06.850 
sense that eight million chips you save

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:09.720 
sense that eight million chips you save
behind<00:06:07.180> is<00:06:07.420> worth<00:06:07.660> a<00:06:07.870> ton<00:06:08.080> of<00:06:08.140> equity<00:06:08.590> I<00:06:08.770> mean

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:09.730 
behind is worth a ton of equity I mean

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:10.950 
behind is worth a ton of equity I mean
look<00:06:09.820> there's<00:06:10.030> this<00:06:10.240> holding<00:06:10.570> guy<00:06:10.690> here<00:06:10.930> that

has<00:06:11.200> only<00:06:11.410> nine<00:06:11.740> million<00:06:12.010> so<00:06:12.190> it's<00:06:12.310> not<00:06:12.400> like

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:12.580 
has only nine million so it's not like

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:15.660
