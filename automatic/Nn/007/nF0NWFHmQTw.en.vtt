 Welcome to the new video 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:28.360
 this time i'll show you how to get fast 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:29.380
 a very tasty zucchini soup 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:32.760
 cooked 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:32.760
 the ingredients 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.440
 First wash the zucchinis thoroughly 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.579
 then the onion and the two 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:05.930
 roughly chopping garlic cloves 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:08.659
 or dice the zucchinis 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:10.580
 with skin once along and then roughly in 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:13.090
 cut half thaler and then to 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:13.090
 lay side 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.470
 I melt the butter in one 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:41.990
 medium-sized top and thinnest in the 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.990
 onions and garlic cloves briefly 

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:46.500
 then through the zucchini lower Rhine 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.490
 and they leave approximately ten minutes on 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.490
 lightly simmer 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:03.460
 after the ten minutes of crumbly 2b jong 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.530
 dice it all around with water 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:09.840
 then all about 5 minutes 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:09.840
 simmer and then puree 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:48.290
 But please do not cook any more 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.450
 At the end I add the melted cheese 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:52.900
 you can also take herbal cheese 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:52.900
 she wanted 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.170
 and now it's time to complain 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:12.210
 I have great soup dishes from bread dough 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:14.310
 if you want to know how 

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:16.080
 you just click the power then often 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:18.510

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:19.560
