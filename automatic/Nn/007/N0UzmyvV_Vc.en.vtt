00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.019
 Do you really think your English is the only way to become a herb? 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:11.620
 Atta that subject is like a grass hunger 

00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:15.160
 In the countryside, when weighed by common weeds , 

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:19.060
 This is always an animal. 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:23.740
 Tell me you've recently been approved for high blood pressure. 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:26.980
 I used to have to do this before, and I had a hard time . 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:30.099
 I'm very relaxed. 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:35.559
 But he 's a drug. 

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:39.070
 Very true of the Stray job in our country lives and 2 1g ago 

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:43.719
 Could these creatures really be caused? 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:47.590
 Called the puppy Called the puppy tail like 9 go crazy 

00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:51.820
 Also called Gwangmyeongjo because it is good for the door 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:54.070
 Because starch is contained and sweetness is tested, 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:59.289
 Whether it's recovery or edema 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:01:01.960
 But to take advantage of Article 13 as a first look at the vines that nature is Donguibogam 

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:07.960
 While you gotta cool and not poisonous 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:10.649
 Especially edema, such as inflammation or devastating diarrhea and so on 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.649
 We are applying 

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:21.730
 Hit the job as soon as the vector enters home shine without Kim, Sang Soo 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:24.510
 It's a quick ride to get rid of the water in a car 

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:24.510
 It's important. 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:35.850
 Washing too long, another kid from my 2 cross section 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:41.030
 I have just come out recruiting, so I want to look at the birds are 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:41.030
 The water is also colored by Paul, so it should be possible. 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:45.380
 01 It's a water feature. 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:45.380
 It's a shame. 

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:53.870
 Yes, you should cut your feet when the bites remain, 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:57.620
 Star 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:02:02.210
 Oh, it 's too small to cut, but it's where they end up. 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:07.190
 I do not know. 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:12.110
 Since it decided to fine the taste and nutrition of sugar she must immediately 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:16.190
 After a long trial and error, he says he has found the optimal farm ratio. 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:20.660
 Real Tight 80 80+ Teen 8 Checks 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:24.800
 And the material and the communication It is better to mix it than to not stack up 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:31.160
 Well, it's good, and sugar says it's easy to control the amount. 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:34.610
 When one of them can not put it anymore, the sugar comes in half a poo. 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:40.760
 Although the lead 15 either 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:44.180
 Russia deuleogajyo than 20 km more than I think not going to sugar 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:49.989
 Are we really eating just the sugar ? 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:49.989
 To verify decided to measure the sugar content to the right depending on the aging period 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:03:00.079
 Heat-generated fermentation to see the gnome 62.4 Brix 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:03.280
 If you are six months older than you are, then you will have 50.9 Brix Lock 12.4 

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:03.280
 Briggs lowered each 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:08.630
 If the click takes effect one year later 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:15.749
 43.4 Breeze 7.4 Briggs lowered 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:24.819
 As a result of the experiment , the progress of Ayu decreased and the fermentation process 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:28.810
 What is the reason that the hardness is lowered while passing ? 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:31.150
 The reason the room is falling melted organic acids using microorganisms feed on the sugar and of 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:36.400
 It's made from different materials. 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:37.030
 As such a unit is to be disappears each step converted to the third new material 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:41.049
 That's it. 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:46.379
 I'd say this now because this bioconversion bioconversion of bio b 

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:46.379
 The sugar disappears and new substances are created. 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:57.099
 In the meantime, the four daughters of the fermented liquid is said to have hundreds of Kim Sung Sook c 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:59.819
 Because anger requires time and attention, it is not worth every single jar. 

00:03:57.099 --> 00:03:59.819
 I do not have it. 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:09.640
 He came when he was dead. 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:14.980
 Ah 4 2 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:18.700
 In many cases the fermentation broth is said to be particularly effective in arthritis and gastrointestinal tract 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:25.360
 John Wild Things yiraguyo dolkong 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:29.220
 This is the fourth prize in the wild. 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:29.220
 It 's mid-9th and canned. 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:37.330
 And Joe Basens is excellent in hemostatic action. 

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:43.530
 People who have frequent nosebleeds say they like it. 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:43.530
 The reason why she started adding the fermented milk to the weeds is nice. 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:54.309
 This time I was in fact the hospital has a bad heart was nice not get heart 

00:04:49.839 --> 00:04:59.949
 I have to be here but instead of this I came to this mountain. 

00:04:54.309 --> 00:05:01.209
 Kim Sung-soo suffered from hyperlipemia and angina until five years ago. 

00:04:59.949 --> 00:05:04.779
 Hard 

00:05:01.209 --> 00:05:09.759
 I could breathe and walk. 

00:05:04.779 --> 00:05:13.149
 When I went to the hospital recently, I was surprised again when it was much lowered . 

00:05:09.759 --> 00:05:19.829
 Who happened byeolnam 

00:05:13.149 --> 00:05:19.829
 There is another secret besides her contact with her footsteps 

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:27.960
 The sugar itself is a bit of a flies, you are Kim Sung Wet and half the pot lid 

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:27.960
 To keep it open 

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:34.099
 So enamored bar started showing where they are slowly flocking 5 

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:40.419
 U 

00:05:34.099 --> 00:05:40.419
 The sweets are in a jar of sugar taken Bee slower hadang 

00:05:40.859 --> 00:05:48.870
 Now enters the tail just coming 

00:05:43.589 --> 00:05:55.220
 I want this now 

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:55.220
 Why are you living bees in the fermentation liquid of her and Sanya ? 

00:05:55.460 --> 00:06:02.060
 I have used the saliva the death of the infringement 

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:07.170
 There I said it dissolves songs about ingredients 

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:11.730
 Yeah, that'll live with more captured 

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:18.710
 This is about the punishment Paris they have matured for a year . 

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:18.710
 If so, is it better to have Earl in comparison with ordinary Sanchoslo Paris ? 

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:26.860
 5000 feet to the door of a general mountaineer feet tightly clipped feet app comparison 

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:31.140
 Ranbo 

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:31.140
 How did the result come out? 

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:40.810
 It's a lot of gear . 

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:43.510
 I much rather sanyacho lot so just look hard and rough out near Starter 

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:48.220
 It looks perfect . 

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:51.430
 Even at a glance, more profitable germs appear in the side of Burberry. 

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:55.930
 There was a variety of lactic acid bacteria in the bee-free environment . 

00:06:51.430 --> 00:07:00.100
 It was confirmed that the number of lactic acid bacteria was also significantly higher 

00:06:55.930 --> 00:07:04.210
 Bundles can basically have a lactic acid in the body 

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:09.310
 In other words, I can expect the effect of lactic acid bacteria with bees. 

00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:15.190
 Hey, there are lactic acid bacteria can multiply the seed be in a suit 

00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:20.800
 When I thought that lactic acid bacteria are put into the suit because the suit seed 

00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:23.520
 The dwaeseo be assumed that the complex variety of lactic acid bacteria that are much culture 

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:23.520
 I think I can.
