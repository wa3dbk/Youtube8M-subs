our<00:03:21.870> hand<00:03:22.140> when<00:03:22.290> it<00:03:22.320> comes<00:03:22.560> to<00:03:22.800> what<00:03:23.520> he<00:03:23.640> was<00:03:23.760> it

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:23.850 
our hand when it comes to what he was it

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:25.520 
our hand when it comes to what he was it
was<00:03:23.940> just<00:03:24.090> it<00:03:24.240> was<00:03:24.300> a<00:03:24.390> treat<00:03:24.810> that's<00:03:25.110> right<00:03:25.380> it

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
was just it was a treat that's right it

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:28.670 
was just it was a treat that's right it
was<00:03:25.560> like<00:03:25.740> liver<00:03:26.040> snaps<00:03:26.400> and<00:03:27.300> and<00:03:27.960> secondly<00:03:28.410> I

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
was like liver snaps and and secondly I

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.440 
was like liver snaps and and secondly I
think<00:03:28.920> that<00:03:29.370> the<00:03:29.520> White<00:03:29.880> House<00:03:30.060> I<00:03:30.210> mean<00:03:30.330> right

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
think that the White House I mean right

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:32.180 
think that the White House I mean right
there<00:03:30.600> the<00:03:30.780> president<00:03:31.200> pointed<00:03:31.320> out<00:03:31.650> that<00:03:31.950> he

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
there the president pointed out that he

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.820 
there the president pointed out that he
had<00:03:32.310> eaten<00:03:32.460> dog<00:03:32.820> and<00:03:33.560> grasshoppers<00:03:34.560> and

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:34.830 
had eaten dog and grasshoppers and

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:37.550 
had eaten dog and grasshoppers and
snakes<00:03:35.670> and<00:03:35.970> I<00:03:36.450> think<00:03:36.660> the<00:03:36.750> White<00:03:36.930> House<00:03:37.140> may

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
snakes and I think the White House may

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.810 
snakes and I think the White House may
want<00:03:37.830> to<00:03:37.980> just<00:03:38.160> put<00:03:38.310> out<00:03:38.490> a<00:03:38.520> blanket<00:03:39.240> list<00:03:40.230> of

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:40.820 
want to just put out a blanket list of

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:44.150 
want to just put out a blanket list of
taxonomic<00:03:41.930> phyla<00:03:42.930> from<00:03:43.290> which<00:03:43.470> the<00:03:43.620> president

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:44.160 
taxonomic phyla from which the president

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.250 
taxonomic phyla from which the president
has<00:03:44.340> not<00:03:44.640> eaten<00:03:44.820> I<00:03:45.180> think<00:03:45.600> that<00:03:45.750> would<00:03:45.840> help<00:03:45.990> to

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
has not eaten I think that would help to

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:47.630 
has not eaten I think that would help to
you<00:03:46.500> know<00:03:46.620> because<00:03:47.010> you've<00:03:47.190> got<00:03:47.340> to<00:03:47.460> start

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:47.640 
you know because you've got to start

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:50.350
