00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:08.410
 Hello this time cutting way in the fact that the guitar course for beginners 

00:00:06.819 --> 00:00:12.970
 Explain in detail 

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:18.640
 I think I want to do before cutting though 

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:22.499
 I would like to learn a little bit of the technique called Brassy 6 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.499
 In short it is is because brushing 

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:27.789
 a 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.410
 Overwintering like this cause 

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:31.100
 The four 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:31.950
 With your finger 

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:33.930
 Brush 

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:38.070
 About downstream control 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:43.260
 I'm not holding down well or holding down the port 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:49.180
 I hear something like this when I stroke 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:51.750
 Taking a this but I say the elderly and Burasshin in stroke 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:57.770
 Occasionally Ebras team Mahi 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:57.770
 I'd have Tsu cutting of entering be like this 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.720
 First of all please try the practice of black Shin 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:10.710
 In the case of Edo kid 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.710
 At the bar while excellent 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:18.870
 Though it's eight strokes and contains the so much force 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:40.790
 8 What kind of person 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:42.000
 Bran like a darn beautiful Oh Satie uh uhh uhh uhh please Ah early pop-chan 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:42.740
 Consisting of taking a say 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.960
 Right 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:51.360
 This may not be really is say people who'm perfect a building Well I 1 of the country 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:54.790
 Stroking Kedomo I think that the Meiji is made 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:02:00.300
 Please try to become Well it could be 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:02:00.300
 In Well, but is actually a distinguished service doing cutting 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:10.560
 tan tan 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.560
 2 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:18.830
 During the out stroke 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:22.010
 It's kind of like a jazzy 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:26.150
 But it's hard to say in Ja' Well words 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:29.630
 Well and brushing in the stroke has entered 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:35.069
 Combination of brushing and stroke ordinary stroke 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:41.280
 Even though I think the canard that has been heard of Tteyuu cure 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:42.780
 8 Well was done slowly doing will get wet Well Well is now high of gg 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:47.660
 code 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:47.660
 It is a form of f with 8 Mr. Fred eyes in the valley 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:56.410
 Let's practice with this 8 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:58.140
 Although I draw at first 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:00.069
 That 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:15.870
 1234 of 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:15.870
 The city usually plays woo 

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:41.690
 Boo 1234 eh Neima Speed ​​Wow each one 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:43.090
 In more late the people hard more slowly conducted May I'm Netto like this because 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:46.510
 Hmmm 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:51.200
 Red 234 said that brushing 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:52.230
 8 This is how the finger on the prognosis looks like this 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:56.159
 after 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:58.350
 It is the case of the Well now g Kedomo had stopped sound 

00:03:56.159 --> 00:04:08.900
 Because it is a valley code 

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:08.900
 It does a story you are disconnecting this Um force only draw a 234 disconnect the left forces in the form of the finger 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:20.200
 8 and I'll make these in 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:23.950
 Well So was Tsu only Well then over the Tsu only 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:27.330
 Well I think that I think we can have this rhythm 

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:34.159
 8 I will do it already 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:34.159
 You just need to incorporate it into the stroke. 

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:43.500
 It is like this 

00:04:53.249 --> 00:05:03.029
 In such a way, Eto is now as one pattern now 

00:04:59.219 --> 00:05:08.969
 Because I think that there are various variations of strokes 

00:05:03.029 --> 00:05:14.650
 Well, how is it like this, so how about it 

00:05:08.969 --> 00:05:16.810
 I think why you are smart as you put in your favorite timing 

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:20.770
 8 o'clock f 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:24.730
 If Umekodon is continuous 

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:31.870
 I think it's easy to cut too Mari 

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:33.000
 8 Well now Well you first that the first to have overcome the Valley code Aid to the next 

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:36.830
 Brushing 

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.230
 What can be done successfully 8 

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:39.969
 Had 

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:45.539
 It says that Kana cutting of Nantsu is 

00:05:39.969 --> 00:05:45.539
 Well in the drums and treats like ghost notes 

00:05:45.729 --> 00:05:49.240
 Oh dear 

00:05:47.139 --> 00:05:55.480
 somehow 

00:05:49.240 --> 00:06:02.860
 Say hey this Kedomo've got to Kana strike lock of Nantsu 

00:05:55.480 --> 00:06:03.460
 I think that it will feel like it is a little cool while putting a different sound, so by all means 

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:09.910
 this 

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:11.740
 I remember the word “cutting” and the width of the stoke such as a belt comes out 

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:15.470
 I think it is not 

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:18.040
 Kon'nan'nu from now please try to do the 

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:18.040
 Ah ah ah ah
