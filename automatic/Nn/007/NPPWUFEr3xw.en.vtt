00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
England and then just gotta I should say

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.190 
England and then just gotta I should say
it<00:01:32.820> a<00:01:33.060> walkover<00:01:33.689> draw<00:01:34.079> in<00:01:34.790> Germany<00:01:36.200> allowing

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
it a walkover draw in Germany allowing

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.840 
it a walkover draw in Germany allowing
Arsenal<00:01:37.740> to<00:01:38.579> make<00:01:39.119> Q<00:01:39.570> efforts<00:01:40.020> on<00:01:40.200> target<00:01:40.850> and

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
Arsenal to make Q efforts on target and

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.830 
Arsenal to make Q efforts on target and
I<00:01:42.509> think<00:01:42.990> that<00:01:43.229> there<00:01:43.890> will<00:01:44.070> be<00:01:44.130> no<00:01:44.280> no<00:01:45.119> no

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
I think that there will be no no no

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.929 
I think that there will be no no no
exhaustion<00:01:46.770> no<00:01:47.369> no<00:01:47.880> pressure<00:01:48.479> no<00:01:48.960> tiredness

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:49.939 
exhaustion no no pressure no tiredness

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:53.210 
exhaustion no no pressure no tiredness
