00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.009
 Hello everyone in this issue I will talk about 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:06.690
 free absolutely safe way 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.250
 block with one click on one 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.260
 your android smartphone icon 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.730
 everything is actually very simple but there is 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.590
 nuance and so listen very 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.089
 carefully because with such help 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.130
 if you download this program not from 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.560
 play market from where there is still an opportunity 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.300
 pick up a specific virus on your 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.220
 android device so be very 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.570
 attentive and so what is this 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.660
 This program is called this 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:30.150
 the program is called she drink Bessie block 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.710
 Look, here it is, and the menu 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.770
 looks like this hey bi 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.809
 ok here it download and i need 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.670
 I strongly recommend downloading and from 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.590
 play market do not need to download from coffee 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.540
 from the internet because the program 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.010
 gets admin rights and this 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.750
 very serious thing is like 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.820
 as if given out the keys to the apartment 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.829
 to a complete stranger or from 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.260
 machine or safe all the same 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.180
 therefore swing with a link to play the Market 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.399
 play market of course i place under 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.350
 this video and the program itself looks 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.719
 here it is downloaded so perfectly 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.780
 free well at least this review 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.939
 filmed in mid-February 2015 and 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.860
 she has no advertising ie she has 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:10.650
 I should have no more days 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.990
 notifications not some shit anything she 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.360
 android device did not bring as she 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.340
 it works when we downloaded it 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.110
 we respectively and and open all 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.400
 it's very simple I have everything set up 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.290
 notes first setting 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.780
 you need to allow her rights 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.540
 admin click on the check mark like this 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.430
 looks like when we go into settings i 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.619
 i 'm on construction sites learn from me and and 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.579
 so for such settings, of course, 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.100
 you may be completely different 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:36.869
 depending on the manufacturer android us 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.520
 need to go in safety and in 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.710
 security we need to go in 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.020
 I have device administrators 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.880
 tick control device android 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.920
 this is normal and it should be 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.290
 another question appeared here 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.479
 This is ABC Varnish and I gave 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.490
 she put a tick gave rights 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.479
 Administrator This program allows 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.450
 lock screen 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:02:00.079
 just like that on android devices 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.670
 viruses do not know everything or not but 

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:05.159
 faith in that case may hurt you 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.840
 somehow if you give him 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:08.970
 admin right so i'm so 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.420
 I categorically say do not swing anywhere 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.400
 general files 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:14.950
 swing in trusted sources or in 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:17.440
 play market program settings 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.239
 very simple and just what we need 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.670
 when we enter it click on 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:22.750
 create a label we can immediately select 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:24.430
 different labels 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:26.590
 Now they know about available programs well, 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.660
 a fly you can put all the gears already 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:30.700
 created there was such a fly when 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:32.920
 click on which we lock the screen 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:35.140
 all for what it needs i think to explain 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.819
 not necessary but especially I think it will help 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:38.530
 many owners learn and 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:40.870
 but just learn and smartphones from 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:43.300
 which button is up above which is real 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:46.269
 uncomfortable stretching from me then a button on the side 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:48.819
 but still know the manufacturer did 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:50.290
 unlocking with double tap or tap 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:52.180
 from bottom to top on lock not 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:54.880
 provided so that applets I 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:56.260
 taking advantage of me and it is very convenient also 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:58.540
 I recommend in general and 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:01.930
 and you and be careful again 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:04.780
 because it is a serious virus viruses 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:08.080
 and the so-called viruses they precisely their 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:09.970
 the goal is to get exactly here so he 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:11.980
 was admin imagine 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:13.840
 Iâ€™ll give you another example 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:15.820
 apartment keys that 's all 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:18.160
 be careful swing only with 

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:20.040
 trusted sources in this case 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:23.350
 Of course, download only from the playlist 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:25.930
 but all the next review I promised on my 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:26.859
 shell for htc called go 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:28.799
 launcher 

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:30.700
 believe me i know all launcher.exe 

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:33.310
 tested at least known 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:36.040
 apex launcher there are many lounge voda 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:37.720
 there are many different options but this one 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:39.790
 I like most of all 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:43.239
 due to the fact that there is a huge amount 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:45.459
 settings and stopped advertising to bother 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:47.380
 because I used to use it 

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:49.570
 constantly some muck wielded 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:51.549
 something offered to download something there 

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:53.859
 buy and so on i just have it 

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:56.079
 deleted and now peacefully passed almost a year 

00:03:53.859 --> 00:03:58.720
 if not more climbed looked all 

00:03:56.079 --> 00:04:01.060
 working set nothing gets me 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:02.890
 do not ask to buy some of their own themes 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:05.380
 so I use it honestly 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:07.389
 very pleased okay as always wish 

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:08.950
 be healthy successfully be positive 

00:04:07.389 --> 00:04:13.350
 up to new releases with respect to all 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:13.350
