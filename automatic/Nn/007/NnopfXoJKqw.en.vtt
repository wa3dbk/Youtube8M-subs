another combat arms video now this isn't

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.500 
another combat arms video now this isn't
the<00:00:07.649> traditional<00:00:07.859> video<00:00:08.370> that<00:00:08.670> I<00:00:08.700> normally<00:00:09.330> do

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
the traditional video that I normally do

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.169 
the traditional video that I normally do
kind<00:00:09.960> of<00:00:10.019> like<00:00:10.200> I<00:00:10.500> like<00:00:11.099> to<00:00:11.130> do<00:00:11.370> series<00:00:11.790> I<00:00:11.940> guess

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
kind of like I like to do series I guess

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:14.089 
kind of like I like to do series I guess
because<00:00:12.450> they're<00:00:12.599> just<00:00:12.809> easier<00:00:13.349> to<00:00:13.410> film<00:00:13.830> and

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
because they're just easier to film and

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.160 
because they're just easier to film and
record<00:00:14.460> and<00:00:14.759> the<00:00:15.120> subject<00:00:15.599> has<00:00:15.750> already<00:00:16.049> been

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
more sense to you so basically I took

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.760 
more sense to you so basically I took
two<00:00:52.860> guns<00:00:53.160> what<00:00:53.940> my<00:00:54.210> opinion<00:00:55.199> what<00:00:55.440> in<00:00:55.590> my

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
two guns what my opinion what in my

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.189 
two guns what my opinion what in my
opinion<00:00:56.219> I<00:00:56.309> think<00:00:56.610> are<00:00:56.789> the<00:00:57.420> best<00:00:57.629> guns<00:00:57.930> in<00:00:58.109> the

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
opinion I think are the best guns in the

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.099 
opinion I think are the best guns in the
game<00:00:58.430> currently<00:00:59.430> and<00:01:00.000> the<00:01:00.510> easiest<00:01:00.870> to<00:01:01.079> use

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
game currently and the easiest to use

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.630 
game currently and the easiest to use
and<00:01:01.620> the<00:01:02.370> most<00:01:02.520> versatile<00:01:03.500> so<00:01:04.500> for<00:01:05.430> pretty

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
and the most versatile so for pretty

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.880 
and the most versatile so for pretty
much<00:01:05.729> any<00:01:06.150> map<00:01:06.510> except<00:01:06.990> for<00:01:07.170> a<00:01:07.200> super<00:01:07.650> close

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
much any map except for a super close

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.830 
much any map except for a super close
range<00:01:08.220> map<00:01:08.460> like<00:01:08.729> death-room<00:01:09.240> or<00:01:09.390> junk<00:01:09.600> flee

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
range map like death-room or junk flee

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.440 
range map like death-room or junk flee
the<00:01:10.500> best<00:01:10.740> to<00:01:11.130> weapons<00:01:11.610> set<00:01:11.820> up<00:01:11.939> would<00:01:12.299> be<00:01:12.330> to

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
the best to weapons set up would be to

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.490 
the best to weapons set up would be to
m4a1<00:01:13.430> preferably<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:14.640> m4a1<00:01:15.270> cg<00:01:15.630> BR<00:01:15.930> and<00:01:16.170> then

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
m4a1 preferably the m4a1 cg BR and then

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:22.910 
m4a1 preferably the m4a1 cg BR and then
the<00:01:16.650> g36<00:01:17.340> be<00:01:17.580> a<00:01:17.939> g36<00:01:18.479> ble<00:01:19.229> the<00:01:20.150> g36k<00:01:21.150> II<00:01:21.740> but<00:01:22.740> not

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
the g36 be a g36 ble the g36k II but not

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.390 
the g36 be a g36 ble the g36k II but not
the<00:01:23.100> g36c<00:01:23.820> so<00:01:24.479> pretty<00:01:24.930> much<00:01:25.110> these<00:01:25.770> two<00:01:26.100> guns

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
the g36c so pretty much these two guns

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.730 
the g36c so pretty much these two guns
will<00:01:26.850> set<00:01:27.090> you<00:01:27.240> up<00:01:27.299> for<00:01:27.420> any<00:01:27.810> situation

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
will set you up for any situation

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.340 
will set you up for any situation
on<00:01:28.890> almost<00:01:29.700> all<00:01:30.000> Maps<00:01:30.270> maybe<00:01:30.930> not<00:01:31.200> an

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
on almost all Maps maybe not an

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.200 
on almost all Maps maybe not an
extremely<00:01:31.860> large<00:01:32.159> map<00:01:32.490> like<00:01:32.729> snow<00:01:32.970> valley

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
extremely large map like snow valley

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.330 
extremely large map like snow valley
when<00:01:33.780> you're<00:01:33.900> trying<00:01:34.170> to<00:01:34.290> shoot<00:01:34.860> all<00:01:35.130> the<00:01:35.280> way

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
when you're trying to shoot all the way

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.340 
when you're trying to shoot all the way
across<00:01:35.579> the<00:01:35.729> map<00:01:35.850> maybe<00:01:36.150> the<00:01:36.360> g36<00:01:36.990> won't<00:01:37.200> work

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
across the map maybe the g36 won't work

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.620 
across the map maybe the g36 won't work
done<00:01:37.590> but<00:01:38.220> the<00:01:38.310> reason<00:01:38.610> why<00:01:38.700> this<00:01:38.909> combination

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
done but the reason why this combination

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.990 
done but the reason why this combination
is<00:01:39.750> so<00:01:39.930> successful<00:01:40.229> is<00:01:41.130> because<00:01:41.400> you<00:01:41.759> have<00:01:41.880> the

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
is so successful is because you have the

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.130 
is so successful is because you have the
m4a1<00:01:42.630> cqbr<00:01:43.290> or<00:01:43.680> the<00:01:43.799> m4a1<00:01:44.399> which<00:01:44.820> is<00:01:44.939> very<00:01:45.450> very

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
m4a1 cqbr or the m4a1 which is very very

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.499 
m4a1 cqbr or the m4a1 which is very very
good<00:01:46.439> for<00:01:46.500> close-range<00:01:47.130> and<00:01:47.640> medium-range

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
good for close-range and medium-range

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.560 
good for close-range and medium-range
spray<00:01:49.259> and<00:01:49.619> tap<00:01:50.009> fire<00:01:50.280> it<00:01:50.909> has<00:01:51.060> very<00:01:51.329> low

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
spray and tap fire it has very low

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:52.790 
spray and tap fire it has very low
recoil<00:01:51.780> and<00:01:52.200> it<00:01:52.290> does<00:01:52.439> see

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:52.800 
recoil and it does see

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.280 
recoil and it does see
vacant<00:01:53.190> amounts<00:01:53.520> of<00:01:53.610> damage<00:01:54.030> and<00:01:54.300> then<00:01:55.170> you

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
vacant amounts of damage and then you

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.640 
vacant amounts of damage and then you
have<00:01:55.440> your<00:01:55.560> g36<00:01:56.370> e<00:01:56.580> orgy<00:01:57.570> 36<00:01:58.080> to<00:01:58.230> back<00:01:58.410> you<00:01:58.620> up

00:01:58.640 --> 00:01:58.650 
have your g36 e orgy 36 to back you up

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:00.950 
have your g36 e orgy 36 to back you up
for<00:01:59.070> the<00:01:59.160> long<00:01:59.340> range<00:01:59.670> so<00:02:00.060> i<00:02:00.120> sniping<00:02:00.660> because

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
for the long range so i sniping because

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.300 
for the long range so i sniping because
it<00:02:01.080> works<00:02:01.260> pretty<00:02:01.500> much<00:02:01.770> the<00:02:01.950> same<00:02:02.100> as<00:02:02.280> a

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
it works pretty much the same as a

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:02.930 
it works pretty much the same as a
sniper

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:02.940 
sniper

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:06.350 
sniper
now<00:02:03.540> I<00:02:04.130> actually<00:02:05.130> restarted<00:02:05.820> my<00:02:05.910> game<00:02:06.150> because

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
now I actually restarted my game because

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.200 
now I actually restarted my game because
I<00:02:06.780> wanted<00:02:07.110> to<00:02:07.170> explain<00:02:07.620> to<00:02:07.770> you<00:02:07.890> guys<00:02:07.920> that<00:02:08.430> I

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:09.210 
I wanted to explain to you guys that I

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:12.710 
I wanted to explain to you guys that I
actually<00:02:09.660> have<00:02:10.170> a<00:02:10.200> surprise<00:02:10.470> how<00:02:11.220> I<00:02:11.720> also

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
actually have a surprise how I also

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.200 
actually have a surprise how I also
think<00:02:13.320> that<00:02:13.500> there's<00:02:13.950> one<00:02:14.040> other<00:02:14.610> setup<00:02:15.060> that

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.210 
think that there's one other setup that

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:17.570 
think that there's one other setup that
you<00:02:15.330> could<00:02:15.510> use<00:02:15.750> if<00:02:15.990> you<00:02:16.260> didn't<00:02:16.560> link<00:02:16.740> the<00:02:16.860> g36

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
you could use if you didn't link the g36

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.850 
you could use if you didn't link the g36
or<00:02:17.940> if<00:02:18.390> you<00:02:18.510> preferred<00:02:18.900> using<00:02:19.140> a<00:02:19.320> sniper<00:02:19.560> as

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
or if you preferred using a sniper as

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.830 
or if you preferred using a sniper as
well<00:02:20.070> because<00:02:20.550> a<00:02:20.580> lot<00:02:20.820> of<00:02:20.850> people<00:02:21.090> can't

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
well because a lot of people can't

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.570 
well because a lot of people can't
control<00:02:22.050> the<00:02:22.350> actress<00:02:22.740> can't<00:02:23.130> control<00:02:23.490> the

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
control the actress can't control the

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.820 
control the actress can't control the
repo<00:02:23.880> on<00:02:24.000> the<00:02:24.120> g36<00:02:24.810> or<00:02:25.050> they<00:02:25.260> just<00:02:25.470> prefer<00:02:25.620> to

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
repo on the g36 or they just prefer to

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.040 
repo on the g36 or they just prefer to
not<00:02:26.160> use<00:02:26.400> it<00:02:26.580> just<00:02:26.700> because<00:02:26.910> it's<00:02:27.750> not<00:02:27.990> that

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
not use it just because it's not that

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:29.990 
not use it just because it's not that
good<00:02:28.440> of<00:02:28.560> a<00:02:28.620> gun

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
good of a gun

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.170 
good of a gun
so<00:02:30.540> one<00:02:31.200> negative<00:02:31.950> to<00:02:32.160> this<00:02:32.310> other<00:02:32.640> setup

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
so one negative to this other setup

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.870 
so one negative to this other setup
would<00:02:33.480> be<00:02:33.660> if<00:02:34.080> your<00:02:34.680> closer<00:02:35.070> range<00:02:35.460> you<00:02:35.700> don't

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
would be if your closer range you don't

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.490 
would be if your closer range you don't
have<00:02:36.030> a<00:02:36.060> second<00:02:36.510> gun<00:02:36.630> to<00:02:36.780> pull<00:02:36.960> out<00:02:37.080> and<00:02:37.260> spray

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
have a second gun to pull out and spray

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:38.960 
have a second gun to pull out and spray
with<00:02:37.680> you<00:02:37.890> just<00:02:38.070> have<00:02:38.190> a<00:02:38.220> sniper<00:02:38.550> so<00:02:38.850> you'd

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
with you just have a sniper so you'd

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:40.610 
with you just have a sniper so you'd
have<00:02:39.000> to<00:02:39.240> reload<00:02:39.600> or<00:02:39.780> switch<00:02:39.960> to<00:02:40.110> your<00:02:40.170> pistol

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
have to reload or switch to your pistol

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.330 
have to reload or switch to your pistol
but<00:02:41.220> still<00:02:41.550> going<00:02:42.390> back<00:02:42.600> to<00:02:42.750> the<00:02:42.870> subject<00:02:43.350> if

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
but still going back to the subject if

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.850 
but still going back to the subject if
you<00:02:44.850> could<00:02:45.030> only<00:02:45.180> choose<00:02:45.540> two<00:02:45.840> weapons<00:02:46.260> this

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
you could only choose two weapons this

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.760 
you could only choose two weapons this
would<00:02:47.040> be<00:02:47.160> these<00:02:47.340> two<00:02:47.730> besides<00:02:48.270> the<00:02:48.840> m4a1<00:02:49.500> and

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:49.770 
would be these two besides the m4a1 and

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:52.340 
would be these two besides the m4a1 and
the<00:02:49.950> g36<00:02:50.610> if<00:02:50.880> you<00:02:51.030> didn't<00:02:51.240> want<00:02:51.390> to<00:02:51.450> do<00:02:51.630> 36<00:02:51.930> then

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
the g36 if you didn't want to do 36 then

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:54.740 
the g36 if you didn't want to do 36 then
you<00:02:52.470> switch<00:02:52.770> the<00:02:52.980> TP<00:02:53.340> chi<00:02:53.520> the<00:02:54.030> TPG<00:02:54.600> is

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
you switch the TP chi the TPG is

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.130 
you switch the TP chi the TPG is
honestly<00:02:55.350> the<00:02:55.530> best<00:02:55.650> sniper<00:02:55.980> in<00:02:56.190> the<00:02:56.220> game<00:02:56.520> I

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:57.140 
honestly the best sniper in the game I

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:59.390 
honestly the best sniper in the game I
picked<00:02:58.140> the<00:02:58.230> GP<00:02:58.530> version<00:02:58.920> because<00:02:59.220> it's

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
picked the GP version because it's

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.520 
picked the GP version because it's
pretty<00:02:59.790> much<00:02:59.940> almost<00:03:00.450> as<00:03:00.660> accurate<00:03:01.110> I<00:03:01.260> don't

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
pretty much almost as accurate I don't

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:02.990 
pretty much almost as accurate I don't
know<00:03:01.590> if<00:03:01.739> it<00:03:01.860> is<00:03:01.950> the<00:03:02.100> same<00:03:02.280> accuracy<00:03:02.730> or<00:03:02.820> not

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
know if it is the same accuracy or not

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.020 
know if it is the same accuracy or not
but<00:03:03.209> it's<00:03:03.330> really<00:03:03.720> accurate<00:03:04.070> and<00:03:05.070> the<00:03:05.370> TVG<00:03:05.790> pro

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
but it's really accurate and the TVG pro

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:07.880 
but it's really accurate and the TVG pro
obviously<00:03:06.750> would<00:03:06.930> be<00:03:07.050> better<00:03:07.230> but<00:03:07.620> I<00:03:07.830> just

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
obviously would be better but I just

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:09.380 
obviously would be better but I just
wanted<00:03:08.310> to<00:03:08.430> show<00:03:08.580> you<00:03:08.640> guys<00:03:08.850> with<00:03:09.060> this<00:03:09.209> sniper

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
wanted to show you guys with this sniper

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:11.120 
wanted to show you guys with this sniper
that<00:03:09.600> you<00:03:09.780> could<00:03:09.930> do<00:03:10.020> just<00:03:10.050> as<00:03:10.410> well<00:03:10.560> now<00:03:11.010> in

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
that you could do just as well now in

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:12.830 
that you could do just as well now in
the<00:03:11.220> beginning<00:03:11.550> of<00:03:11.670> this<00:03:11.790> gameplay<00:03:12.060> with<00:03:12.720> the

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
the beginning of this gameplay with the

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.110 
the beginning of this gameplay with the
sniper<00:03:13.110> I<00:03:13.260> actually<00:03:13.650> kind<00:03:14.100> of<00:03:14.190> failed<00:03:14.459> but<00:03:14.880> I

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
sniper I actually kind of failed but I

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.860 
sniper I actually kind of failed but I
did<00:03:15.930> better<00:03:16.220> later<00:03:17.220> in<00:03:17.400> the<00:03:17.489> game<00:03:17.670> so<00:03:18.120> just

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
did better later in the game so just

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:22.580 
did better later in the game so just
continue<00:03:19.500> playing<00:03:19.739> this<00:03:19.920> and<00:03:20.130> talking<00:03:21.590> so

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
continue playing this and talking so

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:25.550 
continue playing this and talking so
with<00:03:23.100> the<00:03:23.220> m4a1<00:03:23.940> that's<00:03:24.510> just<00:03:24.930> ultimately<00:03:25.110> I

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
with the m4a1 that's just ultimately I

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.650 
with the m4a1 that's just ultimately I
think<00:03:25.709> the<00:03:25.950> f4<00:03:26.400> a1<00:03:26.700> is<00:03:26.850> the<00:03:26.880> best<00:03:27.239> weapon<00:03:27.570> in

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
think the f4 a1 is the best weapon in

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:27.949 
think the f4 a1 is the best weapon in
the<00:03:27.690> game

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959 
the game

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:31.250 
the game
besides<00:03:28.590> the<00:03:28.739> g36<00:03:29.370> but<00:03:29.940> I<00:03:30.300> don't<00:03:30.900> want<00:03:31.050> to<00:03:31.080> talk

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
besides the g36 but I don't want to talk

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.050 
besides the g36 but I don't want to talk
about<00:03:31.320> the<00:03:31.590> g36<00:03:32.190> too<00:03:32.340> much<00:03:32.520> because<00:03:32.730> that's

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
about the g36 too much because that's

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.150 
about the g36 too much because that's
just<00:03:33.330> like<00:03:33.690> the<00:03:33.959> most<00:03:34.110> common<00:03:34.650> weapon<00:03:34.800> in<00:03:35.040> the

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160 
just like the most common weapon in the

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.190 
just like the most common weapon in the
game<00:03:35.340> and<00:03:35.670> a<00:03:36.239> lot<00:03:36.390> of<00:03:36.420> people<00:03:36.690> can<00:03:36.840> get<00:03:36.989> bored

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
game and a lot of people can get bored

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:25.930 
further across the map but it will be

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:28.740 
further across the map but it will be
harder<00:04:26.260> to<00:04:26.290> go<00:04:26.620> in<00:04:27.430> for<00:04:27.760> more<00:04:27.910> unbelievable<00:04:28.180> so

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:56.740 
I'd probably just go modular backpack

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:58.230 
I'd probably just go modular backpack
and<00:04:56.920> just<00:04:57.070> go<00:04:57.220> like<00:04:57.400> NX<00:04:57.760> whore<00:04:57.970> or<00:04:58.090> something

00:04:59.610 --> 00:04:59.620 
like that just get a whole bunch of

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:01.290 
like that just get a whole bunch of
submachine<00:05:00.100> guns<00:05:00.310> and<00:05:00.490> one<00:05:00.670> assault<00:05:00.970> rifle

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:01.300 
submachine guns and one assault rifle

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:03.150 
submachine guns and one assault rifle
something<00:05:01.660> like<00:05:01.780> that<00:05:01.960> but<00:05:02.620> that's<00:05:02.800> not<00:05:02.980> the

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:03.160 
something like that but that's not the

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:06.210 
something like that but that's not the
topic<00:05:03.580> of<00:05:03.760> this<00:05:03.910> video<00:05:04.650> so<00:05:05.650> as<00:05:05.770> you<00:05:05.890> can<00:05:05.980> see<00:05:06.040> if

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:06.220 
topic of this video so as you can see if

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:08.100 
topic of this video so as you can see if
you<00:05:06.310> had<00:05:06.400> the<00:05:06.520> g36<00:05:07.180> you<00:05:07.330> could<00:05:07.480> still<00:05:07.720> do<00:05:07.930> these

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:08.110 
you had the g36 you could still do these

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:10.230 
you had the g36 you could still do these
shots<00:05:08.350> but<00:05:08.680> it'd<00:05:08.800> be<00:05:08.830> a<00:05:08.980> lot<00:05:09.190> harder<00:05:09.430> and<00:05:09.790> you

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:10.240 
shots but it'd be a lot harder and you

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:12.480 
shots but it'd be a lot harder and you
have<00:05:10.420> to<00:05:10.600> hit<00:05:10.900> them<00:05:11.080> three<00:05:11.380> times<00:05:11.590> if<00:05:11.980> not<00:05:12.220> once

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:12.490 
have to hit them three times if not once

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:15.480 
have to hit them three times if not once
in<00:05:12.640> the<00:05:12.730> head<00:05:13.440> instead<00:05:14.440> of<00:05:14.710> just<00:05:14.950> one<00:05:15.220> sniper

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:15.490 
in the head instead of just one sniper

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:18.090 
in the head instead of just one sniper
shot<00:05:15.940> so<00:05:16.420> that's<00:05:16.540> where<00:05:16.750> the<00:05:16.870> sniper<00:05:17.140> setup<00:05:17.890> is

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:18.100 
shot so that's where the sniper setup is

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:21.240 
shot so that's where the sniper setup is
more<00:05:18.520> is<00:05:18.790> like<00:05:19.180> different<00:05:19.420> so<00:05:19.990> I<00:05:20.320> guess

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:21.250 
more is like different so I guess

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:22.890 
more is like different so I guess
ultimately<00:05:21.460> if<00:05:22.000> you<00:05:22.090> had<00:05:22.210> to<00:05:22.300> bring<00:05:22.450> two<00:05:22.660> guns

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:22.900 
ultimately if you had to bring two guns
