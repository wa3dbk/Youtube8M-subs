right now as we know no metro north in

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.539 
right now as we know no metro north in
or<00:01:42.869> out<00:01:43.020> of<00:01:43.170> grand<00:01:43.409> central<00:01:43.770> station<00:01:43.829> because

or out of grand central station because

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.280 
or out of grand central station because
of<00:01:44.729> this<00:01:44.820> fire<00:01:45.060> still<00:01:45.689> we<00:01:45.840> look<00:01:46.020> at<00:01:46.170> this

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
of this fire still we look at this

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.100 
of this fire still we look at this
location<00:01:46.890> and<00:01:47.430> and<00:01:48.000> from<00:01:48.390> different<00:01:48.750> angles

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
location and and from different angles

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.330 
location and and from different angles
of<00:01:49.229> course<00:01:49.439> you<00:01:49.530> couldn't<00:01:49.740> it<00:01:49.860> first<00:01:50.130> see<00:01:50.310> the

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
of course you couldn't it first see the

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.550 
of course you couldn't it first see the
flames<00:01:50.670> until<00:01:51.060> now<00:01:51.329> and<00:01:51.659> it's<00:01:51.990> really<00:01:52.350> quite

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
horrendous you have to wonder how much

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.300 
horrendous you have to wonder how much
manpower<00:01:54.270> be<00:01:55.140> going<00:01:55.500> toward<00:01:55.770> at<00:01:55.920> least<00:01:56.100> trying

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
manpower be going toward at least trying

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:57.889 
manpower be going toward at least trying

to extinguish and then see what we have

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:01.249 
to extinguish and then see what we have
in<00:01:58.079> front<00:01:58.560> of<00:01:58.710> us<00:01:59.299> that<00:02:00.299> is<00:02:00.479> true<00:02:00.719> Lori<00:02:00.960> I<00:02:01.049> means

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.530 
right next to of course the FDR Drive as
well<00:02:13.860> now<00:02:14.040> right<00:02:14.310> now<00:02:14.459> that<00:02:14.880> does<00:02:15.090> not<00:02:15.120> look<00:02:15.300> to

well now right now that does not look to
be<00:02:15.660> affected<00:02:16.140> at<00:02:16.260> this<00:02:16.410> point<00:02:16.620> the<00:02:16.739> FDR<00:02:16.980> itself

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
be affected at this point the FDR itself

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:19.430 
be affected at this point the FDR itself
really<00:02:17.880> no<00:02:18.060> traffic<00:02:18.450> on<00:02:18.599> that<00:02:18.780> but<00:02:19.050> again<00:02:19.080> this

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
really no traffic on that but again this

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.229 
really no traffic on that but again this
smoke<00:02:19.709> and<00:02:19.950> right<00:02:20.370> now<00:02:20.520> it's<00:02:20.640> blowing<00:02:20.970> in<00:02:21.090> like

in westerly southwesterly direction so

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:25.970 
in westerly southwesterly direction so
the<00:02:24.060> smoke<00:02:24.270> may<00:02:24.510> start<00:02:24.810> affecting<00:02:25.290> the<00:02:25.590> FDR

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
the smoke may start affecting the FDR

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.770 
the smoke may start affecting the FDR

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
but of course that can change at any

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:48.860 
but of course that can change at any
time<00:02:47.610> and<00:02:47.790> when<00:02:47.940> you<00:02:48.030> look<00:02:48.239> at<00:02:48.390> the<00:02:48.480> amount<00:02:48.720> of

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
time and when you look at the amount of

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:50.420 
time and when you look at the amount of
the<00:02:48.959> pollution<00:02:49.230> that<00:02:49.470> smoke<00:02:49.890> and<00:02:50.069> how<00:02:50.130> thick

the pollution that smoke and how thick
and<00:02:50.610> heavy<00:02:50.760> it<00:02:50.970> is<00:02:51.090> then<00:02:51.690> you<00:02:51.780> have<00:02:51.900> to<00:02:52.019> wonder

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
and heavy it is then you have to wonder

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:53.840 
and heavy it is then you have to wonder
about<00:02:52.410> the<00:02:52.620> visibility<00:02:53.250> and<00:02:53.340> how<00:02:53.489> much<00:02:53.640> that

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
about the visibility and how much that

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:56.990 
about the visibility and how much that

but very similar in nature yet all right

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:23.029 
but very similar in nature yet all right
and<00:04:21.720> then<00:04:21.840> you<00:04:21.930> have<00:04:22.109> to<00:04:22.140> start<00:04:22.530> mapping<00:04:22.740> out

00:04:23.029 --> 00:04:23.039 
and then you have to start mapping out

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:24.580 
and then you have to start mapping out
what<00:04:23.250> the<00:04:23.370> alternatives<00:04:24.060> are

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:24.590 
what the alternatives are

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:26.560 
what the alternatives are
let's<00:04:24.860> assume<00:04:25.220> that<00:04:25.280> a<00:04:25.520> course<00:04:26.210> it's<00:04:26.389> shut

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:26.570 
let's assume that a course it's shut

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:28.659 
let's assume that a course it's shut
down<00:04:26.600> right<00:04:27.020> now<00:04:27.230> three<00:04:27.590> lines<00:04:27.800> but<00:04:28.040> so<00:04:28.400> what

00:04:28.659 --> 00:04:28.669 
down right now three lines but so what

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:32.020 
down right now three lines but so what
what<00:04:29.389> are<00:04:29.540> the<00:04:29.630> options<00:04:30.100> well<00:04:31.100> it's<00:04:31.370> we<00:04:31.880> have

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:32.030 
what are the options well it's we have

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:34.120 
what are the options well it's we have
not<00:04:32.240> yet<00:04:32.270> put<00:04:32.570> together<00:04:32.750> a<00:04:33.020> plan<00:04:33.530> I<00:04:33.770> couldn't

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:34.130 
not yet put together a plan I couldn't

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:36.219 
not yet put together a plan I couldn't
tell<00:04:34.310> you<00:04:34.370> you<00:04:35.120> know<00:04:35.240> certainly<00:04:35.660> Lexington

00:04:36.219 --> 00:04:36.229

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:43.370 
customers to do this just happened

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:44.980 
customers to do this just happened
moments<00:04:43.460> ago<00:04:43.639> and<00:04:44.000> the<00:04:44.150> subways<00:04:44.479> are<00:04:44.510> totally

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:44.990 
moments ago and the subways are totally

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:46.420 
moments ago and the subways are totally
unaffected<00:04:45.350> they<00:04:45.650> take<00:04:45.860> their<00:04:46.040> own<00:04:46.160> bridge

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:46.430

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:48.129 
unaffected they take their own bridge
separate<00:04:46.880> from<00:04:47.060> this<00:04:47.210> I<00:04:47.389> think<00:04:47.690> they<00:04:47.780> funneled

00:04:48.129 --> 00:04:48.139 
separate from this I think they funneled

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:50.860

yet<00:04:48.350> they<00:04:48.530> do<00:04:48.650> okay<00:04:49.400> and<00:04:49.639> that's<00:04:50.060> so<00:04:50.270> I<00:04:50.690> mean

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:50.870 
yet they do okay and that's so I mean

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:52.120

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:52.130 
for people who don't realize I guess the

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:53.980 
for people who don't realize I guess the
best<00:04:52.280> I<00:04:52.550> used<00:04:52.699> to<00:04:52.790> take<00:04:52.940> this<00:04:53.120> route<00:04:53.360> every<00:04:53.870> day
