00:00:04.609 --> 00:00:08.719
 increased window tightness may 

00:00:06.929 --> 00:00:10.290
 lead to change 

00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:12.440
 temperature and humidity conditions in 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.400
 indoors and as a result 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:17.480
 surface moisture compensation 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:20.460
 glazing so-called fogging 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:22.410
 according to the letter of the state building allowed 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.080
 temporary condensate formation on 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.550
 inner glass windows why 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.590
 plastic windows are crying 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.230
 we asked this question to a specialist 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.789
 apple company 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:34.710
 causes of condensation may 

00:00:32.789 --> 00:00:37.380
 be insufficient temperature conditions in 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:40.020
 indoors the so -called not ready or 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.850
 high humidity room humidity 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.970
 air may rise by several 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:47.790
 reasons for example recently completed 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:49.590
 construction or repair work availability 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:52.220
 on the windowsills of a large number 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.540
 indoor plants poor performance 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:57.840
 ventilation in the room 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:01:00.120
 or lack thereof 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.489
 heating in telavi niche lack 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.100
 heating devices under the translucent 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.960
 construction wide sill width 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.030
 ceiling heating devices 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.090
 what prevents warm convection 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.900
 air to the bottom of the glass 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:14.610
 such processes of life 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.580
 human like washing 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:20.130
 cooking mopping as much as possible 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.790
 to prevent occurrence of condensation 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.920
 prevent condensation is necessary to adjust 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:27.420
 temperature and humidity conditions of the room 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:29.250
 natural room ventilation should 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.530
 carried out by the flow of air 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.939
 through the vents or special 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.540
 hole in the doors 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:38.939
 this could be the top loop either 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.020
 built-in sash exhaust valve 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:42.060
 channel openings should 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.960
 be covered in kitchens and bathrooms 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.810
 rooms 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.759
 lavatories and drying cabinets required 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.860
 show air change is 3 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:52.740
 cubic meters of air per square meter 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.270
 room for an hour how to 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.189
 air the room so that 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.799
 prevent condensation 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:01.470
 for example in a three-room apartment near 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:03.390
 ten square meters of windows really 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:06.630
 closed window skips one and a half 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:09.269
 cubic meters per square meter per hour this 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.300
 total inflow of approximately 15 cubic meters per 

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:12.730
 hour 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:16.810
 in such a room need air flow 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:19.030
 110 140 cubic meters per hour in this way 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:22.300
 only 10-15 percent is provided 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:24.880
 required inflow in the apartment 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:28.000
 50 square meters volume is 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:30.520
 140 cubic meters per hour with gas 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.810
 slabs required every 140th meters 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:33.940
 fresh air 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:35.680
 This means that every hour you need 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:38.650
 completely replace the internal air 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:40.360
 shock or through ventilation is not 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:42.460
 forget to air regularly 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:45.720
 room in this case your windows 

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:45.720
 will never cry 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:52.810
 eco windows for eco life
