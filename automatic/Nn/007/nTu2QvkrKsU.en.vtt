disqualification<00:02:18.209> which<00:02:18.390> I<00:02:18.569> think<00:02:18.780> a<00:02:18.810> lot<00:02:18.959> of

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:18.989 
disqualification which I think a lot of

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:20.479 
disqualification which I think a lot of
people<00:02:19.079> saw<00:02:19.409> happening<00:02:19.859> I<00:02:19.980> really<00:02:20.189> didn't<00:02:20.400> see

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:26.609 
his presence known on but i guess this

00:02:26.609 --> 00:02:29.059 
his presence known on but i guess this
does<00:02:27.359> set<00:02:27.689> up<00:02:27.870> that<00:02:28.079> triple<00:02:28.379> threat<00:02:28.590> match<00:02:28.620> or

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:29.069 
does set up that triple threat match or

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:30.860 
does set up that triple threat match or
maybe<00:02:29.280> if<00:02:29.430> we're<00:02:29.609> all<00:02:29.760> lucky<00:02:29.939> we<00:02:30.420> can<00:02:30.540> just<00:02:30.689> get

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
maybe if we're all lucky we can just get

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:32.449 
maybe if we're all lucky we can just get
the<00:02:30.959> single<00:02:31.170> match<00:02:31.469> that<00:02:31.859> vet<00:02:32.099> is<00:02:32.219> just

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
the single match that vet is just

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:34.970 
the single match that vet is just
straight-up<00:02:32.900> cena<00:02:33.900> vs<00:02:34.230> punk<00:02:34.500> i<00:02:34.650> think<00:02:34.829> doesn't

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
straight-up cena vs punk i think doesn't

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.649 
straight-up cena vs punk i think doesn't
match<00:02:35.280> to<00:02:35.459> a<00:02:35.519> lot<00:02:35.670> of<00:02:35.760> people<00:02:35.969> are<00:02:36.060> going<00:02:36.450> to<00:02:36.569> be

I<00:04:37.390> think<00:04:37.840> when<00:04:37.990> you<00:04:38.080> have<00:04:38.260> the<00:04:38.410> US

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:38.680 
I think when you have the US

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:40.350 
I think when you have the US
Championship<00:04:39.640> it<00:04:39.760> doesn't<00:04:40.000> count<00:04:40.120> bleck

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:40.360 
Championship it doesn't count bleck

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:43.500
