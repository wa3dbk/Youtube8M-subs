00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 hello very good dear subscribers 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.970
 here we are with this new video for 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.069
 the new video channel of gta 5 by 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.780
 course and here I am going to bring you a 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.460
 thing that has happened to me and then some 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.309
 things that have seemed to me a little 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.379
 rare not and other interesting ones are worth it 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.750
 that nothing goes with it is worth the first 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:21.570
 is that today nothing more to get up on 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.699
 the play I have entered the game of gta iv 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.140
 when getting into the online mode has 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.480
 returned by saying so the game to the 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.359
 childhood with these graphics is worth 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.859
 playstation one of that playstation 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.870
 I do not know if you're seeing it all 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.969
 the map is practically unloaded 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.250
 remember the game of rats or rugrats 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.809
 I do not know how you call it, you were a 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.100
 television series that I saw when 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.629
 it was small that they then took out a game 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.270
 for playstation one as you see 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.039
 I had exactly the same graphics 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.530
 with which he has appeared and this morning 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.030
 in the gta online here you can see 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.129
 clearly what he has played 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.780
 playstation 1 will give me the reason with 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.309
 these guys with this kind of graphics 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.140
 but well this is simply something that 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.449
 It happened to me today when I got up 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.500
 so nothing further from there no no no 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.480
 there is nothing more strange 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.970
 let's go with the next clip this is a 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.990
 party that to me clearly clearly 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.579
 It smells like an orgy 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.860
 we would have to come to what would be this 

00:01:08.579 --> 00:01:13.680
 island here is worth where there is a strange 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:16.350
 cottage and here at night they are organized 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.090
 well, a strange party, not like we can 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.490
 observe there are three people at the stake 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:23.039
 we have some boxes of pizza on the floor 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.659
 we have we also have bottles of 

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:26.159
 coca-cola or whatever it is worth what 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.049
 better they are not cocacola because it would have 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.640
 to pay the cocacola not if 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.679
 the mark would come out but good in short 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.710
 we have a cabin full of drums 

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:36.179
 also beer from these cans 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.520
 of beer from these big ones that get 

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:40.500
 in the beer dispensers do not and 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.539
 we also have barrels barrels was the 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.740
 word fuck barrels like like a 

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:45.090
 man goes out barrels fuck me 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.009
 I worked as a waiter 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.479
 Well well we have that cabin there 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.369
 where we have strange mattresses 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.470
 dirty mattresses by the way dirty there 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:54.659
 something safe and good has been done 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.130
 then we have a uncle an uncle of color and 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.319
 then we also have two girls- 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.149
 It's worth two girls well 

00:01:58.319 --> 00:02:03.060
 basically this smells like a 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:05.250
 cabin on an island with alcohol mattresses 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.649
 the bonfire two half-naked aunts 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:10.049
 this is clearly an orgy party 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:11.459
 to make an orgy that hallucinates but 

00:02:10.049 --> 00:02:12.930
 well this has seemed quite strange 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.920
 so good is a curiosity you 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.780
 You can also comment 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.090
 above all it looks like this but it's 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.480
 pretty clear it 's pretty clear what 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:23.670
 is what I say basically so 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.810
 we go with the following click here there is no 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.069
 Nothing else to do if you want to fuck the 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.840
 party then you put on top of the 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:29.760
 you stay alive and then 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.680
 they come running scared worth that already 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.720
 that you can do so much here but 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.340
 eye in reality do not do it there is 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.380
 other ways to fuck a party in the 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.030
 reality that they do not burn where I live 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.319
 for example you put some glasses on the penis 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.810
 and you take your pants down to the 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:44.310
 knees and greet people is good 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.420
 I do not want to give more ideas than more than one 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.830
 I see you this weekend asking 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.959
 money to his mother to buy a 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:50.430
 phase so nothing we go with the next 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:51.720
 eclipse is a mission that I thought 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.830
 quite interesting especially if 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.810
 you want to make funny time with the 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:56.190
 friends is this broadcast we will have it in 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:57.600
 online game in the you have the 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:59.459
 description of course so that the 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:01.230
 you can download and play ballet the 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:04.170
 departure is called as you have seen there 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:06.510
 Plains big scary aliens touch the 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:09.150
 eggs already the title tells us that it's going to 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:10.769
 be epic in the mission and if the truth is 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:13.230
 that the mission is quite good we can 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:15.000
 find in it then special cars 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:17.069
 how can the espai docker be between 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.079
 others also because as you can see we have the 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:21.250
 sky live the helicopter this dragonfly 

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:24.100
 oliver hula or whatever you want to call it 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:25.720
 and as you can see in the background the UFO is also worth 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:26.950
 of some charged plains that we can 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:29.650
 find also on the track 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:31.840
 landing in the area in the alien I say 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:33.790
 in the UFO we can ride without any 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:36.730
 kind of problem to the alien we can not 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:39.010
 ride perverts in the UFO wanted 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:40.540
 say we can ride as you see it seems 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:41.980
 that we are like floating when we 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:43.720
 we climb on top of what you are going to see 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:45.130
 then here you will escape with the 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:46.750
 helicopter and the truth is that they are 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:48.280
 a few meters but I get down and I 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:50.709
 I'm floating there in the air 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:53.350
 but I suppose it will be a bug that is coming 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:55.300
 included within the lond and not so 

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:56.440
 well basically this is the mission this 

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:58.150
 has been the video I hope you have 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:59.560
 enjoyed if so do not hesitate to give 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:01.360
 live favorites and see you in the 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:03.989
 next a greeting and until next time 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:03.989
 goodbye
