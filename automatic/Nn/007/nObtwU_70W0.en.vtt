 yes 

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:08.140
 you 

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:12.590
 ah 

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:19.670
 and so much 

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:21.680
 a tire take more than a thousand years to 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:23.870
 degrade the other option is 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:27.170
 represent it as being in a company 

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:29.510
 Aspe who recycles rhodes to forgive the 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:33.430
 circulation a danish is alvin in 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:33.430
 money consumption and pollution 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.690
 a tire is with post see more than 26 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.370
 elements of natural rubber also already 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.010
 synthetic rubber that is extracted 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.930
 generally from crude oil of 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.990
 great pair of herbal products d'elx 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:54.440
 hydrocarbons film 'latics' of cloth and 

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:57.120
 additives with the zinc oxide on 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:59.190
 etcetera of a polluting power 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.280
 both in water manufacturing with 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.350
 despair in the destruction 1 matic tarda 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.170
 more than 1000 wide degrade and 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.930
 disappear from nature but there is no longer 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.460
 another less polluting possibility the 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.619
 recycling of networks 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:17.900
 pull a second life and continue as 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.900
 tire or as andrÃ©s products 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.370
 in this factory this reverse tires 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:37.160
 used the elves of the workshops in 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:40.370
 Shrek flee already worn out mistakes 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:43.370
 so the unload the operators analyze 

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:45.619
 the status of each tire a peru for 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:48.530
 an exhaustive selection elaborate who 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:50.900
 power is in a better state 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:54.710
 I will have a second life one time 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:56.930
 recycle be in better condition and not be 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:58.729
 you see in to turn the road to 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:01.220
 center a process that distinguishes 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:04.990
 structures maybe the networks stop 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:04.990
 of change of tourism 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.190
 to errors of change that are not vision 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.380
 but recycling is take laser that lasts 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.600
 which will be used in the 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:19.240
 steel industry and for the 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:21.670
 manufacture of lingua beams and so on 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:23.920
 it's tires in better condition one vegada 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:26.380
 shred sanz a by-product is extracted 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:28.690
 which is of a great base being that will serve 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:31.120
 to make various products and turn to 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:33.130
 pose on the market a material that without 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.260
 or extract to would be highly 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:38.290
 pollutant and a grover and for the 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:39.850
 natura among the different products 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:42.250
 that we manufacture alcohol in our 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:44.190
 we recycled products factory 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:46.030
 tiles for playgrounds 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:48.820
 taught at the biomechanics institute 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:52.360
 de valencia we manufacture the mushrooms for 

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:55.060
 gyms and special floors we manufacture 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:57.550
 also the special cigars 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:59.980
 insulators as well as products 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:01.810
 industrial as for example we could 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.300
 have the rollers used in 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:08.010
 textile machinery we can manufacture 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:11.650
 also stops for trailers and trailers 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:13.870
 as well as mobile stops for 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:16.299
 truck trailers 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:18.790
 a table on the farm is can be tracks 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:20.650
 of athletics like that with artificial spark 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:23.049
 that is can use so for cannes de 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:25.629
 soccer with golf plates before the 

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:27.190
 consequently water is forgotten too 

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:29.709
 can be applied to the construction of 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:31.900
 guardrails for the road that are 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:34.299
 more secure the benefit that 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:37.170
 we would get with this product would be the 

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:40.329
 cushion the impact of a motorcyclist 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:42.190
 over the guardrail mitigating the 

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:43.769
 effector verse that would have the mutilation 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:46.130
 as those that currently exist 

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:48.140
 metallic 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:50.690
 only that is tires that is in 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:53.840
 the best state go to the factory 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:56.470
 so if you continue in various processes but 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:59.330
 You will get a product in total guarantee 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:02.180
 we are able to renew a tire 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:03.980
 out of use and give it a second life 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:05.710
 useful with the same characteristics and 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:09.500
 benefits that a tire would have 

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:11.060
 standard are approved by the 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:12.650
 Ministry of Energy Industry with 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:15.200
 all certifications and 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:17.380
 benefits are exactly the same as 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:20.209
 we could find them in the market 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:22.670
 the first shock was a scraped colomos 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:25.610
 the 'eleven' eliminates the rubber band that you 

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:27.860
 deum to you who is subsequently bathe 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:31.010
 good solution see that the foam rubber a 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:32.960
 paste better and spas the sticker on 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:35.960
 human process is nothing nothing else is 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:38.360
 put new rubber 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:39.970
 in the housing both the flank area 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:43.150
 as the zone of bands tread 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:46.030
 logically based on a profile already 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:48.250
 designed in the innovative 

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:50.710
 then the roadstead goes through a process of 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:53.890
 vulcanization ones transforms the rubber 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:55.900
 plastic in the star of Rodenses posen 

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:59.200
 in a sprint ses to a certain 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:01.590
 pressure tells in this process is way 

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:04.470
 also the drawing of the roadstead 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:06.000
 once the wheels and vulcanized in 

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:08.280
 the last phase of the process is a process 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.230
 of final inspection of the tire with 

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:12.510
 this we guarantee that all the wheels 

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:15.450
 that come to the market meets the most 

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:17.760
 strict quality standards 

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:19.320
 guarantee is not only the process of 

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:21.900
 industrial tire manufacture 

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:23.920
 but it is homologated by different 

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:26.110
 European regulations 

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:28.120
 it is the matrix and always for waiting 

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:30.400
 install in qualsevol of this years of 

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:32.590
 the chain here we have the tires 

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:34.480
 with those who usually circulate in 

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:37.300
 the vehicles in this country as you are 

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:40.150
 seeing quite badly what they do saturated 

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:42.340
 is to pick them up only 25 per 

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:44.500
 hundred of them are are fit and what 

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:45.700
 it is given a second life in this 

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:48.160
 type of product that you are seeing here 

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:50.980
 a product that passes exactly the 

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:53.740
 same tests as a new tire in 

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:56.530
 which in a conventional user does not go 

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:59.170
 to appreciate any kind of difference what 

00:05:56.530 --> 00:06:02.289
 which is a product that is much more 

00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:04.809
 ecological and much more economical 

00:06:02.289 --> 00:06:07.689
 a renewed tourism tire prevents 

00:06:04.809 --> 00:06:10.689
 throw into the atmosphere a 70 4 kilos of 

00:06:07.689 --> 00:06:12.879
 co2 that got into manufacturing it sinks 

00:06:10.689 --> 00:06:17.300
 nou they deliver a truck tire 

00:06:12.879 --> 00:06:19.159
 you avoid the start of sense so much kilos 

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:21.319
 to that your thing that you walk product 

00:06:19.159 --> 00:06:23.629
 recycled from this company is says of 

00:06:21.319 --> 00:06:27.020
 maitres sad millions de tom is from co2 to 

00:06:23.629 --> 00:06:28.970
 the atmosphere month after a reduction 

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:30.949
 significant in oil consumption 

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:33.710
 regarding the manufacture of a 

00:06:30.949 --> 00:06:37.360
 tire completely 

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:41.150
 ecological renewed tires 

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:43.220
 consume less liters of oil 

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:45.500
 we could say approximately that if 

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:47.300
 a new standard tire consumes 

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:49.880
 approximately about 35 liters of 

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:52.400
 oil a tire I renew just 

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:54.230
 will consume approximately five and a half 

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:56.480
 six liters of oil that is to say we are 

00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:59.110
 producing a saving of about 30 liters 

00:06:56.480 --> 00:07:01.180
 per manufactured tire 

00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:03.190
 That means it is conseguis 

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:04.780
 send some of wynn millions of barrels 

00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:07.060
 of oil per year 

00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:09.310
 the company is investigating no of 

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:12.270
 ways to produce more tires 

00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:16.000
 ecological of a time to this part 

00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:18.220
 this society has invested in the 

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:23.830
 product innovation and has launched 

00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:26.260
 a new, greener range in which 

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:28.600
 the amount of energy needed for 

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:30.520
 making a renewed tire is 

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:32.620
 less and the amount of consumption of 

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:35.680
 raw material in turn is also 

00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:37.960
 minimizes it also allows us to put in 

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:40.150
 the market a tire with the same 

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:41.710
 benefits but cheaper 

00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:45.030
 approximately we can be talking 

00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:45.030
 of 50 percent 

00:07:45.190 --> 00:07:49.840
 a whole series of vantage waiting to donate 

00:07:47.590 --> 00:07:51.880
 a second life as tires a 

00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:55.150
 necessary product but to also 

00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:57.460
 pollutes that a recycled waste is 

00:07:55.150 --> 00:07:59.020
 daily CO2 emissions and consumption 

00:07:57.460 --> 00:08:01.600
 Petroleum 

00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:03.630
 one way is to take care of the environment 

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:03.630
 ambient
