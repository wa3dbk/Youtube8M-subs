smash wind up get out of the way Oh see
that's<00:02:53.660> a<00:02:53.780> good<00:02:53.900> example<00:02:54.200> of<00:02:54.380> why<00:02:54.500> we're<00:02:54.680> happy

00:02:54.789 --> 00:02:54.799 
that's a good example of why we're happy

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:56.289 
that's a good example of why we're happy
we<00:02:55.040> got<00:02:55.190> all<00:02:55.310> those<00:02:55.430> yellow<00:02:55.670> rocks<00:02:55.970> out<00:02:56.180> of<00:02:56.209> the

00:02:56.289 --> 00:02:56.299 
we got all those yellow rocks out of the

00:02:56.299 --> 00:02:58.539 
we got all those yellow rocks out of the
way<00:02:56.389> normally<00:02:57.380> he'd<00:02:57.560> be<00:02:57.709> knocking<00:02:58.069> them<00:02:58.160> with

00:02:58.539 --> 00:02:58.549 
way normally he'd be knocking them with

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:00.520 
way normally he'd be knocking them with
his<00:02:58.700> own<00:02:58.849> attacks<00:02:59.269> but<00:03:00.109> it<00:03:00.200> does<00:03:00.319> let<00:03:00.500> you

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.530 
his own attacks but it does let you

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:02.170 
his own attacks but it does let you
maneuver<00:03:01.010> around<00:03:01.130> that's<00:03:01.730> why<00:03:01.880> it's<00:03:02.030> a<00:03:02.060> good

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.180 
maneuver around that's why it's a good

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:03.610 
maneuver around that's why it's a good
idea<00:03:02.299> to<00:03:02.480> get<00:03:02.660> them<00:03:02.780> out<00:03:02.840> of<00:03:02.870> there<00:03:03.049> before<00:03:03.290> you

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620 
idea to get them out of there before you

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.550 
idea to get them out of there before you
start<00:03:03.889> the<00:03:04.010> fight
