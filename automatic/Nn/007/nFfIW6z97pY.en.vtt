00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.009
 Hello 2 lessons deuce go 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:16.289
 immediately did this first movement this 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:19.050
 us jumping on 2 heels is very simple 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.010
 movement starts soon chick so here 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.460
 sit on the sock 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:27.420
 so we have heels the floor they touched well 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:29.720
 do n't sit still can you say some hand 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:33.149
 For example, we put the left back 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:36.059
 knees forward send us knees 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.710
 by ourselves now we pull forward 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:41.219
 when we put our hand back 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:43.290
 right hand set or as a visor on 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:46.469
 head or belt 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.910
 no equality fist hand someone like 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.860
 conveniently 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:50.430
 farther you jump legs right 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.289
 diagonal 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.680
 that is, if we left hand that I am on the floor 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:57.570
 that we jump to the right diagonal on 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.940
 completely straight legs we do not jump 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.660
 so here we do not do legs slightly 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.760
 bent 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.719
 that it was firstly beautiful in 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.420
 the second is not hard 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:10.200
 further we bounce back again 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.670
 heels plan touch doing again 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.140
 set in the original position 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.820
 it's only the first time then you will 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.290
 immediately began to transfer to the original 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.610
 floor position 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:23.479
 now put your other hand on the floor back 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:25.740
 left hand on the visor or on the belt and 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:27.420
 now we jump in the other direction 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.720
 that is, in the left diagonal 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.280
 as if forward but a little bit to the left so 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.400
 to look at the skill that is 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.259
 not like that socks looked astride and 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.890
 on heels jumped back 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:42.329
 movement has come to this position again 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.659
 how much is simple that there is nothing here 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:47.939
 grind how to put your hands again 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.070

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:58.040
 I put my hand jumps hop hop and now u 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.800

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:04.790
 drove on the second movement is very 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:07.250
 it looks like you are in a position too 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:08.000
 we also sit on socks but we put our hand 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:14.660
 not back 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:18.040
 and God did not go back like this 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:20.870
 conveniently put your hand to the right and put 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:24.550
 from here we are already leaping 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:30.800
 god second put on a belt and jump 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:33.080
 god and we cut the legs with scissors such 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:33.860
 so that when we have our left hand 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:36.500
 standing on the floor 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:36.980
 our left foot is flying forward and our right 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.470
 backwards 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:40.570
 left foot stood on its heels on the right on 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:42.980
 sock 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:44.890
 bounce back again to the original 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:47.900
 position convenient connection falling 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:50.750
 now god puts his right hand left hand 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:52.100
 We put on the belt and the same thing if we 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.380
 right hand shame on the floor 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:58.360
 then our legs from the Middle of the hand 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:03:01.280
 there is a right fly forward and left back 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:03.410
 forefoot always stands on heels up 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.970
 her leg is always on hand to mask 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:08.329
 belt 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:10.850
 jumped up again put watch 

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:13.400
 so that the legs were about equal 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:15.739
 distance from the arm that is not somewhere 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:20.440
 in front and not somewhere behind 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:23.150
 and in the center so that the hand shares the legs 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:24.799
 about the center if you will 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:27.140
 put a hand a major mistake if you 

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:29.150
 will deliver your hand far ahead then you 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:32.750
 you will jump like that 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:35.570

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:36.730
 hand to put back what will you have here 

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:39.380
 such a movement 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:41.030
 many will be far ahead this too 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:43.700
 wrong is not that wrong and 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:46.220
 beautiful so the hand with and here's straight 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:46.680
