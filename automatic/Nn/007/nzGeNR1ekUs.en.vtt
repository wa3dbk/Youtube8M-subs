happen<00:01:23.250> on<00:01:23.369> the<00:01:23.490> first<00:01:23.729> try<00:01:24.119> koishi<00:01:25.729> but<00:01:26.729> it

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
happen on the first try koishi but it

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.569 
happen on the first try koishi but it
won't<00:01:27.930> take<00:01:28.229> too<00:01:28.500> long<00:01:28.530> hopefully<00:01:29.100> I<00:01:29.310> can<00:01:29.400> get

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
won't take too long hopefully I can get

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.390 
won't take too long hopefully I can get
it<00:01:29.700> this<00:01:29.820> time<00:01:30.799> so<00:01:31.799> you<00:01:31.829> just<00:01:31.920> do<00:01:32.130> the<00:01:32.250> same

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400

thing that's it the last time take the

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.090 
thing that's it the last time take the
block<00:01:34.170> of<00:01:34.320> iron<00:01:34.439> move<00:01:34.680> it<00:01:34.770> up<00:01:34.860> to<00:01:34.979> the

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
block of iron move it up to the

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:35.749 
block of iron move it up to the
ingredients

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
ingredients

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.060 
ingredients
hold<00:01:36.420> it<00:01:36.630> kind<00:01:36.960> of<00:01:37.049> popped<00:01:37.439> out<00:01:37.590> right<00:01:37.829> there<00:01:38.040> a

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
hold it kind of popped out right there a

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.149 
hold it kind of popped out right there a
little<00:01:38.280> bit<00:01:38.460> might<00:01:38.790> messed<00:01:39.030> it<00:01:39.180> up<00:01:39.590> but<00:01:40.590> anyway

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
little bit might messed it up but anyway

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.700 
little bit might messed it up but anyway
hopefully<00:01:41.490> this<00:01:41.729> should<00:01:41.939> happen<00:01:42.360> soon<00:01:42.750> it's

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
hopefully this should happen soon it's

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:50.480 
hopefully this should happen soon it's
kind<00:01:44.250> of<00:01:44.369> not<00:01:44.909> very<00:01:45.119> reliable<00:01:47.780> and<00:01:49.250> the<00:01:50.250> sad

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
kind of not very reliable and the sad

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.700 
kind of not very reliable and the sad
part<00:01:50.520> is<00:01:50.850> yes<00:01:51.149> if<00:01:51.329> you<00:01:51.450> it<00:01:51.689> might<00:01:52.110> disappear

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
part is yes if you it might disappear

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.160 
part is yes if you it might disappear
every<00:01:53.460> now<00:01:53.610> and<00:01:53.820> then<00:01:53.939> so<00:01:54.540> you're<00:01:54.750> gonna<00:01:54.930> need

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
every now and then so you're gonna need

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.450 
every now and then so you're gonna need
a<00:01:55.229> couple<00:01:55.560> of<00:01:55.680> the<00:01:55.829> items<00:01:55.979> so<00:01:56.189> if<00:01:56.280> you're<00:01:56.399> doing

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
a couple of the items so if you're doing

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.039 
a couple of the items so if you're doing
this<00:01:56.610> with<00:01:56.729> diamond<00:01:57.329> you<00:01:57.479> might<00:01:57.719> want<00:01:57.930> to<00:01:57.960> be

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
this with diamond you might want to be

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.530 
this with diamond you might want to be
kind<00:01:58.170> of<00:01:58.259> careful<00:01:58.409> if<00:01:58.649> you<00:01:58.740> only<00:01:58.890> have<00:01:59.100> one<00:01:59.540> but

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
kind of careful if you only have one but

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.340 
kind of careful if you only have one but
I<00:02:01.579> have<00:02:02.579> multiple<00:02:03.299> blocks<00:02:03.570> of<00:02:03.780> iron<00:02:03.930> from

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
I have multiple blocks of iron from

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.969 
I have multiple blocks of iron from
mining<00:02:05.280> and<00:02:05.540> duplicating<00:02:06.540> of<00:02:06.689> course<00:02:06.930> so<00:02:07.680> for

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
mining and duplicating of course so for

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.529 
mining and duplicating of course so for
me<00:02:08.129> it's<00:02:08.310> fine<00:02:08.640> that<00:02:08.879> they<00:02:09.000> disappear<00:02:09.420> every

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
me it's fine that they disappear every

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:10.470 
me it's fine that they disappear every
now<00:02:09.660> and<00:02:09.840> then

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:10.480 
now and then

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:12.790 
now and then
all<00:02:11.480> right<00:02:11.599> so<00:02:11.780> there<00:02:11.900> you<00:02:11.989> go<00:02:12.110> see<00:02:12.349> you<00:02:12.440> see<00:02:12.590> -

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 
all right so there you go see you see -

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.350 
all right so there you go see you see -
now<00:02:13.190> if<00:02:13.430> you're<00:02:13.580> gonna<00:02:13.700> invert<00:02:13.910> or<00:02:14.090> you<00:02:14.180> should

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
now if you're gonna invert or you should

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:15.610 
now if you're gonna invert or you should
just<00:02:14.540> have<00:02:14.660> the<00:02:14.780> same<00:02:14.959> block<00:02:15.170> of<00:02:15.200> iron<00:02:15.410> but

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
just have the same block of iron but

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.770 
just have the same block of iron but
when<00:02:15.709> you<00:02:15.800> pick<00:02:15.980> it<00:02:16.010> up<00:02:16.190> it'll<00:02:16.970> get<00:02:17.090> a<00:02:17.270> stack

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
when you pick it up it'll get a stack

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.290 
when you pick it up it'll get a stack
that<00:02:18.080> of<00:02:18.590> 64<00:02:19.340> when<00:02:19.489> your<00:02:19.610> inventory<00:02:20.030> it<00:02:20.150> look

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:20.300 
that of 64 when your inventory it look

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.059 
that of 64 when your inventory it look
like<00:02:20.420> 64<00:02:20.930> now<00:02:21.530> the<00:02:21.620> normal<00:02:21.920> way<00:02:22.040> of

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:22.069 
like 64 now the normal way of

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:25.900 
like 64 now the normal way of
duplicating<00:02:22.450> you<00:02:23.450> take<00:02:23.720> it<00:02:23.870> over<00:02:24.140> into<00:02:24.349> a<00:02:24.950> an

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
duplicating you take it over into a an

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:27.699 
duplicating you take it over into a an
empty<00:02:26.180> inventory<00:02:26.540> space<00:02:26.750> I<00:02:27.019> perform<00:02:27.590> the

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:27.709 
empty inventory space I perform the

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:30.729 
empty inventory space I perform the
bottom<00:02:27.980> and<00:02:28.180> you<00:02:29.180> just<00:02:29.569> hold<00:02:29.840> X<00:02:30.110> and<00:02:30.410> it<00:02:30.590> keeps

00:02:30.729 --> 00:02:30.739 
bottom and you just hold X and it keeps

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:33.100 
bottom and you just hold X and it keeps
placing<00:02:31.280> one<00:02:31.489> and<00:02:31.730> now<00:02:32.450> what<00:02:32.569> this<00:02:32.690> does<00:02:32.930> is<00:02:33.019> it

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 
placing one and now what this does is it

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:34.750 
placing one and now what this does is it
places<00:02:33.319> the<00:02:33.590> blocks<00:02:33.830> one<00:02:34.040> by<00:02:34.220> one<00:02:34.459> but<00:02:34.670> when

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
places the blocks one by one but when

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.309 
places the blocks one by one but when
you<00:02:34.849> get<00:02:34.970> to<00:02:35.030> one<00:02:35.330> it<00:02:35.540> pops<00:02:35.750> back<00:02:35.840> up<00:02:36.080> and<00:02:36.260> you

00:02:36.309 --> 00:02:36.319 
you get to one it pops back up and you

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:38.410 
you get to one it pops back up and you
have<00:02:36.410> 64<00:02:36.860> again<00:02:37.130> now<00:02:37.790> that's<00:02:38.030> how<00:02:38.180> most<00:02:38.360> people

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
have 64 again now that's how most people

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.420 
have 64 again now that's how most people
duplicate<00:02:38.959> and<00:02:39.200> for<00:02:39.650> most<00:02:39.769> people<00:02:40.040> they<00:02:40.190> just

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
duplicate and for most people they just

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:42.430 
duplicate and for most people they just
keep<00:02:40.670> placing<00:02:41.390> more<00:02:41.750> and<00:02:41.870> more<00:02:42.019> blocks<00:02:42.260> but

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
keep placing more and more blocks but

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:43.840 
keep placing more and more blocks but
that<00:02:42.530> just<00:02:42.620> takes<00:02:42.769> up<00:02:42.950> inventory<00:02:43.160> space<00:02:43.610> is

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:43.850 
that just takes up inventory space is

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:47.020 
that just takes up inventory space is
quite<00:02:44.209> inconvenient<00:02:44.720> in<00:02:44.930> my<00:02:45.019> opinion<00:02:45.440> so<00:02:46.130> we

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
quite inconvenient in my opinion so we

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:48.789 
quite inconvenient in my opinion so we
also<00:02:47.180> notice<00:02:47.480> when<00:02:47.690> you're<00:02:47.840> not<00:02:48.440> in<00:02:48.680> your

00:02:48.789 --> 00:02:48.799 
also notice when you're not in your

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:50.890 
also notice when you're not in your
inventory<00:02:49.069> it<00:02:49.730> looks<00:02:49.880> like<00:02:49.970> there's<00:02:50.120> only<00:02:50.239> one

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
inventory it looks like there's only one

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:52.809 
inventory it looks like there's only one
right<00:02:51.110> here<00:02:51.350> but<00:02:52.310> when<00:02:52.549> you<00:02:52.610> go<00:02:52.700> in<00:02:52.790> here

00:02:52.809 --> 00:02:52.819 
right here but when you go in here

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:54.880 
right here but when you go in here
they're<00:02:53.150> 64<00:02:53.720> so<00:02:54.230> what<00:02:54.319> you're<00:02:54.410> gonna<00:02:54.470> do<00:02:54.709> is

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:54.890 
they're 64 so what you're gonna do is

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:56.050 
they're 64 so what you're gonna do is
you're<00:02:55.010> gonna<00:02:55.069> go<00:02:55.280> to<00:02:55.340> that<00:02:55.459> stack<00:02:55.790> that<00:02:56.000> I

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
you're gonna go to that stack that I

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.080 
you're gonna go to that stack that I
just<00:02:56.360> had<00:02:56.480> you<00:02:56.630> make<00:02:56.810> over<00:02:57.680> here<00:02:58.040> the<00:02:58.640> non

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.090 
just had you make over here the non

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:00.520 
just had you make over here the non
duplicate<00:02:59.630> of<00:02:59.720> the<00:02:59.870> one<00:03:00.019> that<00:03:00.140> you<00:03:00.230> just<00:03:00.380> made

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.530 
duplicate of the one that you just made

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:02.740 
duplicate of the one that you just made
it<00:03:00.650> with<00:03:00.739> the<00:03:00.799> duplication<00:03:01.330> that<00:03:02.330> still<00:03:02.569> looks

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 
it with the duplication that still looks

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:04.449 
it with the duplication that still looks
like<00:03:02.780> 64<00:03:03.349> when<00:03:03.470> you're<00:03:03.590> there<00:03:03.739> you're<00:03:04.310> gonna

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:04.459 
like 64 when you're there you're gonna

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:05.830 
like 64 when you're there you're gonna
throw<00:03:04.670> like<00:03:04.790> maybe<00:03:05.060> five<00:03:05.360> on<00:03:05.540> the<00:03:05.599> ground

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840 
throw like maybe five on the ground

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:07.720 
throw like maybe five on the ground
fanuc<00:03:06.200> does<00:03:06.380> no<00:03:06.470> matter<00:03:06.590> how<00:03:06.920> much<00:03:07.099> is<00:03:07.310> not<00:03:07.459> too

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
fanuc does no matter how much is not too

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:09.910 
fanuc does no matter how much is not too
much<00:03:07.940> walk<00:03:08.780> over<00:03:09.110> it<00:03:09.170> and<00:03:09.349> now<00:03:09.560> you'll<00:03:09.739> have<00:03:09.860> a

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:09.920 
much walk over it and now you'll have a

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:13.089 
much walk over it and now you'll have a
stack<00:03:10.160> of<00:03:10.269> 197<00:03:11.620> but<00:03:12.620> when<00:03:12.739> you<00:03:12.830> go<00:03:12.950> in<00:03:13.040> here

00:03:13.089 --> 00:03:13.099 
stack of 197 but when you go in here

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:14.740 
stack of 197 but when you go in here
it's<00:03:13.489> just<00:03:13.610> how<00:03:13.819> it<00:03:14.030> look<00:03:14.180> like<00:03:14.359> however<00:03:14.570> many

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750 
it's just how it look like however many

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:17.050 
it's just how it look like however many
you<00:03:14.959> threw<00:03:15.230> down<00:03:15.260> so<00:03:15.829> I<00:03:15.859> threw<00:03:16.040> down<00:03:16.070> five<00:03:16.400> but

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060 
you threw down so I threw down five but

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:19.750 
you threw down so I threw down five but
I<00:03:17.150> have<00:03:17.299> a<00:03:17.329> sack<00:03:17.540> of<00:03:17.630> 197<00:03:18.290> now<00:03:19.040> it's<00:03:19.519> kind<00:03:19.730> of

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:19.760 
I have a sack of 197 now it's kind of

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:20.830 
I have a sack of 197 now it's kind of
hard<00:03:19.820> to<00:03:19.970> show<00:03:20.060> you<00:03:20.180> right<00:03:20.390> now<00:03:20.570> because

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:20.840 
hard to show you right now because

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:22.120 
hard to show you right now because
there's<00:03:21.440> a<00:03:21.500> one<00:03:21.590> hundred<00:03:21.799> ninety<00:03:22.010> seven

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:22.130 
there's a one hundred ninety seven

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:24.220 
there's a one hundred ninety seven
blocks<00:03:22.370> I'd<00:03:22.609> have<00:03:22.760> to<00:03:22.850> place<00:03:23.060> but<00:03:23.959> basically

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:24.230 
blocks I'd have to place but basically

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:28.599 
blocks I'd have to place but basically
what<00:03:24.440> would<00:03:24.530> happen<00:03:24.859> is<00:03:25.299> eventually<00:03:27.549> if<00:03:28.549> you

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:28.609 
what would happen is eventually if you

00:03:28.609 --> 00:03:31.210 
what would happen is eventually if you
finish<00:03:29.180> the<00:03:29.510> 197<00:03:30.470> off<00:03:30.590> and<00:03:30.769> you're<00:03:30.859> like<00:03:30.890> down

00:03:33.039 --> 00:03:33.049 
to two or whatever if you place those

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:36.130 
to two or whatever if you place those
two<00:03:33.290> it'll<00:03:33.590> pop<00:03:33.769> right<00:03:33.890> back<00:03:34.069> up<00:03:34.250> into<00:03:34.579> 255<00:03:35.569> as

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:36.140 
two it'll pop right back up into 255 as

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:37.690 
two it'll pop right back up into 255 as
you<00:03:36.319> would<00:03:36.410> have<00:03:36.500> a<00:03:36.530> stack<00:03:36.739> of<00:03:36.769> 255<00:03:37.489> right

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:37.700

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:39.940 
you would have a stack of 255 right
there<00:03:37.880> and<00:03:38.030> that<00:03:38.989> stack<00:03:39.380> will<00:03:39.560> never<00:03:39.739> run<00:03:39.920> out

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:39.950 
there and that stack will never run out

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:42.849 
there and that stack will never run out
