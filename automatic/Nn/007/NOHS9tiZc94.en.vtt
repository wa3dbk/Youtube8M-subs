recall in their history not just history
I'm<00:05:56.910> talking<00:05:57.210> about<00:05:57.270> the<00:05:57.480> past<00:05:57.720> ten<00:05:57.990> years

00:05:58.010 --> 00:05:58.020 
I'm talking about the past ten years

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:00.350 
I'm talking about the past ten years
because<00:05:58.530> obviously<00:05:58.770> in<00:05:59.280> the<00:05:59.760> history<00:06:00.180> they

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:00.360 
because obviously in the history they

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:02.360 
because obviously in the history they
have<00:06:00.480> had<00:06:00.750> a<00:06:00.780> couple<00:06:01.020> you<00:06:01.650> know<00:06:01.680> superstars

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:02.370 
have had a couple you know superstars

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:04.160 
have had a couple you know superstars
come<00:06:02.670> through<00:06:02.940> but<00:06:03.360> I'm<00:06:03.510> talking<00:06:03.870> about<00:06:03.930> in

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:04.170 
come through but I'm talking about in

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:06.200

the<00:06:04.260> last<00:06:04.290> ten<00:06:04.830> years<00:06:04.860> so<00:06:05.370> it<00:06:05.490> might<00:06:05.640> be<00:06:05.700> a<00:06:05.850> good

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:06.210 
the last ten years so it might be a good

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:09.560 
the last ten years so it might be a good
idea<00:06:06.420> if<00:06:06.960> we<00:06:07.020> do<00:06:07.770> bring<00:06:08.130> in<00:06:08.400> a<00:06:08.610> superstar<00:06:09.330> and
