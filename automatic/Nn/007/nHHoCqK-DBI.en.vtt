00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:05.680 
so at this point I'm going to pause it
again<00:04:04.820> and<00:04:04.940> I'm<00:04:05.000> going<00:04:05.120> to<00:04:05.209> show<00:04:05.360> you<00:04:05.390> how<00:04:05.630> the

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:05.690 
again and I'm going to show you how the

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:09.759 
again and I'm going to show you how the
external<00:04:06.760> charging<00:04:07.760> device<00:04:08.000> hooks<00:04:08.269> up<00:04:08.769> okay

00:04:09.759 --> 00:04:09.769 
external charging device hooks up okay

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:13.630 
external charging device hooks up okay
right<00:04:10.040> now<00:04:10.190> I<00:04:10.220> have<00:04:10.459> connected<00:04:12.040> 6<00:04:13.040> volt<00:04:13.310> source

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:13.640 
right now I have connected 6 volt source

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:19.330 
right now I have connected 6 volt source
from<00:04:14.000> another<00:04:16.030> battery<00:04:17.030> that<00:04:17.239> I'm<00:04:17.329> using<00:04:18.340> to

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:19.340 
from another battery that I'm using to

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:22.659 
from another battery that I'm using to
the<00:04:19.489> charger<00:04:19.880> unit<00:04:20.060> and<00:04:20.799> that<00:04:21.799> is<00:04:22.190> the<00:04:22.340> voltage

00:04:22.659 --> 00:04:22.669 
the charger unit and that is the voltage

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:23.830 
the charger unit and that is the voltage
reading<00:04:22.880> with<00:04:23.510> the

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:23.840 
reading with the

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:26.290 
reading with the
six<00:04:24.080> volts<00:04:24.470> I'm<00:04:24.770> going<00:04:25.070> into<00:04:25.340> it<00:04:25.490> so<00:04:26.090> as<00:04:26.210> you

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:26.300 
six volts I'm going into it so as you

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:28.240 
six volts I'm going into it so as you
can<00:04:26.389> see<00:04:26.449> it's<00:04:26.660> a<00:04:26.750> bit<00:04:26.960> higher<00:04:27.220> which<00:04:28.220> means

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:28.250 
can see it's a bit higher which means

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:30.270 
can see it's a bit higher which means
it's<00:04:28.669> probably<00:04:28.850> going<00:04:29.270> to<00:04:29.360> charge<00:04:29.630> the

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:30.280 
it's probably going to charge the

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:33.969 
it's probably going to charge the
batteries<00:04:31.280> quite<00:04:31.610> a<00:04:31.639> bit<00:04:31.850> faster<00:04:32.979> remember

00:04:33.969 --> 00:04:33.979 
batteries quite a bit faster remember

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:35.680 
batteries quite a bit faster remember
that<00:04:34.160> the<00:04:34.280> unit<00:04:34.580> does<00:04:34.699> not<00:04:34.729> have<00:04:34.910> a<00:04:35.090> load<00:04:35.360> on<00:04:35.570> it

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:35.690 
that the unit does not have a load on it

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:38.439 
that the unit does not have a load on it
right<00:04:35.870> now<00:04:35.900> so<00:04:36.520> you're<00:04:37.520> getting<00:04:37.850> a<00:04:37.970> no<00:04:38.150> load

00:04:38.439 --> 00:04:38.449 
right now so you're getting a no load

00:04:38.449 --> 00:04:40.990 
right now so you're getting a no load
indication<00:04:39.199> on<00:04:39.380> this<00:04:39.590> voltmeter<00:04:39.889> so<00:04:40.610> overall

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:41.000 
indication on this voltmeter so overall

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000 
indication on this voltmeter so overall
I<00:04:41.030> think<00:04:41.270> the<00:04:41.570> unit<00:04:41.840> probably<00:04:42.320> is<00:04:42.440> functional

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:43.010 
I think the unit probably is functional

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:44.950 
I think the unit probably is functional
although<00:04:43.940> it<00:04:44.060> will<00:04:44.150> take<00:04:44.210> some<00:04:44.660> time<00:04:44.690> to

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:44.960 
although it will take some time to

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:48.189 
although it will take some time to
charge<00:04:45.320> your<00:04:45.470> batteries<00:04:45.860> and<00:04:46.750> so<00:04:47.750> it<00:04:48.050> would<00:04:48.169> be

00:04:48.189 --> 00:04:48.199 
charge your batteries and so it would be

00:04:48.199 --> 00:04:50.170 
charge your batteries and so it would be
ideal<00:04:48.410> for<00:04:48.770> an<00:04:48.830> emergency<00:04:49.250> and<00:04:49.669> also<00:04:50.030> if<00:04:50.090> you

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:50.180 
ideal for an emergency and also if you

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:52.330 
ideal for an emergency and also if you
have<00:04:50.300> an<00:04:50.389> external<00:04:50.690> pack<00:04:51.050> you<00:04:51.380> know<00:04:51.500> similar

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:52.340 
have an external pack you know similar

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:54.310 
have an external pack you know similar
to<00:04:52.460> what<00:04:52.639> I've<00:04:52.760> done<00:04:52.970> here<00:04:53.330> and<00:04:53.389> connected<00:04:54.290> to

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:54.320 
to what I've done here and connected to

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:57.990 
to what I've done here and connected to
a<00:04:54.410> car<00:04:54.680> battery<00:04:55.160> you<00:04:55.370> could<00:04:56.240> use<00:04:56.389> it<00:04:56.540> that<00:04:56.750> way

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:58.000 
a car battery you could use it that way

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.219 
a car battery you could use it that way
this<00:04:59.000> device<00:04:59.360> that<00:04:59.389> you<00:04:59.660> see<00:04:59.690> down<00:04:59.930> here<00:04:59.990> is

00:05:00.219 --> 00:05:00.229 
this device that you see down here is

00:05:00.229 --> 00:05:01.780 
this device that you see down here is
connected<00:05:00.590> to<00:05:00.650> the<00:05:00.860> battery<00:05:01.010> and<00:05:01.430> it's<00:05:01.550> got

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:01.790 
connected to the battery and it's got

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:03.490 
connected to the battery and it's got
several<00:05:02.270> outputs<00:05:02.720> and<00:05:02.930> I'm<00:05:02.990> just<00:05:03.110> using<00:05:03.320> the

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:03.500 
several outputs and I'm just using the

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:05.620 
several outputs and I'm just using the
six<00:05:03.740> volt<00:05:03.979> to<00:05:04.220> power<00:05:04.700> the<00:05:04.880> charger<00:05:05.270> right<00:05:05.450> now

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:05.630 
six volt to power the charger right now

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:07.719 
six volt to power the charger right now
so<00:05:06.110> in<00:05:06.229> an<00:05:06.320> emergency<00:05:06.560> this<00:05:07.100> probably<00:05:07.490> would

00:05:07.719 --> 00:05:07.729 
so in an emergency this probably would

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:09.250 
so in an emergency this probably would
be<00:05:07.880> a<00:05:07.910> good<00:05:08.060> little<00:05:08.240> unit<00:05:08.360> to<00:05:08.660> have<00:05:08.810> around<00:05:09.050> to

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:09.260 
be a good little unit to have around to

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.200 
be a good little unit to have around to
charge<00:05:09.530> your<00:05:09.710> batteries<00:05:10.160> so<00:05:10.850> I<00:05:10.910> have<00:05:11.030> a<00:05:11.060> good

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:11.210 
charge your batteries so I have a good

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:14.290 
charge your batteries so I have a good
day<00:05:11.330> and<00:05:11.450> I<00:05:11.510> hope<00:05:11.540> you<00:05:11.810> enjoyed<00:05:12.020> the<00:05:12.200> video
