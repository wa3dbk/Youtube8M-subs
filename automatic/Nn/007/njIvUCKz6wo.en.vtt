 rim rides through the building almost flies on 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:31.170

 earth and seemingly it can break 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.090
 but look he lands right on 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.660
 wheels but however the side does not give him 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.510
 stand 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.160
 place number seven bet on quad

 a hill to use about as a springboard 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.090
 he jumps over flies on a billboard and 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:09.890

 regular stunt on his pale green 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.790
 motorcycle taking off doing an epic flip 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.340
 but tries to jump off him and hits 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:23.070
 head straight on the table 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:24.900
 the most average place a guy with full 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.390
 equipment for tricks on his 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:30.210
 crazy motorcycle accelerates on 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.490
 huge road he bounces off the car 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.150
 from the palm tree flies on the building but he does not 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.009
 just a few centimeters 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:39.240
 fourth place 

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:41.720
 slowdown time for the greatest 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.790
 acceleration and the guy bounces off the side 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:48.010
 rushes straight to the building opposite 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:51.820
 oh god what a long flight but he hits 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:55.000
 Over the side of the flies straight down drove 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:57.220
 three of the best from these places with 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.650
 using a huge number of boosters and 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:02.080
 time dilation the guy bounces off 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:04.300
 the side flies over the bridge and is about to 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:07.480
 for flying straight to the parking lot it 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:11.230
 comes out but he hits the wall second 

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:12.850
 place and again we have a super speed bike 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.310
 epic acceleration and attempt to fly into 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:19.660
 building but unfortunately the speed was 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:23.260
 too high and finally that place number 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:25.510
 1 and here again motorcycles and again 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:28.450
 boosters and of course the epic long 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:30.460
 road for drop dead guy 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:33.250
 rides at tremendous speed bounces off 

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:35.980
 rim and just incredibly long flies 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:37.600
 in the air bounce off the building flies 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:37.990
 will he be able to do this later 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:41.290
 trick 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:42.580
 incredible backflip but the building prevented 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:45.280
 he do the trick 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:47.830
