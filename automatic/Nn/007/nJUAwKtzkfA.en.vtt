 fifa 16 and as we talk now 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.870
 on some very strong points that I 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.300
 I have analyzed that the running part of itself 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.430
 that some good plays and trios today one 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.970
 only then new rails will speak 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:26.460
 on defensive part and more players 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:29.070
 smart but I'm happy 2010 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.390
 for you that ronaldinho is finding 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.700
 fifa 16 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.370
 So if you want to win for free at 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.320

 in the link is appearing next to 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.960
 find out how to participate stop 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.969
 inflation as steam that today we are going 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.489
 talk about defensive part 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:50.489
 Let's talk about new videos. 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:53.969
 just a glance at this move 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:56.280
 this versus marcelo we see the 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:01:00.120
 people watch lionel messi running through 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:02.190
 side and the right end that 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.390
 happens on our side he is the 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:07.830
 marcelo 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:08.520
 they come to disarm a certain government of 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.340
 played 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.890
 he comes derangement player is the most 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.650
 interesting that I observed and has 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:19.140
 curves and control the algae the cart gives 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.659
 a look no sky gives a way that 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.909
 it looks like you control the cart in the 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.740
 move is approaching and you have the 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.869
 power to control 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.579
 It seems like the distance to when you 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:33.750
 safer example button if you are 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:35.640
 holding the book will be the ball but the 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.740
 independent claw lack focus on 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.140
 playstation 4 is now holding 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.060
 ball there to give a cart I think 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.680
 When are you going to hold a ball? 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:47.080
 in the cart I think it's going to be one more 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:48.940
 You guys, if you jump the ball more 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:50.440
 fast then a cart will be with 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:52.930
 more short distance 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:54.550
 so I found this balcony very important 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:57.490
 and I found it very interesting the way 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:59.560
 that you are once again the play 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:02.290
 since you control the cart you 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:05.200
 safe hold ball that the 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:07.420
 cart is just stretching of course that 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.520
 there is a certain distance where you go 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.920
 take this path so I thought it was cool 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:13.630
 next game is simply a 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.150
 design that I now speak of 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:17.739
 intelligence there are more players see 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.640
 sex I'm not with the ball and with 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:21.970
 benzema 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:24.310
 the little one as you you saw talking 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:27.010
 With all I'll tell you that the 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:29.590
 defensive part so he advances a 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:31.930
 step ahead of the attacker use it 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:33.340
 can do the same thing isaa 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:35.470
 This is it people take a look at the 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:38.920
 chicharito lineker ramos rodrigues 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:42.220
 receive the ball and rafting which is the means 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:44.170
 who plays in the middle and he went there gave 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:47.350
 cart was able to control the time 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:49.780
 from that cart collapsed the play already 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:50.560
 raised in return to follow the 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:51.910
 played 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.489
 Now we do not even talk about 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:57.610
 new dribles people give it a go 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:58.480
 in this new tribute that the end 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:00.489
 complemented 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:02.530
 I found it very interesting that in this 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:03.519
 How can you make that move? 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:05.410
 of body 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:08.650
 most of the players who play in the 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:10.930
 europe methods they use this dribble 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:13.900
 and I found it very interesting from the 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:15.760
 of this will bring dribble for what was 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.680
 16 See only 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.540
 once again he gives that move by 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.940
 body going to the right and into the 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:24.290
 It really cuts the left is one of the 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:26.840
 people who use a lot this is neymar 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:29.689
 o'neill the master helped me a lot. 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:30.469
 Most players always use this 

00:03:29.689 --> 00:03:32.120
 played 

00:03:30.469 --> 00:03:34.069
 I found this move interesting because 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:36.290
 You have to use it within the field. 

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:37.790
 when you have to make a move and 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:38.629
 to be able to dribble to get 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:40.459
 make a goal 

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:43.099
 I see the most beautiful game so this is good 

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:46.519
 cool interesting and cool 

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:48.230
 could place and fifa fifteen to leave 

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:50.299
 No way, you should not go 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:52.400
 the goal then they should put 

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:54.439
 I still have not seen but should 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:56.689
 put it I think it would look interesting 

00:03:54.439 --> 00:03:58.609
 I think the game that the game would be 

00:03:56.689 --> 00:04:00.980
 much nicer would look much better 

00:03:58.609 --> 00:04:02.840
 nice to play 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:06.650
 in addition to its new levels of wales 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:09.139
 also has improved dog tags 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:12.109
 has improved attackers take a look 

00:04:09.139 --> 00:04:15.319
 law that pt tried to get ours 

00:04:12.109 --> 00:04:17.720
 The star is 107 right. 

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:19.579
 and he could not because I was 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:21.709
 the smarter you will go you will have 

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:24.169
 that push the button that you will give 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:26.360
 that neighbor touch will clean jump to 

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:28.099
 exit played in the quarterback then it would be a 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:29.389
 balcony very good 

00:04:28.099 --> 00:04:32.510
 Now talking about what I said. 

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:34.220
 previously is about improved goalkeepers 

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:38.419
 look at that bid after the cross 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:40.010
 of the r 71 calves a very strong kick 

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:42.889
 and got it first 

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:43.639
 already fell to the ground I go I catch the pure 

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:46.610
 reflection 

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:48.740
 It was then we see people perceive a 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:50.900
 improvement may also be a 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:53.690
 shit of the goalkeeper can not be k kicked 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:55.310
 in the middle of the goal but really is was the 

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:58.030
 spectacular defense 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:05:01.220
 today pure reflex and went in a cross 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:02.520
 very accurate even without feeling that the 

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:05.310
 years for the month of March 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:06.509
 where the goalkeeper managed to make a beautiful 

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:08.699
 defense 

00:05:06.509 --> 00:05:10.830
 It was then this is a video that comes 

00:05:08.699 --> 00:05:13.039
