 but he played with his feet 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.260
 so that with this part of his body he transports those who hear him to a 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.480
 sectional world 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:40.340

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:28.690
 for years it took Tuni to learn to play guitar 

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:32.060
 and he had to do it alone because back then 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:33.400

 most valuable to support your whole family 

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:53.830
 with more than 100 arms due to a bad medication that they gave their mother 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:55.830
 while pregnant 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:59.680
 without those parts of his body he managed to make his arms the most 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:02.680
 important throughout his life 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.520

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:30.209
 the most important to me 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:32.629

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:10.379

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:14.579
