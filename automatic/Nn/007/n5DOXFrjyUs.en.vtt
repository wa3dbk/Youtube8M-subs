00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:16.330 
like I feel like more drawn frames but

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:18.060 
like I feel like more drawn frames but
there's<00:06:16.570> like<00:06:16.780> you<00:06:17.560> can<00:06:17.680> tell<00:06:17.889> they're

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:18.070 
there's like you can tell they're

without me it's less smooth yeah for
sure<00:06:22.810> and<00:06:23.610> I<00:06:24.610> think<00:06:24.789> that's<00:06:24.940> how<00:06:25.060> they<00:06:25.090> keep<00:06:25.389> it

00:06:25.529 --> 00:06:25.539 
sure and I think that's how they keep it

00:06:25.539 --> 00:06:28.440 
sure and I think that's how they keep it
within<00:06:25.690> budget<00:06:25.810> time<00:06:26.680> yes<00:06:27.580> it's<00:06:28.090> a<00:06:28.180> little

within budget time yes it's a little

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:29.850 
within budget time yes it's a little
