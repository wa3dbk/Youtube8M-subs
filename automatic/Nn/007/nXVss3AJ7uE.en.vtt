00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:36.400 
players flocked to the game because they

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:38.160

could try to figure out new ways of
advancing<00:03:38.800> the<00:03:38.920> ball<00:03:39.000> so<00:03:40.000> the<00:03:40.150> players

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:40.420 
advancing the ball so the players

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:44.820

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:32.100 
were typed up in 1891 they're perfectly

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:36.020 
were typed up in 1891 they're perfectly
legible<00:04:32.540> he<00:04:33.540> signed<00:04:33.900> them<00:04:34.110> later<00:04:34.430> and<00:04:35.430> headed

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:36.030 
legible he signed them later and headed

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:38.689 
legible he signed them later and headed
them<00:04:36.180> basketball<00:04:36.960> in<00:04:37.260> the<00:04:37.770> old-fashioned<00:04:38.580> way

00:04:38.689 --> 00:04:38.699 
them basketball in the old-fashioned way

00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:41.090 
them basketball in the old-fashioned way
of<00:04:38.729> writing<00:04:39.180> it<00:04:39.449> in<00:04:39.600> two<00:04:39.780> words<00:04:40.020> and<00:04:40.440> then<00:04:40.979> I

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:41.100 
of writing it in two words and then I

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:43.640 
of writing it in two words and then I
think<00:04:41.340> most<00:04:41.880> poignant<00:04:42.210> Lee<00:04:42.540> he's<00:04:43.169> added<00:04:43.530> at

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:43.650

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:46.100 
think most poignant Lee he's added at
the<00:04:43.800> end<00:04:43.979> first<00:04:44.910> draft<00:04:45.360> of<00:04:45.630> the<00:04:45.720> rules<00:04:45.930> of
