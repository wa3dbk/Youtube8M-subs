00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:05.790 

in<00:00:04.480> the<00:00:04.569> previous<00:00:04.930> video<00:00:05.080> I<00:00:05.290> talked<00:00:05.680> about

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:05.800 
in the previous video I talked about

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:07.620 
in the previous video I talked about
applying<00:00:06.310> dotted<00:00:06.730> rhythms<00:00:07.029> to<00:00:07.240> the<00:00:07.359> scales

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:07.630 
applying dotted rhythms to the scales

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:09.690 
applying dotted rhythms to the scales
that<00:00:07.750> you<00:00:07.870> are<00:00:08.080> practicing<00:00:08.460> another<00:00:09.460> way<00:00:09.670> I

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:09.700 
that you are practicing another way I

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:11.580 
that you are practicing another way I
like<00:00:09.969> to<00:00:10.120> practice<00:00:10.510> scales<00:00:10.750> is<00:00:11.050> by<00:00:11.320> playing

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:11.590 
like to practice scales is by playing

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:13.950 
like to practice scales is by playing
them<00:00:11.860> backwards<00:00:12.340> and<00:00:12.610> by<00:00:13.090> backwards<00:00:13.570> I<00:00:13.750> don't

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:13.960 
them backwards and by backwards I don't

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:15.780 
them backwards and by backwards I don't
mean<00:00:14.139> by<00:00:14.380> reversing<00:00:14.980> the<00:00:15.099> order<00:00:15.130> of<00:00:15.519> the<00:00:15.639> notes

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:15.790 
mean by reversing the order of the notes

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:17.850 
mean by reversing the order of the notes
you<00:00:16.059> keep<00:00:16.599> the<00:00:16.779> order<00:00:16.990> of<00:00:17.080> the<00:00:17.140> notes<00:00:17.290> as<00:00:17.560> is

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:17.860 
you keep the order of the notes as is

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:19.560 
you keep the order of the notes as is
but<00:00:18.430> instead<00:00:18.640> of<00:00:18.760> playing<00:00:19.029> the<00:00:19.210> scale<00:00:19.449> from

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:19.570 
but instead of playing the scale from

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:21.630 
but instead of playing the scale from
the<00:00:19.660> beginning<00:00:20.170> to<00:00:20.380> the<00:00:20.410> end<00:00:20.500> you<00:00:21.220> start<00:00:21.520> at

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:21.640 
the beginning to the end you start at

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:23.370 
the beginning to the end you start at
the<00:00:21.730> end<00:00:21.910> and<00:00:22.180> you<00:00:22.390> slowly<00:00:22.660> make<00:00:23.020> your<00:00:23.050> way<00:00:23.199> to

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:23.380 
the end and you slowly make your way to

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:25.769 
the end and you slowly make your way to
the<00:00:23.590> beginning<00:00:23.970> meaning<00:00:24.970> you<00:00:25.300> start<00:00:25.480> with<00:00:25.689> the

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:25.779 
the beginning meaning you start with the

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:27.810 
the beginning meaning you start with the
last<00:00:25.990> note<00:00:26.230> or<00:00:26.830> the<00:00:27.010> last<00:00:27.189> two<00:00:27.369> notes<00:00:27.519> let's

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:27.820 
last note or the last two notes let's

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:32.040 
last note or the last two notes let's
say<00:00:29.490> then<00:00:30.490> you<00:00:30.789> play<00:00:31.029> the<00:00:31.240> last<00:00:31.449> three<00:00:31.869> notes

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:32.050 
say then you play the last three notes

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:56.160 
say then you play the last three notes
of<00:00:32.169> the<00:00:32.290> scale<00:00:53.460> and<00:00:54.460> you<00:00:55.239> add<00:00:55.420> a<00:00:55.449> note<00:00:55.780> each

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:56.170 
of the scale and you add a note each

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:59.160 
of the scale and you add a note each
time<00:00:56.520> now<00:00:57.520> of<00:00:57.850> course<00:00:58.480> when<00:00:58.690> you're<00:00:58.809> actually

00:00:59.160 --> 00:00:59.170 
time now of course when you're actually

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:00.840 
time now of course when you're actually
practicing<00:00:59.350> you<00:00:59.829> would<00:00:59.980> do<00:01:00.160> each<00:01:00.430> one<00:01:00.670> of

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:00.850 
practicing you would do each one of

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:02.580 
practicing you would do each one of
those<00:01:01.030> more<00:01:01.629> than<00:01:01.660> once<00:01:02.050> so<00:01:02.199> you're<00:01:02.320> not<00:01:02.440> going

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:02.590 
those more than once so you're not going

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:04.560 
those more than once so you're not going
to<00:01:02.649> just<00:01:02.800> do<00:01:02.920> this<00:01:03.129> and<00:01:03.489> then<00:01:03.640> the<00:01:04.239> next<00:01:04.479> one

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:04.570 
to just do this and then the next one

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:07.880 
to just do this and then the next one
you<00:01:04.629> would<00:01:04.839> do<00:01:04.960> it<00:01:05.080> a<00:01:05.259> few<00:01:05.800> times

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
you would do it a few times

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.410 
you would do it a few times
the<00:01:08.890> last<00:01:09.100> two<00:01:09.280> notes<00:01:09.400> the<00:01:09.910> last<00:01:10.060> three<00:01:10.240> notes

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:10.420 
the last two notes the last three notes

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:15.300 
the last two notes the last three notes
a<00:01:10.600> few<00:01:10.630> times<00:01:13.560> and<00:01:14.560> so<00:01:14.770> on<00:01:14.890> so<00:01:15.070> you<00:01:15.160> actually

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:15.310 
a few times and so on so you actually

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:17.450 
a few times and so on so you actually
get<00:01:15.610> some<00:01:15.760> benefit<00:01:16.180> out<00:01:16.330> of<00:01:16.390> the<00:01:16.630> repetition

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
get some benefit out of the repetition

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.710 
get some benefit out of the repetition
when<00:01:18.460> you<00:01:18.580> practice<00:01:19.030> this<00:01:19.180> way<00:01:19.360> you<00:01:19.420> have<00:01:19.630> to

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:19.720 
when you practice this way you have to

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:21.540 
when you practice this way you have to
make<00:01:19.750> sure<00:01:20.080> that<00:01:20.350> you<00:01:20.710> have<00:01:20.890> written<00:01:21.070> every

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:21.550 
make sure that you have written every

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:23.730 
make sure that you have written every
single<00:01:21.940> right<00:01:22.120> hand<00:01:22.330> fingering<00:01:22.630> down<00:01:22.930> because

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:23.740 
single right hand fingering down because

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:25.560 
single right hand fingering down because
what<00:01:23.979> happens<00:01:24.280> is<00:01:24.460> that<00:01:24.490> when<00:01:25.180> we<00:01:25.270> play<00:01:25.450> the

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:25.570 
what happens is that when we play the

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:26.850 
what happens is that when we play the
scale<00:01:25.780> from<00:01:25.900> the<00:01:25.960> beginning<00:01:26.170> let's<00:01:26.590> say<00:01:26.710> we

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:26.860 
scale from the beginning let's say we

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:28.650 
scale from the beginning let's say we
know<00:01:27.010> that<00:01:27.220> we<00:01:27.369> start<00:01:27.610> on<00:01:27.729> I<00:01:27.940> and<00:01:28.510> if

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:28.660 
know that we start on I and if

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:30.510 
know that we start on I and if
everything<00:01:29.020> goes<00:01:29.140> well<00:01:29.200> all<00:01:29.920> the<00:01:30.160> fingers

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:30.520 
everything goes well all the fingers

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:32.490 
everything goes well all the fingers
well<00:01:30.700> in<00:01:30.880> the<00:01:30.970> right<00:01:31.150> notes<00:01:31.450> and<00:01:31.720> you<00:01:32.200> finish

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:32.500 
well in the right notes and you finish

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:33.930 
well in the right notes and you finish
the<00:01:32.619> scale<00:01:32.860> however<00:01:33.250> when<00:01:33.520> you're<00:01:33.670> playing

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:33.940 
the scale however when you're playing

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:35.969 
the scale however when you're playing
the<00:01:34.210> scale<00:01:34.450> from<00:01:34.600> the<00:01:34.840> middle<00:01:35.470> of<00:01:35.590> it<00:01:35.710> or<00:01:35.830> from

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:35.979 
the scale from the middle of it or from

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:38.670 
the scale from the middle of it or from
the<00:01:36.130> end<00:01:36.280> unless<00:01:36.670> you<00:01:37.450> know<00:01:37.960> the<00:01:38.140> fingering<00:01:38.530> by

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:38.680 
the end unless you know the fingering by

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:40.650 
the end unless you know the fingering by
heart<00:01:38.890> which<00:01:39.100> chances<00:01:39.520> are<00:01:39.640> you<00:01:39.759> don't<00:01:39.880> you

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:40.660 
heart which chances are you don't you

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:41.880 
heart which chances are you don't you
would<00:01:40.780> have<00:01:40.869> to<00:01:40.960> go<00:01:41.050> to<00:01:41.110> the<00:01:41.259> beginning<00:01:41.649> play

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:41.890 
would have to go to the beginning play

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:43.590 
would have to go to the beginning play
through<00:01:42.130> and<00:01:42.220> be<00:01:42.310> like<00:01:42.430> okay<00:01:42.820> this<00:01:42.850> note<00:01:43.300> is

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:43.600 
through and be like okay this note is

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.080 
through and be like okay this note is
this<00:01:43.840> finger<00:01:44.140> so<00:01:44.860> take<00:01:45.220> a<00:01:45.250> few<00:01:45.369> moments<00:01:45.910> just

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.090 
this finger so take a few moments just

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:48.389 
this finger so take a few moments just
write<00:01:46.600> down<00:01:46.780> all<00:01:47.140> the<00:01:47.290> fingerings<00:01:47.740> so<00:01:48.250> then

00:01:48.389 --> 00:01:48.399 
write down all the fingerings so then

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:49.920 
write down all the fingerings so then
you<00:01:48.520> know<00:01:48.670> that<00:01:48.700> the<00:01:49.060> last<00:01:49.210> note<00:01:49.509> of<00:01:49.540> the<00:01:49.720> scale

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:49.930 
you know that the last note of the scale

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:52.109 
you know that the last note of the scale
is<00:01:50.200> this<00:01:50.410> finger<00:01:50.770> the<00:01:51.070> the<00:01:51.430> penultimate<00:01:51.640> two

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:52.119 
is this finger the the penultimate two

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:54.120 
is this finger the the penultimate two
notes<00:01:52.300> etc<00:01:52.869> are<00:01:53.200> with<00:01:53.440> this<00:01:53.560> fingers<00:01:53.860> it<00:01:54.009> will

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:54.130 
notes etc are with this fingers it will

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:55.200 
notes etc are with this fingers it will
save<00:01:54.340> you<00:01:54.430> some<00:01:54.610> time<00:01:54.759> when<00:01:54.940> you're<00:01:55.060> actually

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:55.210 
save you some time when you're actually

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:58.080 
save you some time when you're actually
practicing<00:01:55.930> and<00:01:56.350> starting<00:01:57.160> the<00:01:57.250> scale<00:01:57.520> in<00:01:57.880> the

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:58.090 
practicing and starting the scale in the

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:00.090 
practicing and starting the scale in the
middle<00:01:58.330> and<00:01:58.509> adding<00:01:58.869> note<00:01:59.020> at<00:01:59.229> each<00:01:59.440> time<00:01:59.680> and

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:00.100 
middle and adding note at each time and

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:01.830

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:01.840

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 
it in four notes per beat is too hard at

it in four notes per beat is too hard at

subdivide<00:02:10.090> the<00:02:10.239> beats<00:02:10.420> so<00:02:10.630> that<00:02:10.780> you<00:02:10.899> have

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.110 
subdivide the beats so that you have

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:12.900 
subdivide the beats so that you have
notes<00:02:11.769> that<00:02:11.950> are<00:02:12.070> on<00:02:12.220> the<00:02:12.340> beat<00:02:12.489> and<00:02:12.640> notes

notes that are on the beat and notes

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
that are offbeat and you don't have to

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.380 
that are offbeat and you don't have to
worry<00:02:14.739> about<00:02:14.860> having<00:02:15.549> three<00:02:15.880> notes<00:02:16.060> that<00:02:16.209> are

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
worry about having three notes that are

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:19.020 
worry about having three notes that are
not<00:02:16.540> really<00:02:16.810> on<00:02:16.840> the<00:02:17.049> beat<00:02:17.580> what<00:02:18.580> happens<00:02:18.880> when

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
not really on the beat what happens when

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.449 
not really on the beat what happens when
you<00:02:19.150> practice<00:02:19.540> this<00:02:19.660> way<00:02:19.840> is<00:02:20.190> you<00:02:21.190> end<00:02:21.340> up

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:21.459 
you practice this way is you end up

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:23.789 
you practice this way is you end up
practicing<00:02:21.670> the<00:02:22.120> end<00:02:22.299> of<00:02:22.450> the<00:02:22.540> scale<00:02:22.840> as<00:02:23.049> much

00:02:23.789 --> 00:02:23.799 
practicing the end of the scale as much

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:25.410 
practicing the end of the scale as much
as<00:02:23.950> you<00:02:24.100> would<00:02:24.220> have<00:02:24.370> the<00:02:24.640> beginning<00:02:25.030> because

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
as you would have the beginning because

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.390 
as you would have the beginning because
we<00:02:25.720> start<00:02:25.959> from<00:02:26.080> the<00:02:26.200> beginning<00:02:26.290> it's<00:02:26.980> natural

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
we start from the beginning it's natural

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:28.530 
we start from the beginning it's natural
that<00:02:27.430> we'll<00:02:27.640> end<00:02:27.760> up<00:02:27.820> knowing<00:02:28.030> the<00:02:28.239> beginning

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
that we'll end up knowing the beginning

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.180 
that we'll end up knowing the beginning
of<00:02:28.630> the<00:02:28.720> scale<00:02:28.900> better<00:02:29.170> so<00:02:29.709> we<00:02:29.860> start<00:02:30.100> off

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
of the scale better so we start off

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:31.860 
of the scale better so we start off
really<00:02:30.370> confidently<00:02:30.940> and<00:02:31.239> then<00:02:31.420> by<00:02:31.600> the<00:02:31.660> end

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
really confidently and then by the end

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:33.720 
really confidently and then by the end
of<00:02:31.989> the<00:02:32.440> but<00:02:32.799> by<00:02:33.040> the<00:02:33.100> time<00:02:33.220> we<00:02:33.310> get<00:02:33.430> to<00:02:33.489> the<00:02:33.640> end

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
of the but by the time we get to the end

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:34.860 
of the but by the time we get to the end
of<00:02:33.790> the<00:02:33.910> scale<00:02:34.090> we<00:02:34.150> get<00:02:34.360> into<00:02:34.570> some<00:02:34.690> trouble

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
of the scale we get into some trouble

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:38.100 
of the scale we get into some trouble
this<00:02:35.620> way<00:02:35.860> you<00:02:35.920> eliminate<00:02:36.610> that<00:02:36.850> chance<00:02:37.810> of

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
this way you eliminate that chance of

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:39.840 
this way you eliminate that chance of
getting<00:02:38.590> into<00:02:38.709> some<00:02:39.160> trouble<00:02:39.310> by<00:02:39.579> the<00:02:39.640> time

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:39.850 
getting into some trouble by the time

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:42.120 
getting into some trouble by the time
you<00:02:39.970> end<00:02:40.150> the<00:02:40.239> scale<00:02:40.510> by<00:02:41.049> practicing<00:02:41.680> it<00:02:41.799> more

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.130 
you end the scale by practicing it more

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:44.370 
you end the scale by practicing it more
and<00:02:42.340> balancing<00:02:43.269> out<00:02:43.450> how<00:02:43.720> well<00:02:43.930> you<00:02:44.079> know<00:02:44.230> it

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:44.380 
and balancing out how well you know it

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:47.009 
and balancing out how well you know it
and<00:02:45.250> you<00:02:45.370> can<00:02:45.519> apply<00:02:45.730> this<00:02:45.850> technique<00:02:46.390> to

00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:47.019 
and you can apply this technique to

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:48.720 
and you can apply this technique to
anything<00:02:47.739> it<00:02:47.890> doesn't<00:02:48.130> have<00:02:48.220> to<00:02:48.340> be<00:02:48.459> scales

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
anything it doesn't have to be scales

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:51.090 
anything it doesn't have to be scales
you<00:02:48.910> can<00:02:48.940> apply<00:02:49.329> it<00:02:49.390> to<00:02:49.480> the<00:02:49.690> entire<00:02:49.810> piece<00:02:50.380> so

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.100 
you can apply it to the entire piece so

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:52.890 
you can apply it to the entire piece so
you<00:02:51.489> can<00:02:51.700> play<00:02:51.940> the<00:02:52.120> last<00:02:52.299> measure<00:02:52.540> of<00:02:52.660> the

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
you can play the last measure of the

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:54.780 
you can play the last measure of the
piece<00:02:53.079> then<00:02:53.680> the<00:02:53.860> last<00:02:54.010> two<00:02:54.250> measures<00:02:54.400> of<00:02:54.579> the

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
piece then the last two measures of the

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:56.670 
piece then the last two measures of the
piece<00:02:54.970> the<00:02:55.209> last<00:02:55.299> three<00:02:55.660> measures<00:02:55.959> obviously

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
piece the last three measures obviously

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.140 
piece the last three measures obviously
keeping<00:02:57.010> the<00:02:57.130> right<00:02:57.280> order<00:02:57.549> of<00:02:57.579> the<00:02:57.760> notes<00:02:57.850> and

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
keeping the right order of the notes and

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.120 
keeping the right order of the notes and
so<00:02:58.810> on<00:02:58.840> and<00:02:59.170> by<00:02:59.290> the<00:02:59.350> time<00:02:59.620> you<00:02:59.739> get<00:02:59.860> to<00:02:59.920> the

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130 
so on and by the time you get to the

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:02.009 
so on and by the time you get to the
very<00:03:00.340> beginning<00:03:00.760> of<00:03:00.850> the<00:03:00.970> piece<00:03:01.180> you<00:03:01.840> have

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:02.019 
very beginning of the piece you have

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:04.229 
very beginning of the piece you have
practiced<00:03:02.470> that<00:03:02.620> and<00:03:02.860> so<00:03:03.489> many<00:03:03.640> times<00:03:03.970> that

00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:04.239 
practiced that and so many times that

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:05.699 
practiced that and so many times that
you<00:03:04.360> know<00:03:04.540> it<00:03:04.660> just<00:03:04.690> as<00:03:04.989> well<00:03:05.049> as<00:03:05.260> you<00:03:05.470> do<00:03:05.590> at

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:05.709 
you know it just as well as you do at

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:07.740 
you know it just as well as you do at
the<00:03:05.799> beginning<00:03:05.920> because<00:03:06.760> often<00:03:07.120> times<00:03:07.360> we

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:07.750 
the beginning because often times we

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:08.970 
the beginning because often times we
know<00:03:08.019> the<00:03:08.140> beginning<00:03:08.440> of<00:03:08.530> the<00:03:08.620> piece<00:03:08.799> better

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:08.980 
know the beginning of the piece better

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:13.020 
know the beginning of the piece better
than<00:03:09.250> the<00:03:09.489> end<00:03:10.440> this<00:03:11.440> way<00:03:11.620> it's<00:03:12.280> all<00:03:12.519> balanced

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030 
than the end this way it's all balanced

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:14.580 
than the end this way it's all balanced
and<00:03:13.180> when<00:03:13.630> you<00:03:13.720> start<00:03:13.959> the<00:03:14.079> piece<00:03:14.260> you<00:03:14.440> don't

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
and when you start the piece you don't

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:15.990 
and when you start the piece you don't
have<00:03:14.709> to<00:03:14.829> worry<00:03:15.040> about<00:03:15.310> making<00:03:15.579> it<00:03:15.790> through

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 
have to worry about making it through

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.960 
have to worry about making it through
because<00:03:16.330> you<00:03:16.450> know<00:03:16.629> you<00:03:16.690> have

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:16.970 
because you know you have

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:19.180 
because you know you have
to<00:03:17.210> work<00:03:17.360> for<00:03:17.600> it<00:03:17.720> and<00:03:18.410> I<00:03:18.440> hope<00:03:18.590> this<00:03:18.770> helps<00:03:19.070> you
