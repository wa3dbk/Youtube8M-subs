you can see it gets quite expensive so
we'll<00:03:29.580> just<00:03:29.760> top<00:03:29.940> that<00:03:30.150> out<00:03:30.300> but<00:03:30.860> 70<00:03:31.860> layer

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
we'll just top that out but 70 layer

we'll just top that out but 70 layer
difference<00:03:32.580> will<00:03:32.760> learn<00:03:32.940> us<00:03:33.150> we<00:03:33.390> put<00:03:33.600> that

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
difference will learn us we put that

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:41.960 
difference will learn us we put that
over<00:03:34.050> 290<00:03:36.680> and<00:03:38.540> stick<00:03:39.540> checking<00:03:39.989> is<00:03:40.950> slow<00:03:41.310> at

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
over 290 and stick checking is slow at

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:44.539 
over 290 and stick checking is slow at
74<00:03:42.840> now<00:03:42.959> should<00:03:43.530> have<00:03:43.650> points<00:03:43.950> to<00:03:44.070> slow<00:03:44.310> back

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:44.549 
74 now should have points to slow back

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:47.309 
74 now should have points to slow back
at<00:03:44.790> that<00:03:44.970> and<00:03:45.209> then<00:03:45.420> for<00:03:45.720> shot-blocking<00:03:46.230> so<00:03:46.620> I

00:03:47.309 --> 00:03:47.319 
at that and then for shot-blocking so I

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:50.550 
at that and then for shot-blocking so I
and<00:03:47.499> I<00:03:47.620> will<00:03:47.859> go<00:03:47.980> back<00:03:48.010> to<00:03:48.400> sleep<00:03:49.090> checking<00:03:49.560> get

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 
and I will go back to sleep checking get

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.800 
and I will go back to sleep checking get
that<00:03:50.739> 278<00:03:51.459> and<00:03:51.790> then<00:03:51.939> just<00:03:52.120> put<00:03:52.329> the<00:03:52.450> rest<00:03:52.629> in
