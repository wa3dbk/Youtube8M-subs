00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:04.780
 what is going on people i welcome you 

00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:06.910
 to another edition of hensel 

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:08.440
 update should be some at the beginning in the eight 

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:11.769
 weeks until I get to the topics 

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:13.269
 So this was a special Thursday night 

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:14.650
 I as messed up but of course 

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:17.349
 the trade is currently not as in 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:18.609
 Start the update I would go with the with 

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:21.039
 the Persian vita or I start 

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:24.189
 I think so exactly right and that with 

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:26.710
 10 ran cappuccino how it was a pretty 

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:27.220
 new game is sold to 90 through 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:29.499
 been 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:31.749
 So that 's just warned in the west 

00:00:29.499 --> 00:00:34.120
 been 94,000 times, it was sold to 

00:00:31.749 --> 00:00:36.640
 26,000 are joining the 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:37.930
 digital versions are also subject to interest 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:39.609
 phantasy star online it I think has 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:41.739
 including a last week when I am 

00:00:39.609 --> 00:00:44.440
 I remember right to 89 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:46.480
 percent sold by and we have 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:49.420
 This sale would start from 90 percent 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:51.670
 a game is considered sold out because then 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:53.079
 yes the buyer so of course we then 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:54.280
 have to search more intensively to get one more 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:56.350
 get copy as it is not 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.280
 more as I said from the whole the 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:59.409
 was produced 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:02.079
 ten more are available in the trade 

00:00:59.409 --> 00:01:05.920
 that's why 90 percent came into play 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:09.160
 sold out and right now we want 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:10.900
 still the 95 percent think it is 

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:13.510
 I even went through Japan at that time 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:15.160
 been sold and he can get one of them 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:16.930
 go out that if you produce more 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:18.970
 would have offered more for sale 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:20.260
 who would have been sold for more because 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:22.750
 then of course you find yourself easier 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:25.570
 if I do so it never as 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:28.270
 for example, for us black 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:30.310
 just such a new example as wild 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:31.990
 We have to play and we have to play media market 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:34.570
 because after work only to the video 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:36.160
 market is no longer so since it would 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:38.260
 maybe the media market is not in 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:40.630
 munich but in augsburg saw it completely 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:42.700
 I just do not have a bad name 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:44.710
 to go to Augsburg and so 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:45.660
 I want something online 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:48.430
 are which shops 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:49.450
 Of course, now , of course, there is only one edition 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:51.070
 would have given me pretty much 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:53.470
 mediamarkt people bought up so late 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:55.450
 So sold and it just would not be that way 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:57.700
 a lot has been sold in total 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:59.620
 of course more but as I said that 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:02.380
 shortens we pay are yet 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:04.690
 just as firmly theme number two a dlc 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:06.880
 so far several dlcs are for one piece 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:09.880
 Pirate Bays 2 has been announced and 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:12.430
 Although at the Japanese magazins zapp are 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:13.000
 now new has been counted or was 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:15.070
 known to him 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.080
 just that of the dlc will give to 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:18.760
 example it becomes that the costume for 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:21.580
 Give a drill hankook or a long one 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:23.500
 yuan you costume for peru date for the 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:25.570
 whole dlcs or for the individual 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:28.000
 there are not any contents so you know 

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:31.270
 The whole risked also gave it new 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.040
 trailer and what to know is in the summer 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:35.980
 the game will be on playstation 3 in 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:38.880
 europe release and in japan on the 20th 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:41.080
 so it is also in the end there 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.940
 exactly and the wifi version is still 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:44.560
 not announced investors would be if 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:45.760
 also a beta version to get it is 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.870
 not known and of it you can 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.600
 currently do not spend 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:54.790
 theme number three in sprint 3ds too 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:57.550
 thank you thank you thank you thank you country 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:59.380
 returns 3d a few weeks ago that became 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:02.080
 year, surprisingly , I have to say 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:03.870
 could not assume that 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:06.670
 Game announced so a 3d remake 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:08.650
 but not from the original developers 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:10.959
 because at the moment the title for the 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:12.940
 video work but monster games 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:14.500
 the stop not only with 3d graphics 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:16.600
 install but also new features 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.920
 which are planned in the area are two 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.390
 leave the mouse here because I believe 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.670
 The simpsons does not want any sensors 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:23.260
 exactly as I said just now 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:24.910
 also in the film of 3ds will be revised 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.709
 he has the graphics and new features and 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:29.739
 just not from the developer of the original 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:31.180
 although still four by monster.ch 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:35.080
 internal 3ds namely devil survivor 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:38.560
 overclocked I picked out yesterday 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:40.360
 new release date fifth april she 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:43.269
 today, students have been moved to 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:44.950
 29 march across Europe is not valid for 

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:46.810
 We have the penultimate two before us 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:48.519
 weeks already explained that it is difficult 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:51.130
 is the whole drive with us 

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:51.880
 and that is why flash banal has in the 

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:54.040
 taken over 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:55.630
 and they say that we are on the 14th 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:57.880
 april come out that should be synonymous 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:59.860
 to have a final date that has become 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:01.930
 So the change in the fourth april with the 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:02.739
 survivor overclocked here in the trade at 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:04.480
 be available to us 

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:06.850
 like on the last topic again 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:09.730
 project shield was two days ago 

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:11.140
 Richie P2 is also presented 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:13.630

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:14.950
 effects and all those things 

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:16.419

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:17.829

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:22.000
 look where it serves me built in front of it 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:23.870

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000
 So now is not my job 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:27.620
 that's why and yes, a visual change 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.570
 but also of game content as new 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:31.600

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:34.310
