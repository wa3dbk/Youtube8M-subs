but I honestly think that's a really
great<00:02:30.950> idea<00:02:31.189> it'll<00:02:31.670> give<00:02:31.849> more<00:02:32.090> incentive<00:02:32.390> for

00:02:32.619 --> 00:02:32.629 
great idea it'll give more incentive for

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:34.420 
great idea it'll give more incentive for

in<00:05:21.440> grey<00:05:21.650> that<00:05:22.010> way<00:05:22.130> you<00:05:22.190> can<00:05:22.400> tell<00:05:22.580> whether<00:05:23.240> or

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:23.360

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:27.020 
you need to switch districts so I think

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:28.570 
you need to switch districts so I think
all<00:05:27.410> of<00:05:27.440> these<00:05:27.680> have<00:05:27.889> been<00:05:27.919> great<00:05:28.280> little
