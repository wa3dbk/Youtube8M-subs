00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:17.960
 hello little friends to facilitate today we are going to 

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:20.119
 see another link lucero this time is what 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:22.880
 I call quick getaway I like 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:24.680
 call it that because it's a link to 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:28.400
 leave a phrase that you want slower 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:29.930
 or I use it there and usually see more or 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:33.700
 less so in this way with the 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:33.700
 finger 3 on the after slope 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:37.590
 what is to get here 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:43.570
 and now here we are going to touch the cave 

00:00:41.859 --> 00:00:47.000
 up is the way 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:50.700
 to touch it so that it comes out fast you have 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.750
 then they swept the first rope 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.750
 the fret 12 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.760
 Y 

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:04.910
 twelve attempts 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.910
 and then it's up top down 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.549
 that I already decided could be a book 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.810
 but let's continue a little more 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:24.260
 and now let's do the key to this 

00:01:20.569 --> 00:01:26.570
 here it goes down and we do 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:29.290
 fifteen 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:31.830
 It is anger 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:31.830
 yes 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:36.850
 reached twelve 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:43.860
 and we will see data 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.810
 two 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:55.440
 which also no longer surrounding with mint 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:55.440
 tonic 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:06.760
 and it will only end like this 12 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.960
 m 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:15.430
 or I also make it very meaningful at the end 

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:18.850
 is to put this 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:18.850
 at 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:25.730
 to finish giving it as a whole 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:35.470
 is 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:41.640
 what interest does it say if in the min 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:41.640
 and help will come in handy 

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:53.560
 then up down down up 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:03:00.640
 is the idea 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:03:02.990
 tine down up and now down 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:05.000
 and in this case I'm using the 

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:06.290
 little finger because it's more comfortable 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.170
 because he already changes position before 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:10.190
 I was like with your hand lying down and do 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:13.000
 give you a hand rent 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:13.000
 then it came better 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.260
 but nothing happens for doing it too 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:20.950
 with this even this whole position is 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.950
 can do so 

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:30.659
 it would be more or less the same 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:36.610
 Y 

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:48.989
 I hope it is you and that little by little 

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:50.939
 having more phrases and dropping in 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:53.310
 your improvisations and not from 

00:03:50.939 --> 00:03:55.319
 make them as it is, nothing happens 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:58.159
 current but you can always go 

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:58.159
 slowing down a bit 

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:06.000
 that we load after a bit its flavor 

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:08.880
 own also knows the taquan drop them 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:12.170
 and then a little bit to do yours 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:12.170
 see you
