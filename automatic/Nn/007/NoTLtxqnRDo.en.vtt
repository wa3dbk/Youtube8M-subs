it's a mine way and Sons piano and you

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.639 
it's a mine way and Sons piano and you
step<00:00:38.460> on<00:00:38.579> the<00:00:38.610> pressure<00:00:38.850> plates<00:00:39.469> the<00:00:40.469> right

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649

notes<00:00:40.860> play<00:00:42.980> the<00:00:43.980> boy<00:00:44.160> Jack<00:00:45.559> and<00:00:47.059> you<00:00:48.059> can<00:00:48.239> play

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
notes play the boy Jack and you can play

00:00:48.450 --> 00:01:15.710 
notes play the boy Jack and you can play
it<00:00:48.480> all<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:48.840> way<00:00:49.020> through<00:01:14.420> it's<00:01:15.420> pretty<00:01:15.540> easy

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
it all the way through it's pretty easy

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.170 
it all the way through it's pretty easy
to<00:01:15.840> make<00:01:16.049> actually<00:01:16.530> the<00:01:16.740> there<00:01:17.700> was<00:01:17.820> only<00:01:17.939> one

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
to make actually the there was only one

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.060 
to make actually the there was only one
tricky<00:01:18.479> part<00:01:18.659> that<00:01:18.869> was<00:01:19.049> having<00:01:19.409> two<00:01:19.710> notes

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
tricky part that was having two notes

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.100 
tricky part that was having two notes
right<00:01:20.369> next<00:01:20.700> to<00:01:20.790> each<00:01:20.820> other<00:01:21.030> without<00:01:21.750> running

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
right next to each other without running

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.469 
right next to each other without running
any<00:01:22.350> redstone<00:01:22.920> out<00:01:23.100> of<00:01:23.250> the<00:01:23.310> side<00:01:23.520> I<00:01:23.820> used<00:01:24.360> a

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
any redstone out of the side I used a

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:25.969 
any redstone out of the side I used a
trick<00:01:24.720> that<00:01:24.990> I<00:01:25.020> haven't<00:01:25.229> seen<00:01:25.409> used<00:01:25.619> elsewhere

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
trick that I haven't seen used elsewhere

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.560 
trick that I haven't seen used elsewhere
so<00:01:26.220> let<00:01:26.310> me<00:01:26.369> show<00:01:26.520> you<00:01:26.549> how<00:01:27.030> it<00:01:27.150> works<00:01:27.180> really

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
so let me show you how it works really

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.870 
so let me show you how it works really
quickly<00:01:29.960> what<00:01:30.960> you<00:01:31.079> do<00:01:31.259> is<00:01:31.590> run<00:01:32.159> the<00:01:32.340> redstone

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
quickly what you do is run the redstone

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.420 
quickly what you do is run the redstone
this<00:01:33.060> way<00:01:33.240> one<00:01:34.110> note<00:01:34.290> is<00:01:34.320> over<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:34.860> back<00:01:35.130> right

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
this way one note is over the back right

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.490 
this way one note is over the back right
corner<00:01:35.490> here<00:01:36.210> and<00:01:36.390> one<00:01:36.900> note<00:01:37.079> is<00:01:37.110> over<00:01:37.409> the

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
corner here and one note is over the

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.719 
corner here and one note is over the
back<00:01:37.680> left<00:01:37.979> and<00:01:38.340> you<00:01:38.790> run<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:39.119> redstone<00:01:39.680> 415

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:40.729 
back left and you run the redstone 415

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:43.460 
back left and you run the redstone 415
along<00:01:41.729> and<00:01:42.030> you<00:01:42.600> take<00:01:42.869> advantage<00:01:42.960> of<00:01:43.259> the<00:01:43.350> fact

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
along and you take advantage of the fact

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.200 
along and you take advantage of the fact
that<00:01:43.619> something<00:01:44.040> that<00:01:44.070> powers<00:01:44.490> redstone<00:01:44.970> can

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
that something that powers redstone can

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.810 
that something that powers redstone can
only<00:01:45.329> power<00:01:45.630> it<00:01:45.780> for<00:01:45.960> 15<00:01:46.290> blocks<00:01:46.520> at<00:01:47.520> the<00:01:47.670> end

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
only power it for 15 blocks at the end

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.120 
only power it for 15 blocks at the end
this<00:01:48.540> block<00:01:48.810> right<00:01:48.840> here<00:01:49.049> is<00:01:49.380> to<00:01:49.409> separate<00:01:49.950> the

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
this block right here is to separate the

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.770 
this block right here is to separate the
two<00:01:50.280> lines<00:01:50.520> and<00:01:50.909> then<00:01:51.000> run<00:01:51.210> it<00:01:51.329> into<00:01:51.479> the<00:01:51.570> note

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
two lines and then run it into the note

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.490 
two lines and then run it into the note
blocks<00:01:52.049> and<00:01:52.610> because<00:01:53.610> it's<00:01:53.759> exactly<00:01:54.119> 15<00:01:54.659> the

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
blocks and because it's exactly 15 the

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.980 
blocks and because it's exactly 15 the
note<00:01:55.710> on<00:01:55.890> this<00:01:56.070> side<00:01:56.369> can<00:01:56.790> only<00:01:57.060> barely<00:01:57.570> reach

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
note on this side can only barely reach

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.990 
note on this side can only barely reach
this<00:01:58.259> note<00:01:58.530> and<00:01:58.740> play<00:01:58.979> it<00:01:59.159> and<00:01:59.280> it<00:01:59.430> can't<00:01:59.700> reach

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
this note and play it and it can't reach

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.690 
this note and play it and it can't reach
this<00:02:00.149> other<00:02:00.390> note<00:02:00.630> and<00:02:00.869> vice<00:02:01.380> versa<00:02:01.700> works

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
this other note and vice versa works

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.789 
this other note and vice versa works
pretty<00:02:02.850> well<00:02:02.969> there<00:02:03.329> is<00:02:03.450> a<00:02:03.479> bug<00:02:03.750> that<00:02:03.799> you

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
pretty well there is a bug that you

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:08.940 
pretty well there is a bug that you
can't<00:02:05.040> play<00:02:05.250> two<00:02:05.310> notes<00:02:05.610> at<00:02:05.820> the<00:02:05.880> same<00:02:05.969> time<00:02:06.420> so

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 
can't play two notes at the same time so

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:10.919 
can't play two notes at the same time so
I'm<00:02:09.550> going<00:02:09.729> to<00:02:09.849> step<00:02:10.030> on<00:02:10.149> both<00:02:10.360> of<00:02:10.390> them<00:02:10.720> and

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:10.929 
I'm going to step on both of them and

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:14.400 
I'm going to step on both of them and
listen<00:02:11.200> to<00:02:11.260> what<00:02:11.349> happens<00:02:12.930> the<00:02:13.930> second<00:02:14.290> note

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.410 
listen to what happens the second note

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:18.030 
listen to what happens the second note
only<00:02:14.739> played<00:02:15.010> once<00:02:15.400> the<00:02:15.670> first<00:02:16.030> note<00:02:16.920> once<00:02:17.920> the

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
only played once the first note once the

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.630 
only played once the first note once the
first<00:02:18.280> notes<00:02:18.489> pressure<00:02:18.819> plate<00:02:19.180> released<00:02:20.640> but

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
first notes pressure plate released but

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.369 
first notes pressure plate released but
it's<00:02:22.300> good<00:02:22.450> enough<00:02:22.599> no<00:02:22.959> one's<00:02:23.110> going<00:02:23.200> to<00:02:23.260> be

00:02:23.369 --> 00:02:23.379 
it's good enough no one's going to be

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:27.089 
it's good enough no one's going to be
