00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
about forty dollars bow and we and the

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.980 
about forty dollars bow and we and the
solution<00:01:32.340> to<00:01:32.369> this<00:01:32.700> I<00:01:33.000> mean<00:01:33.210> we<00:01:33.450> will<00:01:33.869> do

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
solution to this I mean we will do

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.200 
solution to this I mean we will do
everything<00:01:34.140> in<00:01:34.500> our<00:01:34.530> and<00:01:34.799> our<00:01:35.070> powers<00:01:35.579> to<00:01:35.939> and

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
everything in our and our powers to and

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.800 
everything in our and our powers to and
we<00:01:36.840> agree<00:01:37.170> that<00:01:37.200> there<00:01:37.740> is<00:01:38.009> great<00:01:38.810> suffering

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
we agree that there is great suffering

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.889 
we agree that there is great suffering
when<00:01:40.590> the<00:01:40.710> price<00:01:40.890> of<00:01:40.920> gasoline<00:01:41.750> increases<00:01:42.750> in

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
when the price of gasoline increases in

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:44.690 
when the price of gasoline increases in
the<00:01:43.020> United<00:01:43.259> States<00:01:43.500> and<00:01:43.680> so<00:01:44.310> we<00:01:44.579> are<00:01:44.670> very

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
the United States and so we are very

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.870 
the United States and so we are very
concerned<00:01:45.270> about<00:01:45.659> this<00:01:46.020> and<00:01:46.320> as<00:01:46.950> I've

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
concerned about this and as I've

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.380 
concerned about this and as I've
repeatedly<00:01:48.479> said<00:01:49.759> in<00:01:50.759> the<00:01:50.970> Department<00:01:51.360> of

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
repeatedly said in the Department of

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.960 
repeatedly said in the Department of
Energy<00:01:51.659> the<00:01:52.409> what<00:01:53.220> we're<00:01:53.369> trying<00:01:53.579> to<00:01:53.670> do<00:01:53.850> is

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
Energy the what we're trying to do is

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.120 
Energy the what we're trying to do is
diversify<00:01:54.659> our<00:01:54.990> energy<00:01:55.290> supply<00:01:55.920> of

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
diversify our energy supply of

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.940 
diversify our energy supply of
transportation<00:01:57.170> so<00:01:58.170> that<00:01:58.350> we<00:01:58.469> have<00:01:58.500> cost

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
transportation so that we have cost

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.429 
transportation so that we have cost
effect<00:01:59.280> means<00:01:59.549> natural<00:02:00.090> gas<00:02:00.270> is<00:02:00.509> great<00:02:00.869> and<00:02:01.110> so

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
effect means natural gas is great and so

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.230 
effect means natural gas is great and so
we're<00:02:01.619> pushing<00:02:01.979> on<00:02:02.250> natural<00:02:02.640> gas<00:02:02.700> and<00:02:03.000> for

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
we're pushing on natural gas and for

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.440 
we're pushing on natural gas and for
transportation<00:02:03.600> electrification<00:02:04.469> is<00:02:05.450> great

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
transportation electrification is great

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.109 
transportation electrification is great
because<00:02:06.689> then<00:02:07.020> that<00:02:07.229> offloads<00:02:08.009> in<00:02:08.280> life<00:02:08.940> are

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
because then that offloads in life are

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.360 
because then that offloads in life are
efficient<00:02:09.629> we've<00:02:09.810> just<00:02:10.560> and<00:02:10.800> the<00:02:11.039> battery

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
efficient we've just and the battery

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.620 
efficient we've just and the battery
research<00:02:11.670> for<00:02:12.090> weidman<00:02:12.270> funding<00:02:12.780> we've<00:02:13.020> had

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
research for weidman funding we've had

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:15.810 
research for weidman funding we've had
some<00:02:14.410> pretty<00:02:14.650> spectacular<00:02:14.950> breakthroughs

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:15.820 
some pretty spectacular breakthroughs

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:18.390 
some pretty spectacular breakthroughs
one<00:02:16.090> just<00:02:16.360> announced<00:02:16.750> yesterday<00:02:16.930> that<00:02:17.400> looks

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
one just announced yesterday that looks

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.490 
one just announced yesterday that looks
like<00:02:18.640> it's<00:02:18.910> going<00:02:19.180> to<00:02:19.300> at<00:02:19.540> least<00:02:19.810> decrease<00:02:20.110> the

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
like it's going to at least decrease the

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.590 
like it's going to at least decrease the
cause<00:02:20.710> of<00:02:20.740> these<00:02:21.100> batteries<00:02:21.490> to<00:02:22.150> fold<00:02:22.420> and

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:22.600 
cause of these batteries to fold and

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:26.640 
cause of these batteries to fold and
maybe<00:02:23.380> more<00:02:24.300> biofuels<00:02:25.300> a<00:02:25.780> very<00:02:26.110> aggressive

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
maybe more biofuels a very aggressive

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:28.110 
maybe more biofuels a very aggressive
program<00:02:27.010> starting<00:02:27.730> the<00:02:27.790> previous

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
program starting the previous

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.780 
program starting the previous
administration<00:02:28.270> but<00:02:28.840> continuing<00:02:29.610> again<00:02:30.610> to

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
administration but continuing again to

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:32.880 
administration but continuing again to
diversify<00:02:31.360> that<00:02:31.600> supply<00:02:31.960> of<00:02:32.140> transportation

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
diversify that supply of transportation

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:34.470 
diversify that supply of transportation
fuel<00:02:33.070> and<00:02:33.280> so<00:02:33.430> these<00:02:33.670> are<00:02:33.880> the<00:02:33.970> things<00:02:34.150> we're

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
fuel and so these are the things we're

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.240 
fuel and so these are the things we're
doing<00:02:34.510> and<00:02:35.080> we're<00:02:35.200> very<00:02:35.530> focused<00:02:35.740> on<00:02:36.070> that

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
doing and we're very focused on that

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:38.040 
doing and we're very focused on that
because<00:02:36.580> we<00:02:36.730> understand<00:02:37.360> the<00:02:37.570> economic

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:38.050 
because we understand the economic

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:40.200 
because we understand the economic
impacts<00:02:38.410> that<00:02:38.920> has<00:02:39.160> an<00:02:39.340> all<00:02:39.490> Americans<00:02:40.000> and

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:40.210 
impacts that has an all Americans and

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:44.760 
impacts that has an all Americans and
our<00:02:40.630> economy<00:02:42.180> but<00:02:43.180> is<00:02:43.360> overall<00:02:43.840> goal<00:02:44.140> to<00:02:44.650> get

build and strengthen our economy and to

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:56.880 
build and strengthen our economy and to
good<00:02:53.020> decrease<00:02:53.470> our<00:02:53.650> dependency<00:02:54.310> on<00:02:54.340> oil<00:02:55.890> but

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890 
good decrease our dependency on oil but
