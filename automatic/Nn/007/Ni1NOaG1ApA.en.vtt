 Good evening everyone on Youtuber 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:12.060
 It's moonlight night 

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:14.840
 Today has come to light of a flashlight to par sky golf course 

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:19.210
 This fenix pd 35 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:19.210
 I get 850 lumens with the new model 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:26.680
 I feel like this is better than walking 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:31.110
 I think it's just a good feeling 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:31.110
 After all it is tentative that it is 850 ru 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:40.630
 You can see something like a clubhouse over there 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:45.650
 So 

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:49.730

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:53.510
