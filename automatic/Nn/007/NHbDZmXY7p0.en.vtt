how<00:00:19.710> it<00:00:19.800> gets<00:00:19.859> the<00:00:20.010> sensor<00:00:20.430> where<00:00:21.150> the<00:00:21.300> sensor

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
how it gets the sensor where the sensor

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.410 
how it gets the sensor where the sensor
is<00:00:21.810> where<00:00:22.230> the<00:00:22.320> shutter<00:00:22.590> is<00:00:22.800> and<00:00:23.340> where<00:00:24.269> the

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
is where the shutter is and where the

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.540 
is where the shutter is and where the
aperture<00:00:24.779> is<00:00:24.930> so<00:00:25.710> when<00:00:26.070> you<00:00:26.099> go<00:00:26.220> ahead<00:00:26.400> and<00:00:26.490> do

the wider it is open the more light at

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.139 
the wider it is open the more light at
let's<00:00:54.390> N<00:00:54.600> and<00:00:54.870> the<00:00:55.440> smaller<00:00:55.860> the<00:00:56.010> opening<00:00:56.160> the

let's N and the smaller the opening the
less<00:00:57.420> light<00:00:57.690> it<00:00:57.989> let's<00:00:58.260> said<00:00:59.870> after<00:01:00.870> it<00:01:00.989> passes

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
less light it let's said after it passes

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:02.510 
less light it let's said after it passes
through<00:01:01.530> the<00:01:01.649> aperture<00:01:02.039> ring<00:01:02.190> is<00:01:02.340> going<00:01:02.460> to

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
through the aperture ring is going to

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.700 
through the aperture ring is going to
hit<00:01:02.699> the<00:01:02.820> mirror<00:01:03.210> and<00:01:03.840> the<00:01:03.930> mirror<00:01:03.960> is<00:01:04.260> in<00:01:04.559> the

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
hit the mirror and the mirror is in the

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.710 
hit the mirror and the mirror is in the
way<00:01:04.860> of<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.250> sensor<00:01:05.850> and<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:06.119> shutter<00:01:06.420> which

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
way of the sensor and the shutter which

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.320 
way of the sensor and the shutter which
is<00:01:06.900> highlighted<00:01:07.409> in<00:01:07.680> red<00:01:07.710> and<00:01:08.159> green<00:01:08.580> so<00:01:09.210> this

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
is highlighted in red and green so this

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.480 
is highlighted in red and green so this
is<00:01:09.479> a<00:01:09.510> mirror<00:01:09.810> right<00:01:09.960> here<00:01:09.990> and<00:01:10.409> behind<00:01:11.100> it<00:01:11.250> is

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
is a mirror right here and behind it is

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.730 
is a mirror right here and behind it is
the<00:01:11.760> shutter<00:01:12.090> so<00:01:12.720> that<00:01:13.049> mirror<00:01:13.290> will<00:01:13.439> have<00:01:13.590> to

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
the shutter so that mirror will have to

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:14.870 
the shutter so that mirror will have to
get<00:01:13.830> out<00:01:13.890> of<00:01:14.010> the<00:01:14.070> way<00:01:14.159> whenever<00:01:14.549> you<00:01:14.640> take<00:01:14.820> a

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
get out of the way whenever you take a

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.570 
get out of the way whenever you take a
photo<00:01:15.560> after<00:01:16.560> that<00:01:16.890> it's<00:01:17.009> going<00:01:17.100> to<00:01:17.159> bounce<00:01:17.310> up

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
photo after that it's going to bounce up

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.170 
photo after that it's going to bounce up
into<00:01:18.030> the<00:01:18.240> prism<00:01:19.700> it's<00:01:20.700> gonna<00:01:20.820> be<00:01:20.939> knocked

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
into the prism it's gonna be knocked

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.609 
into the prism it's gonna be knocked
around<00:01:21.330> a<00:01:21.509> little<00:01:21.600> bit<00:01:21.780> in<00:01:21.869> there<00:01:22.049> until<00:01:22.439> it

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
around a little bit in there until it

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.160 
around a little bit in there until it
comes<00:01:22.799> back<00:01:23.100> out<00:01:23.280> through<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:23.610> rear<00:01:24.240> view

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
comes back out through the rear view

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.160 
comes back out through the rear view
finder<00:01:25.790> alright<00:01:26.790> so<00:01:27.360> when<00:01:27.600> you<00:01:27.630> actually<00:01:27.840> go

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
finder alright so when you actually go

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.230 
finder alright so when you actually go
to<00:01:28.200> take<00:01:28.650> the<00:01:28.860> photo<00:01:29.130> the<00:01:29.729> mirror<00:01:30.000> is<00:01:30.090> gonna

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
to take the photo the mirror is gonna

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.050 
to take the photo the mirror is gonna
raise<00:01:30.540> up<00:01:30.750> out<00:01:30.960> of<00:01:31.140> the<00:01:31.229> way<00:01:31.380> first<00:01:31.890> then<00:01:32.790> after

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
raise up out of the way first then after

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.590 
raise up out of the way first then after
that<00:01:33.150> the<00:01:33.270> shutter<00:01:33.600> is<00:01:33.869> gonna<00:01:34.829> move<00:01:35.040> up<00:01:35.250> as

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600 
that the shutter is gonna move up as

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.149 
that the shutter is gonna move up as
well<00:01:36.600> so<00:01:36.900> that<00:01:37.049> the<00:01:37.140> light<00:01:37.320> can<00:01:37.619> go<00:01:37.890> straight

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
well so that the light can go straight

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.899 
well so that the light can go straight
through<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:38.939> lens<00:01:39.119> and<00:01:39.390> hit<00:01:39.720> the<00:01:39.810> sensor<00:01:40.909> all

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
through the lens and hit the sensor all

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.490 
through the lens and hit the sensor all
right<00:01:42.060> what<00:01:42.180> I'm<00:01:42.240> gonna<00:01:42.329> show<00:01:42.450> you<00:01:42.509> now<00:01:42.540> is<00:01:43.110> the

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
right what I'm gonna show you now is the

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.560 
right what I'm gonna show you now is the
sensor<00:01:44.220> so<00:01:44.729> when<00:01:45.030> you<00:01:45.119> hit<00:01:45.240> the<00:01:45.360> shutter

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
sensor so when you hit the shutter

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.359 
sensor so when you hit the shutter
button<00:01:45.630> the<00:01:46.200> mirror<00:01:46.500> moves<00:01:46.619> out<00:01:46.860> away<00:01:47.100> and

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
button the mirror moves out away and

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.039 
button the mirror moves out away and
then<00:01:47.520> that<00:01:47.640> shutter<00:01:48.000> in<00:01:48.240> the<00:01:48.329> back<00:01:48.509> moves<00:01:48.899> out

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
then that shutter in the back moves out

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:50.480 
then that shutter in the back moves out
of<00:01:49.110> the<00:01:49.170> way<00:01:49.229> now<00:01:49.409> we<00:01:49.470> can<00:01:49.680> see<00:01:49.890> the<00:01:50.070> sensor

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
of the way now we can see the sensor

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.789 
of the way now we can see the sensor
which<00:01:51.180> normally<00:01:51.840> looks<00:01:52.079> just<00:01:52.290> like<00:01:52.439> a<00:01:52.500> green

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
which normally looks just like a green

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.219 
which normally looks just like a green
panel<00:01:53.189> there<00:01:53.939> are<00:01:53.970> two<00:01:54.090> ways<00:01:54.360> to<00:01:54.509> control<00:01:54.630> how

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
panel there are two ways to control how

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.020 
panel there are two ways to control how
much<00:01:55.350> light<00:01:55.409> comes<00:01:55.979> into<00:01:56.159> the<00:01:56.310> camera<00:01:56.610> now

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
much light comes into the camera now

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.160 
much light comes into the camera now
next<00:01:57.240> week<00:01:57.390> we're<00:01:57.509> going<00:01:57.600> to<00:01:57.659> talk<00:01:57.810> about<00:01:57.869> the

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
next week we're going to talk about the

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.039 
next week we're going to talk about the
artistic<00:01:58.530> value<00:01:58.740> of<00:01:59.399> these<00:01:59.850> but<00:02:00.659> today<00:02:00.869> we're

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
artistic value of these but today we're

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:02.600 
artistic value of these but today we're
just<00:02:01.079> gonna<00:02:01.259> focus<00:02:01.530> on<00:02:01.799> how<00:02:02.189> light<00:02:02.460> is

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
just gonna focus on how light is

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.249 
just gonna focus on how light is
controlled<00:02:03.090> when<00:02:03.360> it<00:02:03.450> comes<00:02:03.630> into<00:02:03.810> the<00:02:03.899> camera

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
controlled when it comes into the camera

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.170 
controlled when it comes into the camera
the<00:02:04.469> first<00:02:05.130> is<00:02:05.340> through<00:02:05.490> the<00:02:05.579> aperture<00:02:06.000> ring

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
the first is through the aperture ring

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.270 
the first is through the aperture ring
and<00:02:06.509> that's<00:02:06.750> how<00:02:06.930> wide<00:02:07.229> or<00:02:07.259> small<00:02:07.710> so<00:02:07.979> as<00:02:08.190> you

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
and that's how wide or small so as you

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.339 
and that's how wide or small so as you
can<00:02:08.369> see<00:02:08.580> when<00:02:08.910> you<00:02:09.060> when<00:02:09.509> you<00:02:09.599> close<00:02:09.869> down<00:02:10.140> the

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
can see when you when you close down the

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:10.779 
can see when you when you close down the
aperture

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:10.789 
aperture

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:13.839 
aperture
ring<00:02:10.969> you're<00:02:11.629> gonna<00:02:11.689> let<00:02:11.930> less<00:02:12.230> light<00:02:12.590> in<00:02:12.849> and

00:02:13.839 --> 00:02:13.849 
ring you're gonna let less light in and

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:15.429 
ring you're gonna let less light in and
when<00:02:13.969> you<00:02:14.030> open<00:02:14.239> it<00:02:14.299> back<00:02:14.420> up<00:02:14.480> you<00:02:15.140> can<00:02:15.170> let

00:02:15.429 --> 00:02:15.439 
when you open it back up you can let

00:02:15.439 --> 00:02:19.240 
when you open it back up you can let
more<00:02:15.890> light<00:02:15.920> in<00:02:17.439> the<00:02:18.439> other<00:02:18.469> way<00:02:18.769> is<00:02:19.010> through

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
more light in the other way is through

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:22.839 
more light in the other way is through
the<00:02:19.459> shutter<00:02:19.819> the<00:02:20.650> shutter<00:02:21.650> can<00:02:22.040> raise<00:02:22.250> and

00:02:22.839 --> 00:02:22.849 
the shutter the shutter can raise and

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:25.390 
the shutter the shutter can raise and
lower<00:02:23.439> and<00:02:24.439> that<00:02:24.890> right<00:02:25.069> there<00:02:25.099> was<00:02:25.250> a

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
lower and that right there was a

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.990 
lower and that right there was a
two-second<00:02:26.329> shutter<00:02:27.579> the<00:02:28.579> next<00:02:28.790> we're<00:02:28.939> gonna

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000 
two-second shutter the next we're gonna

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.210 
two-second shutter the next we're gonna
look<00:02:29.150> at<00:02:29.329> is<00:02:29.510> a<00:02:29.540> half<00:02:30.200> second<00:02:30.709> shutter<00:02:30.920> so<00:02:31.159> you

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
look at is a half second shutter so you

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:32.679 
look at is a half second shutter so you
can<00:02:31.340> see<00:02:31.459> it's<00:02:31.579> a<00:02:31.640> lot<00:02:31.790> faster<00:02:32.000> it's<00:02:32.359> gonna<00:02:32.420> let

00:02:32.679 --> 00:02:32.689 
can see it's a lot faster it's gonna let

00:02:32.689 --> 00:02:36.520 
can see it's a lot faster it's gonna let
a<00:02:32.930> lot<00:02:33.109> less<00:02:33.439> light<00:02:33.769> in<00:02:34.720> so<00:02:35.720> that<00:02:36.049> concludes

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
a lot less light in so that concludes

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:38.619 
a lot less light in so that concludes
the<00:02:36.829> anatomy<00:02:37.280> of<00:02:37.370> camera<00:02:37.730> if<00:02:38.060> you<00:02:38.239> have<00:02:38.389> any
