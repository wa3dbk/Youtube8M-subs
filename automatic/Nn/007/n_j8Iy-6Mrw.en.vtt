00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:28.869 
nice they're only a single creature but

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:31.830 
nice they're only a single creature but
they<00:01:29.289> have<00:01:29.759> immunities<00:01:30.759> and<00:01:31.090> a<00:01:31.329> lot<00:01:31.479> of<00:01:31.509> attack

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:31.840

00:01:36.569 --> 00:01:36.579 
to do me too much good right now but a

00:01:36.579 --> 00:01:39.809

00:01:39.809 --> 00:01:39.819 
lot of attack power I thought they had

lot of attack power I thought they had
fire-breathing<00:01:40.390> but<00:01:40.659> apparently<00:01:41.350> none<00:01:41.770> oh

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
fire-breathing but apparently none oh

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.820

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
battle because I don't think this is an

battle because I don't think this is an
intelligence<00:02:19.359> but<00:02:19.600> it<00:02:20.440> seemed<00:02:20.709> to<00:02:20.799> do<00:02:20.920> all

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040

walls<00:02:29.350> rather<00:02:29.650> than<00:02:29.709> fighting<00:02:30.010> through<00:02:30.340> them

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:30.489

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:39.910 
walls rather than fighting through them
all<00:02:30.579> day<00:02:32.310> that<00:02:33.310> was<00:02:33.430> painful

walked forward with that's foolish okay
well<00:03:22.670> my<00:03:23.299> tactics<00:03:23.840> aren't<00:03:24.019> exactly<00:03:24.440> perfect

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:24.950

00:03:36.539 --> 00:03:36.549 

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:38.800 

fighting<00:03:37.549> over<00:03:37.819> castle<00:03:38.209> walls<00:03:38.239> gives<00:03:38.660> you<00:03:38.780> a

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:38.810 
fighting over castle walls gives you a

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:42.970 
fighting over castle walls gives you a
penalty<00:03:39.760> and<00:03:40.760> that<00:03:41.000> penalty<00:03:41.420> is<00:03:41.750> well<00:03:42.500> not<00:03:42.920> a

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:42.980 
penalty and that penalty is well not a

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:46.060 
penalty and that penalty is well not a
good<00:03:43.220> thing<00:03:43.370> I<00:03:43.700> mean<00:03:44.380> has<00:03:45.380> there<00:03:45.530> ever<00:03:45.590> been<00:03:45.920> a

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:47.630 
case where a penalty was a good thing

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:56.259

than hellhounds abort generally speaking

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:23.580 
than hellhounds abort generally speaking
it's<00:05:21.640> not<00:05:21.850> worth<00:05:22.120> it<00:05:22.300> to<00:05:22.360> make<00:05:22.930> artifacts

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:23.590 
it's not worth it to make artifacts

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:28.160 
it's not worth it to make artifacts
because<00:05:24.460> heroes<00:05:25.030> die<00:05:25.300> to<00:05:25.360> easily<00:05:26.700> otherwise

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:28.170 
because heroes die to easily otherwise

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:31.470 
because heroes die to easily otherwise
heroes<00:05:29.170> become<00:05:29.440> quite<00:05:29.740> powerful<00:05:30.310> but<00:05:30.610> they

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:31.480 
heroes become quite powerful but they

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:33.510 
heroes become quite powerful but they
can<00:05:31.660> be<00:05:31.690> killed<00:05:31.960> with<00:05:32.140> one<00:05:32.350> simple<00:05:32.800> spell<00:05:33.220> and

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:33.520 
can be killed with one simple spell and

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:36.870 
can be killed with one simple spell and
so<00:05:34.480> a<00:05:34.840> 30-man<00:05:35.350> a<00:05:35.410> spell<00:05:35.770> can<00:05:36.070> take<00:05:36.340> out<00:05:36.520> a<00:05:36.550> hero

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:36.880 
so a 30-man a spell can take out a hero

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:38.670 
so a 30-man a spell can take out a hero
wearing<00:05:37.540> a<00:05:37.660> thousand<00:05:38.140> mana<00:05:38.290> worth<00:05:38.530> of

wearing a thousand mana worth of

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:40.730 
wearing a thousand mana worth of
artifacts<00:05:39.130> which<00:05:39.550> is<00:05:39.700> a<00:05:39.730> very<00:05:39.940> sad<00:05:40.180> thing

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:40.740 
artifacts which is a very sad thing

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:42.450 
artifacts which is a very sad thing
generally<00:05:41.740> I<00:05:41.770> don't<00:05:42.010> suggest<00:05:42.160> making

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:42.460 
generally I don't suggest making

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:45.630 
generally I don't suggest making
artifacts<00:05:43.020> okay<00:05:44.020> well<00:05:44.290> we<00:05:45.190> took<00:05:45.370> out<00:05:45.520> an

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:45.640 
artifacts okay well we took out an

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:47.250 
artifacts okay well we took out an
opponent's<00:05:46.090> we've<00:05:46.630> made<00:05:46.780> a<00:05:46.810> good<00:05:46.990> amount<00:05:47.140> of

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:47.260 
opponent's we've made a good amount of

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:48.660 
opponent's we've made a good amount of
progress<00:05:47.440> I<00:05:47.770> think<00:05:48.040> it's<00:05:48.130> a<00:05:48.190> good<00:05:48.310> point<00:05:48.580> to

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:48.670 
progress I think it's a good point to
