00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
epic start on that are crazy so let's

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.620 
epic start on that are crazy so let's
just<00:00:26.369> start<00:00:26.550> leveling<00:00:26.910> this<00:00:27.949> and<00:00:29.539> there<00:00:30.539> we

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
just start leveling this and there we

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.770 
just start leveling this and there we
got<00:00:30.750> first<00:00:31.199> evolution<00:00:32.600> doesn't<00:00:33.600> look<00:00:33.750> that

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
got first evolution doesn't look that

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:40.610 
got first evolution doesn't look that
good<00:00:34.260> on<00:00:34.320> first<00:00:34.649> evolution<00:00:38.239> lag<00:00:39.239> is<00:00:39.629> just<00:00:39.870> so

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
good on first evolution lag is just so

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:53.990 
good on first evolution lag is just so
bad<00:00:41.420> right<00:00:42.420> now<00:00:44.300> and<00:00:46.100> up<00:00:47.100> to<00:00:47.370> 32<00:00:50.030> mm<00:00:51.030> ok<00:00:53.000> now

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
bad right now and up to 32 mm ok now

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.700 
bad right now and up to 32 mm ok now
let's<00:00:54.210> quickly<00:00:54.449> get<00:00:54.719> it's<00:00:54.870> a<00:00:54.960> loss<00:00:55.140> evolution

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
let's quickly get it's a loss evolution

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.500 
let's quickly get it's a loss evolution
because<00:00:55.800> it<00:00:55.920> actually<00:00:56.039> looks<00:00:56.370> a<00:00:56.579> lot<00:00:57.270> better

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
because it actually looks a lot better

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.700 
because it actually looks a lot better
than<00:00:57.750> a<00:00:57.780> dozen<00:00:58.020> nail<00:01:00.260> and<00:01:01.260> then<00:01:01.379> i'll<00:01:01.469> show<00:01:01.620> you

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
than a dozen nail and then i'll show you

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:07.460 
than a dozen nail and then i'll show you
the<00:01:01.829> stats<00:01:02.180> when<00:01:03.180> i<00:01:03.210> get<00:01:03.359> to<00:01:03.780> there<00:01:05.780> it<00:01:06.780> gets<00:01:06.990> to

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
the stats when i get to there it gets to

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:16.510 
the stats when i get to there it gets to
49<00:01:11.150> and<00:01:12.920> this<00:01:13.920> gets<00:01:14.070> it<00:01:14.250> to<00:01:14.369> last<00:01:14.750> evolution

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:16.520 
49 and this gets it to last evolution

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:18.950 
49 and this gets it to last evolution
it's<00:01:17.520> perfect<00:01:18.210> for<00:01:18.240> me<00:01:18.420> to<00:01:18.540> use<00:01:18.689> against

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
it's perfect for me to use against

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.740 
it's perfect for me to use against
champions<00:01:19.530> placer<00:01:19.799> didn't<00:01:20.280> really<00:01:20.520> have

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:20.750 
champions placer didn't really have

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.899 
champions placer didn't really have
anything<00:01:21.750> else<00:01:22.049> to<00:01:22.380> use<00:01:23.189> against<00:01:23.460> six<00:01:23.700> of<00:01:23.820> a

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
anything else to use against six of a

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.090 
anything else to use against six of a
wasteland<00:01:24.360> plus<00:01:24.689> but<00:01:24.960> that's<00:01:25.200> Molly<00:01:25.560> not<00:01:25.920> that

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
wasteland plus but that's Molly not that

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:32.539 
wasteland plus but that's Molly not that
strong<00:01:26.400> so<00:01:28.040> and<00:01:29.509> still<00:01:30.509> goin<00:01:31.079> it<00:01:32.009> will<00:01:32.430> be

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
strong so and still goin it will be

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:39.190 
strong so and still goin it will be
level<00:01:32.880> 99<00:01:33.210> soon<00:01:34.040> hopefully<00:01:35.040> if<00:01:35.640> it<00:01:36.060> hurries<00:01:36.420> up

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.200 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.440 

yeah<00:01:40.200> takes<00:01:40.770> me<00:01:40.950> a<00:01:40.979> while<00:01:41.159> to<00:01:41.220> gain<00:01:41.579> so<00:01:42.390> I'm

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
yeah takes me a while to gain so I'm

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.469 
yeah takes me a while to gain so I'm
pointing<00:01:42.720> war<00:01:43.140> since<00:01:43.439> I'm<00:01:43.850> pretty<00:01:44.850> slow<00:01:45.240> on

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
pointing war since I'm pretty slow on

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.460 
pointing war since I'm pretty slow on
this<00:01:45.600> device<00:01:45.990> and<00:01:46.259> toy<00:01:46.439> switch<00:01:47.430> out<00:01:47.670> then<00:01:48.030> I

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:48.470 
this device and toy switch out then I

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:50.749 
this device and toy switch out then I
will<00:01:49.470> be<00:01:49.590> a<00:01:49.619> lot<00:01:49.829> faster<00:01:50.009> when<00:01:50.280> I<00:01:50.340> go<00:01:50.520> to<00:01:50.549> my

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
will be a lot faster when I go to my

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:55.280 
will be a lot faster when I go to my
other<00:01:51.149> device<00:01:52.700> and<00:01:53.750> hopefully<00:01:54.750> gain<00:01:54.930> a<00:01:54.990> lot

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
other device and hopefully gain a lot

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.719 
other device and hopefully gain a lot
more<00:01:55.470> points<00:01:55.799> and<00:01:55.920> a<00:01:55.950> half<00:01:56.159> i'm<00:01:56.700> only<00:01:56.909> at<00:01:58.340> 150<00:01:59.340> k

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
more points and a half i'm only at 150 k

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:04.990 
more points and a half i'm only at 150 k
at<00:02:00.119> the<00:02:00.450> moment<00:02:00.840> is<00:02:00.990> i<00:02:01.170> think<00:02:01.229> as<00:02:01.829> of<00:02:02.310> now<00:02:02.930> and

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
at the moment is i think as of now and

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.930 
at the moment is i think as of now and
yeah<00:02:06.000> there's<00:02:06.570> a<00:02:06.810> couple<00:02:07.439> that<00:02:07.680> are<00:02:07.740> over<00:02:08.220> 300

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
yeah there's a couple that are over 300

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.660 
yeah there's a couple that are over 300
k<00:02:09.239> so<00:02:09.800> better<00:02:10.800> start<00:02:11.190> getting<00:02:11.580> up<00:02:11.819> there

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
k so better start getting up there

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:19.380 
k so better start getting up there
and<00:02:13.680> level<00:02:14.680> 81<00:02:17.370> did<00:02:18.370> I<00:02:18.459> mention<00:02:18.640> revelation

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
know if i did but if a new water spirit

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:26.940 
know if i did but if a new water spirit
ama<00:02:25.660> came<00:02:25.930> it<00:02:26.050> out<00:02:26.170> then<00:02:26.440> that<00:02:26.470> would<00:02:26.709> be<00:02:26.830> my

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
spirit and that's why i like revelation

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:35.580 
spirit and that's why i like revelation
rogues<00:02:34.390> and<00:02:34.510> the<00:02:34.750> fact<00:02:34.930> that<00:02:34.989> it<00:02:35.170> looks<00:02:35.200> pretty

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
rogues and the fact that it looks pretty

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:38.970 
rogues and the fact that it looks pretty
good<00:02:36.420> except<00:02:37.420> for<00:02:37.540> the<00:02:37.660> shielded<00:02:38.319> unlike<00:02:38.860> the

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
good except for the shielded unlike the

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:47.610 
good except for the shielded unlike the
shield<00:02:40.500> 91<00:02:43.349> getting<00:02:44.349> there<00:02:46.170> this<00:02:47.170> will<00:02:47.410> get<00:02:47.530> up

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
shield 91 getting there this will get up

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.770 
shield 91 getting there this will get up
to<00:02:47.650> 96<00:02:48.370> and<00:02:48.730> then<00:02:48.880> i'll<00:02:49.000> use<00:02:49.180> two<00:02:49.390> more<00:02:49.600> to<00:02:49.690> get

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
to 96 and then i'll use two more to get

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:57.030 
to 96 and then i'll use two more to get
to<00:02:49.840> 98<00:02:51.299> 96<00:02:53.880> think<00:02:54.880> both<00:02:55.090> starts<00:02:55.420> go<00:02:55.600> over<00:02:55.900> 12<00:02:56.799> k

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
to 98 96 think both starts go over 12 k
