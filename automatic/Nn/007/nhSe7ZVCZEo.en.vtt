00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
over a more than one time period we

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.840 
over a more than one time period we
start<00:02:06.869> the<00:02:07.049> story<00:02:07.290> actually<00:02:07.649> shortly<00:02:08.549> after

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:08.850 
start the story actually shortly after

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:10.759 
start the story actually shortly after
the<00:02:09.030> opening<00:02:09.269> events<00:02:09.600> of<00:02:09.720> Killzone<00:02:10.110> warm<00:02:10.410> and

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:10.769 
the opening events of Killzone warm and

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:12.770 
the opening events of Killzone warm and
then<00:02:10.979> the<00:02:11.160> story<00:02:11.489> itself<00:02:11.790> actually<00:02:12.060> expands

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
then the story itself actually expands

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.350 
then the story itself actually expands
into<00:02:13.170> a<00:02:13.380> cruise<00:02:13.829> own<00:02:14.010> food<00:02:14.400> it's<00:02:14.940> designed<00:02:15.090> to

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
into a cruise own food it's designed to

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.420 
into a cruise own food it's designed to
sort<00:02:15.630> of<00:02:15.720> interweave<00:02:16.470> between<00:02:16.920> the<00:02:17.100> events

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
sort of interweave between the events

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.030 
sort of interweave between the events
that<00:02:17.489> kills<00:02:17.730> them<00:02:17.910> to<00:02:18.120> feed<00:02:18.600> into

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
that kills them to feed into

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.649 
that kills them to feed into
storyline<00:02:20.610> and<00:02:21.000> we<00:02:21.120> really<00:02:21.360> wanted<00:02:21.599> to

00:02:21.649 --> 00:02:21.659
