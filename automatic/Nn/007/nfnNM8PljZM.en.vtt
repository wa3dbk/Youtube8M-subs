 carry a simple logo but they have not 

00:00:10.049 --> 00:00:12.599
 responded animal to those of the 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.620

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.620
 good good 

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:19.770
 rhythm change by Alberto contador 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.080
 going from the cows of the last two 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.660
 miles of big plate to see things 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:29.450
 that stores will choose and choose well 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.450
 and it really is very powerful 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:38.600
 and sing the runners at the moment dani 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:40.340
 Brunette that keeps holding and carrying 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.399
 the small group of alejandro valverde if the 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:46.239
 air will paint 

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:46.239
 opening hollow float 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.390
 runners that was there in the leak 

00:00:49.409 --> 00:00:53.190
 you have to put the small plate of 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.629
 baradero attention and ifrán that also 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.250
 reacts always Rodriguez too 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:01.100
 come out nice to your wheel 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.620
 it was costing him valverde was 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.000
 costing 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:07.000
 Alberto who is finding by the 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:13.570
 hardest part of the ascent 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:13.570
 we are seeing a change of pace 

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:19.390
 Rodriguez and with the painter about to 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.690
 seeking to neutralize the counter as 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:21.690
 He said 

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:26.140
 we are already seeing entering 

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:38.050
 counter what is now rising very 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:42.170
 very fast in pursuit of the corridor 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:44.659
 madrileño of the set 5 exact 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:47.280
 because you're selling chris froome that 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:49.960
 stay with Alejandro Valverde 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:53.560
 back but wants to go to victory 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:55.930
 and in the victory of the Colombian 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:58.149
 stage victory for winner anacona and 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:59.830
 let's see the times now for the 

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:02.550
 leadership 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:02.550
 Alberto 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:11.459
 three seconds of difference between 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.040
 accountant and nairo so between them they 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:15.690
 will probably be a leader but 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.870
 there changes again now alberto 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:22.010
 change again 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:23.750
 another change of pace with people with the 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.989
 motorcycle and there in that area now with the 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:25.989
 Colombian 

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:30.250
 you are welcome 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.850
 stage 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:47.120
 and in this step and what there is 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:49.230
 this last kilometers can allow you 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:53.450
 not even re-enter 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.450
 the last kilometer to the inside 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:01.290
 the big plate looking though here already 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:03.510
 it's more normal but the speed of this 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:06.150
 very high figure here a small break 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:07.740
 at this roundabout it was a little relief from 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:10.670
 that pedal was this attention that was 

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:14.840
 giving his muscles but what he says 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:14.840
 meet with your partner organ 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:20.640
 Knowing how to benefit well 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:25.040
 Yesterday he knew how to get carried away by the guides 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:27.200
 he has not met there with the Katyusha 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:31.840
 well let's see how long they cross 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:31.840
 these runners the finish line 

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:40.860
 Alberto in the final straight if there is not going to be 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:43.230
 enough for the leadership and remember 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:45.840
 that there are three seconds between joining the 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:48.510
 counter is also tightening the 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:50.250
 from Madrid to see if he can be the leader 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:53.580
 from the cyclist back to Spain what a great 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:55.959
 way is sir to get to rest 

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:58.569
 always brave the first of the 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:04:00.489
 good at attacking and there you can get 

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:02.380
 your goal is who is trying 

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:03.700
 sprint there also in the final part 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:05.260
 there must be three seconds of 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:07.959
 difference so that the counter is the 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:11.190
 leader of the round will not see the 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:13.050
 Real events are going to be placed as a leader 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:16.260
 there they will give everyone the same 

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:18.090
 time and quintana is going to be placed as 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.329
 New leader of the cycling tour Spain 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:22.109

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:22.109

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:30.050
 and alejandro valverde 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:36.270
 35 will be very little 

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:43.780
 accountant and valverde 

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:46.560
 to get to the law for him but valverde 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:49.860

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:52.490
 valverde 

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:56.920
