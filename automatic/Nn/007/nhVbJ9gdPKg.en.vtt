00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
um I thought it was probably one of the

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.029 
um I thought it was probably one of the
hardest<00:00:26.939> groups<00:00:27.210> aight<00:00:28.199> why<00:00:28.439> patients<00:00:28.680> first

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
hardest groups aight why patients first

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:30.380

thought I'm gonna try this and it works

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.880 
thought I'm gonna try this and it works
every<00:00:40.680> time<00:00:41.600> ok<00:00:42.600> that's<00:00:43.079> really<00:00:43.260> amazing<00:00:43.590> it

reminds<00:00:44.489> me<00:00:44.579> a<00:00:44.670> little<00:00:44.789> bit<00:00:44.910> on<00:00:45.090> grubby<00:00:45.329> he

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
reminds me a little bit on grubby he

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.600 
reminds me a little bit on grubby he
sometimes<00:00:46.140> did<00:00:46.440> that<00:00:46.590> in<00:00:46.770> warcraft<00:00:47.190> 3<00:00:47.370> like

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
sometimes did that in warcraft 3 like

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.520 
sometimes did that in warcraft 3 like
pulling<00:00:48.420> out<00:00:48.539> some<00:00:48.780> strategies<00:00:49.110> he<00:00:49.230> never

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
pulling out some strategies he never

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.700 
pulling out some strategies he never
played<00:00:49.829> before<00:00:49.950> and<00:00:50.190> then<00:00:50.370> it<00:00:50.489> worked<00:00:50.700> at<00:00:50.910> wcg

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:51.710 
played before and then it worked at wcg

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:54.170 
played before and then it worked at wcg
so<00:00:52.710> this<00:00:52.860> is<00:00:52.890> a<00:00:53.039> very<00:00:53.309> good<00:00:53.460> start<00:00:53.820> for<00:00:54.030> you<00:00:54.090> in
