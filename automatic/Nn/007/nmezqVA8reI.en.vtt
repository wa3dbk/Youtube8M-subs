crammed with cream and jam so to start
off<00:00:13.530> with<00:00:13.769> we<00:00:13.889> need<00:00:14.040> to<00:00:14.130> heat<00:00:14.370> our<00:00:14.519> milk<00:00:14.910> to

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
off with we need to heat our milk to

off with we need to heat our milk to
about<00:00:15.330> blood<00:00:15.690> temperature<00:00:15.929> we<00:00:16.680> don't<00:00:16.890> want<00:00:17.010> to

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
about blood temperature we don't want to

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.700 
about blood temperature we don't want to
boil<00:00:17.369> the<00:00:17.789> milk<00:00:18.029> if<00:00:18.690> we<00:00:18.840> add<00:00:18.930> too<00:00:19.230> much<00:00:19.439> heat

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
boil the milk if we add too much heat

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.080 
boil the milk if we add too much heat
it's<00:00:19.859> just<00:00:20.070> gonna<00:00:20.160> kill<00:00:20.490> the<00:00:20.670> yeast<00:00:20.730> and<00:00:21.000> we're

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
it's just gonna kill the yeast and we're

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:22.640 
it's just gonna kill the yeast and we're
not<00:00:21.240> going<00:00:21.449> to<00:00:21.510> get<00:00:21.660> that<00:00:21.779> beautiful<00:00:22.350> light

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
not going to get that beautiful light

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.380 
not going to get that beautiful light
and<00:00:22.680> fluffy<00:00:22.980> texture<00:00:23.580> so<00:00:24.000> whilst<00:00:24.210> that's

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
and fluffy texture so whilst that's

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.029 
and fluffy texture so whilst that's
coming<00:00:24.750> up<00:00:24.840> to<00:00:24.960> temperature<00:00:25.170> we<00:00:25.619> can<00:00:25.650> just

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
coming up to temperature we can just

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.519 
coming up to temperature we can just
sieve<00:00:26.310> our<00:00:26.550> strong<00:00:26.970> white<00:00:27.390> bread<00:00:27.689> flour<00:00:27.960> so<00:00:28.500> we

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
sieve our strong white bread flour so we

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.349 
sieve our strong white bread flour so we
want<00:00:28.830> to<00:00:28.920> try<00:00:29.099> and<00:00:29.189> get<00:00:29.279> as<00:00:29.400> much<00:00:29.730> lightness

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
want to try and get as much lightness

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.810 
want to try and get as much lightness
into<00:00:30.810> our<00:00:30.929> buns<00:00:31.170> as<00:00:31.380> possible<00:00:31.920> so<00:00:32.309> hence<00:00:32.610> why

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
into our buns as possible so hence why

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.850 
into our buns as possible so hence why
I'm<00:00:32.910> saving<00:00:33.300> it<00:00:33.390> from<00:00:33.510> a<00:00:33.660> nice<00:00:33.899> height<00:00:34.200> and<00:00:34.590> of

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
I'm saving it from a nice height and of

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.290 
I'm saving it from a nice height and of
course<00:00:35.070> we<00:00:35.160> don't<00:00:35.340> want<00:00:35.460> any<00:00:35.550> lumps<00:00:35.880> in<00:00:36.090> there

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
course we don't want any lumps in there

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.510 
course we don't want any lumps in there
we<00:00:36.870> now<00:00:37.020> need<00:00:37.230> to<00:00:37.260> add<00:00:37.350> three<00:00:37.860> very<00:00:38.219> special

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
we now need to add three very special

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.340 
we now need to add three very special
ingredients<00:00:39.210> into<00:00:39.360> this<00:00:39.600> bun<00:00:39.840> dough<00:00:40.079> we've

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
ingredients into this bun dough we've

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.229 
ingredients into this bun dough we've
got<00:00:40.559> dried<00:00:40.890> yeast<00:00:41.160> that<00:00:41.550> I'm<00:00:41.670> going<00:00:41.850> to<00:00:41.910> put<00:00:42.090> on

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
got dried yeast that I'm going to put on

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:43.970 
got dried yeast that I'm going to put on
that<00:00:42.420> side<00:00:42.719> of<00:00:42.989> the<00:00:43.140> bowl<00:00:43.320> we've<00:00:43.649> got<00:00:43.800> some

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
that side of the bowl we've got some

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.560 
that side of the bowl we've got some
salts<00:00:44.399> and<00:00:44.610> that<00:00:44.820> I'm<00:00:45.030> going<00:00:45.180> to<00:00:45.239> put<00:00:45.360> on<00:00:45.420> this

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
salts and that I'm going to put on this

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.209 
salts and that I'm going to put on this
side<00:00:45.750> of<00:00:45.930> the<00:00:45.989> bowl<00:00:46.170> and<00:00:46.350> the<00:00:46.530> reason<00:00:47.010> for<00:00:47.160> that

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
side of the bowl and the reason for that

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.250 
side of the bowl and the reason for that
is<00:00:47.520> if<00:00:47.730> we<00:00:47.910> add<00:00:48.059> the<00:00:48.300> salt<00:00:48.600> and<00:00:48.870> the<00:00:49.079> yeast

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
is if we add the salt and the yeast

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.380 
is if we add the salt and the yeast
together<00:00:49.680> the<00:00:50.100> salt<00:00:50.399> is<00:00:50.520> just<00:00:50.550> gonna<00:00:50.910> kill<00:00:51.239> the

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
together the salt is just gonna kill the

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:52.880 
together the salt is just gonna kill the
yeast<00:00:51.629> so<00:00:51.840> we<00:00:51.930> don't<00:00:52.140> want<00:00:52.350> to<00:00:52.410> do<00:00:52.500> that<00:00:52.680> either

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
yeast so we don't want to do that either

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.220 
yeast so we don't want to do that either
and<00:00:53.190> then<00:00:53.399> finally<00:00:53.879> some<00:00:54.090> sugar<00:00:54.390> which<00:00:54.750> in<00:00:54.989> the

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
and then finally some sugar which in the

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.750 
and then finally some sugar which in the
dough<00:00:55.379> is<00:00:55.530> going<00:00:55.680> to<00:00:55.800> feed<00:00:56.070> the<00:00:56.250> yeast<00:00:56.430> and

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
dough is going to feed the yeast and

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.060 
dough is going to feed the yeast and
give<00:00:56.910> it<00:00:57.000> a<00:00:57.059> really<00:00:57.449> lovely<00:00:57.719> light<00:00:58.350> explosion

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
give it a really lovely light explosion

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.400 
give it a really lovely light explosion
let's<00:00:59.399> just<00:00:59.640> check<00:00:59.850> on<00:01:00.059> our<00:01:00.210> milk<00:01:00.510> so<00:01:00.930> once<00:01:01.140> our

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
let's just check on our milk so once our

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.920 
let's just check on our milk so once our
milk<00:01:01.739> slightly<00:01:02.609> warm<00:01:02.820> through<00:01:03.149> we<00:01:03.600> can<00:01:03.750> just

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
milk slightly warm through we can just

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.440 
milk slightly warm through we can just
add<00:01:04.110> it<00:01:04.350> into<00:01:04.860> our<00:01:05.010> flour<00:01:05.580> salt<00:01:05.909> sugar<00:01:06.030> and

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
add it into our flour salt sugar and

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
yeast I'm also going to add some melted

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.920 
yeast I'm also going to add some melted
butter<00:01:08.520> I'm<00:01:09.150> just<00:01:09.299> gonna<00:01:09.390> add<00:01:09.600> a<00:01:09.630> nice<00:01:09.869> little

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
butter I'm just gonna add a nice little

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.750 
butter I'm just gonna add a nice little
touch<00:01:10.380> of<00:01:10.560> richness<00:01:10.920> in<00:01:11.100> there<00:01:11.310> and<00:01:11.580> then

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
touch of richness in there and then

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.399 
touch of richness in there and then
choosing<00:01:12.030> a<00:01:12.270> little<00:01:12.630> rounded<00:01:12.930> knife<00:01:13.080> I'm<00:01:13.260> just

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
choosing a little rounded knife I'm just

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.380 
choosing a little rounded knife I'm just
gonna<00:01:13.500> mix<00:01:13.770> that<00:01:13.979> together<00:01:14.159> from<00:01:14.790> the<00:01:14.880> center

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
gonna mix that together from the center

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.170 
gonna mix that together from the center
outwards<00:01:15.930> slowly<00:01:16.650> bringing<00:01:17.070> in<00:01:17.430> a<00:01:17.670> little<00:01:18.030> bit

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
outwards slowly bringing in a little bit

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.510 
outwards slowly bringing in a little bit
more<00:01:18.420> and<00:01:18.720> then<00:01:19.020> what<00:01:19.320> we<00:01:19.439> can<00:01:19.560> do<00:01:19.799> is<00:01:20.130> once<00:01:20.369> it

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
more and then what we can do is once it

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.190 
more and then what we can do is once it
starts<00:01:20.790> to<00:01:20.880> form<00:01:21.119> a<00:01:21.210> dough<00:01:21.390> just<00:01:21.869> get<00:01:22.080> our

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
starts to form a dough just get our

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.810 
starts to form a dough just get our
hands<00:01:22.470> in<00:01:22.650> there<00:01:22.680> to<00:01:23.009> get<00:01:23.130> all<00:01:23.189> those<00:01:23.490> bits

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
hands in there to get all those bits

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.080 
hands in there to get all those bits
added<00:01:24.150> into<00:01:24.750> it<00:01:24.900> and<00:01:25.619> now<00:01:26.430> comes<00:01:26.759> the<00:01:26.880> stage

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
added into it and now comes the stage

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.640 
added into it and now comes the stage
that<00:01:27.270> we<00:01:27.360> work<00:01:27.509> all<00:01:27.659> kneading<00:01:28.170> we're<00:01:28.439> going<00:01:28.590> to

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
that we work all kneading we're going to

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:52.070 
because it would just get even more

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:53.620 
because it would just get even more
soggy<00:01:52.369> if<00:01:52.670> you<00:01:52.759> just<00:01:52.909> add<00:01:53.090> a<00:01:53.119> little<00:01:53.210> bit<00:01:53.509> of

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:58.340 
hands against each other or it comes

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.730

straight off your hands not clog up the
sink<00:02:01.009> it's<00:02:01.610> a<00:02:01.700> lot<00:02:01.909> easier<00:02:02.330> to<00:02:02.810> go<00:02:02.960> and<00:02:03.080> clean

00:02:03.249 --> 00:02:03.259 
sink it's a lot easier to go and clean

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:08.259 
sink it's a lot easier to go and clean
them<00:02:05.380> so<00:02:06.380> now<00:02:06.560> that<00:02:06.619> our<00:02:06.830> dough<00:02:07.490> has<00:02:07.789> finished

want to crush all that air out just by

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:59.270 
want to crush all that air out just by
punching<00:02:58.019> the<00:02:58.079> down<00:02:58.290> you<00:02:58.409> can<00:02:58.560> see<00:02:58.829> that<00:02:59.159> it

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
punching the down you can see that it

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.819 
punching the down you can see that it
starts<00:02:59.730> to<00:03:00.090> fall<00:03:00.510> back<00:03:00.750> taking<00:03:01.409> a<00:03:01.530> little<00:03:01.709> bit

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:01.829 
starts to fall back taking a little bit

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:04.309 
starts to fall back taking a little bit
of<00:03:01.980> flour<00:03:02.250> on<00:03:02.579> our<00:03:02.730> board<00:03:03.360> we<00:03:03.780> can<00:03:03.900> tip<00:03:04.140> that

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:04.319 
of flour on our board we can tip that

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:06.530 
of flour on our board we can tip that
out<00:03:04.500> I'm<00:03:04.890> just<00:03:05.099> gonna<00:03:05.220> not<00:03:05.670> that<00:03:05.879> that<00:03:06.060> ever<00:03:06.120> so

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
out I'm just gonna not that that ever so

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:09.289 
out I'm just gonna not that that ever so
slightly<00:03:06.840> so<00:03:07.409> it's<00:03:07.590> easier<00:03:08.099> to<00:03:08.280> mold<00:03:08.489> so<00:03:09.239> you

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:09.299 
slightly so it's easier to mold so you

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:10.819 
slightly so it's easier to mold so you
want<00:03:09.480> to<00:03:09.540> make<00:03:09.659> about<00:03:09.780> 12<00:03:10.260> so<00:03:10.680> we're<00:03:10.799> just
