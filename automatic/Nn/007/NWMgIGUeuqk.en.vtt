now<00:00:22.740> just<00:00:23.010> for<00:00:23.130> fun<00:00:23.340> let's<00:00:23.369> see<00:00:23.640> we<00:00:23.789> can<00:00:23.880> figure

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
now just for fun let's see we can figure

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.060 
now just for fun let's see we can figure
out<00:00:24.240> about<00:00:24.390> this<00:00:24.750> record<00:00:25.230> first<00:00:25.890> of<00:00:26.039> all

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
out about this record first of all

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.439 
out about this record first of all
notice<00:00:26.279> we<00:00:26.460> have<00:00:26.490> some<00:00:26.849> different<00:00:27.180> parts<00:00:27.420> of

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
notice we have some different parts of

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.419 
notice we have some different parts of
the<00:00:27.510> record<00:00:27.840> interval<00:00:28.140> shiny<00:00:28.410> here<00:00:28.769> all<00:00:29.310> right

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
the record interval shiny here all right

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.880 
the record interval shiny here all right
looks<00:00:30.240> like<00:00:30.330> a<00:00:30.420> matte<00:00:30.630> finish<00:00:30.660> here<00:00:31.260> but<00:00:31.740> then

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
looks like a matte finish here but then

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.470 
looks like a matte finish here but then
you<00:00:32.009> see<00:00:32.219> these<00:00:32.340> little<00:00:32.520> spaces<00:00:32.910> here<00:00:33.300> and

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
you see these little spaces here and

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.930 
you see these little spaces here and
there<00:00:33.630> they're<00:00:34.559> not<00:00:34.680> really<00:00:35.250> shiny<00:00:35.700> but

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
there they're not really shiny but

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.700 
there they're not really shiny but
they're<00:00:36.090> shinier<00:00:36.480> than<00:00:36.870> the<00:00:37.110> matte<00:00:37.410> finish

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
they're shinier than the matte finish

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.610 
they're shinier than the matte finish
part<00:00:37.920> that<00:00:38.219> you're<00:00:38.370> seeing<00:00:38.520> here<00:00:38.730> so<00:00:39.030> we<00:00:39.239> have

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:39.620 
part that you're seeing here so we have

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:43.130 
part that you're seeing here so we have
12<00:00:40.620> looks<00:00:41.579> like<00:00:41.640> three<00:00:41.969> of<00:00:42.000> those<00:00:42.180> and<00:00:42.450> then<00:00:43.050> it

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
12 looks like three of those and then it

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.380 
12 looks like three of those and then it
gets<00:00:43.230> real<00:00:43.680> shiny<00:00:44.040> again<00:00:44.219> what<00:00:45.210> do<00:00:45.270> you<00:00:45.300> think

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
gets real shiny again what do you think

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.630 
gets real shiny again what do you think
that<00:00:45.750> is<00:00:45.960> well<00:00:46.800> where<00:00:47.190> it's<00:00:47.309> a<00:00:47.399> matte<00:00:47.610> finish

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
that is well where it's a matte finish

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.670 
that is well where it's a matte finish
that's<00:00:48.510> where<00:00:48.750> there's<00:00:49.079> a<00:00:49.140> lot<00:00:49.260> of<00:00:49.289> music

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
that's where there's a lot of music

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.700 
that's where there's a lot of music
happening<00:00:50.100> where<00:00:51.090> you<00:00:51.120> see<00:00:51.300> a<00:00:51.809> shiny<00:00:52.379> bit

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
happening where you see a shiny bit

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.160 
happening where you see a shiny bit
that's<00:00:53.370> either<00:00:53.520> nothing<00:00:53.879> and<00:00:54.239> then<00:00:54.989> there's

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
that's either nothing and then there's

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.660 
that's either nothing and then there's
bits<00:00:55.410> here<00:00:55.620> where<00:00:55.829> they're<00:00:55.949> not<00:00:56.070> as<00:00:56.309> shiny<00:00:56.550> as

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
bits here where they're not as shiny as

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.939 
bits here where they're not as shiny as
the<00:00:56.820> matte<00:00:56.940> finish<00:00:57.270> that's<00:00:57.960> probably<00:00:58.530> a<00:00:58.620> break

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
the matte finish that's probably a break

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.880 
the matte finish that's probably a break
like<00:00:59.100> an<00:00:59.250> acapella<00:00:59.760> or<00:01:00.000> something<00:01:00.390> so<00:01:01.260> let's

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
like an acapella or something so let's

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.110 
like an acapella or something so let's
see<00:01:02.039> if<00:01:02.160> I'm<00:01:02.250> right<00:01:02.280> let's<00:01:02.670> put<00:01:02.820> the<00:01:02.879> needle<00:01:03.090> on

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
see if I'm right let's put the needle on

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.960 
see if I'm right let's put the needle on
the<00:01:03.210> record<00:01:03.359> and<00:01:03.979> let's<00:01:04.979> go<00:01:05.070> ahead<00:01:05.220> and<00:01:05.460> jump

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
the record and let's go ahead and jump

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.170 
the record and let's go ahead and jump
into<00:01:06.180> you<00:01:07.080> know<00:01:07.200> what<00:01:07.380> we<00:01:07.500> think<00:01:07.740> might<00:01:07.950> be<00:01:08.180> the

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
into you know what we think might be the

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:17.010 
into you know what we think might be the
matte<00:01:09.750> finish<00:01:10.110> right<00:01:10.380> before<00:01:10.770> the<00:01:11.070> break

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:17.020 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:23.290 

it<00:01:18.020> comes<00:01:18.230> that<00:01:18.470> break<00:01:21.220> sure<00:01:22.220> enough<00:01:22.430> check

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:23.300 
it comes that break sure enough check

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:26.950 
it comes that break sure enough check
that<00:01:23.450> out<00:01:23.920> now<00:01:24.920> it's<00:01:25.070> not<00:01:25.220> very<00:01:25.340> long<00:01:25.960> it's

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:26.960 
that out now it's not very long it's

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.040 
that out now it's not very long it's
going<00:01:27.110> to<00:01:27.170> kick<00:01:27.320> back<00:01:27.470> in<00:01:28.750> and<00:01:29.750> there<00:01:29.900> you<00:01:29.990> are

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:30.050 
going to kick back in and there you are

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:31.600 
going to kick back in and there you are
expecting<00:01:30.650> the<00:01:30.740> music<00:01:31.010> so<00:01:31.160> you're<00:01:31.280> back<00:01:31.430> to

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:31.610 
expecting the music so you're back to

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:35.680 
expecting the music so you're back to
matte<00:01:32.120> finish<00:01:34.060> look<00:01:35.060> closely<00:01:35.330> over<00:01:35.510> the

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:35.690 
matte finish look closely over the

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:38.490 
matte finish look closely over the
lights<00:01:35.930> reflecting<00:01:36.350> on<00:01:36.440> the<00:01:36.500> record<00:01:37.210> see<00:01:38.210> that

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:38.500 
lights reflecting on the record see that

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.340 
lights reflecting on the record see that
you're<00:01:39.500> getting<00:01:39.710> sleepy<00:01:41.020> it<00:01:42.020> looks<00:01:42.200> like<00:01:42.260> a

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:42.350 
you're getting sleepy it looks like a

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:47.170 
you're getting sleepy it looks like a
buzz<00:01:42.680> saw<00:01:42.710> doesn't<00:01:43.430> it<00:01:43.570> this<00:01:44.570> record<00:01:44.960> is<00:01:46.180> 120

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:47.180 
buzz saw doesn't it this record is 120

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.710 
buzz saw doesn't it this record is 120
BPM<00:01:47.540> and<00:01:47.810> it<00:01:48.260> plays<00:01:48.440> at<00:01:48.590> 45<00:01:49.040> rpm<00:01:49.550> and<00:01:49.730> that's

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:50.720 
BPM and it plays at 45 rpm and that's

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:51.580 
BPM and it plays at 45 rpm and that's
what<00:01:50.870> it<00:01:50.930> looks<00:01:51.050> like<00:01:51.140> when<00:01:51.290> it's<00:01:51.440> spinning

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.590 
what it looks like when it's spinning

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:52.990 
what it looks like when it's spinning
around<00:01:51.800> but<00:01:52.220> if<00:01:52.310> we<00:01:52.400> go<00:01:52.520> ahead<00:01:52.580> and<00:01:52.670> slow<00:01:52.880> it

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000 
around but if we go ahead and slow it

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.740 
around but if we go ahead and slow it
down<00:01:53.230> we<00:01:54.230> can<00:01:54.410> see<00:01:54.560> that<00:01:54.590> buzz<00:01:54.980> saw<00:01:55.690> you<00:01:56.690> should

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:56.750 
down we can see that buzz saw you should
