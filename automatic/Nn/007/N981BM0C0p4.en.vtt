00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 For 60 years there was this cup of how 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:07.370
 ever here at the hamburger 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:11.790
 At that time Hanover 96 was victorious today 

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:14.120
 win at Eintracht Braunschweig 2 to 0 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.120
 at the end 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.660
 after the 4 2 1 against Kaiserslautern 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:21.980
 simply conveys Brunswick to the 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:25.259
 second Bundesliga team from the dfb cup 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:28.430
 the funfair at the hamburger street 

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:28.430
 he keeps going 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:34.220
 yes love to look we are still here 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:38.420
 live at the historical point exactly 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:39.950
 here was at 8 pm 58 and 42 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:41.930
 the derby tonight 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:43.309
 decided now you could of course 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:46.190
 look forward to this surprise 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:48.320
 that would turn out the reactions and 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:50.600
 my colleague has been around first 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.010
 Winner looked after and there you have to say 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.540
 they behaved a bit like that 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:57.370
 as if you had card game lost it 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:57.370
 was scary quiet party gossip please 

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:03.440
 By the way, this is the cabin of the 

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:17.750
 winners even if they are all the same 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:19.940
 They would have liked to have noticed 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:22.040
 every 23,000 spectators individual 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:24.820
 clapped 2 0 victory and that in the 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.820
 traditional derby 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:38.440
 to play accordingly belongs to 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:40.150
 I already think that we win 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:42.430
 players know what explosiveness in this 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:44.290
 play and the fans here for years 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:45.790
 living or being born here is 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:47.440
 of course one more tick but me 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:49.090
 We believe we showed that 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:51.070
 understood the important game for you 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.350
 is and of course for us and of course 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:55.060
 actually also for Hannover 96 after 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:57.010
 this embarrassment at the regional alligist 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:59.020
 skid too fast into the crisis 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:02.190
 Of course, the crucial factor was the early goal 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:04.720
 After part time, that's what the industry has to offer 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:08.649
 properly brought to a boil 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:10.660
 and she was not able to score 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:12.910
 shoot four of us have five players 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:15.010
 Everything is going on over the entire game 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.570
 also try for that 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.970
 to claim 100 percent 

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:21.190
 but unfortunately only four or 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:24.070
 five and one opponent think I have all 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:25.450
 everything tried Brunswick has think 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:27.340
 I played at the limit at all 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:28.300
 positions and that's why they are 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:30.660
 In the end, I also think deserves 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:30.660
 enforced 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:40.430
 the press conference tried the 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:42.190
 trainer the angry 96 fans too 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:45.049
 soothe 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:48.970
 The manager does not say anything at all 

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:48.970
 The Brunswickers wanted something completely different 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:06.170
 and what dead rest here in the cabin 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:08.480
 Unbelievable what you can do 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:12.980
 first dead rest and now I have too 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:14.810
 but broken and you have to someday 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:19.250
 we have to exaggerate 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:20.540
 win that is very important and we 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:21.799
 have to offer in the audience that we 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:23.299
 work and also celebrated in the 

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:25.250
 regionalliga and then come the industry 

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:26.829
 also the wish opponent for not so 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:31.730
 in the cup 

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:33.590
 munich I will be very uncomfortable 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:36.849
 would certainly be a Brunswick 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:36.849
 taste really good 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:41.690
 though to pick up the microphone than today 

00:03:39.139 --> 00:03:43.639
 rather for the 96er I would say 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:45.440
 on saturday they have to go to cologne and 

00:03:43.639 --> 00:03:47.599
 if that goes wrong then it can 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:49.489
 Slowly for ralf rangnick too 

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:51.500
 closely are now one was of course 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:54.410
 I was looking forward to that partie 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:56.060
 96 fans that put everything away how would 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:58.190
 they react there was randal in the 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:00.600
 city there was randal around the stadium 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:02.100
 hendrik bacchus please 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:04.470
 extension for the Brunswicks 

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:06.330
 Police over 1000 officials are also 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:09.060
 right after the game in action 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:11.010
 the bulk of Hanoverian fans in 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:13.610
 will be back with buses right now 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:16.470
 drove to Brunswick train station 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:18.000
 coordinated and supervised by the 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:21.060
 command of the police 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:24.120
 today she is sitting directly in the stadium 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:26.250
 first balance sheet of the big mission yes we 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:28.200
 can be very satisfied there were some 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:29.580
 minor property damage in the frame 

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:31.710
 the journey here to the stadium 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:33.240
 Meanwhile, the process has begun 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:35.880
 Hanoverian fans would be returned 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:38.310
 to the station except for a few ripples 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:39.570
 There was no progress on others 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:42.030
 may meet 

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:43.290
 rival fans so far we can 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:44.570
 from the security forces one 

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:46.830
 positive balance 

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:48.990
 just before 10 o'clock and around the stadium 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:52.100
 the police monitors the departure of the police 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:55.770
 Fan groups here everything is quiet 

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:58.680
 other than right on the stadium here 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:05:00.180
 the frustration of the 96 fans is not discharged 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:03.660
 against enemy Brunswick 

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:07.220
 but against the own team of the 

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:07.220
 Coach tries to settle 

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:30.980
 23 o'clock on the Brunswick railway and the 

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:33.890
 last fan train to hannover leaves 

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:36.410
 Only five in custody took this course 

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:40.130
 the positive balance of the police at the end 

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:43.840
 a long day so there is one too 

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:43.840
 very important thing today is everything
