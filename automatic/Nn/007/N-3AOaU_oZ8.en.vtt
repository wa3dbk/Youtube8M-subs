00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:04.440 
know that as soon as you take your body
to<00:02:02.410> failure<00:02:02.740> and<00:02:02.860> actually<00:02:03.819> take<00:02:04.060> it<00:02:04.240> to<00:02:04.330> the

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 
to failure and actually take it to the

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:06.389 
to failure and actually take it to the
limit<00:02:04.750> you<00:02:05.020> know<00:02:05.050> where<00:02:05.380> you<00:02:05.500> physically

00:02:06.389 --> 00:02:06.399 
limit you know where you physically

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:09.990 
limit you know where you physically
cannot<00:02:06.670> do<00:02:06.849> another<00:02:07.060> rep<00:02:08.310> after<00:02:09.310> you<00:02:09.459> hit<00:02:09.819> that

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 
cannot do another rep after you hit that

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.540 
cannot do another rep after you hit that
kind<00:02:10.300> of<00:02:10.450> after<00:02:11.349> you<00:02:11.440> hit<00:02:11.620> that<00:02:11.740> failure<00:02:12.010> it's

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
kind of after you hit that failure it's

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:14.880 
kind of after you hit that failure it's
very<00:02:12.910> hard<00:02:13.240> to<00:02:13.330> keep<00:02:13.569> that<00:02:13.840> strength<00:02:14.110> so<00:02:14.380> you

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
very hard to keep that strength so you

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.040 
very hard to keep that strength so you
know<00:02:15.220> if<00:02:15.310> you're<00:02:15.459> doing<00:02:15.550> 275<00:02:16.360> pounds<00:02:16.720> for<00:02:16.840> five

reps<00:02:17.319> and<00:02:17.470> that<00:02:17.590> fifth<00:02:17.860> rep<00:02:18.099> barely<00:02:18.730> barely

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
reps and that fifth rep barely barely

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:20.670 
reps and that fifth rep barely barely
get<00:02:19.240> it<00:02:19.360> chances<00:02:20.050> are<00:02:20.200> you're<00:02:20.349> not<00:02:20.380> gonna<00:02:20.590> be

reps
okay<00:03:19.540> so<00:03:19.659> drop<00:03:19.989> the<00:03:20.170> weight<00:03:20.319> and<00:03:20.560> crease<00:03:20.769> the

reps<00:03:21.010> a<00:03:21.099> little<00:03:21.280> bit<00:03:21.400> my<00:03:21.760> third<00:03:22.090> set<00:03:22.390> I<00:03:22.569> would

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720 
reps a little bit my third set I would

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.930 
reps a little bit my third set I would
go<00:03:22.840> about<00:03:23.110> eight<00:03:23.379> to<00:03:23.620> ten<00:03:23.860> and<00:03:24.129> then<00:03:24.579> my<00:03:24.670> fourth

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940 
go about eight to ten and then my fourth

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:26.729 
go about eight to ten and then my fourth
set<00:03:25.180> I<00:03:25.209> would<00:03:25.390> go<00:03:25.540> about<00:03:25.750> eight<00:03:26.019> to<00:03:26.230> twelve<00:03:26.440> ish

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:26.739 
set I would go about eight to twelve ish

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:28.110 
set I would go about eight to twelve ish
so<00:03:26.890> kind<00:03:27.099> of<00:03:27.190> depending<00:03:27.519> on<00:03:27.579> the<00:03:27.640> movement<00:03:27.849> I

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.120 
so kind of depending on the movement I

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:29.430 
so kind of depending on the movement I
would<00:03:28.239> either<00:03:28.329> go<00:03:28.870> a<00:03:28.900> little<00:03:29.079> bit<00:03:29.230> higher<00:03:29.379> you

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:29.440 
would either go a little bit higher you

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.130

00:04:27.659 --> 00:04:27.669 
pushing and keep doing that movement and

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:29.790 
pushing and keep doing that movement and
getting<00:04:27.789> better<00:04:28.000> at<00:04:28.180> it<00:04:28.330> so<00:04:28.360> my<00:04:28.990> PR<00:04:29.349> on<00:04:29.470> that<00:04:29.650> is
