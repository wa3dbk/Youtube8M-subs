stay<00:02:39.590> well<00:02:39.770> out<00:02:39.800> of<00:02:39.890> the<00:02:40.010> way<00:02:40.130> because<00:02:40.190> we<00:02:40.490> can

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610 
stay well out of the way because we can

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:56.970 
stay well out of the way because we can
catch<00:02:40.760> up<00:02:40.910> with<00:02:41.030> my<00:02:41.150> hope<00:02:41.680> try<00:02:42.680> to<00:02:42.740> stay<00:02:43.040> back

it looks me

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:02.559 
it looks me
it's<00:03:01.370> being<00:03:01.550> a<00:03:01.610> bit<00:03:01.760> more<00:03:01.880> ferocious<00:03:02.030> for<00:03:02.510> the

00:03:02.559 --> 00:03:02.569
