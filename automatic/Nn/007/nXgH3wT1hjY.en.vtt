Kabbalah<00:00:22.740> bards<00:00:23.160> decently<00:00:23.880> strong<00:00:24.390> autotext

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
Kabbalah bards decently strong autotext

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:26.810 
Kabbalah bards decently strong autotext
and<00:00:25.410> if<00:00:25.500> you<00:00:25.560> want<00:00:25.769> to<00:00:25.800> queue<00:00:26.039> on<00:00:26.160> you<00:00:26.279> you're

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
and if you want to queue on you you're

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.040 
and if you want to queue on you you're
gonna<00:00:26.910> take<00:00:27.029> a<00:00:27.090> lot<00:00:27.300> of<00:00:27.330> chunk<00:00:27.570> damage<00:00:27.840> and

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
gonna take a lot of chunk damage and

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.019 
gonna take a lot of chunk damage and
especially<00:00:28.410> because<00:00:28.769> close<00:00:29.130> just<00:00:29.519> does<00:00:29.730> a<00:00:29.760> lot

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
especially because close just does a lot

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.510 
especially because close just does a lot
of<00:00:30.090> damage<00:00:30.300> if<00:00:30.570> I'm<00:00:31.170> maybe<00:00:31.920> let<00:00:32.160> her<00:00:32.219> order<00:00:32.369> you

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
of damage if I'm maybe let her order you

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.940 
of damage if I'm maybe let her order you
so<00:00:33.000> definitely<00:00:33.989> a<00:00:34.079> strong<00:00:34.350> Lane<00:00:34.620> in<00:00:34.739> solo

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
so definitely a strong Lane in solo

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.250 
so definitely a strong Lane in solo
queue<00:00:35.130> and<00:00:35.340> it's<00:00:35.730> super<00:00:36.090> reliant<00:00:36.570> on<00:00:36.630> getting

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
queue and it's super reliant on getting

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.900 
queue and it's super reliant on getting
the<00:00:37.410> good<00:00:37.620> autos<00:00:37.920> in<00:00:37.950> there<00:00:38.190> and<00:00:38.370> just<00:00:38.730> not

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
the good autos in there and just not

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.369 
the good autos in there and just not
getting<00:00:39.120> see<00:00:39.480> see<00:00:39.629> that<00:00:39.780> getting<00:00:39.870> hooked<00:00:40.170> or

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
getting see see that getting hooked or

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:41.959 
getting see see that getting hooked or
gaining<00:00:40.559> gauge<00:00:40.829> on<00:00:41.100> as<00:00:41.309> you're<00:00:41.730> trying<00:00:41.850> to

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
gaining gauge on as you're trying to

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.229 
gaining gauge on as you're trying to
poke<00:00:42.180> them<00:00:42.329> so<00:00:43.050> bark<00:00:43.800> alyssa<00:00:44.219> is<00:00:44.700> a<00:00:44.820> fairly

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
poke them so bark alyssa is a fairly

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.090 
poke them so bark alyssa is a fairly
strange<00:00:45.539> combo<00:00:46.079> the<00:00:46.379> way<00:00:46.469> they<00:00:46.620> work<00:00:46.829> is<00:00:47.039> that

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
strange combo the way they work is that

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.549 
strange combo the way they work is that
this<00:00:47.760> is<00:00:47.820> fairly<00:00:48.300> good<00:00:48.480> at<00:00:48.510> poking<00:00:48.989> and<00:00:49.110> bart

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
this is fairly good at poking and bart

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.560 
this is fairly good at poking and bart
is<00:00:49.710> pretty<00:00:50.070> good<00:00:50.129> at<00:00:50.250> pocono<00:00:50.610> as<00:00:50.700> well<00:00:50.850> decent

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
is pretty good at pocono as well decent

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.299 
is pretty good at pocono as well decent
range<00:00:51.750> n<00:00:51.960> bar<00:00:52.260> could<00:00:52.410> provide<00:00:52.680> some<00:00:52.739> sustained

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
range n bar could provide some sustained

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.850 
range n bar could provide some sustained
and<00:00:53.610> then<00:00:54.149> once<00:00:54.480> they<00:00:54.750> hit<00:00:54.870> six<00:00:55.140> part<00:00:55.620> is

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
and then once they hit six part is

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.369 
and then once they hit six part is
pretty<00:00:56.280> strong<00:00:56.640> in<00:00:56.879> initiating<00:00:57.449> fight<00:00:57.780> close

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
pretty strong in initiating fight close

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.200 
pretty strong in initiating fight close
also<00:00:58.680> get<00:00:58.829> a<00:00:58.859> saving<00:00:59.250> bar<00:00:59.430> because<00:00:59.730> bart<00:01:00.059> is

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
also get a saving bar because bart is

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.389 
also get a saving bar because bart is
very<00:01:00.570> he's<00:01:01.410> very<00:01:01.500> easy<00:01:01.770> to<00:01:01.890> kill<00:01:02.039> he's<00:01:02.340> very

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
very he's very easy to kill he's very

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.520 
very he's very easy to kill he's very
bubbly<00:01:02.730> and<00:01:03.059> he's<00:01:03.300> like<00:01:03.629> love<00:01:04.080> killing<00:01:04.290> bar

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
bubbly and he's like love killing bar

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.260 
bubbly and he's like love killing bar
and<00:01:04.680> so<00:01:04.860> having<00:01:05.339> cluster<00:01:05.640> there<00:01:05.790> really<00:01:06.000> helps

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
and so having cluster there really helps

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.140 
and so having cluster there really helps
out<00:01:06.390> Bart<00:01:06.689> do<00:01:07.140> not<00:01:07.260> die<00:01:07.439> as<00:01:07.590> much<00:01:07.770> so<00:01:08.549> lemon<00:01:08.820> 1<00:01:09.000> &amp;

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
out Bart do not die as much so lemon 1 &amp;

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.679 
out Bart do not die as much so lemon 1 &amp;
2<00:01:09.210> bar<00:01:09.869> closes<00:01:10.320> fine<00:01:10.770> um<00:01:11.520> ideally<00:01:12.119> you<00:01:12.390> want<00:01:12.540> to

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.260 
take the jungle camp and just hit level
2<00:01:16.229> quicker<00:01:16.530> but<00:01:17.250> if<00:01:17.340> you<00:01:17.460> don't<00:01:17.670> it's<00:01:17.880> fun<00:01:18.150> as

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270

well I love wanted to just want to use

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.090 
well I love wanted to just want to use
your<00:01:20.729> auto's<00:01:21.000> a<00:01:21.060> lot<00:01:21.390> and<00:01:21.710> try<00:01:22.710> to<00:01:22.770> line<00:01:22.950> your

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
you're in a really good spot as if

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.149 
you're in a really good spot as if
there's<00:01:30.119> a<00:01:30.180> ton<00:01:30.479> of<00:01:30.509> damage<00:01:30.780> at<00:01:31.079> level<00:01:31.710> 2<00:01:31.890> you

there's a ton of damage at level 2 you

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.940 
there's a ton of damage at level 2 you
can<00:01:32.640> look<00:01:32.970> for<00:01:33.090> all<00:01:33.210> ends<00:01:33.450> it's<00:01:33.780> doable<00:01:34.350> but<00:01:34.740> be

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
can look for all ends it's doable but be

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.370 
can look for all ends it's doable but be
careful<00:01:35.520> as<00:01:35.729> bars<00:01:36.240> level<00:01:36.570> 2<00:01:36.750> power<00:01:36.990> spike<00:01:37.229> is

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
careful as bars level 2 power spike is

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.800 
careful as bars level 2 power spike is
more<00:01:37.890> sustained<00:01:38.369> than<00:01:38.729> is<00:01:39.000> an<00:01:39.210> all<00:01:39.360> in<00:01:39.570> a
