 introduce folding knife and selected 

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:18.100
 I have a real classic 

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:20.680
 a celebrity among the pocket knives 

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:23.380
 a Swiss pocket knife from 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:25.360
 victorinox victorinox is like you 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:27.550
 Maybe not only one of them knows 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:30.040
 oldest pocket knife manufacturer of 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:32.739
 still produces but also the largest 

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:35.980
 pocketknife manufacturer of the world in the 

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:37.929
 The factory in Switzerland will be around 60,000 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:40.629
 pocketknives produced per day 

00:00:37.929 --> 00:00:43.179
 mind you the models I give you 

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:45.850
 Present today are newer date and 

00:00:43.179 --> 00:00:48.429
 are a little different than the classic one 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:50.170
 Swiss pocket knives are yours 

00:00:48.429 --> 00:00:54.479
 as features as a one-hand operation 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:54.479
 and a lock 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:04.640
 There are two of the victorinox forrester 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:07.650
 different versions their technical 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:10.380
 data are largely identical 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.370
 the blade length of the knife is 86 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.320
 cm 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:15.330
 she owns the popular drop band 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.550
 sound form with strong good 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.140
 controllable tip and sufficient 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:22.200
 also for cultural achievements 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:26.160
 the blade is almost 2 mm throughout 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:28.140
 wide and 16 inches deep the knife 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:29.960
 offers a highly dressed flat 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.710
 cut a broad range of uses 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:33.900
 covers 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:37.260
 in open state is that forrester 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:39.600
 19 the folding knife becomes 8 cm long 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.440
 closed, its length is 11.1 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.950
 centimeter 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:47.100
 The two hand version weighs 126 grams 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:50.130
 the one-handed version is with 128 grams 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:52.229
 only slightly heavier the victorinox 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.659
 has a millimeter strong lionel 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:57.170
 logue lock a sound game is 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.170
 unavailable 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:07.800
 we come to the material the blade of 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.479
 forrester is made of stainless chrome 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:12.420
 made of molybdenum steel 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:14.760
 the steel and a good sharpness is on 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.650
 easy to do but own only 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:20.010
 a middle cut action and 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:21.780
 Hardness are the handle scales of the knife 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.300
 made of two components 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.670
 They insist on a robust one 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:28.620
 plastic in classic red and for 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:31.040
 others from catchy black 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.040
 hard rubber 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:41.549
 but now in the practice 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:43.260
 Pocketknife of this size is natural 

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:45.840
 not intended for coarser work 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:48.030
 in the field of normal work supplies 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:50.640
 the cushion but very good results 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:52.620
 especially the one hand version with part 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:55.829
 wave grinding allows a very fast 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:58.019
 Both variants are suitable 

00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:59.909
 but also for finer work there 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:02.940
 wave ground only in the upper part of the 

00:02:59.909 --> 00:03:04.560
 blade is attached here makes itself 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:06.140
 the good delivery sheep of the 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.609
 messers noticeable 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:10.739
 next to the blade has the first time 

00:03:08.609 --> 00:03:13.260
 another saw with a very precise 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:14.489
 score a blessing or smaller branches 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:17.129
 cut through 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:17.940
 the back of the saw has a 

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:19.829
 sharp edge 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:21.170
 with the example of a fire strong 

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:23.190
 can be used 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:25.319
 In addition, the Swiss offers 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:27.359
 pocket knife still a wide slit 

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:29.280
 screwdriver with a capsule 

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:30.260
 lift and a wire from insulator 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:32.879
 is provided 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:34.859
 on the other side exists 

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:36.780
 small slotted screwdriver with 

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:39.450
 a can opener is equipped 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:42.000
 at the back of the knife is then another 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:45.120
 corkscrew as well as a sting and rurale 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.609
 attached just the latter is suitable 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:50.720
 Great for smaller holes in one 

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:50.720
 piece of wood to drill 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:04:00.459
 Let's go to the conclusion on the 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:02.110
 Serving a forrester is right 

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:04.959
 good in the hand and is very grip 

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:06.819
 lastingly balanced the knife offers 

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:08.709
 no hand shot and the handle is 

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:11.410
 despite the two components only peel 

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:12.700
 mediocre graphic a cautious 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:14.950
 Dealing with the knife is therefore mandatory 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:16.600
 even if the main blade by one 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:19.480
 lionel logue closure is secured 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:20.919
 the one-handed version can be done by thumb 

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:22.480
 still easily from the right and 

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:24.940
 be used left-handed 

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:27.850
 the liner still closure is on however 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:29.590
 left handed designed the two hand 

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:31.810
 version offers a needle pile 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:34.690
 right-handed and also one for 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:36.610
 left-handed imaginary unfortunately lures am 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:40.150
 the rear end has the victorinox 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:42.010
 a bad one with a round of the effort 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:44.470
 for cleaning and care is because of the 

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:47.070
 Easily retighten stainless steel 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:47.070
 minimal 

00:04:52.189 --> 00:04:57.360
 we come to the conclusion the victorinox 

00:04:55.319 --> 00:04:59.189
 forrester liked it very much 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:01.319
 it is the switzerland with the knife 

00:04:59.189 --> 00:05:03.240
 succeeded the classic of the swiss 

00:05:01.319 --> 00:05:03.839
 pocketknife sent in the modern 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:06.270
 respectively 

00:05:03.839 --> 00:05:08.460
 We especially liked it 

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:10.169
 one of the liners still closure and to 

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:11.789
 others the possibility of the knife 

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:14.009
 to open with one hand 

00:05:11.789 --> 00:05:15.960
 Another highlight is the 

00:05:14.009 --> 00:05:17.309
 Greater grip with the two 

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:19.680
 components now also clearly 

00:05:17.309 --> 00:05:21.240
 are more handy as well 

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:23.009
 also the tools above all things the 

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:25.680
 blade got bigger and that 

00:05:23.009 --> 00:05:26.939
 simplifies many work positively to 

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:28.740
 to emphasize are the others 

00:05:26.939 --> 00:05:31.080
 tools such as the sting 

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:33.419
 and boreal or saw in the 

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:35.729
 Auto everyday are particularly helpful 

00:05:33.419 --> 00:05:37.529
 But there is also a reason to criticize 

00:05:35.729 --> 00:05:38.999
 and that is the liner still closure 

00:05:37.529 --> 00:05:41.400
 the standard for left-handed 

00:05:38.999 --> 00:05:43.889
 is designed is particularly clear 

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:46.199
 the two-hand version of the nail 

00:05:43.889 --> 00:05:48.060
 how right-handed and its one 

00:05:46.199 --> 00:05:50.729
 lok lock intended for left-handers 

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:53.460
 that's it, the knife is still 

00:05:50.729 --> 00:05:56.339
 a recommendation for the autoalltag it 

00:05:53.460 --> 00:06:01.069
 costs in the one-handed version 39 euro 

00:05:56.339 --> 00:06:01.069
 and in the 2 hand version 38 euro
