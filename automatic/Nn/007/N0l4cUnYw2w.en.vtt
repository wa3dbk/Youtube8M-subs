 package is I will paste package but not 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:29.849
 It's certain that the game was released the same

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.719
 others were also modified one of the 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.739
 things that I found most of the time as soon as 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:55.739
 I liked it the most, now that we 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:59.489

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:01.920

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:05.790
 possibility of initiating this 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:08.549
 skills process and the parent 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:11.240
 infinitely, it's the camera angle 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:14.400
 was also changed in some battles 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:16.920
 it is neither a battle nor a new difficulty 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:20.490
 was added to the game that besides it 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:23.250
 nor good legendary so she 's teaching 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.350
 how folks download and install and 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.290
 How I going to show you both here? 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.880
 I 'm not with oscar installed, I'm 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.880
 just I went to my computer makes 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:36.689
 little time and I advise you if you 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:39.570

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.920
 stadiums and me too 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.329
 detail everything about him ceases everything that you 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.640
 already have until now 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:49.979
 uninstall the board is because I think 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.619
 which is much easier but this does not 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:54.570
 means you're going to lose it's your 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:57.930
 My sin is your service, are you mine? 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:02:01.200
 documents more games this is just the game 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:05.610
 even if they exclude pulp and 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:08.190
 in a new one and now I was going to download then 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:11.790
 here it contains the adele game and the update 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:13.380
 1.9 will have to have the program what 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.960
 low torrent itaobim 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.490
 the torrent or torrent and then you go in this 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.540
 link here that I'll leave in the description 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:22.020
 from the video 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:25.200
 He has 13 gigs. I know he's my big brother. 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:27.720
 but it's definitely worth it because 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:32.160
 everything is here and it's very, very easy 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:34.850
 to install even then are you have 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:38.190
 program you click here hitch far 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:40.380
 start application and here you go 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:43.260
 choose the right directory where to go 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:44.550
 your download as I already did it I do not 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:48.030
 is downloading again 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:52.250
 so I'm canceling here and ready 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:55.350
 now when you finished downloading 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:56.430
 and you go in the folder that would be the case 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:58.920
 That 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:00.510
 and you will find two files here 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:03.090
 this one can ignore because people 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:05.760
 will not use it and then we 'll go 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:07.140
 use this here the iso file of 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:09.660
 Image 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:12.420
 and you're going to have to have daemon tools there 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:14.790
 if you do not use windows 8 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:17.610
 because I do not know if windows 7 does 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:18.560
 This must do but I never do not know 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:21.690
 Confirm 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:23.580
 I do not need daemon tools because I 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:26.790
 already mounted automatically 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:29.220
 but if you did not bring the use of motorbikes 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:31.140
 double click on what it already is going 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:34.020
 alone I have to click with the 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:37.950
 right click mount and then 

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:42.209
 these are my files from my of 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:44.160
 my folder is not my dvd here the star is 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:46.290
 here is the file that we will 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:53.610
 install it now, so I'll click the 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:55.380
 your top and then to start the installation is 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:04:00.740
 I think the closest language has 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:04:00.740
 two is because it does not have portuguese doc 

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:09.590
 I started the song very boring but 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.940
 You may be stopping her. 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:16.250
 decrease everything and that 's where the directory is 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:18.560
 which will be the program files and there 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:21.530
 is the name of your folder of your remembering 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:24.680
 it will be replaced're so will not 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:30.740
 having more than 5km scrolls will be 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:34.280
 this one is not to change anything here and click 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:37.970
 to install here is not sure if you 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:39.740
 you see but here is the progress of the 

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:41.990
 my installation 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:44.030
 So when will that belly come to 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:44.900
 end because I think it's going to take a 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:47.960
 little 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:50.960
 is our game will be installed with the 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:53.560
 3rd dp from 1.9 I'm going to make a video 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:05:00.020
 ready for anyone who wants only update 1.9 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:05:04.010
 And you see there causing video 

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:06.050
 class to not get too long and there 

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:08.949
 soon enough when I have almost 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:08.949
 ending the vote 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:13.700
 good staff is the setup here is 

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:17.180
 Almost finishing 

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:19.880
 It's then who waits a little bit and I 

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:23.720
 I wanted to talk a little things that are 

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:25.760
 you are looking for update 1.9 only 

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:26.720
 it if you do not want to install what 

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:31.190
 you already have 

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:33.500
 I advise you not to see this video is 

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:37.190
 that I'm going to do 1 to 0 

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:40.940
 I already did is about how you will install 

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:44.210
 update 1.9 is then this is the only one here 

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:48.199
 for whoever uninstalled everything that 

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:51.949
 You do not have any more love, then you are. 

00:05:48.199 --> 00:05:56.139
 April 11 out here and now we're going 

00:05:51.949 --> 00:06:02.750
 crack it then it goes in the dvd drive 

00:05:56.139 --> 00:06:06.979
 It's open and there's going to be the files there. 

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:10.310
 this folder is the crack says copy what 

00:06:06.979 --> 00:06:13.430
 is in here computer disks and 

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:17.449
 files from this folder here 

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:19.490
 It's no but you do not necessarily need 

00:06:17.449 --> 00:06:20.689
 I do not know if I do not know where you are 

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:25.479
 installed 

00:06:20.689 --> 00:06:31.669
 so here it is very similar even as 

00:06:25.479 --> 00:06:35.870
 as the normal game files are in 

00:06:31.669 --> 00:06:42.439
 school to replace files does this 

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:46.610
 father pose has the current continues and ready 

00:06:42.439 --> 00:06:51.620
 our game is installed with the three 

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:53.479
 update them 1.9 and remembering that 

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:55.879
 is with the bugs fixed is by 

00:06:53.479 --> 00:06:57.169
 less is what they say is with update 13 

00:06:55.879 --> 00:07:02.870
 which is a new point 

00:06:57.169 --> 00:07:05.689
 blogs are fixed it's all legal 

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:07.939
 and if you want to see even if you activated the 

00:07:05.689 --> 00:07:10.249
 1.9 cell phone you think you do not have 

00:07:07.939 --> 00:07:14.120
 A lot of difference in the game is just you in the 

00:07:10.249 --> 00:07:16.610
 menu is there and you see the difficulty is 

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:20.229
 sure to have beyond the area that is the 

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:22.969
 that has been added now the staff is 

00:07:20.229 --> 00:07:23.629
 In this video lesson, it's just that I'm staying for 

00:07:22.969 --> 00:07:26.810
 on here 

00:07:23.629 --> 00:07:31.149
 any doubt the comment is just to say 

00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:31.149
 that's it
