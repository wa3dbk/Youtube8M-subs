00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
is I really wasn't that impressed with

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:29.210 
is I really wasn't that impressed with
the<00:00:23.609> graphics<00:00:27.289> it<00:00:28.289> really<00:00:28.800> didn't<00:00:29.099> look<00:00:29.130> a

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
the graphics it really didn't look a

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.519 
the graphics it really didn't look a
whole<00:00:29.369> lot<00:00:29.429> different<00:00:29.580> from<00:00:30.029> this<00:00:30.990> from<00:00:31.410> the

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
whole lot different from this from the

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.580 
whole lot different from this from the
previous<00:00:31.980> gen<00:00:32.219> but<00:00:33.120> right<00:00:33.270> now<00:00:33.450> you<00:00:34.440> might

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
previous gen but right now you might

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.889 
previous gen but right now you might
notice<00:00:34.649> that<00:00:34.950> we<00:00:35.160> are<00:00:35.280> on<00:00:35.309> a<00:00:35.540> aircraft<00:00:36.540> carrier

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
notice that we are on a aircraft carrier

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.720 
notice that we are on a aircraft carrier
this<00:00:36.989> is<00:00:37.079> actually<00:00:37.410> the<00:00:37.500> battlefield<00:00:37.950> 4<00:00:38.309> level

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
this is actually the battlefield 4 level

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.880 
this is actually the battlefield 4 level
I'm<00:00:39.540> planning<00:00:39.840> with<00:00:39.960> McIlroy<00:00:40.379> right<00:00:40.620> now<00:00:40.739> and

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
I'm planning with McIlroy right now and

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.910 
I'm planning with McIlroy right now and
I'm<00:00:41.010> about<00:00:41.280> to<00:00:41.340> tee<00:00:41.670> off<00:00:42.290> it's<00:00:43.290> a<00:00:43.440> little<00:00:43.800> bit

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
I'm about to tee off it's a little bit

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.100 
I'm about to tee off it's a little bit
different<00:00:44.280> than<00:00:44.370> controls<00:00:44.789> I<00:00:45.210> probably

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
different than controls I probably

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.660 
different than controls I probably
should<00:00:46.379> have<00:00:46.410> done<00:00:46.590> more<00:00:46.620> of<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:47.129> tutorial<00:00:47.280> a

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
should have done more of the tutorial a

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.200 
should have done more of the tutorial a
skip<00:00:47.910> a<00:00:48.030> lot<00:00:48.149> of<00:00:48.329> it<00:00:49.460> but<00:00:50.460> we'll<00:00:50.820> see<00:00:50.969> how<00:00:51.059> this

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
skip a lot of it but we'll see how this

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.850 
skip a lot of it but we'll see how this
goes<00:00:51.300> I<00:00:51.840> was<00:00:52.590> pretty<00:00:52.980> good<00:00:53.100> at<00:00:53.219> this<00:00:53.309> game<00:00:54.860> okay

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
goes I was pretty good at this game okay

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.849 
goes I was pretty good at this game okay
I've<00:00:56.010> got<00:00:56.160> an<00:00:56.280> 8-iron<00:00:57.320> yeah<00:00:58.320> as<00:00:58.440> I<00:00:58.530> was<00:00:58.559> saying

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
not not that impressed with the graphics

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.179 
not not that impressed with the graphics
from<00:01:01.260> what<00:01:01.500> I<00:01:01.530> played<00:01:03.530> that's<00:01:04.530> a<00:01:04.710> pretty

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
from what I played that's a pretty

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.070 
from what I played that's a pretty
straight<00:01:05.970> shot<00:01:06.240> you<00:01:06.330> can<00:01:06.420> see<00:01:06.479> the<00:01:06.720> swing

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
straight shot you can see the swing

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.679 
straight shot you can see the swing
meter<00:01:07.320> in<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.560> bottom<00:01:08.220> to<00:01:09.180> bring<00:01:09.360> it<00:01:09.479> back<00:01:09.659> a

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
meter in the bottom to bring it back a

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:17.890 
meter in the bottom to bring it back a
bit<00:01:09.840> here<00:01:12.439> that's<00:01:13.439> pretty<00:01:13.650> good<00:01:15.229> thank<00:01:16.229> you

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:17.900 
bit here that's pretty good thank you

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:19.570 
bit here that's pretty good thank you
although<00:01:18.650> the<00:01:18.770> lighting<00:01:19.040> does<00:01:19.220> look<00:01:19.460> better

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:19.580 
although the lighting does look better

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:21.010 
although the lighting does look better
it<00:01:19.820> kind<00:01:20.000> of<00:01:20.030> shows<00:01:20.210> it<00:01:20.360> off<00:01:20.450> better<00:01:20.600> in<00:01:20.840> this

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:21.020 
it kind of shows it off better in this

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.680 
it kind of shows it off better in this
level<00:01:21.730> with<00:01:22.730> the<00:01:22.820> character<00:01:23.180> models<00:01:23.510> to<00:01:23.600> me

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:23.690 
level with the character models to me

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:24.790 
level with the character models to me
don't<00:01:23.930> look<00:01:24.050> much<00:01:24.230> different<00:01:24.500> than<00:01:24.680> the

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:24.800 
don't look much different than the

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:28.180 
don't look much different than the
previous<00:01:25.130> generation<00:01:26.740> putting<00:01:27.740> when<00:01:28.010> I<00:01:28.040> was

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:28.190 
previous generation putting when I was

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:29.650 
previous generation putting when I was
having<00:01:28.460> a<00:01:28.520> lot<00:01:28.760> of<00:01:28.790> trouble<00:01:29.330> with<00:01:29.360> putting

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:29.660 
having a lot of trouble with putting

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:35.620 
having a lot of trouble with putting
here<00:01:31.210> so<00:01:32.210> we<00:01:32.330> got<00:01:32.450> a<00:01:32.480> slight<00:01:32.990> downhill<00:01:34.630> in

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630 
here so we got a slight downhill in

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:37.840 
here so we got a slight downhill in
previous<00:01:36.140> games<00:01:36.350> that<00:01:36.920> basically<00:01:37.400> the<00:01:37.610> meter

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:37.850 
previous games that basically the meter

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:39.190 
previous games that basically the meter
there's<00:01:38.090> really<00:01:38.270> throwing<00:01:38.630> me<00:01:38.750> off<00:01:38.960> I<00:01:39.140> don't

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.200 
there's really throwing me off I don't

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.560 
there's really throwing me off I don't
know<00:01:39.320> why<00:01:39.470> it's<00:01:39.620> going<00:01:39.800> so<00:01:39.920> fast<00:01:40.480> but<00:01:41.480> in

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:41.570 
know why it's going so fast but in

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:44.080 
know why it's going so fast but in
previous<00:01:42.050> games<00:01:42.410> i<00:01:42.680> would<00:01:42.830> just<00:01:43.670> by<00:01:43.820> looking

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.090 
previous games i would just by looking

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.720 
previous games i would just by looking
up<00:01:44.210> the<00:01:44.330> grid<00:01:44.660> 2<00:01:45.410> inches<00:01:45.680> down<00:01:45.890> this<00:01:46.430> should

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:46.730 
up the grid 2 inches down this should

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:51.370 
up the grid 2 inches down this should
more<00:01:47.000> than<00:01:47.060> do<00:01:47.330> it<00:01:49.990> that's<00:01:50.990> not<00:01:51.200> how<00:01:51.320> you

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:51.380 
more than do it that's not how you

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:53.140 
more than do it that's not how you
pictured<00:01:51.710> Frank<00:01:52.310> when<00:01:52.460> you<00:01:52.490> step<00:01:52.820> on<00:01:52.970> that

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:53.150 
pictured Frank when you step on that

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:54.969 
pictured Frank when you step on that
first<00:01:53.420> potting<00:01:54.050> has<00:01:54.170> been<00:01:54.320> really<00:01:54.710> tough<00:01:54.920> for

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:54.979 
first potting has been really tough for

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:56.830 
first potting has been really tough for
me<00:01:55.310> and<00:01:55.430> that's<00:01:55.520> a<00:01:55.670> part<00:01:56.450> of<00:01:56.479> the<00:01:56.570> reason<00:01:56.810> why

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
me and that's a part of the reason why

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.510 
me and that's a part of the reason why
the<00:01:57.350> first<00:01:57.560> round<00:01:57.740> actually<00:01:58.130> didn't<00:01:58.310> pass<00:01:58.490> it

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:58.520 
the first round actually didn't pass it

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.340 
the first round actually didn't pass it
I<00:01:58.910> think<00:01:59.420> you<00:01:59.479> get<00:01:59.600> an<00:01:59.660> achievement<00:01:59.750> for<00:02:00.140> that

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:00.350 
I think you get an achievement for that

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:04.390 
I think you get an achievement for that
too<00:02:00.619> so<00:02:02.979> shouldn't<00:02:03.979> have<00:02:04.070> to<00:02:04.160> worry<00:02:04.250> about

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:04.400 
too so shouldn't have to worry about

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:08.410

okay<00:03:12.410> so<00:03:12.470> I<00:03:12.710> don't<00:03:12.980> understand<00:03:13.460> the<00:03:14.270> line<00:03:14.540> it's

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750 
okay so I don't understand the line it's

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:20.110

showing<00:03:15.170> me<00:03:15.350> there<00:03:18.280> it<00:03:19.280> doesn't<00:03:19.640> move<00:03:19.790> at<00:03:20.000> all

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120 
showing me there it doesn't move at all

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:25.960 
showing me there it doesn't move at all
I<00:03:20.180> don't<00:03:20.450> I<00:03:20.660> don't<00:03:20.750> get<00:03:21.080> this<00:03:21.230> I<00:03:24.970> basically

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970 
I don't I don't get this I basically

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:28.330 
I don't I don't get this I basically
might<00:03:26.270> have<00:03:26.360> to<00:03:26.450> ignore<00:03:26.630> that<00:03:26.900> crazy<00:03:27.260> hash<00:03:28.040> tag

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:28.340 
might have to ignore that crazy hash tag

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:30.580 
might have to ignore that crazy hash tag
line<00:03:28.610> there<00:03:28.910> because<00:03:29.900> it's<00:03:30.080> really<00:03:30.230> doing

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:30.590 
line there because it's really doing

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:33.670 
line there because it's really doing
nothing<00:03:30.860> but<00:03:30.980> confusing<00:03:31.460> me<00:03:31.730> and<00:03:32.380> just<00:03:33.380> go<00:03:33.530> by

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:33.680 
nothing but confusing me and just go by

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:38.290 
nothing but confusing me and just go by
the<00:03:33.740> grid<00:03:34.190> if<00:03:34.910> I'm<00:03:35.180> going<00:03:35.210> by<00:03:35.600> the<00:03:35.660> grid<00:03:37.300> it

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:38.300 
the grid if I'm going by the grid it

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:39.990 
the grid if I'm going by the grid it
doesn't<00:03:38.600> even<00:03:38.660> really<00:03:38.870> give<00:03:39.140> you<00:03:39.230> a<00:03:39.260> top<00:03:39.590> view

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.000 
doesn't even really give you a top view

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.950 
doesn't even really give you a top view
I<00:03:41.000> guess<00:03:41.570> if<00:03:41.720> I<00:03:43.090> this<00:03:44.090> is<00:03:44.330> the<00:03:44.360> view<00:03:44.630> it<00:03:44.780> should

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:44.960 
I guess if I this is the view it should

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:50.020 
I guess if I this is the view it should
default<00:03:45.320> to<00:03:45.470> so<00:03:45.980> you<00:03:46.040> can<00:03:46.450> better<00:03:47.450> judge<00:03:47.630> it<00:03:49.030> so

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:50.030 
default to so you can better judge it so

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:52.030 
default to so you can better judge it so
we're<00:03:50.180> going<00:03:50.330> downhill<00:03:50.840> I<00:03:51.230> need<00:03:51.620> to<00:03:51.770> go<00:03:51.860> that

we're going downhill I need to go that

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:58.170 
we're going downhill I need to go that
far<00:03:52.280> past<00:03:52.760> and<00:03:53.180> this<00:03:53.360> should<00:03:53.540> do<00:03:53.720> it<00:03:53.780> easily

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:58.180 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:00.910 

it's<00:03:59.180> the<00:03:59.480> it's<00:03:59.930> the<00:04:00.080> really<00:04:00.350> fast<00:04:00.590> moving

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:00.920
