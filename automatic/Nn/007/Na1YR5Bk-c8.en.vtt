so of thread we will take one of these

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:54.340 
so of thread we will take one of these
pegs<00:00:50.410> now<00:00:51.410> these<00:00:51.680> pegs<00:00:52.040> will<00:00:52.790> have<00:00:53.060> a<00:00:53.360> slot<00:00:53.780> cut

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:54.350 
pegs now these pegs will have a slot cut

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:58.090 
pegs now these pegs will have a slot cut
into<00:00:54.890> them<00:00:55.450> you<00:00:56.450> just<00:00:56.720> put<00:00:56.989> your<00:00:57.170> thread<00:00:57.890> right

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:58.100 
into them you just put your thread right

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.100 
into them you just put your thread right
through<00:00:58.399> that<00:00:58.610> slot<00:00:58.970> wrap<00:00:59.420> it<00:00:59.600> around<00:00:59.720> a

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:00.110 
through that slot wrap it around a

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:04.630 
through that slot wrap it around a
couple<00:01:00.140> of<00:01:00.560> times<00:01:00.620> and<00:01:02.410> insert<00:01:03.410> the<00:01:03.680> peg<00:01:03.950> into

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:04.640 
couple of times and insert the peg into

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.289 
couple of times and insert the peg into
one<00:01:04.850> of<00:01:05.030> these<00:01:05.180> holes<00:01:06.460> up<00:01:07.460> over<00:01:07.880> the<00:01:08.030> top

one of these holes up over the top

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:13.690 
one of these holes up over the top
that's<00:01:08.899> one<00:01:09.350> warp<00:01:10.069> thread<00:01:11.200> back<00:01:12.200> around<00:01:12.950> the

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:13.700 
that's one warp thread back around the

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:24.219 
that's one warp thread back around the
rod<00:01:14.049> that's<00:01:15.049> -<00:01:16.929> there's<00:01:17.929> five<00:01:20.709> six<00:01:23.229> seven

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:24.229 
rod that's - there's five six seven

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:27.010 
rod that's - there's five six seven
we're<00:01:25.039> working<00:01:25.520> on<00:01:25.670> number<00:01:26.090> eight<00:01:26.329> and<00:01:26.749> it

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:27.020 
we're working on number eight and it

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:28.989 
we're working on number eight and it
looks<00:01:27.289> like<00:01:27.350> we<00:01:27.709> should<00:01:27.740> go<00:01:28.130> under<00:01:28.399> the<00:01:28.579> bottom

00:01:28.989 --> 00:01:28.999 
looks like we should go under the bottom

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:31.660 
looks like we should go under the bottom
but<00:01:29.179> that<00:01:29.209> won't<00:01:29.509> work<00:01:29.770> we<00:01:30.770> have<00:01:30.950> to<00:01:31.100> go<00:01:31.249> over

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:31.670 
but that won't work we have to go over

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:33.910 
but that won't work we have to go over
the<00:01:31.850> top<00:01:32.079> and<00:01:33.079> you'll<00:01:33.259> notice<00:01:33.499> it<00:01:33.709> came<00:01:33.889> a

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:33.920 
the top and you'll notice it came a

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:35.830 
the top and you'll notice it came a
little<00:01:34.100> loose<00:01:34.369> that's<00:01:34.700> no<00:01:34.939> problem<00:01:35.450> that<00:01:35.659> will

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:35.840 
little loose that's no problem that will

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.199 
little loose that's no problem that will
happen<00:01:36.020> probably<00:01:36.920> every<00:01:37.219> time<00:01:37.490> you<00:01:37.700> warp<00:01:37.939> your

00:01:38.199 --> 00:01:38.209 
happen probably every time you warp your

00:01:38.209 --> 00:01:39.940 
happen probably every time you warp your
loom<00:01:38.389> you<00:01:39.020> just<00:01:39.289> pull<00:01:39.499> on<00:01:39.529> it

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950 
loom you just pull on it

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.359 
loom you just pull on it
and<00:01:40.060> it<00:01:41.060> tightens<00:01:41.329> right<00:01:41.600> back<00:01:41.990> up<00:01:42.289> we<00:01:43.189> will

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:43.369 
and it tightens right back up we will

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:46.090 
and it tightens right back up we will
take<00:01:43.579> another<00:01:43.789> warp<00:01:44.329> peg<00:01:44.659> wrap<00:01:45.499> around<00:01:45.950> a

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:46.100 
take another warp peg wrap around a

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.309 
take another warp peg wrap around a
couple<00:01:46.340> of<00:01:46.520> times<00:01:46.579> go<00:01:47.179> back<00:01:47.450> through<00:01:47.749> the<00:01:47.959> slot

00:01:48.309 --> 00:01:48.319 
couple of times go back through the slot

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:58.870 
couple of times go back through the slot
again<00:01:48.939> and<00:01:53.079> into<00:01:54.079> the<00:01:54.259> next<00:01:54.950> hole<00:01:57.700> now<00:01:58.700> if

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
again and into the next hole now if

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:00.669 
again and into the next hole now if
you've<00:01:59.060> lost<00:01:59.299> some<00:01:59.719> of<00:01:59.749> your<00:01:59.869> tension<00:02:00.469> when

00:02:00.669 --> 00:02:00.679 
you've lost some of your tension when

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:02.559 
you've lost some of your tension when
you're<00:02:00.859> doing<00:02:01.189> that<00:02:01.340> that's<00:02:01.669> not<00:02:01.969> a<00:02:02.029> problem

00:02:02.559 --> 00:02:02.569 
you're doing that that's not a problem

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:05.019 
you're doing that that's not a problem
just<00:02:02.899> like<00:02:02.990> tuning<00:02:03.619> a<00:02:03.709> guitar<00:02:03.740> you<00:02:04.429> just<00:02:04.700> twist

00:02:05.019 --> 00:02:05.029 
just like tuning a guitar you just twist
