of it and I was like wow I couldn't
believe<00:01:03.040> that<00:01:03.190> something<00:01:04.030> like<00:01:04.210> this<00:01:04.510> we're

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:04.720 
believe that something like this we're

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.710 
believe that something like this we're
going<00:01:04.839> to<00:01:04.900> be<00:01:05.020> actually<00:01:05.140> pulled<00:01:05.620> off<00:01:06.720> cause

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:07.720 
going to be actually pulled off cause

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.980 
going to be actually pulled off cause

roll drum track and

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:14.560 
roll drum track and
it<00:01:12.740> literally<00:01:13.130> is<00:01:13.250> happening<00:01:13.820> and<00:01:14.030> that's<00:01:14.330> the

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:14.570 
it literally is happening and that's the

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:17.860 
it literally is happening and that's the
mind-boggling<00:01:15.140> fitness<00:01:15.800> for<00:01:16.550> them<00:01:16.760> trying<00:01:17.750> to

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:17.870 
mind-boggling fitness for them trying to

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:20.080 
mind-boggling fitness for them trying to
get<00:01:17.960> the<00:01:18.020> car<00:01:18.320> to<00:01:18.710> play<00:01:19.040> that<00:01:19.310> track<00:01:19.640> the

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:20.090 
get the car to play that track the

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:21.640 
get the car to play that track the
initial<00:01:20.450> challenge<00:01:20.780> was<00:01:20.900> just<00:01:21.110> figuring<00:01:21.470> on

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:21.650 
initial challenge was just figuring on

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:25.180 
initial challenge was just figuring on
how<00:01:21.890> we<00:01:22.820> would<00:01:23.150> trigger<00:01:23.510> a<00:01:23.810> drum<00:01:24.200> the<00:01:24.800> car<00:01:25.040> had

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:25.190 
how we would trigger a drum the car had

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:27.280 
how we would trigger a drum the car had
to<00:01:25.340> be<00:01:25.370> very<00:01:25.640> close<00:01:25.850> to<00:01:26.060> the<00:01:26.120> drug<00:01:26.360> and<00:01:27.110> to

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:27.290 
to be very close to the drug and to

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:29.500 
to be very close to the drug and to
trigger<00:01:27.560> the<00:01:27.740> drum<00:01:27.950> very<00:01:28.190> precisely<00:01:28.610> there's

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:29.510 
trigger the drum very precisely there's

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:33.040 
trigger the drum very precisely there's
the<00:01:29.690> sensor<00:01:30.080> pad<00:01:30.970> the<00:01:31.970> car<00:01:32.180> tire<00:01:32.450> runs<00:01:32.750> over

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:33.050 
the sensor pad the car tire runs over

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:37.000 
the sensor pad the car tire runs over
this<00:01:33.790> triggers<00:01:34.790> the<00:01:34.880> actuator<00:01:35.620> which<00:01:36.620> goes<00:01:36.830> to

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:37.010 
this triggers the actuator which goes to

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:38.860 
this triggers the actuator which goes to
hear<00:01:37.280> hear<00:01:37.910> it<00:01:38.030> actually<00:01:38.330> ends<00:01:38.570> up<00:01:38.630> pulling

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:38.870 
hear hear it actually ends up pulling

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:42.100 
hear hear it actually ends up pulling
this<00:01:39.080> cable<00:01:39.500> down<00:01:39.670> nothing<00:01:40.670> replaces<00:01:40.970> a<00:01:41.510> human

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:42.110 
this cable down nothing replaces a human

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:44.740 
this cable down nothing replaces a human
who<00:01:42.560> is<00:01:42.650> sticking<00:01:43.130> their<00:01:43.310> hand<00:01:43.750> actually

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:44.750 
who is sticking their hand actually

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:47.170 
who is sticking their hand actually
hitting<00:01:45.650> a<00:01:45.860> drum<00:01:46.130> if<00:01:46.580> I<00:01:46.700> had<00:01:46.850> to<00:01:46.970> tell<00:01:47.150> you

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:47.180 
hitting a drum if I had to tell you

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.090 
hitting a drum if I had to tell you
these<00:01:47.330> engineers<00:01:47.900> have<00:01:48.200> probably<00:01:48.620> done<00:01:48.800> as

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100 
these engineers have probably done as

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.010 
these engineers have probably done as
good<00:01:49.250> a<00:01:49.490> job<00:01:49.580> as<00:01:49.820> anything<00:01:50.240> happening<00:01:50.900> is

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 
good a job as anything happening is

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.740 
good a job as anything happening is
what's<00:01:51.260> on<00:01:51.470> this<00:01:51.800> right<00:01:52.070> here<00:01:52.540> so<00:01:53.540> when<00:01:53.660> the

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 
what's on this right here so when the

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.230 
what's on this right here so when the
sensor<00:01:53.990> comes<00:01:54.350> over<00:01:54.650> here<00:01:55.120> triggers<00:01:56.120> this

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.240 
sensor comes over here triggers this

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.780 
sensor comes over here triggers this
actuator<00:01:56.660> right<00:01:57.050> here<00:01:57.290> pull<00:01:57.890> this<00:01:58.160> down<00:01:58.430> and

00:01:58.780 --> 00:01:58.790 
actuator right here pull this down and

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:01.570 
actuator right here pull this down and
actually<00:01:59.000> makes<00:01:59.330> the<00:01:59.450> drumstick<00:02:00.430> hit<00:02:01.430> the

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:01.580 
actually makes the drumstick hit the

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:07.090 
actually makes the drumstick hit the
shell<00:02:02.229> like<00:02:03.229> this<00:02:04.810> and<00:02:05.810> there<00:02:06.560> are<00:02:06.620> only<00:02:06.680> one

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:07.100 
shell like this and there are only one

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.070 
shell like this and there are only one
time<00:02:07.400> shot<00:02:07.729> so<00:02:08.060> basically<00:02:08.479> the<00:02:08.630> so<00:02:08.810> the<00:02:08.929> front

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.080 
time shot so basically the so the front

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.050 
time shot so basically the so the front
tire<00:02:09.380> will<00:02:09.619> hit<00:02:09.770> it<00:02:09.890> will<00:02:10.399> go<00:02:10.520> like<00:02:10.550> that<00:02:10.850> the

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 
tire will hit it will go like that the

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:12.430 
tire will hit it will go like that the
back<00:02:11.210> tire<00:02:11.480> will<00:02:11.630> hit<00:02:11.780> it<00:02:11.870> and<00:02:12.020> nothing<00:02:12.320> will

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
back tire will hit it and nothing will

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:19.260 
back tire will hit it and nothing will
happen<00:02:13.270> cool

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:19.270 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:22.140 

the<00:02:19.960> placement<00:02:20.440> of<00:02:20.500> the<00:02:20.620> drums<00:02:20.890> was<00:02:21.850> a

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
the placement of the drums was a

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.510 
the placement of the drums was a
mathematical<00:02:22.870> thing<00:02:23.080> but<00:02:23.740> it<00:02:24.130> literally

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:24.520 
mathematical thing but it literally

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:27.240 
mathematical thing but it literally
broke<00:02:24.820> down<00:02:25.060> into<00:02:25.410> fractions<00:02:26.410> of<00:02:26.770> a<00:02:26.860> second

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
broke down into fractions of a second

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:30.840 
broke down into fractions of a second
just<00:02:27.670> got<00:02:27.880> the<00:02:28.000> music<00:02:29.100> each<00:02:30.100> measure<00:02:30.430> is<00:02:30.670> one

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:30.850 
just got the music each measure is one

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:32.820 
just got the music each measure is one

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 
and two and three and four so we're

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:54.480 
and two and three and four so we're
going<00:02:53.200> to<00:02:53.320> go<00:02:53.350> ahead<00:02:53.500> and<00:02:53.650> find<00:02:53.980> out<00:02:54.190> where<00:02:54.370> we

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:54.490 
going to go ahead and find out where we

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:55.590 
going to go ahead and find out where we
need<00:02:54.640> to<00:02:54.700> put<00:02:54.910> these<00:02:55.000> on<00:02:55.210> the<00:02:55.360> track

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:55.600 
need to put these on the track

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:58.860 
need to put these on the track
equidistant<00:02:56.380> I<00:02:56.950> think<00:02:57.370> I'm<00:02:57.460> a<00:02:57.490> point<00:02:58.150> three<00:02:58.450> be

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
equidistant I think I'm a point three be

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:00.870 
equidistant I think I'm a point three be
permitted<00:02:59.410> but<00:02:59.590> that's<00:03:00.100> incorrect<00:03:00.400> so<00:03:00.670> I<00:03:00.730> got

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:00.880 
permitted but that's incorrect so I got

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:02.460 
permitted but that's incorrect so I got
to<00:03:00.970> move<00:03:01.060> my<00:03:01.180> decimal<00:03:01.390> point<00:03:01.690> to<00:03:02.110> the<00:03:02.140> finish

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
to move my decimal point to the finish

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:05.190 
to move my decimal point to the finish
college<00:03:03.660> when<00:03:04.660> they<00:03:04.780> were<00:03:04.840> laying<00:03:05.020> at<00:03:05.170> the

at<00:03:06.790> a<00:03:06.880> time<00:03:07.530> so<00:03:08.530> in<00:03:08.620> the<00:03:08.680> musical<00:03:09.070> notation<00:03:09.900> for

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 
at a time so in the musical notation for

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:12.780 
at a time so in the musical notation for
beats<00:03:11.200> is<00:03:11.410> in<00:03:11.560> a<00:03:11.620> major<00:03:11.800> and<00:03:12.220> the<00:03:12.280> measures

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:12.790 
beats is in a major and the measures

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:16.560 
beats is in a major and the measures
were<00:03:12.970> 1.5<00:03:13.600> for<00:03:14.080> seconds<00:03:14.620> or<00:03:14.770> 155<00:03:15.550> beats<00:03:16.270> per

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:16.570 
were 1.5 for seconds or 155 beats per

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:18.480 
were 1.5 for seconds or 155 beats per

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:18.490 
minute is how the musicians figured it

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:20.970

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:27.490 
points around place yeah take the tape

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:29.340 
points around place yeah take the tape
measure<00:03:27.730> and<00:03:27.910> map<00:03:28.300> out<00:03:28.450> the<00:03:28.660> entire<00:03:28.930> course

measure and map out the entire course

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:31.140 
measure and map out the entire course
and<00:03:29.590> we'll<00:03:29.800> know<00:03:29.920> exactly<00:03:30.040> how<00:03:30.459> long<00:03:30.700> it<00:03:30.910> is<00:03:31.000> so

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.150 
and we'll know exactly how long it is so

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:32.940 
and we'll know exactly how long it is so
we<00:03:31.240> can<00:03:31.270> say<00:03:31.540> okay<00:03:31.870> three<00:03:32.470> and<00:03:32.560> a<00:03:32.590> half<00:03:32.650> feet

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:32.950 
we can say okay three and a half feet

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:55.760 
now we have all these bass drums lined

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:58.150 
now we have all these bass drums lined
up<00:03:55.940> and<00:03:56.090> we<00:03:56.180> need<00:03:56.330> to<00:03:56.420> tune<00:03:56.920> every<00:03:57.920> one<00:03:58.070> of

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:58.160 
up and we need to tune every one of

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.040 
up and we need to tune every one of
these<00:03:58.250> bass<00:03:58.490> drums<00:03:58.850> as<00:03:59.180> closely<00:03:59.690> as<00:03:59.900> possible

so<00:04:00.740> when<00:04:00.980> the<00:04:01.070> car<00:04:01.280> comes<00:04:02.150> down<00:04:02.390> the<00:04:02.540> track<00:04:02.570> and

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:03.170 
so when the car comes down the track and

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:04.570 
so when the car comes down the track and
it's<00:04:03.410> playing<00:04:03.650> this<00:04:03.740> beef<00:04:04.010> it's<00:04:04.280> all<00:04:04.400> gonna

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:04.580 
it's playing this beef it's all gonna

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:21.610 
it's playing this beef it's all gonna
sound<00:04:04.880> uniform<00:04:18.610> just<00:04:19.610> a<00:04:19.700> few<00:04:19.910> minutes<00:04:20.620> we're

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:21.620 
sound uniform just a few minutes we're

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:23.440 
sound uniform just a few minutes we're
going<00:04:21.709> to<00:04:21.830> see<00:04:22.070> the<00:04:22.460> car<00:04:22.670> actually<00:04:22.940> run<00:04:23.300> over

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:23.450 
going to see the car actually run over

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:36.710 
going to see the car actually run over
the<00:04:23.540> trigger<00:04:23.780> we'll<00:04:24.110> see<00:04:24.730> how<00:04:25.730> it<00:04:25.880> sounds

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:36.720 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:39.480 

the<00:04:37.720> first<00:04:37.990> time<00:04:38.170> I<00:04:38.200> came<00:04:38.320> on<00:04:38.620> the<00:04:38.710> satin<00:04:39.130> and

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:39.490 
the first time I came on the satin and

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:41.510 
the first time I came on the satin and
saw<00:04:40.120> the<00:04:40.180> way<00:04:40.480> the<00:04:40.630> drums<00:04:40.930> were<00:04:41.110> set<00:04:41.350> up

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:41.520 
saw the way the drums were set up

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.560 
saw the way the drums were set up
obviously<00:04:42.520> I<00:04:42.550> was<00:04:42.730> very<00:04:42.940> nervous<00:04:43.180> at<00:04:43.480> the

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:43.570 
obviously I was very nervous at the
