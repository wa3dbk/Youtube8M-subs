00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.720
 hello today we will see how 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:09.090
 foam and a roof then you 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.190
 know that tiles with time have 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.440
 tend to overlap with lichens or 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.719
 frankly thick foam then there we 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:19.740
 instead of the 8th one can start to 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:26.789
 remove the bigger ones and for with a 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:29.760
 metal pin but we see that 6th 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:32.460
 vigorously its'm not from the 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.019
 then all to do the defoaming 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.730
 roof we will use so 

00:00:34.019 --> 00:00:38.130
 possibly a big one that will us 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:42.600
 allow to engage larger deposits 

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:46.200
 in the front we will use so a 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:50.610
 hand sprayer in which we go 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:52.260
 so put this product the corner night so 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.719
 the said foam which is a product 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:01:02.640
 professional conditioning in 5 liters there 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:01:04.050
 to treat the roofs then the 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.600
 defoaming will happen in two stages 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:10.860
 first time we will spray so on 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:13.640
 the roof on Sunday the company of a 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.960
 future and then then let's act 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:18.350
 either we'll have a little brush stroke 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.310
 either we clean and hide directly 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:21.509
 so be careful when you work 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.009
 on a roof there it turns out that 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.360
 our car is not this contract embankment 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.500
 so we have no protection otherwise 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.990
 do not forget to put a protection 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.990
 harness that keeps us peas secure 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:49.190
 so be careful of three markets on 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.930
 your car there you treated because 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:52.310
 that the puilboraines license and then he 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:54.160
 do not rain in the twelve 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:57.080
 hours you are a member 

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:58.910
 48 hours ago we let it dry so 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:01.790
 our products and act limoux what we 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:04.220
 has passed on the case so the monsoons 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:05.780
 well blackened and how this jsf and one 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:09.140
 will now move on to the next phase 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:10.940
 so clean with kärcher so we go 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:13.990
 to clean with kärcher etc the places which 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.990
 resists the wire brush 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:50.250
 so here you see the difference of 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:52.019
 cleanliness of your roof so yours 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:55.109
