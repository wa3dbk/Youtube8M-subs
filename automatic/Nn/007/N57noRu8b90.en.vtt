of<00:00:06.509> my<00:00:06.569> new<00:00:06.720> camera<00:00:07.160> the<00:00:08.420> Panasonic<00:00:09.420> DMC<00:00:10.080> SD<00:00:10.710> 35

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
of my new camera the Panasonic DMC SD 35

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.850 
of my new camera the Panasonic DMC SD 35
it's<00:00:12.090> a<00:00:12.210> point-and-shoot<00:00:12.660> so<00:00:13.230> basically<00:00:13.650> in

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
it's a point-and-shoot so basically in

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.140 
it's a point-and-shoot so basically in
this<00:00:13.950> video<00:00:14.130> I'm<00:00:14.429> just<00:00:14.490> going<00:00:14.700> to<00:00:14.820> do<00:00:14.940> an

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
this video I'm just going to do an

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.080 
this video I'm just going to do an
unboxing<00:00:15.480> and<00:00:15.990> in<00:00:16.650> my<00:00:16.740> next<00:00:16.920> video<00:00:17.279> it<00:00:17.490> will

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
unboxing and in my next video it will

00:00:18.090 --> 00:01:17.890 
unboxing and in my next video it will
probably<00:01:10.070> an<00:01:11.070> instruction<00:01:12.030> manual<00:01:12.060> on<00:01:12.659> disc

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:17.900 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.679 

the<00:01:18.900> software<00:01:19.770> for<00:01:20.430> installing<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:21.150> drivers

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
the software for installing the drivers

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.330 
the software for installing the drivers
and<00:01:22.020> I<00:01:22.229> guess<00:01:22.500> some<00:01:22.680> of<00:01:22.770> this<00:01:22.830> editing

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
and I guess some of this editing

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.440 
and I guess some of this editing
software<00:01:23.820> basic<00:01:24.720> stuff<00:01:25.640> then<00:01:26.640> getting<00:01:27.240> down

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
software basic stuff then getting down

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:33.080 
software basic stuff then getting down
to<00:01:28.610> the<00:01:29.610> camera<00:01:30.000> itself<00:01:31.040> we<00:01:32.040> have<00:01:32.340> wrapped
