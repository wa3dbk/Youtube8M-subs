00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:09.630 
bit noisy with the cars going by

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:11.580 
bit noisy with the cars going by
basically<00:02:10.630> that's<00:02:10.750> just<00:02:10.810> a<00:02:11.019> voicemail<00:02:11.440> box

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:13.949 
basically that's just a voicemail box
which<00:02:11.950> gives<00:02:11.980> you<00:02:12.370> the<00:02:12.760> next<00:02:12.940> coordinates<00:02:13.750> I

00:02:13.949 --> 00:02:13.959 
which gives you the next coordinates I

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:15.660 
which gives you the next coordinates I
thought<00:02:14.410> that<00:02:14.530> was<00:02:14.680> something<00:02:15.040> a<00:02:15.190> little<00:02:15.519> bit

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
thought that was something a little bit

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.090 
thought that was something a little bit
different<00:02:16.060> and<00:02:16.209> so<00:02:17.080> I<00:02:17.260> do<00:02:17.410> like<00:02:17.560> my<00:02:17.709> Maltese

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:18.100 
different and so I do like my Maltese

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:20.190

there we go let's sir let's head on over

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.440 
there we go let's sir let's head on over
to<00:02:20.380> those<00:02:20.650> coordinates<00:02:21.280> and<00:02:21.519> see<00:02:22.209> what<00:02:22.360> we

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
to those coordinates and see what we

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:26.670 
to those coordinates and see what we
find<00:02:22.660> next<00:02:22.989> and<00:02:24.600> so<00:02:25.600> if<00:02:25.720> you<00:02:25.840> take<00:02:26.019> your<00:02:26.080> GPS

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.920 
find next and so if you take your GPS
device<00:02:26.880> plumbing<00:02:27.880> the<00:02:28.030> coordinates<00:02:28.630> that<00:02:28.780> the

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
device plumbing the coordinates that the

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:31.410 
device plumbing the coordinates that the
lovely<00:02:29.170> Cindy<00:02:29.860> gave<00:02:30.069> us<00:02:30.280> it<00:02:30.880> should<00:02:31.090> lead<00:02:31.239> you
