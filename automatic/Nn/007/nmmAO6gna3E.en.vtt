00:00:00.859 --> 00:00:04.440

00:00:04.439 --> 00:00:08.440
 to reef on Wednesday the team faces the nautical in the capital 

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:12.860
 Pernambuco is the first meeting between the two teams after the match 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:18.430
 which marked the return of the first division team in 2005 in the delegation 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:22.840
 a new leo miner who has been training for more than a week in the Olympian 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:27.940
 may appear in the afflicted because of the suspension says that the avic and the injury of 

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:30.159
 pereirinha the difficult game complicated 

00:00:30.159 --> 00:00:33.190
 our man of a great victory how much currents in são paulo 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:37.320
 so we have to try to contain the total focus, but rather to signal that it is 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.260
 there recovering because we can make a good game get one more 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:42.410
 Score 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:45.300
 the nautical trying to get out of these wings relegation with that last victory 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.710
 on the corinthians but the guião also pass series of seven matches 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:49.790
 without lose 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:50.940
 ahern 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.680
 2 cross in different moments but in good moments the nautical in the parade to 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.590
 victory when buritis in são paulo that raised there any your 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:00.420
 team 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.370
 so by the life story and grimi did not think it would be a very commitment 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:08.530
 difficult with them now motivated by the victory how corinthians is more 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:09.440
 still difficult 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.110
 I'm sure we'll go. 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:15.540
 he regards the burden with all respect that he deserves as the species with the 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.990
 only this way if we can keep the 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.140
 game caps on the largest of up 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.350
 10 years with friends for each team as well 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.170
 program is to score goals improvement and the number of goals scored in the huts 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.300
 Brazilian 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:33.180
 is looking after having gone nani closed his listing and the 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.800
 goals made that is still in search of this 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:38.810
 but it's important that if at least I dine with the important goals the people 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.790
 not suffering too, then at this beginning until we hit it is 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:45.670
 important because it does not suffer goals like it has happened 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:48.730
 I hope that gradually I will get tc 

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:53.320
 this is what lippi also in the offensive share that will come naturally in the 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.810
 attackers also start to make goals and uncertainty and there we 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.540
 also improves in the south saus in the competition 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:02.590
 first encounter of a criminal after that game, right? 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:06.770
 I was a remarkable historical year ahead of the personal site that was in that game 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:10.980
 I tried chatting with my own technical access hand menezes to 

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:13.749
 respect of this meeting 

00:02:13.749 --> 00:02:16.089
 we remember with satisfaction 

00:02:16.089 --> 00:02:17.999
 nothing at the same time 

00:02:17.999 --> 00:02:23.069
 in the difficulty that was until the moment in the batches by the expelled players 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:26.199
 for almost losing the opportunity 

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:31.509
 suddenly the beer that I did have sanud expelled the match would end tied 20 

00:02:31.509 --> 00:02:32.139
 the guild 

00:02:32.139 --> 00:02:34.159
 they would or would not be tibiri ii 

00:02:34.159 --> 00:02:37.379
 but what is played of the remnants both here and 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:42.159
 then we can not see it as a rematch if we have to 

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:46.260
 face the nautical and fans of them but we have to stay focused is done 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:50.709
 has to do at the rate that one night in front performs in there explained that the 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:53.129
 people are thinking of quality 

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:56.039
 What was created that game of life? 

00:02:56.039 --> 00:02:58.999
 by the concentration that really has to do that is to play football 

00:02:58.999 --> 00:03:02.319
 and it will pass through your head when you enter the locker room of the afflicted 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:03.299
 year 

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:06.209
 you will not be able to register on the right 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:08.269
 and 2005, right? 

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:11.649
 It's going to be a locker room that looks bigger, I guess. 

00:03:11.649 --> 00:03:14.249
 with much better moments 

00:03:14.249 --> 00:03:18.560
 but I think the memories she circulated in the heads being the way 

00:03:18.559 --> 00:03:19.799
 delicious, right? 

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:24.040
 pt will not need anything of irregularity and transported a 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:27.939
 Idiot thing the occasion I think he has a crm remember this is ours 

00:03:27.939 --> 00:03:28.829
 time 

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:31.369
 So I put a lot of shock glory to see what we did there was a lot 

00:03:31.369 --> 00:03:35.209
 beautiful, we got nobody to bring back the team at that time in europe 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:40.430
 in an exciting game the team surprised the program managed to make the leisure 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:44.900
 I improved it would last little to leave with the title was to appease the ramp to excite 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:47.779
 who played in 2005 and will play in that same 

00:03:47.779 --> 00:03:50.779
 just look at November 26 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:56.199
 the olive groves that sow the polish tst field judged that will not forget the 

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:59.269
 The idea is to give and I do not know if there will be another player 

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:01.389
 I do not know how to play 

00:04:01.389 --> 00:04:04.209
 What will this game be? But for me it was 

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:07.559
 It's going to be very good to go back there. He remembers thinking. 

00:04:07.559 --> 00:04:12.479
 neel who was one of the main explorers who started also has 14 

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:13.669
 points 

00:04:13.669 --> 00:04:16.229
 an innocent attitude 

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:17.849
 At any moment 

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:19.219
 because this 

00:04:19.219 --> 00:04:23.599
 after leading the incredible campaign, I am the first tape to confirm that 

00:04:23.599 --> 00:04:26.419
 the punishment is is very great then 

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:31.099
 but I think it's going to be very good, the team also plays there 

00:04:31.099 --> 00:04:34.759
 remember that at the moment who knows that policeman does not apologize to 

00:04:34.759 --> 00:04:36.659
 you 

00:04:36.659 --> 00:04:38.259
 the crisis in the region 

00:04:38.259 --> 00:04:40.849
 turned me around and remained breathless. 

00:04:40.849 --> 00:04:42.629
 in the message that 

00:04:42.629 --> 00:04:46.499
 is to focus on the local market or fix it trying to do it 

00:04:46.499 --> 00:04:50.519
 your best understands end of your team is trying to defend it that part 

00:04:50.519 --> 00:04:51.259
 of income 

00:04:51.259 --> 00:04:52.740
 We're trying. 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:55.629
 certify that there was no penalty and such 

00:04:55.629 --> 00:04:58.870
 so you end up having attitudes sometimes 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:02.760
 it does not concern your person but if it happens then many are not subject 

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:05.999
 that happened to me this thing happened to anyone 

00:05:05.999 --> 00:05:09.459
 now the unimportant juca has grown because un wti is having a 

00:05:09.459 --> 00:05:10.180
 reaction 

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:13.449
 what did you think alexandre nassar our vacancy in the zone of classification 

00:05:13.449 --> 00:05:15.309
 liberators in the patrician 

00:05:15.309 --> 00:05:19.599
 we have to look for us the best player of the Brazilian championship - who 

00:05:19.599 --> 00:05:23.130
 seek to make a good game that could be very good moment 

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:26.600
 the safe was playing very well outside the house and collecting points outside the home 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:31.830
 this is very important we have to continue in this same rhythm there with golf 

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:35.530
 players coming back now the hand will have more conditions to put the team than 

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:38.620
 leads me to believe that I have felt the field to help us, so this is the 

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:41.930
 The players' thinking there continues to maintain a good pace and 

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:43.310
 then made the table
