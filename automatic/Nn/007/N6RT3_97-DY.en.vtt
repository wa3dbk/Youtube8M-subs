here<00:01:53.509> for<00:01:53.780> two<00:01:53.900> years<00:01:53.930> now<00:01:54.259> and<00:01:54.560> I<00:01:54.710> think

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.740 
here for two years now and I think

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:56.649 
here for two years now and I think
mechanically<00:01:55.700> they've<00:01:55.970> held<00:01:56.299> up<00:01:56.420> very<00:01:56.450> well

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:56.659 
mechanically they've held up very well

00:01:56.659 --> 00:01:59.230 
mechanically they've held up very well
also<00:01:57.500> what<00:01:57.860> we<00:01:57.890> like<00:01:58.100> about<00:01:58.130> the<00:01:58.490> ex<00:01:58.610> bikes<00:01:58.880> is

00:01:59.230 --> 00:01:59.240 
also what we like about the ex bikes is

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:02.260 
also what we like about the ex bikes is
the<00:02:00.110> storage<00:02:00.409> we<00:02:01.100> can<00:02:01.280> stow<00:02:01.580> them<00:02:01.790> quite

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270 
the storage we can stow them quite

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.139 
the storage we can stow them quite
neatly<00:02:02.540> in<00:02:02.899> a<00:02:03.229> corner<00:02:03.619> in<00:02:03.799> rows<00:02:04.430> so<00:02:05.000> they're

00:02:05.139 --> 00:02:05.149 
neatly in a corner in rows so they're

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:06.820 
neatly in a corner in rows so they're
very<00:02:05.479> easy<00:02:05.840> and<00:02:06.080> versatile<00:02:06.440> to<00:02:06.649> move

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:06.830 
very easy and versatile to move

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:09.010 
very easy and versatile to move
backwards<00:02:07.250> and<00:02:07.369> forwards<00:02:07.869> another<00:02:08.869> thing

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:09.020 
backwards and forwards another thing

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:10.600 
backwards and forwards another thing
about<00:02:09.080> x-bike<00:02:09.500> means<00:02:09.770> it<00:02:09.890> doesn't<00:02:10.069> have<00:02:10.280> to<00:02:10.580> be

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
about x-bike means it doesn't have to be

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
pti's have found that integrated it

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.420 
pti's have found that integrated it
within<00:02:14.750> their<00:02:15.050> circuit<00:02:15.590> training<00:02:15.800> so<00:02:16.310> it

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
within their circuit training so it

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.080 
within their circuit training so it
makes<00:02:16.610> it<00:02:16.790> a<00:02:16.880> more<00:02:17.030> diverse<00:02:17.410> PT<00:02:18.410> session<00:02:18.890> I<00:02:19.130> my
