Android's now a short while ago I posted
a<00:00:12.900> video<00:00:12.990> called<00:00:13.200> the<00:00:13.860> nano<00:00:14.280> SIM<00:00:14.639> card

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
a video called the nano SIM card

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
apparently that video wasn't everything

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.810 
apparently that video wasn't everything
you<00:00:19.109> need<00:00:19.260> to<00:00:19.380> know<00:00:19.410> a<00:00:19.740> big<00:00:20.310> thank<00:00:20.670> you<00:00:20.730> goes

you need to know a big thank you goes
out<00:00:21.180> to<00:00:21.330> sample<00:00:21.720> and<00:00:21.869> for<00:00:21.990> pointing<00:00:22.289> out<00:00:22.380> that

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
out to sample and for pointing out that

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
the micro SIM cards are in fact

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.050 
the micro SIM cards are in fact
different<00:00:24.830> depending<00:00:25.830> upon<00:00:25.980> which<00:00:26.369> network

you<00:00:27.330> are<00:00:27.390> on<00:00:27.650> now<00:00:28.650> let<00:00:28.800> me<00:00:28.859> just<00:00:29.010> run<00:00:29.220> through

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
you are on now let me just run through

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:30.919 
you are on now let me just run through

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
now in my previous video I was pointing

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.770 
now in my previous video I was pointing
out<00:00:53.070> that<00:00:53.309> if<00:00:53.520> you<00:00:53.670> were<00:00:53.760> cutting<00:00:54.180> down<00:00:54.210> from

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
out that if you were cutting down from

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.680 
out that if you were cutting down from
the<00:00:55.230> Vodafone<00:00:55.520> Micro<00:00:56.520> SIM<00:00:56.730> card<00:00:57.059> to<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.360> nano

the Vodafone Micro SIM card to the nano

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.110 
the Vodafone Micro SIM card to the nano
size<00:00:58.079> SIM<00:00:58.440> card<00:00:58.710> just<00:00:58.949> underneath<00:00:59.309> here<00:00:59.670> it

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
size SIM card just underneath here it

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.000 
size SIM card just underneath here it
would<00:01:00.359> mean<00:01:00.629> cutting<00:01:00.870> through<00:01:01.410> the<00:01:01.559> metal

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
would mean cutting through the metal

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.149 
would mean cutting through the metal
contacts<00:01:02.609> which<00:01:03.270> is<00:01:03.480> not<00:01:03.780> a<00:01:03.989> good<00:01:04.379> idea<00:01:04.650> I

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
contacts which is not a good idea I

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.070 
contacts which is not a good idea I
wouldn't<00:01:05.549> recommend<00:01:05.850> it<00:01:06.119> at<00:01:06.210> all<00:01:06.420> it<00:01:06.659> is

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
wouldn't recommend it at all it is

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.719 
wouldn't recommend it at all it is
possible<00:01:07.680> but<00:01:08.070> I<00:01:08.130> wouldn't<00:01:08.430> be<00:01:08.549> cutting

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
possible but I wouldn't be cutting

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.149 
possible but I wouldn't be cutting
through<00:01:09.119> metal<00:01:09.510> and<00:01:09.840> risking<00:01:10.439> ruining<00:01:10.979> my

through metal and risking ruining my
current<00:01:11.610> SIM<00:01:11.850> card<00:01:12.119> if<00:01:12.360> you<00:01:12.990> look<00:01:13.200> at<00:01:13.409> the

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
current SIM card if you look at the

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.520 
current SIM card if you look at the

other micro SIM card it is in fact

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.100 
other micro SIM card it is in fact

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
possible to cut around it at your own

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.830 
possible to cut around it at your own
risk<00:01:19.409> of<00:01:19.680> course<00:01:19.920> and<00:01:20.189> cut<00:01:20.970> down<00:01:21.210> to<00:01:21.630> the

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
my previous video just so there is no

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.080 
my previous video just so there is no
confusion<00:01:34.110> at<00:01:34.409> all<00:01:34.619> if<00:01:34.950> it<00:01:35.340> was<00:01:35.430> me<00:01:35.670> I<00:01:35.850> would

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
confusion at all if it was me I would

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.789 
confusion at all if it was me I would
still<00:01:36.390> be<00:01:36.540> ordering<00:01:36.930> a<00:01:37.049> new<00:01:37.079> nano<00:01:37.409> SIM<00:01:37.770> card

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
still be ordering a new nano SIM card

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.399 
still be ordering a new nano SIM card
just<00:01:38.640> to<00:01:38.759> avoid<00:01:39.090> all<00:01:39.420> of<00:01:39.479> the<00:01:39.840> hassle<00:01:40.350> of

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
just to avoid all of the hassle of

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.319 
just to avoid all of the hassle of
actually<00:01:40.740> cutting<00:01:40.920> it<00:01:41.220> down<00:01:41.250> but<00:01:41.970> of<00:01:42.060> course

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
actually cutting it down but of course

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.179 
actually cutting it down but of course
as<00:01:42.540> I<00:01:42.570> say<00:01:42.810> at<00:01:42.869> your<00:01:42.960> own<00:01:43.200> risk<00:01:43.439> you<00:01:43.680> can<00:01:43.950> cut

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
as I say at your own risk you can cut

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.010 
as I say at your own risk you can cut
down<00:01:44.399> if<00:01:44.549> you<00:01:44.640> want<00:01:44.909> I've<00:01:45.149> done<00:01:45.720> it<00:01:45.840> previously

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
down if you want I've done it previously

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.980 
down if you want I've done it previously
and<00:01:46.649> it<00:01:46.770> does<00:01:46.950> work<00:01:47.220> extremely<00:01:48.119> well<00:01:48.390> so

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
and it does work extremely well so

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.270 
and it does work extremely well so
thanks<00:01:49.200> very<00:01:49.259> much<00:01:49.530> for<00:01:49.710> watching<00:01:49.979> this<00:01:50.100> video
