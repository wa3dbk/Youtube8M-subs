00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
of the a few above your concern and if

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.110 
of the a few above your concern and if
you<00:02:29.850> blow<00:02:30.780> you<00:02:31.520> and<00:02:32.520> as<00:02:32.610> you<00:02:32.700> can<00:02:32.820> tell<00:02:32.850> a<00:02:33.000> lot

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
you blow you and as you can tell a lot

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.430 
you blow you and as you can tell a lot
of<00:02:33.270> the<00:02:33.360> ships<00:02:33.600> actually<00:02:33.959> have<00:02:34.110> a<00:02:34.140> weakness

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
of the ships actually have a weakness

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:38.449 
of the ships actually have a weakness
for<00:02:35.040> the<00:02:35.760> bottoms<00:02:36.150> in<00:02:36.420> the<00:02:36.570> tops<00:02:37.250> these<00:02:38.250> are

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 
for the bottoms in the tops these are

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:41.180 
for the bottoms in the tops these are
your<00:02:38.610> armor<00:02:39.560> different<00:02:40.560> platings<00:02:40.950> of<00:02:41.070> your

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
your armor different platings of your

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:42.949 
your armor different platings of your
armor<00:02:41.490> how<00:02:41.640> thick<00:02:41.970> your<00:02:42.060> honor<00:02:42.270> is<00:02:42.570> and<00:02:42.840> how

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
armor how thick your honor is and how

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:44.390 
armor how thick your honor is and how
much<00:02:42.990> of<00:02:43.260> the<00:02:43.320> weapon<00:02:43.590> fire<00:02:43.800> will<00:02:44.070> actually

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
much of the weapon fire will actually

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.490 
much of the weapon fire will actually
take<00:02:44.580> to<00:02:44.760> get<00:02:44.880> through<00:02:45.060> it<00:02:45.270> as<00:02:46.050> you<00:02:46.170> can<00:02:46.290> tell

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
take to get through it as you can tell

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:47.990 
take to get through it as you can tell
the<00:02:46.650> center<00:02:46.920> section<00:02:47.130> and<00:02:47.370> this<00:02:47.489> has<00:02:47.700> the<00:02:47.880> most

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
the center section and this has the most

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.660 
the center section and this has the most
armor<00:02:48.480> in<00:02:48.720> the<00:02:48.750> engine<00:02:49.680> section<00:02:49.890> and<00:02:50.280> the

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
armor in the engine section and the

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.600 
armor in the engine section and the
front<00:02:50.850> section<00:02:51.090> has<00:02:51.390> the<00:02:51.510> least<00:02:52.400> so<00:02:53.400> that's

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
front section has the least so that's

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:54.920 
front section has the least so that's
where<00:02:54.060> you<00:02:54.150> can<00:02:54.270> figure<00:02:54.480> out<00:02:54.570> where<00:02:54.840> the

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
where you can figure out where the

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:56.810 
where you can figure out where the
weaknesses<00:02:55.110> weaknesses<00:02:55.890> of<00:02:56.190> your<00:02:56.310> ships<00:02:56.640> will

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:56.820 
weaknesses weaknesses of your ships will

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:59.280 
weaknesses weaknesses of your ships will
be

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:01.979 

you<00:02:59.680> can<00:02:59.799> back<00:03:00.010> out<00:03:00.189> of<00:03:00.250> this<00:03:00.780> now<00:03:01.780> if<00:03:01.900> you

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:01.989 
you can back out of this now if you

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:05.459 
you can back out of this now if you
actually<00:03:02.170> go<00:03:02.530> up<00:03:03.420> here<00:03:04.420> this<00:03:05.230> actually

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:05.469 
actually go up here this actually

00:03:05.469 --> 00:03:08.580 
actually go up here this actually
controls<00:03:06.269> what<00:03:07.269> you<00:03:07.450> can<00:03:07.659> put<00:03:08.049> in<00:03:08.079> the<00:03:08.379> front

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
controls what you can put in the front

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:12.920 
controls what you can put in the front
of<00:03:08.680> the<00:03:08.739> ship<00:03:10.170> this<00:03:11.170> is<00:03:11.319> the<00:03:11.439> middle<00:03:11.769> modules

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
of the ship this is the middle modules

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:14.970 
of the ship this is the middle modules
probably<00:03:13.930> not<00:03:14.019> a<00:03:14.049> good<00:03:14.260> idea<00:03:14.319> to<00:03:14.709> call<00:03:14.859> the

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:14.980 
probably not a good idea to call the

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:16.890 
probably not a good idea to call the
modules<00:03:15.459> it's<00:03:15.670> actually<00:03:16.060> just<00:03:16.269> a<00:03:16.390> section<00:03:16.810> in

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:16.900 
modules it's actually just a section in

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:18.929 
modules it's actually just a section in
the<00:03:17.019> middle<00:03:17.140> section<00:03:17.680> and<00:03:18.340> this<00:03:18.519> is<00:03:18.700> the

00:03:18.929 --> 00:03:18.939 
the middle section and this is the

00:03:18.939 --> 00:03:23.130 
the middle section and this is the
engine<00:03:19.180> drive<00:03:19.739> that<00:03:20.739> you<00:03:20.920> can<00:03:21.129> if<00:03:21.760> you<00:03:22.140> have

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:23.140 
engine drive that you can if you have

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:24.990 
engine drive that you can if you have
more<00:03:23.560> technology<00:03:24.340> you<00:03:24.459> can<00:03:24.609> change<00:03:24.849> the

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.000 
more technology you can change the

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.790 
more technology you can change the
engine<00:03:25.180> drive

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:27.800 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:30.110 

under<00:03:28.800> this<00:03:28.920> it<00:03:29.100> actually<00:03:29.370> gives<00:03:29.490> you<00:03:29.730> again

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
under this it actually gives you again

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:33.650 
under this it actually gives you again
all<00:03:30.390> your<00:03:30.570> armor<00:03:30.870> ratings<00:03:31.230> and<00:03:32.660> your

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:36.800 
structural rating on and on all of them

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:39.410 
structural rating on and on all of them
as<00:03:37.800> you<00:03:38.010> can<00:03:38.100> tell<00:03:38.310> the<00:03:38.610> armor<00:03:39.000> on<00:03:39.120> the<00:03:39.240> middle

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:39.420 
as you can tell the armor on the middle

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.570 
as you can tell the armor on the middle
section<00:03:40.110> is<00:03:40.260> filled<00:03:40.470> up<00:03:40.590> your<00:03:40.980> best<00:03:41.280> bet

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:41.580 
section is filled up your best bet

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:44.860 
section is filled up your best bet
followed<00:03:42.510> by<00:03:42.600> the<00:03:42.660> rear<00:03:42.990> and<00:03:43.260> then<00:03:43.950> the<00:03:44.100> front

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:44.870 
followed by the rear and then the front

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:47.630 
followed by the rear and then the front
and<00:03:45.870> again<00:03:46.050> then<00:03:46.380> change<00:03:46.650> your<00:03:46.920> weapon<00:03:47.340> sets

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:47.640 
and again then change your weapon sets

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:50.570 
and again then change your weapon sets
you<00:03:47.760> just<00:03:48.000> click<00:03:48.240> on<00:03:48.360> it<00:03:48.570> and<00:03:49.160> you<00:03:50.160> find<00:03:50.430> the

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:50.580 
you just click on it and you find the

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:52.010 
you just click on it and you find the
weapons<00:03:50.940> you<00:03:51.240> can<00:03:51.390> see<00:03:51.510> that<00:03:51.540> how<00:03:51.750> they're<00:03:51.900> all

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:52.020 
weapons you can see that how they're all

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:54.260 
weapons you can see that how they're all
connected<00:03:52.320> kind<00:03:52.800> of<00:03:52.950> sometimes<00:03:53.730> you<00:03:53.940> can<00:03:54.120> do

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:54.270 
connected kind of sometimes you can do

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:56.600 
connected kind of sometimes you can do
multiple<00:03:54.800> weapons<00:03:55.800> so<00:03:56.190> you<00:03:56.280> don't<00:03:56.430> have<00:03:56.490> to

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:56.610 
multiple weapons so you don't have to

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:02.090 
multiple weapons so you don't have to
click<00:03:56.820> every<00:03:57.000> individual<00:03:57.600> one<00:04:00.920> and<00:04:01.920> that's

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:02.100 
click every individual one and that's

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:03.950 
click every individual one and that's
all<00:04:02.280> it's<00:04:03.000> seen<00:04:03.510> a<00:04:03.540> little<00:04:03.720> bit<00:04:03.870> more

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:03.960 
all it's seen a little bit more

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:05.420 
all it's seen a little bit more
difficult<00:04:04.200> to<00:04:04.500> change<00:04:04.680> in<00:04:04.920> the<00:04:05.010> original<00:04:05.190> game

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430 
difficult to change in the original game

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:07.400 
difficult to change in the original game
but<00:04:05.790> I<00:04:06.030> guess<00:04:06.540> just<00:04:06.720> the<00:04:06.810> way<00:04:06.930> they<00:04:07.080> wanted<00:04:07.320> to

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:07.410 
but I guess just the way they wanted to

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:08.960 
but I guess just the way they wanted to
do<00:04:07.530> it

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970 
do it

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:11.270 
do it
now<00:04:09.840> a<00:04:09.870> new<00:04:10.110> feature<00:04:10.140> of<00:04:10.590> the<00:04:10.710> game<00:04:10.920> is

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 
now a new feature of the game is

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.100 
now a new feature of the game is
actually<00:04:11.880> what's<00:04:12.060> called<00:04:12.150> modules<00:04:12.540> and

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:13.110 
actually what's called modules and

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:14.690 
actually what's called modules and
that's<00:04:13.530> what<00:04:13.680> these<00:04:13.800> little<00:04:14.070> boxes<00:04:14.250> are<00:04:14.580> they

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 
that's what these little boxes are they

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:17.390 
that's what these little boxes are they
have<00:04:14.820> a<00:04:14.850> circle<00:04:15.300> with<00:04:16.079> a<00:04:16.110> cross<00:04:16.170> film<00:04:16.739> these

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400 
have a circle with a cross film these

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:19.810 
have a circle with a cross film these
are<00:04:17.609> modules<00:04:18.090> that<00:04:18.180> you<00:04:18.299> can<00:04:18.510> add<00:04:18.750> to<00:04:19.320> your

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:19.820 
are modules that you can add to your

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:22.099 
are modules that you can add to your
ship<00:04:20.820> to<00:04:20.850> make<00:04:21.209> them<00:04:21.390> better<00:04:21.570> and<00:04:21.810> it's<00:04:21.959> been

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:22.109 
ship to make them better and it's been

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:24.650 
ship to make them better and it's been
suspicious<00:04:22.950> specific<00:04:23.790> area<00:04:24.120> and<00:04:24.330> I've

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:24.660 
suspicious specific area and I've

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:26.240 
suspicious specific area and I've
learned<00:04:24.840> what<00:04:25.080> most<00:04:25.230> of<00:04:25.410> them<00:04:25.530> are<00:04:25.740> at<00:04:26.040> this

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.250 
learned what most of them are at this

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:29.570 
learned what most of them are at this
point<00:04:26.520> we'll<00:04:27.240> go<00:04:27.390> over<00:04:27.420> it<00:04:27.980> the<00:04:28.980> camel<00:04:29.370> is

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:29.580 
point we'll go over it the camel is

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:32.960 
point we'll go over it the camel is
actually<00:04:30.710> more<00:04:31.710> supplies<00:04:32.100> so<00:04:32.490> to<00:04:32.550> increase

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:32.970 
actually more supplies so to increase

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:34.400 
actually more supplies so to increase
the<00:04:33.120> supplies<00:04:33.480> of<00:04:33.720> your<00:04:33.840> ship<00:04:34.020> as<00:04:34.200> you<00:04:34.290> can

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:34.410 
the supplies of your ship as you can

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:35.870 
the supplies of your ship as you can
tell<00:04:34.560> my<00:04:34.680> supplies<00:04:35.040> just<00:04:35.310> jumped<00:04:35.610> up<00:04:35.700> right

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:35.880 
tell my supplies just jumped up right

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:41.570 
tell my supplies just jumped up right
there<00:04:36.800> see<00:04:37.800> how<00:04:37.980> 1<00:04:38.160> to<00:04:38.280> 100<00:04:38.760> is<00:04:38.850> at<00:04:38.940> 100<00:04:39.300> ml<00:04:40.460> 1<00:04:41.460> 2

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:41.580 
there see how 1 to 100 is at 100 ml 1 2

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:44.390 
there see how 1 to 100 is at 100 ml 1 2
175<00:04:42.120> so<00:04:42.540> that<00:04:42.660> increases<00:04:43.140> your<00:04:43.260> supply<00:04:43.620> radius

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:44.400 
175 so that increases your supply radius

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:48.170 
175 so that increases your supply radius
I'm<00:04:45.270> not<00:04:45.420> sure<00:04:45.690> I'm<00:04:46.100> I'm<00:04:47.100> list<00:04:47.430> on<00:04:47.610> these<00:04:47.940> and

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:48.180 
I'm not sure I'm I'm list on these and

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:50.300 
I'm not sure I'm I'm list on these and
the<00:04:48.300> cruisers<00:04:48.570> you<00:04:48.870> have<00:04:49.290> enough<00:04:49.770> space<00:04:49.800> for

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:50.310 
the cruisers you have enough space for

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:55.350 
the cruisers you have enough space for
three<00:04:51.590> modules

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:55.360 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:57.970 

I'll<00:04:55.960> show<00:04:56.229> you

00:04:57.970 --> 00:04:57.980 
I'll show you

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:00.700 
I'll show you
I'm<00:04:58.580> this<00:04:58.730> particular<00:04:59.000> ship<00:04:59.390> the<00:04:59.990> modules<00:05:00.410> fit

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:00.710 
I'm this particular ship the modules fit

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:03.850 
I'm this particular ship the modules fit
right<00:05:01.220> here<00:05:01.520> these<00:05:02.300> two<00:05:02.360> spots<00:05:02.870> will<00:05:03.440> open<00:05:03.740> up

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:03.860 
right here these two spots will open up

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:06.130 
right here these two spots will open up
here<00:05:04.070> it<00:05:05.060> would<00:05:05.180> actually<00:05:05.300> go<00:05:05.570> right<00:05:05.750> here<00:05:06.050> in

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:06.140 
here it would actually go right here in

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:09.120 
here it would actually go right here in
here<00:05:06.430> then<00:05:07.430> there's<00:05:07.580> an<00:05:07.790> engine<00:05:08.120> module

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:09.130 
here then there's an engine module

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:13.180 
here then there's an engine module
there's<00:05:10.130> an<00:05:10.250> engine<00:05:10.520> module<00:05:10.810> and<00:05:12.190> there's

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:13.190 
there's an engine module and there's

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:15.190 
there's an engine module and there's
usually<00:05:13.550> a<00:05:13.790> middle<00:05:14.180> module<00:05:14.630> or<00:05:14.840> less<00:05:14.990> that's

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:15.200 
usually a middle module or less that's

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:17.590 
usually a middle module or less that's
just<00:05:15.670> know<00:05:16.670> there's<00:05:16.970> only<00:05:17.090> three<00:05:17.360> on<00:05:17.480> the

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:17.600 
just know there's only three on the

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:19.900 
just know there's only three on the
cruiser

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:19.910 
cruiser

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:23.410 

so<00:05:20.510> let's<00:05:20.690> go<00:05:20.810> back<00:05:20.840> over<00:05:21.140> it<00:05:21.370> all<00:05:22.370> right<00:05:22.490> the

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:23.420 
so let's go back over it all right the

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:29.210 
so let's go back over it all right the
camel<00:05:23.840> is<00:05:24.050> that<00:05:24.800> like<00:05:24.890> I<00:05:25.010> said<00:05:25.220> supply

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:29.220 

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:33.030 

the<00:05:30.220> Hannibal<00:05:30.700> is<00:05:31.140> actually<00:05:32.140> only<00:05:32.350> useful<00:05:32.680> if

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:33.040 
the Hannibal is actually only useful if

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:35.850 
the Hannibal is actually only useful if
you<00:05:33.220> on<00:05:33.460> your<00:05:33.790> cnc<00:05:34.270> ship<00:05:34.720> and<00:05:35.380> that<00:05:35.500> it's<00:05:35.680> the

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:35.860 
you on your cnc ship and that it's the

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:37.890 
you on your cnc ship and that it's the
save<00:05:36.220> your<00:05:36.370> Admiral<00:05:36.730> in<00:05:36.850> case<00:05:37.030> your<00:05:37.300> ship<00:05:37.570> gets

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:37.900 
save your Admiral in case your ship gets

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:44.060 
save your Admiral in case your ship gets
destroyed

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:44.070 

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:47.810 

Professor<00:05:44.940> X<00:05:45.210> which<00:05:45.930> is<00:05:45.960> what<00:05:46.140> I<00:05:46.170> just<00:05:46.410> added

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:47.820 
Professor X which is what I just added

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:51.860 
Professor X which is what I just added
actually<00:05:48.750> adds<00:05:49.050> more<00:05:50.030> energy<00:05:51.030> I<00:05:51.060> believe<00:05:51.600> me

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:51.870 
actually adds more energy I believe me

00:05:51.870 --> 00:06:02.159 
actually adds more energy I believe me
do<00:05:52.050> that<00:05:52.200> again

00:06:02.159 --> 00:06:02.169 

00:06:02.169 --> 00:06:04.320 

actually<00:06:02.889> professor<00:06:03.189> x<00:06:03.639> obviously<00:06:04.210> is

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:04.330 
actually professor x obviously is

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:06.929 
actually professor x obviously is
something<00:06:04.629> to<00:06:04.689> do<00:06:04.810> with<00:06:04.990> like<00:06:05.139> science<00:06:05.939> I'm

00:06:06.929 --> 00:06:06.939 
something to do with like science I'm

00:06:06.939 --> 00:06:08.580 
something to do with like science I'm
not<00:06:07.389> quite<00:06:07.659> sure<00:06:07.689> that's<00:06:08.050> the<00:06:08.110> only<00:06:08.169> one<00:06:08.469> I'm

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:08.590 
not quite sure that's the only one I'm

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:11.640 
not quite sure that's the only one I'm
not<00:06:08.919> sure<00:06:09.189> about<00:06:09.340> yet<00:06:09.990> point<00:06:10.990> defenses<00:06:11.409> just

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:11.650 
not sure about yet point defenses just

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:13.679 
not sure about yet point defenses just
add<00:06:11.800> more<00:06:12.069> point<00:06:12.400> defenses<00:06:12.819> to<00:06:13.029> your<00:06:13.240> actual

00:06:13.679 --> 00:06:13.689 
add more point defenses to your actual

00:06:13.689 --> 00:06:21.230 
add more point defenses to your actual
ship

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:21.240 

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:23.689 

and<00:06:21.509> there's<00:06:21.930> also<00:06:22.259> one<00:06:22.560> more<00:06:22.620> module<00:06:23.220> I<00:06:23.460> don't

00:06:23.689 --> 00:06:23.699 
and there's also one more module I don't

00:06:23.699 --> 00:06:26.270 
and there's also one more module I don't
know<00:06:23.880> why<00:06:24.090> it's<00:06:24.330> not<00:06:24.389> on<00:06:24.569> the<00:06:24.900> Lear<00:06:25.080> one<00:06:25.349> it's

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:26.280 
know why it's not on the Lear one it's

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:30.589 
know why it's not on the Lear one it's
called<00:06:26.580> Semper<00:06:26.970> Fi<00:06:27.000> and<00:06:27.770> that<00:06:28.770> is<00:06:29.069> actually<00:06:29.849> to

00:06:30.589 --> 00:06:30.599 
called Semper Fi and that is actually to

00:06:30.599 --> 00:06:32.900 
called Semper Fi and that is actually to
add<00:06:30.720> marine<00:06:31.139> see<00:06:31.440> a<00:06:31.470> ship<00:06:31.770> for<00:06:31.979> boarding<00:06:32.370> or<00:06:32.550> to

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:32.910 
add marine see a ship for boarding or to

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:36.110 
add marine see a ship for boarding or to
defend<00:06:33.449> defend<00:06:34.110> from<00:06:34.669> boarding<00:06:35.669> on<00:06:35.789> your<00:06:35.970> own

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:36.120 
defend defend from boarding on your own

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:38.570 
defend defend from boarding on your own
ship<00:06:36.620> like<00:06:37.620> I<00:06:37.710> said<00:06:37.770> there's<00:06:38.160> two<00:06:38.370> different

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:38.580 
ship like I said there's two different

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:40.100 
ship like I said there's two different
modules<00:06:39.090> on<00:06:39.240> this<00:06:39.419> so<00:06:39.509> I<00:06:39.599> could<00:06:39.750> put<00:06:39.840> a<00:06:39.900> point

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:40.110 
modules on this so I could put a point

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:43.640 
modules on this so I could put a point
defense<00:06:40.470> system<00:06:40.830> there<00:06:42.080> so<00:06:43.080> on<00:06:43.199> the<00:06:43.289> second

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:43.650 
defense system there so on the second

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:46.129 
defense system there so on the second
one<00:06:43.770> i'll<00:06:44.340> add<00:06:44.729> you<00:06:45.240> could<00:06:45.389> add<00:06:45.479> another<00:06:45.509> camel

00:06:46.129 --> 00:06:46.139 
one i'll add you could add another camel

00:06:46.139 --> 00:06:50.510 
one i'll add you could add another camel
to<00:06:46.229> make<00:06:46.380> your<00:06:48.349> supply<00:06:49.349> go<00:06:49.560> up<00:06:49.770> or<00:06:50.039> you<00:06:50.160> can<00:06:50.340> add

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:50.520 
to make your supply go up or you can add

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:53.120 
to make your supply go up or you can add
the<00:06:50.729> shuttle<00:06:51.300> for<00:06:51.509> your<00:06:51.860> thing<00:06:52.860> you<00:06:52.889> can

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:53.130 
the shuttle for your thing you can

00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:58.300 
the shuttle for your thing you can
actually<00:06:53.280> add<00:06:53.520> anything<00:06:53.699> you<00:06:53.909> want<00:06:54.229> I'll<00:06:55.229> add

00:06:58.300 --> 00:06:58.310 

00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:00.880 

Professor<00:06:58.850> X<00:06:59.060> so<00:06:59.900> now<00:07:00.020> I<00:07:00.050> have<00:07:00.170> to<00:07:00.560> model

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:00.890 
Professor X so now I have to model

00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:02.440 
Professor X so now I have to model
different<00:07:01.190> modules<00:07:01.610> on<00:07:01.730> my<00:07:01.850> ship<00:07:02.060> right<00:07:02.270> there

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:02.450 
different modules on my ship right there

00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:04.720 
different modules on my ship right there
as<00:07:02.750> you<00:07:02.900> can<00:07:02.990> see<00:07:03.230> will<00:07:04.130> go<00:07:04.250> to<00:07:04.310> the<00:07:04.430> weapon

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:04.730 
as you can see will go to the weapon

00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:06.410 
as you can see will go to the weapon
test

00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:06.420 
test

00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:10.959 
test
see<00:07:07.020> them<00:07:07.200> the<00:07:07.380> graphics<00:07:07.890> absolutely<00:07:08.760> amazing

00:07:10.959 --> 00:07:10.969 

00:07:10.969 --> 00:07:13.070 

absolutely<00:07:11.969> amazing<00:07:12.330> I<00:07:12.479> just<00:07:12.629> wish<00:07:12.749> the<00:07:12.930> game

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:13.080 
absolutely amazing I just wish the game

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:14.659 
absolutely amazing I just wish the game
was<00:07:13.259> released<00:07:13.289> in<00:07:13.770> a<00:07:13.830> better<00:07:14.009> state<00:07:14.310> and<00:07:14.550> it

00:07:14.659 --> 00:07:14.669 
was released in a better state and it

00:07:14.669 --> 00:07:19.429 
was released in a better state and it
was<00:07:14.819> but<00:07:15.150> it<00:07:15.409> wasn't<00:07:16.699> that's<00:07:17.699> about<00:07:17.999> it<00:07:18.439> now

00:07:19.429 --> 00:07:19.439 
was but it wasn't that's about it now

00:07:19.439 --> 00:07:21.140 
was but it wasn't that's about it now
obviously<00:07:19.620> if<00:07:19.860> you<00:07:19.979> add<00:07:20.129> modules<00:07:20.639> see<00:07:20.819> a<00:07:20.849> ship

00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:21.150 
obviously if you add modules see a ship

00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:24.230 
obviously if you add modules see a ship
you<00:07:22.110> could<00:07:22.289> actually

00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:24.240 
you could actually

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:27.469 
you could actually
come<00:07:24.630> make<00:07:24.810> it<00:07:24.930> costs<00:07:25.139> more<00:07:25.440> so<00:07:26.099> it's<00:07:26.610> not<00:07:26.880> i'm

00:07:27.469 --> 00:07:27.479 
come make it costs more so it's not i'm

00:07:27.479 --> 00:07:29.530 
come make it costs more so it's not i'm
not<00:07:27.539> sure<00:07:27.870> why<00:07:28.110> i<00:07:28.139> don't<00:07:28.410> have<00:07:28.590> the

00:07:29.530 --> 00:07:29.540 
not sure why i don't have the

00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:31.840 
not sure why i don't have the
the<00:07:29.990> third<00:07:30.230> off<00:07:30.440> third<00:07:30.830> module<00:07:31.070> like<00:07:31.520> on<00:07:31.670> the

00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:31.850 
the third off third module like on the

00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:34.390 
the third off third module like on the
human<00:07:32.690> ships<00:07:32.960> but<00:07:33.230> it's<00:07:33.860> actually<00:07:34.040> right

00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:34.400 
human ships but it's actually right

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:36.070 
human ships but it's actually right
there<00:07:34.640> so<00:07:34.880> I<00:07:34.910> don't<00:07:35.270> know<00:07:35.420> why<00:07:35.570> I<00:07:35.600> can't<00:07:35.900> change

00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:36.080 
there so I don't know why I can't change

00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:36.970 
there so I don't know why I can't change
it<00:07:36.320> but

00:07:36.970 --> 00:07:36.980 
it but

00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:38.860 
it but
you<00:07:37.490> can<00:07:37.730> change<00:07:37.940> it<00:07:38.150> in<00:07:38.240> some<00:07:38.750> it's

00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:38.870 
you can change it in some it's

00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:39.970 
you can change it in some it's
probably<00:07:39.230> something<00:07:39.440> to<00:07:39.530> do<00:07:39.620> with<00:07:39.650> a<00:07:39.800> year

00:07:39.970 --> 00:07:39.980 
probably something to do with a year

00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:42.460 
probably something to do with a year
that<00:07:40.160> I<00:07:40.190> haven't<00:07:40.460> figured<00:07:40.700> out<00:07:40.850> yet<00:07:41.290> all<00:07:42.290> right

00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:42.470 
that I haven't figured out yet all right

00:07:42.470 --> 00:07:46.240 
that I haven't figured out yet all right
have<00:07:43.460> a<00:07:43.490> good<00:07:43.610> night<00:07:43.760> bye
