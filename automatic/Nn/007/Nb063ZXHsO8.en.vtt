did<00:03:27.870> some<00:03:27.930> incline<00:03:28.860> dumbbell<00:03:29.430> chest<00:03:29.670> press

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
did some incline dumbbell chest press

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:32.600 
did some incline dumbbell chest press
haven't<00:03:30.810> done<00:03:30.930> incline<00:03:31.260> work<00:03:31.470> for<00:03:31.680> a<00:03:31.739> while<00:03:32.280> so

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:32.610 
haven't done incline work for a while so

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:36.229 
haven't done incline work for a while so
I<00:03:32.670> thought<00:03:32.700> do<00:03:33.120> some<00:03:33.390> I<00:03:34.489> did<00:03:35.489> three<00:03:35.790> sets<00:03:36.120> of

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:36.239 
I thought do some I did three sets of

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:38.240 
I thought do some I did three sets of
about<00:03:36.510> twelve<00:03:36.989> or<00:03:37.170> so<00:03:37.230> reps<00:03:37.560> it<00:03:37.739> didn't<00:03:38.130> go

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
about twelve or so reps it didn't go

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:41.509 
about twelve or so reps it didn't go
very<00:03:38.280> heavy<00:03:38.730> I<00:03:38.820> think<00:03:39.090> these<00:03:39.329> are<00:03:39.600> I<00:03:40.560> can't

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:41.519 
very heavy I think these are I can't

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:42.949 
very heavy I think these are I can't
remember<00:03:41.700> now<00:03:41.970> possibly<00:03:42.480> for<00:03:42.690> weekly<00:03:42.930> a

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
remember now possibly for weekly a

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:46.580 
remember now possibly for weekly a
dumbbell<00:03:43.380> so<00:03:43.560> that's<00:03:43.709> about<00:03:44.570> 90<00:03:45.570> pounds<00:03:45.600> or<00:03:46.380> so

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
dumbbell so that's about 90 pounds or so

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:49.550 
dumbbell so that's about 90 pounds or so
um<00:03:46.970> I<00:03:47.970> just<00:03:48.120> I'm<00:03:48.870> influence<00:03:49.260> they<00:03:49.350> fell<00:03:49.470> it

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
um I just I'm influence they fell it

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:50.990 
um I just I'm influence they fell it
almost<00:03:49.799> like<00:03:49.980> flies<00:03:50.280> i<00:03:50.459> was<00:03:50.579> coming<00:03:50.820> fairly

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
almost like flies i was coming fairly

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.850 
almost like flies i was coming fairly
wide<00:03:51.299> with<00:03:51.480> those<00:03:51.510> are<00:03:52.110> then<00:03:52.350> went<00:03:52.530> on<00:03:52.590> to<00:03:52.620> some

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:52.860 
wide with those are then went on to some

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:54.770 
wide with those are then went on to some
actual<00:03:53.160> flies<00:03:53.340> again<00:03:53.549> on<00:03:53.910> an<00:03:54.000> incline<00:03:54.120> again

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
actual flies again on an incline again

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:56.600 
actual flies again on an incline again
trying<00:03:55.019> to<00:03:55.079> inclusive<00:03:55.350> incline<00:03:55.769> work<00:03:55.980> and<00:03:56.340> i

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:56.610 
trying to inclusive incline work and i

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:58.699 
trying to inclusive incline work and i
went<00:03:57.180> very<00:03:57.450> light<00:03:57.720> with<00:03:57.870> these<00:03:58.079> I<00:03:58.110> think<00:03:58.590> these

00:03:58.699 --> 00:03:58.709 
went very light with these I think these

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:01.640 
went very light with these I think these
are<00:03:58.769> only<00:03:59.480> these<00:04:00.480> aren't<00:04:00.720> even<00:04:00.900> 20<00:04:01.200> so<00:04:01.410> I<00:04:01.440> don't

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 
are only these aren't even 20 so I don't

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:03.620 
are only these aren't even 20 so I don't
know<00:04:01.709> what<00:04:01.799> this<00:04:01.890> is<00:04:01.950> that<00:04:02.280> I<00:04:02.310> mean<00:04:02.630> that's

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:03.630 
know what this is that I mean that's

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:07.490 
know what this is that I mean that's
gotta<00:04:03.930> be<00:04:03.989> like<00:04:04.320> I'd<00:04:04.680> know<00:04:05.030> 45<00:04:06.380> pounds<00:04:07.380> or

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 
gotta be like I'd know 45 pounds or

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.860 
gotta be like I'd know 45 pounds or
something<00:04:07.680> very<00:04:08.280> very<00:04:08.489> light<00:04:08.850> more<00:04:09.720> than<00:04:09.840> a

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 
something very very light more than a

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:10.970 
something very very light more than a
polygraph<00:04:10.260> a<00:04:10.290> few<00:04:10.470> pounds<00:04:10.680> that<00:04:10.769> should<00:04:10.859> be<00:04:10.950> a

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
polygraph a few pounds that should be a

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:13.430 
polygraph a few pounds that should be a
very<00:04:11.070> light<00:04:11.430> and<00:04:11.640> I<00:04:11.970> did<00:04:12.570> three<00:04:12.870> sets<00:04:13.170> of<00:04:13.290> eight

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:13.440 
very light and I did three sets of eight

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:16.490 
very light and I did three sets of eight
again<00:04:13.829> about<00:04:14.190> 12<00:04:14.549> reps<00:04:14.790> here<00:04:15.000> um<00:04:15.320> but<00:04:16.320> to<00:04:16.440> be

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
again about 12 reps here um but to be

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:17.870 
again about 12 reps here um but to be
honest<00:04:16.709> the<00:04:16.739> whole<00:04:16.979> time<00:04:17.250> I<00:04:17.310> was<00:04:17.430> doing<00:04:17.760> these

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
honest the whole time I was doing these

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:19.880 
honest the whole time I was doing these
I<00:04:17.940> was<00:04:18.479> just<00:04:18.690> really<00:04:18.959> really<00:04:19.289> annoyed<00:04:19.709> at

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:19.890 
I was just really really annoyed at

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:21.770 
I was just really really annoyed at
myself<00:04:19.979> I'm<00:04:20.459> annoyed<00:04:20.940> at<00:04:21.120> myself<00:04:21.180> because<00:04:21.479> I

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:21.780 
myself I'm annoyed at myself because I

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:24.409 
myself I'm annoyed at myself because I
think<00:04:22.049> in<00:04:22.560> hindsight<00:04:23.039> and<00:04:23.550> I<00:04:23.640> thought<00:04:23.880> even<00:04:24.330> at

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:24.419 
think in hindsight and I thought even at

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:25.370 
think in hindsight and I thought even at
the<00:04:24.510> time<00:04:24.720> I<00:04:24.750> kind<00:04:25.050> of<00:04:25.080> thought<00:04:25.200> I<00:04:25.260> should

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:25.380 
the time I kind of thought I should

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:26.840 
the time I kind of thought I should
probably<00:04:25.620> just<00:04:25.919> stick<00:04:26.099> to<00:04:26.280> my<00:04:26.370> session

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:26.850 
probably just stick to my session

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:29.750 
probably just stick to my session
I'm<00:04:26.970> very<00:04:27.470> bad<00:04:28.470> at<00:04:28.530> being<00:04:28.800> patient<00:04:29.130> I<00:04:29.490> wanted

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:29.760 
I'm very bad at being patient I wanted

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:30.830 
I'm very bad at being patient I wanted
to<00:04:29.820> try<00:04:30.030> and<00:04:30.150> just<00:04:30.300> do<00:04:30.420> it<00:04:30.510> now<00:04:30.630> I'm<00:04:30.690> always

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:30.840 
to try and just do it now I'm always

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:32.720 
to try and just do it now I'm always
wanted<00:04:31.140> to<00:04:31.260> always<00:04:31.590> try<00:04:31.830> to<00:04:31.890> do<00:04:32.190> things<00:04:32.370> now

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:32.730 
wanted to always try to do things now

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:36.950 
wanted to always try to do things now
and<00:04:33.060> not<00:04:33.750> wait<00:04:33.780> but<00:04:35.150> I<00:04:36.150> say<00:04:36.600> it's<00:04:36.750> a<00:04:36.810> lesson

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:36.960 
and not wait but I say it's a lesson

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:38.150 
and not wait but I say it's a lesson
learn<00:04:37.230> i'll<00:04:37.350> probably<00:04:37.530> do<00:04:37.740> it<00:04:37.800> again<00:04:37.890> in<00:04:38.100> the

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:38.160 
learn i'll probably do it again in the

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.160 
learn i'll probably do it again in the
future<00:04:38.280> but<00:04:38.550> it's<00:04:38.610> just<00:04:38.880> irritating<00:04:39.030> but<00:04:39.780> like

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:40.170 
future but it's just irritating but like

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:42.700 
future but it's just irritating but like
i<00:04:40.200> said<00:04:40.290> nevermind<00:04:40.950> i<00:04:41.100> know<00:04:41.160> is<00:04:41.580> there<00:04:42.090> in<00:04:42.330> the

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:42.710 
i said nevermind i know is there in the

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:45.350 
i said nevermind i know is there in the
very<00:04:43.710> close<00:04:44.130> future<00:04:44.400> am<00:04:44.760> I<00:04:44.940> then<00:04:45.060> did<00:04:45.300> some

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:45.360 
very close future am I then did some

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:50.870 
very close future am I then did some
bent<00:04:46.080> over<00:04:46.560> cable<00:04:47.100> rows<00:04:48.440> back<00:04:49.440> to<00:04:49.650> the<00:04:49.740> wall<00:04:49.920> is

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:50.880 
bent over cable rows back to the wall is

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:55.490 
bent over cable rows back to the wall is
essential<00:04:51.660> when<00:04:51.810> doing<00:04:52.200> this<00:04:52.440> I<00:04:53.870> did<00:04:54.870> three

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:55.500 
essential when doing this I did three

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:57.800 
essential when doing this I did three
sets<00:04:56.040> of<00:04:56.250> I<00:04:56.790> think<00:04:56.880> I<00:04:57.210> did<00:04:57.360> quite<00:04:57.540> a<00:04:57.600> lot<00:04:57.660> of

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:57.810 
sets of I think I did quite a lot of

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:00.710 
sets of I think I did quite a lot of
reps<00:04:57.930> I<00:04:58.050> did<00:04:58.230> about<00:04:58.400> 14<00:04:59.400> or<00:04:59.550> 15<00:04:59.730> almost<00:05:00.210> sets<00:05:00.600> i

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:00.720 
reps I did about 14 or 15 almost sets i

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:02.180 
reps I did about 14 or 15 almost sets i
kept<00:05:00.930> misjudging<00:05:01.500> the<00:05:01.530> way<00:05:01.680> I<00:05:01.710> kept<00:05:02.040> feeling

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:02.190 
kept misjudging the way I kept feeling

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:04.970 
kept misjudging the way I kept feeling
like<00:05:02.400> I<00:05:02.810> was<00:05:03.810> going<00:05:04.170> to<00:05:04.230> be<00:05:04.320> fatiguing<00:05:04.680> so<00:05:04.920> I

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:04.980 
like I was going to be fatiguing so I

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:06.320 
like I was going to be fatiguing so I
put<00:05:05.160> the<00:05:05.250> weight<00:05:05.400> down<00:05:05.430> and<00:05:05.850> it<00:05:05.940> kept<00:05:06.150> being
