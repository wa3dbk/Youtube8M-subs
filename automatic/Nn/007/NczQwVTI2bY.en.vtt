we've<00:00:06.930> got<00:00:06.960> to<00:00:07.140> plug<00:00:07.350> it<00:00:07.470> into<00:00:07.560> a<00:00:07.680> p3<00:00:08.189> 50<00:00:08.580> power

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
we've got to plug it into a p3 50 power

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.030 
we've got to plug it into a p3 50 power

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
cable for the main charge and I'll plug

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.300 
cable for the main charge and I'll plug
that<00:00:19.680> into<00:00:19.890> the<00:00:20.070> aya<00:00:20.189> charger<00:00:20.699> right<00:00:20.850> here<00:00:22.310> the

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
me to plug in 6 3 s batteries so I've

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.799 
me to plug in 6 3 s batteries so I've
done<00:00:37.469> a<00:00:37.500> lot<00:00:37.680> of<00:00:37.739> batteries<00:00:38.250> here<00:00:38.520> all<00:00:38.700> 3<00:00:39.629> s

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
done a lot of batteries here all 3 s

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.430 
done a lot of batteries here all 3 s
batteries<00:00:40.320> but<00:00:41.840> different<00:00:42.840> capacities<00:00:43.410> you

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
batteries but different capacities you

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.350 
batteries but different capacities you
can<00:00:43.710> use<00:00:43.829> any<00:00:43.980> capacity<00:00:44.550> as<00:00:44.640> long<00:00:44.850> as<00:00:45.030> they're

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
can use any capacity as long as they're

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.900 
can use any capacity as long as they're
not<00:00:46.079> fully<00:00:46.410> charged<00:00:46.890> and<00:00:47.039> fully<00:00:47.309> discharged

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
not fully charged and fully discharged

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.220 
not fully charged and fully discharged
you<00:00:48.000> want<00:00:48.180> to<00:00:48.239> near<00:00:48.420> the<00:00:48.450> same<00:00:48.750> state<00:00:49.110> of

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
you want to near the same state of

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.770 
you want to near the same state of
charge<00:00:49.530> so<00:00:50.000> I'll<00:00:51.000> take<00:00:51.239> and<00:00:51.420> just<00:00:51.570> start

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
charge so I'll take and just start

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:57.880 
charge so I'll take and just start
plugging<00:00:51.989> in<00:00:52.289> the<00:00:52.379> main<00:00:52.590> charge<00:00:52.890> leads<00:00:53.250> here

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:57.890 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:00.319 

cable<00:00:58.890> comes<00:00:59.100> with<00:00:59.309> little<00:00:59.579> protective<00:01:00.030> caps

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
cable comes with little protective caps

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.330 
cable comes with little protective caps
to<00:01:00.570> make<00:01:00.750> sure<00:01:00.930> that<00:01:01.140> you<00:01:01.559> don't<00:01:01.710> short<00:01:02.070> some

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
to make sure that you don't short some

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.719 
to make sure that you don't short some
of<00:01:02.430> these<00:01:02.520> connectors<00:01:03.000> together<00:01:04.460> when<00:01:05.460> some

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
of these connectors together when some

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:15.260 
of these connectors together when some
are<00:01:05.850> plugged<00:01:06.119> at<00:01:06.299> some<00:01:06.510> round<00:01:06.750> plug<00:01:07.049> here<00:01:14.270> so

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
are plugged at some round plug here so

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.999 
are plugged at some round plug here so
now<00:01:15.420> that<00:01:15.509> I've<00:01:15.689> got<00:01:15.900> all<00:01:16.080> 6<00:01:16.439> of<00:01:16.560> these<00:01:16.710> guys

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
now that I've got all 6 of these guys

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.969 
now that I've got all 6 of these guys
plugged<00:01:17.490> in<00:01:17.729> I<00:01:18.259> just<00:01:19.259> need<00:01:19.409> to<00:01:19.530> plug<00:01:19.740> in<00:01:19.950> the

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
plugged in I just need to plug in the

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.039 
plugged in I just need to plug in the
main<00:01:20.250> charge<00:01:20.520> or<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.150> balance<00:01:21.330> charge<00:01:21.720> lead

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
main charge or the balance charge lead

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.149 
main charge or the balance charge lead
adapters<00:01:22.560> here<00:01:23.960> so<00:01:24.960> the<00:01:25.229> order<00:01:25.500> you<00:01:25.710> do<00:01:25.979> these

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
adapters here so the order you do these

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.880 
adapters here so the order you do these
connections<00:01:26.790> doesn't<00:01:27.509> matter<00:01:27.689> but<00:01:28.439> I<00:01:28.530> prefer

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
connections doesn't matter but I prefer

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.609 
connections doesn't matter but I prefer
to<00:01:29.009> do<00:01:29.130> the<00:01:29.280> main<00:01:29.460> charge<00:01:29.759> leads<00:01:30.119> first<00:01:30.619> so

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
to do the main charge leads first so

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.440 
to do the main charge leads first so
that<00:01:31.799> they<00:01:31.950> can<00:01:32.130> equalize<00:01:32.549> out<00:01:32.820> voltage<00:01:33.270> is<00:01:33.420> a

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
that they can equalize out voltage is a

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.719 
that they can equalize out voltage is a
little<00:01:33.810> bit<00:01:33.900> better<00:01:34.250> through<00:01:35.250> the<00:01:35.280> larger

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
little bit better through the larger

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:44.050 
little bit better through the larger
gauge<00:01:35.909> Gable's<00:01:39.409> there<00:01:40.409> we<00:01:40.590> go<00:01:41.450> red<00:01:42.450> right<00:01:42.630> here

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060 
gauge Gable's there we go red right here

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:46.550 
gauge Gable's there we go red right here
and<00:01:45.060> then<00:01:45.479> just<00:01:45.780> hold<00:01:45.960> the<00:01:46.110> enter<00:01:46.380> button

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
and then just hold the enter button

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:53.810 
and then just hold the enter button
start<00:01:47.070> the<00:01:47.189> charge<00:01:50.570> and<00:01:51.979> then<00:01:52.979> just<00:01:53.340> under<00:01:53.700> an

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
start the charge and then just under an

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.760 
start the charge and then just under an
hour<00:01:53.970> here<00:01:54.420> you'll<00:01:54.750> have<00:01:54.990> all<00:01:55.170> six<00:01:55.500> of<00:01:55.619> these

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
hour here you'll have all six of these

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.509 
hour here you'll have all six of these
batteries<00:01:56.040> fully<00:01:56.460> balanced<00:01:57.030> charged
