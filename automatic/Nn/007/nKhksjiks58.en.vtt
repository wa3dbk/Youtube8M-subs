 you are going to see why I will not go up more 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.860
 videos today or yesterday is to 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.290
 you did not publish the video so 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:30.480
 Therefore, so that another 

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:32.009
 they were going bad youtube so we're going to 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.170
 it so that you have in the description 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.239
 of the previous video that has not seen it 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.610
 diet and this is impossible 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.100
 let's see I'm playing games of 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.670
 macho fuck and is that the responsos 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.379
 incredible there are games in which 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:48.420
 you enter and nothing else you enter the enemy 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:53.039
 it is already pointing you the most reborn or 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:54.899
 let's see let's see what we can 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.550
 do you have to practice a lot in this 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.920
 module 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:02.649
 to get a good game 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:04.780
 I was not there, but if I already 

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:06.610
 had gone is that he had a connection that 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:07.479
 the connection of this color is ominous 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:11.580
 judith 

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:13.590
 if you do not have 554,000 mb here 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.000
 it's not worth anything mother has killed me 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.220
 from the left 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.740
 the question is to get a good start 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.740
 to get first with this already with that 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:26.990

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:02.170
 mine the connection that I lose what 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:04.439
 what the connection shit is worth 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:04.439
 winning 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.310
