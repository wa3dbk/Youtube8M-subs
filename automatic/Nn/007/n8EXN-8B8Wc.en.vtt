so as of now you should be able to get a
break<00:01:39.690> snowblower<00:01:40.350> just<00:01:40.770> fine<00:01:41.039> I<00:01:43.340> don't<00:01:44.340> know

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.020 
break snowblower just fine I don't know

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.660 
break snowblower just fine I don't know
why<00:01:46.020> Briggs<00:01:46.350> &amp;<00:01:46.619> Stratton<00:01:46.649> would<00:01:47.189> put<00:01:47.399> too

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
why Briggs &amp; Stratton would put too

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.210 
why Briggs &amp; Stratton would put too
fricking<00:01:48.180> filler<00:01:48.420> ports<00:01:48.810> on<00:01:48.990> it<00:01:49.020> on<00:01:49.439> the<00:01:50.009> sides

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
fricking filler ports on it on the sides

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.059 
fricking filler ports on it on the sides
there<00:01:50.580> so<00:01:50.909> that<00:01:51.030> would<00:01:51.149> be<00:01:51.440> four<00:01:52.440> places<00:01:52.890> where

00:01:53.059 --> 00:01:53.069 
there so that would be four places where

00:01:53.069 --> 00:01:55.910 
there so that would be four places where
oil<00:01:53.100> could<00:01:53.520> leak<00:01:53.670> out<00:01:53.819> of<00:01:54.000> I<00:01:54.590> also<00:01:55.590> don't

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
oil could leak out of I also don't

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.719 
oil could leak out of I also don't
understand<00:01:56.700> why<00:01:57.619> that<00:01:58.619> the<00:01:59.250> guy<00:01:59.369> in<00:01:59.520> the<00:01:59.610> video

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
understand why that the guy in the video

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.550 
understand why that the guy in the video
I<00:01:59.909> don't<00:02:00.060> understand<00:02:00.690> why<00:02:00.869> he<00:02:01.080> wouldn't<00:02:01.289> check

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
I don't understand why he wouldn't check

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.300 
I don't understand why he wouldn't check
his<00:02:01.770> oil<00:02:01.890> every<00:02:02.250> time<00:02:02.429> he<00:02:02.549> uses<00:02:02.759> it<00:02:03.060> or<00:02:04.159> that<00:02:05.159> he

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
his oil every time he uses it or that he

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.309 
his oil every time he uses it or that he
wouldn't<00:02:05.549> notice<00:02:05.850> the<00:02:06.479> knocking<00:02:07.049> of<00:02:07.170> the

00:02:07.309 --> 00:02:07.319 
wouldn't notice the knocking of the

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:09.919 
wouldn't notice the knocking of the
engine<00:02:07.830> or<00:02:08.340> the<00:02:08.399> oil<00:02:08.759> spewing<00:02:09.420> out<00:02:09.630> of<00:02:09.810> there

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
engine or the oil spewing out of there

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:14.470 
engine or the oil spewing out of there
that's<00:02:10.170> that<00:02:10.830> just<00:02:11.069> seems<00:02:11.400> a<00:02:11.819> bit<00:02:11.850> odd<00:02:12.150> to<00:02:12.540> me

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
that's that just seems a bit odd to me

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:20.330 
that's that just seems a bit odd to me
so<00:02:16.280> it<00:02:17.280> gets<00:02:17.489> new<00:02:17.670> bulbs<00:02:18.030> through<00:02:18.209> that<00:02:18.360> but<00:02:19.340> so

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
so it gets new bulbs through that but so

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.720 
so it gets new bulbs through that but so
this<00:02:20.549> thing<00:02:21.590> having<00:02:22.590> a<00:02:22.769> problem<00:02:23.340> with<00:02:23.459> that<00:02:23.670> I

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
this thing having a problem with that I

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.930 
this thing having a problem with that I
got<00:02:23.940> at<00:02:24.030> some<00:02:24.180> wd-40<00:02:24.870> in<00:02:25.049> the<00:02:25.140> cable<00:02:25.820> see<00:02:26.820> it's

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
got at some wd-40 in the cable see it's

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.030

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
so far I'm pretty happy with this

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:47.210 
so far I'm pretty happy with this
machine<00:02:41.359> so<00:02:42.359> it's<00:02:42.540> really<00:02:42.840> strong<00:02:45.890> but<00:02:46.890> I<00:02:46.950> just

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
machine so it's really strong but I just

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.069 
machine so it's really strong but I just
wanted<00:02:47.489> to<00:02:47.579> show<00:02:47.730> you<00:02:47.790> that<00:02:48.090> with<00:02:48.390> those<00:02:48.690> will

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:49.079 
wanted to show you that with those will

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:51.650 
wanted to show you that with those will
report<00:02:49.470> to<00:02:49.500> go<00:02:49.739> on<00:02:49.799> out<00:02:50.010> of<00:02:50.040> there<00:02:50.250> I<00:02:50.660> was

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
report to go on out of there I was

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.780 
report to go on out of there I was
looking<00:02:51.989> at<00:02:52.109> it<00:02:52.290> when<00:02:53.100> I<00:02:53.160> first<00:02:53.340> got<00:02:53.549> the

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
looking at it when I first got the

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.150 
looking at it when I first got the
machine<00:02:54.060> to<00:02:54.410> but<00:02:55.410> I<00:02:55.440> was<00:02:55.620> wondering<00:02:55.859> what

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
machine to but I was wondering what

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.690 
machine to but I was wondering what
those<00:02:56.280> are<00:02:56.459> for

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
those are for

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.449 
those are for
and<00:02:57.350> I<00:02:58.350> figured<00:02:58.709> it<00:02:58.799> let's<00:02:58.980> just<00:02:59.190> be<00:02:59.340> where

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
and I figured it let's just be where

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:02.660 
and I figured it let's just be where
they<00:02:59.579> casted<00:03:00.060> the<00:03:00.180> engine<00:03:00.450> walk
