00:00:14.829 --> 00:00:17.339
 the singer during this week 

00:00:17.339 --> 00:00:18.599
 let's do 

00:00:18.599 --> 00:00:22.779
 an onion soup but as we need chicken broth let's make 

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:24.039
 the chicken broth 

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:27.980
 for that we need of course that minus three liters of water 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.719
 so in this case we have a carcass and some chicken parts like 

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:38.719
 a pair of wings and a piece of thigh 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:46.670
 a tomato 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:48.480
 one onion 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.480
 olive oil 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:58.180
 a couple of towns 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:01.130
 carrots 

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:02.350
 while 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:04.130
 turnip 

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:06.500
 one garlic clove 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.500
 a bay leaf 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:13.310
 a handful of rice 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:16.310
 salt to taste 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:22.020
 and even this is what we need to be punctual of simple 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.790
 of chicken 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.630
 they are many ingredients but you will see that it is simpler than it seems 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:31.640
 let's heat the water and while we're going to clean the chicken 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:35.300
 and the ingredients we put the chicken in the pot 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.220
 we throw the bundle 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:41.580
 laurel 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:43.980
 garlic clove 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:49.260
 the parsnip and the turnip the tomato remove the onion we remove the parts 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:50.790
 outside and we throw 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:56.450
 with the leek we take out the parts of the end we clean it and also inside 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:58.730
 the carrots are peeled 

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:01.810
 we cut them more or less planet if they are very long 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:04.370
 i inside the uia 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:06.370
 percent the rice 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:09.990
 the salt roughly to tablespoons per liter plus or minus 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.419
 and olive oil 

00:02:12.419 --> 00:02:14.549
 we remove a little 

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:17.459
 for how to give all the ingredients 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:18.700
 we want it to foam 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.830
 we take it out with a spoon and cover it 

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:25.689
 we treat it that the mind is not at all 

00:02:25.689 --> 00:02:30.599
 we also lower the temperature of the fire so you do not have fun the broth 

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:33.479
 bastard within two hours 

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:36.819
 If we want we can do it in an express pot 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:38.570
 with that what we will do will be 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:41.390
 Grant cut the cooking time 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:43.969
 to about 30 minutes 

00:02:43.969 --> 00:02:48.529
 and we counted 2 20 30 minutes approximately from when 

00:02:48.529 --> 00:02:50.129
 start to turn the valve 

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:53.489
 After two hours with the traditional pot all 30 minutes 

00:02:54.149 --> 00:02:56.909
 the aviles perez we have the broth 

00:02:56.909 --> 00:03:00.899
 eye that if we do it in the express pot we should wait between 10 and 15 minutes 

00:03:00.899 --> 00:03:03.589
 here the temperature drops and to be able to open 

00:03:03.589 --> 00:03:08.019
 quietly and without problems the the papa we are going to make the onion soup 

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:14.519
 we put in a pot a couple of tablespoons of oil and about 30 to 40 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:15.920
 grams of butter 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:17.249
 that they undo 

00:03:17.249 --> 00:03:20.569
 we take an onion we cut it into pieces and pilar chamos inside 

00:03:25.249 --> 00:03:26.899
 I think mons 

00:03:26.899 --> 00:03:30.189
 until the onion is a tad of life 

00:03:30.189 --> 00:03:32.739
 and we throw the broth 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:38.319
 that boil more or less for about 20 minutes noam a slow fire but a 

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:40.549
 little bit high but not quite 

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:43.689
 dry companc cut it into pieces 

00:03:43.689 --> 00:03:46.359
 and we put it in the pot 

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:49.359
 we remove a little 

00:03:50.999 --> 00:03:53.999
 and when and who is good looking 

00:03:55.259 --> 00:03:59.259
 we serve it in for example in a pair of catholic mud 

00:04:01.499 --> 00:04:05.399
 we put a little bit of ementhal cheese on top we were going to grill it in the oven 

00:04:05.399 --> 00:04:09.619
 or a microwave with grill but eye that only works live 

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:14.229
 5 10 minutes and we have the duck well 

00:04:14.229 --> 00:04:17.479
 Now with the rest of the broth, we'll take advantage of it 

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:19.579
 we will keep it 

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:24.759
 for that we take out the ingredients that we can eat, such as chicken 

00:04:24.759 --> 00:04:27.300
 or the carrot 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:30.300
 and the rest we throw 

00:04:31.809 --> 00:04:34.809
 with a strainer we put the broth in containers 

00:04:35.689 --> 00:04:38.689
 we wait more or less one night to cool 

00:04:47.249 --> 00:04:52.619
 and was benefited we can say to sarlo that is to say we can get out of the house 

00:04:52.619 --> 00:04:56.969
 that left the podium in a much easier way so we will have the broth of 

00:04:56.969 --> 00:04:57.490
 chicken 

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:00.490
 much healthier and with fewer calories
