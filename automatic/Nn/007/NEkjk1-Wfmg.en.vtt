00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.620
 green my throat like you have no idea 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:15.610
 this video that I can tell you both 

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:17.020
 ovaries with being this week and I think that 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:19.360
 will continue to happen because if not then 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:21.010
 nothing would happen that really because I 

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:22.930
 they made think about many things and it's because 

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:25.970
 that I come with this subject and the subject of 

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:27.800
 It is the following web 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:29.240
 have noticed that companies we 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.740
 they wash a lot of brain to play 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.880
 they want their products so it's us 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:34.430
 bomb when too much publicity 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:36.320
 in attention on the internet radio in 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:37.910
 everything so that we can acquire their 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.949
 products like for example the iphone 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:41.540
 says that the iphone is the most 

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:43.339
 expensive from everyone when their 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:44.960
 functions are very basic really is 

00:00:43.339 --> 00:00:47.089
 very silly subjects like with I think that 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:49.550
 cheaper solar cells that are better but 

00:00:47.089 --> 00:00:51.199
 truth in which not present 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:53.210
 well we do not have in you want 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:55.550
 to acquire it, we come to feel that 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:57.710
 thing is going to be unachievable as 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:59.780
 are the products supposedly good is 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:02.299
 what some think and that's why 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.979
 came out the iPhone 6 here in the USA have done 

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:06.590
 a lot of advertising the iphone 6 which is a 

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:09.110
 little thinner there are well different 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:11.509
 measures of the gigas that is bigger 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:13.189
 it's only an inch bigger and so 

00:01:11.509 --> 00:01:14.900
 I think that with that they already sold it to you but 

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:16.130
 that not only happens with a tree all the 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:18.979
 companies that launch products to the market 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:21.049
 they have to launch them with a certain type of 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:22.790
 marketing and that's why we get caught up 

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:23.869
 all because we are not funds for 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:27.159
 buy pendejadas 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:27.159
 no, it has 5 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:43.030
 but I do not have money to eat for 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:46.710
 get to the need to buy things 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:51.330
 that we prefer to buy food 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:53.250
 but you can buy a plane ticket 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:55.080
 to travel if I'm not wrong 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.090
 around $ 900 a little more 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:01.270
 but it's more the need to pretend what 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:02.799
 that we are not tired of not having friends 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:04.600
 but they say that he is poor and that he does not 

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:06.670
 you have to eat 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:09.280
 you are but you make videos for youtube and 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:13.720
 you have long hair and the others more 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:15.250
 scope because I present you with this 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.620
 phone you can pretend that you have 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:20.200
 money you have girlfriend you have friends 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:23.650
 that can be everything so call 01 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:26.980
 800 I want a friend there is 01 800 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:28.450
 I want a friend called a cabrona cinema and 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.580
 stupid of advertising in some 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:32.290
 really, I've seen information 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:33.970
 of mentions your videos that we 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:35.800
 present the things your points as if 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:38.140
 they went to great wonder of the world when 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:40.870
 they are not good they are like a linternite or 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:42.880
 a jeep that has served when 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:44.709
 you find that you already know they are lost and so 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:46.150
 it's a good device but it's not like the 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:48.459
 great wonder of the world would not be more 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:50.650
 easy to have them always at hand or in a 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:52.090
 hook in the pants I do not say it for 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:53.709
 advertising that can get attention 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:55.390
 from the posters to the commercial ones 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:56.650
 from the TV because I do not know there are colors 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:58.390
 specifically that they occupy in the 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:00.130
 commercials are the posters to call 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:03.130
 your attention for example the color of 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:07.660
 yellow and red mcdonal's you can 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:09.940
 really according to place a garment 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:11.800
 but supposedly the color red and the 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:13.780
 yellow they just make you hungry 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:16.060
 to brad the hunger that's why they put it 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:18.010
 in mcdonald's the blue color you know because 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:21.130
 the social networks are blue and 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:23.610
 be facebook and twitter now I do not know what 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:23.610
 other bases 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:33.420
 relax keep calm with the 

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:35.040
 heart keeps you calm so that's why 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:37.440
 that putting them is followed by other 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:39.240
 things all the color what you call the 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:41.040
 attention is why they sell you the 

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:42.720
 things and to enter something that is not going 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:45.300
 material things the worst that can be 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:48.780
 this life I think that if you do it 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:52.680
 it's because you want to hide something in the 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:54.180
 men after is something tiny and the 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:56.280
 women are the attention lists 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:57.980
 and then do these to call more the 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:00.300
 attention as if they do not have enough 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:01.770
 Whoever has the sack 

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:02.970
 following you know you do not accomplish things that 

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:04.470
 you think they're going to make you popular 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:06.810
 the popular processes and continue in the 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:09.390
 case you want to feel it happens to me 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:11.250
 things so at least they are 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:15.990
 things you buy with your own effort 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:18.590
 neither have they been that the donkey 

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:18.590
 talking about ears 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:25.200
 they are in their right to do it think 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:27.270
 a little think about how much you think about 

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:28.980
 I'm really going to be almost a thousand dollars in 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:31.470
 a cell phone with these thousand 

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:33.450
 dollars can be a lot believe me you're not going 

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:34.800
 to pass the latest telephone news 

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:38.520

 one day it will arrive so you already know 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:45.210
 I hope you like and do not know 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:47.340
 leave them buying things that are 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:49.680
 very expensive and what new can pay and goes
