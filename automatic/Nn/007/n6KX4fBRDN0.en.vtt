and those braces attempt to sustain but

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.170 
and those braces attempt to sustain but
today<00:01:53.530> and<00:01:53.710> we're<00:01:53.890> using<00:01:54.130> braces<00:01:54.610> that<00:01:55.000> are

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:55.180 
today and we're using braces that are

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:57.810 
today and we're using braces that are
made<00:01:55.390> of<00:01:55.540> ceramic<00:01:56.170> and<00:01:56.350> ceramic<00:01:56.890> themselves

will<00:01:58.060> not<00:01:58.270> take<00:01:58.570> on<00:01:58.750> any<00:01:58.780> steam<00:01:59.350> and<00:01:59.680> also<00:02:00.340> we

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:00.580 
will not take on any steam and also we

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:04.230 
will not take on any steam and also we
now<00:02:01.270> use<00:02:01.300> metal<00:02:02.290> clip<00:02:02.710> that<00:02:03.250> holds<00:02:03.490> the<00:02:03.729> wiring

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:04.240 
now use metal clip that holds the wiring

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:06.900 
now use metal clip that holds the wiring
and<00:02:04.510> those<00:02:05.140> metal<00:02:05.530> Clips<00:02:05.830> will<00:02:06.070> not<00:02:06.280> stain<00:02:06.700> as

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:06.910 
and those metal Clips will not stain as

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:10.710
