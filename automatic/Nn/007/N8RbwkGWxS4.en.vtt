00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:42.700 

watch<00:02:41.330> very<00:02:41.570> slow<00:02:41.840> slowly<00:02:42.380> I'm<00:02:42.530> going<00:02:42.650> to

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:42.710 
watch very slow slowly I'm going to

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:44.980 
watch very slow slowly I'm going to
break<00:02:42.860> it<00:02:43.010> down<00:02:43.040> play<00:02:43.430> it<00:02:43.490> slow<00:02:43.940> so<00:02:44.810> you<00:02:44.840> can

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:44.990 
break it down play it slow so you can

00:02:44.990 --> 00:03:07.260 
break it down play it slow so you can
get<00:02:45.230> the<00:02:45.320> strumming<00:02:45.620> pattern

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:07.270 

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:24.760 

the<00:03:08.080> next<00:03:08.410> part<00:03:08.680> is<00:03:09.540> everything

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:24.770 

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:26.980 

all<00:03:25.460> right<00:03:25.670> so<00:03:26.300> that's<00:03:26.420> we'll<00:03:26.660> call<00:03:26.810> that<00:03:26.900> the

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:26.990 
all right so that's we'll call that the

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:31.070 
all right so that's we'll call that the
pre-chorus<00:03:27.410> okay<00:03:28.280> so<00:03:28.340> it's<00:03:28.760> every<00:03:29.540> time

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:31.080 
pre-chorus okay so it's every time

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:34.920 
pre-chorus okay so it's every time
they<00:03:31.590> were<00:03:31.860> sure<00:03:32.160> that<00:03:32.190> you

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:34.930 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:40.830 

so<00:03:35.930> that's<00:03:36.230> fgc<00:03:37.099> I'm<00:03:37.370> on<00:03:37.610> see<00:03:37.790> right<00:03:37.970> now<00:03:38.090> an<00:03:38.840> e7

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 
so that's fgc I'm on see right now an e7
