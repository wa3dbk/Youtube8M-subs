 the attackers were killed by armed guards 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.100
 before you managed to hurt any of 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.320
 meeting participants by message 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.750
 the organizers spent about 10,000 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.550
 dollars for security 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:49.320
 after the incident, the exhibition coordinator 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.620
 pamela gellar called the attacks 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.730
 manifestations of war against freedom of speech 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:55.920
 obviously she intends to get revenge 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:59.280
 having organized a new ad campaign in 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.449
 washington however the authorities imposed 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.760
 temporary ban on accommodation 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.890
 images of the prophet mohammed on 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.380
 urban transport arguing this 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.750
 so that then trains and buses can 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.549
 be targeted by terrorists in response gellar 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.770
 stated that the media and policy introduces 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.520
 censorship thus promoting laws 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.860
 sharia 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.990
 we discussed the advertising campaign pamela 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.280
 gellar with american experts 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.259
 Islamic relations 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.820
 they agreed that the activist 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:29.790
 builds a career on the spread 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:32.250
 intolerance letters in words for little 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.470
 gellar sound only hate and bigotry 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.210
 she is famous for it and now drives by 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.020
 cities spreading aggression 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.030
 intolerance 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:45.600
 so there is nothing in this situation 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:47.939
 new pamela gellar does it not 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.280
 first time she came to washington 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:51.840
 with these posters it is quite clear what 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.000
 can lead her action 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.640
 because gellar promotes forest and water word 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.610
 rhetoric of hate and and posters express 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.049
 aggression against muslims usa 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:03.299
 aim to insult them 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:05.399
 most of the population do not agree 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:07.079
 with her behavior in reality it 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:09.149
 not representative of that part 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:12.020
 population of the country which in its opinion 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.020
 presents
