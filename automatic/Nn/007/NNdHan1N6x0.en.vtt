this<00:00:45.329> is<00:00:45.510> the<00:00:45.600> case<00:00:45.780> you<00:00:45.930> tag<00:00:46.110> here<00:00:46.379> is<00:00:47.039> an

lemon shots and that means that anyone

lemon shots and that means that anyone
who<00:00:53.850> catches<00:00:54.059> the<00:00:54.300> shark<00:00:54.660> or<00:00:54.899> encounters<00:00:55.469> the

who catches the shark or encounters the
shot<00:00:55.890> and<00:00:56.399> see<00:00:56.640> that<00:00:56.789> it's<00:00:56.910> been<00:00:57.059> tagged<00:00:57.360> and

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
shot and see that it's been tagged and

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:58.939 
shot and see that it's been tagged and
if<00:00:57.660> they<00:00:57.809> have<00:00:57.930> any<00:00:58.079> knowledge<00:00:58.320> about<00:00:58.530> shark

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
if they have any knowledge about shark

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.939 
if they have any knowledge about shark
tagging<00:00:59.340> they<00:00:59.460> can<00:00:59.640> return<00:00:59.910> this<00:01:00.059> information

00:01:00.939 --> 00:01:00.949 
tagging they can return this information

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:04.039 
tagging they can return this information
so<00:01:01.949> when<00:01:02.460> we<00:01:02.579> catch<00:01:02.850> the<00:01:03.000> shock<00:01:03.239> on<00:01:03.539> the<00:01:03.930> long

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
so when we catch the shock on the long

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.350 
so when we catch the shock on the long
lines<00:01:04.290> will<00:01:04.530> have<00:01:04.710> it<00:01:04.860> tied<00:01:05.489> up<00:01:05.670> alongside<00:01:05.939> the

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
lines will have it tied up alongside the

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.679 
lines will have it tied up alongside the
boat<00:01:07.610> with<00:01:08.610> a<00:01:08.640> towel<00:01:08.939> rack<00:01:09.180> to<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:09.420> rear<00:01:09.630> and

boat with a towel rack to the rear and

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.270 
boat with a towel rack to the rear and
we'll<00:01:09.900> leave<00:01:10.020> the<00:01:10.170> hook<00:01:10.290> and<00:01:10.439> use<00:01:10.799> that<00:01:10.830> to<00:01:11.010> the

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
we'll leave the hook and use that to the

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.679 
we'll leave the hook and use that to the
front<00:01:11.520> and<00:01:11.670> we'll<00:01:11.790> stretch<00:01:12.030> alongside<00:01:12.390> the

front and we'll stretch alongside the
bait<00:01:12.869> so<00:01:13.110> it's<00:01:13.320> heads<00:01:13.530> into<00:01:13.830> the<00:01:13.920> current<00:01:14.159> I

can<00:01:14.490> breathe<00:01:14.640> nicely<00:01:15.150> and<00:01:15.750> then<00:01:16.080> we'll<00:01:16.259> apply

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
can breathe nicely and then we'll apply

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.100

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590

degree<00:01:28.860> angle<00:01:29.189> we<00:01:30.180> hold<00:01:30.360> that<00:01:30.479> with<00:01:30.689> one<00:01:30.810> hand

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
degree angle we hold that with one hand

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.719 
degree angle we hold that with one hand
there<00:01:31.259> and<00:01:31.500> give<00:01:31.650> it<00:01:31.680> a<00:01:31.770> big<00:01:31.950> whack<00:01:32.400> with<00:01:32.640> the

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
there and give it a big whack with the

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.609 
there and give it a big whack with the
other<00:01:32.820> hand<00:01:33.119> and<00:01:33.570> that<00:01:33.720> pushes<00:01:33.930> the<00:01:34.229> dart<00:01:34.439> in

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
other hand and that pushes the dart in

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.380 
other hand and that pushes the dart in
and<00:01:34.890> then<00:01:35.040> we<00:01:35.159> pull<00:01:35.369> out<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:35.670> applicator<00:01:36.119> and

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
and then we pull out the applicator and

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.679 
and then we pull out the applicator and
the<00:01:36.990> rubber<00:01:37.170> band<00:01:37.850> leaves<00:01:38.850> it<00:01:39.030> in<00:01:39.090> there<00:01:39.329> like

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
the rubber band leaves it in there like

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.050 
the rubber band leaves it in there like
so<00:01:39.990> and<00:01:40.259> then<00:01:40.890> this<00:01:41.070> trails<00:01:41.400> off<00:01:41.610> behind<00:01:41.820> the

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
so and then this trails off behind the

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.370 
so and then this trails off behind the
shock<00:01:42.240> it<00:01:42.420> doesn't<00:01:42.689> really<00:01:42.780> hurt<00:01:42.899> the<00:01:43.170> shots

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
shock it doesn't really hurt the shots

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.139 
shock it doesn't really hurt the shots
of<00:01:43.560> sharks<00:01:43.829> barely<00:01:44.189> ever<00:01:44.280> even<00:01:44.520> reacting<00:01:45.030> when

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
of sharks barely ever even reacting when

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:46.280 
of sharks barely ever even reacting when
they<00:01:45.240> do<00:01:45.299> I<00:01:45.390> think<00:01:45.659> it's<00:01:45.810> more<00:01:45.869> to<00:01:46.200> the

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
they do I think it's more to the

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:47.749 
they do I think it's more to the
pressure<00:01:46.560> an<00:01:46.770> actual<00:01:47.130> pain<00:01:47.340> of<00:01:47.490> the<00:01:47.579> shaft

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
pressure an actual pain of the shaft

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.450 
pressure an actual pain of the shaft
going<00:01:48.500> so<00:01:49.500> this<00:01:49.680> drills<00:01:49.950> back<00:01:50.130> like<00:01:50.280> this<00:01:50.399> and

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
going so this drills back like this and

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.639 
going so this drills back like this and
this<00:01:50.670> how<00:01:50.850> it<00:01:51.000> has<00:01:51.180> a<00:01:51.210> six<00:01:51.600> digit<00:01:51.780> you<00:01:52.380> can<00:01:52.500> see

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
this how it has a six digit you can see

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.249

catching them and letting them go and

00:02:46.139 --> 00:02:49.789 
catching them and letting them go and
they<00:02:46.530> can<00:02:46.739> be<00:02:46.769> setting<00:02:47.250> these<00:02:47.340> tags<00:02:47.669> to<00:02:48.680> put<00:02:49.680> in

00:02:49.789 --> 00:02:49.799 
they can be setting these tags to put in

they can be setting these tags to put in
the<00:02:49.889> Sharks<00:02:50.250> which<00:02:50.430> gives<00:02:50.639> a<00:02:50.730> more<00:02:50.879> motivation

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
the Sharks which gives a more motivation

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:52.849 
the Sharks which gives a more motivation
i<00:02:51.569> guess<00:02:51.750> to<00:02:51.870> keep<00:02:52.019> the<00:02:52.139> shot<00:02:52.349> survived<00:02:52.680> it

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:52.859 
i guess to keep the shot survived it

00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:53.809 
i guess to keep the shot survived it
makes<00:02:53.069> them<00:02:53.189> feel<00:02:53.250> like<00:02:53.519> they're<00:02:53.669> doing

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:53.819 
makes them feel like they're doing

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:57.619 
makes them feel like they're doing
something<00:02:55.489> so<00:02:56.489> when<00:02:56.700> someone<00:02:56.939> catches<00:02:57.389> this<00:02:57.569> a

00:02:57.619 --> 00:02:57.629 
something so when someone catches this a

00:02:57.629 --> 00:03:00.289 
something so when someone catches this a
shark<00:02:58.500> if<00:02:58.739> it<00:02:58.950> has<00:02:59.099> one<00:02:59.129> of<00:02:59.370> these<00:02:59.430> tags<00:02:59.730> on<00:02:59.909> and

00:03:00.289 --> 00:03:00.299 
shark if it has one of these tags on and

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:01.640 
shark if it has one of these tags on and
they<00:03:00.450> see<00:03:00.689> when<00:03:00.840> you<00:03:00.959> see<00:03:01.109> it's<00:03:01.230> got<00:03:01.319> a<00:03:01.379> screw

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
they see when you see it's got a screw

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:04.580 
they see when you see it's got a screw
tip<00:03:01.829> on<00:03:02.040> the<00:03:02.069> top<00:03:02.340> there<00:03:02.549> this<00:03:03.389> comes<00:03:03.750> off<00:03:03.900> this

were<00:04:46.210> thinning<00:04:46.509> is<00:04:46.870> legal<00:04:47.289> so<00:04:47.470> it's<00:04:47.889> very<00:04:48.009> very

00:04:48.149 --> 00:04:48.159 
were thinning is legal so it's very very

00:04:48.159 --> 00:04:51.540 
were thinning is legal so it's very very

that's<00:05:03.310> only<00:05:03.490> so<00:05:03.789> far<00:05:04.030> so<00:05:04.210> I'm<00:05:04.300> sort<00:05:04.539> of<00:05:04.599> be

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:04.750 
that's only so far so I'm sort of be

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:07.289 
that's only so far so I'm sort of be
