minutes<00:05:34.250> probably<00:05:34.520> and<00:05:35.389> then<00:05:35.570> we'll<00:05:35.690> take

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:35.810 
minutes probably and then we'll take

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:37.420 
minutes probably and then we'll take
them<00:05:35.930> out<00:05:36.080> and<00:05:36.260> then<00:05:36.530> we'll<00:05:36.710> put<00:05:36.860> them<00:05:37.010> in<00:05:37.160> that

way the bottom of the brownies is a

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:40.089 
way the bottom of the brownies is a
little<00:05:39.110> bit<00:05:39.229> harder<00:05:39.500> and<00:05:39.590> the<00:05:39.680> edges<00:05:40.010> a<00:05:40.039> little

00:05:40.089 --> 00:05:40.099 
little bit harder and the edges a little

little bit harder and the edges a little
bit<00:05:40.280> harder<00:05:40.669> and<00:05:40.849> that<00:05:41.330> makes<00:05:41.539> it<00:05:41.690> a<00:05:41.780> lot

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:41.900 
bit harder and that makes it a lot

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:43.810 
bit harder and that makes it a lot
better<00:05:42.080> and<00:05:42.470> the<00:05:42.500> Reese's<00:05:43.190> don't<00:05:43.400> melt<00:05:43.610> as

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:43.820 
better and the Reese's don't melt as
