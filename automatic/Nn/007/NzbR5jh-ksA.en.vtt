00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
your higher playing and the hi-hat is

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.189 
your higher playing and the hi-hat is
important<00:00:56.760> it's<00:00:56.910> actually<00:00:57.329> very<00:00:57.629> important

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
important it's actually very important

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.979 
important it's actually very important
especially<00:00:58.949> when<00:00:59.370> you're<00:00:59.489> into<00:00:59.850> into<00:01:00.660> groove

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
especially when you're into into groove

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.899 
especially when you're into into groove
right<00:01:03.049> so<00:01:04.049> here's<00:01:04.559> the<00:01:04.650> thing<00:01:05.100> we're<00:01:05.640> going<00:01:05.760> to

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
right so here's the thing we're going to

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:11.179 
right so here's the thing we're going to
try<00:01:06.210> a<00:01:06.240> little<00:01:06.479> exercise<00:01:07.140> you<00:01:09.110> probably<00:01:10.189> know

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
try a little exercise you probably know

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.280 
try a little exercise you probably know
already<00:01:11.490> about<00:01:11.820> the<00:01:12.240> difference<00:01:12.600> between<00:01:12.869> the

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
already about the difference between the

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.530 
already about the difference between the
edge<00:01:13.470> sound<00:01:13.890> and<00:01:14.130> the<00:01:14.250> tip<00:01:14.460> sound<00:01:14.790> right

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
edge sound and the tip sound right

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.289 
edge sound and the tip sound right
so<00:01:16.140> what<00:01:16.350> drummers<00:01:16.740> do<00:01:16.920> quite<00:01:17.460> often<00:01:17.729> is<00:01:18.030> they

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
so what drummers do quite often is they

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:23.539 
so what drummers do quite often is they
mix<00:01:18.600> both<00:01:21.409> for<00:01:22.409> example<00:01:22.830> like<00:01:22.950> the<00:01:23.100> most

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
mix both for example like the most

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.170 
mix both for example like the most
prominent<00:01:24.240> one<00:01:24.540> probably<00:01:25.759> playing<00:01:26.759> on<00:01:27.000> the

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
prominent one probably playing on the

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.660 
prominent one probably playing on the
edge<00:01:27.390> on<00:01:27.750> the<00:01:28.080> downbeats<00:01:28.680> like<00:01:28.950> on<00:01:29.100> the<00:01:29.460> beat

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
edge on the downbeats like on the beat

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.440 
edge on the downbeats like on the beat
and<00:01:31.400> using<00:01:32.400> the<00:01:32.549> tip<00:01:32.729> of<00:01:32.850> the<00:01:33.000> stick<00:01:33.150> on<00:01:33.299> the

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
and using the tip of the stick on the

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.420 
and using the tip of the stick on the
surface<00:01:33.869> for<00:01:34.170> the<00:01:34.380> offbeat's

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
surface for the offbeat's

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.999 
surface for the offbeat's
that<00:01:36.180> means<00:01:36.479> you're<00:01:36.689> going<00:01:36.840> to<00:01:36.930> get<00:01:37.049> movement

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
that means you're going to get movement

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:48.530 
that means you're going to get movement
like<00:01:38.100> this<00:01:46.369> right<00:01:47.369> so<00:01:47.610> it's<00:01:47.729> up<00:01:47.970> and<00:01:48.240> down

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
like this right so it's up and down

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.569 
like this right so it's up and down
motion<00:01:48.780> a<00:01:49.049> bit<00:01:49.590> of<00:01:49.710> Mullah<00:01:49.950> technique<00:01:50.399> in

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
motion a bit of Mullah technique in

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.630 
motion a bit of Mullah technique in
there<00:01:50.759> for<00:01:50.970> sure<00:01:51.290> so<00:01:52.290> that<00:01:52.710> means<00:01:53.280> on<00:01:53.490> the

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
there for sure so that means on the

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.480 
there for sure so that means on the
downbeats<00:01:54.030> when<00:01:54.210> you<00:01:54.299> hit<00:01:54.450> the<00:01:54.630> edge<00:01:55.280> of<00:01:56.280> the

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
downbeats when you hit the edge of the

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.539 
downbeats when you hit the edge of the
hi-hat<00:01:57.170> this<00:01:58.170> is<00:01:58.350> going<00:01:58.560> to<00:01:58.680> line<00:01:58.890> up<00:01:59.100> with<00:01:59.130> the

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
hi-hat this is going to line up with the

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.539 
hi-hat this is going to line up with the
bass<00:01:59.880> drum<00:01:59.909> and<00:02:00.540> the<00:02:00.689> snare<00:02:00.719> drums<00:02:01.310> if<00:02:02.310> you

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
bass drum and the snare drums if you

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:05.690 
bass drum and the snare drums if you
play<00:02:02.960> just<00:02:03.960> a<00:02:04.049> basic<00:02:04.500> rock<00:02:04.979> beat<00:02:05.009> right<00:02:05.460> like<00:02:05.670> a

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
play just a basic rock beat right like a

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.719 
play just a basic rock beat right like a
bass<00:02:06.630> drum<00:02:06.659> on<00:02:06.930> one<00:02:07.290> and<00:02:07.469> three<00:02:07.619> snare<00:02:08.429> drum<00:02:08.610> on

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
bass drum on one and three snare drum on

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.940 
bass drum on one and three snare drum on
two<00:02:08.789> and<00:02:09.030> four<00:02:09.179> kind<00:02:09.929> of<00:02:10.050> thing<00:02:10.229> so<00:02:10.679> it's<00:02:10.800> going

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
two and four kind of thing so it's going

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:25.920 
two and four kind of thing so it's going
to<00:02:11.039> sound<00:02:11.190> like<00:02:11.310> this

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.950 

so<00:02:26.930> try<00:02:27.200> that<00:02:27.410> first<00:02:27.680> and<00:02:27.950> then<00:02:28.070> try<00:02:29.000> all<00:02:29.330> the

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:29.960 
so try that first and then try all the

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:32.350 
so try that first and then try all the
other<00:02:30.080> groups<00:02:30.470> you<00:02:30.740> can<00:02:30.920> play<00:02:31.190> right<00:02:31.490> try<00:02:32.300> to

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360 
other groups you can play right try to

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.180 
other groups you can play right try to
get<00:02:32.600> more<00:02:32.810> independent<00:02:33.410> with<00:02:33.560> your<00:02:33.740> bass<00:02:33.890> drum

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
get more independent with your bass drum

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:39.070 
get more independent with your bass drum
and<00:02:34.370> snare<00:02:34.730> drum<00:02:35.000> while<00:02:36.070> playing<00:02:37.070> this<00:02:38.080> hi-hat

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:39.080 
and snare drum while playing this hi-hat

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:59.170 
and snare drum while playing this hi-hat
pattern<00:02:39.470> right<00:02:39.650> so<00:02:40.220> a<00:02:40.250> bit<00:02:40.430> like<00:02:40.580> this<00:02:58.180> right

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
pattern right so a bit like this right

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.360 
pattern right so a bit like this right
you<00:02:59.390> get<00:02:59.750> the<00:02:59.900> idea<00:03:00.140> it<00:03:00.380> might<00:03:00.770> takes<00:03:01.070> a<00:03:01.190> while

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
you get the idea it might takes a while

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:03.610 
you get the idea it might takes a while
you've<00:03:01.640> never<00:03:01.850> done<00:03:02.060> that<00:03:02.140> take<00:03:03.140> it<00:03:03.260> slow<00:03:03.470> and

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620 
you've never done that take it slow and

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.100 
you've never done that take it slow and
easier<00:03:03.920> it's<00:03:04.790> going<00:03:04.970> to<00:03:05.030> take<00:03:05.300> some<00:03:05.600> time<00:03:05.840> to

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:06.110 
easier it's going to take some time to

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:10.660 
easier it's going to take some time to
build<00:03:06.290> that<00:03:06.670> independence<00:03:07.670> up<00:03:07.850> right<00:03:08.350> so<00:03:09.670> now

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:10.670 
build that independence up right so now

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:12.580 
build that independence up right so now
let's<00:03:10.700> turn<00:03:11.150> the<00:03:11.300> pattern<00:03:11.480> around<00:03:11.780> it's<00:03:12.290> a

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:12.590 
let's turn the pattern around it's a

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:15.910 
let's turn the pattern around it's a
little<00:03:12.890> bit<00:03:12.980> harder<00:03:13.550> to<00:03:13.700> play<00:03:14.770> but<00:03:15.770> also

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:15.920 
little bit harder to play but also

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:19.270 
little bit harder to play but also
extremely<00:03:16.640> groovy<00:03:17.270> and<00:03:17.390> very<00:03:17.630> important<00:03:18.280> that

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:19.280 
extremely groovy and very important that

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:20.830 
extremely groovy and very important that
means<00:03:19.460> we're<00:03:19.700> going<00:03:19.850> to<00:03:19.910> use<00:03:20.120> exactly<00:03:20.360> the

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:20.840 
means we're going to use exactly the

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:24.250 
means we're going to use exactly the
same<00:03:20.870> motion<00:03:21.410> on<00:03:21.530> the<00:03:21.680> hi-hat<00:03:22.330> but<00:03:23.330> we're

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:24.260 
same motion on the hi-hat but we're

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.280 
same motion on the hi-hat but we're
going<00:03:24.440> to<00:03:24.530> start<00:03:24.830> with<00:03:25.100> the<00:03:25.460> with<00:03:26.060> the<00:03:26.330> tip<00:03:26.990> on

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:27.290 
going to start with the with the tip on

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:31.150 
going to start with the with the tip on
the<00:03:28.190> surface<00:03:28.670> on<00:03:28.880> the<00:03:29.240> beats<00:03:29.600> right<00:03:30.080> so<00:03:31.010> you're

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:31.160 
the surface on the beats right so you're

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.100 
the surface on the beats right so you're
going<00:03:31.370> to<00:03:31.430> play<00:03:31.820> on<00:03:32.000> all<00:03:32.210> the<00:03:32.360> beats<00:03:32.600> like<00:03:32.960> on

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:33.110 
going to play on all the beats like on

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:34.450 
going to play on all the beats like on
one<00:03:33.260> two<00:03:33.440> three<00:03:33.740> four<00:03:33.980> you're<00:03:34.100> going<00:03:34.160> to<00:03:34.310> play

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:39.830 
going to play on the edge so it's like

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:45.610 
going to play on the edge so it's like

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:02.360 
from then on do the same thing add a

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:05.380 
from then on do the same thing add a

things<00:04:05.690> around<00:04:05.870> it's<00:04:06.440> all<00:04:06.680> about

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:06.920 
things around it's all about

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:10.380 
things around it's all about

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:13.520 
rhythms against that hired pattern right

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:30.650 
rhythms against that hired pattern right
something<00:04:14.360> like<00:04:14.390> this

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:30.660 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:34.800 

all<00:04:31.660> right<00:04:31.870> you<00:04:32.020> get<00:04:32.350> the<00:04:32.410> idea<00:04:32.910> a<00:04:33.910> same<00:04:34.780> thing

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:34.810 
all right you get the idea a same thing

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:37.560 
all right you get the idea a same thing
if<00:04:35.110> you've<00:04:35.230> never<00:04:35.440> tried<00:04:35.680> that<00:04:35.950> before<00:04:36.570> start

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:37.570 
if you've never tried that before start

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:41.180 
if you've never tried that before start
slow<00:04:37.870> work<00:04:38.740> on<00:04:38.980> every<00:04:39.670> rhythm<00:04:39.910> separately<00:04:40.600> and

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:41.190 
slow work on every rhythm separately and

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:43.470 
slow work on every rhythm separately and
it's<00:04:42.190> going<00:04:42.400> to<00:04:42.490> get<00:04:42.550> better<00:04:42.790> soon<00:04:43.030> if<00:04:43.210> you<00:04:43.300> put

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:43.480 
it's going to get better soon if you put

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:46.290 
it's going to get better soon if you put
some<00:04:43.690> time<00:04:44.230> in<00:04:44.440> there<00:04:44.620> right<00:04:44.800> now<00:04:45.400> you<00:04:45.820> can<00:04:46.180> do

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:46.300 
some time in there right now you can do

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:48.570 
some time in there right now you can do
exactly<00:04:46.630> the<00:04:47.050> same<00:04:47.110> of<00:04:47.470> sixteenth<00:04:47.950> notes<00:04:48.250> as

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:48.580 
exactly the same of sixteenth notes as

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:51.240 
exactly the same of sixteenth notes as
well<00:04:48.910> like<00:04:49.210> sixteenth<00:04:49.960> note<00:04:50.170> based<00:04:50.500> higher

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:51.250 
well like sixteenth note based higher

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:54.090 
well like sixteenth note based higher
patterns<00:04:52.020> let's<00:04:53.020> say<00:04:53.170> you<00:04:53.230> have<00:04:53.500> a<00:04:53.530> group<00:04:53.830> like

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:54.100 
patterns let's say you have a group like

00:04:54.100 --> 00:05:01.200 
patterns let's say you have a group like
this<00:04:58.260> right<00:04:59.260> you<00:04:59.440> can<00:04:59.730> you<00:05:00.730> can<00:05:00.910> treat<00:05:01.180> it

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:01.210 
this right you can you can treat it

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:12.780 
this right you can you can treat it
exactly<00:05:01.720> the<00:05:01.870> same<00:05:02.050> way<00:05:10.920> if<00:05:11.920> you<00:05:11.980> go<00:05:12.190> fast<00:05:12.550> on

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:12.790 
exactly the same way if you go fast on

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:15.150 
exactly the same way if you go fast on
the<00:05:12.970> Hyatt<00:05:13.180> your<00:05:13.450> entire<00:05:14.260> right<00:05:14.950> hand

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:15.160 
the Hyatt your entire right hand

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:16.440 
the Hyatt your entire right hand
movement<00:05:15.580> is<00:05:15.670> going<00:05:15.820> to<00:05:15.910> narrow<00:05:16.150> down<00:05:16.390> a

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:16.450 
movement is going to narrow down a

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:20.460 
movement is going to narrow down a
little<00:05:16.780> bit<00:05:18.180> that's<00:05:19.180> just<00:05:19.390> natural<00:05:19.810> right<00:05:20.350> and

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:20.470 
little bit that's just natural right and

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:22.590 
little bit that's just natural right and
then<00:05:21.040> same<00:05:21.430> thing<00:05:21.460> with<00:05:21.820> the<00:05:22.000> offbeat's

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:22.600 
then same thing with the offbeat's

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:36.690 
then same thing with the offbeat's
like<00:05:23.050> if<00:05:23.200> you<00:05:23.320> play<00:05:34.710> so<00:05:35.710> playing<00:05:36.220> the<00:05:36.280> off

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:36.700 
like if you play so playing the off

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:39.630 
like if you play so playing the off
beats<00:05:37.000> on<00:05:37.290> sixteenth<00:05:38.290> note<00:05:38.440> based<00:05:38.710> high<00:05:39.040> hats

beats on sixteenth note based high hats

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:42.000 
beats on sixteenth note based high hats
high<00:05:40.210> hat<00:05:40.360> patterns<00:05:40.780> is<00:05:41.530> a<00:05:41.560> little<00:05:41.890> bit

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:42.010 
high hat patterns is a little bit

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:44.130 
high hat patterns is a little bit
trickier<00:05:42.580> but<00:05:43.390> you're<00:05:43.600> going<00:05:43.780> to<00:05:43.870> figure<00:05:44.080> it

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:44.140 
trickier but you're going to figure it

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:45.900 
trickier but you're going to figure it
out<00:05:44.230> right<00:05:44.560> it's<00:05:44.740> all<00:05:44.920> about<00:05:44.950> the<00:05:45.430> time<00:05:45.730> you

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:45.910 
out right it's all about the time you

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:49.440 
out right it's all about the time you
put<00:05:46.120> in<00:05:46.240> sit<00:05:46.840> down<00:05:47.050> work<00:05:47.710> on<00:05:47.830> one<00:05:48.150> group<00:05:49.150> at<00:05:49.420> a

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:49.450 
put in sit down work on one group at a
