00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.090 
it's like most type of cycles where you
go<00:01:57.299> to<00:01:57.360> the<00:01:57.600> right<00:01:57.810> it's<00:01:58.350> ordering<00:01:58.799> you<00:01:58.920> go<00:01:59.039> to

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
go to the right it's ordering you go to

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.039 
go to the right it's ordering you go to
the<00:01:59.310> left<00:01:59.490> that's<00:01:59.729> easier<00:02:00.149> so<00:02:00.720> what<00:02:00.869> I<00:02:00.899> usually

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
the left that's easier so what I usually

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:04.160 
the left that's easier so what I usually
do<00:02:01.409> when<00:02:01.560> I'm<00:02:01.709> just<00:02:01.890> setting<00:02:02.429> up<00:02:02.580> the<00:02:03.240> cycle<00:02:03.720> is

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
do when I'm just setting up the cycle is

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.660 
do when I'm just setting up the cycle is
just<00:02:04.409> taking<00:02:04.709> on<00:02:04.799> the<00:02:04.860> right<00:02:04.979> hand<00:02:05.250> my<00:02:05.399> strong

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
just taking on the right hand my strong

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.969 
just taking on the right hand my strong
hand<00:02:05.909> kind<00:02:06.840> of<00:02:06.899> give<00:02:07.080> it<00:02:07.170> to<00:02:07.319> where<00:02:07.470> up<00:02:07.530> to<00:02:07.740> like

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
hand kind of give it to where up to like

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.770 
hand kind of give it to where up to like
is<00:02:08.160> really<00:02:08.399> good<00:02:08.970> enough<00:02:09.149> attention<00:02:09.660> that

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
is really good enough attention that

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.270 
is really good enough attention that
we're<00:02:09.899> trying<00:02:10.080> to<00:02:10.170> do<00:02:10.380> some<00:02:10.560> single<00:02:10.950> one<00:02:11.069> more

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
we're trying to do some single one more

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.100 
we're trying to do some single one more
time<00:02:11.459> to<00:02:11.580> accomplish<00:02:11.849> it<00:02:12.269> to<00:02:12.750> get<00:02:12.900> when<00:02:13.049> I

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
time to accomplish it to get when I

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:14.720 
time to accomplish it to get when I
bring<00:02:13.140> into<00:02:13.500> both<00:02:13.769> home<00:02:13.980> it's<00:02:14.250> just<00:02:14.280> a<00:02:14.489> little

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
bring into both home it's just a little

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.930 
bring into both home it's just a little
bit<00:02:14.819> easier<00:02:15.180> to<00:02:15.299> do<00:02:16.099> when<00:02:17.099> I'm<00:02:17.220> looking<00:02:17.610> to<00:02:17.730> go

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
bit easier to do when I'm looking to go

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.199 
bit easier to do when I'm looking to go
to<00:02:18.480> the<00:02:18.660> forward<00:02:19.500> position<00:02:19.650> all<00:02:20.610> I<00:02:20.640> do<00:02:20.819> is<00:02:21.030> just

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
to the forward position all I do is just

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:23.420 
to the forward position all I do is just
bring<00:02:21.420> the<00:02:21.569> crank<00:02:21.840> stock<00:02:22.140> over<00:02:22.560> and<00:02:23.069> then

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
bring the crank stock over and then

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.050 
bring the crank stock over and then
unlock<00:02:23.880> the<00:02:25.130> mechanism<00:02:26.130> here<00:02:26.280> so<00:02:26.459> I<00:02:26.519> can<00:02:26.700> spin

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
unlock the mechanism here so I can spin

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.680 
unlock the mechanism here so I can spin
this<00:02:27.540> whole<00:02:28.010> prank<00:02:29.010> stock<00:02:29.280> around<00:02:29.579> lock<00:02:30.510> it

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
this whole prank stock around lock it

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:33.890 
this whole prank stock around lock it
back<00:02:30.870> in<00:02:30.930> and<00:02:31.709> now<00:02:31.950> I'm<00:02:32.340> pushing<00:02:32.910> forward<00:02:33.390> and

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
back in and now I'm pushing forward and

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.510 
back in and now I'm pushing forward and
going<00:02:34.230> more<00:02:34.440> into

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 
going more into

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.150 
going more into
my<00:02:35.880> forward<00:02:36.300> motion<00:02:36.990> and<00:02:37.200> my<00:02:37.530> backward<00:02:37.980> motion

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
my forward motion and my backward motion

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.430 
my forward motion and my backward motion
again<00:02:39.060> I<00:02:39.090> can<00:02:39.330> adjust<00:02:39.660> the<00:02:39.870> stock<00:02:40.170> at<00:02:40.350> any

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
again I can adjust the stock at any

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:51.430 
again I can adjust the stock at any
level<00:02:40.850> train<00:02:41.850> I'm<00:02:42.000> going<00:02:42.030> to<00:02:42.330> get<00:02:42.450> to<00:02:42.630> a

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:51.440 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:53.870 

different<00:02:52.440> home<00:02:52.770> patterns<00:02:53.220> that<00:02:53.340> I<00:02:53.490> can<00:02:53.730> get

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
different home patterns that I can get

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:54.420 
different home patterns that I can get
here

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
here

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:58.030 
here
it<00:02:55.430> also<00:02:55.610> has<00:02:55.970> a<00:02:56.000> seat<00:02:56.450> that<00:02:56.690> is<00:02:56.720> removable<00:02:57.650> so

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
it also has a seat that is removable so

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.220 
it also has a seat that is removable so
if<00:02:58.490> I<00:02:58.580> had<00:02:58.730> a<00:02:58.760> wheelchair<00:02:59.240> client<00:02:59.690> or<00:02:59.990> if<00:03:00.110> I

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
if I had a wheelchair client or if I

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:02.230 
if I had a wheelchair client or if I
wanted<00:03:00.470> to<00:03:00.530> go<00:03:00.710> to<00:03:00.770> just<00:03:01.370> a<00:03:01.520> standing<00:03:02.060> position

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:02.240 
wanted to go to just a standing position

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:07.270 
wanted to go to just a standing position
I<00:03:02.870> could<00:03:03.680> also<00:03:04.510> do<00:03:05.510> that<00:03:05.780> or<00:03:06.170> roll<00:03:06.710> a<00:03:06.740> chair<00:03:07.070> in

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 
I could also do that or roll a chair in

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.190 
I could also do that or roll a chair in
here<00:03:07.520> and<00:03:08.150> it<00:03:08.300> really<00:03:08.510> makes<00:03:08.720> it<00:03:08.840> accessible

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
here and it really makes it accessible

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.150 
here and it really makes it accessible
for<00:03:09.680> the<00:03:10.430> end

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:12.160
