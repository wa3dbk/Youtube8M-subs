00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:11.440
 what do you think of where we shot this picture and above all how we did 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:12.939
 have shot this picture 

00:00:12.939 --> 00:00:15.129
 the foundation scientist 

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:18.169
 the critters the samples 

00:00:18.169 --> 00:00:20.140
 a comparison shows 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:21.260
 Photoshop 

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:22.960
 who was it 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:24.679
 of her is important 

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:26.759
 and the US is in dispute 

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:28.980
 I'll have you fake it 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.149
 and how long your eyes are facing the truth they do not always wake up 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:37.130
 - Photos on the Rohrer 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:40.270
 is directly in the backstroke so much under pressure 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:43.270
 not somewhere in the percent far ahead studio but 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.640
 Euro one Fr 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.609
 Just in the bedroom 

00:00:48.609 --> 00:00:52.879
 Spontaneous is already a device under things to try out and 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:54.470
 the whole with Aufsteckblitz 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:57.470
 the scepter 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.340
 the West must now finally again such a joke of not a study 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.559
 with the 34's from sources 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.680
 the collection a bit light shells practically already seen this button 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.420
 So here's the weight for 8 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.260
 if you think manual mode suffering now 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.500
 then there are these two places with two flashes here 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.880
 for those who use as a master and too seldom and who can 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.950
 flashing synchronously with each other 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:24.710
 and all the cities up here burglary Moers 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:27.310
 originally gëtt el 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:30.140
 in the moto2 will be 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.110
 that is the two will be in manual mode and can self 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:33.880
 determine 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:37.590
 how strong the lightning should be here we have simplicity and how to achieve it 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.950
 Of course we also demand that this be true 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.560
 or even a whole man 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.289
 but what does that all take advantage of 

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:47.080
 a spokesman told Apple 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:50.350
 therefore, here's 6 on the club in the middle 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:53.040
 spiced up by talking here 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.820
 now is alone here 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:57.820
 at one-quarter a quarter of all species and so on 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:01.250
 this option is now set 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.320
 and by the whole then just with it again 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:05.810
 the middle of march time 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:07.280
 so the wars already 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.509
 brighten up the modern 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.109
 set to a hype 

00:02:12.109 --> 00:02:15.109
 the based on the big crystal ball 

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:19.820
 even a quarter of the main town got big power hoisting 

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:22.059
 Baden-württemberg should 

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:23.029
 and she too
