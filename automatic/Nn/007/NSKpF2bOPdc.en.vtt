00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:09.300
 welcome to another guys review from net 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.519
 media are gabriel yáñez and now they 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:14.400
 We present a review from Colombia in 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.859
 the samsung latin forum 2013 is about 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.350
 the galaxy note 8 the most recent addition 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:21.630
 of tablets with the stylus spain of 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.100
 samsung obviously our first 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.779
 impressions of the device are 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.300
 concentrated on the size and weight 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.160
 it's a pretty comfortable device 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.779
 charge only one hand while with 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.120
 the other interacts with the screen 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:37.829
 according to the specifications weighs only 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:40.079
 338 grams and measures 21 centimeters by 3.5 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.000
 centimeters but our hands this is 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.219
 translated to be carrying more or less a 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.230
 medium size notebook letter thing 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.270
 luís alberto vargas senior director of 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.160
 marketing for samsung colombia says that 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.219
 it was precisely the point of inspiration 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.289
 but let him talk about it is 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.750
 much like a notebook is 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:01.309
 previous if they see it closed a 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.309
 book as we say in Mexico not 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:06.610
 it's a new size it 's a super screen 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:08.500
 good and has the characteristic and how 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:10.450
 I told them we want to make a new diary 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:13.360
 staff there are many people especially the 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:15.550
 women who carry notebooks in their bag 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.650
 in your backpack we want you to change 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:19.030
 this then for example what we have 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:22.390
 done something very innovative that we have done 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:24.490
 is already directly from the calendar 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:26.260
 I can take notes then I can 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:29.250
 say valley as if it were a calendar 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:32.700
 of wall I do not say there with 30 of 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.700
 birthday my girlfriends 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:40.850
 Note 8 has that name because its screen 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:42.980
 it is 8 inches despite the size 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:45.110
 has the same total number of pixels 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:48.470
 that his sister of 10 inches is to say 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:50.810
 1200 x 800 pixels but in the case of the 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:52.930
 Note 8 means more pixels and better 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:56.120
 definition than the ipad mini screen 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:57.650
 approximately 10% better besides the 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:59.600
 Spain sensitivity is 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:01.880
 considerably more satisfactory than 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.010
 tablets with windows 8 x responds 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:06.170
 more precisely and in some 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:08.060
 specialized applications is also 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:10.190
 sensitive to different levels of pressure 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:12.260
 this thanks to the inheritance that samsung 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:14.760
 does with huacón to produce the 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:16.890
 family screen 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.280
 I can at the same time I see a 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.280
 Photo 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:22.980
 I can 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:27.780
 I can for example see the maps 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:34.150
 imagine, they make me a call, I'm 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:36.610
 of vacations in tulum and my boss I 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:38.320
 calls and puts me to work us I 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:40.330
 I receive the call on a screen and in 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:41.950
 the other one I start making notes 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:43.360
 open excel files graphics 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:45.940
 build what I want then this 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:47.500
 It is very very comfortable on the sides of the 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:50.740
 device we found a slot 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:52.180
 microsd slot for sim cards what 

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:54.460
 allows it to function also as a 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:56.800
 phone underneath has two speakers 

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:59.350
 small on the bottom right side is 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:00.970
 the slot where the stylus of the 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:03.010
 the right side is the power button 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:04.690
 the volume controls and up to a 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:06.610
 infrared port to control the 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:08.410
 TV and other consumer devices 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:11.080
 above it has the entrance to 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:13.570
 hearing aids and in front is the horn of 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:16.300
 headset proximity sensors and a 

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:17.709
 1.3 megapixel camera in the part 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:20.080
 the lower front are the classics 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:22.360
 back android controls button 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:24.730
 main and menu and back only 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:26.410
 has the 5 megapixel camera in 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:28.360
 Regarding how they will look like 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:30.910
 account follows the family trend 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:32.709
 no and the samsung galaxy s3 with plastic 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:34.210
 white satin that some what 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:35.730
 consider as a place 

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:39.040
 but I find it quite personal 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:40.480
 attractive about sadly performance 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:42.310
 we did not have the opportunity to put 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:44.830
 test the quad-core processor to 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:47.290
 1.6 giga hertz but being that it is better 

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:49.930
 and faster than the galaxy s3 and even 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:51.640
 that of note 10.1 surely not 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:54.580
 will have any problem to run to 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:55.900
 android 4.1.2 ji liping nor the 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:58.390
 special applications for 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:00.250
 unfortunately samsung device still 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:02.380
 it has no price for the nou nor in mexico 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:03.850
 and throughout Latin America which will 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:05.890
 will significantly affect the 

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:07.660
 rating on our scale but for 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:09.520
 the components that make up the device 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:11.620
 is likely to cost more than an ipad 

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:14.290
 mini since technically speaking it has 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:15.790
 best specifications ojala samsung 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:18.340
 surprise us on this topic 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:20.650
 as soon as you announce an official price for 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:22.600
 conclude samsung galaxy note 8 is 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:24.190
 probably the best tablet option 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:26.140
 that one can get in the market 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:28.330
 but if you already have a tablet more or 

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:30.250
 less recent and more specifically if 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:32.080
 this tablet is naut this new size 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:34.000
 will not give you enough news 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:35.740
 so that it's worth the expense 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.780
 Phone function is definitely useful 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:39.940
 but totally in practice if you are going to 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:41.080
 bring the device to sugar so 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:43.800
 it is always recommended 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:45.900
 the free ones always 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:47.819
 this was the wish review of this week 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:50.270
 I hope you liked it we'll see you in the 

00:04:47.819 --> 00:04:50.270
 next
