I<00:00:41.399> played<00:00:41.700> it<00:00:41.850> 3-1<00:00:42.120> and<00:00:42.210> 80s<00:00:42.570> you<00:00:42.780> later<00:00:42.960> on

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
I played it 3-1 and 80s you later on

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.139 
I played it 3-1 and 80s you later on
it's<00:00:43.410> right<00:00:43.559> different<00:00:44.219> ranks<00:00:44.489> of<00:00:44.670> drum

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
it's right different ranks of drum

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.119 
it's right different ranks of drum
troopers<00:00:45.510> so<00:00:45.989> the<00:00:46.500> biggest<00:00:46.680> thing<00:00:46.800> is<00:00:46.980> that<00:00:47.070> he

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
troopers so the biggest thing is that he

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.190 
troopers so the biggest thing is that he
gets<00:00:47.579> like<00:00:47.820> significantly<00:00:48.570> harder<00:00:48.780> over<00:00:49.050> the

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
gets like significantly harder over the

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.869 
gets like significantly harder over the
six<00:00:49.649> rounds<00:00:49.860> that<00:00:49.920> I<00:00:50.010> played<00:00:50.250> okay<00:00:50.610> so<00:00:50.670> like

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
six rounds that I played okay so like

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.580 
six rounds that I played okay so like
any<00:00:51.030> hold<00:00:51.239> movie<00:00:51.449> but<00:00:51.660> bigger<00:00:52.140> and<00:00:52.350> bigger<00:00:52.500> and

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
any hold movie but bigger and bigger and

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.680 
any hold movie but bigger and bigger and
bigger<00:00:52.829> way<00:00:52.980> yeah<00:00:53.160> right<00:00:53.430> yep<00:00:53.730> the<00:00:54.390> difference

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
bigger way yeah right yep the difference

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.360 
bigger way yeah right yep the difference
with<00:00:54.780> is<00:00:54.989> this<00:00:55.410> hormone<00:00:55.739> actually<00:00:56.010> has<00:00:56.100> an<00:00:56.160> end

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
with is this hormone actually has an end

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.580 
with is this hormone actually has an end
so<00:00:56.640> the<00:00:57.329> one<00:00:57.449> that<00:00:57.600> we<00:00:57.690> played<00:00:57.960> ended<00:00:58.230> at<00:00:58.350> six

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
so the one that we played ended at six

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:59.869 
so the one that we played ended at six
rounds<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:58.949> one<00:00:59.070> in<00:00:59.160> the<00:00:59.250> game<00:00:59.430> they<00:00:59.579> told<00:00:59.820> me

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
rounds the one in the game they told me

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.330 
rounds the one in the game they told me
would<00:01:00.059> end<00:01:00.270> at<00:01:00.420> 15<00:01:00.780> rounds<00:01:01.140> right<00:01:01.559> okay<00:01:01.949> I've

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:27.770 
where I actually one of the problems was

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:30.220 
where I actually one of the problems was
so<00:02:28.310> the<00:02:28.430> map<00:02:28.610> i<00:02:28.730> played<00:02:28.940> on<00:02:28.970> was<00:02:29.420> this<00:02:29.840> map<00:02:30.050> in<00:02:30.170> a

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
so the map i played on was this map in a

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:31.839 
so the map i played on was this map in a
canyon<00:02:30.500> it<00:02:30.769> looked<00:02:31.130> pretty<00:02:31.370> good<00:02:31.610> like<00:02:31.819> it

00:02:31.839 --> 00:02:31.849 
canyon it looked pretty good like it

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:33.610 
canyon it looked pretty good like it
looked<00:02:32.120> like<00:02:32.300> again<00:02:32.989> it<00:02:33.110> was<00:02:33.200> out<00:02:33.290> of<00:02:33.380> a<00:02:33.440> Star

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
looked like again it was out of a Star

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:35.050 
looked like again it was out of a Star
Wars<00:02:33.650> movie<00:02:33.769> but<00:02:34.099> the<00:02:34.160> problem<00:02:34.489> was<00:02:34.610> because

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
Wars movie but the problem was because

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.540 
Wars movie but the problem was because
my<00:02:35.599> screen<00:02:36.410> was<00:02:36.560> so<00:02:36.680> small<00:02:36.950> because<00:02:37.160> it<00:02:37.340> was<00:02:37.430> so

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:37.550 
my screen was so small because it was so

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:39.759 
my screen was so small because it was so
narrow<00:02:37.819> the<00:02:38.480> map<00:02:38.690> was<00:02:38.840> super<00:02:39.170> vertical<00:02:39.560> and<00:02:39.680> so

00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:39.769 
narrow the map was super vertical and so

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:41.589 
narrow the map was super vertical and so
I<00:02:39.800> had<00:02:39.920> a<00:02:39.980> pretty<00:02:40.550> hard<00:02:40.670> time<00:02:40.910> I<00:02:41.269> split<00:02:41.480> goes

00:02:41.589 --> 00:02:41.599 
I had a pretty hard time I split goes

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:44.350 
I had a pretty hard time I split goes
down<00:02:41.750> yeah<00:02:41.930> I<00:02:42.340> goes<00:02:43.340> down<00:02:43.519> horizontally<00:02:44.030> in

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360 
down yeah I goes down horizontally in

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:47.320 
down yeah I goes down horizontally in
middle<00:02:44.599> and<00:02:44.780> so<00:02:45.260> I<00:02:45.500> had<00:02:45.769> to<00:02:45.799> you<00:02:46.370> know<00:02:46.489> it<00:02:47.120> was

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:47.330 
middle and so I had to you know it was

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:48.940 
middle and so I had to you know it was
hard<00:02:47.480> as<00:02:47.630> I<00:02:47.750> sometimes<00:02:48.380> keep<00:02:48.590> track<00:02:48.799> of<00:02:48.830> the

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
hard as I sometimes keep track of the

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:50.410 
hard as I sometimes keep track of the
storm<00:02:49.040> troopers<00:02:49.459> because<00:02:49.880> you<00:02:50.030> know<00:02:50.120> I<00:02:50.150> could

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 
storm troopers because you know I could

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:52.660 
storm troopers because you know I could
I<00:02:50.750> was<00:02:50.989> on<00:02:51.140> the<00:02:51.319> canyon<00:02:51.650> floor<00:02:51.769> a<00:02:52.190> storm

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:52.670 
I was on the canyon floor a storm

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:54.759 
I was on the canyon floor a storm
trooper<00:02:52.760> was<00:02:53.090> you<00:02:53.360> know<00:02:53.480> way<00:02:53.959> above<00:02:54.230> the<00:02:54.590> lack

00:02:54.759 --> 00:02:54.769 
trooper was you know way above the lack

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:56.920 
trooper was you know way above the lack
of<00:02:54.799> stability<00:02:55.160> of<00:02:55.640> it<00:02:55.760> yeah<00:02:55.940> yep<00:02:56.450> and<00:02:56.660> so

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
of stability of it yeah yep and so

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:58.990 
of stability of it yeah yep and so
occasionally<00:02:57.230> I<00:02:57.440> would<00:02:58.160> run<00:02:58.730> into<00:02:58.910> the

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000 
occasionally I would run into the

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.699 
occasionally I would run into the
situation<00:02:59.510> where<00:02:59.660> there<00:03:00.140> would<00:03:00.290> be<00:03:00.349> someone

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:00.709 
situation where there would be someone

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:02.229 
situation where there would be someone
shooting<00:03:00.980> at<00:03:01.069> me<00:03:01.190> and<00:03:01.430> I<00:03:01.519> was<00:03:01.670> looking<00:03:02.000> all

00:03:02.229 --> 00:03:02.239 
shooting at me and I was looking all

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:03.460 
shooting at me and I was looking all
around<00:03:02.360> looking<00:03:02.780> up<00:03:02.870> and<00:03:02.989> down<00:03:03.049> and<00:03:03.349> just

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.470 
around looking up and down and just

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:04.930 
around looking up and down and just
because<00:03:03.739> my<00:03:03.860> screen<00:03:04.099> is<00:03:04.130> so<00:03:04.340> small<00:03:04.519> right<00:03:04.580> and

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:04.940 
because my screen is so small right and

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:06.280 
because my screen is so small right and
actually<00:03:05.269> see<00:03:05.450> there<00:03:05.599> that<00:03:05.630> sounds<00:03:05.900> like<00:03:06.140> me

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
actually see there that sounds like me

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:07.690 
actually see there that sounds like me
every<00:03:06.560> single<00:03:06.799> game<00:03:06.890> I<00:03:06.950> play<00:03:07.310> by<00:03:07.519> doing

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:07.700 
every single game I play by doing

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:09.550 
every single game I play by doing
another<00:03:07.819> excuse<00:03:08.330> yeah<00:03:08.540> i<00:03:08.569> mean<00:03:08.720> i<00:03:09.019> don't<00:03:09.500> know

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560 
another excuse yeah i mean i don't know

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:10.839 
another excuse yeah i mean i don't know
like<00:03:09.739> it<00:03:09.950> could<00:03:10.250> have<00:03:10.280> been<00:03:10.400> just<00:03:10.459> that<00:03:10.730> I'm

00:03:10.839 --> 00:03:10.849 
like it could have been just that I'm

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:12.880 
like it could have been just that I'm
bad<00:03:11.030> but<00:03:11.269> I<00:03:11.330> actually<00:03:11.480> thought<00:03:11.900> that<00:03:12.200> it<00:03:12.739> was

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:12.890 
bad but I actually thought that it was

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:15.640 
bad but I actually thought that it was
it<00:03:13.610> just<00:03:13.849> wasn't<00:03:14.239> that<00:03:14.330> visible<00:03:14.750> okay<00:03:15.080> kids

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:15.650 
it just wasn't that visible okay kids

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:17.080 
it just wasn't that visible okay kids
these<00:03:15.769> days<00:03:15.830> love<00:03:16.190> to<00:03:16.340> talk<00:03:16.459> about<00:03:16.580> frame<00:03:16.910> rate

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.090 
these days love to talk about frame rate

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:18.849 
these days love to talk about frame rate
so<00:03:17.239> let's<00:03:17.390> talk<00:03:17.480> about<00:03:17.540> frame<00:03:17.870> rate<00:03:18.079> so<00:03:18.440> the

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:18.859 
so let's talk about frame rate so the

00:03:18.859 --> 00:03:21.099 
so let's talk about frame rate so the
this<00:03:19.250> is<00:03:19.370> another<00:03:19.549> problem<00:03:19.790> it<00:03:20.120> felt<00:03:20.540> a<00:03:20.750> little

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:21.109 
this is another problem it felt a little

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:23.080 
this is another problem it felt a little
in<00:03:21.380> precise<00:03:21.799> because<00:03:22.040> the<00:03:22.430> game<00:03:22.609> was<00:03:22.640> running

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
in precise because the game was running

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:25.330 
in precise because the game was running
at<00:03:23.180> 30<00:03:23.390> frames<00:03:23.480> a<00:03:23.690> second<00:03:23.989> and<00:03:24.109> I'm<00:03:24.250> used<00:03:25.250> to

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340 
at 30 frames a second and I'm used to

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:26.800 
at 30 frames a second and I'm used to
shooters<00:03:25.609> running<00:03:25.880> at<00:03:25.940> 60<00:03:26.239> frames<00:03:26.269> a<00:03:26.510> second

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:26.810 
shooters running at 60 frames a second

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:28.780 
shooters running at 60 frames a second
right<00:03:27.109> icon<00:03:27.470> how<00:03:27.680> important<00:03:28.040> is<00:03:28.130> that<00:03:28.160> like<00:03:28.489> a

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:28.790 
right icon how important is that like a

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:30.460 
right icon how important is that like a
shooter<00:03:29.180> running<00:03:29.420> at<00:03:29.510> 60<00:03:29.750> frames<00:03:29.780> a<00:03:30.109> second

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:30.470 
shooter running at 60 frames a second

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:32.050 
shooter running at 60 frames a second
always<00:03:30.739> that<00:03:30.950> such<00:03:31.160> a<00:03:31.250> big<00:03:31.370> deal<00:03:31.430> so<00:03:31.760> it's

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:32.060 
always that such a big deal so it's

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:33.580 
always that such a big deal so it's
really<00:03:32.299> it's<00:03:32.630> a<00:03:32.780> big<00:03:32.810> deal<00:03:33.079> for<00:03:33.140> precision

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:33.590 
really it's a big deal for precision

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:35.349 
really it's a big deal for precision
with<00:03:33.829> timing<00:03:34.160> like<00:03:34.370> timing<00:03:34.700> of<00:03:34.760> shots<00:03:35.000> like<00:03:35.180> if

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:35.359 
with timing like timing of shots like if

00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:36.880 
with timing like timing of shots like if
you<00:03:35.540> you<00:03:35.810> know<00:03:36.049> if<00:03:36.170> you're<00:03:36.440> lining<00:03:36.620> up<00:03:36.799> a<00:03:36.859> shot

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:36.890 
you you know if you're lining up a shot

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:38.440 
you you know if you're lining up a shot
you<00:03:37.280> want<00:03:37.430> to<00:03:37.609> know<00:03:37.760> that<00:03:38.000> when<00:03:38.150> you<00:03:38.180> pull<00:03:38.420> the

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:38.450 
you want to know that when you pull the

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:39.550 
you want to know that when you pull the
trigger<00:03:38.630> there's<00:03:38.959> very<00:03:39.260> little<00:03:39.440> difference

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:39.560 
trigger there's very little difference

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:41.110 
trigger there's very little difference
between<00:03:39.980> when<00:03:40.400> you<00:03:40.489> pull<00:03:40.640> the<00:03:40.670> trigger<00:03:40.819> when

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.120 
between when you pull the trigger when

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.390 
between when you pull the trigger when
the<00:03:41.209> shotguns<00:03:41.540> are<00:03:41.630> your<00:03:41.810> gun<00:03:41.989> so<00:03:42.620> the<00:03:43.100> higher

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:43.400 
the shotguns are your gun so the higher

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.759 
the shotguns are your gun so the higher
the<00:03:43.579> frame<00:03:43.760> rate<00:03:43.940> the<00:03:44.120> more<00:03:44.150> that<00:03:45.079> is<00:03:45.380> like

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:45.769 
the frame rate the more that is like

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:48.520 
the frame rate the more that is like
instantaneous<00:03:46.220> gochu<00:03:47.000> okay<00:03:47.450> yeah<00:03:47.900> and<00:03:48.049> we

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:48.530 
instantaneous gochu okay yeah and we

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:49.840 
instantaneous gochu okay yeah and we
both<00:03:48.799> saw<00:03:48.950> the<00:03:48.980> trailer<00:03:49.280> yesterday<00:03:49.430> we<00:03:49.790> were

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:49.850 
both saw the trailer yesterday we were

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:51.729 
both saw the trailer yesterday we were
both<00:03:50.000> super<00:03:50.359> excited<00:03:50.989> by<00:03:51.109> I<00:03:51.139> think<00:03:51.560> there's<00:03:51.680> a

00:03:51.729 --> 00:03:51.739 
both super excited by I think there's a

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:53.379 
both super excited by I think there's a
ton<00:03:52.190> of<00:03:52.220> potential<00:03:52.639> in<00:03:52.819> this<00:03:52.940> game<00:03:53.120> than<00:03:53.299> you

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:53.389 
ton of potential in this game than you

00:03:53.389 --> 00:03:55.270 
ton of potential in this game than you
think<00:03:53.510> yeah<00:03:53.930> I<00:03:53.959> do<00:03:54.170> too<00:03:54.260> and<00:03:54.560> I<00:03:54.650> think<00:03:54.889> the

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:55.280 
think yeah I do too and I think the

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:56.740 
think yeah I do too and I think the
co-op<00:03:55.579> mode<00:03:55.730> that<00:03:55.819> I<00:03:55.940> saw<00:03:56.150> was<00:03:56.359> you<00:03:56.660> know

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:56.750 
co-op mode that I saw was you know

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:58.479 
co-op mode that I saw was you know
pretty<00:03:56.959> road<00:03:57.290> as<00:03:57.440> far<00:03:57.620> as<00:03:57.739> hormones<00:03:58.130> go<00:03:58.280> but

00:03:58.479 --> 00:03:58.489 
pretty road as far as hormones go but

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:00.610 
pretty road as far as hormones go but
like<00:03:58.609> again<00:03:59.239> like<00:03:59.269> I<00:03:59.510> said<00:03:59.540> that<00:03:59.900> just<00:04:00.530> the

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:00.620 
like again like I said that just the

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:03.370 
like again like I said that just the
style<00:04:00.920> of<00:04:01.069> it<00:04:01.190> is<00:04:01.310> amazing<00:04:01.880> and<00:04:02.060> I'm<00:04:02.840> really

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:03.380 
style of it is amazing and I'm really

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:04.539 
style of it is amazing and I'm really
going<00:04:03.470> to<00:04:03.530> have<00:04:03.650> to<00:04:03.680> see<00:04:03.889> you<00:04:04.190> know<00:04:04.280> the<00:04:04.400> actual

00:04:04.539 --> 00:04:04.549 
going to have to see you know the actual

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:05.920 
going to have to see you know the actual
multiplayer<00:04:05.150> before<00:04:05.420> I'm<00:04:05.510> going<00:04:05.630> to<00:04:05.690> make<00:04:05.810> any

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:05.930 
multiplayer before I'm going to make any

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:07.330 
multiplayer before I'm going to make any
judgment<00:04:06.319> about<00:04:06.470> the<00:04:06.590> game<00:04:06.739> what<00:04:06.980> well<00:04:07.220> the

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:07.340 
judgment about the game what well the

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:09.430 
judgment about the game what well the
multiplayer<00:04:07.670> is<00:04:07.880> absolutely<00:04:08.359> fantastic<00:04:08.540> but

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:09.440 
multiplayer is absolutely fantastic but

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:11.800 
multiplayer is absolutely fantastic but
how<00:04:10.130> much<00:04:10.340> you<00:04:10.459> think<00:04:10.519> this<00:04:10.730> co-op<00:04:11.150> mode<00:04:11.569> will

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:11.810 
how much you think this co-op mode will

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:14.740 
how much you think this co-op mode will
add<00:04:11.959> to<00:04:12.470> display<00:04:12.920> I<00:04:13.130> really<00:04:13.819> like<00:04:14.030> my

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:14.750 
add to display I really like my

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:16.120 
add to display I really like my
knee-jerk<00:04:14.989> reaction<00:04:15.530> right<00:04:15.620> now<00:04:15.769> is<00:04:15.920> that<00:04:16.010> it

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:16.130 
knee-jerk reaction right now is that it

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:17.740 
knee-jerk reaction right now is that it
won't<00:04:16.310> add<00:04:16.430> too<00:04:16.639> much<00:04:16.789> it<00:04:17.000> feels<00:04:17.180> kind<00:04:17.510> of<00:04:17.570> just

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:17.750 
won't add too much it feels kind of just

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:20.050 
won't add too much it feels kind of just
like<00:04:17.810> a<00:04:17.900> co-op<00:04:18.289> you<00:04:18.709> know<00:04:18.799> like<00:04:18.889> a<00:04:18.950> tack<00:04:19.850> on

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:21.759
