00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:05.599
 during breastfeeding is very important 

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:07.760
 remove all the milk from the breasts to 

00:00:05.599 --> 00:00:10.250
 avoid so infections for this are 

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:12.740
 the breast pumps but what types are there which 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:15.380
 is the best and the most important thing you knew 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:16.789
 that are not always necessary there are many 

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:17.090
 people who buy it before giving to 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:19.250
 light 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:21.080
 I do not recommend it, I think it's better 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:23.270
 wait to see if you need it or not 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:25.340
 because there are children who do not need 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:26.770
 they suck enough do not need 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:30.800
 that the mother uses a breast pump 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:33.620
 then when it is necessary when not 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.420
 they have milk at the beginning that still does not 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:38.920
 have had a milk rise or when 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:42.489
 they have too much to remove and freeze 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:44.679
 or when the wrong child or mom then 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:47.530
 try to combine breastfeeding with 

00:00:44.679 --> 00:00:49.690
 bottle yes, if you're thinking about 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:52.000
 buying a breast pump is important that 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:54.940
 among the existing types, choose the 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.159
 more suitable to your situation there saga 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:01:00.219
 manual milk and electric breast pumps 

00:00:57.159 --> 00:01:02.350
 the manuals are the most basic and 

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:04.119
 they simply work by suction and 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:06.720
 then the electric ones their fiction the 

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:10.380
 makes a motor that leads are more comfortable 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:13.300
 they are better and there is the breast pump 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.920
 normal electrical and another that imitates the 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:17.110
 way of suckling the child who has two 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:20.710
 speeds and two different ways of 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:22.299
 suction then these breast pumps are 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:25.479
 more expensive but it really is the most 

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:26.580
 similar to how the child as the child 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:28.560
 mom 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.780
 but if you're going to have to use it often 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:34.460
 use an electric one since you will lose 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.460
 Less time extracting milk
