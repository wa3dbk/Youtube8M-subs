announcement that at one time there was
a<00:00:07.919> massive<00:00:08.280> ancient<00:00:08.760> ocean<00:00:09.630> on<00:00:09.809> Mars<00:00:11.179> many<00:00:12.179> now

caused<00:00:16.080> that<00:00:16.289> ocean<00:00:16.800> to<00:00:16.890> disappear<00:00:17.520> and<00:00:17.640> the

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
caused that ocean to disappear and the

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.660 
caused that ocean to disappear and the
atmosphere<00:00:18.180> to<00:00:18.690> thin<00:00:18.900> out<00:00:19.580> well<00:00:20.580> they're

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
atmosphere to thin out well they're

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.120 
atmosphere to thin out well they're
saying<00:00:20.970> now<00:00:21.060> that<00:00:21.600> after<00:00:22.380> all<00:00:22.529> this<00:00:22.769> talk<00:00:23.100> of

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130

wanting to send colonies to Mars a lot

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.030 
wanting to send colonies to Mars a lot
of<00:00:33.390> these<00:00:33.510> have<00:00:33.809> been<00:00:33.960> talks<00:00:34.320> of<00:00:34.500> one-way

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
of these have been talks of one-way

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.410 
of these have been talks of one-way
trips<00:00:36.140> because<00:00:37.140> of<00:00:37.350> energy<00:00:37.920> in<00:00:38.129> being<00:00:38.969> able<00:00:39.090> to

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
trips because of energy in being able to

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.020 
trips because of energy in being able to
have<00:00:39.540> the<00:00:39.660> power<00:00:39.840> to<00:00:39.989> get<00:00:40.260> back<00:00:40.879> well<00:00:41.879> they're

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
have the power to get back well they're

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.630 
have the power to get back well they're
now<00:00:42.180> saying<00:00:42.739> that<00:00:43.739> because<00:00:43.920> of<00:00:44.190> all<00:00:44.370> of<00:00:44.399> this

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
now saying that because of all of this

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.779 
now saying that because of all of this
dry<00:00:45.000> ice<00:00:45.270> that<00:00:45.989> sits<00:00:46.320> in<00:00:46.469> the<00:00:46.680> caps<00:00:46.950> or<00:00:47.579> in<00:00:47.700> the

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
dry ice that sits in the caps or in the

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.680 
dry ice that sits in the caps or in the
polar<00:00:48.000> regions<00:00:49.280> that<00:00:50.280> dry<00:00:50.610> ice<00:00:50.850> can<00:00:51.180> be<00:00:51.300> used

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
polar regions that dry ice can be used

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.709 
polar regions that dry ice can be used
as<00:00:51.930> energy<00:00:53.210> now<00:00:54.210> in<00:00:54.449> theory<00:00:55.100> how<00:00:56.100> this<00:00:56.370> works

00:00:56.709 --> 00:00:56.719 
as energy now in theory how this works

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:01.279 
as energy now in theory how this works
it's<00:00:57.719> like<00:00:57.989> taking<00:00:59.510> water<00:01:00.510> and<00:01:00.809> dropping<00:01:01.199> it

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
it's like taking water and dropping it

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:02.689 
it's like taking water and dropping it
onto<00:01:01.440> a<00:01:01.590> hot<00:01:01.800> surface<00:01:02.070> it's<00:01:02.489> going<00:01:02.640> to

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
onto a hot surface it's going to

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.270 
onto a hot surface it's going to
evaporate<00:01:03.589> well<00:01:04.589> they<00:01:04.680> want<00:01:04.860> to<00:01:04.920> use<00:01:05.070> these

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
evaporate well they want to use these

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.870 
evaporate well they want to use these
blocks<00:01:05.729> of<00:01:05.970> this<00:01:06.119> material<00:01:06.330> and<00:01:07.640> they<00:01:08.640> say

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
blocks of this material and they say

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.230 
blocks of this material and they say
that<00:01:09.119> the<00:01:09.810> secret<00:01:10.290> lies<00:01:10.950> in<00:01:10.979> carbon<00:01:11.670> dioxide

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
that the secret lies in carbon dioxide

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.960 
that the secret lies in carbon dioxide
and<00:01:12.680> that<00:01:13.680> the<00:01:13.799> principle<00:01:14.280> is<00:01:14.310> no<00:01:14.549> different

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
and that the principle is no different

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.730 
and that the principle is no different
to<00:01:15.299> what<00:01:15.390> happens<00:01:15.780> when<00:01:15.960> you<00:01:16.049> observe<00:01:16.380> the

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
to what happens when you observe the

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.460 
to what happens when you observe the
effect<00:01:17.070> of<00:01:17.159> a<00:01:17.250> drop<00:01:17.490> of<00:01:17.520> water<00:01:17.670> on<00:01:18.150> a<00:01:18.930> scolding

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
effect of a drop of water on a scolding

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.210 
effect of a drop of water on a scolding
hot<00:01:19.590> surface<00:01:20.240> that<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.600> energy<00:01:21.990> it<00:01:22.590> generates

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
hot surface that the energy it generates

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.880 
hot surface that the energy it generates
will<00:01:23.939> funnel<00:01:24.240> up<00:01:24.540> and<00:01:24.810> if<00:01:24.900> they<00:01:25.049> can<00:01:25.259> harness

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
will funnel up and if they can harness

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.870 
will funnel up and if they can harness
this<00:01:26.310> as<00:01:27.590> they've<00:01:28.590> done<00:01:28.829> and<00:01:29.100> other<00:01:29.340> tests

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
this as they've done and other tests

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:36.280 
this as they've done and other tests
they<00:01:30.600> can<00:01:30.840> get<00:01:31.229> this<00:01:31.939> turbine<00:01:32.939> to<00:01:33.240> move<00:01:33.950> and

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:36.290 
they can get this turbine to move and

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:38.569 
they can get this turbine to move and
2013<00:01:37.290> they<00:01:37.439> said<00:01:37.680> that<00:01:37.770> there<00:01:37.920> were<00:01:38.009> massive

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
2013 they said that there were massive

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:42.080 
2013 they said that there were massive
deposits<00:01:38.880> of<00:01:39.270> dry<00:01:39.479> ice<00:01:39.509> on<00:01:39.990> Mars<00:01:40.610> so<00:01:41.610> if<00:01:41.909> they

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
deposits of dry ice on Mars so if they

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.230 
deposits of dry ice on Mars so if they
can<00:01:42.240> harness<00:01:42.479> this<00:01:43.670> knowing<00:01:44.670> there's<00:01:44.850> massive

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
can harness this knowing there's massive

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.580 
can harness this knowing there's massive
deposits<00:01:45.540> there<00:01:46.430> well<00:01:47.600> they<00:01:48.600> have<00:01:48.840> a<00:01:48.869> way<00:01:49.170> or<00:01:49.560> a

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
deposits there well they have a way or a

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.530 
deposits there well they have a way or a
means<00:01:49.979> of<00:01:50.250> getting<00:01:50.460> energy<00:01:50.970> here

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.350 

that's<00:01:55.230> what<00:01:55.380> they're<00:01:55.500> talking<00:01:55.800> about<00:01:55.890> now

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:56.360 
that's what they're talking about now

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.980 
that's what they're talking about now
using<00:01:57.360> the<00:01:57.450> dry<00:01:57.660> ice<00:01:57.690> there<00:01:58.260> as<00:01:58.470> a<00:01:59.990> power

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990
