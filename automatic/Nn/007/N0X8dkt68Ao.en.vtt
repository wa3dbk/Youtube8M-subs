00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:05.339
 iii 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:07.620
 I apologize for the nasal voice due 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.960
 to the flu going to open 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:15.770
 you will find inside the 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:19.770
 charger with micro usb usb cable 

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:22.350
 headphones in ear for any 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:25.920
 coloring you will always choose 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:28.010
 white and associated adapters kg 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:32.790
 rubber pads for the various types of ear 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:35.100
 in those in which the manuals are 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.530
 slip of samsung excluded 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:40.290
 registering on the site now there is the 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:43.469
 gift galaxy music by cutting this 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:47.430
 there is a project to show the phone 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:49.219
 here it is in this black color 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:53.760
 is the cover that as you can imagine 

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:56.610
 removable I took it off because it took 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.300
 really many laughs and I was always a 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.980
 clean 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.570
 and besides, I didn't like his 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.820
 subtlety in its fragility 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.240
 so I replaced it in a similar minium 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.960
 which is absolutely not inherited 

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:09.119
 starting from having from 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.310
 technical features on the part 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:14.490
 at the rear we find an 8 camera 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:18.509
 megapixel autofocus flash led capable 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:21.180
 to record video in full hd at 1080p 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:24.270
 here are the boxes on the side 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:28.829
 the call back is the microphone 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:33.509
 the recess for the micro usb cable in the 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:36.420
 front part we will find the part 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:38.710
 top the notification led very nice 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.479
 very big 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:42.640
 the various brightness sensors e 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:43.360
 proximity and the 1.9 camera 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:48.700
 megapixel 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:51.640
 below we find the physical key the 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:54.580
 soft touch menu and back keys on the side 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:57.960
 right you will cast the volume on the side 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:02:01.149
 left and lock and unlock the phone 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:04.420
 staying on top 

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:10.959
 let's talk about the 4.8 inch hd screen 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:16.030
 super amoled 1200 80 x 720 and in the part 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:18.580
 instead back by removing the cover 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:20.320
 from here and I show you another 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:24.390
 small hole for noise reduction e 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:27.459
 the link for three and a half headphones 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:32.920
 going to remove through this 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:35.950
 this is where this is placed 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:39.610
 let's call in that we named so 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:45.070
 now renamed so it is under you can 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:48.840
 insert the sd micro sd memory up 

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:54.130
 at 64 gigabytes almost the proposed models 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:56.290
 echo internal memory are 16 32 and 64 with 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:03:01.630
 I have seen various types of color 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:04.239
 red white blue and black and nothing below 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:07.510
 you will also find a 2,100 battery 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:10.510
 milia for removable and entry 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:13.329
 obviously for the micro sim they were talking 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:17.760
 processor is a quad core exynos from 

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:20.350
 1.4 ghz and that's all 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.910
 I hope in short to receive gods 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:24.130
 positive comments this is my first 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:26.350

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:29.019

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:31.420

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:33.910
