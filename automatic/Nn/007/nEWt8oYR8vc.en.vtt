I'm going to do I'm gonna try up here

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:04.570 
I'm going to do I'm gonna try up here
beyond<00:05:02.690> this<00:05:03.380> part<00:05:03.740> and<00:05:04.040> it<00:05:04.340> should<00:05:04.550> be

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:04.580 
beyond this part and it should be

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:06.190 
beyond this part and it should be
thicker<00:05:05.060> we'll<00:05:05.210> just<00:05:05.360> test<00:05:05.540> it<00:05:05.660> out<00:05:05.780> anyway

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:06.200 
thicker we'll just test it out anyway
