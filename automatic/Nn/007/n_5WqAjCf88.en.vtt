00:00:03.529 --> 00:00:08.960 

so<00:00:04.529> at<00:00:05.250> the<00:00:05.400> final<00:00:05.700> stage<00:00:07.429> all<00:00:08.429> I<00:00:08.490> have<00:00:08.700> to<00:00:08.849> do

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
so at the final stage all I have to do

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.990 
so at the final stage all I have to do
is<00:00:09.120> fill<00:00:09.420> it<00:00:09.889> and<00:00:10.889> then<00:00:11.040> I<00:00:11.160> get<00:00:11.309> to<00:00:11.429> test<00:00:11.639> it<00:00:11.880> out

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
is fill it and then I get to test it out

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.430 
is fill it and then I get to test it out
so<00:00:12.420> that's<00:00:12.750> what<00:00:12.870> I'm<00:00:12.960> doing

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
so that's what I'm doing

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.540 
so that's what I'm doing
putting<00:00:14.070> three<00:00:14.219> gallons<00:00:14.790> in<00:00:16.369> two<00:00:17.369> directions

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
putting three gallons in two directions

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.849 
putting three gallons in two directions
again<00:00:18.210> weren't<00:00:18.690> clear<00:00:18.990> whether<00:00:19.289> or<00:00:19.439> not<00:00:19.560> it'll

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
again weren't clear whether or not it'll

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:21.679 
again weren't clear whether or not it'll
hold<00:00:20.100> the<00:00:20.220> three<00:00:20.400> gallons<00:00:20.730> right<00:00:20.820> off<00:00:21.300> the<00:00:21.510> bat

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
hold the three gallons right off the bat

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:26.359 
hold the three gallons right off the bat
or<00:00:22.310> whether<00:00:24.019> you<00:00:25.019> have<00:00:25.199> to<00:00:25.350> run<00:00:25.619> the<00:00:25.830> lift<00:00:26.070> and

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
or whether you have to run the lift and

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:31.990 
or whether you have to run the lift and
run<00:00:27.029> everything<00:00:27.240> through<00:00:27.390> it<00:00:27.720> first<00:00:28.400> so<00:00:29.400> I

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:32.000 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.080 

guess<00:00:33.000> I<00:00:33.149> should<00:00:33.329> go<00:00:33.480> easy<00:00:33.690> on<00:00:33.899> this<00:00:34.200> anyway<00:00:35.130> so

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
guess I should go easy on this anyway so

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:47.630 
guess I should go easy on this anyway so
I'm<00:00:36.210> gonna<00:00:36.329> fill<00:00:36.630> it<00:00:44.270> up<00:00:45.270> and<00:00:45.450> down<00:00:46.280> you<00:00:47.280> should

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
I'm gonna fill it up and down you should

00:00:47.640 --> 00:01:30.300 
I'm gonna fill it up and down you should
fill<00:00:47.969> everything<00:00:48.300> up<00:00:48.480> hydrographer<00:00:54.469> okay

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:30.310 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:34.450 

so<00:01:31.310> what<00:01:31.430> happened<00:01:31.850> is<00:01:32.090> the<00:01:33.080> cable<00:01:33.320> slid<00:01:34.280> off

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:34.460 
so what happened is the cable slid off

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.999 
so what happened is the cable slid off
of<00:01:34.490> the<00:01:34.820> pulley<00:01:35.090> because<00:01:35.869> it<00:01:36.020> was<00:01:36.140> so<00:01:36.440> slack

00:01:36.999 --> 00:01:37.009 
of the pulley because it was so slack

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:40.930 
of the pulley because it was so slack
when<00:01:37.400> you<00:01:37.490> first<00:01:37.790> lift<00:01:38.630> the<00:01:38.890> the<00:01:39.890> lift<00:01:40.160> all<00:01:40.880> of

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:40.940 
when you first lift the the lift all of

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:43.330 
when you first lift the the lift all of
the<00:01:41.240> cables<00:01:41.660> are<00:01:41.960> all<00:01:42.410> the<00:01:42.800> way<00:01:42.920> slacked

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:43.340 
the cables are all the way slacked

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.150 
the cables are all the way slacked
because<00:01:43.910> you<00:01:44.509> had<00:01:44.660> to<00:01:44.780> pull<00:01:45.020> a<00:01:45.320> cylinder<00:01:45.979> all

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:46.160 
because you had to pull a cylinder all

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:48.310 
because you had to pull a cylinder all
the<00:01:46.340> way<00:01:46.430> out<00:01:46.670> so<00:01:47.450> that<00:01:47.570> it<00:01:47.690> would<00:01:47.780> accept<00:01:48.170> all

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:48.320 
the way out so that it would accept all

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:50.410 
the way out so that it would accept all
the<00:01:48.440> hydraulic<00:01:48.920> fluid<00:01:49.100> but<00:01:49.940> when<00:01:50.300> the

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:50.420 
the hydraulic fluid but when the

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:51.820 
the hydraulic fluid but when the
cylinders<00:01:50.810> all<00:01:50.930> the<00:01:51.050> way<00:01:51.140> out<00:01:51.290> the<00:01:51.500> lift<00:01:51.680> is

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:51.830 
cylinders all the way out the lift is

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:53.260 
cylinders all the way out the lift is
supposed<00:01:52.070> to<00:01:52.160> be<00:01:52.280> on<00:01:52.369> the<00:01:52.490> ground<00:01:52.790> so<00:01:53.240> the

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.270 
supposed to be on the ground so the

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:55.240 
supposed to be on the ground so the
difference<00:01:53.810> between<00:01:54.020> being<00:01:54.830> on<00:01:55.009> the<00:01:55.130> ground

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:55.250 
difference between being on the ground

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:57.820 
difference between being on the ground
and<00:01:55.700> being<00:01:56.060> on<00:01:56.210> that<00:01:56.390> first<00:01:56.750> click<00:01:57.500> of<00:01:57.710> the

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:57.830 
and being on that first click of the

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:00.280 
and being on that first click of the
safety<00:01:58.220> ladder<00:01:58.430> you<00:01:59.090> have<00:01:59.240> that<00:01:59.420> much<00:01:59.630> slack

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:00.290 
safety ladder you have that much slack

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:02.830 
safety ladder you have that much slack
cable<00:02:00.920> and<00:02:01.280> in<00:02:01.880> this<00:02:02.000> one<00:02:02.240> spot<00:02:02.570> that<00:02:02.600> I'm

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:02.840 
cable and in this one spot that I'm

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.380 
cable and in this one spot that I'm
working<00:02:03.200> on<00:02:03.290> the<00:02:03.710> cable<00:02:04.100> because<00:02:04.940> it<00:02:05.270> was

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:05.390 
working on the cable because it was

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:07.090 
working on the cable because it was
drooping<00:02:05.750> these<00:02:06.440> cables<00:02:06.770> are<00:02:06.800> actually

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:07.100 
drooping these cables are actually

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.309 
drooping these cables are actually
pretty<00:02:07.220> heavy<00:02:07.460> it<00:02:08.149> drooped<00:02:08.569> and<00:02:08.810> it<00:02:08.990> kind<00:02:09.259> of

00:02:09.309 --> 00:02:09.319 
pretty heavy it drooped and it kind of

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:11.500 
pretty heavy it drooped and it kind of
fell<00:02:09.710> off<00:02:09.740> of<00:02:10.100> the<00:02:10.399> bottom<00:02:10.910> side<00:02:11.330> of<00:02:11.450> the

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
fell off of the bottom side of the

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:13.300 
fell off of the bottom side of the
pulley<00:02:11.690> but<00:02:11.990> I<00:02:12.050> found<00:02:12.380> and<00:02:12.890> I<00:02:12.950> didn't<00:02:13.220> do<00:02:13.280> a

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
pulley but I found and I didn't do a

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:14.710 
pulley but I found and I didn't do a
very<00:02:13.520> good<00:02:13.580> job<00:02:13.850> taking<00:02:14.120> a<00:02:14.240> video<00:02:14.360> of<00:02:14.630> this

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
very good job taking a video of this

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.500 
very good job taking a video of this
that<00:02:15.440> you<00:02:15.560> can<00:02:15.740> take<00:02:15.920> this<00:02:16.100> bolt<00:02:16.460> out<00:02:16.730> the<00:02:17.300> bolt

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
that you can take this bolt out the bolt

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:19.360 
that you can take this bolt out the bolt
that<00:02:17.660> has<00:02:17.780> a<00:02:17.810> little<00:02:18.020> tab<00:02:18.290> on<00:02:18.319> it<00:02:18.590> if<00:02:18.980> you<00:02:19.190> take

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
that has a little tab on it if you take

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.280 
that has a little tab on it if you take
that<00:02:19.550> out<00:02:19.610> you<00:02:19.760> can<00:02:20.150> slide<00:02:20.330> that<00:02:20.660> down<00:02:20.990> and

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
that out you can slide that down and

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:23.290 
that out you can slide that down and
that<00:02:21.350> basically<00:02:22.160> holds<00:02:22.490> the<00:02:22.610> pulley<00:02:22.850> in<00:02:23.030> place

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:23.300 
that basically holds the pulley in place

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:27.220 
that basically holds the pulley in place
and<00:02:23.800> when<00:02:24.800> you<00:02:24.920> do<00:02:25.040> that<00:02:25.280> you're<00:02:26.150> able<00:02:26.300> to<00:02:26.600> get

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
and when you do that you're able to get

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:31.920 
and when you do that you're able to get
the<00:02:27.350> cable<00:02:27.560> around<00:02:27.860> the<00:02:28.580> side<00:02:29.120> of<00:02:29.240> the<00:02:29.300> pulley

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:35.380 

so<00:02:32.930> for<00:02:33.170> the<00:02:33.260> rest<00:02:33.500> of<00:02:33.680> this<00:02:33.890> testing<00:02:34.640> period<00:02:35.120> I

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
so for the rest of this testing period I

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:39.180 
so for the rest of this testing period I
just<00:02:36.080> tapped<00:02:36.560> the<00:02:37.220> button<00:02:37.970> so<00:02:38.569> that<00:02:38.600> the<00:02:38.780> cable

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
just tapped the button so that the cable

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:42.030 
just tapped the button so that the cable
the<00:02:40.190> cables<00:02:40.490> would<00:02:40.580> take<00:02:40.760> up<00:02:40.940> very<00:02:41.090> slowly

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
the cables would take up very slowly

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.010 
the cables would take up very slowly
until<00:02:43.040> I<00:02:43.069> was<00:02:43.340> sure<00:02:43.610> I<00:02:43.940> walked<00:02:44.569> around<00:02:44.720> and

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:45.020 
until I was sure I walked around and

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:46.930 
until I was sure I walked around and
made<00:02:45.110> sure<00:02:45.290> every<00:02:45.530> pulley<00:02:45.740> was<00:02:45.920> in<00:02:46.160> every<00:02:46.580> Eric

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 
made sure every pulley was in every Eric

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:48.839 
made sure every pulley was in every Eric
every<00:02:47.209> cable<00:02:47.390> is<00:02:47.569> in<00:02:47.660> every<00:02:47.870> pulley<00:02:48.110> and<00:02:48.290> then

00:02:48.839 --> 00:02:48.849 
every cable is in every pulley and then

00:02:48.849 --> 00:03:14.690 
every cable is in every pulley and then
actually<00:02:49.849> the

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.940 

so<00:03:15.750> unbelievably<00:03:16.750> enough<00:03:17.049> I<00:03:17.290> missed<00:03:17.680> my

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:17.950 
so unbelievably enough I missed my

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:21.660 
so unbelievably enough I missed my

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:21.670 
opportunity to do a video or I can be

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:24.960 
opportunity to do a video or I can be
like<00:03:21.879> look<00:03:22.510> it<00:03:23.110> works<00:03:23.470> I'm<00:03:23.860> so<00:03:24.129> excited<00:03:24.519> I

00:03:27.059 --> 00:03:27.069 
don't know I don't know how that

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:28.140 
don't know I don't know how that
happened

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
happened

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:30.839 
happened
which<00:03:28.870> is<00:03:29.019> why<00:03:29.140> just<00:03:29.739> freeze-framed<00:03:30.459> on<00:03:30.819> a

00:03:30.839 --> 00:03:30.849 
which is why just freeze-framed on a

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:33.390 
which is why just freeze-framed on a
completely<00:03:31.510> random<00:03:32.049> frame<00:03:32.379> because<00:03:33.189> it's

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
completely random frame because it's

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:34.890 
completely random frame because it's
such<00:03:33.879> a<00:03:33.909> tragedy

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:34.900 
such a tragedy

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:37.039 
such a tragedy
that<00:03:35.439> I<00:03:35.470> put<00:03:35.739> all<00:03:35.890> this<00:03:36.069> effort<00:03:36.340> into

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:37.049 
that I put all this effort into

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:39.390 
that I put all this effort into
assembling<00:03:38.049> the<00:03:38.170> lifts<00:03:38.409> and<00:03:38.680> doing<00:03:39.159> all<00:03:39.280> the

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:39.400 
assembling the lifts and doing all the

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.319 
assembling the lifts and doing all the
videos<00:03:39.730> that<00:03:39.760> I<00:03:40.090> didn't<00:03:40.510> do<00:03:40.720> a<00:03:40.750> yey<00:03:41.500> video<00:03:42.459> so

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:43.329 
videos that I didn't do a yey video so

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:46.440 
videos that I didn't do a yey video so
anyway<00:03:43.810> this<00:03:44.379> is<00:03:44.440> the<00:03:44.620> yey<00:03:45.069> part<00:03:45.519> the<00:03:46.180> lift

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:46.450 
anyway this is the yey part the lift

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:49.530 
anyway this is the yey part the lift
works<00:03:46.750> woohoo
