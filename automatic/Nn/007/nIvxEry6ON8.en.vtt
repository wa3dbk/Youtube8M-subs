produce most of the rosin mascara and
those<00:01:08.560> studies<00:01:08.920> suggest<00:01:09.370> that<00:01:09.640> it's

those studies suggest that it's

was<00:01:20.920> done<00:01:21.100> in<00:01:21.580> Spain<00:01:22.180> and<00:01:23.370> the<00:01:24.370> researchers

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:24.940 
was done in Spain and the researchers

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:27.660 
was done in Spain and the researchers
applied<00:01:25.450> Rosa<00:01:25.780> mosquito<00:01:26.230> oil<00:01:26.500> to<00:01:26.740> leg<00:01:27.190> ulcers

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:27.670 
applied Rosa mosquito oil to leg ulcers

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:31.170 
applied Rosa mosquito oil to leg ulcers
and<00:01:28.120> also<00:01:28.660> scarring<00:01:29.290> after<00:01:29.470> surgery<00:01:30.340> and<00:01:30.670> they

and also scarring after surgery and they

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:33.480 
and also scarring after surgery and they
found<00:01:31.360> it<00:01:31.570> to<00:01:31.660> have<00:01:31.810> very<00:01:32.320> positive<00:01:32.650> results

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:33.490 
found it to have very positive results

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:37.200 
found it to have very positive results
when<00:01:34.390> compared<00:01:34.870> to<00:01:34.990> a<00:01:35.409> group<00:01:36.130> of<00:01:36.490> people<00:01:36.730> who

when compared to a group of people who

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:38.790 
when compared to a group of people who
had<00:01:37.390> the<00:01:37.540> same<00:01:37.570> sort<00:01:37.990> of<00:01:38.080> health<00:01:38.260> disorders

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:38.800 
had the same sort of health disorders

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:41.220 
had the same sort of health disorders
and<00:01:39.010> didn't<00:01:39.520> use<00:01:39.760> Rosa<00:01:40.150> mesquita<00:01:40.630> they<00:01:41.170> were

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:41.230 
and didn't use Rosa mesquita they were

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:44.280 
and didn't use Rosa mesquita they were
the<00:01:41.350> control<00:01:41.680> group<00:01:41.920> so<00:01:42.810> positive<00:01:43.810> results

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:44.290 
the control group so positive results

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:46.860 
the control group so positive results
from<00:01:44.590> that<00:01:45.100> study<00:01:45.510> certainly<00:01:46.510> in<00:01:46.600> my<00:01:46.720> own

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:46.870 
from that study certainly in my own

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:49.830 
from that study certainly in my own
experience<00:01:47.530> from<00:01:47.909> doing<00:01:48.909> this<00:01:49.060> a<00:01:49.420> number<00:01:49.510> of

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:49.840 
experience from doing this a number of

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.740 
experience from doing this a number of
years<00:01:49.930> I<00:01:50.490> found<00:01:51.490> that<00:01:51.670> people<00:01:52.000> who<00:01:52.180> use<00:01:52.510> Rosa

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:52.750 
years I found that people who use Rosa

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:55.590 
years I found that people who use Rosa
must<00:01:52.990> get<00:01:53.170> on<00:01:53.409> scars<00:01:53.860> on<00:01:54.430> acne<00:01:54.820> scars<00:01:55.150> it<00:01:55.420> seems

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:55.600 
must get on scars on acne scars it seems

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.870 
must get on scars on acne scars it seems
to<00:01:55.720> soften<00:01:56.050> the<00:01:56.590> scarring<00:01:57.100> and<00:01:57.310> it<00:01:57.700> really

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:57.880 
to soften the scarring and it really

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.780 
to soften the scarring and it really
does<00:01:58.150> really<00:01:58.659> amazingly<00:01:59.530> help<00:01:59.830> speed<00:02:00.370> up<00:02:00.400> the

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:00.790 
does really amazingly help speed up the

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:02.969 
does really amazingly help speed up the
healing<00:02:00.940> process<00:02:01.470> so<00:02:02.470> I<00:02:02.500> think<00:02:02.620> Rosa

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:02.979 
healing process so I think Rosa

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:05.520 
healing process so I think Rosa
mosquitoes<00:02:03.580> really<00:02:04.180> worth<00:02:04.450> giving<00:02:04.930> a<00:02:05.110> go<00:02:05.320> if

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:05.530 
mosquitoes really worth giving a go if

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:07.980 
mosquitoes really worth giving a go if
