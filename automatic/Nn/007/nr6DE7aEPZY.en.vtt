the thousand horsepower through these
stock<00:02:46.420> manifolds<00:02:47.049> so<00:02:47.260> he's<00:02:47.980> excited<00:02:48.400> to<00:02:48.489> see

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
stock manifolds so he's excited to see

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.940

what<00:02:48.819> we'll<00:02:48.910> do<00:02:49.030> with<00:02:49.150> headers<00:02:49.450> but<00:02:49.480> I<00:02:49.989> really

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
what we'll do with headers but I really

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:53.479 
what we'll do with headers but I really
like<00:02:51.100> the<00:02:51.280> elite<00:02:51.519> low<00:02:51.760> pressure<00:02:52.060> fuel<00:02:52.390> system
