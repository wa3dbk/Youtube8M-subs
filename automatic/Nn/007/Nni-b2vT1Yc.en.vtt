00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.850
 ok then what are we going to do is 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.670
 we're just going to show you 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.619
 different points that exist so the 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.020
 cosmos points that exist relative 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.189
 to the human body think of a thing is 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:27.360
 really I repeat it to you and I will 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.980
 will repeat all the time in all my 

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:30.630
 articles and in videos if you 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.010
 want to see my work on everything that 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.500
 is this centering point which complains 

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:35.970
 cosmos that binds to a past mayor trance 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.140
 on the sites of noses to g 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:39.239
 I advise you on our 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.300
 voice teachers of my teachers in 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:46.320
 the occurrence jessica and nicolas dp trice 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:49.350
 you go to www.pro spurs dot com 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.790
 and you will have a description of all 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.770
 elders to type what is going to be really 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:55.079
 interesting because you have to see that the 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.489
 centering winger a personality type 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.840
 is always great to know 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.230
 what were our strengths 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.690
 weaknesses 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.039
 what we are able to do how 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.500
 can evolve because in fact arts 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.729
 martial to move forward to evolve for 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.810
 become better in the lives of all 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:10.050
 day and that's really 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:12.570
 the importance then compared to that one 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:14.369
 will resume what we know in the 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:19.200
 bits of bone and in all that is 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:20.760
 fly where we have this famous stud where it a 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.119
 energy centers so that's it 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:22.979
 Okay 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:27.540
 no worries it exists dancing seniors 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:31.560
 a cheap on a plexus fsu 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:33.780
 solar we have a level of heart there that 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.700
 rather be the chakras going to see at 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.729
 throat level 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:43.860
 another level of the throat at the level of 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:47.579
 third eye on the top of the skull a 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:50.759
 who will be at the center of the shoulder blades and 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:52.409
 one who stops at the bottom of the back okay that 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:56.390
 will give us the 9 points if you 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:58.409
 notice that it follows well this line we have 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:59.970
 which is often put forward by 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.470
 relation to the chakra which I recall for 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:04.049
 those who know a little bit and who 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:06.060
 is interested in chakra sacral root of 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:08.130
 desires chakra emotions chakra of the 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.259
 chakra heart of communication each 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:13.170
 of perception and chaqra dia 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:14.730
 spirituality okay that's the seven 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.150
 major chakras so we realize that 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:19.030
 the 900 who read more 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.540
 - ah it's every race and centers 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.400
 energy 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.319
 okay it's interesting to be able 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:26.200
 and what can perhaps explain 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:28.150
 why a lot of Chinese discipline and 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.019
 especially a term but the one we 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.879
 knows best it's still 

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:33.189
 Chinese they really do worked 

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:36.420
 on the whole body and even when we 

00:02:33.189 --> 00:02:39.189
 is on postures like sudden rite 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.819
 posture of the tree in different 

00:02:39.189 --> 00:02:41.109
 disciplines 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:43.480
 you noticed that often there are 

00:02:41.109 --> 00:02:45.879
 work in motion and we work 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.260
 often working on on all of 

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:48.430
 centers that we will go up we will go down 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.230
 to take postures 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:52.030
 we will see intentions that are going 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:55.030
 always be focused we are told all the 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:57.220
 time one of the basics it's summit of the 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:59.109
 skull as if we had a son is 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:01.599
 the same down that goes so in the 

00:02:59.109 --> 00:03:03.670
 sense of my it's really all our 

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:05.260
 chakras who are allies and with the 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:07.150
 years an experience maybe and there 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.260
 it's really just a work a 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:12.819
 personal perception 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:14.439
 we have really understanding knowledge 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:16.750
 of our body is instinctively 

00:03:14.439 --> 00:03:18.250
 maybe we'll be moving maybe 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:20.349
 less on the stud maybe more 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:21.819
 go up according to who one 

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:23.019
 had no experience understanding what 

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:25.629
 we know more about the costs 

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:28.660
 more our energies our intuitions so 

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:30.790
 we are a little more rational and it's 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:33.579
 maybe compared to that it takes 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:36.220
 search and see now if you have 

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:37.870
 beginnings of explanations about the fact 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:39.519
 that there is not only one center 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:41.769
 age that may have other 

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:43.989
 through the internal martial arts or 

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:45.760
 externalities do not hesitate to do it to me 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:46.329
 know me it interests me and for in 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.500
 discuss 

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:49.500
 There it is, thanks
