00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
important in card magic also because you

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.450 
important in card magic also because you
want<00:00:21.690> this<00:00:21.840> back<00:00:21.900> later<00:00:22.410> to<00:00:22.619> pick<00:00:22.650> the<00:00:23.010> card<00:00:23.250> in

numbers<00:00:43.590> if<00:00:43.770> I<00:00:43.890> do<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:44.160> other<00:00:44.250> way<00:00:44.460> you<00:00:44.520> can

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
numbers if I do the other way you can

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:50.540 
numbers if I do the other way you can
see<00:00:44.910> them<00:00:46.790> really<00:00:47.790> easy<00:00:48.149> and<00:00:48.510> really<00:00:48.829> fun<00:00:49.829> and

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
see them really easy and really fun and

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.100 
see them really easy and really fun and
really<00:00:50.610> attractive<00:00:52.820> let<00:00:53.820> me<00:00:53.940> do<00:00:54.000> that<00:00:54.149> one

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
really attractive let me do that one

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.139 
really attractive let me do that one
more<00:00:55.140> time<00:00:55.610> it's<00:00:56.610> going<00:00:56.820> to<00:00:56.850> be<00:00:56.940> a<00:00:56.969> little

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
more time it's going to be a little

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:04.910 
more time it's going to be a little
different<00:00:57.450> now<00:00:57.780> I<00:00:59.750> just<00:01:00.750> spread<00:01:01.050> a<00:01:01.260> bit<00:01:03.920> is

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
different now I just spread a bit is

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.650 
different now I just spread a bit is
another<00:01:05.280> way<00:01:06.200> it<00:01:07.200> just<00:01:07.410> seems<00:01:07.800> test<00:01:08.130> but

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:08.660 
another way it just seems test but

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:14.270 
another way it just seems test but
applying<00:01:09.660> the<00:01:09.840> pressure<00:01:10.080> to<00:01:10.440> for<00:01:10.619> me<00:01:12.259> and<00:01:13.280> if

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
applying the pressure to for me and if

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.710 
applying the pressure to for me and if
you<00:01:14.369> did<00:01:14.520> it<00:01:14.640> perfectly<00:01:14.670> you<00:01:15.270> should<00:01:15.479> have

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
you did it perfectly you should have

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.029 
you did it perfectly you should have
like<00:01:15.990> a<00:01:16.160> perfect<00:01:17.160> arc<00:01:18.140> and<00:01:19.140> now<00:01:19.649> I'll<00:01:19.800> teach

00:01:20.029 --> 00:01:20.039 
like a perfect arc and now I'll teach

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:21.859 
like a perfect arc and now I'll teach
you<00:01:20.160> guys<00:01:20.280> how<00:01:20.340> to<00:01:20.490> do<00:01:20.700> it<00:01:20.819> it's<00:01:21.360> basically

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
you guys how to do it it's basically

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.370 
you guys how to do it it's basically
just<00:01:21.990> force<00:01:23.360> so<00:01:24.360> let<00:01:24.690> me<00:01:24.720> teach<00:01:24.959> you<00:01:24.990> how<00:01:25.200> I<00:01:25.229> do

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
just force so let me teach you how I do

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.120 
just force so let me teach you how I do
it<00:01:26.360> first<00:01:27.360> we<00:01:27.509> want<00:01:27.780> your<00:01:27.899> cars<00:01:28.170> to<00:01:28.380> be<00:01:28.500> tilted

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
it first we want your cars to be tilted

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.520 
it first we want your cars to be tilted
like<00:01:29.580> this<00:01:30.800> so<00:01:31.800> tilt<00:01:32.069> it<00:01:32.250> diagonally<00:01:33.380> and<00:01:34.380> they

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
like this so tilt it diagonally and they

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.440 
like this so tilt it diagonally and they
show<00:01:34.679> you<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:34.890> perfect<00:01:35.099> example<00:01:35.660> just<00:01:36.660> like

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450 
show you the perfect example just like

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:44.870 
show you the perfect example just like
this<00:01:39.450> and<00:01:40.789> then<00:01:41.789> you<00:01:43.130> have<00:01:44.130> to<00:01:44.250> put<00:01:44.459> your<00:01:44.550> thumb

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
this and then you have to put your thumb

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.930 
this and then you have to put your thumb
and<00:01:45.090> your<00:01:45.149> fall<00:01:45.920> against<00:01:46.920> partly<00:01:47.429> three<00:01:47.729> to

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:47.940 
and your fall against partly three to

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:51.139 
and your fall against partly three to
two<00:01:48.539> fingers<00:01:48.899> like<00:01:49.229> this<00:01:49.259> and<00:01:49.970> then<00:01:50.970> you<00:01:51.000> have

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
two fingers like this and then you have

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:56.919 
two fingers like this and then you have
to<00:01:51.239> tilt<00:01:51.569> it<00:01:51.720> like<00:01:51.869> this<00:01:52.050> so<00:01:54.860> thumb<00:01:55.860> finger<00:01:56.550> is

00:01:56.919 --> 00:01:56.929 
to tilt it like this so thumb finger is

00:01:56.929 --> 00:02:00.510 
to tilt it like this so thumb finger is
tilted<00:01:58.399> like<00:01:59.399> this

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:00.520 
tilted like this

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.359 
tilted like this
and<00:02:00.729> then<00:02:01.329> you<00:02:01.450> basically<00:02:01.799> take<00:02:02.799> it<00:02:02.979> some<00:02:03.189> and

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:03.369 
and then you basically take it some and

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:06.599 
and then you basically take it some and
then<00:02:04.020> pour<00:02:05.020> lick<00:02:05.289> a<00:02:05.530> lot<00:02:05.859> of<00:02:05.979> force<00:02:06.250> to<00:02:06.310> your

00:02:06.599 --> 00:02:06.609 
then pour lick a lot of force to your

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:09.180 
then pour lick a lot of force to your
thumb<00:02:06.820> and<00:02:07.000> then<00:02:07.149> just<00:02:07.329> spin<00:02:08.110> around<00:02:08.259> just

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.190 
thumb and then just spin around just

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:12.839 
thumb and then just spin around just
like<00:02:09.340> this<00:02:10.739> make<00:02:11.739> sure<00:02:11.769> to<00:02:11.890> apply<00:02:12.280> equal

00:02:12.839 --> 00:02:12.849 
like this make sure to apply equal

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:14.670 
like this make sure to apply equal
pressure<00:02:13.030> so<00:02:13.660> here's<00:02:13.930> an<00:02:14.019> example<00:02:14.050> for<00:02:14.530> you

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
pressure so here's an example for you

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.830 
pressure so here's an example for you
clip<00:02:14.920> pressure<00:02:15.250> over<00:02:16.030> here<00:02:16.180> I'd<00:02:16.420> any

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
clip pressure over here I'd any

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.210 
clip pressure over here I'd any
political<00:02:17.080> pressures<00:02:17.739> with<00:02:18.450> not<00:02:19.450> perfectly

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
political pressures with not perfectly

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:25.039 
political pressures with not perfectly
spaced<00:02:21.220> but<00:02:21.940> over<00:02:22.209> here<00:02:22.360> it<00:02:22.540> is<00:02:23.340> put<00:02:24.340> brettly

00:02:25.039 --> 00:02:25.049 
spaced but over here it is put brettly

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:32.009 
spaced but over here it is put brettly
space<00:02:27.239> so<00:02:28.239> that<00:02:28.269> was<00:02:28.599> my<00:02:29.400> tutorial<00:02:30.400> on<00:02:31.019> the

00:02:32.009 --> 00:02:32.019 
space so that was my tutorial on the

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:35.130 
space so that was my tutorial on the
thundervan<00:02:32.500> and<00:02:33.150> it<00:02:34.150> will<00:02:34.299> take<00:02:34.510> some<00:02:34.690> time<00:02:34.750> to

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140 
thundervan and it will take some time to

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:37.110 
thundervan and it will take some time to
learn<00:02:35.290> it<00:02:35.470> just<00:02:36.040> as<00:02:36.280> my<00:02:36.430> video<00:02:36.700> hope<00:02:36.880> you<00:02:37.000> got

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
learn it just as my video hope you got

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:41.160 
learn it just as my video hope you got
elected<00:02:37.599> I've<00:02:37.930> been<00:02:38.500> criticized<00:02:39.130> by
