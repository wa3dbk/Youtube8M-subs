00:00:04.879 --> 00:00:09.740
 Hello everyone in today's video I want 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:14.759
 make a purchase 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:18.210
 Chinese food I wanted to buy some 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:20.330
 hair accessories and girlfriend she 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.189
 studying chinese and got me 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:25.980
 such as a mini market 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.960
 where you could buy something from 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:34.590
 Chinese food and but naturally I bought 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:37.559
 sweets and want to say that sweets have 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:40.079
 them a little bit others are not in european 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.370
 I understand not because it seems to me 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.649
 our understanding 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.800
 sweets is something that can be right 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.899
 that is, there is a piece of something that is yes in them 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.320
 it seems to me more like self-indulgence 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:57.379
 especially sweet name addicted well and on 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:01:00.570
 taste is not like they taste more Chinese 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:05.309
 it seems a little strange for example 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:12.260
 I know how to call it candy or 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:17.270
 what kind of corn 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:19.830
 such a small corn I did not know 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:23.790
 some sweets taste the first thing 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:25.310
 i smell it baked 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:29.009
 corn 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:32.460
 the smell of boiled sweet corn tastes 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.200
 This corn to sweetish reminds 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:38.520
 some 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:42.259
 cream with vanilla and has 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:46.820
 gelatinous base and so it is soft 

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:46.820
 very unusual sweet salty 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:53.320
 I can not say that she is very strong to me 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:57.270
 like it but you can treat 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:02:00.370
 someone we have a child ate the second 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:03.100
 after a while I saw again asked Dyas 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:08.050
 bit off and did not become that is, well, no matter how 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:10.030
 so that's what's so tasty that you 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:12.420
 bring it to sit and eat these 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:19.000
 corn farmers 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:30.910
 The following is such a box with 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:35.470
 Small inside, I again find it difficult 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:41.620
 how can we call it here from the berries 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:45.780
 blueberries now inside it looks like this 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:50.620
 so there is such a 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:53.640
 gelatinous thing here is a piece of paper 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:56.430
 which can be eaten can be held 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:03:01.870
 she dissolves this 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:03.120
 tricks of this sweet taste but not 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:06.459
 sugary 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:20.260
 I really liked it I bought it here 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:29.610
 such cookies and cereals I filled than 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:29.610
 the house becomes out it is very light 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:42.380
 such as I like popcorn with a cargo here and 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:45.970
 this icing is not sweet but she 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:45.970
 again sweet salty 

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:54.200
 exploring what I like it but 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:59.750
 a little bit in another see this here 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:04:04.670
 Here is sesame such sweetness she 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:07.300
 looks like a piece of sesame but really 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:08.600
 the case here is on thin layers that can 

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:16.070
 tear off 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:22.400
 and eat this fried sesame he soaked me 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:26.030
 I do not know this any or something like 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:29.050
 almonds and sugar syrup to soft Misha 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:31.850
 become not able to tear off exactly 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:35.960
 the point is that it breaks like this 

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:39.980
 all in parts by layers and it is very 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:43.160
 tasty if you see this little thing 

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:44.690
 surely take try here 

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:50.930
 from straight so here is by layers all this 

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:53.300
 it comes off to my taste more to me 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:55.520
 like not fried sesame this fried 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:56.960
 the question of what is fried probably I donâ€™t 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:58.880
