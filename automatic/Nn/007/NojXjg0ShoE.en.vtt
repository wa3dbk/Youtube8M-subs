00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:07.640
 art handling open your eyes and look at 

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:09.860
 This house you have seen hears and now opens more 

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:12.980
 the eyes and look at the drawing of this 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:16.520
 home here you have it you lack something is not 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:17.810
 nice but it lacks volume dimension and 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:19.609
 is that this is a mistake we make 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:23.119
 always when we see something we do not draw 

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:25.490
 its volume and the house has it worth it 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:27.439
 that attentive because we're going to start from 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:29.859
 new and now we are going to draw with 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:29.859
 volume 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.020
 we will start by the side of the house in the 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.570
 another drawing the side was not drawn 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:44.329
 if you look at the dollhouse the 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:48.020
 side of the house looks and the rule is that 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:51.790
 if we see it we draw it 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.790
 and you see the side 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:59.720
 Well, if you've seen it draw what is now 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:02.900
 Roof shape is angled true 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:05.530
 as we put it and the side of the house 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.530
 here 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:10.640
 and the wall ahead 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:25.080
 If you see the house you have to draw everything 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:25.080
 how is the roof and the front 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:40.259
 perfect have you seen it already has volume 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.929
 we already have the basic structure of 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.729
 house you've seen how good now we're going to 

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:47.130
 put the details as are the windows 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:49.530
 and the doors we're going to look at 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.569
 our first drawing you have seen the 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:55.429
 windows and doors are a little 

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:58.200
 basic more so look at the house well 

00:01:55.429 --> 00:02:00.719
 look at the details and you have to 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.800
 move to your drawing is very simple 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:08.050
 look 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:12.430
 we draw the windows around here 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:16.260
 look at the drawing and then at home 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:16.260
 draw the windowsill 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:24.459
 and this horizontal line here 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:28.890
 as the glass looks all black then what 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:28.890
 we painted light black yes 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:44.040
 and the round window 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:44.040
 well we painted it 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:01.840
 what else we see to see let's look 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:03.970
 enough details true 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:07.920
 for the door we will draw the arch 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:07.920
 up and the side 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:14.569
 I look at you as you draw it and 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:14.569
 remember the rule what we see 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:19.890
 we draw it 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:22.280
 and some final touches to finish the 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:22.280
 door 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:25.530
 and up 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:36.380
 let's recap it okay first we see 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:38.210
 the first drawing you've seen here with 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:40.190
 very simple forms lacked a 

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:42.470
 volume and that's what we've done see 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:45.230
 the house and copy its volume and here 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:46.580
 we have the second drawing you see that one 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:48.920
 very easy trick you can put it in 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:51.230
 practice you at home you only owe 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:55.180
 fix is ​​worth nothing hey see you in the 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:55.180
