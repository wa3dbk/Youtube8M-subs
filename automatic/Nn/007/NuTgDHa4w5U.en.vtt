actually pretty you know base hit it

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.730 
actually pretty you know base hit it
exactly<00:01:04.260> right<00:01:04.589> just<00:01:05.189> which<00:01:05.400> China<00:01:05.670> is<00:01:05.939> like

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:06.740 
exactly right just which China is like

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:11.120 
exactly right just which China is like
exactly<00:01:07.740> sorry<00:01:08.369> different<00:01:09.770> we<00:01:10.770> are<00:01:10.799> looking

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
exactly sorry different we are looking

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.770 
exactly sorry different we are looking
at<00:01:11.310> China

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
at China

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.859 
at China
what<00:01:13.350> China<00:01:13.619> will<00:01:13.920> be<00:01:14.040> going<00:01:14.250> through<00:01:14.570> so<00:01:15.570> i

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
what China will be going through so i

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.020 
what China will be going through so i
also<00:01:16.049> tried<00:01:16.380> harder<00:01:16.650> to<00:01:16.680> convince<00:01:16.740> him<00:01:17.340> why

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
also tried harder to convince him why

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.670 
also tried harder to convince him why
I'm<00:01:18.180> in<00:01:18.299> the<00:01:18.360> right<00:01:18.510> choice<00:01:18.810> at<00:01:19.320> the<00:01:19.409> end<00:01:19.590> of

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
I'm in the right choice at the end of

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.490 
I'm in the right choice at the end of
the<00:01:19.890> discussion<00:01:20.760> it<00:01:21.720> told<00:01:21.990> means<00:01:22.170> have<00:01:22.290> bingo

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
the discussion it told means have bingo

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:23.960 
the discussion it told means have bingo
by<00:01:22.979> the<00:01:23.040> way<00:01:23.220> if<00:01:23.280> you<00:01:23.430> want<00:01:23.610> to<00:01:23.700> go<00:01:23.790> back<00:01:23.909> to

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
by the way if you want to go back to

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.510 
by the way if you want to go back to
Princeton<00:01:24.409> let<00:01:25.409> me<00:01:25.530> know<00:01:25.680> and<00:01:26.190> I'll<00:01:26.340> tell

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
Princeton let me know and I'll tell

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:32.870 
Princeton let me know and I'll tell
Shirley<00:01:26.790> tell<00:01:27.030> me<00:01:27.150> and<00:01:29.390> anyway<00:01:30.390> so<00:01:30.899> am<00:01:31.290> I<00:01:32.159> my

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
Shirley tell me and anyway so am I my

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.350 
Shirley tell me and anyway so am I my
relatives<00:01:33.360> in<00:01:33.540> the<00:01:33.659> States<00:01:34.909> still<00:01:35.909> think<00:01:36.210> are

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
relatives in the States still think are

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.420 
relatives in the States still think are
something<00:01:36.750> wrong<00:01:36.930> here<00:01:37.170> with<00:01:37.320> my<00:01:37.440> bro

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
something wrong here with my bro

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.850 
something wrong here with my bro
I'm<00:01:39.430> not<00:01:39.610> joking<00:01:40.140> so<00:01:41.140> why<00:01:41.289> is<00:01:41.320> that<00:01:41.469> a<00:01:41.590> cave

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:41.860 
I'm not joking so why is that a cave

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:46.260 
I'm not joking so why is that a cave
might<00:01:42.100> have<00:01:42.310> a<00:01:42.340> case<00:01:43.799> so<00:01:44.799> I'm<00:01:44.920> a<00:01:45.009> scientist<00:01:45.399> I'm

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:46.270 
might have a case so I'm a scientist I'm

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:49.880 
might have a case so I'm a scientist I'm
a<00:01:46.420> structural<00:01:46.810> wall<00:01:46.929> is<00:01:47.229> what<00:01:47.649> do<00:01:47.740> I<00:01:47.829> do<00:01:48.179> so<00:01:49.179> I

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
a structural wall is what do I do so I

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.270 
a structural wall is what do I do so I
make<00:01:50.890> a<00:01:50.920> living<00:01:51.369> by<00:01:52.360> determining

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
make a living by determining

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.139 
make a living by determining
three-dimensional<00:01:54.280> structures<00:01:54.729> of<00:01:54.939> proteins

00:01:55.139 --> 00:01:55.149 
three-dimensional structures of proteins

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:58.080 
three-dimensional structures of proteins
and<00:01:55.689> macromolecules<00:01:56.579> if<00:01:57.579> you<00:01:57.729> think<00:01:57.939> about

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:58.090 
and macromolecules if you think about

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:01.319 
and macromolecules if you think about
why<00:01:58.569> life<00:01:59.229> those<00:01:59.500> are<00:01:59.740> and<00:02:00.039> if<00:02:00.909> because<00:02:01.299> of

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:01.329 
why life those are and if because of

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:04.289 
why life those are and if because of
macromolecules<00:02:02.079> right<00:02:02.950> so<00:02:03.490> of<00:02:03.729> course<00:02:03.759> at<00:02:04.240> a

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:04.299 
macromolecules right so of course at a

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:06.899 
macromolecules right so of course at a
very<00:02:04.619> bottles<00:02:05.619> because<00:02:05.799> atoms<00:02:06.310> of<00:02:06.490> you<00:02:06.819> know

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:06.909 
very bottles because atoms of you know

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:10.440 
very bottles because atoms of you know
electrons<00:02:07.420> neutrons<00:02:08.670> cells<00:02:09.670> make<00:02:09.940> make<00:02:10.269> up

electrons neutrons cells make make up

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:12.630 
electrons neutrons cells make make up
the<00:02:10.599> very<00:02:11.140> basic<00:02:11.440> and<00:02:11.830> then<00:02:12.069> installs

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
the very basic and then installs

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.500 
the very basic and then installs
proteins<00:02:13.299> are<00:02:13.420> working<00:02:13.780> very<00:02:14.019> busily<00:02:15.010> and<00:02:15.510> my

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
proteins are working very busily and my

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.199 
proteins are working very busily and my
job<00:02:16.780> is<00:02:16.810> to<00:02:17.019> understand<00:02:17.470> the<00:02:18.209> fundamental

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:19.209 
job is to understand the fundamental
