00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:39.979 

I<00:00:37.790> heard<00:00:38.790> about<00:00:38.910> the<00:00:39.090> potential<00:00:39.480> collision<00:00:39.840> on

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
I heard about the potential collision on

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:41.720 
I heard about the potential collision on
the<00:00:40.200> Thursday<00:00:40.530> evening<00:00:40.559> I<00:00:41.040> thought<00:00:41.430> oh<00:00:41.520> that's

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
the Thursday evening I thought oh that's

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.940 
the Thursday evening I thought oh that's
that's<00:00:42.270> odd

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
that's odd

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.400 
that's odd
but<00:00:44.789> let's<00:00:44.940> not<00:00:45.059> panic<00:00:45.270> just<00:00:45.539> yet<00:00:45.660> and<00:00:46.170> then<00:00:46.320> we

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
but let's not panic just yet and then we

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.400 
but let's not panic just yet and then we
got<00:00:46.590> an<00:00:46.829> update<00:00:46.950> on<00:00:47.160> Friday<00:00:47.610> and<00:00:48.600> it<00:00:49.020> looks

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
got an update on Friday and it looks

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:49.880 
got an update on Friday and it looks
worse

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
worse

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.970 
worse
Oh<00:00:49.920> my<00:00:50.730> heart<00:00:50.969> sank

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
Oh my heart sank

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.270 
Oh my heart sank
so<00:00:53.760> we<00:00:54.120> then<00:00:54.539> continued<00:00:55.230> over<00:00:55.920> the<00:00:56.039> weekend

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
so we then continued over the weekend

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.500 
so we then continued over the weekend
and<00:00:56.489> it<00:00:56.579> just<00:00:56.789> you<00:00:57.270> know<00:00:57.350> didn't<00:00:58.350> get<00:00:58.469> better

00:00:59.500 --> 00:00:59.510 
and it just you know didn't get better

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:02.240 
and it just you know didn't get better
there<00:01:00.510> are<00:01:00.600> all<00:01:00.719> kinds<00:01:00.989> of<00:01:01.050> things<00:01:01.289> orbiting

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
there are all kinds of things orbiting

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:02.869 
there are all kinds of things orbiting
the<00:01:02.370> Earth

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
the Earth

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.759 
the Earth
obviously<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:03.809> active<00:01:04.140> spacecraft<00:01:04.619> that

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
obviously the active spacecraft that

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.340 
obviously the active spacecraft that
we're<00:01:04.890> still<00:01:05.040> using<00:01:05.189> but<00:01:06.030> also<00:01:06.350> expired

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
we're still using but also expired

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.410 
we're still using but also expired
spacecraft<00:01:08.010> many<00:01:08.640> of<00:01:08.760> them<00:01:08.880> still<00:01:09.150> in<00:01:09.270> orbit

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
spacecraft many of them still in orbit

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.340 
spacecraft many of them still in orbit
and<00:01:09.659> then<00:01:10.260> there<00:01:10.409> are<00:01:10.580> old<00:01:11.659> parts<00:01:12.659> and<00:01:12.750> then

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
and then there are old parts and then

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.450 
and then there are old parts and then
real<00:01:13.860> debris<00:01:14.369> down<00:01:14.790> to<00:01:15.030> flecks<00:01:15.630> of<00:01:15.750> paint<00:01:16.460> if

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
real debris down to flecks of paint if

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.480 
real debris down to flecks of paint if
you<00:01:17.670> see<00:01:18.000> a<00:01:18.600> piece<00:01:18.930> of<00:01:19.049> debris<00:01:19.259> far<00:01:20.159> enough<00:01:20.310> in

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
you see a piece of debris far enough in

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.179 
you see a piece of debris far enough in
advance<00:01:20.549> you<00:01:21.540> can<00:01:21.570> decide<00:01:22.200> to<00:01:22.229> alter<00:01:22.890> your

looking<00:01:53.670> at<00:01:54.200> late<00:01:55.200> March<00:01:55.409> of<00:01:55.530> 2012<00:01:56.329> we<00:01:57.329> got<00:01:57.360> a

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
looking at late March of 2012 we got a

they knew they were gonna hit it was

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:09.740 
they knew they were gonna hit it was

that they didn't know that they weren't

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
gonna hit so that something we had to be

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:12.809 
gonna hit so that something we had to be
concerned<00:02:12.060> about

00:02:35.439 --> 00:02:38.819 
the basics of the collision avoidance
maneuver<00:02:35.859> is<00:02:36.010> we<00:02:36.879> just<00:02:37.180> use<00:02:37.750> our<00:02:37.930> thrusters<00:02:38.409> to

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:38.829 
maneuver is we just use our thrusters to

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:41.099 
maneuver is we just use our thrusters to
alter<00:02:39.159> our<00:02:39.189> orbits<00:02:39.639> slight<00:02:39.939> amount<00:02:40.239> just<00:02:40.900> to

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:41.109 
alter our orbits slight amount just to

00:02:41.109 --> 00:02:42.869 
alter our orbits slight amount just to
provide<00:02:41.439> a<00:02:41.799> little<00:02:42.069> bit<00:02:42.159> of<00:02:42.280> separation

00:02:42.869 --> 00:02:42.879 
provide a little bit of separation

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:44.910 
provide a little bit of separation
between<00:02:43.060> ourselves<00:02:43.329> and<00:02:43.810> the<00:02:43.900> other<00:02:44.379> piece<00:02:44.739> of

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
between ourselves and the other piece of

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.229 
between ourselves and the other piece of
space<00:02:45.250> debris<00:02:46.950> we<00:02:47.950> haven't<00:02:48.280> ever<00:02:48.370> used<00:02:48.730> the

00:02:49.229 --> 00:02:49.239 
space debris we haven't ever used the

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:52.140 
space debris we haven't ever used the
propulsion<00:02:49.569> system<00:02:50.019> before<00:02:50.290> and<00:02:51.150> using

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
propulsion system before and using

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.420 
propulsion system before and using
something<00:02:52.450> for<00:02:52.810> the<00:02:52.870> first<00:02:53.019> time<00:02:53.340> was<00:02:54.340> going

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
something for the first time was going

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:58.399 
something for the first time was going
to<00:02:54.760> be<00:02:54.879> a<00:02:55.150> major<00:02:55.419> decision<00:02:56.280> we<00:02:57.280> have<00:02:57.459> to<00:02:57.489> decide

00:02:58.399 --> 00:02:58.409 
to be a major decision we have to decide

00:02:58.409 --> 00:03:01.409 
to be a major decision we have to decide
of<00:02:59.409> the<00:03:00.189> two<00:03:00.340> disasters<00:03:00.639> that<00:03:01.060> could<00:03:01.209> happen

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:01.419 
of the two disasters that could happen

00:03:01.419 --> 00:03:04.349 
of the two disasters that could happen
the<00:03:02.069> a<00:03:03.069> collision<00:03:03.549> with<00:03:03.730> another<00:03:04.000> satellite

or<00:03:05.310> fatal<00:03:06.310> failure<00:03:06.819> with<00:03:07.090> a<00:03:07.120> propulsion

system what decision is most defendable

00:03:09.639 --> 00:03:11.970 
system what decision is most defendable
and<00:03:09.909> we<00:03:10.329> concluded<00:03:10.959> that<00:03:11.139> we<00:03:11.500> really<00:03:11.799> needed

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980 
and we concluded that we really needed

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:18.270 
and we concluded that we really needed
to<00:03:12.129> proceed<00:03:12.549> with<00:03:12.879> the<00:03:13.000> burn<00:03:16.769> normally<00:03:17.769> the
