it but all of it seemed less an
attention-grabbing<00:01:06.000> I<00:01:06.210> guess<00:01:06.390> is<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:06.720> word

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
attention-grabbing I guess is the word

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.109 
attention-grabbing I guess is the word
that<00:01:06.930> I<00:01:07.170> would<00:01:07.380> actually<00:01:07.799> use<00:01:07.830> their<00:01:08.700> safe

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
application of what we saw three weeks

comes<00:01:23.820> to<00:01:24.030> what<00:01:24.210> was<00:01:24.330> probably<00:01:24.750> one<00:01:24.900> of<00:01:24.930> those

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
comes to what was probably one of those

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
surprising things of the day the price I

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.090 
surprising things of the day the price I
did<00:01:27.840> think<00:01:28.170> that<00:01:28.200> four<00:01:28.500> hundred<00:01:28.740> ninety<00:01:28.770> nine

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
did think that four hundred ninety nine

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.280 
did think that four hundred ninety nine
dollars<00:01:29.490> was<00:01:29.670> going<00:01:29.820> to<00:01:29.880> be<00:01:29.970> the<00:01:30.090> MSRP<00:01:30.659> for<00:01:30.990> the

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
dollars was going to be the MSRP for the

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.560 
dollars was going to be the MSRP for the
xbox<00:01:31.710> but<00:01:32.220> I<00:01:32.250> did<00:01:32.670> think<00:01:32.700> that<00:01:33.000> Microsoft

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
xbox but I did think that Microsoft

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.719 
xbox but I did think that Microsoft
would<00:01:33.780> actually<00:01:34.200> say<00:01:34.650> hey<00:01:34.920> with<00:01:35.130> the<00:01:35.250> two<00:01:35.460> year

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729
