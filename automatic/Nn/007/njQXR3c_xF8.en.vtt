sometimes<00:00:00.840> you<00:00:01.050> want<00:00:01.290> to<00:00:01.439> work<00:00:01.650> with<00:00:01.680> a

00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:01.860 
sometimes you want to work with a

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:04.820 
sometimes you want to work with a
surface<00:00:02.370> that's<00:00:02.550> already<00:00:02.909> textured<00:00:03.629> and<00:00:03.840> if

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:04.830 
surface that's already textured and if

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:06.950 
surface that's already textured and if
you<00:00:04.950> don't<00:00:05.190> want<00:00:05.460> to<00:00:05.580> buy<00:00:05.790> something<00:00:06.750> like

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
you don't want to buy something like

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.500 
you don't want to buy something like
papyrus<00:00:07.620> paper<00:00:07.859> which<00:00:08.340> obviously<00:00:09.000> has<00:00:09.269> a<00:00:09.300> lot

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
papyrus paper which obviously has a lot

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.870 
papyrus paper which obviously has a lot
of<00:00:09.540> texture<00:00:09.960> or<00:00:10.200> you<00:00:10.349> don't<00:00:10.590> like<00:00:10.950> this<00:00:11.639> very

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
of texture or you don't like this very

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.799 
of texture or you don't like this very
linear<00:00:12.240> texture<00:00:13.019> then<00:00:13.860> you<00:00:14.009> can<00:00:14.250> add<00:00:14.809> texture

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
linear texture then you can add texture

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.560 
linear texture then you can add texture
right<00:00:16.109> onto<00:00:16.590> your<00:00:16.740> surface<00:00:17.010> now<00:00:17.940> you<00:00:18.000> can't<00:00:18.390> do

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
right onto your surface now you can't do

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.420 
right onto your surface now you can't do
this<00:00:18.720> with<00:00:18.960> just<00:00:19.230> paper<00:00:19.529> it<00:00:19.740> has<00:00:19.920> to<00:00:20.100> be<00:00:20.220> some

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
this with just paper it has to be some

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.279 
this with just paper it has to be some
sort<00:00:20.640> of<00:00:20.730> board<00:00:21.060> it<00:00:21.300> has<00:00:21.449> to<00:00:21.630> be<00:00:21.750> you<00:00:21.960> know<00:00:22.080> be<00:00:22.260> a

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
sort of board it has to be you know be a

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.160 
sort of board it has to be you know be a
little<00:00:22.529> bit<00:00:22.650> heavier<00:00:22.949> than<00:00:23.010> paper<00:00:23.369> and<00:00:23.810> a<00:00:24.810> good

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
little bit heavier than paper and a good

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.470 
little bit heavier than paper and a good
sort<00:00:25.470> of<00:00:25.529> adhesive<00:00:25.710> to<00:00:26.340> use<00:00:26.970> would<00:00:27.330> be

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
sort of adhesive to use would be

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.380 
sort of adhesive to use would be
something<00:00:27.810> like<00:00:27.990> a<00:00:28.170> matte<00:00:28.560> medium<00:00:28.859> it<00:00:29.400> dries

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
something like a matte medium it dries

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:31.009 
something like a matte medium it dries
clear

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
clear

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.200 
clear
it<00:00:31.170> says<00:00:31.800> matte<00:00:32.130> so<00:00:32.399> it's<00:00:32.550> going<00:00:32.640> to<00:00:32.730> dry<00:00:32.940> matte

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
it says matte so it's going to dry matte

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.450 
it says matte so it's going to dry matte
they<00:00:33.390> also<00:00:33.540> have<00:00:33.780> gloss<00:00:34.020> medium<00:00:34.530> and<00:00:34.739> it's<00:00:35.340> a

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
they also have gloss medium and it's a

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.540 
they also have gloss medium and it's a
clear<00:00:35.760> acrylic<00:00:36.059> and<00:00:36.390> it<00:00:36.480> works<00:00:36.750> as<00:00:37.020> a

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:37.550 
clear acrylic and it works as a

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:40.819 
clear acrylic and it works as a
essentially<00:00:38.550> as<00:00:38.700> a<00:00:38.730> glue<00:00:39.059> so<00:00:39.989> you<00:00:40.469> put<00:00:40.680> this

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
essentially as a glue so you put this

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.260 
essentially as a glue so you put this
over<00:00:41.100> your<00:00:41.309> surface<00:00:41.820> and<00:00:43.730> you<00:00:44.730> have<00:00:44.940> to<00:00:45.090> work

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
over your surface and you have to work

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.029 
over your surface and you have to work
quite<00:00:45.539> quickly<00:00:48.469> and<00:00:49.469> you're<00:00:49.739> sort<00:00:49.920> of

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
quite quickly and you're sort of

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.459 
quite quickly and you're sort of
glopping<00:00:50.460> it<00:00:50.579> on<00:00:50.700> there's<00:00:51.390> there's<00:00:51.840> no<00:00:52.079> no

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
glopping it on there's there's no no

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.250 
glopping it on there's there's no no
need<00:00:52.649> to<00:00:52.770> be<00:00:52.860> fancy<00:00:53.100> here<00:00:53.520> and<00:00:53.719> I'm<00:00:54.719> going<00:00:55.140> to

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
need to be fancy here and I'm going to

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.650 
need to be fancy here and I'm going to
use<00:00:55.500> tissue<00:00:56.100> paper<00:00:56.280> you<00:00:56.760> can<00:00:57.000> use<00:00:57.030> anything

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
use tissue paper you can use anything

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.880 
use tissue paper you can use anything
else<00:00:58.640> you<00:00:59.640> can<00:00:59.850> use<00:01:00.059> rice<00:01:00.449> paper<00:01:00.899> you<00:01:01.649> could

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
else you can use rice paper you could

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.609 
else you can use rice paper you could
put<00:01:02.100> on<00:01:02.129> some<00:01:02.550> sort<00:01:03.359> of<00:01:03.449> pattern<00:01:03.989> fabric<00:01:04.470> if

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
put on some sort of pattern fabric if

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.820 
put on some sort of pattern fabric if
you<00:01:04.769> wanted<00:01:05.159> and<00:01:06.020> just<00:01:07.020> make<00:01:07.260> sure<00:01:07.290> that<00:01:07.530> your

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
you wanted and just make sure that your

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.700 
you wanted and just make sure that your
paper<00:01:08.070> has<00:01:08.430> rough<00:01:08.760> edy<00:01:09.060> has<00:01:09.479> broken<00:01:10.320> edges

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
paper has rough edy has broken edges

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.620 
paper has rough edy has broken edges
because<00:01:11.159> you<00:01:11.280> don't<00:01:11.460> really<00:01:11.610> want<00:01:11.729> sharp

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
because you don't really want sharp

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.350 
because you don't really want sharp
edges<00:01:13.010> necessarily<00:01:14.010> and<00:01:14.250> you<00:01:14.729> sort<00:01:14.970> of<00:01:15.030> smush

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
edges necessarily and you sort of smush

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.749 
edges necessarily and you sort of smush
it<00:01:15.390> down<00:01:15.750> there<00:01:16.049> and<00:01:16.290> if<00:01:17.280> you're<00:01:17.460> worried

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
it down there and if you're worried

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.780 
it down there and if you're worried
about<00:01:17.820> it<00:01:18.000> staying<00:01:18.979> you<00:01:19.979> might<00:01:20.220> add<00:01:20.430> a<00:01:20.759> little

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
about it staying you might add a little

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.539 
about it staying you might add a little
bit<00:01:21.240> more<00:01:21.680> matte<00:01:22.680> medium<00:01:22.890> on<00:01:23.280> top<00:01:23.900> to<00:01:24.900> just

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:25.549 
bit more matte medium on top to just

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:29.420 
bit more matte medium on top to just
make<00:01:26.549> sure<00:01:26.820> that<00:01:27.060> it<00:01:27.270> it<00:01:28.049> stays<00:01:28.740> down<00:01:29.070> and<00:01:29.369> you

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
make sure that it it stays down and you

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.310 
make sure that it it stays down and you
can<00:01:29.670> work<00:01:29.880> out<00:01:30.030> any<00:01:30.270> air<00:01:30.570> bubbles<00:01:30.600> that<00:01:31.170> you

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
can work out any air bubbles that you

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.770 
can work out any air bubbles that you
end<00:01:31.500> up<00:01:31.680> with<00:01:31.950> and<00:01:32.280> you<00:01:33.090> can<00:01:33.240> smush<00:01:33.570> this

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
end up with and you can smush this

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.480 
end up with and you can smush this
around<00:01:34.200> if<00:01:34.380> you<00:01:34.500> don't<00:01:34.530> happen<00:01:35.040> to<00:01:35.159> you<00:01:35.369> know

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
around if you don't happen to you know

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.100 
around if you don't happen to you know
if<00:01:35.610> you<00:01:35.700> think<00:01:35.939> that's<00:01:36.119> too<00:01:36.240> strong<00:01:36.600> you<00:01:36.869> want

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
if you think that's too strong you want

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.710 
if you think that's too strong you want
to<00:01:37.200> sort<00:01:38.009> of<00:01:38.130> you<00:01:39.030> know<00:01:39.150> you<00:01:39.210> get<00:01:39.450> in<00:01:39.570> there

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
to sort of you know you get in there

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.030 
to sort of you know you get in there
with<00:01:39.840> your<00:01:39.990> hands<00:01:40.320> and<00:01:40.409> you<00:01:40.500> kind<00:01:40.740> of<00:01:40.829> play

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
with your hands and you kind of play

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.639 
with your hands and you kind of play
with<00:01:41.070> it<00:01:41.430> and<00:01:41.640> once<00:01:42.450> this<00:01:42.600> is<00:01:42.840> dry<00:01:43.110> it<00:01:43.170> will<00:01:43.380> dry

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
with it and once this is dry it will dry

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.990 
with it and once this is dry it will dry
white<00:01:43.950> and<00:01:44.509> then<00:01:45.509> you<00:01:45.540> can<00:01:45.810> go<00:01:45.930> over<00:01:45.960> it<00:01:46.409> and

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.000 
white and then you can go over it and

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.819 
white and then you can go over it and
see<00:01:48.000> what<00:01:48.210> happens<00:01:48.630> with<00:01:48.840> it<00:01:48.869> you<00:01:49.409> know<00:01:49.560> as<00:01:49.770> a

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
see what happens with it you know as a

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:52.940 
see what happens with it you know as a
textural<00:01:50.729> surface<00:01:51.270> so<00:01:52.020> you<00:01:52.079> have<00:01:52.439> very

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
textural surface so you have very

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.460 
textural surface so you have very
quickly<00:01:53.280> and<00:01:53.640> very<00:01:53.909> cheaply<00:01:54.390> you<00:01:54.810> know

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
quickly and very cheaply you know

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.219 
quickly and very cheaply you know
created<00:01:56.219> a<00:01:56.369> textural<00:01:56.880> surface<00:01:57.450> that<00:01:57.780> you<00:01:57.930> then

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
created a textural surface that you then

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.860 
created a textural surface that you then
can<00:01:58.259> play
