00:00:09.958 --> 00:00:11.568
 With the arrival of the next generation of consoles, 

00:00:11.568 --> 00:00:14.901
 The games have tried very hard to reach new levels of graphics and gameplay, 

00:00:15.151 --> 00:00:19.669
 So I was not surprised that the sport genre exceeded my expectations with the wave of innovations and changes presented to us. 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.409
 It started with FIFA 15, which contained a more convenient and smooth game system than any previous game, 

00:00:24.801 --> 00:00:28.371
 And continued with the latest basketball experience that is NBA 2K15. 

00:00:38.852 --> 00:00:42.442
 Many people have defined NBA 2K15 as the most simulation game 

00:00:42.442 --> 00:00:45.569
 Than a typical sport game, and I must agree with them. 

00:00:45.749 --> 00:00:49.608
 Add a lot of aspects to the game that allow it to function as a simulation game 

00:00:49.608 --> 00:00:54.478
 Which is critically affected by the statistics and scores given to each player from each team in the league. 

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:03.489
 Already at first glance the NBA 2K15 looks more real than any other sports game, 

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:07.840
 With amazing visuals that manages to run on average PC gamers at 60 FPS, 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:09.900
 Without any restrictions and problems while playing. 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:12.891
 As you continue to play you are guaranteed an addictive experience, 

00:01:12.891 --> 00:01:14.851
 Using most of the thanks he offers you. 

00:01:17.591 --> 00:01:22.025
 The first model to be seen in the game is called 2KTV and is not exactly part of the game, 

00:01:22.025 --> 00:01:25.334
 But a special series that prepares to entertain the owners of the game only, 

00:01:25.604 --> 00:01:27.867
 That is, you can see the series only through the game. 

00:01:28.277 --> 00:01:30.978
 The series lets you see interviews with NBA players, 

00:01:30.978 --> 00:01:34.337
 And especially the series takes selected segments of gamers from all over the world 

00:01:34.337 --> 00:01:37.847
 Who have done amazing things while playing and are presenting them in the series. 

00:01:42.749 --> 00:01:44.490
 The second mod is your career mode, 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.572
 Which by the way, in my opinion, is also the most invested and best in the game. 

00:01:47.822 --> 00:01:52.298
 You start with a player you build according to your wishes with a lot of building options. It is important to note, 

00:01:52.628 --> 00:01:54.415
 And then experience a series of Cut-Scenes 

00:01:54.415 --> 00:01:57.632
 Which accompany every stage of your career as an actor struggling to enter 

00:01:57.632 --> 00:02:00.212
 To the NBA as a successful basketball player. 

00:02:09.836 --> 00:02:12.314
 You will experience ups and downs of your player mainly 

00:02:12.314 --> 00:02:17.408
 Because of a scoring system that examines every move you make in the game in an exaggerated and too rigid way in my opinion. 

00:02:17.848 --> 00:02:21.578
 But in the end you will always try to improve and increase the levels of the game. 

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:33.165
 As we say at the beginning there are many aspects of the game that make it a simulation game as well 

00:02:33.165 --> 00:02:36.291
 Like the MyGM or MyLeague moderators that let you control 

00:02:36.291 --> 00:02:41.419
 For everything behind the scenes from negotiating contracts to food prices in your stadium, 

00:02:41.689 --> 00:02:45.249
 Or more important things like league length or even a roster of teams. 

00:02:49.661 --> 00:02:53.686
 And of course 2K knows how to pamper to the end because it does not end here, oh no. 

00:02:53.936 --> 00:02:56.273
 The game also has special modifiers for Multiplayer, 

00:02:56.273 --> 00:02:59.486
 Like the Online Leagues moderator that functions as a match against other players, 

00:02:59.876 --> 00:03:03.722
 Or the MyTeam model, which is a sort of copy of the Ultimate Team mode from FIFA games 

00:03:03.942 --> 00:03:08.122
 Where you build your own team in the form of cards that contain players, coaches and more ... 

00:03:13.416 --> 00:03:17.142
 There is also a form called MyPark that can be accessed with the player you created 

00:03:17.142 --> 00:03:20.532
 For Maude career where you will choose one of three different communities, 

00:03:20.842 --> 00:03:23.616
 With each community giving you a bonus in a certain ability. 

00:03:23.896 --> 00:03:27.964
 In the game you can be in games of 2 by 2 or 3 by 3 against other players, 

00:03:28.184 --> 00:03:31.714
 Each game will give you a score that will raise you in the honor system of the mod. 

00:03:38.313 --> 00:03:40.686
 As you can see, will not bore you in the game, 

00:03:40.686 --> 00:03:45.655
 Because there's always something different to do, but that's not the main thing for which you listen to me now. 

00:03:45.915 --> 00:03:49.510
 It all comes down to the gameplay system and is well built. 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:53.008
 First of all, I'll calm you down and say that it's amazingly built. 

00:03:53.118 --> 00:03:56.354
 The artificial intelligence of each member of your group is quite high 

00:03:56.354 --> 00:04:00.057
 But it is not higher than the artificial intelligence level of members of the opposing team 

00:04:00.407 --> 00:04:03.772
 In terms of quick play, defense, and strategy, which is perfectly understandable. 

00:04:04.172 --> 00:04:07.838
 This is because your player will need to reach full functionality 

00:04:07.838 --> 00:04:11.798
 In every way to help your team rise above the opposing team. 

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:21.187
 The game also helps you as a single player out of a group of NPC's 

00:04:21.187 --> 00:04:24.550
 Because you have added a gauge underneath your player what shows your odds 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:27.631
 To score by your position on the field, and the strength of the shot, 

00:04:28.021 --> 00:04:31.421
 Which even as I said already shows the drop simulation element. 

00:04:36.795 --> 00:04:38.919
 It is disappointing to say that the only thing that destroys the game, 

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:41.711
 They are simply the servers on which the Multiplayer modes are sitting 

00:04:41.881 --> 00:04:44.040
 Because they are broken in a very problematic way. 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:48.355
 It happened to me not once that just in the middle of a game, I was turned against my will to the main screen 

00:04:48.595 --> 00:04:50.830
 Because things like Ping and Server collapsed. 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:54.720
 Lags are very hard to attack after a counterattack, do not you think? 

00:05:02.262 --> 00:05:06.513
 In conclusion, the NBA 2K15 feels like the game involved with the basketball world 

00:05:06.513 --> 00:05:08.134
 In the best way to date, 

00:05:08.444 --> 00:05:11.896
 In other words, the way in which half of them feel is as authentic as possible, 

00:05:12.226 --> 00:05:15.564
 Even between half and half there are interviews near the basketball court, 

00:05:15.874 --> 00:05:18.317
 And you can only praise the commentaries of the broadcasters 

00:05:18.567 --> 00:05:21.434
 Or the fact that we can play as Maccabi Tel Aviv. 

00:05:21.794 --> 00:05:25.314
 The NBA 2K15 certainly deserves the award for the sport of the year, 

00:05:25.504 --> 00:05:28.704
 And in this review he gets the score 9.2. 

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:33.717
 So this is for this coverage, 

00:05:33.867 --> 00:05:35.809
