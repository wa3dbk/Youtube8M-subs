the whole head so what I'm doing now is

00:01:43.849 --> 00:01:45.999 
the whole head so what I'm doing now is
I<00:01:44.119> just<00:01:44.329> went<00:01:44.539> around<00:01:44.599> the<00:01:44.929> hair<00:01:45.229> and<00:01:45.469> I'm

I just went around the hair and I'm

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:48.819 
I just went around the hair and I'm
shaping<00:01:46.729> it<00:01:47.119> I<00:01:47.360> see<00:01:47.929> this<00:01:48.079> a<00:01:48.140> lot<00:01:48.439> that<00:01:48.679> people

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:48.829 
shaping it I see this a lot that people

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:51.160 
shaping it I see this a lot that people
just<00:01:49.159> take<00:01:49.429> these<00:01:49.640> sections<00:01:50.179> and<00:01:50.420> they<00:01:50.929> just

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:51.170 
just take these sections and they just

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:54.369 
just take these sections and they just
cut<00:01:51.409> straight<00:01:51.799> across<00:01:51.860> like<00:01:52.729> this<00:01:53.030> I<00:01:53.390> don't

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:54.379 
cut straight across like this I don't

00:01:54.379 --> 00:01:56.050 
cut straight across like this I don't
recommend<00:01:54.770> that<00:01:55.039> with<00:01:55.310> her<00:01:55.459> texture<00:01:55.849> because

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
recommend that with her texture because

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:57.609 
recommend that with her texture because
you're<00:01:56.179> gonna<00:01:56.270> want<00:01:56.539> to<00:01:56.629> solid<00:01:57.140> brunt<00:01:57.379> clay

00:01:57.609 --> 00:01:57.619 
you're gonna want to solid brunt clay

00:01:57.619 --> 00:01:59.649 
you're gonna want to solid brunt clay
because<00:01:58.099> then<00:01:58.280> it<00:01:58.369> looks<00:01:58.399> like<00:01:58.759> a<00:01:58.789> broom<00:01:59.149> I

00:01:59.649 --> 00:01:59.659 
because then it looks like a broom I

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:03.550 
because then it looks like a broom I
recommend<00:02:00.530> cutting<00:02:00.739> it<00:02:01.009> into<00:02:01.429> like<00:02:01.640> this<00:02:02.560> so

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
recommend cutting it into like this so

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.770 
recommend cutting it into like this so
that<00:02:03.590> it<00:02:04.069> falls<00:02:04.340> like<00:02:04.640> in<00:02:04.819> a<00:02:04.849> really<00:02:05.299> natural

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:05.780 
that it falls like in a really natural

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:07.890 
that it falls like in a really natural
way<00:02:06.229> and<00:02:06.289> it<00:02:06.500> doesn't<00:02:06.829> get<00:02:06.950> so<00:02:07.189> poofy

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:07.900 
way and it doesn't get so poofy

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:13.750 
way and it doesn't get so poofy
the<00:02:08.020> bottom

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.520
