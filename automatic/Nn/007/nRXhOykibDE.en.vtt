00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:06.820 
the low temperature fusing of the glass

so<00:02:07.820> we're<00:02:07.940> using<00:02:08.149> so<00:02:08.569> you're<00:02:08.780> using<00:02:09.020> glass<00:02:09.440> as

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:09.770 
so we're using so you're using glass as

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:12.309 
so we're using so you're using glass as

I<00:02:12.409> gave<00:02:13.249> workshops<00:02:13.790> where<00:02:14.030> I<00:02:14.060> call<00:02:14.390> this<00:02:14.629> the

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
I gave workshops where I call this the

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.160 
I gave workshops where I call this the
principle<00:02:15.560> of<00:02:15.799> reactive<00:02:16.489> aggregate<00:02:17.209> by<00:02:17.870> that

principle of reactive aggregate by that

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.559 
principle of reactive aggregate by that
I<00:02:18.409> mean<00:02:18.650> to<00:02:18.709> communicate<00:02:19.400> the<00:02:19.579> idea<00:02:19.909> that

00:02:20.559 --> 00:02:20.569 
I mean to communicate the idea that

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:23.080 
I mean to communicate the idea that
during<00:02:20.959> forming<00:02:21.530> the<00:02:21.739> class<00:02:21.980> acts<00:02:22.340> as<00:02:22.700> a<00:02:22.730> grog

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
during forming the class acts as a grog

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.759 
during forming the class acts as a grog
and<00:02:23.480> reduces<00:02:24.170> the<00:02:24.349> chance<00:02:24.620> of<00:02:25.180> drying<00:02:26.180> cracks

00:02:26.759 --> 00:02:26.769

while at high temperatures the glass

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:31.569 
while at high temperatures the glass
