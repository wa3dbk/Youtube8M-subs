00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:09.080
 recently lennik favorite films want energy efficiency in the netherlands 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:12.499
 increase along those roads 

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:14.569
 consume less 

00:00:14.569 --> 00:00:16.369
 reuse 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:19.550
 m making the energy requirement more sustainable 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:23.440
 we do this by combining the supply and demand of energy at the local level 

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:25.230
 to link 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.169
 for example through manure from cows 

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:30.749
 heat that remains from a paper mill 

00:00:30.749 --> 00:00:34.960
 or to convert the slip from the sewage treatment plant as efficiently as possible into 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:36.100
 energy 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.920
 this energy is then used to supply electricity and 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.340
 the local heating of a residential area 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:47.100
 essent developed bolt and exploits projects that meet local demand 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.100
 be able to fill in energy efficiently 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:56.580
 the pension payment in each cow 

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:00.010
 because the rest is fixed by the margin that the college 

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.620
 at the moment that plant remains come from how should this text 

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:05.830
 that which 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:09.570
 stays in the well and if you're sure the bacteria will stay a little active yet 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.760
 always gas production and that is biogas and that biogas that is precisely the guests 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.760
 to use it in the residential areas 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:20.200
 turnover and profit 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.180
 the cow dung is fermented 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:24.500
 this creates the biogas 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.570
 the biogas is fed through a pipeline to a 2 megawatt cogeneration as john 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:30.500
 transported in the residential area 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:34.710
 biogas and activities and heat are generated at this station 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:38.910
 this provides all houses with heat for heating and hot 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:41.910
 tap water 

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:52.749
 We are at the companies juice in Maastricht 

00:01:52.749 --> 00:01:56.919
 the company currently makes paper production one of three in the 

00:01:56.919 --> 00:01:58.100
 thousand 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:59.170
 Down here 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:01.000
 the municipality has dementia 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.450
 set that goal 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:03.920
 at the bottom of 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.950
 and asylum 2 reports the fifth suspect have paired 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.369
 companies that have mastered themselves in places that do have a possibility 

00:02:11.369 --> 00:02:12.250
 not here yet 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:15.250
 Also have somewhere else told Bastian customers to choose 

00:02:16.029 --> 00:02:18.690
 by placing flue gas heat exchanger 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:23.270
 The paper mill can provide 5 megawatts of heat to a temperature of 90 degrees Celsius 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:24.479
 to deliver 

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:28.449
 the heat goes by pipeline but the heat and cold power plant are essential 

00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:32.639
 welcome and preferably otherwise this in her apartment distributes the new 

00:02:32.639 --> 00:02:35.639
 city â€‹â€‹office and shops and homes 

00:02:37.929 --> 00:02:40.049
 development of the new city office 

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:41.419
 the bronze officials 

00:02:41.419 --> 00:02:44.419
 it is developing number of stores on the ground floor 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:49.319
 after projects have been abandoned and the leader is yes within walking distance of the 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:50.699
 sapphire factory 

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:54.229
 And so having allocated bone there is no head rinner to make eventually 

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:57.239
 has made that natural along has already led to a successful project 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:02:58.979
 where one comes from this city 

00:02:58.979 --> 00:03:02.969
 be heated and cooled if necessary with the remains of the demonstration 

00:03:10.969 --> 00:03:14.519
 of course there were already eleven boys in countless waste streams all over the world 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:15.570
 not nearly like that anymore 

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:17.199
 because it is sewage sludge 

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:21.090
 to have that gives a break down and then we can have very hard 

00:03:21.089 --> 00:03:22.259
 pull out 

00:03:22.259 --> 00:03:25.539
 and that biogases is the same before the telegraph 

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:27.840
 by fermenting sludge 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.349
 on biogas free 

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:33.369
 the engine clogged as a guest and thus generates heat and electricity 

00:03:33.869 --> 00:03:37.119
 on the beaches he for example the engines that run the treatment plant 

00:03:37.119 --> 00:03:38.089
 drive 

00:03:38.089 --> 00:03:41.089
 the heat is used to heat the houses 

00:03:42.439 --> 00:03:44.669
 percent searched 

00:03:44.669 --> 00:03:47.890
 the supplier of sustainable own riders in the sea 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:51.450
 and of course also know that water purification is capable of that energy 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:53.879
 to produce the municipality of Apeldoorn 

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:58.710
 really wanted to design neighborhoods in a sustainable way and a new ball 

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:00.480
 and in that way little play is needed
