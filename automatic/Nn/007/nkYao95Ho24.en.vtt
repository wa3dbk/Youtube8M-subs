 Virtual Reality The word virtual reality is used by someone in the game and movie world 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:36.379

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:39.390
 You may have heard the word "Repe" and "Repe repeat" in Ofu, but ar and abbreviation 

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:45.960
 Augmented reality technology that is often 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:51.899
 For users by fusing real environment and fictional environment created by computer 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:54.110
 More information than the actual sense of pressure in one of the objectives is to say the sun 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.110

 Digital content x held at Odaiba's Japan Truck Future Museum last week 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:08.130

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:08.130
 It has been utilized examples backlash of many ar technology 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:20.080
 I wonder if it would be smooth mounted behind the car of suicide Fuji , and with that camera yes 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:20.740
 Candidate of the car Ushuaia each and you me be projected in the back seat to process the video second race 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:25.240
 Is it 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:29.340

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:29.340
 You will get a move like a cheer extended 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:36.900
 ni nare 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:38.159
 Had me I had a person enters here 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:44.860
 I think that I can use 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:51.120
 There die or immediately understand Ya smoked or live the all seat properly even there anyone who at the time now 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:55.290
 But I'm feeling is also Papiko be three F 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:58.620
 This is an experiment to say that ar has been in the laboratory until now 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:02.910
 Well computer on special high mark 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:07.530
 Cg character comes up when there is a camera or pointing up 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:15.270
 Or Toka but those things I was often but I can be seen from this exhibition 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:18.610
 Reality of it usual really clean and help in the middle of the night Toka use useful in life Toka such a 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:18.730
 It means that you have entered the practical area at the stage 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:22.150
 Four 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:24.060
 The reality of the meeting system of the swordsman is rising 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:28.470
 Well people move 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:31.830
 It's the lowest time to get on the vehicle using the frequency 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:36.930
 Well that's because there's no longer it's moving 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:38.430
 Is in it also, such as say let's do that other rich floating energy ar 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:42.980
 What effect do you bring 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:49.250
 Well there is really a wide spread of main office

00:02:55.159 --> 00:03:01.360
 It seems that it is near the time when you can get information with a more natural sense 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:17.239
 To put it simply, virtual reality is all about reality, though it is cremation 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:23.970
 Although it writes, it is thought that this org face and the reality expanded in part to the reality and the real thing 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:30.540
 It looks like the image of a woman waving at the back of a bird thin that appeared in vtr is blues 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:32.690
 It is that there is reality in part as it was projected as a picture in the back seat of 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:32.690
