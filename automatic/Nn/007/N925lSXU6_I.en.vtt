00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:16.480 
highlight a table let's say I'm pleased
and<00:00:14.120> I<00:00:14.719> can<00:00:14.870> create<00:00:14.990> a<00:00:15.139> foreman<00:00:15.559> you<00:00:16.400> know

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:16.490 
and I can create a foreman you know

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:18.609 
and I can create a foreman you know
where<00:00:16.939> as<00:00:17.119> the<00:00:17.330> tables<00:00:17.689> maybe<00:00:17.900> the<00:00:18.140> back<00:00:18.349> end

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:18.619 
where as the tables maybe the back end

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:20.710 
where as the tables maybe the back end
the<00:00:19.039> form<00:00:19.310> is<00:00:19.460> sort<00:00:19.640> of<00:00:19.669> the<00:00:19.820> front<00:00:20.090> end<00:00:20.300> of

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:20.720 
the form is sort of the front end of

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:22.509 
the form is sort of the front end of
access<00:00:21.169> and<00:00:21.200> this<00:00:21.890> just<00:00:22.099> gives<00:00:22.160> me<00:00:22.369> an

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:22.519 
access and this just gives me an

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:27.370 
access and this just gives me an
interface<00:00:23.289> so<00:00:24.289> if<00:00:24.349> i<00:00:24.439> go<00:00:24.470> to<00:00:24.590> view<00:00:24.920> here<00:00:25.160> um<00:00:26.380> go

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:27.380 
interface so if i go to view here um go

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:29.679 
interface so if i go to view here um go
to<00:00:27.439> form<00:00:27.769> view<00:00:28.179> it's<00:00:29.179> kind<00:00:29.359> of<00:00:29.449> a<00:00:29.539> nice

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:29.689 
to form view it's kind of a nice

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:31.960 
to form view it's kind of a nice
convenient<00:00:30.230> way<00:00:30.529> to<00:00:30.560> access<00:00:31.369> the<00:00:31.550> database

and if I hide the bar upper you would be

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:38.110 
and if I hide the bar upper you would be
able<00:00:34.970> to<00:00:35.059> see<00:00:35.239> everything<00:00:36.670> without<00:00:37.670> a<00:00:37.790> second

if I wanted to just by clicking here and

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:53.320 
if I wanted to just by clicking here and
bring<00:00:52.040> that<00:00:52.070> back<00:00:52.400> down<00:00:52.580> and<00:00:52.879> bring<00:00:53.030> that<00:00:53.059> back

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:53.330 
bring that back down and bring that back

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:56.920 
bring that back down and bring that back
down<00:00:53.510> no<00:00:53.869> I<00:00:53.900> won't<00:00:54.170> save<00:00:54.379> any<00:00:54.589> changes<00:00:54.619> and<00:00:55.930> if

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:56.930 
down no I won't save any changes and if

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:01.170 
down no I won't save any changes and if
I<00:00:57.290> were<00:00:57.470> to<00:00:57.680> create<00:00:57.949> a<00:00:58.070> form<00:00:58.430> in<00:00:59.739> design<00:01:00.739> view

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:01.180 
I were to create a form in design view

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:04.539 
I were to create a form in design view
then<00:01:02.180> I<00:01:02.360> could<00:01:02.540> make<00:01:02.720> one<00:01:02.900> from<00:01:03.019> scratch<00:01:03.549> or

00:01:04.539 --> 00:01:04.549 
then I could make one from scratch or

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:06.880 
then I could make one from scratch or
use<00:01:05.180> it<00:01:05.360> I<00:01:05.540> could<00:01:05.810> use<00:01:05.960> the<00:01:05.990> form<00:01:06.320> wizard<00:01:06.500> here

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:06.890 
use it I could use the form wizard here

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:08.980 
use it I could use the form wizard here
and<00:01:07.130> then<00:01:07.369> I<00:01:07.670> could<00:01:07.729> take<00:01:08.000> it<00:01:08.030> into<00:01:08.299> design

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:08.990 
and then I could take it into design

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:12.240 
and then I could take it into design
view<00:01:09.189> if<00:01:10.189> I<00:01:10.399> wanted<00:01:10.640> to<00:01:10.789> get<00:01:10.909> more<00:01:11.149> specific

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:12.250 
view if I wanted to get more specific

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:14.560 
view if I wanted to get more specific
you<00:01:13.250> know<00:01:13.340> there's<00:01:13.700> a<00:01:13.759> lot<00:01:13.969> we<00:01:14.000> could<00:01:14.240> do<00:01:14.420> as

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:14.570 
you know there's a lot we could do as

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:17.130 
you know there's a lot we could do as
far<00:01:14.750> setting<00:01:15.140> form<00:01:15.380> properties<00:01:15.920> and<00:01:16.460> values

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:17.140 
far setting form properties and values

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:20.260 
far setting form properties and values
and<00:01:18.140> calculations<00:01:18.859> and<00:01:19.189> fonts<00:01:19.670> and<00:01:19.789> all<00:01:19.909> kinds

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.270 
and calculations and fonts and all kinds

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.599 
and calculations and fonts and all kinds
of<00:01:20.329> things<00:01:20.390> in<00:01:20.750> graphics<00:01:21.229> you<00:01:22.039> can<00:01:22.070> really

00:01:22.599 --> 00:01:22.609 
of things in graphics you can really

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:25.090 
of things in graphics you can really
spend<00:01:23.240> a<00:01:23.299> lot<00:01:23.600> of<00:01:23.630> time<00:01:23.810> just<00:01:24.020> on<00:01:24.499> form<00:01:24.770> design

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.100 
spend a lot of time just on form design

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.580 
spend a lot of time just on form design
and<00:01:25.310> maybe<00:01:25.700> at<00:01:26.479> a<00:01:26.600> later<00:01:26.630> time<00:01:26.899> when<00:01:27.259> we<00:01:27.380> get

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:27.590 
and maybe at a later time when we get

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:29.440 
and maybe at a later time when we get
more<00:01:27.710> time<00:01:27.770> we<00:01:28.159> will<00:01:28.340> do<00:01:28.549> that<00:01:28.759> but<00:01:28.999> for<00:01:29.179> now<00:01:29.390> we

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:29.450 
more time we will do that but for now we

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:34.720 
more time we will do that but for now we
just<00:01:29.749> don't<00:01:30.200> have<00:01:30.380> time<00:01:30.619> for<00:01:30.890> that

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:34.730 

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:36.460 

in<00:01:35.210> addition<00:01:35.390> to<00:01:35.600> creating<00:01:35.720> a<00:01:35.960> simple<00:01:36.140> form

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:36.470 
in addition to creating a simple form

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:37.780 
in addition to creating a simple form
with<00:01:36.560> the<00:01:36.620> wizard<00:01:36.920> you<00:01:37.040> can<00:01:37.130> create<00:01:37.250> a<00:01:37.340> subform

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:37.790 
with the wizard you can create a subform

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:38.920 
with the wizard you can create a subform
so<00:01:38.030> I'm<00:01:38.090> going<00:01:38.240> to<00:01:38.270> build<00:01:38.480> one<00:01:38.600> on<00:01:38.720> the<00:01:38.840> in

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:38.930 
so I'm going to build one on the in

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:40.030 
so I'm going to build one on the in
place<00:01:39.170> get<00:01:39.440> where<00:01:39.620> I'm<00:01:39.710> going<00:01:39.770> to<00:01:39.920> go<00:01:39.980> to

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:40.040 
place get where I'm going to go to

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:43.420 
place get where I'm going to go to
create<00:01:40.370> and<00:01:41.950> I'm<00:01:42.950> going<00:01:43.160> to<00:01:43.190> go<00:01:43.280> ahead<00:01:43.310> and

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:43.430 
create and I'm going to go ahead and

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:45.130 
create and I'm going to go ahead and
create<00:01:43.640> a<00:01:43.760> form<00:01:44.030> here<00:01:44.240> with<00:01:44.630> the<00:01:44.750> form<00:01:44.960> wizard

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:45.140 
create a form here with the form wizard

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.970 
create a form here with the form wizard
and<00:01:46.510> not<00:01:47.510> want<00:01:47.660> to<00:01:47.750> add<00:01:47.840> a<00:01:47.870> subform<00:01:48.470> so<00:01:48.710> to<00:01:48.770> do

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:48.980 
and not want to add a subform so to do

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:50.970 
and not want to add a subform so to do
that<00:01:49.010> I<00:01:49.160> want<00:01:49.400> to<00:01:49.490> pull<00:01:49.670> it<00:01:49.820> into<00:01:49.970> design<00:01:50.540> view

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:50.980 
that I want to pull it into design view

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:54.820 
that I want to pull it into design view
I'm<00:01:51.980> going<00:01:52.130> to<00:01:52.220> go<00:01:52.310> down<00:01:52.460> here<00:01:52.490> and<00:01:53.680> remove<00:01:54.680> the

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:54.830 
I'm going to go down here and remove the
