00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
of these and you could just make it

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.990 
of these and you could just make it
smaller<00:00:33.630> you<00:00:33.780> could<00:00:34.079> just<00:00:34.320> make<00:00:34.530> it<00:00:34.850> whoops

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
smaller you could just make it whoops

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.540 
smaller you could just make it whoops
you<00:00:36.540> could<00:00:36.719> just<00:00:36.899> make<00:00:37.050> it<00:00:37.079> only<00:00:37.890> you<00:00:38.430> know

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
three but it holds 12 cans per little

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.139 
three but it holds 12 cans per little
column<00:00:44.700> and<00:00:45.649> it's<00:00:46.649> just<00:00:46.890> made<00:00:47.100> with<00:00:47.250> MDF<00:00:47.730> and

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
column and it's just made with MDF and

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.950 
column and it's just made with MDF and
it's<00:00:48.930> he<00:00:49.620> measured<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.190> size<00:00:50.700> of<00:00:50.879> a<00:00:51.000> can<00:00:51.270> and

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
it's he measured the size of a can and

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.900 
it's he measured the size of a can and
then<00:00:52.140> put<00:00:52.289> these<00:00:52.469> little<00:00:52.739> spacers<00:00:53.370> on<00:00:53.520> to<00:00:53.699> hold

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
then put these little spacers on to hold

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.470 
then put these little spacers on to hold
the<00:00:54.120> cans<00:00:54.390> so<00:00:55.199> that<00:00:55.680> when<00:00:56.460> you<00:00:56.550> put<00:00:56.789> the<00:00:56.940> cannon

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
the cans so that when you put the cannon

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.189 
the cans so that when you put the cannon
at<00:00:57.660> the<00:00:57.690> top<00:00:58.370> it'll<00:00:59.370> slide<00:01:00.000> down<00:01:00.329> here<00:01:00.750> to<00:01:01.079> the

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
at the top it'll slide down here to the

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.290 
at the top it'll slide down here to the
bottom<00:01:01.379> and<00:01:01.710> then<00:01:02.219> you<00:01:02.370> just<00:01:02.609> always<00:01:02.850> take

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
bottom and then you just always take

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:11.390 
bottom and then you just always take
from<00:01:04.140> the<00:01:04.470> bottom<00:01:06.170> and<00:01:08.630> you<00:01:09.630> can<00:01:10.130> make<00:01:11.130> sure

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
from the bottom and you can make sure

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.830 
from the bottom and you can make sure
that<00:01:11.430> it's<00:01:11.700> rotated<00:01:12.270> that<00:01:12.390> way

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
that it's rotated that way

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.080 
that it's rotated that way
and<00:01:13.200> as<00:01:13.680> you<00:01:13.830> saw<00:01:14.010> it's<00:01:14.220> kind<00:01:14.430> of<00:01:14.490> hard<00:01:14.760> to<00:01:14.850> yank

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
and as you saw it's kind of hard to yank

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.640 
and as you saw it's kind of hard to yank
that's<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:15.479> only<00:01:15.750> problem<00:01:15.930> I<00:01:16.259> found<00:01:16.439> with

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
that's the only problem I found with

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.910 
that's the only problem I found with
this<00:01:16.890> whole<00:01:17.189> unit<00:01:17.640> is<00:01:17.820> that<00:01:18.540> once<00:01:19.259> there's<00:01:19.500> 12

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
this whole unit is that once there's 12

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.130 
this whole unit is that once there's 12
cans<00:01:20.250> in<00:01:20.460> there<00:01:20.610> you<00:01:21.240> have<00:01:21.420> to<00:01:21.540> really<00:01:21.780> pull<00:01:22.110> on

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
cans in there you have to really pull on

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.270 
cans in there you have to really pull on
them<00:01:22.619> but<00:01:23.009> that<00:01:23.250> also<00:01:23.610> keeps<00:01:25.070> little<00:01:26.070> kids

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
them but that also keeps little kids

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.490 
them but that also keeps little kids
from<00:01:26.490> pulling<00:01:26.820> them<00:01:26.939> out<00:01:27.030> and<00:01:27.500> rearranging

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
from pulling them out and rearranging

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.120 
from pulling them out and rearranging
themselves<00:01:29.509> inexpensive<00:01:30.590> didn't<00:01:31.590> take<00:01:31.799> long

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
themselves inexpensive didn't take long

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:39.910 
themselves inexpensive didn't take long
made<00:01:32.579> with<00:01:32.820> scraps<00:01:33.210> and<00:01:34.189> holds<00:01:35.210> 12<00:01:36.590> cans<00:01:37.590> per

made with scraps and holds 12 cans per
little<00:01:41.570> column<00:01:42.570> and<00:01:42.810> you<00:01:43.229> can<00:01:43.259> make<00:01:43.680> them

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
little column and you can make them

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.530 
little column and you can make them
deeper<00:01:44.250> if<00:01:44.430> you<00:01:44.460> wanted<00:01:44.909> we<00:01:45.060> just<00:01:45.240> went<00:01:45.390> with

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.020 
it on the walls in the closet you would
then<00:02:20.409> be<00:02:20.470> able<00:02:20.620> still<00:02:21.040> to<00:02:21.220> hang<00:02:21.430> your<00:02:21.610> clothes

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
then be able still to hang your clothes

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.270 
then be able still to hang your clothes
in<00:02:22.360> the<00:02:22.480> closet<00:02:22.629> if<00:02:23.110> you<00:02:23.650> did<00:02:23.829> this<00:02:23.980> behind

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
in the closet if you did this behind

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.050 
in the closet if you did this behind
your<00:02:24.930> clothes<00:02:26.189> like<00:02:27.189> coats<00:02:27.459> and<00:02:27.700> that<00:02:27.790> kind<00:02:28.000> of

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
your clothes like coats and that kind of

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.839 
your clothes like coats and that kind of
thing<00:02:28.269> so<00:02:28.569> I<00:02:28.810> think<00:02:29.140> that<00:02:29.530> would<00:02:29.680> be<00:02:29.849> something

00:02:30.839 --> 00:02:30.849 
thing so I think that would be something

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:32.550 
thing so I think that would be something
that<00:02:30.939> would<00:02:31.000> be<00:02:31.120> fairly<00:02:31.359> like<00:02:32.200> if<00:02:32.349> you<00:02:32.439> just
