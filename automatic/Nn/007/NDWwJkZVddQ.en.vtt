it's<00:00:00.960> good<00:00:01.110> moving<00:00:01.350> oh<00:00:01.909> we've<00:00:02.909> got<00:00:02.939> lightning

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:03.330 
it's good moving oh we've got lightning

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:04.999 
it's good moving oh we've got lightning
and<00:00:03.720> I'm<00:00:03.780> guessing<00:00:04.170> we<00:00:04.230> can<00:00:04.380> use<00:00:04.500> lightning<00:00:04.710> on

00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:05.009 
and I'm guessing we can use lightning on

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:12.730 
and I'm guessing we can use lightning on
them<00:00:05.160> considering<00:00:05.670> that<00:00:05.790> they've<00:00:06.000> made<00:00:06.029> of

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:12.740 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:16.070 

and<00:00:13.740> they're<00:00:13.980> can<00:00:14.160> use<00:00:14.280> like<00:00:15.080> lightning

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
and they're can use like lightning

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.830 
and they're can use like lightning

what's that oh cool lightning rod likely

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:38.240 
what's that oh cool lightning rod likely
right<00:03:33.270> lightly<00:03:33.570> right<00:03:33.720> like<00:03:34.080> around<00:03:35.600> here<00:03:37.250> do
