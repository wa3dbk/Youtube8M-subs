the green and yellow and we have the
blue<00:00:21.450> and<00:00:21.630> red<00:00:21.720> at<00:00:22.230> the<00:00:22.290> end<00:00:22.649> there<00:00:22.880> what<00:00:23.880> I'll

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
blue and red at the end there what I'll

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.580 
blue and red at the end there what I'll
do<00:00:24.119> is<00:00:24.300> just<00:00:24.329> get<00:00:24.720> rid<00:00:24.840> of<00:00:24.899> a<00:00:24.989> couple<00:00:25.290> of<00:00:25.470> these

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
do is just get rid of a couple of these

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.109 
do is just get rid of a couple of these
and<00:00:25.829> talk<00:00:26.130> you<00:00:26.309> through<00:00:26.369> the<00:00:26.579> features<00:00:26.759> which

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
and talk you through the features which

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.359 
and talk you through the features which
of<00:00:27.270> course<00:00:27.300> are<00:00:27.750> identical<00:00:28.590> for<00:00:28.619> all<00:00:29.009> three

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
of course are identical for all three

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.700 
of course are identical for all three
colors<00:00:29.809> so<00:00:30.809> the<00:00:30.930> first<00:00:31.169> thing<00:00:31.380> I<00:00:31.500> want<00:00:31.649> to

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
colors so the first thing I want to

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.770 
colors so the first thing I want to
highlight<00:00:31.890> is<00:00:32.309> that<00:00:32.340> we<00:00:32.669> have<00:00:33.090> made<00:00:33.390> these

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
highlight is that we have made these

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.870 
highlight is that we have made these
cool<00:00:34.080> boxes<00:00:34.500> to<00:00:34.710> comply<00:00:35.070> with<00:00:35.370> the<00:00:35.550> latest

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
cool boxes to comply with the latest

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.510 
cool boxes to comply with the latest
European<00:00:36.170> legislations<00:00:37.170> on<00:00:37.340> performance<00:00:38.340> and

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
European legislations on performance and

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.850 
European legislations on performance and
efficiency<00:00:39.000> how<00:00:39.930> we've<00:00:40.140> done<00:00:40.350> that<00:00:40.500> is<00:00:40.680> by

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
efficiency how we've done that is by

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.910 
efficiency how we've done that is by
using<00:00:41.100> a<00:00:41.250> very<00:00:41.460> good<00:00:41.880> quality<00:00:42.270> PU<00:00:43.260> insulation

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
using a very good quality PU insulation

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.710 
using a very good quality PU insulation
on<00:00:44.100> the<00:00:44.130> inside<00:00:44.280> we've<00:00:45.180> added<00:00:45.420> extra

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:45.720 
on the inside we've added extra

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:48.530 
on the inside we've added extra
insulation<00:00:46.710> in<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:47.220> lid<00:00:47.579> compartment<00:00:48.270> of<00:00:48.390> the

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:48.540 
insulation in the lid compartment of the

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:50.690 
insulation in the lid compartment of the
cool<00:00:48.720> boxes<00:00:49.110> and<00:00:49.290> we<00:00:49.950> use<00:00:50.190> the<00:00:50.430> latest

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
cool boxes and we use the latest

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.420 
cool boxes and we use the latest
technology<00:00:51.450> in<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:51.960> cool<00:00:52.230> box<00:00:52.470> motors<00:00:53.160> as

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
technology in the cool box motors as

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.640 
technology in the cool box motors as
well<00:00:53.640> to<00:00:53.850> ensure<00:00:53.970> as<00:00:54.390> I<00:00:54.840> say<00:00:55.020> there<00:00:55.200> that<00:00:55.260> these

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:55.650 
well to ensure as I say there that these

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:58.040 
well to ensure as I say there that these
are<00:00:55.860> powerful<00:00:56.250> but<00:00:56.940> still<00:00:57.180> very<00:00:57.210> efficient<00:00:57.900> as

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
are powerful but still very efficient as

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.650 
are powerful but still very efficient as
well<00:00:58.280> so<00:00:59.280> in<00:00:59.489> terms<00:00:59.730> of<00:00:59.940> features<00:01:00.120> I<00:01:00.329> think<00:01:00.600> the

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
well so in terms of features I think the

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.090 
well so in terms of features I think the
first<00:01:00.899> thing<00:01:00.989> to<00:01:01.170> talk<00:01:01.350> about<00:01:01.380> with<00:01:01.829> these

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
first thing to talk about with these

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.579 
first thing to talk about with these
cool<00:01:02.820> boxes<00:01:03.239> is<00:01:03.420> that<00:01:03.780> they<00:01:03.989> have<00:01:04.199> two

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
cool boxes is that they have two

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.010 
cool boxes is that they have two
different<00:01:04.949> uses<00:01:05.549> first<00:01:06.330> of<00:01:06.479> all<00:01:06.570> it<00:01:06.750> can<00:01:06.960> be

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
different uses first of all it can be

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.800 
different uses first of all it can be
used<00:01:07.380> as<00:01:07.620> a<00:01:07.650> cool<00:01:07.950> box<00:01:08.190> and<00:01:08.400> it<00:01:08.460> will<00:01:08.520> keep<00:01:08.810> any

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
used as a cool box and it will keep any

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.270 
used as a cool box and it will keep any
of<00:01:10.050> the<00:01:10.140> items<00:01:10.290> within<00:01:10.680> here

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
of the items within here

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.740 
of the items within here
cooler<00:01:11.790> than<00:01:12.060> the<00:01:12.150> ambient<00:01:12.570> temperature

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
cooler than the ambient temperature

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.580 
cooler than the ambient temperature
outside<00:01:13.260> by<00:01:13.770> 18<00:01:14.280> to<00:01:14.460> 25<00:01:14.940> degrees<00:01:15.360> but<00:01:16.290> it<00:01:16.440> also

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
outside by 18 to 25 degrees but it also

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.760 
outside by 18 to 25 degrees but it also
has<00:01:17.130> a<00:01:17.159> hot<00:01:17.640> function<00:01:18.180> so<00:01:18.690> what<00:01:19.110> we<00:01:19.229> can<00:01:19.440> do<00:01:19.590> is

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
has a hot function so what we can do is

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.550 
has a hot function so what we can do is
switch<00:01:20.310> this<00:01:20.549> to<00:01:20.880> that<00:01:21.090> function<00:01:21.360> to<00:01:22.049> enable

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
switch this to that function to enable

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.530 
switch this to that function to enable
you<00:01:22.710> to<00:01:22.740> keep<00:01:23.040> things<00:01:23.340> in<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:23.850> cool<00:01:24.060> box<00:01:24.270> a

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
you to keep things in the cool box a

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.230 
you to keep things in the cool box a
little<00:01:25.110> bit<00:01:25.200> warmer<00:01:25.620> between<00:01:26.130> 50<00:01:26.580> to<00:01:26.820> 60

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
little bit warmer between 50 to 60

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.719 
little bit warmer between 50 to 60
degrees<00:01:27.740> we'll<00:01:28.740> show<00:01:28.860> you<00:01:28.890> how<00:01:29.040> to<00:01:29.159> do<00:01:29.430> that<00:01:29.580> in

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
degrees we'll show you how to do that in

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.310 
degrees we'll show you how to do that in
detail<00:01:29.909> shortly<00:01:30.600> but<00:01:30.720> I<00:01:30.780> just<00:01:30.960> want<00:01:31.110> to<00:01:31.170> talk

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
detail shortly but I just want to talk

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.280 
detail shortly but I just want to talk
you<00:01:31.500> through<00:01:31.650> some<00:01:31.740> of<00:01:32.159> the<00:01:32.340> other<00:01:32.369> features

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:33.290 
you through some of the other features

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:36.380 
you through some of the other features
firstly<00:01:34.290> the<00:01:34.770> actual<00:01:35.280> design<00:01:35.670> of<00:01:35.940> the<00:01:36.180> cool

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
firstly the actual design of the cool

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:37.550 
firstly the actual design of the cool
box<00:01:36.540> you<00:01:36.720> can<00:01:36.869> see<00:01:36.990> is<00:01:37.170> a<00:01:37.200> little<00:01:37.470> bit

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
box you can see is a little bit

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.020 
box you can see is a little bit
different<00:01:37.950> it's<00:01:38.070> very<00:01:38.130> modern<00:01:38.610> and<00:01:38.760> sleek

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
different it's very modern and sleek

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.600 
different it's very modern and sleek
designed<00:01:39.630> and<00:01:39.869> this<00:01:40.110> is<00:01:40.350> certainly<00:01:40.799> not<00:01:41.460> an

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
designed and this is certainly not an

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.230 
designed and this is certainly not an
off-the-shelf<00:01:42.240> product<00:01:42.659> that<00:01:42.780> is<00:01:42.930> literally

something a little bit different and a

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.649 
something a little bit different and a
little<00:01:49.710> bit<00:01:49.799> more<00:01:50.010> special<00:01:50.640> than<00:01:50.850> a<00:01:51.119> standard

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
little bit more special than a standard

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.830 
little bit more special than a standard
square<00:01:51.990> cool<00:01:52.439> box<00:01:52.850> also<00:01:53.850> what<00:01:54.119> we<00:01:54.270> have<00:01:54.450> here

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
square cool box also what we have here

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.230 
square cool box also what we have here
is<00:01:54.990> an<00:01:55.140> adjustable<00:01:55.560> handle<00:01:55.799> on<00:01:56.159> top<00:01:56.490> that<00:01:56.909> will

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
is an adjustable handle on top that will

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.420 
is an adjustable handle on top that will
fold<00:01:58.080> flat<00:01:58.500> so<00:01:58.740> it's<00:01:58.860> not<00:01:58.950> going<00:01:59.100> to<00:01:59.159> take<00:01:59.280> up

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
fold flat so it's not going to take up

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.070 
fold flat so it's not going to take up
much<00:01:59.580> room<00:01:59.640> and<00:02:00.030> of<00:02:00.119> course<00:02:00.330> keep<00:02:00.570> out<00:02:00.780> the<00:02:00.930> way

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:01.080 
much room and of course keep out the way

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:02.630 
much room and of course keep out the way
so<00:02:01.350> it's<00:02:01.439> not<00:02:01.500> going<00:02:01.680> to<00:02:01.740> be<00:02:01.830> easily<00:02:02.130> damaged

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
so it's not going to be easily damaged

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.730 
so it's not going to be easily damaged
when<00:02:03.360> it<00:02:03.390> is<00:02:03.570> in<00:02:03.750> use<00:02:03.930> all<00:02:04.170> we<00:02:04.259> have<00:02:04.409> to<00:02:04.500> do<00:02:04.619> is

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
when it is in use all we have to do is

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.310 
when it is in use all we have to do is
simply<00:02:05.009> pull<00:02:05.759> up<00:02:05.909> and<00:02:06.119> what<00:02:06.960> you<00:02:07.049> will<00:02:07.170> then

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:05.519 
you so we have a standard divider here

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:08.990 
you so we have a standard divider here
which<00:03:06.329> has<00:03:06.510> slots<00:03:06.900> into<00:03:07.319> grooves<00:03:07.620> inside<00:03:08.340> the

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
which has slots into grooves inside the

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.319 
which has slots into grooves inside the
core<00:03:09.299> box<00:03:09.480> just<00:03:10.079> to<00:03:10.230> separate<00:03:10.680> the<00:03:10.829> two<00:03:11.010> areas

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:11.329 
core box just to separate the two areas

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:13.610 
core box just to separate the two areas
if<00:03:12.329> you<00:03:12.420> don't<00:03:12.660> want<00:03:12.870> to<00:03:12.989> use<00:03:13.140> this<00:03:13.349> though<00:03:13.500> and

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
if you don't want to use this though and

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.170 
if you don't want to use this though and
you<00:03:13.680> want<00:03:13.829> to<00:03:13.890> keep<00:03:14.010> things<00:03:14.220> even<00:03:14.640> cooler<00:03:14.880> and

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
you want to keep things even cooler and

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.870 
you want to keep things even cooler and
save<00:03:15.450> them<00:03:15.690> what<00:03:15.840> we<00:03:15.959> can<00:03:16.200> do<00:03:16.380> is<00:03:16.530> fill<00:03:17.459> up<00:03:17.489> the

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880 
save them what we can do is fill up the

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:20.900 
save them what we can do is fill up the
ACE<00:03:18.150> block<00:03:18.630> holder<00:03:19.230> here<00:03:19.590> with<00:03:19.859> water<00:03:20.100> pop<00:03:20.760> it

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
ACE block holder here with water pop it

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:22.610 
ACE block holder here with water pop it
in<00:03:21.060> the<00:03:21.359> freezer<00:03:21.750> that<00:03:22.260> will<00:03:22.380> obviously

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
in the freezer that will obviously

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:24.890 
in the freezer that will obviously
freeze<00:03:23.069> the<00:03:23.220> water<00:03:23.340> and<00:03:23.760> again<00:03:24.359> this<00:03:24.660> will

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
freeze the water and again this will

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:26.930 
freeze the water and again this will
then<00:03:25.049> just<00:03:25.380> replace<00:03:25.680> your<00:03:26.100> standard<00:03:26.400> divider

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
then just replace your standard divider

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.569 
then just replace your standard divider
and<00:03:27.450> will<00:03:27.720> slide<00:03:27.989> down<00:03:28.019> into<00:03:28.470> position<00:03:28.950> as<00:03:29.519> I

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:29.579 
and will slide down into position as I

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:31.910 
and will slide down into position as I
say<00:03:29.880> dividing<00:03:30.660> the<00:03:30.900> cool<00:03:31.260> box<00:03:31.410> into<00:03:31.769> two

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
say dividing the cool box into two

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:33.590 
say dividing the cool box into two
separate<00:03:32.250> areas<00:03:32.400> but<00:03:32.670> also<00:03:32.760> keeping<00:03:33.269> things

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:33.600 
separate areas but also keeping things

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:37.580 
separate areas but also keeping things
that<00:03:33.840> little<00:03:34.109> bit<00:03:34.230> cooler<00:03:34.530> inside<00:03:36.230> as<00:03:37.230> I<00:03:37.290> said

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
that little bit cooler inside as I said

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:39.110 
that little bit cooler inside as I said
earlier<00:03:37.980> on<00:03:38.130> there<00:03:38.340> we<00:03:38.489> have<00:03:38.670> extra

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
earlier on there we have extra

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.090 
earlier on there we have extra
insulation<00:03:39.569> within<00:03:40.079> the<00:03:40.319> lid<00:03:40.560> and<00:03:40.799> all<00:03:40.980> the

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:41.100 
insulation within the lid and all the

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:42.860 
insulation within the lid and all the
way<00:03:41.190> around<00:03:41.370> the<00:03:41.670> inside<00:03:42.030> is<00:03:42.239> a<00:03:42.269> good<00:03:42.600> quality

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
way around the inside is a good quality

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:45.680 
way around the inside is a good quality
PU<00:03:43.470> insulation<00:03:44.160> so<00:03:44.370> as<00:03:44.670> I<00:03:44.790> said<00:03:45.000> performance

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:45.690 
PU insulation so as I said performance

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:49.370 
PU insulation so as I said performance
wise<00:03:45.989> is<00:03:46.290> very<00:03:46.680> very<00:03:46.859> good<00:03:47.069> here<00:03:48.049> if<00:03:49.049> I<00:03:49.200> just

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:49.380 
wise is very very good here if I just

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:52.490 
wise is very very good here if I just
spin<00:03:49.739> the<00:03:50.010> cool<00:03:50.340> box<00:03:50.579> around<00:03:51.030> to<00:03:51.930> the<00:03:52.260> back

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
spin the cool box around to the back

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.590 
spin the cool box around to the back
what<00:03:52.859> I<00:03:52.889> want<00:03:53.130> to<00:03:53.250> just<00:03:53.459> highlight<00:03:53.639> is<00:03:53.910> this<00:03:54.569> a

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:54.600 
what I want to just highlight is this a

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.990 
what I want to just highlight is this a
hidden<00:03:54.900> panel<00:03:55.260> at<00:03:55.530> the<00:03:55.560> back<00:03:55.799> here<00:03:56.100> which<00:03:56.730> we

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
hidden panel at the back here which we

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.390 
hidden panel at the back here which we
can<00:03:57.150> open<00:03:57.450> up<00:03:57.510> and<00:03:57.690> give<00:03:58.019> access<00:03:58.200> to<00:03:58.560> where<00:03:59.160> all

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 
can open up and give access to where all

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:02.330 
can open up and give access to where all
the<00:03:59.639> function<00:04:00.209> buttons<00:04:00.569> are<00:04:00.840> so<00:04:01.769> inside<00:04:02.130> if<00:04:02.280> I

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 
the function buttons are so inside if I

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:04.039 
the function buttons are so inside if I
just<00:04:02.489> talk<00:04:02.670> you<00:04:02.819> through<00:04:02.970> you<00:04:03.150> have<00:04:03.299> a<00:04:03.510> Max<00:04:03.900> and

00:04:04.039 --> 00:04:04.049 
just talk you through you have a Max and

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:06.920 
just talk you through you have a Max and
equal<00:04:04.769> switch<00:04:05.519> on<00:04:05.760> the<00:04:06.000> right-hand<00:04:06.540> side<00:04:06.750> of

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
equal switch on the right-hand side of

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:08.780 
equal switch on the right-hand side of
the<00:04:07.139> cool<00:04:07.290> box<00:04:07.470> here<00:04:07.739> now<00:04:08.250> what<00:04:08.459> that<00:04:08.489> will

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
the cool box here now what that will

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:10.250 
the cool box here now what that will
allow<00:04:08.910> is<00:04:09.269> when<00:04:09.540> it's<00:04:09.690> in<00:04:09.840> its<00:04:10.019> maximum

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:10.260 
allow is when it's in its maximum

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.319 
allow is when it's in its maximum
position<00:04:10.919> that<00:04:11.069> will<00:04:11.190> allow<00:04:11.459> you<00:04:12.000> to<00:04:12.030> keep

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:12.329 
position that will allow you to keep

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:15.319 
position that will allow you to keep
things<00:04:12.599> cool<00:04:12.900> between<00:04:13.169> the<00:04:13.470> 8<00:04:13.739> 18<00:04:14.730> and<00:04:14.910> 25

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:15.329 
things cool between the 8 18 and 25

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:17.810 
things cool between the 8 18 and 25
degrees<00:04:16.039> less<00:04:17.039> than<00:04:17.070> the<00:04:17.430> ambient

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:17.820 
degrees less than the ambient

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:20.120 
degrees less than the ambient
temperature<00:04:18.000> and<00:04:18.780> there<00:04:19.320> is<00:04:19.410> an<00:04:19.590> equal<00:04:19.950> mode

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.130 
temperature and there is an equal mode

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:21.529 
temperature and there is an equal mode
on<00:04:20.310> there<00:04:20.519> so<00:04:20.669> it's<00:04:20.789> not<00:04:20.820> going<00:04:21.030> to<00:04:21.090> use<00:04:21.239> quite

00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:21.539 
on there so it's not going to use quite

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:23.690 
on there so it's not going to use quite
as<00:04:21.690> much<00:04:21.870> power<00:04:22.140> and<00:04:22.380> obviously<00:04:23.190> it<00:04:23.520> won't

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:23.700 
as much power and obviously it won't

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:25.310 
as much power and obviously it won't
then<00:04:23.789> keep<00:04:24.210> things<00:04:24.450> quite<00:04:24.720> as<00:04:24.840> cold<00:04:25.140> inside

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:25.320 
then keep things quite as cold inside

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:27.260 
then keep things quite as cold inside
but<00:04:25.919> still<00:04:26.010> certainly<00:04:26.430> keep<00:04:26.669> them<00:04:26.789> cool

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270 
but still certainly keep them cool

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:30.750 
but still certainly keep them cool
we<00:04:28.270> then<00:04:28.480> have<00:04:28.930> a<00:04:29.230> hot<00:04:29.500> and<00:04:29.740> cold<00:04:29.830> switch<00:04:30.520> here

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:30.760 
we then have a hot and cold switch here

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:32.250 
we then have a hot and cold switch here
as<00:04:30.940> I<00:04:30.970> mentioned<00:04:31.060> earlier<00:04:31.630> on<00:04:31.750> for<00:04:31.990> the<00:04:32.080> dual

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:32.260 
as I mentioned earlier on for the dual

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.260 
as I mentioned earlier on for the dual
functionality<00:04:32.710> and<00:04:33.070> this<00:04:33.190> is<00:04:33.310> also<00:04:33.520> where

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:34.270 
functionality and this is also where

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:37.170 
functionality and this is also where
your<00:04:34.420> off<00:04:34.600> switches<00:04:34.990> as<00:04:35.380> well<00:04:35.670> we<00:04:36.670> then<00:04:36.850> have

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:37.180 
your off switches as well we then have

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:41.580 
your off switches as well we then have
the<00:04:37.450> DC<00:04:38.020> or<00:04:38.230> AC<00:04:38.970> area<00:04:39.970> or<00:04:40.630> switch<00:04:41.020> here<00:04:41.380> rather

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:41.590 
the DC or AC area or switch here rather

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:43.920 
the DC or AC area or switch here rather
so<00:04:42.160> again<00:04:42.430> no<00:04:42.730> matter<00:04:42.970> at<00:04:43.150> which<00:04:43.270> power<00:04:43.570> source

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:43.930 
so again no matter at which power source

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:45.600 
so again no matter at which power source
you're<00:04:44.110> using<00:04:44.140> whether<00:04:44.650> it's<00:04:44.830> a<00:04:44.890> 12<00:04:45.220> volt<00:04:45.400> or

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:45.610 
you're using whether it's a 12 volt or

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:48.060 
you're using whether it's a 12 volt or
the<00:04:45.730> 230<00:04:46.180> volt<00:04:46.480> you<00:04:46.900> can<00:04:47.050> simply<00:04:47.440> switch<00:04:47.710> this

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:48.070 
the 230 volt you can simply switch this

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:50.910 
the 230 volt you can simply switch this
to<00:04:48.730> what<00:04:49.240> you<00:04:49.480> require<00:04:49.840> and<00:04:50.260> of<00:04:50.500> course<00:04:50.740> we

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:50.920 
to what you require and of course we

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:52.860 
to what you require and of course we
then<00:04:51.070> have<00:04:51.310> the<00:04:51.610> two<00:04:51.880> plugged<00:04:52.210> pipes<00:04:52.420> for<00:04:52.720> the

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:52.870 
then have the two plugged pipes for the

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:55.110 
then have the two plugged pipes for the
adapters<00:04:53.320> for<00:04:53.350> the<00:04:53.650> inside<00:04:54.130> on<00:04:54.370> here<00:04:54.730> as<00:04:54.940> well

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:55.120 
adapters for the inside on here as well

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:57.300 
adapters for the inside on here as well
now<00:04:55.330> what<00:04:56.290> you<00:04:56.380> will<00:04:56.500> find<00:04:56.770> is<00:04:56.920> that<00:04:56.950> there<00:04:57.190> is

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:57.310 
now what you will find is that there is

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:00.180 
now what you will find is that there is
a<00:04:57.340> green<00:04:57.700> light<00:04:57.880> and<00:04:58.030> a<00:04:58.480> red<00:04:58.840> light<00:04:59.170> LED<00:04:59.800> on<00:05:00.010> the

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:00.190 
a green light and a red light LED on the

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:02.160 
a green light and a red light LED on the
inside<00:05:00.520> here<00:05:00.760> as<00:05:00.880> well<00:05:01.060> so<00:05:01.600> when<00:05:01.750> it's<00:05:01.900> green

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:02.170 
inside here as well so when it's green

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:03.810 
inside here as well so when it's green
it's<00:05:02.230> just<00:05:02.680> showing<00:05:02.800> you<00:05:02.980> that<00:05:03.100> it's<00:05:03.280> running

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:03.820 
it's just showing you that it's running

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:05.790 
it's just showing you that it's running
perfectly<00:05:04.480> and<00:05:04.780> what<00:05:05.080> you<00:05:05.170> will<00:05:05.320> also<00:05:05.500> find

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:05.800 
perfectly and what you will also find

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:08.250 
perfectly and what you will also find
then<00:05:06.070> is<00:05:06.400> the<00:05:06.670> red<00:05:06.910> LED<00:05:07.540> light<00:05:07.720> will<00:05:07.900> come<00:05:08.080> on

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:08.260 
then is the red LED light will come on

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.770 
then is the red LED light will come on
to<00:05:08.800> highlight<00:05:09.220> that<00:05:09.430> your<00:05:09.580> car<00:05:09.880> battery<00:05:10.090> might

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:10.780 
to highlight that your car battery might

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:12.540 
to highlight that your car battery might
be<00:05:10.960> getting<00:05:11.230> a<00:05:11.350> little<00:05:11.470> bit<00:05:11.620> low<00:05:11.890> so<00:05:12.130> it's<00:05:12.370> a

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:12.550 
be getting a little bit low so it's a

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:14.850 
be getting a little bit low so it's a
low<00:05:12.760> battery<00:05:13.150> indicator<00:05:13.330> and<00:05:14.050> that<00:05:14.530> would<00:05:14.710> be

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:14.860 
low battery indicator and that would be
