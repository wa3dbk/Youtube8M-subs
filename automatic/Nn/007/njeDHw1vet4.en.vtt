00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:02.220 
no from a car point of view we have

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.599 
no from a car point of view we have
various<00:00:03.090> new<00:00:03.300> parts<00:00:03.659> for<00:00:04.310> Barcelona<00:00:05.310> we<00:00:05.520> are

00:00:05.599 --> 00:00:05.609 
various new parts for Barcelona we are

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:07.130 
various new parts for Barcelona we are
able<00:00:05.759> to<00:00:05.940> get<00:00:06.150> on<00:00:06.299> and<00:00:06.450> manufacture<00:00:06.990> those

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.140 
able to get on and manufacture those

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.310 
able to get on and manufacture those
without<00:00:07.589> having<00:00:08.099> the<00:00:08.189> car<00:00:08.400> here<00:00:08.970> and<00:00:09.150> it's<00:00:09.990> if

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
without having the car here and it's if

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.560 
without having the car here and it's if
we<00:00:10.500> still<00:00:10.740> had<00:00:10.769> enough<00:00:11.070> time<00:00:11.309> to<00:00:11.370> pre<00:00:12.330> fit

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
we still had enough time to pre fit

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.020 
we still had enough time to pre fit
those<00:00:12.750> parts<00:00:13.170> before<00:00:13.380> we<00:00:13.679> depart<00:00:14.490> Barcelona

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
those parts before we depart Barcelona

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.109 
those parts before we depart Barcelona
we<00:00:15.150> had<00:00:15.299> a<00:00:15.540> three-week<00:00:16.289> gap<00:00:16.529> had<00:00:16.740> it<00:00:16.859> been<00:00:17.010> a

00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:17.119 
we had a three-week gap had it been a

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:19.040 
we had a three-week gap had it been a
two-week<00:00:18.119> gap<00:00:18.359> then<00:00:18.570> it<00:00:18.690> would<00:00:18.779> have<00:00:18.900> been<00:00:18.990> a

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
two-week gap then it would have been a

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.679 
two-week gap then it would have been a
bit<00:00:19.199> tight<00:00:19.470> but<00:00:19.740> luckily<00:00:20.670> the<00:00:21.000> the<00:00:21.359> calendar

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
bit tight but luckily the the calendar

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.710 
bit tight but luckily the the calendar
worked<00:00:21.869> out<00:00:22.109> okay<00:00:22.880> I'd<00:00:23.880> be<00:00:24.180> happier<00:00:24.539> if<00:00:24.539> you

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
worked out okay I'd be happier if you

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:25.960 
worked out okay I'd be happier if you
managed<00:00:24.990> to<00:00:25.050> convert<00:00:25.320> more<00:00:25.560> of<00:00:25.619> the

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:25.970 
managed to convert more of the

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:28.279 
managed to convert more of the
qualifying<00:00:26.970> results<00:00:27.119> into<00:00:27.539> race<00:00:27.810> results

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
qualifying results into race results

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.250 
qualifying results into race results
obviously<00:00:29.000> it's<00:00:30.000> been<00:00:30.179> frustrating<00:00:30.539> days

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
obviously it's been frustrating days

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.180 
obviously it's been frustrating days
have<00:00:31.500> been<00:00:31.579> frustrating<00:00:34.100> apart<00:00:35.100> from

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
have been frustrating apart from

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.030 
have been frustrating apart from
Malaysia<00:00:35.520> obviously<00:00:36.110> but<00:00:37.110> it's<00:00:37.590> encouraging

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
Malaysia obviously but it's encouraging

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.319 
Malaysia obviously but it's encouraging
to<00:00:38.100> have<00:00:38.219> a<00:00:38.280> good<00:00:38.700> start<00:00:38.910> to<00:00:39.149> season

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
to have a good start to season

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.619 
to have a good start to season
performance<00:00:39.870> wise<00:00:40.550> just<00:00:41.550> as<00:00:41.670> last<00:00:41.910> year<00:00:42.210> it's

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
performance wise just as last year it's

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.240 
performance wise just as last year it's
going<00:00:42.809> to<00:00:42.870> be<00:00:42.960> about<00:00:43.050> a<00:00:43.170> development<00:00:43.739> race<00:00:43.890> and

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
going to be about a development race and

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.880 
going to be about a development race and
in<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:44.820> challenge<00:00:45.180> for<00:00:45.300> us<00:00:45.390> now<00:00:45.690> is<00:00:45.719> to<00:00:46.200> make

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
in the challenge for us now is to make

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.650 
in the challenge for us now is to make
sure<00:00:46.920> that<00:00:47.309> we<00:00:47.430> try<00:00:47.879> to<00:00:47.940> keep<00:00:48.120> the<00:00:48.210> performance

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
sure that we try to keep the performance

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.619 
sure that we try to keep the performance
right<00:00:48.840> at<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:49.079> front<00:00:49.230> end<00:00:49.879> well<00:00:50.879> in<00:00:51.239> our<00:00:51.570> case

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
right at the front end well in our case

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.360 
right at the front end well in our case
we<00:00:51.870> have<00:00:52.199> a<00:00:52.230> new<00:00:52.860> floor<00:00:53.550> new<00:00:53.820> top<00:00:54.329> body<00:00:55.370> because

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
we have a new floor new top body because

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.779 
we have a new floor new top body because
I<00:00:56.460> think<00:00:57.289> traditionally<00:00:58.289> the<00:00:58.500> first<00:00:59.039> European

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
I think traditionally the first European

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.299 
I think traditionally the first European
season<00:01:00.239> is<00:01:00.359> always<00:01:00.539> a<00:01:00.690> lot<00:01:01.289> of<00:01:01.410> updates<00:01:01.770> for<00:01:02.070> a

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
season is always a lot of updates for a

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.359 
season is always a lot of updates for a
lot<00:01:02.760> of<00:01:02.789> people<00:01:02.940> along<00:01:03.390> the<00:01:03.510> grid<00:01:03.719> so<00:01:04.159> I'm<00:01:05.159> sure

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
lot of people along the grid so I'm sure

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.219 
lot of people along the grid so I'm sure
we'll<00:01:05.549> see<00:01:05.610> a<00:01:05.790> lot<00:01:06.210> of<00:01:06.270> new<00:01:06.479> parts<00:01:06.900> and<00:01:07.110> it's

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
we'll see a lot of new parts and it's

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.710 
we'll see a lot of new parts and it's
obviously<00:01:07.590> how<00:01:08.340> we<00:01:08.400> perform<00:01:08.760> relative<00:01:09.630> to

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
obviously how we perform relative to

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.560 
obviously how we perform relative to
them<00:01:10.580> difficult<00:01:11.580> I<00:01:11.939> find<00:01:11.970> it<00:01:12.360> very<00:01:12.390> difficult

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
them difficult I find it very difficult

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.859 
them difficult I find it very difficult
to<00:01:12.840> forecast<00:01:13.080> these<00:01:13.500> things<00:01:13.799> I<00:01:14.869> think

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
to forecast these things I think

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.630 
to forecast these things I think
certainly<00:01:16.350> the<00:01:18.259> McLaren<00:01:19.259> with<00:01:19.409> its<00:01:19.640> tricky

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
certainly the McLaren with its tricky

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.399 
certainly the McLaren with its tricky
rear<00:01:20.850> wing<00:01:21.060> is<00:01:21.390> very<00:01:21.630> fast<00:01:22.080> in<00:01:22.290> a<00:01:22.320> straight

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
rear wing is very fast in a straight

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.950 
rear wing is very fast in a straight
line<00:01:22.619> and<00:01:23.180> if<00:01:24.180> you<00:01:24.360> have<00:01:24.479> a<00:01:24.509> very<00:01:24.750> long

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
line and if you have a very long

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.020 
line and if you have a very long
straight<00:01:25.290> that's<00:01:25.530> that<00:01:26.009> place<00:01:26.280> them<00:01:26.640> which

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
straight that's that place them which

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.510 
straight that's that place them which
help<00:01:27.450> them<00:01:27.600> in<00:01:27.720> China<00:01:27.930> for<00:01:28.259> sure<00:01:28.560> coupled<00:01:29.400> with

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
help them in China for sure coupled with

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:30.890 
help them in China for sure coupled with
the<00:01:29.670> Mercedes<00:01:30.060> engine<00:01:30.210> which<00:01:30.509> is<00:01:30.630> obviously

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
the Mercedes engine which is obviously

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.600 
the Mercedes engine which is obviously
very<00:01:30.960> strong<00:01:32.570> catalunya<00:01:33.570> is<00:01:33.780> a<00:01:34.610> longest

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
very strong catalunya is a longest

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.310 
very strong catalunya is a longest
straight<00:01:35.880> but<00:01:36.119> not<00:01:36.270> as<00:01:36.390> long<00:01:36.509> as<00:01:36.689> China<00:01:36.960> so

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
straight but not as long as China so

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.130 
straight but not as long as China so
lots<00:01:38.220> of<00:01:38.310> high-speed<00:01:38.520> corners<00:01:39.180> so<00:01:39.420> hopefully

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
lots of high-speed corners so hopefully

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.770 
lots of high-speed corners so hopefully
that<00:01:40.320> will<00:01:40.549> be<00:01:41.549> reasonable<00:01:42.030> for<00:01:42.060> us<00:01:42.270> but<00:01:42.570> as<00:01:42.659> I

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
that will be reasonable for us but as I

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.440 
that will be reasonable for us but as I
say<00:01:42.960> it's<00:01:43.320> so<00:01:43.500> difficult<00:01:43.880> the<00:01:44.880> subtleties<00:01:45.270> of

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
say it's so difficult the subtleties of

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.480 
say it's so difficult the subtleties of
the<00:01:45.659> car's<00:01:46.350> performance<00:01:46.619> rather<00:01:47.070> to<00:01:47.369> each

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
the car's performance rather to each

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.149 
the car's performance rather to each
other<00:01:47.729> the<00:01:47.909> weather<00:01:48.090> conditions<00:01:48.740> so<00:01:49.740> forth<00:01:50.009> on

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
other the weather conditions so forth on

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:51.789 
other the weather conditions so forth on
the<00:01:50.250> day<00:01:50.399> I<00:01:50.430> found<00:01:50.729> it<00:01:50.909> very<00:01:50.939> hard<00:01:51.299> to<00:01:51.420> predict

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:51.799 
the day I found it very hard to predict

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:54.950 
the day I found it very hard to predict
where<00:01:52.799> we're<00:01:53.009> going<00:01:53.159> to<00:01:53.250> be<00:01:53.600> well<00:01:54.600> the<00:01:54.780> first

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
where we're going to be well the first

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.539 
where we're going to be well the first
obvious<00:01:55.320> thing<00:01:55.470> is<00:01:55.619> silly<00:01:56.219> little

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
obvious thing is silly little

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.060 
obvious thing is silly little
reliability<00:01:57.149> problems<00:01:57.479> we've<00:01:57.630> had<00:01:57.950> in<00:01:58.950> our

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
reliability problems we've had in our

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.179 
reliability problems we've had in our
case<00:01:59.369> with<00:01:59.909> the<00:02:00.000> wheel<00:02:00.149> nut<00:02:00.390> in<00:02:01.170> melbourn<00:02:01.950> and

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
case with the wheel nut in melbourn and

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:05.300 
case with the wheel nut in melbourn and
then<00:02:02.340> the<00:02:03.439> sparkplug<00:02:04.439> problem<00:02:04.950> that<00:02:05.070> Renault

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
then the sparkplug problem that Renault

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.340 
then the sparkplug problem that Renault
had<00:02:05.460> in<00:02:05.579> Bahrain<00:02:06.000> so<00:02:06.659> we<00:02:06.750> need<00:02:06.899> to<00:02:06.960> get<00:02:07.049> on<00:02:07.229> top

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
had in Bahrain so we need to get on top

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.080 
had in Bahrain so we need to get on top
of<00:02:07.409> those<00:02:07.590> silly<00:02:08.129> Azure<00:02:08.399> problems<00:02:08.729> they

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
of those silly Azure problems they

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.900 
of those silly Azure problems they
stopped<00:02:09.330> to<00:02:09.479> scoring<00:02:09.750> points<00:02:10.790> from<00:02:11.790> a

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
stopped to scoring points from a

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.610 
stopped to scoring points from a
performance<00:02:12.180> point<00:02:12.540> of<00:02:12.720> view<00:02:12.959> then

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
performance point of view then

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.300 
performance point of view then
it's<00:02:13.980> there's<00:02:14.849> no<00:02:15.030> one<00:02:15.569> glaring<00:02:16.019> problem<00:02:16.620> i'm

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
it's there's no one glaring problem i'm

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.369 
it's there's no one glaring problem i'm
happy<00:02:17.790> to<00:02:17.940> say<00:02:18.120> but<00:02:18.599> obviously<00:02:18.930> its<00:02:19.080> various

00:02:19.369 --> 00:02:19.379 
happy to say but obviously its various

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:22.280 
happy to say but obviously its various
areas<00:02:19.620> where<00:02:19.950> we'd<00:02:20.099> like<00:02:20.879> to<00:02:20.909> improve<00:02:21.360> on<00:02:21.720> some

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
areas where we'd like to improve on some

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:23.809 
areas where we'd like to improve on some
of<00:02:22.349> the<00:02:22.409> loose<00:02:22.560> low<00:02:22.890> speed<00:02:23.159> performance<00:02:23.340> we've

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
of the loose low speed performance we've

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:25.699 
of the loose low speed performance we've
got<00:02:23.940> monaco<00:02:24.629> coming<00:02:24.989> up<00:02:25.140> which<00:02:25.500> is<00:02:25.590> all

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
got monaco coming up which is all

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:28.520 
got monaco coming up which is all
predominantly<00:02:26.610> low<00:02:26.760> speed<00:02:27.060> corners<00:02:27.470> so<00:02:28.470> we

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
predominantly low speed corners so we

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.229 
predominantly low speed corners so we
want<00:02:28.680> to<00:02:28.739> do<00:02:28.860> some<00:02:29.040> more<00:02:29.069> work<00:02:29.220> in<00:02:29.549> that<00:02:29.670> area

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:32.239 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:34.670 

really<00:02:33.239> listening<00:02:33.599> to<00:02:33.659> the<00:02:33.900> drivers<00:02:34.260> comments

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
really listening to the drivers comments

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.890 
really listening to the drivers comments
they<00:02:35.459> still<00:02:35.730> reporting<00:02:36.180> a<00:02:36.239> bit<00:02:36.360> of<00:02:36.450> slow<00:02:36.629> speed

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
they still reporting a bit of slow speed

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.119 
they still reporting a bit of slow speed
understeer<00:02:37.379> in<00:02:37.500> the<00:02:37.590> middle<00:02:37.799> of<00:02:37.829> the<00:02:37.920> corner

00:02:38.119 --> 00:02:38.129 
understeer in the middle of the corner

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:40.839 
understeer in the middle of the corner
so<00:02:38.459> it<00:02:38.610> would<00:02:38.849> like<00:02:39.000> to<00:02:39.120> try<00:02:39.269> and<00:02:39.329> improve<00:02:39.390> that

00:02:40.839 --> 00:02:40.849 
so it would like to try and improve that

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:44.780 
so it would like to try and improve that
it's<00:02:41.849> is<00:02:42.599> honing<00:02:43.290> what<00:02:44.190> is<00:02:44.340> hopefully<00:02:44.549> a

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
it's is honing what is hopefully a

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.809 
it's is honing what is hopefully a
sensible<00:02:45.239> based<00:02:45.810> product<00:02:46.260> now<00:02:46.819> really

00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:47.819 
sensible based product now really

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:50.630 
sensible based product now really
getting<00:02:48.150> the<00:02:48.180> bodywork<00:02:49.079> upgrades<00:02:49.859> finished

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
getting the bodywork upgrades finished

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.030 
getting the bodywork upgrades finished
making<00:02:51.060> sure<00:02:51.239> that<00:02:51.859> aerodynamically<00:02:52.859> they

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
making sure that aerodynamically they

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.460 
making sure that aerodynamically they
work<00:02:53.310> structurally<00:02:54.209> they're<00:02:55.140> stiff<00:02:55.349> enough

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
work structurally they're stiff enough

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:59.330 
work structurally they're stiff enough
and<00:02:56.420> and<00:02:57.420> then<00:02:57.799> we'll<00:02:58.799> go<00:02:58.920> there<00:02:59.129> obviously

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
and and then we'll go there obviously

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.149 
and and then we'll go there obviously
the<00:03:00.090> lack<00:03:00.239> of<00:03:00.269> testing<00:03:00.750> we<00:03:00.870> have<00:03:01.019> now<00:03:01.230> then

00:03:02.149 --> 00:03:02.159 
the lack of testing we have now then

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:04.130 
the lack of testing we have now then
it's<00:03:02.370> difficult<00:03:02.849> to<00:03:03.000> do<00:03:03.090> back<00:03:03.299> to<00:03:03.329> back<00:03:03.480> so<00:03:03.989> we

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
it's difficult to do back to back so we

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.170 
it's difficult to do back to back so we
we<00:03:04.799> have<00:03:04.950> to<00:03:05.099> rely<00:03:05.400> on<00:03:05.549> our<00:03:05.640> wind<00:03:05.849> tunnel<00:03:05.940> and

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
we have to rely on our wind tunnel and

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.869 
we have to rely on our wind tunnel and
cfd<00:03:06.810> simulations<00:03:07.470> to<00:03:07.680> say<00:03:08.370> yes<00:03:08.609> these<00:03:08.819> are

00:03:08.869 --> 00:03:08.879 
cfd simulations to say yes these are

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:10.550 
cfd simulations to say yes these are
better<00:03:09.269> we<00:03:09.629> probably<00:03:09.810> won't<00:03:09.989> really<00:03:10.319> be<00:03:10.409> able

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
better we probably won't really be able

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:11.960 
better we probably won't really be able
to<00:03:10.769> check<00:03:10.980> properly<00:03:11.489> we<00:03:11.670> can't<00:03:11.849> do

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
to check properly we can't do

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:13.940 
to check properly we can't do
back-to-backs<00:03:12.590> sensibly<00:03:13.590> it's<00:03:13.739> a<00:03:13.799> race

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
back-to-backs sensibly it's a race

a little bit more out of it it's it's an

speaking<00:03:57.329> then<00:03:58.129> it's<00:03:59.129> really<00:03:59.430> about<00:03:59.519> trying

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150 
speaking then it's really about trying

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.539 
speaking then it's really about trying
to<00:04:00.269> understand<00:04:00.599> the<00:04:00.629> regulations<00:04:01.349> where<00:04:02.250> we

00:04:02.539 --> 00:04:02.549 
to understand the regulations where we

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:04.129 
to understand the regulations where we
felt<00:04:03.269> there<00:04:03.389> are<00:04:03.540> weaknesses<00:04:03.750> in<00:04:04.079> the

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:04.139 
felt there are weaknesses in the

00:04:04.139 --> 00:04:06.490 
felt there are weaknesses in the
previous<00:04:04.410> year's<00:04:04.680> car<00:04:04.919> that<00:04:05.340> we<00:04:05.849> can<00:04:05.879> correct

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:06.500 
previous year's car that we can correct

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:10.490 
previous year's car that we can correct
from<00:04:07.500> a<00:04:07.530> completely<00:04:08.160> new<00:04:08.340> design<00:04:08.549> and<00:04:09.500> that's

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 
from a completely new design and that's

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.800 
from a completely new design and that's
the<00:04:11.010> car<00:04:11.220> that<00:04:11.250> we<00:04:11.519> launched<00:04:11.879> in<00:04:12.030> in<00:04:12.269> January

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810 
the car that we launched in in January

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:14.839 
the car that we launched in in January
obviously<00:04:13.680> now<00:04:13.859> we're<00:04:14.040> into<00:04:14.160> the<00:04:14.370> development

00:04:14.839 --> 00:04:14.849 
obviously now we're into the development

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:16.909 
obviously now we're into the development
phase<00:04:14.879> of<00:04:15.209> that<00:04:15.359> car<00:04:15.599> you've<00:04:16.169> done<00:04:16.320> four<00:04:16.709> races

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:16.919 
phase of that car you've done four races

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:21.520 
phase of that car you've done four races
on<00:04:17.220> it<00:04:17.370> yes<00:04:18.209> Isis<00:04:18.949> listening<00:04:19.949> to<00:04:20.070> drivers

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:21.530 
on it yes Isis listening to drivers

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:24.260 
on it yes Isis listening to drivers
being<00:04:22.530> asking<00:04:23.219> them<00:04:23.340> to<00:04:23.460> be<00:04:23.580> very<00:04:23.610> critical<00:04:23.969> of

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:24.270 
being asking them to be very critical of

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:25.610 
being asking them to be very critical of
the<00:04:24.390> car<00:04:24.570> where<00:04:24.840> do<00:04:24.990> they<00:04:25.110> think<00:04:25.140> it<00:04:25.440> can<00:04:25.590> be

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 
the car where do they think it can be

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:27.560 
the car where do they think it can be
better<00:04:25.890> trying<00:04:26.820> to<00:04:26.940> understand

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:27.570 
better trying to understand

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:31.040 
better trying to understand
from<00:04:27.840> the<00:04:27.930> data<00:04:28.250> and<00:04:29.250> trying<00:04:29.820> to<00:04:29.970> match<00:04:30.180> what

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.050 
from the data and trying to match what

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:32.660 
from the data and trying to match what
we<00:04:31.200> see<00:04:31.380> in<00:04:31.470> the<00:04:31.560> data<00:04:31.710> to<00:04:32.040> their<00:04:32.190> comments

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:32.670 
we see in the data to their comments

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:35.660 
we see in the data to their comments
which<00:04:32.970> is<00:04:33.810> an<00:04:34.020> art<00:04:34.200> in<00:04:34.410> itself<00:04:34.670> because

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:35.670 
which is an art in itself because

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:37.250 
which is an art in itself because
obviously<00:04:35.790> the<00:04:36.060> data<00:04:36.240> is<00:04:36.450> effectively<00:04:36.990> a

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:37.260 
obviously the data is effectively a

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.380 
obviously the data is effectively a
bunch<00:04:37.650> of<00:04:37.770> scribbly<00:04:38.070> lines<00:04:38.400> which<00:04:38.760> we<00:04:39.150> have<00:04:39.270> to

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:39.390 
bunch of scribbly lines which we have to

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:41.450 
bunch of scribbly lines which we have to

or match to drive a comment and then

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:45.740 
or match to drive a comment and then
once<00:04:43.770> we've<00:04:43.950> done<00:04:44.100> that<00:04:44.160> then<00:04:45.120> it's<00:04:45.360> trying<00:04:45.660> to

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:45.750 
once we've done that then it's trying to

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:48.560 
once we've done that then it's trying to

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:48.570 
understand what that means in terms of

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:50.810 
understand what that means in terms of
