00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:18.040
 that's all of you who love 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:22.150
 see pg today we go we 

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:24.460
 interest in a Korean mmorpg game that 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:27.000
 is called ali so I will offer you 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:30.280
 a little the purpose of this graphics game 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.869
 who look pretty friendly who 

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:32.619
 apparently pleases a lot to his number 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:35.949
 users 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:38.890
 good it's going to be a pretty fast tutorial 

00:00:35.949 --> 00:00:40.390
 I will let go of gameplay for 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:44.020
 that you get to know them 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:45.940
 this world pretty colorful and in pastique 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:49.420
 which makes me think a little bit about 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:52.210
 the avatar universe and then I'll come back 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:54.190
 obviously give on to explain 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:56.800
 a few few game manifs 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:01:00.460
 so the very quickly so I'm in 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:02.620
 train to create a character there I had 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:05.530
 took place so as you noticed 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:08.350
 when you start the games you have to 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:11.140
 just identify yourself gray the other 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:15.040
 character and there you will land in the 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:16.630
 capital of thalys m6 high schools with 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.970
 pato pronounced but I think it's 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:22.510
 so you'll notice right away 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:25.420
 so beautifully a little she fixed 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:28.710
 fantastic it can change games from 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:31.000
 his was the habit of drinking 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.930
 besides, you do not like this game 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.090
 specially 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:37.210
 you can of course click and sound 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:39.070
 wiki attack mmorpg many others 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:41.530
 choice of game will you be offered 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:43.810
 in all different genres and you 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:45.520
 can obviously about the past by 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:47.920
 luc melenchon pg take advantage of offers 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:50.200
 special during the game as I have 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.430
 explained tooth but when my videos 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:55.570
 previous 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:58.299
 so all of us after creating your 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:01.570
 median axis character who will have his 

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:04.509
 own level of competence against 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:08.190
 cool down between six skills that are 

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:11.660
 power vitality precision 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:17.600
 agility intelligence and 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:21.280
 I think both of you will lead 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:24.620
 characters to start quests 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:26.690
 so this character will give you a miss 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.230
 China as there you see I will see 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:30.110
 character 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:31.850
 so he talks to us in this case mission 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:36.860
 I can win at the end of the mission 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:39.650
 obviously parts you see 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:42.170
 around also there are quite a few players 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:46.280
 around me who plays networking for 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:47.960
 me so I can go from character to 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:50.240
 mission character in mission I can 

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:53.320
 obviously free and a mission 

00:02:50.240 --> 00:03:03.260
 which is proposed to me there is no problem 

00:02:53.320 --> 00:03:05.360
 so this is to kill since 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:08.990
 contacted me but dad is 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:11.810
 is not so very good it's even at 

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:14.480
 turn actually we are not in danger so 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:17.680
 we even have to defend ourselves even 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:17.680
 issuing requests 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:31.260
 after obviously each mission 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:34.310
 you will receive rewards 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:37.910
 you will gain experience 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:39.930
 in your bar at the color level 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:42.870
 normally it goes bad at all 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:46.170
 new is the color of clear for 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:50.010
 the ccsa it is down in big sailboats in 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:52.110
 value their color bar blocked 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:56.280
 sewing and as long as that 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:58.890
 which you do etc etc and you 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:02.370
 go up and you go from level 1 level 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:05.520
 planus is at 2 above 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:08.160
 pardon at level 2 and as you go 

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:09.810
 I will soon arrive at level 3 so 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:13.100
 I 'm not crazy for you 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:13.100
 show on the one hand quietly 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:19.709
 that's why we have so many 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:24.330
 quests and battles it will be necessary to kill 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:29.520
 bottom of luck I 'm not recovering 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:32.700
 there I can recover the seeds listening 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:34.620
 maples in the hÃ©rault so me I you 

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:36.530
 advise to glean the Tamils they 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:40.140
 will all be funded because this game 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:43.650
 is really nice you will also see that 

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:45.919
 dodge is a lot of choices that are 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:49.620
 varied enough you can change the 

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:52.050
 corpulence of your hero the village and 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:55.370
 accessories like the interface dallaire 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:57.540
 and in 3d the complexion son is super nice 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:59.100
 there in the video when I think he 

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:02.010
 must be less fun to make them and he 

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:04.640
 is great it gives even more desire to 

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:04.640
 to play I find 

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:14.340
 this is the map 

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:19.020
 so I'm a stirring so just a 

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:23.930
 at level 3 the map is not yet 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:27.210
 completely finished at least the area 

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:29.780
 is still small zohra measure stop at 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:29.780
 grow 

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:41.879
 the fans that this vegetation its 

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:45.490
 colors it makes you want to play after 

00:05:41.879 --> 00:05:47.560
 maybe it's a little bit more 

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:49.569
 feminine that's why I also 

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:53.069
 prefers other games as we have seen 

00:05:49.569 --> 00:05:53.069
 in previous videos 

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:59.010
 because compared to their expiration 

00:05:55.860 --> 00:06:00.710
 a little magical but I think even 

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:04.490
 that they fall within the criteria and that 

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:04.490
 the 8 c on 

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:16.800
 Ouch has a lot of people what I'm going 

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:18.720
 to do is I'm going to give up 

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:21.180
 gameplay I lick or a little bit 

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:24.210
 watched me quietly and 

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:28.050
 questions you ask them you ask them 

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:29.940
 on youtube no worries me i think that 

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:32.250
 I'm going to you but that's where I left 

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:34.980
 take a tour let you discover by 

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:37.290
 yourself who only plays I recommend 

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:38.730

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:40.020
 do not want to be if you want her 

00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:42.180
