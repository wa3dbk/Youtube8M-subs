00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
different ways that you could do this

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.200 
different ways that you could do this
the<00:00:53.760> first<00:00:54.030> way<00:00:54.270> is<00:00:54.300> on<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.260> site<00:00:55.530> itself<00:00:56.210> so

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
the first way is on the site itself so

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.630 
the first way is on the site itself so
if<00:00:57.390> you<00:00:57.510> go<00:00:57.719> to<00:00:57.780> your<00:00:58.050> dashboard<00:00:58.320> and<00:00:59.010> you<00:00:59.460> go

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
if you go to your dashboard and you go

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.979 
if you go to your dashboard and you go
under<00:00:59.879> appearance<00:01:01.129> editor<00:01:02.539> once<00:01:03.539> you<00:01:03.750> open
