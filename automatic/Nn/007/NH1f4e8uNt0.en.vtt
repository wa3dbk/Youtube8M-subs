00:00:01.089 --> 00:00:04.470
 who honored all and welcome to the submarine he is 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.650
 I'm a solid and we test today 

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:11.529
 Parra the UdK Panic 

00:00:11.529 --> 00:00:14.919
 Eon bassist Parati Panic around 

00:00:14.919 --> 00:00:19.069
 very briefly explained that there is again a high score game where 

00:00:19.579 --> 00:00:24.629
 she's fun in it and i'm under it 

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:27.539
 by no means 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:28.859
 around 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.220
 Doodle Jump down there is Boulez John Brumby as well 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:36.740
 and that's why I think it's from the "doodle jump" is now 

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:39.290
 I go first to the settings 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:41.510
 and actually the settings 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:45.120
 there is for the first time but also and then you can of course synonymous iPod 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.550
 Make music here 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:50.560
 we can make out the music I find pretty cool 

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:53.560
 when we hear them sodden a bit louder 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.610
 been appointed as an encore to the Crown Prince 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:02.420
 Real mood when listening to the music 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:05.260
 then of course you can adjust the difficulty and the here 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.040
 you can name it 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:08.219
 enter 

00:01:08.219 --> 00:01:11.219
 and of course he will get the highscore list 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.350
 then of course there is never any rethinking 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:16.870
 and then there is still to come 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:17.830
 ready 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:21.560
 Trier is remodeling and priest offers the pronounced 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.960
 and then, of course, how does Dante play my status around my life 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.490
 how many times you have already eaten sharks in the water has fallen 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:30.930
 the latter sticks out 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:36.040
 and then of course he wants the and no means before and Ben Nord was fine 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:40.110
 and why is the Doodle Jump the Rumble Bee I do not know now how so 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.110
 said how can you have said then 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:45.960
 Probably just the creators come from Doodle Jump at Doodle John 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.630
 continue in this game 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.030
 now he is the first time I am young teens and also 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.860
 the whole thing is kept simple down here is a ship 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:00.610
 and up here, a plane flies and throws percent small stick figures 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:03.010
 from and through click on the stick figure 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:05.530
 the parachute opens 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:09.340
 and percent, that's how it works through the winter 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.229
 so in a bit of taxes 

00:02:11.229 --> 00:02:14.379
 the stick figure right and left around 

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:15.530
 Percent 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:21.069
 and yes that's how it works the whole game that's the whole game 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:21.730
 seen 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.760
 the only thing that has happened yet, and then that too 

00:02:25.669 --> 00:02:30.240
 coming back q4 and collecting my males or not 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:33.680
 a helicopter and you have to stop very quickly the helicopter and the u4 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.510
 Stop her now, for example, this exclamation mark says that to her now 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:39.879
 the side could - good or bad 

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:40.919
 that's it 

00:02:40.919 --> 00:02:42.469
 the um 

00:02:42.469 --> 00:02:44.769
 the percent due to cloud 

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:47.199
 I can go very briefly to the rain bridge that the 

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:50.109
 Hostel bonus points whether Lehmann on the trick 

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:53.709
 now you have seen I have been fried and at the same time best of three 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:54.519
 weeks 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:56.249
 Percent yes 

00:02:56.249 --> 00:03:00.339
 but the ball goes pretty fast and you honestly always have to 

00:03:00.339 --> 00:03:02.239
 Be Zack and watch 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:05.189
 now the ship is moving around that's a bit harder now 

00:03:05.189 --> 00:03:06.600
 of course I have to be my little man 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.790
 He steers the ship as fast as possible 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:12.540
 and we see we are coming back to one side so what is the game? 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:16.370
 "A little bit of hectic" means the first helicopter measured off 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:20.829
 with the fingerprints that explode so you're taking it all the time 

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:24.219
 busy at the game you do not have a quiet break 

00:03:24.219 --> 00:03:27.920
 but like her husband she is working fine in now and i also find game again 

00:03:28.779 --> 00:03:31.239
 Percent 80 cents okay 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:34.379
 if it now costs 80 cents so really said 

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:37.969
 and percent and that's also a Juso want that's why percent have it 

00:03:37.969 --> 00:03:40.790
 also tested times that took the longer the test 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:42.209
 came out 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:43.220
 the 2 4 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:44.799
 of course now 

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:48.499
 what is all about smooth resettlement as many men always do 

00:03:48.499 --> 00:03:50.909
 may still lose 

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:54.620
 and then here, of course, Sands Corp. how many points now so three instead 

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:58.019
 that reported the Apropos again bought back 

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:00.519
 the black jeans sent black hole 

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:01.919
 So you see 

00:04:01.919 --> 00:04:06.090
 Percent is quite funny and this fisherman also gives bonus points though 

00:04:06.089 --> 00:04:09.089
 somehow it does not work for me sometimes when I'm a jerk 

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:12.849
 uvo had to go back okay 

00:04:14.299 --> 00:04:18.859
 and percent one level ending does not exist so one is playing for so long 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:22.379
 until you're dead so that Manz is not anymore 

00:04:22.379 --> 00:04:25.840
 So you can create so until you're dead that you do not have any 

00:04:25.839 --> 00:04:27.050
 Man has lost 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:30.159
 By shaking off quickly there are many bonus points 

00:04:30.159 --> 00:04:33.029
 Of course I did not take care of that 1 

00:04:33.029 --> 00:04:34.999
 Binz Nevada liked 

00:04:34.999 --> 00:04:35.879
 times 

00:04:35.879 --> 00:04:40.179
 Here this sport means you get a life, but now 

00:04:40.179 --> 00:04:43.129
 again a little man but somehow 

00:04:43.129 --> 00:04:45.860
 Of course, I will not come to that and the Wars 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:48.430
 now I am born 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:52.240
 Hormann Hörbiger a super horny music that makes me really happy 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:56.110
 Let's make it a bit louder again 

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:01.930
 Friedrich just great and you can be natural now 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:05.590
 High scores off or you play the whole game again 

00:05:06.249 --> 00:05:07.139
 around 

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:08.599
 the whole thing is likely 

00:05:08.599 --> 00:05:10.919
 make a little prudent 

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:12.509
 with me unfortunately 

00:05:12.509 --> 00:05:13.860
 nothing too high 

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:17.659
 stopped that it is not so extremely addictive because it stops too 

00:05:19.259 --> 00:05:22.259
 Being heavy is extremely difficult for me 

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:27.950
 then came euro monthly and break down the commissions and 

00:05:29.319 --> 00:05:32.580
 you can also buy a life 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:36.440
 but of course that costs then percentage points and I have now 

00:05:36.439 --> 00:05:37.330
 Not 

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:40.699
 So if you just have points and you can do that by being able to get them 

00:05:40.699 --> 00:05:42.559
 to buy 

00:05:42.559 --> 00:05:47.029
 and percent then I still go my dog ​​is through the second brings that 

00:05:47.029 --> 00:05:50.479
 Of course I would be percent 

00:05:50.479 --> 00:05:53.849
 Pollert travels I hope that it is right 

00:05:55.279 --> 00:05:58.279
 and whether Rottweil Serpa Traismauer dead 

00:05:59.029 --> 00:06:01.400
 but I hate those words in these 

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:05.490
 Moon Bear had no life at all and the whole game goes on as long as 

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:07.039
 you want 

00:06:07.039 --> 00:06:08.030
 you can see 

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:10.289
 almost% it as sal 

00:06:10.289 --> 00:06:14.050
 take between bars but it does not bring anything if there are no points stop it 

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:16.830
 just to see everything not anymore 

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:20.309
 Now I finally do not have this fish 

00:06:20.309 --> 00:06:22.659
 it comes again from the side so 

00:06:22.659 --> 00:06:26.159
 I think he came too many Athens was in the so-called Hamptons 

00:06:26.159 --> 00:06:28.569
 Aachen still to be led 

00:06:28.569 --> 00:06:32.249
 So maybe the Doodle Jump was the last update and I hope that still 

00:06:32.249 --> 00:06:34.999
 more come from now because players spare 

00:06:34.999 --> 00:06:36.330
 makes a little bit of fun 

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:39.340
 if it has a little more opponents and not everything repeats itself 

00:06:40.059 --> 00:06:41.009
 here yes 

00:06:41.009 --> 00:06:45.060
 in the sense to subscribe to comment on stars do not forget to go
