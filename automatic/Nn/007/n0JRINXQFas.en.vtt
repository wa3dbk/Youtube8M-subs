what will happen is you'll go out the

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.690 
what will happen is you'll go out the
map<00:01:08.940> um<00:01:09.740> then<00:01:10.740> this<00:01:10.980> one<00:01:11.190> and<00:01:11.430> this<00:01:11.520> is

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
map um then this one and this is

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.400 
map um then this one and this is
actually<00:01:11.820> one<00:01:12.420> hundred<00:01:12.660> percent<00:01:12.720> random<00:01:13.290> I

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:13.410 
actually one hundred percent random I

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:16.820 
actually one hundred percent random I
never<00:01:13.710> actually<00:01:14.330> practice<00:01:15.330> this<00:01:15.830> either

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
never actually practice this either

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.680 
never actually practice this either
while<00:01:17.340> you<00:01:17.550> guys<00:01:17.790> will<00:01:18.000> see<00:01:18.150> like<00:01:18.330> I<00:01:18.450> don't<00:01:18.600> go

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:18.690 
while you guys will see like I don't go

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:21.770 
while you guys will see like I don't go
fully<00:01:18.930> of<00:01:19.080> the<00:01:19.230> map<00:01:19.380> like<00:01:20.120> well<00:01:21.120> not<00:01:21.390> this<00:01:21.570> one

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
fully of the map like well not this one

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.720 
fully of the map like well not this one
but<00:01:21.810> the<00:01:22.020> next<00:01:22.080> one<00:01:22.290> but<00:01:22.950> you<00:01:23.370> guys<00:01:23.490> will<00:01:23.670> see

but the next one but you guys will see

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:25.730 
but the next one but you guys will see
that<00:01:24.090> I<00:01:24.150> don't<00:01:24.480> go<00:01:24.540> fully<00:01:24.780> up<00:01:24.960> the<00:01:25.110> map<00:01:25.260> I<00:01:25.560> only

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
that I don't go fully up the map I only

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.090 
that I don't go fully up the map I only
go<00:01:25.950> actually<00:01:26.430> a<00:01:26.760> little<00:01:26.940> bit<00:01:27.210> and<00:01:27.740> if<00:01:28.740> you<00:01:28.920> guys

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
go actually a little bit and if you guys

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.530 
go actually a little bit and if you guys
do<00:01:29.280> go<00:01:29.430> for<00:01:29.580> the<00:01:29.640> other<00:01:29.880> map<00:01:30.030> it<00:01:30.240> should<00:01:30.360> be<00:01:30.420> a

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
do go for the other map it should be a

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.260 
do go for the other map it should be a
lot<00:01:30.600> easier<00:01:30.750> and<00:01:31.350> what<00:01:32.100> happens<00:01:32.490> is<00:01:32.670> you<00:01:33.090> get

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
lot easier and what happens is you get

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.700 
lot easier and what happens is you get
stuck<00:01:33.570> inside<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:33.990> dome<00:01:34.200> but<00:01:34.380> you're<00:01:34.530> like

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
stuck inside the dome but you're like

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.640 
stuck inside the dome but you're like
glitched<00:01:35.010> out<00:01:35.220> and<00:01:35.520> don't<00:01:36.270> have<00:01:36.450> PhD<00:01:37.050> because
