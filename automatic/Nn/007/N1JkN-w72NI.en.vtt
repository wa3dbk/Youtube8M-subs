got<00:00:01.020> a<00:00:01.050> 98<00:00:01.770> on<00:00:02.010> the<00:00:02.340> civic<00:00:02.639> EK<00:00:03.319> car<00:00:04.319> is<00:00:04.410> a<00:00:04.440> skunk

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:04.890 
got a 98 on the civic EK car is a skunk

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:07.579 
got a 98 on the civic EK car is a skunk
to<00:00:05.100> mega-power<00:00:05.819> exhaust<00:00:06.480> it's<00:00:06.990> going<00:00:07.170> to<00:00:07.350> are

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:07.589 
to mega-power exhaust it's going to are

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:10.640 
to mega-power exhaust it's going to are
just<00:00:08.040> a<00:00:08.160> single<00:00:08.550> are<00:00:08.790> it's<00:00:09.719> a<00:00:09.929> really<00:00:10.349> loud

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
just a single are it's a really loud

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.070 
just a single are it's a really loud
exhaust<00:00:11.130> some<00:00:11.880> guys<00:00:12.059> really<00:00:12.509> like<00:00:12.690> how<00:00:12.870> loud

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
exhaust some guys really like how loud

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.589 
exhaust some guys really like how loud
it<00:00:13.230> is<00:00:13.320> and<00:00:13.679> some<00:00:14.400> people<00:00:14.670> think<00:00:15.269> it's<00:00:15.420> a

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
it is and some people think it's a

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.060 
it is and some people think it's a
little<00:00:15.690> too<00:00:15.839> bad<00:00:16.320> so<00:00:17.039> this<00:00:17.850> customers<00:00:18.420> car

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:19.070 
little too bad so this customers car

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:22.340 
little too bad so this customers car
customer<00:00:20.070> decided<00:00:20.430> to<00:00:20.699> get<00:00:20.910> a<00:00:20.970> Moroso<00:00:21.660> spiral

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
customer decided to get a Moroso spiral

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.620 
customer decided to get a Moroso spiral
flow<00:00:22.680> resonator<00:00:23.310> it's<00:00:24.150> supposed<00:00:24.390> to<00:00:24.449> lower

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
flow resonator it's supposed to lower

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.320 
flow resonator it's supposed to lower
the<00:00:24.840> DB<00:00:25.230> rating<00:00:25.680> quite<00:00:25.980> a<00:00:26.010> bit<00:00:26.279> but<00:00:26.820> there's

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
the DB rating quite a bit but there's

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.929 
the DB rating quite a bit but there's
theory<00:00:27.810> that<00:00:27.930> it<00:00:28.050> might<00:00:28.260> actually<00:00:28.890> hinder<00:00:29.849> the

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
theory that it might actually hinder the

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.640 
theory that it might actually hinder the
horsepower<00:00:30.359> so<00:00:31.050> we're<00:00:31.170> gonna<00:00:31.260> put<00:00:31.470> this<00:00:31.590> thing

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
horsepower so we're gonna put this thing

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.440 
horsepower so we're gonna put this thing
in<00:00:32.040> figure<00:00:32.610> out<00:00:32.640> how<00:00:32.730> much<00:00:32.820> to<00:00:32.969> lower<00:00:33.120> the<00:00:33.239> desk

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
in figure out how much to lower the desk

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.479 
in figure out how much to lower the desk
bowl<00:00:33.660> and<00:00:33.870> then<00:00:34.110> read<00:00:34.890> put<00:00:35.010> it<00:00:35.100> on<00:00:35.190> the<00:00:35.280> dyno

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
bowl and then read put it on the dyno

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.430 
bowl and then read put it on the dyno
and<00:00:35.579> see<00:00:35.760> how<00:00:36.030> the<00:00:36.090> cartoons<00:00:36.630> out<00:00:36.809> the<00:00:37.200> cars

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
and see how the cartoons out the cars

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.470 
and see how the cartoons out the cars
are<00:00:37.620> the<00:00:37.649> GS<00:00:37.920> are<00:00:38.100> motor<00:00:38.399> with<00:00:38.670> a<00:00:38.700> supercharger

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
are the GS are motor with a supercharger

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.569 
are the GS are motor with a supercharger
and<00:00:39.629> it's<00:00:40.500> making<00:00:40.800> good<00:00:40.829> enough<00:00:41.129> horsepower

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
and it's making good enough horsepower

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:42.799 
and it's making good enough horsepower
so<00:00:41.760> we're<00:00:41.850> gonna<00:00:41.940> do<00:00:42.030> a<00:00:42.059> comparison<00:00:42.450> before

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
so we're gonna do a comparison before

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.900 
so we're gonna do a comparison before
and<00:00:42.899> after<00:00:43.110> so<00:00:43.739> I've<00:00:43.829> got<00:00:43.980> my<00:00:44.129> decibel<00:00:44.670> reader

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
and after so I've got my decibel reader

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.580 
and after so I've got my decibel reader
and<00:00:45.270> we're<00:00:45.719> gonna<00:00:45.809> go<00:00:45.930> ahead<00:00:46.050> and<00:00:46.170> start<00:00:46.410> this

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
and we're gonna go ahead and start this

00:00:46.590 --> 00:01:09.899 
and we're gonna go ahead and start this
car<00:00:46.860> and<00:00:47.070> see<00:00:47.370> how<00:00:47.489> loud<00:00:47.730> it<00:00:47.910> is<00:00:48.090> go<00:00:48.539> ahead

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:09.909 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:17.020 

some<00:01:10.479> naps<00:01:10.780> go<00:01:11.110> ahead

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:17.030 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:19.219 

kisara

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
kisara

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:24.230 
kisara
so<00:01:20.299> revving<00:01:21.299> the<00:01:21.420> car<00:01:21.689> and<00:01:22.460> not<00:01:23.460> even<00:01:23.700> in<00:01:23.820> Vitek

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
so revving the car and not even in Vitek

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.660 
so revving the car and not even in Vitek
not<00:01:24.539> driving<00:01:25.140> and<00:01:25.320> so<00:01:25.469> forth<00:01:25.710> we've<00:01:25.829> got<00:01:25.920> 120

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
not driving and so forth we've got 120

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.450 
not driving and so forth we've got 120
decibels<00:01:27.180> max<00:01:27.740> that's<00:01:28.740> like<00:01:28.950> I<00:01:29.009> said<00:01:29.219> this<00:01:29.310> is

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
decibels max that's like I said this is

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.270 
decibels max that's like I said this is
a<00:01:29.490> GSR<00:01:29.969> supercharged<00:01:30.810> its<00:01:31.409> stock<00:01:31.740> internals

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
a GSR supercharged its stock internals

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.219 
a GSR supercharged its stock internals
and<00:01:32.520> this<00:01:32.850> skunk<00:01:33.659> 2<00:01:33.899> mega<00:01:34.469> power<00:01:34.740> R<00:01:35.060> did<00:01:36.060> 120<00:01:36.689> so

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
and this skunk 2 mega power R did 120 so

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.050 
and this skunk 2 mega power R did 120 so
now<00:01:37.380> we're<00:01:37.770> gonna<00:01:37.860> try<00:01:38.100> to<00:01:38.130> install<00:01:38.549> this<00:01:38.789> mur

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
now we're gonna try to install this mur

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.270 
now we're gonna try to install this mur
also<00:01:39.390> spiral<00:01:39.869> flow<00:01:40.110> and<00:01:40.409> their<00:01:40.799> replacement

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
also spiral flow and their replacement

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.580 
also spiral flow and their replacement
of<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:41.429> original<00:01:41.490> resonator<00:01:42.270> and<00:01:42.539> see<00:01:43.380> if<00:01:43.469> we

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
of the original resonator and see if we

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.039 
of the original resonator and see if we
can<00:01:43.710> drop<00:01:43.860> the<00:01:44.009> DB<00:01:44.429> down<00:01:44.700> and<00:01:45.060> then<00:01:45.420> see<00:01:45.899> if<00:01:45.990> we

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
can drop the DB down and then see if we

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.779 
can drop the DB down and then see if we
lose<00:01:46.229> some<00:01:46.409> horsepower<00:01:46.829> or<00:01:47.189> if<00:01:47.369> we<00:01:47.490> don't<00:01:47.640> lose

00:01:47.779 --> 00:01:47.789 
lose some horsepower or if we don't lose

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:50.359 
lose some horsepower or if we don't lose
any<00:01:48.060> so<00:01:48.569> hopefully<00:01:49.229> the<00:01:49.500> next<00:01:49.530> video<00:01:50.039> clip

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
any so hopefully the next video clip

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.760 
any so hopefully the next video clip
added<00:01:50.759> on<00:01:50.880> to<00:01:51.030> this<00:01:51.149> will<00:01:51.539> be<00:01:51.569> of<00:01:52.020> what<00:01:52.649> it

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
added on to this will be of what it

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.240 
added on to this will be of what it
sounds<00:01:53.130> like<00:01:53.189> with<00:01:53.700> this<00:01:54.060> end<00:01:54.330> and<00:01:54.979> other<00:01:55.979> than

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
sounds like with this end and other than

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.429 
sounds like with this end and other than
that<00:01:56.429> and<00:01:56.970> then<00:01:57.209> the<00:01:57.390> final<00:01:57.720> one<00:01:57.750> will<00:01:57.959> be<00:01:58.079> what

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
that and then the final one will be what

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.130 
that and then the final one will be what
it<00:01:58.530> Tunes<00:01:58.740> out<00:01:58.920> at
