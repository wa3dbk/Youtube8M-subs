graphics<00:01:24.090> and<00:01:24.330> things<00:01:24.360> like<00:01:24.659> that<00:01:24.720> however

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
graphics and things like that however

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.170 
graphics and things like that however
the<00:01:25.680> people<00:01:25.920> that<00:01:26.070> have<00:01:26.189> been<00:01:26.400> purely<00:01:26.790> old

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
the people that have been purely old

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.450 
the people that have been purely old
school<00:01:27.540> players<00:01:27.720> are<00:01:28.470> a<00:01:28.530> little<00:01:28.740> bit<00:01:28.950> can<00:01:29.250> it

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
school players are a little bit can it

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.100 
school players are a little bit can it
bruh<00:01:29.970> hensive<00:01:30.329> about<00:01:30.509> the<00:01:30.600> whole<00:01:30.750> thing<00:01:30.780> and

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
bruh hensive about the whole thing and

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.530 
bruh hensive about the whole thing and
are<00:01:31.259> a<00:01:31.500> bit<00:01:32.430> very<00:01:32.700> about<00:01:33.030> you<00:01:33.240> know<00:01:33.329> getting

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
are a bit very about you know getting

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.740 
are a bit very about you know getting
into<00:01:33.900> runescape<00:01:34.290> 3<00:01:34.320> and<00:01:34.710> I<00:01:35.610> think<00:01:36.479> one<00:01:36.600> of<00:01:36.630> the

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
into runescape 3 and I think one of the

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.210 
into runescape 3 and I think one of the
main<00:01:36.780> reasons<00:01:37.200> is<00:01:37.320> you<00:01:37.650> know<00:01:37.740> when<00:01:37.860> you<00:01:37.950> spend

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
main reasons is you know when you spend

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.410 
main reasons is you know when you spend
so<00:01:38.970> much<00:01:39.180> time<00:01:39.240> on<00:01:39.720> air<00:01:40.200> kinda<00:01:41.000> 2007<00:01:42.000> version

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
so much time on air kinda 2007 version

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.539 
so much time on air kinda 2007 version
of<00:01:42.509> runescape<00:01:42.960> coming<00:01:43.799> back<00:01:43.950> to<00:01:44.130> a<00:01:44.159> game<00:01:44.399> like

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
of runescape coming back to a game like

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.340 
of runescape coming back to a game like
this<00:01:44.610> it's<00:01:45.060> kind<00:01:45.570> of<00:01:45.630> overwhelming<00:01:45.869> you<00:01:46.320> know

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
this it's kind of overwhelming you know

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.200 
this it's kind of overwhelming you know
you've<00:01:46.710> got<00:01:46.920> all<00:01:47.159> these<00:01:47.399> new<00:01:47.460> updates<00:01:48.030> all

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
you've got all these new updates all

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:49.789 
you've got all these new updates all
these<00:01:48.329> new<00:01:48.420> interfaces<00:01:48.869> you<00:01:49.439> got<00:01:49.560> to<00:01:49.680> learn

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
these new interfaces you got to learn

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.440 
these new interfaces you got to learn
again<00:01:50.100> not<00:01:50.430> to<00:01:50.549> mention<00:01:50.700> all<00:01:50.939> the<00:01:51.060> abilities

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
again not to mention all the abilities

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:52.789 
again not to mention all the abilities
if<00:01:51.840> you've<00:01:52.020> not<00:01:52.140> already<00:01:52.200> had<00:01:52.560> a<00:01:52.590> practice

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
if you've not already had a practice

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.410 
if you've not already had a practice
with<00:01:53.159> them<00:01:53.280> having<00:01:53.790> all<00:01:54.000> those<00:01:54.119> different

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
with them having all those different

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.810 
with them having all those different
ability<00:01:54.810> bars<00:01:55.020> thrown<00:01:55.380> at<00:01:55.470> you<00:01:55.560> once<00:01:55.860> is<00:01:56.100> you

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
ability bars thrown at you once is you

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.539 
ability bars thrown at you once is you
know<00:01:56.880> certainly<00:01:57.210> a<00:01:57.270> lot<00:01:57.390> to<00:01:57.450> deal<00:01:57.689> with<00:01:57.719> and

00:01:58.539 --> 00:01:58.549 
know certainly a lot to deal with and

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:00.770 
know certainly a lot to deal with and
I'm<00:01:59.549> trying<00:01:59.820> my<00:01:59.880> hardest<00:01:59.969> to<00:02:00.240> get<00:02:00.420> back<00:02:00.600> into

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
I'm trying my hardest to get back into

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.870 
I'm trying my hardest to get back into
this<00:02:01.020> and<00:02:01.259> and<00:02:01.649> just<00:02:02.280> learned<00:02:02.579> everything

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
this and and just learned everything

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.300 
this and and just learned everything
again<00:02:03.299> and<00:02:03.649> one<00:02:04.649> thing<00:02:04.829> I'd<00:02:04.950> really<00:02:05.159> like<00:02:05.250> to

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
again and one thing I'd really like to

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.340 
again and one thing I'd really like to
do<00:02:05.490> is<00:02:05.520> maybe<00:02:05.640> a<00:02:05.880> series<00:02:06.240> called<00:02:06.479> what's<00:02:07.200> up

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
do is maybe a series called what's up

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.190 
do is maybe a series called what's up
with<00:02:07.469> runescape<00:02:07.890> 3<00:02:07.920> and<00:02:08.340> in<00:02:09.300> this<00:02:09.869> series<00:02:10.080> I

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
with runescape 3 and in this series I

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.080 
with runescape 3 and in this series I
basically<00:02:10.530> sort<00:02:11.099> of<00:02:11.190> start<00:02:11.489> with<00:02:11.610> the<00:02:11.670> basics

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
basically sort of start with the basics

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.730 
basically sort of start with the basics
you<00:02:12.569> know<00:02:12.690> maybe<00:02:12.870> in<00:02:13.080> a<00:02:13.230> one<00:02:13.470> of<00:02:13.560> the

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
you know maybe in a one of the

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.050 
you know maybe in a one of the
our<00:02:13.800> episodes<00:02:14.340> I<00:02:14.580> could<00:02:14.760> go<00:02:14.850> over<00:02:14.940> the

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
our episodes I could go over the

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.550 
our episodes I could go over the
interface<00:02:15.450> what<00:02:15.720> you<00:02:15.840> can<00:02:16.230> to<00:02:16.320> do<00:02:16.410> with

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
interface what you can to do with

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.560 
interface what you can to do with
interface<00:02:17.010> have<00:02:17.520> you<00:02:17.700> rearrange<00:02:18.150> you<00:02:18.360> how<00:02:18.510> you

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:18.570 
interface have you rearrange you how you

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:21.110 
interface have you rearrange you how you
can<00:02:18.750> do<00:02:19.560> cool<00:02:19.830> things<00:02:19.920> with<00:02:20.250> it<00:02:20.430> some<00:02:20.910> may<00:02:21.060> be

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
can do cool things with it some may be

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.150 
can do cool things with it some may be
some<00:02:21.330> example<00:02:21.810> layouts<00:02:22.140> of<00:02:22.290> the<00:02:22.830> interface

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
some example layouts of the interface

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.070 
some example layouts of the interface
and<00:02:23.370> how<00:02:23.460> you<00:02:23.520> can<00:02:23.670> use<00:02:23.910> the<00:02:24.090> interface<00:02:24.480> for

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
and how you can use the interface for

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.060 
and how you can use the interface for
doing<00:02:25.350> different<00:02:25.620> things<00:02:25.650> that<00:02:25.890> everyone

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.070 
doing different things that everyone

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:28.730 
doing different things that everyone
scape<00:02:26.370> whether<00:02:26.550> you're<00:02:26.820> just<00:02:27.570> chillin<00:02:27.990> I<00:02:28.170> want

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740 
scape whether you're just chillin I want

to talk to people or you want to utilize

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.900 
to talk to people or you want to utilize
it<00:02:31.110> in<00:02:31.140> combat<00:02:31.650> I<00:02:31.890> have<00:02:32.490> things<00:02:32.670> like<00:02:32.790> that

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
it in combat I have things like that

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:34.970 
it in combat I have things like that
maybe<00:02:33.510> in<00:02:33.630> the<00:02:33.660> second<00:02:33.990> episode<00:02:34.110> we<00:02:34.680> could<00:02:34.830> go

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
maybe in the second episode we could go

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.790 
maybe in the second episode we could go
into<00:02:35.160> something<00:02:35.820> like<00:02:36.030> um<00:02:36.450> maybe<00:02:37.320> combat

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
into something like um maybe combat

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.440 
into something like um maybe combat
abilities<00:02:38.220> and<00:02:38.550> the<00:02:38.970> third<00:02:39.150> and<00:02:39.330> fourth

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
abilities and the third and fourth

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.870 
abilities and the third and fourth
episodes<00:02:39.960> could<00:02:40.200> be<00:02:40.350> range<00:02:40.770> and<00:02:41.100> mage<00:02:41.580> and

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
episodes could be range and mage and

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:43.880 
episodes could be range and mage and
just<00:02:42.480> things<00:02:42.630> like<00:02:42.750> that<00:02:42.870> so<00:02:43.170> let<00:02:43.710> me<00:02:43.800> know

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
just things like that so let me know

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:45.830 
just things like that so let me know
what<00:02:44.010> you<00:02:44.130> guys<00:02:44.250> would<00:02:44.670> think<00:02:45.000> of<00:02:45.210> a<00:02:45.360> series

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
what you guys would think of a series

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.110 
what you guys would think of a series
like<00:02:45.870> they're<00:02:46.170> basically<00:02:46.680> you<00:02:47.370> know<00:02:47.490> em<00:02:47.760> it

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
like they're basically you know em it

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.520 
like they're basically you know em it
might<00:02:48.270> start<00:02:48.480> off<00:02:48.600> quite<00:02:48.810> simple<00:02:49.230> but<00:02:49.260> then

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
might start off quite simple but then

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.560 
might start off quite simple but then
hopefully<00:02:49.980> get<00:02:50.550> into<00:02:50.790> a<00:02:50.850> bit<00:02:51.000> more<00:02:51.120> in<00:02:51.300> depth

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
hopefully get into a bit more in depth

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:54.470 
hopefully get into a bit more in depth
with<00:02:51.780> runescape<00:02:52.380> 3<00:02:52.410> and<00:02:53.000> kind<00:02:54.000> of<00:02:54.120> aim<00:02:54.300> its

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
with runescape 3 and kind of aim its

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.870 
with runescape 3 and kind of aim its
words<00:02:54.720> I<00:02:54.900> guess<00:02:55.080> people<00:02:55.500> that<00:02:56.130> maybe<00:02:56.610> we're<00:02:56.850> a

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
words I guess people that maybe we're a
