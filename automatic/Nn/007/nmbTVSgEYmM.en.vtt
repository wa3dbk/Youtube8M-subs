don't<00:01:56.520> want<00:01:56.640> them<00:01:56.700> to<00:01:56.790> run<00:01:56.909> over<00:01:57.060> the<00:01:57.240> edge<00:01:57.420> so

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
don't want them to run over the edge so

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.749 
don't want them to run over the edge so
you<00:01:57.780> should<00:01:57.960> probably<00:01:58.079> fill<00:01:58.560> it<00:01:58.649> up<00:01:58.770> about<00:01:59.040> 3/4

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
you should probably fill it up about 3/4

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.070 
you should probably fill it up about 3/4
of<00:01:59.790> the<00:01:59.969> way<00:02:00.500> alright<00:02:01.500> so<00:02:01.710> I<00:02:01.740> just

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:02.080 
of the way alright so I just

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.500 
of the way alright so I just
finished<00:02:02.350> pouring<00:02:02.800> the<00:02:03.250> batter<00:02:03.460> into<00:02:03.820> each<00:02:04.210> of

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:04.510 
finished pouring the batter into each of

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:06.690 
finished pouring the batter into each of
the<00:02:04.600> little<00:02:04.840> muffin<00:02:04.990> holes<00:02:05.380> and<00:02:05.680> our<00:02:06.280> sinking

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:06.700 
the little muffin holes and our sinking

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:08.280 
the little muffin holes and our sinking
with<00:02:06.880> this<00:02:07.060> recipe<00:02:07.480> if<00:02:07.600> you<00:02:07.660> don't<00:02:07.870> have<00:02:08.020> a

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:08.290 
with this recipe if you don't have a

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:10.950 
with this recipe if you don't have a
small<00:02:08.790> muffin<00:02:09.790> sheet<00:02:10.180> like<00:02:10.390> this<00:02:10.420> if<00:02:10.810> you're

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:10.960 
small muffin sheet like this if you're

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:12.810 
small muffin sheet like this if you're
maybe<00:02:11.170> using<00:02:11.380> a<00:02:11.560> bigger<00:02:11.770> one<00:02:11.980> you<00:02:12.190> might<00:02:12.670> only

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:12.820 
maybe using a bigger one you might only

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:14.970 
maybe using a bigger one you might only
get<00:02:13.030> three<00:02:13.360> to<00:02:13.480> four<00:02:13.720> muffins<00:02:14.140> and<00:02:14.380> the

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
get three to four muffins and the

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:16.350 
get three to four muffins and the
cooking<00:02:15.340> time<00:02:15.550> might<00:02:15.790> be<00:02:15.820> a<00:02:15.940> little<00:02:16.090> bit

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
cooking time might be a little bit

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.150 
cooking time might be a little bit
longer<00:02:17.080> because<00:02:17.350> there's<00:02:17.680> going<00:02:17.800> to<00:02:17.860> be<00:02:17.950> more

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
longer because there's going to be more

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.680 
longer because there's going to be more
to<00:02:18.280> cook<00:02:18.490> on<00:02:18.670> the<00:02:18.700> inside<00:02:19.120> but<00:02:19.360> with<00:02:19.510> these

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
to cook on the inside but with these

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:21.990 
to cook on the inside but with these
these<00:02:19.960> are<00:02:20.110> a<00:02:20.140> little<00:02:20.410> bit<00:02:20.530> smaller<00:02:21.000> probably

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
these are a little bit smaller probably

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.450 
these are a little bit smaller probably
around<00:02:22.270> half<00:02:22.780> the<00:02:22.990> size<00:02:23.200> of<00:02:23.470> a<00:02:23.560> normal<00:02:23.740> muffin

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:24.460 
around half the size of a normal muffin

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:26.970 
around half the size of a normal muffin
you<00:02:24.580> know<00:02:24.700> a<00:02:24.730> pretty<00:02:24.970> big<00:02:25.240> one<00:02:25.390> and<00:02:25.770> I'm<00:02:26.770> going

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
you know a pretty big one and I'm going

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.330 
you know a pretty big one and I'm going
to<00:02:27.040> put<00:02:27.220> these<00:02:27.460> in<00:02:27.820> the<00:02:28.420> oven<00:02:28.750> for<00:02:29.260> about<00:02:29.410> 350

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
to put these in the oven for about 350

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.370 
to put these in the oven for about 350
degrees<00:02:30.430> probably<00:02:31.030> for<00:02:31.750> around<00:02:31.810> 10<00:02:32.170> minutes

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:32.380 
degrees probably for around 10 minutes

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:33.720 
degrees probably for around 10 minutes
and<00:02:32.800> then<00:02:32.890> I'm<00:02:33.010> going<00:02:33.100> to<00:02:33.160> take<00:02:33.370> them<00:02:33.550> out<00:02:33.670> and

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
and then I'm going to take them out and

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:35.430 
and then I'm going to take them out and
check<00:02:34.150> on<00:02:34.330> them<00:02:34.480> and<00:02:34.870> if<00:02:34.960> they<00:02:35.080> need<00:02:35.230> to<00:02:35.260> go

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 
check on them and if they need to go

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.140 
check on them and if they need to go
back<00:02:35.710> in<00:02:35.890> I'll<00:02:36.040> put<00:02:36.190> them<00:02:36.250> back<00:02:36.310> in<00:02:36.610> but<00:02:36.880> I<00:02:36.910> say

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
back in I'll put them back in but I say

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.810 
back in I'll put them back in but I say
if<00:02:37.270> you're<00:02:37.390> using<00:02:37.500> a<00:02:38.500> bigger<00:02:38.950> size<00:02:39.340> sheet<00:02:39.640> you

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:39.820 
if you're using a bigger size sheet you

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:42.660 
if you're using a bigger size sheet you
should<00:02:40.000> probably<00:02:40.240> put<00:02:40.540> them<00:02:40.690> at<00:02:40.870> 350<00:02:41.680> for<00:02:41.709> 15

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
should probably put them at 350 for 15

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:44.520 
should probably put them at 350 for 15
to<00:02:43.060> 20<00:02:43.360> minutes<00:02:43.660> but<00:02:43.900> definitely<00:02:44.320> take<00:02:44.440> them

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
to 20 minutes but definitely take them

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:46.740 
to 20 minutes but definitely take them
out<00:02:44.680> at<00:02:44.800> 15<00:02:45.190> just<00:02:45.459> to<00:02:45.700> check<00:02:46.000> on<00:02:46.060> them<00:02:46.360> so<00:02:46.540> I

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
out at 15 just to check on them so I

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.480 
out at 15 just to check on them so I
will<00:02:47.140> see<00:02:47.260> you<00:02:47.350> guys<00:02:47.470> in<00:02:47.530> ten<00:02:47.890> minutes<00:02:48.220> when

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:48.490 
will see you guys in ten minutes when

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:51.000 
will see you guys in ten minutes when
these<00:02:48.970> are<00:02:49.150> hopefully<00:02:49.510> done<00:02:49.720> all<00:02:50.680> right<00:02:50.830> so

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
these are hopefully done all right so

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:52.680 
these are hopefully done all right so
here<00:02:51.220> we<00:02:51.250> are<00:02:51.400> 10<00:02:51.790> minutes<00:02:52.060> later<00:02:52.270> and<00:02:52.600> these

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
here we are 10 minutes later and these

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:53.760 
here we are 10 minutes later and these
turned<00:02:52.990> out<00:02:53.140> great

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:53.770 
turned out great

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:56.130 
turned out great
10<00:02:54.250> minutes<00:02:54.520> was<00:02:54.640> perfect<00:02:55.120> but<00:02:55.510> remember<00:02:55.930> like

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.140 
10 minutes was perfect but remember like

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.050 
10 minutes was perfect but remember like
I<00:02:56.260> said<00:02:56.470> if<00:02:56.560> you<00:02:56.680> have<00:02:56.770> a<00:02:56.800> smaller<00:02:57.130> size<00:02:57.430> it's

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
I said if you have a smaller size it's

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:59.370 
I said if you have a smaller size it's
going<00:02:58.270> to<00:02:58.330> take<00:02:58.510> less<00:02:58.690> time<00:02:58.750> so<00:02:59.260> you<00:02:59.350> should

00:02:59.370 --> 00:02:59.380 
going to take less time so you should

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:00.990 
going to take less time so you should
probably<00:02:59.560> just<00:02:59.800> keep<00:03:00.010> an<00:03:00.190> eye<00:03:00.310> on<00:03:00.340> those<00:03:00.640> and

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
probably just keep an eye on those and

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.090 
probably just keep an eye on those and
now<00:03:01.480> what<00:03:01.690> you're<00:03:01.810> going<00:03:01.959> to<00:03:01.990> do<00:03:02.200> so<00:03:02.590> to<00:03:02.650> add<00:03:02.920> in

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:03.100 
now what you're going to do so to add in

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:05.850 
now what you're going to do so to add in
some<00:03:03.370> nonstick<00:03:04.000> cooking<00:03:04.150> spray<00:03:04.450> is<00:03:04.959> just<00:03:05.650> pop

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:08.860 
them right out and that's going to do it

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:10.800 
them right out and that's going to do it
