 for more than 13 years it never gave me a problem 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:33.509
 It's a very good thing I'm going to give a 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.909

 If it 's good, anyway. 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:06.980

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:20.180
 here of cardiff classified cadillac 

00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:22.579
 that look does not go out anymore is it right 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:30.370
 it's still right here it's still right 

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:30.370
 I'm going to record here now, click here. 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:38.079
 the belt is at the point 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:01.510
 not even one detail was much 

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:04.780
 important I want to bring to you 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:07.090
 after you sync or all 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:10.210
 engine is now at the point 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:13.330
 synchronized never starting in the engine 

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:16.359
 if before you give at least a spin 

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:21.160
 complete in the motor only this here 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:24.340
 it will do a lot of the time you can 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:26.040
 feel you are all right and point 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:28.720
 match has not changed 

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:32.919
 You're going to do damage here in the 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:34.060
 head and will break the flute ipê na 

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:36.160
 day off 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:38.669
 So, you'll do it here, will you? 

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:42.130
 finished running you generate 

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:44.980
 complete turn checks that 

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:48.100
 Hit right, look, it's still straight. 

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:51.900
 and here it is, I'm going to take one more turn 

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:51.900
 for you to be calm 

00:04:55.500 --> 00:05:05.050
 happens very accident people who 

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:07.450
 are starting and boot strap 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:09.790
 engine start 

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:11.680
 your head is broken and maybe there 

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:15.070
 it's correct here 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:18.100
 If you want to also ask questions 

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:21.040
 about how it 's up here and if 

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:23.140
 observes a non-synchronized version of the 

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:27.160
 first silence has to be loose 

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:28.780
 so never starting the engine without you 

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:30.100
 check something else that I want 

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:34.600
 show you also 

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:38.350
 this tool that I have free school for 

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:40.780
 to be able to catch it by getting this screw 

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:45.460
 you tighten because it is too mechanical in the 

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:48.790
 time to remove the strap, he repeated the 

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:51.130
 screw on impact the impact is fine 

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:55.060
 taking out playing run out but on time 

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:56.979
 that you will put the police 

00:05:55.060 --> 00:06:01.210
 you can not squeeze the impact because 

00:05:56.979 --> 00:06:04.510
 otherwise you will compromise the resistance 

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:06.610
 of the belt 6 impact here you will goes 

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:08.340
 compromise your timing belt 

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:15.900
 you will get 

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:17.540
 if you look here here for I'll take 

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:24.690
 a screw 

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:28.440
 go there and I press the firm key that 

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:32.419
 How can I hold the power to tighten? 

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:35.550
 the police never tighten this screw and 

00:06:32.419 --> 00:06:38.850
 impact on the belt never do this 

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:41.340
 that you will compromise the service life 

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:44.250
 these straps will not be on time but 

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:46.889
 It may surprise you that they had 

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:52.729
 hobby tool that I'm developing 

00:06:46.889 --> 00:06:58.729
 I'll be able to lock the pulley I hope you 

00:06:52.729 --> 00:06:58.729
 He learned more on this show now 

00:06:59.839 --> 00:07:05.789
 finally showing how it got in 

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:11.460
 to the fairing 

00:07:05.789 --> 00:07:16.309
 look, once, put here 

00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:16.309
 the police will have to hit certain looks 

00:07:21.649 --> 00:07:31.399
 already had this is how you will put the 

00:07:28.649 --> 00:07:34.469
 200 engine at the point I do not have is just 

00:07:31.399 --> 00:07:35.189
 respect this tip that we put 

00:07:34.469 --> 00:07:37.699
 here for you 

00:07:35.189 --> 00:07:37.699
 thank you very much
