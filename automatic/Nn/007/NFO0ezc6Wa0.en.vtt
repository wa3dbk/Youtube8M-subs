00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
yeah those are 2d platformers but they

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:47.900

anything<00:02:51.090> to<00:02:51.329> explore<00:02:51.750> and<00:02:51.989> in<00:02:52.260> the<00:02:52.380> 3ds<00:02:52.709> and

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
anything to explore and in the 3ds and

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.550 
anything to explore and in the 3ds and

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
Wii U games you were time which doesn't

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.310

allow<00:02:55.650> you<00:02:55.769> to<00:02:55.859> explore<00:02:56.190> at<00:02:56.280> all<00:02:56.400> I<00:02:57.109> think<00:02:58.109> that

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:58.320 
allow you to explore at all I think that

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:59.870 
allow you to explore at all I think that
first-person<00:02:58.950> shooters<00:02:59.220> will<00:02:59.370> slowly<00:02:59.579> die

first-person shooters will slowly die

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.460 
first-person shooters will slowly die
out<00:03:00.060> and<00:03:00.269> we<00:03:00.390> will<00:03:00.510> see<00:03:00.570> a<00:03:00.720> return<00:03:01.019> in<00:03:01.230> 3d

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
out and we will see a return in 3d

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.710 
out and we will see a return in 3d
