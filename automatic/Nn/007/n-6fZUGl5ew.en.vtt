00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:13.660
 greetings friends and welcome to this 

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:15.340
 video where how to get the title then 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:17.740
 I 'm really going to be talking about what 

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:20.860
 should induction be the very same 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:23.800
 auto knocking me older in the living room of the 

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:29.110
 Fame 2014 but is not 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:29.529
 simple intensifying teleline and so on 

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:31.719
 etc 

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:34.360
 we go with all the way reason line 

00:00:31.719 --> 00:00:36.430
 number 30 we are also going then obviously 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:38.230
 that to return of what would come 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:41.289
 being my channel little by little I will be 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:43.300
 because already resuming the weekly activity 

00:00:41.289 --> 00:00:44.530
 of everything that is my channel they do not know anymore 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.179
 those talking about fighting the top 10 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:48.969
 etc. everything will be coming back 

00:00:46.179 --> 00:00:51.190
 it looks like 2014 and well it really went 

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:52.960
 I was going to come back doing the review of 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:54.640
 mont denario that just happened that 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.109
 It really was very good for those who 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:58.059
 they had the opportunity to see us and 

00:00:56.109 --> 00:01:00.039
 really in several things happened that 

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:01.839
 surely they will end up in good 

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:03.460
 stories towards now are line the 

00:01:01.839 --> 00:01:06.010
 way at least until this moment 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:09.130
 I know it's premature but it really is 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:10.840
 You see it looks pretty good but 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:13.329
 who have been watching my channel in the 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.320
 last years because he really knows what 

00:01:13.329 --> 00:01:16.270
 important that is for 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:18.670
 my goal not only the initiator 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:21.130
 favorite since I was a child of all 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:22.900
 many times will say 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:24.880
 the same is good onions you want to analyze 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:27.490
 I really believe that being a fighter 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:30.670
 not only do you have to have skill 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:32.110
 in the kingdom but have personal charisma 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:34.950
 Do not be bored that you have a 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:38.350
 impact that is striking etc 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:41.860
 in the ring obviously is not hard man 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:43.900
 it's not a range of hysterical etcetera 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:46.119
 etcetera and is far from doing it 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:48.520
 but really what I get I achieve 

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:52.240
 in his career I really think he should 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:53.920
 to be recognized and finally because it gives me 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:56.590
 very much liked that finally the wrestler 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:59.680
 favorite is induced into the room of the 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:01.570
 fame because it really deserves it 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:03.550
 starting because how nice that ya 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:05.740
 mimo yelina torito left me to fight 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:08.050
 they fought for many years for 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:11.320
 different issues from rights the 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:13.840
 optimum name about the dvd that 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:15.970
 came out in 2005 of willow strokes and moby 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.590
 of world where practically the tomita 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:19.989
 try 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:22.720
 discredit and destroy the legacy and 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:24.430
 others race not through the years 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.900
 which I think was lousy because if 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.599
 you analyze the history of the 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:31.420
 screw live in the late 80's and in 

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:32.470
 the 90s is finally always when 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:35.260
 you talk about who they were 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:36.910
 the top stars of the line that 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:39.340
 then obviously with hogan 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:41.319
 although mayweather and the sea â€‹â€‹take bless 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:42.970
 there were currently no superstars anymore 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:45.190
 great that they even that of a 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:47.680
 moment in two in the nineties where 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:50.049
 even a young man was not up to the task 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:52.959
 of the same ones of the goals suffer in 

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:54.940
 surpassed youngster so much in sales that she 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:58.000
 was more or a body in people like 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:03:00.040
 nowadays it is not that they go that they are 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.849
 really in that has the moment 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:06.220
 got logically was was the video 

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:08.379
 no of main event has really is 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:10.510
 obviously, better to walk 

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:13.520
 premiering this red in this culture 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:16.340
 now I use a little inside that 

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:18.290
 and that float badly but perfect but 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:20.780
 well this I think that fulfills its purpose 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:22.250
 to make this this video where 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:24.380
 well I really have to admit that the 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:25.970
 summary path and 30 is really seen 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:27.740
 very promising 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:30.110
 As I mentioned the night mold 

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:31.640
 normally he was very good with stories 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:33.620
 that will surely end something 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:37.730
 very interesting are summarized I think that 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:39.890
 It is still premature to talk about it being a 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:42.110
 great medium arm but at least in 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:46.790
 that moment before rolls rhombs I think 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:50.030
 that tommy 2014 at least I think that 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:51.710
 is painting pretty enough 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:53.330
 and then good gentlemen really 

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:55.250
 I just wanted to welcome you 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:59.600
 back to my channel here in the year 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:04:02.300
 2014 the proceeding to really win 

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:05.720
 very little by little we will be reforming 

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:07.160
 what would be the activity of 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:09.370
 my channel not talking about fighting 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:11.660
 our feet etcetera etcetera 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:13.790
 obviously the viruses of the steps by 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:15.680
 events the forecasts little by little 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:17.660
 we will be returning to the channel 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:19.400
 obviously in the next video because 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:21.410
 I will be already I have the results 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:23.990
 practically what was of the 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:26.150
 awards carlos down words to the best of 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:28.190
 2013 the video is made 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:30.320
 I also thought about starting that at 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:31.789
 beginning of the year but then optimism 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:35.539
 see what else I can say gentlemen 

00:04:31.789 --> 00:04:37.910
 really the induction to the best a 

00:04:35.539 --> 00:04:38.900
 Again, I think it's super deserved 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:41.360
 of the biggest 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:43.190
 itunes of the table and dominate all 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:45.050
 this story and probably wanted 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:48.860
 share this with you the ones that 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:51.410
 they know they know how they achieve it fanatic 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:53.660
 presided fiction of the optimal I really 

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:55.520
 I think this personally means 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:57.440
 a lot did not really want to share with 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:59.630
 you some things I was of 

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:02.330
 trip in the client state I had the 

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:04.580
 opportunity to get several things from 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:06.740
 memorabilia of objectives that nowadays 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:10.230
 it's not so easy to get and then 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:12.210
 I really think that that aside 

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:14.730
 to induction I think it was a bargain 

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:17.150
 because surely this is going to go up 

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:20.460
 go up in price I did not get a few 

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:22.800
 cards of what was being summarized 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:25.470
 it is no longer average number 6 cons against 

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:28.140
 hogan that really can then 

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:33.650
 obviously what catapulted much more to 

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:33.650
 what really is 

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:44.050
 and for a sound really this is this 

00:05:41.229 --> 00:05:47.460
 is all one who wants to share this 

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:53.979
 that really is worth gold to me, that's a 

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:56.770
 price and it 's a newspaper this hard of 

00:05:53.979 --> 00:05:59.530
 jail of durango means 6 on the step 

00:05:56.770 --> 00:06:02.680
 then first of April in the 

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:04.780
 loading about 16 so you can see the 

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:07.710
 date and on the top part then 

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:11.860
 it is noticeable and it is noticeable but says March 

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:14.169
 30 that's exactly two days before the 

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:17.380
 event this really I do not have to 

00:06:14.169 --> 00:06:20.199
 Mark for a lot and most of all I wanted to 

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:22.150
 share with you and friends this my 

00:06:20.199 --> 00:06:25.510
 daughter and surely knows the value of 

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:28.510
 these this really is a super mega 

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:33.479
 poster of the other one because this one could 

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:33.479
 get and you really is one thing 

00:06:35.669 --> 00:06:41.680
 this is a poster that came out in fact 

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:44.050
 I'm out there doing what 

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:46.690
 The magazine where this post appears is a 

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:49.660
 poster that I wanted to after we're 

00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:51.639
 speaking almost 24 years and finally I have it 

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:53.860
 it's in my hands but practically not 

00:06:51.639 --> 00:06:55.570
 I'm going like this I'm going to hang it somewhere and 

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:57.539
 I'm going to use the fund to do the 

00:06:55.570 --> 00:07:01.060
 euros then gentlemen then really

 of the fame of 2014 finally happens finally 

00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:14.650
 to get to that that pinnacle of 

00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:16.630
 career that really only lacked 

00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:17.979
 and you can hope that just as he did 

00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:20.350
 bret carr as he did for one 

00:07:17.979 --> 00:07:22.840
 sanmartino will now office word is 

00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:24.880
 a few months then really some 

00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:26.470
 others who also deserve a lot this 

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:29.020
 hall of fame like the macho 

00:07:26.470 --> 00:07:31.720
 manivist aviv is obviously one in the 

00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:33.610
 that must be behind on the list and then 

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:35.500
 others have also disappeared as 

00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:36.810
 in farc another that really does not deserve 

00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:39.000
 very much and then 

00:07:36.810 --> 00:07:40.470
 we want all those that those 

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:44.040
