00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.700
 poor welcome to a new doctoral 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.280
 all he would be showing how to power 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:17.310
 make a table of enchantment the table 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.949
 enchantment what is this if it is to the 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:23.189
 once enchantment when you turn the book 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:25.500
 it follows you well well let's go step the 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:28.170
 spells to need different 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.869
 material types these materials 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.610
 are going to should do these what we have 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.309
 opposite or aesthetic we are going to need 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:38.160
 four obsidian 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:40.739
 I go ahead and a book to make book 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.839
 I'll leave the discretion link in the 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.960
 link in the description and a little box 

00:00:42.839 --> 00:00:48.089
 here in the video that will now offer well 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:51.420
 to make it rusty what they are going to 

00:00:48.089 --> 00:00:54.929
 need the lava here we have lava me and 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:01:00.350
 water well because ice cream is water 

00:00:54.929 --> 00:01:02.829
 because when mixing water with pure 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:08.060
 I would pass this 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:11.030
 everything was turned into oxygen 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:14.000
 well what I recommend to practice the 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:16.380
 obsidian would be a peak demand already 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.110
 that is going to be more 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.860
 faster and I think it's with the only 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.970
 peak that can be chopped 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:26.880
 and let's move on to apply it 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.890
 how to put it takes a little bit in chopping 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.890
 but the block comes out 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.490
 well that's going to lead to four locks 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.250
 jana 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:39.009
 once you have been wanting to go to 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:42.070
 look for diamonds where you got 

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:43.570
 besides under the earth 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:44.720
 the diamonds will find it from this 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:46.820
 way 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:49.970
 in its natural form that would come to be 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:53.840
 so to practice it you also need a 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:54.370
 blog or a peak iron or diamond or 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.950
 gold 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:02:01.730
 again apply it as we see 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:04.370
 faster specific in mineral age of 

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:06.350
 diamond well process to build the 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:09.440
 diamond ore will be 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:12.680
 asking nothing what you have to do is 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:14.630
 spread it in an oven as it will be melted 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.610
 in a furnace the only thing they have to 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:18.290
 do is grab the oven go find 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:21.080
 carbon that also go against itself 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:23.630
 but diamond black like that with white 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:25.220
 that they're going against the black guy when 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:27.770
 it is bitten by salt and coal 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:31.040
 directly what they do puts them in the 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:34.330
 oven together this diamond mineral and 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:37.810
 then you will have the diamond like this 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:39.790
 I remember it was this kind of love 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:43.930
 and once we've had all four 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:46.060
 targets cute diamonds and what 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:48.340
 has to do this kraft what I have 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:51.640
 here opposite as it happens in the 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:54.250
 kraft table eo with the first yes 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:56.980
 places an obsidian base and a 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:03:00.190
 office in the middle of the nine cubes 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:03.280
 in the doctor then they put diamond on 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:05.489
 side of the middle I want in the part 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.489
 higher 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.730
 forming 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:23.049
 Decanting that is this 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:24.610
 now you will be fine now that you do not 

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:28.390
 lack to be able to treat it 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:31.780
 so that our system has what 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:35.319
 that you want efficiency and durability if you 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:37.120
 push the currents here and it's a lot 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:39.489
 plus 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:43.030
 For this, what you need is to go 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:46.599
 to kill bugs that appear at night or 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:47.799
 spiders that sometimes appear during the day but 

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:50.409
 they are neutral 

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:53.500
 the new attack as the night owes us 

00:03:50.409 --> 00:03:56.709
 kill enough true bugs 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:59.440
 in addition there are two videos of bugs you 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:01.650
 you will already have the necessary experience 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:04.860
 maximum to love 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:08.549
 an item of experience in youtube 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:12.150
 example I believe in singing a sword already 

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:13.829
 we have 30 experience all one is 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:18.690
 of lover for example that I will comment this 

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:22.789
 but here he does not appear 523 well 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:26.759
 for this to increase I would like to point 

00:04:22.789 --> 00:04:28.350
 river 5 eye already held low no we're not 

00:04:26.759 --> 00:04:30.510
 nothing 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:32.400
 the increases would be here to leave 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:35.190
 more options like this space I have 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:38.460
 put now has edge 4 push 2 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:40.710
 burning affection 2 0 3 for example if 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:42.630
 now they not only put the sword and 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:45.120
 we would give this number that says with 5 of 

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:48.390
 experience that 5 would be that we would deal 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:51.690
 5 experience of the capture emanated by 

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:54.289
 example we give you click and new passengers 

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:57.499
 anthropos nothing 

00:04:54.289 --> 00:05:03.069
 a very bad training also has 

00:04:57.499 --> 00:05:05.749
 edge 42 20 23 and second that looks 

00:05:03.069 --> 00:05:08.800
 worried more time getting the 

00:05:05.749 --> 00:05:08.800
 experience all 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:16.199
 Now you have to teach how to do it 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:19.020
 be able to increase these three levels to 

00:05:16.199 --> 00:05:21.060
 be able to make better enchantment to the shaft 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:22.900
 but now as you can see it appears to me 

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:28.470
 that is they have radio 

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:28.470
 I appear on a level 39 

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:33.240
 why 

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:35.880
 can from experience to 

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:38.340
 be able to enchant the sword what 

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:41.570
 will need is to have the table surround 

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:44.580
 charms surround it with libraries 

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:48.590
 let's make the library that link 

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:52.130
 I'll leave it in the description or here 

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:53.180
 or in a small box that will now appear very 

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:56.030
 all right 

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:58.190
 the child wants to make library too 

00:05:56.030 --> 00:06:00.650
 appears like a book does so it goes to 

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:03.460
 be the same 

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:09.039
 good a street they have made libraries 

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:09.039
 I recommend if you increase the level 

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:27.370
 then we libraries that's why 

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:27.370
 so much experience 

00:06:31.599 --> 00:06:40.699
 let's see what to do is place in squares 

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:43.160
 these translations so I do not 

00:06:40.699 --> 00:06:45.919
 level 30 appears with better 

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:48.830
 options but that the first one is the most 

00:06:45.919 --> 00:06:50.539
 low then when this is at level 5 

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:53.960
 there they only live enchantments in the 

00:06:50.539 --> 00:06:55.670
 30 for example now it came out 4 is going to be 

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:57.200
 I love Mexico better 

00:06:55.670 --> 00:07:00.290
 let's see 

00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:03.800
 the punishment 4 and push two are good 

00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:05.930
 options we consider as more of the 

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:09.529
 little bugs for that 

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:12.499
 that are new this every dead 

00:07:09.529 --> 00:07:15.499
 and good dear friends subscribers of
