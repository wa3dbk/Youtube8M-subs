you<00:02:23.840> go<00:02:24.840> to<00:02:24.900> the<00:02:25.080> GPS<00:02:26.000> folks<00:02:27.000> map<00:02:28.520> and<00:02:31.310> the<00:02:32.310> map

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
you go to the GPS folks map and the map

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:34.790 
you go to the GPS folks map and the map
positioning<00:02:33.300> and<00:02:33.810> you<00:02:33.989> see<00:02:34.200> that<00:02:34.380> you<00:02:34.590> don't

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
positioning and you see that you don't

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.210 
positioning and you see that you don't
have<00:02:34.980> 3d<00:02:35.820> perspective<00:02:36.709> as<00:02:37.709> one<00:02:38.040> of<00:02:38.130> the

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
have 3d perspective as one of the

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.130 
have 3d perspective as one of the
options<00:02:38.730> it<00:02:39.150> is<00:02:39.300> just<00:02:39.480> say<00:02:39.630> traveling

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
go see your GPS let's go down have a map

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:03.420 
go see your GPS let's go down have a map
breakup<00:04:01.180> not<00:04:01.689> positioning<00:04:02.439> and<00:04:02.680> then<00:04:02.980> we<00:04:03.189> have

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.430 
breakup not positioning and then we have

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:05.689 
breakup not positioning and then we have
perspective<00:04:03.969> it's<00:04:04.480> one<00:04:04.629> of<00:04:04.750> your<00:04:04.840> options<00:04:05.409> so

00:04:05.689 --> 00:04:05.699 
perspective it's one of your options so

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:08.369 
perspective it's one of your options so
that's<00:04:06.699> how<00:04:06.849> you<00:04:06.909> turn<00:04:07.180> it<00:04:07.299> on<00:04:07.419> never<00:04:08.139> look

00:04:08.369 --> 00:04:08.379 
that's how you turn it on never look

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:10.050 
that's how you turn it on never look
like<00:04:08.560> it<00:04:08.709> changed<00:04:09.040> my<00:04:09.129> map<00:04:09.310> anyway<00:04:09.730> since<00:04:09.939> I

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:10.060 
like it changed my map anyway since I

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:11.819 
like it changed my map anyway since I
already<00:04:10.299> had<00:04:10.569> it<00:04:10.689> set<00:04:10.870> to<00:04:10.900> perspective<00:04:11.620> before

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:11.829 
already had it set to perspective before

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:13.740 
already had it set to perspective before
I<00:04:11.980> checked<00:04:12.250> it<00:04:12.370> off<00:04:12.489> look<00:04:13.090> like<00:04:13.269> it<00:04:13.419> just<00:04:13.449> kept

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:13.750 
I checked it off look like it just kept

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:16.349 
I checked it off look like it just kept
it<00:04:13.930> there<00:04:14.049> so<00:04:14.370> it<00:04:15.370> never<00:04:15.579> really<00:04:15.760> changed<00:04:16.329> but

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:16.359 
it there so it never really changed but

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:18.180 
it there so it never really changed but
that's<00:04:16.539> how<00:04:16.690> you<00:04:16.750> do<00:04:16.989> that<00:04:17.139> if<00:04:17.259> you<00:04:17.410> have<00:04:17.889> like

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:18.190 
that's how you do that if you have like

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:20.069 
that's how you do that if you have like
