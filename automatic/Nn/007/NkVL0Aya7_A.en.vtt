quite difficult to drag and create a hit
and<00:00:22.300> miss<00:00:22.330> effect<00:00:22.840> so<00:00:23.500> the<00:00:24.130> technique<00:00:24.550> more<00:00:24.850> is

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:25.150 
and miss effect so the technique more is

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:27.930 
and miss effect so the technique more is

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920 
little bits of highlighted I was gonna

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:01.860 
little bits of highlighted I was gonna
say<00:03:00.130> white<00:03:00.370> paper<00:03:00.670> it's<00:03:00.970> not<00:03:01.060> because<00:03:01.540> the

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
say white paper it's not because the

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:03.840 
say white paper it's not because the
advantage<00:03:02.350> of<00:03:02.530> covering<00:03:03.280> it<00:03:03.370> earlier<00:03:03.760> with

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:03.850 
advantage of covering it earlier with

advantage of covering it earlier with
the<00:03:03.940> raw<00:03:04.120> Sienna<00:03:04.510> means<00:03:05.170> that<00:03:05.380> the<00:03:05.470> highlights

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920 
the raw Sienna means that the highlights

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:07.470 
the raw Sienna means that the highlights
are<00:03:06.100> actually<00:03:06.310> going<00:03:06.430> to<00:03:06.520> be<00:03:06.610> very<00:03:07.030> very<00:03:07.270> warm

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
are actually going to be very very warm

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.570 
are actually going to be very very warm
not<00:03:07.750> gonna<00:03:07.930> be<00:03:08.020> stark<00:03:08.350> white<00:03:08.620> they're<00:03:09.430> gonna

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
bristles you can see I can get some

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:19.050 
bristles you can see I can get some
slightly<00:03:15.670> more<00:03:15.820> raggedy<00:03:16.630> effects<00:03:18.030> and<00:03:19.030> just

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
slightly more raggedy effects and just

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:22.740 
slightly more raggedy effects and just
managing<00:03:19.750> to<00:03:19.930> push<00:03:20.680> enough<00:03:21.220> of<00:03:21.400> that<00:03:21.750> pigment

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750 
managing to push enough of that pigment

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:25.920 
managing to push enough of that pigment
around<00:03:23.080> there<00:03:23.470> the<00:03:23.980> dark<00:03:24.280> pigment<00:03:24.810> just<00:03:25.810> to

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 
around there the dark pigment just to

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:29.250 
around there the dark pigment just to
let<00:03:26.050> it<00:03:26.170> blend<00:03:26.380> gently<00:03:27.600> and<00:03:28.600> then<00:03:28.840> we'll<00:03:28.990> just

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260 
let it blend gently and then we'll just

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.040 
let it blend gently and then we'll just
clear<00:03:29.860> out<00:03:30.100> the<00:03:30.520> space<00:03:31.180> where<00:03:31.480> the<00:03:31.600> rock<00:03:31.840> is

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:32.050 
clear out the space where the rock is

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:36.270 
clear out the space where the rock is
just<00:03:32.320> to<00:03:32.500> make<00:03:32.680> sure<00:03:32.950> it's<00:03:33.940> absolutely<00:03:35.280> shape

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:36.280 
just to make sure it's absolutely shape

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:37.860 
just to make sure it's absolutely shape
we<00:03:36.460> want<00:03:36.670> this<00:03:36.820> we're<00:03:37.240> gonna<00:03:37.360> have<00:03:37.540> that<00:03:37.660> as<00:03:37.840> a

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:37.870 
we want this we're gonna have that as a

blue gray some blue gray into the shadow
area<00:03:42.130> we<00:03:42.610> still<00:03:42.670> want<00:03:43.000> it<00:03:43.060> reasonably<00:03:43.510> light

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:43.750 
area we still want it reasonably light

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:46.310 
area we still want it reasonably light
so<00:03:44.050> we'll<00:03:44.230> just<00:03:44.440> leave<00:03:44.620> a<00:03:44.680> little<00:03:45.130> bit<00:03:45.280> of

so we'll just leave a little bit of

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:50.670 
so we'll just leave a little bit of
light<00:03:47.320> patch<00:03:47.590> on<00:03:47.830> it<00:03:48.570> now<00:03:49.570> to<00:03:50.140> see<00:03:50.290> the<00:03:50.410> point<00:03:50.530> I

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:50.680 
light patch on it now to see the point I

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:52.650 
light patch on it now to see the point I
was<00:03:50.739> making<00:03:50.800> before<00:03:51.070> about<00:03:51.790> these<00:03:52.090> branches

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:52.660 
was making before about these branches

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:55.170 
was making before about these branches
just<00:03:53.500> the<00:03:53.650> simple<00:03:54.040> act<00:03:54.220> of<00:03:54.400> putting<00:03:54.910> these

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:55.180 
just the simple act of putting these

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:59.460 
just the simple act of putting these
branches<00:03:57.150> across<00:03:58.150> the<00:03:58.720> front<00:03:58.989> of<00:03:59.080> the<00:03:59.200> church

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:15.360 
moment or two myself just lift it out a
little<00:04:14.260> bit<00:04:14.410> of<00:04:14.560> that<00:04:14.620> color<00:04:14.860> which<00:04:15.100> it<00:04:15.250> got<00:04:15.340> a

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:15.370 
little bit of that color which it got a

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:16.650 
little bit of that color which it got a
little<00:04:15.519> bit<00:04:15.730> too<00:04:15.910> dark<00:04:16.180> in<00:04:16.359> the<00:04:16.450> bell<00:04:16.630> tower

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:16.660 
little bit too dark in the bell tower

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:19.199 
little bit too dark in the bell tower
but<00:04:17.320> as<00:04:17.560> far<00:04:17.830> as<00:04:17.859> the<00:04:18.010> painting<00:04:18.400> goes<00:04:18.609> that's

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:19.209 
but as far as the painting goes that's

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:19.970 
but as far as the painting goes that's
it

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:19.980 
it

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:22.409 
it
right<00:04:20.980> now<00:04:21.130> I've<00:04:21.370> started<00:04:21.669> doing<00:04:22.060> some<00:04:22.270> of<00:04:22.300> the

00:04:22.409 --> 00:04:22.419 
right now I've started doing some of the

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:25.320 
right now I've started doing some of the
pen<00:04:22.630> work<00:04:22.870> but<00:04:23.650> you<00:04:23.890> can<00:04:23.919> see<00:04:24.310> I've<00:04:24.580> done<00:04:24.640> very

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:25.330 
pen work but you can see I've done very

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:27.240 
pen work but you can see I've done very
little<00:04:25.690> in<00:04:25.870> the<00:04:25.990> background<00:04:26.530> just<00:04:26.830> a<00:04:27.010> hint

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:27.250 
little in the background just a hint

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:30.240 
little in the background just a hint
here<00:04:27.490> just<00:04:27.850> to<00:04:28.030> put<00:04:28.660> a<00:04:28.720> few<00:04:28.960> louvers<00:04:29.440> in<00:04:29.470> I'm

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:30.250 
here just to put a few louvers in I'm

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:33.240 
here just to put a few louvers in I'm
using<00:04:30.610> the<00:04:30.940> sepia<00:04:31.810> color<00:04:31.870> but<00:04:32.560> nothing<00:04:33.010> too

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:33.250 
using the sepia color but nothing too

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:35.550 
using the sepia color but nothing too
detailed<00:04:33.669> because<00:04:34.120> the<00:04:34.570> further<00:04:34.840> niacin<00:04:35.440> is

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:35.560 
detailed because the further niacin is

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:38.400 
detailed because the further niacin is
away<00:04:35.860> then<00:04:36.550> the<00:04:36.820> less<00:04:37.030> detail<00:04:37.540> it'll<00:04:38.020> have<00:04:38.200> and

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:38.410 
away then the less detail it'll have and

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:40.200 
away then the less detail it'll have and
in<00:04:38.500> fact<00:04:38.740> if<00:04:38.830> you<00:04:38.890> put<00:04:38.919> too<00:04:39.280> much<00:04:39.310> pen<00:04:39.730> work<00:04:39.940> in

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:40.210 
in fact if you put too much pen work in

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:41.970 
in fact if you put too much pen work in
it's<00:04:40.630> going<00:04:40.810> to<00:04:40.870> bring<00:04:41.050> everything<00:04:41.320> too<00:04:41.740> far

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:41.980 
it's going to bring everything too far

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:44.520 
it's going to bring everything too far
forward<00:04:42.520> the<00:04:43.450> reason<00:04:43.810> it's<00:04:43.960> identity<00:04:44.380> that

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:44.530 
forward the reason it's identity that

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:46.920 
forward the reason it's identity that
I'm<00:04:44.590> using<00:04:44.830> Brown<00:04:45.340> is<00:04:45.970> that<00:04:46.210> I<00:04:46.330> personally

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:46.930 
I'm using Brown is that I personally

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:49.440 
I'm using Brown is that I personally
find<00:04:47.169> that<00:04:47.350> the<00:04:48.070> black<00:04:48.340> can<00:04:48.730> at<00:04:48.880> times<00:04:48.910> guess

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:49.450 
find that the black can at times guess

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:50.850 
find that the black can at times guess
particularly<00:04:50.110> if<00:04:50.230> you're<00:04:50.350> learning<00:04:50.710> how<00:04:50.830> to

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:50.860 
particularly if you're learning how to

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:53.900 
particularly if you're learning how to
use<00:04:51.190> this<00:04:51.400> it<00:04:52.030> can<00:04:52.360> get<00:04:52.510> a<00:04:52.570> little<00:04:52.750> bit<00:04:52.990> stark<00:04:53.500> I

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:53.910 
use this it can get a little bit stark I

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:57.350 
use this it can get a little bit stark I
suggest<00:04:54.910> that<00:04:55.570> if<00:04:55.840> you're<00:04:56.020> going<00:04:56.200> to<00:04:56.350> use

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:57.360 
suggest that if you're going to use

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:00.140 
suggest that if you're going to use
PanAm<00:04:57.659> wash<00:04:57.990> try<00:04:58.740> starting<00:04:59.340> off<00:04:59.460> at<00:04:59.610> least<00:04:59.759> try

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:00.150 
PanAm wash try starting off at least try

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:04.309 
PanAm wash try starting off at least try
using<00:05:00.689> the<00:05:01.229> brown<00:05:01.500> ink<00:05:02.060> because<00:05:03.199> it's<00:05:04.199> a

00:05:04.309 --> 00:05:04.319 
using the brown ink because it's a

00:05:04.319 --> 00:05:06.020 
using the brown ink because it's a
little<00:05:04.469> bit<00:05:04.650> more<00:05:04.860> rustic<00:05:05.129> it's<00:05:05.520> sort<00:05:05.789> of<00:05:05.849> more

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:06.030 
little bit more rustic it's sort of more

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:07.760 
little bit more rustic it's sort of more
in<00:05:06.150> keeping<00:05:06.330> with<00:05:06.569> the<00:05:06.750> brown<00:05:06.960> colors<00:05:07.439> anyway

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:07.770 
in keeping with the brown colors anyway

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:13.129 
in keeping with the brown colors anyway
on<00:05:07.949> the<00:05:08.840> on<00:05:09.840> the<00:05:09.990> picture<00:05:10.439> and<00:05:11.569> it<00:05:12.569> won't<00:05:12.840> stand

00:05:13.129 --> 00:05:13.139 
on the on the picture and it won't stand

00:05:13.139 --> 00:05:15.800 
on the on the picture and it won't stand
out<00:05:13.319> quite<00:05:13.680> so<00:05:13.710> much<00:05:14.039> if<00:05:14.310> if<00:05:15.030> things<00:05:15.360> don't<00:05:15.599> all

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:15.810 
out quite so much if if things don't all

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:19.429 
out quite so much if if things don't all
go<00:05:16.020> perfectly<00:05:16.650> to<00:05:16.830> plan<00:05:18.080> right<00:05:19.080> now<00:05:19.229> what<00:05:19.409> I

00:05:19.429 --> 00:05:19.439 
go perfectly to plan right now what I

00:05:19.439 --> 00:05:23.659 
go perfectly to plan right now what I
happened<00:05:19.800> done<00:05:19.979> was<00:05:20.310> to<00:05:21.979> bring<00:05:22.979> some<00:05:23.219> shadows

00:05:23.659 --> 00:05:23.669 
happened done was to bring some shadows

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:29.779 
happened done was to bring some shadows
in<00:05:23.789> here<00:05:24.229> which<00:05:25.879> helps<00:05:26.879> to<00:05:28.789> highlight

00:05:29.779 --> 00:05:29.789 
in here which helps to highlight

00:05:29.789 --> 00:05:32.179 
in here which helps to highlight
everything<00:05:30.150> and<00:05:30.360> lead<00:05:31.169> the<00:05:31.379> eye<00:05:31.409> into<00:05:31.860> this

00:05:32.179 --> 00:05:32.189 
everything and lead the eye into this

00:05:32.189 --> 00:05:34.519 
everything and lead the eye into this
sort<00:05:32.460> of<00:05:32.490> area<00:05:32.729> here<00:05:33.090> right<00:05:33.779> now<00:05:33.960> you<00:05:34.020> can<00:05:34.259> see

00:05:34.519 --> 00:05:34.529 
sort of area here right now you can see

00:05:34.529 --> 00:05:37.820 
sort of area here right now you can see
I'm<00:05:34.800> just<00:05:35.099> adding<00:05:35.550> in<00:05:35.879> some<00:05:36.090> of<00:05:36.569> the<00:05:36.779> detail<00:05:37.590> on

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:37.830 
I'm just adding in some of the detail on

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:39.559 
I'm just adding in some of the detail on
the<00:05:37.949> branches<00:05:38.430> and<00:05:38.669> really<00:05:39.419> I'm<00:05:39.509> just

00:05:39.559 --> 00:05:39.569 
the branches and really I'm just

00:05:39.569 --> 00:05:41.749 
the branches and really I'm just
concentrating<00:05:40.560> on<00:05:40.680> the<00:05:40.740> bit<00:05:40.979> of<00:05:41.159> the<00:05:41.189> branches

00:05:41.749 --> 00:05:41.759 
concentrating on the bit of the branches

00:05:41.759 --> 00:05:46.459 
concentrating on the bit of the branches
that<00:05:42.479> I<00:05:42.539> feel<00:05:42.870> would<00:05:43.139> be<00:05:43.379> either<00:05:44.509> in<00:05:45.509> shadow<00:05:46.169> or

00:05:46.459 --> 00:05:46.469 
that I feel would be either in shadow or

00:05:46.469 --> 00:05:49.850 
that I feel would be either in shadow or
would<00:05:47.219> benefit<00:05:47.789> from<00:05:48.110> space<00:05:49.110> strengthened

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:49.860 
would benefit from space strengthened

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:53.749 
would benefit from space strengthened
for<00:05:50.460> example<00:05:51.000> across<00:05:51.659> the<00:05:52.560> front<00:05:52.889> of<00:05:53.129> the

00:05:53.749 --> 00:05:53.759 
for example across the front of the

00:05:53.759 --> 00:05:57.170 
for example across the front of the
church<00:05:54.000> I<00:05:54.449> hope<00:05:55.409> you<00:05:55.620> can<00:05:55.770> see<00:05:56.039> that<00:05:56.370> by<00:05:56.909> using

00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:57.180 
church I hope you can see that by using

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:59.629 
church I hope you can see that by using
hot<00:05:57.960> pressed<00:05:58.259> paper<00:05:58.349> yeah<00:05:59.009> it<00:05:59.189> does<00:05:59.400> take<00:05:59.610> a

00:05:59.629 --> 00:05:59.639 
hot pressed paper yeah it does take a

00:05:59.639 --> 00:06:01.790 
hot pressed paper yeah it does take a
little<00:05:59.789> getting<00:06:00.150> used<00:06:00.389> to<00:06:00.629> when<00:06:01.259> especially

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:01.800 
little getting used to when especially

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:03.920 
little getting used to when especially
when<00:06:01.919> you're<00:06:02.039> putting<00:06:02.190> skies<00:06:02.639> on<00:06:02.909> but<00:06:03.479> you<00:06:03.810> can

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:03.930 
when you're putting skies on but you can

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:06.019 
when you're putting skies on but you can
see<00:06:04.139> the<00:06:04.289> beautiful<00:06:04.800> way<00:06:04.979> the<00:06:05.250> colors<00:06:05.669> blend

00:06:06.019 --> 00:06:06.029 
see the beautiful way the colors blend

00:06:06.029 --> 00:06:10.219 
see the beautiful way the colors blend
in<00:06:06.479> a<00:06:06.599> very<00:06:06.990> very<00:06:07.229> or<00:06:08.129> surreal<00:06:08.819> way<00:06:09.139> that<00:06:10.139> you

00:06:10.219 --> 00:06:10.229 
in a very very or surreal way that you

00:06:10.229 --> 00:06:13.189 
in a very very or surreal way that you
can<00:06:10.409> really<00:06:10.620> exploit<00:06:11.190> this<00:06:12.089> gentle<00:06:12.779> blending

00:06:13.189 --> 00:06:13.199 
can really exploit this gentle blending

00:06:13.199 --> 00:06:15.290 
can really exploit this gentle blending
of<00:06:13.319> the<00:06:13.409> colors<00:06:13.440> to<00:06:14.310> create<00:06:14.669> beautiful

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:15.300 
of the colors to create beautiful

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:17.930 
of the colors to create beautiful
effects<00:06:15.889> or<00:06:16.889> incidentally<00:06:17.430> with<00:06:17.580> pen<00:06:17.789> and

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:17.940 
effects or incidentally with pen and
