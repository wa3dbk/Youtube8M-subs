the phone at the bottom so what this

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:27.510 
the phone at the bottom so what this
does<00:02:23.200> it<00:02:23.380> actually<00:02:23.620> takes<00:02:24.070> the<00:02:24.900> speaker<00:02:26.520> sound

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:27.520 
does it actually takes the speaker sound

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.580 
does it actually takes the speaker sound
from<00:02:27.940> the<00:02:28.060> speaker<00:02:28.450> of<00:02:28.690> the<00:02:28.900> phone<00:02:29.110> and<00:02:29.440> it

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
from the speaker of the phone and it

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:35.100 
from the speaker of the phone and it
moves<00:02:30.490> it<00:02:30.610> to<00:02:30.910> the<00:02:32.970> front<00:02:33.970> of<00:02:34.270> the<00:02:34.510> phone<00:02:34.690> so

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
moves it to the front of the phone so

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:36.840 
moves it to the front of the phone so
it's<00:02:35.230> kind<00:02:35.380> of<00:02:35.410> cool<00:02:35.620> it<00:02:35.770> directs<00:02:36.070> it<00:02:36.160> out<00:02:36.280> on

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:36.850 
it's kind of cool it directs it out on

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:39.360 
it's kind of cool it directs it out on
the<00:02:37.000> back<00:02:37.150> of<00:02:37.270> the<00:02:37.360> case<00:02:37.930> you<00:02:38.200> have<00:02:38.440> a<00:02:38.470> the

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
the back of the case you have a the

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:41.550 
the back of the case you have a the
power<00:02:39.610> button<00:02:40.000> here<00:02:40.200> then<00:02:41.200> when<00:02:41.290> you<00:02:41.350> push

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
power button here then when you push

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.470 
power button here then when you push
that<00:02:41.590> there's<00:02:42.100> these<00:02:42.400> LED<00:02:43.000> lights<00:02:43.210> and<00:02:43.360> that

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
that there's these LED lights and that

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.330 
that there's these LED lights and that
goes<00:02:43.600> up<00:02:43.750> to<00:02:43.870> a<00:02:43.900> 1/4<00:02:44.200> light<00:02:44.710> which<00:02:44.920> is<00:02:45.070> not<00:02:45.220> on

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
goes up to a 1/4 light which is not on

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:46.470 
goes up to a 1/4 light which is not on
around<00:02:45.520> these<00:02:45.670> it<00:02:45.760> needs<00:02:45.910> to<00:02:46.000> be<00:02:46.090> charged<00:02:46.360> up

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
around these it needs to be charged up

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.590 
around these it needs to be charged up
to<00:02:46.510> the<00:02:46.660> fourth<00:02:47.760> so<00:02:48.760> if<00:02:48.880> you<00:02:48.970> take<00:02:49.120> the<00:02:49.240> 3100

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:49.600 
to the fourth so if you take the 3100

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.780 
to the fourth so if you take the 3100
divided<00:02:50.110> by<00:02:50.200> 4<00:02:50.560> each<00:02:50.890> light<00:02:51.190> represents

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
divided by 4 each light represents

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:53.730 
divided by 4 each light represents
basically<00:02:51.910> you<00:02:52.480> know<00:02:52.600> quarter<00:02:53.080> amount<00:02:53.650> of

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:53.740 
basically you know quarter amount of

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:55.290 
basically you know quarter amount of
power<00:02:53.980> so<00:02:54.220> you<00:02:54.310> know<00:02:54.400> how<00:02:54.460> much<00:02:54.580> power<00:02:55.120> you

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:55.300 
power so you know how much power you

00:02:55.300 --> 00:03:00.570 
power so you know how much power you
have<00:02:55.330> left<00:02:55.690> and<00:02:57.600> the<00:02:58.600> recharging<00:02:59.170> cable<00:02:59.580> micro

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:00.580 
have left and the recharging cable micro

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:04.260 
have left and the recharging cable micro
USB<00:03:01.000> port<00:03:01.690> is<00:03:01.980> at<00:03:02.980> the<00:03:03.190> bottom<00:03:03.490> here<00:03:03.760> along

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:04.270 
USB port is at the bottom here along

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:06.780 
USB port is at the bottom here along
with<00:03:04.300> the<00:03:05.190> the<00:03:06.190> other<00:03:06.340> thing<00:03:06.430> that<00:03:06.490> comes<00:03:06.640> in

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:06.790 
with the the other thing that comes in

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:09.199 
with the the other thing that comes in
the<00:03:06.880> box<00:03:07.060> is<00:03:07.270> the<00:03:07.530> headphone<00:03:08.530> extender

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:09.209 
the box is the headphone extender

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:13.380 
the box is the headphone extender
because<00:03:10.209> this<00:03:10.630> is<00:03:10.780> so<00:03:10.959> thick<00:03:11.350> right<00:03:12.190> here<00:03:12.390> you

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:13.390 
because this is so thick right here you

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:17.040 
because this is so thick right here you
need<00:03:13.750> to<00:03:14.110> use<00:03:14.470> this<00:03:14.800> to<00:03:15.640> get<00:03:16.480> to<00:03:16.630> your<00:03:16.720> audio

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:17.050 
need to use this to get to your audio

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.970 
need to use this to get to your audio
and<00:03:17.260> then<00:03:17.320> you<00:03:17.410> can<00:03:17.560> plug<00:03:17.709> your<00:03:17.739> headphones

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:17.980 
and then you can plug your headphones

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:20.160 
and then you can plug your headphones
into<00:03:18.250> here<00:03:18.580> and<00:03:19.030> this<00:03:19.150> is<00:03:19.270> pretty<00:03:19.540> typical<00:03:19.840> of

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:20.170 
into here and this is pretty typical of

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:22.110 
into here and this is pretty typical of
all<00:03:20.380> these<00:03:20.530> style<00:03:20.860> cases<00:03:21.310> so<00:03:21.610> either<00:03:21.820> design

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.120 
all these style cases so either design

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.030 
all these style cases so either design
but<00:03:22.750> itself<00:03:23.110> the<00:03:23.200> installation<00:03:23.709> is<00:03:23.770> really

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040

looking it adds very little bulk to the
phone<00:03:45.340> itself<00:03:45.640> I<00:03:45.850> feel<00:03:46.239> it's<00:03:46.989> always<00:03:47.170> a

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:47.380 
phone itself I feel it's always a

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:49.590 
phone itself I feel it's always a
personal<00:03:47.770> preference<00:03:48.250> I<00:03:48.459> like<00:03:49.150> how<00:03:49.330> it<00:03:49.450> feels
