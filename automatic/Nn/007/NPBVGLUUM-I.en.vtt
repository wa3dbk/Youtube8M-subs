he can jump like nobody so that's

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:37.610

pitch for me and he's probably one of
the<00:03:19.890> best<00:03:20.130> players<00:03:20.370> you're<00:03:20.490> going<00:03:20.610> to<00:03:20.670> get<00:03:20.760> on

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
the best players you're going to get on

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:22.400

the game in terms of ordinary players

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:24.380 
the game in terms of ordinary players
I'd<00:03:22.620> go<00:03:22.800> as<00:03:22.890> far<00:03:22.950> as<00:03:23.130> to<00:03:23.280> say<00:03:23.520> he<00:03:23.790> is<00:03:23.940> the<00:03:24.120> best

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
but obviously there's going to be

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:26.990 
but obviously there's going to be
informed<00:03:26.100> on<00:03:26.220> Team<00:03:26.400> of<00:03:26.490> the<00:03:26.520> seasons<00:03:26.880> that
