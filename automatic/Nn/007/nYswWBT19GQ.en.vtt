00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:05.009
 hello friends I'm macho camacho and we're 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.299
 here in the bird news today we come 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.210
 something very important that is the 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.340
 Waste of water 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:13.050
 we will transmit it with my 

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:16.139
 eighth companion towers 

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:19.910
 hi macho camacho how are you 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:22.020
 very good, I'm here for a reason 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:24.480
 I've seen a lot of people lately 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:27.150
 It wastes the water and that bothers me like that 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.340
 I came here to do a story 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.880
 about the resources that we can wash 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.880
 accompany 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:45.830
 hello hello sir how is well well well 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.830
 I could also do an interview 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.100
 ah 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.930
 as a regular link with a bucket 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.490
 when it's worth 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:59.490
 some other action 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:07.550
 There are several ways to use water if 

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:11.360
 let's see it 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:14.120
 and you if you realize what you're 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:18.320
 doing you're wasting the water 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:21.320
 leaving the key open to no because 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:23.330
 good idea psycho while washing 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.910
 the teeth you can use the water that 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:29.740
 are you using to brush your teeth 

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:29.740
 for other utilities how are you 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:38.490
 good idea we can put the used water 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:38.490
 in the toilet as if you throw the string 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.810
 You can also use it to water the 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.810
 plants 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.130
 or put it there for when you need it 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:02:00.760
 That's why nothing 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.760
 I do not know how to use on hold
