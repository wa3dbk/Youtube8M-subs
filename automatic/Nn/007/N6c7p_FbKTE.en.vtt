00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:11.110 
here so I found this box and I thought

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:12.840 
here so I found this box and I thought
it<00:01:11.229> would<00:01:11.290> be<00:01:11.440> really<00:01:11.650> nice<00:01:11.920> to<00:01:11.979> use<00:01:12.340> as<00:01:12.520> a<00:01:12.549> fish

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:12.850 
it would be really nice to use as a fish

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:16.920 
it would be really nice to use as a fish
tank<00:01:13.119> it<00:01:13.560> it<00:01:14.560> just<00:01:14.920> comes<00:01:15.310> over<00:01:16.000> here<00:01:16.329> it's

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:16.930 
tank it it just comes over here it's

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:20.219 
tank it it just comes over here it's
just<00:01:17.200> like<00:01:17.350> it<00:01:17.950> comes<00:01:18.310> off<00:01:18.490> like<00:01:18.670> that<00:01:19.229> nephew

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:20.229 
just like it comes off like that nephew

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:24.959 
just like it comes off like that nephew
and<00:01:20.439> then<00:01:21.039> um<00:01:22.200> so<00:01:23.200> you<00:01:23.770> just<00:01:23.950> pretty<00:01:24.399> much<00:01:24.640> it's

00:01:24.959 --> 00:01:24.969 
and then um so you just pretty much it's

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:28.139 
and then um so you just pretty much it's
easy<00:01:25.299> to<00:01:25.570> make<00:01:25.750> and<00:01:26.079> you<00:01:26.799> can<00:01:26.950> find<00:01:27.189> any<00:01:27.460> box<00:01:27.789> it

00:01:28.139 --> 00:01:28.149 
easy to make and you can find any box it

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:29.819 
easy to make and you can find any box it
doesn't<00:01:28.450> matter<00:01:28.570> as<00:01:28.750> long<00:01:28.780> as<00:01:29.049> it's<00:01:29.200> clear<00:01:29.500> and

00:01:29.819 --> 00:01:29.829 
doesn't matter as long as it's clear and

00:01:29.829 --> 00:01:35.399

00:01:42.029 --> 00:01:42.039 
this and like this and then I glued them

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:45.330 
this and like this and then I glued them
in<00:01:42.249> like<00:01:42.520> this<00:01:42.789> and<00:01:43.270> all<00:01:43.509> sorts<00:01:43.929> of<00:01:43.990> stuff<00:01:44.340> um

00:01:58.749 --> 00:02:02.910 
scenery which would be this right here
and<00:02:00.210> then<00:02:01.210> I<00:02:01.240> found<00:02:01.719> these<00:02:01.990> little<00:02:02.319> like<00:02:02.560> um

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:02.920 
and then I found these little like um

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.840 
and then I found these little like um
phone<00:02:03.640> paper<00:02:04.149> things<00:02:04.539> and<00:02:05.109> I<00:02:05.679> used<00:02:05.950> green<00:02:06.310> SC

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:06.850 
phone paper things and I used green SC

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:09.650 
phone paper things and I used green SC
lead<00:02:07.060> right<00:02:07.509> here<00:02:07.810> and<00:02:08.170> over<00:02:08.590> on<00:02:08.710> the<00:02:08.860> side

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
lead right here and over on the side

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:14.160 
lead right here and over on the side
okay<00:02:10.740> so<00:02:11.850> we<00:02:12.850> just<00:02:13.060> measured<00:02:13.510> some<00:02:13.750> stuff<00:02:14.020> with

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
okay so we just measured some stuff with

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.620 
okay so we just measured some stuff with
a<00:02:14.319> ruler<00:02:14.590> I<00:02:15.220> guess<00:02:15.790> we<00:02:16.000> just<00:02:16.030> had<00:02:16.300> to<00:02:16.330> measure

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:16.630 
a ruler I guess we just had to measure

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:19.080 
a ruler I guess we just had to measure
and<00:02:17.140> stuff<00:02:17.350> and<00:02:17.920> then<00:02:18.310> we<00:02:18.430> used<00:02:18.640> a<00:02:18.790> glue<00:02:19.060> stick

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
and stuff and then we used a glue stick

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:21.990 
and stuff and then we used a glue stick
to<00:02:19.659> just<00:02:19.810> glue<00:02:20.769> the<00:02:20.920> fish<00:02:21.099> on<00:02:21.340> in

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
to just glue the fish on in

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.110 
to just glue the fish on in
um<00:02:22.390> these<00:02:23.350> were<00:02:23.530> stick<00:02:23.800> on<00:02:23.950> so<00:02:24.460> pretty<00:02:25.000> much

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
um these were stick on so pretty much
