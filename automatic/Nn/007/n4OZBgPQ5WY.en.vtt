00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:51.820 
the stock which would take it off of

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:54.000 
the stock which would take it off of
this<00:00:51.940> page<00:00:52.210> you<00:00:52.960> can<00:00:53.079> uninstall<00:00:53.260> it<00:00:53.710> which

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:54.010 
this page you can uninstall it which

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:55.979 
this page you can uninstall it which
would<00:00:54.160> take<00:00:54.310> it<00:00:54.430> off<00:00:54.579> to<00:00:54.730> the<00:00:54.760> computer<00:00:55.360> you

00:00:55.979 --> 00:00:55.989 
would take it off to the computer you

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:57.960 
would take it off to the computer you
can<00:00:56.110> make<00:00:56.230> it<00:00:56.350> smaller<00:00:56.739> but<00:00:57.430> you<00:00:57.489> can<00:00:57.610> turn<00:00:57.850> the

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:57.970 
can make it smaller but you can turn the

00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:59.790 
can make it smaller but you can turn the
live<00:00:58.149> tile<00:00:58.450> off<00:00:58.720> so<00:00:58.960> let's<00:00:59.110> turn<00:00:59.290> a<00:00:59.350> live<00:00:59.559> tile

00:00:59.790 --> 00:00:59.800 
live tile off so let's turn a live tile

live tile off so let's turn a live tile
off<00:01:00.040> on<00:01:00.220> this<00:01:00.370> one<00:01:00.610> so<00:01:01.120> that<00:01:01.270> it's<00:01:01.390> no<00:01:01.510> longer

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:01.540 
off on this one so that it's no longer

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:04.859 
off on this one so that it's no longer
moving<00:01:02.079> and<00:01:02.860> let's<00:01:03.670> take<00:01:03.910> the<00:01:04.119> tile<00:01:04.329> above<00:01:04.509> it

00:01:04.859 --> 00:01:04.869 
moving and let's take the tile above it

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:07.620 
moving and let's take the tile above it
right<00:01:05.770> click<00:01:06.070> on<00:01:06.130> it<00:01:06.399> and<00:01:06.579> let's<00:01:07.299> make<00:01:07.450> it

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:07.630 
right click on it and let's make it

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:11.160 
right click on it and let's make it
smaller<00:01:08.250> it's<00:01:09.250> that<00:01:09.460> simple<00:01:09.689> these<00:01:10.689> tiles<00:01:10.930> can

smaller it's that simple these tiles can

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:12.899 
smaller it's that simple these tiles can
be<00:01:11.229> moved<00:01:11.649> within<00:01:12.159> the<00:01:12.399> sections<00:01:12.790> that
