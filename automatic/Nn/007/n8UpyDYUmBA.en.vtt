00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
over a pot of boiling water whether I

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.840 
over a pot of boiling water whether I
was<00:01:09.810> taking<00:01:10.260> forever<00:01:10.710> singing<00:01:11.220> too<00:01:11.430> long<00:01:11.610> I

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
was taking forever singing too long I

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.179 
was taking forever singing too long I
was<00:01:12.390> gonna<00:01:12.659> put<00:01:12.930> it<00:01:13.049> in<00:01:13.170> a<00:01:13.229> microwave<00:01:13.409> and<00:01:14.010> then

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
was gonna put it in a microwave and then

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.429 
was gonna put it in a microwave and then
at<00:01:14.369> like<00:01:14.549> 10<00:01:14.760> second<00:01:15.119> intervals<00:01:15.210> take<00:01:16.200> it<00:01:16.320> out

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
at like 10 second intervals take it out

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.740 
at like 10 second intervals take it out
and<00:01:16.619> stir<00:01:17.310> it<00:01:17.490> but<00:01:17.700> that<00:01:17.970> seems<00:01:18.000> like<00:01:18.360> way<00:01:18.540> too

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
and stir it but that seems like way too

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.810 
and stir it but that seems like way too
much<00:01:19.020> work<00:01:19.229> so<00:01:19.439> what<00:01:19.590> I<00:01:19.619> ended<00:01:19.920> up<00:01:20.009> doing<00:01:20.070> was

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
much work so what I ended up doing was

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.109 
much work so what I ended up doing was
taking<00:01:21.150> a<00:01:21.380> knife<00:01:22.380> and<00:01:22.409> just<00:01:22.939> scooping<00:01:23.939> out

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
taking a knife and just scooping out

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:25.999 
taking a knife and just scooping out
each<00:01:24.479> foundation<00:01:25.110> and<00:01:25.320> then<00:01:25.530> just<00:01:25.799> scraping

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
each foundation and then just scraping

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.340 
each foundation and then just scraping
it<00:01:26.250> back<00:01:26.460> into<00:01:27.420> this<00:01:27.540> right<00:01:27.720> here<00:01:27.960> and<00:01:28.140> I<00:01:28.290> think

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350

one of the kiss foundations the entire

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.130 
one of the kiss foundations the entire

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140 
thing fit into one well that's how deep

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:21.050 
thing fit into one well that's how deep
it<00:03:19.260> is<00:03:19.349> or<00:03:19.709> you<00:03:20.099> can<00:03:20.129> say<00:03:20.400> that's<00:03:20.640> how<00:03:20.790> little

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
it is or you can say that's how little

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:24.050 
it is or you can say that's how little
you<00:03:21.330> get<00:03:21.540> off<00:03:21.959> the<00:03:22.379> kiss<00:03:22.709> foundation<00:03:23.700> so<00:03:23.909> if

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
you get off the kiss foundation so if

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.570 
you get off the kiss foundation so if
you<00:03:24.180> want<00:03:24.450> it<00:03:24.540> a<00:03:24.750> lot<00:03:25.709> more<00:03:26.099> you<00:03:26.430> could

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:26.580 
you want it a lot more you could

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:29.059 
you want it a lot more you could
probably<00:03:26.760> go<00:03:27.000> with<00:03:27.150> the<00:03:27.209> Mac<00:03:27.510> the<00:03:27.870> pause<00:03:28.830> in

00:03:29.059 --> 00:03:29.069 
probably go with the Mac the pause in

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:31.039 
probably go with the Mac the pause in
our<00:03:29.159> concealer<00:03:29.640> though<00:03:29.970> it<00:03:30.180> was<00:03:30.299> only<00:03:30.450> half<00:03:30.900> of

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:31.049 
our concealer though it was only half of

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:32.330 
our concealer though it was only half of
the<00:03:31.170> jar<00:03:31.409> that<00:03:31.560> I<00:03:31.590> ended<00:03:31.769> up<00:03:31.799> using<00:03:31.980> and<00:03:32.280> the

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
the jar that I ended up using and the

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.220 
the jar that I ended up using and the
positive<00:03:32.640> concealer<00:03:33.000> cost<00:03:33.209> seven<00:03:33.540> dollars<00:03:33.810> so

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
positive concealer cost seven dollars so

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:35.300 
positive concealer cost seven dollars so
if<00:03:34.290> you<00:03:34.379> want<00:03:34.530> to<00:03:34.590> go<00:03:34.650> in<00:03:34.739> prospects<00:03:35.099> and<00:03:35.190> say
