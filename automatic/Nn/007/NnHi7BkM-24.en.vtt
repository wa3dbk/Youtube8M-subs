prefer<00:02:37.460> the<00:02:37.760> layout<00:02:38.060> on<00:02:38.270> this<00:02:38.480> one<00:02:38.690> it's<00:02:38.900> like

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:39.020 
prefer the layout on this one it's like

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.830 
prefer the layout on this one it's like
actually<00:02:39.740> quite<00:02:39.980> brighter<00:02:40.280> and<00:02:40.760> it's<00:02:41.570> on<00:02:41.720> the

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
actually quite brighter and it's on the

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.540 
actually quite brighter and it's on the
default<00:02:42.170> brightness<00:02:42.380> too<00:02:42.830> so<00:02:43.220> it's<00:02:43.400> quite

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:43.550 
default brightness too so it's quite

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:50.199 
default brightness too so it's quite
surprising<00:02:45.700> but<00:02:46.700> yeah<00:02:46.940> so<00:02:48.010> we<00:02:49.010> try<00:02:49.880> something

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:50.209 
surprising but yeah so we try something

00:02:50.209 --> 00:03:03.630 
surprising but yeah so we try something
else<00:02:51.040> let's<00:02:52.040> try<00:02:55.510> website<00:02:56.510> like<00:02:57.550> CNN<00:03:01.360> and

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:03.640 
else let's try website like CNN and

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:06.820 
else let's try website like CNN and
there<00:03:04.640> we<00:03:04.820> are<00:03:04.850> I<00:03:05.330> can't<00:03:05.990> really<00:03:06.230> tell<00:03:06.530> life

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:06.830 
there we are I can't really tell life

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:12.810 
there we are I can't really tell life
and<00:03:07.100> that<00:03:07.190> was<00:03:07.280> a<00:03:07.310> draw<00:03:09.730> right<00:03:10.730> so<00:03:11.060> this<00:03:11.480> one's

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:12.820 
and that was a draw right so this one's

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:16.690 
and that was a draw right so this one's
this<00:03:13.820> one<00:03:14.030> took<00:03:14.870> quite<00:03:15.500> a<00:03:15.560> long<00:03:15.650> time<00:03:16.160> to<00:03:16.520> be

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:16.700 
this one took quite a long time to be

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:20.949
