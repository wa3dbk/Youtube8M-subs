team<00:01:28.049> you<00:01:28.590> just<00:01:28.770> need<00:01:28.890> that<00:01:28.920> first<00:01:29.310> turn<00:01:29.520> to<00:01:29.549> go

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
team you just need that first turn to go

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.240 
team you just need that first turn to go
right<00:01:30.030> and<00:01:30.350> then<00:01:31.350> you<00:01:31.530> just<00:01:31.770> get<00:01:31.920> in<00:01:32.100> that

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
right and then you just get in that

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.910 
right and then you just get in that
cycle<00:01:32.700> so<00:01:32.909> that's<00:01:33.450> gonna<00:01:33.630> be<00:01:33.810> ice<00:01:33.960> shard<00:01:34.290> we're

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
cycle so that's gonna be ice shard we're

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.740 
cycle so that's gonna be ice shard we're
gong<00:01:35.070> to<00:01:35.100> goes<00:01:35.400> down<00:01:35.579> before<00:01:35.759> can<00:01:36.150> do<00:01:36.479> any

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
gong to goes down before can do any

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:37.850 
gong to goes down before can do any
damage<00:01:37.020> to<00:01:37.170> the<00:01:37.350> team

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
damage to the team

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.710

Venusaur<00:01:38.520> is<00:01:38.790> going<00:01:39.119> to<00:01:39.210> have<00:01:39.360> to<00:01:39.570> do

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
Venusaur is going to have to do

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.440 
Venusaur is going to have to do
something<00:01:40.729> he's<00:01:41.729> gonna<00:01:41.909> leave<00:01:42.119> Shi'ite<00:01:42.329> Iran

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
something he's gonna leave Shi'ite Iran

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.560 
something he's gonna leave Shi'ite Iran
but<00:01:42.899> it's<00:01:43.560> it's<00:01:44.549> going<00:01:44.759> to<00:01:44.880> be<00:01:44.970> enough<00:01:45.270> or

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
but it's it's going to be enough or

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.389 
but it's it's going to be enough or
actually<00:01:46.049> it's<00:01:46.500> not<00:01:46.680> gonna<00:01:46.799> be<00:01:46.950> enough<00:01:47.040> when

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
actually it's not gonna be enough when

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.039 
actually it's not gonna be enough when
you<00:01:47.490> break<00:01:47.700> it<00:01:47.820> down<00:01:47.850> because<00:01:48.180> he<00:01:48.509> didn't<00:01:48.930> take

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
you break it down because he didn't take

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.469 
you break it down because he didn't take
damage<00:01:49.250> technically<00:01:50.250> a<00:01:50.280> sturdy<00:01:50.610> didn't<00:01:51.000> proc

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
damage technically a sturdy didn't proc

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.300 
damage technically a sturdy didn't proc
but<00:01:52.020> he's<00:01:52.290> not<00:01:52.439> going<00:01:52.619> to<00:01:52.770> get<00:01:52.950> knocked<00:01:53.100> out<00:01:53.220> by

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
but he's not going to get knocked out by

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.340 
but he's not going to get knocked out by
leech<00:01:53.610> seed<00:01:53.790> because<00:01:53.970> its<00:01:54.119> percent<00:01:54.540> health<00:01:54.780> so

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
leech seed because its percent health so

venusaur<00:01:55.710> is<00:01:55.799> still<00:01:56.070> very<00:01:56.219> vulnerable<00:01:56.520> to<00:01:56.969> the

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
venusaur is still very vulnerable to the

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.840 
venusaur is still very vulnerable to the
ice<00:01:57.299> shard<00:01:57.689> and<00:01:57.960> then<00:01:58.530> wall<00:01:58.799> rain<00:01:59.009> is<00:01:59.369> pretty

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
ice shard and then wall rain is pretty

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.219 
ice shard and then wall rain is pretty
much<00:01:59.969> it's<00:02:00.149> gonna<00:02:00.270> be<00:02:00.360> alone<00:02:00.600> at<00:02:00.869> the<00:02:01.020> end<00:02:01.140> of

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
much it's gonna be alone at the end of

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:04.760 
much it's gonna be alone at the end of
this<00:02:01.350> so<00:02:02.070> it<00:02:02.460> would<00:02:02.939> protect<00:02:03.439> nice<00:02:04.439> little

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
this so it would protect nice little

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.709 
this so it would protect nice little
interesting<00:02:05.250> bit<00:02:05.430> of<00:02:05.460> tech<00:02:06.090> right<00:02:06.360> there<00:02:06.570> to

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
interesting bit of tech right there to

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.540 
interesting bit of tech right there to

just kind of still out the opponent a

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:09.979 
just kind of still out the opponent a
little<00:02:08.610> more<00:02:09.090> and<00:02:09.330> it's<00:02:09.479> gonna<00:02:09.660> be<00:02:09.780> the<00:02:09.869> ice

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
little more and it's gonna be the ice

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.199 
little more and it's gonna be the ice
shard<00:02:10.500> so<00:02:10.739> once<00:02:11.310> you<00:02:11.400> get<00:02:11.520> that<00:02:11.640> cycle<00:02:12.030> going

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
OH critical hit and that's going to be

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:43.320 
OH critical hit and that's going to be
the<00:02:40.209> ko<00:02:40.570> right<00:02:41.110> there<00:02:41.459> but<00:02:42.459> Aaron's<00:02:42.970> still<00:02:43.209> in

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:43.330 
the ko right there but Aaron's still in

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:46.170 
the ko right there but Aaron's still in
the<00:02:43.390> field<00:02:43.600> so<00:02:44.280> that's<00:02:45.280> the<00:02:45.580> power<00:02:45.790> right

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
the field so that's the power right

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.030 
the field so that's the power right
there<00:02:46.209> of<00:02:46.900> fear<00:02:47.290> and<00:02:47.380> doable<00:02:47.650> so<00:02:47.740> I<00:02:47.920> was

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
there of fear and doable so I was

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.190 
there of fear and doable so I was
actually<00:02:48.220> I<00:02:48.550> was<00:02:48.610> a<00:02:48.790> bit<00:02:48.880> nervous<00:02:49.150> I<00:02:49.780> was

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
actually I was a bit nervous I was

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.110 
actually I was a bit nervous I was
wondering<00:02:50.500> like<00:02:50.530> okay<00:02:50.920> um<00:02:51.160> what<00:02:52.000> are<00:02:52.030> you

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
wondering like okay um what are you

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:53.310 
wondering like okay um what are you
going<00:02:52.239> to<00:02:52.330> do<00:02:52.480> when<00:02:52.630> you<00:02:52.690> have<00:02:52.720> to<00:02:52.900> focus<00:02:53.110> on

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:53.320 
going to do when you have to focus on

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:54.870 
going to do when you have to focus on
hitting<00:02:53.590> you<00:02:53.739> when<00:02:54.220> you<00:02:54.310> play<00:02:54.520> it<00:02:54.640> up<00:02:54.760> with

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:54.880 
hitting you when you play it up with

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:56.520 
hitting you when you play it up with
that<00:02:54.970> priority<00:02:55.450> it<00:02:55.810> actually<00:02:56.110> doesn't<00:02:56.290> happen

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
that priority it actually doesn't happen

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:58.590 
that priority it actually doesn't happen
like<00:02:56.830> that<00:02:56.890> which<00:02:57.250> is<00:02:57.280> pretty<00:02:57.400> nice<00:02:57.850> now<00:02:58.360> also

00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:58.600 
like that which is pretty nice now also

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.810 
like that which is pretty nice now also
this<00:02:59.050> is<00:02:59.260> a<00:02:59.560> little<00:02:59.739> reminiscent<00:03:00.400> of<00:03:00.670> my

this is a little reminiscent of my
Keyblade<00:03:01.209> combo<00:03:01.630> not<00:03:02.080> because<00:03:02.290> it<00:03:02.410> was<00:03:02.500> fear

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:02.709 
Keyblade combo not because it was fear

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:04.410 
Keyblade combo not because it was fear
or<00:03:02.830> anything<00:03:02.980> but<00:03:03.520> once<00:03:03.790> you<00:03:03.940> get<00:03:04.150> in<00:03:04.270> that

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.420 
or anything but once you get in that

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:06.210 
or anything but once you get in that
loop<00:03:04.690> once<00:03:05.050> you<00:03:05.140> have<00:03:05.320> that<00:03:05.530> turn<00:03:05.739> advantage

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:06.220 
loop once you have that turn advantage

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:07.199 
loop once you have that turn advantage
to<00:03:06.340> where<00:03:06.459> you're<00:03:06.550> just<00:03:06.700> playing<00:03:06.970> off<00:03:07.180> the

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:07.209 
to where you're just playing off the

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:09.000 
to where you're just playing off the
last<00:03:07.540> turn<00:03:07.810> really<00:03:08.050> well<00:03:08.140> and<00:03:08.440> you're<00:03:08.800> getting

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010 
last turn really well and you're getting

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:09.840 
last turn really well and you're getting
a<00:03:09.160> cycle<00:03:09.520> going

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:09.850 
a cycle going

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:11.699 
a cycle going
I<00:03:10.030> don't<00:03:10.660> really<00:03:10.750> can't<00:03:11.050> do<00:03:11.170> anything<00:03:11.440> about

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:11.709 
I don't really can't do anything about

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:13.830 
I don't really can't do anything about
that<00:03:11.860> now<00:03:12.280> fake<00:03:12.910> out<00:03:13.120> and<00:03:13.360> protect<00:03:13.690> our

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 
that now fake out and protect our

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.990 
that now fake out and protect our
players<00:03:14.050> might<00:03:14.590> affect<00:03:15.520> it<00:03:15.610> but<00:03:15.790> if<00:03:15.880> you're

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 
players might affect it but if you're

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.280 
players might affect it but if you're
just<00:03:16.150> playing<00:03:16.270> really<00:03:16.570> smart<00:03:16.930> about<00:03:17.080> it

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.290 
just playing really smart about it

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:18.660 
just playing really smart about it
it<00:03:17.560> looks<00:03:17.739> like<00:03:17.860> you<00:03:17.950> can<00:03:18.100> do<00:03:18.220> the<00:03:18.340> right<00:03:18.459> thing

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:18.670 
it looks like you can do the right thing

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:21.210
