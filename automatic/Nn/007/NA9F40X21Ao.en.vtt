00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:10.450
 without water there is no life and the sources of water 

00:00:08.709 --> 00:00:12.250
 world's clean is running out 

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:14.380
 according to the UN, if we continue 

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:17.349
 consuming this resource without awareness 

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:19.029
 world's water supply will fall 40 per 

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:21.009
 one hundred by 2030 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:25.079
 now that the water crisis has to do with 

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:25.079
 these beautiful flowers you discover now 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:43.080
 we are in the city ​​tutti fiore in erechim 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:46.290
 in rio grande do sul ac a flávio marcos 

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:49.340
 8 thousand square meters of flowers 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:49.340
 using rainwater 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.340
 the flowers came into our lives for 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.110
 cause of sebrae in 2007 was 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.440
 happening a project that called 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:03.540
 together to compete was to promote 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:07.920
 flower production in the region 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:11.490
 This was March in August we were 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:14.220
 with this the first greenhouse was ready 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.800
 how does this system of abstraction and 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.630
 rain storage is alright 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:20.190
 simple and we took advantage 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.670
 really the resources that we had 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:26.910
 rainwater falls on the property. 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:30.900
 coverage is collected by the 

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:33.750
 gutters goes down the plumbing and 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:37.410
 storage tank and this was 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:41.280
 the first one we built was oo 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:41.880
 principle of the heart of the site is 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.150
 fuck 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:47.010
 that we organized in such a way that 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:49.950
 that last tank we saw 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:51.990
 covered it was the first it is the level 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.360
 lower then all others 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:57.090
 pour water on it by gravity 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:01.680
 in it we have a pump installed that 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:03.900
 water, this water comes from this box. 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.450
 goes to the greenhouses by gravity 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:09.090
 so we decreased the 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:12.090
 consumption of electricity because the 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:14.640
 People only use the electric power at the pump. 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:17.220
 Once for the repression here. 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.739
 and hence it is that all the 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.660
 greenhouses receive water in addition to 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:23.250
 worry about water and enjoy 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:25.620
 a lot of things around here 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:28.290
 cattle manure for example is 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.590
 used to complement the adult of the 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:33.260
 plants 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:35.030
 everything here is reusable so this 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:37.010
 branches leaves leaves are all 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:39.230
 that this goes for a 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:42.110
 composting that after three 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:45.230
 months decomposing there is used back 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:46.610
 in the greenhouses as fertilizers, we also 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:49.250
 we have the question of the packaging bags 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:51.830
 that they are biodegradable 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:52.610
 I think all this adds value to your 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:54.530
 product 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:56.780
 We realize this by the customer who 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:59.060
 always buying our product and a 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:02.030
 customer who is satisfied and does not return 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:04.849
 to buy because it has less quantities 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:07.420
 in the chemical and mineral plant 

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:09.739
 she has a long longer life 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:11.720
 they decreased the amount of 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:14.030
 pesticides replaced by products 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:16.579
 biological processes and also control the 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:18.860
 of mites that are a real plague 

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:22.849
 for flowers introducing a predator 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:25.099
 in the plantation is a mite that 

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:27.799
 fight another here that it feeds 

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:30.590
 and does not make the mite that is 

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:32.569
 which causes the problem in the culture and he 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:33.980
 multiply will spread natural 

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:36.230
 in culture 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:38.810
 besides the acre we have natural baits 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:41.630
 that you can see there are the 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:42.290
 question of the mining fly trips the fly 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:45.049
 white 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:47.870
 they attract there are those who enter the culture 

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:49.970
 and they are stuck by the glue in the field 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:52.250
 where the natural control of it is made right 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:55.430
 for you it must be very good, it 's okay 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:58.190
 rewarding because reducing consumption 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:04:00.169
 of chemicals 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:02.269
 It's not only good for me. 

00:04:00.169 --> 00:04:05.410
 purchase of the population that 

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:05.410
 receive this product 

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:11.230
 the fábio we're here on the side of a 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:13.480
 spring is the privilege of the spring 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:15.730
 It's not like this spring. 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:18.039
 we seek to preserve it from the best 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:22.180
 the way we can to keep the 

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:25.300
 quality water and this water that was already 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:26.740
 used by my mother's mother 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:29.650
 I think that comes from there environmental awareness 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:31.060
 What you have today very much comes from 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:32.710
 my family 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:34.990
 were simple measures that were 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:38.800
 happening that people can have in the 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:40.990
 their day to day in your company at work 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:42.669
 small actions that can change the planet 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:45.039
 changed our lives 

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:46.840
 history gives everything and shows us that 

00:04:45.039 --> 00:04:47.860
 water does not depend on the type of 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:49.960

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:53.410
