careful to you know through her any
stories<00:00:20.430> because<00:00:20.939> I<00:00:21.270> certainly<00:00:22.020> lived<00:00:22.350> in<00:00:22.470> a

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
stories because I certainly lived in a

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.939 
stories because I certainly lived in a
glass<00:00:22.740> house<00:00:23.010> for<00:00:24.619> Wow

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
glass house for Wow

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.419 
glass house for Wow
so<00:00:26.670> I<00:00:27.289> mean<00:00:28.289> it's<00:00:28.410> been<00:00:28.590> interesting<00:00:28.830> to<00:00:29.130> me

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
so I mean it's been interesting to me

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.970 
so I mean it's been interesting to me
just<00:00:29.789> to<00:00:30.240> you<00:00:30.779> know<00:00:30.900> obviously<00:00:31.650> there's<00:00:31.859> a<00:00:31.890> lot

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
just to you know obviously there's a lot

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:38.780 
just to you know obviously there's a lot
of<00:00:32.870> hypocrisy<00:00:34.010> involved<00:00:35.010> and<00:00:35.989> a<00:00:36.989> lot<00:00:37.649> of<00:00:37.790> kind

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
of hypocrisy involved and a lot of kind

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.290 
of hypocrisy involved and a lot of kind
of<00:00:38.879> blame<00:00:39.329> game<00:00:39.719> that's<00:00:40.170> that's<00:00:40.649> played<00:00:41.270> but<00:00:42.270> I

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
of blame game that's that's played but I

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.639 
of blame game that's that's played but I
think<00:00:42.540> to<00:00:42.690> me<00:00:42.870> it's<00:00:43.050> a<00:00:43.230> more<00:00:43.440> interesting

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
think to me it's a more interesting

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.389 
think to me it's a more interesting
thing<00:00:44.190> in<00:00:44.370> America<00:00:44.460> of<00:00:45.000> imagining<00:00:46.399> America

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
thing in America of imagining America

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.220 
thing in America of imagining America
likes<00:00:48.090> to<00:00:48.329> think<00:00:48.420> of<00:00:48.539> itself<00:00:48.629> as<00:00:48.930> being<00:00:49.140> a

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
likes to think of itself as being a

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.270 
likes to think of itself as being a
classless<00:00:49.500> society<00:00:50.300> and<00:00:51.300> I<00:00:51.360> think<00:00:52.190> you<00:00:53.190> know

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
classless society and I think you know

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.850 
classless society and I think you know
race<00:00:53.489> and<00:00:53.760> class<00:00:53.850> relief<00:00:54.360> you<00:00:55.289> know<00:00:55.410> intersect

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
race and class relief you know intersect

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.240 
race and class relief you know intersect
in<00:00:56.039> America<00:00:56.520> and<00:00:57.170> so<00:00:58.170> I<00:00:58.410> think<00:00:58.680> it's<00:00:58.859> less

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
in America and so I think it's less

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.939 
in America and so I think it's less
about<00:00:59.280> race<00:01:00.090> that<00:01:00.570> I<00:01:00.840> think<00:01:01.350> the<00:01:01.500> problem<00:01:01.829> is

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
about race that I think the problem is

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.960 
about race that I think the problem is
but<00:01:02.100> more<00:01:02.430> about<00:01:02.699> an<00:01:02.940> elite<00:01:04.189> class<00:01:05.189> in<00:01:05.580> America

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
but more about an elite class in America

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.609 
but more about an elite class in America
who've<00:01:06.180> been<00:01:06.450> whose<00:01:07.260> needs<00:01:07.439> have<00:01:07.590> been

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
who've been whose needs have been

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:13.070 
who've been whose needs have been
privileged<00:01:08.159> for<00:01:08.970> too<00:01:09.119> long<00:01:09.299> and<00:01:09.740> and<00:01:11.390> that<00:01:12.390> has

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
privileged for too long and and that has

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.260 
privileged for too long and and that has
sort<00:01:13.229> of<00:01:13.320> led<00:01:13.650> the<00:01:14.280> country<00:01:14.640> into<00:01:14.909> you<00:01:15.180> know

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
sort of led the country into you know

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:23.600 
sort of led the country into you know
it's<00:01:15.619> difficult<00:01:17.330> difficult<00:01:18.330> times<00:01:18.810> but<00:01:19.350> I<00:01:22.610> did

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
it's difficult difficult times but I did

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.749 
it's difficult difficult times but I did
notice<00:01:24.030> that<00:01:24.229> as<00:01:25.229> an<00:01:25.560> undergraduate<00:01:26.009> I<00:01:26.460> was<00:01:26.700> a

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
notice that as an undergraduate I was a

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.520 
notice that as an undergraduate I was a
member<00:01:27.299> of<00:01:27.479> the<00:01:27.570> African<00:01:27.810> Students

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
member of the African Students

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.260 
member of the African Students
Association<00:01:28.829> and<00:01:30.740> there<00:01:31.740> was<00:01:31.829> a<00:01:31.860> very<00:01:32.270> strange

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
Association and there was a very strange

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.730 
Association and there was a very strange
relationship<00:01:33.600> between<00:01:34.170> the<00:01:34.409> African

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
relationship between the African

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.609 
relationship between the African
American<00:01:35.189> student<00:01:35.930> associations<00:01:36.930> and<00:01:37.229> the

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
American student associations and the

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.069 
American student associations and the
African<00:01:38.070> student<00:01:38.369> associations<00:01:39.030> and<00:01:39.420> the

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
African student associations and the

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.520 
African student associations and the
strange<00:01:40.680> kind<00:01:41.189> of<00:01:41.400> I<00:01:41.880> think<00:01:42.659> each<00:01:42.960> was

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
strange kind of I think each was

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.069 
strange kind of I think each was
threatened<00:01:44.009> by<00:01:44.220> the<00:01:44.280> other<00:01:44.549> and<00:01:44.939> the<00:01:45.689> African

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
threatened by the other and the African

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.490 
threatened by the other and the African
American<00:01:46.409> so<00:01:46.619> threatened<00:01:47.100> by<00:01:47.189> this

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:48.500 
American so threatened by this

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.139 
American so threatened by this
questioning<00:01:49.500> of<00:01:49.619> their<00:01:49.799> own<00:01:49.979> or<00:01:50.220> theta-c<00:01:50.880> by

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
know sort of vice versa and so that was

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.399 
know sort of vice versa and so that was
just<00:01:56.100> an<00:01:56.250> interesting<00:01:56.750> sort<00:01:57.750> of<00:01:57.780> dynamic<00:01:58.259> that

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
just an interesting sort of dynamic that

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.149 
just an interesting sort of dynamic that
