I'm not sure what it does on bosses but
I<00:00:40.410> know<00:00:40.530> in<00:00:41.010> the<00:00:41.160> first<00:00:41.430> game<00:00:41.760> one<00:00:42.210> shot<00:00:42.480> just

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
I know in the first game one shot just

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.869 
I know in the first game one shot just
like<00:00:42.899> completely<00:00:43.140> murdered<00:00:43.739> the<00:00:43.860> boss<00:00:44.010> or<00:00:44.250> two

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
like completely murdered the boss or two

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.970 
like completely murdered the boss or two
shots<00:00:45.180> depending<00:00:45.450> on<00:00:45.690> who<00:00:45.809> it<00:00:45.930> was<00:00:46.110> yeah

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
shots depending on who it was yeah

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.500

hopefully<00:00:47.250> that<00:00:47.520> carries<00:00:47.850> over<00:00:47.879> because<00:00:48.329> that

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
hopefully that carries over because that

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:49.970 
hopefully that carries over because that
would<00:00:48.600> make<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:48.870> game<00:00:49.020> a<00:00:49.170> lot<00:00:49.410> quicker<00:00:49.649> since

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
would make the game a lot quicker since

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.830 
would make the game a lot quicker since
I<00:00:50.129> have<00:00:50.250> already<00:00:50.520> ran<00:00:50.730> through<00:00:50.940> it<00:00:50.969> twice<00:00:51.270> now

for the Mega Man X armor you have to

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.119 
for the Mega Man X armor you have to
beat<00:00:54.480> the<00:00:54.570> game<00:00:54.750> on<00:00:54.780> normal<00:00:55.379> and<00:00:55.559> for<00:00:56.010> the

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
beat the game on normal and for the

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:57.740 
beat the game on normal and for the
Buster<00:00:56.550> you<00:00:56.640> have<00:00:56.760> to<00:00:56.820> beat<00:00:56.940> on<00:00:57.149> nightmare<00:00:57.539> I

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
Buster you have to beat on nightmare I

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.470 
Buster you have to beat on nightmare I
did<00:00:58.289> both<00:00:58.530> of<00:00:58.710> those<00:00:58.770> in<00:00:59.010> like<00:00:59.190> four<00:00:59.879> days<00:01:00.180> I

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
did both of those in like four days I

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.139 
did both of those in like four days I
think<00:01:00.809> it<00:01:01.410> takes<00:01:01.620> a<00:01:01.739> while<00:01:01.920> not<00:01:02.640> too<00:01:02.910> long

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
think it takes a while not too long

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:04.369 
think it takes a while not too long
though<00:01:03.329> if<00:01:03.420> you<00:01:03.510> devote<00:01:03.750> enough<00:01:03.899> time<00:01:03.960> to<00:01:04.260> it

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
though if you devote enough time to it

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.260 
though if you devote enough time to it
so<00:01:04.769> yeah<00:01:04.979> that's<00:01:05.250> the<00:01:05.489> Mega<00:01:05.760> Buster<00:01:05.939> right

bass<00:03:10.360> would<00:03:10.540> be<00:03:10.660> pretty<00:03:10.870> cool<00:03:11.049> have<00:03:11.680> his<00:03:11.890> nice

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.250 
bass would be pretty cool have his nice

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:13.849 
bass would be pretty cool have his nice
black<00:03:12.609> armor<00:03:12.940> there<00:03:13.120> with<00:03:13.329> the

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:13.859

black armor there with the
multi-directional<00:03:14.859> Buster<00:03:15.790> shots<00:03:16.060> which<00:03:16.329> I

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:16.480 
multi-directional Buster shots which I

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:17.729 
multi-directional Buster shots which I
guess<00:03:16.630> doesn't<00:03:16.900> apply<00:03:17.170> here<00:03:17.260> because<00:03:17.560> you<00:03:17.620> can

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:17.739 
guess doesn't apply here because you can

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:20.910 
guess doesn't apply here because you can
do<00:03:17.799> that<00:03:17.950> anyway<00:03:18.310> and<00:03:19.470> he<00:03:20.470> would<00:03:20.620> be<00:03:20.709> pretty

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:20.920 
do that anyway and he would be pretty

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:21.210 
do that anyway and he would be pretty
sweet

along with treble fan get that along too

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:25.319 
along with treble fan get that along too
not<00:03:24.220> sure<00:03:24.340> how<00:03:24.430> they'd<00:03:24.579> work<00:03:24.820> that<00:03:25.030> in<00:03:25.150> there

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:25.329 
not sure how they'd work that in there

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:27.330 
not sure how they'd work that in there
maybe<00:03:25.510> with<00:03:25.690> the<00:03:25.840> century<00:03:26.560> cat<00:03:26.829> like<00:03:27.040> fairies

maybe with the century cat like fairies

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:29.160 
maybe with the century cat like fairies
in<00:03:27.459> this<00:03:27.609> game<00:03:27.790> you<00:03:28.390> can<00:03:28.420> make<00:03:28.600> a<00:03:28.630> little<00:03:28.870> robot

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:30.820 
kitty runs around attacks people it's

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:31.680

pretty funny

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:33.180 
pretty funny
so<00:03:31.989> speaking<00:03:32.290> of<00:03:32.410> combo<00:03:32.739> weapons<00:03:33.010> like<00:03:33.160> that

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:33.190 
so speaking of combo weapons like that

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:35.069 
so speaking of combo weapons like that
I'm<00:03:33.609> going<00:03:34.000> to<00:03:34.090> make<00:03:34.239> a<00:03:34.269> video<00:03:34.510> at<00:03:34.630> some<00:03:34.840> point

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:35.079 
I'm going to make a video at some point

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:37.440 
I'm going to make a video at some point
I'm<00:03:35.200> not<00:03:35.230> sure<00:03:35.410> when<00:03:35.829> I<00:03:36.160> just<00:03:36.640> bought<00:03:36.850> rise<00:03:37.120> as

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:37.450 
I'm not sure when I just bought rise as

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:39.270 
I'm not sure when I just bought rise as
well<00:03:37.630> so<00:03:37.959> I'll<00:03:38.200> probably<00:03:38.590> make<00:03:38.859> some<00:03:38.980> videos

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 
well so I'll probably make some videos

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:40.920 
well so I'll probably make some videos
in<00:03:39.310> that<00:03:39.519> definitely<00:03:39.850> do<00:03:40.120> a<00:03:40.150> gladiator<00:03:40.690> video

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:40.930 
in that definitely do a gladiator video

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:43.229 
in that definitely do a gladiator video
maybe<00:03:41.170> some<00:03:41.380> story<00:03:41.739> while<00:03:41.980> I'm<00:03:42.069> at<00:03:42.160> it<00:03:42.190> too<00:03:42.459> so

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:43.239 
maybe some story while I'm at it too so

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:45.479 
maybe some story while I'm at it too so
look<00:03:43.540> forward<00:03:43.750> to<00:03:43.840> that<00:03:44.049> and<00:03:44.260> then<00:03:44.859> I<00:03:45.190> will

00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:45.489 
look forward to that and then I will

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:47.160 
look forward to that and then I will
probably<00:03:45.730> come<00:03:46.000> back<00:03:46.030> and<00:03:46.209> do<00:03:46.480> a<00:03:46.510> combo<00:03:46.900> weapon

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:47.170 
probably come back and do a combo weapon

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:49.740 
probably come back and do a combo weapon
video<00:03:47.410> because<00:03:47.859> I<00:03:48.040> have<00:03:48.160> all<00:03:48.340> 105<00:03:49.180> blueprints

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:49.750 
video because I have all 105 blueprints

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:50.819 
video because I have all 105 blueprints
for<00:03:49.840> the<00:03:49.930> combo<00:03:50.230> weapons<00:03:50.530> in<00:03:50.620> this<00:03:50.739> game

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:50.829 
for the combo weapons in this game

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:53.910 
for the combo weapons in this game
pretty<00:03:51.700> sweet<00:03:52.030> weapons<00:03:52.359> all<00:03:52.540> of<00:03:52.810> them<00:03:52.959> pretty

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:53.920 
pretty sweet weapons all of them pretty

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:57.240 
pretty sweet weapons all of them pretty
cool<00:03:54.130> stuff<00:03:54.340> there<00:03:54.519> and<00:03:55.470> then<00:03:56.470> I<00:03:56.650> will<00:03:56.829> most

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.250 
cool stuff there and then I will most

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:59.520 
cool stuff there and then I will most
likely<00:03:57.430> come<00:03:57.790> back<00:03:57.940> again<00:03:58.299> and<00:03:58.569> do<00:03:58.959> a<00:03:58.989> combo

00:03:59.520 --> 00:03:59.530 
likely come back again and do a combo

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:01.259 
likely come back again and do a combo
vehicle<00:03:59.950> 1<00:04:00.100> they're<00:04:00.519> actually<00:04:00.880> a<00:04:00.910> lot<00:04:01.090> less

00:04:01.259 --> 00:04:01.269 
vehicle 1 they're actually a lot less

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:02.970 
vehicle 1 they're actually a lot less
combo<00:04:01.630> vehicles<00:04:02.049> than<00:04:02.200> weapons<00:04:02.530> so<00:04:02.709> that

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:02.980 
combo vehicles than weapons so that

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:04.650 
combo vehicles than weapons so that
video<00:04:03.250> will<00:04:03.370> be<00:04:03.489> much<00:04:03.760> easier<00:04:03.790> to<00:04:04.209> make<00:04:04.359> that

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:04.660 
video will be much easier to make that

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:06.120 
video will be much easier to make that
one<00:04:05.109> might<00:04:05.230> actually<00:04:05.380> come<00:04:05.620> first<00:04:05.859> I'm<00:04:06.040> not

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:06.130 
one might actually come first I'm not
