00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 hello friends with you as always old 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.609
 Good creativity to communicate has not yet reached 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.109
 not without reason all because most recently 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:09.269
 literally here a few hours ago 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.429
 ended the presentation you were waiting for 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.799
 millions of gamers zadrotov and simple 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:18.060
 mortals from around the world today showed 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:19.080
 finally the new xbox one 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.420
 he is called and 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.869
 along with this the presentations were supposed to 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:27.300
 show also to new witch someone in dyuti 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.150
 the voice is called but it is not for me 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.560
 so you care how worried 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:32.250
 information that day along with this 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.440
 had to 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.469
 leaked information must show 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.969
 there were videos on the new hi-fi 14 but 

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:41.790
 naturally as the presentation was 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:44.190
 Xboxbox is dedicated to percent 90 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.649
 actually about him and crackled in the end 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:49.280
 Pro but we FIFU showed information with 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:52.739
 gulkin nose and i will try you 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:55.789
 show the video that was presented 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:58.739
 us and multimillion audience 

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:59.670
 own try something from 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.250
 this extract 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.500
 and the first news that caused the shaft in 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.229
 the audience hall was andy information 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.659
 for lovers of May 9, that is now fifa 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:12.570
 ultimate team who wants to play it 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:15.570
 then you have to buy a new xbox 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.040
 roofing felts I'm old i still not 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.640
 understood but nevertheless in fifa ultimate 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.100
 team 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.170
 Now will be exclusive only on EX 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.850
 boxing and when people swing let such 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.560
 crazy movie uncle iz i 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.840
 I use still provided us with a video 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.979
 in which he showed the new engine 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.829
 engine which will be in my opinion 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:34.480
 used in next-gen consoles 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:35.860
 called he and ignite and 

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:37.450
 Ignat it translates as 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:39.550
 igniting something like that but 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:42.100
 no meaning in this word 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:44.530
 I do not feel that there is no 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:47.350
 connections between this table and the future 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:49.270
 video I somehow did not see in the video were 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:53.620
 four games are involved such as fifa 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:57.250
 14 maidan and feel 47 live 14 and all 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:59.440
 in my case, too, 414 well, in general, all these 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:03.040
 four games have already been built on the new 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:06.400
 engine if i could figure it out and 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:08.320
 subtitle words messe in thought says 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:11.200
 that football is getting more and more 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:12.820
 contact sport and that 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.160
 resist defender now need 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:18.880
 be fit 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:22.090
 from his words, I understand that he is thin 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:24.130
 subtly hinted at new to new more 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:26.890
 achieve on movement and action in defense 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:28.750
 nothing new I am due to this video 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:31.360
 so I could not extract for myself 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:34.030
 I will use the fact that I could dig 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:36.400
 and from the old archives where he gave an interview 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:39.760
 producer this fifa nobody plan for my 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:42.730
 so his name will generally read at 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:44.620
 with brilliant leaflets a pair will be made 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:45.470
 changes in the tactical scheme of the players 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:47.540
 there is 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:50.480
 such parameters will be released to a new level 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:52.670
 as player custody and play defense i 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:54.680
 now also noticed the game speeds and 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:57.770
 what let's close certain 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:59.570
 realism because if earlier Iâ€™m any 

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:01.480
 football players could run for five seconds 

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:04.959
 the whole stadium now 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:08.290
 play and run it just destroyed and 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:09.970
 now have to overcome more effort 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:11.950
 to run all the same fields to score 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:15.220
 Goal also in the attack footballers will 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:17.140
 make smarter runner forward 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:18.879
 same will be launched and deeper to 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:20.650
 get the ball before and start the attack 

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:22.930
 proper 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:26.439
 also the striker will finally be able to 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:29.829
 learn how to more intelligently put the body 

00:03:26.439 --> 00:03:31.629
 although in the past to fight the defenders of 

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:34.060
 mine in the series it was also done 

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:38.200
 high level but now be yes for sure 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:39.909
 to more realism and reading recall 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:41.859
 will be done in my old yet 

00:03:39.909 --> 00:03:44.739
 engine for corinth consoles for to 

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:47.290
 x-ray consoles while I understand 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:49.019
 dribbling will also be slightly improved 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:51.939
 control of the ball at speed that is now 

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:54.909
 even more masterful we can 

00:03:51.939 --> 00:03:56.200
 leaks between defenders what 

00:03:54.909 --> 00:03:58.389
 naturally add a certain 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:00.069
 realism has also changed the angle of rotation 

00:03:58.389 --> 00:04:02.439
 if earlier 

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:04.930
 one rotation angle was set at 

00:04:02.439 --> 00:04:06.459
 acceleration which was equal to 22 degrees 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:08.889
 mta can now be rotated 

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:10.689
 from any angle to any 

00:04:08.889 --> 00:04:12.999
 direction at any time convenient for 

00:04:10.689 --> 00:04:14.920
 you have not suffered a blow mechanics straight 

00:04:12.999 --> 00:04:16.449
 some global change true 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:17.169
 there is before the engine moved our 

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:19.479
 players with 

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:21.280
 themselves to the sword if the position for the strike was 

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:23.680
 not the most suitable now 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:25.990
 the ballists themselves adapts themselves to the blow 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:28.330
 what to get to the right point in the right 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:30.520
 the time is now for each stroke has its own 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:33.220
 animation for example for impact wore or 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:34.780
 you have a percussion technique player every time 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:36.550
 will behave differently therefore 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:38.710
 now we probably hardly see it that way 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:41.229
 much for the sketes of their heads and every time 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:44.080
 now our angle will be different from each 

00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:45.610
 friend on this ball physics trajectory 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:48.370
 flight of the ball and now will be even closer to 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:52.060
 reality and there will be many different 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:54.669
 variations score probably goals i 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:57.370
 at least I hope for it and in principle 

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:59.919
 based on this, I do not know what 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:02.710
 add this as much as I could 

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:04.389
 find on the internet at the moment though 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:06.220
 maybe I was looking very bad but not so 

00:05:04.389 --> 00:05:09.820
 less of this presentation which 

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:12.159
 today was me but nothing new 

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:14.830
 I did not personally recognize myself here because we 

00:05:12.159 --> 00:05:18.130
 showed whether the pre-render movie whether 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:21.070
 that for the new ixbox not sure what it is 

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:23.440
 such engine to be used in fifa 14 

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:25.930
 but I would also like this whole thing 

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:27.759
 only hardly old xbox and old 

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:30.759
 playstation and will this whole thing pull 

00:05:27.759 --> 00:05:33.290
 and gives such information not actually 

00:05:30.759 --> 00:05:36.540
 it was but nonetheless 

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:39.000
 today 20 no records and already May 22 

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:40.830
 so this is still the most recent 

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.380
 information at least from my mouth 

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:45.090
 for you if something is new 

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:48.240
 appear and be sure this whole thing 

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:50.850
 I will take and take you to the course 

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:52.229
 business so if you grow up what are you 

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:54.060
 see now don't forget 

00:05:52.229 --> 00:05:56.550
 thank put your thumb 

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:59.280
 up which I adore everything and 

00:05:56.550 --> 00:06:02.160
 write your comments on do not know to 

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:04.949
 you wanted to personally see fifa 14 

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:06.570
 and don't forget to subscribe to the channel if 

00:06:04.949 --> 00:06:08.820
 you still have not done so and I 

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:11.220
 I say goodbye to you for a little while and soon 

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:16.520
 there will be a new portion of new videos about fairies 

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:16.520
 13 for now and other games for everyone bye
