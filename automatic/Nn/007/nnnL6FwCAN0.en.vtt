00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
care about I'm he dies he dies but if he

care about I'm he dies he dies but if he
does<00:02:39.270> die<00:02:39.540> which<00:02:40.260> is<00:02:40.380> which<00:02:40.530> technically<00:02:41.130> he

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
does die which is which technically he

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:42.620 
does die which is which technically he
did<00:02:41.370> because<00:02:41.670> they<00:02:41.790> revived<00:02:42.120> him<00:02:42.330> or

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
did because they revived him or

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:44.450 
did because they revived him or
something<00:02:42.900> like<00:02:43.020> that<00:02:43.080> so<00:02:43.530> that<00:02:44.250> would<00:02:44.340> be

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:44.460 
something like that so that would be

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:45.980 
something like that so that would be
through<00:02:44.700> the<00:02:44.970> three<00:02:45.180> legendary<00:02:45.480> song<00:02:45.750> he<00:02:45.870> was

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:45.990 
through the three legendary song he was

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:50.840 
through the three legendary song he was
gone<00:02:46.340> unless<00:02:47.340> somehow<00:02:47.670> and<00:02:48.090> you<00:02:48.150> know<00:02:49.850> they

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
gone unless somehow and you know they

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:53.690 
gone unless somehow and you know they
were<00:02:51.090> to<00:02:51.210> be<00:02:51.480> revived<00:02:51.960> which<00:02:52.380> that<00:02:53.280> may<00:02:53.460> not<00:02:53.640> be

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
were to be revived which that may not be

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.420 
were to be revived which that may not be
possible<00:02:54.030> I<00:02:54.720> just<00:02:55.620> don't<00:02:56.160> see<00:02:56.280> that<00:02:56.370> happening

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
possible I just don't see that happening

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.240 
possible I just don't see that happening
because<00:02:57.090> if<00:02:57.240> Nagato<00:02:57.750> get<00:02:57.900> sealed<00:02:58.200> away<00:02:58.350> then

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
because if Nagato get sealed away then

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:00.640 
because if Nagato get sealed away then
that<00:02:59.640> would<00:02:59.790> technically<00:03:00.120> mean<00:03:00.360> that

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:00.650 
that would technically mean that

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:02.960 
that would technically mean that
nobody's<00:03:01.650> gonna<00:03:01.920> there's<00:03:02.640> no<00:03:02.820> way<00:03:02.940> for

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
nobody's gonna there's no way for

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:07.310 
nobody's gonna there's no way for
anybody<00:03:03.270> to<00:03:03.600> be<00:03:03.630> able<00:03:03.840> to<00:03:03.960> game<00:03:05.180> if<00:03:06.180> my<00:03:06.510> ideas

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:07.320 
anybody to be able to game if my ideas

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:11.780 
anybody to be able to game if my ideas
are<00:03:07.500> correct<00:03:07.760> so<00:03:10.070> this<00:03:11.070> is<00:03:11.220> just<00:03:11.370> a<00:03:11.490> tribute

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
are correct so this is just a tribute

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.090 
are correct so this is just a tribute
