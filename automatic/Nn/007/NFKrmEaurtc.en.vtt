pretty sure that I want to stay within a
3870<00:01:20.250> 3850<00:01:21.030> kind<00:01:21.299> of<00:01:21.390> card<00:01:21.680> probably<00:01:22.680> not<00:01:22.890> a

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:22.970 
3870 3850 kind of card probably not a

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:27.230 
3870 3850 kind of card probably not a
3850<00:01:24.770> cuz<00:01:25.770> for<00:01:26.040> thirty<00:01:26.310> dollars<00:01:26.640> more<00:01:26.880> you<00:01:27.090> can

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
3850 cuz for thirty dollars more you can

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.420 
3850 cuz for thirty dollars more you can
get<00:01:27.420> 3870<00:01:28.290> which<00:01:28.409> is<00:01:29.390> as<00:01:30.590> insanely<00:01:31.590> fast<00:01:31.979> poor

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
get 3870 which is as insanely fast poor

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.550 
get 3870 which is as insanely fast poor
clock<00:01:32.759> and<00:01:33.090> deep<00:01:33.479> G<00:01:34.290> ddr4<00:01:34.950> so<00:01:36.020> this<00:01:37.020> model<00:01:37.409> has

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
clock and deep G ddr4 so this model has

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.080 
clock and deep G ddr4 so this model has
a<00:01:37.619> zero<00:01:38.130> therm<00:01:38.900> GPU<00:01:39.900> cooler<00:01:41.090> pre-installed

a zero therm GPU cooler pre-installed

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.370 
a zero therm GPU cooler pre-installed
and<00:01:42.360> it's<00:01:42.509> been<00:01:42.689> factory<00:01:43.140> overclocked<00:01:45.380> looks

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
and it's been factory overclocked looks

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.139 
and it's been factory overclocked looks

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
like a pretty good deal it comes with

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.240 
like a pretty good deal it comes with
all<00:01:48.299> the<00:01:48.360> accessories<00:01:48.570> I<00:01:49.110> need<00:01:49.350> one<00:01:50.009> of<00:01:50.040> the

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
critical ones will be the six pin molex

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.520 
critical ones will be the six pin molex
connector<00:01:54.149> because<00:01:54.570> my<00:01:54.750> power<00:01:54.990> supply<00:01:55.170> does

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
connector because my power supply does

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.789 
connector because my power supply does
not<00:01:55.680> have<00:01:55.920> one<00:01:56.159> and<00:01:56.630> I<00:01:57.630> really<00:01:58.290> like<00:01:58.469> that<00:01:58.500> to

people talking about in videos I know
that<00:04:49.850> they're<00:04:50.000> quite<00:04:50.300> a<00:04:50.330> bit<00:04:50.510> more<00:04:50.630> popular

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:51.140 
that they're quite a bit more popular

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:58.030 
that they're quite a bit more popular
than<00:04:52.330> hei<00:04:53.330> right<00:04:53.600> now<00:04:54.280> mom<00:04:55.870> but<00:04:56.870> these<00:04:57.170> 3870

00:04:58.030 --> 00:04:58.040 
than hei right now mom but these 3870

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:59.410 
than hei right now mom but these 3870
seem<00:04:58.250> to<00:04:58.400> have<00:04:58.520> killer<00:04:58.760> price<00:04:59.150> to<00:04:59.300> performance

00:04:59.410 --> 00:04:59.420 
seem to have killer price to performance

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:04.870 
seem to have killer price to performance
ratio<00:05:01.270> although<00:05:02.270> the<00:05:03.050> 9600<00:05:03.830> is<00:05:03.920> very<00:05:04.160> close<00:05:04.550> it

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:04.880 
ratio although the 9600 is very close it

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:08.080 
ratio although the 9600 is very close it
appears<00:05:05.750> to<00:05:05.840> me<00:05:05.930> that<00:05:06.020> the<00:05:06.230> 9600<00:05:06.950> GT<00:05:07.100> is<00:05:07.520> more

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:08.090 
appears to me that the 9600 GT is more

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:13.840 
appears to me that the 9600 GT is more
to<00:05:08.150> compare<00:05:08.480> with<00:05:08.660> the<00:05:08.810> 3850<00:05:11.050> so<00:05:12.050> that's<00:05:12.860> what

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:13.850 
to compare with the 3850 so that's what

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:17.380 
to compare with the 3850 so that's what
I<00:05:13.910> think<00:05:14.090> about<00:05:14.270> that<00:05:14.480> but<00:05:14.980> the<00:05:16.060> 96<00:05:17.060> hundreds

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:17.390 
I think about that but the 96 hundreds

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:19.360 
I think about that but the 96 hundreds
and<00:05:17.570> most<00:05:17.840> nvidia<00:05:18.230> cards<00:05:18.560> do<00:05:18.740> not<00:05:18.770> come<00:05:19.190> with

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:19.370 
and most nvidia cards do not come with

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:22.840 
and most nvidia cards do not come with

q3<00:05:59.540> technology<00:06:00.200> that<00:06:00.410> looks<00:06:00.710> promising<00:06:01.160> but

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:02.680 
q3 technology that looks promising but

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:05.680
