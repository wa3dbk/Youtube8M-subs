00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:11.820
 before starting I wanted to tell you about 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:14.940

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.800

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.930
 other video gta 5 you have to make us understand 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.150
 and for us this is the only system for 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.640
 know if how many of you want to see 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.920
 other video gta 5 but let's not get lost in 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.230
 chat and let's go see this 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.279
 exorbitant of marked by some 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.929
 users who told us guys 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:34.020
 guys do 2000 on this thing and us 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:44.789
 okay and let's go see this mega 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:46.320
 of beautiful boys I immediately say that I don't know 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.780
 if it has already been done in Italy by others 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.309
 in this case, please report them to them 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.039
 I will insert in the description to this video 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.090
 I saw some foreigners do it but 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.000
 let's say it 's something that struck me 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.289
 because actually a great cool 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.840
 then we must go to this area 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:03.059
 we are in the recess in the canal after 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.129
 the beach so you can't go wrong 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:08.010
 vicky to a helicopter knows very well that 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:11.040
 the point where you can take the 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.420
 helicopters precisely calling the service 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.850
 it's close by 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.770
 so we go to this place and it is 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.380
 very simple what we need there 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.390
 we need a machine gun and we have 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.530
 we have also tried other weapons 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.549
 tried with a shotgun 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.970
 that works with a shotgun 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:29.490
 you will tell us this and go there 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:32.070
 in short, without any problem and no 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.020
 all you have to do is get closer here 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:38.759
 in the water we say close to the water 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:41.340
 from this dock and go with the button 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:44.130
 r1 on playstation and matching up 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.530
 xbox one going to join on the wall ok 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.450
 so to do we say in the position from 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.670
 fighting on the wall having the weapon 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.430
 equipped once this is done 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:56.860
 you will have to arrive keeping yourself adhered to 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:59.560
 wall in the second wake of 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:01.090
 bolts you see on the mur ok you see 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.640
 of the columns of bolts to the 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:05.350
 second arrived the second one you don't have to 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.050
 pay attention to other speed 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:09.660
 do you care if you have to get to the second one 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:12.340
 and once done this you must 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:14.590
 frame the wall and press the aim on 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:17.110
 wall then at 2 on playstation 3 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:19.090
 there will be an immediate switch and you will pass 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:20.830
 with the knife this will already mean that 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:22.810
 you made this part of the route 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:25.150
 very well that is, you did everything a 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:28.270
 then have to go on to this 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:29.980
 pier is towards this climb in some 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:32.260
 cases there is no need to run aground but 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:35.290
 you continue here and you will see that you have 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:37.090
 the legs still wet that clothes 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:40.390
 wet garbagnate this will allow you 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:43.440
 to take and start running e 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:46.390
 do whatever you feel like jumping 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:49.390
 fist out all over the water in mode 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:52.989
 jesus christ epic way to fucka superstar 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:53.830
 so extreme power I tell you guys 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:56.680
 already we tried to do 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:59.230
 lots of tests from cars 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.400
 try to take a car once 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:03.400
 come out of the water 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:05.500
 or from taking a car that is already 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:07.930
 in the water but unfortunately does not work 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:10.510
 we still manage to find a system 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:12.070
 to drive on water with a car 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:14.440
 however the trick you see it 

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:16.989
 it works fine you see in the water 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.310
 but see the others doing this 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:21.040
 clichÃ© with you hopping 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:23.950
 inside the water or dive in 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:26.790
 mo dolphin continuously so let's say 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:29.549
 that only you will see this click 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:32.049
 while others will see you as 

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:35.620
 hopping or unstable as if it were 

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:38.080
 as if you were at the mercy of some gods 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:40.150
 some particular bugs and here you see 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:42.390
 banti and bovo that they demonstrate 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:44.420
 this speech is 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:46.890
 no guys i think it's one thing 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:49.110
 obviously you don't need a fuck let's talk 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:51.660
 but it's pretty cool I enjoyed it 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:54.540
 a bit with them to do this glitch e 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:57.360
 I hope nothing can give you too 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:59.160
