of the year did you expect this to
happen<00:00:46.460> well<00:00:47.460> we<00:00:48.149> didn't<00:00:48.329> expect<00:00:48.660> it<00:00:48.840> and<00:00:48.960> we

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
happen well we didn't expect it and we

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.770 
happen well we didn't expect it and we
hope<00:00:49.320> it<00:00:49.559> because<00:00:49.920> our<00:00:50.640> plan<00:00:51.030> in<00:00:51.329> the

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
hope it because our plan in the

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.160 
hope it because our plan in the
beginning<00:00:52.110> of<00:00:52.350> 2011<00:00:53.010> was<00:00:53.550> to<00:00:54.090> be<00:00:54.600> number<00:00:54.899> one

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
beginning of 2011 was to be number one

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.099 
beginning of 2011 was to be number one
in<00:00:55.199> Europe<00:00:55.620> and<00:00:55.800> I<00:00:56.789> think<00:00:57.059> this<00:00:57.390> is<00:00:57.449> now<00:00:57.719> happen

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
in Europe and I think this is now happen

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.880 
in Europe and I think this is now happen
so<00:00:58.440> yeah<00:00:59.930> fair<00:01:00.930> enough<00:01:00.960> but<00:01:01.170> coming<00:01:01.530> out<00:01:01.649> here

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
so yeah fair enough but coming out here

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.030 
so yeah fair enough but coming out here
on<00:01:02.760> the<00:01:03.600> first<00:01:03.780> day<00:01:04.080> but<00:01:04.710> did<00:01:04.799> you<00:01:04.830> thought

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
on the first day but did you thought

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.590 
on the first day but did you thought
your<00:01:05.220> biggest<00:01:05.610> opponents<00:01:06.150> were<00:01:06.240> going<00:01:06.420> to<00:01:06.510> be

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
your biggest opponents were going to be

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:07.850 
your biggest opponents were going to be
I'm<00:01:06.689> going<00:01:07.020> to<00:01:07.080> assume<00:01:07.290> it<00:01:07.439> was<00:01:07.560> basically

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860
