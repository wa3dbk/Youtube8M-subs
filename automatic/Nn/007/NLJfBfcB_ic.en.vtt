in the 1920s a handful of koalas came
out<00:00:24.539> to<00:00:24.689> the<00:00:24.810> island<00:00:25.199> and<00:00:25.410> they<00:00:25.980> flourished

since<00:00:26.520> then<00:00:26.910> there's<00:00:27.119> probably<00:00:27.240> about<00:00:27.480> two<00:00:27.930> or

00:02:33.619 --> 00:02:33.629 
putting collars on the koalas so he can

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:39.440 
putting collars on the koalas so he can
track<00:02:33.900> them<00:02:37.580> there's<00:02:38.580> various<00:02:38.909> ways<00:02:39.000> that<00:02:39.360> we

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
track them there's various ways that we

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.330 
track them there's various ways that we
catch<00:02:39.599> koalas<00:02:40.140> but<00:02:40.319> usually<00:02:40.709> it's<00:02:40.890> just<00:02:40.980> using

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
catch koalas but usually it's just using

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.430 
catch koalas but usually it's just using
extendable<00:02:42.239> poles<00:02:42.510> and<00:02:42.900> we<00:02:43.080> just<00:02:43.260> put<00:02:43.410> a

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
extendable poles and we just put a

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.320 
extendable poles and we just put a
plastic<00:02:43.830> bag<00:02:44.040> on<00:02:44.220> the<00:02:44.370> end<00:02:44.519> and<00:02:44.760> rustle<00:02:45.180> that

plastic bag on the end and rustle that
above<00:02:45.540> the<00:02:45.690> koalas<00:02:46.110> head<00:02:46.319> just<00:02:47.010> enough<00:02:47.280> to

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
above the koalas head just enough to

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:49.250 
above the koalas head just enough to
frustrate<00:02:48.330> them<00:02:48.480> and<00:02:48.599> annoy<00:02:48.810> them<00:02:49.019> and<00:02:49.170> they

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
frustrate them and annoy them and they

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.270 
frustrate them and annoy them and they
start<00:02:49.530> descending<00:02:50.010> the<00:02:50.160> tree<00:02:51.890> and<00:02:52.890> then<00:02:53.099> once

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
start descending the tree and then once

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.280 
start descending the tree and then once
they're<00:02:53.459> safely<00:02:54.150> under<00:02:54.390> anesthesia<00:02:54.870> we'll<00:02:55.170> go

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
they're safely under anesthesia we'll go

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:56.930 
they're safely under anesthesia we'll go
ahead<00:02:55.410> and<00:02:55.590> do<00:02:55.799> our<00:02:55.950> sampling<00:02:56.489> so<00:02:56.760> there'll<00:02:56.910> be

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
ahead and do our sampling so there'll be

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.089 
ahead and do our sampling so there'll be
things<00:02:57.239> like<00:02:57.329> blood<00:02:57.690> collection<00:02:58.290> ultrasound

00:02:59.089 --> 00:02:59.099

things like blood collection ultrasound
scent<00:02:59.670> gland<00:02:59.940> samples<00:03:00.629> and<00:03:01.200> we<00:03:01.319> also<00:03:01.470> take<00:03:01.859> a

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
scent gland samples and we also take a

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:10.430 
scent gland samples and we also take a
small<00:03:02.340> skin<00:03:02.700> sample<00:03:03.329> for<00:03:03.629> DNA<00:03:03.739> purposes<00:03:09.440> you

small skin sample for DNA purposes you

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.349 
small skin sample for DNA purposes you
know<00:03:10.560> this<00:03:10.769> is<00:03:10.890> an<00:03:11.040> important<00:03:11.549> project<00:03:12.030> for<00:03:12.090> me

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.740 
country and in being able to enjoy the
wildlife<00:03:22.950> it's<00:03:23.640> really<00:03:24.090> a<00:03:24.120> great<00:03:24.359> opportunity

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:27.650 
wildlife it's really a great opportunity
for<00:03:25.200> me<00:03:25.620> through<00:03:26.010> San<00:03:26.400> Diego<00:03:26.760> Zoo<00:03:27.000> Global<00:03:27.510> to

for me through San Diego Zoo Global to

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:35.770 

I<00:03:33.070> think<00:03:34.070> people<00:03:34.520> can<00:03:34.730> really<00:03:34.940> a<00:03:35.390> sort<00:03:35.720> of

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:35.780 
I think people can really a sort of

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:37.450 
I think people can really a sort of
really<00:03:35.960> empathize<00:03:36.380> with<00:03:36.440> pickle-lila<00:03:37.070> it's

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:37.460 
really empathize with pickle-lila it's

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:38.830 
really empathize with pickle-lila it's
an<00:03:37.550> animal<00:03:37.790> that<00:03:37.940> it's<00:03:38.060> really<00:03:38.360> easy<00:03:38.390> for<00:03:38.780> us

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:38.840 
an animal that it's really easy for us

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:41.590 
an animal that it's really easy for us
to<00:03:38.930> feel<00:03:39.170> empathy<00:03:39.620> works<00:03:39.830> and<00:03:40.400> I've<00:03:40.850> always

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:41.600 
to feel empathy works and I've always

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:44.260 
to feel empathy works and I've always
thought<00:03:42.140> that<00:03:42.170> if<00:03:42.740> we<00:03:43.220> can't<00:03:43.520> save<00:03:43.940> those

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:44.270 
thought that if we can't save those

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:46.270 
thought that if we can't save those
animals<00:03:44.840> then<00:03:45.440> we<00:03:45.560> really<00:03:45.830> can't<00:03:46.040> save

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:46.280 
animals then we really can't save

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:48.610 
animals then we really can't save
anything<00:03:46.580> it's<00:03:47.180> like<00:03:47.300> you<00:03:48.140> know<00:03:48.260> sort<00:03:48.440> of<00:03:48.560> the

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:48.620 
anything it's like you know sort of the

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:50.830 
anything it's like you know sort of the
ultimate<00:03:48.770> test<00:03:49.250> case<00:03:49.550> what<00:03:50.150> we<00:03:50.270> need<00:03:50.450> to<00:03:50.570> do<00:03:50.720> to

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840 
ultimate test case what we need to do to

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:52.630 
ultimate test case what we need to do to
save<00:03:51.050> it<00:03:51.200> I<00:03:51.290> don't<00:03:51.500> think<00:03:51.710> is<00:03:51.860> is<00:03:52.130> that<00:03:52.370> major

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:52.640 
save it I don't think is is that major

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:54.970 
save it I don't think is is that major
and<00:03:52.970> yet<00:03:53.330> it<00:03:53.870> appeals<00:03:54.230> to<00:03:54.500> virtually

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:54.980 
and yet it appeals to virtually

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:56.620 
and yet it appeals to virtually
everybody<00:03:55.220> so<00:03:55.670> you<00:03:55.730> think<00:03:56.090> everyone<00:03:56.480> could

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:56.630 
everybody so you think everyone could

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:58.930 
everybody so you think everyone could
make<00:03:56.690> a<00:03:56.810> small<00:03:57.230> sacrifice<00:03:58.100> if<00:03:58.640> that's<00:03:58.790> what

00:03:58.930 --> 00:03:58.940 
make a small sacrifice if that's what

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:00.850 
make a small sacrifice if that's what
you<00:03:59.030> need<00:03:59.180> to<00:03:59.300> make<00:03:59.330> so<00:03:59.930> I<00:03:59.960> really<00:04:00.440> think<00:04:00.680> it's

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:00.860 
you need to make so I really think it's

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:03.670 
you need to make so I really think it's
it's<00:04:01.190> one<00:04:01.400> of<00:04:01.490> those<00:04:01.640> key<00:04:02.270> animals<00:04:02.720> that<00:04:02.990> will

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:03.680 
it's one of those key animals that will

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:06.100 
it's one of those key animals that will
prove<00:04:03.980> to<00:04:04.010> us<00:04:04.310> whether<00:04:04.970> we<00:04:05.150> can<00:04:05.420> or<00:04:05.570> can't

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:06.110 
prove to us whether we can or can't

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:09.610 
prove to us whether we can or can't
in<00:04:06.500> the<00:04:06.709> end<00:04:06.980> save<00:04:07.430> ourselves
