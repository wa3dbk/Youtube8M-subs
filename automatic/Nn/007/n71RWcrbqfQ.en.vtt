00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
this one and market you actually find

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.470 
this one and market you actually find
this<00:02:20.160> one<00:02:20.370> cheaper<00:02:20.910> than<00:02:21.120> this<00:02:21.270> one

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
this one cheaper than this one

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.530 
this one cheaper than this one
apparently<00:02:21.900> I've<00:02:22.770> least<00:02:23.010> is<00:02:23.160> like<00:02:23.280> 129<00:02:23.910> this

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
apparently I've least is like 129 this

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.450 
apparently I've least is like 129 this
is<00:02:24.630> like<00:02:24.750> 140<00:02:25.230> now<00:02:25.350> I<00:02:25.710> could<00:02:25.980> be<00:02:26.010> wrong<00:02:26.220> but<00:02:26.280> I

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:26.460 
is like 140 now I could be wrong but I

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:29.510 
is like 140 now I could be wrong but I
think<00:02:26.520> it's<00:02:26.760> a<00:02:26.820> price<00:02:27.410> still<00:02:28.410> you<00:02:29.310> can<00:02:29.430> have

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
think it's a price still you can have

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.700 
think it's a price still you can have
other<00:02:29.670> boats<00:02:30.000> there<00:02:30.840> was<00:02:30.960> no<00:02:31.080> reason<00:02:31.440> to<00:02:31.470> trade

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:31.710 
other boats there was no reason to trade

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:34.820 
other boats there was no reason to trade
this<00:02:31.830> in<00:02:32.070> just<00:02:33.060> for<00:02:33.180> this<00:02:33.330> if<00:02:33.630> you<00:02:34.140> did<00:02:34.350> you

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
this in just for this if you did you

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:36.620 
this in just for this if you did you
lost<00:02:35.100> the<00:02:35.310> game<00:02:35.340> boy<00:02:35.670> advance<00:02:35.970> you<00:02:36.510> know

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
lost the game boy advance you know

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.030 
lost the game boy advance you know
technology<00:02:37.050> in<00:02:37.140> this<00:02:37.260> one<00:02:37.440> you're<00:02:37.710> not<00:02:37.830> there

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
technology in this one you're not there

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.890

computer<00:02:59.130> type<00:02:59.490> thing<00:02:59.870> this<00:03:00.870> will<00:03:00.990> be<00:03:01.140> the

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
computer type thing this will be the

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:02.870 
computer type thing this will be the
ones<00:03:01.470> that<00:03:01.710> take<00:03:01.920> out<00:03:02.100> in<00:03:02.310> the<00:03:02.370> public<00:03:02.550> because

ones that take out in the public because

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.430 
ones that take out in the public because
it's<00:03:03.030> smaller<00:03:03.270> it's<00:03:03.540> more<00:03:03.900> he<00:03:04.020> knows<00:03:04.170> it's

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
it's smaller it's more he knows it's

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.980 
it's smaller it's more he knows it's
more<00:03:04.560> affordable<00:03:05.270> so<00:03:06.270> there's<00:03:06.540> also<00:03:06.690> there's
