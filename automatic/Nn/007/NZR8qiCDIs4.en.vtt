00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.140
 "Magic Blanket" 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.500
 Call the royal carriage, sir, 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:15.380
 I will go to my annual visit to the castle! 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.880
 Throw away the biscuit, the shameful bastard! 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.140
 Who is the rogue? 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:27.100
 Hammer, be careful! 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:33.520
 Can't you play it elsewhere? 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:35.600
 Sorry, Bára! 

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:37.720
 I was here first. 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.180
 Ms! 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:40.360
 Look! 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:42.980
 That would be a beautiful royal cloak. 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:44.760
 Or drawbridge. 

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:46.340
 I found him first! 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:47.600
 Not me! 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:48.640
 Not me! Not me! 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.060
 Not me! I! I! 

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:51.100
 I! I! 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:52.900
 So calm, what is this? 

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:54.600
 Oh, no! 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:55.740
 Enough! 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.200
 Don't you know what it is? 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:59.880
 Just an old blanket, right? 

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:02.980
 It's not an ordinary blanket, Barco! 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:06.120
 This is the magic blanket of our ancestors! 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:11.880
 Brepto, do you know this is a magic blanket? 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.420
 Certainly. 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:14.240
 See? 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.460
 There are scenes from the history of Gumid. 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:21.020
 The images show the greatest actions of our ancestors. 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.520
 Wow, I could have my picture there too! 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.020
 You know gold, 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:30.120
 to get to her, you'd have to do something special. 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:31.400
 Need help. 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:32.560
 This is a great honor. 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:36.980
 She's too beautiful to lie here in her old suitcase. 

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:38.960
 We should hang her in the hall. 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:41.360
 Of course, on the south wall. 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.600
 Oh, on the south wall no, Broučo! 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.360
 There is much better light on the north wall! 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:48.840
 I say we hang her on the south wall! 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.800
 No, North! 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:51.660
 South Wall! 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:53.840
 North! - South! - North! 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.080
 It would be better to put her back before the two of you agreed. 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:02.220
 Oh, pity I have to save it again. 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.800
 Certainly Klárka would like it very much. 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:05.560
 Actually, 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.540
 Brept wouldn't be angry if I showed her to Clara, 

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:10.000
 after all, I will return it. 

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:16.080
 Klarka will be gone when she sees her. 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.360
 Oh, blanket! 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:20.900
 I have to go back for her! 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.200
 Oh, it's a day! 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.060
 With luck, I get the junk at least for a loaf of bread. 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:33.320
 What is it? 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.700
 Um, old carpet. 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.700
 He could bring me a few pence. 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:40.060
 Oh, no, 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.660
 I have to stop him before he sells the blanket. 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.520
 What did you say Lady ééé ... 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:53.640
 Lady Bane! 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.460
 I want you to help me find Gumid! 

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:58.920
 Gumídky? 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.680
 Bah, 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.140
 nonsense! 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:02.280
 Dear Lady, 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.000
 I'm afraid no one has seen Gumidka for a good 500 years. 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.360
 But I do! 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:10.260
 And if you help me, 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.860
 you will not regret it. 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.300
 Madam, this is ridiculous! 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:17.440
 I'm in charge of the kingdom. 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:18.360
 What? 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.680
 You're not going to help me? 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:21.920
 You hear well. 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:25.600
 Please immediately take this desperate woman out of here! 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.300
 With pleasure, sir! 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:30.080
 You'll pay me this insult, King! 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:34.740
 You and your tiny kingdom will feel the power of my revenge! 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:36.000
 Ááá! 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.260
 I'll punish you! 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:42.420
 (door slam) 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.160
 Buy warm buns! 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:52.240
 Buy baskets, wicker baskets! 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.320
 You see Klarko, over there! 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:57.260
 If he sells her, the others will be very angry. 

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:00.640
 Don't worry about Barco, I'll buy it back. 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:02.380
 Wait here, I'll get the money! 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:05.800
 Ahah! 

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:08.960
 Hey, watch out! 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:11.800
 Stupid, can't you go faster? 

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:13.860
 Faster, faster! 

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:17.300
 The sooner I'll be out of this kingdom, the better. 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:19.700
 Wait! 

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:21.480
 Gumídkovský medajlon. 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:24.360
 Gumid's spells are somewhere close. 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:26.620
 Where does it come from? 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:31.060
 Do you want her? 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:34.720
 Well please, the most beautiful blanket in the whole surrounding area! 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:35.780
 This is it! 

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:37.840
 Stop here! 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:40.280
 eeh! 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:42.020
 Just please, please! 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:43.360
 I'll buy the blanket! 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:44.560
 Seriously? 

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:45.740
 Lady Bane. 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:47.200
 What is she doing here? 

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:49.360
 Great buy, my lady!
