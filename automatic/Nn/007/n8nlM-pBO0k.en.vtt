way to train for comps would have to be

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:40.390 
way to train for comps would have to be
a<00:01:37.880> few<00:01:38.810> months<00:01:39.020> ago<00:01:39.140> we<00:01:39.260> went<00:01:39.650> like<00:01:39.950> rocky

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:40.400

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:47.360 
was flooded and so we just had like we

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:49.929 
was flooded and so we just had like we
had<00:01:47.479> an<00:01:47.600> indo<00:01:47.960> board<00:01:48.170> in<00:01:48.380> there<00:01:48.560> and<00:01:48.890> we<00:01:49.100> had<00:01:49.369> a

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:49.939 
had an indo board in there and we had a

had an indo board in there and we had a
circuit<00:01:50.570> board<00:01:50.750> and<00:01:51.200> then<00:01:51.350> we<00:01:51.590> had<00:01:51.710> a<00:01:51.740> rock<00:01:52.009> and

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:52.189 
circuit board and then we had a rock and

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:56.469 
circuit board and then we had a rock and
roll<00:01:52.340> and<00:01:52.810> um<00:01:53.810> that<00:01:54.680> was<00:01:55.189> probably<00:01:55.549> my

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:56.479 
roll and um that was probably my

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:58.090 
roll and um that was probably my
favorite<00:01:56.810> way<00:01:56.900> to<00:01:56.930> train<00:01:57.259> in<00:01:57.439> this<00:01:57.560> like<00:01:57.680> super

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:58.100 
favorite way to train in this like super

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:59.980 
favorite way to train in this like super
condensed<00:01:58.579> environment<00:01:59.180> where<00:01:59.329> everyone<00:01:59.360> was

00:01:59.980 --> 00:01:59.990 
condensed environment where everyone was

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:03.010 
condensed environment where everyone was
like<00:02:00.170> on<00:02:00.560> top<00:02:01.130> of<00:02:01.340> each<00:02:01.460> other<00:02:01.640> and<00:02:02.090> we<00:02:02.570> were<00:02:02.720> it

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.020 
like on top of each other and we were it

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:04.480 
like on top of each other and we were it
was<00:02:03.170> it<00:02:03.409> was<00:02:03.500> cool<00:02:03.710> because<00:02:03.979> usually<00:02:04.220> when

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:04.490 
was it was cool because usually when

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:06.219 
was it was cool because usually when
we're<00:02:04.640> in<00:02:04.729> here<00:02:04.939> we're<00:02:05.060> all<00:02:05.119> spanned<00:02:05.689> out<00:02:05.930> and

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:06.229 
we're in here we're all spanned out and

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:08.350 
we're in here we're all spanned out and
it's<00:02:06.380> harder<00:02:06.710> to<00:02:06.740> be<00:02:06.979> like<00:02:07.159> more<00:02:07.850> accountable

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 
it's harder to be like more accountable

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:09.789 
it's harder to be like more accountable
for<00:02:08.570> yourself<00:02:08.989> because<00:02:09.320> you<00:02:09.530> know<00:02:09.649> you're

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:09.799 
for yourself because you know you're

00:02:09.799 --> 00:02:11.979 
for yourself because you know you're
like<00:02:09.920> oh<00:02:10.070> I<00:02:10.100> don't<00:02:10.910> have<00:02:11.120> to<00:02:11.299> climb<00:02:11.510> that<00:02:11.750> if<00:02:11.900> I

00:02:11.979 --> 00:02:11.989 
like oh I don't have to climb that if I

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:14.620 
like oh I don't have to climb that if I
don't<00:02:12.170> want<00:02:12.320> to<00:02:12.530> butt<00:02:13.060> in<00:02:14.060> there<00:02:14.299> it<00:02:14.480> was

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:14.630 
don't want to butt in there it was

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:18.360 
don't want to butt in there it was
really<00:02:14.930> focused<00:02:15.500> on<00:02:15.829> climbing<00:02:16.510> regionals<00:02:17.510> was

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:41.850 
for me was the fact that I didn't talk

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:43.220 
for me was the fact that I didn't talk
to<00:03:42.030> anyone<00:03:42.240> else<00:03:42.480> about<00:03:42.600> what<00:03:42.840> I<00:03:42.870> was<00:03:43.020> writing
