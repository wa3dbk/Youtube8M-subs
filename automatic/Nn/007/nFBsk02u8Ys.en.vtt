get<00:00:14.099> on<00:00:14.219> to<00:00:14.250> the<00:00:14.400> first<00:00:14.700> case

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:22.360 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:24.570 

alright<00:00:23.230> so<00:00:23.380> this<00:00:23.470> case<00:00:23.710> 1<00:00:23.920> neonatal<00:00:24.340> jaundice

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:24.580 
alright so this case 1 neonatal jaundice

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:26.610 
alright so this case 1 neonatal jaundice
I'll<00:00:25.060> give<00:00:25.180> some<00:00:25.330> history<00:00:25.720> I'll<00:00:26.050> show<00:00:26.380> some

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:26.620 
I'll give some history I'll show some

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:27.840 
I'll give some history I'll show some
images<00:00:27.010> and<00:00:27.280> then<00:00:27.370> you<00:00:27.460> answer<00:00:27.730> a<00:00:27.760> question

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:27.850 
images and then you answer a question

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:31.170 
images and then you answer a question
and<00:00:28.390> we'll<00:00:28.510> go<00:00:28.630> through<00:00:28.900> things<00:00:29.790> so<00:00:30.790> this<00:00:30.970> is<00:00:31.150> a
