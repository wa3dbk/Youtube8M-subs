basically<00:02:55.340> what<00:02:56.340> this<00:02:56.489> basically<00:02:56.639> does<00:02:57.000> is<00:02:57.239> it

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:57.470 
basically what this basically does is it

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:00.860 
basically what this basically does is it
um<00:02:58.470> and<00:02:58.859> the<00:02:59.579> corner<00:02:59.939> and<00:03:00.090> top<00:03:00.359> left<00:03:00.569> corner

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
um and the corner and top left corner

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.909 
um and the corner and top left corner
it'll<00:03:01.019> say<00:03:01.169> flying<00:03:01.530> whenever<00:03:02.340> you're<00:03:02.840> flying

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:03.919 
it'll say flying whenever you're flying

00:03:03.919 --> 00:03:06.050 
it'll say flying whenever you're flying
but<00:03:04.919> I'm<00:03:05.040> just<00:03:05.129> gonna<00:03:05.280> go<00:03:05.400> ahead<00:03:05.639> and<00:03:05.730> erase

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
but I'm just gonna go ahead and erase

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:07.909 
but I'm just gonna go ahead and erase
that<00:03:06.090> and<00:03:06.510> so<00:03:06.900> it<00:03:07.019> doesn't<00:03:07.470> say<00:03:07.590> anything

00:03:07.909 --> 00:03:07.919 
that and so it doesn't say anything

00:03:07.919 --> 00:03:09.110 
that and so it doesn't say anything
because<00:03:08.040> I<00:03:08.220> don't<00:03:08.280> like<00:03:08.459> it<00:03:08.609> saying<00:03:08.790> anything

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
because I don't like it saying anything

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:13.610 
because I don't like it saying anything
and<00:03:09.269> just<00:03:09.299> go<00:03:10.139> to<00:03:10.200> file<00:03:10.439> save<00:03:12.230> alright<00:03:13.230> so
