there's<00:02:22.650> not<00:02:22.769> a<00:02:22.829> lot<00:02:23.010> of<00:02:23.040> traffic<00:02:23.340> on<00:02:23.640> your

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
there's not a lot of traffic on your

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:29.830 
there's not a lot of traffic on your
network<00:02:23.820> I<00:02:27.200> usually<00:02:28.200> you<00:02:28.440> want<00:02:28.620> to<00:02:28.680> get<00:02:28.829> around

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
network I usually you want to get around

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.349 
network I usually you want to get around
400,000<00:02:30.840> packets<00:02:31.400> so<00:02:32.400> we'll<00:02:32.730> just<00:02:32.760> wait<00:02:33.060> here

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:33.359 
400,000 packets so we'll just wait here

00:02:33.359 --> 00:03:40.600 
400,000 packets so we'll just wait here
for<00:02:33.600> a<00:02:33.630> sec

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:40.610 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:43.660 

okay<00:03:41.420> um<00:03:41.810> this<00:03:42.470> this<00:03:42.770> is<00:03:42.920> gonna<00:03:43.040> take<00:03:43.340> a<00:03:43.400> long

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:43.670 
okay um this this is gonna take a long

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:47.920 
okay um this this is gonna take a long
while<00:03:43.970> but<00:03:44.390> so<00:03:45.080> I'll<00:03:45.710> just<00:03:46.510> well<00:03:47.510> this<00:03:47.690> will

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:47.930 
while but so I'll just well this will

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:50.320 
while but so I'll just well this will
just<00:03:48.050> say<00:03:48.290> I'd<00:03:48.470> say<00:03:48.770> at<00:03:48.830> 4,000<00:03:49.700> packets<00:03:50.120> down

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:50.330 
just say I'd say at 4,000 packets down

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:51.490 
just say I'd say at 4,000 packets down
here<00:03:50.540> in<00:03:50.600> the<00:03:50.690> corner<00:03:50.720> even<00:03:51.170> though<00:03:51.260> i<00:03:51.290> only

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:51.500 
here in the corner even though i only

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:56.430 
here in the corner even though i only
have<00:03:51.620> over<00:03:51.940> 5,000<00:03:52.940> oldish<00:03:53.840> i<00:03:53.990> have<00:03:54.220> 400,000

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:02.130 
have over 5,000 oldish i have 400,000
because<00:03:57.440> um<00:03:58.240> now<00:03:59.240> we<00:03:59.300> can<00:03:59.540> close<00:03:59.780> out<00:04:00.020> of<00:04:00.050> this

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:02.140 
because um now we can close out of this

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:06.910 
because um now we can close out of this
okay<00:04:03.140> now<00:04:03.410> now<00:04:04.190> what<00:04:04.280> you<00:04:04.430> do<00:04:04.550> is<00:04:05.770> usually<00:04:06.770> you

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:06.920 
okay now now what you do is usually you

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:10.449 
okay now now what you do is usually you
ever<00:04:07.070> um<00:04:07.720> should<00:04:08.720> set<00:04:08.930> up<00:04:08.959> a<00:04:09.200> packet<00:04:09.709> log<00:04:09.890> while

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:10.459 
ever um should set up a packet log while

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:14.140 
ever um should set up a packet log while
you're<00:04:10.580> doing<00:04:10.700> this<00:04:11.080> so<00:04:12.080> that<00:04:12.290> um<00:04:13.000> so<00:04:14.000> that

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:14.150 
you're doing this so that um so that

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:16.120 
you're doing this so that um so that
it's<00:04:14.270> like<00:04:14.780> stays<00:04:15.080> a<00:04:15.110> giant<00:04:15.680> log<00:04:15.860> because

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:16.130 
it's like stays a giant log because

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:18.340 
it's like stays a giant log because
usually<00:04:16.549> you<00:04:17.060> can<00:04:17.239> only<00:04:17.359> make<00:04:17.540> the<00:04:17.720> log<00:04:18.079> size

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:18.350 
usually you can only make the log size

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:21.940 
usually you can only make the log size
up<00:04:18.560> to<00:04:18.970> 5<00:04:19.970> megabytes<00:04:20.630> but<00:04:21.019> now<00:04:21.260> it<00:04:21.440> saves<00:04:21.709> it<00:04:21.829> up

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:21.950 
up to 5 megabytes but now it saves it up

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:24.520 
up to 5 megabytes but now it saves it up
to<00:04:22.160> a<00:04:22.190> hundred<00:04:22.430> megabytes<00:04:23.060> I<00:04:23.390> just<00:04:23.930> was

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:24.530 
to a hundred megabytes I just was

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:28.540 
to a hundred megabytes I just was
quickly<00:04:24.830> stabbed<00:04:26.230> or<00:04:27.230> you<00:04:27.410> can<00:04:27.560> just<00:04:27.650> type<00:04:28.340> in

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:28.550 
quickly stabbed or you can just type in

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:31.780 
quickly stabbed or you can just type in
the<00:04:28.669> hunted<00:04:29.060> um<00:04:29.720> okay<00:04:30.560> now<00:04:30.770> and<00:04:31.130> make<00:04:31.610> the

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:31.790 
the hunted um okay now and make the

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:34.510 
the hunted um okay now and make the
maximum<00:04:32.330> directory<00:04:32.750> sighs<00:04:32.990> oh<00:04:33.320> I<00:04:33.950> made<00:04:34.400> it

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:34.520 
maximum directory sighs oh I made it

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:39.340 
maximum directory sighs oh I made it
like<00:04:34.669> 50,000<00:04:35.510> five<00:04:36.140> that<00:04:37.300> 50<00:04:38.300> gigs<00:04:38.600> it<00:04:39.020> doesn't

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:39.350 
like 50,000 five that 50 gigs it doesn't

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:43.420 
like 50,000 five that 50 gigs it doesn't
matter<00:04:39.530> ok<00:04:40.400> so<00:04:40.460> now<00:04:40.880> um<00:04:41.620> so<00:04:42.620> now<00:04:42.800> we<00:04:42.860> go<00:04:43.280> to<00:04:43.310> our

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:43.430 
matter ok so now um so now we go to our

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:48.040 
matter ok so now um so now we go to our
logs<00:04:44.110> on<00:04:45.110> clothes<00:04:45.770> that<00:04:46.419> so<00:04:47.419> I'll<00:04:47.540> go<00:04:47.690> to<00:04:47.750> my

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:48.050 
logs on clothes that so I'll go to my

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:54.330 
logs on clothes that so I'll go to my
computer<00:04:48.640> c<00:04:49.640> program<00:04:50.630> files<00:04:51.250> convey<00:04:52.250> y5<00:04:52.880> logs

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:54.340 
computer c program files convey y5 logs

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:58.060 
computer c program files convey y5 logs
look<00:04:55.340> at<00:04:55.550> here<00:04:55.850> they<00:04:56.000> all<00:04:56.120> are<00:04:56.150> na<00:04:56.570> minha<00:04:57.070> know

00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:58.070 
look at here they all are na minha know

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:03.370 
look at here they all are na minha know
i<00:04:58.100> could<00:04:58.490> use<00:04:58.700> all<00:04:58.880> of<00:04:59.030> them<00:04:59.950> but<00:05:00.950> I'm<00:05:01.310> not<00:05:02.380> okay

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:03.380 
i could use all of them but I'm not okay

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:06.219 
i could use all of them but I'm not okay
so<00:05:03.580> normally<00:05:04.580> the<00:05:04.729> logs<00:05:04.940> are<00:05:05.150> under<00:05:05.390> ncf

00:05:06.219 --> 00:05:06.229 
so normally the logs are under ncf

00:05:06.229 --> 00:05:08.650 
so normally the logs are under ncf
format<00:05:06.770> we<00:05:07.310> want<00:05:07.520> to<00:05:07.610> convert<00:05:07.880> them<00:05:08.090> to<00:05:08.120> see<00:05:08.630> a

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:08.660 
format we want to convert them to see a

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:12.100 
format we want to convert them to see a
key<00:05:09.020> so<00:05:09.460> what<00:05:10.460> we<00:05:10.790> took<00:05:11.120> a<00:05:11.300> ripped<00:05:11.510> up<00:05:11.660> you<00:05:11.930> just

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:12.110 
key so what we took a ripped up you just

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:14.140 
key so what we took a ripped up you just
doubled<00:05:12.380> it<00:05:12.530> now<00:05:13.430> it'll<00:05:13.580> come<00:05:13.790> up<00:05:13.820> in<00:05:14.060> this

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:14.150 
doubled it now it'll come up in this

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:16.210 
doubled it now it'll come up in this
thing<00:05:14.360> called<00:05:14.570> the<00:05:14.630> log<00:05:14.900> viewer<00:05:15.320> now<00:05:16.160> you

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:16.220 
thing called the log viewer now you

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:20.890 
thing called the log viewer now you
click<00:05:16.430> the<00:05:16.580> file<00:05:17.320> export<00:05:18.320> log<00:05:18.560> and<00:05:19.630> TCP<00:05:20.630> dump

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:20.900 
click the file export log and TCP dump

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:28.290 
click the file export log and TCP dump
format<00:05:22.540> and<00:05:23.540> then<00:05:23.590> on<00:05:24.590> this<00:05:25.310> type<00:05:25.610> in<00:05:25.790> like

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:28.300 

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:30.589 

and<00:05:28.840> now<00:05:28.960> I<00:05:28.990> just<00:05:29.229> saved<00:05:29.440> it<00:05:29.620> to<00:05:29.680> my<00:05:29.800> desktop

00:05:30.589 --> 00:05:30.599 
and now I just saved it to my desktop

00:05:30.599 --> 00:05:34.230 
and now I just saved it to my desktop
now<00:05:31.599> once<00:05:31.990> it's<00:05:32.169> a<00:05:32.259> cap<00:05:32.590> file<00:05:33.069> it<00:05:33.729> goes<00:05:33.940> out<00:05:34.150> of

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:34.240 
now once it's a cap file it goes out of

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:36.990 
now once it's a cap file it goes out of
that<00:05:35.169> right<00:05:35.770> here<00:05:36.069> and<00:05:36.250> I<00:05:36.340> feeler<00:05:36.669> to

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:37.000 
that right here and I feeler to

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.719 
that right here and I feeler to
cat<00:05:37.330> five<00:05:37.690> um<00:05:38.460> I'm<00:05:39.460> going<00:05:39.580> to<00:05:39.639> open<00:05:39.759> air<00:05:40.150> crack

00:05:41.719 --> 00:05:41.729 
cat five um I'm going to open air crack

00:05:41.729 --> 00:05:45.180 
cat five um I'm going to open air crack
I'm<00:05:42.729> going<00:05:42.909> to<00:05:42.970> go<00:05:43.090> to<00:05:43.150> the<00:05:43.240> bin<00:05:43.949> now<00:05:44.949> there's

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:45.190 
I'm going to go to the bin now there's

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:47.999 
I'm going to go to the bin now there's
this<00:05:45.280> new<00:05:45.550> program<00:05:45.789> called<00:05:46.030> aircrack-ng<00:05:47.009> GUI

00:05:47.999 --> 00:05:48.009 
this new program called aircrack-ng GUI

00:05:48.009 --> 00:05:51.089 
this new program called aircrack-ng GUI
graphical<00:05:48.849> user<00:05:49.300> interface<00:05:50.020> we<00:05:50.740> double<00:05:51.069> click

00:05:51.089 --> 00:05:51.099 
graphical user interface we double click

00:05:51.099 --> 00:05:56.399 
graphical user interface we double click
on<00:05:51.340> that<00:05:52.199> is<00:05:53.669> we<00:05:54.669> noticed<00:05:55.030> that<00:05:55.389> it<00:05:55.509> uses<00:05:55.659> a<00:05:55.810> WEP

00:05:56.399 --> 00:05:56.409 
on that is we noticed that it uses a WEP

00:05:56.409 --> 00:05:59.249 
on that is we noticed that it uses a WEP
encryption<00:05:57.030> so<00:05:58.030> I<00:05:58.060> know<00:05:58.360> so<00:05:58.750> I<00:05:58.810> don't<00:05:58.900> want
