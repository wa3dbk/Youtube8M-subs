00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:13.900
 acer travelmate p 253 that is a 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:18.430
 notebook with 15 inch display in the 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:19.830
 diagonal 15 inches 1366 x 768 pixels 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:22.539
 resolution 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.090
 here in this model works 

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:28.600
 pentium b 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:30.130
 960 from inter ja and let's have a look 

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:32.259
 now just the device 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:35.979
 we have a really send here 

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:38.679
 akkudeckel I dreesmann yes with one 

00:00:35.979 --> 00:00:44.559
 deposed acer lettering here on 

00:00:38.679 --> 00:00:51.100
 a metal element we have on the 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:55.510
 front a sd-card slot here and 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:57.370
 can cover it and we have 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:00.459
 Of course, a few more LEDs 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:02.979
 show you the status of the device for 

00:01:00.459 --> 00:01:05.770
 hoffmann sees himself here a bit yes 

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:10.330
 on the right side is then 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:13.530
 also a dvd multi burner as well as two 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:15.820
 usb ports and the kensington lock 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.810
 You can do this simply by using your device 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:20.770
 sure at a fair or in 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.200
 Meetings then with a 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:27.250
 ogle lok should be known 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:30.820
 Actually, that's exactly what we have 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:34.620
 on the left side of the device the 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:39.100
 stream port a lan port a fan 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:42.130
 To air or exhaust slit the VGA port 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:46.210
 a radioreporter still a usb port 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:51.610
 as well as a microphone and a headset 35 mm 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:52.030
 input yes on the back you see 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:54.850
 here 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:57.760
 the maintenance flap and the battery 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:59.320
 this is then actually hereby 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:01.150
 10 I've heard it knows unfortunately 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:03.800
 Subject to hand that's why I can 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:08.950
 you this but I can be right 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:14.260
 the battery with 4400 milliamp hours 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:17.750
 should last for 35 hours of operation 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:19.570
 is used since in the up here 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:23.840
 the edge attaches 

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:25.910
 does not work, it just at the edge 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:27.980
 sets as well and then just a folding 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:32.330
 and wait until it works he has it 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:34.190
 worked out I show you the device still 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:35.590
 from the inside you have it only briefly 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:41.750
 seen 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:43.400
 that's what pentium d 960 is 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:48.370
 internally here in this model 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:52.210
 we have 4 gb 500 gb ram 500 gb 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:55.520
 hard disk as well as 4 gb ram maximum 

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:59.150
 he upgrades to 8 gb ram 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:02.900
 the keyboard no chiclet keyboard 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:06.080
 but rather something old-fashioned I would 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:08.870
 now almost saying clacking is also very 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.800
 really not that great is real 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:11.360
 loud when typing 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:15.050
 Maybe you'll listen to this too 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:16.400
 little bit if you are here so longer 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:18.380
 it is already writing 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:23.030
 a little bit more believing we have here 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:25.430
 above the speakers a hidden 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:28.640
 something small touchpad for mine 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:31.670
 taste with a consistent taste 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:34.250
 here with two pressure points yes otherwise 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:37.880
 Of course there is one thing left to say 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:40.690
 webcam with installed and I hold him once 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:40.690
 watch what works 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:45.909
 he definitely runs we always do 

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:48.310
 it's not that important anymore 

00:03:45.909 --> 00:03:50.109
 one else can say yeah the 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:52.260
 new business case here from acer 

00:03:50.109 --> 00:03:54.370
 makes a really smart impression 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.359
 I can turn it around again 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:57.659
 you still have my impression 

00:03:55.359 --> 00:04:00.909
 It can be very shiny 

00:03:57.659 --> 00:04:02.230
 piano lacquer I almost got it 

00:04:00.909 --> 00:04:05.650
 probably very fingerprint 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:07.329
 will be sensitive but with one 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:10.170
 microfiber cloth is there then too 

00:04:07.329 --> 00:04:14.049
 quickly the master of the whole yes 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:15.909
 otherwise plastic is a shame 

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:19.060
 but actually for the price of each 

00:04:15.909 --> 00:04:22.599
 case processed quite well if you 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:24.849
 a cheap notebook is looking for the 

00:04:22.599 --> 00:04:28.150
 Office and internet operation then looks 

00:04:24.849 --> 00:04:28.650
 you the acer travelmate 253 times more exactly 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:31.330
 on 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:33.900
 I say thank you for watching and until 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:33.900
 next time
