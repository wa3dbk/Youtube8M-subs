00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:15.449 
and I mean Wind Waker is my favorite
game<00:02:13.780> of<00:02:13.810> all<00:02:13.930> time<00:02:14.230> and<00:02:14.620> would<00:02:15.220> have<00:02:15.310> been

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:15.459 
game of all time and would have been

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:17.400 
game of all time and would have been
cool<00:02:15.700> to<00:02:15.849> see<00:02:15.970> a<00:02:16.000> portable<00:02:16.480> cel-shaded<00:02:17.080> Zelda

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410

cool to see a portable cel-shaded Zelda
with<00:02:17.560> none<00:02:18.040> of<00:02:18.160> that<00:02:18.310> touchscreen<00:02:18.970> control

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:21.780 
with none of that touchscreen control
 it's<00:02:20.920> also<00:02:21.100> interesting<00:02:21.460> to<00:02:21.730> think

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
 it's also interesting to think

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:23.850 
 it's also interesting to think
how<00:02:22.510> would<00:02:22.690> the<00:02:22.810> story<00:02:23.020> play<00:02:23.380> out<00:02:23.410> I<00:02:23.560> mean

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
how would the story play out I mean

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:26.250 
how would the story play out I mean
winwaker<00:02:24.430> link<00:02:24.580> killed<00:02:25.000> Ganon<00:02:25.540> spoilers<00:02:26.050> and

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
winwaker link killed Ganon spoilers and

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.650 
winwaker link killed Ganon spoilers and
Lincoln<00:02:27.160> tetra<00:02:27.610> found<00:02:27.820> a<00:02:28.000> new<00:02:28.210> Hyrule

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:31.600 
spoilers so where else would they go

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.960 
spoilers so where else would they go
with<00:02:31.810> this<00:02:32.020> instead<00:02:32.650> of<00:02:32.710> trains<00:02:33.310> links<00:02:33.760> in<00:02:33.880> a

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
with this instead of trains links in a

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:36.480 
with this instead of trains links in a
jet<00:02:34.270> fighter<00:02:34.450> or<00:02:34.720> something<00:02:35.110> it<00:02:36.010> does<00:02:36.220> sound

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
like however that the gameplay style was

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:39.600 
like however that the gameplay style was
always<00:02:38.500> gonna<00:02:38.650> be<00:02:38.740> the<00:02:38.980> same<00:02:39.010> with<00:02:39.340> the<00:02:39.460> whole

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
always gonna be the same with the whole
