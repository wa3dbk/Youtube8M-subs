 the first stage is until you are insurgents about 30 kilometers ahead 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:39.080
 It may not be much, but it must be taken into account that horses travel in 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.690

 some take the opportunity to change hard 

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:53.489
 at this stage many of the cables have to be taken care of with serums and vitamins 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:56.489
 for fatigue 

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:07.989

 at this point the second night is spent 

00:04:48.379 --> 00:04:51.469

00:04:51.469 --> 00:04:53.099
 missions of the sanctuaries 

00:04:53.099 --> 00:04:56.099

 of this ride 

00:05:29.339 --> 00:05:31.089
 and the idea is to come 

00:05:31.089 --> 00:05:33.439

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:59.770
 we live by fulfilling a tradition 

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:02.969
 we also live a little bit to know the roots 

00:06:03.839 --> 00:06:06.279
 California 

00:06:06.279 --> 00:06:09.279
