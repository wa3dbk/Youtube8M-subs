make this work

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.410 
make this work
first<00:00:19.410> thing<00:00:19.650> is<00:00:19.800> that<00:00:20.310> you<00:00:20.699> need<00:00:20.820> firewalkers

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
to do is everywhere reading and there

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.020 
to do is everywhere reading and there
people<00:00:49.440> are<00:00:49.680> saying<00:00:50.070> you<00:00:50.520> know<00:00:50.550> and<00:00:50.789> and

people are saying you know and and
reading<00:00:51.239> this<00:00:51.480> stuff<00:00:51.750> and<00:00:51.989> they<00:00:52.110> can't<00:00:52.350> figure

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
reading this stuff and they can't figure

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.010 
reading this stuff and they can't figure
out<00:00:52.649> how<00:00:52.829> this<00:00:53.010> works<00:00:53.309> and<00:00:53.610> basically<00:00:54.420> there

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
out how this works and basically there

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.500 
out how this works and basically there
is<00:00:55.050> one<00:00:55.379> way<00:00:55.559> to<00:00:55.620> make<00:00:55.890> this<00:00:56.039> work<00:00:56.309> and<00:00:56.489> I<00:00:57.360> don't

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
is one way to make this work and I don't

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:58.970 
is one way to make this work and I don't
know<00:00:57.750> anybody<00:00:57.960> that's<00:00:58.289> figured<00:00:58.590> this<00:00:58.739> out<00:00:58.920> yet

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
know anybody that's figured this out yet

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.790 
know anybody that's figured this out yet
now<00:00:59.699> I<00:00:59.730> make<00:01:00.210> like<00:01:00.629> a<00:01:00.870> ton<00:01:01.140> of<00:01:01.170> mistakes<00:01:01.590> here

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
now I make like a ton of mistakes here

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.110 
now I make like a ton of mistakes here
and<00:01:01.859> so<00:01:02.160> like<00:01:02.399> you're<00:01:02.730> going<00:01:02.850> to<00:01:02.910> look<00:01:03.000> at<00:01:03.090> a

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
and so like you're going to look at a

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.210 
and so like you're going to look at a
time<00:01:03.390> on<00:01:03.840> here<00:01:04.290> and<00:01:04.470> it<00:01:04.589> kind<00:01:04.830> of<00:01:04.920> took<00:01:05.040> me<00:01:05.189> a

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
time on here and it kind of took me a

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.550 
time on here and it kind of took me a
while<00:01:05.339> to<00:01:05.400> figure<00:01:05.610> this<00:01:05.820> out<00:01:06.000> but<00:01:06.869> you<00:01:07.170> do<00:01:07.439> not

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
while to figure this out but you do not

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:08.660 
while to figure this out but you do not
want<00:01:07.770> to<00:01:07.830> run<00:01:07.950> in<00:01:08.130> there<00:01:08.280> with<00:01:08.400> the<00:01:08.460> fire

of<00:03:05.550> like<00:03:06.000> firewalker<00:03:06.540> damage<00:03:06.900> but<00:03:07.050> it's<00:03:07.170> very

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350 
of like firewalker damage but it's very

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:09.199 
of like firewalker damage but it's very
hard<00:03:07.590> to<00:03:07.739> find<00:03:07.890> those<00:03:08.040> places<00:03:08.220> I<00:03:08.519> was<00:03:08.880> very

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:09.209 
hard to find those places I was very

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:11.270 
hard to find those places I was very
very<00:03:09.540> frustrated<00:03:10.230> and<00:03:10.350> I<00:03:10.890> thought<00:03:11.130> actually

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
very frustrated and I thought actually

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:12.949 
very frustrated and I thought actually
wasn't<00:03:11.730> going<00:03:11.850> to<00:03:11.910> make<00:03:12.030> this<00:03:12.150> video<00:03:12.480> because

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 
wasn't going to make this video because

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:14.180 
wasn't going to make this video because
I<00:03:13.140> was<00:03:13.260> like<00:03:13.380> y'all<00:03:13.560> I<00:03:13.590> can't<00:03:13.680> even<00:03:14.069> figure

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
I was like y'all I can't even figure

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:16.220 
I was like y'all I can't even figure
this<00:03:14.370> shit<00:03:14.430> out<00:03:14.700> but<00:03:15.269> then<00:03:15.450> I<00:03:15.690> figured<00:03:15.810> this

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
this shit out but then I figured this

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:17.990 
this shit out but then I figured this
shit<00:03:16.470> out<00:03:16.500> and<00:03:16.890> that's<00:03:17.519> what<00:03:17.670> you<00:03:17.730> looking<00:03:17.940> at

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
shit out and that's what you looking at

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.509 
shit out and that's what you looking at
right<00:03:18.239> now<00:03:18.299> and<00:03:18.690> so<00:03:19.320> again<00:03:19.709> you<00:03:19.980> have<00:03:20.220> to<00:03:20.370> be

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519 
right now and so again you have to be

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:22.940 
right now and so again you have to be
right<00:03:20.760> in<00:03:20.940> between<00:03:20.970> the<00:03:21.660> little<00:03:22.230> door<00:03:22.590> right

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
right in between the little door right

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:25.039 
right in between the little door right
inside<00:03:23.280> this<00:03:23.430> little<00:03:23.700> cubby<00:03:23.940> hole<00:03:24.090> and<00:03:24.329> it's

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:25.049 
inside this little cubby hole and it's

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:26.210 
inside this little cubby hole and it's
going<00:03:25.140> to<00:03:25.200> funnel<00:03:25.470> them<00:03:25.650> all<00:03:25.739> in<00:03:25.890> there<00:03:26.100> and

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
going to funnel them all in there and

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:27.080 
going to funnel them all in there and
they're<00:03:26.310> not<00:03:26.340> going<00:03:26.519> to<00:03:26.579> be<00:03:26.640> able<00:03:26.700> to<00:03:26.790> even<00:03:26.940> hit

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
they're not going to be able to even hit

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:27.949 
they're not going to be able to even hit
you<00:03:27.120> but<00:03:27.390> they're<00:03:27.540> still<00:03:27.720> going<00:03:27.840> to<00:03:27.900> be

experience<00:03:35.010> bar<00:03:35.190> is<00:03:35.280> going<00:03:35.430> up<00:03:35.670> now<00:03:36.209> I<00:03:36.239> did

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:36.570 
experience bar is going up now I did

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:38.120 
experience bar is going up now I did
suffer<00:03:36.840> a<00:03:37.049> little<00:03:37.140> bit<00:03:37.320> under<00:03:37.560> ten<00:03:37.769> minutes

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
suffer a little bit under ten minutes

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:39.590 
suffer a little bit under ten minutes
and<00:03:38.430> I<00:03:38.549> got<00:03:38.760> a<00:03:38.790> little<00:03:39.000> bit<00:03:39.150> of<00:03:39.269> pretend

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:39.600 
and I got a little bit of pretend

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.110 
and I got a little bit of pretend
milling<00:03:39.810> experience<00:03:40.260> I<00:03:40.410> think<00:03:40.470> and<00:03:40.890> so<00:03:41.579> I'd

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
milling experience I think and so I'd

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.360 
milling experience I think and so I'd
say<00:03:42.180> average<00:03:42.570> experience<00:03:43.320> per<00:03:43.620> hour<00:03:43.739> like<00:03:44.190> I

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
say average experience per hour like I

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:46.610 
say average experience per hour like I
don't<00:03:44.430> know<00:03:44.549> hundred<00:03:44.910> and<00:03:45.260> twenty<00:03:46.260> thousand

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
don't know hundred and twenty thousand

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.620 
don't know hundred and twenty thousand
or<00:03:46.680> something<00:03:46.769> like<00:03:46.950> that<00:03:47.299> can't<00:03:48.299> really<00:03:48.390> say

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:48.630 
or something like that can't really say

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:51.470 
or something like that can't really say
for<00:03:48.660> sure<00:03:48.840> but<00:03:49.410> that'd<00:03:49.829> be<00:03:49.859> my<00:03:50.130> guess<00:03:50.430> and<00:03:50.670> so

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480 
for sure but that'd be my guess and so

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.360 
for sure but that'd be my guess and so
basically<00:03:51.989> as<00:03:52.290> far<00:03:52.470> as<00:03:52.709> a<00:03:52.829> so<00:03:52.950> far<00:03:53.130> I<00:03:53.310> don't

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 
basically as far as a so far I don't

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:55.009 
basically as far as a so far I don't
have<00:03:53.640> those<00:03:53.850> as<00:03:54.030> you<00:03:54.120> can<00:03:54.239> see<00:03:54.450> and<00:03:54.720> then<00:03:54.870> my

00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:55.019 
have those as you can see and then my

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:56.690 
have those as you can see and then my
armor<00:03:55.260> is<00:03:55.320> going<00:03:55.440> to<00:03:55.530> get<00:03:55.680> broken<00:03:55.920> like<00:03:56.519> that's

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:56.700 
armor is going to get broken like that's

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:58.310 
armor is going to get broken like that's
going<00:03:56.820> to<00:03:56.880> be<00:03:56.970> a<00:03:57.030> bad<00:03:57.269> day<00:03:57.540> for<00:03:57.570> me<00:03:57.810> when<00:03:58.019> I<00:03:58.079> wake

00:03:58.310 --> 00:03:58.320 
going to be a bad day for me when I wake

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:02.090 
going to be a bad day for me when I wake
up<00:03:58.500> now<00:03:59.130> here's<00:03:59.400> the<00:03:59.609> shit<00:03:59.850> that<00:03:59.880> sucks<00:04:01.100> it

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:02.100 
up now here's the shit that sucks it

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:04.729 
up now here's the shit that sucks it
whenever<00:04:02.430> you<00:04:02.640> level<00:04:03.150> you<00:04:03.900> explode<00:04:04.410> the

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:04.739 
whenever you level you explode the

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:08.030 
whenever you level you explode the
Paragon<00:04:05.250> you<00:04:05.549> explode<00:04:06.410> and<00:04:07.410> you<00:04:07.590> damage

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
Paragon you explode and you damage

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:09.680 
Paragon you explode and you damage
everything<00:04:08.280> around<00:04:08.519> you<00:04:08.730> whenever<00:04:09.480> you<00:04:09.540> get<00:04:09.630> a

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:09.690 
everything around you whenever you get a

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:13.819 
everything around you whenever you get a
Paragon<00:04:10.049> level<00:04:10.340> so<00:04:12.049> you<00:04:13.049> need<00:04:13.260> to<00:04:13.410> I<00:04:13.709> don't

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:13.829 
Paragon level so you need to I don't

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:15.259 
Paragon level so you need to I don't
know<00:04:14.040> is<00:04:14.190> it's<00:04:14.400> going<00:04:14.609> to<00:04:14.700> be<00:04:14.790> better<00:04:14.940> if

00:04:15.259 --> 00:04:15.269 
know is it's going to be better if

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:16.969 
know is it's going to be better if
you're<00:04:15.420> higher<00:04:15.600> level<00:04:15.989> here<00:04:16.200> because<00:04:16.709> you're

00:04:16.969 --> 00:04:16.979 
you're higher level here because you're

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:19.670 
you're higher level here because you're
going<00:04:17.100> to<00:04:17.160> explode<00:04:17.489> less<00:04:17.729> but<00:04:18.600> again<00:04:19.019> it<00:04:19.229> takes

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680 
going to explode less but again it takes

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:22.420 
going to explode less but again it takes
a<00:04:19.829> long<00:04:20.010> time<00:04:20.280> for<00:04:20.789> these<00:04:21.030> things<00:04:21.090> to<00:04:21.570> actually

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:22.430 
a long time for these things to actually

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:26.180 
a long time for these things to actually
what's<00:04:23.430> a<00:04:23.520> call<00:04:24.530> it's<00:04:25.530> actually<00:04:25.800> give<00:04:25.950> you<00:04:26.070> an

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:26.190 
what's a call it's actually give you an

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:27.469 
what's a call it's actually give you an
entire<00:04:26.490> level

00:04:27.469 --> 00:04:27.479 
entire level

00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:29.240 
entire level
