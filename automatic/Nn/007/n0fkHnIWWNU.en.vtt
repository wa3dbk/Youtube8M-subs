00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.780 
mean actually I thought I would get more
for<00:02:16.520> $90<00:02:18.040> because<00:02:19.040> you<00:02:19.310> know<00:02:19.400> they<00:02:19.550> have<00:02:19.670> the

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
for $90 because you know they have the

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:23.620 
for $90 because you know they have the
same<00:02:20.000> helmet<00:02:20.600> on<00:02:20.780> ebay<00:02:21.260> com<00:02:21.709> for<00:02:22.300> $55<00:02:23.300> I<00:02:23.330> think

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:23.630 
same helmet on ebay com for $55 I think

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:28.030 
same helmet on ebay com for $55 I think
so<00:02:24.100> you<00:02:25.100> know<00:02:25.220> whatever<00:02:25.900> so<00:02:26.900> that<00:02:27.770> was<00:02:27.920> a<00:02:27.950> waste

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
so you know whatever so that was a waste

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:36.310 
so you know whatever so that was a waste
of<00:02:29.500> forty<00:02:30.500> dollars<00:02:30.830> um<00:02:33.760> velcro<00:02:34.959> it's<00:02:35.959> not<00:02:36.140> the

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:36.320 
of forty dollars um velcro it's not the

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:37.960 
of forty dollars um velcro it's not the
best<00:02:36.470> velcro<00:02:36.980> because<00:02:37.310> it<00:02:37.489> doesn't<00:02:37.820> have<00:02:37.850> a

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:37.970 
best velcro because it doesn't have a

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:40.449 
best velcro because it doesn't have a
sticky<00:02:38.480> back<00:02:38.660> to<00:02:38.900> it<00:02:39.050> I<00:02:39.260> didn't<00:02:39.920> see<00:02:40.070> it's<00:02:40.250> just

00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:54.739 
like stitch to the side so it was like

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:56.500 
like stitch to the side so it was like
you<00:02:54.980> know<00:02:55.100> when<00:02:55.519> she<00:02:55.670> peeled<00:02:55.970> it<00:02:56.060> off<00:02:56.180> and<00:02:56.390> was

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 
you know when she peeled it off and was

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:59.080 
you know when she peeled it off and was
like<00:02:56.630> you<00:02:57.380> know<00:02:57.530> like<00:02:57.560> one<00:02:58.190> by<00:02:58.370> one<00:02:58.550> by<00:02:58.790> one<00:02:59.000> of

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.090 
like you know like one by one by one of

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:01.150 
like you know like one by one by one of
the<00:02:59.150> stitching<00:02:59.540> came<00:02:59.690> off<00:02:59.900> and<00:03:00.830> I<00:03:01.130> was

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:01.160 
the stitching came off and I was

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:02.650 
the stitching came off and I was
thinking<00:03:01.340> that<00:03:01.670> that<00:03:01.820> would<00:03:01.970> be<00:03:02.000> the<00:03:02.150> sticky

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.660 
thinking that that would be the sticky

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:04.090 
thinking that that would be the sticky
stuff<00:03:02.720> underneath<00:03:03.260> that<00:03:03.560> but<00:03:03.830> it<00:03:03.920> was<00:03:04.070> just

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:04.100 
stuff underneath that but it was just

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:06.130 
stuff underneath that but it was just
more<00:03:04.430> of<00:03:04.489> the<00:03:04.700> clock<00:03:04.970> so<00:03:05.480> that<00:03:05.660> was<00:03:05.810> kind<00:03:06.080> of

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.140 
more of the clock so that was kind of

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:14.229 
more of the clock so that was kind of
stupid<00:03:10.150> overall<00:03:11.530> decent<00:03:12.530> helmet<00:03:13.070> right<00:03:14.060> now
