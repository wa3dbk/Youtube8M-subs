00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.090 
to drain your battery like crazy because

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:27.430 
to drain your battery like crazy because
it's<00:03:26.330> always<00:03:26.630> moving<00:03:26.780> around<00:03:26.959> me<00:03:27.260> on<00:03:27.350> your

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480 
phone so I suggest going into settings

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:32.199 
phone so I suggest going into settings
general<00:03:30.050> accessibility<00:03:30.580> and<00:03:31.580> then<00:03:31.940> you<00:03:32.030> need

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:32.209 
general accessibility and then you need

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:34.960 
general accessibility and then you need
to<00:03:32.390> turn<00:03:32.690> on<00:03:32.989> your<00:03:33.410> reduced<00:03:33.709> motion<00:03:34.250> so<00:03:34.790> just

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:34.970 
to turn on your reduced motion so just

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:36.460 
to turn on your reduced motion so just
turn<00:03:35.120> that<00:03:35.180> on<00:03:35.360> and<00:03:35.540> it<00:03:35.900> will<00:03:36.019> stop<00:03:36.230> that

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470 
turn that on and it will stop that

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:38.380 
turn that on and it will stop that
movement<00:03:36.920> so<00:03:37.370> now<00:03:37.519> when<00:03:37.700> you<00:03:37.850> actually<00:03:38.060> go<00:03:38.330> to

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:38.390 
movement so now when you actually go to
