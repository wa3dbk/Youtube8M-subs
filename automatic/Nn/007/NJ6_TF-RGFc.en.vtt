00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:19.960
 hi to all tube people today are 

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:22.090
 me who say b with you for a new clip 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:25.210
 in history 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:28.090
 today we will talk about a cardboard that 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:30.399
 surely all of you know and that 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:35.500
 surely it has entertained you since 

00:00:30.399 --> 00:00:37.270
 early age did you know that the fox has a 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.579
 strange way of counting the episodes of the 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:41.739
 simpsons sometimes there then counted them 

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:43.450
 a couple taking the number senseless 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:45.130
 total episodes 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:48.490
 the reason for this if not episode 

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:50.230
 lost of the first season to find 

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:51.670
 details recalls the missing episode is 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:53.500
 very difficult 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:55.630
 we do not like what we have treated you 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.340
 very talk about it for what it is 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:58.930
 managed to reconstruct the episode 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:01.720
 lost would have been written 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:04.000
 entirely from matt groening during the 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:05.860
 production of the first season but 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.970
 begins to behave strangely 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:13.240
 he was very silent he seemed nervous and 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:15.159
 almost sick to mention this to whom 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:18.880
 saw him in person only leads to 

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:21.130
 make them angry and not to order 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:24.429
 reporting it never admits the number 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:30.579
 episode reduction was 7 g 44 

00:01:24.429 --> 00:01:32.829
 the title was dead burt in addition to 

00:01:30.579 --> 00:01:34.509
 added anger asking questions 

00:01:32.829 --> 00:01:36.579
 I remind this to anyone who has 

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:38.530
 worked on the show will induce you to do 

00:01:36.579 --> 00:01:41.979
 anything for individuals to talk about it 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:42.369
 directly with me at an event for i 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:44.469
 fan 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:46.029
 I tried to follow him after he had 

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:48.219
 talked to the crowd to try 

00:01:46.029 --> 00:01:50.679
 possibly to talk to him alone while 

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:53.139
 left the building does not seem to go crazy 

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:55.389
 he did things here you can see 

00:01:53.139 --> 00:01:59.920
 simply dealing with a fan with 

00:01:55.389 --> 00:02:01.959
 However, an obsessed fan when 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:04.240
 I mentioned the missing pills is 

00:02:01.959 --> 00:02:08.500
 suddenly pale and started a 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:10.840
 shaking commander details of one almost 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.819
 on the verge of tears to the employer a 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.459
 piece of paper written on it 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:19.090
 something and then it will be given to precarious workers not 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:20.950
 ruin the episode with never again 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.379
 ticket he gave me 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:25.030
 contained web address which not 

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:28.420
 I will write for reasons what lives among 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:29.970
 very little or says address for me is 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:32.650
 appeared to come out completely black 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:33.670
 exceptions a third yellow a link of 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:35.800
 download 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:38.140
 I clicked on the download of a 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:40.450
 file to download the file my computer e 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:43.000
 reality begins that of mad virus 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:45.640
 worst I'd ever seen the referrals 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.750
 system did not work the whole computer 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.180
 not to be thrown away 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:50.260
 but before doing so I copied the file 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:52.150
 with cd 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:54.360
 i tried it was taken with true emptied e 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:56.980
 as I suspected the silvio episode 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:59.079
 the episode started like all the 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:00.630
 but the other is watching the animation 

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:03.370
 really bad 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:06.069
 if he had seen original animated by 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:09.370
 saint jean di ring the latest episodes 

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:12.040
 first series found it similar but 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:14.290
 even less stable it says was 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.489
 perfectly normal but the way 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:18.250
 the characters behaved is 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:21.340
 quite strange homer seemed more 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:24.579
 angry senior at the anxious ISS 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:29.799
 and bart seem pleased godio verso 

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:32.380
 those parents in that episode i 

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:34.560
 simpson made trips by plane and to 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:37.049
 the first act the plane was falling 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:40.209
 it was enough to fuck like a script 

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:42.340
 however, when they were actually 50s 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:44.250
 meters high from the ground beat 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:46.930
 you found yourself being sucked out 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:49.569
 at the beginning of the matte series of the idea 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:52.060
 of animation the sims represented the 

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:52.959
 life and that the mort would have made everything 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:55.959
 more realistic 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:57.720
 the idea was tinged episode la 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:04:01.120
 figure the corpse to barely beat 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:03.250
 recognizable the designers invited 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:05.500
 full advantage because they didn't have to 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:07.450
 animate it realize a drawing of the 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:12.130
 corpse almost as realistic as one 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:14.160
 photo the first act ended with 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:17.049
 the framing that the bard corpse 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:19.120
 already contain the second act for marge 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:19.810
 lisa and also the return to the table e 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:22.660
 cried 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:24.370
 the plant continued without stopping e 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:27.220
 as it went on it became 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:30.010
 pluralistic and more grieved one of the 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:31.450
 Dubbing I'd ever heard 

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:33.849
 the animation gradually lost 

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:37.240
 quality then cried 

00:04:33.849 --> 00:04:38.770
 you may have to say mormons in the background the 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:42.189
 candles continue throughout the second 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:43.899
 act the third other served one 

00:04:42.189 --> 00:04:44.229
 screenshot that said that a was passed 

00:04:43.899 --> 00:04:47.709
 year 

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:51.959
 homer marge lisa with skeletal will eat 

00:04:47.709 --> 00:04:54.129
 sign 20 mag i in animals decided 

00:04:51.959 --> 00:04:56.139
 decided to go and visit the 

00:04:54.129 --> 00:04:58.629
 part tomb then film was 

00:04:56.139 --> 00:05:00.369
 completely deserted and mother close 

00:04:58.629 --> 00:05:03.209
 cemetery the houses grew more and more 

00:05:00.369 --> 00:05:06.580
 decrepit, they all seemed abandoned 

00:05:03.209 --> 00:05:09.099
 when we arrived you talk but they come to 

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:11.979
 tomb of the barrel body lay of 

00:05:09.099 --> 00:05:16.119
 in front of it exactly in technique 

00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:17.349
 how do you see the end of the first act la 

00:05:16.119 --> 00:05:20.879
 family began to long a 

00:05:17.349 --> 00:05:23.830
 crying again movie ai stopped 

00:05:20.879 --> 00:05:26.529
 they simply looked at the corpse from 

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:28.300
 camera zuma immediately where it can be said 

00:05:26.529 --> 00:05:30.429
 assumed work would have made a joke 

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:32.679
 that point is always nothing in the 

00:05:30.429 --> 00:05:34.779
 version I've seen I can't tell 

00:05:32.679 --> 00:05:37.479
 what the zoom said so yes 

00:05:34.779 --> 00:05:39.550
 away I think the episode is the temps 

00:05:37.479 --> 00:05:42.339
 and in the background at 12 above us all 

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:44.889
 this decided alcohol and was not there 

00:05:42.339 --> 00:05:47.469
 heard about 89 others 

00:05:44.889 --> 00:05:49.569
 appear on all there is the date of death 

00:05:47.469 --> 00:05:52.539
 some rooms that would die after type 

00:05:49.569 --> 00:05:55.169
 michael jackson and george harrison 

00:05:52.539 --> 00:05:57.759
 there is the exact date of their death 

00:05:55.169 --> 00:06:00.309
 you could try using stones 

00:05:57.759 --> 00:06:02.889
 tombs to predict the deaths of two Sardinians 

00:06:00.309 --> 00:06:05.649
 you are still alive will act something 

00:06:02.889 --> 00:06:10.199
 strange and those that have not 

00:06:05.649 --> 00:06:10.199
 deaths from death was exactly the same 

00:06:11.129 --> 00:06:14.279
 good guys 

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:23.130
 what do you think this clip i 

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:27.050
 planks me was a right to see 

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:29.820
 if I can say blindfold and Axa tor fishing 

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:36.270
 who kindly suggested this to us 

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:40.260
 pp history of today what you think of it 

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:45.200
 will be true will be false as many of you 

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:48.330
 they normally think of the three farmers 

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:49.770
 this will let you imagine it to you and 

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:52.530
 try to write in the comments and 

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:56.570
 you think it can be a real thing 

00:06:52.530 --> 00:07:02.280
 or a completely invented lie 

00:06:56.570 --> 00:07:04.140
 well with this I leave you and there 

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:08.090

00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:08.090
 study hi everyone
