00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.750
 it does not have much light, the grass is scarce and the terrain irregular but for many 

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:10.199
 Argentineans this field is special 

00:00:10.199 --> 00:00:13.619
 it was here as these children do now where lionel messi gave the 

00:00:13.619 --> 00:00:17.000
 first steps to become twice winner of the best prize 

00:00:16.999 --> 00:00:19.999
 world player 

00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:25.179
 broad 

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:28.929
 in the grandoli court located in a humble neighborhood of rosario about 300 

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:31.759
 kilometers north of buenos aires 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:35.600
 who saw it here about 18 years ago were left with a memory 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.330
 unforgettable 

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:40.330
 the technical capacity he had in front of haiti 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:47.310
 it is practically thing quique lie well the hour rooms and already with five years 

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:50.650
 with the ball and the field to the knees 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:54.310
 it will be directed it was amazing to see a creature being the things said 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.770
 and at that time in chairs and rivers in something bad 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.710
 has been fixed 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.080
 In the past many coaches of children's teams are looking for 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.770
 next maradona but now they look for is the next leonel messi for 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.700
 many here the young attacker of Barcelona already surpassed his compatriot 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:18.380
 It was on this street where Messi grew up but now his millionaire sometimes 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.040
 but and his family will still stay here when they come on holiday to rosario 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.219
 It's not a wealthy neighborhood 

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:27.269
 the place where he grew up suffers the problems of poverty and insecurity 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.220
 but this was not the main challenge in Messi's life 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:35.990
 At age 11 the young Argentine played in the lower ranks of this club 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:39.740
 iu the sun boys one of the biggest rosary teams 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:44.730
 at that time he was taken to see this man an endocrinologist because 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.020
 that his small stature could threaten or a football career 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:49.420
 promising 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:52.540
 well the lions studies determined that I had a deficit of 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:55.540
 growth hormone 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.590
 what should be done has remembered 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.470
 It is a costly treatment for all times since they exist 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.150
 at that time and now it's a treatment 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:11.310
 No team in Argentina wanted or could pay the thousand dollars a month 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.240
 treatment 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:16.209
 it was 2001 and the country was mired in a serious economic crisis 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:20.599
 it was then when the barcelona aware of the talent of messi intervened 

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:24.379
 he assumed the cost of the therapy and took the players his family Spain 

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:27.379
 where he became the star of today 

00:02:28.259 --> 00:02:31.969
 here in rosario a month and is an idol despite leaving the city ten years ago 

00:02:31.969 --> 00:02:32.749
 years 

00:02:32.749 --> 00:02:33.890
 and the Rosario 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:36.890
 they continue with expectation their matches in europe 

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:41.120
 the final of the league of champions this Saturday in wembley will not be a 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.849
 exception 

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:45.430
 for many locals it is an opportunity to see the little boy who was 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:49.359
 known as the flea and which is now on its way to becoming a legend 

00:02:50.979 --> 00:02:53.650
