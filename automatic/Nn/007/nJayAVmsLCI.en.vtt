00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:35.100
 a second you need to cut the cups here 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.989
 These are the beginnings of the scars.

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:55.379
 put dill on the bottom 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:57.799

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:01.290

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:50.460
 dill and garlic again take salt 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:53.610
 2 tablespoons of salt without the usual slides 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:55.320

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:01.799
 I measure it like this with a mug 2 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:03.990
 tablespoons of salt per liter of water and there 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:11.450
 look at the number of cucumbers which 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:15.750
 you do dissolve salt 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:17.930
 prevented until completely dissolved when 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:20.790
 the layer is completely dissolved 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:23.760
 we occupy our cucumbers 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:26.550

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:29.370
