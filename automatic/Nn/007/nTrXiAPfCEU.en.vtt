00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 You know that friend or mother-in-law's guess. 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.839
 You never know if it's true or lie. 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.280
 the experts consulted experts for 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:11.040
 know what the popular councils are 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.360
 that are really true and which ones 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.730
 they are nothing more than a stick 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.820
 check the strip to the left of this plant 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.650
 passages there is no left lane one 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.310
 Bearing game track like all 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.320
 too much 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.180
 what can not is you 're traveling 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.160
 the left lane sees a vehicle 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.619
 back with a velocity above your 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.500
 even to be above the permitted 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.000
 that way had allowed the speed 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.760
 100 miles per hour in one 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.800
 vehicle at 140 per hour behind you 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.020
 the legislation says that you are obliged to 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.489
 to pass the question on if he is 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.829
 infringing the law or not is a 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:47.129
 problem he's going to have to turn around 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:50.340
 autuador body with a case DMV df the 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:52.710
 body that takes care of that path and 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.140
 save fuel in general 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.510
 you save with the 15 because when your 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.920
 car is in neutral the engine is 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.620
 running at idle then 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.239
 fuel consumption is low and the car 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.010
 walking normally 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.560
 now if you have a very descent 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:10.080
 steep reward you engage a 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.600
 instead of using the brake because 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.950
 in which case the motor automatically 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.259
 cut fuel 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.729
 so he does not consume anything his car 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.460
 also the displacement 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.530
 besides it ends up saving brake is 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.020
 systems have nowadays been 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.549
 automated systems on the cars he 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.470
 engages the Goiana 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.659
 some banking hitch systems arrive 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:33.060
 turn off the engine to the baby's seat 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:35.610
 Can not go in the front seat. 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.680
 there are two situations in which the 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.759
 baby's car seat can go ahead in the 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.439
 front seat 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.880
 those vehicles with only one seat 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:44.189
 as the trucks by 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.799
 example in this case it is allowed 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:49.470
 second situation in which all banks 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:50.790
 rear we already have three children 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.550
 in the rear seat and 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.590
 it is necessary to carry a fourth child 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:57.510
 then in this case when we have four 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.120
 children within a vehicle to which 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:01.950
 will be placed in the 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:04.860
 the front seat and then following the same 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.960
 rules if you will need to use 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.310
 baby-comfort chair depending on the 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.720
 her age 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:13.350
 walk away with air conditioning off 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:16.110
 decrease consumption 5 less consumption 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:17.790
 the air conditioning and operates with compressor 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.920
 coupled to the motor 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.940
 so when you are not using the air 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.220
 conditioning 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.950
 this compressor is not working and 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.870
 does not have an overload on the motor is 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:31.950
 Forbidden to walk with headlamp on 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:34.020
 the day are no less one of the fears 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.970
 there are even situations 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:37.200
 where it is mandatory to use the headlamp 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.420
 even during the day 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:42.660
 in the case of the engine cycle of 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:44.340
 collective transport of passengers and 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.930
 another situation, for example, you 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.989
 is passing in a tunnel 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.430
 in which case all these cases are 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:51.300
 mandatory headlight use even during 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:53.670
 the day 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:56.580
 The flex car needs to put gas from 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:58.260
 once in a while you do not need to put 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:01.200
 gasoline unless there is a 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:03.930
 manufacturer's recommendation does not 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:06.299
 never take care of gas with the car 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:07.980
 flex is prohibited with the alert flash 

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:10.290
 connected to the mist 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:13.049
 not can not legislation does not allow 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:15.810
 this and on the contrary some other 

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:18.510
 that this is possible in cases where 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:19.920
 of abrupt traffic stop or 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:21.540
 has any traffic situation where 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:23.400
 You'll have to stop very quickly. 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:25.920
 so to avoid cluttering in that 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.989
 In case you can call, you must call the 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:29.610
 warning light and in those cases where the 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:31.980
 way signaling allows you to 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:34.170
 park but stay with the flashing alert 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:36.360
 connected while you are standing at the 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:38.140
 suitable place for parking 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:41.110
 park with the carriage engaged 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:41.860
 helps to secure the car helps 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:44.890
 to hold 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:46.660
 You stop the car and engage a march. 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:49.300
 if you have any problem with the brake 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:52.660
 hand brake or if the hand brake is not 

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:55.690
 regulated it will support the displacement 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:04:00.280
 of the car on the drive driving barefoot 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:04:02.560
 generates a fine I do not issue driving barefoot 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:04.510
 allowed what can not in case you 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:06.370
 using shoes that do not 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:07.930
 firm on the foot eg slippers 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:10.270
 sandals that do not have that tab 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:12.970
 that you really hold onto your foot next to the 

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:16.120
 shoes also clog and high heels 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:17.700
 all these shoes can not 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:20.350
 because it will harm for example 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:22.770
 hosting use of the series of 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:25.510
 on the spines impairs the 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:26.650
 does not prejudice your past 

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:29.350
 side in the lumbar 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:31.030
 the suspension it works but when you 

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:34.419
 pass by 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:36.970
 so you do not live that one 

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:38.830
 perfection in the street between the two 

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:41.770
 will pass simultaneously on the spine 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:44.440
 of the alcohol mouthwash liquor 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:47.530
 bonbon to take the sony 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:49.300
 It is a myth to us and you already have several 

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:51.130
 people's tests can do this in 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:53.830
 home has no problem what can 

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:55.660
 in the extreme case you end up putting yourself 

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:56.260
 xavante in the mouth and then make a 

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:57.910
 source 

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:59.770
 and it is obvious that this is not the case in 

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:00.370
 blitz in surveillance operations 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:02.470
 detran 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:04.930
 even though the person still declares 

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:07.330
 Look, I just put the oral Xavante and 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:09.610
 I was stopped two seconds later. 

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:11.290
 problem in all these cases the police officer 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:13.330
 the detran agent 

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:15.669
 it will give a period of 10 to 15 minutes 

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:18.310
 for you to redo or test for 

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:20.320
 first time and you have any questions 

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:21.039
 would like to know if they can send 

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:23.880
 truth 

00:05:21.039 --> 00:05:23.880
 write in comments 

00:05:23.889 --> 00:05:30.689
 liked this video so short and 

00:05:26.169 --> 00:05:30.689
 share there and cars have much more 

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:48.530
 the body
