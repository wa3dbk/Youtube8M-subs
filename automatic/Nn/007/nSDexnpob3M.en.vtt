one of the best and probably the best
rank<00:01:22.110> 6<00:01:22.560> but<00:01:23.189> there's<00:01:24.150> a<00:01:24.210> catch<00:01:24.570> this<00:01:25.470> card<00:01:25.740> can

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
rank 6 but there's a catch this card can

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.830 
rank 6 but there's a catch this card can
only<00:01:25.950> be<00:01:26.220> someone<00:01:26.670> with<00:01:26.880> to<00:01:27.240> level<00:01:27.600> 6

spellcaster-type monsters and this

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.450 
spellcaster-type monsters and this
really<00:01:30.540> brings<00:01:30.869> the<00:01:31.200> quality<00:01:31.680> of<00:01:31.710> a<00:01:31.890> card<00:01:32.130> down

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
really brings the quality of a card down

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.429 
really brings the quality of a card down
because<00:01:32.909> there<00:01:33.090> are<00:01:33.150> only<00:01:33.270> certain<00:01:33.689> decks<00:01:34.140> I

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
because there are only certain decks I

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.440 
because there are only certain decks I
can<00:01:35.009> actually<00:01:35.130> summon<00:01:35.640> this<00:01:35.729> card<00:01:35.939> it's<00:01:36.150> very

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
can actually summon this card it's very

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.600 
can actually summon this card it's very
disappointing<00:01:36.720> considering<00:01:37.680> how<00:01:38.070> good<00:01:38.430> it<00:01:38.579> is

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
certain are types what I think should be

overpowered or under pardon what not and

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.560 
overpowered or under pardon what not and
I<00:01:54.780> just<00:01:54.960> think<00:01:55.170> this<00:01:55.259> moral<00:01:55.619> leader<00:01:55.799> card<00:01:56.159> is

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:56.570 
I just think this moral leader card is

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:00.590 
I just think this moral leader card is
very<00:01:57.570> it's<00:01:58.229> gonna<00:01:58.350> be<00:01:58.500> very<00:01:58.530> underused<00:01:59.430> and<00:01:59.759> I

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
very it's gonna be very underused and I

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.749 
very it's gonna be very underused and I
just<00:02:00.869> don't<00:02:01.049> feel<00:02:01.200> it<00:02:01.710> needs<00:02:01.920> to<00:02:02.250> be<00:02:02.369> attached

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
just don't feel it needs to be attached

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:07.540 
more lead I just see that becoming its

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:09.259 
more lead I just see that becoming its
own<00:04:07.690> thing<00:04:08.049> whatever<00:04:08.290> it<00:04:08.470> can<00:04:08.739> be<00:04:08.920> played<00:04:09.160> in

00:04:09.259 --> 00:04:09.269 
own thing whatever it can be played in

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:12.780 
own thing whatever it can be played in
spellcaster<00:04:10.269> decks<00:04:10.739> overall<00:04:11.739> I<00:04:12.130> can't<00:04:12.459> help

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:12.790 
spellcaster decks overall I can't help

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:14.699 
spellcaster decks overall I can't help
but<00:04:12.940> feel<00:04:13.090> really<00:04:13.780> disappointed<00:04:13.989> in<00:04:14.530> these

00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:14.709 
but feel really disappointed in these

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:16.409 
but feel really disappointed in these
cards<00:04:15.190> I<00:04:15.280> think<00:04:15.489> no<00:04:15.609> other<00:04:15.940> moral<00:04:16.239> leader

00:04:16.409 --> 00:04:16.419 
cards I think no other moral leader

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:18.990 
cards I think no other moral leader
would<00:04:17.229> be<00:04:17.380> a<00:04:17.410> hell<00:04:17.829> of<00:04:17.859> a<00:04:18.010> lot<00:04:18.160> more<00:04:18.190> viable<00:04:18.700> if

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:19.000 
would be a hell of a lot more viable if

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.930 
would be a hell of a lot more viable if
it<00:04:19.120> was<00:04:19.389> just<00:04:19.419> a<00:04:19.720> straight<00:04:20.229> out<00:04:20.440> normal<00:04:21.340> rank<00:04:21.609> 6

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:21.940 
it was just a straight out normal rank 6

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:24.360 
it was just a straight out normal rank 6
I<00:04:22.060> mean<00:04:22.210> rank<00:04:22.450> 6<00:04:22.720> aren't<00:04:23.200> that<00:04:23.320> comment<00:04:23.770> anyway

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:24.370 
I mean rank 6 aren't that comment anyway

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:26.160 
I mean rank 6 aren't that comment anyway
why<00:04:25.120> would<00:04:25.360> you<00:04:25.390> then<00:04:25.720> limit

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:26.170 
why would you then limit

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:28.650 
why would you then limit
it<00:04:26.290> two<00:04:26.500> spell<00:04:26.740> casters<00:04:26.980> I<00:04:27.400> just<00:04:27.700> I<00:04:27.940> just<00:04:28.270> don't

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:28.660 
it two spell casters I just I just don't

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:30.750 
it two spell casters I just I just don't
get<00:04:28.780> that<00:04:28.840> at<00:04:28.960> all<00:04:29.200> and<00:04:29.500> then<00:04:29.590> the<00:04:29.740> chaos<00:04:30.100> XYZ<00:04:30.730> I

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:30.760 
get that at all and then the chaos XYZ I

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:33.600 
get that at all and then the chaos XYZ I
just<00:04:31.120> think<00:04:31.420> is<00:04:31.750> pretty<00:04:32.350> useless<00:04:32.710> compared<00:04:33.340> to

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:33.610 
just think is pretty useless compared to

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:36.480 
just think is pretty useless compared to
the<00:04:33.870> normal<00:04:34.870> XYZ<00:04:35.380> and<00:04:35.530> that's<00:04:35.740> what<00:04:35.950> a<00:04:36.190> lot<00:04:36.430> of

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:36.490 
the normal XYZ and that's what a lot of

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:39.840 
the normal XYZ and that's what a lot of
these<00:04:36.760> chaos<00:04:37.390> XYZ<00:04:38.020> s<00:04:38.080> are<00:04:38.530> starting<00:04:39.220> to<00:04:39.250> do

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:39.850 
these chaos XYZ s are starting to do

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:43.920 
these chaos XYZ s are starting to do
it's<00:04:40.780> a<00:04:40.840> big<00:04:41.110> mistake<00:04:41.320> I<00:04:41.740> mean<00:04:42.510> that<00:04:43.510> they're

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:43.930 
it's a big mistake I mean that they're

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:47.850 
it's a big mistake I mean that they're
taking<00:04:44.170> the<00:04:44.530> normal<00:04:45.300> XYZ<00:04:46.300> they<00:04:46.510> have<00:04:46.810> and<00:04:47.500> it's

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:47.860 
taking the normal XYZ they have and it's

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:49.860 
taking the normal XYZ they have and it's
meant<00:04:48.160> to<00:04:48.280> upgrade<00:04:48.760> its<00:04:49.030> meant<00:04:49.330> to<00:04:49.420> make<00:04:49.690> it

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:49.870 
meant to upgrade its meant to make it

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:53.010 
meant to upgrade its meant to make it
better<00:04:50.050> but<00:04:50.730> all<00:04:51.730> I<00:04:51.790> see<00:04:52.030> them<00:04:52.570> doing<00:04:52.780> is

better but all I see them doing is

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:55.470 
better but all I see them doing is
making<00:04:53.230> it<00:04:53.500> worse<00:04:53.680> you<00:04:54.130> know<00:04:54.280> so<00:04:55.030> to<00:04:55.210> conclude
