00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:13.670
 during the execution of the exercise 

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:15.889
 of genetics open as the analyst in 

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:18.610
 scene a quadriceps simulation the 

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:21.380
 weight placed level of tibia stalls 

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:23.920
 determines a prior transaction 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:26.949
 tibial dish which it opposes 

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:29.930
 full anterior cruciate ligament 

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:32.620
 the injured forces from which he subjected this 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:36.110
 ligament determines to advise against 

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:39.470
 absolutely such exercise in subjects 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:41.750
 post operated or subjects with injuries 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:45.470
 of the cruciate or problematic ligament 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:47.600
 now differently during an exercise 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:50.650
 kinetic chain closed as can be 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:53.390
 squat the foot anchored to the ground 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:55.750
 increases the compaction force between the 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:58.339
 articular surfaces of tibia and femur 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:02.299
 besides the activation of the musculature 

00:00:58.339 --> 00:01:04.519
 plural disk also activated by 

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:06.470
 bending the trunk forward what 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:08.930
 it doesn't happen during the shakes with the 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:10.760
 straight back to the multipower has the 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:12.350
 function to protect the joint 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:15.100
 to help the cruciate ligament 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:17.659
 front resulting in a slip 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:19.399
 posterior tibia that opposes a 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:21.770
 the front one clearly loaded 

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:23.659
 nesi di su legamento 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:26.240
 in conclusion during chain exercises 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:28.220
 kinetic open the only brake frame 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.170
 placed at the front translation of the 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:32.780
 silvia is the resistance of the 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:34.520
 anterior cruciate ligament during se 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:37.460
 excesses of kinetic chain closed instead 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:39.040
 the arrow and set aside in the 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.480
 choral risk contraction 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:43.550
 guarantee protective forces for 

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:45.850
 articulation and greater stability 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:45.850
 of the knee
