00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:14.790
 hi previous comments mind is very 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.860
 but very well and I bring a video of 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.720
 innate outfits that already know that I am 

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:20.369
 very bad that your advice 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.430
 They asked for this return to school 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:26.130
 belly to wing to school then 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:29.009
 they are trying to upload two videos 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.869
 per week or maybe nothing else one this 

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:32.579
 but yes then let's watch video now 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.739
 finish I'll give you some tips 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.620
 let's start with the hairstyles for 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.480
 the first one we are going to make three pigtails 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.230
 let's divide our hair first 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.290
 in 3 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.420
 let's do one back and have to 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.760
 Being high or low depends on how 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.770
 you want the chongo after we're going to do 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.520
 others on both sides to try to 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.520
 stay back 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:09.880
 Something like that should stay with us and then 

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:09.880
 let's trade the three pigtails and so 

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:21.659
 Sun 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.729
 and then we're going to make a sound with 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.829
 the three of us are going to wind it up between 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.500
 each one and we will explore them with 

00:01:25.829 --> 00:01:30.630
 pins and so on and then you can 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.330
 putting a bow is what you want and 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.720
 all for this hairstyle 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:35.720
 look 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.460
 without more 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:46.630
 no no 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.300
 but the second hairstyle we're just going to 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.280
 make a tall ponytail but let's leave 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:55.410
 the section as from next in front of 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.440
 our hair the pigtail can be 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:59.400
 as high as low as you like 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:01.800
 then we will start making a 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:06.290
 press we are going to braid three times and 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:06.290
 let's grab a part below 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.910
 and we are going to add it to this strong 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:15.270
 after we continue braiding we can 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:17.220
 add a little bit on the other side and 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:19.230
 we give him until the end of the 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:22.100
 hair and then after and only 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.100
 we finished with a braid 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:36.490
 then we just roll that little braid 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:39.340
 around our queue and now 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:41.500
 we can with pins and it's super 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:43.890
 super father and then he is super super 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.890
 father 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:53.670
 for the third hairstyle is super super 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:55.140
 easy we are going to make a tousled chamo 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.970
 if you do not like hairstyles something 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:58.740
 perfect but I do not like it 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:01.260
 combing me I like everything is styled and so 

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:04.390
 that's why I did action then we're going to 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:06.310
 make all braids like this 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:08.420
 way down until it reaches 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:10.400
 down the castle 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:13.190
 and then we will deal with it later 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:15.440
 pins on the other side of our head 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:17.660
 or if it does not reach you then only half of 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:19.400
 head but because I liked how 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:22.190
 do as a half day type for 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:23.840
 back I do not know and then only natural to the other 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:26.349
 side of your head as shown in 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:26.349
 this image 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:43.270
 besides comments with the outfits 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:45.730
 for the first one, the only thing I did was 

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:47.290
 put me a stands and so super comfortable 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:51.400
 because I always go like school 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:54.130
 a not pretty florist blouse I put on a 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:57.240
 vest if it becomes cold and 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:57.240
 because you have tennis 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:09.590
 I put a gray one pink blouse a 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:11.840
 sweater a bow and like little pieces for the 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:13.670
 cold and like that and this for the cepi flame 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:17.359
 management and so I am very comfortable in the 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:19.130
 This last school I ask you to be at 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:21.890
 girls removed put me a skirt 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:23.380
 skinner and black a blouse like rosita and 

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:25.630
 A) Yes 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:27.970
 of my lenses and so are the classes 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:31.120
 normalized but if you do not like to carry 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:34.140
 can you take something under then 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:34.140
 the country 

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:52.310
 advice that I wanted to give you so are 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:55.400
 basic and more to enter the school 

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:57.620
 while a new school today as tea 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:59.450
 organic and realizarte and so I 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:01.820
 you are going to enter some new school you see 

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:03.890
 new and it scares you as well as doing 

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:05.840
 friends try it because seriously it's 

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:07.910
 super father to me I have been given a lot 

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:09.500
 sorry then I tried and found my 

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:11.990
 seven best friends in high school 

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:14.210
 so if I try to make friends though 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:16.430
 I have a lot of grief with taleb hello how 

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:18.320
 your name is that you stay with the leg 

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:21.320
 like this and so you'll be able to make friends 

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:23.270
 very easily the second advice that 

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:24.740
 I give them is that you yourselves are not 

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:27.050
 They must pretend I know someone else 

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:29.570
 you are what you are and that is how it is 

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:31.730
 father and you can catch many tips like that 

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:35.240
 how about how to organize ourselves good I 

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:37.340
 Keep me organized with a folder 

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:39.740
 the folders will save their lives 

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:41.990
 but here you can get us homework 

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:44.480
 jobs delivered jobs by 

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:46.040
 deliver and then pieces of paper that sell you 

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:48.380
 at school if this is what you can 

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:51.289
 so it's super easy to be skinny not 

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:54.319
 it weighs nothing and it is super easy 

00:05:51.289 --> 00:05:56.680
 everything easy everything quiet all cool other 

00:05:54.319 --> 00:05:59.240
 advice that I give them is to keep 

00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:00.439
 organized and attentive so reprogram me 

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:02.960
 matters because I never put 

00:06:00.439 --> 00:06:04.610
 Attention to what I was told to do 

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:06.740
 what they said and until the next day 

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:08.180
 it's always when I ask they left homework 

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:09.919
 where that would not be until the last 

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:11.389
 moment because that's what I was 

00:06:09.919 --> 00:06:13.909
 it happened that everything goes to the last moment 

00:06:11.389 --> 00:06:15.889
 projects tasks all the last moment 

00:06:13.909 --> 00:06:17.839
 and then it was like he made me a 

00:06:15.889 --> 00:06:19.759
 very large work load expressed me 

00:06:17.839 --> 00:06:22.909
 three given a lot a scholar about a 

00:06:19.759 --> 00:06:25.909
 agenda and then I'll try this no 

00:06:22.909 --> 00:06:27.830
 I am for example I have to make some 

00:06:25.909 --> 00:06:30.949
 math exercises to read a 

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:32.089
 thing and Spanish then well now I 

00:06:30.949 --> 00:06:33.919
 I'm going to put to do and when I already 

00:06:32.089 --> 00:06:36.800
 I finished doing so I'm going to mark it 

00:06:33.919 --> 00:06:39.919
 well with brand texts or radios something 

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:41.779
 something like that so that it is already attentive I of 

00:06:39.919 --> 00:06:43.039
 that despite the fact that they say that they no longer owe me 

00:06:41.779 --> 00:06:44.689
 worry I do not recommend that 

00:06:43.039 --> 00:06:46.039
 enjoy this stage of your life if today 

00:06:44.689 --> 00:06:47.809

00:06:46.039 --> 00:06:50.330
 preparatory because they are from the stages 

00:06:47.809 --> 00:06:52.339
 where as most beautiful friends where such 

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:54.289
 Once you find your first love in the 

00:06:52.339 --> 00:06:55.969

00:06:54.289 --> 00:06:57.740
 I recommend all that, what 

00:06:55.969 --> 00:07:00.199
 Enjoy a lot and do not be afraid 

00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:03.080
 scared but I was taking little away 

00:07:00.199 --> 00:07:04.490
 little and as they could already see against 

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:05.330
 best people I could have met 

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:07.130

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:09.560

00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:10.880
