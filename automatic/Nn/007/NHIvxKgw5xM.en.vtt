hey Wiley here and I'm going to show you
project<00:00:09.190> spooky<00:00:09.519> this<00:00:10.240> is<00:00:10.420> pretty<00:00:10.599> much<00:00:10.750> the

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:10.900 
project spooky this is pretty much the

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:12.089 
project spooky this is pretty much the
first<00:00:11.049> project<00:00:11.590> that<00:00:11.709> we're<00:00:11.799> going<00:00:11.920> to<00:00:12.010> get

00:00:12.089 --> 00:00:12.099 
first project that we're going to get

00:00:12.099 --> 00:00:17.580 
first project that we're going to get
started<00:00:12.490> on<00:00:12.580> here<00:00:13.709> this<00:00:14.709> is<00:00:14.770> a<00:00:15.180> 1985<00:00:16.180> VF<00:00:16.750> 700<00:00:17.439> F

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:17.590 
started on here this is a 1985 VF 700 F

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:22.440 
started on here this is a 1985 VF 700 F
interceptor<00:00:19.800> it's<00:00:20.800> really<00:00:21.430> not<00:00:21.640> in<00:00:21.910> that<00:00:22.180> bad

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:22.450 
interceptor it's really not in that bad

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:23.970 
interceptor it's really not in that bad
of<00:00:22.480> shape<00:00:22.660> and<00:00:23.020> it's<00:00:23.140> got<00:00:23.260> relatively<00:00:23.710> low

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:23.980 
of shape and it's got relatively low

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:27.900 
of shape and it's got relatively low
miles<00:00:25.710> wound<00:00:26.710> up<00:00:26.890> picking<00:00:27.070> this<00:00:27.340> up<00:00:27.520> from<00:00:27.820> a

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:27.910 
miles wound up picking this up from a

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:30.750 
miles wound up picking this up from a
guy<00:00:28.150> that<00:00:28.600> wrecked<00:00:28.930> his<00:00:29.410> and<00:00:29.860> he<00:00:30.340> bought<00:00:30.550> this

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:30.760 
guy that wrecked his and he bought this

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:32.910 
guy that wrecked his and he bought this
for<00:00:31.150> spare<00:00:31.570> parts<00:00:31.990> and<00:00:32.169> for<00:00:32.439> some<00:00:32.590> reason

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:32.920 
for spare parts and for some reason

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.650 
for spare parts and for some reason
never<00:00:33.039> actually<00:00:33.340> used<00:00:33.760> it<00:00:33.969> so<00:00:34.120> we<00:00:34.210> got<00:00:34.359> pretty

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:34.660 
never actually used it so we got pretty

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:37.139 
never actually used it so we got pretty
much<00:00:34.780> a<00:00:34.809> complete<00:00:35.289> bike<00:00:36.059> smithing<00:00:37.059> the

00:00:37.139 --> 00:00:37.149 
much a complete bike smithing the

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:38.489 
much a complete bike smithing the
radiators<00:00:37.600> but<00:00:37.749> we<00:00:37.839> have<00:00:37.960> a<00:00:37.989> lot<00:00:38.199> of<00:00:38.229> donor

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:38.499 
radiators but we have a lot of donor

00:00:38.499 --> 00:00:41.160 
radiators but we have a lot of donor
bikes<00:00:38.800> here<00:00:39.039> for<00:00:39.309> it<00:00:39.690> we're<00:00:40.690> calling<00:00:40.899> this

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:41.170 
bikes here for it we're calling this

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:45.149 
bikes here for it we're calling this
project<00:00:41.710> spooky<00:00:43.079> because<00:00:44.079> of<00:00:44.289> offer<00:00:44.769> one<00:00:45.069> of

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:45.159 
project spooky because of offer one of

project spooky because of offer one of
the<00:00:45.249> donor<00:00:45.489> bikes<00:00:45.699> we<00:00:45.969> have<00:00:46.269> we<00:00:46.510> have<00:00:46.659> these

00:00:46.799 --> 00:00:46.809 
the donor bikes we have we have these

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:49.549 
the donor bikes we have we have these
really<00:00:47.679> nice<00:00:47.800> black<00:00:48.219> tanks<00:00:48.729> right<00:00:48.909> here<00:00:49.210> and

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
really nice black tanks right here and

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:55.529 
really nice black tanks right here and
there's<00:00:50.559> a<00:00:50.679> holographic<00:00:53.489> Sparkle<00:00:54.489> on<00:00:54.639> it

00:00:55.529 --> 00:00:55.539 
there's a holographic Sparkle on it

00:00:55.539 --> 00:00:56.879 
there's a holographic Sparkle on it
that's<00:00:55.749> probably<00:00:56.079> not<00:00:56.229> going<00:00:56.379> to<00:00:56.469> really<00:00:56.620> come

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:56.889 
that's probably not going to really come

00:00:56.889 --> 00:00:59.039 
that's probably not going to really come
out<00:00:56.920> too<00:00:57.190> great<00:00:57.519> on<00:00:57.729> this<00:00:58.089> video<00:00:58.479> here<00:00:58.780> but<00:00:58.929> if

00:00:59.039 --> 00:00:59.049 
out too great on this video here but if

00:00:59.049 --> 00:01:00.479 
out too great on this video here but if
you<00:00:59.139> look<00:00:59.289> at<00:00:59.409> the<00:00:59.469> pictures<00:00:59.829> you<00:00:59.979> can<00:01:00.129> see<00:01:00.370> it

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:00.489 
you look at the pictures you can see it

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:04.289 
you look at the pictures you can see it
and<00:01:00.670> then<00:01:01.600> below<00:01:02.530> that<00:01:03.010> has<00:01:03.399> been<00:01:03.879> airbrushed

00:01:04.289 --> 00:01:04.299 
and then below that has been airbrushed

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:07.080 
and then below that has been airbrushed
and<00:01:04.570> it<00:01:04.659> really<00:01:04.839> faintly<00:01:05.520> stars<00:01:06.520> and<00:01:06.850> a<00:01:06.880> bunch

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:07.090 
and it really faintly stars and a bunch

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:08.610 
and it really faintly stars and a bunch
of<00:01:07.180> ghosts<00:01:07.630> right<00:01:07.960> down<00:01:08.110> the<00:01:08.229> center<00:01:08.500> of<00:01:08.530> the

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:08.620 
of ghosts right down the center of the

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:14.640 
of ghosts right down the center of the
tank<00:01:09.300> so<00:01:10.680> hence<00:01:11.680> the<00:01:12.430> theme<00:01:13.290> this<00:01:14.290> bike<00:01:14.500> is

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:14.650 
tank so hence the theme this bike is

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:16.530 
tank so hence the theme this bike is
going<00:01:14.890> to<00:01:14.980> be<00:01:15.070> a<00:01:15.100> full<00:01:15.460> restoration<00:01:15.970> but<00:01:16.390> we

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:16.540 
going to be a full restoration but we

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:19.010 
going to be a full restoration but we
are<00:01:16.780> going<00:01:16.990> to<00:01:17.140> strip<00:01:17.380> this<00:01:17.530> down<00:01:17.670> bare

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
are going to strip this down bare

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.090 
are going to strip this down bare
repaint<00:01:20.020> the<00:01:20.170> frame<00:01:20.410> we<00:01:20.620> don't<00:01:20.770> hope<00:01:20.920> we're

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:21.100 
repaint the frame we don't hope we're

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.360 
repaint the frame we don't hope we're
going<00:01:21.220> to<00:01:21.280> keep<00:01:21.550> it<00:01:21.730> silver<00:01:22.000> go<00:01:22.300> black<00:01:23.220> to<00:01:24.220> go

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:24.370 
going to keep it silver go black to go

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:27.110 
going to keep it silver go black to go
with<00:01:24.550> a<00:01:24.580> theme<00:01:24.850> of<00:01:25.060> it<00:01:25.210> one<00:01:26.140> thing<00:01:26.380> that<00:01:26.560> I<00:01:26.590> am

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:27.120 
with a theme of it one thing that I am

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:30.500 
with a theme of it one thing that I am
really<00:01:28.120> seriously<00:01:28.510> thinking<00:01:29.350> of<00:01:29.500> doing<00:01:29.710> is

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:30.510 
really seriously thinking of doing is

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:35.000 
really seriously thinking of doing is
polishing<00:01:31.510> up<00:01:31.630> the<00:01:31.810> swing<00:01:32.230> arm<00:01:32.410> here<00:01:32.680> and<00:01:33.000> the

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:35.010 
polishing up the swing arm here and the

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:38.730 
polishing up the swing arm here and the
rear<00:01:36.010> sets<00:01:36.780> normally<00:01:37.780> I<00:01:37.810> want<00:01:38.050> to<00:01:38.140> do<00:01:38.350> that<00:01:38.560> on

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:38.740 
rear sets normally I want to do that on

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:43.500 
rear sets normally I want to do that on
an<00:01:38.860> interception<00:01:39.370> but<00:01:41.490> yet<00:01:42.490> again<00:01:42.820> one<00:01:43.330> of<00:01:43.360> the

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:43.510 
an interception but yet again one of the

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:46.310 
an interception but yet again one of the
donor<00:01:43.690> bites<00:01:43.990> had<00:01:44.680> an<00:01:45.070> old<00:01:45.550> Vance<00:01:45.790> &amp;<00:01:46.030> Hines

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
donor bites had an old Vance &amp; Hines

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.540 
donor bites had an old Vance &amp; Hines
Supersport<00:01:47.320> exhaust<00:01:47.650> on<00:01:47.920> it<00:01:50.070> and<00:01:51.070> there<00:01:51.460> will

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:51.550 
Supersport exhaust on it and there will

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:54.170 
Supersport exhaust on it and there will
be<00:01:51.580> better<00:01:52.000> pictures<00:01:52.450> of<00:01:52.630> this<00:01:52.780> too<00:01:53.070> but<00:01:54.070> uh

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
be better pictures of this too but uh

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:59.360 
be better pictures of this too but uh
the<00:01:55.180> pipe<00:01:56.080> is<00:01:56.320> really<00:01:56.920> kind<00:01:57.159> of<00:01:57.310> rotted<00:01:57.909> out

00:01:59.360 --> 00:01:59.370 
the pipe is really kind of rotted out

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:02.730 
the pipe is really kind of rotted out
but<00:02:00.370> with<00:02:00.640> a<00:02:00.670> little<00:02:00.940> bit<00:02:01.090> of<00:02:01.260> lovin<00:02:02.260> on<00:02:02.380> it<00:02:02.560> I

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:02.740 
but with a little bit of lovin on it I

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:04.890 
but with a little bit of lovin on it I
managed<00:02:03.250> to<00:02:03.280> get<00:02:03.760> it<00:02:03.909> polished<00:02:04.270> up<00:02:04.450> to<00:02:04.870> a

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:04.900 
managed to get it polished up to a

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:08.309 
managed to get it polished up to a
mirror<00:02:06.390> so<00:02:07.390> we're<00:02:07.570> going<00:02:07.690> to<00:02:07.750> do<00:02:07.870> that<00:02:08.019> to<00:02:08.200> both

00:02:08.309 --> 00:02:08.319 
mirror so we're going to do that to both

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:10.710 
mirror so we're going to do that to both
pipes<00:02:08.619> these<00:02:09.069> are<00:02:09.280> off<00:02:09.429> a<00:02:09.459> thousand<00:02:10.209> they<00:02:10.450> will

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720 
pipes these are off a thousand they will

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.750 
pipes these are off a thousand they will
fit<00:02:11.019> the<00:02:11.170> 750<00:02:11.830> it<00:02:11.950> just<00:02:12.159> takes<00:02:12.370> a<00:02:12.489> little<00:02:12.639> bit

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
fit the 750 it just takes a little bit

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.830 
fit the 750 it just takes a little bit
of<00:02:12.909> trickery<00:02:13.870> with<00:02:14.439> the<00:02:14.639> way<00:02:15.639> they<00:02:15.819> melt<00:02:16.329> to

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
of trickery with the way they melt to
