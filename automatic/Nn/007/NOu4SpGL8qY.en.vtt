00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:04.500
 at the rhythm 

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:12.870
 Hello everyone 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.130
 today we find ourselves on 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.410
 as long as I hope you are well 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.359
 so I'm fine on the turn 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.250
 so at the castle we end up with a 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.230
 new gameplay on pershing well 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.420
 sure again on the button that I 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.130
 know but the efforts do not feel 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.110
 disappoint my sticks over nine years that I 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.670
 am going to do a lot more good videos 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:31.650
 there it is sure certainly I had not done 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.739
 a lot b2g i'm doing a lot of 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.600
 videos but should increase my pace 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.179
 of videos so this gameplay is when 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.460
 even simply or that it is well 

00:00:39.179 --> 00:00:43.170
 some chefs and / or otc even my 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.699
 kiel record so some already knew 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.739
 what was my record of who the bank 

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:48.809
 Belgian was just beaten my 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.760
 key record so the at the end and 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.370
 I approach a lot of frei but otherwise 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.679
 normally the pershing gennari is 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.039
 not a shark game really cartoons 

00:00:55.679 --> 00:01:00.989
 a lot 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:03.780
 but the jetty I was really raging 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:07.140
 it was the really perfect part 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:10.260
 otherwise I was accompanied by raymond so 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:13.770
 if you prefer rem 54 so turn to 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:17.610
 both joined a little ago a 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.720
 team orlen royal excuse me royal 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.320
 shielding 59 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:24.800
 is it enough van basten not bad no regrets 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.570
 not to have had to have taken it otherwise 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:29.940
 why I'm talking to you about raises 54 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.710
 just not if there he just opened 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:33.360
 a youtube channel and will soon 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.890
 make videos since then so I 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.330
 you say for those that it could 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.790
 interest him of course he will do some 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:41.190
 very varied videos because all 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:44.850
 days we talk about that so I would not have 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:46.560
 talked about videos on I do not know what 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.940
 I could fly over this time 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.860
 I do not know that on a tablecloth 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:51.840
 when midi does not have a lot of gameplay 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.930
 exceptional to return only if it does 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.659
 not often more than 3.4 keane this one 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.270
 always 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:59.710
 and often die and it does not press very 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:03.159
 serious 5 the time and finally you are 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:04.929
 but these videos would be very varied so 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:06.539
 if you are interested his channel will be 

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:08.860
 in the description 

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:10.000
 if not I'll tap you back together 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.269
 face the gameplay well only 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.340
 interesting from that moment on 

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:17.860
 so as you have already noticed 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.720
 is it was rather everyone 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:22.690
 it'll be tight to the game honestly 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.430
 the person can not predict who was going 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:26.680
 gain a few places and is that 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.290
 until the end it was honestly when 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.610
 I returned to the game Thursday 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:33.640
 after a party park there my 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:37.060
 opinion for me on the contrary it was my 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:38.560
 best part good we do not know so 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:40.629
 for example here we are the three 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.160
 on an amx but good catch the base 

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:44.440
 will want to impose already can know 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.450
 already more allies towards the dead end so 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:49.000
 there I have just made a smash 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.680
 like dream 54 that had already also 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.890
 analyze in frac but except that he 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:55.209
 everything will unfold not everything is really going 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:56.319
 not behave well for him but this 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:57.910
 is there and it's really a beautiful 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:01.359
 part but after until the day he has 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:04.450
 crossed the t25 2 and then making it 

00:03:01.359 --> 00:03:06.310
 the t25 of the eu to fart at papeete in 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:07.630
 do well there missions that you 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:10.060
 have you changed much less quickly 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:13.930
 so reflex and wanted to fix 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:16.780
 charging at normal speed but t 25 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:18.730
 dollar farting the show so on pause there 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.010
 is expensive and little more and departure and 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:22.480
 so they are still looking twice 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:25.180
 slower and the terrain you have already finished 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:25.959
 long enough arms to recharge there it's 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:27.849
 much longer 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:30.069
 I do not know you but how many are you 

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:31.480
 time for example I just avoided 

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:32.889
 3 for those who ask him why 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:34.299
 I said elias 3 it's simply 

00:03:32.889 --> 00:03:37.200
 that I know I do not compete with 

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:40.300
 daniel roy and then also to realize 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:42.040
 this fragment site and especially tower 

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:43.630
 you'll see I'm going to actually do the 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:45.130
 turn this area back into 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:46.870
 self that this game can not do the face 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:48.160
 to face with an air are so in fact 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:50.320
 I try to lose the least visible 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:52.510
 possible in this part also of 

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:56.350
 do it again to win 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:58.570
 symbolic so of course we're going 

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:00.400
 win if it was almost safe like you 

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:02.680
 could have imagined one otherwise I think that 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:05.440
 I do not think I would have released this 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:06.820
 video especially that the beginning I wanted 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:09.370
 not the woman after I'm me it's 

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:10.840
 still my record of kid in watts and 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:13.030
 visit way very beautiful part 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:15.490
 and then also saw that I wanted to talk 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:17.530
 of the chain 2m 54 seen leaving the party 

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:18.730
 jcd an opportunity so there I was in 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:20.109
 train of caen you saw that I was 

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:21.130
 back behind a hedge siii good 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:22.900
 I did, in fact, actually 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:25.350
 finally from face to face but when 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:29.080
 you can see that takkal holloway so 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:31.000
 I was behind so judged on it 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:33.250
 we they did not arrive the painter is 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.320
 so just a site on next I do not know 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:37.330
 not good after people will say that they 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:39.820
 did not have a very good bike that was 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:40.870
 walk in the footsteps of the people of the 

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:42.460
 part are going to say they did not have a 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:44.680
 great job so here I come from 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:46.990
 finish the story even if he stayed 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:49.060
 that 31 10 shot at him on seeing that I 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:51.520
 a little bit more right now because 8 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:54.040
 millions of Argentineans it does not bother that 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:55.750
 would be one or two pages of cus so there 

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:58.260
 I noticed that they had second 

00:04:55.750 --> 00:05:00.430
 were 21 jarrell penetrate the cafes a 

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:02.230
 supermarket I told myself you kill me 

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:02.710
 the supermarket because he can do 

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:03.440
 very bad 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:07.490
 I 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:09.740
 everything is safe now it hurts but 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:11.450
 if the judgment is here he has more life 

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:14.000
 bounces a lot that's why I have 

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:15.260
 do I go the other first but 

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.940
 as you see I still had some 

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:20.330
 bad to kill the task that has super of 

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:24.170
 language but see also no hikari come 

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:27.290
 fishing but I really kill myself 

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:28.640
 disturbed so otherwise there are two 

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:31.340
 accounts of so the party starts a 

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:33.140
 little more to tighten so that remains a 

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:35.870
 tiger is a charge hunter I do not 

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:38.510
 do not know his name so it got complicated 

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:40.190
 of course we will both tackle 

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:42.050
 to the taggers ben me I'm not 

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:43.910
 really attack more this dc game i 

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:46.850
 could not see him so 

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:49.610
 here is the shark hunter coming in and there 

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:52.880
 I saw that my ally had eaten it 

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:56.000
 remained Monday that the tiger the a720 22nd 

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:58.460
 I have and I decided to kill yes I know 

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:02.570
 maybe it was keenan was not doing 

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:04.670
 too much but me good it does not me 

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:07.250
 not bothering if there now there is 

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:09.919
 the tank destroyer bank with a 

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:11.990
 other with the world has denied so he stays 

00:06:09.919 --> 00:06:12.620
 a little less than 110 actually we will play 

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:14.510
 with 

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:16.790
 we see the cause both 

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:18.350
 there I saw that he aims is my ally 

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:20.690
 so I say men's ball 

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:22.880
 the wolf is good I think he shot at 

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:24.830
 side where this time it was him who came 

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:27.350
 of sweat has cost 105 of the ranger what plays 

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:28.940
 bad is where to head I noticed 

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:30.230
 went to me so I was doing 

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:32.870
 watch the killer's logo on a ball 

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:34.850
 so I'm insuring myself meeting 

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:36.200
 here is this video was quite short which 

00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:38.390
 was my body to click it was eight 

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:39.770
 there is that so I hope this 

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:41.750
 gameplay you will have more because well 

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:43.970
 sure it's so kiel record and 

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:45.200
 if not the details of the battle this 

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:47.930
 subject i wanted to say bah I had 

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:49.610
 entries about 3000 of d g 8 that like 

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:51.770
 you did well when you got 

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:54.650
 saw I made about 20,000 profits 

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:56.900
 I think I made 30 35 miles of 

00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:59.020
 credit so here is the proof also that 

00:06:56.900 --> 00:07:03.770
 I had almost 8 million credits 

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:05.150
 but also I will show you how much 

00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:07.340
 I will miss him to have my next 

00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:08.630
 charvet it's the patton and ben he shows 

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:11.630
 nearly 

00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:13.760
 they have me a lot of subjects 175000 to 

00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:16.430
 do and I'm at 99 that's why 

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:17.840
 that the patton in my opinion for yet 

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:19.700
 wait a little longer especially do not 

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:21.140
 do not play really low do not play 

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:23.180
 a lot with the china father because 

00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:24.950
 I can not anyway to play with 

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:26.450
 here I am, you have just seen him 

00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:29.450
 which was not often like that is 

00:07:26.450 --> 00:07:31.520
 the more I get slaughtered that's why
