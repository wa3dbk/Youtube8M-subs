00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
three hits in a row yeah took me a

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.130 
three hits in a row yeah took me a
little<00:01:33.690> while<00:01:33.810> to<00:01:33.960> get<00:01:34.200> there<00:01:34.410> but<00:01:35.330> yeah<00:01:36.330> it's

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
little while to get there but yeah it's

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.680 
little while to get there but yeah it's
pretty<00:01:37.320> cool<00:01:37.560> let's<00:01:37.830> go<00:01:38.100> and<00:01:38.460> invade<00:01:39.210> their

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:39.690 
pretty cool let's go and invade their

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:41.750 
pretty cool let's go and invade their
base<00:01:39.960> because<00:01:40.560> there's<00:01:41.040> not<00:01:41.280> too<00:01:41.460> many<00:01:41.520> people

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:45.200 
so I think we can do it we can do it

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:50.060 
so I think we can do it we can do it
