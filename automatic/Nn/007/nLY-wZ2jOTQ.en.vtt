shouldn't feel just pull the nice and
snug<00:02:09.910> now<00:02:11.849> what<00:02:12.849> I<00:02:12.880> found<00:02:13.360> is<00:02:13.840> I<00:02:14.140> would<00:02:14.349> stitch

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709 
snug now what I found is I would stitch

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:18.839 
snug now what I found is I would stitch
and<00:02:15.310> it<00:02:16.150> wouldn't<00:02:16.480> look<00:02:16.599> really<00:02:16.959> tight<00:02:17.670> so<00:02:18.670> if

00:02:18.839 --> 00:02:18.849 
and it wouldn't look really tight so if

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:20.309 
and it wouldn't look really tight so if
it<00:02:18.940> doesn't<00:02:19.120> look<00:02:19.360> tight<00:02:19.630> enough<00:02:19.870> for<00:02:20.140> you<00:02:20.290> I

00:02:20.309 --> 00:02:20.319 
it doesn't look tight enough for you I

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:23.070 
it doesn't look tight enough for you I
just<00:02:20.620> go<00:02:20.920> back<00:02:21.130> and<00:02:21.549> I<00:02:21.700> pick<00:02:22.000> just<00:02:22.810> like<00:02:22.930> you're

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
just go back and I pick just like you're

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.229 
just go back and I pick just like you're
tightening<00:02:23.319> up<00:02:23.620> shoelaces<00:02:24.040> so<00:02:24.250> I<00:02:24.459> would<00:02:24.640> pull

00:02:25.229 --> 00:02:25.239 
tightening up shoelaces so I would pull

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:27.750 
tightening up shoelaces so I would pull
the<00:02:25.450> slack<00:02:25.690> out<00:02:25.900> of<00:02:25.959> this<00:02:26.200> one<00:02:26.470> and<00:02:26.860> then<00:02:27.730> I

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
the slack out of this one and then I

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.180 
the slack out of this one and then I
would<00:02:28.030> go<00:02:28.150> across<00:02:28.480> do<00:02:29.290> this<00:02:29.560> one<00:02:29.799> see<00:02:30.070> it's

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
would go across do this one see it's

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:33.000 
would go across do this one see it's
getting<00:02:30.459> nice<00:02:30.579> and<00:02:30.609> tight<00:02:31.410> and<00:02:32.410> just<00:02:32.709> go<00:02:32.829> back

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
getting nice and tight and just go back

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:37.400 
getting nice and tight and just go back
and<00:02:33.220> forth

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:39.960 

okay<00:02:38.410> so<00:02:38.470> let's<00:02:38.799> pretend<00:02:39.010> that<00:02:39.489> we<00:02:39.700> stitched

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
okay so let's pretend that we stitched

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.300 
okay so let's pretend that we stitched
all<00:02:40.239> the<00:02:40.299> way<00:02:40.450> around<00:02:40.540> and<00:02:41.140> now<00:02:41.920> we<00:02:41.980> want<00:02:42.220> to

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
all the way around and now we want to

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.160 
all the way around and now we want to
end<00:02:42.489> it<00:02:42.700> this<00:02:42.970> is<00:02:43.209> what<00:02:43.359> I<00:02:43.390> did<00:02:43.720> I<00:02:43.870> don't<00:02:43.930> know

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
end it this is what I did I don't know

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:47.400 
end it this is what I did I don't know
how<00:02:44.319> you<00:02:44.380> end<00:02:44.709> yours<00:02:45.060> but<00:02:46.060> it<00:02:46.180> just<00:02:46.420> it<00:02:47.200> gives

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.410 
how you end yours but it just it gives

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:50.940 
how you end yours but it just it gives
it<00:02:47.560> a<00:02:47.650> nice<00:02:48.150> clean<00:02:49.150> end<00:02:49.600> so<00:02:50.200> I<00:02:50.260> go<00:02:50.500> through<00:02:50.769> and

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
it a nice clean end so I go through and

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:53.340 
it a nice clean end so I go through and
I<00:02:51.010> have<00:02:51.130> a<00:02:51.160> loop<00:02:51.400> you<00:02:51.579> see<00:02:51.760> my<00:02:51.880> loop<00:02:52.200> put<00:02:53.200> my
