00:01:37.989 --> 00:01:43.569

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:01.979
 little double one quiet ca ca kills 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:05.590

 I'm going to have a good game then on this 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:09.580
 game little advice you have to take the 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:12.280
 time to adjust always take the 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:14.470
 time because otherwise if you go 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.090
 miss you missed and that's it and suddenly 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:19.250
 it's not cool so here I 'm going to be 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:21.990
 kill by his hood kuyt autumnal fing 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:24.060

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.170
 13/01 I will finish with a I will you 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:31.280
 spoiler the score i will finish with a 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:34.590
 19 2 19 of which is pretty good 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:38.370
 I following this thing I made a 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:39.959
 little gameplay am on the same map with 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:41.280
 always the same people but that I 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:44.370
 do not put as a result of the video because 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:47.550
 that I do not have peno now time to 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.870
 make this comment so but the other 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:50.310
 part is pretty good I think I'll 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.739
 give it to elite for it to do its 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:54.450
 presentation where I'm doing a 25-5 I believe 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:57.000
 that I believe with a small double 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.739
 my first collateral on modane combat 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.690
 4 she went cream 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:02.220
 normally it is against them 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:04.200
 were break this weird because there is 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:06.630
 a guy it's because there's a guy who 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:09.750
 did a quine at the same time but 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:10.430
 so here is my little collateral game the 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:13.049
 beloved 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:14.940
 there I will go around slightly I'm doing 

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:16.620
 to believe that I am where I turn we go 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:18.239
 comment on the gameplay as a real boss 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:20.819
 as true boss of the commander tahri 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:22.500
 so that's pretty good yes I'm getting killed 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:23.280
 second time I die there I do not know 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.440
 not how he got me 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:28.680
 he must surely me one shot and level one 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:31.170
 can sign level 1 the normal guy then 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:34.079
 injury fall I was lucky I 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:36.600
 spawn as a hub there I lay up and the 

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:41.160
