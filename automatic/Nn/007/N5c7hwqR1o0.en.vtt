insole and again it's the zero drop so

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:18.149 
insole and again it's the zero drop so

actually<00:05:01.600> took<00:05:01.990> me<00:05:02.200> a<00:05:02.230> moment<00:05:02.530> couple<00:05:03.100> of

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:03.160 
actually took me a moment couple of

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:04.790 
actually took me a moment couple of
minutes<00:05:03.460> to<00:05:03.670> sit<00:05:03.940> there<00:05:04.030> and<00:05:04.180> loosen<00:05:04.540> them<00:05:04.660> up

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:04.800 
minutes to sit there and loosen them up

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:09.600 
minutes to sit there and loosen them up
so<00:05:05.800> I<00:05:06.930> don't<00:05:07.930> think<00:05:08.140> they're<00:05:08.290> going<00:05:08.470> to<00:05:08.650> get

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:09.610 
so I don't think they're going to get

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:12.450 
so I don't think they're going to get
undone<00:05:10.210> or<00:05:10.810> end<00:05:11.350> up<00:05:11.530> like<00:05:11.920> at<00:05:12.070> the<00:05:12.160> end<00:05:12.190> of<00:05:12.370> the

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:12.460 
undone or end up like at the end of the

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:14.460 
undone or end up like at the end of the
day<00:05:12.610> it's<00:05:12.940> too<00:05:13.450> loose<00:05:13.630> down<00:05:13.900> here<00:05:13.960> and<00:05:14.350> too

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:14.470 
day it's too loose down here and too

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:16.890 
day it's too loose down here and too
tight<00:05:14.740> up<00:05:14.890> here<00:05:14.940> these<00:05:15.940> are<00:05:16.150> staying<00:05:16.570> in<00:05:16.720> place

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:16.900 
tight up here these are staying in place

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:19.410

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:22.540 
in a little bit but I think this is the

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:25.650 
in a little bit but I think this is the
shoe<00:05:22.750> for<00:05:23.020> me<00:05:23.140> again<00:05:23.520> zero<00:05:24.520> drop<00:05:24.910> is<00:05:25.150> the<00:05:25.540> way

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:25.660 
shoe for me again zero drop is the way

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:27.720 
shoe for me again zero drop is the way
the<00:05:26.230> thing<00:05:26.440> that's<00:05:26.620> been<00:05:26.770> working<00:05:27.010> for<00:05:27.460> me<00:05:27.580> the

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:27.730 
the thing that's been working for me the

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:30.750 
the thing that's been working for me the
best<00:05:28.890> traditionally<00:05:29.890> a<00:05:30.130> lot<00:05:30.400> of<00:05:30.520> shoes

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:30.760 
best traditionally a lot of shoes

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:33.120 
best traditionally a lot of shoes
they'll<00:05:31.030> have<00:05:31.210> like<00:05:31.330> a<00:05:31.390> heel<00:05:31.750> height<00:05:31.960> and<00:05:32.200> then

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:33.130 
they'll have like a heel height and then

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:35.940 
they'll have like a heel height and then
it<00:05:33.400> gets<00:05:33.520> smaller<00:05:33.910> down<00:05:34.210> here<00:05:34.600> now<00:05:35.380> since<00:05:35.440> I

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:35.950 
it gets smaller down here now since I

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:38.400 
it gets smaller down here now since I
under<00:05:36.340> pronate<00:05:36.820> what<00:05:37.120> would<00:05:37.270> happen<00:05:37.690> is<00:05:37.930> i

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:38.410 
under pronate what would happen is i

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:41.900 
under pronate what would happen is i
would<00:05:38.560> just<00:05:39.120> accidentally<00:05:40.120> put<00:05:40.390> so<00:05:40.690> much<00:05:40.990> of

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:41.910 
would just accidentally put so much of

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:46.350 
would just accidentally put so much of
my<00:05:43.230> foot<00:05:44.230> right<00:05:44.890> here<00:05:44.950> and<00:05:45.400> here<00:05:45.790> that<00:05:46.240> all

my foot right here and here that all
that<00:05:46.540> heel<00:05:46.780> height<00:05:47.020> would<00:05:47.590> actually<00:05:47.950> tend<00:05:48.190> to

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:48.340 
that heel height would actually tend to

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:50.420 
that heel height would actually tend to
make<00:05:48.430> me<00:05:48.610> roll<00:05:48.850> my<00:05:48.880> ankle<00:05:49.390> even<00:05:49.690> more<00:05:49.990> and
