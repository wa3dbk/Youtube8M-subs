into the frame focal length measured in

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.300 
into the frame focal length measured in
millimeter<00:00:39.420> is<00:00:39.720> the<00:00:40.200> distance<00:00:40.680> for<00:00:40.950> the<00:00:40.980> light

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:41.310 
millimeter is the distance for the light

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:43.820 
millimeter is the distance for the light
to<00:00:41.640> travel<00:00:41.820> from<00:00:42.090> the<00:00:42.480> center<00:00:43.080> of<00:00:43.200> the<00:00:43.350> lens<00:00:43.530> to

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:43.830 
to travel from the center of the lens to

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:46.340 
to travel from the center of the lens to
where<00:00:44.220> the<00:00:44.370> images<00:00:44.730> form<00:00:45.000> in<00:00:45.210> the<00:00:45.300> camera<00:00:45.660> see

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
where the images form in the camera see

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.200 
where the images form in the camera see
how<00:00:46.590> lower<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:47.070> focal<00:00:47.430> length<00:00:47.460> therefore

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
how lower the focal length therefore

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.840 
how lower the focal length therefore
wider<00:00:48.690> angle<00:00:49.080> of<00:00:49.170> view<00:00:49.470> allows<00:00:50.070> more<00:00:50.430> to<00:00:50.670> fit

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
wider angle of view allows more to fit
