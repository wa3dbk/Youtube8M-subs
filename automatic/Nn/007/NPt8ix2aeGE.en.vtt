00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:07.940
 also a 

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:36.270
 a water board is responsible for cleaning waste water 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.240
 the dirty water of houses and 

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:44.150
 becomes the main sewage treatment plant through the so-called waste 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:46.320
 sown 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.840
 then the clean water can be returned to the plant and animal without endangering human health 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.840
 the Nazis are 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:22.390
 to restructure the complainants here in the Netherlands 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:24.210
 like dunes 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.670
 the sea dikes 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:27.790
 with that of the band 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:31.310
 these vibrations total more than 35 100 kilometers 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:35.010
 he made sure that everyone can be safe 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:38.010
 and sleep 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.170
 a weapon and demanded the necessary poll from dikes and dunes 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:11.100
 other companies with are, for example, the burden on existing buildings 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:12.729
 on the dyke 

00:02:12.729 --> 00:02:15.699
 and muskrats digging tunnels in dikes 

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:18.929
 These threats can create dangerous situations for the cause 

00:02:19.839 --> 00:02:21.239
 like overflowing 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:23.799
 the water was over the dike 

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:24.889
 in the meantime 

00:02:24.889 --> 00:02:26.029
 involving water 

00:02:26.029 --> 00:02:28.429
 recent research has its people 

00:02:28.429 --> 00:02:30.479
 residents who love the dyke covering 

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:33.039
 or subsidence of the church 

00:02:33.039 --> 00:02:37.019
 therefore the water board controls with traditional techniques and modern ones 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:38.439
 techniques 

00:02:38.439 --> 00:02:41.439
 repair work needed last year 

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:43.650
 az 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.650
 the 

00:02:59.139 --> 00:03:02.139
 8 

00:03:05.439 --> 00:03:07.569
 so attention 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:10.509
 so 

00:03:10.509 --> 00:03:13.349
 by means of ground and weirs 

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:16.279
 to keep the groundwater up to standard 

00:03:16.279 --> 00:03:19.279
 thanks to them too much water for example norway 

00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:21.799
 lowered for the driver 

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:23.419
 excess water is made 

00:03:23.419 --> 00:03:26.419
 ditches were removed but it was also disappointing 

00:03:27.039 --> 00:03:29.899
 both were allowed to be controlled by higher 

00:03:29.899 --> 00:03:32.899
 that the water cannot flow away 

00:03:33.809 --> 00:03:35.300
 brett the pumping station 

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:36.609
 the large pumps 

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:39.899
 it can water was sold over a while 

00:03:39.899 --> 00:03:41.619
 8 

00:03:41.619 --> 00:03:44.619
 the three most important tasks of the water boards 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:48.099
 we provide clean water 

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:49.929
 safe water 

00:03:49.929 --> 00:03:52.389
 and sufficient 

00:03:52.389 --> 00:03:54.089
 and in the future 

00:03:54.089 --> 00:03:57.929
 That means that the water boards take changes into account 

00:03:57.929 --> 00:03:59.089
 the climate 

00:03:59.089 --> 00:04:03.579
 global warming causes wetter winters shameless deliverymen 

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:08.999
 Water retention and re-change are new ways of water 

00:04:10.499 --> 00:04:13.519
 brooks and rivers that have been dug up 

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:15.829
 furthermore worry 

00:04:15.829 --> 00:04:20.199
 as a result, the water flows more slowly and more water can become in the mountains 

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:22.019
 captured 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:26.699
 together with municipalities and blood tests the water board grounds that temporarily 

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:28.659
 can be lowered 

00:04:28.659 --> 00:04:31.050
 so keep the people in the houses away 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:32.520
 willebroek 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:37.590
 in urban areas, water is given more space in the form of 5,000 power 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:43.500
 there is also the possibility to disconnect rainwater drainage from the 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:44.749
 sewerage 

00:04:44.749 --> 00:04:47.520
 rainwater falls on roofs and streets 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:50.860
 is disposed of separately and the so-called weapons collection point 

00:04:51.659 --> 00:04:55.949
 there the clean water drops air and the bottom we focus let go without 

00:04:55.949 --> 00:04:59.029
 sent a bill 

00:04:59.029 --> 00:05:03.469
 These examples are a diamond in new insights when it comes to dealing 

00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:04.740
 with water 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:08.570
 also no longer fight against reading policy together in moderation 

00:05:09.129 --> 00:05:11.530
 the water boards of the netherlands help with this
