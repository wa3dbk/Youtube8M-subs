 new portable hp convertibles that 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.710
 comes to the Spanish market with a novelty 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.390
 design and features that allow 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.029
 to the professionals to get the most 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.310
 benefit of mobility with screen

 13-inch touchscreen a thickness of 15 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.340
 millimeters and less than a kilo and a half of 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.400
 weight 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.230
 the hp specter x 360 offers up to 12 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:36.870
 hours of autonomy and great performance 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:40.410
 thanks to its intel core i5 processors 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:43.140
 and i7 of fifth generation up to 512 gb 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.940
 solid- state and large hard disk 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.340
 connectivity possibilities to 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:50.489
 Incorporate compatible HDMI ports and 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:53.940
 displayport 1.2 and up to 3 usb ports 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:57.660
 3.0 on power issues is a laptop 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:01:00.210
 high-end with core i5 i7 processors 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.070
 in which we sacrifice ourselves 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.710
 power even though as you can see 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:09.890
 the lightness and thinness of the laptop 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.890
 with solid state disks up to 512 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:15.030
 with a much improved wifi is a design 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.530
 also new from hp in which we improve 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.750
 the antenna slot that is in the 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.130
 top of the screen and on topics 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.470
 of the subtlety as you can see at the end 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.150
 is a traditional computer is a 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.190
 computer that you can use in mode 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.980
 support in support mode to see 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:31.890
 movies as a store to be able to play 

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:33.510
 even in tablet mode at the end because 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.790
 You can use it like any tablet in the 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:37.200
 day by day carrying cloth and what's important 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.690
 is that in the end both in tablet mode 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.810
 as in portable mode the thickness does not 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:45.660
 increases and rotates completely in parallel 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:48.000
 one sheet with the other and it has the same 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:49.830
 profile all these features 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.020
 they also involve a series of 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:54.630
 possibilities for professionals who 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.340
 find in the x 360 spectrum a 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.350
 versatile device with large 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.550
 possibilities 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:01.290
 The first is true that in the world 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:04.320
 professional there is a trend 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:07.200
 of convergence between taste and use 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:09.420
 of consumption as a consumer and as 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.580
 professional we have seen phones 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.800
 not the phone or the professional does not have 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.270
 to be even uglier or greater than the 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.290
 consumer phone the same is 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.489
 happening in the 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.860
 laptops and devices 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:21.329
 mobile knowing the convergence is going 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.730
 I think what he's going to call him the most 

00:02:21.329 --> 00:02:26.310
 attention to a user first if not 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:28.260
 is going to doubt is its design and its format a 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:33.450
 weight a professional who wants to give 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:35.129
 image of innovative image of cool 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.720
 Well, you need a product that is cool and 

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:38.280
 this this laptop 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.379
 I believe that it fulfills that expectation and 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:43.409
 second a professional can not 

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:46.439
 dispense with the functionalities the 

00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:47.459
 security returns everything that 

00:02:46.439 --> 00:02:49.889
 you need a good professional laptop 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:52.069
 and this probable also fulfills it and 

00:02:49.889 --> 00:02:54.810
 we have added a third straight the 360 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:56.819
 when a professional uses the 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:59.609
 Traveling mobility has to consume 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:01.980
 contained the finished 360 is spectacular 

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:03.299
 because until now we even saw 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:05.310
 possibilities that were going to be deported to 

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:07.680
 work and the tablet to watch a video 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:10.560
 on the plane today for example a 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:13.709
 video to consume a magazine 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:16.829
 digital today the 360 ​​allows 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:18.940
 consume technology or consume 

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:24.220
 information as a tablet 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:25.930
 create information like a powerful fish a 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:27.790
 innovative hinged system and a 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:30.700
 polished metal finish with a cut 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:32.080
 only make the x 360 spectrum a 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:33.760
 authentic jewel 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:36.160
 not in vain the fashion designer Juan 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:39.160
 duyos has designed two jewelry series 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:41.470
 who share materials silver onyx gold 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:42.750
 pink and amber inspired by this 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:45.070
 new convertible 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:47.290
 well I'm a restless guy and in the end 

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:48.190
 all these types of challenges give me 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:49.990
 vidilla 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:51.430
 imagine of a computer that for me 

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:52.930
 makes life easier and that seemed 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:54.100
 incredible when they introduced me that I 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:56.440
 I have to make a jewelry line 

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:58.780
 they talked about a gem computer with 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:00.940
 which was very easy the connection the 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:02.590
 speed and that thing like convertibles that 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:05.410
 it seemed fascinating to me 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:08.740
 that was going to work and so we want that 

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:11.110
 it's going to figure, I'm pretty basic for 

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:12.460
 these things and I had already done the 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:14.250
 travel that we all have with a 

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:17.350
 portable and with even with a tablet 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:18.700
 I think this history of convertibles and 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:21.220
 what is above as different 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:23.340
 positions to make it easy for you and about 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:25.680
 everything that makes things easier 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:29.130
 for me it has been a kind of 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:32.250
 disclosure or be able to use the 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:36.120
 keyboard touch the screen do it from 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:38.160
 suddenly tablet but be to me the zones 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:42.199
 practices ask me and this has been like 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:42.199
 that I tell you a one discovery
