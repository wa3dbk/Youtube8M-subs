 stolberg cook schäuble march and mayer 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:14.089
 These people are definitely in theirs 

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:16.109
 national phase occurred 

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:19.080
 what matters is just something out the back 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:21.510
 Must be literally if the 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.560
 The traditional defamation loses the 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.080
 german population 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.519
 The man is right again 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.960
 German must be considered 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.170
 collective virtual root table 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:34.880
 imagine where humans a brains brain 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:37.140
 The German has a Stammtisch 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:38.969
 and how do you want a Muslim of 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.290
 no pork knuckles kabir drinks 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.670
 How do you want German? 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.059
 Stammtisch integrating that works 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.059
 Not 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:47.750
 So you can be so stupid German 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:51.590
 you have to be born 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:51.590
 that's a blood pool 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:57.180
 German it was a blood thing I go 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:01:00.780
 further I say German is a kind 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:03.450
 genetic defect I have it myself 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:07.040
 is not wanting 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:07.040
 so not yourself 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:15.490
 they overwhelm the german double pass 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:17.780
 there thinks the German extra level 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:19.010
 what does the candidate stand for 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:22.340
 brain pacemaker under one 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:24.410
 double pass before you stand twice 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.820
 again but what the Germans have 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:27.590
 never even double names 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.840
 what can you accept this 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:33.230
 Explain people can be translated into cultural 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.880
 diversity living side by side without his 

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:38.090
 to lose identity 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:41.540
 these people live in a fall without 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:43.280
 to have an identity and that is that 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:44.480
 real problem of integration that 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.480
 create all of it, all 

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:49.460
 be integrated only while what is the 

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:50.570
 the german identity of this here in 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:53.210
 they have to stop danger 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:55.400
 Roland Cook says the Germans have 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:56.350
 fear their national identity too 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.370
 to lose 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:01.690
 Sorry I live with too 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:01.690
 Roland Cook in a country 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:14.959
 What should that be the German identity 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:18.140
 every frenchman owns a card the dt 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:21.140
 what do you have your ID card 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:25.390
 or you have a document that shows 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:25.390
 that it belongs to the staff of the brd 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:35.469
 what is that german identity if 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.900
 as turk after 20 years in bavaria 

00:02:35.469 --> 00:02:39.700
 finally they can yodel the 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.010
 schuhplattler pull everything on it's job 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.969
 not to mecklenburg western pomerania around 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:45.879
 first make a stronger one in 

00:02:42.969 --> 00:02:47.650
 gossip or what is that 

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:50.109
 from region to region but belong to 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:52.090
 read country or what is the German 

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:53.739
 identity it is the crash leather 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:56.170
 bavarian beer stein the die 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:59.080
 backwoodsman the monosyllabic yet 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:02.910
 German team comes into the obligation 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:02.910
 or the people bottled with kölsch 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:16.280
 or is it in the end still 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.629
 düsseldorfer vernissage gänger of everything 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:20.290
 what he can not explain himself for 

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:20.290
 art stops 

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:35.079
 for example, those filled with kölsch 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:35.079
 people want 

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:40.510
 and you want people to participate 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:42.190
 from centuries-old culture around with 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:43.840
 intact family structures to us 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:45.420
 come seriously expect that up 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:47.860
 go to this level here 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:49.330
 as a last argument, if the language is the 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:51.490
 we have to do this german we can 

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:55.300
 must at least decent German what 

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:57.010
 is now decent where 

00:03:55.300 --> 00:04:03.490
 That's what they were talking about 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:04.990
 Sometimes the Germans can do it yourself 

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:06.360
 at a Swabian Stammtisch 

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:08.650
 articulate 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:11.910
 Most cows could be in the 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:11.910
 no longer ask Eifel about it 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:27.000
 German are all only when they as 

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:28.380
 foreigners have the German passport or 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.210
 do the language test of 

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:30.950
 diversity comes from where 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:33.630
 they do 

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:35.070
 wilke the immigration office spot it 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:37.020
 there are cities in germany then have to 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:39.150
 She spoke while proving that she 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:40.560
 in German can explain what is the 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:44.190
 difference between majority and 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:45.690
 proportional voting rights are likely to be 

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:48.680
 Most of them are pretty happy 

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:48.680
 that they are already German 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:03.340
 the harmless variant spoke that is the 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:04.930
 minimum requirement so to speak that is 

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:06.640
 following you must have a german 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:07.960
 Newspaper article not so a four counter 

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:09.940
 from the picture newspaper to the right one 

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:11.740
 newspaper article municipal politics so 

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:14.260
 The stuff that they have to break up 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:16.360
 reading German can understand 

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:19.120
 and then the contents with own words 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:21.250
 can play in german if you 

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:25.060
 to do the test with all Germans 

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:28.020
 you can choose half of citizens 

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:28.020
 seductive thought 

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:43.200
 only which country should 40 million 

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:45.210
 record intelligence refugees 

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:47.330
 so big container can no longer rtl 

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:49.560

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:50.400
 what do the Stammtisch brothers have for 

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:51.840
 problems with turkey 

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:54.030

 be integrated around peaceful city 

00:07:12.569 --> 00:07:16.110

00:07:54.569 --> 00:07:58.169
 That is why the Turks are to be integrated 

00:07:56.759 --> 00:08:00.680
 Why should be have better 

00:07:58.169 --> 00:08:00.680
