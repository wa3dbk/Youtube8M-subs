00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.140
 has been talking 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:12.330
 this video is more than a tutorial it is a 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:16.440
 manifestation of love love for my husband 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:18.590
 my king my prince blue and love for the 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.200
 makeup 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:23.540
 every person has his dreams some 

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:27.140
 people dream of fortune some 

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:30.020
 they live by fame power I dreamed 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:32.140
 with finding my love my story of 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:32.140
 fairies 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:42.960
 there was once a boy and a girl who 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:46.260
 I dreamed of love and on a night of 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.629
 full moon both at the same time watched 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.350
 to heaven and they asked that their wish be 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.350
 make reality 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:03.690
 they were in love you could tell by the 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:06.090
 way they looked at each other as if 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:09.110
 they had the most wonderful secret of 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.110
 world among them 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.860
 this is my wedding makeup 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.990
 I hope you like it, welcome to my channel 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:26.450
 Your wedding makeup should be 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:28.579
 done so that in 20 years what 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.740
 see and do not say what I was thinking 

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:33.439
 avoided making fashionable trends 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:36.110
 because fashions go bet on what 

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:38.299
 classic and simple but elegant and about 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:41.569
 first of all, I have a place 

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:43.909
 with a lot of natural light illuminates very well 

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:46.310
 your face but avoid the whole thing very strong 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:49.009
 bright looks for the balance nor very 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:50.799
 bright or very badly use makeup to 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:54.140
 water proof this is very important 

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:56.959
 you can also apply breimer and one 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:59.950
 base of a proofreader that covers and last 

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:59.950
 all day 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:05.600
 always make sure to blend very well 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:09.070
 everything and use a shadow color of 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:09.070
 transition as base 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:19.240
 I believe that at this moment a tone 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:22.200
 orange to give a warm touch to the 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:22.200
 light of the eyes 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.800
 it's up to men to mostly shades 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:37.319
 neutral and then place a bright tone 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:41.000
 on the mobile eyelid to give light to the 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:41.000
 look and illuminate your eyes 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:55.349
 do not forget the illuminator is super 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.349
 important 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:10.910
 give more depth the brown tone and 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:14.770
 then delineate the eye below 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:14.770
 very subtle way the subtle 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:39.580
 delineate your eyes with a brown tone and 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:42.510
 avoid using a lot of black 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:42.510
 two 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:05.790
 Y 

00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:23.790
 Y 

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:26.610
 m 

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:28.830
 do not forget your eyebrows, they give you strength 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:32.180
 look and they are as important as 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:32.180
 any other part of your face 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:43.909
 but 

00:04:41.689 --> 00:04:47.059
 Give depth to your face with a good 

00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:49.479
 outlined this will help highlight the 

00:04:47.059 --> 00:04:49.479
 attributes 

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:55.440
 Y 

00:05:15.289 --> 00:05:18.979
 remember that in Hungarian you should have 

00:05:17.119 --> 00:05:22.249
 enough color to compensate for 

00:05:18.979 --> 00:05:24.540
 white of the dress and not look pale 

00:05:22.249 --> 00:05:27.060
 that puts your blush 

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:29.450
 and also do not forget to use a color of 

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:33.030
 lips that I love and if it's a bright tone 

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:35.550
 very much better you did not change the tones 

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:38.460
 Nude can make you look calligraphic 

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:42.200
 rescue with a red tone or something a lot 

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:42.200
 brighter if you are daring 

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:14.170
 hugo and the pro will to this sacrament 

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:17.260
 and the name of the god of the church 

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:20.200
 declared husband and wife in the name of 

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:22.590
 father and the son and the holy spirit 

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:22.590
 Amen 

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:45.920
 ah
