weaknesses up first i want to mention

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.799 
weaknesses up first i want to mention
that<00:00:44.309> very<00:00:44.520> simply<00:00:44.820> each<00:00:45.120> receiver<00:00:45.570> has

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
that very simply each receiver has

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.990 
that very simply each receiver has
somebody<00:00:46.140> around<00:00:46.620> him<00:00:46.920> this<00:00:47.460> is<00:00:47.579> opposed<00:00:47.879> to

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
somebody around him this is opposed to

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.819 
somebody around him this is opposed to
zone<00:00:48.030> defense<00:00:48.600> which<00:00:48.750> can<00:00:48.989> be<00:00:49.079> manipulated<00:00:49.710> by

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
zone defense which can be manipulated by

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.529 
zone defense which can be manipulated by
having<00:00:50.160> more<00:00:50.340> receivers<00:00:50.670> in<00:00:50.940> an<00:00:51.030> area<00:00:51.210> than

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
having more receivers in an area than

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.779

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
there are defenders in man defense you

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:54.860 
there are defenders in man defense you
don't<00:00:53.940> have<00:00:54.059> to<00:00:54.180> worry<00:00:54.329> if<00:00:54.449> somebody<00:00:54.750> who's

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
don't have to worry if somebody who's

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.229 
don't have to worry if somebody who's
wide<00:00:55.110> open<00:00:55.590> this<00:00:56.160> is<00:00:56.309> a<00:00:56.370> strength<00:00:56.640> and<00:00:56.879> can't

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239

this<00:01:09.210> is<00:01:09.360> for<00:01:09.570> our<00:01:09.600> opponent<00:01:10.020> if<00:01:10.110> we<00:01:10.229> actually

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
this is for our opponent if we actually

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.260 
this is for our opponent if we actually
do<00:01:10.860> send<00:01:11.189> a<00:01:11.280> blitz<00:01:11.490> and<00:01:11.670> we<00:01:11.909> press<00:01:12.119> his

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
receivers the fact that the icons are

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:15.620 
receivers the fact that the icons are
great<00:01:14.640> this<00:01:14.729> year<00:01:14.790> means<00:01:15.150> that<00:01:15.330> a<00:01:15.360> blitz

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
great this year means that a blitz

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.210 
great this year means that a blitz
coming<00:01:15.810> in<00:01:16.049> forces<00:01:16.380> of<00:01:16.470> all<00:01:16.590> out<00:01:16.740> early<00:01:17.009> and<00:01:17.100> if

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
bumped but even if he beats the press he

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.130 
bumped but even if he beats the press he
isn't<00:01:27.119> even<00:01:27.270> looking<00:01:27.360> for<00:01:27.630> the<00:01:27.689> ball<00:01:27.869> and

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
isn't even looking for the ball and

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.080 
isn't even looking for the ball and
we'll<00:01:28.799> get<00:01:28.890> in<00:01:28.979> a<00:01:29.070> little<00:01:29.280> bit<00:01:29.400> more<00:01:29.700> about<00:01:29.970> the

we'll get in a little bit more about the

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.460 
we'll get in a little bit more about the

but surely you could see the need for a

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.359 
but surely you could see the need for a
blitz<00:01:33.150> in<00:01:33.270> Madden<00:01:33.479> 13<00:01:33.560> now<00:01:34.560> i<00:01:34.590> use<00:01:34.710> the<00:01:35.009> bengals

power<00:01:47.070> in<00:01:47.310> my<00:01:47.430> opinion<00:01:47.700> he's<00:01:48.149> the<00:01:48.299> best<00:01:48.479> safety

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810

previous<00:01:52.770> tutorials<00:01:53.280> we<00:01:53.369> spoke<00:01:53.549> about<00:01:53.729> the

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
previous tutorials we spoke about the

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.490 
previous tutorials we spoke about the
need<00:01:53.909> for<00:01:54.240> speed<00:01:54.329> at<00:01:54.570> free<00:01:54.720> safety<00:01:54.930> because

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
need for speed at free safety because

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:56.539 
need for speed at free safety because
we're<00:01:55.649> going<00:01:55.770> to<00:01:55.829> be<00:01:55.920> using<00:01:56.189> his<00:01:56.399> position

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.190 
we're going to be using his position
manually<00:01:57.149> so<00:01:57.299> we<00:01:57.390> need<00:01:57.570> to<00:01:57.689> have<00:01:57.810> the<00:01:57.960> speed<00:01:58.170> to

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
manually so we need to have the speed to

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.230 
manually so we need to have the speed to
fly<00:01:58.439> around<00:01:58.530> amix<00:01:58.890> in<00:01:58.979> place<00:01:59.189> terence<00:02:00.149> newman
