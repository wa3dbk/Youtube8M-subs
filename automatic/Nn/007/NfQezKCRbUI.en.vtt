it's<00:01:27.110> one<00:01:27.229> of<00:01:27.320> the<00:01:27.380> easiest<00:01:27.710> one<00:01:28.040> I'm<00:01:28.190> going<00:01:28.310> to

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:28.369 
it's one of the easiest one I'm going to

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:30.580 
it's one of the easiest one I'm going to
use<00:01:28.490> a<00:01:28.520> mason<00:01:29.000> jar<00:01:29.030> with<00:01:29.390> a<00:01:29.450> container<00:01:29.869> and<00:01:30.259> we

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590 
use a mason jar with a container and we

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:32.560 
use a mason jar with a container and we
need<00:01:30.710> to<00:01:30.829> cut<00:01:31.009> the<00:01:31.130> roses<00:01:31.549> to<00:01:32.180> different

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:32.570 
need to cut the roses to different

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:35.410 
need to cut the roses to different
heights<00:01:32.810> the<00:01:33.530> perimeter<00:01:34.100> roses<00:01:34.609> need<00:01:35.030> to<00:01:35.210> be

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:35.420 
heights the perimeter roses need to be

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.859 
heights the perimeter roses need to be
just<00:01:36.140> about<00:01:36.320> an<00:01:36.500> inch<00:01:36.710> above<00:01:36.979> the<00:01:37.039> collar<00:01:37.810> so<00:01:38.810> I

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:38.869 
just about an inch above the collar so I

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:40.029 
just about an inch above the collar so I
cut<00:01:39.140> them<00:01:39.229> right<00:01:39.409> there<00:01:39.649> and<00:01:39.680> we're<00:01:39.890> going<00:01:40.009> to

00:01:40.029 --> 00:01:40.039 
cut them right there and we're going to

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:42.520 
cut them right there and we're going to
cut<00:01:40.250> eight<00:01:40.490> of<00:01:40.700> our<00:01:40.820> roses<00:01:41.359> so<00:01:42.289> now<00:01:42.409> we're

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.530 
cut eight of our roses so now we're

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:43.929 
cut eight of our roses so now we're
going<00:01:42.619> to<00:01:42.679> take<00:01:42.890> these<00:01:43.039> eight<00:01:43.280> roses<00:01:43.789> and

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:43.939 
going to take these eight roses and

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:45.279 
going to take these eight roses and
arrange<00:01:44.210> them<00:01:44.390> around<00:01:44.509> the<00:01:44.719> perimeter<00:01:44.869> of<00:01:45.170> the

00:01:45.279 --> 00:01:45.289 
arrange them around the perimeter of the

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:47.349 
arrange them around the perimeter of the
base<00:01:45.560> I<00:01:45.920> like<00:01:46.280> to<00:01:46.429> pull<00:01:46.609> the<00:01:46.640> leaves<00:01:46.969> off<00:01:47.179> the

00:01:47.349 --> 00:01:47.359 
base I like to pull the leaves off the

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:50.800 
base I like to pull the leaves off the
very<00:01:47.570> bottom<00:01:48.020> so<00:01:48.049> that<00:01:48.350> it<00:01:48.409> looks<00:01:48.590> clean<00:01:49.810> now

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810 
very bottom so that it looks clean now

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:51.999 
very bottom so that it looks clean now
we're<00:01:50.929> going<00:01:51.020> to<00:01:51.079> cut<00:01:51.289> the<00:01:51.380> remaining<00:01:51.829> four

00:01:51.999 --> 00:01:52.009 
we're going to cut the remaining four

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:53.319 
we're going to cut the remaining four
roses<00:01:52.280> and<00:01:52.729> we're<00:01:52.820> going<00:01:52.939> to<00:01:53.000> make<00:01:53.090> these<00:01:53.210> a

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:53.329 
roses and we're going to make these a

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:54.669 
roses and we're going to make these a
little<00:01:53.600> taller<00:01:53.840> so<00:01:54.200> they<00:01:54.380> give<00:01:54.530> the

00:01:54.669 --> 00:01:54.679 
little taller so they give the

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:56.649 
little taller so they give the
arrangements<00:01:55.130> of<00:01:55.189> height<00:01:55.429> so<00:01:55.700> maybe<00:01:56.270> about

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:56.659 
arrangements of height so maybe about

00:01:56.659 --> 00:01:58.719 
arrangements of height so maybe about
nine<00:01:56.990> or<00:01:57.140> ten<00:01:57.170> inches<00:01:57.649> and<00:01:58.340> we're<00:01:58.460> just<00:01:58.549> going

00:01:58.719 --> 00:01:58.729 
nine or ten inches and we're just going

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:01.719 
nine or ten inches and we're just going
to<00:01:58.789> arrange<00:01:59.060> those<00:01:59.270> in<00:01:59.509> the<00:01:59.600> middle<00:02:00.670> so<00:02:01.670> you

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:01.729 
to arrange those in the middle so you

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:03.760 
to arrange those in the middle so you
can<00:02:01.939> go<00:02:02.060> through<00:02:02.090> at<00:02:02.450> the<00:02:02.539> end<00:02:02.719> if<00:02:03.140> the<00:02:03.350> roses

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 
can go through at the end if the roses

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:05.410 
can go through at the end if the roses
aren't<00:02:04.100> as<00:02:04.189> open<00:02:04.609> as<00:02:04.880> you'd<00:02:05.149> like

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
aren't as open as you'd like

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.029 
aren't as open as you'd like

00:02:07.029 --> 00:02:07.039 
and just take your finger and move it in

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:08.650 
and just take your finger and move it in
a<00:02:07.070> counterclockwise<00:02:07.399> motion<00:02:08.300> through<00:02:08.630> the

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660 
a counterclockwise motion through the

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:10.480 
a counterclockwise motion through the
petals<00:02:09.140> and<00:02:09.350> you<00:02:09.440> can<00:02:09.560> open<00:02:09.740> them<00:02:09.950> up<00:02:10.009> just<00:02:10.369> a

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:10.490 
petals and you can open them up just a

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:12.670 
petals and you can open them up just a

craft store so our first step is to

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:25.570 
craft store so our first step is to
strip<00:02:22.910> all<00:02:23.180> of<00:02:23.300> these<00:02:23.450> roses<00:02:24.460> next<00:02:25.460> we're

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690 
be a little bit lower than the top of

00:02:34.119 --> 00:02:34.129 
now we're ready to cut the roses now

now we're ready to cut the roses now
you're<00:02:34.280> going<00:02:34.430> to<00:02:34.489> want<00:02:34.640> to<00:02:34.760> trim<00:02:35.000> them

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380 
you're going to want to trim them

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:37.140 
you're going to want to trim them
-<00:02:35.500> just<00:02:35.890> slightly<00:02:36.190> shorter<00:02:36.760> than<00:02:36.970> your

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
- just slightly shorter than your

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:38.970 
- just slightly shorter than your
container<00:02:37.600> and<00:02:38.230> you<00:02:38.440> want<00:02:38.590> to<00:02:38.680> cut<00:02:38.830> on<00:02:38.950> the

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
container and you want to cut on the

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:40.830 
container and you want to cut on the
diagonal<00:02:39.370> to<00:02:39.580> create<00:02:39.820> more<00:02:40.000> surface<00:02:40.450> space<00:02:40.630> so

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
diagonal to create more surface space so

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:42.300 
diagonal to create more surface space so
they<00:02:40.930> can<00:02:41.080> absorb<00:02:41.230> more<00:02:41.590> water<00:02:41.650> and<00:02:42.100> last

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
they can absorb more water and last

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:43.830 
they can absorb more water and last
longer<00:02:42.640> now<00:02:43.390> we're<00:02:43.540> going<00:02:43.630> to<00:02:43.690> start

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
longer now we're going to start

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.600 
longer now we're going to start
arranging<00:02:44.140> them<00:02:44.470> around<00:02:44.680> the<00:02:44.860> perimeter<00:02:45.010> I'd

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610 
arranging them around the perimeter I'd

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:47.820 
arranging them around the perimeter I'd
put<00:02:45.880> the<00:02:46.000> corners<00:02:46.420> in<00:02:46.600> on<00:02:46.810> a<00:02:46.840> slight<00:02:47.320> diagonal

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:47.830 
put the corners in on a slight diagonal

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:49.770 
put the corners in on a slight diagonal
and<00:02:48.490> then<00:02:48.730> just<00:02:48.970> make<00:02:49.120> sure<00:02:49.270> they're<00:02:49.420> barely

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
and then just make sure they're barely

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:51.780 
and then just make sure they're barely
touching<00:02:50.140> because<00:02:50.380> as<00:02:50.590> the<00:02:50.830> roses<00:02:51.250> open<00:02:51.640> up

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
touching because as the roses open up
