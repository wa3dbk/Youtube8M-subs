cooking<00:00:25.250> so<00:00:26.250> I<00:00:26.279> bought<00:00:26.699> one<00:00:26.730> these<00:00:26.939> containers

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
cooking so I bought one these containers

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.290 
cooking so I bought one these containers
from<00:00:27.779> the<00:00:27.930> lovely<00:00:28.109> you<00:00:29.070> guessed<00:00:29.310> it<00:00:29.490> Walmart<00:00:30.029> I

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
from the lovely you guessed it Walmart I

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.130 
from the lovely you guessed it Walmart I
think<00:00:30.990> it<00:00:31.050> was<00:00:31.140> like<00:00:31.260> 13<00:00:31.650> bucks<00:00:32.480> it<00:00:33.480> comes<00:00:33.809> with

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
think it was like 13 bucks it comes with

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.520 
think it was like 13 bucks it comes with
a<00:00:35.059> spout<00:00:36.059> spigot<00:00:36.780> whatever<00:00:37.110> you<00:00:37.200> want<00:00:37.320> to<00:00:37.380> call

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
a spout spigot whatever you want to call

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.420 
a spout spigot whatever you want to call
it<00:00:38.149> so<00:00:39.149> you<00:00:39.629> basically<00:00:39.930> just<00:00:40.200> turn<00:00:41.160> it<00:00:41.309> over

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
it so you basically just turn it over

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.180 
it so you basically just turn it over
and<00:00:41.610> turn<00:00:42.390> to<00:00:42.570> turn<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:43.500> knob<00:00:43.680> and<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:44.010> water

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
and turn to turn the knob and the water

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.549 
and turn to turn the knob and the water
comes<00:00:44.430> out<00:00:44.610> and<00:00:44.730> of<00:00:44.820> course<00:00:45.030> it's<00:00:45.210> got<00:00:45.559> the

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
comes out and of course it's got the

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:51.590 
comes out and of course it's got the
vent<00:00:46.800> I<00:00:47.629> think<00:00:48.629> it's<00:00:49.370> five<00:00:50.370> gallon<00:00:51.360> container

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
vent I think it's five gallon container

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.889 
vent I think it's five gallon container
I<00:00:52.379> believe<00:00:53.280> it<00:00:54.059> gets<00:00:54.149> very<00:00:54.360> heavy<00:00:54.539> when<00:00:54.750> it's

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
I believe it gets very heavy when it's

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.900 
I believe it gets very heavy when it's
full<00:00:55.079> right<00:00:55.949> now<00:00:56.070> I've<00:00:56.280> got<00:00:56.520> it<00:00:56.640> about<00:00:56.730> right

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.929 
to attempt
I<00:01:42.899> thought<00:01:43.619> about<00:01:43.890> mounting<00:01:44.310> it<00:01:44.399> up<00:01:44.520> here<00:01:44.790> out

I thought about mounting it up here out

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.859 
I thought about mounting it up here out
of<00:01:44.970> the<00:01:45.119> way<00:01:45.439> some<00:01:46.439> kind<00:01:46.619> of<00:01:46.680> shelving

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:47.869 
of the way some kind of shelving

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:49.789 
of the way some kind of shelving
something<00:01:48.869> to<00:01:48.930> give<00:01:49.079> off<00:01:49.229> the<00:01:49.259> focus<00:01:49.649> you<00:01:49.740> can

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
something to give off the focus you can

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:53.120 
something to give off the focus you can
see<00:01:50.070> I<00:01:50.100> don't<00:01:50.399> have<00:01:50.729> much<00:01:51.119> floor<00:01:51.479> space<00:01:52.130> of

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
see I don't have much floor space of

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.319 
see I don't have much floor space of
course<00:01:53.280> I<00:01:53.430> don't<00:01:53.579> need<00:01:53.759> much<00:01:54.000> floor<00:01:54.299> space

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329
