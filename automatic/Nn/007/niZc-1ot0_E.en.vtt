 You can use the effect of plush The following formula is born in battle by using flash 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:19.010
 It is 

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:22.370
 Plush timing is three times during the battle 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:26.750

 The flash timing of before one of the block from the battle start 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:41.240
 Flash timing can be used from block 

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:44.400
 At this time, Brocker emits flash timing 

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:48.250
 + Timing will move to attack ger 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:52.210
 Flash timing of the attack guard is smoked 8 without 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:53.810
 Since the flash timing passed each other, the flash timing before the block is 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:58.220
 It's over 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:01:04.580
 Block will choose the one received at or life block 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:08.290

 I also support the flush timing from the lock side at this time 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:18.630
 Use the Magic Flash Effect 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:22.240

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:38.570
 Help flash on attack side 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:40.480
 Use Prealfield to pay the cost using mitigation 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:44.950

 Shinryu Shining Dragon Stops Further Reverse + 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:03.090
 The battle is not over yet because the plus timing is alternate 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:07.030
 Pass-through in this case, if the flash timing of the block gar 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:11.390
 If it is the flash timing on the side to strike, the attack is also passing 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:14.810
 The flash timing is over because each other has passed the flush timing 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:19.270
 The battle is over and this battle is over 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:19.270
 Flash timing is at chest
