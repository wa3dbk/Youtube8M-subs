hello again this is video number four on

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:04.730 
hello again this is video number four on
adjusting<00:00:03.000> your<00:00:03.210> underwater<00:00:03.689> photos<00:00:04.410> with

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:04.740 
adjusting your underwater photos with

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.940 
adjusting your underwater photos with
adobe<00:00:05.250> photoshop<00:00:06.350> so<00:00:07.350> now<00:00:07.649> we're<00:00:07.770> going<00:00:07.890> to

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950 
adobe photoshop so now we're going to

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.060 
adobe photoshop so now we're going to
adjust<00:00:08.189> the<00:00:09.080> color<00:00:10.080> saturation<00:00:10.290> the

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
adjust the color saturation the

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.249 
adjust the color saturation the
intensity<00:00:11.490> of<00:00:11.610> the<00:00:11.670> color<00:00:11.759> before<00:00:12.719> I<00:00:12.960> do<00:00:13.230> that

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
intensity of the color before I do that

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.269 
intensity of the color before I do that
I'm<00:00:14.040> just<00:00:14.099> going<00:00:14.549> to<00:00:15.859> flatten<00:00:16.859> all<00:00:17.039> these

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
I'm just going to flatten all these

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.080 
I'm just going to flatten all these
layers<00:00:17.609> together<00:00:18.619> so<00:00:19.619> I'm<00:00:19.859> going<00:00:19.920> to<00:00:20.220> hide<00:00:20.789> the

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
layers together so I'm going to hide the

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.009 
layers together so I'm going to hide the
background<00:00:21.510> layer<00:00:21.720> that<00:00:22.109> we<00:00:22.430> duplicated<00:00:23.430> and

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:24.019 
background layer that we duplicated and

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:32.319 
background layer that we duplicated and
just<00:00:25.019> right-click<00:00:25.680> and<00:00:26.460> do<00:00:27.269> merge<00:00:27.750> visible

00:00:32.319 --> 00:00:32.329 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:36.410 

and<00:00:33.920> now<00:00:34.920> i'm<00:00:35.070> going<00:00:35.280> to<00:00:35.460> choose<00:00:35.940> another

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
and now i'm going to choose another

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.990 
and now i'm going to choose another
adjustment<00:00:37.320> layer<00:00:37.860> creating<00:00:38.700> fill<00:00:38.879> or

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
adjustment layer creating fill or

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.410 
adjustment layer creating fill or
adjustment<00:00:39.030> layer<00:00:39.860> this<00:00:40.860> time<00:00:41.219> i'm<00:00:41.640> doing<00:00:42.090> hue

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
adjustment layer this time i'm doing hue

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.049 
adjustment layer this time i'm doing hue
saturation<00:00:43.100> and<00:00:44.100> i'm<00:00:44.340> just<00:00:44.520> going<00:00:44.640> to<00:00:44.820> boost

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
saturation and i'm just going to boost

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:51.830 
saturation and i'm just going to boost
this<00:00:45.780> saturation<00:00:46.440> up<00:00:46.710> to<00:00:46.920> about<00:00:47.129> 22<00:00:48.030> 23<00:00:50.840> so

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
this saturation up to about 22 23 so

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.360 
this saturation up to about 22 23 so
okay<00:00:52.170> i<00:00:52.469> just<00:00:54.020> hide<00:00:55.020> that<00:00:55.260> way<00:00:55.530> and<00:00:55.949> just<00:00:56.129> see

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.760 
okay i just hide that way and just see
the<00:00:56.520> boosting<00:00:56.969> color<00:00:57.270> their<00:00:57.539> spring<00:00:58.530> the<00:00:58.620> job

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
the boosting color their spring the job

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.959 
the boosting color their spring the job
nicely<00:01:00.289> the<00:01:01.289> final<00:01:01.739> thing<00:01:01.770> we<00:01:01.949> want<00:01:02.219> to<00:01:02.280> do<00:01:02.460> i'm

nicely the final thing we want to do i'm
just<00:01:03.180> gonna<00:01:03.510> hide<00:01:04.019> that<00:01:04.290> background<00:01:04.830> layer

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
just gonna hide that background layer

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.530 
just gonna hide that background layer
again<00:01:05.220> and<00:01:06.350> flat<00:01:07.350> from<00:01:07.530> the<00:01:07.650> image<00:01:07.860> again<00:01:08.540> you

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
again and flat from the image again you

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.539 
again and flat from the image again you
merge<00:01:09.869> visible<00:01:12.110> and<00:01:13.110> this<00:01:13.590> time<00:01:13.860> i'm<00:01:14.100> going<00:01:14.280> to

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
merge visible and this time i'm going to

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.719 
merge visible and this time i'm going to
duplicate<00:01:15.380> this<00:01:16.380> layer<00:01:16.439> by<00:01:17.009> dragging<00:01:17.430> it<00:01:17.490> onto

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
duplicate this layer by dragging it onto

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.410 
duplicate this layer by dragging it onto
the<00:01:18.000> create<00:01:18.540> a<00:01:18.600> new<00:01:18.750> layer<00:01:18.990> icon<00:01:19.080> and<00:01:20.270> then<00:01:21.270> i'm

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
the create a new layer icon and then i'm

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.230 
the create a new layer icon and then i'm
going<00:01:21.570> to<00:01:21.659> change<00:01:22.080> the<00:01:22.619> blending<00:01:23.400> mode<00:01:23.430> with

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
going to change the blending mode with

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.660 
going to change the blending mode with
this<00:01:24.450> box<00:01:24.810> up<00:01:25.080> here<00:01:25.290> so<00:01:26.220> multiply<00:01:28.310> there<00:01:29.310> we<00:01:29.490> go

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
this box up here so multiply there we go

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.080 
this box up here so multiply there we go
because<00:01:30.390> rather<00:01:31.020> dark<00:01:31.470> and<00:01:31.890> murky<00:01:32.100> but<00:01:32.909> now

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
because rather dark and murky but now

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.469 
because rather dark and murky but now
i'm<00:01:33.210> going<00:01:33.360> to<00:01:33.479> drag<00:01:34.200> your<00:01:34.470> pasty<00:01:35.100> bike

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:35.479 
i'm going to drag your pasty bike

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:42.130 
i'm going to drag your pasty bike
remember<00:01:36.479> like<00:01:36.770> ten<00:01:37.770> percent<00:01:39.229> like<00:01:40.229> that

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.140 
remember like ten percent like that

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.170 
remember like ten percent like that
just<00:01:42.860> to<00:01:42.979> give<00:01:43.100> them<00:01:43.220> a<00:01:43.250> bit<00:01:43.400> more<00:01:43.550> punch<00:01:43.850> to

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:44.180 
just to give them a bit more punch to

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:51.460 
just to give them a bit more punch to
the<00:01:44.210> picture<00:01:44.720> I<00:01:45.070> just<00:01:46.070> hide<00:01:46.610> that<00:01:50.229> see<00:01:51.229> just

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:51.470 
the picture I just hide that see just

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:54.180 
the picture I just hide that see just
gives<00:01:51.979> a<00:01:52.070> bit<00:01:52.190> more<00:01:52.340> richness<00:01:52.640> to<00:01:52.909> the<00:01:53.150> picture

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:54.190 
gives a bit more richness to the picture

00:01:54.190 --> 00:02:03.580 
gives a bit more richness to the picture
so<00:01:55.900> if<00:01:56.900> we<00:02:00.040> just<00:02:01.540> drag<00:02:02.540> this<00:02:02.690> up<00:02:02.900> to<00:02:03.080> the<00:02:03.170> top<00:02:03.410> I

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590 
so if we just drag this up to the top I

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:07.390 
so if we just drag this up to the top I
can't<00:02:03.890> do<00:02:04.100> that<00:02:04.130> I<00:02:04.550> need<00:02:04.790> to<00:02:05.060> rename<00:02:05.930> it<00:02:06.400> just

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:07.400 
can't do that I need to rename it just

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.130 
can't do that I need to rename it just
drag<00:02:07.670> that<00:02:07.700> up<00:02:07.909> to<00:02:08.119> the<00:02:08.209> top<00:02:08.479> so<00:02:08.780> that<00:02:08.810> we<00:02:08.959> can

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
drag that up to the top so that we can

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:16.870 
drag that up to the top so that we can
show<00:02:10.130> you<00:02:13.780> what<00:02:14.780> we<00:02:14.900> started<00:02:15.320> out<00:02:15.440> with<00:02:15.880> that's

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 
show you what we started out with that's

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.440 
show you what we started out with that's
what<00:02:17.060> we<00:02:17.150> start<00:02:17.420> out<00:02:17.630> with<00:02:18.970> and<00:02:19.970> that's<00:02:20.269> what

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
what we start out with and that's what

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:22.960 
what we start out with and that's what
we<00:02:20.540> finish<00:02:20.840> with<00:02:20.989> a<00:02:21.290> great<00:02:21.830> improvement<00:02:22.280> and

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
we finish with a great improvement and

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:25.989 
we finish with a great improvement and
something<00:02:23.330> you'd<00:02:23.630> be<00:02:23.780> proud
