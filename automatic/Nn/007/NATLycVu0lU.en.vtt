00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.280
 We are presenting today a note regarding bamboo tents 

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:19.509
 of our Huawei company in these letters have 

00:00:19.509 --> 00:00:24.199
 different peculiarities is from the raw material of the terminations of the 

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:29.839
 7 seam comes with a reinforced floor p practically 210 grams per meter 

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:30.890
 square 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:35.579
 st accrue compared to one of a supermarket whatever the brand goes 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.430
 to find for less than half the thickness of the ticks of the floor of our 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:40.210
 letter 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:43.480
 that makes you the first exit in you do 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:48.370
 in the tent will be formed with holes will happen good water that with 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:51.980
 this tent did not pass due to the density it has per square meter 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:56.610
 one of the most important features p the heat-sealed seams 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.140
 everywhere, fraiz info the PurÃ©pechas as we did 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:05.020
 because because at the moment there are those summer storms that sometimes are 

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:07.190
 very strong and with lateral winds 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:09.530
 the report of the heat-sealed seams 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.580
 so no water does not enter by any 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:15.750
 is that one of the possibilities that can come in the water 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.820
 and the other would be on the bottom of the letter just to prevent 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.150
 of that problem that can happen with other types of tents we did 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:31.119
 some flaps almost 25 centimeters long for haiti larrea in jail 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:35.950
 must pay the part of the roof copper work place of the earth say 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:39.950
 will build tent then cover with dirt or sand depends where you are and the 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:41.070
 another on day 20 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.500
 low and follow the interest of your course to not send was worked on demand 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:51.400
 another advantage is practically the thickness of the fabrics of the roof covers 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:55.430
 that in this case well we are doing it with two thousand millimeters 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:00.229
 of water impermeability or if in addition to the seam heat-sealed and the fabric is 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:04.910
 very finite kilos let's say percent in which the grid of the fabric is 

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:09.509
 very wide the water can come to pass through there and another of the thing for that matter 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:14.210
 of the heat that our tents have the copper roof counted aluminized 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:14.920
 inside 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.260
 what does this mean that in the event that this one to the radiant sun the rays 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.640
 ultraviolet previously will not happen 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:26.490
 because this not with the aluminum used will bounce and it will happen beforehand 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:29.049
