00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:05.860
 I've been busy reviewing studying for 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:08.970

 give them something that may interest them 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:29.140
 it is a compilation of more than 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:30.970
 50 programming books all 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:32.320
 programming languages in many 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:35.650
 levels for anyone to 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:38.650
 start learning is not like many 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:40.930
 they think I should have knowledge 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:43.510
 previous to start reading these 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:46.150
 books is not to learn from scratch 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:49.900
 I'm going let's say I do not know anything about a language 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:52.690
 of programming anyone by saying php 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:55.900
 and I want to learn it from one of the 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:57.820
 books as a course because they're going to 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:00.670
 serve a lot then to think 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:03.260
 designed for people who know nothing 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:06.230
 I will leave them as 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:08.330
 a file in this link 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:12.040
 download I leave it in the description 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:14.700
 of this video is in mega 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:18.250
 and this later when they unzip it 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:21.960
 we are going to find these two 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:24.300
 folders where soto of files sorry 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:26.220
 this folder mega mega tutorial 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:29.550
 collection of manuals and books 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:31.800
 programming the lm file that is very 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:35.450
 important equally william for 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.450
 clarify some doubts 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:48.300
 It is important that they read it because the 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.620
 information 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:55.349
 about how 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:55.349
 how could we release this great contribution 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:03.349
 very well in the folder we found 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:07.189
 separated this by books we see that there 

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:12.739
 of s &amp; p from that site 

00:03:07.189 --> 00:03:16.269
 circus that and hygiene your html already go to 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:21.019
 writing with pascal terry php 

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:24.260
 general programming ruby visual python 

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:26.319
 basic and game development for 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:29.350
 windows phone 

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:32.010
 as we see each of the 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:35.659
 sections contain 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:35.659
 and works in pdf format 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:41.330
 they are not the same in each case 

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:43.270
 example there can sometimes be two in 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:47.130
 fasting and 

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:50.490
 by saying in php 3 and so on 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:52.380
 of the same number of books per each 

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:55.160
 category 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:59.650
 There is something that 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:59.650
 I found detached where is 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:07.620
 a php that apart from the books that are 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:11.840
 three 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:15.060
 there is also a full php course 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:18.180
 starting from the appendix course 123 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:20.850
 until course number 20 which is the 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:23.550
 last part so that there is everything that is 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:27.150
 equally with this classes this visual 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:29.550
 basic there are also visual basic courses 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:31.380
 here in the visual basic books 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:34.070
 we can also find visual basic 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:38.440
 net point 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:38.440
 and enter something like a sp 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:44.970
 Well, here I leave this great 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:47.540
 contribution I know that many are going to 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:47.540
 enjoy 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:53.150
 soon I will come with another very 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:55.260
 similar to this but more focused on what 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:58.260
 what web 

00:04:55.260 --> 00:05:00.470
 if web host and servers the whole theory 

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:02.900
 server 

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:04.320
 language from side to client server 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:07.230
 served 

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:09.090
 but in the meantime remember that we 

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:12.810

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:11.960
 grow community 

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:13.420
 soon I will continue with 

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:17.330
 with video 

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:21.090
 with its full php and mysql 

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:24.040
 and it made several people have been me 

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:26.860
 saying that 

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:31.810
 that I'm copying the course of another 

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:33.650
 part may not, it's something that goes more 

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:37.310
 beyond that 

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:39.830
 they are telling me good I will say the 

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:42.590
 cansino name caesar teacher 

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:45.090
 has many courses too many courses or 

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:47.310
 of many things 

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:49.360
 I'm taking how the courses do 

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:52.090
 why 

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:54.129
 I already for example I have read all 

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:57.129
 these manuals the books generation of 

00:06:54.129 --> 00:06:59.919
 dynamic website with html all the course 

00:06:57.129 --> 00:07:02.259
 from php I have read it and some books 

00:06:59.919 --> 00:07:03.490
 more I have seen too many courses studied 

00:07:02.259 --> 00:07:05.169
 much 

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:07.060
 I have also seen the videos of the 

00:07:05.169 --> 00:07:09.759
 master caesar cancino and I've taken them 

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:13.509
 as a base methodology for what they are 

00:07:09.759 --> 00:07:15.550
 I learn them because I think that 

00:07:13.509 --> 00:07:18.039
 for people who are just starting 

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:21.319
 to program 

00:07:18.039 --> 00:07:23.090
 advantage to my big the way it is 

00:07:21.319 --> 00:07:25.080
 can explain 

00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:27.620
 Each theme 

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:27.620
 but 

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:37.259
 well my advantage is my goal simply 

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.259
 is to help is not to copy anyone 

00:07:37.529 --> 00:07:43.169
 Any doubt that you have me 

00:07:39.749 --> 00:07:47.279
 can you get my channel to the 

00:07:43.169 --> 00:07:50.089
 website is still there is construction already 

00:07:47.279 --> 00:07:50.089
 we almost finished it 

00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:57.100
 equally to our facebook page 

00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:59.180
 or to our twitter 

00:07:57.100 --> 00:08:01.820
 Y 

00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:04.460
 it is simply this here I see it with 

00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:08.129
 that great gift 

00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:11.129
 I hope you pass it to your friends 

00:08:08.129 --> 00:08:15.439
 and that was all for today my 

00:08:11.129 --> 00:08:15.439
 name is manny ramÃ­rez thank you very much
