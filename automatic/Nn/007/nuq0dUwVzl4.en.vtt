00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.280
 the staff is in the air plus a gringo and 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.900
 Today I'm going to show you a good tip. 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.880
 of some snacks there that are 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.799
 served in trays and several times of 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.020
 out and that is a cool tip for us 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.369
 here because Brazil is used 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.529
 brie cheese and that is what I think 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.150
 people almost do not use here for snacks 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.830
 so come with me to follow the 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.600
 ingredients and see how it's done 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.490
 We're going to need wheat flour. 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.349
 Here I have a cup. 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.730
 but depends on the amount of cheese you 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:36.360
 You will make it clear and 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:39.989
 egg white flour thread flour 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:43.170
 today was a used here neither the package and the 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:45.180
 Brie cheese and good type to begin 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.120
 so we're going to cut the cheese in 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.010
 slices a bit longer not so 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.590
 because otherwise he does not 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.719
 I wish I should stay after slicing. 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.300
 what it should be more or less of that 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:59.250
 size here that you are seeing more 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.469
 or less so in not so small pieces 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.910
 large and also not so small then 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.909
 now we will start 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:12.270
 mixing carry and black pepper 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:18.869
 in our thread flour and then we go 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:21.299
 beat a little egg and then we go 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:24.920
 Then get the cheese through 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.920
 first in wheat flour 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:42.810
 to know a little tight and then we go 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:45.290
 pass it in the egg and in the sequence in the 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.290
 breadcrumbs 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:00.510
 Good now we'll do this with 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:02.550
 several little pieces and there we go 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:04.620
 prepare the eye to be crazy but 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:06.960
 Who says that we're ready now we're going 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:11.030
 stay then we'll get a 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.030
 piece in oil already hot and we won 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:30.540
 the fries our snacks are already 

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:33.450
 ready to be served and you can 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:35.099
 serve with more sour mondinense jelly 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.860
 or with a sauce of your choice 

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:40.110
