increases the compression a little bit
which<00:00:35.010> I'll<00:00:35.190> demonstrate<00:00:36.079> it's<00:00:37.340> remarkably

00:00:49.140 --> 00:01:42.990 
then with a little bit more of an
overdrive<00:00:49.620> so<00:00:49.890> you<00:00:49.980> can<00:00:50.070> get<00:00:50.160> a<00:00:50.190> sense<00:00:50.460> of<00:00:50.640> it

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:43.000 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.870 

you

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:50.869 
now I'll give it a little bit more of an

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:54.160 
now I'll give it a little bit more of an
overdrive<00:01:51.850> plugging<00:01:52.850> in<00:01:53.030> this<00:01:53.240> pressing

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170 
overdrive plugging in this pressing

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:56.130 
overdrive plugging in this pressing
little<00:01:54.439> more<00:01:54.590> to<00:01:54.740> the<00:01:54.830> compression<00:01:55.369> button

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:56.140 
little more to the compression button

00:01:56.140 --> 00:03:02.220 
little more to the compression button
and<00:01:57.140> giving<00:01:57.439> it<00:01:57.560> a<00:01:57.649> little<00:01:57.830> bit<00:01:57.950> more<00:01:58.220> gain

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.230 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:04:03.950 

and<00:03:03.230> if<00:03:03.440> we<00:03:03.560> really<00:03:03.860> want<00:03:03.950> to<00:03:04.190> crack<00:03:04.430> it

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:03.960 

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:11.309
