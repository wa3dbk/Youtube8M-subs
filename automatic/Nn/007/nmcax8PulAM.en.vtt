all the treatment alternatives for pets
in<00:01:10.439> pain<00:01:10.619> I<00:01:11.360> think<00:01:12.360> you<00:01:12.810> need<00:01:12.930> to<00:01:13.020> take<00:01:13.140> a<00:01:13.170> step

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
in pain I think you need to take a step

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.560 
in pain I think you need to take a step
back<00:01:13.619> and<00:01:14.159> differentiate<00:01:14.880> between<00:01:15.030> the<00:01:15.360> two<00:01:15.390> I

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
back and differentiate between the two I

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.140 
back and differentiate between the two I
think<00:01:15.750> all<00:01:16.290> too<00:01:16.470> often<00:01:16.650> th<00:01:17.100> is<00:01:17.310> use<00:01:17.729> has<00:01:17.970> been

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
think all too often th is use has been

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.380 
think all too often th is use has been
synonymous<00:01:18.600> with<00:01:19.500> cannabis<00:01:20.189> or<00:01:20.310> marijuana

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:20.390 
synonymous with cannabis or marijuana

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
useful for certain conditions but it's

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.300 
useful for certain conditions but it's
really<00:01:34.170> some<00:01:34.380> of<00:01:34.470> these<00:01:34.560> other<00:01:34.770> ingredients

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.090 
really some of these other ingredients
that<00:01:35.369> has<00:01:35.759> is<00:01:35.970> excited<00:01:36.479> is<00:01:37.020> that<00:01:37.380> is<00:01:37.590> that<00:01:37.860> why

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
that has is excited is that is that why

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.899 
that has is excited is that is that why
the<00:01:39.290> synthetically<00:01:40.290> manufactured<00:01:40.770> THC<00:01:41.610> pills

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
the synthetically manufactured THC pills

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.460 
the synthetically manufactured THC pills
when<00:01:42.570> they<00:01:42.750> give<00:01:42.899> them<00:01:43.049> to<00:01:43.140> people<00:01:43.380> with

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
when they give them to people with

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.530 
when they give them to people with
cancer<00:01:43.770> and<00:01:44.130> chemo<00:01:44.490> and<00:01:44.670> whatnot<00:01:45.000> they<00:01:45.329> say

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
cancer and chemo and whatnot they say

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.060 
cancer and chemo and whatnot they say
that<00:01:45.750> they<00:01:45.840> don't<00:01:45.960> work<00:01:46.290> as<00:01:46.470> well<00:01:46.649> as<00:01:46.799> pot

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
that they don't work as well as pot

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.740 
that they don't work as well as pot
because<00:01:47.490> of<00:01:47.610> these<00:01:47.729> other<00:01:47.880> synergistic<00:01:48.600> and

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
because of these other synergistic and

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.569 
because of these other synergistic and
or<00:01:49.140> just<00:01:49.350> other<00:01:49.590> altogether<00:01:50.220> different

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
or just other altogether different

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.429 
or just other altogether different
compounds<00:01:51.180> and<00:01:51.299> if<00:01:51.360> so<00:01:51.509> what<00:01:52.049> are<00:01:52.079> some<00:01:52.229> of

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439

compounds and if so what are some of
those<00:01:52.560> compounds<00:01:53.509> yeah<00:01:54.540> that's<00:01:54.899> precisely

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
those compounds yeah that's precisely

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.350 
those compounds yeah that's precisely
right<00:01:55.619> there's<00:01:56.070> time<00:01:56.280> compounds<00:01:57.149> that<00:01:57.240> we're

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
right there's time compounds that we're

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.300 
right there's time compounds that we're
only<00:01:57.540> now<00:01:57.750> beginning<00:01:57.960> to<00:01:58.229> explore<00:01:59.100> the
