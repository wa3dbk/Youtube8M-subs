00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
here broke trying to remember exactly a

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:23.260 
here broke trying to remember exactly a
couple<00:01:16.350> parts<00:01:16.650> came<00:01:16.860> out<00:01:17.070> of<00:01:17.220> it<00:01:17.340> to<00:01:17.520> somewhere

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:23.270 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:29.000 

it's<00:01:24.270> way<00:01:24.600> too<00:01:24.659> like<00:01:25.320> these<00:01:25.590> still<00:01:26.040> I<00:01:27.920> want<00:01:28.920> to

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
say it was something like a nylon

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:36.080 
say it was something like a nylon
bushing<00:01:32.810> came<00:01:33.810> out<00:01:33.990> of<00:01:34.140> this<00:01:34.729> but<00:01:35.729> either<00:01:35.880> way

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
bushing came out of this but either way

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.420 
bushing came out of this but either way

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
when you go to tune the string and you

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.000 
when you go to tune the string and you
get<00:01:38.580> some<00:01:38.760> tension<00:01:39.000> on<00:01:39.360> it<00:01:39.390> these<00:01:40.320> things<00:01:40.590> just

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:41.010

playing<00:03:58.879> but<00:03:59.879> I<00:04:00.510> enjoyed<00:04:01.170> it<00:04:01.670> every<00:04:02.670> time<00:04:02.969> I

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
playing but I enjoyed it every time I

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:06.039 
playing but I enjoyed it every time I
turn<00:04:03.359> around<00:04:03.389> is<00:04:04.200> it's<00:04:04.709> some<00:04:05.370> little<00:04:05.669> thing

00:04:06.039 --> 00:04:06.049 
turn around is it's some little thing

00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:09.379 
turn around is it's some little thing
and<00:04:07.049> I<00:04:08.040> guess<00:04:08.370> it's<00:04:08.549> like<00:04:08.609> a<00:04:08.730> car<00:04:09.030> when<00:04:09.239> it

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:09.389

00:04:09.389 --> 00:04:12.339 
and I guess it's like a car when it
starts<00:04:09.689> giving<00:04:09.840> you<00:04:10.019> trouble<00:04:10.319> you<00:04:10.590> want<00:04:10.829> to
