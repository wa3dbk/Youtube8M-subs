update on the redstone trumpet that I

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.570 
update on the redstone trumpet that I
made<00:00:06.839> and<00:00:07.049> I'm<00:00:07.830> going<00:00:08.099> to<00:00:08.189> be<00:00:08.309> brain

introducing to you
version<00:00:10.530> 2.0<00:00:11.340> much<00:00:12.300> improved<00:00:12.690> and<00:00:12.870> much

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
version 2.0 much improved and much

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.390 
version 2.0 much improved and much
slimmed<00:00:13.410> down<00:00:13.500> version<00:00:14.360> of<00:00:15.360> 1.0<00:00:16.350> but<00:00:16.560> I'm

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
slimmed down version of 1.0 but I'm

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.240 
slimmed down version of 1.0 but I'm
going<00:00:18.240> to<00:00:18.470> quickly<00:00:19.470> show<00:00:19.710> you<00:00:19.740> the<00:00:19.830> difference

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
going to quickly show you the difference

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.189 
going to quickly show you the difference
so<00:00:20.369> that<00:00:20.490> I'm<00:00:20.580> going<00:00:20.820> to<00:00:20.970> explain<00:00:21.570> it<00:00:21.750> a<00:00:21.869> little

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
so that I'm going to explain it a little

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:23.300 
so that I'm going to explain it a little
bit<00:00:22.380> more<00:00:22.529> again<00:00:22.740> a<00:00:22.859> little<00:00:22.980> bit<00:00:23.160> better

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
bit more again a little bit better

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.599 
bit more again a little bit better
exactly<00:00:24.119> why<00:00:24.359> they<00:00:24.510> changed<00:00:24.779> notes<00:00:24.960> so

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:25.609 
exactly why they changed notes so

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:33.590 
exactly why they changed notes so
version<00:00:26.609> 1<00:00:26.820> version<00:00:28.250> 2<00:00:29.539> alright<00:00:30.539> so<00:00:32.450> like<00:00:33.450> I

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
version 1 version 2 alright so like I

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.209 
version 1 version 2 alright so like I
said<00:00:33.660> last<00:00:33.930> time<00:00:34.079> in<00:00:34.320> case<00:00:34.469> you<00:00:34.590> didn't<00:00:35.160> see

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
said last time in case you didn't see

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.650 
said last time in case you didn't see
the<00:00:35.370> last<00:00:35.550> of<00:00:35.730> our<00:00:36.000> last<00:00:36.680> version<00:00:38.329> the<00:00:39.329> trumpet

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
the last of our last version the trumpet

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.520 
the last of our last version the trumpet
changes<00:00:40.050> notes<00:00:40.320> using<00:00:41.280> 3<00:00:41.700> valves<00:00:42.210> 1<00:00:42.750> 2<00:00:43.200> and<00:00:43.440> 3

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
changes notes using 3 valves 1 2 and 3

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.680 
changes notes using 3 valves 1 2 and 3
and<00:00:43.879> each<00:00:44.879> note<00:00:45.570> opens<00:00:46.350> the<00:00:46.890> airway<00:00:47.219> two<00:00:47.690> more

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
and each note opens the airway two more

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.850 
and each note opens the airway two more
tubing<00:00:49.320> the<00:00:49.980> longer<00:00:50.280> the<00:00:50.399> tubing<00:00:51.170> the<00:00:52.170> lower

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
tubing the longer the tubing the lower

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.400 
tubing the longer the tubing the lower
the<00:00:53.070> note<00:00:53.219> so<00:00:53.489> say<00:00:53.670> the<00:00:53.789> tubing<00:00:54.180> was<00:00:55.020> coming

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
the note so say the tubing was coming

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:56.660 
the note so say the tubing was coming
down<00:00:55.559> and<00:00:55.590> going<00:00:55.920> through<00:00:56.129> the<00:00:56.219> valves<00:00:56.520> out

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
down and going through the valves out

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.740 
down and going through the valves out
into<00:00:56.910> the<00:00:57.030> Bell<00:00:57.180> to<00:00:57.899> be<00:00:58.020> played<00:00:59.539> this<00:01:00.539> will

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
into the Bell to be played this will

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.670 
into the Bell to be played this will
produce<00:01:01.050> a<00:01:01.320> fairly<00:01:01.649> high<00:01:01.829> note<00:01:02.100> but<00:01:02.850> if<00:01:02.969> we<00:01:03.680> say

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
produce a fairly high note but if we say

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:12.350 
produce a fairly high note but if we say
were<00:01:04.979> to<00:01:05.900> lower<00:01:06.900> it<00:01:09.260> using<00:01:10.260> this<00:01:11.189> valve<00:01:11.520> it

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
were to lower it using this valve it

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.570 
were to lower it using this valve it
would<00:01:12.510> go<00:01:12.659> through<00:01:13.020> this<00:01:13.200> valve<00:01:13.590> out<00:01:13.890> into

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
would go through this valve out into

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.910 
would go through this valve out into
this<00:01:14.729> tube<00:01:15.119> back<00:01:15.509> out<00:01:15.750> and<00:01:15.960> through<00:01:16.259> the

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
this tube back out and through the

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.570 
this tube back out and through the
slowing<00:01:17.400> it<00:01:17.549> 1<00:01:18.119> you<00:01:18.900> know<00:01:19.049> little<00:01:19.380> segment<00:01:20.340> and

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
slowing it 1 you know little segment and

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.969 
slowing it 1 you know little segment and
that<00:01:20.610> would<00:01:21.180> be<00:01:21.299> a<00:01:21.330> chromatic<00:01:21.780> note<00:01:21.960> it<00:01:22.860> would

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
that would be a chromatic note it would

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.370 
that would be a chromatic note it would
be<00:01:23.100> lowered<00:01:23.369> 1<00:01:23.520> chromatic<00:01:23.970> note<00:01:24.259> and<00:01:25.259> then

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
be lowered 1 chromatic note and then

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.039 
be lowered 1 chromatic note and then
this<00:01:25.500> would<00:01:25.680> be<00:01:25.799> 2<00:01:26.189> chromatic<00:01:26.670> notes<00:01:27.049> because

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
this would be 2 chromatic notes because

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.620 
this would be 2 chromatic notes because
it<00:01:28.320> it's<00:01:29.159> double<00:01:29.820> the<00:01:29.939> amount<00:01:30.180> of<00:01:30.210> tubing

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
it it's double the amount of tubing

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.170 
it it's double the amount of tubing
taken<00:01:31.049> out<00:01:31.170> and<00:01:31.350> you<00:01:32.189> don't<00:01:32.369> you<00:01:32.579> don't<00:01:32.729> use<00:01:32.850> 3

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
taken out and you don't you don't use 3

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.960 
taken out and you don't you don't use 3
you<00:01:33.329> actually<00:01:33.600> use<00:01:33.689> 1<00:01:33.900> and<00:01:34.020> 2<00:01:34.229> and<00:01:34.939> so<00:01:35.939> on

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
you actually use 1 and 2 and so on

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.840 
you actually use 1 and 2 and so on
there's<00:01:36.360> a<00:01:36.390> total<00:01:36.659> of<00:01:36.689> 7<00:01:37.049> combinations<00:01:37.729> so<00:01:38.729> I<00:01:38.790> a

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
there's a total of 7 combinations so I a

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:46.280 
there's a total of 7 combinations so I a
total<00:01:39.479> of<00:01:39.689> 7<00:01:41.210> different<00:01:43.520> and<00:01:44.570> gates<00:01:45.570> each<00:01:46.079> with

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
total of 7 different and gates each with

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.260 
total of 7 different and gates each with
four<00:01:46.530> inputs<00:01:46.680> one<00:01:47.189> for<00:01:47.460> the<00:01:47.520> mouthpiece<00:01:47.939> for

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
four inputs one for the mouthpiece for

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.410 
four inputs one for the mouthpiece for
the<00:01:48.810> thing<00:01:48.990> playing<00:01:49.229> the<00:01:49.350> note<00:01:49.500> and<00:01:50.060> 3<00:01:51.060> for<00:01:51.329> the

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
the thing playing the note and 3 for the

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.560 
the thing playing the note and 3 for the
three<00:01:51.689> valves<00:01:51.899> and<00:01:52.290> so<00:01:52.979> I<00:01:53.250> can<00:01:53.880> explain<00:01:54.360> to<00:01:54.540> you

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
three valves and so I can explain to you

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.260 
three valves and so I can explain to you
that<00:01:55.380> the<00:01:55.530> reason<00:01:55.920> that<00:01:56.070> this<00:01:56.219> was<00:01:56.430> so<00:01:56.700> bulky

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
that the reason that this was so bulky

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.380 
that the reason that this was so bulky
is<00:01:57.570> because<00:01:57.840> I<00:01:57.930> used<00:01:58.140> a<00:01:58.439> and<00:01:58.710> gate<00:01:59.240> similar<00:02:00.240> to

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
is because I used a and gate similar to

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.810 
is because I used a and gate similar to
this<00:02:00.540> one<00:02:00.750> where<00:02:01.100> if<00:02:02.100> you<00:02:02.280> think<00:02:02.490> about<00:02:02.670> it

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
this one where if you think about it

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.330 
this one where if you think about it
you're<00:02:03.479> trying<00:02:03.600> to<00:02:03.780> turn<00:02:03.899> this<00:02:04.049> one<00:02:04.200> on<00:02:04.439> this

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
you're trying to turn this one on this

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.540 
you're trying to turn this one on this
torch<00:02:06.270> on<00:02:06.509> so<00:02:07.020> you<00:02:07.110> want<00:02:07.200> to<00:02:07.350> turn<00:02:07.469> this<00:02:07.710> off

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
torch on so you want to turn this off

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.180 
torch on so you want to turn this off
and<00:02:08.789> it's<00:02:09.390> fairly<00:02:10.080> simply<00:02:10.530> that<00:02:10.830> just<00:02:11.009> means

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
and it's fairly simply that just means

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.910 
and it's fairly simply that just means
that<00:02:11.250> you<00:02:11.370> need<00:02:11.520> to<00:02:11.640> have<00:02:11.730> both<00:02:11.910> off

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
that you need to have both off

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.130

you<00:02:13.040> tear<00:02:13.220> this<00:02:13.340> one<00:02:13.490> and<00:02:13.730> this<00:02:14.030> one<00:02:14.090> off<00:02:14.330> but

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
you tear this one and this one off but

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:16.990 
you tear this one and this one off but
you<00:02:15.230> can<00:02:15.290> also<00:02:15.500> do<00:02:15.740> it<00:02:15.860> in<00:02:15.950> a<00:02:16.069> variety<00:02:16.250> of<00:02:16.640> ways

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
you can also do it in a variety of ways

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.199 
you can also do it in a variety of ways

I'm<00:02:40.580> sorry<00:02:40.940> I<00:02:41.950> used<00:02:42.950> this<00:02:43.940> over<00:02:44.900> and<00:02:45.019> over<00:02:45.110> and

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
I'm sorry I used this over and over and

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.979 
I'm sorry I used this over and over and
knees<00:02:46.150> to<00:02:47.150> create<00:02:47.510> four<00:02:48.200> inputs<00:02:48.650> I<00:02:48.890> used<00:02:49.760> one

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:49.989 
knees to create four inputs I used one

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:56.860 
knees to create four inputs I used one
here<00:02:51.519> one<00:02:52.519> here<00:02:52.549> and<00:02:54.069> one<00:02:55.069> here<00:02:55.390> to<00:02:56.390> merge<00:02:56.630> the

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
here one here and one here to merge the

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:00.039 
here one here and one here to merge the
two<00:02:56.900> signals<00:02:57.440> from<00:02:57.530> both<00:02:57.620> of<00:02:57.860> these<00:02:58.360> so<00:02:59.360> if<00:02:59.600> you

00:03:00.039 --> 00:03:00.049 
two signals from both of these so if you

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:04.090 
two signals from both of these so if you
if<00:03:00.260> you<00:03:00.380> look<00:03:01.209> this<00:03:02.209> is<00:03:02.420> one<00:03:02.660> and<00:03:02.930> it<00:03:03.200> brings<00:03:03.920> a

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:04.100 
if you look this is one and it brings a

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:05.740 
if you look this is one and it brings a
signal<00:03:04.400> down<00:03:04.580> this<00:03:04.880> is<00:03:05.000> another<00:03:05.239> one<00:03:05.450> brings

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:05.750 
signal down this is another one brings

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:08.410 
signal down this is another one brings
Ingle<00:03:06.110> down<00:03:06.260> it's<00:03:06.440> exact<00:03:06.799> same<00:03:06.980> one<00:03:07.420> bringing

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:08.420 
Ingle down it's exact same one bringing

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:13.000 
Ingle down it's exact same one bringing
one<00:03:08.569> signal<00:03:09.080> out<00:03:09.489> so<00:03:11.110> here<00:03:12.110> are<00:03:12.350> our<00:03:12.380> valves

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010 
one signal out so here are our valves

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:14.740 
one signal out so here are our valves
symbolized<00:03:13.640> by<00:03:13.730> pistons<00:03:14.239> which<00:03:14.450> is<00:03:14.569> funny

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750 
symbolized by pistons which is funny

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:18.610 
symbolized by pistons which is funny
because<00:03:14.980> this<00:03:15.980> inside<00:03:16.310> the<00:03:16.430> actual<00:03:16.670> valves<00:03:17.620> or

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:18.620 
because this inside the actual valves or

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:20.940 
because this inside the actual valves or
what<00:03:18.829> I'm<00:03:19.100> trouble<00:03:20.000> about<00:03:20.120> are<00:03:20.299> made<00:03:20.420> by<00:03:20.570> I

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:20.950 
what I'm trouble about are made by I

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:27.819 
what I'm trouble about are made by I
inverted<00:03:21.950> the<00:03:22.130> signal<00:03:23.200> if<00:03:24.250> in<00:03:25.250> sorry<00:03:26.230> if<00:03:27.230> this

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:27.829 
inverted the signal if in sorry if this

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:30.910 
inverted the signal if in sorry if this
piston<00:03:28.609> if<00:03:28.820> the<00:03:29.180> that<00:03:29.600> valve<00:03:29.900> the<00:03:30.290> correlating

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:30.920 
piston if the that valve the correlating

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:35.410 
piston if the that valve the correlating
valve<00:03:31.160> was<00:03:31.760> up<00:03:31.970> so<00:03:32.930> all<00:03:33.350> the<00:03:33.709> top<00:03:33.859> row<00:03:34.100> is<00:03:34.420> third

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:35.420 
valve was up so all the top row is third

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:37.690 
valve was up so all the top row is third
valve<00:03:35.720> all<00:03:36.380> the<00:03:36.709> second<00:03:37.010> one<00:03:37.100> was<00:03:37.220> second

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:37.700 
valve all the second one was second

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:39.099 
valve all the second one was second
valve<00:03:37.850> and<00:03:38.060> all<00:03:38.120> the<00:03:38.180> first<00:03:38.359> Jose<00:03:38.510> Rafael<00:03:38.780> and

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:39.109 
valve and all the first Jose Rafael and

00:03:39.109 --> 00:03:42.849 
valve and all the first Jose Rafael and
so<00:03:40.100> if<00:03:40.310> this<00:03:41.090> was<00:03:41.329> up<00:03:41.600> if<00:03:42.109> the<00:03:42.290> first<00:03:42.500> valve<00:03:42.709> was

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:42.859 
so if this was up if the first valve was

00:03:42.859 --> 00:03:47.460 
so if this was up if the first valve was
up<00:03:43.010> I<00:03:43.480> would<00:03:44.480> invert<00:03:44.840> it<00:03:44.989> right<00:03:45.170> here<00:03:45.730> so<00:03:46.730> and

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:47.470 
up I would invert it right here so and

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:51.039 
up I would invert it right here so and
because<00:03:48.470> the<00:03:48.850> the<00:03:49.850> trumpet<00:03:50.540> is<00:03:50.660> pitched<00:03:50.870> in

00:03:51.039 --> 00:03:51.049 
because the the trumpet is pitched in

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:51.490 
because the the trumpet is pitched in
b-flat

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:51.500 
b-flat

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:54.400 
b-flat
when<00:03:52.400> the<00:03:52.489> trumpet<00:03:52.790> plays<00:03:53.030> AC<00:03:53.450> or<00:03:54.049> what<00:03:54.230> it

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:54.410 
when the trumpet plays AC or what it

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:56.620 
when the trumpet plays AC or what it
thinks<00:03:54.620> is<00:03:54.769> is<00:03:54.920> C<00:03:55.100> it's<00:03:55.970> really<00:03:56.180> a<00:03:56.209> concert

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:56.630 
thinks is is C it's really a concert

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:58.870 
thinks is is C it's really a concert
b-flat<00:03:57.019> so<00:03:57.650> if<00:03:57.769> I<00:03:57.890> were<00:03:58.040> to<00:03:58.069> play<00:03:58.250> a<00:03:58.280> G<00:03:58.609> on<00:03:58.640> the

00:03:58.870 --> 00:03:58.880 
b-flat so if I were to play a G on the

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:01.180 
b-flat so if I were to play a G on the
trumpet<00:03:59.150> I'd<00:03:59.870> really<00:04:00.140> be<00:04:00.260> playing<00:04:00.530> an<00:04:00.680> F<00:04:00.920> on

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:01.190 
trumpet I'd really be playing an F on

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:04.569 
trumpet I'd really be playing an F on
the<00:04:01.700> piano<00:04:02.650> so<00:04:03.650> I<00:04:03.859> have<00:04:04.010> to<00:04:04.100> tune<00:04:04.310> this<00:04:04.430> to

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:04.579 
the piano so I have to tune this to

00:04:04.579 --> 00:04:11.610 
the piano so I have to tune this to
concert<00:04:05.030> so<00:04:06.100> make<00:04:07.100> sure<00:04:07.160> my<00:04:07.400> sounds<00:04:07.670> are<00:04:09.160> the

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:11.620 
concert so make sure my sounds are the

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:14.410 
concert so make sure my sounds are the
blood<00:04:12.620> I<00:04:12.829> choose<00:04:13.430> chose<00:04:13.760> to<00:04:13.910> do<00:04:14.000> the<00:04:14.120> partial

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:14.420 
blood I choose chose to do the partial

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:17.860 
blood I choose chose to do the partial
in<00:04:15.049> the<00:04:15.350> staff<00:04:15.620> a<00:04:15.950> partial<00:04:16.579> in<00:04:16.639> the<00:04:16.729> staff<00:04:16.940> so

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:17.870 
in the staff a partial in the staff so

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:23.320 
in the staff a partial in the staff so
when<00:04:17.989> I<00:04:18.019> play<00:04:18.500> an<00:04:18.709> open<00:04:18.919> note<00:04:19.310> I<00:04:21.669> get<00:04:22.669> an<00:04:22.789> F

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:23.330 
when I play an open note I get an F

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:25.869 
when I play an open note I get an F
which<00:04:23.539> is<00:04:23.690> really<00:04:24.409> a<00:04:24.560> g2<00:04:24.949> the<00:04:24.979> trumpets<00:04:25.400> and

00:04:25.869 --> 00:04:25.879 
which is really a g2 the trumpets and

00:04:25.879 --> 00:04:28.779 
which is really a g2 the trumpets and
when<00:04:26.509> I<00:04:26.539> lower<00:04:26.780> note<00:04:27.250> you'll<00:04:28.250> hear<00:04:28.490> that<00:04:28.639> this

00:04:28.779 --> 00:04:28.789 
when I lower note you'll hear that this

00:04:28.789 --> 00:04:32.369 
when I lower note you'll hear that this
goes<00:04:29.000> down<00:04:29.150> chromatically<00:04:29.389> very<00:04:29.990> slightly

00:04:32.369 --> 00:04:32.379 

00:04:32.379 --> 00:04:36.670 

it<00:04:33.379> went<00:04:33.620> lowered<00:04:33.949> to<00:04:34.159> a<00:04:34.190> II<00:04:35.650> which<00:04:36.650> is

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:36.680 
it went lowered to a II which is

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:39.309 
it went lowered to a II which is
troubling<00:04:37.400> players<00:04:37.729> f-sharp<00:04:37.909> and<00:04:38.210> so<00:04:39.169> that

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:42.020 
works for every single one of them after

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:58.659 
works for every single one of them after
two<00:04:42.199> of<00:04:42.289> you<00:04:42.409> one<00:04:56.949> as<00:04:57.949> you<00:04:58.039> can<00:04:58.159> see<00:04:58.310> it<00:04:58.520> goes

00:04:58.659 --> 00:04:58.669 
two of you one as you can see it goes

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:00.879 
two of you one as you can see it goes
through<00:04:58.849> all<00:04:58.879> the<00:04:59.120> chromatic<00:04:59.479> notes<00:04:59.659> in<00:04:59.900> the

00:05:00.879 --> 00:05:00.889 
through all the chromatic notes in the

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:04.869 
through all the chromatic notes in the
order<00:05:01.310> that<00:05:02.770> they<00:05:03.770> would<00:05:04.159> appear<00:05:04.669> on<00:05:04.819> a

00:05:04.869 --> 00:05:04.879 
order that they would appear on a

00:05:04.879 --> 00:05:10.719 
order that they would appear on a
trumpet<00:05:06.430> so<00:05:07.719> yes<00:05:08.719> I'm<00:05:09.469> very<00:05:09.889> glad<00:05:10.340> I<00:05:10.430> was<00:05:10.639> able

00:05:10.719 --> 00:05:10.729 
trumpet so yes I'm very glad I was able

00:05:10.729 --> 00:05:14.860 
trumpet so yes I'm very glad I was able
to<00:05:10.879> slim<00:05:11.810> it<00:05:11.930> down<00:05:11.960> a<00:05:12.169> little<00:05:12.469> bit<00:05:13.090> to<00:05:14.090> from

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:14.870 
to slim it down a little bit to from

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:18.279 
to slim it down a little bit to from
here<00:05:16.210> to<00:05:17.210> here<00:05:17.509> making<00:05:17.990> it<00:05:18.110> much<00:05:18.229> more

00:05:18.279 --> 00:05:18.289 
here to here making it much more

00:05:18.289 --> 00:05:21.999 
here to here making it much more
organized<00:05:19.219> it's<00:05:19.520> much<00:05:20.270> better<00:05:20.509> design<00:05:20.900> and<00:05:21.889> on

00:05:21.999 --> 00:05:22.009 
organized it's much better design and on

00:05:22.009 --> 00:05:23.860 
organized it's much better design and on
I'm<00:05:22.250> actually<00:05:22.460> could<00:05:22.759> make<00:05:22.909> I<00:05:23.180> can't<00:05:23.569> really

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:23.870 
I'm actually could make I can't really

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:25.830 
I'm actually could make I can't really
make<00:05:23.990> it<00:05:24.050> to<00:05:24.319> much<00:05:24.620> more<00:05:24.770> compactness

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:25.840 
make it to much more compactness

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:29.260 
make it to much more compactness
well<00:05:26.840> I'm<00:05:26.960> sure<00:05:27.259> someone<00:05:27.800> with<00:05:28.009> a<00:05:28.340> good<00:05:29.000> amount

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:29.270 
well I'm sure someone with a good amount

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:30.700 
well I'm sure someone with a good amount
of<00:05:29.330> redstone<00:05:29.630> knowledge<00:05:30.080> I<00:05:30.199> know<00:05:30.259> very<00:05:30.529> little

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:30.710 
of redstone knowledge I know very little

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:32.700 
of redstone knowledge I know very little
about<00:05:30.830> redstone<00:05:31.310> and<00:05:31.940> this<00:05:32.120> is<00:05:32.240> actually<00:05:32.539> very

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:32.710 
about redstone and this is actually very

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:35.379 
about redstone and this is actually very
very<00:05:33.710> simple<00:05:34.310> redstone<00:05:34.490> it's<00:05:35.000> just<00:05:35.210> the

00:05:35.379 --> 00:05:35.389 
very simple redstone it's just the

00:05:35.389 --> 00:05:37.510 
very simple redstone it's just the
concept<00:05:35.900> of<00:05:35.990> the<00:05:36.139> trumpet<00:05:36.529> and<00:05:36.710> the<00:05:37.250> valves

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:37.520 
concept of the trumpet and the valves

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:42.059 
concept of the trumpet and the valves
moving<00:05:37.880> is<00:05:38.060> what<00:05:38.960> I<00:05:38.990> wanted<00:05:39.259> to<00:05:39.440> bring<00:05:39.590> to<00:05:40.580> this

00:05:42.059 --> 00:05:42.069 
moving is what I wanted to bring to this

00:05:42.069 --> 00:05:45.040 
moving is what I wanted to bring to this
