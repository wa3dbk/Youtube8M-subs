honestly<00:01:19.799> I<00:01:19.979> never<00:01:20.460> thought<00:01:20.759> it<00:01:20.880> would<00:01:20.939> say

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
honestly I never thought it would say

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.120 
honestly I never thought it would say
this<00:01:21.330> but<00:01:21.540> the<00:01:22.080> amount<00:01:22.409> of<00:01:22.470> wars<00:01:22.710> that<00:01:22.890> you<00:01:22.979> get

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
this but the amount of wars that you get

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.980 
this but the amount of wars that you get
from<00:01:23.159> this<00:01:23.400> trinket<00:01:23.670> is<00:01:23.939> honestly<00:01:24.450> enough<00:01:24.810> to

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
from this trinket is honestly enough to

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.450 
from this trinket is honestly enough to
where<00:01:25.140> you<00:01:25.229> probably<00:01:25.619> don't<00:01:25.920> have<00:01:26.009> to<00:01:26.280> buy

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
where you probably don't have to buy

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.490 
where you probably don't have to buy
additional<00:01:26.880> wards<00:01:27.450> with<00:01:27.930> of<00:01:28.080> course<00:01:28.320> the

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
additional wards with of course the

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.060 
additional wards with of course the

exception of pink's now between the two

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.440 
exception of pink's now between the two
I<00:01:32.100> would<00:01:32.400> definitely<00:01:32.579> say<00:01:32.820> that<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.180> greater

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
I would definitely say that the greater

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.020 
I would definitely say that the greater
stealth<00:01:33.900> totem<00:01:34.320> is<00:01:34.470> reasonably<00:01:35.220> more<00:01:35.549> useful

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
stealth totem is reasonably more useful

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.300 
stealth totem is reasonably more useful
than<00:01:36.060> the<00:01:36.360> greater<00:01:36.720> vision<00:01:37.079> totem<00:01:37.590> but<00:01:38.070> either

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
than the greater vision totem but either

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.249 
than the greater vision totem but either
way<00:01:38.610> the<00:01:38.909> greater<00:01:39.150> vision<00:01:39.390> totem<00:01:39.869> gives<00:01:40.110> you<00:01:40.229> a

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
way the greater vision totem gives you a

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.530 
way the greater vision totem gives you a
full-blown<00:01:41.100> pink<00:01:41.520> ward<00:01:41.790> on<00:01:41.970> a<00:01:42.030> two<00:01:42.180> minute

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
full-blown pink ward on a two minute

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.840 
full-blown pink ward on a two minute
cooldown<00:01:42.869> now<00:01:43.860> I<00:01:43.890> would<00:01:44.100> definitely

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
cooldown now I would definitely

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.700 
cooldown now I would definitely
recommend<00:01:45.149> getting<00:01:45.780> the<00:01:46.049> greater<00:01:46.320> stealth

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
recommend getting the greater stealth
