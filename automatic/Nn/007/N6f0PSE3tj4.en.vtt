gameplay<00:01:30.680> in<00:01:31.680> my<00:01:31.860> opinion<00:01:32.130> good<00:01:32.490> challenging

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
gameplay in my opinion good challenging

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.420 
gameplay in my opinion good challenging
gameplay<00:01:33.150> relies<00:01:33.689> on<00:01:33.720> player<00:01:34.320> skill<00:01:34.799> and

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
gameplay relies on player skill and

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:36.920 
gameplay relies on player skill and
there<00:01:35.579> shouldn't<00:01:35.790> be<00:01:35.880> random<00:01:36.420> elements

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
there shouldn't be random elements

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
outside of the player control that

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.160 
outside of the player control that

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
dictates whether the player succeeds or

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.499 
dictates whether the player succeeds or
fails<00:01:40.229> and<00:01:40.799> this<00:01:41.579> is<00:01:41.759> the<00:01:41.909> real<00:01:42.060> issue<00:01:42.329> that<00:01:42.479> I

fails and this is the real issue that I

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.300 
fails and this is the real issue that I
see<00:01:42.750> with<00:01:42.869> Diablo<00:01:43.320> 3's<00:01:43.590> gameplay<00:01:43.979> right<00:01:44.159> now

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
see with Diablo 3's gameplay right now

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.880 
see with Diablo 3's gameplay right now
there<00:01:44.850> is<00:01:45.060> too<00:01:45.390> much<00:01:45.540> randomness<00:01:46.079> and<00:01:46.409> too

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
there is too much randomness and too

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
gameplay aspects of Diablo if you look

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.040 
gameplay aspects of Diablo if you look
at<00:02:44.430> the<00:02:44.520> boss<00:02:44.670> fights<00:02:45.030> I<00:02:45.300> think<00:02:45.780> the<00:02:45.870> boss

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
at the boss fights I think the boss

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:47.960 
at the boss fights I think the boss
fights<00:02:46.350> are<00:02:46.500> great<00:02:46.769> they're<00:02:47.280> a<00:02:47.310> great<00:02:47.610> example

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
fights are great they're a great example

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.330 
fights are great they're a great example
of<00:02:48.360> internal<00:02:48.989> locus<00:02:49.140> of<00:02:49.380> control<00:02:49.440> they're<00:02:50.310> a

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.570 
of internal locus of control they're a
great<00:02:50.610> example<00:02:51.060> of<00:02:51.420> a<00:02:51.540> challenging<00:02:52.170> gameplay

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:52.580 
great example of a challenging gameplay

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:55.670 
great example of a challenging gameplay
without<00:02:53.580> being<00:02:53.910> frustrating<00:02:54.630> now<00:02:55.530> my

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.270 
favorite example is the Belial fight
it's<00:02:57.720> a<00:02:57.810> really<00:02:58.050> difficult<00:02:58.290> encounter<00:02:59.069> and

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
survive it but with that said you can

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.370

reason you're getting one shot because

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.410 
reason you're getting one shot because

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
you stood in the fire in the fireball or

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.180 
you stood in the fire in the fireball or
you<00:03:18.690> stood<00:03:18.900> in<00:03:18.959> the<00:03:19.079> path<00:03:19.320> of<00:03:19.500> this<00:03:19.620> big<00:03:19.860> attack

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
you stood in the path of this big attack

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:21.949 
you stood in the path of this big attack
and<00:03:20.459> then<00:03:20.850> when<00:03:21.030> you<00:03:21.150> die<00:03:21.329> you<00:03:21.390> learn<00:03:21.750> from

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
and then when you die you learn from

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:23.990 
and then when you die you learn from
that<00:03:22.140> so<00:03:22.380> it's<00:03:22.890> a<00:03:22.980> challenge<00:03:23.010> and<00:03:23.670> it's<00:03:23.850> not

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
frustrating because you understand that

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:28.220

fire<00:04:14.730> so<00:04:15.450> I<00:04:15.480> think<00:04:15.600> the<00:04:15.810> gameplay<00:04:16.169> could<00:04:16.380> be

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 
fire so I think the gameplay could be

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.529 
fire so I think the gameplay could be
improved<00:04:16.680> dramatically<00:04:17.280> if<00:04:17.579> blizzard<00:04:18.090> made
