00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:02.040 
hey everyone today I'm going to show you

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.269 
hey everyone today I'm going to show you
briefly<00:00:02.850> the<00:00:03.330> skewed<00:00:03.629> ovation<00:00:04.020> for<00:00:04.470> the<00:00:04.859> WCA

00:00:05.269 --> 00:00:05.279 
briefly the skewed ovation for the WCA

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:08.150 
briefly the skewed ovation for the WCA
for<00:00:05.579> next<00:00:05.879> year<00:00:06.149> so<00:00:06.809> next<00:00:06.959> year<00:00:07.139> 2014's<00:00:07.769> cube

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.160 
for next year so next year 2014's cube

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:09.890 
for next year so next year 2014's cube
will<00:00:08.280> be<00:00:08.309> an<00:00:08.429> official<00:00:08.580> event<00:00:08.849> and<00:00:09.240> of<00:00:09.629> course

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
will be an official event and of course

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.600 
will be an official event and of course
the<00:00:10.200> regulations<00:00:10.740> have<00:00:10.980> to<00:00:11.040> accommodate<00:00:11.580> for

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
the regulations have to accommodate for

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:12.020 
the regulations have to accommodate for
it

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
it

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.449 
it
so<00:00:12.480> the<00:00:12.990> wording<00:00:13.379> in<00:00:13.530> the<00:00:13.620> regulations<00:00:14.129> for

00:00:14.449 --> 00:00:14.459 
so the wording in the regulations for

00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:16.490 
so the wording in the regulations for
how<00:00:14.669> to<00:00:14.730> scramble<00:00:15.150> first<00:00:15.419> cube<00:00:15.660> might<00:00:16.349> be

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
how to scramble first cube might be

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.920 
how to scramble first cube might be
tough<00:00:16.710> to<00:00:16.740> understand<00:00:17.310> I<00:00:17.609> think<00:00:18.060> that<00:00:18.689> Sarah

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
tough to understand I think that Sarah

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.179 
tough to understand I think that Sarah
did<00:00:19.080> a<00:00:19.109> really<00:00:19.230> good<00:00:19.380> job<00:00:19.439> at<00:00:19.740> relaying<00:00:20.010> the

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
did a really good job at relaying the

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.630 
did a really good job at relaying the
concepts<00:00:20.840> of<00:00:21.840> this<00:00:22.320> the<00:00:22.890> notation<00:00:23.429> that<00:00:23.550> we're

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
concepts of this the notation that we're

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.370 
concepts of this the notation that we're
going<00:00:23.730> to<00:00:23.789> be<00:00:23.910> using<00:00:24.240> because<00:00:24.900> the<00:00:25.019> concepts

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
going to be using because the concepts

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.130 
going to be using because the concepts
are<00:00:25.529> really<00:00:25.800> difficult<00:00:26.070> to<00:00:26.460> to<00:00:27.269> describe<00:00:27.660> and

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
are really difficult to to describe and

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.990 
are really difficult to to describe and
doing<00:00:28.740> it<00:00:28.830> in<00:00:28.920> the<00:00:28.980> way<00:00:29.070> she<00:00:29.250> did<00:00:29.429> is<00:00:29.609> very

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
doing it in the way she did is very

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.240 
doing it in the way she did is very
admirable<00:00:30.509> but<00:00:31.470> it<00:00:31.619> can<00:00:31.800> still<00:00:32.099> really

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
admirable but it can still really

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:33.650 
admirable but it can still really
confuse<00:00:32.670> people<00:00:32.820> and<00:00:33.090> I<00:00:33.120> have<00:00:33.210> people<00:00:33.450> saying

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
confuse people and I have people saying

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.890 
confuse people and I have people saying
what<00:00:33.900> is<00:00:34.110> this<00:00:34.380> so<00:00:35.100> here<00:00:35.760> we<00:00:35.880> go<00:00:36.030> so<00:00:36.630> I'm<00:00:36.720> going

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:36.900 
what is this so here we go so I'm going

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:38.360 
what is this so here we go so I'm going
to<00:00:37.110> assume<00:00:37.350> you<00:00:37.560> already<00:00:37.680> know<00:00:37.860> how<00:00:37.980> this<00:00:38.010> cube

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
to assume you already know how this cube

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.940 
to assume you already know how this cube
turns<00:00:38.640> basically<00:00:39.240> you<00:00:39.360> take<00:00:39.510> three<00:00:40.440> adjacent

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
turns basically you take three adjacent

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.530 
turns basically you take three adjacent
centers<00:00:41.460> put<00:00:41.700> your<00:00:41.790> fingers<00:00:42.060> on<00:00:42.180> them<00:00:42.330> and

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
centers put your fingers on them and

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.800 
centers put your fingers on them and
twist<00:00:42.900> in<00:00:43.260> either<00:00:43.410> direction<00:00:43.650> and<00:00:44.570> all<00:00:45.570> the

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:45.810 
twist in either direction and all the

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:48.710 
twist in either direction and all the
turns<00:00:46.080> of<00:00:46.380> the<00:00:46.860> layers<00:00:47.070> go<00:00:47.460> about<00:00:47.850> one<00:00:48.270> corner

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:48.720 
turns of the layers go about one corner

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.080 
turns of the layers go about one corner
so<00:00:48.900> you<00:00:48.930> see<00:00:49.140> this<00:00:49.290> corner<00:00:49.560> just<00:00:49.850> rotates<00:00:50.850> in

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
so you see this corner just rotates in

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.140 
so you see this corner just rotates in
place<00:00:51.390> while<00:00:52.010> everything<00:00:53.010> else<00:00:53.150> shifts

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:54.150 
place while everything else shifts

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:57.470 
place while everything else shifts
around<00:00:55.040> so<00:00:56.040> with<00:00:56.280> this<00:00:56.370> said<00:00:56.640> I'm<00:00:57.150> gonna<00:00:57.330> let

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
around so with this said I'm gonna let

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:58.550 
around so with this said I'm gonna let
you<00:00:57.540> know<00:00:57.630> that<00:00:57.750> there<00:00:57.870> are<00:00:57.930> four<00:00:58.230> letters

00:00:58.550 --> 00:00:58.560 
you know that there are four letters

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:03.200 
you know that there are four letters
that<00:00:59.010> we're<00:00:59.100> going<00:00:59.190> to<00:00:59.280> use<00:00:59.460> R<00:00:59.870> u<00:01:00.870> L<00:01:01.350> and<00:01:01.800> B<00:01:02.210> are

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
that we're going to use R u L and B are

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.020 
that we're going to use R u L and B are
ul<00:01:03.630> and<00:01:03.810> B<00:01:03.930> are<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:04.619> same<00:01:04.829> letters<00:01:05.489> as<00:01:05.609> we<00:01:05.909> use

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
ul and B are the same letters as we use

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.580 
ul and B are the same letters as we use
for<00:01:06.240> pyraminx<00:01:06.630> so<00:01:06.960> it<00:01:07.109> should<00:01:07.259> be<00:01:07.289> a<00:01:07.409> little

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
for pyraminx so it should be a little

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.359 
for pyraminx so it should be a little
bit<00:01:08.359> analogous<00:01:09.359> I<00:01:09.750> suppose<00:01:10.200> you<00:01:10.350> could<00:01:10.469> say<00:01:10.619> so

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
bit analogous I suppose you could say so

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.550 
bit analogous I suppose you could say so
here's<00:01:11.939> your<00:01:12.030> Scoob<00:01:12.359> and<00:01:12.600> our<00:01:12.840> move<00:01:13.109> would<00:01:13.409> be

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
here's your Scoob and our move would be

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.499 
here's your Scoob and our move would be
a<00:01:13.770> clockwise<00:01:14.520> turn<00:01:14.789> of<00:01:15.090> the<00:01:15.329> layer

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
a clockwise turn of the layer

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.080 
a clockwise turn of the layer
surrounding<00:01:15.920> this<00:01:16.920> corner<00:01:17.520> in<00:01:17.670> the

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
surrounding this corner in the

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.349 
surrounding this corner in the
regulations<00:01:18.600> it's<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:19.100> lower<00:01:20.100> right<00:01:20.700> visible

00:01:21.349 --> 00:01:21.359 
regulations it's the lower right visible

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:26.480 
regulations it's the lower right visible
vertex<00:01:23.090> so<00:01:24.090> that<00:01:24.240> would<00:01:24.450> be<00:01:24.600> our<00:01:25.130> so<00:01:26.130> turning

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
vertex so that would be our so turning

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.239 
vertex so that would be our so turning
the<00:01:26.640> layer<00:01:26.789> around<00:01:26.999> this<00:01:27.420> corner<00:01:27.960> and<00:01:28.249> then

00:01:29.239 --> 00:01:29.249 
the layer around this corner and then

00:01:29.249 --> 00:01:31.639 
the layer around this corner and then
our<00:01:29.429> prime<00:01:29.759> would<00:01:30.390> be<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:30.749> inverse<00:01:31.020> so<00:01:31.590> you

00:01:31.639 --> 00:01:31.649 
our prime would be the inverse so you

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:36.050 
our prime would be the inverse so you
just<00:01:32.009> turn<00:01:32.219> it<00:01:32.249> back<00:01:33.679> you<00:01:34.679> would<00:01:35.130> be<00:01:35.280> a<00:01:35.490> turn<00:01:35.850> of

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
just turn it back you would be a turn of

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.569 
just turn it back you would be a turn of
the<00:01:36.899> layer<00:01:37.079> around<00:01:37.499> this<00:01:37.770> corner<00:01:38.159> up<00:01:38.280> here<00:01:38.310> the

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
the layer around this corner up here the

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.059 
the layer around this corner up here the
upper<00:01:38.880> most<00:01:39.030> visible<00:01:39.479> corner<00:01:39.749> and<00:01:40.350> I'd<00:01:40.950> be

00:01:41.059 --> 00:01:41.069 
upper most visible corner and I'd be

00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:44.300 
upper most visible corner and I'd be
like<00:01:41.219> this<00:01:41.869> u<00:01:42.869> prime<00:01:42.899> similarly<00:01:43.889> would<00:01:44.130> be

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
like this u prime similarly would be

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.620 
like this u prime similarly would be
that<00:01:44.880> same<00:01:45.119> thing<00:01:45.329> inverted<00:01:46.639> L<00:01:47.639> is<00:01:48.060> easy<00:01:48.299> it's

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
that same thing inverted L is easy it's

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.669 
that same thing inverted L is easy it's
down<00:01:49.139> here<00:01:49.439> a<00:01:49.619> clockwise<00:01:50.490> turn<00:01:50.789> of<00:01:50.999> the<00:01:51.179> layer

00:01:51.669 --> 00:01:51.679 
down here a clockwise turn of the layer

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:54.620 
down here a clockwise turn of the layer
surrounding<00:01:52.679> the<00:01:53.189> lower<00:01:53.490> left<00:01:53.819> most<00:01:54.179> visible

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
surrounding the lower left most visible

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.410 
surrounding the lower left most visible
vertex<00:01:55.020> which<00:01:55.380> would<00:01:55.499> be<00:01:55.619> that<00:01:56.459> clockwise

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
vertex which would be that clockwise

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.969 
vertex which would be that clockwise
yeah<00:01:57.780> and<00:01:58.469> then<00:01:58.649> al<00:01:58.859> prime<00:01:59.249> would<00:01:59.520> be<00:01:59.600> back<00:02:00.979> now

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
yeah and then al prime would be back now

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:05.090 
yeah and then al prime would be back now
a<00:02:02.310> B<00:02:03.090> move<00:02:03.329> is<00:02:03.630> a<00:02:04.170> clockwise<00:02:04.499> turn<00:02:04.859> of<00:02:05.039> the

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
a B move is a clockwise turn of the

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.660 
a B move is a clockwise turn of the
layer<00:02:05.280> surrounding<00:02:05.810> the<00:02:06.859> back<00:02:07.859> most<00:02:08.160> non

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
layer surrounding the back most non

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.490 
layer surrounding the back most non
visible<00:02:08.940> vertex<00:02:09.540> so<00:02:09.810> you<00:02:09.900> can<00:02:10.050> see<00:02:10.229> seven

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
visible vertex so you can see seven

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.770 
visible vertex so you can see seven
vertices<00:02:10.890> here<00:02:11.160> yeah<00:02:11.820> the<00:02:12.360> six<00:02:12.600> on<00:02:12.720> the

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
vertices here yeah the six on the

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.970 
vertices here yeah the six on the
outside<00:02:13.140> this<00:02:13.290> one<00:02:13.440> in<00:02:13.560> front

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
outside this one in front

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.760 
outside this one in front
now<00:02:14.370> the<00:02:14.430> eighth<00:02:14.640> vertex<00:02:15.180> or<00:02:15.360> corner<00:02:15.900> is<00:02:16.050> stuck

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
now the eighth vertex or corner is stuck

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:18.949 
now the eighth vertex or corner is stuck
here<00:02:17.069> in<00:02:17.280> the<00:02:17.459> back<00:02:17.610> that<00:02:18.269> was<00:02:18.390> invisible

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
here in the back that was invisible

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:19.820 
here in the back that was invisible
until<00:02:19.260> just<00:02:19.470> now

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
until just now

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.250 
until just now
so<00:02:20.610> we're<00:02:21.360> going<00:02:21.450> to<00:02:21.510> turn<00:02:21.780> the<00:02:22.019> layer

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
so we're going to turn the layer

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.089 
so we're going to turn the layer
surrounding<00:02:22.560> that<00:02:22.769> clockwise<00:02:24.800> and<00:02:25.800> that's

00:02:26.089 --> 00:02:26.099 
surrounding that clockwise and that's

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:29.150 
surrounding that clockwise and that's
that<00:02:26.430> and<00:02:26.700> b-prime<00:02:27.150> would<00:02:27.660> be<00:02:27.890> the<00:02:28.890> inverse

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
that and b-prime would be the inverse

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.949 
that and b-prime would be the inverse
from<00:02:29.790> the<00:02:29.910> side<00:02:30.150> B<00:02:30.540> looks<00:02:30.780> like<00:02:30.930> this<00:02:31.140> and<00:02:31.610> this

00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:32.959 
from the side B looks like this and this

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:35.420 
from the side B looks like this and this
so<00:02:33.959> that's<00:02:34.110> very<00:02:34.230> simple<00:02:34.620> so<00:02:34.769> it's<00:02:34.980> told<00:02:35.370> you

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
so that's very simple so it's told you

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:42.039 
so that's very simple so it's told you
to<00:02:35.550> do<00:02:36.500> u<00:02:37.500> prime<00:02:37.890> L<00:02:38.280> u<00:02:38.849> R<00:02:39.239> prime<00:02:39.540> u<00:02:39.989> du<00:02:40.200> u<00:02:40.410> prime<00:02:40.950> L

00:02:42.039 --> 00:02:42.049 
to do u prime L u R prime u du u prime L

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:48.170 
to do u prime L u R prime u du u prime L
u<00:02:43.049> R<00:02:43.830> Prime<00:02:44.599> simple<00:02:45.599> enough<00:02:45.810> yeah<00:02:46.489> so<00:02:47.489> hope

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
u R Prime simple enough yeah so hope

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:49.940 
u R Prime simple enough yeah so hope
this<00:02:48.360> helps<00:02:48.750> I<00:02:48.900> hope<00:02:49.140> this<00:02:49.260> clarifies<00:02:49.470> a<00:02:49.709> lot

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
this helps I hope this clarifies a lot

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:55.280 
this helps I hope this clarifies a lot
of<00:02:50.069> things<00:02:50.280> and<00:02:51.349> happy<00:02:52.349> scheming<00:02:52.739> bye
