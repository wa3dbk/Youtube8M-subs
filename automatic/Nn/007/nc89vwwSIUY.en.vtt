what one of the website said for all of
it<00:01:02.579> you<00:01:02.820> know<00:01:02.940> but<00:01:03.510> it's<00:01:03.690> broken<00:01:04.049> down<00:01:04.260> over

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
it you know but it's broken down over

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.399 
it you know but it's broken down over
three<00:01:04.769> months<00:01:04.979> I<00:01:05.489> don't<00:01:06.240> have<00:01:06.689> the<00:01:06.840> coffee<00:01:07.080> or

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:10.580 
the cups yet a little embarrassing for

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:13.670 
the cups yet a little embarrassing for
some<00:01:11.580> reason<00:01:12.119> they<00:01:12.780> will<00:01:13.080> be<00:01:13.229> arriving

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
some reason they will be arriving

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.499 
some reason they will be arriving
tomorrow<00:01:13.710> I<00:01:14.640> don't<00:01:15.180> know<00:01:15.270> how<00:01:15.390> that's

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
tomorrow I don't know how that's

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.899 
tomorrow I don't know how that's
possible<00:01:15.740> they<00:01:16.740> were<00:01:16.799> ordered<00:01:17.250> at<00:01:17.430> the<00:01:17.549> exact

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
possible they were ordered at the exact

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.420 
possible they were ordered at the exact
they<00:01:18.119> were<00:01:18.240> paid<00:01:18.540> for<00:01:18.570> at<00:01:18.869> the<00:01:18.960> same<00:01:18.990> time<00:01:19.439> same

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
they were paid for at the same time same

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.899 
they were paid for at the same time same
order<00:01:20.759> whatever<00:01:21.360> so<00:01:22.080> tomorrow<00:01:22.610> I'll<00:01:23.610> probably

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
order whatever so tomorrow I'll probably

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.550 
order whatever so tomorrow I'll probably
be<00:01:24.299> in<00:01:24.330> a<00:01:24.570> different<00:01:24.900> outfit<00:01:25.340> hopefully<00:01:26.340> and

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:27.560 
be in a different outfit hopefully and

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.850 
be in a different outfit hopefully and
so<00:01:28.560> I<00:01:29.600> clearly<00:01:30.600> changed<00:01:31.259> that<00:01:31.439> must<00:01:31.650> mean<00:01:31.799> it's

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
so I clearly changed that must mean it's

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.620
