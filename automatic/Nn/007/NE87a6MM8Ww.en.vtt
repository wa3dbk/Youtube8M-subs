00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
silicon head up to the front of the bait

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.789 
silicon head up to the front of the bait
towards<00:01:27.299> the<00:01:27.479> eye<00:01:27.509> where<00:01:28.049> you<00:01:28.170> attach<00:01:28.530> your

fish<00:01:37.070> now<00:01:38.070> what<00:01:38.250> we've<00:01:38.400> done<00:01:38.430> to<00:01:38.759> make<00:01:38.790> this

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
fish now what we've done to make this

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.569 
fish now what we've done to make this
bait<00:01:39.329> run<00:01:39.600> even<00:01:39.840> better<00:01:40.170> is<00:01:40.680> we've<00:01:40.950> added<00:01:41.220> a

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
bait run even better is we've added a

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.670 
bait run even better is we've added a
small<00:01:41.820> weight<00:01:42.240> at<00:01:42.509> the<00:01:42.570> bottom<00:01:42.659> to<00:01:43.350> Keele

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
small weight at the bottom to Keele

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.429 
small weight at the bottom to Keele
balance<00:01:44.220> it<00:01:44.399> so<00:01:44.549> it<00:01:44.880> runs<00:01:45.119> upright<00:01:45.689> every<00:01:46.200> time

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
balance it so it runs upright every time

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.340 
balance it so it runs upright every time
we've<00:01:47.310> also<00:01:47.729> matched<00:01:48.360> the<00:01:48.600> colors<00:01:49.020> of<00:01:49.229> the

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
we've also matched the colors of the

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.190 
we've also matched the colors of the
silicone<00:01:49.860> head<00:01:50.220> the<00:01:51.030> spinner<00:01:51.360> bait<00:01:51.630> head<00:01:51.930> and

silicone head the spinner bait head and

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.280 
silicone head the spinner bait head and
the<00:01:53.009> blades<00:01:53.340> to<00:01:53.729> create<00:01:54.420> a<00:01:54.450> really<00:01:55.020> natural

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
the blades to create a really natural

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.740 
the blades to create a really natural
and<00:01:55.799> lifelike<00:01:56.310> appearance<00:01:56.520> now<00:01:57.420> the<00:01:57.479> great

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
and lifelike appearance now the great

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.359

thing<00:01:57.990> about<00:01:58.079> this<00:01:58.469> bait<00:01:58.740> is<00:01:58.979> it<00:01:59.130> doesn't

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
thing about this bait is it doesn't

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.480 
thing about this bait is it doesn't
weigh<00:01:59.700> a<00:01:59.729> whole<00:02:00.030> lot<00:02:00.270> the<00:02:01.079> head<00:02:01.290> itself<00:02:01.740> is<00:02:02.070> 3/8

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
weigh a whole lot the head itself is 3/8

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.069 
weigh a whole lot the head itself is 3/8
of<00:02:02.640> an<00:02:02.759> ounce<00:02:02.909> the<00:02:03.270> whole<00:02:03.509> rig<00:02:03.810> together

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
of an ounce the whole rig together

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:07.459 
of an ounce the whole rig together
weighs<00:02:05.070> less<00:02:05.460> than<00:02:05.520> 3/4<00:02:06.360> of<00:02:06.390> an<00:02:06.600> ounce<00:02:06.750> so<00:02:07.079> you

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
weighs less than 3/4 of an ounce so you

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.650 
weighs less than 3/4 of an ounce so you
can<00:02:07.619> throw<00:02:07.890> it<00:02:07.979> on<00:02:08.039> any<00:02:08.280> kind<00:02:08.550> of<00:02:08.729> tackle<00:02:09.179> you
