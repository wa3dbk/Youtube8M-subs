is<00:00:17.400> thus<00:00:17.670> crystal<00:00:18.180> scavenger<00:00:18.810> it<00:00:18.990> was

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
is thus crystal scavenger it was

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:25.310 
is thus crystal scavenger it was
actually<00:00:19.859> made<00:00:20.480> days<00:00:21.529> weeks<00:00:22.529> ago<00:00:22.830> and<00:00:23.930> I<00:00:24.930> think

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:44.229 
thing is so we have here the meepo set

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:46.560 
thing is so we have here the meepo set
and<00:01:44.560> we're<00:01:44.890> going<00:01:45.009> to<00:01:45.070> be<00:01:45.159> getting<00:01:45.399> first<00:01:45.820> some

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:46.570 
and we're going to be getting first some

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:49.659 
items for us to be faster so we have

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:59.149 
items for us to be faster so we have
here<00:01:51.299> let's<00:01:52.299> see<00:01:52.619> let's<00:01:53.619> go<00:01:53.830> first<00:01:54.130> and<00:01:54.369> watch
