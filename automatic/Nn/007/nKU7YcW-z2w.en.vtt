00:01:21.179 --> 00:01:21.189 
takes quite a few turns to actually get

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:25.489 
takes quite a few turns to actually get
the<00:01:21.369> spool<00:01:21.700> all<00:01:22.509> the<00:01:23.049> way<00:01:23.200> up<00:01:24.090> there<00:01:25.090> you<00:01:25.149> go

00:01:25.489 --> 00:01:25.499 
the spool all the way up there you go

00:01:25.499 --> 00:01:30.529 
the spool all the way up there you go
all<00:01:26.499> the<00:01:26.560> way<00:01:26.740> up<00:01:27.100> to<00:01:27.819> the<00:01:28.509> top<00:01:28.810> of<00:01:29.049> its<00:01:29.229> range

00:01:30.529 --> 00:01:30.539 
all the way up to the top of its range

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:36.989 
all the way up to the top of its range
and<00:01:32.159> same<00:01:33.159> again<00:01:33.340> on<00:01:33.670> the<00:01:33.789> way<00:01:33.909> down<00:01:35.729> there<00:01:36.729> we

00:01:36.989 --> 00:01:36.999 
and same again on the way down there we

00:01:36.999 --> 00:01:39.840 
and same again on the way down there we
go<00:01:37.179> just<00:01:37.600> at<00:01:37.780> the<00:01:37.869> bottom<00:01:38.200> now<00:01:38.490> so<00:01:39.490> as<00:01:39.579> you<00:01:39.729> can

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:39.850 
go just at the bottom now so as you can

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:41.639 
go just at the bottom now so as you can
see<00:01:40.060> it's<00:01:40.240> actually<00:01:40.569> quite<00:01:40.749> a<00:01:40.810> few<00:01:41.020> turns<00:01:41.289> of

00:01:41.639 --> 00:01:41.649 
see it's actually quite a few turns of

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:44.399 
see it's actually quite a few turns of
the<00:01:41.770> reel<00:01:42.060> before<00:01:43.060> the<00:01:43.389> spool<00:01:43.630> hits<00:01:43.899> its<00:01:44.139> top

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:44.409 
the reel before the spool hits its top

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:46.679 
the reel before the spool hits its top
limit<00:01:44.649> and<00:01:44.889> bottom<00:01:45.249> limit<00:01:45.460> and<00:01:45.759> that<00:01:46.389> then

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:46.689 
limit and bottom limit and that then

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:52.309 
limit and bottom limit and that then
gives<00:01:47.049> you<00:01:47.350> a<00:01:47.560> very<00:01:48.280> very<00:01:49.469> neat<00:01:50.700> tidy<00:01:51.700> and

00:01:52.309 --> 00:01:52.319

00:01:56.879 --> 00:01:56.889 
superb line light which obviously helps

00:01:56.889 --> 00:01:59.749 
superb line light which obviously helps
with<00:01:57.189> the<00:01:57.280> casting<00:01:57.819> it's<00:01:58.600> also<00:01:58.810> got<00:01:59.380> a

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
with the casting it's also got a

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:04.050 
with the casting it's also got a

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.060 
distance spool which as you can see has

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:06.149 
distance spool which as you can see has

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.270 

a<00:02:14.580> high<00:02:15.580> quality<00:02:15.940> aluminium<00:02:16.710> so<00:02:17.710> it's<00:02:17.890> very

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
a high quality aluminium so it's very

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.080 
a high quality aluminium so it's very
very<00:02:18.670> light<00:02:19.050> but<00:02:20.050> tough<00:02:20.590> as<00:02:20.800> well<00:02:21.090> obviously

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
very light but tough as well obviously

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.000 
very light but tough as well obviously
and<00:02:22.300> they<00:02:22.690> come<00:02:22.930> with<00:02:23.080> a<00:02:23.110> second<00:02:23.530> one<00:02:23.710> of<00:02:23.830> those

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
and they come with a second one of those

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.100 
and they come with a second one of those
as<00:02:24.280> well<00:02:24.490> so<00:02:25.060> you<00:02:25.150> don't<00:02:25.210> have<00:02:25.390> to<00:02:25.600> fork<00:02:25.900> out<00:02:26.050> a

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
as well so you don't have to fork out a

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:30.950 
as well so you don't have to fork out a
fortune<00:02:26.710> for<00:02:27.580> a<00:02:27.670> second<00:02:28.330> spool<00:02:28.600> all<00:02:29.410> in<00:02:29.650> all
