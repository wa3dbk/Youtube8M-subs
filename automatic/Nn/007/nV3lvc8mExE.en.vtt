graveyard which I think this effects
kind<00:01:44.040> of<00:01:44.220> limited<00:01:44.549> but<00:01:45.060> we'll<00:01:45.210> get<00:01:45.299> to<00:01:45.360> that

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
kind of limited but we'll get to that

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:46.999 
kind of limited but we'll get to that
really<00:01:45.930> my<00:01:46.049> only<00:01:46.229> complaint<00:01:46.649> for<00:01:46.770> this<00:01:46.860> card

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
really my only complaint for this card

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.380 
really my only complaint for this card
as<00:01:47.130> it<00:01:47.220> seems<00:01:47.430> a<00:01:47.549> little<00:01:47.700> bit<00:01:47.909> difficult<00:01:48.119> to

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
as it seems a little bit difficult to

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.960 
as it seems a little bit difficult to
summon<00:01:48.780> one<00:01:49.259> Tuner<00:01:49.290> and<00:01:49.829> one<00:01:50.070> dark<00:01:50.460> dragon

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
summon one Tuner and one dark dragon

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.080 
summon one Tuner and one dark dragon
type<00:01:51.180> non-tuner<00:01:51.869> synchro<00:01:52.350> monster<00:01:52.799> that's<00:01:53.790> so

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
type non-tuner synchro monster that's so

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.569 
type non-tuner synchro monster that's so
specific<00:01:54.420> and<00:01:54.930> it's<00:01:55.170> so<00:01:55.439> awkward<00:01:55.710> to<00:01:55.979> summon<00:01:56.369> 2

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
specific and it's so awkward to summon 2

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:57.859 
specific and it's so awkward to summon 2
I<00:01:56.820> mean<00:01:57.030> obviously<00:01:57.450> you're<00:01:57.570> gonna<00:01:57.719> have

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
I mean obviously you're gonna have

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.450 
I mean obviously you're gonna have
pretty<00:01:58.110> much<00:01:58.170> a<00:01:58.320> plethora<00:01:58.770> of<00:01:58.799> tuners<00:01:59.159> in<00:01:59.219> your

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
pretty much a plethora of tuners in your

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:00.859 
pretty much a plethora of tuners in your
graveyard<00:01:59.610> to<00:01:59.880> use<00:02:00.000> with<00:02:00.149> the<00:02:00.270> second<00:02:00.630> effect

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
graveyard to use with the second effect

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.330 
graveyard to use with the second effect
because<00:02:01.229> you<00:02:01.320> have<00:02:01.560> to<00:02:01.799> sink<00:02:02.009> or<00:02:02.070> something

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
you have to use a tuner to summon this

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.170 
you have to use a tuner to summon this
thing<00:02:03.869> but<00:02:04.530> you<00:02:05.130> really<00:02:05.340> you<00:02:05.700> want<00:02:06.000> to<00:02:06.090> be

after<00:02:12.629> using<00:02:12.810> its<00:02:13.050> effect<00:02:13.379> to<00:02:13.500> make<00:02:13.650> allele<00:02:13.920> or

00:02:14.149 --> 00:02:14.159 
after using its effect to make allele or

00:02:14.159 --> 00:02:16.250 
after using its effect to make allele or
something<00:02:14.550> unless<00:02:15.360> you<00:02:15.480> have<00:02:15.659> spare<00:02:15.930> monsters

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
something unless you have spare monsters

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.170 
something unless you have spare monsters
in<00:02:16.379> your<00:02:16.409> hand<00:02:16.650> like<00:02:16.769> Tengu<00:02:17.220> are<00:02:17.610> the<00:02:17.790> field<00:02:18.000> to

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
in your hand like Tengu are the field to

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:19.850 
in your hand like Tengu are the field to
work<00:02:18.330> with<00:02:18.480> or<00:02:18.629> something<00:02:18.900> whatever<00:02:19.560> but<00:02:19.799> I

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
work with or something whatever but I

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.229 
work with or something whatever but I
think<00:02:20.069> it's<00:02:20.190> pretty<00:02:20.400> blatantly<00:02:20.790> obvious<00:02:20.940> that

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239 
think it's pretty blatantly obvious that

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:23.000 
think it's pretty blatantly obvious that
they<00:02:21.360> want<00:02:21.629> to<00:02:21.780> use<00:02:22.019> hot<00:02:22.319> red<00:02:22.560> dragon

Archfiend to be able to sing or

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:25.850 
Archfiend to be able to sing or
something<00:02:24.930> this<00:02:25.019> thing<00:02:25.230> because<00:02:25.590> i<00:02:25.620> have

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
something this thing because i have

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.530 
something this thing because i have
actually<00:02:26.159> a<00:02:26.370> lot<00:02:26.549> of<00:02:26.700> synergy<00:02:27.060> if<00:02:27.150> you<00:02:27.269> do<00:02:27.390> it

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
actually a lot of synergy if you do it

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.420 
actually a lot of synergy if you do it
that<00:02:27.690> way<00:02:27.900> if<00:02:28.440> you<00:02:28.530> summon<00:02:28.769> hot<00:02:28.980> red<00:02:29.160> dragon

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
that way if you summon hot red dragon

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:30.770 
that way if you summon hot red dragon

your<00:02:39.090> combo<00:02:39.480> but<00:02:39.750> I<00:02:39.780> think<00:02:39.870> limited<00:02:40.379> gets<00:02:40.500> so

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:40.799

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:43.009 
your combo but I think limited gets so
much<00:02:41.129> to<00:02:41.430> just<00:02:41.549> a<00:02:41.730> Dark<00:02:42.090> Dragon<00:02:42.480> type<00:02:42.810> non

use to be able to make this thing really
kind<00:02:47.250> of<00:02:47.310> brings<00:02:47.519> down<00:02:47.700> this<00:02:47.879> car<00:02:48.090> a<00:02:48.120> little

I'm<00:02:52.079> pretty<00:02:52.260> sure<00:02:52.470> samsara<00:02:53.310> is<00:02:53.430> one<00:02:53.849> but<00:02:54.569> I

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
I'm pretty sure samsara is one but I

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:56.930 
I'm pretty sure samsara is one but I
don't<00:02:55.650> think<00:02:55.739> there's<00:02:55.950> that<00:02:56.010> many<00:02:56.370> really<00:02:56.819> the

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
don't think there's that many really the

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:58.369 
don't think there's that many really the
only<00:02:57.030> ones<00:02:57.329> that<00:02:57.480> came<00:02:57.629> to<00:02:57.780> mind<00:02:57.930> where<00:02:58.200> the

00:02:58.369 --> 00:02:58.379 
only ones that came to mind where the

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:00.199 
only ones that came to mind where the
red<00:02:58.590> dragon<00:02:58.829> archfiend<00:02:59.459> in<00:02:59.549> the<00:02:59.760> hot<00:02:59.940> red

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
red dragon archfiend in the hot red

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:02.119 
red dragon archfiend in the hot red
dragon<00:03:00.569> Archfiend<00:03:01.019> and<00:03:01.230> I<00:03:01.650> guess<00:03:01.890> that's

00:03:02.119 --> 00:03:02.129 
dragon Archfiend and I guess that's

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:03.589 
dragon Archfiend and I guess that's
really<00:03:02.400> what<00:03:02.549> they<00:03:02.700> only<00:03:02.879> want<00:03:03.209> you<00:03:03.329> to<00:03:03.420> come

00:03:03.589 --> 00:03:03.599 
really what they only want you to come

seen a lot of synchro monsters get
played<00:03:07.019> already<00:03:07.319> and<00:03:07.590> the<00:03:07.920> fact<00:03:08.160> that<00:03:08.250> this<00:03:08.459> is

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:08.519 
played already and the fact that this is

played already and the fact that this is
relying<00:03:09.120> on<00:03:09.329> pretty<00:03:09.599> much<00:03:09.750> a<00:03:09.900> synchro

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
relying on pretty much a synchro

I'm kind of on the fence as if it'll

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:17.720 
I'm kind of on the fence as if it'll
actually<00:03:15.840> play<00:03:16.440> us<00:03:16.739> folks<00:03:17.040> here<00:03:17.220> in<00:03:17.280> the<00:03:17.340> TCG

deck<00:03:19.349> which<00:03:19.500> I'm<00:03:19.680> actually<00:03:19.829> really<00:03:20.099> curious

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400

to one we're getting that because I'm

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.360 
to one we're getting that because I'm
actually<00:03:21.959> really<00:03:22.319> excited<00:03:22.440> to<00:03:22.769> get<00:03:22.859> cards

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
actually really excited to get cards

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.640 
actually really excited to get cards
like<00:03:23.489> jet<00:03:23.730> Synchron<00:03:24.150> which<00:03:24.359> i<00:03:24.510> think<00:03:24.569> is<00:03:24.870> a

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
like jet Synchron which i think is a

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:27.890 
like jet Synchron which i think is a
recurring<00:03:26.280> one<00:03:27.030> tuner<00:03:27.329> that<00:03:27.480> you<00:03:27.569> can<00:03:27.690> special

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
recurring one tuner that you can special

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:28.940 
recurring one tuner that you can special
summon<00:03:27.930> the<00:03:28.200> graveyard<00:03:28.530> or<00:03:28.650> something

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
summon the graveyard or something

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:30.860 
summon the graveyard or something
whatever<00:03:29.910> it's<00:03:30.090> really<00:03:30.299> powerful<00:03:30.720> I<00:03:30.810> know

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
whatever it's really powerful I know

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:32.539 
whatever it's really powerful I know
that<00:03:31.139> maybe<00:03:31.410> then<00:03:31.620> if<00:03:31.739> we<00:03:31.829> get<00:03:31.980> this<00:03:32.099> sometime

00:03:32.539 --> 00:03:32.549 
that maybe then if we get this sometime

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:34.250 
that maybe then if we get this sometime
around<00:03:32.669> the<00:03:32.880> card<00:03:33.090> this<00:03:33.269> release<00:03:33.599> in<00:03:33.750> the<00:03:33.780> TCG

will actually see some play but at the

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:37.699 
will actually see some play but at the
moment<00:03:36.209> I<00:03:36.480> really<00:03:36.930> can't<00:03:37.200> think<00:03:37.319> of<00:03:37.440> a<00:03:37.530> deck

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
moment I really can't think of a deck
