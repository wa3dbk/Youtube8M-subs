would have helped ok so I have a tail at

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.849 
would have helped ok so I have a tail at
one<00:00:16.109> end<00:00:16.820> okay<00:00:17.820> i<00:00:18.029> need<00:00:18.180> a<00:00:18.330> cross<00:00:18.630> on<00:00:18.930> it<00:00:19.020> back<00:00:19.470> i

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
one end okay i need a cross on it back i

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.689 
one end okay i need a cross on it back i

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
bind off the tails at this end if i want

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.950 
bind off the tails at this end if i want
to<00:00:23.760> do<00:00:23.910> more<00:00:24.119> than<00:00:24.300> two<00:00:24.769> it<00:00:25.769> would<00:00:25.949> be<00:00:26.480> one<00:00:27.480> two

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
to do more than two it would be one two

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:33.020 
to do more than two it would be one two
three<00:00:29.060> four<00:00:30.710> then<00:00:31.710> find<00:00:32.009> off<00:00:32.250> so<00:00:32.759> that<00:00:32.790> the

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
three four then find off so that the

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.400 
three four then find off so that the
tails<00:00:33.239> of<00:00:33.390> this<00:00:33.540> end<00:00:33.780> so<00:00:33.899> you<00:00:33.960> can<00:00:34.110> either<00:00:34.200> do

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
tails of this end so you can either do

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.250 
tails of this end so you can either do
two<00:00:34.590> of<00:00:34.800> our<00:00:35.489> four<00:00:35.760> rows<00:00:35.940> so<00:00:36.660> maybe<00:00:36.870> I<00:00:36.960> misread

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
two of our four rows so maybe I misread

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.240 
two of our four rows so maybe I misread
what's<00:00:37.739> printed<00:00:38.129> on<00:00:38.399> the<00:00:38.579> website<00:00:39.030> or<00:00:39.980> it<00:00:40.980> was

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:25.990 
small project video is for finishing

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:31.230 
small project video is for finishing
that<00:01:26.170> last<00:01:26.680> it<00:01:27.870> coming<00:01:28.870> up<00:01:29.020> under<00:01:29.350> the<00:01:29.710> head<00:01:30.240> of

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:31.240 
that last it coming up under the head of

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.200 
that last it coming up under the head of
the<00:01:31.630> stitch<00:01:31.960> that<00:01:32.380> was<00:01:32.590> there<00:01:32.920> and<00:01:33.220> then<00:01:33.550> into

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:34.210 
the stitch that was there and then into

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:38.340 
the stitch that was there and then into
that<00:01:35.200> left<00:01:35.440> it<00:01:36.150> like<00:01:37.150> that<00:01:37.180> and<00:01:37.720> then<00:01:37.990> I<00:01:38.020> just

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:38.350 
that left it like that and then I just

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:42.870 
that left it like that and then I just
pull<00:01:38.650> this<00:01:38.890> guy<00:01:39.160> over<00:01:39.370> and<00:01:40.530> then<00:01:41.530> signed<00:01:42.460> up<00:01:42.670> as

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:42.880 
pull this guy over and then signed up as

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:47.610 
pull this guy over and then signed up as
usual<00:01:44.010> it<00:01:45.010> helps<00:01:45.490> to<00:01:45.700> tack<00:01:46.300> this<00:01:46.660> very<00:01:47.020> end<00:01:47.290> one

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:47.620 
usual it helps to tack this very end one

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:51.359 
usual it helps to tack this very end one
down<00:01:48.330> and<00:01:49.330> then<00:01:49.869> to<00:01:50.170> finish<00:01:50.440> off<00:01:50.860> your<00:01:50.890> loop

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:51.369 
down and then to finish off your loop

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:54.210 
down and then to finish off your loop
you<00:01:52.030> just<00:01:52.240> draw<00:01:52.479> your<00:01:52.750> yarn<00:01:52.990> through<00:01:53.410> because

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:54.220 
you just draw your yarn through because

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:55.469 
you just draw your yarn through because
you're<00:01:54.430> probably<00:01:54.520> laughing<00:01:54.820> how<00:01:55.150> many<00:01:55.300> times

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:55.479 
you're probably laughing how many times

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:58.680 
you're probably laughing how many times
the<00:01:55.630> DP<00:01:55.960> ends<00:01:56.080> at<00:01:56.260> the<00:01:56.290> floor<00:01:56.610> and<00:01:57.610> then<00:01:57.910> oh<00:01:58.119> how

00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:58.690 
the DP ends at the floor and then oh how

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:02.370 
the DP ends at the floor and then oh how
the<00:01:59.650> lights<00:01:59.890> on<00:02:00.070> and<00:02:00.810> then<00:02:01.810> pull<00:02:02.110> your<00:02:02.290> yarn

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:02.380 
the lights on and then pull your yarn

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.500 
the lights on and then pull your yarn
through<00:02:02.710> which<00:02:02.890> is<00:02:03.040> going<00:02:03.190> to<00:02:03.250> secure<00:02:03.670> it<00:02:03.820> plus

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:04.510 
through which is going to secure it plus

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:06.210 
through which is going to secure it plus
I<00:02:04.660> need<00:02:04.720> the<00:02:04.960> extra<00:02:05.229> yarn<00:02:05.530> at<00:02:05.680> the<00:02:05.770> end<00:02:05.920> anyway

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:06.220 
I need the extra yarn at the end anyway

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:08.280 
I need the extra yarn at the end anyway
so<00:02:06.280> it<00:02:06.490> has<00:02:06.670> to<00:02:06.760> be<00:02:06.880> sewn<00:02:07.090> in<00:02:07.240> but<00:02:07.810> see<00:02:07.960> how<00:02:08.110> much

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:08.290 
so it has to be sewn in but see how much

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:10.109 
so it has to be sewn in but see how much
shorter<00:02:08.740> that<00:02:08.920> little<00:02:09.220> guy<00:02:09.399> is<00:02:09.459> and<00:02:09.820> if<00:02:10.000> you've

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:10.119 
shorter that little guy is and if you've

needles leaving a longest tail for
sewing<00:02:29.380> later<00:02:29.709> so<00:02:30.570> I'm<00:02:31.570> going<00:02:31.900> to<00:02:31.930> make<00:02:32.110> my

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:32.410 
sewing later so I'm going to make my

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:36.449 
sewing later so I'm going to make my
glove<00:02:32.830> insert<00:02:33.459> in<00:02:33.730> brown<00:02:35.070> and<00:02:36.070> I<00:02:36.220> know<00:02:36.280> I've

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:36.459 
glove insert in brown and I know I've

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:38.160 
glove insert in brown and I know I've
already<00:02:36.580> demonstrated<00:02:37.239> a<00:02:37.269> long<00:02:37.420> tail<00:02:37.660> cast<00:02:37.900> on

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
already demonstrated a long tail cast on

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:39.780 
already demonstrated a long tail cast on
it<00:02:38.410> so<00:02:38.860> I'm<00:02:38.920> going<00:02:39.070> to<00:02:39.100> just<00:02:39.280> do<00:02:39.580> it<00:02:39.670> really

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
it so I'm going to just do it really

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:42.030 
it so I'm going to just do it really
really<00:02:39.910> really<00:02:40.269> fast<00:02:40.570> as<00:02:40.780> far<00:02:40.959> as<00:02:41.019> demo<00:02:41.290> okay

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
really really fast as far as demo okay

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.729 
really really fast as far as demo okay
so<00:02:42.100> normally<00:02:42.580> i<00:02:42.610> would<00:02:42.880> probably<00:02:43.209> need<00:02:43.739> the

00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:44.739 
so normally i would probably need the

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:47.970 
so normally i would probably need the
yarn<00:02:45.010> from<00:02:45.400> my<00:02:46.300> fingertips<00:02:46.360> to<00:02:47.050> say<00:02:47.230> my<00:02:47.410> bicep

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
yarn from my fingertips to say my bicep

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.880 
yarn from my fingertips to say my bicep

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
for 27 stitches but since it's supposed

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:53.340 
for 27 stitches but since it's supposed
to<00:02:51.010> be<00:02:51.220> a<00:02:51.250> longest<00:02:52.090> tail<00:02:52.450> and<00:02:52.989> i<00:02:53.080> don't<00:02:53.260> know

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:53.350
