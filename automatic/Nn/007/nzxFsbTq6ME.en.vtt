know<00:01:49.470> I<00:01:49.649> can<00:01:50.009> be<00:01:50.100> the<00:01:50.220> best<00:01:50.399> and<00:01:50.820> for<00:01:51.630> me<00:01:51.780> it's

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
know I can be the best and for me it's

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.170 
know I can be the best and for me it's
like<00:01:52.409> I<00:01:52.740> know<00:01:52.920> I'm<00:01:53.159> the<00:01:53.250> best<00:01:53.430> I<00:01:53.729> don't<00:01:53.970> have<00:01:54.060> to

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
like I know I'm the best I don't have to

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.630 
like I know I'm the best I don't have to
remind<00:01:54.450> anybody<00:01:54.829> but<00:01:55.829> I<00:01:55.890> have<00:01:56.130> to<00:01:56.250> prove<00:01:56.490> it

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
remind anybody but I have to prove it

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.940 
remind anybody but I have to prove it
every<00:01:56.790> year<00:01:57.030> at<00:01:57.149> the<00:01:57.270> Olympia<00:01:57.659> yeah<00:01:58.079> so<00:01:58.500> my

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
every year at the Olympia yeah so my

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.590 
every year at the Olympia yeah so my
approach<00:01:59.219> going<00:01:59.430> into<00:01:59.790> it<00:01:59.909> is<00:02:00.000> that<00:02:00.180> I've

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
approach going into it is that I've

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.200 
approach going into it is that I've
already<00:02:00.750> done<00:02:00.869> this<00:02:01.140> twice<00:02:01.409> I<00:02:02.030> should<00:02:03.030> be<00:02:03.149> able

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
already done this twice I should be able

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.940 
already done this twice I should be able
to<00:02:03.329> do<00:02:03.420> it<00:02:03.509> again<00:02:03.750> because<00:02:04.560> I<00:02:04.680> have<00:02:04.829> the

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
to do it again because I have the

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.190 
to do it again because I have the
blueprint<00:02:05.369> but<00:02:06.180> I<00:02:06.210> just<00:02:06.420> have<00:02:06.570> to<00:02:06.600> finally

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
blueprint but I just have to finally

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.109 
blueprint but I just have to finally
execute<00:02:07.770> it<00:02:07.860> no<00:02:08.099> matter<00:02:08.280> what<00:02:08.580> distraction

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
execute it no matter what distraction

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.839 
execute it no matter what distraction
and<00:02:09.509> does<00:02:09.899> everything<00:02:10.110> always<00:02:10.319> go<00:02:10.619> to<00:02:10.679> plan<00:02:10.849> so

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
and does everything always go to plan so

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:15.710 
and does everything always go to plan so
yes<00:02:12.060> or<00:02:12.209> no<00:02:12.360> I<00:02:12.599> mean<00:02:12.950> yes<00:02:13.950> because<00:02:14.370> I<00:02:14.489> won<00:02:14.730> no

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
yes or no I mean yes because I won no

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.300 
yes or no I mean yes because I won no
because<00:02:16.170> there's<00:02:16.440> always<00:02:16.680> something<00:02:17.069> that

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
because there's always something that

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.290 
because there's always something that
gets<00:02:17.489> thrown<00:02:17.700> in<00:02:18.530> your<00:02:19.530> body<00:02:19.709> is<00:02:19.830> very<00:02:20.300> dynamic

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
gets thrown in your body is very dynamic

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.280 
gets thrown in your body is very dynamic
so<00:02:21.890> you<00:02:22.890> can<00:02:23.069> be<00:02:23.160> training<00:02:23.840> you<00:02:24.840> can<00:02:24.989> get<00:02:25.110> hurt

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
so you can be training you can get hurt

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.080 
so you can be training you can get hurt
while<00:02:25.530> you're<00:02:25.680> training<00:02:25.830> you<00:02:26.580> can<00:02:26.730> be<00:02:26.790> eating

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
while you're training you can be eating

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.490 
while you're training you can be eating
something<00:02:27.330> either<00:02:28.319> get<00:02:28.530> sick<00:02:28.800> or<00:02:30.260> maybe<00:02:31.260> your

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
something either get sick or maybe your

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:32.960 
something either get sick or maybe your
body<00:02:31.680> doesn't<00:02:31.920> respond<00:02:32.430> the<00:02:32.580> way<00:02:32.670> that<00:02:32.819> you

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
body doesn't respond the way that you

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:34.790 
body doesn't respond the way that you
had<00:02:33.090> hoped<00:02:33.209> it<00:02:33.540> would<00:02:33.870> because<00:02:34.440> maybe<00:02:34.620> your

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
had hoped it would because maybe your

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.130 
had hoped it would because maybe your
body<00:02:34.920> just<00:02:35.220> gets<00:02:36.000> a<00:02:36.239> resistant<00:02:36.840> to<00:02:37.019> that

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
body just gets a resistant to that

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.430 
body just gets a resistant to that
different<00:02:37.470> type<00:02:37.590> of<00:02:37.620> food<00:02:39.140> that's<00:02:40.140> where

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
different type of food that's where

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.740 
different type of food that's where
being<00:02:41.310> a<00:02:41.489> coach<00:02:41.790> of<00:02:41.819> yourself

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
being a coach of yourself

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.460 
being a coach of yourself
plays<00:02:43.349> a<00:02:43.379> huge<00:02:43.739> role<00:02:44.069> or<00:02:44.459> hiring<00:02:44.790> a<00:02:45.030> coach

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
plays a huge role or hiring a coach

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:47.780 
plays a huge role or hiring a coach

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
adjustments to be able to switch gears

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:54.500 
adjustments to be able to switch gears
at<00:02:51.360> a<00:02:51.420> drop<00:02:51.690> of<00:02:51.720> a<00:02:51.870> dime<00:02:51.900> and<00:02:52.830> then<00:02:53.670> be<00:02:54.239> able<00:02:54.420> to

it's hard to summarize it up but was it

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:19.580 
it's hard to summarize it up but was it
expected<00:03:18.420> did<00:03:18.690> you<00:03:18.810> have<00:03:18.989> that<00:03:19.140> in<00:03:19.230> your<00:03:19.319> mind

come out the blue what did they actually
feel<00:03:22.409> like<00:03:22.440> the<00:03:22.650> moment<00:03:22.950> it<00:03:23.010> happened<00:03:23.310> well<00:03:24.150> I

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
feel like the moment it happened well I

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:27.020 
feel like the moment it happened well I
would<00:03:24.930> say<00:03:25.049> like<00:03:25.260> this<00:03:25.409> in<00:03:25.620> 2008<00:03:26.489> I<00:03:26.700> thought<00:03:27.000> I

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
would say like this in 2008 I thought I

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:29.000 
would say like this in 2008 I thought I
had<00:03:27.180> a<00:03:27.209> chance<00:03:27.480> I<00:03:27.690> got<00:03:27.840> third<00:03:28.110> I<00:03:28.379> was<00:03:28.890> very

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
had a chance I got third I was very

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:30.229 
had a chance I got third I was very
excited<00:03:29.159> about<00:03:29.459> that<00:03:29.640> because<00:03:29.790> I<00:03:29.970> knew<00:03:30.090> that

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239 
excited about that because I knew that

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:32.160 
excited about that because I knew that
history<00:03:30.569> had<00:03:30.780> been<00:03:30.810> made

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:32.170 
history had been made

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:34.949 
history had been made
no<00:03:32.800> rookie<00:03:32.980> at<00:03:33.160> the<00:03:33.250> time<00:03:33.490> in<00:03:34.360> over<00:03:34.480> ten<00:03:34.750> years
