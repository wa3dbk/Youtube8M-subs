in<00:00:35.340> the<00:00:35.430> state's<00:00:35.670> night<00:00:35.910> I<00:00:36.090> think<00:00:36.360> the<00:00:36.450> song<00:00:36.690> in

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
in the state's night I think the song in

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.900 
in the state's night I think the song in
general<00:00:37.260> has<00:00:37.380> a<00:00:37.410> lot<00:00:37.620> of<00:00:37.649> character<00:00:38.160> so<00:00:38.520> when

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
general has a lot of character so when

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.850 
general has a lot of character so when
we<00:00:39.059> found<00:00:39.360> out<00:00:39.540> we<00:00:39.690> had<00:00:39.719> then<00:00:40.200> we<00:00:40.320> were<00:00:40.469> like<00:00:40.649> oh

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
we found out we had then we were like oh

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.970 
we found out we had then we were like oh
perfect<00:00:41.790> fit<00:00:42.390> for<00:00:42.420> them<00:00:42.780> and<00:00:43.020> we<00:00:43.440> just<00:00:43.680> really

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
perfect fit for them and we just really

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.709 
perfect fit for them and we just really
wanted<00:00:44.160> to<00:00:44.250> bring<00:00:44.399> out<00:00:44.579> the<00:00:44.700> fun<00:00:44.940> in<00:00:45.180> them<00:00:45.480> and

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
wanted to bring out the fun in them and

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.600 
wanted to bring out the fun in them and
the<00:00:45.930> fund<00:00:46.110> in<00:00:46.230> the<00:00:46.320> song<00:00:46.530> and<00:00:46.920> and<00:00:47.430> I<00:00:47.579> think

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
the fund in the song and and I think

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.389 
the fund in the song and and I think
obviously<00:00:47.969> it's<00:00:48.360> pretty<00:00:49.050> literal<00:00:49.350> hotel<00:00:49.920> you

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
obviously it's pretty literal hotel you

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:51.590 
obviously it's pretty literal hotel you
