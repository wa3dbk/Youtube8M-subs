00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:05.540 
the lesson on the digestive system

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:07.280 
the lesson on the digestive system
functions<00:00:06.540> of<00:00:06.660> the<00:00:06.750> digestive<00:00:07.259> system

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
functions of the digestive system

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.540 
functions of the digestive system
include<00:00:08.240> ingestion<00:00:09.240> the<00:00:10.080> act<00:00:10.290> of<00:00:10.550> physically

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
include ingestion the act of physically

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.520 
include ingestion the act of physically
putting<00:00:11.910> food<00:00:12.150> into<00:00:12.420> your<00:00:12.599> mouth<00:00:12.660> that's

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
putting food into your mouth that's

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.730 
putting food into your mouth that's
ingesting<00:00:14.630> mechanical<00:00:15.630> breakdown<00:00:16.080> starts<00:00:16.590> in

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
ingesting mechanical breakdown starts in

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.400 
ingesting mechanical breakdown starts in
the<00:00:16.830> mouth<00:00:17.010> that's<00:00:17.880> with<00:00:18.510> the<00:00:18.539> teeth<00:00:18.930> with<00:00:19.350> the

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
the mouth that's with the teeth with the

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.040 
the mouth that's with the teeth with the
tongue<00:00:19.830> when<00:00:20.670> you<00:00:20.789> swallow<00:00:21.300> food<00:00:21.689> your

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
tongue when you swallow food your

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.140 
tongue when you swallow food your
stomach<00:00:22.500> does<00:00:22.680> mechanical<00:00:23.220> digestion<00:00:23.580> that's

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
stomach does mechanical digestion that's

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.950 
stomach does mechanical digestion that's
anytime<00:00:24.810> you're<00:00:25.470> ripping<00:00:26.279> tearing<00:00:26.960> crushing

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
anytime you're ripping tearing crushing

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.110 
anytime you're ripping tearing crushing
food<00:00:28.289> so<00:00:29.070> that's<00:00:29.250> the<00:00:29.369> physical<00:00:30.470> breakdown

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:32.120 
food so that's the physical breakdown

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:35.600 
food so that's the physical breakdown
digestion<00:00:33.290> itself<00:00:34.290> if<00:00:34.530> we<00:00:34.649> look<00:00:34.800> at<00:00:34.920> like<00:00:35.130> what

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
digestion itself if we look at like what

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.420 
digestion itself if we look at like what
causes<00:00:36.030> digestion<00:00:36.360> to<00:00:36.540> occur<00:00:37.430> mechanical

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
causes digestion to occur mechanical

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.580 
causes digestion to occur mechanical
breakdown<00:00:38.850> does<00:00:39.059> assist<00:00:39.360> with<00:00:39.510> it<00:00:39.690> but<00:00:40.410> on<00:00:40.559> a

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
breakdown does assist with it but on a

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.650 
breakdown does assist with it but on a
microscopic<00:00:41.190> level<00:00:41.370> it's<00:00:41.910> the<00:00:42.149> chemical

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
microscopic level it's the chemical

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.600 
microscopic level it's the chemical
breakdown<00:00:42.899> that<00:00:43.379> that<00:00:43.649> really<00:00:44.100> gets<00:00:44.219> it<00:00:44.430> done

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
breakdown that that really gets it done

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.229 
breakdown that that really gets it done
that's<00:00:45.300> enzymes<00:00:46.070> acids<00:00:47.070> all<00:00:47.399> those<00:00:47.940> molecules

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
that's enzymes acids all those molecules

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.950 
that's enzymes acids all those molecules
that<00:00:48.870> that<00:00:49.230> physically<00:00:49.770> break<00:00:50.160> down

cover the accessory organs that are off
to<00:02:08.819> the<00:02:08.940> side<00:02:09.239> of<00:02:09.270> the<00:02:09.690> track<00:02:09.959> like<00:02:10.560> the<00:02:10.709> liver

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
to the side of the track like the liver

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.640 
to the side of the track like the liver
and<00:02:11.400> the<00:02:11.430> pancreas

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
and the pancreas

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:14.839 
and the pancreas
so<00:02:13.769> of<00:02:13.890> course<00:02:14.010> it<00:02:14.220> starts<00:02:14.340> with<00:02:14.519> the<00:02:14.640> mouth

00:02:14.839 --> 00:02:14.849

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:17.890 
so of course it starts with the mouth
you<00:02:15.689> swallow<00:02:16.110> food<00:02:16.500> goes<00:02:16.829> down<00:02:17.099> the<00:02:17.280> pharynx

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
you swallow food goes down the pharynx

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.780 
you swallow food goes down the pharynx
right<00:02:18.900> in<00:02:19.049> here<00:02:19.439> and<00:02:19.620> then<00:02:20.370> into<00:02:20.670> the

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
right in here and then into the

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.360 
right in here and then into the
esophagus<00:02:21.090> if<00:02:21.689> it<00:02:21.959> goes<00:02:22.140> down<00:02:22.200> into<00:02:23.159> the

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
esophagus if it goes down into the

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.250 
esophagus if it goes down into the
larynx<00:02:23.670> trachea<00:02:23.879> you<00:02:24.329> have<00:02:24.480> a<00:02:24.510> problem<00:02:24.870> and

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
larynx trachea you have a problem and

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.679 
larynx trachea you have a problem and
you<00:02:25.379> could<00:02:25.620> be<00:02:25.860> choking<00:02:26.400> or<00:02:26.579> aspirating<00:02:27.569> and

00:02:27.679 --> 00:02:27.689 
you could be choking or aspirating and

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:30.289 
you could be choking or aspirating and
then<00:02:27.870> that's<00:02:28.049> no<00:02:28.230> good<00:02:28.760> once<00:02:29.760> food<00:02:30.090> and

00:02:30.289 --> 00:02:30.299 
then that's no good once food and

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:32.240 
then that's no good once food and
liquids<00:02:30.599> go<00:02:30.750> down<00:02:30.930> the<00:02:31.109> esophagus<00:02:31.439> they<00:02:31.980> enter

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
liquids go down the esophagus they enter

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.190 
liquids go down the esophagus they enter
the<00:02:32.400> stomach<00:02:32.819> from<00:02:33.299> the<00:02:33.480> stomach<00:02:33.780> we<00:02:34.079> go

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
the stomach from the stomach we go

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.220 
the stomach from the stomach we go
through<00:02:34.409> the<00:02:34.500> small<00:02:34.769> intestine<00:02:35.629> the<00:02:36.629> longest

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
through the small intestine the longest

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:40.309 
through the small intestine the longest
portion<00:02:37.939> percentage-wise<00:02:38.939> of<00:02:39.420> the<00:02:39.780> GI<00:02:39.959> tract

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:40.319 
portion percentage-wise of the GI tract

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:43.160 
portion percentage-wise of the GI tract
then<00:02:40.950> the<00:02:41.189> large<00:02:41.519> intestine<00:02:42.239> which<00:02:42.780> is<00:02:42.959> large

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
then the large intestine which is large

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.830 
then the large intestine which is large
in<00:02:43.379> terms<00:02:43.530> of<00:02:43.650> width<00:02:43.950> not<00:02:44.489> length<00:02:44.810> which<00:02:45.810> is

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
in terms of width not length which is

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.930 
in terms of width not length which is
right<00:02:46.109> here<00:02:46.440> most<00:02:47.159> of<00:02:47.310> it<00:02:47.400> is<00:02:47.489> known<00:02:47.639> as<00:02:47.760> the

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
right here most of it is known as the

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.599 
right here most of it is known as the
colon<00:02:48.420> and<00:02:48.659> then<00:02:49.590> you<00:02:49.799> get<00:02:49.950> into<00:02:50.040> the<00:02:50.250> rectum

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:50.609 
colon and then you get into the rectum

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:54.500 
colon and then you get into the rectum
and<00:02:50.849> the<00:02:50.940> anus<00:02:53.030> so<00:02:54.030> we're<00:02:54.120> gonna<00:02:54.239> start<00:02:54.420> with

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
and the anus so we're gonna start with

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.860 
and the anus so we're gonna start with
the<00:02:54.569> oral<00:02:54.870> cavity<00:02:55.079> the<00:02:55.440> mouth<00:02:56.480> the<00:02:57.480> the

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
the oral cavity the mouth the the

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.649 
the oral cavity the mouth the the
starting<00:02:58.500> of<00:02:58.680> the<00:02:59.099> chemical<00:02:59.909> digestion<00:03:00.420> of

00:03:00.649 --> 00:03:00.659 
starting of the chemical digestion of

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:02.569 
starting of the chemical digestion of
food<00:03:00.930> is<00:03:01.260> definitely<00:03:01.590> due<00:03:01.950> to<00:03:02.069> salivary

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:02.579 
food is definitely due to salivary

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:05.390 
food is definitely due to salivary
glands<00:03:02.959> even<00:03:03.959> just<00:03:04.170> seeing<00:03:04.530> food<00:03:05.040> on

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
glands even just seeing food on

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.660 
glands even just seeing food on
television<00:03:06.269> or<00:03:06.480> seeing<00:03:06.810> a<00:03:06.900> picture<00:03:07.139> of<00:03:07.379> food

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 
smelling food is going to initiate

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:12.729 
smelling food is going to initiate
salivation<00:03:11.010> and<00:03:11.730> you<00:03:11.790> have<00:03:11.879> three<00:03:12.209> pairs<00:03:12.510> of

00:03:12.729 --> 00:03:12.739 
salivation and you have three pairs of

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:15.520 
salivation and you have three pairs of
salivary<00:03:13.739> glands<00:03:14.189> for<00:03:14.549> total<00:03:14.790> of<00:03:14.879> six<00:03:15.150> the

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
lift up their tongue and you can see

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:31.699 
lift up their tongue and you can see

salivary<00:03:58.650> glands<00:03:58.919> release<00:03:59.159> saliva<00:03:59.790> so<00:04:00.209> what's

00:04:00.439 --> 00:04:00.449 
salivary glands release saliva so what's

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:03.050 
salivary glands release saliva so what's
in<00:04:00.599> saliva<00:04:00.930> well<00:04:01.290> the<00:04:01.919> vast<00:04:02.280> majority<00:04:02.459> of<00:04:02.909> it

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
in saliva well the vast majority of it

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:05.300 
in saliva well the vast majority of it
is<00:04:03.150> water<00:04:03.479> but<00:04:04.139> what's<00:04:04.290> the<00:04:04.470> other<00:04:04.620> point<00:04:04.949> six

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 
is water but what's the other point six

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:08.860 
is water but what's the other point six
