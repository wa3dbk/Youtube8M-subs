00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.090
 hello everyone and bryce the blog the 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:05.009
 stay the books moments of 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:09.020
 writing and today I bring you a new 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.020
 section that I'm going to headline that I read 

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:30.750
 well basically because I'm recording 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:32.070
 the memory just finished the bus and 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.930
 Now I'm going to start with this new 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.940
 section that already explain me if I do not 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.430
 you remember good explains is a section 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.680
 very simple, basically, when 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.420
 have a question about how much is that 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.820
 mind is that when I have a doubt with 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.830
 what book to read invent it I'll give 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.920
 alternatives or basically I'm going to 

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:50.940
 ask what can I read okay and I 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.400
 would like me to leave in the 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.930
 comments that you prefer a book then 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:57.030
 that more comes out where I'll start reading 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.950
 I do not know I'm a person who costs 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.800
 a lot to decide when you have things 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:04.440
 earrings to do I never know how to see 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.750
 the books on the shelves and I never know 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:09.170
 why decide me so I would love 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.170
 what manizales 

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:21.560
 are from montena territorial is going to draw from 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:24.020
 his book that I think is very little has 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.640
 of laura Galician and until not reviewed 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:28.759
 this book will not be able to ask another 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:31.440
 I have many to have a year so 

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:35.180
 well I do not know if it was the best 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:35.180
 the smile a kiss 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.280
 I really do not have yet why this 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:44.840
 book but I do not know I have enough people 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:47.700
 he really wants that book 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.560
 and that's just a whim 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.830
 because I really want to read it now and 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.810
 I do not know what to do the truth because I have 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:56.010
 they are going to have it but I am that I have some 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.210
 our earrings and for now they are very 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:59.310
 important and I want to read your 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.750
 continuations or if you want to read a 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.980
 book that is going to post a bit of 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.980
 story is that I do not know 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:16.600
 this third part that is a bone 

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:19.000
 because they were 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:22.630
 tonight it's not going to take me a while and 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:26.500
 the fourth one that is published very little 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:29.790
 I also do not know what he does because 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.790
 teach this product 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:40.650
 so you tell me what is better 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.650
 one of these books 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:46.519
 a book you 

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:53.630
 tell me which one do you want better than 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:58.780
 start reading and all that but 6 the 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:58.780
 comments and well it is simply 

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:10.910
 because I never decide at the end so 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:12.230
 well I hope this helps me but 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:15.140
 I also believe to keep our opinion 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:16.550
 all that about some things and you 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:19.190
