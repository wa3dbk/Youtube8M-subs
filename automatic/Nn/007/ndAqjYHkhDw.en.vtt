00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:09.330
 hello everyone we are on paris 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:10.050
 tor tv for our daily received five 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.639
 out of five 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.650
 we will study the proposed quinté this 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.000
 Monday at the Compiègne racecourse and 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.650
 my sides and françois krug hello 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.500
 françois au jour florent hello everyone 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.420
 So we'll meet again this Monday, March 9th on 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.220
 the polecat racecourse there will be sixteen 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.810
 4-year-old competitors in battle 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.580
 francois you can talk to us a 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.140
 little bit of the course where we know that 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.160
 on this track the places to the rope 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.929
 can be important 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.239
 exactly and even more so on 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.410
 1600 meters so the question is to 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.450
 know what will be the state of the land in 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.879
 revenge because yes the currently the 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.190
 tracks are rather relaxed but of 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:42.989
 good weather is announced all the while 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.850
 weekend in the Paris region what is 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.379
 who should be drying out the 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.059
 field and the more the field will be dry 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.010
 more rope places will play a 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.750
 important role in my opinion it's true 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.920
 it's true we see it every year 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.320
 so it should be taken into account in hall 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.899
 to perform your games so we start 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.690
 by your rich French selection all 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:04.110
 first number 5 magician make my 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:07.500
 day then the 8 brezina the 3 lotus garden 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:12.150
 the ciss steph 'he wears up even 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:15.180
 nouara the 2 reding the number 10 tarnac 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.799
 and finally number 4 lagoon a boy so 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.540
 in this relatively open quinté you 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.369
 have decided to place at the top of your 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.409
 selection the resident of david smaga 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.189
 the magic number 5 make my day 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.930
 what can you tell us 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.189
 first of all it's a very good foal 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.439
 born well since his grandmother is 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.280
 other than the classic atouf that had 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.409
 shined at the highest level 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.020
 so he came late to the 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:35.939
 competition last June he 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.520
 progresses nicely it's a horse that 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:40.020
 was not very early and so who 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.850
 progresses and who will probably still 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.409
 improve to my eyes now it is 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.540
 mature to try a career in the 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.950
 disabilities a career with success I 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.210
 finds it properly placed in addition to it 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.790
 inherited a good place to rope and 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.049
 it is an easy horse to use so to 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.759
 my sense he has a lot of assets in his 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:55.259
 game and we know that david smaga has 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.590
 prepared his boarders for the big 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.180
 disabilities 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.530
 yes and progress them nicely 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.969
 without burning the steps what is 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.009
 important to succeed in 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:03.450
 disabilities so about your favorite 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:05.280
 magician mac but halls to 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.689
 stromboli our confrere met 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.900
 alexis badel who does not hide his 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:09.520
 trust 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:13.690
 it does not look bad he does his 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:15.040
 back I guess he has the job the 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:15.970
 work is necessary to run well 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.560
 I think it's a horse that 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:20.440
 enjoy the flexible tracks it 's not going to 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.790
 to disturb I know how to ride 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:24.100
 pretty classic way if I can say 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:25.150
 and I run in whom I trust with 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:27.490
 which I finished second at 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:29.170
 deauville precisely he is second to 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:30.510
 double this winter you go down 1900 m and 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.380
 there he finds the mile 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.180
 it is true that it is quite happy with the 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:34.890
 to climb 700 meters will be the case of rhythm 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.640
 slaughter case 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.470
 it seems to me that he had won at 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.420
 clairefontaine in soft ground so 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:41.740
 so I think the conquest profile 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:45.130
 with the rise will not disturb him 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:46.330
 may have benefited me so I am 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:46.810
 hurry to ride it I hope that 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:48.190
 It will be alright 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:51.970
 we 're including you for a place in 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:53.140
 the five yes so in second position 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:55.060
 then you put the number 8 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:56.170
 brain senate that probably does not 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:59.320
 to condemn on his last failure 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:01.420
 thannois yes so his coach was 

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:02.830
 really very dissatisfied with the state of the 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:05.170
 track just read his statements 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:07.990
 in Paris turf where he 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:11.380
 he even argues that we should have canceled 

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:12.610
 test because it was unworthy to respect 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:15.130
 the respect we drink for 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:16.780
 wagerers in any event the brazil 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:18.130
 did not race it's that day 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:19.720
 we must take it back because its previous 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:21.670
 attempt was noticed she had been 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.540
 beaten year ending very strong 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:23.769
 in a quinté 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.970
 we would have very good but we can 

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:27.550
 remember the last psf 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:29.320
 Cagnoise and there was a lot more so 

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:30.820
 she was in bad condition an attempt 

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:33.040
 probably to forget in third 

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:35.230
 position you then place the number 3 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.550
 lotus garden that day was needed 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:38.709
 the boarder of fabrice chappet he has 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:39.430
 been penalized but living slow or even 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:41.170
 competitive 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:43.330
 yes it is a horse that I believe in 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:44.650
 full blooming so who are coming 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:46.959
 fit at the right time I think that 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:48.730
 beginning of the season the form takes precedence over the 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:50.709
 class on sure a lot of elements 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:53.110
 especially the weight besides it does not have 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:54.640
 been wang hair massacre there he had well 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:55.810
 won the other day and on his way he 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:58.660
 is able again very well 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:00.370
 to do okay then in fourth 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:01.900
 position the number 6 7 and son a 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:04.239
 pascal bary resident who performs 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:06.970
 his return there is course once I believe 

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:08.799
 during the winter in deauville very well in 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:09.810
 withdrawal and is a little better placed at 

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:11.130
 weight that 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:12.690
 last year when he ran the 

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:14.160
 handicaps it was dropped by 3 pounds 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:14.520
 it's not huge and three books but it's 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.859
 account 

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:18.630
 so he is at his weight I think he 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:20.370
 should not be too far from his 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:21.900
 good physical shape he's associated with 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:23.340
 christophe submit me I think he 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:25.740
 can even win so it goes well 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:26.970
 okay is in fifth position going 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:28.440
 at number one up to benoît runes 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:29.850
 resident of yohan mollo who did 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:31.710
 proof of exemplary regularity the 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:33.480
 past season and who will have against it the 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:36.960
 fulfilling his return but that's 

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:39.090
 a filly of progress that must 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:40.139
 still improve this year and who 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:41.760
 likes very flexible terrain and who 

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:43.500
 will leave with the mirror at the rope so 

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:45.900
 I see it well in the first five 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:47.400
 rather for a place at the end of the wharf 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:48.840
 combination you placed the number 4 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:50.729
 laguna boy a resident of henri-alex 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:52.320
 pantall that has not been seen since 

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:53.010
 victory at the end of the year on the psf de 

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:54.930
 deauville 

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:56.100
 yes but this day the was successful 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:57.479
 better value and I like them 

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:58.860
 horses that are on the rise 

00:04:57.479 --> 00:04:59.820
 so it's true that he took 7 pounds 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:03.240
 that's a lot it's true too 

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:04.889
 he's back, but there's the stable 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:06.300
 pantale still shows a 

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:08.700
 certain form we have seen with the 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:09.600
 success of the last of his thoughts of 

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:11.190
 residents and representative of 

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:13.530
 the stable lately so even 

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:14.780
 with a real weight revised upwards it has 

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:16.500
 his say for an accessit 

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:18.810

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:21.770
