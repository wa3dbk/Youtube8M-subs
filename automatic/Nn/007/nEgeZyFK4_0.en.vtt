hours<00:01:47.970> and<00:01:48.299> I<00:01:48.540> do<00:01:48.600> not<00:01:48.899> really<00:01:49.170> recommend

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:50.270

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
using it for 24 hours because it's best

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.880 
using it for 24 hours because it's best
to<00:01:53.850> remove<00:01:54.479> your<00:01:54.810> makeup<00:01:55.079> at<00:01:55.380> the<00:01:55.500> end<00:01:55.680> of<00:01:55.770> the

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
day but as you can see it is smudge

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.350 
day but as you can see it is smudge
proof

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:01.360 
proof

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:05.350 
there and I've tried using this in one

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:08.999 
there and I've tried using this in one
of<00:02:05.470> my<00:02:05.710> tutorials<00:02:06.190> and<00:02:07.619> after<00:02:08.619> doing<00:02:08.860> that

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:09.009 
of my tutorials and after doing that

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:12.470 
of my tutorials and after doing that

tutorial I washed or rinse my face

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.540 
tutorial I washed or rinse my face

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
even if I wash it with water so I really
