00:00:23.329 --> 00:00:26.329
 no 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:55.390
 true 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:48.870
 at 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:51.870
 no 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.330
 the for 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:09.580
 besides those from the back we asked that this as a threat to 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:10.949
 equalize 

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:13.949
 then fetched the match in hand thirty seconds of racing 

00:02:14.679 --> 00:02:18.269
 you know football like that sense right now it gives us a 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:19.499
 Sakassou 

00:02:19.499 --> 00:02:21.279
 automoto is a little stronger 

00:02:21.279 --> 00:02:24.659
 I think it is a match that must be remembered leading to a good thing 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:27.799
 the strap match like that +% 

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:30.239
 the couple to change indicator 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:32.650
 what is needed is an approach that does not conform to the forecasts of the 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:35.639
 nhc motivated and aggressive 

00:02:35.639 --> 00:02:38.639
 but simply glossed I think the place clemenceau break 

00:02:39.339 --> 00:02:42.259
 second this year this season the championship is very up for 

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:45.559
 understand that it was not the joy to make room in the first 

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:48.559
 match we can no longer function as an image that does not scare 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:53.230
 because we have a big game that we can be known in the championship is very 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:56.739
 important for us to trust two concerts the attitude of repeating 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:00.129
 debates I think we did tonight normally I will not be long 

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:02.199
 moving this is not serious 

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:05.499
 the cacophony in the ranking still as a bottom-line solution would only be found 

00:03:05.499 --> 00:03:07.629
 others as a way of him 

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:09.599
 but not simple all the same kind of match 

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:12.599
 thank you for your time 

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:14.839
 how much is needed 

00:03:14.839 --> 00:03:17.269
 as soon as I join I find the rhythm 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:20.539
 I have a small wound a little tear of him being 

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:23.069
 she has them ssr 

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:26.409
 thanks to the injuries that handicaps not bad anyway 

00:03:26.409 --> 00:03:27.999
 in France the modem ansa 

00:03:27.999 --> 00:03:30.559
 so it's for this problem that we even skate tonight is a role 

00:03:30.559 --> 00:03:31.389
 positive 

00:03:31.389 --> 00:03:32.539
 I count on hand 

00:03:32.539 --> 00:03:33.919
 ap the team to win 

00:03:33.919 --> 00:03:37.029
 you've been a lot say why 

00:03:37.029 --> 00:03:38.949
 yeah not bad not bad 

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:41.679
 that's how it is necessary 

00:03:41.679 --> 00:03:43.369
 we must find again soon 

00:03:43.369 --> 00:03:46.809
 either I'm really trying on things more simply impossible I have not 

00:03:46.809 --> 00:03:48.639
 tried to 

00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:50.669
 the first risk and looters 

00:03:50.669 --> 00:03:53.719
 since the team won in business we did a good match 

00:03:55.389 --> 00:03:58.419
 many women and then it's still positive for us they must 

00:03:58.419 --> 00:04:02.269
 score on a brake 5 vs 3 16 is not seeing these things that are 

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:06.859
 it's really important to score in place for a derby there is a real 

00:04:06.859 --> 00:04:09.239
 group all matches 

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:11.719
 the three the sea in general we are happy to have 

00:04:11.719 --> 00:04:13.289
 the body 

00:04:13.289 --> 00:04:16.579
 jenkins I made a big game defensively 

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:19.579
 and then an atypical attacker what we like 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:23.620
 very nice action he was saying that could mean short after since 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:25.539
 early August 

00:04:25.539 --> 00:04:28.869
 it is clear that my sensitive soul even so many opportunities to mark where 

00:04:28.869 --> 00:04:30.580
 they had a 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:33.270
 they have an opportunity for let's say third third-time we were a 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:36.639
 little bit and he is attentive and foot then it pays cash and we 

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:38.210
 anticipate them 10 seconds 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:40.279
 it is a chance 

00:04:40.279 --> 00:04:43.379
 some clubs we say that we must however work them must shooter 

00:04:43.379 --> 00:04:45.580
 you have to make a world 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:49.139
 score brandon roy goals that are not good but are important and 

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:51.370
 and then yesterday after I think the ditty 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:52.379
 we are going to find 

00:04:52.379 --> 00:04:54.990
 any experienced agent m the year 2010 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:57.789
 a match like that to kigali at penalties 

00:04:57.789 --> 00:04:59.439
 in a in the current situation 

00:04:59.439 --> 00:05:00.589
 we are today 

00:05:00.589 --> 00:05:03.869
 what this important movement all spread of course and then where 

00:05:03.869 --> 00:05:06.059
 they are wax 

00:05:06.059 --> 00:05:09.789
 and before last episode the top of the rankings we really have to give us 

00:05:09.789 --> 00:05:11.309
 a little of their brilliance this room 

00:05:11.309 --> 00:05:13.520
 tonight we wanted to make a big game 

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:15.059
 rockstar good derby 

00:05:15.059 --> 00:05:17.839
 they have after a victory like that right there to understand what take 

00:05:17.839 --> 00:05:21.039
 it's already good for us in the rankings for trust 

00:05:21.039 --> 00:05:23.460
 by the way to go to 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:26.110
 vote 

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:26.990
