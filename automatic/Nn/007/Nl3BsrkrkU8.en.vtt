00:02:49.149 --> 00:02:49.159 
sculpted by Brian Fay I think they did a

00:02:49.159 --> 00:02:51.069 
sculpted by Brian Fay I think they did a
very<00:02:49.340> good<00:02:49.639> job<00:02:49.790> in<00:02:50.030> sculpting<00:02:50.540> these<00:02:50.659> figures

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:51.079 
very good job in sculpting these figures

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:52.930 
very good job in sculpting these figures
which<00:02:51.470> are<00:02:51.709> very<00:02:52.069> true<00:02:52.430> to<00:02:52.609> the<00:02:52.639> source

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
which are very true to the source

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.629 
which are very true to the source
material<00:02:53.120> on<00:02:53.659> which<00:02:53.900> they<00:02:54.139> are<00:02:54.170> based<00:02:54.639> the

00:02:55.629 --> 00:02:55.639 
material on which they are based the

00:02:55.639 --> 00:02:57.490 
material on which they are based the
head<00:02:55.819> sculpts<00:02:56.269> and<00:02:56.420> facial<00:02:56.690> expressions<00:02:57.319> are

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
head sculpts and facial expressions are

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.970 
head sculpts and facial expressions are
also<00:02:57.530> very<00:02:58.099> true<00:02:58.430> to<00:02:58.609> the<00:02:58.730> Jim<00:02:58.940> Lee<00:02:59.090> designs<00:02:59.510> I

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
also very true to the Jim Lee designs I

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.410 
also very true to the Jim Lee designs I
don't<00:03:00.980> know<00:03:01.159> if<00:03:01.340> you<00:03:01.489> will<00:03:01.639> agree<00:03:01.670> with<00:03:02.030> me<00:03:02.090> but

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420 
don't know if you will agree with me but

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.690 
don't know if you will agree with me but
I<00:03:02.480> think<00:03:02.599> the<00:03:03.590> sculpting<00:03:03.889> and<00:03:04.159> details<00:03:04.489> on

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
I think the sculpting and details on

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:06.610 
I think the sculpting and details on
this<00:03:04.849> figure<00:03:05.120> is<00:03:05.450> a<00:03:05.480> lot<00:03:05.810> better<00:03:06.049> than<00:03:06.379> their

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:06.620 
this figure is a lot better than their

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:09.640 
this figure is a lot better than their
Mattel<00:03:07.040> counterparts<00:03:07.849> I<00:03:08.139> also<00:03:09.139> like<00:03:09.500> the

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650 
Mattel counterparts I also like the

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:11.979 
Mattel counterparts I also like the
costume<00:03:10.010> details<00:03:10.430> with<00:03:10.819> recessed<00:03:11.269> areas<00:03:11.690> and

00:03:11.979 --> 00:03:11.989 
costume details with recessed areas and

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:14.409 
costume details with recessed areas and
the<00:03:12.620> new<00:03:12.799> Mandarin<00:03:13.129> color<00:03:13.519> that<00:03:13.910> features<00:03:14.389> a

00:03:14.409 --> 00:03:14.419 
the new Mandarin color that features a

00:03:14.419 --> 00:03:17.619 
the new Mandarin color that features a
more<00:03:14.900> modern<00:03:15.319> updated<00:03:15.919> look<00:03:16.250> as<00:03:16.699> compared<00:03:17.569> to

00:03:17.619 --> 00:03:17.629 
more modern updated look as compared to

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:20.319 
more modern updated look as compared to
their<00:03:17.810> classic<00:03:18.260> costume<00:03:18.650> design<00:03:19.010> I<00:03:19.250> have<00:03:20.209> to

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:20.329 
their classic costume design I have to

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:22.629 
their classic costume design I have to
admit<00:03:20.599> at<00:03:20.900> first<00:03:21.139> I<00:03:21.590> was<00:03:21.889> really<00:03:22.129> angry<00:03:22.400> and

00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:22.639 
admit at first I was really angry and

00:03:22.639 --> 00:03:24.909 
admit at first I was really angry and
upset<00:03:22.790> when<00:03:23.629> they<00:03:23.750> first<00:03:24.019> introduced<00:03:24.560> the<00:03:24.739> new

00:03:24.909 --> 00:03:24.919 
upset when they first introduced the new

00:03:24.919 --> 00:03:27.550 
upset when they first introduced the new
costume<00:03:25.579> but<00:03:26.359> now<00:03:26.510> I<00:03:26.540> seem<00:03:26.989> to<00:03:27.019> kind<00:03:27.319> of<00:03:27.410> like

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:27.560 
costume but now I seem to kind of like

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:31.599 
costume but now I seem to kind of like
it<00:03:28.000> the<00:03:29.000> paint<00:03:29.269> job<00:03:29.540> is<00:03:29.780> superb<00:03:30.410> I<00:03:30.709> really<00:03:31.430> like

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:31.609 
it the paint job is superb I really like

00:03:31.609 --> 00:03:33.580 
it the paint job is superb I really like
how<00:03:31.849> they<00:03:32.060> use<00:03:32.299> the<00:03:32.480> metallic<00:03:32.900> color<00:03:33.109> to<00:03:33.440> put

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:33.590 
how they use the metallic color to put

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:36.759 
how they use the metallic color to put
more<00:03:33.799> contrast<00:03:34.370> in<00:03:34.609> their<00:03:34.760> color<00:03:35.000> scheme<00:03:35.769> so

00:03:36.759 --> 00:03:36.769 
more contrast in their color scheme so

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:39.460 
more contrast in their color scheme so
far<00:03:37.010> I<00:03:37.250> don't<00:03:37.669> see<00:03:38.060> any<00:03:38.299> overspray<00:03:38.810> or<00:03:39.230> messy

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:39.470 
far I don't see any overspray or messy

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:46.050 
far I don't see any overspray or messy
areas<00:03:39.949> so<00:03:40.730> I<00:03:41.060> give<00:03:41.359> that<00:03:41.599> two<00:03:42.109> thumbs<00:03:42.379> up<00:03:43.569> and

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:46.060 
areas so I give that two thumbs up and

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:49.119 
areas so I give that two thumbs up and
the<00:03:47.060> downside<00:03:47.299> for<00:03:47.930> this<00:03:48.079> figures<00:03:48.500> is<00:03:48.799> the

00:03:49.119 --> 00:03:49.129 
the downside for this figures is the

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:52.390 
the downside for this figures is the
usual<00:03:49.579> issues<00:03:49.910> on<00:03:50.359> articulation<00:03:50.780> as<00:03:51.379> we<00:03:52.250> are

collectibles articulation is very

00:03:57.169 --> 00:04:00.309 
collectibles articulation is very

to say no more figure stands for all
figures<00:04:42.740> I<00:04:43.010> guess<00:04:43.699> it's<00:04:43.910> a<00:04:44.000> way<00:04:44.150> of

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:44.330

personal<00:05:07.430> preference<00:05:07.729> just<00:05:08.200> check<00:05:09.200> my<00:05:09.350> review

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:09.650 
personal preference just check my review

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:11.350 
personal preference just check my review
on<00:05:09.860> the<00:05:09.979> Superman<00:05:10.370> single<00:05:10.760> pack<00:05:10.940> action

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:11.360 
on the Superman single pack action

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:13.480 
on the Superman single pack action
figure<00:05:11.690> to<00:05:12.320> see<00:05:12.530> the<00:05:12.680> comparison

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:13.490 
figure to see the comparison

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:17.230 
figure to see the comparison
so<00:05:14.450> overall<00:05:15.050> the<00:05:15.979> lack<00:05:16.250> of<00:05:16.280> articulation<00:05:17.150> is

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:17.240 
so overall the lack of articulation is

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:19.659 
so overall the lack of articulation is
overruled<00:05:17.810> by<00:05:18.080> great<00:05:18.380> details<00:05:18.800> and<00:05:19.070> sculpting
