00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:05.940
 was the first game against Ghana 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.419
 so in training we already had man-course things my players were 

00:00:09.419 --> 00:00:11.989
 that many players are putting 

00:00:11.989 --> 00:00:14.169
 now year is filled 

00:00:14.169 --> 00:00:16.089
 he played 

00:00:16.089 --> 00:00:18.369
 Youth against experienced 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:21.249
 Furth in the case of heavy opponents ran Anna Mahr 

00:00:21.249 --> 00:00:24.249
 then from experiences 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:28.880
 Year she was no longer in training hunting for living together 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.880
 I also think for the trophy discount to see 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.990
 how to try the athleticism the different the docking of the transmitter 

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:38.520
 appears to compensate for so 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.520
 Clow both teams just he tries 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.790
 I personally watch the game so that it is not a little later that I bet 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:47.420
 yes still would have 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.420
 Paul something different for both sides 

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:55.270
 Pascal is now experienced German contribution is a role model for you 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:00.130
 In any case, year has already achieved a lot as a team played 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:02.600
 become champion with Frankfurt 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.670
 Vice-champion Dirksen meet the degree of maturity my size so he pulls 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:07.350
 Not 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.770
 many friends of the second time have to com this before 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.100
 there is one 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.100
 came out but definitely come 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:17.119
 I always find it 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:19.889
 PÃ¶lten very difficult to answer such questions I am yes then too 

00:01:19.889 --> 00:01:23.560
 Percent over no citizen has always been asked and will be outward 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.259
 In the end, that's how I want to be, but at the moment, that's the way it is 

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:31.109
 very difficult because every Poreda is trying to find his own style 

00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:33.720
 and and finding our own way to lead team 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.680
 and I think you can 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:39.050
 So I also went to Leutert SG, most of them Sigrid Pook 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:41.820
 maybe here and there something off or so you actually with them 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.840
 So from my own experience I necessarily have someone percent 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.170
 16 as a bird that you should operate with their higher but every player 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:51.810
 and Orfei where is there still trying to find his way and around 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.270
 At the same time he has a stain in another 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.970
 Case of a very solid in the case 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:00.490
 if it is at all like that but also in other clubs or in others 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:03.840
 Leagues for example and I think that's all very difficult so too 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.920
 from what we believe in his turn to pass 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.240
 there is a lot of what just happens on this position with the woman 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:12.660
 you can not learn otherwise you can not do that anymore 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.900
 Only other people make playing the future so you can only do that if you can 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.369
 Responsibility can be there on the 

00:02:18.369 --> 00:02:21.579
 personally highest possible level to the c-junior newspaper and then easy 

00:02:21.579 --> 00:02:24.859
 there is still trying to increase and with better players to measure and 

00:02:24.859 --> 00:02:25.719
 Glauburg 

00:02:25.719 --> 00:02:28.199
 that is always very very critical these questions become 

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:32.029
 Simon Greul had to make her alone with no name they also deserve big 

00:02:32.029 --> 00:02:35.879
 Respect for numbers from Daimler had also achieved but I think so 

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:36.679
 to have 

00:02:36.679 --> 00:02:39.679
 So he wants to go his way so a village that is also very good 

00:02:40.809 --> 00:02:42.659
 the aunt venues 

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:44.160
 4 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.580
 I think it was a successful form so led by Alois Dollar 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.839
 Costs have been welcomed 

00:02:49.839 --> 00:02:53.699
 but he has now been gone the band researchers from the PROGEN series like that 

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:56.039
 to classify is so 

00:02:56.039 --> 00:03:00.429
 two of us are playing i think the people are giving up the problems here and there 

00:03:00.429 --> 00:03:01.759
 we are us too 

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:03.569
 that you play well 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:07.759
 the word meaningful to the training camp Luther is a few 

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:11.129
 injured players had folders that our players are missing 

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:14.849
 Percent was not quite round but is different at the end with the 

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:16.679
 Tournament victory, of course 

00:03:16.679 --> 00:03:19.069
 to return to the positive sample i think about it 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:21.079
 plays around 2 11 

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:24.669
 two heavy opponents had hit over my and such one 

00:03:24.669 --> 00:03:27.169
 Team Oberes has often been in too much of a challenge
