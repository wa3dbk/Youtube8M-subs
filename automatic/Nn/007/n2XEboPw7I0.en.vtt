found in 2 minute I so extract isone 2
minutes<00:00:26.130> and<00:00:26.480> here's<00:00:27.480> a<00:00:27.570> problem<00:00:27.869> I<00:00:27.930> ran<00:00:28.109> into

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
minutes and here's a problem I ran into

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.910 
minutes and here's a problem I ran into
these<00:00:28.680> uh<00:00:29.000> included<00:00:30.000> all<00:00:30.090> these<00:00:30.240> shortcuts<00:00:30.920> to

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
these uh included all these shortcuts to

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.520 
these uh included all these shortcuts to
the<00:00:31.949> ocx<00:00:32.579> files<00:00:32.880> and<00:00:33.239> here<00:00:33.780> hit<00:00:33.989> properties

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
the ocx files and here hit properties

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.130 
the ocx files and here hit properties
and<00:00:34.860> change<00:00:35.730> to<00:00:35.969> the<00:00:36.059> path<00:00:36.270> wherever<00:00:36.600> your<00:00:36.719> EXI

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
and change to the path wherever your EXI

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.709 
and change to the path wherever your EXI
so<00:00:37.350> is<00:00:37.500> and<00:00:37.739> then<00:00:37.860> run<00:00:38.430> run<00:00:39.059> them<00:00:39.180> as<00:00:39.270> admins

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
so is and then run run them as admins

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.260 
so is and then run run them as admins
this<00:00:40.500> will<00:00:40.649> register<00:00:41.070> the<00:00:41.190> OC<00:00:41.460> X's<00:00:41.820> but<00:00:41.969> only

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
this will register the OC X's but only

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:43.760 
this will register the OC X's but only
do<00:00:42.510> this<00:00:42.629> if<00:00:42.809> it<00:00:42.899> isn't<00:00:43.140> working<00:00:43.410> to<00:00:43.500> begin

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:52.800 
to your JTAG if you have that set up I

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.070 
to your JTAG if you have that set up I
don't<00:01:53.550> really<00:01:53.670> use<00:01:53.850> X<00:01:54.060> I've<00:01:54.300> USB<00:01:54.690> hard<00:01:54.840> drive

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:55.080 
don't really use X I've USB hard drive

don't really use X I've USB hard drive
and<00:01:55.290> FTP<00:01:55.710> kind<00:01:56.040> of<00:01:56.130> slow<00:01:56.370> for<00:01:56.610> me

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:56.930 
and FTP kind of slow for me

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:59.860 
and FTP kind of slow for me
yeah<00:01:57.930> and<00:01:58.170> I<00:01:58.500> believe<00:01:58.950> you<00:01:59.010> can<00:01:59.040> also<00:01:59.250> create<00:01:59.490> a

00:01:59.860 --> 00:01:59.870 
yeah and I believe you can also create a

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:02.270 
yeah and I believe you can also create a
quick<00:02:00.870> boot<00:02:01.050> shortcuts<00:02:01.530> which<00:02:01.800> is<00:02:01.980> like<00:02:02.130> my

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
quick boot shortcuts which is like my

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.820 
quick boot shortcuts which is like my
last<00:02:02.490> video<00:02:02.820> but<00:02:03.060> I<00:02:03.540> don't<00:02:04.260> like<00:02:04.380> using<00:02:04.560> that

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:04.830 
last video but I don't like using that

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:06.920 
last video but I don't like using that
because<00:02:05.100> it's<00:02:05.250> kind<00:02:05.520> of<00:02:05.640> I<00:02:05.940> don't<00:02:06.690> know<00:02:06.750> like

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
because it's kind of I don't know like

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.240 
because it's kind of I don't know like
shortcut<00:02:07.350> 360<00:02:07.860> better

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
shortcut 360 better

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.670 
shortcut 360 better
now<00:02:08.940> I'm<00:02:09.090> gonna<00:02:09.210> fast-forward<00:02:09.660> through<00:02:10.080> this
