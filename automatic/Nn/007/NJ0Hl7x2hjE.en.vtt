00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
we haven't been able to run the boss we

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.810 
we haven't been able to run the boss we
had<00:00:39.300> to<00:00:39.390> do<00:00:39.540> something<00:00:40.460> obviously<00:00:41.460> he<00:00:41.610> goes

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
had to do something obviously he goes

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.069 
had to do something obviously he goes
for<00:00:43.160> 344<00:00:44.160> yards<00:00:44.360> probably<00:00:45.360> should<00:00:45.809> have<00:00:45.870> done

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
for 344 yards probably should have done

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.740 
for 344 yards probably should have done
it<00:00:46.230> for<00:00:46.379> years<00:00:46.620> ago<00:00:47.360> tremendous<00:00:48.360> football

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
it for years ago tremendous football

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:52.250 
player best guy on the field you know

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:54.439 
player best guy on the field you know
hindsight<00:00:53.250> obviously<00:00:53.489> should<00:00:54.149> have<00:00:54.270> done<00:00:54.420> a

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
hindsight obviously should have done a

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.790 
hindsight obviously should have done a
prior<00:00:54.930> to<00:00:55.110> this<00:00:55.199> but<00:00:55.530> felt<00:00:56.039> good<00:00:56.219> about<00:00:57.800> our

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
prior to this but felt good about our

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.349 
prior to this but felt good about our
running<00:00:59.160> back<00:00:59.309> situation<00:00:59.489> earlier<00:01:00.180> in<00:01:00.300> the

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
running back situation earlier in the

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.150 
running back situation earlier in the
year<00:01:00.390> I<00:01:00.840> felt<00:01:01.469> like<00:01:01.500> he<00:01:01.710> gave<00:01:01.920> us<00:01:02.039> some

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
year I felt like he gave us some

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.229 
year I felt like he gave us some
opportunities<00:01:02.699> for<00:01:02.820> this<00:01:02.910> matchup

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
opportunities for this matchup

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.600 
opportunities for this matchup
situations<00:01:04.110> they'll<00:01:04.350> get<00:01:04.589> small<00:01:04.830> to<00:01:05.040> them<00:01:05.189> as

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
situations they'll get small to them as

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.609 
situations they'll get small to them as
much<00:01:05.820> as<00:01:06.000> we<00:01:06.030> could<00:01:06.770> permanently<00:01:09.350> he<00:01:10.350> played<00:01:10.590> a

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
much as we could permanently he played a

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.950 
much as we could permanently he played a
lot<00:01:10.799> of<00:01:10.890> receiver<00:01:11.310> till<00:01:11.549> you<00:01:12.540> know<00:01:12.659> so<00:01:12.930> just

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
lot of receiver till you know so just

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.190 
lot of receiver till you know so just
moving<00:01:13.650> him<00:01:13.799> around<00:01:14.299> giving<00:01:15.299> him<00:01:15.450> different

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
moving him around giving him different

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.690 
moving him around giving him different
matchups<00:01:16.380> obviously<00:01:17.100> probably<00:01:17.490> a<00:01:17.520> pretty

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
matchups obviously probably a pretty

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.960 
matchups obviously probably a pretty
good<00:01:17.909> idea<00:01:19.520> Nadel<00:01:20.520> wasn't<00:01:20.759> something<00:01:20.880> that

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
good idea Nadel wasn't something that

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.820 
good idea Nadel wasn't something that
was<00:01:21.060> a<00:01:21.180> small<00:01:21.450> package<00:01:21.869> that<00:01:22.080> you<00:01:22.380> guys<00:01:22.560> just

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
was a small package that you guys just

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.649 
was a small package that you guys just
thought<00:01:23.040> the<00:01:23.250> row<00:01:23.759> because<00:01:24.060> it<00:01:24.180> were<00:01:24.270> still<00:01:24.330> in

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
thought the row because it were still in

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:25.789 
thought the row because it were still in
the<00:01:24.720> game<00:01:24.840> was<00:01:25.110> that<00:01:25.229> kind<00:01:25.350> of<00:01:25.500> played<00:01:25.680> all

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
the game was that kind of played all

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.320 
the game was that kind of played all
those<00:01:25.950> I'm<00:01:26.250> certain<00:01:26.580> my<00:01:26.610> group<00:01:26.850> was<00:01:27.060> that

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
those I'm certain my group was that

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:28.399 
those I'm certain my group was that
something<00:01:27.540> that<00:01:27.630> was<00:01:27.810> just<00:01:27.840> a<00:01:28.020> small<00:01:28.259> idea

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
something that was just a small idea

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:29.539 
something that was just a small idea
that<00:01:28.710> grew<00:01:28.799> during<00:01:29.009> the<00:01:29.159> game<00:01:29.310> where<00:01:29.430> was<00:01:29.520> that

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
that grew during the game where was that

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:30.440 
that grew during the game where was that
kind<00:01:29.759> of<00:01:29.880> a

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
kind of a

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.399 
kind of a
now<00:01:31.280> obviously<00:01:32.280> it<00:01:32.789> depends<00:01:33.750> on<00:01:33.960> how<00:01:34.110> the<00:01:34.170> game

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
now obviously it depends on how the game

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.709 
now obviously it depends on how the game
goes<00:01:34.649> and<00:01:34.979> we<00:01:35.340> had<00:01:35.729> a<00:01:35.759> package<00:01:36.240> that<00:01:36.270> we<00:01:36.539> could

00:01:36.709 --> 00:01:36.719 
goes and we had a package that we could

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:39.499 
goes and we had a package that we could
do<00:01:36.840> it<00:01:36.930> with<00:01:37.110> and<00:01:37.380> the<00:01:38.280> ability<00:01:39.060> to<00:01:39.149> be<00:01:39.299> able<00:01:39.360> to

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
do it with and the ability to be able to

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.179 
do it with and the ability to be able to
do<00:01:39.630> it<00:01:39.750> some<00:01:39.960> other<00:01:40.020> packages<00:01:40.679> presentable

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
do it some other packages presentable

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:42.830 
do it some other packages presentable
itself<00:01:41.640> just<00:01:42.149> because<00:01:42.299> that's<00:01:42.390> the<00:01:42.539> nature<00:01:42.719> of

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
itself just because that's the nature of

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.260 
itself just because that's the nature of
the<00:01:42.990> offense<00:01:43.380> so<00:01:43.789> obviously<00:01:44.789> when<00:01:44.939> you<00:01:45.000> get<00:01:45.149> it

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
the offense so obviously when you get it

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:46.639 
the offense so obviously when you get it
to<00:01:45.390> them<00:01:45.450> like<00:01:45.659> that<00:01:45.689> that<00:01:46.049> looks<00:01:46.229> as<00:01:46.380> good<00:01:46.409> as

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
to them like that that looks as good as

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.710 
to them like that that looks as good as
it<00:01:46.770> does<00:01:46.920> yeah<00:01:47.310> you<00:01:47.909> do<00:01:48.060> it<00:01:48.179> a<00:01:48.210> couple<00:01:48.420> other

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
it does yeah you do it a couple other

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:56.959 
it does yeah you do it a couple other
sets<00:01:49.049> as<00:01:49.229> well<00:01:54.950> three-point<00:01:55.950> play<00:01:56.189> geo<00:01:56.700> gets

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
sets as well three-point play geo gets

we can't do that you know and we were

00:03:54.639 --> 00:03:55.979 
we can't do that you know and we were
probably<00:03:54.849> a<00:03:55.000> little<00:03:55.150> slow<00:03:55.450> again<00:03:55.569> the<00:03:55.810> two

00:03:55.979 --> 00:03:55.989 
probably a little slow again the two

00:03:55.989 --> 00:03:57.629
