00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
then stabilized i'm using straight shot

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:25.180 
then stabilized i'm using straight shot
the<00:01:18.509> whole<00:01:18.630> time

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:25.190 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:36.430 

I<00:01:33.760> just<00:01:34.760> seen<00:01:35.000> Cabot's<00:01:35.840> got<00:01:36.110> a<00:01:36.140> bit<00:01:36.320> to

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:36.440 
I just seen Cabot's got a bit to

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:39.760 
I just seen Cabot's got a bit to
stabilize<00:01:36.950> then<00:01:37.240> and<00:01:38.290> now<00:01:39.290> we're<00:01:39.500> going<00:01:39.650> to

stabilize then and now we're going to

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:43.740 
stabilize then and now we're going to
exaggerate<00:01:40.220> its<00:01:40.610> to<00:01:40.760> stabilization<00:01:41.320> with<00:01:42.320> a

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:43.750 
exaggerate its to stabilization with a

00:01:43.750 --> 00:02:13.390 
exaggerate its to stabilization with a
sharp<00:01:44.750> tip<00:01:45.080> oh<00:01:51.460> ok<00:02:10.540> straight-cut<00:02:12.160> soco<00:02:13.160> went

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
sharp tip oh ok straight-cut soco went

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:36.760 
sharp tip oh ok straight-cut soco went
to<00:02:13.490> the<00:02:13.580> floor<00:02:13.760> log<00:02:17.020> do<00:02:18.020> that<00:02:18.170> again

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:36.770 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:39.440 

just<00:02:37.770> to<00:02:37.890> know<00:02:38.040> i<00:02:38.070> am<00:02:38.490> not<00:02:38.760> looking<00:02:38.970> quite<00:02:39.270> so

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
just to know i am not looking quite so

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.720 
just to know i am not looking quite so
cool<00:02:39.630> about<00:02:39.780> four<00:02:40.140> pounds<00:02:40.350> don't<00:02:41.220> want<00:02:41.400> it<00:02:41.550> to

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
cool about four pounds don't want it to

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:49.180 
cool about four pounds don't want it to
start<00:02:42.380> hanging<00:02:43.380> about<00:02:43.560> on<00:02:43.710> the<00:02:43.800> 20<00:02:44.160> village

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.190 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:52.730 

there<00:02:50.190> you<00:02:50.310> go<00:02:50.460> is<00:02:50.640> better<00:02:50.880> stabilized<00:02:51.740> will

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:52.740 
there you go is better stabilized will

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:57.860 
there you go is better stabilized will
exaggerate<00:02:53.040> it<00:02:53.430> furthermore<00:02:56.210> with<00:02:57.210> this<00:02:57.690> is

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
exaggerate it furthermore with this is

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:59.420 
exaggerate it furthermore with this is
the<00:02:58.050> better<00:02:58.200> one<00:02:58.380> to<00:02:58.560> show<00:02:58.740> it<00:02:58.920> because<00:02:59.100> it

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
the better one to show it because it

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.460 
the better one to show it because it
doesn't<00:02:59.700> always<00:02:59.880> work<00:03:00.210> with<00:03:00.480> the<00:03:00.630> s-type<00:03:00.990> even

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
doesn't always work with the s-type even

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.740 
doesn't always work with the s-type even
our<00:03:01.620> had<00:03:01.890> a<00:03:01.920> really<00:03:02.160> awesome<00:03:02.400> one<00:03:02.760> where<00:03:03.000> you

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
our had a really awesome one where you

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:17.480 
our had a really awesome one where you
can<00:03:03.780> make<00:03:04.080> some<00:03:04.290> like<00:03:04.440> that<00:03:04.620> earlier<00:03:16.490> that's

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:17.490 
can make some like that earlier that's

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:36.470 
can make some like that earlier that's
about<00:03:18.380> seventy<00:03:19.380> percent<00:03:19.440> our<00:03:34.310> yeah<00:03:35.310> they<00:03:36.270> go

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
about seventy percent our yeah they go

00:03:36.480 --> 00:04:04.450 
about seventy percent our yeah they go
um<00:03:36.780> i'll<00:03:37.530> do<00:03:37.710> that<00:03:37.860> again<00:03:47.060> really<00:03:48.060> okay

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 
now that's what you call a full screen

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:14.960 
now that's what you call a full screen
when<00:04:06.960> you<00:04:07.050> get<00:04:07.200> it<00:04:07.320> at<00:04:07.620> 125<00:04:08.310> dealer<00:04:13.970> that's

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970 
when you get it at 125 dealer that's

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:19.240 
when you get it at 125 dealer that's
life<00:04:15.210> after<00:04:15.540> death<00:04:15.690> so<00:04:16.260> it's<00:04:16.440> one<00:04:16.769> that<00:04:17.010> just
