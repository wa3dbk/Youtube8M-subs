pretty cool allows out hunting today I
got<00:00:09.820> a<00:00:09.850> few<00:00:10.090> signals<00:00:10.510> that<00:00:12.120> they<00:00:13.120> didn't<00:00:13.390> sound

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:13.540 
got a few signals that they didn't sound

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:15.720 
got a few signals that they didn't sound
very<00:00:13.690> good<00:00:13.960> at<00:00:14.320> all<00:00:14.500> but<00:00:15.190> when<00:00:15.400> I<00:00:15.430> went<00:00:15.670> to

very good at all but when I went to

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:20.819 
very good at all but when I went to
pinpoint<00:00:17.160> it<00:00:18.160> would<00:00:18.930> pinpoint<00:00:19.930> a<00:00:20.260> good<00:00:20.500> target

00:00:20.819 --> 00:00:20.829 
pinpoint it would pinpoint a good target

00:00:20.829 --> 00:00:23.550 
pinpoint it would pinpoint a good target
or<00:00:21.220> it<00:00:21.369> would<00:00:21.489> build<00:00:21.759> a<00:00:22.239> good<00:00:22.750> target<00:00:23.050> in<00:00:23.349> here

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:23.560 
or it would build a good target in here

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:25.050 
or it would build a good target in here
I'll<00:00:23.860> show<00:00:24.160> you<00:00:24.220> what<00:00:24.340> I<00:00:24.400> mean<00:00:24.550> like<00:00:24.759> right

the screen is trying to hit up in here

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:39.870 
the screen is trying to hit up in here
somewhere<00:00:36.970> too<00:00:37.180> so<00:00:37.510> I<00:00:38.520> mean<00:00:39.520> if<00:00:39.640> you're<00:00:39.760> at

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:41.620 
pinpoint you know you don't have any

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:50.360 
pinpoint you know you don't have any
indication<00:00:42.130> that's<00:00:42.190> a<00:00:42.310> good<00:00:42.460> target<00:00:42.700> there

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.980 

those<00:00:51.370> up<00:00:51.640> builds<00:00:52.090> a<00:00:52.180> good<00:00:52.330> target<00:00:52.600> right<00:00:52.870> in

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:52.990 
those up builds a good target right in

00:00:52.990 --> 00:01:24.660 
those up builds a good target right in
there<00:01:19.590> if<00:01:20.590> you're<00:01:20.740> just<00:01:20.920> going<00:01:21.100> by<00:01:21.249> sound<00:01:23.670> but

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:24.670 
there if you're just going by sound but

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:26.669 
there if you're just going by sound but
notice<00:01:24.999> the<00:01:25.090> numbers<00:01:25.420> are<00:01:25.600> it's<00:01:26.079> it<00:01:26.289> what<00:01:26.590> it

00:01:26.669 --> 00:01:26.679 
notice the numbers are it's it what it

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:30.059 
notice the numbers are it's it what it
is<00:01:26.770> is<00:01:26.920> a<00:01:26.950> copper<00:01:27.369> penny<00:01:27.549> and<00:01:27.759> a<00:01:27.819> nail<00:01:28.030> so<00:01:29.069> if

00:01:30.059 --> 00:01:30.069 
is is a copper penny and a nail so if

00:01:30.069 --> 00:01:31.830 
is is a copper penny and a nail so if
you<00:01:30.219> look<00:01:30.340> at<00:01:30.429> the<00:01:30.520> numbers<00:01:30.909> is<00:01:31.210> trying<00:01:31.630> to<00:01:31.689> hit

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:31.840 
you look at the numbers is trying to hit

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.239 
you look at the numbers is trying to hit
on<00:01:31.960> a<00:01:31.990> good<00:01:32.259> good<00:01:32.679> number

00:01:33.239 --> 00:01:33.249 
on a good good number

00:01:33.249 --> 00:01:35.819 
on a good good number
there's<00:01:34.209> also<00:01:34.389> hitting<00:01:34.780> the<00:01:34.899> nail<00:01:35.109> down<00:01:35.380> here

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:35.829 
there's also hitting the nail down here

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:38.609 
there's also hitting the nail down here
let's<00:01:36.549> see<00:01:36.639> if<00:01:36.729> you<00:01:36.850> and<00:01:37.539> your<00:01:37.689> pinpoint<00:01:38.229> it

00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:38.619 
let's see if you and your pinpoint it

00:01:38.619 --> 00:02:05.510 
let's see if you and your pinpoint it
recognizes<00:01:39.219> that<00:01:39.249> penny<00:01:39.609> what

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.770 

not<00:02:06.520> very<00:02:06.729> good<00:02:06.939> reading<00:02:07.179> within<00:02:07.600> when<00:02:07.720> you

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:07.780 
not very good reading within when you

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:15.990 
not very good reading within when you
pinpoint<00:02:14.040> see<00:02:15.040> it<00:02:15.130> put<00:02:15.340> something<00:02:15.790> up<00:02:15.849> here

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
pinpoint see it put something up here

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.220 
pinpoint see it put something up here
let<00:02:16.209> you<00:02:16.330> know<00:02:16.450> there's<00:02:16.660> possibly<00:02:16.989> a<00:02:17.050> good

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
let you know there's possibly a good

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:22.140 
let you know there's possibly a good
target<00:02:17.470> they're<00:02:20.580> definitely<00:02:21.580> quite<00:02:21.940> a<00:02:21.970> few

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
target they're definitely quite a few

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.330 
target they're definitely quite a few
time<00:02:22.330> today<00:02:22.540> where<00:02:22.840> it<00:02:23.560> didn't<00:02:23.799> sound<00:02:24.010> good

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
time today where it didn't sound good

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.460 
time today where it didn't sound good
but<00:02:24.700> there<00:02:25.480> did<00:02:25.630> something<00:02:25.900> on<00:02:25.930> the<00:02:26.049> screen<00:02:26.230> is

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470

almost<00:02:39.610> set<00:02:39.760> up<00:02:39.849> some<00:02:40.030> discrimination<00:02:40.680> see<00:02:41.680> if

00:02:41.759 --> 00:02:41.769 
almost set up some discrimination see if

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:50.840 
almost set up some discrimination see if
it'll<00:02:45.510> see<00:02:46.510> if<00:02:46.599> it'll<00:02:46.780> still<00:02:47.769> work<00:02:47.799> like<00:02:48.160> it

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:56.819 

it's<00:02:51.850> a<00:02:51.940> program<00:02:52.180> I<00:02:52.510> made<00:02:52.720> right<00:02:52.989> here<00:02:53.230> so<00:02:55.829> got

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:56.829 
it's a program I made right here so got

00:02:56.829 --> 00:03:03.630 
it's a program I made right here so got
some<00:02:57.010> discrimination<00:03:01.859> not<00:03:02.859> very<00:03:03.160> good<00:03:03.340> signal

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:03.640 
some discrimination not very good signal

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:12.150 
some discrimination not very good signal
or<00:03:03.940> hardly<00:03:04.180> any<00:03:04.269> signal<00:03:05.069> way<00:03:06.069> at<00:03:06.190> pinpoint<00:03:11.160> it

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:12.160 
or hardly any signal way at pinpoint it

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:30.449 
or hardly any signal way at pinpoint it
builds<00:03:12.609> a<00:03:12.700> good<00:03:12.910> signal<00:03:13.569> right<00:03:13.690> there<00:03:29.459> he's

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:30.459 
builds a good signal right there he's

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:32.400 
builds a good signal right there he's
hitting<00:03:30.730> both<00:03:31.060> the<00:03:31.299> junk<00:03:31.630> and<00:03:31.930> the<00:03:32.049> good<00:03:32.260> one

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:36.670 
we lift the coil a little bit about six

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:51.949 
we lift the coil a little bit about six
inches

about six inches off the ground it's
pretty<00:04:03.220> cool<00:04:03.459> you<00:04:03.640> know<00:04:03.700> you<00:04:03.850> don't<00:04:03.940> have<00:04:04.090> a

pretty cool you know you don't have a
very<00:04:04.270> good<00:04:04.360> signal<00:04:04.630> it<00:04:04.840> still<00:04:05.050> giving<00:04:05.260> you

00:04:05.309 --> 00:04:05.319 
very good signal it still giving you

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:09.209
