called the answer as always will be
given<00:00:38.160> at<00:00:38.250> the<00:00:38.370> end<00:00:39.620> from<00:00:40.620> a<00:00:40.680> ghost<00:00:40.890> plot<00:00:41.129> we

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
given at the end from a ghost plot we

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.979 
given at the end from a ghost plot we
can<00:00:41.430> see<00:00:41.579> that<00:00:41.790> since<00:00:42.090> we<00:00:42.239> last<00:00:42.390> time<00:00:42.629> we<00:00:42.780> met

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
can see that since we last time we met

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.680 
can see that since we last time we met
we've<00:00:43.200> had<00:00:43.379> for<00:00:43.710> Morsi<00:00:44.309> flares<00:00:44.640> and<00:00:44.910> of<00:00:45.450> course

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
we've had for Morsi flares and of course

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.279 
we've had for Morsi flares and of course
this<00:00:45.989> M<00:00:46.230> flare<00:00:46.640> this<00:00:47.640> was<00:00:47.789> an<00:00:47.879> M<00:00:48.059> 9.3<00:00:48.989> flare

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
this M flare this was an M 9.3 flare

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:50.690 
this M flare this was an M 9.3 flare
although<00:00:49.590> it<00:00:49.829> doesn't<00:00:50.039> look<00:00:50.250> like<00:00:50.309> it<00:00:50.610> from

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
although it doesn't look like it from

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:51.860 
although it doesn't look like it from
this<00:00:50.850> plot<00:00:51.090> but<00:00:51.270> this<00:00:51.360> is<00:00:51.480> a<00:00:51.510> five-minute

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
this plot but this is a five-minute

this plot but this is a five-minute
average<00:00:52.500> clock<00:00:52.800> if<00:00:53.280> you<00:00:53.370> look<00:00:53.489> at<00:00:53.579> the<00:00:53.640> higher

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
time resolution data it goes all the way

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.389 
time resolution data it goes all the way
up<00:00:55.649> to<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:56.420> 9.3<00:00:57.530> so<00:00:58.530> if<00:00:58.649> it<00:00:58.739> only<00:00:58.890> just<00:00:59.070> been

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
up to the 9.3 so if it only just been

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.670 
up to the 9.3 so if it only just been
seven<00:00:59.730> percent<00:01:00.059> brighter<00:01:00.480> then<00:01:01.289> we<00:01:01.500> would

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
seven percent brighter then we would

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.579 
seven percent brighter then we would
have<00:01:01.800> had<00:01:01.949> our<00:01:01.980> first<00:01:02.309> x-ray<00:01:02.730> er<00:01:02.760> since<00:01:03.000> March

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:03.589 
have had our first x-ray er since March

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:05.719 
have had our first x-ray er since March
but<00:01:04.589> the<00:01:04.650> other<00:01:04.769> thing<00:01:04.920> to<00:01:05.040> notice<00:01:05.220> here<00:01:05.369> is

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
but the other thing to notice here is

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.690 
but the other thing to notice here is
that<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.479> background<00:01:06.659> is<00:01:07.049> decreasing<00:01:07.580> so<00:01:08.580> it

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
that the background is decreasing so it

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:09.890 
that the background is decreasing so it
seems<00:01:08.880> that<00:01:09.060> some<00:01:09.270> of<00:01:09.330> these<00:01:09.420> regions<00:01:09.780> are

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
seems that some of these regions are

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.260 
seems that some of these regions are
simplifying<00:01:10.470> or<00:01:11.430> at<00:01:11.610> least<00:01:11.729> becoming<00:01:12.090> less

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
simplifying or at least becoming less

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.390 
simplifying or at least becoming less

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:36.490 
large region with two huge spots but

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:39.600 
large region with two huge spots but
seems<00:01:36.760> to<00:01:36.850> be<00:01:36.970> stable<00:01:38.070> there<00:01:39.070> is<00:01:39.190> a<00:01:39.220> new<00:01:39.430> region

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:39.610

propping<00:01:40.120> up<00:01:40.180> it<00:01:40.360> to<00:01:40.570> the<00:01:40.690> west<00:01:40.900> of<00:01:41.100> 1260

propping up it to the west of 1260

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.010 
propping up it to the west of 1260
that's<00:01:42.610> been<00:01:42.850> growing<00:01:42.970> quite<00:01:43.270> rapidly<00:01:43.330> I

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:44.020 
that's been growing quite rapidly I

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:45.480 
that's been growing quite rapidly I
think<00:01:44.530> it's<00:01:44.650> the<00:01:44.710> REE<00:01:44.830> emergence<00:01:45.250> of<00:01:45.340> those

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:45.490 
think it's the REE emergence of those

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:46.890 
think it's the REE emergence of those
small<00:01:45.790> spots<00:01:46.119> that<00:01:46.240> I<00:01:46.330> was<00:01:46.450> talking<00:01:46.570> about<00:01:46.750> a

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:46.900 
small spots that I was talking about a

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:49.200 
small spots that I was talking about a
couple<00:01:47.229> of<00:01:47.320> days<00:01:47.440> ago<00:01:47.670> so<00:01:48.670> that<00:01:48.820> is<00:01:48.940> an<00:01:49.060> area

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:49.210 
couple of days ago so that is an area

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:52.410 
couple of days ago so that is an area
worth<00:01:49.450> keeping<00:01:49.780> an<00:01:49.869> eye<00:01:50.020> on<00:01:50.880> in<00:01:51.880> the<00:01:52.000> sunspot

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:52.420 
worth keeping an eye on in the sunspot

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:54.240 
worth keeping an eye on in the sunspot
movie<00:01:52.690> from<00:01:52.810> 8am<00:01:53.110> I<00:01:53.350> of<00:01:53.680> course<00:01:53.860> I<00:01:54.010> would<00:01:54.130> like

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:54.250 
movie from 8am I of course I would like

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:56.040 
movie from 8am I of course I would like
you<00:01:54.369> to<00:01:54.460> keep<00:01:54.610> an<00:01:54.760> eye<00:01:54.880> on<00:01:54.910> the<00:01:55.119> region<00:01:55.450> 1261

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:56.050 
you to keep an eye on the region 1261

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:58.469 
you to keep an eye on the region 1261
look<00:01:56.950> how<00:01:57.040> it<00:01:57.190> changes<00:01:57.490> shape<00:01:57.550> over<00:01:57.970> the<00:01:58.060> 48

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:58.479 
look how it changes shape over the 48

00:01:58.479 --> 00:01:59.940 
look how it changes shape over the 48
hours<00:01:58.840> starting<00:01:59.259> out<00:01:59.380> as<00:01:59.500> a<00:01:59.590> relatively

00:01:59.940 --> 00:01:59.950 
hours starting out as a relatively

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:01.859 
hours starting out as a relatively
linear<00:02:00.310> region<00:02:00.490> and<00:02:01.060> then<00:02:01.180> ending<00:02:01.479> up<00:02:01.570> as<00:02:01.810> a

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:01.869 
linear region and then ending up as a

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:04.260 
linear region and then ending up as a
horseshoe<00:02:02.700> however<00:02:03.700> if<00:02:03.790> we<00:02:03.910> look<00:02:04.060> at<00:02:04.180> the

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
horseshoe however if we look at the

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:06.180 
horseshoe however if we look at the
region<00:02:04.630> in<00:02:04.750> detail<00:02:04.780> we<00:02:05.320> can<00:02:05.470> see<00:02:05.590> a<00:02:05.619> very<00:02:05.860> rare

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:06.190 
region in detail we can see a very rare

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:08.940 
region in detail we can see a very rare
phenomenon<00:02:06.729> a<00:02:06.820> white<00:02:07.119> light<00:02:07.390> flare<00:02:07.840> keep<00:02:08.800> your

eye on a spot above the Green Line and

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:12.360 
eye on a spot above the Green Line and
to<00:02:11.080> see<00:02:11.230> a<00:02:11.260> flash<00:02:11.500> at<00:02:11.650> about<00:02:11.830> the<00:02:11.920> time<00:02:11.950> of<00:02:12.130> the

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
to see a flash at about the time of the

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:16.949 
to see a flash at about the time of the
flare<00:02:13.950> that's<00:02:14.950> a<00:02:15.040> white<00:02:15.220> light<00:02:15.400> flare<00:02:15.959> it's

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:16.959 
flare that's a white light flare it's

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:17.790 
flare that's a white light flare it's
very<00:02:17.020> much<00:02:17.230> the<00:02:17.290> sort<00:02:17.560> of<00:02:17.590> thing<00:02:17.770> that

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
very much the sort of thing that

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.010 
very much the sort of thing that
Carrington<00:02:18.340> saw<00:02:18.489> in<00:02:18.640> 1859<00:02:19.239> when<00:02:19.630> he<00:02:19.690> sold<00:02:19.930> the

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:20.020 
Carrington saw in 1859 when he sold the

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:22.380 
Carrington saw in 1859 when he sold the
first<00:02:20.170> flare<00:02:20.550> although<00:02:21.550> this<00:02:21.820> one<00:02:22.060> was<00:02:22.209> much

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
first flare although this one was much

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:26.280 
first flare although this one was much
smaller<00:02:22.720> of<00:02:23.020> course

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290

the<00:02:26.799> magnetic<00:02:27.310> movie<00:02:27.610> probably<00:02:28.599> those

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
the magnetic movie probably those

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:30.240 
the magnetic movie probably those
interesting<00:02:29.200> thing<00:02:29.379> is<00:02:29.560> the<00:02:29.709> development<00:02:30.129> of

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
interesting thing is the development of

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:31.800 
interesting thing is the development of
these<00:02:30.400> three<00:02:30.640> regions<00:02:31.030> with<00:02:31.150> respect<00:02:31.569> to<00:02:31.659> one

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
these three regions with respect to one

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:35.250 
these three regions with respect to one
another

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:36.690 

turn<00:02:35.890> me<00:02:35.980> out<00:02:36.040> to<00:02:36.310> the<00:02:36.400> solar<00:02:36.610> atmosphere

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
turn me out to the solar atmosphere

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.309 
turn me out to the solar atmosphere
let's<00:02:37.360> take<00:02:37.480> a<00:02:37.540> look<00:02:37.689> at<00:02:37.720> the<00:02:37.840> transition

00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:38.319 
let's take a look at the transition

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:41.039 
let's take a look at the transition
region<00:02:38.439> movie<00:02:38.920> and<00:02:39.129> here<00:02:39.730> although<00:02:40.000> the<00:02:40.239> xfer

00:02:41.039 --> 00:02:41.049 
region movie and here although the xfer

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:42.179 
region movie and here although the xfer
is<00:02:41.200> interesting<00:02:41.620> I<00:02:41.680> would<00:02:41.799> like<00:02:41.890> you<00:02:41.950> to<00:02:42.099> keep

00:02:42.179 --> 00:02:42.189 
is interesting I would like you to keep

00:02:42.189 --> 00:02:44.190 
is interesting I would like you to keep
an<00:02:42.340> eye<00:02:42.459> on<00:02:42.489> the<00:02:42.700> two<00:02:42.849> prominences<00:02:43.390> on<00:02:43.629> the

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200 
an eye on the two prominences on the

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:45.780 
an eye on the two prominences on the
west<00:02:44.409> slim<00:02:44.680> one<00:02:44.980> in<00:02:45.099> the<00:02:45.159> north<00:02:45.340> and<00:02:45.549> one<00:02:45.670> in

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
west slim one in the north and one in

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:47.670 
west slim one in the north and one in
the<00:02:45.819> safe<00:02:46.140> they<00:02:47.140> look<00:02:47.290> as<00:02:47.409> though<00:02:47.530> they're

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
the safe they look as though they're

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.589 
the safe they look as though they're
about<00:02:47.860> ready<00:02:47.920> to<00:02:48.159> lift<00:02:48.400> off<00:02:48.610> so<00:02:49.390> we<00:02:49.480> should

00:02:49.589 --> 00:02:49.599 
about ready to lift off so we should

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:51.119 
about ready to lift off so we should
keep<00:02:49.720> an<00:02:49.870> eye<00:02:49.959> on<00:02:49.989> those<00:02:50.200> over<00:02:50.500> the<00:02:50.590> next<00:02:50.799> 24

00:02:51.119 --> 00:02:51.129 
keep an eye on those over the next 24

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:57.750 
keep an eye on those over the next 24
hours<00:02:51.159> and<00:02:51.489> see<00:02:51.670> if<00:02:51.760> they<00:02:51.940> do<00:02:56.670> here's<00:02:57.670> a

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
hours and see if they do here's a

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.210 
hours and see if they do here's a
detailed<00:02:58.120> movie<00:02:58.329> of<00:02:58.480> the<00:02:58.569> M<00:02:58.810> flare<00:02:59.230> seen<00:02:59.920> in

detailed movie of the M flare seen in
helium<00:03:00.640> 2<00:03:00.879> 304<00:03:01.950> you<00:03:02.950> can<00:03:03.099> see<00:03:03.190> there's<00:03:03.340> a<00:03:03.400> small

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670 
helium 2 304 you can see there's a small

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:05.190 
helium 2 304 you can see there's a small
eruption<00:03:04.120> just<00:03:04.329> to<00:03:04.390> the<00:03:04.480> south<00:03:04.689> and<00:03:04.870> west<00:03:05.019> of

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
eruption just to the south and west of

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.559 
eruption just to the south and west of
the<00:03:05.290> region<00:03:05.650> just<00:03:05.920> before<00:03:06.280> the<00:03:06.430> flare<00:03:06.670> however

00:03:07.559 --> 00:03:07.569 
the region just before the flare however

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:09.690 
the region just before the flare however
when<00:03:08.170> the<00:03:08.230> player<00:03:08.500> brightens<00:03:08.950> it<00:03:09.129> doesn't<00:03:09.609> it

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:09.700 
when the player brightens it doesn't it

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:11.399 
when the player brightens it doesn't it
be<00:03:09.819> any<00:03:09.970> major<00:03:10.209> eruption<00:03:10.720> within<00:03:11.019> the<00:03:11.140> event

00:03:11.399 --> 00:03:11.409 
be any major eruption within the event

00:03:11.409 --> 00:03:13.050 
be any major eruption within the event
so<00:03:11.620> once<00:03:11.829> again<00:03:11.950> we<00:03:12.280> shouldn't<00:03:12.549> be<00:03:12.609> expecting

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 
so once again we shouldn't be expecting

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:14.309 
so once again we shouldn't be expecting
to<00:03:13.180> see<00:03:13.359> a<00:03:13.389> major<00:03:13.659> coronal<00:03:14.139> mass<00:03:14.290> ejection

to see a major coronal mass ejection

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:17.540 
to see a major coronal mass ejection
from<00:03:14.920> this<00:03:15.129> event

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:26.580 
comparing the three regions now if you'd

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:29.060 
comparing the three regions now if you'd
said<00:03:27.120> that<00:03:27.330> region<00:03:27.720> 1261<00:03:28.320> was<00:03:28.800> the<00:03:28.890> most

active then indeed we might have had
some<00:03:31.110> harbinger<00:03:31.650> this<00:03:31.890> flare<00:03:32.190> but<00:03:33.120> I<00:03:33.180> didn't

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
some harbinger this flare but I didn't

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:36.560 
some harbinger this flare but I didn't
think<00:03:33.600> that<00:03:33.780> was<00:03:33.930> the<00:03:33.960> case<00:03:35.270> however<00:03:36.270> we<00:03:36.420> did

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:36.570 
think that was the case however we did

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:39.590 
think that was the case however we did
point<00:03:36.840> out<00:03:36.960> yesterday<00:03:37.530> that<00:03:37.560> region<00:03:38.460> 1261<00:03:39.120> was

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:39.600 
point out yesterday that region 1261 was

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.410 
point out yesterday that region 1261 was
increasing<00:03:40.260> in<00:03:40.380> this<00:03:40.500> level<00:03:40.830> of<00:03:40.920> activity

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:41.420 
increasing in this level of activity

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:43.700 
increasing in this level of activity
though<00:03:42.420> I<00:03:42.450> don't<00:03:42.720> think<00:03:42.870> any<00:03:43.020> of<00:03:43.140> us<00:03:43.260> predicted

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:43.710 
though I don't think any of us predicted

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:46.130 
though I don't think any of us predicted
the<00:03:43.830> next<00:03:44.100> player<00:03:44.310> or<00:03:45.210> even<00:03:45.420> a<00:03:45.510> large<00:03:45.720> empire

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:46.140 
the next player or even a large empire

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:48.830 
the next player or even a large empire
coming<00:03:46.530> into<00:03:46.680> this<00:03:46.830> region<00:03:47.390> the<00:03:48.390> larger

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
coming into this region the larger

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:52.040 
coming into this region the larger
region<00:03:49.260> behind<00:03:49.650> it<00:03:49.980> 1263<00:03:50.550> is<00:03:51.090> probably<00:03:51.720> the

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:52.050 
region behind it 1263 is probably the

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:53.840 
region behind it 1263 is probably the
better<00:03:52.230> candidate<00:03:52.770> for<00:03:52.950> that<00:03:52.980> whoever<00:03:53.700> that

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:53.850 
better candidate for that whoever that

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:55.520 
better candidate for that whoever that
is<00:03:53.910> stable<00:03:54.420> and<00:03:54.540> is<00:03:54.780> not<00:03:54.930> producing<00:03:55.260> any

flares in the two million degree coronal
movie<00:03:58.530> you<00:03:59.070> can<00:03:59.190> see<00:03:59.280> that<00:03:59.310> there's<00:03:59.580> a<00:03:59.640> new

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790 
movie you can see that there's a new

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:02.260 
movie you can see that there's a new
region<00:04:00.000> coming<00:04:00.480> over<00:04:00.660> the<00:04:00.780> South<00:04:00.990> East<00:04:01.350> limb

following<00:04:03.270> that<00:04:03.300> I<00:04:03.420> have<00:04:03.690> a<00:04:03.720> movie<00:04:03.960> in<00:04:04.200> an<00:04:04.320> even

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
following that I have a movie in an even

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:11.900 
fair itself here you can see an artifact
of<00:04:10.470> the<00:04:10.560> way<00:04:10.860> in<00:04:11.040> which<00:04:11.130> these<00:04:11.340> images<00:04:11.880> are

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:11.910 
of the way in which these images are

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:15.670 
of the way in which these images are
produced<00:04:12.810> in<00:04:13.370> using<00:04:14.370> multi<00:04:14.640> layer<00:04:14.820> optics

when<00:04:16.680> they<00:04:16.830> saturate<00:04:17.100> or<00:04:17.609> you<00:04:17.700> get<00:04:17.880> something

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
when they saturate or you get something

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:20.539 
when they saturate or you get something
very<00:04:18.359> bright<00:04:18.660> you<00:04:19.560> get<00:04:19.709> multiple<00:04:20.130> images

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:20.549 
very bright you get multiple images

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:22.070 
very bright you get multiple images
forming<00:04:21.090> further<00:04:21.390> and<00:04:21.600> further<00:04:21.720> away<00:04:21.959> from

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:29.610 
density of four protons per cubic

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:31.490 
density of four protons per cubic
centimeter<00:05:29.670> and<00:05:30.330> geo<00:05:31.020> space<00:05:31.260> conditions

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:31.500 
centimeter and geo space conditions

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:34.580 
centimeter and geo space conditions
remain<00:05:32.010> quiet<00:05:32.660> so<00:05:33.660> my<00:05:33.690> forecast<00:05:34.230> then<00:05:34.380> for<00:05:34.530> the

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:34.590 
remain quiet so my forecast then for the

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:36.470 
remain quiet so my forecast then for the
next<00:05:34.650> 24<00:05:35.040> hours<00:05:35.070> is<00:05:35.730> you<00:05:35.910> have<00:05:36.060> a<00:05:36.090> good<00:05:36.300> chance

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:36.480 
next 24 hours is you have a good chance

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:39.650 
next 24 hours is you have a good chance
of<00:05:36.600> getting<00:05:36.720> both<00:05:36.990> C&amp;M<00:05:37.500> players<00:05:37.860> and<00:05:38.660> there's

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:39.660 
of getting both C&amp;M players and there's

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:41.270 
of getting both C&amp;M players and there's
a<00:05:39.750> possibility<00:05:40.140> of<00:05:40.380> getting<00:05:40.470> x-rays<00:05:40.980> we<00:05:41.160> were

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:41.280 
a possibility of getting x-rays we were

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:43.040 
a possibility of getting x-rays we were
so<00:05:41.460> close<00:05:41.640> then<00:05:42.120> the<00:05:42.240> best<00:05:42.450> way<00:05:42.570> of<00:05:42.660> predicting

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:43.050 
so close then the best way of predicting

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:44.960 
so close then the best way of predicting
next<00:05:43.470> layer<00:05:43.650> is<00:05:44.100> that<00:05:44.340> we've<00:05:44.430> only<00:05:44.580> just<00:05:44.670> had

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:44.970 
next layer is that we've only just had

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:48.559 
next layer is that we've only just had
one<00:05:45.470> that's<00:05:46.470> what<00:05:46.620> number<00:05:46.860> will<00:05:46.980> remain<00:05:47.130> high

00:05:48.559 --> 00:05:48.569 
one that's what number will remain high

00:05:48.569 --> 00:05:50.089 
one that's what number will remain high
just<00:05:49.319> getting<00:05:49.589> a<00:05:49.649> coronal<00:05:49.949> mass<00:05:49.979> ejection

00:05:50.089 --> 00:05:50.099 
just getting a coronal mass ejection

00:05:50.099 --> 00:05:54.200 
just getting a coronal mass ejection
remains<00:05:50.819> good<00:05:52.309> solar<00:05:53.309> wind<00:05:53.490> speed<00:05:53.819> will<00:05:54.059> go

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:54.210 
remains good solar wind speed will go

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:57.079 
remains good solar wind speed will go
higher<00:05:54.539> and<00:05:55.399> the<00:05:56.399> chance<00:05:56.639> of<00:05:56.729> getting<00:05:56.789> a

00:05:57.079 --> 00:05:57.089 
higher and the chance of getting a

00:05:57.089 --> 00:06:00.709 
higher and the chance of getting a
geomagnetic<00:05:57.479> storm<00:05:57.629> is<00:05:58.110> very<00:05:58.289> remote<00:05:59.629> in<00:06:00.629> a

00:06:00.709 --> 00:06:00.719 
geomagnetic storm is very remote in a

00:06:00.719 --> 00:06:02.809 
geomagnetic storm is very remote in a
slightly<00:06:00.959> longer<00:06:01.169> term<00:06:01.559> there's<00:06:02.429> nothing<00:06:02.729> to

00:06:02.809 --> 00:06:02.819 
slightly longer term there's nothing to

00:06:02.819 --> 00:06:04.519 
slightly longer term there's nothing to
you<00:06:02.849> over<00:06:03.119> the<00:06:03.149> East<00:06:03.599> limb<00:06:03.869> for<00:06:04.110> at<00:06:04.229> least<00:06:04.289> two

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:07.800 
back in the northern hemisphere looks

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:09.609 
back in the northern hemisphere looks
quite<00:06:08.099> bright<00:06:08.339> so<00:06:08.610> that<00:06:08.759> might<00:06:08.909> be<00:06:08.939> promising

00:06:09.609 --> 00:06:09.619 
quite bright so that might be promising
