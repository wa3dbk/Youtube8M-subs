much muscle you can build burn here and

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:58.740 
much muscle you can build burn here and
then<00:01:56.440> add<00:01:56.680> that<00:01:56.710> to<00:01:57.240> what<00:01:58.240> your<00:01:58.390> weight<00:01:58.540> is

then add that to what your weight is

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:00.570 
then add that to what your weight is
your<00:01:59.230> body<00:01:59.410> weight<00:01:59.650> is<00:01:59.830> when<00:02:00.160> you're<00:02:00.280> in<00:02:00.370> a<00:02:00.430> low

competition day I weighed 150 pounds now

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.390 
competition day I weighed 150 pounds now
I<00:02:10.959> was<00:02:11.170> at<00:02:11.290> about<00:02:11.380> four<00:02:11.740> or<00:02:11.800> five<00:02:11.980> percent<00:02:12.100> body

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
I was at about four or five percent body

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.750 
I was at about four or five percent body
fat<00:02:12.520> that<00:02:12.670> day<00:02:13.920> and<00:02:14.920> so<00:02:15.100> to<00:02:15.160> accurately<00:02:15.670> gauge

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
fat that day and so to accurately gauge

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.710 
fat that day and so to accurately gauge
how<00:02:16.750> much<00:02:17.310> muscle<00:02:18.310> I've<00:02:18.580> gained<00:02:18.880> I<00:02:19.180> would<00:02:19.570> have

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
how much muscle I've gained I would have

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.620 
how much muscle I've gained I would have
to<00:02:20.130> get<00:02:21.130> back<00:02:21.310> to<00:02:21.340> that<00:02:21.580> body<00:02:21.730> fat<00:02:21.970> a<00:02:22.180> good<00:02:22.330> six

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
to get back to that body fat a good six

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:24.840 
to get back to that body fat a good six
months<00:02:22.720> or<00:02:23.200> year<00:02:23.410> later<00:02:23.680> and<00:02:23.950> see<00:02:24.490> what<00:02:24.820> I

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:24.850 
months or year later and see what I

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:27.180 
months or year later and see what I
would<00:02:24.970> win<00:02:25.209> so<00:02:25.870> if<00:02:26.200> I<00:02:26.320> was<00:02:26.470> at<00:02:26.590> a<00:02:26.650> five<00:02:26.830> percent

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
would win so if I was at a five percent

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:29.250 
would win so if I was at a five percent
at<00:02:27.370> one<00:02:27.550> hundred<00:02:27.610> and<00:02:27.820> fifty<00:02:28.060> pounds<00:02:28.090> a<00:02:28.630> year

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
at one hundred and fifty pounds a year

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:30.930 
at one hundred and fifty pounds a year
later<00:02:29.500> I<00:02:29.590> would<00:02:29.860> get<00:02:29.980> down<00:02:30.190> to<00:02:30.340> five<00:02:30.580> percent

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
later I would get down to five percent

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.270 
later I would get down to five percent
and<00:02:31.150> if<00:02:31.570> I<00:02:31.660> weighed<00:02:31.810> 160<00:02:32.560> pounds<00:02:32.890> that<00:02:33.100> I<00:02:33.160> would

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
and if I weighed 160 pounds that I would

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:34.440 
and if I weighed 160 pounds that I would
know<00:02:33.370> I've<00:02:33.490> put<00:02:33.580> on<00:02:33.670> about<00:02:33.730> ten<00:02:34.090> pounds<00:02:34.390> of

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
know I've put on about ten pounds of

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:37.410 
know I've put on about ten pounds of
muscle<00:02:34.810> now<00:02:35.650> seeing<00:02:36.610> that<00:02:36.790> I<00:02:36.850> can<00:02:37.060> put<00:02:37.180> 10

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
muscle now seeing that I can put 10

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.630 
muscle now seeing that I can put 10
pounds<00:02:37.450> of<00:02:37.780> muscle<00:02:37.900> on<00:02:38.200> in<00:02:38.530> one<00:02:38.680> year<00:02:38.950> it

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
pounds of muscle on in one year it

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.850 
pounds of muscle on in one year it
doesn't<00:02:39.940> matter<00:02:40.120> if<00:02:40.360> I've<00:02:40.510> gained<00:02:40.840> over<00:02:41.200> my

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 
doesn't matter if I've gained over my

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:44.340 
doesn't matter if I've gained over my
bowl<00:02:42.070> if<00:02:42.310> I've<00:02:42.430> gained<00:02:42.640> 15<00:02:43.090> pounds<00:02:43.260> 30<00:02:44.260> pounds

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:44.350 
bowl if I've gained 15 pounds 30 pounds

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:47.430 
bowl if I've gained 15 pounds 30 pounds
or<00:02:44.950> 50<00:02:45.459> pounds<00:02:45.610> so<00:02:46.360> I<00:02:46.390> could<00:02:46.750> I<00:02:47.019> could<00:02:47.170> get<00:02:47.320> up

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 
or 50 pounds so I could I could get up

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.860 
or 50 pounds so I could I could get up
to<00:02:47.560> 200<00:02:48.010> pounds<00:02:48.430> and<00:02:48.910> then<00:02:49.060> cut<00:02:49.300> all<00:02:49.450> that<00:02:49.630> fat

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
to 200 pounds and then cut all that fat

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:52.020 
to 200 pounds and then cut all that fat
off<00:02:50.050> and<00:02:50.380> so<00:02:50.560> weigh<00:02:50.739> 160<00:02:51.430> pounds<00:02:51.700> at<00:02:51.820> the<00:02:51.850> end

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
off and so weigh 160 pounds at the end

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:54.680 
off and so weigh 160 pounds at the end
of<00:02:52.120> the<00:02:52.180> year<00:02:52.360> or<00:02:52.810> I<00:02:52.989> can<00:02:53.410> weigh<00:02:53.739> 175<00:02:54.550> pounds

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
of the year or I can weigh 175 pounds

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:58.920 
of the year or I can weigh 175 pounds
cut<00:02:56.040> 15<00:02:57.040> pounds<00:02:57.370> off<00:02:57.489> and<00:02:57.790> so<00:02:58.000> the<00:02:58.630> hundred

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
cut 15 pounds off and so the hundred

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:01.080 
cut 15 pounds off and so the hundred
gained<00:02:59.230> 10<00:02:59.440> pounds<00:02:59.620> of<00:02:59.769> muscle<00:02:59.890> over<00:03:00.160> here<00:03:00.489> so

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.090 
gained 10 pounds of muscle over here so

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:04.289 
gained 10 pounds of muscle over here so
don't<00:03:01.750> gauge<00:03:02.080> what<00:03:02.739> your<00:03:02.890> goal<00:03:03.130> weight<00:03:03.310> is<00:03:03.610> by

how fat you want to get essentially you
