 futuristic environment black ops 2 us 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.830
 presents a new enemy

 military infrastructure of the usa 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:25.619
 using such technology to 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.840
 provoke an armed conflict between 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.670

 history 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.420

 protect the presidents of the us and 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.620
 France of a surprise ambush 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.690
 prepared by the menéndez agents 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.789
 on the other hand frank boots the best friend 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.620
 by Alex Mason and as the protagonist of 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.840
 first game is alive 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.879
 hiding in a distant place called 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.559
 the vault world had already predicted in the 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.360
 insurrection of menéndez reason why 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.399
 it could be the only hope for 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.170
 stop this terrorist this has 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.239
 forced his former partner to 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.309
 investigate his whereabouts and find the 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.470
 way to stop menéndez and avoid 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.480
 an even greater war 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.070
 delivery is far from the concept 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:10.050
 used in the previous games of 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.790
 useful colosio the main plot we 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:14.460
 places on the one hand in the middle of a 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.320
 new cold war in 2025 while 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.030
 that another part develops in the 80s 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.310
 within the same campaign there 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.020
 missions called strike force where 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.330
 presents us with a style of game never 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.370
 previously implemented in call of duty these 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.050
 levels can be explored with certain 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:30.180
 freedom such as a title of the genre 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:32.400
 sandbox our decisions in the field 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.170
 of battle directly affect the way 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.790
 in which the story concludes the game 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.380
 develops according to the actions that 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.720
 we are taking how to eliminate or not 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.130
 certain objectives take different routes 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.140
 and even protect characters 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.030
 important a great variety of 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.250
 missions make up the main campaign 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.410
 and we even dare to indicate that 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.600
 some are already the most memorable in 

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:53.610
 the whole saga all the conflict feels 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.770
 Real enough to keep them 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.170
 glued to the control until the final epic 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.570
 despite this we still have certain 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.729
 scenes that feel extremely 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:05.880
 which exaggerated flat reach 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:08.399
 fall back on old clichés does not surprise us 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.140
 that the campaign looks spectacular 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.619
 graphic engine that was integrated into the 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.420
 first 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.950
 part has been perfected for 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.230
 give us an incredible experience 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.000
 we noticed the improvement from the first 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.370
 moment when you look closely at the 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.590
 face of the characters or the detail of 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.480
 the explosions the voices in English that 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.400
 give life to the protagonists are like 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.620
 always first although we did not try 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.510
 said version we hope that the voices in 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:33.239
 Spanish for our region be the same 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.980
 of convincing each of the weapons and 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:37.230
 objects that we are able to use 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.659
 they have various functions some 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:42.900
 more useful than others without doubt the 

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:44.790
 droid m27 dragon fire is from our 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.620
 favorites because it allows us to explore the 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.760
 environment in addition to shooting the 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.470
 nearby enemies 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.540
 Another great addition is the spider 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:53.700
 robotics as it sneaks in places 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:56.220
 small with ease and transmits signal 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:58.440
 in video to your operator the inevitable 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:00.810
 multiplayer mode also presents 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:02.700
 substantial and impressive news 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:04.319
 futuristic armament we have the 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:06.540
 classic game modes like team 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:08.760
 deathmatch domination to fulfill and 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.890
 many more to this list is added the 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:12.359
 hard point mode in which we defend a 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:14.730
 point on the map that repeatedly 

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:15.710
 disappears and reappears in one place 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.990
 different 

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:19.790
 the best implementation that was added to 

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:21.860
 multiplayer is the new kind of 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:23.870
 customization that allows us to combine 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:26.480
 different per his armament to be 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:27.950
 prepared at all times as was 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:29.660
 wait for several of the weapons 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:31.640
 main and even those that 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:33.680
 strikes have been adapted to the concept 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:34.880
 futuristic thanks to this we have to 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:37.070
 our disposition 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:39.590
 robot drones and complete armors that 

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:41.270
 they make the battle easier even though 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:43.580
 progresses give balance to the game 

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:45.440
 excess of this advanced technology makes 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:46.190
 that the game is moments a little 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:48.170
 maddening 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:50.090
 such as in modern warfare the armament 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:52.130
 It is already so sophisticated that it allows you 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:54.380
 even see through the walls what 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:56.240
 that makes us think that once again this 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:58.070
 game does not really reward the 

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:59.570
 The players' skill is not 

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:01.760
 nothing but it seems that when trying 

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:04.010
 balance the competition simply the 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:06.230
 those famous ones returned unjust 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:08.330
 modalities where violent zombies 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:10.430
 they attacked us reappear in the delivery 

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:12.140
 now we will face more of the 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:14.240
 double undead of those who 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:15.980
 we were used to it for the first time 

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:17.690
 we can fight them in a new 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:20.180
 cooperative where up to 8 players 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:22.190
 can participate they will star 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:24.140
 a story through a huge map 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:26.150
 in which they must meet certain 

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:28.370
 objectives while being pursued by 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:30.980
 endless hordes of bloodthirsty 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:32.540
 undead three new characters are 

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:34.250
 integrate to the campaign of the zombies 

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:36.380
 besides that the history of 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:38.210
 munt the last map that was launched for 

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:40.010
 black ops at the end you will see that the story 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:41.690
 It takes a real meaning for those 

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:43.820
 players who got all the 

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:45.380
 previous game strikes we say 

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:47.180
 because the zombies are controlled in 

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:49.730
 this time by sanz instead of rick 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:51.710
 topher we have verified that it is no longer 

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:53.000
 enough to have many weapons and 

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:55.070
 stay in a fixed place to 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.230
 survive because the living dead do not 

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:59.150
 they just enter through the windows 

00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:00.980
 zombies look for the way to bite you 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:03.110
 as of place so do not be surprised 

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:05.210
 so out of nowhere it seems that they multiply 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:07.130
 instantaneously the good thing is that the 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:09.710
 classic projects like speed queue uy 

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:12.230
 jove curve and several others are of 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:14.600
 return in the same way return power 

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:16.340
 rocks at the most and urges that what 

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:19.010
 It usually helps a lot when most of 

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:21.260
 your classmates are not defeated 

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:23.630
 worry the classic four mode 

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:25.400
 players is also present in the 

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:27.110
 we must survive the attack of 

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:28.700
 endless waves of zombies 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:31.820
 while we advance little 

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:33.530
 in small and claustrophobic maps it fits 

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:35.120
 highlight that the true objective of 

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:36.830
 This game mode is not the one to watch 

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:38.240
 until what wave you can get but the 

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:40.820
 to complete the difficult 

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:42.620
 astérix call of duty black ops' os 

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:44.690
 arrival with an unpromising future 

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:46.940
 but loaded with an exciting 

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:49.160
 story that continues directly the 

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:50.870
 events of the first part this without 

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:52.640
 tell the gigantic modality 

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:55.010
 multiplayer the future content 

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:56.900
 downloadable that will surely be large and 

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:58.670
 an interesting proposal reflected in 

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:00.500
 the zombies option maybe many 

00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:02.420
 continue to have faith in the franchise but 

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:04.580
 this should not be an impediment to 

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:06.770
 that enjoy this shocking sequel 

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:08.720
 the battle that started in the 

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:12.550
 past and survive in the future to 

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:12.550
