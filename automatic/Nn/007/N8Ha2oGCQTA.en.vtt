Genet<00:02:28.810> shower<00:02:29.020> I<00:02:29.080> think<00:02:29.290> that<00:02:29.410> the<00:02:29.650> idea<00:02:29.770> is<00:02:30.010> to

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130 
Genet shower I think that the idea is to

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:32.520 
Genet shower I think that the idea is to
apply<00:02:30.430> it<00:02:30.550> daily<00:02:30.910> so<00:02:31.570> some<00:02:32.140> people<00:02:32.350> do<00:02:32.440> that

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
apply it daily so some people do that

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:33.690 
apply it daily so some people do that

Tyler actually have some ID right into
the<00:02:33.790> blog<00:02:33.910> saying<00:02:34.120> he's<00:02:34.300> been<00:02:34.330> using<00:02:34.570> it<00:02:34.750> for<00:02:34.780> a

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
the blog saying he's been using it for a

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:37.260 
the blog saying he's been using it for a
couple<00:02:35.410> of<00:02:35.560> years<00:02:35.620> use<00:02:35.950> it<00:02:36.100> every<00:02:36.400> day<00:02:36.430> and<00:02:36.550> has

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:37.270 
couple of years use it every day and has

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:39.240 
couple of years use it every day and has
never<00:02:37.420> been<00:02:37.600> called<00:02:37.810> out<00:02:37.959> how<00:02:38.620> expensive<00:02:38.950> is

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
never been called out how expensive is

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:41.280 
never been called out how expensive is
it<00:02:39.280> I<00:02:39.550> think<00:02:40.000> it's<00:02:40.090> 4995<00:02:40.900> that's<00:02:41.140> been<00:02:41.260> a

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
it I think it's 4995 that's been a

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:43.250 
it I think it's 4995 that's been a
month's<00:02:41.590> worth<00:02:41.830> of<00:02:42.070> a<00:02:42.130> month's<00:02:42.670> worth<00:02:42.820> of<00:02:42.910> here

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
month's worth of a month's worth of here

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.840 
month's worth of a month's worth of here
so<00:02:44.260> it'd<00:02:44.530> be<00:02:44.739> good<00:02:44.890> for<00:02:44.950> things<00:02:45.340> like<00:02:45.459> were<00:02:45.790> you

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:45.850 
so it'd be good for things like were you

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:48.090 
so it'd be good for things like were you
if<00:02:46.420> you<00:02:46.660> don't<00:02:46.989> want<00:02:47.260> the<00:02:47.380> world<00:02:47.560> to<00:02:47.770> know<00:02:47.800> that

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:48.100 
if you don't want the world to know that

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:50.220 
if you don't want the world to know that
