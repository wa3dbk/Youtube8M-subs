00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.119
 good afternoon another miracle another 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.210
 last week I was three 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:24.380
 workouts start passionately workouts on 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:28.410
 her palette prices different traction 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:31.250
 multiples of flies and turned out like 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:34.260
 red floor department on the principle of 2 + 1 2 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:37.550
 praying quickly and 11 pauses and climbed on 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:41.670
 maximum weight per creation by under 200 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:46.920
 good enough dynamics from the side 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:51.360
 i like that sickened too began to grow 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:55.290
 after that there were deadlifts and 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:58.380
 on a separation a pause of 5 seconds what not to do 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:01:00.090
 if you know the speed you can 

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:02.430
 subdivide at speed 3 is active 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.199
 I use the program reactive it then 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:08.340
 when to put the barbell on the chest and 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:11.610
 Click for example or when the feed is sharp 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:14.759
 fall dungeon and pop up start on 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:17.759
 speed is the speed at which you 

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:19.370
 start out as if uncomfortable 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:24.409
 position already in the stretched position 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:24.409
 is with the sacred as after all the thrusts 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:30.830
 because the camp is essentially 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:34.280
 manifestation of each speed then 2 each 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:36.590
 exercise is useful isolation and only 30 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:39.860
 years to sit did not take off 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:41.660
 the second day was the day of the bench 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:43.880
 be noted by the fact that on the eve of me 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:45.140
 to the cruelest and ears was respect 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:48.530
 so uncomfortable that left shoulder 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:51.730
 hurt a few days after i did 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:55.220
 six on 6 floor press 

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:57.700
 reading the back room and bench press which 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:00.440
 see further 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:05.270
 seen fat on the floor improvement is not the case 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:08.330
 I guess I 'll be at 10 4 I don't know why 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:09.800
 I'll go, why not 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:13.460
 Fairly honestly did not expect enough 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:14.930
 greater city ​​opportunity continuing 

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:16.790
 can be easy and comfortable grip 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:21.880
 I do not really see it right 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:24.740
 I do not put it turns out to catch this moment 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:26.330
 correct execution press on the floor only 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:26.980
 should touch the floor linger on 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:30.500
 some 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:36.080
 seconds then there is little space on the straight 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:39.080
 hands it is a bench press to reward in my opinion 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:41.750
 It was that in such 4 to 5 and accounting is very 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:44.180
 glad hard beat hard very much 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:47.870
 I prefer even large non-work 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:49.900
 work 32 and even the chest is mistaken 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:53.959
 work in full 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:58.080
 so here's a stomach handle 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:03:01.980
 but maybe those keeps turning 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:06.750
 1 and up to third of the maximum effort money 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:09.270
 thrust and bulk squat I did thrust 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:12.210
 brought tires try to go on 

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:13.140
 maximum 200 arena is the first approach and 

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:17.340
 Today 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:20.090
 of not mistaken not first he there 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:23.250
 just another one i shot the last three 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:24.870
 heavy this 300 is seen risen tight 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:27.080
 not very hard she exact tough in 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:30.210
 lower point 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:32.520
 where we hang too much but the top 

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:33.920
 tires practically not strung this me 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:37.020
 hold 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:41.160
 real look it on he grows enough 

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:42.930
 fast boiling of the rods i.e. without 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:44.060
 thanks which acts on a few me 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:45.930
 struggling 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:47.730
 here 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:54.989
 it grows very much this is the last 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:58.549
 approach to come quite slowly and 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:04:03.329
 but even here it turned out to cope 

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:05.280
 surprise dynamics in general is also not 

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:07.500
 like i started working synchronously and but 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:10.950
 and kicks they just starting kicks like 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:12.540
 used to dry before everybody learned 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:16.400
 I think this is the way a little 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:21.259
 right for example it's easier for me to get 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:21.259
 I finished with squats 4 to 8 

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:28.650
 I want to note on the frame of the cathedral that 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:31.770
 such surprise was harder than me 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:33.960
 I thought more than two hundred I did not climb myself though 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:36.330
 seems to be the top of the amplitude but I 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:39.900
 I think working back will work for 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:40.979
 you are seriously working fine legs see 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:44.060
 it is again weak. 

00:04:40.979 --> 00:04:44.060
 who will need to work 

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:53.280
 today he is all see you sochi 1
