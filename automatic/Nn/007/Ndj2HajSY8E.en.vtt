00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:50.710 
grabbed an old design a new design I
don't<00:02:48.530> think<00:02:48.680> it<00:02:48.740> really<00:02:48.770> matters<00:02:48.970> but<00:02:49.970> ok<00:02:50.210> so

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:53.800 
here are these two look at the thickness

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:56.350 
here are these two look at the thickness
difference<00:02:54.800> here's<00:02:55.130> the<00:02:55.640> barely-there<00:02:56.000> and

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:56.360 
difference here's the barely-there and

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:59.950 
difference here's the barely-there and
here's<00:02:56.780> the<00:02:56.930> curve<00:02:58.000> the<00:02:59.000> curve<00:02:59.210> is<00:02:59.450> pretty

00:02:59.950 --> 00:02:59.960 
here's the curve the curve is pretty

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:01.540 
here's the curve the curve is pretty
thick<00:03:00.200> compared<00:03:00.590> to<00:03:00.680> the<00:03:00.770> vert<00:03:00.920> barely<00:03:01.400> there

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:01.550 
thick compared to the vert barely there

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:04.420 
thick compared to the vert barely there
um<00:03:01.970> i<00:03:02.900> would<00:03:03.290> use<00:03:03.410> the<00:03:03.590> barely<00:03:03.830> there's<00:03:04.010> four

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.430 
um i would use the barely there's four

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:06.280 
um i would use the barely there's four
and<00:03:04.700> this<00:03:05.239> review<00:03:05.570> is<00:03:05.630> not<00:03:05.840> on<00:03:05.930> the<00:03:06.020> burly

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
and this review is not on the burly

and this review is not on the burly
there's<00:03:06.470> but<00:03:06.709> i'll<00:03:06.890> go<00:03:07.130> ahead<00:03:07.160> and<00:03:07.310> just<00:03:07.459> add

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:07.610 
there's but i'll go ahead and just add

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:09.780 
there's but i'll go ahead and just add
this<00:03:07.730> in<00:03:07.910> I<00:03:08.090> just<00:03:08.780> barely<00:03:09.020> there's<00:03:09.230> four<00:03:09.590> um

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790 
this in I just barely there's four um

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:12.520 
this in I just barely there's four um
daily<00:03:10.790> discharging<00:03:11.480> just<00:03:11.690> like<00:03:11.810> daily<00:03:12.320> and

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530 
daily discharging just like daily and

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:14.830 
daily discharging just like daily and
I'd<00:03:13.250> use<00:03:13.459> the<00:03:13.489> curves<00:03:13.880> for<00:03:14.150> maybe<00:03:14.360> tampon

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840 
I'd use the curves for maybe tampon

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.530 
I'd use the curves for maybe tampon
backup<00:03:15.230> or<00:03:15.470> like<00:03:16.070> before<00:03:16.670> and<00:03:16.880> after<00:03:17.420> your

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:17.540 
backup or like before and after your

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:22.350 
backup or like before and after your
period<00:03:17.709> that's<00:03:18.709> what<00:03:18.830> I'm<00:03:18.920> doing<00:03:19.190> kind<00:03:19.459> of<00:03:20.230> but

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:22.360

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:26.600 
um sorry I completely lost my train of

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:29.770

and you know the by kotex boxes are

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:54.430 
and you know the by kotex boxes are
pretty<00:03:48.890> small<00:03:49.900> most<00:03:50.900> of<00:03:51.110> them<00:03:51.230> and<00:03:53.260> it's<00:03:54.260> going

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:54.440 
pretty small most of them and it's going

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:56.259 
pretty small most of them and it's going
to<00:03:54.530> cute<00:03:54.769> design<00:03:55.070> and<00:03:55.340> isolate<00:03:55.790> guard<00:03:56.000> bright

00:03:56.259 --> 00:03:56.269 
to cute design and isolate guard bright

00:03:56.269 --> 00:03:57.490 
to cute design and isolate guard bright
in<00:03:56.390> the<00:03:56.480> middle<00:03:56.750> and<00:03:56.930> it's<00:03:57.080> even<00:03:57.380> got

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:57.500 
in the middle and it's even got

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:00.360 
in the middle and it's even got
perforated<00:03:58.160> lines<00:03:58.430> to<00:03:59.239> help<00:03:59.420> even<00:03:59.720> better

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:00.370 
perforated lines to help even better

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:04.930

here I'll open up a barely there so you
can<00:04:05.060> see<00:04:05.209> the<00:04:05.360> differences

00:04:07.369 --> 00:04:07.379 
can see the differences

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:09.300

sorry I'm trying to do this with one
hand<00:04:10.950> okay<00:04:11.950> so<00:04:12.370> here's<00:04:12.700> the<00:04:12.790> barely<00:04:13.180> there<00:04:13.209> and

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:14.760 
hand okay so here's the barely there and

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:19.680 
hand okay so here's the barely there and
it's<00:04:15.760> got<00:04:15.939> a<00:04:15.970> big<00:04:16.150> difference<00:04:18.209> there's<00:04:19.209> a<00:04:19.359> hair

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:19.690 
it's got a big difference there's a hair

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:21.420 
it's got a big difference there's a hair
right<00:04:20.109> there<00:04:20.139> it's<00:04:20.799> probably<00:04:21.070> one<00:04:21.220> of<00:04:21.250> mine

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:21.430 
right there it's probably one of mine

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:28.050 
right there it's probably one of mine
because<00:04:21.639> my<00:04:21.850> hair<00:04:22.060> is<00:04:22.090> down<00:04:22.389> okay<00:04:23.199> um<00:04:23.729> so<00:04:27.060> the

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:28.060 
because my hair is down okay um so the

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:30.990 
because my hair is down okay um so the
curve<00:04:28.300> is<00:04:28.570> I<00:04:28.750> thing<00:04:29.370> wait<00:04:30.370> no<00:04:30.520> I<00:04:30.550> think<00:04:30.910> though

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:31.000 
curve is I thing wait no I think though

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.600 
curve is I thing wait no I think though
the<00:04:31.120> same<00:04:31.330> size<00:04:31.800> I'm<00:04:32.800> pretty<00:04:32.979> sure<00:04:33.130> the<00:04:33.310> same

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:33.610 
the same size I'm pretty sure the same

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:34.710 
the same size I'm pretty sure the same
size<00:04:33.820> but<00:04:34.090> they<00:04:34.210> definitely<00:04:34.419> have<00:04:34.690> different

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:34.720 
size but they definitely have different

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:37.200 
size but they definitely have different
lead<00:04:35.110> guard<00:04:35.350> brights<00:04:35.620> um<00:04:36.009> one<00:04:36.850> thing<00:04:36.880> i<00:04:37.150> don't
