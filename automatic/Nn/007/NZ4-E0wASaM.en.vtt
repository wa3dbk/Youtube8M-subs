00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:05.440
 hello friends of the next sells cupcakes 

00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:08.080
 puntocom in this video we are going to do 

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:10.469
 this candy bitumen that is very easy 

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:14.639
 and very practical for any decoration 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.639
 let's see what it is you need 

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:32.710
 where candy will you need milk 

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:36.900
 here I have 6 tablespoons sugar glass that 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:39.580
 They are 3 cups of half a cup of butter 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:41.170
 1 cup of sugar 

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:43.630
 I am using mascabado sugar 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:46.360
 because it will give a special flavor to 

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:50.080
 this bitumen to intensify the flavor 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:53.500
 of the candy so is this and a 

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:55.780
 just a pinch of salt the first thing that 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:58.230
 we are going to do is to melt the 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:58.230
 Butter 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:05.700
 since we melted the butter now 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:07.890
 let's add the sugar 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.130
 we are going to add it little by little and we are going to 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.130
 go mixing 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:20.020
 since we add sugar now let's 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:20.020
 add a pinch of salt 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:28.320
 kita 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:31.590
 and we stop moving 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.900
 If you see I have a very short flame to 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.930
 that we do not get burned but our 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:39.690
 candy and let's leave it here without 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:42.020
 stop moving until it reaches the 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:42.020
 tree 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:47.770
 well it's already boiling now I'm going to 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:52.410
 remove from the fire a moment and I'll 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:52.410
 add the milk without stopping to move 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:00.770
 since we mix the milk we are going to 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:03.350
 return it to the fire and we will let 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:05.570
 boil again 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:09.110
 well it's already boiling now I'm going to 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:12.350
 remove it from the fire already turned it off here and 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:14.600
 I'm going to leave it here to cool down more or 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:17.120
 less about 20 minutes good since 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:20.300
 we have united our candy we are going to 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:23.550
 mix with the icing sugar and let's go 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:25.800
 mixing little by little with the icing sugar 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:29.300
 I'm going to mix it first with the spoon 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.300
 and then I'm going to start beating 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:35.889
 add a little more sugar mixed it 

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:35.889
 with the spoon 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:42.739
 another little bit and so two of finishing with the 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:45.200
 sugar and so with this consistency we 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:49.849
 has to be our bitumen is a 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:51.379
 so thick and somewhat creamy is 

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:54.920
 Tuna is very sweet so I recommend you 

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:57.530
 to use it with flavor cupcakes 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:00.140
 that are not so sweet for example one 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:02.000
 of vanilla because if you use it 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:04.849
 with some chocolate then you're going to 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.400
 to be very cloyingly good now I 'm going 

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:11.880
 to go to the sleeve so you can see the 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:14.460
 consistency in which it will stay 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:16.860
 and I'm going to use this round mouthpiece 

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:19.800
 only for you to see 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:24.750
 the consistent good the only thing I'm going to 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:29.510
 to do is go in circles on the outside I go to 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:29.510
 go up and I'll end up here 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:37.010
 one 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:57.370
 if you notice the creamy consistency that 

00:03:54.070 --> 00:04:00.430
 it's good because that's how we end up 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:03.460
 our caramel bitumen I hope that you 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:06.360
 like and you know let me your comments
