00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:17.880

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:21.300
 I bring them to minecraft or the 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:23.539

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:38.690
 how to install maps but well I know what 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:41.270
 they unloaded us they were as commonly not 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:44.680
 would install and you're 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:44.680
 here we are on the map now 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:50.280

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:52.210
 and there we are in europe as in is 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.450

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:58.059
 and on the other side we have 7 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:01:00.690
 how is this as well as university that does not 

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:00.690
 let's go walking 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:06.380
 and how do you see there says welcome diversity 

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:08.420
 first go to the information room and 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.740
 Well here comes room of achievements that 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.410
 would be where we have to 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:15.350
 put the desire as you see here are that 

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:19.750
 is the parkour free fall escape 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:22.870
 labyrinth adventure survival and everything 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:25.090
 and here we have to go through if not 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:26.530
 we understand this well, you can go 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.810
 to the information room and here it comes 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:30.830
 first of all by the creators the 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:35.560
 creator 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:35.560
 a magnet by diversity to stain 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:42.640
 then well I woke up and the magnet all 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:44.619
 they who are the creators of the 95 wills 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.810
 more than all of them are the creators 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:50.259
 of the map they collaborated to do the 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:52.509
 map and in minecraft pocket edition and 

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:54.490
 well the rules are pretty simple 

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:56.890
 will not change creative salt unless 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:58.479
 that I am going to you is and in these moment I am 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:01.509
 in which I say but well this is not the 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:03.460
 map and then for just to show it 

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:05.679
 leaving his team in a chest of 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:09.160
 objects that no longer serve you not to speak to 

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:12.220
 the animals I'm serious do not break 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:14.860
 no block unless you are told no 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:17.260
 use mods except for the ones below 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:19.599
 do not cheat do not stop having fun 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:21.100
 you can use the take items that stay 

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:23.260
 installed 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:27.280
 to do at night or to do day 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:29.320
 because the checkpoints that are the beds 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.460
 Well, if you arrive at a checkpoint and it's not 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:33.930
 at night you will not be able to sleep 

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:37.189
 then there will be severe problems 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.189
 put in a peaceful way 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:41.590
 and all the objectives are pretty 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:44.230
 simple is simply to go to a 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:46.990
 room and meet the objectives and the 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:49.090
 end of this room will give us a wool and 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:50.740
 it's nothing we have to put there and 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:53.260
 those are the objectives quite 

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:54.790
 simple and the truth is very very 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:58.090
 similar to minecraft 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:03:00.610
 minecraft diversity here are the 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:02.740
 different parkour rooms that has not 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:07.450
 past that you have free to call the 

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:08.920
 past escape labyrinth adventure of 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:12.310
 survival 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:15.040
 and only at the end this door is 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:17.050
 will open if you get the six keys of 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:20.050
 Six of the challenges at the end 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:22.209
 of them the keys the cubes of 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:24.690
 wool I found them only if you manage 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:28.320
 complete each soft challenge 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:30.510
 this is the reality when completing all 

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:32.250
 these are what guys then then yes 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:34.320
 they are interested the idea can leave 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:37.830
 download the map the truth is 

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:39.870
 quite pretty good the map and it 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:41.850
 I bring completely free so 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:45.140
 well do not forget that I have twitter that 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:47.760
 I have facebook and also to forgive the 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:50.790
 text that they saw is the puree space 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:52.790
 of kraft something like that is called it is that 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:56.400
 I put it to give it a touch more like 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:59.220
 original more so it looks like 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:01.020
 more because it's the one that uses diversity but 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:02.460
 it does not come though the boy if you 

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:06.830
 install the map will not come with the 

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:09.650
 pack even the textures pack this one 

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:12.920
 but in the comments to send them 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:15.140
 West 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:16.970
 I think he left it in the description not 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:17.660
 I know the truth if you leave it in the 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:20.239
 description 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:23.270
 I put it there on twitter or I give it in 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:24.080
 facebook the truth I do not know well but 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:26.000
 so they will have it 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:30.370
