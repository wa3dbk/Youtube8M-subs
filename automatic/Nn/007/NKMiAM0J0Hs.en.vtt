00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:02.466
- HAPPY TAX DAY.

00:00:02.466 --> 00:00:05.466
[cheers and applause]

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:08.500
HAPPY AND TAX
ARE NOT WORDS

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:10.866
THAT REALLY SHOULD BE
IN THE SAME SENTENCE, BUT...

00:00:10.866 --> 00:00:13.066
IT'S LIKE WISHING SOMEONE
"HAPPY ROOT CANAL,"

00:00:13.066 --> 00:00:15.133
YOU KNOW?

00:00:15.133 --> 00:00:16.666
EVERY YEAR,
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WAIT

00:00:16.666 --> 00:00:18.300
TILL THE LAST MINUTE
TO FILE THEIR TAXES.

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.666
IT SEEMS LIKE THERE ARE A LOT
OF PROCRASTINATORS OUT THERE

00:00:20.666 --> 00:00:24.466
AND A LOT
OF AMATEUR-CRASTINATORS,

00:00:24.466 --> 00:00:27.800
BUT FOR ALL OF YOU
PRO-CRASTINATORS OUT THERE,

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:28.800
I HAVE GOOD NEWS.

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:29.966
IT MAY NOT BE YOUR FAULT.

00:00:29.966 --> 00:00:33.866
A NEW STUDY CAME OUT
ABOUT PROCRASTINATION.

00:00:33.866 --> 00:00:36.400
IT SAID--IT ACTUALLY WOULD'VE
COME OUT A LOT SOONER,

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.366
BUT THE--BUT THEY KEPT
PUTTING IT OFF.

00:00:38.366 --> 00:00:41.666
[laughter]

00:00:41.666 --> 00:00:44.400
RESEARCHERS
AT THE UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.233
HAVE DISCOVERED
A PROCRASTINATION GENE.

00:00:47.233 --> 00:00:49.400
APPARENTLY IF YOU LOOK AT IT
UNDER THE MICROSCOPE,

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.633
IT'S THE ONLY GENE
THAT'S WATCHING CAT VIDEOS

00:00:51.633 --> 00:00:54.766
ON YOUTUBE,

00:00:54.766 --> 00:00:56.933
AND THE OTHER GENES ARE LIKE,
"COME ON, LET'S DO STUFF."

00:00:56.933 --> 00:00:58.700
AND THEY'RE LIKE, "WAIT."

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:00.933
IT SEEMS LIKE SCIENTISTS
ARE ALWAYS DISCOVERING GENES

00:01:00.933 --> 00:01:02.200
THAT EXPLAIN
OUR BAD HABITS.

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.400
THERE'S A GAMBLING GENE.
THERE'S A SMOKING GENE.

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:05.866
THERE'S A HOARDING GENE.

00:01:05.866 --> 00:01:07.633
BASICALLY IF IT'S A SHOW
ON TLC,

00:01:07.633 --> 00:01:11.000
THERE'S A GENE FOR IT.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.400
I ACTUALLY HAVE
REALLY GOOD JEANS.

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:15.300
I JUST GOT THESE.
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THESE?

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:18.300
[cheers and applause]

00:01:22.966 --> 00:01:25.833
OH, TWO IN A ROW.
THAT'S GREAT.

00:01:25.833 --> 00:01:27.133
CALL ME CRAZY,

00:01:27.133 --> 00:01:28.966
BUT I THINK MAYBE
THERE'S ANOTHER EXPLANATION

00:01:28.966 --> 00:01:30.166
FOR WHY PEOPLE PROCRASTINATE.

00:01:30.166 --> 00:01:33.066
WE LAZY.

00:01:33.066 --> 00:01:34.966
I WANT TO HELP Y'ALL
OVERCOME PROCRASTINATION,

00:01:34.966 --> 00:01:36.100
SO BEFORE THE SHOW,

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:37.866
I GOOGLED "HOW TO BEAT
PROCRASTINATION,"

00:01:37.866 --> 00:01:39.300
AND I FOUND IT
REALLY HELPFUL.

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:41.333
IT'S A LIST ON BUZZ FEED.

00:01:41.333 --> 00:01:43.566
BUT THEN I ENDED UP
TAKING THE BUZZ FEED QUIZ

00:01:43.566 --> 00:01:45.566
ABOUT WHICH GOLDEN GIRL I AM,

00:01:45.566 --> 00:01:48.500
AND I'M ROSE.

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.666
AND THEN I REMEMBERED

00:01:50.666 --> 00:01:53.866
THAT I FORGOT TO WATER
MY ROSE GARDEN, AND...

00:01:53.866 --> 00:01:56.400
OH, MAN,
WHAT WAS I TALKING ABOUT?

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.533
OH, FORGET IT.
LET'S JUST DANCE.
