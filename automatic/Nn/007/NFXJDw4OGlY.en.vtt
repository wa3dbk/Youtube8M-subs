00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
wire from your stereo receiver up to the

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:16.310 
wire from your stereo receiver up to the
point<00:00:15.330> where<00:00:15.630> the<00:00:15.780> speaker<00:00:16.139> will<00:00:16.289> be

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
point where the speaker will be

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.790 
point where the speaker will be
installed<00:00:17.779> as<00:00:18.779> you<00:00:18.900> can<00:00:19.080> see<00:00:19.199> we've<00:00:19.619> already

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
installed as you can see we've already

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.779 
installed as you can see we've already
done<00:00:20.070> that<00:00:20.189> here<00:00:20.250> behind<00:00:21.180> me<00:00:22.400> the<00:00:23.400> next<00:00:23.640> thing

done that here behind me the next thing

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.759 
done that here behind me the next thing
that<00:00:23.820> we're<00:00:24.119> going<00:00:24.269> to<00:00:24.420> do<00:00:24.600> is<00:00:24.810> we're<00:00:25.500> going<00:00:25.619> to

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
that we're going to do is we're going to

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.980 
that we're going to do is we're going to
take<00:00:26.039> the<00:00:26.250> ends<00:00:26.640> of<00:00:26.699> that<00:00:26.730> wire<00:00:27.029> and<00:00:27.300> prepare

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
take the ends of that wire and prepare

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.009 
take the ends of that wire and prepare
it<00:00:28.140> to<00:00:28.170> be<00:00:28.439> connected<00:00:28.949> to<00:00:29.099> the<00:00:29.189> speaker<00:00:29.750> so<00:00:30.750> I

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
it to be connected to the speaker so I

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:32.630 
it to be connected to the speaker so I
have<00:00:31.230> a<00:00:31.289> short<00:00:31.320> piece<00:00:31.710> of<00:00:31.740> wire<00:00:32.040> here<00:00:32.399> that<00:00:32.430> I'm

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
have a short piece of wire here that I'm

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.520 
have a short piece of wire here that I'm
going<00:00:32.759> to<00:00:32.820> use<00:00:32.880> for<00:00:33.090> demonstration<00:00:33.530> purposes

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
going to use for demonstration purposes

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.030 
going to use for demonstration purposes
and<00:00:35.210> we're<00:00:36.210> going<00:00:36.360> to<00:00:36.390> start<00:00:36.660> out<00:00:36.870> by<00:00:37.110> slitting

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
and we're going to start out by slitting

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.690 
and we're going to start out by slitting
the<00:00:38.969> two<00:00:39.360> pieces<00:00:39.989> or<00:00:40.260> two<00:00:40.620> conductors<00:00:41.430> of<00:00:41.610> the

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
the two pieces or two conductors of the

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.900 
the two pieces or two conductors of the
cable<00:00:42.510> part<00:00:42.989> and<00:00:43.890> the<00:00:44.010> easiest<00:00:44.340> way<00:00:44.610> to<00:00:44.640> do

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
cable part and the easiest way to do

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.990 
cable part and the easiest way to do
that<00:00:45.120> is<00:00:45.840> with<00:00:46.559> a<00:00:46.620> set<00:00:46.920> of<00:00:46.950> wire<00:00:47.219> Clippers<00:00:47.700> like

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
that is with a set of wire Clippers like

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.670 
that is with a set of wire Clippers like
this<00:00:49.789> so<00:00:50.789> we'll<00:00:51.239> put<00:00:51.449> these<00:00:51.570> Clippers<00:00:52.050> on<00:00:52.289> the

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
this so we'll put these Clippers on the

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.400 
this so we'll put these Clippers on the
end<00:00:52.829> of<00:00:52.949> the<00:00:53.039> cable<00:00:53.629> right<00:00:54.629> between<00:00:54.840> the<00:00:55.230> two

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
end of the cable right between the two

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.799 
end of the cable right between the two
pieces<00:00:55.680> and<00:00:56.399> it'll<00:00:57.030> just<00:00:57.180> make<00:00:57.300> one<00:00:57.510> small

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
pieces and it'll just make one small

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.569 
pieces and it'll just make one small
snip<00:00:58.199> and<00:01:00.350> pull<00:01:01.350> the<00:01:01.469> wire<00:01:01.649> apart<00:01:02.190> just<00:01:02.399> a

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
snip and pull the wire apart just a

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.440 
snip and pull the wire apart just a
little<00:01:02.820> bit<00:01:04.700> maybe<00:01:05.700> about<00:01:05.790> an<00:01:06.119> inch<00:01:06.270> and<00:01:06.420> a

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
little bit maybe about an inch and a

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.990 
little bit maybe about an inch and a
half<00:01:06.479> is<00:01:06.930> usually<00:01:07.439> sufficient<00:01:07.909> depending<00:01:08.909> on

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
half is usually sufficient depending on

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.539 
half is usually sufficient depending on
the<00:01:09.090> size<00:01:09.299> of<00:01:09.450> your<00:01:09.600> speakers<00:01:10.080> now<00:01:11.040> the<00:01:11.100> wires

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
the size of your speakers now the wires

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.969 
the size of your speakers now the wires
separated<00:01:12.270> we're<00:01:12.780> going<00:01:12.900> to<00:01:12.960> use<00:01:13.080> a<00:01:13.500> pair<00:01:13.950> of

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
separated we're going to use a pair of

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.580 
separated we're going to use a pair of
wire<00:01:14.220> strippers<00:01:14.610> to<00:01:15.390> remove<00:01:15.720> this<00:01:16.020> outside

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
wire strippers to remove this outside

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.620 
wire strippers to remove this outside
rubber<00:01:16.950> coating<00:01:17.460> and<00:01:17.610> expose<00:01:18.210> the<00:01:18.450> inner

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
rubber coating and expose the inner

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.249 
rubber coating and expose the inner
conductors<00:01:20.240> I'm<00:01:21.240> just<00:01:21.450> going<00:01:21.600> to<00:01:21.659> insert<00:01:21.930> the

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
conductors I'm just going to insert the

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.050 
conductors I'm just going to insert the
wire<00:01:22.560> into<00:01:22.830> the<00:01:23.070> strippers<00:01:23.490> here<00:01:23.790> and<00:01:24.350> squeeze

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:26.060 
wire into the strippers here and squeeze

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.690 
wire into the strippers here and squeeze
and<00:01:27.060> do<00:01:27.390> the<00:01:27.540> same<00:01:27.810> with<00:01:28.110> the<00:01:28.700> second

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
and do the same with the second

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.770 
and do the same with the second
conductor

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:32.780 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.700 

now<00:01:33.380> you<00:01:33.440> can<00:01:33.680> see<00:01:33.830> we<00:01:33.980> have<00:01:34.160> our<00:01:34.520> wire<00:01:35.300> exposed

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:35.710 
now you can see we have our wire exposed

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:38.140 
now you can see we have our wire exposed
prepared<00:01:36.710> and<00:01:36.980> ready<00:01:37.340> to<00:01:37.490> go<00:01:37.700> into<00:01:37.850> the<00:01:37.940> back

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:38.150 
prepared and ready to go into the back

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:42.250 
prepared and ready to go into the back
of<00:01:38.180> the<00:01:38.360> speakers<00:01:40.330> before<00:01:41.330> we<00:01:41.690> insert<00:01:42.080> it

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:42.260 
of the speakers before we insert it

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.070 
of the speakers before we insert it
we're<00:01:42.470> just<00:01:42.500> going<00:01:42.740> to<00:01:42.830> twist<00:01:43.190> it<00:01:43.660> two<00:01:44.660> three

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:45.080 
we're just going to twist it two three

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:47.440 
we're just going to twist it two three
times<00:01:45.260> just<00:01:45.710> to<00:01:45.890> make<00:01:45.979> it<00:01:46.220> nice<00:01:46.400> and<00:01:46.430> tight<00:01:46.670> to

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
times just to make it nice and tight to

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:50.170 
times just to make it nice and tight to
make<00:01:47.570> sure<00:01:47.870> that<00:01:48.080> it<00:01:48.229> doesn't<00:01:48.620> fray<00:01:49.430> as<00:01:49.760> we

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:50.180 
make sure that it doesn't fray as we

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.060 
make sure that it doesn't fray as we
start<00:01:50.479> to<00:01:50.600> insert<00:01:51.020> the<00:01:51.229> cable<00:01:51.410> into<00:01:51.710> the<00:01:51.890> back

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:52.070 
start to insert the cable into the back

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:59.350 
start to insert the cable into the back

00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.360 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.480 

most<00:02:00.020> speakers<00:02:00.320> are<00:02:00.800> going<00:02:00.950> to<00:02:01.010> have<00:02:01.190> some

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.490 
most speakers are going to have some

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:07.330 
most speakers are going to have some
type<00:02:01.760> of<00:02:03.040> pressure<00:02:05.200> release<00:02:06.200> that<00:02:06.950> will<00:02:07.100> hold

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 
type of pressure release that will hold

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:09.760 
type of pressure release that will hold
the<00:02:07.550> cable<00:02:08.000> in<00:02:08.119> place<00:02:08.479> as<00:02:08.780> you<00:02:09.140> can<00:02:09.470> see<00:02:09.650> on

make<00:02:32.300> our<00:02:32.450> electrical<00:02:32.990> connection<00:02:34.150> so<00:02:35.150> we'll

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
make our electrical connection so we'll

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:40.600 
make our electrical connection so we'll
just<00:02:35.600> come<00:02:35.780> over<00:02:36.020> here<00:02:36.290> to<00:02:36.770> the<00:02:36.890> wall<00:02:39.400> take<00:02:40.400> our

and<00:02:50.180> do<00:02:50.330> the<00:02:50.480> same<00:02:50.690> here<00:02:51.160> for<00:02:52.160> the<00:02:52.220> other

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
and do the same here for the other

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:57.790 
and do the same here for the other
conductor<00:02:54.640> and<00:02:55.870> then<00:02:56.870> with<00:02:57.080> our<00:02:57.110> electrical

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:57.800 
conductor and then with our electrical

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.850 
conductor and then with our electrical
connection<00:02:58.280> made<00:02:58.630> in<00:02:59.630> this<00:03:00.110> case<00:03:00.380> this<00:03:00.710> will

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:00.860 
connection made in this case this will

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:02.980 
connection made in this case this will
be<00:03:00.920> a<00:03:01.040> hanging<00:03:01.310> speaker<00:03:01.970> we<00:03:02.150> already<00:03:02.450> have<00:03:02.690> a
