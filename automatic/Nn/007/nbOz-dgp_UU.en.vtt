ends are a clean cut since they're not

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:26.359 
ends are a clean cut since they're not
they'll<00:00:25.289> have<00:00:25.439> trouble<00:00:25.590> getting<00:00:25.920> through<00:00:26.220> the

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.929 
they'll have trouble getting through the
crimps<00:00:27.230> so<00:00:28.230> I'm<00:00:28.320> cleaning<00:00:29.160> these<00:00:29.369> tag<00:00:29.670> ends

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
crimps so I'm cleaning these tag ends

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.020 
crimps so I'm cleaning these tag ends
make<00:00:30.449> sure<00:00:30.660> it's<00:00:30.840> nice<00:00:30.990> and<00:00:31.019> clean<00:00:31.199> cuts<00:00:32.030> take

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:40.160 
one of these crimps and run the line
through<00:00:36.149> it<00:00:38.570> probably<00:00:39.570> leave<00:00:39.750> out<00:00:39.899> about

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
through it probably leave out about

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.209 
through it probably leave out about
seven<00:00:40.500> or<00:00:40.559> eight<00:00:40.590> inches

seven or eight inches

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.779 
seven or eight inches
I'll<00:00:42.090> make<00:00:42.239> a<00:00:42.270> loop<00:00:42.570> in<00:00:42.809> the<00:00:42.840> line<00:00:43.789> probably

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
I'll make a loop in the line probably

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.610 
I'll make a loop in the line probably
about<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.210> size<00:00:45.390> of<00:00:45.750> a<00:00:45.780> half<00:00:45.899> dollar

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
about the size of a half dollar

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.400 
about the size of a half dollar
I've<00:00:47.280> got<00:00:47.460> about<00:00:47.579> five<00:00:48.030> inches<00:00:48.390> of<00:00:48.450> line<00:00:49.079> left

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
I've got about five inches of line left

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.380 
I've got about five inches of line left
over<00:00:49.739> I'm<00:00:50.370> gonna<00:00:50.520> run<00:00:50.700> it<00:00:50.820> through<00:00:50.969> that<00:00:51.210> loop

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
over I'm gonna run it through that loop

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:58.130

once<00:00:53.059> twice<00:00:54.770> three<00:00:55.770> times<00:00:56.329> take<00:00:57.329> that<00:00:57.539> tag<00:00:57.840> end

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
once twice three times take that tag end

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.760 
once twice three times take that tag end
run<00:00:58.800> it<00:00:58.890> back<00:00:59.190> through<00:00:59.600> your<00:01:00.600> crimp<00:01:00.989> it's<00:01:01.649> a

double<00:01:02.129> crimp<00:01:03.619> make<00:01:04.619> sure<00:01:04.799> you<00:01:04.860> cinch<00:01:05.189> it<00:01:05.309> up

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
double crimp make sure you cinch it up

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.180

end<00:01:35.590> run<00:01:36.590> it<00:01:36.710> through<00:01:36.890> the<00:01:37.070> hole<00:01:37.100> in<00:01:37.550> the<00:01:37.820> keel

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060 
end run it through the hole in the keel

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.110 
end run it through the hole in the keel
of<00:01:38.210> the<00:01:38.240> D<00:01:38.450> point<00:01:38.950> there's<00:01:39.950> no<00:01:40.100> hole<00:01:40.370> in<00:01:40.700> the

of the D point there's no hole in the
keel<00:01:41.360> you<00:01:41.390> can<00:01:41.660> use<00:01:41.840> a<00:01:42.050> quarter<00:01:42.650> inch<00:01:43.660> drill

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:44.660 
keel you can use a quarter inch drill

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:46.300 
keel you can use a quarter inch drill
bit<00:01:44.720> and<00:01:44.930> cut<00:01:45.230> a<00:01:45.260> hole<00:01:45.320> in<00:01:45.590> there<00:01:45.740> but<00:01:45.920> this<00:01:46.100> is

bit and cut a hole in there but this is

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:49.600 
bit and cut a hole in there but this is
probably<00:01:47.320> even<00:01:48.320> a<00:01:48.530> half<00:01:48.680> inch<00:01:48.950> hole<00:01:49.130> and<00:01:49.460> then

probably even a half inch hole and then

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.270 
probably even a half inch hole and then
