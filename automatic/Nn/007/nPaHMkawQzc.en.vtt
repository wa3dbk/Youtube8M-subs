00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.430

 I want to teach you little tricks 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:30.630
 they can help you realize these 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.610
 beautiful creations even if in the 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.439
 newspaper is very well explained 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.630
 forced steps with all the steps e 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:38.250
 especially with all the patterns 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:41.549
 where the problem may be the problem 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:44.850
 can not find the fantasies 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:47.640
 fantasies of these of this material 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:50.490
 so I don't know the musmi with the dots 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.729
 red the only moog the rules and so 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.619
 Street 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.720
 sometimes there are times not 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:57.329
 I find it definitely much easier 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.520
 find in many dedicated stores 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:03.179
 to creativity ea 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:05.009
 and no b these beautiful and tints of 

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:07.320
 grumble as you can see there are 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:10.110
 very many of yellow 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:12.780
 orange rose many shades and 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:15.120
 they are really very very beautiful 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.160
 this is the ideal format that i 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.500
 advice which is an a4 format 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:22.410
 in fact also all the patterns for 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:24.629
 all these characters are realized 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:27.870
 they all know inside a a4 sheet 

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:29.940
 a normal sheet we use without 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:32.819
 problems then what can we do 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:35.160
 if we don't find the fantasies we go 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:38.400
 paint them in what way then now 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:42.030
