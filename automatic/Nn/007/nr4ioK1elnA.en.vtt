00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.300 

hi<00:00:00.599> today<00:00:01.380> we're<00:00:01.560> going<00:00:01.650> to<00:00:01.740> show<00:00:01.949> you<00:00:02.010> how<00:00:02.280> to

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:02.310 
hi today we're going to show you how to

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.960 
hi today we're going to show you how to
clean<00:00:03.210> some<00:00:03.480> fresh<00:00:03.750> shrimp<00:00:03.929> and<00:00:04.319> I<00:00:05.100> say<00:00:05.640> fresh

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:05.970 
clean some fresh shrimp and I say fresh

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:08.330 
clean some fresh shrimp and I say fresh
only<00:00:06.270> because<00:00:06.600> previously<00:00:07.560> frozen<00:00:07.830> shrimp

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
only because previously frozen shrimp

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.780 
only because previously frozen shrimp
tends<00:00:09.030> to<00:00:09.150> be<00:00:09.300> a<00:00:09.330> little<00:00:09.889> fishy<00:00:10.889> if<00:00:11.340> you<00:00:11.400> will

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
tends to be a little fishy if you will

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.549 
tends to be a little fishy if you will
and<00:00:12.059> a<00:00:12.480> lot<00:00:12.509> of<00:00:12.690> times<00:00:12.990> when<00:00:13.139> people<00:00:13.170> have<00:00:13.530> had

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
and a lot of times when people have had

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:15.499 
and a lot of times when people have had
seafood<00:00:13.980> that<00:00:14.370> tends<00:00:14.639> to<00:00:14.790> be<00:00:14.910> very<00:00:15.089> strong

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
seafood that tends to be very strong

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:17.689 
seafood that tends to be very strong
it's<00:00:16.109> because<00:00:16.470> it's<00:00:16.680> been<00:00:16.800> previously<00:00:17.400> frozen

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
it's because it's been previously frozen

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:19.820 
it's because it's been previously frozen
before<00:00:18.270> and<00:00:18.539> it<00:00:18.630> was<00:00:18.750> stored<00:00:19.050> differently<00:00:19.619> and

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
before and it was stored differently and

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.130 
before and it was stored differently and
once<00:00:20.340> it<00:00:20.490> was<00:00:20.580> once<00:00:21.150> it<00:00:21.330> was<00:00:21.420> thawed<00:00:21.660> and<00:00:21.990> may

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
once it was once it was thawed and may

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.349 
once it was once it was thawed and may
have<00:00:22.430> sat<00:00:23.430> at<00:00:23.580> room<00:00:23.730> temperature<00:00:24.180> a<00:00:24.210> little

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
have sat at room temperature a little

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.210 
have sat at room temperature a little
too<00:00:24.570> long<00:00:24.750> and<00:00:25.019> things<00:00:25.199> of<00:00:25.320> that<00:00:25.439> nature<00:00:25.500> so

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
too long and things of that nature so

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.070 
too long and things of that nature so
I'm<00:00:26.490> using<00:00:26.670> some<00:00:26.939> fresh<00:00:27.090> shrimp<00:00:27.420> today<00:00:27.630> just

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
I'm using some fresh shrimp today just

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.599 
I'm using some fresh shrimp today just
because<00:00:28.410> if<00:00:28.710> you<00:00:28.830> can<00:00:28.980> get<00:00:29.099> a<00:00:29.130> hold<00:00:29.369> of<00:00:29.490> it

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
because if you can get a hold of it

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.490 
because if you can get a hold of it
during<00:00:30.240> the<00:00:30.390> summertime<00:00:30.869> it's<00:00:31.080> a<00:00:31.140> good<00:00:31.260> thing

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
during the summertime it's a good thing

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.020 
during the summertime it's a good thing
and<00:00:31.710> these<00:00:32.070> are<00:00:32.250> wild<00:00:32.579> shrimp<00:00:32.790> as<00:00:33.000> well

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
and these are wild shrimp as well

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.490 
and these are wild shrimp as well
they're<00:00:33.390> not<00:00:33.570> farm<00:00:33.930> raised

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
they're not farm raised

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.209 
they're not farm raised
so<00:00:35.460> this<00:00:36.210> size<00:00:36.480> here<00:00:36.840> is<00:00:36.930> about<00:00:37.170> a<00:00:37.200> 20<00:00:37.590> 125

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
so this size here is about a 20 125

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.520 
so this size here is about a 20 125
which<00:00:38.610> means<00:00:38.879> there's<00:00:39.149> about<00:00:39.329> 21<00:00:39.719> to<00:00:40.020> 25<00:00:40.469> of

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
which means there's about 21 to 25 of

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.979 
which means there's about 21 to 25 of
these<00:00:40.860> per<00:00:41.100> pound<00:00:41.370> as<00:00:42.030> far<00:00:42.270> as<00:00:42.390> that<00:00:42.540> goes<00:00:42.600> and

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
these per pound as far as that goes and

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.229 
these per pound as far as that goes and
these<00:00:43.410> are<00:00:43.559> some<00:00:43.739> Gulf<00:00:43.950> white<00:00:44.219> shrimp<00:00:44.579> so

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
these are some Gulf white shrimp so

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:46.940 
these are some Gulf white shrimp so
these<00:00:45.840> have<00:00:46.020> already<00:00:46.170> had<00:00:46.410> the<00:00:46.559> heads<00:00:46.770> removed

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
these have already had the heads removed

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.690 
these have already had the heads removed
so<00:00:47.940> we're<00:00:48.090> just<00:00:48.120> going<00:00:48.450> to<00:00:48.480> peel<00:00:48.870> the<00:00:49.829> rings<00:00:50.370> of

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
so we're just going to peel the rings of

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.200 
so we're just going to peel the rings of
shell<00:00:51.390> off<00:00:52.039> along<00:00:53.039> with<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.309> legs<00:00:53.699> and<00:00:54.030> I'm

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
shell off along with the legs and I'm

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.840 
shell off along with the legs and I'm
gonna<00:00:54.390> leave<00:00:54.570> the<00:00:54.719> tail<00:00:54.960> on<00:00:55.340> we've<00:00:56.340> got<00:00:56.550> some

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.080 
show you how to make these the shrimp
into<00:01:01.620> into<00:01:02.010> quite<00:01:02.370> a<00:01:02.430> few<00:01:02.640> different<00:01:02.940> things

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
into into quite a few different things

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.210 
into into quite a few different things
but<00:01:03.570> I<00:01:03.629> usually<00:01:04.019> just<00:01:04.199> leave<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:04.530> tail<00:01:04.739> on<00:01:04.920> for

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
but I usually just leave the tail on for

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.960 
but I usually just leave the tail on for
a<00:01:05.250> multitude<00:01:06.060> of<00:01:06.299> recipes<00:01:07.130> I've<00:01:08.130> got<00:01:08.430> here<00:01:08.760> at

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
a multitude of recipes I've got here at

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.880 
a multitude of recipes I've got here at
just<00:01:09.180> a<00:01:09.299> paring<00:01:09.630> knife<00:01:09.659> and<00:01:10.140> I'm<00:01:10.560> gonna<00:01:10.740> go

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
just a paring knife and I'm gonna go

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.060 
just a paring knife and I'm gonna go
along<00:01:11.040> the<00:01:11.340> back<00:01:11.869> of<00:01:12.869> the<00:01:13.260> shrimp<00:01:13.439> there<00:01:13.830> and

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
along the back of the shrimp there and

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.870 
along the back of the shrimp there and
we're<00:01:14.760> just<00:01:14.909> going<00:01:15.030> to<00:01:15.090> remove<00:01:15.390> this<00:01:15.630> vein

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:16.880 
we're just going to remove this vein

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.210 
we're just going to remove this vein
with<00:01:17.880> our<00:01:18.030> fingers<00:01:18.650> because<00:01:19.650> we<00:01:19.830> don't<00:01:20.009> want

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
with our fingers because we don't want

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.200 
with our fingers because we don't want
to<00:01:20.340> eat<00:01:20.400> that<00:01:20.820> and<00:01:21.740> in<00:01:22.740> a<00:01:22.830> sense<00:01:23.159> this<00:01:23.670> is<00:01:23.729> just

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
to eat that and in a sense this is just

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.660
