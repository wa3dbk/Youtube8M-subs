it's a beautiful building where they
hold<00:01:59.050> different<00:01:59.380> classes<00:01:59.890> so<00:02:00.430> that<00:02:00.640> you<00:02:00.820> can

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.000 
hold different classes so that you can

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.240 
hold different classes so that you can
go<00:02:01.180> there<00:02:01.420> and<00:02:01.450> be<00:02:02.290> with<00:02:02.320> people<00:02:02.620> that<00:02:03.040> are<00:02:03.190> in

go there and be with people that are in
similar<00:02:03.430> situation<00:02:04.560> we<00:02:05.560> have<00:02:05.590> a

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740 
similar situation we have a

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:08.580 
similar situation we have a
collaborative<00:02:06.280> effort<00:02:06.640> in<00:02:07.120> for<00:02:07.900> example<00:02:08.289> our

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590 
collaborative effort in for example our

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:10.980 
collaborative effort in for example our
multidisciplinary<00:02:09.310> tumor<00:02:10.300> board<00:02:10.539> which<00:02:10.810> we

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:10.990 
multidisciplinary tumor board which we

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:13.620 
multidisciplinary tumor board which we
have<00:02:11.110> every<00:02:11.350> Wednesday<00:02:11.800> where<00:02:12.550> every<00:02:13.209> breast

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
have every Wednesday where every breast

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:15.810 
have every Wednesday where every breast
cancer<00:02:13.870> case<00:02:14.260> gets<00:02:14.500> presented<00:02:14.860> because

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:15.820 
cancer case gets presented because

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:17.400 
cancer case gets presented because
there's<00:02:16.240> so<00:02:16.420> much<00:02:16.570> information<00:02:16.900> out<00:02:17.350> there

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 
there's so much information out there

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:19.530 
there's so much information out there
from<00:02:17.890> all<00:02:18.130> different<00:02:18.400> disciplines<00:02:19.209> it's

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
from all different disciplines it's

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.470 
from all different disciplines it's
impossible<00:02:20.350> for<00:02:20.410> one<00:02:21.040> doctor<00:02:21.790> to<00:02:21.820> stay<00:02:22.360> ahead
