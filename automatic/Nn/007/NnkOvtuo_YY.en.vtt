00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:01.890 
hey guys I want to make a video here

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:03.649 
hey guys I want to make a video here
comparing<00:00:02.399> the<00:00:02.520> Nexus<00:00:02.879> 5<00:00:03.060> with<00:00:03.389> them<00:00:03.510> without

00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:03.659 
comparing the Nexus 5 with them without

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:06.110 
comparing the Nexus 5 with them without
the<00:00:03.899> Moto<00:00:04.140> X<00:00:04.470> del<00:00:04.830> Vic<00:00:05.009> patch<00:00:05.250> now<00:00:05.580> this<00:00:05.879> came

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:06.120 
the Moto X del Vic patch now this came

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.360 
the Moto X del Vic patch now this came
from<00:00:06.240> the<00:00:06.390> Moto<00:00:06.569> X<00:00:06.779> is<00:00:06.960> 4.4<00:00:07.589> Android<00:00:08.069> release

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
from the Moto X is 4.4 Android release

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.339 
from the Moto X is 4.4 Android release
so<00:00:09.000> this<00:00:09.150> patch<00:00:09.360> includes<00:00:09.780> the<00:00:09.929> Qualcomm

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
so this patch includes the Qualcomm

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:12.140 
so this patch includes the Qualcomm
dalvik<00:00:10.769> optimized<00:00:11.280> libraries<00:00:11.820> and<00:00:12.030> this

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
dalvik optimized libraries and this

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:13.430 
dalvik optimized libraries and this
should<00:00:12.330> help<00:00:12.509> performance<00:00:13.080> but<00:00:13.200> we'll<00:00:13.349> have

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
should help performance but we'll have

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.230 
should help performance but we'll have
to<00:00:13.500> wait<00:00:13.620> and<00:00:13.740> see<00:00:13.920> now<00:00:14.639> it<00:00:14.849> is<00:00:14.880> going<00:00:15.179> to

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
to wait and see now it is going to

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:16.970 
to wait and see now it is going to
improve<00:00:15.509> the<00:00:15.780> benchmarks<00:00:16.410> by<00:00:16.560> quite<00:00:16.830> a<00:00:16.859> bit

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
improve the benchmarks by quite a bit

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.859 
improve the benchmarks by quite a bit
stuff<00:00:17.369> like<00:00:17.520> on<00:00:17.670> 22<00:00:17.970> and<00:00:18.000> quadrant<00:00:18.480> should<00:00:18.690> go

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
stuff like on 22 and quadrant should go

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:20.240 
stuff like on 22 and quadrant should go
up<00:00:19.020> but<00:00:19.260> whether<00:00:19.590> or<00:00:19.740> not<00:00:19.830> it's<00:00:20.010> any

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
up but whether or not it's any

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:21.710 
up but whether or not it's any
real-world<00:00:20.640> difference<00:00:21.270> that's<00:00:21.510> what<00:00:21.660> we

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
real-world difference that's what we

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.480 
real-world difference that's what we
want<00:00:21.869> to<00:00:21.960> find<00:00:22.140> out<00:00:22.289> here<00:00:22.529> it<00:00:22.680> is<00:00:23.189> stock

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
want to find out here it is stock

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.460 
want to find out here it is stock
grommet<00:00:23.880> is<00:00:24.000> stock<00:00:24.240> kernel<00:00:24.510> and<00:00:24.810> yeah<00:00:25.230> here<00:00:25.410> we

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
grommet is stock kernel and yeah here we

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.380 
grommet is stock kernel and yeah here we
go<00:00:25.619> so<00:00:26.519> we'll<00:00:26.670> start<00:00:26.849> off<00:00:26.910> with<00:00:27.090> some<00:00:27.240> up

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
go so we'll start off with some up

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:28.670 
go so we'll start off with some up
opening<00:00:27.779> speed<00:00:28.050> tests<00:00:28.349> and<00:00:28.439> if<00:00:28.529> you're

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
opening speed tests and if you're

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.769 
opening speed tests and if you're
wondering<00:00:28.710> no<00:00:29.400> I<00:00:29.429> don't<00:00:29.730> have<00:00:29.880> to<00:00:30.060> Nexus<00:00:30.420> 5's

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
wondering no I don't have to Nexus 5's

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.600 
wondering no I don't have to Nexus 5's
this<00:00:30.900> is<00:00:31.050> one<00:00:31.349> nexus<00:00:31.710> 5<00:00:31.920> I<00:00:31.949> had<00:00:32.160> to<00:00:32.309> run<00:00:32.489> the

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
this is one nexus 5 I had to run the

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.190 
this is one nexus 5 I had to run the
test<00:00:32.850> all<00:00:33.120> the<00:00:33.180> way<00:00:33.420> through<00:00:33.660> on<00:00:33.780> dell<00:00:34.020> vic

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
test all the way through on dell vic

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.810 
test all the way through on dell vic
first<00:00:34.500> and<00:00:34.770> then<00:00:34.860> i<00:00:34.950> had<00:00:35.100> to<00:00:35.130> flash<00:00:35.460> the<00:00:35.610> patch

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
first and then i had to flash the patch

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.940 
first and then i had to flash the patch
and<00:00:36.120> do<00:00:36.690> it<00:00:36.719> all<00:00:36.930> on<00:00:37.110> the<00:00:37.140> qualcomm<00:00:37.590> optimized

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
and do it all on the qualcomm optimized

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.530 
and do it all on the qualcomm optimized
dalvik<00:00:38.309> and<00:00:38.489> then<00:00:38.579> I<00:00:38.670> had<00:00:38.820> to<00:00:38.940> link<00:00:39.149> it<00:00:39.270> up<00:00:39.329> in

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
dalvik and then I had to link it up in

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.000 
dalvik and then I had to link it up in
the<00:00:39.750> Edit<00:00:39.899> when<00:00:40.200> i<00:00:40.230> was<00:00:40.410> actually<00:00:40.559> making<00:00:40.710> the

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
the Edit when i was actually making the

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.100 
the Edit when i was actually making the
video<00:00:41.309> so<00:00:41.610> be<00:00:42.030> aware<00:00:42.270> that<00:00:42.329> while<00:00:42.600> i<00:00:42.629> did<00:00:42.899> take

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
video so be aware that while i did take

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.840 
video so be aware that while i did take
a<00:00:43.140> lot<00:00:43.410> of<00:00:43.440> care<00:00:43.770> and<00:00:43.950> effort<00:00:44.100> in<00:00:44.399> the<00:00:44.489> Edit<00:00:44.760> to

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
a lot of care and effort in the Edit to

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.100 
a lot of care and effort in the Edit to
try<00:00:45.030> and<00:00:45.120> make<00:00:45.210> these<00:00:45.390> accurate<00:00:45.960> as<00:00:46.050> possible

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
try and make these accurate as possible

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.500 
try and make these accurate as possible
it's<00:00:46.829> not<00:00:47.010> exactly<00:00:47.160> scientific<00:00:47.640> and<00:00:48.180> it

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
it's not exactly scientific and it

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:49.610 
it's not exactly scientific and it
doesn't<00:00:48.899> really<00:00:49.050> prove<00:00:49.379> or<00:00:49.590> disprove

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
doesn't really prove or disprove

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.680 
doesn't really prove or disprove
anything<00:00:50.250> but<00:00:50.910> what<00:00:51.120> you<00:00:51.210> can<00:00:51.360> see<00:00:51.480> right<00:00:51.510> now

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
anything but what you can see right now

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.090 
anything but what you can see right now
is<00:00:51.870> they're<00:00:52.230> pretty<00:00:52.440> much<00:00:52.500> neck<00:00:52.829> and<00:00:53.010> neck

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
is they're pretty much neck and neck

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.590 
is they're pretty much neck and neck
sometimes<00:00:53.610> dalvik<00:00:54.000> is<00:00:54.090> getting<00:00:54.329> their<00:00:54.449> first

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
sometimes dalvik is getting their first

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.479 
sometimes dalvik is getting their first
sometimes<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:55.320> Qualcomm<00:00:55.770> optimized<00:00:56.129> dalvik

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
sometimes the Qualcomm optimized dalvik

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.099 
sometimes the Qualcomm optimized dalvik
is<00:00:56.610> getting<00:00:56.879> there<00:00:57.000> first<00:00:57.210> but<00:00:57.870> there<00:00:58.020> really

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
is getting there first but there really

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:59.869 
is getting there first but there really
isn't<00:00:58.469> a<00:00:58.559> major<00:00:58.859> difference<00:00:59.309> between<00:00:59.370> the<00:00:59.730> two

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
isn't a major difference between the two

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.459 
isn't a major difference between the two
you'll<00:01:00.059> see<00:01:00.210> youtube<00:01:00.600> here<00:01:00.840> loads<00:01:01.079> up<00:01:01.230> quite

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
you'll see youtube here loads up quite

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.380 
you'll see youtube here loads up quite
quickly<00:01:01.500> on<00:01:01.920> dalvik<00:01:02.280> optimized<00:01:02.730> but<00:01:03.270> that

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
quickly on dalvik optimized but that

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.200 
quickly on dalvik optimized but that
could<00:01:03.629> just<00:01:03.660> be<00:01:03.899> a<00:01:04.199> network<00:01:04.500> difference

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:05.210 
could just be a network difference

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:07.700 
could just be a network difference
opening<00:01:06.210> apps<00:01:06.360> seems<00:01:06.630> to<00:01:06.810> be<00:01:06.900> pretty<00:01:07.350> much<00:01:07.650> the

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
opening apps seems to be pretty much the

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.289 
opening apps seems to be pretty much the
same<00:01:08.100> on<00:01:08.159> both<00:01:08.340> from<00:01:08.790> being<00:01:09.000> completely

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
same on both from being completely

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:10.760 
same on both from being completely
honest<00:01:09.540> you<00:01:09.600> can<00:01:09.750> see<00:01:09.840> the<00:01:09.990> camera<00:01:10.229> test<00:01:10.560> here

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
honest you can see the camera test here

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.910 
honest you can see the camera test here
again<00:01:11.369> pretty<00:01:11.939> much<00:01:12.210> neck-and-neck<00:01:12.659> no<00:01:13.590> major

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
again pretty much neck-and-neck no major

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.039 
again pretty much neck-and-neck no major
differences<00:01:14.220> now<00:01:14.820> in<00:01:15.270> my<00:01:15.450> previous<00:01:15.840> video

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
differences now in my previous video

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.140 
differences now in my previous video
when<00:01:16.409> I<00:01:16.439> tested<00:01:16.740> out<00:01:16.979> Delva<00:01:17.430> curses<00:01:17.880> art

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
when I tested out Delva curses art

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.300 
when I tested out Delva curses art
runtime<00:01:18.630> art<00:01:19.020> definitely<00:01:19.650> took<00:01:19.799> a<00:01:19.860> lead<00:01:20.100> when

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
runtime art definitely took a lead when

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.130 
runtime art definitely took a lead when
loading<00:01:20.640> up<00:01:20.729> a<00:01:20.850> game<00:01:21.030> and<00:01:21.270> loading<00:01:21.659> up<00:01:21.780> a<00:01:21.900> level

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
loading up a game and loading up a level

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.170 
loading up a game and loading up a level
now<00:01:22.710> I'm<00:01:22.950> not<00:01:23.100> seeing<00:01:23.369> that<00:01:23.490> same<00:01:23.759> difference

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
now I'm not seeing that same difference

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.969 
now I'm not seeing that same difference
here<00:01:24.390> with<00:01:24.540> Qualcomm<00:01:24.960> optimized<00:01:25.380> elva<00:01:25.770> kit

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
here with Qualcomm optimized elva kit

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.350 
here with Qualcomm optimized elva kit
loaded<00:01:26.340> up<00:01:26.430> the<00:01:26.580> app<00:01:26.700> pretty<00:01:26.909> much<00:01:27.119> at<00:01:27.270> the

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
loaded up the app pretty much at the

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.450 
loaded up the app pretty much at the
same<00:01:27.540> time<00:01:27.750> and<00:01:28.049> we're<00:01:28.259> loading<00:01:28.590> up<00:01:28.680> the<00:01:28.979> level

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
same time and we're loading up the level

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.910 
same time and we're loading up the level
right<00:01:29.670> now<00:01:29.700> and<00:01:30.090> you<00:01:30.659> should<00:01:30.900> see<00:01:31.140> in<00:01:31.439> a<00:01:31.770> few

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
right now and you should see in a few

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.679 
right now and you should see in a few
seconds<00:01:32.340> or<00:01:32.430> so<00:01:32.610> that<00:01:32.909> it's<00:01:33.180> going<00:01:33.420> to<00:01:33.509> pretty

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
seconds or so that it's going to pretty

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.960 
seconds or so that it's going to pretty
much<00:01:33.869> load<00:01:34.170> again<00:01:34.560> at<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:34.829> same<00:01:35.040> time<00:01:35.310> so<00:01:35.670> not

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
much load again at the same time so not

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.640 
much load again at the same time so not
as<00:01:36.060> big<00:01:36.240> a<00:01:36.270> difference<00:01:36.479> here<00:01:36.840> as<00:01:36.990> we<00:01:37.350> saw<00:01:37.530> with

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
as big a difference here as we saw with

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.140 
as big a difference here as we saw with
art<00:01:37.890> and<00:01:38.040> really<00:01:38.490> there's<00:01:38.700> not<00:01:38.820> a<00:01:38.880> major

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
art and really there's not a major

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.030 
art and really there's not a major
difference<00:01:39.420> so<00:01:39.720> far<00:01:39.990> with<00:01:40.200> Dell<00:01:40.409> Vic<00:01:40.590> versus

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
difference so far with Dell Vic versus

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.679 
difference so far with Dell Vic versus
Qualcomm<00:01:41.430> optimized<00:01:41.790> dalvik<00:01:42.180> at<00:01:42.329> least<00:01:42.509> not

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
Qualcomm optimized dalvik at least not

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.660 
Qualcomm optimized dalvik at least not
the<00:01:42.840> eye<00:01:42.869> can<00:01:43.140> see<00:01:43.170> so<00:01:43.770> we're<00:01:43.920> loading<00:01:44.159> up<00:01:44.250> nova

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
the eye can see so we're loading up nova

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.399 
the eye can see so we're loading up nova
3<00:01:44.820> right<00:01:45.090> now<00:01:45.240> and<00:01:45.479> it<00:01:45.630> looks<00:01:45.750> like<00:01:45.899> Qualcomm

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
3 right now and it looks like Qualcomm

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.920 
3 right now and it looks like Qualcomm
optimized<00:01:46.740> dalvik<00:01:47.070> is<00:01:47.220> ever<00:01:47.460> so<00:01:48.149> slightly<00:01:48.570> in

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
optimized dalvik is ever so slightly in

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.929 
optimized dalvik is ever so slightly in
front<00:01:49.200> but<00:01:49.470> again<00:01:49.770> that<00:01:49.950> could<00:01:50.130> be<00:01:50.340> pretty

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
front but again that could be pretty

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.819 
front but again that could be pretty
much<00:01:51.210> anything<00:01:51.570> right<00:01:51.899> now<00:01:51.930> it<00:01:52.409> could<00:01:52.590> just<00:01:52.740> be

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
much anything right now it could just be

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.460 
much anything right now it could just be
slightly<00:01:53.220> down<00:01:53.909> to<00:01:54.149> me<00:01:54.299> with<00:01:54.630> pressing<00:01:55.170> one

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
slightly down to me with pressing one

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.230 
slightly down to me with pressing one
slightly<00:01:55.920> before<00:01:56.189> the<00:01:56.430> other<00:01:56.549> one<00:01:56.729> will<00:01:57.060> load

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
slightly before the other one will load

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.969 
slightly before the other one will load
up<00:01:57.270> a<00:01:57.450> level<00:01:57.659> here<00:01:57.960> and<00:01:57.990> nova<00:01:58.469> 3<00:01:58.619> is<00:01:58.740> a<00:01:58.770> little

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
up a level here and nova 3 is a little

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.499 
up a level here and nova 3 is a little
bit<00:01:59.070> difficult<00:01:59.250> it<00:01:59.549> doesn't<00:01:59.820> kind<00:02:00.000> of<00:02:00.090> load<00:02:00.270> to

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
bit difficult it doesn't kind of load to

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.060 
bit difficult it doesn't kind of load to
an<00:02:00.659> actual<00:02:00.780> point<00:02:01.110> where<00:02:01.350> you<00:02:01.409> can<00:02:01.560> easily<00:02:01.890> see

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
an actual point where you can easily see

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.649 
an actual point where you can easily see
that<00:02:02.100> it's<00:02:02.340> done<00:02:02.520> so<00:02:03.060> what<00:02:03.210> we're<00:02:03.360> looking<00:02:03.630> for

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
that it's done so what we're looking for

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.569 
that it's done so what we're looking for
is<00:02:03.990> the<00:02:04.110> continue<00:02:04.619> button<00:02:04.649> underneath<00:02:05.280> the

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
is the continue button underneath the

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:10.120 
is the continue button underneath the
text<00:02:05.939> so<00:02:06.060> let's<00:02:06.270> see<00:02:06.509> when<00:02:06.780> it<00:02:06.899> appears

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:13.270 

and<00:02:11.410> there<00:02:12.410> it<00:02:12.530> is<00:02:12.560> and<00:02:12.770> that<00:02:12.890> was<00:02:12.980> pretty<00:02:13.160> much

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
and there it is and that was pretty much

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.550 
and there it is and that was pretty much
exactly<00:02:13.700> the<00:02:13.910> same<00:02:14.180> time<00:02:14.420> so<00:02:15.020> in<00:02:15.140> terms<00:02:15.350> of<00:02:15.470> the

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
exactly the same time so in terms of the

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:16.810 
exactly the same time so in terms of the
real<00:02:15.740> world<00:02:15.950> tests<00:02:16.220> there<00:02:16.400> really<00:02:16.640> wasn't

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:16.820 
real world tests there really wasn't

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:18.520 
real world tests there really wasn't
that<00:02:17.060> much<00:02:17.120> difference<00:02:17.660> between<00:02:17.960> delva<00:02:18.320> and

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
that much difference between delva and

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:20.020 
that much difference between delva and
Qualcomm<00:02:18.950> optimized<00:02:19.340> dalvik<00:02:19.700> we're<00:02:19.850> going<00:02:19.970> to

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
Qualcomm optimized dalvik we're going to

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:21.250 
Qualcomm optimized dalvik we're going to
run<00:02:20.120> a<00:02:20.180> few<00:02:20.330> benchmarks<00:02:20.660> here<00:02:20.990> and<00:02:21.110> see<00:02:21.230> if

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
run a few benchmarks here and see if

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.080 
run a few benchmarks here and see if
there's<00:02:21.470> any<00:02:21.590> difference<00:02:21.770> but<00:02:22.550> real<00:02:22.880> world

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
there's any difference but real world

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:24.580 
there's any difference but real world
performance<00:02:23.270> tests<00:02:23.810> at<00:02:23.900> least<00:02:24.080> the<00:02:24.170> ones<00:02:24.350> I

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
performance tests at least the ones I

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:26.290 
performance tests at least the ones I
did<00:02:24.650> I<00:02:25.040> really<00:02:25.310> didn't<00:02:25.640> see<00:02:25.760> any<00:02:26.000> major

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:26.300 
did I really didn't see any major

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:28.360 
did I really didn't see any major
differences<00:02:26.900> between<00:02:26.960> the<00:02:27.380> two<00:02:27.560> now<00:02:28.190> we're

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
differences between the two now we're

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:29.710 
differences between the two now we're
running<00:02:28.490> quadrant<00:02:29.060> right<00:02:29.090> here<00:02:29.450> and<00:02:29.540> you<00:02:29.600> can

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
running quadrant right here and you can

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.240 
running quadrant right here and you can
definitely<00:02:29.900> see<00:02:30.290> that<00:02:30.320> Qualcomm<00:02:30.860> optimized

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250 
definitely see that Qualcomm optimized

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.430 
definitely see that Qualcomm optimized

a<00:03:02.590> difference<00:03:02.799> between<00:03:03.129> the<00:03:03.459> two<00:03:03.640> in<00:03:03.819> terms<00:03:04.030> of

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180 
a difference between the two in terms of

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.509 
a difference between the two in terms of
real-world<00:03:04.420> performance<00:03:05.099> next<00:03:06.099> up<00:03:06.190> we<00:03:06.280> got<00:03:06.310> on

00:03:06.509 --> 00:03:06.519 
real-world performance next up we got on

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:08.009 
real-world performance next up we got on
22<00:03:06.879> and<00:03:07.090> the<00:03:07.120> way<00:03:07.330> I<00:03:07.360> actually<00:03:07.540> did<00:03:07.870> these

00:03:08.009 --> 00:03:08.019 
22 and the way I actually did these

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:09.809 
22 and the way I actually did these
tests<00:03:08.379> as<00:03:08.470> I<00:03:08.560> gave<00:03:08.769> them<00:03:08.950> five<00:03:09.220> minutes<00:03:09.670> to

00:03:09.809 --> 00:03:09.819 
tests as I gave them five minutes to

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:11.520 
tests as I gave them five minutes to
cool<00:03:10.000> down<00:03:10.060> between<00:03:10.480> each<00:03:10.810> benchmark<00:03:11.379> so

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530 
cool down between each benchmark so

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:12.539 
cool down between each benchmark so
there<00:03:11.680> shouldn't<00:03:11.860> be<00:03:11.950> any<00:03:12.129> thermal

00:03:12.539 --> 00:03:12.549 
there shouldn't be any thermal

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:14.369 
there shouldn't be any thermal
throttling<00:03:12.700> will<00:03:13.360> speed<00:03:13.629> through<00:03:13.870> this<00:03:14.019> as<00:03:14.230> an

00:03:14.369 --> 00:03:14.379 
throttling will speed through this as an

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:15.960 
throttling will speed through this as an
22<00:03:14.709> is<00:03:14.860> quite<00:03:15.129> a<00:03:15.159> long<00:03:15.400> test<00:03:15.610> but<00:03:15.790> you<00:03:15.849> could

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970 
22 is quite a long test but you could

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:17.789 
22 is quite a long test but you could
already<00:03:16.090> see<00:03:16.209> Qualcomm<00:03:16.840> optimized<00:03:17.230> dalvik<00:03:17.650> is

00:03:17.789 --> 00:03:17.799 
already see Qualcomm optimized dalvik is

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:29.340 
already see Qualcomm optimized dalvik is
in<00:03:18.099> front<00:03:18.430> of<00:03:18.640> the<00:03:18.910> normal<00:03:19.360> dell<00:03:19.569> vixodi<00:03:19.959> r

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:29.350 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:56.900 

you

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:59.340 

Qualcomm<00:03:57.910> optimized<00:03:58.270> dalvik<00:03:58.660> finishes<00:03:59.110> first

00:03:59.340 --> 00:03:59.350 
Qualcomm optimized dalvik finishes first

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:03.480 
Qualcomm optimized dalvik finishes first
and<00:03:59.680> scores<00:03:59.950> around<00:04:00.540> 34,500<00:04:02.100> just<00:04:03.100> under<00:04:03.400> the

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:03.490 
and scores around 34,500 just under the

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:05.280 
and scores around 34,500 just under the

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:05.290 
galaxy note 3 dalvik finishes up and

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:07.560 
galaxy note 3 dalvik finishes up and
scores<00:04:05.530> 20<00:04:05.970> 8900<00:04:06.970> so<00:04:07.120> a<00:04:07.150> pretty<00:04:07.390> big

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:07.570 
scores 20 8900 so a pretty big

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:08.700 
scores 20 8900 so a pretty big
difference<00:04:07.690> there<00:04:08.050> you<00:04:08.140> can<00:04:08.290> see<00:04:08.320> the

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:08.710 
difference there you can see the

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:10.800 
difference there you can see the
individual<00:04:09.430> scores<00:04:09.730> right<00:04:09.970> here<00:04:10.240> so<00:04:10.690> you'll

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:10.810 
individual scores right here so you'll

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:12.540 
individual scores right here so you'll
notice<00:04:10.990> the<00:04:11.200> increased<00:04:11.590> scores<00:04:11.830> in<00:04:12.010> multitask

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:12.550 
notice the increased scores in multitask

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:14.460 
notice the increased scores in multitask

dalvik and cpu float point which is

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:15.930 
dalvik and cpu float point which is
actually<00:04:14.710> kind<00:04:15.010> of<00:04:15.100> interesting<00:04:15.250> it's<00:04:15.760> not

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:15.940 
actually kind of interesting it's not

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:17.490 
actually kind of interesting it's not
like<00:04:16.120> I<00:04:16.299> owe<00:04:16.329> scores<00:04:16.810> which<00:04:16.989> can<00:04:17.200> be<00:04:17.290> easily

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:17.500 
like I owe scores which can be easily

the Qualcomm optimized of it but this

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:25.050 
the Qualcomm optimized of it but this
could<00:04:23.380> just<00:04:23.560> be<00:04:23.680> a<00:04:23.980> normal<00:04:24.190> variation<00:04:24.940> in

22 benchmarks other than that they're

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:14.100 
22 benchmarks other than that they're
actually<00:05:12.610> very<00:05:12.640> similar<00:05:13.240> I<00:05:13.450> haven't<00:05:13.780> seen<00:05:13.900> any

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:14.110 
actually very similar I haven't seen any

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:15.270 
actually very similar I haven't seen any
differences<00:05:14.590> in<00:05:14.770> the<00:05:14.890> real<00:05:15.070> world

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:15.280 
differences in the real world

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:17.010 
differences in the real world
performance<00:05:15.490> if<00:05:15.940> you're<00:05:16.419> someone<00:05:16.690> that<00:05:16.750> loves

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:17.020 
performance if you're someone that loves

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:18.420 
performance if you're someone that loves
to<00:05:17.110> benchmark<00:05:17.650> and<00:05:17.860> wants<00:05:18.070> to<00:05:18.130> get<00:05:18.310> the

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:18.430 
to benchmark and wants to get the

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:20.070 
to benchmark and wants to get the
highest<00:05:18.640> scores<00:05:19.090> and<00:05:19.300> show<00:05:19.479> that<00:05:19.630> off<00:05:19.750> then

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:20.080 
highest scores and show that off then

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:21.420 
highest scores and show that off then
yeah<00:05:20.350> this<00:05:20.530> is<00:05:20.620> going<00:05:20.740> to<00:05:20.830> be<00:05:20.890> a<00:05:20.919> great<00:05:21.100> patch

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:21.430 
yeah this is going to be a great patch

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:23.159 
yeah this is going to be a great patch
for<00:05:21.640> you<00:05:21.729> if<00:05:21.910> you're<00:05:22.300> looking<00:05:22.660> to<00:05:22.780> flash<00:05:23.020> this

00:05:23.159 --> 00:05:23.169 
for you if you're looking to flash this

00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:25.020 
for you if you're looking to flash this
patch<00:05:23.410> and<00:05:23.650> see<00:05:23.770> a<00:05:23.800> major<00:05:24.160> difference<00:05:24.370> in<00:05:24.910> the

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:25.030 
patch and see a major difference in the

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:26.730 
patch and see a major difference in the
performance<00:05:25.180> I<00:05:25.780> don't<00:05:26.290> think<00:05:26.440> that's<00:05:26.530> going

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:26.740 
performance I don't think that's going

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:28.409 
performance I don't think that's going
to<00:05:26.830> happen<00:05:26.950> but<00:05:27.310> by<00:05:27.520> no<00:05:27.580> means<00:05:27.700> is<00:05:28.000> this<00:05:28.030> video

00:05:28.409 --> 00:05:28.419 
to happen but by no means is this video

00:05:28.419 --> 00:05:30.480 
to happen but by no means is this video
scientific<00:05:29.110> maybe<00:05:29.380> you<00:05:29.590> guys<00:05:29.740> are<00:05:29.800> feeling<00:05:30.250> a

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:30.490 
scientific maybe you guys are feeling a

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:32.219 
scientific maybe you guys are feeling a
difference<00:05:30.790> that<00:05:30.940> I'm<00:05:31.060> not<00:05:31.240> feeling<00:05:31.630> I<00:05:31.780> have

00:05:32.219 --> 00:05:32.229 
difference that I'm not feeling I have

00:05:32.229 --> 00:05:33.960 
difference that I'm not feeling I have
used<00:05:32.500> the<00:05:32.650> patch<00:05:32.860> i<00:05:33.130> have<00:05:33.280> used<00:05:33.490> without<00:05:33.700> the

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:33.970 
used the patch i have used without the

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:35.670 
used the patch i have used without the
patch<00:05:34.150> and<00:05:34.419> honestly<00:05:34.750> i<00:05:34.870> can't<00:05:35.080> tell<00:05:35.650> a

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:35.680 
patch and honestly i can't tell a

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:37.170 
patch and honestly i can't tell a
difference<00:05:36.100> if<00:05:36.220> you<00:05:36.310> put<00:05:36.460> them<00:05:36.610> both<00:05:36.729> in<00:05:36.940> front

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:37.180 
difference if you put them both in front

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:38.790 
difference if you put them both in front
of<00:05:37.240> me<00:05:37.330> without<00:05:37.479> running<00:05:37.840> any<00:05:38.020> benchmarks<00:05:38.380> i

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:38.800 
of me without running any benchmarks i

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:41.159 
of me without running any benchmarks i
don't<00:05:39.250> think<00:05:39.340> i'd<00:05:39.580> be<00:05:39.729> able<00:05:39.760> to<00:05:39.940> tell<00:05:40.180> so<00:05:40.540> yeah

00:05:41.159 --> 00:05:41.169 
don't think i'd be able to tell so yeah

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:44.220 
don't think i'd be able to tell so yeah
peace<00:05:42.040> out
