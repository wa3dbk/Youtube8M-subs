00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:09.200
 already approaching is to the man and to teach a 

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:11.800
 recipe that is spoken is the recipe 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:14.240
 perfect for halloween witch fingers 

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:16.430
 is that I really loved the 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:18.560
 result and they are super easy to make 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:20.960
 everything you need for this recipe 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:22.849
 you get it in the super except for the 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:25.950
 waxed paper is they got it 

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:28.710
 in stores where they sell raw materials 

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:30.780
 for this scary recipe you need 100 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:34.290
 grams of butter 

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:38.100
 half a cup of sugar 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:41.789
 one and a half cup of flour 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:44.600
 50 grams or less of almonds 15 

00:00:41.789 --> 00:00:46.489
 milliliters of vanilla essence 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.640
 if you want you can use dyes 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:48.640
 artificial 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.720
 two eggs 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.420
 and a pinch of salt 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.780
 and waxed paper 

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:08.230
 cream all the ingredients but reserve 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:10.240
 some flour 

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:12.520
 I wanted the fingers to be green 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.970
 so add 7 drops of coloring 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:14.970
 green 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:21.950
 since the color is mixed, cover your dough 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:24.620
 with self-adhesive plastic or what 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:26.890
 have on hand and take it for 30 

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:29.650
 minutes to the refrigerator 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:33.930
 when the serves add flour 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:33.930
 remaining and begins to knead 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:42.640
 while the masses preheat your oven to 

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:43.450
 180 degrees to know if the mass is already 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.130
 list 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:47.430
 You should note that you can not glue the 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:47.430
 hands 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.380
 take a little and start forming the 

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:56.720
 fingers the size and shape that you 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.790
 you want to take into account that one extreme 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:01.180
 it must be round and the other must be 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:01.180
 flat 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:15.200
 open your fingers in this way to 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.200
 make them more realistic 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:25.290
 take an almond and put in the part that 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:27.240
 to simulate a round did not nail 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.610
 the pressures so much just to mark 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:32.069
 where will the UDI I used a 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:34.110
 fork but with anything brand 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:36.470
 a few lines on the finger to simulate the 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.470
 knuckles 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:46.099
 mold your finger well and do not forget that the 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.099
 bottom part should be flat 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:08.700
 Put your fingers in a mold that you can 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.700
 put in the oven 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:28.550
 and you should bake the 15 to 20 minutes to 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:30.800
 180 degrees or until they look golden 

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:33.950
 for blood you can use jam from 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:35.970
 strawberry or blackberry remove the nails to 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:38.400
 the fingers 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:43.310
 in the little hole left by the nails 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:43.310
 jam and replace the honey 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:16.239
 on the bottom of the finger 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:16.239
 with lots of jam 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:23.530
 to make it look like this witch 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:23.530
 They cut their fingers 

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:29.630
 if some stayed like this there are also 

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:29.630
 marmalade cabbages 

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:39.400
 the more jam you put on the 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:39.400
 fingers will look much better 

00:05:01.009 --> 00:05:07.569
 they craved 

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:07.569
 Hahaha
