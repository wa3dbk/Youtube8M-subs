 Hi, I'm Lee Labrada from Labrada Nutrition. 

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:28.161
 I'm here to give you some tips on vascularization. 

00:00:28.228 --> 00:00:30.831
 What it is, and how you get it. 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.069
 All of our tips are for different physiques, the tip today is for advanced bodybuilders. 

00:00:37.204 --> 00:00:41.208
 look for other tips for beginners or fond of fitness on our website. 

00:00:41.208 --> 00:00:42.876
 So let's start talking about vascularization. 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:52.519
 What is vascularization? Vascularization is a term where the condition where a bodybuilder 

00:00:52.452 --> 00:00:59.927
 has its veins appearing clearly on the skin and is something that adds an additional detail about the physical 

00:00:59.927 --> 00:01:07.534
 and this is a hallmark of advanced bodybuilders, this comes with time, with muscular maturity, years of training. 

00:01:07.534 --> 00:01:12.372
 There are some criteria that determine how much vascularity you will have. 

00:01:12.639 --> 00:01:15.242
 One of these factors is unfortunately genetics. 

00:01:15.242 --> 00:01:17.311
 So you have to have the right parent. 

00:01:17.311 --> 00:01:22.416
 But there are things you can do, no matter what to increase vascularity 

00:01:22.416 --> 00:01:29.656
 the veins jump out, as they say, if this is something you want to add to your physique. 

00:01:29.656 --> 00:01:34.294
 One of the most important things is the type of workout you have. 

00:01:34.294 --> 00:01:38.198
 I think it's very important that you train hard and train intensely 

00:01:38.198 --> 00:01:43.640
 because when you do this, the muscles are pressed and with that muscular stress the blood pressure increases 

00:01:43.637 --> 00:01:49.210
 the veins expand which make them larger and more visible. 

00:01:49.209 --> 00:01:55.950
 So the workout you are doing is very important, heavy and intense will bring about vascularization. 

00:01:55.949 --> 00:02:04.060
 low repetitions, 6 reps, heavy weights and then second, at the end of a heavy workout 

00:02:04.057 --> 00:02:09.860
 you should do at least one series where you do high repetitions 

00:02:09.863 --> 00:02:12.970
 so let's say something between 15 and 20 repetitions. 

00:02:12.966 --> 00:02:14.970
 So let's get biceps as an example. 

00:02:14.968 --> 00:02:26.310
 I make my thong with a lot of weight, of 6 to 8 repetitions, ensuring that I have difficulty completing the last ones 

00:02:26.313 --> 00:02:29.350
 even forcing a few more reps with my training partner 

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:32.890
 so when I finish doing this series with the heavyweights, I go to a lighter weight 

00:02:32.886 --> 00:02:40.360
 and with this lighter weight, I do another 15 or 20 repetitions to flood the area with blood and bring vascularization. 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:48.300
 and what I do after finishing the exercise are some isometric contractions. 

00:02:48.302 --> 00:02:56.040
 and isometric contractions basically means holding the muscles under tension using a resistance to it. 

00:02:56.043 --> 00:02:59.910
 So in other words if I am training my biceps at the end of the biceps workout 

00:02:59.913 --> 00:03:06.520
 I brake my biceps in this way and I hold and force against my other arm as hard as I can 

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:11.020
 and you can already see the veins jumping out. 

00:03:11.024 --> 00:03:18.530
 And it's the same with the triceps, when I train triceps I basically hold the triceps and secure that contraction. 

00:03:18.532 --> 00:03:23.940
 Now, professional bodybuilders know how to do it instinctively because when they compete 

00:03:23.937 --> 00:03:25.100
 they are always posing. 

00:03:25.105 --> 00:03:35.120
 The most powerful weapon in terms of bringing this vascularization is to use a nitric oxide supplement 

00:03:35.115 --> 00:03:40.620
 You take these supplements before training, and our product is called "Super Charge" 

00:03:40.621 --> 00:03:48.030
 and what I have discovered is that using a good NO helps blood circulation in muscles 

00:03:48.028 --> 00:03:55.140
 increasing the arteries and veins and that is not something that will happen only during training 

00:03:55.135 --> 00:04:00.670
 but also uses the vascular apparatus to become more apparent. 

00:04:00.674 --> 00:04:07.550
 Look, you can see that the veins are well bounced. 

00:04:07.548 --> 00:04:14.020
 Let's talk about some nutritional aspects that you must do to bring about this vascularization 

00:04:12.885 --> 00:04:17.860
 Diet is very important if you only eat junk or else have a diet with high fat value 

00:04:16.123 --> 00:04:21.660
 has a high amount in simple carbohydrates, or even very high in carbohydrates 

00:04:21.662 --> 00:04:23.530
 basically you're going to look fat and stuffed 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:26.930
 and no matter what you do, it will not look vascularized 

00:04:26.934 --> 00:04:36.610
 so the diet is very important, we will see my kettle in the next tips to discover with a feeding of being 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:42.250
 For now I tell you to eat 6 small meals a day 

00:04:42.249 --> 00:04:48.760
 with high protein value, low to moderate value in complex carbohydrates, and low in fat. 

00:04:48.755 --> 00:04:56.800
 this helps to bring vascularization, burn fat and does not put too many carbohydrates that does not make you bloated 

00:04:56.797 --> 00:05:09.640
 another thing you can do is have a good nitric oxide supplement, of course I like the "Super Charge" 

00:05:09.643 --> 00:05:17.380
 and what I discovered is using a product like this is easier to bring about these vascularization. 

00:05:17.384 --> 00:05:26.730
 Nitric Oxide opens the arteries, veins, increases blood circulation and thereby a vascularized appearance.
