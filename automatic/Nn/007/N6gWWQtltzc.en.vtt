seven-spoke wheel and the ethic maguey 5

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:19.290 
seven-spoke wheel and the ethic maguey 5
spoke<00:00:16.279> wheel<00:00:16.720> both<00:00:17.720> these<00:00:17.990> wheels<00:00:18.290> come<00:00:18.770> in

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:19.300 
spoke wheel both these wheels come in

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.909 
spoke wheel both these wheels come in
100<00:00:20.300> millimeters<00:00:20.930> and<00:00:21.320> they<00:00:21.590> both<00:00:21.739> have

00:00:21.909 --> 00:00:21.919 
100 millimeters and they both have

00:00:21.919 --> 00:00:23.650 
100 millimeters and they both have
pretty<00:00:22.160> sweet<00:00:22.430> colorways<00:00:22.939> this<00:00:23.210> has<00:00:23.419> the

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:23.660 
pretty sweet colorways this has the

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:26.889 
pretty sweet colorways this has the
black<00:00:23.899> core<00:00:24.820> hold<00:00:25.820> the<00:00:25.939> black<00:00:26.149> spokes<00:00:26.630> with

00:00:26.889 --> 00:00:26.899 
black core hold the black spokes with

00:00:26.899 --> 00:00:28.929 
black core hold the black spokes with
the<00:00:27.050> gold<00:00:27.320> outside<00:00:27.950> of<00:00:28.099> the<00:00:28.160> core<00:00:28.399> and<00:00:28.700> then

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:28.939 
the gold outside of the core and then

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:31.269 
the gold outside of the core and then
the<00:00:29.059> black<00:00:29.270> urethane<00:00:29.840> which<00:00:30.739> looks<00:00:31.070> really

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:31.279 
the black urethane which looks really

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:34.380 
the black urethane which looks really
cool<00:00:31.579> in<00:00:31.759> my<00:00:31.790> opinion<00:00:32.360> that<00:00:32.390> has<00:00:32.720> the<00:00:32.989> 5<00:00:33.200> spokes

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:34.390 
cool in my opinion that has the 5 spokes

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:37.030 
cool in my opinion that has the 5 spokes
but<00:00:35.390> they're<00:00:35.660> thinner<00:00:35.960> spokes<00:00:36.380> as<00:00:36.620> opposed<00:00:36.950> to

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:37.040 
but they're thinner spokes as opposed to

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.030 
but they're thinner spokes as opposed to
other<00:00:37.220> 5<00:00:37.520> spoke<00:00:37.790> wheels<00:00:38.030> on<00:00:38.210> the<00:00:38.300> market<00:00:38.750> and

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:39.040 
other 5 spoke wheels on the market and

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:42.700 
other 5 spoke wheels on the market and
then<00:00:40.040> there's<00:00:40.550> the<00:00:40.930> seven<00:00:41.930> spokes<00:00:42.230> with<00:00:42.590> the

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:42.710 
then there's the seven spokes with the

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:45.790 
then there's the seven spokes with the
kind<00:00:42.950> of<00:00:43.130> I<00:00:43.520> would<00:00:44.300> say<00:00:44.480> glittery<00:00:45.050> of<00:00:45.260> silver

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:45.800 
kind of I would say glittery of silver

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.940 
kind of I would say glittery of silver
colorway<00:00:46.280> and<00:00:46.610> then<00:00:46.760> the<00:00:46.880> black<00:00:47.120> urethane<00:00:47.720> and

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:47.950 
colorway and then the black urethane and

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:51.040 
colorway and then the black urethane and
then<00:00:48.950> what's<00:00:49.880> cool<00:00:50.060> about<00:00:50.090> these<00:00:50.420> wheels<00:00:50.720> is

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:51.050 
then what's cool about these wheels is

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:55.930 
then what's cool about these wheels is
that<00:00:51.290> they're<00:00:51.530> both<00:00:51.680> 85a<00:00:52.960> so<00:00:53.960> they're<00:00:54.940> pretty

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:55.940 
that they're both 85a so they're pretty

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:58.060 
that they're both 85a so they're pretty
hard<00:00:56.270> but<00:00:56.780> they're<00:00:56.960> not<00:00:57.110> you<00:00:57.530> know<00:00:57.590> as<00:00:57.770> hard<00:00:57.950> as

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:58.070 
hard but they're not you know as hard as

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:00.069 
hard but they're not you know as hard as
some<00:00:58.250> of<00:00:58.370> the<00:00:58.460> 91<00:00:58.820> aids<00:00:59.210> out<00:00:59.450> there<00:00:59.750> anything

00:01:00.069 --> 00:01:00.079 
some of the 91 aids out there anything

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:02.020 
some of the 91 aids out there anything
so<00:01:00.860> that<00:01:00.980> they<00:01:01.160> still<00:01:01.430> grip<00:01:01.670> they<00:01:01.880> have<00:01:02.000> a

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:02.030 
so that they still grip they have a

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:05.710 
so that they still grip they have a
really<00:01:02.270> high<00:01:02.570> rebound<00:01:02.899> and<00:01:03.649> they<00:01:04.339> run<00:01:04.720> pretty

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:05.720 
really high rebound and they run pretty

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:07.660 
really high rebound and they run pretty
quick<00:01:06.110> Kevon<00:01:06.560> demand<00:01:06.890> from<00:01:07.040> ethic<00:01:07.340> really

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:07.670 
quick Kevon demand from ethic really

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:09.700 
quick Kevon demand from ethic really
takes<00:01:07.939> in<00:01:08.120> time<00:01:08.390> to<00:01:08.630> add<00:01:08.780> the<00:01:08.990> little<00:01:09.170> details

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:09.710 
takes in time to add the little details

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:54.610 
the wheels is that on the box

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:58.719 
the wheels is that on the box
for<00:01:55.610> both<00:01:55.760> of<00:01:56.000> them<00:01:56.210> it<00:01:56.479> reads<00:01:57.159> you<00:01:58.159> can<00:01:58.460> die

00:01:58.719 --> 00:01:58.729 
for both of them it reads you can die

00:01:58.729 --> 00:01:59.920 
for both of them it reads you can die
with<00:01:58.760> scooters

00:01:59.920 --> 00:01:59.930 
with scooters

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:05.700 
with scooters
be<00:02:00.170> wise<00:02:00.409> we<00:02:00.920> are<00:02:01.040> not<00:02:01.220> responsible<00:02:03.670> so<00:02:04.670> I

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:05.710 
be wise we are not responsible so I

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:08.139 
be wise we are not responsible so I
think<00:02:06.710> what<00:02:07.070> they're<00:02:07.159> trying<00:02:07.220> to<00:02:07.549> say<00:02:07.850> is<00:02:07.909> that

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149 
think what they're trying to say is that

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:11.259 
think what they're trying to say is that
these<00:02:08.269> wheels<00:02:08.569> are<00:02:08.840> so<00:02:09.110> fast<00:02:09.470> you<00:02:09.739> can<00:02:09.920> die<00:02:10.269> but

00:02:11.259 --> 00:02:11.269 
these wheels are so fast you can die but

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:14.559 
these wheels are so fast you can die but
I'm<00:02:12.230> not<00:02:12.529> quite<00:02:12.769> sure<00:02:12.889> either<00:02:13.879> way<00:02:14.269> be
