00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
trying to say on Twitter and my facebook

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:19.920 
trying to say on Twitter and my facebook

page when I'm going to live stream and

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:21.540 
page when I'm going to live stream and
that's<00:02:20.319> an<00:02:20.440> easy<00:02:20.709> way<00:02:20.950> of<00:02:20.980> dis<00:02:21.190> updating

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
because it's a quick status update and

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:25.559 
because it's a quick status update and
twitter<00:02:24.069> is<00:02:24.190> quite<00:02:24.430> useful<00:02:24.550> that<00:02:24.910> but<00:02:25.239> don't

00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:25.569
