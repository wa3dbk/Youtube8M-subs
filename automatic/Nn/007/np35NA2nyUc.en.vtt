00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
there are the different masks that you

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.780 
there are the different masks that you
can<00:01:25.200> adjust<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:26.009> inside<00:01:26.340> not<00:01:26.549> the<00:01:26.580> outside

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
can adjust the inside not the outside

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.359 
can adjust the inside not the outside
mask<00:01:27.420> you<00:01:28.080> can<00:01:28.229> set<00:01:28.380> the<00:01:28.470> softness<00:01:28.979> color

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
will that might be a better option if so

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.719 
will that might be a better option if so

mask make sure your stopwatch is
selected<00:03:21.220> and<00:03:21.370> animate<00:03:22.300> the<00:03:22.510> nodes

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:25.300 
separately make sure that you don't just

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:27.060 
separately make sure that you don't just
take<00:03:25.989> the<00:03:26.200> mask<00:03:26.410> and<00:03:26.620> move<00:03:26.770> it<00:03:26.920> because

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:27.070 
take the mask and move it because

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:28.500 
take the mask and move it because
that'll<00:03:27.670> actually<00:03:27.880> move<00:03:28.239> your<00:03:28.270> entire

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
that'll actually move your entire

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290 
composition it shows we said that this

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:43.100 
composition it shows we said that this
is<00:03:35.500> really<00:03:36.010> rough

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:43.110 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:45.000 

okay<00:03:44.110> so<00:03:44.350> that's<00:03:44.500> done

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.010 
okay so that's done

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:46.800 
okay so that's done
but<00:03:45.160> our<00:03:45.370> candles<00:03:45.760> not<00:03:45.850> giving<00:03:46.180> off<00:03:46.300> any<00:03:46.540> light

we'll<00:03:47.739> fix<00:03:47.980> that<00:03:48.070> go<00:03:48.790> to<00:03:48.850> layer<00:03:49.239> new<00:03:49.540> solid<00:03:50.200> and

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:50.950 
we'll fix that go to layer new solid and

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:57.800 
we'll fix that go to layer new solid and

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:27.330 
solid so just adjust accordingly now

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:28.430 
solid so just adjust accordingly now
because<00:04:27.570> you<00:04:27.660> have<00:04:27.780> your<00:04:27.900> candle<00:04:28.200> footage

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:28.440 
because you have your candle footage

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:30.140 
because you have your candle footage
already<00:04:28.680> positioned<00:04:29.010> you<00:04:29.340> can<00:04:29.490> just<00:04:29.700> use<00:04:30.000> the

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:30.150 
already positioned you can just use the

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:33.320 
already positioned you can just use the
pick<00:04:30.390> whip<00:04:30.570> to<00:04:31.310> position<00:04:32.310> this<00:04:32.460> solid<00:04:33.090> along

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:33.330 
pick whip to position this solid along

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:37.100 
pick whip to position this solid along
with<00:04:33.600> that<00:04:34.850> make<00:04:35.850> sure<00:04:35.910> the<00:04:36.240> Anchor<00:04:36.630> Point<00:04:36.660> is

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:37.110 
with that make sure the Anchor Point is

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:38.990 
with that make sure the Anchor Point is
the<00:04:37.140> same<00:04:37.590> though<00:04:37.800> if<00:04:38.430> you<00:04:38.640> reveal<00:04:38.970> the

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:39.000 
the same though if you reveal the

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.940 
the same though if you reveal the
transform<00:04:39.720> properties<00:04:40.200> of<00:04:40.350> your<00:04:40.470> layer<00:04:40.680> you

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:40.950 
transform properties of your layer you

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:42.380 
transform properties of your layer you
can<00:04:41.070> adjust<00:04:41.400> it<00:04:41.490> there<00:04:41.820> and<00:04:41.970> your<00:04:42.090> anchor

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:42.390 
can adjust it there and your anchor

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:44.420 
can adjust it there and your anchor
point<00:04:42.419> or<00:04:43.140> you<00:04:43.680> can<00:04:43.830> use<00:04:43.950> the<00:04:44.100> Anchor<00:04:44.400> Point

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:44.430 
point or you can use the Anchor Point

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:47.300 
point or you can use the Anchor Point
tool<00:04:44.840> if<00:04:45.840> you<00:04:46.080> want<00:04:46.260> to<00:04:46.320> change<00:04:46.470> color<00:04:46.830> go<00:04:47.250> to

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:47.310 
tool if you want to change color go to

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:50.450 
tool if you want to change color go to
effect<00:04:47.790> color<00:04:48.240> correction<00:04:48.360> curves<00:04:49.260> and<00:04:49.590> you

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:50.460 
effect color correction curves and you

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:51.800 
effect color correction curves and you
can<00:04:50.610> make<00:04:50.729> it<00:04:50.820> more<00:04:50.910> orangie<00:04:51.390> by<00:04:51.600> maybe

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:51.810 
can make it more orangie by maybe

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:53.810 
can make it more orangie by maybe
lowering<00:04:52.260> the<00:04:52.410> blue<00:04:52.650> stuff<00:04:53.100> like<00:04:53.220> that<00:04:53.400> up<00:04:53.640> the

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:53.820 
lowering the blue stuff like that up the

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:56.870 
lowering the blue stuff like that up the
contrast<00:04:54.360> whatever<00:04:54.810> you<00:04:54.870> like<00:04:55.080> and<00:04:55.520> and<00:04:56.520> off

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:56.880 
contrast whatever you like and and off

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:00.500 
contrast whatever you like and and off
by<00:04:57.330> cutting<00:04:57.900> off<00:04:58.290> your<00:04:58.320> layer<00:04:58.889> so<00:04:59.430> boom<00:04:59.760> the

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:00.510 
by cutting off your layer so boom the

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:03.110 
by cutting off your layer so boom the
flames<00:05:00.750> are<00:05:00.840> gone<00:05:01.020> but<00:05:01.669> something<00:05:02.669> is<00:05:02.760> still

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:03.120 
flames are gone but something is still

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:05.810 
flames are gone but something is still
missing<00:05:03.590> smoke<00:05:04.590> even<00:05:05.190> though<00:05:05.370> something<00:05:05.640> is

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:05.820 
missing smoke even though something is

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:07.520 
missing smoke even though something is
not<00:05:05.970> physically<00:05:06.390> burning<00:05:06.810> the<00:05:07.110> smoke<00:05:07.350> will

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:07.530 
not physically burning the smoke will

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:08.870 
not physically burning the smoke will
just<00:05:07.710> add<00:05:07.860> a<00:05:07.890> little<00:05:08.280> bit<00:05:08.580> of<00:05:08.610> realism

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:08.880 
just add a little bit of realism

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:11.690 
just add a little bit of realism
hopefully<00:05:09.810> now<00:05:10.290> the<00:05:10.350> smoke<00:05:10.740> I<00:05:10.890> use<00:05:11.100> the<00:05:11.430> small

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:11.700 
hopefully now the smoke I use the small

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:13.610 
hopefully now the smoke I use the small
little<00:05:11.880> wisp<00:05:12.180> is<00:05:12.419> also<00:05:12.900> available<00:05:13.050> on<00:05:13.350> After

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:13.620

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:43.550 
and a position in accordingly I scaled

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:46.120

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:48.530 
opacity keyframes I made it fade out

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:51.220 
opacity keyframes I made it fade out
very<00:05:49.040> slow<00:05:49.490> so<00:05:49.880> I<00:05:49.910> set<00:05:50.390> my<00:05:50.510> keyframe<00:05:50.900> to<00:05:51.110> you

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:51.230 
very slow so I set my keyframe to you

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:53.380 
very slow so I set my keyframe to you
know<00:05:51.290> maybe<00:05:51.500> if<00:05:51.950> it<00:05:52.130> was<00:05:52.220> 100<00:05:52.730> percent<00:05:53.030> a

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:53.390 
know maybe if it was 100 percent a

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:56.470 
know maybe if it was 100 percent a
second<00:05:53.870> or<00:05:53.990> two<00:05:54.110> later<00:05:54.140> it<00:05:54.650> turns<00:05:55.010> to<00:05:55.280> 0%<00:05:55.820> now

00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:56.480 
second or two later it turns to 0% now

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:57.820 
second or two later it turns to 0% now
once<00:05:56.690> you're<00:05:56.780> positioned<00:05:57.200> it<00:05:57.320> and<00:05:57.500> everything

00:05:57.820 --> 00:05:57.830 
once you're positioned it and everything

00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:59.470 
once you're positioned it and everything
for<00:05:58.040> the<00:05:58.100> one<00:05:58.220> side<00:05:58.430> do<00:05:58.850> the<00:05:59.030> same<00:05:59.240> for<00:05:59.390> the

00:05:59.470 --> 00:05:59.480 
for the one side do the same for the

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:02.080 
for the one side do the same for the
other<00:05:59.600> side<00:05:59.690> what<00:06:00.470> I<00:06:00.500> did<00:06:00.830> though<00:06:01.070> not<00:06:01.790> to<00:06:01.940> show

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:02.090 
other side what I did though not to show

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:04.960 
other side what I did though not to show
that<00:06:02.270> it's<00:06:02.420> a<00:06:02.480> mirror<00:06:02.780> is<00:06:02.990> I<00:06:03.350> just<00:06:03.670> offset<00:06:04.670> the

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:04.970 
that it's a mirror is I just offset the

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:06.250 
that it's a mirror is I just offset the
time<00:06:05.180> a<00:06:05.210> little<00:06:05.540> bit<00:06:05.630> so<00:06:05.750> I<00:06:05.780> scrub<00:06:06.080> through

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:06.260 
time a little bit so I scrub through

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.350 
time a little bit so I scrub through
more<00:06:06.500> footage<00:06:06.860> and<00:06:07.040> use<00:06:07.610> a<00:06:07.640> different<00:06:07.970> part<00:06:08.210> of

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:08.360 
more footage and use a different part of

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:11.080 
more footage and use a different part of
it<00:06:08.510> and<00:06:08.660> again<00:06:09.230> the<00:06:09.710> opacity<00:06:10.220> if<00:06:10.580> you<00:06:10.700> do<00:06:10.940> it

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:11.090 
it and again the opacity if you do it

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:13.450 
it and again the opacity if you do it
correctly<00:06:11.180> the<00:06:11.930> smoke<00:06:12.200> will<00:06:12.350> appear<00:06:12.680> properly

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:13.460 
correctly the smoke will appear properly

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:16.030 
correctly the smoke will appear properly
and<00:06:13.780> again<00:06:14.780> you<00:06:14.900> can<00:06:15.020> just<00:06:15.140> make<00:06:15.380> it<00:06:15.500> fade<00:06:15.860> out

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:16.040 
and again you can just make it fade out

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:18.010 
and again you can just make it fade out
now<00:06:16.250> the<00:06:16.340> smoke<00:06:16.730> doesn't<00:06:17.150> look<00:06:17.450> right<00:06:17.630> you<00:06:17.870> can

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:18.020 
now the smoke doesn't look right you can

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:20.290 
now the smoke doesn't look right you can
fix<00:06:18.380> it<00:06:18.560> by<00:06:18.860> using<00:06:19.190> different<00:06:19.670> blending<00:06:20.060> modes

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:20.300 
fix it by using different blending modes

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:22.570 
fix it by using different blending modes
or<00:06:20.810> you<00:06:21.260> can<00:06:21.410> go<00:06:21.560> to<00:06:21.620> effect<00:06:22.160> color<00:06:22.490> correction

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:22.580 
or you can go to effect color correction

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:24.940 
or you can go to effect color correction
curves<00:06:23.210> and<00:06:23.720> use<00:06:23.930> the<00:06:24.110> Alpha<00:06:24.470> Channel<00:06:24.830> to

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:24.950 
curves and use the Alpha Channel to

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:26.830 
curves and use the Alpha Channel to
really<00:06:25.250> change<00:06:25.490> the<00:06:25.730> brightness<00:06:25.940> or<00:06:26.360> how<00:06:26.570> much

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:26.840 
really change the brightness or how much

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:28.930 
really change the brightness or how much
smoke<00:06:27.170> you<00:06:27.320> actually<00:06:27.650> see<00:06:27.950> and<00:06:28.580> after<00:06:28.730> all

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:28.940 
smoke you actually see and after all

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:30.910 
smoke you actually see and after all
that<00:06:29.150> this<00:06:29.630> is<00:06:29.810> what<00:06:29.960> I<00:06:29.990> ended<00:06:30.350> up<00:06:30.470> with<00:06:30.530> it

00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:30.920 
that this is what I ended up with it

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:35.080 
that this is what I ended up with it
sporadically<00:06:31.730> produced<00:06:32.450> fire<00:06:32.800> yeah<00:06:34.090> still

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:35.090 
sporadically produced fire yeah still

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:37.570 
sporadically produced fire yeah still
thinking<00:06:35.420> that<00:06:35.570> what<00:06:35.690> happened<00:06:36.040> but<00:06:37.040> okay<00:06:37.280> it

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:37.580 
thinking that what happened but okay it

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:40.090 
thinking that what happened but okay it
was<00:06:37.700> cool<00:06:37.940> at<00:06:38.060> first
