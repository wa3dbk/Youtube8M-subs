00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.280 
here for no fault it stops all fall
damage<00:03:20.579> so<00:03:20.760> pretty<00:03:21.060> simple<00:03:21.450> then<00:03:21.900> here<00:03:22.109> we

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
damage so pretty simple then here we

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.259 
damage so pretty simple then here we
have<00:03:22.319> keybinds<00:03:22.920> so<00:03:23.280> here<00:03:23.459> you<00:03:23.609> can<00:03:23.760> edit<00:03:23.970> the

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269 
have keybinds so here you can edit the

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
key bands of every single hack as you

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.280 
key bands of every single hack as you
can<00:03:26.519> see<00:03:26.700> I'm<00:03:26.910> also<00:03:27.239> that<00:03:27.540> you<00:03:27.690> can<00:03:27.870> edit<00:03:28.049> each

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.289 
can see I'm also that you can edit each
UI<00:03:28.500> key<00:03:28.889> so<00:03:29.220> if<00:03:29.280> you<00:03:29.400> don't<00:03:29.639> want<00:03:29.850> to<00:03:29.970> have<00:03:30.150> it

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:30.299 
UI key so if you don't want to have it

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:32.180

on<00:03:30.480> the<00:03:30.569> right<00:03:30.750> shift<00:03:30.959> key<00:03:31.200> just<00:03:31.530> edited<00:03:32.010> here

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
on the right shift key just edited here

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.550 
on the right shift key just edited here
so<00:03:32.549> all<00:03:32.670> you<00:03:32.790> have<00:03:32.970> to<00:03:33.000> do<00:03:33.239> is<00:03:33.420> just<00:03:34.019> mark<00:03:34.319> the

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:40.069 
hack go to clear and reassign a new key
for<00:03:37.530> instance<00:03:38.239> okay<00:03:39.239> then<00:03:39.540> here<00:03:39.720> we've<00:03:39.840> play

right<00:04:23.280> side<00:04:23.520> we<00:04:23.669> have<00:04:23.700> waypoints<00:04:24.450> so<00:04:24.960> you<00:04:25.050> can

00:04:25.339 --> 00:04:25.349 
right side we have waypoints so you can

00:04:25.349 --> 00:04:27.260 
right side we have waypoints so you can
add<00:04:25.590> waypoints<00:04:26.340> if<00:04:26.460> you<00:04:26.580> want<00:04:26.789> to<00:04:26.970> then<00:04:27.240> you

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270 
add waypoints if you want to then you

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:27.530 
add waypoints if you want to then you
get

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:27.540 
get

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:28.850 
get
this<00:04:27.690> little<00:04:27.930> window<00:04:28.290> here<00:04:28.320> where<00:04:28.740> you<00:04:28.830> have

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:28.860 
this little window here where you have

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:30.830 
this little window here where you have
to<00:04:29.160> enter<00:04:29.550> the<00:04:29.580> name<00:04:29.700> of<00:04:30.000> the<00:04:30.090> waypoint<00:04:30.720> and

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:30.840 
to enter the name of the waypoint and

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:32.960 
to enter the name of the waypoint and
you<00:04:31.470> can<00:04:31.650> also<00:04:31.800> adjust<00:04:32.040> the<00:04:32.370> color<00:04:32.670> of<00:04:32.850> the

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:32.970 
you can also adjust the color of the

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:33.530 
you can also adjust the color of the
waypoint

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:33.540 
waypoint

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:36.200 
waypoint
so<00:04:34.050> let's<00:04:34.290> make<00:04:34.620> this<00:04:34.860> waypoint<00:04:35.370> here<00:04:35.580> red<00:04:35.850> and

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:36.210 
so let's make this waypoint here red and

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:38.510 
so let's make this waypoint here red and
then<00:04:37.020> just<00:04:37.290> go<00:04:37.470> to<00:04:37.500> add<00:04:37.800> and<00:04:38.070> then<00:04:38.250> you<00:04:38.370> have

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:38.520 
then just go to add and then you have

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:39.830 
then just go to add and then you have
here<00:04:38.760> a<00:04:38.910> little<00:04:39.150> Waypoint

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:39.840 
here a little Waypoint

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:41.810 
here a little Waypoint
at<00:04:39.930> the<00:04:40.230> point<00:04:40.440> where<00:04:40.740> you<00:04:40.830> were<00:04:41.040> standing<00:04:41.610> and

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:41.820 
at the point where you were standing and

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:44.300 
at the point where you were standing and
this<00:04:42.210> also<00:04:42.480> traces<00:04:42.840> right<00:04:43.410> from<00:04:43.650> you<00:04:43.830> to<00:04:44.160> the

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:44.310 
this also traces right from you to the

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:46.610 
this also traces right from you to the
waypoints<00:04:44.910> you<00:04:45.030> can<00:04:45.240> easily<00:04:45.510> find<00:04:46.110> it<00:04:46.320> over

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:46.620 
waypoints you can easily find it over

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:48.770 
waypoints you can easily find it over
the<00:04:46.740> whole<00:04:46.920> map<00:04:47.160> this<00:04:47.640> tracer<00:04:48.000> works<00:04:48.420> on<00:04:48.630> the

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:48.780 
the whole map this tracer works on the

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:50.300 
the whole map this tracer works on the
whole<00:04:48.960> map<00:04:49.200> so<00:04:49.440> also<00:04:49.740> if<00:04:49.830> you<00:04:49.920> have<00:04:50.010> ten

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:50.310 
whole map so also if you have ten

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:52.340 
whole map so also if you have ten
thousand<00:04:50.700> blocks<00:04:51.060> away<00:04:51.270> from<00:04:51.750> this<00:04:51.870> Waypoint

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:52.350 
thousand blocks away from this Waypoint
