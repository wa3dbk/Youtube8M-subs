just cuz there's some on the side and

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.740 
just cuz there's some on the side and
because<00:03:08.980> I<00:03:09.040> have<00:03:09.159> calyx<00:03:09.640> like<00:03:09.909> the<00:03:10.030> hairs<00:03:10.239> it

because I have calyx like the hairs it

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:13.559 
because I have calyx like the hairs it
goes<00:03:10.989> that<00:03:11.260> way<00:03:11.640> so<00:03:12.640> the<00:03:12.790> dread<00:03:13.000> wants<00:03:13.359> to<00:03:13.450> go
