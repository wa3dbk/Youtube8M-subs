essentially what happens is everyone has
a<00:02:00.460> deck<00:02:00.670> of<00:02:00.700> cards<00:02:00.850> and<00:02:01.240> they<00:02:01.869> basically<00:02:02.380> one

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:02.590 
a deck of cards and they basically one

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:03.120 
a deck of cards and they basically one

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.130 
at a time

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:05.790 
at a time
flip<00:02:03.550> them<00:02:03.760> in<00:02:03.970> front<00:02:04.660> of<00:02:04.750> each<00:02:04.869> other<00:02:05.050> like

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:05.800 
flip them in front of each other like

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.260 
flip them in front of each other like
this<00:02:06.009> so<00:02:06.220> this<00:02:06.340> play<00:02:06.490> would<00:02:06.670> play<00:02:06.790> a<00:02:06.820> card<00:02:07.119> and

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.270 
this so this play would play a card and

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:09.030 
this so this play would play a card and
this<00:02:07.420> player<00:02:07.660> would<00:02:07.810> play<00:02:07.840> a<00:02:07.990> card<00:02:08.290> and<00:02:08.649> then

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:09.040 
this player would play a card and then

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:10.680 
this player would play a card and then
so<00:02:09.220> with<00:02:09.340> the<00:02:09.429> next<00:02:09.700> one<00:02:09.850> and<00:02:10.060> this<00:02:10.450> would

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
so with the next one and this would

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:13.680 
so with the next one and this would
continue<00:02:11.290> until<00:02:11.820> someone<00:02:12.820> plays<00:02:13.000> a<00:02:13.030> card<00:02:13.420> that

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
continue until someone plays a card that

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:17.160 
continue until someone plays a card that
matches<00:02:14.650> one<00:02:15.310> of<00:02:15.340> the<00:02:15.430> other<00:02:15.610> cards<00:02:16.180> that<00:02:16.959> are

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
matches one of the other cards that are

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:18.660 
matches one of the other cards that are
out<00:02:17.320> here<00:02:17.350> so<00:02:17.830> this<00:02:17.950> would<00:02:18.100> continue<00:02:18.550> and

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
out here so this would continue and

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:20.640 
out here so this would continue and
sometimes<00:02:19.300> it<00:02:19.870> could<00:02:19.989> take<00:02:20.170> a<00:02:20.200> little<00:02:20.470> bit

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
sometimes it could take a little bit

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.550 
sometimes it could take a little bit
there<00:02:21.070> so<00:02:21.940> we<00:02:22.060> have<00:02:22.209> this<00:02:22.420> boom<00:02:22.810> these<00:02:23.290> two

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
there so we have this boom these two

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.040 
there so we have this boom these two
match<00:02:23.769> as<00:02:24.010> soon<00:02:24.640> as<00:02:24.790> these<00:02:25.000> two<00:02:25.360> match<00:02:25.630> used<00:02:25.959> to

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050 
match as soon as these two match used to

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:28.350 
match as soon as these two match used to
would<00:02:26.140> try<00:02:26.320> to<00:02:26.380> race<00:02:26.769> to<00:02:27.250> say<00:02:27.519> to<00:02:27.580> basically

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
would try to race to say to basically

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.240 
would try to race to say to basically
make<00:02:28.660> the<00:02:28.930> other<00:02:29.110> animal<00:02:29.560> noise<00:02:29.739> of<00:02:30.070> the

of all the cards in their deck that
person<00:03:20.829> is

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:21.460 
person is

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:23.760 
person is
the<00:03:21.550> winner<00:03:21.810> there's<00:03:22.810> another<00:03:23.140> variant<00:03:23.650> an

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:23.770 
the winner there's another variant an

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:25.530

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 
the middle there and as things go on and

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:31.080 
the middle there and as things go on and
as<00:03:29.230> cars<00:03:29.530> are<00:03:29.680> getting<00:03:29.920> dealt<00:03:30.190> out<00:03:30.370> one<00:03:30.910> of<00:03:31.000> the

as cars are getting dealt out one of the

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:34.140 
as cars are getting dealt out one of the
time<00:03:31.330> if<00:03:31.720> when<00:03:32.440> a<00:03:32.830> card<00:03:33.250> matches<00:03:33.730> someone<00:03:34.000> else

time if when a card matches someone else

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:35.400 
time if when a card matches someone else
so<00:03:34.300> let's<00:03:34.480> say<00:03:34.600> this<00:03:34.690> one<00:03:34.870> puts<00:03:35.050> a<00:03:35.110> hee-haw

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:35.410 
so let's say this one puts a hee-haw

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:38.490 
so let's say this one puts a hee-haw
this<00:03:36.010> is<00:03:36.160> this<00:03:36.400> this<00:03:37.090> is<00:03:37.150> hoot<00:03:37.540> this<00:03:38.020> is<00:03:38.260> this

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:38.500 
this is this this is hoot this is this

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:40.230 
this is this this is hoot this is this
and<00:03:38.680> let's<00:03:38.800> say<00:03:38.920> this<00:03:39.160> person<00:03:39.430> does<00:03:39.670> hee-haw

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:40.240 
and let's say this person does hee-haw

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:42.240 
and let's say this person does hee-haw
once<00:03:40.750> these<00:03:41.020> perc<00:03:41.350> people<00:03:41.680> do<00:03:41.800> their<00:03:41.980> thing

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:42.250 
once these perc people do their thing

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:46.200 
once these perc people do their thing
this<00:03:42.700> one<00:03:43.000> says<00:03:44.340> this<00:03:45.340> guy<00:03:45.520> maybe<00:03:45.760> he<00:03:45.880> had<00:03:46.000> said

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:46.210 
this one says this guy maybe he had said

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:48.780 
this one says this guy maybe he had said
who<00:03:46.360> and<00:03:47.170> so<00:03:47.710> this<00:03:47.860> guy<00:03:48.010> would<00:03:48.190> put<00:03:48.340> this<00:03:48.460> cards

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790 
who and so this guy would put this cards

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:51.480 
who and so this guy would put this cards
here<00:03:49.000> because<00:03:49.870> it<00:03:49.960> matched<00:03:50.200> this<00:03:50.560> everybody

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:51.490 
here because it matched this everybody

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:56.070 
here because it matched this everybody
would<00:03:52.030> take<00:03:52.300> their<00:03:52.600> card<00:03:52.900> and<00:03:53.170> pass<00:03:54.070> it<00:03:54.370> to<00:03:55.180> the

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:56.080 
would take their card and pass it to the

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:58.680 
would take their card and pass it to the
left<00:03:56.110> and<00:03:56.800> so<00:03:57.130> it<00:03:57.250> gets<00:03:57.400> a<00:03:57.520> lot<00:03:57.730> harder<00:03:58.120> to

00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:58.690 
left and so it gets a lot harder to

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:00.120 
left and so it gets a lot harder to
remember<00:03:58.870> who<00:03:59.230> is<00:03:59.410> who<00:03:59.440> and<00:03:59.800> that's<00:03:59.950> the

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:00.130 
remember who is who and that's the

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:02.130 
remember who is who and that's the
advanced<00:04:00.520> version<00:04:00.760> of<00:04:00.970> the<00:04:01.030> game<00:04:01.210> now<00:04:02.050> the

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:02.140 
advanced version of the game now the

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:03.270 
advanced version of the game now the
best<00:04:02.320> way<00:04:02.470> to<00:04:02.530> get<00:04:02.650> a<00:04:02.680> feel<00:04:02.830> for<00:04:03.010> what<00:04:03.130> this

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:03.280
