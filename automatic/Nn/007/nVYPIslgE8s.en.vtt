online friend of mine Michael he had
requested<00:00:05.910> that<00:00:06.210> I<00:00:06.359> do<00:00:06.480> another<00:00:07.049> tutorial

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:07.589 
requested that I do another tutorial

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:09.169 
requested that I do another tutorial
another<00:00:07.950> instructional<00:00:08.519> video<00:00:08.760> on<00:00:08.820> the<00:00:09.030> bout

another instructional video on the bout

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:12.530 
another instructional video on the bout
saw<00:00:09.420> so<00:00:10.290> I<00:00:10.320> thought<00:00:10.679> I<00:00:10.710> would<00:00:10.860> show<00:00:11.540> show

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
saw so I thought I would show show

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.379 
saw so I thought I would show show
everyone<00:00:12.809> how<00:00:12.960> to<00:00:12.990> do<00:00:13.170> the<00:00:13.320> y2k<00:00:13.559> rollover

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:14.389 
everyone how to do the y2k rollover

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:17.510 
everyone how to do the y2k rollover
which<00:00:15.389> is<00:00:15.540> basically<00:00:15.929> just<00:00:16.080> a<00:00:16.440> vertical<00:00:16.680> roll

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
which is basically just a vertical roll

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.349 
which is basically just a vertical roll
over<00:00:17.789> the<00:00:17.910> thumb<00:00:19.699> to<00:00:20.699> start<00:00:20.939> off<00:00:21.029> this<00:00:21.180> move

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
over the thumb to start off this move

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:22.849 
over the thumb to start off this move
I'm<00:00:21.510> actually<00:00:21.930> going<00:00:22.170> to<00:00:22.230> break<00:00:22.380> it<00:00:22.529> down<00:00:22.619> in<00:00:22.800> a

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
I'm actually going to break it down in a

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.279 
I'm actually going to break it down in a
couple<00:00:23.039> couple<00:00:23.820> simpler<00:00:24.269> parts<00:00:24.630> and<00:00:24.900> then

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
couple couple simpler parts and then

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:26.420 
couple couple simpler parts and then
eventually<00:00:25.529> you<00:00:25.859> could<00:00:25.949> put<00:00:26.130> it<00:00:26.189> all<00:00:26.250> together

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
eventually you could put it all together

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.870 
eventually you could put it all together
to<00:00:27.180> make<00:00:27.660> to<00:00:27.990> make<00:00:28.080> you<00:00:28.230> move<00:00:28.590> more<00:00:28.830> fluent<00:00:29.279> on

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
to make to make you move more fluent on

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.880 
to make to make you move more fluent on
the<00:00:30.119> start<00:00:30.390> off<00:00:30.539> you<00:00:31.050> want<00:00:31.080> your<00:00:31.380> latch<00:00:31.590> handle

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
the start off you want your latch handle

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.250 
the start off you want your latch handle
towards<00:00:32.610> you<00:00:32.759> definitely<00:00:33.719> want<00:00:33.840> this<00:00:33.960> towards

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
towards you definitely want this towards

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.270 
towards you definitely want this towards
you<00:00:34.350> not<00:00:34.530> away<00:00:34.770> from<00:00:34.950> you

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
you not away from you

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.139 
you not away from you
to<00:00:35.489> start<00:00:35.760> off<00:00:35.880> this<00:00:36.120> move<00:00:36.329> anyway<00:00:38.030> and<00:00:39.030> you're

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
to start off this move anyway and you're

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.060 
to start off this move anyway and you're
going<00:00:39.270> to<00:00:39.329> be<00:00:39.420> pinching<00:00:39.840> with<00:00:40.649> your<00:00:40.770> pointer

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
going to be pinching with your pointer

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.400 
going to be pinching with your pointer
finger<00:00:41.340> your<00:00:41.550> thumb<00:00:41.660> the<00:00:42.660> latch<00:00:42.870> handle<00:00:43.110> or

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
finger your thumb the latch handle or

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.709 
finger your thumb the latch handle or
bite<00:00:43.680> handle<00:00:44.010> and<00:00:44.190> you<00:00:45.180> want<00:00:45.329> to<00:00:45.390> hold<00:00:45.480> it<00:00:45.660> in

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
bite handle and you want to hold it in

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:46.910 
bite handle and you want to hold it in
kind<00:00:45.840> of<00:00:45.989> an<00:00:46.079> angle<00:00:46.320> like<00:00:46.379> this<00:00:46.590> this<00:00:46.770> way

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
kind of an angle like this this way

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.650 
kind of an angle like this this way
you're<00:00:47.160> you're<00:00:47.520> safe<00:00:48.149> handle<00:00:48.480> and<00:00:48.600> blade

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
you're you're safe handle and blade

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.110 
you're you're safe handle and blade
doesn't<00:00:49.050> drop<00:00:49.230> on<00:00:49.440> you<00:00:49.590> and<00:00:49.820> for<00:00:50.820> this<00:00:50.910> move

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
doesn't drop on you and for this move

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.790 
doesn't drop on you and for this move
what<00:00:51.300> you<00:00:51.360> want<00:00:51.539> to<00:00:51.629> do<00:00:51.719> is<00:00:51.989> have<00:00:52.199> a<00:00:52.230> circular

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
what you want to do is have a circular

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.790 
what you want to do is have a circular
motion<00:00:52.949> a<00:00:53.309> forward<00:00:53.940> or<00:00:54.320> counter<00:00:55.320> clockwise

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
motion a forward or counter clockwise

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.510 
motion a forward or counter clockwise
circular<00:00:56.579> motion<00:00:56.940> and<00:00:58.129> what<00:00:59.129> you're<00:00:59.250> going<00:00:59.340> to

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
circular motion and what you're going to

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.849 
circular motion and what you're going to
be<00:00:59.609> do<00:00:59.760> doing<00:01:00.239> basically<00:01:00.660> is<00:01:00.960> pushing<00:01:01.770> this

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
be do doing basically is pushing this

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.429 
be do doing basically is pushing this
handle<00:01:02.219> down<00:01:02.370> and<00:01:02.640> as<00:01:03.329> it<00:01:03.510> has<00:01:03.600> momentum<00:01:04.140> with

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
handle down and as it has momentum with

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:05.960 
handle down and as it has momentum with
that<00:01:04.589> circular<00:01:04.949> motion<00:01:04.979> you<00:01:05.790> would<00:01:05.850> be

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
that circular motion you would be

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.859 
that circular motion you would be
letting<00:01:06.420> go<00:01:06.720> of<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:08.150> sit<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:09.299> white<00:01:09.570> handle

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
letting go of the sit the white handle

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.289 
letting go of the sit the white handle
and<00:01:10.280> the<00:01:11.280> momentum<00:01:11.490> is<00:01:11.760> going<00:01:11.880> to<00:01:11.939> bring<00:01:12.090> this

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
and the momentum is going to bring this

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.179 
and the momentum is going to bring this
safe<00:01:12.540> handle<00:01:12.900> over<00:01:13.049> your<00:01:13.229> thumb<00:01:13.439> in<00:01:13.710> which<00:01:13.950> put

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
safe handle over your thumb in which put

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:15.350 
safe handle over your thumb in which put
in<00:01:14.220> which<00:01:14.490> time<00:01:14.729> you're<00:01:14.909> going<00:01:15.090> to<00:01:15.210> be

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
in which time you're going to be

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.300 
in which time you're going to be
gripping<00:01:15.600> that<00:01:15.840> again<00:01:16.140> and<00:01:16.350> then<00:01:17.130> you're

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
gripping that again and then you're

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.740 
gripping that again and then you're
going<00:01:17.430> to<00:01:17.520> keep<00:01:17.640> getting<00:01:18.270> to<00:01:18.479> this<00:01:18.570> position

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
going to keep getting to this position

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.770 
going to keep getting to this position
here<00:01:19.290> and<00:01:20.130> then<00:01:20.189> from<00:01:20.640> here<00:01:20.939> you're<00:01:21.540> going<00:01:21.689> to

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
here and then from here you're going to

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.990 
here and then from here you're going to
lift<00:01:21.930> up<00:01:22.110> this<00:01:22.380> way<00:01:22.560> to<00:01:22.830> start<00:01:23.189> off<00:01:23.340> anyway<00:01:23.700> and

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
lift up this way to start off anyway and

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.179 
lift up this way to start off anyway and
then<00:01:24.659> eventually<00:01:24.930> from<00:01:25.409> this<00:01:25.590> position<00:01:25.799> after

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
then eventually from this position after

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.100 
then eventually from this position after
the<00:01:26.460> roll<00:01:26.610> over<00:01:26.820> itself<00:01:27.150> you<00:01:27.750> can<00:01:27.900> bring<00:01:28.049> over

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
the roll over itself you can bring over

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.609 
the roll over itself you can bring over
circular<00:01:28.920> around<00:01:29.729> the<00:01:29.850> top<00:01:30.170> to<00:01:31.170> get<00:01:31.290> to<00:01:31.500> this

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
circular around the top to get to this

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.080 
circular around the top to get to this
final<00:01:31.950> grip<00:01:32.840> so<00:01:33.840> show<00:01:34.439> you<00:01:34.500> this<00:01:34.759> how<00:01:35.759> it<00:01:35.909> looks

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
final grip so show you this how it looks

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.450 
final grip so show you this how it looks
all<00:01:36.240> together<00:01:36.619> as<00:01:37.619> you<00:01:37.799> do<00:01:37.890> it<00:01:37.979> the<00:01:38.070> roll<00:01:38.220> over

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
all together as you do it the roll over

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.350 
all together as you do it the roll over
this<00:01:38.579> way<00:01:38.790> then<00:01:39.780> circular<00:01:40.259> and<00:01:41.119> try<00:01:42.119> to<00:01:42.180> get<00:01:42.329> a

this way then circular and try to get a

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.160 
this way then circular and try to get a
little<00:01:42.479> more<00:01:42.630> fluently<00:01:43.079> fluently<00:01:44.040> done<00:01:45.170> and

little more fluently fluently done and
that's<00:01:46.290> the<00:01:46.409> final<00:01:46.619> grip<00:01:46.920> to<00:01:47.340> start<00:01:47.610> off<00:01:47.790> I

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
that's the final grip to start off I

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.590 
that's the final grip to start off I
want<00:01:48.960> to<00:01:49.110> like<00:01:49.229> you<00:01:49.259> to<00:01:50.040> do<00:01:51.030> the<00:01:51.149> roll<00:01:51.360> over

what else

00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:49.819

and pretty much dropping it I would

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:51.559 
and pretty much dropping it I would
