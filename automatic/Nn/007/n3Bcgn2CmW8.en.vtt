gradient<00:01:39.030> color<00:01:39.450> for<00:01:40.049> the<00:01:40.170> message<00:01:40.439> bubbles

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
gradient color for the message bubbles

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.499 
gradient color for the message bubbles
they're<00:01:40.950> not<00:01:41.100> all<00:01:41.340> uniform<00:01:41.970> color<00:01:42.240> and

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
they're not all uniform color and

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.420 
they're not all uniform color and
actually<00:01:43.350> don't<00:01:43.500> like<00:01:43.680> the<00:01:43.860> gradient<00:01:44.280> when

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
actually don't like the gradient when

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.240 
actually don't like the gradient when
you<00:01:44.549> alter<00:01:44.820> the<00:01:45.420> color<00:01:45.659> of<00:01:45.810> of<00:01:46.649> your<00:01:47.040> chat

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
you alter the color of of your chat

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.830 
you alter the color of of your chat
bubbles<00:01:47.670> so<00:01:48.060> i'm<00:01:48.119> going<00:01:48.240> to<00:01:48.299> turn<00:01:48.479> that<00:01:48.540> off

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
bubbles so i'm going to turn that off

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.389 
bubbles so i'm going to turn that off
i'm<00:01:49.259> going<00:01:49.439> to<00:01:49.500> go<00:01:49.560> ahead<00:01:49.619> and<00:01:49.799> swipe<00:01:50.100> up<00:01:50.280> the

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
i'm going to go ahead and swipe up the

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.010 
i'm going to go ahead and swipe up the
keel<00:01:50.640> and<00:01:50.850> then<00:01:51.299> i'm<00:01:51.420> going<00:01:51.509> to<00:01:51.600> go<00:01:51.720> back<00:01:51.750> to

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
keel and then i'm going to go back to

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.499 
keel and then i'm going to go back to
the<00:01:52.320> messages<00:01:52.829> app<00:01:52.860> and<00:01:53.250> this<00:01:53.909> is<00:01:54.210> what<00:01:54.450> it

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
the messages app and this is what it

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.240 
the messages app and this is what it
looks<00:01:54.630> like<00:01:54.720> with<00:01:54.840> the<00:01:54.960> gradient<00:01:55.290> off<00:01:55.409> it's<00:01:56.070> a

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
looks like with the gradient off it's a

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:57.950 
looks like with the gradient off it's a
subtle<00:01:56.460> effect<00:01:56.909> but<00:01:57.090> you<00:01:57.299> really<00:01:57.509> notice<00:01:57.750> it

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
subtle effect but you really notice it

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.300 
subtle effect but you really notice it
especially<00:01:58.259> when<00:01:58.560> you<00:01:58.649> have<00:01:58.799> the<00:01:58.950> phone<00:01:59.130> right

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
especially when you have the phone right

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:00.679 
especially when you have the phone right
in<00:01:59.430> front<00:01:59.579> of<00:01:59.640> your<00:01:59.729> face<00:01:59.790> or<00:02:00.420> you<00:02:00.509> have<00:02:00.659> the

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
in front of your face or you have the

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.600 
in front of your face or you have the
device<00:02:01.049> writing<00:02:01.380> from<00:02:01.500> your<00:02:01.710> face<00:02:01.890> it<00:02:02.130> looks<00:02:02.549> a

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
device writing from your face it looks a

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.670 
device writing from your face it looks a
lot<00:02:02.850> better<00:02:03.149> in<00:02:03.420> my<00:02:03.540> opinion<00:02:03.570> without<00:02:04.079> the

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
lot better in my opinion without the

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.260 
lot better in my opinion without the
gradients<00:02:05.159> now<00:02:05.549> i'm<00:02:05.610> going<00:02:05.729> to<00:02:05.850> go<00:02:06.060> ahead<00:02:06.149> and

gradients now i'm going to go ahead and

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:07.730 
gradients now i'm going to go ahead and

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
to reopen it notice how wide it looks

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.890 
to reopen it notice how wide it looks
now<00:02:52.980> see<00:02:53.640> that<00:02:53.820> see<00:02:54.060> how<00:02:54.150> wide<00:02:54.390> it<00:02:54.540> looks<00:02:54.720> when

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
now see that see how wide it looks when

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.830 
now see that see how wide it looks when
compared<00:02:55.350> with<00:02:55.440> the<00:02:55.710> wide<00:02:56.100> message<00:02:56.840> disabled

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
compared with the wide message disabled

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.840 
compared with the wide message disabled
so<00:02:58.290> that<00:02:58.620> is<00:02:58.830> the<00:02:58.860> difference<00:02:59.340> between<00:02:59.400> those

00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850 
so that is the difference between those

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:01.820 
so that is the difference between those
two<00:03:00.060> it's<00:03:00.210> sort<00:03:00.630> of<00:03:00.750> subtle<00:03:00.960> but<00:03:01.350> you<00:03:01.680> will

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
two it's sort of subtle but you will

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:03.560 
two it's sort of subtle but you will
notice<00:03:02.040> it<00:03:02.340> if<00:03:02.460> you<00:03:02.580> test<00:03:02.820> it<00:03:02.970> out<00:03:03.090> yourself

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:03.570 
notice it if you test it out yourself

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:06.230 
notice it if you test it out yourself

you'll see the tails here showing which

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:38.600 
you'll see the tails here showing which
direction<00:03:37.110> the<00:03:37.470> message<00:03:37.830> is<00:03:37.950> going<00:03:38.160> in<00:03:38.370> so<00:03:38.400> it

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:38.610 
direction the message is going in so it

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:40.960 
direction the message is going in so it
kind<00:03:38.760> of<00:03:38.820> helps<00:03:39.030> you<00:03:39.090> orientate<00:03:39.720> the

kind of helps you orientate the

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:42.860 
kind of helps you orientate the
conversation<00:03:41.970> helps<00:03:42.240> you<00:03:42.330> to<00:03:42.450> orient<00:03:42.780> the

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
conversation helps you to orient the

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:44.870 
conversation helps you to orient the
conversation<00:03:43.500> a<00:03:43.560> little<00:03:43.680> bit<00:03:43.950> so<00:03:44.370> I<00:03:44.400> do<00:03:44.520> like

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:44.880 
conversation a little bit so I do like

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:46.520 
conversation a little bit so I do like
message<00:03:45.209> tails<00:03:45.450> being<00:03:45.780> on<00:03:45.930> or<00:03:46.200> you<00:03:46.260> can<00:03:46.410> turn

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530 
message tails being on or you can turn

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:48.680 
message tails being on or you can turn
it<00:03:46.680> off<00:03:46.770> if<00:03:46.830> you<00:03:47.010> want<00:03:47.130> to<00:03:47.490> I've<00:03:48.090> just<00:03:48.120> turned

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
it off if you want to I've just turned

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:50.840 
it off if you want to I've just turned
it<00:03:48.870> off<00:03:49.020> and<00:03:49.350> this<00:03:50.160> is<00:03:50.310> what<00:03:50.430> it<00:03:50.520> looks<00:03:50.700> like

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:50.850 
it off and this is what it looks like

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:53.630 
it off and this is what it looks like
without<00:03:51.150> message<00:03:52.080> tails<00:03:52.320> again<00:03:52.500> so<00:03:52.920> there<00:03:53.459> is

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:53.640 
without message tails again so there is

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:56.150 
without message tails again so there is
the<00:03:53.790> difference<00:03:54.180> right<00:03:54.390> there<00:03:54.780> so<00:03:55.590> folks<00:03:55.890> this
