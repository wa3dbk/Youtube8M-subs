plus<00:00:35.020> somewhat<00:00:35.289> different<00:00:35.739> stick<00:00:36.310> to<00:00:36.520> the

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:36.670 
plus somewhat different stick to the

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:39.150 
plus somewhat different stick to the

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870 
takes away the stress of putting

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:53.780 
takes away the stress of putting
products<00:03:52.380> in<00:03:52.590> your<00:03:52.709> hair<00:03:52.980> and<00:03:53.220> then<00:03:53.670> you've

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:03.380 

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:08.200 

okay<00:04:04.160> mix<00:04:04.640> it<00:04:04.820> up<00:04:05.590> see<00:04:06.590> a<00:04:06.620> little<00:04:07.160> bit<00:04:07.790> of<00:04:08.000> white

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:08.210 
okay mix it up see a little bit of white

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:16.629 
okay mix it up see a little bit of white
residue<00:04:09.640> you<00:04:10.640> mix<00:04:10.910> it<00:04:11.090> some<00:04:11.270> more

00:04:16.629 --> 00:04:16.639 

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:20.740 

yet<00:04:17.359> it<00:04:17.870> is<00:04:18.079> kind<00:04:18.590> of<00:04:18.709> throwing<00:04:18.949> weight<00:04:19.629> and<00:04:20.629> it

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:20.750 
yet it is kind of throwing weight and it

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:22.659 
yet it is kind of throwing weight and it
doesn't<00:04:21.379> want<00:04:21.469> to<00:04:21.590> go<00:04:21.709> ahead<00:04:21.859> with<00:04:22.310> this

00:04:22.659 --> 00:04:22.669 
doesn't want to go ahead with this

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:25.330 
doesn't want to go ahead with this
because<00:04:22.939> it's<00:04:23.240> been<00:04:23.479> recommended<00:04:24.289> to<00:04:24.319> me<00:04:24.500> and

because it's been recommended to me and

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:26.980 
because it's been recommended to me and
it's<00:04:25.460> said<00:04:25.639> to<00:04:25.669> work<00:04:26.000> so<00:04:26.419> I'm<00:04:26.569> going<00:04:26.750> to<00:04:26.840> do

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:26.990 
it's said to work so I'm going to do

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:30.040

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:02.650 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:05.320 

measuring<00:05:03.849> anything<00:05:04.849> to<00:05:04.969> measure<00:05:05.150> these

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:05.330 
measuring anything to measure these

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:07.179 
measuring anything to measure these
products<00:05:05.659> so<00:05:05.779> what<00:05:05.930> I'm<00:05:06.020> going<00:05:06.199> to<00:05:06.229> do<00:05:06.469> is<00:05:06.800> just

products so what I'm going to do is just

00:05:07.189 --> 00:05:10.409 
products so what I'm going to do is just
use<00:05:07.639> my<00:05:07.909> judgment<00:05:08.050> it<00:05:09.050> says<00:05:09.259> to<00:05:09.439> use<00:05:09.680> one<00:05:10.009> jar

00:05:10.409 --> 00:05:10.419 
use my judgment it says to use one jar

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:13.089 
use my judgment it says to use one jar
but<00:05:11.419> I'm<00:05:11.569> just<00:05:11.779> going<00:05:11.990> to<00:05:12.050> use<00:05:12.199> a<00:05:12.229> significant

00:05:13.089 --> 00:05:13.099 
but I'm just going to use a significant

00:05:13.099 --> 00:05:20.800 
but I'm just going to use a significant
amount<00:05:13.400> say<00:05:15.219> four<00:05:16.219> blobs<00:05:16.909> of<00:05:17.150> this<00:05:18.639> gel<00:05:19.659> mix<00:05:20.659> it

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:20.810 
amount say four blobs of this gel mix it

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:28.440 
amount say four blobs of this gel mix it
and<00:05:20.930> they<00:05:21.020> say<00:05:21.229> whoa

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:28.450 

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:37.449 

so<00:05:28.990> this<00:05:29.140> is<00:05:29.320> very<00:05:29.650> very<00:05:30.310> well

00:05:37.449 --> 00:05:37.459 

00:05:37.459 --> 00:05:41.859 

four<00:05:38.459> blocks<00:05:38.789> of<00:05:38.999> that<00:05:39.209> then<00:05:39.719> the<00:05:40.110> aloe<00:05:40.499> vera
