00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.940 

can<00:00:23.140> you<00:00:23.260> dissolve<00:00:23.619> a<00:00:23.949> liquid<00:00:24.550> in<00:00:24.730> a<00:00:24.820> liquid

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:25.950 
can you dissolve a liquid in a liquid

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:28.290 
can you dissolve a liquid in a liquid
well<00:00:26.950> that's<00:00:27.400> a<00:00:27.520> great<00:00:27.700> question

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:28.300 
well that's a great question

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:34.560 
well that's a great question
try<00:00:28.599> this

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:34.570 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:37.200 

you<00:00:35.440> will<00:00:35.620> need<00:00:35.800> some<00:00:36.310> rubbing<00:00:36.640> alcohol<00:00:36.790> a

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.210 
you will need some rubbing alcohol a

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:41.069 
you will need some rubbing alcohol a
piece<00:00:37.720> of<00:00:37.930> paper<00:00:38.140> and<00:00:38.590> a<00:00:39.160> lighter<00:00:39.600> this<00:00:40.600> is<00:00:41.050> a

00:00:41.069 --> 00:00:41.079 
piece of paper and a lighter this is a

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:48.270 
piece of paper and a lighter this is a
gas<00:00:41.580> dissolved<00:00:42.580> in<00:00:42.700> a<00:00:42.790> liquid<00:00:46.680> and<00:00:47.680> this

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:48.280 
gas dissolved in a liquid and this

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.330 
gas dissolved in a liquid and this
rubbing<00:00:48.760> alcohol<00:00:48.940> is<00:00:49.600> a<00:00:49.629> liquid<00:00:50.320> dissolved<00:00:51.190> in

liquid oh yeah by the way I should
probably<00:00:53.590> tell<00:00:54.129> you<00:00:54.309> do<00:00:54.820> not<00:00:55.269> drink<00:00:56.199> the

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:56.830 
probably tell you do not drink the

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:58.979 
probably tell you do not drink the
rubbing<00:00:57.220> alcohol<00:00:57.370> I'll<00:00:58.360> tell<00:00:58.540> you<00:00:58.600> only<00:00:58.839> to

yes haha now that is so wicked cool the
bill<00:01:52.380> caught<00:01:52.710> on<00:01:52.890> fire<00:01:53.190> but<00:01:53.820> it<00:01:54.000> didn't<00:01:54.270> burn

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:54.300 
bill caught on fire but it didn't burn

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:58.810 
bill caught on fire but it didn't burn
it<00:01:54.450> up<00:01:54.630> so<00:01:55.350> why<00:01:56.100> doesn't<00:01:56.850> the<00:01:57.030> dollar<00:01:57.300> bill

00:01:58.810 --> 00:01:58.820 
it up so why doesn't the dollar bill

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:02.000 
it up so why doesn't the dollar bill
well<00:01:59.820> don't<00:02:00.480> look<00:02:00.630> at<00:02:00.810> me<00:02:00.870> there<00:02:01.590> you<00:02:01.650> go<00:02:01.800> close

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:02.010 
well don't look at me there you go close

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:05.960 
well don't look at me there you go close
up<00:02:02.220> look<00:02:02.460> okay<00:02:03.330> a<00:02:04.220> solution<00:02:05.220> is<00:02:05.340> a<00:02:05.370> mixture<00:02:05.820> of

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:05.970 
up look okay a solution is a mixture of

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:07.640 
up look okay a solution is a mixture of
two<00:02:06.300> or<00:02:06.450> more<00:02:06.479> substances<00:02:06.630> where<00:02:07.530> the

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:07.650 
two or more substances where the

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:09.260 
two or more substances where the
molecules<00:02:08.250> are<00:02:08.459> evenly<00:02:08.820> dispersed

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
molecules are evenly dispersed

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.270 
molecules are evenly dispersed
throughout<00:02:09.690> each<00:02:09.869> other<00:02:10.110> rubbing<00:02:10.649> alcohol<00:02:10.800> is

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
throughout each other rubbing alcohol is

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.770 
throughout each other rubbing alcohol is
a<00:02:11.310> liquid<00:02:11.760> dissolved<00:02:12.150> in<00:02:12.270> a<00:02:12.300> liquid<00:02:12.360> because

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
a liquid dissolved in a liquid because

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.110 
a liquid dissolved in a liquid because
the<00:02:13.050> alcohol<00:02:13.200> molecules<00:02:14.070> evenly<00:02:14.610> fill<00:02:14.850> in<00:02:15.000> the

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
the alcohol molecules evenly fill in the

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.820 
the alcohol molecules evenly fill in the
spaces<00:02:15.420> between<00:02:15.630> the<00:02:16.020> water<00:02:16.230> molecules

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
spaces between the water molecules

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:18.830 
spaces between the water molecules
solutions<00:02:17.730> are<00:02:17.910> different<00:02:18.240> from<00:02:18.390> colloids

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
solutions are different from colloids

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.630 
solutions are different from colloids
because<00:02:19.200> colloid<00:02:19.650> mixtures<00:02:20.190> are<00:02:20.400> just

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
because colloid mixtures are just

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.910 
because colloid mixtures are just
unevenly<00:02:21.270> trapped<00:02:21.720> pockets<00:02:22.230> and<00:02:22.350> molecules

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
unevenly trapped pockets and molecules

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.699 
unevenly trapped pockets and molecules
and<00:02:23.190> other<00:02:23.370> molecules<00:02:24.200> when<00:02:25.200> you<00:02:25.290> light<00:02:25.530> the

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
and other molecules when you light the

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:28.220 
and other molecules when you light the
alcohol<00:02:26.100> solution<00:02:26.760> soak<00:02:27.030> piece<00:02:27.300> of<00:02:27.450> paper<00:02:27.690> the

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
alcohol solution soak piece of paper the

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.740 
alcohol solution soak piece of paper the
alcohol<00:02:28.860> ignites<00:02:29.310> the<00:02:29.790> water<00:02:30.060> portion<00:02:30.450> of<00:02:30.690> the

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
alcohol ignites the water portion of the

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.080 
alcohol ignites the water portion of the
solution<00:02:31.260> doesn't<00:02:31.830> ignite<00:02:32.100> and<00:02:32.340> absorbs<00:02:32.790> most

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
solution doesn't ignite and absorbs most

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:34.850 
solution doesn't ignite and absorbs most
of<00:02:33.270> the<00:02:33.390> heat<00:02:33.660> energy<00:02:33.900> which<00:02:34.350> is<00:02:34.680> why<00:02:34.800> the

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
of the heat energy which is why the

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.100 
of the heat energy which is why the
paper<00:02:35.190> doesn't<00:02:35.580> burn<00:02:35.760> the<00:02:36.060> alcohol<00:02:36.600> burning

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
paper doesn't burn the alcohol burning

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:38.960 
paper doesn't burn the alcohol burning
away<00:02:37.380> leaving<00:02:37.770> just<00:02:37.980> the<00:02:38.130> bill<00:02:38.370> proves<00:02:38.850> that

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
away leaving just the bill proves that

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:40.850 
away leaving just the bill proves that
the<00:02:39.090> alcohol<00:02:39.630> was<00:02:39.840> dissolved<00:02:40.620> in<00:02:40.739> the<00:02:40.830> water

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
the alcohol was dissolved in the water

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.610 
the alcohol was dissolved in the water
of<00:02:41.370> course<00:02:41.880> if<00:02:42.150> the<00:02:42.270> heat<00:02:42.480> energy<00:02:42.690> vaporizes

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
of course if the heat energy vaporizes

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.470 
of course if the heat energy vaporizes
the<00:02:43.650> water<00:02:43.980> that<00:02:44.459> it<00:02:44.580> will<00:02:44.670> burn<00:02:44.940> up<00:02:45.120> the<00:02:45.239> paper

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
the water that it will burn up the paper

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.330 
the water that it will burn up the paper
which<00:02:46.020> is<00:02:46.050> why<00:02:46.290> you<00:02:46.350> should<00:02:46.620> use<00:02:46.650> regular

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
which is why you should use regular

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.270 
which is why you should use regular
paper<00:02:47.370> and<00:02:47.910> not<00:02:48.060> money<00:02:48.410> all<00:02:49.410> three<00:02:49.830> phases<00:02:50.070> of

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
paper and not money all three phases of

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.130 
paper and not money all three phases of
matter<00:02:50.550> can<00:02:50.910> be<00:02:50.940> a<00:02:51.060> solvent<00:02:51.690> or<00:02:51.810> something

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
matter can be a solvent or something

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.350 
matter can be a solvent or something
that<00:02:52.260> dissolves<00:02:52.950> other<00:02:53.100> matter<00:02:53.430> and<00:02:53.730> even<00:02:54.239> be

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
that dissolves other matter and even be

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.810 
that dissolves other matter and even be
dissolved<00:02:55.110> by<00:02:55.320> a<00:02:55.350> solvent<00:02:55.950> however<00:02:56.489> the<00:02:56.670> most

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:56.820 
dissolved by a solvent however the most

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:58.910 
dissolved by a solvent however the most
common<00:02:56.940> solvent<00:02:57.810> is<00:02:57.930> liquid<00:02:58.380> water<00:02:58.410> which

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
common solvent is liquid water which

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.640 
common solvent is liquid water which
dissolves<00:02:59.489> gases<00:03:00.239> liquids<00:03:00.480> and<00:03:00.900> solids<00:03:01.170> very

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
dissolves gases liquids and solids very

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:04.070 
dissolves gases liquids and solids very
well<00:03:01.950> solids<00:03:02.880> can<00:03:03.090> also<00:03:03.269> dissolve<00:03:03.750> the<00:03:03.900> three

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
well solids can also dissolve the three

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.470 
well solids can also dissolve the three
phases<00:03:04.320> of<00:03:04.500> matter<00:03:04.739> such<00:03:05.489> as<00:03:05.549> gases<00:03:06.239> being

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
$20 bill on fire and it doesn't burn is

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:34.670 
$20 bill on fire and it doesn't burn is
why<00:03:29.580> science<00:03:31.370> is<00:03:32.370> so<00:03:32.640> cool
