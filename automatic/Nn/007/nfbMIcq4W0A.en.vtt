don't like that's going to pick a point

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.830 
don't like that's going to pick a point
of<00:02:11.959> unseemly<00:02:12.959> bitchiness

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840

the<00:02:14.290> straps<00:02:15.129> are<00:02:15.129> supposed<00:02:15.580> to<00:02:15.670> hold<00:02:15.879> like

the straps are supposed to hold like

the straps are supposed to hold like
this<00:02:16.180> I<00:02:16.690> don't<00:02:16.870> know<00:02:16.930> if<00:02:16.989> you<00:02:17.080> can<00:02:17.200> see<00:02:17.650> that

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
this I don't know if you can see that

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:19.830 
this I don't know if you can see that
very<00:02:18.069> well<00:02:18.220> well<00:02:18.819> what<00:02:19.000> happens<00:02:19.360> is<00:02:19.540> they

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
very well well what happens is they

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.020 
very well well what happens is they
eventually<00:02:20.110> turn<00:02:20.500> like<00:02:20.769> this<00:02:21.010> and<00:02:21.310> so<00:02:21.819> you<00:02:21.910> get

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
eventually turn like this and so you get

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.229 
eventually turn like this and so you get
a<00:02:22.060> bunching<00:02:22.599> of<00:02:23.069> the<00:02:24.069> and<00:02:24.849> that's<00:02:25.060> that's

00:02:25.229 --> 00:02:25.239 
a bunching of the and that's that's

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:27.270 
a bunching of the and that's that's
really<00:02:25.599> small<00:02:25.870> potatoes<00:02:26.349> because<00:02:26.650> this<00:02:27.069> is

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
really small potatoes because this is

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.259 
really small potatoes because this is
nylon<00:02:28.209> I<00:02:28.269> think<00:02:29.489> but<00:02:30.489> I<00:02:30.730> would<00:02:30.910> have<00:02:31.000> liked<00:02:31.180> to

00:02:31.259 --> 00:02:31.269 
nylon I think but I would have liked to

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:34.050 
nylon I think but I would have liked to
see<00:02:31.540> some<00:02:31.900> sort<00:02:32.200> of<00:02:32.340> loop<00:02:33.340> system<00:02:33.730> to<00:02:33.849> prevent

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
see some sort of loop system to prevent

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:35.880 
see some sort of loop system to prevent
that<00:02:34.239> from<00:02:34.299> happening<00:02:34.530> other<00:02:35.530> than<00:02:35.680> that<00:02:35.739> I

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
that from happening other than that I

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:38.789 
that from happening other than that I
think<00:02:35.980> targets<00:02:36.519> did<00:02:36.670> a<00:02:36.700> pretty<00:02:36.940> good<00:02:37.120> job<00:02:37.799> the

00:02:38.789 --> 00:02:38.799 
think targets did a pretty good job the

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:41.970 
think targets did a pretty good job the

again<00:02:56.099> it's<00:02:57.099> kind<00:02:57.280> of<00:02:57.400> a<00:02:57.489> tractive<00:02:57.970> looking

00:02:58.229 --> 00:02:58.239 
again it's kind of a tractive looking

back it's got you know pretty decent
features<00:03:01.030> and<00:03:02.190> for<00:03:03.190> the<00:03:03.280> money<00:03:03.519> I<00:03:03.760> think<00:03:04.090> it's

00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:04.239 
features and for the money I think it's

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:07.650 
features and for the money I think it's
definitely<00:03:04.450> a<00:03:04.720> buy<00:03:04.900> and<00:03:05.280> it<00:03:06.280> carries<00:03:06.849> my<00:03:07.000> g73

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:07.660 
definitely a buy and it carries my g73

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:10.379 
definitely a buy and it carries my g73
