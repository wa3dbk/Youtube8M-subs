 Hello, I want to tell you for a long time 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:09.679
 my favorite company 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:12.179
 produces lights 

00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:19.470
 this is a phoenix farm 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:20.970
 and I want to talk to the model e21 means 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.160
 fenix e21 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:30.349
 goes here in such here in the firm 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:30.349
 the blister pack comes with it 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:35.850
 sealing 2 to pay 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.890
 o-rings and spare 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:41.570
 button pad 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:44.820
 also the well-known lanyard from the phoenix 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:49.920
 which is famous for its strings in 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:54.680
 really not very fat further in 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.680
 The bundle comes with a phoenix warranty and 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:07.690
 instruction in two languages ​​english and 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:11.290
 Chinese is not as extensive a fact on 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:15.340
 phoenix l to 10 on phoenix aldo here by 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:17.610
 in my four languages including 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:17.610
 Russian 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.320
 I will tell about technical characteristics 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:29.340
 this lantern 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:33.100
 its length is 161 millimeter 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:36.869
 diameter in the thickest thickest spot 26 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.869
 and in the main part 22 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:45.630
 it works on two type 2a batteries 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.630
 finger 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:55.869
 the reflector is smooth, it is made of 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:02:01.039
 aviation aluminum anodized 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:02:06.259
 third degree water protection ipx8 can 

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:09.820
 are friends up to two meters and shockproof 

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:09.820
 you can drop it a meter and a half 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:20.450
 let's see what's inside this 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:33.280
 lantern we analyze it versed on three 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:38.299
 parts so the head of the lantern 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:41.860
 All contact elements are gold plated 

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:41.860
 written phoenix 

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:51.190
 Further, the middle part did not like it 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:54.530
 see what's the thread here 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:57.440
 head portion and wall thickness here and 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:03:01.269
 measured four and a half millimeters 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:06.829
 they are very thick 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:10.030
 here is also such a good carving here 

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:10.030
 two and a half millimeters 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:15.640
 By the way the flashlight from the box is not at all 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:21.630
 smeared 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:21.630
 dry thread in general but it is fixable and 

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:29.640
 the back is also needed to gilded 

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:41.880
 next let's collect 

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:44.740
 but for now I’m going to talk about light waves 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:46.620
 characteristics means it has two 

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:51.040
 operating mode 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:58.390
 This is the usual mode and the camp sites in the usual 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:04:04.680
 mode it produces 48 lumens and so 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:09.360
 can work 11 hours on 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:10.960
 cs2 batteries splines 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:14.250
 ampere hours 

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:18.060
 milliamper hours he also has 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:24.310
 second mode and here's a turnaround switch 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:29.490
 heads counterclockwise and here it is 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:32.490
 produces 150 lumens and it can work 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:32.490
 2:15 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:46.590
 on the table it does not show how it shines 

00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:50.849
 on the street so see you on the street and so 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:52.800
 test on the street I took it for fun 

00:04:50.849 --> 00:04:57.569
 your l to 10 what is for yourself 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:05:08.789
 compare how it will shine on the background of e 

00:04:57.569 --> 00:05:14.389
 21 and so e 2148 lumens is enough 

00:05:08.789 --> 00:05:16.770
 shines well let's switch to turbo mode 

00:05:14.389 --> 00:05:20.129
 now more or less 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:29.340
 here you can enlighten the front 

00:05:20.129 --> 00:05:35.129
 the building she meters so 50 he's still there 

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:41.120
 is such cubby now I 

00:05:35.129 --> 00:05:46.879
 I'll try to put 45 lumens on my 

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:51.900
 l to 10 and 45 on 

00:05:46.879 --> 00:05:56.510
 E21 but up to 10 Spector such 

00:05:51.900 --> 00:06:03.580
 pretty wide she's narrow 

00:05:56.510 --> 00:06:11.870
 here is the building in turbo mode 100 lumen 

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:12.590
 against 150 lumens and so here are 100 lumens on 

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:21.590
 the building 

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:22.220
 let me turn on the building and 150 too 

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:25.220
 we know 

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:30.470
 visible but with 

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:33.320
 one moment ld 10 work only 1 1 

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:42.260
 batteries a le 

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:45.650
 21 uses two but incidentally e l d l 

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:47.390
 10 I like more since he 

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:50.120
 only works on one battery he 

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:54.080
 much better suited for and disi 

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:59.450
 he has more modes of operation 

00:06:54.080 --> 00:07:00.530
 what is it 0 5 ye 21 units 21 for such 

00:06:59.450 --> 00:07:05.690
 domestic needs 

00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:08.180
 Needs everything is fine hope my 

00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:10.990
 video was helpful thanks for watching 

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:10.990
 see you bye
