hey<00:00:04.760> I'm<00:00:04.910> Denny<00:00:05.150> from<00:00:05.330> Manitou<00:00:05.840> I'm<00:00:06.050> here<00:00:06.260> at

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:06.350 
hey I'm Denny from Manitou I'm here at

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:08.350 
hey I'm Denny from Manitou I'm here at
sea<00:00:06.529> otter<00:00:06.770> with<00:00:06.920> M<00:00:07.040> TBR<00:00:07.520> and<00:00:07.759> I've<00:00:08.180> got<00:00:08.330> a

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:08.360 
sea otter with M TBR and I've got a

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:11.350 
sea otter with M TBR and I've got a
model<00:00:08.900> year<00:00:09.139> 10<00:00:09.440> Manitou<00:00:10.190> are<00:00:10.370> seven<00:00:10.850> here<00:00:11.059> and

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:11.360 
model year 10 Manitou are seven here and

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:13.779 
model year 10 Manitou are seven here and
with<00:00:11.900> new<00:00:12.049> for<00:00:12.200> 2010<00:00:12.889> is<00:00:12.920> we<00:00:13.190> have<00:00:13.340> a<00:00:13.369> new

00:00:13.779 --> 00:00:13.789 
with new for 2010 is we have a new

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:16.390 
with new for 2010 is we have a new
damper<00:00:14.240> called<00:00:14.420> absolute<00:00:14.990> plus<00:00:15.289> it's<00:00:16.160> got

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:16.400 
damper called absolute plus it's got

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.550 
damper called absolute plus it's got
independent<00:00:17.060> eye<00:00:17.150> and<00:00:17.539> low-speed<00:00:18.080> damping

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:18.560 
independent eye and low-speed damping

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.590 
independent eye and low-speed damping
low-speed<00:00:19.520> damper<00:00:19.820> is<00:00:19.910> called<00:00:20.150> speed<00:00:20.450> knee

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:20.600 
low-speed damper is called speed knee

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.900 
low-speed damper is called speed knee
and<00:00:21.110> it's<00:00:21.470> a<00:00:21.620> needle<00:00:22.040> base<00:00:22.220> damper<00:00:22.700> I've

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:22.910 
and it's a needle base damper I've

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:24.750 
and it's a needle base damper I've
actually<00:00:23.090> got<00:00:23.360> one<00:00:23.390> right<00:00:23.660> here

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:24.760 
actually got one right here

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:27.160 
actually got one right here
so<00:00:25.760> the<00:00:25.880> low-speed<00:00:26.210> damper<00:00:26.570> is<00:00:26.660> externally

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:27.170 
so the low-speed damper is externally

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:30.160 
so the low-speed damper is externally
adjustable<00:00:27.800> in<00:00:28.550> the<00:00:28.610> closed<00:00:29.450> position

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:30.170 
adjustable in the closed position

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:32.529 
adjustable in the closed position
it's<00:00:30.770> the<00:00:31.280> fork<00:00:31.460> is<00:00:31.580> effectively<00:00:31.970> locked<00:00:32.270> out

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:32.539 
it's the fork is effectively locked out

00:00:32.539 --> 00:00:34.869 
it's the fork is effectively locked out
except<00:00:33.230> for<00:00:33.350> the<00:00:33.410> high<00:00:33.530> speed<00:00:33.800> damper<00:00:34.190> and<00:00:34.340> in

00:00:34.869 --> 00:00:34.879 
except for the high speed damper and in

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:38.470 
except for the high speed damper and in
the<00:00:34.969> open<00:00:35.239> position<00:00:35.440> it's<00:00:36.440> open<00:00:36.739> the<00:00:37.609> needle

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:38.480 
the open position it's open the needle

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.040 
the open position it's open the needle
itself<00:00:40.059> looks<00:00:41.059> like<00:00:41.120> this<00:00:41.239> tapered<00:00:42.019> needle

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:42.050 
itself looks like this tapered needle

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:43.750 
itself looks like this tapered needle
that<00:00:42.319> moves<00:00:42.589> up<00:00:42.769> and<00:00:42.920> down<00:00:43.010> into<00:00:43.429> an<00:00:43.519> orifice

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:43.760 
that moves up and down into an orifice

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:48.399 
that moves up and down into an orifice
and<00:00:44.089> as<00:00:44.210> you<00:00:44.739> thread<00:00:45.739> the<00:00:45.890> needle<00:00:46.159> in<00:00:46.309> it<00:00:47.409> makes

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:48.409 
and as you thread the needle in it makes

00:00:48.409 --> 00:00:51.099 
and as you thread the needle in it makes
that<00:00:48.530> orifice<00:00:48.949> smaller<00:00:49.539> the<00:00:50.539> high<00:00:50.809> speed

00:00:51.099 --> 00:00:51.109 
that orifice smaller the high speed

00:00:51.109 --> 00:00:53.919 
that orifice smaller the high speed
damper<00:00:51.530> is<00:00:51.710> like<00:00:52.370> a<00:00:52.399> lot<00:00:52.789> like<00:00:52.940> a<00:00:52.969> TPC<00:00:53.539> damper

00:00:53.919 --> 00:00:53.929 
damper is like a lot like a TPC damper

00:00:53.929 --> 00:00:56.919 
damper is like a lot like a TPC damper
it's<00:00:54.079> shim<00:00:54.319> based<00:00:55.149> is<00:00:56.149> the<00:00:56.420> this<00:00:56.569> is<00:00:56.629> the<00:00:56.719> shim

00:00:56.919 --> 00:00:56.929 
it's shim based is the this is the shim

00:00:56.929 --> 00:00:58.719 
it's shim based is the this is the shim
stack<00:00:57.170> here<00:00:57.530> and<00:00:57.859> these<00:00:58.190> are<00:00:58.249> the<00:00:58.370> ports

00:00:58.719 --> 00:00:58.729 
stack here and these are the ports

00:00:58.729 --> 00:01:01.059 
stack here and these are the ports
through<00:00:58.940> which<00:00:59.059> the<00:00:59.210> oil<00:00:59.389> passes<00:00:59.929> so<00:01:00.649> unless

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:01.069 
through which the oil passes so unless

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:02.829 
through which the oil passes so unless
the<00:01:01.339> the<00:01:01.639> speed<00:01:01.879> needle<00:01:02.179> is<00:01:02.269> totally<00:01:02.629> closed

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:02.839 
the the speed needle is totally closed

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:04.299 
the the speed needle is totally closed
you've<00:01:03.049> always<00:01:03.170> got<00:01:03.379> oil<00:01:03.620> moving<00:01:04.010> through<00:01:04.220> the

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:04.309 
you've always got oil moving through the

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:06.700 
you've always got oil moving through the
lowest<00:01:04.640> speed<00:01:04.790> damper<00:01:05.239> but<00:01:05.390> the<00:01:06.170> the<00:01:06.590> high

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:06.710 
lowest speed damper but the the high

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:08.560 
lowest speed damper but the the high
speed<00:01:07.010> dampers<00:01:07.400> engaged<00:01:07.730> on<00:01:07.970> a<00:01:08.000> sort<00:01:08.360> of<00:01:08.420> a
