or backwards if you're overweight on

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.480 
or backwards if you're overweight on
your<00:01:35.190> drives<00:01:35.640> and<00:01:36.560> you're<00:01:37.560> don't<00:01:37.950> have<00:01:38.190> enough

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490

weight<00:01:38.760> on<00:01:39.030> the<00:01:39.360> steer<00:01:39.720> you<00:01:39.960> can<00:01:40.170> actually

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:40.580 
weight on the steer you can actually

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:44.780 
weight on the steer you can actually
move<00:01:41.580> this<00:01:41.970> for<00:01:42.300> about<00:01:42.570> a<00:01:42.600> half<00:01:42.990> a<00:01:43.230> foot<00:01:43.260> and<00:01:43.920> I

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
move this for about a half a foot and I

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.970 
move this for about a half a foot and I
believe<00:01:45.150> it<00:01:45.270> or<00:01:45.390> not<00:01:45.510> it<00:01:45.870> will<00:01:46.080> make<00:01:46.440> a<00:01:46.470> big

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:46.980 
believe it or not it will make a big

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:52.050 
believe it or not it will make a big
difference<00:01:47.030> on<00:01:48.770> shifting<00:01:49.770> the<00:01:49.980> way

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:52.060 
difference on shifting the way

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.499 
difference on shifting the way
but<00:01:53.060> most<00:01:53.360> of<00:01:53.570> the<00:01:53.719> time<00:01:53.950> 90%<00:01:54.950> we<00:01:55.520> don't<00:01:55.789> move

00:01:56.499 --> 00:01:56.509 
but most of the time 90% we don't move

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:01.899 
but most of the time 90% we don't move
up<00:01:57.460> but<00:01:58.460> I<00:01:59.890> can't<00:02:00.890> move<00:02:01.100> them<00:02:01.280> because<00:02:01.640> mine

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:01.909 
up but I can't move them because mine

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:08.240 
up but I can't move them because mine
has<00:02:01.939> permanently<00:02:02.810> fixed

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.200 

it's<00:02:08.880> a<00:02:09.000> beautiful<00:02:09.540> truck<00:02:10.520> I've<00:02:11.520> never<00:02:11.850> seen
