00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
baskets that's when my nurse kind of

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:40.059 
baskets that's when my nurse kind of
start<00:02:37.519> to<00:02:37.579> chill<00:02:37.849> down<00:02:37.879> and<00:02:38.390> then<00:02:38.989> like<00:02:39.680> right

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:40.069 
start to chill down and then like right

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:43.960

before<00:02:40.549> step<00:02:41.120> like<00:02:41.629> Oh<00:02:42.430> set<00:02:43.430> first<00:02:43.730> time

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970 
before step like Oh set first time

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:45.490 
before step like Oh set first time
that's<00:02:44.180> when<00:02:44.359> like<00:02:44.510> my<00:02:44.659> nerves<00:02:44.870> like<00:02:45.139> start

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
that's when like my nerves like start

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.819 
that's when like my nerves like start
but<00:02:45.950> the<00:02:46.040> most<00:02:46.220> nerves<00:02:46.579> is<00:02:46.879> like<00:02:47.680> when<00:02:48.680> you're

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:48.829 
but the most nerves is like when you're

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:50.680 
but the most nerves is like when you're
waiting<00:02:48.980> for<00:02:49.099> the<00:02:49.220> music<00:02:49.489> to<00:02:49.609> turn<00:02:49.760> on<00:02:49.909> and<00:02:50.450> I

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:50.690 
waiting for the music to turn on and I

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:51.879 
waiting for the music to turn on and I
think<00:02:50.930> it's<00:02:51.049> pretty<00:02:51.260> normal<00:02:51.470> when<00:02:51.709> you're

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:51.889 
think it's pretty normal when you're

00:02:51.889 --> 00:02:53.229 
think it's pretty normal when you're
scared<00:02:52.129> so<00:02:52.400> I<00:02:52.430> guess<00:02:52.790> the<00:02:52.939> answer<00:02:52.970> your

00:02:53.229 --> 00:02:53.239 
scared so I guess the answer your
