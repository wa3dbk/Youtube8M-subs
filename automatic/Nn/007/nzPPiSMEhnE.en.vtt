00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:35.750 
especially when I grew up that we didn't

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:38.380 
especially when I grew up that we didn't
have<00:00:35.840> strong<00:00:36.020> teams<00:00:36.410> so<00:00:36.740> I<00:00:37.400> just<00:00:38.090> wanted<00:00:38.300> to

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:38.390

win<00:00:41.510> as<00:00:41.660> I<00:00:41.750> could<00:00:41.960> and<00:00:42.200> when<00:00:42.770> we<00:00:42.890> weren't<00:00:43.039> so

00:00:43.209 --> 00:00:43.219

I<00:00:47.620> mean<00:00:48.620> I<00:00:48.680> guess<00:00:48.980> you<00:00:49.070> start<00:00:49.280> from<00:00:49.430> the<00:00:49.550> start

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:49.850 
I mean I guess you start from the start

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:52.330 
I mean I guess you start from the start
obviously<00:00:50.239> my<00:00:51.079> dad<00:00:51.289> will<00:00:51.559> see<00:00:51.739> was<00:00:51.859> my<00:00:51.980> only

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:52.340 
obviously my dad will see was my only

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:56.020 
obviously my dad will see was my only
goalie<00:00:52.640> coach<00:00:52.879> until<00:00:53.270> I<00:00:53.300> was<00:00:54.430> 16<00:00:55.430> they<00:00:55.789> think

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:56.030 
goalie coach until I was 16 they think

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.400 
goalie coach until I was 16 they think
but<00:00:56.980> I've<00:00:57.980> always<00:00:58.250> been<00:00:58.370> a<00:00:58.430> visual<00:00:58.850> learner<00:00:59.410> if

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:00.410 
but I've always been a visual learner if

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:02.819 
but I've always been a visual learner if
I<00:01:00.500> see<00:01:00.710> something<00:01:00.980> I<00:01:01.190> can<00:01:01.340> usually<00:01:01.460> do<00:01:01.760> it

a lot from those guys that's that was my

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:27.370 
a lot from those guys that's that was my
form<00:01:23.479> of<00:01:23.689> teaching<00:01:24.470> and<00:01:24.890> then<00:01:26.200> my<00:01:27.200> dad

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:43.720 
to see how far I can push my limits a

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:46.229 
to see how far I can push my limits a
focus<00:03:44.530> of<00:03:44.769> working<00:03:45.250> all<00:03:45.549> that<00:03:45.760> that's<00:03:45.910> no<00:03:46.090> way

00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:46.239

definitely as it's times where it's a
hard<00:03:59.560> it's<00:04:00.280> it's<00:04:01.260> there's<00:04:02.260> a<00:04:02.290> lot<00:04:02.350> of<00:04:02.530> pressure

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.840 
having fun with it the worst thing I see
now<00:04:22.210> is<00:04:22.449> when<00:04:22.630> the<00:04:25.139> young<00:04:26.139> goalies<00:04:26.620> I<00:04:27.280> think

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:27.850 
now is when the young goalies I think

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:30.360 
now is when the young goalies I think
you<00:04:28.780> try<00:04:29.050> and<00:04:29.169> get<00:04:29.320> to<00:04:29.470> the<00:04:29.650> highest<00:04:29.889> level<00:04:30.340> of

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:30.370 
you try and get to the highest level of

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:33.150 
you try and get to the highest level of
competition<00:04:30.850> all<00:04:31.180> the<00:04:31.270> time<00:04:31.480> I<00:04:31.720> think<00:04:32.160> that's

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:33.160 
competition all the time I think that's

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:34.770 
competition all the time I think that's
almost<00:04:33.340> the<00:04:33.580> wrong<00:04:33.729> thing<00:04:34.000> to<00:04:34.120> do<00:04:34.270> I<00:04:34.330> think<00:04:34.479> you

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:34.780 
almost the wrong thing to do I think you

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:37.260 
almost the wrong thing to do I think you
just<00:04:34.930> want<00:04:35.199> to<00:04:35.260> be<00:04:35.800> in<00:04:35.919> a<00:04:36.010> chance<00:04:36.310> to<00:04:36.580> play<00:04:37.000> a

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:37.270 
just want to be in a chance to play a

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:40.080 
just want to be in a chance to play a
lot<00:04:37.710> wherever<00:04:38.710> you<00:04:38.860> can<00:04:38.979> play<00:04:39.220> I<00:04:39.250> think<00:04:39.850> that's

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:40.090 
lot wherever you can play I think that's

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:43.320 
lot wherever you can play I think that's
a<00:04:40.620> lot<00:04:41.620> of<00:04:41.650> kids<00:04:42.160> get<00:04:42.400> discouraged<00:04:43.060> if<00:04:43.180> they

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:43.330 
a lot of kids get discouraged if they

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:44.969 
a lot of kids get discouraged if they
get<00:04:43.479> cut<00:04:43.690> from<00:04:43.870> the<00:04:43.960> triple-a<00:04:44.680> or<00:04:44.860> the

00:04:44.969 --> 00:04:44.979 
get cut from the triple-a or the

00:04:44.979 --> 00:04:46.670 
get cut from the triple-a or the
double-a<00:04:45.370> team

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:46.680 
double-a team

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:48.870 
double-a team
honestly<00:04:47.680> I<00:04:47.740> don't<00:04:47.860> think<00:04:48.040> it<00:04:48.280> matters<00:04:48.460> what

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:48.880 
honestly I don't think it matters what

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:50.670 
honestly I don't think it matters what
what<00:04:49.300> level<00:04:49.600> you<00:04:49.750> play<00:04:49.900> at<00:04:50.110> as<00:04:50.290> long<00:04:50.440> as<00:04:50.590> you

what level you play at as long as you

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:52.920
