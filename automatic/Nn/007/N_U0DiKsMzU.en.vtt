00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:05.790
 i 

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:14.220
 this Saturday at 1345 because it is measured at 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.139
 swansea of course and with all the 

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:18.600
 favoritism of the world after seeing the 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.400
 swansea plus the che team to stop 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.110
 also the initiative good opening 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.560
 now for there very long the game to 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:27.230
 united the center of jaume i the collegiate 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.570
 I called it a penalty I can believe it 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:33.960
 penalty awarded the referee 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:36.420
 party I think there's contact but 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.590
 wayne rooney sees that the ball stays 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:42.040
 far back 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:43.960
 but it's not a penalty that we 'll never see 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:45.670
 this repetition in contact is minimal and 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:48.640
 Wayne Rooney hits a jump there is as there 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:50.910
 three is going to hit the ball from the 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.910
 eleven meters 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:53.850
 There is mud 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:03.890
 to diego alves this dear javi pÃ©rez is 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:06.590
 a scandal there was a good chance 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:07.520
 to give him to stop and let's see 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:09.020
 here 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:12.200
 this is the good one for your success with the 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:13.370
 ball I think no no no no touches no 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.990
 great player who has been able to occupy 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:18.110
 perfectly the right side as the 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:20.570
 more forward position of the lane 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:22.250
 and therefore good with polyvalent 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:24.470
 no doubt Antonio Barragan ball 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:28.250
 loose in the eye area to fletcher and the 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:31.640
 goal has scored the united 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:33.370
 in a loose ball on the front of the 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:36.100
 area 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:39.550
 to hit already we are going to see the sequence 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:41.410
 there is in fact not even the 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:44.650
 clearance not because the entire player of the 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:46.450
 united the good clearance is that there is so much 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:49.930
 people within the area that at last and 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:52.360
 out if it was a very real possibility that 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:55.720
 all in someone made impossible 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:57.470
 stretched by diego alves the half hour of 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:00.470
 this second period 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:02.000
 rodrigo de paul near the ball and 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:05.990
 also his compatriot pablo piatti 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.800
 let's see who hangs will be yacht with 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:10.940
 the left and is 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.940
 the value rejects 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.459
 d 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:29.430
 with Valencia takes advantage s 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:33.240
 Prolonged ball in defense for a 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:35.790
 manchester united player of turn 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:40.110
 it is an extension is a bad clearance 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:44.070
 clearance to shoot and put in the 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:46.980
 squad a ball that ends in the 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:49.340
 back of the net and representing the consolation goal 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:53.490
 draw of valencia and rodrigo 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:55.020
 rest during the week during almost all 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:56.970
 the sectional season cup day 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:03:00.040
 the risk of being good eye to fellaini 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:02.110
 that will score the winning goal 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:05.319
 of Manchester United in the last 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:07.840
 I sigh I do not know if they were claiming 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:09.489
 some fault I am the last play 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:14.650
 yes a little weird the action we will see 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:18.879
 the center is certainly normal if I 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:21.040
 I do not know if there is missing on Diego Alves 

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:23.140
 maybe if there is a lack because fellaini does not 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.819
 touches alves but touches the defender who 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:26.260
 ended up hitting diego alves that 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:29.670
 I think that too and I think it's missing 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.670
 hand angels valencia
