back and adjustable straps okay now

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:36.150 
back and adjustable straps okay now
because<00:00:34.480> of<00:00:34.810> that<00:00:34.960> is<00:00:35.170> you<00:00:35.320> see<00:00:35.500> that's<00:00:35.650> the

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:36.160 
because of that is you see that's the

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.360 
because of that is you see that's the
part<00:00:36.489> that<00:00:36.520> I<00:00:36.700> wait<00:00:37.290> it's<00:00:38.290> lace<00:00:38.680> comes<00:00:39.040> all<00:00:39.250> the

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:39.370 
part that I wait it's lace comes all the

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:41.250 
part that I wait it's lace comes all the
way<00:00:39.400> back<00:00:39.550> to<00:00:39.940> here<00:00:40.270> and<00:00:40.420> then<00:00:40.570> it<00:00:40.600> has<00:00:40.750> that

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:41.260 
way back to here and then it has that

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:46.860 
way back to here and then it has that
but<00:00:42.010> it<00:00:42.430> does<00:00:42.700> allow<00:00:42.879> for<00:00:45.420> it<00:00:46.420> to<00:00:46.629> look<00:00:46.840> very

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:46.870 
but it does allow for it to look very

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:49.979 
but it does allow for it to look very
natural<00:00:47.170> when<00:00:47.920> you<00:00:48.010> look<00:00:48.220> through<00:00:48.610> it<00:00:48.940> I<00:00:49.239> don't

00:00:49.979 --> 00:00:49.989 
natural when you look through it I don't

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:52.619 
natural when you look through it I don't
know<00:00:50.080> if<00:00:50.170> you<00:00:50.260> can<00:00:50.410> see<00:00:50.739> it<00:00:51.010> how<00:00:51.309> I<00:00:51.370> see<00:00:51.790> it<00:00:51.820> but

00:00:52.619 --> 00:00:52.629 
know if you can see it how I see it but

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:54.770 
know if you can see it how I see it but
it<00:00:53.559> allows<00:00:53.949> it<00:00:54.190> to<00:00:54.220> look<00:00:54.460> very<00:00:54.489> natural

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
it allows it to look very natural

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:00.330 
it allows it to look very natural
because<00:00:56.070> of<00:00:57.070> the<00:00:57.840> wording<00:00:58.840> so<00:00:59.200> I<00:00:59.530> haven't

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:00.340 
because of the wording so I haven't

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:03.240 
because of the wording so I haven't
tried<00:01:00.550> to<00:01:00.579> sent<00:01:01.000> a<00:01:01.090> party<00:01:01.510> but<00:01:01.750> I<00:01:01.780> imagine<00:01:02.350> you

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:06.850 
might be able to dozens of possibilities

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:09.090 
might be able to dozens of possibilities
