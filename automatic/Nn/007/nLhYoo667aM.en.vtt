00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
your power to keep them at bay it's a

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:15.860 
your power to keep them at bay it's a
stalemate<00:00:14.670> and<00:00:15.030> it's<00:00:15.240> not<00:00:15.420> a<00:00:15.450> good<00:00:15.719> one

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
stalemate and it's not a good one

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.840 
stalemate and it's not a good one
because<00:00:15.929> you're<00:00:16.170> losing<00:00:16.350> tickets<00:00:16.859> fast<00:00:17.100> so<00:00:17.820> I

because you're losing tickets fast so I

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.730 
because you're losing tickets fast so I
usually<00:00:18.330> make<00:00:18.480> my<00:00:18.660> approach<00:00:19.020> by<00:00:19.260> starting<00:00:19.680> to

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
usually make my approach by starting to

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.609 
usually make my approach by starting to
clear<00:00:20.070> out<00:00:20.189> various<00:00:20.580> areas<00:00:21.020> including<00:00:22.020> the

by running engineer and keeping their

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.730 
by running engineer and keeping their
armor<00:01:20.340> at<00:01:20.520> bay<00:01:20.790> as<00:01:20.970> well<00:01:21.210> one<00:01:21.990> tank<00:01:22.320> is<00:01:22.530> not

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.770 
armor at bay as well one tank is not
enough<00:01:23.100> because<00:01:23.670> at<00:01:24.030> the<00:01:24.119> end<00:01:24.150> of<00:01:24.360> day<00:01:24.509> he's

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
enough because at the end of day he's

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
angles look at this other bridge once I

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:49.010 
angles look at this other bridge once I
clear<00:01:46.380> this<00:01:46.619> off<00:01:46.829> my<00:01:47.130> main<00:01:47.610> focus<00:01:48.450> is<00:01:48.810> this

flag holder for flag hold this is your
lane<00:04:22.310> take<00:04:23.310> one<00:04:23.490> of<00:04:23.550> these<00:04:23.639> bridges<00:04:23.940> probably

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:24.570 
lane take one of these bridges probably

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:26.160 
lane take one of these bridges probably
not<00:04:24.750> the<00:04:24.930> middle<00:04:25.229> bridge<00:04:25.409> that's<00:04:25.770> a<00:04:25.830> little

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:26.170 
not the middle bridge that's a little

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:27.660 
not the middle bridge that's a little
because<00:04:26.620> then<00:04:26.770> guys<00:04:26.980> can<00:04:27.160> get<00:04:27.250> to<00:04:27.400> run<00:04:27.520> this

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:27.670 
because then guys can get to run this

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:30.030 
because then guys can get to run this
lane<00:04:27.940> that's<00:04:28.570> bad<00:04:28.810> they<00:04:29.470> can<00:04:29.590> get<00:04:29.650> thrown<00:04:29.950> the

lane that's bad they can get thrown the
far<00:04:30.280> right<00:04:30.550> length<00:04:30.790> so<00:04:30.940> you've<00:04:31.060> got<00:04:31.210> to

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:31.450 
far right length so you've got to

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:33.090 
far right length so you've got to
measure<00:04:31.750> angles<00:04:32.320> like<00:04:32.350> you<00:04:32.590> really<00:04:32.860> can't

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:33.100 
measure angles like you really can't
