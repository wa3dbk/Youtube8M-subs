00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.160
 To the game if the yes from everyone crowded up lawn Shogi candidate last time the rule only mouth 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:11.490
 I explained the rule that I can do it 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:13.400
 However 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:18.170
 Is that okay? 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:20.580
 It's fun just because you do n't know or do something outside 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:24.600
 Maybe that's it 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:32.130
 How can I get lost from people who already know a little ? 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:38.790
 It is more fun if you enjoy it as a way of enjoying it 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:40.540
 I think that I would like to tell you more about the rules ahead of time 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:47.110
 The Tteyuu funeral 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:51.880
 It is important to make sure that you do not take yourself like you 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:54.620
 It there is also full What do a valid how to move do not know what to still toward the 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:59.050
 Also I'd say even if nothing therefore to glue 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:01:03.579
 In order to take the king or not to take his own village 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:06.640
 Then how about what should be considered in various ways 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:08.830
 One is to get a piece 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:13.340
 Hosoku' of I mean is 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:15.990
 It means that you take the other's piece 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:21.720
 For example, if you are here 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:28.350
 Yes, the wind was my own and the other two were my fugue 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:29.880
 Nde with which I make filco lip is obtained only one Ippu when such Fu in frame 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.000
 We will save 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:35.440
 It is a time of honor 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:41.800
 I'm going to open a piece 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:45.670
 At the end of the other party Ozawa , when it comes to the state that the adaptation becomes safer , one March 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:50.960
 Are you have been in but I became in doing this 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:54.290
 I mean Tsu not move only one by almost one step, such fat is to say to become their own fu guard 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:58.369
 Originally low value pieces are equal in this way 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:02:00.730
 We will make a reward by saying that the same moving people will come out 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:03.630
 + Say 

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:06.020
 I want to become accustomed like this 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:10.490
 Let me make this sound 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:14.569
 If you are doing something like this 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:18.129
 Going to Yuri to chase down chrysanthemum 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:18.129
 That is one way of thinking 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:28.220
 Say whether anything good if exceptional is the I frame obtained Actually, I'm not even so 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:31.650
 I'm game losing they've taken their own king even if ultimately no matter how thin 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:38.220
 As only one way of thinking 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:39.780
 If it says in the middle and the end of the end of the province and the end attached to the garden late 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.050
 Long time to go inside 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:45.920
 So there is also a maxim times or something 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:52.500
 In other words, it is all about whether the king is taken or taken 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:58.710
 Since the frame between the beginning and the middle is one less likely to be another reversal If you wait too long and full Tokushi 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:03:04.170
 That is to say that the idea that the early and middle stages aim at Komatori is also one way of thinking 

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:06.120
 If you know only the more words if there quite is quite saying Toka those things I Shogi 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:09.180
 It becomes quite easy to see 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:14.390
 I'm getting stronger 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:14.390
 The final stage is faster than the loss of the piece
