00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:03.860
 now 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.030
 note 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:22.640
 is that to people as they are I hope that 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:24.810
 are very good this time we bring 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:26.699
 a new video 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:31.020
 and it's just to talk about a 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:32.850
 game without moving a pot four if you 

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:35.070
 they will ask what is different about this 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.079
 video with all the other videos ok that 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.530
 in this move like four we have this 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:44.010
 game that is supported and optimized 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:46.500
 for 512 ram cell phones if it works 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.269
 pretty fluid with only 512 of ram 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.460
 another thing is that we no longer have to 

00:00:48.269 --> 00:00:53.040
 search the data we will download it 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.990
 directly by wifi or stop leaving 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:57.970
 the link in the description of the video 

00:00:55.990 --> 00:01:01.150
 among other reasons and is that also 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:03.250
 along with this I will upload him 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:06.120
 the video of how to optimize it for 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:08.770
 hand devices of 512 mb of ram 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:11.320
 how can we optimize it to run 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:13.660
 well if you have 500 to use it but you have 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:15.670
 a processor a bit short as well 

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:17.530
 let's show how we can make it 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:19.150
 so that it's pretty pretty fluid 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:21.880
 and what are we going to do the test and what 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:24.340
 we have installed this same side of 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:27.250
 android and we are going to open it so that they see 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:29.140
 which is downloaded by wifi 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.330
 and then as soon as it's ready we 're going to 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:34.660
 upload the configuration for those who 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:37.150
 they have low-end devices for 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:39.460
 who can download it here we are 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:41.740
 verifying the files that it requires 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:43.869
 thousand 162 megabytes let's scale their 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.760
 place let's put that yes as you 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:47.680
 come here you are downloading via wifi 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:49.660
 people really is a great game 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:52.450
 downloaded by wifi so there are no problems 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:55.720
 of incompatibility data to 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:57.460
 run 512 mb ram devices without 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:59.050
 no problem and we are going to upload the 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:01.830
 configuration for how to run the 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:03.610
 devices less than 512 mb 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:05.649
 gigabytes of ram 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:08.110
 if this is all people I hope that you 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:11.100
 like it and enjoy it and see you 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:11.100
 for the next
