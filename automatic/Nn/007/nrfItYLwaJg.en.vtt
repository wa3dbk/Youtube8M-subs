 polozkov job growth associated with 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:58.940
 low connection speed with 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:00.870
 Internet and it is not a very large quota 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.670

 read them on such a convenient Kiev display 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:26.200
 the application works faster than its 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.130
 analogues including for example the same 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.170
 official customer here is the latest nokia 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.950
 years running slower he's not 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:36.000
 freedom in my opinion 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.610
 unfortunately the client is in English 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:39.930
 nothing else will prevent you 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.120
 enjoy because here everything is very 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:42.969
 simply 

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:45.270
 the same features that were in 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.909
 twitter like there xoom mention you 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.230
 messages 

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:50.970
 and there status from 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.780
 search all this is exactly the same as in twitter 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.900
 nothing has changed i don't think that you have 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:57.150
 will cause some problems 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:58.030
 of use 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:00.100
 this application even in English 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:01.790
 if you don't know English very well 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:03.619
 it is good to start the publication of the main screen 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:06.930
 we see now therefore I will not go to the hill 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.589
 move on to mention 

00:02:08.589 --> 00:02:10.239
 so here is one of the things that I am pretty 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:11.999
 heavily occupied was the network you do not even 

00:02:11.999 --> 00:02:13.529
 only sections 

00:02:13.529 --> 00:02:15.869
 3 but this is just sides Arbat 

00:02:15.869 --> 00:02:18.119
 uploaded so let's move on to one 

00:02:18.119 --> 00:02:19.929
 specific here for example these are mine 

00:02:19.929 --> 00:02:22.459
 mentions how people responded to my 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:25.729
 message so on here baku 

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:27.649
 some kind of tablet pc tablet 

00:02:27.649 --> 00:02:30.069
 Viktor Kolotov Lexmark famous blogger 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:31.040
 hid 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.630
 here is a kambur that is famous in 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.280
 vlog which is laying 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.040

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:42.559
 also writes 

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:44.759
 so here is the mention of the premiere of matches 

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:45.939
 Russia 

00:02:45.939 --> 00:02:49.430
 Nokia rub twitter here they write to me that to me 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:52.179

00:02:57.739 --> 00:02:59.579
 WOV and assembly 

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:01.650
 well then let's go uv personal 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:03.829
 messages at the trial do not know what I have there 

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:05.370
 maybe i sweat 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.159
 but the hotel itself can take it or 

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:09.420
 censored because I do not know what is not written in 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:10.509
 private messages 

00:03:10.509 --> 00:03:13.359
 Qatar Disney studio director gave John 

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:15.299
 tons inventor 

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:16.989
 very interesting comrades 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:20.229
 talked to him on the screen 

00:03:20.229 --> 00:03:23.229
 so the messages from them have already been a year 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:26.609
 status and this is a special window for 

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:28.049
 to lay out in it 

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:29.889
 matched twitter 

00:03:29.889 --> 00:03:32.889
 now connect to Russian 

00:03:33.899 --> 00:03:36.899
 resolved 

00:03:38.839 --> 00:03:41.839
 men 

00:03:50.679 --> 00:03:53.469
 yes how is it not stopped by its 

00:03:53.469 --> 00:03:55.499
 there is also quite comfortable 

00:03:55.499 --> 00:03:58.069
 and so I laid out 

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:00.130
 so say your first sarah 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:03.049
 of this patent message 

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:05.589
 and here it immediately appeared 

00:04:05.589 --> 00:04:08.809
 ps installation than busy 

00:04:08.809 --> 00:04:10.419
 percentage accordingly 

00:04:10.419 --> 00:04:12.649
 the next menu item is search 

00:04:12.649 --> 00:04:14.180
 but here you can say 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:16.820
 anything just like Twitter and 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:19.650
 if something wrote about it that it certainly 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:22.650
 children 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:30.860
 Well, I have updated 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:33.860
 list of references 

00:04:37.599 --> 00:04:40.599
 kazagro that 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:48.520
 uah 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:51.240
 so the next menu item is 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.479
 tourists in whom he has been remembered and 

00:04:53.479 --> 00:04:56.000
 according to the sheet and the thieves that you have 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:56.879
 there is 

00:04:56.879 --> 00:04:59.360
 but since Iâ€™m not one of my paging 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:00.930
 added something here here 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:02.930
 here it is generally empty 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:05.470
 Jscp next button like lfl that is 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:06.740
 update this 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:09.699
 update what window is hidden 

00:05:09.699 --> 00:05:11.779
 Mom cites a mention further 

00:05:11.779 --> 00:05:14.439
 There is a setting in the settings all the items 

00:05:14.439 --> 00:05:17.219
 menu including fouler's private messages 

00:05:17.219 --> 00:05:19.439
 there are those who follow the rights 

00:05:19.439 --> 00:05:23.080
 third period imaginary message search 

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:25.249
 news but in general everything is everything 

00:05:25.249 --> 00:05:27.800
 here it is me accordingly 

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:30.889
 ap cancel it i.e. exit back to itself 

00:05:30.889 --> 00:05:33.370
 program and exit is here 

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:35.139
 this is probably all that can be said about 

00:05:35.139 --> 00:05:36.779
 kamgold client 

00:05:36.779 --> 00:05:38.150
 for Russia gently 

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:40.800
 unfortunately now I did not notice in it 

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:43.540
 the functionality for the work of the squeaks of the box office 

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:45.570
 but nonetheless I think of soon 

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:48.680
 all the same thing is built useful 

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:50.949
