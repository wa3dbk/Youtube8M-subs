give you the extra inches because you

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:43.270 
give you the extra inches because you
might<00:06:41.480> have<00:06:41.660> to<00:06:41.780> cut<00:06:41.990> the<00:06:42.080> ends<00:06:42.560> but<00:06:42.800> that<00:06:43.130> was

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:43.280 
might have to cut the ends but that was
