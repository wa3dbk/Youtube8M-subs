00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160
 it's amazing how mistakes can be made 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.899
 invent and create innovative recipes 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:10.380
 I was in the kitchen and I was trying to 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:12.000
 formulate wines and vegans but these 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.710
 goods are in cooking were not wanted 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.020
 just inflate and I had become 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.670
 so sad what i decided to 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:21.090
 throw it all away though de tomassi 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:23.250
 in the tasting 1 incredible yummy e 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.439
 today I can't wait to offer you in fact 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.019
 these wholemeal vegan cookies 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:30.269
 very good indeed we will cover with 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.920
 a cast of wholemeal caramel seen 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:35.670
 that we are in perfect kramer hours theme 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:38.460
 sweeper 30 grams of linseed 70 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.840
 milliliters of water a pinch of salt e 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.899
 a teaspoon of brown sugar 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:45.739
 integral 50 milliliters of seed oil 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:48.840
 corn 70 grams of whole wheat flour 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:51.180
 for the caramel 100 grams of pulled 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.070
 whole brown sugar a spoon 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.620
 of water 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:58.440
 we begin to realize the first 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:01.079
 flaxseed paste in a blender or 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:04.049
 pour the flaxseed that is now minced 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:06.890
 finely I poured the seed powder 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:09.420
 divine in a small bowl I finish the water 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:11.880
 muscle and jolie so that the 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:15.240
 mucilages present form with water 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:17.549
 a pasty mass the mass of seeds of 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.790
 linen will serve us as an alternative to 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.790
 eggs 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:25.049
 we set aside in about 3 4 minutes 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.860
 you will see that a mass will be formed 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.680
 gelatinous 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:33.490
 now we move to a saucepan 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:35.640
 pour the soy milk a pinch of 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:35.640
 salt 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:39.820
 a teaspoon of brown sugar 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:41.410
 integral we do not abound with sugar 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:43.780
 at this stage also because then 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:47.200
 cover our cakes with the 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:48.700
 wholemeal caramel follows 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:54.520
 practically the same procedure as yes 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:56.890
 makes with classic wines at this stage 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:02:00.450
 we also add 5 tablespoons of oil to the oil 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:00.450
 instead of butter 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:05.220
 we mix we count in boiling 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:11.500
 when it begins to boil it 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:14.070
 we remove from the fire and we are true 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:17.290
 whole wheat together so 

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:20.830
 immediately drugs will be formed and then yes 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:23.190
 instead he will have to create a ball like the 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:27.790
 I said a compact march was formed 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:34.959
 we bring back on the fire and cook for 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:37.450
 about another minute here later 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:41.260
 about a minute you can see one 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:44.260
 film below we remove from 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:49.540
 fire and move 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:51.310
 or rather we move on a bowl 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:53.379
 we wait a few moments so that the 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:55.720
 compound unites unlike 

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:57.700
 cowardly classics and we must not wait 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:02.920
 absolute cooling with a total 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:06.370
 because we won't add the eggs is 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:08.379
 the time has come to combine the pasta of 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:10.780
 flaxseed you see that it is compacted 

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:12.870
 compared to before 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:17.220
 flax seeds as I said before 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:17.220
 they will be the alternative to eggs 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:22.599
 let's mix the mixture well 

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:25.980
 then we will transfer it to an auction 

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:25.980
 capoccia with smooth spout 

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:35.190
 now I have placed a paper pole 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:37.770
 oven on a plate or for the heated 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:41.520
 in the oven at 200 degrees 

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:44.040
 we make little tufts 

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:45.930
 spaced apart from each other and then 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:48.330
 we can also work with our hands 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:50.120
 I already see to form one 

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:54.660
 ball 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:04:00.990
 here we are proceeding in this way up to 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:04:02.910
 run out of all the dough or so 

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:05.280
 also made all the balls in 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:07.709
 hot oven at 200 grams let's cook 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:09.780
 for about 15 minutes later we lower the 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:10.800
 temperature at 180 and we continue to 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:13.410
 another 10 minutes 

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:16.109
 let it cool in the oven and then 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:18.269
 we can proceed with the decoration 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:20.130
 here we have baked our own 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:22.830
 very much vegan biscuits 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:24.540
 details and now we also do the 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:26.550
 composition I took a plate or 

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:27.990
 arranged some end I made a base 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:30.840
 we said we are on the subject 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:33.450
 carnival and we also want to adapt them 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:36.510
 at this time we will therefore implement a 

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:38.970
 wholemeal caramel a kind of 

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:41.930
 struffoli a species 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:46.910
 we take a casserole light 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:51.449
 Pour the whole cane sugar 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:53.400
 add the spoon of water and 

00:04:51.449 --> 00:04:57.479
 with the thermometer we calculate the 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:05:00.120
 reaching 160 165 degrees 

00:04:57.479 --> 00:05:03.150
 after which we will have to act quickly and 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:10.260
 we will pour the caramel on top of ours 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:12.570
 165 degree layered biscuits and time of 

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:15.150
 immediately remove the caramel from the heat 

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:18.780
 we wait a few moments 

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:23.580
 we mix and then the shadow is over i 

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:26.220
 our biscuits we can alternatively 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:34.560
 also put all arranged inside 

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:37.470
 of the pan in layers then we put 

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:43.830
 above rise and biscuits attention to 

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:46.710
 do not persist with the caramel it is 

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:49.740
 as decoration I propose to you 

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:52.740
 a colorful colored coconut with what 

00:05:49.740 --> 00:06:00.870
 with a solution composed of qq and a 

00:05:52.740 --> 00:06:03.090
 little little vegetable milk was Roman 

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:05.070
 mestre persevere is diabolical in this 

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:06.690
 case of error side a delight 

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:10.310
 carnevalis among all the good effects 

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:10.310
 carnival to everyone with these minutes
