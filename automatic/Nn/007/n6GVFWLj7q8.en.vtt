alright<00:00:00.420> hydrogen<00:00:01.199> generator<00:00:01.560> update<00:00:02.159> after

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:02.760 
alright hydrogen generator update after

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.530 
alright hydrogen generator update after
yesterday's<00:00:03.750> experiment<00:00:04.350> of<00:00:04.710> boiling<00:00:05.250> water

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:05.540 
yesterday's experiment of boiling water

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:11.060 
yesterday's experiment of boiling water
I've<00:00:06.950> gone<00:00:07.950> ahead<00:00:08.130> and<00:00:08.340> added<00:00:09.710> two<00:00:10.710> plates

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
I've gone ahead and added two plates

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.910 
I've gone ahead and added two plates
positive<00:00:11.790> and<00:00:12.150> two<00:00:12.900> plates<00:00:13.259> negatives<00:00:13.740> are

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
positive and two plates negatives are

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.970 
positive and two plates negatives are
you<00:00:14.009> can't<00:00:14.190> see<00:00:14.340> the<00:00:14.429> bottom<00:00:14.549> half<00:00:14.730> with<00:00:15.719> a

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:15.980 
you can't see the bottom half with a

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:19.700 
you can't see the bottom half with a
separator<00:00:16.980> plate<00:00:17.369> in<00:00:17.609> between<00:00:18.180> and<00:00:18.710> we've

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
separator plate in between and we've

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:25.340 
separator plate in between and we've
also<00:00:19.920> gone<00:00:20.279> to<00:00:20.520> a<00:00:20.550> larger<00:00:21.240> washer<00:00:24.170> we'll<00:00:25.170> go

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
also gone to a larger washer we'll go

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:33.819 
also gone to a larger washer we'll go
ahead<00:00:25.439> and<00:00:25.619> add<00:00:26.539> power<00:00:27.539> to<00:00:27.930> this<00:00:30.560> and<00:00:32.630> I

00:00:33.819 --> 00:00:33.829 
ahead and add power to this and I

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:38.510 
ahead and add power to this and I
adjusted<00:00:34.829> my<00:00:35.300> baking<00:00:36.300> soda<00:00:36.750> I<00:00:37.200> do<00:00:37.980> believe<00:00:38.280> I'm

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
adjusted my baking soda I do believe I'm

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.250 
adjusted my baking soda I do believe I'm
at<00:00:39.140> two<00:00:40.140> teaspoons<00:00:41.040> in<00:00:41.510> this<00:00:42.510> solution<00:00:42.930> right

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
at two teaspoons in this solution right

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:49.459 
at two teaspoons in this solution right
now<00:00:44.600> so<00:00:45.600> that<00:00:46.020> my<00:00:47.420> boil<00:00:48.420> I<00:00:48.750> wanted<00:00:49.230> a<00:00:49.289> good

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
now so that my boil I wanted a good

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.619 
now so that my boil I wanted a good
Boyle<00:00:49.770> rate<00:00:50.100> without<00:00:51.059> a<00:00:51.300> lot<00:00:51.690> of<00:00:51.840> heat<00:00:52.199> and

00:00:53.619 --> 00:00:53.629 
Boyle rate without a lot of heat and

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:56.000 
Boyle rate without a lot of heat and
salt<00:00:54.629> let<00:00:54.809> this<00:00:54.989> sit<00:00:55.260> here<00:00:55.440> and<00:00:55.590> boil<00:00:55.890> for

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
salt let this sit here and boil for

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.299 
salt let this sit here and boil for
probably<00:00:56.690> ten<00:00:57.690> minutes<00:00:58.079> and<00:00:58.379> then<00:00:58.680> measure<00:00:58.980> my

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
probably ten minutes and then measure my

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:06.080 
probably ten minutes and then measure my
my<00:01:00.000> heat<00:01:00.510> on<00:01:00.829> my<00:01:01.829> fluid<00:01:02.640> so<00:01:03.210> see<00:01:03.840> in<00:01:03.960> 10<00:01:05.090> alright

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
my heat on my fluid so see in 10 alright

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.010 
my heat on my fluid so see in 10 alright
10<00:01:06.390> minutes<00:01:06.720> has<00:01:06.869> gone<00:01:06.930> by<00:01:07.110> and<00:01:07.799> we<00:01:09.020> are

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
10 minutes has gone by and we are

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.890 
10 minutes has gone by and we are
currently<00:01:10.380> sitting<00:01:10.890> at<00:01:11.100> almost<00:01:12.090> a<00:01:12.540> hundred

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
currently sitting at almost a hundred

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.450 
currently sitting at almost a hundred
and<00:01:13.320> eighty<00:01:13.619> degrees<00:01:15.229> so<00:01:16.229> my<00:01:16.650> solution<00:01:17.250> is<00:01:17.400> a

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
and eighty degrees so my solution is a

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.910 
and eighty degrees so my solution is a
bit<00:01:17.880> thick<00:01:18.330> so<00:01:18.869> what<00:01:19.200> we're<00:01:19.350> going<00:01:19.470> to<00:01:19.560> do<00:01:19.710> is

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
bit thick so what we're going to do is

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.999 
bit thick so what we're going to do is
we're<00:01:20.159> going<00:01:20.250> to<00:01:20.340> pour<00:01:20.610> this<00:01:20.790> out<00:01:21.060> and<00:01:21.740> go<00:01:22.740> with

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
we're going to pour this out and go with

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.200 
we're going to pour this out and go with
the<00:01:23.930> less<00:01:24.930> baking<00:01:25.380> soda<00:01:25.650> and<00:01:25.890> see<00:01:26.670> if<00:01:26.790> we<00:01:26.939> can't

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
the less baking soda and see if we can't

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.370 
the less baking soda and see if we can't
get<00:01:27.360> that<00:01:27.630> bad<00:01:27.869> boy<00:01:28.140> down<00:01:28.619> in<00:01:29.329> the<00:01:30.329> 120<00:01:30.930> 130

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
get that bad boy down in the 120 130

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:38.859 
get that bad boy down in the 120 130
range<00:01:32.869> alright<00:01:34.100> we<00:01:35.100> dumped<00:01:35.520> our<00:01:35.640> fluid<00:01:36.090> and

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:38.869 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:41.660 

this<00:01:39.869> time<00:01:40.170> we<00:01:40.350> used<00:01:40.530> a<00:01:40.710> little<00:01:40.920> less<00:01:41.130> baking

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
this time we used a little less baking

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.200 
this time we used a little less baking
soda<00:01:42.000> and<00:01:43.100> let's<00:01:44.100> see<00:01:44.340> here<00:01:44.520> if<00:01:44.640> I<00:01:44.729> can<00:01:44.880> get<00:01:44.970> you

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
soda and let's see here if I can get you

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.560 
soda and let's see here if I can get you
on<00:01:45.240> this<00:01:45.860> we<00:01:46.860> are<00:01:46.920> currently<00:01:47.430> at<00:01:47.729> right<00:01:48.360> at<00:01:48.540> a

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
on this we are currently at right at a

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.859 
on this we are currently at right at a
hundred<00:01:48.930> degrees<00:01:50.030> our<00:01:51.030> productions<00:01:51.659> are

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
hundred degrees our productions are

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:59.170 
hundred degrees our productions are
quite<00:01:52.350> a<00:01:52.380> bit<00:01:52.649> lower<00:01:53.600> but<00:01:56.299> average<00:01:57.299> wise<00:01:57.570> and

00:01:59.170 --> 00:01:59.180 
quite a bit lower but average wise and

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:05.330 
quite a bit lower but average wise and
what<00:02:00.180> we<00:02:00.360> need<00:02:00.659> to<00:02:02.600> to<00:02:03.600> get<00:02:03.719> it<00:02:03.869> get<00:02:04.200> it<00:02:04.340> working

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
what we need to to get it get it working

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.119 
what we need to to get it get it working
properly<00:02:05.369> that's<00:02:06.350> you're<00:02:07.350> gonna<00:02:07.500> sacrifice

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
properly that's you're gonna sacrifice

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:11.420 
properly that's you're gonna sacrifice
for<00:02:08.729> one<00:02:08.910> for<00:02:09.149> the<00:02:09.239> other<00:02:09.560> so

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
for one for the other so

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.869 
for one for the other so
for<00:02:12.329> this<00:02:12.510> vehicle<00:02:12.750> I<00:02:13.109> will<00:02:13.290> probably<00:02:13.500> add<00:02:13.879> two

00:02:14.869 --> 00:02:14.879 
for this vehicle I will probably add two

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:18.950 
for this vehicle I will probably add two
of<00:02:15.030> these<00:02:15.180> generators<00:02:15.810> all<00:02:16.769> right
