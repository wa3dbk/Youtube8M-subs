00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:19.520
 It is Hirota symbiosis of Hello everybody oboe 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:23.740
 On a regular basis in November 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:28.260
 We will play Martinu's oboe frenzy 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:34.600
 There are not many oboe crazy songs 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:39.350
 Has been said to be one of one song three oboe to prosperous songs in it because round 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:44.030
 When certain one there divert the rehearsal and is Martinet 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:50.630
 Martin's degree is the birthplace of this conductor's windmill 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:53.780
 I am very much looking forward to being able to be together in his interpretation 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:56.000
 I think there are so many things to be taught to him 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:59.570
 About the roundness of the home 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:07.070
 I want to play together and feel and oboe 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:09.020
 Wow, before you, as a soloist with you now, to come to other instruments 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:11.250
 Less when 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:16.159
 I think it's gummy 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:18.200
 Remember that it is a flower-shaped instrument in the pits too 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:21.530
 I as a soloist 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:26.350
 Unfortunately I don't want to be in a position 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:32.530
 One of them may be that there is little repertory 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:35.400
 Quite place and it is concentrated in the Baroque era the majority of the oboe repertoire 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:40.860
 By the time the lock-on to take a short 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:42.760
 Today's one song takes less than 10 minutes to be taken up at the General Assembly and heard by everyone 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:46.560
 Because it is almost 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:48.320
 Of course there are also several songs in a row 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.420
 Like this time 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:53.290
 Still a few for longer insects 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:59.020
 It will be limited 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:02:00.750
 also customers who will make you feel a made or a little short because the x city is an 8-minute concerto 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:02.980
 You may come 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:07.480
 But the content is 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:09.200
 One movement that is very fulfilling is also very good 

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:10.810
 Martim seems 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.950
 Sound ko 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:17.360
 There are 2 movements 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:20.490
 That former husband painter field's and I said that say Leicester 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:25.020
 Almost all are moving like a point tour 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:30.400
 3 movement is a very light mountain award very reminiscent of dance 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:33.690
 And in that sense it says that two cadenzas are facing up 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:41.670
 This is a new publisher 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:43.470
 I use the publication of things, but in old-fashioned publication there was only one month but recent new 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:46.020
 In the process 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:49.330
 We have prepared two bells 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:50.940
 I think it is one of the low places 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:53.370
 Please to everyone like 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:59.569
 I am looking forward 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:59.569
