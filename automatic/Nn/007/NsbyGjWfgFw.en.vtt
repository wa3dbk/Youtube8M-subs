episode just I noticed that this episode

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:56.339 
episode just I noticed that this episode
is<00:02:53.860> really<00:02:53.950> orientated<00:02:54.849> on<00:02:55.060> mech<00:02:55.690> vs.<00:02:56.110> mech

00:02:56.339 --> 00:02:56.349 
is really orientated on mech vs. mech

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:59.160 
is really orientated on mech vs. mech
but<00:02:56.980> it's<00:02:57.400> not<00:02:57.610> nothing<00:02:58.090> that's<00:02:58.390> major<00:02:58.840> an

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170 
but it's not nothing that's major an

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:01.110 
but it's not nothing that's major an
issue<00:02:59.440> getting<00:02:59.980> on<00:03:00.190> to<00:03:00.310> the<00:03:00.340> real<00:03:00.549> topics<00:03:01.000> of

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
issue getting on to the real topics of

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.360 
issue getting on to the real topics of
discussion<00:03:01.690> though<00:03:01.810> with<00:03:02.470> the<00:03:02.560> episode<00:03:03.040> there
