to<00:02:19.890> look<00:02:20.010> at

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:23.270 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:26.000 

initially<00:02:24.270> these<00:02:24.450> was<00:02:25.050> supposed<00:02:25.350> to<00:02:25.500> go<00:02:25.650> on<00:02:25.800> to

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
initially these was supposed to go on to

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.900 
initially these was supposed to go on to
the<00:02:26.130> dyma<00:02:26.580> and<00:02:27.350> unfortunately<00:02:28.430> it's<00:02:29.430> the

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
the dyma and unfortunately it's the

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:35.600 
the dyma and unfortunately it's the
old-style<00:02:30.690> clamp<00:02:32.420> and<00:02:33.420> it<00:02:33.780> didn't<00:02:34.080> fit<00:02:34.610> which

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
old-style clamp and it didn't fit which

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:37.640 
old-style clamp and it didn't fit which
is<00:02:35.640> a<00:02:36.150> good<00:02:36.540> thing<00:02:36.720> I<00:02:36.870> guess<00:02:36.930> because<00:02:37.440> this

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
is a good thing I guess because this

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:42.050 
is a good thing I guess because this
bike<00:02:37.830> now<00:02:38.070> has<00:02:38.280> it<00:02:38.490> and<00:02:40.040> it's<00:02:41.040> got<00:02:41.280> a<00:02:41.460> carbon

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060
