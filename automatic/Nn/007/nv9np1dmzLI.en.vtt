00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:13.440
 cool yes we are here now at bayers 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.299
 Modi and look at their brand new 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.890
 play with zombies all that for you 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:21.539
 or absolutely yes well 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:23.340
 and yes the city ​​explain set 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.750
 a little something to it yes, there I put it 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.590
 let's go so it's a cooperative one 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.240
 game 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.160
 We play a group of survivors 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.939
 up to six players is possible 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.689
 now have the sixth version 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.149
 built up 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.260
 you have different characters and you 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.870
 everyone can be there 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.700
 different specialists all clear 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.200
 can do so more or less well just to 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.680
 For example, if we do not have the zombies 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.670
 kill 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.860
 then the mission can not 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.539
 meet no survivors right there 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.160
 we were once surviving he has exactly 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.840
 right and the zombies won 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.570
 or more precisely, we all have just one 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.670
 Clearly and indeed do the 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.260
 player himself as I said cooperative 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.940
 try missions to fulfill it 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.969
 There should be quite different start 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.960
 of course with relatively light weight 

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:02.010
 Of course you will then also vision 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.539
 to make something easier 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.280
 to enter the game 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.689
 you are very very difficult 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.250
 difficult for me the first second 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.170
 sure not succeed so there is 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.000
 also given video games appeal he plays 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.619
 In any case, surviving the 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.030
 Survivors make their move and afterwards 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.330
 Of course, the bad zombies are coming too 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.860
 tuned 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:26.070
 they also do in train we want or 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:27.270
 not the zombies are the ones again 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.159
 main actor but we are actually 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.369
 think we are the survivors yes, too 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.780
 maybe the first first moment with that 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.060
 the chainsaw and there it is already here 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.259
 all clearly long but that 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.860
 zombie is exactly those are already pretty 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.659
 cool 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.369
 there are 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.829
 There are four different zombies once 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.359
 a cut that is is very slow 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.619
 also very easy to kill but he is 

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:47.789
 stop the waltz are very strong and 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.950
 unlikely many are out of those 

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:53.039
 then we have the runner that is too 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:55.709
 a slender zombie like this is 

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:57.030
 easy to kill but he is very 

00:01:55.709 --> 00:01:59.250
 strong because he is twice as fast as 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.509
 the other then we have the way of the 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.069
 night alone because if the 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:05.219
 he has two more he has turned up 

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:07.829
 this is really fat name 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:09.750
 program I would say if he too 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:12.019
 also comes with 20 cases so always 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.019
 in a pack of three 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:20.010
 but moment before you roll your 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:22.319
 Share it is even thicker just that 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.060
 here is the mutant zombie that is 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:25.410
 of course very very very strong and 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.459
 He is also very hard to kill because 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:29.010
 we need a lot of manpower 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:30.870
 at all how does the train only 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:33.049
 are the survivors turn and do 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:35.459
 then actions that can of course say 

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:36.930
 of course, and above all, of course 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:39.390
 zombies throats because that's the one 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:41.549
 main reason may accrue one of the game 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.390
 on the streets like here 

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:44.160
 zebra crossing 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:45.870
 These are the streets you can also walk in 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.400
 go building purely zombies can not 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:49.500
 kill it always depends on what 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.819
 For example, Hartmann has 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.650
 a rifle 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:53.940
 That's a weapon I can do 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.579
 actually from a plan to the 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:58.260
 another over shoot problem is though 

00:02:56.579 --> 00:02:59.609
 in the case of televisions, I am not so practiced 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.280
 So I shoot more or less 

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:03.630
 indiscriminately yes, unfortunately it is me 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.000
 always over there in the other one 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:08.130
 finds own players so the good ones 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.079
 so to speak, I'm always the first to meet 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:13.200
 good, so ideally shoot until then 

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:14.940
 where there is no good or I have to 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.530
 Give me a sacrifice because of that 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:17.940
 anyway practically in the zombie zugs um 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.290
 then hopps would go 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:20.579
 I can kill myself right there 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:22.169
 if I have so much ammo I all 

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:23.819
 Unfortunately vigorously convey the first 

00:03:22.169 --> 00:03:25.470
 taken but next to that 

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:28.739
 many zombies with a distance from it 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:30.060
 Once upon a time he died 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:32.130
 win anyway, hopefully yes 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.569
 So that's still possible later 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:35.519
 then I can find better things 

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:37.980
 as the target pipe that mounted practically 

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:39.150
 selected and then pretty much over 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.200
 but can shoot more accurately and then 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:43.260
 I practically shoot at my own 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:44.400
 player over and then specifically 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.430
 the zombies are just like that 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.439
 are also separated by weapons 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:49.879
 I have directly from in front of the breast 

00:03:48.439 --> 00:03:51.439
 then it depends on what you weapons or 

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:53.390
 Special skills may have 

00:03:51.439 --> 00:03:55.099
 German or so then I can the 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:56.930
 kill if it is new beginning 

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:58.010
 maybe not but as a 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:01.760
 narrow then I can do that relatively 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:03.109
 easily kill the matter is still 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:05.389
 back to the gun or if I have the 

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:06.290
 door jumped I also do loud that is called 

00:04:05.389 --> 00:04:08.989
 I make noise 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:10.219
 because basically, let's say I 

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:11.359
 now have a few that's it 

00:04:10.219 --> 00:04:12.799
 already quite good but come now 

00:04:11.359 --> 00:04:14.599
 unfortunately the bad ones are also if the 

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:15.829
 they always come in first 

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:16.370
 Looking up when you have fresh blood 

00:04:15.829 --> 00:04:18.470
 see 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:20.030
 but then if you do not see anyone 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:21.739
 then they move in the direction where 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:23.780
 Noise is therefore where it is loudest 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:25.669
 that means everyone is moving anyway 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:26.960
 if you have at least one noise anyway 

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:28.820
 Of course we have the unions 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:30.050
 or a door has blown up then 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:31.639
 it is loud again and then you have 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:33.669
 Automatically then you have yourself 

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:37.910
 automatically the guys on the neck 

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:39.620
 rushed to say there you can politically 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:41.660
 to be correct but actually they are 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:45.740
 neither boys nor girls are just it 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:48.440
 is exactly silent weapons such as the 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:49.669
 baseball bat making no noise 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:51.770
 practically comparable to german 

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:53.150
 That 's a melee weapon then 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:58.520
 There are many elements 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:05:00.139
 For example, you can even go to the 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:01.669
 car you can get in but of course 

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:02.930
 again problem only if no 

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:04.580
 zombie is there because it takes time in the 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:06.800
 moment and then come up to four 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:09.110
 So you also have places 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:10.760
 can take players with the car 

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:14.690
 start and of course surprising 

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:16.310
 Wise zombies but that does too 

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:18.710
 of course learning only in the car is clear 

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:19.310
 is not an electric car to bamm bamm 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:21.880
 bamm 

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:24.320
 the roles are clearly distributed 

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:25.250
 yes i can kill then but problem 

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:27.650
 Again, I can not handle all the kids 

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:29.090
 that is the slender you can 

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:30.410
 just run over at the thick then 

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:31.610
 So he takes meat the car harm so 

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:34.220
 in principle, it did not even go 

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:35.720
 otherwise it goes to the bbi one 

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:37.160
 to survive harm it is there 

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:39.290
 not equal to dead he first has one 

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:41.060
 sore and then it is logical 

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:42.380
 wounded and next time would be 

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:43.460
 then hoops gone then we have 

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:45.889
 survive because won 

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:47.600
 he has fulfilled his vision i believe it 

00:05:45.889 --> 00:05:48.830
 There are ten or eleven different mission 

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:50.150
 lighter or heavier 

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:55.580
 you can increase you 

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:57.020
 Variation and you can play the field 

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:58.610
 it always changes so there is always 

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:59.990
 new again always build anew 

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:02.690
 For example, here is the street 

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:04.039
 the size of the building is very different for me 

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:05.870
 perhaps more protected by the 

00:06:04.039 --> 00:06:07.520
 Zombies could do it themselves or must 

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:10.370
 yourself around the corner so depending on 

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:11.930
 There is also variability 

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:14.720
 to point out again that you are me 

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:16.669
 I've just finished mama's shotgun 

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:22.419
 really used a cool weapon 

00:06:16.669 --> 00:06:22.419
 deer all know and love 

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:27.020
 I think it will be very exciting me 

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:28.520
 right now box or a little bit too 

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:29.720
 if you play it in the evening 

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:31.039
 friends plays in the twilight 

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:32.690
 maybe a bit scary music 

00:06:31.039 --> 00:06:34.520
 and then when the zombies on the track 

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:37.220
 you are already a few survivors 

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:46.450
 lost because it will likely 

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:48.979
 is also exciting long autumn evenings 

00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:51.560
 or winter but I would say that 

00:06:48.979 --> 00:06:55.210
 meet with a few people play this 

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:55.210
 already at home 

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:16.880
 especially pretty and of course with 

00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:18.380
 helmet and get is not only but 

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:19.550
 it helps me in the fight as well 

00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:21.590
 me on the field 

00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:23.960
 you are in and play against them 

00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:25.550
 I have to run a circuit board 

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:27.890
