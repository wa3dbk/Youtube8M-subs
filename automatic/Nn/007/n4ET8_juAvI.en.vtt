00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:50.290 
I can't really see anything and it was

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:52.250 
I can't really see anything and it was
only<00:03:50.440> some<00:03:50.799> of<00:03:50.829> the<00:03:50.980> drivers<00:03:51.250> that<00:03:51.670> were

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
only some of the drivers that were

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.650 
only some of the drivers that were
swerving<00:03:53.260> in<00:03:53.530> that<00:03:53.680> part<00:03:53.980> I<00:03:54.250> think<00:03:55.239> they're

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:55.660
