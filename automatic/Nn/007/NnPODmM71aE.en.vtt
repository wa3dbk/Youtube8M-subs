00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.769
 Welcome to the channel, she's hot. 

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:18.760
 activity 2014 

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:22.960
 with you an engine fire 1.0 eight 

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:25.890
 I'm going to show you that 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:28.960
 happens when the oil change is postponed 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:34.680
 Look at the amount of rubber that 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:38.590
 formed due to the exchange of water from the oil 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:42.300
 show that the back cover 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:42.300
 Look at the smoke mouth. 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:52.150
 so folks this good here 

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:55.130
 was due to the delayed oil change 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:56.840
 and this good deposit character 

00:00:55.130 --> 00:01:02.210
 after showing that you the postman 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:06.080
 underneath and the oil pump pulls the 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:07.660
 crankcase oil and shit like this 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:11.690
 she in high cross 

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:16.090
 is making tupi oil filter in tupi 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:16.090
 pump and with this not checking engine 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:35.970
 here giving sequence I'll show part 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:40.660
 low engine without the card 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:42.660
 you will see a level that is this motor 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:45.160
 of good oil 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:47.110
 I took pictures here too. 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:52.330

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:55.060
 the level that arrived this one does not 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:02:02.890
 they exchanged look time 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:07.990
 I have a friend who is also a tip to 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:12.880
 You see there always use recommended oil 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:16.660
 and always switch in the foreseen period 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:19.360
 to avoid white engine ' and for lack of 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:22.200
 lubrication that's it guys who 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:27.660

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:27.660
