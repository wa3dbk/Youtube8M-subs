00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:06.240
 hi to all the boys and welcome to 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.950
 a new video on my channel today as 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.469
 you will have certainly noticed from the title e 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.330
 as you have surely guessed from the 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.759
 end of last video 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.920
 we're going to unbox an 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:22.340
 unboxing this camera 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:26.970
 the 5.200 will have an accessory 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:30.779
 goal nikkor 18 55 but let's go to 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:34.110
 see the box we have on one side 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.940
 always the photograph of the machine 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.160
 photo from this other side instead 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.080
 we will have the accessories contained 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.260
 inside the box and the system 

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:45.090
 operational required but who the fuck if any 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.800
 scrub the box let's see what's on 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.960
 inside 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:53.850
 so the package will contain a cd for 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:56.490
 surely the driver installation is 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.500
 a guide to using the 

00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:01.230
 camera in various languages 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.240
 the warranty with other papers a 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.390
 manual that from what I understand will be 

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:08.010
 completely the german usb cable for 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.440
 connect the camera 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.980
 directly to our pc a cable 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:15.570
 component that surely will serve us for 

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:18.330
 see our images and our videos 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.880
 directly on our TV the car 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.740
 photo we're going to see after the 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.360
 camera battery and the 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.010
 its relative charger 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.070
 last thing inside ours 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:30.450
 box but not for importance will be the 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.400
 our goal that we are going to see 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.990
 calmly another lit up that I have 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.780
 purchased for the camera is 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:39.060
 this extra battery since i am 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.460
 I am informed is the camera 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.700
 in recording video editing the 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:48.360
 battery in about 15 to 20 minutes maximum 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:51.240
 25 so this is the content goal 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.600
 inside our packaging 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.400
 as you can see a zoom lens 18 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:58.440
 55 and a stabilized target 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:00.210
 in fact through this lever we could 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:02.010
 activate or deactivate the 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:05.080
 image stabilization 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:08.010
 video photo that is is instead from this 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:11.710
 reality lever we can decide if 

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:14.080
 use automatic or manual fire no 

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:16.900
 guys sorry it's not a weapon it is 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.490
 simply focusing 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.590
 guys this is the camera 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:22.270
 in all its splendor 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:25.210
 you can see that this applied the 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:28.000
 Nikon strap is a head to be able to refer to 

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:32.580
 mount the camera to three 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:36.340
 feet or monopods I also applied a 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:39.370
 glass display protector to prevent that 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:41.590
 you can scratch it as you can see 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:44.380
 now a peculiarity of this 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:48.190
 camera and that ours 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:53.350
 screen can rotate and separate 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:55.060
 let's say from dal the car body like that 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:57.520
 that we can afford better 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:00.040
 visual given that in the event that we 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:02.950
 we were in the sunlight or 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:05.440
 we were simply on the other side 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:09.340
 of the camera we will not do 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:11.650
 other than putting so the display is 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.700
 so we can see each other directly 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:15.910
 so see what we are 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:18.040
 registering boys this is another 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:20.080
 goal I possessed as you can 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:23.380
 see your own lens hood a 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:27.010
 unlike the other and it is a goal 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:29.739
 17 55 therefore very similar to that 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:32.980
 previously shown also fire 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:34.870
 manual or automatic however the 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:37.600
 particularity of this objective that it has 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:39.830
 a ring nut another ring that allows 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:43.520
 to adjust the fire in case you don't 

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:45.350
 we used it manually 

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:47.810
 another particularity certainly of 

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:49.490
 this goal and that is due therefore 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:52.400
 compared to the goal shown in 

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:55.010
 previously that 35 56 we have the 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:57.320
 possibility to take photographs or 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:59.570
 shoot video must be no lower 

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:01.310
 intensity of light on this medium 

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:03.500
 camera we can immediately 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:04.850
 note a rubber grommet that if lifted there 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:06.980
 reveals the four attacks that the 

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:09.800
 ie camera possesses 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:11.060
 that hdmi one to connect 

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:13.760
 directly our car 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:15.530
 photo to the pc the one to connect or 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:16.760
 an external microphone and one for 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:18.410
 view our photos 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:20.120
 and our videos directly on 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:21.680
 our tv on the back of ours 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:23.900
 camera we can see 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:26.000
 in addition to the display to the eyepiece the various keys 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:28.880
 which are present on almost all of them 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.230
 reflex of this band beyond that is the 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:32.360
 wheel that will allow us to 

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:35.180
 select time diaphragm in the case 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:37.190
 where we used the setting 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:41.030
 manual for taking pictures or recording 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:42.860
 video looking down on ours 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:44.810
 reflex we can immediately notice a 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:47.090
 microphone that is stereo so we will have 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:49.940
 excellent quality in recording audio 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:52.100
 of our videos and we can also 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:54.919
 note a wheel that will allow us to 

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:57.440
 select how we are going to perform 

00:04:54.919 --> 00:04:59.510
 our photographs or our shots 

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:01.280
 in addition we have one next to it 

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:03.919
 lever that will allow us a lot 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:05.030
 easily to peel from video and 

00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:07.750
 photography 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:11.840
 in addition we have a button that will be used to 

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:14.480
 carrying our videos is the usual key 

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:16.280
 to take pictures and more 

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:18.350
 lever that will allow us to turn off and 

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:20.480
 turn on our camera 

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:22.820
 on the latter side we will have one 

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:25.190
 door that opened up will reveal us 

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:28.150
 at the entrance of our card 

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:30.680
 if not how the fuck we record the videos 

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:32.300
 well guys the video ends here 

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:34.010

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:42.860
 particular of this machine 

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:45.140
 photographic 

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:46.520

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:49.790
 still done for later 

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:52.190
 stay

 from roth and all closed 

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:06.770
 however, solving the puzzle is guessing what 

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:06.770
 will be in the next video
