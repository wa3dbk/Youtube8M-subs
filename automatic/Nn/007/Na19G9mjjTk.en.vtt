sugar<00:02:31.400> and<00:02:31.880> add<00:02:32.300> that<00:02:32.510> into<00:02:32.660> the<00:02:32.780> mixture<00:02:32.870> you

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
sugar and add that into the mixture you

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:35.260 
sugar and add that into the mixture you
just<00:02:33.830> want<00:02:33.980> to<00:02:34.040> lay<00:02:34.400> ingredients<00:02:34.940> combined

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:35.270 
just want to lay ingredients combined

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:36.910 
just want to lay ingredients combined
before<00:02:35.480> you<00:02:35.720> added<00:02:36.020> more<00:02:36.200> sugar<00:02:36.410> so<00:02:36.709> that's

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
before you added more sugar so that's

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.890 
before you added more sugar so that's
why<00:02:37.190> we're<00:02:37.370> adding<00:02:37.730> more<00:02:38.209> sugar<00:02:38.420> in<00:02:38.630> at<00:02:38.780> this

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
why we're adding more sugar in at this

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:40.449 
why we're adding more sugar in at this
point<00:02:39.170> and<00:02:39.440> you're<00:02:39.560> just<00:02:39.739> going<00:02:39.950> to<00:02:40.010> mix<00:02:40.220> that

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:40.459 
point and you're just going to mix that

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:46.990 
point and you're just going to mix that
all<00:02:40.640> in<00:02:45.340> and<00:02:46.340> you<00:02:46.459> should<00:02:46.610> get<00:02:46.670> a<00:02:46.730> pretty

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000 
all in and you should get a pretty

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.690 
all in and you should get a pretty
smooth<00:02:47.360> consistency<00:02:48.220> so<00:02:49.220> now<00:02:49.340> you're<00:02:49.550> going

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 
smooth consistency so now you're going

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:51.490 
smooth consistency so now you're going
to<00:02:49.760> add<00:02:49.970> drops<00:02:50.540> of<00:02:50.690> food<00:02:50.810> coloring<00:02:51.140> I<00:02:51.260> added

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 
to add drops of food coloring I added

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.160 
to add drops of food coloring I added
about<00:02:51.709> 8<00:02:52.040> of<00:02:52.370> the<00:02:53.360> blue<00:02:53.540> and<00:02:53.690> I'm<00:02:53.810> just<00:02:53.989> mixing

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.170 
about 8 of the blue and I'm just mixing

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:59.410 
about 8 of the blue and I'm just mixing
that<00:02:54.470> in<00:02:57.250> you<00:02:58.250> get<00:02:58.430> a<00:02:58.459> really<00:02:58.850> pretty<00:02:59.180> blue

00:02:59.410 --> 00:02:59.420 
that in you get a really pretty blue

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:02.440 
that in you get a really pretty blue
aqua<00:02:59.930> color<00:03:00.140> if<00:03:00.440> you<00:03:00.739> use<00:03:01.130> that<00:03:01.459> many<00:03:01.970> drops<00:03:02.239> of

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450 
aqua color if you use that many drops of

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:04.720 
aqua color if you use that many drops of
food<00:03:02.569> coloring<00:03:02.959> and<00:03:03.190> so<00:03:04.190> now<00:03:04.340> I've<00:03:04.519> got<00:03:04.700> a

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
food coloring and so now I've got a

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:07.690 
food coloring and so now I've got a
separate<00:03:05.090> bowl<00:03:05.299> and<00:03:05.540> I'm<00:03:05.660> pouring<00:03:05.959> in<00:03:06.640> 1/2<00:03:07.640> cup

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:07.700 
separate bowl and I'm pouring in 1/2 cup

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:12.520 
separate bowl and I'm pouring in 1/2 cup
of<00:03:09.280> regular<00:03:10.280> sugar<00:03:10.730> and<00:03:10.880> I'm<00:03:11.150> adding<00:03:11.540> I<00:03:12.140> think

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530 
of regular sugar and I'm adding I think

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:14.830 
of regular sugar and I'm adding I think
8<00:03:12.830> or<00:03:12.860> 7<00:03:13.459> drops<00:03:13.910> of<00:03:14.120> red<00:03:14.239> food<00:03:14.299> coloring<00:03:14.810> and

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840 
8 or 7 drops of red food coloring and

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.110 
8 or 7 drops of red food coloring and
I'm<00:03:15.110> mixing<00:03:15.410> that<00:03:15.590> in<00:03:15.830> and<00:03:16.099> it<00:03:16.700> takes<00:03:16.910> a<00:03:17.000> while

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 
I'm mixing that in and it takes a while

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.240 
I'm mixing that in and it takes a while
but<00:03:17.420> if<00:03:17.510> you<00:03:17.599> use<00:03:17.720> a<00:03:17.750> fork<00:03:18.080> and<00:03:18.349> you<00:03:18.769> blend<00:03:19.010> it

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.250 
but if you use a fork and you blend it

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:21.520 
but if you use a fork and you blend it
thoroughly<00:03:20.120> then<00:03:20.330> you'll<00:03:20.510> get<00:03:20.720> kind<00:03:21.110> of<00:03:21.200> light

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:21.530 
thoroughly then you'll get kind of light

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:23.500 
thoroughly then you'll get kind of light
pink<00:03:21.799> color<00:03:22.040> so<00:03:22.400> I<00:03:22.430> just<00:03:22.730> fast<00:03:22.970> forwarded<00:03:23.360> it

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:23.510 
pink color so I just fast forwarded it

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:26.650 
pink color so I just fast forwarded it
and<00:03:23.750> you<00:03:23.900> can<00:03:24.080> see<00:03:24.290> how<00:03:24.560> it<00:03:25.489> eventually<00:03:26.060> turns

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:26.660 
and you can see how it eventually turns

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:32.839 
and you can see how it eventually turns
into<00:03:26.810> sort<00:03:27.230> of<00:03:27.349> a<00:03:27.470> pinkish<00:03:28.010> color

00:03:32.839 --> 00:03:32.849 

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:34.670 

it's<00:03:33.480> pretty<00:03:33.840> smooth<00:03:34.170> and<00:03:34.260> there<00:03:34.409> shouldn't

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
it's pretty smooth and there shouldn't

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.110 
it's pretty smooth and there shouldn't
be<00:03:34.739> any<00:03:34.950> lumps<00:03:35.159> of<00:03:35.280> food<00:03:35.430> coloring<00:03:35.760> after<00:03:36.090> a

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
be any lumps of food coloring after a

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.300 
be any lumps of food coloring after a
while<00:03:36.329> so<00:03:37.019> now<00:03:37.170> I'll<00:03:37.319> gather<00:03:37.530> your<00:03:37.829> two<00:03:38.040> bowls

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
while so now I'll gather your two bowls

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:41.720 
while so now I'll gather your two bowls
and<00:03:38.579> your<00:03:39.239> mason<00:03:39.599> jar<00:03:39.810> or<00:03:40.049> any<00:03:40.670> sort<00:03:41.670> of

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
and your mason jar or any sort of

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:43.250 
and your mason jar or any sort of
container<00:03:41.999> that<00:03:42.180> you<00:03:42.389> have<00:03:42.629> I<00:03:42.930> just<00:03:43.139> like

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
container that you have I just like

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:44.809 
container that you have I just like
mason<00:03:43.590> jars<00:03:43.769> because<00:03:43.889> you<00:03:44.099> can<00:03:44.280> see<00:03:44.459> them<00:03:44.609> and

00:03:44.809 --> 00:03:44.819 
mason jars because you can see them and

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:46.039 
mason jars because you can see them and
it<00:03:45.060> looks<00:03:45.090> very<00:03:45.510> pretty

00:03:46.039 --> 00:03:46.049 
it looks very pretty

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:48.890 
it looks very pretty
so<00:03:46.560> I'm<00:03:46.709> measuring<00:03:47.219> out<00:03:47.340> 1/4<00:03:47.819> cup<00:03:48.060> of<00:03:48.299> my<00:03:48.569> pink

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
so I'm measuring out 1/4 cup of my pink

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:50.720 
so I'm measuring out 1/4 cup of my pink
mixture<00:03:49.319> and<00:03:49.590> I'm<00:03:49.889> dumping<00:03:50.129> that<00:03:50.370> into<00:03:50.609> the

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.730 
mixture and I'm dumping that into the

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:53.599 
mixture and I'm dumping that into the
bottom<00:03:51.090> of<00:03:51.120> the<00:03:51.599> mason<00:03:52.019> jar<00:03:52.200> now<00:03:53.010> I'm<00:03:53.250> pouring

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:53.609 
bottom of the mason jar now I'm pouring

00:03:53.609 --> 00:03:56.059 
bottom of the mason jar now I'm pouring
in<00:03:54.060> the<00:03:54.569> blue<00:03:54.930> mixture<00:03:55.290> and<00:03:55.500> you<00:03:55.650> just<00:03:55.859> want<00:03:56.040> to

00:03:56.059 --> 00:03:56.069 
in the blue mixture and you just want to

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:57.470 
in the blue mixture and you just want to
pour<00:03:56.310> it<00:03:56.340> all<00:03:56.489> the<00:03:56.609> way<00:03:56.670> to<00:03:56.730> the<00:03:56.879> top<00:03:57.090> until<00:03:57.329> you

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 
pour it all the way to the top until you

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:59.959 
pour it all the way to the top until you
have<00:03:57.659> just<00:03:57.840> enough<00:03:58.109> room<00:03:58.290> for<00:03:58.530> another<00:03:58.950> 1/4<00:03:59.760> of

00:03:59.959 --> 00:03:59.969 
have just enough room for another 1/4 of

00:03:59.969 --> 00:04:02.630 
have just enough room for another 1/4 of
the<00:04:00.090> pink<00:04:00.329> mixture

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:02.640 
the pink mixture

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:04.760 
the pink mixture
so<00:04:03.090> now<00:04:03.210> you<00:04:03.270> have<00:04:03.900> that<00:04:04.140> the<00:04:04.410> rest<00:04:04.620> of<00:04:04.710> the

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:04.770 
so now you have that the rest of the

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:06.020 
so now you have that the rest of the
pink<00:04:04.920> mixture<00:04:05.160> on<00:04:05.250> top<00:04:05.430> and<00:04:05.670> you're<00:04:05.850> just

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.030 
pink mixture on top and you're just

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:08.170 
pink mixture on top and you're just
going<00:04:06.180> to<00:04:06.210> Pat<00:04:06.450> that<00:04:06.630> down<00:04:06.660> into<00:04:07.080> place<00:04:07.170> and

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:08.180 
going to Pat that down into place and

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:11.000 
going to Pat that down into place and
that's<00:04:09.180> just<00:04:09.540> about<00:04:09.750> it<00:04:10.110> so<00:04:10.650> now<00:04:10.770> I'm<00:04:10.830> going<00:04:10.950> to

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.010 
that's just about it so now I'm going to

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:13.010 
that's just about it so now I'm going to
go<00:04:11.460> screw<00:04:11.730> the<00:04:11.850> lid<00:04:12.030> on<00:04:12.060> and<00:04:12.390> so<00:04:12.660> this<00:04:12.810> is<00:04:12.930> what

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:13.020 
go screw the lid on and so this is what

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:14.420 
go screw the lid on and so this is what
it<00:04:13.080> looks<00:04:13.230> like<00:04:13.320> when<00:04:13.470> it's<00:04:13.620> all<00:04:13.710> done<00:04:13.890> I<00:04:14.100> tied

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430 
it looks like when it's all done I tied

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:18.080 
it looks like when it's all done I tied
a<00:04:14.460> bow<00:04:14.730> on<00:04:14.940> the<00:04:15.060> top<00:04:15.360> and<00:04:15.750> I<00:04:16.680> have<00:04:16.739> my<00:04:17.580> name<00:04:17.820> tag

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
a bow on the top and I have my name tag

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:19.910 
a bow on the top and I have my name tag
on<00:04:18.239> the<00:04:18.330> top<00:04:18.540> for<00:04:19.019> whoever<00:04:19.410> I'm<00:04:19.560> going<00:04:19.709> to<00:04:19.830> give
