there is let's say a little mystery in
this<00:00:03.360> concept<00:00:03.990> about<00:00:04.370> collection<00:00:05.370> also

00:00:06.079 --> 00:00:06.089

we're<00:00:08.910> gonna<00:00:09.000> try<00:00:09.300> to<00:00:09.330> simplify<00:00:10.110> it<00:00:10.170> and<00:00:10.410> make

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
we're gonna try to simplify it and make

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:12.890 
we're gonna try to simplify it and make
it<00:00:11.130> available<00:00:11.219> to<00:00:11.849> even<00:00:12.000> a<00:00:12.210> most<00:00:12.450> novice

and<00:00:18.000> I<00:00:18.390> don't<00:00:18.690> mind<00:00:18.930> it<00:00:19.140> all<00:00:19.260> and<00:00:19.439> I<00:00:19.500> try<00:00:19.740> to<00:00:19.770> get

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
and I don't mind it all and I try to get

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.550 
and I don't mind it all and I try to get
my<00:00:20.340> novice<00:00:20.910> riders<00:00:21.300> to<00:00:21.510> start<00:00:21.779> putting<00:00:22.470> a

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
my novice riders to start putting a

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.080 
my novice riders to start putting a
little<00:00:22.740> bit<00:00:22.859> of<00:00:23.070> collection<00:00:23.490> into<00:00:23.699> their<00:00:23.850> ride

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
little bit of collection into their ride

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.779 
little bit of collection into their ride
fairly<00:00:24.930> early<00:00:25.109> on<00:00:25.289> as<00:00:25.859> soon<00:00:26.070> as<00:00:26.189> their<00:00:26.369> hands

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
fairly early on as soon as their hands

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.580 
fairly early on as soon as their hands
can<00:00:26.970> remain<00:00:27.269> quiet<00:00:27.570> in<00:00:27.779> front<00:00:27.990> of<00:00:28.080> the<00:00:28.170> saddle

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
can remain quiet in front of the saddle

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.560 
can remain quiet in front of the saddle
and<00:00:28.710> it<00:00:29.130> seems<00:00:29.400> as<00:00:29.609> though<00:00:29.760> they<00:00:29.910> can<00:00:29.970> not

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
and it seems as though they can not

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.150 
and it seems as though they can not
interfere<00:00:30.929> with<00:00:31.230> the<00:00:31.500> horse<00:00:31.710> but<00:00:31.949> rather

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
interfere with the horse but rather

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.400 
interfere with the horse but rather
compliment<00:00:32.880> the<00:00:33.000> horse<00:00:33.210> we<00:00:33.750> begin<00:00:34.110> to<00:00:34.230> teach

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
compliment the horse we begin to teach

compliment the horse we begin to teach
that<00:00:34.770> idea<00:00:35.190> of<00:00:35.309> collection<00:00:35.969> collection<00:00:36.809> is

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
that idea of collection collection is

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.250 
that idea of collection collection is
just<00:00:37.710> part<00:00:38.430> of<00:00:38.610> a<00:00:38.820> horse's<00:00:39.239> ability<00:00:39.870> to<00:00:40.079> what

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
just part of a horse's ability to what

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.110 
just part of a horse's ability to what
we<00:00:40.379> call<00:00:40.590> move<00:00:40.829> forward<00:00:41.340> off<00:00:41.489> of<00:00:41.670> those<00:00:41.790> strong

fashion and submit to the pressure of

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.299 
fashion and submit to the pressure of
the<00:00:48.090> bit<00:00:48.270> we<00:00:49.170> don't<00:00:49.350> want<00:00:49.590> to<00:00:49.680> think<00:00:49.890> of<00:00:50.010> it<00:00:50.160> as

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
the bit we don't want to think of it as

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.670 
the bit we don't want to think of it as
we're<00:00:50.489> trying<00:00:50.730> to<00:00:50.910> bring<00:00:51.750> that<00:00:51.780> horse<00:00:52.230> back<00:00:52.649> in

we're trying to bring that horse back in
the<00:00:53.070> collection<00:00:53.309> and<00:00:53.730> jam<00:00:54.449> them<00:00:54.719> into<00:00:54.989> it<00:00:55.110> we

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
the collection and jam them into it we

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.069 
the collection and jam them into it we
want<00:00:55.500> to<00:00:55.559> think<00:00:55.710> of<00:00:55.860> it<00:00:55.980> as<00:00:56.129> they<00:00:56.309> move<00:00:56.579> forward

00:00:57.069 --> 00:00:57.079 
want to think of it as they move forward

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:01.069 
want to think of it as they move forward
into<00:00:58.079> the<00:00:58.170> bridle<00:00:58.590> even<00:00:59.460> as<00:00:59.609> we<00:00:59.820> stand<00:00:59.879> here<00:01:00.359> we

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
into the bridle even as we stand here we

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.990 
into the bridle even as we stand here we
can<00:01:01.260> learn<00:01:01.410> a<00:01:01.469> lot<00:01:01.739> about<00:01:01.949> this<00:01:02.309> process<00:01:02.820> of

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
can learn a lot about this process of

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.090 
can learn a lot about this process of
collection<00:01:03.449> then<00:01:04.199> we<00:01:04.379> can<00:01:04.559> take<00:01:04.739> it<00:01:04.890> to<00:01:04.920> the

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
collection then we can take it to the

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.010 
collection then we can take it to the
moving<00:01:05.339> forward<00:01:05.790> piece<00:01:06.000> which<00:01:06.540> is<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:06.720> very

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
moving forward piece which is the very

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.480 
moving forward piece which is the very
important<00:01:07.470> part<00:01:07.619> about<00:01:07.799> they<00:01:08.070> move<00:01:08.280> forward

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
important part about they move forward

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.090 
important part about they move forward
into<00:01:08.909> the<00:01:09.030> bridle<00:01:09.479> in<00:01:09.900> order<00:01:10.530> to<00:01:10.619> collect<00:01:10.799> a

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
a horse submits we begin to see him what

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.550 
a horse submits we begin to see him what
we<00:02:04.979> call<00:02:05.189> too<00:02:05.520> softly<00:02:06.030> that's<00:02:06.630> a<00:02:06.869> sign<00:02:07.140> of<00:02:07.409> a

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
we call too softly that's a sign of a

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.430 
we call too softly that's a sign of a

this chewing softly we should feel him
