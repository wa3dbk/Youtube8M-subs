00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:05.330
 Hi, people today, I'm here to show you one. 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:09.450
 new nail tutorial I've done is 

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:11.460
 in fact it is not bazin name and none 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.219
 video I have it there I just did 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:17.620
 because this is already in the head 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:21.380
 Good, I did this is bad here. 

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:27.320
 all this the Chinese technician 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:30.410
 she is a white with blue and she has and 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:32.660
 she has 11 well black is with 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:35.829
 white balls in the part where I 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:39.519
 I made the white part of the nail 

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:41.589
 It's there, I'll tell you more or less 

00:00:39.519 --> 00:00:49.570
 how do you do 

00:00:41.589 --> 00:00:52.119
 First, I used the risquÃ© pen. 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:54.519
 reality this shirt that he knew more 

00:00:52.119 --> 00:00:58.299
 or less how eras I bought this leftover 

00:00:54.519 --> 00:01:00.940
 clean to test me this one is black 

00:00:58.299 --> 00:01:06.260
 it's night black 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:08.880
 I think here it comes calling to you. 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:10.860
 it's night black 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.590
 OK 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.210
 she's about twenty- six 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.790
 real right 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.320
 she has twenty-six reais where I 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:23.700
 I bought it as a one-line 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:26.610
 big and to do for me to be able to do 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:30.300
 the prices 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:33.740
 I used the blue that speaks, that's the 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:33.740
 navy 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:43.060
 that the marina it is an utah overhead 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:46.510
 year in fact I have not 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:49.030
 I have a lot of this brand-name thing , right? 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:50.980
 I used any white, not the white of 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:53.100
 preference you have made a 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:56.140
 specific brand you can use also 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:58.450
 in any brightness I used this here to 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:00.840
 to work tomorrow so he stayed like this 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:02.380
 because I like the colors to appear well 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.890
 huh 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:08.440
 I also have this one that is another 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:10.270
 kind of brightness and this one here does not 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:11.650
 appears very tact you can see that 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:14.310
 He also has no brand because I 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:17.580
 I do not care much for these things either. 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:19.780
 so I used this species 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.730
 You can do other things too. 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:25.090
 if you want the africa of the taste of 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:27.340
 You 're just giving the idea is good. 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:29.440
 first I passed you are you are 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:33.190
 seeing I did two nails 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:37.270
 and the other three did not do it 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:39.430
 these two lines here I passed three 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:41.560
 layers of this subject matter because 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:44.560
 He is very weak and he stays 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:46.980
 failed this passes only one or two hands 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:50.200
 so I spent three to stay the color 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:51.820
 and I passed the white so I passed two hands 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.590
 white because so the bank that like it 

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:55.840
 It's a little thick I spent only two 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:57.610
 that was enough 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.800
 The rest, I'll do with you now. 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:03.680
 OK 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:07.660
 We shake the pen we used to 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:10.160
 lid closed for non're not to leak 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:11.900
 I do not have motor coordination. 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:17.320
 Left hand but it 's just to see. 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:17.320
 for you to see what the Japanese look like 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:24.680
 first on the paper that appears the most 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:24.680
 right here 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:31.270
 You make a friend of 

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:41.830
 It is important for us to leave the 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:45.730
 Dry the enamel because like this pen 

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:50.530
 here she has the very thin tip o you 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:51.910
 Are you seeing how well she has the account? 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:55.170
 thin 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:04:00.810
 if evil is Isaltino has not dry 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:04:00.810
 she she jumps finger ok 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:10.370
 Hi, people like the princess who I think 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.370
 It gets better 

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:24.520
 She does not have to be perfect. 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:24.520
 the boss can see 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.600
 it's just 

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:33.060
 that the treatment is I think this 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:35.939
 it will get better 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:39.530
 Or do you draw a picture or do you 

00:04:35.939 --> 00:04:39.530
 You know how to do it, and I can do it like this. 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:42.979
 I think this way it gets better for me. 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:44.539
 can do 

00:04:42.979 --> 00:04:47.349
 I think it will get better this nail 

00:04:44.539 --> 00:04:51.909
 that good because it never wins yet 

00:04:47.349 --> 00:04:51.909
 I had to spend more than one hand on her 

00:04:57.639 --> 00:05:02.319
 You can do other things if you 

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:04.569
 I wish I could put a rose in a gold 

00:05:02.319 --> 00:05:07.419
 has several pens of various colors but 

00:05:04.569 --> 00:05:10.360
 I prefer black that ahead of us. 

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:15.389
 get well, I'll do these two 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:17.590
 here it's not boring do not leak 

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:19.800
 dense smoke here because the one that stayed 

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:19.800
 smaller 

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:27.100
 the upholsterer there you can pass the 

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:30.190
 brightness 

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:32.530
 you saw that the white one I passed them 

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:35.940
 speak only one nail tip 

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:35.940
 there I have my short 

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:40.650
 I have my short 

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:47.240
 so I guess it's not fulfilled to stay longer 

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:49.780
 beautiful for us to take a little break to 

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:49.780
 stay 

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:56.289
 That's what we do, you can do it. 

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:58.930
 any 

00:05:56.289 --> 00:06:01.509
 to give preference to no excuse is not the 

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:05.909
 glow but the balls in the first two 

00:06:01.509 --> 00:06:05.909
 leads to the famous bubbles but also 

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:14.950
 the edge i do not have to pinch those 

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:17.530
 Dots having what it does it does 

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:19.750
 Pretty does not have this deal, I got it. 

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:22.770
 anything points to me 

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:22.770
 can make the ball 

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:29.889
 We have to do with it, I'll go. 

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:32.280
 to lay on top of this role what 

00:06:29.889 --> 00:06:32.280
 I think it is better 

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:50.319
 He wants to rest a little 

00:06:45.129 --> 00:06:52.389
 close opel I picked a little deal now 

00:06:50.319 --> 00:06:57.899
 Lisinho is on the very thin end for me. 

00:06:52.389 --> 00:06:57.899
 can do only this here 

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:15.740
 if you want to make balls 

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:15.740
 colored is also nice 

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:24.110
 Oh, we hope to get a little bit 

00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:25.880
 not to blink brightly 

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:28.810
 ah I'll spend only for the video not 

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:28.810
 we were fulfilled 

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:44.349
 we like this was 

00:07:40.129 --> 00:07:44.349
 I'll show you the room that looks better. 

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:50.910
 you can vary in your choice 

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:55.290
 So many people, I hope you have 

00:07:50.910 --> 00:07:59.030
 I liked my new line to the 

00:07:55.290 --> 00:07:59.030
 next video kiss, thank you
