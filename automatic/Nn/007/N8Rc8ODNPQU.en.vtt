00:00:24.919 --> 00:00:29.779
 night goes on today's official day 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:31.640
 not in all stores although there 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:33.440
 many users who have launched 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.510
 your digital copies especially for 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:37.760
 check the performance of the game in 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:40.460
 this sense the pc version of the title 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.989
 to form has not been harmed 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:43.789
 some players have reported 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:45.710
 problems when running the game 

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:47.239
 what is the main reason that is what 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.609
 what happens in the main reason 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:52.129
 discontent because it seems that the 

00:00:49.609 --> 00:00:54.829
 frames per second the fps is 

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:56.359
 they default to 30 when you start the 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:58.399
 title to a problem that has already been 

00:00:56.359 --> 00:01:00.379
 in the knowledge of users of 

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:02.570
 user on all the redit forums and 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:05.210
 that can be fixed attentive by changing 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:06.000
 the field value fps is max of the point and 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:08.550
 neither 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.740
 from 30 to 140 according to what has been reported 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:13.380
 that you are seeing on the other screen when 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.210
 file point in and if you modify it jce de 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.330
 such a way as I am seeing the other 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.010
 screen because you can play the title without 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:23.130
 no kind of problems 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:24.690
 maximum not the redit and esteem forums 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.880
 have been the chosen place to put 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:29.310
 demonstrated once again all these 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.320
 incidents that currently affect two 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.720
 Performance categories and files 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.580
 game apparently when you run the 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.130
 title the screen tends to freeze 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:40.950
 the game knots completely when reading 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:43.259
 the archives a solution then good 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.119
 when this happens is that you check the 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:47.520
 cache when downloading the game again 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:50.100
 from steam either completely or by 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.930
 parts md users yet 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.759
 they seem to be the main victims of 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.039
 these problems 

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:58.740
 warner had used the 

00:01:56.039 --> 00:02:01.200
 minimum specifications of the title something 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.539
 it appears that seriously affects 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.940
 its performance that sometimes placed 

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:08.580
 the game at 5 fps is something that 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:11.100
 practically and playable above all 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.300
 when we used the batmobile they accepted 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:15.180
 even cards 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:18.390
 nvidia as powerful as the gtx 980 or 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:20.340
 the 970 including titan x in general 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:22.890
 batman arkham light does not get rid of 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:25.020
 fps crashes I started even using 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:28.170
 the latest drivers located by warner 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:30.630
 a series of problems that the company 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:32.730
 rock steady has said he is taking 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:34.740
 very seriously that you are already aware of 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.720
 all these problems and they ensure that 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:39.690
 all these drawbacks solve what 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.760
 as soon as possible so nothing else you know 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:44.310
 if you want to play the title to the limit already 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:46.650
 you know there you have the file and point in 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:49.350
 and that you can modify you can try and 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:50.580
 you will see how they are limited by saying it 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:52.950
 some way so thank you very much 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:54.360
 everyone for being there like and favorites 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.660
 shared we see you in the next 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.660
 bye
