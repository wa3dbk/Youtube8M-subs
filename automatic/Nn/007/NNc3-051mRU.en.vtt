okay
I'm<00:00:37.020> sure<00:00:37.290> if<00:00:37.350> we're<00:00:37.500> gonna<00:00:37.620> do<00:00:37.800> our<00:00:38.040> core<00:00:38.340> in

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
I'm sure if we're gonna do our core in

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.060 
I'm sure if we're gonna do our core in
the<00:00:38.489> back<00:00:39.200> then<00:00:40.200> of<00:00:40.320> course<00:00:40.590> we<00:00:40.770> have<00:00:40.950> the

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
the back then of course we have the

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:51.459 
the back then of course we have the
galaxy<00:00:41.700> s3

00:00:51.459 --> 00:00:51.469 

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:54.130 

of<00:00:51.829> course<00:00:52.129> the<00:00:52.250> black<00:00:52.489> isn't<00:00:52.730> or<00:00:53.359> the<00:00:53.780> back<00:00:53.960> is

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:54.140 
of course the black isn't or the back is

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:57.459 
of course the black isn't or the back is
back<00:00:54.530> in<00:00:54.739> omega-3<00:00:55.670> synthetic<00:00:56.239> so<00:00:56.449> you<00:00:56.899> easily

00:00:57.459 --> 00:00:57.469 
back in omega-3 synthetic so you easily

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:01.779 
back in omega-3 synthetic so you easily
be<00:00:57.680> able<00:00:57.769> to<00:00:58.190> swap<00:00:58.610> that<00:00:59.620> okay<00:01:00.620> so<00:01:00.760> let's<00:01:01.760> just

00:01:01.779 --> 00:01:01.789 
be able to swap that okay so let's just

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:31.609 
be able to swap that okay so let's just
go<00:01:02.000> ahead<00:01:02.149> and<00:01:02.329> do<00:01:02.510> this<00:01:03.100> like<00:01:04.100> this

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:41.039 

here<00:01:32.619> we<00:01:32.799> go<00:01:35.310> say<00:01:39.030> I'm<00:01:40.030> sure<00:01:40.240> I<00:01:40.270> did<00:01:40.570> extreme

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:41.049 
here we go say I'm sure I did extreme

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:43.560 
here we go say I'm sure I did extreme
over<00:01:41.289> there<00:01:41.470> I<00:01:41.880> think<00:01:42.880> it<00:01:43.180> wasn't<00:01:43.360> that

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:43.570 
over there I think it wasn't that

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:46.440 
over there I think it wasn't that
extreme<00:01:43.990> extreme<00:01:44.880> but<00:01:45.880> I<00:01:45.909> mean<00:01:46.149> you<00:01:46.210> know<00:01:46.240> I

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:46.450 
extreme extreme but I mean you know I

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:49.410 
extreme extreme but I mean you know I
was<00:01:46.570> doing<00:01:46.720> some<00:01:47.640> things<00:01:48.640> like<00:01:48.820> that<00:01:49.030> let's<00:01:49.270> go

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:49.420 
was doing some things like that let's go

00:01:49.420 --> 00:02:39.070 
was doing some things like that let's go
ahead<00:01:49.450> and<00:01:49.780> go<00:01:49.869> to<00:01:53.310> eat

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:39.080 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:41.940 

hmm

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
hmm

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:45.670 
hmm
can<00:02:42.950> you<00:02:43.040> get<00:02:43.160> focus<00:02:44.140> both<00:02:45.140> needs<00:02:45.440> to<00:02:45.560> be

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
can you get focus both needs to be

00:02:45.680 --> 00:04:03.130 
can you get focus both needs to be
handled<00:02:46.100> that's<00:02:46.520> pretty<00:02:46.880> good<00:02:47.030> as<00:02:47.210> well<00:04:02.140> of

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:03.140 
handled that's pretty good as well of

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:06.760 
handled that's pretty good as well of
course<00:04:03.200> this<00:04:03.770> one's<00:04:04.040> running<00:04:04.310> real<00:04:04.700> too<00:04:05.530> so<00:04:06.530> I

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:06.770 
course this one's running real too so I

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:12.900 
course this one's running real too so I
think<00:04:07.070> it<00:04:07.250> should<00:04:07.280> be<00:04:07.580> a<00:04:07.610> little<00:04:07.850> stronger

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:12.910 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:58.379 

let's<00:04:13.910> go<00:04:14.030> ahead<00:04:14.180> and<00:04:14.570> do

00:04:58.379 --> 00:04:58.389 

00:04:58.389 --> 00:05:04.879 

feels<00:04:58.960> pretty<00:04:59.050> durable<00:04:59.500> still<00:05:01.199> come<00:05:02.199> ice

00:05:04.879 --> 00:05:04.889 

00:05:04.889 --> 00:06:06.540 

co-people<00:05:05.889> break<00:05:06.250> these<00:05:06.520> devices<00:05:07.409> yes

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:06.550 

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:09.820 

okay<00:06:07.550> so<00:06:07.850> we<00:06:08.180> need<00:06:08.419> some<00:06:08.600> small<00:06:08.690> knife<00:06:09.410> testing

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:09.830 
okay so we need some small knife testing

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:12.880 
okay so we need some small knife testing
in<00:06:09.919> this<00:06:10.010> video<00:06:11.020> may<00:06:12.020> not<00:06:12.050> be<00:06:12.260> streamed<00:06:12.680> but<00:06:12.860> I

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:12.890 
in this video may not be streamed but I

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:15.700

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:15.710 
think it was hitting it kind of order so

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:18.250 
think it was hitting it kind of order so
song<00:06:15.950> so<00:06:16.640> some<00:06:17.030> quick<00:06:17.150> farmer<00:06:17.630> testing<00:06:18.020> here
