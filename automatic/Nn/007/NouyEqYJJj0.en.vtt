00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:11.969
 hello listeners my dear friends 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:19.160
 and the audience today is finally that summer June 1 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:23.060
 and so we have the sea and the marine theme 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:25.350
 today we make stylish earrings 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:28.800
 starfish 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.840
 and the stars are completely different 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.989
 sizes of different colors 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:38.489
 so we can do that color 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:41.010
 starfish that suits us 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.360
 our clothes or for example bathing 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:47.510
 Kylie sundress 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:50.690
 Well, let's go, I chose two colors 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:54.390
 because I want to disturb it a little 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:59.579
 lighter than this color and i will mix 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:02.160
 white so and while I warm up I will tell 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.789
 you something interesting about the sea 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.600
 stars 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:10.920
 renders so no all starfish yo 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:14.000
 five rays 50 although the most famous 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.880
 starfish rays having 5 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.430
 there are many other types 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.360
 some of them may be up to 40 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.290
 rays 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.290
 imagine 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:30.960
 and now we connect white and pink 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:44.509
 So we got this gleb on 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:47.090
 pink sausage since earrings 2 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:49.520
 so we will share the material exactly 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:52.759
 into 2 equal parts 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.479
 now see why dunk my finger in 

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:56.899
 maslichko 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:57.830
 and slightly handles his work 

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:00.830
 surface 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:06.250
 This is so that the product does not stick 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:06.250
 make such pellets press and 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:27.319
 Now we will divide them into 5 rays 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:30.500
 knife survive to all the legs 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:35.390
 turned out at the end pointy 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:41.180
 now we can take the knife will press and 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:43.329
 do such a structure as you saw on 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.329
 photographs 

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:52.670
 we roll sausage and then we cut 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:55.819
 identical pieces 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:59.720
 See if you cut leave on 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:03:05.030
 knife blades do not work out the same 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:10.850
 sizes now in kata balls it to us 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:15.040
 nothing new now these balls 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:15.040
 him with a kind of needle so hand 

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:26.930
 placed on the rays and in the middle 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:28.989
 so a little more then we take 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:34.659
 it's so computer 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:34.659
 corner wand after all and to make 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:49.160
 here we got such a wonderful 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:49.160
 starfish 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:56.480
 now we have to do the exact same 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:56.480
 for the second earring 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:06.890
 It turned out two such sea carried 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:09.630
 remember we cut 4 pieces it will 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:12.900
 additional stars but a little 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:15.900
 smaller if you find it difficult to cut yourself 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:18.299
 draw an asterisk on a piece of paper and how 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:21.060
 stencil attach clay 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:24.000
 and then it will be easier to cut 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:27.570
 rays and then we got such two 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:30.560
 large and four small sea 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:33.830
 I was a little small sprocket shaft until 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:35.010
 Needle now remains to make us 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:38.700
 pins 

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:42.060
 that is, such loops for which your 

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:44.850
 products will be fastened since I 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:46.760
 very thin and the product so i will 

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:50.840
 use 

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:53.560
 wire pins take an asterisk 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:55.110
 we insert 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:05:02.099
 pin 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:05:02.099
 lightly hold in one of the rays 

00:05:02.129 --> 00:05:08.939
 I do this to every friend like this 

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:10.099
 we have two sets of three 

00:05:08.939 --> 00:05:14.119
 asterisks 

00:05:10.099 --> 00:05:17.279

00:05:14.119 --> 00:05:21.629

00:05:17.279 --> 00:05:26.219

00:05:31.649 --> 00:05:38.699
 we need to collect them so tender 

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:44.099
 earrings will need pliers or 

00:05:38.699 --> 00:05:47.629
 we take a couple of five pliers 

00:05:44.099 --> 00:05:47.629
 here are the little rings 

00:05:48.259 --> 00:05:56.389
