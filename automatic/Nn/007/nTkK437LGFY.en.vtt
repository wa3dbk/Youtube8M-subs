mean a dream is just a dream once you
wake<00:00:38.220> up<00:00:38.280> right<00:00:39.410> which<00:00:40.410> means<00:00:40.790> we'll<00:00:41.790> all

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
wake up right which means we'll all

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.280 
wake up right which means we'll all
forget<00:00:42.270> about<00:00:42.570> everything<00:00:42.989> that<00:00:43.260> happened

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
forget about everything that happened

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.820

here<00:00:44.660> just<00:00:45.660> as<00:00:45.810> you<00:00:45.930> might<00:00:46.110> remember<00:00:46.260> a<00:00:46.590> dream

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:46.830 
here just as you might remember a dream

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:49.430 
here just as you might remember a dream
upon<00:00:47.310> waking<00:00:47.540> some<00:00:48.540> memories<00:00:48.960> may<00:00:49.170> still

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
upon waking some memories may still

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.090 
upon waking some memories may still
remain<00:00:50.030> but<00:00:51.030> also<00:00:51.239> like<00:00:51.629> a<00:00:51.660> dream<00:00:52.070> sooner<00:00:53.070> or

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
remain but also like a dream sooner or

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.260 
remain but also like a dream sooner or
later<00:00:53.250> the<00:00:53.790> dream<00:00:54.090> is<00:00:54.300> destined<00:00:54.809> to<00:00:54.900> fade<00:00:55.230> I

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:56.270 
later the dream is destined to fade I

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:04.400 
later the dream is destined to fade I
don't<00:00:57.270> like<00:00:57.720> that<00:00:59.900> what<00:01:00.900> happens<00:01:03.140> if<00:01:04.140> the

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:04.410 
don't like that what happens if the

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:06.890 
don't like that what happens if the
world<00:01:04.680> disappears<00:01:05.369> anything<00:01:06.210> created<00:01:06.690> here

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
world disappears anything created here

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.010 
world disappears anything created here
would<00:01:07.050> have<00:01:07.170> to<00:01:07.320> disappear<00:01:07.740> to<00:01:08.009> I<00:01:09.020> guess

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
would have to disappear to I guess

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.350 
would have to disappear to I guess
that's<00:01:10.290> just<00:01:10.440> the<00:01:10.619> way<00:01:10.830> it<00:01:10.979> is<00:01:11.009> it's<00:01:12.000> not<00:01:12.149> like

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
that's just the way it is it's not like

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.260 
that's just the way it is it's not like
we<00:01:12.479> really<00:01:12.690> existed<00:01:13.170> in<00:01:13.259> the<00:01:13.290> first<00:01:13.350> place<00:01:14.270> if

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
we really existed in the first place if

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.630 
we really existed in the first place if
that's<00:01:15.630> our<00:01:15.840> faith<00:01:16.229> we<00:01:16.470> have<00:01:16.500> no<00:01:16.830> choice<00:01:17.220> but

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
that's our faith we have no choice but

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:25.960 
that's our faith we have no choice but
to<00:01:17.820> accept<00:01:18.270> it<00:01:21.979> I'm<00:01:22.979> not<00:01:23.160> gonna<00:01:23.369> die<00:01:23.640> am<00:01:23.970> I

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:25.970
