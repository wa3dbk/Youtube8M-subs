another one so for this one I actually
just<00:02:27.930> used<00:02:28.200> the<00:02:28.409> quote<00:02:28.620> maybe<00:02:29.040> okay<00:02:29.459> will<00:02:29.489> be

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
just used the quote maybe okay will be

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.879 
just used the quote maybe okay will be
our<00:02:29.849> always<00:02:30.389> and<00:02:30.870> if<00:02:31.439> you<00:02:31.560> don't<00:02:31.709> know<00:02:31.799> what
