video<00:00:01.979> comparison<00:00:02.669> here<00:00:02.850> between<00:00:02.879> galaxy's

00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:03.689 
video comparison here between galaxy's

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:06.769 
video comparison here between galaxy's
two<00:00:03.840> plus<00:00:04.140> and<00:00:04.440> the<00:00:04.710> iPhone<00:00:05.069> 5<00:00:05.310> here<00:00:05.940> I<00:00:06.330> found

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:06.779 
two plus and the iPhone 5 here I found

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:08.419 
two plus and the iPhone 5 here I found
that<00:00:06.990> you<00:00:07.170> of<00:00:07.230> course<00:00:07.259> can<00:00:07.680> pick<00:00:07.859> up<00:00:08.010> four<00:00:08.309> on

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429 
that you of course can pick up four on

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.110 
that you of course can pick up four on
five<00:00:08.940> hundred<00:00:09.570> pounds<00:00:10.230> at<00:00:10.410> the<00:00:10.440> moment<00:00:11.010> and<00:00:11.250> of

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
five hundred pounds at the moment and of

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:13.910 
five hundred pounds at the moment and of
course<00:00:12.389> the<00:00:12.570> galaxies<00:00:12.990> to<00:00:13.110> toast<00:00:13.440> it<00:00:13.590> you<00:00:13.740> can

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
course the galaxies to toast it you can

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.330 
course the galaxies to toast it you can
get<00:00:14.340> four<00:00:14.700> on<00:00:14.880> three<00:00:15.269> hundred<00:00:15.719> pounds<00:00:16.199> so<00:00:16.379> you

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
get four on three hundred pounds so you

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.849 
get four on three hundred pounds so you
start<00:00:17.880> off<00:00:17.910> with<00:00:17.970> the<00:00:18.150> processor<00:00:18.690> here<00:00:19.109> and

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
start off with the processor here and

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:21.410 
start off with the processor here and
the<00:00:20.189> phone<00:00:20.340> that<00:00:20.520> came<00:00:20.640> first<00:00:20.820> of<00:00:21.029> course<00:00:21.210> was

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
the phone that came first of course was

us<00:01:03.030> of<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:03.750> original<00:01:04.260> galaxies<00:01:04.890> too<00:01:05.100> but<00:01:05.670> it

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
us of the original galaxies too but it

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.609 
us of the original galaxies too but it
comes<00:01:06.000> in<00:01:06.180> different<00:01:06.210> coloring<00:01:06.960> as<00:01:07.140> this<00:01:07.380> kind

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
comes in different coloring as this kind

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.219 
comes in different coloring as this kind
