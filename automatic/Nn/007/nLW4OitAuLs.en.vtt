00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
eyeshadow and eyeliner on it's just a

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:31.429 
eyeshadow and eyeliner on it's just a
mess<00:00:24.500> so<00:00:25.500> I<00:00:26.240> usually<00:00:27.410> use<00:00:29.300> something<00:00:30.439> cheaper

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
mess so I usually use something cheaper

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.100 
mess so I usually use something cheaper
because<00:00:31.650> in<00:00:32.369> my<00:00:32.640> opinion<00:00:32.790> all<00:00:33.239> mascara<00:00:33.780> is<00:00:33.899> the

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
because in my opinion all mascara is the

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.290 
because in my opinion all mascara is the
same<00:00:34.410> the<00:00:34.440> expensive<00:00:35.370> stuff<00:00:35.489> the<00:00:35.850> cheap<00:00:36.120> stuff

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
same the expensive stuff the cheap stuff

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.920 
same the expensive stuff the cheap stuff
it's<00:00:36.660> all<00:00:36.930> the<00:00:37.530> same<00:00:37.710> formula<00:00:38.340> right<00:00:39.469> so

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:41.930 
it's all the same formula right so

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:47.180 
it's all the same formula right so
usually<00:00:44.360> go<00:00:45.360> from<00:00:45.539> root<00:00:45.809> to<00:00:45.840> tip<00:00:46.050> into<00:00:47.039> what<00:00:47.160> I

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
usually go from root to tip into what I

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:58.610 
usually go from root to tip into what I
do<00:00:47.399> i<00:00:51.020> send<00:00:52.020> them<00:00:52.170> through<00:00:52.410> the<00:00:52.530> bottom<00:00:57.620> making

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
do i send them through the bottom making

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:08.570 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:14.270 

spider<00:01:09.570> lashes<00:01:10.230> are<00:01:10.640> when<00:01:11.640> girls<00:01:13.130> curl<00:01:14.130> their

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.940 
and they kind of look like spiders to me

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
sure that the clumping doesn't happen

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.520 
sure that the clumping doesn't happen
that<00:01:36.060> usually<00:01:36.210> happens<00:01:36.840> when<00:01:36.900> you<00:01:37.110> put<00:01:37.320> way

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530

too<00:01:37.560> much<00:01:37.770> mascara<00:01:38.460> on<00:01:39.050> and<00:01:40.340> that's<00:01:41.340> what<00:01:41.580> I

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
too much mascara on and that's what I

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.170 
too much mascara on and that's what I
always<00:01:41.700> try<00:01:42.210> to<00:01:42.240> avoid<00:01:43.369> then<00:01:44.369> another<00:01:44.820> thing

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
always try to avoid then another thing

always try to avoid then another thing
you<00:01:45.840> should<00:01:45.869> probably<00:01:46.560> not<00:01:46.710> do<00:01:47.040> is<00:01:47.369> curl<00:01:48.210> your

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:48.330 
you should probably not do is curl your

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.830 
you should probably not do is curl your
eyelashes<00:01:49.880> curling<00:01:50.880> them<00:01:50.970> too<00:01:51.240> much<00:01:51.420> allows

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
eyelashes curling them too much allows

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.719 
eyelashes curling them too much allows
your<00:01:52.050> eyelashes<00:01:52.590> to<00:01:52.770> look<00:01:52.950> like<00:01:53.550> they're

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
your eyelashes to look like they're

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.060 
your eyelashes to look like they're
going<00:01:53.880> straight<00:01:54.420> up<00:01:54.630> and<00:01:54.930> there's<00:01:55.110> no<00:01:55.170> really

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
going straight up and there's no really

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.200 
going straight up and there's no really
curl<00:01:56.880> to<00:01:57.270> them<00:01:57.590> in<00:01:58.590> my<00:01:58.920> opinion<00:01:59.340> spending<00:02:00.119> a

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
curl to them in my opinion spending a

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.560 
curl to them in my opinion spending a
lot<00:02:00.360> of<00:02:00.390> money<00:02:00.690> on<00:02:00.780> mascaras<00:02:01.880> not<00:02:02.880> necessary

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
lot of money on mascaras not necessary

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.940 
lot of money on mascaras not necessary
because<00:02:04.100> in<00:02:05.100> my<00:02:05.580> opinion<00:02:05.790> I<00:02:06.360> think<00:02:06.390> all

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950 
because in my opinion I think all

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.100 
because in my opinion I think all
mascaras<00:02:07.950> pretty<00:02:08.790> much<00:02:08.970> the<00:02:09.119> same<00:02:09.330> formula

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
mascaras pretty much the same formula

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.610 
mascaras pretty much the same formula
and<00:02:11.090> it's<00:02:12.090> just<00:02:12.390> in<00:02:12.540> a<00:02:12.660> different<00:02:12.840> bottle<00:02:13.440> when

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
and it's just in a different bottle when

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.610 
and it's just in a different bottle when
you<00:02:13.739> get<00:02:13.950> it<00:02:14.100> expensive<00:02:15.030> the<00:02:15.989> mascara<00:02:16.440> eyes

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
you get it expensive the mascara eyes

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:22.940 
you get it expensive the mascara eyes
use<00:02:17.010> is<00:02:17.810> l'oreal<00:02:18.810> voluminous<00:02:19.790> and<00:02:21.950> it

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
use is l'oreal voluminous and it

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.310 
use is l'oreal voluminous and it
probably<00:02:23.220> cost<00:02:23.640> about<00:02:23.760> six<00:02:24.660> or<00:02:24.780> seven<00:02:24.930> bucks

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 
probably cost about six or seven bucks

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:30.940 
probably cost about six or seven bucks
at<00:02:26.060> Walgreens<00:02:27.060> or<00:02:27.450> CVS<00:02:28.549> pretty<00:02:29.549> much<00:02:29.730> anywhere
