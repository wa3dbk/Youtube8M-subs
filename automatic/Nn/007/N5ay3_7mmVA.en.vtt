00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.179 
know what else I can do to be honest
because<00:01:50.880> I'm<00:01:51.390> just<00:01:52.079> following<00:01:52.560> into<00:01:52.920> binds

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
because I'm just following into binds

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.340 
because I'm just following into binds
because<00:01:53.790> if<00:01:54.030> you<00:01:54.180> go<00:01:54.329> actually<00:01:54.540> searching<00:01:55.200> for

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
because if you go actually searching for

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.770 
because if you go actually searching for
all<00:01:55.409> your<00:01:55.590> folders<00:01:56.009> and<00:01:56.189> stuff<00:01:56.310> in<00:01:56.729> there<00:01:57.570> go

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
all your folders and stuff in there go

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.130 
all your folders and stuff in there go
main<00:01:58.079> players<00:01:58.799> PB<00:01:59.670> and<00:02:00.210> then<00:02:00.689> it<00:02:00.840> will<00:02:00.960> say

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
main players PB and then it will say

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.950 
main players PB and then it will say
config<00:02:01.979> clicking<00:02:02.579> that<00:02:02.729> it<00:02:02.880> tells<00:02:03.119> you<00:02:03.390> all<00:02:03.600> of

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
config clicking that it tells you all of

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.950 
config clicking that it tells you all of
the<00:02:04.140> bind<00:02:04.409> series<00:02:05.210> when<00:02:06.210> you<00:02:06.299> scroll<00:02:06.540> down<00:02:06.600> you

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
the bind series when you scroll down you

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.749 
the bind series when you scroll down you
can<00:02:07.020> see<00:02:07.140> the<00:02:07.380> name<00:02:07.560> of<00:02:07.590> your<00:02:07.740> classes

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
can see the name of your classes

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.999 
can see the name of your classes
it<00:02:09.179> tells<00:02:09.479> you<00:02:09.689> absolutely<00:02:10.080> everything<00:02:10.619> so<00:02:10.799> I

it tells you absolutely everything so I
just<00:02:11.280> wanted<00:02:11.489> to<00:02:11.580> look<00:02:11.670> for<00:02:11.909> there<00:02:12.120> and<00:02:12.720> I<00:02:13.650> just

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
just wanted to look for there and I just

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.240 
just wanted to look for there and I just
found<00:02:14.129> HUD<00:02:14.760> and<00:02:15.030> it<00:02:15.720> says<00:02:15.930> zero<00:02:16.260> on<00:02:16.500> it<00:02:16.680> so<00:02:17.159> now

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250
