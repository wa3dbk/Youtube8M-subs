00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:09.310
Jeans used to be something that you really
had to wear casually and, you know, they were

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:12.000
a faux pas to wear at the office or maybe
to a nice restaurant.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.660
And that's really not true anymore.

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:17.190
I think jeans have become a staple and they
can look as classic and as elegant as you

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.170
want them to.

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:20.440
You know, there's a huge variety.

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:22.270
Let's go through the sort of types of jeans.

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:26.351
I think the most popular pair that you see
most often and sort of on the runways and

00:00:26.351 --> 00:00:32.140
in magazines and on the streets are just a
slim cut, you know a quote, unquote skinny

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:33.140
jean.

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:37.430
Typically those are best in a dark denim,
a black or a dark blue, just because they're

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:40.870
cut so slender to the leg that it's always
more flattering if you do it in the darker

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:41.870
color.

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:46.370
You have the classic boot cut, which is, just
means fitted through the thighs, slightly

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:49.410
flared through the calf and ankle.

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.720
A little bit of 70's is making it's way back
into the fashion scene now, so sometimes you'll

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:59.120
see a higher wasted or a bootleg, or a, you
know, a really flared jean.

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:00.880
Those are another option.

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:05.280
I think what the best thing to do is to go
to a store and try on all the different ones.

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.290
It's not about what's most flattering, but
what you're most comfortable in.

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:12.360
I don't think there's a rule as to what body
type can wear skinny jeans, or what body type

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.790
can wear flared jeans.

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:17.350
I think it's about finding what you're going
to feel best in, and at the end of the day

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:19.200
that's all that matters.

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.310
So when it comes to shopping for jeans.

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:23.229
You want to make sure that they fit.

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:26.790
And there's a difference between really tight
jeans and too tight jeans.

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.080
They should fit nicely.

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.170
They shouldn't bunch.

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:33.700
They shouldn't be sort of digging in, and
you shouldn't see sort of rolls in the fabric.

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:34.700
And this isn't about size.

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.851
It's doesn't mean, you know, you have to be
a certain size for that to happen.

00:01:37.851 --> 00:01:38.990
It's about the quality of the denim.

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:43.310
So you always want to find a good mix between
denim and stretch.

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:44.729
You know a jegging is great.

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:49.030
I think that the problem with the jegging,
again, is sometimes you get that rolling or

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:53.470
that sort of the pinching, and you want to
avoid that in terms of making your jeans sort

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:58.770
of look as high quality and as expensive as
you want them to, even if you didn't spend

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.590
much money on them.

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.400
Some of my favorite high end brands are J
Brand.

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:09.170
I think that they do a great job of providing
a bunch of different fits and styles for many

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:10.539
different body types.

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:14.200
So they have the same pair of skinny jeans
with three different waist levels.

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.650
That means if you like a lower waist, then
you can have those.

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.880
If you like a higher waist, then there's that
option as well, instead of being sort of stuck

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.599
into one specific fit.

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:24.510
And they have that through all their variety.

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.930
So their bootleg, their flares.

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:28.780
They have several different cuts of skinny
jeans.

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:33.600
I think if you want to spend a quality amount
of money on a pair of jeans, the best way

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:37.060
to do it is to make sure they're going to
fit and you have the right options.

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:41.410
On the cheaper level, or the less expensive
version, you know, Urban Outfitters, their

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:42.910
BDG line is great.

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:44.690
They're $50 or less.

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:48.660
They're incredibly flattering and they always
come in a bunch of rainbow of colors, which

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.599
is so nice if you want to play around with
your jeans and not look like you're wearing

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:52.659
the same pair all the time.
