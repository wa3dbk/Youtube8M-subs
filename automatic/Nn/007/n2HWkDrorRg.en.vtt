00:00:04.679 --> 00:00:08.914
 We are in San Francisco and we are seeing the portrait of Frida Kahlos 

00:00:08.914 --> 00:00:13.100
 Frida and Diego Rivera of 1931. 

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:15.497
 So it's an early work of Frida Kahlos 

00:00:15.497 --> 00:00:19.946
 and both were in San Francisco, so it's a wonderful place to see this painting. 

00:00:19.946 --> 00:00:24.115
 And they were here, because Rivera was committed to painting these murals. 

00:00:24.115 --> 00:00:30.918
 He was already a great painter, who was known in Mexico and was invited to the United States. 

00:00:30.918 --> 00:00:37.497
 He was on the verge of a personal exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, 

00:00:37.497 --> 00:00:41.907
 and I think it was just the second personal exhibition that the museum had held. 

00:00:41.907 --> 00:00:43.214
 Exactly. The first was Matisse. 

00:00:43.214 --> 00:00:45.363
 And this is an extraordinary circle. 

00:00:45.363 --> 00:00:51.264
 Andy Rockefeller was involved in the founding of the Museum of Modern Art, 

00:00:51.264 --> 00:00:54.345
 he wanted Pikaso and Matisse to create a huge wall in the lobby. 

00:00:54.345 --> 00:00:59.456
 Those both fell from the proposal, but Rivera was the third choice, so it's extraordinary. 

00:00:59.456 --> 00:01:03.097
 This is not the work of Riveras, it's Fridas. 

00:01:03.097 --> 00:01:07.990
 It looks so small and diminished next to it, and so subtle. 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:12.032
 And I'm somewhat impressed with the way she bends and looks at us, 

00:01:12.032 --> 00:01:15.282
 as he looks very rigid and looks right at us. 

00:01:15.282 --> 00:01:17.720
 The way she has described it, has looked at it, 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.102
 offering us as a very durable figure. 

00:01:21.102 --> 00:01:24.457
 And she stands in a different way from him, right? 

00:01:24.457 --> 00:01:27.973
 He is so determined, his ankles are so strong 

00:01:27.973 --> 00:01:33.841
 and there is something about how her dress does not touch the ground, which gives it some kind of relief 

00:01:33.841 --> 00:01:36.131
 and also the thrust of her head. 

00:01:36.131 --> 00:01:43.474
 Yes, there are curved shapes in that scarf she holds, and on her neck, headband, and curves 

00:01:43.474 --> 00:01:49.281
 of dress. So she has this feminine form, which looks really different 

00:01:49.281 --> 00:01:50.637
 from his rigid attitude. 

00:01:50.637 --> 00:01:54.297
 And there are many symbolic in what they are talking about in their clothes. 

00:01:54.297 --> 00:02:00.640
 So it is referring to its Mexican heritage, folk culture 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:05.906
 and is really trying to revive and give her a point of her pride and the importance of this inheritance. 

00:02:05.906 --> 00:02:09.818
 The portrait of both. The way they have this pale background, 

00:02:09.818 --> 00:02:14.321
 also comes from the artistic tradition of Mexican colonies. 

00:02:14.321 --> 00:02:18.340
 Dieg here is presented with his work shirt under suit, 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:22.324
 which is very interesting because it shows a working class sign, 

00:02:22.324 --> 00:02:24.631
 but also a kind of seriousness. 

00:02:24.631 --> 00:02:30.338
 And his tradition, by the 1920s Mexico mural painters, 

00:02:30.338 --> 00:02:35.157
 who were trying to build an artistic tradition through the Mexican Revolution 

00:02:35.157 --> 00:02:37.582
 of art creation for people. 

00:02:37.582 --> 00:02:39.489
 He is described as a worker. 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:42.275
 I'm also impressed by their hands. 

00:02:42.275 --> 00:02:44.573
 Her hand is somewhat light on her. 

00:02:44.573 --> 00:02:47.774
 It seems to me that she is leaving. it's interesting that he does 

00:02:47.774 --> 00:02:51.337
 paint brushes and palette, while this is her painting. 

00:02:51.337 --> 00:02:57.140
 She almost does not let go and she looks at us. It seems to me that she is developing her independence. 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:02.607
 Diego is strong and is not moving, he has his hand open to him. 

00:03:02.607 --> 00:03:06.038
 But she has a shaky head and has a little movement. 

00:03:06.038 --> 00:03:10.683
 It is the one that takes the hand, raises our heads and looks at us. 

00:03:10.683 --> 00:03:14.485
 And if you look at the bird in the top, he's flying with a banner. 

00:03:14.485 --> 00:03:18.542
 Just as the museum translates it into English, it says: 

00:03:18.542 --> 00:03:24.697
 Here you see me, Frisa Kahlo with my friend Diego Rivera. 

00:03:24.697 --> 00:03:31.135
 I painted these portraits in this beautiful city, San Francisco, for our friend 

00:03:31.135 --> 00:03:33.898
 Mr. Aver Bender, who was the manager of the museum where we are staying. 

00:03:33.898 --> 00:03:37.140
 It was April of 1931.
