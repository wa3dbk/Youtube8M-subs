jets dome has gone missing and then

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.700 
jets dome has gone missing and then
spring<00:00:14.730> load<00:00:14.969> and<00:00:15.210> quillfire<00:00:15.690> get<00:00:16.109> out<00:00:16.320> of<00:00:16.500> the

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
spring load and quillfire get out of the

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.400 
spring load and quillfire get out of the
port<00:00:17.369> and<00:00:17.760> then<00:00:17.940> they<00:00:18.270> go<00:00:18.480> making<00:00:18.960> a<00:00:19.020> ramp<00:00:19.230> it
