00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.890 
but what about just rook after while
I've<00:03:11.850> got<00:03:11.880> the<00:03:12.000> same<00:03:12.210> out<00:03:12.360> an<00:03:12.450> f<00:03:12.570> file<00:03:14.900> so

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
I've got the same out an f file so

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:20.710 
I've got the same out an f file so
that's<00:03:16.080> annoying<00:03:16.380> pressure<00:03:16.680> just<00:03:17.160> work<00:03:17.370> f1

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:20.720 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:23.000 

suppose<00:03:21.720> he's<00:03:21.900> got<00:03:22.080> potential<00:03:22.350> for<00:03:22.590> nights<00:03:22.770> he

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
suppose he's got potential for nights he

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:28.480 
suppose he's got potential for nights he
freeze<00:03:23.340> if<00:03:23.580> I<00:03:23.670> taking<00:03:24.120> it<00:03:24.240> as<00:03:24.480> a<00:03:24.510> pawn<00:03:24.810> there<00:03:25.640> um

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:28.490 
freeze if I taking it as a pawn there um

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:31.250 
freeze if I taking it as a pawn there um
maybe<00:03:29.490> I<00:03:29.640> can<00:03:29.790> just<00:03:29.820> take<00:03:30.150> the<00:03:30.180> night<00:03:30.510> take<00:03:30.990> and

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
maybe I can just take the night take and

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.800 
maybe I can just take the night take and
just<00:03:31.410> let<00:03:31.530> me<00:03:31.620> take<00:03:31.770> on<00:03:31.950> be<00:03:32.130> too<00:03:32.510> so<00:03:33.510> in<00:03:33.630> game

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
just let me take on be too so in game

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:39.880 
just let me take on be too so in game
time<00:03:34.080> for<00:03:34.290> the<00:03:34.350> attack<00:03:34.620> with<00:03:35.520> like<00:03:35.760> rook<00:03:35.940> f<00:03:36.120> 1

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:39.890 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:43.970 

i've<00:03:40.890> gone<00:03:41.070> back<00:03:41.870> and<00:03:42.870> bring<00:03:43.320> this<00:03:43.590> light<00:03:43.830> to

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
i've gone back and bring this light to

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:50.290 
i've gone back and bring this light to
g5<00:03:44.400> now<00:03:44.670> maybe<00:03:44.910> I<00:03:46.520> think<00:03:47.520> I'll<00:03:47.640> do<00:03:47.790> that

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:50.300 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:57.740 

seems<00:03:51.300> to<00:03:51.390> be<00:03:51.480> wasting<00:03:51.840> that<00:03:51.959> time<00:03:52.260> there

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750
