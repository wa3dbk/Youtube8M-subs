00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:10.539
 if I have a space that suddenly 

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:12.940
 They give an impressive desire to go 

00:00:10.539 --> 00:00:15.339
 purchases and I can not deny that go 

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:18.700
 shopping is one of our biggest 

00:00:15.339 --> 00:00:22.690
 weaknesses however many times the 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:24.370
 insanity can invade us and instead of that 

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:26.980
 go shopping and an experience 

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:30.130
 nice can become a 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:33.420
 nightmare so that this does not get you 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:33.420
 I have here 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:41.560
 your closet give a little check in your closet 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:43.540
 preferably clean it accommodates your clothes 

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:46.329
 this is going to help you see what the 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:49.300
 clothes that you need most I already know that 

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:51.340
 we need all of them but you may 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:53.290
 notice that there are colors or garments that are 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:55.570
 very similar you can also see which 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:58.300
 are the clothes that you are missing you are going to 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:00.790
 also serve for you to check which 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:03.309
 are those that no longer want or that you no longer 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:06.040
 is another thing super important is that 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:07.900
 You will surely find that blouse 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.970
 the losses or you'll see that again 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:12.460
 dress that you also see but that 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:14.920
 It's been a long time since you go back and remember that 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:17.260
 God is a god of order so when 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:20.680
 go shopping do it with order not only 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:23.080
 for emotion take a notebook and make one 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:25.240
 list with those things that you need and 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:27.360
 those that you would like to buy for 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:29.979
 mere taste 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.140
 check your budget and what it is that 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:34.630
 you have with how much budget stories 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:37.450
 this is going to help you focus no longer 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:41.380
 spend more avoid thinking about 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:46.450
 get into debt if you have one of these or this 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:48.430
 or this or these do not use them we know that 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:51.250
 it is a pleasure and a very pleasant moment 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:53.710
 go shopping but that pleasant moment 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:55.810
 it can end the moment you see 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:57.880
 your account statement so remember that 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:00.009
 they also gave us a spirit of 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.810
 self-control so as a whole 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:03.850
 princess that you are do not let the 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:07.020
 emotion for shopping come out of your 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:07.020
 hands and your budget 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:13.430
 never buy something without trying it 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:16.370
 nothing happens that does not prove you worth a thousand 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:18.140
 things even if you leave the store with nothing 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:20.540
 in this way you will be able to be sure of 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:22.340
 your purchase and when you are in the fitting room 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.980
 make sure it 's a garment that 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:27.620
 you need can be combined with other 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:31.310
 things in your wardrobe if you have nothing 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:34.520
 with which to combine it you do not buy it you have 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:37.400
 that look for reasons to buy it not what 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:39.739
 Buy guide yourself by your first instinct and 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:42.350
 by how you fit according to your body 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:43.280
 You must feel safe and calm with your 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:45.890
 decision 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:48.560
 Try even those things that you thought that 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:50.660
 it would never cost those colors yet 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:54.130
 you like me very much, believe me you could 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:54.130
 bring you some very pleasant surprises 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:03:01.640
 you buy me alone 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:03.650
 I already know that to go shopping we like it 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:06.980
 go with the friends with the mom with the 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:09.800
 sisters with boyfriend and so on and he's 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:12.140
 listening to the opinion of all of me at 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:16.580
 final remember that the clothes you are going to use 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:19.400
 you do listen to the opinions but you 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:22.700
 be the one to decide whether or not to make the purchase 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:25.400
 if you do not convince yourself then do not do it 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:27.440
 even though they tell you yes and 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:30.260
 if you convince you even though they 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:33.340
 say that not at the end you are the one 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.340
 make the decision 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:41.560
 focus on your reality we all dream 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:44.290

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:50.140
 all very glamorous to the 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:51.880
 vanguard but in our reality is 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:54.250
 as it is always functional 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:56.530
 we have to look for clothes that 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:59.410

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:01.420
