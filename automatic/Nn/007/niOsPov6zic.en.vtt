in the given radical expression to
rationalize<00:00:09.210> the<00:00:09.450> denominator<00:00:10.050> is<00:00:10.670> to

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
rationalize the denominator is to

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.299 
rationalize the denominator is to
rewrite<00:00:12.450> the<00:00:12.690> radical<00:00:12.840> expression<00:00:13.769> as<00:00:13.920> an

radicals<00:00:21.350> so<00:00:22.350> in<00:00:22.439> the<00:00:22.529> given<00:00:22.800> problem<00:00:23.100> to

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
radicals so in the given problem to

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.349 
radicals so in the given problem to
remove<00:00:24.180> the<00:00:24.390> radical<00:00:24.960> from<00:00:25.470> the<00:00:25.529> denominator

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:26.359 
remove the radical from the denominator

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:30.320 
remove the radical from the denominator
we<00:00:27.359> have<00:00:27.390> to<00:00:27.689> see<00:00:28.369> what<00:00:29.369> we<00:00:29.550> need<00:00:29.699> to<00:00:29.849> multiply

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
we have to see what we need to multiply

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.270 
we have to see what we need to multiply
the<00:00:30.390> denominator<00:00:30.570> by<00:00:32.030> obviously<00:00:33.800> the<00:00:34.800> index

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
the denominator by obviously the index

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.560 
the denominator by obviously the index
is<00:00:35.460> 3<00:00:35.820> and<00:00:36.360> so<00:00:37.190> we<00:00:38.190> multiply<00:00:38.700> by<00:00:38.850> another<00:00:39.000> cube

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
is 3 and so we multiply by another cube

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:45.910 
is 3 and so we multiply by another cube

00:01:21.889 --> 00:01:21.899 
one more two and two more wise so we

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:30.529 
one more two and two more wise so we
take<00:01:22.170> one<00:01:22.560> more<00:01:22.590> two<00:01:23.100> and<00:01:24.050> two<00:01:25.050> more<00:01:25.380> wise<00:01:29.539> now

in order to keep the given expression

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.790 
in order to keep the given expression
just<00:01:34.860> the<00:01:35.009> same<00:01:36.259> what<00:01:37.259> we<00:01:37.410> do<00:01:37.560> to<00:01:37.710> the

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:37.800 
just the same what we do to the

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.200 
just the same what we do to the
denominator<00:01:38.520> we<00:01:38.670> should<00:01:38.850> do<00:01:38.970> to<00:01:39.119> the

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
denominator we should do to the

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.930 
denominator we should do to the
numerator<00:01:39.390> two<00:01:40.080> all<00:01:40.229> also<00:01:40.800> so<00:01:41.580> we<00:01:41.729> multiply

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:41.940 
numerator two all also so we multiply

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:45.320 
numerator two all also so we multiply
the<00:01:42.300> numerator<00:01:42.780> also<00:01:43.050> by<00:01:43.560> that<00:01:43.860> cube<00:01:44.220> root<00:01:44.490> two

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:45.330 
the numerator also by that cube root two

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:50.960 
the numerator also by that cube root two
times<00:01:45.360> y<00:01:46.289> times<00:01:46.530> one

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
that now becomes cube root of x squared

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:08.359 
that now becomes cube root of x squared
x<00:01:59.750> -<00:02:00.750> y<00:02:01.560> square<00:02:02.930> divided<00:02:03.930> by<00:02:04.550> cube<00:02:05.550> root<00:02:05.820> of<00:02:07.369> 4

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
times 2 is 8 and Y times y times y would

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:20.990 
times 2 is 8 and Y times y times y would
be<00:02:15.810> Y<00:02:16.590> cubed<00:02:18.740> so<00:02:19.740> the<00:02:20.340> given<00:02:20.670> radical

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000

the<00:02:34.260> denominator<00:02:36.080> it<00:02:37.080> is<00:02:37.140> cube<00:02:37.650> root<00:02:37.680> of<00:02:38.160> 8

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:38.990 
the denominator it is cube root of 8

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:44.750 
the denominator it is cube root of 8
times<00:02:39.990> y<00:02:40.290> cubed<00:02:41.720> which<00:02:42.720> can<00:02:42.959> be<00:02:43.310> cube<00:02:44.310> root<00:02:44.580> of

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
8 is a perfect cube of 2 so cube root of

8 is a perfect cube of 2 so cube root of
2<00:02:56.489> cubed<00:02:57.200> would<00:02:58.200> give<00:02:58.530> just<00:02:59.180> 2<00:03:00.180> outside<00:03:00.750> and

2 cubed would give just 2 outside and

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:07.190 
2 cubed would give just 2 outside and
same<00:03:02.519> way<00:03:02.760> cube<00:03:03.660> root<00:03:03.870> of<00:03:03.989> Y<00:03:04.320> cubed<00:03:06.200> will

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:12.620 
same way cube root of Y cubed will
become<00:03:07.590> just<00:03:08.310> Y<00:03:08.670> and<00:03:09.380> on<00:03:10.380> the<00:03:10.530> numerator<00:03:11.630> we

become just Y and on the numerator we

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:19.090 
become just Y and on the numerator we
have<00:03:12.660> cube<00:03:13.320> root<00:03:13.620> of<00:03:14.420> 2<00:03:15.420> X<00:03:15.930> square<00:03:16.739> Y<00:03:17.640> square

power 2 is less than 3 y square is not a
perfect<00:03:31.860> cube<00:03:32.010> and<00:03:32.280> the<00:03:32.459> power<00:03:32.700> 2<00:03:33.060> is<00:03:33.360> less

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
perfect cube and the power 2 is less

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:36.920 
perfect cube and the power 2 is less
than<00:03:33.870> 3<00:03:34.190> so<00:03:35.190> we<00:03:35.340> cannot<00:03:35.610> do<00:03:35.850> anything<00:03:36.390> beyond

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
than 3 so we cannot do anything beyond

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.860 
than 3 so we cannot do anything beyond
just<00:03:37.440> keeping<00:03:37.799> it<00:03:37.950> as<00:03:38.160> it<00:03:38.370> is<00:03:38.690> so<00:03:39.690> the

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
just keeping it as it is so the

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:44.630 
just keeping it as it is so the
numerator<00:03:40.580> just<00:03:41.580> stays<00:03:41.850> as<00:03:42.209> cube<00:03:42.630> root<00:03:42.900> of<00:03:43.250> 2<00:03:44.250> X

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:44.640 
numerator just stays as cube root of 2 X

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:49.280 
numerator just stays as cube root of 2 X
square<00:03:45.630> Y<00:03:46.260> square<00:03:46.850> whereas<00:03:47.850> the<00:03:48.570> denominator

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
square Y square whereas the denominator

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:54.440 
square Y square whereas the denominator
is<00:03:49.709> 2y<00:03:50.700> we<00:03:51.690> have<00:03:51.840> taken<00:03:52.260> the<00:03:52.560> radical<00:03:53.040> away<00:03:53.450> in

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
is 2y we have taken the radical away in

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:56.750 
is 2y we have taken the radical away in
the<00:03:54.780> denominator<00:03:55.320> so<00:03:55.830> we<00:03:55.950> have<00:03:56.040> rationalized

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
the denominator so we have rationalized

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:00.860 
the denominator so we have rationalized
the<00:03:57.299> denominator<00:03:57.330> of<00:03:58.760> the<00:03:59.760> given<00:04:00.120> Radek

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 
the denominator of the given Radek

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:09.440 
the denominator of the given Radek
expression<00:04:05.000> hope<00:04:06.000> this<00:04:06.209> helps<00:04:06.569> thank<00:04:07.200> you
