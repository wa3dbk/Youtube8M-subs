00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.110
 when I dream 

00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:13.980
 Talk guys on youtube but follow beauty 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.680
 again bringing another interview to 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:19.410
 You guys this time, it's the little filipino. 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:22.830
 said face beauty will stay quiet 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.869
 The galerinha, my tranquility, let's go 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:28.710
 starting here with the questions about the 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:30.210
 crossfire allows the techniques which 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.759
 your name is your age 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.860
 Let's call pinto martins. I have 18 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.930
 years 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:42.360
 What is my sensitivity all about? 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:44.579
 safe will follow and what 4 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:51.059
 improve but what fits the most 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:01:00.379
 to play I think at 47 in four and one 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:01:00.379
 sincere map adapts more black and strong 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:09.780
 When did you start playing because you 're going to play? 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.760
 It's been about eight months since I started playing 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.189
 Because I was a neighbor, we should leave the people. 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:17.970
 play with them is if he invited me to 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:24.750
 talk to farc and I accepted this 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:42.329
 year for her to play professionally 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:44.130
 same goal, I think it's more 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:49.799
 stronger than ever we have a side 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:51.960
 much to sing again and has on average 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:56.640
 eight hours a day 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:58.649
 quite and the preparatory bgs so 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.850
 prepared I think we may have a little 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:02.340
 still 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:05.399
 we are very prepared in turn 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:07.619
 from Helium, we lived many things 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:10.020
 people that the product had to 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:12.569
 tarija not only the great good and we are 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.810
 very prepared for it and what is the 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:15.489
 expectancy 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:20.099
 You have to face it, I think 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:24.760
 They are ready do not know think 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:27.520
 is more prepared that he understands the 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:29.980
 which teams have already passed and in 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:36.730
 Which did you come to fit more 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:40.569
 fast and came playing well so I guess 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:47.290
 which today was also the basis 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:03:16.830
 Now I'm going to go to the side and when 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:03:16.830
 I was 16 years old and I started playing because 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:04:04.269
 I also started to play a little 

00:03:49.329 --> 00:04:07.810
 improve your 41 even more and I think 

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:13.150
 some 15 or 16 countries 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:15.400
 some basic in france spain china and 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:18.609
 related 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:24.180
 Sweden is a very quiet country 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:24.180
 polite and I really liked it there. 

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:32.330
 a dependent of the country in a championship 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:35.580
 such as in China last year 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:37.170
 the car I think it's an incredible feeling 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:39.540
 I think it 's one of the best I 've ever felt 

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:42.210
 in my life is a good deal I always 

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:44.220
 I dreamed that way and it was sensational chaos 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:47.340
 enter the stage second woman from brazil 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:50.070
 and have thousands of people looking 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:53.750
 Do you snake flag of your country? 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:53.750
 so I think it was very fast too 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:05:00.510
 since the death of the world on btl that you 

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:03.060
 Be very happy there after the dlr com 

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:05.610
 very successful and I will leave with which 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:12.720
 the continuous interview ends 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:15.770
 thank you there and ask prefer 

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:18.330
 play cef o cs go 

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:20.370
 I like to play both of them and not like 

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:22.770
 I played points too but I do not think so. 

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:25.080
 The moment the coffee party has more emotion 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:27.720
 that this coup 

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:29.400
 type like this is to load the name of a 

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:32.970
 team in two different games is what is 

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:36.510
 the type adaptation so delay of the capital 

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:45.090
 You 're ready to play today and 

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:46.650
 tomorrow afternoon in cfz df my name is 

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:49.770
 the same organization 

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:52.460
 I think this makes it much easier. 

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:54.180
 I think if it was a different game, it's 

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:55.770
 difference organizations 

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:57.330
 had some problem but how is it? 

00:05:55.770 --> 00:06:01.650
 same team so I do not think it has 

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:04.380
 No problem, but I know we did. 

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:07.170

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:10.170

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:13.680
