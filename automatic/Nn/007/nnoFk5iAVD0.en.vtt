00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:04.030
 did you know that once lived long and quite a few computer games 

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:07.630
 to improve eyesight, British researchers want to find out 

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:09.009
 to have 

00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:13.279
 the number of studies on computer games is so obvious again 

00:00:13.279 --> 00:00:17.899
 I found out that invest and I take that game I play it is all right 

00:00:17.899 --> 00:00:21.980
 Finally, a market in which billions are earned there is two 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:25.189
 Experts three opinions quite helpful 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:29.519
 but the conclusions are not as complete as they like to claim 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.520
 the cattle and especially very comprehensive studies say that with increasing 

00:00:33.519 --> 00:00:39.650
 Consumption of violent games also increasingly becomes virtual real violence 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:42.810
 We had warned accordingly two years ago and were for it 

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:47.300
 violently attacked rather relieve »the analyzes like to come from the 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.880
 University of Applied Sciences Cologne and 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:53.660
 supported by the computer games industry Rainer Fromm reports 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:59.159
 the team from the game Cities Schein Andreas 

00:00:59.159 --> 00:01:02.889
 the player is supposed to make a criminal career connect to the game 

00:01:02.889 --> 00:01:06.380
 It is also necessary to be able to purify ordinary passers-by in the morning 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.840
 the game is released from 16 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.150
 Schneitter sorry for him another game 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.700
 This time, the player takes on the role of a sniper 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.410
 Main task of deadly precision Shots a typical scene 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:28.990
 no question such violent games are widespread and popular only that 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:31.720
 causes that in the case of mostly minors players 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.720
 the Criminological Institute of Lower Saxony under Professor Pfeiffer 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:39.430
 asked for his latest study nearly 19 thousand students the largest ever 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:41.330
 Collection of this species in Europe 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:44.180
 now that's the result 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:45.960
 isolated the teenagers are 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.740
 the more they dive into this world of killing the more they are endangered 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.320
 through different life perspective 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.280
 they did not let them come to full development 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.630
 the more likely that is then 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:59.539
 what she is 

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:04.329
 Actively doing the computer also putting into action that they bandage others 

00:02:04.329 --> 00:02:07.450
 become violent up to very bad violent excesses 

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:11.200
 the study continues 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.200
 here brutal the games the more devastating the effect 

00:02:15.439 --> 00:02:19.529
 Regardless of media usage, 8 Lake Como Xcode Center 

00:02:19.529 --> 00:02:20.579
 girl 

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:23.609
 and 25, 1 percent of the boys get violent 

00:02:24.469 --> 00:02:28.519
 In the case of adolescents who are indexed on a regular basis, that is especially brutal 

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:33.439
 Use of games increases the proportion of girls to 24 point 5 in boys 

00:02:33.439 --> 00:02:35.909
 at 38 percent 

00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:38.929
 in conjunction with other stress factors 

00:02:38.929 --> 00:02:43.559
 beat the parental home Tomorrow wants to be with a pupil that you outsider that 

00:02:43.559 --> 00:02:44.309
 you 

00:02:44.309 --> 00:02:47.069
 not very conscious in the middle of life 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:49.429
 mean computer games 

00:02:49.429 --> 00:02:53.489
 that does not show an action alternative that would otherwise not come to mind 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:54.289
 would 

00:02:54.289 --> 00:02:59.189
 meant acted by the active play then a step closer to 

00:02:59.189 --> 00:03:02.269
 Use violence actively yourself 

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:04.699
 the market is booming 

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:08.389
 Overall, sales of PC games and consoles in Germany increased 

00:03:08.389 --> 00:03:11.439
 Last year on almost 1 comment spring had Euro 

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:15.829
 in the boxes are found particularly brutal game 

00:03:16.429 --> 00:03:20.309
 their effect is evidenced by another new scientific study 

00:03:20.309 --> 00:03:24.449
 For two years, researchers interviewed 12- to 14-year-old students 

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:27.459
 their use of violence »media he shows himself 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:28.499
 the youngsters 

00:03:28.499 --> 00:03:31.499
 Emil and, above all, even in childhood elementary school age 

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:38.209
 every morning the morning after tomorrow already accused of dubbing 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:42.019
 Forum problems play everywhere like Doom or runs up 

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:45.469
 experience strong feelings of hatred 

00:03:45.469 --> 00:03:51.519
 and that about how feelings are conditioned over the years 

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:55.249
 firmly attached as a tie features 

00:03:55.769 --> 00:04:00.180
 an attitude that continues to influence adolescents in their behavior 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:04.669
 the joint study of the University of Tübingen and the School Counseling Center 

00:04:04.669 --> 00:04:05.799
 Bavaria Post 

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:09.439
 shows a direct relationship between computer games and real 

00:04:09.439 --> 00:04:12.049
 Violence quote 

00:04:12.049 --> 00:04:16.700
 the more in middle childhood horror and violent films are consumed 

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:20.990
 and the more violent games played at the beginning of adolescence the more 

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:24.590
 greater is the student violence and delinquency Smith 14 years 

00:04:26.999 --> 00:04:29.999
 Other results can be obtained at the Cologne University of Applied Sciences 

00:04:30.569 --> 00:04:35.580
 she organizes conventions as it re-focuses on computer games 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:37.249
 adjust 

00:04:37.249 --> 00:04:40.619
 Scientists protect the gaming industry and they send 

00:04:40.619 --> 00:04:43.619
 their representatives like to attend these events 

00:04:44.279 --> 00:04:47.459
 basically, one has to say that computer games are very many positive 

00:04:47.459 --> 00:04:49.199
 Have effects 

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:52.650
 I say even play is smart I can then learn a lot 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:56.069
 do not learn to be in 3d will find your way and i will always learn 

00:04:56.069 --> 00:05:00.880
 recorded the victory and defeat and with frustration or even with success 

00:05:00.879 --> 00:05:04.009
 to deal much better when done 

00:05:04.009 --> 00:05:07.009
 Dr 

00:05:11.529 --> 00:05:15.260
 Their judgment they play is something that is very human to us 

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:19.380
 that it can engage in a cause judges can be interested 

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:22.529
 Do not concentrate anymore while playing 

00:05:22.529 --> 00:05:25.949
 and even the latest studies are taken at the University of Applied Sciences 

00:05:25.949 --> 00:05:29.870
 Knowledge remains but computer games must be no violence 

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:34.220
 it is more sun than brain jogging that is the gray brain cells in land 

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:35.100
 Kept momentum 

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:39.090
 but that what is learned there has an immediate transfer into it 

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:42.999
 real world has in a positive light and the negative also not 

00:05:42.999 --> 00:05:46.169
 I think this is from previous research 

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:46.939
 now 

00:05:46.939 --> 00:05:50.689
 Cologne University of Applied Sciences works closely with industry 

00:05:50.689 --> 00:05:54.509
 which participates financially in an information center in the body of the FH 

00:05:54.509 --> 00:05:56.749
 Called travel 

00:05:56.749 --> 00:05:59.749
 How much money has flowed you will not betray 

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:03.990
 I do not want to tell you more exact numbers, but "So significant are the numbers 

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:06.259
 Means certainly not but they help us 

00:06:06.259 --> 00:06:10.550
 to improve the fact i like take down from headroom 

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:14.259
 The financiers also include a manufacturer of particularly brutal games 

00:06:14.819 --> 00:06:18.000
 This is unbearable for some scientists at the institute 

00:06:18.699 --> 00:06:23.849
 the lecturers Elke Ost Bon Fischer SID according to their own research thoroughly 

00:06:23.849 --> 00:06:27.189
 the connection between violent games and violence 

00:06:27.189 --> 00:06:30.939
 Science cubes do not serve the interests of the industry 

00:06:32.499 --> 00:06:34.020
 the hens 

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:37.830
 Manufacturer of the man did not manage some 

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:42.020
 Professionals to attract scientists and practitioners as well 

00:06:42.809 --> 00:06:44.539
 and like her 

00:06:44.539 --> 00:06:47.590
 Rebuilded from the market to save products 

00:06:48.319 --> 00:06:52.449
 but that percent of scientists can be harnessed for that 

00:06:53.759 --> 00:06:55.499
 I agree 

00:06:55.499 --> 00:06:57.369
 frankly devastating 

00:06:57.369 --> 00:07:01.219
 and that's what I say in the house that the swords of course a little bit the 

00:07:01.219 --> 00:07:02.649
 collegial 

00:07:02.649 --> 00:07:06.789
 Percent cooperation what we got from the industry are pledged 

00:07:06.789 --> 00:07:08.139
 Means that help us 

00:07:08.139 --> 00:07:12.090
 work more effectively and we pay close attention to that we are not there 

00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:13.719
 get corrupted 

00:07:13.719 --> 00:07:17.889
 but for Professor Pfeiffer and other scientists, colleagues have 

00:07:17.889 --> 00:07:18.869
 can 

00:07:18.869 --> 00:07:20.729
 her reputation 

00:07:20.729 --> 00:07:22.639
 playful 

00:07:22.639 --> 00:07:24.919
 they had lost their credibility 

00:07:24.919 --> 00:07:29.280
 if they get their money from those who are not interested in it 

00:07:29.279 --> 00:07:32.279
 Main downplayed by computer games 

00:07:32.979 --> 00:07:36.379
 Therefore, she can not seriously take seriously anyone that is regrettable 

00:07:36.379 --> 00:07:39.379
 but that schools and parents that we do not know 

00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:48.120
 who are the ministers of the interior of four unions governed states 

00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:51.839
 now demand a complete ban on killer games 

00:07:51.839 --> 00:07:55.659
 Schleck the Kulturrat now before that computer games just like movies 

00:07:55.659 --> 00:08:00.120
 State sponsored will say this was not the last post 

00:08:00.119 --> 00:08:00.699
 on the subject
