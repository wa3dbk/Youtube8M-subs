pretty<00:01:27.910> comfortable<00:01:28.090> and<00:01:28.540> I'm<00:01:28.630> it<00:01:28.750> was<00:01:28.840> pretty

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
pretty comfortable and I'm it was pretty

00:01:29.610 --> 00:02:30.710 
pretty comfortable and I'm it was pretty
pretty<00:01:30.610> good<00:01:30.760> face<00:01:30.910> for<00:01:31.060> me<00:01:31.180> so

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.700 

I<00:02:32.180> felt<00:02:33.180> great<00:02:33.450> for<00:02:33.720> the<00:02:33.810> first<00:02:34.080> couple<00:02:34.320> miles

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:34.710 
I felt great for the first couple miles

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:38.660 
I felt great for the first couple miles
I<00:02:35.160> was<00:02:35.970> good<00:02:36.120> downhill<00:02:36.630> like<00:02:36.990> I<00:02:37.200> predicted<00:02:37.670> but

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
I was good downhill like I predicted but

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.690 
I was good downhill like I predicted but
after<00:02:39.420> that<00:02:39.540> I<00:02:39.600> just<00:02:40.040> gradually<00:02:41.040> started

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
after that I just gradually started

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.570 
after that I just gradually started
going<00:02:41.970> slower<00:02:42.530> overall<00:02:43.530> I<00:02:43.560> got<00:02:43.920> second<00:02:44.400> place

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
going slower overall I got second place

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:47.900 
going slower overall I got second place
I<00:02:45.530> I<00:02:46.530> think<00:02:46.890> it<00:02:46.950> was<00:02:47.010> a<00:02:47.100> great<00:02:47.310> race<00:02:47.460> overall

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
I I think it was a great race overall

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:51.230 
I I think it was a great race overall
though<00:02:48.270> I<00:02:48.750> felt<00:02:49.710> pretty<00:02:50.400> good<00:02:50.640> i<00:02:50.700> just<00:02:51.030> kept

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:51.240 
though I felt pretty good i just kept

00:02:51.240 --> 00:03:47.810 
though I felt pretty good i just kept
going<00:02:51.480> slower

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:47.820 

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:53.400 

ha<00:03:48.820> I<00:03:49.620> took<00:03:50.620> 2nd<00:03:51.070> overall<00:03:51.280> and<00:03:51.610> so<00:03:52.390> it<00:03:53.050> was<00:03:53.110> it

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:53.410 
ha I took 2nd overall and so it was it

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:55.410 
ha I took 2nd overall and so it was it
was<00:03:53.530> tougher<00:03:53.890> than<00:03:53.920> I<00:03:54.100> thought<00:03:54.130> but<00:03:54.640> I<00:03:54.940> mean

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:55.420 
was tougher than I thought but I mean

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:57.450 
was tougher than I thought but I mean
it's<00:03:55.600> it's<00:03:55.840> a<00:03:55.960> marathon<00:03:56.200> you<00:03:56.650> you're<00:03:56.980> clearing

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:57.460 
it's it's a marathon you you're clearing

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:59.310 
it's it's a marathon you you're clearing
it<00:03:57.640> for<00:03:57.850> the<00:03:57.940> endurance<00:03:58.330> of<00:03:58.480> it<00:03:58.690> and<00:03:58.870> even

00:03:59.310 --> 00:03:59.320 
it for the endurance of it and even

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:00.750 
it for the endurance of it and even
though<00:03:59.470> it<00:03:59.530> didn't<00:03:59.740> go<00:03:59.830> as<00:03:59.860> well<00:04:00.190> as<00:04:00.400> I<00:04:00.550> planned

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:00.760 
though it didn't go as well as I planned

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:04.170 
though it didn't go as well as I planned
I<00:04:01.030> still<00:04:01.420> had<00:04:01.990> a<00:04:02.020> great<00:04:02.620> time<00:04:02.830> though<00:04:03.040> I<00:04:03.310> think

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:04.180 
I still had a great time though I think

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:05.430 
I still had a great time though I think
it<00:04:04.240> was<00:04:04.330> well<00:04:04.510> put<00:04:04.690> on<00:04:04.840> I<00:04:04.870> mean<00:04:05.140> everything

back<00:04:59.120> in<00:04:59.330> two<00:04:59.540> thousand<00:04:59.930> six<00:05:00.729> kind<00:05:01.729> of<00:05:01.820> just

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:02.000 
back in two thousand six kind of just

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.350 
back in two thousand six kind of just
ran<00:05:02.180> it<00:05:02.330> for<00:05:02.510> fun<00:05:02.660> just<00:05:02.990> for<00:05:03.470> the<00:05:03.530> experience

but<00:05:05.360> yeah<00:05:05.510> I<00:05:05.540> think<00:05:05.660> this<00:05:05.900> would<00:05:06.080> be<00:05:06.110> a<00:05:06.199> great

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:06.380 
but yeah I think this would be a great

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:08.879 
but yeah I think this would be a great
course<00:05:06.740> to<00:05:06.979> qualify<00:05:07.370> for<00:05:07.610> boston<00:05:07.729> on<00:05:08.120> because

00:05:08.879 --> 00:05:08.889 
course to qualify for boston on because

00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:10.930 
course to qualify for boston on because
you<00:05:09.889> know<00:05:09.979> i<00:05:10.010> think<00:05:10.100> it<00:05:10.340> has<00:05:10.490> its<00:05:10.699> challenges

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:10.940 
you know i think it has its challenges

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:14.379 
you know i think it has its challenges
but<00:05:11.300> overall<00:05:11.690> it's<00:05:12.380> fast<00:05:13.040> for<00:05:13.340> sure<00:05:13.490> I<00:05:13.760> like

00:05:14.379 --> 00:05:14.389 
but overall it's fast for sure I like

00:05:14.389 --> 00:05:16.600 
but overall it's fast for sure I like
that<00:05:14.570> horses<00:05:15.260> I<00:05:15.470> like<00:05:15.650> point-to-point<00:05:16.100> and

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:16.610 
that horses I like point-to-point and

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:20.590 
that horses I like point-to-point and
smaller<00:05:17.510> races<00:05:18.050> low<00:05:18.260> frills

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:20.600 

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:27.510 

then<00:05:20.810> like<00:05:21.230> the<00:05:21.470> rock<00:05:21.680> and<00:05:21.860> roll<00:05:21.920> races<00:05:22.580> are

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:27.520 

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:31.240 

it's<00:05:28.520> kind<00:05:28.940> of<00:05:29.000> like<00:05:29.120> a<00:05:29.180> lot<00:05:29.480> of<00:05:30.250> the
