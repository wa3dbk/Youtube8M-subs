00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:38.230
 loredana who came with us to the trials 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:42.920
 It is a team what he Chapter 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:45.380
 unfortunately this team will have to leave 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:47.930
 one of the two federica but daria 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:50.360
 biancardi she put together 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:52.010
 you knew you were creating a unique show 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:53.480
 but I also knew that you should have 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:54.470
 do without one of these two 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:56.750
 singers 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:59.350
 no no really really piero I don't know 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:02.959
 what he will do tonight but the thing that has me 

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:06.799
 fascinated and see the panterina 

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:09.310
 young to have such a strong grit of 

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:11.060
 facing a panther that boys 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:18.639
 would kill anyone 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:21.320
 ap the song says that in short canada 

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:24.800
 he says take another small piece 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:26.690
 of which no and they heart pieces do not 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:31.070
 they go to bits and pieces they have them 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:33.150
 that is, guided global wage girls 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:36.750
 you have swept away 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:39.720
 idea there is nothing left to who you would be there 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:46.140
 chance to go lockout maybe you know 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:47.700
 for a nap maybe because it's a lot a 

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:52.620
 an incredible experience that a 

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:56.910
 inhuman control and I would choose air 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:59.280
 but late but it is just one 

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:02.670
 of a breeze that is a breeze 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:04.530
 move a feather because it is a moment that 

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:06.840
 if then I look at her then I do less maybe 

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:09.330
 however, he also did an exhibition 

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:13.020
 incredible comes straight into the heart with 

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:18.480
 the voice the low- brow eyes give you that 

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:20.280
 it looks like a tokyo violin player is 

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:23.310
 came time are all 

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:24.480
 let's take your piero use this 

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:26.730
 euphemism 

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:29.450
 we use this tourism we think this 

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:29.450
 nice word 

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:35.550
 the battle all sky inside me 

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:38.670
 to understand whether to carry on young 

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:41.850
 shoot a small panther who 

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:47.550
 will surely become very strong in 

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:50.400
 within a short time or if you bring the 

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:55.140
 panterona was already so experienced 

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:57.900
 and with the most decisive and sure step why 

00:05:55.140 --> 00:06:00.440
 the game is now much more done 

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:00.440
 hard 

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:11.430
 I think I'll feel a little more confident if 

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:11.430
 air will be committing 

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:21.860
 daria biancardi continues his 

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:23.710
 device adventure towards the scout again 

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:25.500

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:29.820

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:33.470
 with claws, he stayed on board 

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:33.470
