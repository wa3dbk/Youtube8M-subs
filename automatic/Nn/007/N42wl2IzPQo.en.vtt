I<00:00:08.309> think<00:00:08.519> you're<00:00:08.639> going<00:00:08.730> to<00:00:08.820> find<00:00:09.030> interesting

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:10.130 
I think you're going to find interesting

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:13.249 
I think you're going to find interesting
it's<00:00:11.130> time<00:00:11.580> accelerated<00:00:12.480> so<00:00:12.660> we<00:00:12.780> can<00:00:12.900> see<00:00:13.110> the

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
it's time accelerated so we can see the

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:15.410 
it's time accelerated so we can see the
swimmers<00:00:13.590> pass<00:00:13.920> as<00:00:14.490> they<00:00:14.730> swim<00:00:15.059> in<00:00:15.089> here

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
swimmers pass as they swim in here

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.630 
swimmers pass as they swim in here
towards<00:00:15.900> the<00:00:16.020> finish<00:00:16.289> line<00:00:16.320> of<00:00:16.770> the<00:00:17.100> event

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
towards the finish line of the event

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.870 
towards the finish line of the event
it's<00:00:18.330> a<00:00:18.420> 1.9<00:00:19.080> kilometer<00:00:19.650> swim<00:00:19.920> and<00:00:20.130> these

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
it's a 1.9 kilometer swim and these

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.189 
it's a 1.9 kilometer swim and these
swimmers<00:00:21.119> are<00:00:21.330> swimming<00:00:21.510> in<00:00:21.689> the<00:00:21.750> region<00:00:22.109> of

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
swimmers are swimming in the region of

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.769 
swimmers are swimming in the region of
30<00:00:22.230> to<00:00:22.890> 40<00:00:23.310> minutes<00:00:23.460> for<00:00:23.789> that<00:00:23.910> swim<00:00:24.210> so

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
30 to 40 minutes for that swim so

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.390 
30 to 40 minutes for that swim so
probably<00:00:25.289> about<00:00:25.439> the<00:00:25.590> same<00:00:25.800> speed<00:00:26.099> as

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
probably about the same speed as

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.200 
probably about the same speed as
yourself

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210

now<00:00:28.080> if<00:00:28.170> use<00:00:28.289> some<00:00:28.470> special<00:00:28.740> motion<00:00:29.189> tracking

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
now if use some special motion tracking

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.490 
now if use some special motion tracking
