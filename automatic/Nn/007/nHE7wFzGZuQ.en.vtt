00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.960
 the rain is more pleasant on the suzuki 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:09.599
 swift my first car 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.910
 were apparently already feeling warm 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.880

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:17.250
 the rain yes that you like that 

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:18.300
 cozy loud 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.119
 how do you think it is in the new 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.070
 season he studies what will be isolated 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:26.099
 are keeping I guess so but treasure 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.590
 in between let's do it and you want to finish 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.240
 reading before the rain is not there 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.980
 gh maybe just close because then 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.980
 I don't think it's going smart at all 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.120
 instruments such as and by the way suki 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.219
 swift it sounds a bit more distant 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.989
 there that the real ticking is here 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.989
 there is more car or bicycle around your boss 

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:06.320
 and how well prepared I must say he 

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:10.820
 is a bit spicier than expected 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:12.530
 yes yes but that is a positive one anyway 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:15.800
 that's definitely close photos it has anyway 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:17.780
 a bit the image of yes the 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:19.700
 frugality is paramount so you expect 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.470
 well then you have to get in on the rest but me 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.060
 I actually think that's really bad 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:27.770
 not too bad in the people now though 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:30.260
 music and car very few actually yes 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:33.500
 I really enjoy it one night I was 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:35.210
 already lined up, and yes it is a bit dark to 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.310
 The result will be a bit of the king 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:39.410
 the road feeling and then I like to listen 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.660
 just that car rushing over the 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:43.940
 away and locks of the engine 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:46.790
 yes just on your roof yes and you know things 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:49.570
 which country car screen you have very much your 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:49.570
 romantic existence 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.570
 and yes that cart
