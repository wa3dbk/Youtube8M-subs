and<00:00:44.280> I'm<00:00:44.460> just<00:00:44.730> going<00:00:44.910> to<00:00:45.090> drag<00:00:45.510> it<00:00:45.690> into<00:00:45.870> the

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
and I'm just going to drag it into the

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.940 
and I'm just going to drag it into the
minecraft<00:00:46.410> server<00:00:46.469> folder<00:00:47.039> clear<00:00:48.030> this<00:00:48.210> now

minecraft server folder clear this now

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:53.180 
minecraft server folder clear this now
so<00:00:49.950> this<00:00:50.460> jar<00:00:51.000> file<00:00:51.300> will<00:00:51.809> eventually<00:00:52.500> be<00:00:52.920> our

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
so this jar file will eventually be our

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.100 
so this jar file will eventually be our
server<00:00:53.550> as<00:00:53.850> of<00:00:54.180> now<00:00:54.300> we<00:00:54.600> don't<00:00:54.809> really<00:00:54.899> care

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
about it you know as you consume can't

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.880 
about it you know as you consume can't
focus<00:00:56.910> failed<00:00:57.210> filled<00:00:58.109> things<00:00:58.350> but<00:00:58.590> I'll<00:00:58.710> show

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
TextEdit make sure you can click format

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.490 
TextEdit make sure you can click format
and<00:01:11.159> you<00:01:11.610> want<00:01:11.790> to<00:01:11.850> make<00:01:12.000> sure<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.780> format<00:01:13.170> is

plain<00:01:13.830> text<00:01:14.400> I<00:01:14.549> think<00:01:15.000> the<00:01:15.060> default<00:01:15.210> is<00:01:15.509> plain

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
plain text I think the default is plain

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.070 
plain text I think the default is plain
text<00:01:16.049> so<00:01:16.170> you<00:01:16.259> should<00:01:16.409> be<00:01:16.530> fine<00:01:16.710> but<00:01:17.689> so<00:01:18.689> here<00:01:19.049> I

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
text so you should be fine but so here I

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.469 
text so you should be fine but so here I
have<00:01:19.320> this<00:01:19.740> this<00:01:20.340> piece<00:01:20.640> of<00:01:20.790> coding<00:01:21.330> right

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
have this this piece of coding right

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:22.999 
have this this piece of coding right
here<00:01:21.750> it'll<00:01:21.960> be<00:01:22.049> in<00:01:22.229> the<00:01:22.350> video<00:01:22.650> description

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
here it'll be in the video description

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.580 
here it'll be in the video description
so<00:01:23.640> you<00:01:23.729> can<00:01:23.759> get<00:01:23.970> it<00:01:24.060> easily<00:01:24.210> from<00:01:24.600> there<00:01:24.780> but

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
so you can get it easily from there but

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.179 
so you can get it easily from there but
um<00:01:25.890> what<00:01:26.549> this<00:01:26.729> does<00:01:27.229> is<00:01:28.229> it<00:01:28.560> gives<00:01:28.680> the<00:01:28.799> server

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
um what this does is it gives the server

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.580 
um what this does is it gives the server
more<00:01:29.369> memory<00:01:29.700> so<00:01:30.420> it'll<00:01:30.630> actually<00:01:30.720> run<00:01:31.110> faster

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
more memory so it'll actually run faster

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.069 
more memory so it'll actually run faster
by<00:01:32.490> changing<00:01:32.909> these<00:01:33.000> numbers<00:01:33.479> right<00:01:33.659> here<00:01:33.930> you

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
by changing these numbers right here you

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:35.840 
by changing these numbers right here you
cannot<00:01:34.409> you<00:01:34.740> can<00:01:34.890> show<00:01:35.070> how<00:01:35.250> much<00:01:35.369> memory<00:01:35.579> you

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
cannot you can show how much memory you

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.690 
cannot you can show how much memory you
want<00:01:35.939> to<00:01:36.090> give<00:01:36.180> this<00:01:36.329> over<00:01:36.689> I<00:01:37.280> said<00:01:38.280> to<00:01:38.460> data

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
want to give this over I said to data

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.249 
want to give this over I said to data
bytes<00:01:38.880> cuz<00:01:39.180> that's<00:01:39.420> the<00:01:39.570> amount<00:01:39.750> of<00:01:39.869> RAM<00:01:40.079> my

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
bytes cuz that's the amount of RAM my

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.770 
bytes cuz that's the amount of RAM my
computer<00:01:40.590> my<00:01:40.920> computer<00:01:40.950> has<00:01:41.490> if<00:01:42.360> yours<00:01:42.600> has

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
computer my computer has if yours has

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.870 
computer my computer has if yours has
more<00:01:43.049> you<00:01:43.320> can<00:01:43.470> always<00:01:43.619> change<00:01:44.100> that<00:01:44.369> and<00:01:44.549> the

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
more you can always change that and the

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.600 
more you can always change that and the
server<00:01:45.090> will<00:01:45.210> be<00:01:45.329> even<00:01:45.899> faster<00:01:46.100> but<00:01:47.100> anyways

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
server will be even faster but anyways

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.719 
server will be even faster but anyways
we<00:01:47.790> want<00:01:48.000> to<00:01:48.180> want<00:01:48.990> to<00:01:49.049> save<00:01:49.259> this<00:01:49.549> right<00:01:50.549> here

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
we want to want to save this right here

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.819 
we want to want to save this right here
in<00:01:50.909> a<00:01:50.970> minecraft<00:01:51.509> server<00:01:51.630> let's<00:01:52.560> call<00:01:52.710> it

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
in a minecraft server let's call it

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.429

hold so um on the server this this is

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:56.870 
hold so um on the server this this is
what<00:02:55.740> it'll<00:02:55.860> look<00:02:55.950> like<00:02:56.100> when<00:02:56.430> the<00:02:56.520> server<00:02:56.730> is

here I'll show to you guys
it's<00:03:49.230> called<00:03:49.410> port<00:03:49.860> map<00:03:50.070> I'll<00:03:50.340> probably<00:03:50.790> have

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
it's called port map I'll probably have

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:55.070 
it's called port map I'll probably have
the<00:03:52.400> dystrophy<00:03:53.400> link<00:03:54.060> right<00:03:54.239> here<00:03:54.510> in<00:03:54.690> the

anything<00:04:45.889> minecraft<00:04:46.460> it's<00:04:46.610> probably<00:04:46.850> the

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:46.910 
anything minecraft it's probably the

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:50.770 
anything minecraft it's probably the
simplest<00:04:47.590> add<00:04:48.590> mapping<00:04:49.540> make<00:04:50.540> sure<00:04:50.660> the

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:50.780 
simplest add mapping make sure the

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:52.750 
simplest add mapping make sure the
screen<00:04:51.050> lights<00:04:51.290> on<00:04:51.500> and<00:04:51.740> this<00:04:52.070> is<00:04:52.250> on<00:04:52.490> that

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:52.760 
screen lights on and this is on that

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:54.720 
screen lights on and this is on that
that<00:04:53.030> means<00:04:53.210> the<00:04:53.330> port<00:04:53.600> is<00:04:53.780> functioning<00:04:54.320> and

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:54.730 
that means the port is functioning and

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:57.250 
that means the port is functioning and
that<00:04:55.730> means<00:04:56.120> that<00:04:56.240> people<00:04:56.300> can<00:04:56.570> actually

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:57.260 
that means that people can actually

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.110 
that means that people can actually
access<00:04:57.470> your<00:04:57.919> server<00:04:58.160> from<00:04:58.580> their<00:04:59.030> own

00:04:59.110 --> 00:04:59.120 
access your server from their own

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:01.120 
access your server from their own
computers<00:04:59.630> what<00:05:00.530> they're<00:05:00.650> going<00:05:00.740> to<00:05:00.800> do<00:05:00.980> is

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:01.130 
computers what they're going to do is

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:02.530 
computers what they're going to do is
they're<00:05:01.250> going<00:05:01.280> to<00:05:01.400> type<00:05:01.610> in<00:05:01.790> this<00:05:02.060> number

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:02.540 
they're going to type in this number

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:04.570 
they're going to type in this number
that's<00:05:03.140> just<00:05:03.470> your<00:05:03.560> IP<00:05:03.770> you're<00:05:04.370> still

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:04.580 
that's just your IP you're still

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:07.510 
that's just your IP you're still
probably<00:05:04.970> be<00:05:05.180> different<00:05:05.720> than<00:05:05.840> mine<00:05:06.050> and<00:05:06.520> and

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:07.520 
probably be different than mine and and

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:09.130 
probably be different than mine and and
they'll<00:05:08.240> just<00:05:08.360> do<00:05:08.660> that<00:05:08.810> in<00:05:08.990> their

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:09.140 
they'll just do that in their

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:13.570 
they'll just do that in their
multiplayer<00:05:09.650> multiplayer<00:05:10.430> bar<00:05:10.970> and<00:05:12.040> so<00:05:13.040> if

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:13.580 
multiplayer multiplayer bar and so if

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:16.390 
multiplayer multiplayer bar and so if
this<00:05:13.970> green<00:05:14.300> light<00:05:14.510> is<00:05:14.660> on<00:05:14.840> and<00:05:15.220> you've<00:05:16.220> got

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:16.400 
this green light is on and you've got

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:18.219 
this green light is on and you've got
the<00:05:16.520> server<00:05:16.790> running<00:05:17.150> it<00:05:17.390> says<00:05:17.570> done<00:05:17.930> and<00:05:18.110> no

the server running it says done and no
error<00:05:18.500> messages<00:05:18.950> that<00:05:19.160> means<00:05:19.490> the<00:05:19.640> server

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:19.880 
error messages that means the server

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:22.540 
error messages that means the server
will<00:05:20.270> actually<00:05:20.840> be<00:05:20.990> up<00:05:21.140> and<00:05:21.470> if<00:05:22.010> it's<00:05:22.340> set<00:05:22.520> up

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:22.550 
will actually be up and if it's set up

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:25.629 
will actually be up and if it's set up
for<00:05:22.820> people<00:05:22.970> to<00:05:23.150> access<00:05:23.510> it<00:05:23.690> so<00:05:23.900> uh<00:05:24.560> you<00:05:25.490> should

00:05:25.629 --> 00:05:25.639 
for people to access it so uh you should

00:05:25.639 --> 00:05:28.240 
for people to access it so uh you should
also<00:05:25.760> have<00:05:25.940> terminal<00:05:26.389> open<00:05:26.720> to<00:05:26.919> these<00:05:27.919> these

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:28.250 
also have terminal open to these these

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:30.190 
also have terminal open to these these
three<00:05:28.580> things<00:05:28.820> are<00:05:29.000> the<00:05:29.120> main<00:05:29.570> programs<00:05:30.080> that

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:30.200

three things are the main programs that
you're<00:05:30.350> gonna<00:05:30.470> use<00:05:30.680> for<00:05:30.710> running<00:05:31.130> your<00:05:31.340> server

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:31.580 
you're gonna use for running your server

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:34.990 
you're gonna use for running your server
and<00:05:32.680> that's<00:05:33.680> basically<00:05:34.040> it<00:05:34.250> I<00:05:34.460> hope<00:05:34.820> you<00:05:34.940> guys
