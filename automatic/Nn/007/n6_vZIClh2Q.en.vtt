 closes this morning more to bring the following information 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:46.830
 accompany 

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:53.090
 lame - attempts of this extreme sport were made by the Chinese building 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:56.520
 a kind of umbrella to jump from special towers 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.870
 but of course some were considered parachutes since the case 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.700
 is that in Germany during the Second World War after 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.140
 efe 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:16.010
 we meet with the experts in skydiving as foreigners well very 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:17.149
 good attendees 

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:20.230
 Cáceres well says efe 

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:21.400
 how long already 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:26.160
 it is practically the crisis I have good, I am one of the least have 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:27.920
 another four years 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.110
 this 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.560
 thousand three hundred thousand 400 years 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:40.260
 cristóbal the patients of which 900 million times people are fed up 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:44.020
 it came once but vettel that it jumps the first time a year ago 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:49.080
 I came for 15 years to those main characteristics that should 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.120
 have a parachutist 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:54.690
 feet on the ground 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:57.620
 above all moment be distracted for nothing 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:59.390
 on the 30th of this 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:02.360
 reads must be resolved in the seconds then 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:05.650
 nothing to think about anything else this the paratrooper 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:11.910
 in some conditions the psdg figure n the age in the first state 

00:02:13.839 --> 00:02:15.439
 not good the clear age 

00:02:15.439 --> 00:02:17.779
 apparently it's not going to be just hours 

00:02:17.779 --> 00:02:21.009
 can you tell me about caring well 

00:02:21.009 --> 00:02:24.079
 this have east this is about problems in the column 

00:02:24.929 --> 00:02:27.189
 precious does not trust 

00:02:27.189 --> 00:02:28.439
 e careful 

00:02:28.439 --> 00:02:30.369
 osteoporosis 

00:02:30.369 --> 00:02:33.919
 for the landing in the 35th that's why you can only break your legs 

00:02:34.529 --> 00:02:37.540
 there we are going to take care people inside the heart 

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:43.680
 but that is very delicate because in general there is a great deal going up there 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.199
 effect is purely psychological 

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:47.449
 in the free fall 

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:48.799
 Noel 

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:52.189
 there's nothing physical except when the parachute opens 

00:02:52.189 --> 00:02:56.129
 in parachuting there are two basic modalities with the parachute 

00:02:56.129 --> 00:02:59.600
 missed free fall and with the parachute open 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:03.900
 the free fall is the most practiced since often to the jumpers to 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:08.040
 set themselves aligned in the air to this is called relative work 

00:03:14.039 --> 00:03:17.729
 to practice this fun sports that should start with a good 

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:22.269
 counseling this means taking the course mainly where the balance 

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:25.379
 will be accompanied by the instructor which is also called 

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:30.679
 two 

00:03:30.679 --> 00:03:32.379
 with all this course 

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:36.679
 according to a stream high facts are not seven levels 8 saints 

00:03:36.679 --> 00:03:39.959
 the first set was repeated flavor do not repeat this 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:41.229
 takes two jumps 

00:03:41.229 --> 00:03:42.739
 and after that already 

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:47.230
 and this you graduated is fine but you any mistake you have up there 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:51.049
 reluctant the level not stephen levels are levels committed seven 

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:51.929
 levels 

00:03:51.929 --> 00:03:57.059
 this if it repeats is a process that goes wrong in our profile repeat the effects 

00:03:57.059 --> 00:03:58.299
 it is depends 

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:01.169
 of you and how long it will be 

00:04:01.169 --> 00:04:04.169
 girls from caracas lacking the goalkeeper 

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:06.950
 I think if that light trickles 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:09.249
 but also 

00:04:09.249 --> 00:04:11.300
 Well, you enjoy it very much in 

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:14.700
 Apart from the expensive I think that taking the course that after all is not so 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:15.629
 expensive because 

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:18.349
 it's a sport that anybody 

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:21.929
 I leave tests once and I believe that you do not do not leave it is very beautiful what is 

00:04:21.929 --> 00:04:22.779
 doing 

00:04:22.779 --> 00:04:26.680
 it's not that I think it makes you better person says parachutist from my point 

00:04:26.679 --> 00:04:27.889
 of sight 

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:29.719
 I dont know 

00:04:29.719 --> 00:04:33.450
 certainly the time these putting at risk did not stop the 

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:35.650
 somehow if it scares you 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:37.389
 but 

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:39.139
 so I do not think 

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:42.900
 yes yes if you overcome that fear it's worth a lot no and the cost 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:45.370
 If they have a chance, it's worth it 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:47.500
 and already after the course finished and 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:51.790
 the exception is cheaper in the first attempts obligatorily to the 

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:55.180
 parachutes have an automatic electronic activation device 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:05:00.650
 which works according to the speed and height of the activity the jump explained 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:01.130
 saez 

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:03.159
 effective ggf 

00:05:03.159 --> 00:05:06.309
 you deserve a device that was invented in germany 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:10.210
 and how good it worked cd of heat and atmospheric pressure 

00:05:10.999 --> 00:05:15.319
 executives active at a certain height since it makes for example the text has 

00:05:15.319 --> 00:05:17.080
 liquidation trends 

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:18.960
 the natural space 

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:21.150
 menezes as a guardian angel of the parks 

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:24.379
 how long they last to open their parachute 

00:05:24.379 --> 00:05:27.719
 at the time of his intervention 10 

00:05:27.719 --> 00:05:30.719
 percent and depth on Friday from 9 30 to 35 seconds 

00:05:31.249 --> 00:05:34.249
 and so good to have it in the opening of four thousand 

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:39.509
 maybe not from the parachute 

00:05:39.509 --> 00:05:41.389
 what material is it made of 

00:05:41.389 --> 00:05:42.200
 for one hundrerd 

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:44.009
 is this 

00:05:44.009 --> 00:05:46.300
 are different types the hair 

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:49.300
 then the specials 

00:05:50.309 --> 00:05:51.740
 that dynamic 

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:54.969
 and like they are manufactured in the united states germany 

00:05:54.969 --> 00:05:56.020
 France 

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:59.469
 the strings of three so many in mieres are also destinations 

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:02.590
 a compound of different types of 

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:06.530
 material is very special because at the time of opening murcia as well as those of 

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:08.159
 The two girls are called 

00:06:08.159 --> 00:06:11.300
 according to simó leathers do simple sight but 

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:13.210
 technical name that are girls 

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:15.990
 it will be the moment of opening with some strips 

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:19.669
 now we already know what is necessary for a good jump 

00:06:19.669 --> 00:06:23.270
 and to start this incredible experience you just need to dress 

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:28.690
 so we put on the suit is 100% of the image the helmet the altimeter which 

00:06:28.689 --> 00:06:32.600
 is coupled to the case the view of the attitude through a small 

00:06:32.599 --> 00:06:35.599
 parachute houses and gloves 

00:06:39.919 --> 00:06:42.919
 dv 

00:06:46.219 --> 00:06:48.279
 now yes assault 

00:06:48.279 --> 00:06:49.499
 and good 

00:06:49.499 --> 00:06:53.139
 the one that is not well defined can only go to accompany the flight to 

00:06:53.139 --> 00:06:56.139
 these sporting events 

00:06:58.129 --> 00:07:06.229
 pillar meeting the position of pull bows the handle to activate 

00:07:06.229 --> 00:07:09.249
 the system to try to succeed in poverty 

00:07:09.249 --> 00:07:10.680
 clear that everyone 

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:13.680
 with his own style 

00:07:16.719 --> 00:07:19.719
 inc 

00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:32.789
 what did you think about it with just seeing the images you can feel 

00:07:32.789 --> 00:07:34.760
 An incredible experience 

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:38.080
