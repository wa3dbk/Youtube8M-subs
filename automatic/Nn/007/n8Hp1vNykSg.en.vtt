00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:04.740
 the increase in herd productivity is related to the quality of the 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.780
 genetic material used in the property 

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:12.020
 no use improving the food had well managed passages 

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:16.510
 mineral supplementation to be a parent not for its potential 

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:19.510
 gene capable of responding to this investment 

00:00:22.989 --> 00:00:24.419
 in the video above 

00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:25.579
 the growth 

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:28.579
 to cig 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:35.400
 genetics and starting point for a selection process 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:40.020
 and to know if your herd responds to market expectations you need 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.580
 perform genetic evaluations that will provide the expected differences 

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:46.890
 in progenies pecs 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.520
 this tool assists in the continuous genetic progress of animals and 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:53.090
 increased production 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:55.299
 if you want to improve the herd 

00:00:55.299 --> 00:01:00.019
 There are about ten genetic evaluation programs in Brazil, which contributes 

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:03.200
 in the development of national livestock 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:06.939
 the farm arrived in rondônia has a thousand head of cattle 

00:01:06.939 --> 00:01:10.840
 and shows that it is possible to increase the productivity of the herd by using 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.410
 genetics 

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:16.650
 the 450 matrices produce on average 400 dc 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:19.219
 and the resignations of August 

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:23.439
 know the importance of investing in genetic improvement I think 

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:25.780
 when we talk about meat quality 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:27.010
 He created this. 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:31.440
 When we want a bonus we have to look for Sierra not 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:34.440
 let's go 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.510
 other countries I'm enjoying the game 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:43.409
 the ideas evaluated the characteristics present in the mother 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:48.680
 my father as sexual precocity growth fertility I can break down 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:49.960
 after that 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.980
 the genetic transmission ability of the evaluated animal 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:55.390
 the sunflower 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:57.550
 It's in my concept for example. 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:01.650
 if pressure of selection are can have love pet in the animal 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:05.470
 You have to have heard of it being a program. 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:09.739
 given if you follow a program you reach a certain point 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:13.930
 in the genetic improvement otherwise you never get so much if not by 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.549
 that this guy I will not rule this out does not exist 

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:19.549
 in breeding and Ana 

00:02:22.889 --> 00:02:27.689
 and next week in São Paulo to ascend support other facts about 

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:29.159
 corporate management 

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:32.230
 this session fails the entry is frank for the associates 

00:02:33.039 --> 00:02:35.939
 for more information on the calendar 

00:02:35.939 --> 00:02:40.719
 according to the game about corporate management that session family on the property 

00:02:40.719 --> 00:02:41.480
 rural 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:46.050
 will address among other topics such as workshop farm management and 

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:51.860
 takes place on February 17 from 3 to 7 pm in the exhibition center 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:54.049
 immigrants in sao paulo 

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:58.489
 all cnbb members can participate for free from the event 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:00.650
 and still take two companion 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:05.460
