00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:06.210
 welcome to grandma's recipes 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:09.599
 today to make Tuscan friends with mushrooms 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:13.639
 mixed sautéed ingredients are between two 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:17.699
 people 300 g of sautéed mushrooms 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:21.000
 160 grams of Tuscan sici among which you have 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:24.660
 grated pecorino cheese and salt as i 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.570
 Tuscan PCs are a typical pasta of the 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:30.000
 province of siena and are spent of 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:33.120
 spaghetti with a raw surface e 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.780
 the humble may indeed be will have 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.969
 bronze drawn and left to dry 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:41.399
 they are very simply prepared with 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:45.030
 durum wheat semolina and set with 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:48.690
 water in this recipe and ordered e 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:51.980
 mushrooms and kohler alp and the result the 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:55.379
 very tasty and inviting first course 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:57.390
 prepare the sautéed mixed mushrooms as 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:00.329
 from the video recipe I put funds fesr 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:03.239
 drilled and then moved there in one 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:05.939
 pan rather large and indeed adherent 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:09.930
 in the meantime put one on the fire 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:12.750
 pot with plenty of water and bring to 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:17.159
 boil and then combine once 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:19.560
 water we cannot our children and them 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:22.080
 let it cook al dente 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:26.159
 during cooking we take a couple of 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:31.040
 water ladles of pasta pour out 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:31.040
 in the pan with the mushrooms 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:44.010
 but runs different PCs down in the 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:48.710
 pan with which to release flavor 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:48.710
 for a few minutes at medium-high heat 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:55.740
 at this point we sprinkle with the 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:59.509
 grated pecorino and leave 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.509
 stir for a minute 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.000
 at this point it was not there 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.570
 because it will mark the fire nor go into it 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.570
 to place 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:23.620
 our dish is ready, it doesn't stay 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:26.830
 what to bring to the table than to taste it 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:30.900
 enjoy your meal and the next recipe up
