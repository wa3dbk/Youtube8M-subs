to title lists this associates the input

00:00:22.159 --> 00:00:26.679 
to title lists this associates the input

value of list is the same as the ID of
the<00:00:29.569> data<00:00:29.810> list<00:00:32.320> inside<00:00:33.320> the<00:00:33.620> data<00:00:33.890> list

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:34.190 
the data list inside the data list

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:37.060 
the data list inside the data list
element<00:00:34.699> are<00:00:34.910> three<00:00:35.570> option<00:00:36.170> tags<00:00:36.469> you'll

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:37.070 
element are three option tags you'll

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:38.830 
element are three option tags you'll
probably<00:00:37.280> recognize<00:00:37.550> the<00:00:38.090> option<00:00:38.420> tag<00:00:38.629> from

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:38.840 
probably recognize the option tag from

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.020 
probably recognize the option tag from
select<00:00:39.230> menus<00:00:39.649> the<00:00:39.980> only<00:00:40.190> difference<00:00:40.640> is<00:00:40.820> that

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:41.030 
select menus the only difference is that

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:43.479 
select menus the only difference is that
there's<00:00:41.239> no<00:00:41.420> closing<00:00:41.840> tag<00:00:42.320> or<00:00:42.739> text<00:00:43.280> in<00:00:43.399> the

00:00:43.479 --> 00:00:43.489 
there's no closing tag or text in the

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:46.090 
there's no closing tag or text in the
option<00:00:43.820> tags<00:00:44.120> so<00:00:44.750> what<00:00:44.929> does<00:00:45.109> this<00:00:45.289> do<00:00:45.620> let's

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:46.100 
option tags so what does this do let's

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:47.919 
option tags so what does this do let's
take<00:00:46.370> a<00:00:46.399> look<00:00:46.640> in<00:00:46.789> opera<00:00:47.210> which<00:00:47.359> tends<00:00:47.660> to<00:00:47.809> be

00:00:47.919 --> 00:00:47.929 
take a look in opera which tends to be

00:00:47.929 --> 00:00:50.290 
take a look in opera which tends to be
the<00:00:48.170> earliest<00:00:48.589> adopter<00:00:49.219> of<00:00:49.250> new<00:00:49.609> html5

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:50.300 
the earliest adopter of new html5

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:54.910 
the earliest adopter of new html5
features<00:00:51.079> as<00:00:52.809> you<00:00:53.809> can<00:00:54.109> see<00:00:54.320> it<00:00:54.440> looks<00:00:54.679> just

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:54.920 
features as you can see it looks just

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.189 
features as you can see it looks just
like<00:00:55.100> an<00:00:55.280> ordinary<00:00:55.489> text<00:00:56.120> input<00:00:56.449> field<00:00:56.780> but<00:00:57.079> as

00:00:57.189 --> 00:00:57.199 
like an ordinary text input field but as

00:00:57.199 --> 00:00:59.169 
like an ordinary text input field but as
soon<00:00:57.350> as<00:00:57.440> I<00:00:57.530> put<00:00:57.710> the<00:00:57.859> focus<00:00:58.249> inside<00:00:58.670> the<00:00:58.910> field

00:00:59.169 --> 00:00:59.179 
soon as I put the focus inside the field

00:00:59.179 --> 00:01:01.810 
soon as I put the focus inside the field
it<00:00:59.539> displays<00:01:00.230> a<00:01:00.260> list<00:01:00.620> which<00:01:01.249> comes<00:01:01.550> from<00:01:01.730> the

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:01.820 
it displays a list which comes from the

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:07.960 
it displays a list which comes from the
data<00:01:01.969> list<00:01:02.359> so<00:01:02.719> I<00:01:02.749> can<00:01:02.839> choose<00:01:03.260> miss<00:01:05.890> or<00:01:06.890> mr.<00:01:07.460> or

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:07.970 
data list so I can choose miss or mr. or

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:09.880 
data list so I can choose miss or mr. or
I<00:01:08.000> can<00:01:08.390> put<00:01:08.600> in<00:01:08.780> a<00:01:08.960> completely<00:01:09.680> different

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:09.890 
I can put in a completely different

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.030 
I can put in a completely different
value<00:01:10.490> I've<00:01:10.670> made<00:01:11.420> myself<00:01:11.600> a<00:01:11.930> doctor<00:01:12.290> so

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:13.040 
value I've made myself a doctor so

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:14.830 
value I've made myself a doctor so
that's<00:01:13.190> the<00:01:13.400> way<00:01:13.550> in<00:01:13.820> which<00:01:14.030> the<00:01:14.300> data<00:01:14.480> list

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:14.840 
that's the way in which the data list

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.350 
that's the way in which the data list
works<00:01:15.250> unfortunately<00:01:16.250> opera<00:01:16.700> is<00:01:16.850> still<00:01:17.180> the

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:17.360 
works unfortunately opera is still the

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.390 
works unfortunately opera is still the
only<00:01:17.630> browser<00:01:17.900> that<00:01:18.230> supports<00:01:18.290> data<00:01:19.100> lists

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:19.400 
only browser that supports data lists

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.850 
only browser that supports data lists
like<00:01:19.640> this<00:01:19.670> so<00:01:20.600> if<00:01:20.720> you<00:01:20.870> associate<00:01:21.380> a<00:01:21.470> data

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:21.860 
like this so if you associate a data

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:23.860 
like this so if you associate a data
list<00:01:22.160> with<00:01:22.460> a<00:01:22.490> text<00:01:22.940> input<00:01:23.120> field<00:01:23.600> other

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:23.870 
list with a text input field other

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:25.900 
list with a text input field other
browsers<00:01:24.470> ignore<00:01:24.830> the<00:01:24.950> preset<00:01:25.430> options

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:25.910 
browsers ignore the preset options

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:28.090 
browsers ignore the preset options
that's<00:01:26.300> okay<00:01:26.840> but<00:01:27.110> to<00:01:27.230> make<00:01:27.380> your<00:01:27.560> forms<00:01:27.950> as

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:28.100 
that's okay but to make your forms as

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.160 
that's okay but to make your forms as
usable<00:01:28.580> as<00:01:28.700> possible<00:01:28.790> it's<00:01:29.450> often<00:01:29.780> advisable

this<00:01:49.220> is<00:01:49.400> how<00:01:49.520> it's<00:01:49.700> done

in this page I've got a select menu and

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:58.840 
in this page I've got a select menu and
a<00:01:56.180> text<00:01:56.690> input<00:01:56.870> field<00:01:57.410> let's<00:01:58.220> look<00:01:58.430> at<00:01:58.520> it<00:01:58.670> in

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:58.850 
a text input field let's look at it in

00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:58.400 
processing scripts use the name

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:01.180 
processing scripts use the name
attribute<00:03:58.640> to<00:03:59.540> identify<00:04:00.170> the<00:04:00.230> selected<00:04:00.800> value

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:06.470 
from the Select menu it's sent with the

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:09.100 
from the Select menu it's sent with the
form<00:04:06.709> data<00:04:06.950> as<00:04:07.220> title<00:04:07.670> but<00:04:08.269> if<00:04:08.390> the<00:04:08.540> text<00:04:08.900> field

is used instead that value is sent as
title<00:04:12.170> and<00:04:12.430> finally<00:04:13.430> we<00:04:13.580> need<00:04:13.730> to<00:04:13.790> associate

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:14.480 
title and finally we need to associate

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:16.870 
title and finally we need to associate
the<00:04:14.660> text<00:04:15.019> input<00:04:15.200> field<00:04:15.709> with<00:04:16.070> the<00:04:16.310> data<00:04:16.519> list

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:16.880 
the text input field with the data list

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:21.370 
the text input field with the data list
so<00:04:17.660> insert<00:04:18.470> the<00:04:18.799> list<00:04:19.430> attribute<00:04:20.390> and<00:04:20.630> set<00:04:21.200> it

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:21.380 
so insert the list attribute and set it

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:27.090 
so insert the list attribute and set it
to<00:04:22.150> title<00:04:23.150> list<00:04:23.720> and<00:04:24.110> then<00:04:24.260> save<00:04:24.620> the<00:04:24.650> page

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:27.100 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:29.460 

there's<00:04:28.100> just<00:04:28.280> one<00:04:28.460> thing<00:04:28.669> I<00:04:28.729> need<00:04:28.880> to<00:04:29.000> point

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:29.470 
there's just one thing I need to point

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:31.440 
there's just one thing I need to point
before<00:04:29.830> we<00:04:29.920> test<00:04:30.190> the<00:04:30.340> page<00:04:30.550> in<00:04:30.730> a<00:04:30.820> browser<00:04:30.970> and
