00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:05.011
 Shut! 

00:00:11.426 --> 00:00:13.079
 Hi, what's up? 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:17.216
 -Ian -What? 

00:00:17.476 --> 00:00:20.563
 Is there a ghost in my house. 

00:00:21.444 --> 00:00:22.806
 Old man, get away from me. 

00:00:24.271 --> 00:00:25.609
 Oh yeah. 

00:00:25.973 --> 00:00:27.453
 Cute clock, ladybug. 

00:00:27.775 --> 00:00:29.654
 Thank you, old man, it's Reptar. 

00:00:36.738 --> 00:00:39.061
 You see? I told you there was a ghost. 

00:00:40.252 --> 00:00:42.178
 Anthony, I'm really getting tired ... 

00:00:42.178 --> 00:00:43.740
 of these children's games. 

00:00:43.977 --> 00:00:47.349
 We are men, and men do not get scared by noise. 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.968
 Now let's do some man things. 

00:00:49.968 --> 00:00:51.604
 Are you with me or not? 

00:00:52.123 --> 00:00:54.614
 Yes. Let's do some manly things. 

00:00:54.614 --> 00:00:56.225
 -Yes! -Yes! 

00:00:56.225 --> 00:00:58.656
 Are you Joe? -Do not. 

00:00:58.796 --> 00:00:59.809
 Ray. 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.837
 Is your character woman? 

00:01:07.587 --> 00:01:09.179
 Yes or no? 

00:01:17.263 --> 00:01:19.970
 I thought we would not play those children's games anymore. 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:21.310
 It was the ghost. 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:25.242
 I do not want to hear more about you and your stupid ghost. 

00:01:25.692 --> 00:01:28.207
 And yes, my character is a woman. 

00:01:28.207 --> 00:01:30.026
 I hate this game. 

00:01:33.741 --> 00:01:35.941
 It was Alfred, was not it? 

00:01:42.241 --> 00:01:44.629
 -Ian -Yes? 

00:01:46.833 --> 00:01:48.288
 Have you ever seen a ghost? 

00:01:49.242 --> 00:01:50.670
 Do not. 

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:56.487
 -Listen, Ian. -What? 

00:01:58.515 --> 00:02:02.046
 - Do you believe in ... - No! I do not believe in ghosts! 

00:02:03.352 --> 00:02:04.965
 I was going to ask you if you believed in fairies, 

00:02:04.965 --> 00:02:07.641
 But, if you're going to be an idiot about that, well. 

00:02:12.915 --> 00:02:13.816
 Very good very good. 

00:02:13.816 --> 00:02:14.785
 I heard it that time. 

00:02:14.785 --> 00:02:16.704
 -Seriously? -Yes. 

00:02:17.575 --> 00:02:19.341
 How do we get rid of him? 

00:02:21.092 --> 00:02:22.981
 Alright, I'm ready. 

00:02:23.593 --> 00:02:25.867
 Very well. When the ghost reveals itself ... 

00:02:25.867 --> 00:02:27.570
 Ask him what he wants from us. 

00:02:27.878 --> 00:02:28.865
 Very well. 

00:02:30.945 --> 00:02:32.366
 What am I supposed to say three times? 

00:02:32.366 --> 00:02:33.866
 Unique New York 

00:02:34.333 --> 00:02:35.914

00:02:42.713 --> 00:02:44.247
 You are not saying it well. 

00:02:44.557 --> 00:02:47.232
 I can not say it, it's like a tongue twister. 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:48.679
 You try it. 

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:53.261
 Unique New York 

00:03:04.748 --> 00:03:05.760
 What? 

00:03:12.216 --> 00:03:13.886
 You're a... 

00:03:14.547 --> 00:03:15.856
 ghost? 

00:03:15.856 --> 00:03:18.122
 I am not a thief. 

00:03:18.357 --> 00:03:19.618
 Give me all your money. 

00:03:19.618 --> 00:03:21.135
 Help. 

00:03:22.952 --> 00:03:24.961
 I was joking, I'm a ghost. 

00:03:26.557 --> 00:03:29.506
 Guys, it's fine. I am a friendly ghost. 

00:03:29.506 --> 00:03:31.757
 Then why are you persecuting us? 

00:03:31.757 --> 00:03:34.004
 What are you talking about? I was not chasing anyone. 

00:03:34.254 --> 00:03:35.688
 So what was that noisy ... 

00:03:37.591 --> 00:03:38.995
 ... what did we hear before? 

00:03:40.591 --> 00:03:42.817
 No, friend, I'll tell you what that noise was. 

00:03:42.817 --> 00:03:44.006
 I was thirsty, 

00:03:44.006 --> 00:03:46.077
 so I went to the refigerator for something from OJ. 

00:03:47.618 --> 00:03:50.086
 Then I put it back in the refrigerator ... 

00:03:50.333 --> 00:03:51.802
 and I got some orange juice. 

00:03:58.772 --> 00:03:59.752
 Wait... 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:00.731
 But what about that ... 

00:04:02.594 --> 00:04:03.936
 ... what do we hear? 

00:04:03.936 --> 00:04:05.887
 That? No no. 

00:04:06.119 --> 00:04:08.649
 An idiot left his bag in the middle of the room ... 

00:04:08.649 --> 00:04:10.084
 and I hit my finger. 

00:04:13.957 --> 00:04:15.493
 What about ... 

00:04:16.586 --> 00:04:17.759
 Wait. 

00:04:19.522 --> 00:04:20.726
 Hi Mom. 

00:04:21.083 --> 00:04:23.381
 Seriously?! I love chicken pot pie! 

00:04:23.825 --> 00:04:25.137
 Yes, I will go there soon. 

00:04:25.573 --> 00:04:26.462
 Goodbye. 

00:04:28.073 --> 00:04:29.527
 I love you too, mom. 

00:04:30.237 --> 00:04:32.270
 Very good, it was nice to have talked to you. 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:33.747
 I have to fly. 

00:04:35.585 --> 00:04:36.693
 Wait. 

00:04:37.498 --> 00:04:38.754
 What was that noise you made ... 

00:04:38.754 --> 00:04:40.221
 while we were in our sleeping bags? 

00:04:40.221 --> 00:04:41.602
 It sounded like ... 

00:04:43.902 --> 00:04:45.315
 I never made that noise.
