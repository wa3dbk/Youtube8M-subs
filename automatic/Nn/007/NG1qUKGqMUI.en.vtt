00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
players dead center in the slot so a

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.030 
players dead center in the slot so a

goalie can make their stance a little
bit<00:02:33.160> narrower<00:02:33.370> as<00:02:33.700> they<00:02:34.300> get<00:02:34.420> down<00:02:34.630> the<00:02:34.810> wing

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:34.960 
bit narrower as they get down the wing

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:37.410 
bit narrower as they get down the wing
because<00:02:35.620> the<00:02:35.920> Nets<00:02:36.130> not<00:02:36.340> as<00:02:36.520> wide<00:02:36.730> and<00:02:37.030> that
