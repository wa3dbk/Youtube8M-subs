yeah why yeah you know how to power bind

00:00:51.429 --> 00:00:53.639 
yeah why yeah you know how to power bind
the<00:00:51.999> are<00:00:52.120> if<00:00:52.239> you<00:00:52.300> continue<00:00:52.839> says<00:00:53.139> he<00:00:53.350> can't

power bind you should bind around the
hips<00:00:55.690> okay<00:00:56.199> stand<00:00:56.440> up<00:00:56.469> for<00:00:56.620> me<00:00:56.769> so<00:00:57.149> what<00:00:58.149> was

00:00:58.259 --> 00:00:58.269 
hips okay stand up for me so what was

00:00:58.269 --> 00:01:00.919 
hips okay stand up for me so what was
the<00:00:58.359> first<00:00:58.389> thing<00:00:58.870> they<00:00:59.049> did<00:00:59.109> is<00:00:59.409> a<00:00:59.440> second<00:00:59.889> row

00:01:00.919 --> 00:01:00.929 
the first thing they did is a second row

00:01:00.929 --> 00:01:02.729 
the first thing they did is a second row
they<00:01:01.929> burned<00:01:02.109> up<00:01:02.229> together<00:01:02.379> they've<00:01:02.620> got

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:02.739 
they burned up together they've got

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:04.259

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:08.770 
prop okay so we can use a walk around

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:11.160 
prop okay so we can use a walk around
principle<00:01:09.579> for<00:01:09.850> the<00:01:10.090> second<00:01:10.570> area<00:01:10.689> binding<00:01:11.079> as

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:11.170 
principle for the second area binding as

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:12.539 
principle for the second area binding as
well<00:01:11.200> as<00:01:11.469> if<00:01:11.560> I'm<00:01:11.740> the<00:01:11.890> right<00:01:12.070> hand<00:01:12.280> a<00:01:12.369> lot

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:38.399 

okay<00:01:33.630> so<00:01:35.490> if<00:01:36.490> I<00:01:36.759> go<00:01:36.939> down<00:01:36.969> onto<00:01:37.479> my<00:01:37.509> knee<00:01:37.750> on<00:01:38.350> the

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:38.409 
okay so if I go down onto my knee on the

okay so if I go down onto my knee on the
inside<00:01:38.979> is<00:01:39.310> the<00:01:39.340> right<00:01:39.609> hand<00:01:39.759> lock<00:01:40.000> and

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.270 
inside is the right hand lock and

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:41.880 
inside is the right hand lock and
there's<00:01:40.719> a<00:01:40.780> little<00:01:40.990> bit<00:01:41.109> of<00:01:41.200> a<00:01:41.259> nudge<00:01:41.500> from<00:01:41.530> the

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:41.890 
there's a little bit of a nudge from the

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:44.779 
there's a little bit of a nudge from the
front<00:01:42.130> row<00:01:42.310> I<00:01:42.490> go<00:01:42.670> back<00:01:43.000> over<00:01:43.329> my<00:01:43.479> knee

00:01:44.779 --> 00:01:44.789 
front row I go back over my knee

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:47.940 
front row I go back over my knee
I've<00:01:45.789> lost<00:01:46.479> the<00:01:46.780> mechanical<00:01:47.289> advantage<00:01:47.350> that

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:47.950 
I've lost the mechanical advantage that

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:50.429 
I've lost the mechanical advantage that
the<00:01:48.130> leaves<00:01:48.340> my<00:01:48.700> bones<00:01:48.939> give<00:01:49.390> some<00:01:50.049> note<00:01:50.289> it's

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:50.439 
the leaves my bones give some note it's

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:51.989 
the leaves my bones give some note it's
difficult<00:01:50.950> to<00:01:51.039> get<00:01:51.130> out<00:01:51.280> of<00:01:51.460> that<00:01:51.520> position

00:01:51.989 --> 00:01:51.999 
difficult to get out of that position

00:01:51.999 --> 00:01:54.929 
difficult to get out of that position
okay<00:01:52.749> so<00:01:52.810> low<00:01:53.020> you<00:01:53.079> see<00:01:53.289> in<00:01:53.380> the<00:01:53.439> books<00:01:53.820> not<00:01:54.820> so

00:01:54.929 --> 00:01:54.939 
okay so low you see in the books not so

00:01:54.939 --> 00:01:56.219 
okay so low you see in the books not so
it's<00:01:55.090> wrong<00:01:55.270> I'm<00:01:55.509> just<00:01:55.689> saying<00:01:55.869> this<00:01:56.020> is<00:01:56.079> a

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:56.229 
it's wrong I'm just saying this is a

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:59.039 
it's wrong I'm just saying this is a
different<00:01:56.710> way<00:01:56.829> that<00:01:57.100> I<00:01:57.159> would<00:01:57.630> think<00:01:58.630> you<00:01:58.780> get

00:01:59.039 --> 00:01:59.049 
different way that I would think you get

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:02.099 
different way that I would think you get
to<00:01:59.079> think<00:01:59.350> about<00:01:59.590> if<00:02:00.039> I<00:02:00.249> am<00:02:00.310> on<00:02:01.210> my<00:02:01.270> feet<00:02:01.810> as<00:02:02.049> a

00:02:02.099 --> 00:02:02.109 
to think about if I am on my feet as a

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:04.469 
to think about if I am on my feet as a
nudge<00:02:02.439> I<00:02:02.770> can<00:02:03.069> adjust<00:02:03.490> if<00:02:03.759> it's<00:02:03.909> if<00:02:04.240> it's<00:02:04.329> a

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:04.479 
nudge I can adjust if it's if it's a

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:07.529 
nudge I can adjust if it's if it's a
movement<00:02:04.749> I'm<00:02:05.289> always<00:02:05.469> able<00:02:05.799> to<00:02:06.069> adjust<00:02:06.539> what

00:02:07.529 --> 00:02:07.539 
movement I'm always able to adjust what

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:10.260 
movement I'm always able to adjust what
if<00:02:07.659> you're<00:02:07.749> on<00:02:07.810> your<00:02:07.960> knee<00:02:08.850> the<00:02:09.850> dangers<00:02:10.240> you

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:10.270 
if you're on your knee the dangers you

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:12.330 
if you're on your knee the dangers you
get<00:02:10.420> tucked<00:02:10.690> over<00:02:10.840> your<00:02:11.050> knee<00:02:11.230> you<00:02:11.860> can't<00:02:12.100> go

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
get tucked over your knee you can't go

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.340 
get tucked over your knee you can't go
up<00:02:12.510> scream<00:02:13.510> comes<00:02:13.690> back<00:02:13.870> over<00:02:14.020> view<00:02:14.230> in

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:14.350 
up scream comes back over view in

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:16.650 
up scream comes back over view in
clusters<00:02:14.770> and<00:02:14.860> people<00:02:15.520> get<00:02:15.640> damaged

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
clusters and people get damaged

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:19.260 
clusters and people get damaged
so<00:02:17.380> using<00:02:18.310> the<00:02:18.430> walk<00:02:18.580> around<00:02:18.790> ban<00:02:18.910> with<00:02:19.150> the

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:19.270 
so using the walk around ban with the

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:28.530 
so using the walk around ban with the
round<00:02:19.750> the<00:02:19.840> hips<00:02:20.020> bind<00:02:21.330> okay<00:02:27.030> think<00:02:28.030> both<00:02:28.330> feet

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540
