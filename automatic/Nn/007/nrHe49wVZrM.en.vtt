00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:07.049
 hello I am neo paul sartre to vice 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.590
 president of the national federation 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:12.420
 fishing lath species 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.019
 freshwater fish currently in 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.809
 danger 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:18.869
 it's unfortunately the guy I'm going 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:23.070
 take three examples that are very 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:29.609
 currently pregnant with salmon 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:32.910
 atlantic that of the eel is a 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:35.040
 lesser degree pike salmon 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:39.469
 Atlantic that was once very abundant 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:41.280
 in our waterways since 

00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:43.170
 industrialization and building 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:47.789
 of a large number of dam works 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:50.129
 hydroelectric sight are abundant is 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:53.280
 dramatically reduce table to 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:56.850
 point that if we take a river lover 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:59.340
 like the Loire which was famous for its 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.680
 crossed by very large salmon 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.660
 who went back to reproduce until 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.339
 in the hot allies and well now he 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.619
 only a few hundred 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.409
 whereas before they years went up 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.990
 thousands a great migrator whose 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:15.330
 cycle makes it to the east of the ocean 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:18.570
 atlantic or more exactly 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.340
 Greenland up to the heads of 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:24.210
 river basins where it breeds 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:26.490
 can no longer accomplish all of this 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.259
 course the large dams and 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.530
 great works that were built by 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:34.320
 the human hand does not allow him 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.720
 more than go back up to these areas of 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:40.460
 spawning grounds where they breed is in 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:46.409
 the past the second species the eel 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:48.299
 also a large migrator migrate him 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.070
 in the opposite direction ie is going 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:52.259
 born in the shit and carl of 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.000
 sargasses is then reassembled in our 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.520
 stream 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.680
 and in great danger while this 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.030
 species was still very abundant there 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:01.190
 a decade or two 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:04.970
 simply because there was a 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:07.880
 overfishing that occurred at the 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:12.020
 estuaries with the larvae that 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:14.959
 come aground on the beaches for 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:18.290
 go up towards the rivers 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:19.930
 this species is victims of a 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:23.180
 number of acts of poaching 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:25.940
 intensive and also overfishing 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:29.450
 coastal area given a strong 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:30.950
 valuation towards one of 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:32.870
 markets of the Far East 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:35.989
 regulatory measures have been 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:38.570
 taken which greatly reduces the 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:39.920
 period when capture is allowed very 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:42.590
 certainly they will prove 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.660
 insufficient on the part 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:46.310
 scientists 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:48.950
 he is asked for a greater requirement 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:49.580
 vis-Ã -vis this species is 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:53.450
 certainly 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:55.190
 we must be led to even forbid 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:58.850
 catch for several years 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:01.549
 the third species pike and a 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:03.350
 lesser degree in danger is the result of 

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:05.360
 deep changes in streams 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:08.180
 who removed their spawning grounds 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:13.299
 pike has the particularity of 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:16.100
 reproduce on flooded areas at the 

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:19.100
 late winter and early spring 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:23.570
 he comes to reproduce precisely on these 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:25.790
 flooded areas and the man well on him 

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:27.690
 I'm looking for the month of floods 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:30.630
 possible and name 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:33.090
 works and developments have reduced very 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:35.790
 sectors where this one is 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:38.100
 reproduced here in a few sentences 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:41.280
 and in a few shortcuts 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:42.600
 main causes of risk of 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:47.150
 disappearance of certain species 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:47.150
 fish farms to take us
