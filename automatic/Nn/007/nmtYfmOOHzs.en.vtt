 according to your file 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:31.130
 easterly winds 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:33.800
 when considering them spam 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.250
 and is that a person 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.250
 adequate conditions 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.800
 access to this 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.680
 in the fifth step 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:03.740
 April 2001 

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:06.920
 the presidential investigator of today 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.450
 I think to ask Vice President Dick Cheney about the revelations 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:11.970
 of the partners 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.970
 I did not know what should be the right questions 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:20.380
 if you attend or not important paku miku that I think that the daddies what matters the 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:21.530
 important question 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:24.540
 so you informed is very common enough 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.480
 and hopefully I signed him a recognized paper I learned that he had been 

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:30.870
 informed about it and if we can prove that the Syrian president 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:34.360
 brothers mysterious bishops of history not only exists but also 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.270
 what is a theme 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:37.620
 for example of formula 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:40.910
 I wonder if I am nor be on a radio show in Washington DC 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:46.700
 call what I called 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.930
 never before Cuba ansa 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.050
 the unit interested in the services of the young extreme 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:56.870
 so suggestive and in some of his works on it 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:59.390
 yes no passive 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:00.530
 from one of the dissenters 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.530
 and if so 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.670
 added to that would be to contribute 

00:02:11.289 --> 00:02:15.479
 you have to capture it was very significant because the first place and of course 

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:18.769
 would be confidential in your opinion could you guide what 

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:20.369
 means that they use them 

00:02:20.369 --> 00:02:23.539
 secretly grandson basically cold because this world 

00:02:24.179 --> 00:02:27.280
 believe that if the ribbon cutting fails that project 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.359
 and that is very important 

00:02:29.359 --> 00:02:32.469
 the government's disclosure of UFOs and commas 

00:02:32.469 --> 00:02:35.849
 unite with national security this service has been discussed 

00:02:36.359 --> 00:02:40.189

00:02:40.189 --> 00:02:43.189
 Russian official investigations 

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:49.579
 and other information from the white house 

00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:54.959
 I think Harry's movies 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:57.909
 training on the reality of the sag and it would be a nightmare for any 

00:02:57.909 --> 00:02:59.839
 President of the United States 

00:02:59.839 --> 00:03:03.359
 it's like being a little pregnant iquino but was ahead of the young 

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:06.829
 two goals although there was 

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:09.829
 idea that some offices to a jail 

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:18.849
 there is a terrorist conspiracy 2 2 

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:21.199
 I think all presidents 

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:24.199

00:03:25.469 --> 00:03:26.609

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:37.730
 about UFOs and Basque websites and what they can do 

00:03:43.089 --> 00:03:46.089
 reality is a situation 

00:03:49.649 --> 00:03:52.649
 for the subsistence of the system 

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:57.169
 mistake of the people but he 

00:03:57.169 --> 00:04:00.169

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:24.059
 all the advances in 

00:04:24.059 --> 00:04:25.520

00:04:36.509 --> 00:04:39.509
 the friends of the white house assured 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:43.879
 come come to more 

00:04:43.879 --> 00:04:46.840

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:02.710
 He makes the decisions and the agents rushed to clear the area 

00:05:04.569 --> 00:05:06.520
 Bush and the vice president 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:09.339
 there is a person who has 

00:05:09.339 --> 00:05:12.339
 the security forces 

00:05:13.259 --> 00:05:15.339
