know about so we're very happy to be
getting<00:04:18.380> these<00:04:18.590> things<00:04:18.829> in<00:04:18.950> title<00:04:19.219> update<00:04:19.340> 14

00:04:19.839 --> 00:04:19.849 
getting these things in title update 14

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:21.879 
getting these things in title update 14
obviously<00:04:20.299> title<00:04:20.599> update<00:04:20.719> 14<00:04:21.260> is<00:04:21.469> going

00:04:21.879 --> 00:04:21.889 
obviously title update 14 is going

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:24.279 
obviously title update 14 is going
to<00:04:21.949> be<00:04:22.099> one<00:04:22.729> of<00:04:22.879> the<00:04:23.030> biggest<00:04:23.210> updates<00:04:23.810> to<00:04:24.110> ever

00:04:24.279 --> 00:04:24.289 
to be one of the biggest updates to ever

00:04:24.289 --> 00:04:25.899 
to be one of the biggest updates to ever
hit<00:04:24.620> and<00:04:24.860> I<00:04:24.979> think<00:04:25.189> the<00:04:25.280> reason<00:04:25.310> they're<00:04:25.669> doing

00:04:25.899 --> 00:04:25.909 
hit and I think the reason they're doing

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:27.999 
hit and I think the reason they're doing
that<00:04:25.999> is<00:04:26.150> because<00:04:26.300> of<00:04:26.749> all<00:04:26.960> the<00:04:27.499> console

00:04:27.999 --> 00:04:28.009 
that is because of all the console

00:04:28.009 --> 00:04:30.159 
that is because of all the console
integration<00:04:28.669> from<00:04:29.060> next-gen<00:04:29.749> so<00:04:30.020> that's

00:04:30.159 --> 00:04:30.169 
integration from next-gen so that's

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:32.230 
integration from next-gen so that's
going<00:04:30.319> to<00:04:30.379> be<00:04:30.439> very<00:04:30.529> awesome<00:04:30.919> to<00:04:31.759> have<00:04:31.939> all

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:32.240 
going to be very awesome to have all

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:34.209
