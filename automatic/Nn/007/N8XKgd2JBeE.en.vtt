00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.860
 hello how about here the exam version 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.660
 1.3 point 2 

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:21.920
 we go with the news of this new 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.960
 update that came out yesterday 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:26.180
 The first thing we will see is that in 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:31.700
 multiplayer we have an option to 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:33.500
 hide the ip is by pressing the f1 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:35.540
 I'm not going to do it so it does not look 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:38.300
 light but good by pressing f1 then it 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:39.730
 hidden from here should be here not 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.980
 That's wrong 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:46.690
 then we are going to start a new world 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:51.070
 to see another of the novelties 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:54.190
 are very few persons are three or is already 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:56.940
 we have seen two good are not four 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:59.850
 because they have corrected two boots 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:02.570
 but well let's start by looking at the 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.159
 world 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:06.320
 we are going to have to find an area 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:08.920
 wooded 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:11.080
 we'll see 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:14.100
 well I take the opportunity to say that you can 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:17.890
 continue to recommend mods of the version 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:22.149
 1.3 points 1 because of this there is hardly 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:24.220
 none and that the big mods like the 

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:25.960
 build and the industrial craft that I know that 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:27.729
 some of you are waiting for it may be 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.590
 a little bit to do them because I want them to 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:34.429
 update to the minimum 1.3 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:35.990
 to see if they add things or not because if 

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:38.299
 no then I would have to make a video 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:42.880
 added and you know that to me the 

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:45.219
 tutorials well I like that they are well 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:48.130
 well I'm going to look for a wooded area and 

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:50.710
 now I come then well I have found 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:52.810
 a wooded area here we are going to see it 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:54.789
 another of the novelties is a change 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:58.180
 aesthetic that this block of 

00:01:54.789 --> 00:02:01.030
 wood should be up is 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:02.740
 towards the sides the branches are turned towards 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:05.380
 the sides 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:09.899
 it's pretty good little thing but good 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.899
 it's part of life 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:14.290
 we can see it also here 

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:18.180
 surely these big trees 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:19.720
 they always have branches there they are 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:23.520
 as you can see 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:27.010
 can be automatically from the side 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:28.900
 perfect good after seeing these two 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:31.570
 new the multiplayer and the 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:33.880
 the trees are the ones that explains explains two 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:36.940
 ships that have fixed the first one not 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:39.550
 is the graph you can see 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:41.770
 It works a little bit, but the first one 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:43.819
 has arranged is a pretty 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:48.230
 important 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:50.599
 happened when for example when you 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:53.680
 you got in a water circulation how 

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:58.450
 is what happened is that 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:03:01.510
 just hurting the bloc as 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:04.120
 I do not know how if you stay is inside the 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:06.099
 block then I'm lowering life 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.530
 it also happened when you put on the 

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:11.319
 same block as a player and they establish 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:12.730
 closed because it pushes us you go to the 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:13.450
 blocks and you get stuck inside if they 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:16.959
 it hurt 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:21.400
 Well, that's been fixed pretty 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:24.790
 important and the second is that when coming 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:28.230
 of the cne see many times you end up going 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:28.230
 falling towards infinity 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:33.620
 in the dark part and tip that there is to the 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:33.620
 end of the map 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:39.140
 well it will not be that the ship came back from 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:41.410
 read and suddenly as forget we started 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:41.410
 fall 

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:45.960
 and you stayed 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:48.150
 Well, that has also been fixed 

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:50.640
 and that 's it, this is all that comes in 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:54.320
 the 1.3 point 2 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:54.320
 I'm going to start doing the snapshots 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:59.670
 if I'm going to start doing them and I do not know if 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:02.450
 I'll do last week because it was 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:07.300
 quite important about the 1.4 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:10.760
 I can make the next snapshot and 

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:12.960
 those boards and asia 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:15.510
 I save a video 

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:18.210
 and I hope you liked the 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:20.040
 video the news and that you subscribe 

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:22.460
 light favorites and until the next 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:22.460
 video
