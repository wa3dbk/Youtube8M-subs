well in our prior segment we were

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.310 
well in our prior segment we were
covering<00:00:20.189> primarily<00:00:20.670> the<00:00:20.789> pre-shot<00:00:21.210> routine

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
shot one is going to be the stance one

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.189 
shot one is going to be the stance one
is<00:00:29.730> going<00:00:29.880> to<00:00:29.970> be<00:00:30.150> the<00:00:30.300> bridge<00:00:30.570> and<00:00:30.900> one<00:00:31.080> is

going to be the grip so these are

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.840 
going to be the grip so these are
critical<00:00:34.110> elements<00:00:34.260> of<00:00:34.770> actually<00:00:35.219> getting<00:00:35.760> in

his body to the cue stick in relation to

his body to the cue stick in relation to
the<00:01:32.159> cue<00:01:32.340> and<00:01:32.579> he<00:01:33.360> would<00:01:33.509> have<00:01:34.020> the<00:01:34.140> cue

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
pointed at the target then he would

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.330 
pointed at the target then he would
simply<00:01:36.180> stand<00:01:36.630> next<00:01:36.840> to<00:01:36.960> the<00:01:37.079> cue<00:01:37.259> stick<00:01:37.340> to

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
simply stand next to the cue stick to

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.249 
simply stand next to the cue stick to
take<00:01:38.549> his<00:01:38.700> stance<00:01:39.000> and<00:01:39.299> either<00:01:39.630> bending<00:01:39.960> over

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
take his stance and either bending over

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.770 
take his stance and either bending over
to<00:01:40.439> the<00:01:40.560> stick<00:01:40.860> with<00:01:41.280> the<00:01:41.400> chin<00:01:41.670> or<00:01:41.909> coming<00:01:42.720> up

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
to the stick with the chin or coming up

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.410 
to the stick with the chin or coming up
like<00:01:42.990> this<00:01:43.259> so<00:01:44.009> there's<00:01:44.549> a<00:01:44.640> kind<00:01:44.939> of<00:01:45.090> two<00:01:45.240> ends

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
like this so there's a kind of two ends

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.149 
like this so there's a kind of two ends
of<00:01:45.570> a<00:01:45.630> spectrum<00:01:45.659> two<00:01:46.229> ends<00:01:46.350> of<00:01:46.439> a<00:01:46.530> rainbow<00:01:46.770> you

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
of a spectrum two ends of a rainbow you

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.370 
of a spectrum two ends of a rainbow you
have<00:01:47.549> the<00:01:47.729> frontal<00:01:48.149> approach<00:01:48.509> moving<00:01:48.990> the<00:01:49.259> cue

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
have the frontal approach moving the cue

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.469 
have the frontal approach moving the cue
back<00:01:49.590> under<00:01:49.860> the<00:01:49.979> shoulder<00:01:50.369> with<00:01:51.060> your<00:01:51.270> chin

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
back under the shoulder with your chin

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.450 
back under the shoulder with your chin
in<00:01:51.630> any<00:01:51.810> number<00:01:52.140> of<00:01:52.170> positions<00:01:52.710> and<00:01:52.890> then<00:01:53.369> you

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
in any number of positions and then you

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.340 
in any number of positions and then you
have<00:01:53.640> the<00:01:53.790> side<00:01:53.970> position<00:01:54.570> which<00:01:55.049> was<00:01:55.170> more

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
have the side position which was more

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.560 
have the side position which was more
popular<00:01:55.829> for<00:01:55.950> years<00:01:56.250> and<00:01:56.520> that<00:01:57.030> basically<00:01:57.420> was

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
popular for years and that basically was

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:58.880 
popular for years and that basically was
used<00:01:57.750> by<00:01:57.899> us<00:01:58.110> going<00:01:58.290> in<00:01:58.439> a<00:01:58.530> few<00:01:58.560> of<00:01:58.770> those

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
used by us going in a few of those

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.980 
used by us going in a few of those
players<00:01:59.159> so<00:01:59.460> so<00:02:00.030> you<00:02:00.090> basically<00:02:00.719> have<00:02:00.899> the

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
players so so you basically have the

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.910 
players so so you basically have the
option<00:02:01.320> whatever<00:02:01.590> makes<00:02:01.799> you<00:02:01.860> comfortable

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
option whatever makes you comfortable

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.069 
option whatever makes you comfortable
you<00:02:02.759> want<00:02:02.880> to<00:02:03.000> find<00:02:03.270> an<00:02:03.479> experiment

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
you want to find an experiment

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:05.499 
you want to find an experiment
experiment<00:02:04.560> with<00:02:04.829> the<00:02:04.890> frontal<00:02:05.189> position

00:02:05.499 --> 00:02:05.509 
experiment with the frontal position

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:07.580 
experiment with the frontal position
experiment<00:02:06.509> with<00:02:06.600> the<00:02:06.689> side<00:02:06.899> position<00:02:07.110> or

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
experiment with the side position or

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.199 
experiment with the side position or
anywhere<00:02:08.009> in<00:02:08.039> between<00:02:08.129> until<00:02:08.729> you<00:02:08.849> find<00:02:09.119> that

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
anywhere in between until you find that

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:10.820 
anywhere in between until you find that
you're<00:02:09.330> comfortable<00:02:09.569> now<00:02:10.289> one<00:02:10.530> of<00:02:10.560> the<00:02:10.679> ways

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
you're comfortable now one of the ways

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:11.900 
you're comfortable now one of the ways
you'll<00:02:11.009> know<00:02:11.129> you're<00:02:11.280> comfortable<00:02:11.730> is<00:02:11.819> when

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
you'll know you're comfortable is when

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.280 
you'll know you're comfortable is when
you<00:02:12.030> bend<00:02:12.239> over<00:02:12.390> on<00:02:12.599> the<00:02:12.690> shot<00:02:12.930> and<00:02:12.959> you're

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
you bend over on the shot and you're

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.700 
you bend over on the shot and you're
actually

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
actually

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.980 
actually
out<00:02:13.770> on<00:02:13.830> the<00:02:14.040> shot<00:02:14.280> you'll<00:02:15.090> find<00:02:15.420> a<00:02:15.510> position

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
out on the shot you'll find a position

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:17.750 
out on the shot you'll find a position
where<00:02:16.170> you<00:02:16.290> just<00:02:16.530> feel<00:02:16.800> like<00:02:16.830> that's<00:02:17.250> it<00:02:17.550> for

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
where you just feel like that's it for

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:18.110 
where you just feel like that's it for
you

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
you

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.610 
you
so<00:02:18.750> you're<00:02:18.990> going<00:02:19.140> to<00:02:19.170> be<00:02:19.290> a<00:02:19.320> little<00:02:19.530> bit

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
so you're going to be a little bit

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:20.960 
so you're going to be a little bit
careful<00:02:19.830> when<00:02:20.130> people<00:02:20.490> will<00:02:20.610> tell<00:02:20.790> you<00:02:20.820> it<00:02:20.910> has

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
careful when people will tell you it has

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.150 
careful when people will tell you it has
to<00:02:21.270> be<00:02:21.390> this<00:02:21.540> way<00:02:21.750> it's<00:02:22.350> really<00:02:22.680> what<00:02:22.830> has<00:02:22.980> to

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
to be this way it's really what has to

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.190 
to be this way it's really what has to
be<00:02:23.280> for<00:02:23.520> you<00:02:23.550> the<00:02:24.000> way<00:02:24.720> you<00:02:24.780> feel<00:02:25.170> comfortable

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
it goes straight through to the target

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:35.570 
it goes straight through to the target
now<00:02:33.150> there's<00:02:33.390> another<00:02:33.600> part<00:02:33.930> of<00:02:34.170> this<00:02:35.070> firm

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:11.810 
right down against the table kind of put
a<00:03:10.230> little<00:03:10.260> pressure<00:03:10.620> down<00:03:10.920> and<00:03:11.130> with<00:03:11.670> this

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:11.820 
a little pressure down and with this

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:13.520 
a little pressure down and with this
little<00:03:12.150> V<00:03:12.360> that<00:03:12.600> you<00:03:12.630> form<00:03:13.020> with<00:03:13.140> your<00:03:13.230> thumb

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
little V that you form with your thumb

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:15.650 
little V that you form with your thumb
the<00:03:14.040> acoustic<00:03:14.460> sits<00:03:14.730> right<00:03:14.940> on<00:03:15.000> that<00:03:15.210> V<00:03:15.390> just

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
the acoustic sits right on that V just

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:18.200 
the acoustic sits right on that V just
like<00:03:15.780> that<00:03:16.140> they<00:03:17.130> call<00:03:17.370> this<00:03:17.490> the<00:03:17.550> V<00:03:17.880> bridge

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:18.210 
like that they call this the V bridge

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:22.010 
like that they call this the V bridge
the<00:03:19.170> open<00:03:19.500> bridge<00:03:19.710> or<00:03:20.130> the<00:03:20.300> tower<00:03:21.300> bridge<00:03:21.630> so

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:22.020 
the open bridge or the tower bridge so

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:24.020 
the open bridge or the tower bridge so
once<00:03:22.230> again<00:03:22.380> the<00:03:22.920> hands<00:03:23.130> open<00:03:23.280> on<00:03:23.520> the<00:03:23.610> table

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
once again the hands open on the table

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:26.780 
once again the hands open on the table
the<00:03:25.020> thumb<00:03:25.260> comes<00:03:25.500> up<00:03:25.710> to<00:03:25.950> form<00:03:26.190> the<00:03:26.340> V<00:03:26.520> the

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
the thumb comes up to form the V the

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:29.060 
the thumb comes up to form the V the
fingers<00:03:27.090> are<00:03:27.240> spread<00:03:27.360> the<00:03:28.140> cue<00:03:28.350> lays<00:03:28.560> in<00:03:28.800> the<00:03:28.890> V

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:29.070 
fingers are spread the cue lays in the V

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:31.250 
fingers are spread the cue lays in the V
and<00:03:29.370> that<00:03:29.910> makes<00:03:30.120> a<00:03:30.240> nice<00:03:30.420> smooth<00:03:30.900> straight

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
and that makes a nice smooth straight

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.530 
and that makes a nice smooth straight
swing<00:03:31.620> right<00:03:31.860> through<00:03:31.890> your<00:03:32.190> target<00:03:32.580> and<00:03:32.760> then

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
swing right through your target and then

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:35.300 
swing right through your target and then
the<00:03:33.660> second<00:03:34.050> bridge<00:03:34.440> which<00:03:34.650> is<00:03:34.800> also<00:03:34.980> very

the second bridge which is also very
popular<00:03:35.550> is<00:03:35.910> the<00:03:36.630> closed<00:03:36.870> bridge<00:03:37.140> this<00:03:37.320> is<00:03:37.440> one

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
popular is the closed bridge this is one

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:39.050 
popular is the closed bridge this is one
that<00:03:37.800> most<00:03:38.130> of<00:03:38.280> the<00:03:38.370> professionals<00:03:38.940> use

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:40.350 
particularly have to shoot a little bit

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:42.650 
particularly have to shoot a little bit
harder<00:03:40.710> like<00:03:41.280> a<00:03:41.310> draw<00:03:41.640> shot<00:03:41.670> or<00:03:42.300> they<00:03:42.510> want<00:03:42.630> to

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660 
harder like a draw shot or they want to

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:43.910 
harder like a draw shot or they want to
have<00:03:42.720> a<00:03:42.810> little<00:03:42.960> bit<00:03:43.050> more<00:03:43.140> control<00:03:43.620> in<00:03:43.740> some

cases for long shots they make what's

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:47.240 
cases for long shots they make what's
called<00:03:46.170> the<00:03:46.260> closed<00:03:46.470> bridge<00:03:46.740> now<00:03:46.890> the<00:03:46.980> closed

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
called the closed bridge now the closed

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:49.460 
called the closed bridge now the closed
bridge<00:03:47.520> is<00:03:47.670> very<00:03:47.850> easy<00:03:48.000> to<00:03:48.210> do<00:03:48.390> you<00:03:49.110> start<00:03:49.380> with

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:49.470 
bridge is very easy to do you start with

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:51.650 
bridge is very easy to do you start with
your<00:03:49.620> hand<00:03:49.800> with<00:03:49.920> a<00:03:49.950> fist<00:03:50.250> on<00:03:50.400> the<00:03:50.550> table<00:03:50.730> you

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660 
your hand with a fist on the table you

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:53.780 
your hand with a fist on the table you
make<00:03:51.840> a<00:03:51.870> loop<00:03:52.200> with<00:03:52.710> the<00:03:52.890> index<00:03:53.370> finger<00:03:53.760> and

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
make a loop with the index finger and

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:55.160 
make a loop with the index finger and
the<00:03:53.970> thumb<00:03:54.090> and<00:03:54.510> put<00:03:54.660> the<00:03:54.780> two<00:03:54.930> of<00:03:54.990> them<00:03:55.080> right

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:55.170 
the thumb and put the two of them right

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:57.050 
the thumb and put the two of them right
against<00:03:55.500> each<00:03:55.620> other<00:03:55.860> just<00:03:56.100> place<00:03:56.730> the<00:03:56.910> cue

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
against each other just place the cue

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:58.850 
against each other just place the cue
inside<00:03:57.390> that<00:03:57.570> loop<00:03:57.780> and<00:03:58.050> then<00:03:58.440> spread<00:03:58.740> the

00:03:58.850 --> 00:03:58.860 
inside that loop and then spread the

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:00.830 
inside that loop and then spread the
fingers<00:03:59.220> out<00:03:59.400> and<00:03:59.700> that<00:04:00.450> gives<00:04:00.660> you<00:04:00.750> the

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
fingers out and that gives you the

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:01.970 
fingers out and that gives you the
foundation<00:04:00.990> so<00:04:01.530> in<00:04:01.620> other<00:04:01.740> ways<00:04:01.830> you<00:04:01.860> have

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:01.980 
foundation so in other ways you have

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:04.220 
foundation so in other ways you have
these<00:04:02.130> fingers<00:04:02.460> spread<00:04:02.700> out<00:04:02.970> this<00:04:03.750> finger

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
these fingers spread out this finger

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:05.420 
these fingers spread out this finger
here<00:04:04.440> you<00:04:04.560> can<00:04:04.710> sometimes<00:04:04.920> move<00:04:05.190> back

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430 
here you can sometimes move back

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:06.500 
here you can sometimes move back
underneath<00:04:05.790> to<00:04:06.060> still<00:04:06.270> give<00:04:06.390> you<00:04:06.450> a

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
underneath to still give you a

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:07.730 
underneath to still give you a
foundation<00:04:06.660> but<00:04:07.080> as<00:04:07.170> long<00:04:07.380> as<00:04:07.410> you<00:04:07.590> have<00:04:07.710> a

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:07.740 
foundation but as long as you have a

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:10.100 
foundation but as long as you have a
foundation<00:04:08.400> and<00:04:08.580> basically<00:04:09.420> the<00:04:09.660> palm<00:04:09.930> of

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:10.110 
foundation and basically the palm of

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:11.660 
foundation and basically the palm of
your<00:04:10.140> hand<00:04:10.260> is<00:04:10.560> just<00:04:10.590> right<00:04:11.280> against<00:04:11.610> the

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:11.670 
your hand is just right against the

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:13.460 
your hand is just right against the
table<00:04:12.000> as<00:04:12.090> well<00:04:12.330> and<00:04:12.600> that<00:04:12.960> gives<00:04:13.230> you<00:04:13.320> then

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
table as well and that gives you then

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:14.960 
table as well and that gives you then
that<00:04:13.650> foundation<00:04:14.190> so<00:04:14.340> once<00:04:14.520> again<00:04:14.670> it's<00:04:14.910> a

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970 
that foundation so once again it's a

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:19.970 
that foundation so once again it's a
fist<00:04:15.300> a<00:04:15.710> loop<00:04:16.710> and<00:04:16.980> the<00:04:17.820> support<00:04:18.270> fist<00:04:18.980> loop

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:19.980 
fist a loop and the support fist loop

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:22.220 
fist a loop and the support fist loop
support<00:04:20.910> and<00:04:21.120> that's<00:04:21.239> the<00:04:21.420> close<00:04:21.630> bridge<00:04:21.960> and

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:22.230 
support and that's the close bridge and

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:24.020 
support and that's the close bridge and
that's<00:04:22.620> a<00:04:22.710> very<00:04:22.890> common<00:04:23.310> bridge<00:04:23.669> you'll<00:04:23.880> see

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:24.030 
that's a very common bridge you'll see

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:25.460 
that's a very common bridge you'll see
quite<00:04:24.240> often<00:04:24.419> by<00:04:24.630> the<00:04:24.690> professional<00:04:25.230> players

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:25.470 
quite often by the professional players

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:27.080 
quite often by the professional players
and<00:04:25.770> hopefully<00:04:26.490> that's<00:04:26.640> something<00:04:26.730> you'll<00:04:27.030> be

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
and hopefully that's something you'll be

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:27.680 
and hopefully that's something you'll be
able<00:04:27.180> to<00:04:27.330> develop

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:27.690 
able to develop

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:28.910 
able to develop
your<00:04:27.840> game<00:04:28.050> it's<00:04:28.200> a<00:04:28.230> little<00:04:28.380> bit<00:04:28.470> awkward<00:04:28.650> to

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:28.920 
your game it's a little bit awkward to

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:30.680 
your game it's a little bit awkward to
begin<00:04:29.190> with<00:04:29.400> but<00:04:29.550> once<00:04:29.700> you<00:04:29.820> get<00:04:30.000> that<00:04:30.180> your

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:30.690 
begin with but once you get that your

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:31.820 
begin with but once you get that your
game<00:04:30.870> will<00:04:30.990> go<00:04:31.110> up<00:04:31.200> to<00:04:31.320> capture<00:04:31.560> a<00:04:31.590> little<00:04:31.740> bit

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:31.830 
game will go up to capture a little bit

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:34.220 
game will go up to capture a little bit
more<00:04:31.980> accuracy<00:04:32.460> in<00:04:32.550> most<00:04:32.730> cases<00:04:32.970> and<00:04:33.330> then<00:04:34.140> the

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:34.230 
more accuracy in most cases and then the

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:35.480 
more accuracy in most cases and then the
final<00:04:34.500> thing<00:04:34.620> I<00:04:34.680> want<00:04:34.830> to<00:04:34.890> talk<00:04:35.070> about<00:04:35.220> for

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:35.490 
final thing I want to talk about for
