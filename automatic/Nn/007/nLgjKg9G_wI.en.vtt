00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.790 

so<00:00:00.780> the<00:00:00.870> next<00:00:01.050> position<00:00:01.350> that<00:00:01.560> we're<00:00:01.650> going<00:00:01.740> to

00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:01.800 
so the next position that we're going to

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:03.409 
so the next position that we're going to
talk<00:00:01.979> about<00:00:02.190> after<00:00:02.669> you've<00:00:02.790> gotten<00:00:03.090> your

00:00:03.409 --> 00:00:03.419 
talk about after you've gotten your

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:06.110 
talk about after you've gotten your
stance<00:00:03.720> down<00:00:03.990> and<00:00:04.290> you've<00:00:04.589> turned<00:00:05.120> pulled

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:06.120 
stance down and you've turned pulled

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.270 
stance down and you've turned pulled
your<00:00:06.240> shoulders<00:00:06.660> back<00:00:06.930> is<00:00:07.230> the<00:00:07.649> drop<00:00:07.950> phase

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.280 
your shoulders back is the drop phase

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.089 
your shoulders back is the drop phase
and<00:00:08.639> so<00:00:09.240> this<00:00:09.690> is<00:00:09.870> the<00:00:10.050> phase<00:00:10.290> of<00:00:10.590> the<00:00:10.769> sling

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
and so this is the phase of the sling

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:16.039 
and so this is the phase of the sling
where<00:00:11.519> the<00:00:11.670> racket<00:00:12.210> goes<00:00:12.960> down<00:00:14.540> into<00:00:15.540> our<00:00:15.570> set

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
where the racket goes down into our set

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:17.510 
where the racket goes down into our set
position<00:00:16.529> here<00:00:16.710> we're<00:00:16.890> getting<00:00:17.190> ready<00:00:17.279> to

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
position here we're getting ready to

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.250 
position here we're getting ready to
start<00:00:17.730> to<00:00:17.910> the<00:00:18.000> forward<00:00:18.359> swing<00:00:18.570> and<00:00:18.840> so<00:00:19.109> the

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
start to the forward swing and so the

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.650 
start to the forward swing and so the
drop<00:00:19.619> part<00:00:19.980> of<00:00:20.160> the<00:00:20.310> swing<00:00:20.640> is<00:00:20.910> where<00:00:21.300> the<00:00:21.420> top

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
drop part of the swing is where the top

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.550 
drop part of the swing is where the top
of<00:00:21.689> the<00:00:21.900> racket<00:00:22.439> goes<00:00:23.720> downward<00:00:24.720> it<00:00:25.260> kind<00:00:25.529> of

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
of the racket goes downward it kind of

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.380 
of the racket goes downward it kind of

further as the palm starts up then the

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.870 
further as the palm starts up then the

that's an extra force that's going to

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.969 
that's an extra force that's going to
help<00:01:41.250> bring<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:42.270> racket<00:01:42.659> forward<00:01:43.110> to<00:01:43.649> give<00:01:43.829> us
