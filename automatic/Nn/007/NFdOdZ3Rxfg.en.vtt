00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
and stuff fortunately i think another

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.150 
and stuff fortunately i think another
reason<00:00:33.719> why<00:00:34.050> it's<00:00:34.079> doing<00:00:34.530> that<00:00:34.739> because<00:00:35.130> I<00:00:37.160> not

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
reason why it's doing that because I not

adjusting them you know but the real
reason<00:00:43.469> is<00:00:43.890> my<00:00:44.219> dsl<00:00:45.149> is<00:00:45.360> only<00:00:45.570> three<00:00:46.340> megabytes

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
reason is my dsl is only three megabytes
