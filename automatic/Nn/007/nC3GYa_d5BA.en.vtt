00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
they speak very formalist and now I

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.070 
they speak very formalist and now I
think<00:02:35.550> that<00:02:35.820> they're<00:02:36.090> very<00:02:36.120> clever<00:02:36.780> in<00:02:36.959> their

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
think that they're very clever in their

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:38.930 
think that they're very clever in their
dialogue<00:02:37.560> and<00:02:37.770> I<00:02:37.860> dig<00:02:38.070> that<00:02:38.250> this<00:02:38.730> show

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
dialogue and I dig that this show

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.660 
dialogue and I dig that this show
traffic's<00:02:39.570> very<00:02:40.110> much<00:02:40.410> in<00:02:40.680> what<00:02:40.950> a<00:02:40.980> gladiator

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
traffic's very much in what a gladiator

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.670 
traffic's very much in what a gladiator
show<00:02:42.000> should<00:02:42.300> be<00:02:42.450> there's<00:02:42.750> lots<00:02:43.170> of<00:02:43.380> fighting

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
show should be there's lots of fighting

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.040 
show should be there's lots of fighting
and<00:02:43.860> lots<00:02:44.160> of<00:02:44.370> violence<00:02:44.940> and<00:02:45.120> buckets<00:02:45.930> of

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
and lots of violence and buckets of

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:48.260 
and lots of violence and buckets of
blood<00:02:46.260> pouring<00:02:46.830> from<00:02:46.860> people<00:02:47.400> are<00:02:47.640> buckets<00:02:48.120> of

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:48.270 
blood pouring from people are buckets of

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:49.490 
blood pouring from people are buckets of
blood<00:02:48.450> so<00:02:48.630> that's<00:02:48.780> what<00:02:48.989> they<00:02:49.110> should<00:02:49.290> call<00:02:49.440> it

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
blood so that's what they should call it

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.860 
blood so that's what they should call it
Spartacus<00:02:50.220> buckets<00:02:50.940> of<00:02:51.090> blood<00:02:51.270> pouring<00:02:51.840> from

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
Spartacus buckets of blood pouring from

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.020 
Spartacus buckets of blood pouring from
people's<00:02:52.380> heads<00:02:52.620> which<00:02:53.250> is<00:02:53.280> okay<00:02:53.790> because

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
people's heads which is okay because

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:55.970 
people's heads which is okay because
that's<00:02:54.600> what<00:02:54.810> I<00:02:54.840> expect<00:02:55.290> from<00:02:55.380> this<00:02:55.680> type<00:02:55.950> of

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
that's what I expect from this type of

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.490 
that's what I expect from this type of
genre<00:02:56.160> of<00:02:56.670> show<00:02:56.910> but<00:02:57.870> what<00:02:58.050> I<00:02:58.080> thought<00:02:58.320> was

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
genre of show but what I thought was

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.290 
genre of show but what I thought was
really<00:02:58.680> gratuitous<00:02:59.310> was<00:02:59.489> the<00:02:59.640> sex<00:02:59.940> in<00:03:00.150> the

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:00.300 
really gratuitous was the sex in the

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:03.050 
really gratuitous was the sex in the
show<00:03:00.540> and<00:03:00.810> it<00:03:01.410> really<00:03:01.680> didn't<00:03:02.340> make<00:03:03.000> much

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
show and it really didn't make much

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:04.729 
show and it really didn't make much
sense<00:03:03.420> to<00:03:03.810> me<00:03:03.989> in<00:03:04.080> terms<00:03:04.260> of<00:03:04.500> how<00:03:04.709> it

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:04.739 
sense to me in terms of how it

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:07.040 
sense to me in terms of how it
interpolated<00:03:05.459> with<00:03:05.640> the<00:03:05.730> story<00:03:06.030> certainly<00:03:06.870> in

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.050 
interpolated with the story certainly in

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:09.229 
interpolated with the story certainly in
the<00:03:07.350> orgy<00:03:07.770> scene<00:03:08.070> Spartacus<00:03:08.880> and<00:03:08.970> his<00:03:09.030> men

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239 
the orgy scene Spartacus and his men

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:11.660 
the orgy scene Spartacus and his men
come<00:03:09.480> in<00:03:09.660> and<00:03:09.900> they<00:03:10.050> slaughter<00:03:10.410> everyone<00:03:10.830> but

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
come in and they slaughter everyone but

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:13.699 
come in and they slaughter everyone but
the<00:03:11.790> orgy<00:03:12.180> scene<00:03:12.420> goes<00:03:12.630> on<00:03:12.870> for<00:03:13.170> about<00:03:13.200> five

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 
the orgy scene goes on for about five

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:15.800 
the orgy scene goes on for about five
minutes<00:03:14.070> before<00:03:14.730> they<00:03:14.910> come<00:03:15.180> in<00:03:15.330> and<00:03:15.510> do<00:03:15.630> the

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
minutes before they come in and do the

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:17.780 
minutes before they come in and do the

it's<00:03:46.110> on<00:03:46.230> stars<00:03:46.590> but<00:03:47.160> it<00:03:47.400> transcends<00:03:48.000> it<00:03:48.090> so

00:03:48.289 --> 00:03:48.299 
it's on stars but it transcends it so

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:50.690 
it's on stars but it transcends it so
well<00:03:48.540> then<00:03:48.870> it's<00:03:49.049> now<00:03:49.230> virtually<00:03:50.160> mainstream

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700 
well then it's now virtually mainstream

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:52.819 
well then it's now virtually mainstream

flashing them to murder each other so

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:13.190 
flashing them to murder each other so
they<00:04:11.549> can't<00:04:11.790> be<00:04:11.850> all<00:04:12.120> that<00:04:12.269> sympathetic<00:04:12.630> let's

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:13.200 
they can't be all that sympathetic let's

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:14.360 
they can't be all that sympathetic let's
talk<00:04:13.350> about<00:04:13.470> the<00:04:13.650> performances<00:04:14.190> because

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
talk about the performances because

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:15.710 
talk about the performances because
certainly<00:04:14.730> as<00:04:14.850> you<00:04:14.940> mentioned<00:04:15.269> it's<00:04:15.420> a<00:04:15.480> big

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720 
certainly as you mentioned it's a big

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:17.390 
certainly as you mentioned it's a big
deal<00:04:15.870> to<00:04:15.930> replace<00:04:16.470> the<00:04:16.680> lead<00:04:16.890> actor<00:04:17.280> they

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400 
deal to replace the lead actor they

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:18.979 
deal to replace the lead actor they
replaced<00:04:17.760> Spartacus<00:04:18.390> when<00:04:18.570> Andy<00:04:18.840> Whitfield

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:18.989 
replaced Spartacus when Andy Whitfield

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:21.580 
replaced Spartacus when Andy Whitfield
passed<00:04:19.500> away<00:04:19.769> Liam<00:04:20.400> McIntyre<00:04:20.609> took<00:04:21.270> his<00:04:21.419> place

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:21.590 
passed away Liam McIntyre took his place

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:23.390 
passed away Liam McIntyre took his place
what<00:04:22.590> do<00:04:22.650> you<00:04:22.680> think<00:04:22.770> about<00:04:23.010> the<00:04:23.220> performance

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:23.400 
what do you think about the performance

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:25.159 
what do you think about the performance
because<00:04:23.700> you<00:04:23.789> obviously<00:04:23.910> have<00:04:24.630> watched<00:04:24.840> all

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:25.169 
because you obviously have watched all

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:26.120 
because you obviously have watched all
the<00:04:25.320> shows<00:04:25.349> you

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:26.130 
the shows you

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:27.680 
the shows you
you<00:04:26.160> do<00:04:26.280> a<00:04:26.310> better<00:04:26.490> comparison<00:04:26.880> than<00:04:27.150> I<00:04:27.240> can<00:04:27.480> I

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:27.690 
you do a better comparison than I can I

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:29.630 
you do a better comparison than I can I
think<00:04:28.020> Liam<00:04:28.290> McIntyre<00:04:28.440> is<00:04:28.740> a<00:04:28.860> really<00:04:29.340> hard<00:04:29.550> job

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:29.640 
think Liam McIntyre is a really hard job

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:31.760 
think Liam McIntyre is a really hard job
he's<00:04:30.450> coming<00:04:30.810> in<00:04:30.930> the<00:04:31.080> middle<00:04:31.260> of<00:04:31.320> the<00:04:31.380> second

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:31.770 
he's coming in the middle of the second

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:34.190 
he's coming in the middle of the second
act<00:04:31.890> an<00:04:32.340> over<00:04:32.610> character<00:04:33.270> hasn't<00:04:33.930> had<00:04:34.080> the

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:34.200 
act an over character hasn't had the

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:35.750 
act an over character hasn't had the
chance<00:04:34.440> to<00:04:34.650> grow<00:04:34.920> with<00:04:35.070> that<00:04:35.250> character

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:35.760 
chance to grow with that character

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:38.480 
chance to grow with that character
that's<00:04:36.180> got<00:04:36.630> to<00:04:36.780> be<00:04:36.870> really<00:04:37.200> hard<00:04:37.440> and<00:04:37.890> I<00:04:38.190> think

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:38.490 
that's got to be really hard and I think

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:40.250 
that's got to be really hard and I think
that<00:04:38.610> he's<00:04:38.760> done<00:04:39.060> a<00:04:39.330> really<00:04:39.600> good<00:04:39.780> job<00:04:39.840> of<00:04:40.050> it

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:40.260 
that he's done a really good job of it

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:47.170 
that he's done a really good job of it
supplies<00:04:40.830> be<00:04:41.760> quick<00:04:42.020> take<00:04:43.020> anything<00:04:43.320> of<00:04:43.470> value

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:47.180 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:49.580 

Spartacus<00:04:48.180> you<00:04:48.570> leave<00:04:48.780> him<00:04:48.900> naked<00:04:49.050> in<00:04:49.290> the<00:04:49.380> sun

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:49.590
