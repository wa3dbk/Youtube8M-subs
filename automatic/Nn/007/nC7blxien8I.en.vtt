00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:09.870 
it looks nice it just looks flawless on
my<00:06:05.620> face

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:09.880 

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:12.210 

I'm<00:06:10.450> quite<00:06:10.750> surprised<00:06:11.170> about<00:06:11.200> the<00:06:11.800> coverage

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:12.220 
I'm quite surprised about the coverage

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:14.880 
I'm quite surprised about the coverage
of<00:06:12.550> this<00:06:12.790> vision<00:06:13.450> because<00:06:13.810> I<00:06:14.020> was<00:06:14.230> thinking<00:06:14.650> oh

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:14.890 
of this vision because I was thinking oh

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:17.090 
of this vision because I was thinking oh
it's<00:06:15.280> still<00:06:15.700> kind<00:06:16.000> of<00:06:16.120> like<00:06:16.270> tinted

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:17.100 
it's still kind of like tinted

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:20.460 
it's still kind of like tinted
moisturizer<00:06:18.100> that<00:06:18.670> I've<00:06:18.910> been<00:06:19.180> I'm<00:06:19.750> not<00:06:20.080> even

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:20.470 
moisturizer that I've been I'm not even

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:24.750 
moisturizer that I've been I'm not even
using<00:06:20.860> it<00:06:21.310> so<00:06:22.560> so<00:06:23.560> I<00:06:23.590> think<00:06:23.800> this<00:06:24.250> is<00:06:24.490> better

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:24.760 
using it so so I think this is better

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:28.350 
using it so so I think this is better
than<00:06:25.240> any<00:06:25.960> other<00:06:26.170> BB<00:06:27.070> cream<00:06:27.280> that<00:06:27.310> I<00:06:27.520> used<00:06:27.970> and

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:28.360 
than any other BB cream that I used and

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:30.830 
than any other BB cream that I used and
I<00:06:28.600> think<00:06:28.630> it's<00:06:29.050> quite<00:06:29.260> similar<00:06:29.710> to<00:06:30.250> deflower

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:30.840 
I think it's quite similar to deflower

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:34.080 
I think it's quite similar to deflower
BB<00:06:31.840> cream<00:06:32.110> that<00:06:32.320> I<00:06:32.530> reviewed<00:06:32.980> so<00:06:33.280> that<00:06:33.580> one<00:06:33.850> is

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:34.090 
BB cream that I reviewed so that one is

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:37.020 
BB cream that I reviewed so that one is
I<00:06:34.390> think<00:06:34.690> a<00:06:34.780> little<00:06:34.900> thicker<00:06:35.380> the<00:06:36.220> flower<00:06:36.520> BB

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:37.030 
I think a little thicker the flower BB

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:39.840 
I think a little thicker the flower BB
cream<00:06:37.270> so<00:06:37.630> and<00:06:37.870> it<00:06:38.050> has<00:06:38.290> like<00:06:38.620> 1.3<00:06:39.370> fluid

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:39.850 
cream so and it has like 1.3 fluid

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:41.940 
cream so and it has like 1.3 fluid
ounces<00:06:40.300> so<00:06:40.540> usually<00:06:41.140> they<00:06:41.290> only<00:06:41.440> have<00:06:41.710> one

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:41.950 
ounces so usually they only have one

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:44.760 
ounces so usually they only have one
point<00:06:42.280> fluid<00:06:43.060> ounces<00:06:43.510> so<00:06:43.810> this<00:06:44.230> is<00:06:44.380> a<00:06:44.410> little

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:44.770 
point fluid ounces so this is a little

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:48.750 
point fluid ounces so this is a little
bit<00:06:44.950> more<00:06:45.670> product<00:06:46.830> so<00:06:47.830> from<00:06:48.070> what<00:06:48.280> I<00:06:48.310> saw

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:48.760 
bit more product so from what I saw

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:52.440 
bit more product so from what I saw
online<00:06:49.030> it's<00:06:49.720> I<00:06:50.260> don't<00:06:50.650> see<00:06:50.980> any<00:06:51.450> other

tried<00:06:56.590> before<00:06:56.770> it<00:06:57.190> has<00:06:57.370> a<00:06:57.400> lot<00:06:57.700> of<00:06:57.850> benefits<00:06:58.360> on
