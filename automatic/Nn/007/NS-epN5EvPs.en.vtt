and it's the same with welting don't

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:42.260 
and it's the same with welting don't
just<00:00:37.559> put<00:00:38.309> the<00:00:38.460> all<00:00:38.670> through<00:00:39.239> the<00:00:41.270> minimum

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
just put the all through the minimum

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:48.220 
just put the all through the minimum
amount<00:00:42.570> you<00:00:43.050> know<00:00:43.200> really<00:00:43.800> form<00:00:44.610> a<00:00:45.050> nice<00:00:46.050> hole

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:48.230 
amount you know really form a nice hole

where<00:00:49.230> you<00:00:52.340> try<00:00:53.340> to<00:00:53.840> have<00:00:54.840> the<00:00:55.079> all<00:00:57.710> go<00:00:58.710> all<00:00:58.980> the

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
where you try to have the all go all the

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.209 
where you try to have the all go all the
way<00:00:59.780> into<00:01:00.780> the<00:01:01.050> shank<00:01:01.350> where<00:01:01.680> it<00:01:01.829> starts<00:01:02.129> to

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
way into the shank where it starts to

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:07.100 
way into the shank where it starts to
become<00:01:02.600> wider<00:01:03.799> larger<00:01:04.799> diameter<00:01:05.430> and<00:01:06.110> round

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
become wider larger diameter and round

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:12.620 
become wider larger diameter and round
and<00:01:09.680> turn<00:01:10.680> it<00:01:10.830> a<00:01:10.920> little<00:01:10.950> bit<00:01:11.189> and<00:01:11.520> then<00:01:11.670> then

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
and turn it a little bit and then then

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.280 
and turn it a little bit and then then
remove<00:01:13.049> it<00:01:13.229> and<00:01:14.450> it's<00:01:15.450> a<00:01:15.600> little<00:01:15.750> more<00:01:16.080> effort

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
remove it and it's a little more effort

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:26.050 
remove it and it's a little more effort
but<00:01:16.909> it<00:01:17.909> pays<00:01:18.150> off<00:01:19.250> because<00:01:24.229> then<00:01:25.229> the<00:01:25.409> needle

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:26.060 
but it pays off because then the needle

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:32.810 
but it pays off because then the needle
goes<00:01:27.060> right<00:01:27.390> in<00:01:27.570> no<00:01:27.810> problem<00:01:30.890> and<00:01:31.890> don't<00:01:32.490> pull

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
goes right in no problem and don't pull

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.760 
goes right in no problem and don't pull
the<00:01:33.000> thread<00:01:33.299> tight<00:01:33.659> until<00:01:34.079> you<00:01:34.229> have<00:01:34.530> done

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.770 
the thread tight until you have done
both<00:01:35.070> of<00:01:35.100> them<00:01:35.310> because<00:01:36.920> you'll<00:01:37.920> you'll<00:01:38.780> mess

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.730 
made of course now that I'm on camera so
this<00:01:54.840> is<00:01:54.990> kind<00:01:55.229> of<00:01:55.290> humorous<00:01:55.759> but<00:01:57.259> at<00:01:58.259> any<00:01:58.439> rate

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
this is kind of humorous but at any rate

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.840 
this is kind of humorous but at any rate
the<00:01:59.009> point<00:01:59.250> is<00:01:59.610> still<00:01:59.909> the<00:02:00.000> same<00:02:00.329> you<00:02:00.600> have<00:02:00.780> to

the point is still the same you have to

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:46.259 
the point is still the same you have to
make<00:02:02.850> a<00:02:02.880> good<00:02:03.149> hole

00:02:46.259 --> 00:02:46.269
