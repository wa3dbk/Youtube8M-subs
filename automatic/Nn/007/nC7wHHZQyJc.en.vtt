few very basic very essential transition
techniques<00:00:08.990> first<00:00:09.990> technique<00:00:10.320> we're<00:00:10.500> going

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
techniques first technique we're going

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.259 
techniques first technique we're going
to<00:00:10.679> show<00:00:10.800> you<00:00:10.830> is<00:00:11.099> called<00:00:11.220> cutting<00:00:11.670> this

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
to show you is called cutting this

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.140 
to show you is called cutting this
transition<00:00:13.050> essentially<00:00:13.800> refers<00:00:14.160> to<00:00:14.400> cutting

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
transition essentially refers to cutting

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.239 
transition essentially refers to cutting
from<00:00:15.300> one<00:00:15.540> track<00:00:15.929> across<00:00:16.289> to<00:00:16.590> another<00:00:16.800> with

00:00:17.239 --> 00:00:17.249 
from one track across to another with

00:00:17.249 --> 00:00:19.489 
from one track across to another with
both<00:00:17.489> the<00:00:17.640> volumes<00:00:18.060> high<00:00:18.239> in<00:00:18.480> one<00:00:18.720> sub<00:00:18.989> motion

00:00:19.489 --> 00:00:19.499 
both the volumes high in one sub motion

00:00:19.499 --> 00:00:41.900 
both the volumes high in one sub motion
for<00:00:20.189> example<00:00:39.379> and<00:00:40.379> if<00:00:41.339> you<00:00:41.460> really<00:00:41.609> want<00:00:41.850> a

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
for example and if you really want a

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.790 
for example and if you really want a
while<00:00:42.089> your<00:00:42.300> crowd<00:00:42.570> you<00:00:42.870> can<00:00:42.899> get<00:00:43.199> creative<00:00:43.440> by

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
while your crowd you can get creative by

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.829 
while your crowd you can get creative by
cutting<00:00:44.160> back<00:00:44.370> and<00:00:44.609> forth<00:00:44.699> in<00:00:45.179> between<00:00:45.480> your

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:45.839 
cutting back and forth in between your

00:00:45.839 --> 00:01:13.660 
cutting back and forth in between your
two<00:00:45.989> records

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:13.670 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:23.060 

now<00:01:21.260> the<00:01:22.260> next<00:01:22.470> technique<00:01:22.710> we're<00:01:22.830> going<00:01:22.979> to

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
now the next technique we're going to

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.250 
now the next technique we're going to
show<00:01:23.190> you<00:01:23.250> is<00:01:23.460> called<00:01:23.670> fading<00:01:24.270> this<00:01:24.960> is<00:01:25.170> an

located<00:01:32.100> here<00:01:33.860> all<00:01:34.860> I'm<00:01:35.130> going<00:01:35.280> to<00:01:35.340> do<00:01:35.550> is<00:01:35.759> on

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
located here all I'm going to do is on

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:37.999 
located here all I'm going to do is on
the<00:01:36.300> cued<00:01:36.600> up<00:01:36.720> track<00:01:37.110> which<00:01:37.530> is<00:01:37.560> playing<00:01:37.860> at

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
the cued up track which is playing at

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.280 
the cued up track which is playing at
full<00:01:38.250> volume<00:01:38.460> I'm<00:01:39.030> going<00:01:39.210> to<00:01:39.270> move<00:01:39.540> in<00:01:39.840> the

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
full volume I'm going to move in the

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:41.780 
full volume I'm going to move in the
second<00:01:40.740> track<00:01:40.979> while<00:01:41.399> simultaneously

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
second track while simultaneously

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.060 
second track while simultaneously
lowering<00:01:42.509> the<00:01:42.930> track<00:01:43.229> and<00:01:43.470> keeping<00:01:43.979> the

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
lowering the track and keeping the

the<00:02:26.190> next<00:02:26.400> technique<00:02:26.550> I'm<00:02:26.880> going<00:02:27.030> to<00:02:27.090> show<00:02:27.210> you

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 
the next technique I'm going to show you

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:29.120 
the next technique I'm going to show you
is<00:02:27.480> called<00:02:27.720> the<00:02:27.750> spin<00:02:28.110> back<00:02:28.350> the<00:02:28.830> way<00:02:28.950> I<00:02:28.980> do<00:02:29.100> a

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
is called the spin back the way I do a

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.310 
is called the spin back the way I do a
spin<00:02:29.490> back<00:02:29.760> is<00:02:30.000> with<00:02:30.420> both<00:02:30.630> tracks<00:02:30.990> playing

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:31.320 
spin back is with both tracks playing

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.920 
spin back is with both tracks playing
I'm<00:02:31.680> going<00:02:31.890> to<00:02:31.950> slightly<00:02:32.400> lower<00:02:33.300> the<00:02:33.540> volume

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
I'm going to slightly lower the volume

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:35.870 
I'm going to slightly lower the volume
of<00:02:34.020> the<00:02:34.110> out<00:02:34.320> track<00:02:34.680> put<00:02:35.160> my<00:02:35.280> hand<00:02:35.520> at<00:02:35.670> ten

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
of the out track put my hand at ten

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.180 
of the out track put my hand at ten
o'clock<00:02:36.120> on<00:02:36.270> the<00:02:36.450> record<00:02:36.900> and<00:02:37.050> violently<00:02:37.860> spin

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
o'clock on the record and violently spin

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.640 
o'clock on the record and violently spin
it<00:02:38.310> back<00:02:38.490> to<00:02:38.700> give<00:02:38.850> a<00:02:38.880> twirl<00:02:39.240> sound<00:02:39.630> here's<00:02:40.530> an

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
it back to give a twirl sound here's an

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:59.600 
it back to give a twirl sound here's an
example

the next technique I'm going to show you

00:03:01.719 --> 00:03:03.780 
the next technique I'm going to show you
is<00:03:01.989> called<00:03:02.290> the<00:03:02.349> rewind<00:03:02.859> it's<00:03:03.219> similar<00:03:03.459> to<00:03:03.609> the

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
is called the rewind it's similar to the

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:05.520 
is called the rewind it's similar to the
spin<00:03:04.090> back<00:03:04.299> except<00:03:04.810> I'm<00:03:04.900> going<00:03:04.959> to<00:03:05.140> maintain

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
spin back except I'm going to maintain

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:07.470 
spin back except I'm going to maintain
the<00:03:05.709> spin<00:03:05.950> longer<00:03:06.400> by<00:03:06.760> placing<00:03:07.180> my<00:03:07.269> hand

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
the spin longer by placing my hand

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.630 
the spin longer by placing my hand
inside<00:03:08.019> of<00:03:08.079> the<00:03:08.290> needle<00:03:08.620> and<00:03:08.739> continually
