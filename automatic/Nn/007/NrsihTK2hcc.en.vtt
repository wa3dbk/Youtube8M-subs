00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:09.440 
truss rod adjustment it's just a little

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:12.789 
truss rod adjustment it's just a little
wheel<00:03:10.150> comes<00:03:11.150> with<00:03:11.330> a<00:03:11.360> little<00:03:11.720> a<00:03:12.110> little<00:03:12.500> metal

00:03:12.789 --> 00:03:12.799 
wheel comes with a little a little metal

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:16.300 
wheel comes with a little a little metal
rod<00:03:13.040> that<00:03:13.310> you<00:03:13.340> stick<00:03:13.610> in<00:03:13.640> the<00:03:13.760> wheel<00:03:13.910> and<00:03:15.310> turn

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:16.310 
rod that you stick in the wheel and turn

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:17.710 
rod that you stick in the wheel and turn
it<00:03:16.459> either<00:03:16.549> way<00:03:16.760> to<00:03:16.819> adjust<00:03:17.000> the<00:03:17.269> neck<00:03:17.480> all

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720 
it either way to adjust the neck all

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.509 
it either way to adjust the neck all
instruments<00:03:18.319> should<00:03:18.410> have<00:03:18.590> this<00:03:18.830> I<00:03:19.069> wish<00:03:19.340> they

00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:19.519 
instruments should have this I wish they

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:25.110 
instruments should have this I wish they
did<00:03:20.920> and<00:03:21.920> they<00:03:22.190> kept<00:03:22.459> the<00:03:23.150> six<00:03:23.390> bolt<00:03:23.600> neck

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.120 
did and they kept the six bolt neck

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.580 
did and they kept the six bolt neck
instead<00:03:26.120> of<00:03:26.239> the<00:03:26.299> three<00:03:26.510> bolt<00:03:26.720> neck<00:03:26.930> they<00:03:27.230> do

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:27.590 
instead of the three bolt neck they do

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:30.670 
instead of the three bolt neck they do
it<00:03:27.860> they<00:03:28.850> do<00:03:28.970> it<00:03:29.000> with<00:03:29.180> six<00:03:29.360> bolts<00:03:29.630> now<00:03:29.900> much

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:30.680 
it they do it with six bolts now much

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:33.340 
it they do it with six bolts now much
more<00:03:30.920> stable<00:03:31.540> the<00:03:32.540> next<00:03:32.780> not<00:03:33.019> going<00:03:33.170> to<00:03:33.230> move

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:33.350 
more stable the next not going to move

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:38.580 
more stable the next not going to move
around<00:03:33.500> on<00:03:33.859> you<00:03:34.070> and<00:03:35.709> they<00:03:36.709> also<00:03:36.859> have<00:03:37.359> another

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:38.590 
around on you and they also have another

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:40.509 
around on you and they also have another
another<00:03:39.590> option<00:03:39.920> that<00:03:39.950> I<00:03:40.070> forgot<00:03:40.280> to<00:03:40.340> mention

00:03:40.509 --> 00:03:40.519 
another option that I forgot to mention

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:42.880 
another option that I forgot to mention
that<00:03:40.700> they<00:03:41.000> brought<00:03:41.870> back<00:03:41.900> was<00:03:42.530> a<00:03:42.560> string

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:42.890 
that they brought back was a string

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:45.940 
that they brought back was a string
through<00:03:43.040> body<00:03:44.230> so<00:03:45.230> they<00:03:45.350> have<00:03:45.470> that<00:03:45.680> tube

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:45.950 
through body so they have that tube

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:47.680 
through body so they have that tube
which<00:03:46.250> that's<00:03:46.430> kind<00:03:46.910> of<00:03:46.940> a<00:03:47.030> different<00:03:47.420> sort<00:03:47.630> of

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:47.690 
which that's kind of a different sort of

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:55.060 
which that's kind of a different sort of
resonance<00:03:48.730> compared<00:03:49.730> to<00:03:49.970> the<00:03:51.160> regular<00:03:54.070> okay

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:55.070 
resonance compared to the regular okay

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:58.030 
resonance compared to the regular okay
so<00:03:55.130> I'm<00:03:55.430> gonna<00:03:55.549> find<00:03:56.380> roughly<00:03:57.380> flat<00:03:57.799> position

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:58.040 
so I'm gonna find roughly flat position

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:01.180 
so I'm gonna find roughly flat position
on<00:03:58.459> the<00:03:58.549> EQ<00:03:58.940> here<00:03:59.500> and<00:04:00.500> when<00:04:00.680> I<00:04:00.739> go<00:04:00.890> through<00:04:01.160> a

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:01.190 
on the EQ here and when I go through a

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:04.390 
on the EQ here and when I go through a
few<00:04:01.970> different<00:04:02.359> playing<00:04:03.290> styles<00:04:03.400> bass

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:04.400 
few different playing styles bass

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:33.540 
few different playing styles bass
starting<00:04:05.329> with<00:04:05.650> just<00:04:06.650> a<00:04:06.829> finger<00:04:07.670> style

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:33.550 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:39.670 

you

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:39.680 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:43.070 

now<00:04:40.680> I'll<00:04:40.919> roll<00:04:41.669> all<00:04:41.819> the<00:04:41.849> treble<00:04:42.270> off<00:04:42.449> and

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:43.080 
now I'll roll all the treble off and

00:04:43.080 --> 00:05:44.880 
now I'll roll all the treble off and
keep<00:04:43.319> the<00:04:43.470> bass<00:04:44.300> you<00:04:45.300> know<00:04:45.389> roughly<00:04:45.810> halfway

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:44.890 

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:46.990 

sounds<00:05:45.890> like<00:05:45.950> a<00:05:46.040> stingray<00:05:46.250> good<00:05:46.640> stingray

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:47.000 
sounds like a stingray good stingray

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:52.990 
sounds like a stingray good stingray
sounder<00:05:47.480> real<00:05:47.780> fighty<00:05:51.220> go<00:05:52.220> back<00:05:52.400> to<00:05:52.550> the<00:05:52.640> EQ

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:53.000 
sounder real fighty go back to the EQ

00:05:53.000 --> 00:06:33.200 
sounder real fighty go back to the EQ
set<00:05:53.210> roughly<00:05:53.540> flat

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:33.210 

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:35.999 

these<00:06:34.210> are<00:06:34.330> very<00:06:34.810> well<00:06:34.990> known<00:06:35.169> for<00:06:35.380> slap<00:06:35.680> style

00:06:35.999 --> 00:06:36.009 
these are very well known for slap style

00:06:36.009 --> 00:06:40.950 
these are very well known for slap style
so<00:06:36.580> I<00:06:36.610> should<00:06:36.850> probably<00:06:37.199> attempt<00:06:38.199> my<00:06:39.960> lame

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:40.960 
so I should probably attempt my lame

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:43.370 
so I should probably attempt my lame
slap<00:06:41.470> style<00:06:41.800> bass<00:06:42.130> just<00:06:42.400> so<00:06:42.490> you<00:06:42.610> can<00:06:42.759> get<00:06:42.910> it

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:43.380 
slap style bass just so you can get it

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:49.350 
slap style bass just so you can get it
yeah<00:06:45.360> get<00:06:46.360> a<00:06:46.419> chance<00:06:46.720> to<00:06:46.870> hear<00:06:47.020> how<00:06:47.169> it<00:06:47.320> sounds
