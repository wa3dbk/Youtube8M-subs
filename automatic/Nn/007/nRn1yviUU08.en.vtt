someday<00:02:25.630> I<00:02:25.780> have<00:02:26.050> enough<00:02:26.290> to<00:02:26.410> hear<00:02:26.620> that<00:02:26.650> you

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:31.950 

play<00:02:30.910> em<00:02:31.060> all<00:02:31.180> and<00:02:31.360> then<00:02:31.510> start<00:02:31.810> at<00:02:31.900> the

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:31.960 
play em all and then start at the

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:35.700 
play em all and then start at the

race<00:02:36.450> so<00:02:37.450> concepts<00:02:38.350> pretty<00:02:38.620> straight<00:02:38.830> forward

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
race so concepts pretty straight forward

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:40.890 
race so concepts pretty straight forward
or<00:02:39.670> we<00:02:39.760> press<00:02:39.970> the<00:02:40.090> play<00:02:40.300> button<00:02:40.330> we're<00:02:40.750> going

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
or we press the play button we're going

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.280 
or we press the play button we're going
to<00:02:40.960> get<00:02:41.050> a<00:02:41.110> stream<00:02:41.410> of<00:02:41.440> water<00:02:41.710> carrying<00:02:42.340> two

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290

items down to these pressure plates and

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.590 
items down to these pressure plates and
we're<00:02:48.400> just<00:02:48.610> I<00:02:48.730> don't<00:02:48.820> know<00:02:48.940> which<00:02:49.240> pressure

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:49.600 
we're just I don't know which pressure
