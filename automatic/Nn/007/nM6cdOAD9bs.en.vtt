00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
thinks that they're very strategic well

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.809 
thinks that they're very strategic well
they<00:02:35.819> can<00:02:36.150> be<00:02:36.360> but<00:02:37.250> actually<00:02:38.250> you<00:02:38.400> need<00:02:38.579> to<00:02:38.700> be

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:38.819 
they can be but actually you need to be

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:42.080 
they can be but actually you need to be
so<00:02:39.150> aware<00:02:39.420> of<00:02:39.630> this<00:02:39.900> kind<00:02:40.140> of<00:02:40.290> tactic<00:02:40.910> so<00:02:41.910> the

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
so aware of this kind of tactic so the

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:46.220 
so aware of this kind of tactic so the
threat<00:02:42.329> is<00:02:42.540> just<00:02:42.810> to<00:02:43.049> Queen<00:02:43.560> the<00:02:43.680> pawn<00:02:43.950> and<00:02:45.230> if

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
threat is just to Queen the pawn and if

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:49.490 
threat is just to Queen the pawn and if
ruk<00:02:46.560> takes<00:02:46.799> pawn<00:02:47.130> and<00:02:47.730> then<00:02:48.450> there's<00:02:49.109> this

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
ruk takes pawn and then there's this

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:53.650 
ruk takes pawn and then there's this
skewer<00:02:50.370> to<00:02:51.239> win<00:02:51.389> the<00:02:51.510> rookie

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:53.660 
skewer to win the rookie

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:57.160 
skewer to win the rookie
so<00:02:54.260> after<00:02:54.380> root<00:02:54.650> b<00:02:54.800> eight<00:02:55.690> white<00:02:56.690> is<00:02:56.870> going<00:02:57.050> to

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.170 
so after root b eight white is going to

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:00.460 
so after root b eight white is going to
win<00:02:57.380> the<00:02:58.280> black<00:02:58.490> book<00:02:58.760> but<00:02:59.660> it's<00:02:59.810> still<00:03:00.230> not

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.470 
win the black book but it's still not

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:03.820 
win the black book but it's still not
over<00:03:00.740> let's<00:03:01.100> see<00:03:01.280> how<00:03:01.460> Anand<00:03:01.880> fights<00:03:02.830> well

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:03.830 
over let's see how Anand fights well

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:06.610 
over let's see how Anand fights well
first<00:03:04.100> of<00:03:04.250> all<00:03:04.370> if<00:03:04.810> the<00:03:05.810> porn<00:03:06.080> is<00:03:06.320> Queen

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:06.620 
first of all if the porn is Queen

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:08.740 
first of all if the porn is Queen
straight<00:03:07.040> away<00:03:07.340> then<00:03:07.700> of<00:03:07.880> course<00:03:08.090> black<00:03:08.540> would

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750 
straight away then of course black would

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:12.460 
straight away then of course black would
win<00:03:08.960> flights<00:03:09.680> final<00:03:10.340> porn<00:03:10.640> so<00:03:10.990> King<00:03:11.990> b2<00:03:12.350> is

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.470 
win flights final porn so King b2 is

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:17.950 
win flights final porn so King b2 is
necessary<00:03:13.040> to<00:03:13.070> cover<00:03:13.430> porn<00:03:15.430> now<00:03:16.430> you<00:03:16.810> get<00:03:17.810> the

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:17.960 
necessary to cover porn now you get the

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:21.520 
necessary to cover porn now you get the
Queen<00:03:19.420> so<00:03:20.420> we<00:03:20.720> have<00:03:20.840> rook<00:03:21.020> important<00:03:21.350> against

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:21.530 
Queen so we have rook important against

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:24.060 
Queen so we have rook important against
Knight<00:03:21.740> important<00:03:22.220> still<00:03:22.580> not<00:03:22.820> easy

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:24.070 
Knight important still not easy

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:27.490 
Knight important still not easy
particularly<00:03:25.070> as<00:03:25.780> black's<00:03:26.780> pieces<00:03:26.900> are<00:03:27.320> very

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500 
particularly as black's pieces are very

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:31.320 
particularly as black's pieces are very
compact<00:03:28.210> black<00:03:29.210> controls<00:03:29.840> central<00:03:30.830> position

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:31.330 
compact black controls central position

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:33.520 
compact black controls central position
so<00:03:32.330> white<00:03:32.750> us<00:03:32.930> to<00:03:33.050> tread<00:03:33.260> very<00:03:33.290> carefully

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:33.530 
so white us to tread very carefully

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:37.840 
so white us to tread very carefully
we'll<00:03:34.130> ok<00:03:34.400> you<00:03:34.460> use<00:03:35.060> the<00:03:35.330> rook<00:03:36.430> from<00:03:37.430> far<00:03:37.820> away

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:37.850 
we'll ok you use the rook from far away

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:41.620

00:06:27.459 --> 00:06:27.469 
in there there's the first classical

00:06:27.469 --> 00:06:30.729 
in there there's the first classical
game<00:06:27.709> managed<00:06:28.369> manage<00:06:28.879> that<00:06:29.089> so<00:06:30.019> he<00:06:30.169> was<00:06:30.259> 18

00:06:30.729 --> 00:06:30.739

years<00:06:30.769> old<00:06:31.309> and<00:06:31.959> well<00:06:32.959> I<00:06:32.989> think<00:06:33.189> that<00:06:34.189> was<00:06:34.309> kind

00:06:34.479 --> 00:06:34.489 
years old and well I think that was kind

00:06:34.489 --> 00:06:37.949 
years old and well I think that was kind
of<00:06:34.579> a<00:06:34.669> watershed<00:06:35.029> in<00:06:35.479> their<00:06:35.869> encounters

00:06:37.949 --> 00:06:37.959 
of a watershed in their encounters

00:06:37.959 --> 00:06:41.439 
of a watershed in their encounters
Carlson<00:06:38.959> was<00:06:39.639> really<00:06:40.639> establishing<00:06:41.329> himself

00:06:41.439 --> 00:06:41.449 
Carlson was really establishing himself

00:06:41.449 --> 00:06:43.839 
Carlson was really establishing himself
at<00:06:42.110> the<00:06:42.139> top<00:06:42.619> of<00:06:42.649> the<00:06:42.829> chess<00:06:43.069> world<00:06:43.099> by<00:06:43.639> this

00:06:43.839 --> 00:06:43.849 
at the top of the chess world by this

00:06:43.849 --> 00:06:46.569 
at the top of the chess world by this
point<00:06:44.089> although<00:06:44.779> i<00:06:44.929> should<00:06:45.259> say<00:06:45.499> in<00:06:46.069> this

00:06:46.569 --> 00:06:46.579 
point although i should say in this

00:06:46.579 --> 00:06:49.389 
point although i should say in this
tournament<00:06:47.229> Grizz<00:06:48.229> shock<00:06:48.499> and<00:06:48.739> even<00:06:49.099> shook

00:06:49.389 --> 00:06:49.399 
tournament Grizz shock and even shook

00:06:49.399 --> 00:06:52.839 
tournament Grizz shock and even shook
one<00:06:50.469> Carlson<00:06:51.469> was<00:06:51.529> half<00:06:51.799> point<00:06:52.189> behind<00:06:52.369> and

00:06:52.839 --> 00:06:52.849 
one Carlson was half point behind and

00:06:52.849 --> 00:06:56.019 
one Carlson was half point behind and
then<00:06:53.149> and<00:06:53.719> half<00:06:54.139> a<00:06:54.289> point<00:06:54.499> behind<00:06:54.739> that<00:06:55.159> so<00:06:55.759> I

00:06:56.019 --> 00:06:56.029 
then and half a point behind that so I

00:06:56.029 --> 00:06:59.319 
then and half a point behind that so I
guess<00:06:56.479> that<00:06:56.839> says<00:06:57.110> something<00:06:57.319> okay<00:06:58.279> more<00:06:59.089> of

00:06:59.319 --> 00:06:59.329 
guess that says something okay more of

00:06:59.329 --> 00:07:01.509 
guess that says something okay more of
their<00:06:59.929> previous<00:07:00.199> encounters<00:07:00.889> will<00:07:01.099> be<00:07:01.219> coming

00:07:01.509 --> 00:07:01.519 
their previous encounters will be coming

00:07:01.519 --> 00:07:05.019 
their previous encounters will be coming
