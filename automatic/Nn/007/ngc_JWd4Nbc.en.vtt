00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:43.220 
point eight seconds let's assume all
right<00:04:40.850> first<00:04:41.850> I<00:04:42.150> try<00:04:42.510> it<00:04:42.570> with<00:04:42.750> the<00:04:42.840> traction

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:43.230 
right first I try it with the traction

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:46.460 
right first I try it with the traction
control<00:04:43.260> off<00:04:44.270> with<00:04:45.270> no<00:04:45.450> mechanism<00:04:46.020> between<00:04:46.169> me

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:46.470 
control off with no mechanism between me

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:47.750 
control off with no mechanism between me
and<00:04:46.590> the<00:04:46.650> power<00:04:46.860> I<00:04:47.100> thought<00:04:47.370> I'd<00:04:47.460> get<00:04:47.610> the<00:04:47.730> best

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:47.760 
and the power I thought I'd get the best

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:51.380 
and the power I thought I'd get the best
times

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:51.390 

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:54.140 

but<00:04:51.960> it<00:04:52.170> proved<00:04:52.500> all<00:04:52.800> too<00:04:53.040> easy<00:04:53.250> to<00:04:53.460> spin<00:04:53.970> the

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:54.150 
but it proved all too easy to spin the

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:59.150 
but it proved all too easy to spin the
wheels<00:04:54.330> and<00:04:54.900> the<00:04:54.990> times<00:04:55.290> were<00:04:55.530> off<00:04:55.710> the<00:04:55.920> pace

00:04:59.150 --> 00:04:59.160 

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:01.740 

so<00:05:00.160> I<00:05:00.370> decided<00:05:00.820> to<00:05:00.940> try<00:05:01.180> it<00:05:01.270> with<00:05:01.450> the<00:05:01.480> trash

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:01.750 
so I decided to try it with the trash

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:05.700 
so I decided to try it with the trash

hundred seventy what I have noticed is

hundred seventy what I have noticed is
that<00:06:38.760> I<00:06:38.910> can<00:06:39.180> break<00:06:39.480> a<00:06:39.840> bit<00:06:40.230> later<00:06:40.940> because<00:06:41.940> I'm

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:42.060 
that I can break a bit later because I'm

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:43.850 
that I can break a bit later because I'm
using<00:06:42.330> the<00:06:42.570> gears<00:06:42.810> to<00:06:42.990> help<00:06:43.200> me<00:06:43.290> slow<00:06:43.470> down<00:06:43.620> as

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:43.860 
using the gears to help me slow down as

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:45.290 
using the gears to help me slow down as
well<00:06:44.010> as<00:06:44.100> the<00:06:44.220> brakes<00:06:44.460> so<00:06:44.820> that<00:06:45.030> sort<00:06:45.240> of

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:45.300 
well as the brakes so that sort of

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:47.990 
well as the brakes so that sort of
brought<00:06:45.480> me<00:06:45.570> a<00:06:45.690> bit<00:06:45.900> more<00:06:46.080> time<00:06:46.320> at<00:06:46.530> a<00:06:46.560> time<00:06:47.000> so

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:48.000 
brought me a bit more time at a time so

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.540 
brought me a bit more time at a time so
to<00:06:48.060> try<00:06:48.330> that<00:06:48.480> on<00:06:48.540> my<00:06:48.750> second<00:06:49.140> approach<00:06:49.410> I<00:06:49.830> will

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:50.550 
to try that on my second approach I will

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:54.980 
to try that on my second approach I will
be<00:06:50.640> astonished<00:06:51.120> if<00:06:51.210> we<00:06:51.300> get<00:06:51.480> to<00:06:51.840> 1:19

00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:54.990 

00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:57.920

because when you start getting to 700
my<00:06:58.530> extra<00:06:58.860> 10<00:06:59.400> miles<00:06:59.639> an<00:06:59.789> hour<00:06:59.910> getting<00:07:00.270> that
