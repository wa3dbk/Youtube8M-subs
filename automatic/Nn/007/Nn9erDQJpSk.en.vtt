00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
predicting the longevity and vibrancy of

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.980 
predicting the longevity and vibrancy of
Ohio's<00:00:20.220> fall<00:00:20.430> color<00:00:20.670> isn't<00:00:21.000> an<00:00:21.360> exact<00:00:21.750> science

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
Ohio's fall color isn't an exact science

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.700 
Ohio's fall color isn't an exact science
but<00:00:22.830> why<00:00:23.100> the<00:00:23.160> leaves<00:00:23.520> change<00:00:23.880> every<00:00:24.150> year<00:00:24.180> is

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:24.710 
but why the leaves change every year is

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:26.750 
but why the leaves change every year is
there's<00:00:25.710> a<00:00:25.770> lot<00:00:25.950> of<00:00:26.010> science<00:00:26.370> that<00:00:26.430> goes<00:00:26.580> into

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
there's a lot of science that goes into

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.359 
there's a lot of science that goes into
why<00:00:27.330> trees<00:00:27.780> change<00:00:28.050> color<00:00:28.170> and<00:00:28.680> drop<00:00:29.190> their

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
why trees change color and drop their

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.210 
why trees change color and drop their
leaves<00:00:29.580> every<00:00:29.940> year<00:00:30.210> part<00:00:31.170> of<00:00:31.260> it<00:00:31.410> is<00:00:31.590> that<00:00:31.619> the

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:32.220 
leaves every year part of it is that the

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:33.560 
leaves every year part of it is that the
tree<00:00:32.489> needs<00:00:32.669> to<00:00:32.850> protect<00:00:33.000> itself<00:00:33.450> from

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
tree needs to protect itself from

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.020 
tree needs to protect itself from
freezing<00:00:34.230> over<00:00:34.530> the<00:00:34.650> winter<00:00:34.890> months<00:00:35.250> what<00:00:35.910> we

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
freezing over the winter months what we

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.640 
freezing over the winter months what we
see<00:00:36.239> during<00:00:36.570> the<00:00:36.720> summer<00:00:36.960> months<00:00:37.320> is<00:00:37.440> that

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:37.650 
see during the summer months is that

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:39.410 
see during the summer months is that
bright<00:00:37.980> green<00:00:38.010> color<00:00:38.610> and<00:00:38.910> that's<00:00:39.150> called

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
bright green color and that's called

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.630 
bright green color and that's called
chlorophyll<00:00:40.050> and<00:00:40.260> that's<00:00:40.920> present<00:00:41.430> in<00:00:41.489> the

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
chlorophyll and that's present in the

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.640 
chlorophyll and that's present in the
leaves<00:00:41.850> and<00:00:42.210> it<00:00:42.510> helps<00:00:42.809> produce<00:00:43.140> the<00:00:43.290> sugars

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:43.650 
leaves and it helps produce the sugars

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:46.729 
leaves and it helps produce the sugars
that<00:00:43.680> feed<00:00:44.070> the<00:00:44.250> tree<00:00:44.570> well<00:00:45.570> as<00:00:45.780> the<00:00:46.140> days<00:00:46.530> get

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
that feed the tree well as the days get

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.340 
that feed the tree well as the days get
shorter<00:00:46.800> and<00:00:47.400> cooler<00:00:47.670> the<00:00:48.450> chlorophyll

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
shorter and cooler the chlorophyll

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.590 
shorter and cooler the chlorophyll
starts<00:00:49.800> to<00:00:49.950> break<00:00:50.160> down<00:00:50.400> and<00:00:50.730> excess<00:00:51.270> sugar

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
starts to break down and excess sugar

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.840 
starts to break down and excess sugar
builds<00:00:51.900> up<00:00:52.140> in<00:00:52.290> those<00:00:52.470> leaves<00:00:52.800> and<00:00:53.490> then<00:00:53.700> you

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
builds up in those leaves and then you

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.220 
builds up in those leaves and then you
can<00:00:54.000> start<00:00:54.210> to<00:00:54.300> see<00:00:54.480> something<00:00:54.960> we<00:00:55.079> call

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
can start to see something we call

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.200 
can start to see something we call
carotenoids<00:00:55.860> which<00:00:56.160> are<00:00:56.579> the<00:00:56.670> yellows<00:00:57.030> and

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
carotenoids which are the yellows and

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.970 
carotenoids which are the yellows and
golds<00:00:57.630> which<00:00:57.750> is<00:00:57.900> particularly<00:00:58.410> present<00:00:58.650> in

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
golds which is particularly present in

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.460 
golds which is particularly present in
things<00:00:59.250> like<00:00:59.340> Sycamore<00:01:00.060> yellow<00:01:00.690> poplar<00:01:00.960> and

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:01.470 
things like Sycamore yellow poplar and

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:04.040 
things like Sycamore yellow poplar and
beech<00:01:02.370> trees<00:01:02.760> if<00:01:03.030> we're<00:01:03.390> really<00:01:03.570> lucky<00:01:03.780> we

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:04.050 
beech trees if we're really lucky we

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:05.749 
beech trees if we're really lucky we
have<00:01:04.199> a<00:01:04.229> bright<00:01:04.649> sunny<00:01:05.040> September<00:01:05.640> and

00:01:05.749 --> 00:01:05.759 
have a bright sunny September and

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:07.820 
have a bright sunny September and
October<00:01:05.899> we'll<00:01:06.899> start<00:01:07.200> to<00:01:07.320> see<00:01:07.350> some<00:01:07.649> of<00:01:07.740> those

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
October we'll start to see some of those

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.320 
October we'll start to see some of those
reds<00:01:08.070> and<00:01:08.190> purples<00:01:08.369> come<00:01:08.790> out<00:01:08.970> and<00:01:09.180> that's

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
reds and purples come out and that's

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.570 
reds and purples come out and that's
something<00:01:09.660> called<00:01:09.810> anthocyanin<00:01:10.649> and<00:01:11.009> that's

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
something called anthocyanin and that's

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.370 
something called anthocyanin and that's
actually<00:01:11.940> a<00:01:12.000> chemical<00:01:12.420> breakdown<00:01:12.600> between

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
actually a chemical breakdown between

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.440 
actually a chemical breakdown between
the<00:01:13.590> chlorophyll<00:01:14.130> and<00:01:14.340> the<00:01:14.670> excess<00:01:15.060> sugars

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
the chlorophyll and the excess sugars

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.060 
the chlorophyll and the excess sugars
and<00:01:15.630> sunlight<00:01:16.020> that<00:01:16.290> we're<00:01:16.410> experiencing

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
and sunlight that we're experiencing

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.950 
and sunlight that we're experiencing
over<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:17.759> course<00:01:18.000> of<00:01:18.180> the<00:01:18.240> fall<00:01:18.420> color<00:01:18.660> season

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
over the course of the fall color season

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.649 
over the course of the fall color season
as<00:01:19.320> the<00:01:19.619> leaves<00:01:19.860> start<00:01:20.250> to<00:01:20.490> get<00:01:20.760> more<00:01:21.060> color<00:01:21.420> in

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
as the leaves start to get more color in

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.450 
as the leaves start to get more color in
them<00:01:21.870> there's<00:01:22.320> actually<00:01:22.650> an<00:01:22.740> excess<00:01:23.159> sugar

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
them there's actually an excess sugar

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.640 
them there's actually an excess sugar
buildup<00:01:23.940> in<00:01:24.120> those<00:01:24.450> leaves<00:01:24.780> and<00:01:25.140> the

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
buildup in those leaves and the

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.350 
buildup in those leaves and the
circulatory<00:01:26.040> system<00:01:26.220> between<00:01:26.729> the<00:01:26.909> leaf<00:01:27.180> and

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
circulatory system between the leaf and

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.750 
circulatory system between the leaf and
the<00:01:27.479> branch<00:01:27.720> starts<00:01:28.290> to<00:01:28.440> slow<00:01:28.740> down<00:01:28.979> and<00:01:29.280> we

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:29.760 
the branch starts to slow down and we

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:31.250 
the branch starts to slow down and we
get<00:01:29.909> something<00:01:30.150> called<00:01:30.390> an<00:01:30.570> obsession<00:01:31.080> layer

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:31.260 
get something called an obsession layer

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.530 
get something called an obsession layer
and<00:01:31.530> that's<00:01:32.010> where<00:01:32.340> the<00:01:32.760> leaf<00:01:33.000> and<00:01:33.270> the<00:01:33.330> branch

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
and that's where the leaf and the branch

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.260 
and that's where the leaf and the branch
actually<00:01:33.840> meet<00:01:34.260> as<00:01:34.500> that<00:01:35.159> clogs<00:01:35.490> up<00:01:35.790> we<00:01:36.119> get

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
actually meet as that clogs up we get

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.330 
actually meet as that clogs up we get
extra<00:01:36.780> sugar<00:01:37.049> buildup<00:01:37.530> in<00:01:37.680> that<00:01:37.860> leaf<00:01:38.070> and

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
extra sugar buildup in that leaf and

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.820 
extra sugar buildup in that leaf and
then<00:01:39.000> when<00:01:39.210> we<00:01:39.299> get<00:01:39.420> wind<00:01:39.720> and<00:01:39.930> rainstorms<00:01:40.560> the

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:40.830 
then when we get wind and rainstorms the

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:43.430 
then when we get wind and rainstorms the
extra<00:01:41.729> weight<00:01:41.940> from<00:01:42.479> the<00:01:42.600> extra<00:01:42.900> sugar<00:01:43.080> in<00:01:43.350> the

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:43.440 
extra weight from the extra sugar in the

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:45.410 
extra weight from the extra sugar in the
leaf<00:01:43.619> will<00:01:44.159> cause<00:01:44.369> that<00:01:44.549> leaf<00:01:44.760> to<00:01:44.939> break<00:01:45.210> off

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
leaf will cause that leaf to break off

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.539 
leaf will cause that leaf to break off
of<00:01:45.450> the<00:01:45.750> tree<00:01:45.990> and<00:01:46.200> fall<00:01:46.439> to<00:01:46.619> the<00:01:46.740> ground<00:01:46.770> this

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
of the tree and fall to the ground this

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.580 
of the tree and fall to the ground this
is<00:01:47.610> a<00:01:47.760> great<00:01:48.240> time<00:01:48.570> of<00:01:48.750> year<00:01:48.780> to<00:01:49.140> do<00:01:49.260> your<00:01:49.290> fall

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
is a great time of year to do your fall

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.109 
is a great time of year to do your fall
leaf<00:01:49.830> collections<00:01:50.400> because<00:01:50.729> you<00:01:50.880> don't<00:01:51.030> have

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
leaf collections because you don't have

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.719 
leaf collections because you don't have
to<00:01:51.270> hurt<00:01:51.390> the<00:01:51.540> tree<00:01:51.720> that<00:01:51.930> way<00:01:52.460> now<00:01:53.460> that<00:01:53.490> you

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
to hurt the tree that way now that you

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.340 
to hurt the tree that way now that you
know<00:01:53.850> a<00:01:53.880> little<00:01:54.119> more<00:01:54.330> about<00:01:54.659> the<00:01:54.869> science<00:01:55.229> of

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
know a little more about the science of

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:56.840
