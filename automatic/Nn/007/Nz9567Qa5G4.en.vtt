00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:29.990 
of you guys may know mimosa cuz they are
known<00:03:27.450> as<00:03:27.480> the<00:03:27.800> shy<00:03:28.800> bashful<00:03:29.489> or<00:03:29.580> shrinking

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
known as the shy bashful or shrinking

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.250 
known as the shy bashful or shrinking
plant<00:03:30.270> if<00:03:30.540> you<00:03:30.750> touch<00:03:30.959> it

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
plant if you touch it

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:35.330 
plant if you touch it
wish<00:03:32.390> the<00:03:33.390> plant<00:03:33.660> has<00:03:34.020> a<00:03:34.440> chemical<00:03:35.040> reaction

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
wish the plant has a chemical reaction

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:38.540 
wish the plant has a chemical reaction
that<00:03:35.850> releases<00:03:35.970> all<00:03:36.720> of<00:03:36.750> the<00:03:37.110> water<00:03:37.350> from<00:03:37.650> some

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:38.550 
that releases all of the water from some

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:41.300 
that releases all of the water from some
specific<00:03:39.000> plant<00:03:39.690> cells<00:03:40.019> and<00:03:40.320> so<00:03:40.620> it<00:03:40.739> bolts<00:03:41.160> its

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
specific plant cells and so it bolts its

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.310 
specific plant cells and so it bolts its
leaves<00:03:41.519> and<00:03:41.700> really<00:03:42.030> tight<00:03:42.300> so<00:03:42.630> that<00:03:42.810> that<00:03:43.140> way

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:43.320 
leaves and really tight so that that way

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:45.530 
leaves and really tight so that that way
hopefully<00:03:43.530> whatever<00:03:44.400> animal<00:03:44.970> is<00:03:45.090> trying<00:03:45.420> to

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
hopefully whatever animal is trying to

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.390 
hopefully whatever animal is trying to
eat<00:03:45.720> it<00:03:45.870> will<00:03:46.019> go<00:03:46.170> away<00:03:46.410> it's<00:03:47.100> thought<00:03:47.370> that

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
eat it will go away it's thought that

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.280 
eat it will go away it's thought that
this<00:03:47.580> is<00:03:47.730> an<00:03:47.820> adaptation<00:03:48.000> in<00:03:48.630> case<00:03:48.810> insects

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
this is an adaptation in case insects

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.080 
this is an adaptation in case insects
land<00:03:49.530> on<00:03:49.769> it<00:03:49.950> so<00:03:50.160> that<00:03:50.310> way<00:03:50.459> if<00:03:50.670> an<00:03:50.760> insect

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
land on it so that way if an insect

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:52.970 
land on it so that way if an insect
lands<00:03:51.390> on<00:03:51.600> those<00:03:51.750> leaves<00:03:51.959> those<00:03:52.590> leaves<00:03:52.800> can

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
lands on those leaves those leaves can

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:54.380 
lands on those leaves those leaves can
pull<00:03:53.190> in<00:03:53.310> tight<00:03:53.550> and<00:03:53.670> it<00:03:53.760> can<00:03:53.880> go<00:03:54.000> nope<00:03:54.180> you're

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:54.390 
pull in tight and it can go nope you're

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:56.780 
pull in tight and it can go nope you're
not<00:03:54.510> eating<00:03:54.720> me<00:03:55.040> those<00:03:56.040> are<00:03:56.220> really<00:03:56.370> fun

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:56.790 
not eating me those are really fun

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:59.300 
not eating me those are really fun
I<00:03:56.940> love<00:03:57.239> the<00:03:57.420> mimosas<00:03:57.989> I<00:03:58.230> actually<00:03:58.769> grew<00:03:59.250> up

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
I love the mimosas I actually grew up

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:01.340 
I love the mimosas I actually grew up
with<00:03:59.550> a<00:03:59.580> whole<00:03:59.820> bunch<00:03:59.940> of<00:04:00.180> them<00:04:00.390> in<00:04:00.420> Texas

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:01.350 
with a whole bunch of them in Texas

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:02.990 
with a whole bunch of them in Texas
where<00:04:01.620> they're<00:04:01.739> considered<00:04:02.160> weeds<00:04:02.459> so<00:04:02.910> you

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
where they're considered weeds so you

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.850 
where they're considered weeds so you
can<00:04:03.120> find<00:04:03.390> them<00:04:03.510> out<00:04:03.660> in<00:04:03.750> the<00:04:03.840> yard<00:04:04.080> they<00:04:04.709> get
