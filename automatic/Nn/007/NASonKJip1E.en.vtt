00:01:04.829 --> 00:01:04.839 
ranalli it's really reminiscent of the

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:06.240 
ranalli it's really reminiscent of the
60s<00:01:05.289> would<00:01:05.440> you<00:01:05.530> say<00:01:05.649> that's<00:01:05.800> where<00:01:06.009> you<00:01:06.070> got

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:06.250 
60s would you say that's where you got

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:08.340 
60s would you say that's where you got
your<00:01:06.399> inspiration<00:01:07.060> oh<00:01:07.240> yeah<00:01:07.810> definitely<00:01:08.050> I

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:08.350 
your inspiration oh yeah definitely I

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:10.109 
your inspiration oh yeah definitely I
didn't<00:01:08.860> want<00:01:09.039> to<00:01:09.160> take<00:01:09.310> it<00:01:09.369> into<00:01:09.640> a<00:01:09.759> futuristic

00:01:10.109 --> 00:01:10.119 
didn't want to take it into a futuristic

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:12.900 
didn't want to take it into a futuristic
look<00:01:10.750> because<00:01:10.899> Ford<00:01:11.470> already<00:01:12.250> did<00:01:12.460> their<00:01:12.640> part

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:12.910 
look because Ford already did their part

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:14.880 
look because Ford already did their part
by<00:01:13.149> taking<00:01:13.479> this<00:01:13.570> far<00:01:13.780> back<00:01:14.050> to<00:01:14.259> the<00:01:14.380> 60s<00:01:14.770> as

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:14.890 
by taking this far back to the 60s as

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:17.400 
by taking this far back to the 60s as
much<00:01:15.070> as<00:01:15.220> I<00:01:15.340> can<00:01:15.580> so<00:01:16.420> essentially<00:01:17.110> what<00:01:17.350> i

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:17.410 
much as I can so essentially what i

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:19.380 
much as I can so essentially what i
wanted<00:01:17.740> to<00:01:17.800> do<00:01:18.009> was<00:01:18.310> keep<00:01:18.490> the<00:01:18.729> front<00:01:18.940> bumper

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:19.390 
wanted to do was keep the front bumper

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:21.960 
wanted to do was keep the front bumper
and<00:01:19.600> then<00:01:20.170> also<00:01:20.470> put<00:01:20.920> a<00:01:20.950> rear<00:01:21.250> wing<00:01:21.490> on<00:01:21.700> it<00:01:21.820> like

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:21.970 
and then also put a rear wing on it like

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:24.270 
and then also put a rear wing on it like
a<00:01:22.000> california<00:01:22.630> style<00:01:22.840> and<00:01:23.080> molded<00:01:23.530> in<00:01:23.710> two

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:24.280 
a california style and molded in two

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.219 
a california style and molded in two
side<00:01:24.580> skirts<00:01:24.970> and<00:01:25.149> then<00:01:25.509> do<00:01:25.660> your<00:01:25.780> upper<00:01:26.170> and

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:26.229 
side skirts and then do your upper and

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:27.840 
side skirts and then do your upper and
lower<00:01:26.289> scoops<00:01:26.740> but<00:01:27.340> it<00:01:27.460> take<00:01:27.640> it<00:01:27.759> a<00:01:27.820> step

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:27.850 
lower scoops but it take it a step

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:30.240 
lower scoops but it take it a step
farther<00:01:28.330> and<00:01:28.450> mold<00:01:28.810> them<00:01:28.930> into<00:01:29.140> the<00:01:29.439> car<00:01:29.650> so

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:30.250 
farther and mold them into the car so

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:32.219 
farther and mold them into the car so
that's<00:01:30.430> really<00:01:30.700> what<00:01:30.970> gives<00:01:31.119> this<00:01:31.360> car<00:01:31.659> that

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:32.229 
that's really what gives this car that

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:34.740 
that's really what gives this car that
muscle<00:01:32.770> look<00:01:33.009> okay<00:01:33.909> add<00:01:34.090> so<00:01:34.299> tell<00:01:34.509> us<00:01:34.540> about

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:34.750 
muscle look okay add so tell us about

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:36.810 
muscle look okay add so tell us about
these<00:01:35.049> zinc<00:01:35.470> coated<00:01:36.009> rotors<00:01:36.520> we've<00:01:36.729> never

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:36.820 
these zinc coated rotors we've never

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:38.880 
these zinc coated rotors we've never
heard<00:01:37.030> of<00:01:37.119> that<00:01:37.180> before<00:01:37.360> ok<00:01:37.960> zinc<00:01:38.290> coated<00:01:38.740> is

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:38.890 
heard of that before ok zinc coated is

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.039 
heard of that before ok zinc coated is
more<00:01:39.159> of<00:01:39.310> just<00:01:39.460> an<00:01:39.909> aesthetic<00:01:40.150> it<00:01:40.659> keeps<00:01:40.900> the

more of just an aesthetic it keeps the

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:43.710 
more of just an aesthetic it keeps the
rotor<00:01:41.290> from<00:01:41.560> rusting<00:01:42.040> it<00:01:43.000> keeps<00:01:43.270> them<00:01:43.390> shiny

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:43.720 
rotor from rusting it keeps them shiny

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:45.179 
rotor from rusting it keeps them shiny
all<00:01:43.930> the<00:01:44.049> time<00:01:44.229> so<00:01:44.380> they<00:01:44.500> look<00:01:44.680> good<00:01:44.890> and<00:01:45.070> what

see the brakes but what I did is I were
in<00:01:49.090> a<00:01:49.180> step<00:01:49.450> farther<00:01:49.720> and<00:01:49.810> i<00:01:50.170> did<00:01:50.380> a<00:01:50.409> process<00:01:51.009> on

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:51.250 
in a step farther and i did a process on

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:53.100 
in a step farther and i did a process on
it<00:01:51.400> then<00:01:51.729> it's<00:01:51.939> called<00:01:52.090> cryogenic<00:01:52.780> thermal

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:53.110 
it then it's called cryogenic thermal

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:55.380 
it then it's called cryogenic thermal
cycling<00:01:53.560> and<00:01:53.799> what<00:01:54.399> that<00:01:54.610> does<00:01:54.820> it<00:01:55.030> makes<00:01:55.270> a

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:55.390 
cycling and what that does it makes a

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:57.929 
cycling and what that does it makes a
road<00:01:55.630> or<00:01:55.780> lasts<00:01:56.049> three<00:01:56.409> times<00:01:56.439> longer<00:01:56.880> okay<00:01:57.880> so

00:01:57.929 --> 00:01:57.939 
road or lasts three times longer okay so

00:01:57.939 --> 00:01:59.429 
road or lasts three times longer okay so
tell<00:01:58.240> us<00:01:58.270> a<00:01:58.390> little<00:01:58.509> bit<00:01:58.630> about<00:01:58.869> the<00:01:59.020> engine<00:01:59.320> in
