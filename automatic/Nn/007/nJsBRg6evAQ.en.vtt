00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
 in this video i want to talk to you 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:05.790
 loose everything 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.680
 this is probably the cheapest 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.559
 superfoodie you can find and maybe 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:13.410
 in terms of nutritional value, the cheapest 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.599
 food if you look at how 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.359
 lots of nutrients you get for what 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:20.789
 you pay for it there is moss 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:23.400
 of course dutch just irish moss and 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:26.250
 is a c vegetables and 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:29.220
 Irish moss comes in this dried form 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.330
 if you opened this you get a whole one 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.820
 strong 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:36.510
 c air but when you get it 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:39.930
 going to use and grinding to one 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:42.059
 gel like this is that odorless is that 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:45.390
 tasteless and you have a great 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:48.120
 binder and a great superfood 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.850
 addition to whatever smootie you are 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.500
 makes him go much more nutritious 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.329
 to make 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:57.809
 house moss you need before you go 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:01:00.329
 Using paid first rinse 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.160
 certainly a few minutes to all the sand and 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.559
 all the salt and the like 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.479
 to rinse from the algae and tosses 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.610
 then some large picking 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:11.340
 for example, an amount such as this 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.590
 in a large container with water or put it in 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.320
 your blender fill your blender pretty full 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:20.430
 and later preferably at least half a day 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:22.439
 24 hours well in water and you 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.330
 you will see the house moss very much 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:26.430
 turn off you will see it very much 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:29.549
 much moisture and it absorbs a small amount 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:32.189
 bit weersel natural shape 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.750
 because when you would see if 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:36.659
 full-bodied plant 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:39.900
 these are really thick broad algae here 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:42.450
 movement moves in the sea 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.490
 Irish moss is very much what I mentioned 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.380
 nutritious what all kinds of not and 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.689
 minerals naturally ali in most 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.100
 leafy vegetables contain that but it contains 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:52.380
 for example also a lot of chrome 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.640
 and chrome is one of the important ones 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.079
 minerals our blood sugar 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.780
 to keep stable 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:02:01.140
 it contains a whole range of vitamins 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:03.659
 of vitamin a with vitamin k and it 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:06.479
 omega is nutritious for us and still 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:08.940
 for an additional reason namely it contains 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:11.560
 iodine too and i'm a big fan of 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.450
 iodine rich foods 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.430
 because if you stop eating 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:18.310
 bread and it refined 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:21.580
 salt where do you get your iodine 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:24.130
 from and about favors and therefore old and the 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:25.930
 bread is not rid of itself at all 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:28.569
 the best sources of 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:30.880
 from iodine and incidentally they are alone 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:33.730
 but the sea ​​vegetables such as moss and udders 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:36.280
 both iodine and iodide 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:38.680
 contained the two different forms of 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.330
 joni and you don't find that in salt and that 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:42.099
 you will not find in bread 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:44.860
 eat after six million Dutch people 

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:47.680
 too little iodine every day and with that 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:50.680
 iodine is one of the common ones 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.940
 deficits that we get as we 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.620
 become older 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:55.989
 our body has vitamins minerals 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:57.700
 needed to function properly 

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:59.980
 you know and when you will be 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:02.980
 checked for it you have enough of it 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:05.440
 within then average is taken into account 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:07.660
 how about you compared to where the 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.670
 average Dutchman and ship 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:12.130
 looked at you have enough to 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:14.709
 survive but never get a name 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:17.890
 you have looked at you are at an optimum 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:19.780
 level to be optimally healthy 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:21.820
 and get the problem with much less 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:24.519
 deficiencies for example as with 

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:27.010
 Iodine is that you are not from one to the other 

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:29.650
 the other day you notice that you don't get enough of it 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:31.660
 eat if you eat too little iodine today 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:34.060
 do you not have a symptom of one at once? 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:36.609
 iodine deficiency stronger yet you have the 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:39.280
 no symptoms of one in the coming years 

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:41.799
 iodine deficiency it takes years long before 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:44.680
 those symptoms show visibility but you 

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:45.760
 body has iodine every day today 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:46.989
 needed for the production of 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:50.019
 thyroid hormones 

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:51.190
 for the production of and from others 

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:53.859
 residents as an example growth hormone 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:55.900
 cortisol insulin all have such 

00:03:53.859 --> 00:03:58.000
 and all in iodine needed to properly 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:00.730
 able to function and also different 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.019
 Tissues in your body also store iodine 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:04.090
 on such as 

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:06.760
 and that oil is stored in the 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:08.859
 ovaries in women different 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:10.540
 organs and tissues you have someone 

00:04:08.859 --> 00:04:12.250
 necessary to function properly 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:15.730
 that is why it is very diverse 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:17.919
 mineral well because your body today 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:19.570
 iodine needs 

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:20.680
 picks up your body if you don't 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:22.280
 eat enough 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:24.380
 iodine from its own you 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:26.090
 who will put it live for you 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:28.130
 to function properly 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:30.500
 but with that your body steals from the 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:31.370
 future with the crisis of the moment 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:33.919
 to go 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:35.780
 you get out of your own for radius cultivation 

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:37.220
 of the future to deal with the crisis of the 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:39.139
 time to go namely to 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:40.820
 Today there are sufficient example 

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:42.530
 thyroid hormone is able to produce 

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:44.450
 because you need iodine for that 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:46.880
 and I'm a big fan of that 

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:49.010
 prevent you from stealing live from the 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:52.100
 future I am a big fan of mine 

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:53.810
 body stuffs make sure that I can do it well 

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:55.970
 functioning and that I have so little 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:57.770
 possible for old wants a strong 

00:04:55.970 --> 00:05:02.090
 keep the immune system very healthy 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:03.110
 stay well i started this video and that is 

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:05.180
 probably one of the cheapest 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:09.350
 superfoods is because 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:11.240
 from a small bunch of arhus moss 

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:12.620
 rinse well for a night and 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:14.990
 night week in a large container with water 

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:17.780
 throw it in the blender put the blender 

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:20.330
 and then you get with alone 

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:24.650
 but a soaked bunch of archer's moss 

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:26.840
 water you get a pudding like this in 

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:29.150
 This moss pudding is one 

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:29.960
 complete foods so nothing with it 

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:32.090
 happened 

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:34.490
 that is it came from nature and 

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:36.860
 you can keep this for a few weeks in you 

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:38.660
 fridge and what I do next 

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:40.729
 you can do it in soups when one 

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:43.370
 makes soup but you can also just make one 

00:05:40.729 --> 00:05:46.220
 teaspoon or a tablespoon of whole 

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:49.430
 throw green smoothie there so much 

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:51.169
 to extract extra minerals 

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:52.930
 again it is nutritionally 

00:05:51.169 --> 00:05:57.050
 perhaps the cheapest 

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:59.390
 food cells on earth and you care 

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:02.150
 make sure you maintain iodine stocks 

00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:03.860
 well here under this video i will 

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:05.900
 indicate how much you really need 

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:07.669
 to use enough iodine 

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:11.300
 Get that will be where you go 

00:06:07.669 --> 00:06:13.280
 You are going to show it to many people 

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:15.410
 is this also a good alternative then 

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:17.120
 compared to kelp powder because camp 

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:19.070
 mother is of course also very iodine 

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:21.440
 rich foods but it is huge 

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:23.810
 strong in taste and the udders is moss 

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:24.620
 completely tasteless you notice it completely 

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:26.780
 not in 

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:28.430
 in whatever smoothie you taste 

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:29.960
 it totally not 

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:32.150
 well i hope this is somewhat you 

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:33.900
 has given answers about the 

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:35.370
 need for iodine 

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:37.380
 how to feed your smoothie's a lot 

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:38.759
 go nailing and I'll leave you 

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:39.630
 definitely to go this sometime 

00:06:38.759 --> 00:06:42.050
 to attempt 

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:42.050
 good luck
