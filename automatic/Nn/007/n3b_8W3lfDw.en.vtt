 she even carried to undermine contaminated replacements in the world 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.820

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:57.730
 10- little bit that the chrono you will surely 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:00.700
 in reference taken back to 10 km half marathon 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:04.730
 we do not know a little better for the 10 km is the 29 of cf 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:08.719
 and for the cinema to have left ines week 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:10.820
 and 5 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.820
 does his brother's advice for running this first marathon 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:16.440
 for the moment the media 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:19.440
 aam in addition in the left hall a mission the final 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:23.440
 it was he who helped me to explain to me how it was really pushed back 

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:25.820
 by hope amines in my life 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:30.630
 and henri saivet who trains me every day struggling to a month but specified 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.410
 that this suspension contaminated 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:34.840
 bravo and congratulations 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.840
 but if you know what 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:41.320
 during the campaign the crepettes all smiles because his head spell 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:42.799
 parcels 

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:45.479
 carmine first french learned regional apart from the name a little bit of 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:50.749
 him classic among the 15 the very highest level that are more correlated 

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:51.460
 regular 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.820
 for his first marathon despite the heat is torrid managed to go 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:55.720
 until the end 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:00.900
 tf1 is partly related to al-Qaeda or head up to the 15th kilometer that I 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:03.970
 began to worry about him he still held the magnitude 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:07.090
 works ago he did a great race very happy so know him 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:08.669
 we do not recognize his older brother 

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:11.539
 who has been following him for a long time but since last year we have 

00:02:11.539 --> 00:02:14.760
 encountered by chance at the race before quite it is better 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:16.850
 he asked me 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:19.789
 and then Sunday his brother and all of them asked me to 

00:02:19.789 --> 00:02:22.119
 in fact if I wanted to take care of him 

00:02:22.119 --> 00:02:26.799
 petanque then arrives his past he's at the club and then we'll find them from 

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:30.099
 work we will take care of him seriously because I believe he 

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:30.539
 is 

00:02:30.539 --> 00:02:34.659
 he is 28 years old and he has 

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:37.279
 at the end of the week the clicked more relentlessly prepared for the 

00:02:37.279 --> 00:02:38.169
 marathon of Lorraine 

00:02:38.169 --> 00:02:41.659
 worried more prepare him for the beauty queen marathon very little 

00:02:41.659 --> 00:02:42.749
 of time because 

00:02:42.749 --> 00:02:46.259
 the place during this winter he did not do much and he started to 

00:02:46.259 --> 00:02:50.519
 train back to the moment of helping regional two notches to cc he has 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:53.779
 still makes a second at the championships de france de de cross court 

00:02:53.779 --> 00:02:58.530
 and from his grandfather started it seems a little bit percent 

00:02:58.529 --> 00:02:59.970
 for the marathon so 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:03.430
 two three four months it's at the stud and it's little for the marathon I him 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:04.300
 explained that 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:07.740
 you have to train all the honors to succeed at it really has a 

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:09.260
 marathon hold it to the end 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.280
 his feeling on this first edition to reindeer his first edition 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:13.130
 to reindeer forgiveness 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:16.010
 it's a very beautiful marathon even a good unfortunately badly placed for 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:16.750
 see 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:20.880
 for the pager temperature so has kept annals and winding is nice it 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:24.400
 hot and next year they put the militias edition on November 11th 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:25.159
 I believe that 

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:28.319
 the performance leader realized because the plateau was really 

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:31.319
 exceptional 

00:03:32.499 --> 00:03:35.709
 so we're competing at the regional second with a time of 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:38.679
 come tell me not terrible of 36 and 0 4 

00:03:38.679 --> 00:03:42.489
 of 36 57 other employees the conditions were quite difficult 

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:45.369
 but hey it's a beautiful course 

00:03:45.369 --> 00:03:48.369
 and I think next year Corsican will be in November 

00:03:49.119 --> 00:03:51.579
 it will unfold because the advantage fear 

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:54.819
 the km years is also what is good in his passes and his sons have 

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:55.959
 ratified 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:59.169
 So here I am satisfied with my performance but in the 

00:03:59.169 --> 00:04:00.819
 12 first 13 settlers 

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:03.819
 plg I managed to manage despite this morning I was 

00:04:04.409 --> 00:04:06.779
 a little sick time but hey it went well 

00:04:06.779 --> 00:04:08.859
 the current runs a marathon not so long ago 

00:04:08.859 --> 00:04:13.769
 Parisians to roll with a trélazé of 28 45 and of which little I am satisfied 

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:15.939
 of the performance note today 

00:04:15.939 --> 00:04:18.349
 even an attack and chain in a season did this year by 

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:19.129
 example 

00:04:19.129 --> 00:04:21.739
 baala today if I go to my family so 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:24.590
 the new made reality is followed place 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:28.120
 it made me happy but also schools so I had to know 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:30.499
 what I was not good this morning and then happened 

00:04:30.499 --> 00:04:32.699
 and then for the next hell 

00:04:32.699 --> 00:04:33.979
 in october-november 

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:36.559
 now i'm going to rest a little bit the task that the fund recovered 

00:04:36.559 --> 00:04:38.430
 of 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:41.410
 you do a season 3 is in which club we talk a little about you at your age 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:46.600
 what are you doing in life traveling and 40 years old I am dhaleh regions to 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:49.020
 Saint Bartholomew is all newly afp 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:51.849
 others I did last season it's a fifth of the championships of 

00:04:51.849 --> 00:04:54.490
 france veterans on veterans 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:56.719
 e the bomba did 

00:04:56.719 --> 00:04:59.689
 we have next will have no trace in all his team letters that we have a 

00:04:59.689 --> 00:05:02.259
 good team not to mention jean-michel cousteau and 

00:05:02.259 --> 00:05:06.839
 and all that what so yes it motivates me a coach who is good for me 

00:05:06.839 --> 00:05:07.939
 Christmas legs 

00:05:07.939 --> 00:05:10.909
 and that's why they're spinning and plants of animals that we can 

00:05:10.909 --> 00:05:11.589
 consider 

00:05:11.589 --> 00:05:14.509
 and that's often that now I think the weight first and foremost 

00:05:14.509 --> 00:05:18.349
 I had to train alone and I made myself the plans and I had to 

00:05:18.349 --> 00:05:21.330
 throne kicking your bag on its doors 

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:24.690
 the good recovery I held in the bars the hands of physiotherapists bercy 

00:05:24.689 --> 00:05:27.089
 come to see again 

00:05:27.089 --> 00:05:30.499
 a talent in the company of the stars of the association mama ethiopia 

00:05:30.499 --> 00:05:33.829
 the designation of not having disengaged past the first marathon ends 

00:05:33.829 --> 00:05:36.770

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:40.260

00:05:41.789 --> 00:05:45.979

00:05:45.979 --> 00:05:47.860
 English reached 

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:49.169
 amateurs 

00:05:49.169 --> 00:05:53.340
 % from people to volunteers who are there the place is 

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:58.330
 downward man or woman Arab I think that at the margin the wing was 

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:00.279
 not 

00:06:00.279 --> 00:06:02.400
 but he lacked a little talent 

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:06.190
 alalala little dallas and misses but it remains in cages I can rest 

00:06:06.819 --> 00:06:09.559
 so tell me a little bit of the break that will happen with the association 

00:06:09.559 --> 00:06:12.559
 thanks to arras the delegates and thanks to the help of the marathon 

00:06:12.559 --> 00:06:14.620
 Benjamin Saleh 

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:17.620
 yamaha despite his lift 

00:06:19.129 --> 00:06:22.379
 coadou what follows so we must not forget - I can not forget it since 

00:06:22.379 --> 00:06:23.919
 the creation of the association 

00:06:23.919 --> 00:06:25.939
 a green marathon report 

00:06:25.939 --> 00:06:29.289
 e also gave his flying pilot friendship 

00:06:29.839 --> 00:06:32.699
 yes not yet in the state made a lot of laughs 

00:06:32.699 --> 00:06:36.580
 today absences I do not know the reason I can not even start 

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:40.559
 to say for if for now but today I believe that to play the c1 

00:06:40.559 --> 00:06:42.139
 of buea 

00:06:42.139 --> 00:06:44.580
 alas a start in 2002 

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:46.059
 there is a beginning 

00:06:46.059 --> 00:06:49.509
 when the 2011 obama wine that's been a year that I believe is the future that the 

00:06:49.509 --> 00:06:51.379
 will say I can 

00:06:51.379 --> 00:06:54.509
 yes I can not go forward I think the association is doing well 

00:06:55.279 --> 00:06:58.009
 the association is doing well 

00:06:58.009 --> 00:07:01.629
 and she always has as fiercely as a beginning 

00:07:01.629 --> 00:07:04.770
 for volunteers are still as determined as before 

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:06.279
 thank you so much 

00:07:06.279 --> 00:07:07.159
 but insists
