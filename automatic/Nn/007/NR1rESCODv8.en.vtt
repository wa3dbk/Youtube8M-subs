 percent 

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:08.429
 no 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:11.219
 the 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:13.949
 for the year for now 

00:00:13.949 --> 00:00:17.189
 of course today we will talk about potting 

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:20.189
 the plant and well the big driveway to push 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:24.210
 and if in fact the small gesture of professionals ap ap 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.250
 to control fashion is by making fun of kent meyer all the roots 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.680
 starts begin to very well upholster even to turn around the 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.000
 box as the cena present 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.980
 to win it then of course 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:41.690
 in a ratio usually 3 to 4 centimeters larger diam's is 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:43.550
 more important than 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:46.550
 the local pole where m 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:52.960
 what is the relatively simple common 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.510
 it's a draining effect to put at the bottom of the pot to prevent 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:59.750
 heart the roots bathes in the back 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:02.750
 and that it's rotting we'll take care now to repot 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:05.470
 the door 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:08.470
 in his new position 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.270
 In fact, we are putting a little bit of 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:24.290
 according to analysts 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:26.920
 that's where I can walk a little too much anyway 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.240
 so I could have taken a little deeper point 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.460
 no problem we make a little room 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:32.950
 we can therefore very little 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:35.860
 and brakes fashion like that the idea 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:38.540
 it is an action that can be done especially if the plant had much more 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:41.670
 roots still we still arrive a little 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.090
 he replaces the plant 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.670
 on the bottom of the harbor 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.650
 he was an exodus movement 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:50.820
 back and forth 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.820
 by lying down the earth 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:01.330
 there is almost one yet this make a small settlement 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:04.330
 already 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:06.980
 we leave a little edge inc 

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:09.339
 accomplices after watered that the water is not flowing 

00:02:09.339 --> 00:02:10.829
 at the moment when dew 

00:02:10.829 --> 00:02:14.159
 Hamouma the money for the rest 

00:02:15.469 --> 00:02:17.429
 m 

00:02:17.429 --> 00:02:18.600
 good now see 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.090
 for daring it's important to have trees in the world for the 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.279
 first time 

00:02:23.279 --> 00:02:26.279
 as the land is ready to help and you have to go slowly 

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:29.049
 let it penetrate 

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:32.049
 of his descendants the water 

00:02:33.249 --> 00:02:35.439
 start again so 

00:02:35.439 --> 00:02:37.639
 it's been three or four times like that 

00:02:37.639 --> 00:02:41.120
 until all the whole half is the lybie the important why 

00:02:41.119 --> 00:02:42.929
 because it takes the roots 

00:02:42.929 --> 00:02:46.999
 either all the api of compacted earth of the air holes these air holes you 

00:02:46.999 --> 00:02:49.309
 have the rot that will settle 

00:02:49.309 --> 00:02:50.580
 for now porto 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:51.979
 it's the label 

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:55.019
 we find on it the date of 6025 of 3 05 

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:00.659
 the provenance and then I can very well put the date of May 6 the date of 

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:03.659
 rossi potting 

00:03:04.679 --> 00:03:08.019
 you imagine a world 

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:11.019
 trouble 

00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:21.389
 she 

00:03:22.999 --> 00:03:23.649
