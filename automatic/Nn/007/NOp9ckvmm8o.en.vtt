00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
know we need the time slowing effects

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.170 
know we need the time slowing effects
well<00:02:19.680> you<00:02:19.799> do<00:02:20.099> have<00:02:20.129> a<00:02:20.280> few<00:02:20.519> of<00:02:20.639> those<00:02:20.790> i<00:02:20.999> should

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
well you do have a few of those i should

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.479 
well you do have a few of those i should
say<00:02:21.359> but<00:02:21.540> rather<00:02:21.689> not<00:02:21.870> as<00:02:22.200> many<00:02:22.499> and<00:02:23.069> not<00:02:23.370> as

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:23.489 
say but rather not as many and not as

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:24.830 
say but rather not as many and not as
frequently<00:02:24.030> which<00:02:24.209> is<00:02:24.359> something<00:02:24.540> that<00:02:24.659> we

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
frequently which is something that we

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.209 
frequently which is something that we
really<00:02:24.870> loved<00:02:25.290> about<00:02:25.409> fruit<00:02:25.769> ninja<00:02:26.040> that's

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:26.219 
really loved about fruit ninja that's

00:02:26.219 --> 00:02:29.330 
really loved about fruit ninja that's
not<00:02:26.400> quite<00:02:26.639> as<00:02:26.879> prevalent<00:02:27.269> in<00:02:27.689> this<00:02:27.870> one<00:02:28.340> you

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
not quite as prevalent in this one you

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.220 
not quite as prevalent in this one you
know<00:02:29.430> that<00:02:29.609> is<00:02:29.730> sort<00:02:30.150> of<00:02:30.209> a<00:02:30.359> downside<00:02:30.959> but<00:02:31.079> then

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
know that is sort of a downside but then

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:32.479 
know that is sort of a downside but then
again<00:02:31.319> we<00:02:31.530> have<00:02:31.620> a<00:02:31.650> feeling<00:02:31.980> that<00:02:32.010> future

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:32.489 
again we have a feeling that future

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:35.300 
again we have a feeling that future
updates<00:02:32.790> will<00:02:32.969> fix<00:02:33.209> that<00:02:33.299> rather<00:02:33.659> quickly<00:02:34.310> so

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
updates will fix that rather quickly so

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.490 
updates will fix that rather quickly so
just<00:02:35.519> to<00:02:35.609> give<00:02:35.639> an<00:02:35.819> example<00:02:36.030> of<00:02:36.359> the<00:02:36.659> arcade

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
just to give an example of the arcade

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.459 
just to give an example of the arcade
mode<00:02:37.739> too<00:02:38.040> while<00:02:38.250> we're<00:02:38.370> edit<00:02:39.049> the<00:02:40.049> idea<00:02:40.290> here

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:40.469 
mode too while we're edit the idea here

00:02:40.469 --> 00:02:42.170 
mode too while we're edit the idea here
is<00:02:40.500> that<00:02:40.560> you<00:02:40.739> have<00:02:40.859> a<00:02:40.889> time<00:02:41.129> limit<00:02:41.310> and<00:02:41.669> you

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
is that you have a time limit and you

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.270 
is that you have a time limit and you
have<00:02:42.299> no<00:02:42.450> lives<00:02:42.659> so<00:02:42.930> your<00:02:43.109> feel<00:02:43.409> you<00:02:43.889> know<00:02:44.040> all

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
have no lives so your feel you know all

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.009 
have no lives so your feel you know all
the<00:02:44.430> pressure<00:02:44.669> is<00:02:44.849> gone<00:02:45.030> i<00:02:45.060> should<00:02:45.299> say<00:02:45.510> as<00:02:45.989> far

00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:46.019 
the pressure is gone i should say as far

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:49.729 
the pressure is gone i should say as far
as<00:02:46.379> whacking<00:02:46.799> these<00:02:46.919> vegetables<00:02:47.459> goes<00:02:48.739> but

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:49.739 
as whacking these vegetables goes but

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:51.379 
as whacking these vegetables goes but
you<00:02:49.919> do<00:02:50.069> have<00:02:50.219> to<00:02:50.370> hit<00:02:50.519> as<00:02:50.639> many<00:02:50.790> as<00:02:51.060> possible

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:51.389 
you do have to hit as many as possible

00:02:51.389 --> 00:02:53.179 
you do have to hit as many as possible
hitting<00:02:51.840> bombs<00:02:52.019> knocks<00:02:52.349> off<00:02:52.560> a<00:02:52.590> few<00:02:52.859> points

00:02:53.179 --> 00:02:53.189 
hitting bombs knocks off a few points

00:02:53.189 --> 00:02:55.490 
hitting bombs knocks off a few points
off<00:02:53.310> of<00:02:53.489> your<00:02:53.639> time<00:02:53.969> limit<00:02:54.329> so<00:02:55.109> that's

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
off of your time limit so that's

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.619 
off of your time limit so that's
basically<00:02:55.859> the<00:02:56.159> same<00:02:56.370> ideas<00:02:56.760> fruit<00:02:57.030> ninja<00:02:57.419> and

00:02:57.619 --> 00:02:57.629 
basically the same ideas fruit ninja and

00:02:57.629 --> 00:02:59.179

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:33.530 
more of this that would be quite nice
and<00:03:32.459> it'd<00:03:32.579> be<00:03:32.669> definitely<00:03:33.060> something<00:03:33.329> to<00:03:33.419> add

should say instead something to add that
would<00:03:38.669> be<00:03:38.759> different<00:03:39.120> from<00:03:39.239> fruit<00:03:39.540> ninja<00:03:39.810> you

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
would be different from fruit ninja you

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:41.149 
would be different from fruit ninja you
have<00:03:40.079> a<00:03:40.139> lot<00:03:40.319> of<00:03:40.349> potential<00:03:40.680> there<00:03:40.829> so<00:03:41.099> we

00:03:41.149 --> 00:03:41.159 
have a lot of potential there so we

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:42.469 
have a lot of potential there so we
really<00:03:41.370> hope<00:03:41.519> that<00:03:41.699> the<00:03:41.849> developers

00:03:42.469 --> 00:03:42.479 
really hope that the developers

00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:43.960 
really hope that the developers
capitalize<00:03:42.959> on<00:03:42.989> that<00:03:43.169> in<00:03:43.379> future<00:03:43.560> updates

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:43.970 
capitalize on that in future updates

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:46.129 
capitalize on that in future updates
otherwise<00:03:44.970> you<00:03:45.150> know<00:03:45.239> the<00:03:45.389> app<00:03:45.509> is<00:03:45.720> great<00:03:45.959> for

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:46.139 
otherwise you know the app is great for

00:03:46.139 --> 00:03:47.629 
otherwise you know the app is great for
what<00:03:46.229> it<00:03:46.319> is<00:03:46.439> it's<00:03:46.650> the<00:03:46.769> same<00:03:46.949> exact<00:03:47.250> gameplay

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:47.639 
what it is it's the same exact gameplay

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:49.249 
what it is it's the same exact gameplay
it's<00:03:47.759> replicated<00:03:48.329> well<00:03:48.509> and<00:03:48.720> in<00:03:48.810> fact<00:03:49.049> it's

00:03:49.249 --> 00:03:49.259 
it's replicated well and in fact it's

00:03:49.259 --> 00:03:53.089 
it's replicated well and in fact it's
probably<00:03:49.349> the<00:03:49.620> best<00:03:50.299> fruit<00:03:51.299> ninja<00:03:51.689> cloned<00:03:52.650> we

00:03:53.089 --> 00:03:53.099 
probably the best fruit ninja cloned we

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:54.890 
probably the best fruit ninja cloned we
should<00:03:53.280> say<00:03:53.519> that<00:03:54.120> we've<00:03:54.239> seen<00:03:54.449> in<00:03:54.599> a<00:03:54.659> long

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:54.900 
should say that we've seen in a long

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:56.689 
should say that we've seen in a long
time<00:03:54.930> then<00:03:55.439> again<00:03:55.709> it<00:03:55.829> is<00:03:56.009> a<00:03:56.040> fruit<00:03:56.340> ninja
