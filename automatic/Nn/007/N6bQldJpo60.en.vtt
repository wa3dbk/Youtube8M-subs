00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
on to the race I'm in second and this

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.799 
on to the race I'm in second and this
guy's<00:00:54.300> this<00:00:54.780> massive<00:00:55.199> lag<00:00:55.440> are<00:00:55.680> in<00:00:55.980> first<00:00:56.399> and

00:04:42.659 --> 00:04:42.669 
i'm trying to make epic moments 3 as

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:44.520 
i'm trying to make epic moments 3 as
epic<00:04:43.210> as<00:04:43.300> i<00:04:43.419> possibly<00:04:43.780> can<00:04:43.900> so<00:04:44.289> it<00:04:44.320> might<00:04:44.500> take

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:44.530 
epic as i possibly can so it might take

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:48.510 
epic as i possibly can so it might take
a<00:04:44.740> long<00:04:45.190> time<00:04:45.430> still<00:04:45.760> like<00:04:46.510> maybe<00:04:46.780> on<00:04:47.340> if<00:04:48.340> i

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:48.520 
a long time still like maybe on if i

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:50.400 
a long time still like maybe on if i
keep<00:04:48.729> recording<00:04:49.120> worldwide's<00:04:49.600> like<00:04:50.080> a<00:04:50.229> lot

keep recording worldwide's like a lot
might<00:04:50.650> take<00:04:50.860> maybe<00:04:51.070> few<00:04:51.940> weeks<00:04:52.180> but<00:04:52.479> if<00:04:52.840> I<00:04:53.050> did

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:53.200 
might take maybe few weeks but if I did

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:55.050 
might take maybe few weeks but if I did
just<00:04:53.650> look<00:04:54.010> what<00:04:54.039> pro<00:04:54.370> world<00:04:54.580> was<00:04:54.700> probably

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:55.060 
just look what pro world was probably

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:58.830 
just look what pro world was probably
like<00:04:55.389> I<00:04:55.770> don't<00:04:56.770> know<00:04:56.860> I<00:04:57.389> might<00:04:58.389> take<00:04:58.600> like<00:04:58.780> a

00:04:58.830 --> 00:04:58.840 
like I don't know I might take like a

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:02.460 
like I don't know I might take like a
fear<00:05:00.419> maybe<00:05:01.419> one<00:05:01.630> month<00:05:01.870> something<00:05:02.289> I'm<00:05:02.410> not
