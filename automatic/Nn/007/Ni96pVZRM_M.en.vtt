and honestly depending on your form and
depending<00:01:31.149> on<00:01:31.470> the<00:01:32.470> way<00:01:32.619> you're<00:01:32.770> using<00:01:32.950> your

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:33.159 
depending on the way you're using your

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:35.249 
depending on the way you're using your
chord<00:01:33.399> you<00:01:33.820> could<00:01:33.970> use<00:01:34.270> any<00:01:34.539> note<00:01:34.810> in<00:01:35.020> the

00:01:35.249 --> 00:01:35.259 
chord you could use any note in the

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:36.930 
chord you could use any note in the
chord<00:01:35.409> as<00:01:35.590> an<00:01:35.680> alternate<00:01:36.100> note<00:01:36.280> so<00:01:36.759> for

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:36.940 
chord as an alternate note so for

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:39.029 
chord as an alternate note so for
example<00:01:37.330> I<00:01:37.450> could<00:01:37.509> alternate<00:01:38.020> between<00:01:38.140> the

00:01:39.029 --> 00:01:39.039 
example I could alternate between the

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:41.399 
example I could alternate between the
hitting<00:01:39.460> the<00:01:39.580> fifth<00:01:39.850> string<00:01:40.119> and<00:01:40.409> then

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:41.409 
hitting the fifth string and then

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:47.670 
hitting the fifth string and then
hitting<00:01:41.619> the<00:01:41.710> fourth<00:01:41.920> string

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:47.680 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:49.320 

or<00:01:48.190> I<00:01:48.220> could<00:01:48.340> alternate<00:01:48.700> between<00:01:48.820> hitting<00:01:49.240> the

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:49.330 
or I could alternate between hitting the

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:50.370 
or I could alternate between hitting the
fifth<00:01:49.510> string<00:01:49.720> and<00:01:49.780> hitting<00:01:50.080> the<00:01:50.200> third

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:50.380 
fifth string and hitting the third

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:56.320 
fifth string and hitting the third
string

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:56.330 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:57.940 

it<00:01:56.930> definitely<00:01:57.170> gives<00:01:57.650> the<00:01:57.770> chord

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:57.950 
it definitely gives the chord

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:59.320 
it definitely gives the chord
progression<00:01:58.400> more<00:01:58.550> motion<00:01:58.910> than<00:01:59.030> if<00:01:59.150> you<00:01:59.240> were

00:01:59.320 --> 00:01:59.330 
progression more motion than if you were

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:02.250 
progression more motion than if you were
just<00:01:59.480> strumming

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:02.260 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.350 

but<00:02:03.010> for<00:02:03.160> right<00:02:03.250> now<00:02:03.310> for<00:02:03.640> that<00:02:03.730> country<00:02:04.120> sound

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:04.360 
but for right now for that country sound

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:05.640 
but for right now for that country sound
that<00:02:04.540> we're<00:02:04.660> going<00:02:04.780> to<00:02:04.840> be<00:02:04.930> going<00:02:05.080> for<00:02:05.410> we're

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:05.650 
that we're going to be going for we're

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:10.150 
that we're going to be going for we're
using<00:02:05.920> the<00:02:06.130> fifth

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:20.150 

you

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.450 

so<00:02:20.910> the<00:02:21.000> intro<00:02:21.300> starts<00:02:21.630> with<00:02:21.750> a<00:02:21.780> baseline<00:02:22.460> pick

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:23.460 
so the intro starts with a baseline pick

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:28.010 
so the intro starts with a baseline pick
up<00:02:23.640> starting<00:02:24.090> on<00:02:24.150> beat<00:02:24.330> 2<00:02:24.540> 1<00:02:24.930> 2<00:02:25.290> 4<00:02:26.780> into<00:02:27.780> an<00:02:27.870> a

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
up starting on beat 2 1 2 4 into an a

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:29.720 
up starting on beat 2 1 2 4 into an a
chord<00:02:28.410> you're<00:02:28.950> gonna<00:02:29.040> hear<00:02:29.250> this<00:02:29.400> type<00:02:29.700> of

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
chord you're gonna hear this type of

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.430 
chord you're gonna hear this type of
strumming<00:02:30.360> pattern<00:02:30.720> that<00:02:30.870> he<00:02:31.110> uses

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
strumming pattern that he uses

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:32.990 
strumming pattern that he uses
throughout<00:02:31.680> the<00:02:31.860> song<00:02:32.070> where<00:02:32.730> he<00:02:32.820> plays<00:02:32.970> a
