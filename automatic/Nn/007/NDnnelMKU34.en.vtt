00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
work and reason why there's no hole just

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.280 
work and reason why there's no hole just
because<00:00:35.040> I<00:00:35.070> cross<00:00:35.550> the<00:00:35.790> yarn<00:00:36.059> now<00:00:36.809> let<00:00:36.989> me<00:00:37.110> show

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
because I cross the yarn now let me show

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.209 
because I cross the yarn now let me show
you<00:00:37.350> how<00:00:37.590> to<00:00:37.620> do<00:00:37.890> that<00:00:39.590> if<00:00:40.590> you<00:00:40.770> notice<00:00:41.070> I<00:00:41.190> have

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
you how to do that if you notice I have

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.799 
you how to do that if you notice I have
bobbins<00:00:41.910> that<00:00:42.239> hold<00:00:43.170> the<00:00:43.649> yarns<00:00:44.430> that<00:00:44.809> in

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
bobbins that hold the yarns that in

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.690 
bobbins that hold the yarns that in
different<00:00:45.989> places<00:00:46.530> so<00:00:47.010> I<00:00:47.129> can<00:00:47.340> follow<00:00:47.520> my

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
different places so I can follow my

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.709 
different places so I can follow my
graph<00:00:48.149> because<00:00:48.780> it<00:00:48.899> makes<00:00:49.110> it<00:00:49.289> easier<00:00:49.739> to<00:00:50.719> do

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
graph because it makes it easier to do

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.069 
graph because it makes it easier to do
color<00:00:52.079> changes<00:00:53.120> okay<00:00:54.120> so<00:00:54.180> what<00:00:54.570> I'm<00:00:54.690> doing<00:00:54.989> on

picked up the black stitch but that

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:36.880 
picked up the black stitch but that
would<00:01:33.890> leave<00:01:34.130> a<00:01:34.160> hole<00:01:35.080> so<00:01:36.080> you<00:01:36.140> don't<00:01:36.470> want<00:01:36.770> a

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.590 
that's what you would do on a color

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:32.190 
that's what you would do on a color
change<00:03:29.950> and<00:03:30.850> you<00:03:31.150> would<00:03:31.300> do<00:03:31.450> that<00:03:31.630> every<00:03:31.840> time

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:32.200

your color changes you would twist or

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:39.210 
your color changes you would twist or
you<00:03:37.630> would<00:03:37.810> make<00:03:37.990> sure<00:03:38.260> that<00:03:38.470> you<00:03:38.650> picked<00:03:39.010> up

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220
