00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:18.010
 a grueling job has giuliana 

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:19.900
 the complete responsibility over everything 

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:22.420
 what about the handling of the aircraft 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:25.600
 she usually has to do it 

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:27.490
 one hour time before heading to the position 

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:29.740
 is going to get the edge of the agent 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:32.020
 management assigned their plane 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:34.840
 then giuliana gets on the way 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:38.350
 this job here drives me crazy 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:42.730
 fun that is a lot of responsibility but it 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:44.920
 is also very curious and juliana lies 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:45.780
 The amf league is barely going on 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.789

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:51.609

 the container be pulled away here 

00:00:51.609 --> 00:00:54.999
 parked containers interfere with 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:57.370
 Loading the machine 

00:00:54.999 --> 00:00:59.530
 this could lead to delays 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:02.079
 with the loading crew and the master 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:03.940
 will be discussed first what to do 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:07.710
 is a lot of work 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:07.710
 there is no time to rest 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:14.730
 it continues in the plane must here 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.750
 giuliana see if everything is prepared 

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:17.940
 and clean 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.160
 In the meantime, this will be catering 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:22.920
 Also supplied the number of food 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:25.940
 board controls the ramp agent i 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.940
 must have the look 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:33.960
 the condor machine is ready 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:36.180
 I have to go on now to mean all 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.930
 to get information about bacteria whether 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.930
 you fit 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:48.450
 love to wear high and how many 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:50.640
 Clever ones are compatible with the parents 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.520
 what you have on board 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.409
 Today is a homage on board 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.630
 passenger helping with boarding 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:00.000
 also needs the stroller 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.460
 remains of three babies have invited 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.040
 also going diana for the boarding time 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:07.619
 note so now I have to come back 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.660
 crime schedule looks like one 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:11.130
 half an hour before departure with the order 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:14.310
 to start the passenger 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:15.209
 seven more minutes everything works so far 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.880
 according to plan 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:20.220
 So it's back to the apron slowly 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.510
 It will be hectic to allow some buyers 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.459
 not yet be loaded 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:27.540
 the transfer passengers do not have yet 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:29.910
 Checked in without my permission 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.530
 the colleagues here nothing loaded because 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:34.170
 then maybe again 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.340
 do not come back to charge it 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.620
 conceive 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:40.200
 but now everything works and juliana 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:42.060
 signs the loading protocol that 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.290
 boarding meanwhile everything runs 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.570
 seems to work 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:48.140
 But why is the staircase at the back? 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:51.680
 not ending yet juliana asks 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:54.420
 I am missing books for the cross-country skiing 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.310
 bravo 44 you have someone already 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.019
 sent out 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:00.870
 The caterer quickly asks 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:01.440
 done now you have to go back to the 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.540
 waters 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:05.100
 the boarding is completely all 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:07.410
 Passengers are on board 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:09.060
 before the plane door closes the 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:10.140
 ramp agent in still with the pilot 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.140
 to consult 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:14.420
 everything is ready here 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:16.790
 juliana gets as confirmation a 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:21.100

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:21.100
 All loading ramps are closed at the bottom 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:38.989
 We have to over the door later 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:41.330
 then suddenly close a light 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:44.840
 released baggage out of now 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:46.820

 Bauer everything clear we are completely finished 

00:03:56.989 --> 00:04:02.000
 but Giuliana has everything screaming internet 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:02.989
 then done the lot of money 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.190
 moving 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:10.230
 we did well 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:12.880

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:14.530

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:16.900
 the job is the ramp agent in 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:19.480

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:23.580
