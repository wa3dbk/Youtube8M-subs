they need a novela government in design
because<00:00:04.560> wash<00:00:04.830> their<00:00:06.470> dirty<00:00:07.470> hands<00:00:08.010> name<00:00:10.460> but

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
because wash their dirty hands name but

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.340 
because wash their dirty hands name but
this<00:00:11.639> is<00:00:12.440> meant<00:00:13.440> either<00:00:14.990> amerikanische<00:00:15.990> flow

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
this is meant either amerikanische flow

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:26.750 
this is meant either amerikanische flow
this<00:00:16.830> happen

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.190 

I<00:00:29.000> remember<00:00:30.000> the<00:00:30.120> first<00:00:30.330> time<00:00:30.540> I<00:00:30.600> saw<00:00:30.840> an<00:00:30.960> apple

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:31.200 
I remember the first time I saw an apple

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.280 
I remember the first time I saw an apple
product<00:00:31.590> I<00:00:32.180> remember<00:00:33.180> it<00:00:33.300> so<00:00:33.330> clearly<00:00:33.690> because

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
product I remember it so clearly because

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.920 
product I remember it so clearly because
it<00:00:34.470> was<00:00:34.650> the<00:00:34.770> first<00:00:35.070> time<00:00:35.280> I<00:00:35.310> realized<00:00:35.900> when<00:00:36.900> I

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
it was the first time I realized when I

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.990 
it was the first time I realized when I
saw<00:00:37.290> this<00:00:37.830> product<00:00:38.220> I<00:00:40.070> got<00:00:41.070> a<00:00:41.130> very<00:00:41.640> clear

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
saw this product I got a very clear

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.700 
saw this product I got a very clear
sense<00:00:42.270> of<00:00:42.450> the<00:00:42.510> people<00:00:42.900> that<00:00:43.080> designed<00:00:43.440> it<00:00:43.590> and

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
sense of the people that designed it and

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:50.479 
sense of the people that designed it and
made<00:00:43.770> it<00:00:43.920> a<00:00:48.140> big<00:00:49.140> definition<00:00:49.860> of<00:00:49.980> who<00:00:50.160> you<00:00:50.340> are

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
made it a big definition of who you are

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.270 
made it a big definition of who you are
as<00:00:50.640> a<00:00:50.670> designer<00:00:51.090> it's<00:00:51.900> it's<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:52.800> way<00:00:52.830> that<00:00:53.160> you

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
as a designer it's it's the way that you

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.860 
as a designer it's it's the way that you
look<00:00:53.460> at<00:00:53.580> the<00:00:53.699> world<00:00:53.940> and<00:00:54.980> I<00:00:56.540> guess<00:00:57.540> it's<00:00:57.750> one

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
look at the world and I guess it's one

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.899 
look at the world and I guess it's one
of<00:00:57.989> the<00:00:58.080> sort<00:00:58.290> of<00:00:58.320> curses<00:00:59.040> of<00:00:59.190> what<00:00:59.370> you<00:00:59.519> do<00:00:59.729> is

00:00:59.899 --> 00:00:59.909 
of the sort of curses of what you do is

00:00:59.909 --> 00:01:02.210 
of the sort of curses of what you do is
that<00:01:00.059> you're<00:01:00.210> constantly<00:01:01.070> looking<00:01:02.070> at

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:02.220 
that you're constantly looking at

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:05.299 
that you're constantly looking at
something<00:01:02.430> and<00:01:02.670> thinking<00:01:02.760> why<00:01:03.210> why<00:01:03.949> why<00:01:04.949> is<00:01:05.010> it

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
something and thinking why why why is it

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:05.870 
something and thinking why why why is it
like<00:01:05.460> that

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
like that

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.210 
like that
what<00:01:06.300> why<00:01:07.229> is<00:01:07.260> it<00:01:07.440> like<00:01:07.590> that<00:01:07.620> and<00:01:07.890> not<00:01:08.040> like

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
what why is it like that and not like

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.280 
what why is it like that and not like
this<00:01:08.659> and<00:01:10.159> so<00:01:11.159> in<00:01:11.250> that<00:01:11.370> sense<00:01:11.430> you're

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:12.290 
this and so in that sense you're

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:20.469 
this and so in that sense you're
constantly<00:01:13.400> designing

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:20.479 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:23.440 

when<00:01:21.259> we're<00:01:21.409> designing<00:01:21.649> a<00:01:21.950> product<00:01:22.250> we<00:01:23.149> have

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:23.450 
when we're designing a product we have

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.260 
when we're designing a product we have
to<00:01:23.750> look<00:01:24.289> to<00:01:24.520> different<00:01:25.520> attributes<00:01:26.030> of<00:01:26.149> the

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.270 
to look to different attributes of the

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:27.429 
to look to different attributes of the
product<00:01:26.509> and<00:01:26.780> some<00:01:27.049> of<00:01:27.170> those<00:01:27.229> attributes

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:27.439 
product and some of those attributes

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:30.010 
product and some of those attributes
will<00:01:27.920> be<00:01:28.299> materials<00:01:29.299> that<00:01:29.450> it's<00:01:29.570> made<00:01:29.750> from

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020 
will be materials that it's made from

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.350 
will be materials that it's made from
and<00:01:30.289> the<00:01:30.860> form<00:01:31.219> that's<00:01:31.610> connected<00:01:32.149> to<00:01:32.179> those

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:32.360 
and the form that's connected to those

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.380 
and the form that's connected to those
materials<00:01:33.369> so<00:01:34.369> for<00:01:34.520> example<00:01:34.909> with<00:01:35.000> the<00:01:35.090> first

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:35.390 
materials so for example with the first

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:38.440 
materials so for example with the first
iMac<00:01:36.380> that<00:01:36.649> we<00:01:36.770> made<00:01:36.979> the<00:01:37.490> primary<00:01:37.909> component

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450 
iMac that we made the primary component

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:40.270 
iMac that we made the primary component
of<00:01:38.569> that<00:01:38.720> was<00:01:38.990> the<00:01:39.200> cathode<00:01:39.590> ray<00:01:39.740> tube<00:01:40.009> which

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:40.280 
of that was the cathode ray tube which

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.669 
of that was the cathode ray tube which
was<00:01:40.429> spherical<00:01:40.750> we<00:01:41.750> would<00:01:41.929> have<00:01:42.140> an<00:01:42.259> entirely

00:01:42.669 --> 00:01:42.679 
was spherical we would have an entirely

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:44.529 
was spherical we would have an entirely
different<00:01:43.189> approach<00:01:43.700> to<00:01:44.179> designing

00:01:44.529 --> 00:01:44.539 
different approach to designing

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:46.330 
different approach to designing
something<00:01:44.899> like<00:01:45.110> that<00:01:45.500> then<00:01:45.920> the<00:01:46.039> current

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 
something like that then the current

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.580 
something like that then the current
iMac<00:01:46.670> which<00:01:46.909> is<00:01:47.090> a<00:01:47.119> very<00:01:47.390> thin<00:01:47.450> flat<00:01:48.289> panel

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.590 
iMac which is a very thin flat panel

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:51.279 
iMac which is a very thin flat panel
display<00:01:48.979> other<00:01:49.880> issues<00:01:50.390> would<00:01:50.569> be<00:01:50.600> you<00:01:51.170> know

00:01:51.279 --> 00:01:51.289 
display other issues would be you know

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:53.620 
display other issues would be you know
just<00:01:51.530> physically<00:01:51.979> how<00:01:52.310> do<00:01:52.369> you<00:01:52.580> connect<00:01:53.240> to

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:53.630 
just physically how do you connect to

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:55.029 
just physically how do you connect to
the<00:01:53.750> product<00:01:54.110> so<00:01:54.319> for<00:01:54.470> example<00:01:54.860> something

00:01:55.029 --> 00:01:55.039 
the product so for example something

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:58.419 
the product so for example something
like<00:01:55.189> the<00:01:55.340> iPhone<00:01:56.200> everything<00:01:57.200> defers<00:01:57.649> to<00:01:58.099> the

00:01:58.419 --> 00:01:58.429 
like the iPhone everything defers to the

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:02.800 
like the iPhone everything defers to the
display<00:01:58.880> a<00:02:01.000> lot<00:02:02.000> of<00:02:02.149> what<00:02:02.299> we<00:02:02.420> seem<00:02:02.630> to<00:02:02.659> be

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810 
display a lot of what we seem to be

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.050 
display a lot of what we seem to be
doing<00:02:03.530> in<00:02:03.799> a<00:02:04.159> product<00:02:04.520> like<00:02:04.640> that<00:02:04.849> he's

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 
doing in a product like that he's

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:06.729 
doing in a product like that he's
actually<00:02:05.209> getting<00:02:05.479> design<00:02:05.959> out<00:02:06.140> of<00:02:06.229> the<00:02:06.289> way

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:06.739 
actually getting design out of the way

00:02:06.739 --> 00:02:11.229 
actually getting design out of the way
and<00:02:07.450> I<00:02:08.450> think<00:02:08.509> when<00:02:08.929> forms<00:02:09.679> develop<00:02:10.399> with<00:02:11.030> that

00:02:11.229 --> 00:02:11.239 
and I think when forms develop with that

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:12.550 
and I think when forms develop with that
sort<00:02:11.480> of<00:02:11.540> reason<00:02:12.019> and<00:02:12.230> they're<00:02:12.410> not<00:02:12.500> just

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
sort of reason and they're not just

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.069 
sort of reason and they're not just
arbitrary<00:02:13.190> shapes<00:02:13.510> it<00:02:14.510> feels<00:02:14.870> almost

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:15.079 
arbitrary shapes it feels almost

00:02:15.079 --> 00:02:18.400 
arbitrary shapes it feels almost
inevitable<00:02:15.890> it<00:02:16.099> feels<00:02:16.610> almost<00:02:17.049> undesigned<00:02:18.049> it

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 
inevitable it feels almost undesigned it

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:20.559 
inevitable it feels almost undesigned it
feels<00:02:19.010> almost<00:02:19.190> like<00:02:19.430> world<00:02:19.819> course<00:02:20.269> it's<00:02:20.480> that

00:02:20.559 --> 00:02:20.569 
feels almost like world course it's that

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:23.170 
feels almost like world course it's that
way<00:02:20.840> I<00:02:20.870> mean<00:02:21.340> you<00:02:22.340> know<00:02:22.459> why<00:02:22.670> wouldn't<00:02:22.970> it<00:02:23.000> be

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
way I mean you know why wouldn't it be

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:29.700 
way I mean you know why wouldn't it be
any<00:02:23.480> other<00:02:23.989> way

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:29.710 

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:33.370 

this<00:02:30.710> is<00:02:30.890> the<00:02:31.040> bezel<00:02:31.460> for<00:02:32.000> the<00:02:32.120> iMac<00:02:32.510> when<00:02:33.260> we

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:33.380 
this is the bezel for the iMac when we

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:35.200 
this is the bezel for the iMac when we
remove<00:02:33.680> this<00:02:33.950> the<00:02:34.010> aluminium<00:02:34.880> for<00:02:35.120> the

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:35.210 
remove this the aluminium for the

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:37.720 
remove this the aluminium for the
display<00:02:35.630> in<00:02:35.780> the<00:02:35.900> center<00:02:36.080> here<00:02:36.610> we<00:02:37.610> actually

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
display in the center here we actually

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:40.300 
display in the center here we actually
take<00:02:38.120> that<00:02:38.330> material<00:02:38.480> and<00:02:39.080> then<00:02:39.620> we<00:02:39.800> can<00:02:40.070> make

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
take that material and then we can make

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:46.150 
take that material and then we can make
-<00:02:40.790> to<00:02:42.070> keyboard<00:02:43.070> frames<00:02:43.370> from<00:02:43.700> it<00:02:44.980> these<00:02:45.980> are

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:46.160 
- to keyboard frames from it these are

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.040 
- to keyboard frames from it these are
literally<00:02:46.580> just<00:02:46.760> a<00:02:46.880> couple<00:02:46.910> of<00:02:47.450> the<00:02:47.540> stages<00:02:48.020> of

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:48.050 
literally just a couple of the stages of

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:50.860 
literally just a couple of the stages of
how<00:02:48.320> you<00:02:48.380> make<00:02:48.650> the<00:02:48.890> MacBook<00:02:49.220> Air<00:02:49.870> rough

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
how you make the MacBook Air rough

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:53.860 
how you make the MacBook Air rough
cutting<00:02:51.430> this<00:02:52.430> is<00:02:52.580> for<00:02:53.180> the<00:02:53.240> keyboard<00:02:53.660> world

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
cutting this is for the keyboard world

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.580 
cutting this is for the keyboard world
and<00:02:54.710> there<00:02:54.950> is<00:02:54.980> a<00:02:55.270> remarkable<00:02:56.270> efficiency<00:02:56.960> and

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.590 
and there is a remarkable efficiency and

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:00.100 
and there is a remarkable efficiency and
beauty<00:02:58.010> to<00:02:58.430> just<00:02:58.730> how<00:02:59.120> much<00:02:59.180> a<00:02:59.360> single<00:02:59.840> part

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.110 
beauty to just how much a single part

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:01.690 
beauty to just how much a single part
can<00:03:00.380> do<00:03:00.530> it<00:03:00.680> and<00:03:00.800> I<00:03:00.830> think<00:03:01.010> that's<00:03:01.160> one<00:03:01.490> of<00:03:01.520> the

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.700 
can do it and I think that's one of the

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:03.490 
can do it and I think that's one of the
things<00:03:01.940> that<00:03:02.150> we<00:03:02.270> you<00:03:02.570> know<00:03:02.660> we<00:03:02.810> push<00:03:03.140> and<00:03:03.320> push

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.500 
things that we you know we push and push

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.650 
things that we you know we push and push
ourselves<00:03:03.680> on<00:03:04.160> it's<00:03:04.790> trying<00:03:05.120> to<00:03:05.240> figure<00:03:05.540> out

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:05.660 
ourselves on it's trying to figure out

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:08.170 
ourselves on it's trying to figure out
what<00:03:05.810> can<00:03:06.050> we<00:03:06.200> do<00:03:06.470> the<00:03:07.040> job<00:03:07.310> of<00:03:07.490> those<00:03:07.640> six

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
what can we do the job of those six

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.800 
what can we do the job of those six
parts<00:03:08.660> with<00:03:09.110> just<00:03:09.410> one<00:03:10.210> this<00:03:11.210> part<00:03:11.600> is

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.810 
parts with just one this part is

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:15.190 
parts with just one this part is
actually<00:03:11.960> starts<00:03:12.590> off<00:03:12.770> as<00:03:13.610> as<00:03:14.480> this<00:03:14.750> extrusion

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.200 
actually starts off as as this extrusion

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.040 
actually starts off as as this extrusion
and<00:03:15.790> so<00:03:16.790> this<00:03:16.940> is<00:03:17.090> a<00:03:17.120> this<00:03:17.630> is<00:03:17.690> an<00:03:17.900> aluminium

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:18.050 
and so this is a this is an aluminium

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:22.650 
and so this is a this is an aluminium
extrusion<00:03:19.010> that<00:03:19.820> goes<00:03:20.090> through<00:03:20.950> multiple

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:22.660 
extrusion that goes through multiple

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:25.930 
extrusion that goes through multiple
operations<00:03:23.660> most<00:03:24.260> of<00:03:24.500> them<00:03:24.710> CNC<00:03:25.550> machined

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:25.940 
operations most of them CNC machined

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:32.260 
operations most of them CNC machined
operations<00:03:26.570> to<00:03:27.350> end<00:03:27.530> up<00:03:30.700> to<00:03:31.700> end<00:03:31.850> up<00:03:31.970> with<00:03:32.120> this

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:32.270 
operations to end up to end up with this

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:34.900 
operations to end up to end up with this
part<00:03:32.600> and<00:03:33.410> so<00:03:33.709> you<00:03:33.920> can<00:03:34.070> see<00:03:34.250> I<00:03:34.280> mean<00:03:34.580> just<00:03:34.760> a

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:34.910 
part and so you can see I mean just a

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:37.870 
part and so you can see I mean just a
dramatic<00:03:35.770> -<00:03:36.770> the<00:03:36.890> transformation<00:03:37.340> between

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:37.880 
dramatic - the transformation between

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:41.500 
dramatic - the transformation between
this<00:03:38.390> raw<00:03:38.600> blank<00:03:38.959> and<00:03:39.380> the<00:03:39.709> final<00:03:40.100> part<00:03:40.510> but

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:41.510 
this raw blank and the final part but

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:44.590 
this raw blank and the final part but
what<00:03:41.660> we<00:03:41.780> end<00:03:41.930> up<00:03:42.140> with<00:03:42.500> is<00:03:43.220> a<00:03:43.280> part<00:03:43.880> that's<00:03:44.209> got

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:44.600 
what we end up with is a part that's got

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:48.430 
what we end up with is a part that's got
all<00:03:45.700> of<00:03:46.700> the<00:03:46.880> mounting<00:03:47.600> features<00:03:47.840> so<00:03:48.170> all<00:03:48.320> of

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:48.440 
all of the mounting features so all of

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:50.350 
all of the mounting features so all of
the<00:03:48.530> bosses<00:03:48.740> they're<00:03:49.400> all<00:03:49.550> is<00:03:49.760> this<00:03:50.030> this<00:03:50.180> is

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:50.360 
the bosses they're all is this this is

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:53.070 
the bosses they're all is this this is
just<00:03:50.540> one<00:03:50.720> part<00:03:51.050> but<00:03:51.560> this<00:03:51.740> one<00:03:51.980> part<00:03:52.370> is<00:03:52.730> is

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:53.080 
just one part but this one part is is

just one part but this one part is is
providing<00:03:54.080> so<00:03:54.590> much<00:03:54.770> functionality<00:03:55.840> and<00:03:56.840> this

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:57.620 
providing so much functionality and this

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:00.100 
providing so much functionality and this
one<00:03:57.800> part<00:03:58.070> really<00:03:58.430> does<00:03:58.670> does<00:03:59.630> enable<00:03:59.870> this

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:05.390 
the effort behind a product like the

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:08.949 
the effort behind a product like the
MacBook<00:04:05.570> Air<00:04:06.010> was<00:04:07.810> experimenting<00:04:08.810> with

00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:08.959 
MacBook Air was experimenting with

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:10.750 
MacBook Air was experimenting with
different<00:04:09.080> processes<00:04:09.770> it<00:04:09.950> you<00:04:10.430> know<00:04:10.550> that

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:10.760 
different processes it you know that

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:14.110 
different processes it you know that
there's<00:04:11.180> a<00:04:11.380> completely<00:04:12.380> non-obvious<00:04:12.560> but<00:04:13.220> the

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:14.120 
there's a completely non-obvious but the

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:15.940 
there's a completely non-obvious but the
way<00:04:14.270> that<00:04:14.450> you<00:04:14.570> hold<00:04:14.840> you<00:04:15.140> know<00:04:15.260> to<00:04:15.320> get<00:04:15.620> from

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:15.950 
way that you hold you know to get from

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:19.900 
way that you hold you know to get from
this<00:04:16.910> part<00:04:17.299> to<00:04:17.720> this<00:04:17.870> part<00:04:18.520> that<00:04:19.520> there<00:04:19.700> are<00:04:19.790> an

this part to this part that there are an

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:22.990 
this part to this part that there are an
incredibly<00:04:20.570> complex<00:04:21.200> series<00:04:21.620> of<00:04:21.799> fixtures<00:04:22.400> to

incredibly complex series of fixtures to

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.020 
incredibly complex series of fixtures to
hold<00:04:23.240> this<00:04:23.720> part<00:04:24.050> in<00:04:24.580> in<00:04:25.580> the<00:04:25.700> different

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:26.030 
hold this part in in the different

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:29.560 
hold this part in in the different
machine<00:04:26.660> stages<00:04:27.580> and<00:04:28.580> we<00:04:28.790> end<00:04:28.910> up<00:04:29.030> spending<00:04:29.300> a

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:29.570 
machine stages and we end up spending a

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:32.340 
machine stages and we end up spending a
lot<00:04:29.780> of<00:04:29.810> time<00:04:29.900> designing<00:04:30.260> fixtures

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:32.350 
lot of time designing fixtures

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:35.740 
lot of time designing fixtures
the<00:04:33.350> design<00:04:33.800> of<00:04:34.010> this<00:04:34.220> in<00:04:34.550> many<00:04:34.970> ways<00:04:35.210> wasn't

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:35.750 
the design of this in many ways wasn't

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:37.540 
the design of this in many ways wasn't
the<00:04:35.840> design<00:04:36.169> of<00:04:36.380> a<00:04:36.470> physical<00:04:37.010> thing

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:37.550 
the design of a physical thing

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:41.530 
the design of a physical thing
it<00:04:37.610> was<00:04:38.120> figuring<00:04:38.570> in<00:04:38.660> a<00:04:38.690> process<00:04:40.150> it's<00:04:41.150> really

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:41.540 
it was figuring in a process it's really

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:43.090 
it was figuring in a process it's really
important<00:04:41.960> in<00:04:42.020> a<00:04:42.080> product<00:04:42.320> to<00:04:42.560> have<00:04:42.710> a<00:04:42.770> sense

attention an indicator has a value when
it's<00:04:52.790> indicating<00:04:53.510> something<00:04:53.750> but<00:04:54.560> if<00:04:54.650> it's

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:54.800 
it's indicating something but if it's

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:56.920 
it's indicating something but if it's
not<00:04:54.979> indicating<00:04:55.580> something<00:04:56.090> it<00:04:56.330> shouldn't<00:04:56.750> be

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:56.930 
not indicating something it shouldn't be

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:59.710 
not indicating something it shouldn't be
there<00:04:57.460> it's<00:04:58.460> one<00:04:58.669> of<00:04:58.790> those<00:04:58.940> funny<00:04:59.300> things<00:04:59.389> you

00:04:59.710 --> 00:04:59.720 
there it's one of those funny things you

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:03.670 
there it's one of those funny things you
spend<00:05:00.169> so<00:05:00.860> much<00:05:01.040> more<00:05:01.310> time<00:05:01.389> to<00:05:02.389> make<00:05:02.570> it<00:05:02.810> less

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:03.680 
spend so much more time to make it less

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:06.610 
spend so much more time to make it less
conspicuous<00:05:04.190> and<00:05:04.940> less<00:05:05.090> obvious<00:05:05.570> and<00:05:06.410> if<00:05:06.530> you

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:06.620 
conspicuous and less obvious and if you

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:08.140 
conspicuous and less obvious and if you
think<00:05:06.860> about<00:05:06.950> it<00:05:07.250> so<00:05:07.430> many<00:05:07.550> of<00:05:07.639> the<00:05:07.790> products

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:08.150 
think about it so many of the products

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:10.090 
think about it so many of the products
that<00:05:08.300> we're<00:05:08.419> surrounded<00:05:08.660> by<00:05:08.900> they<00:05:09.620> want<00:05:09.919> you

that we're surrounded by they want you

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:13.570 
that we're surrounded by they want you
to<00:05:10.250> be<00:05:10.400> very<00:05:10.669> aware<00:05:10.820> of<00:05:11.479> just<00:05:11.990> how<00:05:12.110> clever<00:05:13.070> the

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:13.580 
to be very aware of just how clever the

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:17.530 
to be very aware of just how clever the
solution<00:05:14.150> was<00:05:15.370> when<00:05:16.370> the<00:05:16.460> indicator<00:05:16.700> comes<00:05:17.150> on

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:17.540 
solution was when the indicator comes on

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:20.469 
solution was when the indicator comes on
I<00:05:17.889> wouldn't<00:05:18.889> expect<00:05:19.100> anybody<00:05:19.490> to<00:05:19.729> point<00:05:20.330> to

00:05:20.469 --> 00:05:20.479 
I wouldn't expect anybody to point to

00:05:20.479 --> 00:05:23.379 
I wouldn't expect anybody to point to
that<00:05:20.600> as<00:05:20.720> a<00:05:20.750> feature<00:05:21.080> but<00:05:21.950> at<00:05:22.130> some<00:05:22.639> level<00:05:23.120> I

00:05:23.379 --> 00:05:23.389 
that as a feature but at some level I

00:05:23.389 --> 00:05:28.060 
that as a feature but at some level I
think<00:05:23.900> you're<00:05:24.110> aware<00:05:24.200> of<00:05:24.500> a<00:05:25.180> calm<00:05:26.180> and<00:05:27.070> and

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:28.070 
think you're aware of a calm and and

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:32.500 
think you're aware of a calm and and
considered<00:05:28.850> solution<00:05:29.510> that<00:05:31.510> therefore

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:32.510 
considered solution that therefore

00:05:34.779 --> 00:05:34.789 
speaks about how you're gonna use it not

the terrible struggles that you know we

the terrible struggles that you know we
