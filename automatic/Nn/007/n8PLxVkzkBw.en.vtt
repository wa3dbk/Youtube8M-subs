and a tool rod pattern both of which you

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.690 
and a tool rod pattern both of which you
get<00:01:31.490> from<00:01:31.670> the<00:01:31.760> stencil<00:01:32.180> table<00:01:32.860> just<00:01:33.860> uh<00:01:33.980> just

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:34.700 
get from the stencil table just uh just

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:35.620 
get from the stencil table just uh just
look<00:01:34.850> through<00:01:34.970> here<00:01:35.210> and<00:01:35.330> you'd<00:01:35.420> eventually

to craft the sword itself or you can use
them<00:02:33.750> to<00:02:34.560> create<00:02:34.590> casts<00:02:35.580> which<00:02:36.540> is<00:02:36.690> what<00:02:36.840> I'm

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930

the cutlass over say the broadsword or a
normal<00:04:54.430> sword<00:04:54.670> is<00:04:55.300> that<00:04:55.360> it<00:04:55.780> has<00:04:55.960> a<00:04:55.990> 10%<00:04:56.880> base

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:57.880
