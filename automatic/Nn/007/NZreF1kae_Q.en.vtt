electrical cable ties tie the two

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.180 
electrical cable ties tie the two
baskets<00:00:48.420> at<00:00:48.570> their<00:00:48.810> tops<00:00:49.079> making<00:00:49.920> a<00:00:49.980> ball

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
baskets at their tops making a ball

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.060 
baskets at their tops making a ball
ensure<00:00:51.060> this<00:00:51.270> is<00:00:51.420> tight<00:00:51.720> and<00:00:51.989> secure<00:00:52.440> and<00:00:52.680> then

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
ensure this is tight and secure and then

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.620 
ensure this is tight and secure and then
book<00:00:53.220> the<00:00:53.370> pantyhose<00:00:53.670> to<00:00:54.120> the<00:00:54.210> top<00:00:54.420> of<00:00:54.570> the

book the pantyhose to the top of the

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:57.170 
book the pantyhose to the top of the
basket<00:00:54.780> so<00:00:55.230> it<00:00:55.620> acts<00:00:55.829> like<00:00:56.070> a<00:00:56.220> stretchy<00:00:56.760> sock

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
basket so it acts like a stretchy sock

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.389 
basket so it acts like a stretchy sock
now<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:58.230> most<00:00:58.410> important<00:00:59.040> part<00:00:59.220> of<00:00:59.309> this

that are starting out it gets the

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.570 
that are starting out it gets the
microbial<00:01:27.210> activity<00:01:27.299> going<00:01:28.049> which<00:01:28.920> is<00:01:28.950> really

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:29.580 
microbial activity going which is really

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:31.219 
microbial activity going which is really
important<00:01:30.000> with<00:01:30.090> coco<00:01:30.420> peat<00:01:30.570> well<00:01:30.930> I<00:01:30.960> put<00:01:31.200> a
