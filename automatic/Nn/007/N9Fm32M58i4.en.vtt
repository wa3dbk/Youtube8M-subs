00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.740
 hanno my knowledge and welcome to 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:05.700
 a new video of me we already 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.760
 probably in the title 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:11.280
 I'll read you today 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.889
 about the best lipsticks from the 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:18.210
 so my absolute talk 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:19.680
 favorites lipstick on yes 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.220
 are the best lipsticks I find 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:25.970
 because they just keep mega long 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.300
 and just fantastic fantastic 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:30.090
 appearance 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.030
 and yes I know it right away 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:36.380
 are the ones from Manhattan and that 

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:38.399
 libdems call themselves lipsticks and 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:39.690
 that's how they look like 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.230
 probably also have knowledge 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:45.090
 other brands also here in the art 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.780
 but after that I find that on 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.160
 best 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.750
 I wanted you in the video now though 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.449
 I also show two more now 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.489
 not so good or he likes me 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.559
 really bad for the price 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:59.399
 So think I already 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:02.850
 tried out of youth a or uk or where 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:05.010
 Always like this brand means permanent 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.810
 l'hebdo this just fine for the price 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.510
 the cost is only around 23 euros 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:12.090
 and the hero is really good 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.130
 but which I really do not recommend 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.619
 can be of l'oreal this here 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.810
 Seats are new I like the color though 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.009
 scary and I really rate 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.479
 like and that was about one too 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:25.799
 favorites this is here with such a 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:27.630
 lip balm but for 11 euro I think 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:29.430
 really really bad because of that 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.400
 just really do not last long now 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.110
 fix for the price yes, I think you 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.340
 just not good because for 11 euros 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.890
 then you ask a bit 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.340
 more and they just do it 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.950
 Not 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.360
 and yes of the durability and everything 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:46.110
 are really the ones from manhattan on 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.520
 best the cost 5 euro 35 and me 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.680
 just wanted to make a offer about it 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.090
 because I really can not do that for a long time 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.649
 I saw it because of Manhattan 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.170
 really really stupid in the stand 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:56.610
 because the lipsticks and so on 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.850
 do not even notice the choice the next 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:02.000
 Below are yes and I have one now 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.439
 just paint the other one of jule now 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.180
 but I will buy myself there several 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:09.209
 have already had what swatch the 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.030
 has not been going for two days now 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:12.040
 from my hand 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:14.770
 and I have no idea as well 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.850
 my hands washed and showered it yes 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:18.370
 just do not go down her anymore 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:21.130
 also needs an oily make up 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:22.270
 Remover around the lipsticks again from 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:24.040
 to get the lips 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:25.209
 the one I own now have the 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.000
 I just now on the lips 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:30.190
 applied almost 20 degrees not so good too 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.360
 my make-up but yes I wanted you 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:32.770
 simply apply 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.050
 you now see just how well I the 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:38.709
 generally apply and you have 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:40.420
 once here this lip color pushes 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:42.959
 you have to take care of your lips 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:46.090
 all of them really awesome 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:47.800
 pigmented and that really did happen 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:49.720
 You really have to carry it on precisely 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.890
 because it really as you said then you 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:51.700
 could it be it looks like maybe 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:54.010
 maybe I'll get out too 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:55.300
 cut me as more of what 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:56.890
 her a bit too much at the side 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:58.660
 have that you can wipe away well yet 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:00.040
 but if it really dried 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:02.190
 really does not get it anymore 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.330
 Forcing would have to be really precise 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:06.940
 and then let that be your 60th 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:09.850
 a second to say so 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:11.530
 and yes that is so dry and said 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:14.410
 then comes this gloss here 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:16.329
 over there and there is just the whole 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:17.320
 shine and so care that the lips even 

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:19.000
 do not dry out 

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:20.799
 I can recommend a thing to you 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.450
 is waiting really long enough though 

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:24.820
 wait two to three minutes 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:26.380
 because I already happened so fast 

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:28.090
 and then it will be all 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:28.510
 that's a bit shaky that's not the case 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:30.549
 beautiful 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:33.459
 So really waiting since these 60 

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:35.860
 seconds otherwise it just happens 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:40.560
 the so crumbles what I just so on the 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:40.560
 market is simply this color intensity 

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:48.250
 I like the color intensity that he likes and 

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:50.709
 that's how the hours last 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:53.530
 they really get the whole evening 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:55.750
 when I'm gone so at least yes the 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:57.940
 actually last twelve hours 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:59.590
 but it is so easy here so 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:01.359
 But you can walk a little bit inside 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:02.079
 quickly back for a while 

00:04:01.359 --> 00:04:03.430
 carry 

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:04.930
 but in the end, the whole remains 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:06.820
 lipstick really all the time 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:08.829
 you have to do it too and to go for it 

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:09.880
 after wear that your love easy 

00:04:08.829 --> 00:04:12.820
 do not dry out 

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:14.769
 because it's already pretty dry, though 

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:16.870
 if you drink it when you drink 

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:19.239
 Smokes if no idea what to do 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:20.090
 the lipstick stays as it is 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:21.620
 so 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:23.600
 I think that's just bombastic 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:25.340
 because you do not have to worry about it anymore 

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:26.750
 lipstick take care you can drink 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:27.260
 and eat and it does not work or everything 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:29.510
 tuned 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:31.370
 Of course, the blog always lives in the glass 

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:33.530
 but the lipstick itself is not 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:35.000
 and there are quite a lot of beautiful ones 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:36.650
 colors choral tones 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.630
 then there is a lighter red what 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:41.150
 Jew has, for example, then there is still 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:43.550
 a pink steady red then there is 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:46.160
 a purple with glitter even without 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:48.979
 glittering then there is a magenta tone a 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:50.810
 pink thomas it's really crazy 

00:04:48.979 --> 00:04:52.490
 many sounds and then I will too 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:55.520
 get some if you want if 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:56.930
 I'll do that again 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:58.280
 but again if you want 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:59.389
 I make such a test video 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:00.770
 that means I show you again 

00:04:59.389 --> 00:05:03.229
 lipstick after two hours four 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:04.460
 hours six hours just looks like 

00:05:03.229 --> 00:05:05.330
 you want to write that and in the 

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:06.620
 Comments 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:09.200
 but I wanted you just do it again 

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:11.030
 give the tip now necessarily because I 

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:13.850
 as I said for years past those 

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:15.470
 run and never knew that there and yes 

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:17.389
 it really is the best lipstick 

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:19.490
 because they are just the whole day 

00:05:17.389 --> 00:05:21.440
 hold and if you always the glos always 

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:22.789
 order again then trust yours 

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:26.210
 do not live out then everything is 

00:05:22.789 --> 00:05:27.440
 really wonderful and I think find 

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:29.870
 I just great so the color 

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:32.380
 I also find hammermäßig I toll 

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:35.210
 looks really nice and elegant 

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:37.669
 I love this color and the bright red 

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:39.620
 is also very beautiful and bright 

00:05:37.669 --> 00:05:42.740
 Colors are just so intense 

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:44.660
 and nice and I'll be up 

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:46.580
 every case bring some colors from and 

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:48.260
 Yes , I can give you a try 

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:49.639
 Apply all on the lips 

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:51.620
 that will be a bit difficult because 

00:05:49.639 --> 00:05:53.690
 once it's out of your lips 

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:56.240
 then you get it down hard and 

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:57.979
 then you really have that dames 

00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:00.289
 we're just on my hand everywhere here 

00:05:57.979 --> 00:06:03.470
 that can really be seen 

00:06:00.289 --> 00:06:04.789
 the skin and really embarrassed with so 

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:06.889
 a lipstick when I walk 

00:06:04.789 --> 00:06:08.630
 Apply is the evening to sleep 

00:06:06.889 --> 00:06:10.010
 I am still awaking the one 

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:12.169
 lipstick on it so that's it 

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:13.190
 Madness and that's what I wanted you to 

00:06:12.169 --> 00:06:15.680
 communicate each case 

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:17.180
 manhattan l'hebdo last the best 

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:20.479
 Lipsticks I find out of the 

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:21.610
 drogerie for the price so five euros 35 

00:06:20.479 --> 00:06:24.320
 if I said so 

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:27.620
 great the color I have is the 

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:31.760
 45 l and that keeps until bright red of julia 

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:33.600
 is the color 44 co that 's like I said 

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:35.280
 I like my color 

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:37.170
 really great look at you 

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:38.940
 if you are a bit too high 

00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:41.970
 like I'm a bit too lazy and too 

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:43.680
 sometimes straight red is just not 

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:46.560
 so if it all then everywhere 

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:50.040
 So stick to the glasses and the food 

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:50.700
 and super super super everywhere 

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:53.730
 Super 

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:54.690
 yes that was it again from me i hope 

00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:56.880
 you liked it 

00:06:54.690 --> 00:07:00.000
 As the next video is a skincare 

00:06:56.880 --> 00:07:01.440
 Routine video is then used up 

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.330
 videos come and so on like that 

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:04.950
 wish to have comments 

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:07.850
 and then i just hope you in us 

00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:07.850
