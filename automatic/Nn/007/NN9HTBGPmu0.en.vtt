00:00:01.629 --> 00:00:04.629
 in this edition it has signals 

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:08.379
 place a convenience ad 

00:00:08.379 --> 00:00:09.759
 for what 

00:00:09.759 --> 00:00:12.759
 sendme different cube 

00:00:13.359 --> 00:00:16.359
 Yes, as thousands of students are trained and Angelo Murillo 

00:00:16.999 --> 00:00:19.949
 Miami - no longer distinguishable 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:21.519
 very well colon 

00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:23.380
 and he had it 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:24.800
 how are you 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.980
 and he also distinguished himself with the brescia 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:31.029
 in most it is confused with white 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:33.290
 i do not have 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:36.140
 they can not do as in the semifinals 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.140
 think then you are you with any decal 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:42.479
 I decided to do some small 

00:00:42.479 --> 00:00:45.780
 eta balls 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.360
 in the parts of the 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.140
 the analysts 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.580
 they have 

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:54.010
 to give him another trade 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:55.350
 it is not very difficult 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.990
 what is needed are lighter 

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:00.990
 percent 

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:07.380
 to appeal to the courts 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.500
 muse has touched 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:11.920
 min 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.160
 some of the communities 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.060
 dyn 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:18.420
 the obvious what we do 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.800
 in that for example for nobody 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.110
 it's the green acting part 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:24.480
 we could 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:25.410
 we take 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:28.410
 one of these two companies 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:35.500
 we are a bit of 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.500
 contact sport 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.500
 for me by country 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:43.660
 so 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:45.630
 if we have in 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.490
 the role as 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.090
 I'm there for Perez Vine 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:53.020
 to form pictures but you can use it for this 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:54.500
 for himself 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.180
 the strongest 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:59.180
 the Romanian then noceti 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:02.970
 it would not be so fast 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:05.970
 it would not be so fast 

00:02:08.379 --> 00:02:11.519
 I hope very well and almost do not notice 

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:13.829
 and also the decal experts 

00:02:13.829 --> 00:02:17.029
 then we take this what immediately 

00:02:17.029 --> 00:02:19.089
 and how it has touched them 

00:02:19.089 --> 00:02:22.089
 ee 

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:26.479
 we look 

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:28.019
 although this drawer 

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:29.539
 stop 

00:02:29.539 --> 00:02:32.189
 it's over 

00:02:32.189 --> 00:02:35.189
 we all try 

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:40.079
 we already put her to sanchez 

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:43.079
 we remove the sticker paper 

00:02:43.889 --> 00:02:45.840
 as a set companies 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.419
 we present 

00:02:48.419 --> 00:02:50.259
 loose powder 

00:02:50.259 --> 00:02:53.259
 but very close to these it just goes like this 

00:02:54.649 --> 00:02:57.469
 percent and above you could say 

00:02:57.469 --> 00:03:00.469
 without receiving senate commented 

00:03:01.529 --> 00:03:02.590
 so 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:04.109
 percent 

00:03:04.109 --> 00:03:07.449
 stickers will be placed 

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:10.229
 to get in the center 

00:03:10.229 --> 00:03:12.739
 I'm going towards people 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:15.219
 illÃ­a want 

00:03:15.219 --> 00:03:18.289
 because this forms his style 

00:03:18.289 --> 00:03:21.799
 nor for example to remove a comma or endure this 

00:03:23.649 --> 00:03:26.099
 only the rooms will 

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:31.119
 and if it can sometimes be a bit according to your account data with your finger 

00:03:31.119 --> 00:03:34.259
 uimp photo if you want a low one wipe 

00:03:36.499 --> 00:03:39.639
 and if it really comes up with either of the two 

00:03:39.639 --> 00:03:41.139
 It can be used 

00:03:41.139 --> 00:03:44.529
 what is a little and so 

00:03:44.529 --> 00:03:46.959
 that attend 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:49.519
 bracelets and makeup 

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:51.039
 and as it says if it goes very well 

00:03:51.039 --> 00:03:52.259
 Brazil 

00:03:52.259 --> 00:03:54.499
 kelly for example and bother him 

00:03:54.499 --> 00:03:56.720
 lights and shadows in homes 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:58.239
 that's what's convenient 

00:03:58.239 --> 00:03:59.919
 i 

00:03:59.919 --> 00:04:01.329
 I do not have here 

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:03.409
 what is the orange color 

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:06.039
 so what I said could be 

00:04:06.039 --> 00:04:07.159
 pizarro 

00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:10.159
 our economy is that it no longer serves me 

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:15.189
 have the color pink delicacy 

00:04:15.189 --> 00:04:16.019
 How is it going 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:17.719
 this ball 

00:04:17.719 --> 00:04:20.719
 kirui and orange 

00:04:24.039 --> 00:04:27.039
 the paper concluded 

00:04:27.789 --> 00:04:29.300
 it requires the process 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:30.320
 silly thing 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:31.430
 to protect it 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:33.840
 the company plaza 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.219
 I do not know what has what so fast 

00:04:36.219 --> 00:04:39.219
 then tito alvarado 

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:42.749
 paper 

00:04:42.749 --> 00:04:45.749
 we place it on top of the decal 

00:04:46.599 --> 00:04:49.599
 of gea 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:52.870
 after cassel 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:54.990
 took out morsels 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:57.990
 public housing and the little ball the center 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:03.559
 the orange color 

00:05:03.559 --> 00:05:06.990
 that since he only 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:08.210
 are the colors 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:09.289
 of everything 

00:05:09.289 --> 00:05:10.409
 the rest 

00:05:10.409 --> 00:05:11.509
 of the ball 

00:05:11.509 --> 00:05:14.029
 they are decals that you no longer use 

00:05:14.029 --> 00:05:15.520
 it may be that it arrives 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:17.639
 to identify which ones 

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:20.509
 mexico df jun 

00:05:20.509 --> 00:05:23.919
 killian bushe 

00:05:23.919 --> 00:05:26.009
 it could work 

00:05:26.009 --> 00:05:27.879
 you well the colors 

00:05:27.879 --> 00:05:31.289
 and that in the pomos of the company they are all the same 

00:05:31.289 --> 00:05:34.059
 yes no yes no 

00:05:34.059 --> 00:05:37.059
 and you can confuse the poles 

00:05:39.749 --> 00:05:42.710
 only superficial without pressing 

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:45.710
 then I saw that they do the center 

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:47.729
 two people 

00:05:47.729 --> 00:05:50.680
 then there is a program 

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:53.960
 nicasio we do 

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:57.119
 he can be like this only with more edges 

00:05:57.119 --> 00:06:00.069
 in the corners and the center 

00:06:00.069 --> 00:06:01.300
 and the truth is that 

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:04.789
 a style that terraces you or can be done in 

00:06:04.789 --> 00:06:05.889
 painter com 

00:06:05.889 --> 00:06:08.889
 keep an eye on what we left 

00:06:09.479 --> 00:06:11.119
 and then it is not enough to continue 

00:06:11.119 --> 00:06:12.409
 nothing 

00:06:12.409 --> 00:06:15.509
 and that's why any decal 

00:06:15.509 --> 00:06:17.860
 the councilman but that 

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:18.550
