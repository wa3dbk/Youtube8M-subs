00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
me back to the way I was raised on

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.560 
me back to the way I was raised on
building<00:01:46.380> motorcycles<00:01:46.640> so<00:01:47.640> it's<00:01:47.820> it<00:01:48.360> was<00:01:48.450> a

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
building motorcycles so it's it was a

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.170 
building motorcycles so it's it was a
neat<00:01:48.720> combination<00:01:49.350> dice<00:01:49.590> and<00:01:49.920> I<00:01:50.010> because<00:01:50.970> he

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
neat combination dice and I because he

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.080 
neat combination dice and I because he
he<00:01:52.140> kind<00:01:52.380> of<00:01:52.440> introduced<00:01:52.830> me<00:01:53.010> to<00:01:53.190> the<00:01:53.370> new<00:01:53.850> Brad

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
he kind of introduced me to the new Brad

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.350 
he kind of introduced me to the new Brad
style<00:01:54.570> and<00:01:55.050> it's<00:01:56.040> still<00:01:56.250> got<00:01:56.430> to<00:01:56.550> still<00:01:57.210> get<00:01:57.300> a

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
style and it's still got to still get a

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.320 
style and it's still got to still get a
touch<00:01:57.600> of<00:01:57.780> the<00:01:57.960> old<00:01:58.580> bobber<00:01:59.580> chopper<00:01:59.730> time

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:00.330 
touch of the old bobber chopper time

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:04.040 
touch of the old bobber chopper time
look<00:02:00.770> the<00:02:01.770> usage<00:02:02.370> of<00:02:02.490> carbon<00:02:02.850> fiber<00:02:03.090> do<00:02:03.930> it

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:04.050 
look the usage of carbon fiber do it

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:05.750 
look the usage of carbon fiber do it
parts<00:02:04.440> is<00:02:04.620> something<00:02:05.130> unique<00:02:05.430> to<00:02:05.460> this

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:05.760 
parts is something unique to this

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:08.270 
parts is something unique to this
particular<00:02:06.000> built<00:02:06.740> we're<00:02:07.740> still<00:02:07.979> playing

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
particular built we're still playing

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.680 
particular built we're still playing
within<00:02:08.729> a<00:02:09.000> template<00:02:09.960> of<00:02:10.170> traditional<00:02:11.690> stance

but<00:02:13.140> the<00:02:13.740> introducing<00:02:14.490> those<00:02:15.740> exotic<00:02:16.740> parts<00:02:17.220> I

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
but the introducing those exotic parts I

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:18.830 
but the introducing those exotic parts I
think<00:02:17.730> that's<00:02:17.880> something<00:02:18.060> unique<00:02:18.510> to<00:02:18.540> this

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
think that's something unique to this
