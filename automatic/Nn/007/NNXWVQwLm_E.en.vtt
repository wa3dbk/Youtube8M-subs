00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
have rough knowledge of this so I'm just

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.959 
have rough knowledge of this so I'm just
going<00:00:30.449> to<00:00:30.510> give<00:00:30.689> it<00:00:30.779> a<00:00:30.840> go<00:00:31.109> basically<00:00:32.009> my<00:00:32.250> idea

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
going to give it a go basically my idea

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.850 
going to give it a go basically my idea
of<00:00:33.030> this<00:00:33.300> was<00:00:33.540> that<00:00:33.570> mega<00:00:34.350> couldn't<00:00:34.739> actually

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
of this was that mega couldn't actually

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.190 
of this was that mega couldn't actually
make<00:00:35.460> the<00:00:35.700> security<00:00:36.149> Spartan<00:00:36.540> for<00:00:36.719> a<00:00:36.750> while<00:00:36.930> I

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
make the security Spartan for a while I

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.799 
make the security Spartan for a while I
think<00:00:37.800> Bungie<00:00:38.489> before<00:00:38.879> they<00:00:39.000> made<00:00:39.180> halo<00:00:39.480> made

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
think Bungie before they made halo made

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.020 
think Bungie before they made halo made
a<00:00:39.840> game<00:00:40.110> that<00:00:40.260> used<00:00:40.559> the<00:00:40.680> security<00:00:41.160> armor<00:00:41.489> so

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
a game that used the security armor so

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.209 
a game that used the security armor so
it<00:00:42.390> was<00:00:42.540> painted<00:00:43.170> to<00:00:43.290> that<00:00:43.410> game<00:00:43.710> so<00:00:44.040> mega

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
it was painted to that game so mega

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:45.830 
it was painted to that game so mega
couldn't<00:00:44.550> touch<00:00:44.700> it<00:00:44.760> but<00:00:45.360> obviously<00:00:45.480> they've

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
couldn't touch it but obviously they've

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.479 
couldn't touch it but obviously they've
either<00:00:46.020> bought<00:00:46.320> the<00:00:46.440> patent<00:00:46.890> or<00:00:47.129> got<00:00:47.309> away

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
either bought the patent or got away

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.310 
either bought the patent or got away
with<00:00:47.670> it<00:00:47.700> or<00:00:47.879> something<00:00:48.420> but<00:00:48.870> they<00:00:48.989> have<00:00:49.110> made

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
with it or something but they have made

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.850 
with it or something but they have made
this<00:00:49.739> incredible<00:00:50.039> figure<00:00:50.730> as<00:00:51.230> the<00:00:52.230> result<00:00:52.620> and

it's it's nice to see in every

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.580 
it's it's nice to see in every
appearance<00:01:30.119> really<00:01:30.509> i'd<00:01:30.840> say<00:01:31.229> this<00:01:31.439> is<00:01:31.560> the

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
appearance really i'd say this is the

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.469 
appearance really i'd say this is the
same<00:01:31.890> as<00:01:32.009> the<00:01:32.040> grunt<00:01:32.400> from<00:01:32.520> the<00:01:32.820> ODST<00:01:33.180> buckle

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
same as the grunt from the ODST buckle

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:34.999 
same as the grunt from the ODST buckle
unit<00:01:33.720> just<00:01:33.810> to<00:01:33.900> fill<00:01:34.140> a<00:01:34.170> figure<00:01:34.530> but<00:01:34.979> i

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
unit just to fill a figure but i

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.100 
unit just to fill a figure but i
actually<00:01:35.159> don't<00:01:35.549> think<00:01:35.610> it<00:01:35.909> is<00:01:36.060> because<00:01:36.720> the

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
actually don't think it is because the

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.780 
actually don't think it is because the
UNSC<00:01:37.500> officer<00:01:37.890> we<00:01:38.040> don't<00:01:38.220> have<00:01:38.369> enough<00:01:38.610> of
