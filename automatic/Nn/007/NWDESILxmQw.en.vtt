00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.350
 and is out of life risk 

00:00:03.609 --> 00:00:07.819
 impact has caused the recognition that 

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:10.429
 did the direction of civil aeronautics 

00:00:07.819 --> 00:00:13.009
 of chili when declassifying evidence 

00:00:10.429 --> 00:00:16.039
 photographic of flying objects not 

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:19.310
 identified UFOs furrowing the sky 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:20.810
 national a surprising image shows 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:22.670
 even a bright device that 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:25.470
 moves in the sky and that until now 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:27.330
 you know what it is 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.279
 the bright light you see in this 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.129
 photography would be nothing more or nothing less 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:35.220
 that an unidentified flying object is 

00:00:32.129 --> 00:00:36.750
 say a UFO as he hears it and eye 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:38.550
 that this statement does not 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.710
 anyone but the committee of 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.050
 studies of anomalous aerial phenomena 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.629
 dependent on the general direction of 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:49.019
 civil aeronautics performs that movement 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:51.750
 ascending and descending movement thing 

00:00:49.019 --> 00:00:55.620
 that does not make a plane add a bird 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:59.250
 because they saw it perfectly that 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:01.530
 it was a disc unleashed that way they described the 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.019
 witnesses to the object sighted without a doubt 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.970
 impressive but make no mistake 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.100
 has said that in this object beings travel 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.049
 from another world although on the street when 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.180
 any mortal is asked 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:14.880
 most relationship to UFOs with 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.530
 extraterrestrials as they can be 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.440
 any type of 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:22.290
 of object as it is said 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:23.970
 extraterrestrial or terrestrial there are many 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.650
 theories about it and I think that chile 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.830
 It is a privileged place to be in the 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.720
 South end of america for the visit of 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:32.700
 beings from another planet because there is no need 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.619
 pose is not an option the image 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.420
 was captured in April 2013 by 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.850
 workers from the collahuasi mine 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.470
 almost 4,300 meters above the 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.110
 sea ​​level in the Tarapacá region 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.540
 according to the witnesses the object remained 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:48.509
 visible in the sky for almost two hours and 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:51.560
 at about 600 meters from the ground until 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:53.759
 now nobody knows what it is about 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:56.850
 We split the material that 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:58.830
 analyze in several analysts that 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.420
 work with us corresponds to a 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:02.789
 object that could not be identified 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:05.880
 in the investigating commission they assure 

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:07.830
 that since 1998 only 3 percent of 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.780
 the reported sightings in the country 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:12.450
 they were labeled as a flying object 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.340
 unidentified to get to this 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.930
 conclusion a series of 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:18.810
 rigorous analyzes that usually 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:21.530
 identifying the object end which 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:24.350
 in this case it was not possible to do 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:28.700
 most of them are birds is a 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:30.620
 bird is perfectly a UFO for the 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:33.620
 people who do not know and people do not have 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:35.870
 why know because they do not have say 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.910
 the expertise but you have if you have it 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:39.890
 are precisely those who work in the 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:41.420
 air that's why we consulted several 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:44.180
 commercial pilots if ever 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:46.670
 while flying they saw a UFO he never 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:48.980
 I had an unidentified one never in my 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:50.569
 life and another person 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:52.160
 I have had suspicions but then I have 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:54.230
 checked in the center against 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.910
 air traffic and it was not an airplane 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:57.350
 let's say he was under his control in 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:00.940
 one by the way, the best of the pilots 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:00.940
 has seen some things went 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:05.650
 so things for ufologists 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:07.780
 recognitions like this one speak of a 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:10.989
 opening of governments and states 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:12.580
 to the extraterrestrial theme I know that the cfi 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:15.099
 has better cases than what they have 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:18.250
 shown and that we hope sometime that 

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:19.780
 but make them known and this progress 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:21.730
 important especially a photograph that 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.680
 it's physical evidence but the truth 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:25.660
 is that so far we can only affirm 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:28.299
 that this would be a flying object not 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:31.110
 identified the rest is left for the 

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:31.110
 imagination
