because I know we got really good stuff
he's<00:00:42.120> got<00:00:42.180> a<00:00:42.300> really<00:00:42.480> good<00:00:42.570> purple<00:00:43.079> a<00:00:43.290> really

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
he's got a really good purple a really

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.979 
he's got a really good purple a really
powerful<00:00:44.160> foul<00:00:44.610> school<00:00:44.969> I<00:00:45.180> know<00:00:45.780> he's<00:00:45.960> a

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
powerful foul school I know he's a

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.330 
powerful foul school I know he's a
really<00:00:46.200> good<00:00:46.320> picture<00:00:46.469> so<00:00:46.739> i<00:00:46.770> had<00:00:47.010> to<00:00:47.129> trade

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
really good picture so i had to trade

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:48.619 
really good picture so i had to trade
for<00:00:47.489> him<00:00:47.670> and<00:00:47.910> i<00:00:47.969> figured<00:00:48.239> he<00:00:48.360> could<00:00:48.510> actually

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
for him and i figured he could actually

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.540 
for him and i figured he could actually
remove<00:00:48.989> role<00:00:49.230> as<00:00:49.379> like<00:00:49.620> a<00:00:49.649> number<00:00:49.950> two<00:00:50.129> guy<00:00:50.309> on

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
remove role as like a number two guy on

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.490 
remove role as like a number two guy on
rotation<00:00:50.940> and<00:00:51.629> i<00:00:51.840> figured<00:00:52.140> it<00:00:52.199> was<00:00:52.289> a<00:00:52.320> pretty

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
rotation and i figured it was a pretty

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.170 
rotation and i figured it was a pretty
good<00:00:52.649> idea<00:00:52.739> to<00:00:53.010> move<00:00:53.160> up<00:00:53.370> two<00:00:53.610> slots<00:00:53.910> with<00:00:54.149> a

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
good idea to move up two slots with a

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.119 
good idea to move up two slots with a
rotation<00:00:54.510> picture<00:00:54.930> went<00:00:55.559> all<00:00:55.739> i<00:00:55.770> had<00:00:55.920> to<00:00:56.010> do

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129

of<00:00:57.989> my<00:00:58.109> idea<00:00:58.140> there<00:00:58.730> so<00:00:59.730> with<00:01:00.660> me<00:01:00.809> trading<00:01:01.050> for

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
how he's doing in the first game now

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:07.460 
how he's doing in the first game now
right<00:01:06.420> here<00:01:06.689> he<00:01:06.810> seemed<00:01:06.990> got<00:01:07.110> Billy<00:01:07.320> Hamilton

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
right here he seemed got Billy Hamilton

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.289 
right here he seemed got Billy Hamilton
off<00:01:07.770> first<00:01:07.950> base<00:01:08.130> and<00:01:08.460> just<00:01:08.580> time<00:01:08.820> to<00:01:08.850> get<00:01:09.119> some

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
off first base and just time to get some

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.380 
off first base and just time to get some
steals<00:01:10.100> or<00:01:11.100> is<00:01:11.310> it<00:01:11.490> he<00:01:11.700> gets<00:01:11.880> picked<00:01:12.150> off<00:01:12.240> on

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
steals or is it he gets picked off on

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:13.969 
steals or is it he gets picked off on
the<00:01:12.570> very<00:01:12.750> first<00:01:12.960> pitch<00:01:13.229> I<00:01:13.500> don't<00:01:13.680> really<00:01:13.799> know

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
the very first pitch I don't really know

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.560 
the very first pitch I don't really know
what<00:01:14.100> happened<00:01:14.189> there<00:01:14.520> I<00:01:14.790> guess<00:01:15.270> the<00:01:15.390> game

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
what happened there I guess the game

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:16.760 
what happened there I guess the game
doesn't<00:01:15.810> really<00:01:16.049> respect<00:01:16.409> his<00:01:16.560> 99

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
doesn't really respect his 99

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.289 
doesn't really respect his 99
baserunning<00:01:17.310> ability<00:01:17.430> because<00:01:17.909> he<00:01:18.180> got

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
baserunning ability because he got

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.270 
baserunning ability because he got
picked<00:01:18.540> off<00:01:18.720> on<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.170> very<00:01:19.439> first<00:01:19.619> pitch<00:01:19.860> he

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
picked off on the very first pitch he

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.560 
picked off on the very first pitch he

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
strikes on the last batter looking with

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.590 
strikes on the last batter looking with
a<00:01:46.350> fastball<00:01:46.409> in<00:01:46.829> the<00:01:46.890> corners<00:01:47.220> with<00:01:47.939> his

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
a fastball in the corners with his

a fastball in the corners with his
fastball<00:01:48.990> when<00:01:49.799> I've<00:01:50.130> used<00:01:50.310> them<00:01:50.430> twice<00:01:50.640> so

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
fastball when I've used them twice so

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.429 
fastball when I've used them twice so
far<00:01:51.000> one<00:01:51.630> thing<00:01:51.780> I've<00:01:51.869> noticed<00:01:51.960> is<00:01:52.110> fastball

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
far one thing I've noticed is fastball

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.410 
far one thing I've noticed is fastball
is<00:01:52.619> like<00:01:52.920> pinpoint<00:01:53.430> accuracy<00:01:53.880> so<00:01:54.180> I've<00:01:54.240> had<00:01:54.390> a

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
is like pinpoint accuracy so I've had a

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.170 
is like pinpoint accuracy so I've had a
lot<00:01:54.689> of<00:01:54.750> a<00:01:55.259> lot<00:01:55.530> of<00:01:55.590> good<00:01:55.909> strikeouts<00:01:56.909> and<00:01:57.119> a

lot of a lot of good strikeouts and a
lot<00:01:57.360> of<00:01:57.390> really<00:01:57.840> digital<00:01:58.290> app<00:01:58.409> outs<00:01:58.680> or<00:01:58.979> good

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
lot of really digital app outs or good

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.100 
lot of really digital app outs or good
pitching<00:01:59.939> situations<00:02:00.540> just<00:02:00.719> against<00:02:01.049> the

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
pitching situations just against the

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.760 
pitching situations just against the
fastball<00:02:02.869> can<00:02:03.869> hit<00:02:03.990> the<00:02:04.110> corners<00:02:04.469> which<00:02:04.649> is

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
fastball can hit the corners which is

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.679 
fastball can hit the corners which is
really<00:02:04.979> important<00:02:05.490> right<00:02:06.240> here<00:02:06.390> you<00:02:06.450> see<00:02:06.600> we

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:20.079 
second and get him over to third base

00:02:20.079 --> 00:02:21.479 
second and get him over to third base
cuz<00:02:20.379> I<00:02:20.439> ends<00:02:20.620> up<00:02:20.680> hurting<00:02:20.890> us<00:02:21.069> because<00:02:21.400> he

cuz I ends up hurting us because he

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:22.589 
cuz I ends up hurting us because he
actually<00:02:21.640> is<00:02:21.819> thrown<00:02:22.030> out<00:02:22.150> by<00:02:22.209> the<00:02:22.390> first

00:02:22.589 --> 00:02:22.599 
actually is thrown out by the first

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:25.229 
actually is thrown out by the first
baseman<00:02:22.810> I<00:02:23.170> mean<00:02:23.860> you<00:02:24.129> just<00:02:24.370> there's<00:02:24.939> nothing

00:02:25.229 --> 00:02:25.239 
baseman I mean you just there's nothing

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:26.369 
baseman I mean you just there's nothing
worse<00:02:25.390> than<00:02:25.480> getting<00:02:25.569> thrown<00:02:25.900> by<00:02:26.110> a<00:02:26.140> first

00:02:26.369 --> 00:02:26.379 
worse than getting thrown by a first

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:28.410 
worse than getting thrown by a first
baseman<00:02:26.470> because<00:02:27.010> realistically<00:02:27.879> the<00:02:28.209> first

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
baseman because realistically the first

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:29.490 
baseman because realistically the first
baseman<00:02:28.569> shouldn't<00:02:28.930> be<00:02:28.989> able<00:02:29.079> to<00:02:29.230> figure<00:02:29.349> out

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
baseman shouldn't be able to figure out

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.649 
baseman shouldn't be able to figure out
like<00:02:29.709> that<00:02:29.890> their<00:02:30.189> job<00:02:30.400> is<00:02:30.430> to<00:02:30.579> catch<00:02:30.819> so<00:02:31.510> when

00:02:31.649 --> 00:02:31.659 
like that their job is to catch so when

00:02:31.659 --> 00:02:32.640 
like that their job is to catch so when
you<00:02:31.750> get<00:02:31.870> thrown<00:02:32.049> out<00:02:32.170> by<00:02:32.290> the<00:02:32.349> first<00:02:32.530> base

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
you get thrown out by the first base

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:34.289 
you get thrown out by the first base
when<00:02:32.920> you<00:02:33.010> just<00:02:33.250> know<00:02:33.370> you<00:02:33.400> messed<00:02:33.700> up<00:02:33.939> as<00:02:34.150> the

00:02:34.289 --> 00:02:34.299 
when you just know you messed up as the

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:35.309 
when you just know you messed up as the
codes<00:02:34.510> because<00:02:34.689> I<00:02:34.810> probably<00:02:35.019> should<00:02:35.290> have

00:02:35.309 --> 00:02:35.319 
codes because I probably should have

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:37.770 
codes because I probably should have
just<00:02:35.409> kept<00:02:35.709> my<00:02:35.799> second<00:02:36.280> luckily<00:02:37.239> it<00:02:37.420> hangs

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
just kept my second luckily it hangs

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:39.569 
just kept my second luckily it hangs
i'll<00:02:37.930> end<00:02:38.079> up<00:02:38.140> working<00:02:38.319> Alex<00:02:38.680> right<00:02:38.829> here<00:02:39.129> the

i'll end up working Alex right here the

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:41.069 
i'll end up working Alex right here the
guy<00:02:39.700> on<00:02:39.819> second<00:02:40.060> ends<00:02:40.180> up<00:02:40.239> the<00:02:40.329> score<00:02:40.599> but<00:02:40.870> when

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:41.079 
guy on second ends up the score but when

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:42.569 
guy on second ends up the score but when
you<00:02:41.170> think<00:02:41.379> about<00:02:41.439> it<00:02:41.590> if<00:02:41.799> I<00:02:41.859> left<00:02:42.069> that<00:02:42.220> man<00:02:42.430> on

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:42.579 
you think about it if I left that man on

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:44.670 
you think about it if I left that man on
second<00:02:43.060> and<00:02:43.209> I<00:02:43.900> didn't<00:02:44.170> let<00:02:44.260> him<00:02:44.349> get<00:02:44.470> thrown

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
second and I didn't let him get thrown

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:45.809 
second and I didn't let him get thrown
out<00:02:44.799> at<00:02:44.859> third<00:02:44.889> he<00:02:45.250> would<00:02:45.370> have<00:02:45.459> came<00:02:45.609> around

00:02:45.809 --> 00:02:45.819

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:47.580 
out at third he would have came around
to<00:02:45.909> score<00:02:46.000> as<00:02:46.269> well<00:02:46.450> which<00:02:47.049> would<00:02:47.290> have<00:02:47.379> led<00:02:47.470> to

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
to score as well which would have led to

that<00:03:17.410> ball<00:03:17.680> up<00:03:17.829> I<00:03:17.919> was<00:03:18.069> trying<00:03:18.280> to<00:03:18.340> keep<00:03:18.430> it

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:21.449 
that ball up I was trying to keep it
safe<00:03:18.790> and<00:03:19.030> just<00:03:19.120> make<00:03:20.109> sure<00:03:20.139> that<00:03:20.560> no<00:03:21.040> run<00:03:21.250> came

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:21.459 
safe and just make sure that no run came

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:22.890 
safe and just make sure that no run came
by<00:03:21.639> because<00:03:21.699> for<00:03:22.060> all<00:03:22.120> we<00:03:22.239> know<00:03:22.389> if<00:03:22.510> I<00:03:22.569> mess<00:03:22.780> up

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900 
by because for all we know if I mess up

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:24.059 
by because for all we know if I mess up
all<00:03:23.079> it<00:03:23.260> probably<00:03:23.590> would<00:03:23.680> have<00:03:23.709> rolled<00:03:23.889> all

00:03:24.059 --> 00:03:24.069 
all it probably would have rolled all

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:26.309 
all it probably would have rolled all
the<00:03:24.099> way<00:03:24.160> to<00:03:24.280> the<00:03:24.370> fins<00:03:24.930> so<00:03:25.930> right<00:03:26.079> here<00:03:26.260> you

00:03:26.309 --> 00:03:26.319 
the way to the fins so right here you

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:27.539 
the way to the fins so right here you
see<00:03:26.440> there's<00:03:26.620> two<00:03:26.739> outs<00:03:26.889> of<00:03:27.069> man<00:03:27.159> on<00:03:27.280> first<00:03:27.459> and

00:03:27.539 --> 00:03:27.549 
see there's two outs of man on first and

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:28.470 
see there's two outs of man on first and
second<00:03:27.909> this<00:03:28.000> is<00:03:28.090> one<00:03:28.180> of<00:03:28.209> those<00:03:28.329> situations

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:28.480 
second this is one of those situations

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:31.229 
second this is one of those situations
where<00:03:28.870> you<00:03:28.989> really<00:03:29.319> need<00:03:29.470> to<00:03:29.530> get<00:03:29.650> out<00:03:29.889> and<00:03:30.310> you

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:31.239 
where you really need to get out and you

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:32.369 
where you really need to get out and you

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:34.110 
see right here we got a few nights
pitches<00:03:32.769> there's<00:03:33.040> a<00:03:33.099> pretty<00:03:33.340> big<00:03:33.519> at-bat<00:03:33.909> so

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.230 
that's kind of a reasoning for showing

to be able to come down with that one he

00:05:35.599 --> 00:05:37.029 
to be able to come down with that one he
jumps<00:05:35.960> up<00:05:36.080> thinking<00:05:36.530> any<00:05:36.650> other<00:05:36.860> opportunity

00:05:37.029 --> 00:05:37.039 
jumps up thinking any other opportunity

00:05:37.039 --> 00:05:38.830 
jumps up thinking any other opportunity
to<00:05:37.370> catch<00:05:37.550> it<00:05:37.729> but<00:05:37.880> Giancarlo<00:05:38.389> Stanton<00:05:38.660> today

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:38.840 
to catch it but Giancarlo Stanton today

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:40.870 
to catch it but Giancarlo Stanton today
just<00:05:39.289> far<00:05:39.530> enough<00:05:39.620> for<00:05:40.340> it<00:05:40.430> to<00:05:40.460> carry<00:05:40.729> out<00:05:40.849> of

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:40.880 
just far enough for it to carry out of

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:42.070 
just far enough for it to carry out of
the<00:05:41.000> ballpark<00:05:41.030> so<00:05:41.539> we<00:05:41.599> got<00:05:41.720> a<00:05:41.750> little<00:05:41.900> bit

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:42.080 
the ballpark so we got a little bit

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:44.379 
the ballpark so we got a little bit
lucky<00:05:42.320> on<00:05:42.410> that<00:05:42.470> one<00:05:42.590> but<00:05:43.550> now<00:05:43.699> we<00:05:44.120> are<00:05:44.150> only

00:05:44.379 --> 00:05:44.389 
lucky on that one but now we are only

00:05:44.389 --> 00:05:46.570 
lucky on that one but now we are only
down<00:05:44.570> by<00:05:44.630> two<00:05:44.750> runs<00:05:44.930> that's<00:05:45.320> a<00:05:45.470> very<00:05:45.830> big<00:05:46.160> start

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:46.580 
down by two runs that's a very big start

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:47.740 
down by two runs that's a very big start
the<00:05:46.699> inning<00:05:46.849> so<00:05:47.090> that's<00:05:47.240> exactly<00:05:47.539> what<00:05:47.690> I

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:47.750 
the inning so that's exactly what I

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:49.930 
the inning so that's exactly what I
wanted<00:05:48.310> sadly<00:05:49.310> right<00:05:49.460> there<00:05:49.610> you<00:05:49.729> see<00:05:49.849> they

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:49.940 
wanted sadly right there you see they

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:52.270 
wanted sadly right there you see they
brought<00:05:50.180> in<00:05:50.330> a<00:05:50.419> new<00:05:50.449> pitcher<00:05:51.380> and<00:05:51.620> he

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:52.280 
brought in a new pitcher and he

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:53.770 
brought in a new pitcher and he
definitely<00:05:52.639> closed<00:05:53.090> down<00:05:53.240> the<00:05:53.360> door<00:05:53.539> for<00:05:53.750> us

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:53.780 
definitely closed down the door for us

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:55.360 
definitely closed down the door for us
maintaining<00:05:54.320> at<00:05:54.500> the<00:05:54.620> very<00:05:54.830> next<00:05:55.070> three

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:55.370 
maintaining at the very next three

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:58.000 
maintaining at the very next three
hitters<00:05:55.550> got<00:05:56.360> our<00:05:56.570> in<00:05:56.930> succession<00:05:57.500> so<00:05:57.830> that's

00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:58.010 
hitters got our in succession so that's

00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:00.070 
hitters got our in succession so that's
not<00:05:58.190> good<00:05:58.370> for<00:05:58.550> us<00:05:58.669> I<00:05:58.970> can<00:05:59.570> do<00:05:59.630> now<00:05:59.780> have<00:05:59.870> to<00:05:59.960> go

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:00.080 
not good for us I can do now have to go

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:01.420 
not good for us I can do now have to go
into<00:06:00.229> the<00:06:00.320> bomb<00:06:00.530> the<00:06:00.650> ninth<00:06:00.800> inning<00:06:01.130> with<00:06:01.310> our

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:01.430 
into the bomb the ninth inning with our

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:04.390 
into the bomb the ninth inning with our
bottom<00:06:02.150> three<00:06:02.360> hitters<00:06:02.630> batting<00:06:02.840> and<00:06:03.710> with

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:04.400

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:05.870 
their closing pitcher on the mound so

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:07.180 
their closing pitcher on the mound so
that's<00:06:06.050> got<00:06:06.169> a<00:06:06.199> little<00:06:06.289> bit<00:06:06.500> scary<00:06:06.800> to<00:06:06.890> globe

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:07.190 
that's got a little bit scary to globe

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:08.620 
that's got a little bit scary to globe
the<00:06:07.310> deadly

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:08.630 
the deadly

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:10.060 
the deadly
and<00:06:08.750> it's<00:06:08.870> not<00:06:08.990> a<00:06:09.050> good<00:06:09.170> situation<00:06:09.230> for<00:06:09.710> us<00:06:09.860> is

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:10.070 
and it's not a good situation for us is

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:11.410 
and it's not a good situation for us is
the<00:06:10.220> first<00:06:10.460> batter<00:06:10.640> is<00:06:10.760> going<00:06:10.910> to<00:06:10.970> ground<00:06:11.210> out

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:11.420 
the first batter is going to ground out

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:13.720 
the first batter is going to ground out
on<00:06:11.840> a<00:06:11.900> 22<00:06:12.260> cal<00:06:12.560> now<00:06:12.830> we're<00:06:12.980> in<00:06:13.070> an<00:06:13.130> 02<00:06:13.280> count

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:13.730 
on a 22 cal now we're in an 02 count

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:15.240 
on a 22 cal now we're in an 02 count
this<00:06:13.850> is<00:06:13.910> not<00:06:14.180> a<00:06:14.210> good<00:06:14.390> situation<00:06:14.450> to<00:06:14.840> be<00:06:14.900> in

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:15.250 
this is not a good situation to be in

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:17.590 
this is not a good situation to be in
hopefully<00:06:16.250> you<00:06:16.310> get<00:06:16.610> on<00:06:16.760> base<00:06:17.000> but<00:06:17.330> that<00:06:17.480> would

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:17.600 
hopefully you get on base but that would

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:19.780 
hopefully you get on base but that would
not<00:06:17.630> be<00:06:17.810> the<00:06:18.050> case<00:06:18.230> as<00:06:18.500> rice<00:06:19.250> here<00:06:19.490> he's<00:06:19.670> going

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:19.790 
not be the case as rice here he's going

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:21.840 
not be the case as rice here he's going
to<00:06:19.910> strike<00:06:20.030> out<00:06:20.300> on<00:06:20.510> a<00:06:20.660> high<00:06:20.990> inside<00:06:21.530> fastball

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:21.850 
to strike out on a high inside fastball

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:25.300 
to strike out on a high inside fastball
so<00:06:22.850> next<00:06:23.120> up<00:06:23.390> we<00:06:24.320> got<00:06:24.350> last<00:06:24.620> hitter<00:06:24.920> I<00:06:24.980> believe

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:25.310 
so next up we got last hitter I believe

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:27.580 
so next up we got last hitter I believe
this<00:06:25.460> Danny<00:06:26.150> Hechavarria<00:06:26.870> not<00:06:27.260> a<00:06:27.290> very<00:06:27.530> good

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:27.590
