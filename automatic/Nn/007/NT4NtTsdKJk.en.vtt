00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.609
 mac but i also have 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.859
 download a maximum tomorrow for you 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:28.470
 so you will have maps as I am 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.150
 here templeton so it does not hurt me that 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.899
 I have already tested honey is for memory 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:36.540
 accor at once you will have a map 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.460
 present and skype you will have if my part 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.770
 games so that's really not bad 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.620
 you will have two mac mini games you will have 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:46.789
 my amusement park you will hurt my 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:49.170
 paint ball you will also 

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:51.809
 I do not know what I meant 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:55.020
 you will have a brief you will have in everything 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.600
 case full of maps so full of maps 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.039
 you will really have a lot 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:01.170
 so here I will introduce you a little bit 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:03.030
 templeton because I like doing it 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.880
 I find rather a lot so the 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.020
 first levels are pretty easy but 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:11.400
 you will see that in the end they are 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:13.830
 extremely hard so to go to 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.220
 go through the air games if you 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:19.409
 make it to and you're the other 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:21.540
 in most I believe because I believe I 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.909
 believe that I tested them all except one 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.799
 but in most will have a system 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:30.840
 where it will be necessary to teleport people in 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:32.909
 little kind of cage and go into 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:36.299
 kinds of cages and in fact will 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:39.240
 then activate levers forgiveness of 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:41.490
 levers that will do that well it's going 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:45.200
 raise the boxes where they are the 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:47.659
 blocks where they are so so 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.649
 the other one has to do it so 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:50.780
 it's to warn you 

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:55.640
 you do not forget about yourself 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:57.259
 wait here is then in the 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:01.250
 same prison and sketches you summarize a 

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:03.229
 little bit in the game ben actually it's you 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:07.310
 will you gonna be in a jail at the 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:09.229
 base you will have to escape in 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.840
 find levers from the torches of 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:15.799
 redstone and all the whole thing like 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:17.000
 so that in the mcl ben actually there 

00:02:15.799 --> 00:02:19.700
 will have hidden levers that they will 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.760
 access secret doors or something 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:25.430
 well styled you will also have tomorrow 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:27.670
 course so a course map really 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:30.019
 hardcore body already the first level c 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:32.690
 I did not even manage to pass it I had to 

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:35.150
 wait extremely long because he 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:36.560
 is really super hard this thing to one of 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.870
 pistons but the pistons and they go there 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.069
 to lose quickly must jump on a piston 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:42.349
 who jumped on lot by the way I think 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:44.900
 that it's impossible since me the end 

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:48.590
 I wear that but I have 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:50.900
 not too successful if not in the other hand 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:56.359
 by courtanet and hardcore gaming is 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:03:03.400
 quite simple how do I zoom in on 

00:02:56.359 --> 00:03:06.700
 sauces and a13 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:08.920
 she's dying here so that's it I think 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:11.079
 I did a little around all 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:12.579
 the hands that go that have to be in the 

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:14.920
 description so in passing in the 

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:18.579
 description you will have a file 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:20.560
 mediafire so the file mediafire b 

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:23.620
 you download it and then it will take 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:25.900
 that you go to the file that you 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:28.659
 take your usb key and tomorrow for the 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:30.489
 wound and that you open the file 

00:03:28.659 --> 00:03:32.319
 and inside the file there will be 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:35.200
 all the maps so especially you do not 

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:36.760
 do not put the file in it in your 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.139
 usb key it will be necessary to put just 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:40.709
 only brands because if you 

00:03:38.139 --> 00:03:43.239
 put the file none of the maps neuvas 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:45.310
 neuvas counted in your pleases 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:46.440
 so here I think I did a little 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:48.700
 round 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:51.939

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:53.829
 video so i'm going to put you the 

00:03:51.939 --> 00:03:56.409
 file in the description so that 

00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:58.659
 promise especially why so I hope 

00:03:56.409 --> 00:04:00.670
 that you will like the mac are not 

00:03:58.659 --> 00:04:03.220

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:07.629
 little everyone 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:09.579

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:11.739
 ask if there is make take their 

00:04:09.579 --> 00:04:13.660

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:16.049
 only for europe 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:18.970

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:20.289
 not for Americans us 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:21.789
