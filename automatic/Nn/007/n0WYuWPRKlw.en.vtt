actually<00:02:02.399> fit<00:02:02.939> together<00:02:03.530> perfectly<00:02:04.759> I'm

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
actually fit together perfectly I'm

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.059 
actually fit together perfectly I'm
going<00:02:05.909> to<00:02:05.969> put<00:02:06.149> the<00:02:06.329> bow<00:02:07.110> maybe<00:02:07.619> I<00:02:07.680> can<00:02:07.860> do<00:02:08.009> it

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
going to put the bow maybe I can do it

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.369 
going to put the bow maybe I can do it
with<00:02:08.190> one<00:02:08.369> hand<00:02:08.399> here<00:02:08.879> I<00:02:09.060> put<00:02:09.840> this<00:02:09.959> up<00:02:10.200> like

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
with one hand here I put this up like

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:13.070 
with one hand here I put this up like
this<00:02:10.440> and<00:02:11.250> I<00:02:11.760> try<00:02:12.150> and<00:02:12.300> get<00:02:12.450> this<00:02:12.599> in<00:02:12.810> there<00:02:12.959> you

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
this and I try and get this in there you

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.400 
this and I try and get this in there you
see

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
see

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.010 
see
sort<00:02:13.650> of<00:02:13.790> don't<00:02:14.790> quite<00:02:15.300> come<00:02:15.810> together

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
sort of don't quite come together

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.290 
sort of don't quite come together
perfectly<00:02:16.500> the<00:02:17.430> problem<00:02:17.880> is<00:02:17.970> that<00:02:18.150> the

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
perfectly the problem is that the

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.110 
perfectly the problem is that the
interior<00:02:18.750> diameter<00:02:18.960> is<00:02:19.560> I<00:02:19.920> don't<00:02:20.490> know<00:02:20.760> an

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
interior diameter is I don't know an

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.760 
interior diameter is I don't know an
eighth<00:02:21.390> of<00:02:21.420> an<00:02:21.660> inch<00:02:21.750> shy<00:02:22.050> or<00:02:22.320> something<00:02:22.470> like

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
eighth of an inch shy or something like

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:25.610 
eighth of an inch shy or something like
that<00:02:22.830> so<00:02:23.280> my<00:02:23.940> plan<00:02:24.210> right<00:02:24.480> now<00:02:24.510> is<00:02:24.690> to<00:02:25.050> grind

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
that so my plan right now is to grind

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.590 
that so my plan right now is to grind
the<00:02:25.920> inside<00:02:26.340> down<00:02:26.580> with<00:02:26.880> a<00:02:26.910> dremel<00:02:27.240> on<00:02:27.450> the

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
the inside down with a dremel on the

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.900 
the inside down with a dremel on the
grinding<00:02:27.990> tool<00:02:28.170> you<00:02:28.860> know<00:02:28.950> just<00:02:29.340> enough<00:02:29.730> so

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
grinding tool you know just enough so

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:31.850 
grinding tool you know just enough so
that<00:02:29.940> this<00:02:30.210> thing<00:02:30.270> fits<00:02:30.750> snugly<00:02:31.320> inside<00:02:31.470> there

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
that this thing fits snugly inside there

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.740 
that this thing fits snugly inside there
I<00:02:31.890> want<00:02:32.100> to<00:02:32.310> sort<00:02:32.490> of<00:02:32.580> connect<00:02:32.940> and<00:02:33.480> then

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
I want to sort of connect and then

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.340 
I want to sort of connect and then
basically<00:02:34.680> you'll<00:02:35.310> have<00:02:35.400> a<00:02:35.550> shelf<00:02:36.000> sorry<00:02:36.350> yeah

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
basically you'll have a shelf sorry yeah

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:38.840 
basically you'll have a shelf sorry yeah
you'll<00:02:37.770> have<00:02:37.920> a<00:02:37.950> shell<00:02:38.250> that<00:02:38.490> kinda<00:02:38.730> looks

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 
you'll have a shell that kinda looks

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:41.180 
you'll have a shell that kinda looks
like<00:02:38.910> that<00:02:39.240> slightly<00:02:39.890> thinner<00:02:40.890> because

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
like that slightly thinner because

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.580 
like that slightly thinner because
they'll<00:02:41.550> actually<00:02:41.850> couple<00:02:42.360> together<00:02:42.540> and<00:02:43.470> I

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
they'll actually couple together and I

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.380 
they'll actually couple together and I
think<00:02:43.650> that<00:02:43.920> will<00:02:44.070> look<00:02:44.190> really<00:02:44.250> cool<00:02:44.670> so<00:02:45.270> in

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
think that will look really cool so in

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:46.970 
think that will look really cool so in
the<00:02:45.480> back<00:02:45.690> here<00:02:45.990> I'm<00:02:46.140> going<00:02:46.260> to<00:02:46.350> drill<00:02:46.620> a<00:02:46.920> hole

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
the back here I'm going to drill a hole

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.550 
the back here I'm going to drill a hole
for<00:02:47.520> the<00:02:47.580> quarter-inch<00:02:48.240> jack<00:02:48.660> on<00:02:49.290> the<00:02:49.410> other

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
for the quarter-inch jack on the other

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.080 
for the quarter-inch jack on the other
side<00:02:49.770> I<00:02:49.800> got<00:02:50.100> the<00:02:50.220> volume<00:02:50.490> control<00:02:50.820> I'm<00:02:50.910> gonna

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
side I got the volume control I'm gonna

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.570 
side I got the volume control I'm gonna
take<00:02:51.270> the<00:02:51.390> guts<00:02:51.630> out<00:02:51.870> of<00:02:51.930> this<00:02:52.170> mic<00:02:52.410> ditch<00:02:53.280> this

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
take the guts out of this mic ditch this

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:57.500 
take the guts out of this mic ditch this
shell<00:02:53.820> completely<00:02:54.890> and<00:02:55.890> then<00:02:56.250> put<00:02:57.150> the<00:02:57.240> guts

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
shell completely and then put the guts

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.960 
shell completely and then put the guts
inside<00:02:58.020> there<00:02:58.320> so<00:02:58.680> inside<00:02:59.220> this<00:02:59.460> will<00:02:59.730> be<00:02:59.820> the

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
inside there so inside this will be the

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.420 
inside there so inside this will be the
jack<00:03:00.270> and<00:03:00.570> the<00:03:00.690> pot<00:03:00.930> and<00:03:01.230> then<00:03:01.860> the<00:03:01.980> element

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
jack and the pot and then the element

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.310 
jack and the pot and then the element
I'm<00:03:02.610> going<00:03:02.820> to<00:03:02.880> nestle<00:03:03.270> down<00:03:03.300> inside<00:03:04.020> there

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:04.320 
I'm going to nestle down inside there

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:07.850 
I'm going to nestle down inside there
and<00:03:04.530> this<00:03:05.250> thing<00:03:05.550> I'm<00:03:05.700> going<00:03:05.850> to<00:03:05.940> drill<00:03:06.860> holes

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
and this thing I'm going to drill holes

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:10.370 
and this thing I'm going to drill holes
all<00:03:08.280> around<00:03:08.400> it<00:03:08.790> so<00:03:09.060> it'll<00:03:09.480> make<00:03:09.600> a<00:03:09.660> nice<00:03:09.930> like

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
all around it so it'll make a nice like

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:12.950 
all around it so it'll make a nice like
a<00:03:10.410> nice<00:03:10.620> little<00:03:10.770> grill<00:03:11.130> shape<00:03:11.400> so<00:03:12.210> this<00:03:12.600> time<00:03:12.810> I

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:12.960 
a nice little grill shape so this time I

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:14.660 
a nice little grill shape so this time I
actually<00:03:13.020> took<00:03:13.350> the<00:03:13.500> time<00:03:13.740> to<00:03:14.010> lay<00:03:14.220> out<00:03:14.430> some

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
actually took the time to lay out some

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:19.160 
actually took the time to lay out some
holes<00:03:15.170> used<00:03:16.170> a<00:03:16.320> ruler<00:03:16.640> and<00:03:17.640> a<00:03:18.000> compass<00:03:18.510> to<00:03:18.930> set

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
holes used a ruler and a compass to set

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:21.620 
holes used a ruler and a compass to set
a<00:03:19.200> couple<00:03:19.470> of<00:03:19.680> concentric<00:03:20.160> circles<00:03:20.730> and<00:03:21.120> then

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
a couple of concentric circles and then

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:24.140 
a couple of concentric circles and then
April<00:03:22.080> I<00:03:22.470> can't<00:03:22.800> see<00:03:23.100> cuz<00:03:23.400> the<00:03:23.520> quality<00:03:23.940> of<00:03:24.000> my

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
April I can't see cuz the quality of my

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:25.820 
April I can't see cuz the quality of my
video<00:03:24.450> is<00:03:24.510> not<00:03:24.750> very<00:03:24.930> good<00:03:25.080> but<00:03:25.320> I<00:03:25.410> put<00:03:25.680> you

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:25.830 
video is not very good but I put you

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:29.390 
video is not very good but I put you
know<00:03:25.950> I've<00:03:26.370> used<00:03:26.610> the<00:03:26.880> a<00:03:27.690> sharp<00:03:28.200> point<00:03:28.709> of<00:03:28.980> my

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
know I've used the a sharp point of my

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.080 
know I've used the a sharp point of my
compass<00:03:30.180> here<00:03:30.390> sort<00:03:31.110> of<00:03:31.200> poke<00:03:31.440> holes<00:03:32.000> in<00:03:33.000> the

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
compass here sort of poke holes in the

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:34.880 
compass here sort of poke holes in the
areas<00:03:33.450> I<00:03:33.540> want<00:03:33.690> so<00:03:33.930> I<00:03:33.959> made<00:03:34.200> two<00:03:34.470> concentric

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
areas I want so I made two concentric

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:37.220 
areas I want so I made two concentric
circles<00:03:35.370> then<00:03:36.000> I<00:03:36.120> use<00:03:36.330> this<00:03:36.540> thing<00:03:36.600> sort<00:03:37.170> of

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
circles then I use this thing sort of

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:39.199 
circles then I use this thing sort of
lay<00:03:37.470> out<00:03:37.680> a<00:03:37.709> pattern<00:03:38.280> so<00:03:38.550> that<00:03:38.580> they<00:03:38.820> fit<00:03:39.060> into

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:39.209 
lay out a pattern so that they fit into

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:41.000 
lay out a pattern so that they fit into
it<00:03:39.450> and<00:03:39.720> I'm<00:03:40.110> basically<00:03:40.440> going<00:03:40.740> to<00:03:40.800> use<00:03:40.980> a

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
it and I'm basically going to use a

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:44.090 
it and I'm basically going to use a
small<00:03:41.490> diameter<00:03:42.239> drill<00:03:42.630> bit<00:03:42.930> I'm<00:03:43.830> not

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:44.100 
small diameter drill bit I'm not

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:47.780 
small diameter drill bit I'm not
entirely<00:03:44.340> sure<00:03:44.520> yet<00:03:44.959> how<00:03:45.959> maybe<00:03:46.500> eight<00:03:47.459> inch

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
entirely sure yet how maybe eight inch

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:48.830 
entirely sure yet how maybe eight inch
or<00:03:47.940> something<00:03:48.060> like<00:03:48.330> that

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
or something like that

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:50.960 
or something like that
less<00:03:49.230> than<00:03:49.410> that<00:03:49.590> 3/16<00:03:50.310> something<00:03:50.670> like<00:03:50.760> that

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
less than that 3/16 something like that

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:53.420 
less than that 3/16 something like that
okay<00:03:51.959> I'm<00:03:52.050> going<00:03:52.140> to<00:03:52.200> drill<00:03:52.410> bit<00:03:52.560> to<00:03:53.160> sort<00:03:53.340> of

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
okay I'm going to drill bit to sort of

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:54.710 
okay I'm going to drill bit to sort of
drill<00:03:53.640> a<00:03:53.670> bunch<00:03:53.820> of<00:03:53.940> holes<00:03:54.000> in<00:03:54.270> there<00:03:54.450> and<00:03:54.690> uh

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
drill a bunch of holes in there and uh

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.990 
drill a bunch of holes in there and uh
there's<00:03:55.530> some<00:03:55.739> writing<00:03:56.010> on<00:03:56.340> there<00:03:56.610> maybe<00:03:56.850> you

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
there's some writing on there maybe you

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.760 
there's some writing on there maybe you
can<00:03:57.120> see<00:03:57.360> oh<00:03:57.510> there<00:03:57.810> you<00:03:57.900> go<00:03:58.020> you<00:03:58.350> can<00:03:58.410> see<00:03:58.530> the

can see oh there you go you can see the
the<00:04:00.380> penciled<00:04:01.380> circles<00:04:02.370> that<00:04:02.520> I<00:04:02.610> drew<00:04:02.850> on

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
the penciled circles that I drew on

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.520 
the penciled circles that I drew on
there<00:04:03.209> and<00:04:03.360> maybe<00:04:03.570> you<00:04:03.690> can<00:04:03.810> see<00:04:03.989> that<00:04:04.200> the

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530 
there and maybe you can see that the

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:07.010 
there and maybe you can see that the
holes<00:04:05.160> are<00:04:05.430> kind<00:04:05.610> of<00:04:05.670> marked<00:04:05.910> out<00:04:06.060> you<00:04:06.750> can<00:04:06.900> see

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:07.020 
holes are kind of marked out you can see

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:08.840 
holes are kind of marked out you can see
that<00:04:07.170> there's<00:04:07.350> writing<00:04:07.800> up<00:04:08.010> raised<00:04:08.370> writing

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:08.850 
that there's writing up raised writing

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:10.610 
that there's writing up raised writing
on<00:04:08.970> there<00:04:09.150> and<00:04:09.239> you<00:04:09.420> know<00:04:09.540> tell<00:04:10.140> us<00:04:10.170> what<00:04:10.380> kind

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
on there and you know tell us what kind

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:13.040 
on there and you know tell us what kind
of<00:04:11.150> plastic<00:04:12.150> it's<00:04:12.300> made<00:04:12.480> out<00:04:12.630> of<00:04:12.660> and<00:04:12.840> all<00:04:12.900> that

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:13.050 
of plastic it's made out of and all that

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:14.350 
of plastic it's made out of and all that
crap<00:04:13.230> I'm<00:04:13.410> going<00:04:13.530> to<00:04:13.590> sand<00:04:13.800> that<00:04:13.920> down

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:14.360 
crap I'm going to sand that down

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:17.210 
crap I'm going to sand that down
probably<00:04:15.360> by<00:04:15.510> hand<00:04:15.959> and<00:04:16.230> then<00:04:16.859> I<00:04:16.890> think<00:04:17.100> when

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220 
probably by hand and then I think when

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:18.170 
probably by hand and then I think when
it<00:04:17.310> comes<00:04:17.400> together<00:04:17.609> it's<00:04:17.880> going<00:04:17.970> to<00:04:18.060> look

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180 
it comes together it's going to look

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:23.090 
it comes together it's going to look
good<00:04:18.390> so<00:04:18.680> I'm<00:04:19.680> gonna<00:04:19.770> head<00:04:19.980> out<00:04:20.100> to<00:04:20.130> the<00:04:22.100> shed

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:23.100 
good so I'm gonna head out to the shed

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:23.960 
good so I'm gonna head out to the shed
over<00:04:23.400> there<00:04:23.550> and<00:04:23.729> do<00:04:23.820> the

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:23.970 
over there and do the

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:25.910 
over there and do the
drilling<00:04:24.210> not<00:04:24.600> on<00:04:24.750> camera<00:04:25.050> because<00:04:25.380> become

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:25.920 
drilling not on camera because become

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:28.160 
drilling not on camera because become
redundant<00:04:26.460> and<00:04:26.640> then<00:04:27.270> I'll<00:04:27.390> be<00:04:27.540> back<00:04:27.570> and<00:04:28.020> I'll

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:28.170 
redundant and then I'll be back and I'll

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:30.410 
redundant and then I'll be back and I'll
show<00:04:28.200> you<00:04:28.530> how<00:04:29.040> to<00:04:29.070> assemble<00:04:29.430> it<00:04:29.670> and<00:04:29.910> what<00:04:30.360> it

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:30.420 
show you how to assemble it and what it

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:35.540 
show you how to assemble it and what it
looks<00:04:30.510> like<00:04:33.170> okay<00:04:34.170> here<00:04:34.500> we<00:04:34.650> are<00:04:34.680> back<00:04:35.160> from

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:35.550 
looks like okay here we are back from

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:40.250 
looks like okay here we are back from
the<00:04:35.730> garage<00:04:36.560> and<00:04:38.270> as<00:04:39.270> you<00:04:39.420> can<00:04:39.630> see<00:04:39.840> I've<00:04:40.050> got

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:40.260 
the garage and as you can see I've got

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:43.190 
the garage and as you can see I've got
everything<00:04:40.560> drilled<00:04:41.540> see<00:04:42.540> the<00:04:42.690> pattern<00:04:43.080> of

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:43.200 
everything drilled see the pattern of

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:46.160 
everything drilled see the pattern of
the<00:04:43.290> holes<00:04:43.530> and<00:04:44.370> you<00:04:44.550> can<00:04:44.580> see<00:04:45.000> the<00:04:45.330> back<00:04:45.960> of

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:46.170 
the holes and you can see the back of

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:48.800 
the holes and you can see the back of
the<00:04:46.290> shell<00:04:46.560> here<00:04:46.890> with<00:04:47.100> the<00:04:47.220> two<00:04:47.430> holes<00:04:47.810> one

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:48.810 
the shell here with the two holes one

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:51.170 
the shell here with the two holes one
for<00:04:49.230> the<00:04:49.440> guitar<00:04:50.130> jack<00:04:50.430> and<00:04:50.730> one<00:04:50.880> for<00:04:51.150> the

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:51.180 
for the guitar jack and one for the

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:52.930 
for the guitar jack and one for the
volume<00:04:51.540> potentiometer

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:52.940 
volume potentiometer

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:56.600 
volume potentiometer
so<00:04:54.470> before<00:04:55.470> I<00:04:55.500> had<00:04:55.740> to<00:04:55.860> make<00:04:56.010> an<00:04:56.190> elaborate

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:56.610 
so before I had to make an elaborate

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:59.330 
so before I had to make an elaborate
gasket<00:04:57.150> turns<00:04:57.870> out<00:04:58.140> that<00:04:58.500> this<00:04:59.130> particular

00:04:59.330 --> 00:04:59.340 
gasket turns out that this particular

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:01.940 
gasket turns out that this particular
microphone<00:05:00.150> element<00:05:00.330> fits<00:05:00.930> pretty<00:05:01.770> much

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:01.950 
microphone element fits pretty much

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:03.710 
microphone element fits pretty much
perfectly<00:05:02.430> down<00:05:02.670> in<00:05:02.880> there<00:05:03.060> so<00:05:03.300> I<00:05:03.330> added<00:05:03.540> a

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:03.720 
perfectly down in there so I added a

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:06.230 
perfectly down in there so I added a
little<00:05:03.870> bit<00:05:04.050> of<00:05:04.850> electrical<00:05:05.850> tape<00:05:06.030> around

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:06.240 
little bit of electrical tape around

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:09.380 
little bit of electrical tape around
there<00:05:06.750> to<00:05:06.900> make<00:05:07.050> a<00:05:07.080> good<00:05:07.290> seal<00:05:07.620> and<00:05:08.030> if<00:05:09.030> I<00:05:09.180> just

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:09.390 
there to make a good seal and if I just

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:11.960 
there to make a good seal and if I just
sort<00:05:09.600> of<00:05:09.690> stick<00:05:10.020> it<00:05:10.050> in<00:05:10.290> there<00:05:10.560> and<00:05:10.890> get<00:05:11.670> lined

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:11.970 
sort of stick it in there and get lined

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:17.420 
sort of stick it in there and get lined
up<00:05:13.400> and<00:05:14.400> press<00:05:14.700> down<00:05:15.000> that<00:05:15.960> pop<00:05:16.260> you<00:05:17.040> can<00:05:17.220> see

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:17.430 
up and press down that pop you can see

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:19.070 
up and press down that pop you can see
it's<00:05:17.580> stuck<00:05:17.910> in<00:05:18.060> there<00:05:18.240> really<00:05:18.450> well<00:05:18.690> I<00:05:18.750> can't

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:19.080 
it's stuck in there really well I can't

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:24.530 
it's stuck in there really well I can't
even<00:05:19.200> pull<00:05:19.560> it<00:05:19.680> out<00:05:19.830> like<00:05:20.100> that<00:05:20.340> so<00:05:23.330> the<00:05:24.330> rest

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:24.540 
even pull it out like that so the rest

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:28.330 
even pull it out like that so the rest
of<00:05:24.690> the<00:05:24.810> assembly<00:05:25.050> is<00:05:25.380> pretty<00:05:25.440> simple<00:05:26.930> simply

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:28.340 
of the assembly is pretty simple simply

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:33.020 
of the assembly is pretty simple simply

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:10.450 
screw down over the components easy

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:12.810 
screw down over the components easy
access<00:06:11.050> this<00:06:11.290> time<00:06:11.590> since<00:06:11.950> the<00:06:12.220> mic<00:06:12.400> sort<00:06:12.730> of

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:12.820 
access this time since the mic sort of

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:15.540 
access this time since the mic sort of
splits<00:06:13.150> in<00:06:13.330> half<00:06:13.360> towards<00:06:14.110> the<00:06:14.230> back<00:06:14.470> I<00:06:14.830> don't

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:15.550 
splits in half towards the back I don't

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:18.120 
splits in half towards the back I don't
even<00:06:15.640> think<00:06:15.790> I<00:06:16.090> need<00:06:16.150> to<00:06:16.590> without<00:06:17.590> the<00:06:17.650> pliers

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:18.130 
even think I need to without the pliers

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:21.200 
even think I need to without the pliers
on<00:06:18.460> this<00:06:18.640> one<00:06:18.880> so<00:06:19.570> you<00:06:19.720> see<00:06:19.960> the<00:06:20.110> two<00:06:20.320> halves

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:21.210 
on this one so you see the two halves

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:24.390 
on this one so you see the two halves
let<00:06:22.210> me<00:06:22.330> get<00:06:22.540> the<00:06:22.660> light<00:06:22.870> in<00:06:23.050> it<00:06:23.170> there<00:06:23.400> there's

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:24.400 
let me get the light in it there there's

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:29.220 
let me get the light in it there there's
the<00:06:24.610> element<00:06:24.940> half<00:06:25.360> and<00:06:26.080> there<00:06:26.320> is<00:06:26.940> your<00:06:28.230> jack

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:29.230 
the element half and there is your jack

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:33.090 
the element half and there is your jack
and<00:06:29.560> potentiometer<00:06:30.690> assortment<00:06:31.690> you<00:06:32.100> could

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:33.100 
and potentiometer assortment you could

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:34.560 
and potentiometer assortment you could
put<00:06:33.400> it<00:06:33.520> I<00:06:33.580> could<00:06:33.730> have<00:06:33.760> put<00:06:34.030> some<00:06:34.270> cloth

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:34.570 
put it I could have put some cloth

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:37.350 
put it I could have put some cloth
behind<00:06:35.020> us<00:06:35.460> but<00:06:36.460> I<00:06:36.580> really<00:06:36.820> didn't<00:06:37.060> feel<00:06:37.210> like

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:37.360 
behind us but I really didn't feel like

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:39.000 
behind us but I really didn't feel like
doing<00:06:37.600> that<00:06:37.750> and<00:06:38.170> you<00:06:38.410> wouldn't<00:06:38.620> really<00:06:38.740> see

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:39.010 
doing that and you wouldn't really see

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:41.910 
doing that and you wouldn't really see
it<00:06:39.100> through<00:06:39.310> holes<00:06:39.490> that<00:06:39.640> small<00:06:39.940> anyway<00:06:40.890> but<00:06:41.890> a

00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:41.920 
it through holes that small anyway but a

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:43.230 
it through holes that small anyway but a
lot<00:06:42.070> of<00:06:42.100> people<00:06:42.220> do<00:06:42.460> that<00:06:42.580> one<00:06:42.910> to<00:06:43.090> make<00:06:43.210> it

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:43.240 
lot of people do that one to make it

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:43.890 
lot of people do that one to make it
look<00:06:43.480> good

00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:43.900 
look good

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:47.370 
look good
the<00:06:44.380> other<00:06:44.530> thing<00:06:44.710> is<00:06:45.000> sort<00:06:46.000> of<00:06:46.060> softens<00:06:46.630> P&amp;S

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:47.380 
the other thing is sort of softens P&amp;S

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:51.470 
the other thing is sort of softens P&amp;S
sounds<00:06:48.010> and<00:06:48.280> also<00:06:49.620> you<00:06:50.620> know<00:06:50.740> is<00:06:50.920> there<00:06:51.130> to

00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:51.480 
sounds and also you know is there to

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:54.810 
sounds and also you know is there to
separate<00:06:52.480> your<00:06:52.720> spit<00:06:53.530> and<00:06:53.740> moisture<00:06:54.280> and

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:54.820 
separate your spit and moisture and

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:57.930 
separate your spit and moisture and
breath<00:06:55.150> moisture<00:06:55.600> from<00:06:55.870> the<00:06:56.280> element<00:06:57.280> so<00:06:57.910> you

00:06:57.930 --> 00:06:57.940 
breath moisture from the element so you

00:06:57.940 --> 00:06:59.610 
breath moisture from the element so you
can<00:06:58.120> do<00:06:58.210> that<00:06:58.360> if<00:06:58.450> you<00:06:58.570> want<00:06:58.780> I<00:06:59.110> didn't<00:06:59.470> do<00:06:59.590> that

00:06:59.610 --> 00:06:59.620 
can do that if you want I didn't do that

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:02.520 
can do that if you want I didn't do that
here<00:07:00.040> we<00:07:00.700> think<00:07:01.000> go<00:07:01.360> together<00:07:01.540> these<00:07:02.350> two

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:02.530 
here we think go together these two

00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:04.310 
here we think go together these two
halves<00:07:02.740> go<00:07:02.950> together<00:07:03.070> pretty<00:07:03.490> simply

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:04.320 
halves go together pretty simply

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:07.790 
halves go together pretty simply
so<00:07:05.320> curling<00:07:06.160> it<00:07:06.250> up<00:07:06.370> a<00:07:06.490> little<00:07:06.610> bit<00:07:06.850> like<00:07:07.030> that

00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:07.800 
so curling it up a little bit like that

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:10.740 
so curling it up a little bit like that
face<00:07:08.800> down<00:07:09.130> there's<00:07:09.760> a<00:07:09.820> little<00:07:10.240> tab<00:07:10.720> there

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:10.750 
face down there's a little tab there

00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:13.020 
face down there's a little tab there
when<00:07:11.320> I<00:07:11.350> get<00:07:11.560> lined<00:07:11.860> up<00:07:12.070> so<00:07:12.310> does<00:07:12.460> it<00:07:12.610> look<00:07:12.790> at<00:07:13.000> a

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:13.030 
when I get lined up so does it look at a

00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:17.640 
when I get lined up so does it look at a
place<00:07:13.390> and<00:07:14.100> then<00:07:15.100> but<00:07:15.990> it's<00:07:16.990> not<00:07:17.110> a<00:07:17.140> perfect

00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:17.650 
place and then but it's not a perfect

00:07:17.650 --> 00:07:21.540 
place and then but it's not a perfect
fit<00:07:17.890> but<00:07:18.420> it's<00:07:19.420> together<00:07:19.600> pretty<00:07:19.930> good<00:07:20.550> so

00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:21.550 
fit but it's together pretty good so

00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:26.430 
fit but it's together pretty good so
there<00:07:21.790> you<00:07:21.970> go<00:07:22.180> and<00:07:22.510> assembled<00:07:23.760> mic<00:07:25.260> you<00:07:26.260> can

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:26.440 
there you go and assembled mic you can

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:30.020 
there you go and assembled mic you can
put<00:07:26.680> any<00:07:27.160> kind<00:07:27.430> of<00:07:28.020> knobby<00:07:29.020> one<00:07:29.170> on<00:07:29.320> there<00:07:29.590> and

00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:30.030 
put any kind of knobby one on there and

00:07:30.030 --> 00:07:32.690 
put any kind of knobby one on there and
just<00:07:31.030> hang<00:07:31.480> on<00:07:31.540> a<00:07:31.600> second<00:07:31.930> on<00:07:32.020> the<00:07:32.140> grabba

00:07:32.690 --> 00:07:32.700 
just hang on a second on the grabba

00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:36.749 
just hang on a second on the grabba
gonna<00:07:33.700> grab<00:07:33.910> a<00:07:33.940> jack

00:07:36.749 --> 00:07:36.759 

00:07:36.759 --> 00:07:42.040 

so<00:07:37.759> the<00:07:37.820> table<00:07:38.120> side<00:07:38.990> Pompton<00:07:40.720> this<00:07:41.720> is<00:07:41.870> what

00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:42.050 
so the table side Pompton this is what

00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:44.439 
so the table side Pompton this is what
it<00:07:42.169> looks<00:07:42.350> like<00:07:42.560> when<00:07:43.160> it's<00:07:43.340> attached<00:07:43.910> to<00:07:44.300> a

00:07:44.439 --> 00:07:44.449 
it looks like when it's attached to a

00:07:44.449 --> 00:07:48.520 
it looks like when it's attached to a
cable<00:07:45.759> alright<00:07:46.759> that's<00:07:47.240> it<00:07:47.419> I<00:07:47.720> hope<00:07:48.169> you<00:07:48.380> found

00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:48.530 
cable alright that's it I hope you found

00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:54.250 
cable alright that's it I hope you found
that<00:07:49.000> instructable<00:07:50.770> catch<00:07:51.770> on<00:07:51.949> the<00:07:52.039> flip<00:07:52.220> side
