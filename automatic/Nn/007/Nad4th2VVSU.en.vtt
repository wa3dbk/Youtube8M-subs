00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 greetings hammered for all to the titan 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.779
 hammer and I bring you we have called damage 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:09.210
 indicators which if you do not know 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:11.580
 you're still going to love it since the 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.040
 time to aim at the goals we will 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.230
 show the life bar is going to show you 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.390
 also the damage to inflict on said 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.240
 objective and also the life that remains 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.519
 The most interesting thing in this way is that 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.640
 It is a client mod as it happens with 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:28.800
 optics in minimal res or take items and with 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.050
 have you installed in your 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.320
 client, you will be able to use it both in 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.970
 way a player like in multiplayer 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:38.940
 we think here 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:41.510
 way a player in the cottage that believes 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:45.230
 for the previous mode 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:46.760
 here I am waving and good first 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:48.739
 I'll show you what the mod consists of 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:52.250
 and then I'll show you the installation 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:54.800
 in this case by pressing the dot button 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:56.359
 on the keyboard would take us to this menu 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.089
 in which in the upper corner 

00:00:56.359 --> 00:01:02.059
 left we see a series of bars with 

00:00:59.089 --> 00:01:05.180
 the name life the drawing with the 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:07.580
 character and an icon this icon changes 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:11.630
 according to the objective that we have pointing 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:15.170
 in case of being a player it would be a helmet 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:17.420
 in case of being an enemy a mobile would be 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:19.520
 a skeleton and in case of being an animal 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:22.550
 it would be a chance for that I'll see more 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:25.330
 ahead as you see here we can put 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:27.710
 to enable and disable the portrait 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:30.200
 we can also put to enable and 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:32.990
 must avoid seeing the effect of the 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:37.630
 potions we can change also the 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:37.630
 scale if we want to see it bigger 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:42.910
 or smaller I prefer to have a little 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:45.040
 more tiny we can also change 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:47.610
 the color in which the damage that 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:49.780
 we inflict and also the life bar 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:52.210
 right now they 're green and they're in 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:56.729
 red and we can also select a 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:56.729
 skin and we can change the design 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.210
 this is world of warcraft style to the 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:06.150
 that you have played eggs are now much 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:09.179
 and this is a little bit more compact 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:12.739
 I'm going to leave for example this same 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.739
 we close here with the X 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:18.760
 and as you all know from the last 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:21.760
 update on the weapons the sword of 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:24.550
 wood inflicts more than 4 damage the sword 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:26.950
 of diamond and inflicts more 7 we go to 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:29.319
 look for an animal around here look here 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:33.489
 we have a pig as you can see when 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:35.860
 we aim appears the bar has 10 of 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:38.470
 life also appears the icon of the 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:41.769
 claw as I indicated and if we hit 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:45.599
 for example with the wooden sword you see 

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:45.599
 how low you have done 5 damage 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:52.590
 you're running, we're going to hit it and there 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:54.859
 see as seen with good red letters 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:58.319
 with red numbers the damage we inflicted 

00:02:54.859 --> 00:03:00.520
 53 and we killed him because the sheep only 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:03.520
 I had 8 life 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:04.930
 here we have another pig in this case 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:06.460
 As you can see, the pig does not have life 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:08.650
 Whole will have fallen will be done 

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:11.620
 damage if we hit him with the sword 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:14.350
 diamond we have done 8 damage of a 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:17.140
 just hit and we have killed him in the case 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:22.010
 of the zombies if you look at the icon 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:24.230
 a red skull comes out to be an enemy 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:27.920
 and I'm going to show you the effect of 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:30.939
 damage in time here is the zombie that 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.939
 I'm going to catch fire 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:37.630
 and we're going to set the zombie on fire for 

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:40.710
 that you see how it is hurt by seconds 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:46.280
 1111 

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:46.280
 and there ends up dying we are the fire 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:50.290
 let's see if we find someone else 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:54.599
 it was a crime 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:03.170
 there the clipper is dying 

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:10.910
 and there he is dead 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:17.400
 and now I'm going to show you how it works 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:20.570
 also the multiplayer mode 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:23.230
 we leave it here we give it out 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:26.650
 we have here the multiplayer mode 

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:26.650
 we enter the server 

00:04:32.009 --> 00:04:36.229
 we are here in the square look and there is a 

00:04:33.749 --> 00:04:36.229
 player 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:43.229
 and when we point to users as 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:43.229
 you see 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:48.930
 shows us the name shows us the 

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:51.480
 life that they have and also shows us the 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:54.300
 icon s for example all covered in 

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:57.190
 arrows if you look at the icon is a 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:59.490
 green helmet 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:01.700
 Being also 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:03.860
 a player 

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:06.350
 and good finally I'll show you how 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:07.889
 the installation is done we would give it here 

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:09.990
 to leave 

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:13.439
 I recommend you do the installation of 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:16.560
 optimal comfort if with mods that now the 

00:05:13.439 --> 00:05:18.479
 Fort 789 is compatible with 4 optics 

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:21.509
 you have all the steps that you have to 

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:23.039
 follow in the video and have no loss of 

00:05:21.509 --> 00:05:26.099
 Anyway I'll teach you how 

00:05:23.039 --> 00:05:30.300
 would install from scratch we would go here to 

00:05:26.099 --> 00:05:32.310
 percentage to property to percentage 

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:34.470
 we would go to the mini dot folder 

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:36.289
 Kraft we obliterate I will 

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:39.479
 change the name to not lose it 

00:05:36.289 --> 00:05:41.800
 it is also possible that you had the 

00:05:39.479 --> 00:05:44.650
 minecraft folder here 

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:45.460
 between 2 user points the name of 

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:47.819
 user 

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:47.819
 Minecraft 

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:51.580
 and then we would go here 

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:57.460
 we will run the launcher to install 

00:05:55.009 --> 00:05:57.460
 Minecraft 

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:02.770
 once it is finished installing 

00:05:59.449 --> 00:06:02.770
 we run the game 

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:11.919
 Once opened, we close them and 

00:06:09.129 --> 00:06:15.090
 we proceed to install fort we extract the 

00:06:11.919 --> 00:06:15.090
 file point jar here 

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:21.860
 we give you right click to see with java 

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:24.439
 platform 

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:25.939
 We give you install client in case of 

00:06:24.439 --> 00:06:28.009
 that this is not the installation route 

00:06:25.939 --> 00:06:30.139
 we would modify it by giving it to this 

00:06:28.009 --> 00:06:32.330
 button as I already told you could also 

00:06:30.139 --> 00:06:35.639
 be users user names in this 

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:38.490
 case I have hummer and minecraft 

00:06:35.639 --> 00:06:41.479
 I'm going to accept my line, we'll go back to 

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:41.479
 run the game 

00:06:43.449 --> 00:06:47.430
 we select the profile de force 

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:52.090
 we execute minecraft 

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:56.810
 and we wait for the installation 

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:56.810
 necessary 

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:07.540
 we close it once more we go here 

00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:10.570
 again to the app data folder 

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:12.900
 Percentages pp data percentage point 

00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:18.240
 minecraft the folder mods 

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:21.389
 we go inside and copy the file 

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:23.129
 damage indicators we close here we go back 

00:07:21.389 --> 00:07:25.409
 to run minecraft 

00:07:23.129 --> 00:07:26.789
 and now I should leave the installed on 

00:07:25.409 --> 00:07:29.929
 mode 

00:07:26.789 --> 00:07:29.929
 we execute the minecraft 

00:07:32.969 --> 00:07:38.219
 as you see here in many here is so 

00:07:35.579 --> 00:07:40.889
 male indicators with which you are not going to 

00:07:38.219 --> 00:07:42.629
 have any kind of problem and nothing 

00:07:40.889 --> 00:07:45.389
 I hope you liked it and that it served 

00:07:42.629 --> 00:07:47.039
 of help that you enjoy giving it to the 

00:07:45.389 --> 00:07:49.279
