00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:11.340
 the same day 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.730
 we were sticking out of the mill 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:17.080
 solar 

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:19.480
 and my brother is intimate with noise and asia 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:21.000
 and my brother after feeling a noise from a 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:24.119
 plane but 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.350
 I do not see it every time it's coming 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:30.850
 more to us 

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:33.340
 the takeoff was a little bit off 

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:38.370
 normal because the clouds we had 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:38.370
 in the middle of the track and at the bottom 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:49.760
 when the plane already had about 2600 feet 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:53.960
 of height is when you heard a very loud noise 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:55.780
 strong and a wobble of the plane towards a 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:58.070
 side 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:00.710
 I do not care for you 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:02.870
 and then I asked the stewardess that 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:05.630
 I was going to eat right away they called her from the 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:07.520
 head I teach you I said to his wife the 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:11.170
 look at this bug goes wrong 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.170
 this bug goes wrong and left 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.640
 in all the years that I was in aviation 

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:23.920
 at the first time and the only time that I 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:27.970
 I saw once 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:29.680
 this was a piece of metal that badly 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:32.070
 it stays in the air and goes to water 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:34.979
 little nervous 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:37.500
 but it was all very fast did not give time 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:39.510
 to think a lot 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.740
 today I had the bad couple here fast 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:43.170
 come on, father 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.800
 let's see how the engine starts and 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.800
 when 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:50.850
 the blow at sea ​​that's why it was a bomb 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:57.609
 that 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.609
 has never left the head 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.649
 i 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:26.820
 then they agreed that the 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.820
 situation was not going to be difficult 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.400
 Y
