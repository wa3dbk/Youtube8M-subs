00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.370
 the homemade tomato sauce 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:14.549
 You will need tomato onion radio 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:18.680
 cut tomatoes in half or 4 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.680
 sautÃ© with a little olive oil 

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:27.750
 put the onion and garlic cut 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.760
 they do not have to be very 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:34.200
 small can be great even because 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:37.020
 then you will crush mix well and 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:42.480
 leave capped until it stays until it 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:44.850
 begin to fall apart from time to 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:51.059
 So long it moves and always so much 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:53.579
 panela I call an opening it goes 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:56.219
 Going back quite a bit when it gets more 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.699
 or less at this point you can go through 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.699
 mixer 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.200
 down the fire for those who do not respond 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:11.130
 leave in the pan for a while 

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:13.690
 he will reduce the low fire 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:19.390
 then you have two options 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:21.370
 you can with the water and if you 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:24.370
 place the sauce back in the pan to 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:28.240
 that it reduces more, otherwise it gets much 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:30.850
 very thin liquid 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:33.960
 I do not run I put it all myself 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:33.960
 it's that way 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:40.240
 then simply place containers and 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:42.460
 put in either the freezer or the refrigerator 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.860
 I like to make enough I go 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:47.400
 I use for a week I do not need 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:47.400
 Freeze
