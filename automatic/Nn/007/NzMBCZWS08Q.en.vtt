00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:19.580 
better when it's more balanced but the

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:23.410 
better when it's more balanced but the
point<00:04:19.850> is<00:04:20.060> that<00:04:20.630> ultimately<00:04:21.520> no<00:04:22.520> human<00:04:23.090> being

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:55.310 
they want it dealt and and I've just

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:57.610 
they want it dealt and and I've just
heard<00:04:55.670> eight<00:04:56.000> million<00:04:56.540> of<00:04:56.720> them<00:04:56.870> say<00:04:57.140> but<00:04:57.500> you

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:57.620 
heard eight million of them say but you

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:59.410 
heard eight million of them say but you
know<00:04:57.770> and<00:04:58.040> I<00:04:58.130> really<00:04:58.430> do<00:04:58.640> like<00:04:58.940> it<00:04:59.180> that<00:04:59.330> he

00:04:59.410 --> 00:04:59.420 
know and I really do like it that he

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:01.870 
know and I really do like it that he
doesn't<00:04:59.720> let<00:04:59.810> me<00:04:59.870> get<00:05:00.080> away<00:05:00.140> with<00:05:00.560> it<00:05:00.730> and<00:05:01.730> they

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:01.880 
doesn't let me get away with it and they

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:04.480 
doesn't let me get away with it and they
say<00:05:02.060> that<00:05:02.240> over<00:05:02.450> and<00:05:02.510> over<00:05:02.630> so<00:05:03.290> they<00:05:04.160> want<00:05:04.460> to

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:04.490 
say that over and over so they want to

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:06.630 
say that over and over so they want to
be<00:05:04.730> led<00:05:05.390> but<00:05:05.870> they<00:05:05.990> don't<00:05:06.200> want<00:05:06.350> to<00:05:06.410> be

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:06.640 
be led but they don't want to be

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:09.910 
be led but they don't want to be
dominated<00:05:07.640> okay<00:05:08.210> so<00:05:08.660> that's<00:05:09.380> what<00:05:09.590> I<00:05:09.620> mean<00:05:09.860> by

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:09.920 
dominated okay so that's what I mean by

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:12.370 
dominated okay so that's what I mean by
what<00:05:10.610> we<00:05:10.730> call<00:05:10.910> real<00:05:11.180> relational<00:05:11.840> power<00:05:12.050> it's

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:12.380 
what we call real relational power it's

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:15.010 
what we call real relational power it's
not<00:05:12.470> domination<00:05:13.310> it's<00:05:13.490> not<00:05:13.640> control<00:05:14.150> but

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:15.020 
not domination it's not control but

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:17.830 
not domination it's not control but
you're<00:05:15.320> showing<00:05:15.620> up<00:05:16.010> with<00:05:16.400> some<00:05:16.430> sort<00:05:16.970> of<00:05:17.090> a

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:17.840 
you're showing up with some sort of a

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:20.230 
you're showing up with some sort of a
way<00:05:18.050> that<00:05:18.320> they<00:05:18.470> feel<00:05:18.710> feel<00:05:19.370> cared<00:05:19.730> about<00:05:19.850> and

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:20.240 
way that they feel feel cared about and

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:23.230 
way that they feel feel cared about and
then<00:05:20.840> you<00:05:21.110> won't<00:05:21.260> need<00:05:21.470> the<00:05:21.650> Ferrari<00:05:22.240> okay

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:23.240 
then you won't need the Ferrari okay

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:26.530 
then you won't need the Ferrari okay
because<00:05:23.720> what<00:05:24.020> we<00:05:24.140> see<00:05:24.350> is<00:05:24.650> is<00:05:25.100> the<00:05:25.850> just<00:05:26.060> the

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:26.540 
because what we see is is the just the

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:29.310 
because what we see is is the just the
symbols<00:05:27.530> of<00:05:27.650> power<00:05:27.860> go<00:05:28.160> away<00:05:28.460> and<00:05:28.730> basically

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:29.320 
symbols of power go away and basically

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:31.510 
symbols of power go away and basically
what<00:05:30.320> they're<00:05:30.470> looking<00:05:30.860> for

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:31.520 
what they're looking for

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:33.040 
what they're looking for

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:16.610 
try to turn them into a child and what

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:20.170 
try to turn them into a child and what
we<00:06:16.729> find<00:06:17.000> is<00:06:17.419> that<00:06:17.919> when<00:06:18.919> when<00:06:19.490> men<00:06:19.849> have

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:20.180 
we find is that when when men have

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:22.719 
we find is that when when men have
relational<00:06:21.020> power<00:06:21.319> the<00:06:21.680> power<00:06:21.949> to<00:06:22.280> connect

00:06:22.719 --> 00:06:22.729 
relational power the power to connect

00:06:22.729 --> 00:06:25.779 
relational power the power to connect
the<00:06:23.180> power<00:06:23.419> to<00:06:23.690> be<00:06:23.810> present<00:06:24.349> the<00:06:25.099> power<00:06:25.400> to<00:06:25.639> be

00:06:25.779 --> 00:06:25.789 
the power to be present the power to be

00:06:25.789 --> 00:06:28.350 
the power to be present the power to be
uncollected<00:06:26.719> about<00:06:27.020> their<00:06:27.229> desires<00:06:27.770> and

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:28.360 
uncollected about their desires and

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:33.010 
uncollected about their desires and
pursue<00:06:29.360> them<00:06:30.699> that<00:06:31.699> a<00:06:31.729> lot<00:06:32.270> of<00:06:32.419> things<00:06:32.659> begin

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:33.020 
pursue them that a lot of things begin

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:34.990 
pursue them that a lot of things begin
to<00:06:33.050> happen<00:06:33.199> and<00:06:33.770> it's<00:06:34.069> really<00:06:34.340> amazing<00:06:34.669> I've

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:35.000 
to happen and it's really amazing I've

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.140 
to happen and it's really amazing I've
seen<00:06:35.240> so<00:06:35.870> many<00:06:36.169> relationships<00:06:36.800> even<00:06:37.400> even<00:06:38.030> in

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:38.150 
seen so many relationships even even in

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:41.260 
seen so many relationships even even in
marriages<00:06:38.659> that<00:06:39.139> they<00:06:39.650> go<00:06:39.860> bad<00:06:40.099> and<00:06:40.460> you<00:06:41.120> know

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:41.270 
marriages that they go bad and you know

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:42.790 
marriages that they go bad and you know
everything's<00:06:41.719> about<00:06:41.930> to<00:06:42.110> split<00:06:42.409> apart<00:06:42.650> in

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:42.800 
everything's about to split apart in

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:46.379 
everything's about to split apart in
this<00:06:42.889> end<00:06:43.130> the<00:06:43.219> other<00:06:43.310> and<00:06:44.319> when<00:06:45.319> you<00:06:45.349> begin<00:06:45.650> to

00:06:46.379 --> 00:06:46.389 
this end the other and when you begin to

00:06:46.389 --> 00:06:50.439 
this end the other and when you begin to
get<00:06:47.389> to<00:06:47.599> these<00:06:47.810> dynamics<00:06:48.880> especially<00:06:49.880> of<00:06:50.330> the

00:06:50.439 --> 00:06:50.449 
get to these dynamics especially of the

00:06:50.449 --> 00:06:52.779 
get to these dynamics especially of the
men<00:06:50.659> that<00:06:50.960> have<00:06:51.110> sort<00:06:51.380> of<00:06:51.500> you<00:06:51.860> know<00:06:51.889> had<00:06:52.669> the

00:06:52.779 --> 00:06:52.789 
men that have sort of you know had the

00:06:52.789 --> 00:06:54.519 
men that have sort of you know had the
things<00:06:53.000> we're<00:06:53.180> talking<00:06:53.330> about<00:06:53.599> and<00:06:53.870> you<00:06:54.229> begin

00:06:54.519 --> 00:06:54.529 
things we're talking about and you begin

00:06:54.529 --> 00:06:57.820
