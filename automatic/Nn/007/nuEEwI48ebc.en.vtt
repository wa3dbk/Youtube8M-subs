00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
it's kind of weird when I was making

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.219 
it's kind of weird when I was making
this<00:01:06.030> game<00:01:06.270> like<00:01:06.570> there<00:01:06.930> was<00:01:07.020> a<00:01:07.049> way<00:01:07.200> to

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
this game like there was a way to
