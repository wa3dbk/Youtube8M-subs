 hi again youtube people in this 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.790
 video we will see how to patch windows 8.1 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.790
 to install third-party themes 

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:10.790
 we start 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:26.270
 we click right and extract here 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.270
 to install the patch that we will use 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.860
 we enter the folder and execute the 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.860
 installer 

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:41.760
 we give in install 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:08.250
 once the patch is installed we will try 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:10.560
 that works with a theme that I have here 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.580
 I guess you all know how 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:17.420
 install the themes in windows 8.1 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:20.950
 we enter the theme folder 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:20.950
 we copy the files 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:31.270
 we went to local disk of 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:35.579
 we enter the windows folder 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:35.579
 we look for the folder that says re source 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:41.430
 we enter the folder that says themes and 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:41.430
 we paste the theme here 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.579
 we right click on the desktop and 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:59.479
 we went into customize we selected 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:59.479
 the installed theme 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:05.979
 good friends as you can see was installed 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:05.979
 the issue without problems 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:23.110
 this theme is not very personalized by 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:25.400
 what we will not appreciate much the change 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.860
 but here I have another topic 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:31.420
 customized where you can see better 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:31.420
 how the appearance changes 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:38.280
 good friends this was all for this 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:40.760

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:45.260

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:45.260
