00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:04.650
 well found in the kitchen of 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.020
 wonders of my personal trainer tv 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.030
 today we will prepare a second together 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.950
 tasty dish from alternative that yes 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:14.219
 can very well turn into one too 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:16.830
 snack so not elegant appetizer e 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:19.289
 tasty I'm talking about the anchovies a 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:22.920
 beccafico it is a revisitation 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:25.019
 of the classic Sardinian beccafico a 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.420
 typical dish of culinary tradition 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.880
 Sicilian Palermo precisely that 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.250
 provides for the rolling of the anchovies after 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.020
 having filled them full bread the whole 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.430
 grated raisins and pine nuts 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.700
 let's see together what the 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:41.820
 ingredients for preparing anchovies and 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:44.700
 beccafico are clearly needed 12 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:49.140
 anchovies already clean therefore deprived of 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:52.469
 then bind again 20 grams of pine nuts 20 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:55.079
 grams of sultan polluted 78 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.739
 laurel leaves 50 grams of bread 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.670
 grated 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:03.300
 then again 5 grams of cane sugar 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:06.299
 pepper salt a sprig of parsley 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.619
 fresh 20 milliliters of oil 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:10.320
 extra virgin olive oil then two 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.479
 spoons then an untreated orange 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.280
 then we will use rind and a lemon 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:17.090
 Untreated where besides the rind 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.470
 grated we will also use the juice 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:22.140
 let's see how they prepare for 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.330
 alice beccafico as you see I already have 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.970
 chopped parsley and I am 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:29.400
 also preparing sultanas 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:33.299
 but first I put a little to boil 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:35.659
 of water so that the raisins can 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:37.070
 soften well and leave it here 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:40.140
 some minutes 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:42.540
 in the meantime I put on fire a 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:45.600
 pan where we're going to toast the 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.020
 breadcrumbs that are about 50 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.210
 grams 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.460
 together we can put pine nuts 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.619
 both will then be brought into 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.990
 you must not do this little pot 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:58.380
 in other words, to raise the flame a 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:01.020
 little bit and let it all inside 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.659
 without adding oil to some 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:06.210
 minutes so that the toast then i 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:07.700
 pine nuts emanate their perfectly 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:11.490
 flavor 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:13.560
 after a few minutes the bread mixture 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:15.540
 grated and pine nuts it cost then 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.160
 we have moved into one 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.570
 little bowl and now we can go to 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:22.130
 then add the other ingredients 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:30.840
 the chopped parsley 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:33.620
 then salt a little pepper some texts 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:36.959
 they also recommend adding some 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:38.910
 saffron or even marsala 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:42.660
 I, however, do not particularly love 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:46.350
 this contrast so avoid then 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:49.590
 within this we put two 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:54.420
 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:58.140
 of 20 mm 2 tablespoons are are 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:03:02.690
 enough then what we have to do 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:05.580
 we have to go grate a little 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:09.150
 The last I highly recommend Orange 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:11.340
 avoid grating too much and 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:14.750
 also remove the white part 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.750
 of orange because of marostica 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:25.220
 ok the same as the lemon where, however, of the 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:25.220
 lemon we will also use some sauce 

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:33.470
 so this I'm preparing for will be the 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:33.470
 stuffing of anchovies with beccafico 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:50.040
 ok so it may be enough now we take 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:50.040
 however, it is a little lemon and we spur it on 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:56.440
 perfectly then the lemon juice 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:04:02.950
 of lemon is used to reduce the quantity 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:07.019
 of oil needed very well and now not 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:09.550
 we just have to go and drain the raisins 

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:12.790
 which meanwhile is perfectly has 

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:16.959
 let's add that this is the 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:19.480
 compound the brown sugar will serve us 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:22.150
 in the end and then I'll show you a little 

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:25.210
 how to use and now mix up 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:26.740
 to get a compound all well 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:28.780
 amalgamated 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:31.870
 this therefore the filling for ours 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:34.600
 friends as you see here instead I already have 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:37.180
 prepared anchovies and or davis private 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:39.460
 that I took my head off and now I'm not there 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:41.830
 farcirle remains that I have put 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:44.020
 gloves because you can take them with 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:47.919
 stuffed hands then make a bundle 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:51.550
 as i'm doing towards you put stand 

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:56.270
 Alice in the woman by the head e 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:59.280
 then start rolling it up like this 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:01.530
 and proceed in this way with all the 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:04.680
 others then these curls what will happen 

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:06.780
 you ask me will we put it in one 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:09.090
 glass dish I have already prepared 

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:10.980
 sticks because we will make skewers 

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:12.390
 in this way we avoid that these are 

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:14.700
 open during cooking 

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:16.770
 as you can see here I have already prepared 

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:19.950
 also an orange because we will have to 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:21.930
 decorate the pop skewers with orange 

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:24.180
 interspersing orange and leaflets of 

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:27.330
 laurel that their is an ingredient 

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:29.700
 therefore characteristic for this recipe 

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:32.030
 we proceed in this way with all the 

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:32.030
 rizzi 

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:36.840
 at this point we have already started the 

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:37.770
 our alice and now we just have to do 

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:43.860
 the skewers 

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:50.670
 then I recommend first orange then 

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:52.920
 then have the lice then take the 

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:56.520
 lice so that it has its tail turned 

00:05:52.920 --> 00:06:01.310
 upwards like this and then senseless 

00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:03.870
 as a snack and then again orange 

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:05.990
 then you can also just put one 

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:08.790
 laurel leaves or you can too 

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:10.290
 split it into half the leaflet as more 

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:17.190
 you like it 

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:19.470
 and then again alice terminate with 

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:22.080
 the orange so if I also like the 

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:25.080
 lemon you can replace a slice of 

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:26.460
 throw with lemon and then in short yes 

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:27.290
 will proceed in this way with all 

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:30.360
 skewers 

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:32.010
 take the baking dish and fill it 

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:37.410
 you absolutely don't need to do it 

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:40.260
 throw a goal that you put below here 

00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:42.480
 make the base for this dish 

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:44.750
 that sugar was supplied and rab was 

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:47.610
 it was later on the skewers 

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:50.570
 so here we go on this 

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:50.570
 way until it runs out 

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:56.000
 the skewers of anchovies with fig tree are 

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:58.910
 so get ready 

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:02.030
 but now we just have to dust them 

00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:04.070
 with the filling that is left in it 

00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:08.930
 this way i always kept i 

00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:11.050
 gloves and finishing touch sugar of 

00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:11.050
 cane 

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:16.040
 you will see the sugar in the oven 

00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:17.830
 caramel and a contrast that will be 

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:22.669
 really fantastic 

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:26.530
 ok and now let's go in the oven for 180 degrees 

00:07:22.669 --> 00:07:26.530
 for about 20 25 minutes 

00:07:27.889 --> 00:07:32.900
 here are our dialysis spies a 

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:35.000
 beccafico are therefore ready but I have 

00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:37.220
 said the origins of this curious name 

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:39.800
 you must know that the term beccafico 

00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:41.930
 it was used in the past to indicate 

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:43.970
 a little bird that was captured e 

00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:47.000
 locked up in a cage or greased with 

00:07:43.970 --> 00:07:49.370
 the best for then to be cooked at 

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:51.050
 oven and anchovies and beccafico are 

00:07:49.370 --> 00:07:53.780
 you call it that way because 

00:07:51.050 --> 00:07:55.940
 their curious shape resembles that of the 

00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:58.070
 beak of this bizarre little bird 

00:07:55.940 --> 00:07:59.660
 so now all I have to do is greet e 

00:07:58.070 --> 00:08:02.710
 I recommend not allowing it to fill 

00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:02.710
 set highlighted
