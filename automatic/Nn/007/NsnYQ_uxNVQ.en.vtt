00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:08.350
 hello friends of the pissed off point we are of 

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:12.070
 new here and today I will show you how 

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:15.670
 make a natalia in three gradations 

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:18.939
 of color to make this the slightest 

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:21.779
 will serve gump est flower paste in 

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:21.779
 three different colors 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:32.519
 with brush 3 flower chair of different 

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:35.489
 fat size flower tablet 

00:00:32.519 --> 00:00:41.680
 cornstarch or icing sugar 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:45.100
 rolling pin tweezer cutter a cutter 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:46.930
 round is a small piece of parchment paper and 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:49.299
 to finish as I always say yours 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:51.430
 hands we take a small piece of pasta 

00:00:49.299 --> 00:00:56.920
 of the darkest color 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:01:00.430
 we enlarge not very thin because 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:06.810
 will be all the base that will support the 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:11.110
 dahlia just enough 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:16.810
 here it is, we put it on paper 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:18.270
 oven and we support it here now 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:21.190
 let's start with the petals 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:25.200
 we start from the outside inwards 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:25.200
 so we will use the lightest pasta 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.740
 always a little fat vegetable fat 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:34.510
 as I told you crisco ma and burro 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:36.909
 because the butter turns yellow and then it is 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:40.090
 too much is a fat too heavy for 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:42.520
 these pastas instead with this smooth one 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:44.980
 net is the pasta the soft net e 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:47.940
 above all it does not stick to the hands 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:53.800
 and to the tablet 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:56.070
 we spread this in the pair thickness 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.070
 millimeters 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:02.530
 and let's see if we can do this 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:05.560
 a little 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:08.729
 I think so our petals 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:13.270
 starting from this bigger we will do it 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:18.460
 about 15 if they were not enough 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:20.650
 then we'll start over once 

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:23.170
 finished the fifteen pedals of the tour 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:28.930
 outside we'll put some glue on 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:33.610
 on the external base of the base on the 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:36.010
 which we will support will have this work 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:38.110
 we take the petal we tighten it to the 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:40.530
 base creating this nearby and it 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:40.530
 we support 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:52.110
 we repeat the same job 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:52.110
 we will do this for the whole perimeter 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:57.610
 of the base 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:03:04.120
 the finished work will now look like this 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:10.080
 let's move on to a darker shade and 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:10.080
 we will prepare 12 petals 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:14.160
 we always live with a little fat 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:28.239
 we spread this is a cute flower from 

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:31.390
 put on a cupcake as a center on 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:32.920
 a cake for a perimeter of a cake 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:36.010
 clearly it's nice because yes 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:39.000
 can do various sizes per second 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:42.730
 of the flowers turn into the largest petals 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:45.819
 it will be the flower 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:49.930
 let's move on to the more average character e 

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:52.060
 we cut 10 petals 10 12 better always 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:56.430
 have some more than someone in 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:56.430
 less than work 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:02.190
 we always keep the petals covered one 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:04.720
 once we've all done them 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:06.700
 we consider covered 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:08.470
 otherwise they get dry we take them and 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:13.690
 as we did before a dot of 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:15.099
 we tighten it benefit us the 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:18.549
 I work this way 

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:20.500
 here we take our flower 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:24.910
 we give the glue as we did 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:28.830
 previously and we place between the two 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:28.830
 Petals the petal of the next round 

00:04:33.089 --> 00:04:41.349
 between one petal and another must be 

00:04:36.369 --> 00:04:46.719
 practically centered 

00:04:41.349 --> 00:04:52.389
 here it is this way I do it 

00:04:46.719 --> 00:04:57.189
 to see with the other still a petal 

00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:59.379
 bit of glue on the tip we tighten and between 

00:04:57.189 --> 00:05:01.830
 the two petals position another 

00:04:59.379 --> 00:05:01.830
 petal
