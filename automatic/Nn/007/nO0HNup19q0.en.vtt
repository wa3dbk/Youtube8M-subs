00:05:04.159 --> 00:05:06.520 
shade not much the good thing about this
route<00:05:04.400> it<00:05:04.639> is<00:05:04.849> flat<00:05:05.240> as<00:05:05.419> a<00:05:05.449> pancake<00:05:05.659> there<00:05:06.379> are

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:06.530 
route it is flat as a pancake there are

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:10.719 
route it is flat as a pancake there are
no<00:05:06.770> hills<00:05:07.960> the<00:05:08.960> only<00:05:09.229> incline<00:05:10.129> you'll<00:05:10.370> notice

00:05:10.719 --> 00:05:10.729 
no hills the only incline you'll notice

the<00:05:10.969> roads<00:05:11.210> can<00:05:11.659> be<00:05:12.550> kind<00:05:13.550> of<00:05:13.610> crowned<00:05:13.939> so<00:05:14.539> if

00:05:14.769 --> 00:05:14.779 
the roads can be kind of crowned so if

00:05:14.779 --> 00:05:16.209 
the roads can be kind of crowned so if
you<00:05:14.930> can<00:05:15.110> get<00:05:15.289> towards<00:05:15.650> the<00:05:15.710> middle<00:05:15.919> where

00:05:16.209 --> 00:05:16.219 
you can get towards the middle where

00:05:16.219 --> 00:05:18.850 
you can get towards the middle where
it's<00:05:16.340> not<00:05:16.490> quite<00:05:16.819> as<00:05:16.969> steeply<00:05:17.240> sloped<00:05:17.860> right

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:18.860 
it's not quite as steeply sloped right

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:21.249 
it's not quite as steeply sloped right
now<00:05:18.979> we<00:05:19.039> just<00:05:19.219> hit<00:05:19.370> four<00:05:19.729> miles<00:05:20.060> exactly<00:05:20.930> we're

will<00:05:29.779> be<00:05:29.870> a<00:05:29.900> turnaround<00:05:30.319> point<00:05:30.800> and<00:05:31.099> we're

00:05:31.779 --> 00:05:31.789 
will be a turnaround point and we're

00:05:31.789 --> 00:05:34.499 
will be a turnaround point and we're
going<00:05:31.999> back<00:05:32.210> up<00:05:32.240> for<00:05:32.659> all<00:05:32.719> street<00:05:33.199> headed<00:05:33.620> west

00:06:59.110 --> 00:06:59.120 
strip joints on the right I don't think

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:02.270

00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:09.890 
can see my concern about trains because
you<00:07:07.889> cross<00:07:08.100> this<00:07:08.340> track<00:07:08.670> probably<00:07:09.300> four<00:07:09.570> times
