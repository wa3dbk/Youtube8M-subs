Norfolk and it wasn't alright it wasn't

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:22.670 
Norfolk and it wasn't alright it wasn't
alright<00:00:21.270> condition<00:00:21.750> everything<00:00:22.230> was<00:00:22.500> working

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
alright condition everything was working

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.460 
alright condition everything was working
right<00:00:23.010> the<00:00:23.880> holes<00:00:24.090> in<00:00:24.300> good<00:00:24.420> condition<00:00:26.060> but<00:00:27.060> a

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:27.470

couple year to ago

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.179 
couple year to ago
I<00:00:30.109> decided<00:00:31.109> it<00:00:31.260> was<00:00:31.349> time<00:00:31.529> to<00:00:31.710> be<00:00:31.830> redone

I decided it was time to be redone

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.520 
I decided it was time to be redone
because<00:00:32.579> the<00:00:32.759> paint<00:00:33.000> was<00:00:33.120> chipping<00:00:33.390> it<00:00:34.350> was

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
because the paint was chipping it was

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.069 
because the paint was chipping it was
horribly<00:00:35.040> stained<00:00:35.399> on<00:00:35.550> the<00:00:35.670> outside<00:00:36.120> all
