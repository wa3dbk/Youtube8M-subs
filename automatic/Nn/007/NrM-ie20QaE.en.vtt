00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
doesn't need to be worried about any

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.039 
doesn't need to be worried about any
topic<00:01:20.460> because<00:01:20.610> a<00:01:20.850> lot<00:01:21.150> of<00:01:21.270> topics<00:01:21.509> about<00:01:21.810> his

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
topic because a lot of topics about his

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.630 
topic because a lot of topics about his
life<00:01:22.229> have<00:01:22.409> already<00:01:22.619> been<00:01:22.740> exposed<00:01:23.159> over<00:01:23.460> the

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
life have already been exposed over the

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.149 
life have already been exposed over the
years<00:01:23.909> he's<00:01:24.540> been<00:01:24.689> a<00:01:24.750> star<00:01:25.110> for<00:01:25.140> over<00:01:25.710> 30<00:01:26.040> years

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
years he's been a star for over 30 years

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.580 
years he's been a star for over 30 years
so<00:01:26.670> I<00:01:26.700> think<00:01:26.820> he's<00:01:27.090> pretty<00:01:27.270> used<00:01:27.630> to<00:01:27.810> having

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
so I think he's pretty used to having

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.069 
so I think he's pretty used to having
his<00:01:28.740> human<00:01:29.400> frailties<00:01:29.909> exposed<00:01:30.420> I<00:01:30.810> think

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
his human frailties exposed I think

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.719 
his human frailties exposed I think
people<00:01:31.320> don't<00:01:31.470> know<00:01:31.619> like<00:01:31.860> what<00:01:32.250> a<00:01:32.280> jokester

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
people don't know like what a jokester

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.060 
people don't know like what a jokester
he<00:01:33.000> is<00:01:33.150> like<00:01:33.509> what<00:01:33.720> a<00:01:34.170> comedian<00:01:34.740> and<00:01:34.920> what<00:01:35.040> a

00:03:26.409 --> 00:03:26.419 
I don't know there's so many things the

00:03:26.419 --> 00:03:27.819 
I don't know there's so many things the
list<00:03:26.599> is<00:03:26.720> so<00:03:26.840> long<00:03:26.870> would<00:03:27.380> be<00:03:27.470> difficult<00:03:27.650> to

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:27.829 
list is so long would be difficult to

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:29.610
