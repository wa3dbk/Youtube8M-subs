00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:06.759
 for this cold lemon pie recipe 

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:08.860
 let's use a base for pay that 

00:00:06.759 --> 00:00:11.559
 below I will leave the direct link 

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:17.669
 for you to learn to do this 

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:17.669
 base since it can be baked or not 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:24.609
 a philadelphia cheese a condensed milk 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:30.619
 a half cream 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:32.599
 and the juice of two and a half lemons can 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:35.720
 being less depends on you not 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:39.770
 want you to be very acidic 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:41.960
 and the zest of a lemon coloring 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:45.200
 green we will also occupy if you 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:48.140
 wants to give that little green color 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:51.410
 we add the carnation milk to our 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:56.030
 blender the philadelphia cheese and the 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:01:00.199
 cream and later the milkmaid 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:02.829
 and we add all of them completely to 

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:02.829
 liquefy 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:12.429
 since it is liquefied we add the juice of 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:14.579
 lemon with the zest and we are going to liquefy 

00:01:12.429 --> 00:01:17.920
 again just to integrate them 

00:01:14.579 --> 00:01:21.280
 quickly if I'm going to add the 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:23.490
 droplets of coloring just to give 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.490
 colour 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:33.210
 and we liquefy and add to our base of 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:37.460
 bread look at that delicious green color this 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.460
 pay girls will be very tasty 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.760
 and then that's how it was and we 're going to 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.000
 refrigerate 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:48.180
 the time we need to serve it 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.180
 at least 34 hours because I already see it 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:53.190
 that is like hardening there the 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.980
 mix but good hope I have them 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:59.120
 liked and see you in the next 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:59.120
 video bye
