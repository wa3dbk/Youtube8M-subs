00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 hello everyone welcome another day more to 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.670
 channel because in this video I'm going to 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.830
 teach how to install mods in your 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.940
 super simple central minecraft 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.320
 so nothing just before 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.370
 start with the video remind you that I 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.900
 you have to continue on social networks 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.089
 you are going to see my twitter for from my 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.740
 facebook and from the description of this 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.119
 video and that all the months we usually do 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.670
 a draw with either a telephone a 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.320
 smartphone or with a card with money 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.950
 that you can win so nothing 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.480
 guys let's start 

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:28.280
 good first thing you have to do 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.140
 would go to this page paisa have in the 

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:34.580
 description cell and you will go where it says 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:35.900
 by 1.8 not for version is worth so a 

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:37.790
 Once there we give you will lead a 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:40.130
 adf page line will wait 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:42.590
 five seconds it takes advertising and 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:44.540
 when those 5 seconds pass, we are going to give 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:46.550
 to jump and it will start to download 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:48.950
 automatically the modes that we're going to 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:51.470
 install later in minecraft the 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:52.910
 tutorial will serve for minecraft 1.8 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:54.350
 ok and that is if we do not have it 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:56.090
 updated in that version in the 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:57.770
 description I will leave the link so that 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:59.780
 go to the video how to install 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:02.600
 minecraft in its latest version minecraft 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:04.100
 in version 1.8 fully updated 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.930
 so once that has already been 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.119
 downloaded this cycle point file 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:09.950
 let's return to the desktop so 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:12.350
 as we see was teaching my version 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:14.270
 of man craft vale is my launcher the one 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:15.410
 I use it and if you want to install it 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:16.610
 then you are going to have it down in the 

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:19.369
 description as this deal totally 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:21.470
 updated works very well and the 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:23.600
 it really weighs pretty little so on 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:25.640
 this launcher 1.8 is where we are going to 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.170
 do the installation of the mods well 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.640
 well you know this because we are going to spend 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:30.110
 how it is installed 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.390
 well we will have downloaded a file 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:34.640
 zip like I 've told you before so 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:36.260
 let's move it to the desktop once 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.970
 we have done this we are going to go where 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:40.220
 it puts it to run good really there's no 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:41.960
 no site is the program this kit 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:43.940
 in windows here on the home screen 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:45.770
 so that we can execute some command 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:47.509
 program or file we simply 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:48.890
 let's put the code I'm going to leave 

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:50.960
 down there that will take us to the 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:53.150
 folder where all files are from 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:55.580
 minecraft us if we are using 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:56.869
 Windows from windows xp to windows 7 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:59.360
 this one is the method that we have to 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:01.009
 use and if god and if you have windows 8 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.619
 you are going to see that you do not have 

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:05.210
 that start menu or by - denis 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:07.399
 converts into windows 7 so 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:09.019
 you are simply looking for the application 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:10.580
 which is called executing me anyway 

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:12.410
 I'm going to put a screenshot here for 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:13.580
 that you see the application that you have to 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:15.140
 find what is called execute and 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:17.060
 then write the code that 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.739
 I wrote before it's worth so like 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.209
 you will see once you have already described 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:23.060
 depend on your version to take 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:24.860
 to this folder and well then simply 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.120
 once we are here we will see that 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.459
 we have a folder called point 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.989
 minecraft and this folder simply 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:31.910
 we will have to create a shortcut 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:33.860
 to the desk just very easy to 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:35.439
 we give to create shortcuts we go to 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:38.060
 go down and as you see 

00:02:35.439 --> 00:02:40.310
 minecraft direct access and that's the 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:42.349
 we copy to the desktop, we put it on 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:43.819
 here we are going to have everything clear this is 

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:46.760
 everything that we will have downloaded and everything 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:48.409
 what we have so we just go 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.790
 to take the folder of too many temps 

00:02:48.409 --> 00:02:52.310
 which is what we have downloaded before and 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:53.810
 we are going to extract the one that as we will see a 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:55.189
 once extracted and since I had some doubt 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:56.750
 of how to extract or I will leave a 

00:02:55.189 --> 00:02:58.670
 program under the description so that 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:00.409
 you can extract it and do it as I 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:01.849
 I do so once we extract it we will have 

00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:03.799
 to open the folder where he puts 

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:05.750
 minecraft we will give the other folder 

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:07.819
 prefers version and as we will see there 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:09.829
 we have one that puts 1.8 the only thing that 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:11.540
 we have to do will be give him to copy and 

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:13.250
 paste the other time in that same folder 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:16.700
 as you see now we have two one that puts 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:18.230
 1.8 1.8 copy in this second where it puts 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:20.750
 in a copy we are not going to create 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:22.670
 change the name and we will put 1.8 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:24.349
 mod is worth as much as I am 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:26.420
 putting now in aldama once 

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:28.340
 written we are going to give it again we are going to 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:30.139
 change the name and what we will have to 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:31.579
 do will be copy it so that 

00:03:30.139 --> 00:03:33.590
 we can put that name of other 

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:35.359
 folders we are going to open the folder that 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:37.459
 we just created and as you see we have 

00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:39.980
 two files the first one where you put 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:41.750
 1.8 that if we see next is a file 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:44.210
 executable simply because 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:45.950
 to paste the name is a hard file 

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:48.740
 we remind you this of the hard file and 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:50.420
 let's put 1.8 mod the same name 

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:52.160
 let's implement the snag we have 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:54.290
 than to put the same name that we have 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:56.060
 given to the folder is valid and in the other is 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:57.710
 we just do the same as this other 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:00.320
 will be a file is jasÃ³n then 

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:02.930
 we simply give the same name 1.8 

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:04.400
 mod points that are then once 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:06.140
 we have done this we are going to have to 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.880
 open the windows file we will know 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:09.350
 what program to open it with and we will 

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:12.110
 we will indicate that we want to open it 

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:13.640
 with the notebook and so here 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:15.350
 you are seeing how it is done as you will see 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:17.180
 it's very simple here if you simply 

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:19.280
 when the notebook comes out let's go and 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:21.290
 We give to accept here we will leave now 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:24.740
 this and we 're going to have to fix there 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:26.450
 where it puts 1.8 that is placed between 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:27.800
 quotes so we're just going to do 

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:29.120
 the same thing that we have done before we are going to 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:30.919
 give the same name to all 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:33.800
 we simply put respecting the 

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:35.990
 quotes we put quotation marks 1.8 space 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:37.580
 capital mode or just paste it 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:39.260
 that we should have it still copied 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:41.090
 and we remember that we have to respect 

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:43.730
 the quotes and when we have done this 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:45.890
 we close it we give it to keep so 

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:47.420
 around here this will be everything we will have a 

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:50.090
 file that is called 1.8 

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:53.210
 that is a sheet file and the other that 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:54.530
 it will be a 1.8 file that will be the hudson and 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:56.420
 well now we are going to have to choose 

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:57.920
 our file sheet and we're going to open it 

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:59.630
 with our program that we use to 

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:01.400
 unzip so let's open it with 

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:02.990
 him if you want this process to be the same 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:04.640
 Well, I'm going to leave the program as 

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:06.050
 You see that the hoist used to it 

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:08.300
 you are going to have to download it abbas with 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:10.790
 the description so just nothing 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:12.650
 let's go where it says open with that of 

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:14.090
 compressor is worth that mika socialize and 

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:16.880
 we have another one window because very 

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:18.140
 similar to this one is worth it so simply 

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:19.610
 once we have it open 

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:21.980
 let's open another window where 

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:23.480
 let's have the tumen items that is the 

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:25.070
 file that we have decompressed before 

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:26.510
 for the beginning of everything and we're going to 

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:28.460
 copy all the files of the two men 

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:31.250
 items to the folder that we have opened 

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:33.530
 before it's worth so nothing simply 

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:36.110
 we are going to copy all of them and we will have to 

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:38.240
 delete the folder that puts meta inf 

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:40.670
 just right button and we give to 

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:42.560
 eliminate so when this has been 

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:45.790
 done we can close this window and 

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:45.790
 move to the next step 

00:05:46.529 --> 00:05:50.489
 now we will simply have to execute 

00:05:48.239 --> 00:05:52.169
 the launcher that we have in my 

00:05:50.489 --> 00:05:53.939
 case if you want to use the same as me 

00:05:52.169 --> 00:05:55.739
 I use you can download it also from 

00:05:53.939 --> 00:05:57.599
 the description of the video so that the 

00:05:55.739 --> 00:05:59.159
 process is the same equal to the one 

00:05:57.599 --> 00:06:00.659
 I'm using but good if 

00:05:59.159 --> 00:06:03.959
 you have another launcher you can 

00:06:00.659 --> 00:06:05.069
 use what you use so 

00:06:03.959 --> 00:06:07.349
 now once opened our 

00:06:05.069 --> 00:06:09.299
 launcher let's select the new 

00:06:07.349 --> 00:06:10.799
 profile let's put a name on my 

00:06:09.299 --> 00:06:14.099
 case then we are going to put the same name 

00:06:10.799 --> 00:06:16.769
 that we have always used 1.8 mods and 

00:06:14.099 --> 00:06:19.349
 let's give it to where it puts its version and 

00:06:16.769 --> 00:06:20.969
 there we are going to give to version 1.8 and to 

00:06:19.349 --> 00:06:23.879
 what we put is very important 

00:06:20.969 --> 00:06:25.199
 because we're going to have 1.8 the 1.8 mod the 

00:06:23.879 --> 00:06:27.779
 important is what we have created worth 

00:06:25.199 --> 00:06:30.029
 the 1.8 mod we give you to save the profile 

00:06:27.779 --> 00:06:31.589
 and give the play button where it says it 

00:06:30.029 --> 00:06:32.639
 that once we're in the games and 

00:06:31.589 --> 00:06:34.259
 As you can see I already have the main craft 

00:06:32.639 --> 00:06:36.029
