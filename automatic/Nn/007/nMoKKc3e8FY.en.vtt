know anything about me and basically all

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:29.810 
know anything about me and basically all
they're<00:02:26.650> going<00:02:26.770> to<00:02:26.830> say<00:02:27.060> excuse<00:02:28.060> me<00:02:28.120> is<00:02:28.530> that

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820 
they're going to say excuse me is that

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:34.950 
they're going to say excuse me is that
I'm<00:02:30.820> the<00:02:31.150> latter<00:02:31.360> progress<00:02:32.400> um<00:02:33.400> and<00:02:33.750> I<00:02:34.750> think

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:34.960 
I'm the latter progress um and I think

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:36.300 
I'm the latter progress um and I think
that's<00:02:35.140> just<00:02:35.230> probably<00:02:35.530> the<00:02:35.770> answer<00:02:35.950> that

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
that's just probably the answer that

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:37.830 
that's just probably the answer that
they'll<00:02:36.460> give<00:02:36.700> everyone<00:02:37.000> and<00:02:37.390> I<00:02:37.450> don't<00:02:37.630> think

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
they'll give everyone and I don't think

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.480 
they'll give everyone and I don't think
anyone<00:02:38.200> really<00:02:38.350> bothers<00:02:38.830> calling<00:02:39.250> up<00:02:39.340> and

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:39.490 
anyone really bothers calling up and

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:43.850

 what<00:03:07.660> was<00:03:07.780> I<00:03:07.870> saying<00:03:08.850> the<00:03:09.850> worst-case

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 
 what was I saying the worst-case

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.920 
 what was I saying the worst-case
scenario<00:03:10.690> is<00:03:11.170> if<00:03:11.440> I<00:03:11.920> choose<00:03:12.459> to<00:03:12.820> eat<00:03:13.450> a<00:03:13.510> food

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:13.930 
scenario is if I choose to eat a food

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:15.690 
scenario is if I choose to eat a food
that<00:03:14.170> is<00:03:14.290> inappropriate<00:03:14.530> for<00:03:15.070> the<00:03:15.280> stage<00:03:15.520> that

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
that is inappropriate for the stage that

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:20.240 
that is inappropriate for the stage that
I'm<00:03:15.760> at<00:03:16.030> and<00:03:16.300> my<00:03:16.780> band<00:03:16.989> happens<00:03:17.620> to<00:03:18.100> slip<00:03:18.520> um<00:03:18.989> I

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
I'm at and my band happens to slip um I

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:24.479 
I'm at and my band happens to slip um I
will<00:03:21.250> have<00:03:21.610> to<00:03:21.640> have<00:03:21.910> surgery<00:03:22.239> to<00:03:23.489> reposition

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:24.489 
will have to have surgery to reposition

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:28.920 
will have to have surgery to reposition
the<00:03:24.850> band<00:03:25.090> and<00:03:26.220> statistically<00:03:27.220> a<00:03:27.930> secondary

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:28.930 
the band and statistically a secondary

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:31.229 
the band and statistically a secondary
positioning<00:03:29.680> of<00:03:29.890> the<00:03:29.980> band<00:03:30.370> almost<00:03:30.910> always

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:31.239 
positioning of the band almost always

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:35.790 
positioning of the band almost always
fails<00:03:31.770> um<00:03:32.770> so<00:03:33.730> you<00:03:34.420> know<00:03:34.450> that's<00:03:35.200> basically

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:35.800 
fails um so you know that's basically

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:40.440 
fails um so you know that's basically
the<00:03:35.920> worst<00:03:36.459> case<00:03:36.730> scenario<00:03:37.090> for<00:03:37.270> me<00:03:37.500> um<00:03:38.500> I<00:03:39.450> will

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:40.450 
the worst case scenario for me um I will

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:43.229 
the worst case scenario for me um I will
mention<00:03:40.690> that<00:03:41.020> I<00:03:41.080> was<00:03:41.170> very<00:03:41.860> very<00:03:42.700> very

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:43.239 
mention that I was very very very

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:46.759 
mention that I was very very very
careful<00:03:44.050> when<00:03:44.830> I<00:03:44.890> was<00:03:45.220> eating<00:03:45.850> the<00:03:46.330> slightly

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:46.769 
careful when I was eating the slightly

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:49.860 
careful when I was eating the slightly
more<00:03:47.769> solid<00:03:48.489> food<00:03:48.730> that<00:03:49.000> the<00:03:49.239> marshy<00:03:49.630> very

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:49.870 
more solid food that the marshy very

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:53.729 
more solid food that the marshy very
very<00:03:50.230> very<00:03:50.500> runny<00:03:51.510> scrambled<00:03:52.510> eggs<00:03:52.709> like<00:03:53.709> a

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:55.420 
the consistency you would make for a

00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:01.710
