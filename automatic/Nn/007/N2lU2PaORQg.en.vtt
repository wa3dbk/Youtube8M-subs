00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
national security interests at all but I

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:18.580 
national security interests at all but I
think<00:02:17.660> what<00:02:17.780> you'll<00:02:17.930> find<00:02:18.110> as<00:02:18.290> I<00:02:18.380> said<00:02:18.560> that

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
think what you'll find as I said that

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.020 
think what you'll find as I said that
was<00:02:18.770> actually<00:02:19.069> in<00:02:19.160> US<00:02:19.489> national<00:02:20.000> security

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
was actually in US national security

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:22.330 
was actually in US national security
interests<00:02:20.750> as<00:02:21.050> well<00:02:21.080> so<00:02:21.920> you've<00:02:22.040> got<00:02:22.160> a<00:02:22.190> lot

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
interests as well so you've got a lot

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.160 
interests as well so you've got a lot
deeper<00:02:22.580> in<00:02:22.880> there<00:02:23.030> what<00:02:23.540> is<00:02:23.630> the<00:02:23.780> interest<00:02:23.989> of

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
deeper in there what is the interest of

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:26.080 
deeper in there what is the interest of
US<00:02:24.470> national<00:02:24.920> security<00:02:24.950> and<00:02:25.520> in<00:02:25.730> doing<00:02:25.910> this

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
US national security and in doing this

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:28.300 
US national security and in doing this
in<00:02:26.300> Yemen<00:02:26.630> again<00:02:27.319> I<00:02:27.349> think<00:02:27.650> they<00:02:27.920> want<00:02:28.069> to<00:02:28.160> set

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
in Yemen again I think they want to set

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:30.040 
in Yemen again I think they want to set
up<00:02:28.430> a<00:02:28.520> failed<00:02:28.790> state<00:02:29.090> and<00:02:29.330> perhaps<00:02:29.480> they<00:02:29.810> put<00:02:30.019> a

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.050 
up a failed state and perhaps they put a

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:31.990 
up a failed state and perhaps they put a
military<00:02:30.500> base<00:02:30.650> there<00:02:30.709> and<00:02:31.220> with<00:02:31.730> everybody

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
military base there and with everybody

of<00:03:38.720> stuff<00:03:38.780> so<00:03:39.079> I<00:03:39.109> got<00:03:39.260> to<00:03:39.350> wonder<00:03:39.590> what<00:03:39.739> he<00:03:39.829> what

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:40.160 
of stuff so I got to wonder what he what

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:41.530 
of stuff so I got to wonder what he what
else<00:03:40.310> he's<00:03:40.459> going<00:03:40.670> to<00:03:40.730> do<00:03:40.850> with<00:03:40.970> this<00:03:41.060> hardware

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:41.540 
else he's going to do with this hardware

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:42.940 
else he's going to do with this hardware
there's<00:03:42.109> of<00:03:42.230> course<00:03:42.260> it'll<00:03:42.650> be<00:03:42.769> a<00:03:42.799> lot<00:03:42.889> easier

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:42.950 
there's of course it'll be a lot easier

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:45.520 
there's of course it'll be a lot easier
/<00:03:43.400> cece<00:03:44.090> to<00:03:44.209> go<00:03:44.359> in<00:03:44.420> and<00:03:44.569> stomp<00:03:44.870> on<00:03:45.019> Gaza<00:03:45.260> than

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:45.530 
/ cece to go in and stomp on Gaza than

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:47.500 
/ cece to go in and stomp on Gaza than
it<00:03:45.620> is<00:03:45.739> for<00:03:45.889> Israel<00:03:46.340> but<00:03:46.819> of<00:03:46.910> course<00:03:46.940> you've

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:47.510 
it is for Israel but of course you've

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:49.090 
it is for Israel but of course you've
really<00:03:47.750> got<00:03:47.870> to<00:03:47.900> look<00:03:48.139> at<00:03:48.230> the<00:03:48.380> bigger<00:03:48.799> picture

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:49.100 
really got to look at the bigger picture

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:51.550 
really got to look at the bigger picture
of<00:03:49.370> this<00:03:49.549> I<00:03:49.790> really<00:03:50.359> want<00:03:50.540> to<00:03:50.600> set<00:03:51.139> up<00:03:51.260> a<00:03:51.350> base

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:51.560 
of this I really want to set up a base

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:53.650 
of this I really want to set up a base
and<00:03:51.980> destabilize<00:03:52.700> the<00:03:52.850> whole<00:03:52.880> area<00:03:53.389> around

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:53.660 
and destabilize the whole area around

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:55.780 
and destabilize the whole area around
Yemen<00:03:54.109> and<00:03:54.560> I<00:03:54.650> think<00:03:54.889> at<00:03:54.980> all<00:03:55.069> points<00:03:55.340> towards

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:55.790 
Yemen and I think at all points towards

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:58.750 
Yemen and I think at all points towards
Iran<00:03:56.319> look<00:03:57.319> Cece<00:03:57.739> has<00:03:57.920> has<00:03:58.130> really<00:03:58.579> been

00:03:58.750 --> 00:03:58.760 
Iran look Cece has has really been

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:00.370 
Iran look Cece has has really been
rubbing<00:03:59.180> shoulders<00:03:59.209> with<00:03:59.690> Israel<00:04:00.170> you<00:04:00.260> gotta

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:00.380 
rubbing shoulders with Israel you gotta

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:01.900 
rubbing shoulders with Israel you gotta
remember<00:04:00.500> these<00:04:00.709> those<00:04:00.889> major<00:04:01.160> gas<00:04:01.489> fields

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:01.910 
remember these those major gas fields

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:03.940 
remember these those major gas fields
off<00:04:02.030> Gaza<00:04:02.269> as<00:04:02.540> well<00:04:02.780> a<00:04:02.989> lot<00:04:03.380> of<00:04:03.410> that<00:04:03.590> I<00:04:03.620> think

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:03.950 
off Gaza as well a lot of that I think

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:05.920 
off Gaza as well a lot of that I think
falling<00:04:04.519> to<00:04:04.700> our<00:04:04.850> Egyptian<00:04:05.120> waters<00:04:05.569> as<00:04:05.720> well

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:05.930 
falling to our Egyptian waters as well

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:08.110 
falling to our Egyptian waters as well
so<00:04:06.260> if<00:04:06.859> they<00:04:07.040> can<00:04:07.190> work<00:04:07.370> out<00:04:07.549> some<00:04:07.790> sort<00:04:07.819> of<00:04:08.030> a

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:08.120 
so if they can work out some sort of a

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:09.699 
so if they can work out some sort of a
deal<00:04:08.269> it's<00:04:08.480> all<00:04:08.600> very<00:04:08.750> profitable<00:04:09.380> for<00:04:09.620> them

00:04:09.699 --> 00:04:09.709 
deal it's all very profitable for them

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:12.099 
deal it's all very profitable for them
to<00:04:09.980> to<00:04:10.730> do<00:04:10.940> this<00:04:11.180> so<00:04:11.450> they've<00:04:11.630> got<00:04:11.780> to<00:04:11.900> make

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:12.109 
to to do this so they've got to make

00:04:12.109 --> 00:04:13.900 
to to do this so they've got to make

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:13.910
