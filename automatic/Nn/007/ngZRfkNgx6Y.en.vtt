can get up out of your seat and you can
look<00:02:33.650> for<00:02:34.480> what<00:02:35.480> you<00:02:35.690> might<00:02:36.050> need<00:02:36.200> to<00:02:36.620> have

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
look for what you might need to have

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.490 
look for what you might need to have
whatever<00:02:38.420> a<00:02:38.480> creature<00:02:38.780> or<00:02:39.050> a<00:02:39.080> character

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
whatever a creature or a character

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.130 
whatever a creature or a character
you're<00:02:39.620> animating<00:02:39.950> have<00:02:40.670> that<00:02:40.870> certain<00:02:41.870> vibe

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
you're animating have that certain vibe

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.650 
you're animating have that certain vibe
or<00:02:42.470> personality<00:02:43.190> to<00:02:43.400> them<00:02:43.580> that<00:02:44.390> is

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660 
or personality to them that is

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:47.410 
or personality to them that is
compelling<00:02:45.650> and<00:02:46.640> I<00:02:46.700> think<00:02:46.910> that's<00:02:47.150> what

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
compelling and I think that's what

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:49.720 
compelling and I think that's what
really<00:02:47.450> helps<00:02:48.020> your<00:02:48.530> work<00:02:48.710> stand<00:02:49.040> out<00:02:49.160> not

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
really helps your work stand out not

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:52.770 
really helps your work stand out not
only<00:02:50.000> that<00:02:50.180> but<00:02:50.500> of<00:02:51.500> course<00:02:51.740> the<00:02:51.950> other

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
only that but of course the other

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:55.420 
only that but of course the other
qualities<00:02:53.780> of<00:02:53.990> great<00:02:54.530> animators<00:02:54.950> that<00:02:55.280> they

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
qualities of great animators that they

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:59.680 
qualities of great animators that they
understand<00:02:56.390> weight<00:02:56.959> and<00:02:57.290> balance<00:02:58.660> not<00:02:59.660> only

00:02:59.680 --> 00:02:59.690 
understand weight and balance not only

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:02.080 
understand weight and balance not only
personality<00:03:00.590> of<00:03:00.709> course<00:03:00.920> but<00:03:01.310> essentially

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
personality of course but essentially

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:05.440 
personality of course but essentially
the<00:03:02.240> principles<00:03:02.810> of<00:03:02.959> animation<00:03:03.590> that<00:03:03.880> are<00:03:04.880> the

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
the principles of animation that are the

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:07.150 
the principles of animation that are the
building<00:03:05.750> blocks<00:03:05.959> to<00:03:06.140> creating<00:03:06.890> something

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:07.160 
building blocks to creating something

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.910 
building blocks to creating something
that<00:03:07.340> is<00:03:07.760> truly<00:03:07.970> phenomenal<00:03:08.240> and<00:03:08.810> I<00:03:09.709> think

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:09.920 
that is truly phenomenal and I think

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.390 
that is truly phenomenal and I think
that<00:03:10.070> those<00:03:10.400> are<00:03:10.459> the<00:03:10.670> traits<00:03:11.090> that<00:03:11.240> these

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
that those are the traits that these

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.300 
that those are the traits that these
animators<00:03:13.400> have<00:03:13.610> that<00:03:14.739> allow<00:03:15.739> them<00:03:15.950> to<00:03:15.980> get

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:16.310 
animators have that allow them to get

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:19.180 
animators have that allow them to get
the<00:03:16.640> jobs<00:03:16.910> they<00:03:17.180> want<00:03:17.890> what<00:03:18.890> I<00:03:18.920> think<00:03:19.100> is

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:19.190 
the jobs they want what I think is

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:20.259 
the jobs they want what I think is
really<00:03:19.340> important<00:03:19.790> when<00:03:19.850> it<00:03:19.940> comes<00:03:20.090> to<00:03:20.180> your

00:03:20.259 --> 00:03:20.269 
really important when it comes to your

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:22.930 
really important when it comes to your
reel<00:03:20.450> is<00:03:20.690> putting<00:03:21.620> only<00:03:21.860> your<00:03:22.010> best<00:03:22.220> stuff<00:03:22.730> on

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:22.940 
reel is putting only your best stuff on

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:24.310 
reel is putting only your best stuff on
there<00:03:23.120> and<00:03:23.269> even<00:03:23.480> if<00:03:23.630> that's<00:03:23.780> just<00:03:24.019> a<00:03:24.110> few

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:24.320 
there and even if that's just a few

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:27.040 
there and even if that's just a few
pieces<00:03:24.800> you<00:03:25.670> know<00:03:25.760> maybe<00:03:25.970> you<00:03:26.120> have<00:03:26.150> 10<00:03:26.810> pieces

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:27.050 
pieces you know maybe you have 10 pieces

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:28.420 
pieces you know maybe you have 10 pieces
that<00:03:27.800> are<00:03:27.920> calm

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:28.430 
that are calm

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:29.860 
that are calm
so-so<00:03:28.850> and<00:03:29.030> you<00:03:29.090> have<00:03:29.239> three<00:03:29.450> or<00:03:29.540> four<00:03:29.600> they're

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:29.870 
so-so and you have three or four they're

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:31.600 
so-so and you have three or four they're
really<00:03:30.200> really<00:03:30.410> good<00:03:30.560> spend<00:03:31.250> some<00:03:31.430> more<00:03:31.550> time

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:31.610 
really really good spend some more time

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:34.030 
really really good spend some more time
on<00:03:31.790> those<00:03:32.120> and<00:03:32.959> make<00:03:33.170> them<00:03:33.290> awesome<00:03:33.830> and<00:03:33.950> then

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.040 
on those and make them awesome and then

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:36.520 
on those and make them awesome and then
put<00:03:34.160> your<00:03:34.280> best<00:03:34.459> piece<00:03:34.700> first<00:03:35.030> I<00:03:35.410> think<00:03:36.410> that's

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:36.530 
put your best piece first I think that's

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:39.100 
put your best piece first I think that's
better<00:03:36.680> than<00:03:37.370> having<00:03:37.610> you<00:03:38.060> know<00:03:38.180> several<00:03:38.720> they

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:39.110 
better than having you know several they

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:41.380 
better than having you know several they
kind<00:03:39.290> of<00:03:39.320> dilute<00:03:39.680> the<00:03:39.860> whole<00:03:40.070> reel<00:03:40.700> you<00:03:41.269> want

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:41.390 
kind of dilute the whole reel you want

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:43.630 
kind of dilute the whole reel you want
to<00:03:41.450> focus<00:03:41.750> more<00:03:42.230> on<00:03:42.290> your<00:03:42.470> best<00:03:42.800> pieces<00:03:43.489> put

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:43.640 
to focus more on your best pieces put

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:46.600 
to focus more on your best pieces put
your<00:03:43.760> best<00:03:43.880> foot<00:03:44.060> foot<00:03:44.510> forward<00:03:44.870> really<00:03:45.610> well

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:46.610 
your best foot foot forward really well

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:48.490 
your best foot foot forward really well

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:48.500 
being an animator that's what I'm going

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:51.190 
being an animator that's what I'm going
to<00:03:48.680> focus<00:03:49.070> on<00:03:49.300> when<00:03:50.300> I'm<00:03:50.420> looking<00:03:50.630> at<00:03:50.900> any

I<00:04:49.380> think<00:04:49.770> another<00:04:50.069> thing<00:04:50.190> that<00:04:50.430> makes<00:04:50.550> you

00:04:50.629 --> 00:04:50.639 
I think another thing that makes you

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:53.480 
I think another thing that makes you
stand<00:04:50.819> out<00:04:51.030> to<00:04:52.020> the<00:04:52.139> game<00:04:52.289> industry<00:04:52.740> itself<00:04:53.039> is

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:53.490 
stand out to the game industry itself is

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:54.980 
stand out to the game industry itself is
showing<00:04:54.389> that<00:04:54.449> you<00:04:54.539> have<00:04:54.599> a<00:04:54.690> sense<00:04:54.930> of

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:54.990 
showing that you have a sense of

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:58.129 
showing that you have a sense of
community<00:04:55.199> so<00:04:55.889> being<00:04:56.280> involved<00:04:56.820> on<00:04:57.210> on<00:04:57.630> forums

00:04:58.129 --> 00:04:58.139 
community so being involved on on forums

00:04:58.139 --> 00:04:59.450 
community so being involved on on forums
and<00:04:58.259> things<00:04:58.470> like<00:04:58.560> that<00:04:58.650> having<00:04:59.039> that<00:04:59.250> sense

00:04:59.450 --> 00:04:59.460 
and things like that having that sense

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:01.400 
and things like that having that sense
of<00:04:59.639> giving<00:04:59.820> back<00:05:00.120> to<00:05:00.180> the<00:05:00.479> community<00:05:00.870> I<00:05:01.020> think

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:01.410 
of giving back to the community I think

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:03.230 
of giving back to the community I think
is<00:05:01.650> really<00:05:01.889> helpful<00:05:02.099> too<00:05:02.370> and<00:05:02.639> that<00:05:02.759> kind<00:05:03.180> of

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:03.240 
is really helpful too and that kind of

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:04.670 
is really helpful too and that kind of
just<00:05:03.300> gets<00:05:03.599> you<00:05:03.720> out<00:05:03.930> there<00:05:04.169> and<00:05:04.349> your<00:05:04.500> name

that sense of community when I was first

some tips for people they want to be
successful<00:05:33.650> in<00:05:34.650> the<00:05:34.830> industry<00:05:34.909> and<00:05:35.990> it<00:05:36.990> was

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:37.110 
successful in the industry and it was

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:38.209 
successful in the industry and it was
very<00:05:37.320> deep<00:05:37.530> what<00:05:37.650> they<00:05:37.770> told<00:05:37.949> me<00:05:38.070> they

00:05:38.209 --> 00:05:38.219 
very deep what they told me they

00:05:38.219 --> 00:05:40.820 
very deep what they told me they
basically<00:05:38.520> said<00:05:38.820> don't<00:05:39.180> be<00:05:39.300> a<00:05:39.330> jerk<00:05:39.630> and<00:05:39.870> they

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:40.830 
basically said don't be a jerk and they

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:43.100 
basically said don't be a jerk and they
didn't<00:05:41.070> say<00:05:41.190> jerk<00:05:41.460> but<00:05:41.849> I'll<00:05:42.630> clean<00:05:42.810> it<00:05:42.840> up<00:05:42.990> a

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:43.110 
didn't say jerk but I'll clean it up a

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:45.290 
didn't say jerk but I'll clean it up a
little<00:05:43.259> bit<00:05:43.409> but<00:05:44.159> the<00:05:44.250> basic<00:05:44.550> idea<00:05:44.789> is<00:05:44.849> that

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:45.300 
little bit but the basic idea is that

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:47.480 
little bit but the basic idea is that
matter<00:05:46.139> how<00:05:46.259> good<00:05:46.710> of<00:05:46.770> an<00:05:46.889> artist<00:05:47.190> you<00:05:47.310> are

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:47.490 
matter how good of an artist you are

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:49.730 
matter how good of an artist you are
when<00:05:48.479> you're<00:05:48.570> working<00:05:48.780> with<00:05:48.810> a<00:05:48.930> team<00:05:49.169> nobody

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:49.740 
when you're working with a team nobody

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:53.540 
when you're working with a team nobody
wants<00:05:50.099> to<00:05:50.130> work<00:05:50.310> with<00:05:50.550> a<00:05:50.820> jerk<00:05:51.419> and<00:05:51.630> so<00:05:52.550> really
