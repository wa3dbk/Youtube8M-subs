00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 this is the philips citiscape foldie 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:06.569
 bluetooth and stylish lightweight 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.610
 headphones with which you both wired 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:09.990
 as wireless via bluetooth music 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.309
 can listen 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.530
 the headset has one closed 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.599
 sound box and it is really a dishonor 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.930
 headphones for the earpads 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:21.000
 really on your ears and not over it 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.980
 must say that the ear pads are not 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.930
 so your feet are really soft 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.199
 sit on your ears 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.279
 so when you use it he has whole 

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:31.320
 minimalist brackets that ensures 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.329
 that it is therefore very light and the 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.149
 ear cups can be fine up and down 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:38.340
 move but not from left to right 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.770
 of course the headband itself is in 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.110
 adjustable length and also has one 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.390
 soft leather lining 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.789
 these headphones are so wired 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.100
 to use thanks to the included 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.629
 your headphone cable but as you can 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.550
 an intro declared can also be wireless 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.050
 use via bluetooth 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.629
 how you do that is very easy you 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.550
 just press this button and you 'll see it 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.350
 a blue light comes on and 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.409
 so you can use a different bluetooth device 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.060
 for example, attach your iphone to it 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.680
 yes so you really have a lot 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.930
 freedom of movement 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.479
 completely because you can also do your music 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:15.150
 control via the buttons on the earcup 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:17.820
 You can see the buttons here, for example 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.619
 sit to skip number 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.990
 and it is even possible a telephone 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:24.330
 have a conversation with these headphones 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.950
 that the telephone button is here 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.259
 so you can use that telephone conversation 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.720
 accepting and it has also at the side 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.979
 sit another microphone 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.470
 well how you let him up is whole 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:37.079
 easy thanks to this usb charge 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.570
 cable that you get with it and it closes 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:40.619
 you therefore connect to this connection on the 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.110
 earcup 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.689
 finally it's not for nothing one 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.640
 headphones that are full because it's called you 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:49.439
 very easy to fold and 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.570
 everywhere can take with you 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:54.420
 unfortunately it just does n't get a carrying bag 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.130
 degrees so be careful if you 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.890
