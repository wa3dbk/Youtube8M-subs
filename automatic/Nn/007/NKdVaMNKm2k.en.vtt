00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360
 even the best knife has to be 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:07.319
 to be sharpened 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:09.450
 we do the test with the example 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.969
 innovative razor-sharp twincharger 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.130
 select with its two separate ones 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:17.430
 creates modules become simple knives 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:21.410
 Safe and effective resharpening module 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.410
 1 removes slight damage 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:27.950
 and module 2 gently smoothes the waiting 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:30.510
 and just sharpen the knife 

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:34.430
 evenly and with little pressure 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:40.020
 pull the modules and they arrive 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:42.330
 optimal result with a diamond 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.610
 coated etschtal achieve 

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:47.100
 especially fine after sharper result 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.700
 There are many ways to steel 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.890
 hold 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.930
 The easiest way is to make the path steep 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.570
 down on a flat surface 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.910
 put the blade in the 20 degree angle 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.010
 to the steel and lead the knife 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.440
 from the beginning of the blade to the 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.600
 knife point in the light bow on the bed 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.880
 steel along this repeat 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:12.450
 Move a few times on both sides 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:14.940
 that sounds like a deal 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.580
 whetstone for example the twister and 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:20.910
 each other is easier than you 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:23.250
 think first pour some water in it 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:25.580
 the shell and moisten the surface 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.580
 of the stone 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:36.180
 Grind the blade first with the 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.770
 coarse grained side of the stone in front 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.840
 so you can also smaller ones 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.250
 damage the blade repair that 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.040
 knife is doing with a light 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:46.350
 pressure forward and to the side with the 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:49.080
 entire cutting edge pulled over the stone 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:53.760
 first one then the other side of the 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:56.130
 Messers important is the compliance of the 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:59.280
 Correct grinding angle usually 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:01.980
 20 degrees for European and 10 degrees for 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.780
 Japanese knife types when grinding 

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:06.390
 arises from water stone and steel 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:09.060
 Abrasive a polish fit the shear 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.140
 result, therefore, should not be optimized 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.900
 be removed 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.970
 for the final iv a deduction is the 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.250
 knife cleaned and in the same way 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:19.700
 with the fine-grained side of the stone 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.700
 polished 

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:27.989
 There are several possibilities 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:30.450
 to draw a sword over the stone 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:34.370
 we'll show you a very simple one here 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.370
 method that is easy to learn 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:49.070
 for Japanese knives with the extra 

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:52.610
 you need a sharp subtraction 

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:56.800
 in addition to the twister and pro 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:56.800
 even finer twin finishing stone pro 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:04.500
 so you achieve the perfect sharpness
