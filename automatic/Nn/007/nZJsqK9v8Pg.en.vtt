00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:40.220 
this is what I went to his store to get
I<00:04:34.830> needed<00:04:35.190> these<00:04:35.340> two<00:04:35.610> tiles<00:04:38.660> and<00:04:39.660> I<00:04:40.020> needed

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:40.230 
I needed these two tiles and I needed

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:41.629 
I needed these two tiles and I needed
these<00:04:40.410> two<00:04:40.680> and<00:04:40.980> there<00:04:41.100> were<00:04:41.190> some<00:04:41.430> that<00:04:41.580> had

00:04:41.629 --> 00:04:41.639 
these two and there were some that had

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:43.670 
these two and there were some that had
these<00:04:42.000> or<00:04:42.450> somebody<00:04:42.810> had<00:04:42.930> these<00:04:43.110> but<00:04:43.410> he<00:04:43.500> had

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:43.680 
these or somebody had these but he had

these or somebody had these but he had
both<00:04:43.919> sits<00:04:44.510> so<00:04:45.510> that's<00:04:45.750> why<00:04:45.900> I<00:04:45.930> went<00:04:46.139> to<00:04:46.290> this

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:46.380 
both sits so that's why I went to this

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:48.140 
both sits so that's why I went to this
store<00:04:46.500> I<00:04:46.889> probably<00:04:47.130> should<00:04:47.400> have<00:04:47.430> just<00:04:47.520> bought

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:48.150 
store I probably should have just bought

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:50.450 
store I probably should have just bought
these<00:04:48.650> because<00:04:49.650> they've<00:04:49.889> been<00:04:50.010> real<00:04:50.220> cheap

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:50.460 
these because they've been real cheap

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:53.170 
these because they've been real cheap
just<00:04:50.700> to<00:04:50.850> mill<00:04:51.060> these<00:04:51.240> but<00:04:51.630> I<00:04:51.720> added<00:04:51.990> that

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:53.180 
just to mill these but I added that

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:55.940 
just to mill these but I added that
hovercraft<00:04:54.180> so<00:04:54.870> I<00:04:55.110> paid<00:04:55.350> a<00:04:55.380> little<00:04:55.500> bit<00:04:55.620> more

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:55.950 
hovercraft so I paid a little bit more
