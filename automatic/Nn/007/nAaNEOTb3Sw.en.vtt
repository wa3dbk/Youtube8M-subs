00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:04.770
 hello how about very good guys 

00:00:02.549 --> 00:00:07.109
 Welcome to this new gameplay of 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.519
 I play lego the hobbit and we are with a 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:10.500
 new of the lego brick block 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.089
 red for this unlocking we have to go 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.940
 until this red interrogation that 

00:00:12.089 --> 00:00:17.210
 called the strongest dwarf in the world 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:20.179
 we set the destination there 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:22.369
 and so I think because on the map they mark us 

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:25.070
 a quite long way so 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:27.890
 we are going to cut the road by 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:29.869
 here since we're going to get a lot more 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:31.759
 fast very important for this 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:35.570
 unlocking must have already been forged 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:38.149
 the war hammer of my thriller well 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:40.579
 that take it into account good guys these 

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:44.170
 days I could not upload videos like 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:47.890
 some of you already know I was 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:50.230
 moving house and I have not had time 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:53.170
 for nothing and well I have not had either 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:56.019
 internet in fact I do not have an internet 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:57.550
 the videos that go up these days 

00:00:56.019 --> 00:01:00.190
 I'm going to do it from a cafe 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:02.260
 internet but good guys we have already 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:04.690
 come to the red interrogation we're going to 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:07.080
 talk to this character and see what 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:07.080
 tells us 

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:15.880
 I've been training 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:18.970
 with these trunk arms I could talk 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:21.240
 of a warhammer of 1000 out of 100 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:21.240
 tons 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:30.330
 in return I can give you something to 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:30.330
 you look so awesome 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:53.070
 You must be as strong as I think 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:53.070
 it's worth it 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:01.979
 ok guys and this way we are going to 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:05.250
 get the red ego brick that 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:09.090
 it's called costumes and it's going to cost 50 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:11.220
 a thousand pieces or coins of the ego 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:14.430
 ok let's activate this brick the 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:16.800
 red ego we go to the menu we go to extras and 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:21.250
 we look for it here we have is the brick 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:24.280
 of the red ego number 6 and we give him yes 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:27.130
 and we already have it active 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.390
 there is what this 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:30.850
 red ego brick then for 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:34.690
 disguise our characters this 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:37.709
 red brick is a typical in all 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:39.940
 lego games I do not remember any that 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:42.250
 I did not have this ego brick 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:44.050

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:46.510
