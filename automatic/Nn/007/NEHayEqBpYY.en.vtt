moment the output level of midi signal
is<00:01:09.650> fixed<00:01:10.780> this<00:01:11.780> means<00:01:12.080> that<00:01:12.200> it's<00:01:12.590> up<00:01:12.860> to<00:01:13.010> the

organ player to adjust the output level
with<00:01:16.160> the<00:01:16.310> swill<00:01:16.580> pedal<00:01:17.000> in<00:01:17.930> such<00:01:18.260> way<00:01:18.530> to

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340 
with the swill pedal in such way to

however if midi expander are installed
on<00:01:26.330> top<00:01:26.780> of<00:01:26.960> the<00:01:27.080> egg<00:01:27.290> 66<00:01:28.070> it<00:01:28.909> is<00:01:29.180> quite<00:01:29.480> easy<00:01:29.659> to

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:30.230 
on top of the egg 66 it is quite easy to

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:32.610 
on top of the egg 66 it is quite easy to
adjust<00:01:30.350> the<00:01:30.770> output<00:01:30.800> level<00:01:31.460> one<00:01:31.640> needed

adjust the output level one needed

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:35.860 
adjust the output level one needed
another<00:01:33.620> interesting<00:01:34.520> point<00:01:34.760> is<00:01:35.060> the<00:01:35.510> octave

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:35.870 
another interesting point is the octave

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:38.830 
another interesting point is the octave
selector<00:01:36.500> or<00:01:36.760> octave<00:01:37.760> Transposer<00:01:38.330> if<00:01:38.690> you

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:38.840 
selector or octave Transposer if you

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:46.610 
position lower normal upper in fact you

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:50.350 
position lower normal upper in fact you
can<00:01:46.880> adapt<00:01:47.409> the<00:01:48.409> octave<00:01:48.890> position<00:01:49.520> according

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:50.360 
can adapt the octave position according

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.160 
can adapt the octave position according
to<00:01:50.540> your<00:01:50.690> convenience<00:01:51.290> during<00:01:51.890> play<00:01:52.310> or<00:01:52.580> get

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:53.170 
to your convenience during play or get

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:56.350 
to your convenience during play or get

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:08.719 
optimal sound reproduction from the midi
device<00:01:56.720> let's<00:01:57.650> see<00:01:57.830> how<00:01:58.010> it<00:01:58.040> works

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.760 

let's<00:02:09.729> play<00:02:10.000> something<00:02:10.330> with<00:02:11.020> the<00:02:11.200> octave

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:11.770 
let's play something with the octave

let's play something with the octave
selector<00:02:12.250> in<00:02:12.459> normal<00:02:13.300> position<00:02:33.450> let's<00:02:34.450> put<00:02:34.660> it

existing 13 contacts per key would also

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:30.529 
existing 13 contacts per key would also
modify<00:04:28.229> the<00:04:28.289> touch<00:04:28.710> pressure<00:04:29.070> of<00:04:29.430> the<00:04:30.120> keys

modify the touch pressure of the keys

00:04:30.539 --> 00:04:33.110 
modify the touch pressure of the keys
