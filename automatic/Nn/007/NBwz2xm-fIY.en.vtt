parting my bangs at a triangle section

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.860 
parting my bangs at a triangle section
because<00:00:35.040> my<00:00:35.370> hair<00:00:35.610> is<00:00:35.730> thick<00:00:36.149> if<00:00:36.390> your<00:00:36.600> hair<00:00:36.750> is

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
because my hair is thick if your hair is

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.020 
because my hair is thick if your hair is
thin<00:00:36.899> you<00:00:37.410> can<00:00:37.559> grab<00:00:37.770> more<00:00:38.040> hair<00:00:38.100> everyone<00:00:38.910> is

thin you can grab more hair everyone is
different<00:00:39.239> and<00:00:40.579> then<00:00:41.579> you<00:00:41.760> could<00:00:41.879> use<00:00:42.059> a<00:00:42.090> hair

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
different and then you could use a hair

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.170 
different and then you could use a hair
clip<00:00:42.660> or<00:00:43.050> just<00:00:43.379> tuck<00:00:43.590> your<00:00:43.770> hair<00:00:44.010> behind<00:00:44.180> your

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
of the way so you could concentrate on

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.299

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
and then what I'm going to do is I'm

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.889

the<00:01:08.189> shortest<00:01:08.580> piece<00:01:08.909> to<00:01:09.119> be<00:01:09.270> I'm<00:01:09.510> cutting

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
the shortest piece to be I'm cutting

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.010 
the shortest piece to be I'm cutting
just<00:01:10.080> a<00:01:10.260> little<00:01:10.710> bit<00:01:10.860> below<00:01:11.130> that<00:01:12.020> just

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
just a little bit below that just

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.260 
just a little bit below that just
because<00:01:13.320> after<00:01:13.650> i<00:01:13.680> texturize<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.280> hair<00:01:14.490> the

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
because after i texturize the hair the

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.149 
because after i texturize the hair the
bangs<00:01:15.570> are<00:01:15.780> going<00:01:15.990> to<00:01:16.049> slightly<00:01:16.500> appear

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
bangs are going to slightly appear

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.960 
bangs are going to slightly appear
slightly<00:01:17.909> shorter<00:01:18.509> than<00:01:18.540> my<00:01:18.990> initial<00:01:19.200> cut

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:19.970 
slightly shorter than my initial cut

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:23.690 
slightly shorter than my initial cut
also<00:01:20.970> I'm<00:01:21.570> cutting<00:01:22.200> the<00:01:22.350> hair<00:01:22.560> dry<00:01:22.979> due<00:01:23.430> to<00:01:23.610> the

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
also I'm cutting the hair dry due to the

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.730 
also I'm cutting the hair dry due to the
fact<00:01:23.939> that<00:01:24.090> hair<00:01:24.869> can<00:01:25.140> stretch<00:01:25.380> up<00:01:25.409> to

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
fact that hair can stretch up to

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.560 
fact that hair can stretch up to
forty-five<00:01:26.250> percent<00:01:26.430> when<00:01:26.909> the<00:01:26.939> hair<00:01:27.210> is<00:01:27.299> wet

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
forty-five percent when the hair is wet

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.109 
forty-five percent when the hair is wet
so<00:01:28.380> that<00:01:28.650> means<00:01:28.920> that<00:01:29.220> after<00:01:29.579> you<00:01:29.700> cut<00:01:29.939> your

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
so that means that after you cut your

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:31.730 
so that means that after you cut your
hair<00:01:30.299> if<00:01:30.600> you<00:01:30.720> cut<00:01:30.869> your<00:01:30.960> hair<00:01:31.110> wet<00:01:31.409> it<00:01:31.590> could

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
hair if you cut your hair wet it could

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.950 
hair if you cut your hair wet it could
shrink<00:01:32.070> dramatically<00:01:32.729> after<00:01:33.030> the<00:01:33.210> haircut<00:01:33.689> so

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
shrink dramatically after the haircut so

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.780 
shrink dramatically after the haircut so
especially<00:01:34.799> if<00:01:34.920> you're<00:01:35.070> a<00:01:35.100> beginner<00:01:35.520> I

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
especially if you're a beginner I

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.450 
especially if you're a beginner I
definitely<00:01:36.360> suggest<00:01:36.590> to<00:01:37.590> cut<00:01:37.799> your<00:01:37.950> hair<00:01:38.130> dry

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
definitely suggest to cut your hair dry

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:49.399 
definitely suggest to cut your hair dry
for<00:01:38.909> very<00:01:39.180> accurate<00:01:39.780> results

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:59.649 

you

00:01:59.649 --> 00:01:59.659 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:02.319 

so<00:02:00.439> from<00:02:00.680> this<00:02:00.799> point<00:02:01.040> on<00:02:01.219> what<00:02:01.490> I'm<00:02:01.579> doing<00:02:02.030> is

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:02.329 
so from this point on what I'm doing is

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:04.029 
so from this point on what I'm doing is
I'm<00:02:02.570> slicing<00:02:02.990> the<00:02:03.289> hair<00:02:03.500> with<00:02:03.649> my<00:02:03.799> scissors

00:02:04.029 --> 00:02:04.039 
I'm slicing the hair with my scissors

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:06.969 
I'm slicing the hair with my scissors
without<00:02:04.490> pumping<00:02:05.240> the<00:02:05.450> scissors<00:02:05.840> open<00:02:06.409> and

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:06.979 
without pumping the scissors open and

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:09.609 
without pumping the scissors open and
closing<00:02:07.490> them<00:02:07.670> I'm<00:02:07.880> just<00:02:08.569> going<00:02:09.229> to<00:02:09.319> check

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 
closing them I'm just going to check

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:13.660 
closing them I'm just going to check
after<00:02:09.890> I<00:02:10.220> slice<00:02:10.670> and<00:02:11.060> then<00:02:12.220> slice<00:02:13.220> and<00:02:13.580> then

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
after I slice and then slice and then

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:15.729 
after I slice and then slice and then
check<00:02:13.940> my<00:02:14.150> hair<00:02:14.360> and<00:02:14.510> slice<00:02:14.959> the<00:02:15.260> hair<00:02:15.470> and

00:02:15.729 --> 00:02:15.739 
check my hair and slice the hair and

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:17.559 
check my hair and slice the hair and
check<00:02:15.950> again<00:02:16.250> and<00:02:16.489> I<00:02:16.610> keep<00:02:16.819> doing<00:02:17.150> this<00:02:17.300> until

00:02:17.559 --> 00:02:17.569 
check again and I keep doing this until

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:22.150

is<00:02:22.580> you<00:02:23.170> cut<00:02:24.170> a<00:02:24.200> little<00:02:24.560> at<00:02:24.830> a<00:02:24.860> time<00:02:24.980> because

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:25.550 
is you cut a little at a time because

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:27.460 
is you cut a little at a time because
you<00:02:25.849> could<00:02:26.000> always<00:02:26.180> cut<00:02:26.569> more<00:02:26.780> off<00:02:26.959> but<00:02:27.349> you

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
you could always cut more off but you

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:30.460 
you could always cut more off but you
can't<00:02:27.800> put<00:02:28.010> it<00:02:28.040> back<00:02:28.130> on<00:02:28.430> so<00:02:29.300> I<00:02:29.330> always<00:02:29.720> do<00:02:30.319> this
