hopeful hopeful for years and I think we

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.560 
hopeful hopeful for years and I think we
needed<00:03:52.760> someone<00:03:53.760> who<00:03:53.880> could<00:03:53.910> come<00:03:54.239> in<00:03:54.420> and

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:00.330 
Obama was that man for years ago and I

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:02.210 
Obama was that man for years ago and I
strongly<00:04:01.230> believe<00:04:01.350> he's<00:04:01.650> still<00:04:01.890> that<00:04:02.040> man
