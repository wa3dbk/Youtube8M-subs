00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:11.520
 I decided to study here in Tandil because it's a pretty good city and it seems 

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:14.419
 that was designed for the students. 

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:19.999
 I'm JoaquÃ­n Bengochea, I'm 21 years old, I'm from Rauch and I came to Tandil to study computer science. 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.520
 Since I was a kid I always liked videogames, so somehow, without knowing it, I was always 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:28.679
 dedicating many hours to computing. 

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:33.089
 I was interested in understanding how things worked, such as knowing what 

00:00:33.089 --> 00:00:37.920
 patterns were going to use the enemies to move and thus be able to win the games easier. 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.070
 Then I realized that I wanted to make a career that would serve for the 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.030
 creation of video games. 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:49.340
 Within the careers I could choose I decided on Systems Engineering for the 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:52.770
 career that he has and the high level of the career. 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.760
 Now I'm finishing fourth year and I'm already working so I can see the utility 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.720
 to many of the things that I saw during the race. 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:03.180
 I'm also working as a game developer, or video game developer 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.620
 in a company here in Tandil. 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:08.950
 In the company you can work in different types of groups. 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:12.440
 Moreover, some of my colleagues develop the smart traffic signal system that 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.440
 it is being used now in Tandil. 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.320
 I work in the division of the company that is responsible for developing video games. 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:20.370
 I'm in charge of the programming and design of these. 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:24.250
 It's good because you work side by side with other people from other professions, such as 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:26.280
 example sound artists or illustrators. 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.580
 Sometimes I think it's a lot like making a movie because you're creating a world 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:33.530
 new you imagine it, you create sounds, scenarios, spaces, characters 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:35.760
 that are in your head. 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:36.930
 Che, Joacko, 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.590
 the new graph arrived, 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:40.310
 Do you want to see how it looks? 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.050
 Let's see, I was just going to join the soundman 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:44.210
 but ... let's see how it looks ... 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:48.690
 We are about to start my first videogame. 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.980
 It's the first of many in my game developer career so I'm very 

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:55.620
 happy and with many expectations. 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:59.620
 To clear myself I practice a discipline called Tricking. It is a martial art that combines 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:02.770
 with acrobatic gymnastics jumps. It was always very important for me to have a 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:06.250
 cable to ground to be able to download and clear the faculty and work. 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:09.799
 It also serves to renew inspiration. 

00:02:09.799 --> 00:02:13.499
 You have an immense amount of things that you can dedicate to this race because, 

00:02:13.499 --> 00:02:16.749
 as everything is related to the computer in a certain way, 

00:02:16.749 --> 00:02:21.109
 You can choose the theme you want, from video games like me to medicine or robotics, there are many 

00:02:21.109 --> 00:02:22.249
 possibilities. 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:27.179
 Since I was a kid I was always a fan of video games, and thanks to this race I now work programming them and 

00:02:27.179 --> 00:02:29.739
 I can dedicate myself to those that I love.
