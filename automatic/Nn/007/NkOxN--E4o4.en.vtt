settings on this keyboard that sound
good<00:00:31.020> but<00:00:31.740> this<00:00:31.860> one<00:00:32.070> sounds<00:00:32.460> pretty<00:00:32.490> close

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:33.380 
good but this one sounds pretty close

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:35.990 
good but this one sounds pretty close
and<00:00:34.380> here<00:00:34.620> your<00:00:34.770> first<00:00:34.980> your<00:00:35.370> chords<00:00:35.790> that<00:00:35.880> go

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
and here your first your chords that go

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.580 
and here your first your chords that go
all<00:00:36.120> the<00:00:36.240> way<00:00:36.300> through<00:00:36.570> it's<00:00:36.690> an<00:00:36.780> ache<00:00:36.930> a<00:00:37.170> minor

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
all the way through it's an ache a minor

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.210 
all the way through it's an ache a minor
chord<00:00:37.920> AC<00:00:38.700> e<00:00:39.030> I<00:00:39.540> played<00:00:40.320> in<00:00:40.500> this<00:00:40.650> range<00:00:40.980> and

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:41.220 
chord AC e I played in this range and

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:44.479 
chord AC e I played in this range and
then<00:00:41.730> you<00:00:41.850> go<00:00:41.940> to<00:00:42.000> a<00:00:42.090> d<00:00:42.450> minor<00:00:42.780> back<00:00:43.230> to<00:00:43.470> a<00:00:43.500> minor

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
then you go to a d minor back to a minor

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.770 
then you go to a d minor back to a minor
so<00:00:45.420> the<00:00:45.539> D<00:00:45.690> minor<00:00:45.960> is<00:00:46.370> DFA<00:00:47.370> but<00:00:48.059> we<00:00:48.180> keep<00:00:48.420> this<00:00:48.600> a

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
so the D minor is DFA but we keep this a

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.319 
so the D minor is DFA but we keep this a
steady<00:00:49.350> and<00:00:49.649> we<00:00:49.770> just<00:00:49.980> slide<00:00:50.219> the<00:00:50.460> Cee<00:00:50.789> up<00:00:51.120> to

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
steady and we just slide the Cee up to

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.720 
steady and we just slide the Cee up to
the<00:00:51.449> D<00:00:51.660> F<00:00:52.260> and<00:00:52.710> back<00:00:52.890> down<00:00:53.160> so<00:00:53.370> it's<00:00:53.519> going<00:00:53.640> to

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
the D F and back down so it's going to

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.759 
the D F and back down so it's going to
sound<00:00:53.879> like<00:00:54.120> that<00:00:56.870> you<00:00:57.870> get<00:00:58.019> the<00:00:58.140> temple<00:00:58.530> just

sound like that you get the temple just
the<00:00:58.859> way<00:00:58.980> it<00:00:59.039> is<00:00:59.160> on<00:00:59.370> the<00:00:59.519> left<00:00:59.670> hand<00:00:59.910> you're

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:44.689 
off of that where it will change it up

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:46.389 
off of that where it will change it up
just<00:01:44.869> a<00:01:45.049> little<00:01:45.170> bit<00:01:45.259> that's<00:01:45.710> the<00:01:45.950> basic

00:01:46.389 --> 00:01:46.399

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590 
right hand and the cord so at that point

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:56.499 
right hand and the cord so at that point
i<00:01:54.920> dispense<00:01:55.369> with<00:01:55.459> the<00:01:55.580> chords<00:01:56.000> then<00:01:56.209> I<00:01:56.270> come

00:01:56.499 --> 00:01:56.509

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:00.550 
back to them but in the song action they
keep<00:01:59.240> those<00:01:59.390> cores<00:01:59.750> going<00:02:00.200> because<00:02:00.380> they've

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 
keep those cores going because they've

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.859 
keep those cores going because they've
got<00:02:00.740> a<00:02:00.770> lift<00:02:01.670> on<00:02:01.970> there<00:02:02.240> so<00:02:02.420> if<00:02:02.539> you've<00:02:02.689> got

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:02.869 
got a lift on there so if you've got

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:04.690 
got a lift on there so if you've got
something<00:02:03.470> where<00:02:03.679> you<00:02:03.799> can<00:02:03.920> make<00:02:04.099> the<00:02:04.310> chords

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 
something where you can make the chords

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.100 
something where you can make the chords
and<00:02:04.909> you<00:02:04.970> can<00:02:05.119> play<00:02:05.299> that<00:02:05.509> and<00:02:05.689> have<00:02:05.810> it<00:02:05.840> behind

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.110 
and you can play that and have it behind

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:08.589 
and you can play that and have it behind
it<00:02:06.470> so<00:02:07.310> that<00:02:07.459> if<00:02:07.549> we<00:02:07.670> play<00:02:07.909> it<00:02:07.939> we<00:02:08.209> start<00:02:08.509> off

00:02:08.589 --> 00:02:08.599 
it so that if we play it we start off

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:17.480 
it so that if we play it we start off
with<00:02:08.780> that<00:02:08.899> a<00:02:08.959> minor<00:02:09.319> in<00:02:09.500> the<00:02:09.560> D<00:02:09.769> minor<00:02:10.009> chord

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:34.000

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:48.469 

00:02:48.469 --> 00:02:51.709 

if<00:02:49.469> you<00:02:49.709> playing<00:02:49.980> it<00:02:50.129> live<00:02:50.400> I<00:02:50.969> would<00:02:51.359> go<00:02:51.510> right

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:51.719 
if you playing it live I would go right

00:02:51.719 --> 00:02:58.520 
if you playing it live I would go right
back<00:02:51.959> to<00:02:52.140> the<00:02:52.260> core<00:02:53.689> right<00:02:54.689> there<00:02:57.439> then<00:02:58.439> I

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
back to the core right there then I

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:10.280 
back to the core right there then I
would<00:02:58.590> switch<00:02:58.950> right<00:02:59.219> here

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.360 

and<00:03:11.290> that's<00:03:11.560> the<00:03:11.650> way<00:03:11.739> that<00:03:11.890> things<00:03:11.950> going<00:03:12.280> to

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 
and that's the way that things going to

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:14.940 
and that's the way that things going to
end<00:03:12.640> but<00:03:13.000> it<00:03:13.660> continues<00:03:14.230> on<00:03:14.379> through<00:03:14.680> there

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
end but it continues on through there

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:16.710 
end but it continues on through there
and<00:03:15.129> if<00:03:15.250> you've<00:03:15.400> got<00:03:15.580> it<00:03:15.700> loop<00:03:16.060> then<00:03:16.480> this

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720 
and if you've got it loop then this

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:19.650 
and if you've got it loop then this
keeps<00:03:17.050> going<00:03:17.290> right<00:03:18.220> there<00:03:18.489> after<00:03:19.360> you<00:03:19.450> come

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:19.660 
keeps going right there after you come

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:21.150 
keeps going right there after you come
out<00:03:19.840> of<00:03:19.870> this<00:03:20.080> but<00:03:20.349> if<00:03:20.530> you're<00:03:20.680> coming<00:03:20.890> out<00:03:21.099> of

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:21.160 
out of this but if you're coming out of

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:28.850 
out of this but if you're coming out of
the<00:03:21.430> vocal<00:03:21.730> line

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:28.860 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:31.260 

so<00:03:29.860> you<00:03:29.920> can<00:03:30.160> end<00:03:30.400> with<00:03:30.580> the<00:03:30.700> cord<00:03:31.000> here

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:31.270 
so you can end with the cord here

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:32.430 
so you can end with the cord here

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:34.690 
time making it to the cord up there Cali

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:39.060 
time making it to the cord up there Cali
living<00:03:34.990> key<00:03:35.440> of<00:03:35.530> a<00:03:35.650> minor<00:03:35.860> hope<00:03:36.610> you<00:03:36.790> enjoy
