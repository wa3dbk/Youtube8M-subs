00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:13.370
 starting 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:15.110
 the physical preparation section in the 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:18.470
 course of the level we find ourselves doing 

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:20.240
 a cross-country tennis circuit in which 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:22.790
 we have adapted a street circuit of 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:24.470
 physical preparation we also change the 

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:26.360
 stations to do a little bit of 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:28.670
 power from a bottom here we are 

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:31.130
 working power to a four foot 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:33.100
 jumps and they change in the station 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:35.289
 we have a burtis 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:38.530
 then we have here a squat type 

00:00:35.289 --> 00:00:41.100
 sumo to transfer and exit in 5 meters 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:44.510
 in speed up 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.510
 we develop with the fence 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:49.750
 other exercises 

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:52.390
 of skill and dexterity to be so 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:55.050
 tour that makes a comic touch 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:55.050
 he is with you 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.399
 above 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:08.710
 when you go with me 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:19.600
 or not 

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:32.210
 if we think that a piece of land that can 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.380
 cost $ 100 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:35.210
 we can do a training in 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:37.250
 internet suspension that simply 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:39.140
 with ropes for in this case the 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:41.679
 development of power or strength 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.679
 of the lower train 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:48.720
 we make an alternative work change 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:51.479
 of strength to one leg and climbing 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:54.170
 go down and climb on one foot, varying and 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.170
 changing legs 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:03.420
 now we apply a little power 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:06.380
 that descends and rises and gordon with a 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.380
 explosive jump 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:10.569
 I extended the rope always 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:16.380
 a little bit of strength to work the 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:18.900
 dorsal part 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:22.100
 we ask you to do repetitions in the 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.100
 area for back development 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:29.340
 and using all energy systems 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.870
 what else does our sport use the system 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:34.710
 predominant energetic we said it was 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:36.630
 the galactic analog therefore I 

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:38.940
 I can plan the exercise of 10 20 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:42.060
 seconds with recoveries and pause 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:44.070
 20 to 25 seconds we can six seasons 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.500
 and give him a break a minute and a half or two 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:48.150
 minutes and so again and I'm going again 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.220
 making blocks of that aspect are 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:52.200
 like the occasion game or something that 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.580
 can be reached in a set always 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.260
 taking into account the pause taking in 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:56.700
 hydration account and taking into 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.650
 counts a good warm-up before 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:01.920
 start activity start adjustments 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:07.040
 of steps and a little space 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:07.040
 multidirectional for the blows 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:51.239
 because that shows us that we 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:53.430
 we go work physical necessary to have 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:55.140
 the materials where you can assemble the 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:56.370
 stations on the street or any field 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:04:00.209
 open to work necessary a 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:02.150
 gym what was positive was very beneficial 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:05.000
 because you work 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:07.370
 arms legs a mean inside a 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.980
 circuit where all the two guys 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:12.080
 they are integrated 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:12.910
 in stations it seems very very good 

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:15.840
 work of 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:17.850
 only with 20 minutes we went to generate more 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:20.730
 things that do not work for the physical very 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:22.590
 well excellent this seemed very good 

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:24.830
 with everything that is practical we go because 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:27.419
 we do not need implementation 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:29.100
 we need to try to put in us 

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:30.630
 to try to deliver a little more with 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:32.540
 the guys in this physical part that is 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:34.979
 very important that it serves us all 

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:38.130
 to keep evolving in this that in 

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:39.930
 yes I think it's very good what we just 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:41.699
 to do because it is not necessary to have 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:43.800
 a large infrastructure or a large 

00:04:41.699 --> 00:04:44.680
 gym to be able to work in the part 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:46.570
 physical 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:47.949
 it gives us the rule that with things 

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:50.470
 simple that we can find a 

00:04:47.949 --> 00:04:52.539
 small circuit but in a good way in 

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:56.250
 where we work legs speed 

00:04:52.539 --> 00:04:56.250
 resistance and we can all achieve it
