00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:06.450
 to 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:16.449
 they have had that easy to clear clear 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.670
 there have been people who have died and 

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:21.849
 we have several dead throughout the 

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:23.650
 zone and there is not a place where a 

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:26.260
 record of that from the orders of the 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:28.150
 deceased from the amount of others 

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:30.160
 more than the amount of people who 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:31.570
 dedicate to them you have not thought about 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.490
 get organized 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:35.890
 our gold prospectors option 

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:39.100
 cannes we have not thought is not possible 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:42.040
 that they can die because if they are areas 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:43.530
 usually many are beautiful and that 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:46.100
 it's sand 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:49.860
 which are non-cohesive material 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:51.600
 they can simply collapse 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.450
 meanwhile the searchers 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.400
 tools in hand dig holes whose 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:59.190
 Depth extends to several meters 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:01.710
 and once they determine a cap they proceed to 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.930
 open tunnels the longer the 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.270
 tunnel greater the number of bags of 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.650
 land that will be extracted those that 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.470
 They enter the bowels of the earth 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:13.770
 that in this area is clay only 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.660
 they use candles to light up for 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.400
 work with excavation method 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:20.700
 holes a minimum of two is required 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.500
 people here trust is paramount 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.690
 between the group so much of whoever 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.030
 risks to fall as of who waits in 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:29.580
 the surface to the signal to climb the 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:32.910
 sacks that's why many groups are 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:34.920
 composed by complete families although 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:35.759
 the grounds where they dig are property 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.979
 private 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.840
 they claim to do it within 30 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.390
 meters that belong to the river margin 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.460
 and when they do it further they have 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.920
 permission of the owners whose only 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:51.410
 requirement according to them is that after 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.410
 finish tapen again the hole 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:02:00.960
 the obligation for those who are people 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:04.080
 they are human beings that I understand that 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:06.720
 they must have guidance even for 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.340
 that do not destroy the environment damage to 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:11.370
 environment can be caused by 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:17.310
 gold extractors if they are engaged in doing 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:19.230
 caverns that can accept the course of 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.209
 those that I cited the case of the 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.620
 belly that is giving a permit 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:25.020
 great and they are doing more damage 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:27.300
 ecological although we understand that they can 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:29.489
 be harmful to the environment but what 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:32.480
 we do as a means of d 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:32.480
 to live a means of subsistence 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:40.329
 just like it happened in california in 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:42.269
 1849 when deposits were discovered 

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:44.799
 unleashing the so-called gold rush 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:46.930
 attracting thousands of people from all over the 

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:49.120
 world the increase in the price of the 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:51.430
 ounce of gold in recent years has 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.890
 motivated many young people in the area to 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:56.500
 move great distances many 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:59.250
 times on foot and venture into the 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.250
 entrails of the earth 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:06.290
 I do not know about that, what do you do ? 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:08.480
 experience looking for gold and what time you 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:10.660
 dedicates him to a hole until he arrives 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.660
 material 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:15.290
 if it's dirt we start giving it 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:19.200
 I work until we even 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:21.030
 material we praise you do not wash in your 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.790
 experience your eight years of experience 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:26.060
 washing gold that is as big as you 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:26.060
 you have found 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:34.740
 and 6.9 degrees 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:34.740
 have to go why why not 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:39.770
 give me that he leaves then mixes with 

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:41.990
 the tail with him 

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:44.410
 of construction with gravel with the 

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:44.410
 same severity 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:56.040
 you have to get there because there is that gold 

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:56.040
 is mixed with that kind of material 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:04.280
 i 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:05.450
 you did not come back to them with a belly 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:06.830
 you know why 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:08.060
 because you think that I want the 

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:10.810
 young Dominicans work in 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:13.250
 construction because I had the Haitian 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:17.060
 rock with good healthy physique the 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:19.160
 Dominicans goal two motorcycles with chando 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:21.440
 although the activity seems very 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:23.840
 lucrative actually represents a 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:27.560
 method to survive since not always 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:29.480
 you run with luck many times you 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:31.669
 lava twenties some finds two stripes 

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:33.830
 I have come to find a bit that 

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:35.600
 It has 60 grams which is the most you 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:38.720
 found there are people who have 

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:40.460
 found that they have 80 150 there is person 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:43.340
 that has found pieces that have 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:45.770
 up to 500 grams despite the low and 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:48.080
 the risks that work have to wash gold 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:50.660
 represents obtaining income greater than 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:53.690
 average salary and thus try to alleviate 

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:55.400
 prevailing poverty in the area there is person 

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:57.050
 card or house they have made their home with 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:05:00.199
 that 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:03.460
 and they buy something to place 

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:06.880
 as refrigerator TV cabinet 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:08.460
 what the most important thing that people 

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:11.199
 Maintains the sustenance of his family 

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:13.539
 when they manage to collect some amount of 

00:05:11.199 --> 00:05:16.090
 gold the seekers go to the town 

00:05:13.539 --> 00:05:18.069
 where there are several buyers that at their 

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:21.690
 once they move to santo domingo and the 

00:05:18.069 --> 00:05:21.690
 they sell to those who export it 

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:28.240
 and that gold to 260 people 

00:05:31.289 --> 00:05:36.270
 that's what they have levels of 

00:05:33.029 --> 00:05:38.270
 casting is to make another era like that 

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:43.030
 they only found like this 

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:43.030
 we achieved together almost finished 

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:50.970
 at present , gold is quoted about 

00:05:46.979 --> 00:05:50.970
 $ 1600 an ounce 

00:05:52.289 --> 00:05:56.819
 and how you avoid being seen 

00:05:54.479 --> 00:05:59.879
 a false thing here that has a liquid 

00:05:56.819 --> 00:06:01.050
 who puts it to good gold I 

00:05:59.879 --> 00:06:03.750
 I know 

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:06.110
 that for then for 7 point I look at it already 

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:06.110
 you know 

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:10.360
 these informal miners who apply a 

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:12.610
 knowledge inherited from ancient 

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:14.560
 seekers are an example that the 

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:16.780
 state must do more to promote the 

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:18.670
 development of the area and that there are 

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:20.680
 enough sources of work to 

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:22.780
 young and old I am I do not 

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:24.970
 because I like it I do program but 

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:26.289
 for a means of subsistence for 

00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:28.449
 need 

00:06:26.289 --> 00:06:30.669
 If I had something else to do , 

00:06:28.449 --> 00:06:33.399
 would stop by automatically because as 

00:06:30.669 --> 00:06:35.199
 you will see it is not easy to dig a hole 

00:06:33.399 --> 00:06:37.599
 and go down and then said for a turn is 

00:06:35.199 --> 00:06:40.119
 easy at the end of each day 

00:06:37.599 --> 00:06:43.270
 hope is renewed and everyone 

00:06:40.119 --> 00:06:46.020
 returns to tempt the luck in search of 

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:46.020
 a better future 

00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:34.020
