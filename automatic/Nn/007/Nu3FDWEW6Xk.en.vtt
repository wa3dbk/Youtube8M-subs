technology that's out called a

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.029 
technology that's out called a
SodaStream<00:00:27.539> and<00:00:28.050> it's<00:00:28.710> what<00:00:28.800> we're<00:00:28.890> going<00:00:29.010> to

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
and it's what you need to do is you'll

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.840 
and it's what you need to do is you'll
have<00:01:06.689> to<00:01:06.869> get<00:01:07.020> this<00:01:07.170> ring<00:01:07.439> off<00:01:07.560> so<00:01:08.549> what<00:01:08.729> we'll

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
have to get this ring off so what we'll

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.880 
have to get this ring off so what we'll
do<00:01:08.970> is<00:01:09.060> it'll<00:01:09.210> rip<00:01:09.420> this<00:01:09.600> guy<00:01:09.810> off<00:01:10.020> and<00:01:10.560> it's

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.260 
do is it'll rip this guy off and it's
probably<00:01:11.130> a<00:01:11.159> lot<00:01:11.280> easier<00:01:11.310> just<00:01:11.729> to<00:01:11.820> use<00:01:11.880> like<00:01:12.240> a

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
probably a lot easier just to use like a

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.630 
probably a lot easier just to use like a
screwdriver<00:01:12.570> or<00:01:12.900> something<00:01:13.320> but<00:01:13.500> so<00:01:14.310> hit<00:01:14.520> this

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
screwdriver or something but so hit this

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
that's standard carbonation and then you

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:16.370 
that's standard carbonation and then you
just<00:02:15.120> want<00:02:15.270> to<00:02:15.330> make<00:02:15.420> sure<00:02:15.450> you<00:02:15.690> pull<00:02:16.140> it<00:02:16.290> off

that to spill out alright this is

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.490 
that to spill out alright this is
actually<00:02:26.040> now<00:02:26.220> carbonated<00:02:27.080> so<00:02:28.080> what<00:02:28.260> we<00:02:28.320> can

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
actually now carbonated so what we can

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:35.150 
actually now carbonated so what we can
do<00:02:30.920> take<00:02:31.920> our<00:02:32.130> vodka<00:02:33.890> pour<00:02:34.890> it<00:02:35.010> in<00:02:35.070> our

sparkling water bottle is make sure that
the<00:02:38.520> levels<00:02:39.380> line<00:02:40.380> up<00:02:40.590> exactly<00:02:40.860> what<00:02:41.340> the

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:41.460 
the levels line up exactly what the

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:44.240 
the levels line up exactly what the
other<00:02:41.610> ones<00:02:41.850> like<00:02:42.180> so<00:02:42.770> it's<00:02:43.770> just<00:02:44.070> about

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
other ones like so it's just about

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:45.590 
other ones like so it's just about
perfect<00:02:44.760> and<00:02:44.880> you<00:02:44.940> can<00:02:45.060> actually<00:02:45.210> see<00:02:45.480> the

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
perfect and you can actually see the

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:46.820 
perfect and you can actually see the
fizz<00:02:45.780> coming<00:02:46.170> through<00:02:46.350> there<00:02:46.500> then<00:02:46.740> we'll

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
fizz coming through there then we'll

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:53.080 
fizz coming through there then we'll
take<00:02:47.070> one<00:02:47.310> of<00:02:47.700> our<00:02:48.050> perfectly<00:02:50.180> unused<00:02:51.180> caps

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
take one of our perfectly unused caps

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:59.600 
take one of our perfectly unused caps
we'll<00:02:54.090> seal<00:02:54.360> it<00:02:54.390> right<00:02:54.630> up<00:02:54.810> and<00:02:55.940> now<00:02:58.160> we<00:02:59.160> have<00:02:59.340> a

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
we'll seal it right up and now we have a

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:03.620 
we'll seal it right up and now we have a
perfectly<00:03:00.030> sealed<00:03:00.330> sparkling<00:03:01.320> water<00:03:01.530> now<00:03:02.630> my

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
perfectly sealed sparkling water now my

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:05.990 
perfectly sealed sparkling water now my
Cruz<00:03:03.960> is<00:03:04.200> about<00:03:04.410> a<00:03:04.440> month<00:03:04.770> away<00:03:04.920> and<00:03:05.280> the

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
Cruz is about a month away and the

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.300 
Cruz is about a month away and the
reason<00:03:06.270> I'm<00:03:06.360> doing<00:03:06.510> it<00:03:06.720> so<00:03:06.960> early<00:03:07.230> is<00:03:07.710> because

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
reason I'm doing it so early is because

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.910 
reason I'm doing it so early is because
when<00:03:08.640> you<00:03:08.730> first<00:03:09.060> seal<00:03:09.750> these<00:03:09.960> there's

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
when you first seal these there's

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:14.540 
when you first seal these there's
actually<00:03:11.280> some<00:03:11.459> give<00:03:11.700> and<00:03:13.280> they'll<00:03:14.280> know<00:03:14.520> that

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:14.550 
actually some give and they'll know that

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:16.580 
actually some give and they'll know that
this<00:03:14.880> has<00:03:15.000> been<00:03:15.120> open<00:03:15.450> so<00:03:15.750> after<00:03:16.350> a<00:03:16.380> while

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
this has been open so after a while

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:19.130 
this has been open so after a while
it'll<00:03:17.400> be<00:03:17.580> harder<00:03:18.000> just<00:03:18.570> like<00:03:18.720> this<00:03:18.840> one<00:03:19.020> is

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140 
it'll be harder just like this one is

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:21.860 
it'll be harder just like this one is
over<00:03:19.350> here<00:03:19.380> and<00:03:19.770> so<00:03:20.550> when<00:03:20.970> they<00:03:21.120> go<00:03:21.330> to<00:03:21.360> not

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
over here and so when they go to not

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:24.430 
over here and so when they go to not
only<00:03:22.020> shake<00:03:22.320> it<00:03:22.500> one<00:03:23.370> you<00:03:23.550> get<00:03:23.700> the<00:03:23.820> nice<00:03:23.970> fizz

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:24.440 
only shake it one you get the nice fizz

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:27.590 
only shake it one you get the nice fizz
but<00:03:25.440> two<00:03:25.739> it's<00:03:26.610> gonna<00:03:26.730> start<00:03:27.060> getting<00:03:27.120> harder

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600 
but two it's gonna start getting harder

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.300 
but two it's gonna start getting harder
so<00:03:27.780> you<00:03:28.440> want<00:03:28.590> to<00:03:28.650> do<00:03:28.709> it<00:03:28.800> about<00:03:28.890> a<00:03:28.980> week<00:03:29.160> before
