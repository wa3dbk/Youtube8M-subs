00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
to do we have to put this into shower

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.940 
to do we have to put this into shower
island

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
island

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.529 
island
so<00:01:11.520> that's<00:01:11.700> what<00:01:11.850> you've<00:01:11.969> got<00:01:12.119> in<00:01:12.240> terms<00:01:12.420> of

00:01:12.529 --> 00:01:12.539 
so that's what you've got in terms of

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:14.240 
so that's what you've got in terms of
you<00:01:12.659> of<00:01:12.780> your<00:01:12.930> problem<00:01:13.289> video<00:01:13.530> and<00:01:13.920> you<00:01:14.009> have

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
you of your problem video and you have

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.029 
you of your problem video and you have
that<00:01:15.180> advert<00:01:15.750> following<00:01:16.289> your<00:01:16.770> actual

00:01:17.029 --> 00:01:17.039 
that advert following your actual

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:18.620 
that advert following your actual
statement<00:01:17.340> that<00:01:17.729> you<00:01:17.759> could<00:01:18.060> ask<00:01:18.210> about<00:01:18.450> your

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
statement that you could ask about your

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.510 
statement that you could ask about your
problem<00:01:19.020> for<00:01:19.409> the<00:01:19.500> students<00:01:20.100> I<00:01:20.189> think<00:01:20.460> that

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
problem for the students I think that

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.810 
problem for the students I think that
the<00:01:20.729> benefits<00:01:20.909> are<00:01:23.329> having<00:01:24.329> an<00:01:24.420> end<00:01:24.600> product

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:25.820 
the benefits are having an end product

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.179 
the benefits are having an end product
the<00:01:26.820> they<00:01:27.659> can<00:01:27.869> actually<00:01:27.990> see<00:01:28.350> themselves<00:01:28.920> the

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
the they can actually see themselves the

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:30.740 
the they can actually see themselves the
journey<00:01:29.460> of<00:01:29.610> where<00:01:29.909> they're<00:01:30.090> started<00:01:30.569> where

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
journey of where they're started where

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.660 
journey of where they're started where
they're<00:01:30.899> up<00:01:31.020> to<00:01:31.200> now<00:01:31.439> finally<00:01:32.429> the<00:01:32.549> end

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
they're up to now finally the end

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.969 
they're up to now finally the end
product<00:01:32.939> of<00:01:33.179> actually<00:01:33.539> producing<00:01:34.020> a<00:01:34.110> nap<00:01:34.289> for

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
product of actually producing a nap for

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.580 
product of actually producing a nap for
an<00:01:35.039> Android<00:01:35.399> device<00:01:35.700> I<00:01:36.030> think<00:01:36.179> that's

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:36.590 
an Android device I think that's

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:39.289 
an Android device I think that's
something<00:01:37.590> that<00:01:37.890> they're<00:01:38.340> can<00:01:38.490> focus<00:01:38.759> on<00:01:39.119> any

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
something that they're can focus on any

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.410 
something that they're can focus on any
I<00:01:39.569> was<00:01:40.020> a<00:01:40.289> student<00:01:40.710> make<00:01:41.490> me<00:01:41.700> more<00:01:41.880> driven<00:01:42.179> to

I was a student make me more driven to

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:43.880 
I was a student make me more driven to
kind<00:01:42.659> of<00:01:42.750> succeed<00:01:43.200> and<00:01:43.380> make<00:01:43.439> sure<00:01:43.560> I've<00:01:43.830> got

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
kind of succeed and make sure I've got

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.980 
kind of succeed and make sure I've got
everything<00:01:44.220> right<00:01:45.060> for<00:01:45.479> the<00:01:45.569> final

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
everything right for the final

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.499 
everything right for the final
production<00:01:46.830> of<00:01:47.159> that<00:01:47.310> app<00:01:47.429> we<00:01:48.030> started<00:01:48.390> this

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
production of that app we started this

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:52.370 
production of that app we started this

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.120 
how many things you could get out of it

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.729 
how many things you could get out of it
absolutely<00:03:15.120> took<00:03:15.389> small<00:03:15.540> boxes<00:03:16.049> than<00:03:16.290> most
