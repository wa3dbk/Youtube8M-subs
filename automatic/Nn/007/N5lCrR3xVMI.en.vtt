00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:49.490 
sit inside the vehicle what we try to do

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:51.010 
sit inside the vehicle what we try to do
is<00:01:49.670> that<00:01:49.880> you<00:01:49.910> have<00:01:50.240> this<00:01:50.390> touchscreen

is that you have this touchscreen

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.230 
is that you have this touchscreen
navigation<00:01:51.160> where<00:01:52.160> it's<00:01:52.250> very<00:01:52.550> easy<00:01:52.790> to<00:01:53.000> read

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:53.240 
navigation where it's very easy to read

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.720 
navigation where it's very easy to read
and<00:01:53.570> very<00:01:53.870> logical<00:01:54.380> to<00:01:54.410> we<00:01:55.070> immediately<00:01:55.520> get

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:55.730 
and very logical to we immediately get

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:57.910 
and very logical to we immediately get
the<00:01:55.760> response<00:01:56.270> you<00:01:56.450> want<00:01:56.600> or<00:01:57.260> you<00:01:57.560> use<00:01:57.710> the

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:01.220 
button in the center console so we we

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:02.770 
button in the center console so we we
have<00:02:01.310> found<00:02:01.550> this<00:02:01.700> to<00:02:01.760> be<00:02:01.910> the<00:02:02.030> most<00:02:02.240> logical

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:02.780 
have found this to be the most logical

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:05.050 
have found this to be the most logical
and<00:02:02.900> easy<00:02:03.020> way<00:02:03.260> to<00:02:03.290> handle<00:02:03.590> it<00:02:03.800> and<00:02:04.070> of<00:02:04.760> course

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 
and easy way to handle it and of course

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:06.790 
and easy way to handle it and of course
new<00:02:05.270> technologies<00:02:05.810> requires<00:02:06.200> new<00:02:06.440> knowledge

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:06.800 
new technologies requires new knowledge

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.340 
new technologies requires new knowledge
but<00:02:07.460> it's<00:02:07.910> if<00:02:08.300> you<00:02:08.420> buy<00:02:08.570> a<00:02:08.600> new<00:02:08.750> mobile<00:02:08.929> phone

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:09.350 
but it's if you buy a new mobile phone

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:10.780 
but it's if you buy a new mobile phone
you<00:02:09.560> also<00:02:09.679> have<00:02:09.890> to<00:02:10.009> learn<00:02:10.160> how<00:02:10.399> that<00:02:10.580> one

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:10.790 
you also have to learn how that one

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:13.330 
you also have to learn how that one
works<00:02:10.970> and<00:02:11.390> it's<00:02:11.960> also<00:02:12.110> we<00:02:12.709> need<00:02:12.830> to<00:02:12.980> be<00:02:13.100> there

works and it's also we need to be there

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.400 
works and it's also we need to be there
to<00:02:13.730> be<00:02:13.820> able<00:02:13.880> to<00:02:14.090> attract<00:02:14.390> all<00:02:14.570> customers<00:02:15.080> and

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
well we have developed it jointly I mean

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.009 
well we have developed it jointly I mean
the<00:02:41.760> things<00:02:42.239> that<00:02:42.390> will<00:02:42.480> happen<00:02:42.780> the<00:02:42.870> layer

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:43.019 
the things that will happen the layer

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:45.050 
the things that will happen the layer
last<00:02:43.319> six<00:02:43.620> months<00:02:43.980> is<00:02:44.099> nothing<00:02:44.400> we<00:02:44.489> can<00:02:44.670> just

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
last six months is nothing we can just

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.179 
last six months is nothing we can just
turn<00:02:45.629> around<00:02:45.810> I<00:02:46.200> mean<00:02:46.349> that's<00:02:46.590> part<00:02:46.860> of<00:02:47.040> the

00:02:47.179 --> 00:02:47.189 
turn around I mean that's part of the

00:02:47.189 --> 00:02:49.250 
turn around I mean that's part of the
history<00:02:47.280> we've<00:02:47.760> been<00:02:47.939> with<00:02:48.120> GM<00:02:48.450> for<00:02:48.750> many

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
history we've been with GM for many

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:50.750 
history we've been with GM for many
years<00:02:49.530> and<00:02:49.890> we're<00:02:50.099> gonna<00:02:50.250> continue<00:02:50.489> to

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
years and we're gonna continue to

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.670 
years and we're gonna continue to
cooperate<00:02:51.209> with<00:02:51.599> them<00:02:51.780> through<00:02:52.379> different

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
cooperate with them through different

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.280 
cooperate with them through different
service<00:02:53.189> agreements<00:02:53.760> and<00:02:53.909> the<00:02:54.870> core<00:02:55.110> is

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
service agreements and the core is

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.580 
service agreements and the core is
developed<00:02:55.950> by<00:02:56.220> Saab<00:02:56.700> people<00:02:57.180> mainly<00:02:57.629> and<00:02:57.840> has

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
developed by Saab people mainly and has

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.530 
developed by Saab people mainly and has
all<00:02:58.799> the<00:02:58.950> Saab<00:02:59.129> characteristics<00:02:59.970> and<00:03:00.269> of

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
all the Saab characteristics and of

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.539 
all the Saab characteristics and of
course<00:03:00.780> there<00:03:00.989> are<00:03:01.079> parts<00:03:01.890> that<00:03:01.980> we<00:03:02.370> use

00:03:02.539 --> 00:03:02.549 
course there are parts that we use

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:05.080 
course there are parts that we use
common<00:03:03.090> that<00:03:03.269> is<00:03:03.480> part<00:03:03.780> of<00:03:03.989> the<00:03:04.829> common

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.090 
common that is part of the common

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:13.630 
common that is part of the common
architecture<00:03:06.090> of<00:03:06.209> course

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:13.640 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.570 

I<00:03:13.900> think<00:03:14.900> the<00:03:14.990> combination<00:03:15.200> of<00:03:15.680> a<00:03:15.830> really<00:03:16.370> nice

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:16.580 
I think the combination of a really nice

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:18.160 
I think the combination of a really nice
premium<00:03:17.150> vehicle<00:03:17.540> where<00:03:17.720> you<00:03:17.750> can<00:03:17.990> drive

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.170 
premium vehicle where you can drive

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:20.230 
premium vehicle where you can drive
comfortable<00:03:18.440> but<00:03:19.069> still<00:03:19.340> have<00:03:19.610> this

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:20.240 
comfortable but still have this

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:22.840 
comfortable but still have this
progressive<00:03:21.080> feeling<00:03:22.069> well<00:03:22.280> and<00:03:22.610> as<00:03:22.700> an

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:22.850 
progressive feeling well and as an

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:25.570 
progressive feeling well and as an
active<00:03:23.300> driver<00:03:23.630> so<00:03:24.440> even<00:03:25.100> though<00:03:25.190> it's<00:03:25.340> a<00:03:25.400> big

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:25.580 
active driver so even though it's a big

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:28.420 
active driver so even though it's a big
car<00:03:25.850> it<00:03:26.270> still<00:03:26.660> involves<00:03:27.140> the<00:03:27.410> driver<00:03:27.740> in<00:03:28.250> a

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:28.430 
car it still involves the driver in a

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:30.430 
car it still involves the driver in a
very<00:03:28.610> intuitive<00:03:28.910> way<00:03:29.180> so<00:03:29.390> it<00:03:30.110> doesn't<00:03:30.380> get

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:30.440 
very intuitive way so it doesn't get

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:32.770 
very intuitive way so it doesn't get
boring<00:03:30.650> and<00:03:31.070> I<00:03:31.670> think<00:03:31.880> we<00:03:32.120> need<00:03:32.240> to<00:03:32.360> keep<00:03:32.510> that

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:32.780 
boring and I think we need to keep that

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:34.510 
boring and I think we need to keep that
as<00:03:32.990> one<00:03:33.230> of<00:03:33.260> the<00:03:33.500> very<00:03:33.800> important<00:03:34.310> soft

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:34.520 
as one of the very important soft

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:36.730 
as one of the very important soft
features<00:03:34.790> for<00:03:35.270> us<00:03:35.390> that<00:03:35.570> you're<00:03:36.290> the<00:03:36.470> driver

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:36.740 
features for us that you're the driver

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:40.209 
features for us that you're the driver
in<00:03:36.920> control<00:03:37.280> and<00:03:37.550> that's<00:03:37.640> how<00:03:37.850> it<00:03:38.000> should<00:03:38.030> be
