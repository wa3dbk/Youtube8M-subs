not enough gold I pretty sure I have
enough<00:00:55.969> oh<00:00:56.300> no<00:00:57.260> that's<00:00:57.680> that's<00:00:57.920> energy<00:00:58.160> I

00:00:58.509 --> 00:00:58.519 
enough oh no that's that's energy I

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:02.110 
enough oh no that's that's energy I
spent<00:00:59.329> all<00:00:59.449> of<00:00:59.480> my<00:01:00.309> mikemaya<00:01:01.309> golden<00:01:01.910> energy

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:02.120 
spent all of my mikemaya golden energy

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:09.700 
spent all of my mikemaya golden energy
anyways<00:01:02.750> the<00:01:03.710> suit<00:01:03.980> is<00:01:04.759> it's<00:01:05.479> pretty<00:01:05.630> cool<00:01:08.710> it

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:09.710 
anyways the suit is it's pretty cool it

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:11.670 
anyways the suit is it's pretty cool it
generates<00:01:10.700> a<00:01:10.790> force<00:01:10.940> field<00:01:11.240> and<00:01:11.390> it<00:01:11.479> basically

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:11.680 
generates a force field and it basically

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:13.600 
generates a force field and it basically
heals<00:01:12.680> you

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:13.610 
heals you

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:17.350 
heals you
so<00:01:14.240> if<00:01:14.570> you<00:01:15.229> have<00:01:15.380> this<00:01:15.560> active<00:01:16.040> and<00:01:16.369> someone

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:17.360 
so if you have this active and someone

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.180 
so if you have this active and someone
starts<00:01:17.630> to<00:01:17.720> attack<00:01:17.960> you<00:01:18.229> you<00:01:18.440> start<00:01:18.890> healing

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:19.190 
starts to attack you you start healing

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:21.730 
starts to attack you you start healing
so<00:01:19.549> that's<00:01:19.700> pretty<00:01:19.940> that's<00:01:20.690> pretty<00:01:20.840> nifty<00:01:21.229> I

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:21.740 
so that's pretty that's pretty nifty I

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.669 
so that's pretty that's pretty nifty I
think<00:01:22.550> this<00:01:22.880> might<00:01:23.149> replace<00:01:23.570> my<00:01:23.840> night<00:01:24.080> set<00:01:24.470> as

00:01:24.669 --> 00:01:24.679 
think this might replace my night set as

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:27.850 
think this might replace my night set as
my<00:01:24.979> favorite<00:01:25.750> armor<00:01:26.750> to<00:01:26.899> use<00:01:27.170> so<00:01:27.500> we'll<00:01:27.679> just

cuz<00:02:39.490> I'll<00:02:39.640> they'll<00:02:40.030> heal<00:02:40.240> you<00:02:40.420> real<00:02:40.630> fast<00:02:41.190> but

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190 
cuz I'll they'll heal you real fast but

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:44.640 
cuz I'll they'll heal you real fast but
it's<00:02:42.340> just<00:02:42.520> a<00:02:42.610> nice<00:02:42.930> nice<00:02:43.930> little<00:02:43.990> suit

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
it's just a nice nice little suit

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:47.400 
it's just a nice nice little suit
ability<00:02:45.100> that<00:02:45.340> can<00:02:45.640> probably<00:02:46.510> save<00:02:47.050> you<00:02:47.260> if

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.410 
ability that can probably save you if

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:50.190 
ability that can probably save you if
you're<00:02:47.650> in<00:02:47.890> a<00:02:48.490> tight<00:02:48.700> spot<00:02:49.060> it's<00:02:49.930> probably

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
you're in a tight spot it's probably

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.790 
you're in a tight spot it's probably
pretty<00:02:50.320> good<00:02:50.410> for<00:02:50.680> PvP<00:02:51.070> as<00:02:51.190> well<00:02:51.370> because<00:02:51.850> that

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 
pretty good for PvP as well because that

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:57.080 
pretty good for PvP as well because that
does<00:02:53.800> give<00:02:54.160> you<00:02:54.310> guaranteed<00:02:55.920> invincibility

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
does give you guaranteed invincibility

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.750 
does give you guaranteed invincibility
to<00:02:58.090> sniper<00:02:58.990> fire<00:02:59.410> so<00:03:00.040> I<00:03:00.070> think<00:03:00.190> you<00:03:00.400> can<00:03:00.550> pop

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
to sniper fire so I think you can pop

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:04.510 
to sniper fire so I think you can pop
that<00:03:01.000> thing<00:03:01.270> off<00:03:01.540> and

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:04.520 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:06.760 

pretty<00:03:05.180> much<00:03:05.390> just<00:03:05.450> be<00:03:05.810> invincible<00:03:06.140> for<00:03:06.710> a

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:06.770 
pretty much just be invincible for a

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:09.580 
pretty much just be invincible for a
little<00:03:06.950> bit<00:03:07.150> I<00:03:08.230> haven't<00:03:09.230> done<00:03:09.320> a<00:03:09.380> whole<00:03:09.470> lot

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:09.590 
little bit I haven't done a whole lot

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:13.000 
little bit I haven't done a whole lot
yet<00:03:09.980> with<00:03:10.220> uh<00:03:10.270> with<00:03:11.270> PvP<00:03:11.810> just<00:03:12.050> cuz<00:03:12.260> um<00:03:12.500> I'm

still a little laggy for one reason or

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:21.970 
still a little laggy for one reason or
another<00:03:19.420> yeah<00:03:20.420> it's<00:03:20.690> it's<00:03:21.080> it's<00:03:21.560> pretty<00:03:21.620> cool

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:21.980 
another yeah it's it's it's pretty cool

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:25.840 
another yeah it's it's it's pretty cool
new<00:03:22.160> set<00:03:23.440> there<00:03:24.440> was<00:03:24.650> not<00:03:25.010> a<00:03:25.040> backpack<00:03:25.430> that

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:25.850 
new set there was not a backpack that

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:28.060 
new set there was not a backpack that
went<00:03:26.060> with<00:03:26.240> it<00:03:26.420> though<00:03:26.600> so<00:03:26.930> I<00:03:26.960> don't<00:03:27.110> I<00:03:27.530> kind<00:03:28.040> of

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:28.070 
went with it though so I don't I kind of

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:31.090 
went with it though so I don't I kind of
wish<00:03:28.250> there<00:03:28.430> was<00:03:28.610> but<00:03:29.030> I<00:03:29.500> guess<00:03:30.500> it<00:03:30.800> all<00:03:30.890> works

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:31.100 
wish there was but I guess it all works

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:34.320 
wish there was but I guess it all works
out<00:03:31.310> because<00:03:31.610> you<00:03:31.910> can<00:03:32.090> you<00:03:32.570> can<00:03:32.720> use<00:03:32.960> the<00:03:33.170> the

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:34.330 
out because you can you can use the the

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:37.350 
out because you can you can use the the
one<00:03:35.330> that<00:03:35.480> came<00:03:35.630> with<00:03:35.660> a<00:03:35.840> knight<00:03:36.110> you<00:03:36.500> use<00:03:37.190> a

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:37.360 
one that came with a knight you use a

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.330 
one that came with a knight you use a
shield<00:03:38.360> backpack<00:03:38.870> which<00:03:39.710> is<00:03:39.860> probably<00:03:40.160> still

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:40.340 
shield backpack which is probably still

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:43.900 
shield backpack which is probably still
my<00:03:40.460> favorite<00:03:40.820> backpack<00:03:41.240> this<00:03:41.650> it<00:03:42.650> uh<00:03:42.760> it<00:03:43.760> does

a crapload of damage and it also it also
heals<00:03:48.650> you<00:03:48.860> so<00:03:49.130> that's<00:03:49.580> always<00:03:49.820> good

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:15.310 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:17.370 

I<00:04:15.340> don't<00:04:15.970> know<00:04:16.030> why<00:04:16.209> I<00:04:16.239> had<00:04:16.390> to<00:04:16.570> use<00:04:16.989> the<00:04:17.170> knife

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:17.380 
I don't know why I had to use the knife

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:19.410 
I don't know why I had to use the knife
to<00:04:17.410> kill<00:04:17.799> him<00:04:17.920> the<00:04:18.190> sword<00:04:18.700> I<00:04:18.910> don't<00:04:19.090> know<00:04:19.209> I

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:19.420 
to kill him the sword I don't know I

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:23.640 
to kill him the sword I don't know I
just<00:04:19.570> I<00:04:20.079> had<00:04:20.410> it<00:04:20.590> out<00:04:20.739> it<00:04:21.370> was<00:04:21.579> there<00:04:22.650> alright

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:23.650 
just I had it out it was there alright

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:29.430 
just I had it out it was there alright
so<00:04:24.070> basically<00:04:24.930> I'm<00:04:25.930> gonna<00:04:26.080> try<00:04:26.260> this<00:04:27.510> so<00:04:28.510> I<00:04:28.750> can

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:29.440 
so basically I'm gonna try this so I can

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:32.370 
so basically I'm gonna try this so I can
pretty<00:04:29.800> much<00:04:30.130> stay<00:04:30.580> okay<00:04:31.150> and<00:04:31.930> I'll<00:04:32.020> just<00:04:32.200> let

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:32.380 
pretty much stay okay and I'll just let

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:37.080 
pretty much stay okay and I'll just let
my<00:04:34.080> yeah<00:04:35.080> I<00:04:35.380> just<00:04:35.800> let<00:04:36.070> my<00:04:36.190> saw<00:04:36.400> do<00:04:36.460> the<00:04:36.760> talking

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:37.090 
my yeah I just let my saw do the talking

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:39.690 
my yeah I just let my saw do the talking
help<00:04:37.300> okay<00:04:37.810> it<00:04:37.990> wore<00:04:38.200> off<00:04:38.230> alright<00:04:39.190> well<00:04:39.370> there

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:39.700 
help okay it wore off alright well there

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:41.360 
help okay it wore off alright well there
you<00:04:39.760> go

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:41.370 
you go

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:44.900 
you go
so<00:04:42.370> it<00:04:42.460> doesn't<00:04:42.610> heal<00:04:42.850> nearly<00:04:43.300> as<00:04:43.420> much<00:04:43.600> as<00:04:43.810> the

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:44.910 
so it doesn't heal nearly as much as the

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:48.750 
so it doesn't heal nearly as much as the
the<00:04:45.910> life<00:04:46.150> blade<00:04:46.480> does<00:04:46.780> but<00:04:47.260> or<00:04:47.620> the<00:04:48.190> Life

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:48.760 
the life blade does but or the Life

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:52.530 
the life blade does but or the Life
Drain<00:04:48.790> thing<00:04:49.390> but<00:04:50.320> it<00:04:50.740> still<00:04:51.190> is<00:04:51.550> still<00:04:52.420> pretty

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:52.540 
Drain thing but it still is still pretty

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:57.720 
Drain thing but it still is still pretty
handy<00:04:52.990> to<00:04:53.950> have<00:04:55.080> so<00:04:56.190> it's<00:04:57.190> actually<00:04:57.310> not

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:57.730 
handy to have so it's actually not

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:02.550 
handy to have so it's actually not
terribly<00:04:58.630> expensive<00:04:58.960> like<00:05:00.450> I<00:05:01.450> know<00:05:02.320> that

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:02.560 
terribly expensive like I know that

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:05.520 
terribly expensive like I know that
chest<00:05:02.890> piece<00:05:03.130> is<00:05:03.280> only<00:05:03.400> like<00:05:03.580> 40<00:05:04.240> 42<00:05:04.870> runes<00:05:05.290> or

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:05.530 
chest piece is only like 40 42 runes or

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:10.020 
chest piece is only like 40 42 runes or
mithril<00:05:06.430> whatever<00:05:06.870> so<00:05:07.870> that's<00:05:08.020> not<00:05:08.230> too<00:05:08.440> bad

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:10.030 
mithril whatever so that's not too bad

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:13.020 
mithril whatever so that's not too bad
the<00:05:10.750> shoes<00:05:11.560> I<00:05:11.890> think<00:05:12.220> I<00:05:12.400> think<00:05:12.580> is<00:05:12.669> the<00:05:12.790> shoes

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:13.030 
the shoes I think I think is the shoes

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:15.270 
the shoes I think I think is the shoes
those<00:05:13.390> are<00:05:13.419> like<00:05:13.720> 200<00:05:14.530> so<00:05:14.680> it's<00:05:14.800> a<00:05:14.860> little<00:05:15.010> more

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:15.280 
those are like 200 so it's a little more

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:19.080 
those are like 200 so it's a little more
and<00:05:15.580> then<00:05:16.570> the<00:05:16.690> other<00:05:16.840> two<00:05:17.020> are<00:05:17.080> just<00:05:18.060> are<00:05:19.060> just

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:19.090 
and then the other two are just are just

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:23.540 
and then the other two are just are just
gold<00:05:20.070> so<00:05:21.070> it's<00:05:21.250> not<00:05:21.370> too<00:05:21.580> bad

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:23.550 
gold so it's not too bad

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:26.670 
gold so it's not too bad
it's<00:05:24.550> probably<00:05:25.210> cheaper<00:05:25.240> than<00:05:25.960> the<00:05:26.110> night<00:05:26.350> set

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:26.680 
it's probably cheaper than the night set

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:27.930 
it's probably cheaper than the night set
I<00:05:26.710> think<00:05:26.830> I<00:05:27.100> don't<00:05:27.160> remember<00:05:27.520> how<00:05:27.669> much<00:05:27.790> the

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:27.940 
I think I don't remember how much the

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:30.300 
I think I don't remember how much the
night<00:05:28.090> set<00:05:28.360> was<00:05:28.540> I<00:05:28.720> I<00:05:29.380> honestly<00:05:29.770> don't<00:05:29.980> but

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:30.310 
night set was I I honestly don't but

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:35.600 
night set was I I honestly don't but
it's<00:05:31.270> pretty<00:05:31.900> good<00:05:32.110> for<00:05:32.950> the<00:05:33.070> for<00:05:33.669> all<00:05:34.180> that

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:35.610 
it's pretty good for the for all that

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:39.960 
it's pretty good for the for all that
the<00:05:36.610> health<00:05:36.790> you<00:05:36.970> have<00:05:37.120> is<00:05:37.330> is<00:05:37.600> just<00:05:38.380> a<00:05:38.970> smidge

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:39.970 
the health you have is is just a smidge

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:41.640 
the health you have is is just a smidge
under<00:05:40.300> what<00:05:40.660> you<00:05:40.780> would<00:05:40.930> get<00:05:41.080> with<00:05:41.260> the<00:05:41.440> night

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:41.650 
under what you would get with the night

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:44.700 
under what you would get with the night
set<00:05:41.979> I<00:05:42.010> believe<00:05:42.490> it's<00:05:42.850> like<00:05:43.050> two<00:05:44.050> hundred<00:05:44.260> or

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:44.710 
set I believe it's like two hundred or

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:46.590 
set I believe it's like two hundred or
two<00:05:45.040> thousand<00:05:45.669> or<00:05:45.760> two<00:05:46.030> or<00:05:46.180> two<00:05:46.330> or<00:05:46.419> three

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:46.600 
two thousand or two or two or three

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:50.040 
two thousand or two or two or three
thousand<00:05:47.080> let's<00:05:47.740> see

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:50.050 

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:53.430 

just<00:05:50.800> a<00:05:51.009> little<00:05:51.190> bit<00:05:51.430> less<00:05:51.840> but<00:05:52.840> I<00:05:52.900> think<00:05:53.229> the

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:53.440 
just a little bit less but I think the

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:56.399 
just a little bit less but I think the
the<00:05:53.919> suit<00:05:54.159> bonus<00:05:54.520> more<00:05:55.509> than<00:05:55.720> makes<00:05:55.900> up<00:05:56.080> for<00:05:56.139> it

00:05:56.399 --> 00:05:56.409 
the suit bonus more than makes up for it

00:05:56.409 --> 00:05:59.129 
the suit bonus more than makes up for it
yeah<00:05:56.560> it's<00:05:56.770> 3000<00:05:57.430> less<00:05:57.550> and<00:05:58.150> but<00:05:58.509> you<00:05:58.659> do<00:05:58.810> you

00:05:59.129 --> 00:05:59.139 
yeah it's 3000 less and but you do you

00:05:59.139 --> 00:06:04.249 
yeah it's 3000 less and but you do you
do<00:05:59.289> go<00:05:59.500> one<00:05:59.770> speed<00:05:59.979> faster<00:06:00.699> so<00:06:01.349> there's<00:06:02.349> that

00:06:04.249 --> 00:06:04.259 
do go one speed faster so there's that

00:06:04.259 --> 00:06:05.909 
do go one speed faster so there's that
nothing<00:06:05.259> that's<00:06:05.379> pretty<00:06:05.530> cool

00:06:05.909 --> 00:06:05.919 
nothing that's pretty cool

00:06:05.919 --> 00:06:09.420 
nothing that's pretty cool
