need to look for when you're looking at

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.040 
need to look for when you're looking at
primal<00:00:27.060> cane<00:00:27.210> fruiting<00:00:27.570> or<00:00:27.660> everbearing

primal cane fruiting or everbearing

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.349 
primal cane fruiting or everbearing
varieties<00:00:28.590> is<00:00:28.740> maturity<00:00:29.400> date<00:00:29.609> because<00:00:30.000> most

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
varieties is maturity date because most

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:31.910 
varieties is maturity date because most
of<00:00:30.570> the<00:00:30.689> everbearing<00:00:31.080> varieties<00:00:31.619> won't

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
of the everbearing varieties won't

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.920 
of the everbearing varieties won't
mature<00:00:32.279> in<00:00:32.399> time<00:00:32.640> won't<00:00:33.000> ripen<00:00:33.270> that<00:00:33.600> fall

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
mature in time won't ripen that fall

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.200 
mature in time won't ripen that fall
crop<00:00:34.260> in<00:00:34.469> time<00:00:34.980> for<00:00:35.219> you<00:00:35.309> to<00:00:35.460> pick<00:00:35.610> a<00:00:35.670> good<00:00:35.880> crop

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
crop in time for you to pick a good crop

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.540 
crop in time for you to pick a good crop
so<00:00:36.809> you<00:00:36.870> need<00:00:37.050> to<00:00:37.140> look<00:00:37.230> for<00:00:37.290> early<00:00:37.860> maturing

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
so you need to look for early maturing

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.000 
so you need to look for early maturing
everbearing<00:00:39.390> type<00:00:39.750> raspberries<00:00:40.440> and<00:00:40.559> that

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
everbearing type raspberries and that

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.430 
everbearing type raspberries and that
really<00:00:41.520> limits<00:00:41.760> our<00:00:42.059> selection<00:00:42.629> here<00:00:42.960> what

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
really limits our selection here what

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.319 
really limits our selection here what
I've<00:00:43.559> got<00:00:43.739> is<00:00:43.920> some<00:00:44.550> of<00:00:44.670> them<00:00:44.789> here<00:00:45.120> I<00:00:45.149> don't

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
I've got is some of them here I don't

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:46.670 
I've got is some of them here I don't
have<00:00:45.570> all<00:00:45.899> of<00:00:45.930> the<00:00:46.170> ones<00:00:46.350> that<00:00:46.530> I<00:00:46.559> would

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
have all of the ones that I would

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.170 
have all of the ones that I would
recommend<00:00:47.070> for<00:00:47.399> this<00:00:47.520> area<00:00:47.700> but<00:00:47.850> these<00:00:48.030> are

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
recommend for this area but these are

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.250 
recommend for this area but these are
some<00:00:48.300> of<00:00:48.329> the<00:00:48.480> newer<00:00:48.660> ones<00:00:48.750> that<00:00:49.140> you<00:00:49.230> should

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
some of the newer ones that you should

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.260 
some of the newer ones that you should
be<00:00:49.469> taking<00:00:49.860> a<00:00:49.920> look<00:00:50.129> at<00:00:50.340> that<00:00:50.610> mature<00:00:50.969> of<00:00:51.090> nice

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
be taking a look at that mature of nice

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.479 
be taking a look at that mature of nice
and<00:00:51.480> early<00:00:51.750> for<00:00:51.960> us<00:00:51.989> first<00:00:52.890> on<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.190> list<00:00:53.309> is

and early for us first on the list is

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.430 
and early for us first on the list is
Polana<00:00:53.910> this<00:00:54.239> is<00:00:54.360> a<00:00:54.390> variety<00:00:54.660> from<00:00:54.840> Poland

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
Polana this is a variety from Poland

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:56.840 
Polana this is a variety from Poland
that's<00:00:55.590> actually<00:00:55.890> been<00:00:56.100> with<00:00:56.309> us<00:00:56.340> for<00:00:56.640> quite<00:00:56.820> a

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
that's actually been with us for quite a

that's actually been with us for quite a
while<00:00:57.149> Paul<00:00:58.079> Polana<00:00:58.710> is<00:00:58.949> bred<00:00:59.789> from<00:01:00.059> good

heritage<00:01:02.640> which<00:01:02.820> is<00:01:02.940> one<00:01:03.090> of<00:01:03.120> the<00:01:03.239> better

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
heritage which is one of the better

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.299 
heritage which is one of the better
everbearing<00:01:04.350> varieties<00:01:04.860> we<00:01:04.979> have<00:01:05.010> but

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
everbearing varieties we have but

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.250 
everbearing varieties we have but
unfortunately<00:01:05.400> it's<00:01:06.150> too<00:01:06.330> late<00:01:06.540> for<00:01:06.869> most<00:01:06.990> of

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
unfortunately it's too late for most of

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.539 
unfortunately it's too late for most of
Maine<00:01:07.439> unless<00:01:07.710> you're<00:01:07.860> in<00:01:07.920> most<00:01:08.340> southern

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
Maine unless you're in most southern

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.070 
Maine unless you're in most southern
Maine<00:01:08.820> I<00:01:08.850> wouldn't<00:01:09.210> recommend<00:01:09.450> heritage

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
Maine I wouldn't recommend heritage

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.500 
Maine I wouldn't recommend heritage
Portland<00:01:10.619> and<00:01:10.680> South<00:01:10.890> yes<00:01:11.250> but<00:01:11.850> Polana<00:01:12.240> is

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
Portland and South yes but Polana is

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.270 
Portland and South yes but Polana is
considerably<00:01:13.080> earlier<00:01:13.260> than<00:01:13.619> heritage<00:01:14.040> about

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
considerably earlier than heritage about

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.190 
considerably earlier than heritage about
two<00:01:14.520> weeks<00:01:14.729> earlier<00:01:15.090> that<00:01:15.630> means<00:01:15.840> that<00:01:16.049> it's

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
two weeks earlier that means that it's

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.749 
two weeks earlier that means that it's
going<00:01:16.320> to<00:01:16.380> start<00:01:16.560> ripening<00:01:17.009> about<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.460> fourth

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
going to start ripening about the fourth

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.280 
going to start ripening about the fourth
week<00:01:18.000> of<00:01:18.119> August<00:01:18.509> third<00:01:18.689> or<00:01:18.840> fourth<00:01:19.020> week<00:01:19.170> of

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
week of August third or fourth week of

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.260 
week of August third or fourth week of
August<00:01:19.680> depending<00:01:20.070> on<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:20.280> year<00:01:20.490> as<00:01:20.670> you<00:01:21.150> can

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
August depending on the year as you can

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:22.789 
August depending on the year as you can
see<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:21.630> fruit<00:01:21.810> size<00:01:21.990> is<00:01:22.200> a<00:01:22.259> little<00:01:22.290> bit<00:01:22.530> small

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
see the fruit size is a little bit small

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.380 
see the fruit size is a little bit small
this<00:01:22.920> is<00:01:23.070> actually<00:01:23.369> the<00:01:23.490> summer<00:01:23.729> crop<00:01:24.060> on<00:01:24.240> this

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
this is actually the summer crop on this

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:25.940 
this is actually the summer crop on this
one<00:01:24.600> so<00:01:24.750> I'm<00:01:24.869> not<00:01:24.900> seeing<00:01:25.290> as<00:01:25.409> much<00:01:25.560> potential

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
one so I'm not seeing as much potential

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.859 
one so I'm not seeing as much potential
as<00:01:26.130> we<00:01:26.280> could<00:01:26.520> but<00:01:27.090> it's<00:01:27.210> a<00:01:27.270> little<00:01:27.420> bit<00:01:27.600> small

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
as we could but it's a little bit small

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.440 
as we could but it's a little bit small
it<00:01:28.290> has<00:01:28.530> good<00:01:28.829> color<00:01:29.070> flavor<00:01:29.670> I<00:01:29.850> would<00:01:30.119> rate<00:01:30.270> is

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
it has good color flavor I would rate is

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.660 
it has good color flavor I would rate is
only<00:01:30.630> fair<00:01:31.110> but<00:01:31.409> at<00:01:31.619> that<00:01:32.009> time<00:01:32.070> of<00:01:32.400> year<00:01:32.430> it's

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
only fair but at that time of year it's

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.249 
only fair but at that time of year it's
probably<00:01:33.030> the<00:01:33.119> only<00:01:33.270> raspberry<00:01:33.780> in<00:01:33.869> town<00:01:34.079> so

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
probably the only raspberry in town so

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:35.330 
probably the only raspberry in town so
you're<00:01:34.409> not<00:01:34.500> going<00:01:34.650> to<00:01:34.740> get<00:01:34.890> many<00:01:35.040> arguments

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
you're not going to get many arguments

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:36.710 
you're not going to get many arguments
about<00:01:35.610> it<00:01:35.850> it<00:01:35.939> still<00:01:36.150> has<00:01:36.270> a<00:01:36.299> pretty<00:01:36.479> good
