but it's still yeah I don't know maybe

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:55.080 
but it's still yeah I don't know maybe
not<00:03:53.920> the<00:03:54.070> best<00:03:54.100> choice<00:03:54.310> but<00:03:54.610> at<00:03:54.700> least<00:03:54.790> it's<00:03:55.000> a

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.090 
not the best choice but at least it's a

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:57.720 
not the best choice but at least it's a
step<00:03:55.270> in<00:03:55.390> the<00:03:55.450> right<00:03:55.600> direction<00:03:55.800> that<00:03:56.800> is<00:03:57.160> all

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:57.730 
step in the right direction that is all

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:01.560 
step in the right direction that is all
I<00:03:57.760> have<00:03:57.970> to<00:03:58.090> say<00:03:58.120> on<00:03:58.300> that<00:03:58.330> subject<00:03:58.450> take<00:03:59.350> care
