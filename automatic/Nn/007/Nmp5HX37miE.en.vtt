 You are the one of this number series of Yamaha this one was made for the concert of Maa 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:45.790
 The frame is a very sturdy piano and it is like Kano as a whole.

 It is a piano with hidden piano power to do great power 

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:54.970
 And the manufacturer that this Diapason is Well to say that well as a neutral sound of that name that 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:04:00.250
 Playing 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:04:04.810
 A piano is a neutral position in the sense that it brings out the power of that piano 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:11.200
 It seems what that Tagged name in such form 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:14.960
 And still I mean very well that traditional sound as well as a sound way as a whole that 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:19.220
 Kind of made of wood that had been made with the aim of Europe of the piano 

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:24.470
