00:00:10.409 --> 00:00:15.779
 despite what a Lenten theme presented that the subject of fasting and 

00:00:15.779 --> 00:00:17.140
 abstinence 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:20.449
 known mostly and badly called as a wake 

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:26.479
 is that on Fridays you should not eat meat this is called abstinence from 

00:00:26.479 --> 00:00:27.449
 meats 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:28.710
 but also 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.829
 Ash Wednesday on Good Friday 

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:33.610
 is about 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:35.120
 one there 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.430
 what is fasting 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:40.850
 because we find in the proposal of fasting practically in all 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.160
 religions also clear in the catholic church as an observance 

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:48.730
 and what is the abstinence of meat 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:51.730
 this is the explanation 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:58.150
 the liturgical season of Lent is a time that is opportune for 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:00.370
 live the practice of penance 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:05.000
 so it really should be for all believers in Christ a 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.890
 time of authentic conversion and intense knowledge of the mystery 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:10.320
 Christian 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.370
 It is a desert time that pushes loneliness to aridity where there is no water 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:18.180
 nor food where there is nothing 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.240
 but from where the creator who loves his creature to hold a meeting in 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.380
 the one who is aware of loneliness 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.530
 that then invade with his near and divine presence 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.010
 breaking the ice of the encounter between the human children 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:33.979
 the penitential attitude of the believer 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:38.969
 is expressed through the practice of fasting and the relevance of prayer and 

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:39.910
 alms 

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:43.790
 fasting and abstinence express conversion in relation to oneself 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:48.660
 moderates the seasons dissipates the temptations strengthens the will 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:52.320
 allows us to acquire control over our instincts 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.200
 and conquer freedom of heart 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.270
 the prayer expresses the conversion in relation to god the human being is the 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.200
 only creature that has capacity 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.290
 and this the prayer how I got in touch with him 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.970
 with words but also with listening 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:13.099
 because God speaks quietly to the heart 

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:17.549
 after yesterday you can listen to him and know how much he has to say to give 

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:21.439
 to know the alms expresses the conversion in relation to others 

00:02:21.439 --> 00:02:26.519
 the communion of goods the act of sharing allows one to leave oneself 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:28.419
 to meet others 

00:02:28.419 --> 00:02:29.859
 and enter subject 

00:02:29.859 --> 00:02:33.579
 know their dreams their aspirations their ideals in their shortcomings 

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:38.359
 the detachment of one's own allows sharing and being supportive 

00:02:38.359 --> 00:02:39.739
 because solidarity 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:41.590
 more than worrying about the other 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:44.590
 is to take responsibility for 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:49.500
 remembering that Jesus Christ spent 40 days in the desert the believers 

00:02:49.499 --> 00:02:52.509
 we try to imitate what to be like him 

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:57.369
 it's about presenting ourselves to the Lord during this Lent with an effort 

00:02:57.369 --> 00:03:02.339
 by removing our defects to be better people and being closer to
