00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:42.440 
that I bought maybe a year and a half

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:45.400 
that I bought maybe a year and a half
ago<00:03:42.709> and<00:03:43.160> it<00:03:43.880> is<00:03:44.030> this<00:03:44.269> jean<00:03:44.810> jacket<00:03:45.230> that<00:03:45.380> I

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:45.410 
ago and it is this jean jacket that I

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:47.770 
ago and it is this jean jacket that I
got<00:03:45.620> from<00:03:45.830> brandy<00:03:46.550> it's<00:03:46.910> one<00:03:47.540> of<00:03:47.630> those

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:51.830 
oversized ones and I just I think at the

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:54.400 
oversized ones and I just I think at the
time<00:03:52.100> because<00:03:52.459> I<00:03:52.519> was<00:03:52.730> pregnant<00:03:53.000> I<00:03:53.540> felt<00:03:54.260> like

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:54.410 
time because I was pregnant I felt like

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:55.960 
time because I was pregnant I felt like
I<00:03:54.530> should<00:03:54.739> be<00:03:54.860> wearing<00:03:55.040> something<00:03:55.370> that<00:03:55.700> will

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:12.820 
would probably be the biggest waste of

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:16.470 
would probably be the biggest waste of
money<00:04:12.910> that<00:04:13.150> I've<00:04:13.270> had<00:04:15.210> okay<00:04:16.210> this<00:04:16.390> question
