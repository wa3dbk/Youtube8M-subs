00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:20.300
 Hello everyone, today we will realize together 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:22.640
 a recipe much loved by children but 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:25.160
 also and especially by adults 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:27.560
 this time, however, in a version a little more 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:31.189
 light compared to the original 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:31.939
 it is the marvelous salami of 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:35.629
 chocolate 

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:37.670
 this time I will make it without eggs 

00:00:35.629 --> 00:00:40.309
 and without butter 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:42.440
 so it's a version we say that 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:43.879
 contains less fat than that 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.830
 original 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:49.430
 a very sweet dessert any occasion 

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:52.339
 and above all very suitable also for those 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:55.879
 little parties where there are so many 

00:00:52.339 --> 00:01:01.670
 children then to make it there 

00:00:55.879 --> 00:01:03.409
 it will take 250 g of biscuits or buckets 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:08.000
 or as I did 

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:10.130
 I say these with hazelnut 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.159
 because I want to make just the 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:16.130
 version with hazelnut roma with 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:21.200
 hazelnut flavors then 250 g of 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:24.170
 hazelnut biscuits 40 grams of 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:27.469
 walnut kernels which we will then go to 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:29.570
 chop not too not too much 

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:36.229
 finely and then a little 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:38.990
 coarse 150 grams of chocolate ai 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:43.999
 then hazelnut and 50 gram hazelnuts 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:51.950
 of extra dark chocolate 4 tbsp 

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:54.969
 of rice milk 2 tablespoons of rum 2 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.969
 spoons of honey 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:02:00.799
 I use this ambrosoli while like 

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:03.770
 tools we will need a little 

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:05.049
 kick in the oven a bit of paper 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:07.939
 aluminum 

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:10.459
 I was a bowl to mix ours 

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:11.030
 more ingredients we will need a mixer 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:14.180
 for 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:16.459
 chopping our wedding our nuts is 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.920
 a saucepan to melt the 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:21.050
 our chocolate 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:25.040
 now let's get it ready first 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:29.060
 what are we going to dissolve in a 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:31.209
 small pan in our chocolate if 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.860
 you can also choose it 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:35.270
 inside the microwave or a 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:39.010
 bain-marie 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:39.010
 I use a non-stick saucepan 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:42.819
 we mix well 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:48.190
 we also add rice milk 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:56.050
 we turn off the heat and add also the 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:56.050
 two tablespoons of rum 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:03.500
 meanwhile that our chocolate 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:07.940
 we will be intimidated so we put it 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:09.680
 on the one hand and we are going to prepare the 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:12.680
 our cookies 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:16.670
 I've already put them in 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:20.440
 we are going to crush this bag 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:20.440
 with cody hands 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:42.640
 in order to create crumbs of 

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:42.640
 so small this way 

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:54.100
 so let's go all the cookies 

00:03:55.210 --> 00:04:18.459
 add the melted chocolate 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:18.459
 previously we mix well 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:28.870
 we also add the two tablespoons of 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:28.870
 honey 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:49.690
 Milan 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:34.790
 we transfer everything onto the card from 

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:38.990
 oven and roll the ball all over the 

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:54.620
 the rest remains that date today 

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:58.040
 feature report we transfer the 

00:05:54.620 --> 00:06:00.130
 all over a sheet of paper by 

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:00.130
 aluminum 

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:38.850
 we transfer it to the fridge we leave it 

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:41.730
 rest at least five to six hours 

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:44.430
 I would also recommend all night and 

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:47.070
 then you can cut it and enjoy it 

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:51.060
 then I will leave you anyway 

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:54.270
 related photos once it will be 

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:55.890
 I hope this is all ready 

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:58.950

00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:05.690
 in this version of it turns out too much 

00:07:01.890 --> 00:07:11.010
 I assure you that light will be 

00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:12.780
 luscious, however, I send a kiss to 

00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:14.970
