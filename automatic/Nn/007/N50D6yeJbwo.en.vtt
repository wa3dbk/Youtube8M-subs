00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 hello friends from the garden of jose here 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:07.259
 we are again and today I am going to make a 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.639
 new video of planting vegetables in the 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:10.500
 greenhouse 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:13.769
 how do I have the vegetable inside the 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.420
 greenhouse but before entering inside 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.119
 I'm going to show you a greenhouse 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.640
 which I already said when I made the video of 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:23.400
 greenhouse construction the purpose 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:32.489
 that had the mosquito netting surrounding 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:34.880
 all the greenhouse and good that 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:37.320
 purpose of the raised 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:38.030
 rolled on both long sides of the 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.620
 greenhouse 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:43.800
 the plastic to the top one 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.420
 height above 180 and practically inside 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:50.039
 of the greenhouse there is the same temperature 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:51.780
 that's what that's about, what if 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.730
 it has four windows that it passes that 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.309
 inside when it's very sunny and makes 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.989
 heat the temperature goes up a lot but 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.329
 with this I got to have inside a 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.940
 very good temperature and that was the 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:05.280
 purpose in your day when you explain what 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.220
 of the mosquito net fabric, well 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:11.990
 explained let's go inside the greenhouse 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:15.000
 I will show you how I have the plants 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:19.280
 truth is that they are impressive 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:22.960
 we are entering good good here you have 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:27.320
 how is the greenhouse 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:30.140
 here you have it is everything already super big 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:32.980
 reflects if you are this is the second 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:35.050
 day since planted 

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:36.540
 I've already caught about forty or 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:39.330
 fifty lettuces 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:42.180
 here you have tomato tomatoes 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:46.190
 they are super big 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:50.060
 will give you a ride and you see it 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:52.910
 and plagued with tomatoes as you see they are 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.830
 are plagued with tomatoes are already 

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:55.940
 reaching almost the maximum height because 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:57.500
 after finding him cut in the 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:00.220
 tips because I do not want them to grow more 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.220
 here you see it 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:05.840
 since the lettuces so impressive 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:11.360
 and then the onions 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.460
 the onions are also very very 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:16.800
 big 

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:19.170
 good here you have 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.790
 the tomatoes 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.790
 and here inside right now there is a 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:26.250
 temperature of 25 degrees if it was not 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:29.580
 in this open would have easy easy to what 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:32.020
 better 35 and it's in the afternoon already the 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:35.020
 six and ten in the afternoon 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:37.510
 here you have everything 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:41.260
 another review and the peppers here the 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:42.880
 you have paprika with your flower already 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.170
 puntito peppers and leaving the 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:45.730
 true that it costs more than tomatoes 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:48.480
 but in them it gives 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.480
 Here you have 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:56.220
 and having the tomatoes the truth is that 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:58.940
 Tomatoes are very large and with 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.940
 many tomatoes 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:05.049
 and those of nose 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:06.489
 all already with their tomatitos here the 

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:08.510
 strawberries that the truth that I have eaten a 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:11.470
 heap 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:11.470
 here is the proof 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:16.939
 and the peteneras the pepineros the 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:18.109
 first to plant them has started 

00:03:16.939 --> 00:03:19.340
 because the truth that did not work 

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:23.769
 very well I want to fly alone returned to 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:23.769
 plant and have about 10 days 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:30.000
 good cucumbers 

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:32.750
 I do not want to do it much longer 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.670
 here is the temperature 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:36.350
 if it were not because it is open with 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:38.240
 side as I said before the 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:39.650
 plastic here you could not be of the 

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:42.640
 heat wanted 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:46.660
 and here you have 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:49.150
 the lettuces are small that the week 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:52.230
 last and now that it's hot the truth 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:52.230
 is that in four days 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:57.880
 here you have another appropriate for the 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:59.970
 another one turned around here so you can see how 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:02.270
 that's all 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:04.850
 and nothing 

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:08.350
 here I have taught you again and the 

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:10.090
 fifth part of greenhouse 

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:11.920
 planting vegetables 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:15.100
 greenhouse I hope you liked it 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:18.790
 If you liked it, you give a good 

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:20.830
 that has not subscribed to the channel because if 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:25.510
 she wants it and she wants to write 

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:28.500
 the truth is that we are already 142 I am 

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:28.500
 very happy 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:36.070
 the channel is getting the truth a lot 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:36.070
 success for me one pass 

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:43.469
 and nothing here I leave you 

00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:46.219
 with a panoramic track of everything that 

00:04:43.469 --> 00:04:46.219
 it's the greenhouse 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:51.720
 and you have nothing until the next one 

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:54.230
 greeting 

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:54.230
