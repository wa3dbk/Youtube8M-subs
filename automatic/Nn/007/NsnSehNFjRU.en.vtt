00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:48.850 
something that I really was hypnotized

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:51.540 
something that I really was hypnotized
by<00:01:49.090> how<00:01:49.869> the<00:01:50.440> landscape<00:01:50.800> and<00:01:51.310> the<00:01:51.369> world

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:51.550 
by how the landscape and the world

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:53.700 
by how the landscape and the world
around<00:01:51.820> us<00:01:52.060> is<00:01:52.300> never<00:01:52.540> really<00:01:52.840> finished<00:01:53.409> and

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:53.710 
around us is never really finished and

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:55.800 
around us is never really finished and
it's<00:01:54.280> always<00:01:54.610> in<00:01:54.790> this<00:01:54.909> state<00:01:55.210> of<00:01:55.240> becoming

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:55.810 
it's always in this state of becoming

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:57.899 
it's always in this state of becoming
which<00:01:56.680> is<00:01:56.830> something<00:01:57.070> that<00:01:57.220> I<00:01:57.369> really<00:01:57.640> like<00:01:57.790> to

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:57.909 
which is something that I really like to

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:00.150

that's<00:02:11.920> already<00:02:12.459> grown<00:02:12.820> up<00:02:12.850> and<00:02:13.269> it's<00:02:14.019> already

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
that's already grown up and it's already

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.680 
that's already grown up and it's already
kind<00:02:14.650> of<00:02:14.769> reached<00:02:15.459> its<00:02:15.730> crescendo<00:02:16.360> or<00:02:16.570> its

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
kind of reached its crescendo or its

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:18.780 
kind of reached its crescendo or its
peak<00:02:17.019> where<00:02:17.560> do<00:02:17.650> you<00:02:17.739> go<00:02:17.950> from<00:02:18.130> there<00:02:18.400> if

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
peak where do you go from there if

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.090 
peak where do you go from there if
you're<00:02:19.239> just<00:02:19.269> coming<00:02:19.840> up<00:02:20.170> how<00:02:20.680> do<00:02:20.739> you<00:02:20.890> get

anybody<00:04:17.910> or<00:04:18.180> anything<00:04:18.480> so<00:04:18.870> it<00:04:19.380> still<00:04:19.650> always

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:19.859 
anybody or anything so it still always

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:21.979 
anybody or anything so it still always
goes<00:04:20.160> back<00:04:20.430> to<00:04:20.609> the<00:04:20.760> community<00:04:21.510> type<00:04:21.750> thing

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:21.989 
goes back to the community type thing

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:23.180 
goes back to the community type thing
and<00:04:22.320> I<00:04:22.530> think<00:04:22.590> that's<00:04:22.860> what's<00:04:23.130> really

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
and I think that's what's really

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:25.370 
and I think that's what's really
separating<00:04:23.970> everything<00:04:24.200> recently<00:04:25.200> like

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:25.380 
separating everything recently like

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:29.090 
separating everything recently like
street<00:04:25.680> art<00:04:25.860> has<00:04:26.100> become<00:04:26.760> a<00:04:26.970> big<00:04:27.660> part<00:04:28.200> of<00:04:28.380> like

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:29.100 
street art has become a big part of like

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:31.580 
street art has become a big part of like

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:32.970 
the Beltline that pops up you have

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:35.060 
the Beltline that pops up you have
living<00:04:33.210> whoa<00:04:33.390> it's<00:04:33.780> doing<00:04:34.020> the<00:04:34.140> murals<00:04:34.560> you
