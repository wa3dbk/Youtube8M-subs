tribe headon asked if let's see what was

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.700 
tribe headon asked if let's see what was
the<00:00:36.360> title<00:00:36.630> of<00:00:36.899> his<00:00:37.079> question<00:00:37.700> was<00:00:39.710> using

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
the title of his question was using

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.450 
the title of his question was using
forest<00:00:41.190> soil<00:00:41.520> to<00:00:41.850> inoculate<00:00:42.170> compost<00:00:43.170> and<00:00:43.530> so

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
forest soil to inoculate compost and so

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.160 
forest soil to inoculate compost and so
what<00:00:44.640> Hayden<00:00:44.940> likes<00:00:45.120> to<00:00:45.300> do<00:00:45.480> is<00:00:45.629> take<00:00:45.840> a<00:00:45.870> couple

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
what Hayden likes to do is take a couple

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.760 
what Hayden likes to do is take a couple
buckets<00:00:46.680> of<00:00:46.890> forest<00:00:47.489> soil<00:00:47.789> and<00:00:48.410> put<00:00:49.410> it<00:00:49.500> into

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
buckets of forest soil and put it into

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.369 
buckets of forest soil and put it into
his<00:00:49.890> compost<00:00:50.370> prior<00:00:51.180> to<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:51.780> composting

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
his compost prior to the composting

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.090 
his compost prior to the composting
process<00:00:52.699> so<00:00:53.699> and<00:00:54.239> he<00:00:54.390> says<00:00:54.600> here<00:00:54.840> that<00:00:54.870> his<00:00:55.230> his

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
process so and he says here that his his

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.189 
process so and he says here that his his
compost<00:00:56.460> is<00:00:56.610> about<00:00:56.820> two<00:00:57.000> cubic<00:00:57.480> meters<00:00:57.809> so

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
compost is about two cubic meters so

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.310 
compost is about two cubic meters so
it's<00:00:58.350> a<00:00:58.440> decent-sized<00:00:58.980> compost<00:00:59.609> and<00:01:00.109> he<00:01:01.109> likes

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
it's a decent-sized compost and he likes

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.799 
it's a decent-sized compost and he likes
to<00:01:01.440> heat<00:01:01.590> it<00:01:01.739> up<00:01:01.829> to<00:01:01.890> about<00:01:02.250> 55<00:01:02.879> 65<00:01:03.329> degrees

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
to heat it up to about 55 65 degrees

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.289 
to heat it up to about 55 65 degrees
Celsius<00:01:04.409> which<00:01:05.189> converts<00:01:05.729> over<00:01:05.909> to

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
Celsius which converts over to

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.490 
Celsius which converts over to
approximately<00:01:07.140> 130<00:01:07.710> or<00:01:07.920> 150<00:01:08.549> Fahrenheit<00:01:09.180> and

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:09.500 
approximately 130 or 150 Fahrenheit and

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.230 
approximately 130 or 150 Fahrenheit and
his<00:01:10.500> question<00:01:10.979> was<00:01:11.189> is<00:01:11.549> if<00:01:12.030> he<00:01:12.210> takes

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
his question was is if he takes

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.560 
his question was is if he takes
something<00:01:12.840> from<00:01:13.260> like<00:01:13.680> forest<00:01:14.159> soil<00:01:14.540> which<00:01:15.540> is

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
something from like forest soil which is

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.230 
something from like forest soil which is
fungal<00:01:16.110> dominated<00:01:16.290> and<00:01:16.920> puts<00:01:17.670> that<00:01:17.820> into<00:01:18.119> his

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
fungal dominated and puts that into his

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.570 
fungal dominated and puts that into his
compost<00:01:18.780> runs<00:01:19.470> it<00:01:19.650> through<00:01:19.830> the<00:01:19.950> composting

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
compost runs it through the composting

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.719 
compost runs it through the composting
process<00:01:21.619> where<00:01:22.619> it<00:01:22.770> heats<00:01:22.950> up<00:01:23.220> to<00:01:23.280> these<00:01:23.520> high

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
process where it heats up to these high

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.270 
process where it heats up to these high
temperatures<00:01:24.320> will<00:01:25.320> he<00:01:25.530> be<00:01:25.680> killing<00:01:26.040> all<00:01:26.189> the

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
temperatures will he be killing all the

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.289 
temperatures will he be killing all the
mice<00:01:26.430> to<00:01:26.610> do<00:01:26.820> the<00:01:27.060> fungal<00:01:27.420> mycelium<00:01:27.570> and<00:01:28.850> if<00:01:29.850> he

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
mice to do the fungal mycelium and if he

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.300 
mice to do the fungal mycelium and if he
does<00:01:30.540> if<00:01:30.720> it<00:01:30.840> is<00:01:31.020> killing<00:01:31.290> my<00:01:31.470> cilia<00:01:31.829> are<00:01:32.070> there

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
does if it is killing my cilia are there

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.270 
does if it is killing my cilia are there
spores<00:01:32.820> in<00:01:33.180> that<00:01:33.869> soil<00:01:34.229> that<00:01:34.590> will<00:01:34.829> be<00:01:34.950> able<00:01:35.070> to

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
spores in that soil that will be able to

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.649 
spores in that soil that will be able to
survive<00:01:35.640> and<00:01:35.939> tolerate<00:01:36.360> those<00:01:36.479> high

survive and tolerate those high

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.770 
survive and tolerate those high
temperatures<00:01:37.049> and<00:01:37.500> then<00:01:38.240> Willie<00:01:39.240> result

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
temperatures and then Willie result

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.780 
temperatures and then Willie result
basically<00:01:40.650> in<00:01:40.799> a<00:01:40.890> more<00:01:41.130> fungal<00:01:41.610> dominated

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
basically in a more fungal dominated

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.039 
basically in a more fungal dominated
compost<00:01:42.380> by<00:01:43.380> doing<00:01:43.740> this<00:01:44.360> so<00:01:45.360> what<00:01:45.899> I<00:01:45.930> did

video and I put this question to Dan and
what<00:02:03.899> he<00:02:04.049> did<00:02:04.259> is<00:02:04.439> he<00:02:04.619> actually<00:02:04.649> put

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
what he did is he actually put

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.340 
what he did is he actually put
over<00:02:05.549> and<00:02:05.700> turned<00:02:05.909> it<00:02:06.030> to<00:02:06.210> his<00:02:06.539> one<00:02:07.200> of<00:02:07.229> his

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
over and turned it to his one of his

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:12.860 
over and turned it to his one of his
senior<00:02:07.799> oil<00:02:08.250> biologist<00:02:09.140> David<00:02:10.140> and<00:02:11.510> and<00:02:12.510> what

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
senior oil biologist David and and what

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.770 
senior oil biologist David and and what
David<00:02:13.110> said<00:02:13.620> was<00:02:14.510> essentially<00:02:15.510> what<00:02:15.660> you're

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
David said was essentially what you're

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.170 
David said was essentially what you're
doing<00:02:16.050> is<00:02:16.170> you're<00:02:16.319> taking<00:02:16.910> and<00:02:17.910> it<00:02:18.000> makes

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
doing is you're taking and it makes

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.570 
doing is you're taking and it makes
common<00:02:18.390> sense<00:02:18.569> there<00:02:19.349> it's<00:02:19.769> common<00:02:20.129> sense<00:02:20.160> in

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
common sense there it's common sense in

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.850 
common sense there it's common sense in
that<00:02:20.730> you're<00:02:21.150> taking<00:02:21.450> soil<00:02:21.720> from<00:02:22.049> a<00:02:22.349> specific

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
that you're taking soil from a specific

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:24.860 
that you're taking soil from a specific
environment<00:02:23.489> that's<00:02:23.700> adapted<00:02:24.239> to<00:02:24.360> a<00:02:24.390> specific

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
environment that's adapted to a specific

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.330 
environment that's adapted to a specific
environment<00:02:25.140> evolved<00:02:25.890> in<00:02:25.980> a<00:02:26.040> certain

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
environment evolved in a certain

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.640 
environment evolved in a certain
environment<00:02:26.540> like<00:02:27.540> the<00:02:27.720> forest<00:02:28.110> soil<00:02:28.379> and

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
environment like the forest soil and

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.170 
environment like the forest soil and
you're<00:02:29.069> taking<00:02:29.400> it<00:02:29.489> and<00:02:29.580> you're<00:02:29.700> throwing<00:02:29.970> it

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
you're taking it and you're throwing it

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.449 
you're taking it and you're throwing it
into<00:02:30.299> something<00:02:30.599> a<00:02:31.310> completely<00:02:32.310> different

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
into something a completely different

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:34.460 
into something a completely different
environment<00:02:32.760> and<00:02:33.330> you're<00:02:33.420> heating<00:02:33.690> it<00:02:33.780> up<00:02:33.900> so

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
environment and you're heating it up so

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.259 
environment and you're heating it up so
yes<00:02:34.709> in<00:02:35.099> the<00:02:35.250> end<00:02:35.280> unfortunately<00:02:35.760> you<00:02:36.180> are

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:36.269 
yes in the end unfortunately you are

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:38.690 
yes in the end unfortunately you are
gonna<00:02:36.510> kill<00:02:36.810> a<00:02:36.840> lot<00:02:37.080> of<00:02:37.200> my<00:02:37.319> cilia<00:02:37.680> are<00:02:38.250> any<00:02:38.549> of

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
gonna kill a lot of my cilia are any of

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.309 
gonna kill a lot of my cilia are any of
the<00:02:38.790> fungal<00:02:39.120> spores<00:02:39.150> gonna<00:02:39.630> survive<00:02:40.019> of

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:40.319 
the fungal spores gonna survive of

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:44.720 
the fungal spores gonna survive of
course<00:02:40.910> some<00:02:41.910> will<00:02:42.150> but<00:02:43.049> what<00:02:43.890> deep<00:02:44.099> in<00:02:44.370> soil

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
course some will but what deep in soil

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.819 
course some will but what deep in soil
biologists<00:02:45.299> had<00:02:45.420> recommended<00:02:45.840> instead<00:02:46.620> of

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:46.829 
biologists had recommended instead of

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:49.280 
biologists had recommended instead of
doing<00:02:47.360> putting<00:02:48.360> the<00:02:48.450> compote<00:02:48.900> or<00:02:48.989> started

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
doing putting the compote or started

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.080 
doing putting the compote or started
putting<00:02:49.500> the<00:02:49.590> forest<00:02:49.920> soil<00:02:50.099> into<00:02:50.549> the<00:02:50.579> compost

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
putting the forest soil into the compost

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:54.619 
putting the forest soil into the compost
prior<00:02:51.569> to<00:02:52.049> the<00:02:52.650> composting<00:02:53.160> process<00:02:53.450> why<00:02:54.450> not

00:02:54.619 --> 00:02:54.629 
prior to the composting process why not

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:57.460 
prior to the composting process why not
put<00:02:54.810> it<00:02:54.840> in<00:02:55.049> after<00:02:55.560> so<00:02:56.220> make<00:02:56.910> your<00:02:57.090> compost

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:57.470 
put it in after so make your compost

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:00.740 
put it in after so make your compost
Haden<00:02:58.470> afterwards<00:02:59.430> and<00:02:59.700> try<00:03:00.180> and<00:03:00.390> knock<00:03:00.569> you

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
Haden afterwards and try and knock you

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:02.420 
Haden afterwards and try and knock you
lating<00:03:01.079> it<00:03:01.170> basically<00:03:01.620> dump<00:03:01.829> in<00:03:01.980> your<00:03:02.010> forest

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
lating it basically dump in your forest

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:05.270 
lating it basically dump in your forest
so<00:03:02.579> afterwards<00:03:03.060> in<00:03:03.269> inoculate<00:03:03.840> that<00:03:04.049> soil<00:03:04.349> the

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
so afterwards in inoculate that soil the

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:06.920 
so afterwards in inoculate that soil the
conditions<00:03:05.730> won't<00:03:05.879> be<00:03:06.030> as<00:03:06.150> hard<00:03:06.390> harsh<00:03:06.720> at

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
conditions won't be as hard harsh at

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:09.050 
conditions won't be as hard harsh at
that<00:03:07.079> point<00:03:07.349> and<00:03:07.590> you'll<00:03:07.829> probably<00:03:08.010> have<00:03:08.489> a

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
that point and you'll probably have a

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.530 
that point and you'll probably have a
higher<00:03:09.420> survival<00:03:10.079> rate<00:03:10.700> so<00:03:11.700> hopefully<00:03:12.239> a<00:03:12.269> ting

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
higher survival rate so hopefully a ting

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.990 
higher survival rate so hopefully a ting
that<00:03:12.720> clears<00:03:13.590> that<00:03:13.799> up<00:03:13.859> for<00:03:14.250> you<00:03:14.430> give<00:03:14.850> it<00:03:14.940> a

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
that clears that up for you give it a

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.300 
that clears that up for you give it a
try<00:03:15.150> let<00:03:15.480> us<00:03:15.569> know<00:03:15.750> how<00:03:16.410> it<00:03:16.560> works<00:03:16.799> out<00:03:17.100> and

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
try let us know how it works out and
