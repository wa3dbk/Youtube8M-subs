00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.469 
same values so why can't we all adapt
some<00:01:39.420> of<00:01:39.540> these<00:01:39.630> values<00:01:40.939> this<00:01:41.939> is<00:01:42.060> what<00:01:42.210> I<00:01:42.240> have

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
some of these values this is what I have

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.719 
some of these values this is what I have

to say so do something do something

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.440 
to say so do something do something
positive<00:01:45.680> stop<00:01:46.680> adopting<00:01:47.189> values<00:01:47.729> that<00:01:48.180> turn

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
positive stop adopting values that turn
