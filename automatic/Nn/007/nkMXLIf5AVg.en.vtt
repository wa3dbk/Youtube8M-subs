from the base of the plant that again

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:03.850 
from the base of the plant that again
traces<00:01:02.510> it<00:01:02.630> back<00:01:02.660> to<00:01:02.930> those<00:01:03.020> old<00:01:03.290> European

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:05.990 
roses and that's how almost all hybrid

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:07.929 
roses and that's how almost all hybrid
teas<00:01:06.170> are<00:01:06.380> going<00:01:06.530> to<00:01:06.590> grow<00:01:06.909> floribundas

00:01:07.929 --> 00:01:07.939 
teas are going to grow floribundas

improving<00:01:42.170> on<00:01:42.289> it<00:01:42.350> because<00:01:42.499> it<00:01:42.590> is<00:01:42.709> really

00:01:43.029 --> 00:01:43.039 
improving on it because it is really

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:45.249 
improving on it because it is really
perfection<00:01:43.819> and<00:01:43.969> that<00:01:44.389> basically<00:01:44.929> starts

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:45.259 
perfection and that basically starts

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:47.109 
perfection and that basically starts
this<00:01:45.469> one<00:01:45.649> we're<00:01:45.770> going<00:01:45.859> to<00:01:45.920> pick<00:01:46.130> a<00:01:46.159> height<00:01:46.399> 18

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:47.119 
this one we're going to pick a height 18

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:48.819 
this one we're going to pick a height 18
to<00:01:47.299> 24<00:01:47.810> inches<00:01:47.840> generally<00:01:48.409> gives<00:01:48.590> you<00:01:48.679> that

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:48.829 
to 24 inches generally gives you that

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:50.410 
to 24 inches generally gives you that
sort<00:01:49.100> of<00:01:49.130> size<00:01:49.369> so<00:01:49.909> I'm<00:01:49.969> going<00:01:50.090> to<00:01:50.119> be<00:01:50.240> writing

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:50.420 
sort of size so I'm going to be writing

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:52.959 
sort of size so I'm going to be writing
about<00:01:50.630> here<00:01:51.020> in<00:01:51.170> this<00:01:51.889> case<00:01:52.189> I<00:01:52.429> am<00:01:52.639> going<00:01:52.670> to

about here in this case I am going to

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:55.269 
about here in this case I am going to
look<00:01:53.060> for<00:01:53.119> an<00:01:53.359> outward<00:01:53.509> facing<00:01:53.869> but<00:01:54.229> I<00:01:54.259> why<00:01:54.979> cuz

00:01:55.269 --> 00:01:55.279 
look for an outward facing but I why cuz

00:01:55.279 --> 00:01:57.370 
look for an outward facing but I why cuz
I<00:01:55.609> have<00:01:55.759> long<00:01:55.969> stem<00:01:56.299> flowers<00:01:56.840> I<00:01:56.929> want<00:01:57.200> them

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380 
I have long stem flowers I want them

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.109 
I have long stem flowers I want them
free<00:01:57.799> from<00:01:58.039> the<00:01:58.189> middle<00:01:58.459> and<00:01:58.639> I<00:01:58.850> want<00:01:59.029> them

00:01:59.109 --> 00:01:59.119 
free from the middle and I want them

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:00.519 
free from the middle and I want them
free<00:01:59.329> from<00:01:59.479> bumping<00:01:59.929> into<00:02:00.079> each<00:02:00.200> other<00:02:00.409> and

00:02:00.519 --> 00:02:00.529 
free from bumping into each other and

00:02:00.529 --> 00:02:02.199

bruising and damaging the stems or

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:04.389 
bruising and damaging the stems or
possibly<00:02:03.020> even<00:02:03.139> clipping<00:02:03.709> the<00:02:03.799> heads<00:02:04.009> off

00:02:04.389 --> 00:02:04.399 
possibly even clipping the heads off

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:05.859 
possibly even clipping the heads off
because<00:02:04.880> the<00:02:04.999> other<00:02:05.179> thing<00:02:05.389> that<00:02:05.420> happens

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:05.869 
because the other thing that happens

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:08.139 
because the other thing that happens
with<00:02:06.079> this<00:02:06.229> way<00:02:06.439> I<00:02:06.619> get<00:02:06.889> less<00:02:07.130> flowers<00:02:07.609> but<00:02:08.060> the

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149 
with this way I get less flowers but the

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:10.150 
with this way I get less flowers but the
blooms<00:02:08.390> that<00:02:08.539> I<00:02:08.630> get<00:02:08.840> are<00:02:09.050> bigger<00:02:09.319> which<00:02:09.770> again

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 
blooms that I get are bigger which again

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:11.860 
blooms that I get are bigger which again
for<00:02:10.399> that<00:02:10.520> cut<00:02:10.759> flower<00:02:11.060> is<00:02:11.360> what<00:02:11.510> you<00:02:11.630> really

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
for that cut flower is what you really

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:13.780 
for that cut flower is what you really
really<00:02:11.990> want<00:02:12.260> so<00:02:12.890> we'll<00:02:13.010> start<00:02:13.310> by<00:02:13.520> looking

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
really want so we'll start by looking

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:15.120 
really want so we'll start by looking
for<00:02:14.060> those<00:02:14.150> outward<00:02:14.330> eye

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 
for those outward eye

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:19.980 
for those outward eye
I<00:02:17.940> think<00:02:18.940> we<00:02:19.030> need<00:02:19.180> to<00:02:19.270> talk<00:02:19.480> a<00:02:19.510> little<00:02:19.840> bit

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:19.990 
I think we need to talk a little bit

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:22.560 
I think we need to talk a little bit
about<00:02:20.080> what<00:02:20.500> a<00:02:20.530> butt<00:02:20.800> is<00:02:20.980> now<00:02:21.880> but<00:02:22.060> I<00:02:22.120> can<00:02:22.450> be

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:22.570 
about what a butt is now but I can be

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:24.450 
about what a butt is now but I can be
seen<00:02:22.840> right<00:02:23.170> here<00:02:23.230> you<00:02:23.800> see<00:02:23.950> this<00:02:24.040> little<00:02:24.100> bit

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:24.460 
seen right here you see this little bit

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:25.890 
seen right here you see this little bit
of<00:02:24.520> growth<00:02:24.790> coming<00:02:25.090> out<00:02:25.300> and<00:02:25.450> is<00:02:25.570> swelling

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
of growth coming out and is swelling

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:27.750 
of growth coming out and is swelling
coming<00:02:26.320> up<00:02:26.440> there's<00:02:26.950> almost<00:02:27.280> like<00:02:27.400> like<00:02:27.700> a

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
coming up there's almost like like a

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.700 
coming up there's almost like like a
slight<00:02:28.180> half<00:02:28.480> circle<00:02:28.960> underneath<00:02:29.350> an<00:02:29.530> eye

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:29.710 
slight half circle underneath an eye

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:32.610 
slight half circle underneath an eye
that's<00:02:30.670> the<00:02:31.240> where<00:02:31.690> the<00:02:31.840> new<00:02:32.020> growth<00:02:32.260> comes

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
that's the where the new growth comes

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.130 
that's the where the new growth comes
from<00:02:32.740> on<00:02:33.160> a<00:02:33.220> rose<00:02:33.760> now<00:02:34.660> what<00:02:34.840> we<00:02:34.930> mean<00:02:35.080> by

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140 
from on a rose now what we mean by

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:37.590 
from on a rose now what we mean by
outward<00:02:35.530> facing<00:02:36.070> bud<00:02:36.340> eyes<00:02:36.670> or<00:02:37.060> eyes<00:02:37.270> that

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:37.600 
outward facing bud eyes or eyes that

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.020 
outward facing bud eyes or eyes that
face<00:02:37.840> away<00:02:38.470> from<00:02:38.920> the<00:02:39.010> center<00:02:39.430> of<00:02:39.460> the<00:02:39.730> plant

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
face away from the center of the plant

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:41.940 
face away from the center of the plant
they<00:02:40.270> face<00:02:40.540> out<00:02:40.810> like<00:02:41.320> this<00:02:41.470> one<00:02:41.680> for<00:02:41.860> example

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
they face out like this one for example

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:43.710 
they face out like this one for example
the<00:02:42.700> center<00:02:42.970> of<00:02:43.030> the<00:02:43.090> plants<00:02:43.450> in<00:02:43.570> this

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
the center of the plants in this

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:45.840 
the center of the plants in this
direction<00:02:43.990> so<00:02:44.440> this<00:02:44.860> I<00:02:45.040> was<00:02:45.250> on<00:02:45.400> this<00:02:45.610> side

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:45.850 
direction so this I was on this side

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:47.970 
direction so this I was on this side
that<00:02:45.880> would<00:02:46.270> be<00:02:46.360> an<00:02:46.450> inward<00:02:46.810> facing<00:02:46.990> but<00:02:47.380> I<00:02:47.410> so

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
that would be an inward facing but I so

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:49.830 
that would be an inward facing but I so
again<00:02:48.250> a<00:02:48.400> bud<00:02:48.640> is<00:02:48.910> swelling<00:02:49.360> on<00:02:49.480> the<00:02:49.600> cane

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
again a bud is swelling on the cane

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.630 
again a bud is swelling on the cane
that's<00:02:50.500> where<00:02:50.710> your<00:02:50.830> new<00:02:50.980> growth<00:02:51.220> comes<00:02:51.550> from

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 
that's where your new growth comes from

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.960 
that's where your new growth comes from
and<00:02:52.030> that's<00:02:52.420> all<00:02:52.660> it<00:02:52.810> is<00:02:53.730> first<00:02:54.730> thing<00:02:54.880> I'm

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
and that's all it is first thing I'm

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:56.310 
and that's all it is first thing I'm
going<00:02:55.090> to<00:02:55.150> do<00:02:55.270> is<00:02:55.510> go<00:02:55.660> find<00:02:55.900> that<00:02:55.960> out<00:02:56.170> we're

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:56.320 
going to do is go find that out we're

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:58.170 
going to do is go find that out we're
facing<00:02:56.530> on<00:02:56.800> I've<00:02:57.340> got<00:02:57.550> one<00:02:57.730> right<00:02:57.910> here<00:02:58.090> I'm

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
facing on I've got one right here I'm

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.090 
facing on I've got one right here I'm
going<00:02:58.330> to<00:02:58.390> cut<00:02:58.570> here<00:02:58.840> I've<00:02:59.500> got<00:02:59.740> an<00:02:59.830> outward

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:00.100 
going to cut here I've got an outward

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:02.400 
going to cut here I've got an outward
facing<00:03:00.280> eye<00:03:00.610> here<00:03:01.000> and<00:03:01.360> you<00:03:01.690> can<00:03:01.840> see<00:03:02.020> how<00:03:02.200> low

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:02.410 
facing eye here and you can see how low

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:04.140 
facing eye here and you can see how low
I'm<00:03:02.590> cutting<00:03:02.980> I'm<00:03:03.160> cutting<00:03:03.670> down<00:03:03.820> to<00:03:03.970> almost

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.150 
I'm cutting I'm cutting down to almost

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.930 
I'm cutting I'm cutting down to almost
18<00:03:04.750> inches<00:03:05.050> high<00:03:05.260> now<00:03:06.220> this<00:03:06.400> is<00:03:06.520> coming<00:03:06.820> into

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:06.940 
18 inches high now this is coming into

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:08.280 
18 inches high now this is coming into
the<00:03:07.060> middle<00:03:07.270> in<00:03:07.450> this<00:03:07.570> case<00:03:07.780> I<00:03:07.930> am<00:03:08.050> going<00:03:08.170> to

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.290 
the middle in this case I am going to

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:10.500 
the middle in this case I am going to
take<00:03:08.470> it<00:03:08.590> out<00:03:08.820> looking<00:03:09.820> for<00:03:09.970> a<00:03:10.030> candelabra

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 
take it out looking for a candelabra

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:12.540 
take it out looking for a candelabra
shape<00:03:10.900> that<00:03:11.650> here<00:03:11.950> I<00:03:11.980> don't<00:03:12.220> have<00:03:12.310> a<00:03:12.340> nice

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:12.550 
shape that here I don't have a nice
