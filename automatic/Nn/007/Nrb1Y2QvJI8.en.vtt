else using the internet etc etc and I've

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.850 
else using the internet etc etc and I've
always<00:01:27.390> found<00:01:27.600> workarounds<00:01:28.350> but<00:01:28.530> I<00:01:28.680> have

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
always found workarounds but I have

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.590 
always found workarounds but I have
actually<00:01:29.159> come<00:01:29.369> to<00:01:29.490> a<00:01:29.520> point<00:01:29.700> where<00:01:29.939> I<00:01:30.119> can't

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
actually come to a point where I can't

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.929 
actually come to a point where I can't
find<00:01:30.900> a<00:01:31.049> workaround<00:01:31.409> for<00:01:31.770> this<00:01:32.130> problem<00:01:32.759> and

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
find a workaround for this problem and

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.690 
find a workaround for this problem and
the<00:01:33.479> problem<00:01:33.509> is<00:01:33.869> that<00:01:34.229> the<00:01:34.380> Xbox<00:01:34.770> one<00:01:34.979> uses<00:01:35.549> up

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
the problem is that the Xbox one uses up

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.440 
the problem is that the Xbox one uses up
more<00:01:35.880> internet<00:01:36.659> than<00:01:37.320> the<00:01:37.799> Xbox<00:01:38.280> 360<00:01:38.909> FIFA<00:01:39.210> 14

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
more internet than the Xbox 360 FIFA 14

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.810 
more internet than the Xbox 360 FIFA 14
and<00:01:39.869> therefore<00:01:40.320> I<00:01:40.500> can't<00:01:40.770> play<00:01:40.979> it<00:01:41.159> during<00:01:41.700> the

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
and therefore I can't play it during the

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.270 
and therefore I can't play it during the
day<00:01:41.970> now<00:01:42.509> I<00:01:42.840> can't<00:01:43.590> actually<00:01:43.710> play<00:01:44.009> the<00:01:44.250> game

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
day now I can't actually play the game

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.429 
day now I can't actually play the game
at<00:01:44.610> all<00:01:44.850> at<00:01:45.090> the<00:01:45.149> moment<00:01:45.299> I<00:01:45.570> cannot<00:01:45.990> play<00:01:46.200> it<00:01:46.229> at

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
at all at the moment I cannot play it at

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.560 
at all at the moment I cannot play it at
any<00:01:46.799> time<00:01:47.130> of<00:01:47.280> the<00:01:47.310> day<00:01:47.369> before<00:01:48.329> you're

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570

against someone
it<00:02:04.170> was<00:02:04.560> unplayable<00:02:05.490> like<00:02:05.939> the<00:02:06.090> lag<00:02:06.360> was

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
it was unplayable like the lag was

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.330 
it was unplayable like the lag was
ridiculous<00:02:07.259> we're<00:02:07.409> talking<00:02:07.710> like<00:02:07.860> probably

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
ridiculous we're talking like probably

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.219 
ridiculous we're talking like probably
the<00:02:08.459> best<00:02:08.610> part<00:02:08.819> of<00:02:08.940> minutes<00:02:09.420> to<00:02:09.869> get<00:02:10.020> through

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
the best part of minutes to get through

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:11.559 
the best part of minutes to get through
about<00:02:10.349> three<00:02:11.039> minutes

00:02:11.559 --> 00:02:11.569 
about three minutes

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:13.479 
about three minutes
actual<00:02:11.989> in<00:02:12.170> gameplay<00:02:12.409> which<00:02:12.890> is<00:02:13.069> just

00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:13.489 
actual in gameplay which is just

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:15.190 
actual in gameplay which is just
ridiculous<00:02:14.030> just<00:02:14.480> stuttering<00:02:14.870> the<00:02:15.019> whole

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
ridiculous just stuttering the whole

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.500 
ridiculous just stuttering the whole
time<00:02:15.379> and<00:02:15.590> completely<00:02:16.069> unplayable<00:02:16.670> now<00:02:17.450> the

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
time and completely unplayable now the

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:19.360 
time and completely unplayable now the
workaround<00:02:18.019> I<00:02:18.170> found<00:02:18.439> was<00:02:18.680> to<00:02:18.859> actually<00:02:19.010> stay

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
workaround I found was to actually stay

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.879 
workaround I found was to actually stay
up<00:02:19.400> until<00:02:20.269> two<00:02:20.599> o'clock<00:02:20.930> in<00:02:20.989> the<00:02:21.139> morning<00:02:21.260> so

I've been working from two o'clock until

00:02:31.899 --> 00:02:31.909 
road to glory on the Xbox one because at

00:02:31.909 --> 00:02:33.670 
road to glory on the Xbox one because at
night<00:02:32.180> there's<00:02:32.719> less<00:02:32.870> people<00:02:33.079> in<00:02:33.260> the<00:02:33.379> area

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
night there's less people in the area

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.050 
night there's less people in the area
using<00:02:33.920> the<00:02:34.010> Internet<00:02:34.400> and<00:02:34.549> therefore<00:02:34.939> the

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
using the Internet and therefore the

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.750 
using the Internet and therefore the
Internet<00:02:35.450> company<00:02:35.840> which<00:02:36.560> for<00:02:36.889> me<00:02:36.980> is<00:02:37.010> sky<00:02:37.459> and

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
Internet company which for me is sky and

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.569 
Internet company which for me is sky and
actually<00:02:38.750> stop<00:02:39.439> limiting<00:02:40.040> how<00:02:40.280> much

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:40.579 
actually stop limiting how much

00:02:40.579 --> 00:02:42.909 
actually stop limiting how much
bandwidth<00:02:41.150> you<00:02:41.299> get<00:02:41.510> so<00:02:41.870> I<00:02:42.109> had<00:02:42.379> more<00:02:42.590> internet

00:02:42.909 --> 00:02:42.919 
bandwidth you get so I had more internet

00:02:42.919 --> 00:02:43.990 
bandwidth you get so I had more internet
during<00:02:43.069> the<00:02:43.189> night<00:02:43.340> and<00:02:43.549> therefore<00:02:43.879> I<00:02:43.909> could

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
during the night and therefore I could

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.970 
during the night and therefore I could
use<00:02:44.299> it<00:02:44.480> now<00:02:44.900> just<00:02:45.409> in<00:02:45.560> the<00:02:45.650> run-up<00:02:45.829> to

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 
use it now just in the run-up to

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:48.429 
use it now just in the run-up to
Christmas<00:02:46.099> and<00:02:46.760> over<00:02:47.480> the<00:02:47.569> new<00:02:47.750> year<00:02:47.780> I've

so<00:03:02.989> that<00:03:03.859> puts<00:03:04.250> me<00:03:04.400> in<00:03:04.609> a<00:03:04.760> bit<00:03:04.939> of<00:03:05.060> a<00:03:05.150> problem

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:05.359 
so that puts me in a bit of a problem

00:03:05.359 --> 00:03:08.740 
so that puts me in a bit of a problem
because<00:03:05.840> this<00:03:06.079> is<00:03:06.349> a<00:03:06.379> next-gen<00:03:06.980> fifa14<00:03:07.849> rotary

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750 
because this is a next-gen fifa14 rotary

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:11.080 
because this is a next-gen fifa14 rotary
and<00:03:09.079> if<00:03:09.199> I'm<00:03:09.319> playing<00:03:09.590> on<00:03:09.769> xbox360<00:03:10.730> is<00:03:10.879> that's

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
and if I'm playing on xbox360 is that's

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:13.809 
and if I'm playing on xbox360 is that's
the<00:03:11.209> only<00:03:11.449> console<00:03:11.810> I<00:03:11.930> can<00:03:12.290> play<00:03:12.560> now<00:03:12.829> it's<00:03:13.159> not

00:03:13.809 --> 00:03:13.819 
the only console I can play now it's not

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:15.849 
the only console I can play now it's not
really<00:03:14.090> next-gen<00:03:14.540> is<00:03:14.689> it<00:03:14.870> so<00:03:15.169> what<00:03:15.709> I'm

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:15.859 
really next-gen is it so what I'm

00:03:15.859 --> 00:03:17.679 
really next-gen is it so what I'm
thinking<00:03:16.340> is<00:03:16.549> that<00:03:16.579> I'm<00:03:16.909> actually<00:03:17.150> going<00:03:17.449> to

00:03:17.679 --> 00:03:17.689 
thinking is that I'm actually going to

00:03:17.689 --> 00:03:20.229 
thinking is that I'm actually going to
stop<00:03:18.259> the<00:03:18.560> series<00:03:18.979> after<00:03:19.280> this<00:03:19.549> episode<00:03:19.729> so

00:03:20.229 --> 00:03:20.239 
stop the series after this episode so

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:22.149 
stop the series after this episode so
we've<00:03:20.359> got<00:03:20.540> two<00:03:20.689> episode<00:03:21.139> number<00:03:21.319> 30<00:03:21.709> I<00:03:21.859> think

00:03:22.149 --> 00:03:22.159 
we've got two episode number 30 I think

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:23.830 
we've got two episode number 30 I think
we've<00:03:22.280> done<00:03:22.430> pretty<00:03:22.699> well<00:03:22.819> I'm<00:03:23.329> gonna<00:03:23.509> end<00:03:23.720> up

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:23.840 
we've done pretty well I'm gonna end up

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:26.559 
we've done pretty well I'm gonna end up
with<00:03:23.989> a<00:03:24.049> record<00:03:24.290> of<00:03:24.560> about<00:03:24.859> 64<00:03:25.669> 20<00:03:26.150> losses

00:03:26.559 --> 00:03:26.569 
with a record of about 64 20 losses

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:28.270 
with a record of about 64 20 losses
which<00:03:26.780> isn't<00:03:27.019> too<00:03:27.319> bad<00:03:27.349> we've<00:03:27.829> built<00:03:28.069> some

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:28.280 
which isn't too bad we've built some

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.819 
which isn't too bad we've built some
really<00:03:28.519> nice<00:03:28.849> teams<00:03:29.269> and<00:03:29.509> you<00:03:30.409> know<00:03:30.560> I<00:03:30.590> think

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:30.829 
really nice teams and you know I think

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:32.589 
really nice teams and you know I think
that<00:03:31.129> it's<00:03:31.310> probably<00:03:31.579> about<00:03:31.909> time<00:03:32.299> that<00:03:32.479> we

00:03:32.589 --> 00:03:32.599 
that it's probably about time that we

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:33.849 
that it's probably about time that we
ended<00:03:32.810> just<00:03:33.019> have<00:03:33.139> to<00:03:33.229> stop<00:03:33.439> because<00:03:33.560> that<00:03:33.650> is

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:33.859 
ended just have to stop because that is

00:03:33.859 --> 00:03:35.619 
ended just have to stop because that is
an<00:03:33.979> absolutely<00:03:34.340> amazing<00:03:34.489> goal<00:03:34.970> by<00:03:35.150> Lucas<00:03:35.509> they

00:03:35.619 --> 00:03:35.629 
an absolutely amazing goal by Lucas they

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:37.360 
an absolutely amazing goal by Lucas they
go<00:03:35.840> back<00:03:36.019> and<00:03:36.169> reward<00:03:36.439> we<00:03:36.709> watch<00:03:36.919> that<00:03:37.159> if<00:03:37.280> you

and now you're probably wondering how am
I<00:04:18.590> going<00:04:18.769> to<00:04:18.919> fix<00:04:19.130> you<00:04:19.459> know<00:04:19.609> me<00:04:19.909> having<00:04:20.269> bad

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:20.510 
I going to fix you know me having bad

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:22.360 
I going to fix you know me having bad
internet<00:04:20.870> that's<00:04:21.139> impossible<00:04:21.709> well

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:22.370 
internet that's impossible well

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:24.040 
internet that's impossible well
the<00:04:22.430> simplest<00:04:22.790> solution<00:04:23.330> is<00:04:23.449> for<00:04:23.690> me<00:04:23.780> to<00:04:23.900> move

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:24.050 
the simplest solution is for me to move

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:25.629 
the simplest solution is for me to move
and<00:04:24.320> that<00:04:24.410> is<00:04:24.560> what's<00:04:24.740> actually<00:04:25.100> happening

00:04:25.629 --> 00:04:25.639 
and that is what's actually happening

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:27.250 
and that is what's actually happening
it's<00:04:25.790> not<00:04:25.880> because<00:04:26.300> of<00:04:26.479> the<00:04:26.540> internet<00:04:26.870> problem

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:27.260 
it's not because of the internet problem

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:30.040 
it's not because of the internet problem
or<00:04:27.919> partly<00:04:28.280> of<00:04:28.460> it<00:04:28.580> is<00:04:28.729> but<00:04:29.030> the<00:04:29.690> real<00:04:29.900> reason

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:30.050 
or partly of it is but the real reason

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:31.480 
or partly of it is but the real reason
I'm<00:04:30.320> moving<00:04:30.470> is<00:04:30.830> because<00:04:31.070> I'm<00:04:31.160> moving<00:04:31.250> in<00:04:31.460> with

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:31.490 
I'm moving is because I'm moving in with
