00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120
 hello assholes if you already read the title because it's the truth 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.750
 dimon is already shit of the same shit that comes out of God's shit 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.850
 bush I'm worth all the comments of the assholes who say that dimon is 

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:11.559
 better now 

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:16.049
 and all those mothers because I really do not see him anymore. 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.750
 every how many years we see more shits of those on the internet and then a 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:23.789
 television they think to be able to them just because it's educational that's pure shit 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.910
 my nephew does not like that shit of lemons minions 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.410
 or you go what it is but he says he is bored and prefers to see with him 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.900
 lawsuit and 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.140
 honestly since it was created dimona venture they should have left it there 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:39.180
 because after the second season that shit was already starting to 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.030
 disappear 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:43.530
 because in truth the other rooms have nothing to do with the first 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.420
 from here I'll start loving kill all areas except the first and the 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.990
 third 

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:51.100
 because he considered that they were better than the rest 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:54.710
 with will help me to be more explanatory for the useless that you 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:57.490
 like the new seasons of beautiful mountain 

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:01.010
 to psoe with alias the licentious pancho and lover of the mermaid tectonics enter 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:05.449
 good is that I will help because I also do not like that mom of the new 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:08.130
 seasons but I will only help you a little 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:08.890
 it's okay 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:10.370
 then it starts 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:11.670
 First season 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.800
 name of the series of simona ventura 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:17.800
 this saga was one of the animes of my first years I still remember it 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.800
 the story had no exaggeration 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:23.380
 had a specific idea his animation was not the best but his 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:27.500
 fights and stories were good not like the others I think this saga had 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.460
 two seasons because the villain were two to remember but still it was a 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.320
 of the best anime that was in our childhood 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.770
 second season 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:38.250
 name of the series of simona ventura and 2 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.320
 I swallow it 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.610
 because this is a fake copy of the first 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.590
 they really believed that it would be better than the first one because I did not consider it 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.909
 A) Yes 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:49.530
 this saga should have gone more the characters of the first saga the 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.020
 story did not have a point 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.070
 the directions were a bit original but nothing to do with the original 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:55.580
 lemon 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:59.410
 because this time the lemons had to direct evolve with some objects that 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:01.320
 they gave him different powers 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.390
 this mom da was the one that pissed me off or 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.870
 because we expected their evolutions to be the only ones of the 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:09.870
 lemons and not by objects that gave different powers 

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:13.209
 his final was one of the best in the saga 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:14.520
 third season 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.519
 name of the series from montaner 

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:20.370
 the only thing in this saga that had much anger was the use of the letters 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.629
 because they considered that they were copies of yukio 

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:24.319
 but his story was original 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:25.580
 his characters equal 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:29.750
 the digimon is original their fights were possibly the best of 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.769
 all areas only what I did not like was the villain 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:36.709
 we expected the villains to be from the same gods of the digimon do 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:40.640
 and considered one of the best because his story is more advanced to the world 

00:02:40.639 --> 00:02:41.099
 real 

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:43.110
 if we compare this saga with all 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:47.000
 is the only one that has chapters in the real world that the digimon is 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.970
 like the story of kaká pto this kid shows us our childhood 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.129
 of us when we wanted a lemon 

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:55.459
 that's why it's one of the best sagas 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:56.720
 fourth season 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:58.859
 Name of the Simón Frontier series 

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:01.040
 this saga has enough names 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:02.869
 fucking bullshit 

00:03:02.869 --> 00:03:07.079
 and everything that can be said this saga bored me bored me so much that 

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:10.789
 I only saw the first and last chapters and for some I asked 

00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:11.569
 for creating and 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:15.540
 Well, I had hope that it was better than the third but not the story 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:19.180
 boring we said the month that accompanied the children just gave me 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:23.319
 disgust those we live month because its design bored had nothing funny two 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:26.379
 nonsense and the worst of this saga is that there were no lemons 

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:28.939
 it was just the children and their bullshit evolutions 

00:03:28.939 --> 00:03:32.769
 each one of its evolutions could be of the last evolutions of others 

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:33.789
 digimon is 

00:03:33.789 --> 00:03:37.419
 the only good thing about this saga was the character design that is of the 

00:03:37.419 --> 00:03:41.129
 best of all areas and nothing else because the ending was asshole 

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:45.209
 the story was pendeja the bad guy was stupid and everything was stupid 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:46.480
 fifth season 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.029
 name of the series since monza 3 

00:03:49.029 --> 00:03:51.440
 I regret having seen all the chapters 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:53.449
 I shit on your fucking asshole 

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:56.959
 I saw the season just because the digimon came out of the first 

00:03:56.959 --> 00:03:59.959
 season and apparently it was going to be original of the saga 

00:04:00.679 --> 00:04:05.189
 their evolutions were no longer the same they were more sophisticated and more exaggerated 

00:04:05.189 --> 00:04:09.539
 had many evolutions last stage every evolution was more exaggerated than 

00:04:09.539 --> 00:04:12.999
 the other and even worse the latest evolutions were more crap than all 

00:04:12.999 --> 00:04:13.859
 the Serie 

00:04:13.859 --> 00:04:17.120
 his story was more normal than the first one but I regret having seen it 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:20.650
 for the final subnormal asshole that instead of ending the bad with evolution 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:24.849
 of the last stage ends with his first evolution his final was one of 

00:04:24.849 --> 00:04:26.699
 the most pendeja I've seen 

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:30.490
 sixth season name of the series of simulations wars 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:34.540
 I only saw the first chapter and I never see this saga again from the first 

00:04:34.539 --> 00:04:36.780
 moment that was narrating the protagonist 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:39.969
 this saga was already starting to fall badly 

00:04:39.969 --> 00:04:43.259
 with help me with the mistakes and bad taste of this saga 

00:04:43.259 --> 00:04:44.460
 good first 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:47.410
 according to him he tells me that the protagonist is a boy is a boy 

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:48.330
 prodigy 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:50.849
 jajajajajajajajaja I continued with 

00:04:50.849 --> 00:04:54.009
 this child I thought he had only one talent 

00:04:54.009 --> 00:04:55.849
 he is not the perfect man 

00:04:55.849 --> 00:05:00.279
 has the ability to be the best in sports in expert ratings 

00:05:00.279 --> 00:05:01.240
 in the technology 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:02.470
 perfect in fuck 

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:06.390
 perfect in money and more things but this kid was one of those who never 

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:07.520
 they should have put 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:09.189
 because it does not represent anything good 

00:05:09.189 --> 00:05:12.479
 only represents that prodigies have more opportunity than 

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:15.190
 us and everything that this saga has is pure machine 

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:19.460
 and it still looks a lot like the ranger payments the dimonis joins and they become one 

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:19.949
 same 

00:05:19.949 --> 00:05:23.650
 but the worst are his powers so more than they are the ones paid heran gehrke his 

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:27.150
 power saleh a pendejo symbol that is more shit than the youth their naruto 

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:29.139
 I shit on my own bullshit 

00:05:29.139 --> 00:05:32.110
 seriously, that lemon shit should not come out 

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:33.440
 with more times they put it 

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:35.430
 the worse the matter gets 

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:38.310
 I swear that if they continue putting new sagas de dimon 

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:41.940
 well celtic area all those shits because they already tired me and still a 

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:45.100
 lens watch it happens to them to put it on TV so children too 

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:48.460
 throw up in their homes and have compulsions when they see them 

00:05:49.189 --> 00:05:50.389
 Well that's it 

00:05:50.389 --> 00:05:52.740
 I do not want to follow him because if this continued 

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:54.249
 it would never end 

00:05:54.249 --> 00:05:56.339
 I hope you liked it 

00:05:56.339 --> 00:06:00.849
 comment and subscribe ugly if not digimon will appear where it hurts most in the 

00:06:00.849 --> 00:06:03.199
 bathroom xd xd xd by ddb 

00:06:03.199 --> 00:06:05.270
