you know how to aim shoot and move I'll
go<00:00:11.309> through<00:00:11.550> each<00:00:11.759> of<00:00:12.059> the<00:00:12.240> four<00:00:12.480> weapons<00:00:12.929> and

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
go through each of the four weapons and

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.410 
go through each of the four weapons and
teach<00:00:13.440> you<00:00:13.650> how<00:00:13.830> to<00:00:13.860> use<00:00:14.250> them<00:00:14.490> I'm<00:00:14.759> going<00:00:15.330> to

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
teach you how to use them I'm going to

start<00:00:15.660> with<00:00:15.809> the<00:00:15.960> desert<00:00:16.320> eagle<00:00:16.560> the<00:00:17.340> desert

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
start with the desert eagle the desert

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.179 
start with the desert eagle the desert
eagle<00:00:17.880> is<00:00:18.150> a<00:00:18.270> cheap<00:00:18.539> efficient<00:00:19.439> and<00:00:19.619> powerful

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
eagle is a cheap efficient and powerful

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.429 
eagle is a cheap efficient and powerful
killing<00:00:20.400> machine<00:00:20.880> you<00:00:21.449> hold<00:00:21.600> it<00:00:21.720> as<00:00:21.840> a<00:00:21.869> sidearm

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
killing machine you hold it as a sidearm

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.340 
killing machine you hold it as a sidearm
so<00:00:22.740> you<00:00:22.830> can<00:00:22.980> also<00:00:23.189> use<00:00:23.490> it<00:00:23.699> with<00:00:23.820> a<00:00:23.880> primary

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:24.350 
so you can also use it with a primary

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:27.050 
so you can also use it with a primary
we've<00:00:25.350> shortened<00:00:25.650> the<00:00:25.740> name<00:00:25.769> desert<00:00:26.460> eagle<00:00:26.849> to

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
we've shortened the name desert eagle to

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.830 
we've shortened the name desert eagle to
deagle<00:00:27.960> but<00:00:28.349> it's<00:00:28.590> the<00:00:28.800> same<00:00:28.949> thing<00:00:29.630> the<00:00:30.630> first

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
deagle but it's the same thing the first

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.590 
deagle but it's the same thing the first
question<00:00:31.470> you<00:00:31.500> may<00:00:31.740> ask<00:00:31.769> is<00:00:32.340> when<00:00:33.059> do<00:00:33.210> you<00:00:33.390> use

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
question you may ask is when do you use

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.440 
question you may ask is when do you use
the<00:00:33.809> deagle<00:00:34.140> well<00:00:35.010> you<00:00:35.610> use<00:00:35.820> the<00:00:36.000> deagle<00:00:36.270> when

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
the deagle well you use the deagle when

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:37.880 
the deagle well you use the deagle when
you<00:00:36.540> cannot<00:00:36.780> afford<00:00:37.110> to<00:00:37.290> buy<00:00:37.440> one<00:00:37.680> of<00:00:37.710> the

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
you cannot afford to buy one of the

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.340 
you cannot afford to buy one of the
rifles<00:00:38.280> or<00:00:38.850> as<00:00:39.149> a<00:00:39.300> secondary<00:00:39.899> when<00:00:40.110> you<00:00:40.230> were

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
rifles or as a secondary when you were

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.369 
rifles or as a secondary when you were
using<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:40.950> OP<00:00:41.100> it<00:00:41.850> is<00:00:42.329> an<00:00:42.450> economy<00:00:42.719> weapon<00:00:43.230> as

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
using the OP it is an economy weapon as

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.650 
using the OP it is an economy weapon as
powerful<00:00:44.129> as<00:00:44.250> the<00:00:44.370> rifles<00:00:44.730> but<00:00:45.300> at<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:45.480> same

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
powerful as the rifles but at the same

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.950 
powerful as the rifles but at the same
time<00:00:45.960> much<00:00:46.530> cheaper<00:00:47.329> why<00:00:48.329> would<00:00:48.480> we<00:00:48.629> use<00:00:48.660> the

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
time much cheaper why would we use the

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.840 
time much cheaper why would we use the
deagle<00:00:49.260> instead<00:00:49.649> of<00:00:49.770> other<00:00:50.010> cost-efficient

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
deagle instead of other cost-efficient

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.610 
deagle instead of other cost-efficient

makes<00:01:05.880> it<00:01:06.090> the<00:01:06.330> most<00:01:06.530> cost-efficient<00:01:07.530> weapon

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
makes it the most cost-efficient weapon

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.270 
makes it the most cost-efficient weapon
in<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.369> game<00:01:08.720> one<00:01:09.720> shot<00:01:10.080> kills<00:01:10.409> our<00:01:10.710> linearly

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
in the game one shot kills our linearly

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.510 
in the game one shot kills our linearly
better<00:01:11.700> than<00:01:11.970> weapons<00:01:12.180> that<00:01:12.540> take<00:01:12.750> more<00:01:13.020> shots

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:13.520 
better than weapons that take more shots

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.160 
better than weapons that take more shots
think<00:01:14.520> of<00:01:14.610> it<00:01:14.700> this<00:01:14.820> way<00:01:15.030> let's<00:01:15.720> say<00:01:15.930> you<00:01:15.990> have

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
think of it this way let's say you have

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.380 
think of it this way let's say you have
a<00:01:16.200> weapon<00:01:16.470> that<00:01:16.740> is<00:01:16.860> a<00:01:16.890> two-shot<00:01:17.369> kill<00:01:17.400> and<00:01:17.880> has

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
a weapon that is a two-shot kill and has

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:19.940 
a weapon that is a two-shot kill and has
a<00:01:18.420> much<00:01:18.659> faster<00:01:18.900> firing<00:01:19.500> rate<00:01:19.680> than<00:01:19.860> the

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
a much faster firing rate than the

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.070 
a much faster firing rate than the
deagle<00:01:20.280> you<00:01:20.880> turn<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:21.240> corner<00:01:21.360> and<00:01:21.659> fight<00:01:22.049> a

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
deagle you turn the corner and fight a

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.170 
deagle you turn the corner and fight a
guy<00:01:22.259> with<00:01:22.439> the<00:01:22.530> deagle<00:01:22.850> assuming<00:01:23.850> that<00:01:23.970> both

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
guy with the deagle assuming that both

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.510 
guy with the deagle assuming that both
players<00:01:24.509> perform<00:01:25.020> perfectly<00:01:25.290> then<00:01:26.250> both

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
players perform perfectly then both

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.850 
players perform perfectly then both
shots<00:01:26.820> hit<00:01:27.060> the<00:01:27.180> head<00:01:27.360> at<00:01:27.479> the<00:01:27.509> same<00:01:27.810> time<00:01:28.110> the

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
shots hit the head at the same time the

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.039 
shots hit the head at the same time the
deagle<00:01:29.250> will<00:01:29.430> kill<00:01:29.670> you<00:01:29.880> before<00:01:30.090> you<00:01:30.450> are<00:01:30.630> able

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
deagle will kill you before you are able

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.620 
deagle will kill you before you are able
to<00:01:31.079> get<00:01:31.320> those<00:01:31.500> two<00:01:31.740> shots<00:01:32.040> off<00:01:32.250> it<00:01:33.210> just<00:01:33.450> makes

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
to get those two shots off it just makes

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.240 
to get those two shots off it just makes
sense<00:01:33.840> and<00:01:34.170> because<00:01:34.470> I'm<00:01:34.710> teaching<00:01:34.860> you<00:01:35.130> how

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
sense and because I'm teaching you how

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.490 
sense and because I'm teaching you how
to<00:01:35.280> play<00:01:35.460> competitively<00:01:36.119> we<00:01:36.780> have<00:01:36.990> to<00:01:37.170> assume

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
to play competitively we have to assume

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.310 
to play competitively we have to assume
that<00:01:37.740> every<00:01:38.159> shot<00:01:38.460> lands<00:01:39.119> there's<00:01:40.079> another

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
that every shot lands there's another

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.560 
that every shot lands there's another
reason<00:01:40.560> why<00:01:40.829> the<00:01:40.890> deagle<00:01:41.310> is<00:01:41.490> so<00:01:41.700> amazing<00:01:42.390> and

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
reason why the deagle is so amazing and

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.740 
reason why the deagle is so amazing and
that<00:01:42.930> is<00:01:43.140> its<00:01:43.409> accuracy<00:01:44.130> its<00:01:44.700> accuracy<00:01:45.360> makes

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
that is its accuracy its accuracy makes

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.600 
that is its accuracy its accuracy makes
it<00:01:45.930> a<00:01:46.020> good<00:01:46.259> weapon<00:01:46.649> for<00:01:46.680> both<00:01:46.979> close<00:01:47.310> combat

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
it a good weapon for both close combat

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.170 
it a good weapon for both close combat
and<00:01:47.939> medium-range<00:01:48.869> combat<00:01:49.640> ok<00:01:50.640> so<00:01:50.939> now<00:01:51.119> that

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
and medium-range combat ok so now that

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.969 
and medium-range combat ok so now that
you<00:01:51.420> know<00:01:51.570> what<00:01:51.840> it<00:01:51.930> is<00:01:52.079> and<00:01:52.350> why<00:01:52.560> you<00:01:52.619> should

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
you know what it is and why you should

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.539 
you know what it is and why you should
use<00:01:53.009> it<00:01:53.340> how<00:01:53.909> do<00:01:53.970> you<00:01:54.180> use<00:01:54.390> it<00:01:54.600> well<00:01:55.439> put<00:01:56.399> the

techniques taught in the last lesson and

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.469 
techniques taught in the last lesson and
then<00:02:01.290> click<00:02:01.560> once<00:02:02.270> personally<00:02:03.270> I<00:02:03.299> always

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
then click once personally I always

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:06.440 
then click once personally I always
shoot<00:02:04.170> the<00:02:04.320> deagle<00:02:04.619> twice<00:02:04.950> because<00:02:05.670> I<00:02:06.090> got<00:02:06.299> in

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
shoot the deagle twice because I got in

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.869 
shoot the deagle twice because I got in
that<00:02:06.600> habit<00:02:06.930> from<00:02:07.049> playing<00:02:07.350> 1.6<00:02:08.069> where<00:02:08.670> the

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
that habit from playing 1.6 where the

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:10.490 
that habit from playing 1.6 where the
deagle<00:02:09.149> would<00:02:09.330> always<00:02:09.509> be<00:02:09.780> a<00:02:09.810> perfectly

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
deagle would always be a perfectly

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.680 
deagle would always be a perfectly
accurate<00:02:10.739> shot<00:02:11.190> on<00:02:11.400> the<00:02:11.520> second<00:02:11.970> shot

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
accurate shot on the second shot

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.900 
accurate shot on the second shot
in<00:02:13.170> counter-strike<00:02:13.950> source<00:02:14.010> it<00:02:14.550> is<00:02:14.580> more

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
in counter-strike source it is more

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:17.330 
in counter-strike source it is more
accurate<00:02:15.390> on<00:02:15.540> the<00:02:15.660> first<00:02:15.990> shot<00:02:16.380> so<00:02:16.980> you<00:02:17.010> only

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
accurate on the first shot so you only

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.820 
accurate on the first shot so you only
have<00:02:17.490> to<00:02:17.610> shoot<00:02:17.940> it<00:02:18.060> once<00:02:18.360> per<00:02:18.630> kill<00:02:18.870> the

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
have to shoot it once per kill the

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.740 
have to shoot it once per kill the
deagle<00:02:20.160> has<00:02:20.370> seven<00:02:20.760> rounds<00:02:21.270> and<00:02:21.390> it<00:02:21.600> is

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
deagle has seven rounds and it is

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.020 
deagle has seven rounds and it is
extremely<00:02:22.260> important<00:02:22.980> to<00:02:23.190> keep<00:02:23.220> tabs<00:02:23.610> on<00:02:23.850> how

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
extremely important to keep tabs on how

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.420 
extremely important to keep tabs on how
many<00:02:24.090> rounds<00:02:24.570> you<00:02:24.660> have<00:02:24.690> left<00:02:25.110> keep<00:02:26.040> in<00:02:26.190> mind

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
many rounds you have left keep in mind

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.370 
many rounds you have left keep in mind
it<00:02:26.640> only<00:02:26.820> takes<00:02:27.150> one<00:02:27.240> shot<00:02:27.750> to<00:02:27.960> kill<00:02:28.110> someone

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
it only takes one shot to kill someone

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.980 
it only takes one shot to kill someone
so<00:02:29.100> there<00:02:29.250> is<00:02:29.340> no<00:02:29.670> reason<00:02:29.970> to<00:02:30.180> reload<00:02:30.630> unless

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:30.990 
so there is no reason to reload unless

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:32.990 
so there is no reason to reload unless
you<00:02:31.140> are<00:02:31.260> completely<00:02:31.770> sure<00:02:32.190> you<00:02:32.370> are<00:02:32.520> safe<00:02:32.790> and

you are completely sure you are safe and
have<00:02:33.150> time<00:02:33.500> also<00:02:34.500> the<00:02:35.340> deagle<00:02:35.670> is<00:02:35.820> a<00:02:35.850> very<00:02:36.150> loud

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
have time also the deagle is a very loud

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:37.940 
have time also the deagle is a very loud
weapon<00:02:37.020> and<00:02:37.230> you<00:02:37.380> should<00:02:37.560> be<00:02:37.680> able<00:02:37.800> to

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
weapon and you should be able to

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.340 
weapon and you should be able to
identify<00:02:38.130> it<00:02:38.640> if<00:02:38.910> your<00:02:39.420> enemy<00:02:39.780> is<00:02:39.810> using<00:02:40.050> it

identify it if your enemy is using it
based<00:02:40.830> on<00:02:41.100> that<00:02:41.280> sound<00:02:41.990> because<00:02:42.990> of<00:02:43.140> this<00:02:43.320> make

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
based on that sound because of this make

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:45.770 
based on that sound because of this make
sure<00:02:43.890> you<00:02:44.310> keep<00:02:44.520> count<00:02:44.820> of<00:02:45.000> how<00:02:45.060> many<00:02:45.270> rounds

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
sure you keep count of how many rounds

your<00:02:45.870> enemy<00:02:46.230> has<00:02:46.380> if<00:02:46.920> you<00:02:47.790> know<00:02:48.060> that<00:02:48.330> they

only have two or one round left it's a

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:52.520 
only have two or one round left it's a
good<00:02:51.150> idea<00:02:51.240> to<00:02:51.480> wait<00:02:51.870> till<00:02:52.110> they<00:02:52.230> try<00:02:52.470> to

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
good idea to wait till they try to

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.200 
good idea to wait till they try to
reload<00:02:52.920> to<00:02:53.250> engage<00:02:53.610> and<00:02:53.850> catch<00:02:54.000> them

deagle<00:03:02.400> is<00:03:02.610> most<00:03:02.880> efficiently<00:03:03.660> used<00:03:03.990> when

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
deagle is most efficiently used when

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.500 
deagle is most efficiently used when
turning<00:03:04.680> corners<00:03:04.890> at<00:03:05.280> close<00:03:05.520> range<00:03:05.850> this

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
turning corners at close range this

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:09.140 
turning corners at close range this
allows<00:03:06.900> you<00:03:07.110> to<00:03:07.230> pull<00:03:07.410> off<00:03:07.560> those<00:03:07.830> one<00:03:08.430> digs<00:03:08.790> as

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
allows you to pull off those one digs as

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.870 
allows you to pull off those one digs as
they<00:03:09.660> are<00:03:09.780> so-called<00:03:10.280> where<00:03:11.280> you<00:03:11.400> are<00:03:11.520> able<00:03:11.700> to

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
they are so-called where you are able to

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:13.520 
they are so-called where you are able to

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
shoot one shot at your enemy in the head

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:16.220 
shoot one shot at your enemy in the head
and<00:03:13.740> kill<00:03:14.010> them<00:03:14.190> at<00:03:14.660> longer<00:03:15.660> distances<00:03:16.170> and

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
and kill them at longer distances and

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:18.980 
and kill them at longer distances and
with<00:03:16.740> enemies<00:03:17.130> dispersed<00:03:17.670> around<00:03:17.850> the<00:03:18.660> deagle

with enemies dispersed around the deagle

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:21.199 
with enemies dispersed around the deagle
becomes<00:03:19.350> exponentially<00:03:20.280> more<00:03:20.490> difficult<00:03:20.700> to

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
becomes exponentially more difficult to

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:24.140 
becomes exponentially more difficult to
use<00:03:21.240> I<00:03:21.750> would<00:03:22.560> not<00:03:22.920> recommend<00:03:23.340> using<00:03:23.880> the

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
use I would not recommend using the

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.660 
use I would not recommend using the
deagle<00:03:24.450> for<00:03:24.660> long<00:03:24.870> range<00:03:25.140> and<00:03:25.620> only<00:03:26.490> use<00:03:26.640> it

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:26.670 
deagle for long range and only use it

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:29.230 
deagle for long range and only use it
for<00:03:26.820> medium<00:03:27.360> range<00:03:27.570> as<00:03:27.870> a<00:03:27.930> last<00:03:28.380> resort

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:29.240 
for medium range as a last resort

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:32.660 
for medium range as a last resort
remember<00:03:30.240> it's<00:03:30.840> a<00:03:31.080> secondary<00:03:31.590> so<00:03:32.220> it's<00:03:32.370> best

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.670 
remember it's a secondary so it's best

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:34.820 
remember it's a secondary so it's best
to<00:03:32.850> pick<00:03:33.150> up<00:03:33.300> a<00:03:33.420> primary<00:03:34.020> off<00:03:34.260> of<00:03:34.530> the<00:03:34.650> guys

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:34.830 
to pick up a primary off of the guys

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:37.040 
to pick up a primary off of the guys
that<00:03:35.070> you<00:03:35.130> kill<00:03:35.459> and<00:03:35.670> use<00:03:36.120> that<00:03:36.420> to<00:03:36.660> finish<00:03:36.930> the

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:37.050 
that you kill and use that to finish the
