an injured goalie out there right right

00:03:21.149 --> 00:03:21.159 
now i agree but i don't think my guess

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:23.220 
now i agree but i don't think my guess
is<00:03:21.430> that<00:03:21.670> I<00:03:21.939> think<00:03:22.180> the<00:03:22.299> Lorenzo<00:03:22.720> will<00:03:22.900> stay<00:03:23.109> in

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.230 
is that I think the Lorenzo will stay in

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:27.119 
is that I think the Lorenzo will stay in
the<00:03:23.349> game<00:03:23.560> with<00:03:25.140> with<00:03:26.140> this<00:03:26.349> happening<00:03:26.890> but

00:03:27.119 --> 00:03:27.129 
the game with with this happening but

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:29.869 
the game with with this happening but
basically<00:03:27.670> what<00:03:27.970> it'll<00:03:28.209> be<00:03:28.269> is<00:03:28.659> a<00:03:28.989> fight<00:03:29.590> and

00:03:29.869 --> 00:03:29.879 
basically what it'll be is a fight and

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:32.880 
basically what it'll be is a fight and
then<00:03:30.879> when<00:03:31.209> I'm<00:03:31.359> and<00:03:31.810> then<00:03:31.959> probably<00:03:32.590> another

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:32.890 
then when I'm and then probably another

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:35.670 
then when I'm and then probably another
it<00:03:33.250> looks<00:03:33.489> right<00:03:34.420> now<00:03:34.480> what<00:03:34.989> we<00:03:35.109> have<00:03:35.139> is<00:03:35.379> we

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:35.680 
it looks right now what we have is we

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:40.080 
it looks right now what we have is we
have<00:03:35.859> two<00:03:36.370> minutes<00:03:36.700> up<00:03:36.849> against<00:03:37.450> dayton<00:03:38.290> as<00:03:39.090> a

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.090 
have two minutes up against dayton as a

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:42.509 
have two minutes up against dayton as a
two-minute<00:03:40.780> penalty<00:03:41.049> again<00:03:41.799> i<00:03:41.829> assume<00:03:42.400> an

00:03:42.509 --> 00:03:42.519 
two-minute penalty again i assume an

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:44.309 
two-minute penalty again i assume an
additional<00:03:43.060> against<00:03:43.299> maassluis<00:03:43.780> is<00:03:43.989> what<00:03:44.200> i'm

00:03:44.309 --> 00:03:44.319 
additional against maassluis is what i'm

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:46.289 
additional against maassluis is what i'm
guessing<00:03:44.799> probably<00:03:45.760> either<00:03:46.120> an

00:03:46.289 --> 00:03:46.299 
guessing probably either an

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:47.940 
guessing probably either an
unsportsmanlike<00:03:46.690> or<00:03:47.200> an<00:03:47.290> instigator<00:03:47.799> or

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:47.950 
unsportsmanlike or an instigator or

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:53.309 
unsportsmanlike or an instigator or
something<00:03:48.430> to<00:03:48.549> that<00:03:48.579> effect<00:03:49.090> so<00:03:51.239> my<00:03:52.239> right<00:03:53.079> now

00:03:53.309 --> 00:03:53.319 
something to that effect so my right now

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:55.170 
something to that effect so my right now
the<00:03:53.379> way<00:03:53.650> it<00:03:53.769> looks<00:03:53.980> is<00:03:54.189> that<00:03:54.400> the<00:03:54.790> diamond

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:55.180 
the way it looks is that the diamond

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:57.119 
the way it looks is that the diamond
will<00:03:55.359> be<00:03:55.540> on<00:03:55.750> will<00:03:56.170> be<00:03:56.319> killing<00:03:56.650> a<00:03:56.709> penalty

00:03:57.119 --> 00:03:57.129 
will be on will be killing a penalty

00:03:57.129 --> 00:04:01.860 
will be on will be killing a penalty
