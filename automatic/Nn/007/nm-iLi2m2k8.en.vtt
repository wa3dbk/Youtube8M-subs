00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.090 
he kind of brought the concept to me I
mean<00:00:33.360> you<00:00:33.809> probably<00:00:33.989> in<00:00:34.290> case<00:00:34.469> I<00:00:34.680> that's<00:00:34.980> what

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
mean you probably in case I that's what

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.190 
mean you probably in case I that's what
person<00:00:35.399> good<00:00:35.579> before<00:00:35.880> and<00:00:36.180> the<00:00:36.719> whole<00:00:36.840> idea<00:00:36.989> of

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
person good before and the whole idea of

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.670 
person good before and the whole idea of
it<00:00:37.290> is<00:00:37.410> the<00:00:37.860> way<00:00:37.950> sold<00:00:38.190> to<00:00:38.399> me<00:00:38.520> was<00:00:38.760> that<00:00:39.649> what<00:00:40.649> I

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
it is the way sold to me was that what I

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.790 
it is the way sold to me was that what I
do<00:00:40.800> is<00:00:40.950> I<00:00:41.129> would<00:00:41.960> there<00:00:42.960> was<00:00:43.050> no<00:00:43.200> risk<00:00:43.410> for<00:00:43.680> me

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
do is I would there was no risk for me

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:44.900 
do is I would there was no risk for me
because<00:00:44.100> I<00:00:44.190> was<00:00:44.280> like<00:00:44.370> well<00:00:44.550> I'm<00:00:44.640> not<00:00:44.730> going<00:00:44.850> to

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
because I was like well I'm not going to

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.670 
because I was like well I'm not going to
do<00:00:45.090> it<00:00:45.239> but<00:00:45.510> basically<00:00:45.719> what<00:00:46.079> the<00:00:46.350> highline

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
do it but basically what the highline

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.610 
do it but basically what the highline
idea<00:00:46.950> is<00:00:47.100> if<00:00:47.390> whoever<00:00:48.390> wins<00:00:48.660> gets<00:00:48.899> gets<00:00:49.530> to

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
idea is if whoever wins gets gets to

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:50.900 
idea is if whoever wins gets gets to
choose<00:00:49.649> one<00:00:50.100> player<00:00:50.280> from<00:00:50.399> the<00:00:50.730> other

for<00:01:38.040> it<00:01:38.340> you<00:01:38.759> should<00:01:38.939> never<00:01:39.090> finish<00:01:39.479> hole<00:01:39.689> and

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
for it you should never finish hole and

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.240

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.880 
they do that year old powershot it
because<00:01:42.180> if<00:01:42.299> you<00:01:42.420> financial<00:01:42.899> the<00:01:43.409> keepers

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
because if you financial the keepers

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.530 
because if you financial the keepers
generally<00:01:44.280> get<00:01:44.430> hand<00:01:44.700> to<00:01:44.909> it<00:01:45.030> and<00:01:45.180> they'll

generally get hand to it and they'll

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.840 
generally get hand to it and they'll
save<00:01:45.810> it<00:01:46.020> so<00:01:46.229> that's<00:01:47.040> how<00:01:47.159> i<00:01:47.189> started<00:01:47.310> to<00:01:47.640> start

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
save it so that's how i started to start

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.020 
save it so that's how i started to start
off<00:01:47.970> with<00:01:48.119> me<00:01:48.270> scoring<00:01:48.750> one<00:01:49.110> nil<00:01:49.320> and<00:01:49.920> i<00:01:50.700> should

and I was gonna just protect the lead
but<00:04:33.660> I<00:04:33.750> was<00:04:33.870> like<00:04:33.990> I<00:04:34.260> why<00:04:34.860> should<00:04:35.040> do<00:04:35.190> is<00:04:35.310> go<00:04:35.340> for

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:35.550 
but I was like I why should do is go for

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:38.030 
but I was like I why should do is go for
another<00:04:35.669> goal<00:04:36.120> and<00:04:36.410> then<00:04:37.410> that<00:04:37.650> would<00:04:37.800> allow

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:38.040 
another goal and then that would allow

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:12.930 
to think at this point we've got 11

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:15.070 
to think at this point we've got 11
goals<00:05:13.380> we've<00:05:13.590> still<00:05:13.800> got<00:05:13.919> two<00:05:14.160> more<00:05:14.190> to<00:05:14.490> go<00:05:14.520> oh

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:17.490

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:19.740 
Vincent Kompany sent off earlier in the

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:21.529 
Vincent Kompany sent off earlier in the
game<00:05:19.770> but<00:05:20.220> he<00:05:20.280> changed<00:05:20.550> the<00:05:20.580> formation<00:05:21.000> 2352

00:05:21.529 --> 00:05:21.539 
game but he changed the formation 2352

00:05:21.539 --> 00:05:23.510 
game but he changed the formation 2352
so<00:05:22.320> it<00:05:22.470> made<00:05:22.800> it<00:05:22.830> really<00:05:23.010> difficult<00:05:23.130> for<00:05:23.430> me
