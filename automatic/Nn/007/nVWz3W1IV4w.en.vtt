00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
been impressed with it so far i have

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:34.550 
been impressed with it so far i have
three<00:01:28.920> guy<00:01:29.100> wires<00:01:31.220> and<00:01:32.240> i<00:01:33.240> actually<00:01:33.659> put<00:01:33.869> these

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
three guy wires and i actually put these

adjustment<00:01:35.450> i'm<00:01:36.450> not<00:01:36.600> sure<00:01:36.750> what<00:01:36.840> they're

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
adjustment i'm not sure what they're

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.649 
adjustment i'm not sure what they're
called<00:01:37.229> tensioners<00:01:38.189> i<00:01:38.310> guess<00:01:38.520> right<00:01:39.450> here

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
called tensioners i guess right here

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.710 
called tensioners i guess right here
where<00:01:40.409> you<00:01:40.530> can<00:01:40.680> loosen<00:01:41.159> it<00:01:41.310> tighten<00:01:42.119> it<00:01:42.210> just

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
where you can loosen it tighten it just

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.450 
where you can loosen it tighten it just
by<00:01:42.840> pulling<00:01:43.079> the<00:01:43.229> string<00:01:43.560> or<00:01:43.740> you<00:01:44.159> know<00:01:44.250> this

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
by pulling the string or you know this

the kids actually Disney antenna right
there<00:02:26.960> I've<00:02:27.960> it<00:02:28.170> laying<00:02:28.350> down<00:02:29.150> so<00:02:30.150> I'm<00:02:30.900> going

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
there I've it laying down so I'm going

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:32.480 
there I've it laying down so I'm going
to<00:02:31.080> put<00:02:31.170> it<00:02:31.320> in<00:02:31.440> here<00:02:31.560> run<00:02:31.770> the<00:02:31.890> radials<00:02:32.280> down

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:32.490 
to put it in here run the radials down

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:34.550 
to put it in here run the radials down
that<00:02:32.880> way<00:02:33.060> and<00:02:33.870> through<00:02:34.080> the<00:02:34.170> other<00:02:34.290> side<00:02:34.380> of

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
that way and through the other side of

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:40.100 
that way and through the other side of
the<00:02:34.710> house<00:02:35.240> so<00:02:36.350> the<00:02:37.350> hex<00:02:37.560> beam<00:02:37.800> is<00:02:38.900> the<00:02:39.900> one

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
the house so the hex beam is the one

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.440 
the house so the hex beam is the one
that<00:02:40.260> I<00:02:40.320> i<00:02:40.770> purchase<00:02:41.610> I'm<00:02:41.730> going<00:02:41.880> to<00:02:41.940> swing<00:02:42.330> you

that I i purchase I'm going to swing you
around<00:02:42.480> here<00:02:42.810> is<00:02:43.459> 15<00:02:44.510> 17<00:02:45.510> and<00:02:45.780> 20<00:02:46.650> meters<00:02:47.370> I

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
around here is 15 17 and 20 meters I

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.199 
around here is 15 17 and 20 meters I
will<00:02:49.560> eventually<00:02:49.860> get<00:02:50.190> the<00:02:50.370> 10<00:02:50.610> in<00:02:50.760> the<00:02:50.910> in<00:02:51.180> the

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
will eventually get the 10 in the in the

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:53.120 
will eventually get the 10 in the in the
12<00:02:51.630> actually<00:02:52.050> they<00:02:52.110> make<00:02:52.260> us<00:02:52.380> 64<00:02:52.770> this<00:02:52.890> so<00:02:53.040> you

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
12 actually they make us 64 this so you

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:55.910 
12 actually they make us 64 this so you
have<00:02:53.250> to<00:02:53.370> really<00:02:53.700> see<00:02:53.970> how<00:02:54.090> it<00:02:54.209> works<00:02:54.800> but<00:02:55.800> this

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
have to really see how it works but this

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:00.680 
have to really see how it works but this
road<00:02:56.130> works<00:02:56.430> really<00:02:56.640> well<00:02:56.730> with<00:02:57.060> this<00:02:58.520> and<00:02:59.690> I

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
road works really well with this and I

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:02.210 
road works really well with this and I
am<00:03:01.020> going<00:03:01.140> to<00:03:01.230> i<00:03:01.410> have<00:03:01.560> to<00:03:01.680> take<00:03:01.800> it<00:03:01.950> down<00:03:02.070> to

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
am going to i have to take it down to

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.449 
am going to i have to take it down to
put<00:03:02.340> another<00:03:02.600> bolt<00:03:03.600> through<00:03:03.870> it<00:03:04.280> right<00:03:05.280> with

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
put another bolt through it right with

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:08.840 
put another bolt through it right with
that<00:03:05.490> base<00:03:06.390> plate<00:03:06.660> is<00:03:06.840> the<00:03:07.490> one<00:03:08.490> that<00:03:08.610> i<00:03:08.640> have

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
that base plate is the one that i have

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:10.790 
that base plate is the one that i have
in<00:03:09.030> there<00:03:09.150> I'm<00:03:09.240> just<00:03:09.390> I'm<00:03:10.110> a<00:03:10.170> little<00:03:10.260> wary<00:03:10.620> of

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:10.800 
in there I'm just I'm a little wary of

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.310 
in there I'm just I'm a little wary of
it<00:03:11.040> and<00:03:11.220> the<00:03:12.209> winters<00:03:12.510> that<00:03:12.690> we<00:03:12.810> have<00:03:12.959> here<00:03:13.140> and

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:13.320 
it and the winters that we have here and

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:17.870 
it and the winters that we have here and
in<00:03:14.250> New<00:03:14.370> England<00:03:14.700> can<00:03:14.880> be<00:03:14.910> held<00:03:16.580> and<00:03:17.580> with<00:03:17.760> the

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880 
in New England can be held and with the

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.729 
in New England can be held and with the
wind<00:03:18.060> and<00:03:18.209> all<00:03:18.690> the<00:03:18.959> Nor'easters<00:03:19.470> that<00:03:19.620> we

wind and all the Nor'easters that we

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:20.960 
wind and all the Nor'easters that we
have<00:03:19.860> that<00:03:19.980> come<00:03:20.160> up<00:03:20.280> here<00:03:20.430> so<00:03:20.580> i<00:03:20.640> am<00:03:20.760> going<00:03:20.910> to

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
have that come up here so i am going to

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:24.620 
have that come up here so i am going to
put<00:03:21.180> another<00:03:21.480> one<00:03:21.660> through<00:03:23.150> but<00:03:24.150> if<00:03:24.480> you're

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 
put another one through but if you're

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:27.710 
put another one through but if you're
looking<00:03:24.660> at<00:03:24.930> a<00:03:24.989> hex<00:03:25.200> be<00:03:25.350> my<00:03:25.530> recommended<00:03:26.720> the

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
looking at a hex be my recommended the

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.360 
looking at a hex be my recommended the
DX<00:03:28.050> comes<00:03:28.320> in<00:03:28.470> a<00:03:28.530> whole<00:03:28.680> hell<00:03:28.860> of<00:03:28.890> a<00:03:29.040> lot<00:03:29.070> better

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
DX comes in a whole hell of a lot better

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:31.250 
DX comes in a whole hell of a lot better
because<00:03:29.550> i<00:03:29.700> have<00:03:29.880> compared<00:03:30.360> took<00:03:31.110> that

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
because i have compared took that

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.460 
because i have compared took that
vertical<00:03:31.680> down<00:03:31.860> today<00:03:32.070> and<00:03:33.320> flipping<00:03:34.320> back

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 
vertical down today and flipping back

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:37.970 
vertical down today and flipping back
between<00:03:34.680> it<00:03:35.540> obviously<00:03:36.540> it's<00:03:36.720> a<00:03:36.980> significant

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
between it obviously it's a significant

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:41.000 
between it obviously it's a significant
difference<00:03:38.810> you<00:03:39.810> know<00:03:39.870> stateside<00:03:40.380> it's<00:03:40.739> it's

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
difference you know stateside it's it's

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:43.880 
difference you know stateside it's it's
hit<00:03:41.160> or<00:03:41.190> miss<00:03:41.310> sometimes<00:03:41.580> it<00:03:42.060> really<00:03:42.180> is<00:03:42.890> now

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:43.890 
hit or miss sometimes it really is now

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:46.970 
hit or miss sometimes it really is now
as<00:03:44.190> I<00:03:44.310> spin<00:03:44.549> around<00:03:45.170> stations<00:03:46.170> come<00:03:46.560> it'll<00:03:46.709> you

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 
as I spin around stations come it'll you

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:48.620 
as I spin around stations come it'll you
know<00:03:47.010> obviously<00:03:47.549> if<00:03:48.000> you're<00:03:48.090> in<00:03:48.390> the<00:03:48.480> wrong

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:48.630 
know obviously if you're in the wrong

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:50.030 
know obviously if you're in the wrong
direction<00:03:48.870> and<00:03:49.260> not<00:03:49.440> going<00:03:49.590> to<00:03:49.680> come<00:03:49.799> in<00:03:49.890> but

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
direction and not going to come in but

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.740 
direction and not going to come in but
sometimes<00:03:50.730> the<00:03:50.880> vertical<00:03:51.269> actually<00:03:51.570> does

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
sometimes the vertical actually does

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:54.500 
sometimes the vertical actually does
pick<00:03:51.959> up<00:03:52.110> stuff<00:03:52.290> a<00:03:52.440> little<00:03:52.530> bit<00:03:52.739> better<00:03:53.510> but

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:54.510 
pick up stuff a little bit better but

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:56.570 
pick up stuff a little bit better but
not<00:03:54.570> that<00:03:54.840> often<00:03:55.110> once<00:03:55.799> i<00:03:55.950> stop<00:03:56.160> pointing<00:03:56.459> this

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:56.580 
not that often once i stop pointing this

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:59.479 
not that often once i stop pointing this
bad<00:03:56.790> boy<00:03:56.970> adam<00:03:57.360> they<00:03:58.200> seem<00:03:58.860> to<00:03:58.890> pop<00:03:59.130> in<00:03:59.310> on<00:03:59.400> the

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:01.410 
hell of a lot better so but that's just

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:03.110 
hell of a lot better so but that's just
a<00:04:01.560> quick<00:04:01.709> look<00:04:01.980> at<00:04:02.100> what<00:04:02.130> what's<00:04:02.730> going<00:04:02.970> on
