00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.700
 The subject we are going to follow now is 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:08.760
 Rational dressage of Creole horses 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:11.490
 our team followed a taming course 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:17.010
 rational and body language 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:21.020
 follow ethos ethos report of the 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:26.220
 Greek means character personality 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:27.750
 custom geology behavior wants 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.810
 say study 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:35.070
 so we understand by and technology the 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:37.290
 study of behavior in horses 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.809
 Creoles is this technology that is 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:44.700
 used in the course of rational dressing 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:46.110
 body language enjoy the 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.120
 animal behavior and create a 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.039
 fellowship with man are these 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.149
 main fundamentals in this course 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:54.660
 rational dressage 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:57.000
 then the man becomes a partner a 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:00.059
 friend and form a pair of two friends 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.010
 where the man through his posture beyond 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.290
 of this friend is the leader of the horse a 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.700
 horse ends up following man and leaving 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.040
 that he does what he wants 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.810
 So it's a girl sent one without 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.810
 that the horse is very advanced. 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:15.420
 fast a natural docile and as the name 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:18.360
 rational already consists of a 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.790
 sequence of specific exercises 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:24.960
 some examples are pressure by hand 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:27.900
 in the room give in to pressure and a.madrid 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:32.520
 I regret that the horse was extinct follows 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:35.490
 man is made inside the hose and 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:38.060
 Also in the open field always taking 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:41.100
 attention to synchronization and safety 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:43.740
 is also prominent in rational dressing the 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:46.619
 rask tail that nothing is more than to brush 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:49.170
 the horse naturally resorts 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:51.329
 rub each other in the field while doing 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.610
 that man creates greater intimacy 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:56.430
 with the animal and has the confidence 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:59.040
 of it and one of the fundamental differences 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:01.290
 of this rational dressing is the use of this 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.360
 embouchure here the bridle in the other type 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.610
 of pain but if a leather mouthpiece is made 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.259
 the so-called jaw breaks as toast the 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:10.649
 animal to become accustomed to the few with this 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:12.360
 articulated iron bar in the mouth and guru 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:14.310
 is foreman 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.920
 even accustomed to working with the 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:19.920
 horse training and provided 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:22.140
 a new vision have already dealt with horse there 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.570
 long time and I have always worked in a 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.460
 tradition is totally different here 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:28.410
 We talk with the horse. 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:29.880
 accustomed it to the movements of the 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:32.670
 people to people used to the 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:34.700
 movement is this language that made 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:37.650
 What do you do with a veterinary student? 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:40.020
 and enchant with the method 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:42.810
 I love riding since I was little since I was 4 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:45.420
 years of age and I felt that in 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:47.760
 The veterinarian was missing a 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:50.489
 the language of the horse and how to 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.270
 arrive and how to leave the horse quiet 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:53.130
 with us 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:54.810
 I think it's more or less why I 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:57.180
 I tried this style don am 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:03:01.140
 adoring loving in love with the mare 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:03.750
 by course by all method of dressing 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:06.480
 using the technology is innovative and 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:08.489
 this sometimes leads to doubts 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.650
 Do not worry, we'll talk to your 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:12.000
 new for decades is worker 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:13.140
 instance 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.250
 he rides on tamed horses 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:21.600
 rationally and guarantees the dressage there 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:23.910
 stains more horses on the college entrance 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:26.850
 uff is a normal thing from any other 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:33.269
 reader who is the type of dressage 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:36.390
 rational is greater and more trust 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:40.110
 in the garden face is doing that 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:42.870
 resource already since 2000 is what leads 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:48.269
 to do to follow today in front with 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:49.980
 this project is a passion 13 years 

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:52.500
 are about 300 sets 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:56.100
 horse / rider who passed here and 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:58.320
 always succeeded with tranquility and the 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:00.840
 end always an extraordinary end the 

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:02.459
 people fall in love and a 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:05.360
 a method that allows anyone 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:08.220
 of any age with experience or not 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:11.220
 rural society that was born on the 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:13.799
 horse was born in the city at last 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:15.780
 any age it can advance its 

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:18.169
 horse and enjoy the pleasures that the
