been experimenting with the other blades
and<00:01:31.770> for<00:01:31.890> some<00:01:32.039> reason<00:01:32.070> I<00:01:32.429> just<00:01:32.460> tend<00:01:32.850> to<00:01:32.940> like

00:01:33.139 --> 00:01:33.149 
and for some reason I just tend to like

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:35.990 
and for some reason I just tend to like
the<00:01:33.240> 13s<00:01:33.810> better<00:01:34.610> just<00:01:35.610> four<00:01:35.789> straight

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
the 13s better just four straight

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.570 
the 13s better just four straight
overall<00:01:36.270> speed<00:01:36.660> and<00:01:37.160> you<00:01:38.160> know<00:01:38.280> that's<00:01:38.399> pretty

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:38.580 
overall speed and you know that's pretty

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:39.950 
overall speed and you know that's pretty
much<00:01:38.759> the<00:01:39.060> only<00:01:39.179> reason<00:01:39.479> why<00:01:39.600> I<00:01:39.630> would<00:01:39.810> use

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
much the only reason why I would use

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.109 
much the only reason why I would use
that<00:01:40.160> you<00:01:41.160> know<00:01:41.280> the<00:01:41.399> Elevens<00:01:41.789> are<00:01:41.850> good<00:01:42.000> in

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
that you know the Elevens are good in

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.169 
that you know the Elevens are good in
between<00:01:42.479> but<00:01:42.869> the<00:01:43.710> nine<00:01:43.890> is<00:01:44.159> just<00:01:44.399> my<00:01:45.000> guys

00:01:45.169 --> 00:01:45.179 
between but the nine is just my guys

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:47.690 
between but the nine is just my guys
slows<00:01:45.450> down<00:01:45.600> just<00:01:45.840> way<00:01:46.080> way<00:01:46.979> way<00:01:47.190> way<00:01:47.369> way<00:01:47.550> way

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
slows down just way way way way way way

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.100 
slows down just way way way way way way
way<00:01:47.880> too<00:01:47.909> much<00:01:48.270> so<00:01:49.460> that's<00:01:50.460> it<00:01:50.640> there<00:01:51.050> and<00:01:52.050> then

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
way too much so that's it there and then

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.020 
way too much so that's it there and then
change<00:01:52.500> anything<00:01:52.800> but<00:01:53.250> just<00:01:53.399> in<00:01:53.550> case<00:01:53.580> I'll

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
change anything but just in case I'll

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.050 
change anything but just in case I'll
discard

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.060 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:02.010

stuff<00:04:27.250> out<00:04:27.460> and<00:04:27.700> putting<00:04:28.240> it<00:04:28.390> more<00:04:28.510> in<00:04:28.570> a<00:04:28.600> body

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:28.810 
stuff out and putting it more in a body

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:30.330 
stuff out and putting it more in a body
checking<00:04:29.320> because<00:04:29.440> I<00:04:29.590> do<00:04:29.650> love<00:04:29.770> to<00:04:30.040> hit<00:04:30.190> but

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:30.340 
checking because I do love to hit but

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:32.340 
checking because I do love to hit but
look<00:04:30.460> how<00:04:30.550> much<00:04:30.669> it<00:04:30.850> cost<00:04:31.060> I<00:04:31.480> mean<00:04:32.080> if<00:04:32.230> I'm

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:32.350 
look how much it cost I mean if I'm

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:34.470 
look how much it cost I mean if I'm
using<00:04:32.440> a<00:04:32.620> power<00:04:32.860> forward<00:04:33.150> it's<00:04:34.150> not<00:04:34.300> going<00:04:34.390> to

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:34.480 
using a power forward it's not going to

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:36.720 
using a power forward it's not going to
cost<00:04:34.630> that<00:04:34.900> much<00:04:35.050> but<00:04:35.440> you<00:04:36.160> know<00:04:36.280> I<00:04:36.310> like<00:04:36.520> to<00:04:36.640> be

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:36.730 
cost that much but you know I like to be

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:42.720 
cost that much but you know I like to be
the<00:04:36.820> playmaker<00:04:38.880> athleticism<00:04:41.669> actually<00:04:42.669> I

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:42.730 
the playmaker athleticism actually I

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:44.340 
the playmaker athleticism actually I
don't<00:04:42.880> know<00:04:43.090> if<00:04:43.150> I<00:04:43.210> put<00:04:43.390> no<00:04:43.570> I<00:04:43.600> did<00:04:43.780> many<00:04:43.930> pluses

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:44.350 
don't know if I put no I did many pluses

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:47.760 
don't know if I put no I did many pluses
in<00:04:44.380> my<00:04:44.650> defense<00:04:45.070> but<00:04:45.340> I<00:04:45.370> athleticism<00:04:46.210> 12<00:04:46.770> and

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:47.770 
in my defense but I athleticism 12 and

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:50.280 
in my defense but I athleticism 12 and
acceleration<00:04:48.550> 12<00:04:48.820> new<00:04:49.000> agility<00:04:49.360> and<00:04:49.540> 12<00:04:49.870> into

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:50.290 
acceleration 12 new agility and 12 into

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:54.780 
acceleration 12 new agility and 12 into
speed<00:04:50.650> um<00:04:50.890> I<00:04:53.310> experimented<00:04:54.310> a<00:04:54.520> lot<00:04:54.730> with

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:54.790 
speed um I experimented a lot with

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:56.250 
speed um I experimented a lot with
different<00:04:55.270> stuff<00:04:55.480> to<00:04:55.600> see<00:04:55.750> how<00:04:55.930> much<00:04:56.110> I<00:04:56.230> can

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:56.260 
different stuff to see how much I can

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.080 
different stuff to see how much I can
max<00:04:56.590> this<00:04:56.800> and<00:04:56.980> actually<00:04:57.130> it<00:04:57.430> worked<00:04:57.790> out<00:04:57.940> the

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:58.090 
max this and actually it worked out the

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:00.120 
max this and actually it worked out the
best<00:04:58.270> this<00:04:58.480> way<00:04:58.690> um<00:04:59.230> you<00:04:59.440> know<00:04:59.560> see<00:04:59.740> Mike<00:04:59.919> put

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:00.130 
best this way um you know see Mike put

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:01.740 
best this way um you know see Mike put
some<00:05:00.280> stuff<00:05:00.460> you<00:05:00.970> know<00:05:01.090> putting<00:05:01.270> pluses<00:05:01.720> in

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:01.750 
some stuff you know putting pluses in

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:03.180 
some stuff you know putting pluses in
the<00:05:01.930> strength<00:05:02.230> and<00:05:02.470> see<00:05:02.650> if<00:05:02.830> I<00:05:02.950> can<00:05:03.130> get

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:03.190 
the strength and see if I can get

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:05.130 
the strength and see if I can get
anything<00:05:03.430> else<00:05:03.580> higher<00:05:03.880> but<00:05:04.300> seeing<00:05:05.080> that

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:05.140 
anything else higher but seeing that

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:10.020 
anything else higher but seeing that
this<00:05:05.350> was<00:05:05.530> the<00:05:05.620> best<00:05:05.770> option<00:05:08.640> 90<00:05:09.640> overall

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:10.030 
this was the best option 90 overall

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:12.510 
this was the best option 90 overall
something<00:05:10.570> max<00:05:10.990> down<00:05:11.260> acceleration<00:05:11.950> maxed

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:12.520 
something max down acceleration maxed

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:14.520

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:14.530 
out an agility put my balance up a bit

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:17.100 
out an agility put my balance up a bit
