00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:13.679
 nice guys here and net we're back in 

00:00:10.589 --> 00:00:16.740
 a new ghost video where I will make you 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:19.290
 see my class that I use when I have to 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.690
 do here fuck with the sniper we leave well 

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:26.130
 immediately we go to the 3rd soldier and eto'o 

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:32.189
 jesus god jesus suffered on sniper 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:34.260
 you see that use usr usr because it has the 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.170
 greater mobility than others 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.630
 two snipers and then run faster 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:45.720
 and aim faster so it's great as 

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:48.720
 weapon as an accessory I use pro natura that 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:52.190
 increases to damage because maybe patick 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:56.520
 marker thanks to this accessory 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:58.190
 avoid these it marks then use the 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.890
 eyes jo least one is said 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:05.100
 bought it for sure how 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:07.700
 secondary I don't use anything however it is 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.799
 indifferent any weapon used 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:15.859
 take away with boys not with her 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:15.859
 I use at least more points for the specialties 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:21.209
 now I will make you the specialties 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:23.759
 see now that I choose and I am from 

00:01:21.209 --> 00:01:25.560
 sure quick extraction because i 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:28.350
 allows you to aim faster with 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.929
 cecchi in fundamentals then predator 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.090
 which allows you to move faster 

00:01:30.929 --> 00:01:35.969
 while you aim then this too is 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:39.029
 fundamental stable aim plus increases the 

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:40.889
 accuracy then the probability of 

00:01:39.029 --> 00:01:43.549
 hit an enemy 

00:01:40.889 --> 00:01:45.779
 then I put the magic trick that 

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:47.939
 will allow you to load faster and 

00:01:45.779 --> 00:01:50.249
 readiness, that is, after one click , he never has it 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:52.920
 ready more quickly 

00:01:50.249 --> 00:01:54.689
 well indeed with these because of the sniper 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.439
 it will be much easier than before 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:59.369
 logically you need to train a little but 

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:02.189
 it will be much simpler 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:03.719
 then if you want more bonuses the advice 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:06.869
 use specialist and I recommend you 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:09.950
 use over of marathon agility as well 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:11.310
 you will be really fast and then caesar 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:17.150
 concentration 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:23.670
 and these are the first ones then you then then 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:28.860
 use them as you don't have them all for that 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:32.610
 we advise that the cv have recovered hear 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:35.730
 faster then riding here 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:38.880
 the others are these from there and then 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:40.769
 indifferent was still existing 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:45.239
 however the fundamentals are these here 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:46.739
 and rosettes and no kids there 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:48.780
 they held the next tutorial there 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:52.170
 I will explain better how to do here scott 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:54.269
 This was a short video shown 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:58.700
 just the class and nothing see you at 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:58.700
