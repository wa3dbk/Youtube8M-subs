00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:06.779
 good morning everyone I have returned I am 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.820
 I reboot here and I'm happy because I do not 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.410
 a video for a long time and I know 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.450
 who have not been able to watch my videos 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.400
 old post to which they afflicted me and 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.440
 deleted the videos and good the subject of 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.320
 Today is top 10 dragon ball z games 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.210
 good for this I'll call alive good 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.279
 came on fire ah but before you start 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.550
 I will tell you that in the top there will be no games 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.990
 of play station 1 or 2 2 or 3 and xbox or 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.609
 be that if we only talk about the 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.609
 portable consoles and super nintendo 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:39.519
 placed number 10 of the legacy of goku this 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:41.559
 game is in rpg format this game 

00:00:39.519 --> 00:00:43.420
 have a good one that you can pass the saga 

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:45.339
 there are already gynes to offer 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:47.620
 but you also have the bad thing you just play 

00:00:45.339 --> 00:00:50.050
 with goku without itching or others 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:51.940
 also the gameplay is medium slow to the 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:53.829
 principle the other disadvantage is that 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:55.629
 you pass stories that did not happen in the 

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:57.940
 series that would come to do the filling 

00:00:55.629 --> 00:01:00.100
 the game since from radix to 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.530
 grow are very few episodes so 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:06.100
 they filled it out but from 1 to 10 I put it 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:08.259
 a 6 place number 9 dragon ball z super 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:10.300
 legendary and neighborhoods this game is very 

00:01:08.259 --> 00:01:12.819
 good since if you play with itch or 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:14.979
 one etcetera from napa to here the 

00:01:12.819 --> 00:01:17.200
 game is entertaining disadvantages what 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:19.240
 only would be the bad graphics put 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.009
 that battles are not to press 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:23.229
 but to choose the attacks of 

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:25.479
 movements there are difficult parts but 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:27.549
 that does not mean you leave it put 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:30.330
 to what makes it exciting from 1 to 10 it 

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:30.330
 I put an 8 

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:38.780
 put 7 supersonic burned 1 and 2 this 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:41.120
 game is in battle format here the 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.980
 stories are secondary since the 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:44.750
 stories are divided into 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:46.820
 characters what makes them 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.830
 secondary stories the game was 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:51.080
 created for the game boy finished for 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:53.030
 the nintendo ds the two games that will make 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:55.070
 have a good time what makes it 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:57.080
 entertained in the 2 you can use 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:58.880
 I support what I liked most about this game 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:01.130
 was that instead of putting a bike hand 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.440
 they put bardot but support still 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:06.950
 it's very funny from 1 to 10 I put a 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:09.050
 7 place 6 dragon ball z the legacy of 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:11.540
 goku 2 this is the second installment of 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:13.520
 bz the legacy of goku a this version is 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.860
 much better than the previous post to that 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:18.590
 you use goku trunks one vegeta ipyc 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:20.660
 gold and extra m &amp; r satan this time it 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.280
 try to pay this game will make you pass it 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:24.350
 better since in the whole game 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:27.020
 you will have two long mini missions that are 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:29.180
 find the 7 in amex and the 25 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:31.460
 capsules to find the 7 do not strip me 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:33.890
 to fight against kÃ¶hler this game has 

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:36.080
 very little filling this is faster 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:38.240
 to use the phases are great the only thing 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:40.010
 bad is a misery that is just fights 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:43.220
 with 36 jrr 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:45.650
 from there everything I got from 1 to 10 law we 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:47.750
 we approach the 5 best that come to 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:49.970
 the 9 or 10 postscript points I return to 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:53.659
 repeat here you will not find the games 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:56.140
 of pspv that wanted ps2 or xbox put to 

00:02:53.659 --> 00:02:58.909
 that would be filled with pure budokai let's continue 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:01.159
 position number 5 dragon ball advanced 

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:03.019
 adventure gameplay is great raisins 

00:03:01.159 --> 00:03:04.810
 from when you meet bulma to the 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:07.159
 king itch or after weigh history 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:09.170
 you will unlock the story mode but with 

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:11.180
 Krillin and the other characters that you will go 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:13.220
 unlocked by passing such story 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:15.079
 as it says the name is in format 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:17.510
 adventure and fight this game that will do 

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:20.750
 have a very long time from 1 to 10 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:22.790
 I put a 9 place number 4 dragon 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:24.799
 ball origins 2 and a good here happens 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:27.019
 since you know bulma to the end 

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:28.819
 of the red patrol in this game is very 

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:31.099
 exciting position that you're looking for 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:33.349
 spheres and tournaments and you can play in 

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:35.659
 wifi mode that is much better this game 

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:38.090
 it is very entertaining will make you stay in 

00:03:35.659 --> 00:03:40.579
 the machine or nintendo ds more than a month 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:43.290
 if I so far not finished or 1 

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:45.420
 and the 2 from 1 to 10 I put a 9 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:47.849
 put three bronze dragon medals 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:49.859
 ball z goku of sex this game is in 

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:51.780
 format pela de cartas the story takes 

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:53.819
 from rabbits to ace and this game will 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:55.590
 will take a long time since 

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:57.870
 in each play a new fight will be 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:00.150
 moments where you wish you were 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:03.140
 with the letter I recommend it from 1 to 10 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:03.140
 I put a 9 

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:11.540
 put a gold medal dragon ball z 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:13.760
 ultimate button in a fighting game 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:16.100
 similar to a tenkaichi budokai and that 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:17.810
 Sea dragon ball z kai does not mean that 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:19.640
 be it until the face saga this game 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:21.860
 comes to the saga of ma jin bu what 

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:23.630
 I like the most is that their fillings are 

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:25.820
 funny things there are only three movies 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:27.860
 bard that the father of goku goya ni 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:29.630
 trunks the only warriors and both 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:31.670
 broli movies almost every 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:33.830
 characters are usable the three 

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:37.480
 specials are bards vrolijk ay osama 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:37.480
