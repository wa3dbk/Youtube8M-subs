the baby maker it makes people young and
with<00:03:31.139> the<00:03:31.260> upgraded<00:03:31.650> it<00:03:32.010> would<00:03:32.129> make<00:03:32.280> a<00:03:32.489> person

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
with the upgraded it would make a person

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.330 
with the upgraded it would make a person
young<00:03:33.419> now<00:03:34.169> there<00:03:34.530> you<00:03:34.560> see<00:03:34.799> the<00:03:34.829> focusing

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
young now there you see the focusing

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.129 
young now there you see the focusing
stone<00:03:35.459> it's<00:03:35.760> a<00:03:35.849> shrunk<00:03:36.209> media<00:03:36.629> or<00:03:36.780> due<00:03:36.930> to<00:03:36.959> the

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:37.139 
stone it's a shrunk media or due to the

00:03:37.139 --> 00:03:40.699 
stone it's a shrunk media or due to the
baby<00:03:37.379> gun<00:03:37.680> so<00:03:38.189> that<00:03:39.169> focusing<00:03:40.169> stone<00:03:40.349> actually

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:40.709 
baby gun so that focusing stone actually

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:42.770 
baby gun so that focusing stone actually
has<00:03:40.829> the<00:03:40.859> baby<00:03:41.129> gun<00:03:41.519> technology<00:03:41.790> in<00:03:42.359> it<00:03:42.509> that's

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
has the baby gun technology in it that's

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:46.670 
has the baby gun technology in it that's
why<00:03:43.019> I'm<00:03:43.139> saying<00:03:43.409> this<00:03:44.239> that's<00:03:45.239> why<00:03:45.680> focusing

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680 
why I'm saying this that's why focusing

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.050 
why I'm saying this that's why focusing
someone<00:03:46.949> isn't<00:03:47.069> something<00:03:47.459> itself<00:03:47.849> it's<00:03:48.000> a

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
someone isn't something itself it's a

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:51.170 
someone isn't something itself it's a
115<00:03:48.599> meat-eor<00:03:49.019> but<00:03:49.590> that<00:03:49.859> put<00:03:50.310> together<00:03:50.519> with

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
115 meat-eor but that put together with

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:54.170 
115 meat-eor but that put together with
the<00:03:51.389> baby<00:03:51.689> on<00:03:51.810> basically<00:03:52.470> made<00:03:53.310> the<00:03:53.729> focusing

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
the baby on basically made the focusing

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:55.369 
the baby on basically made the focusing
stone<00:03:54.389> which<00:03:54.659> would<00:03:54.840> help<00:03:54.959> you<00:03:55.139> look<00:03:55.319> for
