now this here is a TVs n digital TV
receiver<00:00:04.980> very<00:00:05.880> small<00:00:06.260> pocket-sized<00:00:07.309> liking

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
receiver very small pocket-sized liking

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:11.810 
receiver very small pocket-sized liking
it<00:00:08.400> so<00:00:08.610> far<00:00:08.639> it's<00:00:09.120> as<00:00:09.719> you<00:00:09.870> can<00:00:09.990> see<00:00:10.169> a<00:00:10.820> lot

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
it so far it's as you can see a lot

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.029 
it so far it's as you can see a lot
smaller<00:00:12.120> than<00:00:12.209> the<00:00:12.389> galaxy<00:00:12.749> s2<00:00:12.900> here<00:00:13.440> what<00:00:13.950> it

00:00:14.029 --> 00:00:14.039 
smaller than the galaxy s2 here what it

00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:16.670 
smaller than the galaxy s2 here what it
basically<00:00:14.160> does<00:00:14.429> is<00:00:14.910> it<00:00:15.629> receives<00:00:16.170> TV

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
basically does is it receives TV

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.910 
basically does is it receives TV
pictures<00:00:17.100> TV<00:00:17.790> signals<00:00:18.270> should<00:00:18.450> I<00:00:18.480> say<00:00:18.920> through

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
pictures TV signals should I say through

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.650 
pictures TV signals should I say through
this<00:00:20.070> aerial<00:00:20.460> here<00:00:20.670> which<00:00:20.820> extends<00:00:21.330> out<00:00:21.480> and

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
this aerial here which extends out and

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.900 
this aerial here which extends out and
bends<00:00:22.170> to<00:00:22.740> get<00:00:22.860> the<00:00:22.950> best<00:00:23.130> reception<00:00:23.430> so<00:00:23.820> I'll

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
bends to get the best reception so I'll

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.900 
bends to get the best reception so I'll
just<00:00:24.120> pop<00:00:24.360> that<00:00:24.390> out<00:00:24.570> here<00:00:24.930> like<00:00:25.140> that<00:00:25.730> you<00:00:26.730> can

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
just pop that out here like that you can

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.320 
just pop that out here like that you can
extend<00:00:27.690> it<00:00:27.840> out<00:00:28.220> fully<00:00:29.220> like<00:00:29.670> this<00:00:29.880> and<00:00:30.150> then

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
extend it out fully like this and then

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.290 
extend it out fully like this and then
you<00:00:30.420> can<00:00:30.600> bend<00:00:31.320> it<00:00:31.470> to<00:00:31.830> suit<00:00:32.070> the<00:00:32.279> best<00:00:32.489> to<00:00:33.149> get

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
you can bend it to suit the best to get

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.360 
you can bend it to suit the best to get
the<00:00:33.420> best<00:00:33.539> signal<00:00:33.749> sure<00:00:34.079> to<00:00:34.170> say<00:00:34.379> so<00:00:35.010> here<00:00:35.249> you

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
the best signal sure to say so here you

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:36.680 
the best signal sure to say so here you
can<00:00:35.460> have<00:00:35.550> it<00:00:35.699> flat<00:00:35.969> you<00:00:36.149> can<00:00:36.300> have<00:00:36.480> it<00:00:36.570> like

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
can have it flat you can have it like

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.869 
can have it flat you can have it like
that<00:00:36.719> you<00:00:37.620> can<00:00:37.800> twist<00:00:38.039> it<00:00:38.190> like<00:00:38.370> that<00:00:38.550> and<00:00:38.730> get

that you can twist it like that and get

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.299 
that you can twist it like that and get
the<00:00:38.969> best<00:00:39.149> signal<00:00:39.510> on<00:00:39.659> the<00:00:40.499> front<00:00:41.039> we've<00:00:41.280> got

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
the best signal on the front we've got

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.009 
the best signal on the front we've got
three<00:00:41.640> activity<00:00:42.120> lights<00:00:42.329> which<00:00:42.510> you<00:00:42.629> may<00:00:42.780> just

be able to see there we've got the sort

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.559 
be able to see there we've got the sort
of<00:00:45.989> signal<00:00:46.679> it's<00:00:47.489> receiving<00:00:47.909> the<00:00:48.149> Wi-Fi

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:48.569 
of signal it's receiving the Wi-Fi

00:00:48.569 --> 00:00:50.689 
of signal it's receiving the Wi-Fi
because<00:00:49.079> I'll<00:00:49.739> tell<00:00:49.980> you<00:00:50.069> what<00:00:50.190> that<00:00:50.399> does<00:00:50.579> in

phone charge you can plug it into that
as<00:01:09.270> well<00:01:09.540> so<00:01:10.439> there's<00:01:10.619> the<00:01:10.829> ya<00:01:11.299> mini<00:01:12.299> USB

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
as well so there's the ya mini USB

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.170 
as well so there's the ya mini USB
connector<00:01:13.079> there<00:01:13.530> now<00:01:14.280> well<00:01:14.909> this<00:01:15.000> basically

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
connector there now well this basically

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.840 
connector there now well this basically
does<00:01:15.509> it<00:01:15.930> receives<00:01:16.409> TV<00:01:16.829> pictures<00:01:17.189> TV<00:01:17.490> signals

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
does it receives TV pictures TV signals

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.999 
does it receives TV pictures TV signals
from<00:01:18.060> your<00:01:18.539> local<00:01:18.780> transmitter<00:01:19.289> the<00:01:19.500> digital

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
from your local transmitter the digital

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.060 
from your local transmitter the digital
ones<00:01:20.329> so<00:01:21.329> you<00:01:21.360> get<00:01:21.630> free<00:01:22.140> view<00:01:22.409> effectively

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
ones so you get free view effectively

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.179 
ones so you get free view effectively
and<00:01:23.280> then<00:01:23.909> it<00:01:24.060> creates<00:01:24.719> its<00:01:25.170> own<00:01:25.320> hotspot<00:01:25.680> you

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
and then it creates its own hotspot you

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.730 
and then it creates its own hotspot you
connect<00:01:26.939> your<00:01:27.119> phone<00:01:27.360> to<00:01:27.420> the<00:01:27.810> Wi-Fi<00:01:28.229> hotspot

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
connect your phone to the Wi-Fi hotspot

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.700 
connect your phone to the Wi-Fi hotspot
that<00:01:29.130> this<00:01:29.340> creates<00:01:29.729> and<00:01:30.420> then<00:01:30.689> using<00:01:31.380> an<00:01:31.469> app

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
that this creates and then using an app

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.429 
that this creates and then using an app
which<00:01:32.310> is<00:01:32.340> available<00:01:32.850> for<00:01:33.200> Android<00:01:34.200> as<00:01:34.380> well

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:34.380 
this might be encrypted I'm not entirely

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:36.920 
this might be encrypted I'm not entirely
sure<00:04:34.560> but<00:04:34.770> let's<00:04:35.100> just<00:04:35.310> see<00:04:35.460> what<00:04:35.669> happens

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:40.680 
no there you go evil plus one volume

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:41.900 
no there you go evil plus one volume
control<00:04:41.009> obviously<00:04:41.280> is<00:04:41.550> down<00:04:41.699> the<00:04:41.819> bottom

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:41.910 
control obviously is down the bottom

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:47.390

here<00:04:44.840> very<00:04:45.840> good<00:04:46.080> picture<00:04:46.289> and<00:04:46.680> again<00:04:47.190> let's

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:47.400 
here very good picture and again let's

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:49.700 
here very good picture and again let's
