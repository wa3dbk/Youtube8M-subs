00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:54.800 
system is not better than the other guys

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:57.400 
system is not better than the other guys
and<00:02:55.800> I'm<00:02:55.920> speaking<00:02:56.310> more<00:02:56.490> from<00:02:56.670> experience

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
like about one system that I don't like

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:02.960 
like about one system that I don't like

about it or that you know that I would
prefer<00:03:03.090> on<00:03:03.390> another<00:03:03.660> system<00:03:04.280> one<00:03:05.280> thing<00:03:05.490> I<00:03:05.580> do

prefer on another system one thing I do

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.910 
prefer on another system one thing I do
got<00:03:05.850> to<00:03:05.910> say<00:03:06.120> is<00:03:06.270> you<00:03:06.300> know<00:03:06.510> with<00:03:06.660> the<00:03:06.690> ps3<00:03:07.320> the

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
got to say is you know with the ps3 the

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.460 
got to say is you know with the ps3 the
hardware<00:03:08.340> it's<00:03:09.300> been<00:03:09.510> proven<00:03:09.900> and<00:03:10.080> shown<00:03:10.110> that

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
hardware it's been proven and shown that

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:12.620 
hardware it's been proven and shown that
the<00:03:10.620> hardware<00:03:11.010> is<00:03:11.250> more<00:03:11.790> advanced<00:03:12.120> than<00:03:12.300> that

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:12.630 
the hardware is more advanced than that

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:14.870 
the hardware is more advanced than that
what's<00:03:13.020> given<00:03:13.650> on<00:03:13.770> the<00:03:13.860> 360<00:03:14.430> and<00:03:14.610> i'm<00:03:14.700> pretty

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
what's given on the 360 and i'm pretty

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:16.610 
what's given on the 360 and i'm pretty
sure<00:03:15.120> that<00:03:15.300> could<00:03:15.420> be<00:03:15.480> due<00:03:16.140> to<00:03:16.170> the<00:03:16.320> fact<00:03:16.470> that

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
sure that could be due to the fact that

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:20.330 
sure that could be due to the fact that
360<00:03:17.190> was<00:03:17.430> out<00:03:17.580> a<00:03:17.989> year<00:03:18.989> omo<00:03:19.709> i<00:03:19.739> think<00:03:20.040> a<00:03:20.130> year

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
360 was out a year omo i think a year

360 was out a year omo i think a year
year<00:03:20.550> and<00:03:20.610> a<00:03:20.700> half<00:03:20.880> before<00:03:21.380> ps3<00:03:22.380> even<00:03:22.650> came<00:03:22.860> out

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:24.230 
year and a half before ps3 even came out

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:26.870 
year and a half before ps3 even came out
one<00:03:25.230> do<00:03:25.440> one<00:03:25.860> thing<00:03:25.920> I<00:03:26.160> do<00:03:26.220> got<00:03:26.489> to<00:03:26.610> say<00:03:26.730> I<00:03:26.760> do

one do one thing I do got to say I do

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:30.470 
one do one thing I do got to say I do
not<00:03:27.180> like<00:03:27.360> about<00:03:27.510> the<00:03:28.040> 360<00:03:29.040> is<00:03:29.220> the<00:03:29.480> controller

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
not like about the 360 is the controller

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:33.320 
not like about the 360 is the controller
and<00:03:31.320> maybe<00:03:31.890> the<00:03:32.070> to<00:03:32.400> the<00:03:32.489> fact<00:03:32.730> that<00:03:32.820> I'm<00:03:33.000> used

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:33.330 
and maybe the to the fact that I'm used

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:38.120 
and maybe the to the fact that I'm used
to<00:03:33.450> the<00:03:34.260> ps3<00:03:35.000> but<00:03:36.000> honestly<00:03:36.959> the<00:03:37.200> ps3<00:03:37.709> has<00:03:37.860> very

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
to the ps3 but honestly the ps3 has very

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:40.130 
to the ps3 but honestly the ps3 has very
smooth<00:03:38.489> controller<00:03:38.940> it's<00:03:39.600> very<00:03:39.900> lightweight

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.140 
smooth controller it's very lightweight

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:43.220 
smooth controller it's very lightweight
and<00:03:40.560> it<00:03:41.190> feels<00:03:41.400> real<00:03:41.790> good<00:03:41.820> in<00:03:42.060> the<00:03:42.120> hands<00:03:42.510> even

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
and it feels real good in the hands even

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:45.770 
and it feels real good in the hands even
after<00:03:43.350> sweating<00:03:44.239> that's<00:03:45.239> one<00:03:45.420> thing<00:03:45.450> I<00:03:45.630> did

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
after sweating that's one thing I did

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:48.289 
after sweating that's one thing I did
notice<00:03:45.810> on<00:03:46.230> the<00:03:46.380> 360<00:03:46.860> so<00:03:47.070> far<00:03:47.280> is<00:03:47.430> that<00:03:47.459> after

00:03:48.289 --> 00:03:48.299 
notice on the 360 so far is that after

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:49.729 
notice on the 360 so far is that after
playing<00:03:48.750> for<00:03:48.870> a<00:03:49.049> while<00:03:49.080> my<00:03:49.350> hands<00:03:49.560> start<00:03:49.709> to

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:49.739 
playing for a while my hands start to

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:51.320 
playing for a while my hands start to
get<00:03:49.890> sweaty<00:03:50.160> my<00:03:50.370> controller<00:03:50.760> gets<00:03:51.000> actually

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:51.330 
get sweaty my controller gets actually

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:54.410 
get sweaty my controller gets actually
very<00:03:51.510> slippery<00:03:52.430> also<00:03:53.430> the<00:03:53.549> control<00:03:53.880> is<00:03:54.030> really

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:54.420 
very slippery also the control is really

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:56.870 
very slippery also the control is really
heavy<00:03:54.630> and<00:03:54.930> it's<00:03:55.560> not<00:03:55.769> as<00:03:56.010> smooth<00:03:56.430> that's<00:03:56.730> the

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:56.880 
heavy and it's not as smooth that's the

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:58.430 
heavy and it's not as smooth that's the
thing<00:03:57.060> I<00:03:57.150> like<00:03:57.330> about<00:03:57.360> the<00:03:57.660> ps3<00:03:57.840> is<00:03:58.170> that<00:03:58.320> the

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 
thing I like about the ps3 is that the

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.350 
thing I like about the ps3 is that the
controller<00:03:58.860> is<00:03:58.980> much<00:03:59.459> more<00:03:59.730> smooth<00:04:00.030> than<00:04:00.060> the

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:00.360 
controller is much more smooth than the

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:02.870 
controller is much more smooth than the
than<00:04:01.350> the<00:04:01.380> 360<00:04:02.130> is<00:04:02.160> and<00:04:02.400> that's<00:04:02.549> just<00:04:02.730> my

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:02.880 
than the 360 is and that's just my

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:05.270 
than the 360 is and that's just my
opinion<00:04:02.910> and<00:04:03.780> that's<00:04:04.650> one<00:04:04.860> thing<00:04:04.890> I<00:04:05.100> like

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
opinion and that's one thing I like

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:08.539 
opinion and that's one thing I like
about<00:04:05.310> it<00:04:05.570> I<00:04:06.570> do<00:04:07.290> i<00:04:07.709> do<00:04:07.769> got<00:04:07.980> to<00:04:08.100> say<00:04:08.220> about<00:04:08.340> the

00:04:08.539 --> 00:04:08.549 
about it I do i do got to say about the

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:10.370 
about it I do i do got to say about the
360<00:04:09.090> though<00:04:09.209> the<00:04:09.390> online<00:04:09.660> experience<00:04:09.870> is<00:04:10.260> much

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:10.380 
360 though the online experience is much

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:13.820 
360 though the online experience is much
better<00:04:10.680> as<00:04:11.100> far<00:04:11.580> as<00:04:11.850> you<00:04:12.570> know<00:04:12.690> xbox<00:04:13.049> live<00:04:13.320> and

to ps3 also the the ps3's interface to
me<00:04:21.330> is<00:04:21.510> much<00:04:21.989> more<00:04:22.289> simpler<00:04:22.770> than<00:04:22.950> what<00:04:23.789> you

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:10.180 
can't just switch out very easily or
