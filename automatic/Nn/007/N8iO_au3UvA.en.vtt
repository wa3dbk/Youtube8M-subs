00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:05.250
 Well this is the first video about 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.720
 the basic knowledge of 3d max 2015 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:10.370
 where are we going to explore and are we going to 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.370
 understand the program interface 

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:15.820
 ok the 3d max program interface 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:18.130
 is divided as follows in the 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:21.009
 top we find the button 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:23.560
 application by clicking on the main click 

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:25.509
 we get a menu very similar to 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:28.340
 any of the other programs either 

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:31.760
 from microsoft windows 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:34.040
 word excell any type of program 

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:37.310
 very basic simply has the button 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:39.410
 application when it opens presents the 

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:41.090
 main tools tools 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:43.329
 of documents as they are open a new 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:46.200
 document 

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:48.090
 and open a recent document 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:52.950
 a document saved previously 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:55.170
 save the file the file the file 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:58.500
 current the file that is being worked on 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.510
 save the current file with a new 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.059
 name or with a new extension a 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:07.260
 new format whether match format 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:09.540
 2015 or three others 2014 2013 2012 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:12.870
 etc. can also be imported 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:15.510
 files from the network and from a bus from 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:17.520
 maya this is quite useful and the same 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:19.350
 that the same thing to export files is 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.170
 can export the models that are being 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:25.080
 working within the program and also 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.420
 you can reset the interface and leave it 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.979
 how was it from the beginning if it is that 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.619
 it was modified while it was 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.420
 working now all the major 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.630
 tools that we have that we have 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.870
 here we can find them in this one 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.510
 this quick access menu 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:44.170
 where we can find what to open a 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:46.640
 new scene open a previous file 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:51.110
 previously saved save the 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:53.660
 Current file and good options more 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:55.750
 common that are the control z the undoing 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:57.880
 and the redo 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:59.680
 then we are here in the part 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.720
 right we find the bar 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:03.400
 search or the search menu for what 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:05.320
 serves this tool is quite 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:07.560
 pretty useful when you're starting 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:12.300
 with the program and you have some doubts 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.300
 the problem the problem could be that 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:18.420
 does not possess do not have a help in language 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.480
 Spanish what is this tool for? 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:23.780
 any word or any any 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:27.480
 name of any tool that you place 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:29.730
 here inside the inside of this bar we 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:32.970
 will redirect towards the page 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:34.820
 of official help from authors and it's going to 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:37.770
 show a series of articles where 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:39.240
 where all the explanations will be explained 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:40.680
 functions that tool has by 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:44.000
 at least let's write let's do 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.000
 a test we are going to write box 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:49.840
 and it will take us directly as 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:52.420
 can see the help page health 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:55.390
 autodesk.com 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:57.980
 and shows us the results with the 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:00.500
 word box or box 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:03.620
 and we can see that they have 1520 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:04.730
 results with the word caja in English 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.799
 Of course 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:08.230
 here we also have two filters for the 

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:10.580
 search 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:15.580
 and we close 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:15.580
 now if we try that same with box 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:21.120
 as we can see it will not come out 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:23.370
 no result in any any 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:26.489
 result has been found by boxes 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:28.680
 from here since he owns is a help 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:30.000
 but only unfortunately in language 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:32.310
 English 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.470
 unlike other programs of others 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:37.380
 at least autocad if you have a help 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:40.140
 in Spanish and in others in other so many 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:42.370
 languages also good following here 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:44.260
 we have the menu bar 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:46.060
 this is also very similar to any 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.440
 other types of programs open here 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:51.940
 we have the main functions 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:54.250
 control z move rotate and that kind of 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:58.300
 the basic functions we also have 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:04:00.310
 tools groups and this type d 

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:02.430
 unless you are going to see more later 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:04.349
 as the videos go by 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:06.719
 and also then later we meet 

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:08.909
 with this extensive bar here which is the 

00:04:06.719 --> 00:04:11.180
 toolbar now as we can 

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:14.129
 see many of these 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:16.259
 many of these functions are 

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:18.660
 here also in this as we can see 

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:22.610
 we select the world 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:22.610
 and here is very rotate 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:29.169
 rotate 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:29.169
 scalar rotate scalar 

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:33.810
 they are like shortcuts for the 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:36.000
 tools that are here 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:37.650
 and in the videos later on in the 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.180
 third or fourth video we will start to see 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:43.409
 about the toolbar what 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:46.319
 it's a fairly extensive subject 

00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:47.639
 and then later we find the 

00:04:46.319 --> 00:04:49.199
 command panel where we can 

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:52.709
 find also the commands for 

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:55.559
 create objects and to modify objects and 

00:04:52.709 --> 00:04:58.080
 It is also has the same 

00:04:55.559 --> 00:04:59.580
 has this bar that is that all the 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:02.099
 tools that we have here we can 

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:05.189
 find here as we can see we're going 

00:05:02.099 --> 00:05:07.039
 to the menu create standard primitives and 

00:05:05.189 --> 00:05:09.419
 we find the different 

00:05:07.039 --> 00:05:12.239
 objects that we can create is the same 

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:15.360
 that the create standard menu is here 

00:05:12.239 --> 00:05:17.569
 primitives and the objects that can be 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:17.569
 create 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:23.460
 well then we continue with the bar 

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:25.470
 animation that is this that is for when 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:27.199
 We are already working on video for 

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:29.699
 when we have some animated object 

00:05:27.199 --> 00:05:31.919
 we can start moving the bar already 

00:05:29.699 --> 00:05:34.390
 work with that bar but that's going to 

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:37.120
 go see later 

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:39.040
 and here are these four screens that 

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:40.660
 we have here is called the river by the 

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:44.290
 workspace that is where we are going to 

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:45.880
 start doing all the whole scene that 

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:47.830
 let's start to develop 

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:50.140
 all the work we have here 

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:52.320
 we can find the buttons auto ok and 

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:54.030
 set cake that are for 

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:56.400
 for the animation part they are a 

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:58.300
 complement of the animation bar and 

00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:01.370
 here we can find 

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:02.930
 buttons 

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:05.040
 to start moving the bar 

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:06.420
 animation as you can see 

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:08.740
 every time I click, it starts to move 

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:11.090
 one frame forward 

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:13.880
 the play and you start 

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:16.310
 to play the pause and return it to 

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:19.300
 starting point and here we find several 

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:21.290
 functions to start working in the 

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:23.360
 workspace that's what 

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:24.560
 let's see in the next video in the 

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:28.280
 next video let's start to see 

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:31.070
 about the workspace and here by 

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:35.590
 last we have the macro remember that it is 

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:39.190
 something like as if we worked in 

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:43.320
 as I explain in a script format 

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:45.570
 each each action has a 

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:47.070
 a language your click to work it something 

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:49.470
 as well as in coach we also work 

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:52.020
 this type of forms but that also 

00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:54.570
 you will see later and well this has been 

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:57.180
 all for this first video in the second 

00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:59.130
 video talk about 

00:06:57.180 --> 00:07:00.630
 of the development of the interface and how 

00:06:59.130 --> 00:07:03.500
 start moving through it 

00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:03.500
 see you later
