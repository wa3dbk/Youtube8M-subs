00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:09.030
 hello everyone with you to the river and today 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:12.389
 me another cool mod for you so 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:16.020
 This mod is for cheaters so please do not 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:19.699
 criticize and since you see me 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:23.670
 out of my head is kind of a black stripe to 

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:29.609
 coal so let me tell you what 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:32.099
 it is and so when you turn this 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:35.070
 mod choose using the letter y 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:37.530
 English ore you are interested in she 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.500
 shown in the upper left and so I 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.390
 choose coal and when i press the left 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.700
 or right mouse button 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.820
 coming from me 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:51.150
 such a line of some particles 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:56.120
 to the material that interests me that is 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:56.120
 if i want to find coal choosing coal and 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:03.150
 this mod shows me where it is 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:05.820
 coal and so coal I already mined it by the way 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:07.170
 I'm on the server now and I want to advance 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.080
 warn that on some servers 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.900
 there is protection from this chat on some 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.460
 no so but most servers are not 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:19.619
 has protection against this cheat 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:21.960
 and so let's see how they 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:24.119
 use push small letter and I 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.280
 I choose iron ore and here I am 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:28.979
 distance to iron ore is shown 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.240
 and the direction to her so here I already have 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:34.070
 there is iron ore 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:36.840
 so what else do I need for happiness yet 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:38.729
 you need of course diamonds so let's 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.100
 find in the shadow let's try to find 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:46.710
 gold ore has already shown the distance 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:49.150
 16 blocks so I have to dig 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:53.250
 a little there 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:53.250
 where does this mod show me 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:00.970
 so I'm close now 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:09.310
 I was very close so 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:14.130
 and just this mod brought me 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:14.130
 to gold to gold ore 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.090
 so try to test this mod further 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.450
 choose another ore is already diamond 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.400
 ore 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.770
 so the distance to the diamond ore is mine 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:30.599
 11 blocks let's 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:34.709
 So we get to go there already is here 

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:38.730
 all plowed by someone but diamond ore 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:41.040
 and here we came across privat 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:43.410
 the territory here is taken over as i am 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:46.290
 I play on the server so dig here 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:48.660
 so here I can not now so well let's 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:55.709
 try to move to another place and 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:59.250
 search for diamonds there when shown 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:03:01.620
 instead of the numbers three stripes it means 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:04.230
 what does it mean that at a distance of 3 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:08.700
 I am not interested in chunks 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:10.010
 ore and so diamond here nowhere not so 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:13.349
 let's look for another 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:16.200
 Emerald died here, too, there is no and 

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:19.130
 lapis lazuli lapis lazuli somewhere here 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.130
 let's go find him 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:28.560
 it's getting dark 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:31.470
 so lapis lazuli somewhere close 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:33.740
 I hope he will not shave in private 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:36.910
 this 

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:36.910
 you will not be able to show 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:43.640
 that really lapis lazuli is here and before 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:46.920
 I thought I could not get to him 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:50.000
 how he is under the poor 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:55.670
 so let's look for something else 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.670
 redstone here's a dream somewhere out there 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:00.930
 So 

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:06.680
 I'm close now 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:06.680
 the distance is reduced so 

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:13.760
 he is around here 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:13.760
 Here we found him 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:21.320
 So 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:22.699
 what materials are there glow stone 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:26.250
 quartz 

00:04:22.699 --> 00:04:27.350
 well clear coal iron ore is clear 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:33.300
 Gold Ore 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:35.790
 diamonds emerald lapis lazuli redstone so all 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:38.130
 the most necessary can be found with 

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:39.979
 using this mod and so try 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:45.150
 still find diamonds somewhere here 

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:48.199
 but something they are not here in the district apparently 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:48.199
 everything is already found 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:08.539
 there are no diamonds here and there is no me 

00:05:05.069 --> 00:05:11.370
