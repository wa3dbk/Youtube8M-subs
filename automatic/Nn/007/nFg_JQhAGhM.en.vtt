00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 
really like let know well I let's try

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.789 
really like let know well I let's try
that<00:03:32.940> bought<00:03:33.420> a<00:03:33.450> lot<00:03:33.870> of<00:03:33.959> protection<00:03:34.139> terms<00:03:34.620> on

00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:34.799 
that bought a lot of protection terms on

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:38.330 
that bought a lot of protection terms on
a<00:03:34.829> UT<00:03:35.160> weekend<00:03:35.549> but<00:03:36.239> well<00:03:36.829> this<00:03:37.829> pet<00:03:38.099> is

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
a UT weekend but well this pet is

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:42.099 
a UT weekend but well this pet is
probably<00:03:38.790> only<00:03:39.060> by<00:03:39.450> playing<00:03:39.930> going<00:03:40.290> to<00:03:40.500> low<00:03:40.650> 70

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:42.109 
probably only by playing going to low 70

00:03:42.109 --> 00:03:48.770 
probably only by playing going to low 70
so<00:03:43.109> to<00:03:43.919> the<00:03:44.010> next<00:03:44.250> round<00:03:47.120> so<00:03:48.120> we<00:03:48.150> aren't<00:03:48.450> nearly

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
so to the next round so we aren't nearly

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:50.990 
so to the next round so we aren't nearly
four<00:03:49.349> minutes<00:03:49.590> reading<00:03:49.919> that's<00:03:50.250> only<00:03:50.519> feeling

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
four minutes reading that's only feeling

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.690 
four minutes reading that's only feeling
the<00:03:51.120> pet<00:03:51.299> and<00:03:51.510> taking<00:03:51.870> items<00:03:52.019> from<00:03:52.380> the<00:03:52.799> stuff

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
the pet and taking items from the stuff

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.750 
the pet and taking items from the stuff
the<00:03:54.239> spectra<00:03:54.630> is<00:03:54.780> definitely<00:03:55.139> not<00:03:55.319> going<00:03:55.530> away

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:55.760 
the spectra is definitely not going away

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:01.640 
the spectra is definitely not going away
since<00:03:56.760> well<00:03:57.209> it's<00:03:57.959> not<00:03:58.109> a<00:03:58.169> bad<00:03:58.349> thing

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:09.569 

and<00:04:02.650> here<00:04:03.400> we<00:04:03.489> go<00:04:03.519> with<00:04:03.849> even<00:04:04.239> more<00:04:04.510> items<00:04:08.579> so

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:09.579 
and here we go with even more items so

00:04:09.579 --> 00:04:12.000 
and here we go with even more items so
let<00:04:10.389> me<00:04:10.480> take<00:04:10.629> a<00:04:10.659> look<00:04:10.959> if<00:04:11.139> there<00:04:11.499> is<00:04:11.680> something

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.010 
let me take a look if there is something

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:16.020 
let me take a look if there is something
I<00:04:12.370> forgot<00:04:12.549> no<00:04:13.060> there<00:04:13.299> is<00:04:13.450> not<00:04:13.870> probably<00:04:15.030> so

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:16.030 
I forgot no there is not probably so

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:30.430 
I forgot no there is not probably so
yeah

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:30.440 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:33.340 

so<00:04:31.250> ring<00:04:31.760> of<00:04:31.880> divine<00:04:32.300> faith<00:04:32.690> I'm<00:04:32.990> not<00:04:33.140> really

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:33.350 
so ring of divine faith I'm not really
