Earth Day it is really really cool it
took<00:00:24.740> a<00:00:24.830> few<00:00:24.949> steps<00:00:25.039> you<00:00:25.640> know<00:00:25.730> they're<00:00:25.849> not

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:25.970 
took a few steps you know they're not

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:28.599 
took a few steps you know they're not
epically<00:00:26.779> huge<00:00:27.199> steps<00:00:27.500> but<00:00:27.710> they<00:00:27.980> are<00:00:28.009> a<00:00:28.220> huge

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:28.609 
epically huge steps but they are a huge

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:30.490 
epically huge steps but they are a huge
starting<00:00:28.939> point<00:00:29.150> laptops<00:00:29.929> do<00:00:30.050> make<00:00:30.199> a<00:00:30.289> lot<00:00:30.439> of

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:30.500 
starting point laptops do make a lot of

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.019 
starting point laptops do make a lot of
waste<00:00:30.800> we<00:00:30.949> have<00:00:31.039> a<00:00:31.099> lot<00:00:31.220> of<00:00:31.250> e-waste<00:00:31.640> on<00:00:31.910> our

00:00:32.019 --> 00:00:32.029 
waste we have a lot of e-waste on our

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:34.080 
waste we have a lot of e-waste on our
planet<00:00:32.270> and<00:00:32.540> this<00:00:33.110> is<00:00:33.260> a<00:00:33.290> good<00:00:33.470> way<00:00:33.590> to<00:00:33.620> start

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:34.090 
planet and this is a good way to start

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:36.190 
planet and this is a good way to start
backing<00:00:35.090> off<00:00:35.210> on<00:00:35.360> that<00:00:35.480> now<00:00:35.660> it<00:00:35.780> does<00:00:35.960> three

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:36.200 
backing off on that now it does three

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.600 
backing off on that now it does three
things<00:00:36.230> first<00:00:36.649> of<00:00:36.770> all<00:00:36.829> that<00:00:36.950> are<00:00:37.040> green<00:00:37.219> and

the first thing is the most important
one<00:00:39.200> it's<00:00:39.350> made<00:00:39.440> out<00:00:39.590> of<00:00:39.620> 100%<00:00:40.039> recycled

00:00:40.529 --> 00:00:40.539

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:19.820 
does this make why would you put you

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:22.000 
does this make why would you put you
know<00:01:19.940> a<00:01:20.270> netbook<00:01:20.870> and<00:01:21.110> a<00:01:21.290> bag<00:01:21.500> inside<00:01:21.860> of<00:01:21.950> a

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:38.830 
the design inside now it's kind of silly
inside<00:01:37.940> you're<00:01:38.060> gonna<00:01:38.270> say<00:01:38.480> you<00:01:38.540> know<00:01:38.690> what's

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:38.840 
inside you're gonna say you know what's

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:40.390 
inside you're gonna say you know what's
up<00:01:38.930> the<00:01:39.020> design<00:01:39.290> but<00:01:39.530> it<00:01:39.710> is<00:01:39.860> really<00:01:40.190> cool

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:40.400 
up the design but it is really cool

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.460 
up the design but it is really cool
first<00:01:40.610> of<00:01:40.730> all<00:01:40.820> it's<00:01:41.180> got<00:01:41.330> the<00:01:41.420> main<00:01:41.600> area<00:01:42.440> here

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:42.470 
first of all it's got the main area here

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:45.100 
first of all it's got the main area here
for<00:01:42.950> your<00:01:43.760> laptop<00:01:44.150> and<00:01:44.570> then<00:01:44.840> when<00:01:44.990> you<00:01:45.080> open

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:45.110

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:46.820 
it up and you look on the other side you

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:48.310 
it up and you look on the other side you
really<00:01:46.940> can't<00:01:47.240> see<00:01:47.420> this<00:01:47.540> on<00:01:47.690> the<00:01:47.720> camera<00:01:47.780> but

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:48.320

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:01.460 
and located and it really doesn't get

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:02.710 
and located and it really doesn't get
much<00:02:01.610> thicker<00:02:01.910> than<00:02:02.000> this<00:02:02.210> even<00:02:02.540> with<00:02:02.630> the

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:02.720 
much thicker than this even with the

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.630 
much thicker than this even with the
netbook<00:02:03.020> inside<00:02:03.410> it<00:02:03.530> kind<00:02:03.680> of<00:02:03.710> stays<00:02:03.920> the<00:02:04.610> same

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 
netbook inside it kind of stays the same

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.730 
netbook inside it kind of stays the same
thickness<00:02:05.060> so<00:02:05.180> very<00:02:05.630> very<00:02:05.810> nice<00:02:06.290> as<00:02:06.500> far<00:02:06.650> as

and<00:02:19.940> then<00:02:20.030> of<00:02:20.180> course<00:02:20.210> everything<00:02:20.540> being

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
and then of course everything being

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.110 
and then of course everything being
recycled<00:02:21.230> it<00:02:21.800> makes<00:02:22.010> it<00:02:22.130> just<00:02:22.370> awesome<00:02:22.880> very

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
recycled it makes it just awesome very

slight<00:04:22.550> typing<00:04:23.330> angle<00:04:23.690> so<00:04:23.840> you're<00:04:24.020> not<00:04:24.140> typing

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:24.530 
slight typing angle so you're not typing

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:26.290 
slight typing angle so you're not typing
completely<00:04:25.010> flat<00:04:25.280> you<00:04:25.729> got<00:04:25.850> a<00:04:25.880> little<00:04:26.120> bit<00:04:26.180> of

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:26.300 
completely flat you got a little bit of

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:28.180 
completely flat you got a little bit of
an<00:04:26.390> angle<00:04:26.660> when<00:04:26.780> you<00:04:26.810> type<00:04:27.020> the<00:04:27.229> keyboard<00:04:27.410> is

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:28.190 
an angle when you type the keyboard is

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:29.320 
an angle when you type the keyboard is
also<00:04:28.669> really

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:29.330 
also really

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:31.749

nice<00:04:29.569> for<00:04:29.870> typing<00:04:30.199> it<00:04:30.740> the<00:04:31.069> key<00:04:31.250> spacing<00:04:31.669> is

00:04:31.749 --> 00:04:31.759 
nice for typing it the key spacing is

00:04:31.759 --> 00:04:33.309 
nice for typing it the key spacing is
actually<00:04:32.030> really<00:04:32.270> big<00:04:32.810> it's<00:04:33.080> something<00:04:33.259> you

00:04:33.309 --> 00:04:33.319 
actually really big it's something you

00:04:33.319 --> 00:04:35.110 
actually really big it's something you
don't<00:04:33.409> find<00:04:33.620> on<00:04:33.770> netbooks<00:04:34.039> it<00:04:34.340> is<00:04:34.610> the<00:04:34.729> chiclet

type<00:04:35.270> the<00:04:35.419> keys<00:04:35.629> are<00:04:35.840> definitely<00:04:36.439> smaller

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:36.860 
type the keys are definitely smaller

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:39.279

00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:39.289 
than normal but with that huge amount of

00:04:39.289 --> 00:04:41.529 
than normal but with that huge amount of
spacing<00:04:39.919> it's<00:04:40.460> actually<00:04:40.759> really<00:04:41.000> easy<00:04:41.150> to

00:04:41.529 --> 00:04:41.539 
spacing it's actually really easy to
