00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:32.160
 Hi there, this is the first lesson from the course. 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.800
 learning to play guitar in this lesson we 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.260
 get acquainted with the basic concepts 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:39.000
 find out what the neck is what is dk what 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.880
 is the body of the guitar 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.070
 and what it is made that behind what is necessary and 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:46.830
 so on so hopefully you already have 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.080
 guitar because we are with you as much as possible 

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:51.239
 quickly try to move from theory 

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:52.920
 direct practice first you 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.080
 must understand that acoustic guitar 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.930
 divided into two main types 

00:00:55.080 --> 00:01:01.050
 this is a classic guitar and pop 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:03.330
 for example, I have a pop guitar at the end 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.750
 lesson after we learn what how 

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:09.030
 called that why what 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.220
 vulture what are frets and so on we 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.360
 let us return to this issue I will tell 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.360
 about the main differences 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:18.180
 classics from pop guitars and so here 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.520
 this stick is called the fingerboard and all this 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:23.280
 here is a big hollow inside box of 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.840
 The tree is called the hull at the end of the fingerboard and 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.110
 there is a so-called pen 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.370
 here it is on the chopping chopping overeat 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.650
 inserted into the strings 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:33.930
 one end and the second end they 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:36.360
 inserted into the bridge or in the delivery 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.980
 call it what you want but the strings themselves 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.470
 don't lie on the guitar itself 

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:42.930
 they lie on powders powders are made 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.660
 either plastic or bone here 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.730
 lower threshold here upper threshold 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:50.100
 they are needed to be regulated 

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:52.890
 string height in most guitar 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:55.170
 6 and they differ in thickness in 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.820
 production material and more 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.260
 some features that we 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.840
 discuss a little later 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:04.800
 these ones are called mods 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:06.840
 powders or shrinking just frets they 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:08.640
 need to extract either 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.950
 high note or low 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:14.130
 the closer to the body of the guitar we hold 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:16.560
 The string will be higher 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:17.700
 and vice versa the farther away from the guitar body 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:31.110
 we will hold the string 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:34.170
 the sound will be lower the front side 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:35.330
 The guitar shell is called the upper deck and 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:38.040
 vice versa 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:38.970
 the back of the guitar is called 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.280
 lower deck 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.930
 This part is called a shell and 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.490
 so we approach the questions how do 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.930
 to distinguish 

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:48.210
 classic guitar and you're weird 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.160
 Basically, there are three main points. 

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:52.950
 firstly on their classic guitars 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:55.770
 most cases feather and ridge 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:58.560
 the mechanism is different in the eat out hole 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:00.630
 or the chops themselves are arranged differently now on 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:03.530
 You see a picture which shows the 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:03.530
 classical guitar 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:08.629
 Secondly 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:09.080
 cal guitar fingerboard is wider at the strange and he 

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:11.209
 already 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:12.170
 well and in the third on the classics there are strings 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:14.599
 from nylon 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:16.280
 This is a synthetic material and such 

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:19.430
 to press the strings a little easier 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:21.019
 so many teachers advise starting 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:23.840
 it is from classical guitar 

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:25.940
 because squeezing a little bit 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:27.739
 lighter though i don't see much of it 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:29.959
 big difference i started exactly with and 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:32.239
 weird guitars and big problems for me 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:34.450
 did not arise and so hopefully you identified 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:36.709
 your guitar type moving on 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:39.829
 the next step is tuning the guitar 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:42.290
 I strongly advise even insist beginners and 

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:44.510
 even in principle for lovers to purchase 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:46.129
 music store tuner tuner this 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:47.239
 such a thing that allows for sure 

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:49.849
 tune your guitar 

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:51.859
 so that it was fine tuned and since 

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:54.650
 I already said string on 6 let's 

00:03:51.859 --> 00:03:57.470
 learn to understand where a string and how 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:59.540
 which country is called and so is 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:02.299
 the lower string which is the thinnest 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:04.430
 called the first string and the most 

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:07.340
 thick string called the sixth country 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:08.299
 that is, the calculus comes from below this we 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:13.669
 first string 

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:16.729
 which is slightly thicker 2 further 3 4 5 6 

00:04:13.669 --> 00:04:19.340
 that is, the strings just go in order but 

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:21.470
 we begin to count from the bottom and so each 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:23.780
 the string should give a certain note 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:26.090
 let's remember the school course 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:32.930
 music and remember what notes we have 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:34.460
 up-re-mi-fa-sol-la-si seven notes on 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:36.500
 guitar in most cases 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:38.450
 English letters are used 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:42.169
 notation of these notes note to 

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:47.630
 denoted by the letter b note by the letter d 

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:48.110
 notes letter i not of a letter f note 

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:51.470
 salt 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:52.970
 letter g notes for letter hey and note si 

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:55.940
 letters beat or 

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:57.860
 sometimes note s is denoted by the letter h so 

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:59.870
 the first string we have to give 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:02.090
 note mi that is, we commemorate as 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:05.510
 letter designation is a letter and 

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:07.180
 we insert the tuner we turn on it we pull 

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:09.669
 first string 

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:11.949
 twist the stick pull the country before 

00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:13.690
 moment as a tuner and does not appear 

00:05:11.949 --> 00:05:17.199
 notes that is in letter designation 

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:18.699
 the letter and the second string should be 

00:05:17.199 --> 00:05:21.070
 tuned to si note 

00:05:18.699 --> 00:05:22.210
 that is, in letter designation this 

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:25.270
 letter b 

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:28.930
 third string note salt g 

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:32.110
 fourth string but so on fifth or 

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:34.900
 the sixth string is tuned in the same way as 

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:36.699
 the first is also on note mi hope you have everything 

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:39.250
 it turned out he tuned his guitar 

00:05:36.699 --> 00:05:40.930
 if you have any questions write to 

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:42.610
 comments I will answer 

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:44.530
 and now I will talk about what will be 

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:46.780
 following lessons in the second lesson we 

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:49.270
 talk about the basics of picking 

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:52.240
 about putting your hands on how to properly 

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:53.919
 take the guitar where to put the right hand 

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:56.169
 where to put the left how to 

00:05:53.919 --> 00:05:57.789
 squeeze the country and so on also study 

00:05:56.169 --> 00:05:59.919
 basic rhythmic patterns and 

00:05:57.789 --> 00:06:01.990
 the simplest busting in the third lesson we 

00:05:59.919 --> 00:06:02.620
 let's start learning chords and all chord 

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:05.259
 the system 

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:08.020
 I'll talk about chords in general a little 

00:06:05.259 --> 00:06:10.000
 touch on the subject of how chords are built 

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:11.830
 we will study all this with examples and 

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:15.039
 in practice the fourth lesson will be 

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:17.139
 about chords on bars peculiar 

00:06:15.039 --> 00:06:19.750
 continuation of the third lesson but we will 

00:06:17.139 --> 00:06:22.240
 learning not just chords on the bar but I 

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:24.610
 teach you to put bars because u 

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:26.320
 most beginners have a problem 

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:28.330
 is that they can't put bars 

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:30.280
 some kind of 

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:32.680
 the strings don't sound like that 

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:34.750
 put correctly we will smoothly to 

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:36.880
 this approach and without any problems 

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:39.250
 put with you a bar and the fifth lesson will be 

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:42.370
 there is an idea of tare equipment about how to play 

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:44.320
 mediator where to start variable 

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:46.990
 bar and what other techniques are there 

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:49.780
 with a pick 6 a horn will be about decorating 

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:51.510
 tricks this hammer and slides breaks 

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:54.900
 flagpoles 

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:57.720
 and so on 7 horn will be learning 

00:06:54.900 --> 00:07:00.240
 songs that will combine all that 

00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:02.670
 it was before that we already learned it for 

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:05.150
 securing the material 8 hands will be a 

00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:05.150
 gamma 

00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:13.080
 the simplest range of natural major and 

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:14.640
 minor and pentatonic 9 will be the development 

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:18.210
 finger fluency here basically 

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:20.160
 exercises for speed and stretching 50 

00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:22.520
 and the final lesson will be the basis 

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:25.110
 improvisation we will learn with you 

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:27.890
 improvise everyone thanks for watching 

00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:27.890
 good luck bye
