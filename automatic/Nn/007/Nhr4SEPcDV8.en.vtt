00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
days after it had been in the past so

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.389 
days after it had been in the past so
the<00:00:44.600> only<00:00:45.600> thing<00:00:46.050> that<00:00:46.230> was<00:00:46.379> different<00:00:46.410> last

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
the only thing that was different last

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.729 
the only thing that was different last
cycle<00:00:47.760> is<00:00:48.239> I<00:00:48.899> was<00:00:49.559> drinking<00:00:50.100> spearmint<00:00:50.820> tea<00:00:51.149> I

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:51.739 
cycle is I was drinking spearmint tea I

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:54.670 
cycle is I was drinking spearmint tea I
had<00:00:52.739> been<00:00:52.890> told<00:00:53.100> that<00:00:53.430> it<00:00:53.579> helps<00:00:53.940> to<00:00:54.120> lower

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:54.680 
had been told that it helps to lower

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.490 
had been told that it helps to lower
testosterone<00:00:55.680> levels<00:00:56.430> and<00:00:56.809> it<00:00:57.809> helps<00:00:58.170> improve

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
testosterone levels and it helps improve

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.619 
testosterone levels and it helps improve
fertility<00:00:58.859> for<00:00:59.640> women<00:01:00.149> with<00:01:00.329> PCOS<00:01:01.020> and<00:01:02.629> I'm

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
fertility for women with PCOS and I'm

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.380 
fertility for women with PCOS and I'm
starting<00:01:04.080> to<00:01:04.320> believe<00:01:04.530> that<00:01:04.739> that<00:01:05.460> may<00:01:06.119> have

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
starting to believe that that may have

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.100 
starting to believe that that may have
been<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:07.439> reason<00:01:07.710> that<00:01:08.520> things<00:01:09.390> moved<00:01:09.869> along

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
been the reason that things moved along

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.250 
been the reason that things moved along
so<00:01:10.409> quickly<00:01:10.439> last<00:01:11.070> time<00:01:11.400> and<00:01:12.020> maybe<00:01:13.020> it's<00:01:13.229> a

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
so quickly last time and maybe it's a

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.260 
so quickly last time and maybe it's a
coincidence<00:01:13.380> maybe<00:01:14.340> you<00:01:14.549> know<00:01:14.729> differently

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
coincidence maybe you know differently

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.090 
coincidence maybe you know differently
but<00:01:17.240> today<00:01:18.240> I<00:01:18.600> was<00:01:19.110> really<00:01:19.439> bummed<00:01:19.619> out<00:01:19.830> about

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
but today I was really bummed out about

and I'm on muffled OPA which is

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:09.619 
and I'm on muffled OPA which is
apparently<00:03:07.920> a<00:03:07.980> really<00:03:08.400> old<00:03:08.640> medication<00:03:09.450> from

00:03:09.619 --> 00:03:09.629 
apparently a really old medication from

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:11.270 
apparently a really old medication from
the<00:03:09.690> 50s<00:03:10.200> because<00:03:10.500> it's<00:03:10.739> one<00:03:10.890> of<00:03:10.980> the<00:03:11.040> only

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
the 50s because it's one of the only

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.660 
the 50s because it's one of the only
safe<00:03:11.519> wants<00:03:11.849> to<00:03:11.940> take<00:03:12.260> if<00:03:13.260> I<00:03:13.590> were<00:03:14.159> to<00:03:14.340> conceive

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:18.229 
safe wants to take if I were to conceive
so<00:03:15.290> I'm<00:03:16.290> about<00:03:17.040> to<00:03:17.190> go<00:03:17.280> pick<00:03:17.430> that<00:03:17.489> up<00:03:17.669> I<00:03:17.970> guess

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 
so I'm about to go pick that up I guess

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:19.460 
so I'm about to go pick that up I guess
I'm<00:03:18.359> gonna<00:03:18.450> go<00:03:18.599> get<00:03:18.690> some<00:03:18.870> more<00:03:18.989> spearmint<00:03:19.380> tea

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
I'm gonna go get some more spearmint tea

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:20.960 
I'm gonna go get some more spearmint tea
and<00:03:19.650> kind<00:03:19.889> of<00:03:19.950> run<00:03:20.069> a<00:03:20.099> personal<00:03:20.489> experiment

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
and kind of run a personal experiment

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:24.640 
and kind of run a personal experiment
and<00:03:21.120> see<00:03:21.329> if<00:03:21.569> drinking<00:03:21.900> it<00:03:22.230> does<00:03:22.769> anything<00:03:23.280> to

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.650 
and see if drinking it does anything to

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:27.020 
and see if drinking it does anything to
get<00:03:25.650> my<00:03:25.829> follicles<00:03:26.340> where<00:03:26.639> they<00:03:26.730> need<00:03:26.880> to<00:03:26.910> be

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
get my follicles where they need to be

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:31.970 
get my follicles where they need to be
last<00:03:27.959> time<00:03:28.319> I<00:03:28.799> had<00:03:29.250> small<00:03:29.579> ones<00:03:29.819> like<00:03:29.940> this<00:03:30.980> was

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
last time I had small ones like this was

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:36.680 
last time I had small ones like this was
my<00:03:32.160> January<00:03:33.109> insemination<00:03:34.109> and<00:03:35.359> the<00:03:36.359> biggest

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
my January insemination and the biggest

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:38.720 
my January insemination and the biggest
one<00:03:36.810> was<00:03:36.840> only<00:03:37.049> 18<00:03:37.650> millimeters<00:03:38.220> which<00:03:38.549> I

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 
one was only 18 millimeters which I

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:41.539 
one was only 18 millimeters which I
guess<00:03:39.540> is<00:03:39.780> the<00:03:40.079> minimum<00:03:40.560> size<00:03:40.859> that<00:03:41.220> they<00:03:41.310> want

00:03:41.539 --> 00:03:41.549 
guess is the minimum size that they want

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:45.680 
guess is the minimum size that they want
it<00:03:41.669> to<00:03:41.699> be<00:03:42.410> so<00:03:43.410> I'm<00:03:43.949> just<00:03:44.459> gonna<00:03:44.609> try<00:03:45.359> it<00:03:45.419> and

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:45.690 
it to be so I'm just gonna try it and

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:47.089 
it to be so I'm just gonna try it and
see<00:03:45.900> if<00:03:45.959> it<00:03:46.049> works<00:03:46.260> if<00:03:46.440> you<00:03:46.500> had<00:03:46.739> any<00:03:46.949> success

00:03:47.089 --> 00:03:47.099 
see if it works if you had any success

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:48.710 
see if it works if you had any success
with<00:03:47.489> this<00:03:47.579> if<00:03:47.790> you<00:03:47.879> heard<00:03:48.030> anything<00:03:48.299> about<00:03:48.540> it

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
with this if you heard anything about it

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:49.970 
with this if you heard anything about it
let<00:03:48.900> me<00:03:48.930> know<00:03:49.049> I<00:03:49.199> don't<00:03:49.470> know<00:03:49.530> if<00:03:49.650> it's<00:03:49.769> an<00:03:49.859> old

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
let me know I don't know if it's an old

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:52.520 
let me know I don't know if it's an old
wives<00:03:50.190> tale<00:03:50.400> I<00:03:50.579> don't<00:03:50.940> know<00:03:51.030> if<00:03:51.419> it<00:03:52.049> was<00:03:52.349> just<00:03:52.470> a

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
wives tale I don't know if it was just a

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:54.979 
wives tale I don't know if it was just a
coincidence<00:03:53.129> I<00:03:53.459> guess<00:03:53.879> I'm<00:03:54.150> just<00:03:54.329> amazed<00:03:54.660> that

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:54.989 
coincidence I guess I'm just amazed that

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:57.520 
coincidence I guess I'm just amazed that
and<00:03:55.500> maybe<00:03:55.859> I<00:03:55.949> don't<00:03:56.069> know<00:03:56.370> enough<00:03:56.669> about<00:03:56.819> it<00:03:57.209> I

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:57.530 
and maybe I don't know enough about it I

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:59.930 
and maybe I don't know enough about it I
don't<00:03:58.530> know<00:03:58.739> how<00:03:58.980> there<00:03:59.220> could<00:03:59.489> be<00:03:59.549> such<00:03:59.910> a

00:03:59.930 --> 00:03:59.940 
don't know how there could be such a

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:04.449 
don't know how there could be such a
huge<00:04:00.269> difference<00:04:00.750> unless<00:04:01.650> it<00:04:02.250> was<00:04:02.459> that<00:04:02.730> so

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:04.459 
huge difference unless it was that so

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:07.699 
huge difference unless it was that so
but<00:04:05.459> maybe<00:04:05.639> women<00:04:05.940> just<00:04:06.180> don't<00:04:06.359> produce<00:04:06.780> those

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:07.709 
but maybe women just don't produce those

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:11.390 
but maybe women just don't produce those
kind<00:04:07.769> of<00:04:08.099> follicles<00:04:08.639> even<00:04:08.879> with<00:04:10.220> clomid<00:04:11.250> I

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
kind of follicles even with clomid I

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.520 
kind of follicles even with clomid I
don't<00:04:11.639> know<00:04:11.790> or<00:04:12.150> maybe<00:04:12.359> just<00:04:12.750> me<00:04:12.930> because<00:04:13.349> I'm

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.530 
don't know or maybe just me because I'm

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:16.009 
don't know or maybe just me because I'm
sure<00:04:13.739> everybody's<00:04:14.160> different<00:04:14.340> so<00:04:14.730> I<00:04:15.180> and<00:04:15.660> I'm

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:16.019 
sure everybody's different so I and I'm

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:17.569 
sure everybody's different so I and I'm
in<00:04:16.109> my<00:04:16.260> car<00:04:16.440> right<00:04:16.709> now<00:04:16.859> but<00:04:17.130> I<00:04:17.160> just<00:04:17.430> took<00:04:17.519> my

00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:17.579

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:18.770 
in my car right now but I just took my
seatbelt<00:04:18.000> off<00:04:18.120> you<00:04:18.299> should<00:04:18.449> always<00:04:18.539> wear
