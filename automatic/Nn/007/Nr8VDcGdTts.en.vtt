might have seen the video we did for the

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.230 
might have seen the video we did for the
tongue<00:01:55.829> hawk<00:01:56.070> and<00:01:56.280> how<00:01:56.460> I<00:01:56.490> think<00:01:56.850> the<00:01:56.909> shapes

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
tongue hawk and how I think the shapes

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.499 
tongue hawk and how I think the shapes
of<00:01:57.420> these<00:01:57.600> bats<00:01:57.930> are<00:01:58.079> actually<00:01:58.619> very<00:01:58.950> similar

00:01:59.499 --> 00:01:59.509 
of these bats are actually very similar

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:02.560 
of these bats are actually very similar
and<00:02:00.509> I<00:02:01.079> still<00:02:01.710> think<00:02:02.009> that<00:02:02.070> they<00:02:02.280> are

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:02.570 
and I still think that they are

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:07.990 
and I still think that they are
and<00:02:03.909> look<00:02:04.909> at<00:02:05.060> that<00:02:05.140> the<00:02:06.220> is<00:02:07.220> pretty<00:02:07.760> much<00:02:07.940> the

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 
and look at that the is pretty much the

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.900 
and look at that the is pretty much the
same<00:02:08.390> on<00:02:08.660> the<00:02:08.780> spine<00:02:09.080> really<00:02:09.670> pretty<00:02:10.670> much<00:02:10.789> the

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
same on the spine really pretty much the

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:12.699 
same on the spine really pretty much the
same<00:02:11.150> the<00:02:11.570> sweet<00:02:11.900> spots<00:02:12.260> in<00:02:12.410> the<00:02:12.500> same

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:12.709 
same the sweet spots in the same

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:15.730 
same the sweet spots in the same
position<00:02:13.450> the<00:02:14.450> edge<00:02:14.600> size<00:02:14.990> is<00:02:15.230> about<00:02:15.320> the<00:02:15.500> same

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:15.740 
position the edge size is about the same

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:17.949 
position the edge size is about the same
is<00:02:15.980> about<00:02:16.130> 34<00:02:16.760> millimeters<00:02:17.030> on<00:02:17.540> each<00:02:17.660> bat

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:17.959 
is about 34 millimeters on each bat

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:21.100 
is about 34 millimeters on each bat
incidentally<00:02:19.030> and<00:02:20.030> then<00:02:20.240> if<00:02:20.330> we<00:02:20.510> pull<00:02:20.780> them<00:02:20.930> up

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
incidentally and then if we pull them up

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.550 
incidentally and then if we pull them up
here<00:02:21.730> you<00:02:22.730> do<00:02:22.970> see<00:02:23.330> the<00:02:23.570> sweet<00:02:23.840> spot<00:02:24.110> is<00:02:24.500> the

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
here you do see the sweet spot is the

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.510 
here you do see the sweet spot is the
same<00:02:25.010> pretty<00:02:25.670> much<00:02:25.880> and<00:02:26.650> the<00:02:27.650> only<00:02:27.860> slight

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:28.520 
same pretty much and the only slight

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:30.400 
same pretty much and the only slight
difference<00:02:29.120> i<00:02:29.330> can<00:02:29.570> get<00:02:29.870> there<00:02:30.080> if<00:02:30.170> you<00:02:30.260> get<00:02:30.380> a

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410 
difference i can get there if you get a

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:33.490 
difference i can get there if you get a
good<00:02:30.740> shot<00:02:30.770> of<00:02:31.070> that<00:02:31.190> I<00:02:31.630> think<00:02:32.630> the<00:02:32.750> thraxton's

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
good shot of that I think the thraxton's

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.130 
good shot of that I think the thraxton's
got<00:02:33.860> up<00:02:34.010> slightly<00:02:34.610> more<00:02:35.090> her<00:02:35.239> bow<00:02:35.510> on<00:02:35.870> the

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
got up slightly more her bow on the

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.920 
got up slightly more her bow on the
blade<00:02:36.489> as<00:02:37.489> it<00:02:37.760> curves<00:02:38.090> in<00:02:38.390> a<00:02:38.420> little<00:02:38.660> bit<00:02:38.780> more

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
blade as it curves in a little bit more

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:41.770 
blade as it curves in a little bit more
as<00:02:39.080> you<00:02:39.170> can<00:02:39.320> see<00:02:39.560> at<00:02:39.680> the<00:02:39.770> tone<00:02:40.540> just<00:02:41.540> very

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
as you can see at the tone just very

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.170 
as you can see at the tone just very
slightly<00:02:42.260> but<00:02:43.190> that's<00:02:43.370> really<00:02:43.670> the<00:02:44.120> only

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.180 
slightly but that's really the only

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:46.660 
slightly but that's really the only
difference<00:02:44.840> i<00:02:45.200> can<00:02:45.800> see<00:02:46.070> between<00:02:46.400> these

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
difference i can see between these

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:49.090 
difference i can see between these
teapots<00:02:46.970> to<00:02:47.510> be<00:02:47.600> honest<00:02:47.840> because<00:02:48.350> pot<00:02:48.920> and

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:49.100 
teapots to be honest because pot and

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:51.580 
teapots to be honest because pot and
details<00:02:49.550> of<00:02:49.700> course<00:02:49.970> but<00:02:50.180> yeah<00:02:50.959> this<00:02:51.260> is<00:02:51.500> a

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
details of course but yeah this is a

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:55.120 
details of course but yeah this is a
very<00:02:51.739> very<00:02:52.040> similar<00:02:53.200> because<00:02:54.200> the<00:02:54.410> doctor<00:02:54.950> has

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.130 
very very similar because the doctor has

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:58.300 
very very similar because the doctor has
a<00:02:55.160> slight<00:02:55.430> longbow<00:02:55.940> should<00:02:56.720> pick<00:02:56.959> up<00:02:57.140> a<00:02:57.350> very

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310 
a slight longbow should pick up a very

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:01.449 
a slight longbow should pick up a very
slight<00:02:59.030> bit<00:02:59.330> better<00:02:59.630> but<00:03:00.160> you<00:03:01.160> know<00:03:01.220> I'm<00:03:01.310> it's

00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:01.459 
slight bit better but you know I'm it's

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:07.300 
slight bit better but you know I'm it's
this<00:03:01.670> back<00:03:01.850> to<00:03:02.150> pound<00:03:02.450> 10<00:03:05.890> it's<00:03:06.890> pretty<00:03:07.130> nice

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310 
this back to pound 10 it's pretty nice

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:09.070 
this back to pound 10 it's pretty nice
not<00:03:07.580> the<00:03:07.700> lightest<00:03:08.209> very<00:03:08.540> stretchy<00:03:08.840> it

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:09.080 
not the lightest very stretchy it

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:10.750 
not the lightest very stretchy it
certainly<00:03:09.470> doesn't<00:03:09.709> feel<00:03:09.950> too<00:03:10.160> content<00:03:10.549> if<00:03:10.670> it

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760 
certainly doesn't feel too content if it

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.699 
certainly doesn't feel too content if it
was<00:03:10.850> my<00:03:10.940> teeth<00:03:11.180> I'd<00:03:11.390> line<00:03:11.630> to<00:03:11.900> make<00:03:12.049> good<00:03:12.380> good

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:12.709 
was my teeth I'd line to make good good

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:17.320 
was my teeth I'd line to make good good
pickup<00:03:13.130> good<00:03:13.670> pickup<00:03:14.380> so<00:03:15.380> yeah<00:03:16.030> what<00:03:17.030> I<00:03:17.060> said

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:17.330 
pickup good pickup so yeah what I said

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:19.210 
pickup good pickup so yeah what I said
about<00:03:17.420> the<00:03:17.600> comparison<00:03:18.200> of<00:03:18.260> the<00:03:18.350> tomahawk<00:03:18.890> I

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.220 
about the comparison of the tomahawk I

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:22.120 
about the comparison of the tomahawk I
think<00:03:19.850> is<00:03:20.390> more<00:03:20.750> of<00:03:20.840> an<00:03:20.930> issue<00:03:21.049> if<00:03:21.620> you<00:03:21.860> entered

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:22.130 
think is more of an issue if you entered

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:23.800 
think is more of an issue if you entered
in<00:03:22.250> the<00:03:22.340> tomahawk<00:03:22.820> and<00:03:23.030> the<00:03:23.269> reason<00:03:23.540> is<00:03:23.660> is

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.810 
in the tomahawk and the reason is is

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:25.630 
in the tomahawk and the reason is is
that<00:03:23.989> as<00:03:24.110> a<00:03:24.140> new<00:03:24.440> bat<00:03:24.709> so<00:03:25.070> just<00:03:25.340> come<00:03:25.489> out<00:03:25.610> of

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:25.640 
that as a new bat so just come out of

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:28.150 
that as a new bat so just come out of
2013<00:03:26.390> was<00:03:26.930> the<00:03:27.049> thruxton<00:03:27.320> has<00:03:27.650> been<00:03:27.799> around

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:28.160 
2013 was the thruxton has been around

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.789 
2013 was the thruxton has been around
for<00:03:28.430> a<00:03:28.489> while<00:03:28.549> now<00:03:29.030> and<00:03:29.329> so<00:03:30.230> I<00:03:30.260> can't<00:03:30.650> really

00:03:30.789 --> 00:03:30.799 
for a while now and so I can't really

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:33.370 
for a while now and so I can't really
criticize<00:03:31.250> the<00:03:31.430> thruxton<00:03:31.900> for<00:03:32.900> the<00:03:32.959> tomahawk

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:33.380 
criticize the thruxton for the tomahawk

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:36.069 
criticize the thruxton for the tomahawk
looking<00:03:33.920> pretty<00:03:34.220> much<00:03:34.310> the<00:03:34.459> same<00:03:34.670> but<00:03:34.940> I<00:03:35.720> would

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:36.079 
looking pretty much the same but I would

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:38.710 
looking pretty much the same but I would
suggest<00:03:36.350> that<00:03:36.799> if<00:03:36.980> you<00:03:37.430> prefer<00:03:37.850> the<00:03:38.030> decals<00:03:38.540> on

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:38.720 
suggest that if you prefer the decals on

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:41.949 
suggest that if you prefer the decals on
the<00:03:38.810> tomahawk<00:03:40.239> get<00:03:41.239> rid<00:03:41.420> that<00:03:41.540> instead

00:03:41.949 --> 00:03:41.959 
the tomahawk get rid that instead

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:45.009 
the tomahawk get rid that instead
because<00:03:42.380> it's<00:03:42.410> pretty<00:03:42.980> much<00:03:43.070> the<00:03:43.160> same<00:03:43.370> bad<00:03:44.019> so

00:03:45.009 --> 00:03:45.019 
because it's pretty much the same bad so

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:47.949 
because it's pretty much the same bad so
yeah<00:03:45.260> they<00:03:46.010> have<00:03:46.310> a<00:03:46.340> bit<00:03:47.150> frustrating<00:03:47.810> that

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:47.959 
yeah they have a bit frustrating that

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:49.569 
yeah they have a bit frustrating that
it's<00:03:48.110> come<00:03:48.320> to<00:03:48.470> that<00:03:48.500> very<00:03:48.920> good<00:03:49.130> does<00:03:49.340> happen

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:49.579 
it's come to that very good does happen

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:51.940 
it's come to that very good does happen
other<00:03:50.209> manufacturers<00:03:50.660> good<00:03:51.049> so<00:03:51.320> I'll<00:03:51.590> let<00:03:51.739> me

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:51.950 
other manufacturers good so I'll let me

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:54.310 
other manufacturers good so I'll let me
be<00:03:52.130> off<00:03:52.250> in<00:03:52.760> terms<00:03:53.180> of<00:03:53.269> the<00:03:53.360> cosmetics<00:03:53.959> this<00:03:54.170> is

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:54.320 
be off in terms of the cosmetics this is

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:57.819 
be off in terms of the cosmetics this is
the<00:03:54.410> player<00:03:54.769> grade<00:03:55.959> so<00:03:56.959> it's<00:03:57.380> actually<00:03:57.709> the

00:03:57.819 --> 00:03:57.829 
the player grade so it's actually the

00:03:57.829 --> 00:04:00.160 
the player grade so it's actually the
second<00:03:58.280> from<00:03:58.579> the<00:03:58.640> top<00:03:58.910> at<00:03:59.510> the<00:03:59.570> middle<00:03:59.930> one<00:04:00.049> if

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:00.170 
second from the top at the middle one if

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:02.199
