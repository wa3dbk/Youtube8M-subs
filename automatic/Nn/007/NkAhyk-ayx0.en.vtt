00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:09.830
 welcome together here 

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:12.020
 me in the channel 83 meters and new video 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:15.290
 I can sit here with me in z4 

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:17.119
 35i and get the message oil level 

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:20.169
 or minimum falls below 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:21.950
 underlined sorry 

00:00:20.169 --> 00:00:24.020
 accordingly a liter of engine oil 

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:25.489
 refill and if you ok with that 

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:28.369
 confirm that the message is so far 

00:00:25.489 --> 00:00:30.259
 away, however, we have in the check 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:33.320
 Control for a message inside 

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:37.240
 Vehicle info will be that too 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:40.430
 displayed here in the vehicle status and 

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:41.840
 champagne-kontor engine oil level Refill as 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:42.320
 you can go back to the 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.570
 report 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.790
 so that's pretty smart 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:49.340
 system here about this video 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:53.360
 or simply this event here 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:53.840
 he has to look up to see if he has to 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.880
 on 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:59.440
 and how it works I want you 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:00.770
 in this video we show 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.930
 arrived 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:05.360
 no dipstick is located normally 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:07.820
 Here in the area somewhere new engine 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.990
 logically and if he has one 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.609
 Of course you can not do that 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:12.740
 Measure how I did it now 

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:16.490
 notification is then regularly 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:18.079
 even measure for the case died 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:19.569
 pull out and then just read 

00:01:18.079 --> 00:01:22.369
 actually work relatively easy 

00:01:19.569 --> 00:01:28.069
 yes here at bmw I can absolute 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:29.899
 mobil 10 w 40 mobil 1 july recommend and 

00:01:28.069 --> 00:01:32.659
 Now we want that in the engine 

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:34.579
 just the lid and here it is 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:36.200
 a level on the side we indicated 

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:38.509
 I'm fine here, I'll say it 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:41.299
 three and a half liters in it and 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:45.139
 accordingly be with afterwards 

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:47.600
 men are just a rest of one 

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:54.170
 liters have two and a half meters in here 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:55.100
 I have introduced a liter 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:56.929
 not here now 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.639
 to open the lid of these five 

00:01:56.929 --> 00:02:00.499
 liter canister leaves me too now 

00:01:58.639 --> 00:02:02.810
 undressed and then the whole 

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:04.969
 screw is in fact quite decent is 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.850
 a huge valve has whole, however 

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:12.490
 relative 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:15.600
 well empathize as you see you have 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:15.600
 very easy and slow 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.120
 Of course I do not know exactly when 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:31.020
 reached a liter that gave now again 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:33.600
 after there was almost nothing to match 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:34.830
 we can now give in again and 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:37.940
 Of course, not too much 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:37.940
 you have to take care of it 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:50.610
 gone a bit wrong 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:52.170
 So I put that again that was 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:54.060
 now about half a liter so needs 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:56.630
 is again the same thing again half 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.630
 liter in here 

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:08.210
 so refilled again checked 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:15.000
 a little bit I can still 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:21.950
 top up with the one liter reached 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:21.950
 but that should be enough 

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:30.870
 even a small circuit I investors 

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:36.939
 do that a few more steps 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:39.129
 But you realize enough right now 

00:03:36.939 --> 00:03:41.260
 from now we have here as well 

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:43.480
 there is still about two and a half 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:45.400
 liter of just three and a half liters 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:48.760
 yes that's how easy it is 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:50.680
 refilling engine of the engine oil is 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.010
 absolutely essential there must be lubricated 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:53.109
 become 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:55.180
 It is important that should be done regularly 

00:03:53.109 --> 00:03:56.409
 and i hope i could join you 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:58.690
 this video is still a little introduction 

00:03:56.409 --> 00:04:01.180
 if yes and it has you 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:04.650
 like the happy then up there and
