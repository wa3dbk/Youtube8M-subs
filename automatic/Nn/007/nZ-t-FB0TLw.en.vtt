I<00:00:40.500> sir<00:00:41.480> and<00:00:42.770> of<00:00:43.770> course<00:00:43.829> you<00:00:44.129> know<00:00:44.250> you<00:00:44.550> you<00:00:44.760> can

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
I sir and of course you know you you can

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.450 
I sir and of course you know you you can
see<00:00:45.210> more<00:00:45.510> of<00:00:45.660> the<00:00:45.840> of<00:00:46.079> a<00:00:46.559> web<00:00:46.770> page<00:00:46.980> on<00:00:47.250> this

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
see more of the of a web page on this

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.700 
see more of the of a web page on this
then<00:00:47.700> you<00:00:47.820> would<00:00:47.969> on<00:00:48.090> say<00:00:48.360> you<00:00:48.510> know<00:00:48.660> 800<00:00:49.140> x<00:00:49.230> 480

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
then you would on say you know 800 x 480

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:59.510 
then you would on say you know 800 x 480
resolution<00:00:49.800> screen

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.460 

and<00:01:00.520> if<00:01:01.510> you<00:01:01.600> haven't<00:01:01.810> figured<00:01:01.900> out<00:01:02.170> there's

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:02.470 
and if you haven't figured out there's

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:05.250 
and if you haven't figured out there's
built-in<00:01:02.800> Wi-Fi<00:01:03.220> and<00:01:03.790> this<00:01:04.570> does<00:01:04.809> use<00:01:04.839> a

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:05.260 
built-in Wi-Fi and this does use a

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.610 
built-in Wi-Fi and this does use a
snappier<00:01:05.890> well<00:01:06.520> a<00:01:06.550> newer<00:01:06.910> version<00:01:07.060> of<00:01:07.870> the

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:08.620 
snappier well a newer version of the

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:10.620 
snappier well a newer version of the
hardware<00:01:09.100> well<00:01:09.550> the<00:01:09.850> reference<00:01:10.240> hardware

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:10.630 
hardware well the reference hardware

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:12.720 
hardware well the reference hardware
that<00:01:11.230> I<00:01:11.290> guess<00:01:11.590> rock<00:01:11.860> ship<00:01:12.070> is<00:01:12.190> designed<00:01:12.370> for

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:12.730 
that I guess rock ship is designed for

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:15.330 
that I guess rock ship is designed for
all<00:01:13.420> these<00:01:13.720> factors<00:01:14.080> to<00:01:14.230> use<00:01:14.410> because<00:01:14.650> you<00:01:15.220> can

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:15.340 
all these factors to use because you can

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.320 
all these factors to use because you can
actually<00:01:15.370> hook<00:01:16.090> on<00:01:16.330> a<00:01:16.950> ethernet<00:01:18.030> adapter<00:01:19.030> here

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:19.330 
actually hook on a ethernet adapter here

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:25.620 
actually hook on a ethernet adapter here
and<00:01:19.540> you<00:01:20.229> can<00:01:20.350> use<00:01:20.700> wired<00:01:21.870> LAN<00:01:22.870> as<00:01:24.000> well<00:01:25.000> and

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:25.630 
and you can use wired LAN as well and

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:33.230 
and you can use wired LAN as well and
see<00:01:25.810> scrolling<00:01:26.440> on<00:01:26.680> this<00:01:26.830> is<00:01:26.979> quite<00:01:27.250> smooth

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.270 

and<00:01:34.240> again<00:01:34.990> the<00:01:35.530> high<00:01:35.650> resolution<00:01:35.920> screen

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:36.280 
and again the high resolution screen

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:38.340 
and again the high resolution screen
really<00:01:36.700> benefits<00:01:37.450> when<00:01:37.720> you<00:01:37.840> know<00:01:37.960> coming<00:01:38.259> to

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:38.350 
really benefits when you know coming to

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:41.130 
really benefits when you know coming to
read<00:01:38.619> texts<00:01:39.490> and<00:01:39.640> stuff<00:01:39.910> it<00:01:40.149> just<00:01:40.810> it's<00:01:41.050> just

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:41.140 
read texts and stuff it just it's just

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:47.490 
read texts and stuff it just it's just
much<00:01:41.440> more<00:01:41.590> sharper<00:01:42.130> I<00:01:45.840> can<00:01:46.840> see<00:01:47.050> web<00:01:47.290> page<00:01:47.470> is

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:47.500 
much more sharper I can see web page is

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.160 
much more sharper I can see web page is
just<00:01:48.180> more<00:01:49.180> nicely<00:01:49.450> displayed<00:01:49.780> on<00:01:50.080> this

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:50.170 
just more nicely displayed on this

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:56.980 
just more nicely displayed on this
higher<00:01:50.380> resolution<00:01:50.979> screen

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:56.990 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:11.300

haven't tested it but I've definitely
used<00:03:12.420> this<00:03:12.660> for<00:03:12.900> about<00:03:12.989> four<00:03:13.530> or<00:03:13.560> five<00:03:13.650> hours

00:03:13.789 --> 00:03:13.799 
used this for about four or five hours

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:18.050 
used this for about four or five hours
now<00:03:14.400> and<00:03:15.560> the<00:03:16.560> power<00:03:16.829> bars<00:03:17.340> only<00:03:17.609> gone<00:03:17.850> down

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
must lie a little bit so this battery is

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.150 
must lie a little bit so this battery is
really<00:03:21.540> really<00:03:21.870> large<00:03:22.109> and<00:03:22.410> you<00:03:22.829> know<00:03:22.920> for

that it just kind of handled the really
high<00:05:09.480> resolution<00:05:10.080> videos<00:05:10.440> but<00:05:11.220> low

high resolution videos but low

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:13.430 
high resolution videos but low
resolution<00:05:12.360> videos<00:05:12.630> you<00:05:12.750> know<00:05:12.840> like<00:05:13.110> in<00:05:13.320> your

800 x 480 resolution play much better on

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:18.770 
800 x 480 resolution play much better on
this<00:05:16.440> so<00:05:16.800> I<00:05:17.490> wouldn't<00:05:18.030> say<00:05:18.150> this<00:05:18.300> is<00:05:18.480> this

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:18.780
