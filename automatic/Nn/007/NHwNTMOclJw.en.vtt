00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.430 
this picture I thought was a lot of fun
I<00:01:55.340> thought<00:01:55.670> that<00:01:56.060> he<00:01:56.720> actually<00:01:56.869> was<00:01:57.289> great

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:57.440 
I thought that he actually was great

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:59.350 
I thought that he actually was great
score<00:01:57.740> was<00:01:57.890> good<00:01:58.039> and<00:01:58.459> a<00:01:58.520> blast<00:01:58.789> I<00:01:59.060> thought

00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.360 
score was good and a blast I thought

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:00.789 
score was good and a blast I thought
that<00:01:59.539> the<00:02:00.049> way<00:02:00.170> they<00:02:00.289> didn't<00:02:00.500> matter<00:02:00.619> is

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:00.799 
that the way they didn't matter is

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:02.680 
that the way they didn't matter is
probably<00:02:01.250> some<00:02:01.520> real-life<00:02:01.700> bad<00:02:02.119> people<00:02:02.509> that

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:02.690 
probably some real-life bad people that

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:04.870 
probably some real-life bad people that
could<00:02:02.869> be<00:02:03.020> oh<00:02:03.289> I<00:02:03.830> think<00:02:03.950> it's<00:02:04.280> fair<00:02:04.549> I<00:02:04.580> don't

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880 
could be oh I think it's fair I don't

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.340 
could be oh I think it's fair I don't
know<00:02:04.970> exactly<00:02:05.270> your<00:02:05.450> sciatic<00:02:05.869> but<00:02:06.020> I<00:02:06.049> like

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:06.350 
know exactly your sciatic but I like

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:08.740 
know exactly your sciatic but I like
that<00:02:06.530> so<00:02:07.490> you<00:02:07.549> didn't<00:02:08.179> think<00:02:08.329> it<00:02:08.390> was<00:02:08.450> as<00:02:08.600> good

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:08.750 
that so you didn't think it was as good

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:11.380 
that so you didn't think it was as good
as<00:02:08.869> a<00:02:08.929> plugin<00:02:09.200> no<00:02:10.130> I<00:02:10.160> enjoyed<00:02:10.850> it<00:02:10.880> living<00:02:11.239> more

I thought they just threw things out

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:17.170 
I thought they just threw things out
randomly<00:02:15.829> at<00:02:16.070> us<00:02:16.220> and<00:02:16.489> we're<00:02:16.940> supposed<00:02:17.030> to

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
just be able to understand it very

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.319 
just be able to understand it very
quickly<00:02:18.799> and<00:02:19.130> especially<00:02:19.760> since<00:02:20.060> there<00:02:20.209> was

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:20.329 
quickly and especially since there was

00:02:20.329 --> 00:02:21.789 
quickly and especially since there was
much<00:02:20.540> iron<00:02:20.720> man<00:02:20.930> they<00:02:21.049> wanted<00:02:21.290> to<00:02:21.380> do<00:02:21.620> more
