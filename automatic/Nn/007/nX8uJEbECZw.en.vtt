re-watch this just like the other ones
uh<00:03:28.250> I<00:03:29.250> would<00:03:29.670> argue<00:03:29.790> this<00:03:29.970> is<00:03:30.920> this<00:03:31.920> is<00:03:32.070> more<00:03:32.310> in

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
uh I would argue this is this is more in

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.070 
uh I would argue this is this is more in
tune<00:03:32.610> with<00:03:32.640> the<00:03:33.030> first<00:03:33.300> trigger<00:03:33.540> the<00:03:33.750> second

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:34.080 
tune with the first trigger the second

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:35.180 
tune with the first trigger the second
one<00:03:34.170> I<00:03:34.200> like<00:03:34.380> the<00:03:34.500> first<00:03:34.740> trailer<00:03:34.890> a<00:03:35.010> bit

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
one I like the first trailer a bit

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:37.160 
one I like the first trailer a bit
better<00:03:35.370> and<00:03:35.940> I<00:03:36.000> think<00:03:36.480> it<00:03:36.720> has<00:03:36.810> to<00:03:36.870> do<00:03:37.020> with

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170 
better and I think it has to do with

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:39.140 
better and I think it has to do with
just<00:03:37.590> the<00:03:37.740> music<00:03:38.040> this<00:03:38.700> one<00:03:38.940> it<00:03:39.030> doesn't

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
just the music this one it doesn't

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:40.670 
just the music this one it doesn't
explain<00:03:39.630> too<00:03:39.840> much<00:03:39.870> about<00:03:39.990> what's<00:03:40.320> happening

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
explain too much about what's happening

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.050 
explain too much about what's happening
because<00:03:40.860> they've<00:03:41.130> covered<00:03:41.370> it<00:03:41.610> in<00:03:41.640> the<00:03:41.820> fruit

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
because they've covered it in the fruit

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:43.400 
because they've covered it in the fruit
and<00:03:42.090> the<00:03:42.300> teaser<00:03:42.540> trailer<00:03:42.870> in<00:03:42.990> the<00:03:43.020> first<00:03:43.290> two

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:43.410
