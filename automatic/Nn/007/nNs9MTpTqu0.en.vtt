the two dances together in a very unique

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.779 
the two dances together in a very unique
way<00:01:26.820> that<00:01:27.780> I<00:01:27.810> that<00:01:28.440> I<00:01:28.470> think<00:01:28.830> is<00:01:29.039> relevant

00:01:29.779 --> 00:01:29.789 
way that I that I think is relevant

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:33.290 
way that I that I think is relevant
because<00:01:30.180> both<00:01:30.690> dances<00:01:31.229> are<00:01:31.940> inspired<00:01:32.940> by

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:33.300 
because both dances are inspired by

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:36.139 
because both dances are inspired by
different<00:01:34.140> cultures<00:01:34.319> and<00:01:34.800> they<00:01:35.610> carry<00:01:35.940> the

00:01:36.139 --> 00:01:36.149 
different cultures and they carry the

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:39.260 
different cultures and they carry the
same<00:01:36.300> traditions<00:01:36.899> they're<00:01:37.170> both<00:01:38.149> dances<00:01:39.149> that

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
same traditions they're both dances that

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.149 
same traditions they're both dances that
started<00:01:39.600> in<00:01:39.720> New<00:01:39.810> York<00:01:40.020> City<00:01:40.200> so<00:01:40.770> it<00:01:40.979> makes

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
started in New York City so it makes

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:50.020 
started in New York City so it makes
