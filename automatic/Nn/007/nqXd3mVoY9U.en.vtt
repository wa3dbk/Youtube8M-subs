00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:27.210
 now in the news you will know how the embrapa pigs and birds arrived at 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.430
 system of family pig production and what this means in terms of 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:34.550
 of markets 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:38.400
 was a model of system of transactions made without the preventive use before 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:42.710
 it's up to us texas concerns and well being has been studied for three years 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:44.260
 by embrapa swine and birds 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:48.470
 the basis of the system and the pressure of the children in the family, one 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:51.660
 objective not to separate employees after fainting 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.260
 keeping the family of brothers in the same barreto birth to slaughter the crisis 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.830
 born in the family is the system that provides greater welfare to animals 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.780
 lower levels of stress and health conditions that are better suited to 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:09.250
 recommendations for the use of this system is for producers who have 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:11.780
 full cycle at low scale 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.610
 ie for churches with up to about 60 array 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:19.270
 is a system that this is music finalizing the researches nÃ© 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:23.980
 and it is intended primarily to producers and low-scale producers 

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:27.090
 family members wishing to produce pigs 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:30.130
 reduced menu holidays 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:32.840
 but with a better quality of animals 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:38.330
 The basic principle is to keep the same litde god from birth until the 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:43.900
 slaughter of the litter after weaning only separates the 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:46.900
 these readers go with the testing phase 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:49.229
 the brothers, right? 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.160
 he added that growth and mining then 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:56.730
 to GM at a time if he 

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:00.520
 during the creation phase the preview of preview is just to give a message the 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.500
 Brazil in the last decades 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.330
 it was during this period that the country reached the fourth largest brand will be the future 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:09.340
 international recognition of the 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.219
 you will see the achievements of its intensive industrial culture 

00:02:13.219 --> 00:02:17.099
 practiced by agroindustries and irresponsible for almost everything that 

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:18.939
 we meet at the supermarket 

00:02:18.939 --> 00:02:22.039
 with three ball games are dying out 

00:02:22.039 --> 00:02:25.669
 to meet this market the sercomtel must bet on the scale of production 

00:02:25.669 --> 00:02:29.859
 which means putting a maximum of 100 best sellers on the property 

00:02:29.859 --> 00:02:32.859
 this increases the possibility of occurrence of health problems 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:37.279
 so it is necessary to use in strategic preventive treatments 

00:02:37.279 --> 00:02:40.309
 to ensure the health of animals 

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:43.909
 production losses is the main difference for the 

00:02:43.909 --> 00:02:45.910
 small-scale family production 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:50.480
 this year with 35 slowly various scenes mixing in the name of the ethics of 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:54.400
 defeat is native that my patience of the champions to 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.320
 mention the preventive treatments because the animals get loose the life 

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:59.019
 entire 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:03.969
 stress levels of animals and more so they are less 

00:03:03.969 --> 00:03:05.759
 to trigger diseases 

00:03:05.759 --> 00:03:09.279
 Acute Embrapa pork and poultry researchers began studies of the 

00:03:09.279 --> 00:03:14.429
 production of family pigs in 2008 only billions of the 41 lots 

00:03:14.429 --> 00:03:15.700
 produced 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.529
 had to be medicated in a therapeutic way 

00:03:18.529 --> 00:03:21.529
 this for five days due to respiratory problems 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:26.069
 this shows that the low density in maui the coexistence in family is 

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:29.900
 animal welfare to the normal risks of 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:31.259
 Large scale 

00:03:31.259 --> 00:03:34.809
 the developed production model is recommended for the small producer 

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:38.659
 and because it is more economical and adds in itself 

00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:42.540
 besides the reduction of the use of medicines presents indices of 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:46.209
 performance of animals similar to those obtained by industrial farms 

00:03:47.139 --> 00:03:52.290
 even in a smaller production comune system one needs to be attentive amnesties 

00:03:52.289 --> 00:03:56.119
 procedures of 100 units the production quality must be the same 

00:03:56.119 --> 00:03:59.749
 regardless of the type of system chosen by your control 

00:04:12.619 --> 00:04:16.720
 beja we will now know in the second part of our report the 

00:04:16.719 --> 00:04:19.920
 procedures to be adopted by producers 

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:23.580
 to maintain the family pig system and to offer the market with a 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:26.669
 differentiated product 

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:30.229
 after your family vacation, another difference is in the procedures 

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:33.020
 adopted by producers 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:38.479
 for animal welfare in this system the cassation of piglets for example 

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:40.059
 is done by means of a vaccine 

00:04:40.059 --> 00:04:43.399
 there is also no need to cut 

00:04:43.999 --> 00:04:45.779
 the post office pib of switzerland 

00:04:45.779 --> 00:04:50.079
 but the fights and disputes are smaller than in the intensive system with mixing of 

00:04:50.079 --> 00:04:51.559
 voters 

00:04:51.559 --> 00:04:54.580
 visibility is also very important in this system 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:56.830
 as well as the other 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:01.229
 the size and style of production does not interfere with the basic care of 

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:02.389
 biosafety 

00:05:02.389 --> 00:05:05.439
 the production of cereals as a family is perfectly viable 

00:05:05.439 --> 00:05:07.300
 expensive for small producers 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:10.840
 as an alternative to adding other offers on the market a product 

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:12.400
 differentiated 

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:16.220
 The system of production and family is simple and consists of the 

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:18.330
 dairy at the same mark 

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:20.349
 it refers to the production 

00:05:20.349 --> 00:05:23.180
 the glasses are divided into rooms 

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:24.860
 the stages of production 

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:28.259
 jesus and motherhood grew growth and termination 

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:31.669
 the same way as in the intensive systems 

00:05:31.669 --> 00:05:34.669
 but also works the same way as the system 

00:05:35.629 --> 00:05:40.270
 the industrial one we have a single group as you can see here behind 

00:05:41.409 --> 00:05:46.409
 is we have is bank in the room are the inclusion of rdal production stage 

00:05:46.409 --> 00:05:48.289
 but we have a room for 

00:05:48.289 --> 00:05:51.949
 gestation bressan legislation we have a room with maternity 

00:05:52.749 --> 00:05:56.569
 we have a pac split room and we have a room for growth and termination 

00:05:57.469 --> 00:06:01.139
 there is no difference in terms of the production system of the 

00:06:01.139 --> 00:06:04.309
 system will still be the 

00:06:04.309 --> 00:06:09.909
 the largest difference having an energy that is emitted at 270 

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:13.009
 was important the presence of the children and family 

00:06:13.009 --> 00:06:15.659
 is to respect the maintenance of the litter 

00:06:15.659 --> 00:06:20.410
 and be aware that the procedures and care are the same as any 

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:21.969
 I want another system 

00:06:21.969 --> 00:06:25.839
 small to large producer should always ice cream previous 

00:06:25.839 --> 00:06:27.169
 production safety 

00:06:27.169 --> 00:06:30.169
 before it was animal welfare 

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:42.969
 well to know more about the subject I got in touch with the troops 

00:06:42.969 --> 00:06:46.409
 - day 10 in concord there in santa catarina next question 

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:49.270
 according to daily 49 

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:53.689
 the number as 4 4 will be 400 

00:06:53.689 --> 00:06:56.900
 contact can also be made by e-mail in this case 

00:06:56.900 --> 00:07:00.349
 the address of the first deputy sarkozy the company 

00:07:00.349 --> 00:07:02.120
 has inhibited Persia 

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:03.539
