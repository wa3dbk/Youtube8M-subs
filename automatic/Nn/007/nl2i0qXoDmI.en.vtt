you've seen on the Nissan Sunny the car
looks<00:00:38.040> more<00:00:38.190> proportionate<00:00:38.760> up<00:00:38.879> front<00:00:39.180> the

sort of hemmed in by this nice chrome
treatment<00:00:46.440> the<00:00:46.950> front<00:00:47.219> grille<00:00:47.520> nice<00:00:48.270> and

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
treatment the front grille nice and

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.540 
treatment the front grille nice and
butch<00:00:48.840> it's<00:00:49.079> just<00:00:49.289> like<00:00:49.500> the<00:00:49.680> pulse<00:00:50.100> of<00:00:50.309> course

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
butch it's just like the pulse of course

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.069 
butch it's just like the pulse of course
so<00:00:50.730> it's<00:00:50.820> not<00:00:50.910> like<00:00:51.120> you<00:00:51.210> haven't<00:00:51.360> seen<00:00:51.570> it<00:00:51.719> but

which is of course no no's design team

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.790 
which is of course no no's design team
in<00:00:59.850> Mumbai<00:01:00.239> along<00:01:00.899> the<00:01:01.050> side<00:01:01.260> is<00:01:01.469> where<00:01:01.649> you

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
in Mumbai along the side is where you

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.470 
in Mumbai along the side is where you
realize<00:01:02.100> that<00:01:02.399> this<00:01:02.609> Cinderella<00:01:03.090> wasn't<00:01:03.390> that

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
realize that this Cinderella wasn't that

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:04.910 
realize that this Cinderella wasn't that
pretty<00:01:03.660> to<00:01:03.899> begin<00:01:04.019> with<00:01:04.290> so<00:01:04.409> you<00:01:04.470> can<00:01:04.500> doll<00:01:04.799> her

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
pretty to begin with so you can doll her

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.070 
pretty to begin with so you can doll her
up<00:01:05.100> a<00:01:05.189> little<00:01:05.400> bit<00:01:05.519> but<00:01:06.030> you<00:01:06.570> know<00:01:06.600> what<00:01:06.840> she's

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
up a little bit but you know what she's

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:07.820 
up a little bit but you know what she's
still<00:01:07.260> gonna<00:01:07.380> look<00:01:07.530> a<00:01:07.590> little<00:01:07.680> bit

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
still gonna look a little bit

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.310 
still gonna look a little bit
disproportionate<00:01:08.010> because<00:01:08.790> well<00:01:09.510> it<00:01:09.810> is<00:01:09.990> just

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
disproportionate because well it is just

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.109 
disproportionate because well it is just
like<00:01:10.470> the<00:01:10.560> Nissan<00:01:10.860> Sunny<00:01:11.100> on<00:01:11.340> the<00:01:11.460> sides<00:01:11.700> the

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
like the Nissan Sunny on the sides the

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:13.460 
like the Nissan Sunny on the sides the
car<00:01:12.299> looks<00:01:12.510> a<00:01:12.600> little<00:01:12.689> too<00:01:12.900> stretched<00:01:13.260> in<00:01:13.439> the

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
car looks a little too stretched in the

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.260 
car looks a little too stretched in the
middle<00:01:13.740> and<00:01:13.890> of<00:01:14.310> course<00:01:14.580> that<00:01:14.729> is<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:14.970> Micra

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
middle and of course that is the Micra

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.480 
middle and of course that is the Micra
platform<00:01:15.750> that's<00:01:16.290> getting<00:01:16.770> that<00:01:16.920> extra<00:01:17.159> very

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
platform that's getting that extra very

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.700 
platform that's getting that extra very
base<00:01:17.700> gives<00:01:18.540> you<00:01:18.659> tons<00:01:18.930> of<00:01:19.170> space<00:01:19.409> on<00:01:19.619> the

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
base gives you tons of space on the

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.890 
base gives you tons of space on the
inside<00:01:19.860> that<00:01:20.250> is<00:01:20.369> the<00:01:20.490> big<00:01:20.580> USP<00:01:21.000> all<00:01:21.630> of<00:01:21.810> this

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
inside that is the big USP all of this

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.300 
inside that is the big USP all of this
is<00:01:22.049> common<00:01:22.380> to<00:01:22.470> the<00:01:22.560> sunny<00:01:22.770> so<00:01:22.950> I<00:01:22.979> don't<00:01:23.189> need

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
is common to the sunny so I don't need

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.609 
is common to the sunny so I don't need
to<00:01:23.400> repeat<00:01:23.700> this<00:01:23.880> so<00:01:24.450> larger<00:01:25.080> tires<00:01:25.350> may<00:01:25.500> have

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
to repeat this so larger tires may have

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.560 
to repeat this so larger tires may have
looked<00:01:25.770> nicer<00:01:26.100> true<00:01:26.310> though<00:01:26.460> now<00:01:27.000> at<00:01:27.270> the<00:01:27.420> back

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
looked nicer true though now at the back

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.319 
looked nicer true though now at the back
is<00:01:27.810> where<00:01:28.020> again<00:01:28.460> the<00:01:29.460> Scala<00:01:29.700> tends<00:01:30.000> to<00:01:30.119> look<00:01:30.240> a

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
is where again the Scala tends to look a

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.319 
is where again the Scala tends to look a
lot<00:01:30.630> better<00:01:30.869> than<00:01:31.020> the<00:01:31.229> sunny<00:01:31.500> because

00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:32.329 
lot better than the sunny because

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:34.370 
lot better than the sunny because
remember<00:01:33.329> how<00:01:33.479> I<00:01:33.509> always<00:01:33.869> said<00:01:34.020> it's<00:01:34.140> a<00:01:34.229> very

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
remember how I always said it's a very

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.770 
remember how I always said it's a very
bulbous<00:01:34.619> very<00:01:35.189> odd<00:01:35.430> shaped<00:01:35.850> very<00:01:36.360> stretched

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
bulbous very odd shaped very stretched

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.200 
bulbous very odd shaped very stretched
sort<00:01:37.140> of<00:01:37.200> a<00:01:37.259> boot<00:01:37.470> well<00:01:37.950> this<00:01:38.159> one<00:01:38.369> is<00:01:38.579> a<00:01:38.640> lot

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
sort of a boot well this one is a lot

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.510 
sort of a boot well this one is a lot
more<00:01:39.240> attractive<00:01:39.630> the<00:01:40.439> nice<00:01:40.829> big<00:01:41.100> thick<00:01:41.369> of

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
more attractive the nice big thick of

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.219 
more attractive the nice big thick of
thick<00:01:41.939> strip<00:01:42.540> of<00:01:42.659> chrome<00:01:42.840> is<00:01:42.869> actually

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
thick strip of chrome is actually

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:44.899 
thick strip of chrome is actually
complementary<00:01:44.009> in<00:01:44.130> this<00:01:44.280> case<00:01:44.460> I<00:01:44.579> like<00:01:44.729> the

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
complementary in this case I like the

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.910 
complementary in this case I like the
way<00:01:45.000> it's<00:01:45.119> been<00:01:45.210> done<00:01:45.420> Scala<00:01:46.229> has<00:01:46.590> of<00:01:46.770> course

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
way it's been done Scala has of course

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.069 
way it's been done Scala has of course
been<00:01:47.240> embossed<00:01:48.240> into<00:01:48.420> that<00:01:48.659> somewhat<00:01:48.960> like

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:09.500

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030

the<00:03:15.530> strategy<00:03:15.949> on<00:03:16.129> pricing<00:03:17.590> yes<00:03:18.590> okay<00:03:19.040> so<00:03:19.340> it's

the strategy on pricing yes okay so it's

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:21.460 
the strategy on pricing yes okay so it's
