00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
one one element you know which is poison

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.430 
one one element you know which is poison
obviously<00:01:54.030> because<00:01:54.720> the<00:01:56.720> the<00:01:57.720> fetish<00:01:58.049> poison

00:01:58.430 --> 00:01:58.440

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
% so you're boosting your your your

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.719 
% so you're boosting your your your
fetishes<00:02:04.920> and<00:02:05.399> you're<00:02:05.729> boosting<00:02:05.880> in<00:02:06.180> your<00:02:06.299> own

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:07.729 
fetishes and you're boosting in your own

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:15.229 
fetishes and you're boosting in your own
damage<00:02:08.729> as<00:02:09.030> well<00:02:09.209> and<00:02:11.780> that's<00:02:12.780> cool<00:02:14.120> you<00:02:15.120> can

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:15.239 
damage as well and that's cool you can

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:20.360 
damage as well and that's cool you can
also<00:02:15.390> stack<00:02:16.280> a<00:02:17.280> fetish<00:02:17.959> damage<00:02:18.959> percent<00:02:19.500> which

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
also stack a fetish damage percent which

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.240 
also stack a fetish damage percent which
then<00:02:20.640> double<00:02:21.209> dips<00:02:21.660> into<00:02:21.930> like<00:02:22.220> boosting<00:02:23.220> your

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
then double dips into like boosting your

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.900 
then double dips into like boosting your
fetish<00:02:23.700> damage<00:02:24.120> so<00:02:25.459> that's<00:02:26.459> pretty<00:02:26.730> cool

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
fetish damage so that's pretty cool

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:31.610 
fetish damage so that's pretty cool
that's<00:02:27.510> what<00:02:27.630> I<00:02:27.660> do<00:02:28.400> don't<00:02:29.840> stack<00:02:30.840> poison<00:02:31.380> dart

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
that's what I do don't stack poison dart

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:36.979 
that's what I do don't stack poison dart
I<00:02:31.769> read<00:02:31.980> somewhere<00:02:32.870> that<00:02:35.450> that<00:02:36.450> only<00:02:36.600> boosts

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:36.989 
I read somewhere that that only boosts

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:39.800 
I read somewhere that that only boosts
your<00:02:37.160> poison<00:02:38.160> damage<00:02:38.340> or<00:02:38.880> your<00:02:39.239> poison<00:02:39.630> dart

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
your poison damage or your poison dart

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.330 
your poison damage or your poison dart
damage<00:02:40.310> so

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.580 

that's<00:02:44.340> not<00:02:44.519> very<00:02:44.610> good<00:02:44.849> because<00:02:45.810> a<00:02:46.200> lot<00:02:46.560> of

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
that's not very good because a lot of

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.349 
that's not very good because a lot of
your<00:02:46.739> damages<00:02:47.159> is<00:02:47.340> coming<00:02:47.640> from<00:02:47.730> the<00:02:47.819> fetishes

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:48.359 
your damages is coming from the fetishes

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:52.069 
your damages is coming from the fetishes
and<00:02:48.390> their<00:02:48.719> darts<00:02:49.310> so<00:02:50.450> instead<00:02:51.450> of<00:02:51.510> if<00:02:51.900> you

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:52.079 
and their darts so instead of if you

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:55.220 
and their darts so instead of if you
have<00:02:52.260> poison<00:02:52.769> dart<00:02:53.269> percent<00:02:54.269> on<00:02:54.390> your<00:02:54.569> years<00:02:54.840> i

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
have poison dart percent on your years i

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.849 
have poison dart percent on your years i
would<00:02:55.620> suggest<00:02:55.859> taking<00:02:56.549> that<00:02:56.670> off<00:02:56.730> and

00:02:57.849 --> 00:02:57.859 
would suggest taking that off and

00:02:57.859 --> 00:03:04.339 
would suggest taking that off and
re-rolling<00:02:58.859> for<00:02:59.310> something<00:02:59.609> else

00:03:04.339 --> 00:03:04.349 

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:07.559 

so<00:03:05.349> carnevil<00:03:06.250> does<00:03:06.549> a<00:03:06.580> lot<00:03:06.730> of<00:03:06.790> damage<00:03:07.030> I'm<00:03:07.420> not

00:03:07.559 --> 00:03:07.569 
so carnevil does a lot of damage I'm not

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:12.420 
so carnevil does a lot of damage I'm not

00:03:34.809 --> 00:03:34.819 
with the fire build you kind of have

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:39.690 
with the fire build you kind of have
weaker<00:03:35.180> pets<00:03:35.830> but<00:03:36.830> like<00:03:37.010> stronger<00:03:38.110> attacks

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.700 
weaker pets but like stronger attacks

your<00:03:40.700> own<00:03:40.819> and<00:03:41.810> then<00:03:42.200> with<00:03:42.319> the<00:03:42.410> physical

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:42.560 
your own and then with the physical

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:45.280 
your own and then with the physical
build<00:03:43.010> but<00:03:43.250> your<00:03:43.549> attacks<00:03:43.879> suck<00:03:44.239> but<00:03:45.170> your

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:45.290 
build but your attacks suck but your

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:48.820 
build but your attacks suck but your
fetishes<00:03:45.650> are<00:03:46.040> like<00:03:46.400> super<00:03:47.120> buff<00:03:47.360> and<00:03:48.140> like

in between I think it's got its own
problems<00:03:54.739> though<00:03:55.069> cuz<00:03:56.620> these<00:03:58.420> fetishes

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:00.400 
problems though cuz these fetishes

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:05.020 
problems though cuz these fetishes
