00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:12.750
 now let's go here reason welcome to the 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.879
 channel and welcome to a new top 5 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.680
 videogames this time we're going to 

00:00:14.879 --> 00:00:18.450
 treat a topic that I suggested state you 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.610
 themselves last week that it seems that 

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:22.440
 you liked that it has to do with the five 

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:24.390
 most addictive video games that exist 

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:26.430
 of course I will try to be for a 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.680
 objective side is to say having in 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.690
 Count the numbers of players 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.489
 habitual who have different titles 

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:33.960
 keep in mind that and also by 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.940
 course in my personal opinion of 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.530
 what have been for me the videogames 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.780
 more addictive so try a little 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.429
 be realistic of course so I hope 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.469
 that you like it and if you have any other 

00:00:41.429 --> 00:00:44.909
 different opinion do not hesitate to leave it 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.489
 in the comments as well as suggestions 

00:00:44.909 --> 00:00:49.829
 for next 25 video games so 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.300
 nothing more and we are going directly to comment 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.670
 which are in my opinion the five 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.409
 most addictive video games start in 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.789
 the fifth position with the video game of 

00:00:55.409 --> 00:00:59.429
 minecraft and is that I play 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.989
 practically anything that the 

00:00:59.429 --> 00:01:03.089
 most of you like me 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.129
 had a stage in which what I know 

00:01:03.089 --> 00:01:07.350
 I wanted to play minecraft really not 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.450
 you know how analysis happens to you 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.090
 so fast building practically 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.070
 anything any bullshit in the 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.720
 loneliness of your world that then to both 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.190
 days you're really going to erase it but 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.619
 now yes son if you spend the hours 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:21.030
 flying was practically hallucinatory 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.890
 lately for example I do not play 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.840
 much to minecraft but it's true that 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.240
 I had a time which started hours 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:30.479
 and hours and hours playing without meaning and 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.920
 we have not had a great time either but 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.619
 I noticed that the hours passed 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.780
 for that reason in the fifth position I 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.670
 I liked it I would like to put minecraft and 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.050
 I hope I imagine that some of 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.429
 you will also think like me that 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:43.860
 it is certainly one of the most addictive 

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:45.929
 of this video game even though it is a 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.700
 very simple mechanics if we go now with 

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:49.409
 the fourth position and in this place I 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.420
 I wanted to place the videogame the league 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:53.970
 of legends one of the titles that most 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:57.000
 fame is catching lately imagine 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:59.130
 what is said fame that even in the USA 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.080
 they have begun to record sport 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.580
 national in the same way that it could be 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:04.530
 any other Olympic sport and of 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:06.869
 done you can get a scholarship in the 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.670
 university for being a player but you 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:11.530
 I say play is something curious, of course, and 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:14.080
 good on the subject of addiction 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.580
 I imagine that many of you will know that 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.680
 you play alico players you will know 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:19.540
 typical friend who said no I will not play 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.940
 never friends players I do not 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:24.370
 would hook that and soon return 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:26.319
 to be there and in fact the mechanics of 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:28.870
 game is pretty addictive of course 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:31.450
 it's very simple not to enter the typical 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:33.340
 debate that league of legends is better 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.660
 of endow I will not go into that or 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:36.670
 very much less simply means 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:38.770
 which is very addictive the video game is a 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:41.110
 very simple mechanics and that you enjoy 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:43.330
 when with friends at last the incentives 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:45.340
 needed to convert it back into 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:46.900
 one of the most addictive video games in 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.489
 my opinion now we continue with the 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.650
 third position and this time 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:52.450
 I wanted to mention one of the sagas more 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:55.120
 known from the world of video games 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:56.680
 it's about the pokemon franchise without 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.690
 doubt one of the most addictive 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.160
 also of course not only is 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:01.870
 saying I did not want to keep a single 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:04.209
 videogame regarding addiction issue 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:06.130
 but practically the ones that you have 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:08.140
 my age or even a little bit less 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:10.120
 bit safer than in your 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:11.950
 childhood have played many areas to 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:14.140
 the different pokémons and I can 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:16.000
 imagine that they were the games that most 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:18.489
 mine at that time and the most 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.010
 addictive is true that currently not 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:23.170
 Pokemon is as successful as it is 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:24.730
 years but generally follow 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:26.799
 being just as addictive and I for 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:28.870
 example I have them I get a pokémon 

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:30.640
 downloaded on the mobile and practically 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:32.620
 that logic that I play when I'm out 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:35.049
 with the travel phone or whatever 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:37.570
 so for that very reason the third 

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:39.730
 position for two years good this had 

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:41.890
 pokemon and non-addictive that is I wanted 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:43.989
 place it in that position let's now move to 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:45.760
 the second position and in this case we 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:48.100
 we will find a game that 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:50.049
 be a great title with a great argument 

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:52.450
 not much less, except with a 

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:54.880
 simple and straightforward simple video game 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:56.920
 it's about angry birds another one of the titles 

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:59.620
 also most striking and certainly 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:01.660
 if you have a mobile or a tablet 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:03.130
 computer anything sure that 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:05.230
 have you ever played it and good 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:07.090
 because the mechanics are so simple and so 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:08.799
 addictive that this is precisely what 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:10.239
 makes us play so much for that very reason 

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:12.250
 competition place it in the second 

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:14.170
 position who has not lost the zones 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:16.870
 dead from the university about the 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:19.090
 library playing the di bert from 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:21.459
 then I do that it is 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:22.810
 that another perhaps too many and already for 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:24.130
 finish in the first place I wanted to 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:26.410
 place a video game in which you do not 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:28.570
 He has spoken on countless occasions and 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:30.580
 that undoubtedly in my opinion would be 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:33.250
 the maximum reference as a video game 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:35.380
 what have I done to steal your life 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:37.750
 it's about forgiveness of world of warcraft and 

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:40.240
 is that I have told you many times the 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:44.080
 of hours and hours not to say weeks and 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:46.000
 days and months in short anything much 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:47.800
 time in short too much time I have 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.210
 inverted me throughout my life 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:50.710
 playing world of warcraft and 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:53.139
 currently so that those who ask 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:55.450
 I do not play it by luck as it says 

00:04:53.139 --> 00:04:58.270
 but of course subtitle that despite 

00:04:55.450 --> 00:05:00.010
 of the fact that you have to pay for 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:02.200
 play it at least if you play in a 

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:04.840
 official yet even though you could 

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:06.550
 have a snag you do not care as who 

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:08.320
 it says when you're playing it and you 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:10.840
 hooks more and more and more is a 

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:12.160
 video game that encourages you to follow 

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:14.440
 playing and that of course what 

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:16.840
 get many challenges much more variety 

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:19.120
 very large subtitle that to which 

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:20.860
 you can spend many hours and for 

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:23.020
 I think that's what it is 

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:24.550
 becomes so addictive but good at 

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:25.240
 I hope you agree with me 

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:27.669
 in this 

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:29.620
 in this case I do not know the truth if 

00:05:27.669 --> 00:05:31.930
 you will think like me but for that you have 

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:33.819
 the comments below so you can tell me 

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:35.770
 know what are in your opinion the 

00:05:33.819 --> 00:05:37.300
 most addictive games or which ones you have 

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:39.099
 dedicated more hours throughout your 

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:40.990
 life sure someone tells me Carlos 

00:05:39.099 --> 00:05:42.610
 of you but good in the end I hope that you 

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:44.530
 have liked this top 5 video games in 

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:47.050
 my opinion these are the five titles 

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:49.300
 most have caught me along 

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:51.789
 the last years of my life so 

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:54.270
 I hope you liked it and happy and 

00:05:51.789 --> 00:05:54.270
 see you
