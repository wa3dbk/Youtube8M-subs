00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
project one of the problems with a lot

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.639 
project one of the problems with a lot
of<00:01:50.909> disclosure<00:01:51.600> movements<00:01:52.110> and<00:01:52.229> things<00:01:52.439> like

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
of disclosure movements and things like

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.760 
of disclosure movements and things like
that<00:01:52.710> is<00:01:53.159> that<00:01:53.570> it's<00:01:54.570> an<00:01:54.750> external<00:01:55.259> process

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
that is that it's an external process

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.429 
that is that it's an external process
and<00:01:56.040> if<00:01:56.820> you're<00:01:57.000> going<00:01:57.240> to<00:01:57.390> experience<00:01:57.810> ultra

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
and if you're going to experience ultra

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.200 
and if you're going to experience ultra
dimensional<00:01:58.950> and<00:01:59.130> interdimensional<00:01:59.520> beings

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
dimensional and interdimensional beings

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.539 
dimensional and interdimensional beings
it's<00:02:00.630> an<00:02:00.810> inward<00:02:01.200> experience<00:02:02.070> and<00:02:02.310> an<00:02:02.399> inner

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
it's an inward experience and an inner

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.700 
it's an inward experience and an inner
process<00:02:03.119> it's<00:02:03.299> a<00:02:03.450> spiritual<00:02:03.990> experience<00:02:04.079> and

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
process it's a spiritual experience and

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.130 
process it's a spiritual experience and
so<00:02:05.579> without<00:02:05.909> that<00:02:05.969> we're<00:02:06.659> only<00:02:06.780> getting<00:02:06.990> a

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
so without that we're only getting a

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.490 
so without that we're only getting a
