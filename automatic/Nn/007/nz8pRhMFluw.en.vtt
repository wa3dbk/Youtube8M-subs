00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.690
 we will do a thesis of the scan of the epson 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:11.120
 xp 202 to start so we are in 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:15.690
 office mode 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:21.990
 after we are 1,300 farting and going 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:29.090
 to launch first so a preview is 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:29.090
 party at knew mongrain 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.480
 you see they make little time when 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.230
 it's been a long time since he started 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.230
 his scan 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:47.809
 so 20 seconds 20 seconds when there 

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:50.840
 has a cannon him in 7 seconds and 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:53.839
 scan the thing so there now we 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:57.949
 will press digitized so there we 

00:00:53.839 --> 00:01:00.800
 are in pdf mode and we are going 

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:08.180
 press hawkeye and at the same time 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:12.710
 lens the clock so we are of course 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:14.000
 the exhibition 2 and it's gone so I 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:15.140
 will tell you a little joke 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.420
 to wait 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:20.509
 then these two snails that show a 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:25.100
 wall he goes up he goes up he's at the smur and 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:29.330
 monte monte monte monte oh there there me 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:33.289
 monte monte ascends and that figure and ascends 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:37.009
 monte monte has arrived in there is one of 

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:39.170
 two who says well we drooled 1 

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:42.080
 so here you have seen that but 32 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:46.750
 seconds up to prisches 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:50.500
 so here we have files saved 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.500
 as simple yet 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:58.390
 ok we close a little files on 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:02.260
 file and here's them that's what we 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:06.340
 did this here so files for a 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:07.920
 very good result all that was those 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:13.150
 before they are removed 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:18.520
 because of the fact of tests before so there 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:24.160
 we're going to do we're going to digitize again but 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:37.300
 we are going to make the pictures in pictures so these 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:40.300
 fears that I launched so the time in 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:42.910
 does it be the same it will be in 32 33 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:44.040
 seconds in fact so a riddle for 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:47.410
 urge someone to wait 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:52.030
 dorian stormy how is death 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:54.720
 the captain still hooks ten seconds 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:03:01.810
 pretty much how died the captain 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:03:05.790
 hook by scratching them here is this 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.790
 we are finished 33 seconds 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:14.739
 result is here then the result 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:21.180
 I find it very good for 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:25.959
 buses approached a little chamomile 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:29.530
 it's summer knowing that it's the buttocks 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:32.370
 the pwa hand the pen the pen test 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:32.370
 single track 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:38.850
 that's the test is done and then and then 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.850
 and then here are kisses
