00:00:09.519 --> 00:00:14.589
 in the people how are your ricardo 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:16.810
 roadmap with another hard dress video 

00:00:14.589 --> 00:00:19.180
 rain in minecraft not everything is for the 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:22.750
 field and good to see here I bring you a 

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:26.020
 tutorial on how to generate to make a 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:29.009
 Very fast buff combustion generator 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:29.009
 work here very much 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:36.630
 as soon as peak comes out in a hurry for the other 

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:40.410
 side then you do not stop snacking on a 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:42.460
 time and follow me 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:46.450
 I will show you how to do it is very 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:48.760
 easy only we need good 

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:53.440
 we need two lava cubes two 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:57.700
 veins of water redstone torches east of 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:01:01.559
 network are two normal pistons two 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:04.330
 sticky pistons two repeaters and ya 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.760
 ok let's do it from the beginning in 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:11.110
 this area the first thing we have to 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:15.700
 do is break the floor two by two 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:18.280
 a space two by two and in that space 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.920
 do two more holes is going to stay and so 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:23.220
 like a ladder 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:26.710
 ok now with the help of some material not 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:29.860
 that you can not burn the stone 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:34.000
 or not that land is going to make this 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:35.480
 form one in this corner another one in this 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.860
 corner 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:41.600
 2 in the middle and others in that corner behind 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:44.560
 of what we did we are going to put a 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.560
 2 x 2 wall 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:50.310
 ok so 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:55.240
 here we are going to put a block a block 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:59.979
 a block and a block and we remove this 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:04.270
 ok same side one block one block one 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:06.729
 block a block and we remove this ok 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:11.270
 now with the torches let's start 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:13.990
 to put one here here 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:13.990
 here 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.560
 here 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:23.530
 here here and in this space 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:29.260
 in these here are going to go two torches ok 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:32.920
 now the pistons on that wall we're going to 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:37.630
 put a floor here and a piston here 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:37.630
 but let's put the jobs 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:45.280
 the steps go one on top one of 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:46.720
 up and now if these are already put 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.290
 normal 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:53.540
 ok they would be this way 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:55.760
 now let's put the red stone and 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:03:00.010
 repeater 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:03.819
 the repeated ones said one here and one here 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:08.030
 network are here this network are here network 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:11.090
 they are here a network are 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:13.370
 and a restaurant although now we're going to 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:14.670
 put the water always first the water 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:17.040
 before the lava 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:20.010
 here and here ok 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.430
 after the lava we are going to put it in this 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:24.960
 space 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:27.200
 in these two cubes 1 and 2 

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:30.200
 and will immediately start working 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:30.200
 okay 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.209
 because that stretch when it gets here 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:36.700
 because this blocking is what it is 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:38.980
 the signal that gives him the torch then 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:42.129
 up and separates the same happens here when 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:44.739
 a block is created here the block is blocked 

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:46.659
 signal and stop working the piston 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:49.659
 if I break a block here the 

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:52.120
 signal and activate the pistons in sequence 

00:03:49.659 --> 00:03:54.790
 and so you can generate again the 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:57.609
 Stone is a very simple tutorial and 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:59.590
 It's worth it to get a lot 

00:03:57.609 --> 00:04:01.989
 stone and very fast I hope that you 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:04.840
 serve them you know already in the xxi them 

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:06.340
