00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.509
 what a large number of people in 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:08.460
 Ukraine does not recognize these reforms as their own 

00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:11.910
 sent for their own good in our 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:14.480
 opinion is due to the fact that people in 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:17.310
 the power of inertia of your thinking 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:19.980
 continue to identify Ukraine 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.130
 today's Soviet part of Ukraine 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.619
 social obligations to the people 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:28.429
 you need to understand that Ukraine is Soviet 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:31.619
 Ukraine today is a different country and 

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:33.540
 endure that generational experience when 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:37.829
 state in exchange for the labor of people 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:40.829
 settling the hotel life is not worth it in 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:43.260
 that our country today belongs 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:47.340
 narrow group of billionaire faces and 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:49.739
 multimillionaires and all of them 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.629
 are in power either controls 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:55.460
 power is an integral part 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:57.480
 and has nothing to do with the people 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.670
 starting with the fact that if we take 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.680
 78th constitution ussr 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.000
 it was written that Ukraine 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.570
 nation state 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.750
 our constitution is not with what 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.280
 so proprietors and our country should 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.790
 take on social obligations 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:17.400
 by the content of millions of people who are not 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:20.960
 bring them profits either is not for 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:23.520
 they are either not their source 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:26.820
 protection either is not for them 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:29.490
 source of pleasure look who 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:32.579
 today all those people who live badly 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.829
 could not fit into the service of the owners 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:36.720
 states are all who are today 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:38.880
 attendants state owners live 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.560
 well and do not complain young in every way 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.140
 defend the existing system 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.119
 starting from these vile political scientists with 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.220
 fish names 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:48.890
 overflowing for not owning another and 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:52.350
 finishing up 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:53.850
 stars of theater and cinema and pop nobody 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:57.719
 do not complain unless Povaliy 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:59.600
 complain about life no it doesn't know what 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:01.820
 she is a bad singer she is divine 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.610
 singer but once again I want to suggest that 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:05.409
 all who do not fit into the service of the owners 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:07.790
 country 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:10.100
 complain about their miserable worthless 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:13.280
 life but for what reason 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:16.910
 the owners of our country will take care 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:20.750
 about 14 million retirees about some 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:23.300
 about some large children 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.900
 disabled i don't say when our 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:26.840
 a country 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:29.569
 after all, and factories and infrastructure factories 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.760
 the facilities of the sides is mining 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:34.040
 combine and 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:38.000
 oil refineries quarry mines 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:42.760
 got a few hundred of our family 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:45.680
 the country together with this time the incident of fate 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:48.350
 at the same time they got the population 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:51.110
 but not one is never one owner 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:52.700
 countries did not claim but this population 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:56.690
 they didn't ask him 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:59.000
 and today the main task is 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:00.910
 to quickly and most importantly effectively 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:07.910
 as cheap as possible 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:11.810
 get rid of all this from all those from 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:14.480
 all that is in the zone in the zone 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:16.970
 dying why are we talking fast and 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:20.750
 effectively because first of all 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:22.310
 these people who demand themselves 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:25.090
 social relations by 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:27.530
 states they eat up resources 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:29.209
 daily passing resources i 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:31.940
 repeatedly we said that these there 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:36.230
 all these beggars these teachers there doctors almost 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:40.060
 every day they want to eat secondly they are all 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:42.560
 in the future, again, poor pensioners 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:45.890
 to get rid of them you need that 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:47.299
 do the first to oust them for 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:51.440
 edge of society 

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:53.720
 the first second is to get them 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:54.700
 social retirement savings then we 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.560
 all that there was 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:58.080
 before commitments they before 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:00.819
 first of all did not live 

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:02.860
 referring of course while keeping up the experience 

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:07.090
 most developed countries and living standards 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:11.709
 10 15 20 years higher than ours or 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:15.640
 third is to squeeze them out of the country because 

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:18.430
 that according to the German political 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:20.799
 institute of berlin your appeals for 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:23.139
 for the existing system to enter 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:27.220
 balance in Ukraine with the existing 

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:29.110
 mode under the existing non-batch mode 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:31.660
 Regions not Viktor Fedorovich mode 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:35.260
 mode when you do not exist owners 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:37.810
 countries in Ukraine reconciliation enough 4 and 5 

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:39.419
 million all superfluous should be 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:44.260
 recycled 

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:46.150
 why should millions of ukrainians think 

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:49.630
 what stanza owners need about them 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:53.530
 cares let's think the opposite what 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:57.820
 it's people today have to pay for their 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:59.139
 right to live on their territory so for such 

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:01.210
 posing the question is more 

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:04.960
 correct and we see that the owners 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:07.990
 countries are gradually raising the cost 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:10.120
 life on their territory for what reason are they 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:12.910
 will reduce utility costs when 

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:16.690
 all her power racks all water channels 

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:18.789
 year gases and everything belongs to them why not 

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:21.070
 should lose profit if someone doesn't 

00:05:18.789 --> 00:05:26.380
 can pay you can not pay not 

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:29.350
 take advantage of that from this point 

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:31.150
 view all the reforms that are carried out and 

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:34.690
 will be held in Ukraine are 

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:38.440
 effective and correct because 

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:41.410
 they are aimed at enabling owners 

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:43.630
 States and this their states could 

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:45.510
 make big profits and compete 

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:47.650
 according to the riches of any there 

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:49.630
 slurred hungary lira 

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:51.280
 ideas and wealth compete with 

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:54.009
 Russia UK 

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:57.370
 Germany and USA that is our owners 

00:05:54.009 --> 00:06:00.880
 our country is being challenged by the richest 

00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:04.690
 people of the planet and in all these senses 

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:08.380
 why do we need rural schools for what 

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:11.139
 rural polyclinics what for why why 

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:14.550
 that is, why do we need patients who are not in 

00:06:11.139 --> 00:06:14.550
 able to pay for your treatment
