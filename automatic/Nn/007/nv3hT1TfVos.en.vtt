00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:44.829 
here this is called a trust support now

00:01:44.829 --> 00:01:46.200 
here this is called a trust support now
I<00:01:45.039> don't<00:01:45.159> suppose<00:01:45.399> who<00:01:45.579> ever<00:01:45.729> thought<00:01:45.939> we'd<00:01:46.119> be

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:46.210 
I don't suppose who ever thought we'd be

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:47.580 
I don't suppose who ever thought we'd be
talking<00:01:46.450> about<00:01:46.600> trust<00:01:46.929> supports<00:01:47.380> in<00:01:47.499> the

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:47.590 
talking about trust supports in the

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:49.709 
talking about trust supports in the
gardening<00:01:47.920> program<00:01:48.369> certainly<00:01:49.270> not<00:01:49.539> when

we're<00:01:49.840> not<00:01:49.929> double<00:01:50.289> digging<00:01:50.619> but<00:01:50.890> this<00:01:51.340> is<00:01:51.670> a

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:51.880 
we're not double digging but this is a

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.630 
we're not double digging but this is a
trust<00:01:52.179> support<00:01:52.659> it's<00:01:53.289> a<00:01:53.469> tiny<00:01:53.799> piece<00:01:54.609> of

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:54.640 
trust support it's a tiny piece of

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.739 
trust support it's a tiny piece of
plastic<00:01:55.259> it's<00:01:56.259> rigid<00:01:57.090> to<00:01:58.090> all<00:01:58.210> intents<00:01:58.600> and

00:01:58.739 --> 00:01:58.749 
plastic it's rigid to all intents and

00:01:58.749 --> 00:02:00.870 
plastic it's rigid to all intents and
well<00:01:58.960> it's<00:01:59.079> not<00:01:59.140> rigid<00:01:59.619> at<00:01:59.740> least<00:01:59.979> it's<00:02:00.670> very

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
well it's not rigid at least it's very

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.690 
well it's not rigid at least it's very
stiff<00:02:01.719> but<00:02:02.020> it<00:02:02.649> bends<00:02:02.890> along<00:02:03.069> the<00:02:03.280> bottom<00:02:03.429> and

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:03.700 
stiff but it bends along the bottom and

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.209 
stiff but it bends along the bottom and
what<00:02:03.939> this<00:02:04.179> does<00:02:04.479> it<00:02:05.109> goes<00:02:05.439> on<00:02:05.829> to<00:02:06.100> the

00:02:06.209 --> 00:02:06.219 
what this does it goes on to the

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:08.730 
what this does it goes on to the
junction<00:02:06.640> between<00:02:06.909> the<00:02:07.359> tomato<00:02:07.749> stem<00:02:08.319> and<00:02:08.530> the

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:08.740 
junction between the tomato stem and the

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:11.340 
junction between the tomato stem and the
tomato<00:02:09.069> truss<00:02:09.640> so<00:02:10.360> that<00:02:10.539> as<00:02:10.660> the<00:02:10.810> tomato<00:02:11.080> gets

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:11.350 
tomato truss so that as the tomato gets

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:13.770 
tomato truss so that as the tomato gets
heavier<00:02:11.740> it<00:02:12.010> can't<00:02:12.550> bend<00:02:13.000> more<00:02:13.300> than<00:02:13.480> that<00:02:13.630> it

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
heavier it can't bend more than that it

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:14.380 
heavier it can't bend more than that it
can't

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
can't

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:17.830 
can't
snap<00:02:14.900> off<00:02:15.220> now<00:02:16.220> it's<00:02:17.030> best<00:02:17.240> to<00:02:17.330> get<00:02:17.480> these<00:02:17.660> on

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
snap off now it's best to get these on

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.110 
snap off now it's best to get these on
early<00:02:18.200> so<00:02:18.680> I'll<00:02:19.010> show<00:02:19.280> you<00:02:19.310> just<00:02:19.490> how<00:02:19.670> to<00:02:19.760> pop

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
early so I'll show you just how to pop

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:25.030 
early so I'll show you just how to pop
them<00:02:20.330> on<00:02:20.450> they're<00:02:20.630> quite<00:02:20.870> simple<00:02:23.800> so<00:02:24.800> what

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
them on they're quite simple so what

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.010 
them on they're quite simple so what
we're<00:02:25.220> looking<00:02:25.250> for<00:02:25.730> is<00:02:25.970> a<00:02:26.240> trusted<00:02:26.810> about

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:27.020 
we're looking for is a trusted about

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:29.740 
we're looking for is a trusted about
this<00:02:27.230> age<00:02:27.440> this<00:02:27.770> is<00:02:28.150> probably<00:02:29.150> only<00:02:29.360> a<00:02:29.510> couple

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
this age this is probably only a couple

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:33.160 
this age this is probably only a couple
of<00:02:29.930> MIL<00:02:30.170> thick<00:02:31.070> and<00:02:31.580> it's<00:02:31.730> still<00:02:32.270> quite

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
of MIL thick and it's still quite

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:35.350 
of MIL thick and it's still quite
flexible<00:02:33.470> and<00:02:34.220> that's<00:02:34.400> important<00:02:35.060> if<00:02:35.240> you've

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
flexible and that's important if you've

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.840 
flexible and that's important if you've
tried<00:02:35.570> to<00:02:35.780> put<00:02:35.959> these<00:02:36.200> on<00:02:36.340> when<00:02:37.340> it<00:02:37.459> stopped

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:37.850 
tried to put these on when it stopped

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:41.979 
tried to put these on when it stopped
being<00:02:38.150> flexible<00:02:38.720> they'll<00:02:39.110> snap<00:02:39.850> so<00:02:40.850> it<00:02:41.780> goes

00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:41.989 
being flexible they'll snap so it goes

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:47.430 
being flexible they'll snap so it goes
right<00:02:42.020> next<00:02:42.590> to<00:02:43.510> the<00:02:44.510> stem<00:02:44.840> and<00:02:45.140> you<00:02:45.800> just<00:02:46.010> pop

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 
right next to the stem and you just pop

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.500 
right next to the stem and you just pop
that's<00:02:48.440> support<00:02:48.920> on<00:02:49.130> and<00:02:49.580> what<00:02:49.820> it's<00:02:50.090> doing<00:02:50.209> is

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 
that's support on and what it's doing is

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:53.590 
that's support on and what it's doing is
strengthening<00:02:50.930> this<00:02:51.860> Junction<00:02:52.519> here<00:02:52.790> this<00:02:53.420> is

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:53.600 
strengthening this Junction here this is

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.690 
strengthening this Junction here this is
where<00:02:53.810> they<00:02:53.989> snap<00:02:54.350> and<00:02:54.560> this<00:02:55.040> tiny<00:02:55.370> bit<00:02:55.610> of

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
where they snap and this tiny bit of

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.449 
where they snap and this tiny bit of
plastic<00:02:56.120> will<00:02:56.420> stop<00:02:56.690> all<00:02:56.989> of<00:02:57.230> that<00:02:57.410> so<00:02:58.310> that's

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459 
plastic will stop all of that so that's

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:00.759 
plastic will stop all of that so that's
all<00:02:58.910> there<00:02:59.239> is<00:02:59.360> to<00:02:59.600> get<00:02:59.750> a<00:02:59.780> natural<00:02:59.959> support<00:03:00.590> on

00:03:00.759 --> 00:03:00.769 
all there is to get a natural support on

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:02.320 
all there is to get a natural support on
and<00:03:00.950> as<00:03:01.040> you<00:03:01.100> can<00:03:01.250> see<00:03:01.310> we're<00:03:01.730> working<00:03:01.880> in<00:03:02.300> a

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:02.330 
and as you can see we're working in a

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:04.600 
and as you can see we're working in a
bit<00:03:02.510> of<00:03:02.600> a<00:03:02.690> greenhouse<00:03:03.560> sauna<00:03:04.040> at<00:03:04.220> the<00:03:04.310> moment

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:04.610 
bit of a greenhouse sauna at the moment

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:06.070 
bit of a greenhouse sauna at the moment
probably<00:03:04.820> not<00:03:05.150> the<00:03:05.239> best<00:03:05.269> time<00:03:05.600> there<00:03:05.780> to<00:03:05.989> be

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:06.080 
probably not the best time there to be

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.190 
probably not the best time there to be
working<00:03:06.730> remember<00:03:07.730> we<00:03:08.209> need<00:03:08.390> to<00:03:08.450> be<00:03:08.660> spraying

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
working remember we need to be spraying

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.470 
working remember we need to be spraying
our<00:03:09.769> tomatoes<00:03:10.370> at<00:03:10.580> the<00:03:10.700> moment<00:03:11.060> probably<00:03:11.239> with

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.480 
our tomatoes at the moment probably with

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:14.440 
our tomatoes at the moment probably with
milk<00:03:11.750> every<00:03:12.019> 21<00:03:12.440> days<00:03:12.650> with<00:03:13.190> very<00:03:13.459> very<00:03:14.150> weak

onto leaves and Bordeaux solution every
21<00:03:20.180> days<00:03:20.299> so<00:03:20.600> it's<00:03:20.720> every<00:03:20.989> 7<00:03:21.350> days<00:03:21.560> for<00:03:21.769> each

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:21.920 
21 days so it's every 7 days for each

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:23.949 
21 days so it's every 7 days for each
one<00:03:22.250> we've<00:03:22.670> got<00:03:22.910> to<00:03:23.030> keep<00:03:23.150> that<00:03:23.329> blight<00:03:23.600> at<00:03:23.780> bay
