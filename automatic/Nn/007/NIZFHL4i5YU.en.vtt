in my reppu kin let's start this shit up

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:29.810 
in my reppu kin let's start this shit up
alright<00:00:26.820> so<00:00:27.480> I<00:00:27.510> um<00:00:27.930> I<00:00:28.590> actually<00:00:29.340> tried<00:00:29.789> to

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
alright so I um I actually tried to

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.780 
alright so I um I actually tried to
record<00:00:30.539> this<00:00:30.750> before<00:00:31.289> but<00:00:31.949> the<00:00:32.250> commentary

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
record this before but the commentary

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.459 
record this before but the commentary
turned<00:00:33.059> out<00:00:33.239> horrible<00:00:33.750> so<00:00:33.960> I<00:00:33.989> decided<00:00:34.380> to

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
turned out horrible so I decided to

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.520 
turned out horrible so I decided to
rerecord<00:00:34.800> and<00:00:35.570> basically<00:00:36.570> all<00:00:36.870> you<00:00:37.230> missed

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
rerecord and basically all you missed

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.680 
rerecord and basically all you missed
was<00:00:37.800> me<00:00:38.190> finding<00:00:38.640> out<00:00:38.790> the<00:00:38.940> loophole<00:00:39.360> to<00:00:39.390> his

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
was me finding out the loophole to his

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.330 
was me finding out the loophole to his
artificial<00:00:40.110> intelligence<00:00:40.770> that<00:00:40.890> makes<00:00:41.160> him

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
artificial intelligence that makes him

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.610 
artificial intelligence that makes him
infinitely<00:00:41.670> easier<00:00:41.969> if<00:00:42.600> I<00:00:42.870> could<00:00:42.899> just<00:00:43.079> get

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
infinitely easier if I could just get

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:59.380 
infinitely easier if I could just get
them<00:00:43.770> locked<00:00:44.250> into<00:00:44.700> it<00:00:53.989> agora<00:00:54.989> oh<00:00:57.949> damn<00:00:58.949> it<00:00:59.100> ah

00:00:59.380 --> 00:00:59.390 
them locked into it agora oh damn it ah

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:01.580 
them locked into it agora oh damn it ah
see<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.539> trick<00:01:00.690> is<00:01:00.840> I<00:01:00.960> gotta<00:01:01.140> get<00:01:01.260> him<00:01:01.379> into<00:01:01.559> a

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
see the trick is I gotta get him into a

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.189 
see the trick is I gotta get him into a
corner<00:01:01.680> and<00:01:02.280> then<00:01:02.940> I<00:01:02.969> gotta<00:01:03.270> like<00:01:03.510> basically

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
corner and then I gotta like basically

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:09.590 
corner and then I gotta like basically
fuck<00:01:04.530> them<00:01:04.710> over<00:01:04.830> from<00:01:05.430> there<00:01:08.420> it's<00:01:09.420> not

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
fuck them over from there it's not

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.170 
fuck them over from there it's not
working<00:01:09.930> out<00:01:10.020> though<00:01:10.260> it's<00:01:10.830> gonna<00:01:11.640> be<00:01:11.850> a<00:01:11.880> luck

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
working out though it's gonna be a luck

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.010 
working out though it's gonna be a luck

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:08.290 
that loophole again all right this is
the<00:02:06.470> problem<00:02:06.740> with<00:02:06.890> like<00:02:07.160> command<00:02:07.790> reading<00:02:08.149> a

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:08.300 
the problem with like command reading a

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:19.020 
the problem with like command reading a
I<00:02:08.330> it<00:02:08.920> can<00:02:09.920> be<00:02:10.040> exploited<00:02:11.980> like<00:02:12.980> this<00:02:17.170> and

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
I it can be exploited like this and

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:24.910 
I it can be exploited like this and
there<00:02:20.030> you<00:02:20.150> go<00:02:20.180> i<00:02:20.360> beat<00:02:20.660> true<00:02:20.930> geese<00:02:22.330> and<00:02:23.920> I'm

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
there you go i beat true geese and I'm

round cuz you guys get the idea it's a
luck<00:02:29.480> based<00:02:29.720> mission<00:02:30.230> and<00:02:30.820> you<00:02:31.820> know<00:02:31.970> it's

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
luck based mission and you know it's

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:34.810 
luck based mission and you know it's
basically<00:02:33.260> just<00:02:33.380> be<00:02:33.680> exploiting<00:02:33.920> as<00:02:34.340> I<00:02:34.430> a<00:02:34.610> eyes

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:34.820 
basically just be exploiting as I a eyes
