00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:19.710
 hello good in this video what I 'm going to 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.830
 to show you is how do I do the different 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:26.910
 techniques that I know for different 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:29.550
 finished on the eyelashes as megan 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:32.220
 curl with very good thick and how I 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.350
 He extended them so nothing if you like 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:36.480
 done therefore every truth then I will 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.060
 begin by curling them as I curl myself 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.399
 eyelashes because first of all lame 

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:45.329
 a stick of those of those of the 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:47.879
 not ears and soaked it with tonic tonic 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.710
 Face time with this that 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.390
 I'm going to do is clean the eyelashes well 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.179
 to make sure that there is no 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:58.140
 waste look at a previous mask or 

00:00:54.179 --> 00:00:59.670
 anything that gives us dust that does not 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.739
 we have thrown in the face or whatever 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.309
 it's worth saying that I'm going to start 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.309
 zoom in 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:08.920
 and I'm going to start 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:12.250
 cleaning my date 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:18.110
 well, the tonic, what is going to be the 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.790
 what he is going to do is clean them and at the same time 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:22.369
 so soften the ones a little bit worth it for you 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:27.200
 we can work better and what I'm going to 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:31.190
 do now waiting for it to dry and I'm going 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:35.590
 to use to curl the I will use 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:35.590
 an eyelash curler and I'm going to use this 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.860
 in this way 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:49.130
 pretty conventional in the way that 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:52.100
 I do to pray the eyelashes is between 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:53.720
 times I'm going to start first 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.840
 nothing by entering all the tabs 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:59.109
 for it then 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:02.619
 and a little the eyelid and we approach what 

00:01:59.109 --> 00:02:06.090
 maximum possible to what is the root 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:10.459
 and here we press 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.459
 we wait 184 seconds 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:16.790
 and let's go now 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.420
 We hope we open a little bit and move forward 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:21.230
 a little in the hair and about half 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:24.260
 we come back 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:27.019
 to curl another three or four seconds 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:29.799
 and then already in what is the tip 

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:34.780
 then we slide a little bit and 

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:34.780
 press again three or four seconds 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.790
 and so 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:42.370
 they stay once curled 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:50.090
 Well now to extend them 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:51.330
 the best brush for this would be this 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:55.380
 here 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:57.610
 You see is elongated 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:00.160
 He has very thin legs 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:03.100
 flexible 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:05.290
 and with these cells you see what it does 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:11.150
 express and with this what he does is 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:15.210
 lengthen I'm not going to use is made 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:19.130
 this brush and what I'm going to use is 

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:19.130
 this white base 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:25.569
 to think then what I'm going to do 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:27.549
 is to put myself right on the end in the 

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:30.180
 ends of the eyelashes once 

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:30.180
 made up 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:46.500
 once we have so the tabs already 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:46.500
 then we comb a little 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:51.620
 we look a little to remove the 

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:51.620
 surplus 

00:03:54.710 --> 00:04:02.860
 and we wait for it to dry then once 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:02.860
 Dry'll take my mascara 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:06.659
 and I'm going to put it over 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:27.419
 well well done longer no longer 

00:04:24.759 --> 00:04:27.419
 I know if you appreciate it 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:41.280
 to step on them what I'm going to do is 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:43.350
 first use a base 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:46.010
 white 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:46.010
 now 

00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:53.029
 to swell them a little more 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:05:01.580
 and it creates an effect that there are more tabs 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:04.220
 so I'm going to put it on everything I'm going to 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:06.229
 influencing means and points 

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:09.790
 Well nothing once we have already put 

00:05:06.229 --> 00:05:12.160
 the test let's say 

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:14.440
 and on top of it, dry what I'm going to do 

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:18.000
 choose 

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:18.000
 a boat have me do 

00:05:18.449 --> 00:05:22.969
 I'm going to take a can of loose powder 

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:36.360
 with a little ball I'm going to put 

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:39.650
 in the eye of the hug 

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:39.650
 I'm going to put in the eye 

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:50.150
 and once I've dusted everything I hope that 

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:52.850
 yes I'm going to take a mask 

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:58.129
 eyelashes I always use maybelline's 

00:05:52.850 --> 00:06:00.800
 with mostly having the pp well 

00:05:58.129 --> 00:06:02.480
 what made is perfect to swell and 

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:05.430
 create a volume 

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:07.500
 I'm going to have classes 

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:09.780
 Well, I'm going to give you a little more 

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:11.670
 less of the most important steps to 

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:14.880
 perform them already xavi within time 

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:16.920
 middle roots and points and they already apply 

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:19.400
 Normally the lower tab better 

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:22.190
 Yes it is 

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:24.850
 the brush as I said that 

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:24.850
 it's like that 

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:31.880
 a little bit of base at the tip and to 

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:35.990
 I think what I have done is that 

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:39.080
 apart from being able to use fact we put 

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:41.419
 loose powders throughout 

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:44.629
 the tab and then then 

00:06:41.419 --> 00:06:47.509
 we already apply a mask a layer of 

00:06:44.629 --> 00:06:48.650
 eyelash mask good nothing else this 

00:06:47.509 --> 00:06:51.620
 video has been a bit weird the truth 

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:53.240
 because I 'm not totally willing but 

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:56.300
 well more or less you already know the effect and 

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:59.409
 I pass it like this so we'll see nothing in the 

00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:59.409
 next video see you later
