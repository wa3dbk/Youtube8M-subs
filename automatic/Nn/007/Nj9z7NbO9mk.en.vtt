so that you can press it and I thought

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:10.520 
so that you can press it and I thought
about<00:02:07.380> making<00:02:07.680> one<00:02:07.920> of<00:02:08.039> those<00:02:08.160> things<00:02:09.379> so<00:02:10.379> that

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
about making one of those things so that

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:11.630 
about making one of those things so that
we<00:02:10.649> could<00:02:10.800> press<00:02:10.979> our<00:02:11.160> side<00:02:11.370> of<00:02:11.520> the

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
we could press our side of the

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.030 
we could press our side of the
old-fashioned<00:02:12.330> way

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
old-fashioned way

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.030 
old-fashioned way
but<00:02:13.459> it<00:02:14.329> would<00:02:14.510> have<00:02:14.599> taken<00:02:14.750> me<00:02:15.140> probably<00:02:15.379> ten

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
but it would have taken me probably ten

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:21.399 
but it would have taken me probably ten
times<00:02:16.719> the<00:02:17.719> amount<00:02:18.379> of<00:02:18.709> work<00:02:18.980> and<00:02:20.319> maybe<00:02:21.319> a

00:02:21.399 --> 00:02:21.409 
times the amount of work and maybe a

00:02:21.409 --> 00:02:23.080

Apple Smasher and with the old used

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:29.860 
Apple Smasher and with the old used
washing<00:02:27.590> machine<00:02:27.969> it<00:02:28.969> does<00:02:29.329> everything<00:02:29.599> in

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
washing machine it does everything in

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:31.990 
washing machine it does everything in
one<00:02:29.989> step<00:02:30.319> it<00:02:30.530> grinds<00:02:31.250> up<00:02:31.370> the<00:02:31.489> apples<00:02:31.790> and

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
one step it grinds up the apples and

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.250 
one step it grinds up the apples and
presses<00:02:32.329> it<00:02:32.480> all<00:02:32.599> in<00:02:32.720> one<00:02:32.810> step

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
presses it all in one step

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.140 
presses it all in one step
so<00:02:33.439> once<00:02:33.769> the<00:02:34.040> apples<00:02:34.310> are<00:02:34.640> all<00:02:34.730> chopped<00:02:35.000> up

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
so once the apples are all chopped up

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:36.670 
so once the apples are all chopped up
and<00:02:35.269> the<00:02:35.390> best<00:02:35.569> at<00:02:35.780> spinning<00:02:36.049> getting<00:02:36.379> fast

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
and the best at spinning getting fast

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.220 
and the best at spinning getting fast
the<00:02:37.069> juice<00:02:37.340> will<00:02:37.790> come<00:02:38.060> out<00:02:38.239> and<00:02:38.450> get<00:02:38.750> pumps

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
the juice will come out and get pumps

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.270 
the juice will come out and get pumps
here<00:02:40.040> we<00:02:40.159> go

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
here we go

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:50.789 
here we go
power<00:02:45.459> spin<00:02:46.989> no<00:02:47.989> second<00:02:48.500> rinse<00:02:49.000> high<00:02:50.000> speed

and<00:02:51.799> now<00:02:51.980> we<00:02:52.069> just<00:02:52.159> have<00:02:52.340> to<00:02:52.459> wait<00:02:52.639> that<00:02:53.389> was

00:02:53.559 --> 00:02:53.569 
and now we just have to wait that was

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:56.069 
and now we just have to wait that was
hard

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:56.079 

00:02:56.079 --> 00:02:57.449

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370 
for the most part the apples just feed

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:06.339 
for the most part the apples just feed
down<00:03:04.609> as<00:03:05.120> fast<00:03:05.389> as<00:03:05.510> you<00:03:05.599> can<00:03:05.720> add<00:03:05.900> them<00:03:05.989> but<00:03:06.200> if

00:03:06.339 --> 00:03:06.349 
down as fast as you can add them but if

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:08.619 
down as fast as you can add them but if
you<00:03:06.409> get<00:03:06.650> a<00:03:06.680> hang-up<00:03:07.209> that's<00:03:08.209> what<00:03:08.329> this<00:03:08.419> is

00:03:08.619 --> 00:03:08.629 
you get a hang-up that's what this is

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:09.220 
you get a hang-up that's what this is
for

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.230 
for

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:11.770 
for
a<00:03:09.260> nice<00:03:09.709> plunger<00:03:10.310> with<00:03:10.549> the<00:03:10.760> stop<00:03:11.239> on<00:03:11.450> its<00:03:11.599> hood

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:11.780 
a nice plunger with the stop on its hood

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:13.449 
a nice plunger with the stop on its hood
you<00:03:11.930> can't<00:03:12.169> accidentally<00:03:12.739> stick<00:03:13.010> it<00:03:13.159> down<00:03:13.310> to

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:13.459 
you can't accidentally stick it down to

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:20.310 
you can't accidentally stick it down to
firing<00:03:13.730> Ryan's<00:03:14.389> a<00:03:14.450> heck<00:03:14.599> out

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:20.320 

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:22.300 

we<00:03:21.320> found<00:03:21.590> that<00:03:21.710> if<00:03:21.830> you<00:03:21.860> throw<00:03:22.100> them<00:03:22.160> down

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:22.310 
we found that if you throw them down

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:23.590 
we found that if you throw them down
with<00:03:22.430> a<00:03:22.460> little<00:03:22.610> chorus<00:03:23.060> you<00:03:23.240> don't<00:03:23.390> have<00:03:23.480> the

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:23.600 
with a little chorus you don't have the

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:30.330 
with a little chorus you don't have the
funds<00:03:23.840> in<00:03:24.020> these<00:03:24.110> much<00:03:26.470> make<00:03:27.470> sure<00:03:27.620> your<00:03:27.740> shot

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.340 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:32.380 

we<00:03:31.340> play<00:03:31.520> girls<00:03:31.760> have<00:03:31.910> to<00:03:32.000> get<00:03:32.060> the<00:03:32.150> timing

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:32.390 
we play girls have to get the timing

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:39.280 
we play girls have to get the timing
right<00:03:36.790> every<00:03:37.790> time<00:03:38.030> I<00:03:38.180> assume<00:03:38.480> in<00:03:38.630> on<00:03:38.750> it<00:03:38.930> stops

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:39.290 
right every time I assume in on it stops

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:45.210 
right every time I assume in on it stops
there<00:03:40.250> it<00:03:40.340> goes

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:45.220 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:47.590 

it<00:03:46.220> kind<00:03:46.430> of<00:03:46.490> becomes<00:03:46.670> again<00:03:46.970> you<00:03:47.120> keep<00:03:47.360> track

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:47.600 
it kind of becomes again you keep track

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:50.230 
it kind of becomes again you keep track
of<00:03:47.660> how<00:03:47.900> many<00:03:48.050> who<00:03:48.350> miss<00:03:48.590> how<00:03:49.520> many<00:03:49.730> get<00:03:50.030> in<00:03:50.120> the

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:50.240 
of how many who miss how many get in the

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:59.740 
of how many who miss how many get in the
hall<00:03:50.420> see<00:03:51.350> it<00:03:51.410> was<00:03:51.620> there<00:03:51.980> just<00:03:58.750> Sunday

00:03:59.740 --> 00:03:59.750

afternoon but this is so much fun that

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:09.789 
afternoon but this is so much fun that
we<00:04:02.840> don't<00:04:03.080> consider<00:04:03.410> it<00:04:03.560> work

00:04:09.789 --> 00:04:09.799 

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:15.979 

we<00:04:10.799> average<00:04:11.340> about<00:04:13.129> maybe<00:04:14.659> two<00:04:15.659> and<00:04:15.750> a<00:04:15.840> half

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:15.989 
we average about maybe two and a half

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:18.949 
we average about maybe two and a half
gallons<00:04:16.590> that<00:04:16.739> I<00:04:16.829> hear<00:04:17.070> per<00:04:17.400> bushel<00:04:17.959> which

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:18.959 
gallons that I hear per bushel which

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:21.590 
gallons that I hear per bushel which
isn't<00:04:19.169> too<00:04:19.470> bad<00:04:19.729> we<00:04:20.729> might<00:04:20.910> get<00:04:21.090> a<00:04:21.120> little<00:04:21.299> more

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:21.600 
isn't too bad we might get a little more

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:27.379 
isn't too bad we might get a little more
with<00:04:21.959> it<00:04:22.880> you<00:04:23.880> know<00:04:24.000> with<00:04:24.240> a<00:04:24.270> good<00:04:26.389> considering

00:04:27.379 --> 00:04:27.389 
with it you know with a good considering

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:28.969 
with it you know with a good considering
the<00:04:27.539> amount<00:04:27.720> of<00:04:27.900> work<00:04:28.139> involved<00:04:28.530> that's

00:04:28.969 --> 00:04:28.979 
the amount of work involved that's

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:47.550 
the amount of work involved that's
really<00:04:29.280> a<00:04:29.310> lot<00:04:29.520> more<00:04:31.100> for<00:04:32.100> us<00:04:32.220> anyway

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:55.430 
once the pump kicks in it'll be flowing

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:58.709 
once the pump kicks in it'll be flowing
here

00:04:58.709 --> 00:04:58.719

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:12.610 
look at that go in just turn the pump on

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:16.659 
look at that go in just turn the pump on
after<00:05:13.610> the<00:05:13.729> second<00:05:14.120> spin<00:05:14.419> cycle<00:05:15.610> okay<00:05:16.610> the

00:05:16.659 --> 00:05:16.669 
after the second spin cycle okay the

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:19.899 
after the second spin cycle okay the
results<00:05:17.060> are<00:05:17.659> in<00:05:17.930> after<00:05:18.529> a<00:05:18.560> second<00:05:19.129> spin<00:05:19.520> I

00:05:19.899 --> 00:05:19.909 
results are in after a second spin I

00:05:19.909 --> 00:05:24.429 
results are in after a second spin I
just<00:05:20.810> think<00:05:21.020> we<00:05:21.139> have<00:05:21.849> that<00:05:22.849> much<00:05:22.909> juice<00:05:23.449> from

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:42.770 
with most of the apples in the beginning

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:44.920 
with most of the apples in the beginning
get<00:05:43.009> chopped<00:05:43.250> really<00:05:43.580> fine<00:05:43.729> like<00:05:44.509> this<00:05:44.539> stuff

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:44.930 
get chopped really fine like this stuff

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:47.439 
get chopped really fine like this stuff
here<00:05:45.289> and<00:05:45.469> they<00:05:46.250> feel<00:05:46.430> real<00:05:46.669> dry<00:05:46.909> at<00:05:47.150> the<00:05:47.270> end

00:05:47.439 --> 00:05:47.449 
here and they feel real dry at the end

00:05:47.449 --> 00:05:49.990 
here and they feel real dry at the end
see<00:05:47.960> this<00:05:48.469> basket<00:05:48.979> really<00:05:49.099> floats<00:05:49.460> in<00:05:49.639> here<00:05:49.849> is

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:50.000 
see this basket really floats in here is

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.240 
see this basket really floats in here is
kind<00:05:50.180> of<00:05:50.270> like<00:05:50.419> an<00:05:50.569> anti<00:05:50.990> bounce<00:05:51.770> sort<00:05:52.129> of

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:52.250 
kind of like an anti bounce sort of

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:55.089 
kind of like an anti bounce sort of
thing<00:05:52.639> that<00:05:52.669> the<00:05:52.940> machine<00:05:53.330> has<00:05:53.539> and<00:05:53.870> as<00:05:54.800> it

00:05:55.089 --> 00:05:55.099 
thing that the machine has and as it

00:05:55.099 --> 00:05:56.829 
thing that the machine has and as it
gets<00:05:55.279> heavier<00:05:55.669> the<00:05:55.909> basket<00:05:56.389> sinks<00:05:56.719> a<00:05:56.810> little

00:05:56.829 --> 00:05:56.839 
gets heavier the basket sinks a little

00:05:56.839 --> 00:05:58.629 
gets heavier the basket sinks a little
bit<00:05:57.169> and<00:05:57.289> so<00:05:57.409> that<00:05:57.589> gap<00:05:57.860> between<00:05:58.129> the<00:05:58.430> teeth

00:05:58.629 --> 00:05:58.639 
bit and so that gap between the teeth

00:05:58.639 --> 00:06:01.360 
bit and so that gap between the teeth
and<00:05:58.879> the<00:05:59.089> the<00:05:59.360> feed<00:05:59.569> tube<00:05:59.779> increases<00:06:00.379> and<00:06:00.740> you

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:01.370 
and the the feed tube increases and you

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:03.719 
and the the feed tube increases and you
end<00:06:01.460> up<00:06:01.610> with<00:06:01.819> some<00:06:02.029> more<00:06:02.210> chunks<00:06:03.199> like<00:06:03.349> this

00:06:03.719 --> 00:06:03.729 
end up with some more chunks like this

00:06:03.729 --> 00:06:06.430 
end up with some more chunks like this
but<00:06:04.729> we<00:06:04.849> experimented<00:06:05.389> with<00:06:05.659> shipping<00:06:06.110> up<00:06:06.289> the

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:06.440 
but we experimented with shipping up the

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:08.050 
but we experimented with shipping up the
basket<00:06:06.889> and<00:06:07.009> found<00:06:07.219> that<00:06:07.370> it<00:06:07.520> just<00:06:07.669> bounced

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:08.060 
basket and found that it just bounced

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:09.640 
basket and found that it just bounced
around<00:06:08.240> way<00:06:08.599> too<00:06:08.659> much<00:06:08.960> and<00:06:09.229> we<00:06:09.319> didn't<00:06:09.560> get

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:09.650 
around way too much and we didn't get

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:12.640 
around way too much and we didn't get
that<00:06:09.830> much<00:06:10.099> more<00:06:10.370> yield<00:06:10.879> so<00:06:11.319> this<00:06:12.319> is<00:06:12.469> the<00:06:12.560> way

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:12.650 
that much more yield so this is the way

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:13.839 
that much more yield so this is the way
we<00:06:12.800> do<00:06:12.919> it<00:06:13.039> and<00:06:13.370> it<00:06:13.460> seems<00:06:13.490> to<00:06:13.699> work<00:06:13.759> pretty

00:06:13.839 --> 00:06:13.849 
we do it and it seems to work pretty

00:06:13.849 --> 00:06:22.150 
we do it and it seems to work pretty
good<00:06:18.550> don't<00:06:19.550> spill

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:22.160
