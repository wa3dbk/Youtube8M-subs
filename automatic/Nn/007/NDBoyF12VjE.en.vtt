00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:34.400
 We are free, let's always be it, let's always know 

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:41.680
 And before deny your lights, your lights, your lights the sun 

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:50.320
 That we miss the solemn vow, that the Fatherland to the Eternal raised. 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:01:05.280
 That we miss the solemn vow, which from the Fatherland to the Eternal raised.

 let's renew the grand oath 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:51.920
 That we surrender, that we surrender That we surrender to the God of Jacob 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:02:02.160
 That we surrender to the God of Jacob, to the God of Jacob ... 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:09.840
 We're free! let's always know, let's always know 

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:18.000
 And before deny your lights, your lights, your lights the sun 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:26.080
 That we miss the solemn vow That the Fatherland to the Eternal raised. 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:34.000
 That we miss the solemn vow That from the Fatherland to the Eternal raised. 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:41.360
 That we miss the solemn vow That from the Fatherland to the Eternal raised. 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.800
 Long live Peru!
