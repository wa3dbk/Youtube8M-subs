00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.270
 I have in my wardrobe a little special clothing 

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:07.090
 a garment that is particularly important to me 

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:10.090
 but with whom I have a relationship 

00:00:10.699 --> 00:00:14.109
 it is a polo lacoste white griffey of the famous crocodile 

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:16.579
 polo lacoste 

00:00:16.579 --> 00:00:18.900
 I'm not going to buy but my dad 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.900
 it was in 1965 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.659
 then a simple mechanic 

00:00:24.659 --> 00:00:28.480
 he offered himself this garment can criticize far-fetched for him who 

00:00:28.479 --> 00:00:31.489
 accounted for 30% of his salary 

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:34.970
 it should be noted that in his small farming town of Nemours 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:38.070
 polo lacoste did not meet on every street corner 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:42.570
 Besides, I know my father's colleagues, but we can 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:43.880
 fail to realize it 

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:46.450
 seeing him wearing the famous polo shirt 

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:48.620
 his argument in the face of criticism 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:52.860
 it is an investment in quality and will be a winner in the end you will see 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.600
 and it's true that he was not denied 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.680
 for more than 44 years later the polo has kept all its superb 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:03.900
 I see especially the symbol tfi so 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:06.900
 a desire for social climbing at my father's 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:10.040
 sect wearing a lacoste shirt 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:11.960
 it turns you into a month 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.030
 it gives you the feeling of belonging to what leaves a little side 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.670
 to those we envy when we look roland-garros that to the 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:22.820
 television because they are the other place of choice on the stands 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:25.350
 everything started there 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.380
 in 1927 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.200
 the captain of the french cup team davis himself 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.960
 promise the champions of rené lacoste a crocodile suitcase if it 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.270
 won an important match 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:38.580
 lacoste father 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:40.310
 but the winners oversupply 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:44.740
 the crocodile that one he has the reputation of never letting go of his 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:45.750
 prey 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.799
 the champion hastens to embroider the animal on his blazer 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.670
 and armoric wanderings on the tennis courts 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:55.170
 when it sounds the time of reconversion 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.500
 in 1933 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.510
 rené lacoste obviously bet on his crocodile to launch a whole 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:03.510
 new shirt in light store 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.260
 would be more fair 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:11.420
 especially as the shape is inspired by the short-sleeved garment worn 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.559
 English paulo players 

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:17.109
 the idea of ​​the crocodile on the shirt and not go unnoticed 

00:02:17.659 --> 00:02:20.589
 it is neither more nor less than the invention of a new medium 

00:02:20.589 --> 00:02:23.149
 advertiser 

00:02:23.149 --> 00:02:25.729
 success is at the rendezvous 

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:28.509
 lacoste is exported all over the world 

00:02:28.509 --> 00:02:30.419
 and go to color 

00:02:30.419 --> 00:02:34.929
 good in the meantime the polo has become too fair for my father 

00:02:34.929 --> 00:02:38.349
 and one fine day he offered me ceremony bones 

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:42.079
 it was in the 80s I was 14 years old 

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:46.769
 at that time polo lacoste was certainly already a lot 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:47.929
 democratized 

00:02:47.929 --> 00:02:51.139
 but the symbolic value respecting the pact 

00:02:51.139 --> 00:02:55.439
 thanks to him I tactfully identified with my father 

00:02:55.439 --> 00:02:58.699
 and I secretly hoped to profit from the success 

00:02:58.699 --> 00:03:01.019
 so this treatment to test 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:03.079
 8 I grew up 

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:04.230
 but one day 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:08.129
 political convictions conflicted with the state of mind of the country 

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:11.129
 it's still way too close I did not have a choice 

00:03:11.749 --> 00:03:14.059
 I put the polo in quarantine 

00:03:14.059 --> 00:03:15.329
 very short term 

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:18.489
 certainly but for the sake of coherence 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:23.069
 it took me not to wait until the 90s that the suburbs become embroiled in 

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:27.480
 lacoste mark they are trying to appropriate the crocodile for me to dare 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.769
 not again take on this family monument 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:34.969
 but it did not please him why city this misappropriation of these values 

00:03:35.749 --> 00:03:40.099
 he has dried his tears he now resists all his accounts 

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:43.629
 unruffled the gaze inexorably turned
