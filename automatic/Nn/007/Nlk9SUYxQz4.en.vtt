millimeter<00:00:42.580> basically<00:00:43.580> in<00:00:43.640> this<00:00:43.729> video<00:00:43.909> I'm

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:44.089 
millimeter basically in this video I'm

00:00:44.089 --> 00:00:46.270 
millimeter basically in this video I'm
gonna<00:00:44.210> talk<00:00:44.479> with<00:00:44.930> conclusions<00:00:45.620> as<00:00:45.920> to<00:00:45.979> which

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:46.280 
gonna talk with conclusions as to which

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.250 
gonna talk with conclusions as to which
lens<00:00:46.549> you<00:00:46.940> should<00:00:47.180> get<00:00:47.390> first<00:00:47.750> of<00:00:47.900> all<00:00:48.019> I'm

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:48.260 
lens you should get first of all I'm

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.170 
lens you should get first of all I'm
just<00:00:48.440> gonna<00:00:48.559> go<00:00:48.799> over<00:00:48.920> the<00:00:49.400> quick<00:00:49.610> differences

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:50.180 
just gonna go over the quick differences

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:53.829 
just gonna go over the quick differences
between<00:00:50.360> the<00:00:50.659> lenses<00:00:51.820> first<00:00:52.820> is<00:00:53.059> the<00:00:53.390> good<00:00:53.600> for

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:53.839 
between the lenses first is the good for

00:00:53.839 --> 00:00:58.000 
between the lenses first is the good for
the<00:00:54.170> 14<00:00:54.830> 24<00:00:55.400> millimeter<00:00:56.350> firstly<00:00:57.350> it's<00:00:57.739> got<00:00:57.979> a

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.010 
the 14 24 millimeter firstly it's got a

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:01.420 
the 14 24 millimeter firstly it's got a
much<00:00:58.280> larger<00:00:58.729> f-stop<00:00:59.210> f-stop<00:01:00.019> 2.8<00:01:00.830> throughout

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:01.430 
much larger f-stop f-stop 2.8 throughout

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:03.609 
much larger f-stop f-stop 2.8 throughout
the<00:01:01.610> entire<00:01:01.940> zoom<00:01:02.360> Ridge<00:01:02.659> which<00:01:03.199> means<00:01:03.440> that

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:03.619 
the entire zoom Ridge which means that

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:05.140 
the entire zoom Ridge which means that
this<00:01:03.710> is<00:01:03.769> really<00:01:04.190> good<00:01:04.400> for<00:01:04.790> low-light

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:05.150 
this is really good for low-light

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:07.510 
this is really good for low-light
photography<00:01:05.590> it's<00:01:06.590> got<00:01:06.830> an<00:01:06.920> excellent

places like that it's also quite a bit
sharper<00:01:22.640> than<00:01:22.759> the<00:01:22.880> 10<00:01:23.090> to<00:01:23.210> 24<00:01:23.689> millimeter<00:01:24.259> in

sharper than the 10 to 24 millimeter in
general<00:01:25.039> this<00:01:25.520> is<00:01:25.729> one<00:01:25.909> of<00:01:25.939> these<00:01:26.149> sharpest

00:01:26.709 --> 00:01:26.719 
general this is one of these sharpest

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:29.740 
general this is one of these sharpest

sharpness<00:02:28.040> really<00:02:28.640> improves<00:02:29.060> on<00:02:29.269> that<00:02:29.450> lens<00:02:29.659> I

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
sharpness really improves on that lens I

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:31.629 
sharpness really improves on that lens I
think<00:02:29.930> it's<00:02:30.049> pretty<00:02:30.319> close<00:02:30.590> to<00:02:30.650> that<00:02:31.040> of<00:02:31.280> the

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:31.639 
think it's pretty close to that of the

00:02:31.639 --> 00:02:34.360 
think it's pretty close to that of the

those it can take 77 millimeter filters

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:24.399 
those it can take 77 millimeter filters
which<00:03:22.609> is<00:03:22.819> great<00:03:23.150> it's<00:03:23.659> a<00:03:23.810> lot<00:03:24.049> lighter

00:03:24.399 --> 00:03:24.409 
which is great it's a lot lighter

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:26.949 
which is great it's a lot lighter
probably<00:03:25.190> more<00:03:25.400> around<00:03:25.639> one<00:03:25.909> pound<00:03:26.150> so<00:03:26.659> about

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:26.959 
probably more around one pound so about

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:29.110 
probably more around one pound so about
half<00:03:27.260> the<00:03:27.530> weight<00:03:27.709> of<00:03:27.949> this<00:03:28.099> lens<00:03:28.400> here<00:03:28.699> it's

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.120 
half the weight of this lens here it's

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.830 
half the weight of this lens here it's
also<00:03:29.359> about<00:03:29.720> half<00:03:30.019> the<00:03:30.290> price<00:03:30.650> so<00:03:31.629> those<00:03:32.629> who

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:32.840 
also about half the price so those who

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:35.140 
also about half the price so those who
you<00:03:33.049> want<00:03:33.260> to<00:03:33.319> budget<00:03:33.560> the<00:03:34.010> Nikon<00:03:34.400> 10<00:03:34.639> to<00:03:34.729> 24

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.150 
you want to budget the Nikon 10 to 24

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:38.939 
you want to budget the Nikon 10 to 24
millimeter<00:03:35.689> is<00:03:36.459> definitely<00:03:37.459> a<00:03:37.669> lot<00:03:38.180> cheaper

00:03:38.939 --> 00:03:38.949 
millimeter is definitely a lot cheaper

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:41.349 
millimeter is definitely a lot cheaper
but<00:03:39.949> of<00:03:40.069> course<00:03:40.340> here's<00:03:40.819> where<00:03:41.060> the<00:03:41.150> trick

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:41.359 
but of course here's where the trick

00:03:41.359 --> 00:03:42.999 
but of course here's where the trick
comes<00:03:41.389> in<00:03:41.780> both<00:03:42.019> of<00:03:42.199> them<00:03:42.409> are<00:03:42.500> very<00:03:42.680> different

00:03:42.999 --> 00:03:43.009 
comes in both of them are very different

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:45.520 
comes in both of them are very different
