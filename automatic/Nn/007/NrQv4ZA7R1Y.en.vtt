with<00:02:14.440> some<00:02:15.160> experts<00:02:15.670> in<00:02:15.820> different<00:02:16.030> area<00:02:16.600> to

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
with some experts in different area to

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.410 
with some experts in different area to
make<00:02:17.020> sure<00:02:17.200> that<00:02:17.500> our<00:02:18.070> project<00:02:18.580> was<00:02:18.760> the<00:02:18.790> on

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
make sure that our project was the on

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:22.670 
make sure that our project was the on
track<00:02:19.690> and<00:02:20.020> on<00:02:20.140> budget<00:02:20.380> out<00:02:21.250> all<00:02:21.880> the<00:02:22.030> time

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
track and on budget out all the time

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.430 
track and on budget out all the time
there<00:02:23.680> were<00:02:23.800> two<00:02:24.100> major<00:02:24.400> fears<00:02:25.240> that<00:02:26.140> we<00:02:26.290> have

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440 
there were two major fears that we have

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.820 
there were two major fears that we have
to<00:02:26.560> deal<00:02:26.710> with<00:02:27.420> our<00:02:28.420> robotic<00:02:29.020> project<00:02:29.470> the

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
to deal with our robotic project the

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:32.040 
to deal with our robotic project the
first<00:02:30.010> one<00:02:30.280> was<00:02:30.520> the<00:02:30.670> monetary<00:02:31.090> aspect<00:02:31.360> for

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.050 
first one was the monetary aspect for

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:34.650 
first one was the monetary aspect for
sure<00:02:32.260> there<00:02:32.560> was<00:02:32.680> a<00:02:32.710> fear<00:02:33.100> that<00:02:33.210> the<00:02:34.210> project

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
sure there was a fear that the project

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:37.680 
sure there was a fear that the project
can<00:02:34.900> could<00:02:35.560> easily<00:02:35.800> bump<00:02:36.250> the<00:02:36.640> initial<00:02:37.090> budget

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
can could easily bump the initial budget

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:42.180 
can could easily bump the initial budget
that<00:02:38.050> we<00:02:39.060> we<00:02:40.060> have<00:02:40.180> set<00:02:40.480> but<00:02:41.380> with<00:02:41.560> a<00:02:42.010> good

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190 
that we we have set but with a good

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:44.640 
that we we have set but with a good
planning<00:02:42.700> and<00:02:42.880> with<00:02:43.209> a<00:02:43.239> good<00:02:43.570> follow<00:02:43.840> on<00:02:44.170> the

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
planning and with a good follow on the

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:46.410 
planning and with a good follow on the
project<00:02:45.070> and<00:02:45.220> with<00:02:45.400> the<00:02:45.430> help<00:02:45.700> of<00:02:45.910> an<00:02:46.090> expert

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
project and with the help of an expert

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:49.560 
project and with the help of an expert
that<00:02:46.450> we<00:02:46.870> we<00:02:47.200> partner<00:02:47.620> with<00:02:48.060> the<00:02:49.060> project<00:02:49.420> was

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:49.570 
that we we partner with the project was

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:50.340 
that we we partner with the project was
a<00:02:49.600> real<00:02:49.840> success

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:50.350 
a real success

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:52.410 
a real success
the<00:02:51.100> second<00:02:51.430> fear<00:02:51.670> that<00:02:51.910> we<00:02:52.030> have<00:02:52.180> to<00:02:52.300> deal

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
the second fear that we have to deal

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:55.140 
the second fear that we have to deal
with<00:02:52.630> is<00:02:52.840> the<00:02:53.230> HR<00:02:53.739> aspect<00:02:54.190> for<00:02:54.580> sure<00:02:54.790> at<00:02:55.030> the

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
with is the HR aspect for sure at the

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.300 
with is the HR aspect for sure at the
beginning<00:02:55.300> employees<00:02:56.020> were<00:02:56.320> really<00:02:57.070> afraid

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
beginning employees were really afraid

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:00.540 
beginning employees were really afraid
of<00:02:57.700> losing<00:02:58.060> their<00:02:58.209> job<00:02:58.530> with<00:02:59.530> the<00:03:00.130> arrival<00:03:00.280> of

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:00.550 
of losing their job with the arrival of

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:03.930 
of losing their job with the arrival of
the<00:03:00.760> robotic<00:03:01.390> cell<00:03:01.630> but<00:03:02.560> we<00:03:03.550> make<00:03:03.760> them

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940 
the robotic cell but we make them

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:06.449 
the robotic cell but we make them
understand<00:03:04.570> that<00:03:04.720> we<00:03:05.290> will<00:03:05.470> use<00:03:05.709> them<00:03:05.950> instead

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:06.459 
understand that we will use them instead

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:09.180 
understand that we will use them instead
of<00:03:06.640> jobs<00:03:07.600> that<00:03:07.870> need<00:03:08.050> more<00:03:08.320> skills<00:03:08.739> or<00:03:08.950> more

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:09.190 
of jobs that need more skills or more

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:11.910 
of jobs that need more skills or more
technical<00:03:09.670> aspect<00:03:10.150> and<00:03:10.360> the<00:03:10.959> robotic<00:03:11.500> will<00:03:11.709> do

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 
technical aspect and the robotic will do

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.330 
technical aspect and the robotic will do
the<00:03:12.100> the<00:03:12.670> easy<00:03:12.910> job<00:03:13.269> or<00:03:13.480> the<00:03:13.600> repeat<00:03:13.930> job<00:03:14.340> the

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.340 
the the easy job or the repeat job the

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:17.850 
the the easy job or the repeat job the
main<00:03:15.489> impact<00:03:15.910> of<00:03:16.090> the<00:03:16.209> robotic<00:03:16.810> project<00:03:17.620> was

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:17.860 
main impact of the robotic project was

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:20.009 
main impact of the robotic project was
the<00:03:17.890> productivity<00:03:18.790> rate<00:03:19.000> that<00:03:19.390> we<00:03:19.570> increased

00:03:20.009 --> 00:03:20.019 
the productivity rate that we increased

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:23.670 
the productivity rate that we increased
by<00:03:20.200> 400%<00:03:20.830> and<00:03:21.790> by<00:03:22.540> the<00:03:22.600> way<00:03:22.810> we<00:03:22.959> reduce<00:03:23.290> also

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680 
by 400% and by the way we reduce also

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.490 
by 400% and by the way we reduce also
the<00:03:23.860> cost<00:03:24.100> of<00:03:24.250> the<00:03:24.430> the<00:03:24.850> part<00:03:25.120> and<00:03:25.570> they<00:03:26.440> were

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 
the cost of the the part and they were

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.500 
the cost of the the part and they were
also<00:03:26.769> 12-person<00:03:27.730> in<00:03:27.850> the<00:03:27.940> beginning<00:03:28.300> working

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
also 12-person in the beginning working

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:30.630 
also 12-person in the beginning working
into<00:03:28.930> the<00:03:28.959> cell<00:03:29.290> that<00:03:29.470> was<00:03:29.739> there<00:03:30.160> that<00:03:30.340> were

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:30.640 
into the cell that was there that were

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:33.270 
into the cell that was there that were
replaced<00:03:31.150> by<00:03:31.330> the<00:03:31.540> the<00:03:32.110> robot<00:03:32.470> that<00:03:33.070> we've

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 
replaced by the the robot that we've

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.580 
replaced by the the robot that we've
been<00:03:33.430> able<00:03:33.610> to<00:03:33.760> move<00:03:34.120> two<00:03:34.510> jobs<00:03:34.930> that<00:03:35.140> required

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.590 
been able to move two jobs that required

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:38.070 
been able to move two jobs that required
more<00:03:35.950> Skills<00:03:36.370> or<00:03:36.550> more<00:03:36.850> expertise

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:38.080 
more Skills or more expertise

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:39.780 
more Skills or more expertise
and<00:03:38.170> as<00:03:38.410> you<00:03:38.560> know<00:03:38.680> it's<00:03:38.860> really<00:03:39.160> difficult<00:03:39.670> in

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:39.790 
and as you know it's really difficult in

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:42.270 
and as you know it's really difficult in
this<00:03:39.970> time<00:03:40.300> to<00:03:40.540> have<00:03:40.690> a<00:03:40.720> good<00:03:40.960> personal<00:03:41.740> so

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:42.280 
this time to have a good personal so

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:44.220 
this time to have a good personal so
it's<00:03:42.460> been<00:03:42.610> a<00:03:42.640> really<00:03:43.090> good<00:03:43.360> it's<00:03:43.870> been<00:03:44.050> really

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:44.230 
it's been a really good it's been really

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:46.110 
it's been a really good it's been really
good<00:03:44.410> for<00:03:44.620> us<00:03:44.680> to<00:03:45.010> being<00:03:45.400> able<00:03:45.520> to<00:03:45.640> move<00:03:45.910> this

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120 
good for us to being able to move this

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.300 
good for us to being able to move this
person<00:03:46.570> instead<00:03:46.960> of<00:03:47.020> trying<00:03:47.470> to<00:03:47.560> find<00:03:48.100> new

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.310 
person instead of trying to find new

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:51.150 
person instead of trying to find new
personal<00:03:49.320> there<00:03:50.320> are<00:03:50.380> four<00:03:50.620> step<00:03:50.920> that<00:03:51.100> I

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:51.160 
personal there are four step that I

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.940 
personal there are four step that I
recommend<00:03:52.090> for<00:03:52.360> a<00:03:52.420> robotic<00:03:52.930> project<00:03:53.500> the

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:53.950 
recommend for a robotic project the

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:56.100 
recommend for a robotic project the
first<00:03:54.220> one<00:03:54.460> is<00:03:54.700> really<00:03:55.060> to<00:03:55.330> have<00:03:55.450> a<00:03:55.540> good<00:03:55.810> press

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:56.110 
first one is really to have a good press

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:00.270 
first one is really to have a good press
duty<00:03:56.470> of<00:03:57.280> each<00:03:57.780> family<00:03:58.780> of<00:03:59.080> parts<00:03:59.500> to<00:04:00.100> make

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:00.280 
duty of each family of parts to make

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.340 
duty of each family of parts to make
sure<00:04:00.430> that<00:04:00.700> they<00:04:00.940> could<00:04:01.210> be<00:04:01.450> and<00:04:01.720> it<00:04:01.930> will<00:04:02.050> be

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:02.350 
sure that they could be and it will be

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:06.450 
sure that they could be and it will be
easily<00:04:02.620> be<00:04:03.160> robotized<00:04:04.380> the<00:04:05.380> second<00:04:05.710> phase<00:04:06.220> or

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:06.460 
easily be robotized the second phase or

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:08.280 
easily be robotized the second phase or
step<00:04:06.850> is<00:04:07.030> to<00:04:07.300> really<00:04:07.510> to<00:04:07.690> choose<00:04:07.930> a<00:04:07.960> good

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:08.290 
step is to really to choose a good

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:11.580 
step is to really to choose a good
partner<00:04:09.220> for<00:04:09.490> the<00:04:10.090> the<00:04:10.480> implementation<00:04:11.380> of

stay on track and the final step but one
of<00:04:25.990> the<00:04:26.290> the<00:04:26.620> most<00:04:26.830> important<00:04:27.400> one<00:04:27.640> is<00:04:28.030> to<00:04:28.300> have

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:28.360 
of the the most important one is to have

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:30.240 
of the the most important one is to have
a<00:04:28.450> good<00:04:28.600> communication<00:04:28.840> with<00:04:29.500> the<00:04:29.920> employee
