00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
and it's about to run out you're going

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.670 
and it's about to run out you're going
to<00:00:38.700> use<00:00:38.879> your<00:00:39.000> hover<00:00:39.270> to<00:00:39.809> let<00:00:40.079> it<00:00:40.200> recharge

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
to use your hover to let it recharge

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.090 
to use your hover to let it recharge
itself<00:00:41.190> so<00:00:42.320> this<00:00:43.320> is<00:00:43.350> this<00:00:43.559> may<00:00:43.739> sound<00:00:43.920> a

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
itself so this is this may sound a

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.319 
itself so this is this may sound a
little<00:00:44.129> bit<00:00:44.430> confusing<00:00:44.789> but<00:00:44.969> hang<00:00:45.149> in<00:00:45.300> there

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
little bit confusing but hang in there

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.690 
little bit confusing but hang in there
you<00:00:45.570> want<00:00:45.809> to<00:00:45.870> keep<00:00:46.079> shooting<00:00:46.649> your<00:00:47.100> grapple

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
you want to keep shooting your grapple

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.619 
you want to keep shooting your grapple
and<00:00:47.960> keep<00:00:48.960> going<00:00:49.350> to<00:00:49.469> the<00:00:49.590> top<00:00:49.890> of<00:00:50.100> the<00:00:50.219> star

00:00:50.619 --> 00:00:50.629 
and keep going to the top of the star

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:54.470 
and keep going to the top of the star
and<00:00:51.629> once<00:00:52.440> you<00:00:52.590> get<00:00:52.920> about<00:00:53.190> here<00:00:53.670> you're<00:00:54.329> good

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
and once you get about here you're good

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.110 
and once you get about here you're good
actually<00:00:54.629> going<00:00:54.870> to<00:00:54.960> be<00:00:54.989> able<00:00:55.320> to<00:00:55.610> jump<00:00:56.610> up<00:00:56.789> and

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
really far away from the map so you can

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.090 
really far away from the map so you can
only<00:01:44.820> stay<00:01:45.149> on<00:01:45.390> the<00:01:45.570> the<00:01:46.049> absolute<00:01:46.560> outskirts

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.340 
only stay on the the absolute outskirts
of<00:01:47.220> the<00:01:47.310> map<00:01:47.490> but<00:01:48.149> you<00:01:48.570> can<00:01:48.720> pretty<00:01:48.899> much<00:01:48.990> run

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
of the map but you can pretty much run

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.910 
of the map but you can pretty much run
around<00:01:49.649> the<00:01:49.770> entire<00:01:50.310> thing<00:01:50.509> so<00:01:51.530> you<00:01:52.530> guys<00:01:52.680> can

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
around the entire thing so you guys can

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.399 
around the entire thing so you guys can
