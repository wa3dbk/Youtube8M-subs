called<00:01:12.210> superior<00:01:12.840> probably<00:01:13.380> going<00:01:13.619> to<00:01:13.680> grow

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
called superior probably going to grow

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.410 
called superior probably going to grow
anymore<00:01:14.100> because<00:01:14.369> this<00:01:14.520> is<00:01:14.610> a<00:01:14.670> second<00:01:15.090> year<00:01:15.390> in

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
anymore because this is a second year in

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.060 
anymore because this is a second year in
a<00:01:15.750> row<00:01:15.780> that<00:01:16.340> didn't<00:01:17.340> get<00:01:17.460> a<00:01:17.490> high<00:01:17.700> yield<00:01:18.030> on<00:01:18.299> it

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:19.070 
a row that didn't get a high yield on it

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:21.200 
a row that didn't get a high yield on it
on<00:01:20.070> the<00:01:20.159> other<00:01:20.250> hand<00:01:20.340> the<00:01:20.580> Russians<00:01:21.030> did

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
on the other hand the Russians did

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.200 
on the other hand the Russians did
really<00:01:21.450> good<00:01:21.979> and<00:01:22.979> I<00:01:23.280> put<00:01:23.549> probably<00:01:23.759> about<00:01:24.030> the

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
really good and I put probably about the

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.990 
really good and I put probably about the
same<00:01:24.360> amount<00:01:24.420> of<00:01:24.810> plants<00:01:25.759> potatoes<00:01:26.759> in<00:01:26.909> the

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
same amount of plants potatoes in the

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.580 
same amount of plants potatoes in the
ground<00:01:27.299> so<00:01:27.689> you<00:01:28.430> can<00:01:29.430> see<00:01:29.700> that<00:01:30.170> the<00:01:31.170> russet

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
ground so you can see that the russet

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.600 
ground so you can see that the russet
did<00:01:32.280> really<00:01:32.610> well<00:01:33.650> and<00:01:34.650> rust<00:01:35.070> is<00:01:35.220> probably<00:01:35.490> one

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
did really well and rust is probably one

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.050 
did really well and rust is probably one
of<00:01:35.640> my<00:01:35.759> favorite<00:01:36.320> not<00:01:37.320> like<00:01:37.560> a<00:01:37.590> baked<00:01:37.890> potato

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060 
of my favorite not like a baked potato

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:42.319 
of my favorite not like a baked potato
potato<00:01:39.060> skins<00:01:40.400> so<00:01:41.400> that<00:01:41.610> was<00:01:41.790> good<00:01:42.000> so<00:01:42.240> I'm

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
potato skins so that was good so I'm

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.120 
potato skins so that was good so I'm
actually<00:01:42.450> am<00:01:42.750> probably<00:01:43.049> going<00:01:43.350> to<00:01:43.439> grow<00:01:43.680> I

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
actually am probably going to grow I

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.929 
actually am probably going to grow I
probably<00:01:44.430> won't<00:01:44.670> grow<00:01:44.970> the<00:01:45.659> superior<00:01:46.259> variety

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:46.939 
probably won't grow the superior variety

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:49.969 
probably won't grow the superior variety
the<00:01:47.939> Pontiacs<00:01:48.540> did<00:01:48.750> I<00:01:48.869> right<00:01:49.110> and<00:01:49.380> that<00:01:49.530> onyx

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:19.860 
that we had from the year before about a
month<00:02:16.840> ago<00:02:16.990> so<00:02:17.470> I<00:02:18.240> think<00:02:19.240> I'll<00:02:19.540> be<00:02:19.690> all<00:02:19.720> right

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870
