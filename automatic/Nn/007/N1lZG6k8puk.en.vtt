00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:10.000
 well-found friends of tuttoandroid.net 

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:11.950
 after a few weeks of waiting from 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.320
 our preview and also from the launch 

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:18.460
 occurred towards the end of May of lg 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:21.009
 c3 is that there with the device in hand 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:23.169
 today unboxing then in the coming days 

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:25.240
 once thoroughly tested 

00:00:23.169 --> 00:00:26.439
 obviously video review we start 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:29.320
 where by seeing what we feel 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:33.039
 inside the box in the foreground 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:35.320
 obviously the lg smartphone between which 

00:00:33.039 --> 00:00:38.920
 put a second aside without battery 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:43.570
 it seems to me an artistic hand on the part 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:48.940
 lower than the usual co.abi two in headphones 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:55.629
 here charger i guess at 2 amps usb 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:59.469
 I confirm it okay 1.8 ampere usb cable 

00:00:55.629 --> 00:01:01.899
 micro usb and then finally as I assumed the 

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:03.609
 battery latere that I'm going to beat ad 

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:07.869
 insert into the smartphone 

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:10.689
 because lg of 3a the removable cover 

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:15.630
 we can remove from this small hole 

00:01:10.689 --> 00:01:19.930
 let's see if we can do it without too much effort 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:24.579
 ok according to whether i take it off camera 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:27.820
 so I do better if not here on 

00:01:24.579 --> 00:01:30.579
 vivo with removable plastic cover 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:33.250
 with very beautiful aluminum effect 

00:01:30.579 --> 00:01:35.890
 light battery I'm going to insert it from 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:39.159
 3,000 miles for the micro slots 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:41.799
 sim and for the micro sd on the part 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:44.409
 lower and one-watt speaker 

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:46.780
 we have the three keys above for here 

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:48.880
 indicate with omitted power and volume down 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:52.000
 and then here on the left the laser 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.450
 infrared to focus better 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.850
 photo 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:57.310
 and then the LED flash on the part 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:59.560
 right I go to reassemble the cover that 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:01.750
 remember being in the plastic context 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:04.810
 aluminum effect that you can see from 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:07.810
 video also remove the plastic here on the 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:09.610
 front and start it we don't have that key 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:13.150
 power that I told you is positioned on 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:15.340
 back like on the g2 in the meantime 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:19.380
 I remove a bit of junk from the 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.380
 table ok 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:25.150
 we are waiting for the bio and meanwhile you buy yourself 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:28.030
 those technical features 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:31.930
 physical are 146 mm high 74 of 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:33.910
 width x 8 mm thick thickness 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:35.349
 on the most obviously part of spending that 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:39.040
 the central one because the cover is 

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:42.489
 rounded as you can see processor 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:44.140
 snapdragon 801 I forgot the weight 149 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:45.970
 grams available black processing 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:48.549
 white and gold 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:52.060
 we have a qhd display then four 

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:56.049
 times of 2160 high pixels per thousand 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:58.870
 part 40 wide therefore always one 

00:02:56.049 --> 00:03:01.569
 a really really nice display says 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:04.120
 volos attract from 2.3 gigahertz quads 

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:07.600
 core 5 thousand pixels the camera on 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:09.609
 front and 13 thousand pixels with double flash 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:11.600
 led see different gradation of 

00:03:09.609 --> 00:03:12.860
 temperature the 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:17.630
 to accompany the camera 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:20.330
 recordings up to 4k at 30 fps 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:24.500
 we turn on we access the software 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:27.410
 Italian so you also detail the 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:31.820
 amount of memory that is different 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:32.930
 based on the model of the year if 

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:36.340
 we can do this configuration 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:36.340
 on the fly 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:43.300
 expect a few seconds of course 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:46.400
 we have the whole cancer suite with 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:50.060
 various applications to use al 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:52.880
 better this lg g3 on the general part 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:56.570
 in on the phone indeed it was always 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:58.400
 active android 4.4.2 I was now looking for the 

00:03:56.570 --> 00:04:00.560
 memory 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:03.320
 this is the 16 gigabyte version then 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:05.570
 2GB of RAM available at the price 

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:08.150
 of 599 euros while version from 32 

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:10.430
 gigabytes with 3 gigabytes of RAM is 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:13.540
 available at 699 euros 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:17.299
 lg g3 is available from practically today 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:19.460
 June 23 on large retailers 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:20.540
 then it will also arrive with the various operators 

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:21.650
 you really really want these 

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:23.990
 interesting those features 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:26.990
 the techniques with which it is equipped is the price that 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:29.270
 in line, in fact, slightly less like 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:31.760
 always adopts lg with respect to 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:33.080
 competition for the moment this lg g3 

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:35.510
 i would say that even that was all a 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:37.280
 second best on the software part e 

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:39.110
 although as I said later in the 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:40.130
 review we will talk about precisely 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:41.900
 all its features 

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:44.060
 but as soon as you notice the new one 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:46.550
 lg very graphical interface 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:48.410
 cured with new icons more flex but 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:49.430
 however very very pleasant to 

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:51.500
 view 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:53.390
 the display is fantastic, definitely not 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:55.280
 I will be able to see not even a pixel 

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:56.960
 because the situation can therefore hd 

00:04:55.280 --> 00:05:00.590
 four times the capitalization 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:03.230
 really crazy to see if it will impact 

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:05.750
 too much or too much on the battery from ending 

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:08.870
 milan apparently of this lg 3 for this 

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:10.970
 unboxing I would say that we see everything 

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:14.290
 soon with the review 

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:14.290
 a salute to michael for troy
