00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:45.520
 small touched the hearts of many 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:57.850
 I have a story about a man who has 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:57.850
 wrote a book and then lost it 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:04.989
 that mistakes happens after the old one 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:08.020

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:10.350

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:20.580
 it's not over yet 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:23.130
 I look at my life I look at yours 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.230
 I look at her not just that I thought I was 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.620
 be think there is no price to be 

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:27.720
 to pay 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:28.680
 they are words born of joy et al 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.290
 ache 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.500
 if you steal those words, take the 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.500
 ache 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:46.530
 sooner or later those moments come 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.810
 choose between life and fiction 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.500
 the two things are very close but not yes 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.500

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:57.790
 we all make choices in life 

00:01:54.910 --> 00:02:00.690
 you don't know the difficult to live with 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:00.690
 words ruin everything 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:04.210
