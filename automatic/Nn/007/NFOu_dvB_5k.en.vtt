For this recipe you´ll need,
broccoli

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.939
previously boiled for about three mins.
cream cheese

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:35.820

one fourth of an onion

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.570
a cup of chicken broth
butter

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:45.480
and cheese to decorate
Now we will proceed to blend all the ingredients.

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:58.070
The onion, the chicken broth, and the boiled
broccoli.

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:01.839
We blend.

00:01:01.839 --> 00:01:12.370
Now we proceed by placing butter on a hot
pan, let it melt

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:24.580
We continue with placing the broccoli mix
Add a pinch of baking soda

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:39.820
So your cream will be lump free
Add a pinch of salt

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:49.490
Add some cream cheese
And the sour cream (STUPID PHONE RING!!)

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:55.960
Once it´s warm, serve it in a bowl
I added some chicken cubes

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:00.990
so it would have a light chicken flavor
its ready

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:18.290

and its piece of toast.

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.849
