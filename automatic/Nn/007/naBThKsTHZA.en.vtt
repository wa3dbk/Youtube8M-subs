00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:28.839

 european championship in croatia and the 

00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:33.699
 Hungary with a very strong German 

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:35.019
 group that is really exciting therefore 

00:00:33.699 --> 00:00:36.550
 Let's look at the enemy of the 

00:00:35.019 --> 00:00:38.410
 german team at this em am 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:40.210
 tactics board with our expert 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:42.040
 hendrik little hendrik you train 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:44.019
 even a women's team and up 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:45.670
 proven tactics expert 

00:00:44.019 --> 00:00:48.070
 We'll go in here right now 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:49.720
 board and look at the German 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:51.430
 group there we see the netherlands us 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:54.729
 see a croatia under we see 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:58.570
 Sweden starts on 8 

00:00:54.729 --> 00:01:00.580
 December 18 clock live in sport1 with the 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:02.199
 There were two games in the Netherlands 

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:04.089
 Year two times won two victories 

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:05.650
 second, however, a tight box 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:07.479
 Gate only so you can 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:09.250
 not underestimate or no at all 

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:11.530
 no case so I think it can 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:12.520
 extremely unpleasant up-beat one 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:15.100
 very young dynamic team 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:18.130
 nevertheless with many international 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:20.230
 experienced players in the squad and me 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:22.390
 I think that's a big big boulder 

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:23.560
 is as upbeat which 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:24.190
 actresses have us because on 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:25.060
 most dangerous 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:27.730
 what must the german team do 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:30.280
 I pay special attention to that one 

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:32.170
 that highlight three actresses 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.090
 if you have us look at the squad 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:36.790
 then it will definitely come back 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:38.409
 right laura van der heijden long years 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:41.260
 in the Bundesliga for the VFL Oldenburg 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:42.130
 active over 100 country matches over 300 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.840
 thrown gates 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.210
 very very active there on the back room 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:48.610
 Right position is definitely one 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:50.860
 Player no one has to stop on the 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:52.680
 rear left with the nici grote very 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:56.470
 experienced player already 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:58.540
 long years in denmark active player 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:59.170
 last year here in danish 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:02.440
 league 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:04.540
 that means one one one extreme 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:07.090
 experienced extremely good player 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:09.369
 At the circle we have with the danick 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:11.349
 snelder a very robust very 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:13.540
 physically active circle runners 

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:16.120
 which also in the cover in the inner block 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:17.109
 her wife stands that are in any case 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.130
 the three players you 

00:02:17.109 --> 00:02:21.470
 off needs to 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:23.330
 to win the game as well as we turn 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:24.620
 the perspective is simply hendrik 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:26.720
 look at the defense at the 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:29.390
 Dutchmen if hopefully 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.830
 Susann M端ller should play in the right 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:32.750
 backspace how will they act 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:34.100
 I think you have two test games in the 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:36.410
 summer already a right variant 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:37.880
 seen the Dutch like her 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:39.740
 against susann m端ller with security one 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:41.570
 the best backroom right in the world 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:43.340
 We want to be able to defend that 

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:45.680
 look at the tactics portier front 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:47.480
 susann m端ller backspace right of 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:50.780
 German national team big 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:52.460
 Grown very much threw vigorously here 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:55.060
 Normally the Netherlands is involved 

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:59.120
 a very defensive defender 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:00.560
 I think I expect that we are ahead 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.050
 clearly more offensive acting on the 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:04.790
 halfway you have a 51 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:05.960
 moved against back room right at the 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:07.490
 Susan Miller played in the 

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:09.350
 test games and I believe that 

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:11.180
 a jensen as a nation coach very much 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:12.830
 it will work in the 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:15.200
 reason taken around the circles of 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:17.210
 Susanne M端ller on the way over the center 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.130
 clearly restrict them and always 

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:20.600
 keep away from the food zone 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:22.370
 what else do we have to face ? 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:24.230
 which we have to prevent in any case 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:25.940
 the counter-attacks are Dutch 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:28.340
 They have extremely fast performers 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:31.670
 they will haunt her in salvation 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:33.620
 At the front they try to be little chances 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:35.390
 have against the tall German 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:37.430
 6 0 cover to the goal success in the 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:39.140
 Positional Attack to come that's her name 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:41.810
 must be active on the counter-attack 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:43.970
 and to prevent this is with 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:45.710
 safety a big factor two days 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:48.170
 later the tenth december the second 

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:50.150
 play against co hosts croatia this 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:52.640
 There was a lot of games once a year 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:54.440
 crash adapter , there were 126 to 20 so one 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:55.850
 clear matter what do you think 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:56.240
 now just as easy at the 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:58.280
 marriage 

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:59.660
 I can do that for the sake of the best 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:03.020
 do not expect us 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:04.850
 The host will surely be emotional 

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:07.160
 carried forward by their own fans 

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:08.990
 a very strong dynamic team 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:09.620
 So it will certainly not 

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:11.180
 even runners 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:13.130
 then there's a game against the 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:15.290
 swedish we look at the times 

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:16.700
 Group D that is the group 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:18.049
 in the main round against the German 

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:19.609
 team then on the German 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:22.250
 the team will meet one 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:24.110
 hard group with montenegro with 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:24.880
 france with serbia and with the 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:27.080
 Slovakia 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:28.520
 so if anything falls slovakia 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:30.200
 maybe a little bit off 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:32.330
 all other three teams are 

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:32.660
 absolute world-class teams then switched 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:34.250
 the fact 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:36.080
 reform over the scores after the 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:39.470
 preliminary round for the German team 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:41.510
 It is important to take every point is gold 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:43.310
 worth a defeat in the main round 

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:44.330
 and two points less after the first round 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:45.110
 probably already mean that 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:47.150
 semi-final off 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:49.340
 Thank you for your assessment hendrik 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:51.650
 that was the first issue of 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:54.230
 diabetic special with the opponent check 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:56.030
 the german team at the wm 

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:58.550
 look back in when it says 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:02.890

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:02.890
 from the handball world until then bye 

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:13.730
