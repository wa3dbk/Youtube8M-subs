00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:14.000
 good and welcome to the tasting channel 

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:16.670
 crocker here we are in the 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.529
 chapter 30 of fan skins before 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:20.029
 all I would like to thank you for 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:22.340
 all the corners that you have sent me 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:23.900
 since the previous chapter I remember you 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:25.250
 that if you want to continue doing it you can 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:27.290
 do it through my mail 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:29.750
 electronic tasting crocker at 

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:32.930
 gmail.com or using the hashtag 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:34.520
 skins cata crocker lately seems 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.739
 that the artists are working very 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:38.630
 hard since we have enough skins 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:41.719
 new so having said that 

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:44.240
 we started and the first skin is a project 

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:46.280
 river and as you see your partner appears 

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:48.920
 of theme and up in the back 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.510
 details that never come bad this 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.579
 Skin style without a doubt 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:54.200
 would be well yes but they 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:56.420
 pleasure is amazing and is very good 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:58.250
 raised I think it lacks a touch more 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:00.020
 realistic anyway you have to 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.239
 congratulate the artist because he has made 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:04.309
 a great job I remind you that in the 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:06.110
 description you will find a link to a 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:08.479
 vote to choose your skin 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:10.490
 favorite of the video we continue with this 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:12.619
 skin for nautilus although I have no clear 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:14.509
 the theme on the one hand we have those 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:16.360
 little creatures modifying the 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:18.280
 appearance of nautilus is more 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:21.040
 and we can also appreciate a poster the 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:23.560
 which indicates a change of skins by 675 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:25.720
 rios points on the right side we see a 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.820
 rural environment what makes me doubt about 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:29.980
 The theme could be a 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:32.260
 nautilus farmer or just a 

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:33.910
 metallic skin I do not know but you can 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:36.430
 give me a hand through the 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:38.890
 comments on the illustration of 10 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:41.320
 great quality and a lot of details the 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:43.450
 champion will almost never have skins 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:45.160
 designed by fans but this time 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:47.260
 we can see a thematic one of 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:48.940
 halloween on the one hand it seems very 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:51.160
 similar to the son skin of the runes 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:53.140
 except for the pumpkin but in lines 

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:55.479
 general I think it would be a great idea 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:57.369
 for the next halloween although yes that 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:58.780
 It is true that with some modification of 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:01.270
 riot's hand I think it would be 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:03.280
 perfect brawn has become one 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:05.979
 of the champions with more possibilities 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:08.410
 to create fan skins from circus 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:10.509
 wrestler cook up mobster like 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:12.580
 we see in the image would not rule out that 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:14.350
 over time we could see it in the pp 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.850
 is more if they told me that this 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:17.950
 illustration is made in the 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:20.170
 riot offices I believe it for another 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:22.030
 part it's hard for me to imagine how 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.050
 would be the in game skills of this 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.000
 skin 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:27.070
 what could be the launch of a 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.750
 riad points bag like the one that appears 

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:30.400
 in the lower part although the 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.800
 illustration is not one of the best 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.570
 we have seen the idea I like it a lot 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:36.910
 I'm more surprised that they did not get a 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:38.590
 corner so swain count dracula or al 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:40.020
 least I think that would be his name 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:42.640
 has a lot of possibilities 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:44.050
 regarding his abilities the ultimate 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.910
 would be a pass to see how it 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:47.890
 Transform the bat and see hundreds 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:50.380
 of them fluttering around him 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:52.090
 Good thing lately is Riot 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:53.890
 fixing a lot in the corners created 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:55.840
 by the community although initially 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:57.880
 I thought it was leasing, do not ask me 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:00.070
 because it's about looking street or 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:01.810
 they looked like the neighborhood chungo I do not know is that 

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:03.700
 I can think of a perfect name for the 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.410
 skin go maybe the dress me 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.690
 Remember the 'leasing' pool party and 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:09.430
 for that reason the details confusion does not 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:11.830
 They are missing mostly brand shoes 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:13.600
 rite it's time to take out a skin 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:15.280
 decent to look did not say that the 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:17.170
 last with the world's theme I'm 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.090
 bad but this champion deserves something better 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:21.700
 especially seeing the amount of ideas 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:24.010
 that the fans propose now is the turn 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:25.660
 of project of and now or wicks and now 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:27.790
 I do not know but I think that's what 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:29.590
 less the illustration is incredible to the 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:31.360
 less from my point of view 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:33.640
 I'm wrong and now it's on the list of 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:35.470
 work at the skill level and since it 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:37.780
 they could get a skin next to the 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:40.150
 King word if it is this skin or similar would be 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:42.069
 all a success I would like to see in game 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:44.410
 those tapes as if holograms are 

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:46.299
 try on about the number 5 on your helmet 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:48.580
 I still think with what I can 

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:50.530
 have a relationship could be the number that 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:52.780
 corresponds to the skin as it happened with 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:54.610
 wick atrox and evil fight and the next 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:56.560
 skin belongs to vi with thematic of 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:58.569
 georg frames another champion which 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:59.530
 has hundreds of ideas for new 

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:01.360
 skins 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:03.280
 this time we see how he has those 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:05.110
 bear fists similar to those of the 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:07.299
 corner of bolivar runic guardian 

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:08.860
 would be nice to have if 

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:11.079
 a new frei lior event with the 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:13.569
 time you take on skins for champions 

00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:15.010
 alien to this location an event in 

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:17.350
 which champions of other cities 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:19.540
 you travel in the north to fight an evil 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:21.789
 old for dreaming that is not and 

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:24.280
 we will finish the video with two skins 

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:26.650
 the hand of the great vega colors known 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:28.750
 for your great ideas for skin here 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:30.460
 we can see here blue flame lists what 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:32.800
 good thing about this artist is that we always 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:34.630
 shows how your skills would 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:36.580
 regarding the theme of the skin for a 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:38.470
 part seems to me similar to the main 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:40.659
 but the touch of the armor makes me 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:42.639
 like it much more, it seems to me soon 

00:04:40.659 --> 00:04:44.919
 for which calista receives a skin but 

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:46.750
 this would be a very good option for 

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:48.969
 last and also designed by vega 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:50.860
 colors as I said before we have a 

00:04:48.969 --> 00:04:53.169
 this blue toy keeps on fascinating me 

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:55.389
 the great ideas you have for 

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:57.189
 skins fixed from the turret with 

00:04:55.389 --> 00:04:59.439
 pieces of lego up to the little soldiers 

00:04:57.189 --> 00:05:01.629
 lead I hope that with time I decide 

00:04:59.439 --> 00:05:03.400
 perform splash are from this skin as 

00:05:01.629 --> 00:05:05.530
 many you know first makes small 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:07.389
 sketches like this one and the one you like most is 

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:09.940
 the one chosen to make an illustration 

00:05:07.389 --> 00:05:12.039
 and good until here chapter 30 of 

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:14.169
