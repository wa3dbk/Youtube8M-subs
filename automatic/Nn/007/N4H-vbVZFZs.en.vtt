that does is it'll help it slide on
really<00:01:53.610> easily<00:01:53.640> and<00:01:53.970> then<00:01:54.299> after<00:01:54.600> it<00:01:54.720> dries

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
really easily and then after it dries

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.469 
really easily and then after it dries
it'll<00:01:55.200> stick<00:01:55.530> so<00:01:56.399> a<00:01:56.430> lot<00:01:56.880> of<00:01:56.909> people<00:01:57.060> will<00:01:57.329> do
