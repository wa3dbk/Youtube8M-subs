who aren't part of our industry no other

00:03:57.569 --> 00:03:59.719 
who aren't part of our industry no other
school<00:03:57.870> would<00:03:58.049> do<00:03:58.199> it<00:03:58.349> like<00:03:58.469> this<00:03:58.650> and<00:03:58.979> I<00:03:59.519> think

00:03:59.719 --> 00:03:59.729 
school would do it like this and I think

00:03:59.729 --> 00:04:02.330 
school would do it like this and I think
as<00:03:59.819> a<00:03:59.849> group<00:04:00.150> we<00:04:00.419> took<00:04:00.599> away<00:04:00.750> so<00:04:01.739> much<00:04:01.979> more

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 
as a group we took away so much more

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:04.729 
as a group we took away so much more
than<00:04:02.549> just<00:04:02.579> a<00:04:02.879> classroom<00:04:03.120> lesson<00:04:03.509> it<00:04:04.409> was<00:04:04.530> more

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:04.739 
than just a classroom lesson it was more

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:06.110 
than just a classroom lesson it was more
of<00:04:04.829> a<00:04:04.919> culture<00:04:05.519> and<00:04:05.669> immersing<00:04:06.030> ourselves

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
of a culture and immersing ourselves

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.629
