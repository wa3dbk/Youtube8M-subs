coming<00:00:44.720> about<00:00:44.989> timing<00:00:45.260> starts<00:00:45.559> straighten<00:00:46.040> up

00:00:46.119 --> 00:00:46.129

a<00:00:46.190> little<00:00:46.370> bit<00:00:46.460> like<00:00:46.580> this<00:00:46.760> it<00:00:47.030> would<00:00:47.150> it<00:00:47.360> would

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:47.510 
a little bit like this it would it would

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:50.020 
a little bit like this it would it would
hook<00:00:48.050> right<00:00:48.309> you<00:00:49.309> know<00:00:49.400> I<00:00:49.430> could<00:00:49.640> follow<00:00:49.820> an
