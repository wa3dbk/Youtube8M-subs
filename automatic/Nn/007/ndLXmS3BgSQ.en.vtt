00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 hello I will greet you sahin study welcome to this tutorial we look forward 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:06.350
 that is useful to you 

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:10.160
 but first let me tell you that from now on we will be using a 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:13.129
 voice synthesizer for our tutorials 

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:15.089
 will they wonder why 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.330
 Well, because nobody's way is easier for us to explain some things to 

00:00:19.329 --> 00:00:23.579
 Unlike when we post them on a blog and the truth to many people 

00:00:23.579 --> 00:00:26.470
 we find the voice he uses funny 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:30.749
 fuck the tutorial today is about how to make animations in the sketch adp 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.780
 to start what you have to do is place the camera in a view of your 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:40.520
 project that you like or where you're going to start doing your tour of this that 

00:00:40.519 --> 00:00:42.150
 it will be your first scene 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:46.320
 clarifying that a scene is not the time it takes for the camera to arrive from a 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.370
 place to another if not what is displayed at a certain time 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:55.330
 go to the menu bar and open the window menu and click on the 

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:57.050
 option scenes 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:01.160
 a dialogue box will appear for the configuration of the scenes 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.170
 and we will click on the option add scene 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.090
 we will see that a tab with the name appears on the edge of the screen 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:09.300
 scene 1 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:13.760
 then we choose another view of the project we can do this by orbiting 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:18.220
 dragging our project closer or further away from the bar 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:19.780
 walking tools 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.630
 in this there are three very useful tools especially when it comes to making 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:26.290
 an internal animation of the project 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:29.720
 these are to place each mara walking said to turn 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:33.760
 the first is as if we told the program where we are going to 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:34.900
 stop 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:37.920
 walking serves what the hell 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.120
 I do not like this tool very much 

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:42.050
 I leave them homework 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:45.450
 and turn is how it is to see in some specific direction 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.220
 not like the orbiting tool 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.400
 since with this the observer moves around the project turn rather 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:54.660
 it's like when we turn our heads in some direction 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:58.520
 also with these it is possible to control the height of the observer 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:59.740
 if you look closely 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.799
 a value for that height appears in the dimension bar 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:04.930
 by the way 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:07.670
 what the hell was he talking about? 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:12.320
 already having the following view we repeat the previous process to add the 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:14.009
 next scene 

00:02:14.009 --> 00:02:18.059
 this process is valid for exteriors and interiors a couple of recommendations 

00:02:18.059 --> 00:02:22.949
 for interiors carefully check your scenes to verify that you are not going to 

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:27.719
 traverse the walls uses the tool its keyboard letter z shortcut 

00:02:27.719 --> 00:02:30.819
 to change the viewing angle for example to 60 degrees 

00:02:31.359 --> 00:02:35.409
 this will make your perspective broader by default in the program comes 

00:02:35.409 --> 00:02:37.709
 set at 35 degrees 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:41.230
 Now what if we are interested in showing a plant 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:44.510
 sectioned facade must be activated option 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:47.079
 parallel projection on the menu 

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:51.029
 then in the toolbar sections we select the option 

00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:55.430
 place a section plane and place it in our project so that 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:00.010
 show what does not interest later in the view toolbar 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:04.140
 we select the view that we need, whether it is a plant or an elevation 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:07.569
 depending on how we are located our plan or section 

00:03:08.189 --> 00:03:12.359
 it is possible to place several section planes at a time what is important to 

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:16.400
 moment to create the scene is to define which plane is the one that defines the cut 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.639
 active to know this just right click on the section plane 

00:03:20.639 --> 00:03:25.079
 these planes can also be hidden by deactivating the show planes option 

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:28.139
 section in the section toolbar 

00:03:28.139 --> 00:03:30.659
 if we do not need to show any cut 

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:31.419
 for example 

00:03:31.419 --> 00:03:33.790
 if what we want is to show a facade 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:36.790
 we deactivate the option show polite disappointment 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:41.759
 just like any modeling program in 3d is that cup works in 

00:03:41.759 --> 00:03:46.199
 layers these layers can be activated and deactivated at will 

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:47.099
 on the menu 

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:49.230
 window we select the option 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:50.259
 tastings 

00:03:50.259 --> 00:03:54.369
 when creating the scene we must first have defined which layers are 

00:03:54.369 --> 00:03:55.709
 those that are active 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:59.459
 to show only what interests us if afterwards we want to do some 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:02.389
 change will have to update the scene 

00:04:02.389 --> 00:04:03.519
 I forgot 

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:07.989
 To change the duration of the scenes, click on the information button of the 

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:09.900
 model if you can not find it 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.370
 open the window menu and click on the option 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:17.030
 model information a window will appear in the left panel click 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:18.729
 where it says animations 

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:23.210
 two boxes will appear, I'm not going to explain them. 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:27.479
 experiment with different values ​​until you are satisfied with the result 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:32.759
 Once the animation is finished, we can export it to a video format 

00:04:32.759 --> 00:04:33.490
 for this 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:37.749
 open the file menu and select the option export animation 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.889
 well for now I think this is all we hope your comments 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:44.729
 questions and suggestions 

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:47.370
 you say goodbye to you and in study 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:49.099
 and remember that if you drive 

00:04:49.099 --> 00:04:51.419
 do not drink and if you take a treat
