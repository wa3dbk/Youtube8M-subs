woodlands<00:00:22.380> now<00:00:22.590> we<00:00:22.650> thought<00:00:22.949> that<00:00:23.189> we<00:00:23.369> had

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
woodlands now we thought that we had

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.759 
woodlands now we thought that we had
started<00:00:23.789> to<00:00:23.939> walk<00:00:24.240> on<00:00:24.449> two<00:00:24.630> legs<00:00:24.660> when<00:00:25.410> we<00:00:25.560> went

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
started to walk on two legs when we went

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.339 
started to walk on two legs when we went
to<00:00:25.830> the<00:00:26.070> Savannah<00:00:26.519> right<00:00:27.029> no<00:00:27.539> and<00:00:28.199> the

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
to the Savannah right no and the

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.259 
to the Savannah right no and the
grasslands<00:00:28.830> but<00:00:29.070> no<00:00:29.220> she's<00:00:29.460> in<00:00:29.490> the<00:00:29.669> woods<00:00:29.820> but

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
grasslands but no she's in the woods but

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.359 
grasslands but no she's in the woods but
she's<00:00:30.419> walking<00:00:30.779> on<00:00:30.869> two<00:00:31.019> legs<00:00:31.050> now<00:00:32.040> she<00:00:32.099> has<00:00:32.340> a

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
she's walking on two legs now she has a

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.850 
she's walking on two legs now she has a
lot<00:00:32.520> of<00:00:32.550> ape-like<00:00:33.000> features<00:00:33.350> but<00:00:34.350> she<00:00:34.590> also

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
lot of ape-like features but she also

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.040 
lot of ape-like features but she also
has<00:00:35.340> human-like<00:00:35.940> features<00:00:36.149> and<00:00:36.510> the<00:00:36.570> most

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
has human-like features and the most

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.260 
has human-like features and the most
important<00:00:37.530> one<00:00:37.680> is<00:00:37.890> the<00:00:38.579> walking<00:00:38.910> on<00:00:39.030> two<00:00:39.239> legs

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
important one is the walking on two legs

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:40.790 
important one is the walking on two legs
and<00:00:39.750> being<00:00:39.960> able<00:00:40.050> to<00:00:40.140> use<00:00:40.320> our<00:00:40.440> hands<00:00:40.620> for

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
and being able to use our hands for

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.709 
and being able to use our hands for
other<00:00:40.890> things<00:00:41.010> okay<00:00:41.760> but<00:00:42.270> she<00:00:42.420> could<00:00:42.539> still

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
other things okay but she could still

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:43.549 
other things okay but she could still
climb<00:00:42.989> on<00:00:43.199> trees

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
climb on trees

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.010 
climb on trees
so<00:00:44.340> she's<00:00:44.670> got<00:00:44.850> a<00:00:44.879> little<00:00:45.120> little<00:00:45.329> both<00:00:45.539> that's

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
so she's got a little little both that's

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.080 
so she's got a little little both that's
why<00:00:46.320> some<00:00:46.890> people<00:00:46.920> are<00:00:47.160> referring<00:00:47.489> to<00:00:47.730> her<00:00:47.850> as

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
why some people are referring to her as

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.930 
why some people are referring to her as
the<00:00:48.210> missing<00:00:48.570> link<00:00:48.600> that's<00:00:49.289> why<00:00:49.469> she's<00:00:49.739> a<00:00:49.940> in

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
the missing link that's why she's a in

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.060 
the missing link that's why she's a in
in<00:00:51.149> layman's<00:00:51.510> terms<00:00:51.719> a<00:00:51.899> transitional<00:00:52.620> fossil

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
in layman's terms a transitional fossil

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.369 
in layman's terms a transitional fossil
transitioning<00:00:53.760> from<00:00:54.120> ape<00:00:54.420> to<00:00:54.809> human<00:00:54.840> right

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
transitioning from ape to human right

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:56.810 
transitioning from ape to human right
although<00:00:55.710> as<00:00:55.829> I<00:00:55.949> explained<00:00:56.340> we<00:00:56.699> all

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
although as I explained we all

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.299 
although as I explained we all
transition<00:00:57.449> to<00:00:57.840> wherever<00:00:58.019> we're<00:00:58.379> going<00:00:58.410> okay

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
transition to wherever we're going okay

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.229 
transition to wherever we're going okay
now<00:01:00.320> why<00:01:01.320> did<00:01:01.800> she<00:01:01.829> while<00:01:02.550> she's<00:01:02.820> still<00:01:03.000> in<00:01:03.120> the

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
now why did she while she's still in the

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:04.910 
now why did she while she's still in the
woods<00:01:03.390> okay<00:01:04.170> and<00:01:04.440> she<00:01:04.650> of<00:01:04.739> course

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
woods okay and she of course

not<00:01:20.790> bad<00:01:21.090> dammit<00:01:21.900> Jim<00:01:22.200> I'm<00:01:22.380> a<00:01:22.470> talk<00:01:22.710> show<00:01:22.740> host

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
not bad dammit Jim I'm a talk show host

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.010 
not bad dammit Jim I'm a talk show host
not<00:01:23.250> a<00:01:23.280> scientist<00:01:23.729> but<00:01:23.880> I<00:01:24.000> love<00:01:24.240> evolution<00:01:24.689> all

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
not a scientist but I love evolution all

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.200 
not a scientist but I love evolution all
right<00:01:25.170> so<00:01:25.290> we<00:01:25.409> move<00:01:25.560> forward<00:01:25.829> in<00:01:26.610> this<00:01:26.759> slight

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
right so we move forward in this slight

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.410 
right so we move forward in this slight
oversimplification<00:01:28.170> so<00:01:28.470> but<00:01:28.650> why<00:01:28.829> is<00:01:28.890> she<00:01:29.420> in

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
oversimplification so but why is she in

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.200 
oversimplification so but why is she in
the<00:01:30.600> woods<00:01:30.840> and<00:01:31.140> walking<00:01:31.500> on<00:01:31.590> two<00:01:31.860> feet<00:01:32.310> right

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
the woods and walking on two feet right

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:33.770 
the woods and walking on two feet right
now

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
now

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.899 
now
normally<00:01:34.290> in<00:01:34.350> the<00:01:34.439> woods<00:01:34.619> you're<00:01:34.799> easier<00:01:35.729> to

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
normally in the woods you're easier to

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.780 
normally in the woods you're easier to
climb<00:01:36.149> with<00:01:36.329> using<00:01:36.960> all<00:01:37.140> four<00:01:37.470> limbs<00:01:37.790> well

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
climb with using all four limbs well

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.289 
climb with using all four limbs well
scientists<00:01:39.780> say<00:01:40.590> it's<00:01:40.829> because<00:01:41.250> of<00:01:41.490> the<00:01:42.090> males

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
scientists say it's because of the males

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:46.480 
scientists say it's because of the males
in<00:01:42.540> the<00:01:42.659> species<00:01:43.759> the<00:01:44.759> problem<00:01:45.180> was<00:01:45.390> that

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 
in the species the problem was that

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:48.800 
in the species the problem was that
normally<00:01:47.490> in<00:01:47.640> evolution<00:01:48.180> what<00:01:48.299> happens<00:01:48.630> is<00:01:48.780> a

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
normally in evolution what happens is a

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.830 
normally in evolution what happens is a
woman<00:01:49.170> shows<00:01:49.409> that<00:01:49.530> she's<00:01:49.799> ovulating<00:01:50.520> in<00:01:51.450> some

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
woman shows that she's ovulating in some

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.830 
woman shows that she's ovulating in some
in<00:01:52.770> a<00:01:52.890> lot<00:01:53.070> of<00:01:53.100> cases<00:01:53.369> in<00:01:53.700> some<00:01:54.119> obvious<00:01:54.600> way

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
in a lot of cases in some obvious way

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.709 
in a lot of cases in some obvious way
right<00:01:55.290> and<00:01:55.799> her<00:01:56.369> generals<00:01:56.850> might<00:01:57.060> swell<00:01:57.390> up<00:01:57.570> or

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
right and her generals might swell up or

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:00.770 
right and her generals might swell up or
they<00:01:57.869> might<00:01:58.049> become<00:01:58.350> red<00:01:58.799> as<00:01:59.670> a<00:01:59.729> clue<00:02:00.299> to<00:02:00.750> the

they might become red as a clue to the

they might become red as a clue to the
males<00:02:01.200> in<00:02:01.380> the<00:02:01.469> species<00:02:01.680> hey<00:02:02.460> it's<00:02:02.670> time<00:02:02.789> to

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
males in the species hey it's time to

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.029 
males in the species hey it's time to
hit<00:02:03.119> it<00:02:03.210> okay<00:02:04.110> I<00:02:04.530> told<00:02:04.799> you<00:02:04.920> we're

00:02:05.029 --> 00:02:05.039 
hit it okay I told you we're

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:08.540 
hit it okay I told you we're
oversimplified<00:02:05.700> right<00:02:06.259> and<00:02:07.259> so<00:02:08.100> that's<00:02:08.310> when

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
oversimplified right and so that's when

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.760 
oversimplified right and so that's when
the<00:02:08.700> big<00:02:08.880> males<00:02:09.180> in<00:02:09.509> the<00:02:09.869> species<00:02:10.410> with<00:02:10.590> either

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
the big males in the species with either

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.160 
the big males in the species with either
larger<00:02:11.190> canine<00:02:11.580> teeth<00:02:11.820> are<00:02:12.120> stronger<00:02:12.630> come

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
larger canine teeth are stronger come

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:14.570 
larger canine teeth are stronger come
and<00:02:13.350> compete<00:02:13.650> with<00:02:13.830> one<00:02:13.980> another<00:02:14.010> end<00:02:14.460> they

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
and compete with one another end they

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:15.830 
and compete with one another end they
wind<00:02:14.820> up<00:02:14.970> with<00:02:15.210> the<00:02:15.300> biggest<00:02:15.630> and<00:02:15.780> the

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
wind up with the biggest and the

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:16.610 
wind up with the biggest and the
toughest<00:02:16.140> one

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
toughest one

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.110 
toughest one
winds<00:02:16.890> up<00:02:17.010> winning<00:02:17.129> over<00:02:17.400> the<00:02:17.489> woman<00:02:17.790> and<00:02:18.000> then

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
winds up winning over the woman and then

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.699 
winds up winning over the woman and then
you<00:02:18.239> get<00:02:18.390> more<00:02:18.599> and<00:02:18.720> more<00:02:18.780> alpha<00:02:19.290> genes<00:02:19.500> out

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
you get more and more alpha genes out

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:22.880 
you get more and more alpha genes out
there<00:02:19.950> so<00:02:20.910> in<00:02:21.060> order<00:02:21.150> to<00:02:21.300> compete<00:02:21.680> the<00:02:22.680> ones

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
there so in order to compete the ones

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.740 
there so in order to compete the ones
that<00:02:23.069> were<00:02:23.190> not<00:02:23.220> as<00:02:23.580> big<00:02:23.819> came<00:02:24.420> up<00:02:24.569> with<00:02:24.690> the

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
that were not as big came up with the

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.660 
that were not as big came up with the
idea<00:02:25.019> hey<00:02:25.410> why<00:02:25.739> don't<00:02:26.640> I<00:02:27.120> bring<00:02:27.180> her<00:02:27.810> food

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
idea hey why don't I bring her food

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.540 
idea hey why don't I bring her food
maybe<00:02:29.670> all<00:02:30.000> curry<00:02:30.480> favor<00:02:30.840> that<00:02:31.080> way<00:02:31.290> kind<00:02:32.280> of

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
maybe all curry favor that way kind of

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:34.610 
maybe all curry favor that way kind of
reminds<00:02:32.879> me<00:02:33.030> of<00:02:33.150> a<00:02:33.299> thing<00:02:33.599> called<00:02:33.930> a<00:02:34.140> date

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
reminds me of a thing called a date

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.910 
reminds me of a thing called a date
where<00:02:35.430> we<00:02:35.459> take<00:02:35.849> him<00:02:36.030> out<00:02:36.180> to<00:02:36.330> dinner<00:02:36.360> okay<00:02:37.019> and

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
where we take him out to dinner okay and

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.800 
where we take him out to dinner okay and
this<00:02:38.099> is<00:02:38.280> this<00:02:38.610> is<00:02:38.730> totally<00:02:39.120> true<00:02:39.360> okay<00:02:39.660> and

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
this is this is totally true okay and

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.630 
this is this is totally true okay and
that's<00:02:39.930> what's<00:02:40.110> great<00:02:40.440> and<00:02:40.709> amazing<00:02:40.920> about<00:02:41.340> it

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
that's what's great and amazing about it

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.170 
that's what's great and amazing about it
and<00:02:42.060> so<00:02:43.019> why<00:02:43.260> are<00:02:43.319> they<00:02:43.500> walking<00:02:43.739> on<00:02:43.980> two<00:02:44.129> feet

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.180 
and so why are they walking on two feet

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:47.960 
and so why are they walking on two feet
to<00:02:45.180> be<00:02:45.330> able<00:02:45.569> to<00:02:45.930> hold<00:02:46.170> the<00:02:46.410> food<00:02:46.760> so<00:02:47.760> they

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
to be able to hold the food so they

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.030 
to be able to hold the food so they
would<00:02:48.180> go<00:02:48.360> pick<00:02:48.660> up<00:02:48.720> the<00:02:49.170> fruits<00:02:49.530> whatever

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
would go pick up the fruits whatever

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.940 
would go pick up the fruits whatever
else<00:02:50.400> not<00:02:50.819> nuts<00:02:51.329> etc<00:02:51.989> and<00:02:52.170> in<00:02:52.590> order<00:02:52.769> to<00:02:52.829> be

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
else not nuts etc and in order to be

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:54.350 
else not nuts etc and in order to be
able<00:02:53.010> to<00:02:53.130> hold<00:02:53.340> it<00:02:53.519> they<00:02:53.579> got<00:02:53.730> to<00:02:53.819> walk<00:02:53.970> on<00:02:54.120> two

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
able to hold it they got to walk on two

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:55.819 
able to hold it they got to walk on two
feet<00:02:54.390> which<00:02:54.900> is<00:02:54.930> otherwise<00:02:55.440> not<00:02:55.650> as

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:55.829 
feet which is otherwise not as

00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:57.860 
feet which is otherwise not as
advantageous<00:02:56.130> so<00:02:57.030> then<00:02:57.150> they<00:02:57.239> bring<00:02:57.480> it<00:02:57.569> over

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
advantageous so then they bring it over

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:59.750 
advantageous so then they bring it over
now<00:02:58.019> this<00:02:58.680> leads<00:02:58.920> to<00:02:59.069> more<00:02:59.190> monogamous

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
now this leads to more monogamous

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.400 
now this leads to more monogamous
relationships<00:03:00.420> it<00:03:00.630> leads<00:03:00.959> to<00:03:01.110> the

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
relationships it leads to the

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.130 
relationships it leads to the
evolutionary<00:03:01.950> advantage<00:03:02.069> for<00:03:02.579> those

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:03.140 
evolutionary advantage for those

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:06.850 
evolutionary advantage for those
particular<00:03:04.140> kinds<00:03:04.620> of<00:03:04.739> males<00:03:05.250> okay<00:03:06.000> as<00:03:06.150> the

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:06.860 
particular kinds of males okay as the

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:09.350 
particular kinds of males okay as the
all<00:03:07.860> the<00:03:08.069> species<00:03:08.310> transition<00:03:08.970> in<00:03:09.060> this<00:03:09.180> case

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 
all the species transition in this case

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.390 
all the species transition in this case
this<00:03:09.720> particular<00:03:10.260> species<00:03:10.500> transitions<00:03:11.190> and

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
this particular species transitions and

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.589 
this particular species transitions and
then<00:03:13.099> so<00:03:14.099> at<00:03:14.640> the<00:03:14.790> problem<00:03:15.090> is<00:03:15.180> the<00:03:15.299> women

00:03:15.589 --> 00:03:15.599 
then so at the problem is the women

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:17.479 
then so at the problem is the women
could<00:03:15.930> if<00:03:16.110> they<00:03:16.290> have<00:03:16.530> obvious<00:03:17.040> signs<00:03:17.340> of

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
could if they have obvious signs of

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:19.670 
could if they have obvious signs of
ovulation<00:03:18.079> obviously<00:03:19.079> the<00:03:19.140> males<00:03:19.319> enter

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
ovulation obviously the males enter

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.319 
ovulation obviously the males enter
themselves<00:03:20.250> even<00:03:20.760> like<00:03:20.850> oh<00:03:20.940> that's<00:03:21.120> great

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:21.329 
themselves even like oh that's great

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:23.539 
themselves even like oh that's great
food<00:03:21.540> really<00:03:21.750> appreciate<00:03:22.290> it<00:03:22.470> and<00:03:22.590> while<00:03:23.280> he's

00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:23.549 
food really appreciate it and while he's

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:24.800 
food really appreciate it and while he's
not<00:03:23.579> looking<00:03:23.760> in<00:03:24.359> the<00:03:24.420> middle<00:03:24.630> of<00:03:24.690> their

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
not looking in the middle of their

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:28.460 
not looking in the middle of their
ovulation<00:03:25.170> they're<00:03:25.440> like<00:03:26.690> Franco<00:03:27.690> over<00:03:28.290> here

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
ovulation they're like Franco over here

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:33.229 
ovulation they're like Franco over here
right<00:03:29.120> Franco<00:03:30.590> and<00:03:31.590> they<00:03:32.250> go<00:03:32.400> and<00:03:32.670> mate<00:03:33.090> with

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:33.239 
right Franco and they go and mate with

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:35.030 
right Franco and they go and mate with
what<00:03:33.660> the<00:03:33.780> bigger<00:03:33.959> guys<00:03:34.200> right<00:03:34.620> and<00:03:34.829> then<00:03:34.950> it's

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
what the bigger guys right and then it's

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.599 
what the bigger guys right and then it's
a<00:03:35.130> win-win<00:03:35.310> for<00:03:35.489> them<00:03:35.790> but<00:03:36.359> in<00:03:36.569> as<00:03:36.870> our<00:03:37.650> as<00:03:38.130> Homo

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:38.609 
a win-win for them but in as our as Homo

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:40.129 
a win-win for them but in as our as Homo
sapiens<00:03:39.180> developed<00:03:39.660> through<00:03:39.900> these

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:40.139 
sapiens developed through these

00:03:40.139 --> 00:03:44.500 
sapiens developed through these
different<00:03:40.410> lines<00:03:42.109> ovulation<00:03:43.109> was<00:03:43.319> not

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:44.510 
different lines ovulation was not

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:47.569 
different lines ovulation was not
physically<00:03:45.510> apparent<00:03:46.109> in<00:03:46.260> women<00:03:46.709> okay<00:03:47.280> now

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:47.579 
physically apparent in women okay now

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:49.280 
physically apparent in women okay now
you<00:03:47.639> know<00:03:47.880> you<00:03:47.940> have<00:03:48.030> your<00:03:48.269> cycles<00:03:48.690> etc<00:03:49.109> right

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
you know you have your cycles etc right

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:50.780 
you know you have your cycles etc right
and<00:03:49.470> you<00:03:49.530> get<00:03:49.650> to<00:03:49.739> learn<00:03:49.950> the<00:03:50.130> cycles<00:03:50.579> right

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790 
and you get to learn the cycles right

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:52.460 
and you get to learn the cycles right
but<00:03:51.209> it's<00:03:51.329> not<00:03:51.389> like<00:03:51.660> there's<00:03:51.840> a<00:03:51.900> big<00:03:52.079> glowing

okay so then evolutionary advantage goes

00:04:24.719 --> 00:04:26.779 
okay so then evolutionary advantage goes
to<00:04:24.750> the<00:04:24.930> people<00:04:25.260> walking<00:04:25.680> on<00:04:25.770> males<00:04:26.340> walking

00:04:26.779 --> 00:04:26.789 
to the people walking on males walking

00:04:26.789 --> 00:04:27.409 
to the people walking on males walking
on<00:04:26.909> two<00:04:27.120> feet

00:04:27.409 --> 00:04:27.419 
on two feet

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:30.230 
on two feet
and<00:04:27.930> carrying<00:04:28.440> the<00:04:28.500> food<00:04:28.710> to<00:04:28.890> the<00:04:28.979> women<00:04:29.250> so

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:30.240 
and carrying the food to the women so

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:31.850 
and carrying the food to the women so
that's<00:04:30.419> why<00:04:30.599> we<00:04:30.780> transition<00:04:31.380> to<00:04:31.410> walking<00:04:31.830> in

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:31.860 
that's why we transition to walking in

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:33.860 
that's why we transition to walking in
two<00:04:32.099> feet<00:04:32.340> and<00:04:32.520> that's<00:04:32.880> where<00:04:33.090> RT<00:04:33.449> comes<00:04:33.599> into

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:33.870 
two feet and that's where RT comes into

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:35.270 
two feet and that's where RT comes into
the<00:04:33.930> picture<00:04:34.080> because<00:04:34.560> that's<00:04:34.949> when<00:04:35.160> they

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:35.280 
the picture because that's when they

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:37.550 
the picture because that's when they
start<00:04:35.550> collecting<00:04:36.060> the<00:04:36.240> food<00:04:36.479> and<00:04:36.810> using<00:04:37.440> the

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:37.560 
start collecting the food and using the

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:40.820 
start collecting the food and using the
two<00:04:37.710> feet<00:04:37.889> etcetera<00:04:38.370> now<00:04:39.360> I<00:04:39.569> know<00:04:39.780> I<00:04:40.050> look<00:04:40.680> and

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:40.830 
two feet etcetera now I know I look and

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:42.650 
two feet etcetera now I know I look and
I<00:04:40.949> might<00:04:41.130> even<00:04:41.250> gotten<00:04:41.639> small<00:04:42.090> details<00:04:42.509> a

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:42.660 
I might even gotten small details a

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:44.839 
I might even gotten small details a
little<00:04:42.810> off<00:04:43.050> right<00:04:43.289> species<00:04:43.830> family<00:04:44.039> etc<00:04:44.310> and

00:04:44.839 --> 00:04:44.849 
little off right species family etc and

00:04:44.849 --> 00:04:45.980 
little off right species family etc and
I<00:04:45.240> know<00:04:45.300> it's<00:04:45.539> a<00:04:45.630> gross<00:04:45.840> oversimplification

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:45.990 
I know it's a gross oversimplification

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:47.839 
I know it's a gross oversimplification
but<00:04:46.889> that's<00:04:47.069> the<00:04:47.310> bottom<00:04:47.610> line

00:04:47.839 --> 00:04:47.849 
but that's the bottom line

00:04:47.849 --> 00:04:50.689 
but that's the bottom line
of<00:04:48.060> how<00:04:48.270> it<00:04:48.389> happened<00:04:48.750> and<00:04:48.870> it's<00:04:49.410> awesome<00:04:50.039> and

00:04:50.689 --> 00:04:50.699 
of how it happened and it's awesome and

00:04:50.699 --> 00:04:52.430 
of how it happened and it's awesome and
then<00:04:51.150> if<00:04:51.300> you<00:04:51.419> look<00:04:51.569> at<00:04:51.690> all<00:04:51.870> that<00:04:52.110> and<00:04:52.319> then

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:52.440 
then if you look at all that and then

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:54.350 
then if you look at all that and then
you<00:04:52.560> go<00:04:52.680> oh<00:04:52.889> no<00:04:53.190> way<00:04:53.610> man

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:54.360

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:57.000 
God just took the rib from Adam and made

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.969 
God just took the rib from Adam and made
