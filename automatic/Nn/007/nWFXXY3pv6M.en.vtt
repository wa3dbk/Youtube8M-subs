00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
rock off the course as well which is

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.149 
rock off the course as well which is
kind<00:01:27.900> of<00:01:28.020> what<00:01:28.140> I've<00:01:28.229> been<00:01:28.259> focused<00:01:28.770> on<00:01:28.860> as<00:01:29.040> far

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
kind of what I've been focused on as far

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.890 
kind of what I've been focused on as far
as<00:01:29.220> my<00:01:29.400> golf<00:01:29.670> gear<00:01:29.850> I<00:01:30.060> want<00:01:30.390> to<00:01:30.450> find<00:01:30.600> something

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
as my golf gear I want to find something

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.749 
as my golf gear I want to find something
that<00:01:30.930> looks<00:01:31.200> dope<00:01:31.470> off<00:01:31.680> court<00:01:32.130> off<00:01:32.340> the<00:01:32.549> course

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
that looks dope off court off the course

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.240 
that looks dope off court off the course
as<00:01:33.000> well<00:01:33.270> as<00:01:33.450> on<00:01:33.689> of<00:01:33.900> course<00:01:33.930> and<00:01:34.350> I<00:01:34.770> think<00:01:34.829> this

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
as well as on of course and I think this

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.560 
as well as on of course and I think this
definitely<00:01:35.490> fits<00:01:36.030> the<00:01:36.150> bill

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
definitely fits the bill

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.109 
definitely fits the bill
so<00:01:36.869> they<00:01:37.049> also<00:01:37.259> hooked<00:01:38.070> me<00:01:38.250> up<00:01:38.280> with<00:01:38.400> a<00:01:38.790> golf

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
so they also hooked me up with a golf

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.130 
so they also hooked me up with a golf
shirt<00:01:39.479> I<00:01:39.869> really<00:01:40.680> like<00:01:40.829> the<00:01:40.979> Nike<00:01:41.130> golf<00:01:41.460> shirts

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.140

especially the ones that just say golf
on<00:01:44.369> them<00:01:44.520> I<00:01:44.970> think<00:01:45.270> it<00:01:45.540> just<00:01:45.630> it's<00:01:45.899> like<00:01:45.960> a<00:01:46.079> new

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
on them I think it just it's like a new

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.800 
on them I think it just it's like a new
look<00:01:46.590> for<00:01:47.340> Nike<00:01:47.790> golf<00:01:48.119> like<00:01:48.329> just<00:01:48.570> kind<00:01:48.780> of

look for Nike golf like just kind of

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.630 
look for Nike golf like just kind of
going<00:01:48.960> a<00:01:49.110> little<00:01:49.229> more<00:01:49.500> it's<00:01:49.890> younger<00:01:50.189> it's

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
going a little more it's younger it's

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.310 
going a little more it's younger it's
younger<00:01:51.090> basically<00:01:51.600> what<00:01:51.780> I'm<00:01:51.869> trying<00:01:52.079> to<00:01:52.110> say

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
younger basically what I'm trying to say

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.319 
younger basically what I'm trying to say
and<00:01:52.500> so<00:01:53.280> there<00:01:53.460> he<00:01:53.549> goes<00:01:53.700> with<00:01:53.729> the<00:01:53.909> golf<00:01:54.149> so

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329
