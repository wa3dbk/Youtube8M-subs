application<00:01:12.500> it<00:01:13.500> was<00:01:13.680> a<00:01:13.710> bit<00:01:14.159> hard<00:01:14.189> at<00:01:14.760> first<00:01:15.090> I

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
application it was a bit hard at first I

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.270 
application it was a bit hard at first I
have<00:01:15.720> to<00:01:15.750> like<00:01:16.020> take<00:01:16.619> nail<00:01:16.890> polish<00:01:17.250> remover

have to like take nail polish remover

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.520 
have to like take nail polish remover
and<00:01:17.670> wipe<00:01:18.240> it<00:01:18.360> off<00:01:18.540> a<00:01:18.840> couple<00:01:19.229> of<00:01:19.409> times

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
and wipe it off a couple of times

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.660 
and wipe it off a couple of times
because<00:01:19.880> it<00:01:20.880> gets<00:01:21.210> really<00:01:21.540> clunky<00:01:22.460> clumpy<00:01:23.460> um

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
because it gets really clunky clumpy um

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.410 
because it gets really clunky clumpy um
if<00:01:24.360> that's<00:01:25.170> not<00:01:25.320> what<00:01:25.470> I'm<00:01:25.590> looking<00:01:25.619> for<00:01:26.040> um

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:26.420 
if that's not what I'm looking for um

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.050 
if that's not what I'm looking for um
whatever<00:01:27.420> I<00:01:27.869> guess<00:01:28.200> really<00:01:28.470> like<00:01:28.680> like<00:01:29.460> yeah

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
whatever I guess really like like yeah

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.719 
whatever I guess really like like yeah
whatever<00:01:30.650> because<00:01:31.650> it's<00:01:31.829> really<00:01:32.040> thick<00:01:32.520> when

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
whatever because it's really thick when

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.090 
whatever because it's really thick when
it<00:01:32.850> dries<00:01:33.119> but<00:01:33.509> then<00:01:33.689> when<00:01:33.900> you<00:01:33.930> like<00:01:34.229> put<00:01:34.979> it

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
it dries but then when you like put it

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.550 
it dries but then when you like put it
on<00:01:35.250> just<00:01:35.850> like<00:01:35.970> put<00:01:36.420> it<00:01:36.540> on<00:01:36.659> at<00:01:36.900> first<00:01:37.110> really

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
on just like put it on at first really

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.289 
on just like put it on at first really
thin<00:01:37.979> it<00:01:38.130> so<00:01:38.250> i<00:01:38.310> had<00:01:38.460> to<00:01:38.549> put<00:01:38.670> like<00:01:39.030> three

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
thin it so i had to put like three

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.749 
thin it so i had to put like three
layers<00:01:39.600> on<00:01:39.930> two<00:01:40.500> or<00:01:40.650> three<00:01:40.890> layers<00:01:41.100> on<00:01:41.369> because

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
layers on two or three layers on because

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.539 
layers on two or three layers on because
it<00:01:41.880> was<00:01:42.030> so<00:01:42.210> thin<00:01:42.450> and<00:01:42.479> it<00:01:43.049> was<00:01:43.200> to<00:01:43.409> clear<00:01:44.189> and

stuff and like yeah so that was kind of
irritating<00:01:48.270> like<00:01:48.420> applying<00:01:49.079> it<00:01:49.380> because<00:01:49.979> it

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
irritating like applying it because it

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.270 
irritating like applying it because it
was<00:01:50.810> like<00:01:51.810> not<00:01:52.049> as<00:01:52.229> easy<00:01:52.470> as<00:01:52.649> normal<00:01:53.130> nail
