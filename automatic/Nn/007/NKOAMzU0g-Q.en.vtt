00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
Deere yellow that was on there we had

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.510 
Deere yellow that was on there we had
nine<00:01:32.790> our<00:01:33.030> 22s<00:01:33.570> and<00:01:33.659> a<00:01:33.750> half<00:01:33.979> an<00:01:34.979> hour<00:01:35.280> twenty

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
nine our 22s and a half an hour twenty

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.010 
nine our 22s and a half an hour twenty
two<00:01:35.610> and<00:01:35.729> a<00:01:35.790> half<00:01:35.909> tires<00:01:36.180> on<00:01:36.360> it<00:01:36.450> before<00:01:36.810> these

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
two and a half tires on it before these

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.140

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
are actually 10 R 22 and a half so

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.880 
are actually 10 R 22 and a half so
they're<00:01:39.299> wider<00:01:39.630> more<00:01:40.259> importantly<00:01:40.680> they're

they're wider more importantly they're

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.399 
they're wider more importantly they're
also<00:01:41.070> taller<00:01:41.700> so<00:01:42.420> it<00:01:42.570> kind<00:01:42.750> of<00:01:42.810> a<00:01:42.990> hillbilly
