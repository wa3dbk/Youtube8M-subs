interesting about this is it does have

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:31.970 
interesting about this is it does have
two<00:00:30.630> cores<00:00:30.960> with<00:00:31.170> hyper-threading<00:00:31.470> so<00:00:31.859> we're

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
two cores with hyper-threading so we're

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.639 
two cores with hyper-threading so we're
seeing<00:00:32.099> that<00:00:32.250> the<00:00:32.399> 444<00:00:33.300> is<00:00:33.420> here<00:00:33.660> but<00:00:34.200> what<00:00:34.350> I

Windows performance on this tablet is
actually<00:00:52.980> really<00:00:53.129> interesting<00:00:53.640> so<00:00:53.760> I'm<00:00:53.910> going

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:05.910 
like this will get up to about 36 37 38

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:08.180 
like this will get up to about 36 37 38
degrees<00:02:06.450> which<00:02:06.990> by<00:02:07.290> a<00:02:07.320> lot<00:02:07.710> of<00:02:07.860> companies

standards like HP would be a fail so the

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:11.870 
standards like HP would be a fail so the
fact<00:02:11.160> that<00:02:11.190> they<00:02:11.340> have<00:02:11.490> this<00:02:11.670> on

heater<00:02:41.800> trail<00:02:42.010> is<00:02:42.100> perfectly<00:02:42.400> capable<00:02:42.610> of

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
heater trail is perfectly capable of

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:46.560 
heater trail is perfectly capable of
1080p<00:02:43.090> output<00:02:43.600> and<00:02:44.260> play<00:02:45.220> so<00:02:45.880> around<00:02:46.210> the<00:02:46.330> top

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:46.570 
1080p output and play so around the top

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:49.350 
1080p output and play so around the top
there<00:02:46.960> is<00:02:46.990> the<00:02:47.410> power<00:02:47.920> button<00:02:48.160> and<00:02:48.460> this

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:49.360 
there is the power button and this

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.330 
there is the power button and this
actually<00:02:49.540> does<00:02:49.900> support<00:02:50.290> Intel's<00:02:50.800> wide<00:02:51.160> eyes

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
actually does support Intel's wide eyes

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:52.800 
actually does support Intel's wide eyes
so<00:02:51.640> you<00:02:51.730> could<00:02:51.880> actually<00:02:52.000> use<00:02:52.180> this<00:02:52.390> at<00:02:52.570> home

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
so you could actually use this at home

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:55.470 
so you could actually use this at home
to<00:02:53.650> stream<00:02:54.280> wirelessly<00:02:54.460> to<00:02:55.060> your<00:02:55.090> television

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
to stream wirelessly to your television

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.630 
to stream wirelessly to your television
so<00:02:56.260> if<00:02:56.440> you<00:02:56.590> were<00:02:56.740> you<00:02:56.920> know<00:02:57.010> tripping<00:02:57.550> out

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640 
so if you were you know tripping out

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.070 
so if you were you know tripping out
whatever<00:02:57.790> you<00:02:58.000> can<00:02:58.090> actually<00:02:58.240> see<00:02:58.420> mr.<00:02:58.780> to<00:02:58.960> be

00:02:59.070 --> 00:02:59.080 
whatever you can actually see mr. to be

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:00.870 
whatever you can actually see mr. to be

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:00.880 
that they've had a Wi-Fi receiver so

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:03.210 
that they've had a Wi-Fi receiver so

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
this would look at Emma sighs wimp at

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:05.760 
this would look at Emma sighs wimp at
120<00:03:03.820> w<00:03:04.180> this<00:03:04.570> is<00:03:04.690> a<00:03:04.750> great<00:03:04.990> improvement<00:03:05.290> of

and this fan is actually blowing quite
hot<00:03:17.920> air<00:03:18.130> this<00:03:18.610> is<00:03:18.730> a<00:03:18.760> real<00:03:19.000> problem<00:03:19.270> with

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:19.540 
hot air this is a real problem with

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:21.480 
hot air this is a real problem with
Windows<00:03:19.870> tablets<00:03:20.350> especially<00:03:21.130> on<00:03:21.190> the<00:03:21.250> cedar

poorly designed it actually becomes a

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:27.240 
poorly designed it actually becomes a
huge<00:03:25.120> issue<00:03:25.210> if<00:03:25.870> I<00:03:25.990> go<00:03:26.140> like<00:03:26.170> this<00:03:26.500> and<00:03:26.770> then

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250 
huge issue if I go like this and then

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:28.530 
huge issue if I go like this and then
there's<00:03:27.400> just<00:03:27.550> hot<00:03:27.700> air<00:03:27.730> blowing<00:03:28.000> on<00:03:28.210> my<00:03:28.330> hand
