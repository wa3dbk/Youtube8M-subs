00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:09.950
 For five years, the institution has been unparalleled in Germany 

00:00:11.149 --> 00:00:14.149
 the high level continues 

00:00:18.749 --> 00:00:22.349
 I'm going to pose for a nice trillion and the new semester soon 

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:22.869
 starts 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:26.839
 By the occasion marriages and structural use of the first semester use the ruhr-uni 

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:28.300
 Bochum 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:31.300
 the long-term student 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.590
 SMS what it really means Forlan the UVS and 30 on the campus of the university 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:50.060
 Although there are already 2600 students or students who are politically correct 

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:52.090
 but linguistically 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:55.640
 In addition, about 5,000 employees work in empty technology and administration 

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:00.660
 At the University of Essen about half as many people on the way as Dinslaken 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.850
 Inhabitants and that makes them one of the ten largest colleges 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.850
 Germany 

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:31.730
 Pomeranian 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.710
 The University Bochum was the first university new customers in the 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:38.170
 Federal Republic after the Second World War 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:41.720
 As the first university in the Ruhr area, she was supposed to be an employee of children 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.720
 to give the region access to education 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.800
 most buildings are just over 40 years old like the universities themselves 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.800
 and you can see that too 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.990
 At the RUB one is particularly shortcut is thrilled 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.340
 the resort center east is just as accent upper edge 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.780
 Incidentally, Centrum West South or North does not exist 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.119
 It's the first thing you see as a student of Uli because you can find them here 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:08.869
 Enrollment instead 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:11.119
 also the big introductory event in the first one 

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:13.959
 Semesters are traditionally held here 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:15.729
 so I remember with percent 

00:02:15.729 --> 00:02:19.719
 Infrequently, I shuddered at the introduction to the media and 

00:02:19.719 --> 00:02:22.719
 Pittis Tree of the English Language 

00:02:26.429 --> 00:02:29.429
 The Dome already has ten lecture halls 

00:02:29.429 --> 00:02:32.789
 In some areas it is difficult to bind oneself rightly 

00:02:32.789 --> 00:02:35.789
 this is just one of thirteen main buildings on campus 

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:40.949
 I need someone who explains the university to me and have him with Jens Wilke ob 

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:43.019
 luckily also found from the press site 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:46.319
 what do you believe me a successful first semester in vain 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:47.729
 October to the world 

00:02:47.729 --> 00:02:50.729
 Eminem bow 

00:02:52.889 --> 00:02:55.049
 GB CF 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:57.329
 be the 516 agreement 

00:02:57.329 --> 00:03:00.719
 the PCs with the help of the track continue to roll from 2 

00:03:02.619 --> 00:03:05.619
 because percent that's harder here than me 

00:03:06.469 --> 00:03:08.559
 the building could do that 

00:03:08.559 --> 00:03:12.359
 Praxen mirrors are that is the words in southern Carinthia but there will be 

00:03:13.499 --> 00:03:16.079
 Lindau are upside down 

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:19.540
 the Irish the stairs between the buildings are so-called nachbaut 

00:03:20.649 --> 00:03:22.209
 that is difficult 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:24.249
 I would say that will be fine 

00:03:24.249 --> 00:03:27.609
 firstly, may be 

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:30.609
 The university is really ugly than others 

00:03:33.899 --> 00:03:36.899
 Of course it is also the result of that garbage 

00:03:38.359 --> 00:03:40.629
 So died in other parts of the city are there 

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:43.429
 or better said in other cities 

00:03:43.429 --> 00:03:45.159
 Locations 

00:03:45.159 --> 00:03:47.099
 he is distributed and bind 

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:50.099
 there is easy fall for individual trees 

00:03:53.389 --> 00:03:56.819
 but not only the amount has the image of Ronny all over the country 

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:58.719
 worldwide 

00:03:58.719 --> 00:04:01.900
 just one thing is always addressed if you are safe troop 

00:04:01.899 --> 00:04:03.699
 Student recognizes 

00:04:03.699 --> 00:04:07.859
 Bochum that's not the political suicide rate among students 

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:11.650
 They have 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:14.849
 This story is once and for all out of the world to clear it up 

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:15.969
 statistically nonsense 

00:04:15.969 --> 00:04:18.969
 what was there 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:22.729
 and percent through walls 

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:25.409
 become necessary 

00:04:25.409 --> 00:04:28.550
 because I look at the media 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:31.550
 stood in the life 

00:04:32.219 --> 00:04:35.400
 it is I am myself since 19 92 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:38.400
 just like one 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:42.430
 so as I said, statistically it is not at all 

00:04:47.379 --> 00:04:50.379
 There are other things the university should be reason for 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:54.930
 What are the structural defects? It certainly becomes a real one over time 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:57.930
 Trademark developed 

00:04:59.349 --> 00:05:02.349
 a drunk on the Bundesplatz details 

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:03.919
 the University of Berlin 

00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:06.919
 something of the whole parasols 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:08.990
 that is of course already 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:11.050
 Mixa is one day long 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:13.039
 here is percent 

00:05:13.039 --> 00:05:16.039
 I assume that zu Guttenberg here 

00:05:17.699 --> 00:05:20.699
 rehabilitated 

00:05:21.219 --> 00:05:24.219
 Preliminary work 

00:05:25.469 --> 00:05:28.469
 in the course of this 

00:05:35.699 --> 00:05:37.789
 You can not make any sense here 

00:05:37.789 --> 00:05:40.789
 The word has been forbidden 

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:45.150
 yes and then there was something else inhabited for the Uyghurs 

00:05:45.969 --> 00:05:49.339
 she was one of the first colleges in Germany to consistently adapt to the new 

00:05:49.339 --> 00:05:52.029
 Bachelor's degree 

00:05:52.029 --> 00:05:55.239
 This scholastic study comes especially lazy students themselves 

00:05:55.239 --> 00:05:57.309
 can not finally get up against it 

00:05:57.309 --> 00:05:58.180
 so me 

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:01.180
 as far as the former Netherlands are the graduates should 

00:06:02.129 --> 00:06:05.610
 especially the numbers would be overwhelming 

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:07.520
 complete her studies 

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:10.520
 at least at the coffers 

00:06:12.169 --> 00:06:13.569
 Consequently 

00:06:13.569 --> 00:06:16.419
 the number of dropouts 

00:06:16.419 --> 00:06:17.770
 Trulli message 

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:19.809
 read how it works for
