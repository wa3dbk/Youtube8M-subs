you<00:00:53.430> can<00:00:53.579> see<00:00:53.790> this<00:00:54.350> when<00:00:55.350> I<00:00:55.379> put<00:00:55.920> the<00:00:56.040> pipe

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
you can see this when I put the pipe

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.959 
you can see this when I put the pipe
cleaners<00:00:56.640> in<00:00:56.820> and<00:00:57.270> I<00:00:57.690> bent<00:00:58.110> it<00:00:58.520> at<00:00:59.520> the<00:00:59.760> root

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
cleaners in and I bent it at the root

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.759 
cleaners in and I bent it at the root
like<00:01:00.480> this<00:01:00.780> I<00:01:01.579> just<00:01:02.579> put<00:01:03.120> that<00:01:03.360> around<00:01:03.600> my<00:01:04.440> hair

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
like this I just put that around my hair

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.050 
like this I just put that around my hair
and<00:01:05.240> started<00:01:06.240> wrapping<00:01:06.780> I<00:01:07.020> did<00:01:07.530> not<00:01:07.790> twist<00:01:08.790> it

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
and started wrapping I did not twist it

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.350 
and started wrapping I did not twist it
I<00:01:09.780> noticed<00:01:10.500> in<00:01:10.619> her<00:01:10.740> video<00:01:11.040> after<00:01:11.940> she<00:01:12.119> meant

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
I noticed in her video after she meant

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.649 
I noticed in her video after she meant
it<00:01:12.510> in<00:01:12.630> half<00:01:12.869> she<00:01:13.470> then<00:01:13.710> twisted<00:01:14.340> it<00:01:14.490> I<00:01:14.760> did<00:01:15.450> not

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
it in half she then twisted it I did not

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.020 
it in half she then twisted it I did not
do<00:01:15.869> that<00:01:15.900> so<00:01:16.320> I<00:01:16.710> think<00:01:16.890> that<00:01:17.280> might<00:01:17.610> have<00:01:17.760> made

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
do that so I think that might have made

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.179 
do that so I think that might have made
the<00:01:18.720> removal<00:01:19.229> process<00:01:19.409> a<00:01:19.650> little<00:01:20.010> more

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
the removal process a little more

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.820 
the removal process a little more
difficult<00:01:20.850> it<00:01:21.450> didn't<00:01:21.750> take<00:01:21.900> me<00:01:22.110> nearly<00:01:22.740> an

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
difficult it didn't take me nearly an

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.280 
difficult it didn't take me nearly an
hour<00:01:23.010> to<00:01:23.250> remove<00:01:23.700> my<00:01:23.880> pipe<00:01:24.119> cleaners<00:01:24.510> it<00:01:25.140> took

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
hour to remove my pipe cleaners it took

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.039 
hour to remove my pipe cleaners it took
me<00:01:25.470> more<00:01:25.590> like<00:01:25.890> 20<00:01:26.369> minutes<00:01:26.610> I'd<00:01:26.909> say<00:01:27.210> in<00:01:27.869> my

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
me more like 20 minutes I'd say in my

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:32.870 
me more like 20 minutes I'd say in my
video<00:01:28.320> if<00:01:28.470> you<00:01:28.590> noticed<00:01:29.040> I<00:01:29.340> am<00:01:31.880> basically

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
video if you noticed I am basically

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.030 
video if you noticed I am basically
where<00:01:33.210> I<00:01:33.240> had<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:33.600> hair<00:01:33.810> tightly<00:01:34.350> at<00:01:34.680> the<00:01:34.830> root

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
where I had the hair tightly at the root

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.359 
where I had the hair tightly at the root
I<00:01:35.689> tried<00:01:36.689> to<00:01:36.900> push<00:01:37.170> that<00:01:37.200> down<00:01:37.470> a<00:01:37.770> little<00:01:38.130> bit

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
I tried to push that down a little bit

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.719 
I tried to push that down a little bit
and<00:01:38.580> then<00:01:39.210> have<00:01:39.600> the<00:01:40.320> bent<00:01:40.619> part<00:01:40.860> exposed<00:01:41.460> so<00:01:41.700> I

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
and then have the bent part exposed so I

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.030 
and then have the bent part exposed so I
could<00:01:42.030> just<00:01:42.240> lift<00:01:42.479> it<00:01:42.659> up<00:01:42.829> straighten<00:01:43.829> it<00:01:43.950> out

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
could just lift it up straighten it out

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.950 
could just lift it up straighten it out
and<00:01:44.280> then<00:01:44.490> pull<00:01:44.790> the<00:01:44.939> pipe<00:01:45.119> cleaner<00:01:45.420> out<00:01:45.630> I

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
and then pull the pipe cleaner out I

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.050 
and then pull the pipe cleaner out I
hope<00:01:46.320> that's<00:01:46.590> making<00:01:46.920> sense<00:01:46.950> if<00:01:47.430> not<00:01:47.670> when<00:01:47.909> I'm

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
hope that's making sense if not when I'm

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.230 
hope that's making sense if not when I'm
able<00:01:48.299> to<00:01:48.770> record<00:01:49.770> a<00:01:49.799> video<00:01:49.950> with<00:01:50.400> using<00:01:51.060> both
