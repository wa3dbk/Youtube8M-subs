00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.350
 welcome here maths then small video 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.170
 fast where I'm going to tell you what I 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:09.660
 think of muscu training for everything 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.920
 what is combat complement and after that 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.469
 I have to do a little training 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.880
 good it rained but it's nice when 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.680
 even huh and then I prefer to train 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.910
 and out there rather than going into a 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.650
 room of times it's true that there are 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.939
 rooms that have great atmosphere and 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.039
 as many times there are others 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.480
 we know that's a bit oppressive 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.430
 it's a little boring same defects at 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.720
 sound level me it happened to me 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.000
 take big good times 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.380
 musical suppository but stuff to 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.149
 make you want to stop everything 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.040
 to enter your house so there at least 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.020
 it's quiet we hear the birds 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.930
 and everything and I'll go do this to me 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:42.210
 after then yes so for them for them 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.160
 muscu complements for the fight then 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.329
 there are several tips on hearing time 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.739
 that there are people who think that 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:50.820
 it slowed down we get massive after that 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:52.649
 consumes much higher level of 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.260
 oxygen since we have more mass a 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.370
 harmed cardio all that and well we go 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.020
 actually it's true that if we 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.109
 train in a in an optics 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:04.439
 mass gain hypertrophy here rather 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:06.659
 bodybuilding and ben fatally we're going 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.610
 consume more oxygen and that's okay 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:12.479
 to be a little misery and that too 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.799
 trend it's true to slow down it's 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.119
 for that I think it's 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.820
 much better to direct the training 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:20.310
 on everything that is power force and 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.869
 even pliometry obviously and what 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.479
 does that you're going to develop rather 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.490
 of things so it's already at the level 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:29.220
 nervous so you do not necessarily 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.650
 to take more mass but especially it goes 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.350
 train yourself to explosive 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:35.490
 explosiveness so that's something that is 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:39.210
 in combat is to arrive at 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.200
 send a good a flow of energy water 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.150
 at the right time to surpass 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.830
 the opponent and working in 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.960
 force low power that teaches you 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:47.670
 just to do that you get used to 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.310
 even unconsciously after when you 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.530
 go stuck doing a defense on a 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:56.310
 on a projection anything at 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.690
 level of the posture of impulse 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.149
 energetic it's not going to be the same thing 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:02.009
 is that good I 'm going to check a lot of 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:04.200
 time when I when I started to 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:05.700
 make power force sites after 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.190
 combat training it was 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.380
 not at all the same after there is a 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.120
 second thing is that by working on 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:15.209
 basic exercises 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:18.720
 in this I think especially of all that 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:20.850
 is squat drifts the exercise a little bit 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.980
 of two postures the Olympic movement 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:24.090
 which also requires a good speed there 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.300
 you will work in a muscular chain 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.830
 it's a posture force and have a 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:30.930
 good posture well powerful well 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:33.090
 explosive too when you when you 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.610
 send impulses on the legs or 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.090
 what is it in combat that gives a big 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.040
 advantage 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.630
 there is a huge difference between a guy 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.430
 who bump and exercises peace a guy 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:43.170
 that it is beautiful this not so here after 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.810
 so you do not have to go there either 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:48.780
 two hours a day 30 minutes 40 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:51.030
 minutes per day or per session that's enough 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.709
 good for developing a good influx 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:55.140
 nervous and good postures and one 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:57.570
 especially not on a training 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:58.890
 of bodybuilding weight gain or 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:00.780
 so we're really going to make 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:02.460
 insulation movements to work such 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:06.240
 deltoid segment 

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:07.830
 doubs where the head of the biceps that we want 

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:10.800
 by orienting the arm more or less 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:14.400
 that we do not care it's not our thing 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:16.830
 so it's mostly used to develop 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:20.040
 the nerve impulse so work power 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:22.380
 force by working out exercises of two 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.980
 postures and also think about the 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:24.510
 pluviometry 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.400
 there is also a big difference when 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:29.010
 we work in hypertrophy knows we're going 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:32.520
 have a slow tempo we will push 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:35.310
 slowly after we brake and that kind of 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:38.040
 tempo finally it does not help 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:40.410
 explosiveness and that tends to you 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:43.590
 get used to being slow also eventually 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:46.560
 so that's why it's better 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:49.140
 work in power in coulon on 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:50.910
 happens we send a big impulse and 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:51.990
 the goal is to lift with a tempo 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:53.460
 the shortest possible 

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:55.680
 that's it for me that's how it's needed 

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:57.660
 guide the training if you work in 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:59.850
 in order to complement each other and to 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:01.410
 level of martial arts all that go 

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:03.660
 take a tour on the site click on the 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:06.060
 link and register there you will receive 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:08.010
 videos that goes into more detail of 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:09.540
 all these notions of parameters 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:11.400
 different training to plan 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:14.010
 your programs all at what tempo 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:16.260
 use and all and on the site so 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:18.000
 I hope it will help you is beautiful 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:21.020
 well and I'll talk to you again in the 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.020
 next video has more
