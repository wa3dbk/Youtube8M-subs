00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:57.760 
understanding of the overall speed

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.150 
understanding of the overall speed
increase<00:00:58.329> on<00:00:58.630> the<00:00:58.660> 4s<00:00:59.200> as<00:00:59.500> opposed<00:00:59.890> to<00:01:00.040> the

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:00.160

price difference in between the two is

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:10.260 
price difference in between the two is
only<00:01:07.780> a<00:01:07.899> hundred<00:01:08.079> bucks<00:01:08.200> so<00:01:09.040> my<00:01:09.850> personal

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:41.700 
let's go ahead and get out of our safari
what<00:02:39.460> else<00:02:39.670> can<00:02:40.030> we<00:02:40.300> run<00:02:40.720> how<00:02:41.320> about<00:02:41.470> the<00:02:41.560> App

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:41.710 
what else can we run how about the App

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:43.380 
what else can we run how about the App
Store<00:02:41.740> we'll<00:02:42.310> see<00:02:42.520> which<00:02:42.670> one<00:02:42.880> populates

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390 
Store we'll see which one populates

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:51.060 
Store we'll see which one populates
faster<00:02:43.840> as<00:02:43.960> far<00:02:44.140> as<00:02:44.230> the<00:02:44.320> app<00:02:44.440> store<00:02:48.480> and<00:02:50.070> the

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:51.070 
faster as far as the app store and the

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:53.820 
faster as far as the app store and the
4s<00:02:51.370> is<00:02:51.550> done<00:02:51.760> and<00:02:52.150> the<00:02:52.210> iphone<00:02:52.840> 4<00:02:53.350> just<00:02:53.650> caught

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:53.830 
4s is done and the iphone 4 just caught

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:59.850 
4s is done and the iphone 4 just caught
up<00:02:55.950> so<00:02:56.950> that's<00:02:57.130> it<00:02:57.370> with<00:02:57.580> that<00:02:57.820> and<00:02:58.750> one<00:02:59.650> more

00:02:59.850 --> 00:02:59.860 
up so that's it with that and one more

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:03.240 
up so that's it with that and one more
let's<00:03:00.100> say<00:03:00.250> we'll<00:03:01.150> go<00:03:01.270> to<00:03:01.330> the<00:03:01.590> calendar<00:03:02.590> just

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
let's say we'll go to the calendar just

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:07.230 
let's say we'll go to the calendar just
for<00:03:03.460> the<00:03:03.550> heck<00:03:03.670> of<00:03:03.790> it<00:03:04.560> and<00:03:05.560> the<00:03:06.220> 4s<00:03:06.610> once<00:03:06.970> again

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:07.240 
for the heck of it and the 4s once again

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:10.200 
for the heck of it and the 4s once again
load<00:03:07.720> it<00:03:07.870> up<00:03:07.960> faster<00:03:08.470> so<00:03:09.250> that's<00:03:09.400> it<00:03:09.580> guys<00:03:09.610> just

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:10.210 
load it up faster so that's it guys just

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:13.110 
load it up faster so that's it guys just
basically<00:03:10.990> really<00:03:11.740> brief<00:03:11.980> quick<00:03:12.640> to<00:03:13.090> the

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
basically really brief quick to the

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.420 
basically really brief quick to the
point<00:03:13.390> video<00:03:13.890> showing<00:03:14.890> you<00:03:15.070> the<00:03:15.220> speed

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
point video showing you the speed

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:19.410 
point video showing you the speed
differences<00:03:16.020> so<00:03:17.020> as<00:03:17.260> you<00:03:17.290> have<00:03:17.740> seen<00:03:18.030> the<00:03:19.030> 4s

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:19.420 
differences so as you have seen the 4s

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:23.160 
differences so as you have seen the 4s
is<00:03:19.690> definitely<00:03:20.820> much<00:03:21.820> much<00:03:22.150> faster<00:03:22.360> than<00:03:22.900> the

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:23.170 
is definitely much much faster than the

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:26.520 
is definitely much much faster than the
four<00:03:23.490> so<00:03:24.490> hopefully<00:03:25.420> this<00:03:25.570> guy<00:03:25.810> this<00:03:26.230> helps

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.530 
four so hopefully this guy this helps

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:29.610 
four so hopefully this guy this helps
