10 for design the reason that would lose

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.609 
10 for design the reason that would lose
a<00:01:42.000> few<00:01:42.270> marks<00:01:42.509> with<00:01:42.630> me<00:01:42.780> is<00:01:42.990> because<00:01:43.170> the

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
a few marks with me is because the

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.530 
a few marks with me is because the
picture<00:01:43.920> shown<00:01:44.280> on<00:01:44.399> the<00:01:44.490> front<00:01:44.759> is<00:01:44.909> not<00:01:45.390> an

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
accurate figure representation there are

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:49.999 
accurate figure representation there are
two<00:01:48.420> things<00:01:48.450> that<00:01:48.810> lead<00:01:49.110> me<00:01:49.140> to<00:01:49.380> this<00:01:49.500> the

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
two things that lead me to this the

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.560 
two things that lead me to this the
first<00:01:50.310> is<00:01:50.520> that<00:01:50.579> it<00:01:50.820> shows<00:01:51.000> that<00:01:51.119> his<00:01:51.299> hands

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
first is that it shows that his hands

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.690 
first is that it shows that his hands
will<00:01:51.720> be<00:01:51.750> clenched<00:01:52.229> in<00:01:52.380> fists<00:01:52.950> but<00:01:53.399> on<00:01:53.549> the

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
will be clenched in fists but on the

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.330 
will be clenched in fists but on the
actual<00:01:54.030> figure<00:01:54.479> they<00:01:54.810> are<00:01:54.869> open<00:01:55.320> the<00:01:55.920> second

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
actual figure they are open the second

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.069 
actual figure they are open the second
is<00:01:56.460> that<00:01:56.490> underneath<00:01:56.909> his<00:01:57.210> eye<00:01:57.360> is<00:01:57.719> supposed

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
is that underneath his eye is supposed

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.080 
is that underneath his eye is supposed
to<00:01:58.229> be<00:01:58.380> brighter<00:01:58.680> green<00:01:58.890> dots<00:01:59.219> but<00:01:59.820> on<00:01:59.969> the

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
to be brighter green dots but on the

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.179 
to be brighter green dots but on the
figure<00:02:00.299> underneath<00:02:00.869> is<00:02:00.990> I<00:02:01.110> it<00:02:01.469> is<00:02:01.740> one<00:02:01.950> solid

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
figure underneath is I it is one solid

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.670 
figure underneath is I it is one solid
color<00:02:02.600> because<00:02:03.600> of<00:02:03.719> this<00:02:03.810> misprint<00:02:04.350> a<00:02:04.469> leads

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
color because of this misprint a leads

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.130 
color because of this misprint a leads
me<00:02:04.799> to<00:02:05.250> deduct<00:02:06.000> a<00:02:06.149> few<00:02:06.390> marks<00:02:06.689> off<00:02:06.840> of<00:02:06.869> the

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
me to deduct a few marks off of the

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.350 
me to deduct a few marks off of the
overall<00:02:07.469> rating<00:02:08.009> another<00:02:08.670> example<00:02:08.819> of<00:02:09.119> this

that I cannot show you fully today but

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:12.720 
that I cannot show you fully today but
an<00:02:12.030> example

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
an example

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.119 
an example
is<00:02:12.819> that<00:02:13.300> on<00:02:13.480> the<00:02:13.510> picture<00:02:14.110> of<00:02:14.409> maleficents

00:02:15.119 --> 00:02:15.129 
is that on the picture of maleficents

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:16.920 
is that on the picture of maleficents
figure<00:02:15.489> it<00:02:15.730> shows<00:02:16.209> that<00:02:16.330> her<00:02:16.450> scepter<00:02:16.810> will

figure it shows that her scepter will

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:19.050 
figure it shows that her scepter will
have<00:02:17.110> a<00:02:17.140> red<00:02:17.470> ball<00:02:17.769> on<00:02:17.980> the<00:02:18.099> top<00:02:18.310> but<00:02:18.819> on<00:02:18.940> her

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
have a red ball on the top but on her

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.600 
have a red ball on the top but on her
figure<00:02:19.540> it<00:02:19.720> is<00:02:19.840> a<00:02:19.870> green<00:02:20.260> ball<00:02:20.530> these<00:02:21.310> aren't

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
figure it is a green ball these aren't

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:23.850 
figure it is a green ball these aren't
huge<00:02:22.150> differences<00:02:22.750> but<00:02:23.080> that<00:02:23.290> is<00:02:23.440> why<00:02:23.650> they

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
huge differences but that is why they

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:26.190 
huge differences but that is why they
lost<00:02:24.040> a<00:02:24.250> few<00:02:24.430> marks<00:02:24.790> when<00:02:25.030> I<00:02:25.060> came<00:02:25.180> to<00:02:25.599> rating

lost a few marks when I came to rating

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.039 
lost a few marks when I came to rating
it<00:02:26.319> now<00:02:26.920> i<00:02:26.950> will<00:02:27.459> review<00:02:27.580> the<00:02:27.849> figure<00:02:28.209> i<00:02:28.420> find
