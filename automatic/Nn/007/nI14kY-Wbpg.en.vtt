00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240
 if money is not a big problem and 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.279
 they tell us to choose a saloon 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.109
 sports representation we will think 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:09.719
 in the porsche panamera the audi a7 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:12.059
 sportback the bmw series 6 jean coupÃ© or the 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.860
 Mercedes Cls if they tell us to think 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.949
 in a familiar car our mind 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.760
 Next review audi a6 avant bmw series 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.310
 5 family 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.830
 mercedes straight class and if they tell us 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.730
 that we mix both concepts 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:25.949
 surely our head to the 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.480
 short and we will need 10 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.689
 downloads of an automatic defibrillator 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.890
 but in mercedes or have disheveled 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:33.989
 they are changing the world of the automobile 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.250
 with new types of cars and the cls 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.860
 shooting brake that brings more to your 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.750
 screen is a clear example we are 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.940
 before a model of almost 5 meters long 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.440
 and the best part is that there is more height 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.570
 free of the roof and more width in the 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.969
 rear seats that in the cls model of the 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.860
 which drift and series has three seats 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.320
 back though it's better than to travel 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.879
 comfortably go and go for only two 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.620
 front that with the optional equipment 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.780
 that mounts the car that you are seeing 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.699
 has a nine-figure invoice for 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.199
 that's no wonder it's meant 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.039
 to all those who arrive baggy to 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:02.560
 End of the month 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.660
 and that 

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:06.460
 they like to take a different car with 

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:08.740
 sports dyes and do not want to give up 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:10.660
 to the practicality of the tailgate nor to 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:12.910
 load comfortably in the trunk the 

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:14.290
 golf clubs or polo kit or 

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:16.780
 all those sports that practice 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:18.820
 elite and that they have little to do with 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:21.410
 Swimming that only requires a swimsuit 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:24.150
 and it fits anywhere 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:25.830
 and they can also do it with the floor 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.110
 of the trunk lined with cherry wood 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.640
 American is a warm wood and 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.680
 malleable that is used to make 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.170
 music instruments and that by the way 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.090
 It occurs mainly in Europe and Asia and 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.400
 to carry a cello by trunk 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.950
 we have to pay the chilling figure of 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.650
 four thousand euros and above is grated with 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.720
 look at it and it's that finite nothing to see 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:47.369
 with 19th century carriages that 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.840
 used to carry the weapons and of 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.210
 those who derive the name shooting brake 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.800
 the trunk is quite capable but the 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.770
 body design takes up space 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:57.630
 and it stays at 590 liters that although not 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.060
 it's not bad they are 100 liters less than 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.950
 the family class at least the gate 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.890
 of the trunk has opening and closing 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.360
 series electric is something very comfortable 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.009
 since we only have to press a button 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.899
 to act 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.360
 but it's not standard and we think that 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:14.700
 it should be the opening of the car and the 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:17.610
 Engine start without key starting 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:19.680
 this car costs almost 77 thousand euros and does not 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:22.019
 happy with it they make us pay about 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.150
 thousand euros more for this extra so 

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:25.950
 less get the thorn offering 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.010
 also standard rear suspension 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.959
 pneumatic self-leveling 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:31.730
 in this way even though we take 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:33.709
 backwards everything necessary for the 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.480
 practice of our favorite sport in 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:38.000
 the car stays flat improving the 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:40.120
 stability of your new food and a lot 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.650
 less but it is appreciated that it is standard 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:44.420
 if we want to take another step we can 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:46.310
 ride suspension options 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:48.500
 pneumatic on both trains with modes of 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:50.420
 Comfort operation and sport what 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:53.060
 united to the softness and silence of march 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:54.890
 of its v6 engine of 3 and a half liters and 306 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:57.409
 horses to travel in this car 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:59.090
 to do it at another level and that is 

00:02:57.409 --> 00:03:01.150
 put at your command is a true 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:03.470
 pleasure whatever the road or place 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:05.569
 has some armchairs that hold the 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:07.340
 body better than the home chairs and 

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:09.560
 for 1200 euros we can put them 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:11.420
 ventilation is not for being fussy 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:13.609
 but I think after paying that 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:15.019
 amount the least we can demand of them 

00:03:13.609 --> 00:03:17.629
 is that the ventilated and cough are 

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:19.810
 completely silent and these do not 

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:19.810
 are 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:29.860
 the engine pushes progressively and when 

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:32.710
 we reached 4,000 revolutions per 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:34.720
 minute we notice how he takes a claw and does not let 

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:37.060
 of pushing up to 6,000 seems like a 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:39.730
 multi valves of the old ones and those 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:42.280
 300 horses we noticed them fully under 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:44.710
 the pedal in town surprises for the good 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:45.910
 that turns it looks like a utility so 

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:48.430
 the turns closed in the parking lots 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:50.920
 they will not be a problem on the road 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:52.090
 defends nimbly between curves is not 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:54.490
 that we can make mischief with him 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:56.260
 because it measures 5 meters and weighs almost 2000 

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:58.030
 kilos using aluminum in the field and 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:00.760
 doors but it's anything less 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:02.560
 clumsy and on the highway we will love it 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:04.030
 devour kilometers and when we arrive 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:08.070
 we want the holidays to end 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:08.070
 to return to make the way back 

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:17.060
 although the engine is a prodigy of 

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:19.640
 softness and its consumption with about 89 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:20.930
 Actual liters are not exorbitant 

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:23.330
 it would be too much to take a look at the 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:26.480
 diesel versions specifically to the 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:28.400
 access version of 204 horses is not 

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:31.480
 that we do not over pasta is that neither 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:31.480
 we want to squander it
