opening up more we'll do one more of
those<00:00:40.800> that<00:00:41.160> was<00:00:41.340> very<00:00:41.550> good<00:00:41.879> so<00:00:42.840> she<00:00:42.899> puts

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
those that was very good so she puts

right to left that would be one of the

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.840 
right to left that would be one of the
very<00:00:55.230> first<00:00:55.500> and<00:00:55.800> basic<00:00:56.160> things<00:00:56.190> we<00:00:56.550> can<00:00:56.730> do

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
very first and basic things we can do

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.670 
very first and basic things we can do
with<00:00:56.940> a<00:00:57.000> horse<00:00:57.300> to<00:00:57.719> help<00:00:57.930> them<00:00:58.079> understand

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
with a horse to help them understand

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.069 
with a horse to help them understand
this<00:00:58.890> concept<00:00:59.430> of<00:00:59.520> moving<00:00:59.969> side<00:01:00.809> to<00:01:00.840> side

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
this concept of moving side to side

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.650 
this concept of moving side to side
rather<00:01:01.710> than<00:01:01.890> straight<00:01:02.430> on<00:01:02.670> a<00:01:02.910> young<00:01:03.449> horse

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
rather than straight on a young horse

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.299 
rather than straight on a young horse
would<00:01:03.930> be<00:01:04.049> taught<00:01:04.260> first<00:01:04.500> to<00:01:04.739> do<00:01:04.890> straight

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
would be taught first to do straight

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.580 
would be taught first to do straight
forward<00:01:05.880> straight<00:01:06.479> on<00:01:06.720> straight<00:01:07.020> lines<00:01:07.049> round

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
forward straight on straight lines round

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.170 
forward straight on straight lines round
through<00:01:07.830> the<00:01:07.860> corners<00:01:08.340> but<00:01:08.790> then<00:01:08.970> we<00:01:09.060> would

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
through the corners but then we would

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.240 
through the corners but then we would
soon<00:01:09.360> like<00:01:09.600> to<00:01:09.750> move<00:01:09.900> them<00:01:10.110> to<00:01:10.260> this<00:01:10.680> position

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
soon like to move them to this position

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.370 
soon like to move them to this position
where<00:01:11.729> they<00:01:11.880> understand<00:01:12.510> how<00:01:12.689> to<00:01:12.750> cross<00:01:13.080> over

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
where they understand how to cross over

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.039 
where they understand how to cross over
Laura<00:01:14.310> right<00:01:14.549> now<00:01:14.729> is<00:01:14.909> starting<00:01:15.210> to<00:01:15.270> show<00:01:15.570> how

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
Laura right now is starting to show how

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.469 
Laura right now is starting to show how
he<00:01:16.110> would<00:01:16.439> then<00:01:16.590> go<00:01:16.799> to<00:01:16.860> side<00:01:17.280> passing<00:01:17.939> the

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
he would then go to side passing the

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.179 
he would then go to side passing the
difference<00:01:18.900> being<00:01:19.170> of<00:01:19.290> course<00:01:19.350> she's<00:01:19.770> asking

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
difference being of course she's asking

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.940 
difference being of course she's asking
him<00:01:20.310> to<00:01:20.490> remain<00:01:20.790> in<00:01:21.210> one<00:01:21.540> track<00:01:21.930> from<00:01:22.560> left<00:01:22.830> to

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
him to remain in one track from left to

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.090 
him to remain in one track from left to
right<00:01:23.250> as<00:01:23.759> his<00:01:24.030> legs<00:01:24.270> cross<00:01:24.600> over<00:01:25.080> keeping<00:01:25.830> him

right as his legs cross over keeping him

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
on that nice straight line we call this

on that nice straight line we call this
