00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:44.789
 behind 

00:04:44.789 --> 00:04:48.879
 meanwhile, the cost starts tactic games of the trackers 

00:04:48.879 --> 00:04:52.720

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:54.169
 to the pits 

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:58.259
 which makes the ranking behind the leading WEEKENSPIEGEL Porsche strong 

00:04:58.259 --> 00:05:01.259
 jumbled up 

00:05:05.789 --> 00:05:10.159

 canceled with the red flag 

00:05:44.469 --> 00:05:46.440
 after the accident site cleared 

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:48.689

 without a fight in the next round 

00:06:31.669 --> 00:06:35.620
