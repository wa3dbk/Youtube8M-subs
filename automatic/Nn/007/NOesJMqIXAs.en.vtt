ready<00:00:21.230> just<00:00:21.410> put<00:00:21.620> a<00:00:21.650> couple<00:00:21.860> screws<00:00:22.190> in<00:00:22.450> where

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:23.450 
ready just put a couple screws in where

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:30.460 
ready just put a couple screws in where
all<00:00:23.720> the<00:00:23.840> holes<00:00:24.020> are<00:00:28.840> give<00:00:29.840> screwdrivers

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:30.470 
all the holes are give screwdrivers

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:32.799 
all the holes are give screwdrivers
screw<00:00:30.710> them<00:00:30.800> down<00:00:31.360> and<00:00:32.360> then<00:00:32.509> you're<00:00:32.629> going<00:00:32.750> to

00:00:32.799 --> 00:00:32.809

move<00:00:32.930> on<00:00:33.140> to<00:00:33.710> the<00:00:33.800> power<00:00:33.980> supply<00:00:36.370> again<00:00:38.620> line

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:39.620 
move on to the power supply again line

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:44.170 
move on to the power supply again line
it<00:00:39.770> up<00:00:39.860> nice<00:00:40.700> and<00:00:40.730> easy<00:00:42.489> find<00:00:43.489> the<00:00:43.670> holes<00:00:43.880> where

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:44.180 
it up nice and easy find the holes where

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:52.810 
it up nice and easy find the holes where
it<00:00:44.270> goes<00:00:44.420> and<00:00:45.520> screw<00:00:46.520> it<00:00:46.579> in<00:00:51.610> next<00:00:52.610> we're<00:00:52.730> going

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:52.820 
it goes and screw it in next we're going

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:54.850 
it goes and screw it in next we're going
to<00:00:52.910> do<00:00:52.970> the<00:00:53.090> drives<00:00:53.390> back<00:00:54.290> to<00:00:54.320> for<00:00:54.770> this

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:54.860 
to do the drives back to for this

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:57.190 
to do the drives back to for this
computer<00:00:55.630> slide<00:00:56.630> them<00:00:56.780> in<00:00:56.960> the<00:00:57.170> appropriate

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:57.200 
computer slide them in the appropriate

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.860 
computer slide them in the appropriate
spot<00:00:57.950> drives<00:00:58.850> them<00:00:59.059> slide<00:00:59.360> them<00:00:59.480> back<00:00:59.630> so

00:00:59.860 --> 00:00:59.870 
spot drives them slide them back so

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:02.010 
spot drives them slide them back so
they're<00:01:00.020> flush<00:01:00.230> with<00:01:00.380> the<00:01:00.410> front<00:01:00.649> of<00:01:00.739> the<00:01:00.829> case

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:02.020 
they're flush with the front of the case

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:07.390 
they're flush with the front of the case
see<00:01:03.020> here<00:01:03.670> flush<00:01:04.670> with<00:01:04.820> the<00:01:04.850> front<00:01:05.920> and<00:01:06.920> then

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:07.400 
see here flush with the front and then

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:08.680 
see here flush with the front and then
they<00:01:07.520> line<00:01:07.700> up<00:01:07.790> with<00:01:07.909> these<00:01:08.030> holes<00:01:08.270> here<00:01:08.659> and

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:08.690 
they line up with these holes here and

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:12.850 
they line up with these holes here and
you<00:01:09.500> screw<00:01:09.770> them<00:01:09.890> in<00:01:11.560> now<00:01:12.560> you<00:01:12.620> have<00:01:12.830> a

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:12.860 
you screw them in now you have a

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:15.630 
you screw them in now you have a
motherboard<00:01:13.370> power<00:01:14.000> supply<00:01:14.479> and<00:01:14.720> two<00:01:15.020> drives

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:15.640 
motherboard power supply and two drives

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:17.289 
motherboard power supply and two drives
next<00:01:16.640> you're<00:01:16.729> going<00:01:16.820> to<00:01:16.880> want<00:01:16.940> to<00:01:17.060> mount<00:01:17.180> a

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:17.299 
next you're going to want to mount a

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:20.620 
next you're going to want to mount a
hard<00:01:17.510> drive<00:01:17.780> and<00:01:18.729> there<00:01:19.729> are<00:01:19.940> a<00:01:19.970> lot<00:01:20.240> of<00:01:20.270> spots

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:20.630 
hard drive and there are a lot of spots

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:22.450 
hard drive and there are a lot of spots
so<00:01:21.440> you<00:01:21.530> kind<00:01:21.799> of<00:01:21.860> just<00:01:22.010> take<00:01:22.190> a<00:01:22.220> choose

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:22.460 
so you kind of just take a choose

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:31.340 
along here are all slots for hard drives

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:36.450 
along here are all slots for hard drives
so<00:01:32.030> just<00:01:32.659> find<00:01:32.810> the<00:01:32.930> most<00:01:33.080> appropriate<00:01:33.229> slot
