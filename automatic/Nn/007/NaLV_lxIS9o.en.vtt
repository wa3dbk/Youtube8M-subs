00:00:13.419 --> 00:00:18.199
 attention to the users 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:22.029
 the first car is aimed at women 

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:22.029
 and people with special needs 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:30.279
 Since June 17, the 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:33.550
 information campaign to the user of the 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:35.380
 system through the sound system of the 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:38.230
 stations and trains 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:40.809
 informing users that from 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:43.360
 1st of July there would be an exclusive car 

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:45.790
 for women and the disabled 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:50.260
 were also produced and 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:51.460
 distributed folders at stations and 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:55.840
 three 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:58.120
 the law states that this car 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:00.910
 exclusive it should work on 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:04.780
 certain times are the hours of 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:07.990
 and they do not apply to the purposes of 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:10.320
 week Saturdays Sundays and public holidays 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:13.990
 off peak times 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:17.890
 often the user gets into the car 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:20.320
 without being distracted and can feel 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:23.020
 somewhat constrained in the year 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:26.740
 determined to wake up for that they were 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:27.939
 trained to address these users of 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:31.060
 such that they do not feel 

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:34.680
 embarrassed and get out of a car that 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:34.680
 move to the other car inside 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:41.800
 I think it's fine because if it was another 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:44.680
 as well noted mount well fuller 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:49.750
 It even makes it difficult for the child to 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:52.500
 Guys, I think it's a lot safer. 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:52.500
 but edson bastos 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:59.260
 besides bringing more tranquility and brings 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:00.070
 yet the focus is possible that is my dog 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.050
 guide 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:04.960
 yes the trip it becomes a bit more 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:07.510
 quiet right because you have all that 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:10.270
 squeeze and some even natural that I use 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:12.910
 and then it turns out that until the dog is more 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:14.410
 quiet with values â€‹â€‹even stayed 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:19.060
 even easier because women are the 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:21.880
 argentina not only my straight lines nor 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:31.210
 other people will benefit from 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:33.760
 this brings more comfort is such a case 

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:35.950
 crowded than when shop that way 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:39.010
 different 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:42.040
 in respect to the larger lot speaks brief 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:44.849
 we were sometimes pushed liked 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.849
 competitively 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:52.190
 if I had a daughter I would rather 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.650
 she was in the exclusive wagon to 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:56.710
 women I think it's a security 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:56.710
 more 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:00.380
 the boy even staying here almost 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:02.020
 was prepared when he saw that he was 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:04.570
 full of woman 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:07.540
 He left quickly is very bad I found 

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:10.049
 very cool, I felt so powerful 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:10.049
