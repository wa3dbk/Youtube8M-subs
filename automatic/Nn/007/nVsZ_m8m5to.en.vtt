00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.219
 the ingredients to make this cake 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.480
 they are very simple 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:21.960
 a wafer 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:24.910
 and a jar of Nutella chocolate spread or to 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:27.279
 choose the one that we like 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:31.840
 to make the pie warms the 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:34.110
 nocilla or nutella in a water bath or in 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:34.110
 microwave 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:41.180
 on the presentation plate 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:43.380
 two wafers are put 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:46.650
 if it fits 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:48.890
 the pastry rice to the size of the 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:48.890
 wafer 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:59.680
 it is centered well and now a layer is put 

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:59.680
 tonight already liquid 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:08.200
 As it is very hot it is very melted 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.200
 it extends very well 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.799
 it spreads well with the help of a 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:14.970
 spatula so there is a layer of 

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:16.830
 very finite nocilla 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.370
 but the cake would be too much 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.370
 cloying 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:26.530
 that's why it has to be very hot 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:26.530
 to be able to extend it well 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:36.110
 when extended is the nocilla 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.110
 they put back two new wafers 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:49.170
 and again we chair 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:54.159
 two spoons 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:59.240
 and extend 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.939
 and if it continues like this until you finish with 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:08.240
 wafer and with the jar of nutella or 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:08.240
 nocilla 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:17.480
 This is a cake without an easy oven 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:25.560
 special for the very sweet ones is 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:28.020
 important to extend each layer well 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.880
 is very finite does not matter if it 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:32.330
 press and break the wafer a little 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.330
 why 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:37.180
 then it will compact with him when he 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:40.290
 cool 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:40.290
 and that is not going to be noticed 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:47.050
 You can put the wafers one by one 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:49.980
 two by two three by three and you can 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:49.980
 make the height that 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:56.120
 that we want more or less great I 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:59.349
 I will do with a single package of 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.349
 wafers that are already many 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:04.770
 finally he gets in the last two 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:07.830
 Wafer is like it's the last one 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:11.360
 package is a little broken but the 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:11.360
 complete with other pieces 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:18.330
 another wafer 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:18.330
 and the last layer of no chair 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:24.280
 once it is extended 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:26.290
 the refrigerator is taken so that it 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:28.599
 harden 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:30.250
 with a little bit of body and do it already 

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:34.030
 final decoration of a couple of hours in 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:35.950
 the refrigerator has already hardened and 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:39.370
 now you just have to lift the ring of 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:42.159
 baking with a little care 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:45.180
 The hoop opens and opens with the help of 

00:03:42.159 --> 00:03:47.380
 a knife takes off a little 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:50.250
 and he has stayed 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:50.250
 adhered 

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:03.329
 you can decorate the border with your hands 

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:03.329
 chair I like to leave it like that 

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:12.430
 recommendation 

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:12.430
 take a very small portion
