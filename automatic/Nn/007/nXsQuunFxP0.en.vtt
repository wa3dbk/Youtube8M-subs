00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:13.860
 the recycling kitchen that is not chic not 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.719
 does not do very cool 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.940
 but perhaps one of the kitchens that to me 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.949
 like it better because it reminds me of when 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:23.460
 I was small but also the things I do 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:25.680
 hours and I like that we have chicken that 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.869
 there advanced indeed the truth is that we have 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:31.320
 done more to make it even more 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:34.100
 other recipes and now with peppers 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.690
 we will go to season PCs which is a pasta 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:38.190
 tuscany this in this case uil 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.040
 we have already bought items but it is one 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.079
 this motor craft pasta 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.660
 so we're going to make this pasta 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.350
 because particularly good 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:49.500
 as simple as almost all the 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:53.640
 recipes that we make a little oil in one 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:57.030
 beautiful pan ignite the flame e 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:59.640
 let's put a clove of garlic on this 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:03.239
 case that they are to the Lilliputians ne 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:06.930
 let's put two like this and leave them like this 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:09.360
 shirts must simply give a 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.430
 little bit of oil perfume while 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:15.049
 sieve makes its effect we go to 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.049
 prepare the peppers 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:22.040
 we are going to remove all the part that 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:25.010
 makes the pepper non-digestible all 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:31.310
 seeds actually make it annoying 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:33.080
 just eat them and let's go 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:35.510
 slice peppers into strips 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:38.860
 you choose the form in strips mi 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:38.860
 like a little more 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:49.910
 garlic is certainly flavored 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:51.350
 oil and let's get it off and go to 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:52.930
 put the peppers carefully 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:55.550
 when you do this because 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:58.060
 the oil is boiling now so one risks 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:58.060
 to burn yourself 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:05.230
 in this phase it is not put 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:11.520
 salt you know nothing you don't do 

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:15.670
 flame the peppers I would say 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:21.070
 by now they are practically ready I put them 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:22.860
 a little bit of salt or sauce to the sauce 

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:26.440
 chicken to be added directly 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:28.470
 with peppers being cooked all a 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:31.960
 this point simply needs to be done 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:33.850
 heat and flavor 

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:36.700
 at this point while you are here 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:39.640
 warming up we go to put the PCs 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:42.340
 we go up now being fresh pasta 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:44.560
 I should always put it or at least I do it 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:47.860
 do i actually work a 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:50.860
 oil droplet just to avoid 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:57.220
 that you paste too much pasta e 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:03:00.010
 let's put the pc and fresh pasta a little though 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:03.630
 it takes a while to cook if not 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.630
 it is an immediate cooking of its own 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:12.400
 now we are going to dilute some neuer 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:14.440
 gravy with a little cooking water 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.360
 yes, it also serves to soften his del 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:21.430
 a little bit annoyed but also to create 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:23.080
 a beautiful cream do not think it is 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:25.870
 too much then you will see that later 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:28.150
 will be used to finish cooking let's say 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:31.030
 PCs directly in here 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:33.880
 and at this point I go out of school and the 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:35.830
 let's go straight to the sauce 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:38.230
 see , I'm pulling them up that I'm still 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:40.150
 slightly back to nice cooking at 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:42.450
 the problem of this type of 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:46.840
 fresh pasta that passes from being 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:48.730
 duret a spappolato in the term of nothing 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:51.480
 there is nothing worse than eating 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:51.480
 just evaporate 

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:58.250
 it is often thought that this passage of 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:00.890
 put a little bit of water to finish 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:03.200
 cooking in the pan and stir so 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:05.990
 both a thing of the remaining and at home 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:08.750
 I don't have to do, I don't know for which 

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:10.520
 there is a problem but in reality it is there that the 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:13.520
 real secret for which you can do the 

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:15.200
 pasta that well with diva and absurd 

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:16.940
 this will also allow you to 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:18.950
 better control the cooking because the 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:22.880
 then terminate directly in state 

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:24.410
 following and taking me two minutes three 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:26.210
 minutes, however, it's worth it 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:27.440
 pasta you should not try too 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:29.960
 obviously 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:32.030
 here is one thing I recommend you do e 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:35.120
 not to do what I often do 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:36.410
 that is, to use a pan that is too small 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:37.640
 better to have a frying pan a little more 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:40.550
 great and above all when it had to 

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:43.190
 stir in the dough then work in 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:46.640
 sacrificed way so look at them 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:48.440
 beauty now the last thing is to 

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:52.040
 go and put some cheese 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:53.810
 I put the Parmesan I think the 

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:57.670
 pecorino is too opaque for this 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:57.670
 recipe, however, to your taste 

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:05.220
 two nice turns of parmesan and then from 

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:06.479
 tomorrow we put another bit in the singles 

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:08.190
 dishes 

00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:11.039
 certainly the chicken ragout is not a part 

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:12.690
 aristocracy of dishes 

00:05:11.039 --> 00:05:15.270
 important to me is not that just 

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:17.250
 attracts me, however, even though later 

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:19.229
 end a fish dish comes out 

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:21.300
 of this type here 

00:05:19.229 --> 00:05:23.190
 cheers the chicken and liquid ragÃ¹ 

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:25.440
 now there is practically no longer everything 

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:27.680
 what's left is only one 

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:27.680
 creamy sauce 

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:35.860
 hey presto 

00:05:39.009 --> 00:05:44.110
 and this of course for the photographs 

00:05:41.349 --> 00:05:45.569
 also aesthetic but not to eat it 

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:50.770
 really 

00:05:45.569 --> 00:05:54.099
 never that I do not sacrifice myself for the 

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:56.279
 science for the homeland for I don't know what 

00:05:54.099 --> 00:05:56.279
 thing 

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:11.110
 burn or you can believe it 

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:14.639
 very free not to believe it but it is 

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:14.639
 spectacular good appetite
