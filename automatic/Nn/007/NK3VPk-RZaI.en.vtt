stuff that goes on like the trims or the
baseboards<00:01:49.380> and<00:01:49.470> often<00:01:49.829> it's<00:01:49.979> confusing<00:01:50.369> to

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
baseboards and often it's confusing to

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.090

really<00:06:51.919> awkward<00:06:52.310> to<00:06:52.370> store<00:06:52.669> like<00:06:52.940> the<00:06:53.090> paint

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:53.330 
really awkward to store like the paint

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:55.150 
really awkward to store like the paint
tray<00:06:53.450> is<00:06:53.750> really<00:06:54.020> weird<00:06:54.200> to<00:06:54.380> store<00:06:54.620> and<00:06:54.950> like

00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:55.160 
tray is really weird to store and like

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:58.120 
tray is really weird to store and like
the<00:06:55.880> like<00:06:56.840> you<00:06:56.990> know<00:06:57.020> the<00:06:57.320> paint<00:06:57.530> rollers<00:06:57.890> and

00:06:58.120 --> 00:06:58.130 
the like you know the paint rollers and

00:06:58.130 --> 00:06:59.890 
the like you know the paint rollers and
stuff<00:06:58.310> are<00:06:58.460> really<00:06:58.490> weird<00:06:58.940> so<00:06:59.360> those<00:06:59.510> just<00:06:59.540> fit

00:06:59.890 --> 00:06:59.900 
stuff are really weird so those just fit

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:01.930 
stuff are really weird so those just fit
nicely<00:07:00.080> tucked<00:07:00.740> away<00:07:00.919> inside<00:07:01.250> that<00:07:01.550> bin<00:07:01.700> and

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:01.940 
nicely tucked away inside that bin and

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:03.580 
nicely tucked away inside that bin and
then<00:07:02.090> again<00:07:02.300> I<00:07:02.330> use<00:07:02.540> the<00:07:02.570> bright<00:07:02.900> yellow<00:07:03.080> tape

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:03.590 
then again I use the bright yellow tape

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:05.920 
then again I use the bright yellow tape
so<00:07:03.860> it<00:07:03.979> pops<00:07:04.160> okay<00:07:04.760> so<00:07:04.940> over<00:07:05.180> here<00:07:05.479> I<00:07:05.690> have<00:07:05.900> all

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:05.930 
so it pops okay so over here I have all

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:08.770 
so it pops okay so over here I have all
of<00:07:06.380> the<00:07:06.620> bags<00:07:06.860> for<00:07:07.250> yard<00:07:07.520> work<00:07:07.729> and<00:07:08.419> really

00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:08.780
