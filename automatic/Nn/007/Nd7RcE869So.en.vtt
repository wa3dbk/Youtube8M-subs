00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:08.040
 the one for is the newest of the 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:10.200
 eve online developer ccp games and should 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.820
 link both games together 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.440
 the free to play shooter for the 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.109
 playstation 3 relies on well-known 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.920
 mechanics team spirit and a complex 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.720
 system 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.550
 we slip into the role of one of 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.320
 many immortals clone those of the 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.880
 rulers of the galaxy in battles 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.539
 sent on different planets 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.550
 become 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.900
 There it is hostile in the team 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.250
 to take support points around the 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.470
 enemy command center too 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.730
 destroy or simply the enemy 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.430
 to decimate rows 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.559
 So far, only the game modes are Spanish 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.360
 and English integrated in the open beta 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.610
 more will follow 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.890
 shooter fans will be in the iphone 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.719
 Immediately find your way around enemy 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.820
 Clones must be eliminated and opposing 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.620
 bases are taken by hedging 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.820
 at the large-scale battlefields 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.129
 But it can be something 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.719
 take until you are on target for 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.789
 Metallic possibilities are diverse 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.500
 vehicles and even small spaceships 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.760
 wide to the one to take 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.469
 there are support points as well 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.629
 resounding protected towers or 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:06.150
 warehouse around the army in the fight too 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.920
 we support in a battle 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.900
 we can collect enough points 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.100
 orbit strike by a destroyer in the 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.530
 orbit request 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.450
 our gain in eve online readers 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.860
 the laser cannons through now we have to 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.049
 only one destination on the map 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.990
 select and bum the opposing team 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:23.610
 is razed to the ground 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:25.979
 the coordination between eve online and 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.380
 that is impressive and paves the way 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.909
 for new game mechanics also otherwise 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.130
 makes the title technically sound 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.320
 but figure suffers here and there 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.150
 blurred textures and some wax 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.009
 especially successful is the 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.930
 battlefield map in real time even 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.380
 to see from space in eve online 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.930
 is 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.430
 fit in the sterile command center 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.259
 we take our character for the next one 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.689
 Battle for the extensive skill 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:50.820
 system is more reminiscent of mmo rpg s 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:52.530
 as a shooter before we go 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.180
 get into vehicles and protected towers 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.320
 We must first find the appropriate one 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.240
 buy skills 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.130
 also the equipment of our character 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.899
 can be customized and up 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.380
 tailored to different tactics 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.880
 become 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.070
 here, however, the developers have 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.450
 something bought bought equipment 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.069
 becomes a battlefield at every death 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.270
 damaged and must be so again and again 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:11.430
 to be renewed 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.150
 this system is just beginning 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:17.110
 deter and fits better to one 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:18.720
 rpg with dust 514 go the developers 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:20.680
 first steps in the direction 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.540
 cross-platform gameplay and the 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.829
 theoretical and practical linkage 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:26.079
 they already pretty much 

00:02:23.829 --> 00:02:27.879
 promising only at 

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:29.439
 complex skillsystem and the abt 

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:32.109
 usable equipment shoot the 

00:02:29.439 --> 00:02:33.519
 developer something beyond the goal 

00:02:32.109 --> 00:02:35.409
 So finally with that on the 

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:38.609
 playstation 3 will be successful 

00:02:35.409 --> 00:02:38.609
 therefore still to be seen
