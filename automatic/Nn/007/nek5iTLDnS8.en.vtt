00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
a proof there's another one like it's

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.260 
a proof there's another one like it's
very<00:01:39.090> humid<00:01:39.450> has<00:01:40.080> improved<00:01:40.380> so<00:01:40.710> much<00:01:41.270> but

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
very humid has improved so much but

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.120 
very humid has improved so much but
oddly<00:01:42.510> enough<00:01:42.750> if<00:01:43.080> we<00:01:43.200> were<00:01:43.290> in<00:01:43.380> England<00:01:43.470> it

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
oddly enough if we were in England it

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.550 
oddly enough if we were in England it
would<00:01:44.250> actually<00:01:44.520> be<00:01:44.580> worse<00:01:44.700> than<00:01:44.940> this<00:01:45.120> which

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 
would actually be worse than this which

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.510 
would actually be worse than this which
you<00:01:46.560> know<00:01:46.650> makes<00:01:46.860> me<00:01:46.980> wonder<00:01:47.190> about<00:01:47.370> the

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
you know makes me wonder about the

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.649 
you know makes me wonder about the
British<00:01:47.790> people

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.450 

when<00:01:52.200> I<00:01:52.229> was<00:01:52.409> in<00:01:52.530> England<00:01:52.829> I<00:01:52.920> saw<00:01:53.070> some<00:01:53.310> like

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
when I was in England I saw some like

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.279 
when I was in England I saw some like
horrible<00:01:53.909> weather<00:01:54.090> conditions<00:01:54.570> and<00:01:54.810> nobody

00:01:55.279 --> 00:01:55.289 
horrible weather conditions and nobody
