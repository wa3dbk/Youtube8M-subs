00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:48.730 
let's get into it first of all what I

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:50.639 
let's get into it first of all what I
was<00:00:48.820> thinking<00:00:49.300> of<00:00:49.510> doing<00:00:49.600> a<00:00:50.140> massive

00:00:50.639 --> 00:00:50.649 
was thinking of doing a massive

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:52.319 
was thinking of doing a massive
collaboration<00:00:50.980> with<00:00:51.489> Danish<00:00:51.820> man<00:00:52.000> and<00:00:52.180> dat

00:00:52.319 --> 00:00:52.329 
collaboration with Danish man and dat

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:54.420 
collaboration with Danish man and dat
fat<00:00:52.539> ass<00:00:52.719> and<00:00:52.989> pretty<00:00:53.649> much<00:00:53.680> what<00:00:53.949> we<00:00:53.980> do<00:00:54.250> is

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:54.430 
fat ass and pretty much what we do is

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:57.029 
fat ass and pretty much what we do is
like<00:00:54.460> a<00:00:54.789> faction<00:00:55.300> movie<00:00:55.629> type<00:00:55.840> of<00:00:56.019> thing<00:00:56.230> i<00:00:56.440> did

00:00:57.029 --> 00:00:57.039 
like a faction movie type of thing i did

00:00:57.039 --> 00:00:58.970 
like a faction movie type of thing i did
this<00:00:57.280> sort<00:00:57.550> of<00:00:57.609> thing<00:00:57.670> for<00:00:57.969> 1000<00:00:58.660> subscribers

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
this sort of thing for 1000 subscribers

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.500 
this sort of thing for 1000 subscribers
but<00:00:59.980> i<00:01:00.129> thought<00:01:00.429> i<00:01:00.489> might<00:01:00.730> do<00:01:00.910> it<00:01:01.030> again<00:01:01.090> just

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:01.510 
but i thought i might do it again just

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:03.479 
but i thought i might do it again just
because<00:01:01.660> you<00:01:02.260> guys<00:01:02.410> seem<00:01:02.769> to<00:01:02.800> really<00:01:03.010> enjoy

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:03.489 
because you guys seem to really enjoy

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:05.790 
because you guys seem to really enjoy
that<00:01:03.910> and<00:01:04.300> i<00:01:04.839> think<00:01:05.140> if<00:01:05.290> we<00:01:05.410> did<00:01:05.590> like<00:01:05.620> a

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:05.800 
that and i think if we did like a

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:08.310 
that and i think if we did like a
massive<00:01:06.220> right<00:01:06.640> like<00:01:06.820> we<00:01:07.390> all<00:01:07.570> attempted<00:01:08.170> to

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:08.320 
massive right like we all attempted to

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.260 
massive right like we all attempted to
like<00:01:08.500> read<00:01:08.770> like<00:01:09.040> a<00:01:09.070> really<00:01:09.370> big<00:01:09.640> faction<00:01:10.150> on

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:10.270 
like read like a really big faction on

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:12.750 
like read like a really big faction on
Gont<00:01:10.510> roller<00:01:10.810> or<00:01:11.230> like<00:01:11.500> a<00:01:11.530> decent<00:01:11.890> size<00:01:12.370> based

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:12.760 
Gont roller or like a decent size based

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:15.000 
Gont roller or like a decent size based
on<00:01:13.000> Gont<00:01:13.240> roller<00:01:13.570> and<00:01:13.690> to<00:01:14.140> see<00:01:14.440> how<00:01:14.710> well<00:01:14.980> it

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:15.010 
on Gont roller and to see how well it

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:16.920 
on Gont roller and to see how well it
goes<00:01:15.160> like<00:01:15.490> oh<00:01:15.760> of<00:01:15.910> course<00:01:15.940> i<00:01:16.360> would<00:01:16.450> edit<00:01:16.660> out

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:16.930

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:20.550 
some of the boring bits speed up some
others<00:01:18.940> and<00:01:19.270> it<00:01:19.450> wouldn't<00:01:19.750> just<00:01:20.020> be<00:01:20.110> the<00:01:20.350> raid

it's<00:01:42.340> resetting<00:01:42.790> anytime<00:01:43.270> soon<00:01:43.540> i<00:01:43.780> think<00:01:44.050> it

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:44.170 
it's resetting anytime soon i think it

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:45.750 
it's resetting anytime soon i think it
may<00:01:44.410> be<00:01:44.440> like<00:01:44.710> a<00:01:44.740> month<00:01:45.040> or<00:01:45.160> 2<00:01:45.310> i'm<00:01:45.430> not<00:01:45.580> sure

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:45.760 
may be like a month or 2 i'm not sure

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:48.180

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:48.190 
but I'm the next thing I wanted to talk

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:50.190 
but I'm the next thing I wanted to talk
about<00:01:48.250> is<00:01:48.730> possibly<00:01:49.330> starting<00:01:49.810> up<00:01:49.960> my<00:01:49.990> own

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:50.200 
about is possibly starting up my own

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.280 
about is possibly starting up my own
server<00:01:50.620> this<00:01:51.550> is<00:01:51.760> all<00:01:51.970> just<00:01:52.240> in<00:01:52.480> my<00:01:52.720> brain<00:01:52.990> like

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:53.290 
server this is all just in my brain like

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:55.020 
server this is all just in my brain like
thinking<00:01:53.800> like<00:01:53.860> nothing's<00:01:54.520> definite<00:01:54.970> yet

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:55.030 
thinking like nothing's definite yet

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:56.880 
thinking like nothing's definite yet
nothing's<00:01:55.630> been<00:01:55.900> planned<00:01:56.200> nothing's<00:01:56.710> been

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:56.890 
nothing's been planned nothing's been

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:59.280 
nothing's been planned nothing's been
started<00:01:57.400> but<00:01:58.300> I'm<00:01:58.450> thinking<00:01:58.840> of<00:01:58.930> starting<00:01:59.110> my

00:01:59.280 --> 00:01:59.290 
started but I'm thinking of starting my

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:01.890 
started but I'm thinking of starting my
own<00:01:59.410> faction<00:01:59.800> server<00:02:00.190> just<00:02:00.520> because<00:02:00.910> I<00:02:01.150> don't

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:01.900 
own faction server just because I don't

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:03.150 
own faction server just because I don't
know<00:02:01.990> I've<00:02:02.170> just<00:02:02.320> been<00:02:02.470> thinking<00:02:02.710> about<00:02:03.040> it

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:03.160 
know I've just been thinking about it

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:04.500 
know I've just been thinking about it
for<00:02:03.280> a<00:02:03.460> while<00:02:03.610> and<00:02:03.820> I<00:02:03.910> think<00:02:04.150> it<00:02:04.270> would<00:02:04.360> be<00:02:04.390> a

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:04.510 
for a while and I think it would be a

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:06.150 
for a while and I think it would be a
great<00:02:04.720> idea<00:02:04.870> if<00:02:05.290> I<00:02:05.530> could<00:02:05.740> get<00:02:05.890> it<00:02:06.010> together

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:06.160 
great idea if I could get it together

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:08.130 
great idea if I could get it together
but<00:02:06.880> could<00:02:07.030> possibly<00:02:07.450> get<00:02:07.600> some<00:02:07.840> kind<00:02:08.080> of

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:08.140 
but could possibly get some kind of

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:10.400 
but could possibly get some kind of
sponsorship<00:02:08.770> sponsorship<00:02:09.700> for<00:02:09.940> a<00:02:09.970> server

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
sponsorship sponsorship for a server

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.660

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670
