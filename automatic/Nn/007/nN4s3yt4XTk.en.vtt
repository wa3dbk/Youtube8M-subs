most house plants benefit from being

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.700 
most house plants benefit from being
repotted<00:00:17.369> every<00:00:17.550> couple<00:00:17.850> of<00:00:17.880> years<00:00:18.500> make<00:00:19.500> sure

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
repotted every couple of years make sure

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.890 
repotted every couple of years make sure
that<00:00:19.920> you<00:00:20.039> realize<00:00:20.189> that<00:00:20.640> once<00:00:21.270> you<00:00:21.359> repot<00:00:21.779> the

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
that you realize that once you repot the

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.870 
that you realize that once you repot the
plants<00:00:22.380> into<00:00:22.800> a<00:00:22.859> larger<00:00:23.220> pot<00:00:23.430> it<00:00:23.640> will

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
plants into a larger pot it will

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.849 
plants into a larger pot it will
actually<00:00:24.300> grow<00:00:24.510> bigger<00:00:24.779> so<00:00:25.439> you'll<00:00:25.680> need<00:00:25.800> a

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
actually grow bigger so you'll need a

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.429 
actually grow bigger so you'll need a
bigger<00:00:26.130> space<00:00:26.279> to<00:00:26.609> keep<00:00:26.760> it<00:00:26.939> in<00:00:27.170> this<00:00:28.170> is<00:00:28.320> how

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
bigger space to keep it in this is how

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.030 
bigger space to keep it in this is how
you<00:00:28.500> do<00:00:28.740> it<00:00:29.390> select<00:00:30.390> a<00:00:30.539> pot<00:00:30.779> that's<00:00:31.679> slightly

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
you do it select a pot that's slightly

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.970 
you do it select a pot that's slightly
larger<00:00:32.759> one<00:00:32.940> or<00:00:33.210> two<00:00:33.450> sizes<00:00:33.870> larger<00:00:34.380> than<00:00:34.860> the

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
larger one or two sizes larger than the

larger one or two sizes larger than the
existing<00:00:35.460> pot<00:00:35.730> and<00:00:36.540> put<00:00:37.380> a<00:00:37.410> layer<00:00:37.739> of
