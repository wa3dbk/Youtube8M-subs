hardware stores I got my radio shack hey
when<00:00:26.010> you<00:00:26.130> get<00:00:26.310> one<00:00:26.490> try<00:00:26.789> to<00:00:26.849> get<00:00:27.090> 1<00:00:27.300> over<00:00:27.660> 5

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
when you get one try to get 1 over 5

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.990 
when you get one try to get 1 over 5
volts<00:00:28.680> and<00:00:28.830> with<00:00:29.760> at<00:00:29.910> least<00:00:30.060> half<00:00:30.390> a<00:00:30.750> watt<00:00:30.900> of

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:32.000 
volts and with at least half a watt of

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.620 
volts and with at least half a watt of
energy<00:00:33.260> so<00:00:34.260> mine<00:00:34.680> was<00:00:34.860> 6<00:00:35.309> watts<00:00:35.579> and<00:00:35.850> I'm<00:00:36.420> in

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
energy so mine was 6 watts and I'm in

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.920 
energy so mine was 6 watts and I'm in
six<00:00:36.899> bolts<00:00:37.320> and<00:00:37.530> one<00:00:37.770> walk<00:00:38.010> and<00:00:38.450> I<00:00:39.450> got<00:00:39.629> it<00:00:39.780> for

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
I did what this was I got a 5 volt

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.600 
I did what this was I got a 5 volt
regulator<00:00:51.680> for<00:00:52.680> you<00:00:52.920> that<00:00:53.070> don't<00:00:53.309> know<00:00:53.460> what

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
regulator for you that don't know what

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:59.590 
regulator for you that don't know what
that<00:00:53.789> is<00:00:54.680> it<00:00:55.680> it<00:00:56.219> regulates<00:00:56.780> or<00:00:57.780> five<00:00:58.199> volts

00:00:59.590 --> 00:00:59.600 
that is it it regulates or five volts

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.959 
that is it it regulates or five volts
you<00:01:00.600> could<00:01:00.780> put<00:01:00.899> any<00:01:01.170> any<00:01:01.649> wall<00:01:02.520> like<00:01:02.760> nine

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
you could put any any wall like nine

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.980 
you could put any any wall like nine
volts<00:01:03.329> temples<00:01:03.719> 12<00:01:04.049> volts<00:01:05.510> put<00:01:06.510> it<00:01:06.600> into<00:01:06.840> here

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
volts temples 12 volts put it into here

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.539 
volts temples 12 volts put it into here
and<00:01:07.049> it<00:01:07.260> turns<00:01:07.409> into<00:01:07.560> 5<00:01:07.860> volts<00:01:08.189> so<00:01:08.310> it<00:01:08.400> could<00:01:08.520> be

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
and it turns into 5 volts so it could be

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.460 
and it turns into 5 volts so it could be
safe<00:01:08.850> to<00:01:09.060> charge<00:01:09.450> phone<00:01:09.720> so<00:01:10.080> I<00:01:10.110> Paul<00:01:10.350> it

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
safe to charge phone so I Paul it

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.640 
safe to charge phone so I Paul it
