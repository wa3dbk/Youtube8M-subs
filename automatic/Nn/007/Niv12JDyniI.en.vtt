 The function is recommended in a simple way You can search for three types of route priority expressway priority general road priority 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:49.720
 There is a parking lot search function that shows 24,000 locations full at a glance. 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:52.610
 It is not that there is a great for even big sucking say function of 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:56.510

 I tried to put in a iphone 5 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:12.140
 Now 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:16.610
 19:21 but it is 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:19.390
 Please see that night mode 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:19.390
 Kobe at night 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:30.190
 It is such a feeling 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:33.120
 So , for example, I'm going to search various things here, there is an address and a setting screen . 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:33.120
 I will try to do a little 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:38.090
 It will be in this kind of screen 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:50.380
 Well even though there is also Toka link of yahoo relationship 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.140
 Because say rise to Japan 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:05.890
 For example , if it is a convenience store , you can select one of these and press it now to see which map to display 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:05.890
 Also so out it is on the puppy 

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:13.910
 I and bad It is like this only Well simple also to other 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:16.990
 Yes and yeah yeah back to the picture map 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:19.520
 Of the search window the way 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:22.750
 How can i put it 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:25.420
 Shall we do something in a paragenre? 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:29.370
 By genre a 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:32.380
 Photo cane to the I eat 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:34.780
 Intense sexual Kana 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:38.380
 Shall we gust? 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:40.360
 I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm out of this house now 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:43.320
 I said superb 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.320
 It came out with such a feeling 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:47.590
 The 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:53.590
 Yes, it's like this, Osaka City and I just have a loan 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:58.010
 When I press something to go here 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:12.380
 It becomes like this 

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:14.380
 Recommendation does not come out first, but does not get on expressway, but is also said expressway 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:19.290
 And 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:19.290
 Well general priority wonder if because there is no high-speed 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:28.370
 Yes , the general priority is probably yes 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:29.030
 As you can jam with the press most do we're in recommended I think you choose a closer distance in a straight line 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:35.270
 like this 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:36.990
 I think I wish I think we bypass this now 37 become the wind I become pressed, the 28 two Recommended 

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:41.260
 Maybe I think that's the case 

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:45.890
 And I will try to start navigation 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:47.400
 Please drive according to the actual traffic rules 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:51.780
 In ok 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:56.740
 So the cheese comes out like this with the total number 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:04:00.100
 This I now Well Kedomo here found strange is I'm car navigation plain of the same as much 

00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:04.630
 I do not control the rotation but I'm free 

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:07.340
 It does not seem to correspond to the horizontal screen 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:11.540
 It is a vertical screen fixed 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:12.860
 And here it comes out whether you want to turn it into big suo or turn it off 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:17.560
 I will 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:21.639
 So scaling can be done normally with this 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:27.129
 I think it is relatively new car navigation but 

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:29.979
 I think it is worthwhile to use it once, google map and close 

00:04:27.129 --> 00:04:33.129
 How about using it? 

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:37.659
 Yes this time for the first time in the news 

00:04:33.129 --> 00:04:40.139
 Was probably today and I think you tag 3 t date was there a story of Yahoo car navigation system's release 

00:04:37.659 --> 00:04:40.139
 Or in other 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:43.340
 If it is a bar
