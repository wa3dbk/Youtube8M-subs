place is also marked on the map since
link<00:00:46.320> is<00:00:46.440> here<00:00:46.649> now<00:00:46.829> this<00:00:47.489> is<00:00:47.550> the<00:00:47.789> distance<00:00:48.090> he

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
link is here now this is the distance he

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.209 
link is here now this is the distance he
needs<00:00:48.360> to<00:00:48.450> traverse<00:00:48.780> you<00:00:49.410> can<00:00:49.559> also<00:00:49.680> zoom<00:00:49.800> in

and you can also zoom out and out and
further<00:00:56.430> up<00:00:56.670> that's<00:00:57.539> a<00:00:57.629> huge<00:00:57.930> world<00:00:58.230> we

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
further up that's a huge world we

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.229 
further up that's a huge world we
haven't<00:00:59.219> even<00:00:59.280> seen<00:00:59.550> the<00:00:59.609> whole<00:00:59.789> world<00:01:00.030> yet

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
haven't even seen the whole world yet

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.740 
haven't even seen the whole world yet
this<00:01:01.020> must<00:01:01.230> be<00:01:01.350> the<00:01:01.469> edge<00:01:01.559> of<00:01:01.710> the<00:01:01.770> map<00:01:02.510> how<00:01:03.510> far

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
this must be the edge of the map how far

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.410 
this must be the edge of the map how far
are<00:01:03.870> we<00:01:03.899> from<00:01:03.989> here<00:01:04.260> to<00:01:04.439> the<00:01:04.530> edge<00:01:04.619> of<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:04.799> map

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:05.420 
are we from here to the edge of the map

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.030 
are we from here to the edge of the map
yeah<00:01:06.420> it<00:01:06.540> would<00:01:06.659> take<00:01:07.080> a<00:01:07.110> very<00:01:07.260> long<00:01:07.530> time<00:01:07.680> for

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
yeah it would take a very long time for

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.980 
yeah it would take a very long time for
link<00:01:08.189> to<00:01:08.280> walk<00:01:10.400> anyway<00:01:11.400> we<00:01:12.210> try<00:01:12.570> to<00:01:12.630> go<00:01:12.780> to<00:01:12.810> the

link to walk anyway we try to go to the

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.910 
link to walk anyway we try to go to the
point<00:01:13.380> that<00:01:13.619> we<00:01:13.799> marked<00:01:14.040> on<00:01:14.189> the<00:01:14.250> map<00:01:15.619> whoa

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
point that we marked on the map whoa

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.010
