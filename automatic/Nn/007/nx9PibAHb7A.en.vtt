this this area in your end this is love

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.770 
this this area in your end this is love
level<00:01:20.420> and<00:01:20.630> in<00:01:21.260> here<00:01:21.590> it<00:01:21.830> is<00:01:22.159> max<00:01:22.430> level<00:01:22.670> an<00:01:22.970> oil

next step is that when this is clean you

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:34.330 
next step is that when this is clean you
need<00:01:30.950> to<00:01:31.159> insert<00:01:31.610> this<00:01:32.170> this<00:01:33.170> tick<00:01:33.470> in<00:01:33.770> pack<00:01:34.070> in
