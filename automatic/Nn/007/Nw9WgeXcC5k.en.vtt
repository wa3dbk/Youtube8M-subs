difficult to push into the bottom so

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:15.560

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:53.520 
and finally we're getting to the flip

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:55.430 
and finally we're getting to the flip
all<00:03:54.030> the<00:03:54.300> events<00:03:54.660> in<00:03:54.780> the<00:03:54.870> flip<00:03:55.080> happen

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440 
all the events in the flip happen

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:57.800 
all the events in the flip happen
simultaneously<00:03:55.680> I<00:03:56.520> snipe<00:03:57.060> someone<00:03:57.510> at<00:03:57.690> the

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
simultaneously I snipe someone at the

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:59.390 
simultaneously I snipe someone at the
bottom<00:03:57.990> exit<00:03:58.500> as<00:03:58.620> someone<00:03:58.980> at<00:03:59.100> the<00:03:59.190> top

bottom exit as someone at the top

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.400 
bottom exit as someone at the top
crosses<00:03:59.910> the<00:04:00.030> small<00:04:00.300> flip<00:04:00.600> line<00:04:00.810> and<00:04:01.020> you'll

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:01.410 
crosses the small flip line and you'll

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:03.680 
crosses the small flip line and you'll
see<00:04:01.650> that<00:04:01.680> this<00:04:02.340> is<00:04:02.550> what<00:04:02.730> a<00:04:02.760> small<00:04:03.060> flip<00:04:03.330> is<00:04:03.480> is

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:03.690 
see that this is what a small flip is is

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:05.510 
see that this is what a small flip is is
when<00:04:04.110> one<00:04:04.290> or<00:04:04.410> two<00:04:04.530> enemies<00:04:04.860> die<00:04:05.070> in<00:04:05.220> the<00:04:05.280> time

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:05.520 
when one or two enemies die in the time

frame that the small slip line has been

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:09.680 
frame that the small slip line has been
crossed<00:04:07.560> if<00:04:08.340> you<00:04:08.580> cross<00:04:08.850> into<00:04:09.030> the<00:04:09.150> red<00:04:09.420> you

crossed if you cross into the red you

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:12.110 
crossed if you cross into the red you
displace<00:04:10.080> the<00:04:10.320> spawn<00:04:10.560> for<00:04:10.860> around<00:04:11.130> 15<00:04:11.610> seconds

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
displace the spawn for around 15 seconds

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.150 
displace the spawn for around 15 seconds
even<00:04:12.780> if<00:04:12.900> you<00:04:12.990> back<00:04:13.200> up<00:04:13.410> the<00:04:13.620> enemies<00:04:13.980> won't

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:14.160 
even if you back up the enemies won't

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.789 
even if you back up the enemies won't
spawn<00:04:14.460> properly<00:04:15.090> small<00:04:15.960> flip<00:04:16.230> lines<00:04:16.500> are

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:16.799 
spawn properly small flip lines are

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:19.039 
spawn properly small flip lines are
where<00:04:17.340> most<00:04:17.400> people<00:04:17.940> make<00:04:18.150> mistakes<00:04:18.299> due<00:04:18.900> to

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:19.049 
where most people make mistakes due to

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:20.479 
where most people make mistakes due to
the<00:04:19.140> fact<00:04:19.350> that<00:04:19.560> last<00:04:19.859> time<00:04:20.100> you<00:04:20.250> were<00:04:20.370> there

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
the fact that last time you were there

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:22.520 
the fact that last time you were there
no<00:04:20.910> flip<00:04:21.209> occurred<00:04:21.540> that's<00:04:22.049> because<00:04:22.380> no

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:22.530 
no flip occurred that's because no

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:24.590 
no flip occurred that's because no
enemies<00:04:22.920> died<00:04:23.160> at<00:04:23.310> the<00:04:23.400> time<00:04:23.610> so<00:04:24.210> if<00:04:24.330> you<00:04:24.450> need

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:24.600 
enemies died at the time so if you need

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:26.720 
enemies died at the time so if you need
to<00:04:24.690> revisit<00:04:25.020> those<00:04:25.320> still<00:04:25.620> frames<00:04:25.890> please<00:04:26.400> do
