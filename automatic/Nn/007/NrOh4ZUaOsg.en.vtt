00:00:10.709 --> 00:00:16.140
 today we are going to make a recipe with a 

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:19.630
 amazing cereal that is quinoa 

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:23.039
 here we have it there are different brands 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:25.720
 we have the barn we have basket deco 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:28.359
 so here we have this cereal is a 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:29.830
 amazing cereal because it contains the 

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:32.199
 double the proteins that cereals 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:34.750
 usual but apart has less 

00:00:32.199 --> 00:00:37.449
 Carbohydrates have many vitamins 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:39.339
 group b many minerals and has fats 

00:00:37.449 --> 00:00:42.640
 healthy and you are following some type 

00:00:39.339 --> 00:00:44.920
 of special diet you do not want to get fat 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.539
 others and obviously you can not stop 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.879
 side if you follow this diet you can not 

00:00:46.539 --> 00:00:51.250
 leave cereals aside as the 

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:53.859
 Quinoa is an extraordinary option 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:55.859
 because it has less good carbohydrates 

00:00:53.859 --> 00:01:00.160
 Well, we're going to need quinoa 

00:00:55.859 --> 00:01:00.850
 approximately 250 grams for two 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.920
 people 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:06.000
 we are going to need green pepper 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:09.630
 red pepper onion sesame seeds 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.630
 flax seeds and let's use 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.960
 I have been presenting different 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:17.640
 This tofu formats for example 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:20.820
 this was a mediterranean mild flavor 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.740
 well packed and you'll see what it looks like 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.560
 has the color red is because it has 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.450
 tomato and takes paprika place that you 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.329
 I want to present this way informatively 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.850
 so that you go knowing more more 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:35.539
 food to prepare soy fillets 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.539
 textured 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:42.570
 come this way what we do very 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.370
 simple we get soaking nothing very 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.760
 little time we let them soak 5 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:50.160
 minutes and they stay soft what 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:52.530
 we do is put them on the grill in a 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:56.430
 pan and we can add what 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:58.230
 we want spices seeds what 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.510
 we want to accompany simply 

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:02.850
 We present what is worth we go with the recipe 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:06.120
 that concerns us today we are going to 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:08.850
 put water to cook to cook the quinoa 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:11.400
 exactly like any cereal 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:13.830
 that any pasta that we're going to go 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.560
 chopping the ingredients the quinoa 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:18.840
 We have many ways to cook it 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:22.100
 we can make it like pasta 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:25.020
 we can make soup with quinoa we can 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:26.870
 make salads with quinoa now that 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:28.690
 comes the warmth 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:30.920
 well then let's chop the onion 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:33.020
 little you know 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:35.390
 red peppers and we have it we have 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:37.010
 used a little bit in another recipe what 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:38.930
 we have in the fridge what we do is 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:41.690
 that we removed the edge cited that it 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:45.700
 it is soft , we are going to cut it in 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:45.700
 finite bands 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.590
 if you do not like tofu in any of your 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:59.900
 varieties we can do perfectly 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.900
 this recipe content with seitan 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:05.370
 we have cooking the quinoa and you are going to see 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:10.250
 what more different shape does it take once 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:13.030
 is cooked to put our skillet 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:13.030
 quito 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:20.470
 and let's start with the sofrito 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:22.390
 let's take 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:24.610
 although we have also split it in 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:27.970
 small bits we're going to be a tad 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:30.310
 before the pepper that takes longer to fry 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:32.300
 I know the onion so we do not know 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:35.860
 onion 

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:35.860
 we pepper first 

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:41.739
 we will use 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:46.799
 half of tofu is the other half we're going 

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:46.799
 to use in the fridge 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:55.340
 when we see that he is taking color he cited 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:55.340
 the pepper add the onion 

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:02.409
 as seeing that it does not burn 

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:09.650
 we are going to be already 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.650
 the piece to like 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:14.170
 Well, I remember again if you do not like the 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:17.019
 tofu this recipe can be done 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:20.190
 perfectly with bits of 6 give 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:20.190
 decent kittens 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:27.030
 it remains very delicately let's undo 

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:29.060
 the touch a little more so that it is 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:29.060
 plus 

00:04:32.759 --> 00:04:40.319
 a seen to build a little bit of 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:40.319
 oil let's add a little more 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.970
 captain and we wait for it to be cooked 

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:47.970
 quinoa 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:51.800
 is worth the quinoa is already cooked 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:04.620
 of the grain that was when cooked is 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:04.620
 it looks like it's transparent 

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:09.730
 the quinoa 

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:21.699
 we need a colander with holes 

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:25.770
 very tiny because if not it is not the 

00:05:21.699 --> 00:05:25.770
 moment to add the salt 

00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:31.970
 Sesame seeds 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:37.700
 and flax seeds 

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.210
 Another handful of this recipe could come 

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:40.840
 very well 

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:43.620
 some raisins 

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:43.620
 if you like 

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:47.900
 to us is that we do not like them 

00:05:45.639 --> 00:05:50.300
 too 

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:52.660
 but if you like I would give that touch 

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:52.660
 sweet 

00:05:53.950 --> 00:06:00.970
 you would stay with this recipe of the 

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:03.490
 nuts when adding the tofu that I had 

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:06.040
 tomato we have managed to keep a 

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:07.690
 little bit red because it would be ready 

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:10.420
 today's recipe as always is super 

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:12.160
 easy super fast if you like 

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:16.590
 I hope you put some comment on 

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:16.590
