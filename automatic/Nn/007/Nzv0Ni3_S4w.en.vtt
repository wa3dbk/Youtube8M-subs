locks<00:00:28.380> and<00:00:28.650> I<00:00:29.400> think<00:00:29.609> that<00:00:29.699> knife<00:00:29.849> is<00:00:30.029> an

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
locks and I think that knife is an

locks and I think that knife is an
outstanding<00:00:30.510> knife<00:00:32.210> most<00:00:33.210> Victor<00:00:33.570> Knox

products<00:00:34.230> in<00:00:34.410> my<00:00:34.800> opinion<00:00:35.250> are<00:00:35.430> pretty<00:00:36.390> good

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
products in my opinion are pretty good

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:42.229 
products in my opinion are pretty good
but<00:00:37.550> this<00:00:38.550> this<00:00:39.300> Sentinel<00:00:39.809> is<00:00:40.670> and<00:00:41.670> the<00:00:41.820> design

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
but this this Sentinel is and the design

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.479 
but this this Sentinel is and the design
the<00:00:42.480> engineering<00:00:42.870> on<00:00:43.110> it<00:00:43.320> it's<00:00:43.440> just<00:00:43.770> funky<00:00:44.280> I

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
the engineering on it it's just funky I

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.860 
the engineering on it it's just funky I
don't<00:00:45.120> get<00:00:45.329> it<00:00:45.450> at<00:00:45.539> all<00:00:46.250> it<00:00:47.250> has<00:00:47.309> a<00:00:47.809> you<00:00:48.809> know

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
don't get it at all it has a you know

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.020 
don't get it at all it has a you know
the<00:00:49.020> blade<00:00:49.230> for<00:00:49.500> one-hand<00:00:49.920> opening<00:00:50.070> which<00:00:50.879> is

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
the blade for one-hand opening which is

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.240 
the blade for one-hand opening which is
fine<00:00:51.329> that<00:00:51.660> works<00:00:51.809> ok

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
fine that works ok

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.869 
fine that works ok
but<00:00:53.969> the<00:00:54.090> lock<00:00:54.329> is<00:00:54.570> bass-ackwards<00:00:55.520> it<00:00:56.520> at

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
but the lock is bass-ackwards it at

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.369 
but the lock is bass-ackwards it at
least<00:00:57.149> for<00:00:57.420> me<00:00:57.539> most<00:00:57.960> people<00:00:58.109> are

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
least for me most people are

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.770 
least for me most people are
right-handed<00:00:58.850> they've<00:00:59.850> got<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.180> knife<00:01:00.329> setup

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
right-handed they've got the knife setup

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.240 
right-handed they've got the knife setup
for<00:01:00.989> right-handed<00:01:01.379> carry<00:01:01.649> with<00:01:01.829> the<00:01:01.920> clip<00:01:02.100> on

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
for right-handed carry with the clip on

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.469 
for right-handed carry with the clip on
this<00:01:02.430> side<00:01:02.670> it<00:01:03.390> seems<00:01:03.570> like<00:01:03.840> to<00:01:03.960> me<00:01:03.989> and<00:01:05.479> it's

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
this side it seems like to me and it's

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.890 
this side it seems like to me and it's
the<00:01:07.470> liner<00:01:07.740> lock<00:01:08.040> here<00:01:08.400> it's<00:01:08.670> just<00:01:08.909> it's<00:01:09.840> just

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
the liner lock here it's just it's just

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.780 
the liner lock here it's just it's just
backwards<00:01:10.290> you<00:01:10.619> know<00:01:10.799> you<00:01:10.979> gotta<00:01:11.130> kind<00:01:11.760> of

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
backwards you know you gotta kind of

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.219 
backwards you know you gotta kind of
grab<00:01:12.000> it<00:01:12.180> like<00:01:12.210> this<00:01:12.479> and<00:01:12.750> then<00:01:12.840> pull<00:01:13.049> it<00:01:13.140> over

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
grab it like this and then pull it over

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.130 
grab it like this and then pull it over
it<00:01:13.439> just<00:01:13.470> feels<00:01:13.770> awkward<00:01:14.040> to<00:01:14.280> me<00:01:14.960> it<00:01:15.960> would

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
it just feels awkward to me it would

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.190 
it just feels awkward to me it would
make<00:01:16.320> a<00:01:16.350> whole<00:01:16.560> lot<00:01:16.770> more<00:01:16.979> sense<00:01:17.220> to<00:01:17.400> me<00:01:17.520> if<00:01:17.939> it

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:18.200 
make a whole lot more sense to me if it

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.480 
make a whole lot more sense to me if it
if<00:01:19.200> the<00:01:19.259> liner<00:01:19.590> lock<00:01:19.770> were<00:01:19.920> on<00:01:20.009> the<00:01:20.100> opposite

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
if the liner lock were on the opposite

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.130 
if the liner lock were on the opposite
side<00:01:20.670> and<00:01:20.880> you<00:01:21.000> can<00:01:21.119> just<00:01:21.330> push<00:01:21.540> it<00:01:21.720> and<00:01:21.840> close

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
side and you can just push it and close

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.859 
side and you can just push it and close
it<00:01:22.170> one-handed<00:01:22.680> as<00:01:22.979> well<00:01:23.220> as<00:01:23.460> it<00:01:24.360> stands<00:01:24.600> now

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
it one-handed as well as it stands now

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.039 
it one-handed as well as it stands now
you<00:01:24.900> you<00:01:25.470> almost<00:01:25.799> have<00:01:26.189> to<00:01:26.509> use<00:01:27.509> two<00:01:27.810> hands

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
you you almost have to use two hands

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:29.450 
you you almost have to use two hands
with<00:01:28.290> it<00:01:28.470> and<00:01:28.619> I<00:01:28.650> think<00:01:28.710> it<00:01:28.950> defeats<00:01:29.250> the<00:01:29.369> whole

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
with it and I think it defeats the whole

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.819 
with it and I think it defeats the whole
purpose<00:01:29.820> of<00:01:30.119> having<00:01:30.180> a<00:01:30.450> one-handed<00:01:31.079> you<00:01:31.740> know

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
purpose of having a one-handed you know

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.219 
purpose of having a one-handed you know
opening<00:01:32.220> knife<00:01:32.430> or<00:01:32.670> whatever<00:01:32.930> maybe<00:01:33.930> they<00:01:34.110> did

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
opening knife or whatever maybe they did

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:35.810 
opening knife or whatever maybe they did
that<00:01:34.350> on<00:01:34.470> purpose<00:01:34.500> for<00:01:34.979> a<00:01:35.009> safety<00:01:35.400> feature<00:01:35.549> or

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
that on purpose for a safety feature or

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.539 
that on purpose for a safety feature or
something<00:01:35.850> I<00:01:36.299> don't<00:01:36.360> really<00:01:36.540> know<00:01:36.810> but<00:01:37.740> to<00:01:38.400> me

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
something I don't really know but to me

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.090 
something I don't really know but to me
it<00:01:38.670> sucks<00:01:39.470> the<00:01:40.470> other<00:01:40.590> thing<00:01:40.740> that<00:01:40.770> sucks

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
it sucks the other thing that sucks

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.550 
it sucks the other thing that sucks
about<00:01:41.189> this<00:01:41.369> knife<00:01:41.670> is<00:01:41.939> the<00:01:42.509> scales<00:01:42.869> on<00:01:43.170> it<00:01:43.320> and

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:39.500 
107 3/4 inches and the blade length
looks<00:02:38.280> like<00:02:38.460> it's<00:02:38.640> about<00:02:38.730> three<00:02:39.210> and<00:02:39.420> a

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
looks like it's about three and a

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:44.750 
looks like it's about three and a
quarter<00:02:39.690> as<00:02:40.050> well<00:02:41.960> so<00:02:43.220> let's<00:02:44.220> see<00:02:44.430> here<00:02:44.610> when

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
quarter as well so let's see here when

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.880 
quarter as well so let's see here when
it's<00:02:44.880> closed<00:02:45.180> up<00:02:45.480> we're<00:02:46.230> looking<00:02:46.590> at<00:02:46.680> about

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
it's closed up we're looking at about

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:50.690 
it's closed up we're looking at about
three<00:02:47.430> and<00:02:47.520> a<00:02:47.580> half<00:02:48.020> so<00:02:49.020> personally<00:02:49.740> I<00:02:49.950> think

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
three and a half so personally I think

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.650 
three and a half so personally I think
this<00:02:50.940> is<00:02:51.090> a<00:02:51.120> failure<00:02:51.450> on<00:02:53.210> Victorinox<00:02:54.210> part

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
this is a failure on Victorinox part

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.870 
this is a failure on Victorinox part
especially<00:02:54.960> you<00:02:55.830> know<00:02:55.950> that<00:02:56.280> it's<00:02:56.460> supposed

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
especially you know that it's supposed

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:01.910 
especially you know that it's supposed
to<00:02:57.030> be<00:02:58.430> like<00:02:59.990> 125th<00:03:00.990> year<00:03:01.230> kind<00:03:01.890> of

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
to be like 125th year kind of

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.130 
to be like 125th year kind of
anniversary<00:03:02.190> special<00:03:02.970> or<00:03:03.090> whatever<00:03:03.480> I<00:03:03.810> would

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
anniversary special or whatever I would

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:05.330

think<00:03:04.410> that<00:03:04.530> they<00:03:04.710> would<00:03:04.860> have<00:03:04.950> come<00:03:05.160> out<00:03:05.310> with

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
think that they would have come out with

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.670 
think that they would have come out with
a<00:03:05.520> lot<00:03:05.820> better<00:03:06.060> knife<00:03:06.330> on<00:03:06.600> there<00:03:06.810> you<00:03:07.560> know
