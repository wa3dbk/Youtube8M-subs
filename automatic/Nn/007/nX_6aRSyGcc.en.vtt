have<00:02:59.860> LED<00:03:00.250> flashes<00:03:00.730> as<00:03:00.940> well<00:03:01.420> now<00:03:02.140> you<00:03:02.200> see<00:03:02.440> a

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
have LED flashes as well now you see a

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:04.170 
have LED flashes as well now you see a
nice<00:03:02.620> design<00:03:03.040> down<00:03:03.310> here<00:03:03.520> that's<00:03:03.670> not<00:03:03.910> just

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180 
nice design down here that's not just

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.090 
nice design down here that's not just
for<00:03:04.420> show<00:03:04.720> it's<00:03:05.020> actually<00:03:05.350> fractal<00:03:05.920> antenna

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:06.100 
for show it's actually fractal antenna

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:08.910 
for show it's actually fractal antenna
technology<00:03:06.750> which<00:03:07.750> as<00:03:08.080> I<00:03:08.320> was<00:03:08.440> told<00:03:08.620> will<00:03:08.800> give

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:08.920 
technology which as I was told will give

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.130 
technology which as I was told will give
you<00:03:09.010> maybe<00:03:09.130> about<00:03:09.430> an<00:03:09.550> extra<00:03:09.970> bar<00:03:10.330> of<00:03:10.720> coverage

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:11.140 
you maybe about an extra bar of coverage

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:13.200 
you maybe about an extra bar of coverage
so<00:03:11.320> it's<00:03:11.500> going<00:03:11.650> to<00:03:11.770> boost<00:03:11.980> the<00:03:12.850> antenna

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:13.210 
so it's going to boost the antenna

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:15.270 
so it's going to boost the antenna
within<00:03:13.630> the<00:03:13.750> device<00:03:14.050> so<00:03:15.010> that's<00:03:15.160> actually

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280 
within the device so that's actually

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.460 
within the device so that's actually
kind<00:03:15.970> of<00:03:16.030> cool<00:03:16.210> that<00:03:16.450> they<00:03:16.570> included<00:03:16.870> that<00:03:17.050> so

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470 
kind of cool that they included that so

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:18.630 
kind of cool that they included that so
you'll<00:03:17.620> see<00:03:17.770> right<00:03:17.920> there<00:03:18.040> it's<00:03:18.160> not<00:03:18.250> just<00:03:18.490> the

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:18.640 
you'll see right there it's not just the

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:20.370 
you'll see right there it's not just the
design<00:03:18.940> on<00:03:19.120> the<00:03:19.210> device<00:03:19.420> it's<00:03:20.080> actually

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:20.380 
design on the device it's actually

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:22.080 
design on the device it's actually
functional<00:03:20.650> as<00:03:21.130> well<00:03:21.370> now<00:03:21.550> let's<00:03:21.790> flip<00:03:21.940> it

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090 
functional as well now let's flip it

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:24.000 
functional as well now let's flip it
over<00:03:22.180> on<00:03:22.570> the<00:03:22.810> front<00:03:23.080> some<00:03:23.470> awesome<00:03:23.860> things

over on the front some awesome things
I'm<00:03:24.100> gonna<00:03:24.190> talk<00:03:24.250> about<00:03:24.459> it<00:03:24.610> does<00:03:24.760> have

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:24.990 
I'm gonna talk about it does have

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:27.390 
I'm gonna talk about it does have

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.030 
stabilization in the front-facing camera

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:16.729 
stabilization in the front-facing camera
and<00:04:15.210> finally<00:04:15.720> with<00:04:15.870> the<00:04:15.900> design<00:04:16.290> it<00:04:16.440> does<00:04:16.560> have

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:16.739 
and finally with the design it does have

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:18.860 
and finally with the design it does have
Kevlar<00:04:17.400> on<00:04:17.640> the<00:04:17.790> back<00:04:18.000> so<00:04:18.180> it<00:04:18.269> adds<00:04:18.510> a<00:04:18.690> lot<00:04:18.810> of

Kevlar on the back so it adds a lot of

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:21.410 
Kevlar on the back so it adds a lot of
grip<00:04:19.200> actually<00:04:19.739> it's<00:04:19.829> very<00:04:19.859> easy<00:04:20.160> to<00:04:20.250> hold<00:04:20.519> and

grip actually it's very easy to hold and

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:22.820 
grip actually it's very easy to hold and
it's<00:04:21.570> gonna<00:04:21.660> obviously<00:04:21.930> protect<00:04:22.440> your<00:04:22.590> device

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:22.830
