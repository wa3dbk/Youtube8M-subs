00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.830 
never had bananas before and this was a
very<00:00:25.140> easy<00:00:25.439> way<00:00:25.680> of<00:00:25.830> doing<00:00:26.130> it<00:00:26.279> so<00:00:26.519> had<00:00:27.390> bananas

very easy way of doing it so had bananas
in<00:00:27.960> here<00:00:27.990> and<00:00:28.710> we<00:00:28.800> have<00:00:29.330> apples<00:00:30.330> in<00:00:30.449> here<00:00:30.720> which

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:31.610 
in here and we have apples in here which

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:33.979 
in here and we have apples in here which
apples<00:00:32.610> are<00:00:32.730> not<00:00:32.850> quite<00:00:33.120> smashing<00:00:33.540> up<00:00:33.690> so<00:00:33.840> he's

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
apples are not quite smashing up so he's

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:35.810 
apples are not quite smashing up so he's
mainly<00:00:34.320> just<00:00:34.530> kind<00:00:34.800> of<00:00:34.920> biting<00:00:35.309> and<00:00:35.610> getting

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
mainly just kind of biting and getting

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.940 
mainly just kind of biting and getting
the<00:00:36.059> juice<00:00:36.329> which<00:00:36.660> is<00:00:36.690> okay<00:00:37.110> because<00:00:37.320> he<00:00:37.800> is

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
the juice which is okay because he is

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.600 
the juice which is okay because he is
teething<00:00:38.280> right<00:00:38.579> now<00:00:38.730> so<00:00:39.140> he<00:00:40.140> is<00:00:40.890> just<00:00:41.340> wanting

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
teething right now so he is just wanting

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.670 
teething right now so he is just wanting
to<00:00:41.760> gnaw<00:00:41.910> on<00:00:41.940> something<00:00:42.690> and<00:00:42.899> I<00:00:42.960> think<00:00:43.410> that

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
to gnaw on something and I think that

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.910 
to gnaw on something and I think that
feels<00:00:44.219> good<00:00:44.430> to<00:00:44.579> him<00:00:44.730> probably<00:00:45.030> and<00:00:45.920> so

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
feels good to him probably and so

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.869 
feels good to him probably and so
anyways<00:00:47.250> basically<00:00:48.180> I<00:00:48.899> was<00:00:49.879> unloading

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
anyways basically I was unloading

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.860 
anyways basically I was unloading
groceries<00:00:51.149> and<00:00:51.840> it<00:00:52.469> was<00:00:52.620> time<00:00:52.800> for<00:00:52.829> him<00:00:53.070> to<00:00:53.100> eat

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:53.870 
groceries and it was time for him to eat

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:56.630 
groceries and it was time for him to eat
and<00:00:54.870> the<00:00:55.800> reason<00:00:56.070> why<00:00:56.160> I<00:00:56.190> like<00:00:56.399> these<00:00:56.579> things

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
and the reason why I like these things

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.110 
and the reason why I like these things
so<00:00:56.940> much<00:00:57.120> is<00:00:57.449> because<00:00:57.629> I<00:00:58.609> threw<00:00:59.609> the<00:00:59.730> food<00:00:59.879> in

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
so much is because I threw the food in

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.410 
so much is because I threw the food in
there<00:01:00.300> and<00:01:01.340> went<00:01:02.340> on<00:01:02.460> about<00:01:02.670> what<00:01:03.090> I<00:01:03.120> was<00:01:03.359> doing

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
there and went on about what I was doing

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.440 
there and went on about what I was doing
and<00:01:04.049> I<00:01:04.260> wasn't<00:01:04.650> worried<00:01:04.920> if<00:01:05.400> he<00:01:05.460> was<00:01:05.909> going<00:01:06.240> to

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
and I wasn't worried if he was going to

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:12.260 
and I wasn't worried if he was going to
eat<00:01:07.200> too<00:01:07.380> much<00:01:07.500> at<00:01:07.680> one<00:01:07.860> time<00:01:07.890> or<00:01:11.150> you<00:01:12.150> know
