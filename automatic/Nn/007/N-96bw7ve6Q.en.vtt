the blade on the other one and it still

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.210 
the blade on the other one and it still

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
cut my knuckles as I was trying to you

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.270 
cut my knuckles as I was trying to you
know<00:01:05.339> flip<00:01:05.640> it<00:01:05.760> around<00:01:05.880> and<00:01:06.890> but<00:01:07.890> this<00:01:08.040> however

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
know flip it around and but this however

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.500 
know flip it around and but this however
will<00:01:09.150> not<00:01:09.200> cut<00:01:10.200> your<00:01:10.560> knuckles<00:01:11.010> it<00:01:11.850> will<00:01:12.150> uh

will not cut your knuckles it will uh

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.020 
will not cut your knuckles it will uh
it's<00:01:13.409> impossible<00:01:14.280> as<00:01:14.430> you<00:01:14.549> see<00:01:14.760> right<00:01:15.000> there

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
it's impossible as you see right there

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.420 
it's impossible as you see right there
if<00:01:15.390> you<00:01:15.509> look<00:01:15.689> very<00:01:15.750> very<00:01:16.080> carefully<00:01:16.890> you<00:01:17.280> can

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
if you look very very carefully you can

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.600 
if you look very very carefully you can
see<00:01:17.670> it's<00:01:17.820> a<00:01:17.939> rounded<00:01:18.659> edge<00:01:18.900> right<00:01:19.590> there<00:01:19.650> and

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
see it's a rounded edge right there and

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:21.890 
see it's a rounded edge right there and
you<00:01:20.700> may<00:01:20.820> be<00:01:20.880> wondering<00:01:21.270> why<00:01:21.420> are<00:01:21.450> there<00:01:21.689> holes

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
you may be wondering why are there holes

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.350 
you may be wondering why are there holes
right<00:01:22.560> there<00:01:22.619> two<00:01:23.460> reasons<00:01:23.909> that<00:01:24.000> I

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
right there two reasons that I

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.200 
right there two reasons that I
personally<00:01:24.630> have<00:01:24.840> found<00:01:24.979> one<00:01:25.979> if<00:01:26.880> you<00:01:27.030> notice

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
personally have found one if you notice

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.870 
personally have found one if you notice
with<00:01:27.479> a<00:01:27.509> sharpened<00:01:28.020> blade<00:01:28.350> it's<00:01:28.770> it's<00:01:29.520> more

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
with a sharpened blade it's it's more

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.020 
with a sharpened blade it's it's more
thin<00:01:30.439> and<00:01:31.439> that<00:01:31.590> it<00:01:31.770> that<00:01:31.979> means<00:01:32.220> that<00:01:32.640> it's<00:01:32.909> a

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
thin and that it that means that it's a

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.510 
thin and that it that means that it's a
lighter<00:01:33.360> blade<00:01:33.810> to<00:01:34.500> compensate<00:01:35.159> for<00:01:35.369> the

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
lighter blade to compensate for the

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.789 
lighter blade to compensate for the
thicker<00:01:35.759> blade<00:01:36.150> they<00:01:36.780> popped<00:01:37.079> holes<00:01:37.409> in<00:01:37.619> there

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
thicker blade they popped holes in there

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:41.149 
thicker blade they popped holes in there
plus<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:38.970> holes<00:01:39.390> prevent<00:01:40.320> it<00:01:40.500> from<00:01:40.680> being

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
plus the holes prevent it from being

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.679 
plus the holes prevent it from being
sharpened<00:01:41.640> as<00:01:41.880> you<00:01:42.000> see<00:01:42.180> right<00:01:42.210> there<00:01:42.570> it<00:01:42.659> says

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
sharpened as you see right there it says

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.990 
sharpened as you see right there it says
cannot<00:01:43.259> be<00:01:43.439> sharpened<00:01:43.920> if<00:01:44.159> you<00:01:44.549> were<00:01:44.610> to<00:01:44.729> try

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
cannot be sharpened if you were to try

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.890 
cannot be sharpened if you were to try
to<00:01:45.740> thin

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:46.900 
to thin

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:49.080 
to thin
make<00:01:47.260> this<00:01:47.440> edge<00:01:47.680> nice<00:01:48.040> and<00:01:48.070> thin<00:01:48.520> and<00:01:48.550> sharp

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:49.090 
make this edge nice and thin and sharp

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:51.870 
make this edge nice and thin and sharp
those<00:01:49.600> holes<00:01:50.020> will<00:01:50.410> get<00:01:50.650> in<00:01:50.860> the<00:01:50.980> way<00:01:51.010> so<00:01:51.850> it's

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:51.880 
those holes will get in the way so it's

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:53.790 
those holes will get in the way so it's
impossible<00:01:52.810> for<00:01:53.020> this<00:01:53.140> to<00:01:53.200> actually<00:01:53.470> be

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:53.800 
impossible for this to actually be

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.190 
impossible for this to actually be
sharpened<00:01:54.310> down<00:01:54.490> so<00:01:54.850> if<00:01:54.940> a<00:01:55.030> cop<00:01:55.300> busts<00:01:55.990> you

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:56.200 
sharpened down so if a cop busts you

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.050 
sharpened down so if a cop busts you
with<00:01:56.410> this<00:01:56.620> and<00:01:56.920> he's<00:01:57.460> like<00:01:57.490> hey<00:01:57.790> that's<00:01:57.940> a

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.060 
with this and he's like hey that's a

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:59.880 
with this and he's like hey that's a
butterfly<00:01:58.480> knife<00:01:58.720> it's<00:01:59.050> not<00:01:59.380> it's<00:01:59.680> not<00:01:59.830> a

00:01:59.880 --> 00:01:59.890 
butterfly knife it's not it's not a

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.700 
butterfly knife it's not it's not a
knife<00:02:00.250> per<00:02:00.640> se<00:02:00.880> so<00:02:01.780> let's<00:02:01.960> talk<00:02:02.110> about<00:02:02.170> how<00:02:02.680> it
