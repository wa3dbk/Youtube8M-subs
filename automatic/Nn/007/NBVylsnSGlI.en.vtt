headband I think I'm not sure what she
said<00:00:12.690> I'm<00:00:12.780> gonna<00:00:12.870> ask<00:00:13.080> her<00:00:13.290> in<00:00:13.380> the<00:00:13.469> morning<00:00:13.860> I

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
said I'm gonna ask her in the morning I

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.010 
said I'm gonna ask her in the morning I
mean<00:00:14.070> I<00:00:14.460> don't<00:00:14.519> think<00:00:14.730> I<00:00:14.940> asked<00:00:15.299> her<00:00:15.389> so<00:00:15.990> I

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
mean I don't think I asked her so I

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.230 
mean I don't think I asked her so I
wanna<00:00:16.170> ask<00:00:16.230> if<00:00:17.100> she<00:00:17.310> wants<00:00:17.550> it<00:00:17.580> on<00:00:17.699> a<00:00:17.820> clip<00:00:18.029> or<00:00:18.180> a

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
wanna ask if she wants it on a clip or a

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:24.560 
wanna ask if she wants it on a clip or a
headband<00:00:20.029> this<00:00:21.029> is<00:00:21.210> the<00:00:21.330> correct<00:00:21.660> way<00:00:23.570> because

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
headband this is the correct way because

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.109 
headband this is the correct way because
this<00:00:24.960> piece<00:00:25.260> right<00:00:25.410> here<00:00:25.580> it's<00:00:26.580> facing<00:00:26.910> down

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
this piece right here it's facing down

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.009 
this piece right here it's facing down
so<00:00:27.330> that<00:00:28.260> means<00:00:28.500> that<00:00:28.769> that's<00:00:29.400> the<00:00:29.900> that's<00:00:30.900> the

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
so that means that that's the that's the

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:32.870 
so that means that that's the that's the
always<00:00:31.289> supposed<00:00:31.560> to<00:00:31.590> be<00:00:31.650> facing<00:00:31.859> down<00:00:32.219> so<00:00:32.460> I'm

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
always supposed to be facing down so I'm

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.370 
always supposed to be facing down so I'm
not<00:00:33.000> sure<00:00:33.059> if<00:00:33.300> she<00:00:33.420> wants<00:00:33.450> a<00:00:33.690> bottle<00:00:34.020> cap<00:00:34.200> or

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
not sure if she wants a bottle cap or

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.740
