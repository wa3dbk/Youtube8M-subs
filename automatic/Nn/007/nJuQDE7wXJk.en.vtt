Lindy rig is a sliding sinker rig that
allows<00:00:23.189> the<00:00:23.369> fish<00:00:23.580> to<00:00:23.609> take<00:00:23.880> the<00:00:24.090> bait<00:00:24.269> and

allows the fish to take the bait and
swim<00:00:24.689> with<00:00:24.869> it<00:00:24.900> after<00:00:25.289> it's<00:00:25.410> picked<00:00:25.619> it<00:00:25.769> up<00:00:25.859> so

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
swim with it after it's picked it up so

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.849 
swim with it after it's picked it up so
the<00:00:26.340> fish<00:00:26.550> can<00:00:26.580> pull<00:00:26.970> the<00:00:27.180> line<00:00:27.390> out<00:00:27.859> and

finicky in colored water though I find

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.200 
finicky in colored water though I find
just<00:00:59.100> the<00:00:59.190> opposite<00:00:59.579> is<00:00:59.730> true

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
inches seems to have the better action

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.359 
inches seems to have the better action
because<00:01:07.170> I<00:01:07.290> believe<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.650> fish<00:01:07.830> are<00:01:08.040> hearing

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369
