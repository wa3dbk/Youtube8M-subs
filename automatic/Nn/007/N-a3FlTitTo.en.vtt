freedom to fill in the holes and create
the<00:05:38.709> low-end<00:05:39.639> texture<00:05:40.179> that<00:05:40.449> I<00:05:40.509> can<00:05:40.989> create

00:05:42.229 --> 00:05:42.239 
the low-end texture that I can create

00:05:42.239 --> 00:05:44.399 
the low-end texture that I can create
Nick<00:05:43.239> is<00:05:43.419> a<00:05:43.449> crazy<00:05:43.779> driver

00:05:47.329 --> 00:05:47.339 
I love is play it can really switch from

00:05:47.339 --> 00:05:50.549 
I love is play it can really switch from
physician<00:05:48.339> avant-garde<00:05:49.089> rock<00:05:49.479> and<00:05:50.110> what<00:05:50.529> I

00:05:50.549 --> 00:05:50.559 
physician avant-garde rock and what I

00:05:50.559 --> 00:05:52.429 
physician avant-garde rock and what I
also<00:05:50.889> appreciated<00:05:51.489> a<00:05:51.669> lot<00:05:51.699> was<00:05:52.239> a

00:05:52.429 --> 00:05:52.439 
also appreciated a lot was a

00:05:52.439 --> 00:06:16.420 
also appreciated a lot was a
communication

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:16.430 

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:19.120 

and<00:06:16.550> the<00:06:17.240> compositions<00:06:17.900> themselves<00:06:18.050> are<00:06:18.560> very

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:19.130 
and the compositions themselves are very

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:21.580 
and the compositions themselves are very
complicated<00:06:19.850> but<00:06:20.540> when<00:06:20.840> you<00:06:21.050> play<00:06:21.440> them

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:21.590 
complicated but when you play them

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:23.230 
complicated but when you play them
enough<00:06:21.830> times<00:06:22.130> and<00:06:22.490> break<00:06:22.639> them<00:06:22.820> down<00:06:22.850> an

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:23.240 
enough times and break them down an

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:25.390 
enough times and break them down an
experiment<00:06:23.900> you<00:06:24.139> really<00:06:24.470> you<00:06:24.680> see<00:06:24.949> the

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:25.400 
experiment you really you see the

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:27.400 
experiment you really you see the
simplicity<00:06:25.880> in<00:06:26.210> it<00:06:26.360> and<00:06:26.630> when<00:06:26.870> you<00:06:27.020> try<00:06:27.380> to

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:27.410 
simplicity in it and when you try to

00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:30.460 
simplicity in it and when you try to
focus<00:06:27.860> on<00:06:28.009> that<00:06:28.160> simplicity<00:06:28.750> then<00:06:29.750> the<00:06:30.289> real

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:30.470 
focus on that simplicity then the real

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:32.350 
focus on that simplicity then the real
music<00:06:30.590> starts<00:06:31.100> to<00:06:31.220> happen<00:06:31.580> in<00:06:31.759> connection

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:32.360 
music starts to happen in connection

00:06:32.360 --> 00:07:25.550 
music starts to happen in connection
start

00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:25.560 

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:27.620
