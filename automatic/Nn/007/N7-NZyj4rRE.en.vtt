00:00:23.989 --> 00:00:28.149
This is my computer.

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:33.639
It has a keyboard,

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:42.980
a 19-inch screen,
mouse

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.660
and speakers.

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:53.240
Its hard disk has a capacity of 500 GBs.

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.250
It has wifi connection,

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:01.050
I have the router here.

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.710
I also have a printer.

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:09.990
I also have a laptop

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:13.830
and a tablet.

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:19.110
I use the laptop to work outside home

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:24.300
and the tablet to play games and watch movies.

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.370
Now I'm going to use the computer.

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.490
I turn it on

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:36.770
and the operating system starts.

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:41.810
Then I log in.

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.120
When the operating system is ready,

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:50.240
the desktop appears on the monitor.

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:56.770
Here's the desktop, it has many icons.

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.070
For example,

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.110
here is the recycle bin

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.600
the antivirus,

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:11.810
Media Player,

00:02:13.979 --> 00:02:17.919
My Documents folder

00:02:19.159 --> 00:02:22.619
and My Computer icon.

00:02:23.369 --> 00:02:28.769
The document that I want to modify is
in this USB pen drive.

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:33.719
There are two USB connections here.

00:02:34.559 --> 00:02:39.179
I connect it right here.

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:46.329
I wait a little while and open the folder.

00:02:48.219 --> 00:02:51.799
I have a lot of files.

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:55.759
This is an Excel spreadsheet.

00:02:56.699 --> 00:03:01.269
This is a PPT presentation.

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:05.269
I don't need this file,

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:10.259
I delete it.

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:14.119
I double click on the file.

00:03:14.119 --> 00:03:16.909
First, the text editor opens

00:03:16.909 --> 00:03:21.469
and then the file opens.

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:28.039
I modify the file

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:34.839
and save the changes.

00:03:36.089 --> 00:03:40.029
I make more changes.

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:44.339
I close the file.

00:03:45.439 --> 00:03:48.579
A message appears:

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:53.509
'Do you want to save changes you made to Transcription?'

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:57.199
I click on 'Yes'.

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:59.689
Then I open the browser

00:03:59.689 --> 00:04:05.069
and I check my email.

00:04:19.059 --> 00:04:23.579
My sister has sent me some photos.

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:31.230
I download them in the hard disk

00:04:33.379 --> 00:04:38.979
and save them in My Pictures folder.

00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:43.400
I'm done already.

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:46.980
I close the browser

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:52.299
and turn off the computer.

00:04:55.200 --> 00:05:01.240
