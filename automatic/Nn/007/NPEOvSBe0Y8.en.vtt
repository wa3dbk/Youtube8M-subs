00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 I'll take it for sure you can this pack later 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:07.740
 remove to na'vi already changed some 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.780
 your plans up is a lot 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.130
 change I honestly hoped that it 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.719
 will be originally this way 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.370
 realized again on that he and 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.500
 test tournament to check all 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.840
 as far as we have enough capture points 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.970
 because you know we are playing a storm 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.939
 the essence of the storm itself and we saw once 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.800
 just just on the white park and everything rubs 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.900
 the moment is a cliché in the meantime 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.580
 then decided to aim myself ponastraivat that 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.920
 it was not there to interfere with the start of loading 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:35.010
 yes yes yes, let's see for now 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:37.829
 guys from the virtus.pro team and exit to 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:41.160
 left aggressive defense and not through 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:43.020
 alley let's see really guys so all 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.640
 calculated that the cover from the slide all 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:48.090
 equally knocks her capture clean 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.829
 breaks and basically take a slide and we 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:53.460
 feared someone if i think that this 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:55.920
 the slide is just this at 0 well 0 0 here 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.780
 it's a doctors people why not principle 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.609
 talked about why upper base 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.010
 protection because if protection was on 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:04.860
 another base, then she was happy to zero 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:07.020
 date you take three Fri-shki waffles these 10 with 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.790
 drum and sprinkle spawn 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.560
 then the whole team can go up the hill and 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.299
 just throw shells all this base 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.770
 firing firefly over there 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.720
 wow see work on what i’m talking about 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.700
 said they would work just 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.350
 all your first three minutes four and 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:25.610
 the marriage he gets here 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:29.759
 thats all 2 went to the seizure on 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:30.270
 my and here they saw that there all 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.189
 equipment 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.869
 well they decided to fight they understand that 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.940
 all the same, some kind of plan is 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.440
 virtus.pro tank at least 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:40.119
 54 you can go there capture when 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:42.369
 highlight the overflow squatting 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:45.100
 Still well, let's look far for 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:46.990
 vp guys t 54 went to highlight stb cones 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.880
 two pieces remained the village of heavy and 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:50.500
 little birdie will go back behind you 2 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.210
 went on a hill and basically in the village 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:55.000
 command is located virtus.pro playing 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:58.090
 Protection of GDP for a long time standing there and art 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.920
 can not always forward but also let's 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:01.570
 wait well let's see all the same timer 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.369
 seven minutes is not such a thing i decided i 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:05.140
 I think that it was necessary to fast 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:08.739
 act very will act competently 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:11.680
 navi they never lose hp and 

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:14.800
 The situation is such that they themselves are already 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:17.110
 forced to attack as the base 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:19.900
 lost on not dodge unreal she 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:21.820
 dazzle and wait for it somewhere brilliant 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.640
 team well wait should not do 

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:27.130
 now it's so true to me 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.810
 question and how is virtus.pro going if 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:30.340
 that highlights its base for such 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:31.959
 belly either it will be you out through 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.860
 the village of the whole main strike group 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:34.959
 that is the question 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:37.510
 but most likely it will go to the village 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:39.250
 if seizure begins there by pawn can 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:41.260
 work well really all wound on and 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:43.810
 will be in an open field although there if you take 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:45.400
 this small wood for the base and put 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:47.950
 there it is you and do not fit 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.870
 therefore it was necessary to begin the seizure on and 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:51.579
 In general, what is it necessary to go? 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:52.299
 grab a still yet 

00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:54.280
 we spend 

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:57.549
 frightened look on intelligence that us 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:03:00.640
 it was and all that you get on the hill too 

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:03.519
 very blow that's the one who should 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.370
 defended his lit and after that 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:06.590
 already 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:09.950
 somehow options think about location 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:11.989
 go up at zero no on a 0 b 0 here it is 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:13.790
 such as spending and will not be wonderful 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:16.640
 and here he is a deluxe watch first doing 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:18.680
 pressing on the sixth line checks to the end 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:21.200
 information that in the seven anyone 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:24.019
 no, and the capture was already possible 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:27.319
 Inspector in the meantime gets at 560 

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:28.790
 blow from the hill but the Koreans have not yet 

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:30.489
 lets into its territory yes and 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:33.530
 highlights the hill working on 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:35.390
 maximum well in general is not the point 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:37.340
 that couple is starting to grab guys from 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:39.769
 the na'vi teams still attack them 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:41.810
 either destroy all that is not an option explicitly 

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:43.849
 on the hill there he just does not have this height 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:45.200
 they just need to crush 

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:47.959
 seize the base of everything 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:50.959
 left-hander in capture the first tanks have now 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:54.560
 need to go back to vinh come back 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:57.349
 they put another tank and now 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:59.870
 art for the virtus.pro command would be 

00:03:57.349 --> 00:04:01.760
 such a good gift let's 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:04.250
 Watch what the guys from virtus.pro 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:06.379
 decided to defend in the first round this 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:08.209
 hell playing with slides 2 and dogs three things 

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:10.190
 already pursed to give a clearance and 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:13.519
 Fri-shka will work from a hill 57 heavy 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:15.739
 still in the village and she won base 4 

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:16.750
 the rim is on its way 

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:18.620
 already shot on the slide 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:21.079
 let's see what all can 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:22.700
 end but for now all over there base 

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:24.139
 captured after fifteen seconds will 

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:26.510
 need to act team virtus.pro 

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:28.880
 faster faster faster capture guys 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:31.490
 goes on avi avi all these odds are near 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:33.800
 themselves, they have stopped all these chances but 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:35.690
 look here they got out hop with crying 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:38.060
 500 and 600 rootstocks 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:39.919
 can be isolated and then the same in the 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:42.860
 the center is the same situation this capture 

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:45.380
 resanta it just flooded with shells 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:46.880
 and three tanks team gnp unpleasantly grohl 

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:49.849
 from forces virtus.pro 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:52.550
 go to suicide go go kill 

00:04:49.849 --> 00:04:54.139
 trying to do something is impossible 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:56.750
 impossible here the virtus.pro command 

00:04:54.139 --> 00:04:58.910
 somehow somehow they just 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:01.010
 We decided to play virtus.pro's hope 

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:04.130
 the fact that we make mistakes we do not make mistakes in 

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:05.660
 such a minute and in principle is about to 

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:10.010
 I will bring the matter to a logical conclusion but 

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:13.190
 while getting off of a grab chance minus 10 

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:16.820
 shepherd minutes four tanks from virtus.pro 

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:17.280
 almost all of them remain with na'vi 

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:20.160
 us on 

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:22.500
 more and they go depressed at this time 

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:25.020
 as leksu arrived guests and artillery 

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:27.000
 problems will now we will see how 

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:28.740
 Gypsum will lose the team yet he pro 

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.139
 it does not know but also knows already received 

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:33.380
 backslide slide against paul 1st not 

00:05:31.139 --> 00:05:36.600
 wins a bubble it connects 

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:38.580
 10 per shows just level minus 

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:41.100
 art minus stb-1 from virtus.pro but 

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:43.470
 76 kpc marriage remains and it does not remain 

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:45.840
 already in a quick take it and Korean 

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:48.270
 the last captain-commander to what they saw 

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:51.540
 Yes, he took Artoo fulovy fellow 

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:55.080
 of course but further though wait minutes 

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:57.750
 at 38 like strike full but of course 

00:05:55.080 --> 00:06:01.620
 crush crush just crush such chances 

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:04.830
 Do not miss this game which was 

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:06.750
 shown by the team nadi this is chic 

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:09.960
 chic way the na'vi team is now 

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:13.020
 playing back friends I remind you that glasses 

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:15.000
 in the test championship are considered by two 

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:16.830
 cardboard, that is, no matter how you play 

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:20.490
 one card is important how you play in the amount 

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:22.979
 2 that is, we have 4 rounds in two 

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:25.560
 Cards That is, the sum of 8 you need to win 5 

00:06:22.979 --> 00:06:27.330
 that is, you can win 1 card 40 for 2 

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:31.580
 take only the first fight 50 you have enough 

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:31.580
 to win in the case even before 4
