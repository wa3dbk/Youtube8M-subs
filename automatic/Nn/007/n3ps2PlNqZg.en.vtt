00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
wanted to keep it or not I don't think

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.099 
wanted to keep it or not I don't think
that<00:00:59.910> was<00:01:00.000> the<00:01:00.030> right<00:01:00.149> way<00:01:00.539> to<00:01:00.600> go<00:01:00.750> about<00:01:00.870> this

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
that was the right way to go about this

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:02.420 
that was the right way to go about this
I'm<00:01:01.500> going<00:01:01.620> to<00:01:01.710> call<00:01:01.859> the<00:01:02.010> number<00:01:02.219> on<00:01:02.250> the<00:01:02.340> card

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
I'm going to call the number on the card

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.910 
I'm going to call the number on the card
and<00:01:02.879> try<00:01:03.090> to<00:01:03.149> get<00:01:03.359> this<00:01:03.570> sorted<00:01:04.080> out<00:01:04.229> now<00:01:04.530> it

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
and try to get this sorted out now it

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.010 
and try to get this sorted out now it
looks<00:01:05.040> like<00:01:05.189> a<00:01:05.280> relatively<00:01:05.820> old<00:01:06.150> drone<00:01:06.689> based

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
looks like a relatively old drone based

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.260 
looks like a relatively old drone based
on<00:01:07.200> the<00:01:07.290> pictures<00:01:07.680> here<00:01:08.159> but<00:01:08.820> it's<00:01:09.030> definitely

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
on the pictures here but it's definitely

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.359 
on the pictures here but it's definitely
federal<00:01:09.990> property<00:01:10.530> and<00:01:10.770> it's<00:01:11.100> pretty

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
federal property and it's pretty

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.109 
federal property and it's pretty
expensive<00:01:11.820> so<00:01:13.070> thankfully<00:01:14.070> this<00:01:14.580> guy<00:01:14.790> didn't

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
expensive so thankfully this guy didn't

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:16.969 
expensive so thankfully this guy didn't
decide<00:01:15.390> to<00:01:15.450> just<00:01:15.810> keep<00:01:16.049> this<00:01:16.259> drone<00:01:16.560> and<00:01:16.799> hang

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
decide to just keep this drone and hang

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.899 
decide to just keep this drone and hang
on<00:01:17.189> to<00:01:17.430> it<00:01:17.549> but<00:01:18.150> it<00:01:18.390> causes<00:01:18.689> pause<00:01:19.140> that<00:01:19.560> like

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:19.909 
on to it but it causes pause that like

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:22.730 
on to it but it causes pause that like
what<00:01:20.909> other<00:01:21.119> kind<00:01:21.540> of<00:01:21.689> expensive<00:01:22.229> pieces<00:01:22.590> of

major damage UPS definitely dropped the
ball<00:01:49.200> on<00:01:49.259> this<00:01:49.530> one<00:01:49.740> but<00:01:50.100> what<00:01:50.250> do<00:01:50.340> you<00:01:50.369> expect

with that many packages going in and out
here's<00:01:54.270> my<00:01:54.329> idea<00:01:54.840> don't<00:01:55.470> ship<00:01:55.710> four<00:01:55.950> hundred

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
here's my idea don't ship four hundred

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.219 
here's my idea don't ship four hundred
thousand<00:01:56.549> dollar<00:01:56.670> drones<00:01:57.119> through<00:01:57.450> UPS<00:01:57.960> if

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
thousand dollar drones through UPS if

00:01:58.229 --> 00:01:59.959 
thousand dollar drones through UPS if
you<00:01:58.350> want<00:01:58.560> them<00:01:58.680> to<00:01:58.770> get<00:01:58.920> to<00:01:59.070> one<00:01:59.250> pleat<00:01:59.549> in<00:01:59.729> one

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
you want them to get to one pleat in one

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.760 
you want them to get to one pleat in one
piece<00:02:00.210> separately<00:02:00.630> because<00:02:01.259> they<00:02:01.439> might<00:02:01.590> end

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
piece separately because they might end

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.069 
piece separately because they might end
up<00:02:01.860> on<00:02:02.040> the<00:02:02.130> floor<00:02:02.159> of<00:02:02.490> a<00:02:02.579> UPS<00:02:03.030> and<00:02:03.360> on<00:02:03.869> an
