00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:07.520 

that's<00:02:05.190> the<00:02:05.310> stance<00:02:05.580> I'm<00:02:05.760> going<00:02:06.090> for<00:02:06.530> that's

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
that's the stance I'm going for that's

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.410 
that's the stance I'm going for that's
the<00:02:07.860> front<00:02:08.130> tire<00:02:08.369> sitting<00:02:08.850> up<00:02:09.000> on<00:02:09.149> the<00:02:09.270> inner

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.440 
the front tire sitting up on the inner
hood<00:02:09.690> so<00:02:10.560> it's<00:02:10.740> going<00:02:10.860> to<00:02:10.920> be<00:02:11.070> just<00:02:11.700> up<00:02:12.150> from

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
hood so it's going to be just up from

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.010 
hood so it's going to be just up from
that<00:02:13.550> I'm<00:02:14.550> almost<00:02:15.090> thinking<00:02:15.360> about<00:02:15.840> like

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
that I'm almost thinking about like

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:20.570 
that I'm almost thinking about like
making<00:02:16.790> this<00:02:17.790> is<00:02:18.000> homemade<00:02:18.720> suspension<00:02:19.580> with

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
making this is homemade suspension with

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:25.040 
making this is homemade suspension with
no<00:02:20.820> spring<00:02:21.360> that<00:02:21.630> will<00:02:21.810> drop<00:02:22.170> and<00:02:23.750> so<00:02:24.750> like

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
no spring that will drop and so like

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:26.570 
no spring that will drop and so like
when<00:02:25.230> you<00:02:25.320> lift<00:02:25.530> it<00:02:25.650> up<00:02:25.770> it'll<00:02:26.130> do<00:02:26.400> like<00:02:26.550> a

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
when you lift it up it'll do like a

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.449 
when you lift it up it'll do like a
90/10<00:02:27.120> shock<00:02:27.480> and<00:02:27.840> it'll<00:02:28.830> just<00:02:29.070> the<00:02:29.250> front

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
90/10 shock and it'll just the front

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:32.840 
90/10 shock and it'll just the front
will<00:02:29.640> raise<00:02:29.820> up<00:02:30.090> and<00:02:30.980> or<00:02:31.980> set<00:02:32.280> it<00:02:32.400> so<00:02:32.550> you<00:02:32.610> can

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
will raise up and or set it so you can

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:35.720 
will raise up and or set it so you can
yeah<00:02:33.240> you<00:02:33.480> know<00:02:33.660> have<00:02:34.320> it<00:02:34.350> up<00:02:34.620> or<00:02:34.860> down<00:02:35.100> so<00:02:35.130> if<00:02:35.640> I

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
tires you're gonna end up moving back

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:55.580 
tires you're gonna end up moving back
out<00:02:51.050> if<00:02:52.050> you<00:02:52.110> can<00:02:52.560> see<00:02:53.220> in<00:02:53.400> there<00:02:54.200> that<00:02:55.200> one's<00:02:55.470> a

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
out if you can see in there that one's a

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.170 
out if you can see in there that one's a
little<00:02:55.800> off<00:02:55.980> but<00:02:56.280> that<00:02:56.310> one's<00:02:56.670> almost<00:02:56.850> about

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
little off but that one's almost about

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.650 
little off but that one's almost about
right<00:02:57.390> where<00:02:57.570> it's<00:02:57.690> gonna<00:02:57.810> be<00:02:58.520> I<00:02:59.520> was<00:03:00.330> thinking

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
right where it's gonna be I was thinking

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:03.830 
right where it's gonna be I was thinking
about<00:03:00.750> doing<00:03:01.200> that<00:03:01.320> the<00:03:01.560> baby<00:03:01.920> seat<00:03:02.280> tub<00:03:02.840> I've

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
the tires to get it to sit right so that

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:28.100 
the tires to get it to sit right so that
is<00:03:25.950> the<00:03:26.220> stance<00:03:26.549> each<00:03:27.120> front<00:03:27.570> and<00:03:27.720> back<00:03:27.870> is

is the stance each front and back is

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:31.220 
is the stance each front and back is
gonna<00:03:28.290> go<00:03:28.500> up<00:03:28.709> maybe<00:03:29.040> a<00:03:29.190> centimeter<00:03:29.959> maybe<00:03:30.959> ten

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
gonna go up maybe a centimeter maybe ten

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:34.610 
gonna go up maybe a centimeter maybe ten
thousandth<00:03:31.709> of<00:03:31.769> an<00:03:31.920> inch<00:03:32.720> so<00:03:33.720> but<00:03:34.260> that<00:03:34.440> is

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
thousandth of an inch so but that is

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:40.009 
thousandth of an inch so but that is
pretty<00:03:34.890> much<00:03:35.780> just<00:03:36.780> sittin<00:03:37.500> where<00:03:38.160> I<00:03:38.220> want<00:03:39.019> and
