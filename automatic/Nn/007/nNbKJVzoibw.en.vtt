00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
to make more money on this thing than

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.139 
to make more money on this thing than
you<00:00:55.289> could<00:00:55.800> possibly<00:00:55.829> imagine<00:00:56.309> it's<00:00:56.940> going<00:00:57.090> to

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
you could possibly imagine it's going to

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:58.910 
you could possibly imagine it's going to
make<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.390> 5d<00:00:57.809> mark<00:00:58.020> two<00:00:58.079> look<00:00:58.410> like<00:00:58.530> it<00:00:58.710> didn't

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
make the 5d mark two look like it didn't

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.880 
make the 5d mark two look like it didn't
even<00:00:59.070> sell<00:00:59.370> and<00:01:00.320> basically<00:01:01.320> what<00:01:01.500> you<00:01:01.620> need<00:01:01.770> to

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
even sell and basically what you need to

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.479 
even sell and basically what you need to
do<00:01:02.039> is<00:01:02.809> the<00:01:03.809> sensor<00:01:04.199> needs<00:01:04.350> to<00:01:04.530> be<00:01:04.650> around<00:01:04.890> 28

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
do is the sensor needs to be around 28

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.100 
do is the sensor needs to be around 28
to<00:01:05.670> 32<00:01:06.000> megapixels<00:01:07.610> 32<00:01:08.610> would<00:01:08.760> be<00:01:08.880> great<00:01:09.210> but

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
to 32 megapixels 32 would be great but

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.770 
to 32 megapixels 32 would be great but
it<00:01:10.409> needs<00:01:10.710> to<00:01:10.830> be<00:01:10.920> 28<00:01:11.400> to<00:01:11.549> 32<00:01:11.850> megapixels

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
it needs to be 28 to 32 megapixels

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.560 
it needs to be 28 to 32 megapixels
without<00:01:13.610> sacrificing<00:01:14.610> image<00:01:14.939> quality<00:01:15.180> what

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
without sacrificing image quality what

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.260 
without sacrificing image quality what
we<00:01:15.720> need<00:01:15.900> to<00:01:16.049> see<00:01:16.320> is<00:01:16.560> two<00:01:17.460> stops<00:01:17.850> would<00:01:18.150> be

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
we need to see is two stops would be

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.660 
we need to see is two stops would be
nice<00:01:18.509> of<00:01:18.810> height<00:01:19.229> better<00:01:19.560> I<00:01:19.770> high<00:01:20.070> ISO

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
nice of height better I high ISO

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.980 
nice of height better I high ISO
performance<00:01:21.360> compared<00:01:22.170> to<00:01:22.380> the<00:01:22.619> 5d<00:01:23.189> mark<00:01:23.460> two

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:23.990 
performance compared to the 5d mark two

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:27.980 
performance compared to the 5d mark two
if<00:01:24.990> you<00:01:25.619> go<00:01:25.770> 32<00:01:26.280> megapixels<00:01:27.000> and<00:01:27.180> you<00:01:27.600> get<00:01:27.750> two

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
if you go 32 megapixels and you get two

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.170 
if you go 32 megapixels and you get two
stops<00:01:28.380> I<00:01:28.619> think<00:01:29.189> the<00:01:29.280> technology<00:01:29.640> is<00:01:29.970> there<00:01:30.030> to

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
stops I think the technology is there to

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.210 
stops I think the technology is there to
do<00:01:30.479> it<00:01:30.659> we're<00:01:31.259> seeing<00:01:31.530> some<00:01:31.710> amazing<00:01:32.189> things

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
do it we're seeing some amazing things

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.240 
do it we're seeing some amazing things
out<00:01:32.670> of<00:01:32.700> the<00:01:32.790> nikon<00:01:33.180> d3s<00:01:33.900> so<00:01:34.650> you<00:01:34.710> should<00:01:35.220> be

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
out of the nikon d3s so you should be

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.760 
out of the nikon d3s so you should be
able<00:01:35.430> to<00:01:35.610> pull<00:01:35.790> that<00:01:36.000> off<00:01:36.030> if<00:01:36.570> you<00:01:37.140> can't<00:01:37.170> i

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
able to pull that off if you can't i

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.620 
able to pull that off if you can't i
would<00:01:37.979> suggest<00:01:38.189> keeping<00:01:38.640> it<00:01:38.909> at<00:01:39.030> twenty<00:01:39.479> eight

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
would suggest keeping it at twenty eight

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.109 
would suggest keeping it at twenty eight
megapixels<00:01:40.439> and<00:01:40.590> still<00:01:41.490> maintaining<00:01:41.909> your

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
megapixels and still maintaining your

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.719 
megapixels and still maintaining your
two<00:01:42.390> stops<00:01:42.780> of<00:01:43.159> improved<00:01:44.159> high<00:01:44.369> so

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
two stops of improved high so

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.710 
two stops of improved high so
performance<00:01:45.329> the<00:01:46.880> autofocus<00:01:47.880> and<00:01:48.210> the<00:01:48.420> body

in<00:02:06.869> it<00:02:06.990> and<00:02:07.170> you<00:02:07.200> got<00:02:07.740> a<00:02:07.799> winner<00:02:08.129> right<00:02:08.250> there

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
in it and you got a winner right there

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.820 
in it and you got a winner right there
the<00:02:09.360> only<00:02:09.509> thing<00:02:09.720> i<00:02:09.840> would<00:02:09.899> do<00:02:10.170> to<00:02:10.410> that<00:02:10.440> body

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
the only thing i would do to that body

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.490 
the only thing i would do to that body
is<00:02:11.129> add<00:02:11.400> duel<00:02:11.910> card<00:02:12.360> slots

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
is add duel card slots

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:19.130 
is add duel card slots
and<00:02:15.800> for<00:02:16.800> video<00:02:17.190> we'd<00:02:17.970> like<00:02:18.120> to<00:02:18.270> see<00:02:18.570> the

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
and for video we'd like to see the

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.280 
and for video we'd like to see the
edition<00:02:19.680> of<00:02:19.880> raw<00:02:20.880> video<00:02:21.360> if<00:02:21.660> that's<00:02:21.960> possible

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
edition of raw video if that's possible

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.110 
edition of raw video if that's possible
I<00:02:22.830> do<00:02:23.070> know<00:02:23.250> that<00:02:23.280> that's<00:02:23.640> going<00:02:23.880> to<00:02:23.940> mean

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
I do know that that's going to mean

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.610 
I do know that that's going to mean
probably<00:02:24.780> some<00:02:25.110> output<00:02:25.650> to<00:02:27.140> some<00:02:28.140> hard<00:02:28.380> drives

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
probably some output to some hard drives

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.440 
probably some output to some hard drives
because<00:02:29.190> raw<00:02:29.460> video<00:02:29.820> is<00:02:30.000> going<00:02:30.150> to<00:02:30.240> eat<00:02:30.420> up

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
because raw video is going to eat up

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:35.060 
because raw video is going to eat up
memory<00:02:30.990> like<00:02:31.200> crazy<00:02:31.740> so<00:02:32.550> if<00:02:33.510> raw<00:02:34.410> video<00:02:34.800> is<00:02:34.920> not

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070 
memory like crazy so if raw video is not

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:39.410 
memory like crazy so if raw video is not
possible<00:02:35.370> or<00:02:35.850> as<00:02:36.150> an<00:02:36.709> alternative<00:02:37.709> or<00:02:38.010> a<00:02:38.420> extra

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
possible or as an alternative or a extra

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.949 
possible or as an alternative or a extra
settings<00:02:39.930> we'd<00:02:40.440> like<00:02:40.590> to<00:02:40.770> see<00:02:40.980> 2k<00:02:41.490> or<00:02:41.700> 4k<00:02:41.959> video

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
settings we'd like to see 2k or 4k video

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:45.470 
settings we'd like to see 2k or 4k video
even<00:02:43.650> just<00:02:43.860> to<00:02:44.100> K<00:02:44.340> would<00:02:44.550> be<00:02:44.700> a<00:02:44.730> nice<00:02:44.940> step<00:02:45.270> up

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
even just to K would be a nice step up

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.470 
even just to K would be a nice step up
from<00:02:45.720> the<00:02:46.320> what<00:02:47.070> we<00:02:47.190> have<00:02:47.340> now<00:02:47.640> be<00:02:48.270> able<00:02:48.330> to

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
from the what we have now be able to

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:49.820 
from the what we have now be able to
give<00:02:48.690> us<00:02:48.810> that<00:02:48.959> really<00:02:49.320> nice<00:02:49.470> tight

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
give us that really nice tight

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:53.990 
give us that really nice tight
resolution<00:02:50.610> so<00:02:51.500> basically<00:02:52.500> that's<00:02:52.620> it<00:02:52.920> 28<00:02:53.880> to

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
resolution so basically that's it 28 to

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.720 
resolution so basically that's it 28 to
32<00:02:54.300> megapixel<00:02:55.020> sensor<00:02:55.410> two<00:02:56.220> stops<00:02:56.489> better

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
32 megapixel sensor two stops better

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.699 
32 megapixel sensor two stops better
high<00:02:56.940> so<00:02:57.360> performance<00:02:57.959> than<00:02:58.110> the<00:02:58.200> Canon<00:02:58.470> 5d

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
high so performance than the Canon 5d

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:01.430 
high so performance than the Canon 5d
Mark<00:02:58.890> to<00:02:59.280> give<00:03:00.000> us<00:03:00.120> the<00:03:00.270> 70<00:03:00.780> body<00:03:01.050> the

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
Mark to give us the 70 body the

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.800 
Mark to give us the 70 body the
autofocus<00:03:01.890> system<00:03:02.100> in<00:03:02.489> the<00:03:02.580> body<00:03:02.760> give<00:03:03.480> us<00:03:03.630> the

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
autofocus system in the body give us the

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:07.220 
autofocus system in the body give us the
dual<00:03:04.020> card<00:03:04.410> slots<00:03:04.739> and<00:03:06.080> give<00:03:07.080> us<00:03:07.200> some

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
dual card slots and give us some

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.440 
dual card slots and give us some
enhancements<00:03:07.890> on<00:03:08.010> the<00:03:08.130> video<00:03:08.459> the<00:03:09.060> video<00:03:09.270> is

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
enhancements on the video the video is

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:11.090 
enhancements on the video the video is
already<00:03:09.630> doing<00:03:09.959> really<00:03:10.170> good<00:03:10.440> in<00:03:10.500> that<00:03:10.650> regard

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100 
already doing really good in that regard

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:14.479 
already doing really good in that regard
anyways<00:03:11.700> but<00:03:12.239> we'd<00:03:12.420> like<00:03:12.570> to<00:03:12.750> see<00:03:12.989> 2<00:03:13.260> k<00:03:13.560> for<00:03:14.310> k

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:14.489 
anyways but we'd like to see 2 k for k

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:16.520 
anyways but we'd like to see 2 k for k
if<00:03:14.550> we<00:03:14.760> can<00:03:14.940> do<00:03:15.060> it<00:03:15.209> and<00:03:15.330> raw<00:03:15.690> video<00:03:16.110> that'd<00:03:16.410> be

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
if we can do it and raw video that'd be

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.340 
if we can do it and raw video that'd be
great<00:03:16.739> so<00:03:17.209> that's<00:03:18.209> it<00:03:18.390> can<00:03:18.660> that's<00:03:19.110> how<00:03:19.320> you
