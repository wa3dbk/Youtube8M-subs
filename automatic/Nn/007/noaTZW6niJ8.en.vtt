00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
thought I would get this skinny habitat

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.230 
thought I would get this skinny habitat
and<00:01:13.890> then<00:01:14.280> M<00:01:14.700> if<00:01:15.560> it<00:01:16.560> is<00:01:17.009> okay<00:01:17.580> obviously<00:01:18.000> I

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
and then M if it is okay obviously I

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.550 
and then M if it is okay obviously I
know<00:01:18.330> it's<00:01:18.540> too<00:01:18.659> small<00:01:18.900> for<00:01:19.049> the<00:01:19.140> herd<00:01:19.290> I'm<00:01:19.439> not

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
know it's too small for the herd I'm not

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.410 
know it's too small for the herd I'm not
squeezing<00:01:19.830> them<00:01:20.009> all<00:01:20.130> in<00:01:20.280> there<00:01:20.460> but<00:01:21.150> if<00:01:21.240> it's

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
squeezing them all in there but if it's

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.359 
squeezing them all in there but if it's
an<00:01:21.509> okay<00:01:21.780> size<00:01:21.990> I<00:01:22.259> will<00:01:22.500> buy<00:01:22.619> one<00:01:22.650> or<00:01:23.009> two<00:01:23.130> more

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
an okay size I will buy one or two more

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.910 
an okay size I will buy one or two more
and<00:01:23.430> expand<00:01:24.060> it<00:01:24.240> and<00:01:24.500> while<00:01:25.500> I'm<00:01:25.650> waiting<00:01:25.770> for

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
and expand it and while I'm waiting for

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.819 
and expand it and while I'm waiting for
those<00:01:26.070> to<00:01:26.250> come<00:01:26.280> and<00:01:27.080> I<00:01:28.080> am<00:01:28.200> going<00:01:28.439> to<00:01:28.500> expand

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
those to come and I am going to expand

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:32.569 
those to come and I am going to expand
it<00:01:29.060> myself<00:01:30.060> with<00:01:30.630> M<00:01:31.110> the<00:01:32.009> grids<00:01:32.280> that<00:01:32.490> we

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
it myself with M the grids that we

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.179 
it myself with M the grids that we
already<00:01:32.700> have<00:01:33.530> until<00:01:34.530> I<00:01:34.619> buy<00:01:34.770> them<00:01:34.920> their<00:01:35.070> own

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
already have until I buy them their own

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.969 
already have until I buy them their own
CSD<00:01:35.579> cage<00:01:35.869> so<00:01:36.869> the<00:01:37.259> reason<00:01:37.530> why<00:01:37.650> I<00:01:37.680> was<00:01:37.799> doing

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
CSD cage so the reason why I was doing

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.140 
CSD cage so the reason why I was doing
this<00:01:38.040> rather<00:01:38.220> than<00:01:38.430> taking<00:01:38.579> cages<00:01:39.000> well

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
this rather than taking cages well

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.600 
this rather than taking cages well
obviously<00:01:39.270> I'm<00:01:40.170> moving<00:01:40.680> and<00:01:40.950> the<00:01:41.130> last<00:01:41.340> things

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
obviously I'm moving and the last things

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.399 
obviously I'm moving and the last things
I<00:01:41.759> have<00:01:41.909> to<00:01:42.030> take<00:01:42.150> with<00:01:42.299> me<00:01:42.360> the<00:01:42.540> better<00:01:42.720> so<00:01:43.170> I'm

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
I have to take with me the better so I'm

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.889 
I have to take with me the better so I'm
saving<00:01:44.310> space<00:01:44.520> on<00:01:44.670> cage<00:01:44.880> and<00:01:45.119> three-level

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
saving space on cage and three-level

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.300 
saving space on cage and three-level
cage<00:01:46.079> that<00:01:46.290> we<00:01:46.380> have<00:01:46.649> I<00:01:46.829> just<00:01:47.009> don't<00:01:47.159> think

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
cage that we have I just don't think

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.030 
cage that we have I just don't think
would<00:01:47.549> be<00:01:47.640> suitable<00:01:47.909> for<00:01:48.030> and<00:01:48.479> I<00:01:49.470> heard

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
would be suitable for and I heard

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.490 
would be suitable for and I heard
because<00:01:50.399> the<00:01:51.299> where<00:01:51.630> the<00:01:51.840> holes<00:01:52.049> are<00:01:52.259> for<00:01:52.439> the

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
because the where the holes are for the

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.179 
because the where the holes are for the
ramps<00:01:52.740> are<00:01:52.860> just<00:01:53.100> isn't<00:01:53.899> good<00:01:54.899> for<00:01:55.259> space<00:01:55.530> so

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
ramps are just isn't good for space so

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.010 
ramps are just isn't good for space so
anyway<00:01:56.460> I'm<00:01:56.640> going<00:01:56.670> to<00:01:56.820> open<00:01:57.000> up<00:01:57.270> this<00:01:57.420> box<00:01:57.719> and

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
anyway I'm going to open up this box and

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.800 
anyway I'm going to open up this box and
put<00:01:58.350> it<00:01:58.380> together<00:01:58.530> and<00:01:58.850> show<00:01:59.850> you<00:01:59.909> I'll<00:02:00.689> let

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
put it together and show you I'll let

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.510 
put it together and show you I'll let
you<00:02:00.930> know<00:02:00.960> I<00:02:01.049> think<00:02:01.229> and<00:02:01.799> how<00:02:01.979> easy<00:02:02.159> it<00:02:02.340> is<00:02:02.369> to

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
you know I think and how easy it is to

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:03.679 
you know I think and how easy it is to
put<00:02:02.670> together<00:02:02.790> and<00:02:03.180> all<00:02:03.270> these<00:02:03.390> kind<00:02:03.659> of

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
put together and all these kind of

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.440 
put together and all these kind of
things<00:02:03.750> and<00:02:04.140> the<00:02:04.890> box<00:02:05.159> is<00:02:05.430> a<00:02:05.700> lot<00:02:05.909> tighter<00:02:06.180> and

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
things and the box is a lot tighter and

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.529 
things and the box is a lot tighter and
I<00:02:06.540> thought<00:02:06.659> it<00:02:06.810> would<00:02:06.960> be<00:02:07.079> so<00:02:07.409> I'm<00:02:07.680> hoping<00:02:07.950> it

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:08.539 
I thought it would be so I'm hoping it

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:13.440 
I thought it would be so I'm hoping it
isn't<00:02:09.539> a<00:02:09.599> tiny<00:02:09.840> cage<00:02:10.170> and<00:02:10.500> we'll<00:02:11.099> hopefully

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.809 

not<00:02:13.840> be<00:02:14.020> too<00:02:14.200> flimsy<00:02:14.470> so<00:02:14.860> I'll<00:02:15.340> catch<00:02:15.520> you<00:02:15.670> in<00:02:15.760> a

00:02:15.809 --> 00:02:15.819 
not be too flimsy so I'll catch you in a

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:19.050 
not be too flimsy so I'll catch you in a
moment<00:02:16.270> and<00:02:16.980> very<00:02:17.980> quickly<00:02:18.160> before<00:02:18.640> they<00:02:18.790> sort

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
moment and very quickly before they sort

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:20.670 
moment and very quickly before they sort
of<00:02:19.239> damage<00:02:19.690> the<00:02:19.810> box<00:02:19.989> Wrentham<00:02:20.440> like<00:02:20.530> that

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
of damage the box Wrentham like that

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.620 
of damage the box Wrentham like that
this<00:02:20.920> is<00:02:21.069> what<00:02:21.280> it<00:02:21.430> should<00:02:21.459> look<00:02:21.670> kind<00:02:22.180> of<00:02:22.270> all

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
this is what it should look kind of all

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:25.170 
this is what it should look kind of all
built<00:02:23.349> up<00:02:23.500> and<00:02:23.739> it<00:02:24.220> does<00:02:24.520> say<00:02:24.760> that<00:02:24.790> it<00:02:24.970> would

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
built up and it does say that it would

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.210 
built up and it does say that it would
be<00:02:25.209> 8<00:02:25.480> square<00:02:25.900> feet<00:02:26.200> so<00:02:26.500> that's<00:02:26.650> kind<00:02:27.040> of<00:02:27.069> good

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
be 8 square feet so that's kind of good

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:28.680 
be 8 square feet so that's kind of good
for<00:02:27.459> two<00:02:27.670> guinea<00:02:27.880> pigs<00:02:28.150> if<00:02:28.300> that's<00:02:28.450> all<00:02:28.569> you

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
for two guinea pigs if that's all you

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:31.580 
for two guinea pigs if that's all you
had<00:02:28.870> and<00:02:29.080> there<00:02:29.770> you<00:02:29.890> can<00:02:30.010> see<00:02:30.069> up<00:02:30.310> the<00:02:30.459> top<00:02:30.489> and

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
had and there you can see up the top and

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.260 
had and there you can see up the top and
that's<00:02:32.590> how<00:02:32.920> can<00:02:33.220> you<00:02:33.310> how<00:02:33.580> you<00:02:33.640> would<00:02:33.819> expand

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:34.270 
that's how can you how you would expand

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:36.360 
that's how can you how you would expand
it<00:02:34.510> and<00:02:34.660> kind<00:02:35.140> of<00:02:35.260> you<00:02:35.770> know<00:02:35.860> go<00:02:36.100> around<00:02:36.160> the

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
it and kind of you know go around the

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:39.420 
it and kind of you know go around the
corner<00:02:36.700> or<00:02:36.790> whatever<00:02:36.910> and<00:02:37.470> yeah<00:02:38.470> so<00:02:39.100> the<00:02:39.250> doors

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
corner or whatever and yeah so the doors

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.490 
corner or whatever and yeah so the doors
lock<00:02:39.610> in<00:02:39.790> place<00:02:40.090> and<00:02:40.480> there's<00:02:40.630> ramps<00:02:41.050> and<00:02:41.200> all

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
lock in place and there's ramps and all

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.259 
lock in place and there's ramps and all
these<00:02:41.650> kind<00:02:41.860> of<00:02:41.890> things<00:02:42.069> if<00:02:42.220> you<00:02:42.280> expand<00:02:42.610> it<00:02:42.730> so

00:02:43.259 --> 00:02:43.269 
these kind of things if you expand it so

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:45.210 
these kind of things if you expand it so
if<00:02:43.780> I<00:02:43.900> had<00:02:44.019> to<00:02:44.110> show<00:02:44.230> you<00:02:44.290> that<00:02:44.530> in<00:02:44.769> case<00:02:45.040> I

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
if I had to show you that in case I

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:47.720 
if I had to show you that in case I
damaged<00:02:45.610> the<00:02:45.730> box<00:02:45.940> and<00:02:46.150> can't<00:02:46.390> show<00:02:46.510> you<00:02:46.569> again

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
damaged the box and can't show you again

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:49.740 
damaged the box and can't show you again
okay<00:02:48.730> so<00:02:48.790> this<00:02:48.970> is<00:02:49.090> really<00:02:49.300> handy<00:02:49.450> when<00:02:49.660> you

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
okay so this is really handy when you

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:51.809 
okay so this is really handy when you
take<00:02:49.930> it<00:02:50.050> out<00:02:50.110> the<00:02:50.260> box<00:02:50.470> and<00:02:50.830> you<00:02:51.580> get<00:02:51.700> your

00:02:51.809 --> 00:02:51.819 
take it out the box and you get your

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:55.020 
take it out the box and you get your
canvas<00:02:52.239> base<00:02:52.450> and<00:02:52.810> you're<00:02:53.680> a<00:02:53.709> kid<00:02:53.950> of<00:02:54.069> grids<00:02:54.700> or

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
canvas base and you're a kid of grids or

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:56.789 
canvas base and you're a kid of grids or
cage<00:02:55.690> whatever<00:02:56.110> you<00:02:56.200> like<00:02:56.350> to<00:02:56.470> call<00:02:56.500> it<00:02:56.650> and

00:02:56.789 --> 00:02:56.799 
cage whatever you like to call it and

00:02:56.799 --> 00:02:58.620 
cage whatever you like to call it and
instructions<00:02:57.310> and<00:02:57.519> I<00:02:58.000> just<00:02:58.239> noticed<00:02:58.540> I

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:58.630 
instructions and I just noticed I

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:59.970 
instructions and I just noticed I
couldn't<00:02:58.840> understand<00:02:59.200> why<00:02:59.319> on<00:02:59.470> the<00:02:59.590> back<00:02:59.739> of

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
couldn't understand why on the back of

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.580 
couldn't understand why on the back of
the<00:03:00.130> box<00:03:00.310> there<00:03:00.640> was<00:03:00.790> a<00:03:01.030> outdoor<00:03:01.660> run<00:03:01.900> but

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
the box there was a outdoor run but

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:04.140 
the box there was a outdoor run but
obviously<00:03:02.950> if<00:03:03.010> you<00:03:03.130> buy<00:03:03.310> the<00:03:03.370> cage<00:03:03.700> with<00:03:04.120> the

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.150 
obviously if you buy the cage with the

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:05.550 
obviously if you buy the cage with the
lid<00:03:04.420> because<00:03:04.569> you<00:03:04.750> can<00:03:04.870> get<00:03:04.959> a<00:03:04.989> roof<00:03:05.230> for<00:03:05.410> this

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
lid because you can get a roof for this

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.250 
lid because you can get a roof for this
case<00:03:05.830> so<00:03:06.040> if<00:03:06.100> you<00:03:06.190> have<00:03:06.310> cats<00:03:06.549> or<00:03:06.910> dogs<00:03:07.260> that

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 
case so if you have cats or dogs that

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.770 
case so if you have cats or dogs that
would<00:03:08.350> jump<00:03:08.470> into<00:03:08.680> your<00:03:08.769> cage<00:03:08.980> then<00:03:09.760> and<00:03:10.239> there

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:10.780 
would jump into your cage then and there

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:12.300 
would jump into your cage then and there
is<00:03:10.870> a<00:03:10.900> roof<00:03:11.170> so<00:03:11.440> obviously<00:03:11.860> you<00:03:11.980> should<00:03:12.130> use

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
is a roof so obviously you should use

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:14.520 
is a roof so obviously you should use
that<00:03:12.459> outside<00:03:12.940> as<00:03:13.180> an<00:03:13.299> outdoor<00:03:13.569> pen<00:03:14.170> how

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
that outside as an outdoor pen how

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:17.039 
that outside as an outdoor pen how
clever<00:03:14.890> so<00:03:15.670> if<00:03:16.030> you<00:03:16.239> were<00:03:16.450> thinking<00:03:16.510> of<00:03:16.900> just

00:03:17.039 --> 00:03:17.049 
clever so if you were thinking of just

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:18.440 
clever so if you were thinking of just
getting<00:03:17.200> this<00:03:17.319> for<00:03:17.470> two<00:03:17.620> guinea<00:03:17.829> pigs<00:03:18.130> and<00:03:18.370> you

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
getting this for two guinea pigs and you

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:21.210 
getting this for two guinea pigs and you
don't<00:03:19.450> have<00:03:19.630> kin<00:03:20.320> of<00:03:20.410> the<00:03:20.500> space<00:03:20.739> to<00:03:20.890> be<00:03:20.920> stored

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:21.220 
don't have kin of the space to be stored

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:22.979 
don't have kin of the space to be stored
in<00:03:21.310> a<00:03:21.430> lot<00:03:21.579> of<00:03:21.609> things<00:03:21.850> this<00:03:22.359> case<00:03:22.660> would<00:03:22.870> be

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:22.989 
in a lot of things this case would be

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:24.060 
in a lot of things this case would be
really<00:03:23.230> good<00:03:23.350> because<00:03:23.440> you<00:03:23.620> could<00:03:23.680> use<00:03:23.859> it<00:03:23.980> as

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:24.070 
really good because you could use it as

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:28.400 
really good because you could use it as
a<00:03:24.100> cage<00:03:24.430> and<00:03:24.700> an<00:03:24.880> outdoor<00:03:25.000> pen<00:03:25.450> or<00:03:25.630> a<00:03:25.660> play<00:03:25.900> pen

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:31.920 

so<00:03:29.410> here<00:03:29.590> it<00:03:29.709> is<00:03:29.890> all<00:03:30.220> sort<00:03:30.609> of<00:03:30.730> set<00:03:31.390> up<00:03:31.600> it's

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:31.930 
so here it is all sort of set up it's

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:33.780 
so here it is all sort of set up it's
really<00:03:32.350> it<00:03:32.500> was<00:03:32.709> perfect<00:03:33.160> for<00:03:33.310> what<00:03:33.700> I'm

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:33.790 
really it was perfect for what I'm

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:34.440 
really it was perfect for what I'm
looking<00:03:33.820> for

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:34.450 
looking for

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:35.970 
looking for
it<00:03:34.780> looks<00:03:34.959> a<00:03:35.049> bit<00:03:35.079> squiffy<00:03:35.440> at<00:03:35.650> the<00:03:35.709> moment

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:35.980 
it looks a bit squiffy at the moment

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:37.050 
it looks a bit squiffy at the moment
because<00:03:36.070> I'm<00:03:36.220> not<00:03:36.340> going<00:03:36.459> to<00:03:36.549> finish<00:03:36.700> putting

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.060 
because I'm not going to finish putting

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:38.310 
because I'm not going to finish putting
it<00:03:37.150> together<00:03:37.269> say<00:03:37.660> I'm<00:03:37.780> just<00:03:37.989> going<00:03:38.079> to<00:03:38.230> be

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:38.320 
it together say I'm just going to be

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:39.599 
it together say I'm just going to be
putting<00:03:38.500> it<00:03:38.620> back<00:03:38.739> in<00:03:38.920> the<00:03:38.950> box<00:03:39.220> ready<00:03:39.370> for

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:39.609 
putting it back in the box ready for

00:03:39.609 --> 00:03:42.330 
putting it back in the box ready for
traveling<00:03:40.030> and<00:03:40.209> I<00:03:41.140> will<00:03:41.380> most<00:03:41.530> definitely<00:03:41.859> be

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.340 
traveling and I will most definitely be

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:44.370 
traveling and I will most definitely be
getting<00:03:42.489> another<00:03:43.090> one<00:03:43.390> to<00:03:43.900> do<00:03:44.019> an<00:03:44.079> expansion

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:44.380 
getting another one to do an expansion

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:47.190 
getting another one to do an expansion
so<00:03:45.010> that<00:03:45.040> the<00:03:45.250> girls<00:03:45.519> will<00:03:45.910> have<00:03:45.940> a<00:03:46.359> lot<00:03:47.170> more

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:47.200 
so that the girls will have a lot more

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.500 
so that the girls will have a lot more
space<00:03:47.650> and<00:03:47.799> it<00:03:47.890> won't<00:03:48.070> be<00:03:48.220> misma<00:03:48.579> mish-mashed

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:49.510 
space and it won't be misma mish-mashed

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:52.319 
space and it won't be misma mish-mashed
with<00:03:49.780> my<00:03:49.900> grids<00:03:50.200> the<00:03:51.040> bottom<00:03:51.519> the<00:03:51.850> base<00:03:52.060> is

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:52.329 
with my grids the bottom the base is

00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:53.490 
with my grids the bottom the base is
sort<00:03:52.480> of<00:03:52.540> canvas<00:03:52.750> on<00:03:53.019> the<00:03:53.109> outside<00:03:53.380> and

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:53.500 
sort of canvas on the outside and

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.140 
sort of canvas on the outside and
waterproof<00:03:53.950> on<00:03:54.100> the<00:03:54.190> inside<00:03:54.519> and<00:03:54.730> it<00:03:54.910> seems

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:55.150 
waterproof on the inside and it seems

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:57.059 
waterproof on the inside and it seems
really<00:03:55.269> thick<00:03:55.720> and<00:03:55.870> durable<00:03:56.079> so<00:03:56.890> that's

00:03:57.059 --> 00:03:57.069 
really thick and durable so that's

00:03:57.069 --> 00:03:58.920 
really thick and durable so that's
really<00:03:57.310> great<00:03:57.519> and<00:03:57.790> it's<00:03:58.329> also<00:03:58.600> on<00:03:58.900> the

00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:58.930 
really great and it's also on the

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:01.380 
really great and it's also on the
outside<00:03:59.500> of<00:03:59.650> the<00:03:59.739> cage<00:03:59.950> so<00:04:00.670> the<00:04:01.000> guinea<00:04:01.150> pigs

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:01.390 
outside of the cage so the guinea pigs

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:02.670 
outside of the cage so the guinea pigs
aren't<00:04:01.690> gonna<00:04:01.780> be<00:04:01.930> able<00:04:01.989> to<00:04:02.109> chew<00:04:02.319> it<00:04:02.410> which<00:04:02.530> is

really<00:04:03.010> good<00:04:03.310> and<00:04:03.840> because<00:04:04.840> the<00:04:04.989> base<00:04:05.170> is

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:05.410 
really good and because the base is

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:08.849 
really good and because the base is

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:00.360 
really suitable I mean the grids aren't

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:02.400 
really suitable I mean the grids aren't
amazing<00:05:01.360> but<00:05:01.600> you<00:05:01.720> can<00:05:01.870> actually<00:05:02.020> buy<00:05:02.350> these

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:02.410 
amazing but you can actually buy these

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:05.190 
amazing but you can actually buy these
bases<00:05:03.220> and<00:05:03.600> just<00:05:04.600> on<00:05:04.720> their<00:05:04.840> own<00:05:04.900> just<00:05:05.140> a

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:05.200 
bases and just on their own just a

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:06.690 
bases and just on their own just a
replacement<00:05:05.680> base<00:05:05.800> I<00:05:05.950> think<00:05:06.130> for<00:05:06.220> about<00:05:06.370> 15

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:06.700 
replacement base I think for about 15

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:08.670 
replacement base I think for about 15
pound<00:05:06.970> so<00:05:07.570> it<00:05:07.690> might<00:05:07.870> actually<00:05:08.050> be<00:05:08.440> worth

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:08.680 
pound so it might actually be worth

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:10.770 
pound so it might actually be worth
buying<00:05:08.980> one<00:05:09.400> of<00:05:09.430> these<00:05:09.640> bases<00:05:10.120> to<00:05:10.300> use<00:05:10.450> even

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:10.780 
buying one of these bases to use even

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:12.480 
buying one of these bases to use even
just<00:05:10.960> with<00:05:11.080> seeing<00:05:11.350> secrets<00:05:11.740> you<00:05:12.220> wouldn't

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:12.490 
just with seeing secrets you wouldn't

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:13.890 
just with seeing secrets you wouldn't
have<00:05:12.640> to<00:05:12.820> use<00:05:12.940> this<00:05:13.090> grid<00:05:13.360> you<00:05:13.480> could<00:05:13.630> put<00:05:13.780> your

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:13.900 
have to use this grid you could put your

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:15.810 
have to use this grid you could put your
own<00:05:14.020> in<00:05:14.050> I<00:05:14.410> think<00:05:14.950> this<00:05:15.100> is<00:05:15.220> the<00:05:15.370> equivalent<00:05:15.760> of

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:15.820 
own in I think this is the equivalent of

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:20.280 
own in I think this is the equivalent of
a<00:05:15.910> 2x4<00:05:16.890> so<00:05:17.890> it<00:05:18.340> would<00:05:18.790> be<00:05:18.940> a<00:05:19.120> really<00:05:19.750> good<00:05:19.990> cage

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:20.290 
a 2x4 so it would be a really good cage

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:23.310 
a 2x4 so it would be a really good cage
for<00:05:20.770> two<00:05:21.280> to<00:05:21.430> three<00:05:21.580> guinea<00:05:21.790> pigs<00:05:22.030> so<00:05:22.270> so<00:05:23.110> far

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:23.320 
for two to three guinea pigs so so far

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:27.570 
for two to three guinea pigs so so far
I'm<00:05:23.470> really<00:05:23.500> impressed<00:05:23.770> with<00:05:24.370> the<00:05:24.610> EM<00:05:26.580> Midwest

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:27.580 
I'm really impressed with the EM Midwest

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:30.450 
I'm really impressed with the EM Midwest
guinea<00:05:28.150> pig<00:05:28.330> guinea<00:05:28.990> pig<00:05:29.290> habitat<00:05:29.740> honestly<00:05:30.430> I

I'm going to need to have the door open
and<00:05:43.710> sort<00:05:44.710> of<00:05:44.740> give<00:05:44.920> them<00:05:45.040> extra<00:05:45.310> space<00:05:45.580> when<00:05:45.730> I

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:45.850 
and sort of give them extra space when I

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:47.760 
and sort of give them extra space when I
set<00:05:46.030> up<00:05:46.060> my<00:05:46.210> own<00:05:46.300> grids<00:05:46.750> which<00:05:46.960> is<00:05:47.080> great<00:05:47.290> but

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:47.770 
set up my own grids which is great but

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:49.980 
set up my own grids which is great but
if<00:05:47.920> you<00:05:48.010> buy<00:05:48.220> another<00:05:48.670> guinea<00:05:49.330> pig<00:05:49.510> habitat

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:49.990 
if you buy another guinea pig habitat

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:52.230 
if you buy another guinea pig habitat
you<00:05:50.170> can<00:05:50.350> and<00:05:50.650> buy<00:05:51.040> these<00:05:51.100> ramps<00:05:51.670> to<00:05:51.850> put<00:05:52.060> over

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:52.240 
you can and buy these ramps to put over

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:54.140 
you can and buy these ramps to put over
that<00:05:52.270> but<00:05:52.570> I<00:05:52.600> just<00:05:52.960> be<00:05:53.050> tempted<00:05:53.380> to<00:05:53.500> put<00:05:53.620> em

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:54.150 
that but I just be tempted to put em

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:56.340 
that but I just be tempted to put em
some<00:05:55.150> kind<00:05:55.300> of<00:05:55.330> fleece<00:05:55.600> or<00:05:55.750> towel<00:05:56.050> in<00:05:56.140> on<00:05:56.230> the

00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:56.350 
some kind of fleece or towel in on the

00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:58.110 
some kind of fleece or towel in on the
vamp<00:05:56.530> just<00:05:56.800> to<00:05:57.040> stop<00:05:57.610> them<00:05:57.760> hurting<00:05:58.000> the

00:05:58.110 --> 00:05:58.120 
vamp just to stop them hurting the

00:05:58.120 --> 00:05:59.970 
vamp just to stop them hurting the
little<00:05:58.330> feet<00:05:58.510> but<00:05:59.320> I<00:05:59.350> think<00:05:59.530> the<00:05:59.590> guinea<00:05:59.740> pigs

00:05:59.970 --> 00:05:59.980 
little feet but I think the guinea pigs

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:01.650 
little feet but I think the guinea pigs
will<00:06:00.070> be<00:06:00.160> able<00:06:00.280> to<00:06:00.370> jump<00:06:00.520> out<00:06:00.700> there<00:06:00.880> no

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:01.660 
will be able to jump out there no

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:04.680 
will be able to jump out there no
problem<00:06:02.170> or<00:06:03.120> alternatively<00:06:04.120> you<00:06:04.300> could<00:06:04.450> just

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:04.690 
problem or alternatively you could just

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:07.050 
problem or alternatively you could just
take<00:06:05.320> this<00:06:05.530> bit<00:06:05.920> apart<00:06:06.190> and<00:06:06.520> they<00:06:06.730> would<00:06:06.910> just

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:07.060 
take this bit apart and they would just

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:10.230 
take this bit apart and they would just
be<00:06:07.180> able<00:06:07.240> to<00:06:07.390> jump<00:06:07.570> over<00:06:07.720> the<00:06:07.930> side<00:06:08.110> so<00:06:08.440> I<00:06:09.240> think

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:10.240 
be able to jump over the side so I think

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:12.420 
be able to jump over the side so I think
you<00:06:10.480> can<00:06:10.660> get<00:06:11.380> oh<00:06:11.410> that<00:06:11.650> I'm<00:06:11.770> quite<00:06:12.010> happy<00:06:12.160> with

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:12.430 
you can get oh that I'm quite happy with

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:13.830 
you can get oh that I'm quite happy with
this<00:06:12.550> cage<00:06:12.850> and<00:06:13.060> I<00:06:13.210> will<00:06:13.360> definitely<00:06:13.750> be

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:13.840 
this cage and I will definitely be

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:16.140 
this cage and I will definitely be
buying<00:06:13.990> another<00:06:14.440> section<00:06:14.920> when<00:06:15.580> I<00:06:15.610> move<00:06:15.940> to<00:06:16.090> my

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:16.150 
buying another section when I move to my

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:18.570 
buying another section when I move to my
new<00:06:16.360> home<00:06:16.570> so<00:06:17.140> um<00:06:17.530> there<00:06:18.160> aren't<00:06:18.370> going<00:06:18.460> to<00:06:18.520> be

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:18.580 
new home so um there aren't going to be

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:21.450 
new home so um there aren't going to be
any<00:06:18.790> more<00:06:19.030> videos<00:06:19.420> until<00:06:19.990> I<00:06:20.320> have<00:06:20.680> moved<00:06:21.010> and

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:21.460 
any more videos until I have moved and

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:24.510 
any more videos until I have moved and
obviously<00:06:22.120> got<00:06:22.600> internet<00:06:23.050> setup<00:06:23.410> and<00:06:23.680> this

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:24.520 
obviously got internet setup and this

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:26.850 
obviously got internet setup and this
kind<00:06:24.820> of<00:06:24.910> thing<00:06:25.150> so<00:06:25.450> this<00:06:26.320> could<00:06:26.560> be<00:06:26.590> the<00:06:26.740> last

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:26.860
