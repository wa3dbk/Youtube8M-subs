00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:10.230
 new build craft update yes yes yes 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:12.710
 it came out update 341 and in it 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:17.070
 there was such a very cool thing like 

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:21.000
 pipes from amerlin yes it is very steep 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:24.029
 other account they work just like 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.699
 wooden wooden you remind not 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:29.730
 pull out 

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:32.910
 Generally box some things but now it 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.950
 not just wooden pipes it can to 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.340
 such improved or wooden other so 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.399
 how not 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.530
 In short, but I am merlin and the sea club 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.960
 we get such pipes 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:49.739
 You can also make a waterproof project 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:54.030
 there is waterproof here as well so than 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.600
 all the same joke here intern the whole count 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:01:00.739
 will show 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:05.159
 I'll put a half and an example of a glass box 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:07.369
 but if agitators are now on this pipe 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:12.240
 the prophet to the mouse will open us inventory 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:14.250
 filter it will put coal and then it will 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.430
 pull only the coal that is there 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:20.750
 there is a video here he does not touch the glass 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:24.090
 and prey dilinde fish for a long time to come 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:26.990
 if you put the glass filter then he 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.990
 sing the glass 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:32.380
 but where 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:43.190
 everyone can see us the more glass 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:02:00.900
 the strangeness of time wounds here in this here 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:02:00.900
 glass that often come on 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:12.880
 strange kei suppose just glass 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:22.640
 let us put coal and coal here that is 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:25.850
 The clown took away from the release, but the angles went 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:27.740
 this is some kind of bug was generally well here 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:30.710
 such cool pipes 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:33.020
 then again I repeat from the pipe 

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:35.150
 same there is waterproof and they 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:38.540
 serve as such for motion sickness 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:42.050
 liquids and beyond tanks further 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:45.470
 wooden but there is no filter in them just 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:48.320
 but it looks beautiful that is they 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:50.570
 just about impenetrable this usually bills 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:57.160
 no different 

00:02:50.570 --> 00:03:00.590
 These are the ones with filter for 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:03.560
 to transport ordinary things and so 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:06.800
