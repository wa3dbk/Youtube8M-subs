00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.370
 there are those who thank you very well for this yet another 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:08.460
 will be mine that we are here today 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:10.440
 this new episode of the series but the 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.139
 always roped in the last episode 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.839
 the episode written in the title type il 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:18.539
 world bug ater like that I came out 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:20.789
 however to save the world thanks to you and 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.789
 let it have your comments 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:26.039
 forgotten here a species here 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.830
 of button that concerned to the 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.689
 redzone mode was able to exit the note 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.960
 if I went with vanilla or with 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:36.570
 microsoft normal without block launcher 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:38.520
 it made the whole world collapse then 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.620
 there was also a lever some partner not 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.230
 I remember well thanks to you I am 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.719
 managed to take it off I took it off a 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.940
 moment I put the razon mode and I have it 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:50.820
 easily removed where it undermined 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:53.399
 block and we succeeded anyway in 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.930
 recover the world thanks to you then 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.760
 Raimondo landfill should no longer 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.340
 trace even now with networks 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.800
 it doesn't grow anymore the world is saved 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.780
 finally then anyway today I think 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.909
 that we can make chairs a 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.220
 sun as he has promised you obviously 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.140
 here I had to risk again from scratch 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.610
 because works of the world in the last do 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.590
 released logic 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.200
 so for him to save him because why 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.970
 last world was really given its own 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:20.640
 mandate and therefore I have not succeeded in 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.830
 save it squad that i released and i have to 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.330
 to make a deckchair pleasure here and 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.340
 I had to re-work everything again 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.650
 this but nothing you need here is there 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.479
 still the sand on the ground so nothing 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.759
 what we managed to recover and 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.229
 that is the important thing then today then 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.840
 we will win to make some rai rhinestones ho 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:39.180
 here in front of me I have enough comments 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.220
 yours where michele telari attracts 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:44.310
 precisely it states that in any case it does not 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:47.040
 I will make all 150 of you 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.479
 sent but I will do it for fifty 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.250
 here half if there will be 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.960
 bad that it goes then I also expand it 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.299
 supreme and the mountain then we will see 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.939
 however how to do from them together how 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:02:00.060
 the field rajo of francesco fontana which 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:02.369
 the wood with us asks us for a florist 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.750
 written precisely francesco fontana then 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.200
 the soul take our wood 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.960
 to take 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.469
 on the po here full food with give 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.110
 something 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:12.450
 ok laid a little sand I had 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.730
 taken here I also take a lot of 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:17.099
 walnut wood a sheep we will leave it in 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.599
 sight and then here liri to start 

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:20.760
 this one who said he wants it 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:23.760
 all the wood I did not specify how 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:26.730
 he wants it so I'll do it a little by way of 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.590
 my ways then ray kroc this here 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.269
 bahbout true need forgotten 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.580
 brothers are also forgotten 

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:34.500
 fundamental or the cartels then 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:36.930
 we will go cross or a little if we have 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:40.140
 wood obviously the lies two ready 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:42.299
 to all the wood we had yesterday 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:44.489
 I would say that we are not too well placed 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:47.640
 with wood he thinks I will have to do it anyway 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:49.739
 go and collect some trees of 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.700
 room maybe at least not for us is 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:53.220
 too much 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:55.709
 I have 8 signs I think they will be enough for 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:57.030
 I really think so then one does 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:59.190
 called rai did then we will put 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:01.849
 immediately his name or francesco 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:05.040
 we will put it exactly here 

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:08.190
 so a series of slides is made hopefully 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:10.170
 that you like and sly was placed for you 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:13.620
 so let's do the next if the deckchair 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:16.139
 believe me famer then did not specify 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:19.139
 like so I always want 

00:03:16.139 --> 00:03:22.430
 as I tell him like a stuff of the 

00:03:19.139 --> 00:03:26.459
 generally the contrast too apt 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:29.519
 obviously we record mikus things here 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:32.579
 part with the z because cazzola a way 

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:33.900
 month sign from ok so it's a fact 

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:35.280
 we must also go to sleep because 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:37.350
 has made night so we go to sleep 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.840
 see you later with the next six a 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:42.319
 deckchair ok we are also ready for the 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:46.650
 next deck chair that asks 

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:49.799
 gabriele quinti 0 I suppose who is here is 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:52.139
 however then the current in stone bric 

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:54.060
 let's do a little so obviously here 

00:03:52.139 --> 00:03:56.780
 while I will put her as we are 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:59.780
 some umbrellas to take off a little less 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:59.780
 write 

00:04:03.189 --> 00:04:09.200
 I'm sorry but I know not all of you name 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:11.689
 it will only be gabriele fifth to such an end 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:14.599
 ok theme of the sign elsewhere 

00:04:11.689 --> 00:04:18.320
 yo and this evening was made or 

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:21.650
 we 'll do another one again I think notes on 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:24.620
 epic drive hano yes in my opinion 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:27.979
 however then the avola wants wood 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:30.320
 red which unfortunately I do not have it 

00:04:27.979 --> 00:04:32.300
 I'll do as I do 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:35.000
 I was of the mind but are not 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:36.949
 still went to the savannah so I did n't 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.860
 what materials you believe me then 

00:04:36.949 --> 00:04:41.419
 sorry i will do it this way the name 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:43.850
 it's spicy so we put it on 

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:46.280
 this part also from this other is 

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:48.410
 best done 4 out of 6 and deckchairs 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:51.880
 so many we do the next evening 

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:54.470
 9 beautiful skizzo deckchair really 

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:56.060
 who also works all the wood 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:57.760
 you really have a lot of kids all 

00:04:56.060 --> 00:05:01.250
 you want the woods 

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:05.060
 since I have no wood canvas I do in 

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:07.570
 this way there is that design that you 

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:09.770
 style anyway and always wood from 

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:11.960
 mat and stand up I 'm a little short 

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:14.389
 of minerals I don't know why but 

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:16.190
 I'm wary of everything else 

00:05:14.389 --> 00:05:19.310
 anyway while i welcome sun nothing or 

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:22.460
 tell you that the headquarters of the rai is going 

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:24.169
 very very well from what I'm seeing e 

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:26.090
 so I'm very happy there too 

00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:28.820
 they sell a lot like it in that one 

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:30.500
 very many face cervini series this 

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:32.389
 it means that that series b likes 

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:34.970
 really a lot and I 'm really 

00:05:32.389 --> 00:05:36.889
 very very happy and people anyway 

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:40.220
 to do even much longer episodes 

00:05:36.889 --> 00:05:42.470
 like not just five minutes but anyway 

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:44.960
 that series ii in the rush will do episodes 

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:46.849
 pretty curtains because it's one 

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:48.349
 miniseries so I think I'll do it all again 

00:05:46.849 --> 00:05:50.270
 however that evening is wrapping 

00:05:48.349 --> 00:05:50.840
 almost at the end so there is no 

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:52.849
 worry 

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:54.830
 maybe another one will start anyway 

00:05:52.849 --> 00:05:56.479
 consisting of here you will find we are also 

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:58.789
 exceeding 10 minutes maybe we have 

00:05:56.479 --> 00:06:00.650
 also already exceeded and we are already beyond 

00:05:58.789 --> 00:06:02.419
 12 minutes come a very long time 

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:03.620
 we hoped 

00:06:02.419 --> 00:06:05.360
 many of you have requested me that 

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:06.860
 they just wanted longer episodes 

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:09.620
 so and how to satisfy even for 

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:12.409
 this always let me like it under the 

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:14.300
 top a thing we serve at over 100 mi 

00:06:12.409 --> 00:06:15.650
 like in this TV series we come 

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:19.070
 even at 200 times 

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:22.699
 we serve at 120 more or less as you like 

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:25.449
 tonight at 21 on the channel will be released a 

00:06:22.699 --> 00:06:28.250
 new and more than the rush towards the mater bi 

00:06:25.449 --> 00:06:29.690
 check it out a lot below if you want 

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:31.669
 precisely this was another episode 

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:33.410
 of the rush and now we're going to do 

00:06:31.669 --> 00:06:34.910
 a last challenge so sdrive at least the 

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:37.250
 we end up with these episodes anyway 

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:39.620
 great we have all the lake afford 

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:42.500
 only you will make yo it would be a little one 

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:44.930
 madness but we would be ok here let's go to 

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:48.020
 conclude this deckchair then 

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:50.139
 sketch so he forgot 

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:52.669
 so tm is much more gamekeepers 

00:06:50.139 --> 00:06:55.340
 but also the cartel from other parts 

00:06:52.669 --> 00:06:58.400
 so for this episode I think that 

00:06:55.340 --> 00:07:00.590
 we have finished the signature yo maybe 

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:04.010
 later we will make others of course there 

00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:05.990
 they will still be willing so if they are 

00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:08.539
 we would do so many others here I think 

00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:09.590
 I will close the lake that is not too much 

00:07:08.539 --> 00:07:13.039
 I will close maybe in this initial part 

00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:14.960
 so to make them stay longer there I hope that 

00:07:13.039 --> 00:07:16.190
 these episodes you enjoyed me 

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:18.860
 I therefore remember to leave one and myself 

00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:21.680
 like if you want the tonight at 9pm 

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:25.240
 next episode of the rush on the network 

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:25.240
 no cvm next video
