00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.250
 very good lethal how are you and the fucking 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.070
 chicken thigh of lethal brother if I'm 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.960
 in a black ops 1 with caspar in for 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.700
 show you how astronaut worth bitching 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.770
 Here you are seeing is Gasparín 

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:21.330
 pounces on but do not know if 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.460
 that I had the wrong pointer on the 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.649
 pipe or was the badly situated or was 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.570
 pounced before or after against the 

00:00:25.649 --> 00:00:29.489
 astronaut but come on did not come out here 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.110
 is here I will show you how 

00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:32.759
 chances of it coming out of like 

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:34.170
 it comes to me like it does not come to me like 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.280
 gasparini comes out as he does not find them 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.530
 gasparin so I hope that what 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.969
 you learn well and nothing all this serves 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.310
 for you to make a piece of record 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:44.700
 both solo and cooperative in 

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:46.829
 moon, you know, the astronaut will 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.660
 take a drink so try 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.760
 do it in round two or three as much 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.500
 so that we can remove the drink and so 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.720
 I do not spend money because you know 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.790
 that one has to do enough pastita 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:58.470
 well now you're going to see how 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:00.329
 I get it, you have to see 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:02.160
 exactly where I place myself as he placed 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.920
 the pointer of the pipe exactly above 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.659
 of the second pyramid on the left 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.890
 ok if you have any questions 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.509
 ask that the only thing you have to 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.759
 to do is to look at the video well 

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:13.770
 exactly where I stand and how do I put 

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:17.189
 the pointers are worth over the pyramid 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:19.619
 you have seen exactly how the 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:21.539
 'brick' Sep 16th is this one no longer us 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.250
 will bother you more in the whole game is worth 

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:25.049
 not being shot we're worth having very 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.880
 note that you can not shoot him 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:29.609
 You can let them illuminated 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.469
 lebu what if you ask for from the area 

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:32.880
 a vale and never again you come again 

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:35.700
 here and you put in first room 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.709
 Dodge them without astronaut you'll see what 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.119
 handsome is lethal now you are going to see a 

00:01:37.709 --> 00:01:42.869
 failure this is a placement fault 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:45.030
 ok you do not see the astronaut because I 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.409
 wrongly placed exactly I think that I 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.569
 He should have placed a little 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.640
 more to the left and lethal let's it 

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:52.369
 The only thing you have to do is advance 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.020
 with the star not towards the astronaut 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:57.149
 when the first leg is passing 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.590
 passat the first leg through the fence and 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:01.049
 before he leans on the ground he 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.700
 jce jup is worth before he supports 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:04.530
 remember then you are balances and 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.569
 supposedly if it has gone well if you 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.910
 you have placed well and you have put the 

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:11.310
 pointers above the pyramid because it 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.780
 I would have to look for a voucher and I would have 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:16.260
 stop them from bothering forever the 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.970
 Astronaut fucking if you ship to not 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.250
 do not go because you can go back to 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:22.709
 look for it later in round 60 in round 70 and 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:25.200
 it is already valid if I know cases that have 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:26.879
 unveiled but very few so nothing 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.069
 nothing happens, you look for it again and 

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:31.640
 I am going to say that this is not 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:34.079
 consider traps or hack or cliches a 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:38.670
 failure of the game that we take advantage of 

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:41.909
 to be able to make high rounds without having 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:43.290
 have to have the fucking astronaut bothering 

00:02:41.909 --> 00:02:45.989
 it is worth to us now you have seen the camera of 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:48.090
 gasparín like it does not obtain it is worth as 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:50.040
 fails as you do not see the fucking astronaut 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:52.349
 as we fuck like we're going to fuck the 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.109
 rest of the bitch split and good now 

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:57.269
 you are going to see the last clip in which 

00:02:54.109 --> 00:03:00.510
 looking at me to gasp and we see as how 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:02.129
 get it ok it 's very easy if you have 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:04.049
 some doubt the only thing that you have to 

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:06.840
 do is ask me and you know that you 

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:09.840
 can go as much as the first 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:11.819
 the second as the 20 is worth or even the 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.920
 30 if you scratch a lot you take 30 tries 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:15.720
 it will be because you are not well placed or 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:17.879
 because the pointer you have not put it 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.170
 well or because you have not advanced in 

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:20.760
 the right moment is worth the 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:21.550
 astronaut look like gasparin it 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.740
 pouncing 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:25.630
 and it works perfectly, I've already 

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:27.940
 shown as I fail as I do 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:30.370
 I get like gaspar fails and like gaspar 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:31.450
 get it good lethal if you have 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:33.100
 some doubt the only thing you have to 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:34.930
 do is ask me the and look 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:39.540
 in the video leaving chicken in the air 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:39.540
 greetings to all until the next
