00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.030 
select them again and we're going to go
ahead<00:01:59.460> into<00:01:59.670> our<00:01:59.939> warp<00:02:00.299> tool<00:02:00.630> so<00:02:01.439> select<00:02:01.890> this

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
ahead into our warp tool so select this

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.069 
ahead into our warp tool so select this
make<00:02:02.549> sure<00:02:02.579> you<00:02:02.729> choose<00:02:02.939> warp<00:02:03.210> and<00:02:03.450> then

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
make sure you choose warp and then

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:07.190 
make sure you choose warp and then
double<00:02:04.530> click<00:02:04.680> it<00:02:05.630> you<00:02:06.630> may<00:02:06.780> want<00:02:06.960> to<00:02:06.990> try

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
double click it you may want to try

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.750 
double click it you may want to try
these<00:02:07.439> settings<00:02:07.890> 150<00:02:08.580> 150<00:02:09.270> 0<00:02:09.300> 10<00:02:10.200> percent<00:02:10.760> 250

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
these settings 150 150 0 10 percent 250

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.320 
these settings 150 150 0 10 percent 250
and<00:02:11.970> hit<00:02:12.690> OK

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
and hit OK

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.320 
and hit OK
and<00:02:15.330> now<00:02:15.780> simply<00:02:16.110> just<00:02:16.560> take<00:02:16.800> it<00:02:16.980> and<00:02:17.330> move

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
and now simply just take it and move

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.830 
and now simply just take it and move
your<00:02:18.690> mouse<00:02:19.230> around<00:02:19.440> and<00:02:20.010> warp<00:02:20.970> these<00:02:21.269> lines<00:02:21.599> a

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
your mouse around and warp these lines a

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:27.979 
your mouse around and warp these lines a
bit<00:02:23.599> you<00:02:24.599> wanted<00:02:24.840> to<00:02:24.959> look<00:02:25.760> random<00:02:26.840> cuz<00:02:27.840> it's

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:27.989 
bit you wanted to look random cuz it's

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:43.300 
bit you wanted to look random cuz it's
wood<00:02:28.230> it's<00:02:28.500> not<00:02:28.709> perfect

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:45.880 

once<00:02:44.180> you're<00:02:44.330> happy<00:02:44.480> with<00:02:44.780> that<00:02:44.840> I'm<00:02:45.740> gonna

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890 
once you're happy with that I'm gonna

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:47.350 
once you're happy with that I'm gonna
deselect<00:02:46.100> so<00:02:46.700> you<00:02:46.790> can<00:02:46.910> see<00:02:47.090> what<00:02:47.180> it<00:02:47.240> looks

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 
deselect so you can see what it looks

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.050 
deselect so you can see what it looks
like<00:02:47.860> so<00:02:48.860> so<00:02:49.160> far<00:02:49.400> so<00:02:49.640> good

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.060 
like so so far so good

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:52.750 
like so so far so good
and<00:02:50.450> now<00:02:51.140> we<00:02:51.200> want<00:02:51.470> to<00:02:51.560> make<00:02:51.680> some<00:02:52.010> of<00:02:52.430> these

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
and now we want to make some of these

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.910 
and now we want to make some of these
kind<00:02:53.090> of<00:02:53.150> things<00:02:53.240> here<00:02:53.690> these<00:02:53.930> dimples<00:02:54.530> and

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920 
kind of things here these dimples and

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:55.720 
kind of things here these dimples and
stuff<00:02:55.130> like<00:02:55.280> that

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
stuff like that

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:58.480 
stuff like that
so<00:02:56.230> where<00:02:57.230> your<00:02:57.380> warp<00:02:57.680> tool<00:02:57.920> is<00:02:58.130> we're<00:02:58.400> gonna

00:02:58.480 --> 00:02:58.490 
so where your warp tool is we're gonna

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:01.780 
so where your warp tool is we're gonna
go<00:02:58.730> with<00:02:58.910> the<00:02:59.860> let's<00:03:00.860> start<00:03:01.070> with<00:03:01.190> the<00:03:01.400> twirl

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790 
go with the let's start with the twirl

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:05.710 
go with the let's start with the twirl
tool<00:03:02.150> and<00:03:02.480> I'm<00:03:03.200> gonna<00:03:03.320> double<00:03:03.680> click<00:03:03.800> it<00:03:04.070> and<00:03:04.720> I

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:05.720 
tool and I'm gonna double click it and I

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:07.720 
tool and I'm gonna double click it and I
have<00:03:05.810> intensity<00:03:06.290> 10%<00:03:07.160> I<00:03:07.310> think<00:03:07.490> when<00:03:07.580> we<00:03:07.640> go

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
have intensity 10% I think when we go

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:11.800 
have intensity 10% I think when we go
down<00:03:07.880> to<00:03:08.030> 5%<00:03:09.970> so<00:03:10.970> you<00:03:11.060> can<00:03:11.180> use<00:03:11.300> these<00:03:11.450> settings

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.810 
down to 5% so you can use these settings

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:21.190 
down to 5% so you can use these settings
here<00:03:13.000> let's<00:03:14.000> see<00:03:14.270> here<00:03:14.570> there<00:03:15.320> you<00:03:15.440> go<00:03:20.200> you

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 
here let's see here there you go you

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:26.560 
here let's see here there you go you
just<00:03:21.590> do<00:03:21.770> some<00:03:21.980> of<00:03:22.070> these<00:03:25.120> the<00:03:26.120> longer<00:03:26.450> you

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:26.570 
just do some of these the longer you

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:28.120 
just do some of these the longer you
hold<00:03:26.720> it<00:03:26.900> the<00:03:26.959> more<00:03:27.110> it<00:03:27.320> does<00:03:27.500> so<00:03:27.770> maybe<00:03:27.950> some

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:28.130 
hold it the more it does so maybe some

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:31.630 
hold it the more it does so maybe some
quit<00:03:28.459> some<00:03:28.640> quick<00:03:28.910> taps<00:03:29.209> just<00:03:30.080> a<00:03:30.400> some<00:03:31.400> quick

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:31.640 
quit some quick taps just a some quick

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:34.330 
quit some quick taps just a some quick
quick<00:03:31.970> taps<00:03:32.360> there<00:03:32.860> and<00:03:33.860> then<00:03:34.040> I'm<00:03:34.100> gonna<00:03:34.250> go

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:34.340 
quick taps there and then I'm gonna go

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:36.699 
quick taps there and then I'm gonna go
ahead<00:03:34.459> and<00:03:34.910> I'm<00:03:35.270> gonna<00:03:35.390> choose<00:03:35.840> the<00:03:36.260> pucker

00:03:36.699 --> 00:03:36.709 
ahead and I'm gonna choose the pucker

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:40.750 
ahead and I'm gonna choose the pucker
tool<00:03:37.150> double<00:03:38.150> click<00:03:38.300> it<00:03:39.160> so<00:03:40.160> you<00:03:40.220> can<00:03:40.340> see<00:03:40.550> what

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760 
tool double click it so you can see what

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:43.780 
tool double click it so you can see what
I<00:03:40.790> have<00:03:41.030> here<00:03:42.250> click<00:03:43.250> OK

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:43.790 
I have here click OK

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:47.320 
I have here click OK
and<00:03:44.270> then<00:03:45.080> I'm<00:03:45.410> gonna<00:03:45.590> do<00:03:45.830> some<00:03:45.860> of<00:03:46.130> that<00:03:46.330> and

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:47.330 
and then I'm gonna do some of that and

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:48.580 
and then I'm gonna do some of that and
what<00:03:47.450> that<00:03:47.480> does<00:03:47.720> is<00:03:47.870> it<00:03:48.019> brings<00:03:48.170> some<00:03:48.440> of<00:03:48.470> the

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:48.590 
what that does is it brings some of the

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:54.699 
what that does is it brings some of the
lines<00:03:48.739> in<00:03:49.070> together

00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:54.709 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:57.399 

and<00:03:55.340> there<00:03:55.459> you<00:03:55.609> go<00:03:55.840> that's<00:03:56.840> all<00:03:56.989> you<00:03:57.140> need<00:03:57.290> to
