okay<00:00:00.480> we're<00:00:00.599> going<00:00:00.690> to<00:00:00.750> attach<00:00:01.079> braided<00:00:01.920> line

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:02.070 
okay we're going to attach braided line

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.530 
okay we're going to attach braided line
to<00:00:02.610> a<00:00:02.639> fluorocarbon<00:00:03.270> leader<00:00:03.540> with<00:00:04.259> the<00:00:04.290> J<00:00:04.680> not

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:05.540 
to a fluorocarbon leader with the J not

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:09.049 
to a fluorocarbon leader with the J not
it's<00:00:06.540> probably<00:00:06.629> my<00:00:06.839> go-to<00:00:07.049> not<00:00:07.440> for<00:00:07.950> braid<00:00:08.790> to

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
it's probably my go-to not for braid to

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:12.049 
it's probably my go-to not for braid to
mono<00:00:09.510> or<00:00:09.809> fluorocarbon<00:00:10.590> it's<00:00:11.490> very<00:00:11.730> simple

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
mono or fluorocarbon it's very simple

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:13.700 
mono or fluorocarbon it's very simple
it's<00:00:12.360> going<00:00:12.480> to<00:00:12.540> be<00:00:12.630> a<00:00:12.660> uni<00:00:12.960> knot<00:00:13.080> on<00:00:13.259> one<00:00:13.349> side

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
it's going to be a uni knot on one side

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.790 
it's going to be a uni knot on one side
so<00:00:14.009> the<00:00:14.130> white<00:00:14.340> here<00:00:14.730> is<00:00:14.940> going<00:00:15.179> to<00:00:15.299> be<00:00:15.800> let's

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
so the white here is going to be let's

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.910 
so the white here is going to be let's
say<00:00:17.010> 30<00:00:17.699> 40<00:00:17.820> pound<00:00:18.330> fluorocarbon<00:00:18.900> the<00:00:19.680> pink

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
say 30 40 pound fluorocarbon the pink

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.349 
say 30 40 pound fluorocarbon the pink
going<00:00:20.430> to<00:00:20.520> be<00:00:20.930> 10<00:00:21.930> to<00:00:22.170> 20<00:00:22.439> pound<00:00:22.650> braid<00:00:23.609> okay

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
going to be 10 to 20 pound braid okay

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.330 
going to be 10 to 20 pound braid okay
I'll<00:00:24.900> show<00:00:25.170> you<00:00:25.230> with<00:00:25.410> this<00:00:25.590> first<00:00:25.980> and<00:00:26.310> then

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
I'll show you with this first and then

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.970 
I'll show you with this first and then
I'll<00:00:26.699> show<00:00:26.910> you<00:00:27.000> with<00:00:27.269> the<00:00:27.480> the<00:00:28.410> actual<00:00:28.769> line

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
I'll show you with the the actual line

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.130 
I'll show you with the the actual line
so<00:00:29.490> we're<00:00:29.609> going<00:00:29.699> to<00:00:29.789> tie<00:00:29.939> uni<00:00:30.330> knot<00:00:30.449> right

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
so we're going to tie uni knot right

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:37.450 
so we're going to tie uni knot right
here<00:00:31.199> one<00:00:32.300> two<00:00:33.469> three<00:00:34.880> four<00:00:35.880> times<00:00:36.059> around<00:00:36.329> and

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:37.460 
here one two three four times around and

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:47.389 
here one two three four times around and
pull<00:00:38.460> that<00:00:38.610> tight<00:00:44.930> okay<00:00:45.930> and<00:00:46.170> then<00:00:46.829> on<00:00:47.129> this

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
pull that tight okay and then on this

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.700 
pull that tight okay and then on this
side<00:00:47.460> you<00:00:48.000> could<00:00:48.450> tie<00:00:48.629> another<00:00:48.899> uni<00:00:49.289> knot<00:00:49.410> here

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
side you could tie another uni knot here

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.770 
side you could tie another uni knot here
for<00:00:49.920> a<00:00:49.950> double<00:00:50.190> uni<00:00:50.399> but<00:00:50.969> what<00:00:51.059> I<00:00:51.090> prefer<00:00:51.480> to<00:00:51.600> do

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
for a double uni but what I prefer to do

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.220 
for a double uni but what I prefer to do
is<00:00:52.020> to<00:00:52.860> tie<00:00:53.070> and<00:00:53.430> improve<00:00:53.940> clinch<00:00:54.270> so<00:00:55.079> I'll

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
is to tie and improve clinch so I'll

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:01.569 
is to tie and improve clinch so I'll
move<00:00:55.379> it<00:00:55.530> over<00:00:55.620> here<00:00:55.770> one<00:00:56.930> two<00:00:58.039> three<00:01:00.440> four

00:01:01.569 --> 00:01:01.579 
move it over here one two three four

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:05.719 
move it over here one two three four
five<00:01:02.809> six<00:01:03.809> let's<00:01:04.170> do<00:01:04.500> seven<00:01:04.979> on<00:01:05.220> this<00:01:05.489> but

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
five six let's do seven on this but

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.460 
five six let's do seven on this but
sometimes<00:01:06.030> I'll<00:01:06.330> do<00:01:06.450> as<00:01:06.540> many<00:01:06.720> as<00:01:06.840> 12<00:01:07.170> with

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
sometimes I'll do as many as 12 with

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.320 
sometimes I'll do as many as 12 with
braid<00:01:07.799> and<00:01:08.130> I'll<00:01:08.760> put<00:01:08.909> it<00:01:09.000> right<00:01:09.030> through

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
braid and I'll put it right through

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.920 
braid and I'll put it right through
there<00:01:09.600> and<00:01:09.979> right<00:01:10.979> back<00:01:11.189> through<00:01:11.490> there<00:01:11.700> and<00:01:12.180> I

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
there and right back through there and I

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.969 
there and right back through there and I
will<00:01:13.140> draw<00:01:13.380> this<00:01:13.560> down<00:01:15.320> doesn't<00:01:16.320> work<00:01:16.530> quite

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
will draw this down doesn't work quite

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.570 
will draw this down doesn't work quite
as<00:01:17.159> good<00:01:17.400> as<00:01:18.229> fluorocarbon<00:01:19.229> on<00:01:19.619> the<00:01:19.979> braid<00:01:20.220> but

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
as good as fluorocarbon on the braid but

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.580 
as good as fluorocarbon on the braid but
I'll<00:01:20.970> show<00:01:21.240> you<00:01:21.299> how<00:01:21.570> it<00:01:21.720> will<00:01:21.979> pull<00:01:22.979> down<00:01:24.590> and

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
I'll show you how it will pull down and

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.850 
I'll show you how it will pull down and
then<00:01:26.340> we'll<00:01:26.520> look<00:01:26.670> at<00:01:26.850> it<00:01:27.000> with<00:01:27.150> the<00:01:27.299> real<00:01:27.860> the

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
then we'll look at it with the real the

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.969 
then we'll look at it with the real the
real<00:01:28.890> deal<00:01:29.450> so<00:01:30.450> that's<00:01:30.659> it<00:01:30.930> you<00:01:31.200> need<00:01:31.380> not<00:01:31.530> to

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
real deal so that's it you need not to

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.719 
real deal so that's it you need not to
an<00:01:32.250> improved<00:01:32.700> clinch<00:01:33.140> will<00:01:34.140> just<00:01:34.409> simply<00:01:34.860> trim

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
an improved clinch will just simply trim

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:40.310 
an improved clinch will just simply trim
off<00:01:35.909> the<00:01:36.119> tag<00:01:36.360> ends<00:01:38.150> right<00:01:39.150> here<00:01:39.210> this<00:01:40.079> is<00:01:40.290> a

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
off the tag ends right here this is a

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.149 
off the tag ends right here this is a
knot<00:01:40.590> that<00:01:40.619> I<00:01:42.290> have<00:01:43.290> a<00:01:43.350> lot<00:01:43.500> of<00:01:43.590> confidence<00:01:44.009> in

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
knot that I have a lot of confidence in

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:48.050 
knot that I have a lot of confidence in
it's<00:01:44.880> a<00:01:45.030> I<00:01:45.420> like<00:01:45.990> it<00:01:46.200> because<00:01:46.950> it<00:01:47.460> offers<00:01:47.820> kind

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
it's a I like it because it offers kind

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.039 
it's a I like it because it offers kind
of<00:01:48.119> a<00:01:48.240> ramp<00:01:48.540> on<00:01:48.869> this<00:01:49.740> side<00:01:49.979> so<00:01:50.340> that<00:01:50.369> the<00:01:51.049> knot

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
of a ramp on this side so that the knot

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:53.600 
of a ramp on this side so that the knot
if<00:01:52.320> it<00:01:52.439> ever<00:01:52.590> does<00:01:52.770> come<00:01:53.009> inside<00:01:53.340> and<00:01:53.490> outside

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
if it ever does come inside and outside

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.760 
if it ever does come inside and outside
of<00:01:53.820> the<00:01:53.939> guides<00:01:54.149> it<00:01:54.750> doesn't<00:01:55.170> really<00:01:55.500> get

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
of the guides it doesn't really get

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.539 
of the guides it doesn't really get
caught<00:01:56.040> on<00:01:56.280> the<00:01:56.579> guides<00:01:56.939> and<00:01:58.189> just<00:01:59.189> generally

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
caught on the guides and just generally

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.580 
caught on the guides and just generally
pretty<00:01:59.790> strong<00:02:00.060> so<00:02:00.659> the<00:02:00.869> way<00:02:00.990> that<00:02:01.020> looks

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
pretty strong so the way that looks

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:08.350 
pretty strong so the way that looks
with<00:02:02.390> fluorocarbon<00:02:03.390> and<00:02:03.600> braid<00:02:04.759> here<00:02:05.759> we<00:02:05.909> have
