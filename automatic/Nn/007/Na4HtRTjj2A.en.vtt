00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
to the VG threes I've actually got a

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:20.440 
to the VG threes I've actually got a
pair<00:02:18.600> out<00:02:18.810> here<00:02:19.200> now<00:02:19.740> what<00:02:19.950> you'll<00:02:20.130> notice

pair out here now what you'll notice

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:22.820 
pair out here now what you'll notice
initially<00:02:21.450> right<00:02:21.870> off<00:02:22.020> the<00:02:22.140> bat<00:02:22.320> is<00:02:22.530> that

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
initially right off the bat is that

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:24.680 
initially right off the bat is that
there's<00:02:23.190> a<00:02:23.250> lot<00:02:23.460> more<00:02:23.580> surface<00:02:23.940> area<00:02:24.300> to<00:02:24.510> the

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
there's a lot more surface area to the

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:27.290 
there's a lot more surface area to the
VG<00:02:24.930> 3<00:02:25.170> there's<00:02:25.380> a<00:02:25.410> lot<00:02:25.530> more<00:02:25.770> I<00:02:25.980> guess<00:02:26.370> finger

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
VG 3 there's a lot more I guess finger

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.390 
VG 3 there's a lot more I guess finger
expanding<00:02:27.870> to<00:02:28.350> get<00:02:28.500> your<00:02:28.650> hands<00:02:29.010> around<00:02:29.160> the

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
expanding to get your hands around the

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.120 
expanding to get your hands around the
ball<00:02:29.580> and<00:02:29.760> Don<00:02:30.090> on<00:02:30.510> the<00:02:31.230> radio<00:02:31.530> cut<00:02:31.770> ones<00:02:31.950> on

ball and Don on the radio cut ones on

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:33.440 
ball and Don on the radio cut ones on
cells<00:02:32.430> ones<00:02:32.670> it<00:02:32.820> seems<00:02:32.970> like<00:02:33.180> it's<00:02:33.300> a<00:02:33.360> little

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
cells ones it seems like it's a little

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.180 
cells ones it seems like it's a little
more<00:02:33.690> for<00:02:33.900> the<00:02:33.990> fit<00:02:34.350> then<00:02:34.620> more<00:02:34.860> of<00:02:34.890> the

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
more for the fit then more of the

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.940 
more for the fit then more of the
surface<00:02:35.790> area<00:02:36.030> to<00:02:36.180> catch<00:02:36.209> the<00:02:36.570> ball<00:02:36.800> there<00:02:37.800> are

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
surface area to catch the ball there are

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.120 
surface area to catch the ball there are
there<00:02:38.610> are<00:02:38.730> obviously<00:02:39.150> similarities<00:02:40.130> they

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
there are obviously similarities they

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:43.160 
there are obviously similarities they
both<00:02:41.430> rolled<00:02:41.850> all<00:02:42.180> the<00:02:42.420> way<00:02:42.510> to<00:02:42.570> the<00:02:42.750> back<00:02:42.900> hand

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
both rolled all the way to the back hand

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.850 
both rolled all the way to the back hand
the<00:02:43.920> fingers<00:02:44.280> but<00:02:44.700> Nikes<00:02:45.480> goes<00:02:45.990> the<00:02:46.590> whole<00:02:46.800> way

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
the fingers but Nikes goes the whole way

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.699 
the fingers but Nikes goes the whole way
down<00:02:47.130> the<00:02:47.280> finger<00:02:47.610> on<00:02:47.930> the<00:02:48.930> inside<00:02:49.290> rather

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
down the finger on the inside rather

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:51.650 
down the finger on the inside rather
than<00:02:49.890> the<00:02:50.010> cells<00:02:50.340> on<00:02:50.610> where<00:02:50.760> they<00:02:50.970> were<00:02:51.510> they

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
than the cells on where they were they

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.300 
than the cells on where they were they
still<00:02:51.930> have<00:02:52.020> stitching<00:02:52.530> on<00:02:52.709> the<00:02:52.800> top<00:02:53.040> and<00:02:53.250> the

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
still have stitching on the top and the

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.370 
still have stitching on the top and the
bottom<00:02:53.580> and<00:02:53.670> then<00:02:54.239> in<00:02:54.420> between<00:02:54.540> that<00:02:55.020> it<00:02:55.140> rolls

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 
bottom and then in between that it rolls

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:56.990 
bottom and then in between that it rolls
over<00:02:55.590> it's<00:02:55.860> obviously<00:02:56.160> like<00:02:56.489> I<00:02:56.550> said<00:02:56.730> a<00:02:56.760> very

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
over it's obviously like I said a very

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.670 
over it's obviously like I said a very
small<00:02:57.450> one<00:02:57.660> on<00:02:57.780> the<00:02:57.900> pinky<00:02:58.200> there's<00:02:58.410> actually

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
small one on the pinky there's actually

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.860 
small one on the pinky there's actually
stitching<00:02:59.010> on<00:02:59.370> the<00:03:00.090> roll<00:03:00.330> right<00:03:00.600> there<00:03:00.660> I

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
stitching on the roll right there I

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:02.810 
stitching on the roll right there I
don't<00:03:00.959> know<00:03:01.140> if<00:03:01.230> you<00:03:01.320> can<00:03:01.410> see<00:03:01.620> that<00:03:01.800> but<00:03:02.730> yeah

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:02.820 
don't know if you can see that but yeah

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:04.280 
don't know if you can see that but yeah
I<00:03:02.850> would<00:03:03.030> actually<00:03:03.180> go<00:03:03.450> as<00:03:03.600> far<00:03:03.780> as<00:03:03.930> to<00:03:04.050> say<00:03:04.260> the

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
I would actually go as far as to say the

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.350 
I would actually go as far as to say the
cells<00:03:04.830> ones<00:03:05.070> are<00:03:05.220> better<00:03:05.430> made<00:03:05.730> it<00:03:05.940> seems<00:03:06.180> that

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
cells ones are better made it seems that

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.000 
cells ones are better made it seems that
they<00:03:06.480> made<00:03:06.660> that<00:03:06.959> they've<00:03:07.140> used<00:03:07.170> much<00:03:07.590> much

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
they made that they've used much much

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:09.410 
they made that they've used much much
better<00:03:08.160> materials<00:03:08.700> as<00:03:08.910> you<00:03:08.940> can<00:03:09.120> see<00:03:09.300> this

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
better materials as you can see this
