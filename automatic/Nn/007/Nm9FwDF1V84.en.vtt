this<00:00:01.949> is<00:00:02.159> the<00:00:02.340> e<00:00:02.610> 90<00:00:03.210> key<00:00:03.659> holder<00:00:04.080> just<00:00:05.069> arrived

00:00:05.329 --> 00:00:05.339 
this is the e 90 key holder just arrived

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:07.639 
this is the e 90 key holder just arrived
today<00:00:05.810> and<00:00:06.810> I<00:00:06.960> thought<00:00:07.140> I'd<00:00:07.259> make<00:00:07.290> a<00:00:07.410> video

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
today and I thought I'd make a video

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:09.350 
today and I thought I'd make a video
explain<00:00:08.160> how<00:00:08.340> it<00:00:08.429> work<00:00:08.580> because<00:00:08.700> quite<00:00:09.330> a

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
explain how it work because quite a

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.749 
explain how it work because quite a
quite<00:00:09.990> amazing<00:00:10.380> this<00:00:10.889> is<00:00:10.950> the<00:00:11.099> faceplate<00:00:11.309> also

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
quite amazing this is the faceplate also

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:17.150 
quite amazing this is the faceplate also
I've<00:00:11.880> already<00:00:12.150> removed<00:00:14.870> now<00:00:15.870> take<00:00:16.770> it<00:00:16.890> apart

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
I've already removed now take it apart

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.710 
I've already removed now take it apart
you<00:00:17.279> just<00:00:17.400> take<00:00:17.580> this<00:00:17.730> thing<00:00:17.789> off<00:00:18.150> which<00:00:18.570> I've

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
you just take this thing off which I've

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.240 
you just take this thing off which I've
already<00:00:18.840> taken<00:00:19.050> apart<00:00:19.439> nothing's<00:00:19.859> being<00:00:20.010> held

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
already taken apart nothing's being held

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:21.910 
already taken apart nothing's being held
together<00:00:20.340> right<00:00:20.760> now

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:21.920 
together right now

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:26.120 
together right now
then<00:00:22.920> take<00:00:23.220> this<00:00:23.400> piece<00:00:23.670> out<00:00:25.010> explain<00:00:26.010> all

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
then take this piece out explain all

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.419 
then take this piece out explain all
these<00:00:26.250> pieces<00:00:26.640> later<00:00:26.930> and<00:00:28.070> then<00:00:29.070> you<00:00:29.220> take

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
these pieces later and then you take

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.790 
these pieces later and then you take
this<00:00:29.580> piece<00:00:29.849> the<00:00:30.150> circuit<00:00:30.510> board<00:00:30.720> out<00:00:30.869> it's

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
this piece the circuit board out it's

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.380 
this piece the circuit board out it's
not<00:00:32.099> really<00:00:32.430> much<00:00:32.550> of<00:00:32.610> a<00:00:32.820> circuit<00:00:33.149> board<00:00:33.329> as

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
not really much of a circuit board as

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.510 
not really much of a circuit board as
you<00:00:33.450> can<00:00:33.600> see<00:00:36.350> those<00:00:37.350> were<00:00:37.590> it's<00:00:38.129> quite

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
you can see those were it's quite

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.479 
you can see those were it's quite
interesting<00:00:38.850> all<00:00:39.239> the<00:00:39.300> mechanics<00:00:40.460> now<00:00:41.460> I

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
interesting all the mechanics now I

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.069 
interesting all the mechanics now I
started<00:00:41.879> noticing<00:00:42.030> there<00:00:42.329> was<00:00:42.420> no<00:00:42.600> buttons<00:00:42.960> or

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
started noticing there was no buttons or

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:44.360 
started noticing there was no buttons or
anything<00:00:43.440> in<00:00:43.530> here<00:00:43.800> so<00:00:43.950> I<00:00:44.010> was<00:00:44.129> kind<00:00:44.340> of

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
anything in here so I was kind of

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:45.920 
anything in here so I was kind of
wondering<00:00:44.640> how<00:00:45.059> it<00:00:45.180> worked

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
wondering how it worked

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.440 
wondering how it worked
of<00:00:46.530> course<00:00:46.800> this<00:00:47.010> right<00:00:47.190> here<00:00:47.520> is<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:47.820> RFID

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
of course this right here is the RFID

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.319 
of course this right here is the RFID
antenna<00:00:48.750> it's<00:00:49.710> probably<00:00:50.280> also<00:00:50.700> used<00:00:51.030> to

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
antenna it's probably also used to

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:59.380 
antenna it's probably also used to
charge<00:00:51.629> the<00:00:52.199> key<00:00:53.899> from<00:00:54.899> wireless<00:00:55.320> electricity

00:00:59.380 --> 00:00:59.390 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:02.090 

now<00:01:00.390> what<00:01:00.600> happens<00:01:01.050> when<00:01:01.230> you<00:01:01.350> insert<00:01:01.649> the<00:01:01.859> key

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
now what happens when you insert the key

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:09.080 
now what happens when you insert the key
into<00:01:02.129> it<00:01:04.280> watch<00:01:05.280> down<00:01:05.610> here<00:01:07.729> you<00:01:08.729> see<00:01:08.939> this

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
into it watch down here you see this

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.590 
into it watch down here you see this
piece<00:01:09.360> appears<00:01:10.700> and<00:01:11.700> I<00:01:11.790> notice<00:01:12.090> that<00:01:12.119> those

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
piece appears and I notice that those

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.570 
piece appears and I notice that those
are<00:01:12.869> probably<00:01:13.290> magnets<00:01:13.950> and<00:01:14.130> after<00:01:14.369> sticking

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
are probably magnets and after sticking

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.719 
are probably magnets and after sticking
screwdriver<00:01:15.299> on<00:01:15.479> it<00:01:15.780> I<00:01:16.020> kind<00:01:16.979> of<00:01:17.040> figured<00:01:17.640> out

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
screwdriver on it I kind of figured out

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.249 
screwdriver on it I kind of figured out
it<00:01:17.880> was<00:01:18.090> because<00:01:18.119> you<00:01:18.570> can't<00:01:18.780> really<00:01:19.020> really

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
it was because you can't really really

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.280 
it was because you can't really really
pull<00:01:19.560> a<00:01:19.590> screwdriver<00:01:20.009> off<00:01:20.930> and<00:01:21.930> that's<00:01:22.110> when<00:01:22.259> I

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
pull a screwdriver off and that's when I

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.749 
pull a screwdriver off and that's when I
noticed<00:01:22.740> that<00:01:22.830> these<00:01:23.280> right<00:01:23.640> here<00:01:25.520> lined<00:01:26.520> up

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
noticed that these right here lined up

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:32.990 
noticed that these right here lined up
with<00:01:26.909> those<00:01:27.030> magnets<00:01:27.570> as<00:01:28.500> you<00:01:28.740> can<00:01:28.890> see<00:01:32.000> now

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
with those magnets as you can see now

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.789 
with those magnets as you can see now
what<00:01:33.210> these<00:01:33.420> are<00:01:33.780> the<00:01:34.110> probably<00:01:34.409> Hall<00:01:34.650> effect

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
what these are the probably Hall effect

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.390 
what these are the probably Hall effect
sensors<00:01:35.430> they're<00:01:35.850> used<00:01:36.030> to<00:01:36.180> detect<00:01:36.630> magnets

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:37.400 
sensors they're used to detect magnets

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.590 
sensors they're used to detect magnets
and<00:01:38.400> as<00:01:38.579> you<00:01:38.700> can<00:01:38.759> see<00:01:38.939> when<00:01:39.090> I<00:01:39.119> push<00:01:39.360> down<00:01:39.390> on

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
and as you can see when I push down on

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.950 
and as you can see when I push down on
the<00:01:39.810> key<00:01:40.049> that<00:01:40.979> magnet<00:01:41.460> moves<00:01:41.759> have<00:01:42.750> you<00:01:42.869> ever

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
the key that magnet moves have you ever

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.830 
the key that magnet moves have you ever
driven<00:01:43.200> at<00:01:43.439> a<00:01:43.560> 90<00:01:44.070> when<00:01:44.970> you<00:01:45.060> push<00:01:45.240> the<00:01:45.390> key<00:01:45.630> in

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
driven at a 90 when you push the key in

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.080 
driven at a 90 when you push the key in
in<00:01:46.140> order<00:01:46.350> to<00:01:46.439> release<00:01:46.740> it<00:01:47.040> you<00:01:47.340> push<00:01:47.640> the<00:01:47.909> key

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
in order to release it you push the key

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:54.440 
in order to release it you push the key
down<00:01:48.329> and<00:01:48.659> then<00:01:49.530> it<00:01:49.649> releases<00:01:49.950> it<00:01:52.970> so<00:01:53.970> what's

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
down and then it releases it so what's

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.359 
down and then it releases it so what's
happening<00:01:54.990> is<00:01:55.200> as<00:01:55.409> soon<00:01:55.590> as<00:01:55.649> you<00:01:55.740> insert<00:01:56.219> the

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
happening is as soon as you insert the

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.030 
happening is as soon as you insert the
key<00:01:56.549> that<00:01:56.759> magnet<00:01:57.119> appears<00:01:57.420> there<00:01:57.719> and<00:01:58.040> then

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
key that magnet appears there and then

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:04.789 
key that magnet appears there and then
the<00:01:59.909> car<00:02:00.119> is<00:02:00.149> able<00:02:00.390> to<00:02:00.630> detect<00:02:00.899> the<00:02:02.659> key<00:02:03.659> is<00:02:04.320> in

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
the car is able to detect the key is in

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.069 
the car is able to detect the key is in
and<00:02:05.670> then<00:02:05.759> when<00:02:05.880> you<00:02:05.939> push<00:02:06.119> down<00:02:06.149> on<00:02:06.479> it<00:02:06.840> the

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
and then when you push down on it the

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:10.609 
and then when you push down on it the
magnet<00:02:07.920> pulls<00:02:08.129> away<00:02:08.690> from<00:02:09.690> this<00:02:09.869> and<00:02:10.349> it's

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
magnet pulls away from this and it's

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:14.510 
magnet pulls away from this and it's
able<00:02:10.800> to<00:02:11.430> know<00:02:12.270> the<00:02:12.510> release<00:02:12.780> the<00:02:12.989> key<00:02:13.340> now<00:02:14.340> how

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520 
able to know the release the key now how

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:17.180 
able to know the release the key now how
does<00:02:14.580> it<00:02:14.849> release<00:02:15.150> and<00:02:15.599> hold<00:02:16.110> the<00:02:16.319> key<00:02:16.530> in<00:02:16.739> is

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
does it release and hold the key in is

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.790 
does it release and hold the key in is
with<00:02:17.400> this<00:02:17.550> piece<00:02:17.819> here<00:02:18.290> well<00:02:19.290> this<00:02:19.410> is<00:02:19.620> right

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
with this piece here well this is right

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.940 
with this piece here well this is right
here<00:02:20.099> is<00:02:20.220> an<00:02:20.370> electric<00:02:20.700> magnet<00:02:21.349> you<00:02:22.349> notice<00:02:22.560> it

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
here is an electric magnet you notice it

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.380 
here is an electric magnet you notice it
wasn't<00:02:23.400> right<00:02:23.580> there<00:02:24.290> now<00:02:25.290> when<00:02:25.440> this<00:02:25.620> thing

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
wasn't right there now when this thing

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:29.710 
wasn't right there now when this thing
when<00:02:27.390> you<00:02:27.480> turn<00:02:27.629> the<00:02:27.750> electric<00:02:28.050> magnet<00:02:28.349> on

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
when you turn the electric magnet on

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:34.000 
when you turn the electric magnet on
this<00:02:30.720> piece<00:02:30.959> right<00:02:31.140> here<00:02:31.610> pours<00:02:32.610> itself<00:02:32.970> down

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
this piece right here pours itself down

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:38.720 
this piece right here pours itself down
and<00:02:35.010> with<00:02:35.519> that<00:02:35.700> thing<00:02:35.970> down<00:02:37.069> the<00:02:38.069> key<00:02:38.340> can't

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
and with that thing down the key can't

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:43.070 
and with that thing down the key can't
be<00:02:38.910> removed<00:02:41.330> probably<00:02:42.330> want<00:02:42.510> it's<00:02:42.720> not<00:02:42.900> coming

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
be removed probably want it's not coming

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.040 
be removed probably want it's not coming
out

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:45.050 
out

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:48.530 
out
but<00:02:46.050> with<00:02:46.170> that<00:02:46.319> thing<00:02:46.560> up<00:02:46.769> like<00:02:47.129> so<00:02:47.910> sees

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
but with that thing up like so sees

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:53.210 
but with that thing up like so sees
pushed<00:02:48.810> up<00:02:49.250> then<00:02:50.250> key<00:02:51.060> comes<00:02:51.269> up<00:02:52.069> pretty<00:02:53.069> much

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
pushed up then key comes up pretty much

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:58.550 
pushed up then key comes up pretty much
crazy<00:02:56.090> so<00:02:57.090> that's<00:02:57.360> pretty<00:02:57.840> much<00:02:57.930> how<00:02:58.080> it<00:02:58.349> works

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
crazy so that's pretty much how it works

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.050 
crazy so that's pretty much how it works
and<00:02:58.739> of<00:02:58.860> course<00:02:59.040> when<00:02:59.190> the<00:02:59.370> magnets<00:02:59.700> point<00:02:59.970> it

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
and of course when the magnets point it

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:03.259 
and of course when the magnets point it
down<00:03:00.349> this<00:03:01.349> magnet<00:03:01.860> here<00:03:02.340> the<00:03:02.760> electric<00:03:03.120> man

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:03.269 
down this magnet here the electric man

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:06.490 
down this magnet here the electric man
is<00:03:03.420> pointed<00:03:03.750> out<00:03:03.890> this<00:03:04.890> magnet<00:03:05.340> here<00:03:05.760> is

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
is pointed out this magnet here is

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:10.910 
is pointed out this magnet here is
closer<00:03:07.500> to<00:03:07.980> this<00:03:08.459> mass<00:03:09.450> effect<00:03:09.870> sensor<00:03:10.590> here

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
closer to this mass effect sensor here

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:13.190 
closer to this mass effect sensor here
and<00:03:11.879> that<00:03:12.030> knows<00:03:12.269> that<00:03:12.569> it's<00:03:12.720> blocking<00:03:12.989> the

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
and that knows that it's blocking the

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.119 
and that knows that it's blocking the
key<00:03:13.379> in<00:03:13.530> place<00:03:15.349> but<00:03:16.349> that's<00:03:16.560> pretty<00:03:16.709> much<00:03:16.920> how

00:03:17.119 --> 00:03:17.129 
key in place but that's pretty much how

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:20.630 
key in place but that's pretty much how
all<00:03:17.580> that<00:03:17.909> works<00:03:18.209> so<00:03:19.170> it<00:03:19.379> should<00:03:19.650> be<00:03:19.800> able<00:03:19.950> to<00:03:20.129> I

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 
all that works so it should be able to I

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.610 
all that works so it should be able to I
should<00:03:21.569> be<00:03:21.690> able<00:03:21.840> to<00:03:21.930> interface<00:03:22.140> it<00:03:22.319> with<00:03:22.530> the

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
should be able to interface it with the

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:25.009 
should be able to interface it with the
e39<00:03:23.040> pretty<00:03:23.400> easily<00:03:23.670> the<00:03:24.659> only<00:03:24.810> thing<00:03:24.930> I'm

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:25.019 
e39 pretty easily the only thing I'm

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:28.160 
e39 pretty easily the only thing I'm
worried<00:03:25.319> about<00:03:25.379> is<00:03:25.830> the<00:03:26.790> RFID<00:03:27.569> antenna<00:03:27.690> here

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
worried about is the RFID antenna here

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:31.640 
worried about is the RFID antenna here
I'm<00:03:28.890> hoping<00:03:29.340> it's<00:03:29.909> the<00:03:30.090> same<00:03:30.420> inductance<00:03:31.349> as

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
I'm hoping it's the same inductance as

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:35.420 
I'm hoping it's the same inductance as
the<00:03:33.170> antenna<00:03:34.170> in<00:03:34.319> the<00:03:34.409> e39<00:03:34.799> that<00:03:35.159> way<00:03:35.250> I<00:03:35.280> can

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
the antenna in the e39 that way I can

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.369 
the antenna in the e39 that way I can
just<00:03:35.459> use<00:03:35.730> this<00:03:35.970> and<00:03:36.299> cut<00:03:36.480> the<00:03:36.659> one<00:03:37.140> out<00:03:37.260> of<00:03:37.290> the

00:03:37.369 --> 00:03:37.379 
just use this and cut the one out of the

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:40.910 
just use this and cut the one out of the
e39<00:03:37.769> if<00:03:38.640> not<00:03:39.120> I'm<00:03:39.959> gonna<00:03:40.230> have<00:03:40.319> to<00:03:40.470> get<00:03:40.650> more

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
e39 if not I'm gonna have to get more

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:44.570 
e39 if not I'm gonna have to get more
creative<00:03:41.549> and<00:03:41.879> figure<00:03:42.510> out<00:03:42.690> how<00:03:43.049> to<00:03:43.110> mount<00:03:43.580> the

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:44.580 
creative and figure out how to mount the

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:48.380 
creative and figure out how to mount the
e39<00:03:45.030> isn't<00:03:45.420> anyone<00:03:45.780> here<00:03:46.670> but<00:03:47.670> that's<00:03:48.239> how

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:48.390 
e39 isn't anyone here but that's how

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:50.690 
e39 isn't anyone here but that's how
that<00:03:48.450> works
