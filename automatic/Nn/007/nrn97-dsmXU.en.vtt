with<00:04:32.289> hdmi<00:04:32.800> you'll<00:04:33.009> have<00:04:33.099> to<00:04:33.219> use<00:04:33.400> a<00:04:33.430> hdmi

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:34.180 
with hdmi you'll have to use a hdmi

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:36.270 
with hdmi you'll have to use a hdmi
splitter<00:04:34.389> for<00:04:34.659> this<00:04:34.810> device<00:04:35.110> but<00:04:35.740> you're<00:04:36.039> able

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:36.280 
splitter for this device but you're able

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:37.950 
splitter for this device but you're able
to<00:04:36.370> do<00:04:36.460> that<00:04:36.610> in<00:04:36.729> the<00:04:36.819> core<00:04:37.000> gameplay<00:04:37.030> um

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:41.830 
the idea behind you when it was

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:43.230

00:04:47.399 --> 00:04:47.409 
I'm sure I was expected to be a few

00:04:47.409 --> 00:04:49.140 
I'm sure I was expected to be a few
selected<00:04:47.770> titles<00:04:48.129> up<00:04:48.280> but<00:04:48.460> I<00:04:48.490> kind<00:04:48.789> of<00:04:48.849> wanted

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:49.150 
selected titles up but I kind of wanted

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:50.249 
selected titles up but I kind of wanted
a<00:04:49.240> little<00:04:49.449> bit<00:04:49.569> more<00:04:49.659> titles<00:04:50.050> on<00:04:50.199> the

00:04:50.249 --> 00:04:50.259 
a little bit more titles on the

00:04:50.259 --> 00:04:52.679 
a little bit more titles on the
PlayStation<00:04:51.250> TV<00:04:51.400> to<00:04:51.939> be<00:04:52.060> compatible<00:04:52.360> which

00:04:52.679 --> 00:04:52.689 
PlayStation TV to be compatible which

00:04:52.689 --> 00:04:54.600 
PlayStation TV to be compatible which
don't<00:04:52.930> even<00:04:53.110> require<00:04:53.259> any<00:04:53.770> sort<00:04:54.129> of<00:04:54.189> form<00:04:54.430> of

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:54.610 
don't even require any sort of form of

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:56.700 
don't even require any sort of form of
you<00:04:55.000> know<00:04:55.120> touchscreen<00:04:55.629> or<00:04:55.870> rear<00:04:56.050> touchpad<00:04:56.229> so

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:56.710 
you know touchscreen or rear touchpad so

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:57.929 
you know touchscreen or rear touchpad so
that<00:04:56.860> would<00:04:56.949> have<00:04:57.039> been<00:04:57.129> a<00:04:57.310> little<00:04:57.610> bit<00:04:57.789> nice

00:04:57.929 --> 00:04:57.939 
that would have been a little bit nice

00:04:57.939 --> 00:05:00.899 
that would have been a little bit nice
also<00:04:58.840> the<00:04:59.439> fact<00:04:59.620> that<00:04:59.740> you<00:04:59.889> can<00:05:00.099> use<00:05:00.490> something

00:05:00.899 --> 00:05:00.909 
also the fact that you can use something

00:05:00.909 --> 00:05:02.129 
also the fact that you can use something
like<00:05:00.939> YouTube<00:05:01.360> or<00:05:01.479> any<00:05:01.599> sort<00:05:01.750> of<00:05:01.870> like<00:05:01.990> you

00:05:02.129 --> 00:05:02.139 
like YouTube or any sort of like you

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:03.869 
like YouTube or any sort of like you
know<00:05:02.169> app<00:05:02.409> you<00:05:03.099> know<00:05:03.219> related<00:05:03.639> video

00:05:03.869 --> 00:05:03.879 
know app you know related video

00:05:03.879 --> 00:05:05.850 
know app you know related video
streaming<00:05:04.150> is<00:05:04.409> ridiculous<00:05:05.409> because<00:05:05.590> it

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:05.860 
streaming is ridiculous because it

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:07.350 
streaming is ridiculous because it
should<00:05:06.069> be<00:05:06.189> compatible<00:05:06.460> they<00:05:06.909> should<00:05:07.090> be<00:05:07.240> no

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:07.360 
should be compatible they should be no

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:09.600 
should be compatible they should be no
problem<00:05:07.750> though<00:05:07.900> but<00:05:08.139> once<00:05:08.710> again<00:05:08.830> the<00:05:09.159> third

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:09.610 
problem though but once again the third

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:11.159 
problem though but once again the third
party<00:05:09.969> has<00:05:10.090> to<00:05:10.120> go<00:05:10.330> back<00:05:10.539> and<00:05:10.569> kind<00:05:10.810> of<00:05:10.960> change

00:05:11.159 --> 00:05:11.169 
party has to go back and kind of change

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:12.480 
party has to go back and kind of change
stuff<00:05:11.379> and<00:05:11.590> they<00:05:11.650> haven't<00:05:11.919> done<00:05:11.979> it<00:05:12.189> right<00:05:12.310> now

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:12.490 
stuff and they haven't done it right now

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:15.209 
stuff and they haven't done it right now
and<00:05:12.729> the<00:05:13.569> interface<00:05:14.050> it's<00:05:14.650> the<00:05:14.800> same<00:05:14.949> thing<00:05:15.009> as

00:05:15.209 --> 00:05:15.219 
and the interface it's the same thing as

00:05:15.219 --> 00:05:16.920 
and the interface it's the same thing as
a<00:05:15.400> PlayStation<00:05:15.909> Vita<00:05:16.090> so<00:05:16.330> it<00:05:16.449> is<00:05:16.539> a<00:05:16.569> little<00:05:16.689> bit

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:16.930 
a PlayStation Vita so it is a little bit

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:18.839 
a PlayStation Vita so it is a little bit
weird<00:05:17.169> to<00:05:17.319> kind<00:05:17.560> of<00:05:17.590> you<00:05:17.710> know<00:05:17.740> get<00:05:18.430> adjusted

00:05:18.839 --> 00:05:18.849 
weird to kind of you know get adjusted

00:05:18.849 --> 00:05:20.550 
weird to kind of you know get adjusted
to<00:05:18.909> it<00:05:19.029> even<00:05:19.449> with<00:05:19.599> the<00:05:19.719> keyboard<00:05:19.930> i<00:05:20.229> think<00:05:20.469> the

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:20.560 
to it even with the keyboard i think the

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:21.749 
to it even with the keyboard i think the
keyboard<00:05:20.919> they<00:05:21.009> could<00:05:21.159> have<00:05:21.250> changed<00:05:21.520> it<00:05:21.580> up<00:05:21.639> a

00:05:21.749 --> 00:05:21.759 
keyboard they could have changed it up a

00:05:21.759 --> 00:05:23.850 
keyboard they could have changed it up a
little<00:05:21.909> bit<00:05:22.060> to<00:05:22.599> make<00:05:22.719> it<00:05:22.779> easier<00:05:23.229> to<00:05:23.409> type<00:05:23.560> and

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:23.860 
little bit to make it easier to type and

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:26.249 
little bit to make it easier to type and
all<00:05:23.949> that<00:05:24.129> when<00:05:24.580> using<00:05:24.849> a<00:05:24.909> dualshock<00:05:25.330> 4<00:05:25.360> now<00:05:26.199> as

00:05:26.249 --> 00:05:26.259 
all that when using a dualshock 4 now as

00:05:26.259 --> 00:05:28.529 
all that when using a dualshock 4 now as
know<00:05:26.770> for<00:05:26.979> a<00:05:27.009> mic<00:05:27.279> I<00:05:27.550> haven't<00:05:28.210> tried<00:05:28.330> it<00:05:28.419> yet

00:05:28.529 --> 00:05:28.539 
know for a mic I haven't tried it yet

00:05:28.539 --> 00:05:30.089 
know for a mic I haven't tried it yet
but<00:05:28.990> I'm<00:05:29.110> assuming<00:05:29.500> you<00:05:29.590> can<00:05:29.710> use<00:05:29.830> some<00:05:29.860> sort

00:05:30.089 --> 00:05:30.099 
but I'm assuming you can use some sort

00:05:30.099 --> 00:05:31.709 
but I'm assuming you can use some sort
of<00:05:30.159> Bluetooth<00:05:30.550> connection<00:05:31.389> within<00:05:31.569> the

00:05:31.709 --> 00:05:31.719 
of Bluetooth connection within the

00:05:31.719 --> 00:05:33.420 
of Bluetooth connection within the
PlayStation<00:05:32.169> TV<00:05:32.289> and<00:05:32.680> use<00:05:33.159> like<00:05:33.310> to

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:33.430 
PlayStation TV and use like to

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:35.180 
PlayStation TV and use like to
communicate<00:05:33.610> and<00:05:34.089> talk<00:05:34.210> to<00:05:34.389> your<00:05:34.509> people<00:05:34.719> but

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:35.190 
communicate and talk to your people but

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:38.010 
communicate and talk to your people but
as<00:05:36.190> of<00:05:36.250> right<00:05:36.400> now<00:05:36.580> that's<00:05:37.210> pretty<00:05:37.509> much<00:05:37.629> it<00:05:37.690> I

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:38.020 
as of right now that's pretty much it I

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:39.360 
as of right now that's pretty much it I
think<00:05:38.289> that<00:05:38.409> the<00:05:38.500> PlayStation<00:05:38.979> if<00:05:39.129> you<00:05:39.219> have

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:39.370 
think that the PlayStation if you have

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:41.369 
think that the PlayStation if you have
full<00:05:39.610> potential<00:05:40.120> but<00:05:40.629> it's<00:05:40.810> kind<00:05:41.110> of<00:05:41.169> bare

00:05:41.369 --> 00:05:41.379 
full potential but it's kind of bare

00:05:41.379 --> 00:05:43.709 
full potential but it's kind of bare
bones<00:05:41.620> at<00:05:41.800> the<00:05:41.889> moment<00:05:42.219> and<00:05:42.360> the<00:05:43.360> only<00:05:43.539> people

00:05:43.709 --> 00:05:43.719 
bones at the moment and the only people

00:05:43.719 --> 00:05:46.110 
bones at the moment and the only people
I<00:05:43.960> can<00:05:44.169> see<00:05:44.349> using<00:05:44.889> this<00:05:45.129> extensively<00:05:45.729> is<00:05:45.969> that

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:46.120 
I can see using this extensively is that

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:47.850 
I can see using this extensively is that
they<00:05:46.210> have<00:05:46.300> three<00:05:46.599> titles<00:05:46.930> that<00:05:47.020> they<00:05:47.139> cannot

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:47.860 
they have three titles that they cannot

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:49.740 
they have three titles that they cannot
wait<00:05:48.039> to<00:05:48.129> record<00:05:48.430> I<00:05:48.460> could<00:05:48.610> kill<00:05:48.819> zone<00:05:49.060> or<00:05:49.300> you

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:49.750 
wait to record I could kill zone or you

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:51.749 
wait to record I could kill zone or you
know<00:05:49.930> some<00:05:50.319> sort<00:05:50.500> of<00:05:50.529> game<00:05:50.650> like<00:05:50.800> that<00:05:51.039> but

00:05:51.749 --> 00:05:51.759 
know some sort of game like that but

00:05:51.759 --> 00:05:53.430 
know some sort of game like that but
overall<00:05:52.120> I<00:05:52.180> think<00:05:52.419> you<00:05:52.569> can<00:05:52.750> pass<00:05:52.960> on<00:05:53.169> this<00:05:53.319> I

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:53.440 
overall I think you can pass on this I

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:55.769 
overall I think you can pass on this I
give<00:05:53.620> this<00:05:53.710> a<00:05:53.860> 7<00:05:54.219> out<00:05:54.759> of<00:05:54.849> 10<00:05:55.150> I<00:05:55.360> mean<00:05:55.509> it's<00:05:55.689> a
