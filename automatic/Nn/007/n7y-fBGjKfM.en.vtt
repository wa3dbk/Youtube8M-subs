reason the way bionics designed this

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:22.460 
reason the way bionics designed this
they<00:00:21.359> put<00:00:21.510> a<00:00:21.570> giant<00:00:21.869> direct<00:00:22.230> drive<00:00:22.410> motor

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
they put a giant direct drive motor

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.160 
they put a giant direct drive motor
inside<00:00:22.980> a<00:00:23.039> composite<00:00:23.369> shell<00:00:23.789> the<00:00:24.600> design<00:00:24.960> here

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
inside a composite shell the design here

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:26.330 
inside a composite shell the design here
is<00:00:25.230> really<00:00:25.619> smart

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
is really smart

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.250 
is really smart
traditional<00:00:27.180> hub<00:00:27.330> motors<00:00:27.599> use<00:00:27.750> the<00:00:27.900> shell<00:00:28.140> of

traditional hub motors use the shell of

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:29.599 
traditional hub motors use the shell of
the<00:00:28.349> motor<00:00:28.529> itself<00:00:28.859> to<00:00:29.070> support<00:00:29.400> the<00:00:29.490> weight

the motor itself to support the weight
of<00:00:29.640> the<00:00:29.730> bike<00:00:29.910> this<00:00:30.869> design<00:00:31.260> is<00:00:31.410> like<00:00:31.529> a

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
of the bike this design is like a

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.560 
of the bike this design is like a
traditional<00:00:32.160> wheel<00:00:32.309> with<00:00:32.880> the<00:00:32.969> motor<00:00:33.180> inside

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
traditional wheel with the motor inside

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.930 
traditional wheel with the motor inside
it<00:00:34.350> allows<00:00:34.620> them<00:00:34.860> to<00:00:35.010> use<00:00:35.130> a<00:00:35.160> composite<00:00:35.550> shell

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
it allows them to use a composite shell

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.760 
it allows them to use a composite shell
instead<00:00:36.270> of<00:00:36.510> metal<00:00:36.750> which<00:00:37.170> is<00:00:37.200> about<00:00:37.500> two

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
instead of metal which is about two

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.410 
instead of metal which is about two
pounds<00:00:37.950> lighter<00:00:38.340> than<00:00:38.579> an<00:00:38.790> all-metal<00:00:39.090> shell

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
pounds lighter than an all-metal shell

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.170 
pounds lighter than an all-metal shell
it<00:00:40.200> also<00:00:40.350> keeps<00:00:40.680> the<00:00:40.860> motor<00:00:41.010> cool<00:00:41.340> it's

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
it also keeps the motor cool it's

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.240 
it also keeps the motor cool it's
physically<00:00:42.840> huge<00:00:43.320> which<00:00:43.559> translates<00:00:44.129> into

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
physically huge which translates into

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.340 
physically huge which translates into
loads<00:00:44.789> of<00:00:45.030> torque

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
loads of torque

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.920 
loads of torque
so<00:00:46.860> this<00:00:47.070> would<00:00:47.250> work<00:00:47.400> on<00:00:47.579> a<00:00:47.610> street<00:00:47.910> bike<00:00:48.120> it's

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
so this would work on a street bike it's

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.680 
so this would work on a street bike it's
ideally<00:00:49.500> suited<00:00:49.530> for<00:00:49.920> a<00:00:49.980> mountain<00:00:50.250> bike<00:00:50.690> it

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
ideally suited for a mountain bike it

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.180 
ideally suited for a mountain bike it
