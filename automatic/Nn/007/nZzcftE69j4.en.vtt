00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:09.589
 Hello, I want to tell you today 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.589
 a little flashlight of their submarine 

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:15.330
 2 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:20.720
 well basically good flashlight mrs 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.720
 allen by uncomfortable big massive 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:27.529
 using just for followed translation 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:32.090
 grandfathers here are two kinds 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:37.469
 you can namely as it is called 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:38.910
 810 is one of the old model, this one already 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:42.270
 modernized 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:46.160
 last year this flashlight 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:51.270
 chinese somehow 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:54.140
 south view file f2 as elementary too 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:59.270
 principle in the daytime to highlight 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:01:03.840
 under the snag minutes convenient button here 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:07.590
 devote from where day hunting some 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.220
 a cave cave you watch it 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.189
 using 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:16.409
 everywhere else in these flashlights this one 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:19.710
 old generally my first lantern too 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:23.390
 good by the way on the LED bizim 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.390
 here are these communicators 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:33.810
 there are chargers for them they are interchangeable 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:35.980
 also keeps good well they are 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.500
 poor quality of the good here these 

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:46.240
 strong well let's postpone everything and 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:48.490
 a couple being boyish they are here at first 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.460
 2 identical flashlights from this 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:54.840
 old sample this one but what's the difference 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:58.810
 let's start with a pike perch easier to unscrew 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:00.250
 a larger thread pitch here is a new one 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.860
 old 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:04.000
 the thread is small and in the cold when 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:08.470
 hands are numb 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:16.270
 there is a change of batteries but a little bit of 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:20.370
 it's a little difficult for me to switch to 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:23.710
 old old model that 's all smooth 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.370
 switched and while hunting somewhere 

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:27.340
 accounting 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:30.600
 as if moving there were no fixes here 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:33.840
 they are already more often then there is a fixation 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:38.459
 specifically three modes and they are fixed 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:41.459
 more convenient for 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:41.459
 spotlights 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:55.230
 it turns out by the LEDs that the LED 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:58.410
 there that there is a cree xm-l 1 100 lumen and not 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:02.550
 not so many thousands of people as 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:03.180
 here is this test 3 320 night time with them 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:10.250
 a little bit 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:12.830
 but in this flashlights these are still used 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:16.760
 glass 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:20.430
 light filter is also a cool thing 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:22.950
 they are in the muddy water of i.e. three species 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:25.020
 there is do it will call without but here 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:28.020
 this yellow heat is yellow 

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:32.300
 light filter it gives muddy water well how 

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:35.700
 Seeing around 20 microparticles 

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:37.050
 possible family I think that this is the most 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:42.420
 so successful 

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:44.670
 and budget model lights for underwater 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:47.430
 hunting many hunters stopped 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:54.680
 it is on these lights that they are in principle 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:04:00.900
 lightweight they are cheap well limits somewhere 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:04:03.810
 60 dollars worth depending on 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:06.090
 picking is repaired everything is very 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:07.740
 In principle, there you can change the LED 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:10.260
 also become criminal guilt 

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:15.690
 ten days a little more than 10 dollars 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:19.830
 I will not understand it here right now 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:24.770
 two batteries 2 batteries immediately tell you about 

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:24.770
 imperfections it turns out 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:42.500
 the LED itself the LED it works in 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:42.500
 In this mode, I'll show you here as well. 

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:59.370
 I do not know that I did not shove batteries 

00:04:55.189 --> 00:05:02.909
 see what the salt of lack is that 

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:05.189
 He does not have such a flashlight 

00:05:02.909 --> 00:05:08.909
 that he shines worse worse worse then 

00:05:05.189 --> 00:05:13.020
 it goes out, it burns and burns itself 

00:05:08.909 --> 00:05:16.409
 all the cracks are 

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:19.169
 what you need average mode there for four hours 

00:05:16.409 --> 00:05:21.900
 I know he swims normally after 4 hours I 

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:25.889
 I understand that we need somewhere for 

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:27.080
 tie with fishing out well with me 

00:05:25.889 --> 00:05:29.789
 always with you 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:30.749
 pockets still a small lantern that is to say 

00:05:29.789 --> 00:05:34.050
 just in case 

00:05:30.749 --> 00:05:38.039
 sighs the main swim to the car there 

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:43.409
 you can steam to the shore if it is night but 

00:05:38.039 --> 00:05:46.620
 the rest of the flashlight bomb let's say so well I 

00:05:43.409 --> 00:05:48.839
 I think if with my colleagues all such 

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:50.430
 lanterns and bought perry meditated 

00:05:48.839 --> 00:05:55.540
 like me too 

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:56.980
 but stopped and the boys if they 

00:05:55.540 --> 00:06:03.690
 smaller structures 

00:05:56.980 --> 00:06:08.280
 Well, they are with you a little bit like this 

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:08.280
 I advise you all for now
