00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:04.530
 in such a way 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.950

 millions and it is the greatest movement 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:17.790
 In this sense then it is possible to have a 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.100
 the very great big 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.150

 today we have 4 million here on the São Paulo avenue 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.020
 every time I hear 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.290
 in this car 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:34.840
 Stop rachel I cry a lot 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.840
 for last year I cried for the senator about himself 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.010
 filipe sure that this year I'm going to cry again 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:44.010
 because we were fighting 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:45.580
 Oh my God 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:47.570
 victorious is too much 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:50.740
 It's my life, the way I mean it. 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.740
 I'm very proud 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:57.250
 can you have any idea how significant this is 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.520
 this movement is wonderful 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.190
 it meant a lot 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:08.599
 I think 80% of the time of my 

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:10.199
 of my life 

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:11.429
 the most up to 

00:02:11.429 --> 00:02:12.409
 I i i 

00:02:12.409 --> 00:02:16.049
 I'm very delighted so I say I go out in the official car always 

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:17.739
 because I think that 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:20.759
 has to mean 

00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:23.069
 Why do you want to score today? 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:25.649
 ask for that I do not permit 

00:02:25.649 --> 00:02:27.389
 the player I think 

00:02:27.389 --> 00:02:29.889
 we have a purpose in this parade 

00:02:29.889 --> 00:02:31.289
 and this proposal 

00:02:31.289 --> 00:02:34.509
 has to be maintained 

00:02:34.509 --> 00:02:37.509
 we can let it be used 

00:02:39.109 --> 00:02:42.109
 Who is this the purpose of the parade? 

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:49.759
 taken to the last consequence 

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:56.319
 a girl to say 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:57.979
 while I have 

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:58.979
 your attack 

00:02:58.979 --> 00:03:00.419
 I take his life. 

00:03:00.419 --> 00:03:02.959
 to this end 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:05.869
 raise saying these things 

00:03:05.869 --> 00:03:08.869
 it seems they do it again and again 

00:03:08.869 --> 00:03:11.869
 this is part 

00:03:13.899 --> 00:03:15.900
 and you found the participation of children 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.900
 couples of all ages and the entire public of all ages 

00:03:21.219 --> 00:03:24.349
 I also lived there 

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:29.649
 it seems that this is an important cash message having resided adversities 

00:03:29.649 --> 00:03:31.909
 I think it's saying the following we 

00:03:31.909 --> 00:03:34.909
 the action of all colors 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:39.209
 but it was our message and 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:42.209
 I asked him for our response to violence 

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:45.129
 homophobia 

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:46.619
 r already dead 

00:03:46.619 --> 00:03:50.419
 we do not respond to violence with violence we respond to 

00:03:50.419 --> 00:03:53.419
 violence with a kiss a hug 

00:03:54.289 --> 00:03:57.289
 he answered 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:24.080
 only one position
