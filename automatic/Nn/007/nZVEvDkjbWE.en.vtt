master slave just get one XLR cable
don't<00:02:49.129> plug<00:02:49.819> them<00:02:49.940> together<00:02:50.239> and<00:02:50.599> then<00:02:50.930> you're

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:51.079 
don't plug them together and then you're

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:53.199 
don't plug them together and then you're
running<00:02:51.319> these<00:02:51.410> two<00:02:51.680> things<00:02:51.950> DMX<00:02:52.670> must<00:02:52.879> slave

running these two things DMX must slave

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:54.460 
running these two things DMX must slave
to<00:02:53.359> the<00:02:53.450> both<00:02:53.599> of<00:02:53.690> them<00:02:53.780> do<00:02:53.870> the<00:02:53.959> same<00:02:54.170> thing

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 
to the both of them do the same thing

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:55.690 
to the both of them do the same thing
and<00:02:54.739> it's<00:02:54.980> going<00:02:55.069> to<00:02:55.129> make<00:02:55.220> your<00:02:55.310> light<00:02:55.519> show

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
and it's going to make your light show

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:56.890 
and it's going to make your light show
that<00:02:55.819> much<00:02:55.940> more<00:02:56.090> professional<00:02:56.390> or<00:02:56.750> much<00:02:56.870> more

that much more professional or much more

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:00.069 
that much more professional or much more
programmed<00:02:58.510> so<00:02:59.510> you<00:02:59.569> see<00:02:59.660> what<00:02:59.780> I<00:02:59.810> mean<00:02:59.870> it's

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:00.079 
programmed so you see what I mean it's

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:01.330 
programmed so you see what I mean it's
kind<00:03:00.230> of<00:03:00.260> difficult<00:03:00.440> for<00:03:00.709> you<00:03:00.769> to<00:03:00.799> explain<00:03:01.069> to

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:01.340 
kind of difficult for you to explain to
