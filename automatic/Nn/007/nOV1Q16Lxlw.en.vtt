instead<00:00:20.640> of<00:00:20.760> stopping<00:00:21.180> our<00:00:21.750> workers<00:00:22.199> and

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:22.910 
instead of stopping our workers and

00:03:37.899 --> 00:03:37.909 
depose here at the same time because

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:39.490 
depose here at the same time because
we're<00:03:38.090> getting<00:03:38.209> really<00:03:38.389> close<00:03:38.720> to<00:03:39.079> the<00:03:39.139> supply

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:39.500 
we're getting really close to the supply

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.080 
we're getting really close to the supply
of<00:03:39.530> here<00:03:39.769> so<00:03:39.980> around<00:03:40.189> thirty<00:03:40.519> supply<00:03:40.909> you're

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.090 
of here so around thirty supply you're

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:42.610 
of here so around thirty supply you're
going<00:03:41.209> to<00:03:41.269> want<00:03:41.389> to<00:03:41.480> drop<00:03:41.599> to<00:03:41.900> supply<00:03:42.290> depots

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:42.620 
going to want to drop to supply depots

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:44.500 
going to want to drop to supply depots
does<00:03:43.189> he<00:03:43.310> have<00:03:43.340> six<00:03:43.639> barracks<00:03:43.970> producing

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:44.510 
does he have six barracks producing

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:45.909 
does he have six barracks producing
rains<00:03:44.750> so<00:03:44.930> it's<00:03:45.049> going<00:03:45.169> to<00:03:45.260> clog<00:03:45.500> up<00:03:45.709> along

00:03:45.909 --> 00:03:45.919 
rains so it's going to clog up along

00:03:54.759 --> 00:03:54.769 
workers you could probably take a couple

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:57.610 
workers you could probably take a couple
more<00:03:55.190> even<00:03:55.669> one<00:03:55.819> less<00:03:56.030> if<00:03:56.209> you<00:03:56.299> like<00:03:56.510> and<00:03:56.810> we're

amount of time possible you also notice
that<00:04:13.549> we're<00:04:13.849> moving<00:04:14.180> out<00:04:14.299> 15<00:04:15.019> to<00:04:15.169> 20<00:04:15.319> seconds

that we're moving out 15 to 20 seconds

00:04:15.919 --> 00:04:18.759 
that we're moving out 15 to 20 seconds
earlier<00:04:16.639> then<00:04:17.329> the<00:04:17.510> bronze<00:04:17.750> build<00:04:18.109> and<00:04:18.349> we're

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:18.769 
earlier then the bronze build and we're

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:20.620 
earlier then the bronze build and we're
also<00:04:18.889> taking<00:04:19.159> some<00:04:19.549> workers<00:04:20.030> with<00:04:20.209> us<00:04:20.389> which

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:20.630 
also taking some workers with us which

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:22.659 
also taking some workers with us which
is<00:04:20.659> going<00:04:20.900> to<00:04:20.959> give<00:04:21.019> us<00:04:21.169> a<00:04:21.409> huge<00:04:21.799> meat<00:04:22.310> shield

00:04:22.659 --> 00:04:22.669 
is going to give us a huge meat shield

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:25.300 
is going to give us a huge meat shield
bonus<00:04:23.060> so<00:04:23.930> it's<00:04:24.050> going<00:04:24.169> to<00:04:24.229> be<00:04:24.320> a<00:04:24.409> lot<00:04:24.680> powerful

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:25.310 
bonus so it's going to be a lot powerful

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:26.800 
bonus so it's going to be a lot powerful
lot<00:04:25.490> more<00:04:25.669> powerful<00:04:25.970> and<00:04:26.210> you'll<00:04:26.330> build<00:04:26.479> a<00:04:26.630> bus

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:26.810 
lot more powerful and you'll build a bus

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:28.570 
lot more powerful and you'll build a bus
through<00:04:27.050> any<00:04:27.169> early<00:04:27.530> defenses<00:04:28.010> a<00:04:28.039> lot<00:04:28.310> easier

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:28.580 
through any early defenses a lot easier

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:30.760 
through any early defenses a lot easier
than<00:04:28.909> the<00:04:28.970> bronze<00:04:29.210> build<00:04:29.479> so<00:04:30.139> you<00:04:30.229> might<00:04:30.500> not

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:30.770 
than the bronze build so you might not

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:32.950 
than the bronze build so you might not
have<00:04:31.039> to<00:04:31.220> wait<00:04:31.400> to<00:04:31.610> build<00:04:31.760> up<00:04:31.909> units<00:04:32.240> depending
