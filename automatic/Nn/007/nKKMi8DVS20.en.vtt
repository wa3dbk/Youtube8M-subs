risen<00:02:21.590> for<00:02:22.040> an<00:02:22.130> hour<00:02:22.310> its<00:02:23.000> doubled<00:02:23.420> its<00:02:23.570> size<00:02:23.630> I

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
risen for an hour its doubled its size I

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:25.960 
risen for an hour its doubled its size I
actually<00:02:24.680> picked<00:02:25.130> at<00:02:25.310> it<00:02:25.459> a<00:02:25.549> little<00:02:25.700> bit<00:02:25.850> right

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
actually picked at it a little bit right

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:29.620 
actually picked at it a little bit right
here<00:02:26.239> and<00:02:26.420> it's<00:02:26.540> very<00:02:27.100> fluffy<00:02:28.100> very<00:02:28.790> like

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:29.630 
here and it's very fluffy very like

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:31.840 
here and it's very fluffy very like
light<00:02:29.930> and<00:02:29.959> airy<00:02:30.350> inside<00:02:30.769> so<00:02:31.370> I<00:02:31.400> think<00:02:31.489> this<00:02:31.730> is

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:31.850 
light and airy inside so I think this is

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:33.729 
light and airy inside so I think this is
gonna<00:02:32.000> turn<00:02:32.269> out<00:02:32.390> good

00:02:33.729 --> 00:02:33.739 
gonna turn out good

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:35.710 
gonna turn out good

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 
baking sheets are ready so the next step

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.560 
baking sheets are ready so the next step
I'm<00:02:57.769> going<00:02:58.070> to<00:02:58.250> do<00:02:58.400> is<00:02:58.670> go<00:02:58.940> ahead<00:02:59.060> and<00:02:59.299> cut<00:02:59.450> this

I'm going to do is go ahead and cut this
into<00:02:59.870> 12<00:03:00.230> pieces<00:03:01.180> so<00:03:02.180> that'll<00:03:02.450> make<00:03:02.570> 12

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
into 12 pieces so that'll make 12

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:05.770 
into 12 pieces so that'll make 12
pretzels<00:03:03.410> and<00:03:03.880> once<00:03:04.880> the<00:03:05.060> dough<00:03:05.209> is<00:03:05.239> divided

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:39.140 
I could cut through my dough all my
pieces<00:03:37.590> aren't<00:03:37.980> totally<00:03:38.400> even<00:03:38.910> but<00:03:39.030> that's

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:43.739 
divide it into 12 pieces was just kind

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:46.040 
divide it into 12 pieces was just kind
of<00:03:43.770> cut<00:03:44.010> it<00:03:44.099> in<00:03:44.280> a<00:03:44.670> pizza<00:03:44.880> shape<00:03:45.239> so<00:03:45.540> we<00:03:45.630> got<00:03:45.780> 12

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:46.050 
of cut it in a pizza shape so we got 12

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:47.890 
of cut it in a pizza shape so we got 12
slices<00:03:46.530> there<00:03:46.739> that<00:03:47.040> I<00:03:47.069> can<00:03:47.310> work<00:03:47.489> from

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:47.900 
slices there that I can work from

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:50.120 
slices there that I can work from
hopefully<00:03:48.900> from<00:03:49.050> this<00:03:49.260> angle<00:03:49.440> over<00:03:49.739> here<00:03:49.860> you

I'm<00:03:57.840> working<00:03:58.200> with<00:03:58.349> it<00:03:58.530> so<00:03:58.800> I'm<00:03:58.920> pretty

00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.220 
I'm working with it so I'm pretty

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:01.040 
I'm working with it so I'm pretty
excited<00:03:59.550> that<00:03:59.790> this<00:04:00.060> is<00:04:00.120> actually<00:04:00.690> gonna<00:04:00.810> turn

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:01.050 
excited that this is actually gonna turn

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:03.470 
excited that this is actually gonna turn
out<00:04:01.290> because<00:04:01.709> never<00:04:02.489> in<00:04:02.610> a<00:04:02.670> million<00:04:02.970> years<00:04:03.000> I

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:03.480 
out because never in a million years I

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:06.110 
out because never in a million years I
thought<00:04:03.690> that<00:04:03.750> I'd<00:04:04.290> be<00:04:04.440> making<00:04:05.120> small

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
thought that I'd be making small

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.600 
thought that I'd be making small
pretzels<00:04:06.660> like<00:04:06.870> homemade<00:04:07.140> soft<00:04:07.500> pretzels<00:04:07.950> at

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:12.630 
home so I am rolling these until they're

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:16.400 
home so I am rolling these until they're
kind<00:04:12.900> of<00:04:13.049> pencil<00:04:13.650> thin<00:04:14.989> just<00:04:15.989> takes<00:04:16.229> a<00:04:16.380> couple

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:16.410 
kind of pencil thin just takes a couple

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:20.120 
kind of pencil thin just takes a couple
minutes<00:04:16.739> to<00:04:17.250> kind<00:04:17.430> of<00:04:17.549> work<00:04:17.700> it<00:04:17.910> out<00:04:19.130> basically

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.130 
minutes to kind of work it out basically

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:21.800 
minutes to kind of work it out basically
want<00:04:20.400> to<00:04:20.459> start<00:04:20.760> from<00:04:20.910> the<00:04:21.060> center<00:04:21.090> and<00:04:21.419> kind

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810 
want to start from the center and kind

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:25.010 
want to start from the center and kind
of<00:04:21.930> push<00:04:22.320> outwards<00:04:22.830> lightly<00:04:23.520> and<00:04:23.820> that's<00:04:24.810> how

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:25.020 
of push outwards lightly and that's how

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:28.670

00:05:53.049 --> 00:05:53.059 
of have to carefully pick it up it's a

00:05:53.059 --> 00:05:55.899 
of have to carefully pick it up it's a
little<00:05:53.269> tricky<00:05:53.859> dip<00:05:54.859> it<00:05:55.009> into<00:05:55.159> this<00:05:55.459> solution

00:05:55.899 --> 00:05:55.909 
little tricky dip it into this solution

00:05:55.909 --> 00:06:00.219 
little tricky dip it into this solution
which<00:05:56.449> is<00:05:56.749> baking<00:05:57.439> soda<00:05:57.860> and<00:05:58.219> water<00:05:59.229> it's

00:06:00.219 --> 00:06:00.229 
which is baking soda and water it's

00:06:00.229 --> 00:06:02.949 
which is baking soda and water it's
going<00:06:01.099> to<00:06:01.399> kind<00:06:01.639> of<00:06:01.729> like<00:06:01.909> move<00:06:02.149> on<00:06:02.509> you<00:06:02.719> and

00:06:04.749 --> 00:06:04.759 
come apart just slightly but it's not a

00:06:04.759 --> 00:06:06.339 
come apart just slightly but it's not a
big<00:06:04.969> deal<00:06:05.149> you<00:06:05.329> can<00:06:05.419> reshape<00:06:05.659> it

00:06:06.339 --> 00:06:06.349 
big deal you can reshape it

00:06:06.349 --> 00:06:09.939 
big deal you can reshape it
once<00:06:07.159> you<00:06:07.279> set<00:06:07.519> up<00:06:07.699> your<00:06:08.649> parchment<00:06:09.649> lined
