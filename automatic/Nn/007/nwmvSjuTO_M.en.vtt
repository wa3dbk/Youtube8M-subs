00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.040
 hello everyone welcome today we are going to 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.880
 teach how to make raspberry jam 

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:27.210
 to make a raspberry jam 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.340
 that we are going to need granular sugar and 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.650
 raspberry in the proportion is the same 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.590
 we have half a kilo of sugar in half 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:37.200
 kilo of raspberries you will see that some 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:40.199
 recipes in which you are told to put 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:42.540
 in that you put some liquid that you 

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:44.910
 Incorporate to the best because the juice of 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.040
 some good citrus is not necessary 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.180
 there are also other recipes in which 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:52.870
 says you can leave 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:54.490
 sugar and raspberries together to 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:56.290
 that somehow they are releasing their 

00:00:54.490 --> 00:01:00.790
 liquid and then we pass it to the pot and 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:03.010
 let's give it the cooking blow either 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:04.839
 it is necessary it can be done but it does not 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:07.060
 missing this recipe we're going to do 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:10.300
 now it is easily extensible to the 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:13.150
 jam of blackberries to the jam of 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:15.550
 strawberries to all the jams of 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:17.380
 products that have a lot of 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:20.050
 a lot of liquid inside 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:22.930
 such as the raspberry 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:26.540
 very easy process we are going to give fire to 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:28.640
 our casserole and in it we are going to put 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:32.180
 the raspberries being careful not to pour 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:35.440
 none and until we're going to put 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.440
 also all the sugar 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:39.880
 with the help of a spatula or a 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:42.570
 wooden spoon in your house we go 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:42.570
 to go around 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:47.050
 and you will see how fast they are already starting to drop 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:49.710
 water and it occurs as a kind of 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:49.710
 Liquid candy 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:10.170
 we are at low fire 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:20.430
 and it's important that you go looking 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:23.290
 all sides of the casserole 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:26.459
 to avoid sugar remaining 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:29.920
 gluing without liquid contact and we were 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:31.780
 make candy and go picking color and 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:33.150
 then that has repercussions in that there is a 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.849
 taste 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.379
 somewhat bitter to the jam is 

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:39.030
 important to go around the 

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:40.739
 principle above all to avoid that 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.710
 no raspberry sticks to us 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:45.700
 casserole background 

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:45.700
 and burn us 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:50.370
 well, you see how fast it has already released 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:52.460
 the water and we will not have any 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:55.340
 problem 

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:57.720
 of grips or anything like that 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:00.300
 us on a scale 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:03.350
 from 1 to 12 we have it in number 6 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:05.990
 let's wait for it to boil 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:08.390
 and we're just going to let it cook for 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:11.000
 space of about 20 minutes which is the 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:13.430
 just enough time for us to have a 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.170
 Well structured marmalade 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:17.599
 once it has already raised well the 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:19.760
 boil that starts to create a foam and 

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:22.579
 in turn increase the volume due to 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:26.090
 that own foam that creates the property 

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:27.890
 cooking we're just going to go when 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:30.970
 in when 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:30.970
 giving some spin 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:34.650
 if we see that it is too strong for 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:39.180
 we simply go down and leave a 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:41.430
 lower boil that is simply with 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:44.700
 a boil 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:48.180
 very very very light let's wait 20 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:50.400
 minutes and we'll have it done 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:53.219
 Well, after 20 minutes 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:55.859
 You see he has what I was saying 

00:03:53.219 --> 00:03:58.530
 previously a very light boil not 

00:03:55.859 --> 00:04:02.359
 too strong is approximately 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:05.250
 for some between 105 the 110 degrees 

00:04:02.359 --> 00:04:07.110
 centigrade temperature 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:09.270
 well we would have done it past those 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:11.520
 20 minutes simply what we're going to 

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:13.370
 do is going to be serving here a small 

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:16.330
 portion 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:16.330
 refrigerate 

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:22.630
 and then we teach you 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:24.610
 the result 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:26.610
 good because we have had refrigerating 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:29.890
 for about three hours is already 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:34.450
 really cold and you're going to be the texture 

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:37.450
 that presents is perfect has chunks 

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:40.210
 more whole others less whole and a 

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:41.380
 color and a more fabulous shine we're going to 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:45.630
 show you here so you can 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:45.630
 appreciate it more easily 

00:04:51.849 --> 00:04:56.280
 how is it 

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:59.050
 our jam 

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:01.830
 the muddy 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:01.830
 look
