00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.450
 hello and welcome to 

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:08.450
 this video is about batteries and 

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:10.700
 Accumulator knowledge you should 

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:12.470
 the electrochemical stress-free and 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:13.610
 the concept of standard electrodes 

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:16.250
 know potential 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:17.690
 I want you to look at this 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:21.680
 a basic understanding for 

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:24.410
 battery and accumulator purchase the 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:26.930
 film consists of five sections 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:28.570
 first, chemical energy in electrical 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:31.550
 energy 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:37.390
 second, primary element and secondary 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:41.170
 element third, the battery fourth 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:43.700
 the accumulator and fifth 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:46.010
 Summary 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:48.710
 first, chemical energy in electrical 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:50.840
 energy around chemical energy in 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.940
 to convert electrical energy 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:55.310
 you need a high-energy 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:57.530
 Chemical connection You have to do this 

00:00:55.310 --> 00:01:00.160
 Connection force a suitable 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:03.440
 to undergo chemical reaction under 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:05.050
 Energy tax expires as a result 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:07.690
 you want a source of tension 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:10.340
 construct with which one gains power 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:12.740
 one of the first successful attempts 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:16.260
 to accomplish this was in the 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:19.020
 Construction of this galvanic cell 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:20.440
 once a copper dips into the vessel 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.840
 electrode 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:24.260
 The second electrode is a zinc 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:27.020
 electrode 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:30.170
 The copper electrode is immersed in a salt 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:33.050
 the copper two watches delivers the zig 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:38.440
 the full movie and many more 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:41.480
 you can find on sofatutor.com about 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:45.290
 7,000 videos tell you what you are up to 

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:48.440
 Good grades need to know about testing 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:50.930
 your knowledge after every video real 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:52.930
 Teachers help you in daily live chat 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:55.790
 immediately with your problem 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:57.770
 You can also attend private lessons 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:00.440
 Book your personal online tutor 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:03.620
 to dive deeper into a topic 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:05.500
 So we help you with your censorship without 

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:09.110
 great effort to improve
