00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.110 
right out of us am I making us do up
down<00:00:10.380> so<00:00:10.620> I<00:00:10.800> kind<00:00:11.280> of<00:00:11.310> snapped<00:00:11.460> guys<00:00:11.700> out<00:00:11.880> of<00:00:11.910> it

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
down so I kind of snapped guys out of it

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.210 
down so I kind of snapped guys out of it
and<00:00:12.240> threw<00:00:12.900> scallion<00:00:13.290> team<00:00:13.500> and<00:00:13.740> inside<00:00:14.040> run

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:14.220 
and threw scallion team and inside run

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:15.440 
and threw scallion team and inside run
really<00:00:14.490> picked<00:00:14.640> it<00:00:14.760> up<00:00:14.820> and<00:00:15.000> I<00:00:15.120> think<00:00:15.330> it

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
really picked it up and I think it

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.480 
really picked it up and I think it
turned<00:00:15.780> into<00:00:15.900> a<00:00:15.960> good<00:00:16.109> practice<00:00:16.439> first<00:00:17.310> time

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
really want to accomplish in these last

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.299 
really want to accomplish in these last
few<00:01:00.750> practices<00:01:01.350> uh<00:01:02.300> I'd<00:01:03.300> say<00:01:04.129> thinking<00:01:05.129> less

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
few practices uh I'd say thinking less

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.420 
few practices uh I'd say thinking less
and<00:01:05.549> playing<00:01:05.790> more<00:01:06.000> really<00:01:06.420> just<00:01:07.430> don't

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
and playing more really just don't

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:09.830 
and playing more really just don't
overstrain<00:01:08.850> kings<00:01:09.150> and<00:01:09.450> just<00:01:09.630> go<00:01:09.720> out<00:01:09.780> and

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
overstrain kings and just go out and

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:10.970 
overstrain kings and just go out and
play<00:01:09.960> because<00:01:10.260> that's<00:01:10.409> really<00:01:10.590> what<00:01:10.770> we<00:01:10.860> got

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:10.980 
play because that's really what we got

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:12.200 
play because that's really what we got
to<00:01:11.070> do<00:01:11.159> and<00:01:11.280> that's<00:01:11.430> when<00:01:11.580> we<00:01:11.670> play<00:01:11.880> our<00:01:11.909> best

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
to do and that's when we play our best

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.570 
to do and that's when we play our best
is<00:01:12.540> when<00:01:13.110> we're<00:01:13.290> doing<00:01:13.380> that<00:01:13.650> so<00:01:13.920> it's<00:01:14.400> we're

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
is when we're doing that so it's we're

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:15.710 
is when we're doing that so it's we're
coming<00:01:14.790> along<00:01:15.000> we're<00:01:15.150> getting<00:01:15.360> there<00:01:15.510> but

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
coming along we're getting there but

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.680 
coming along we're getting there but
we're<00:01:15.870> not<00:01:15.990> there<00:01:16.020> yet<00:01:16.520> how<00:01:17.520> much<00:01:17.730> foot<00:01:18.030> grasp

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:18.690 
we're not there yet how much foot grasp

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:20.120 
we're not there yet how much foot grasp
of<00:01:18.930> this<00:01:19.050> office<00:01:19.229> do<00:01:19.560> you<00:01:19.620> have<00:01:19.710> how<00:01:19.830> much<00:01:19.890> you

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.300 
have it put in it they put it in all of
it<00:01:21.960> if<00:01:22.110> you<00:01:22.350> think<00:01:22.680> about<00:01:22.710> halfway<00:01:23.010> through

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
it if you think about halfway through

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:24.649 
it if you think about halfway through
what's<00:01:23.700> your<00:01:23.909> that's<00:01:24.270> what<00:01:24.420> I've<00:01:24.510> heard<00:01:24.540> is

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
what's your that's what I've heard is

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.620 
what's your that's what I've heard is
that<00:01:24.780> we<00:01:24.900> put<00:01:25.050> in<00:01:25.140> all<00:01:25.229> of<00:01:25.380> it<00:01:25.500> so<00:01:25.740> I<00:01:26.600> get<00:01:27.600> a

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
that we put in all of it so I get a

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.810 
that we put in all of it so I get a
pretty<00:01:27.810> good<00:01:27.870> grasp<00:01:28.080> of<00:01:28.350> it<00:01:28.500> honestly<00:01:28.830> still

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
pretty good grasp of it honestly still

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.700 
pretty good grasp of it honestly still
