00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
don't know whether the MLP staff will

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.730 
don't know whether the MLP staff will
ever<00:01:17.640> try<00:01:17.970> introducing<00:01:18.750> that<00:01:18.869> story<00:01:19.320> element

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
however there is a way to talk about

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.950 
however there is a way to talk about
loss<00:01:22.799> without<00:01:23.400> going<00:01:23.790> so<00:01:24.000> far<00:01:24.299> as<00:01:24.360> to<00:01:24.509> include

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
loss without going so far as to include

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.679

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
first saw Tirek destroy Twilight's home

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.469 
first saw Tirek destroy Twilight's home
I<00:01:30.689> was<00:01:31.110> stunned<00:01:31.500> that<00:01:31.890> library<00:01:32.850> had<00:01:33.030> been<00:01:33.180> part

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
I was stunned that library had been part

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.480 
I was stunned that library had been part
of<00:01:33.540> the<00:01:33.630> show<00:01:33.840> since<00:01:34.170> the<00:01:34.350> very<00:01:34.680> first<00:01:34.770> episode

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
of the show since the very first episode

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.969 
of the show since the very first episode
and<00:01:35.729> so<00:01:36.240> many<00:01:36.509> of<00:01:36.689> Twilight's<00:01:37.229> stories<00:01:37.770> have

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
and so many of Twilight's stories have

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.580 
and so many of Twilight's stories have
taken<00:01:38.310> place<00:01:38.490> there<00:01:38.610> the<00:01:39.479> trees<00:01:39.780> destruction

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
taken place there the trees destruction

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.039 
taken place there the trees destruction
led<00:01:40.890> into<00:01:41.040> a<00:01:41.159> very<00:01:41.610> satisfying<00:01:42.329> fight<00:01:42.750> scene

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
led into a very satisfying fight scene

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.350 
led into a very satisfying fight scene
between<00:01:43.079> Twilight<00:01:43.920> and<00:01:44.100> Tirek<00:01:44.520> but<00:01:44.970> the<00:01:45.090> fact

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
between Twilight and Tirek but the fact

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.330 
between Twilight and Tirek but the fact
that<00:01:45.479> no<00:01:45.810> one<00:01:46.049> made<00:01:46.290> any<00:01:46.500> mention<00:01:47.250> of

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
that no one made any mention of

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.310 
that no one made any mention of
Twilight's<00:01:47.909> loss<00:01:48.240> throughout<00:01:48.659> the<00:01:48.869> rest<00:01:49.170> of

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
Twilight's loss throughout the rest of
