something creative who knows he could be

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:01.639

using some of the temples perhaps on

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.580

is<00:03:06.210> natural<00:03:06.630> it<00:03:06.690> looks<00:03:06.750> like<00:03:06.930> he's<00:03:07.050> actually

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
is natural it looks like he's actually

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.140 
is natural it looks like he's actually
taking<00:03:07.530> it<00:03:07.830> the<00:03:08.100> back<00:03:08.310> natural<00:03:08.760> the<00:03:08.880> mineral

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
taking it the back natural the mineral

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:10.640 
taking it the back natural the mineral
only<00:03:09.270> so<00:03:09.600> that's<00:03:09.990> going<00:03:10.170> to<00:03:10.230> slow<00:03:10.380> him<00:03:10.470> down<00:03:10.500> a

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
only so that's going to slow him down a

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.830 
only so that's going to slow him down a
little<00:03:10.770> bit<00:03:11.130> and<00:03:11.310> meanwhile<00:03:12.120> taza<00:03:12.390> has<00:03:12.630> gotten

little bit and meanwhile taza has gotten

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.750 
little bit and meanwhile taza has gotten
the<00:03:12.900> most<00:03:12.990> economic<00:03:13.500> build<00:03:13.680> you<00:03:13.830> can<00:03:14.070> possibly

the most economic build you can possibly

that<00:03:21.120> is<00:03:21.600> the<00:03:21.750> build<00:03:22.020> order<00:03:22.290> they<00:03:22.440> can<00:03:22.590> do<00:03:22.770> and

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
that is the build order they can do and

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:25.430 
that is the build order they can do and
it<00:03:23.820> will<00:03:24.000> get<00:03:24.180> up<00:03:24.390> those<00:03:24.720> cannons<00:03:25.020> will<00:03:25.140> get<00:03:25.290> up

it will get up those cannons will get up

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.050 
it will get up those cannons will get up
in<00:03:25.620> time<00:03:25.830> and<00:03:26.100> looks<00:03:26.250> like<00:03:26.370> over<00:03:26.580> sky<00:03:26.700> actually

there he's not going to go for
speedlings<00:03:32.730> he's<00:03:32.820> gone<00:03:32.970> for<00:03:33.209> the<00:03:33.240> three<00:03:33.720> hatch

speedlings he's gone for the three hatch
build<00:03:34.170> over<00:03:34.770> pull<00:03:34.950> into<00:03:35.070> three<00:03:35.370> hatch<00:03:35.550> so<00:03:36.300> he

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
build over pull into three hatch so he

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:38.600 
build over pull into three hatch so he
just<00:03:36.600> wants<00:03:36.840> to<00:03:36.930> basically<00:03:37.080> forced<00:03:37.650> taza<00:03:37.860> into

just wants to basically forced taza into

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:41.510 
just wants to basically forced taza into
building<00:03:38.970> a<00:03:39.060> couple<00:03:39.420> of<00:03:39.690> cannons<00:03:40.370> before<00:03:41.370> you

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:41.520 
building a couple of cannons before you

actually<00:03:43.830> this<00:03:43.920> is<00:03:44.070> he<00:03:44.190> one<00:03:44.310> for<00:03:44.430> the

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:44.490 
actually this is he one for the

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:45.860 
actually this is he one for the
expansion<00:03:44.640> first<00:03:44.970> but<00:03:45.090> he<00:03:45.209> you<00:03:45.390> know<00:03:45.510> forces

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
expansion first but he you know forces

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:48.199 
expansion first but he you know forces
and<00:03:46.020> play<00:03:46.170> keep<00:03:46.709> himself<00:03:46.860> honest<00:03:47.310> go<00:03:48.000> for<00:03:48.150> the

and play keep himself honest go for the
cannons<00:03:48.540> and<00:03:48.750> you<00:03:49.380> know<00:03:49.470> I<00:03:49.500> wouldn't<00:03:49.800> say

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:49.890 
cannons and you know I wouldn't say

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:51.320 
cannons and you know I wouldn't say

this<00:03:51.480> build<00:03:51.990> is<00:03:52.230> very<00:03:52.440> um<00:03:52.680> over<00:03:53.459> pull<00:03:53.670> into

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:53.820 
this build is very um over pull into

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
this kind of Forge fans expand and it's

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:00.500 
this kind of Forge fans expand and it's
going<00:03:59.400> to<00:03:59.490> be<00:03:59.550> about<00:03:59.640> killing<00:04:00.000> off<00:04:00.090> this<00:04:00.240> probe

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
going to be about killing off this probe

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:01.670 
going to be about killing off this probe
though<00:04:00.660> he<00:04:00.810> needs<00:04:00.990> to<00:04:01.080> kill<00:04:01.260> off<00:04:01.320> this<00:04:01.440> probe

though he needs to kill off this probe
obviously<00:04:02.160> we'll<00:04:02.880> see<00:04:03.000> how<00:04:03.090> good<00:04:03.240> tosses

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:03.690 
obviously we'll see how good tosses

obviously we'll see how good tosses
probe<00:04:03.990> micro<00:04:04.380> is<00:04:04.530> be<00:04:05.040> sooo<00:04:05.250> of<00:04:05.370> course<00:04:05.610> is<00:04:05.760> the

probe micro is be sooo of course is the

enemy<00:04:07.980> bases<00:04:08.280> we'll<00:04:08.580> see<00:04:08.700> if<00:04:08.790> taza<00:04:09.000> is<00:04:09.930> as<00:04:10.230> good

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.530 
enemy bases we'll see if taza is as good

taza<00:04:14.790> he's<00:04:15.180> playing<00:04:15.450> pretty<00:04:15.750> standard<00:04:16.200> here

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:16.410 
taza he's playing pretty standard here

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:18.650 
taza he's playing pretty standard here
and<00:04:17.220> we'll<00:04:17.549> see<00:04:17.730> what<00:04:17.880> he<00:04:18.000> detects<00:04:18.330> into<00:04:18.600> it

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:18.660 
and we'll see what he detects into it

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:19.580 
and we'll see what he detects into it
looks<00:04:18.780> like<00:04:18.870> the<00:04:18.959> probes<00:04:19.169> actually<00:04:19.440> out<00:04:19.560> of

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:19.590 
looks like the probes actually out of

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:21.380 
looks like the probes actually out of
the<00:04:19.709> base<00:04:19.859> here<00:04:20.100> so<00:04:20.340> here<00:04:21.030> we<00:04:21.120> have<00:04:21.180> the

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:21.390 
the base here so here we have the

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:23.000 
the base here so here we have the
opportunity<00:04:21.840> for<00:04:21.989> over<00:04:22.229> sky<00:04:22.410> to<00:04:22.470> try

opportunity for over sky to try

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:24.650 
opportunity for over sky to try
something<00:04:23.220> different<00:04:23.490> we'll<00:04:24.270> see<00:04:24.419> what<00:04:24.540> it<00:04:24.630> is

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:24.660 
something different we'll see what it is

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:27.110 
something different we'll see what it is
though<00:04:24.930> over<00:04:25.919> sky<00:04:26.040> looks<00:04:26.220> like<00:04:26.340> he's<00:04:26.550> still

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.120 
though over sky looks like he's still

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:27.350 
though over sky looks like he's still
hasn't

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 
hasn't

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.149 
hasn't
morphed<00:04:27.900> as<00:04:28.020> Larry<00:04:28.289> yet<00:04:28.469> maybe<00:04:28.650> he's<00:04:28.889> going<00:04:29.099> to

00:04:29.149 --> 00:04:29.159 
morphed as Larry yet maybe he's going to

00:04:29.159 --> 00:04:32.719 
morphed as Larry yet maybe he's going to
go<00:04:29.370> for<00:04:29.729> speedlings<00:04:30.659> first<00:04:30.930> and<00:04:31.400> we<00:04:32.400> could<00:04:32.580> see

00:04:32.719 --> 00:04:32.729 
go for speedlings first and we could see

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:34.339 
go for speedlings first and we could see
a<00:04:32.759> lot<00:04:33.180> of<00:04:33.210> possibilities<00:04:33.659> here<00:04:34.020> we<00:04:34.110> could<00:04:34.259> be

00:04:34.339 --> 00:04:34.349 
a lot of possibilities here we could be

00:04:34.349 --> 00:04:36.559 
a lot of possibilities here we could be
seeing<00:04:34.469> a<00:04:34.590> standard<00:04:34.949> built<00:04:35.159> which<00:04:35.879> from<00:04:36.449> this
