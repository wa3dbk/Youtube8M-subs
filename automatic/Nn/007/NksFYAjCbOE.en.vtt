the time on TV so a lot of people are
aware<00:00:13.320> of<00:00:13.559> it<00:00:14.990> I'm<00:00:15.990> a<00:00:16.109> little<00:00:16.350> bit<00:00:16.470> torn<00:00:16.770> on

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
aware of it I'm a little bit torn on

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.060 
aware of it I'm a little bit torn on
exactly<00:00:17.369> how<00:00:17.580> to<00:00:17.609> rate<00:00:17.970> this<00:00:18.210> product

exactly how to rate this product

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:21.980 
exactly how to rate this product
basically<00:00:20.070> I<00:00:20.460> had<00:00:20.789> three<00:00:21.090> requirements<00:00:21.840> I

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
basically I had three requirements I

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.349 
basically I had three requirements I
wanted<00:00:22.500> to<00:00:22.590> watch<00:00:22.740> a<00:00:23.100> few<00:00:23.430> old<00:00:23.699> television

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
wanted to watch a few old television

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.089 
wanted to watch a few old television
shows<00:00:24.600> I<00:00:24.810> really<00:00:25.080> like<00:00:25.289> that<00:00:25.529> I<00:00:25.769> haven't<00:00:25.949> been

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
shows I really like that I haven't been

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.400 
shows I really like that I haven't been
able<00:00:26.189> to<00:00:26.279> find<00:00:26.430> anywhere<00:00:26.880> for<00:00:27.090> years<00:00:27.480> so<00:00:28.199> those

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
able to find anywhere for years so those

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.479 
able to find anywhere for years so those
were<00:00:28.619> Barney<00:00:29.130> Miller<00:00:29.630> WKRP<00:00:30.630> and<00:00:31.189> Hill<00:00:32.189> Street

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
were Barney Miller WKRP and Hill Street

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.670 
were Barney Miller WKRP and Hill Street
Blues<00:00:32.550> and<00:00:33.239> so<00:00:33.360> I<00:00:33.420> figured<00:00:33.690> if<00:00:33.989> I<00:00:34.079> got<00:00:34.260> this<00:00:34.469> for

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
Blues and so I figured if I got this for

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.680 
Blues and so I figured if I got this for
$10<00:00:35.280> and<00:00:35.520> I<00:00:35.579> could<00:00:35.790> get<00:00:36.000> those<00:00:36.149> three<00:00:36.450> shows

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
$10 and I could get those three shows

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.780 
$10 and I could get those three shows
running<00:00:37.050> then<00:00:37.770> that<00:00:38.100> would<00:00:38.250> be<00:00:38.340> pretty<00:00:38.520> good

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
running then that would be pretty good

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.880 
running then that would be pretty good
and<00:00:39.090> I<00:00:39.420> was<00:00:39.570> able<00:00:39.690> to<00:00:39.840> do<00:00:39.989> that<00:00:40.140> no<00:00:40.320> problem

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
and I was able to do that no problem

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.770 
and I was able to do that no problem
I<00:00:41.040> actually<00:00:41.250> downloaded<00:00:42.000> this<00:00:42.480> thing<00:00:42.690> in

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
I actually downloaded this thing in

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:00.280 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:06.690 

a<00:01:04.170> lot<00:01:05.170> of<00:01:05.199> people<00:01:05.590> felt<00:01:05.830> like<00:01:06.100> it's<00:01:06.430> not<00:01:06.670> a

a lot of people felt like it's not a
very<00:01:06.970> good<00:01:07.180> value<00:01:07.720> because<00:01:08.260> it<00:01:08.680> really

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:09.070 
very good value because it really

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:10.859 
very good value because it really
doesn't<00:01:09.340> it's<00:01:09.670> not<00:01:09.850> as<00:01:10.030> if<00:01:10.180> this<00:01:10.330> thing<00:01:10.390> is<00:01:10.840> a

00:01:10.859 --> 00:01:10.869 
doesn't it's not as if this thing is a

sites that have free movies and things

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:33.719 
sites that have free movies and things

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:33.729 
and so it's it's not exactly what a lot

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:35.450 
and so it's it's not exactly what a lot
of<00:01:33.850> people<00:01:34.030> expect<00:01:34.600> when<00:01:34.750> they<00:01:34.899> get<00:01:35.140> it

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
of people expect when they get it

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.919 
of people expect when they get it
personally<00:01:36.460> it<00:01:36.759> didn't<00:01:37.090> matter<00:01:37.270> that<00:01:37.390> much<00:01:37.720> to

00:01:37.919 --> 00:01:37.929 
personally it didn't matter that much to

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:40.410 
personally it didn't matter that much to
me<00:01:38.080> because<00:01:38.500> it<00:01:38.679> did<00:01:38.860> organize<00:01:39.190> the<00:01:39.970> shows<00:01:40.210> I
