00:00:00.029 --> 00:00:04.860
 we should do another or super the tutorial cult like how to get to know the 

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:07.880
 Different tools of the 3d studio max 

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:09.879
 let's continue with what we are doing 

00:00:09.879 --> 00:00:13.659
 as safa on go as we have done before we go to opel 

00:00:14.999 --> 00:00:16.410
 we are going to select 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.410
 where we have the folder 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:26.189
 and we want April 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.079
 this area is spent in that I had not created before I was the bald or 

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:33.750
 you can do it, you can see that it is the one that has made a 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.469
 Indian put four nonsense out there is just for you to see and for 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.220
 move forward a little 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:43.150
 well in this case we're going to learn how to do is groups and how they change the 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:46.870
 name of the different things that can be very useful when it comes to 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:50.130
 make a scene with many things like like this 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:53.050
 because for example if the famous selection by name 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:56.770
 as you see here we have waits that the fer advocated for a hundred we would not return 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:58.050
 crazy not 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.250
 but bianchi for example we want to calf this ball 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:02.639
 is waiting 

00:01:02.639 --> 00:01:03.900
 standby team 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:07.080
 we put you I know percent 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:12.520
 what panama 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.530
 we were not able to understand and we have already changed the name to the ball 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.130
 so what would happen if the astana were to be selected with many 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:21.740
 objects 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.960
 that particular ball that we already know what the name is 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.620
 as you see, you have to put the shock 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:30.040
 3 say goodbye select 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:33.180
 the ball will automatically select it 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:37.490
 ok now yes for example airport flight attendants 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:41.260
 There are several ways of doing what would be a group 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:42.570
 can for example 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.480
 we can drag to 

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:47.610
 with the left button on 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.610
 everything we want to vote 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:54.810
 that as it is so you can select all this 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.750
 oboes to the group to the group 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:57.850
 text of what 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:00.290
 you put group 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:04.600
 and he puts his group name for his I do not know percent 

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:10.099
 It was what I 

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:14.000
 and you already read what you see the group as if now for example selection 

00:02:13.999 --> 00:02:16.759
 it's something else and select this as grouped hotels 

00:02:16.759 --> 00:02:20.189
 it bothered him at the same time that it is also useful voice for what we want to do 

00:02:20.189 --> 00:02:21.839
 for whatever 

00:02:21.839 --> 00:02:24.849
 see something else let's go to the group 

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:27.339
 let's pao open 

00:02:27.339 --> 00:02:31.539
 selected what you want to separate from the group select this by 

00:02:31.539 --> 00:02:32.429
 example 

00:02:32.429 --> 00:02:35.539
 wolves to cÃ¡diz japan is the same 

00:02:35.539 --> 00:02:37.469
 good again to the euro 

00:02:37.469 --> 00:02:39.119
 and by slaves 

00:02:39.119 --> 00:02:41.979
 fox well and as you see 

00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:43.309
 we can move 

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:47.499
 this as we give the real win i is still grouped 

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:49.999
 we take a step back 

00:02:49.999 --> 00:02:51.719
 they went down forum was 

00:02:51.719 --> 00:02:56.729
 you can see if you want it with a group in fact if you have grouped 

00:02:56.729 --> 00:02:59.629
 we are going to use the same modified we have used the 

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:02.629
 but other authorities are going to have 

00:03:04.289 --> 00:03:06.929
 let's give him tekis 

00:03:06.929 --> 00:03:10.839
 and we are going to give him who some poems e of 180 for example if you fall 

00:03:11.789 --> 00:03:13.050
 i face 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:15.589
 because this is not what I should 

00:03:15.589 --> 00:03:16.909
 in this way 

00:03:16.909 --> 00:03:20.359
 in that group we will do the same goes and will be modified 

00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:23.359
 I opened the pear list 

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:26.509
 at 

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:28.409
 selection is everything 

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:31.089
 that group goes 

00:03:31.089 --> 00:03:35.119
 and the forages that decision the shit that did not keep the group open 

00:03:36.039 --> 00:03:37.319
 with the group closed 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:39.329
 baeza modify 

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:42.329
 look for that music see 

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:47.609
 selected per cent example do this what is 150 

00:03:49.719 --> 00:03:51.319
 ten times 

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:52.209
 what 

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:56.909
 He has made us and walk because they are so rare that I do not serve for what was found 

00:03:56.909 --> 00:03:59.559
 that we will follow 12 hours of work example the mountain 

00:03:59.559 --> 00:04:03.259
 with trees and we have now as gerard to hueber the trees on a 

00:04:03.259 --> 00:04:04.089
 flat 

00:04:04.089 --> 00:04:07.219
 we can make this modification for example 

00:04:07.219 --> 00:04:09.729
 Come on, it's a previous art 

00:04:09.729 --> 00:04:13.059
 comes in several ways to make the bosch group nothing 

00:04:13.059 --> 00:04:17.329
 due for 6 out of 100 a rough one for example tablecloth ejected control climate and 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:21.409
 selecting the different parts of the ones that you say grouping 

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:23.009
 in the same group 

00:04:23.009 --> 00:04:26.039
 nothing of him with everything selected good insurance 

00:04:26.039 --> 00:04:28.279
 barely to group 

00:04:28.279 --> 00:04:33.719
 i group them and wash and if you see teams you see that all the names we had 

00:04:33.719 --> 00:04:34.610
 before 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:38.680
 They are going to be shortened by the time of the dance by selecting the 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:40.770
 different parts 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:41.610
 Tehran 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:43.009
 this is another 

00:04:43.009 --> 00:04:45.449
 I could tutor minister and mosquera followed 

00:04:45.449 --> 00:04:47.450
 proven are those that go through there 

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:49.759
 to learn how this works 

00:04:49.759 --> 00:04:50.610
 to another
