 we arrived at the dragon alexander stop 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.420
 off fascinates the cave form of the 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:14.700
 station the granite that makes up the 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:17.190
 metro Stockholm is lined with 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:20.670
 cement and gives the visitor the feeling 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:22.680
 to be inside a grotto the 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.720
 caverns are mainly found in 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:27.780
 the blue line and they were built in the 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:30.420
 70's for the young the ideal moment 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.970
 to capture the perfect photo is when 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:35.340
 the stations are deserted on 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:39.950
 all in the night 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.950
 still have to have patience 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:51.400
 this posture hurts but after a 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:53.140
 while I get up and walk a little what 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.770
 The only thing I have to do is press the 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:57.470
 trigger 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:03:01.630
 in the image is already ready you just have to 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:01.630
 wait for the moment and now 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:08.460
 most stockholm stations 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:11.190
 They house sculptures paintings and 

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:13.080
 art installations the service of 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:15.810
 transport qualifies the metro as the 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:17.850
 Largest art gallery in the world 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:20.340
 alexander dragon of integrates the works of 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:23.280
 art in his photographs although only 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:25.440
 as a secondary element in your work 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:28.020
 explores the symmetries and dynamics of 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:29.940
 the lines in just one year 

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:33.410
 his photographs stopped being simple 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:33.410
 amateur attempts 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:40.390
 The best ones are compiled in 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:43.500
 The tunnel catalog is vain and they reflect 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:43.500
 your persistent search 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:54.010
 the learning process was quite 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:58.629
 arduo provides many cameras and objectives 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:04:01.060
 different in the end come to the 

00:03:58.629 --> 00:04:03.879
 conclusion that he should use a 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:06.790
 wide-angle lens to get the 

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:08.950
 photographs that I wanted 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:12.120
 bolt 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:14.590
 and this is the last stop of the night 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:17.560
 alexander dragon of not making money with 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:19.750
 his photos but that does not bother him 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:21.730
 images of the Stockholm metro appear 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:24.490
 on the internet in the first places of 

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:28.169
 a search that is already a reason for 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:28.169
 enough pride for him 

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:34.479
 these wonderful places are 

00:04:32.379 --> 00:04:37.210
 they find hiding down here and now 

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:39.159
 many people know them and when 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:41.770
 visit in Stockholm in addition to visiting 

00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:44.069
 streets and museums stroll through their world 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:44.069
 Underground 

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:49.180
 alexander dragon of ya finished his 

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:51.940
 photo project in the metro 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:54.730
 Stockholm now wants to photograph other 

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:57.010
 Munich and London stations are your 

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:58.870
 preferred destinations with their stations 

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:01.410
 of metro very different from those of 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:01.410
 Stockholm
