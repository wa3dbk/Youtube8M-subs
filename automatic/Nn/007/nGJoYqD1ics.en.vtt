00:00:10.869 --> 00:00:13.869
 also systems 

00:00:14.399 --> 00:00:17.949
 robot-assisted rehabilitation increases the efficiency of the 

00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:20.949
 rehabilitation in patients who have suffered a stroke 

00:00:26.489 --> 00:00:29.419
 the increase of people with limb impairments 

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:34.140
 higher in particular by stroke is the result of increased hope for 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.730
 life the increase in the number of elderly people and the growing 

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:40.729
 Iquitos prevalence with age 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.150
 min 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:48.970
 also if it aims to develop a low technology 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:52.510
 cost for the rehabilitation of singular urubú of the upper extremities 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:02.300
 this patented system that uses a mobile base to support and measure 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.550
 user interactions during the movements of man and elbow in the 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:09.550
 arm exercise after a stroke 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.320
 the platform is composed of the device plus cisco bush trivet 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.900
 for a smooth and precise movement on a table and software that allows the 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:26.900
 communication between devices and a computer 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:40.460
 the device is placed on the forearm of the user through a contribution if 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.460
 this summer 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:49.400
 For general positioning tasks, several modules can be used to 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:54.550
 restrict inducing or measuring the movement of the arm as for example by thesis 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:58.580
 rigid coast and cylinder heads can passive coercion for prizes 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:06.400
 also if it allows rehabilitation through games and 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:10.250
 virtual environments with quantitative measurements of the interaction of 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.649
 user 

00:02:13.649 --> 00:02:18.089
 the information is available for use in real time progress reports 

00:02:18.089 --> 00:02:22.899
 short and long term trend analysis clinical evaluations and the 

00:02:22.899 --> 00:02:25.139
 treatment planning 

00:02:25.139 --> 00:02:29.040
 there is no device on the market today for use in 

00:02:29.039 --> 00:02:32.889
 the home that is capable of providing quantitative measurements on the 

00:02:32.889 --> 00:02:35.869
 position and gropes the hand and forearm 

00:02:35.869 --> 00:02:39.649
 The system also has been developed for compatibility with 

00:02:39.649 --> 00:02:44.019
 a rehabilitation platform for louzán the clinics are home 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:47.859
 It deals with an additional differentiation with respect to existing solutions 

00:02:47.859 --> 00:02:50.269
 as well as its modularity 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:55.109
 the system will be available in the active passive versions and brakes with 

00:02:55.109 --> 00:02:58.420
 quick connect modules that support the movement of support to the 

00:02:58.419 --> 00:03:01.419
 wrist and the reach of the hand 

00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:07.099
 in combination with the platform costs training televises the system 

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:10.059
 allows a full range of brazil hand training 

00:03:10.059 --> 00:03:12.529
 supported by professionals at home
