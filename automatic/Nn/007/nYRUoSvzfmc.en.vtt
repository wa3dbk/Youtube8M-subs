00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
now even though these are oven baked

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.709 
now even though these are oven baked
ribs<00:00:46.500> you<00:00:47.190> can<00:00:47.219> still<00:00:47.550> achieve<00:00:47.670> that<00:00:48.120> smoky

ribs you can still achieve that smoky

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.650 
ribs you can still achieve that smoky
flavor<00:00:48.750> you<00:00:49.170> get<00:00:49.320> from<00:00:49.590> a<00:00:49.620> smoker<00:00:50.039> or<00:00:50.370> a<00:00:50.660> grill

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
flavor you get from a smoker or a grill

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.720 
flavor you get from a smoker or a grill
by<00:00:52.260> adding<00:00:52.589> liquid<00:00:52.890> smoke<00:00:53.160> and<00:00:53.309> smearing

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
by adding liquid smoke and smearing

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.870 
by adding liquid smoke and smearing
across<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.239> whole<00:00:54.420> top<00:00:54.449> of<00:00:54.780> the<00:00:55.019> rack<00:00:55.260> of<00:00:55.559> ribs

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:57.880 

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:00.630 

then<00:00:58.480> the<00:00:58.630> seasoning<00:00:59.110> sample<00:00:59.530> just<00:01:00.220> come<00:01:00.430> over

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:00.640 
then the seasoning sample just come over

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.390 
then the seasoning sample just come over
the<00:01:00.760> top<00:01:00.790> of<00:01:00.970> some<00:01:01.300> kosher<00:01:01.510> salt<00:01:02.070> then<00:01:03.070> hit<00:01:03.370> it

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:03.400 
the top of some kosher salt then hit it

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:06.350 
the top of some kosher salt then hit it
with<00:01:03.520> some<00:01:03.760> black<00:01:03.970> pepper

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.560 

and<00:01:07.140> then<00:01:07.350> I<00:01:07.440> like<00:01:07.680> to<00:01:07.830> shake<00:01:08.040> cumin<00:01:08.640> down<00:01:09.390> the

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
and then I like to shake cumin down the

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.090 
and then I like to shake cumin down the
whole<00:01:09.720> top<00:01:09.990> as<00:01:10.200> well

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:13.100 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.090 

then<00:01:13.880> press<00:01:14.180> the<00:01:14.210> meat<00:01:14.510> firmly<00:01:14.869> and<00:01:15.830> it<00:01:15.950> should

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:16.100 
then press the meat firmly and it should

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:21.570 
then press the meat firmly and it should
look<00:01:16.250> something<00:01:16.520> like<00:01:16.670> this

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:21.580 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:24.180 

now<00:01:22.150> all<00:01:22.330> you<00:01:22.450> got<00:01:22.600> to<00:01:22.630> do<00:01:22.870> is<00:01:23.140> throw<00:01:23.830> the<00:01:23.980> rack

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:24.190 
now all you got to do is throw the rack

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:28.090 
now all you got to do is throw the rack
into<00:01:24.490> an<00:01:24.730> oven-safe<00:01:25.030> pan

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:28.100 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.250 

and<00:01:28.430> then<00:01:28.670> cover<00:01:28.970> it<00:01:29.150> lightly<00:01:29.420> with<00:01:29.720> tinfoil

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:30.260 
and then cover it lightly with tinfoil

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.399 
and then cover it lightly with tinfoil
now<00:01:31.159> this<00:01:31.370> isn't<00:01:31.550> a<00:01:31.729> recipe<00:01:32.240> you<00:01:32.420> want<00:01:32.630> to<00:01:32.840> seal

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:33.409 
now this isn't a recipe you want to seal

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:35.290 
now this isn't a recipe you want to seal
up<00:01:33.590> completely<00:01:34.070> you<00:01:34.430> want<00:01:34.880> to<00:01:34.970> leave<00:01:35.120> it<00:01:35.240> a

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:35.300 
up completely you want to leave it a

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:36.910 
up completely you want to leave it a
little<00:01:35.420> bit<00:01:35.630> loose<00:01:35.840> on<00:01:36.050> the<00:01:36.140> side<00:01:36.380> so<00:01:36.680> it<00:01:36.800> can

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:36.920 
little bit loose on the side so it can

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.219 
little bit loose on the side so it can
let<00:01:37.070> out<00:01:37.190> some<00:01:37.370> steam<00:01:37.720> and<00:01:38.720> you<00:01:38.780> can<00:01:38.930> put<00:01:39.110> it

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:39.229 
let out some steam and you can put it

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:42.820 
let out some steam and you can put it
into<00:01:39.470> the<00:01:39.590> oven

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:42.830 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:44.920 

we're<00:01:43.520> going<00:01:43.640> to<00:01:43.700> start<00:01:43.940> baking<00:01:44.150> at<00:01:44.420> 300

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:44.930 
we're going to start baking at 300

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:46.960 
we're going to start baking at 300
degrees<00:01:45.230> for<00:01:45.650> two<00:01:45.830> and<00:01:46.010> a<00:01:46.040> half<00:01:46.070> out<00:01:46.580> of<00:01:46.790> the

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:46.970 
degrees for two and a half out of the

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:53.750 
degrees for two and a half out of the
three<00:01:47.330> hours<00:01:47.570> of<00:01:47.840> baking

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:53.760 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:56.450 

as<00:01:53.820> you<00:01:54.480> can<00:01:54.630> see<00:01:54.870> there's<00:01:55.320> 30<00:01:56.040> minutes<00:01:56.250> left

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
as you can see there's 30 minutes left

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.400 
as you can see there's 30 minutes left
on<00:01:56.760> the<00:01:56.850> clock<00:01:57.090> and<00:01:57.450> we're<00:01:58.020> going<00:01:58.170> to<00:01:58.230> bump

00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:58.410 
on the clock and we're going to bump

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:03.470 
on the clock and we're going to bump
this<00:01:58.680> temperature<00:01:59.220> all<00:01:59.370> the<00:01:59.490> way<00:01:59.610> up<00:01:59.730> to<00:01:59.930> 350

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:03.480 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:07.270 

then<00:02:04.050> we're<00:02:04.230> going<00:02:04.320> to<00:02:04.380> pull<00:02:04.710> the<00:02:05.040> tinfoil<00:02:05.520> off

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 
then we're going to pull the tinfoil off

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.100 
then we're going to pull the tinfoil off
put<00:02:08.280> it<00:02:08.370> back<00:02:08.580> in<00:02:08.850> for<00:02:09.090> the<00:02:09.360> remaining<00:02:09.720> 30

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
put it back in for the remaining 30

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.780 
put it back in for the remaining 30
minutes<00:02:12.410> and<00:02:13.410> when<00:02:13.620> you're<00:02:13.770> done<00:02:13.980> should<00:02:14.610> look

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
minutes and when you're done should look

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:23.430 
minutes and when you're done should look
something<00:02:15.180> like<00:02:15.210> this

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.830 

and<00:02:23.530> I<00:02:24.250> would<00:02:24.430> highly<00:02:24.910> recommend<00:02:24.940> using<00:02:25.660> a

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
and I would highly recommend using a

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.230 
and I would highly recommend using a
spatula<00:02:26.140> or<00:02:26.740> something<00:02:27.220> that<00:02:27.340> you<00:02:27.550> can<00:02:27.760> use<00:02:28.030> to

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:28.240 
spatula or something that you can use to

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:30.210 
spatula or something that you can use to
transport<00:02:28.870> it<00:02:28.990> so<00:02:29.170> it<00:02:29.290> doesn't<00:02:29.680> fall<00:02:29.860> apart

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
transport it so it doesn't fall apart

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:35.490 
transport it so it doesn't fall apart
because<00:02:30.550> it<00:02:31.030> is<00:02:31.240> that<00:02:31.600> tender<00:02:34.050> but<00:02:35.050> first<00:02:35.320> I

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
because it is that tender but first I

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.730 
because it is that tender but first I
