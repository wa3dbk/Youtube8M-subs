together like that okay and then what

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:17.390 
together like that okay and then what
I'm<00:04:16.290> going<00:04:16.470> to<00:04:16.500> do<00:04:16.680> is<00:04:16.770> I'm<00:04:16.890> going<00:04:16.950> to<00:04:17.070> sling

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400 
I'm going to do is I'm going to sling

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:20.479 
I'm going to do is I'm going to sling
down<00:04:18.200> this<00:04:19.200> corner<00:04:19.799> because<00:04:19.950> it's<00:04:20.220> very<00:04:20.340> short

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
down this corner because it's very short

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:24.020 
down this corner because it's very short
so<00:04:21.060> the<00:04:21.150> fur<00:04:21.330> can<00:04:21.600> sit<00:04:21.870> on<00:04:21.900> it<00:04:22.200> it's<00:04:23.190> not<00:04:23.280> really

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:24.030 
so the fur can sit on it it's not really

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:25.190 
so the fur can sit on it it's not really
comfortable

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:25.200 
comfortable

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:27.500 
comfortable

going<00:05:23.670> to<00:05:23.850> put<00:05:24.000> it<00:05:24.090> up<00:05:24.240> here<00:05:24.270> but<00:05:25.170> what<00:05:25.290> I<00:05:25.320> did

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:25.560 
going to put it up here but what I did

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:27.970 
going to put it up here but what I did
is<00:05:25.680> I<00:05:25.830> put<00:05:26.100> a<00:05:26.130> couple<00:05:26.520> of<00:05:26.580> pieces<00:05:26.850> of<00:05:27.030> wood<00:05:27.540> on

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:27.980 
is I put a couple of pieces of wood on

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:31.400 
is I put a couple of pieces of wood on
one<00:05:28.980> here<00:05:29.400> they<00:05:30.360> don't<00:05:30.420> they<00:05:30.960> don't<00:05:30.990> have<00:05:31.260> to

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:31.410 
one here they don't they don't have to

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:35.930 
one here they don't they don't have to
be<00:05:31.530> big<00:05:31.710> I<00:05:31.830> left<00:05:32.070> this<00:05:32.520> wood<00:05:33.320> over<00:05:34.320> my<00:05:34.500> wall<00:05:34.940> so

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:38.300 
be big I left this wood over my wall so
the<00:05:36.000> obvious<00:05:36.170> there<00:05:37.170> will<00:05:37.470> be<00:05:37.500> a<00:05:37.650> separation

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:38.310 
the obvious there will be a separation

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:41.300 
the obvious there will be a separation
between<00:05:38.670> the<00:05:39.290> purchase<00:05:40.290> and<00:05:40.470> the<00:05:40.710> wall<00:05:40.890> so

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:41.310 
between the purchase and the wall so

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:42.980 
between the purchase and the wall so
when<00:05:41.490> I<00:05:41.580> clean<00:05:41.880> it<00:05:42.030> little<00:05:42.330> drips<00:05:42.570> all<00:05:42.750> the<00:05:42.870> way

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:42.990 
when I clean it little drips all the way

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:46.250 
when I clean it little drips all the way
to<00:05:43.050> the<00:05:43.260> floor<00:05:43.500> and<00:05:44.040> I<00:05:44.130> can<00:05:44.840> scrape<00:05:45.840> the<00:05:45.990> floor

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:46.260 
to the floor and I can scrape the floor

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:50.510 
to the floor and I can scrape the floor
and<00:05:48.140> our<00:05:49.140> standard<00:05:49.680> measurement<00:05:50.160> is<00:05:50.280> five

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:50.520 
and our standard measurement is five

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:52.970 
and our standard measurement is five
feet<00:05:50.760> divided<00:05:51.210> into<00:05:51.450> five<00:05:51.690> okay<00:05:52.560> that's<00:05:52.830> a

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:52.980 
feet divided into five okay that's a

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:56.720 
feet divided into five okay that's a
easy<00:05:53.340> way<00:05:53.550> to<00:05:53.580> do<00:05:54.240> it<00:05:54.270> I<00:05:54.570> get<00:05:54.840> to<00:05:54.870> figure<00:05:55.440> out<00:05:55.730> so

00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:56.730 
easy way to do it I get to figure out so

00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:59.870 
easy way to do it I get to figure out so
I'm<00:05:56.940> just<00:05:56.970> going<00:05:57.270> to<00:05:57.360> hang<00:05:57.690> it<00:05:57.900> up<00:05:57.930> here<00:05:58.880> and

00:05:59.870 --> 00:05:59.880 
I'm just going to hang it up here and

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:08.489 
I'm just going to hang it up here and
show<00:06:00.480> you<00:06:00.540> how<00:06:00.840> easy<00:06:01.050> is<00:06:01.230> to<00:06:01.260> set<00:06:01.920> this<00:06:02.100> up<00:06:02.960> okay

00:06:08.489 --> 00:06:08.499 

00:06:08.499 --> 00:06:11.889 

so<00:06:09.499> now<00:06:09.619> we're<00:06:09.800> going<00:06:09.919> to<00:06:10.039> nail<00:06:10.520> it<00:06:10.550> to<00:06:10.969> through

00:06:11.889 --> 00:06:11.899 
so now we're going to nail it to through

00:06:11.899 --> 00:06:13.570 
so now we're going to nail it to through
the<00:06:11.990> wall<00:06:12.199> sort<00:06:12.469> of<00:06:12.589> way<00:06:12.680> won't<00:06:12.919> come<00:06:13.129> off

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:13.580 
the wall sort of way won't come off

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:17.589 
the wall sort of way won't come off
but<00:06:13.999> we<00:06:14.149> got<00:06:14.330> our<00:06:14.569> space<00:06:15.849> we've<00:06:16.849> got<00:06:16.969> a<00:06:16.999> spacing

00:06:17.589 --> 00:06:17.599 
but we got our space we've got a spacing

00:06:17.599 --> 00:06:20.499 
but we got our space we've got a spacing
in<00:06:18.050> between<00:06:18.080> the<00:06:18.559> wall<00:06:18.770> that<00:06:19.610> our<00:06:19.759> way<00:06:19.909> is<00:06:20.089> easy

00:06:20.499 --> 00:06:20.509 
in between the wall that our way is easy

00:06:20.509 --> 00:06:23.799 
in between the wall that our way is easy
to<00:06:20.749> on<00:06:21.309> to<00:06:22.309> clean<00:06:22.580> up<00:06:22.789> okay

00:07:12.589 --> 00:07:15.249 
think that's coming out coming off but
uh<00:07:12.620> that's<00:07:13.399> how<00:07:13.519> you<00:07:13.580> this<00:07:14.569> is<00:07:14.779> the<00:07:14.899> furture

00:07:15.249 --> 00:07:15.259 
uh that's how you this is the furture

00:07:15.259 --> 00:07:18.100 
uh that's how you this is the furture
that<00:07:15.469> we<00:07:15.589> use<00:07:15.949> on<00:07:16.249> them<00:07:16.580> often<00:07:17.059> but<00:07:17.779> this<00:07:17.959> is

00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:18.110 
that we use on them often but this is

00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:22.449 
that we use on them often but this is
going<00:07:18.289> to<00:07:18.349> be<00:07:18.439> for<00:07:18.620> the<00:07:18.709> rice<00:07:18.949> team<00:07:19.370> so<00:07:20.149> I<00:07:21.459> did

00:07:22.449 --> 00:07:22.459 
going to be for the rice team so I did

00:07:22.459 --> 00:07:23.980 
going to be for the rice team so I did
it<00:07:22.550> this<00:07:22.699> way<00:07:22.939> because<00:07:23.180> they<00:07:23.509> don't<00:07:23.749> have<00:07:23.809> to

00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:23.990
