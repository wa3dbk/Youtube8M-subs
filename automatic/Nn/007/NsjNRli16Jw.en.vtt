00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.130
 hello friends from youtube I'm me Jorge and I've 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.930
 returned on behalf of beast 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.120
 sea and as you can see on this occasion 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.370
 disguised as galactus to bring them a 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.889
 top 5 video of the best enemies of 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.660
 the marvel comic series before they say 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.490
 something should clarify a couple of things 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.260
 first everything is at our discretion what 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.210
 which does not mean it like that and 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.310
 second this top is not what is the 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.830
 most powerful villain but the worst good 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.930
 with this has clarified here goes well before 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.849
 I will tell you that we had a 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.830
 small discussion and we thought it would be 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.530
 we just told them the why not 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:37.110
 the first of them entered the ranking 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.820
 these three the green elf he could 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.710
 enter this ranking for being the 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.690
 perfect antithesis of spiderman 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.879
 acts and speaks like him but with a 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.590
 evil thought is so bad that it does not 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:49.110
 he cares about liquidating his own son 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.239
 use it as an experiment the reason why 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.949
 that is discarded is because his 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.050
 dementia sometimes does not allow 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.329
 react well besides him in some 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.340
 cases it ends up doing good but what 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.469
 main he is norm we gordi him and his 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.940
 son or be a villain played by 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.610
 two people 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.320
 the second victor of this type is bad 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.210
 like the shit ha ha ha ha do not see in 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.520
 serious this guy is bad and so much that 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.830
 although it originally emerged as an enemy 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.409
 of the 'fantastic four' could be made 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.869
 enemy of hulk wolverine spiderman and 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.640
 all the avengers that son in the end 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.290
 guy is a headache for the 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.330
 good but the reason why not 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.490
 appears is that despite being bad not 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:29.580
 he manages to win never besides he dreams of 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:32.190
 dominate the world and the third is the 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:34.289
 throne this machine without feelings knows 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:36.270
 how to fuck the avengers but has 

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:37.950
 the same drama that dunn and besides I already know 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.990
 I said that force does not have to do 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.440
 but the one in position 5 would beat him 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.440
 problems 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:52.060
 magnetto the main villain of the 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:54.310
 x-men although he knew how to be an enemy of 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.350
 spiderman the fantastic four and the 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:58.780
 Avengers being one of the villains 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:00.610
 most feared thanks to his power which 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:03.009
 gives you control over the metal and creates 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:04.930
 magnetic fields this power makes 

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:06.790
 men fear him for the simple fact 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:08.830
 that everything is now done 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:10.869
 of metal in short the guy could 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:13.330
 kill you with whatever you want even with your 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:15.610
 own cell phone ha ha ha ha but the worst 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.709
 is that he uses his intelligence and his 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:19.420
 ease for speech cheating 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:21.489
 other mutants to fulfill their 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:23.680
 sinister purposes which according to him 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:25.540
 is to destroy homo sapiens which does not 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.640
 it's all the truth because its true 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:30.340
 Desire is revenge and dominate the world 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:32.050
 the reason why it does not rise is that 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.330
 the manipulator is bad but at times 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:38.160
 someone becomes good especially with 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:38.160
 his archenemy professor javier 

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:46.460
 carnage originally an enemy of 

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:48.980
 spiderman belongs to the group of villains 

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:50.750
 symbiotic are people who maintain 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:52.340
 a relationship with a felt that he 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.710
 Feeds on the emotions of your 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.740
 host in exchange this one receives power a 

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:59.600
 great strength and particular skills 

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:01.640
 in his carnal case he is the son of venom 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:03.710
 he has spiderman power like his father 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:05.660
 but unlike him he is capable of 

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:07.850
 throw your kind of spider web by any 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:09.890
 part of your body and not exactly 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:11.960
 a cobweb but a kind of blood 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:13.850
 unlike his father is not due to 

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:15.890
 high temperatures and if you separate the 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:18.290
 simian host test that regenerates 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:20.000
 through blood the reason for the 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:22.070
 that he is here is because before 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.050
 get your symbiote the host was 

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:25.820
 captured by spiderman after having 

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:27.590
 murdered many people and everything 

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:29.450
 gets worse when he joins his Indians 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:31.490
 killing all the guards of the 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:33.380
 prison his desire is to murder 

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:36.350
 around the world and in such a way that it kills 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:38.210
 his own father but he does not advance because of 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:40.400
 his madness sometimes does not allow him to think 

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:42.350
 correctly and commit stupidities 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:45.520
 thanks to his own madness is that it was 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:45.520
 expired several times 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:54.800
 dance or face cough one of the most villains 

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:56.870
 powerful marvel if I have to be 

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:58.910
 honest of this guy we do not have much 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:01.100
 information what happens is that although a 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:03.170
 many what about 7 what I'm going to say was not 

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:06.200
 very televised this subject except in the 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:08.300
 present with the avengers well this 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:10.670
 guy is enemy of not going captain marvel 

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:12.860
 and of greater space the great majority 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:14.870
 of its power lies in its infinite glove 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:17.600
 which for me to put it in the q 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:20.480
 well this glove gives you control over the 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:22.490
 space of time the reason that is 

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:24.740
 here is simple do not dream of killing or 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:27.860
 dominate the world this guy conforms 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:29.419
 with the giant universe but it does not advance 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:31.220
 because like others who have 

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:33.440
 various heroes is defeated several 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:35.750
 sometimes its power is based on its 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:37.820
 glove if this one would not be so powerful he 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:39.380
 He is very obsessive with that glove and 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:41.570
 last the next post 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:43.660
 apparently causes a certain fear in 

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:43.660
 the 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:52.420
 galactus as you will have realized is 

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:55.990
 my favorite in the marvel world and that's why 

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:57.760
 I dressed up hahaha good seriously he is 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:59.770
 an almighty being who maintains a 

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:03.340
 immense power which can only exist 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:05.050
 after choking on planets this guy 

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:07.330
 he was first enemy of the four 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:09.700
 fantastic but in his life he faced 

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:12.100
 many heroes thor hulk and batman the 

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:14.020
 avenger ghost silver surfer 'and up 

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:16.090
 villains like dun tanos and even a 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:18.460
 fucking planet that had a life of its own 

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:20.290
 and he lived it fucking him he's also the 

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:22.330
 fear of tanos and the reason why 

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:24.250
 he needs the glove to defeat him 

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:26.290
 and he does it but only because he had the 

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:30.280
 glove otherwise I would not achieve anything 

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:32.290
 he he he he he he he je the reason for this 

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:34.150
 since he is almost never defeated and 

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:36.430
 to do it you need a huge 

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:38.320
 power or meeting of many heroes besides 

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:40.150
 recognize what is more scary than you 

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:42.670
 say come the emperor tanos or come 

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:44.740
 galactus the devourer of worlds besides 

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:47.290
 Galactus is accused of devouring the world 

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:51.030
 scroll and it just does not advance because the 

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:51.030
 next is better enemy than him 

00:05:57.390 --> 00:06:03.240
 but before they say they listen to what 

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:05.490
 that I have to say venom is an enemy of 

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:08.340
 spiderman and it's like carnage a simbionte 

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:10.260
 it's really his father this guy is 

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:12.660
 result of the union of the ape that 

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:15.300
 joined with spiderman and the ibrox although today 

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:17.460
 is another the true is the good the 

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:19.650
 why this and big ball we 

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:22.410
 galactus and even carnage are stronger 

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:24.810
 I tell them not to be all is not over 

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:27.840
 strong but the worst villain because it would be 

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:30.210
 the but well see it so this guy is 

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:32.700
 as spiderman only that 10 times more 

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:34.890
 strong fast and resistant its cobweb 

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:36.930
 it was more powerful and to top it all the way 

00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:39.420
 spiderman arachnid does not work with him 

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:41.550
 but something even worse he knows absolutely 

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:43.680
 everything close to spiderman his identity 

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:45.570
 where and with whom you live and who are your 

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:47.490
 friends and to make his dream worse 

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:49.650
 destroy it and make it suffer a lot 

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:52.080
 humiliating him forcing him to show his 

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:53.850
 identity before your friends and many will say 

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:55.920
 but karma also knows that the 

00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:58.110
 difference is that venom does not know of hand 

00:06:55.920 --> 00:07:00.660
 own because his felt was spiderman 

00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:02.220
 that's why he is the most fearsome villain that 

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:03.800
 worse than a guy who knows absolutely 

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:06.440
 all 

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:11.409
 what you have to say about this is no longer 

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:11.409
 more to follow and not more simple just 

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:28.630
 you can not understand 

00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:35.190
 one 

00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:38.070
 maybe they do not pay but I do 

00:07:35.190 --> 00:07:40.680
 I did it before and believe me I will not do it again 

00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:42.330
 we remember them is all we could 

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:45.449
 think while we were traveling the 

00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:47.289
 outer space 

00:07:45.449 --> 00:07:49.129
 why 

00:07:47.289 --> 00:07:51.139
 wrong 

00:07:49.129 --> 00:07:53.539
 it has strengthened mothers of the last 

00:07:51.139 --> 00:07:56.629
 time if that is possible 

00:07:53.539 --> 00:07:59.419
 there will be no noise to help you this time 

00:07:56.629 --> 00:08:01.610
 it will be different from the last time either 

00:07:59.419 --> 00:08:03.529
 friends, I hope you liked it, leave 

00:08:01.610 --> 00:08:05.749
 good comments and if you liked 

00:08:03.529 --> 00:08:07.550
 we could do some more leave 

00:08:05.749 --> 00:08:10.009
 some comments from those who think 

00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:12.550
 that should have appeared good until 

00:08:10.009 --> 00:08:12.550
 the next
