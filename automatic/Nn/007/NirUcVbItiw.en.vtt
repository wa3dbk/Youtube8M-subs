two-thirty and I initially thought

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.229 
two-thirty and I initially thought
retail<00:00:31.830> was<00:00:31.980> 175<00:00:33.140> but<00:00:34.140> I<00:00:34.170> was<00:00:34.410> like<00:00:34.559> I<00:00:35.239> really

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
retail was 175 but I was like I really

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:37.790 
retail was 175 but I was like I really
want<00:00:36.450> them<00:00:36.660> and<00:00:36.840> as<00:00:36.930> I<00:00:37.020> until<00:00:37.200> two-thirty<00:00:37.530> was

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
want them and as I until two-thirty was

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.860 
want them and as I until two-thirty was
kind<00:00:37.950> of<00:00:38.010> a<00:00:38.100> lot<00:00:38.340> but<00:00:38.940> then<00:00:39.059> I<00:00:39.090> heard<00:00:39.270> retail<00:00:39.719> is

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
kind of a lot but then I heard retail is

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.380 
kind of a lot but then I heard retail is
really<00:00:40.440> 150<00:00:41.100> and<00:00:41.579> that<00:00:41.700> definitely<00:00:42.090> wasn't

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
really 150 and that definitely wasn't

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.630 
really 150 and that definitely wasn't
paying<00:00:42.690> no<00:00:42.809> 234<00:00:43.590> him<00:00:43.710> so<00:00:43.980> I<00:00:44.010> definitely<00:00:44.250> passed
