00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
at the end of 2010 so last year was our

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.560 
at the end of 2010 so last year was our
first<00:00:54.539> full<00:00:55.020> year<00:00:55.670> with<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:56.789> full<00:00:57.000> lineup<00:00:57.270> of

smartphones<00:00:58.109> and<00:00:58.289> so<00:00:58.469> i<00:00:58.710> think<00:00:58.980> it<00:00:59.430> was<00:00:59.579> just

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
smartphones and so i think it was just

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.930 
smartphones and so i think it was just
challenging<00:01:00.570> trying<00:01:00.899> to<00:01:01.260> meet<00:01:02.039> the<00:01:02.250> needs<00:01:02.280> of

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
challenging trying to meet the needs of

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.509 
challenging trying to meet the needs of
all<00:01:03.210> these<00:01:03.629> diff<00:01:03.870> new<00:01:04.140> products<00:01:04.890> at<00:01:05.189> the<00:01:05.339> same

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
all these diff new products at the same

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.929 
all these diff new products at the same
time<00:01:05.790> i<00:01:06.090> think<00:01:06.930> we<00:01:07.290> are<00:01:07.560> getting<00:01:08.400> there<00:01:08.700> I

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
time i think we are getting there I

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.929 
time i think we are getting there I
think<00:01:09.689> it<00:01:10.290> also<00:01:10.530> we<00:01:10.860> also<00:01:10.979> had<00:01:11.250> a<00:01:11.280> challenge<00:01:11.760> of

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
think it also we also had a challenge of

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.350

and again just took a little bit of time
to<00:01:51.750> get<00:01:52.530> up<00:01:52.560> to<00:01:52.799> speed<00:01:53.060> but<00:01:54.060> I<00:01:54.869> think<00:01:55.259> we<00:01:55.350> will

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
to get up to speed but I think we will

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.490

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
little bit of communication because it

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.319 
little bit of communication because it
looks<00:02:00.450> like<00:02:00.719> that<00:02:01.079> in<00:02:01.409> some<00:02:02.009> countries<00:02:02.329> LG

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
looks like that in some countries LG

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.060 
looks like that in some countries LG
doesn't<00:02:03.750> like<00:02:03.930> to<00:02:04.170> communicate<00:02:04.409> about<00:02:04.860> the

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
doesn't like to communicate about the

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.370 
doesn't like to communicate about the
slow<00:02:05.310> upgrades<00:02:05.820> but<00:02:06.659> do<00:02:06.869> you<00:02:06.990> think<00:02:07.049> that

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
slow upgrades but do you think that

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.499 
slow upgrades but do you think that
would<00:02:07.619> be<00:02:07.710> the<00:02:07.740> best<00:02:08.280> to<00:02:08.520> communicate<00:02:08.700> to<00:02:09.360> the

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509

countries what different language but
with<00:02:40.470> mobile<00:02:40.800> phones<00:02:40.830> that's<00:02:41.310> not<00:02:41.490> the<00:02:41.610> case

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.820 
with mobile phones that's not the case

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:43.940 
with mobile phones that's not the case
we<00:02:42.120> do<00:02:42.300> not<00:02:42.480> have<00:02:42.660> one<00:02:42.960> phone<00:02:43.200> for<00:02:43.440> every

country<00:02:44.340> there<00:02:44.490> are<00:02:44.520> certain<00:02:44.910> differences

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:45.770 
country there are certain differences

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:48.230

names<00:02:46.770> may<00:02:47.040> be<00:02:47.070> different<00:02:47.640> specs<00:02:47.970> may<00:02:48.180> be

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:48.240 
names may be different specs may be

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:51.140 
names may be different specs may be
different<00:02:48.840> so<00:02:49.140> I<00:02:49.380> think<00:02:50.010> we<00:02:50.100> have<00:02:50.280> to<00:02:50.550> we<00:02:51.120> have

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
different so I think we have to we have

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.980 
different so I think we have to we have
to<00:02:51.330> be<00:02:51.950> sensitive<00:02:52.950> to<00:02:53.340> the<00:02:53.670> fact<00:02:53.910> that<00:02:54.240> what<00:02:54.720> we

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:54.990 
to be sensitive to the fact that what we

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:58.730 
to be sensitive to the fact that what we
communicate<00:02:55.740> in<00:02:55.920> one<00:02:56.130> place<00:02:56.460> will<00:02:57.360> be<00:02:57.740> heard

00:02:58.730 --> 00:02:58.740 
communicate in one place will be heard

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:00.950 
communicate in one place will be heard
or<00:02:59.040> read<00:02:59.400> by<00:02:59.790> people<00:02:59.850> everywhere<00:03:00.750> in<00:03:00.870> the

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:00.960 
or read by people everywhere in the

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:03.410 
or read by people everywhere in the
world<00:03:00.990> and<00:03:01.440> so<00:03:02.130> we<00:03:02.550> were<00:03:02.790> probably<00:03:03.060> a<00:03:03.270> little

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
world and so we were probably a little

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:07.280 
world and so we were probably a little
bit<00:03:03.630> too<00:03:03.870> cautious<00:03:04.590> about<00:03:05.550> not<00:03:06.450> making<00:03:07.080> a

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
bit too cautious about not making a

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:10.520 
bit too cautious about not making a
mistake<00:03:07.440> but<00:03:08.430> I<00:03:08.490> think<00:03:08.850> we<00:03:09.000> will<00:03:09.210> need<00:03:09.570> to<00:03:10.020> look

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
mistake but I think we will need to look

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:14.000 
mistake but I think we will need to look
at<00:03:10.650> that<00:03:10.800> again<00:03:11.100> and<00:03:11.430> see<00:03:12.150> how<00:03:12.660> much<00:03:12.960> a<00:03:13.380> more

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
at that again and see how much a more

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.490 
at that again and see how much a more
transparent<00:03:14.340> we<00:03:14.940> can<00:03:15.180> be<00:03:15.360> without<00:03:15.900> causing

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
transparent we can be without causing

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.800 
transparent we can be without causing
more<00:03:16.650> confusion<00:03:16.830> I<00:03:17.430> think<00:03:18.060> I'd<00:03:18.390> like<00:03:18.540> to<00:03:18.600> do

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
more confusion I think I'd like to do

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:21.920 
more confusion I think I'd like to do

for again country language phone and so

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:12.940 
for again country language phone and so
there<00:04:11.160> still<00:04:11.400> is<00:04:11.760> a<00:04:11.820> couple<00:04:12.480> of<00:04:12.540> months

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:12.950 
there still is a couple of months

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:17.060 
there still is a couple of months
preparation<00:04:13.950> that<00:04:13.980> goes<00:04:14.160> into<00:04:15.650> an<00:04:16.650> upgrade

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070 
preparation that goes into an upgrade

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:18.890 
preparation that goes into an upgrade
before<00:04:17.400> it<00:04:17.640> can<00:04:17.880> go<00:04:18.060> out<00:04:18.209> to<00:04:18.359> the<00:04:18.420> consumers

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:18.900 
before it can go out to the consumers

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:21.850 
before it can go out to the consumers
now<00:04:19.080> we<00:04:19.650> of<00:04:19.859> course<00:04:19.890> want<00:04:20.520> the<00:04:20.730> best<00:04:20.970> quality
