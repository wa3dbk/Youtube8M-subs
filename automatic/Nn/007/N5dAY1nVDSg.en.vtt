00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:14.459
 in principle they do not have the diopter 

00:00:11.579 --> 00:00:16.430
 to increase or that vary during the 

00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:20.610
 pregnancy or childbirth although occasionally 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:22.530
 happen this is quite more frequent in 

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:25.770
 people women who have defects 

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:28.640
 high refractives and that tend to be 

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:28.640
 unstable 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:36.740
 some people are retouching 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:39.250
 because what the surgeon does during 

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:42.410
 A laser surgery treatment is 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:44.330
 evaporate tissue from the front 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:47.239
 of the eye of our first natural lens 

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:50.890
 that we call the cornea doing 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:52.989
 incite a laser light on it 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:54.850
 the reaction of tissues to 

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:57.970
 radiation is not for all 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:59.860
 people the same as if 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:02.410
 two people go to the beach and lie down 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:05.199
 in the sun with the same sun one will burn 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:08.440
 before the other one may a person 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:10.960
 have less sensitivity than another to the 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:13.360
 radiation that the laser emits and that 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:16.869
 do something less than effective those are the 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:19.659
 cases in which the ophthalmologist performs 

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:22.030
 a refinement of the original treatment 

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:25.890
 to correct possible defects 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:25.890
 refractives that have remained residual 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:36.520
 when a person is operated from a 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:37.900
 refractive defect can be a candidate 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.420
 suffer any type of pathology 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:43.420
 ocular glaucoma like detachment of 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:45.280
 retina or any disease what 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:48.370
 happens is that the previous treatment 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:50.590
 really with refractive surgery not 

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:52.990
 it has to influence the immense 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:56.550
 most of the cases in solving 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:56.550
 none of these pathologies 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:08.270
 when a person has intervened 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:10.340
 refractive surgery with laser and after 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:13.040
 a few years old has a tired sight 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:15.230
 expertise can be operated again for 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.810
 correct this problem occurred 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:20.450
 such that the ophthalmologist will choose the 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:22.580
 technique well be combined vision well 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.900
 be implantation of multifocal lenses that 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:26.590
 more suit the patient according to their 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.590
 characteristics
