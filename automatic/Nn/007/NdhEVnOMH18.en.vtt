 the use of the word that of the verb 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:28.020
 smart and humorous 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.820
 another trait of his personality 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.130
 the commitment you stéphane hessel for 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.079
 freedom human rights and the 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.770
 secularism translated into a 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:39.570
 impressive message voluntarist 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:42.030
 addressed to youth 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.579
 we are gathered today to 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:47.820
 pay tribute to an exceptional man 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:50.939
 a man who had become a legend of 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:53.909
 alive and whose influential father 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:56.640
 will last a very long time it is only at the 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:59.759
 end of his life that stéphane hessel is 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:03.439
 become a moral conscience a 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:03.439
 moral conscience of all his time 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:25.060
 indignation is only a motor but 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:27.760
 commitment is absolutely 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.530
 indispensable indignation are without 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:32.980
 commitment it does not matter 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:36.489
 and that he repeated the effort at each 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:40.540
 opportunity he said he can not there 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:45.310
 have unlimited desire and that the 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:47.769
 limit to desire it's the law but it's 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:51.299
 for that he engaged on the 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:54.430
 Palestine because the law was violated 

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:56.950
 and among the values ​​of the ulb and among 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:59.590
 the projects of the ulb the one that defends 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:02.170
 stéphane hessel is obviously very 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:04.480
 very close to free examination or 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:06.130
 criticism but also the desire to 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.739
 engage in society and not 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:11.350
 only to stay indented in a 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:13.810
 academic posture i would say they 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:17.560
 look at the world without blaming 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:19.660
 interact with him peace it's also 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:21.549
 the fight of a life of stéphane hessel 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:23.440
 who are calling us to indignation for 

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:24.940
 preserve peace it's very important 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:26.709
 it was important for us too 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:27.489
 associate it with the founders of the ulb worst 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:30.160
 dragon killers 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:30.790
 because by joining them here in this 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.500
 symbolic place 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:34.660
 we also give the signal that two 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:36.820
 Mature men had to 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:39.670
 concern our greatest wealth 

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:41.400
 youth and it is this youth capital 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:43.720
 that we often despise these days 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.290
 for which we want to testify to the 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:46.540
 trust 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:48.480
 as I say in the union between 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:51.340
 young and old 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:53.620
 each has its share of shaded light but 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:55.000
 my friend earlier we talked about here 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:56.890
 three people who will talk to each other 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.050
 for a long time yet that is francisco 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:00.760
 shoe that I'm dragging us that this 

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:02.200
 either to stéphane hessel in the background their 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:02.500
 basically fundamentally fight is 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.390
 herself 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:05.590
 these are great humanists who have 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:07.900
 beaten for the emancipation of individuals 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:10.629
 an emancipation that is built only 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:12.250
 through education egalitarian communication and 

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:14.319
 which actually allows to opt for 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:16.150
 a vision of the world where progress takes 

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:17.620
 a place that is the result of a 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:20.699
 conversation of a learning rather 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:20.699
 that a struggle and antagonism 

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:37.610
 gave the horizon the model also 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:41.410
 riber 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:41.410
 the reason
