00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.430
 hello to all and only 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.870
 apple ipod touch point fr is 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.809
 today in this video I you 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.889
 explain how to free up space 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:12.840
 on the harbor 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.429
 I do not mean to add it because 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.500
 if we must add but just in 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.660
 to release I put you in situation 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.859
 the oar actually she stops files 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.689
 above so for example when you 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.029
 put your mac in standby it will store 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.199
 files on them for example they 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.109
 have given you a download it will 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.160
 stop the download so when the 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.460
 oar is full if you run 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:35.360
 several programs the showcase roma and 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:38.399
 after they store on your hard drive 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:42.090
 he pressed the case to say it is that 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:44.940
 it reams super so to avoid this 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:49.350
 sort of things first a solution 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:52.770
 to close applications that do not 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:55.500
 are useless we try that those who 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:01:00.180
 so close message it is useless 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:01.410
 so I close it here it closes this 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.989
 that will make me a little bit of Ram 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.780
 of the lung and its 44 megan ram or 20 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:09.390
 mega it always plays for speed 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:16.770
 programs so we'll go in 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:19.979
 first on the activity monitor and there 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:22.799
 we will see that on the one can see the 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.659
 activities kept up so we 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:27.630
 can see everything on the processor of the 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.790
 time and we can see the activity of the 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.390
 disc so we can see that with the oar 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.390
 on an imac 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:40.890
 what can we see is that two 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:43.590
 hard drives there 28.31 gigabyte so that 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:46.979
 read in 30 here finally here is so we 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.540
 do not care you use insure yeah 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.390
 so we just have a little bit but what 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:55.290
 will interest us in the system memory 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:59.689
 so the system memory is just 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.689
 something that will allow to 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:10.320
 more quickly so I am now 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:12.979
 on my session will surely make it Tuesday I 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:12.979
 I'm getting millions 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:24.930
 yeah so I'm afraid we liked that 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:25.830
 because good con no chains is 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.540
 because we would have said what she 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:33.120
 said no i 'm not on my computer i'm 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:36.330
 on another so here's uh you go 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.980
 power there available 742 mega on 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:40.230
 four guys 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:43.980
 so it's still a little weird 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:47.160
 when for a guy who makes 500 gigabytes 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:51.150
 imac during I can the same name as I 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:55.530
 release enough so we will use him the 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:03:01.440
 terminal that your habits and we 're going 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:08.730
 go and hit purge so cpu air and so 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:11.010
 we look at the numbers well here it is 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:13.860
 frees space 923 from a simple three 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:16.050
 indices is therefore released in space does not 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:18.480
 fart not thirty times he worked the 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:20.940
 will hardly release the space 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.480
 so that's it for this video and at the 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:23.580
 next 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:26.550
