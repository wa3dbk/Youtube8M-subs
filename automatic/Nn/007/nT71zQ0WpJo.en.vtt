00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
one here it's going to come up I forgot

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.809 
one here it's going to come up I forgot
to<00:02:53.680> get<00:02:53.799> it<00:02:53.859> but<00:02:54.069> I<00:02:54.129> need<00:02:54.310> to<00:02:54.400> get<00:02:54.489> one<00:02:54.639> of<00:02:54.730> these

00:02:54.809 --> 00:02:54.819 
to get it but I need to get one of these

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:56.819 
to get it but I need to get one of these
I<00:02:55.389> thought<00:02:56.019> you<00:02:56.200> could<00:02:56.290> use<00:02:56.319> this<00:02:56.590> one<00:02:56.739> from

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:56.829 
I thought you could use this one from

00:02:56.829 --> 00:02:58.890 
I thought you could use this one from
last<00:02:57.040> year<00:02:57.189> but<00:02:57.370> it's<00:02:57.459> a<00:02:57.489> different<00:02:57.760> size<00:02:57.900> just

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
last year but it's a different size just

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.920 
last year but it's a different size just
a<00:02:59.079> faucet<00:02:59.790> the<00:03:00.790> side<00:03:00.970> is<00:03:01.180> different<00:03:01.629> than<00:03:01.810> last

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
a faucet the side is different than last

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:04.710 
a faucet the side is different than last
year<00:03:02.200> so<00:03:02.409> if<00:03:02.980> you<00:03:03.069> get<00:03:03.159> one<00:03:03.189> of<00:03:03.340> those<00:03:03.459> and<00:03:03.730> the

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 
year so if you get one of those and the

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.559 
year so if you get one of those and the
reason<00:03:04.930> I'm<00:03:04.989> doing<00:03:05.049> that<00:03:05.230> for<00:03:05.379> here<00:03:05.980> is<00:03:06.569> gonna

00:03:07.559 --> 00:03:07.569 
reason I'm doing that for here is gonna

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:09.720 
reason I'm doing that for here is gonna
put<00:03:07.780> a<00:03:07.810> sprinkler<00:03:08.200> valve<00:03:08.230> I<00:03:08.650> mean<00:03:08.859> a<00:03:08.889> faucet

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:09.730 
put a sprinkler valve I mean a faucet

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:11.970 
put a sprinkler valve I mean a faucet
here<00:03:10.060> and<00:03:10.269> then<00:03:10.780> run<00:03:10.900> a<00:03:10.930> hose<00:03:11.139> to<00:03:11.349> my<00:03:11.439> sprinkler

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980 
here and then run a hose to my sprinkler

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:15.030 
here and then run a hose to my sprinkler
which<00:03:12.129> is<00:03:12.310> a<00:03:13.290> standard<00:03:14.290> you<00:03:14.680> know<00:03:14.709> Rain<00:03:15.010> Bird

I just disconnected the mechanism so

00:03:19.419 --> 00:03:20.610 
I just disconnected the mechanism so
when<00:03:19.540> it<00:03:19.629> comes<00:03:19.750> on<00:03:19.900> is<00:03:20.019> just<00:03:20.169> great<00:03:20.349> straight

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:20.620 
when it comes on is just great straight

00:03:28.189 --> 00:03:28.199 
when I get over here okay so here is the

completed fountain we've got one jet now

00:03:33.669 --> 00:03:34.909 
completed fountain we've got one jet now
this<00:03:33.819> is<00:03:33.940> supposed<00:03:34.060> to<00:03:34.209> be<00:03:34.269> jumping<00:03:34.480> arch

00:03:34.909 --> 00:03:34.919 
this is supposed to be jumping arch

00:03:34.919 --> 00:03:38.640 
this is supposed to be jumping arch
planes<00:03:35.919> change<00:03:36.870> so<00:03:37.870> it's<00:03:38.019> now<00:03:38.139> just<00:03:38.379> shooting

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:38.650 
planes change so it's now just shooting

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:41.550 
planes change so it's now just shooting
straight<00:03:38.829> up<00:03:38.889> what<00:03:39.729> it<00:03:39.849> is<00:03:39.970> so<00:03:40.329> it<00:03:40.540> was<00:03:40.690> too

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560 
straight up what it is so it was too

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.640 
straight up what it is so it was too
strong<00:03:41.829> as<00:03:42.069> a<00:03:42.519> one<00:03:42.909> single<00:03:43.359> channel<00:03:43.720> channeled

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:44.650 
strong as a one single channel channeled

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:48.990 
strong as a one single channel channeled
arch<00:03:45.430> I<00:03:45.879> mean<00:03:46.690> single<00:03:47.199> channel<00:03:47.470> jet<00:03:48.250> to<00:03:48.849> be

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.000 
arch I mean single channel jet to be

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.319 
arch I mean single channel jet to be
able<00:03:49.150> to<00:03:49.299> curve<00:03:49.629> this<00:03:50.139> minimum<00:03:50.859> distance<00:03:51.329> I

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:52.329 
able to curve this minimum distance I

00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:54.539 
able to curve this minimum distance I
would<00:03:52.810> have<00:03:52.930> to<00:03:53.500> it<00:03:53.530> just<00:03:53.829> slightly<00:03:54.099> for

00:03:54.539 --> 00:03:54.549 
would have to it just slightly for

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:56.969 
would have to it just slightly for
it<00:03:54.609> to<00:03:54.699> go<00:03:54.849> all<00:03:55.030> the<00:03:55.209> way<00:03:55.239> up<00:03:55.449> and<00:03:55.720> then<00:03:56.680> come

00:03:56.969 --> 00:03:56.979 
it to go all the way up and then come

00:03:56.979 --> 00:03:58.559 
it to go all the way up and then come
down<00:03:57.010> and<00:03:57.370> hit<00:03:57.489> the<00:03:57.669> hit<00:03:58.060> the<00:03:58.090> bucket<00:03:58.449> in<00:03:58.510> the

00:03:58.559 --> 00:03:58.569 
down and hit the hit the bucket in the

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:01.289 
down and hit the hit the bucket in the
right<00:03:58.659> spot<00:03:58.959> so<00:03:59.290> it<00:04:00.250> wasn't<00:04:00.609> the<00:04:00.819> effect<00:04:01.180> I

00:04:01.289 --> 00:04:01.299 
right spot so it wasn't the effect I

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:03.030 
right spot so it wasn't the effect I
wanted<00:04:01.629> so<00:04:01.840> it<00:04:01.989> went<00:04:02.109> straight<00:04:02.409> up<00:04:02.560> now<00:04:02.739> it

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:03.040 
wanted so it went straight up now it

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.610 
wanted so it went straight up now it
still<00:04:03.430> shoots<00:04:03.669> quite<00:04:04.120> quite<00:04:04.599> high<00:04:04.750> but<00:04:05.019> it's

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:05.620 
still shoots quite quite high but it's

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:07.710 
still shoots quite quite high but it's
just<00:04:05.709> a<00:04:05.859> single<00:04:06.129> straight<00:04:06.340> up<00:04:06.459> this<00:04:07.030> is<00:04:07.329> the

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:07.720 
just a single straight up this is the

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:08.909 
just a single straight up this is the
channel<00:04:07.959> that<00:04:08.079> was<00:04:08.199> supposed<00:04:08.409> to<00:04:08.440> be<00:04:08.560> my<00:04:08.680> water

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:08.919 
channel that was supposed to be my water

00:04:08.919 --> 00:04:15.030 
channel that was supposed to be my water
wall<00:04:09.159> which<00:04:12.090> kind<00:04:13.090> of<00:04:13.209> expected<00:04:14.019> to<00:04:14.049> fail<00:04:14.829> on

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:15.040 
wall which kind of expected to fail on

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:16.979 
wall which kind of expected to fail on
that<00:04:15.099> which<00:04:15.699> now<00:04:16.209> we<00:04:16.269> just<00:04:16.419> have<00:04:16.539> two<00:04:16.720> jets

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:16.989 
that which now we just have two jets

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:19.769 
that which now we just have two jets
that<00:04:17.169> come<00:04:17.440> up<00:04:17.650> they<00:04:18.280> only<00:04:18.430> shoot<00:04:18.699> up<00:04:18.880> yeah

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:19.779 
that come up they only shoot up yeah

00:04:19.779 --> 00:04:22.399 
that come up they only shoot up yeah
because<00:04:20.109> they're<00:04:20.349> on<00:04:20.680> at<00:04:20.829> the<00:04:20.889> same<00:04:21.039> time<00:04:21.099> um

00:04:22.399 --> 00:04:22.409 
because they're on at the same time um

00:04:22.409 --> 00:04:24.450 
because they're on at the same time um
we've<00:04:23.409> got<00:04:23.469> our<00:04:23.680> Center

I've<00:04:26.259> removed<00:04:26.319> the<00:04:27.009> mechanism<00:04:27.669> to<00:04:27.789> make<00:04:27.940> it<00:04:28.060> go

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:28.180 
I've removed the mechanism to make it go

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:30.330 
I've removed the mechanism to make it go
back<00:04:28.300> and<00:04:28.479> forth<00:04:28.750> but<00:04:29.530> it<00:04:29.650> gives<00:04:29.800> a<00:04:29.860> good<00:04:30.009> fan

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:30.340 
back and forth but it gives a good fan

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:34.230 
back and forth but it gives a good fan
defect<00:04:30.759> and<00:04:31.030> then<00:04:31.569> I've<00:04:31.660> got<00:04:32.250> five<00:04:33.250> jets<00:04:33.699> on

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:34.240 
defect and then I've got five jets on

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:39.059 
defect and then I've got five jets on
