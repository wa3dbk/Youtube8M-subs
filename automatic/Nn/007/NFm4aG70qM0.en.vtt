00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.479 
not going to be choppy or anything like
that<00:02:24.440> okay<00:02:25.440> so<00:02:25.500> the<00:02:25.709> video<00:02:25.920> is<00:02:25.980> done<00:02:26.250> rendering

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:26.489 
that okay so the video is done rendering

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:28.580 
that okay so the video is done rendering
and<00:02:26.879> you<00:02:27.030> can<00:02:27.209> tell<00:02:27.420> that<00:02:27.540> it<00:02:27.659> is<00:02:27.690> finished<00:02:28.230> by

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
and you can tell that it is finished by

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.289 
and you can tell that it is finished by
the<00:02:28.650> fact<00:02:28.980> that<00:02:29.129> we<00:02:29.220> have<00:02:29.400> a<00:02:29.430> green<00:02:29.940> line<00:02:30.269> here

00:02:30.289 --> 00:02:30.299 
the fact that we have a green line here

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:32.180 
the fact that we have a green line here
instead<00:02:31.110> of<00:02:31.170> the<00:02:31.379> yellow<00:02:31.620> one<00:02:31.799> that<00:02:31.950> we<00:02:32.010> saw

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
instead of the yellow one that we saw

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.520 
instead of the yellow one that we saw
before<00:02:32.400> so<00:02:32.790> you<00:02:33.629> can<00:02:33.750> go<00:02:33.840> ahead<00:02:33.959> and<00:02:34.079> preview

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530

with the time-lapse

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.289 
with the time-lapse
you<00:02:43.799> can<00:02:44.159> export<00:02:44.640> it<00:02:44.760> so<00:02:45.569> just<00:02:45.660> go<00:02:45.810> file<00:02:46.170> export

00:02:47.289 --> 00:02:47.299 
you can export it so just go file export

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:50.839 
you can export it so just go file export
media<00:02:48.299> and<00:02:48.829> if<00:02:49.829> you're<00:02:50.040> uploading<00:02:50.549> it<00:02:50.819> to

make<00:02:51.780> sure<00:02:51.989> your<00:02:52.140> format<00:02:52.560> is<00:02:53.120> h.264<00:02:54.120> and<00:02:54.739> there

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 
make sure your format is h.264 and there

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:59.270 
make sure your format is h.264 and there
is<00:02:55.859> actually<00:02:56.340> a<00:02:56.370> youtube<00:02:57.150> preset<00:02:58.049> so<00:02:58.980> just

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
is actually a youtube preset so just

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.289 
is actually a youtube preset so just
click<00:02:59.459> on<00:02:59.609> the<00:02:59.790> widescreen<00:03:00.150> HD<00:03:00.450> one<00:03:00.870> and

00:03:02.289 --> 00:03:02.299 
click on the widescreen HD one and

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:04.610 
click on the widescreen HD one and
that's<00:03:03.299> pretty<00:03:03.450> much<00:03:03.569> it<00:03:03.659> you<00:03:03.870> click<00:03:04.140> export

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
that's pretty much it you click export

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.039 
that's pretty much it you click export
and<00:03:04.739> then<00:03:04.829> you<00:03:04.920> upload<00:03:05.040> it<00:03:05.310> to<00:03:05.430> YouTube<00:03:06.049> the

00:03:07.039 --> 00:03:07.049 
and then you upload it to YouTube the

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:08.630 
and then you upload it to YouTube the
only<00:03:07.230> thing<00:03:07.349> I<00:03:07.409> wanted<00:03:07.620> to<00:03:07.709> comment<00:03:07.920> on<00:03:08.220> was

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
only thing I wanted to comment on was

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.550 
only thing I wanted to comment on was
the<00:03:08.849> frame<00:03:09.329> rate<00:03:09.569> that<00:03:09.599> I<00:03:09.750> selected<00:03:10.230> earlier

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
the frame rate that I selected earlier

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:15.710 
the frame rate that I selected earlier
it<00:03:10.769> was<00:03:10.920> 29.97<00:03:12.079> frames<00:03:13.079> per<00:03:13.319> second<00:03:13.739> on<00:03:14.720> so

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
it was 29.97 frames per second on so

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.300 
it was 29.97 frames per second on so
basically<00:03:16.079> if<00:03:16.319> you<00:03:16.349> know<00:03:16.530> the<00:03:17.040> number<00:03:17.280> of

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
basically if you know the number of

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.610 
basically if you know the number of
pictures<00:03:17.669> that<00:03:17.849> you<00:03:18.120> took<00:03:18.389> and<00:03:18.660> the<00:03:19.349> frame

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
pictures that you took and the frame

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.379 
pictures that you took and the frame
rate<00:03:19.650> that<00:03:19.919> you've<00:03:20.040> selected<00:03:20.220> you<00:03:21.209> can

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:21.389 
rate that you've selected you can

00:03:21.389 --> 00:03:23.809 
rate that you've selected you can
determine<00:03:22.139> how<00:03:22.560> long<00:03:22.889> the<00:03:23.130> video<00:03:23.310> is<00:03:23.579> going<00:03:23.730> to

00:03:23.809 --> 00:03:23.819 
determine how long the video is going to

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:27.470 
determine how long the video is going to
be<00:03:24.109> so<00:03:25.109> in<00:03:25.260> my<00:03:25.410> case<00:03:25.709> I<00:03:26.040> took<00:03:26.549> one<00:03:26.760> thousand<00:03:27.269> two

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
be so in my case I took one thousand two

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.690 
be so in my case I took one thousand two
hundred<00:03:27.510> and<00:03:27.870> eighty<00:03:28.109> eight<00:03:28.200> pictures<00:03:28.799> and<00:03:29.069> if

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
hundred and eighty eight pictures and if

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.390 
hundred and eighty eight pictures and if
that's<00:03:29.879> played<00:03:30.150> back<00:03:30.359> at<00:03:30.569> 29.97<00:03:31.560> frames<00:03:32.190> per

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
that's played back at 29.97 frames per

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.220 
that's played back at 29.97 frames per
second<00:03:32.790> you<00:03:33.359> end<00:03:33.510> up<00:03:33.629> with<00:03:33.750> a<00:03:33.780> video<00:03:33.930> that's

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
second you end up with a video that's

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:37.069 
second you end up with a video that's
just<00:03:34.620> under<00:03:35.010> 43<00:03:35.549> seconds<00:03:36.120> so<00:03:36.810> it's<00:03:36.930> really

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:37.079 
just under 43 seconds so it's really

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:38.720 
just under 43 seconds so it's really
easy<00:03:37.169> to<00:03:37.379> calculate<00:03:37.590> you<00:03:38.280> just<00:03:38.459> take<00:03:38.609> the

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 
easy to calculate you just take the

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:40.849 
easy to calculate you just take the
number<00:03:38.760> of<00:03:39.060> pictures<00:03:39.349> divided<00:03:40.349> by<00:03:40.470> the<00:03:40.530> frame

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:40.859 
number of pictures divided by the frame

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:43.369 
number of pictures divided by the frame
rate<00:03:41.069> and<00:03:41.250> then<00:03:41.879> you<00:03:41.910> have<00:03:42.180> the<00:03:42.510> final<00:03:43.169> length

00:03:43.369 --> 00:03:43.379 
rate and then you have the final length

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:47.420 
rate and then you have the final length
of<00:03:43.590> the<00:03:44.010> time<00:03:44.310> lapse<00:03:44.579> video<00:03:46.430> my

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
of the time lapse video my

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:49.039 
of the time lapse video my
recommendation<00:03:48.060> is<00:03:48.180> to<00:03:48.209> keep<00:03:48.480> the<00:03:48.629> time-lapse

00:03:49.039 --> 00:03:49.049 
recommendation is to keep the time-lapse

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:52.309 
recommendation is to keep the time-lapse
videos<00:03:49.410> you<00:03:50.220> know<00:03:50.340> short<00:03:50.790> in<00:03:51.000> between<00:03:51.629> 30<00:03:52.109> and

00:03:52.309 --> 00:03:52.319 
videos you know short in between 30 and

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:55.309 
videos you know short in between 30 and
45<00:03:52.859> seconds<00:03:53.549> is<00:03:53.699> ideal<00:03:54.359> in<00:03:54.629> my<00:03:54.810> opinion

00:03:55.309 --> 00:03:55.319 
45 seconds is ideal in my opinion

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:58.119 
45 seconds is ideal in my opinion
anything<00:03:56.280> longer<00:03:56.489> than<00:03:56.609> that<00:03:56.940> and<00:03:57.150> viewers

00:03:58.119 --> 00:03:58.129 
anything longer than that and viewers

00:03:58.129 --> 00:04:01.220 
anything longer than that and viewers
become<00:03:59.129> less<00:03:59.340> interested<00:03:59.970> and<00:04:00.239> they'll<00:04:00.959> want

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.230 
become less interested and they'll want

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:04.309 
become less interested and they'll want
to<00:04:01.440> move<00:04:01.620> on<00:04:01.799> to<00:04:01.980> the<00:04:02.069> next<00:04:02.250> video<00:04:03.169> so<00:04:04.169> that's
