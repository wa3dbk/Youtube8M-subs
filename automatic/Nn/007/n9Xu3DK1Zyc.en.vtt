00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
and today in this corner guys we have

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.490 
and today in this corner guys we have
the<00:00:14.490> Allosaurus<00:00:15.240> who<00:00:15.389> in<00:00:15.599> my<00:00:15.750> opinion<00:00:15.780> is<00:00:16.230> the

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
the Allosaurus who in my opinion is the

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:17.960 
the Allosaurus who in my opinion is the
favorite<00:00:16.890> to<00:00:17.010> win<00:00:17.039> as<00:00:17.369> you<00:00:17.609> can<00:00:17.730> see<00:00:17.850> this

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
favorite to win as you can see this

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:19.370 
favorite to win as you can see this
beast<00:00:18.270> comes<00:00:18.600> up<00:00:18.750> with<00:00:18.840> a<00:00:18.900> pretty<00:00:19.170> decent

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
beast comes up with a pretty decent

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.290 
beast comes up with a pretty decent
height<00:00:19.770> it's<00:00:20.250> got<00:00:20.400> quite<00:00:20.520> a<00:00:20.640> bit<00:00:20.789> of<00:00:20.880> speed<00:00:21.029> and

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
height it's got quite a bit of speed and

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.570 
height it's got quite a bit of speed and
it<00:00:21.660> can<00:00:21.779> give<00:00:21.900> a<00:00:21.930> t-rex<00:00:22.320> a<00:00:22.560> bit<00:00:22.769> of<00:00:22.859> a<00:00:22.920> run<00:00:23.130> for

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
it can give a t-rex a bit of a run for

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.580 
it can give a t-rex a bit of a run for
its<00:00:23.730> money<00:00:23.789> I'm<00:00:24.269> pretty<00:00:24.779> confident<00:00:25.230> it's<00:00:25.470> got

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
its money I'm pretty confident it's got

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:26.660 
its money I'm pretty confident it's got
a<00:00:25.619> chance<00:00:25.890> today<00:00:26.039> so<00:00:26.189> we're<00:00:26.340> gonna<00:00:26.430> see<00:00:26.580> the

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
a chance today so we're gonna see the

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:27.890 
a chance today so we're gonna see the
carry<00:00:26.880> over<00:00:27.029> to<00:00:27.060> the<00:00:27.180> other<00:00:27.269> side<00:00:27.480> to<00:00:27.660> see<00:00:27.810> the

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
carry over to the other side to see the

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.919 
carry over to the other side to see the
Dino<00:00:28.109> -<00:00:28.349> sheis<00:00:28.560> and<00:00:29.010> in<00:00:29.970> this<00:00:30.119> corner<00:00:30.420> guys<00:00:30.660> we

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
Dino - sheis and in this corner guys we

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.280 
Dino - sheis and in this corner guys we
have<00:00:31.230> the<00:00:31.590> Dino<00:00:31.890> sushi<00:00:32.399> a<00:00:32.610> big<00:00:33.090> bad<00:00:33.540> crocodile

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
have the Dino sushi a big bad crocodile

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.410 
have the Dino sushi a big bad crocodile
that's<00:00:34.530> gonna<00:00:34.770> probably<00:00:35.340> put<00:00:35.520> a<00:00:35.730> few<00:00:36.000> puncture

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
that's gonna probably put a few puncture

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.450 
that's gonna probably put a few puncture
wounds<00:00:36.690> in<00:00:36.809> the<00:00:36.960> Allosaurus<00:00:37.469> but<00:00:38.190> I<00:00:38.219> think

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
wounds in the Allosaurus but I think

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:39.920 
wounds in the Allosaurus but I think
Allosaurus<00:00:38.879> is<00:00:38.940> speed<00:00:39.239> is<00:00:39.450> definitely<00:00:39.600> gonna

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
Allosaurus is speed is definitely gonna

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.119 
Allosaurus is speed is definitely gonna
be<00:00:40.020> something<00:00:40.350> that's<00:00:40.379> gonna<00:00:40.590> make<00:00:40.710> it<00:00:40.829> a<00:00:40.980> lot

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
be something that's gonna make it a lot

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.490 
be something that's gonna make it a lot
more<00:00:41.160> formidable<00:00:41.730> as<00:00:41.850> opposed<00:00:42.510> to<00:00:42.660> come<00:00:43.379> back

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
more formidable as opposed to come back

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.880 
more formidable as opposed to come back
here<00:00:43.710> Dino<00:00:44.640> sushis<00:00:45.210> his<00:00:45.420> attack<00:00:46.230> and<00:00:46.410> health

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
here Dino sushis his attack and health

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.619 
here Dino sushis his attack and health
so<00:00:47.070> I'm<00:00:47.250> thinking<00:00:47.579> this<00:00:47.760> is<00:00:47.969> gonna<00:00:48.059> be<00:00:48.239> a<00:00:48.270> very

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
so I'm thinking this is gonna be a very

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:49.880 
so I'm thinking this is gonna be a very
even<00:00:49.020> fights<00:00:49.230> we're<00:00:49.379> gonna<00:00:49.469> cut<00:00:49.680> to<00:00:49.770> that

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
even fights we're gonna cut to that

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.100 
even fights we're gonna cut to that
fight<00:00:50.100> now<00:00:50.309> make<00:00:51.239> sure<00:00:51.270> you<00:00:51.449> guys<00:00:51.600> put<00:00:51.899> down<00:00:52.020> in

cut it now guys enjoy start this now

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.529 
cut it now guys enjoy start this now
before<00:00:59.010> they<00:00:59.280> do<00:00:59.460> get<00:00:59.670> to<00:00:59.820> separate<00:01:00.210> parts

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
before they do get to separate parts

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.240 
before they do get to separate parts
we're<00:01:00.660> just<00:01:00.780> gonna<00:01:00.870> hit<00:01:01.079> the<00:01:01.320> dinosaurs

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
we're just gonna hit the dinosaurs

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.709 
we're just gonna hit the dinosaurs
because<00:01:02.399> it<00:01:02.489> has<00:01:02.640> the<00:01:02.760> advantage<00:01:03.180> of<00:01:03.390> one

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
because it has the advantage of one

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.479 
because it has the advantage of one
damage<00:01:04.229> at<00:01:04.320> all<00:01:04.439> I'm<00:01:04.589> going<00:01:04.680> to<00:01:04.739> do<00:01:04.890> and<00:01:05.129> the

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
damage at all I'm going to do and the

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:06.649 
damage at all I'm going to do and the
other<00:01:05.610> soros<00:01:05.880> is<00:01:05.970> going<00:01:06.180> ahead<00:01:06.270> and<00:01:06.540> it's

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
other soros is going ahead and it's

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.300 
other soros is going ahead and it's
absolutely<00:01:06.990> wiping<00:01:07.740> the<00:01:07.830> floor<00:01:08.010> with<00:01:08.159> the

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
absolutely wiping the floor with the

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:09.679 
absolutely wiping the floor with the
dinosaur<00:01:08.640> the<00:01:08.880> town<00:01:09.060> of<00:01:09.180> sushi<00:01:09.360> isn't

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
dinosaur the town of sushi isn't

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.750 
dinosaur the town of sushi isn't
attacking<00:01:10.110> I<00:01:10.470> don't<00:01:11.040> know<00:01:11.159> why<00:01:11.369> it<00:01:11.430> was

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
attacking I don't know why it was

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.850 
attacking I don't know why it was
attacking<00:01:12.060> previously<00:01:12.659> and<00:01:12.869> I<00:01:13.170> think<00:01:13.380> it's

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
attacking previously and I think it's

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.039 
attacking previously and I think it's
probably<00:01:14.040> to<00:01:14.220> win<00:01:14.369> this<00:01:14.520> one<00:01:14.760> which<00:01:15.750> it<00:01:15.869> does

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
probably to win this one which it does

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.289 
probably to win this one which it does
so<00:01:16.290> this<00:01:16.439> is<00:01:16.560> round<00:01:16.830> 1<00:01:17.159> round<00:01:17.790> 2<00:01:17.970> I'm<00:01:18.119> going<00:01:18.240> to

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
so this is round 1 round 2 I'm going to

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:19.550 
so this is round 1 round 2 I'm going to
just<00:01:18.420> try<00:01:18.630> a<00:01:18.659> different<00:01:18.840> theory<00:01:19.229> that<00:01:19.350> I<00:01:19.409> have

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
just try a different theory that I have

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.649 
just try a different theory that I have
by<00:01:19.890> trying<00:01:20.189> a<00:01:20.310> different<00:01:20.340> Dino<00:01:20.700> sushi<00:01:21.000> and

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
by trying a different Dino sushi and

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.390 
by trying a different Dino sushi and
we're<00:01:21.869> gonna<00:01:21.960> head<00:01:22.200> and<00:01:22.409> try<00:01:22.920> that<00:01:23.040> now<00:01:23.159> guys

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
we're gonna head and try that now guys

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.830 
we're gonna head and try that now guys
okay<00:01:23.610> guys<00:01:24.210> so<00:01:24.330> we've<00:01:24.450> gone<00:01:24.540> ahead<00:01:24.600> and

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
okay guys so we've gone ahead and

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.420 
okay guys so we've gone ahead and
actually<00:01:25.140> managed<00:01:25.530> to<00:01:25.590> get<00:01:25.799> the<00:01:25.950> other<00:01:26.130> type

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
actually managed to get the other type

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:27.620 
actually managed to get the other type
of<00:01:26.460> dinosaur<00:01:26.729> she's<00:01:27.060> different<00:01:27.270> color<00:01:27.509> you

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
of dinosaur she's different color you

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.270 
of dinosaur she's different color you
can<00:01:27.750> see<00:01:27.900> here<00:01:28.200> I<00:01:28.229> believe<00:01:28.409> is<00:01:28.500> this<00:01:28.979> one<00:01:29.159> maybe

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
can see here I believe is this one maybe

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.230 
can see here I believe is this one maybe
male<00:01:29.579> or<00:01:29.729> female

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
male or female

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.090 
male or female
where<00:01:30.659> is<00:01:30.720> the<00:01:30.810> other<00:01:30.960> one<00:01:31.140> OOP<00:01:31.320> let's<00:01:31.979> get

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
where is the other one OOP let's get

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.130 
where is the other one OOP let's get
back<00:01:32.220> there<00:01:32.540> seems<00:01:33.540> to<00:01:33.600> be<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:33.840> other<00:01:33.960> one

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
back there seems to be the other one

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.990 
back there seems to be the other one

let's go ahead and just tap it once
again<00:01:36.180> and<00:01:36.570> see<00:01:37.020> where<00:01:37.140> it<00:01:37.200> goes<00:01:37.290> from<00:01:37.350> there

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950
