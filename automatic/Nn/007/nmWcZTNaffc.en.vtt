I'm going to show you a little bit of

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.109 
I'm going to show you a little bit of
what<00:00:23.880> your<00:00:24.150> locker<00:00:24.449> could<00:00:24.930> look<00:00:25.710> like<00:00:26.119> with

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
what your locker could look like with

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.000 
what your locker could look like with

and without organization

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.669 
and without organization
so<00:00:29.130> first<00:00:29.490> the<00:00:30.449> picture<00:00:30.840> that<00:00:31.019> I<00:00:31.080> see<00:00:31.349> most

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
so first the picture that I see most

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.830 
so first the picture that I see most
often<00:00:32.009> when<00:00:32.610> I'm<00:00:32.730> looking<00:00:32.940> at<00:00:33.329> a<00:00:33.540> middle

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
often when I'm looking at a middle

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:39.540 
often when I'm looking at a middle
schoolers<00:00:34.200> locker

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:39.550 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:41.460 

now<00:00:39.730> a<00:00:39.760> shot<00:00:40.180> of<00:00:40.450> what<00:00:40.720> it<00:00:40.870> could<00:00:41.170> look<00:00:41.410> like

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:41.470 
now a shot of what it could look like

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:44.340 
now a shot of what it could look like
with<00:00:42.280> just<00:00:42.460> a<00:00:42.640> little<00:00:42.880> bit<00:00:43.060> of<00:00:43.240> effort<00:00:43.360> and<00:00:43.690> the

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:44.350 
with just a little bit of effort and the

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:47.490 
with just a little bit of effort and the
right<00:00:44.560> tools

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:47.500 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.350 

so<00:00:48.500> key<00:00:48.710> number<00:00:49.010> one<00:00:49.040> you<00:00:49.520> need<00:00:49.730> to<00:00:49.880> have<00:00:50.090> the

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:50.360 
so key number one you need to have the

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.290 
so key number one you need to have the
right<00:00:50.600> materials<00:00:51.460> go<00:00:52.460> ahead<00:00:52.640> and<00:00:52.760> get<00:00:52.880> an<00:00:52.970> idea

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:53.300 
right materials go ahead and get an idea

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.770 
right materials go ahead and get an idea
of<00:00:53.390> how<00:00:53.750> just<00:00:54.170> how<00:00:54.440> big<00:00:54.890> your<00:00:55.190> locker<00:00:55.460> is<00:00:55.910> most

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:56.780 
of how just how big your locker is most

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:58.450 
of how just how big your locker is most
of<00:00:56.930> the<00:00:57.020> time<00:00:57.170> you<00:00:57.320> can<00:00:57.500> find<00:00:57.740> stacking

00:00:58.450 --> 00:00:58.460 
of the time you can find stacking

00:00:58.460 --> 00:00:59.860 
of the time you can find stacking
shelves<00:00:58.490> I'll<00:00:59.060> show<00:00:59.210> you<00:00:59.270> a<00:00:59.360> quick<00:00:59.510> picture<00:00:59.750> of

00:00:59.860 --> 00:00:59.870 
shelves I'll show you a quick picture of

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:02.850 
shelves I'll show you a quick picture of
one<00:01:00.020> of<00:01:00.110> those

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:02.860 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:05.530 

these<00:01:03.860> range<00:01:04.309> in<00:01:04.580> height<00:01:04.820> but<00:01:05.059> typically

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:05.540 
these range in height but typically

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:09.430 
these range in height but typically
about<00:01:05.810> a<00:01:06.080> foot<00:01:06.530> the<00:01:06.830> 13<00:01:07.250> inches<00:01:07.670> tall<00:01:08.440> usually

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:09.440 
about a foot the 13 inches tall usually

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:12.190 
about a foot the 13 inches tall usually
one<00:01:09.710> to<00:01:09.740> two<00:01:09.920> of<00:01:10.280> these<00:01:10.490> will<00:01:11.030> fit<00:01:11.300> in<00:01:11.540> a<00:01:11.630> locker

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:12.200 
one to two of these will fit in a locker

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.190 
one to two of these will fit in a locker
I<00:01:12.229> recommend<00:01:13.100> the<00:01:13.640> metal<00:01:14.119> stacking<00:01:14.960> type

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:15.200 
I recommend the metal stacking type

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.620 
I recommend the metal stacking type
because<00:01:15.950> they're<00:01:16.130> fairly<00:01:16.550> durable<00:01:16.790> that's

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:17.630 
because they're fairly durable that's

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:20.290 
because they're fairly durable that's
number<00:01:17.869> one<00:01:18.170> number<00:01:18.380> two<00:01:18.530> a<00:01:19.009> couple<00:01:19.520> paths<00:01:19.880> of

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:20.300 
number one number two a couple paths of

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:22.960 
number one number two a couple paths of
sticky<00:01:20.720> notes<00:01:20.860> those<00:01:21.860> go<00:01:22.100> on<00:01:22.280> the<00:01:22.400> inside<00:01:22.759> of

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:22.970 
sticky notes those go on the inside of

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:24.730 
sticky notes those go on the inside of
the<00:01:23.030> locker<00:01:23.270> door<00:01:23.660> for<00:01:23.930> those<00:01:24.020> notes<00:01:24.350> that<00:01:24.590> you

00:03:29.089 --> 00:03:29.099 
of time and that's where we get back to

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:30.920 
of time and that's where we get back to
that<00:03:29.219> first<00:03:29.489> picture<00:03:29.670> again<00:03:30.030> which<00:03:30.569> I<00:03:30.689> need<00:03:30.840> to
