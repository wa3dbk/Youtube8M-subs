 ok let's see why of course 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.230

 I mean three embers worth 4 layer 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:30.899

 wangoy that is mango he is usually all 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:04.769
 tobacco is so easy to taste glycerin 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:09.420
 what a pronounced collage 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:11.440
 we are not at all expressed internally as 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:14.230
 then so 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:18.280
 you know how to, in principle, well manga not 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:19.950

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:23.290
 how else would loop 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:25.720
 Well, how would this and how we heard me 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:27.550

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:31.650
 cool 3 family delicious 

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:35.230
 it is not worth spending on it even 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:39.490
 commandment and these other tastes mage not 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:49.480

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:57.430

00:03:49.480 --> 00:04:04.240

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:10.570
 manga i say i haven't tried yet i 

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:14.230
 I think tasty with tobacco when we do not know 

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:16.330
 washed that is what we say about lemon 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:20.290

 good mix is â€‹â€‹very fresh and tasty

 so that the people try the test and 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:43.040
 in general, we choose a lemon 

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:46.760
 because it is more saturated more 

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:49.690
