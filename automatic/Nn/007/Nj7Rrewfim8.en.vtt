00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.879
 channel sponsor thermaltake 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.660
 thermaltake play even better all hello 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:09.300
 I am Dmitry 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.730
 and this is a techno kitchen 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:14.460
 the day we can give the exact answer 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.830
 oh 3 game processor or not we 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.730
 conducted dozens of tests on different 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.830
 video cards 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.680
 we compared a and 3 with several 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.840
 processors and only test in gta 5 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.630
 dotted i 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:30.480
 alas oh oh 3 failed the test with 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:36.170
 r9 280 video card 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:39.960
 1 and a drawdown where fx 8320 or 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:42.719
 8350 or and 5 go easy for almost a hundred 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.719
 percent revealing accelerator oh 3 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:49.079
 has four streams but these are weak streams 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:52.079
 hence the failures and 5 has a frequency even 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:55.079
 lower but four full cores they 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:57.899
 virtual therefore copes better oh 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:02.039
 3 does not even save the optimization of the game under 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:04.439
 intel fx 8320 cheaper architecture 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:08.790
 faster a but yes there is 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:11.490
 fx 83 2 0 even cheaper exactly in 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.770
 camp budget we can't call oh 3 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:17.100
 our choice is our budget 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:21.330
 processor for games this place will take 83 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:23.460
 2 0 or 8320 a md won in the budget 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.880
 the gaming processor selection sector for 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:29.670
 games in other games also md 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:32.430
 processor looks better exception 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:35.280
 Is that tanks that md processor and 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:38.220
 digest very badly there is such 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.000
 game when enlight where oh 3 can be 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.759
 in front 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.759
 if the m2 processor is not overclocked therefore 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:46.860
 after weighing all the pros and cons you can say 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:49.950
 if you build a budget computer 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:52.740
 for a long time that is inexpensive but stable 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:57.000
 overclocking md motherboards list 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:02:01.229
 under the video and take them to them fx 8320 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.180
 or 83 2 0 and 3 is the best and 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:06.450
 more expensive truth gag 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:08.789
 regarding Pentium g 3258 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.739
 that is a good solution when it costs 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:12.200
 the task is to play some 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:14.599
 months in waiting 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:18.290
 gray given 5 entry level or on 

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:20.690
 the ultimate in the form of 4690 kei that is if 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:24.170
 back com we advise to mess only 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:26.660
 for pk for tanks ti3 more omnivorous but 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:29.300
 still requires a processor upgrade 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:31.970
 And you can not say that oh 3 office 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:34.819
 the solution is now the Internet is littered with engines 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:35.390
 sites advertising videos that oh three 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:38.150
 mall 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:41.420
 so we do not recommend it as a basis 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:44.060
 and for office so far, too, we found one 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:46.430
 exactly modern games and programs 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.090
 more sharpened under the streams than under 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.549
 cleanliness 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:52.120
 so penechek two cores which 

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:54.920
 operate at 4 and 7 gigahertz 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:57.410
 loses to dual core oh three frames 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:59.269
 which operate on frequency 3 and 4 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:02.150
 gigahertz fiction 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:05.630
 but 4 virtual threads do their job 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:08.269
 here if intel unlocked abe oe 3 here 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:11.030
 then we could get a killer md 

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:13.459
 processors and all at once but then 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:15.230
 blue could not sell oh 5 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:18.470
 that wouldn't be needed at all 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:23.290
 that was our view on altri not gaming 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:23.290
 the processor and with you was dmitry all bye
