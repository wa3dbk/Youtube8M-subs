here this is the primary class that I've

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.049 
here this is the primary class that I've
been<00:00:38.520> running<00:00:38.879> with<00:00:39.030> in<00:00:39.570> the<00:00:40.070> beta<00:00:41.070> so<00:00:41.610> we<00:00:41.940> have

been running with in the beta so we have
the<00:00:42.180> locust<00:00:42.540> of<00:00:42.629> course<00:00:42.960> the<00:00:43.829> optic<00:00:44.489> sight<00:00:44.910> is

the locust of course the optic sight is

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.590 
the locust of course the optic sight is
the<00:00:45.719> thermal<00:00:46.410> scope<00:00:46.500> it's<00:00:47.219> my<00:00:47.969> preferred<00:00:48.300> one

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
the thermal scope it's my preferred one

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.900 
the thermal scope it's my preferred one
it<00:00:48.989> is<00:00:49.200> tops<00:00:49.920> it's<00:00:50.250> probably<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:50.730> best

it is tops it's probably the best
thermal<00:00:51.390> scope<00:00:51.840> we've<00:00:52.079> ever<00:00:52.260> had<00:00:52.500> in<00:00:52.710> any<00:00:52.920> call

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
thermal scope we've ever had in any call

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.380 
thermal scope we've ever had in any call
duty<00:00:53.489> it's<00:00:53.730> just<00:00:54.120> you<00:00:54.840> know<00:00:54.960> it's<00:00:55.110> just<00:00:55.260> clean

definitely the thermal scope I use it

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.000 
definitely the thermal scope I use it
around<00:01:02.190> 80%<00:01:02.850> of<00:01:03.270> time<00:01:03.510> then<00:01:03.899> the<00:01:04.110> other<00:01:04.199> 20%<00:01:04.589> I

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
around 80% of time then the other 20% I

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.219 
around 80% of time then the other 20% I
use<00:01:05.159> defaults<00:01:05.790> go<00:01:05.909> because<00:01:06.180> it's<00:01:06.330> not<00:01:06.570> bad<00:01:06.810> the

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:08.840 
use defaults go because it's not bad the
default<00:01:07.619> scope<00:01:07.799> is<00:01:07.979> not<00:01:08.010> bad<00:01:08.340> at<00:01:08.520> all

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
default scope is not bad at all

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.490 
default scope is not bad at all
just<00:01:09.479> that<00:01:09.630> I<00:01:09.659> have<00:01:09.960> a<00:01:09.990> lot<00:01:10.170> of<00:01:10.200> fun<00:01:10.409> playing

just that I have a lot of fun playing
with<00:01:10.650> the<00:01:10.799> thermal<00:01:11.100> scope<00:01:11.250> so<00:01:11.490> that's<00:01:11.760> my

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
with the thermal scope so that's my

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.810 
with the thermal scope so that's my
number<00:01:12.420> one<00:01:13.010> you<00:01:14.010> know<00:01:14.130> attachment<00:01:14.700> that<00:01:14.760> I

number one you know attachment that I

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.050 
number one you know attachment that I
rock<00:01:15.150> with<00:01:15.420> with<00:01:15.689> the<00:01:16.159> locust<00:01:17.159> second<00:01:17.939> of

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
rock with with the locust second of

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.969 
rock with with the locust second of
course<00:01:18.270> is<00:01:18.540> rapid<00:01:18.900> fire<00:01:19.049> you<00:01:19.320> have<00:01:19.530> to<00:01:19.590> use

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
course is rapid fire you have to use

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.609 
course is rapid fire you have to use
rapid<00:01:20.310> fire<00:01:20.520> on<00:01:20.759> the<00:01:20.880> locust<00:01:21.240> it<00:01:21.689> does<00:01:22.259> help

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
rapid fire on the locust it does help

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.039 
rapid fire on the locust it does help
you<00:01:23.520> know<00:01:23.640> get<00:01:23.939> shots<00:01:24.270> off<00:01:24.450> faster<00:01:24.930> of<00:01:25.020> course

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
you know get shots off faster of course

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.899 
you know get shots off faster of course
increases<00:01:25.740> rate<00:01:26.070> of<00:01:26.189> fire<00:01:26.369> pretty

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
increases rate of fire pretty

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.300 
increases rate of fire pretty
self-explanatory<00:01:27.299> there<00:01:28.049> it<00:01:28.890> does<00:01:29.070> make<00:01:29.280> a

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
self-explanatory there it does make a

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:30.679 
self-explanatory there it does make a
huge<00:01:29.640> difference<00:01:30.090> when<00:01:30.270> you're<00:01:30.420> sniping

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
huge difference when you're sniping

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:36.050 
huge difference when you're sniping
trust<00:01:31.350> me<00:01:32.119> for<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:33.240> secondary<00:01:34.310> rk5<00:01:35.369> I<00:01:35.670> don't

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
trust me for the secondary rk5 I don't

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.609 
trust me for the secondary rk5 I don't
have<00:01:36.329> this<00:01:36.600> one<00:01:36.659> unlocked<00:01:37.200> but<00:01:37.380> I<00:01:37.439> could

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
have this one unlocked but I could

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.890 
have this one unlocked but I could
already<00:01:37.740> tell<00:01:38.009> that<00:01:38.579> the<00:01:38.820> rk5<00:01:39.329> is<00:01:39.570> going<00:01:39.720> to<00:01:39.780> be

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
already tell that the rk5 is going to be

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.380 
already tell that the rk5 is going to be
the<00:01:40.020> best<00:01:40.640> secondary<00:01:41.640> because<00:01:41.820> it's<00:01:42.180> pretty

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
the best secondary because it's pretty

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.219 
the best secondary because it's pretty
much<00:01:42.509> like<00:01:42.570> a<00:01:42.720> b23r<00:01:43.439> from<00:01:43.950> black<00:01:44.280> ops<00:01:44.549> 2<00:01:44.850> and

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:45.229 
much like a b23r from black ops 2 and

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:49.100 
much like a b23r from black ops 2 and
you<00:01:46.229> know<00:01:46.320> it's<00:01:46.680> it's<00:01:47.520> really<00:01:48.210> really<00:01:48.659> really

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590 
concussions like two of them at the same

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:13.729

stunned<00:04:14.130> and<00:04:14.459> flashed<00:04:15.420> in<00:04:15.840> this<00:04:16.500> game<00:04:16.770> it's

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130

absolutely crazy it drives me crazy
so<00:04:20.669> tactical<00:04:21.299> mass<00:04:21.479> is<00:04:21.720> definitely<00:04:22.109> going<00:04:22.200> to

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:22.260 
so tactical mass is definitely going to

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:23.370 
so tactical mass is definitely going to
be<00:04:22.350> one

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:23.380 
be one

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:25.350 
be one
that<00:04:23.530> one<00:04:24.100> perk<00:04:24.340> that<00:04:24.490> I<00:04:24.550> really<00:04:24.910> want<00:04:25.090> to<00:04:25.180> use

that one perk that I really want to use

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.030 
that one perk that I really want to use
but<00:04:25.660> of<00:04:25.780> course<00:04:26.080> on<00:04:26.320> the<00:04:26.440> other<00:04:26.590> hand<00:04:26.860> you<00:04:27.010> have

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:27.040 
but of course on the other hand you have

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.770 
but of course on the other hand you have
blast<00:04:27.520> suppressor<00:04:27.640> and<00:04:28.150> it<00:04:28.240> keeps<00:04:28.450> you<00:04:28.630> off

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:28.780 
blast suppressor and it keeps you off

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:31.170 
blast suppressor and it keeps you off
the<00:04:28.930> mini-map<00:04:29.230> whenever<00:04:29.830> you<00:04:30.040> use<00:04:30.310> your<00:04:30.790> your

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:31.180 
the mini-map whenever you use your your

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:33.480 
the mini-map whenever you use your your
boost<00:04:31.540> or<00:04:31.900> your<00:04:32.050> slide<00:04:32.410> and<00:04:32.680> you're<00:04:33.280> pretty

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:33.490 
boost or your slide and you're pretty

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:35.730 
boost or your slide and you're pretty
much<00:04:33.640> using<00:04:33.700> that<00:04:34.150> all<00:04:34.360> the<00:04:34.630> time<00:04:34.900> so<00:04:35.380> picking

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:35.740 
much using that all the time so picking

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:37.140 
much using that all the time so picking
between<00:04:35.950> these<00:04:36.370> two<00:04:36.520> is<00:04:36.610> going<00:04:36.730> to<00:04:36.790> be<00:04:36.880> really

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:37.150 
between these two is going to be really

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:38.820 
between these two is going to be really
hard<00:04:37.330> but<00:04:37.570> I<00:04:37.600> think<00:04:37.690> you<00:04:38.350> know<00:04:38.470> whenever<00:04:38.650> I
