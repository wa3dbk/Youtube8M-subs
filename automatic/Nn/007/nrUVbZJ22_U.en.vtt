debrief and 1 together this is early

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:52.549 
debrief and 1 together this is early
days<00:00:46.370> through<00:00:47.370> eighth<00:00:47.640> grade<00:00:48.270> I<00:00:51.410> recommend<00:00:52.410> it

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
days through eighth grade I recommend it

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.319 
days through eighth grade I recommend it
I<00:00:52.710> would<00:00:53.039> say<00:00:53.250> definitely<00:00:53.550> I've<00:00:54.000> been<00:00:54.180> through

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
I would say definitely I've been through

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.270 
I would say definitely I've been through
this<00:00:54.390> process<00:00:54.600> before<00:00:54.899> I<00:00:55.140> think<00:00:55.289> that<00:00:55.710> for

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
this process before I think that for

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.619 
this process before I think that for
some<00:00:56.460> of<00:00:56.520> the<00:00:56.640> same<00:00:56.760> reasons<00:00:56.910> I<00:00:57.120> said<00:00:57.300> before<00:00:57.420> I

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
some of the same reasons I said before I

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.619 
some of the same reasons I said before I
think<00:00:57.840> it's<00:00:57.960> it<00:00:58.440> really<00:00:58.710> I<00:00:59.210> think<00:01:00.210> is<00:01:00.449> really

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
think it's it really I think is really

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.119 
think it's it really I think is really
helpful<00:01:00.719> I<00:01:01.109> think<00:01:01.140> did<00:01:01.469> you<00:01:01.590> confidence

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
helpful I think did you confidence

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.000 
helpful I think did you confidence
denisa<00:01:02.670> that<00:01:02.850> ever<00:01:03.090> some<00:01:03.860> one<00:01:04.860> of<00:01:04.920> the

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
denisa that ever some one of the

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.470 
denisa that ever some one of the
problems<00:01:05.280> was<00:01:05.400> a<00:01:05.430> trust<00:01:05.790> issue<00:01:05.940> but<00:01:06.240> I<00:01:06.300> think

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:06.480 
problems was a trust issue but I think

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:07.910 
problems was a trust issue but I think
the<00:01:06.570> protocols<00:01:07.110> going<00:01:07.440> through<00:01:07.590> that<00:01:07.680> whole

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
the protocols going through that whole

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.420 
the protocols going through that whole
protocol<00:01:08.400> process<00:01:08.910> and<00:01:09.890> setting<00:01:10.890> it<00:01:11.010> up<00:01:11.070> what

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
protocol process and setting it up what

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:12.620 
protocol process and setting it up what
you<00:01:11.490> want<00:01:11.640> people<00:01:11.790> to<00:01:11.910> look<00:01:12.060> at<00:01:12.180> I<00:01:12.240> think<00:01:12.480> that

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
you want people to look at I think that

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.290 
you want people to look at I think that
trusts<00:01:12.930> people<00:01:13.400> might<00:01:14.400> be<00:01:14.550> very<00:01:14.850> mistrustful

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:15.300 
trusts people might be very mistrustful

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:17.330 
trusts people might be very mistrustful
at<00:01:15.960> the<00:01:16.080> beginning<00:01:16.410> of<00:01:16.560> it<00:01:16.740> but<00:01:16.920> by<00:01:17.070> the<00:01:17.130> time

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
at the beginning of it but by the time

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.280 
at the beginning of it but by the time
they<00:01:17.490> go<00:01:17.580> through<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:17.820> process<00:01:18.270> and<00:01:18.480> be<00:01:18.780> time

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
they go through the process and be time

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:20.960 
they go through the process and be time
they<00:01:19.470> finally<00:01:19.680> walk<00:01:19.950> into<00:01:20.220> the<00:01:20.310> classroom<00:01:20.850> I

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
they finally walk into the classroom I

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.340 
they finally walk into the classroom I
think<00:01:21.000> that<00:01:21.330> people<00:01:21.660> are<00:01:21.720> pretty<00:01:21.960> confident

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
think that people are pretty confident

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:23.810 
think that people are pretty confident
about<00:01:22.500> what's<00:01:22.770> going<00:01:22.920> to<00:01:22.980> go<00:01:23.100> on<00:01:23.250> and<00:01:23.700> what's

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
about what's going to go on and what's

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.520 
about what's going to go on and what's
going<00:01:24.060> to<00:01:24.150> happen<00:01:24.540> and<00:01:24.720> people<00:01:25.290> aren't<00:01:25.410> really

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
going to happen and people aren't really

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.140 
going to happen and people aren't really
going<00:01:25.710> to<00:01:25.800> judge<00:01:26.010> and<00:01:26.370> they're<00:01:26.730> really

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
going to judge and they're really

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.480 
going to judge and they're really
looking<00:01:27.270> for<00:01:27.480> specific<00:01:28.200> things<00:01:28.230> so<00:01:28.530> I<00:01:29.190> would

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
looking for specific things so I would

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.040 
looking for specific things so I would
totally<00:01:29.670> recommend<00:01:29.850> ever<00:01:30.330> you<00:01:30.690> know<00:01:30.780> for<00:01:30.960> new

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:31.050 
totally recommend ever you know for new

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:32.390 
totally recommend ever you know for new
teachers<00:01:31.290> for<00:01:31.590> veteran<00:01:31.920> teachers<00:01:32.250> I<00:01:32.370> think

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
teachers for veteran teachers I think

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.420 
teachers for veteran teachers I think
it's<00:01:32.670> a<00:01:32.730> really<00:01:32.970> good<00:01:33.090> way<00:01:33.750> to<00:01:34.370> improve<00:01:35.370> your

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
it's a really good way to improve your

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.400 
it's a really good way to improve your
teaching<00:01:35.820> and<00:01:36.000> just<00:01:36.290> improve<00:01:37.290> your

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:37.410

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:39.740 
teaching and just improve your
relationships<00:01:37.950> if<00:01:38.910> you<00:01:39.210> really<00:01:39.570> want

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
relationships if you really want

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.570

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:41.580 
feedback and Bute and can be very

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:43.490

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650 
regular conversations with the peer I

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:53.070 
regular conversations with the peer I
would<00:02:51.010> highly<00:02:51.340> recommend<00:02:51.370> it<00:02:52.030> especially<00:02:52.390> at

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:53.080 
would highly recommend it especially at

00:02:53.080 --> 00:03:00.199 
would highly recommend it especially at
buildings<00:02:54.070> where<00:02:54.340> you<00:02:54.370> don't<00:02:54.790> get<00:02:55.060> to<00:02:55.420> see

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:28.160 

it's<00:03:01.209> really<00:03:01.690> nice<00:03:01.959> to<00:03:02.530> see<00:03:13.110> you<00:03:14.110> know<00:03:14.200> I'm

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:32.490 

teaching<00:03:29.170> that<00:03:29.530> we<00:03:29.739> are<00:03:30.519> so<00:03:30.700> isolated<00:03:31.500> there's

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500 
teaching that we are so isolated there's

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:36.420 
teaching that we are so isolated there's
so<00:03:32.739> many<00:03:32.920> great<00:03:33.519> teachers<00:03:35.130> see<00:03:36.130> what<00:03:36.280> you're

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:36.430 
so many great teachers see what you're

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:39.570 
so many great teachers see what you're
doing<00:03:36.760> I<00:03:36.940> think<00:03:37.239> there's<00:03:38.170> the<00:03:38.530> potential<00:03:39.160> for

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:39.580 
doing I think there's the potential for

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:45.000 
doing I think there's the potential for
that<00:03:39.700> depending<00:03:40.299> on<00:03:40.830> the<00:03:41.830> team<00:03:42.220> and<00:03:42.549> how<00:03:44.010> how

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.010 
that depending on the team and how how

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:47.490 
that depending on the team and how how
much<00:03:45.190> trust<00:03:45.700> there<00:03:46.060> is<00:03:46.239> and<00:03:46.570> what<00:03:47.230> they

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:47.500 
much trust there is and what they

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:50.970 
much trust there is and what they
actually<00:03:48.310> want<00:03:48.610> from<00:03:48.970> it<00:03:49.060> and<00:03:49.480> I<00:03:50.290> think<00:03:50.350> that

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:50.980 
actually want from it and I think that

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:55.050 
actually want from it and I think that
that<00:03:51.880> that<00:03:52.510> you<00:03:53.049> need<00:03:53.350> to<00:03:53.590> know<00:03:53.799> what<00:03:54.400> you<00:03:54.790> want

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:55.060 
that that you need to know what you want

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:57.960 
that that you need to know what you want
to<00:03:55.269> get<00:03:55.420> out<00:03:55.690> of<00:03:55.989> it<00:03:56.170> before<00:03:56.890> you<00:03:56.920> go<00:03:57.310> into<00:03:57.640> it

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:57.970 
to get out of it before you go into it

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:01.259 
to get out of it before you go into it
and<00:03:58.420> that<00:03:59.320> might<00:03:59.650> help<00:04:00.310> so<00:04:01.000> the

00:04:01.259 --> 00:04:01.269 
and that might help so the

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:03.710 
and that might help so the

clear<00:04:30.810> and<00:04:30.840> focused<00:04:31.289> purpose<00:04:31.620> on<00:04:31.830> how<00:04:32.370> it<00:04:32.490> will

00:04:32.629 --> 00:04:32.639 
clear and focused purpose on how it will

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:34.850 
clear and focused purpose on how it will
improve<00:04:32.940> our<00:04:33.180> instruction<00:04:33.930> our<00:04:34.320> common

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:34.860 
improve our instruction our common

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:38.590 
improve our instruction our common
problem<00:04:35.340> with<00:04:35.430> practice<00:04:35.940> we<00:04:36.780> identified<00:04:37.440> is

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:38.600 
problem with practice we identified is

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:41.180 
problem with practice we identified is
it<00:04:39.600> was<00:04:39.750> during<00:04:39.990> writing<00:04:40.320> we<00:04:40.440> observed<00:04:41.039> each

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:41.190 
it was during writing we observed each

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:43.730 
it was during writing we observed each
other<00:04:41.400> during<00:04:42.330> writing<00:04:42.900> conferences<00:04:43.440> and

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:43.740 
other during writing conferences and

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:45.980 
other during writing conferences and
what<00:04:44.460> we<00:04:44.550> wanted<00:04:44.910> to<00:04:45.060> see<00:04:45.300> is<00:04:45.509> are<00:04:45.780> the

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:45.990 
what we wanted to see is are the

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:48.230 
what we wanted to see is are the
children<00:04:46.530> who<00:04:46.979> are<00:04:47.160> not<00:04:47.460> being<00:04:47.789> conferred

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:48.240 
children who are not being conferred

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:50.650 
children who are not being conferred
with<00:04:48.330> on<00:04:48.750> task<00:04:49.169> during<00:04:49.740> that<00:04:50.010> time<00:04:50.280> and<00:04:50.460> how

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:50.660 
with on task during that time and how

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:53.800 
with on task during that time and how
independent<00:04:51.660> our<00:04:52.050> children<00:04:52.560> during<00:04:53.370> that

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:53.810 
independent our children during that

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:56.029 
independent our children during that
that<00:04:54.810> block<00:04:55.110> of<00:04:55.320> time<00:04:55.470> during<00:04:55.680> the<00:04:55.800> Writers

that block of time during the Writers
Workshop<00:04:56.070> in<00:04:56.880> writing<00:04:57.240> and<00:04:57.630> so<00:04:58.639> we<00:04:59.639> decided<00:05:00.060> to

00:05:00.529 --> 00:05:00.539 
Workshop in writing and so we decided to

00:05:00.539 --> 00:05:03.080 
Workshop in writing and so we decided to
do<00:05:00.840> one<00:05:01.740> on<00:05:01.889> one<00:05:02.070> observation<00:05:02.729> so<00:05:02.910> there's

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:03.090 
do one on one observation so there's

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:06.409 
do one on one observation so there's
four<00:05:03.330> of<00:05:03.360> us<00:05:03.539> and<00:05:03.900> I<00:05:04.699> observed<00:05:05.699> one<00:05:06.000> colleague

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:16.440 
didn't have to get a substitute and we

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:18.290 
didn't have to get a substitute and we
came<00:05:16.680> up<00:05:16.830> with<00:05:16.949> a<00:05:17.009> format<00:05:17.460> basically<00:05:18.000> looking

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:18.300 
came up with a format basically looking

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:20.240 
came up with a format basically looking
at<00:05:18.419> our<00:05:18.750> children<00:05:19.169> using<00:05:19.380> materials

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:20.250 
at our children using materials

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:23.770 
at our children using materials
independently<00:05:21.090> on<00:05:22.050> task<00:05:22.650> behavior

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:23.780 
independently on task behavior

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:28.159 
independently on task behavior
level<00:05:24.780> of<00:05:25.020> noise<00:05:25.289> and<00:05:26.690> confer<00:05:27.690> impress<00:05:27.990> the

00:05:28.159 --> 00:05:28.169 
level of noise and confer impress the

00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:30.230 
level of noise and confer impress the
sweater<00:05:28.410> what<00:05:28.740> are<00:05:28.889> the<00:05:29.039> how<00:05:29.460> many<00:05:29.760> kids<00:05:30.120> are

sweater what are the how many kids are

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:31.850 
sweater what are the how many kids are
is<00:05:30.510> the<00:05:30.660> teacher<00:05:30.870> getting<00:05:31.199> to<00:05:31.440> does<00:05:31.620> it<00:05:31.650> look

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:31.860 
is the teacher getting to does it look

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:33.710 
is the teacher getting to does it look
like<00:05:32.010> the<00:05:32.250> compasses<00:05:32.760> are<00:05:32.940> being<00:05:33.150> effective

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:33.720 
like the compasses are being effective

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:35.390 
like the compasses are being effective
you<00:05:34.050> hear<00:05:34.229> it<00:05:34.320> again<00:05:34.380> and<00:05:34.530> again<00:05:34.680> it's<00:05:34.919> such<00:05:35.220> an

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:35.400 
you hear it again and again it's such an

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:38.360 
you hear it again and again it's such an
isolating<00:05:36.240> profession<00:05:36.900> and<00:05:37.169> it's<00:05:37.740> the<00:05:37.949> Verity

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:38.370 
isolating profession and it's the Verity

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:40.640 
isolating profession and it's the Verity
that's<00:05:38.789> the<00:05:39.000> very<00:05:39.240> opposite<00:05:39.750> practice<00:05:40.229> that<00:05:40.620> I

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:40.650 
that's the very opposite practice that I

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:44.149 
that's the very opposite practice that I
think<00:05:41.010> it's<00:05:41.490> a<00:05:41.610> people<00:05:42.000> profession<00:05:42.570> and<00:05:43.159> we're

00:05:44.149 --> 00:05:44.159 
think it's a people profession and we're

00:05:44.159 --> 00:05:45.920 
think it's a people profession and we're
in<00:05:44.310> our<00:05:44.460> rooms<00:05:44.699> with<00:05:45.090> the<00:05:45.180> door<00:05:45.389> closed<00:05:45.690> if

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:45.930 
in our rooms with the door closed if

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:47.330 
in our rooms with the door closed if
you're<00:05:46.080> you<00:05:46.500> know<00:05:46.530> looking<00:05:46.889> up<00:05:47.039> to<00:05:47.159> have<00:05:47.310> a

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:47.340 
you're you know looking up to have a

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:51.890 
you're you know looking up to have a
door<00:05:47.550> and<00:05:47.820> yeah<00:05:48.780> and<00:05:50.120> you<00:05:51.120> just<00:05:51.150> think<00:05:51.630> you

was<00:05:55.080> amazing<00:05:55.800> what<00:05:56.789> I<00:05:56.820> thought<00:05:57.270> I<00:05:57.330> was<00:05:57.690> saying

00:05:57.950 --> 00:05:57.960 
was amazing what I thought I was saying

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:00.170 
was amazing what I thought I was saying
and<00:05:58.229> what<00:05:58.560> I<00:05:58.590> thought<00:05:59.099> they<00:05:59.430> were<00:05:59.490> getting<00:05:59.970> and

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:00.180 
and what I thought they were getting and

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:02.899 
and what I thought they were getting and
how<00:06:00.479> that<00:06:00.720> was<00:06:00.900> very<00:06:01.260> different<00:06:01.710> and<00:06:02.190> it<00:06:02.760> was

00:06:02.899 --> 00:06:02.909 
how that was very different and it was

00:06:02.909 --> 00:06:06.260 
how that was very different and it was
so<00:06:03.570> many<00:06:03.949> ahahahahaha<00:06:04.949> all<00:06:05.340> along<00:06:05.729> the<00:06:05.849> way<00:06:06.030> I

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:06.270 
so many ahahahahaha all along the way I

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:08.360 
so many ahahahahaha all along the way I
think<00:06:06.630> another<00:06:07.050> real<00:06:07.349> positive<00:06:07.860> of<00:06:07.979> this<00:06:08.130> is

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:08.370 
think another real positive of this is

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:12.830 
think another real positive of this is
that<00:06:08.550> it<00:06:08.699> gives<00:06:08.729> a<00:06:09.479> team<00:06:10.139> a<00:06:10.560> chance<00:06:11.250> to<00:06:11.880> grow<00:06:12.539> as

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:12.840 
that it gives a team a chance to grow as

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:14.870 
that it gives a team a chance to grow as
a<00:06:12.870> team<00:06:13.289> and<00:06:13.590> talk<00:06:13.919> in<00:06:14.099> a<00:06:14.159> way<00:06:14.310> that<00:06:14.520> you<00:06:14.610> can't
