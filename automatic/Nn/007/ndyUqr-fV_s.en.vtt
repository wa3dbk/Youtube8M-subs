and take a tumble I am now going to

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:25.020 
and take a tumble I am now going to
demonstrate<00:02:23.470> a<00:02:23.890> basic<00:02:24.070> technique<00:02:24.640> for<00:02:24.820> using

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
demonstrate a basic technique for using

demonstrate a basic technique for using
the<00:02:25.300> sliding<00:02:25.630> board<00:02:26.190> so<00:02:27.190> basically<00:02:27.520> what

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
the sliding board so basically what

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:28.440 
the sliding board so basically what
you're<00:02:27.820> going<00:02:27.910> to<00:02:27.970> do<00:02:28.090> is<00:02:28.210> you're<00:02:28.300> going<00:02:28.330> to

you're going to do is you're going to

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:29.910 
you're going to do is you're going to
start<00:02:28.690> up<00:02:28.840> you're<00:02:29.050> gonna<00:02:29.170> stand<00:02:29.440> against<00:02:29.740> the

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
start up you're gonna stand against the

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.070 
start up you're gonna stand against the
side<00:02:30.130> of<00:02:30.340> it<00:02:30.460> the<00:02:31.150> one<00:02:31.540> of<00:02:31.630> the<00:02:31.690> push<00:02:31.870> off

side of it the one of the push off

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.110 
side of it the one of the push off
blocks<00:02:32.350> the<00:02:33.190> important<00:02:33.580> thing<00:02:33.670> about<00:02:33.730> using

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
blocks the important thing about using

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:35.250 
blocks the important thing about using
the<00:02:34.180> side<00:02:34.360> words<00:02:34.600> you<00:02:34.720> have<00:02:34.870> to<00:02:34.990> bend<00:02:35.170> your

the side words you have to bend your

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:36.420 
the side words you have to bend your
knees<00:02:35.500> because<00:02:35.830> you've<00:02:35.950> got<00:02:36.070> to<00:02:36.160> be<00:02:36.220> able<00:02:36.280> to

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
generate enough power to be able to push

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:41.910 
generate enough power to be able to push
yourself<00:02:39.340> all<00:02:39.730> the<00:02:39.850> way<00:02:39.880> across<00:02:40.210> so<00:02:40.830> what<00:02:41.830> you

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
yourself all the way across so what you

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:42.720

slightly

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.420 
slightly
now<00:02:43.660> as<00:02:43.900> you're<00:02:44.080> more<00:02:44.260> advanced<00:02:44.620> skaters<00:02:45.160> or

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
now as you're more advanced skaters or

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.700 
now as you're more advanced skaters or
you're<00:02:45.940> more<00:02:46.120> advanced<00:02:46.390> your<00:02:46.930> bendy<00:02:47.320> bin<00:02:47.530> is

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:47.710 
you're more advanced your bendy bin is

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:49.140 
you're more advanced your bendy bin is
going<00:02:47.890> to<00:02:47.950> be<00:02:48.100> a<00:02:48.370> little<00:02:48.850> bit<00:02:49.000> deeper

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
going to be a little bit deeper

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.090 
going to be a little bit deeper
depending<00:02:49.750> on<00:02:49.870> your<00:02:50.080> level<00:02:50.290> of<00:02:50.590> expertise

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.100 
depending on your level of expertise

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:52.710 
depending on your level of expertise
with<00:02:51.310> the<00:02:51.340> sideboard<00:02:51.940> and<00:02:52.060> level<00:02:52.360> of<00:02:52.450> strength

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
with the sideboard and level of strength

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.050 
with the sideboard and level of strength
and<00:02:52.990> so<00:02:53.110> on<00:02:53.190> so<00:02:54.190> basically<00:02:54.580> what<00:02:54.820> you're<00:02:54.940> gonna

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.060

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190 
push off the leg up against it so you

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:07.979 
push off the leg up against it so you
bring<00:03:06.340> your<00:03:06.400> foot<00:03:06.640> over<00:03:07.120> and<00:03:07.330> just<00:03:07.780> kind<00:03:07.959> of

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:13.209 
this before you foot back and then you

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:15.630 
this before you foot back and then you
