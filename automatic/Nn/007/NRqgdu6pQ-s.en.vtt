 they only brought me to do 

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:39.820
 some things to contribute to the team 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.100
 to pay attention to what he does to me 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:44.829
 and that I am trying to do the best 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:46.720
 from me on the court to be able to leave 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:48.519
 champions that what we want now and 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:50.199

00:00:48.519 --> 00:00:52.269

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:56.079
 aspect of andres everything all very well 

00:00:52.269 --> 00:00:58.149
 excellent was born as long as my god is me 

00:00:56.079 --> 00:01:00.010
 I raise hoping that this weekend 

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:02.400
 today a good goal is not the one that 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:06.549
 you make and obviously the celebration for the 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:09.180
 cycle 2 what what is the first goal 

00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:12.570
 what do I do after they make me my son 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:15.330
 then it just says something the mind was 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.910
 my mind was to be held in the sand already 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.280
 that is in Colombia then I did not have the 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:22.710
 fortune to go up close to him but 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.210
 send from here today andrés as you have 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.310
 seen this america you're surprised that 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.720
 where it stops crowded the stadiums and there are 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.670
 a lot of fans of the america that play 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:33.060
 practically from local everywhere you 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:35.010
 has surprised if I knew it was that 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.100
 it's a very big team america is a 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:39.510
 very big team but I did not imagine 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:42.420
 so much of the hobby for example being in 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:46.280
 cancún and that was more local in us 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:49.200
 that seattle before I was also watching 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:51.000
 when we go to the Aztec channel they told me 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.000
 that it was not full but it would be 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.140
 a lot of awesome people 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.590
 So that means it's all a 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:00.450
 very big team today in the competition 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.220
 for that greatness of the team that is 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.440
 important not to have accounts that 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:06.660
 they are level but those that enter 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:08.009
 are at the same or better I do not know was noticed in 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:09.959
 this match against atlante that came on 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.700
 hobby and revolutionized the game enters 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:14.819
 this all illusion in a wonderful way 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:19.480
 excellent players of a quality 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:21.280
 impressive then there is a 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.140
 very healthy competition between the group 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.269
 everyone wants to be in no holder 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:27.250
 he wants to be a substitute and we are aiming 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:29.560
 that's what we are preparing to do 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:32.230
 things in the best way to get to 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.790
 be a starter today pipe quickly when 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:35.500
 You find quality in your classmates 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:37.180
 america a very large campus with a lot 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.370
 quality is easier to develop 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:41.769
 football that you have that easier 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:44.680
 mate easier to play good football 

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:47.500
 that relatively what I like my 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:49.569
 players with good technique and almost never 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.579
 they lose the ball, there are accurate passes 

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:53.380
 then it's very good on that side 

00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:54.880
 finally andrés well the game against 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:56.709
